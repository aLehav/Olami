Nationwide police brutality sparks 
 

dialogue on local law enforcement

Over 1,000 march 
through downtown 

for Black Lives 
Matter protest 

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Daily Staff Reporter

More than 500 people gathered 

Wednesday at the Michigan Union 
to march through downtown Ann 
Arbor in protest of police brutality. 
After congregating at the Union, 
the protesters walked down State 
Street and Main Street, stopping 
several times along the way before 

regrouping at the Diag to have 
several people address the crowd. 
The Ann Arbor Police Department 
escorted 
the 
protest, 
directing 

traffic away.

The protest follows a recent 

streak of police violence — videos 
showing fatal police shootings of 
two men, Alton Sterling of Baton 
Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando 
Castile of St. Paul, Minnesota, 
launching a flurry of nationwide 
protests. A shootingspurred by a 
lone gunman last Thursday at a 
protest in Dallas claimed the lives 
of five police officers. A vigil for 
the victims was held last Thursday 
in Ann Arbor, and a smaller march 
Saturday through downtown was 

also organized in response.

Community-police 
relations 

in Ann Arbor have been sensitive 
since the 2014shooting death of Ann 
Arbor resident Aura Rosser by police 
officer David Ried. The county 
prosecuting attorney ruled Ried’s 
actions “lawful self defense,” though 
some residents were dissatisfied 
and skeptical of the results of the 
investigation.

In December 2015, the Ann Arbor 

Human Rights Commission put forth 
a 42-page report, recommending 
an independent audit of AAPD 
practices and the implementation 
of a civilian oversight board to 
independently review complaints 
against police officers. Although City 

Council voted in March to eagerly 
accept 
these 
recommendations, 

AAPD Chief Jim Baird expressed 
skepticism of the need for increased 
local oversight and stressed nothing 
be implemented until after an audit 
in a June memo.

Currently, the implementation 

of 
the 
HRC 
recommendations 

remains stalled, though money has 
been set aside in the city’s fiscal 
year 2017 budget for an auditor. City 
Councilmember Sumi Kailasapathy 
(D–Ward 1), who also is liaison to the 
HRC, told The Daily in an interview 
Wednesday she expects a resolution 
to hire an independent auditor soon 
— which would precede ordinance 
changes to implement an oversight 

body — but was unable to provide an 
exact timeline.

Kailasapathy 
added 
she 
did 

not believe the implementation of 
increased oversight was a reaction 
to deteriorating trust, but rather 
a 
check-and-balance 
on 
local 

government.

“This is not an indictment of our 

police force. This is about setting up 
checks and balances,” Kailasapathy 
said.

The atmosphere of the protest 

was high in energy, with marchers 
constantly chanting, “Hands up, 
don’t shoot,” as well as, “No justice, 
no peace” and “hey, hey, ho, ho, these 
racist cops have got to go!”

City Council votes 
to put election reform 
on November ballot

Ann Arbor residents 
will vote on proposal 

to extend city 

council term limits

By BRIAN KUANG

Summer Daily News Editor

In 
November, 
Ann 
Arbor 

residents will vote on a ballot 
measure that would extend the 
terms of city councilmembers and 
the mayor to four years — with the 
goal of boosting voter turnout in 
local elections — following a 7-4 
vote by City Council Wednesday 
evening.

However, a parallel resolution 

seeking to overhaul municipal 
elections 
into 
non-partisan 

blanket primaries — where party 
identification would not be listed 
for candidates — failed in a 7-4 
vote.

The 
two 
resolutions 
were 

introduced 
for 
debate 
by 

Council with the intention of 

comprehensively reforming 
local 
elections 
to 
boost 

sagging voter turnout.

Currently, the mayor and 

each 
city 
councilmember 

must run for re-election every 
two years, with five council 
seats up for election in any 
given year. Because there are 
no high-profile, top-ballot 
races — such as presidential 
or congressional campaigns 
— in odd-numbered years, 
voter 
turnout 
in 
August 

primary elections are often 
half of even-year numbers, 
and 
odd-year 
November 

turnout can be as low as one 
quarter of the corresponding 
even-year.

By extending terms of office 

for city councilmembers and the 
mayor, half of council would be 
up for re-election every two years 
during a high-profile general 
election that would drive turnout 
for down-ticket races.

Furthermore, many municipal 

races 
are 
not 
meaningfully 

contested in November due to 

Ann Arbor’s partisan election 
system, which is only used by two 
other cities in Michigan.

To be on the November ballot, 

candidates for city office must win 
either the statewide Republican 
or Democratic primary election 
in 
August, 
unless 
they 
are 

independent. 
However, 
given 

the demographic makeup of Ann 
Arbor, no candidate has sought 
election to municipal office as 

a Republican in Ann Arbor for 
over a decade, meaning many 
races are simply uncontested in 
November. City Councilmember 
Jane Lumm (I–Ward 2) remains 
the sole non-Democrat on City 
Council.

If a non-partisan election 

were to be adopted, then the top 
two receivers of votes in each 
August primary race would 
be guaranteed to advance to 
the November ballot, even if 
it would mean two Democrats 
would face against each other.

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy 
(D–Ward 
1) 

supported putting the non-
partisan election proposal to the 
November ballot, saying party 
labels in municipal elections 
often 
project 
inaccurate 

impressions 
of 
individual 

candidates to voters.

However, 
other 

councilmembers, 
including 

Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor, 

argued 
party 
labels 
still 

played an important role in 
informing voters on the values 
of 
candidates. 
Furthermore, 

Taylor said the lack of viability 

for Republican candidates in Ann 
Arbor is due to the ideological 
makeup of the city and not a 
result of any flaw in the city’s 
election system.

The 
extended-term 
ballot 

proposal was approved 7-4 with 
Councilmembers Lumm, Eaton, 
Kailasapathy 
and 
Graydon 

Krapohl 
(D–Ward 
4) 
voting 

against, 
while 
the 
parallel 

resolution seeking to overhaul 
municipal elections into non-
partisan blanket primaries failed 
7-4 with only Councilmembers 
Kirk 
Westphal 
(D–Ward 
2), 

Lumm, Chuck Warpehoski (D–
Ward 5) and Kailasapathy voting 
in favor.

Regarding 
term 
limits, 

Councilmember 
Sabra 
Briere 

(D–Ward 1) argued that even-
year elections would not only 
exclusively 
improve 
voter 

turnout, 
but 
longer 
terms 

increase continuity of leadership 
and allow councilmembers to 
pursue longer-term agendas.

Councilmember 
Jack 
Eaton 

(D–Ward 4) countered Briere’s 
point, saying that more frequent 
elections for city office would 
force councilmembers to be more 
accountable to their constituents 
and engage the public more 
frequently. Eaton also argued that 
even though turnout is higher in 
even-year elections, many voters 
in those elections simply vote 
along party lines without fully 
understanding city issues, while 
voters in lower-turnout odd-
years would be better engaged in 
local issues.

Candidates for City 
Council debate 
on televised forum

Issues include taxes, 
city development and 

transparency 

By ISHI MORI, KEVIN LINDER, 

and BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter, 

Summer Daily News Editor

Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 

candidates 
appeared 
Tuesday 

evening on a televised forum on 
pressing local policy issues on the 
Community Television Network. 
The forum featured candidates 
from Wards 1, 4 and 5 on different 
time slots. Wards 2 and 3 are 
uncontested this year.

Ward 1

Ward 1 featured incumbent 

Sumi Kailasapathy (D), Jason 
Frenzel (D) and Will Leaf (D). 
Kailasapathy is a certified public 
accountant 
at 
Edwards, 
Ellis, 

Armstrong & Co., a downtown 
accounting 
firm. 
Frenzel 
is 

the volunteer and stewardship 
coordinator for the Huron River 
Watershed Council. Leaf is the 
co-founder of online sunscreen 
company Natural Skin and Hair.

During the 45-minute program, 

the candidates traded opinions on 
a range of issues including traffic 
congestion, election reform and 
balancing the city budget.

A particular topic of contention 

was a redacted portion of e-mails 
regarding the construction of a 
planned Amtrak station. Frenzel 
said that, though he supported 
maximum transparency, he also 
felt that there was a justified 
reason for city staff to withhold 
information.

“I 
think 
in 
(the 
e-mail) 

conversation we need to realize 
what’s the situation,” Frenzel said. 
“We don’t as a public understand 
what that conversation is and what 
it was, why it was redacted. In my 
honest opinion, I know our staff 
to be strong, professional leaders 
in their industry … and I think 
challenging our staff in a public 
forum isn’t necessarily a valid way 
for an organization to behave.”

On the contrary, Kailasapathy 

said she is for greater transparency, 
especially since the documents 
in question will not jeopardize 
national security. 

“We are elected officials; I am 

not going to put this on the staff,” 
Kailasapathy said. “As elected 
officials, we have a duty to our 
residents to be transparent. And 
this, we need to remind ourselves, 
is regarding the location of a train 
station.”

When asked about how to 

balance the budget, all three 
agreed that restructuring current 
city 
spending 
can 
increase 

revenue.

Kailasapathy said the city can 

increase revenue by revisiting 
the 
tax 
capture 
policies 
of 

the 
Downtown 
Development 

Authority 
and 
the 
Local 

Development Funding Authority. 
She pointed out that the revenue 
for these entities increased by 50 
percent over the last four years and 
advocated redirecting that income 
to city funds.

Leaf 
argued 
that 
rezoning 

residential areas and allowing for 
more commercial enterprise can 
create more urban neighborhoods 
and increase tax revenues. He also 
strongly 
supported 
privatizing 

public parking, arguing that the 
city’s current monopoly on parking 
leads to an unneccessary loss of 
revenue. 

In a question pertaining to the 

city’s dioxane plume issue, Frenzel 
strongly 
criticized 
the 
state’s 

Department 
of 
Environmental 

Quality for its failure to control the 
spread of the plume. 

“The 
dioxane 
plume 
has 

been 
a 
known 
issue 
for 
35 

plus years,” Frenzel said. “It’s 
basically a status quo, and that’s 
extremely unfortunate. As an 
environmentalist, we know that 
the DEQ has been understaffed 
and beholden to corporations for 
a long time. I think we really need 
to fight hard to ensure that is no 
longer the case.”

All agreed that Ann Arbor 

should look for other funding 
options 
when 
it

Ann Arbor community members mourn the loss of Alton Sterling on Thursday in the Diag. 
At vigil, students and community 
mourn police brutality victims

Speakers discuss 

recent shootings and 
perspectives on lives 

as Black people

By IRENE PARK

Summer Daily News Editor

Thursday 
night, 
students 

and other community members 
gathered at the Diag to hold a 
candlelit vigil dedicated to Alton 
Sterling, who was fatally shot by 
Baton Rouge police officers outside 
a convenience store Tuesday in 
Louisiana, and Philando Castile, 
who was fatally shot Wednesday 
in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, at a 
traffic stop by a police officer.

The vigil was organized by a 

group of several University of 
Michigan students, who did not 
represent a specific organization 
on campus but collaborated in 
light of the recent events.

LSA junior Nikole Miller, one 

of the organizers, said she was 
motivated to organize the event 
because of her family.

“When you have men in your 

family, it hurts you,” Miller 
said. “I woke up this morning 
crying. When you feel that kind 

of pain, you know you have to do 
something.”

The 
vigil 
featured 
several 

speakers from the University 
community, who shared their 
perspectives on the recent events, 
life as a Black person and racism in 
general.

A 
few 
speakers 
discussed 

the details of the recent events, 
emphasizing that the shootings 
were 
not 
justified 
and 
that 

there is a deadly pattern in the 
interaction between the police 
and the Black community. LSA 
junior Arlyn Reed, who is also 
a Central Student Government 
representative, said this pattern is 
in part due to racism, and the lack 
of trust between young Black men 
and the police.

“What we should be able to 

plainly see is that this is in part — 
and I want to emphasize ‘in part’ 
— fueled by white supremacy, 
which reinforces the idea that 
Black 
bodies 
are 
inherently 

dangerous and feeds into the 
irrational 
fears 
about 
Black 

people,” Reed said. “What we 
should also be able to plainly see 
is the deadly disconnect between 
the young African American men 
and the police.”

LSA 
junior 
Mariah 
Smith 

shared her experiences growing 

up as a Black person, saying that 
initially she was afraid to be Black 
but she has embraced her identity 
as she grew up.

“To me, being Black meant being 

a slave, being powerless, being 
fearful and being unintelligent,” 
Smith said. “But now, I’m learning 
to embrace my Blackness. Being 
Black means something totally 
different to me now. It means 
intelligent, being strong, being 
powerful, being everything they 
said we aren’t.”

Many people of diverse racial 

backgrounds attended the vigil. 
Some of those in attendance 
who were not Black referred to 
themselves as “allies” of the cause. 
Rebecca Elias, a social worker in 
Ann Arbor, said she attended the 
vigil because she has been fighting 
against racism and the oppression 
of vulnerable people for many 
years.

Elias said that when she saw 

the video of Castile’s death, 
she was outraged by how the 
new generation will grow up 
witnessing the consequences of 
discrimination. She specifically 
mentioned Castile’s 4-year-old 
child, who was present in the 
car with Castile’s fiancée when 
Castile was shot.

The shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile have, yet again, sparked 

Black Lives Matter protests across the country, as well as in our own backyard. A 
candlelight vigil was held Thursday evening in the Diag for Sterling and Castile. As 
many as 200 community members marched through Ann Arbor Saturday afternoon 
and almost 1000 marched Wednesday night to protest police brutality and support 
the Black Lives Matter movement. The many voices crying out for justice have 
proven that police violence is an issue worth discussing to Ann Arbor citizens. As 
we see more of these voices of the Black Lives Matter movement and others speak 
out, we also see the formation of new policy platforms that hope to mitigate police 
brutality. For instance, “Campaign Zero,” which aims to create a world where “police 
don’t kill people,” has proposed a multitude of practical solutions. Among them is 
the notion of increasing community oversight of police officers. Policies like this one 
would greatly help to reduce the countless tragic, police-related deaths and should 
be enacted to ensure the safety and well being of all individuals.

A proactive approach to police oversight

FROM THE DAILY

KEVIN 
SWEITZER

Perez for VP

W

ith the conclusion of 
the 
2016 
presidential 

primaries, presumptive 

Democratic 
nominee 
Hillary Clinton 
has 
turned 

her 
attention 

toward 
presumptive 
Republican 

nominee Donald Trump and the 
November showdown that awaits 
them. While the 2016 election cycle 
has proven itself to be anything 
but normal, America finds itself at 
a crossroads once again: one key 
milestone remains that still mirrors 
the bygone days of presidential 
election campaigning.

The “veepstakes,” as they are so 

cleverly called by many a political 
pundit, is the mandatory process 
of choosing a vice presidential 
candidate to run and campaign with 
the nominee. As the name suggests, 
this process is more of a sweepstakes 
than it is about political clout, as 
the vice president rarely carries as 
much responsibility or respect as the 
president.

In the early days of this nation, 

the vice president was chosen as the 
second-place finisher in the general 
election. As one can easily imagine, 
this did not work out well, and as 
the two party system emerged, the 
parties started nominating their 
own candidates for vice president. 
This election year is no different, and 
despite all of the calamity associated 
with the election, Clinton will choose 
a Vice President.

Every four years, pundits across 

the nation talk about the benefits 
of every political player for vice 
president. However, at the end of 
the day, the role of the vice president 
is someone who can advise the 
president, serve in the cabinet and 
perform the duties of the president in 
the case of the president’s departure 
from office.

The last thing that Clinton needs 

when campaigning against Trump 
is another boring white man from 
Ohio (sorry, Sherrod Brown) or 
another lifelong politician with a 
history of shady contributions (sorry, 
Tim Kaine). Additionally, she cannot 
afford to risk flipping a Senate seat 
to the Republicans in a swing state 
(sorry, Cory Booker). Even worse 
would be an inexperienced or 
potentially unprepared politician 
who may not be able to perform the 
duties of vice president (sorry, Julian 
Castro). The only person fit for the 
current political climate of 2016 is 
someone who can use economic 
experience to appeal to everyday 
Americans, while understanding the 

complex social identity issues that 
are present in our nation today.

That’s 
why 
I 
urge 
Hillary 

Clinton to choose the Secretary of 
Labor Thomas Perez as her vice 
presidential nominee in 2016.

The 
son 
of 
Dominican 

immigrants, the Harvard educated 
Tom Perez spent much of his young 
life in the civil rights division of the 
U.S. Department of Justice, working 
primarily in the areas of migrant 
worker exploitation and hate crime 
prosecution. Once he jumped into 
the political landscape, he served 
as the director of the Maryland 
Department of Labor, Licensing and 
Regulation before becoming the 
head of the Civil Rights Division of 
the Department of Justice. Perez 
isn’t simply a Latina/o person who 
will fire up the base, he is an avid 
fighter for civil rights and the rights 
of working Americans. As assistant 
attorney general, he led many 
investigations into police violence 
and LGBT access to education, both 
of which are extremely important 
issues in our nation today.

As Secretary of Labor, he has 

been seen as a progressive leader, 
and has the support of many 
organized labor groups, including 
the largest congress of trade 
unions, the AFL-CIO. Clinton can 
work to repair any hard feelings 
with the Bernie Sanders camp by 
choosing a progressive labor leader 
as her running mate. Perez has 
spent his entire career fighting for 
what is right and what is just. This 
is the exact type of leadership that 
Clinton hopes to have and can work 
towards with Perez.

By choosing Tom Perez as her 

running mate, Hillary Clinton will 
be cementing her candidacy as 
the candidacy of equality, fairness 
and the rights of all Americans. 
She already has the foreign policy 
and economic experience to be a 
great leader, and can use Perez’s 
experience in civil rights advocacy 
and labor relations to address the 
key social issues of importance to 
our country. 

Donald 
Trump 
is 
not 
a 

traditional presidential candidate, 
and the 2016 election is one of the 
most nontraditional elections of 
all time. If Clinton wants to win in 
November, she must do her best to 
ensure that her entire campaign is 
on the same page and has the same 
goals in mind. Clinton/Perez 2016 
will do just that, and is the best 
team to defeat Trump in November.

Baton Rouge, St. Paul, Staten 

Island and Ferguson. These are 
the names of cities that have 
suffered from extreme police 
brutality. But what about Ann 
Arbor? In the November of 2014, 
Aura Rosser, a 40-year-old Black 
woman, was fatally shot by an 
Ann Arbor police officer when she 
reportedly would not put down 
a knife aimed at the officer. The 
officer involved in the shooting, 
David Ried, was not indicted, 
though 
many 
local 
residents 

criticized the apparent lack of 
transparency of the investigation 
— similar to national speculation 
surrounding 
transparency 
in 

police misconduct cases. Though 
the details of the Rosser shooting 
contain 
far 
fewer 
egregious 

actions on the part of the police 
compared to these other cases, 
lessons can still be learned from 
the judgment of the police.

One of these lessons should be 

that civilians must be involved 
in the response to incidents such 
as this, just as “Campaign Zero” 
recommends. 
In 
March, 
the 

Ann Arbor City Council voted to 
consider a set of recommendations 
put forth by the Ann Arbor 
Human 
Rights 
Commission. 

One of the recommendations 
— to increase civilian oversight 
— has been opposed by Police 
Chief Jim Baird, for the time 
being. One of the Human Rights 
Commission’s recommendations 
was the use of an independent 
auditor to review the Ann Arbor 
Police Department’s policies and 
practices regarding misconduct 
— a process Baird would like 
a report from before enabling 
civillian oversight. As the current 
conversation stands, the civillian 
oversight 
committee 
would 

— independently of the Police 
Department — review complaints 
against police officers. Shooting 

after shooting has proven there 
is no time to wait. While we 
understand the desire to table 
the topic of a civilian oversight 
committee, 
the 
wellbeing 
of 

citizens should be a proactive 
matter, not a reactive one, and 
discussion on how a potential 
oversight 
committee 
would 

function should continue.

Police brutality has happened 

and will continue to happen in 
every city across the nation, 
including our own, until we take 
a stand against violence. Let’s 
have this conversation now, in 
our own town, to ensure these 
tragic shootings do not continue 
to occur in our communities 
in the near or distant future. 
Ensuring 
safety 
and 
justice 

under the law for all citizens 
demands a call to action. Let 
Ann Arbor be the example the 
nation so desperately needs; let’s 
be the change.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS


As 
Americans, 
we 
pride 

ourselves on how far we’ve come 
from the disturbing times of 
slavery and segregation. We view 
stories like the following, which 
occurred in a small Southern 
town during the early 1940s, as 
bestial and archaic, instead of 
recognizing how they directly 
affected the events of today.

As a young man walked past a 

young woman, he was accused of 
piping out a “wolf call” whistle 
in her direction. Though this 
was undoubtedly irksome for 
the woman in question, the 
townsfolk 
responded 
in 
an 

excessively severe manner — for 
the man had the misfortune of 
being born Black in a country 
where white was, and continues 
to be, the more privileged shade.

Word quickly spread through 

the town, and, as a result of the 
growing outrage, the man fled 
north to Philadelphia. However, 
the man’s best friend was later 
found dead behind a 50 gallon 
gas can deep in the woods. The 
killers couldn’t tell, or more 
likely simply didn’t care about, 
the differences between the two.

After arriving in Philadelphia, 

the 
fleeing 
man 
joined 
the 

army to fight for his country 
in the Second World War. He 
died during combat in Italy — 
giving his life for a nation that 
wouldn’t give anything for him.

This man’s story will not be 

found in the pages of a history 
book or in any documentary; 
however, it is present in my 
family’s 
conversations. 
This 

man’s name was Osborne Ellis, 
and he was my grandmother’s 
uncle.

It’s easy to say what happened 

in the past is done and over 
with, but doing so only creates 
room 
for 
gross 
ignorance 

surrounding modern-America’s 
issues with race. All four of 
my grandparents were well 

into adolescence or adulthood 
during, or before, the outbreak 
of the Civil Rights Movement — 
meaning a significant portion 
of their childhood was spent 
in a time and place where 
events like these occurred with 
relative 
frequency. 
Because 

many 
opinions, 
viewpoints 

and habits are formed during 
childhood, my grandparents’ 
generation 
carried 
their 

worldview, which was crafted 
by 
living 
in 
a 
violently 

discriminatory 
society, 
into 

adulthood, shaping how they 
raised the next generation of 
Americans — a generation that 
includes my, and many of my 
peers’, parents.

Like 
clockwork, 
social 

reproduction ensured that my 
parents’ generation imprinted 
upon us the perspectives that 
their parents, who grew up 
in Jim Crow America, taught 
them. Though the past may 
seem distant, we are closer to 
segregation than we’d like to 
imagine.

When people ask why African 

Americans can’t simply forgive 
and forget, they assume we 
have a choice to move on 
from 
the 
decisions 
of 
the 

past — decisions, by the way, 
that were made without the 
consent of African Americans, 
despite the fact that these 
decisions radically influenced 
our 
livelihoods. 
We 
never 

chose 
to 
be 
systematically 

profiled and imprisoned. We 
never chose to be red-lined 
into destitute neighborhoods. 
We never chose to be denied 
opportunities 
based 
on 
the 

pigmentation of our skin. How 
can we “forget” these obstacles 
when they are still restraining 
us in 2016? Asking us to forgive 
and forget implies that we’re 
the ones keeping the legacy of 
segregation alive.

Whenever 
an 
African 

American is senselessly gunned 
down by the police, like we’ve 
seen over the past few days 
with 
Philando 
Castile 
and 

Alton Sterling, I’m angered 
that people still ask, “How 
could this happen in America 
in 2016?” Though most people 
who ask that type of question 
are simply too optimistic about 
the state of race relations in this 
country, failing to acknowledge 
these realities turns a blind eye 
to the deep-rooted racism in 
American culture. 

Until people begin to recognize 

the reality of race relations in 
this country — that segregation 
and oppression have never truly 
disappeared, 
they’ve 
simply 

taken up new names and forms 
— nothing will ever change. The 
deaths of Sterling and Castile are 
not isolated incidents. Their lives 
have just become a number on the 
long list of victims of systematic 
racism in this country.

Until people begin to recognize 

the reality of race relations in 
this country, police brutality will 
continue to plague the African-
American community, employers 
will continue to give white 
applicants preference over their 
Black counterparts and the cycle 
of oppression will remain healthy 
and strong. This is no different 
than what has been happening 
in America since the beginning, 
only now it’s done in more subtle 
ways. Obviously, some progress 
has been made. But in the 
grand scheme of American race 
relations, we’re still living in the 
shadow of the Jim Crow era.

When 
people 
start 
having 

these realizations, maybe we 
will be greeted with compassion 
rather than condemnation. But 
I’m not holding my breath.

Nothing has changed
On race relations

Dear Constituents,
Once again, race and racial 

interactions are front and center 
in our national conversation. Our 
collective thoughts and prayers 
are with the families, loved 
ones, friends and community 
of those lost during the acts of 
violence perpetrated in the week 
that our nation celebrated its 
independence. Alton Sterling, 
Philando Castile, Sgt. Michael 
Smith, Senior Corporal Lorne 
Ahrens, Officer Michael Krol, 
Officer 
Patrick 
Zamarripa 

and Officer Brent Thompson 
represent a growing number of 
Americans who have fallen as a 
result of indiscriminate violence 
and brutality.

Death is neither Black nor 

white. Every life is valuable, and 
each loss of life is a tragedy. It 
is evident, now more than ever, 
that our country must continue 
meaningful 
and 
relevant 

dialogues on race relations, hate, 
fear and healing.

As student leaders we hear you, 

we are grieving with you, and we 
too are struggling to make sense 
of it all. There is nothing that 
could ever be said to rationalize 
the lack of compassion and 
aggression that has plagued our 
country so much this summer 
and for decades. Unfortunately, 
these tensions are not new, 
and they can even pervade our 
campuses. 
They 
stem 
from 

deep-seated 
frustrations 
and 

learned resentments, creating 
a false sense of “us and them.” 
Let us not allow these ideas 
to consume and divide us. Let 
us continue to challenge our 
perceptions, our peers, our 
professors, our administrators 
and our public servants at all 
levels.

How do we overcome? Is it 

possible for us to ever reach 
race equilibrium? 

As students, the exchange 

of 
perspectives, 
ideas 
and 

understanding is critical in 
moving us forward. We need 
to cultivate a campus culture 
that is safe and inclusive of all 
students; one that encourages 
honest, uninhibited dialogue 
on racial issues. We must 
bring these conversations into 
spaces that students occupy, 
whether they be our labs, 
departments, classrooms and 
beyond. It is necessary to 
develop avenues to engage the 
ally and majority community to 
support marginalized groups. 
Don’t be afraid to participate 
in these discussions. Talk to 
one another. Inaction is not an 
option.

Across our campuses, we 

must be more resolved in our 
demand for unity, justice and 
structural equality in all phases 
of 
our 
education. 
Request 

racial literacy training. Enroll 
in culture and race theory 
courses. Explore racial and 
ethnic intolerance subjects. 

We 
are 
grateful 
for 
the 

opportunity 
to 
serve 
our 

graduate 
and 
professional 

student colleagues at each of 
our 
institutions, 
no 
matter 

how difficult the challenge. 
As presidents of the graduate 
governments 
at 
Michigan 

State 
University 
and 
the 

University of Michigan, though 
competitors in the Big Ten, we 
stand united in our resolve to 
empower you to challenge the 
status quo, confront all forms 
of inequity and create the 
best campus environments for 
graduate education in the state 
of Michigan.

TV REVIEW

P4K fest offbeat

By ANAY KATYAL

Summer Senior Arts Editor

This year, Pitchfork celebrates its 

titular festival’s 11th year — arguably 
enough time for it to be considered 
among the sum-
mer’s bonafide 
musical events. 
In its decade-
long existence, 
the festival has 
moved from its 
cheaper, folksy, 
fringer 
roots 

to 
something 

that resembles 
a more main-
stream, 
large-

scale 
fixture 

— 
presumably 

with more of 
a corporate twist thanks to their 
recent takeover by publishing giant 
Condé Nast. Some might fear the 
oft-touted “beacon of musical coun-
terculture” that is Pitchfork may be 
on the verge of selling out to com-
mercialized interests as a result, but 
talking to Pitchfork president Chris 
Kaskie could convince you that the 
publication’s adherence to quality, 
consistency and culture has yet to 
waver.

“Ultimately, our goal is to be both 

a resource and a place to celebrate 
discovery,” Kaskie said. “Whether 
it’s fill in the gaps or expose and 
cover music as it gets noisier year-by-
year, our prerogatives don’t change.”

It’s a credo that has bound Pitch-

fork since its inception 20 years ago, 
and defines the festival and the com-
pany’s other initiatives to this day.

The latest iteration of the festi-

val boasts a typical (and welcome) 
smorgasbord of artists representing 
a wide variety of genres. From ambi-
ent artist Oneohtrix Point Never, to 
contemporary soul musician Blood 
Orange and indie sweetheart Sufjan 
Stevens, the festival deviates a bit 
from what audiences might usually 

expect from a token summer music 
festival. It’s that kind of difference 
that Pitchfork prides itself in.

“I don’t think festivals are some-

thing to be homogenized,” Kaskie 
said. “I think live music is as impor-
tant as ever. I think you can argue 
that discovering is as important as 
ever — and as hard as ever — and I 
think when you create an event that 
is a carbon copy of about, you know, 
an innumerable amount of other 
(festivals), it’s not very inspiring to 
us.”

Though the festival benefits from 

greater financial and corporate sup-
port than previous years, the phi-
losophy and culture seem to remain 
intact.

“(Being) different is what we offer, 

and it really comes down to, you 
know, the prioritization of the music 
over the party and not the other way 
around,” Kaskie said. “We want peo-
ple to walk in and know what Pitch-
fork Festival is [about] regardless of 
whether or not they’re aware of any 
of the bands there.”

With just three stages littered 

across Union Park, all hosting a wide 
range of artists, the festival effec-
tively functions as a vehicle for music 
discovery and appreciation more 
than simply being an opportunity for 
mindless debauchery (at least rela-
tive to its competitors).

As Kaskie put it, “...we try to build 

a program that is reflective of Pitch-
fork readers specifically, and more 
broadly, what we feel music looks 
like.”

The latest iteration of the fest looks 

to be no different, with the expecta-
tion that somewhere around 50,000 
people will overtake Chicago’s Union 
Park this weekend. Despite having 
its fair share of doubters and naysay-
ers, Pitchfork is ready for yet another 
successful summer that embodies 
the publication’s offbeat persona.

Can we trust the man 
behind ‘Mr. Robot’?

Season premiere 
a chaotic look at 

protagonist and world

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily TV/New Media Editor

On 
Sunday, 
USA 
Network 

released the first half of the two-
part “Mr. Robot” season two 
premiere for a 
limited time on 
several 
social 

media 
sites. 

This is a review 
of that half.

There 
are 

few, 
if 
any, 

television 
shows 
with 

the 
kind 
of 

rapport 
“Mr. 

Robot” 
has 

with its viewer. The show’s use of 
an unreliable narrator in the form 
of protagonist Elliot Alderson 
(Rami Malek, “Need For Speed”) 
engenders 
an 
uncertainty 
in 

viewers. However, series creator 
— and now sole director — Sam 
Esmail (“Comet”) didn’t just settle 
for narration, but also actively 
asked us to become a part of 
the series as Elliot’s lone, albeit 
imaginary, 
confidant 
— 
even 

going as far to have Elliot call us 
“friend.” But as the true depth of 
Elliot’s disturbed mental state 
reveals itself, we’re forced to 
reevaluate everything we’ve seen 
and realize we can’t trust Elliot 
because, ultimately, Elliot cannot 
trust himself.

But as Elliot narrates his “loop” 

— the strict daily regimen he 
practices in an attempt to contain 
the chaotic Mr. Robot (Christian 
Slater, “Pump Up the Volume”) 
side of his personality — we’re 
drawn back into our relationship 
with the Elliot that was established 
in the first season. Only when we 
realize Elliot isn’t addressing us, 
but his therapist, Krista (Gloria 
Reuben, “Saints and Sinners”), 
do we recognize things have 
changed between us and Elliot. 
The mistrust we’ve been feeling 
is a two-way street, as Elliot no 
longer fully trusts us with what 
he knows. This shrouds events 

in even more ambiguity, while 
introducing us, the audience, to 
a form of mental voyeurism that 
challenges our complicity in what 
we’re watching. Did Elliot permit 
us to witness his session with 
Krista, or are we peering into 
something that was meant to be 
private?

In a modern world of instant and 

constant connection, loneliness 
pervades throughout “Mr. Robot.” 
The series’ distinct visual style 
frames its characters in off-center 
close-ups, isolating individuals, 
even when they’re in a crowded 
room. Now, we join the cast in 
their solitude as our anchor, Elliot, 
keeps us at arm’s length. The 
first-half of the premiere keeps 
us in the dark and leaves many 
questions partially or completely 
unanswered — what happened to 
Tyrell Wellick, where is the rest 
of fsociety, what side is Whiterose 
on, etc. These lack of conclusions 
force us to look harder, searching 
for answers in places we perhaps 
shouldn’t explore and reaching 
for connections with possibly the 
wrong people.

The series breeds paranoia 

in the first hour by effectively 
removing most elements of trust 
in us and Elliot. Only when we 
look into Elliot’s mind are we 
united 
with 
our 
protagonist 

through uncertainty. Dominated 
by Mr. Robot, Elliot’s mind is 
always at war with itself. Malik 
embodies the vulnerability of 
Elliot, trying to keep on a mask of 
control as what lies underneath 
threatens to break through at any 
moment. On the other side of the 
spectrum is Slater’s Mr. Robot, a 
twisted manifestation of Elliot’s 
deceased father who represents 
the worst things the man can do. 
Precariously kept in check by 
Elliot’s “loop,” Slater plays Mr. 
Robot as a caged animal, snarling 
and lashing against his cage, and 
the bars are bending. All this is 
played out on a battlefield where 
the rules are always changing and 
never certain. Suspense lingers 
whenever Mr. Robot comes into 
the frame and reality is called into 
question.

Meanwhile, many characters 

are caught in the crossfire of 
this mental warfare. Darlene 
(Carly Chaikin, “Suburgatory”) 
desperately continues to wage 
a 
losing 
war 
against 
“Evil” 

Corp, even when Elliot and 
most of society have scattered 
to the winds. Gideon (Michael 
Gill, “House of Cards”), one 
of the few beacons of good in 
the series’ world, finds himself 
under investigation and pleading 
for Elliot to do the right thing 
while Mr. Robot looms in the 
background. As Mr. Robot holds 
a knife to his former employer’s 
neck, we, and Elliot, can only 
hope what we’re seeing isn’t real 
as the knife cuts and blood flows. 
Every scene in “Mr. Robot” has 
the potential to descend into a 
nightmare of madness, leaving the 
viewer to question — which dream 
will come true?

‘Captain Fantastic’ an 
endearing look at life

FILM REVIEW

Sundance film takes a 
look at what it means 

to be a parent

By DANNY HENSEL

Daily Arts Writer

Say what you will about the 

hyper-commercialization of film, 
Marxist cinema is still alive — 
at least in a 
limited 
way, 

living 
as 
it 

would in an 
American 
capitalist 
society: 
on 

the 
fringes. 

In 
“Captain 

Fantastic,” 
a 

family 
that 

ascribes 
to 

these same values also finds itself 
removed, by choice, from the 
grasps of mainstream society, 
settled in rural Washington.

At the head of the Cash family is 

Ben (Viggo Mortensen, “A History 
of Violence”), a man who, with 
his wife, has propped up a remote 
settlement to teach their children 
about life in a way a standardized 
education could not. They exercise 
daily, hunt for their own food and 
read constantly. The Cash family 
has established an intellectual 
utopia 
to 
create 
“philosopher 

kings” of their children — in which 
the word “interesting” is banned — 
anyone who expresses an opinion 
is invited to explain it to open ears 
and celebrations of Christmas 
are left by the wayside in favor of 
Noam Chomsky Day, to honor the 
beloved linguist.

When Ben’s wife dies, the 

dynamics of the family change 
considerably, forced to enter and 
confront 
American 
society 
to 

attend her funeral. This proves 
quite the challenge for the Cashes, 
who pride themselves on their 
intellectual and physical strength. 
As Bodevan (George MacKay, 
“Pride”), the oldest child, cries in 
frustration to his father, “Unless 
it comes out of a book, I don’t 
know 
anything!” 
Bodevan, 
or 

Bodie for short, may be able to 

parse between “Trotskyite” and 
“Trotskyist” 
while 
declaring 

himself as a Maoist, but he is far 
from competent at talking to girls. 
The five other children, whose 
names—Kielyr, 
Vespyr, 
Rellian, 

Zaja and Nai—are meant to signify 
their 
unending 
uniqueness 
in 

the world, also struggle to adapt 
to 
their 
surroundings. 
Only 

Rellian 
(Nicholas 
Hamilton, 

“Strangerland”), 
a 
rebellious 

tween, expresses anger at his 
father for bringing the family out 
to the western wilderness.

“Captain Fantastic” is, above all, 

a master class in emotions, a study 
of how actors can remain human 
even when their characters are far 
from relatable. Individuals who 
live in the forest and are taught to 
hate organized religion, schools, 
medicine — really anything at all — 
are few and far between, yet the six 
children are so believable at their 
core, so dedicated to their father’s 
teachings that it’s impossible not 
to sympathize with them when 
their grandfather threatens to 
take custody. Ben is a complex 
and rather compelling character 
by default, but Mortensen brings a 
dedication and heightened intellect 
to the role that flashes when 
he speaks his rather non-flashy 
dialogue. Frank Langella (“Frost/
Nixon”) plays Ben’s father-in-law 
with gravitas, bringing a quiet yet 
looming and brooding presence to 
the film’s chief antagonist. Kathryn 
Hahn (“The Visit”) and Steve Zahn 
(“Dallas Buyers Club”) blend in 
perfectly as supposedly “good” 
and “responsible” parents who 
have subscribed to the American 
consumerist parenting guide en 
masse that the Cash family so 

despises.

Though, the film can stumble 

when it succumbs to, instead of 
subverting, easy choices. Bodie’s 
cultural blank spots are taken to 
their logical extreme — literally 
being unable to speak to a girl when 
he sees her or, later, proposing to 
wed a girl after meeting her that 
day. He may have only read books, 
but surely they had protagonists 
wait before proposing marriage. 
The symbolism is also a bit too 
pronounced. 
The 
family 
only 

listens to classical music and the 
film dispels with a typical film 
score for something more rustic, 
so, of course, “My Heart Will Go 
On” from “Titanic” blares through 
the speakers in a grocery store. The 
family drives around in a converted 
school bus, painted green and 
retrofitted like an RV, a clear 
allusion to the family’s unorthodox 
translations of what happens in a 
typical American household and 
life.

Yet, ultimately, the film is a 

success because it’s unafraid to 
explore and often defend the 
family’s 
experimental 
living. 

Writer and Director Matt Ross 
(“28 Hotel Rooms”) clearly did his 
research, diving into the worlds of 
Noam Chomsky and the Slovenian 
philosopher Slavoj Zizek, whose 
theory of over-identification as a 
strategy to upend societal norms 
clearly 
informed 
the 
family’s 

method of scaring cops away from 
arresting Ben. The line is repeated 
continuously throughout, but it’s 
ultimately true: “We’re defined 
by our actions, not our words.” 
We may criticize our society to 
no end, but Ross has actually 
shown us what we could be.

‘Night Of’ dread 
and misfortune

By ALEX INTNER

Summer Managing Arts Editor

If you look at HBO’s drama 

offerings beyond the massive 
hit that is “Game of Thrones,” 
you’ll find a 
pretty 
bar-

ren 
cabinet. 

While 
“The 

Leftovers” 
has 
criti-

cal 
acclaim, 

it’s 
ratings 

are not near-
ly 
strong 

enough 
to 

anchor 
any-

thing on its own. The upcom-
ing “Westworld” has been in a 
tumultuous 
development 
and 

production cycle for years now — 
either a sign of creative turmoil 
or a struggle to find what they 
want the show to be. And, most 
embarrassingly, HBO rolled back 
its season two renewal of “Vinyl” 
after realizing the massive cre-
ative revamp the drama would 
need wasn’t worth their resourc-
es. So, this year, they were forced 
to give their summer drama slot 
to a smaller miniseries that has 
also been in development for a 
while (originally intended to be a 
vehicle for the late, great James 
Gandolfini, “The Sopranos”, who 
retains a posthumous executive 
producer credit), a show that 
wouldn’t usually be thought of 
as a network anchor. The move 
seems to have paid off from a 
business perspective, as the 
drama premiered to significantly 
higher ratings than last year’s 
“Show Me a Hero.” Creatively 
speaking, “The Night Of” is 
HBO’s best series premiere since 
“Hero,” as its slow build of a story 
hooks you in a slow and painful 
manner.

“The Night Of” ’s premiere 

follows a night gone horribly 
wrong. While Nasir (Riz Ahmed, 
“Nightcrawler”) is on the way to 
a party in his father’s cab, Andrea 
(Sofia Black D’Elia, MTV’s adap-
tation of “Skins”) gets in. She 
leads him on an adventure across 
town before bringing him home 
for an evening of drugs and sex. 
However, when he wakes up in 
the kitchen, he walks over to 

the bedroom to find her brutally 
stabbed to death and blood every-
where. He runs, but is caught by 
the police for an unrelated crime. 
Brought to the station, the police 
find the murder weapon on his 
body and proceeds to question 
him about the crime (which he 
has no memory of), at least until 
lawyer Jack Stone (John Turtur-
ro, “The Big Lebowski”, in a role 
originally planned for Gandol-
fini) shows up and starts to help 
Nasir.

The episode unfolds this story 

methodically across its hour-
plus runtime. It takes nearly a 
half-hour for Nasir’s full encoun-
ter with Andrea to play out. As 
it continues, the sense of dread 
builds. The show is completely 
aware you know something bad 
is going to happen to them, and it 
uses that to build a palpable sense 
of tension. As Nasir gets arrested 
for a completely different act, you 
know they’re going to figure out 
he was at the scene of the mur-
der (in fact, the cops who arrest 
him are called to the scene while 
he’s in the car and bring him to 
sit in the car outside of the build-
ing he just left). It plays with your 
knowledge of what happened 
and made me physically uncom-
fortable in the best way possible.

By the end of the first episode, 

we have no idea where this story 
is going. Heck, we don’t even 
know if this is a case of mistaken 
identity or if Nasir committed the 
murder when his memory falters. 
In this case, we’re as in the dark 
as the main character, and it’s 
going to be exciting to see how 
the series deliberately unravels 
its story. While a single minise-
ries is not enough to come close 
to securing HBO’s drama future, 
“The Night Of” gives hope that 
the pipeline might not be as bar-
ren as reported.

combating the pollution.

When 
asked 
whether 
he 

would like nonpartisan elections 
and increased term limits for 
City 
Council, 
Leaf 
said 
he 

favors 
nonpartisan 
November 

elections because two elections 
— the primary in August and the 
general in November — puts an 
unnecessary burden on voters, 
citing the 6 percent turnout for 
Ward 1 in the last election. He 
also said that maintaining the 
two-year term limit allows for 
more pools of candidates.

“Often we have incumbents 

unopposed right now, and I think 
we want to have a broad enough 
base of candidates that we have 
options,” Leaf said. “And if you 
make the requirements up to four 
years, I think you’re going to cut 
the number of people who are 
perfectly competent but aren’t 
ready for a four-year term.”

Frenzel 
agreed 
on 

implementing 
nonpartisan 

elections, adding that it can 
increase student voter turnout. 
However, he said he prefers four-
year terms because it allows 
councilmembers 
to 
mature 

throughout their terms.

In 
his 
closing 
statement, 

Frenzel touted environmental 
ethics for Ann Arbor residents.

“As we see our tax base 

increasing at this point, we 
need to honor the ethic of Ann 
Arborites, the true understanding 
of who we believe we are,” 
Frenzel said. “And, to me, that 
means reinstating and promoting 
our green organizations to make 
sure we’re pushing forward our 
environmental ethic, which has 
in many metrics stagnated.”

Leaf continued optimistically, 

saying that there is a solution for 
everything in Ann Arbor and that 
only strong leadership in City 
Council as a whole can allow for 
that.

“Whether your problem is that 

people are speeding in front of 
your house, or you worry more 
about much bigger timescale 
problems 
… 
whatever 
your 

problem is, there’s a very good 
chance we can fix it,” Leaf said. 
“We can get it done.”

Kailasapathy closed by listing 

her many accomplishments as an 
incumbent and her plans for the 
future.

“I have worked with multiple 

groups dealing with cut-through 
commuter 
traffic, 
excessive 

street parking and such issues,” 

Kailasapathy said. “And I will 
continue to support these types 
of efforts where residents’ safety 
and quality of life are being 
affected.”

Ward 4

Ward 4 candidates Eric Lipson 

(D), Diane Giannola (D) and 
incumbent Graydon Krapohl (D) 
fielded questions on Tuesday in 
a forum hosted by the League of 
Women Voters concerning issues 
including balancing the budget, 
proposals that would change City 
Council elections from partisan 
to nonpartisan voting as well as 
change terms from two to four 
years in length, the dioxane 
plume and council transparency.

The 
three 
candidates 

expressed polar views on certain 
topics, especially on the issue of 
a proposed train station project. 
The primary points of concern 
were the issue of City Council 
transparency and the simpler 
question 
of 
station 
building 

location. 

Lipson voiced objections to 

the redaction of information 
regarding 
communications 

between the Federal Railway 
Administration and city staff 
about station location. Lipson 
brought with him to the forum a 
document that showed near total 
redaction, using it as an example 
to describe the current state of 
City Council transparency as 
deeply flawed. 

“It is deeply disturbing to 

myself and many other citizens,” 
he said, holding the document up 
on display. “I would like to believe 
that a more open and inclusive 
government is the way that the 
city of Ann Arbor would like to 
see its government go. I am very 
concerned — there is a culture of 
secrecy which is being fostered 
and encouraged by the current 
council.”

Giannola voiced a more neutral 

position on the issue, saying 
that she would opt to ask more 
questions rather than insist on 
release of information.

Krapohl took the opposite 

stance of Lipson and was also one 
of the six council members who 
had voted against releasing the 
information to the public, saying 
there is still information from the 
federal agency for which the city 
government is waiting. 

“I didn’t support at this time 

releasing the information because 
I don’t feel that there is enough 
there for the public to make an 
informed decision,” he said.

Study shows marijuana affects 
user’s pleasure-related cognition

RESEARCH

Drug users feel less 
pleasure to monetary 
rewards compared to 

non-users

By MADELEINE GERSON

Daily Staff Reporter

According to a recent study 

conducted 
by 
University 
of 

Michigan researchers, long-term 
marijuana usage is associated with 
a decrease in the brain’s response 
time. The study, published in 
JAMA Psychiatry medical journal, 
brought forth new information 
about the effect marijuana can 
have on the brain of a young adult 
user.

Marijuana’s reputation as both a 

risky gateway drug and a harmless 
substance with medical benefits is 
a major component in the current 
legislation discussion surrounding 
its 
legalization. 
Currently, 

recreational marijuana is legal in 
four states — Alaska, Colorado, 
Oregon and Washington — and 
Washington, D.C., and medical 
marijuana is legal in 20 states.

According to an article in the 

Los Angeles Times, California will 
vote this November on whether to 
legalize recreational marijuana. 
 

In Michigan, medical marijuana is 
legal and marijuana possession has 
been decriminalized by a total of 14 
cities since November 2014.

The majority of studies on long-

term marijuana usage have been 

associative and limited due to 
the fact that correlation does not 
imply causation. Mary Heitzeg, a 
University assistant professor of 
psychiatry and the senior author 
of the study, said her team’s study 
is the first longitudinal study 
about marijuana usage that is not 
refutable.

“Our study is unique in that we 

actually look at brain activation 
measures over time as opposed to 
cross-sectional studies looking at 
marijuana users and non-users,” 
Heitzeg 
said. 
“Those 
studies 

cannot 
necessarily 
disentangle 

cause and effect.”

The 
participants 
— 
108 

marijuana users in their early 20s 
— were asked to play a game while 
their brains were being scanned in 
a functional magnetic resonance 
imaging scanner. In each round, the 
players were informed they could 
either win money for winning the 
round or no money was at stake.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter 

that affects the feeling of pleasure 
and 
pleasure-related 
cognition, 

and 
when 
people 
engage 
in 

rewarding 
behavior, 
levels 
of 

dopamine increase in the reward 
centers of the brain — the nucleus 
accumbens. 

The 
neuroimaging 
showed 

that, in participants who reported 
higher usage of marijuana, less 
dopamine was released. This means 
marijuana users felt less pleasure in 
response to the monetary rewards 
presented throughout the game 
compared to non-users.

On 
the 
contrary, 
when 

researchers looked at the same 
participants’ responses to the 
reward of drug anticipation, there 
was a higher amount of dopamine 
in the nucleus accumbens — which 
could be a sign of addiction.

Heitzeg explained that this 

could occur when a drug “hijacks” 
the user’s reward system, referring 
to when a user becomes dependent 
on a drug to experience the feeling 
of reward.

“This means that something 

that would be rewarding to most 
people was no longer rewarding 
to them,” Heitzeg said. “This 
suggests but not proves that their 
reward system has been ‘hijacked’ 
by the drug, and that they need 
the drug to feel reward — or that 
their emotional response has been 
dampened.”

The work of Heitzeg’s team has 

led to the rise of potential future 
research 
questions. 
Rackham 

student 
Meghan 
Martz, 
the 

primary author of the study, 
said 
non-drug-related 
rewards 

other than money could produce 
comparable outcomes.

“This task happens to use 

monetary incentives, but there are 
a number of other non-drug related 
rewards that could also be tested, 
such as food,” Martz said.

Martz added that the study is 

relevant in today’s politics since 
marijuana usage is increasing at 
a high rate, which may lead to a 
belief that the drug does not pose 
any severe consequences to health.

“The legalization of marijuana 

See MARIJUANA, Page 10

Marchers were eager to get more 

people involved, encouraging many 
bystanders to join the protest. Many 
passing-by cars honked in support 
of the protesters, and some drivers 
got out of their vehicles to record 
the protest.

Most bystanders either joined in 

the chants or observed in silence, 
but one woman, in response to 
the chants of “Black lives matter!” 
replied with: “All lives matter!”

The climate between protesters 

and police during the protest was 
friendly, with several protesters 
shaking the hands of police officers 
and speakers calling for the crowd 
to thank the police department. 
However, protest organizer Diante 
Harris, a Kinesiology junior, said 
the department still has work to 
do build relationships with the 
community.

Harris further argued that the 

need for increased civilian oversight 
doesnt necessarily imply the police 
department has been neglecting its 
responsibilities, adding that local 
officers should have nothing to fear. 

“The chief is probably just 

thinking that this is all out of spite, 
or, you know, a quick reaction, but 
as people who pay these officers 
to protect and serve them, and 
as people that are a part of the 
communities that these officers 
work in, I don’t see what bad could 
come out of having a say in some 
of the matters,” Harris said. “Right 
now the police chief doesn’t want to 
hear that in Ann Arbor. He believes 
that this is a local problem, and that 
everyone is overreacting because of 
what happened to Aura (Rosser),” 
he continued, to boos from the 
crowd. 

In front of a crowd of hundreds 

gathered on the Diag, Kinesiology 
senior Nas Ali lamented the death 
of Philando Castile, who was killed 
on the same street Ali lived on as a 
child, where his family still lives.

“Last week, when Philando 

Castile passed away –– I live here, I 
go to school here, but that happened 
half a block from where I grew up,” 
Ali said. “The cop who killed him 
has pulled me over so many times, 
and I can’t even put into words 
the things that he has said to me. 
This time it changed. As much as 
I’ve grieved for everyone who has 
happened before, this time I wasn’t 
removed from it. It wasn’t St. Louis. 
It wasn’t Florida. It was in my 
backyard.”

Harris 
also 
spoke 
to 
the 

experiences he’d had with police.

“Growing up, I only saw them 

when someone in my community 
was being arrested,” Harris said. 
“What do you think that does to you 
when you’re a kid, to your psyche? 
You’re going to not trust the police. 
You’re going to be afraid of the 
police.”

Despite the distrust he described, 

Harris ended by encouraging unity.

“We need more community 

involvement 
with 
our 
police 

officers,” he said. “And that’s the 
truth — I know not everyone wants 
to hear that. A lot of people don’t 
want any unity between the police 
officers and the community, but 
they are part of the communities 
whether we like it or not. And we 
are part of the communities that 
they serve, whether we like it or 
not.”

Protester 
Johnny 
Anderson 

challenged 
stereotypes 
of 

protesters, saying their message 
wasn’t so unpalatable as some 
believed and that demonstrators 
like himself don’t condone violence.

“Everybody has this vision in 

their head, that the revolution’s 
going to be this violent gunfire 
against the government,” Anderson 
said. “No, it’s going to be peace, it’s 
going to be this right here. This is 
the revolution right here. CNN ain’t 
coming here to see this peace, ain’t 
nothing to talk about.”

Ann Arbor resident Brionne 

Fonville said that the revolution 
would require more than protesting 
and marching.

“What I saw here tonight was 

beautiful,” Fonville said. “There’s so 
much power and potential in what 
we did, marching. But we need to 
start thinking about what we’re 
going to do next. You all have the 
same equal power and potential. 
I’m going to paraphrase Dr. King 
for a second, and all I want to say is 
think about what you’re doing with 
your life. Think about what you do 
every day. Think about the people 
you come into contact with and 
think about how you can use that to 
bend the moral arc towards justice.”

AAPD 
Officer 
Thomas 

Hickey, while also encouraging 
communication 
between 
police 

and civilians, argued the AAPD has 
done much to engage its community.

“I can tell you that at the Ann 

Arbor Police Department, we have 
been proactive about diversity and 
multicultural training,” Hickey said. 
“We probably go above the standard 
for training. We pride ourselves on 
staying current with what’s going 
on, and that makes for a better 
police department, and probably 
overall transparent. We have great 
communication with some of the 
folks 
here. 
Communication 
is 

basically the bottom line.”

Vigil held to recognize lost lives from attacks in Iraq

CAMPUS LIFE

Attendees state 

frequency of Islamic 
State attacks does 
not lessen tragedy

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Daily Staff Reporter

More than 100 students and 

community members attended 
a vigil Friday night on the Diag 
to mourn the losses of the more 
than 290 people killed in the July 
3 bombing of a shopping center in 
Baghdad, Iraq’s capital city. Many 
of the people at the shopping 
center were shopping for Eid 
al-Fitr, a major Muslim holiday 
and the conclusion to a month of 
fasting.

The explosion was the deadliest 

in 
Baghdad 
since 
2003, 
but 

it follows a growing trend of 
violence in Iraq. Since January 
2014, the Iraqi Civil War between 
the Islamic State and the Iraqi 
government has taken the lives of 
more than 45,000Iraqi civilians.

The Islamic State claimed 

responsibility 
for 
the 
recent 

attack and said it was motivated by 
religious differences, according 
to the group’s statement. Karada, 
the district of Baghdad effected 
by the bombing, is made up of 
mostly Shia Muslims, a sect 
which the Islamic State labels 
as heretics. The Islamic State is 
composed of Sunni, a separate 
sect of Islam.

Speakers at the vigil, however, 

said the polarization of the Sunni 
and Shia communities portrayed 
in the coverage of the attacks 
was inaccurate and politically 

motivated.

“I’ve noticed from the names 

there are Shia Muslims, Sunni 
Muslims, 
Kurds, 
Turkmen, 

much of the Chaldean Christian 
community,” Mehmed Yaqubi, 
an Iraqi refugee and recent U.S. 
citizen, said as he read a list 
of names of the victims of the 
bombing. “It was disheartening 
to say the least.”

Attendees 
of 
the 
vigil 

expressed displeasure over the 
disparity 
in 
media 
coverage 

between the Karada attack and 
others also perpetrated by the 
Islamic 
State. 
Following 
the 

November 2015 attacks in Paris, 
there was an explosion of people 
taking to social media to express 
their sympathies, overlaying the 
French flag on their Facebook profile 
pictures, 
largely 
overshadowing 

the reaction to the bombings that 

occurred in Beirut earlier that day.

LSA alum Banen Al-Sheemary, 

who organized the vigil, said one 
of its purposes was to give victims 
of the attack the recognition they 
deserved but had not yet received.

“I think it was important to 

organize this vigil to, one: raise 
awareness, but also talk about the 
double standard that, when these 
type of things happen, when brown 
or Black bodies are the ones being 
killed in such violent ways, that 
they’re not recognized by the 
media,” Al-Sheemary said. “So, 
I didn’t hear anything from any 
type of media source for the most 
part about this attack. To have 
nearly 300 people, the total is 
now –– I don’t like speaking in 
numbers, but almost 300 people 
died in that way, and just to 
not be recognized is just a very 
inhumane response. I think it’s 

unacceptable that the world isn’t 
saying anything. The world isn’t 
showing their support for the 
Iraqi people.”

Al-Sheemary 
pointed 
out 

that there was another bombing 
just the night before in Balad, 
Iraq, which took the lives of at 
least 40 more, and for which 
the Islamic State again claimed 
responsibility.

Participants at the vigil stated 

that the frequency of the violence 
does not lessen the tragedy, and 
speakers encouraged attendees 
not to become desensitized to the 
loss of human life.

“Iraqis are human too, and 

we still suffer regardless of how 
many times we are attacked,” 
LSA senior Asma Ali, who has 
lost several family members to 
similar occurrences of violence in 
Iraq, said.

“I couldn’t get the voice of the 

4-year-old out of my head,” Elias 
said. “I can’t be okay with the fact 
another generation is experiencing 
these things because this colors 
(the child’s) world. She won’t grow 

up ever feeling safe again.”

Elias 
added 
that 
she 
felt 

frustrated during the vigil because 
people who should be at the vigil, 
such as people who are not aware 

of the current events or are against 
the Black Lives Matter movement, 
were not present.

“I have been to many events like 

this, and, even more powerfully 

this time, I thought the wrong 
people are at this event,” Elias 
said. “The people who need to be 
here are not. And I need to know, 
as an ally, as a human and as an 
advocate, what the next step is. 
How do we get people who are 
not our allies here?”

On the same night, snipers 

opened fire at a Black Lives 
Matter protest in Dallas, where 
a primary suspect was believed 
to have frustrations with police 
brutality and the Black Lives 
Matter movement. The snipers 
are believed to have targeted 
white people, specifically white 
police officers, and fatally injured 
five 
officers 
after 
shooting 

twelve.

The shooting has sparked 

national conversations about the 
Black Lives Matter movement 

and has drawn further attention to 
the victims of police brutality, such 
as Sterling and Castile.

At the vigil, a petition calling 

for civilian oversight of police 
was circulated. Miller said the 
organizers 
were 
motivated 
to 

start this petition because it is 
dangerous for one group to have 
control of the justice system.

“The justice system should not 

(be) placed in just one group’s 
hands,” Miller said. “We hope more 
can be done (with the overseeing 
group).”

Miller 
added 
that 
different 

groups 
would 
need 
to 
come 

together in solidarity to make such 
changes.

“The recent killings started 

getting a lot of publicity and now 
everybody’s getting on board,” 
Miller said. “We need more people 
onboard — we need police officers 
on board, we need Congress on 
board, we need the president after 
Obama to be on board … it can’t just 
stop here.”

is a widely debated issue in our 
society,” Martz said. “Marijuana 
is the most commonly used illicit 
drug in the U.S., and perception of 
harm is decreasing.”

Martz said the research about 

long-term marijuana usage and 

response to rewards will add to 
the discussion about marijuana 
legalization and may or may not 
have the potential to modify the 
public perception of the drug.

“Our study does not necessarily 

show that marijuana is good or 
bad,” Martz said. “Instead, it 
provides evidence that, over time, 
marijuana use may impact the way 
the brain responds to reward.”

Famed sports agent Leigh Steinberg hosting event 
at Michigan, talks Harbaugh: “Jim is an original” 

By ORION SANG 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Leigh Steinberg has had quite 

the career.

The famed sports agent has 

represented eight No. 1 overall NFL 
Draft picks, more than 60 NFL first 
round picks and countless other 
professional athletes across sports 
such as basketball, baseball and 
hockey, among others.

At his peak, he was the most 

visible 
sports 
agent 
in 
the 

business, credited with helping 
to 
revolutionize 
the 
field 
of 

sports agency and serving as the 
inspiration behind the hit 1996 
film ‘Jerry Maguire’ — in which 
Steinberg was portrayed by Tom 
Cruise.

At his lows, Steinberg was 

an agent without any clients, 
struggling with 
alcohol abuse.

Now, in his 

seventh 
year 

of sobriety and 
three 
years 

removed 
from 

receiving 
funding 
to 
restart 

his 
agency, 

Steinberg 
has 

rebuilt 
his 

career at Steinberg Sports and 
Entertainment, which currently 
represents 10 clients, including 
rookie quarterback Paxton Lynch 
— a first round draft choice of the 
Denver Broncos.

Steinberg has also continued to 

work on other ventures outside of 
client 
representation, 
including 

projects on anti-bullying initiatives 
and concussion awareness, along 
with a book and film and television 
consultation.

Though Steinberg says he has 

spoken at colleges throughout 
his more than four decade-long 
career — about his profession and 
its main tenets — he has opted for 
a new, additional approach over the 
past couple of years, one that he 
admits is more rewarding: “Leigh 
Steinberg’s Agent Academy.”

“I’m deluged with requests and 

queries and resumes from people 
wanting to get into the sports 
industry,” Steinberg said in an 
interview with The Daily. “They 

come in by the thousands. If you 
were to go to college campuses — 
and I’ve spoken on more than 80 
campuses — you 
would find that 
the 
number 

one career path 
involves sports. 
Yet no one gives 
a 
practical 

education 
that 

helps 
someone 

with the core 
skills that they 
need 
to 
be 

effective.

“So we were looking to try and 

see if we could be helpful to a new 
generation of sports agents and 
professionals who have ethics, 
values and ideals and truly are 
going to bring energy and passion 
to sports and to train them the right 

way.”

A 
one-day 

educational 
seminar on the 
field of sports 
agentry, 
the 

Agent Academy 
dives 
into 

everything 
Steinberg 
believes an agent 
must learn and 
master.

For 
instance, 
he 
puts 
his 

students 
through 
a 
recruiting 

exercise where they must practice 
recruiting an athlete and the 
athlete’s parents. Other exercises 
focus on negotiation techniques, 
marketing and branding through 
social 
media. 
There’s 
even 
a 

segment that teaches participants 
how to deal with a situation in 
which their client has gotten in 
some sort of trouble.

“It’s fun and I think the 

participants get a great one-
day education and everything 
you need to know about how to 
be successful,” Steinberg said. 
“Hopefully we’re bringing value 
and jumpstarting a whole new 
generation.”

Perhaps the most crucial part of 

Steinberg’s approach as an agent 
and teacher is his emphasis on 
using athletes to create change.

“My dad had two core values,” 

Steinberg 
said. 
“One 
was 
to 

treasure relationships, especially 

with family, and the second was to 
try to make a meaningful difference 
in the world and help people who 

couldn’t 
help 

themselves. 
I 

found that in this 
field, 
because 

of the power of 
celebrity 
status 

for athletes, that 
they can really 
trigger imitative 
behavior.

“One 
of 

the 
core 

philosophies that 

I’ve had since 1975 is the athlete as a 
role model. Going back and setting 
up a high school scholarship, a 
foundation at the professional level, 
all of which lay a foundation for the 
player’s second career.”

The 
next 
academy 
takes 

place July 16 at the University 
of Michigan — an institution 
Steinberg has many ties to.

His 
first 
first-rounder 
from 

the school was John Anderson, a 

linebacker drafted by the Green 
Bay Packers in 1978. Then, he went 
on to represent Jim Harbaugh, who 
was taken in the first round by the 
Chicago Bears in 1987, Desmond 
Howard and Amani Toomer.

Steinberg has also spoke before 

at both the business and law 
schools at Michigan, experiences 
that influenced his decision to hold 
an academy in Ann Arbor.

He also has the added benefit 

of being able 
to 
visit 
his 

friend 
and 

former 
client, 

Harbaugh, 
while in town.

“Jim is an 

original,” 
Steinberg said. 
“You have to 
start with the 
fact that he’s 
really bright and intellectually 
curious. He loves to learn, loves 
to delve into a whole variety of 
issues. Jim could talk politics, 

economics, culture, a whole series 
of things. He’s got a killer sense of 
humor (and) I’ve always found him 
to be really warm. He was a great 
team player with competitive fire 
and resilience. One day he called 
the Jim Rome Show and got in 
the Smack-Off, which very few 
professional athletes do.

“There was no question he 

was going to transform Michigan 
because you take every part of what 

being a head coach 
is 
comprised 

of 
— 
he’s 
a 

devastatingly good 
recruiter, he can 
listen and adjust 
and never gives 
up. He can speak 
well to the public, 
alums like him, 
(and) he’s got so 
much toughness in 

him that it will elevate every player’s 
performance. So it’s no big surprise 
that he’s been a success everywhere 
he has gone.”

FOOTBALL

“I think the 

participants get 
a great one-day 

education.”

The seminar 

emphasizes the 
off-field impact 
of the athlete.

Steinberg was 

Harbaugh’s 

agent when he 
was drafted.

Wolverines earn preseason honors

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Senior defensive back Jourdan Lewis was a semi-finalist for the Jim Thorpe award last season. 

By ETHAN WOLFE

Summer Managing Sports Editor

In its first year under head 

coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh, 
the 

Michigan football team finished 
10-3 — capped with a 41-7 
blowout victory over Florida in 
the Citrus Bowl — to ride a wave 
of momentum and hype into the 
offseason.

That wave has only continued, 

as the National College Football 
Awards 
Association 
recently 

named 
seven 
Wolverines 
to 

preseason watch lists.

Senior defensive back Jourdan 

Lewis and redshirt sophomore 
linebacker Jabrill Peppers each 
found their name on three watch 
lists.

Lewis, 
who 
had 
20 
pass 

deflections and two interceptions 
last season, was put on the watch 
list for the Bronko Nagurski, 
Chuck Bednarik and Jim Thorpe 
awards, in which he was a semi-
finalist last season. The Nagurski 
and Bednarik awards are decided 
by different organizations but 
are both given to the nation’s 
best defensive player, while the 
Thorpe award is given to the 
nation’s best defensive back. 
Charles Woodson is the only 
Wolverine to have won all three 
honors.

A finalist for the Paul Hornung 

Award last season — presented to 
the nation’s most versatile player 
— Peppers found his name on 
this year’s watch list. Peppers 
was also placed on the watch list 
for the Nagurski and Bednarik 
awards. Peppers burst onto the 

scene last season as a play-maker 
on both sides of the ball after 
missing most of his freshman 
year due to injury. The redshirt 
sophomore returned kicks and 
punts for the Wolverines while 
also playing a prominent role in 
the defensive secondary, tallying 
5.5 tackles for loss and 10 pass 
deflections. Under new defensive 
coordinator Don Brown, Peppers 
will be a linebacker.

Senior 
defensive 
end 

Chris 
Wormley 
is 
the 
lone 

representative from Michigan’s 
D-line. 
The 
returning 
team 

leader in sacks and tackles 
for loss with 6.5 and 14.5, 
respectively, Wormley reached 
the watch lists of the Bednarik 
and 
Nagurski 
awards 
after 

starting all 13 games last season 
and earning All-Big Ten third 
team honors.

On the other side of the ball, 

junior center Mason Cole and 
senior tackle Erik Magnuson 
were both selected to the watch 
list for the Outland Trophy, 
which is given to the nation’s 
best interior offensive lineman. 
Cole — who switched positions 
from left tackle to center in the 
offseason — was also named in 
consideration for the Rimington 
Trophy, awarded to the top 
center in college football. Cole 
and 
Magnuson 
were 
both 

steady presences on the line for 
Michigan last year, each starting 
all 13 games and earning spots on 
All-Big Ten teams in 2015.

Another 
Wolverine 
who 

has 
received 
considerable 

attention 
in 
the 
preseason 

is senior wide receiver Jehu 
Chesson. Chesson was named 
as the No. 2 wide receiver to 
watch in 2016 according to 
Lance 
Zierlein 
of 
NFL.com. 

Chesson tallied 50 catches for 
764 yards and nine touchdowns 
and capped off his season with 
five catches for 118 yards and 
a 
touchdown 
in 
the 
Citrus 

Bowl. Chesson, who also scored 
two rushing touchdowns and 
another off a kick return against 
Northwestern, warranted a first 
team All-Big Ten selection in 
2015. Now entering his final 
season, Chesson has been placed 
on the watch list for both the 
Maxwell and Fred Biletnikoff 
awards. The awards are given 
to the nation’s best offensive 
player and wide receiver in 
college 
football, 
respectively. 

The only Wolverines to have 
won the Maxwell Award were 
Tom 
Harmon 
in 
1940 
and 

Desmond Howard in 1991, while 
Braylon Edwards took home the 
Biletnikoff award in 2004.

The final Wolverine to earn 

preseason accolades was senior 
tight end Jake Butt, who was 
placed on the preseason watch 
list for the Maxwell Award and 
the John Mackey Award, given 
to the best tight end in college 
football. Butt was a semi-finalist 
for the latter in 2015, in which 
he collected 51 catches for 654 
yards and three touchdowns. 
Though Arkansas’ Hunter Henry 
edged Butt for the award, Butt 
was still honored as a first team 
All-American and the Big Ten 
Tight End of the Year.

‘M’-Notre Dame set to 

renew rivalry in 2018

Michigan canceled its 
series with Arkansas 
to make room for the 

matchup

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

One of college football’s most 

storied rivalries is due for a 
return after a three year hiatus.

Thursday, 
the 
Michigan 

Athletic Department announced 
that the Michigan football team 
will resume its series against 
Notre Dame in 2018 and 2019. 
The Wolverines will first travel 
to South Bend before hosting 
the Fighting Irish the following 
year.

Both 
games 
will 
replace 

Michigan’s 
two 
scheduled 

meetings with Arkansas, with 
Michigan reportedly paying a $2 
million buyout 
to replace the 
Razorbacks, 
according 
to 

Ryan Krasnoo 
at SINow.

Michigan 

will face Notre 
Dame on Sept. 
1, 
2018. 
The 

Wolverines 
will then host the Fighting Irish 
on Oct. 26, 2019 — moving that 
year’s matchup with Rutgers to 
Sept. 28 instead.

“This is a game that holds 

great 
significance 
for 
the 

student-athletes 
and 
coaches 

who compete on the field,” said 
Michigan 
Athletic 
Director 

Warde Manuel in a statement 
released Thursday. “A great deal 
of credit goes to Coach Harbaugh 
and Coach Kelly for initiating 
the discussion of scheduling 
this series. This rivalry is also 
important for the fans of both 
programs, and we look forward 
to renewing one of college 
football’s great rivalries.”

Added Michigan head coach 

Jim Harbaugh: “The competition 
between Michigan and Notre 
Dame has created a fair, healthy 
and 
productive 
rivalry 
over 

time, and it brings out the best in 
both programs. We look forward 
to facing Coach Brian Kelly and 

the Irish in the coming years.”

The Wolverines and Fighting 

Irish have met 41 times since 
the first meeting between the 
two schools took place in 1897 
in what was Notre Dame’s first 
football game.

Since then, both teams have 

jockeyed for a position atop 
college football. Michigan and 
Notre Dame rank No. 1 and No. 
3, respectively, in all-time wins, 
and No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, 
in all-time winning percentage.

Michigan leads the all-time 

series with a record of 24-17-1, 
while the last 10 games between 
the two have been almost evenly 
split — the Wolverines hold a 
slight 6-4 advantage.

In 2011, the two teams played 

in the first ever night game at 
the Big House and set the NCAA 
single-game attendance record. 
Michigan emerged with a 35-31 
victory after a late touchdown 

pass 
from 

Denard 
Robinson 
to 

Roy Roundtree.

The 
two 

met 
once 

more 
under 

the 
lights 
in 

2013, when the 
Wolverines 
took 
home 
a 

41-30 victory in a game that 
broke 
the 
2011 
attendance 

record with 115,109 people in the 
stands.

But despite the history and 

popularity of the rivalry, the 
series was ended for a brief 
period of time. In 2012, Notre 
Dame athletic director Jack 
Swarbrick announced that the 
school would be ending the 
rivalry after the 2014 season.

Shortly 
thereafter, 
former 

Michigan head coach Brady 
Hoke said that the Fighting Irish 
were “chickening out” of the 
rivalry.

Notre Dame, though, had the 

last laugh with a 31-0 drubbing 
of the Wolverines at South Bend 
in 2014, the last game before the 
short break.

Manuel also stated that there 

are ongoing negotiations with 
Notre Dame over extending the 
series past the two currently 
scheduled meetings.

FOOTBALL

“It brings out 
the best in both 

programs.”
