The Ford School of Public 
Policy at the University of 
Michigan 
hosted 
a 
panel 
featuring leading figures in 
current 
electoral 
reform, 
bringing together nearly 100 
students 
and 
community 
members for a discussion 
on the future of Michigan’s 
electoral system and midterm 
proposals on Monday. 
The 
event 
consisted 
of 
several panelists organized 
to discuss the costs and 

benefits of two specific ballot 
initiatives to be voted on in 
less than a month on Nov. 6. 
Proposal 2 would establish 
an independent redistricting 
commission to replace the 
current process of drawing 
district lines. Proposal 3, 
otherwise known as “Promote 
the Vote,” would make several 
changes 
to 
the 
Michigan 
Constitution, 
incorporating 
practices such as straight-
ticket voting, automatic and 
same-day voter registration 
and unconditional absentee 
voting for Michigan residents 
overseas.

According 
to 
John 
Chamberlin, 
professor 
emeritus of Public Policy, 
the moderator of the event, 
each initiative would greatly 
reform the electoral system 
of the state of Michigan, 
allowing for greater citizen 
efficacy and minimizing the 
possibility of partisan activity 
in the redistricting process.
Panelist Sharon Dolente, 
a voting rights strategist for 
the American Civil Liberties 
Union 
of 
Michigan, 
was 
adamant in her support for

MATT VAILLIENCOURT/Daily
Sharon Dolente, voting rights strategist of the ACLU of Michigan, discusses electoral reforms that are on the 
Michigan general election ballot during a panel lecture at the Ford School Monday afternoon. 

Columbus Day, a holiday 
previously 
commemorated 
across the United States that 
is now partially replaced by 
Indigenous 
Peoples’ 
Day, 
marks 
for 
many 
on 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
campus and across the country 
a time to consider historical 

and 
current 
treatment 
of 
Native American communities.
Earlier on Monday, students 
hung a banner in the Diag which 
read “Stolen Land Stolen Lives 
F*** Columbus Day,” before it 
was taken down by University 
staff in the afternoon. On last 
year’s 
Indigenous 
Peoples’ 
Day, Law School student John 
Petoskey organized a protest to 

recognize illegal 
land removal at 
the 
University 
Biological Station, 
and later submitted 
an 
inquiryto 
the 
University 
to 
investigate the history 
of the ownership of the 
land. 
The 
University 
is still in the process of 
addressing 
the 
complaint.
A dual-degree student in the 
School of Environment and 
Sustainability, Petoskey said he 
noticed an absence of anything 
recognizing the removal of 
Native Americans when he 
first visited the biostation.
“Growing up on my tribe’s 
reservation in Peshawbestown 
I had always heard stories 
of the event that came to 
be 
called 
‘the 
Burt 
Lake 
Burnout,’” 
Petoskey 
wrote 
in an email to The Daily. 
“The burnout was the illegal 
removal of the Burt Lake band 
from their treaty-guaranteed 
territory by lumber interests. 
The village was located on 
what is called “colonial point” 
not too far from the biostation. 
I found it disturbing that such 
a horrific event had taken 
place so close, but there was 
little to no recognition of 
it. I sought to change that.”
Petoskey said the President’s 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University History made a 
recommendation to work with 

local indigenous communities 
to reach an agreeable form of 
commemoration of the removal, 
and that he is “confident that 
the university has listened.”
As November approaches, 
planning for Native American 
Heritage Month is in full swing 
at the University. During this 
time, campus community is 
faced with reminders of its 
debt to the Ojibwe, Odawa 
and Potawatomi tribes who 
all participated in the Treaty 
of Fort Meigs in 1817. The 
treaty 
signed 
between 
the 
tribes and the U.S. allowed 
for the foundation of the 
University 
on 
native 
land 
with the agreement that the 
European 
settlers 
would 
provide 
higher 
education 
for 
native 
youth 
as 
well.
Despite 
this 
agreement, 
none of the tribes who signed 
directly 
experienced 
the 
benefits of the land grant, 
as records show that none 
attended the University for the 
next 130 years. The original 
land was sold and became part 
of the University’s endowment 

when the institution relocated 
to Ann Arbor from Detroit.
The 
University’s 
latest enrollment reports show 
85 Native American students 
attend 
the 
University, 
making up about .1 percent 
of the student body at large.
Today, 
a 
stone 
plaque, dedicated in November 
2002, stands on the ground of 
Ingalls Mall commemorating 
the 
land 
grant.
Now, more than 200 years 
after the treaty was signed, the 
Native American community 
says 
they 
are 
suffering, 
both at the University and 
nationally. American Indian/
Alaskan 
Native 
students 
held the lowest high school 
graduation rate compared to 
other subgroups and in 2016 
had a rate of suicide of 13.37 per 
100,000 people — the highest of 
any minority group. As a group, 
Native Americans maintain 
some of the highest rates of 
alcohol 
and 
drug 
abuse.
In September, the Mashpee 
Wampanoag tribe of Cape 
Cod faced a grim turn of 

events 
when 
the 
Trump 
administration 
reversed 
a 
2015 decision which entrusted 
more 
than 
300 
acres 
of 
land 
as 
a 
reservation 
for 
the 
Massachusetts 
tribe.
LSA 
sophomore 
Samara 
Jackson 
Tobey, 
external 
activist chair for the Native 
American Student Association, 
belongs to the Wampanoag 
Tribe. She’s focused efforts 
on helping to recruit and 
retain 
Native 
American 
students at the University— 
efforts she hopes will improve 
social conditions for Native 
Americans around the country.
“It’s 
important 
to 
understand that when a Native 
student comes to a campus like 
this, responsibilities become a 
burden,” Jackson-Tobey said. 
“There are so little of us that we 

have to represent 
ourselves tenfold, 
and 
we 
find 
ourselves 
in 
this 
position 
where 
our 
work, 
our 
perspective 
and our voice 
is needed. And 
yes 
it 
becomes 
demanding, 
but 
if we don’t do it, 
who’s going to do it?”
Currently, 
the 
University 
offers 
a 
Native 
American 
Studies 
minor, 
but 
Jackson-Tobey 
emphasized the need 
for further maturation 
of 
the 
department, 
especially in terms of a 
language requirement.
“Native 
American 
Studies is a history,” 
Jackson-Tobey 
said. 
“This 
is 
your 
connection 
back 
to 
who 
was 
originally 
here. You don’t have to 
be 
blood-indigenous 
to realize that there 
is a history still here, 
and somehow its small 
role in the American 
Culture 
Department 
seems 
to 
make 
it 
a 
joke. For example, why 
is a language in the 

Indigenous students remember a promise broken 
with Native American Heritage Month approaching

Over a century after Three Fires tribes ceded land to the University of Michigan, zero Native Americans were enrolled

Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation at Weiser Hall Monday evening. 

BENJAMIN ROSENFELD
For the Daily

“None of the 
three tribes 
who signed 
directly 
experienced 
the benefits of 
the land grant.” 

“There are 
so little of us 
that we have 
to represent 
ourselves 
tenfold.”


American Culture Department 
and not a language, or even 
in 
the 
Native 
American 
Studies 
Department, 
which 
we 
should 
have?”
Jackson-Tobey 
teamed 
up with the office of Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs and 
the Residential College to 
host 
events 
throughout 
November 
for 
Native 
American 
Heritage 
Month. 
She’s also helping to set the 
stage for this year’s Dance for 
Mother Earth Powwow, which 
will take place in the spring.
Jackson-Tobey emphasized 
the importance of respecting 
tradition 
and 
finding 
harmony between University 
students 
and 
the 
Three 
Fires tribes in Michigan, who 
participated 
in 
the 
initial 
land grant. The University 
has a particularly contentious 
relationship with tribes in 
Michigan. In addition to a 
lack of recruitment of Native 
American students, there was 
the 1902 creation of the racist 
honor society Michigamua, 
which 
appropriated 
sacred 
native traditions and objects 
while 
University 
officials 
participated. 
The 
name 
was 
changed 
as 
recently 
as 2007 to The Order of 
Angell, 
and 
has 
since 
claimed to cease reference 
to 
pseudo-native 
culture.
“This 
year, 
our 
team’s 
biggest goal is to bring our 
communities back together— 
meaning Michigan and our 
tribal 
communities— 
and 
asking for forgiveness from 
our 
tribal 
communities, 
because 
Michigan 
has 
wronged 
them 
in 
many 
ways,” she said. “One of our 
biggest symbols this year is a 
strawberry, which signifies 
forgiveness and friendship.”
Joel Begay, who graduated 
from the University in 2018 
with a master’s degree in 

Public 
Health, 
is 
Navajo 
and 
moved 
to 
Michigan 
to 
pursue 
molecular 
epidemiology after studying 
at Colorado College in an 
effort to relate his education 
back 
to 
Native 
American 
community health. He now 
works with the Great Lakes 
Inter-Tribal 
Epidemiology 
Center as an epidemiology 
officer and explained how 
the region has suffered from 
the lack of a large urban 
institute for epidemiologists.
“When 
we 
talk 
about 
health disparities for Native 
Americans 
in 
the 
United 
States, we see that Natives are 
disproportionately affected in 
many ways,” Begay said. “But 
just within Indian country 
of the Great Lakes region, 
the communities in this area 
are even more affected in 
comparison to other regions. 
There is a huge need that I had 
an opportunity to improve 
American 
Indian 
health.”
When 
coming 
to 
the 
University, Begay was struck 
by the school spirit, which 
he still holds close to his 
heart. 
However, 
he 
also 
found 
his 
identity 
deeply 
underrepresented and faced 
barriers to receiving faculty 
and institutional support to 
study Native American health.
“As a Native student, I 
wanted to not only have 
a research mentor to help 
me pursue my dreams of 
conducting 
Native 
health 
research, but I wanted them 
to be Native too,” he said. 
“Unfortunately, 
I 
didn’t 
find that, at least not until 
Jan. 2017, I met radiologist 
Dr. Roubidoux at Michigan 
Medicine. And we’ve been 
best friends since. Michigan is 
a leading research institution, 
which 
I 
appreciate, 
and 
that’s how I know I picked 
the right school. But it seems 
like 
everybody 
is 
doing 
the 
same 
work. 
Diversity 
is more than just a student 
body or faculty. It’s a matter 
of the things that they’re 

doing, 
funding 
sources.”
In 
regard 
to 
initiatives 
within 
the 
University’s 
Diversity, 
Equity 
and 
Inclusion 
plan, 
Begay 
emphasized 
the 
need 
for 
both 
academic 
research 
reflecting 
DEI 
concerns, 
especially 
in 
comparison 
to peer institutions, as well 
as 
faculty 
involvement.
“I think if we actually 
want to make DEI our utmost 
priority, then we need to have 
faculty participation,” he said. 
“When I go into a DEI event, 
I see a bunch of graduate 
students, a bunch of undergrad 
students, but where is the 
faculty? Where is the staff? 
Why aren’t they participating 
in these conversations? I think 
if Michigan really wanted 
to take DEI seriously, then 
faculty members, regardless of 
whether or not it’s in their job 
description, should go to DEI 
events. The majority of the 
student body is committed.”
Begay hopes the University 
will 
eventually 
create 
a 
physical 
space 
for 
Native 
American students to conduct 
cultural practices such as 
baking fry bread and smudging 
–– a ceremony involving the 
burning of sacred herbs –– 
as well as discussing topics 
personal to them. Additionally, 
he hopes for a center for 
Native 
American 
health 
to 
provide 
opportunities 
for students and create an 
expanding effect for diversity 
of 
research 
and 
faculty.
“I would love for Michigan 
to have a center for Native 
American 
health, 
as 
an 
opportunity and place for 
interdisciplinary 
studies 
that will incorporate public 
health, medical and social 
work researchers and provide 
a space for faculty to gather 
and 
generate 
hypothesis-
driven, 
yet 
culturally 
sensitive, research questions,” 
he said. “And then work with 
tribal 
communities, 
which 
would 
not 
only 
increase 
the 
diversity 
of 
Michigan 
research, but it would 
increase 
the 
diversity 
of faculty, and it would 
provide more internship 
opportunities 
for 
students, native or not.”
Rackham 
Assistant 
Dean Ethriam Brammer, 
DEI 
implementation 
lead, 
holds 
this 
issue 
personally as a former 
first-generation 
student 
of Mexican indigenous 
background. 
He 
said 
many Native American 
and minority students, 
in general, don’t have 
the 
resources 
to 
take 
advantage of educational 
opportunities.
”Genius 
and 
talent 
exist 
in 
all 
these 
communities, they’re just 
not fostered or provided 
the same resources to 
flourish 
in 
the 
same 
way,” Brammer said. “If 
we’re really intentional 
about serving all students 
at every point of this 
educational 
pipeline, 
then by the time they get 
to graduate school they 

should be well represented, 
right? The problem is that 
with 
certain 
communities 
that are under-resourced and 
under-served, 
the 
attrition 
happens 
throughout 
that 
pipeline at a very dramatic 
rate. To reverse it, you have 
to trace it back to the whole 
pre-K 
to 
Ph.D. 
pipeline.”
Brammer said the University 
is 
especially 
accountable 
for 
acknowledging 
its 
roots 
and 
pursuing 
educational 
initiatives.
“One thing the University 
can do better is tell the 
story of the founding of the 
University, and the role that 
the 
Native 
communities 
played 
in 
that 
founding,” 
he said. “The Fort Meigs 
treaty was intentionally a 
partnership to educate Native 
children along with European 
settlers. It’s better (to tell) that 
story, but also recognizing 
a certain responsibility to 
continuing to work with those 
communities to make sure 
the education needs of their 
young people can be met.”
While 
these 
goals 
are 
put on hold, students such 
as 
Jackson-Tobey 
are 
burdened with individually 
representing 
an 
extremely 
heterogeneous 
community.
“When I say I’m Mashpee 
Wampanoag, nine times out 
of 10, people are asking what 
that is,” Jackson-Tobey said. 
“Seldom do I meet someone 
who’s like, ‘Oh, you’re from 
Cape 
Cod.’ 
And 
because 
I’m brown, people question 
whether or not I’m really 
native. When our students 
are given the opportunity to 
learn their own culture and 
their 
own 
language, 
they 
are learning everything that 
they need to know to be the 
best them that they can be, 
and then they get to higher 
education and they’re told, 
‘That doesn’t fit here.’ That 
gets 
you 
(the) 
American 
Culture 
minor, 
which 
truthfully is not dependable.”
Jackson-Tobey 
said 
to 
preserve the future of Native 
Americans, 
educational 
support 
is 
more 
crucial 
than 
it 
ever 
has 
been.
“The 
knowledge 
Native 
communities 
cultivate 
can 
and should be developed,” she 
said. “Because that knowledge 
is dying out, and if the 
University doesn’t take heed 
of that, we’re going to lose 
more than just a community, 
we’re going to lose a whole 
history. And it starts with 
acknowledging our students. 
We need to make sure that 
Native students know they’re 
not alienated. No matter how 
different you are, you belong 
here. Because there’s a place 
for you, a place for your 
knowledge in this community, 
and we are not meant to stay 
in the corners of reservations. 
You 
belong 
here.”

the assembly and SACUA,” 
Lippert said. “Are we inviting 
them in effective ways to 
bring issues of their faculty 
forward?”
SACUA Vice Chair Joy 
Beatty, associate professor of 
Management Studies at the 
U-M Dearborn, recommended 
a points system to boost 
attendance among assembly 
members 
and 
increase 
involvement. 
Similar 
to 
techniques used on students, 
members agreed that the 
inclusion of such incentives 
could produce positive effects 
among faculty.
Touching 
on 
issues 
of 
achieving 
a 
quorum, 
the 

chronic 
truancy 
of 
some 
assembly 
members 
from 
meetings could stem from a 
variety of factors. Because 
quorum 
was 
established 
decades 
ago, 
attempts 
to 
amend the code have faltered. 
In order to change the quorum 
policy within the code, the 
number must be satisfied 
at the meeting in which the 
vote would take place. This 
continuous issue, in addition 
to the lack of interest and 
urgency among members, has 
contributed to low attendance 
numbers in recent years. In 
extreme cases, Beatty said 
some members do not realize 
they’re a part of the Senate 
Assembly.
“(Last meeting) there were 
15 or so people that were absent 
and were ‘no call, no show,’ 

and this is also happening 
in our committees,” Beatty 
said. “The question is, (are 
we) empowered to remove 
those people from (these) 
committee(s)?”
SACUA 
members 
then 
discussed 
the 
possibility 
of 
substituting 
current 
committee 
members 
for 
alternates, 
which 
Faculty 
Senate Secretary David Potter, 
a professor in the Classical 
Studies Department, stated 
is precedented and therefore 
legitimate.
“The 
problem 
is 
the 
Senate Assembly has created, 
technically, this committee 
so you can’t kick people off 
the committee, but there’s 
no reason why, following 
the parallel of the Senate 
Assembly, you can’t put in 

alternates,” Potter said.
SACUA 
Chair 
Neil 
Marsh, 
a 
professor 
of 
chemistry, 
suggested 
further possible strategies to 
enhance member engagement 
and participation. Marsh 
mentioned 
the 
possible 
inclusion 
of 
members 
in 
administrative affairs.
“One 
possibility 
that 
I 
raised was that, in searches 
for deans and directors … That 
one of the members of those 
committees would come from 
the Senate Assembly,” Marsh 
said. “That would certainly be 
a way of adding the voice of 
the faculty to the appointment 
of 
deans, 
directors 
and 
executive officers.”

session 
that 
includes 
instructions on how to have 
a productive discussion, as 
well as a quick run-through 
of facts necessary to have the 
discussions.
Upon 
arrival, 
students 
have to sign in and fill 
out 
a 
questionnaire. 
At 
Monday night’s session, the 
sign-in 
sheet 
asked 
about 
students’ 
political 
leanings 
and what they believe is 
the correct way to interpret 
the U.S. Constitution. This 
information is used to place 
attendees 
in 
groups 
that 
represent a diverse set of 
beliefs and political leanings. 
The University has co-signed 
many of WeListen’s events 
this year to promote values 
of dialogue and intellectual 

diversity.
During 
Monday 
night’s 
session, WeListen provided 
information on the history 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Court, 
and 
attempted 
to 
show, 
historically, the court has 
not been a very politicized 
institution. This was shown 
by a graph indicating a large 
number of the decisions on the 
court have been 9-0, with a few 
major exceptions. In the last 
century, however, the Court 
has historically served as a site 
of political tension on labor, 
race and women’s rights. 
After 
the 
information 
was provided, the students 
broke off into small groups to 
discuss questions about the 
Supreme Court, such as how 
the justices should interpret 
the Constitution or whether 
justices should be appointed 
for life. The groups consisted 
of people of all different 

majors and ages.
The 
session 
ended 
with 
a 
debriefing, 
where 
the 
co-presidents 
asked 
participants 
what 
they 
learned 
from 
the 
group 
members, challenges they had, 
suggestions for future sessions 
and suggestions on how to 
continue the discussions.
LSA junior Vivian Righter 
said she felt the discussion 
changed the way she viewed 
her own stance on politics.
“What I’ve taken away from 
it is being more reflexive of 
my own personal opinions,” 
Righter said. “So not just 
necessarily listening to others 
critique each other, but also 
being responsive to what your 
own biases are coming into 
this before you listen, and 
reflecting on where your own 
opinions may come from.”
Multiple students said they 
felt the discussions gave them 

an 
appreciation 
for 
other 
political views. .
Still, 
politics 
aside, 
testimony by Dr. Christine 
Blasey Ford recounting her 
alleged past assault at the 
hands of the justice seemed 
to sway voters on the Senate’s 
confirmation vote. A CNN poll 
conducted last week found 
51 percent of Americans oppose 
Kavanaugh being voted ont 
the bench. A different tone 
also pervaded at Thursday’s 
march for survivors where 
EMU 
sophomore 
Lindsey 
Brown said the confirmation 
was not divide of right versus 
left but an issue morality. “I 
think when we look back we 
are going to see a clear divide 
of who was on the right side 
of history and who was on 
the side of history that didn’t 
want to listen to survivors 
and the people who have been 
systematically 
oppressed,” 

Brown said.
Education junior Hannah 
Ploof, on the other hand, said 
Monday evening she valued 
the opportunity to converse 
with people whose beliefs 
didn’t align with her own.
“Before this session, any 
conversation I had had about 
Kavanaugh was basically just 
an echo chamber of my own 
thoughts, and so whenever I’d 
be speaking about it, it always 
just got me more amped up,” 
Ploof said. “But after this, 
I have more opinions and 
I’m not as stressed about 
the situation, I’m more just 
calm and thinking about it. 
So I think that talking about 
things in less of a high-stress 
situation and more about our 
thoughts should be applied to 
when I talk about politics in 
general so I can consistently 
not get angry about things.”

began planning for a renewed 
commitment to diversity, equity 
and inclusion. This planning 
culminated in an $85 million five-
year strategic plan that was 
presented two years ago and 
marked the beginning of the DEI 
initiative. Now, almost halfway 
through the implementation of 
this plan, the University is using 
the summit as an opportunity 
to reflect on its progress and 
plan for the future. The plan 
has, at times, been a source of 
contention with students of color, 
those with disabilities and low-
income students. 
The assembly began with a 
brief speech from Robert Sellers, 
chief diversity officer and vice 
provost for Equity and Inclusion 
at the University. Sellers has 
been responsible for overseeing 
much of the DEI initiatives, and 
expressed pride in the work.
Following 
Sellers, 
Regent 
Andrew Richner (R) emphasized 
the 
Board 
of 
Regents’s 
commitment to diversity, equity 
and inclusion and introduced 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel. Schlissel emphasized 
the 
role 
of 
the 
University 
community 
in 
facilitating 
necessary change.
“When 
we 
renewed 
our 
journey to enhance diversity, 
equity and inclusion at the 
University of Michigan less 
than four years ago, we knew 
we had the power of an amazing 
community to carry us forward,” 
Schlissel said. “It’s a community 
of thousands, past and present, 
who share their intellect, their 
commitment to accountability, 
and their passion for a better 
university and a better society.”
Schlissel acknowledged the 
DEI initiative has a long way 
to go and promised to hold the 
University accountable for its 
work.
“We 
know 
that 
many 
challenges remain as we strive 
to ensure that the U-M is 
welcoming for all who live, work 
and study here,” Schlissel said. 
“These challenges will continue 
to drive our work in the months 
and years ahead. We also will 
rigorously evaluate our progress 
to ensure accountability with 
the goal of achieving the greatest 
possible impact for all members 
of our community.”
Following Schlissel’s speech, 
Sellers gave a brief overview 
of the University’s progress 
on the DEI initiative over the 
last two years. He explained 
several specific programs the 
University has implemented in 
the initiative and reviewed the 
administration’s stated goals of 
developing a diverse student body 
and faculty, promoting a more 
inclusive climate and infusing 
DEI goals into teaching and 
service on campus. Sellers then 
previewed the administration’s 
upcoming efforts, including new 
sexual misconduct policies and 
internal and external review of 
the DEI initiative as a whole.
Nearing 
the 
end 
of 
his 
speech, 
Sellers 
echoed 
the 
ideas expressed by Schlissel by 
praising the progress achieved 
to this point but emphasizing the 
work is far from over.
“One of the things I can tell 
you from the bottom of my heart 
is that we still have a long way 
to go,” Sellers said. “But I can 
also tell you we have also made 
a great deal of progress in the 
past three years. We are not the 
same institution that we were 
when we started. We are a more 
diverse, equitable and inclusive 
community, and we will continue 
to work to be even more so.”
Sellers was followed at the 
podium 
by 
Katrina 
Wade-
Golden, deputy chief diversity 
officer, 
 
who 
introduced 
Guerrero as the event’s keynote 
speaker. Guerrero, the daughter 
of undocumented immigrants, 
is an advocate for comprehensive 
immigration 
reform 
in 
the 
United States. Pulitzer-winning 
journalist 
Leonard 
Pitts 
moderated the discussion.
Guerrero spoke at length 
about her experiences growing 
up with undocumented parents. 
Having been born in the U.S., 
she grew up in Boston in a 
predominantly Black and Latinx 
community. 

Proposal 3, as it would work to 
prevent 
disenfranchisement 
of voters who struggled to 
navigate the voting process. 
In 
her 
opening 
remarks, 
she detailed her work for 
the ACLU, which included 
working with voters turned 
away at the polls on Election 
Day. Dolente said even a single 
voter disenfranchised by the 
Michigan 
electoral 
system 
represents a major problem 
that needs to be resolved.
“I hear a lot of noise and 
chaos of what happens on 
Election Day,” Dolente said. 
“I hear all the challenges that 
voters are facing when they 
go to cast their ballots here in 
Michigan. Voters are turned 
away in every single election. 
Voters are turned away right 
here in Ann Arbor. Voters are 
turned away in the primaries. 
Every election I talked to 
voters who were turned away 
at the ballot box.”

Panelist 
Nancy 
Wang, 
board president of Voters Not 
Politicians, an organization 
whose goal is to promote 
Proposal 
2 
and 
end 
gerrymandering in Michigan. 
Wang said the issue isn’t 
explaining the nuances of the 
proposal, but rather making 
sure people know what’s on 
the ballot before they get to 
the polls. Both Wang and 
Dolente said Michigan has 
fallen behind on adopting key 
election reforms, specifically 
involving voter registration 
and gerrymandering. 
“Right 
now, 
we 
have 
thousands of volunteers that 
are knocking on doors, just 
spreading the word,” Wang 
said. “Our challenge right 
now is not with the proposal. 
Everyone 
we 
can 
spend 
about 10 to 15 seconds with 
understands that this policy 
makes sense.”
The 
second 
initiative 
discussed 
at 
the 
event, 
Proposal 2, drew much more 
debate from members of the 
panel. As the law currently 
stands, 
redistricting 
is 

controlled by politicians of 
the majority party in the state 
legislature, and leaders are 
not required to disclose to the 
public information regarding 
the 
redistricting 
process. 
Proposal 
2 
would 
imbue 
far 
greater 
transparency 
in process: if the initiative 
passes, 
Michigan 
residents 
would be able to apply to be 
members of the commission.
However, panelist Richard 
McLellan, an election law 
attorney, 
claimed 
while 
Proposal 
2’s 
intent 
is 
honest, in practice, it would 
ultimately be unsuccessful. 
McLellan 
said 
the 
policy 
would establish a convoluted 
structure inevitably resulting 
in disputes and would bypass 
the 
legislative 
process 
by 
being incorporated directly 
into the state constitution. 
Furthermore, 
he 
said 
constantly changing opinions 
would make such a permanent 
change detrimental to the 
electoral system.
Another element of Proposal 
2 mandates members of the 
redistricting 
commission 

isolate themselves from others 
during 
the 
redistricting 
process. McLellan said this 
amount of distancing from the 
public is unrealistic in today’s 
digital 
age 
and 
isolation 
from the general population 
could lead to ill-informed 
redistricting.
“It 
bans 
commissioners 
from 
talking 
to 
ordinary 
people,” 
McLellan 
said. 
“You can only talk to your 
staff, attorneys, experts and 
consultants. These are a group 
of randomly-selected people. I 
want them walking around, 
talking to people. I don’t think 
that’s good public policy.”
The panel was co-sponsored 
by WeListen, a bipartisan 
student 
organization 
that 
aims to foster discussion on 
contentious political issues. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Taylor 
Smith is a member of the 
organization and said she 
liked weighing the contrasting 
ideologies offered by members 
of the panel.
“It was very interesting 
to 
hear 
the 
conservative 
viewpoint 
and 
the 
liberal 

viewpoint,” Smith said. “I like 
to be totally informed before 
making a decision, as opposed 
to just listening to one side.”
Toward 
the 
end 
of 
the 
event, 
Public 
Policy 
students, as well as others in 
attendance, were encouraged 
to submit questions for the 
panel to discuss. Tom Ivacko, 
the associate director of the 
Center for Local, State and 
Urban Policy at the Public 
Policy School, said this was 
representative of the type 
of discourse Public Policy 
students are encouraged to 
engage in.
“We try to foster at the Ford 
School a focus on conversation 
across differences, and these 
potential 
policy 
reforms 
represent significant change 
that could fall along partisan 
divides,” Ivacko said. “We’re 
trying to foster civil discourse 
about 
challenging 
policy 
issues.”
Organizations, departments 
and other institutional actors 
across campus are boosting 
voter 
registration 
efforts 
before the pivotal midterms.

W

e 
just 
passed 
the 
17-year 
anniversary 
of 
the 
war 
in 
Afghanistan. 
You 
know, the one most 
people forget we’re 
actually 
fighting 
because we’ve been 
there since most of us 
can remember. And 
yet, despite the fact 
that most of us don’t 
exactly 
understand 
why we keep sending 
our soldiers overseas, 
thousands of men 
and women are still 
dying as a result of this war, both 
from our country and theirs. This 
is the longest war in American 
history, and while the basics are 
well known, what is not known is 
why a seemingly in-and-out job 
has stretched on for 17 years.
As is common knowledge, the 
war in Afghanistan started as a 
result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 
In response to these attacks, 
the 
U.S. 
decided 
to 
invade 
Afghanistan in order to find 
Osama bin Laden, remove the 
Taliban from power and prevent 
Afghanistan from harboring any 
more 
terrorist 
organizations. 
While Osama bin Laden was 
killed in 2011 and the Taliban 
rule was toppled in 2001, the 
Taliban insurgency remained. 
Up until leaving office in 2017, 
former President Barack Obama 
had been slowly drawing troops 
out of Afghanistan and focusing 
on advising the new government 
rather than fighting. However, 
Trump 
has 
stated 
the 
war 
will continue for an indefinite 
period of time and has loosened 
restrictions placed on military 
action in Afghanistan imposed 
by the Obama administration. 
We have spent almost 1.07 trillion 
dollars, cost 2,403 American 
servicemen their lives and lost 
28,000 Afghan civilian lives on 
the war in Afghanistan, not to 
mention the 17,674 servicemen 
and 50,000 Afghan civilians 
injured.
Right now, we’re at the 
point where we can’t exactly 
win, but there’s still a lot to lose. 
With the Taliban still linked to 
al-Qaeda, there remains a chance 
for more terrorist attacks. John 
Nicholson, the U.S. commander 

in Afghanistan has said, “There 
is a threat from this region to our 
homeland. So our choice is fairly 
simple: We either keep 
the pressure on them 
here, or they bring the 
fight to our doorstep.” 
Yet we have funneled 
billions of dollars and 
thousands of soldiers 
into a fight where we 
cannot seem to come 
out on top.
This 
threat 
perceived 
by 
our 
leaders 
continues 
to 
bring men and women 
into foreign territory to fight a 
war they know very little about. 
But while this has been the case 
for many years, what’s different 
now is this year kids who weren’t 
even alive when the war started 

can now enlist to fight. Think 
about that. These kids don’t even 
know life not at war. Living the 
majority of our lives post-9/11 has 
changed our generation in ways 
we can’t possibly understand 
because we don’t know anything 
different.
The New York Times recently 
put out a feature by C.J. Chivers 
on 
a 
then-19-year-old 
man 
named Robert Soto, a specialist 
in the First Battalion of the 26th 
Infantry, fighting in Afghanistan. 
Chivers interviewed Soto in 2009 
and learned he was 10 years 
old when the twin towers were 
struck. He distinctly remembers 
being picked up from school by 
his father and seeing the fear in 
his eyes. Though he was young, 
this had a profound impact on 
his life and led him to enlist in 
the infantry in 2007. He said he 
wanted to be an actor after the 
war if he survives.

“He had his idealism and 
his hope scraped away at an 
extraordinarily 
young 
age,” 
Chivers wrote about Soto losing 
friends and people he admired 
in the violence. While the story 
of Robert Soto is a sad one, he 
understood what he was fighting 
for. He grew up in New York 
and was deeply affected by the 
attacks. 
He 
understood 
the 
magnitude of the event because 
he remembered what life was like 
before. Our generation has not 
had that experience.
Having grown up in a post-
9/11 era, our generation is so 
removed from the war, we don’t 
even consider it in our everyday 
lives. We barely even consider 
our country at war at all. Because 
this war is being fought halfway 
around the world, and not at our 
doorstep, it removes us from 
the everyday consequences of 
growing up in a country at war.
Everyone is asking when the 
war will be over, but not enough 
people are asking what effect 
the war will have or has already 
had. This is impossible to answer 
because we don’t know when it 
will end and we don’t know what 
life was like before. People are 
giving up their lives for a war they 
don’t even remember starting. It 
has simply become a part of our 
existence now. The question is: 
What do we do about it?
While we can’t exactly pull all 
of our troops out of Afghanistan 
today and let the people left there 
fend for themselves, we do need 
to reevaluate what we can and 
should be doing in Afghanistan 
to alleviate the situation. There 
are many ethnic and tribal 
complexities 
at 
play, 
which 
makes the situation difficult to 
assess. The idea of recruiting and 
training a national Afghan army 
has been proposed to improve 
the situation, but this has already 
failed. There is no guarantee that 
these ideas or solutions will ease 
the situation, but what we are 
currently doing is not working 
and something has to change. 
Because 17 years is too long to be 
fighting.

Body shaming
E

llery Rosenzweig makes 
an incredible point about 
current views of fat people 
in our society. As someone who 
has identified as a bigger person 
throughout the course of her life, 
I find that the current ideology 
toward fat people is extremely 
harmful and polarizing. I think 
that stereotypes involving this 
group of individuals were rooted 
in our minds during the formative 
stages of development and are 
currently perpetuated through the 
outlet of social media.
At a young age, we are shown 
that fat people, especially women, 
are evil or lazy. For example, 
the only fat characters that have 
significant roles in Disney movies 
just so happen to be the villains, 

such as Ursula from “The Little 
Mermaid” or the Queen of Hearts 
from 
“Alice 
in 
Wonderland.” 
This is not to say that every evil 
character is heavier, but to suggest 
that the only time fat people are 
represented is when they are of 
minimal interest to the story or 
when they are the villain. This 
may cause children to associate fat 
people with negativity, whether 
they actually are cognizant of 
these messages or not.
Though we are not little 
kids 
anymore, 
we 
are 
still 
being influenced by these toxic 
narratives through social media. 
While higher numbers on the 
scale can and do lead to health 
problems, those with extremely 
skinny frames can also face these 

difficulties, though these people 
are often praised for their figures 
on social media. I don’t believe 
that we should normalize any 
exceptional weight, either low or 
high, as being “healthy,” but I do 
believe that we should encourage 
the perpetuation of all people as 
beautiful.
Once we stop associating a 
number with beauty and morals, 
“body positivity” will truly become 
a positive way to instill confidence 
instead of a response to society’s 
hatred of fat.

Are we there yet? 17 years since Afghanistan

DANA PIERANGELI | COLUMN

Sophie Holohan is a high school 

student at Notre Dame High School in 

San Jose, CA.

I

n 
recent 
weeks, 
the 
nation has been gripped 
by the ugly controversy 
surrounding 
Brett 
Kavanaugh’s 
confirmation 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
On one side, Kavanaugh’s 
supporters describe him as a 
“carpool dad.” That was the 
prevailing 
narrative 
until 
several of his high school and 
college classmates, including 
Christine 
Blasey 
Ford, 
Deborah Ramirez and Julie 
Swetnick, 
came 
forward 
to recount a very different 
version of Kavanaugh.
One 
common 
thread 
among the various accounts 
of 
a 
young 
Kavanaugh’s 
violence, 
whether 
it 
be 
sexual assault or a bar fight, 
is 
alcohol. 
Hearing 
the 
stories of Ford, Ramirez, 
Swetnick and others paints a 
familiar, horrifying picture 
for us college students. We 
all 
know 
either 
someone 
like young Kavanaugh or 
someone who has been hurt 
by such a person.
Just like attorney Anita 
Hill’s 
testimony 
in 
1991 
sparked a deep conversation 
about workplace harassment, 
the 
stories 
of 
Ford 
and 
the 
others 
should 
begin 
a 
national 
conversation 
about the kind of excessive 
consumption of alcohol, and 
the consequences of such 
behavior Kavanaugh engaged 
in during his high school and 
college years.
There 
were 
many 
disturbing 
revelations 
and 
reactions 
throughout 
Kavanaugh’s 
confirmation 
process, from the unhinged 
diatribe 
by 
Sen. 
Lindsey 
Graham, 
R-S.C., 
against 
the Democrats to President 
Trump’s open mockery of 
Ford at a Mississippi rally. 
I cannot begin to imagine 
how sexual assault survivors 
across America must have 
felt as they watched Ford’s 
harrowing 
testimony 
and 
the following wave of vitriol 
from Kavanaugh’s defenders.
The fight to keep Brett 
Kavanaugh off the Supreme 
Court bench may have been 
lost, but good can still come 
from 
this. 
For 
example, 
the Rape, Abuse and Incest 
National 
Network 
sexual 
assault hotline saw a 147 
percent spike in calls. More 
can and should be done, 
because there are hundreds, 
if not thousands, of young 
men like Kavanaugh who 
have 
committed 
sexual 
violence while under the 
influence of alcohol, and 
thousands of young women 
who have been victimized 

like Ford.
I 
have 
no 
doubt 
that, 
even without alcohol, Brett 
Kavanaugh 
has 
and 
will 
continue to use his power and 
privilege to hurt women. His 
judicial record of anti-choice 
decisions is a clear example, 
as 
was 
his 
disturbing 
exchange 
with 
Sen. 
Amy 
Klobuchar, D-Minn., where 
he 
deflected 
a 
question 
about his own history with 
alcohol and instead asked the 
Senator if she had ever gotten 
blackout drunk. Klobuchar’s 
father has struggled with 
alcoholism, a fact that she 
revealed 
in 
the 
hearing, 
and his retort was a cruel, 
disrespectful low blow.
We 
need 
to 
change 

the 
culture 
surrounding 
alcohol and drunk behavior. 
Kavanaugh should have been 
called 
out 
three 
decades 
ago — before he assaulted 
Ford 
and 
others 
— 
by 
his group of friends who 
undoubtedly 
noticed 
his 
violent tendencies. Instead, 
his 
friend 
group 
enabled 
him and each other in what 
they 
described 
in 
their 
high school yearbook as the 
treasurer of the “Keg City 
Club — 100 Kegs or Bust.”
In our culture, on campus 
and beyond, alcohol is often 
seen as an excuse for bad 
behavior. Brett Kavanaugh 
and 
Brock 
Turner, 
the 
ex-Stanford swimmer who 
raped an unconscious woman, 
were both exonerated in the 
eyes of thousands of people 
because of alcohol. Now, of 
course, white male privilege 
played 
an 
arguable 
role 
(would a woman or man of 
color be so easily forgiven?) 
but we should not ignore how 
alcohol makes it easier to 
overlook their violence.
While 
reading 
accounts 
of 
Kavanaugh’s 
behavior 
in high school and at Yale, 
I could not help but recall 
the story of the president of 
one University of Michigan 
fraternity (I will not name 

names) who told a sorority 
president that “it isn’t my 
fault that your girls can’t 
handle their liquor” when 
she confronted him about the 
sexual 
assault 
perpetrated 
by his fraternity brothers. 
That sentiment was basically 
replicated on the floor of 
the Senate and in the media. 
Alcohol washes violent men of 
their sins but not women.
From Greek life to Capitol 
Hill, 
America 
needs 
a 
fundamental reset on how 
we view alcohol and drunk 
behavior. We have already 
done so with drunk driving 
— just look at any number of 
“Drive Sober or Get Pulled 
Over” commercials. If hurting 
someone in a traffic accident 
while under the influence of 
alcohol is looked down upon in 
the harshest terms by society, 
then so should all kinds of 
alcohol-related violence.
I’m sure everyone who has 
drunk alcohol has said or 
done something regrettable 
and problematic, sometimes 
very problematic. We all need 
to hold ourselves accountable 
for what we do while under 
the influence, no matter how 
severe the mistakes we make 
are. I understand why using 
alcohol to absolve ourselves of 
our mistakes is so tempting, 
as the alternative is shame 
and guilt. But that shame is 
telling us that we have done 
something wrong, and instead 
of burying that feeling we 
should use it as a catalyst for 
change.
If a person cannot control 
themselves or remember what 
they do while drunk, they 
have a responsibility to make 
sure they do not get to that 
point, whether it be by getting 
sober or moderating their 
drinking. Every perpetrator of 
alcohol-induced violence was 
responsible 
for 
themselves 
getting 
to 
that 
point. 
I 
understand that alcohol is 
addictive, and I do not mean 
to shame people struggling 
with 
alcoholism; 
however, 
our society’s attitude towards 
alcohol, in my opinion, fuels 
the self-denial that keeps many 
people from getting the help 
they need.
By holding ourselves and 
those close to us accountable 
for 
our 
behavior 
while 
drinking, instead of sweeping 
it under the rug, we can 
hopefully begin a culture shift 
that can prevent future Brett 
Kavanaughs before they hurt 
others.

“Love 
Has 
a 
Thousand 
Shapes,” an exhibit now on 
display at the Ann Arbor Arts 
Center until Oct. 27, explores 
the many ways in which love 
manifests itself and tells tales 
reflective of each artist’s personal 
experience. While the point of 
the exhibit is to demonstrate how 
love can be just about anything, 
the diverse works lack a common 
ground to prove this point.
Artist 
Justin 
Marshall 
depicts the love present in our 
most 
intimate 
environments, 
expressed 
through 
our 
belongings, decor, pets, etc. In 
“Jeff and Delorian,” a figure, 
supposedly Jeff, stands facing 
us with his cat tightly within his 
grasp. He wears Mario boxers, 
and behind him he has Garfield 
sheets and a painting of Garfield 
lovingly petting two humans as 
they fall asleep. 
One might ask, then, why 
Marshall 
wouldn’t 
simply 
photograph a moment like this. 
It’s because photographs are 
just that: depictions of things 
at a particular moment, scenes 
subject to change. What Marshall 
hoped to show here were the 
qualities of people, as expressed 
by their pets, sheets, decorations 
and attire that outlive this 

singular moment. This is what 
love means to Marshall.
Several of Judy Bowman’s 
works also take on the theme 
of love in the little things, but 
focus primarily on the African 
American 
experience. 
In 
Bowman’s “Love Song,” we see a 
couple that appear dressed to go 
out, instead simply enjoying each 
other’s company at home. Their 
faces, constructed by no more 
than five or six pieces of paper, 

capture great emotion.
Although her works have 
a real life to them, they don’t 
particularly seem to fit the 
theme of love apart from the one 
shown here. Her collages capture 

patterns, objects and scenes 
prevalent in African American 
life. They seem much more 
oriented towards capturing this 
experience than demonstrating 
the love all around us.
Patrick 
Burton 
takes 
the 
abstraction one large step further 
in his portrayals of love. Three 
out of Burton’s four pieces on 
display were colorful depictions 
of hearts blooming out of flower 
vases, backgrounded by intricate 
ornaments and a variety of birds 
and leaves. Here, the meticulous 
act of putting together these 
individually-cut pieces of wood 
covered in paper maché, paint 
and Swarovski crystals seems 
like the expression of love itself. 
The works look ready to be 
delivered to the doorstep of 
Burton’s lover to their great 
delight. 
Their 
similarities 
lead us to compare the subtle 
differences in each. Each has 
an inscription at the bottom 
center. The first reads “1925,” the 
second, “bubala” and the third, 
“kookanut.” 
Your guess is as good as mine 
as to the meaning of each, but 
it’s clear that Burton wants us 
to ponder this question. The 
terms 
certainly 
prevent 
us 
from dismissing the flowery 
arrangements as mere wallpaper 
or postcard material. They do 
also, however, call into question 
the genuinity of these works 
as expressions of love. How 
could Burton invest so much 
time in carefully assembling 
each of these pieces, embedding 
Swarovski 
crystals 
in 
each, 
and then place phrases front 
and center that seem to have 
no inherent connection to the 
patterns they foreground?
The 
exhibit 
advertised 
itself as a collection of diverse 
expressions of love, and it 
certainly offered this diversity. 
However, the variety of the 
works does lead one to question 
the broadness of the exhibit’s 
theme. If art creation in itself is 
an act of love, literally anything 
could have found its way into the 
exhibit. 
Love is indeed present in 
our lives at home with our 
pets, 
for 
example, 
but 
the 
exhibit missed talking points 
— polyamorous relationships, 
hookups, marriage, etc. — that 
are all particularly relevant for 
an exhibit representative of our 
“diverse contemporary culture.” 
While I suppose the point of 
the exhibit was to point out 
that love can present itself in 
just about anything, the lack of 
cohesion between the different 
conversations of each artist 
makes this point fall short of the 
mark. 

I’m going to be honest: 
At what I figured to be the 
halfway point of “Venom,” 
I took stock of my feelings 
and realized I liked what I 
had seen so far. I don’t mean 
to sound overly surprised by 
this, but after “Spider-Man 
3,” 
“The 
Amazing 
Spider-
Man 2” and the 2014 Sony 
Pictures email leaks revealed 
an inability on the part of Sony 
higher-ups 
to 
comprehend 
what makes Spider-Man and 
his rogues gallery work on any 
level whatsoever, I can’t say 
my hopes were particularly 
high. Sitting there, though, I 
reasoned that “Venom” wasn’t 
anything special, but provided 
the second half expanded on 
the character arcs and shored 
up the weak story, there was 
something workable there.
Then the climax started and 
the movie ended. “Oh,” I said, 
“That’s it.” 
The last two times they’ve 
killed their fledgling Spider-
Series, Sony has done so by 
cramming as many plotlines 
and recognizable characters as 
possible into a single, bloated 
narrative. This time, in what 
seems like a truly misguided 
overcompensation, 
they’ve 
done the same thing — albeit 
without Spidey himself, who 
is 
too 
busy 
appearing 
in 
competently written movies to 
show up — by stripping their 
story and characters down to 
their bare bones and hoping 
nobody notices that they still 
don’t know what they’re doing.
Everything a good movie 
should have, “Venom” has 
almost exactly one half of. 
It has the introduction of a 

likeable lead in Eddie Brock 
(Tom 
Hardy, 
“Dunkirk,” 
doing his best Nick Miller 
impression) and the beginning 
of an arc that will see him, true 
to the tagline, embracing his 
inner anti-hero, but it doesn’t 
ever return to or wrap up that 

arc. By the end of the movie, 
Eddie isn’t an anti-hero, he’s 
just a superhero with a weird 
tongue.
It 
introduces 
the 
counterpoint 
to 
Eddie 
in 
Venom, the alien symbiote 
which bonds with the idealistic 
reporter, and includes the end 
of the arc which sees him in 
a different headspace than 
he began, but it doesn’t show 
how he got there. Point A 
and Point B are there, but the 
story and arc that would tie 
them together and make for 
a satisfying story are absent, 
replaced with boring trudging 
from one set piece to the next. 
Eddie 
and 
Venom 
simply 
don’t interact with each other 
enough outside of pithy one-
liners to have changed each 
other in the way the film wants 
you to believe.
It’s sure to cast a talented 
actor as its villain, Carlton 
Drake (Riz Ahmed, “Rogue 
One: A Star Wars Story”), but it 
fails to give him anything to do 
outside of grating monologues 
about how humanity is evil and 

he’s the only one who can save 
them. It seems to realize far 
too late that nothing about him 
is intimidating, but instead of 
fixing the villain they’ve got, 
they introduce another one at 
the top of the third act who 
— and I’m quoting Venom the 
alien symbiote here — “has 
got shit you ain’t never seen” 
which 
winds 
up 
meaning 
knives, axes and other shit you 
most certainly have seen.
There is some comedy that 
works, 
particularly 
in 
the 
relationship between Eddie 
and Venom, but more often than 
not, it’s just uncomfortable. 
Even when it goes for weird-
with-a-capital-W, 
it’s 
not 
weird enough to be watchable 
just for that. Sure, the scene 
where Tom Hardy sits in a 
lobster tank is the sort of 
thing we’ll be meme-ing in a 
few years, and yes, it features 
one of the strangest onscreen 
kisses in the history of film, 
but do you really want to sit 
through two hours of set ups 
with no follow-through and 
follow-throughs with no set up 
for a few seconds of “Oh, dear 
God?”
At 
its 
best, 
“Venom” 
is 
occasionally 
fun 
and 
personable, but it’s coming 
out in a time when comic 
book movies are supposed to 
be more than just that. Last 
year, 
“Logan” 
became 
the 
first 
live-action 
superhero 
movie to be nominated for 
a 
screenwriting 
Academy 
Award, and the smart money 
says that in a few months, 
“Black Panther” will be a Best 
Picture nominee. Sony wants 
that kind of success with their 
“Spider-Man” properties, but 
“Venom” shows they’re still 
not interested in putting in the 
work.

FILM REVIEW

MUSIC

Cat Power’s Chan Marshall 
is a master of her own sound. 
She may not be the most 
virtuosic instrumentalist, nor 
a classically trained singer, 
or even have a clear message, 
but this doesn’t matter. Her 
greatest talent lies in the 
ether, in the raw intensity 
of her soft-spoken lyrics and 
imperfect piano that seem 
to evoke every feeling at 
once. 
Marshall’s 
music 
as 
Cat Power is heavy with the 
quiet gravity of emotion and 
longing, something that comes 
to a peak on her newest record, 
Wanderer. The album harkens 
back to her earlier work on 
critically acclaimed albums 
like The Greatest, in which 
Marshall weaves abstract yet 
poignant storytelling, spare 
instrumentation 
and 
her 
uniquely 
understated 
voice 
together to create cinematic 
soundscapes. It seems fated 
that Wanderer comes as Power’s 

10th full-length production: In 
every song, it is easy to hear 
her influences from both past 
and present come together to 
make something filled with 
an uncanny individuality. The 
album marks an important 
point in time for Marshall 
after 20 years in music, as she 
cuts a new and bright trail for 

herself through the industry.
It wasn’t easy for Marshall to 
release this album in the first 
place, facing pushback from 
her previous label, Matador, 
to the point of breaking ties. 
On the tails of her 2012 album 
Sun’s success, which combined 
her classic pared-down sound 
with 
heavier 
electronic 
production, the mainstream 
sound of small-time hits like 
“Manhattan” were the clear 
path for Marshall to follow, 
but instead the singer stayed 
true to her own vision of the 

future. And thank God she 
did Wanderer, completely self-
written and self-produced, is a 
tour de force. Marshall’s work 
as Cat Power on this record 
could be blues, folk, rock or 
indie pop, but it’s difficult 
to pin down. This is the best 
part of her music by far, but 
an understandable reason for 
frustration from labels past. 
Listening to Cat Power is like 
trying to catch minnows; as 
soon as you think you have 
finally captured her in a 
certain light, she slips right 
through your fingers again, 
dancing into another wistful 
tangent.
The intangible quality of 
Wanderer may be confusing 
at first, but once a listener 
has accepted it, each track 
is an adventure of its own. A 
clear standout is the Lana Del 
Rey collaboration “Woman,” 
the 
album’s 
second 
single 
and one of its most complex 
arrangements. The song is 
at once an anthem, soliloquy 
and battle cry, ruminating on 
the double-consciousness of 
womanhood and the need for 

The quiet gravity of Cat 
Power’s new ‘Wanderer’

CLARA SCOTT
Daily Arts Writer

self-reliance in a world full of 
doubters. Del Rey is a perfect 
partner for Marshall on the 
single and the two are clearly 
kindred 
spirits; 
the 
same 
ethereal magic is present in 
either musician’s work, and it 
was only a matter of time until 
they found each other. Directly 
following “Woman” is the slow 
ballad “Horizon,” a letter to 
family as Cat Power leaves 
home to face the open road. The 
simplicity of the tune mirrors 
“Woman”’s complications to 
cradle the listener in comfort 
and nostalgia that eventually 
dissolves 
into 
fragmented 
vocal 
effects, 
mimicking 
the shimmer of the sun as it 

goes down in the song. Other 
highlights on Wanderer are 
“You Get,” a bluesy collection 
of angst and vocal layering that 
collides 
harmoniously, 
and 
Marshall’s unplugged piano-
and-strings cover of Rihanna’s 
hit 
“Stay,” 
a 
hauntingly 
melodic ballad with immense 
emotional weight.
The 
record 
begins 
and 
concludes 
with 
different 
versions of the title track 
“Wanderer,” 
Marshall’s 
meditation on love through 
the lens of loss. “Wanderer” 
and “Wanderer/Exit” are two 
sides of the same coin, acting 
as bookends to the rambling 
emotional content of the album 

at large. “Oh wanderer, I’ve 
been wondering,” she sings, 
“If your brown eyes still have 
color, could I see?”
The 11 songs on Marshall’s 
most recent opus set a parallel 
between lover and wanderer, 
on the uncertainty of it all 
and the answer that music 
can offer. It’s hard to know 
whether to laugh or cry at any 
given portion of the album, but 
that is where its true beauty 
hides. Cat Power is a vessel 
for Chan Marshall’s purest 
thoughts, and on Wanderer, 
every moment comes through 
crystallized, 
suspended 
in 
time by her elusive magic.

Of all the fads that have 
come 
and 
gone 
societally, 
one of the more prominent 
cultural obsessions is the push 
for immersion in a world of 
DIY. From your own house, 
to your clothes, to the entire 
world of crafting, there really 
isn’t anything that we can’t 
somehow make for ourselves. 
A beautifully, and in most 
cases 
empowering, 
concept 
emerging from this hands-
on world is a completely new 
breed 
of 
self-motivators, 
spearheading 
self-activism 
and opening the world of “do it 
yourself” to the complex realm 
of 
cosmetics. 
With 
beauty 
blogs, 
tutorials, 
YouTube 
channels, Instagram accounts 
and even entire businesses 
dedicated to self-improvement 
— through not just cosmetic 
products, but beauty routines 
as a whole — an entire new 
concept fabricates itself from 
within the depths of DIY 
pitfalls. This world, practice 
— or rather, expectation — is a 
concept called aesthetic labor, 
and it’s changing femininity as 
we know it.
We’ve seen it on Vogue’s 
regular 
Instagram 
posts 
showcasing 
and 
promoting 
various 
celebs’ 
seemingly 
flawless makeup routines, and 
Glossier’s entire blog “Into the 
Gloss” rests not on the actual 
products, but rather aesthetic 
labor. As defined by Ana Sophia 
Elias in her book “Aesthetic 
Labor: 
Rethinking 
Beauty 
Politics 
in 
Neoliberalism,” 
aesthetic labor is the privilege 
that women have to take 
ownership over their beauty 
routines. It is more than just 
some Glossier Boy Brow or 
Covergirl mascara. It is the 
process, the labor of beauty 
as a whole. From a young age, 
girls are exposed to the world 
of cosmetics and expected 
to uphold societal norms by 
taking ownership over their 
routines in terms of their 
cosmetic choices and steps of 
their routines. In theory, this 
ability to build a routine seems 
easy, breezy and beautiful, 
but in a culture so heavily 
focused on self-improvement, 
the dedication to aesthetic 
labor 
becomes 
more 
than 
just a minute-long Instagram 
video, but a full-time job. 
A full-time job that, once it 
starts, the constant buzzing 
of 
beauty 
blogs, 
videos, 
channels, tutorials, magazine 
editorials, new and improved 
product lines, makes it nearly 
impossible to let go.
As more and more women, 
and young girls especially, 
dedicate themselves to the 
burden 
that 
is 
aesthetic 
labor, the link between the 
pressure to uphold aesthetic 
labor and femininity becomes 
ever-present. 
With 
the 
constant watchful eye of DIY 
culture and social constructs 
reminding us that there are 
never enough changes we can 
make to our appearances to 
achieve true beauty, aesthetic 
labor 
suddenly 
becomes 
a 
crucial aspect of a woman’s 
femininity. In other words, to 
be a woman is to be an aesthetic 

laborer, a hunter for the latest 
and 
greatest, 
an 
upholder 
of routine, a user of the best 
products. The only problem? 
To 
be 
the 
best 
aesthetic 
laborer is to be inhuman. It is 
practically impossible to keep 
up with DIY culture, to obtain 
the perfect routine. Yet women 
are deemed less feminine for 
failing to put enough work 
into their routines, and for 
not 
taking 
ownership 
and 
bettering their appearances, 
because as society likes to 
remind us, we are never good 
enough 
and 
cannot 
make 
enough changes and choices to 
our beauty regimes to embody 
perfection. And this, this is 
where the vicious cycle starts 
all over again.
Especially 
with 
the 
emergence of Instagram as a 
platform of social media, the 
feeling to aspire for a perfectly 
effortless routine and lifestyle 
is 
ever 
present. 
Countless 
profiles 
saturate 
Instagram 
with 
regular 
postings 
of 
photos and videos of products, 
various makeup looks and just 
the day-to-day lives of the 
account owners. With so many 
of these accounts on one’s feed, 

it is nearly impossible for viewers 
to escape the constant reel of 
content and comparison from 
these accounts. Account owner 
Huda Kattan runs @hudabeauty, 
a page featuring tips for all 
things cosmetics, with regular 
video 
routines 
showing 
extensive 
contouring, 
fake 
lashes, bright eyeshadow and 
skincare techniques, to name 
a few. Kattan also regularly 
posts photos of her extensive 
makeup 
collection, 
packed 
with name brand products 
conveniently laid out on her 
Louis Vuitton makeup bag.
In theory and on paper, 
it seems obscene that a few 
photos and videos could hold 
so much weight in society for 
women ascribing themselves 

to the philosophy of aesthetic 
labor. But in a world revolving 
so much around materialism 
and 
looks, 
aesthetic 
labor 
thrives on the social media 
scene’s 
overwhelming 

properties. Because aesthetic 
labor is always changing, it 
preaches for us to find the 
latest and greatest, to always 
assume that we can be better. 
So naturally, following one 
beauty 
Instagram 
account 
simply will not do. To keep up 
we follow not only our favorite 
blogger’s 
pages 
but 
also 
brands like Benefit Cosmetics, 
Glossier, 
Lush 
Cosmetics 
and Birchbox, adding up to 
a large percentage of daily 
Instagram 
scrolls 
to 
be 
overtaken by routines, new 
products and more photos of 
Kattan’s perfectly contoured 
face, Glossier’s perfect new 
packaging for Coconut Balm 
and 
Rihanna 
effortlessly 
glowing while explaining her 
10-Minute Guide to Going Out 
Makeup for Vogue.
Although all different in 
exteriors and makeup choices, 
what 
unites 
these 
women 
and accounts is how they are 
socially constructed. Because 
Kattan has a specific routine 
including her own makeup 
brand, because the women 
on 
Glossier’s 
account 
are 
incorporating 
Cloud 
Paint 
and Lash Slick into their 
looks, because Rihanna has a 
different routine for going out 
than day to day, they are all 
considered feminine. These 
women are working to better 
themselves, their appearances, 
they are laboring working to fix 
the flaws society has told them 
that they have, yet making it 
look effortless. And for that, 
they 
are 
considered 
truly 
feminine women. They are 
trying new products, keeping 
up with what’s on trend in the 
cosmetics world and posting 
about 
the 
labor 
they 
are 
putting into their routines. 
And for what in return? For all 
this work, society deems this 
body of women to be beautiful.
The only issue with this 
is that the aesthetic labor 
portrayed 
through 
social 
media especially is so far 
from effortless. And while 
the videos, posts and brands 
make it seem as though it’s 
OK to have a routine unique 
to yourself, there are always 
consequences. Whether you’re 
wearing too much makeup, not 
enough or if you’re not up to 
speed on the latest cosmetics 
trends, there is literally no 
right answer. Yet, as women, 
we are still expected to work 
away at our routines and 
appearances, to be aesthetic 
laborers 
and 
neoliberals, 
because this is what it means 
to be feminine. With social 
media as our overseer and 
constant reminder that there 
is always something more to 
strive for, the vicious cycle of 
dedication to aesthetic labor 
never ends. It is as unending 
as it is unrealistic, something 
that we as women may never 
exactly know what it means, as 
we curate our Instagram feeds, 
purchase our Glossier and stay 
in the know on cosmetic blogs, 
all completely unsure of just 
how far from easy, breezy and 
beautiful this lifestyle is.

Aesthetic labor and the 
changing of femininity

MARGERET SHERIDAN
Daily Arts Writer

GLOSSIER

STYLE NOTEBOOK

As more and 

more women, 

and young 

girls especially, 

dedicate 

themselves 

to the burden 

that is aesthetic 

labor, the link 

between the 

pressure to uphold 

aesthetic labor 

and femininity 

becomes ever-

present

When Michael Cera first 
burst onto the scene almost 
two decades ago, he played 
almost exclusively nerdy and 
whiny, nasal-voiced dweebs. No 
character better encapsulates 
this than George Michael Bluth 
from “Arrested Development.” 
I have a firm belief that you can 
trace the entirety of Michael 
Cera’s career as an almost direct 
parallel to how the character of 
George Michael is portrayed. 
Cera has gone from the pedestal 
of innocence, to the embodiment 
of strangely dickish and cool, 
to a young man-child who has 
perhaps overstayed his welcome 
and now it’s not entirely clear 
what is next for him. 
In 
the 
early 
days 
of 
Michael Cera and “Arrested 
Development,” 
both 
were 
quirky, well-loved and a wee 
bit indie. Cera went on to star 
in “Superbad,” “Scott Pilgrim 
v. the World” and a number of 
other popular comedies, his 
celebrity status slowly rising. 
Simultaneously, Jason Bateman, 
Will Arnett, Mae Whitman and 
other “Arrested” alumni began 
to make it big in multiple facets 
of the entertainment industry. 
Netflix users discovered and 

binged the early seasons of 
“Arrested Development” and 
clamoring for a revival slowly 
reached a fever pitch.
It’s 
2013. 
“Arrested 
Development” returns in a new 
format with a new Michael 
Cera. In the intervening years 
since the show went off the air, 
Cera had grown up and become 
“cool,” appearing as a parody of 
himself in the raunchy comedy 
“This is the End” and redefining 
the role of George Michael Bluth 
as a suave (but still bumbling) 
college 
student 
who’s 
now 
knocking 
up 
his 
Euro-zone 
hookup and sleeping with a 
woman who’s also dating his 
father. This version of George 
Michael still has the youthful 
charm of young Michael Cera but 
now also includes the irony of 
the fact that that youthful charm 
has now slightly grown up. 
This is the transitional Michael 
Cera, the liminal Michael Cera, 
the Michael Cera that you still 
trust despite some feeling deep 
within your soul telling you 
that doing so is a huge mistake. 
This 
version 
of 
“Arrested 
Development” 
was 
similar. 
Some loved it, some didn’t, most 
people shrugged their shoulders 
and said, “Hopefully next time it 
will be better.” 
Cut to 2018. Michael Cera 
is now bordering age 30 and 

appearing 
in 
Aaron 
Sorkin 
movies 
as 
Tobey 
Maguire. 
“Arrested 
Development” 
is 
back for another go around 
except this time it is mired 
in 
controversy 
surrounding 
Jeffrey Tambor’s alleged sexual 
misconduct and the male cast 
bumbles their way through one 
of the cringiest New York Times 
interviews in recent memory. 
Everything from “Twin Peaks” 
to “Roseanne” to “The Last Man 
Standing” is getting revived. 
Donald Trump is President. The 
days of pining over new episodes 
of “Arrested Development” are 
a distant memory. If anything, 
most fans of the original show 
are now helplessly hoping they 
never have to watch Jessica 
Walters break down in an 
interview because of the way 
her co-stars are acting ever 
again. Michael Cera being in 
love with his cousin just isn’t 
funny anymore, not when both 
are old enough to have kids of 
their own. This is the final stage 
of Michael Cera. The moment 
when the bitter taste of nostalgia 
comes back to bite you in the ass 
and leaves you wondering what 
it will be like when a 70-year-
old Michael Cera is hitting on 
a similarly aged woman who’s 
been rejecting his advances since 
they were 11. Still laughing? I 
sure hope not.

The Michigan Daily Top 10 Poll 

Each week, Daily sports staffers fill out ballots, with first-place 
votes receiving 10 points, second-place votes receiving nine and 
so on. 

1. Alabama: Ugh.

2. Georgia: Sick of these SEC schools 
scheduling cupcake games against teams 
like Vanderbilt.

3. Ohio State: Haskins directly translates 
to “has families.” We prefer loyalty to 
one family.

4. Notre Dame: Old Dominion vs. Notre 
Dame is gonna be a great playoff match-
up.

5. Clemson: Big bye week coming up for 
Clemson to get Kelly Bryant back and 
healthy for the rest of the season.

6. West Virginia: *Checks schedule* 
Oh yeah, Iowa State is gonna beat them 
somehow.

7. Washington: A 7-point win over UCLA 
is actually a loss. Sorry, we don’t make 
the rules.

8. Penn State: Congrats to James Frank-
lin, who likely took a huge moral stand 
after his team’s win over the bye week.

9. Texas: The Burnt Orange River Shoot-
out, imo.

10. LSU: Crazy that the Tigers finally 
have a quarterback and still lost a big 
game.

Paige Jones’ serve powers ‘M’ past Purdue

Paige Jones has found a new 
home inside Cliff Keen Arena. 
Hailing 
from 
New 
Bremen, 
Ohio — a 158-mile drive from 
Ann Arbor — Michigan’s 6-foot-
1 freshman outside hitter has 
dazzled all season long.
In her debut campaign, she 
has already notched 175 kills, 
108 digs, and 12 blocks in the 55 
sets she’s played. Perhaps even 
more impressive, her 22 service 
aces mark a team high. Jones is 
the only Michigan starter with 
a jump serve — a technique in 
volleyball where the player adds 
power and height to their serve by 
using a leaping approach to strike 
the ball. The jump serve is no easy 
feat; the fact that the ball must 
travel 30 feet from the service 
line to the net and cross above the 
7-foot-4 height of the tape makes 
the skill tough to master.
The Wolverines (15-2 overall, 
4-2 Big Ten), ranked No. 16 in 
the AVCA Coaches Poll, relied 
on Jones’ jump serve throughout 

the match to power them past No. 
14 Purdue (14-3, 3-3) on Friday 
in front of a packed Cliff Keen 
Arena. Jones stepped up when 
she was called upon, delivering 
a staggering five aces en route 
to Michigan’s 25-15, 25-16, 25-14 
sweep of the Boilermakers.
“Paige has been working hard 
on 
that 
serve 
— 
she 
hasn’t 
done it since her 
junior year of 
high school until 
this 
season,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mark 
Rosen. 
“When 
we played Penn 
State, they had 
a jump server 
who was ripping 
it, and I think her seeing another 
jump server who was ripping it 
was the best thing for her. She’s 
been trying to get comfortable 
with it, so she hasn’t really been 
bringing the pace that we’d like, 
but tonight she came blasting it.”
Added junior opposite Sydney 
Wetterstrom with a smile and a 

chuckle: “I’m glad she can serve it 
like that, because I tried it and it 
was not successful.” 
Jones’ serve swings momentum 
in Michigan’s favor when it 
needs it most. Her five-point 
service run in the first set put the 
Wolverines ahead for good. The 
run started with a bang — Jones 
gave Michigan a 
12-5 
lead 
when 
she 
unleashed 
a 
missile 
from 
the service line 
that bounced at 
the feet of the 
opposing 
libero 
after 
Purdue’s 
first 
timeout. 
Following 
the 
clean ace, the six 
Wolverines on the 
court threw their arms into the 
air and embraced each other in a 
huddle at the center of the court. 
When asked about the impact 
Jones’ serve has on Michigan’s 
entire approach, Rosen praised 
his freshman.
“We really need her serve,” 
Rosen said. “She’s going to be a 

bit more prone to error than other 
servers but I’m okay with that. 
Tonight she was really bringing 
it and certainly got into a good 
groove.”
Jones comes from a family tree 
full of athletes — her father played 
college basketball, her mother 
ran track, and both her older 
sisters play collegiate volleyball. 
Growing up, Paige competed in a 
trio of sports that kept her busy 
year-round before electing to 
focus on volleyball at Michigan.
“Paige was a three sport 
athlete from a really small town 
in Ohio who played basketball 
and ran track in addition to high 
school volleyball,” Rosen said. 
“She wasn’t a big name coming in, 
but we’ve known about her for a 
while. Those three sport athletes 
are a bit of a dying breed, which 
kept her off the national radar.”
With the Wolverines surging 
in the AVCA Coaches Poll, Jones 
has put her talents on full display. 
Once Michigan volleyball fans 
familiarize themselves with her, 
they’ll see exactly why her serve 
is the key to Michigan’s success.

Freshman outside hitter Paige Jones used her newly-developed jump serve to help Michigan power past Purdue in straight sets on Friday night.

“She’s been 
trying to get 
comfortable 
with it.”

A victory marked by kills and comebacks

Spurts of intense cheering 
followed by bouts of focused 
silence characterized a thrilling 
fifth set that saw six lead changes 
and eight ties. 
The crowd couldn’t help it. 
It was the first five-set match 
the No. 16 Michigan volleyball 
team played all season. Despite 
an early three-
point 
deficit, 
the 
Wolverines 
clawed their way 
out thanks to a 
service ace from 
junior 
setter 
MacKenzi Welsh 
and 
kills 
from 
freshman outside 
hitter Paige Jones, 
junior 
outside 
hitter 
Sydney 
Wetterstrom and senior outside 
hitter Carly Skjodt. 
Michigan took the lead, but 
the teams fought a back and forth 
battle. Indiana then regained 
some momentum and scored 
three of the next four points, 
bringing the game to match point. 
But, the Wolverines prevented 
one match point on account 
of Skjodt’s kills and persisted 
through another after a Hoosier 
attack error was held up after 
review. 
Then 
it 
happened 
again. 
Another kill from Skjodt coupled 
with an Indiana attack error gave 
Michigan the victory, 16-14. 
“I would like to set Carly as 
much as I can,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “That was 
certainly the game plan. At the 
end we made sure that was our 
game plan; she’s our senior.”
Skjodt effectively bolstered the 
Wolverines’ offense, achieving 
a career-high 71 swings and 
committing only four errors 
while hitting .352 en route to her 
personal-best 29 kill total that 
included six kills in the deciding 
set. And to top off the career 

night, she added 10 digs for the 
20th double-double of her career.
Indiana started the first set 
strong with a 3-0 run, which 
Michigan countered with its own 
four-point run. Still, no team 
gained an advantage, until a 5-1 
run allowed the Hoosiers to take 
a three-point lead. Indiana then 
quickly gained an additional 
point — emphasizing its new edge. 
The Wolverines called a timeout. 
Even 
with 
10 
kills 
from 
Skjodt in this 
set, Michigan’s 
.082 
hitting 
percentage 
could 
not 
combat 
the 
Hoosiers fierce 
momentum. 
Indiana won the 
first set, 25-19. 
Between 
the first and second sets, the 
Wolverines appeared to find their 
stride and momentum. They 
opened with a carefully balanced 
offensive attack comprised of a 
.351 team hitting percentage that 
stems from kills mounted by a 

variety of players, such as Jones, 
Welsh, Skjodt and sophomore 
middle back Kiara Shannon. 
Following a kill by Wetterstrom 
paired with a Hoosier attack 
error, Michigan secured a lead, 
which it held for the rest of the 
set. The Wolverines won the 
second set, 25-19.
Indiana came back in the 
third set with a fraction of 
its 
momentum. 
Though 
the 
Hoosiers 
jumped 
out to an early lead, 
they soon fell prey 
to a serving streak 
from Skjodt and 
a series of attack 
errors. 
Michigan 
enjoyed this lead 
for a time, but 
Indiana 
worked 
from behind and 
regained its former 
lead. In response, 
the Wolverines called a timeout. 
After the timeout, freshman 
middle back Kayla Bair fired up 
the team with a kill succeeded 
by three more during a 10-2 run 
that allowed Michigan to take the 
third set. 

This fiery spirit persisted into 
the fourth set. The Wolverines 
consistently maintained a four-
point lead. Despite this, Indiana 
managed to cut the gap, rack 
up four points in a row and take 
the lead. Michigan attempted a 
comeback, but Hoosier Breana 
Edwards closed the game with 
three kills. This play sent the 
Wolverines and Hoosiers into a 
thrilling fifth set. 
The 
crowd, 
stunned 
by 
Indiana’s 
comeback, 
cheered 
nervously 
as 
they 
prepared 
themselves 
for the game-
deciding 
set 
ahead. 
But 
the 
Wolverines, led 
by Skjodt, made sure the crowd 
went home happy. 
“These guys competed really 
well,” Rosen said. “You know, 
when the match was on the line 
and we needed big points, we 
came through.”

Michigan bounces back, 
sweeps the Boilermakers

How do you bounce back from 
the toughest loss of the season in 
one of the most highly-anticipated 
matches of this year?
The No. 16 Michigan volleyball 
team (3-2 Big Ten, 14-2 overall) 
answered 
that 
question 
in 
resounding fashion on Friday night, 
grabbing a dominant, straight-set 
home victory over No. 14 Purdue 
(2-3, 13-3), 25-15, 25-16 and 25-14. 
The win over the Boilermakers 
came just five days after the 
Wolverines were handed their 
first home defeat of the season, a 
straight-set loss to No. 9 Penn State.
Playing 
in 
the 
familiar 
compounds of Cliff Keen Arena, 
Michigan jumped on Purdue from 
the very beginning of the match 
and cruised to its first victory of the 
season against a ranked opponent. 
Some familiar faces led the way 
for the Wolverines on Friday night, 
with senior outside hitter Carly 
Skjodt and freshman outside hitter 
Paige Jones leading the team with 
11 kills each.
In addition, junior outside hitter 
Sydney Wetterstrom came up with 
arguably her best performance of 
the season, notching 10 kills on 12 
attempts for a sparkling .833 hitting 
percentage. The trio of Skjodt, 
Jones and Wetterstrom combined 
for 39.5 points on the day, 6.5 better 
than the team total of 33 for the 
Boilermakers.
“Cliff Keen is a place where we 
are able to work hard together, on 
and off the court,” Skjodt said. “The 
stands and the fans in the stands are 
a big part of that. They know when 
to get loud and rowdy, and they 
know when to pull it back a little bit. 
I think that’s one thing that really 
attracted me to this school, even 
while going through recruiting, was 
the fan base and how passionate 
they are to represent Michigan.”
As has happened time and time 
again, the defense came through 

with a dominating performance by 
stifling the Purdue attack early and 
never allowing it to gain any sort of 
point-scoring momentum.
The Wolverines came into the 
match ranked fifth in the country 
and second in the Big Ten in 
holding opponents to a .144 hitting 
percentage. They limited fifth-year 
senior outside hitter Sherridan 
Atkinson, who came into the match 
leading the Big Ten with 4.25 kills 
per set, to only three kills on 16 total 
attempts throughout the match 
for the Boilermakers. Senior libero 
Jenna Lerg once again spearheaded 
the defensive performance, pacing 
all players with 16 digs. Skjodt 
added another seven from her 
outside spot, and junior setter 
MacKenzi Welsh followed up with 
six of her own.
“We’re able to use the energy (of 
the home fans) and take that with 
us when we’re up by a lot. It was still 
fun to play, and we appreciate how 
the fans don’t get quiet when we’re 
well ahead, which allows us to keep 
rolling,” said Wetterstrom. “That’s 
part of what has made this year so 
much fun, and we’re hoping that it 
only continues.”
After losses to the first two 
ranked opponents that it faced in 
conference play, the victory on 
Friday night was a welcome sight 
for Michigan and its coaching staff.
“(After the Penn State match), 
the girls were pointing out in the 
locker room that ‘we need to be 
better in these areas.’ They were 
solution-minded, 
and 
I 
think 
when anyone can do that, they’re 
moving in the right direction,” 
said Michigan coach Mike Rosen. 
“(Associate 
head 
coach 
Leisa 
Rosen) did a great job of putting 
them in pressure situations this 
week in practice, which helped us 
for this match.
“This is a talented team, and 
these guys believe that, which was 
a big key for us this week, and it will 
remain that way for the rest of the 
season.”

Zach Gentry looks for his next step after career day against Maryland

Can you compare Zach Gentry 
to New England Patriots’ tight 
end Rob Gronkowski?
Junior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson thinks so, and he did 
exactly that on Saturday. Gentry 
would prefer you not.
“I mean, stature maybe,” 
Gentry 
says 
with 
careful 
consideration. “He’s gonna go 
down as one of the best tight 
ends ever. Pretty lofty, but maybe 
there 
are 
some 
similarities 
athletically. I appreciate what 
(Patterson) said.”
Added junior WILL Devin 
Gil: “He knows tricks to get by 
you or get underneath you. I feel 
like he’s a talented, unique tight 
end.”
Comparisons 
aside, 
the 
redshirt junior tight end is 

continuing to prove his worth 
for the Michigan football team 
this season and hoping to land 
on an NFL draft board. But 
he’s still receiving looks. Dane 
Brugler, an NFL draft analyst 
for The Athletic, ranked Gentry 
as the No. 5 draft-eligible tight 
end for 2019.
Saturday against Maryland, 
Gentry 
provided 
merit 
to 
that assessment. The 6-foot-8 
Gentry set career highs in both 
receptions (seven) and receiving 
yards (112) acting as the primary 
receiver. Through six games, 
Gentry leads the Wolverines in 
receptions (20) and yards (306), 
and after the game, Harbaugh 
listed every attribute that came 
to mind.
“Yeah, 
he’s 
progressing 
well,” Harbaugh said. “To have 
everything you want from a 
tight end — being able to block, 

being able to catch, being able to 
create separation, make a tough 
catch, has the big catch radius, 
in-line 
blocking, 
in-space 
blocking. He’s got the speed that 
you’d like to see, the athleticism 
you’d like to see.”
The amalgam 
of it all is a 
dependable 
tight end. When 
Patterson 
faced 
pressure, 
throwing 
to 
Gentry was the 
theme.
But Gentry is 
far from perfect. 
Harbaugh 
already knows what else he 
wants to see from him.
“The thing that’s probably the 
next thing for him ... is yards-
after-catch,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“Get the ball and create those 
yards-after-catch. But I think 

that will come. Everything he’s 
done as a player has improved, 
developed, the next thing he’s 
attacked he’s grown and gotten 
really proficient in. I think 
that’s the best place for growth 
for 
him 
as 
a 
player.”
Added 
Gentry: “Maybe 
getting a little 
bit better vision 
and trusting my 
blocking 
a 
bit 
more downfield. 
I 
agree 
with 
that, I think that 
catching the ball 
and being able 
to turn it upfield is something I 
need to work on.”
This deficiency in his game 
was readily apparent with two 
minutes remaining in the second 
quarter of Saturday’s game. 
Gentry stepped out of a block 

for a screen pass, and caught 
a throw with sophomore wide 
receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones 
and three offensive lineman 
forming a wall of blockers in 
front of him. Instead of charging 
behind their blocks, Gentry 
side-stepped 
inside, 
away 
from them and into a slew of 
Terrapin defenders, shortening 
a potential long-yardage gain to 
just seven yards.
According 
to 
Gentry’s 
counterpart, junior tight end 
Sean 
McKeon, 
yards-after-
catch (YAC) drills are a skill 
that the two have worked on.
“We have YAC drills, we have 
stiff arms, just getting up field 
quick,” McKeon said. “As a tight 
end, you’re not gonna juke a lot 
of people, being like 260 pounds. 
Really just trying to be physical, 
lower the shoulder, stiff arm 
someone.”
There is no time like the 

present to improve post-catch 
routes, but Gentry, while still 
shuffling through the nuances 
of the tight end position, spent 
the 
offseason 
just 
focusing 
on catching the ball. He and 
McKeon ran routes, worked on 
timing with the quarterbacks 
and 
practicde 
bare-handed 
grabs with a JUGS machine 
firing high-speed footballs at 
them.
The outcome of their work is 
evident so far, and continuing to 
elevate his route-running could 
further involve Gentry in the 
NFL discussion.
But don’t mention the pros 
yet. Gentry’s mind is on other 
things at the moment.
“It’s obviously something I 
want to be a part of some day,” 
he said. “But (I don’t think) a 
whole lot right now (about the 
NFL). Got so much school and 
Wisconsin to watch.”

‘M’ offense embraces new attitude

When the Michigan football 
team beat Nebraska on Sept. 22, its 
defense said it felt the Cornhuskers 
quit — like they couldn’t compete 
with the Wolverines and they knew 
it.
That helped explain Michigan’s 
suffocation of Nebraska, holding it 
to 132 yards of offense.
But the sentiment holds true 
for the Wolverines’ offense too, 
according to junior guard Ben 
Bredeson. Monday at Michigan’s 
media availability, he said the 
difference between this season’s 
offensive line and last season’s is a 
killer instinct. When an opponent 
is pushed to its breaking point, the 
Wolverines’ front five gives the 
extra effort to break them.
“You can tell when they’re 
starting to get tired, or when they’re 
starting to give out and you just 
gotta push harder for just a little bit 
more, and sometimes it’s just getting 
one or two more touchdowns on 
them and then they can start to give 
in,” Bredeson said. “You know, some 
of the issues last year were we’d get 
to that point, and people would feel 
it and kind of lax up. You know, the 
other team would score. They’d 
get back into the game a little bit. 
But this year we’re not letting that 
happen, and it’s paying off for us.”

It isn’t just that to Bredeson, 
though.
The variety of weapons Michigan 
has on offense compared to last 
season has allowed it to “let loose” 
and “make plays.”
“I think (the mindset has been 
present) since the first game and 
especially these last few weeks, it’s 
just, football’s a fun game. Play it 
with a smile on your face,” Bredeson 
said. “And it’s fun to win, so if you 
can let loose, make plays and win, 
that’s a good feeling. That’s what 
we’ve been going for as a team and 
especially on offense.”
But what exactly does that look 
like?
One 
example 
is 
sophomore 
fullback Ben Mason’s hurdle in 
Saturday’s game against Maryland. 
Another is sophomore quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson’s 
play-making 
ability, constantly scrambling and 
throwing on the run, providing 
a well-documented spark to the 
Wolverines’ offense.
For the offensive line, it isn’t 
so obvious. Obviously they aren’t 
hurdling 
anybody 
or 
scoring 
touchdowns.
“It’s just playing hard for us, 
really, is what we can get down to,” 
Bredeson said. “And then just being 
emotional. You know, when you 
score, it’s a good thing. Cheer, go 
celebrate with everybody. I feel like 
sometimes — this happens to me too 

— you get into the battle rhythm of 
the game. You score, you smile, you 
run off, you do it again. But it’s just 
important to remember that it’s a 
game. Have fun, go celebrate with 
your guys when you score.”
To the outside eye, Michigan’s 
defense has played the ostentatious 
role for the last few years. Whether 
it be former VIPER Jabrill Peppers 
or current players like junior 
linebacker Devin Bush, it would be 
hard to accuse the defense of not 
having enough fun.
It’s a unit that flies around 
the ball, makes plays, celebrates 
accordingly then lines up to do 
it again. Maybe that’s why the 
Wolverines have been first in the 
nation in total defense this season 
— the same spot they finished last 
year.
If that’s the case, and if that 
attitude has leaked into the offense, 
it can only mean good things for 
Michigan.
“They’ve been playing together,” 
Bush said. “You can tell they’ve 
been having a lot of fun out there 
together and competing. You can 
see it on film and it shows up on 
gameday.
“… 
That’s 
been 
something 
(Wolverines coach Jim Harbaugh) 
has always been preaching, and I’m 
sure the guys bought into it more 
and more as they see more success 
come.”
