STUDENT GOVERNMENT
MSAto
change
name in
January
r With regents'
approval, name will
be Central Student
Government
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
The name "Michigan Student
Assembly" will become a relic come
January, when the governing body
will change its name for the first
time since 1976 to the Central Stu-
dent Government.
MSA President DeAndree Wat-
son said MSA will change its name
in January to dispel confusion, as
many students are unaware that
the Michigan Student Assembly is
the main student governing body at
the University.
"The first question we always
get from the students is, 'What is
(MSA?),' " Watson said.
The name change will "help stu-
dents better understand who we
are and the role we serve on cam-
pus," he added.
One of the main reasons for the
change is that the word "Assem-
bly" does not accurately reflect the
current structure of MSA, Watson
said. Previously, there was only one
central assembly meeting that all
members would attend. But under
the All-Campus Constitution, which
was revised last year, there is a sepa-
ration of powers with two houses of
the legislature and a distinct execu-
tive branch.

chancellor to get 'U' degree

Greg O'Dell to
return to previous
position at EMU
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily News Editor
Greg O'Dell, the chief of police
of the University's Department,
of Public Safety, announced
yesterday that he is leaving DPS
three months
after he took
the position
to return to
his previ-
ous job as r
director of
public safety
and chief
of police O'DELL
at Eastern
Michigan University.
O'Dell, who left EMU in
August to become the chief of
DPS, has resigned effective
today. O'Dell will rejoin EMU
next month and replace the
current interim chief who has
served in O'Dell's place since he
left EMU. The Eastern Michi-
gan University Board of Regents
must approve the hiring before
O'Dell can officially return to
the position.
O'Dell notified University
officials on Tuesday of his deci-
sion to resign, which he said was
a "strictly personal decision."

"I have nothing bad to say
about Michigan. I love Michi-
gan and I enjoyed working with
the people there," O'Dell said in
an interview with The Michigan
Daily today. "I just felt for me
personally, it was a better fit for
me to return to the job that I had
at Eastern."
He said a major factor in
deciding to return to EMU was
regaining the ability to continue
developing past initiatives and
ptograms he worked on during
his three and a half years at the
school.
"These are very tough deci-
sions to make, and it did come
down to that I thought this
would be the right decision for
me because I was so invested in
the changes that had happened
at Eastern."
Hank Baier, the University's
associate vice president for
facilities and operations, said
the University regrets having to
let O'Dell leave the University.
"I have known Greg for many
years, and I am truly sorry to
say he came to the decision that
U-M was not the right fit for
him," Baier said in a statement.
O'Dell's new salary at EMU
will be $149,000 - $20,000 less
than what he made before he
left to join DPS, according to an
EMU press release. O'Dell's sal-
ary at the University of Michi-
gan was $200,000, according

Attorney General
* Schuette opposes
GSRAs'unionizing

Vigil held in support of Calif. student protesters

Michigan AG says
p he will speak
out at Dec. 13
MERC meeting
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily Staff Reporter
With the intervention of
Michigan Attorney General Bill
Schuette, the plot has thickened
in the dispute over whether grad-
uate student research assistants
should be allowed to unionize.
Schuette filed a motion yester-
day stating his intent to intervene
at the Michigan Employment
Relations Commission's meeting
on Dec. 13 when the commission
. will determine whether or not
GSRAs will be allowed to hold
an election over unionization.
Previously, only those in favor
of unionization have been repre-
sented at the MERC meetings.

Schuette stated in the motion
that unionization could detract
from the University's ability to
attract the best students and
researchers. He added that at
least 19 current and former Uni-
versity deans support this stance
stating their opposition and cited
a letter they wrote to University
Provost Philip Hanlon this past
summer.
"Potential unionization will
compromise the integrity of
the mentor-mentee relation-
ship essential to a successful and
prestigious doctoral program,"
Schuette wrote in the motion.
"The imposition of (a union) into
the educational process could
make the University less attrac-
tive as a research institution."
Schuette said because the Uni-
versity receives state tax dollars,
the issue of GSRA unionization is
a matter of public interest, which
gives him the authority to.inter-
vene. A MERC ruling from 1981

Uncovering ancient Egpyt

What are your interests
in the subject of Egyptol-
ogy?
I study the history of
Egyptology itself as a disci-
pline. I study how Egyptolo-
gyhasbeen done -primarily
American Egyptology in the
19th and early 20th centu-
ries. I look at early Ameri-
can Egyptologists and how
they wrote their histories
of Egypt and why they-said
what they said.
What has been a favor-
ite archeological experi-
ence?
My favorite thing about
working in Egypt is that we
get to work with Egyptians

in the field. We work closely
with an Egyptian crew as
well as an American crew.
We get to meet Egyptians
and become their friends,
and the whole experience of
living and working in Egypt
is the best part of archeol-
ogy. These sites are really
beautiful.
Do you think the recent
political events in Egypt
will affect student inter-
est in Egyptology?
I hope that it will encour-
age people to think how
ancient Egypt relates to
modern Egypt. That's part
of what I study myself: how
ancient Egypt is relevant to,

or matters, in the modern
day. I hope it will encour-
age people to think about
Egypt as a whole instead of
just thinking about Egypt
as an ancient culture. I hope
they will look at it as a con-
tinuously occupied Egyptian
culture, and there is a lot
in modern Egyptian politi-
cal discourse that is equally
important as anything in the
ancient world.
What are some of the
values that learning the
history of Ancient Egypt
hasfor students?
The surface value is that
it's a culture that shows
up so frequently on TV, in

documentaries and what-
not. Often, students are very
interested in it,buttheydon't
know what's true or what's
not. It's great to see students
learn how to interpret televi-
sion shows, how to interpret
archeological evidence - to
be able to see for themselves
whether they should believe
or not what they see on TV.
At a deeper level, being able
to read a history book and
understand that what it's
telling you about history has
a certain agenda, certain
biases and there's meaning
in everything we say about
history.

A state House committee'

that would allow for more pub-

it could gain final passage by the

The Republican-led House
Education Committee voted
11-6, mostly along party lines, in

would end some numerical and
geographical limits on char-

Death of Florida
A&M drum major
believed to be
result of hazing
MIAMI (AP) - Two decades
ago, the now-ousted director of
the Florida A&M band warned in
a letter about the dangers of haz-
ing among the famed "Marching
100" ensemble, saying "it would
be very difficult for the univer-
sity and the band should someone
become killed or hurt."
In the following years, how-
ever, hazing seemed to become
a bigger - if not a more public -
problem. Police investigated sev-
eral serious cases and students
were arrested. Anti-hazing work-
shops were held. Dozens of band
members were suspended. Uni-
versity officials and the march-
ingband community were keenly
aware of the persistent hazing,
yet it continued and is believed
to have played a role in the death
this month of a 26-year-old drum
major, Robert Champion.
Champion's death started a
blame game of sorts, with the
historically black college in Tal-
lahassee firing its band director,
Julian White, accusing him of
"misconduct and/or incompe-
tence." In turn, White released
more than 150 pages of docu-
ments showing that he warned
the university for years about
what was going on.
The chair of the Board of Gov-
ernors, which oversees Florida's
public universities, wrote a letter
to FAMU trustees Tuesday saying
it would investigate whether the
university administration took
appropriate action to address
White's concerns.
A former band member told

The Associated Press on Tues-
day that White looked for ways to
eradicate a culture of hazing that
existed in many instrument sec-
tions of the band. White invited
band members to anonymously
report hazing and even had police
come along on some away games,
former drum major Timothy Bar-
ber told AP.
In 2001, trumpeter Marcus
Parker was paddled so severely
that he ended up hospitalized
with kidney damage. White had
police escort the trumpet section
off the field to be interrogated to
show he would not tolerate haz-
ing, Barber said.
About a dozen people pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor and
received probation in that case,
though it's not clear what actions,
if any, the university took to pun-
ish them.
After the arrests, White
approached Barber for help in
getting rid of hazing. One area
he focused on: A white wall in
the band's practice field where
nicknames for the instrument
sections were prominently dis-
played. Becoming a member of
these groups - the clarinets
were known as "The Clones"
and the tubas were the "White
Whales" - meant becoming part
of a tradition and a band that has
played Super Bowls, the Gram-
mys and presidential inaugura-
tions.
But some sections had their
own violent initiation rituals.
White bought buckets of white
paint and asked Barber to cover
up the section nicknames on the
wall.
"Tim, we have to find a way
to eradicate these subsections of
the band," Barber said White told
him. "Cover the names so they
see this is not somethingsupport-
ed by the band staff."

Three American
students arrested in
protests near Tahrir
Square last month
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -
Every year American colleges
and universities send more
than 270,000 students to study
abroad and more of them are
choosing unconventional des-
tinations, which in places like
Egypt can entice students to
ignore well-meaning warnings
from back home and plunge into
the political upheaval in the
streets.
"I think the temptation is
there, to wrap up in a keffiyeh
and try to look like any other

Egyptian revolutionary, to feel
a little exhilaration from a kind
of danger you don't get in Amer-
ica," said Wittney Dorn, 20, of
Appleton, Wis., who is studying
at the American University in
Cairo.
Universities have been repeat-
ing the importance of striking
the right balance between safety
and cultural immersion after the
Nov. 20 arrest of three Ameri-
can students during the protests
near Tahrir Square, the Cairo
roundabout that has been the
epicenter of the Jan. 25 uprising
against ousted President Hosni
Mubarak.
Dorn said in an email from
Cairo that she's been follow-
ing the advice she got from
both from American University
and her home college, St. Olaf

in Northfield, to avoid crowds,
political demonstrations and
Tahrir Square specifically. '
"It's not a brilliant idea to go
exploring an area where people
are being killed, despite how
tempting it may be to watch his-
tory unfold before one's eyes,"
Dorn wrote.
A survey earlier this month
from the nonprofit institute
of International Education
found more than 270,000 U.S.
students studied abroad dur-
ing the 2009-10 school year,
up about 4 percent from a year
earlier. Most went to western
Europe: Britain, Italy, Spain
and France. But the survey
found increasing numbers in
less traditional destinations;
Egypt, for example, hosted
1,923 Americans, up 8 percent.

U.S. lawmakers jobless population

against training
* Iraqi police force
Democrats and Republicans
are joining together in harshly
criticizing a State Department
program for training Iraq's police
force.
Lawmakers at House Foreign
Affairs ' subcommittee hearing
yesterday said it was a waste of
money to spend nearly $900 mil-
lion in the 2012 budget year on
Iraqi police training.
They cited an October report
from a U.S. government watch-
dog that said the training pro-
gram lacked focus, could become
a "bottomless pit" for U.S. dollars
and may not even be wanted by
the Iraqis.
That audit also found that only
about 12 percent of the money
actually will go to helping the
Iraqi police. It said most will pay
for security and other items such
as living quarters for trainers.
 VATICAN CITY
Pope seeks end to
death penalty
Pope Benedict XVI voiced
support yesterday for political
actions around the world aimed
at eliminating the death penalty,
reflecting his stance as an oppo-
nent of capital punishment.
He made the comments dur-
ing his weekly public audience
to participants at a meeting
being promoted by the Catholic
Sant'Egidio Community on the
theme "No Justice without Life."
He said he hopes "your deliber-
ationswill encourage the political
 and legislative initiatives being
promoted in a growing number of
countries to eliminate the death
penalty."
Benedict, like his predecessor
Pope John Paul II, has appealed
for commutation in a number of
 death penalty cases, many in the
United States.

near Saginaw. It's the fifth pol-
icy address of his first year in
office. Earlier speeches focused
on changes he wants to see in
education, local government,
health and wellness, and infra-
structure.
The new Talent Connect web-
site, which went live yesterday, is
designed to create a central hub

that can help new workers and
those trying to get back into the
job market assess their skills,
evaluate the return on invest-
ment for an education or train-
ing program, browse careers and
connect with mentors.
"It's really about creating a
website, a web environment,
where people can go through
and ... and find out good infor-
mation about connecting talent
with jobs and careers, and giv-
ing people better tools to build
their career on," Snyder told the
AP. "We have tens of thousands
of open positions in Michigan
and ... we're not necessarily
turning out people with the skill
sets to match up with those."
The governor's recommenda-
tions for developing talent are
aimed at lowering the state's
double-digit unemployment
rate. Although the resurgent
domestic auto industry is help-
ing Michigan add jobs faster
than many other states, it's tied
with Mississippi for the state's
third-highest jobless rate at 10.6
percent, behind only Nevada
and California.

(Ad)vocating consistency
AATA advertisement policy must be more clear
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Tuesday
against the Ann Arbor Transportation Authority on the
grounds of a free speech violation. Blaine Coleman, an Ann
Arbor resident and activist, wanted to publish anti-Israel advertise-
ments on the side of AATA buses. The ACLU contends that by refusing
Coleman's advertisement, the AATA is violating the First Amendment
right to free speech. The AATA should develop a consistent policy
regarding the content of its bus advertisements to avoid future issues.


It's a great honor, it's humbling and all those things:'

being awarded Big Ten Coach of the Year, as reported by The Michigan Daily yesterday.

Coleman sent AATA an e-mail in Decem-
ber 2010 inquiring if it would be possible to
purchase an ad on the side or back of the bus
that runs along State Street, South University
Avenue and North University, according to
AnnArbor.com. His proposed advertisement
stated, "Boycott Israel. Boycott Apartheid."
Coleman's request was denied by the AATA,
which cited a policy of accepting ads in "good
taste" and rejecting those that "scorn or ridi-
cule a person or group of persons." The suit
was filed and pointed to the vague nature of
the company's policy on advertisements.
Regardless of the content of the advertise-
ment, the issue lies in free speech and the con-
sistency of policy. The AATA is a public transit
system, and its decisions reflect on the city of
Ann Arbor. By allowing certain advertisements
to be placed on buses and denying Coleman's
attempt to express his views, the transporta-
tion authority appears to be picking and choos-
ing which viewpoints it wants its riders and the
city to see. A potentially unpopular opinion in
the community is still an opinion, and Coleman
has the right to speak his mind as much the
next Ann Arbor resident.
The AATA has allowed numerous contro-
versial advertisements to run in the past. Res-

idents of Ann Arbor have seen ads regarding
issues of race, religion and politics on buses
for years from organizations like New Life
Church and politicians like Margaret Con-
nors, a candidate for district court judge in
2008. Such examples indicate that the AATA
does not have a concrete policy regarding the
selection or refusal of advertisements.
The AATA has the right to choose what it
shows on the side of buses. These advertise-
ments can affect business and the way area
residents perceive the business. It is a legiti-
mate concern that people who see the adver-
tisement would associate the content with
the AATA and not strictly with the advertise-
ment purchaser. The company must developa
policy with clear guidelines as to what it will
and will not display on AATA buses. Consis-
tency in decision-making is crucial to being
fair and reasonable.
The AATA's current advertisement policy is
vague and has been pushed aside for past bus
advertisements. The AATA must understand
the risks it takes when choosing to publish a
potentially controversial advertisement. By
developing a clear-cut policy, the company
will be able to avoid future problems regard-
ing free speech.

y friends tell me they're
taking Economics 101
to gain some practi-
cal knowledge
about the field,
but I think they'd
learn more about
how people
make decisions
and respond
to incentives
by going to a
college party. ERIK
There, they TORENBERG
would see real
life cost-benefit
analyses - and few of them would
be rational, consistent or optimal, as
their textbooks assume.
I'm notsure if Nobel Prize winner
Daniel Kahneman conducted any of
his research at college parties, but
his new book, "Thinking, Fast and
Slow," in blurring the line between
psychology and economics, reveals
how unconscious biases lead people
to systematically make irrational,
sub-optimal decisions.
What Kahneman's book does is
invalidate the cold, calculating and
emotionless persona that economists
and policy makers have built insti-
tutions around. He says he hopes
that the vocabulary he outlines to
describe unconscious biases - the
halo effect, representative bias, illu-
sion of validity, to give just a few
examples - leads to more nuanced
conversations about human capital.
What his book doesn't do, unfor-
tunately, is help us correct these
systematic biases. Even Kahneman
himself still falls for the same biases
he's been studying for more than 40
years. The ancient maxim, "know
thyself," while important, is sim-
ply not enough to change behavior.
Being aware that we're susceptible
to priming, loss-aversion or the halo
effect doesn't mean we can avoid
them. Self-description, that's one
thing; self-correction, that's some-
thing else entirely.
Yet some economists, like Rich-
ard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, refuse
to settle for mere self-description.

Their book, "Nudge," proposes an
interesting premise: Helping our-
selves - changing habits, altering
unconscious biases - on our own
is very difficult. Our environments,
however, can give us nudges that can
compensate for these biases and help
us make better decisions.
For example, want to encourage
people to lose weight? Don't show
them how restaurants "prime" them
to overeat. Just have the salad bar
be the first thing they see in the
cafeteria. Want people to save more
money? Don't tell them why they're
overspending. Just default them into
a 401(k). Want students to have col-
lege aspirations? Don't merely show
them the statistics. Bring in real live
examples of people who've succeed-
ed and who've failedbecause of their
education choices.
Thaler and Sunstein call the
designing of incentives choice
architecture. The designs can be
institutional, but they can also be
personal. The application SelfCon-
trol, for instance, stops users from
spending too much time on the
Internet. The website Stickk helps
users "stick" to their goals by attach-
ing a variety of monetary incentives.
The community of Life Hackers, a
group that posts tips and "hacks" -
everyday time-saving cheats - to be
more productive, is so prolific that
they create life hacks to stop them-
selves from posting life hacks.
The applications and benefits of
choice architecture are most illumi-
nating, in my opinion, when applied
to the context of author David Foster
Wallace's speech, "This is Water."
Wallace states that what your edu-
cation really teaches you is not how
to think, but rather, what to think.
When you're shopping in the super-
market late at night, and you're lone-
ly, tired and hungry, the ability to
analyze classroom arguments isn't
going to save you. It's going to be up
to you to consciously choose to not
be angry, to not give other people a
hard time.
Choice architecture concedes that
controlling what to think is a daunt-

ing task. As humans, we are way more
influencedbyour environments than
we'd like to admit. So choice archi-
tecture aimsto reverse the approach.
Instead of merely encouraging peo-
ple to, well, overcome their systemat-
ic tendencies to make mistakes, let's
change their environments to help
them prevent themselves from mak-
ing these mistakes inthe first place.
Change your
world to change
your mind.
So at the supermarket, you won't
stress over finding groceries; you'll
have your template list and which
isles they're on readily available.
You'll shoot your must-send e-mails
just by speaking into your phone.
And if you're angry, your phone will
sense that and confirm that you still
want to send that passive-aggressive
message.
In effect, there are two differ-
ent sciences here. Kahneman's sci-
ence, the descriptive science, is
an extensive study of the system-
atic flaws our intuition commits.
Knowledge of this science, however,
is not enough to change behavior.
Choice architecture, the prescrip-
tive science, aims to fill the gap left
by descriptive science - to design
institutions and choice structures
that compensate for our biases and
help us make better decisions.
Kahneman has just compiled
more than 40 years of descriptive
science research. For prescriptive
science, Thaler and Sunstein's book
was just the beginning.
If Kahneman is like the Lewis and
Clark of the human mind, whoever
masters the prescriptive science will
be like Neil Armstrong.

Reconstruct capitalism


Make MSA relevant

You've seen pictures of the signs and ban-
ners at the globe-spanning Occupy protests:
Capitalism is crisis. Capitalism isn't working.
Abolish capitalism. Perhaps you've even held
a placard with a similar message at a local
Occupy event.
As we struggle to undo the lingering
damage of the 2008 financial crisis, it isn't
difficult to understand why hundreds of
thousands of people have taken their griev-
ances to the streets. Something is clearly
wrong with a system that rewards individual
recklessness with bailouts while sticking
those least able to pay with the bill.
But the problem is not capitalism itself.
Rather, it is capitalism's bastardized form
- often called cronyism, state capitalism or
corporatism - that is responsible for so many
ills attributed to the free market. Left to their
own devices, individuals acting in the free
market work together to provide the goods
and services that improve the lives of all,
whether rich or poor. Yet the market mecha-
nism, when corrupted, quickly and inevitably
becomes a facilitator of unbridled greed.
Of course, many do not find these claims
convincing. The dispute over the merit of
free markets has lasted centuries. And it is
not difficult to understand why the debate
endures today, for the question of capitalism
is not merely one of economics. It is a ques-
tion of how to structure our society.
Even many of capitalism's nominal support-
ers are reluctant to view capitalism as ideal or
moral; it is often treated as a "necessary evil,"
a messy system that is nevertheless better
than its alternatives. As the Occupy movement
brings the flaws of our supposedly laissez-faire

system into sharp focus, these weak justifica-
tions are looking ever more inadequate. Clear-
ly, supporters of capitalism need a deep, robust
argument if the free-market system is to sur-
vive the current economic crisis.
Tom Palmer is one man who can help make
the much-needed moral case for capitalism.
Palmer is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute
in Washington D.C. He is also the vice presi-
dent for international programs at the Atlas
Economic Research Foundation. For the past
three decades, Palmer has traveled the globe,
bringing the message of individual liberty to
some of the world's most oppressed peoples.
His journeys have taken him to the satellite
states of the former Soviet Union, across the
Middle East and throughout Asia, Africa and
Latin America.
Palmer brings a unique, global perspective
to the economic and social problems we are
facing here at home. The University's chap-
ter of College Libertarians is pleased to host
Palmer as he visits campus today, and we
would like to extend an invitation to attend
the talk to all members of the campus com-
munity. Whether you consider yourself a cap-
italist, a socialist or something in between,
we're sure you will find Palmer's presenta-
tion both enjoyable and educational.
Tom Palmer will be presenting a free talk
entitled "The Morality of Capitalism: Where
Occupy Wall Street Went Wrong" today,
from 7:30p.m. to 9:00 p.m. The location is
Forum Hall, Palmer Commons. A question-
and-answer session will follow.

'd like to present a challenge to
the Michigan Student Assem-
bly: Become relevant. In the
past few weeks
I've become
increasingly dis-
satisfied with
our student rep-
resentatives on
campus. The
organization has
been plagued by
a lack of produc- EAGHAN
tivity and rele- DAVIS
vance on campus
for years. After
numerous conversations with
friends, one of who is an MSA rep-
resentative, I'm still attempting to
understand the Assembly. At the end
of every conversation, the question I
continue to ask is "What does our
student government accomplish?"
I'd like to present students with a
challenge. Take five minutes out of
your day and see how students on
campus are being represented. Go to
MSA's website and see what our stu-
dent government has accomplished
in the past few months. I'm sure
you'll be as surprised as I am. This
semester, MSA has passed a dis-
mal amount of resolutions. I'm not
implying this is a change in behavior
from the past, but upon seeing the
docket of resolutions, I became dis-
mayed with MSA's ineffectiveness
and the organization's inability to
equate the needs of every University
student to representative action.
This semester, MSA's track record
is laughable. In October, MSA
attempted to pass a resolution call-
ing for the University to reconsider
its investments in British Petroleum,
Northrop Grumman, Monsanto, and

HanesBrands Inc. It failed. A reso-
lution to "reconsider investments"
in companies that have histories of
human rights and ecological abuses
(BP's Gulf oil spill, Hanes's use of
child labor) failed. An investigation
into divesting from companies with
questionable business practices
seems like a fairly simple and non-
controversial decision. Apparently,
it's not for our student government.
One of the most productive reso-
lutions the body has produced is
a resolution to support a $2.50 fee
increase for student legal services.
MSA has passed resolutions to sup-
port bills in the state House of Rep-
resentatives. (I'm sure politicians
in Lansing are chomping at the bit
to hear if their legislation received
MSA's stamp of approval.) Ina land-
mark development, MSA announced
yesterday that it would change its
name to the "Central Student Gov-
ernment" in an attempt to make the
organization more recognizable.
One of my personal favorites is a
resolution to support the Under the
Lights Tailgate before the Michi-
gan vs. Notre Dame game on Sept.
10. Though many of these legisla-
tive actions make sense, is it what
you'd like your student assembly to
be concerning itself with? Are there
not more pressing issues on campus?
Less than three weeks ago, this
year's round of MSA elections took
place. Only 7 percent of the student
body participated in electing our
student representatives. I'm not
going to preach about your civic
duty to vote in student elections.
Clearly, the percentage of students
who voted was dismal. Last year,
about 10 percent of the student body
elected MSA officials. But there

must be a reason why so few of our
peers vote. I'll make my reasonsvery
clear: I chose not to vote because I
believe Benjamin Franklin's senti-
ments on the definition of insanity. I
refuse to do the same thing over and
over and expect different results.
Yet, because of my stubbornness
and ignorance about the state of our
student government, I've silenced
my voice.
As University students, we
deserve an Assembly that is relevant
- that concerns itself with problems
on campus, not superfluous bureau-
cratic issues.
Only 7 percent
of students
voted this year.
In the context of my challenge to
MSA, I'm not using 'relevant' as a
snide way to poke fun at the assem-
bly's accomplishments - I mean
that the assembly has the ability
to be a democratic caucus for ideas
and concerns across campus. Why
have we as students allowed our
government to become an assem-
bly wrought in mediocrity? The
only way to change the way MSA
operates is through participation.
Next time there is an opportunity to
change a broken system, utilize it. I
know I will.

prevents students, including GSRAs, from
unionizing because they are not public
employees.
On May 19, the University Board of
Regents voted 6-2 to recognize GSRAs as
employees. At the time of the vote, Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman said she
did not agree with the regents' decision.
In his motion, Schuette wrote that
the regents'-decision will make it diffi-
cult for the MERC and an administrative
law judge, who would conduct the vote,
to oppose the position that GSRAs are
employees. According to Schuette, this is
another reason for his intervention.
Rackham student Stephen Raiman, a
representative of Students Against GSRA

Unionization, said the attorney general's
decision to intervene is a step in the right
direction.
"I think it's a very positive development
for us," Raiman said. "It's going to have
somebody representing our interests ... at
MERC and in court."
Raiman added that until this point, the
interests of his group have not been repre-
sented at the MERC, despite faculty sup-
port.
"Our voice has been taken from us by
the Board of Regents' vote to support
unionization," Raiman said.
A statement to The Michigan Daily
last night from the Graduate Employ-
ees' Organization stated that GEO will
"continue their effort to restore their
collective bargaining rights even as the
Attorney General attempts to delay or
prevent aunion election by filing a motion
to intervene."
In the motion, Schuette said it is the
attorney general's responsibility to guar-
antee that all pertinent information and
arguments are presented before the
0 MERC.
At the Dec. 13 MERC meeting in
Detroit, the committee will review two
action items. If the first item is approved,
a judge will decide on whether or not
GSRAs should hold avote on unionization.
The second item would deny the motion to
reconsider unionization.
The Michigan Student Assembly
passed a resolution on Nov. S in support
of the GSRAs' right to hold an election to
unionize.

MSA
From Page 1A
The two houses of the leg-
islature are called the Student
Assembly and the University
Council, which Watson said
causes confusion when people
say "assembly" since it is unclear
whether they are referring to
the Student Assembly or the
Michigan Student Assembly as
a whole. With the new name in
place, he said it will be easier to
know which group students are
referring to.
"It's confusing for even mem-
bers within MSA ... to under-
stand exactly which part of
the organization we're talking
about," Watson said.
The All-Campus Constitution
also does not include the name
"Michigan Student Assembly."
Instead, the document refers to
the governing body as the Cen-
tral Student Government. After
the constitution was revised in
March 2010, student govern-
ment representatives say they
intended to change the name
of the governing body to reflect
what's stated in the Constitu-
tion.

With the name change, the
student government also aims to
highlight the University Council,
a group of unelected delegates
acting as a second house in MSA
that draws members from MSA,
student governments of Uni-
versity schools and colleges and
the University Activities Center
- which plans a variety of stu-
dent events. Added into the All-
Campus Constitution in 2010,
the University Council hopes to
increase collaboration among
these groups.
Brendan Campbell, vice presi-
dent of MSA, said the group cre-
ated a website to help facilitate
the name change - www.msa.
umich.edu/newname - and
highlight some of MSA's recent
initiatives like the alteration of
MSA's funding system for stu-
dent organizations. Starting in
January, instead of applying for
funding by three designated
deadlines per semester, student
groups can apply, for funding
every week.
Campbellsaid the name change
has "received support from
everyone we've spoken with." He
added that the Division of Stu-
dent Affairs, E. Royster Harper,
the University's vice president

for student affairs, and Univer-
sity Dean of Students Laura Blake
Jones have been helpful in intro-
ducing the new name.
"We're hoping that we can use
this name change as an opportu-
nity to reconnect with the stu-
dents," Campbell said.
The student government's
new name needs formal approv-.
al by the University's Board of
Regents, but Watson said he
expects the name change to pass
at the next regents meeting on
Dec. 15.
Denise Ilitch, chair of the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents, said
the regents have not formally
discussed the issue, and, she
could not yet comment on the
likelihood of the name change
being approved.
"The student government is
up to the students," Ilitch said.
"If they, as a majority, show that
they can communicate their mis-
sion and message better with a
stronger name, then I'm all for
it."
The last time the student gov-
ernment changed its name was in
1976 when it became the Michi-
gan Student Assembly, replac-
ing its former name, the Student
Government Association.

his way home, LSA junior

Michael Yaari stopped on the
Diag to learn what the vigil was
about.
"I did not know that much
about what had gone in Cali-
fornia, but after listening to
these speeches and standing in
silence, I feel more passionate
about responsibility to speak
out as a student of this Univer-
sity," Yaari said. "They can-
not keep us quiet with pepper
spray. We cannot let that hap-
pen."
At the end of the vigil, Wil-
liams led the group to C.C.
Little for the first occupy
Michigan meeting where the
group officially declared the
formation of the University of
Michigan's Occupy branch and
set the agenda for future action.
Organizers plan to lead
peaceful protests on campus
against the cost of tuition and
corporations' influence on the
University. Potential locations
of protests include President
Mary Sue Coleman's front lawn
and the Ross School of Business.

night game, at the end, when it
looked like all was lost and we
scored that touchdown. The
sidelines just erupted it was just
incredible. And Ryan, who is a
very emotional guy, what hap-
pened was I was jumping around
and kind of shaking hands
and hugging people and I turn
around just in time to see him
coming at me.
So it was a sneak-attack chest
bump.
So he came at me to chest
bump me and I don't even know
if I got off the ground because
he kind of startled me. I'm there
in my coat and tie. Then I had
this big hulk of a football player
jumping at me.
So that week, somebody had
noticed this and asked him about
it. He basically said my chest
bumping was kind of rusty and
unimpressive. So the next time I
saw him, I said, 'Hey, I saw what
you said, and the next time, I
want you to know I'm practicing
and I'll be ready.'
So there have been two or
three magic moments this sea-
son, including at the end of the
Ohio game, where our eyes met
and pretty soon we went, 'Yeah,
it's time.' And I just want you to
know, I'm just worried I'm going
to hurt him.
I've got to be careful I don't
hurt him (laughs).

STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Twelve seasons since the
birth of the Michigan men's soc-
cer team, the program is going
in a different direction.
Michigan coach Steve Burns
announced his resignation on
Wednesday after 12 seasons
as head coach of the Wolver-
ines - that number is mislead-
ing, though, since Burns was
the Michigan club team's head
coach from 1992 until the pro-
gram earned varsity status in
2000.
"As a Michigan alum, I'm
proud of everything we've been
able to accomplish within the
soccer program," Burns said in
a statement released by the Ath-
letic Department.
"I will forever cherish the
relationships that I have devel-
oped over the past 12 years with
players, assistant coaches, sup-
port staff and fellow coaches
within the department. How-
ever, it's time for a new direc-
tion in my life and leadership for
Michigan soccer."
The team was notified of
Burns's resignation in a team
meeting on Wednesday.
"It's tough to digest at first,"
said redshirt junior goaltender
Tim Bergsma. "You don't real-
ly know how to take it. It was
quiet as everybody just wrapped
in their all the possibilities of
everything going on.
"We appreciate all he's done
for Michigan soccer, and we all
wish him the absolute best in all
he does."
Bergsma could not confirm
whether Burns was at the meet-
ing or if he told the team of his
resignation.
Burns compiled a 122-98-22
overall record during his tenure,
though the Wolverines were
coming off a 5-14-1 season and
first-round elimination in the
Big Ten Tournament.
"Our record wasn't what we
want and this year didn't go

Michiganmen's soccer coach Steve Burns announced his resignation on
Wednesday. In 2010, he led the Wolverines la the NCAA College Cup. -_-

how we hoped it would," Bergs-
ma said. "But that being said,
I can't speak on his behalf or
infer everything that went on
behind the scenes. I know he
loved this program and worked
really hard to get it to where it
was."
Burns brought soccer to the
forefront on campus in 2010
when his team, led by forwards
Justin Meram and Soony Saad,
christened the brand-new U-M
Soccer Complex with a pro-
gram-best 17-5-3 record, a Big
Ten Tournament title and a trip
to the NCAA College Cup.
But that season was only pos-
sible after Burns spearheaded a
campaign to build a stadium to
house both the men's and wom-
en's soccer teams in Ann Arbor.
Once he got that in 2010, players
came, fans came and so did the
wins.
Burns was named the NCAA
Division-I Coach of the Year by
FieldTurf and was a finalist for
the NSCAA National Coach of
the Year in 2010.
The Wolverines' downfall,
though, was their inability to
retain their star players. Meram
graduated and was drafted
in the first round of the MLS
SuperDraft by the Columbus
Crew. Saad - then only a fresh-

man - left following the season
and dabbled in European soc-
cer before being drafted by-thg.
Sporting KC of the MLSThe
final dagger was when stud
goaltender Chris Blais trans-
ferred to South Florida before
the 2011 season.
Expectations rose after the
College Cup run, but the bench
was depleted and Burns and
Michigan were unable to sus-
tain their success.
In total, Burns's 12 teams
produced 61 Academic All-Big
Ten honorees, 11 All-Big Ten
first-team nominations and 10
second-team all-conference
honors.
Three Wolverines - Saad,
Michael Holody and Knox Cam-
eron - were named NSCAA
All-Americans. Burns also won
back-to-back national champi-
onships with the club team in
1997-98.
"I've talked to a lot of alum-
ni, and everybody's all over the
board with it," Bergsma said.
"Everybody has that same feel-
ing that he's done a lot for this
program and we appreciate
everything he's done."
According to the Athletic
Department release, Michigan
will begin a search for Burns's
replacement immediately.

Terrapins dominate on the
glass, hand 'M' first defeat

Michigan freshman guard Trey Burke has taken his game to another level since he left the mainland for a Hawaii visit.
Ford calls Burke first-rounder

DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
A year ago, few would've
guessed that byguard Darius Mor-
ris would've generated enough
buzz to even consider entering the
2011 NBA Draft.
But not long after the Michi-
gan men's basketball team's loss
to Duke in the NCAA Tourna-
ment, Morris left the Wolverines.
By the time Morris was drafted
" in the second
round by the NOTEBOOK
Los Ange-
les Lakers, Wolverine fans had
already turned their attention to
Ohio's 2010 Mr. Basketball in Ohio
and the expected future of Michi-
gan basketball, point guard Trey
Burke.
But after the offense struggled
mightily in the Wolverines' first
three games, it looked like Burke
would need another year to grasp
the offense, ala Morris in 2009.
Then the freshman exploded
onto the national scene at the
Maui Invitational, with several
NBA general managers in atten-
dance, along with ESPN NBA
Draft analyst Chad Ford.
And if Ford's impression of
Burke holds up, Michigan may be
sent scrambling for another point
guard replacement next year.
"The more I watch him, the
" more I think, 'I can't see how this
guy doesn't play in the NBA,' "
Ford said in an exclusive inter-
view with The Michigan Daily
in Maui. "(Point guards) who are
going to have the athleticism and
the poise and the court demeanor
- I wouldn't be shocked at all if he
was a first-round pick this year."
Burke, a four-star prospect out
of Columbus, was considered a
late bloomer and until his per-
formance last week on national
television, he had yet to catch
the country's eye. But since visit-
ing Hawaii, Burke has shown a
maturity beyond his years. His
athletic drives to the baskets are
drawing all the attention, but his
most underrated attribute has
been his ball control - he's aver-
aging less than three turnovers
per game.
"I spend the start of my year

talking to our high school scout-
ing guys about who are the
freshmen to watch, who are one-
and-done candidates - he wasn't
mentioned," Ford said. "He was a
steady kid, not flashy like a lot of
the players can be. I think alot of
the scouting guys ... see that and
they say, 'He's not as good.'
"Well now when you see him
play that way in college, it's all
poise. He's unselfish, he's getting
people involved, he gets his own
shot, but he's not out there just pri-
marily looking for his own shot."
Though this year's draft is
already garnering talk of being
one the most talented, deepest
drafts in several years, Ford is
quick to point out that it's lacking
quality point guards, opening the
door for Burke.
"These sorts of players, pure
point guards like him, are one of
the hardest commodities to find
in the NBA," Ford said. "The thing
that I think is hard for people to
get their arms around about the
NBA Draft - because it's so differ-
ent than the NFL Draft - there's
five or six guys in a really good
draft that are going to be major
impact players on their team....
What you're really asking for most
of these guys is, can they be a rota-
tion player off the bench?
"One of the NBA GMs said to
me, 'Well look, think of the 30"
backup point guards in the NBA
and then look at him and what he
does and say, 'Could he do that?'
And I think the answer is yeah."
MORRIS MISTAKEN?: Last
year's draft was considered rela-
tively weak, giving Morris the
needed assurance that he'd be
a first-round selection if he left
Michigan. So when the Los Ange-
les native wasn't picked until
the second round - albeit by his
hometown favorite Lakers - fans
called Morris's decision a mistake.
Even Ford, who Morris sought
out for advice before declaring
for the draft, was surprised that
the guard left after his sophomore
year.
"He knew he was a borderline
first-round pick," Ford said. "I
think that he was getting some
bad information. Whenever you
have, in one ear, bad information

- but it's what you want to hear
- you tend to discount the good
information and go with the bad."
While the talk in Ann Arbor has
shifted to Burke, it could've been
Morris taking advantage of this
year's weak point guard class.
Had Morris come back this year
with improved shooting ability
and another year of coaching, his
stock would've risen considerably.
"I think myself, along with
a number of other people, were
pretty honest with him about
where (he was) and where he
could be if he went back to school
another year," Ford said. "There's
almost no point guards in this
draft. I think he would've went
considerably higher. I think we'd
be talking about Darius Morris
right now as a mid-first rounder,
maybe late-lottery pick."
Though he lost out on his
chance to be a first-rounder - and
the significant accompanying pay
raise - Ford won't call it a mis-
take.
"I hate to say that (was a mis-

MITCH OR MASON?: Incoming
f-eshman forward Mitch McGary,
ESPN.com's No. 2 recruit in the
country, has elevated Michigan
into the discussion of Final Four
contenders next year.
But because he went to prep
school for two years instead of
graduating high school on time,
he'd technically be eligible for
the upcoming NBA Draft.
"There was a lot of talk about
him flirting with coming to the
NBA," Ford said. "Obviously, it's
about athleticism and motor for
him.
"Whenever you get a player
with that size, that motor and the
athletic ability, that's a huge get
at the college level."
Ford compared McGary to
current Duke forward Mason
Plumlee. Plumlee was highly
recruited out of high school, but
the Blue Devil hasn't lived up to
expectations.

Michigan women's basket-
ball coach Kevin Borseth should
have knocked on wood before
commenting on the Wolverines'
outstanding rebounding ability.
Earlier this week, Borseth
said that Michigan (7-1) boxes
out its competitors with ease.
But against
No. 16 MICHIGAN 65
Maryland MARYLAND 74
(8-0), the
Wolverines were the ones boxed
out, and they fell to the Terra-
pins, 74-65.
"Rebounds really hurt us in
this game," said senior guard
Carmen Reynolds. "We reverted
back to our old ways."
Rebounds and transitions
caused the loss, as Michigan was
unable to keep up with Mary-
land's fast-acting offense and
quick reflexes on the boards.
"They had 51 rebounds, which
is over the top," Borseth. "That's
like a 36 ACT score. We couldn't
keep them off the glass."
But the Wolverines knew
it would be difficult to go up
against Maryland.
The Terrapins average 85
points per game and Michigan
averages 55, so Borseth devised a
plan to make up for the 30-point
difference. First, the Wolverines
would attempt to take 20 points
by stopping the Terrapins in
transition, and they would gain
10 points by outrebounding
them.
The plan worked in the first
half, as the Wolverines were able
to hold the Terrapins and the
score was tied at the half, 36-36.
But Maryland regrouped in the
second half and pulled away in
the last five minutes.
"Down to the five-minute
mark we were right there and
we got stuck on 59," Borseth
said. "They turned the defense
up at the five-minute mark and it
got really physical at that point.
They were a little more physical
than we were down the stretch."'
While Maryland had a leg up
on Michigan in athleticism, it
also had star sophomore forward
Alyssa Thomas, who scored 24

Senior Courtney Boylan, who has been a force on offense this season, scored

This award transcends the numbers

Hoke named Big Ten
Coach of the Year

adies and gentlemen, meet
your 2011 Big Ten Coach
of the Year: Brady Hoke.
He was an Ohio-born boy who
now perfectly depicts a Michigan
man - a coach who players love
and opponents can't help but
respect.
He looks
like Fred
Flintstone
but leads
like Mohan-
das Gandhi
(OK, maybe
that's a bit
of a stretch, KEVIN
but the man RAFTERY
knows how
to bring
people together. We'll get to that
later.)
He's a guy everybody can
relate to. He stumbles over his
words almost as often as his look-
alike stumbles on his approach at
the bowling alley.
And the numbers will tell you
he was the best coach in the Big
Ten this year.
Hoke led Michigan to a 10-2
record. In doingso, he became
just the second coach in Michi-
gan history to win 10 games in
his inaugural season. The other
was Fielding H. Yost, who went
11-0 in his first season at the helm
in 1901.
If there's anyone reading this
who was alive then, I'd love to
meet you. Back then, the forward
pass didn'teven exist. Helmets
looked more like one of those
embarrassing floppy ear hats that
the kids are wearing nowadays
than protective headgear.
Football wasn't football like
it is today. Hoke may be second
behind Yost to win 10 games in
his first year, but he's first in the
modern age of Michigan football.
On top of that, the Wolverines
finished third in the Big Ten in
total defense after finishing dead

Michigan coach BradF Hoke is the third Michigan football head coach to be named Big Ten Coach of the Year.

coach Rich Rodriguez.
The list of Michigan's impres-
sive statistics goes on. But that's
not the reason Hoke deserved
this award.
Brady Hoke is a coach in every
sense of the word. He's a leader. A
role model. A teacher. A friend.
Senior center David Molk said
it best:
"He is every single thing that
you want a college coach to be,
and he does it flawlessly."
With a group of 115 football
players, it'd be easy to leave a few
behind and focus on the ones
who will help you win games on
Saturdays. Not for Hoke.
"We have some seniors that
didn't play a snap, but they've
played plenty of snaps on the
look team and the scout team,"
Hoke said after Michigan's 30-24
victory over Ohio State last Sat-
urday. "They've been tough, and
they get in the weight room at
5:15 three days a week and go to
class. One of them's goingto law
school.

"I'm proud of all of them. It
doesn't matter who caught a
touchdown. This is a team."
And this is a team that loves its
coach. If I had a dollar for every
time one of the players said they
loved Hoke this season, I'd be a
much richer man - even if that's
not saying much.
Players say they love Hoke so
often, I often forget I'm covering
a football team.
"He is us, we are him," Molk
said after the Ohio State game. "I
love him."
Wait a minute. Was this a post-
game press conference or a Mor-
mon wedding reception? David,
please explain.
"I love how he coaches, I love
his leadership ability and how he
does it," Molk continued. "I'd do
anything for him.
"If I ever (come) back, 20 years
from now, the first guy I would
call is Coach Hoke. That's who
he is."
OK, now it makes more sense.
Thati o eserious lovne- roTt's

a love shared by everyone in that
Michigan locker room, and it's
the main reason the Wolverines
have been so successful this
season.
It's not easyto inherit a situ-
ation like Hoke did - the whole
world was watching, just waiting
to see him fail.
But Hoke never thought of it
that way.
"Look, I've got the best job in
the world," he said. "Because at
2:30 every day, I get 115 guys that
I get a chance to make a differ-
ence in their lives. What could be
funner?"
Pause. Look around.
"Or more fun. It's 'funner,'
right?"
Sure, Coach.
As if the Coach of the Year
award wasn't evidence enough,
it's safe to say Brady Hoke is right
where he belongs. And Michigan
would have it no other way.

STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily SportsEditor
After leading the Michigan
football team to a 10-2 season,
Michigan coach Brady Hoke was
named the Hayes-Schembechler
Coach of the Year and and the
Dave McClain Coach of the Year
on Wednesday.
"It's a great honor, it's hum-
bling and all those things," Hoke
said in a video released by the
Athletic Department. "But there
are so many people involved with
awards, whether it's the Heis-
man Trophy or the balloon toss,
it's one of those things that (goes
to) ... everyone who assists us in
the football program. That's an
award for everybody."
Hoke inherited a 7-5 team
from former coach Rich Rodri-
guez in January and, with the
help of offensive coordinator Al
Borges and defensive coordina-
tor Greg Mattison, transformed
the Wolverines into a confer-
ence contender. This season's
Michigan team collected its
first-ever 8-0 record at Michi-
gan Stadium.
"He deserves (Big Ten Coach
of the Year)," said senior captain
David Molk of Hoke on Monday.
"I love him. He's a great coach.
He's a great mentor. He's a great
friend. He's every single thing
you want a college coach to be
and he does it flawlessly."
Hoke was the first Michigan
coach since Fielding H. Yost in
1901 to win 10 games in his first
season. Hoke was also just the
fifth Big Ten coach to win 10
games or more in his first sea-
son as coach, joining Wiscon-
sin's Bret Bielema (12-1, 2006),
Ohio State's Earle Bruce (11-1,
1979), Yost (11-0, 1901) and Min-
nesota's Henry Williams (10-0-
2, 1900).
"Anytime you get to be around

115 guys and any time you get to
represent the winningest pro-
gram in the history of college
football and the global degree
that it is, it's always fun."
Hoke is no stranger to Coach
of the Year honors, as this is his
third selection in four seasons.
He was named Mountain West
Coach of the Year at -San Diego
State last season and Mid-Amer-
ican Conference Coach of the
Year at Ball State in 2008.
Hoke is just the sixth first-
year coach to win the McClain *
Coach of the Year award, which
dates back to 1972.
This is the inaugural award-
ing of the Hayes-Schembechler
Coach of the Year, named after
Ohio State's Woody Hayes and
Michigan's legendary coach Bo
Schembechler.
The only thing Hoke missed in
his first season at the helm was
a Big Ten title - that award will
be given to the winner of Michi-
gan State and Wisconsin in the
Big Ten Championship Game in
Indianapolis on Saturday.
Under Hoke, Michigan went
6-2 in Big Ten play.
It took former coach Rich
Rodriguez three full seasons to
collect that many conference 6
wins, and this season the Wol-
verines are poised for a potential
BCS-bowl bid.
Does a 10-2 season, a bowl
game and this award make this
season a complete success?
"Well, no, because we didn't
win the (Big Ten) champion-
ship," Hoke said. "I think we
made some growth. I think those
guys playing their last football
representing Michigan, I think
they did a tremendous job.
"But the expectation here is to
win Big Ten championships, and
we didn't do it. So, we've gotta
get ready after this bowl game
and win it next year."

LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
No player on the Michigan
hockey team wants to be invis-
ible for an extended period of the
season, least of all a captain.
But until last weekend, senior
forward David Wohlberg was
in danger of going more than
a month without putting any
points on the board. This was
unsettling for Michigan coach
Red Berenson.
"Wohlberg should be a marked
man," Berenson said. "But right
now, no one knows he's on our
team."
It's certainly a turnaround for
someone who has already prov-
en himself as a capable scorer
- Wohlberg currently leads the
team with 89 career points. And
it's a disappointment for a player
that suffered a season-ending
collarbone injury last March and
was sidelined during Michigan's
run to the national champion-
ship game.
Even earlier this season,
Wohlberg was making noise. He
posted the team's season-high
number of points in a game, and
his position as an alternate cap-
tain made him a valued com-
mander of the forward corps.
But then came Oct. 27. As
Michigan celebrated a 5-2 vic-
tory over Ferris State, no one
would have suspected it would
be the beginning of a month-long
point drought for Wohlberg.
Now No. 19 Michigan (3-5-2

confluence of print and digital mediums

ON STAGE
The University's fa-
vorite innuendo-laden
a cappella group is
back: The G-Men's fall
concert, titled "That's
What G Said," will hit
Rackham Auditorium
tomorrow night. Expect
lots of stirring male
pipes, energetic moves
and several rousing
encores. That's what
well, you get the idea:
The show starts at 8
p.m. Student tickets are

CONCERT
Chris Cornell, lead
singer of Soundgarden
and Audioslave, has
ditched the amplified
instruments after re-
leasing an acoustic solo
album. Showcasing his
raw yet talented voice,
the grunge pioneer has
gone ontour, playing
re-imagined covers of
songs from his entire
career. He'll be per-
forming at the Michi-
gan Theater on Sunday
at 4 p.m. - tickets are
sold out, so try begging
his groupies.

Tucked away in a corner of
the Shapiro Undergraduate
Library, a bulky and unassum-
ing machine whirrs to life. A
few clicks of a mouse send the
mini assembly line housed within into a fren-
zy while its Plexiglas exoskeleton provides
observers a front-row seat to watch the care-
fully calibrated action.
Seven minutes later, the machine spits out
an entire paperback book.
This isn't astack ofstapled computer pages.
It's a retail-quality product glued
and bound with a semi-gloss full-
color cover that looks like it was
just pulled from a nearby shelf. Still
warmto the touch, the newly mint-
ed School of Social Work textbook
waits to be joined by nine identical
copies, which will soon find their
way into the hands of University
students, all for about $6 a pop.
While book lovers and e-reader
fanatics everywhere enjoy pitting
the established worldofprint media
against the up-and-coming innova-
tions of the digital age, student and
faculty publishers at the University
of Michigan have long been able to
see the inherent fallacy within this
hyped-up conflict.
As a seamless marriage of elec-
tronic convenience and physical
utility, Shapiro's Espresso Book
Machine is a perfect symbol of
the University's ultimate vision:
No matter the format, publishing
should allow scholarly information
to become a volume greater than
the sum of its parts.
PRINT AND BEYOND
The Espresso Book Machine is
operated by MPublishing, which
acts as the Universitys primary
academic publishing umbrella: It encom-
passes the University of Michigan Press, the
Scholarly Publishing Office, Deep Blue (a fac-
ulty repository), the Copyright Office and the
Text Creation Partnership.
The mostrecognizable entity of MPublish-
ing is the University Press, which has more
than 80 years of quality publishing experi-
ence under itsabelt.
Surprisingly, the majority of the work
printed by university presses is for non-local
faculty. Presses tend to focus on developing
texts from only a few specific literary fields,
drawing in authors who study within those
academic disciplines from across the country.
The University Press has historically special-
This is the besi
time ever to be
reader.
-Shana Kimball, MPublis
Head of Publishing Services, Outr
and Strategic Developi

ized in areas such as political science, disabil-
ity studies and ESL.
Though this field-specific focus is a tra-
ditional aspect of all university presses, the
technological development of MPublishing's
services means specialization isngiving wayto
a broad and inclusive publishing environment
for a wide range of scholars.
"About five percent of our author pool is U
of M faculty," said Karen Hill, interim direc-
tor and digital manager of the University
Press. "But we're not excluding them. One of

good representation of your illustrations."
While many faculty members continue
to request print copies of their work, there
is an undeniable sense that the world of
information on paper is slowly finding a new
niche within the publishing structure of the
future. Even Siebers, most of whose works
have been published in print, pointed out
that research and sharing have become a
digital process.
"The curious thing about this process is
that most of the reading that I do, I actually
do online," Siebers said. "I'd say
90 percent - certainly, the vast
majority of what I do, I do online
now, and the only exception
to that is material that doesn't
appear in e-books"
As an author and a reader,
Siebers has recognized a more
holistic trend in the information
industry. Instead of straddling
an extreme divide between the
use of print and digital technol-
ogy, the academic community is
shifting toward a thriving "mul-
timedia" environment.
"It's wrong to think that read-
ing is only reading on a page,"
Siebers said. "When you look
at magazines there's always
illustrations, and having music
and video links on a page just
enhances the experience of read-
ing."
BREAKING NEW GROUND
One of the major milestones
for the University's publish-
ing division was the decision to
unite the University Press and
other smaller publishing units
with the University's MLibrary
under MPublishing in 2009. The
library had traditionally been a
pioneer of digital archiving and dissemina-
tion, as the University was the original home
for the widely read JSTOR journal database,
and their technological experience has had
an undeniable impact on MPublishing's
approach to their goals.
"The University library had been a leader
in the building of digital infrastructure for
libraries," said Shana Kimball, head of pub-
lishing services, outreach and strategic devel-
opment for MPublishing. "So it seemed like if
we were digitizing our own collections and
building these tools and expertise, we could
also think about that for the use of a spectrum
of new scholarly publications."
See PUBLISHING, Page 3B

our goals is to build that author pool and see if
we can't grow that number."
English Prof. Tobin Siebers has pub-
lished multiple textbooks with the Uni-
versity Press, many of which address
disability studies. While his books have
mainly appeared solely in print form,
Siebers found that some forms of digital
publishing, specifically electronic journals,
complement his work well.
"This had to do specifically with illustra-
tions," Siebers said. "Because the cost of color
illustrations is so large, it's almost impossible
to get good print quality. When you publish
in online journals, they can publish the color
illustrations very easily, and so you get a really

which restaurant makes it best.
HOT CHOCOLATE

ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY
521 East Liberty Street
Like Willy Wonka's factory, the Rocky
Mountain Chocolate Factory has a river
of warm, rich, melted chocolate that it
serves to customers for less than three
bucks a cup. RMCF's hot chocolate is like
drinking a liquid version of the delectable
chocolates sold in the store. Pair with
a fudge-covered apple for an Augustus
Gloop-inspired chocolate overload.
COMET COFFEE
16 Nickels Arcade
Tucked away among the specialty shops
of Nickels Arcade, Comet Coffee excels
in paying attention to the little details.
Though a bit pricy, a cup of hot chocolate is
served at a lukewarm temperature with an
elegant froth design. The flavor might be a
bitunderwhelming,butthe taste of quality
milk makes up for it.

STARBUCKS
1214 South University Avenue
Starbucks has been at this whole coffee
business for a while - so this joint knows
how to bring it. There's nothing smoother
than the rich sensation of Starbucks hot
chocolate, warm and inviting, lavishly
topped with a dollop of whipped cream and
a sweet drizzling of silky chocolate sauce.
Wrap cold fingers around the toasty, limit-
ed-edition holidaycup and enjoy.
BRUEGGER'S BAGELS
709 North University Avenue
Bruegger's plays its hot chocolate
straight - there's no foam, no whipped
cream, no sprinkles, no nothing. But
that's because the bagel establishment
can afford to leave the wintery treat
unadorned. The hot chocolate stands on
its own, with a pure, strong chocolately
flavor.

D 'MY SO-CALLED LIFE' (1994-1995), ABC
Claire Danes brought '90s teens to 'Life' onscreen

By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Daily Arts Writer
Many people consider the
'60s and '70s the rule-breaking
decades, a time for protest and
radicalism. But what about the
'90s? That decade, too, was a time
for shaking things up. The '90s
was a time for breaking rules and
breaking ground, especially on
television. ABC's teen drama "My
So-Called Life" is no exception.
Despite its early cancellation,
the show sparked a movement of
serious, candid teen dramas and
remains the most evocative and
sincere depiction of high-school
life ever captured on television.

"My So-Called Life" revolves
around Angela Chase (Claire
Danes, "Homeland"), a naive
yet strong sophomore whose
voiceovers fill every episode. The
show uses this technique more
effectively than most shows ever
manage. Her commentary is poi-
gnant and perceptive at times,
though always delivered in the
believable voice of a high school-
er, with plenty of filler words
and pauses. Angela remarks in
the pilot, "Like cheerleaders.
Can't people just cheer on their
own, like, to themselves?" Other
times, her narration is dramatic:
"So I started hanging out with
Rayanne Graff. Just for fun. Just

'cause it seemed like if I didn't, I of her. Angela at school, Angela
would die, or something." at home, Angela trying to fit in,
Angela trying to stand out. And
there are more than just Angela's

ters borrow the diary and share
their own emotions.

Armstrong, "One Tree Hill") and
other parents also get to share

pages of her diary. And that's own. Other '90s shows such as
what this show really is - Angela "Dawson's Creek" and "Beverly
Chase's diary, a place where we Hills 90210" also gave screen
see not just her, but all variations time to parents. Making the par-

ents real characters adds an extra
dimension to a show, but we rare-
ly see this anymore - the "Glee"
parents are nondescript and most
of the "Vampire Diaries" guard-
ians are dead or nameless.
"My So-Called Life" also por-
trayed realistic and compelling
friendships, seen best in Angela's
and Rayanne's (A. J. Langer, "Pri-
vate Practice") relationship. Ray-
anne, the show's best character,
is a stark contrast to suburban,
principled Angela. Rayanne was
raised by a single mother, and
she drinks, celebrates in the girl's
bathroom when voted "Most Slut
Potential" and always dances
on the edge. Angela's attraction

to Rayanne perfectly captures
best friendship between teenage
girls. Angela is devoted to Ray-
anne and listens to her. Rayanne
loves Angela right back, saying
early on in their friendship: "I'll
always watch out for you, OK? I'll
always be there for you, so don't
worry." Their connection is inti-
mate, which is a representation of
young female friendship true to
life, but hard to find on television.
One typical'90s trope that "My
So-Called Life" managed to avoid
was the idea of the "very special
episode." Networks in the '90s
popularized the term, which was

fall under the Creative Commons
license, but it also allows students,
staff and members of the Ann
Arbor community to publish their

From Page 1B
MPublishing's self-professed
commitment to all forms of schol-
arly information is crystal clear.
Though it provides first-rate stan-
dard print and digital book ser-
vices, the division's nonstandard
approaches to new modes of shar-
ing information truly set it apart.
"There are more ways to pub-
lish than just in a basic journal
article and book form," Kimball
said. "We're really interested in
broadening access to the scholarly
record in as many ways as pos-
sible."
One of the University Press's
newest and most anticipated
initiatives is the use of an XML
workflow to publish academic
material. XML, also known as
Extensible Markup Language,
allows an entire book to be
reduced to a single packet of com-
puter coding, creating a "mas-
ter file" that can be sent to paper
printers, e-book publishers and
web archives.
By beginning with an XML
book file, the publishing process
can be streamlined for digital and
print publishers while offering
readers various choices on how
to get the information. Not only
can the system accommodate dif-
ferent modes of output, but it can
also allow publishers to use new
methods for releasing scholarly
information that's in "publishing
transit."
"(The transition to XML) will
allow us to parse and piece out
things earlier in the process," Hill
said. "If we want to use pieces for
marketing purposes or put a first
chapter up early, we're changing
our workflow so it can flow into
whatever system it needs to pres-

n the Shapiro Undergraduate Library and is available for anyone to use. It takes about seven rinutes to print a paperback book.

ent that."
The University of Michigan
is one of the few universities
experimenting with XML-based
publishing, and its innovative uti-
lization of the coding process has
garnered a lot of attention, which
is hardly a surprise for a publish-
ing division accustomed to turn-
ing academic heads.
"People are watching how we
support these new pathways with
new skills and new workflows,"
Hill said. "That's one of the things
that does set us apart a little bit
from others when they look at
what we're doing and how we're
doing it."
XML formatting is just one
of MPublishing's many ground-
breaking initiatives, each of which
aims to transform reading into a
more immersive and enriching
experience.
The University Press recently
collaborated with the University's
theater department to create a
web community centered around
"Theater Historiography," a text-
book printed by the University
Press. The highly integrated site
features videos, reviews, a faculty
and student forum and discus-
sions among scholars about the
author's ideas.
MPublishing is also exploring
options geared toward a reassess-
ment of textbooks, making the
project an exciting prospect for
students and their wallets.
"We're really looking at the
whole range of textbook options,
both from a digital and printper-
spective but also from a pricing
perspective," Hill said. "We're
tryingto figure out how we can get
this information into the hands of
students in a more effective way."
The opportunity to tackle so
many new projects is a rare gift
for a university publisher, as press

budgets are routinely slashed dur-
ing tough economic times. The
combination of ingenuity and the
distinctive partnership between
the University's publishing sec-
tors and its libraries is the press's
greatest strength.
"The library has the culture
of experimentation and a will-
ingness to take risks," Hill said.
"There's a conservativeness at
university presses, but when
they partner up with someone
like a library, it opens the door
for much more in the way of
being comfortable in exploring
new ways of working."
"I think that has got the atten-
tion of a lot of other university
presses too, because they just
don't have that same resource,"
Hill added.
Ultimately though, experi-
mentation and innovation are
focused on finding the most
effective ways for the library to
cater to the desires of academic
writers and readers who use the
press to spread and consume
information.
"I would say that we design our
publishing services to really try to
meet the needs of our scholars,"
Kimball said. "We don't have a
particular agenda about going in
(a print or digital) direction. It's
always a negotiation between
what can we afford as a publisher
and what our authors and readers
want."
Looking outside MPublishing
MPublishing may represent a
hefty percentage of the Univer-
sity's press capabilities, but it's
not alone. Countless independent
units exist on campus: Every-
thing from faculty research to stu-
dent poetry is printed, uploaded
and shared every day across and

beyond the University's academic
community. One example is the
Fortnight Literary Press.
Fortnight, which is partially
funded by the Undergraduate
English Association, is a liter-
ary magazine that prints student
prose, poetry and art. Its issues
are released on a monthly basis
and its tight budget shapes much
of the careful planning that goes
into each installment.
"Each semester, we get a cer-
tain amount of money from the
English Department," said LSA
senior Rachel Fentin, Fortnight's
co-editor in chief. "So we really do
have to think about our monetary
restrictions in terms of how many
issues canwe print, orifwe canwe
print in color. But the nice thing
about Fortnight is that it's really
flexible."
Though Fortnight and UAE are
independent of one another, the
magazine has greatly benefited
from a decision to move its issues
into an online format to accom-
pany the distribution of its print
magazines, mirroring MPublish-
ing's multimedia initiative.
The magazine's crisp online
reading interface, which allows
readers to enjoy full-color layouts
and functionally animated page
turns, serves as much more than
just an archive for past material.
The web distribution gives it a
digital anchor point while helping
the magazine to reach a wider stu-
dent audience, including prospec-
tive writers.
"We thought it would be really
important to have a way for people
to look at what we do since we
don't really have a central loca-
tion," Fentin said. "It's really nice
to be able to point people that are
interested in becoming involved
with Fortnight to our website so
that they can check out past work

there."

"magical" experience.
"Wouldn't you feel that (magic)
when it's a cold winter's night and
the entire downtown is all lit up

Whether students are heading

specific episodes and garner big
ratings. "Very special episodes"
usually dealt with controver-
sial issues like adultery, sexual
assault, eating disorders or drunk
driving. But the problems that
arose from these social issues
were usually resolved neatly at
episode's end. No single episode
of "My So-Called Life" was a
"very special episode" because
all of them were "very special."
Classmate Rickie's (Wilson
Cruz, "Party of Five") sexuality
and Rayanne's drug abuse were
continual themes, and the show

dealt with less-covered issues,
like pretty-boy Jordan Catalano's
(Jared Leto, "Fight Club") dys-
lexia.
Obviously, there could never
be a show today exactly like
"My So-Called Life." So many
things about it are inherently
'90s-esque - the two-sizes-
too-big clothing, lip liner, refer-
ences to Hillary Clinton's new
haircut. But are there any shows
these days about high school-
ers just being high schoolers?
"Gossip Girl" is fabricated, the
characters of "90210" barely
attend school and the "Pretty
Little Liars" are so beautiful
and privileged they could never
be as accessible as Angela and

Rayanne. MTV's "Awkward" is
the closest match, but despite its
strong characters, it still doesn't
ring with the candor of "My So-
Called Life."
In just 19 episodes, "My So-
Called Life" made me fall in love
with its characters to the point
where I'm still holding a grudge
against ABC for its premature
cancellation. Its early demise is a
shame not only because we don't
get to see these characters con-
tinue to grow, but also because
it's a reminder of the television
no longer around - a simple
coming-of-age story devoid of
supernatural elements, self-
indulgence or picture-perfect
hairstyles.
