Art professor confronts 
spousal discrimination

Grievance board 
investigating claims 
found promotion 
process was biased

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Summer Daily News Editor

A University of Michigan faculty 

member in the School of Art & 
Design said she was the subject 
of discrimination based on her 
gender and status as a spousal 
hire throughout the process of 
consideration for promoting her 
from associate to full professor 
in 2016. A University grievance 
board investigating Associate Prof. 
Rebekah Modrak’s claims has 
concluded the promotion process 
was unfair, and it identified a 
“climate of bias toward members 
of the Dual Career Program” in the 
Art & Design School.

Though Modrak, the spouse of 

Art & Design Prof. Nick Tobier, 
is not currently pressing charges, 
Sarah Prescott, her attorney, says 
it’s an option they will pursue 
should the University fail to address 

their claims.

“We have a lot of affection for 

the University, and we want it to 
do the right thing without having 
to be forced,” Prescott said. “So 
that’s something that’s definitely an 
option to go forward. It’s something 
that we’ve really stepped back from, 
and we’re trying to exhaust any 
other opportunities or avenues first. 
The answer is not yet.”

Modrak would likely bring the 

suit under the Michigan Elliot-
Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976, 
which 
prohibits 
discrimination 

based on “religion, race, color, 
national origin, age, sex, height, 
weight, familial status, or marital 
status,” 
in 
employment 
and 

education, among other areas.

Modrak was hired through the 

University’s Dual Career Program, 
which is managed by the Office 
of the Provost. The program is 
mainly used as a recruiting tool for 
faculty, providing spouses of faculty 
members an inside track for the 
hiring process themselves.

“Having long recognized dual 

career partner assistance as a 
crucial element in recruiting and 
retaining 
its 
excellent 
faculty, 

the University of Michigan has 
developed one of the strongest dual 
career programs in the country,” 
the Office of the Provost’s website 
reads.

However, some don’t share 

the Office’s opinion. According 
to a statement from Modrak 
corroborated by a signed affidavit 
from a colleague, Art & Design Prof. 
Holly Hughes, at a 2012 meeting 
regarding the dual-career hiring 
of a woman to associate professor, 
said 
the 
woman 
“should 
be 

embarrassed” to be a spousal hire.

When Hughes was later placed 

on 
the 
committee 
reviewing 

Modrak’s case for promotion by Art 
& Design Dean Gunalan Nadarajan, 
Modrak 
raised 
concerns 
with 

Nadarajan about Hughes’s ability to 
remain unbiased in reviewing her 
case. Nadarajan, whose wife, Irina 
Aristarkhova, was the associate 
professor Hughes said should be 
embarrassed to be a spousal hire, 
did not find merit with Modrak’s 
concerns, and Hughes remained on 
the committee.

Modrak’s case closely mirrors 

the case of Profs. Scott Kurashige

Deer cull survives 
City’s half-hearted 
attempt to defund

Council considered 
eliminating program 
to fund pedestrian 
safety and climate 
action intiatives

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Summer Daily News Editor

City Council voted 8-3 Monday 

night against an amendment to 
the Ann Arbor’s proposed budget 
for the 2018 fiscal year that 
would have defunded the city’s 
controversial deer management 
program in order to fund climate 
and pedestrian safety initiatives.

The program, initiated in 

2015, 
aimed 
to 
reduce 
the 

deer population in Ann Arbor 
using lethal means, such as 
sharpshooting, as well as non-
lethal means, such as female 
sterilization. Its intent is to 
prevent overbrowsing of local 
vegetation and reduce deer-

vehicle collisions.

The cull has been the point of 

contentious debate between city 
government and residents. Some 
have criticized the cull for its 
violent and accused the council 
of being less than transparent in 
their public dealings regarding 
it. Although the city recently 
commissioneda 
study 
from 

Michigan 
State 
University 

on 
local 
attitudes 
regarding 

the cull, with the eventual 
goal of achieving 75 percent 

satisfaction across the city, the 
city also conducted a survey in 

2016 in which 54 percent of the 
more than 2,000 respondents 
indicated 
they 
approved 
of 

lethal methods of population 
management 
and 
61 
percent 

approved of non-lethal methods.

Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor, 

a sponsor of the amendment, 
offered little criticism of the 

cull, but said the resources that 
went toward it would be better 
spent elsewhere.

“I think that we have come 

forward with a deer management 
program that, if we’re gonna have 
one, in its entirety, is good,” he 
said. “I think what we’re doing 
is professional and is thoughtful. 
For my part, I just don’t think 
we should be doing it, I think we 
have better things to do with that 
money.”

Councilmembers 
Jason 

Frenzel (D–Ward 1) and Chip 
Smith (D–Ward 5), sponsors of 
the amendment and the other 
two yes votes on the amendment, 
said they thought it was the best 
option for a budget cut in order to 
fund climate action programs. 

However, Ann Arbor resident 

David 
Silkworth, 
who 
is 

currently 
contesting 
Smith’s 

Ward 5 seat, spoke out against 
the amendment during the public 
comment portion of the meeting, 
accusing its sponsors of using 
the amendment to gain goodwill 
rather than truly supporting it.

“I’m a longtime opponent of 

using lethal deer management 
methods 
within 
our 
city, 

and I’m a strong supporter of 
pedestrian safety infrastructure 
improvements,” Silkworth said. 
“So you’re probably wondering why 
I currently oppose Amendment 5. I 
oppose it because I see it as nothing 
more than a disingenuous and 
irresponsible political maneuver 
intended to endear its sponsors 
to both anti-cull activists, ardent 
cyclists, and anyone concerned 
about pedestrian safety issues.”

Councilmember 
Julie 
Grand 

(D–Ward 3), who voted against the 
amendment, said if it passed, the 
past two years of funding the cull 
would have been a waste, and with 
continued investment the program 
would eventually require less and less 
funding.

“I feel that it’s just fiscally 

irresponsible to throw the funding 
that we put in the last two years 
toward deer management –– it would 
just be throwing it away,” she said. 
“I want us to get to the point where 
we’re not spending a quarter of a 
million dollars every year, and the 
way that we do that is to just deal 
with the fact that we need to spend 
this money now, and invest it, and 
hopefully go forward to the point 
where we can sustain management 
practices for a lot less money.”

Citing the ecological damage 

deer do to the city’s wildlife via 
overbrowsing, Councilmember Sumi 
Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) said she 
agreed that climate action was a 
worthy goal, but by voting against the 
amendment she felt she was voting 
in favor of the environment.

I think what 
we’re doing is 

professional and 

is thoughtful.

Author H. Luke Shaefer presents 
his research on challenges faced 
by the impoverished community

Lecture hosted by 
Institute of Social 
Research meant to 
impart experience 
of living in poverty

By CHETALI JAIN

Daily Staff Reporter

H. Luke Shaefer, director of 

Poverty Solutions at the Univer-
sity of Michigan and co-author of 
acclaimed book “$2.00 a Day: Liv-
ing on Almost Nothing in Ameri-
ca,” spoke to University students 
and faculty Tuesday afternoon 
about the stratification of the poor 
in the United States and the chal-
lenges faced by the extremely 
impoverished.

The event, hosted by the Popu-

lation Studies Center at the Uni-
versity of Michigan’s Institute 
for Social Research, was meant to 
teach attendees about ISR and the 
repercussions of living below the 
poverty line. 

According to Shaefer, since 1996, 

there has been a steady rise in the 

number of households with chil-
dren living in extreme poverty. 
Furthermore, while the 2000s saw 
an increase in the number of chil-
dren on public health care, those at 
the very bottom of the income lad-
der were still slipping through the 
cracks.

Rackham student Lanora John-

son, who is pursuing a doctorate 
in sociology, said she attended the 
talk to learn about the research 
being done on low-income house-
holds. She also said she feels it is 
important to convey the complex 
topic of poverty in terms of data 
and facts to reach a wider audience.

“It’s also good to hear…that it is 

something that is cared about in a 
place that seems in a lot of visual 
ways very removed from (this) 
kind of background,” Johnson said.

To gather information and fur-

ther context for his work, Shaefer 
ventured into low-income neigh-
borhoods to see firsthand how poor 
socioeconomic status affects the 
people living there. He described 
how this level of work led him to 
experiences that data often does 
not show.

“You encounter things that 

aren’t really visible,” he said. 

“There’s a lot that data misses…and 
it explains what the families are 
going through.”

He told a story of one such fam-

ily from Birmingham, Alabama 
who endured hardships and legal 
red tape in their search for a suit-
able home to settle down. The 
mother was forced to uproot her 
family when her sons were put in 
danger due to the violence in their 
neighborhood.

Through a whirlwind of unfor-

tunate events including being 
turned away multiple times from 
a shelter in Tennessee where she 
was promised a room, her chil-
dren were taken into the welfare 
system against her wishes. She is 
now fighting to get them back.

Shaefer explained the mother 

got a job and worked 30 to 35 
hours a week, only to receive 
a paycheck hundreds of dol-
lars less than she expected. The 
Tennessee 
state 
government 

had taken some of it to pay for 
the child support and had also 
charged her a 12 percent interest 
rate.

AARON BAKER/Daily

Social Work professor H. Luke Shaefer presents on living in poverty in America 
at the Institue of Social Research on Tuesday. 

and Emily Lawsin, in which they 
claim the University retaliated 
against their attempts to report 
discrimination 
based 
on 
their 

marriage and race.

Though Nadarajan encouraged 

her to apply for promotion and 
promised to support her promotion, 
according to Modrak, he did not 
keep his promise, and in fact 
identified one of the external 
reviewers 
as 
unsupportive 
of 

Modrak’s promotion, despite the 
reviewer’s insistence otherwise. 
Furthermore, 
the 
promotion 

committee removed Modrak’s book 
“Reframing Photography: Theory 
and Practice” from consideration 
in her promotion based on the fact 
that they had already considered 
it during her tenure promotion 
in 2007 –– even though the book 
wasn’t completed until 2010.

The aforementioned external 

reviewer 
Steven 
McCarthy, 
a 

professor of graphic design at the 
University of Minnesota, wrote 
in a signed affidavit he found the 
removal highly unusual.

“I was surprised to later learn 

that Prof. Modrak’s important 
contribution, her book Reframing 
Photography: Theory and Practice, 
was not considered in favor of 
promotion at the University of 
Michigan,” he wrote. “Excluding, 
discounting 
or 
otherwise 
not 

evaluating 
a 
practitioner’s 

complete body of work in this, the 
ultimate decision toward career 
advancement, is to my knowledge 
unheard of in our field of work.”

In the affidavit, McCarthy also 

confirmed his unequivocal support 
for Modrak’s promotion.

“I concluded that her work did 

clearly qualify for promotion, and 

my letter said so,” he wrote. “My 
letter as to Prof. Modrak was not 
written in code or as mere courtesy; 
it was my true opinion based 
on my twenty-eight years as an 
academic, the national standards 
in the disciplines of art and design, 
and norms within R1 research 
universities.”

Modrak 
said 
McCarthy’s 

experience 
was 
not 
unique, 

claiming Nadarajan ignored the 
advice of every reviewer. Nadarajan 
did not respond to multiple requests 
for comment.

In addition to a grievance 

committee, Modrak opened a case 
with the University’s Office for 
Institutional Equity on the denial of 
her promotion, in which she said she 
was obstructed.

“The OIE investigator refused to 

question my witnesses in writing, 
explaining that she had already 
determined, before speaking with 
them, that they would have no 
relevant information,” she said.

In addition to concluding Hughes 

brought bias into the promotion 
process, the grievance board found 
that the OIE investigation was 
flawed, and that their arguments 
against 
Modrak’s 
case 
were 

“tenuous and lacked true merit.”

Modrak is now seeking recourse 

and sanctions for Hughes through 
the Office of the Provost. Bringing 
her case to Robert Sellers, Vice 
Provost for Equity and Inclusion and 
Chief Diversity Officer, Modrak said 
Sellers seemed “concerned but said 
that he could make no promises.”

Modrak’s dossier for promotion is 

to be reviewed this summer by a new 
Art & Design School committee, still 
headed by Nadarajan.

When 
asked 
for 
comment, 

University 
spokewoman 
Kim 

Broekhuizen declined, saying the 
University “does not comment on 
personnel matters.”

legislative session,” she said. “One 
of the things that surprised most 
people who read about it was a focus 
in Washington state by Microsoft 
on race and justice reform.”

Talks on Detroit
Business 
Prof. 
Jerry 
Davis 

facilitated another session titled 
“The Revitalization of Detroit: A 
Story of Commitment, Creativity 
and Partnership,” which brought 
together four panelists whose work 
shapes rebuilding efforts in the city.

In his opening remarks, Jerry 

Norcia, the Chief Operating Officer 
of DTE Energy, discussed the role 
of DTE in reshaping Detroit.

“When we talk about serving 

with our energy, we’re first talking 
about serving with the energy of 
our employees,” he said. “It has a 
double meaning for us. Without our 
employees, we’re not able to serve. 
When you think of our traditional 
products — we serve with natural 

gas, we serve with electricity, which 
really continues to be the foundation 
of progress in the communities we 
live and serve.”

In a different vein, Susan Mosey, 

Executive Director of Midtown 
Detroit, Inc., a nonprofit planning 
and development agency, noted 
collaboration among several large 
actors in the city. She said years ago 
Detroit didn’t have a stable system 
of community development finance 
institutions — large national players 
of capital that use foundation 
dollars and other forms of funding 
to provide affordable lending to 
disadvantaged communities.

Several 
large 
foundations 

including the Kresge Foundation 
and 
Ford 
Foundation 
helped 

the city engage with a large 
national 
development 
finance 

institution called Capital Impact 
Partners. Several other national 
institutions got involved with the 
city as well under the direction of 
such foundations to spend their 
investment and grant dollars in 
Detroit.

Mosey 
explained 
Detroit 

suddenly had a lot of money for 
real estate and small business 
development. She said without such 
programs and collaboration, there 
wouldn’t be a “viable” Detroit.

Whole Foods Market
On 
Friday 
afternoon, 
the 

series of speakers concluded with 
thoughts on how to augment 
positive 
business 
practices 
by 

Walter Robb, part of the Board of 
Directors of Whole Foods Market. 
He noted in many communities, 
such as Detroit, people are hesitant 
of corporations coming in and 
attempting to change the culture 
there.

“A lot of people in downtown 

Detroit have had the experience of 
corporations coming in and ripping 
them off,” he said. “It was very 
humbling to be a large company 
realizing you have to start at square 
one with the community.”

OPINION

I

n my participation in the never-
ending 
American 
consumer 

competition 
of 
material 

acquisition, I recently purchased a 
fitness tracking smart watch that 
not only monitors my semi-decent 
heart rate, but also tracks and maps 
my outdoor workouts through GPS 
technology. I enthusiastically wear, use 
and check this watch with nearly every 
activity I’m doing. 

And as I write this very article with 

said digital monitor fixated to my right 
wrist, I continue to willingly submit 
myself to the ever present surveilling 
technology that continues to grow 
within our lives. Technology that 
destroys the concepts of privacy and 
solitude in the name of comfort and 
security. For I willingly wear a watch 
that knows where I go, is connected 
to a phone that knows what I say, and 
uploads my data to a laptop that knows 
who I am. 

A 
recent 
article 
in 
Fortune 

highlighted 
the 
consequences 

associated with the blind enthusiastic 
use of technology. The article detailed 
a speech given by Microsoft CEO 
Satya Nadella on how modern tech 
companies should understand and 
avoid the development of creations with 
serious society altering side effects. 
“Technology could be used to create 
an endless wave of distractions for the 
public, leading to people living ‘without 
meaning or purpose’. New societies in 
which glowing screens could be “used 
to control and dictate” the masses 
would become reality. 

This obligation of the immensely 

wealthy tech companies to ensure the 

input of morality into development is 
truly impossible. The advancement of 
technology by profitable businesses 
only spurs the creation of more 
products such as the smart watch or 
virtual reality headsets. We as a species 
have already entered into a world of 
almost total reliance on ever present 
and intelligent digital technology 
— which has also invaded our most 
precious forms of privacy. 

Yet no government forced such 

products upon us. No authority 
dictated the necessity of home 
security cameras linked to our 
iPhones, or smart watches which 
track our every move. We have done 
so willingly. We ourselves are guilty 
for allowing the invasions from 
surveillance, not through force or 
coercion, but subtle enticement with 
the seemingly endless gratifications 
offered 
from 
an 
ever 
present 

technology. 

Smart phones can predict our 

decisions, watches track our heart 
rates and fitness patterns, multiple 
computers, laptops, and tablets flatter 
us by knowing our shopping habits, 
TV shows and favorite websites — all 
of it willingly embraced by us who 
knowingly expose ourselves to such 
invasive surveillance. 

Professor 
Bernard 
Harcourt 

detailed this submission in his book 
Exposed, “In our digital 

frenzy to share snapshots and 

updates, to text and video chat with 
friends and lovers, to ‘quantify’ 
ourselves, 
we 
are 
exposing 

ourselves—rendering 
ourselves 

virtually 
transparent 
to 
anyone 

with 
rudimentary 
technological 

capabilities” 

And 
these 
advantages 
are 
all 

completely superficial, temporary, and 

more importantly, the sheer magnitude 

of the costs of such actions are not 

readily understood. For we now live 

in “a new virtual transparence that is 

dramatically 
reconfiguring 
relations 

of power throughout society, that is 

redrawing our social landscape and 

political possibilities, that is producing 

a dramatically new circulation of 

power in society”. Our willing exposure 

has created this circulation of power, 

a circulation that places capitalist 

telecommunications 
companies 
and 

powerful governments at the top, while 

further enticing the American people 

into believing fitness trackers are worth 

the total surveillance. 

And what exactly are the costs 

to our privacy? What is the point of 
ensuring the protection such rights? 

The values of solitude and privacy 

allow for individuals to be able to 
escape the observation of others to 
both understand the most personal and 
private of emotions and to experiment 
with and ponder new ideas. There is a 
paramount importance to protecting 
these abilities for they allow for new 
forms of human expression to able to 
be created free and untainted from the 
influence of capitalist marketing and 
the oppressive security apparatuses of 
intrusive governments. 

And the power to think for one’s 

own self is central to the progression of 
society. Privacy allows for individuals 
to be able to silently challenge the 
ideas of rulers, kings and masters. The

The dangers of technology

comfortable and secure solitude that 
forces the mind to ponder the status 
quo allows of the growth of progressive 
ideas. Freedom, liberty, democracy, 
destiny — all concepts developed and 
grown by human beings having the 
ability to challenge their rulers free 
from surveillance or observation. 

The modern American state now has 

the ability to undermine such freedoms 
that is sought in secure silence. The 
ever present technologies now invade 
these once private realms. It does not 
take a creative mind to imagine how 
history would have been altered if 
oppressive leaders in the past had the 
surveilling capabilities of the present. 
The Civil Rights movement, workers’ 
right and the women’s movement — all

Therefore,

require progressive challenges and 
independent thinking towards the 
status quo. Issues such as income 
inequality, racism, sexism, homophobia 
and many more all require free thought 
and experimentation that cannot 
be undermined by an oppressive 
government. 

And despite these strong opinions 

I have towards the dangers of 
technologies and the necessity of 
privacy, I never took my smart watch 
off my wrist while writing this article, I 
checked my twitter three or four times, 
and I sent this piece to my editor over 
an email sever that I am more than 
confident the NSA has taken a glimpse 
at. 

I love my new watch.

MICHAEL MORDARSKI | COLUMN

C

ollege in 2017, it seems, is 
not quite the place for a 
hopeless and somewhat 

obnoxious romantic like me. Ever 
since the ripe age of 10 years, 
I’ve clung to a certain idealism, 
assuming myself the heroine of 
the cheesiest and most dramatic 
love stories. In the words of my 
now boyfriend, I am “dramatic 
AF.”

Though 
my 
current 

relationship 
is 
hardly 
the 

fairytale 
love 
story 
of 
my 

childhood dreams, I’ve learned 
to recognize the elements that 
mark it just as romantic — 
which, to me, seemed “normal”: 
high school classmates, best 
friends 
first, 
honorary 
old 

married couple.

I thought what I had was 

standard, that everyone else 
was just as devout an idealist 
as me. In fact, hookup culture 
and online dating were cornered 
off into the back of my mind, 
acknowledged only by TV shows, 
movies and memes I saw purely 
as entertainment. It took me 
months into college to realize 
how wrong I was.

To be clear, this is not in 

reference to frat party hookups 
and dorm-room flings (though 
their prevalence came as a shock 
to me as well). My romantic 
standards were for those who 
were looking not for one-night-
stands, but for the companionship 
and connection of a relationship. 
Thus, it was seemingly out of 

nowhere that a dating app I’ve 
known of — but never registered 
as a reality — found its way into 
every crevice of my social life: 
Tinder.

It’s no secret that Tinder is the 

classic “hookup app,” but for some 
indeterminate reason, it gave me 
another 
negative 
connotation. 

I’ve always imagined the typical 
Tinder user as a desperate, lonely 
40- or 50-something who was 
past his/her sexual prime, with 
no other means of kindling a new 
flame. Hence, it seemed foreign to 
me that it was so popular among 
college kids who could, in theory, 
easily and innocently stumble 
upon a love interest simply by 
stepping outside (at such a large 
and busy university, no less!).

I watched, minorly astonished 

and majorly confused, as my 
friends swiped left on the guys 
who weren’t “cute enough,” and 
right on the ones who “were.” As 
they compared their “matches” 
established solely upon mutual 
attraction to six edited photos. As 
they flirted online, met a select 
few in person and were crushed 
when their knight in shining 
phone screen was looking for 
none other than — you guessed it 
— a hookup.

OPINION

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

B

iologist 
Edward 
Wilson 

once remarked that biology 
seemingly holds us “on a 

leash,” and though we can design 
and develop our lives, we live 
within the constraints of human 
biology. The beauty of a leash, 
however, is that we are tethered, 
not immoveable. For example, we 
still have implicit bias, but through 
introspection and exposure to 
different backgrounds, we can 
change our perspective and stretch 
our biological and moral “leash.” 
In my inquiry and approach to the 
purpose and legality of sanctuary 
cities, I find this analogy useful to 
answer the following questions: 
How much are sanctuary cities, 
counties and states acting on a 
“legal leash” with immigration law? 
When do ethics supersede the law?

I struggle with sanctuary cities 

frequently. I don’t doubt the many 
instances in which sanctuary 
cities act as safe havens for people 
fleeing persecution and bringing 
otherwise valuable workers to the 
United States work force, nor do 
I doubt we are a “nation of laws,” 
and those who undermine the law 
must be held accountable. The real 
debate with sanctuary cities is 
how long the legal leash should be 
between the federal government 
and local government.

Though we are familiar with 

places such as New York City, 
Chicago and San Francisco as 
sanctuary cities defying the federal 
government, the original debate 
was one between church and 
state. The initial movement began 
with a refugee crisis in the 1980s. 
During this time, Reverend John 
Fife of South Presbyterian Church 
in Tucson, Ariz. took in a few 
parishioners from El Salvador in 
1980 who were fleeing the war and 
persecution from the government. 
Though he questioned the legality 
of his initial actions, he believed 
that he had a moral duty as a 
Christian to help those in only 
applying for asylum, not helping 
them cross the border. He began 
noticing the increasing conflict in 
Central America; because of the 
complicit nature of the United 
States as well as its support for the 
Central American dictatorships 
(the large majority of the guerrilla 
groups were socialistic; therefore 
the 
Reagan 
Administration 

feared a communist state in 
Central America and supported 
dictatorships as an alternative). 
Reverend 
John 
Fife 
began 

recruiting other churches from 

across the American Southwest in 
making a coalition to help shelter 
and support the thousands of 
Central Americans crossing the 
border. His legal defense became 
one of morality and his belief in the 
church’s tradition for sanctuary. 
However, after receiving national 
media attention for his coalition’s 
work, the federal government 
began to question whether his 
movement was stretching the 
“leash” too much.

During the movement, and 

today, section 8 U.S. Code §1373 (a) 
is quoted as a counterargument to 
the sanctuary city movement. The 
code is as follows:

“A Federal, State, or local 

government 
entity 
or 
official 

may not prohibit, or in any way 
restrict, any government entity 
or official from sending to, or 
receiving from, the Immigration 
and 
Naturalization 
Service 

information 
regarding 
the 

citizenship 
or 
immigration 

status, lawful or unlawful, of any 
individual.”

In 
fact, 
Donald 
Trump’s 

executive 
order 
“Enhancing 

Public Safety in the Interior of the 
United States” used this clause 
as the basis to try and remove 
federal funding from sanctuary 
places. Though Judge William 
Orrick of the U.S. District Court 
for the Northern District of 
California ruled Trump’s move 
unconstitutional, the movement, 
in my view, has shifted from a 
religious rights to a states’ rights 
debate. In confirmation of this 
change, Orrick states the executive 
order might be an infringement 
upon states’ rights, writing, “The 
executive order attempts to use 
coercive methods to circumvent 
the Tenth Amendment’s direct 
prohibition against conscription.” 
Even after the ruling, the debate 
is continually “kicked down the 
road,” without many solutions on 
“how” we can fix the issue.

One partial solution is allowing 

immigration law to be amended 
by the states, not the federal 
government. The incentives differ 
greatly from state to state for refugee 
and asylum policy. If one were to 
compare the economic and social 
difference 
between 
Minnesota 

and Arizona with regards to 
immigrants, it doesn’t make sense 
for these two states to have nearly 
identical immigration policies. I 
do not disregard the need for the 
federal government to develop 
immigration policy that ensures 

equal protection for immigrants, 
but a “hands off approach” to states 
and their policies makes more 
economic and social sense.

The “why” in the sanctuary cities 

debacle truly racks my conscience. 
When reading 8 U.S. Code §1373 
(a), it is not difficult to see that 
these cities and counties are, in fact, 
undermining the law, without much 
reparation. However, as a person 
who started a refugee organization 
on campus named Refugees to 
College, I cannot in good conscience 
deny these individuals a place to 
grow as people. I think we should 
ask whether immigration law, to 
some degree, requires a suspension 
of natural ethics. How much can 
we extend our biological and moral 
leash? Before an answer can come, 
two developments, in my opinion, 
must take place in the United States 
with regards to refugee and asylum 
law. Firstly, the “leash” must gain 
a true meaning. At the moment, no 
side truly understands each other’s 
definition, if there is even one. The 
federal government, along with 
the cities such as San Francisco 
and New York, must define what 
“sanctuary” means.

I have often heard that sanctuary 

cities undermine those who went 
through the immigration process 
legally. However, many of these 
families, have been in the United 
States, undocumented immigrants, 
for decades (66 percent, in fact). 
It is unwise and ignorant to think 
that uprooting established families 
is a beneficial action for our global 
society. We have not only a moral 
obligation, but also an opportunity 
to extend our biological leash. It 
is in not only our best interest as a 
country, but also as moral beings.

In 2014, an academic paper called 

‘The neural basis of the interaction 
between theory of mind and moral 
judgment’ was published. In it, 
humans are described as having 
an evolutionarily developed system 
for ethics. The legal leash, in this 
case, does not take into account 
these behaviors. Our biological 
leash is often constrained by legal 
procedure; therefore, a discussion 
of the two must come to the 
forefront of national discussion so 
that states, counties and cities can 
work with the federal government 
in 
developing 
comprehensive 

immigration 
reform, 
especially 

with regard to sanctuary cities.

Sanctuary cities and the legal leash
Dallas’s supreme taco

W

hen cornerback Jeremy 
Clark 
was 
selected 

in 
the 
sixth 
round 

of the 2017 National Football 
League (NFL) Draft by the Seattle 
Seahawks, 
Michigan 
Football 

set a school record with eleven 
players being drafted. Ranging 
from Peppers at Pick 25 to Clark at 
Pick 197, the numerous selections 
not only indicate the talent that 
Michigan had last year, but also 
that the impact of the 2016-2017 
Michigan Football, which will be 
felt in the NFL for years to come. 
Some of these players will be 
granted the opportunity to make 
their teams to compete for playing 
time— immediately. Some will 
excel more than others. Tight end 
Jake Butt could compete instantly 
for a starting role in Denver; Ryan 
Glasgow could be a great defensive 
tackle 
for 
Cincinnati; 
Jabrill 

Peppers will be playing all over the 
field for the Cleveland Browns. 

While all of Michigan players 

are in positions to succeed, when 
looking back on this draft class, 
Taco Charlton will stand out 
from the rest. Taco Charlton’s 
combination of size, versatility and 
pass rushing skills will allow him 
to develop into both the star of the 
Dallas Cowboy’s defense, as well as 
the star from Michigan’s 2017 draft 
class.

When Taco Charlton went to 

the Dallas Cowboys at Pick 28, it 
seemed immediately like a perfect 
fit. Charlton was selected by a 
franchise that already had a good 
defense, but one that struggled 
at defensive end, where Charlton 
is 
projected 
to 
play. 
Sports 

Illustrated’s Chris Burke agrees, 
giving the pick an “A-” grade 
and saying that it “fills a need for 
Dallas, and at good value.” By being 
selected in the first round-which 
means the Cowboys view him as 
a potential cornerstone of their 
defense-as well as being selected 
by a team with a weakness at his 
position, Charlton will be given an 
opportunity to start from day one, 
a rare feet for a rookie.

What makes Charlton attractive 

to NFL general managers and 
coaches alike is his unique ability 
to both defend the run, and rush 
the passer from the defensive 
end position. In today’s NFL, 
there are numerous “specialists” 
at defensive end; players who 
can play only on running downs, 
and players who only come in to 
rush the quarterback in passing 
situations. But these specialists 

rarely can do both. Having a player 
like Charlton who fills both roles 
at once is a tremendous luxury for 
any NFL team to have. As a run 
stopper, Charlton possesses both 
ideal size (6’6”/275 lbs) as well as 
great technique. In this regard, 
Charlton has not only potential, 
but college statistics to back up his 
play. Last season at Michigan, he 
recorded 43 total tackles, including 
13 tackles for loss. Given his body 
as well as his commitment to 
improving his technique, Charlton 
should replicate this success at the 
next level.

Despite Charlton’s ability as 

a run-stopper, he was drafted 
primarily for his ability as an 
“edge rusher,” one of the most 
important positions in the pass-
happy state of the NFL. As a pass 
rusher, again Charlton’s 6’6” frame 
sets him apart, as will his wide 
wingspan. NFL scouts rave about 
Charlton’s “freaky athletic traits.” 
These traits, combined with expert 
pass-rushing techniques, will give 
Charlton the edge over the NFL’s 
lumbering offensive lineman. In 
college, Charlton led Michigan 
with a team-high 9.5 sacks this 
past season.

Despite 
his 
prospects, 
the 

biggest issue scouts had with 
Charlton was that he appeared 
to still be growing into his 
body. While these complaints 
are accurate, it was critical for 
Charlton’s draft stock that he 
played his best football at the end 
of this past season. Charlton began 
the season as a solid contributor 
to a dominant defense; he ended 
it as one of the defense’s biggest 
contributors. In the last regular 
season game against Ohio State, 
Charlton recorded 9 total tackles 
and 2.5 sacks. One month later, 
Charlton added 5 more tackles 
and another sack in Michigan’s 
bowl game against Florida State. 
Charlton made the biggest impact 
in Michigan’s two biggest games 
of the season, against the two best 
teams Michigan played, in the last 
two games of the season. The arc 
of his season illustrates not only 
his improvement while he grows 
into his enormous body, but also 
his willingness to work hard to 
improve his game and compete on 
the highest level.

‘Snatched’ gives 
empty laughter

By ARYA NAIDU

Daily Arts Writer

Following the blatant wildness of 

his last movie, “The Night Before” 
(2015), director Jonathan Levine’s 
“Snatched” eases up on comic raun-
chiness, instead striving to be a 
wild, yet touching, take on a mother-
daughter vacation gone wrong.

The beginning scenes show Emily 

Middleton (Amy Schumer, “Train-
wreck”) preparing for her upcoming 
romantic getaway to South America 
with her boyfriend, Michael (Randall 
Park, “Trainwreck”). She’s promptly 
dumped, leaving her begging for 
her homebody mom (Goldie Hawn, 
“The Banger Sisters”) to fill the non-
refundable space.

Hawn’s Linda Middleton reluc-

tantly agrees, and the disastrous holi-
day ensues. Emily meets hot stranger 
James (Tom Bateman, “B&B”) at 
their resort, and she and her moth-
er get kidnapped because that’s 
what happens when you try to have 
adventures with hot strangers in 
foreign countries. They ride around 
in trunks, accidentally kill South 
American mobsters and spend 20-ish 
minutes designing an escape with a 
useless and relatively unnecessary 
Christopher Meloni (“Holding Pat-
terns”) — you know, vacation things.

Both leads are 

basic 
enough 
to 

be 
unsurprising 

— neither Emily 
nor Linda have the 
character 
depth 

to make the film 

complex — and the film doesn’t 
have the intricacy to make them any 
deeper. Schumer is the blunt force 
fans love her for being, playing the 
ditzy, social-media-obsessed gal who 
drinks too much and feels the need to 
yell everything. Hawn is the cautious 
mother, never taking risks and being 
overly-critical of her daughter’s life 
choices. They have their differences, 
they argue about these differences 
with harsh words and poorly-timed 
wisecracks in an underwhelming 
jungle scene, one of them sacrifices 
themselves to prove their love, their 
relationship is then fixed and they 
party together forever. Easy.

While the heart of the movie is in 

Emily and Linda, the film’s support-
ing characters are arguably its best 

parts. Ike Barinholtz’s (“Storks”) Jef-
frey Middleton, Emily’s agoraphobic 
and laughably charmless brother, sits 
at home, repeatedly harassing the 
State Department via telephone. His 
never-ending efforts to save his fam-
ily, combined with the way he chirps 
“Mama” every 10 minutes, makes 
Barinholtz one of the brightest tal-
ents in the film. Perfectly understat-
ed, he earns himself a place among 
the top funniest actors on camera by 
not overdoing a plight to get there.

Ruth (Wanda Sykes, “Bad Moms”) 

and Barb (Joan Cusack, “Popstar: 
Never Stop Never Stopping”) are two 
platonic vacationers who meet the 
ladies at their resort. They’re eccen-
tric and entirely neurotic, with Ruth 
barely introducing herself before rat-
tling on about the statistics on being 
kidnapped. She’s funny, as is to be 
expected of Sykes’s characters, but 
next to Barb, it’s hard to concentrate 
on what she’s saying.

Maybe I’m just writing this 

because I’ve absolutely adored Joan 
Cusack ever since she tepidly flipped 
out over Stevie Nicks in “School of 
Rock,” but she was the funniest part 
of this film. An elusive badass, she 
has zero lines because Barb’s past 
involves her having cut her own 
tongue out after being tortured for 
information. It’s a dumb backstory 
in a dumb movie, and I loved it all. 
To compensate for her lack of talk-
ing, Cusack brings such a gusto to 
her ridiculously aggressive body lan-
guage and contorted facial expres-
sions. Silently, she renders the loudest 
laughs of everyone on screen.

Released Mother’s Day week-

end, the main pitfall of “Snatched” 
is that it tries too hard to be more 
than just a kidnap romp. The focus 
of the movie is diluted, wanting 
to be Emily and Linda’s relation-
ship yet overflowing with outra-
geous situations and the comedic 
life forces of its focal actors. Stir-
ring lines are somewhat muddled 
by the brash wit that always seems 
to exude from Schumer, creating 
a few moments when the film was 
reaching too far to be heartwarm-
ing. The unbelievable situation 
these women are in lends itself to 
crafting a light-hearted summer 
flick. Sitting safely in this zone, it 
doesn’t need to strive to be any-
thing bigger. It’s entertaining, and 
that’s enough.

Season 2 
Review

Netflix

By ANAY KATYAL

Managing Arts Editor

Empathy. It’s a badge that “Mas-

ter of None” wears with pride 
throughout its second season.

While the show’s first run has 

been continually lauded for its keen 
ability to dissect the simultaneously 
absurd and depressing tropes of 
modern millennial life, it also had a 
tendency to adhere to a rather stale 
thematic formula for our protago-
nist, Dev (Aziz Ansari, “Parks and 
Recreation”), to convey his malaise 
and misgivings about his profession-
al, familial and 
romantic future. 
That isn’t to say 
that 
the 
tried-

and-true sitcom-
esque format that 
co-creators Alan 
Yang and Ansari 
tried to employ 
throughout 
the 

first season was 
objectively bad — 
far from it, really.

For what the season was — at its 

simplest form, a method of living 
vicariously through a young man’s 
path toward self-discovery and pur-
pose — the format found itself at 
home. But for the considerably bold-
er direction that Ansari and Yang 
sought to further move Dev’s story 
in, it was only fitting that the show’s 
second iteration graduated to some-
thing grander. Hell, Season two’s 
opener essentially fashions itself as 
a modern parody of early-20th cen-
tury Italian film “Bicycle Thieves” — 
black and white filmography and all.

Auteur-ish 
creative 
liberties 

aside, the tone the program aims to 
set becomes obvious fairly early-on. 
While the program’s first season 
covered the ingrained anxieties 
that come with the journey towards 
(in the very least, the concept of) 
becoming an “adult,” its second sea-
son makes it a point to highlight the 
very real social and mental anguish 
of modern-day adulthood rarely 
explored in television. The Dev 
Shah of Season one is a confused 
actor who doesn’t really know what 
he wants out of his life, but the Dev 
Shah of Season two is thrust with 

very real, difficult deci-
sions and compromises 
he has to make to stay 
on the long-term path 
he finally manages to 
start forging for him-
self. What Dev wants 
and what Dev needs are 
rarely the same thing, 
and these quandaries 
fashion themselves a 
pointed 
illustration 

of what adulthood in 

today’s day and age can actually 
look like. There are laughs, there 
are jokes — but there are also very 
real moments of mental grief that 
can speak to most viewers’ everyday 
experiences as adults, regardless of 
creed or color.

These themes are explored in 

a variety of directions throughout 
the season — and the multi-faceted 
cast Ansari and Yang employ to 
illustrate these themes manages 
to instill an overarching sense of 
empathy that permeates throughout 
the program as well. In “New York, 

I Love You,” a vignette of storylines 
involving a deaf biracial couple, a 
group of African taxi drivers and 
an overworked Manhattan high 
rise doorman intersect in a way that 
sees audiences experience familiar 
emotions from perspectives they’re 
rarely afforded exposure to. In the 
poignant “Thanksgiving,” Denise 
(Lena Waithe, “Transparent”), a 
childhood friend of Dev’s, and her 
mother are shown to slowly come to 
terms with each other’s differences 
in personality and identity over the 
course of a decade of Thanksgiv-
ing dinners. Both episodes are the 
strongest exercise in Ansari and 
Yang’s creative liberties, and consid-
ering the stories they told (and the 
audience takeaways), they make for 
gems that represent what much of 
the rest of the season is all about.

All in all, “Master of None” pro-

vides no antidote for these very real 
modern conundrums. You’d be mis-
taken in thinking that was its pur-
pose, though. The program shows 
that such dilemmas are genuine and 
real, and happen to families of color, 
to young adults, to geriatrics, to gay 
and straight individuals alike. The 
program provides no real resolu-
tion for its overarching storyline, 
but its conclusion functions as an 
exercise in audacity — and it pays 
off. Ansari and Yang show no hesi-
tance in posing difficult questions 
in every corner of the show, but it 
doesn’t seem as if they’re attempt-
ing to provide answers. If any-
thing, “Master of None” shows us 
that coming to an answer may not 
nearly be as important as dwelling 
on the question.

‘The Wall’ is atypical

‘spin’ is a welcomed emo 
album by Tigers Jaw 

ROADSIDE ATTRACTIONS

Aaron Taylor-Johnson in combat position

BLACK CEMENT RECORDS

Both members of Tigers Jaw 

By SAM LU

Daily Arts Writer 

When 
listening 
to 

Tigers 
Jaw’s 
newest 

release, it’s pretty obvious 
that some drastic changes 
have occurred since the 
group’s infancy. spin car-
ries the same bright emo 
spirit that was first intro-
duced with the release 
of Tigers Jaw’s self titled 
album, but with a notice-
ably softer tone; the vocal 
overlays used in many of 
spin’s tracks are remi-
niscent in tune of a more 
punk version of Oh Won-
der’s material.

In 2013, when three 

of its five members left 
the group, fans thought 
Tigers Jaw was breaking 
up indefinitely, but Ben 
Walsh and Brianna Col-
lins continued the group 
as a duo. spin is their sec-
ond release since 2014’s 
Charmer, and is complete-
ly different from any of the 
band’s discography from 
before their reform. The 
album opens with “Fol-
lows,” a track that strikes 
a perfect balance between 
aggressive emo and weepy 
angst. Walsh’s voice is 
effortless and consistent 
as he sings, “I should have 
listened to you when you 
said / Nothing will make 
this easier,” simple lyr-

ics that frame the easy 
listenability of the rest of 
the album. “Favorite,” the 
second track of the album, 
has a faster, bass pow-
ered beginning. The song 
expands on the same mel-
ancholy wistfulness that 
first appears in “Follows” 
and extends to the rest of 
the album.

One of the benefits of 

Tigers Jaw’s reform is 
the way it emphasizes the 
contrasts 
between 
Col-

lins’s and Walsh’s voices. 
Like the albums that came 
before it, Walsh provides 
main vocals for some of 
spin’s tracks, while Col-
lins heads some for others; 
the greatest differences 
come from the harmonies 
between their voices. In 
comparison to the albums 
from 
before, 
spin 
has 

more songs where Col-
lins and Walsh have their 
voices overlaid, such as in 
“June” and “Escape Plan.” 

The layered effect is not 
only scintillating but also 
intoxicatingly difficult to 
stop listening to.

spin also makes good 

use of contrast between 
songs; “Bullet,” one of 
the more acoustic tracks 
on the album, is sand-
wiched between “Guard-
ian” and “Brass Ring,” two 
tracks that are sonically 
distanced from the soft 
acoustics in between them. 
Walsh’s sweet tone and 
deeper octaves in “Bullet” 
draw out the intensity and 
smooth reach of Collins’s 
voice in “Brass Ring.” In 
“Bullet,” the lyrics are

By JEREMIAH VANDER-

HELM

Daily Arts Writer 

For a movie that is, by 

all appearances, a war 
thriller, “The Wall” has 
an almost anti-cinematic 
plot. It focuses on a soldier 
(Aaron 
Taylor-Johnson, 

“Nocturnal 
Animals”) 

fighting in Iraq in the late 
2000s who is pinned down 
behind a wall and eventu-
ally engages the sniper 
(Laith Nakli, “24: Lega-
cy”) trying to pick him off 
in a conversation over 
radio. That’s it. That’s the 
story. So much of it is reli-
ant on performance and 
dialogue that it at times 
feels like a one man play.

This is shocking con-

sidering it comes from 
director Doug Liman, the 
man behind over-the-top 
action flicks like “Edge 
of Tomorrow” and “Mr. 
and Mrs. Smith,” as well 
as the less excessive but 
still action-packed “The 
Bourne Identity.” Liman 
shows great restraint here, 
relying on sound more 
than his usual hyper-styl-
ized editing. It may sound 
like an odd thing to com-
pliment a movie on, but the 
use of sound in “The Wall” 
— the whizzing of bullets 
passing by, the cracking 
of a rifle — becomes very 
important to both the 
story and the tension. In 
an early scene that finds 
Taylor-Johnson’s 
Isaac 

dodging sniper fire, view-
ers learn to fear the sound 
of the bullets’ impact even 

more than the report that 
follows it. It is this matu-
rity that first begins to set 
“The Wall” apart.

What ultimately makes 

this an atypical war film 
are its Gothic and Roman-
tic undertones. “The Wall” 
is heavily influenced by 
these genres of classic 
literature, especially the 
stories of Edgar Allan Poe, 
and it wears these influ-
ences on its sleeve. Dur-
ing the course of their 

conversation, Isaac and 
the sniper reference “The 
Tell-Tale Heart” and “The 
Raven” — a bird that, 
along with its caw, makes 
several appearances as the 
story wears on. A focus is 
placed on fear. Characters 
hold dark secrets. It may 
be missing a classically 
gothic setting, but that 
doesn’t make the homages 
in Dwain Worrell’s (“Iron 
Fist”) script any less clear.

It also bears saying 

that, for anyone with any 
doubt 
left 
over 
Aaron 

Taylor-Johnson’s versatil-
ity as an actor, his work 
in “The Wall” is further 
proof. Fresh off his award-
winning performance in 
“Nocturnal Animals,” he 

gives a similarly animal-
istic turn, but driven by a 
will to survive and outwit 
his opponent rather than 
random acts of evil. Credit 
is also due to Nakli for 
constructing a terrifying 
antagonist despite never 
once appearing on screen.

There are a great deal 

of positives to “The Wall,” 
which makes the later 
scenes that undo much of 
the good work done previ-
ously — particularly with 
relation to Isaac’s char-
acter arc and the gothic 
stylings — all the more dis-
appointing. It’s impossible 
to discuss in detail with-
out delving into spoilers, 
but a certain pointless-
ness seems to settle over 
the whole affair. Earlier 
scenes lose their impact, 
and the script never quite 
regains its footing going 
forward.

That isn’t to say that 

“The Wall” is complete-
ly ruined by those later 
scenes, but the lack of 
any 
deeper 
resonance 

as it rolls to a close does 
make it harder to recom-
mend. Ultimately, it’s still 
salvageable, 
though, 
if 

only by the strength of 
Taylor-Johnson’s perfor-
mance and the unique-
ness brought by Liman’s 
direction and the unusu-
al influences. If you’re 
looking for a flashy war 
movie with explosions and 
shootouts galore, you may 
wish to look elsewhere. 
But for those who want a 
quieter but no less intense 
thriller, this is definitely 
one to check out.

Balancing relevance with salience

W

hen a story first 
breaks, 
every 

newspaper, 

television station and magazine 
rushes to cover it. There’s a big 
to-do about it for a few weeks, 
with round-the-clock coverage 
that attempts to get at a story 

from 
all 
angles. 
Something 

big has just been exposed and 
everyone wants to be the among 
the first to cover the story. But 
then the next story breaks and 
we’re onto new headlines. And 
while 
reporters 
continue 
to 

cover stories no longer making 

headlines, and organizations are 
created to bring justice to those 
whom it affected, for the most 
part, these stories are old news.

When the Flint water crisis story 

broke — though it began arguably 
long before the story made it to the 
public — it was all over the news. 

You couldn’t flip to a newscast 
and see anything but the story’s 
developments. Overtime, however, 
media attention dissipated, and 
so did everyday conversations. As 
much as I don’t like to admit it, my 
mind certainly began to drift to 
other breaking events.

But after talking about the 

Flint water crisis in class, I did 
some Googling and found that the 
Michigan Civil Rights Commission 
issued a report in February of 
2017, naming “systemic racism” 
as the reason why the Flint crisis 
happened and why it went on for 
so long. As one of the Editorial 
Page Editors of the Michigan 
Daily, I thought that it would be 
an important thing to discuss 

with our Editorial Board. But as 
February turned into March, and 
March into April, and other issues 
on campus took priority, concerns 
about how relevant an editorial 
about the Flint water crisis would 
be became significant. 

We never ended up writing an 

editorial on it, but it got me thinking 
and there were nights I would lay 
awake, wishing, even weeks and 
months after the report was issued, 
that we’d talked about it. Reflecting, 
I realize that learning to strike a 
balance between making sure what 
we are talking about is current 
and not forgetting to talk about 
something that will be constantly 
important, is something I struggle 
with as an Editorial Page Editor. 
More broadly, it made me think a lot 
about society’s tendency to forget 
about some issues as new “breaking 
news” surfaces.

News organizations structure 

their newscasts and lay out their 
print pages with their readership 
as a top priority. Stories they think 
the general public will think are 
most important go in the most 
prominent spots on the page. The 
stories that get the most views will 

go first in the broadcast. Therefore, 
it would be almost impossible to 
ask for change at an organizational 
level, when, and rightfully so, they 
must appeal to the interests of the 
general public. 

Wanting to keep takes “fresh” 

and making sure the stories we 
are publishing are “relevant” are 
two main journalistic goals, and 
important ones at that. In the 
Opinion section, we must constantly 
make hard decisions about what we 
are going to write editorials about. 
I fully recognize constraints that 
reporters and news organizations 
are under. Some stories push others 
to the back burner, and to attract 
viewers, you can’t have the same 
stories over and over again. But 
just because something such as a 
new report about Flint, is no longer 
making front-page news, it doesn’t 
mean we no longer need to discuss it. 

The change we seek will not 

come from news media alone.

And while I believe it is important 

for the news media to constantly 
reevaluate how they handle tough 
stories, as a society, we must push 
back against the need for “relevancy” 
as we see it now. Society is frequently 
looking to answer the question 
“what’s next?”, and “moving on” 
is a mantra drilled into our heads. 
But I encourage us to ponder, just a 
moment longer, when someone tells 
you something is no longer relevant, 
or it’s too late or we should move on. 
The Flint water crisis, and events of 
this magnitude, are all too important 
to become issues of the past. This 
crisis, in particular, has permanently 
changed the lives of Flint residents 
who still struggle to obtain clean 
drinking water, whose children have 
been exposed to lead and must now 
grapple with the severe long term 
health effects. 

The news media and society 

as a whole need to begin to think 
more consciously about what are 
we sacrificing by feeding into our 
desire for short soundbites when 
these events deserve lengthier 
discussions. We need to continue 
to pay attention to them even after 
we have seemingly “moved on” to 
another story, especially when 
it is something as important as 
the Flint water crisis. Otherwise 
we will continue to perpetuate a 
cycle that allows critical issues to 
get left behind.

ANNA POLUMBO-LEVY| COLUMN


By ADAM BRODNAX

Senior Michigan in Color Editor

Dear Me,
It’s 
been only six days 

since you came into my life and I 
keep replaying those 20 minutes 
the hospital gave us to breath in 
the same air.

Once I learned the news that 

for certain you and the rest of 
my immediate family were alive, 
I wrote to myself that I was 
scared. I kept projecting and fan-
tasizing about the visit. I began 
layering moments and expecta-
tions of what my imagination 
could drum up. Then, I realized 
that there was nothing imagin-
able that would prepare me for 
the physical, mental and emo-
tional shouldering this would 
bear. It wasn’t until a few days 
before my flight where I chose to 
just be during my visit. The U.S. 
has gotten me into this habit of 
always going and while in Viet-
nam, I needed to just be. Yet the 
consequences of that decision 
have been overwhelming these 
past couple of days as I continue 
this cycle of emotional pushing 
and pulling.

Before I left for my flight, I had 

to steady myself. So, I did simple 
things — I cut my hair short, I 
bought contacts, I packed plain 

T-shirts. I’m not sure if it was 

more for you or more for me, but I 
did it to push away what America 
gave me. Growing up, I’ve always 
had to negotiate which parts of 
my identity I bring in and which 
parts I suppress. So, for our visit, 
I did these simple things just to 
get closer and to make myself 
more accessible to you.

Recollecting my arrival, I 

didn’t 
realize 
the 
immense 

weight of my visit. It was filled 
with jubilation and celebration, 
but also, with the unpeeling of 
an emotional scar. I was meet-
ing family member after family 
member. I was posing for photos, 
people were feeling my face and 
my brother referred to me only 
as “baby.” There was a living 
narrative in the town that I had 
returned home and that the fam-
ily had been unified. I remember 

To the mother who birthed me

PHOTO BY JIN KIM

 Adam, his birth mother, his biological brother, his sister-in-law

being asked by my sister-in-law 
if I was going to come home after 
school to work here and take care 
of you. I had a hard time articu-
lating the many emotions pull-
ing me in that moment, because I 
hadn’t even begun to think about 
visiting again and if I did, I knew 
it would only be temporary.

Me, this visit was unfair to 

you. Of the 14 hours I was in 
Thái Bình, the circumstances of 
our lives only gave us 20 min-
utes to fit an entirety of a life. 
The security nearly didn’t let me 
in, if it hadn’t been for the des-

peration in my family’s voice. I 
began to juggle what I wanted 
to ask you. I became anxious to 
tell you about my American life. 
I wanted to tell you about my 
mother in America who is so 
strong and raised me to be the 
person you met. I wanted to tell 
you what American air felt like. 
I wanted to tell you about the 
homes I grew up in and about my 
two siblings I love. There was no 
way to satisfy the many thoughts 
I had with the slight time we got 
to share. While I had this run-
ning list of questions, you man-

aged to encompass so much of it 
with the motherly wisdom I had 
always lived without. You only 
asked me three things: was I 
married, was I in school and did 
I eat every day. And to you, these 
three questions would just con-
firm the one thing you wanted to 
know — if I had happiness.

When I walked into the room, 

I didn’t mean to make you cry. 
Dad had prefaced that you were 
very ill and in physical pain so 
the last thing I wanted was to 
add a layer of emotional pain. 
You had so much trouble looking 
at me. The emotional scar I left 
you began to bleed again. The 
interpreter told me that you were 
having difficulty speaking to me, 
because it brought back the pain-
ful moment when you decided 
you couldn’t keep me. You told 
me how difficult it was because 
you were physically too weak to 
take care of me and that at the 
time, you didn’t have the means 
to feed me either. You named me, 
“Ocean,” because I was so big.

You told me you could only 

care for me for 10 days.

I just want to let you know 

that you didn’t fail, mom. Giving 
me up was the most courageous 
and profound decision that any 
mother ever has to make. I will 
never be able to suffice for the 
life you gave me. I can never even 
conceive the process of emo-
tionally detaching yourself just 
enough to let me go.

I do want to let you know that 

I am happy. Because of you, I 
have the immeasurable privilege 
of being happy.

Happy Mother’s Day.
Yours with all the love I have,

I do want to let 

you know that 

I am happy.

Approaching 
the 
net, 
Alex 

Najarian half-volleyed the ball over 
the net, split stepped and prepared 
for the next shot. The junior scooped 
the ball and the backspin forced the 
ball to fall dead — clinching the No. 
10 Michigan women’s tennis team’s 
advancement to the Sweet Sixteen in 
the NCAA Tournament.

The beginning of the long road 

to a national championship began 
for the Wolverines when they 
opened up the first two rounds of 
NCAA Tournament play over the 
weekend. After a swift 4-0 win 
over Youngstown State on Friday, 
Michigan took on Kentucky and 
came away with a 4-2 victory.

The Penguins didn’t pose much 

of a threat to the Wolverines. After 
clinching the doubles point with 
a win at No. 1 and No. 3, Michigan 
moved on to singles with an 
advantage. Apparently it didn’t need 
it though, as Michigan took all six 
first sets. Sophomore Kate Fahey had 
an impressive day, dropping only one 
game.

Najarian and Fahey dominated the 

No. 1 doubles matchup after falling 
into a 40-0 hole in the first game. 
They rallied back to take the game 
and closed out the match, 6-0. Fahey 
followed suit in singles, taking the 
first set, 6-0, after a long rally which 
forced Youngstown State to mishit 
the ball into the net. Fahey almost 
finished her day without allowing 
her opponent to earn a single game, 
but made an unforced error on match 
point to make the score 5-1.

However, 
Fahey 
didn’t 
seem 

phased, as she won every point of the 
next game and took the match on a 

double fault from Dominika Lackova.

With Fahey swiftly off the court 

and freshman Chiara Lommer not far 
behind with a 6-2, 6-1 victory at No. 
4 doubles, it was a race to see which 
Wolverine could punch Michigan’s 
ticket to the second round. In the end, 
the honor was left to Najarian.

After controlling most of her 

match, she struggled to close it out 
in the end. It took her three match 
points, 
but 
Youngstown 
State’s 

offensive shot sailed wide, giving the 
Wolverines their fourth point.

Saturday’s matchup was sure to 

be a bigger test for Michigan as they 
faced the 17th-ranked Wildcats. The 
doubles point was highly contested 
and all teams took turns in the lead.

It appeared that No. 2 doubles was 

going to be the first off the court. The 
pair of sophomore Brienne Minor 
and freshman Chiara Lommer had a 
5-2 lead and match point, but Minor 
approached the net and volleyed it 
long.

The 
Wolverines 
didn’t 
seem 

worried, though, until Kentucky 
stormed back and won the next five 
games.

Minor had to serve the deuce point 

to send it to a tiebreaker or give the 
Wildcats the match, and she double 
faulted. Kentucky took the match, 7-5.

The No. 3 doubles pair of junior 

Mira Ruder-Hook and freshman 
Valeria Patiuk was the next off the 
court, just not with the result they 
wanted. Their Wildcat opponent 
intercepted the baseline rally and put 
the ball away at Ruder-Hook’s feet, 
taking the match, 7-5, and securing 
the doubles point for Kentucky.

Winning four of the singles 

matches was a tall task, but Michigan 
welcomed the challenge.

“We’ve lost a lot of doubles points 

this year, we’ve kind of figured out 
how to get four singles,” said Michigan 
coach Ronni Bernstein. “I feel like we 
gave it away a little, especially at two 
(doubles)… the (doubles) point, while 
it’s big, it’s just one point and there’s 
six points out there and I felt like we 
could still do it in the singles and that’s 
what I told them.”

The matches started off close, but 

Ruder-Hook and Lommer were the 
first to pull away, winning 6-2, 6-1, 
and 6-0, 6-4, respectively.

While the Wolverines had won 

four of the six first sets, it wasn’t 
guaranteed that the matches were 
going to stay that way. Minor fell 
into a hole early in her match, but 
after Kentucky lost a long rally and 
hit the ball wide to make the score 
4-3 instead of 5-2, the match turned 
around.

Minor took the first set, 7-5, and 

rolled to a 6-4 second set win. Clearly 
frustrated throughout her match, 
Minor was elated when her Wildcat 
opponent tried to run her back and 
forth on the baseline and ended up 
sailing it long.

Strapped with a 3-1 lead, Michigan 

needed one more win to advance. 
It seemed as if Najarian was going 
to close her match out easily — 
but faltered and was forced into a 
tiebreaker.

Fortunately for the Wolverines, 

Najarian cruised in the tiebreaker, 
winning, 7-3. She turned to the crowd 
and raised her arms in celebration.

“I mean, it was exciting,” Najarian 

said. “But it’s a whole team effort. 
It’s not just me ever, and even when 
I clinch it’s a whole team effort. 
Everyone 
watching, 
everyone 

playing, everyone’s giving their best 
effort. And that encourages me to play 
my best.”

Wolverines advance to Sweet Sixteen
BASEBALL
Michigan ends regular 
season against Spartans

“Pleased, but not satisfied.”
For Michigan baseball coach Erik 

Bakich, that’s been the theme all 
season. And with the 16th-ranked 
Wolverines (40-12 overall, 14-7 Big 
Ten) having reached the 40-win 
plateau for the first time since 
2008, those words may not be more 
applicable than they are right now.

“In college baseball, when a team 

achieves 40 wins in a regular season, 
I think you look back and probably say 
that they did pretty well,” Bakich said. 
“But it’s not a landing spot. It’s a place 
to catapult off from and keep moving, 
keep growing, keep getting better.”

And there aren’t too many teams 

more likely than Michigan to heed the 
call for continued improvement, even 
as the Wolverines prepare to finish 
off one of the most successful regular 
seasons in recent program history.

After all, they know better than 

anyone that nothing is ever set in 
stone, especially after their 2-9 finish 
last season knocked them out of 
postseason contention.

Michigan finished the 2016 regular 

season with a record of 36-21. Its worst 
possible finish this year is 40-17 — a 
record which would likely put it in 
the NCAA Tournament regardless. 
Most current projections have the 
Wolverines as a No. 2 seed in an 
NCAA regional. But to Bakich, those 
predictions mean little, especially 
considering 
what 
happened 
last 

season.

“I see the websites, but I don’t put 

any stock into (projections). It doesn’t 
have any impact,” Bakich said. “I think 
we’ve learned our lesson for looking 
ahead. We paid a pretty hard price 
looking ahead last year. That stuff 
will take care of itself, we’ll be in a fine 
position for all that stuff, but we’ll get 
there when we get there. Right now, 
it’s just Michigan State.”

Michigan’s 
regular 
season 

culminates with a three-game series 
against the Spartans, and there will be 
plenty at stake.

A conference title will be on the 

line, as the Wolverines sit a half-game 
behind Minnesota in the Big Ten 
standings.

Friday’s contest — sandwiched 

between two games in East Lansing — 
will, in all likelihood, be the last time 
the Wolverine seniors take the field at 
Ray Fisher Stadium.

And, of course, the in-state rivalry 

will generate extra intensity.

“They’re our rival,” Bakich said. 

“We’d play them in the parking lot if 
we could.”

Michigan and Michigan State (28-

21, 9-12) have already met this season, 
a 12-4 Wolverine victory on April 
18. But that game was a midweek, 
non-conference showdown — the 
atmosphere is undoubtedly different 
now.

Not only will Michigan State 

look to play spoiler for Michigan’s 
conference title aspirations, it will be 
fighting for its own postseason life. 
Northwestern and Purdue currently 
are tied for the last two spots in the 
Big Ten Tournament, which begins 
Wednesday in Bloomington, Ind. 
The Spartans are one game behind 
them — if they don’t take at least one 
game from the Wolverines (and likely 
multiple), their season will come to an 
end Saturday.

Michigan State is certainly capable 

of doing so, however, with a potent 
lineup that possesses four players 
batting above .320. The offense is 
led by outfielder Bryce Kelley’s .352 
clip, and has a conference-leading 
slugging percentage of .445. The 
Spartans’ pitching staff, led by left-
hander Alex Troop (7-3, 2.62 earned-
run average), ranks third in the Big 
Ten in ERA.

Without a doubt, Michigan State 

possesses explosive potential, and 
has the talent to go toe-to-toe with 
Michigan, 
especially 
considering 

the numerous external factors — 
the rivalry, the emotions the home 
finale will bring, the postseason 
implications.

But of course, the Wolverines are 

aware of that.

All 
season 
long, 
in 
pivotal 

moments, Michigan has thrived. It 
swept Oklahoma in its first matchup 
with a ranked team this season. It 
took off on a four-game winning 
streak after suffering a blowout loss 
to Rutgers and an outfield collision 
that injured outfielders Miles Lewis 
and Johnny Slater. And with its 
offense in a funk last week, having 
scored just 18 runs in six games, 
Michigan traveled to Purdue and 
completed a resounding sweep of the 
Boilermakers.

And this weekend, the Wolverines 

will have another chance to rise to the 
challenge and finish strong.

But no matter what happens, 

Bakich and his team probably won’t 
be satisfied.

Sereno claims Big Ten distance sweep

Just 200 meters separated Gina 

Sereno from history.

The Michigan senior had already 

won the 10,000 meter race Friday at 
the Big Ten Championships. And if 
she could pull away from a pack of 
seven on the final straightaway of the 
5,000 meter race, she would become 
just the third woman in history to 
claim conference titles in both races 
in consecutive years.

“I said, ‘if you want to go, you gotta 

go now’,” Sereno said. “And I just gave 
it everything I got.”

It turns out that was enough. 

Sereno surged into the lead out of the 
final turn, and outdueled Indiana’s 
Katherine Receveur to the finish to 
win the race with a time of 16:23.24, 
just five-hundredths of a second 
ahead of her Hoosier rival.

“I had no idea (that I won), 

honestly,” Sereno said. “I made the 
first move, and she made the last 
move. It’s hard to tell because I was 
just looking forward, and I don’t 
know if she let up or I surged.”

Sereno’s victory Sunday closely 

mirrored her 10,000 meter win from 
two days earlier. She stayed solidly in 
the lead pack for the majority of the 
race, and maintained her position at 
the front as the pace began to drop 
with a mile to go. She then made her 
move with half a lap left — a move 
she would repeat from the same spot 
Sunday — and outkicked Penn State’s 
Jillian Hunsberger and Indiana’s 
Margaret Allen to win with a time of 
33:53.02 and a two-second margin of 
victory.

“The last 200 meters I never really 

know what to expect,” Sereno said. “I 
always tell myself to just push harder 
and harder and harder until there’s 
nothing physically left in the tank.”

Sereno led for most of the 5,000 

meters, but surrendered the lead to 
Penn State’s Tessa Barrett, and later 
Receveur, late in the race. Despite 
her opponent’s surge, and possible 
fatigue from her efforts Friday, she 
maintained her composure and place 
in the pack, and was able to position 
herself for the home stretch.

“I just tell myself to keep my eyes 

on the back of the jersey in front of 
me and not let the distance increase 
between myself and that jersey,” she 
said. “I kind of imagine there’s a string 
between my forehead and the back of 
someone else. It’s about keeping a level 
head and maintaining focus.”

Not only did Sereno become the 

first woman since Michigan’s Mindy 
Rowand in 1989 and 1990 to win the 
10,000 and 5,000 two straight years, 
her distance sweep powered the 
Michigan women’s track and field 
team to a fifth-place overall finish at 
the Big Ten Championships, hosted 
by Penn State this weekend. The 
Wolverines’ score of 79 points was 54 
points behind the champion, Purdue.

Michigan’s performance was most 

impressive when considering it came 
into the meet fairly shorthanded, 
with injuries sapping the team of its 
usual depth. Perhaps most notably, 
junior Erin Finn — the runner-up in 
the 5,000 meters at the NCAA Indoor 
Championships earlier this year — 
did not compete due to injury.

“We didn’t have what we normally 

have, but the kids at the top did very 
well,” said Michigan coach James 
Henry. “That small group of young 

ladies held it down.”

That group — consisting of Sereno, 

juniors 
Claire 
Kieffer-Wright, 

Aaron Howell and Jaimie Phelan 
— contributed 50 points to the 
Wolverines’ total with five individual 
victories.

Kieffer-Wright took home the 

high jump title Saturday in a down-
to-the-wire battle, needing all three 
attempts to clear the barrier on 
three of her final four jumps. She set 
a personal best with her winning 
height of 1.84 meters (6.075 feet) — 
the first time she has surpassed six 
feet since high school.

In the heptathlon, Howell didn’t 

place first in any individual event, but 
claimed the title with a score of 5,359, 
winning by 36 points over Maryland’s 
Peyton Wade. Howell sealed her 
victory with a third-place finish in 
the final event, the 800 meters, while 
also placing second in the javelin.

Phelan 
continued 
Michigan’s 

distance dominance Sunday with 
her title in the 1,500 meters. After a 
conservatively-paced first three laps — 
no lap was run faster than 70 seconds 
— Phelan took off, running her final 
lap in 62 seconds to finish with a time 
of 4:21.17, just over half a second ahead 
of Penn State’s Danae Rivers. Just an 
hour after her victory, Phelan capped 
off her meet with a third-place finish 
in the 800 meters, just ahead of junior 
Jamie Morrissey in fifth.

Michigan’s 
five 
individual 

conference champions tied for the 
second-most in program history. But 
now, the Wolverines will seek to get 
healthy as the NCAA Preliminary and 
National meets approach, and they 
will hope for a total team effort at full 
strength.

KEVIN ZHENG/Daily

Senior Gina Sereno became just the second woman to win a Big Ten title in both the 10,000 and 5,000 two straight years.

MEN’S TRACK AND FIELD
Bastien, Ellis win Big 
Ten titles for Wolverines

With one event left in the 

decathlon — the 1,500 meters — at 
the Big Ten Championships, Steven 
Bastien sat in second place, trailing 
Nebraska’s Cody Walton by 137 
points. So the Michigan senior met 
with one of his coaches to formulate 
a plan.

“(The plan was) based on his 

personal best and based on what I 
needed to run, the type of splits I 
would need to run for each lap, and 
I just tried to execute that plan,” 
Bastien said. “(My coach), as the 
javelin finished, he immediately was 
like, ‘You have to beat Cody by 20 
seconds if you want to win’.”

A little less than halfway through 

the race, Bastien was well on pace to 
do so, with a 12-second lead over his 
Cornhusker rival. Coming into the 
final lap, Bastien had reached the 
margin he needed, ahead of Walton 
by 23 seconds. And he didn’t let up, 
as he cruised to a time of 4:36.01 — 
13 seconds ahead of second-place 
finisher Andrew Huber of Indiana, 
and 40 seconds ahead of Walton.

With his dominant performance 

in the 1,500, Bastien became just 
the second Wolverine to claim a 
conference title in the decathlon, 
with a score of 7,713 points. His 
decathlon 
championship, 
along 

with a record-breaking victory 
from sophomore Joe Ellis in the 
hammer throw, highlighted the 
Michigan men’s track and field 
team’s eighth-place finish at the Big 
Ten Championships, hosted by Penn 
State. The Wolverines scored a total 
of 64 points, 53 behind the victorious 
host Nittany Lions.

The decathlon victory is just the 

latest addition to Bastien’s legacy. 
The Saline product already holds 
Michigan program records in the 
heptathlon and decathlon, and won 
the heptathlon at the Big Ten Indoor 
Championships in 2016. He also has 
earned 
first-team 
All-American 

status three times, and qualified for 
last year’s United States Olympic 
Trials in the decathlon. But Bastien 
says that these accomplishments pale 
in comparison to what it means to 
him to be a Wolverine.

“Just 
running 
for 
Michigan 

and having success here has been 
an 
accomplishment 
that’s 
been 

really enjoyable,” Bastien said. “I 
don’t think one (accomplishment) 

stands out above any other. It’s just 
that being able to have success at 
Michigan has been really rewarding 
because of the history the school 
has, the individuals on the team and 
the coaches that I have. The whole 
atmosphere that Michigan offers is a 
fun place to have success.”

The running and jumping events 

proved most successful for Bastien. 
Along with his 1,500 victory, he 
won the 100-meter dash by .22 
seconds and the 400-meter dash 
by over a second, while outjumping 
his competitors in the pole vault as 
well. He also set a career-high in the 
javelin, while tying his career-best in 
the 110-meter hurdles. He even could 
have potentially recorded a larger 
score had it not been for unfortunate 
fouls in the long jump and shot put.

Ellis’s hammer throw title was 

the first time a Wolverine had won a 
conference crown in that event in 87 
years. And he won it in dominating 
fashion — with a heave of 70.98 
meters, he broke the program record 
— which he himself had set just two 
weeks ago — by 1.68 meters.

Ellis wasn’t the only highlight for 

Michigan’s throwers, who had an 
impressive showing as a unit. Junior 
Grant Cartwright set career-bests 
in both the discus and hammer 
throw, finishing third and fourth, 
respectively, in those events. He also 
finished fourth in the shot put, right 
behind redshirt freshman Andrew 
Liskowitz.

“To have my family here watching 

and supporting — for them being here 
all the way, my dad’s seen pretty much 
all my (personal records) from high 
school in the weight and hammer and 
now here,” Ellis said. “To have them 
and two of my brothers and my mom, 
words aren’t enough.”

Added Cartwright: “It’s just really 

special. The biggest thing is to be here 
with Joe — we’re brothers, we train 
together, we do everything together.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
distance 

contingent also made several key 
contributions, beginning with junior 
Ben Flanagan, who finished eighth 
in the 10,000 meters in his outdoor 
season debut. Graduate senior Ned 
Willig scored in two events — placing 
fourth in the 1,500 meters and fifth 
in the 800 — while junior Brennan 
Munley was eighth in the 800. Junior 
Connor Mora aided the effort with 
two sixth-place showings, in the 
3,000 meter steeplechase and 5,000 
meter run.

Offensive explosion 
propels Wolverines

Foerster conquers Betsa in upset

Two first-team All-Big Ten 

players. Four plate appearances.

Lea Foerster vs. Megan Betsa.
It 
was 
the 
game 
within 

the game during Michigan’s 
dramatic 5-4 defeat at the hands 
of Michigan State in Friday’s Big 
Ten Tournament quarterfinal. 
Foerster’s 
unstoppable 
bat 

against 
the 
Wolverines’ 
ace 

proved the difference in arguably 
the biggest win in Spartans 
program history.

In the second regular season 

matchup between the teams, 
Betsa got the best of Foerster in 
a big spot. With two outs and the 
bases loaded in the matchup in 
April, Betsa blew a 2-2 pitch past 
the Michigan State centerfielder 
to end the threat on the way to a 
5-1 Michigan victory.

“The past two games this year 

against (Betsa), she’s gotten me 
out of my zone,” Foerster said. 
“I’ve struck out quite a few times.”

In 
her 
two 
starts 
this 

season before Friday against 
the Spartans, Betsa totaled 31 
strikeouts and just two runs in 
her 14 innings of work in two 
convincing wins. 

But on this day, it was Foerster 

getting the best of Betsa, proving 

a menace atop the Spartans’ order 
— reaching base in all four of her 
at-bats — and paving the way for 
the win nobody could have seen 
coming.

She got the afternoon started 

by working a full count, finishing 
off her seven pitch walk with 
a defiant clap of the hands and 
gesture to her boosted dugout. 
Her approach and demeanor set a 
clear tone: Michigan State wasn’t 
here for a moral victory.

With one swing of the bat in 

her next at-bat, Foerster changed 
the entire game, shooting a 
deep fly ball to left field that just 
outreached a leaping effort from 
sophomore 
outfielder 
Natalie 

Peters. The ball ricocheted off 
the wall, scoring a runner from 
first. Foerster scampered into 
third base, and just like that the 
Spartans had a lead and, maybe 
more importantly, hope.

In her third plate appearance, 

Foerster continued her dominance 
of Betsa, lacing a line drive into 
right field for a clean single.

“I think typically things start 

(in your head) and then they affect 
your mechanics,” Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins said of Betsa’s 
struggles. “Whether you’re trying 
too hard, whether you’re trying to 
be perfect, whether you’re “Wow, 
you’re a good hitter, I better 

throw around her,” I’m not in her 
head, but I didn’t think she was 
herself tonight and I think she 
can throw better than she threw. 
But give credit to Lea Foerster 
and some of those kids, they were 
outstanding.”

Betsa struck out just six hitters, 

her lowest total in a six-plus 
inning outing all season.

In 
total, 
Betsa 
threw 
18 

pitches to Foerster, and got just 
two strikes past her. Foerster 
reached a full count twice on 
the 
Wolverines’ 
right-hander, 

including an epic seven-pitch 
battle in the top of the seventh 
inning. 

With the first two runners 

in the inning reaching base and 
Michigan leading 4-2, Foerster 
lined an RBI single into right field 
and advanced to second base on 
the throw. She would later score 
the game-winning run on a single 
from 
third 
baseman 
Kaitlyn 

Eveland.

Hutchins is famous for her 

depiction of softball as a “one-
pitch” game, intending to convey 
the scope with which a given 
game can change on a given pitch. 

But this game was determined 

in four at-bats. In 18 pitches. It 
was a battle of two all-Big Ten 
players, but Friday, only one of 
them proved that distinction.

Tuesday 
night’s 
matchup 

between the No. 16 Michigan 
baseball 
team 
and 
Eastern 

Michigan made their previous 
matchup seem like a distant 
memory.

The previous defensive slugfest, 

a 2-1 win in 13 innings, was put in 
the past, and the Wolverines (40-
12 overall, 14-7 Big Ten) rallied for 
a 12-4 victory.

“A form of toughness and being 

gritty and the things we talk 
about are being able to compete 
as hard as you can every game 
you play, regardless of if it’s in or 
out of conference,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “You got an 
opportunity to play, an opportunity 
to compete, a tough team is able to 
line up and go as hard and fast as 
they can with their best effort and 
best intent.”

The Eagles (21-32 overall, 12-9 

Mid-American) were the first to 
strike in the second inning when 
senior centerfielder Johnny Slater 
made an error and allowed John 
Montgomery to reach second base. 
It was followed by another double 
that went underneath junior third 
baseman Drew Lugbauer’s legs. 
Another line drive to centerfield 
would 
tack 
on 
another 
run 

for Eastern Michigan, but the 
Wolverines managed to escape 
with just a 2-0 deficit.

Fortunately for Michigan, it 

made up for its defensive mishaps 
by tying the game in the bottom 
of the second inning. Redshirt 
sophomore left fielder Miles Lewis 
notched the first hit — his first of 
four on the day — of the inning 
with a single to a diving second 
baseman. Sophomore designated 
hitter Nick Poirier followed Lewis 
with a bouncing ball that sailed 
just over the head of the second 
baseman, earning Poirier a single 
and a run batted-in. A sacrifice fly 
would later bring Poirier home to 
level the game.

It appeared the game was going 

to stay close, especially when 
Eastern Michigan added another 
run in the third inning with a solo 
home run over the left field wall. 
After giving up four hits and three 
runs in just 11 batters faced, junior 
right-hander Jayce Vancena was 
replaced by sophomore left-hander 

William Tribucher.

Tribucher faired much better 

than Vancena, giving up just two 
hits and earning five strikeouts 
through four innings. His stellar 
work on the bump propelled the 
offense to follow suit.

Impacting the game the most 

was Lewis. He went 4-for-5 with 
two doubles to right field and two 
singles — earning him three runs 
and an RBI. 

“Just being confident out there,” 

Lewis said. “Just attacking the ball 
instead of letting the ball attack 
you. …That’s the thing that kind of 
clicked for me tonight.”

Lewis wasn’t the only one 

leaving his mark on the game as 
four other Wolverines managed 
two hits each. Sophomore right 
fielder 
Jonathan 
Engelmann 

garnered a hit and an RBI with 
one swing of the bat as he had a 
solo home run in the bottom of 
the fourth inning — his second of 
the season. The Eagles’ left fielder 
clearly thought the ball was foul, 
but after Eastern Michigan’s coach 
had a word with the umpire, the 
call stood as it was.

Michigan managed to score in 

five of the eight innings where 
they were on offense, and the sixth 
inning was the most eventful. Five 
batters stepped up to the plate 
before Eastern Michigan could 
record an out, and four more runs 
were added by the end of the 
inning.

With the Wolverines up 12-3, 

it allowed them some room to 
make defensive changes. Five non-
starters saw the field against the 
Eagles and freshman outfielder 
Dominic 
Clementi 
and 
junior 

catcher 
Brock 
Keener 
both 

notched a hit to improve their 
batting averages to .474 and .429, 
respectively.

While the victory against the 

Eagles means the Wolverines have 
reached 40 wins — something 
that hasn’t the program hasn’t 
accomplished since 2008 — it 
doesn’t mean they are stopping.

“It’s not a landing spot. It’s 

something to catapult off from, 
keep moving, keep growing, keep 
getting better,” Bakich said. “It’s 
been a season where the words 
‘Pleased, but not satisfied’ have 
been said a lot and ‘Finished 
strong’ has been said even more 
than that.”
