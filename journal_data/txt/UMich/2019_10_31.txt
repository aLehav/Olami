The University of Michigan 
has accepted an invitation 
to collaborate with the city 
of Detroit in building the 
Detroit Center for Innovation, 
it 
announced 
Wednesday 
morning. The $300 million 
research and education center 
will provide new programs 
and courses of study for both 
undergraduate and graduate 
students. 

University President Mark 
Schlissel explained in an email 
statement the location of the 
Center is key to furthering the 
University’s goal of fostering 
a collaborative relationship 
with 
Detroit. 
Additionally, 
he 
cited 
the 
University’s 
potential role as a “pipeline” 
to funnel innovation into the 
city to sustain it for years to 
come. 
“The center will help make 
our work in Detroit even more 
comprehensive, 
aligned 
to 
our mission, and responsive 

to 
local 
needs,” 
Schlissel 
wrote. “The Detroit Center 
for Innovation will further 
the economic development 
of the city and region. U-M’s 
role as the center’s anchor is 
to provide a pipeline of talent 
and platform for research 
collaboration to help grow 
and 
attract 
businesses 
and 
entrepreneurs, 
while 
positioning 
the 
future 
workforce for success in a 
dynamic 
and 
diversified 
economy.”
The new center will be 

situated 
on 
a 
failed 
jail 
site located on on Gratiot. 
The 
construction 
of 
the 
penitentiary was halted in 
June 2013 when the building 
process pushed the budget $91 
million over the $300-million 
budget. 
Since 2013, the half-built 
jail has remained abandoned 
on the lot.
The site will be anchored 
by 
a 
190,000 
square 
foot 
research and education center.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Michigan Men, a University 
of Michigan program designed 
to promote open conversations 
around 
masculine 
identity, 
is preparing to welcome its 
second cohort of students to a 
seven session series exploring 
definitions of manhood. The 
initiative was founded two 
years ago as a collaboration 

between the Sexual Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness 
Center, the Office of Student 
Conflict 
Resolution 
and 
Fraternity and Sorority Life. 
OSCR Case Manager Jim 
McEvilly launched the program 
after being made aware of 
general 
interest, 
especially 
from the U-M Interfraternity 
Council, in masculinity work. 
McEvilly, who is also a clinical 
social worker, said he’s always 

been interested in masculine 
gender 
socialization 
and 
its real-world impact, so he 
began 
brainstorming 
with 
individuals within Greek life 
organizations. 
“Any 
time 
you’re 
doing 
community work, you never 
want to go to a community and 
say, ‘Hey, this is what we think 
you need, so we’re going to 
do this,’” McEvilly said. “You 
always have to partner with the 

community.”
Michigan Men is loosely 
based on a similar program at 
Northwestern University, but 
McEvilly said it’s been adjusted 
to the specific needs of U-M 
students. Within the last year, 
Michigan Men began offering 
sessions to organizations such 
as fraternities who express 
interest 
in 
talking 
about 
masculinity. 
The Center of the City Task 
Force 
met 
on 
Wednesday 
afternoon 
to 
discuss 
its 
upcoming open house, online 
engagement 
and 
possible 
installation of the DecaDome. 
The 
Task 
Force 
gathered 
at Larcom City Hall for its 
seventh meeting, a 10-person 
municipal committee created 
after local voters approved 
Proposal A to designate the 
library 
lot 
between 
Fifth 
Avenue and Division Street 
for plans to become a park and 
civic center commons.
After 
public 
comments, 
group member Norm Tyler 
presented the work of the 
Neighbors subgroup, which 
has 
evaluated 
comments 
from 
community 
sources 
by 
meetings, 
letters 
and 
email. One recommendation 
included 
having 
business 
owners and residents learn 
about 
the 
history 
of 
the 
block and evaluate favorable 
urban 
spaces, 
based 
on 
prepared photos, to envision 
possibilities for the library 
block. They evaluated the 
efficacy of this exercise in 
preparation 
for 
the 
open 
house.

About 50 people attended 
the second Central Student 
Government-hosted 
town 
hall to discuss preparations 
for 
the 
upcoming 
Presidential Debate next 
fall. The event consisted of 
student engagement-related 
activities where students 
could ask questions and 
discuss various aspects of 
preparations, as well as find 
out how to get involved in 
the event planning.
According to Catherine 
Carver, 
co-lead 
of 
the 
2020 Presidential Debate 
Initiative and the Events 
and Outreach Manager for 
Ford School of Public Policy, 
the variety of opportunities 
needed 
to 
prepare 
for 
the 
debate 
allow 
for 
engagement opportunities 
for 
students 
with 
a 
multitude of interests. 
“I think that part of 
the 
excitement 
for 
this 

is 
that 
there’s 
going 
to be such a myriad of 
volunteer 
opportunities, 
and 
helping 
students 
think outside of that very 
direct, sort of (idea) that 
your 
major 
equals 
your 
career,” Carver said. “So I 
think that it really allows 
for 
this 
extraordinary 
opportunity to engage in 
ways that students haven’t 
anticipated.”
 Carver said the debate 
preparation extends beyond 
the event itself.
“Many students, when 
they 
think 
about 
the 
debate, they think about 
that 
90-minute 
moment 
when the debate is being 
televised, right at 9 p.m. 
on 
October 
15, 
2020,” 
Carver said. “But in fact, 
one of the beauties of this 
particular opportunity is 
the ability to understand 
all of the different aspects 
that go into implementing 
something of this nature.”

Last 
week, 
Michigan 
lawmakers, including state Sen. 
Jeff Irwin and state Rep. Yousef 
Rabhi, both Ann Arbor democrats, 
introduced a set of bills that 
would promote investment in 
solar energy across the state. The 
legislation would offer economic 
incentives for Michigan residents 
who install solar energy systems 
on their properties. 
The 
Powering 
Michigan 
Forward package would address 
statewide 
regulations 
on 
residential solar energy production 
that lawmakers say are preventing 
the expansion of renewable energy 
investment. 
The package plans to shift 
residential solar energy production 

in Michigan from an “inflow, 
outflow” system to a net metering 
system. In an “inflow, outflow” 
system, residents with solar panels 
must purchase all their energy 
needs from utility companies at a 
retail rate and then sell the energy 
created by their solar panels back 
to the companies at a lower cost. 
In a net metering system, residents 
with solar panels only need to pay 
utility companies for the energy 
they consume beyond what is 
produced by their solar panels. 
Additionally, if the resident’s solar 
panels produce more energy than 
the resident consumes, the resident 
is able to sell the unused energy 
to utility companies that add the 
energy back to the grid. 
Rabhi introduced two House 
Bills 
last 
week, 
which 
are 
very similar to a set of bills he 

sponsored the last political term. 
The package is in response to a 
2016 energy law put into effect 
under then-Gov. Rick Snyder that 
changed Michigan’s regulation of 
residential solar energy production 
from a net metering system to an 
“inflow, outflow” system. 
“That is creating an economic 
environment 
for 
the 
people 
installing solar panels on their 
homes that is disfavorable and 
reduces the financial viability of 
those solar projects,” Rabhi said. 
“So that is a very bad system.” 
Rabhi’s first bill would repeal 
the language in the 2016 energy 
law that allowed the change from a 
net metering system to an “inflow, 
outflow” 
system. 
The 
second 
would require the Michigan Public 
Service Commission to develop a 
fair pricing system for solar energy 
that would reflect the benefit 
of residential solar panels. 
Rabhi said energy utility 
companies have expressed 
the greatest opposition for 
these solar energy investment 
bills, adding these companies 
will have ample time to weigh 
in on the proposed legislation. 
“This is an uphill battle, 
but I think it is an uphill 
battle that is worth fighting 
because, again, we are in dire 
need of a renewable energy 
future and this is how we get 
that,” Rabhi said.
John Benedict, a lecturer 
for the Program in the 
Environment, 
teaches 
a 
course 
discussing 
contemporary 
ecological 
issues. A major theme of 
the course is the pollution 
and habitat destruction that 
results from the extraction 
and use of fossil fuels, as 
well as the urgency to move 
toward 
using 
renewable 
energy sources such as solar 
power. Benedict said the 2016 
legislation hurt interest in 
renewable energy in the state.

“The legislation sounded like it 
might have been highly influenced 
by 
lobbies 
that 
didn’t 
want 
renewables to really blossom,” 
Benedict said. “This new legislation 
seems like it’s taking into account 
the idea that renewables are 
becoming more cheap, and if we 
get public investment in it, it just 
drives that system more.”
Benedict 
also 
said 
a 
net 
metering system is an essential 
step in allowing the public to have 
the power and government support 
to commit to sustainable energy 
sources.
“It’s just such a good incentive 
to having people invest in their 
own energy future,” Benedict said. 
“As opposed to leaving it up state-
level legislation which is going 
to mandate how our companies 
operate, like Consumer Electric or 
DTE.” 
LSA sophomore Fiona Lynch, 
a long-time Ann Arbor resident, 
said she is enthusiastic about a 
system that incentivizes Michigan 
residents to install renewable 
energy systems.
“I think it’s important for 
politicians to really give respect 
to the role that they’ve been given 
and start taking serious action 
because that’s what they’ve been 
elected to do,” Lynch said. “This is 
a big opportunity to actually make 
change, and so I think it’s great that 
it’s starting to happen and I hope it 
continues to happen.”
Rabhi added the Powering 
Michigan Forward package is part 
of a larger political movement to 
create and pass state laws focusing 
on sustainability issues. Even now, 
Rabhi is developing and will soon 
introduce another bill that will 
create a 100 percent renewable 
energy portfolio in the state of 
Michigan, meaning that all of the 
state’s energy will come from clean 
energy sources.

In addition to the academic 
portion of the building, the 
14-acre site will also feature 
residential 
units, 
a 
hotel, 
a conference center and a 
business 
collaboration 
and 
incubation space. Production is 
slated to begin in 2021. 
He went on to explain 
the 
center 
will 
provide 
degree programs through 
the University’s Ann Arbor 
campus 
tailored 
to 
the 
needs of the local economy, 
in the hopes of sustaining 
long-term growth for the 
city. 
“These 
could 
include 
senior-level undergraduate 
and 
graduate 
courses 
and 
stackable 
certificate 
credentials 
in 
highly 
relevant, 
growing 
areas 
such as mobility, artificial 
intelligence, cybersecurity, 
privacy, 
data 
science, 
financial 
technology, 
entrepreneurship, 
sustainability, 
and 
advanced manufacturing,” 
Schlissel said.
The 
development 
of 
the site will be funded in 
large 
part 
by 
donations 
from 
Stephen 
Ross, 
the 
University’s largest donor, 
and Detroit businessman 
Dan Gilbert, as well as other 
public and private funding 
sources. 
In a statement to the 
University, Ross expressed 
his donation to the center 
was rooted in his desire to 
give back to the city that 
made him into the man he 
is today.
“I spent my childhood 
and many of my young 

adult 
years 
living 
and 
working 
in 
Detroit 
and 
have long wanted to find a 
way to have a real impact 
on my hometown,” Ross 
said. “The University of 
Michigan helped spark my 
entrepreneurial spirit and 
nurtured my curiosity for 
all aspects of innovation, 
leading me to not only 
become a founder, but an 
incubator and investor in a 
variety of technologies and 
businesses.” 
The center’s development 
occurs 
in 
conjunction 
with other efforts by the 
University 
to 
expand 
into the city, namely the 
Detroit Center, Rackham 
Memorial 
Building, 
and 
“cradle to career” program 
at Marygrove College. 
Detroit 
Mayor 
Mike 
Duggan 
expressed 
excitement for the growing 
relationship 
between 
Detroit and the University, 
as it will allow the city to 
flourish in an era of rapid 
technological innovation.
“I am pleased President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
accepted 
the 
invitation 
to 
have 
U-M power this center,” 
Duggan 
said. 
“Detroit 
is the ideal location for 
this 
extension 
for 
the 
prestigious University of 
Michigan and will help 
keep our city competitive 
in the emerging industries 
of tomorrow.”
The 
University 
announced the Innovation 
Center 
would 
feature 
an 
interdisciplinary 
committee 
made 
up 
of 
faculty 
from 
the 
University’s 
three 
campuses, led by James 
Hilton, U-M Vice Provost 

of Academic Innovation, 
to 
develop 
academic 
programs 
and 
design 
the building in the most 
efficient way. Additionally, 
the faculty committee will 
convene 
to 
re-strategize 
every few years as an effort 
to efficiently target the 
most pressing issues of the 
surrounding community. 
However, not all were 
impressed 
with 
the 
University’s 
decision 
to 
take on such an expensive 
project, 
especially 
when 
the Dearborn and Flint 
campuses 
still 
lack 
significant 
funding. 
In 
response 
to 
the 
announcement 
of 
the 
Innovation 
Center, 
LSA 
junior and spokesperson 
for One University Amytess 
Girgis tweeted, “Perhaps 
the innovation of funding 
Flint and Dearborn.” 
In an interview with 
The Daily, Girgis cited the 
One University Campaign 
— a coalition aimed at 
increasing parity between 
the Ann Arbor, Flint and 
Dearborn campuses — and 
brought up that significant 
disparities 
still 
exist 
between students. 
While 
she 
commends 
the 
University 
for 
the 
important work they can 
potentially do in Detroit, 
she 
said 
she 
sees 
the 
University’s 
decision 
to 
invest so heavily in the 
Innovation 
Center 
in 
Detroit as misaligned with 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
campaign.
“We 
commend 
the 
Administration 
on 
its 
professed 
commitment 
to 
support 
the 
people 
and 
communities 
of 

Michigan,” Girgis said. “I 
just have to wonder why, 
if U-M is truly a public 
institution, it is allowing 
its 
Flint 
and 
Dearborn 
campuses to suffer from 
abhorrent lack of funding 
that it could very easily 
rectify? I guess the voices 
of students and faculty in 
these communities aren’t 
as strong as that of Dan 
Gilbert’s.” 
Some 
students 
also 
questioned the University’s 
decision 
to 
go 
into 
partnership with Ross and 
Gilbert. LSA senior Sharif 
Krabti said the University’s 
investment 
in 
the 
downtown area of Detroit 
as opposed to areas that 
receive less attention is an 
example of gentrification.
“I don’t really see how 
those two folks have a 
vested 
interest 
in 
the 
communities 
in 
Detroit, 
outside of the Downtown-
Midtown 
area 
and 
that 
business 
development 
there,” Krabti said. “It’s 
important 
to 
recognize 
— 
and 
the 
University 
really should know this 
considering its faculty are 
the ones teaching this and 
have 
this 
understanding 
— 
that 
business 
doesn’t 
mean that it’s going to be 
prosperous for communities 
that live there.”
Krabti, who participated 
in Semester in Detroit this 
summer, 
said 
there 
are 
Detroit-based 
initiatives 
the University participates 
in that help the city. He said 
this project, however, does 
not because it only benefits 
rich 
people 
and 
would 
rather see the resources in 
this project used elsewhere.

During the event, students 
were able to split off into 
small groups to discuss a 
variety of issues pertaining 
to 
debate 
preparation, 
including 
campus 
climate, 
volunteer engagement, voter 
registration, media literacy 
and post-debate events and 
programs. 

Students had the chance 
to share their ideas with 
the event organizers. CSG 
President 
Ben 
Gerstein, 
Public Policy junior, said 
the small group discussions 
were beneficial for hearing 
the thoughts of the student 
body.
“To be able to share 
out 
here, 
in 
the 
room 
specifically, what students 
are thinking, I think is a lot 

different than just having 
questions answered at a 
surface 
level,” 
Gerstein 
said. “I think it allowed for 
us to dig deeper into sort of 
some of the details.
LSA 
junior 
Bridget 
Corwin said her group on 
voter 
registration 
talked 
about 
how 
to 
increase 
student engagement with 
the 
democratic 
process, 
and said the smaller focus 
groups allowed students to 
share ideas on topics that 
they are passionate about.
“It was cool to have those 
small 
group 
discussions 
as 
well,” 
Corwin 
said. 
“Sometimes 
I 
don’t 
necessarily 
talk 
about 
the different aspects of 
voter 
registration 
with 
my friends all the time, 
and 
it’s 
something 
that 
I’m passionate about, and 
I care about, and I see it 
as an important aspect of 

just like civic and political 
engagement 
on 
this 
campus.”
According 
to 
Corwin, 
the group discussed why 
voter 
registration 
is 
an 
important conversation due 
to the political ideas being 
brought to campus with the 
debate.
“I also think it’s really 
important 
that 
people 
understand that they have 
a voice and they are able to 
use their voice and literally 
shaping what those debates 
look like,” Corwin said. 
“I just think that voter 
registration 
is 
a 
really 
important piece to that, and 
it really important avenue 
for getting people civically 
and politically engaged.” 
LSA 
freshman 
Russell 
McIntosh said his small 
group, 
discussing 
media 
literacy, 
highlighted 
various modern concerns 

and 
discussions 
of 
the 
current media landscape 
and political climate.
“Media is pretty much 
our greatest influence and 
controls the way we think,” 
McIntosh 
said. 
“TV 
is 
going to be a huge portion 
of the debate, so we talked 
about the importance of 
educating people about the 
turn of the fake news and 
what fake news really is. We 
talked about how Michigan 
is going to be targeted by 
certain outside influencers. 
So media is just going to 
play a huge role.”
Carver said the debate 
presents 
a 
unique 
opportunity for students 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
democratic process.
“Educational 
opportunities 
are 
about 
what 
you 
do 
in 
the 
classroom and what you do 
outside of the classroom,” 

DEBATE

The lecture began with opening 
remarks from CHEAR center 
director Lisa Prosser. Prosser took 
the stage to recognize Meiser, 
who founded the CHEAR Center 
Board of Advisors and for whom 
the center is named after.
Gordon began by addressing 
the current political climate, 
emphasizing the importance of 
simple and efficient change. He 
went on to identify the three key 
themes of his discussion: policy, 
process and personnel. 
“All of this sounds Hallmark 
simple, and it is,” Gordon said. 
“I 
think 
we’ve 
gone 
astray 
because we have made things too 
complicated and if we can stay 
anchored in simple ideas like these 
and if we can simplify the ways 
we do our work, we can activate 

a compelling agenda for reducing 
poverty and hunger.” 
Gordon then called attention to 
more specific issues in the process 
such as recent strides to move 
to self-attestation, which would 
allow low-income applicants to 
report their assets themselves 
instead of having to provide 
asset proof when filling out 
applications for benefits. Gordon 
said he believes the change to 
self-attestation would take away 
some of the stress from having to 
provide proof of assets. 
Gordon also spoke about the 
importance of good design when 
it comes to applications and 
processes, providing an example 
of a benefits application that was 
cut down from 42 pages — the 
longest in the country — to 18 
pages, making it more efficient 
for low-income families to apply. 
Gordon also talked about changes 
in website layout that would make 

it easier and quicker for applicants 
and caseworkers to read and fill 
out. 
“We should care about how 
things 
look,” 
Gordon 
said. 
“Design, as it turns out, is one of 
the ways that we treat people as 
equals.”
 Gordon closed his presentation 
with a call for hope, ensuring 
that although this type of work is 
difficult, it is worth it. 
“The public sector is often 
demonized. And a big part of 
my job is just reminding my 
colleagues that our work is among 
the most important work that 
there is,” Gordon said. 
Orringer, who has a specialty 
in pediatrics and a degree from 
Harvard Medical School, spoke 
on identifying food insecurity as 
a major indicator of child health 
as well as a social determinant 
for health. Orringer elaborated 
further on this topic, linking food 

insecurity to youth mental and 
physical health problems as well 
as family vulnerability. Orringer 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
advocating for children’s health, 
specifically 
calling 
on 
the 
engagement of hospital staff. 
“What’s really important on a 
clinical basis is to make sure our 
staff, our nurses, our medical 
assistants, our trainees that 
come through, and faculty all 
are sensitive to this issue and 
are aware of the screening for 
this, why we are doing it, why 
this is important, and what the 
resources are,” Orringer said.
Pilkauskas reiterated many 
core facts Orringer touched on, 
focusing on the policies that 
influence the prevalence of food 
insecurity. 

Michigan Men offers two 
formats of discussion: Michigan 
Man Box, a one-time 90-minute 
session, and Expeditions of 
Manhood, which consists of 
several sessions. 
In 
Michigan 
Man 
Box, 
participants 
explore 
expectations 
and 
messages 
they’ve 
experienced 
surrounding 
masculinity. 
McEvilly said two common 
themes that emerge during these 
sessions are the expectations 
of dependability and lack of 
emotional expression. 
Expeditions 
of 
Manhood 
consists 
of 
seven 
sessions 
that dig into the concept of 
masculinity more deeply, using 
Ted Talks, activities and open 
discussion 
and 
questions. 
McEvilly said participants work 
on creating their own definitions 
of 
masculinity 
and 
discuss 
self care, consent and healthy 
relationships. They also evaluate 
how masculinity plays out in 
their communities, particularly 
in fraternities. 
Engineering 
junior 
Ian 
Ross, who participated in the 
first cohort of Expedition of 
Manhood this past summer, said 
he believes men don’t talk about 
masculinity 
and 
masculine 
socialization as freely as they 
should. The program is designed 
to be peer-facilitated, making 
the conversations much more 
relaxed, honest and open, Ross 
added. 
“I feel like conversations 
about femininity happen on a 
more frank and open level,” Ross 
said. “Men don’t feel like having 
those conversations because it’s 
been programmed out of them, 
and when you start having them, 
it’s actually very, I think, freeing 
and rewarding because you 
get to look at yourself and your 
community in a very different 
light.”
McEvilly said it’s important 
to 
talk 
about 
masculinity 
because the effects of masculine 
socialization 
manifest 
themselves in a number of 
alarming ways. For example, 
men have high rates of substance 
use and abuse, are 3.54 times 
more likely than the general 
population to commit suicide, 
have a higher representation 
in campus judicial proceedings 
and are more likely to commit 
sexual violence. In addition, men 
form less complex social support 
systems than women and are 
less likely to reach out for help, 
especially from other men. 
“When you look at those stats, 
clearly something is going on, 
there is some kind of impact 
being 
felt,” 
McEvilly 
said. 
“Those are very, very powerful 
trends.”
Ross heard about the program 
through his Beta Theta Pi 
brother Sebastian Capp, one 
of the organizers and student 
facilitators 
for 
Michigan 
Men. Touching on why the 
Greek community has been 
so involved in Michigan Men, 
Ross said fraternities provide 
a unique environment because 
they put so many masculine-
identifying people in the same 
place, all under a common set 
of ethics. According to SAPAC, 
membership in all-male groups 
is linked to higher rates of sexual 
violence, one of the factors 
McEvilly linked to masculine 
socialization.
“There are definitely aspects 
of the Greek system and how 
masculinity plays into that that 
are interesting,” Ross said. “I 
think the fact that you have a 
lot of men in once space, the fact 
that you’re dealing with people 
at such a pivotal time in their 
life — the undergrad age is that 
across the board — and the fact 
that they’re all in that one space 

together, 
especially 
because 
they are under the context of a 
set of values.”
In particular, Ross said, he 
was struck by a session focused 
on male vulnerability.
“As men you’re taught not to 
be vulnerable, you’re taught to 
be very stoic,” Ross said. “Just 
having to have a space to talk 
about why it’s a good thing to be 
a little more raw and a little more 
candid about your emotions can 
be a very positive and productive 
thing.”
Although the program was 
designed for male-identifying 
people, 
and 
Michigan 
Man 
Box is offered solely to men, 
McEvilly said Michigan Men is 
open to connecting with people 
of 
different 
identities. 
For 
example, he’ll soon be holding an 
informational presentation for a 
group of cisgender women. 
“When it comes to designing 
this program and implementing 
this program, I don’t feel that it 
should ever just be cis men doing 
the work,” McEvilly said. “It 
needs to be informed by anyone 
who would like to inform the 
work. No one group could ever 
have complete ownership over 
this type of program.”
McEvilly 
said 
he 
wishes 
Michigan 
Men 
could 
reach 
more people on campus, but he 
and the other facilitators have 
to be realistic. Even if they 
involved every single masculine-
identifying 
person, 
McEvilly 
said, Michigan Men couldn’t 
completely reverse all harmful 
societal trends. He said the goal 
of Michigan Men is to at least 
start a conversation or spark 
some initial engagement. 
Commenting on how societal 
perceptions of masculinity are 
shifting, McEvilly said he hopes 
more men will start thinking 
about definitions of what it 
means to be a man. 
“I think conversations around 
masculinity are slowly, slowly 
changing.” McEvilly said. “I 
would say from the time that I’ve 
been alive, over the last thirty 
years or so, the general popular 
or cultural awareness around 
masculinity seems to be shifting 
and I think there’s a lot of 
reasons for that. I’m cautiously 
optimistic that as awareness 
grows, interest will also grow.”
LSA sophomore Maira Gajda 
echoed McEvilly’s sentiments, 
saying she thinks the idea of 
talking about masculinity is 
valuable in an ever-changing 
cultural environment.
“What it means to be a man 
is changing so much nowadays, 
that it’s really important for 
students to take a proactive 
approach to make the definition 
of 
masculinity 
something 
productive for themselves, for 
their communities, and for their 
loved ones and everyone around 
them,” Gajda said.
According to Ross, Michigan 
Men stands out because it 
doesn’t prescribe a certain set 
of beliefs or tell men who they 
should be. He said the main 
goal of the program is to help 
participants think about what 
aspects of their identities are 
intrinsic versus prescribed by 
societal expectations, so they 
can live their most authentic 
lives. 
“I think a lot of program 
offerings that the University 
has, students think of it under 
a certain context,” Ross said. 
“It’s 
the 
University 
saying 
XYZ, or there’s a clear opinion 
trying to come through the 
program. The thing I like about 
Michigan Men is that it’s about 
the people going through it, it’s 
about their identity, it’s about 
the conversation that you get to 
have. It’s you just having frank 
conversations about what you 
think, and no one’s going to tell 
you, you have to think a certain 
way.”

“What we do is we have 
a meeting, and we show the 
history of the library block 
first, and then we have them 
do an interactive exercise,” 
Tyler said. “And then, we find 
that people are ready to talk. 
If you just went into a meeting 
and you said, ‘Tell us what you 
think about the library block,’ 
they 
probably 
wouldn’t 
be 
good reference points, but by 
taking the time, they gradually 
open up, and we get a lot of 
comments.”

John 
Haines, 
another 
member 
of 
the 
subgroup, 
reflected on the addition of an 
activity survey as well as the 
urban spaces survey to have 
community members consider 
the activities they’d like to 
have in the community space. 
“The goal for us is to really 
generate discussion,” Haines 
said. “And while we did get 
some 
discussion 
after 
the 
urban 
spaces 
exercise, 
we 
thought maybe by describing 
activities people might be able 
to think a little bit more about 
what they might want to talk 
about.”
Next, 
the 
task 
force 

discussed 
the 
upcoming 
open house at the Ann Arbor 
District Library scheduled for 
Wednesday, Nov. 6 at 6 p.m.
The open house will host 
four 
stations: 
a 
welcome 
station, a definition station, 
an audience station and an 
experience station. 
Each station has an activity 
to 
stimulate 
conversation 
on defining the space of the 
library lot, considering who 
will use the space and how it 
will be used. 
After 
discussion, 
Task 
Force Chair Meghan Musolff 
expressed 
an 
optimistic 
outlook on the upcoming event. 

The event will have coffee, 
cookies and other snacks. 
“I’m feeling good about what 
our strategy is for this event, 
and we’ll see what we learn and 
move on from there,” Musolff 
said. “And as a reminder, we 
have another one in January, so 
I’m hoping, somewhere along 
the way, we’ll have a little bit of 
time to debrief to think about 
what we learned from this one 
and what our strategy might be 
for the next.”
The committee also talked 
about online public engagement 
to allow those who can’t make 
it to the event to participate, 
as well as discussion on the 

pop-up “idea pod.” The idea 
pod, a structure known as a 
DecaDome, is planned to be 
open in the library lot from 
Nov. 3 to 10 to allow community 
members to ask questions and 
share ideas. The task force is 
currently finalizing logistics. 
This 
idea 
was 
initially 
proposed 
by 
committee 
member 
Alan 
Haber. 
The 
committee considered alleged 
pushback 
from 
community 
members on the idea of the 
DecaDome because of its cost 
but concluded to review its 
efficacy 
after 
the 
planned 
week-long 
trial 
period. 
Committee 
member 
Ann 

Dilcher said she was looking 
forward to the activity.
“In my mind, I think it’s an 
activity to do, and that it is 
something that can come back 
to if we find it to be very useful. 
Or something else can take its 
place,” Dilcher said.
The 
group 
unanimously 
passed on the next task force 
agenda to debrief on the Nov. 
6 meeting, the DecaDome, 
targeted mailing and possible 
speakers 
from 
stakeholders 
with a vision for the library lot.

Indecision kills
I

n NBC’s popular sitcom, 
“The 
Good 
Place”, 
main 
character 
Chidi 
Anagonye 
finds 
himself 
in 
the 
show’s form of an 
afterlife as a result 
of 
his 
crippling 
sense of indecision. 
Chidi, 
a 
moral 
philosopher, always 
grapples with what 
the 
most 
“moral” 
decision would be. 
He finds himself in a 
personal stalemate, 
which 
often 
has 
negative 
repercussions — in his case, 
death — due to his inability to 
make a split-second decision.
In the show, Chidi often 
wastes time deciding which 
outcome may be the best for 
himself and those around 
him 
and 
often 
ends 
up 
frustrating everyone. Though 
my indecision has not reaped 
such serious consequences, 
I find myself in a perpetual 
middle ground between one 
choice 
or 
another. 
From 
having a hard time deciding 
which restaurant to go to, 
to deciphering where I see 
myself after college, I have 
this crippling inability to 
make decisions.
This sense of indecision, 
for me, is often coupled 
with the looming nature of 
uncertainty. 
I 
personally 
struggle with the grayness 
or lack of clarity that some 
decisions pose. If I go this 
route, will others be upset? 
If I choose this way, will 
others 
be 
happy 
at 
the 
expense of my discontent? I 
know I am not alone in this 
feeling. As students on this 
campus, we find ourselves 
making decisions that have 
the ability to impact our 
lives further down the road: 
what we want to study, what 
jobs we apply for, what clubs 
we join, how we choose to 
spend our free time and with 
whom. These are all choices 
that we make as students on 

this campus that have the 
ability 
to 
further 
impact 
our livelihoods, friendships, 
relationships, 
experiences 
and 
interests.
The 
sense 
of 
gravity that comes 
with the decision-
making 
process 
often weighs on me. 
Some choices have 
been 
incredibly 
clear, 
such 
as 
deciding what to 
major in (political 
science). Others have been 
faced with uncertainty — the 
constant back and forth, such 
as weighing the decision to 
venture across the country to 
go to school with no familiar 
faces or stay closer to home. 
There are times when I want 
to just randomly select one 
choice just to have a sense of 
finality on the issue at hand.
Obviously, these problems 

are not just left to the moral 
philosophers in sitcoms, but 
to all of us, whether we are 
hyper-conscious like Chidi 
or not.
Being an indecisive person 
can pose difficulties. Most 
of the time, we just need 
someone to suggest one of 
the options and say how 
they feel about it for you. Or 
maybe we need to use a pros 
and cons chart, if that can be 
an oversimplified, temporary 
solution. At the end of the 
day, 
though, 
a 
decision 
usually must be made. It 

cannot sit on the backburner 
forever, wilting away due to 
purposeful neglect.
As I have found for myself, 
this indecision can lead to 
what I call a “double loss” 
situation, in which both you 
and those around you are 
frustrated or discontented 
with your decision — or lack 
thereof. It is evident with 
Chidi in “The Good Place”, 
as he missed out on so much 
due to the copious amounts 
of time he spent trying to 
figure out what to do about 
something or in regard to 
someone. His friends, his 
family and even his students 
come to see his obsession 
with making the best choice 
all the time as a hindrance 
instead of a strength. I do 
not want to be a Chidi.
Sometimes 
I 
need 
to 
have faith that, despite not 
knowing how one choice 
may catalyze and influence 
future outcomes, it will work 
out. At the end of the day, 
we all face difficult choices 
at this pivotal point in our 
lives. I strive to be unlike 
Chidi, to not look back on the 
past with a sense of regret 
due to the amount of time 
spent toiling over decisions, 
instead of being able to find 
satisfaction with whatever 
I pick. I want to look back 
knowing that despite how 
tough one thing may have 
seemed in the moment, it all 
worked out in the end.
I was recently asked for 
a piece of advice that I 
wish I could give my past 
self. Without hesitation, I 
said, “Everything will work 
itself out in the end,” which 
surprised me. I hold this 
to be true, and hope that 
others who struggle with the 
big and little decisions on 
our campus and within our 
community can find this to 
be true as well.

How “exporting culture” could help China
T

he NBA’s recent dispute 
about Houston Rockets 
General 
Manager 
Daryl 
Morey’s 
Hong 
Kong 
tweet 
made 
the 
headlines 
as an example of a Western 
company bending the knee 
to China’s Communist Party, 
but it was less the exception 
than the rule. A number of 
Western companies have made 
alterations 
to 
appease 
the 
Chinese: Paramount removed 
the Taiwanese flag on Tom 
Cruise’s jacket in the “Top Gun 
sequel” and Disney scrubbed 
the heritage of a Tibetan monk 
from “Dr. Strange.” 
Clearly, when Bill Clinton 
said in 1994 that continuing to 
grant China the most-favored 
nation status in trade was “the 
best opportunity to lay the 
basis for long-term sustainable 
progress on human rights,” 
he was wrong. China has not 
made progress in the areas of 
freedom of speech or human 
rights and today, in addition to 
the unacceptable militarism in 
Hong Kong and toward Taiwan, 
China is running concentration 
camps holding upwards of a 
million people in Xinjiang — 
which is also the location of 
some NBA training camps. 
The expectation was that as 
American culture was shared 
worldwide, things like respect 
for democratic principles and 
support for liberty would be 
exported along with it. Just 
like 
Levi’s 
Jeans 
became 
commonplace, 
eventually, 
tolerance 
and 
respect 
for 
democratic 
institutions 
and 
principles 
would 
as 
well. 
However, this hasn’t happened. 
In an ironic twist, American 
companies getting involved in 
China have not made China and 
the Chinese people more free 
but have instead made America 
and Americans seem less free. 
What to do about this? There 
are 
two 
options: 
continue 
to do nothing until we get 
to the point where Stephen 
Curry and LeBron James are 
playing 
exhibition 
matches 
in concentration camps after 
delivering 
sermons 
about 
the importance of cultural 
tolerance, 
or 
show 
other 

countries why they should value 
liberal democracy and lead by 
example. The first option has 
the bonus of demonstrating 
how 
your 
cultural 
betters 
tend to be hypocrites chasing 
the almighty dollar, while the 
second would be better off for 
American power in the long 
run. 
America 
didn’t 
win 
the 
Cold War with military might 
and President Reagan’s lasers 
alone — though those were 
both big parts of it. A big part 
of it was another Ronald — one 
who showed that while eternal 
vigilance was once the price for 
freedom, it was now 3.75 rubles 
and came with a side of fries. 
Does this mean that the USSR 
fell because of McDonald’s? 
No — but it did fall because of 
what McDonald’s represented: 
a uniquely American strand of 
culture. McDonald’s (and other 
American cultural vanguards) 
were important because they 
were exporting the best of 
America rather than importing 
the worst of the authoritarian 
world. This cultural subversion 
helped us win hearts and 
minds. 
Another 
organization 
with a much less welcoming 
mascot also did a lot to export 
American culture and try and 
turn the hearts of citizens 
of 
authoritarian 
countries. 
During the Cold War, the CIA 
exported American cultural 
icons and Western art abroad 
to fight communism. The CIA 
was instrumental in launching 
the 
Congress 
for 
Cultural 
Freedom, one of the most 
influential 
advocacy 
groups 
supporting the West during 
the Cold War. They supported 
a number of artists, writers 
and more abroad until finally 
dissolving in 1979 (the CIA’s 
relationship ended with them 
in 1966). However, this was 
not the only time Western 
intelligence 
fought 
cultural 
wars — artists like Dizzy 
Gillespie and Louis Armstrong 
went abroad on goodwill tours 
to help the CIA. The tours were 
successful, and this type of 
cultural influence should get a 
second look from policymakers 

today because it helped both 
America and the countries 
targeted by the visits. Those 
on 
the 
policy’s 
receiving 
end got to see the value of 
pluralistic 
democracy 
and 
the beautiful cultural content 
it 
created, 
and 
America 
benefitted and gave itself a 
better name. We projected 
ourselves as a beacon of 
hope and liberty, leading us 
to believe we had a duty of 
higher causes.
The 
CIA’s 
propaganda 
efforts wound down after 
the fall of the USSR perhaps 
because capitalism itself was 
meant to fill in for cultural 
export 
efforts. 
However, 
this fill-in has not occurred. 
Capitalism has done much 
to raise the global standard 
of living and deserves more 
than two cheers, but every 
economic 
system 
has 
its 
limits. At a certain point, there 
has to be external pressure on 
countries to address human 
rights issues — and while it 
would be nice if it came from 
a united front of Western 
companies and governments 
standing up for basic decency 
(and 
clearly 
saying 
that 
concentration camps are bad), 
it clearly will not. 
The CIA should step up to 
the plate once again. Though 
it has had failures like any 
other 
intelligence 
agency, 
its value-based efforts in the 
past did a lot of good and are 
needed again in today’s world. 
Finally, it is worth thinking 
about how amazing the stories 
that will come out via the 
Freedom of Information Act 
process in 30 years will be if 
the CIA restarts the process. 
The last time the FOIA process 
happened, it was found that 
the CIA funded activist Gloria 
Steinem. This entire enterprise 
can be easily justified by the 
laughs we’ll have when it 
comes out that CIA Director 
Gina Haspel chose to fund 
Lena Dunham because the 
latter’s writing is more painful 
than waterboarding.

Unwrapping the conversation about wrapping it up
M

y high school sex-
ed 
experience 
wasn’t 
great 
— 
probably not a controversial 
statement. But living in a 
country where only 18 states 
require information about 
birth control to be part of 
the curriculum, I consider 
myself lucky to have received 
at least some information 
on how to practice safe sex, 
even if it was delivered by 
a guy who taught kickball 
next period. The education 
included 
the 
delightfully 
cliché 
pin-the-condom-on-
the-banana demonstration in 
front of a group of squirming 
high 
school 
sophomores 
unsuccessfully 
attempting 
to stifle their giggles. This 
performance was nearly the 
sum total of the condom 
discussion: Don’t have sex, 
but in case you do, use a 
condom and use it correctly. 
Aside from the abstinence 
encouragement, 
I 
was 
satisfied with the knowledge 
provided. Condoms are a 
necessity for safe sex — use 
one every time. How much 
more complicated can it be?
A lot more complicated, 
as it turns out. As I took 
my 
education 
outside 
of 
the classroom, I discovered 
wrapping it up wasn’t as 
simple as I had believed it 
would be. I’ve experienced 
and heard countless stories 
of something Cosmopolitan’s 
Julia 
Pugachevsky 
calls 
“rubber-stalling”: hesitation, 
avoidance and even surprise 
surrounding 
the 
question 
of 
grabbing 
a 
condom. 
Eventually, this resistance 
became somewhat expected, 
despite how uncomfortable 
and insecure the behavior 
made me feel. I accepted this 
aversion to condoms as a part 
of my society’s particular 
sexual script. But looking 
back on my experiences and 
others’ stories in the wake 
of the #MeToo movement, 
I 
recognize 
how 
serious 
and 
unacceptable 
these 
behaviors are. In many cases, 
resistance to a partner’s safe 
sex requirements is a form of 
reproductive coercion — and 
reproductive coercion is a 
form of abuse. Furthermore, 
condoms are imperative to 
sexual health on a private 
and public level as they 
are the only form of birth 
control to offer protection 
against sexually transmitted 
infections. It is crucial to 
acknowledge the necessity 
of 
condom 
use 
and 
the 
implications of resistance to 
it, and to empower everyone 
to speak out against all forms 
of reproductive coercion in 
order to mitigate its effects 
and to prevent it in the first 
place.
While 
encouraging 
safe sex is important for 
everyone, it is especially 
pertinent to college students 
— after all, nearly half of 
newly diagnosed STIs per 

year 
occur 
among 
young 
people aged 15 to 24. Yet 
over 15 percent of college 
students report never using 
a condom, with another 14 
percent 
only 
using 
them 
sometimes. This isn’t just 
a 
matter 
of 
monogamy, 
either: Those who reported 
always using condoms had 
the second-lowest average 
of sexual partners, while 
those in the ‘never’ category 
averaged 
the 
most. 
Of 
course, 
there 
is 
nothing 
wrong with having many 
sexual partners, but non-
monogamy and unprotected 
sex do not make a cute 
couple. So why is it they are 
paired so often? For one, 
there 
are 
misconceptions 
and 
excuses 
surrounding 
condoms, 
including 
that 
they’re all the same, they 
ruin the mood and — my 
personal favorite — condoms 
are simply too small. The 
overall 
attitude 
seems 
to be they just don’t feel 

good. And while there is no 
denying condoms do remove 
some 
sensation, 
many 
of 
the protective measures we 
take to maintain a healthy 
lifestyle 
have 
undesirable 
side effects — case in point, 
hormonal birth control. Yet 
taking the pill does not face 
nearly as much opposition as 
using a condom does. In fact, 
it’s often used as a reason not 
to wear a condom. But having 
another form of pregnancy 
prevention in place is not 
a 
sufficient 
justification 
for 
going 
unprotected. 
Condoms are a necessary 
measure 
to 
prevent 
STIs 
that range from unpleasant 
to life-threatening. When it 
comes to promoting public 
sexual health and individual 
wellness, condom use is a 
no-brainer.
Of course, practicing safe 
sex is not just about using 
protection. Although it is 
rarely discussed in even the 
best American high school 
sex-ed courses, mental and 
emotional factors play a huge 
role in healthy, enjoyable 
sex. Defining and upholding 
a culture of consent is crucial 
to sexual health on college 
campuses. This is especially 
true at the University of 
Michigan, where a striking 
34.3 percent of women in 
the undergraduate student 
body 
have 
reported 
non-
consensual 
contact 
since 
enrollment. 
The 
physical 

and emotional aspects of 
sex are not separate, and 
condoms and consent often 
go hand-in-hand. According 
to the Sexual Assault and 
Prevention 
Awareness 
Center, 
U-M’s 
definition 
of consent includes that 
consent 
is 
unambiguous, 
mutually understood and 
freely given. This definition 
certainly 
applies 
to 
the 
decision to use a condom, 
and begging, pleading or 
guilt-tripping someone into 
sex without a condom is 
absolutely not consensual. 
These behaviors are not 
exclusive to men, either. 
In a 2017 survey by The 
Journal of Sex Research, 
roughly half of the women 
surveyed reported taking 
action to avoid condoms, 
including 
seduction 
tactics and manipulation. 
Everyone needs to be held 
accountable in practicing 
consensual sex, including 
when it comes to grabbing 
a condom — and everyone 
needs to be empowered to 
control their sexual health.
There 
are 
individuals 
who may genuinely struggle 
with 
condoms, 
which 
is 
completely valid. It is not 
valid, 
however, 
to 
use 
that struggle as an excuse 
to 
coerce 
someone 
into 
unprotected sex. There are 
many healthy, productive 
strategies 
for 
improving 
condom 
experience, 
such 
as 
trying 
out 
different 
kinds. Condoms are not 
one-size-fits-all 
and 
it 
may require some trial and 
error to find the perfect 
match. Another approach is 
taking the condom outside 
of an intimate setting by 
masturbating 
with 
one, 
which 
can 
help 
break 
potential 
psychological 
associations 
between 
condoms 
and 
negative 
sexual 
experiences. 
And 
if external condoms really 
aren’t working out, do not 
fret. 
Internal 
condoms, 
sometimes 
called 
female 
condoms, 
provide 
similar 
STI protection. With that 
in 
mind, 
there 
certainly 
are 
circumstances 
where 
it’s 
OK 
to 
stop 
using 
condoms, 
but 
such 
a 
decision should be reached 
through conversation and 
consideration, not coercion. 
A safe, consensual sex life 
is a human right, and the 
experience of resistance or 
refusal to safe sex behaviors 
should not be normalized. 
By acknowledging rubber-
stalling for what it is — 
coercion and abuse — we 
can 
empower 
individuals 
to 
speak 
about 
their 
experiences 
and 
prevent 
it from happening in the 
first place. Let’s wrap this 
up: wrap it up. It’s not that 
complicated.

Stifling defense leads Michigan 
past MSU, 2-0, to claim Big Bear

With about three minutes 
left 
to 
play, 
freshman 
goalkeeper 
Owen 
Finnerty 
dove out from 
his 
near 
post 
to 
cut 
off 
a 
low cross into 
the 
box. 
The 
crowd 
roared. 
The 
radio 
announcer’s 
voice 
grew 
excited 
as 
he 
finally 
got 
to 
commend the keeper on his 
first collegiate save.
In fact, Finnerty’s effort was 
not a save at all. 
The announcer’s misplaced 
excitement indicated the flow 
of Michigan men’s soccer’s 2-0 
win against Michigan State on 
Tuesday night, as the freshman 
had zero save opportunities in 
his collegiate debut.
Finnerty 
certainly 
performed 
well, 
as 
he 
demonstrated 
good 
kicking 
ability and a keen awareness, 
but he couldn’t have asked for 
better support from his back 
line. 
The defensive quartet of 
senior 
Abdou 
Samake 
and 
juniors Joel Harrison, Austin 
Swiech and Jackson Ragen 
played a stellar match, flowing 
as one cohesive unit en route to 
the Wolverines’ eighth clean 
sheet in 16 matches.
Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 
Daley was quick to praise his 
defense, pointing out that the 
team has only given up 12 goals 
through 16 matches, and that 
two of those goals were off 
penalty kicks and four came in 
the first match.
The 
defense 
matched 
the standard it has set for 
itself throughout the game. 
Michigan 
State 
barely 

mustered any offense in the 
whole 
match, 
repeatedly 
watching as any danger they 
created was cleared the second 
it materialized.
Such 
solid 
defensive play 
sowed benefits 
for the offense 
as well. While 
the Wolverines 
sputtered 
offensively 
at 
points 
throughout 
the match, the 
strikeforce 
benefitted 
from the freedom its defense 
permitted. Michigan enjoyed a 
substantial lead in possession 
because the defense forced 
turnovers so quickly.
“They’re rocks back there,” 
said graduate transfer Nebosja 
Popovich. 
“It 
puts 
other 
teams under pressure (when 
the defense plays very well). 
Because we’re so solid in the 
back we end up having more 
chances in games.”
Popovich 
and 
senior 
forward Jack Hallahan were 
the primary beneficiaries of 
the defense’s play. Each played 
an important role in applying 
the offensive pressure that 
resulted in Michigan hoisting 
the Big Bear Trophy after the 
final whistle blew.
Popovich took advantage of 
the few scoring chances that 
came the Wolverines’ way, 
netting the only two goals in 
the game: a goal off a chaotic 
corner in the ninth minute and 
a low, curling shot from outside 
the box 28 minutes later. 
And although Hallahan was 
ultimately left without a goal 
or assist, the senior forward 
repeatedly charged at Michigan 
State’s wingbacks, creating a 
large portion of Michigan’s 
encouraging possessions with 
quick dribbling moves and 

timely crosses and leaving his 
footprints all over Tuesday’s 
match.
In 
what 
Daley 
praised 
as 
a 
“gritty 
and 
grindy” 
performance 
in 
a 
physical 
slugfest of a game, it is only 
fitting that the two offensive 
standouts 
immediately 
credited the defense for their 
success. 
“We feel safe with them 
back there,” Hallahan said. 
“We know they can keep clean 
sheets, which is a nice feeling.”
Daley said that he told the 
offense at half that two goals 
was not enough, but even one 
gets the win when your the 
goalkeeper doesn’t face a shot.

Wolverines triumph in rivalry bout

After a sluggish game, it was the 
Michigan men’s soccer team that 
awoke from hibernation to win 
the Big Bear Trophy against rival 
Michigan State, for the first time 
since 2015. 
A physical matchup ended up 
with the Wolverines (8-4-4 overall, 
3-1-3 Big Ten) defeating Michigan 
State (3-10-3, 3-3-1), 2-0. The win 
allowed Michigan to jump three 
spots in the Big Ten standings, 
leaping over the Spartans to third 
in the conference.
“That’s a good, positive win 
for a group,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “More importantly 
for us, to get three points in the 
league and not get distracted by 
the magnitude of the moment. And 

I think our guys did a great job at 
settling in and grinding it out.”
Daley was right to characterize 
it a grind-it-out type of game. 
Just 10 minutes into the game, 
Michigan 
State 
defender 
Nick 
Woodruff 
illegally slid into 
Michigan junior 
midfielder Marc 
Ybarra, knocking 
him to the ground 
and 
earning 
a 
yellow 
card. 
The 
Wolverines 
and 
Spartans 
acquired 
three 
more yellow cards and totaled 25 
fouls by the end of the game.
Michigan 
senior 
forward 
Jack Hallahan could attest to 
the physicality of the game. He 

battled all game on the right 
side of the field with Spartan 
defenders. 
In the 35th minute, Hallahan 
caught up to a leading through 
ball and dribbled 
it up toward the 
corner. Michigan 
State midfielder 
Alex Shterenberg 
contested 
Hallahan 
the 
whole 
way, 
pushing 
and 
shoving 
him. 
Hallahan 
managed 
to 
create space and 
get a good cross off. 
“It’s a rivalry game,” Hallahan 
said with a chuckle. “And I kind 
of like it, honestly. If people are 
fouling you, it probably means 
you are doing something right.”
Hallahan 
created 
efficient 
plays that set up his teammates, 
which compensated for his lack 
of scoring. And despite fighting 
through an undisclosed injury, 
he looked like he was near full 
strength.
“Yeah, he was good in the first 
45 minutes,” Daley said. “Over 
the last 25 minutes, I think you 
saw what he’s all about.”
Two 
first-half 
goals 
by 
Michigan 
fifth-year 
senior 
Nebojsa Popovic helped ease 
some of the pressure in this 
sluggish 
fight 
of 
a 
game. 
However, 
the 
contact 
and 
intensity continued throughout 
the game. 
“We stayed positive and keep 
fighting to the end,” Daley said. 
In the 48th minute, Michigan 
junior 
forward 
Mohammed 
Zakyi ran directly into Michigan 
State goalkeeper Hunter Morse. 
A through ball zoomed past 
Zakyi, and he was unable to stop 
his momentum, barrelling into 
Morse. Zakyi knocked Morse 
over with ease, got up and ran 
away without looking back. 
It was the kind of moment — 
hardly pretty, but overpowering 
nonetheless — that encapsulated 
Michigan’s win.

In aftermath of loss to Western Michigan, ‘M’ focuses on intangibles

After losing the first road 
game of the season against 
then-No. 18 Western Michigan, 
the Michigan hockey team was 
quiet on the ride back from 
Kalamazoo on Saturday night.
“When do you let it go?” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“When do you get over it? When 
do you just say ‘OK, you know 
what, we can’t bring it back, 
we’re over and done with it?’”
Pearson believes the somber 
mood was the result of multiple 
factors — namely, the loss and 
overall fatigue from playing 
extremely physical games two 
nights in a row with travel in 
between.
“It’s not like you lost and 
you’re throwing a party or 
anything right after,” Pearson 
said. “They were subdued about 
it. They’re taking it serious, but 
at the same time they know that 
we have a good team.”
He also thinks highly of 
this group and is quick to pick 
out its strengths and areas for 
improvement. The team effort 
on the defensive end — as well 
as solid goaltending — stand out 
to him most, as these factors 
can give a team the chance 
to win any game. But on the 
other hand, the offense needs a 
spark to start capitalizing on its 
opportunities.
Pearson’s 
observations 
extend 
off 
the 
ice, 
too. 

Specifically, he’s taken note 
of 
leadership, 
chemistry, 
preparation 
and 
confidence. 
Chemistry is important to any 
team, as it can lead to a more 
competitive, 
cohesive 
effort 
on the big stage. Pearson likes 
where 
the 
chemistry is at 
right now but 
sees room for 
growth.
“The 
chemistry 
part of it takes 
time,” 
Pearson 
said. “You just 
can’t put it all 
together.”
Much 
of 
the 
responsibility 
to 
build 
chemistry goes to the veterans, 
and so far, Pearson is delighted 
with the leadership he’s seen. 
He 
recognizes 
the 
unique 
personalities 
among 
the 
Wolverines and knows different 
players prefer being treated 
and reached out to in different 
ways.
He views his leaders’ ability 
to navigate this and effectively 
manage the rest of the players 
as a major asset. The veterans 
know how to balance being 
strict on players with letting 
them cut back.
What impresses him the 
most, though, is the leaders’ 
effort to create a positive 
environment for all.
“They’re really good at that,” 
Pearson said. “As far as just 

being welcoming to all our 
freshmen and then making 
sure they know that they’re a 
big part of this team, that we 
don’t have cliques and things 
like that, because it’s easy to 
get in those groups. I mean, 
the two Swedish 
guys 
can 
just 
sit in the corner 
and talk Swedish 
all the time if 
they 
wanted, 
but we have to 
pull 
everybody 
together, 
and 
that’s one of my 
biggest 
things, 
is to make sure 
that we’re in it 
together and we lose together, 
we win together. 
“... It’s just how they’re able 
to draw everybody and make 
everybody feel welcome, and 
that’s so important. Even some 
returning guys who maybe 
don’t have big roles or whatnot, 
we try to stress the importance 
of everybody on the team. 
There’s a reason everybody is 
here.”
But while the chemistry is 
coming along, Pearson would 
like to see better preparation — 
specifically, mental preparation 
in the moments before a game.
Pearson was displeased with 
the group’s preparation leading 
into Saturday’s loss. He notes 
that it’s clear ahead of time 
when a team is casual instead 
of mentally focused. Freshman 
forward Eric Ciccolini offered a 
similar sentiment.
“Just coming off a win Friday 
night I think that you got to be 
more prepared, obviously, and 
not take (the opponent) too 
lightly,” Ciccolini said. “We 
beat them 4-0 and then they 
came back at us hard, which we 
knew they were gonna, but we 
didn’t react good enough to.”
To Pearson, a central part of 
preparation is about balance. 
He doesn’t want his players to 
be too tight or scared to play, 
but at the same time needs 
them to be in the zone and 
ready to go right away. Finding 
that balance, or “sweet spot,” as 

he calls it, can instill valuable 
confidence 
when 
the 
puck 
drops.
“You can have all these things 
and then you got to sprinkle in 
some confidence, but you can’t 
go to the corner store,” Pearson 

said. “I can go to the corner 
store and buy some eggs, and 
some flour and whatever water 
I gotta to start making the cake 
and icing, but I can’t go and 
sprinkle in confidence. You 
can’t. You have to go out and 

earn that and acquire that and 
develop that.”
If Michigan can continue 
its strides with the intangibles 
then Pearson might get what 
he’s looking for when the oven 
sounds.

‘Cees in Space’: Ruiz hitting stride

Cesar Ruiz sat atop the 
podium, 
smirking 
frequently 
and bantering with junior guard 
Michael Onwenu to his right. 
The confidence oozed — perhaps 
due to the 57-carry, 303-yard 
demolition his unit had just 
orchestrated, perhaps simply a 
product of his happy-go-lucky 
attitude.
“We said in the locker room 
we knew what kind of game 
it was going to be,” Ruiz said 
after the game. “We changed 
the openers a little bit. We knew 
we were gonna be ground and 
pounding a lot today. It’s the 
game we’ve been waiting for. We 
love running the ball. And just, 
we knew today was gonna be 
the day we were gonna be able to 
showcase it.”
It wasn’t simply that Ruiz 
and the rest of the offensive 
line had its way with a physical 
Notre Dame defense, but the 
manner in which it happened. In 
a persistent rain, the Irish knew 
Michigan was going to run. 
The Wolverines did so anyway, 
putting hat on hat, winning 
individual matchups, completely 
taking over the game en rout to a 
45-14 win.
When 
Ruiz 
arrived 
at 
Michigan, the offensive line 
was 
among 
this 
program’s 
biggest flaws; his commitment 
was a major boon. Now, that 
group appears to be the team’s 
foundation, and the Notre Dame 
game was just the latest evidence 
of the group’s evolution. The 
coaches said Ruiz graded out the 
highest among a group of highly-
graded linemen on Saturday. 
“I thought he had his best 
game as a Michigan Wolverine,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh on his radio show 
Monday night. “He was doing 
so many athletic things in this 
ball game. He had a touchdown 
block. And on that one, where he 
did pull and got the block on the 

linebacker, you actually see him 
checking the gap before he went 
on his pull.”
Ruiz 
has 
started 
from 
day one, arriving with the 
Wolverines after a year at IMG 
Academy in Florida. He was 
a top-tier recruit, as close to a 
finished product as they come. 
He appeared in 10 games in 
2017, his freshman season, and 
started at guard in the final five 
— both merited by pure talented 
and warranted by necessity.
Still, there are times in every 
successful 
collegiate 
career 
when things really click — when 
the speed and complication 
ceases, and football becomes 
football again. Ruiz always 
had too much talent to fail, 
but there have been times of 
inconsistency in the first couple 
years of his career.
Any such struggles appear to 
be ways of the past now.
“I have two starting centers 
in 
the 
National 
Football 
League, both started as rookies. 
He has that kind of ability some 
day to get to that point,” said 
Michigan offensive line coach 
Ed Warriner in April 2018, the 
spring preceding Ruiz’s second 
season. “Not yet, he’s just a 
young kid. But if he keeps going, 
I know what they look like.”
That was, presumably, mere 
months after the two had met. 
All Warriner had to do was 
flash Ruiz’s high school tape to 

know he’d be relying on Ruiz 
early and often. All Ruiz had 
to do was toss a cursory Google 
search of Warriner’s history to 
understand why that need went 
both ways.
The comfort level with Ruiz 
is now obvious, and all parties 
are reaping the benefits.
“He’s good in space — we 
tease him, ‘Cees in space,’ We 
joke around about that. We 
got into a situation with the 
defenses where we were playing 
where we were able to pull him 
some, get him on the perimeter, 
and he likes doing that.”
Added Harbaugh: “The level 
of him understanding the game 
has really grown where he can 
know the front, see rotations 
now and even when he goes 
to put his head between his 
legs to snap the ball back to 
Shea,” Harbaugh said. “He’s 
got a pretty good idea where 
his man is going to be even if 
that linebacker moved or that 
down-lineman 
moved. 
It’s 
extraordinary.”
After Saturday’s game, Ruiz 
and Onwenu were asked a 
question about whether this 
kind of performance had been 
building. Onwenu went first, 
providing a diplomatic answer.
Ruiz nodded immediately, 
smiled and nudged toward his 
microphone. 
“I knew it was coming sooner 
or later.”

Defense mixing in more zone looks

Five 
months 
after 
The 
Game happened, Don Brown 
was still getting asked about 
it. His vaunted defense, one 
that dominated 10 straight 
teams and seemed like a train 
rolling into Columbus last year, 
couldn’t stand up to Ohio State.
The 
Buckeyes 
whipped 
Michigan, scoring 62 points on 
the back of crossing route after 
crossing route, with the basic 
man-coverage 
beaters 
doing 
their jobs. And when spring ball 
came around last April, Brown 
was still answering for it.
It was clear at the time 
that Brown, the Wolverines’ 
defensive coordinator, wasn’t 
about to back away from his 
philosophies. Not now, not at 
age 64, not when he’s piloted 
one of the best defenses in the 
country since first stepping 
into Schembechler Hall in 2016. 
But that didn’t mean he wasn’t 
going to address the issue at 
hand.
That 
brings 
us 
to 
last 
Saturday, as Notre Dame dialed 
up play after play designed to 
beat man coverage. When he 
saw zone, quarterback Ian Book 
reeled.
“We have been playing a lot 
more zone,” said cornerbacks 
coach 
Mike 
Zordich 
on 
Wednesday. “I think it’s helped 
in a lot of aspects, especially in 
the passing game, cause they’re 
not expecting it.”
Michigan doesn’t need to 
be a zone team to be effective 
running zone. Football is a 
chess match — if you can throw 
something different at your 
opponent than what they’re 
expecting, 
you’re 
probably 
going to come out on top.
That was what happened 
Saturday, as Book stared into 
the zone coverages like a test 
he hadn’t studied for. It didn’t 
help that there was a monsoon 
during the first half, or that 

Brian Kelly’s playcalling didn’t 
seem to account for the weather. 
But Book finished 8-for-25 
with just 73 passing yards. “I 
definitely think he was a little 
confused,” said junior safety 
Brad Hawkins on Monday.
Brown’s base zone coverage 
is called “Eagle.” It’s not new 
— he’s had it in his playbook 
for a long time — but he’s now 
deploying it more liberally.
As far as self-scouting goes, 
any evaluation of Michigan 
under Brown would have shown 
a team married to single-high 
coverage with a tendency to 
blitz liberally. That, to be clear, 
is not a bad thing. Anything 
that gets you to the sustained 
success Brown has had is the 
opposite.
But a lack of ability to do much 
else well put the Wolverines on 
the back foot in Columbus last 
year. And ultimately, beating 
teams of that caliber is still the 
hump Michigan still needs to 
get over.
Against 
Notre 
Dame, 
a 
rival and a top-10 team, the 
Wolverines managed to shut 
things down with a healthy 
mix. They still know who they 
are, and they certainly aren’t 
about to stray from Brown’s 
aggressive philosophy. “Within 
all that zone coverage, there’s 
still pressure,” Zordich said. 

“So that is a big plus for us.”
Still, 
adapting 
to 
each 
opponent has been an emphasis.
“Every week, Don does add 
a little different flavoring into 
it,” Zordich said. “Little change 
in the pattern, here or there. 
You have to make changes 
weekly, but the core of it pretty 
much stays the same, and that’s 
how you get better.”
As Michigan tries to bridge 
the gap that has defined the 
program, going from a team 
that makes its living against 
lackluster 
competition 
to 
one that can beat anyone, 
adjustments like that are a 
necessity.
Ohio State exposed that hole 
last year, and Brown seemed 
to slam it shut against Notre 
Dame.
“It 
definitely 
has 
teams 
guessing,” Hawkins said. “Has 
quarterbacks guessing.”
It 
doesn’t 
solve 
every 
problem for the defense, and 
the Fighting Irish should not be 
mistaken for the Buckeyes. But 
it is clear that while everyone 
was still dwelling on Michigan’s 
problems last spring, Brown 
was working on a solution.
“Don Brown called a great 
game,” said Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh on Saturday. “He 
really had it wired. Can’t say 
enough about that.”

Wednesday night’s exhibition 
against Division II Northwood 
offered an opportunity for the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team to showcase its talent 
working at peak level. 
Leaning on their superior size 
and tough defense, the Wolverines 
ran 
with 
that 
opportunity, 
dominating the Timberwolves, 
97-46. 
Michigan opened the night 
on a 12-0 run and finished the 
first quarter up 30-11, behind 
senior forward Kayla Robbins’ 
eight points on 3-for-3 shooting. 
Keeping up the pressure, it put 
Northwood into foul trouble early, 
drawing four fouls in the first three 
minutes of the game. This forced 
the Timberwolves into a more 
tentative approach defensively, 
opening up space down low. 
As a result, the Wolverines’ 
bigs feasted, spearheading the 
team’salmost unfathomable 58 
points in the paint. 
“I think (scoring in the paint) is 
something that our team has got to 
do this year,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “Because our 
post game is our strength, and our 
ability to score in the paint.”
Senior guard Akienreh Johnson 
aided the Wolverines’ dominant 
offensive attack early on, adding 
seven first-quarter points of her 
own, including a 3-pointer that 
helped Michigan balloon its lead 
at the end of the first quarter. 
In 
the 
second 
quarter, 
sophomore forward Naz Hillmon 
and freshman forward Izabel 
Varejão stepped up. Hillmon 
tallied seven points on 3-for-3 
shooting before she was subbed 
out midway through the quarter. 
She and Varejão, who notched 10 
points of her own in the second 
quarter, proved to be a lethal one-
two punch on both sides of the 
ball. Their length helped them 
to anchor defense that held the 
Timberwolves to just eight points 
in the second quarter.
“I feel like me and Naz have 
a really good game together,” 

Varejão said. “Because I can shoot, 
and she can post up.”
Varejão was just one example 
in a game full of young players 
seizing the opportunity to shine 
against inferior talent. Sophomore 
forward Emily Kiser — who 
didn’t see much playing time as a 
freshman — tallied 10 points on 
4-of-4 shooting, and freshman 
guard Michelle Sidor notched 
eight points on 2-of-6 shooting. 
Freshman guard Maddie Nolan 
added four points of her own — all 
from the free-throw line. 
“Michelle is a power shooter,” 
Varejão said. “ … She made a few 
threes, she was being patient. 
Maddie hustling — that’s her 
thing, she hustled. So I feel like 
we (freshmen) did what we were 

supposed to do.”
The Wolverines maintained 
their 55-19 halftime lead with elite 
defense, holding Northwood to a 
dismal 25 percent shooting in the 
third quarter and 34.5 percent 
over the whole second half. 
“(We used) our length to get 
steals, 
deflections 
and 
tips,” 
Johnson said. “Even something 
as small as close out, put your 
hands up, really takes away their 
shot and makes their shooting 
percentage go down.” 
Added Barnes Arico: “Our 
communication (on defense) was 
better (than in practice). We 
were way more aggressive from 
the tip. We didn’t sustain it for 40 
minutes, but that’s our next step 
in our development.”

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team began its season 
on Wednesday with an exhibition 
against Northwood. With three of 
its main rotation players from last 
season not returning, it was an 
opportunity for the Wolverines’ 
younger players to earn minutes 
before the regular season.
Michigan’s 
three 
freshmen 
— guard Maddie Nolan, guard 
Michelle Sidor and center Izabel 
Varejão — all took advantage of 
their first in-game opportunity to 
impress the coaching staff.
Varejão was the standout of 
the trio. In 21 minutes, she led 
the team with 18 points, shooting 

8-for-10 from the floor — tacking 
on six rebounds, three blocks 
and two steals. When she was on 
the floor she made her presence 
felt 
the 
paint, 
scoring 16 points 
inside, and her 
teammates 
continued to look 
for her for easy 
baskets.

“It 
feels 
great, honestly,” 
Varejão 
said. 
“Before your first 
game, 
being 
a 
freshman, you’re 
a little nervous. 
… It’s my first time playing college 
basketball, and then I go out there 
and I play well like I did today. 
It just encourages me for next 
game.”
Varejão also showed that she 
can be a threat from 3-point 
range. Towards the end of the 
fourth quarter she attempted a 
three, and while it did not fall, her 
shot appeared comfortable from 
deep. An ability to score in the 
paint and on the perimeter could 
make Varejão a difficult player to 
defend.
“I usually shoot threes but today 
didn’t have many opportunities,” 
Varejão said. “...it’s hard to block 
(6-foot-4) players especially if it’s 
threes, so it just gives me more 
options in the game.”
While 
Varejão 
racked 
up 
statistics, 
Nolan 
impacted 
the game in ways that didn’t 
necessarily show up in the box 
score and earned minutes with 
four of the starters to start the 
fourth quarter. In the second 
quarter, Nolan missed a three, but 
hustled to get her own rebound 
and found sophomore forward 
Naz Hillmon under the basket, 
which resulted in two free throws. 
In the fourth quarter, Nolan dove 
on the floor for a loose ball, a play 
that caught the attention of senior 
guard Akienreh Johnson.
“Maddie came in and got down 
on the ball,” Johnson said. “I don’t 
know if you guys have seen her, 
but she’s got that knee brace, but 
she’s still on the ground, she does 

not care.”
Of the three freshmen, she was 
not as highly-touted of a recruit as 
Varejão and Sidor, but Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes Arico saw 
a lot positives in 
her game.
“I think any 
time 
you 
can 
have 
a 
player 
that understands 
their 
role 
and 
buys into what 
you need them 
to do to help 
the 
team 
be 
successful, they 
are an unbelievable addition to the 
team,” Barnes Arico said. “She’s 
just gradually getting better and 
better each and every single day, 
and I’m gaining confidence in 
her ability to really help us be 
successful.”
Sidor 
showed 
how 
her 
quickness could be a game-
changer 
for 
the 
Wolverines. 
Throughout the second quarter, 
Sidor had the opportunity to run 
the point and consistently pushed 
the pace. She scored six points in 
her six minutes in that quarter 
alone, along with an assist and a 
steal.
“I think we really want her 
to push the pace, but that kid 
is a scorer,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She’s a bucket-getter and I 
think she really needs to have 
that mentality on the floor for us 
because she does shoot the three 
exceptionally well and she can 
score around the rim. So I want 
her to be aggressive, and I was 
happy with her ability to do that 
tonight.”
Not 
only 
did 
the 
trio’s 
performance impress coaches, 
but it also gave Michigan’s 
experienced players confidence 
that 
the 
freshmen 
can 
be 
important 
contributors 
this 
season.
“I was so excited,” Johnson 
said. “Iz was able to make some 
great moves. Michelle has been 
getting rebounds … I think they 
just played really great, and I was 
really very happy for them.”

2B — Thursday, October 31, 2019
b-side
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

There’s nothing quite like Halloween on a college campus. In 
most people’s minds, Halloween is one day, Oct. 31, where all 
the ghouls and black cats come out to play. But in a college town, 
the spirit of the season goes on for weeks, if not all year round. 
There’s a reason we all refer to the general timeline between 
Oct. 15 and Nov. 5 as “Halloweek.” This is especially true of 
the costume culture in Ann Arbor, which serves as a healthy 
reminder of both the brilliance and the stupidity of everyone in 
their early twenties. You might see the best costume to ever walk 
this earth, but you will also inevitably witness a parade of sexy 
black cats marching to various frat parties. Who’s to say which 
is empirically better — the point is, Ann Arbor is no stranger to 
dressing up. 
In the past three years that I’ve lived in our magical city, 
Halloween has always been an event to anticipate eagerly. I’ll be 
honest: It is my favorite holiday and always has been, so it wouldn’t 
take much to get me excited about that special day anyway. But 
there’s something even more whimsical and fun about the energy 
of an entire city dressing up for weeks on end, the joy on the faces 
of everyone who lives here, from students to children to those 
who hand out candy and host parties. Regardless of what you’re 
disguised as this year, the brilliance of Halloween in Ann Arbor 
is worth noting, even if it’s just listening to the laughter on our 
streets or catching a stray glimpse of a cape as someone walks 
past. 
This seasonal spirit is most present at special events on 
campus, such as the annual showing of cult film “The Rocky 
Horror Picture Show” at the Michigan Theater.
“‘Rocky Horror’ has just been something that we’ve been doing 
in our theater forever,” said Ariel Wan, Director of Programs and 
Marketing for the State Theater in an interview with The Daily 
last week. The showing of “Rocky Horror” is something myself 
and my friends look forward to annually, notwithstanding the 
excuse to go out in basically nothing and scream at a screen for 
two hours. It isn’t truly Halloween in Ann Arbor, or even 
fall for that matter, without seeing that line of leather-clad 
students and film geeks alike wrap all the way around the 
block. 
“They always did it at the State Theater,” Wan continued, 
“you know, the State Theater used to be really divey and 
kind of gross, like perfect for people to throw stuff, you 
know?” (For anyone who has, in fact, attended a showing 
of the film around Halloween, they would know that this is 
an absolutely perfect setting for a very dirty time, in more 
ways than one.) “When they closed the State Theater for 
renovations, we were like, well, we still need to do ‘Rocky 
Horror,’ but we can’t do it at the State, let’s just put it up 
the Michigan . . . And it sold out. 1700 seats.” The sheer 
scale of the main theater she was referring to is a sight to 
behold, especially compared to the pre-renovation State’s 
mere 400 seats. “You can’t hear the movie at all,” Wan said, 
laughing. “But it doesn’t matter, because someone next to 
you is screaming all the lines.”
The energy around “Rocky Horror” is a perfect example 
of what can happen when you put one crazy event and an 
entire city of equally crazy people together for one night 
of the year.
“A lot of people are dressed up as the characters. So 
there’s just a lot of thongs and fishnet stockings,” Wan 
said. “We again sold out this year, and we encountered a 
few problems where there were some people not wearing 
shoes and shirts, and we were like, you have to at least 
wear shoes.” We both laughed as she explained the camera 
footage that State Theater’s employees watched that night, 
but I couldn’t help but imagine some of the things I have 
seen myself. This no-shoes, no-shirt, no-nothing concept 
really checks out. There’s nothing like seeing someone 
stand in line for hours in nothing but a bustier and face 
paint. 
Wan said much of the enthusiasm around cult film 
showings like that of “Rocky Horror” is due to the student 
population on campus, notably in terms of the turnout for 
each event.
“Yeah, I mean, the reason why we’re able to sell out 1700 seats 
and still turn away like tens and tens of people is because of the 
students,” Wan explained. “‘Rocky Horror’ is one of those films 
that we don’t spend much, if any marketing dollars on promoting, 
it’s usually just social media and flyering . . . I was looking at the 
number of student tickets versus adult versus our member tickets. 
And students by far were, like, almost 1100 tickets or something 
like that. So we know they’re all still there.” It’s easy to see why 
events like these are so alluring to the students of Ann Arbor 
specifically. I mean, hey, during midterm season, who doesn’t 
enjoy yelling at things with 1700 other people, clad in sequins and 
stars and fake blood all night?
Though “Rocky Horror” is probably the best example of 
costume culture as it pertains to film events in the city, the movie 
isn’t alone in its thousand-person draw to the theater. In addition 
to annual events like a showing of the famously bad movie “The 
Room” starring Tommy Wiseau, the theater also makes sure to 
put on seasonal series that appeal to a larger audience. This month 
specifically saw audiences clamoring to both the Michigan and 
State Theaters to see movies like “Night of the Living Dead” and 
a special late-night feature of “The Blair Witch Project” in light 

of Halloween. Each movie 
is chosen from a different 
decade for every weekend in 
October: “They’re all really 
just 
really 
great 
horror 
movies,” Wan said, “some of 
it is funny, but it’s because 
it’s older. ‘Blair Witch’ still 
scares the shit out of me,” 
she laughed. I couldn’t agree 
with her more.
According 
to 
Wan, 
events like this are what 
keep theaters alive in an 
age of home entertainment 
and 
streaming 
services. 
“People still go to the movie 
theater for the experience 
of watching a movie with 
other people,” Wan said. “No 
screen is bigger than the 
screens here.” 
The 
Michigan 
Theater 
is decidedly the place to go 
to celebrate the Halloween 
season in style, but where do 
you even start with a costume, 
or for fun dressing in general? Go no further than The Getup 
Vintage, a purple-painted secret hidden amongst the shopfronts 
of State Street. Sandwiched in between Totoro and Taste of India 
and just a stone’s throw from Urban Outfitters, the vintage store 
is a nugget of color and happiness on the chilly streets of Ann 
Arbor.
“We’re very fortunate with the foot traffic here on State 
Street,” said co-owner of The Getup Vintage Lindsey Leyland in 
an interview with The Daily. “People (will be) eating at Sava’s and 
something will catch their eye. You know, we’re small. That’s why 
we painted the front purple.” In addition to the purple, they also 

decorate for every season — trust me, the Halloween window is 
something everyone needs to see. 
The Getup has a strong history in Ann Arbor, having served 
the town and students in particular for almost 15 years. The store 
was opened in 2005 by couple Kelly and Paul McLeod in the attic 
of their current space, then sold to Leyland and Mitchell in 2015, 
who expanded downstairs. “It was like a slow and steady climb 
to this place, like, I knew as like a 13-year-old I wanted to have 
a vintage clothing store,” Leyland said. “You know, gotta put in 
your dues and work for a bunch of other people first and a bunch 
of other jobs and figure out what the best fit is. And I love Ann 
Arbor, all of my best friends live here. So it was like an easy place 
to want to settle in. Michigan is one of the most beautiful places 
I’ve ever been.” 
The Getup has always been a favorite of fashionistas in the city 
and also lends itself to costume in whatever form they may desire. 
For Leyland, this line between the costume and the every-day is 
thin, all depending on the day. “To me, costumes start with just 
kind of the quality of the clothing,” she explained. “Like, for me, 
costuming is made to look like the real thing, but not as good. You 
know, unless it’s like an actual theater performance where they’re 
like constructing the things, but like, we have a little costuming 

section over there . . . I guess it just depends on your personality.”
Leyland sat across the front desk from me, clad in an olive-
green military jumpsuit and long ’70s-style hair. “So it really 
just depends on like the personality of the shopper and how 
adventurous they kind of are, with their wardrobe. Like this is 
a neutral color. But some people don’t feel comfortable in, like, 
jumpsuits,” she gestured to her own getup, laughing. Leyland is 
almost a personification of her and co-owner Kaylan Mitchell’s 
technicolor store, a great example of what Ann Arbor brings to 
the realm of adventurous dressing.
Surrounded by the racks and decorations of the store, I couldn’t 
help but notice all the beautiful garments from years past. 
Sure, some of them could be used for a costume, an ’80s 
cruise, ripped apart and remade into modern styles, but 
they are also surprisingly wearable in a contemporary 
wardrobe.
“I always say, you don’t have to replace your whole 
entire modern closet with vintage things. But like, find a 
sweater cut you really like or (like) a little. I feel like the 
’70s clothing fits me best,” Leyland continued. “And then 
try a piece here and there with the stuff you already have. 
Like most of those ’70s dresses, you throw like a modern 
sweater over top of it. I mean, they’re remaking all of those 
styles anyway.” The place of The Getup is not to cater to 
Halloweeners only, who would be better suited to stores 
like Ragstock, which sits farther down Liberty St. The 
Getup is more about fostering a culture of appreciation for 
the clothes we wear and seeing the value in things once 
worn. 
“Some people know what (vintage clothing) is, some 
people still don’t, some people are still confused by a 
secondhand store,” Leyland explained. “That’s why I 
really really try to educate about like, yes this clothing 
has been worn before but I wash it, repair it. Pick only the 
coolest stuff out of Nancy’s basement,” she said. Wearing 
secondhand clothing from The Getup, whether it’s for a 
costume or not, also gives Ann Arbor the chance to see 
itself from the future.
“I think it’s great when people care about (the past of 
their clothing), you know, not everybody cares about the 
history of where you’re from, or where you live and who 
occupied it before you and that’s kind of what we do is, you 
know, meet those people go through their barns, attics, 
basements, closets, and see what type of stuff they have . . . 
I love hearing people talk about, like, why they got this or 
why they got that.” 
Seeing the letterman jackets and vintage Michigan gear 
dotting the walls of the store drives this sentiment home 
as well. It’s a beautiful thing to imagine the original owner 
of a garment screaming in the same Big House stands as you are, 
50 years later. This also goes for any black dress you might buy at 
the store, which according to Leyland, comes with a free witch 
hat during the month of October. “Yeah, like maybe you could 
work this into your costume, but also, like, wear again . . . Really 
you just put a black dress on, a little witch makeup. And then you 
would hopefully wear that black dress again and it wouldn’t be 
like something that sits in your closet forever,” she laughed.
Between The Getup and Ann Arbor’s various theaters, those 
in search of costume need not look far to get their fix, especially 
during this time of year. The climate of a campus filled with the 
excitement of students and the warmth of townies is perfect for 
businesses like Wan’s and Leyland’s to flourish. You don’t have to 
dress up to be a part of the magic, but it always helps.
“It’s a place where they are embraced, you know, that they can 
feel very comfortable, very safe, and they’re among other people 
who are as excited, if not more,” Wan said. Our town is one of 
the only places where not wearing shoes or shirts every day is 
completely permissible. Despite the chill of waiting in line for 
“Rocky Horror” or the brash statement of walking around in a 
shimmering ’70s jumpsuit, the people of Ann Arbor will always 
make you feel warm.

We all have that pair of friends who, almost-
siblings in forbidden love or not, decide to 
dress up as Margot and Richie Tenenbaum 
of Wes Anderson’s “The Royal Tenenbaums” 
for Halloween. She wears a pinstripe Lacoste 
tennis 
dress. 
He 
wears 
a 
shaggy-wig-
headband combo that falls over shoulders in 
a Fila tee. Their costumes are a hit, though 
nobody at the party knows who they’re 
supposed to be. After they spill the beans, 
the party-goer nods and smiles like they’ve 
“maybe seen the end of that one on HBO,” 
and the one guy they’re mutual friends with 
who never stops talking about Wes Anderson 
grins at all the poor uninitiated souls. When 
the 
Richie-and-
Margot-for-a-night 
pair 
get 
home, 
they post a picture 
of their ‘fits on 
Etsy and get added 
to 
a 
government 
database 
somewhere of all 
the people to call if 
our alien invaders’ 
one 
weakness 
is 
the inability to see 
humans dressed as 
quirky 
characters 
from 
early-aughts 
indie movies. 
These 
two 
outfits, along with 
Chas Tenenbaum’s 
iconic red Adidas 
jumpsuit, 
make 
“The 
Royal 
Tenenbaums” 
one of the most 
thematically 
costumed 
films 
in Anderson’s catalogue. Not only do the 
three 
individual 
outfits 
feed 
into 
the 
characterizations of the siblings who wear 
them, the presence of the outfits, and how 
they exist as tokens of the characters’ 
traumas, plays into the film’s atmosphere of a 
childhood disaster that will never end.
Going one by one, the outfits Richie, 
Margot and Chas wear are all tied to the grief 
each of them are trying to beat. Richie wears 
the remnants of his tennis ‘fit, but he hides it 
under a camel-hair coat and trousers. He even 
hides his face, covering it with a beard and 
long hair, searching for a way to free himself 
of the embarrassment of his past — both 
athletically with tennis and romantically 
with the adopted Margot. Chas’s red jumpsuit 
(and the identical jumpsuits he makes his two 
boys Ari and Uzi wear) signal a father on high 
alert. Terrified of the dangers he and his kids 
face at every moment after their plane crashes, 
killing his wife, Chas forces the whole family 
to pack light, to wear clothes that make them 
ready to run or fight at a moment’s notice. 
Though Margot is never seen participating 
in any athletic activities, she too wears a 
sporty ‘fit, usually a Lacoste dress covered by 
a lush fur outercoat. Her outfit’s incongruous 
link to the passion she’s never hinted at can 
be explained by her lost, repressed, forbidden 

love for her stepbrother, resident tennis star, 
Richie. And whew, man, Wes could have done 
better on this last one. Not great, giving your 
one female lead an outfit that characterizes 
her as being all-encompassingly hung up on 
a guy while Richie and Chas’s costumes are 
so individually and vocationally driven. Too 
bad. 
In a film about “getting over it,” everything 
links back to trauma. The house on Archer 
Ave. is as much a character as any of the 
Tenenbaums in the film, and the way it’s 
decorated (the house’s “costume”) plays a 
big part in illustrating how the incidences 
of the Tenenbaum’s childhood has forever 
come back to haunt them. The walls in the 
Tenenbaum house are covered with moments 
of success from the children’s childhood. 
Karate medals and trophies hang next to 
colorful watercolor 
paintings of family 
and 
friends. 
In 
Richie’s 
room, 
joyous 
little 
pictographs 
of 
his father and his 
family fill the space 
between a pulsing 
green 
and 
blue. 
Everything in the 
house is a reminder 
of what should have 
been, of how things 
should have turned 
out, of the successes 
of old that never 
translated 
into 
the future. These 
moments 
exist 
frozen in time in 
the 
Tenenbaum 
house, and as the 
movie 
progresses, 
we see it takes all 
three 
characters 
returning 
(“That 
night, Etheline found all of her children 
living together under the same roof for the 
first time in seventeen years”) to the scene 
of the crime before they’re able to exorcise 
those demons, to be able to finally beat what’s 
been holding them back for their entire adult 
lives.
What I love most about a meticulous 
director like Wes Anderson is that, with 
everything in his movies so hyper-specific 
— every lamp, rug, Sharpie mark on a polka-
dotted rat seemingly chosen by him — there 
are these opportunities for totally tangential 
meaning-making (the whole reading into the 
costumes of the characters and the house 
above) that might not have anything to do 
with what Anderson was thinking when he 
made the choice. I find this misalignment to 
be incredibly exciting. To make an artistic 
decision off of pure instinct and to have 
it still wrap around into some theme or 
characterization you’re not aware you’ve 
been building along the way has to stand 
as a great testament to the artist’s gut. In 
the director’s commentary for “The Royal 
Tenenbaums,” while talking about why 
each of the characters dresses how they do, 
Anderson pauses when he gets to Chas. “The 
red jumpsuit, I’m not sure,” he says, “I guess I 
just thought it was funny.”

Enough with Richie: Let’s
all dress as Chas this year

In theory, performance should be based on 
ability and ability alone. In practice, however, 
there are many other factors at play. For example, 
appearance often has just as large an impact on 
performance as ability does. As the great Deion 
Sanders once said, “Look good, feel good. Feel 
good, play good. Play good, (they) pay good. Pay 
good, live good. Live good, eat good. Die good.” 
He’s right: If you look the part, you’re most 
likely going to perform better, which will lead 
to improvements in all areas of life. That is, in 
everything but metal.
In metal, you have to look the part to play the 
part, but that does not mean you end up rich in 
the end. In fact, it often means that you have 
to work a real job in addition to performing in 
a metal band. But do these acts really care? Of 
course they don’t. They’re in the business of 
metal music to make art, not make millions, and 
the best way for them to make their art is to get 
into costume.
Costumes, whether the artists want to admit it 
or not, are a crucial aspect of metal. Hair metal 
relied on it (you really think these guys dressed 
like this when they weren’t touring?). Black metal 
relied on it (it really sells the image that these 
guys might actually be the dead reincarnate). 
Nu-metal relies on it (if the music is going to 
suck, they have to make it interesting somehow). 
Whatever this kind of metal is relies on it (words 
cannot describe the favors these costumes do 
for the music). Despite this, few bands lean as 
heavily into their costumes as Ghost does.
For Ghost, anonymity is key. The members 
want to release as little personal information 
as possible and focus solely on the music, and to 
do so, they all adorn costumes to maintain their 
namelessness. What’s more, Ghost uses their 
costumes to create their own mythology, a sort of 
storyline surrounding the band and their music. 
Their live shows take themes and rituals from 
the Roman Catholic Church and reinterpret them 
through a Satanic lens. The typical crosses are 
inverted, white is converted to black and rather 
than praise the Holy Trinity, the band worships 
Satan.
Every member of Ghost has their own 
character. The lead singer and guitarist assumes 
the role of Papa Emeritus, a mysterious figure 
shrouded in face paint meant to resemble a skull 
and dressed in Satanic “Papal” garb. The other 
four members — the bassist, guitarist, keyboardist 
and drummer — are part of an ensemble known 
as “A Group of Nameless Ghouls,” a group of 
underlings dressed in dark robes and metallic 
masks subservient to Papa Emeritus. They 
assume no individual identities, distinguished 
on stage by an alchemical symbol — when one of 
them speaks to the media, the quote is attributed 
to “A Nameless Ghoul.” Nothing more, nothing 
less.
The lead singer, on the other hand, is a whole 
lot more interesting. He has undergone several 
transformations as his Papa Emeritus character. 
In fact, there have been four incarnations of 
the character: Papa Emeritus I, Papa Emeritus 
II, Papa Emeritus II’s younger brother Papa 
Emeritus III and the much older Papa Emeritus 
0, each with their own unique and convoluted 
backstory and specific costume. For example, 
Papa Emeritus II was replaced by Papa Emeritus 
III because II was fired for lack of productivity 
in overthrowing churches and governments. 

Though the costumes were meant to conceal 
identities, one of the members was bound to have 
their identity revealed, and ultimately, it was 
Papa Emeritus. 
After being faced by a lawsuit set forth by 
former members of Ghost who claimed they 
lacked adequate compensation for their roles 
in the band, Papa Emeritus decided that it was 
time to oust himself. In 2017, after seven years of 
mystery, Tobias Forge, previously of Repugnant 
and Crashdïet, revealed himself to be the 
mastermind behind Ghost and all iterations of 
the mysterious Papa Emeritus character. Once 
the dust surrounding the lawsuit settled, Forge 
announced a new character: Cardinal Copia. 
Cardinal Copia is a figure once thought to be 
Papa Emeritus IV, yet he shares no relation to 
any manifestation of the Papa Emeritus lineage. 
He sports a plain mask with black eye sockets, 
complete 
heterochromia 
and 
blacked-out 
vestments, and according to Forge, has not yet 
earned his face paint yet. 
In addition to Cardinal Copia, Ghost also added 
several new members. In 2018, a third guitarist 
joined the “Group of Nameless Ghouls,” two new 
keyboardists known only as the “Ghoulettes” 
appeared, and, surprisingly, the artist formerly 
known as Papa Emeritus 0 returned and is 
currently known as the saxophone-wielding 
Papa Nihil. Forge plans for Cardinal Copia to be 
around for only five years, and after that, there’s 
no telling where the band might go next.
The 
elaborate 
costumes, 
innumerable 
characters 
and 
Byzantine 
lore 
may 
seem 
distracting, but they really add a lot of 
dimensionality to Ghost. It makes the music seem 
that much more real. Songs like “Stand by Him” 
and “Rats” are inhuman rockers, and if the songs 
are performed by blatant humans, a lot of the 
band’s charm would be lost. Consider lines like 
this, “Them rats! / Into your sanctum, you let 
them in / Now, all your loved ones and all you kin 
/ Will suffer punishments beneath the wrath of 
God / Never to forgive, never to forgive.” These 
lines wouldn’t pack nearly the same punch if, 
instead of a Satanic cardinal priest, an ordinary 
metalhead complete with a black tee, pasty skin 
and wispy, greasy hair said it. In fact, it would 
be comical, even farcical. The costumes are what 
allow the band to make the music that they do.
It may all seem like a gimmick, but Ghost’s 
act is more than a mere schtick. A quote from A 
Nameless Ghoul (presumed to be Tobias Forge 
himself) states that “(h)ad not the music been 
rocking, I don’t think that people would have 
gone gaga just about our looks. Had we not had 
the looks, I’m not sure we would have gotten the 
same attention.” This is to say that, regardless 
of looks, the music will always be good, but the 
costumes are what elevate and separate Ghost 
from the more pedestrian heavy metal acts of 
today. The costuming and lore allow the band 
to transcend reality, and, in a way, become even 
more metal.
Appearance 
doesn’t 
always 
dictate 
performance, but in the case of Ghost, the 
appearance of each members most certainly 
enhances their performance. Their appearance 
makes them that much more convincing, even 
when the band can’t be seen. The very thought of 
Ghost in full dress is enough to lure listeners into 
their Satanic world. When in costume, the band 
sinks fully into the music, unaware of the human 
world around them. 
If Ghost feels Satanic, they’ll play Satanic; If 
they play Satanic, they will make some of the 
most notable heavy metal out today.

This past Friday, “Diseducated,” a musical 
I spent the past six months writing with my 
friend Allison Taylor, was premiered through 
the Blank Space Workshop. This was a show 
I had initially conceived of this past October 
but hadn’t started working on in earnest until 
late March/early April, when Allie joined 
the project. It was something we spent the 
summer writing, something that utterly 
consumed this past September for us both as 
we worked frantically to notate the music we 
had heard in our heads for so long.
During the three-week workshop, we 
decided to make some radical changes to the 
plot structure that we hadn’t really touched in 
four or five months. In the first week, we cut 
two scenes and added one. Later, we moved 
the seventh scene into the third scene’s slot 
and the third scene to the very end of the first 
act. We cut two songs and added four. In the 
last week, we completely changed the point 
of view of the piece, deciding that making it 
take place in one character’s memory might 
make the first act more engaging.
And now, seven months after starting our 
work on the piece, Allie and I can’t help but 
think that our work has only begun. This is 
not to say we were unhappy with the piece 
we presented to our friends this past Friday. 
Deep down, however, we know that there 
are changes to be made to make the show 
even better — changes that we, as maturing 
musical theater writers, are beginning to 
understand.
This process has made me rethink one of 
my performing art pet peeves: the tendency 
of creative artists to continuously edit 
their work until it receives a professional 
premiere. It’s something that I’ve always 
struggled with as an audience member and 
a fan, particularly when it comes to seminal 
pieces of the repertoire that artists needlessly 
retouch after they reach their prime. I’ve 
always viewed it as a weakness — insecurity, 
perhaps or workaholic self-obsession — that 
these artists continue to edit their work 
despite its commercial and critical success.
Take Igor Stravinksy’s “The Firebird Suite,” 
for instance. “The Firebird” was Stravinsky’s 
first successful ballet score. It’s a staple of 
the 
contemporary 
orchestral 
repertoire. 
During his lifetime, Stravinsky created three 
different orchestral suites from the ballet 
score. Two of the suites, the 1911 and 1919, 
are both intended solely for the concert hall. 
The third, the 1945 suite commonly referred 
to as a “ballet suite,” comes much closer to 
approximating the ballet in full.
Was it really necessary for Stravinsky to 
continue editing after publishing his first 
suite? The discrepancies between these 
suites, after all, leads to much confusion 
among musicians and audience members. 
And though one of the suites does tend 
to be performed more than the others, no 
clear victor has won out. Is it not a point 
of weakness that Stravinsky continued to 
edit the work, that it took him 34 years to 
finally feel satisfied with his many different 
iterations of it?
One criterion that I used to apply to 
determine whether I thought this after-

publication “editing” was permissible or not 
is whether work had been changed to the 
point that it formed a new work. If the artist 
had stumbled upon a new form for their work, 
perhaps, or a different means of organizing it 
that better delivered it’s point, who was I to 
judge them for this?
Take Gustav Mahler’s “Symphony No. 
1,” for example. Between 1888 and 1898, 
Mahler created or edited six different 
editions of the orchestral score that have 
survived to the modern day. These different 
editions have lead to great confusion among 
orchestras, particularly when it comes to 
some of the minor edits that Mahler made to 
orchestration and the development sections 
of a few of the movements.
Nevertheless, I’ve always felt that Mahler’s 
editing was justified because of the big 
change that he makes to the overall structure 
of the work: between 1888 and 1898, Mahler 
decided to omit an entire movement. This 
large scale change completely alters a 
listener’s perception of the work; it is more 
than justified, in my view, though it was made 
so late after the work’s first publication.
Perhaps it was the size and substance of the 
edits that justified their latent application? 
Perhaps I was becoming annoyed not with 
the substance of the edits but with their knit 
picky nature. Perhaps grand, substantial 
edits were always justified, whereas minor 
semantic edits were not.
But then I thought about Francis Ford 
Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now Redux,” a 2001 
director’s cut of sorts that restored 41 minutes 
of previously cut footage to Coppola’s seminal 
film. Though Coppola’s additions added 
much to the film, it did little to change the 
substance of it. If anything, it added needless 
footage, making the plot more meandering, 
less direct and less entertaining overall.
Do we have to wait until an artist dies, I 
wondered, before we can assume that we’ve 
witnessed the artist’s complete artistic 
vision? And assuming that one agrees with 
my judgement of the two “Apocalypse Now” 
films, which should be considered to be the 
primary “Apocalypse Now” used to introduce 
new viewers to this film?
This leads me back to my own project, 
“Diseducated.” 
Though 
we’ve 
already 
premiered the piece, Allie and I plan on 
spending many more months revamping it. 
We hope to completely change it to make 
it more effective. Though we know that 
some audience members from our premiere 
probably have a vision of the show in their 
head, we are confident that we can improve 
upon it.
Rather than being annoyed at creative 
artists’s 
predilection 
towards 
constant 
editing, I’ve thus learned to accept it as a 
byproduct of this unusual profession. Allie 
and I, for example, can’t see any means 
of being happy with our show without 
extensively editing it and improving upon it. 
And even if we never stop editing it, I hope 
that audiences will be able to select between 
the different versions to find their personal 
favorite.
Perhaps it is ultimately up to fans and 
critics to determine which version of a work 
they are most happy with, and which they 
want to ignore. And rather than viewing this 
as a weakness, as an indicator of insecurity or 
self-obsession, perhaps it indicates a creative 
artist’s pride in their work and the degree to 
which they take it seriously. Perhaps instead 
of wishing for fewer late-stage edits, I should 
wish for more artists taking such an active 
role in the ongoing life of their work.

never being fully satisfied

HBO’s 
new 
teen 
drama, 
“Euphoria,” 
dominated social media in the summer of 2019 
and influenced teenagers across the nation 
to experiment with glittery eyeshadow and 
rhinestone eyelashes. The show’s Instagram 
account has amassed over one million followers, 
with many of the cast members boasting similar 
follower counts on social media. With a second 
season airing in 2020, “Euphoria” currently 
has the ratings for renewal and a stronghold on 
viewers’ attention, even a few months after its 
first season’s finale.
Throughout the airing of the first season, the 
show gained a popular following through Twitter 
as its explicit and shocking content made for great 
live-tweeting material. Once “Euphoria” gained 
traction online, influencers immediately jumped 
to replicate the street fashion that makes each 
character pop on an already mesmerizing show. 
The makeup and costuming departments have 
appeared in fashion publications like InStyle 
and Allure to explain how the 2019 show caught 
the audience’s attention with its unconventional 
stylistic choices.
Costume designer Heidi Bivens references 
real-world 
examples 
of 
streetwear 
and 
pedestrian yet fashion-forward looks to develop 
each character’s unique personal style. In 
an interview with Ssense, Bivens said main 
characters Jules and Rue were her favorite 
characters to develop visually, adding “There 
were no real rules in the approach with them, 
and when your creativity is boundless in terms of 
where you can go to in your mind to glean ideas, 
that’s the most exciting.” While the elaborate 
costumes maintain an air of fantasy and couture, 
each outfit seeks to mirror the images teenagers 
want to project in their own clothing.
The characters of “Euphoria” mix designer 
pieces with more pedestrian articles to heighten 
the most fashionable trends in American high 
schools. Some ready-to-wear pieces come from 
popular retailers like Target or Nordstrom, while 
designers like Zana Bayne and Akna provide more 
show-stopping items for moments of dramatic 
flair. Entire Instagram accounts and websites 
are dedicated to documenting every identifiable 
piece of clothing available to consumers looking 
to incorporate into their own wardrobes. 
While every episode features now-iconic 
looks, the clear stand-out is “The Next Episode” 
which plays on TV’s best trope: the Halloween 
party. In the context of a holiday celebrating 
the beauty of absurd costumes, “Euphoria” is 
at its stylistic height. Characters’ looks range 
from Marlene Dietrich’s tuxedoed glamor to a 

flawlessly executed Bob Ross, beard and all. The 
episode garnered so much media attention that 
websites like E! Online have published articles 
on how to reproduce Kat’s take on Thana from 
“Ms. 45” or Maddy’s modernized version of Jodie 
Foster in “Taxi Driver.”
“Euphoria” shows how much teen Halloween 
has changed since the highly memorable 
commentary in the 2004 comedy “Mean Girls.” 
In this film, the main character Cady describes 
the holiday as the opportunity for “the hardcore 
girls (to) just wear lingerie and some form of 
animal ears.” Although this may ring true for 
high school kids in the early 2000s, “Euphoria” 
demonstrates how Halloween has become about 
a lot more than wearing the quintessential 
“sexy” costume. While some characters’ outfits 
are revealing or sexualized versions of pop 
culture figures, the artistry and concepts of their 
ensemble are far more important. 
In one particularly emotional scene of “The 
Next Episode,” Cassie attends a Halloween party 
at her boyfriend’s college but is told to change 
her risqué costume based on Alabama Worley 
from “True Romance.” Her boyfriend feels the 
outfit would attract too much sexual attention 
from other men and offers her his football jersey 
to wear instead. Cassie sadly responds, “This 
isn’t even a real costume.” Her disappointment at 
being told to switch outfits comes not only from 
the manipulative behavior that guilted her into 
changing but also from her inability to express 
herself and show off what she had made. 
For the characters of “Euphoria,” the clothes 
they wear are not just clothes. The makeup 
they wear is not just makeup. The goal isn’t to 
look pretty or desirable or cool. For Rue, Jules, 
Maddy, Cassie, Kat and everyone else on the 
show, how you present yourself is the best and 
only way to show who you are or, in some cases, 
who you want to be. In the wash of neon lights 
and glitter-soaked tears, each costume or outfit 
worn brilliantly reflects the growth and conflict 
within each character’s arc.
“Euphoria” at its core wants to depict life as 
it is, or even how it seems to be, in 2019. Issues 
like revenge porn, opioid addiction and climate 
change define the lives of the East Highland 
students the show follows. Even if the content of 
the series is heightened for dramatic effect, the 
key elements are grounded in the reality of how it 
feels to be in high school right now. Every day is 
a chance to reinvent yourself to your classmates, 
and the young audience of “Euphoria” is 
inspired by the creativity of these fan-favorite 
characters they see themselves in. As Halloween 
approaches, there’s no doubt social media will 
be full of “Euphoria”-themed costumes as fans 
get a chance to go all out and pay tribute to TV’s 
newest hit.

Once “Euphoria” gained traction online, 
influencers immediately jumped to replicate the 
street fashion that makes each character pop on 
an already mesmerizing show. The makeup and 
costuming departments have appeared in fashion 
publications like InStyle and Allure to explain how 
the 2019 show caught the audience’s attention with 
its unconventional stylistic choices.

Allie and I, for 
example, can’t 
see any means of 
being happy with 
our show without 
extensively editing 
it and improving 
upon it. And even 
if we never stop 
editing it, I hope 
that audiences 
will be able to 
select between the 
different versions 
to find their 
personal favorite.

B-SIDE: SECONDARY

It’s Halloween, and that means I have to find a costume. It’s not that I don’t have any ideas 
— I have plenty. There’s always Mulan, I’ve wanted to be a piece of sushi since freshman year 
and, quite honestly, Waldo doesn’t seem too bad right about now. But I have a few issues with 
Halloween costumes. First of all, Halloween is in the middle of the semester and I like to try and 
DIY what I wear; not a very good combination of activities, if you ask me. Second, you’re telling me 
I have to spend money on something I’m probably only ever going to wear once? I will do that for 
Christmas and maybe even New Year’s, but Halloween is a no-go. 
None of this is to say that I don’t like costumes or Halloween. I love both of them, it’s just 
that together, they can add up to a lot of work. So this year, instead of stressing over making a 
Halloween costume, I went to talk to the University Costume Shop about how they make costumes 
for various shows. Though the amount of work and time that goes into making a Halloween 
costume is daunting, it’s nothing compared to what goes behind the scenes for many University 
productions. 
Before actually going to the costume shop, however, they recommend you watch “What to 
Expect at the University Costume Shop.” It’s an introductory video and gives an overview of 
everything from how to get there to what happens at your final fitting. Unsurprisingly, the video is 
entertaining and informative, a well-made production perfect for anyone who wants to take a visit 
to the costume shop but finds themselves without the necessary talent to be cast in a University 
production. 
Located on the second floor of the Walgreen Drama Center on North Campus, the University 
Costume Shop is a dream for performers and sewers alike. Upon walking in, dress forms are 
scattered throughout the shop and sewing machines sit in rows, some mid-project, others available 
for whatever the staff throws at them. At one point, I was distracted by the fact that some of 
the outlets hung from the ceiling, suspended on a track that could follow someone along as they 
ironed a larger piece. To be able to iron all in one go without the length of a cord to hold you back 
is something I’ve only dreamed of, and to see it in person at the costume shop was unimaginable. 
The physical aspects of the shop, however, would mean nothing without the people who use them. 
The costume shop’s team is composed of a costume shop manager, costume designer, wardrobe 
supervisor and multiple drapers. All these people come together to create the masterpieces you see 
on stage — to listen to them talk to about each of their creations and the shows they’ve worked on 
is like stepping into another world. 
But how do you even get into that world in the first place? It’s a different process for everyone. 
Take Lea Morello, a draper at the University Costume Shop. A philosophy major in college, she has 
been working with the costume shop since 2002 and has been in costumes for around 24 years. 
Though her love of sewing came from what she was doing as a stay-at-home mom, it started to 
become something more when Morello got a job as a part-time stitcher at the University Costume 
Shop. From there, she ended up going back to school for theater design and production and, 
eventually, found herself at the costume shop as a draper. The rest is history — a really impressive 
history, if you ask me.
Others, though, have always known that in some capacity, they’ll end up in theater. Christianne 
Meyers, a designer at the costume shop, grew up backstage watching her mother dance and 
eventually found her niche as a designer by the time college came around. For her, design was 
a way of merging her fascination with behind-the-scenes work and her love for art. With a BFA 
from Pace University, she spent a few years working in New York City, where she eventually got 
her masters at NYU. Afterward, she stayed in the city freelancing on a variety of projects off-
Broadway and in regional theaters. In time, she realized that working 60 or more hours a week 
and living in the competitive culture of the New York City costume industry wasn’t for her. Come 
2002, Meyers joined the University Costume Shop along with Morello and has designed 45 shows 
in the last 17 years.
While Morello and Meyers are important staples at the University Costume Shop, it is still a 
university costume shop, and would be incomplete without the presence of students honing their 
craft. Saawan Tiwari, a senior pursuing his BFA in theater design, talked about his life behind 
the scenes, a five-year-process that actually started in zoology. Though most of his time had been 
spent at a zoo rather than a studio in high school, he always jumped on the opportunity to work 
on a school play. His first project? Creating a donkey head for “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” 
With little to no crafting background, Tiwari pulled together what he described as a “helmet 
contraption” with a wig glued onto it. Obviously, the donkey head was named Bernard. And while 
his first foray into costumes was not the most conventional, what Tiwari did have was a “hot glue 
gun and a dream,” the only things you really need to make it in theater. 
It took a few steps for Morello, Meyers and Tiwari to make it to the University Costume Shop, 
but they all eventually did. So, what does creating a costume actually entail? More often than 
not, it starts with the designer working with the director to come up with a vision for the show. 
The meetings can range from idea sessions on each side, with directors only coming with vague 
concepts of what they want, to detailed brainstorming inspired by a director who has everything 
mapped out in their head. 
But costumers can’t rely just on what the director wants — they have to know the actual show inside 
and out, too. From quick changes between scenes to historical renditions of various characters, 
costume designers are resident experts in every show they work on. Oftentimes, the designers and 
other costume makers know more about a production than the cast themselves, especially at the 
beginning. In order to effectively design a show, Meyers emphasized the importance of being able 
to make a decision and move on with it. “Designing is deciding,” according to Meyers. It’s also not 
surprising for them to start designing and choosing costumes before the show is even fully casted. 
Construction of the costume is everything from the undergarments to the makeup, so being not 
only familiar, but intimate with the director’s vision and the show is critical to developing good 
costumes. 
Understanding a show is an art in and of itself — Meyers noted that sometimes they do brand new 
shows while some have been done for centuries. Currently, the shop is working on the University 

production of famed opera “La Bohème” and as Meyers said, “they have been singing those same 
notes for 200 years.” In a case like “La Bohème,” where the director has put on the show four 
times and Meyers herself has worked on it before, designers understand the minute details of the 
show already. It’s an entirely different thing when the show has never been done or seen before. 
At times, they’re working on something where some of the cast and characters aren’t even worked 
out until the first rehearsal. It’s a dynamic job that takes a level of creative flexibility many wish 
they had. 
Once the designs are worked out, and even as they’re being finalized, they go to a draper, like 
Morello, who takes the ideas from their 2-D rendering to a 3-D mockup. This process can often 
vary — it might even start from a newly bought piece of clothing. In fact, one of the skirts for the 
upcoming “La Bohème” is a dyed skirt from Mod Cloth. When costumes do start from scratch, 
however, they go through a rigorous process that transforms them from an idea on some muslin 
to a piece of art on stage. Throughout fittings, Morello is constantly adjusting, looking where she 
can bring things in and take things out, aware of the fact that a costume is made to fit the person 
rather than the person to the costume. 
That attitude, however, is a more recent one, especially as more and more people are learning 
to embrace their body’s natural curves and lines. Both Meyers and Morello have worked in the 
industry for a little over two decades and have been at the University Costume Shop for 17 of those 
years. So, not only have they seen changing attitudes when it comes to body positivity, but they 
have also seen an increasingly diverse set of casts come through their doors. No longer does the 
typical tan work to fit every skin tone of a cast. The costume shop is cognizant of the diversity 
of their actors and always takes a skin tone swatch, a basic technique that can go a long way in 
making an actor feel comfortable in their costume. Morello highlighted the roles of directors 
in facilitating this change. She worked on a production of “Romeo and Juliet” that ignored the 
traditional casting and opted instead to explore the tensions that an interracial couple might 
experience in the production. 
Not everything has changed for the better, though. With how short audience attention spans can 
be, the demand for speed has increased dramatically within the industry. Sure, that might mean 
more costumes and more shows, but it takes away from the creative process — what you get in 
speed, you lose in what Meyers deems “cogitation time,” which is the time that an idea just sits in 
the back of your head. Waiting until that moment of revelation and the designs just come together. 
Knowing how their creative processes reacts to the speedy needs of various shows is just one 
of the ways these artists have been shaped by their experiences working in the costume industry. 
Morello noted the importance of knowing your boundaries and how to prioritize projects — she is 
still able to make costumes for her grandkids while working at the costume shop by splitting who 
gets a costume which year. 
Tiwari spent the second semester of his freshman year taking 17 credits and trying to put 
together three different shows. One of these shows had a $150 budget for a large ensemble that saw 
some questionable communication between designer and director. But he got it done, as an unpaid 
freshman, and it was still one of his favorite shows. The lesson here is that 17 credits is never a 
good idea, regardless of whether you’re running three shows and volunteering at the same time. 
But, beyond that, Tiwari emphasized the importance of pushing your boundaries and figuring out 
how to put yourself and what you want first. That is something we could all stand to learn at least 
once in our lives. 
Meyers drove home the idea that learning to let go is one of the biggest skills you can have as 
a designer. As a freelancer, she designed and made two $750 dresses for one of her shows that, 
eventually, the director decided to cut from the show. The same director “turned the set upside 
down.” So, what is a designer supposed to do when their work is tossed aside? For Meyers, the 
answer wasn’t to get angry or hold a grudge: Instead, she ended up shopping at Vivienne Tam’s 
studio with Frances McDormand. The whole thing happened relatively early on in her career, and 
Meyers was happy to note that now she is able to take things as they are and address problems in a 
cool, collected manner. The mark of a true professional.
So, where does all this leave me in my hunt for a Halloween costume? I have a wig. I did not design 
a full show or costumes for my grandkids. But it’s a step in the right direction. And, honestly, after 
seeing what costumers have to go through, that might be my only step. The staff at the University 
Costume Shop have been through it all and still make up a cast worthy of the productions they 
help create.

I’ve got big dreams and exactly one hot glue gun: Going
behind the scenes of our sweet University Costume Shop

It’s hard to overstate the cultural significance of Bob Mackie. 
While his legacy is intractable from that of Cher (being responsible 
for her most iconic looks), his work spans from his sketch work 
for Edith Head and Jean Louis in the early ’60s (including the 
dress that Marilyn Monroe sang “Happy Birthday” to President 
John F. Kennedy in), to assisting his future lifetime partner, Ray 
Aghayan, on “The Judy Garland Show” and “The Carol Burnett 
Show,” to his work with Cher and just about every celebrity of 
note over the course of the mid-to-late 20th 
century. His career spans almost 60 years, but 
his eponymous ready-to-wear line, Bob Mackie 
Originals, was comparatively short-lived and 
failed to fuel him in the same way as the work 
he’s done designing for studios, Broadway 
shows and world tours. Unlike other designers 
considered to be a household name, Mackie 
didn’t build a brand that was marketable to the 
public — he’s never stepped out and done the 
creative direction for a massive conglomerate, 
designed an it-bag or even thrown his name 
upon a storefront. Even during his years doing a 
ready-to-wear line, he has never been that guy. 
Bob Mackie has spent his years in pursuit of 
the costume, stitching together an endless sea 
of paillettes and Marabous, creating marvelous 
and fleeting moments that live on in history 
through photographs. 
Part of what draws people to special events 
is their temporality. There’s a special brand of 
allure that comes with only being able to wear 
or see something once, and one of the central 
tenets of the costume is that it’s meant to be 

frivolous. The visual arts have historically been discredited due 
to their political feminization — high fashion is often viewed as 
wasteful and gluttonous, with little regard given to its greater 
societal impact or its role in the economy. Red carpet looks and 
garments used for tours and on sets for TV shows are at the most 
unlucky intersection of perceived inaccessibility, wastefulness and 
feminized discreditation. This may be why Bob Mackie never had 
the opportunity to brand himself the way that, say, a longstanding 
leather goods company with a high fashion line already has built 
into it. He never fought to turn his name into a behemoth. He 
didn’t capitalize on the media frenzy that his work has created 
time and time again. There were perfumes, sure. There was 

a ready-to-wear line and a QVC collaboration. There’s even a 
limited collection of Barbies. But Bob Mackie is a tried and true 
dressmaker. He is a costumer who has undoubtedly helped shape 
how the world considers what is possible in fashion. 
To commit oneself to the costume, either through embodying 
it over the course of a night or, in Mackie’s case, a lifetime, is to 
commit oneself completely to a fantasy and throw caution to the 
wind. Excess and unadulterated flair have external validity in a 
capitalist marketplace (if that’s your thing) when they become a 
source of inspiration, but the point is that cannot happen if any 
mind is given to whether or not bits and bobs can be reinterpreted 
into something consumable. Bob Mackie may have (mainly) 
worked for pop stars and production studios, 
thus needing in some way to interact with the 
notion of acceptability in his work, but he has 
spent the majority of his career unbeholden to 
retail sales. References to Sontag’s 1964 essay 
“Notes on Camp” have reached their saturation 
point, but she refers to the concept of visual 
camp in this way, arguing that camp turns its 
back on the good-bad axis of ordinary aesthetic 
judgment. Camp doesn’t reverse things. It 
doesn’t argue the good is bad, or the bad is good. 
What it does is to offer art (and life) a different 
— and supplementary — set of standards.
To realize a concept with the purest intention 
possible, as Mackie often did, is not to concern 
oneself with what’s considered to be in good 
taste, or possessing the proper ingredients 
to achieve a certain level of popularity. It 
is to pursue a vision to its fullest extent, 
communicating an idea with the greatest level 
of efficacy that can be achieved. Bob Mackie 
took the absurd and brought it to the eyes of 
the mainstream, and we’ll be forever grateful 
for it.

In the last week, even the least bothered of us have considered some of 
the angles we may take with our costumes this year. With three years of 
Halloween in Ann Arbor in the bag, the following is what I’ve solidified as 
the categories that encompass 95 percent of costumes on show and they’re 
the spooky truth. 
The Nostalgic Costume
The shrieks and sobs produced by a nostalgia-inducing costume are the 
reason for the popularity of this category around campus. As we’re all from 
different places, we seek the ties that bind us — nationally-televised ’00s 
cartoons, the club hits that played at elementary school birthday parties, 
the earliest memes of 2011 or 2012. Finding the Cosmo to our Wanda or the 
milk to our Reese’s Puffs or the Brad to our Angelina on a night out instantly 
elevates such an interaction to one of predestiny. Whether as points of 
shared love or sharp contention, nostalgic costumes carry emotion without 
much conceptual or executional heavy-lifting. 
The Sexy Costume
The thirst trap has been so fully integrated into university costume 
culture that it could almost be a costume in itself. For a few years only 
certain costumes were sexualized — cats, nurses, Freddie Mercury. But 
now, it wouldn’t be so radical to conceive of a sexy Cheerio. When people 
asked me for costume advice this year, I reminded them that the point of 
Halloween is to look good. This can’t, however, be at the expense of the idea 
itself. If you go as a mafioso just because you look good in a white button-
down and want to fiend cigarettes all night, your costume is actually not 
that great. 
The Scary Costume
Being scary on Halloween just doesn’t have the same appeal it did as a 

kid. At this point, completely unwillingly and regretfully, I’ve seen actual 
beheadings online. Costumes in this category these days are therefore either 
terrifying or trivialized by an undeniable layer of sex appeal. A costume that 
attempts but fails at scariness should either adapt to satirizing/sexualizing 
itself or it should go home.
The Niche Costume
The thrill of the arts, baby. Some of us ride or die so hard for particularly 
influential figures in our respective fields of interest to the extent that we 
forget their existence is known by maybe 10 percent of our peers. When it 
comes to the big day, we prep for hours putting the finishing touches on a 
representation that channels this character or person’s very soul. But the 
night only breeds disappointment and demoralization as our peers don’t 
even know who Rick Owens is and we get guesses from Keanu Reeves to 
Steven Tyler (that’s just bad).
The Pregame-Decided Costume
While some of us workshop costumes in our phone’s notes app for 
months before the actual events of Halloweek, others of us couldn’t be 
bothered to think critically enough about it until the big night itself. 
Thankfully, though, some girl at the pregame needs a boy to complete her 
Taylor-Swift-in-the-“You Belong With Me”-music-video look. 
The “Number of Friends You Have” Costume
If you’ve got one friend, you’re good for Batman and Robin, maybe a 
pair of boobs. Two guys and a girl? Harry, Ron and Hermione. Four Mean 
Girls. Five Spice Girls. Incestuous squad of six? Friends. Conceive of this: 
going as the seven continents! Or maybe the eight directions on a compass. 
Nine ladies dancing? Ten beer pong cups. Eventually you can just be 
Brockhampton.
The “Just Abstract” Costume
Many of us have likely seen the Buzzfeed concept of going with a t-shirt 
that says “life” on it and a bag of lemons to give people. I did this my senior 
year of high school. But with an internet culture that hybridizes and layers 

references more than ever before, as well as new generations of students 
who spent a larger percentage of their formative years within this culture, 
Halloween has begun to reflect such thinking. You could go as super-
thicc, but specifically the distorted Photo Booth “Twirl” effect version of 
this. You could go as the hissing cat meme itself. You could go as “Bort,” 
the poorly drawn meme version of Bart Simpson. You could ironically go as 
the tapestry and Christmas lights that your roommate put up because they 
don’t represent you. You could go as the video-game screencap of “Ah shit, 
here we go again.” You could go as the generic vaporwave mannequin in a 
suit with a big “stonks” sign, or better yet you could go as a bar graph of our 
national debt with block text over it that says, “Honestly I’m just fucking 
vibing rn.” 
All angles have the potential for success, but only in their purest form. 
The only thing worse than a bad costume on Halloween is not going all-
in. So even if you’re Taylor Swift’s boy-toy from that music video every 
else seems to know, you’re gonna take photos with her and the signs you 
supposedly have to flash one another from your windows, and you sure as 
hell are gonna get that slow dance at the end of the night.

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘ORPHANS’ & ‘ARABESQUE’

After 
nearly 
five 
years, 
Coldplay has emerged from 
musical stagnation with two 
singles off their upcoming 
album, Everyday Life. The 
album’s title seems to be the 
exact 
premise 
of 
the 
singles, celebrating the 
small moments in life 
with a blend of saxophone 
solos, bluesy guitar riffs 
and dynamic horns. 
“Orphans” sounds like 
the Coldplay we’ve heard 
on past albums, with 
its bubbly “woo-woos” 
and Chris Martin’s passionate 
chanting 
throughout 
the 
verses. The lyrics are nostalgic 
in nature, walking through the 
loneliness of being away from 
home while still maintaining 
an overwhelming and spirited 
sensation of freedom. The tune 
ends with an overpowering 

blend of drums and background 
vocals as Martin sings the line 
“I want to be with you ‘till the 
whole world ends,” crafting the 
signature Coldplay euphoria. 
“Arabesque” 
is 
more 

experimental in nature, slightly 
deviating from Coldplay’s soft 
rock tradition. The tune starts 
off with noises from a bustling 
city and transitions into an 
angular guitar riff before the 
introduction of a protrusive 
horn section that has its 
own solo towards the end of 

the song. Unlike “Orphans,” 
“Arabesque” is more lyrically 
abstract as it attempts to 
deconstruct Western fears of 
Islam in the wake of terrorism. 
Interwoven in the folk sounds 
are Middle Eastern motifs, 
such as the prominence of 
percussion 
instruments 
and the usage of horns.
Despite the time away, 
Coldplay 
still 
sounds 
like the euphoric rock 
band 
they 
established 
themselves as back in the 
’90s. While “Arabesque” 
slightly diverges from their 
traditional rock sound, both 
singles revisit the signature 
sound of the band. The singles 
are complex yet captivating and 
serve as a promising precursor 
to Everyday Life.

‘I THINK’

Tyler, the Creator

Columbia Records

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘I THINK’

Tyler, the Creator’s IGOR alter 
ego, Wolf Daley, returns with 
the music video for “I THINK.” 
Directed under Tyler’s Wolf 
Haley alias, the video features a 
caption that reads “a fraction of 
the video*,” indicating more to 
come. The lavish scenery of “A 
BOY IS A GUN” is replaced by 
a grimy club scene — a sketchy 
restroom, 
claustrophobia, 
reprehensible 
hookups 
and all. Whereas Daley’s 
last appearance reflected 
a 
more 
emotionally 
unhinged side, “I THINK” 
is less dramatic, zeroing in 
on a simpler narrative many 
of us can relate to with 
some comical glimmers 
along the way. Wolf dons an 
on-brand pastel Neapolitan suit, 
his signature bowl-cut wig and 
tinted sunglasses as he wanders 
aimlessly in pursuit of yet another 
Timothee Chalamet-esque love 
interest in the club. 
A ’70s clad crew of men 
sequester themselves at the edge 
of a bleak restroom, rolling dice at 

the very beginning of the video. 
From there, the video pans and we 
find Wolf stepping up to use one 
of the urinals as a couple leaves a 
stall and some people walk in and 
out of the entrance. Wolf then 
makes his way to the bathroom 
mirror where he sings the song’s 
lyrics while preening himself. 
Hell breaks loose when a fistfight 
occurs between the men from 

earlier, and Wolf is shoved out 
of the bathroom and into a wall. 
Unbothered by his surroundings, 
he ventures into the club, pushing 
and shoving his way to his 
unknowing love interest. From 
here, we pan to a photo shoot of 
various characters from earlier 
in the video, including Tyler, the 
Creator in GOLF gear, Kendall 

Jenner and then finally Wolf, who 
occupies the last quarter of the 
video. The camera then zooms in 
on a forlorn Wolf and then looks 
up to a hand on his shoulder, 
presumably that of the individual 
he pursued earlier. 
The video is an anomaly in the 
series of IGOR videos. Rather than 
presenting Wolf as the primary 
focus of the video, it provides 
insight into the experiences 
of other people at the 
club. This effect is more 
humorous than anything 
else, Wolf sticking out like a 
sore thumb, neglecting the 
interactions 
surrounding 
him in his ridiculous garb. 
There’s a comical backbone 
to this video, but it doesn’t 
overpower its sincerity the way it 
does in “EARFQUAKE.” Rather, 
it embraces the all-consuming 
nature 
of 
love, 
awkwardly 
unfolding in a casual club scene 
we’ve all experienced before.
