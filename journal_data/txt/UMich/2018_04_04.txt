LSA Dean Andrew Martin 

sent out an email to all LSA 
department chairs last month 
informing 
them 
the 
LSA 

Executive 
Committee 
has 

reached the decision to halt 
the production of new minors 
housed within LSA and for LSA 
students at the University of 
Michigan.

The 
LSA 
Curriculum 

Committee will take time until 
the end of fall semester 2018 to 
review the current and existing 
minors within LSA. Currently, 
LSA offers 111 minors. 

LSA Associate Dean Angela 

Dillard, who serves as the 
chair for the LSA CC, said the 

increasing number of minors in 
the college was becoming more 
difficult to navigate.

“The growing number of 

minors, 
and 
the 
confusion 

caused 
by 
the 
increasingly 

complex relationship between 
and among them (prompted 
the decision),” Dillard wrote in 
an email. “Some minors are in 
separate units but very close to 
each other in content and focus. 
There is also a general lack 
of guidance from the College 
about the requirements for new 
and existing minors that seems 
worthwhile to address.” 

Dillard wrote it is also 

possible 
some 
smaller 

minors may be suspended or 
re-conceptualized.

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel has been working 

In the wake of a blackface 

incident involving Snapchat on 
campus, History Club at the 
University of Michigan hosted 
a dialogue Tuesday evening to 
examine the historical roots 
of the blackface caricature 
and its harmful modern-day 
implications.

The racist Snapchat was 

posted 
by 
LSA 
sophomore 

Lauren Fokken wearing a black 
face mask with the caption 
“#blacklivesmatter.”

Stephen Berrey, associate 

professor in the Department 
of 
American 
Culture, 
led 

Tuesday’s 
conversation, 

providing insight into how 
the blackface caricature has 
evolved 
from 
19th-century 

minstrel shows to the ultimate 
“taboo” of blackface by 1980.

When 
Berrey 
introduced 

himself, 
he 
said 
cultural 

conversation on blackface, and 
its racist implications, is largely 
neglected.

“I would say that the majority 

of people in this country know 
that it is wrong or know that 
on some level it is offensive but 
not necessarily why or how it is 
this symbol that is connected to 
this much over history,” Berrey 
said.

The 
earliest 
historical 

evidence of blackface is linked 
to T.D. Rice, a white entertainer 
in 
the 
late 
1820s 
who 

popularized an act imitating an 
African-American man he met 
on the street who he claimed 
was named “Jim Crow.” Over 
time, Rice began to burn cork 
and rub the black residue over 
his face.

“All of minstrelsy is about 

imagining, rather than the 
diversity and the humanity of a 
population, reducing it to a few 
stock caricatures representing 
millions of people,” Berrey said.

Despite the fact Rice began 

the blackface act in New 
Orleans, 
Berrey 
cited 
how 

blackface minstrel shows were 

most popular in the Midwest 
and Northeast. The rowdy 
audiences 
attending 
these 

shows 
were 
mostly 
white, 

working-class men from states 
such as Ohio, New York and 
Kentucky.

As blackface minstrel shows 

reached their peak popularity 
during the mid-19th century, 
hallmarks of the blackface 
caricature began to emerge 
including 
“minstrel 
black” 

makeup, 
white 
gloves 
and 

mocking dialect patterns.

By the early 20th century, 

blackface 
minstrel 
shows 

experienced 
a 
professional 

decline.Yet, 
blackface 

continued to be a welcome 
image of American culture 
well into the 20th century, 
evidenced by the traces of 
blackface imagery in cartoons, 
advertising and film characters.

Berrey engaged students in 

attendance by passing around 
blackface pamphlets from the 
20th century including how-
to guides, blackface makeup 
catalogs and blackface show 
scripts. Berrey has accumulated 
an archive of blackface artifacts 

Information senior Ibrahim 

Rasheed said he knows he 
took “two or three” courses 
at the University of Michigan 
that fulfill LSA’s Race and 
Ethnicity 
requirement, 
but 

cannot recall which ones they 
were. After spending a few 
minutes searching for his LSA 
audit to no avail, he decided 
that one of the courses was 
most likely titled, “The History 
of Islam in South Asia.” After 
checking the LSA course guide, 
he found that the course did in 
fact fulfill the requirement.

Rasheed, who is a South 

Asian Muslim, said he took 
the course in order to learn 
more about the history of 
his culture and religion as it 
explores the tensions of being 
Muslim in South Asia and the 
role of Muslims in South Asian 
society.

Rasheed took the course 

because of the subject matter, 
and the fact it fulfilled a 
requirement was a “bonus.”

Research 
Assistant 

Professor Margaret Hicken’s lab 
at the University of Michigan, 
the word vigilance takes on a 
new meaning — as in, the stress 
associated with carrying the 
burden of one’s race whenever 
one walks out the door. Through 
her 
research 
and 
findings, 

Hicken said she has associated 
this vigilance with unhealthy 
habits that could be contributing 
to obesity among marginalized 
communities.

“Vigilance is a lay word; it’s just 

part of our regular vocabulary,” 
Hicken said. “But the way I use 
it that it’s the anticipatory stress 
or the worry-related stress about 
structural and cultural racism. 
So it’s not about discrimination 
or about one person being mean 
to another person. I’m talking 
about the stereotypes that we 
hold of marginalized groups, and 
then the actions that we take as 
a society to marginalize different 
racial groups.”

Be careful where you put 

your Zingerman’s sandwich this 
summer — you might just watch 
it get carried away by a group of 
children and their human-sized 
ant leader.

Tuesday, 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 

Summer Festival announced the 
2018 month-long event would 

include performances by eVenti 
Verticali’s 2-D and 3-D show 
“Wanted,” as well as Australia’s 
Polyglot Theatre production of 
Ants.

EVenti Verticali is an Italian 

multimedia 
aerial 
theater 

company that involves visual 
comedy projected onto a large 
outdoor screen. The group travels 
the world showcasing their art 
and will be in Ann Arbor for the 
Top of the Park festival on June 
19 and 20.

Polyglot Theatre’s Ants will 

also be in Ann Arbor this June. 
Their 
show 
includes 
actors 

dressed as giant ants leading 
children through an activity 
of placing breadcrumbs into 
artistic designs. The Polyglot 
Theatre, based in Australia, is 
internationally 
regarded 
for 

their “interactive spectacle for 
children.”

“Faced with hundreds of giant 

bread crumbs and three big 
insects, children are irresistibly 

drawn in to discover what the 
ants want them to do,” the AASF’s 
website 
states. 
“Gradually 
a 

world 
of 
meaning 
unfolds, 

illustrating the human desire for 
order by transforming any public 
space with wavering lines and 
patterns, crossing adult lines and 
disrupting the everyday.”

The AASF will take place 

June 8 through July 1, with Ants 
making a special appearance 
June 26 through June 28.

WASHINGTON - Six years 

ago, Barbara Grutter was 
looking over a letter of rejec-
tion from the Law School. 
Today, she will look over nine 
Supreme Court justices as 
they hear her lawyers argue 
that she was denied admission 
because of an illegal system of 
racial preference.

The hearing today is the 

result of a lawsuit she filed to 
challenge the school’s use of 
race in its admissions policies.

“We all feel very much a 

sense of ‘We need to be, here, 
and it’s time for us to be here,”’ 
Grutter said at a press confer-
ence yesterday with Jennifer 
Gratz and’ Patrick Hamacher, 
the two plaintiffs suing the 
College of Literature, Science 
and the Arts for its race-con-
scious admissions policies.

All three applicants said 

they were feeling a wide range 
of emotions in the hours 
preceding the start of the oral 
arguments that the court will 
hear at 10 a.m. today. They 
added that these cases are 
more about discrimination by 
the University on the basis 
of their skin color than the 
methods or actual policies of 
the Law School or LSA.

“We are taught in our 

schools and in our homes 
and in our churches that you 

should never judge another 
person based on her skin 
color,” Gratz said at the con-
ference, which was organized 
by the Center for Individual 
Rights, the law firm represent-
ing the plaintiffs.

“Patrick, Barbara and I are 

asking only that everyone be 
judged according to the same 
standard, regardless of race. 
That’s what the Constitution 
requires, and that’s what we’ll 
ask the Supreme Court to reaf-
firm tomorrow.”

Hamacher said his 3.3 grade 

point average, a score of 28 on 
the ACT and numerous extra-
curricular activities merited 
acceptance into the University. 

“Like Jennifer Gratz, and 

many hundreds of other white 
and Asian applicants, I wasn’t 
treated fairly by the Univer-
sity of Michigan because they 
explicitly considered our race 
to be a negative factor,” Ham-
acher said.

Although they said the Uni-

versity’s policies discriminated 
against them, all three appli-
cants said they want to pursue 
graduate-level education and 
would still consider attending 
the Uni-

versity. Grutter, a 49-year-

old mother of two and health 
care information technology 
consultant in Michigan, said 

she plans to reapply 
to the Law School if 
the court requires it 
to use a race-neutral 
policy.

“I have not relin-

quished the desire to 
combine the practice 
of law with health 
care information 
system management,” 
she said.

Hamacher, a 

24-year-old ac-
countant from Flint, 
said he hopes to 
apply to the Gerald 
R. Ford School of 
Public Policy if the 
court rules in his 
favor. Gratz, who is 
25 years old and a 
software trainer in 
Oceanside, Calif., said 
she would consider 
attending a Univer-
sity graduate school 
but may choose a 
school closer to her 
current home.

CIR President Terence Pell 

also spoke at the conference, 
saying he believes the Univer-
sity has “operated blatantly 
segregated, two-track admis-
sions systems designed to 
boost the number of minori-
ties.”

Although he refused to pre-

dict the court’s ruling, which 
is expected to be announced 
in June, Pell said he considers 
a clear, sweeping ban on race-
conscious admissions policies 
a victory.

If the court upholds both 

policies, “there will be no end 
to (the University’s) type of 
racial engineering,” Pell said.

THROUGH LAWSUITS ON RACE SANCTIONS

MAYA GODLMAN

Daily News Editor

ON THE DAILY: ANTS IN ANN ARBOR 

the School of Information, 
which does not have a Race and 
Ethnicity course requirement, 
he said he still views the 
requirement as problematic.

“Race and Ethnicity is not 

the forefront purpose of the 
course,” Rasheed said. “Right 
now, Race and Ethnicity, it’s 
like the second addition, or 
the add-on. It’s a bonus. You 
don’t take Race and Ethnicity 
courses with the intention of 
thinking deeply about race and 
ethnicity. You take it for the 
subject, and it just so happens 
that it gets qualified as being 
a Race and Ethnicity course.”

Rasheed 
is 
not 
alone. 

Many students, particularly 
students 
of 
color, 
have 

expressed 
they 
take 
issue 

with the requirement. Most 

cite the watering down of 
what 
constitutes 
a 
Race 

and 
Ethnicity 
course, 
as 

well 
as 
the 
inconsistency 

regarding which colleges at 
the University require it, as 
a problem. Currently, LSA, 
the Ford School of Public 
Policy and the Stamps School 
of Art and Design require 
Race and Ethnicity credit for 
undergraduates.

The Race and Ethnicity 

requirement 
was 
formed 

after student activists lobbied 
the University to institute a 
requirement following racial 
tensions on campus. Public 
Policy junior Allie Brown, 
a contributor to The Daily, 
helped LSA Associate Dean 
Angela Dillard complete a 
public history project on the 
requirement, 
and 
believes 

the requirement has been 
“watered down” and does not 
live up to its mission.

“The purpose of the Race 

and Ethnicity requirement is 
to get white people to be a little 
less racist, for people to be a 
little bit more knowledgeable 
about the world they live in,” 
Brown said. “That’s really 
what it came about after the 
activism. Not just, ‘Oh, learn 
about race and ethnicity in 
general.’ That’s not really the 
purpose behind it. A lot of 
the courses that are counted 
as R&E today don’t require 
cultural competency, that’s 
the problem. It’s just like, ‘Oh, 
we mention race and ethnicity, 
thus we should be counted as 
Race and Ethnicity.’ ”

Like Brown, Rasheed thinks 

the requirement should focus 
on cultural competency and 
on 
helping 
students 
make 

present-day 
connections 

to material learned in the 
classroom.

“I didn’t learn from (The 

History of Islam in South 
Asia) what the intention of 
R&E is meant to be, which is 
empathizing 
with 
others,” 

Rasheed 
said. 
“I 
simply 

interpreted it as a history 
course, not as an R&E course, 
which is supposed to help 
me grow as a person. I’m 
not familiar with how a 
course qualifies as an R&E 
course, but I would say that 
it wasn’t a course that made 
me think deeply about race 
and ethnicity as a whole and 
how we’re supposed to take 
lessons from then and apply it 
to right now, which I think is 
the intention of the race and 
ethnicity course.”

Public Policy junior Kyra 

Hudson agrees and thinks 
it’s important for students to 
realize that race and ethnicity 
issues occur in “real-time.”

“The Race and Ethnicity 

requirement was born out 
of student activist demands 
in response to racism and a 
turbulent racial climate on 
campus and also in society and 
the world,” Hudson said. “And 
so the fact that somebody can 
take the class that doesn’t ever 

touch on the current racial 
climate, your place within 
it, it doesn’t ever mention 
how its affecting students 
real-time. I don’t think it’s 
acceptable to call it something 
that will fulfill your Race and 
Ethnicity requirement if it 
doesn’t engage with race and 
ethnicity in a real capacity. I 
think it needs to do more to 
teach people how to engage in 
those difficult conversations.”

Hudson said as a Black 

student at the Public Policy 
School, she often finds it 
difficult to separate her racial 
identity from her political 
beliefs. This is something she 
said her more privileged peers 
do not have to do.

“For me particularly, when 

I got to the policy school, it 
became really challenging to 
know when it was appropriate 
to bring my personal racial 
identities up when talking 
about 
policy 
and 
politics, 

because my outlook on life, 
my perspective on issues and 
policies that are enacted in 
our nation and the world, 
I look at those through the 
lens of my racial identity,” 
Hudson 
said. 
“Sometimes 

we’re encouraged to not mix 
the personal with political and 
it’s hard for me to be able to do 
that for myself, but also to be 
in classes where other people 
do have the privilege of being 
able to separate their personal 
from their political or policy 
beliefs.”

However, 
both 
Hudson 

and Brown cite Intergroup 
Relations 
Dialogues 
as 

“definitely 
comprehensive” 

in 
discussing 
problems 

surrounding 
race 
and 

ethnicity.

“It really required us to 

engage in very intentional 
conversations about race, and 
to look a little deeper than just 
racial climate, but systems and 
structures that created the 
racial climate and how your

through eBay to inform his 
research.

In attendance at the event 

was LSA senior Levi Teitel who 
said he learned new information 
about how widespread the 
popularity of blackface was at 
one point in American culture. 

“What struck me is how 

much is really ingrained in 
American mass culture and 
that (blackface) was always a 
popular force within it and not 
a marginal prejudice,” Teitel 
said.

LSA junior Nikola Jaksic, 

vice president of History Club, 
emphasized 
how 
Berrey’s 

presentation filled gaps in his 
own 
knowledge 
concerning 

blackface.

“I’ll be honest, I didn’t know 

how explicitly modern use 
of blackface is tied to these 
minstrel shows,” Berrey said. 

“It is unfortunate that we 
have to talk about these things 
specifically, but it is great that 
we have people like Professor 

Berrey who are knowledgeable 
and can facilitate a discussion 
about why these things are 
problematic, what we can do 
about them, and hopefully 
create a more informed student 
body.”

personal identities relate to the 
social climate,” Hudson said.

Engineering 
junior 
A.J. 

Ashman, 
who 
recently 
ran 

for 
president 
of 
Central 

Student 
Government 
under 

MomentUM, emphasized the 
Race and Ethnicity course is 
designed to help University 
graduates 
achieve 
cultural 

competency and inspire them 
to work to fix these issues after 
leaving the University.

“If our goal is to produce 

global 
citizens 
who 
are 

culturally competent in all 
kinds of things, we need to push 
that in our R&E classes and not 
have R&E classes that kind of 
touch on R&E but don’t really 
bring it forth,” Ashman said. 
“This really does serve a higher 
purpose 
than 
just 
another 

box on one student’s checklist 
before they graduate. This is 
about making students aware 
of injustices in our world, along 
the lines of race and ethnicity, 
and saying each of us have a role 
to play in fixing these issues. 
These issues should somewhat 
affect you. It shouldn’t be, ‘Oh 
that sucks.’ They should be a 
call to action.”

While Brown does not believe 

that better implementation of 
the requirement would cure 
racism like blackface, or people 
writing racist messages on the 
University rock, she does think 

it would be a “fantastic start.”

“We wouldn’t have to focus 

on 
the 
racist 
things, 
like 

blackface, or people writing 
on the rock, ‘F*** Latinos,’” 
Brown said. “We wouldn’t have 
these things if people were 
actually culturally competent 
and understood the complex 
histories of the people they 

mock and ridicule. I can’t say 
that the Race and Ethnicity 
requirement is a catch-all, but 
it would be a fantastic start to 
eliminating a lot of the racist 
problems on campus.”

with other students on a new Class 
and Inequalities Studies minor 
for about a year and a half. This 
minor would draw on courses 
from various departments across 
campus, but would be potentially 
housed 
within 
the 
Women’s 

Studies Department.

Schandevel 
said 
the 

Women’s Studies Department 
chair reached out to her letting 
her know of this decision made 
by the LSA CC.

“We thought initially there’s 

no use advancing this minor at 
this point, but I reached out to 
Angela Dillard,” Schandevel 
said. “I explained that we had 
been working on it for a year 
and a half.”

Next 
month, 
Schandevel 

said 
the 
minor 
will 
be 

presented in front of the full 
Women’s Studies faculty for 
their approval. With faculty 
approval, it would go to the 
LSA CC for approval.

According 
to 
the 
email 

sent out by Martin, the high 
number of LSA minors has 
made Registrar’s Office’s work 
more complicated.

“Academic majors required 

multiple 
layers 
of 
review, 

including accreditation by an 
external state agency,” Dillard 
wrote. “Minors do not; they are 
relatively unregulated.”

Dillard wrote the units sending 

proposals for new minors in the 
fall may still do so; however, the 
process for getting them approved 
will require considerably more 
time and consideration.

For certain programs, such 

as the Entrepreneurship minor, 
the area of study is offered only 
through its minor. Jeni Olney, 
academic program manager for 
the minor, said the roles minors 
play for students is unique.

“That’s the value that a minor 

adds to an undergraduate student 
experience … You can decide 
how you want to spend your 
time in terms of which major, 
but beyond that, you still have 
other interests and skills that you 
want to explore,” Olney said. “So, 
finding a minor that complements 
that is really what can enhance a 
student’s experience.”

Olney said Entrepreneurship 

is a program that will stay as a 
minor because it is intended to 
be applied to other disciplines 
students are engaged in.

Dillard also wrote the high 

number of minors has spurred 
questions about the nature of 
minors such as whether they 
should 
be 
interdisciplinary 

or the number of credits they 
should encompass.

“There is also the question of 

whether 111 minors is enough 
or too many,” Dillard wrote. 
“We’d like to have enough time 
and space to think through 
these questions.”

Public 
Health 
Junior 

Faith 
Reynolds 
expressed 

disappointment, 
stating 
she 

thinks academic ingenuity will be 
limited by this change. 

“It’s sad that LSA is considering 

stopping the creation of new 
minors because that leaves little 
room for growth and exploration 
of new academic horizons for 
both the students and faculty 
involved.”

Bennett 
explained 
why 

growing up in a low-income 
household has affected his life 
as a student.

“I 
come 
from 
a 
low 

socioeconomic status home,” 
Bennett said. “I was raised 
by a single mother, so I know 
what it is like to be raised in a 
household that lives on a week-
to-week paycheck.”

Rosof 
then 
shared 
his 

experience of growing up in a 
high-income environment, and 
why he chose to get involved in 
the Inclusive Campus Corps.

“Only once I got to college 

did I realize how privileged 
I was,” he said. “I joined this 
workshop to educate myself 
because I know I have made 
numerous 
mistakes 
in 
the 

past. I personally feel this is 
something that the University 
does not talk enough about.”

Bennett and Rosof then 

shared 
statistical 
data 
of 

University 
students 
which 

clearly displays the economic 
disparities 
within 
the 

University student body.

One of the pieces of data 

shared was the median family 
income of University families 
as $154,000.

Bennett 
continued, 

emphasizing the discrepancies 
in percentages of students at 
the University who are in the 
top 1 percent of family income 
and those who are in the 
bottom 60 percent.

“Students 
in 
and 
above 

the 1 percent are 9.3 percent 

of students and those in the 
bottom 60 percent are 16.5 
percent of students,” he said.

The 
participants 
were 

then separated into groups to 
discuss what being a low-SES 
student means and what the 
University can do to aid low-
SES students.

Public 
Policy 
junior 

Lauren 
Schandevel 
shared 

her 
definition 
of 
low 

socioeconomic 
status 
and 

explained how it means more 
than low income, but also a 
lack of opportunity.

“I think it is someone’s 

income relative to everyone 
else’s,” she said. “But I also 
know that it’s more than just 
income and also about access 
to opportunity.”

The 
presentation 
then 

transitioned to a series of guest 
presenters 
who 
explained 

their 
work 
on 
improving 

the economic disparities on 
campus.

LSA senior Micah Griggs, 

former 
Central 
Student 

Government vice president, 
shared her experience of being 
a member of CSG and how 
she has worked to develop 
the Leadership Engagement 
Scholarship.

“I ran to be a member of 

Central Student Government 
and once I was elected, I 
realized that I was the only 
Black girl in the organization 
and that it was a pretty 
homogenous group,” Griggs 
said. 
“When 
our 
first 

demographic 
report 
was 

published, it showed that the 
majority of our organization 
was white, male and upper 
middle class.”

She 
then 
continued 
to 

explain 
why 
economic 

disparities play a large role 
in allowing the homogeneity 
of CSG and other student 
organizations.

“There are barriers within 

student leadership,” she said. 
“When 
you’re 
involved 
in 

student organizations, you’re 
involved maybe five to 10 hours 
a week. Other students cannot 
spend that time because they 
are working and because they 
cannot afford to.”

Griggs also explained how 

the divides she experienced in 
CSG motivated the Leadership 
Engagement 
Scholarship, 

which was released on April 2, 
2018.

“These barriers are what 

led us to create the Leadership 
Engagement 
Scholarship,” 

she said. “This scholarship 
provides financial awards to 
emerging or established new 
leaders who are low-SES or 
facing some type of financial 
burden.”

Reginald 
Hammond 
Jr., 

the assistant director of the 
Kessler Presidential Scholars 
at the University, spoke about 
the different resources the 
scholarship office has like 
“Walk-in 
Wednesday” 
and 

peer tutoring.

“What we do is offer a 

drop-in period called ‘Walk-
in Wednesday’ and we invite 
students every week, whether 
it’s about income, social, or 
something else, to come and 
troubleshoot ideas with us so 
they can help us help them,” 
Hammond 
said. 
“We 
also 

have the peer mentor program 
which is our one way of really 

getting to know the students. 
What we want to do is to help 
them set goals.”

Schandevel, 
one 
of 
the 

authors of the “Being Not-
Rich at UM” Guide, explained 
why she decided to create this 
guide for low-SES students and 
why it is important that the 
issue of socioeconomic status 
is discussed since it often is an 
invisible identity.

“My 
document 
was 

in 
response 
to 
the 
CSG 

Affordability 
Guide, 
which 

had a lot of good information,” 
Schandevel said. “A lot of the 
criticism people had towards it 
was that it was geared towards 
all students on campus, and 
when you’re on a campus where 
66 percent of people are a part 
of the top 20 percent, you’re 
going to have something that 
doesn’t quite match the needs 
of lower income students.”

She continued to explain 

why she felt that a resource 
such as the “Being Not-Rich at 
UM” is necessary for low-SES 
students.

“This document is so people 

can identify others who have 
had other experiences and 
learn from them,” she said.

Engineering junior Lindsay 

Rasmussen 
explained 
why 

she felt having events that 
increase awareness of low-SES 
identities is important.

“It’s important to come to 

these events because a lot of 
people at this school do have 
privilege and making people 
more aware is a good first step 
in getting the ball rolling so we 
can improve things for low-
SES students on campus,” she 
said.

how 
marginalized 
groups 

must take extra care in the way 
they present themselves to the 
public due to societal stigmas 
— a repetitive cycle of actions 
which weighs heavily upon the 
individual forced to practice 
such vigilance. 

“That burden of not being 

seen as an individual but being 
just seen as a member of your 
race — I argue that that results 
in people of those marginalized 
groups, like Black Americans, 
having to be careful about what 
they say, be careful about how 
they dress and appear, and take 
care of where they go and how 
they socialize, and just kind of 
prepare themselves on a daily 
basis for things that might or 
might not happen,” she said. 
“And that’s what I call vigilance.”

Hicken said she studied the 

effects this type of vigilance 
can have on individuals and has 
found, particularly for Black 
women, this vigilance can lead 
to unhealthy eating habits and 
associated weight gain.

“I had been reading things 

on how obesity, especially the 
kind that is really related to poor 
health which is the kind around 
your waistline, the ‘apple shape,’ 
can be related to stress,” Hicken 
said. “So not only can chronic 
stress change your metabolism 
so you start to deposit fat around 

your organs, but then also 
that stress can result in eating 
behaviors, because what we call 
comfort foods that are high end 
in fat or sugar can release these 
chemicals in our brains that 
make us feel better. ”

Hicken said she focused her 

study on women because women 
are much more prone to weight 
gain and obesity based on stress 
according to her own research. 
She found that while white 
women also have to deal with 
discrimination rooted in sexism, 
they do not encounter forms of 
vigilance compounded by race 
and identity. 

“Discrimination 
might 
be 

important for Black women, but 
if we start to really account for 
vigilance, then that becomes 
what 
is 
important,” Hicken 

said. “On the other hand, for 
white women vigilance does 
not matter, it’s not related to 
health at all, and really it’s 
about discrimination, and the 
difference between these two is 
that vigilance is about the burden 
of your race, and discrimination 
is about this person was mean 
to me, or this person treated me 
unfairly in my day to day life, and 
that’s really the difference.”

Lindsey Burnside, a research 

associate at the Institute for 
Social 
Research, 
has 
been 

working 
with 
Hicken 
since 

she was undergraduate at the 
University.

“Individual 
effects 
of 

discrimination 
happen 
to 

everyone all the time,” Burnside 

said. “So someone could say 
something really bad to me, but 
if they don’t have any power to 
back it up then it doesn’t mean 
very much, whereas if someone 
that has power over me, then 
it has a lot more impact on my 
body and how I cope with the 
individual act, and then also 
what that means chronically, 
long term.”

Burnside said that while it 

is hard to think of ways we can 
fix the institutional racism that 
causes vigilance, it is still very 
important to confirm that this 
vigilance exists and that we 
must do something about it.

“It 
is 
meaningful 
to 

understand,” 
Burnside 
said. 

“And it is empowering as you 
are going through your life to 
be able to understand that there 
are reasons for the things that 
are happening to you, in ways 
that better equip individuals 
to actually cope, when you’re 
like, ‘No, this is not just me, no 
I am not being gaslighted about 
what’s happening to me.’ It helps 
to really understand why these 
things happen, and that you’re 
not alone in it, and that having 
coping responses is absolutely 
natural.”

Public 
Health 
Graduate 

student Alexis Stanton said 
she found the research she 
conducted with Hicken to be 
incredibly important, especially 
coming from a public health 
background.

“I think that in my work 

with Dr. Hicken, I’ve been able 

to think more deeply about the 
way that cultures and systems 
are often foundationally racist 
in many ways, and how that can 
perpetuate health inequities in 
marginalized 
communities,” 

Stanton said. “I think it’s really 
important work, and as someone 
who’s coming from public health 
I think we often think about 
issues like discrimination on a 
very interpersonal level, but I 
think that studying vigilance 
we think instead about the way 
culture and society perpetuates 
racist views an ideologies, and 
how that can really impact 
people’s health and well-being.”

Hicken 
stressed 
this 

phenomenon 
was 
the 
fault 

of society rather than any 
individual, and that it was 
something 
that 
needed 
to 

change.

“Once 
you 
start 
really 

understanding the systematic 
continuous unfair treatment of 
Black 
Americans 
throughout 

our history up until today, it’s 
astonishing, and heartbreaking, 
and my goal is to really start 
documenting that it’s not just 
coincidence, or it’s not just poor 
health behaviors,” Hicken said. 
“This is not about something that 
Black Americans are doing, this 
is about something that society 
is doing to Black Americans, and 
to other racialized groups as 
well.”

T

he 
instability 
in 
the 

White House deepened 
in the past two weeks 

with the firings of Secretary of 
State 
Rex 
Tillerson, 
National 

Security Advisor H.R. McMaster 
and Secretary of Veteran Affairs 
David Shulkin. Amid this string of 
high-profile departures, rumors 
circulated that President Donald 
Trump is considering firing special 
counsel Robert Mueller, whose 
investigation into the Russian 
interference in the 2016 election 
is reportedly zeroing in on senior 
Trump administration officials.

Trump 
lacks 
the 
direct 

authority to fire Mueller himself, 
as does Attorney General Jeff 
Sessions who recused himself 
from the Russia investigation last 
year. But Trump could orchestrate 
Mueller’s dismissal by ordering a 
top-ranking Justice Department 
official 
to 
fire 
Mueller, 
and 

firing those officials who refuse, 
until someone agrees. Such a 
sequence would be reminiscent 
of the notorious “Saturday Night 
Massacre” in the final year of 
Richard Nixon’s presidency, when 
Nixon forced the firing of the 
special prosecutor investigating 
the Watergate scandal.

If Trump follows in Nixon’s 

footsteps and fires Mueller, it will 
be time to discuss the “i-word.” Yes, 
impeachment. Many Democratic 
members 
of 
Congress 
have 

already 
called 
for 
Trump’s 

impeachment, but Democratic 
Congressional 
leaders 
have 

pushed back strongly against 
impeachment, 
and 
rightfully 

so. Trump has made many poor 
decisions in his short time as 
president, but none warranting 
impeachment. That changes if 
Trump decides to fire Mueller.

Trump has not tried to hide his 

disdain for Mueller’s investigation. 
He has repeatedly belittled the 
probe as a “witch hunt” and recently 
called for a new special prosecutor 
to scrutinize alleged bias at the 
Justice 
Department, 
including 

within Mueller’s investigation. The 
idea of a new special prosecutor to 
investigate the special counsel is 
every bit as ludicrous as it sounds, 
especially 
when 
considering 

Mueller’s hard-earned reputation 
for integrity and professionalism. 
On Saturday, Sessions declined to 
name a new special prosecutor, 
reigniting tension between Sessions 
and Trump.

Trump 
has 
long 
loathed 

Mueller’s investigation, but his 
irritation will likely only grow 
now that Mueller has subpoenaed 
The Trump Organization and is 
focusing in on Trump’s inner circle. 
In addition, Mueller’s face-to-face 
interview of Trump looms in the 
distance. With Trump’s growing 
animosity toward Mueller, Sessions 
and the Justice Department in 
general, 
it 
appears 
distinctly 

possible that Trump may move to 
fire Mueller, as he has long yearned 
to do.

Unlike 
cabinet 
secretaries 

and White House officials, special 
prosecutors do not serve at the 
pleasure of the president. Mueller 
can only be legally fired with 
just cause, and despite repeated 
attempts by many of the right 
wing to discredit his investigation, 
no such legitimate cause exists. 
Mueller is a distinguished attorney 
and a Bush-era former FBI Director 
(and a lifelong Republican). His 
sole loyalty is to the law, and the 
notion that his investigation is 
biased, as has been claimed by both 
right-wing pundits and politicians, 
simply doesn’t hold water.

Trump’s 
true 
motive 
to 

fire Mueller is clear: to end the 
investigation 
before 
it 
could 

uncover anything incriminating 
about his senior aides or himself. If 
Trump’s campaign did not collude, 
or conspire to collude, with Russia to 
win the election, then the president 
can rest assured that Mueller’s 
probe will vindicate him. This fact 
is what makes it so alarming, if not 
outright suspicious, that Trump is 
considering firing Mueller in the 
first place. Certainly, an unresolved 
special investigation is a political 
nuisance, but, as Trump’s advisors 
have surely told him, the political 
fallout would be far worse if 
Trump fired Mueller, raising again 
the question of why Trump would 
even consider doing so.

This speculation, though, is 

hardly a sufficient replacement 
for the concrete answers that 
Mueller’s 
probe 
promises 
to 

provide. 
Furthermore, 
with 

the way that the Congressional 
inquiries into Russian interference 
have 
gone, 
the 
Mueller 

investigation is likely the only 
one that will come to a reliable 
conclusion. The House Intelligence 
Committee’s 
investigation 

devolved into a partisan sham, 
with both parties issuing their 
own 
concluding 
reports 
last 

month. Later, Rep. Mike Conaway, 

R-Texas admitted to the media 
that the committee did not even 
try to fully investigate collusion. 
The Senate’s investigation, while 
still ongoing, has also run into 
partisan divisions.

The importance of Mueller’s 

investigation 
cannot 
be 

understated, as it is the only 
one 
capable 
of 
definitively 

determining whether Trump’s 
campaign colluded with Russia. 
This fact, coupled with the 
absence of a justifiable reason to 
terminate Mueller’s investigation, 
is why firing Mueller would 
amount to a clear case of 
obstruction of justice.

Impeachment is not a word 

that should be thrown around 
lightly, nor a political weapon 
to be used casually. But no one, 
including the president, is above 
the law. That principle has guided 
American politics since the Nixon 
era and will be tested if Trump 
decides to fire Mueller. Thus 
far, Trump has done nothing to 
warrant impeachment. He has 
committed (that we know of) no 
high crimes or misdemeanors. 
However, if Trump decides to fire 
Mueller, he will have obstructed 
justice, a grave offense and one 
worthy of impeachment.

Political realities are a delicate 

matter. Trump enjoys Republican 
majorities in both houses of 
Congress and could foreseeably 
dodge the natural consequences of 
firing a special prosecutor. While 
some Republicans have sharply 
warned Trump against doing 
so, others have joined Trump 
in 
criticizing 
Mueller 
and 

would likely rally to his side. 
But another political reality is 
that the president of the United 
States is under investigation 
for possibly colluding with 
a 
foreign 
government 
to 

influence his own election and 
is reportedly considering using 
his powers to prematurely 
end that investigation. This 
matter goes beyond everyday 
politics and extends to the 
integrity of our democratic 
institutions. Impeachment is 
not on the table right now, nor 
should it be. But should Trump 
fire 
Mueller, 
impeachment 

would be the appropriate and 
requisite response.

If Trump fires Mueller, time for the i-word

How to talk about climate change

HANNAH CONNORS, RACHEL SCHWAB, ALICIA VANDERPOOL, CHARLOTTE MASUCCI, JORDAN 
STONE | OP-ED

T

he 
University 
of 

Michigan has exceptional 
academics, 
athletics, 

alumni and more, but it is severely 
lacking in one area: providing 
mental health education and 
awareness 
of 
resources 
on 

campus. The University’s First 
Year Experience programs are 
excellent in providing freshmen 
with 
information 
on 
sexual 

assault, bystander intervention 
and the dangers of binge drinking. 
Yet, there is a dire need for 
something similar to fill the 
current void of mental health 
education and assist students 
in 
navigating 
an 
oftentimes 

confusing system.

Too many freshmen enter 

campus without the knowledge 
of where to access these resources 
and support in times of need not 
only in their first year but also 
throughout their entire college 
experience. With a mental health 
education component in freshman 
residence hall meetings equipping 
students with knowledge of both 
the resources available and how 
to best utilize them, many issues 
regarding 
mental 
health 
on 

campus would be alleviated.

According to the University’s 

Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services website over 57.7 million 
people suffer from the negative 
consequences of various mental 
health disorders and illnesses each 
year, and a 2002 study showed 
over 31,000 people act on these 
negative consequences, ending 

their lives via suicide. Based on 

our own experiences and those of 
our peers, we know many students 
suffering from these different 
disorders saw their mental health 
deteriorate 
after 
arriving 
on 

campus. More importantly, they 
were not adequately informed of 
the resources they had access to 

on campus to receive help.

We have seen, either through 

our own experiences or those of 
our friends, the ways in which 
mental illness can severely hurt 
one’s 
college 
experience. 
As 

the first in her family to attend 
college, a member of our group, 
Alicia Vanderpool, had no prior 
knowledge or preparation for 
how difficult college life would be. 
Three years later, she is just now 
becoming aware of the resources 
available to help treat her now 
diagnosed generalized anxiety 
disorder and major depressive 
disorder. However, because she 
has 
already 
developed 
these 

different mental disorders, it has 
become much harder to treat and 
is taking more of the University’s 
time and resources than it would 
have if she would’ve been treated 
much earlier on.

Another 
member, 
Hannah 

Connors, is a Wolverine Support 
Network leader and frequently 
refers 
students 
to 
campus 

resources they either did not know 
about or have trouble navigating. 
Throughout her three semesters 
as a leader, she has noticed the 
need to better educate students 
about the help available to them 
and knows there are thousands of 
students she has not met who may 
be struggling similarly.

Only 42 percent of students 

surveyed 
are 
aware 
of 
the 

Wellness 
Zone 
on 
Central 

Campus, 27 percent are aware 
of the CAPS embedded model 
and 17 percent are aware of “the 
Department of Psychiatry of 
Outpatient Clinics (including the 
Depression Center),” according to 
the Central Student Government 
Mental Health Taskforce report 
published last year. There are 
already enough barriers for 
students seeking help for their 

mental health, including general 
stigma and fear — confusion 
over resources should not add to 
the challenge.

To 
remedy 
this 
problem, 

a 
mental 
health 
education 

component should be included 
in all freshman residence hall 
meetings. It is a small enough 
setting that students are more 
likely to actively pay attention 
and retain information as this 
is a meeting almost all students 
already attend. Since 97 percent 
of first-year students live in 
University housing, it is one of the 
best places to relay information.

Implementing 
programming 

like this would likely call for the 
University to hire at least one 
new full-time staff member since 
thousands of first-year students 
live in University Housing and 
coordinating the mental health 
education 
component 
of 
so 

many meetings would be time-
intensive. While this presents an 
upfront cost to the University, a 
preventative measure like this one 
will decrease the overall trauma 
students 
experience 
through 

mental illness and will save the 
University time and money in the 
long run.

In

F

rom 
the 
increasing 

frequency and intensity of 
extreme weather events to 

rising sea levels, man-made climate 
change has already begun to bear 
environmentally-detrimental 
fruit. These trends jeopardize 
the environment and the human 
populations that they sustain. The 
effects of climate change, while 
often difficult to observe in a short 
period of time, will only continue 
to materialize unless significant 
steps are taken to curb its causes. 

Climate change — defined 

as the significant increase global 
temperatures 
since 
America’s 

industrial revolution — is mostly 
fueled by the incredible amounts 
of carbon dioxide pumped into the 
air by human consumption of fossil 
fuels, such as coal and petroleum 
products. It follows, then, that 
phasing out fossil fuels in favor of 
renewable energy sources, such 
as wind and solar power, will help 
curb this crisis before too much 
damage is done.

However, the acknowledgment 

of climate change’s effects and 
subsequent 
attitudes 
toward 

renewables have devolved from 
matters of scientific and accepted 
fact into divisive subjects of 
increasingly virulent political and 
cultural dispute. While a near-
consensus of scientists agree on 
the reality of climate change, 
current doubt among the public 
has persisted, largely due to 
the turnaround in conservative 
ideology in the last decade. 

This turnaround owes itself 

to a confluence of political factors, 
stemming 
from 
both 
special 

interests of certain conservative 
donors and a reaction to Barack 
Obama’s presidency. Amid the 
realization that renewables posed 
a serious threat to oil, industry 
executives launched a campaign 
to undermine the legitimacy of 
climate change, and the shift to 
renewables that it encouraged. 
These selfish business interests, 
along with lasting perceptions 
of President Obama’s legacy, 
surely 
approach 
conservative 

opinion on climate change more 
rationally than morally sectarian 
narratives do.

Should shifting conservative 

opinion back to environmental 
protection, 
then, 
rely 
on 

countering the effects of these 
political occurrences? Democrats 
do not seem to think so. So far, 
Democrats efforts have instead 
opted to repeatedly emphasize 

the science behind climate change 
and its negative impact on both the 
environment and people.

This tactic might work well for 

citizens that already lean left, but 
solely addressing the moral aspects 
of 
environmentalism 
neglects 

citizens 
predisposed 
against 

this point of view. Consequently, 
liberals have failed to win over any 
real converts—87 percent of self-
identified Republicans doubt the 
scientific consensus behind man-
made climate change, an opinion 
shown to be the “gateway” to 
supporting meaningful action on 
climate change. 

Winning 
non-

environmentalists back to the cause 
must occur soon before the effects 
of climate change become grossly 
irreparable. In order to succeed, 
the left must swiftly deviate 
from its current approaches and 
redress the factors that originally 
fueled 
conservative 
antipathy 

toward environmentalism.

The first of these factors, large 

injections of political money from 
fossil fuel interest groups, reflect 
an artificial distortion of the energy 
market away from renewables. 
Even though renewable sources 
of energy are inherently much 
more 
efficient 
than 
fossil 

fuels, they largely remain less 
economically viable than would 
be presumed due to subsidies for 
fossil fuel industries. 

This 
disparity 
continues 

in 
stark 
violation 
of 
free-

market values, leaving room for 
conservatives to cozy up to the 
idea of renewable energy use. The 
economic benefits of renewables 
are clear— improvements in solar 
and battery technology could 
slim average electricity costs by 
a factor of three. The significant 
consumer benefits conferred by 
embracing renewables illustrates 
the large role of economic values in 
resonating environmentalism with 
non-environmentalists. 

Just as important in reconciling 

acceptance of renewables with 
non-environmentalist ideology are 
the national security concerns of 
climate change. Looking at recent 
mass migrations out of Pakistan to 
the current water crisis in South 
Africa, it is blatantly obvious that 
climate abnormalities can fuel 
instability and uncertainty around 
the globe. 

Climate change specifically 

plays a key role in aggravating 
existing conflicts and dynamics, 
as has been already acknowledged 

by military officials, increasing the 
likelihood that American military 
insertion becomes necessary for 
stabilization. Given conservatives’ 
dedication to military service 
members and restraint in foreign 
military 
involvement, 
climate-

caused stresses should give any 
conservative American cause for 
real fear. 

Much as arguments centering 

on economic viability and national 
security 
would 
help 
reverse 

the 
environmental 
antipathy 

sparked by fossil fuel interest 
groups, 
conservatives’ 
distaste 

with the Obama administration’s 
handling of energy policy could 
be 
ameliorated 
with 
appeals 

to personal security interests. 
President 
Obama’s 
rollout 
of 

executive 
orders, 
directives 

and 
regulations 
centered 
on 

environmental reform inextricably 
tied environmental reform to the 
idea of extreme federal overreach 
for many Americans. 

What better to counter this 

sentiment 
than 
highlighting 

the 
increased 
self-sufficiency 

that 
accompanies 
renewable 

energy use? A shift away from 
power grid reliance would grant 
Americans the ability to power 
themselves independent of utility 
companies and the government. 
And, contrary to dismissals of 
renewables as less reliable than 
fossil fuels, encouragement of 
renewable energy use actually 
prompts energy production on a 
larger scale, bringing substantially 
decreased variation in collective 
energy output. Those pushing 
environmental initiatives would 
be 
wise 
to 
underscore 
how 

renewables, as reliable as they are 
pervasive, contribute to personal 
security interests.

In today’s political climate, 

it can be difficult to remember 
how 
effective 
environmental 

policy used to work. However, 
it is not enough for current 
environmentalists to reiterate the 
same calls to action, founded in 
the science, morality and sense 
of responsibility behind climate 
change. 
Effectively 
convincing 

entire populations of Republicans 
and non-environmentalists instead 
demands a tailored presentation 
founded on conservative ideology.

 The Weeknd is vulnerable 
on ‘My Dear Melancholy,’

ALBUM REVIEW

‘Flower’ is an underbaked 
try at a teen angst comedy 

“Flower” is like a Betty 

Crocker cake taken out of 
the oven 15 minutes too early 
— guiltily enticing, golden-
brown on the outside, but 
evidently inedible after the 
first cut. With a cast headlined 
by Zoey Duetch (“Everybody 
Wants 
Some!!”) 

and Adam Scott 
(“Parks 
and 

Recreation”), 
the film quickly 
loses its sheen as 
it 
devolves 
into 

one of the worst 
teen edge-fests in 
recent memory. It 
tries to shock the 
viewer into some 
Stockholm-syndrome-esque 
appreciation of an absolutely 
unlikable main character as 
she dances through her twisted 
antics 
to 
some 
forgettable 

radio-pop mix. It’s hollow 
entertainment.

The teen flick follows a 

crude and unusual 17-year-
old sexual extortionist Erica 
(Zoey Deutch) as she deals 
with her new, fresh-out-of-
rehab step-brother Luke (Joey 
Morgan, “Scout’s Guide to 
the Zombie Apocalypse”) in 
her own special way. They 
work together to take down a 
pedophile whose actions sent 

Luke into a downward spiral 
after 
middle 
school, 
their 

actions causing more harm 
than good and leading to a 
blooming but wholly unearned 
romance. 

The film’s most egregious 

issue is its audacity to expect 
empathy for a punishingly 
boring protagonist. Erica is 
written to be a wild, renegade 
teen who takes her town by 

the 
reins, 
not 

taking 
slack 

from 
anyone. 

This 
was 
not 

accomplished. 
On 
screen, 

Deutch tries way 
too hard to be 
edgy 
and 
just 

seems immature, 
which 
can 

sometimes be a 

fine trait in a main character 
if it is used as a touchstone to 
measure future growth (see 
“Rushmore”’s Max Fisher) but 
it doesn’t work here. Instead, 
Erica’s actions and responses 
to 
situations 
become 
too 

familiar too fast. She’s petulant 
and predictable, and she sours 
quickly.

“Flower” 
has 
primed 

some 
comparison 
to 
2018 

heavyweight “Three Billboards 
Outside 
Ebbing, 
Missouri,” 

as both follow a female lead 
who takes it upon herself to 
bring to justice child predators 
in their towns. In a way, it 

suffers from a similar problem. 
While these characters may 
be fighting for a perfectly 
moral and just cause, the way 
they accomplish their end goal 
matters. 
Granted, 
“Flower” 

doesn’t deserve to be in the 
same conversation, but there is 
some trend present. If actions 
of characters in a film were 
supposed to be just a means to 
an end, filmmakers would have 
resorted by now to showing 
found 
footage 
of 
liberated 

prisoners of war walking out 
of American airports and of 
children hugging chronically 
abused puppies as they leave 
humane society shelters. If 
the characters given are too 
unlikable, it doesn’t matter 
what they’re doing, it will still 
be a difficult movie to watch. 
In “Flower,” Erica doesn’t do 
enough to distance herself 
from the actions on screen. The 
movie attempts to humanize 
her 
through 
a 
few 
softer 

scenes toward the end, but 
as your father told you when 
you were losing that fourth 
grade travel basketball game 
by 18 points late in the second 
half: “you can’t get it all back 
on one trip down the floor.” 
“Flower” chucks it up from 
half-court a few times toward 
the end instead of creating 
well-rounded 
characters 

throughout, and just like in 
that basketball game, it doesn’t 
work.

FILM REVIEW

When The Weeknd released 

Starboy in 2016, he wanted 
to become a pop star. He 
shed his old R&B persona, 
cutting 
his 
signature 
hair 

and strangling his old self to 
death in the “Starboy” music 
video. He armed his album 
with A-list pop producers and 

buzzworthy features like Max 
Martin and Kendrick Lamar. 
His efforts paid off — Starboy 
placed several songs on the 
Billboard Top 40 and scored 
him 
another 
number 
one 

with the album’s title track. 
With frequent comparisons 
to Michael Jackson, it seemed 
like we had a new, darker 
Prince of Pop. But the release 
of My Dear Melancholy, almost 
two years later, indicates the 

old Weeknd survived. The EP 
is exactly what I’d expect after 
his reinvention: a mix of pop 
influences ingrained into the 
classic drug-induced R&B that 
jump-started his career.

Although 
his 
three 

mixtapes, 
which 
combined 

to 
make 
Trilogy, 
were 

groundbreaking 
in 
their 

hazy and electronic R&B, the 
lyrical themes grew repetitive 
over the course of three tapes. 
The Weeknd sings about sex 
and 
drugs 
without 
really 

specifying which drugs he’s 
using and which people he’s 
having sex with — at times, 
it can seem braggadocious 
and 
immature. 
However, 

with My Dear Melancholy, 
The 
Weeknd 
feels 
more 

intimate and authentic, like a 
personally addressed letter. 
Since stardom, The Weeknd 
has had two long-term and 
high-profile relationships: one 
with model Bella Hadid and 
another, more recent, stint 
with singer Selena Gomez. He’s 
had adult relationships and 
experienced real heartbreak. 
On 
“Wasted 
Times,” 
The 

Weeknd 
references 
two 

relationships, 
reflecting 
on 

the lost time spent with a past 
lover. The production borrows 
from Starboy, with its heavy 
snare and vocal distortion, 

while burying The Weeknd’s 
voice under synth layering 
and smoky vocals that made 
Trilogy so emotive.

On Melancholy, there’s also 

moments of new, vulnerable 
Weeknd. “Call Out My Name” 
— the opening and likely best 
track — finds The Weeknd 
exposed. 
With 
minimal 

production and a slow-burning 
intro, the track depicts The 
Weeknd begging a lover not 
to leave. The syllables of the 
chorus as he sings “Call out 
my name” are drawn out and 
imploring, shedding light on 
his wounded heart.

But, 
like 
other 
Weeknd 

projects, the EP is top heavy, 
trailing off towards the end. 
“Hurt You” sounds like the 
“Starboy” beat repurposed for 
the typical “I’m unemotional 
and sex-driven” Weeknd tune. 
“Privilege,” the closing track, 
builds well but climaxes on 
a forgettable chorus about a 
heartbreak-driven drug binge.

Despite a few lackluster 

tracks, My Dear Melancholy, 
is The Weeknd at his most 
vulnerable 
and 
genuine. 

Like the title, the project 
feels addressed to someone 
specific, allowing us third 
party listeners in on a private 
conversation with him and a 
lover.

In its fifth season ‘Silicon 
Valley’ is back in its groove

As someone who grew up 

in Silicon Valley, the HBO 
show 
of 
the 
same 
name 

always felt uncannily more 
like a documentary than a 
comedy. From the get go, 
“Silicon 
Valley” 
has 
been 

astute satire of the Valley, a 

place where obscene amounts 
of money and a somewhat 
overzealous 
sense 
of 
self-

importance produce a uniquely 
idiosyncratic 
environment. 

Ironically, the show has been 
enthusiastically 
embraced 

by the very demographic it 
relentlessly pokes fun at. Walk 
into any startup office or CS 
building at any university and 
you’ll find that our (speaking 
as 
an 
engineer) 
affinity 

towards the show’s humor is 
not entirely dissimilar to a 
12-year-old’s 
towards 
toilet 

humor. Guaranteed guffaws 
at popular sound bites such 
as “this guy fucks” or “middle 
out” illustrate how “Silicon 
Valley” has transcended into 
being a possibly niche, but still 
hilarious cultural icon.

Nonetheless, I was quite 

worried 
going 
into 
season 

five. Season four was easily 

SAYAN GHOSH
Daily Arts Writer

the 
series’s 
weakest, 
with 

Pied Piper going frustratingly 
nowhere during the course 
of 
the 
entire 
season 
and 

Richard Hendricks (Thomas 
Middleditch, 
“Kong: 
Skull 

Island”) going from lovable 
awkward nerd into a character 
that was at too many points 
simply painful to watch. The 
satire still had its edge, but it 
seemed like the show’s magic 
was just about running out. 
Was the show just overstaying 
its welcome?

Thankfully, the beginning of 

season five has me cautiously 
optimistic. We find the team 
without Erlich Bachmann (T.J. 
Miller, “Deadpool”) for the 
first time after a disappearance 
in Tibet, and although Erlich 
is one of the show’s most 
notable characters, I wasn’t 
quite miffed by his departure. 
By the end of season four, he 
was just a cheap source of 
crude humor, a deadbeat who 
had little relevance to the plot 
or progress of Pied Piper. It 
turned out that T.J. Miller in 
real life was becoming a bit 
too much like the character he 
played, forcing the writers to 
strand him in the mountains. 
Oh well. Anyway, season five 
sees the group move into a 

new office, and throughout 
the course of the first few 
episodes, 
welcome 
a 
large 

group of engineers.

And to that I say: finally! 

Pied Piper is finally actually 
making some progress. One 
of the aspects of season four 
that was so frustrating was 
the feeling that the show 
didn’t have to be quite so 
cyclical. The possibilities for 
conflict 
and 
comedy 
with 

a larger team as Pied Piper 
expands are limitless. While 
Richard 
is 
still 
hopelessly 

unfit as a motivator and CEO 
(an early scene has him give 
a ridiculously cringeworthy 
speech to his new employees), 
he shows glimpses of a Silicon 
Valley staple many viewers of 
the show are expecting to pan 
out: the transformation from 
being a brilliant, dopey coder 
to a ruthless businessman, aka 
Hooli CEO Gavin Belson (Matt 
Ross, “Captain Fantastic”).

Belson is brilliant as ever, 

with a renewed zeal to destroy 
the upstart Pied Piper. The 
show continues to excel at 
his characterization as well 
as incorporating new gags, 
including a recurring bit that 
involves three new coders the 
team dubs “stallions, each one 
more magnificent than the 
last.” Each time the stallions 
are 
mentioned, 
sentimental 

music plays while the camera 
pans 
to 
three 
disheveled 

engineers 
rubbing 
their 

eyes while squinting at their 
laptops. While Dinesh (Kumail 
Nanjiani, 
“The 
Big 
Sick”) 

and Guilfoyle (Martin Starr, 
“Spider Man: Homecoming”) 
have not developed as much as 
I would like, their interactions 
are as snide and petty as ever, 

and characters such as Laurie 
Breem (Suzanne Cryer, “The 
Cloverfield Paradox”) remain 
as perfect imitations of some 
of 
Silicon 
Valley’s 
more 

unusual personalities. Jared 
(Zach Woods, “The Post”), one 
of the show’s most intriguing 
characters, continues to drop 
some truly disturbing lines 
which lead me to think he grew 
up in a weird cultist/Neo-Nazi 
family.

Meanwhile 
in 
Erlich’s 

absence, Jian Yang (Jimmy O. 
Yang, “Crazy Rich Asians”) 
takes over and hatches a plot 
to “inherit” his wealth. While 
Jian Yang is hilarious in short 
bursts, it is worrying that 
the show has set him up to 
potentially be a main villain of 
sorts. At the moment, he still 
feels stuck as a caricature.

“Silicon Valley” is back, 

sort of. Early on, season five 
is 
encouraging, 
actually 

stimulating the idea that Pied 
Piper will grow and encounter 
a 
new 
set 
of 
problems. 

However, as I stated before, I 
remain cautiously optimistic.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Why 
is 
the 
concept 
of 

a 
powerful 
and 
talented 

female athlete still revered as 
something 
unexpected 
and 

revolutionary? It’s 2018. Women 
have 
been 
competing 
and 

dominating in predominantly 
male sports for years, yet the 
cinematic world is still inclined 
to exhaust the tale 
of the female who 
“proved herself” 
by competing like 
“one of the boys.” 
Netflix’s 
new 

“First Match” fits 
this archetype in 
its entirety and holds no real 
flavor, other than that which it 
has sucked from predecessor 
flicks within the wrestling, 
boxing 
and 
troubled-youth 

subgenres. 

In “First Match,” aggressive 

and hardened Monique (Elvire 
Emanuelle, “Rock of Ages”) is 
an aimless teen with an attitude 
problem, stuck in foster care. 
After discovering her father, a 
former high school wrestling 
champ, has been released from 
prison, she joins her school’s 
wrestling 
team. 
However, 

balancing her new commitment 
to the sport with her aim to 
impress and gain validation 
from her father, who reveals 
himself to be a shadier and 
shadier figure by the minute, 
proves far more complicated 
than 
Monique 
could 
have 

imagined. 

Interspersing 
sequences 

of 
Monique 
training 
for 

competitions 
on 
her 
high 

school team and rekindling her 
teetering relationship with her 
father, the rhythm of the film is 
lost. In one moment, audiences 
are rooting for Monique on 
the wrestling mat, yet in the 
next, we are onlookers to a 
poorly-scripted 
conversation 

between 
Monique 
and 
her 

father. Basically, the whole of 

the film consists 
of 
ever-so-

slightly modified 
variations of these 
two 
sequences, 

failing to deliver 
the 
one-two 

punch needed to 

keep viewers engaged. 

More frustrating, however, is 

the negative stereotype of Black 
women that is perpetuated 
through Monique’s rudeness 
and overall “fight-me” attitude. 
In one sequence during the 
beginning of the film, a girl at 
school makes a snide comment 
about 
Monique’s 
joining 

the wrestling team, causing 
Monique to lash out, grabbing 
the girl by the hair and initiating 
a physical brawl. Though the 
film’s intention is to show 
that Monique’s hostility is — 
surprise, surprise — prompted 
by her difficult past, Monique 
embodies the misconceptions 
that society has about Black 
women being loud, hotheaded 
and willing to go off on whoever 
tests them. 

Though 
not 
enough 
to 

redeem the film’s shortcomings, 

the bond between Monique 
and her foster mother Lucila 
(Kim Ramirez, “Nerve”) serves 
as one of the more intriguing 
elements. 
Divided 
by 
both 

barriers 
of 
language 
and 

Monique’s clear lack of desire 
for any sort of relationship, 
interactions shared by Lucila 
and Monique are exclusively 
negative for the majority of the 
movie. Subtly, however, their 
relationship eventually begins 
to grow. Lucila does not bleed 
into the role of the relentlessly 
doting foster mother, unphased 
by 
Monique’s 
hostility, 
as 

one might expect. In fact, the 
dislike between Lucila and 
Monique is clearly mutual, 
which feels much more realistic 
and, by extension, unexpected 
among the consistency of cliché 
throughout the film. 

The greatest weakness with 

“First Match” is that it knows 
exactly what it wants to be. 
Feeding from both worn-out 
storylines of the rough-around-
the-edges foster teen and of the 
tenacious girl proving herself 
in a male sport, the filmmakers 
of “First Match” mistake the 
combination 
of 
these 
two 

conventions 
as 
somehow 

sufficient to fabricate a feeling 
of 
inventiveness. 
However, 

women pushing the boundaries 
in the athletic world is hardly 
a fresh topic. Without adding 
its own distinctive twist on an 
already 
overused 
narrative, 

“First 
Match” 
struggles 
to 

pin down audience members, 
who quickly tire of the film’s 
predictability.

BOOK REVIEW

“At his table, my dead father 

sat in the green sleeveless jacket 
with orange on the inside. Or now 
and then the jacket was reversed, 
depending on whether he was 
hunting me or hiding.”

— David Keplinger, 
“Embarrassment”

“Another City: Poems,” by 

David 
Keplinger, 
constructs 

worlds with fewer lines than 
you’d believe, deftly painting 
pictures 
with 
thin, 
precise 

brushstrokes. The slim collection 
is an even mix of prose, poems 
and more stylized verses that 
depend on their enjambment 
and 
deliberate 
spacings 
to 

convey their point. Themes are 
varied but matching. Some of 
the prose poems — “My Town” 
in particular — sound almost 
like a mix between Mitch Albom 
and Thornton Wilder. Some tell 
stories of the narrator’s father, 
simultaneously 
introspective, 

detached and whimsical.

Many of the works easily 

capture the point of view of a 

child, slipping into dialectical and 
observational patterns that evoke 
both nostalgia and protective 
tenderness, while others convey 
the peculiarities of being or 
wanting to be a parent — or acting 
in a way that a parent does. The 

arc of giving in “Citizen Small,” 
in which the narrator used to 
crumple 
in 
feigned 
surprise 

for laughs, gracefully unfolds 
downward, until the speaker is 
left unable to pick himself easily 
back up (perhaps a pointed 
metaphor, vaguely reminiscent of 
“The Giving Tree,” but a beautiful 
piece nonetheless).

The best poems in “Another 

City” 
are 
reminiscent 
of 

snapshots. “City of Youth” distills 
all of the salient sentiments that 
come from holding the edges of 
an old photograph, peering into 

faces that can no longer peer 
back. “Wave” imagines a moment 
of Abraham Lincoln’s journey 
on a train, leaving Springfield in 
1861, a sepia-toned image deftly 
painted with but a few carefully 
designed brushstrokes. Another 
poem, “A Young Man’s Copybook: 
1861-1864” (and the following 
few) is written after the journal 
of his great-great-grandfather, 
who 
fought 
for 
the 
Union 

Pennsylvania Volunteers and was 
later incarcerated for desertion 
after his discharge papers were 
stolen. The melding of historical 
snippets 
and 
imagination 
is 

cleverly and sensitively done. 
“V-Sign” offers a surprisingly 
congruent relationship between 
the crumpled stockings on the 
ground, and birds in the sky. 
“Marie 
Curie’s 
Century-Old 

Radioactive 
Notebook 
Still 

Requires a Lead Box” is a tribute 
to the scientist’s passion for her 
work.

The beauty in “Another City” 

is subtle; crystal-clear images 
shine out from a muted color 
palette of material. Keplinger’s 
voice is perhaps above all musing, 
appraising pain, decadence and 
loss with an unclouded eye.

‘Another City: Poems’ is a

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

Art is a really weird thing 

to me. I’m not really sure how 
to explicitly define it besides 
saying that it’s any form of 
creative expression — but even 
that 
seems 
extraordinarily 

vague. I don’t claim to know 
a lot about art, or how to be 
an accomplished artist in any 
way whatsoever. However, one 
sort of epiphany I’ve had over 
the past few months about art 
is that all art, no matter the 
medium, is not perfect in any 
sense of the word, and there 
will never be a piece of art that 
is.

I have so many friends who 

pursue creative interests of 
a wide variety here in Ann 
Arbor. 
From 
painters 
to 

dancers, classical musicians 
to performance artists, I think 
I’ve had a glimpse into the 
world of an extensive range of 
artists. Something I’ve noticed 
about the work that really 
takes my breath away is that 
it doesn’t strive to be perfect. 
Too often the descriptions 
of 
artist 
and 
perfectionist 

become 
synonymous, 
and 

this is a stigma that I think is 
extremely toxic to the creative 
mindset. Art should be fueled 
by creativity, not perfection. 
If you have an impossible 
idea, see it through in any way 
you can, regardless of how 
achievable you think it is.

Over the summer, a few of 

my friends started a project 
called The Bada-Ba-Ba-Ba’s, 
an endeavor that encouraged 
those who chose to participate 
to 
experiment 
and 
make 

purposefully 
“bad” 
songs. 

It was a really interesting 
concept based loosely off of the 
sound of the female-fronted, 
outsider garage rock group The 

Shaggs, but the idea actually 
proved to be quite freeing. I 
participated in a few of these 
projects and actually really 
enjoyed myself. We made songs 
about really wacky topics in as 
little as five minutes. There 

was no re-recording. There 
was no writing. It was all about 
putting down whatever ideas 
came to you as fast as they 
came, without worrying about 
the quality of these ideas.

Ideas are debatably one of 

the most important resources 
to an artist, but they shouldn’t 
be treated as such. Ideas are 
cheap and malleable. It may 
not be important for you to 
carry out an idea exactly as 
you imagined it, but what does 
matter is that you follow it to 
some point of completion, even 
if it’s not what you originally 
thought. 
Nothing 
is 
going 

to come out exactly as you 
imagine it to, and that’s half 
the fun. If you have an idea, 

do what you can to make it 
a reality, and see what the 
outcome is.

In the past, I’ve talked 

about how Ann Arbor’s D.I.Y. 
and house-show scene has 
influenced me and the way 
I think about creativity and 
art, but I don’t think I can 
stress 
how 
important 
this 

mindset is for an artist. My 
housemate and I have, for a 
while, really enjoyed staying 
in on a Saturday night and 
just hanging out and listening 
to music, and sometimes that 
music includes — wait for it 
— showtunes. We had joked 
around a lot about putting on 
a two-man musical, but what 
was stopping us from actually 
putting one on?

So, we got some songs 

together, found a few props, 
created a Facebook event and 
started 
transforming 
our 

living room into a theater. We 
had everything planned out, 
and even though we didn’t 
have an orchestra or a stage, 
we put on a show for about 50 
people in our living room. The 
only thing stopping us from 
putting on a musical in our 
house was the possibility of a 
noise complaint. We wanted 
to do a musical, so we took 
what we had and we put one 
on ourselves. Was it the same 
quality as a production put on 
by 
Broadway 
professionals? 

Holy moly, no. But it was an 
idea we had, and after a few 
weeks of planning, we did 
what we could to put it on.

Striving 
for 
perfection 

will get you nowhere, and 
although I feel hypocritical 
for saying that (the amount of 
unfinished demos I have on my 
computer is pretty sad), what 
really matters is creating, no 
matter how subjectively good 
you think it is. The point of 
art is to create, not to achieve 
perfection.

quest to make perfect art

Wolverines sweep Delaware with Franklin homer

As the Michigan baseball team 

clung to a 3-2 lead over Delaware 
in the bottom of the eighth 
inning, 
junior 
center 
fielder 

Jonathan Engelmann stepped up 
to the plate and delivered a rocket 
up the middle to get on base. With 
lectures about the importance 
of creative baserunning surely 
floating 
through 
his 
mind, 

Engelmann overzealously took 
off toward second base. But his 
efforts would crash and burn, as 
the Blue Hen catcher launched 
the ball to the second baseman 
for an easy tag-out.

Junior third baseman Blake 

Nelson then grounded into the 
second out. After a promising 
start, 
the 
Wolverines 
found 

themselves facing a two-out, 
bases-empty situation.

Enter freshman slugger Jesse 

Franklin.

After 
Engelmann’s 

baserunning error and Nelson’s 
groundout, expectations were 
low for the first baseman. But 
Franklin shocked the crowd at 
Ray Fisher Stadium by cranking a 
shot to deep left field.

The ball flew over the wall, 

and 
the 
Wolverines 
poured 

out of the dugout to celebrate 
the impressive shot. Franklin 
rounded the bases, triumphantly 
stomped on home plate and was 
quickly mobbed by his gleeful 
teammates.

The solo bomb gave Michigan 

(16-11 overall, 3-0 Big Ten) a vital 
insurance run, effectively sealing 
a 4-2 win over Delaware (13-12).

“I just got a good fastball over 

the middle of the plate,” Franklin 
said. “Coach (Nick) Schnabel has 
been trying to give me tips to go 
the other way, and I’m just glad it 
went over the wall.”

Even before Franklin’s blast 

over the left wall, the Wolverines 
had a prolific day at the plate, 
amassing ten hits in the contest.

But those hits didn’t translate 

into as many runs as Michigan 
would have liked. The team 

was 
plagued 
by 
ineffective 

baserunning the whole day. Five 
runners were thrown out while 
trying to take additional bases, 
and the Wolverines stole just two 
bases despite their numerous 
attempts.

Despite a disastrous day on the 

basepaths, Michigan’s incessant 
desire to nab additional bases has 
paid dividends in the past and 
allowed the team to consistently 
compete.

“Today was probably our worst 

day baserunning-wise,” Franklin 
said. “We had a bad day today, 
but on Friday our baserunning 
won us the game and we were 
just going around and around and 
around. We talk a lot about extra 
90s and how it changes a game.”

Added coach Erik Bakich: “It’s 

just a mindset thing. Just wanting 
to get on base and go. We don’t 
want to be tethered to the base, 
we wanna get to scoring position. 
The more you can advance 90 
feet, the more chances you have 
to score runs. So again, we’re not 
a power hitting team, it’s nice 
to get an occasional home run, 
but we’re a manufacture type of 
offense.”

On the defensive side of things, 

though, the Wolverines were 
rock-solid. 
Sophomore 
right-

hander Karl Kauffman gave 
Michigan a solid performance, 
tossing six innings and allowing 
two runs, only one of them 
earned. Kauffman’s outing was 
supplemented by a combined 
three 
sound 
innings 
from 

freshman 
right-hander 
Jeff 

Criswell and junior left-hander 
Will Tribucher.

Criswell was cool and collected 

in his two innings of relief. In the 
eighth inning, Criswell found 
himself on the mound with the 
bases loaded but stepped up and 
sent the Blue Hens back to their 
dugout with their tails tucked 
between their legs.

“My approach there was just 

stay calm,” Criswell said. “Take 
deep breaths, just realize that if I 
can make a good pitch, somebody 
around me will pick me up and 
make a good play like they did 
today.”

Supporting Criswell in his 

showcase was the athleticism and 
ferocity of the Wolverine defense, 
which was in was in full display 
in the top of the seventh inning.

The first batter Criswell faced 

hit a bomb to deep left field, and 
the ball bounced off the wall 
where freshman Jordan Nwogu 
collected it and launched it to 
second base. The throw was just 
in time, and Michigan collected 
the out.

“It fired me up for sure,” 

Criswell said. “Seeing a guy like 
that make an incredible play just 
kind of lit a little bit of a fire in 
my stomach and kinda let me just 
go get the next two for the rest of 
the guys. It was an incredible play 
and props to him, it was a really 
good throw.”

With 
the 
win, 
Michigan 

extended its winning streak 
to 12 games, marking a drastic 
turnaround from a disappointing 
4-11 start to the season.

“We don’t ever want to go back 

to that rollercoaster of not only 
emotions, but of inconsistent 
play,” Bakich said. “It just feels 
different now because of the 
mindset the guys have. So, all the 
credit goes to them. Recognizing 
that their mindset needed to be 
better and then doing something 
about it and sustaining it to get 
the team hot.”

In a pressure-cooker event, 

Indiana came close to snapping 
the Michigan women’s water 
polo 
team’s 
15-game 
win 

streak.

The 
ninth-ranked 

Wolverines (1-0 CWPA, 23-7) 
added another victory to their 
ongoing 16 game win streak. 
The 9-7 win against No. 13 
Indiana (1-2, 20-6) awarded 
head coach Marcelo Leonardi 
his 
100th 

victory 
at 

Michigan.

On 
Senior 

Night 
at 

Indiana, 
electricity 
was in the air 
as the match 
against 
the 

Hoosiers 
was 
highly 

anticipated 
for both sides. 
Michigan was looking to win 
its 18th straight conference 
opener 
and 
continue 
its 

winning record.

“It was an environment 

where everyone was super 
pumped up,” said freshman 
utility player Maddy Johnston. 
“They had their band there, as 
well. We knew that we had to 
talk to each other because you 
can’t hear the coaches on the 
bench.”

The Wolverines started out 

strong by gaining possession 
during 
the 
initial 
sprint. 

Within the first two minutes 
of the match, Johnston posted 
her opponent and was open 
near 
center 
cage. 
Junior 

Julia Sellers recognized the 
opportunity and dished a lob 
pass that landed a perfect 
arm-distance grasp in front of 
Sellers. Johnston whipped the 
ball towards the corner of the 

cage and put Michigan on the 
board.

The two teams continued 

to trade goals throughout the 
second and third quarter. But 
the Wolverines’ momentum 
began to pick up.

With the score tied at 5 

and one minute remaining, 
Indiana’s 
Juli 
Hilovsky 

committed a penalty — giving 
the Wolverines with a six-on-
five opportunity. Junior driver 
Kim Johnson spotted an open 
look and assisted on senior 

attacker Caroline 
Anderson 
and 

tossed 
her 
the 

ball 
awarding 

Michigan 
with 

a 
1-point 
lead 

going 
into 
the 

final quarter.

The 

Wolverines never 
looked 
back. 

Several 
more 

power plays by 
Michigan 
and 

a few more missed shots by 
Indiana gave the Wolverines 
their well-deserved victory.

Though 
the 
16-game 

win streak itself calls for 
celebration, the coaching staff 
and players still believe the 
team needs to clean up some 
aspects of their game.

“We try to break down 

teams,” Johnston said. “We 
need to learn to be patient in 
our offense and learn to strike 
at the right time.”

However, 
the 
winning 

streak does not seem to be 
in jeopardy due to strong 
leadership and a drive for even 
greater play.

“We have strong leaders 

on our team so we always 
talk a lot,” Johnston said. 
“There is never too much 
communication. It helps with 
getting everyone on the same 
page.”

Michigan notches sixth straight victory

For weeks, it has been the same 

story. The Michigan women’s 
tennis team has struggled in its 
non-conference 
schedule, 
but 

turned its season around for Big 
Ten opponents. And while the 
Wolverines picked up two more 
conference wins this weekend, the 
story finally changed.

It wasn’t just the big hitters and 

the higher-ranked players doing all 
the work this time — the rest of the 
lineup has finally caught up.

Michigan faced rival Ohio State 

on Friday and Penn State on Sunday, 
and while the matchup with the 
Buckeyes proved to be tougher than 
matches against the Nittany Lions, 
the Wolverines walked away with 
4-3 and 7-0 victories, respectively.

For the past two seasons, every 

time Michigan has played Ohio 
State, it was considered a non-
conference match. And for the past 
two seasons, the Wolverines lost 

to the Buckeyes, yet won the Big 
Ten. Some might say those Big Ten 
Championships don’t really count, 
but if the Wolverines were to go on 
and win the Big Ten this year, there 
wouldn’t be anything left to say.

“Last year they were clearly the 

better team,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. “We struggled 
against them. Every year’s a new 
year and it was definitely good to go 
in there and pull that one out.

“… Every time we play Ohio State 

it’s a huge rivalry, and we were 
excited to get through.”

After dropping the doubles point 

and two of the first three singles 
matches off the court, Michigan 
was in a 3-1 hole. A three-set win 
from sophomore Chiara Lommer 
at No. 3 singles trimmed the deficit 
to one, but there was still plenty of 
work to be done.

Senior 
Mira 
Ruder-Hook 

and freshman Bella Lorenzini 
remained on court at No. 5 and No. 
6 singles — if either lost, it would 
seal the match for Ohio State.

Ruder-Hook managed to claw 

out a 6-0, 5-7, 6-2 victory of her 
own, leaving the team’s fate in 
Lorenzini’s hands. Her match was 
tightly contested for its entirety, as 
she took the first set in a tiebreaker 
and was down 5-4 in the second 
set. As much as Mary Beth Hurley 
tried to force a third set and keep 
the Buckeyes alive, Lorenzini won 
three straight games to take the 
second set, 7-5, to give her team the 
victory.

When the Wolverines struggled 

early in the season, the pressure 
often fell on junior Kate Fahey at 
the top of the lineup. The team 
could typically rely on her to get a 
point, but couldn’t produce points 
down the rest of the lineup. But the 
opposite was true of both Friday 
and Sunday’s matches, where 
after Fahey dropped her match, 
Michigan’s other singles players 
came in clutch.

That came in play during 

Sunday’s match as well. Due to 
Penn State having just four courts, 

not all the singles matches were 
played at once. No. 3 through No. 
6 went out first, and with four 
wins on four courts, the match was 
clinched before Fahey and the top 
of the lineup even got the chance 
to play.

“I think we’re getting more 

confidence as a group,” Bernstein 
said. “Three through six pulled 
through on Friday night and today 
we had three through six on to start 
the match. So I think everyone’s 
feeling confident and that’s what 
you want to do. As the season goes 
on, I mean we’re getting to April 
now, and you want to be playing 
with some confidence.

“We’ve definitely turned it 

around, which is good.”

The bottom of the lineup is 

finding its form just in time for the 
conference schedule to conclude 
and championship season to begin. 
With six straight wins and an 
unbeaten record in the Big Ten, 
Michigan’s early season woes seem 
to be a distant memory.

Freshman Bella Lorenzini helped the Michigan women’s tennis team earn two conference wins over Ohio State and Penn State this past weekend.

MEN’S GYMNASTICS
Michigan tops No. 18 UIC

On Senior Night, freshmen 

Jacob Moore and Cameron Bock 
delivered 
top 
performances, 

leading the Wolverines to a 
417.700-366.500 win against No. 
18 UIC.

After honoring the graduating 

team members, Michigan began 
the competition on floor routine. 
Moore — ranked third in the 
nation on floor — carried out a 
dominant performance, scoring 
14.900 to nearly match his 
personal best. Following Moore, 
junior Emyre Cole performed a 
clean 
routine, 

sticking all five 
of his passes 
and 
scoring 

14.350.

Following 

their 
strong 

show 
on 
the 

floor, 
the 

Wolverines 
wavered 
a 

little 
with 
a 

shaky pommel 
horse 
routine. 

Freshman 
Cameron 
Bock 

struggled with his form, but 
remained on the horse without 
falling — a remarkable feat in 
itself, according to coach Kurt 
Golder.

“It’s just pure strength and 

determination 
that 
he 
kept 

going,” Golder said. “And he did 
a real good job of recovering from 
it, because it was a big mistake.”

Despite those mistakes by Bock 

and sophomore Mack Lasker 
on pommel horse, Michigan 
maintained a 138.100-117.650 lead 
after the second rotation.

The seniors led the lineup on 

still rings. Tristian Perez-Rivera 
built momentum by performing 
two strong and stable iron crosses 
on his way to a score of 13.450. 
Dmitri Belanovski followed with 
a score of 13.650, and freshman 
James Read anchored the rings, 
scoring 14.300.

“He just really turned it on 

maybe a month ago,” Golding said 
of Read. “We decided to pull his 
redshirt, and right now I’m real 
glad we did that.”

Michigan continued onto vault 

where Cole impressed the judges 
with a strong Yurchenko earning 
a 14.500 mark.

On 
parallel 
bars, 
Bock 

delivered a confident showing 
with 
a 
double-pike 
before 

sticking 
the 
dismount. 
The 

judges scored Bock’s routine at 
14.600. Belanovski also delivered 
a notable routine with a score of 
13.950.

Redshirt junior Alec Krystek 

led the lineup on high bar. 

Krystek struggled 
to 
execute 
his 

routine as he fell 
off the bar during a 
straddle Tkachev. 
While they started 
with 
a 
sub-par 

performance, 
the 
Wolverines 

stayed 
focused 

as Bock finished 
strong with two 
Tkachevs in his 
routine and stuck 

a full twisting double layout 
dismount.

The Wolverines finished the 

meet ahead of the Flames. Bock 
was recognized for both his effort 
and skill by breaking the school 
record in parallel bars, high bar 
and all around. Belanovski also 
finished with a season best on high 
bar with a 9.300 on execution, and 
14.350 overall.

“A little more confidence,” 

Belanovski said, “made it a little 
more safe, and focused on hitting 
that execution score.”

For Michigan, the theme of 

the meet was confidence and 
consistency.

Although 
there 
were 
a 

few noticeable mistakes, the 
Wolverines seem certain that they 
can iron out the kinks before the 
Big Ten Championship next week.

“I think we have a great 

chance,” Belanovski said. “And 
we’re ready to bring it home.”

Lavigne’s solid play exemplifies Michigan’s run

I

t all began with Hayden Lavi-
gne.

Before Michigan’s 14-6-

1 record since New Year’s Day, 
before it reached the 25th Frozen 
Four in 
program 
history, there 
was the 
sophomore, 
starting in 
goal against 
Michigan 
State in the 
Great Lakes 
Invitational.

Lavigne 

wasn’t terrific, allowing four 
goals. But he did enough for the 
Wolverines to win, and enough 
to earn a start against No. 1 Notre 
Dame three days later.

Despite compiling a .937 save 

percentage over the course of the 
series, Lavigne couldn’t save his 
team from being swept. But he did 
enough to assert himself as the 
unquestioned starter heading into 
Michigan’s most crucial series of 
the season at Minnesota.

Against the Golden Gophers, 

Lavigne wasn’t exactly the second 
coming of Marty Turco. But once 
again, he did enough — stopping 
41 of 45 shots on the weekend — 
and the Wolverines returned to 
Ann Arbor with two massive wins 
under their belt.

The turning point in Michigan’s 

season wasn’t the product of some 
miracle pill. Nothing was radically 
different from October, November 
or December. Everything — 
offense, defense, special teams — 
was just a little bit stronger, a little 
bit more solid, a little bit more 
stable.

Ask coach Mel Pearson or any 

of his players why the Wolverines 
started to roll, and they’ll talk 
about what you’d expect.

They’ll talk about consistency. 

They’ll talk about confidence. 
Then they’ll talk about Lavigne.

“(The Notre Dame series) 

was our first weekend where we 
played two really solid games,” 

said sophomore forward Jake 
Slaker last week. “Even though we 
lost, we were really happy with 
our game. … Hayden Lavigne was 
kind of the starter of that.”

And not only was Lavigne 

the starter of that, he’s also 
epitomized it.

Pearson has compared 

Michigan’s surge to a snowball 
making its way down a hill; 
growing and growing as 
it continues to roll. It’s an 
effective metaphor for Lavigne’s 
own development — gaining 
experience and confidence with 
every save and every game.

“I’ve been able to string 

together four pretty solid games 
back-to-back,” Lavigne said on 
Jan. 18. “That in itself leads to a 
little more confidence where I’ve 
found myself playing a little bit 

farther out, little bit more sure of 
the plays I’m making in net.”

The next day, he made 35 

saves against Penn State to blank 
the highest-scoring team in the 
nation.

For an encore one night later, 

he stopped 43 of 45 shots — 
frequently doing so in spectacular 
fashion — and prompted the 
Nittany Lions’ official Twitter 
account to desperately exclaim in 
all caps, “Even if they were selling 
goals at Yost tonight our card 
would get declined!!!”

Lavigne hasn’t always stood on 

his head like he did that weekend. 
But like the Wolverines as a team, 
he’s mostly alternated between 
solid and great for the last three 
months.

He’s had rough patches, 

sure — three goals in the first 

eight minutes of the Big Ten 
Tournament. But he’s been 
dominant at times — a shutout 
of the Fighting Irish on Feb. 
18. And there’s been some luck 
involved — Andrew Oglevie’s 
shot painstakingly crawling 
across the crease and past an 
open net in the final minute of the 
aforementioned shutout.

“There’s obviously still room to 

improve, as there always will be,” 
Lavigne said Monday. “But I feel 
this is some of the best hockey I’ve 
played in my career.”

That hockey has brought 

him and his team to the Frozen 
Four, to a place Michigan wasn’t 
supposed to be this year.

Notre Dame and Ohio State are 

No. 1 seeds. Minnesota-Duluth 
was on this stage a year ago. 
Compared to the rest of the field, 

the Wolverines are outsiders, and 
they know it.

“Out of the four teams, we were 

probably the least likely to get 
there,” Pearson said last week. “ … 
Obviously we’re the underdog.”

In net, this theme remains. Cale 

Morris, Sean Romeo and Hunter 
Shepard all rank in the top-10 
nationally in save percentage. 
Lavigne? He sits 39th, with a 
relatively pedestrian .909 figure.

But like the three-point shot 

in basketball, goaltending is 
hockey’s great equalizer. Could 
Lavigne outduel Morris, Romeo or 
Shepard over a multi-game series, 
all other variables being equal? 
Probably not. But can he take over 
a single game by himself? Without 
question — he’s done it before.

Here’s the thing, however: he 

doesn’t have to.

Four months ago, Lavigne 

might have needed to will 
Michigan to a victory over the 
Fighting Irish, Buckeyes or 
Bulldogs. But that’s no longer the 
case — and it’s the end result of a 
process that was made possible 
because of him.

Slow, incremental improvement 

in every facet of the game has 
gotten the Wolverines, and 
Lavigne, this far. Sure, it hasn’t 
necessarily been special, but it’s 
been enough — just like Lavigne’s 
run in early January.

And when Lavigne held down 

the fort, Michigan — as a team — 
followed suit.

Pearson doesn’t anticipate, nor 

does he want, Lavigne playing 
Superman this weekend. All he 
desires out of his netminder is 
security in the crease.

“He’s going to have to make a 

number of good saves,” Pearson 
said Monday. “But we don’t expect 
him to have to carry us. Can he do 
that? Absolutely. He’s had some 
games where we’ve given up too 
many chances against, but we’re 
going to hopefully play better 
defensively in front of him and cut 
down the shots.”

Added Lavigne: “I expect to 

come out there and make the saves 
I’m supposed to, and then make 
some that I’m not. I plan to go out 
there and hold the team in it when 
they need me, and at the same 
time I expect them to do the same 
for me.”

If the Wolverines need a hero 

in St. Paul, Lavigne might be the 
most likely to take on that role. But 
somewhat ironically, he’s done his 
part to make sure that they won’t.

It all began with Hayden 

Lavigne. Thanks to him, Michigan 
can end its run as a team.

It might not be fancy. 

More likely, it will be solid, 
unspectacular even.

And it might just be enough.

Sophomore goaltender Hayden Lavigne is the most likely candidate to play hero in the Frozen Four, but thanks to his own leadership, he may not have to at all.

For Eastern, ‘M’ matchup is more than a game

Melissa Gentile loves Alumni 

Field.

Everything — the field, the 

Alumni Band, the energy from 
the stands — it all transports 
her back to her days as a player 
under Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. Now, as the head 
coach at Eastern Michigan, she 
looks forward to the competition 
the Wolverines provide in an 
annual matchup between the 
two teams. Eighteen years after 
graduating, it’s still her home 
away from home.

On Wednesday, Gentile will 

return to Alumni Field, not 
knowing if she’ll ever be back.

After 
this 
season, 
her 

program will no longer exist.

***

Gentile found out Monday 

evening, Mar. 19. The rest of 
her team was told at 7:30 on 
Tuesday morning.

The athletic department was 

short on funds. It was cutting 
four sports, including softball. 
Once the season was over, the 
team would be no more.

The Eagles’ first conference 

series against Buffalo was that 
weekend. But all of a sudden, 
it was the last thing on their 
minds.

Gentile ran her practices 

with urgency. Her focus was 
no 
longer 
winning 
games. 

Instead, it was making sure that 
her team’s last days together 
weren’t wasted.

“(We’re) just trying to enjoy 

every moment with each other 
and 
relish 
every 
moment,” 

Gentile said. “ … Just trying 
to infuse some fun into a very 
difficult situation that they’re 
going through, so it’s any little 
thing that we can do … to keep 
them loose and trying to keep 
them 
positive 
and 
moving 

forward.”

She infuses that fun into 

every practice, whether it’s a 
game of tag with the coaches 
or kicking around a hacky-sack. 
Off the field, she consoles her 
players while they cry over their 
uncertain futures. She calls 
other coaches asking if they 

have room on their rosters. Her 
own future is on hold because 
the team comes first.

“My family and I will land on 

our feet,” Gentile said. “… I’m 
just worried about our players 
and making sure they’re taken 
care of.”

Even 
before 
the 

announcement, it had been 
over two weeks since Eastern 
Michigan had won a game. And 
now, with the dissolution of 
the only program these players 
have ever known, it’s seemingly 
a never-ending spiral, a 17-game 
losing streak that shows no 
signs of ending any time soon.

Before each game, Gentile 

gives them a typical coach’s pep 
talk. Live in the moment. One 
game at a time.

“All those things sound right 

to tell them,” Gentile said. “But 
while telling them that, they’re 
talking to other college coaches 
and trying to find opportunities 
to transfer to schools and have 
a plan.”

Faced with losing the thing 

they loved, it seemed impossible 
to 
focus 
on 
something 
so 

frivolous as a singular game.

***

Twenty minutes across town, 

the Michigan softball program 
is the antithesis of the Eagles’. 
The Wolverines always draw 
large crowds. They contend not 
only for conference titles, but 
national titles. They’ve won 
22 of their last 23 games. They 
have nothing to worry about.

But for both programs, the 

benefits of a yearly matchup are 
similar.

For 
Hutchins, 
non-

conference home games early 
in the Big Ten season help get 
her team accustomed to the 
distractions of the sometimes-
rowdy 
crowd. 
For 
Gentile, 

the Wolverines provide the 
toughest 
competition 
the 

Eagles will face all season — 
similarly 
good 
preparation 

for Mid-America Conference 
play. And for both, the game 
provides an opportunity to 
reconnect. Gentile has always 
seen Hutchins as a mentor, the 
person she looks to for advice.

Now, though, those reasons 

seem so meaningless.

“We’re trying to get our 

emotions in check and come out 
and really go out with a bang,” 
Gentile said. “We know that 
our games are limited and our 
opportunities are limited. … 

Our kids are devastated.”

If this were a movie, Eastern 

Michigan would come out on 
Wednesday and beat Michigan 
— or at least put up a fight. It 
would spark them to a streak 
to end its season. The Eagles 
would band together and save 
their team.

But 
this 
is 
Washtenaw 

County, not Hollywood. The 
athletic department made it 
clear to Gentile that its decision 
is final. And take your pick at 
any stat — it’s clear that the 
probability of an upset is almost 
nonexistent.

Instead, Eastern Michigan 

will 
approach 
the 
game 

knowing that after it’s over, the 
Eagles will have just 14 games 
left together. There’s little hope 
of salvaging their program or 
their season, so instead they’ll 
come to Alumni Field holding 
onto everything they still have. 
Their devotion to the game. 
Their spirit. And each other.

“I hope this team’s legacy … 

is that they just go out leaving 
their hearts on the field,” 
Gentile said. “And whatever 
happens, happens, but they 
leave their heart and passion for 
what they do on the field.”

MEN’S GYMNASTICS 
Seniors celebrated in 
regular season finale

Five years after arriving in 

Ann Arbor, Tristian Perez-
Rivera finally got his Senior 
Night celebration.

After missing all of the 2016 

season and most of the 2017 
season due to injuries, the 
senior was granted a fifth year 
of eligibility in 2018. While his 
performance is now limited 
to just one or two events, he 
remains an integral part of the 
Michigan men’s gymnastics 
team.

“It’s too bad Tristian, with 

his health issues, is down to 
just doing a couple of events,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kurt 

Golder. “But those two guys, 
(senior Dmitri Belanovski) and 
Tristian, have really helped a 
tremendous amount.”

Before 
Saturday’s 
meet 

against 
the 
University 
of 

Illinois-Chicago, 
Golder 

and the Wolverines honored 
Perez-Rivera, Belanovski and 
volunteer 
assistant 
coach 

Brennen Thomas.

Belanovski 
and 
Perez-

Rivera have both starred in 
competition 
during 
their 

time 
at 
Michigan, 
while 

Thomas’ 
contributions 
are 

less 
immediately 
obvious. 

But 
Golder 
was 
quick 
to 

point out his key role during 
competitions, and anyone who 
has attended a meet has seen 
Thomas working with each and 
every gymnast throughout the 
competition. 

“He tried out for the team 

two years in a row, got cut two 
years in a row,” Golder said. 
“He’s extremely valuable as you 
can see during the meet, he’s 
very helpful to the program.”

Thomas 
is 
frequently 

the 
first 
to 
congratulate 

the gymnasts after a strong 

performance, but he serves 
an equally important role in 
reassuring a gymnast after a 
disapponting routine. 

Belanovski 
earned 
All-

American honors in 2015 and 
2016, though he missed most of 
the 2017 season with injuries. 
As a captain this year, his 
leadership has been key for the 
Wolverines as they’ve battled 
inconsistency throughout the 
season.

Saturday’s 
competition 

took place at Crisler Center, 
rather than the team’s usual 
home of Cliff Keen Arena. 
This move was intentional, 
preparing Michigan for the Big 
Ten Championships coming 
to Crisler next week. For the 
seniors, the extra experience 
in the competition arena will 
be a big advantage in the 
championship.

“It was special out here, 

competing 
on 
a 
podium 

especially. I don’t think there’s 
ever been a Senior Night on a 
podium 
before,” 
Belanovski 

said. “It was a nice test run 
before Big Tens, consider it a 
little bit of Senior Night part 
one.”

The Wolverines have not 

won a conference title since 
2014, Perez-Rivera’s freshman 
season. He is the only gymnast 
on the team with a title under 
his belt, so the rest of the 
seniors are looking forward 
to making a run for their first 
title.

“We’re at home, you know, 

it’s ours to lose,” Belanovski 
said. “I think we have a great 
chance, and we’re ready to 
bring it home.”

And if they do bring it home, 

Perez-Rivera, Belanovski and 
Thomas will get to experience 
Senior Night on a whole new 
level for their final competition 
in Ann Arbor.

Tristian Perez-Rivera and Dmitri 
Belanovski were honored Saturday

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | APRIL 4, 2018

Finding their

voice


I

’m trying to write this column at 
Blue Leprechaun, a bar and grill 
on South University Avenue. 

A$AP Ferg’s “Plain Jane” is playing 
over the speakers and Bayern Munich is 
currently beating Borussia Dortmund 
five goals to nil. The other people at 
the table are enjoying their Saturday, 
camped out playing cards while waiting 
for Michigan men’s basketball to tip 
off in the Final Four against Loyola-
Chicago and Sister Jean.

I’ve been continuously asking people 

for ideas for this piece but I’ve shot 
down every one out of stubbornness. My 
sister just texted me a video of my dog. I 
feel like I’m actually doing a “stream of 
consciousness” piece like the ones I read 
in AP English. I remember reading those 
and not understanding one word of them.

I’m going to be honest, I had no idea 

what to write about in this column. Elise 
Laarman, my co-copy chief, and I pitched 
the Copy That series to our copy editors. 

No one signed up to write the April 4 
column, so I took one for the team.

My initial ideas included writing 

about how golf relates to Copy, how my 
alternative spring break experience 
connects to Copy, the joy of being 
an arbiter of words at The Michigan 
Daily and an examination of the 
future of copy editing. In the end, 
I’m not confident writing about any 
of these topics. Maybe this lack of 
creativity is why I’m a copy editor and 
not writing editorial columns or TV 
reviews. I mean, my predecessor wrote 
something similar in a previous Copy 
That article. Maybe it’s in our DNA.

I like to think I’m creative in real life, 

but just not in my writing. I can live not 
being creative in my writing — I don’t 
aspire to write the next great American 
novel. The only idea about which I could 
write a lot is golf and Tiger Woods, but I 
need at least 2,000 words to do that and 
it still would have way too much going 

on. But here we are. My 800 words on 
golf and Tiger Woods are lying in a 
different Microsoft Word document 
saved as “Copy That.” This is “Copy 
That Two.”

I realize this is turning into the 

ramblings of someone who wasn’t meant 
to write a column. Angela Lin wrote in 
her Copy That article that it was never 
meant to exist. I understand that.

I initially wanted to join Opinion when 

I came to The Daily before I was steered 
to Copy. Imagine my columns. I have deep 
respect for our columnists.

My friend Matt Harmon writes the 

“Soundtracking” column every other 
week, and it’s incredible. But that makes 
sense. That’s his passion. He loves to write. 
I love sports, politics, barbeque chips, 
my Co-Copy Chief Elise Laarman and, of 
course, editing. But writing is not editing 
and it requires a whole different set of skills.

This whole process reminds me of 

Michael Scott in “The Office” episode 

when they have to make a local ad. Scott 
says, “Has anyone told you you’re not 
creative? That’s outrageous. I love this 
place!” Michael Scott has my back. I’m 
much more appreciative of being a copy 
editor now and not having to worry 
about creative content every week. Arts 
and Opinion and the Statement can 
handle this creative content stuff. I’ll 
stick to being a copy editor.

I feel like I’m stealing this from 

Matt too. He wrote a “Soundtracking” 
column about not knowing what to 
write about earlier in the semester 
and I enjoyed it very much. I just want 
Matt to know I’m not stealing this 
format, but rather it’s an homage to his 
creative work.

Sadia Jiban wrote a wonderful Copy 

That column about how copy editors 
see what others don’t. It’s a very true 
sentiment. As a copy editor, I now see 
why I am not a writer for our paper.

Elise Laarman wrote a great piece on 

styling her hometown of St. Louis. Sadly, 
there is only one way to style Houghton, 
MI so the nice piece about home is out 
the window.

I’ve thought about what I’m going to 

do after my time as copy chief and I’ve 
thought being a columnist would be fun. 
Right now, it’s not sounding super fun.

I’m starting to think I pass over ideas 

because I want the perfect idea and 
then the perfect column. But that’s not 
possible. You can write good, even great, 
columns, but not perfect ones. With 
copy editing, you can edit perfectly for 
style and facts. AP Style is definitive 
and facts are indisputable. Not to say I 
edit every piece perfectly but it’s more 
attainable. I had to hand this column off 
to Elise for some editing and she gave 
me this analogy: Creating something 
out of nothing is hard. Like mining for 
diamonds. Writers dig the rock, editors 
polish the gems.

Well I’ve hit my word count and 

I am going to close out this column. 
Ironically, my own column will hit my 
desk on Tuesday night before print on 
Wednesday. Hopefully I won’t leave too 
many copy notes for myself.

Soundtracking: A Perfect Day 

T

he End — The Doors

“This is the end / My only 

friend, the end”

This has been quite the journey for 

my mom and me, who is probably the 
only person to keep reading this column. 
We’ve been through a lot — public 
embarrassment, self-deprecating humor, 
the whole nine yards. But seeing as 
the semester is almost over and I have 
wasted space in the Statement with 
these extended diatribes for a whole 
year, I’ve decided this will be the last 
Soundtracking column in the paper.

(The truth is I was actually forced to 

retire by Statement staff but I wanted it to 
seem like it was my decision). 

I thought I would end my Statement 

career on a high note, one more uplifting 
column as opposed to downtrodden and 
all about how I continuously make a 
fool of myself. Though that humor still 
appeals to me, I feel as though my final 
column should mean a little more. If you 
want more “Matt can’t do anything right” 
content, just follow me around for a day. 
It’s inevitable. But please tell me if you are 
following me because I expect you to be 
in full trench coat, sunglasses and wide 
brim hat, reading a newspaper with eye-
holes poked through.

When I was on an Alternative Spring 

Break trip in Harlan, Ky. this year, we spent 
a lot of time in a van. While the abstract 
idea of being forced into a University of 
Michigan van with five strangers, driving 
for hours on end for a whole week, doesn’t 
sound that appealing, it turned out to be 
an incredible experience. You get to know 
each other really quick. I believe the first 
story I told before we had even left Ann 
Arbor was the time I almost drove my 
grandma’s van through her garden when 
I was eight.

Adult Diversion — Alvvays
I stand by my belief that if you want 

to really get to know someone, ask 
them to describe their perfect day.

You don’t get the vague “I like music 

and hanging out with friends” responses. 
You get true passions. You understand 
what really makes them happy. And that 
is beautiful in its own right.

Driving away from the Cumberland 

Gap, my van mates got on the topic 
of describing a perfect day back 
home. While many of us were from 
Michigan, our days were completely 
different due to the surroundings we 
grew up in. I can’t describe everyone 
else’s days to the tee like they could, 
but I can give a quick outline of mine.

My perfect day would start with 

me waking up — a crucial start to any 
day, ever. I’d be in my twin bed in my 
childhood room in Royal Oak. I’d roll 
over to only be met by my bright red 
walls (which I picked out even though my 
mom thought it would look horrible) and 
the sunlight beaming through my pink 

and purple window curtains, bathing 
the room in lavender. Immediately I 
would text Charlotte, who I met in 
kindergarten and has never been able 
to get rid of me, her sister Becca and our 
friend Louie about breakfast. It would be 
probably about 10:00 a.m. on a Saturday 
as I’d hop in the shower, hang with my 
mom while she made coffee and start 
cleaning the house and throw on clothes 
before running out of the house to meet 
Charlotte, Becca and Louie.

Heading down Crooks Road with 

“Ann Delisi’s Essential Music” on WDET 
booming through my car’s radio, I’d pull 
into National Coney Island on Main 
Street — a Royal Oak tradition that still 
holds a special place in my heart. Finding 
the gang in the parking lot, we’d run in 
and grab a booth in the corner.

Starfish and Coffee — Prince
As we’d find our seat, I’d scan the room, 

looking for people I hadn’t seen in a few 
months. I’d inevitably see two or three. It 
was bound to happen at National.

I’d order my favorite breakfast National 

order: spinach, feta and tomato omelet 
with black coffee and crispy hash browns 
— the perfect start to my day. Laughing 
about the events in each of our lives since 
the last time we’d seen each other (which 
was probably a few days prior if I’m being 
honest), we’d shoot the shit and scarf 
down plates of breakfast food. I’d toss my 
Coney Bucks Rewards Card I always keep 
in my wallet down with my bill and make 
plans to see them all tomorrow.

Hopping in my car, I’d call my friend 

Michael to make sure he’s free and swing 
by to pick him up. We’d automatically 
know where we’d be adventuring to once 
I got on I-75 toward downtown.

From Eden — Hozier
The original John K. King Used & Rare 

Books location on Lafayette Boulevard 
in downtown Detroit is arguably the 
greatest place on Earth.

Fuck Disney World.
I used to say John King was four stories 

but then I realized that was an incredibly 
confusing way to describe a bookstore. 
Now I end up saying it’s four floors of 
endless hallways stacked to the ceiling 
with any book you can imagine. It’s the 
only place in the world where I’m grateful 
for the dust that causes my allergies to act 
up. You need a map to get around this 
place — and in fact, they do supply you 
with one. Otherwise, you might have to 
send up a flare to have the store rangers 
come rescue you.

With Michael scanning the radio but 

ultimately leaving it on WDET because 
nothing beats Ann Delisi, I’d pull into 
the tiny parking lot next to the bookstore 
behemoth. We’d spend hours there, 
grabbing titles off the shelf and reading a 
chapter or two on milk crates in the deep 
corners of the store. I always position 
myself next to the windows so the light, 

diffused by wax paper, illuminates the 
page and increases the contrast of the 
black typeface on the cream pages.

Finding each other every now and 

then, I’d ask what he’s been reading. 
With Michael, it’s most likely some 
ancient biology or engineering book or, 
occasionally, an extended philosophical 
novel. I would be huddled up next to the 
paperback Dramatists Play Service box, 
finding foldable copies of plays I’ve never 
heard of and reading the first scene to see 
how the playwright decided to break the 
stasis of their play — arguably the most 
important decision in a play.

With a few titles in our hands, we’d 

check out and drive to Hamtramck 
to crack into our new paperback 
adventures. I’d need a cup of coffee to 
pair with a new text.

Best One — NxWorries
We’d 
roam 
around 
Hamtramck, 

looking for street parking, until we’d 
inevitably find a spot and run inside 
Cafe 1923.

There are a few reasons why 1923 is 

included in my perfect day. First, the 
coffee is incredible, and its only a quarter 
for refills. Second, they always play Bob 
Dylan over the speakers. Finally, they 
have a back room with large windows 
letting sunlight in, comfy chairs, chess 
tables and bookshelves surrounding the 
entire space. That way, if we want a break 
from our new books, we can scour the 
shelves around us until we find another 
book that piques our interest. It’s also 
an amazing writing space. I’d bring my 
raggedy notebook and a pen to work on 
any various writing I choose. The world 
is my oyster at Cafe 1923.

After two hours of reading and writing 

and sipping coffee, we’d head toward 
Redford for a night at my second favorite 
place on Earth — Redford Theater.

The theater, which has a Japanese 

motif, was covered up during World War 
II but was eventually restored. Now, 
they screen older flicks. I’ve been going 
there since I was eight. It’s where I saw 

my favorite movie, “It’s a Wonderful 
Life,” for the first time.

Honestly, I wouldn’t care what movie 

was playing that night. I’d just want to see 
the theater again. After buying our tickets 
and walking around, marveling at the giant 
screen and the ceiling which twinkles like 
stars, we’d take our seats and wait for the 
original Barton Theater organ to rise out 
of the pit and begin the 30-minute concert 
before the movie.

Wait for the Moment — Vulfpeck
By the time the movie is over, it would 

most likely be about 10:30 p.m. I’d drive 
Michael back to Royal Oak and drive 
around in the dark for a while, listening 
to music and letting the activities of the 
day soak in.

Pulling into a parking lot because texting 

while driving is bad, I’d text my friends 
from high school who went to the local 
Catholic school. It’s a long, convoluted 
story as to how a public-schooled half-
Jew came to be such good friends with 
kids raised in the Catholic school system, 
but I’m always grateful for their presence. 
Even at 11:00 at night, a lot of them would 
still be up and game for anything. But we 
all know where we’d end up — National 
Coney Island is open 24 hours.

Back To Back — Drake
We’d all meet in the parking lot just 

like I did with Charlotte, Becca and Louie 
earlier that morning and we’d cross our 
fingers, hoping the big corner booth is 
open. In my perfect day, it would already 
have our names on it.

There, I’d order a Diet Coke and laugh 

the entire night, quoting Vines and just 
swapping stories since the last time we’d 
all been together. We’d leave at 2:00 a.m. 
and I’d finally head home. Collapsing in 
bed, I’d take a deep breath and hope to 
remember that feeling of excitement and 
bliss forever. I know it would be gone in 
the morning but all I can do is dream. As 
my eyelids drift closed, I’d get ready to 
make the next day the best it can be. 
Because that’s all I can ask for.

Perfect Day — Lou Reed

Finding their voice: Inside an American 

accent workshop

by Maya Goldman, Daily News Editor

I

n an ivy-covered building hid-
den in the depths of the medi-
cal campus, a big wooden table 
sits in the center of a small blue 

room. At the head of the table sits Senior 
Speech-Language Pathologist Gordon 
Krainen, who leads a workshop titled 
“Speaking American English: A Com-
munication Skills Workshop for English 
Language Learners.” Surrounding him 
are five participants from across the 
world, and with Krainen’s help, they’re 
all trying to master the American accent.

This is the third week of the seminar, 

and they’re working on the differences 
between “s” and “z” sounds. It’s a differ-
ence that can seem obvious to a native 
English speaker.

“I didn’t know about these things until 

I started studying this,” Krainen assures 
the group.

But many non-English languages don’t 

distinguish between the two sounds. 
They have other sounds native English 
speakers might not pick up on at first, too. 
According to the Linguistic Society of 
America, this is part of the reason speak-
ers of different languages have different 
accents. While humans are born with the 

capability to produce and perceive all the 
sounds available in the world, they learn 
early on which ones are used in their own 
languages and which ones not to worry 
about.

“The older you get, the harder it 

becomes to learn the sounds that are part 
of a different language,” the Society’s 
website reads.

This is exactly the task the six reg-

istered course participants — Krainen 
shies away from using the word “stu-
dents” because he sees them as his equals 
— are trying to accomplish through 
this 10-week course. Each participant 
has been learning English for at least a 
decade, so they all have a strong com-
mand of the language, but none of them 
previously 
practiced 
speaking 
much 

until they came to the United States. And 
while every participant has their own 
reason for taking the course, all are cen-
tered around the same theme: building 
confidence.

Zoey, an LSA sophomore from China 

studying computer science, asked not to 
have her last name printed—she hasn’t 
brought up the fact that she’s taking the 
class with her friends yet. Smiling from 

the moment she hurries into the room 
with a bulging backpack and headphones 
around her neck, it’s difficult to imag-
ine her classifying herself as shy. But 
she came to the workshop because she 
found herself too nervous to speak in his-
tory discussions. She worried her profes-
sor wouldn’t be able to understand her 
accent.

“I’m afraid of speaking out because 

they cannot understand what I’m say-
ing,” she said. “And I have the idea that 
my pronunciation is somewhat different 
from the standard American accent, but 
I cannot tell where I should improve, so 
I took this class to see what’s wrong with 
my pronunciation.”

Next to her sits Sandra, a Spanish lan-

guage lecturer in the Residential Col-
lege from Peru who also didn’t want her 
last name printed. Because she speaks 
Spanish at work and at home, she hasn’t 
had much time to practice her American 
accent. When she has to clarify a word 
for her students in English, she worries 
they can’t tell what she’s saying.

“If I need to clarify a word, I need to be 

speaking english and the student is clue-
less!” Sandra said. “Sometimes they’re 

like what? So I have to repeat the same 
thing.”

On the other side of the table is Lau-

rent Burlion, a quiet visiting aerospace 
engineering scholar from France with a 
friendly face. He says his wife suggested 
he take the class so he would feel more 
comfortable speaking up— in English or 
in his native French.

“I’m here to learn to open my mouth,” 

Burlion said. “But I think it’s also use-
ful for my French because my wife also 
thinks that I don’t open my mouth… And 
also I have remarked that here in the 
U.S., often people ask me to repeat. So 
I’m here to improve my speech so I don’t 
have to repeat all the time.”
K

rainen is a mild-mannered guy 
who readily doles out positive 
reinforcements to his clients. 

He’s a trained speech pathologist and 
became interested in accent modifica-
tion about 25 years ago. While speech 
pathologists often treat people who have 
communication or neurological disorders 
that affect their speech, Krainen found 
himself drawn to helping people who had 
a social desire to alter their speech. After 
noticing a need for an accent modifica-
tion workshop on the University of Mich-
igan’s campus two years ago, Krainen 
decided to started the workshop.

Most of the workshop’s participants 

find out about it through word-of-mouth 
recommendations or some limited adver-
tising around the University and online. 
According to Jennifer Corey, Clinic Man-
ager for the University Center for Lan-
guage and Literacy, the department in 
which the workshop is housed, some of 
the online advertising caused the work-
shop to come under fire this past winter 
for being potentially “insensitive.” While 
the UCLL did not disclose much infor-
mation about the pushback, Corey said 
she remembered it having to do with an 
angry Facebook comment.

“A person may have thought that we’re 

trying to change something that’s part of 
someone, and why do you want to change 
this person when you’re perfectly fine 
the way they are?” Corey said.

Indeed, it’s easy to imagine why some 

might question the motives of this work-
shop. What’s wrong with an accent? But 
Corey explained goal of the workshop is 
not to paint any accent as “incorrect” or 
to minimize anyone’s culture. It’s a self-
selecting course that seeks to help inter-

ested people communicate with their 
peers.

“We’re not trying to change someone,” 

Corey explained. “That person is coming 
to us, because they’re having difficulty in 
whatever situation they’re in… we’re not 
going to get rid of their accent. We value 
everybody’s accent.”

Despite some pushback, the workshop 

continues to grow in popularity. Krainen 
still wants to keep it small, though—it’s 
more impactful that way, he says.

The small size also makes sense consid-

ering how labor-intensive the class is for 
Krainen. During the first hour-long class 
of the seminar, he has each participant 
complete a small video-taped assessment 
so he can analyze their speech patterns. 
He guides them through what an accent 
is, how they acquired their accent and 
the reason their languages’ sound sys-
tems are different from the one English 
employs.

The next week, after he’s analyzed 

the tapes, Krainen makes a list of goals 
for each person, complete with all the 
sounds he thinks they need to work on. 
Sometimes the modifications are more 
grammar-based, like making sure to tack 
an “s” sound on the end of a plural noun, 
and other times they’re specific vowels or 
consonants he thinks could be improved. 
Sometimes the group has similar things 
to work on; sometimes each person has a 
totally different curriculum.

Krainen 
doesn’t 
mind 
the 
work, 

though. He says the real challenge is 
keeping up with the progress his partici-
pants make.

“They’re so bright, so motivated,” he 

said. “I’ve got to stay somewhat ahead of 
them just to say well, ‘Oh OK, you guys 
are challenging me now.’ But it’s a real 
fun experience and I’m hoping to see it 
keep on going.”

It seems like one would have to be 

bright and motivated to commit them-
selves to the accent modification process. 
Krainen recommends 15-20 minutes of 
practice outside of class every day.

To him, it’s like playing the piano. 
“I play piano, and you have to learn 

some basic chords, basic scales to learn 
the tune and then to get really good 
you’ve got to do it for a long time and 
really go over these things,” he said. “You 
could take lessons for almost forever and 
keep on improving… it’s the same idea of 
fine tuning.”

Burlion agrees constant practice is the 

only way he would actually be able to 
develop a more American accent. Even if 
he does that, though, he knows it could 
take him a long time to get to where he’d 
like to be.

“I feel mistakes, but it’s step by step,” 

Burlion said. “I think I need to practice a 
lot. But I have realized that I can do it. I 
can practice, and step by step it’ll come.”

Sometimes, though, practicing itself 

is a daunting task for Burlion. He says 
he’s finding the class valuable, but now 
instead of feeling more able to open his 

mouth, his new knowledge of American 
pronunciation makes him want to keep 
it shut all the more. In class, Gordon 
stresses the importance of exaggerating 
certain vowels, but Burlion worries about 
overdoing it.

“I’m afraid to exaggerate and make 

people laugh, you know? If I say I need 
to SOOOOlve the PROOOOOBlem, people 
will laugh,” he said.

Even if he doesn’t practice his own 

accent much at work, Burlion finds him-
self paying close attention to how his col-
leagues speak.

“Now every time I go to a seminar, I 

understand the math or something like 
that — it’s very interesting — but I’m 
focused on the accent! I’m like ‘Oh wow, 
they speak so well!,’” he said. “I could not 
do any seminar! Not because of the math 
or engineering stuff, but because of my 
accent. I find everybody — they speak so 
well!”

Of course, the intricacies of an Ameri-

can accent can’t be learned in just 10 
weeks. Jason, a Chinese engineer who 
isn’t affiliated with the University, found 
out about the workshop through his boss 
at Chrysler. He found the course so help-
ful that he’s currently taking it for the 
third time.

“I think the first purpose (of taking the 

class) is to improve (my) work relation-
ship with my co-workers, because they 
are all Americans,” Jason said. “I think 
the second purpose is also life, because 
I’m living in the U.S., and it’s an English-
speaking country. When I watch TV or 
read the news or read books, I have to 
speak English. So it’s much better for me 
to improve my English.”

Chan Jong Na, an enthusiastic and 

talkative LSA sophomore who goes by 
CJ, is on his second time through the 
workshop. Originally from Korea, he 

spent two years of high school in Michi-
gan but came to Krainen because he felt 
like he could only improve so much on 
his own. Na is so dedicated to modify-
ing his accent that he also pursued other 
avenues of working on it.

“I took an Intro to Acting class last 

semester,” Na said. “I think it helped me 
speak better English. It’s more vibrant, 
acting— it’s lively English.”

Na and Zoey, who are taking this class 

on top of their regular academic sched-
ule, say finding the time to practice is 
almost an impossible task. While Zoey 
hopes to continue working on her accent 
next year, she thinks it’ll be easier for her 
to practice on her own from the textbook 
all course participants get for the work-
shop.

“For the next year, I think I’ll have 

more difficult courses, and (it’ll be) hard 
for me to make time for this course,” she 
said. “But I think I may follow the book 
and practice following the recording and 
try to speak more English.”

Na agrees it can be overwhelming to 

work on his accent at the same time as 
his schoolwork, but he says it helps to 
remember why he’s taking the class in 
the first place.

“(In the past) my friends would point 

out, ‘Hey, you said that again,’” he said. 
“But now I don’t hear that that much, so I 
have more confidence.”
I

t’s the last session of the class, a 
cold and dreary Michigan day at 
the end of March. The class start-

ed with six participants, but attendance 
has dwindled. Only Na, Zoey and Sandra 
could make it this week. According to 
Krainen, past workshops have had more 
consistent attendance, but he under-
stands it can be difficult to find time.

Krainen begins the session by record-

ing each person saying a list of words. 

With a small handheld camera and a 
little black tripod, he video-tapes each 
person reciting their list. Just like at the 
beginning of the workshop, he plans on 
analyzing the recording and emailing 
everyone a list of sounds they could con-
tinue to improve on if they choose to keep 
practicing.

“I want to say, I’m really impressed 

with all of you and the work you’ve 
done,” he tells them at the end of the 
class. Krainen is always quick to chime 
in with positive reinforcement, and this 
is no exception.”

“You’ve showed progress. It’s not an 

overnight process, it’s a gradual process, 
and you’ve got to immerse yourself. Con-
gratulations, you guys, you did a great 
job.”

The class is over, but the participants 

want to keep improving. Sandra says she 
feels like she still struggles with many 
parts of the American accent, but she’s 
beginning to recognize her mistakes. 
Na says he knows he’s getting better but 
isn’t ready to stop working at it. He might 
come back for a third go at the class next 
fall.

“I’m definitely getting my points 

across, but the thing is, whenever I 
make a mistake I know it, and it’s kind of 
embarrassing,” he said. “So I’m trying to 
make that happen less often.”

Zoey feels more confident now, though 

speaking up in her history discussion is 
still scary.

“I’m still scared, even today!” she said. 

“I think basically it’s the information, 
and I’m not quite sure how the Ameri-
can students can speak up so quickly, and 
how they can organize their sentences in 
such a short time.”

“Oh, but if we were to learn Chinese we 

would be kind of slow too, to respond,” 
Krainen assures her.

riving through the valley, 
we 
could 
see 
a 
storm 

looming in the distance, but 

all we could do was hope it wouldn’t 
be coming toward us. It’s incredibly 
difficult to predict where a storm 
is heading in the mountains, as one 
ridge will force it east and the next 
will push it south.

As we pulled up to the trailhead, 

with the presence of the storm fading 
from our minds, a clap of thunder 
echoed 
between 
the 
mountains, 

reminding us that there would be no 
escape.

This was exactly what I was hoping 

wouldn’t happen. I was being dropped 
off with my girlfriend at a trailhead, 
and from there we would be almost 
completely alone for the next six days.

The trail, the Sawback Trail in 

Alberta, 
Canada, 
would 
take 
us 

from Lake Louise to Banff, Alberta. 

Winding through three passes and 
over 46 miles, it was easily the most 
ambitious backpacking trip either of 
us had taken.

I was used to backpacking in 

Michigan and in Ontario, Canada, and 
had done so a number of times, but 
this was a completely new adventure. 
Backpacking at high elevation changes 
everything, from how the weather 
moves, 
to 
causing 
below-freezing 

temperatures in July. And I had 
always gone out in bigger groups, with 
someone who was more experienced 
than I was at the time.

I was trying to put on a façade 

of 
being 
uber-confident 
and 
not 

concerned about what we were faced 
with so my girlfriend wouldn’t get 
any more worried, but my nerves 
were eating away at me. I couldn’t 
stop wondering if we were making the 
right decision.

Reluctantly, we lifted our nearly 

50-pound 
backpacks 
on 
to 
our 

shoulders, clipped our hip belts and 
set off. Soon after we started trekking 
up the rest of the pass, the storm 
caught us. The near golf ball-sized 
hail forced us to stop and wait under a 
tree, but the lightning suggested that 
might be unwise.

At 
this 
moment, 
we 
were 

questioning what the hell we were 
even doing on that trail. Neither of 
us had backpacked in Banff, or in any 
sort of elevation for that matter.

On top of that, I was the more 

experienced backpacker of the two 
of us, leaving me to make most of 
our decisions. When I made this 
realization, coupled with being in the 
mountains and turbulent conditions, I 
became more scared than I ever have 
been while backpacking.

The pressure of knowing that your 

safety, as well as someone else’s safety, 
rides completely on your decision 
making is scary and overwhelming. 
Regardless of how ready I felt prior 
to the trip, at that moment trekking 
up Boulder Pass I felt everything but 
that.

We were challenged with whether 

or not to push forward, completely 
unsure of how long the storm would 
hover above us. On one hand, it could 
stop advancing once it reached the top 
of the pass, but it was just as likely 
to keep going through the pass and 
follow us down the valley on the other 
side.

If we had turned around, we 

wouldn’t have woken up in the middle 
of our first night to the vicious purr 
of a wolverine outside our tent (it 
was confirmed to be a wolverine by a 
friend who was at the same campsite 
a few days later who said he saw one 
there).

If we had turned around, we 

wouldn’t have gotten trail lost for 
over four hours when we came across 
a part of the trail that had been 
completely wiped out by an avalanche 
the previous winter.

But above all, if we had turned 

around, I wouldn’t know that I could 
do it: I would be left wondering if I 
could conquer the rest of the trail.

The sense of accomplishment we 

felt as we hitch-hiked our way down 
the mountain after coming out on 
Mount Norquay, the southern end of 
the Sawback Trail, was unbelievable.

When I found out about the trail 

several months prior, it seemed like 
something incredible to do, but highly 
unlikely to take on given my lack of 
experience navigating complicated 
trails and hiking in big mountain 
ranges. But I went for it anyway, 
trusting what I did know, and came 
away knowing that doubting myself 
wouldn’t get me anywhere. It’s those 
scary, risky situations that teach the 
most.

Backpacking (sometimes too often) 

presents me with near life or death 
situations, where I’m forced to trust 
my decision making, and that’s one of 
the reasons I love it so much. There is 
no room to doubt yourself.

On that day heading up Boulder 

Pass, I was definitely doubting myself. 
I had little confidence that we would 
get off that trail unscathed. But we 
did, and we’re both better for it.

Photographing for The 
Daily has been a great 
outlet for me to explore 
what this campus has to 
offer. Some of the most 
memorable events I have 
been privileged to cap-
ture through The Daily are 
men’s gymnastics, a panel 
of Michigan’s Democratic 
Gubernatorial candidates 
and the Yoni Ki Baat Spring 
Monologue show. The vari-
ety of events I’ve photo-
graphed has challenged me 
to be a more dynamic pho-
tographer. I never felt like I 
was restricted to capturing 
only sports or arts or news 
events. I got a little taste 
of everything, which has 
really helped me appreciate 
my time at the University. I 
was on The Daily last sum-
mer and returned for the 
current semester.

The Daily always seemed 
impenetrable to me. I felt 
like I’d have to have years 
of journalism experience 
to even enter the Student 
Publications Building. How-
ever, I was shown otherwise 
after taking my room-
mates’ advice (shoutout to 
Fahd Ahsan and Ibrahim 
Rasheed, both Daily alums) 
and joining The Daily as a 
columnist in Winter of 2017. 
I’ve worked in Opinion and 
Photo and have come to 
know some truly great indi-
viduals who value truth, and 
more importantly the way 
truth is presented. Best of 
all, I’ve been able to prac-
tice my passions (writing 
opinion pieces and photog-
raphy) in a scheduled man-
ner which has shown me 
how to balance a busy life 
and doing what you love.

I never thought I’d call myself a 
photojournalist. Thanks to the 
existence of The Daily’s photo 
staff, however, I now claim this 
title with pride. I’ve been lucky 
enough to photograph presi-
dents, NCAA tournaments and 
countless other events that have 
shaped my craft. I’ve been able 
to travel the country while look-
ing through my lens to capture 
impactful images, getting a taste 
of sports, music and news. From 
navigating around Ann Arbor 
to highways across the country, 
I’ve made irreplaceable friend-
ships and experienced once in 
a lifetime events because of 
this publication. The Daily has 
allowed me to pursue my pas-
sions and capture the essence of 
the human condition. I couldn’t 
imagine my time at Michigan 
without 420 Maynard, and I will 
forever cherish the experiences 
it gave me. 

Zoey Holmstrom

Unfortunately, the time has come where 
I’ve maxed out my time at The Daily with 
eight semesters full of some of my best 
memories at the University of Michigan. 
Not many people can say they got to wit-
ness The Game go into double overtime 
from the sidelines and watch JT Barrett (who 
may or may not have been short) get that 
infamous first down. Few can say they’ve 
photographed presidents, their favorite band 
or a Michigan football bowl game. And even 
less can say they’ve captured the raw elation 
on our basketball players’ faces when they 
capture a Big Ten Tournament title or punch 
a ticket to the Final Four. And yet The Daily 
has provided me these experiences that I’ll 
remember for a lifetime. Combined with 
the friendships made through late nights at 
production, The Daily was a key component 
to my college identity. Thanks to all my past 
and current MPEs for giving me the oppor-
tunities to shoot big events, and to any staff 
photographer who’s been on my dayside 
taking killer photos — you made my job 
easy. Proud to have been a member of pho-
tostaff for the last four years and excited to 
see what future generations accomplish!
