In 2007, a loose-knit group of 
skateboarders and skateboard 
enthusiasts 
in 
Ann 
Arbor 
decided it was time to create 
a skatepark in a city that has 
many other exceptional public 
amenities. In 2014, after a large 
community effort, Friends of 
the Ann Arbor Skatepark — a 
nonprofit 
public 
skatepark 
in Ann Arbor — was created. 
Twelve years after this initial 
push, the skatepark is a thriving 
nonprofit. And now, it’s elected 
its first female president, Nina 
Juergens, on Jan. 21.
Juergens 
joined 
the 

skatepark 
effort 
in 
2009 
to 
oversee 
branding 
and 
merchandising. She said she 
was 
optimistic 
about 
the 
progress of the skatepark, as 
the interested skate community 
members 
had 
transferable 
knowledge to contribute to the 
project.
“I think the timing happened 
because we were older and knew 
people that could help us along 
the way with volunteering, 
advice, grant writing and legal 
help to form the non-profit 
Friends of the Ann Arbor 
Skatepark,” Juergens said. “It 
truly was a community effort.”
After the grand opening in 
2014, she helped to organize 

and run a free program to teach 
women and girls how to skate. 
As the new president, she hopes 
these programs will continue to 
advance under her leadership.
“Just because it’s built doesn’t 
mean 
it’s 
done 
evolving,” 
Juergens said. “Upon the park 
opening, I co-created a program 
along with Crystle Partington, 
another board member from 
the beginning, called All Girls 
Skate, with free instruction to 
women and girls during the 
summer. We provide all the 
equipment needed. I’d like to 
see more events, programs and 
amenities happen in the future.”
Juergens 
also 
has 
long-
term plans for the skatepark, 

including 
adding 
more 
infrastructure and amenities.
“I’ll be meeting with the head 
of the Parks Department soon,” 
Juergens said. “I would like to 
see lights for winter use and 
things that make it comfortable 
to families to spend the day 
there, such as bathrooms, picnic 
tables and shelter.”
Also elected at the annual 
meeting were Secretary Trevor 
Staples and Treasurer Josh 
Meisler. Meisler has served as 
the 
organization’s 
president 
for the past four years. Meisler 
said 
in 
the 
announcement 
press release that he has high 
hopes for the coming year with 
Juergens as president.

Representative 
Yousef 
Rabhi and Senator Jeff Irwin 
reintroduced the polluter-pay 
bill to Michigan Legislature 
Thursday, Feb. 14. 
The new bill would hold 
corporations 
and 
industries 
responsible 
for 
polluting 
Michigan air and water. State 
Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ypsilanti, 
introduced the bill back in 
2017 to the Michigan House of 
Representatives 
and 
teamed 
up with state Sen. Jeff Irwin, 
D-Petoskey, to reintroduce the 
bill to both the state House and 
Senate this year.
“What 
the 
polluter-pay 
law does is it re-establishes 
a law that we used to have 
in Michigan that says once a 
polluter makes a mess, they 
have to clean it up,” Rabhi said. 
“That’s the simplest way to put 
it.”
Irwin and Rabhi want to 
return to former Michigan 
laws that held pollutants more 
responsible. 
Michigan 
law 
was changed under the Engler 
administration.

Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 
endorsed 
a 
bill 
expanding 
Michigan’s 
texting-while-
driving laws on Wednesday. 
The bill, HB 4198, which 
was introduced by state Rep. 
Triston Cole, R-Charlevoix, 
proposes to make it illegal to 
read emails and send messages 
over 
social 
media 
while 
driving. Additionally, it seeks 
to prevent new drivers ages 16 
and 17, with either level 1 or 
level 2 licenses, from talking 
and listening to a cell phone 
when operating motor vehicles.
In a press release, Cole 
touted 
the 
importance 
of 
creating safer roads by limiting 
distractions for drivers.
“It’s time we put our cell 
phones away while driving—
and that includes checking 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram 
and all the rest of it,” Cole 
wrote. 
“Social 
media 
can 
wait until the driving is done. 
Making this important change 
to Michigan law will keep 
our roads safer for everyone 
by 
eliminating 
potential 
distractions for drivers.”

The University of Michigan 
Board of Regents convened for 
their first meeting of the semester 
Thursday. Prior to a sharing 
of public comments, the board 

presented successes in research 
as well as several renovation 
proposals.
To 
begin 
the 
meeting, 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel emphasized the value 
of 
post-secondary 
education. 
Before 
announcing 
his 
recommendations for Arthur F. 
Thurnau Professorships, awarded 

for 
outstanding 
contributions 
to 
undergraduate 
education, 
Schlissel cited Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer’s goal of having 60 
percent of Michigan residents 
obtain 
a 
post-high 
school 
education. Schlissel noted higher 
education is crucial for the success 
of the state.
“The state of Michigan is made 

stronger by 15 public institutions 
that vary in scope and mission,” 
Schlissel said. “We can see the 
benefits 
amongst 
our 
three 
University of Michigan campuses. 
Additionally, it is a cause for 
optimism that Governor Whitmer 
has set a goal for post-secondary 
educational attainment.

University President Mark Schlissel speaks on post-secondary education at the regents meeting at the University of Michigan Golf Course Thursday.


If we want our state to be 
amongst the most prosperous 
in the nation, we have to be 
amongst 
the 
most 
educated. 
Our students’ businesses and the 
residents deserve this opportunity 
to succeed.”
Schlissel also expressed his 
gratitude 
and 
congratulations 
to several groups and members 
around 
campus. 
Referencing 
the extreme cold that led to the 
cancellation of two days of classes 
this January, Schlissel said he 
is grateful for the work of staff 
members across all three U-M 
campuses in maintaining facilities 
and student safety despite harsh 
weather conditions.
“Extreme cold creates special 
challenges for the University, and 
the staff responded,” Schlissel said. 
“For instance, our buses ran their 
normal routes to ensure that our 
students and employees had safe 
transportation, and some buses 
served as warming stations on key 
campus locations. Maintenance 
teams proactively inspected pipes, 
monitoring for breaks and leaks 
and our custodians monitored 
buildings for safety and assisted 
students 
in 
numerous 
ways. 
I know that staff also on our 

Dearborn and Flint campuses 
worked diligently to support their 
operations as well.”
Schlissel also congratulated 
the 2019 Sloan Research Fellows, 
awarded for being promising 
young researchers, as well as the 
24 students who earned Fulbright 
grants, given to students to 
study internationally. He then 
introduced S. Jack Hu, vice 
president for research, for the 
annual research report.
According to Hu, the University 
saw 
their 
highest 
research 
expenditures on record, with the 
largest grants coming from the 
federal government and industry 
sources.
“Our 
2018 
research 
expenditures reached a total of 
1.55 billion — that is a record high,” 
Hu said. “The federal government 
remains the most significant 
sponsor of our research. For 
the eighth year, U of M ranked 
first among all public research 
universities in the U.S.”
Several building renovation 
proposals were approved by 
the Board of Regents. The first, 
presented by Chuck Lewis of 
Integrated Design Solutions, is 
an $8.9 million renovation to the 
Alumni Center.
According 
to 
Lewis, 
this 
renovation would add over 350 
square feet and update existing 
systems in the Alumni Center 

and will be paid for by the Alumni 
Association. 
“The new west vestibule, 
which is also an addition, is 
designed to complement the 
existing architecture, improve 
the energy efficiency of the 
building, and requires minimal 
changes to the landscape,” Lewis 
said.
The second proposal, a $5 
million Bonisteel Boulevard water 
main and road reconstruction, 
was passed unanimously by the 
board. A third proposal was then 
brought to and passed by the 
board to rebuild the University 
Laundry Building, which serves 
patient care facilities at Michigan 
Medicine, and move it to an 
alternative location. According 
to Kevin Hegarty, the executive 
vice president and chief financial 
officer of the University, the 
facility is over 50 years old.
“It is completely outdated, 
worn 
out 
and 
requires 
replacement,” 
Hegarty 
said. 
“The laundry service it provides 
is critical to the operation of the 
Michigan Medicine hospitals.”
President of Central Student 
Government 
Daniel 
Greene, 
Public Policy senior, spoke in 
front of the regents to given the 
Student 
Government 
Report. 
Congratulating new Regents Paul 
Brown (D) and Jordan Acker (D), 
Greene said he looks forward to 
working on policy points the 
new regents stressed in their 
election process.
“I’d 
like 
to 
start 
by 
congratulating Regent Acker 
and Regent Brown on their 
recent 
election 
victories,” 
Greene said. “The current 
CSG administration stands 
ready to collaborate on many 
of the platform points you both 
ran on, including addressing 
campus 
affordability, 
with a specific focus on 
housing 
affordability 
and 
food insecurity, improving 
equitable support across our 
three campuses, and making 
the 
administration 
and 
regents more accessible to 
students.”
Looking 
to 
discuss 
campus issues such as even 
distribution of resources, food 
insecurity and workers’ rights 
and challenges surrounding 
the new felony self-disclosure 
policy, Greene recommended 
the regents consider making 
several 
endorsements 
to 
address these challenges. In 
discussing equitable resource 
distribution, 
Greene 
said 

all three campuses need to be 
treated and aided equally.
“If we, at the Ann Arbor 
campus, truly believe in our 
University’s 
mission, 
then 
we 
must 
provide 
equitable 
support 
for 
our 
Dearborn 
and 
Flint 
campuses 
that 
disproportionately represented 
lower-income 
students, 
Michigan 
resident 
students 
of color and first-generation 
students,” Greene said. “Our 
school’s mantra, ‘Leaders and 
Best,’ shall hold throughout the 
entirety of our University of 
Michigan academic system.”
Greene reflected on the aims 
and highlights of CSG’s recent 
State of the Students report and 
said he hopes the board will 
consider reviewing the issue 
addressed in the document.
“The State of the Students 
report is an opportunity to 
highlight the accomplishments 
of ongoing projects of the 
current administration,” Greene 
said. “I hope the Regents and 
administrators will take the 
time to explore both forms of the 
report, as the few highlights are 
only a fraction of policy interests 
of current Wolverines.”
***
At 
meeting, 
10 
speakers 
addressed the board during 
the public comments portion. 
The speakers — who included 
students, faculty and community 
members 
— 
discussed 
non-
agenda related items, including 
the One University coalition, 
ethical food purchasing and 
claims of inadequate care at 
Michigan Medicine.
Regent 
Ron 
Weiser 
(R) 
thanked all speakers at the 
meeting for discussing issues 
impacting the University.
“I wanted, on behalf of the 
board, to thank all the speakers 
for taking their time to come here 
and share their views,” Weiser 
said. “These are complex issues, 
and it’s helpful for us to hear your 
thoughts.”
One University
The One University campaign 
is a coalition of students, faculty 
and 
community 
members 
committed 
to 
bolstering 
resources on the Flint and 
Dearborn campuses. LSA senior 
Griffin St. Onge emphasized 
the University’s duty as a public 
university and the importance of 
creating equity among the three 
U-M campuses.

LSA freshman Daniel Dash on his story ““The story of Adam Steinberg: a 
new leader, new culture and new heights”:

“I wanted to get the complete picture, and to me the complete picture means starting from 
square one. I think that a big part of that was looking at (Steinberg’s) previous coaching 
stops, especially where he won the national championship at Pepperdine. Some of the best 
quotes in the article come from the old Pepperdine athletics director. Dr. Watson was more 
than happy to talk about Steinberg. I think that by talking to as many people as possible, 
that helped me understand the big picture and portray it in the article.”

“A lot of sports reporting looks at one game, or one aspect within a game. So to take a step 
back and look at it from a broader angle, and to really talk with so many people, rather than 
just a coach and a couple players, that made a huge difference. I think there was a lot more 
to explore looking at a 20 year trajectory, so when it came down to it, the scope of it made 
it really fun to write.”

“Through my time organizing 
around affordability issues on the 
Ann Arbor campus, I have seen 
how many Michigan opportunities 
are still more difficult for low-
income students and students of 
color to access,” St. Onge said. 
“As Ann Arbor students are 
increasingly likely to come from 
extreme wealth, I have learned 
how the University’s desire to 
provide an uncommon education 
for the common man has been 
complicated. This is why I, and 
other Ann Arbor students, support 
the 1U campaign.”
St. 
Onge 
said 
many 
Ann 
Arbor 
students 
struggle 
with 
affordability, meaning the struggle 
of Flint and Dearborn students 
is linked to that of students 
on 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
campus. 
She 
also 
highlighted 
funding 
disparities among the campuses 
— the University runs on a budget 
surplus and Flint and Dearborn 
students graduate with more debt 
on average than students in Ann 
Arbor.
Additionally, St. Onge spoke 
against the new University felony 
self-disclosure policy. The policy 
requires staff to report all charges 
and convictions of felonies within a 
week and has prompted discussion 

and an open letter calling for the 
policy to be rescinded.
St. Onge said the policy limits 
the opportunities of students and 
faculty and reduces access to certain 
viewpoints and experiences. She 
also said this directly contradicts 
diversity, equity and inclusion at 
the University.
LSA sophomore Mani Samei 
attended the meeting in support 
of UMich Behind Bars — a student 
group 
advocating 
against 
the 
self-disclosure policy — and One 
University. He said it is important 
students make their voices heard 
and presence felt.
“This policy is just one more 
example of the University making 
the active decision to extend the 
prison system into the educational 
system and I think as students it’s 
important we show up to these 
things,” Samei said. “Students are 
taking notice and are noticing the 
regents are making these decisions, 
and it really has no place at the 
University.”
Arifa Javed, a sociology lecturer 
at U-M Dearborn, said she’s given 
a third of her life to the University 
and thanked the regents for the 
salary 
increase 
for 
lecturers. 
However, Javed said some policies 
hurt her and other lecturers, and 
the University needs a change in 
the relationship between the three 
campuses.
She specifically noted policies 
that inhibit her ability to receive 

health care, and shared personal 
experiences that she says show how 
the University does not properly 
support her campus. Javed also 
said majors in her department have 
decreased, decreasing students’ 
opportunities.
“With my 20 years of experience 
at Dearborn, I come before you 
asking for a profound but necessary 
change we need in the relationship 
of our three campuses,” Javed said. 
“Since we are under one president 
and one Board of Regents, I 
would request you to take my 
recommendations and help out the 
students, faculty and staff on all 
three campuses.”
Jono 
Sturt, 
lecturer 
of 
architecture 
in 
the 
Taubman 
College 
of 
Architecture 
and 
Urban Planning, said it is hard 
to live paycheck to paycheck and 
advocated for equal treatment for 
lecturers on all three campuses. 
He said the contract has positively 
impacted his life, his teaching and 
his students’ experience.
Sturt thanked the regents for 
the recent contract, which he said 
allows him to set aside money 
for the future for the first time. 
However, he says there needs to 
be a larger conversation about 
lecturer treatment and the funding 
inequalities across the campuses.
“We understand this needs to 
be the beginning of a much longer 
conversation,” Sturt said. “The 
University of Michigan is a public 

institution and as such, should 
serve the public of this state, not 
just those here in Ann Arbor. Our 
University’s faculty and learners 
at Flint and Dearborn deserve the 
same support I am so grateful to 
enjoy here on this campus.”
Food ethics
Kimberly Daley, a University 
staff member and alum, was one of 
four speakers who spoke about the 
University’s food decisions. Daley, 
who works with the Washtenaw 
Solidarity 
with 
Farmworkers 
organization, 
highlighted 
the 
University’s history of supporting 
fair worker policy and ethical 
purchasing policies, but said the 
University should continue to make 
ethical food choices going forward.
Daley urged the University 
to join the Fair Food Program, 
a partnership ensuring humane 
wages and working conditions for 
the workers who pick fruits and 
vegetables on participating farms. 
She specifically noted the Wendy’s 
debate as a situation of having a 
choice between advocating for fair 
worker treatment or not. She said 
WSF will continue to advocate for 
these issues.
“Our campus community has 
a history of supporting labor 
investments,” Daley said. “The 
University of Michigan also has 
a long commitment to ethical 
purchasing 
commitments 
… 
Expanding this work to the food 
system is critically important 

because with each new corporation 
that joins the Fair Food Program, 
the farms they purchase from join 
this effort that has been proven 
time and time again to eliminate 
abuses.”
WSF member Matthew Hoostal, 
Medical School research fellow, 
shared a report that said the 
University does not make ethical 
food decisions. Hoostal said the 
University should interact with 
the food industry the same way 
it interacts with the garment 
industry, which requires it to avoid 
purchasing from companies that 
practice unethical treatment of 
workers.
WSF member Shane McParland 
added on to Hoostal’s statements 
and asked the University to adopt 
the Fair Food Program policies. 
McParland also mentioned the 
recent Ann Arbor City Council 
resolution to ban Wendy’s and 
other fast food restaurants not 
supportive of the Fair Food 
Program and said the University 
should look at different businesses’ 
policies when deciding which 
have space in the Michigan Union.
“The 
Fair 
Food 
Program 
is 
worker 
driven, 
relies 
on 
workplace-specific 
codes 
of 
conduct, 
worker 
education, 
complaint 
mechanisms, 
comprehensive audits and market 
consequences 
for 
violators,” 
McParland 
said. 
“Vendors’ 
endorsement 
of 
labor 
justice 

should be weighed heavily.”
McParland 
also 
said 
WSF 
asked University President Mark 
Schlissel for a policy favoring 
transparency and endorsing the 
Fair Food Program on campus in 
October 2018. He said a month 
later Schlissel responded saying 
he would share their concerns 
with the president’s Advisory 
Committee on Labor Standards 
and Human Rights. When WSF 
met with the committee chair 
that month, McParland said they 
were told nothing could be done 
without the president’s mandate 
and more research is needed.
Rackham 
student 
Madeline 
Cooke shared similar concerns 
to Hoostal’s and McParland’s. 
She asked University leaders for 
a response and policy in support 
of fair treatment for food workers 
and to join Central Student 
Government and City Council in 
endorsing the Fair Food Program.
“It is clear that students and 
community members care deeply 
about farmworker labor justice 
and, as a community, we want the 
University to take action,” Cooke 
said. “As the largest employer 
in the state of Michigan, what 
this institution does impacts the 
community.”

LSA junior Charlotte Hoppen, 
interim director of education 
for PPE, explained the role 
peer educators play in assisting 
victims of sexual assault both 
on campus and within the Ann 
Arbor community.
“We train all the PPEs on 
how to respond to disclosures 
of 
sexual 
misconduct 
and 
sexual assault and on how to 
provide resources in the campus 
community and around the 
community 
of 
Ann 
Arbor,” 
Hoppen said. “We train them 
to provide presentations on 
consent, 
sexual 
misconduct, 
responding to disclosures and 
resources for all new member 
classes 
in 
the 
Panhellenic 
community.”
Hoppen went on to discuss 

why having resources like PPE is 
crucial to empowering women, 
especially within the Greek life 
community.
“Greek life, in particular, is 
an at-risk group on campus,” 
she 
said. 
“10.3 
percent 
of 
(on-campus rapes) take place 
in fraternity houses … so it’s 
especially important that we 
are empowering women to not 
only to be in safe situations and 
help others in need, but also to 
work and advocate on behalf of 
themselves.”
Recently, the University of 
Michigan announced a revision 
to the student sexual misconduct 
policy, wherein students must 
take 
part 
in 
an 
in-person 
meeting between the accuser, 
the accused and any witnesses 
involved if requested to do so. 
The policy revision follows a 
recent U.S. Sixth Circuit Court 
of Appeals ruling, in which 

public universities “must give 
the accused student or his agent 
an opportunity to cross-examine 
the accuser.”
A student, who asked to 
remain anonymous for privacy 
reasons, 
reflected 
on 
the 
implications the policy revision 
may have on students going 
through the process of reporting 
misconduct.
“In the future, I don’t see 
this policy doing any good for 
survivors,” she said. “What they 
don’t realize is, if survivors have 
to sit in the same room as their 
perpetrator and be questioned 
by them, how traumatizing that 
can be. Reporting as a whole is 
traumatizing in and of itself, 
and seeing the person is so 
awful they’re trying to process 
something already, and seeing 
the person’s face can take so 
much away from you.”
LSA freshman Cammie Dalton 

discussed how events like the 
Speak Out can assist individuals 
in their healing process.
“It’s really important to listen 
to people’s stories and emphasize 
that you believe people’s stories,” 
Dalton said. “It’s important to 
feel like you can come forward, 
because it’s such a big step of 
recovery.”
Additionally, she discussed 
how the aura of acceptance and 
affirmation permeating the event 
allowed for an environment 
conducive to emotional healing.
“Events like this are necessary 
because of the setting,” she said. 
“For people to feel comfortable, 
it depends on who they are 
around. If they get a vibe that 
people are going to be accepting 
and actually be listening — not 
just present — events like this 
will be really helpful for their 
recovery.”

“I 
am 
proud 
of 
the 
great 
events, 
community 
collaborations, 
programming 
and 
park 
improvements 
that 
our 
board 
of 
directors 
and 
volunteers have facilitated in 
the past few years,” Meisler 
said. “I look forward to more 
success for the best public 
skatepark in the Midwest 
under the leadership of the 
new president and founding 
board member of Friends of 
the Ann Arbor Skatepark, 
Nina Juergens.”
Business 
junior 
Jordan Stanton has been 
skateboarding 
since 
he 
was 14. In Ann Arbor, he’s 
familiar 
with 
the 
skate 
shop scene. But he grew 
up in New York, where 
many skateparks have tried 
producing skate programs, 
specifically for girls, since 
he started skating seven 
years ago.
“I 
have 
seen 
a 

definite increase in girls 
skateboarding 
since 
I 
started seven years ago,” 
Stanton said. “Specifically 
in New York, there’s been 
momentum for a while, but 
I believe it usually takes 
longer for that to spread to 
the Midwest.”
Though 
Juergens 
has 
many long-term goals on her 
agenda, she emphasized in 
a press release that her goal 
from the beginning of her 
involvement in the skatepark 
was to increase girls’ interest 
in skating and to allow them 
to feel included in the Ann 
Arbor skating community.
“The 
goal 
from 
day 
one was to have a larger 
presence of girls and women 
skateboarding 
and 
using 
skateparks,” Juergens said. 
“We’ve run the All Girls 
Skate 
instruction 
free 
for participants since the 
opening of the park, and 
we’ve 
had 
professional 
skateboarders 
such 
as 
Samarria 
Brevard, 
Nora 
Vasconcellos 
and 
Jordyn 
Barratt come to be a part of 
the All Girls Skate program.”

Currently, 
Michigan 
law 
only covers the restrictions 
on 
texting 
while 
driving. 
Reactions to the bill have been 
positive from campus leaders 
on both sides of the political 
aisle.
In an email interview with 

The Daily, Public Policy senior 
Katie Kelly, communications 
director for the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
lauded 
the 
initiative 
for 
improving 
the 
safety 
of 
everyone on the roads and 
commended 
Whitmer 
for 
supporting it.
“Governor 
Whitmer’s 
initiative to pass a bill for 
hands-free driving in Michigan 
will help improve the safety 
of everyone on the roads,” 
Kelly wrote. “Be it texting 
while 
driving 
or 
scrolling 
through social media, looking 
at a screen while driving 
drastically 
increases 
your 
chances of an accident.”
Notably, the new bill does 
not restrict adult Michigan 
drivers 
from 
talking 
and 
listening on their phones while 
driving. Kelly also praised this 
part of the bill, framing it as 
a smart decision that avoids 
over-restricting 
drivers 
on 
what they are able to do while 
driving.
“The bill still allows for 
cell phone use through voice 
operated methods so no one 
will miss any crucial calls while 
driving,” Kelly said. “This bill 
is meant to ensure the safety of 
the citizens of Michigan, and I 
commend Governor Whitmer 
for supporting it.”
Likewise, Kinesiology junior 
Jackson Schleuning, treasurer 
of the University’s chapter 
of College Republicans, also 
had a very positive reaction, 

describing road safety as a 
shared interest for everyone.
“No matter if you are a man 
or a woman, black or white, 
gay or straight, everybody 
uses these roads and when 
you make the decision to drive 
distracted, you are putting 
everybody at risk,” Schleuning 
said.
Additionally, 
Schleuning 
also described a personal loss 
he experienced because of 
distracted driving.
“When (Whitmer) initially 
touched on the hands-free 
part, one of the guests in her 
gallery was a family member 
of someone who was killed 
by a distracted driver and 
who was actually one of my 
best friends,” he said. “He 
was traveling about 50 miles 
an hour when he had to slow 
down because there was traffic 
coming on. The woman driving 
behind him did not realize 
that and hit him from behind, 
sending him across the median 
where a tractor-trailer hit him 
right on.”
LSA freshman Rina McClain 
also expressed approval of 
the new bill, even casting it as 
somewhat of an inevitability.
“I guess I would that think 
this would happen sooner or 
later just because any of the 
stuff online can be distracting 
while driving,” she said. “It 
doesn’t really surprise me — 
it makes sense that a bill is 
trying to be passed to expand 
restrictions.”
McClain also commented on 
the impact that this bill would 
have on University students 
who drive, bringing up their 
frequency of phone usage.
“Anyone 
from 
this 
generation… are so dependent 
on their phones,” McClain 
said. “If you’re addicted to 
your phone, then it’s going to 
be a problem for you, especially 
with social media.”

Currently, 
environmental 
policy 
works 
under 
risk 
mitigation 
which 
requires 
polluters 
to 
limit 
human 
exposure to pollutants rather 
than cleaning up the entirety of 
the pollution.
Irwin said this has caused 
more complications than solved 
problems. To highlight this, 
Irwin cited the Gelman lawsuit 
over the contamination of an 
Ann Arbor water supply.
“There was a company on 
the west side of Ann Arbor that 
polluted an aquifer under Ann 
Arbor and because the law only 
requires risk mitigation, the 
company was able to point to the 
fact that people living on top of 
that aquifer were drinking city 
water and because they weren’t 

actually exposed to that city 
water, they shouldn’t have to 
clean it up,” Irwin said.
The aquifer was sectioned 
off as a prohibition zone, or an 
area of natural resources that is 
sealed off for any future use due 
to its contamination.
Irwin 
said 
this 
bill 
is 
necessary for the health of 
Michigan 
residents, 
both 
present and future.
“We’re 
talking 
about 
how 
much 
of 
these 
toxic 
chemicals we’re going to leave 
in the ground and that has a 
translation to the number of 
people in the future who are 
going to be hurt as a result of 
this decision,” Irwin said.
Rabhi acknowledged this bill 
will not be easy to pass because 
the Michigan legislature is still 
controlled by Republicans.
“I 
think 
that 
there 
are 
significant hurdles,” Rabhi said. 
“Corporate polluters still have 

significant allies in the House 
with the Republican majority.”
Sometimes 
lawmakers 
forget 
residents 
when 
making decisions that benefit 
corporations, Irwin added.
“Sometimes in Lansing, I 
think it’s really easy to obscure 
the connection between the 
decisions we’re making to how 
much pollution is allowed and 
the very real cancers and other 
health problems people get as a 
result of these decisions,” Irwin 
said.
In Irwin’s point of view, 
current laws are rewarding 
companies that do not spend 
extra expenses on practicing 
cleaner operations.
“The additional hazard of 
allowing polluters to be let off 
the hook is that you have a whole 
universe 
of 
good 
corporate 
citizens out there, companies 
that are doing the right thing,” 
Irwin said. “Companies that are 

spending money to make sure 
that their operations are more 
sustainable and more in line 
with the public interest and are 
protective of public health.”
The Daily reached out to the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans, but they were 
unable to comment in time for 
publication. 
Katie Kelly, communications 
director of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats, believes this bill 
will 
help 
both 
Michigan’s 
environment and population.
“I 
think 
the 
new 
bills 
introduced by Representative 
Rabhi and Senator Irwin are 
a great step forward for our 
community,” Kelly wrote in an 
email interview with The Daily. 
“If corporations are dumping 
pollutants into our environment 
it should be their job to clean 
it up… . If this bill passes, I 
believe it will help clean up the

I

t’s a Friday night in Ann 
Arbor and the promise of 
the weekend has students 

flocking to Main Street bars 
and clubs to engage in the great 
American pastime of intoxication. 
But 
with 
an 
undergraduate 

population of more than 29,000, 
some of these revelers are bound to 
be underage. In line, Zach, aged 18, 
fumbles for something in his pocket 
when he reaches the bouncer.

Thirty minutes later, Zach is 

at the bar ordering his fifth shot 
of tequila before stumbling home. 
This scenario is made possible 
by a simple invention: the fake 
ID. Couple this technology with 
a tendency for underage binge-
drinking and you have a potentially 
dangerous cocktail for the social 
landscape of American college 
towns.

As a freshman new to the 

social scene of Ann Arbor, I set off 
across campus to talk to students. 
First, I wanted to learn more about 
fake IDs and how they texture 
the experiences of students at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan. 

Second, I wanted to examine the 
particularly American brand of 
binge-drinking that these fake IDs 
afford to underage drinkers and the 
alternative drinking cultures found 
around the world. I was convinced 
these trends were two symptoms 
of the same disease, and that by 
finding the heart of the issue, young 
Americans could begin to develop 
a culture with more safe and 
responsible drinking habits.

The fake ID is an expanding 

American personality (touted in 
popular songs and joked about 
in blockbuster movies) with an 
entire 
underground 
economy. 

The 
Northwestern 
Business 

Review writes, “The quality of 
the product varies due to minute 
changes in the polyvinyl chloride, 
spectrophotometer 
matched 

ink and luminescent holograms. 
Up-front 
costs 
including 
the 

printer and templates can run up 
to $2000 alone.” I spoke to some 
students on campus to see if these 
popular anecdotes were consistent 
with their experiences. First, I 
interviewed a student who had just 
ordered their first fake ID ever:

MILES: How did you get in 

contact with the maker?

STUDENT 1: My friend asked 

me if I needed one and I said, “Yes, 
I do.”

MILES: How much did you 

pay?

STUDENT 1: $80. I estimate 

there are about 30 people in my 
order, which makes it cheaper.

MILES: Why are you getting it 

now?

STUDENT 1: In high school, 

the local liquor store would sell us 
alcohol even if we didn’t have a fake. 
In Ann Arbor, you need one to go 
out with friends to bars.

MILES: Are you nervous about 

purchasing it and using it?

STUDENT 1: Normally I would 

be, but the guy who I’m buying it 
from does them very routinely and I 
know people who have gotten fakes 
from him before. Using it, yeah … it 
seems kind of sketch.

Next, I spoke to a student 

from the undergraduate class of 
2020 who told me a story about 

purchasing a fake ID:

“When we were in high school, 

you couldn’t get IDs online. You 
had to get them from people. 
We had a car to go get it and we 
texted this shady-ass dude all our 
personal info. It was $150 an ID. 
We brought $300 cash and met this 
dude at midnight in an abandoned 
warehouse parking lot near (San 
Francisco Bay Area). Dude rolls up 
in a black Suburban, pulls in behind 
us, blocks us in and gets out of the 
car with a pit bull.”

After an initial frightening 

episode, the high schoolers gave 
him an envelope with money and 
drove home. Phony Tony, the 
maker of the IDs, remains a local 
legend in the Bay Area, but this 
story articulates the potentially 
dangerous situations students are 
involving themselves in to bypass 
21+ American drinking laws.

Finally, I spoke to not a supplier 

of fake IDs, but a liaison between 
customers and makers. This person 
characterized their position as 
“organizing orders (of fake IDs)” 
and said that they had about 10 
customers in Ann Arbor at one 
point. Most of their fake IDs were 
modeled off of real East Coast IDs.

So, what’s the solution to this 

potentially dangerous scheme? 
An article in the U.S. National 
Library of Medicine titled, “Will 
Increasing Alcohol Availability 
By Lowering the Minimum Legal 
Drinking Age Decrease Drinking 
and 
Related 
Consequences 

Among Youths?” questions the 
theory that drinking laws should 
be made more lenient to cultivate 
responsible 
drinking 
culture. 

Proponents of this idea argue 
that the 21-and-over drinking age 
stigmatizes alcohol consumption 
to such a degree that young 
Americans are learning to drink 
in unsupervised spaces and that 
more permissive legislation would 
allow these underage drinkers 
to learn from more responsible, 
societally-normalized 
sources. 

After all, Europe has a safer 
drinking culture with its younger 
age drinking laws, right? In the 
popular 
imagination, 
French 

12-year-olds are sipping wine 
with their parents at dinner and 
are learning to drink responsibly 
— it’s America that’s obsessed 
with taking shots and “blacking 
out.”

This, however, is not the case. 

“If you look at the data, there’s no 
evidence to support the idea that 
Europe, in general, has a safer 
drinking culture than the US … 
European teens ages 15 to 19 tend 
to report greater levels of binge 
drinking than American teens,” 
writes German Lopez of Vox. 
When looking at the percent of 

15 and 16-year-olds who report 
being drunk in the last month, 
Denmark, the U.K. and Austria 
are the most severe with 49, 33 and 
31 percent respectively. The U.S. 
by contrast, is on par with Latvia 
at 18 percent. Furthermore, nearly 
all available evidence suggests 
that stricter alcohol policies can 
reduce deaths, and another article 
by the U.S. National Library of 
Medicine titled “Case closed: 
research evidence on the positive 
public health impact of the age 
21 minimum legal drinking age 
in the United States” puts this 
misconception to rest.

So it seems that a 21-and-over 

drinking age is safer, but maybe 
it’s less about the actual age and 
more about the cultural attitudes 
and behaviors toward drinking. 
There’s an unspoken acceptance 
that 
underage 
drinking 
will 

happen, especially in colleges, 
and yet the legal angle doesn’t 
reflect this. “Drinking alcohol has 
become a rite of passage for some 
young people in this country, and 
many students come to college 
having learned to drink during 
their high school years,” says the 
University Health Service.

And yet, besides special cases 

of medical amnesty, the looming 
threat of receiving a Minor in 
Possession violation, which entails 
a $250 fine to the 15th District 
Court, 
often 
disincentivizes 

underage drinkers to seek help 
from authorities. Here, perhaps, 
is where the opportunity to learn 
from international practices truly 
lies.

Canadian universities have 

begun 
to 
implement 
“drunk 

tanks,” or spaces for intoxicated 
underage drinkers to recover 
safely and without the threat of 
punishment. The University of 
Guelph’s campus alcohol recovery 
room and the University of 
Calgary’s post-alcohol support 
space solve the stigma issue and 
potentially save lives. CARR 
is a “six-bed space equipped 
with buckets that opened last 
year inside a campus residence 
building,” while PASS is “staffed 
by 
both 
volunteers 
and 
a 

registered nurse.”

A 
coupling 
of 
America’s 

safer, 
21-and-over 
drinking 

laws and Canada’s more lenient 
enforcement 
could 
decrease 

avoidable 
underage 
drinking 

accidents and save the lives of 
young college students. As for the 
prevalence of fake IDs, it’s likely 
that an underground industry 
like this will continue to thrive, 
especially as new technology 
develops that further blurs the line 
between real and fake for alcohol-
serving establishments. And their 
readiness 
proves 
dangerous, 

as it enables students to more 
easily engage in binge drinking. 
If something’s to be done, it’s 
to ensure young Americans are 
protected by the safest laws and 
they have the proper resources to 
reach out when someone pushes 
them too far.

Soccer : The geopolitical game

O

n 
May 
13, 
2012, 

Manchester City Football 
Club won the English 

Premier League title in one of the 
most dramatic finishes in sports 
history. Down 2-1 to Queens Park 
Rangers on the final day of the 
season, Manchester City needed a 
win to overtake crosstown rivals 
Manchester 
United, 
something 

that they accomplished through 
goals in the 92nd and 94th minutes. 
For City fans, the championship 
represented 
the 
glorious 

conclusion to a momentous rise 
from irrelevance to stardom — the 
club had spent years bouncing 
between the top two divisions of 
English soccer, and hadn’t won 
England’s top league title since 
1968. While City fans were ecstatic, 
for club owner Mansour bin 
Zayed Al Nahyan, this was just the 
beginning.

Four years earlier, in 2008, 

Manchester City was coming off 
a decent — but unremarkable — 
campaign, having finished 9th in 
the Premier League. However, the 
club’s owner, former Thai Prime 
Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, had 
become embroiled in a series of 
political scandals, which had led to 
the freezing of his bank accounts. 
Shinawatra, desperately needing to 
offload the team, sold it to Mansour, 
deputy prime minister of the 
United Arab Emirates and Emirati 
businessman, and his private equity 
company, Abu Dhabi United Group.

Mansour, whose family has an 

estimated net worth of well over $1 
billion, made it clear immediately 
he wasn’t there just for show — 
he intended to build an elite club, 
whatever the cost might be. Since 
taking ownership of the club, 
Mansour has followed through: 
City has spent £1.4 billion, won 
three Premier League titles, and 
has become one of the biggest clubs 

in Europe. But this begs a question 
— why would a Middle Eastern 
investor sink billions of pounds 
into a soccer club based thousands 
of miles away from Abu Dhabi in 
Manchester, England?

Historically, sports have served 

as a valuable asset for promoting 
“soft power” — a mechanism by 
which countries gain international 
standing not through brute force 
or economic might, but rather 
by seeming attractive to foreign 
states and citizens through cultural 
appeals. Traditionally, this was 
done through hosting or doing well 
in either the Olympic Games or the 

World Cup — the two truly global 
sporting events. However, as the 
Premier League developed into a 
worldwide phenomenon, Mansour 
has been able to harness it as a tool 
for soft power.

For Mansour and his nation, 

the United Arab Emirates, club 
ownership isn’t only a financial 
investment, but also a cultural and 
political one. Mansour is a member 
of the UAE’s elite economic and 
political class, which are highly 
intertwined thanks to the UAE’s 
oligarchical 
government. 
In 

addition to being the owner of 
Abu Dhabi United, Mansour is the 
half-brother of the UAE’s current 
president and is the chair of the 
ministerial council for services and 

Emirates Investment Authority.

Historically, the UAE has not 

been a particularly powerful nation 
— it only gained independence 
in 1971. However, thanks to the 
discovery of (some) oil, the creation 
of favorable incentives for foreign 
corporations, and an increase in 
tourism, the country — especially 
the cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai 
— has enticed the blossoming 
of glamorous metropolises over 
the past 15 years. In coordination 
with the UAE’s sudden increase 
in wealth, it makes sense the 
country would want to promote 
itself internationally and sports 
ownership is an excellent way to 
accomplish that.

Mansour and Abu Dhabi United 

Group are, in many ways, the UAE’s 
representatives to the West. Their 
philosophy seems quite simple: In 
order to create a positive reputation 
in the West, they must associate 
themselves with elite teams in the 
world’s most popular sport. 

However, the UAE’s sports-

based rebranding project is far 
from the wholesome, educational 
endeavor it claims to be. Rather, 
it 
is 
highly 
problematic 
and 

disingenuous. 
Mansour 
may 

promote the UAE as a glamorous, 
exotic country whose ownership 
represents the nation’s own success 
and positivity, but that simply isn’t 
true. As City’s obscenely expensive 
squad runs circles around their 
Premier League opponents, there 
are many things going on back 
in the UAE that Mansour would 
probably prefer weren’t mentioned.

Solve dangerous drinking 

N

one of us will forget 
the polar vortex that 
passed through Ann 

Arbor in January 2019. Almost 
everything was shut down 
and almost everyone spent 
time taking advantage of the 
curiosities this rare weather 
phenomenon 
offered. 
We 

joked about how long we 
would last outside, willingly 
threw water only to watch 
it instantly freeze in the 
air before drifting to the 
ground and counted how 
many seconds would pass 
before our shower hair froze 
when we stepped outside. 
We 
watched 
it 
happen 

through the windows of our 
rooms, felt utter joy when all 
academic obligations were 
called off and the rest was 
history to us.

Meanwhile, 
at 
least 
21 

deaths, as well as dozens of 
frostbite injuries occurred 
across the Midwest due to 
weather-related 
incidents 

brought upon by the polar 
vortex. 
These 
tragedies 

were most common for the 
homeless, 
senior 
citizens 

and 
people 
whose 
access 

to heat was not consistent 
or 
reliable. 
Though 
not 

necessarily a bloody, graphic 
disaster, it’s clear that the 
brief displacement of Arctic 
temperatures to our region 
of the country was enough 
to punish those who were 
unprepared. What remains 
in question is whether their 
incapability 
to 
prepare 

was their fault or not, and 
what could have been done 
if they were not in such 
disadvantaged positions to 
begin with.

I vividly remember the 

late fall of 2018. It was a ripe 
part in my first semester at 
the University of Michigan, 
a 
blend 
of 
addressing 

academic responsibilities and 
responding to the desires I 
had to explore this campus 
and to explore myself. The 
energy of the campus was 
refreshing and vibrant. Our 
football team had achieved a 
massive victory against our 
rivals and would go on to 
defeat another on one of the 
colder days of the season. We 
stressed about exams and 
de-stressed over the weekend, 
tuning into the fluctuations 
of our student lives and living 
in what would come to feel 

like the only world we knew.

During this time, at least 77 

deaths, as well as hundreds 
of missing persons reports, 
occurred as a result of the 
blazing wildfires that passed 
through regions of California. 
The 
slow 
obliteration 
of 

residences and commercial 
buildings continued by the 
thousands, not to mention the 
destruction of 240,000 acres 
of land among various regions, 
including Los Angeles and 
Malibu. In the end, not even 
the wealthy were safe from 
the 
physical 
damage 
and 

emotional trauma that our 
environment brought upon us 
as its behaviors momentarily 
became different than what 

we were used to. While these 
wildfires have emulated what 
the end of times could be 
like on a microscopic scale, 
I know this is not yet the 
true end. The end will have 
infinite power against all of 
us, but we have to recognize 
that there is still some power 
that remains in our hands.

What 
concerned 
me 

the most at the end of last 
summer was starting classes 
at the University. The end of 
August was both a swell of 
excitement and a melancholy 
farewell to my childhood. It 
felt like an onward push into 
the new world — whether 
I was prepared for it or 
not. This time marked the 
beginning of my quest to 
find my people, to be who 
I wanted to be, to connect 
with those who had similar 
interests to mine and to 
enjoy myself in the process. I 
embraced the big change and 
was swept away by the uproar 
of excitement that came with 
the new school year, relishing 
in the newfound freedom.

In 
the 
meantime, 
the 

news was acknowledging the 
anniversary 
of 
Hurricane 

Maria, 
a 
natural 
disaster 

that caused a total of 2,975 
deaths in the U.S. territory 
Puerto Rico in September 
2017. While this hurricane 
was considered as the worst 
recorded natural disaster in 
the Caribbean, it’s also worth 
noting that the American 
citizens in Puerto Rico lived 
in disadvantaged conditions 
with a stigma that prevented 
any significant benefits from 
coming their way even before 
they were tormented by this 
natural disaster. Our nation’s 
response to this disaster was 
a disgrace, but why?

I 
believe 
that 
our 

government’s response was 
disgraceful 
because 
what 

people in power today lack 
is compassion; what modern 
society lacks is compassion. 
As college students, we are 
too invested in our own lives 
and self-fulfillment, thinking 
about where we are going to 
go without thinking about if 
there will even be a place to go 
as a result of our actions — or 
lack thereof. We don’t think 
enough about the people who 
are suffering as a result of our 
prospering, who are living in 
conditions that we can’t even 
imagine and who recognize 
that privilege is a gift while 
we complain ungratefully. It 
pains me when some don’t 
realize that it doesn’t have 
to be this way, that some are 
reluctant to help others out 
of fear of causing their own 
disadvantage and that some 
are unwilling to recognize 
the 
humanity 
in 
shared 

prosperity.

In our defense, we are 

almost required to be fully 
invested in our own lives. 
We carry our own futures 
by addressing the countless 
responsibilities that are set 
upon us every day. Even so, I 
think we all need an attitude 
check. The way that we feel 
around people who are not 
like us is something that we 
can control and something 
that more people have to be 
aware of. In the same way, 
we have to recognize that our 
environment 
suffers 
from 

our apathy just as people do 
and that we have to act in 
consideration 
of 
everyone 

and everything if we don’t 
want to bring the end upon 
ourselves.

A few months ago, a friend 
sent me a quote by Sandra 
Cisneros: “I’m married to my 
writing, and he can be brutal 
but he never strays.” Writing 
was my first love. When my 
friend sent me this, though, 
I hadn’t written anything in 
months. Every time I sat down 
to write, there seemed to be 
a block. It was visceral — I 
could feel it in my chest. It was 
something close to anxiety, a 
deep-rooted resistance to sit 
down and write.
I’d 
met 
this 
friend 
two 
summers ago at a 
writing workshop 
in New York City. 
I was still writing 
for 
fun 
then, 
unrestrained 
by 
the “right format” 
or “right structure” 
or “right way to say 
the 
thing 
you’re 
trying desperately 
to say, and you 
finally say it, but 
no, that’s the wrong way to say 
it. Change it.” She was writing 
for fun, too, but she also took 
herself seriously — something 
I didn’t do. I didn’t want to 
take myself seriously. I didn’t 
want to think about writing 
for 
publication 
or 
finding 
an agent or fighting to the 
death for an internship at the 
New Yorker. I loved writing, 
probably more than anything. 
I thought I was good at it. I 
had my style and my way of 
saying things and, generally, 
people liked it. My writing was 
creative 
and 
unrestrained. 
It came naturally to me. One 
day I’d publish a book and 
it’d do really well, but for the 
present, I’d just keep calling 
myself a writer until I became 
a real writer, and everything 

would fall into place.
I learned how to write 
for 
publication 
at 
the 
aforementioned 
workshop, 
and that’s where everything 
fell apart. I became consumed 
with readability, with concise 
sentences, 
with 
perfecting 
punctuation 
and 
structure 
and flow, with am I saying too 
much here? Writing became 
agonizing. A cycle had arisen. 
I couldn’t type a sentence 
without immediately erasing 
it, typing it again, erasing it 
again. I was obsessed with the 
“right” way to write. When I 

finished a piece, I’d ask myself: 
Would Harper’s or the New 
Yorker or the New York Times 
publish this? And if the answer 
was no (which it always was) 
I’d erase everything and start 
over again.
This was exhausting. My 
perfectionism took hold of 
my creativity — I couldn’t 
even journal anymore. I can’t 
remember when I stopped 
writing completely, but I did.
My 
friend 
is 
currently 
working 
on 
her 
creative 
writing 
thesis 
at 
Emory. 
She’s writing a collection of 
personal essays — our mutual 
favorite genre. I think of 
this often. I was inexplicably 
envious of her at first. I miss 
writing. I wish I could do that. 
But I can’t. It won’t be good 

enough.
After 
many 
repetitions, 
this 
thought 
had 
become 
something of a mantra. My 
pieces 
for 
the 
workshop 
classes were half-hearted, and 
I’d sweat before I sent them to 
my classmates. I was falling 
out of love with writing — in 
fact, I hated it.
On 
Sunday, 
I 
revisited 
journals that I keep on a 
bookshelf in my apartment 
but never touch. I re-read 
my 
uninhibited 
writing 
from months and years ago. 
I remembered, for the first 
time 
in 
a 
long 
time, 
how 
much 
writing means to 
me, how much of 
my identity and my 
head and my heart 
that it holds. I fell 
back in love with 
the thing I’d loved 
first. So I sat down 
and wrote like I 
hadn’t written in 
a very long time. 
There 
were 
no 
rules.
The 
notion 
of 
being in love with your art 
form resonates across genres. 
Falling out of love with your 
art form resonates, too. Many 
of my artist friends have 
dropped out of art school, 
many of my musician friends 
out of music school. When 
your art form becomes too 
restricted, too serious, too 
taught, you fall out of love 
with it. When you remember 
that your art form is you – that 
there are no rules, that there 
is nothing to be taught beyond 
what you can teach yourself 
through art – you fall back in 
love. And it’s beautiful.
It takes a lot to remind 
myself that I can still be 
married to my writing, but he 
doesn’t have to be brutal. And 
he’ll never stray.

On loving your art form

Eva Hendricks, the lead singer of Charly 
Bliss, tells me over the phone that she 
recently went out to do karaoke — I tell 
her I already know, because I watched her 
performance of the Spice Girls’s “Wannabe” 
over Instagram live. It was around the same 
time as the release of lead single “Capacity” 
from Charly Bliss’s forthcoming album 
Young Enough. Hendricks goes on to say 
that she hates karaoke and, as a side note, 
that she doesn’t remember broadcasting 
herself.
“I am someone 
who hates karaoke 
— not only do I hate 
it, I am, like, afraid 
of it,” Hendricks 
said.
“My 
sister-
in-law, Kathy, is 
obsessed 
with 
karaoke. The same 
day that ‘Capacity’ 
came out, she got 
a huge promotion 
at work.” There 
was 
only 
one 
way to celebrate, 
according 
to 
Hendrick’s sister-
in-law: karaoke.
Between 
singing lead vocals 
and hating karaoke, there is a friction. 
Both in musical style and as a performer, 
Hendricks commands and pushes forth. 
Her voice, elastic, resonant and feminine, 
is matched by her brio. On Guppy, Charly 
Bliss’s debut album, she shrieks, she coos, 
she belts. On stage, Hendricks moves like 
she’s working something out from the very 
depths of her spirit, like those lyrics she 
and bandmates Spencer Fox, Dan Shure 
and Sam Hendricks have been singing for 
years bear original and new weights. In 
a word? Dynamic. Hearing that karaoke 
isn’t her forte, then, maybe isn’t a surprise. 
Maybe there’s not enough at stake with a 
prerecorded track you didn’t write yourself.
“I must say it is a really great way to 
celebrate and really like, I’m someone 
who loves dancing so much, but I’m not 
someone who would go to (she pauses for 
emphasis) the club. I don’t even know what 
that would look like for me,” Hendricks 
said. She says all of this with good humor 
and tacit acknowledgement of her own 

contradictions. Sociable, fun and energetic, 
yes, but on her own terms.
“I went to NYU and my first night 
living in New York, my friends and I paid 
a $20 cover to go to a shitty, gross club,” 
Hendricks said. “We accepted shots from 
a stranger and danced on a table and that 
was the last time I ever went to (she pauses 
briefly, again, for emphasis) a club. But, that 
being said, if you’re someone who loves to 
dance, and you don’t like to go to the club, 
really, the only time I get to dance is if 
someone in my life gets married, and so like, 
I think that the great thing about karaoke is 
that you can kind of go nuts and satisfy that 
craving without being surrounded by scary 
strangers.”
“Or 
getting 
married,” 
I 
suggest.
She 
laughs. 
“Yeah, or being 
like, 
please 
somebody 
get 
married, I need to 
have a cathartic 
freak out in front of 
all of my relatives.”
The portrait of 
Hendricks 
that 
Guppy paints isn’t 
that far from the 
person I’m talking 
to over the phone. 
Guppy is a sketch 
of maturation and 
the many, many 
attempts it takes to get what you want 
from the world, especially in love. Striving 
(and failing) like this on the record takes 
countless forms: giving yourself over to 
something without heed, settling for less, 
internalizing conflict so you can try to fix it 
instead of letting it fester. And, through all 
of it, realizing that sometimes life can seem 
like blow after blow. Hendricks knows that 
part of life is taking what the world gives 
you and cobbling it into something that 
resembles your desires. Using karaoke as 
an outlet for dancing as well as singing fits 
right into the scheme.
Hendricks recognizes the difficulty in 
answering that vast question: How do I 
get what I want in the constraints of my 
life? Songs like “Scare U” approach writing 
these answers directly: “I don’t wanna 
scare you / I don’t wanna share you.” A 
few others, like “Westermarck,” are drawn 
from Hendricks’s own experience: “From 
across your room I saw / Second cousins 
kissing on the lawn / We will never speak 

again.”
“The thing about pop music is that, I 
think it’s actually the hardest music to write 
because it has to sound deceptively simple,” 
Hendricks said. “Writing in a way that 
sounds effortless and comes across as being 
effortless is really difficult.” Hendricks gets 
at a point for which many pop songwriters, 
especially those that are women, are 
harangued: the supposed “mindlessness” 
of lyrics about love. There is often an 
implicit sexism in this criticism, one that 
tries to pick on women as overemotional, 
sentimental and fickle. Sure, love is a well 
explored topic in art and music, but does 
anyone ever really get tired of finding the 
right song for that loving moment?
“When people criticize artists like Taylor 
Swift, like oh it’s just crap, she’s writing 
about her relationships,” Hendricks said, 
“It is actually so difficult to write lyrics that 
are communicative and evocative and feel 
as though, oh my God, this person must 
have read my diary because I have felt 
exactly this way before.”
Part of what makes Guppy such a strong 
album are the band’s efforts to write lyrics 
that are just that expressive. “DQ” is a track 
that combines the worry of wasted youth 
with that dirty, shameful jealousy that 
spikes when somebody steals the attention 
of a lover: “I laughed when your dog died, / 
It is cruel, but it’s true, / Take me back, kiss 
my soft side, / Does he love me most now 
that his dog is toast?”
At the same time, the members of Charly 
Bliss aren’t just writing songs that express 
things directly. The opening track on 
Guppy, “Percolator,” is a clear parody of the 
“overemotional songwriter” trope: “I cry 
all the time, I think that it’s cool / I’m in 
touch with my feelings.” What Hendricks 
does on this track, and a couple others, is 
a classic method to kill a feeling: Act it out 
with exaggeration. The sensation becomes 
small, almost comical in comparison to the 
set of new clothes you just dressed it in.
“I think that’s because pop music makes 
me feel strong,” Hendricks said. “It makes 
me feel invincible, and I kind of needed 
that shield in order to write lyrics that felt 
so vulnerable ... I think in a way, and I don’t 
think I realized this when we were writing 
(Young Enough), but a lot of the songs that 
are filled with darkest content are the ones 
that sound like bangers on the album.”
Pop music and conjured invincibility go 
hand in hand. Take Robyn’s “Dancing On 
My Own” or “Call Your Girlfriend.” Take 
Beyonce’s “Crazy in Love” or, to take a 
turn, the entirety of Lemonade. Take Amy 

Winehouse’s “Rehab,” Bruce Springsteen’s 
“Born to Run,” Leonard Cohen’s now-
standard “Hallelujah.” I’ll even be generous 
and include The 1975’s “It’s Not Living (If 
It’s Not With You).” Pop music doesn’t 
have to mean “synth,” “dance,” “club” or 
“femininity,” as audiences often assume. 
Think pop as in popular, for the people, 
accessible. The mission of a pop song, under 
this definition, is to get to that just-read-
my-diary feeling without being so broad 
that the song collapses under the weight of 
itself.
It is easy, though, to 
get caught in the mire of 
feeling, and never work 
it out. “I am someone 
who loves young adult 
TV, 
so 
that 
means 
that I love difficult 
relationships, you know, 
Buffy and Angel, the 
‘Twilight’ series, ‘The 
OC,’” Hendricks said. “I 
love all that stuff, and I 
think I really believed 
in a way, at a certain 
moment in my life, 
that means it’s worth 
fighting for, if it’s so 
hard and this person 
is really pushing you. 
And it can mean that, it 
also can just mean that 
you and another person 
really love each other 
a lot but are just never 
going to be able to give 
the other person what 
they need.”
Her comment turns 
my attention to my own relationships — how 
they come together, then apart. There are 
times that feel meaningful, but are nothing 
more than an intersection of two lives over 
one summer. Other times that lead to “just 
being friends,” and then feeling like a toy 
when they tease you for wanting more. And 
then, those times where it’s attraction, but 
neither is scratching the other in the right 
places to make it go anywhere.
“I think on Guppy,” Hendricks said. 
“I felt so frustrated about that, whereas 
on this album, you know what, that’s not 
the worst experience you can have with 
another person. That’s sweet, something 
that everyone goes through, there’s a 
universality to that experience. And it 
doesn’t have to be horrible, and you can 
kind of look back on it and laugh and be 
like I remember what it felt like. And in 

a way like that was kind of really sweet, 
that we both really believed that. While 
also recognizing I’m so happy that I don’t 
believe that anymore. I’m at a place where 
I know that I deserve something different 
and that I want something different and 
that something different doesn’t feel boring 
or flat to me.”
That something different came sonically, 
too. “Capacity” begins with a slick beat 
and synthline, complete with other synth 
notes and a crescendoing bridge with the 
massive, soaring chords of 
a power ballad. “No matter 
what it was going to be a 
transitional record and we 
wanted to honor that. That 
being said, I think that the 
songs that are more rock 
leaning, I still feel that we 
really pushed ourselves, 
and they don’t to me they 
sound like they could have 
been on Guppy, which is 
important to us as well,” 
Hendricks said.
“With 
pushing 
ourselves to a new sound, 
it 
wasn’t 
necessarily 
something that we were 
totally conscious of, like 
oh, we were a rock band, 
and now we’re a pop 
band,” she continued. “I 
always talk about how 
special it is that the four 
of us are really close and 
we really value our time 
together.” She tells me 
about how she and her 
bandmates were listening 
to Lorde’s Melodrama, Superorganism’s 
debut album and Taylor Swift. “We did an 
interview recently where Spencer was like, 
‘We were inspired by our own pre-show 
playlist.’”
For what it’s worth, the freshness of 
Young Enough seems like just the right 
thing. Guppy was recorded twice, with 
a handful of those songs being five years 
old. So, naturally, outgrowing the things 
that don’t make sense anymore makes 
room for exciting, new things. “When we 
were writing Young Enough, it served as a 
really perfect barometer for how much I 
had changed from the past couple of years,” 
Hendricks said.

MUSIC INTERVIEW

I 
have 
a 
Morgan 
Parker 
poem tacked above my bed. Last 
February I nailed a copy of “Let 
Me Handle My Business, Damn,” 
from Parker’s killer 2017 debut 
“There Are More Beautiful Things 
Than Beyoncé,” to my wall, where 
it has remained to this day, again 
finding me/you/us swimming in 
winter’s brine.
Morgan Parker is a poet of the 
powerful area between awareness 
and authority, a writer who will 
recompose the details around her, 
brilliantly, until she finds enough 
space to thrive. In “Let Me Handle 
My Business, Damn,” our speaker 
is “in the tub holding down / that 
on-sale Bordeaux pretending / 
to be well adjusted,” keeping it 
together while keeping it real, a 
gritty and generous situational 
awareness that casually grounds 
the declaration that comes next: 
“I am on that real / jazz shit 
sometimes I run the streets / 
sometimes they run me.” It finds 
raw glamour and rhythm without 
loftiness or idealism, and that’s 
exactly where its power lies.
Parker is able to generate 
command out of nearly any 
detail, granting phrases like “bad 
drugs bad wine mu shu pork” 
an emboldening, mantric sound 
before you even realize what the 
words are. This is tenacity: Morgan 
Parker can wring purpose and 
power from anything, rendering 
creativity and resilience one and 
the same. And she knows she’s got 
it — in a recent print interview, 
Poets & Writers asked Parker “You 
are a literary superhero — what 
is your name, your superpower, 
your kryptonite?” Her response: 
“Morgan Parker; Morgan Parker.”
In “Magical Negro,” her second 
collection of poems and third 
published work, Parker derives 
her superpower from the cultural 
legacy of Blackness and Black 
womanhood. 
The 
collection 

maintains the sensory creativity of 
“There Are More Beautiful Things 
Than Beyoncé,” but complicates it 
with historical and sociocultural 
texture. In an interview with 
Lumina, Parker explains that her 
previous collection “felt very full 
in terms of references and colors 
and places and people and songs,” 
whereas “(“Magical Negro”) felt 
full as in, like, a heavy book.”
Full and heavy it is. There are 
anthems in “Magical Negro,” 
but there are also histories, 
indictments and tributes. These 
poems are about pain, but they 
refuse to wallow — in fact, they 
use pain, picking it up and holding 
it in different contextual lights to 
illustrate what Publishers Weekly 
calls “a culture and community 
where irreplicable nuances are 
created in spite of, not because of, 
pain and trauma.”
“Magical Negro” crackles with 
the power of identity. In “When a 
Man I Love Jerks Off in My Bed 
Next to Me and Falls Asleep,” 
our speaker relays that “When 
I walk into the world and know 
/ I am a black girl, I understand 
/ I am a costume. I know the 
rules. / I like the pain because it 
makes me.” These poems locate a 
community’s tenacity of in spite of 
its trauma, an everyday superhero 
recomposition of pain into power 
through deadpan-statements like 
“There’s no way a black woman / 
killed herself, because everyone 
knows 
we 
can 
withstand 
/ 
inhuman amounts of pain” in “A 
Brief History of the Present,” a 
poem that ends with our speaker 
describing “tectonic plates clicking 
/ like a jaw, and — stubbornly, like 
history — my mouth / becoming 
their mouth speaking who I am.”
“Magical 
Negro” 
moves 
back and forth across time and 
form to galvanize this power. 
In one volume, Parker remixes 
the Confiteor into a satire of 
Brooklynite 
millennial 
culture 
(“Here is the bright young food 
co-op. / Here is the steeple.”), 

writes a tribute to Zora Neale 
Hurston (one of an excellent 
many to come out this month), 
and describes what it’s like to 
date White dudes named Matt 
(“Matt smokes unfiltered Pall 
Malls because Kurt / Vonnegut 
did.”). The February poem in 
this collection is “What I Am,” 
an anthem inspired by Terrance 
Hayes that finds the electricity in 
the everyday, in “waiting in line 
at Walgreens / for my pills and 
texting / a white man I hope will 
fuck me,” and in recognizing that 
“I play / my tarot only at night, my 
eyes fall, / I get mean, I fall in love, 
I deny this.”
The collection ends on a 
powerful reimagining of “It was 
summer now and the colored 
people came out into the sunshine, 
full blown with flowers,” an iconic 
line from Gertrude Stein’s “Three 
Lives.” But in “Magical Negro,” 
the procession is far from flowers 
and sunshine. It’s “descend(ing) 
from the boat two by two,” it’s 
“The gap in James Baldwin’s 
teeth speak(ing) to the gap in 
Malcolm X’s teeth,” it’s “Frederick 
Douglass’s side part kiss(ing) 
Nikki Giovanni’s Thug Life tattoo.” 
It’s a choir:
“The choir loses its way. The 
choir never returns home.
The choir sings funeral instead of 
wedding, singe funeral
instead of allegedly, sings funeral 
instead of help, sings
Black instead of grace, sings 
Black as knucklebone,
mercy, junebug, sea air. It is time 
for war.”

Some movies have the distinct ability to be 
forgotten as soon as the end credits start rolling. 
“Isn’t It Romantic?” is one of them. I remember 
laughing a couple of times and cringing many 
more, but, for the most part, I remember feeling 
nothing. I think that’s the best way to describe 
this film: nothing, a pit of nothingness. And no 
amount of uncomfortable musical sequences 
and flashy colors can remedy that. “Isn’t It 
Romantic?” desperately tries to be both a satire 
and a comedy, but because it fails to effectively 
be either, it hardly leaves an impact.
As a lifelong lover of romantic comedies, I 
was actually quite excited to see the film. Based 
on its marketing, it seemed that the movie was 
appealing to people just like me — people who 
adore the genre and would surely recognize 
its many references to iconic rom-coms of days 
gone by. While the movie is certainly aware of its 
predecessors and actively references them, the 
references are nowhere near as funny or original 
as the movie wants them to be. On a strictly 
nostalgic level, “Isn’t It Romantic?” disappoints.
The premise of “Isn’t It Romantic?” is 
anything but groundbreaking. Other romantic 
comedy satires like “Not Another Teen Movie” 
and “They Came Together,” while also pretty 
bad, do exactly what “Isn’t It Romantic?” tries 
to do, but often in much more entertaining and 
original ways. On top of that, the movie treats 
its audience as if it isn’t already aware of the 
countless tropes that plague the genre. The vast 
majority of rom-com enthusiasts are already 
well aware of the common cliches (the gay best 

friend, the mandatory makeover scene, for 
example). The movie refuses to acknowledge the 
fact that most rom-com lovers don’t watch rom-
coms for their intellectual and artistic merits; 
rather, rom-coms serve as a source of escapism 
from the mundanity of daily life. A character in 
the movie actually makes this exact point early 
on, but it’s immediately glossed over. “Isn’t It 
Romantic?” condescends its audience by making 
the obvious tropes it points out appear newly 
discovered.

Nevertheless, the movie isn’t completely 
ineffective, mainly due to its surprisingly 
wonderful lead performances. This is the most 
human, most authentic Rebel Wilson (“How 
To Be Single”) I’ve seen yet. She isn’t defined 
by her size, as she seems to be in virtually every 
other film of comparable popularity. “Isn’t It 
Romantic?” presents Wilson as a fully human 
being, a woman whose size is a part of her, but 
not all of her. She’s funny and relatable and 
real. Her primary love interest, Adam DeVine 
(“When We First Met”), also does a great job. 

DeVine, like Wilson, is another victim of type-
casting. And while “Isn’t It Romantic?” plays off 
of DeVine’s signature brand of comedy, it gives 
him much more to work with. Not only is he 
funny and a bit eccentric, he’s also introspective, 
thoughtful and romantic.
Although Wilson and DeVine are more 
widely known as on-screen lovers in the “Pitch 
Perfect” franchise, their relationship in “Isn’t 
It Romantic?” is significantly improved. While 
their characters in “Pitch Perfect” seem to be 
coupled together solely because they’re the 
oddballs of their respective acapella groups, 
their coupling in this movie actually makes 
sense. They have palpable chemistry and the 
personalities of the characters mesh naturally. 
Their time together on-screen is pretty enjoyable 
to watch; the problem is that there’s simply not 
enough of it. Instead, the movie chooses to focus 
on what it deems to be much more important: 
endless montages and utterly meaningless 
dance sequences.
“Isn’t It Romantic?” fails in nearly all respects. 
It’s not original enough to be a worthwhile satire, 
and it’s not romantic enough to be on par with 
the rom-coms it’s mocking. The performances 
of Wilson and DeVine are simply not enough 
to save it. I sincerely hope this movie isn’t the 
one to usher in a new era of romantic comedies. 
However, if it is, the genre will have become yet 
another victim to the modern age of nostalgia-
obsessed entertainment. In order to recover 
from this before it’s too late, it’s crucial that 
filmmakers strive to work against everything 
this movie stands for and create movies that 
respect the foundations of the genre while still 
adding onto the canon in exciting and innovative 
ways.

‘Isn’t It Romantic?’ isn’t, actually

FILM REVIEW

ELISE GODFRYD
For the Daily

When 
I 
babysat 
young 
children 
over 
the 
summer, 
I often gave them connect-
the-dots 
workbooks. 
These 
activities 
take 
more 
forethought and precision than 
you might expect. Neglect or 
misappropriate 
connections 
between the dots, and by the 
time you’re finished and inspect 
the big picture, you have no idea 
what you’re looking at. Now, the 
two- and five-year-old whom 
I babysat often impressed me 
with their efforts to connect 
the dots and sometimes their 
accuracy as well. Unfortunately, 
the 
endeavor 
becomes 
less 
impressive the older you get, so 
I cannot let the trio of adult men 
(Gustavo Steinberg, “End of the 
Line,” Gabriel Bitar, “Cidade 
Cinza” and Andre Catoto, “Say 
I am Only Seventeen”) who 
directed “Tito and the Birds” 
off the hook.
In the opening sequence 
of their animated children’s 
film “Tito and the Birds,” they 
outline an ambitious, disparate 
set of dots to connect. First and 
most conventionally, given the 
genre, they establish the titular 
young character Tito’s (Pedro 
Henrique) family dynamics: an 
inventor father named Rufus 
(Matheus Nachtergaele, “City 
of God”) who Tito idolizes, 
and an overprotective mother 
Rosa (Denise Fraga, “Norma”). 
Then, of course, come the birds. 
The first invention of Rufus’s 
we see is a machine intended 
to interpret the language of 
birds, for, as Rufus impresses 
upon his son, birds have been 
watching out for mankind from 
the beginning. This machine 
also sets the story in motion one 
night when it malfunctions and 
injures Tito, and an indignant 
Rosa sends Rufus packing. A 
third point raised in “Tito,” 
perhaps more compelling than 
any other, is that of the role the 
media plays in fearmongering, 
articulated 
through 
Alaor 
Souza (Matheus Solano, “Amor 

á Vida”), a sensationalist TV 
personality 
who 
dominates 
characters’ screens throughout 
the film that ensues.
Family, 
fearmongering, 
birds. Birds save family from 
fearmongering? Maybe. These 
dots are tentatively linked in 
the opening sequence, but the 
connections become stretched 
and overwrought in due time, 
as well as undermined when 
they drop the ball on other 
points that arise along the way 
(the most notable example of 

which are class distinctions in 
the film, which are only ever 
addressed haphazardly). Most 
disappointing of all, this anti-
fearmongering film scared me, 
on several counts.
The 
first 
count: 
they 
misrepresent fear. There is a 
fine line between exaggerating 
the 
visual 
dimension 
of 
concepts 
to 
appeal 
to 
children and oversimplifying 
complexities to make them 
more digestible for a particular 
audience. “Tito” consistently 
teeters on the brink of the latter. 
Intending 
to 
represent 
the 
debilitating, divisive effects of 
paranoia on society, the makers 
of “Tito and the Birds” render 
fear as an epidemic, highly 
contagious and with ghastly 
bodily consequences. In the 
process, they confound physical 

disability 
and 
psychological 
states in a troubling way. 
People with disabilities do not 
have a choice in the matter; 
consumers of media and the 
disciples of media pundits who 
abuse their platforms, on the 
other hand, do. This misleading 
message about disabilities may 
effectively scare children out of 
succumbing to fearmongering, 
but it’s at the expense of an oft-
misrepresented population.
On the topic of scaring 
kids away from fear, there 
lies the second count: the 
visuals themselves. At first 
enticing for their novelty (a 
likely descendent of “Loving 
Vincent,” 
comprised 
largely 
of oil paintings in motion), the 
imagery in “Tito and the Birds” 
becomes overly saturated with 
the fear the protagonists of the 
film try to resist. I doubt the 
intended audience of children 
will have the same resolve as 
Tito when confronted with 
disturbing graphics, such as the 
Jabba the Hutt-esque, reverse 
metamorphosis those afflicted 
with 
the 
fear 
“outbreak” 
undergo.
The third count is all about 
the birds, for “Tito and the 
Birds” 
is 
a 
well-disguised 
but problematic portrayal of 
man’s relationship with the 
environment. 
“Tito” 
teems 
with modern technology; it 
would seem Rufus’s admonition 
to once more listen to the 
birds would beseech respect 
for nature in spite of the 
industrialized, digitized world. 
Unfortunately, in “Tito,” the 
birds get nothing in return for 
their wisdom. We might never 
get past exploitative model of 
our relationship with nature if 
we do not even have the gall to 
imagine a mutual relationship 
in a children’s film.
If I were still babysitting, 
we’d skip “Tito.” We would 
keep working on connecting 
the dots, and maybe we’d form 
an image of a bird. But maybe 
then we’d add a few dots and 
draw ourselves. Imagine what it 
would look like to have genuine 
respect for the natural world.

FILM REVIEW

‘Tito and 
the Birds’

Shout! Studios

State Theatre

The early ’70s are often 
romanticized — good vibes, 
groovy music and sociopolitical 
activism. It can simultaneously 
be said that the early ’70s were 
a time of heightened anxiety. 
These years came in the wake 
of 
JFK’s 
assassination, 
the 
Vietnam 
War, 
the 
Manson 
murders, 
the 
Civil 
Rights 
Movement 
and 
the 
beginnings 
of 
the 
Beatles’s 
something 
like desolate “hippy” 
era.
The 
UMMA’s 
exhibition 
“Abstraction, 
Color, 
and Politics in the 
Early 1970s” captures 
the unnerving vibe of 
the era through four 
large-scale 
works 
by American artists 
contemporary 
to 
the 
time: 
Helen Frankenthaler, Louise 
Nevelson, Sam Gilliam and Al 
Loving. The former are Jewish 
women, the latter Black men.
The emphasis of the gallery 
tour was heavily placed on public 
evaluation of art in the ’70s. 
Whether art was considered 
“good art” to critics and viewers 
depended on its ability to help 
advance social movements. The 
emphasis of social value was 
placed on feminism and civil 
rights in the case of these artists, 
given the politics of the era and 
the artists’ identities. Activism 
was difficult to navigate in 
the context of abstract art on 
the premise of its abstraction 
— their work didn’t mean the 

same thing to any one person. In 
turn, these artists received mass 
criticism because their art was 
“not political enough.”
Al 
Loving’s 
response 
to 
this criticism was perhaps the 
most jarring part of the talk. 
Loving was the first African 
American artist to have his own, 
one-person exhibition at the 
Whitney Museum of American 
Art in New York City less than 

a year after he moved there. He 
was immediately hailed in the 
white, upper-class art scene and 
became popular among buyers 
and patrons. He’d risen to fame. 
At a certain point, however, 
Loving began to lose touch 
with his work. The demand was 
so high that he began hiring 
assistants to paint for him, and 
he consequently slipped away 
from self-expression in his art.
Loving was simultaneously 
criticized 
by 
Black 
critics 
and activists of the time, who 
claimed that his art was far 
removed from Black activism 
and the Civil Rights Movement. 
They further criticized Loving 
for not using his momentous 
career to support and further 

the 
Movement, 
given 
his 
identity as a Black American 
artist. Loving was devastated by 
this criticism, so much so that 
he destroyed most of his work.
The 
women 
artists, 
Frankenthaler and Nevelson, 
had to consider vastly different 
political 
expectations 
in 
their art. Women artists were 
expected to both avoid and 
embody femininity in their 
work. 
They 
were 
expected 
to 
find 
a 
space 
between 
feminist and feminine 
— they were not to be 
too much of one or 
the 
other. 
Delicacy 
in 
female 
art 
was 
criticized, but so was 
violence. 
This 
was 
considered dangerous 
in 
abstraction, 
given its room for 
interpretation. 
As 
a 
result, 
both 
Frankenthaler 
and 
Nevelson 
resisted 
politics 
altogether 
in 
their 
work. However, Frankenthaler’s 
Sunset Corner is reminiscent of 
a menstrual painting, but the 
viewer can make of that what 
they will.
The gallery talk ultimately 
distilled 
common 
narratives 
around the ’70s and around 
the general politicization of 
art, making a statement about 
what it means to navigate 
being an artist of an oppressed 
demographic 
in 
a 
time 
of 
political strife and upheaval. 
The 
talk 
gave 
necessary 
background on these artists that 
otherwise couldn’t be inferred 
from the exhibit alone, making 
their work more profound, even 
today.

For Black History Month, a legacy

For players slipping and sliding 
on the icy sidewalk outside Ray 
Fisher Stadium while leaving 
practice on Wednesday, the words 
“Branch Rickey Classroom” on the 
stadium wall might have been easy 
to miss. But inside the classroom 
— whose walls are adorned with 
murals 
documenting 
Rickey’s 
contributions to baseball — the 
team has learned extensively about 
his legacy. 
Rickey is best known for 
integrating 
Major 
League 
Baseball with the signing of Jackie 
Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers 
in 1947 and the invention of the 
farm team system. His four years 
spent coaching Michigan’s baseball 
team from 1910 to 1913 are often 
forgotten.
“I don’t know if there’s a better 
pioneer for our game,” said current 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. “So 
to have him on our wall and as 
the namesake for our classroom, 
to know that he coached here 
from 1910 to 1913 and went on to 
make such an impact in the game, 
is just a major source of pride and 
inspiration for our players and for 
me.”
Rickey’s frustration with racial 
prejudice was evident from early 
in his career. While coaching at 
his alma mater, Ohio Wesleyan 
University, Rickey was disgusted 
to find out that the South Bend, 
Ind. hotel the team was staying in 
that night was refusing African-
American player Charles Thomas 
a room. Rickey quickly arranged 
a cot for Thomas to sleep on in his 
own room.
In his time with the Wolverines 
— during part of which he balanced 
his coaching duties with a full law 
school courseload — he continued 
to 
harbor 
a 
commitment 
to 
equality that would be on display 
throughout his long career.
With February being Black 
History 
Month, 
Michigan 
baseball’s legacy in equality is 
especially prominent in the team’s 
mind. And Rickey is only part of the 

story.
Long before Rickey signed 
Jackie Robinson and helped break 
Major League Baseball’s modern-
era 
color 
barrier, 
Michigan 
alumnus Moses Fleetwood Walker 
became one of the first African-
American professional baseball 
players in 1884 upon signing 
with the American Association’s 
Toledo Blue Stockings. Walker 
attended Michigan Law School 
from 1881 to 1882 and played in the 
Wolverines’ 1882 season, leading 
the once-beleaguered squad to a 
10-3 record with his strong hitting 
and catching. His brother, Weldy 
Wilberforce Walker, who played 
at Michigan in the 1883 and 1884 
seasons, eventually joined him in 
Toledo.
“The team was very interested to 
learn about the Walker brothers,” 
Bakich said. “That they were 
among the first African-Americans 
to play baseball makes them stand 
out in Michigan’s history.”
After Moses Walker left the 
Blue Stockings in 1889, the league’s 
directors agreed to no longer offer 
contracts to Black players. No 
players of color would again play in 
the major leagues until Robinson’s 
signing in 1947.
106 years after Branch Rickey 
left Ann Arbor, Bakich tries his best 
to live up to his legacy.
“You know, the first year I 
was here, there were no minority 
players on our team,” Bakich said. 
“Maybe this is just a personal 
philosophy or preference, but I just 
feel that at this school, especially 
given its legacy, our roster should 

look like the United States of 
America.”
That approach has been reflected 
in the dedicated effort made by 
Bakich since his arrival in 2013 to 
recruit from diverse backgrounds. 
Michigan’s team today is far more 
diverse than it was seven years ago 
with six African-American players
“There are so many outstanding 
players of color often hidden in 
poor communities who just aren’t 
able to play on those expensive 
travel teams or make their rounds 
on the summer circuit,” Bakich 
said. “So when you can find those 
guys and target those guys and 
have kids from all backgrounds 
and socioeconomic statuses. … I 
think it’s a win not only for them 
and their families but also for our 
program and for everyone on our 
team, which is why we recruit the 
way we do.” 
Rickey graduated from the 
University’s 
law 
school 
with 
highest honors and would often 
use his legal knowledge — a rarity 
among MLB managers — to his 
and his teams’ advantage. Upon 
leaving Ann Arbor in 1913, he 
recommended 
the 
stadium’s 
current namesake, Ray Fisher, to 
replace him. At the time, The Daily 
bid him a fond farewell:
“(Rickey) leaves with a sterling 
record behind him, and a host of 
friends to remember him. ... Above 
all he taught clean ball, gentlemanly 
tactics, and clean living. 
“... 
A 
gentleman, 
a 
true 
sportsman, and a man, he will long 
be remembered by those who love 
and help Michigan athletics.”

Grant Gabriele returns to Ann Arbor

In his USA Hockey National 
Team Development Program 
days, 
Grant 
Gabriele 
was 
emphatically circling the date 
of his most-anticipated game 
— the team’s exhibition match 
against Michigan.
Now a Division 1 athlete, 
little has changed, except a 
higher level and a bigger stage.
The Ohio State defenseman 
grew up in Brighton, Mich. 
with a dream. At age 17, he was 
set to be a full-time player for 
the USNTDP after a brief stint 
on the Under-17 team as a part-
time reserve. He had hoped 
to be more involved with the 
Under-18 team, and when he 
received the call-up, it was a 
moment of fulfillment.
Settling in Ann Arbor, the 
city where the team played in 
before moving to Plymouth in 
2015, he stepped on grounds 
that he had been involved with 
his entire life.
When Gabriele was nine, 
he welcomed a new kid on the 
block. It was Jon Merrill, who 
went on to play three years for 
the Wolverines and currently 
plays for the Las Vegas Golden 
Knights. But at the time, for 
Gabriele, he was just his friend. 
Despite the five-year age gap, 
the two would hang out, even 
before 
Gabriele 
found 
out 
Merrill was a hockey player
Around the time he moved 
to Brighton, Merrill became 
the youngest player to commit 
to an NCAA hockey team. It 
was none other than the school 
the two had grown around: 
Michigan. Two years later, 
Merrill took the next step in 
his progression as a player and 
moved to Ann Arbor to be part 
of the USNTDP, paving a path 
for Gabriele to follow.
When Gabriele got his call 
up, it was Merrill that he went 
to for advice, asking about 
the experience and how to 
approach being a full-time 

player.
“It’s funny how our routes 
kinda ended being the same 
with USA and Big Ten college,” 
Gabriele said.
Merrill 
had 
raved 
about 
the amount of fun he had over 
those two years, but Gabriele 
spent only one year there 
before 
moving 
forward 
to 
different United States Hockey 
League 
teams, 
with 
brief 
stints at Omaha, Chicago and 
Muskegon. His year with the 
U18, however, wasn’t wasted. 
He ended the season with four 
goals and twelve assists for 
sixteen total points. But in the 
midst of the season was a much-
anticipated matchup.
An exhibition game doesn’t 
mean much. It doesn’t count in 
terms of standings. Both teams 
hold out players. But for many, 
like Gabriele, playing Michigan 
was always circled on their 
calendars.
“It’s 
always 
seems 
like 
some USA guys end up going 
to Michigan because of the 
location,” Gabriele said. “So it’s 
always a big matchup because 
of the kids going there, and the 
kids on the team.”
Michigan had five USNTDP 
alums on roster at the time, 
some of whom had been in the 
program as recent as the year 
before. The game itself wasn’t 
a pretty picture for USNTDP. 
Losing 7-4, the team snapped 
a two-year win streak against 
the Wolverines in its worst 
loss against Michigan in over a 
decade.

Eventually, 
Gabriele 
left 
the program. But despite the 
experiences in juniors leading 
him 
toward 
Michigan, 
he 
gravitated toward Ohio State 
— a sentiment he often shared 
with Merrill.
“I was still in juniors so I 
always told him I was a fan of 
Ohio State,” Gabriele said. “And 
he would always kind of gave 
me a little crap about it because 
he was going to Michigan.”
During his stay with the 
Waterloo Blackhawks, he made 
up his mind. Having previously 
committed 
to 
Western 
Michigan, Gabriele decided the 
Buckeyes were the best course 
of action for his dream to be in 
the National Hockey League.
A “no-brainer” decision for 
him, Gabriele committed to 
Ohio State, believing it was 
the best chance to make his 
dreams a reality. He didn’t see 
any action his freshman year 
but worked himself into the 
rotation his current sophomore 
year. Just like before, to him, 
the Michigan matchup — this 
weekend — meant a little more.
“The Michigan-Ohio State 
rivalry in hockey has been 
pretty intense,” Gabriele said. 
“So when we see that on the 
schedule, it always gets people 
going. It’s just kind of a big 
game people look for and a fun 
one. Just a lot of intensity and 
the tension between the two 
teams are pretty crazy.”
And again, just like before, 
he made sure a certain date on 
his calendar was circled.

Seven straight!

Wolverines top Scarlet Knights, 86-76, for their seventh-straight win, further boosting NCAA Tournament chances

When 
Akienreh 
Johnson 
lobbed a pass from the corner 
into a double-teamed Hallie 
Thome midway through the 
fourth quarter, it looked like 
a turnover waiting to happen. 
Instead, 
Thome 
plucked 
it 
out mid-air and finished the 
contested layup.
A pass that would’ve resulted 
in a failed possession earlier in 
the season instead resulted in 
two points.
The bad luck and late-game 
struggles that had plagued the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team (19-9 overall, 10-6 Big 
Ten) at the beginning of Big 
Ten play, were nowhere to be 
seen during their 88-76 victory 
over Rutgers (18-8 overall, 
10-5) on Thursday night.
Johnson catalyzed Michigan 
early. Within the span of a 
minute, the junior guard had 
converted an offensive putback 
on one end, dove to the floor 
to win a jump-ball and then 
blocked 
a 
Scarlet 
Knight’s 
jumper.
On top of their early lead, 
midway 
through 
the 
first 
quarter, the Wolverines also 
welcomed 
freshman 
point 
guard Amy Dilk back from 
a 
knee-injury 
which 
had 
sidelined her for the past three 
games. Michigan looked much 
more 
organized 
offensively 
with Dilk back at the helm.
“It’s awesome to have her 
back,” said freshman forward 
Naz Hillmon. “It mostly just 
the point of her getting her 
confidence back and getting 
back into the flow of things. 
Even 
though 
we’ve 
been 
winning, we definitely wanted 
her back on the court because 
she’s such a great floor general.”
Despite 
the 
Wolverines’ 
energetic 
start, 
Rutgers 
hung tough. On a number 
of 
occasions, 
the 
Scarlet 
Knights were able to break the 
Michigan’s full-court press and 
find an open shooter. For every 

layup a Wolverine converted, a 
Scarlet Knight would respond 
with one of their own.
After a back-and-forth ten 
minutes, Michigan held a one-
point advantage.
The 
opening 
minutes 
of 
the 
second 
quarter 
were 
characterized 
by 
frequent 
game stoppages. A loose-ball 
foul here, a shooting foul there. 
Even with the discontinuity, the 
Wolverines were able to open 
up an eight-point lead. In the 
midst of a sloppy possession, 
the ball found its way into the 
hands of senior guard Nicole 
Munger, who nailed her second 
three-pointer 
of 
the 
game 
from the top of the key. Soon 
after, Deja Church punctuated 
a Michigan fast-break with a 
skillful euro-step layup.
“I think we’ve gotten good 
on finding the open people 
and 
finding 
the 
offensive 
lanes,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “Deja and 
Akienreh have done a great job 
of finding the lanes and being 
able to penetrate through that. 
Akienreh did a great job of that 
tonight. But we want to take 
advantage of matchups at all 
times.”
Similar to the first quarter 
though, 
Rutgers 
wouldn’t 
go away. Charise Wilson cut 
the deficit to just two points 
heading into the break after 
capitalizing on a slow defensive 
rotation from the Wolverines 
and hitting a three from the 
wing.
The seesawing nature of the 
game continued into the second 
half. Following a threaded 
bounce pass from Church to 
Hillmon for an easy layup, the 
Scarlet Knights’ Stasha Carey 
converted a reverse layup off 
a precise no-look dish from 
her driving teammate. The 
Wolverines 
answered 
right 
back though. Again off an assist 
from Church, Hillmon finished 
a floater through traffic for an 
and-one opportunity.
Michigan re-established its’ 
eight-point 
advantage 
when 

Dilk stripped the ball from her 
opposite number and threw it 
ahead to junior forward Kayla 
Robbins, who finished at the 
rim.
Rutgers did everything it 
could to come back in the fourth 
quarter, but the Wolverines 
held firm. Hillmon — who 
finished with a team-high 21 
points — was a big reason why. 
She was an immovable object 
on the block down the stretch, 
with every touch under the 
basket leading to two points.
“I keep telling her teammates 
‘Just get Naz the ball!’ ” Barnes 
Arico said. “She’s just special. 
She has a knack for scoring the 
basketball with such a quick 
move and an explosive release. 
She can get her shot off against 
anyone. We did a great job of 
finding her in the second half.”
Michigan’s seventh straight 
victory was cemented a few 
minutes later when Johnson 
converted a floater from the 
baseline and Thome scored 
another layup through contact.
“We 
just 
have 
to 
keep 
sticking to one game at a time,” 
Munger said. “We’re having 
fun right and on the court we’re 
always smiling.” 

With under three minutes 
remaining, senior guard Nicole 
Munger 
received 
the 
ball 
following an inbounds play. The 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team (10-6 Big Ten, 19-9 overall) 
led Rutgers (10-5, 18-8) by six 
points, but the Scarlet Knights 
immediately brought the full-
court press on Munger.
It didn’t matter.
Munger created enough space 
for herself to send a pass to junior 
guard Akienreh Johnson near 
the right sideline at half-court. 
Johnson then connected with 
sophomore guard Deja Church 
who capitalized with a layup.
By no means was that play a 
major momentum-shifter, but it 
exemplified why the Wolverines 
won their seventh in a row 
on Thursday night: they are 
balanced and willing to share the 
ball.
“It’s not one person on this 
team that you can key on and 
stop,” Munger said. “And that’s 
what makes it a really dangerous 
team.”
At no point during that play did 
Michigan hesitate; the players 

stayed calm and trusted each 
other enough to make critical 
passes.
“I 
think 
that 
everyone’s 
stepping 
up,” 
Munger 
said. 
“Everybody is just making plays 
and we’re playing around each 
other. No one’s trying to force 
anything, and I think that’s the 
strength of our team because 
we’ll make extra passes and shots 
are falling.”
A quick glance at Thursday’s 
stats shows the balance of this 
squad. Freshman forward Naz 
Hillmon led her team in scoring 
with 21 points, but Munger, 
senior 
center 
Hallie 
Thome 
and Church hit double figures 
too. And junior forward Kayla 
Robbins and sophomore forward 
Hailey Brown also played key 
roles.
Having a balanced team is 
not always rosy. Without a main 
scorer, teams often don’t know 
who to fall back on in crunch 
time.
The Wolverines though, are 
managing just fine.
“Anybody on any given night 
can give you 20, and I think 
that’s what’s so special about our 
team,” Hillmon said. “ … When 
you have five players on the floor 

who can score, who can pass, 
who can do those little things it’s 
really hard to stop, really hard to 
guard. And we know that from 
playing against teams who have 
five players on the floor who can 
score in any way.”
Against 
Rutgers, 
multiple 
players 
proved 
crucial 
at 
different moments. For instance 
with the game still close and the 
shot clock winding down in the 
third, Brown calmly drained a 
triple from the right wing to give 
her team a spark.
Later in the third period, the 
Scarlet Knights hit a 3-pointer to 
cut Michigan’s lead to four. But 
then Munger responded with a 
triple from the left corner to keep 
her team ahead.
About 
a 
minute 
later, 
freshman guard Amy Dilk — in 
her first game back from a knee 
injury — reached out near the top 
of the key to intercept a pass and 
generate fast-break points for her 
team.
And the Wolverines’ post play 
was solid, too, led by Hillmon and 
Thome.
“If you get the ball inside to 

Hallie Thome or Naz Hillmon, 
that’s probably a 70-percent 
chance that that ball is going in,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico.
During the last few weeks, 
Michigan watched film of a game 
from last season against Illinois. 
That team, centered around 
Katelynn Flaherty, was much 
different. Munger takes note of 
this.
“We’re so much more versatile 
this year,” Munger said. “ … 
We make the extra passes and 
everyone’s a threat to knock 
down shots. That’s just really, 
really, really tough to guard as 
a defense, cause usually you 
have one or two really good 
defenders.”
The 
Wolverines’ 
balanced-
attack is helping them hit their 
stride during this important 
stretch of the season. If it 
continues, it could help them 
realize 
their 
post-season 
aspirations.

MINNEAPOLIS — Williams 
Arena is as much airplane 
hangar as basketball arena. The 
home of the Minnesota men’s 
basketball team is capable of 
producing noise belying its 
cavernous 
interior, 
and 
its 
raised court and double-decker 
stands harken back to the 
vintage days of the sport.
Opened in 1928, Williams 
is college basketball’s sixth-
oldest arena and one of its 
most unique. When stacked 
up to modern venues and their 
amenities, it doesn’t seem all 
that sexy, but it’s steeped in 
history and proudly displays 
all of its 91 years. It is what it’s 
always been.
On Thursday night, Michigan 
went to Minneapolis and beat 
the 
host 
Golden 
Gophers, 
69-60, moving to 13-3 in Big 
Ten play and 24-3 overall. The 
Wolverines, 
too, 
were 
who 
they’ve always been.
Specifically, 
that 
means 
an offense that occasionally 
struggles to score, but a defense 
that usually turns one half of 
the court into a 2,350-square-
foot torture chamber. It’s not 
always aesthetically appealing 
basketball, 
but 
it’s 
gotten 
Michigan to No. 7 in the nation. 
The Wolverines are perfectly 
content with that.
“I think that they understand 
that 
(defense) 
is 
the 
one 
consistent thing we can have 
every day,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein.
That 
doesn’t 
mean 
the 
Wolverines 
won’t 
lunge 
at 
the chance for an offensive 
explosion, 
however 
— 
and 
at early on, against the Big 
Ten’s 
second-least 
efficient 
defense, it looked like the fuse 
was lit. Michigan nailed three 
3-pointers in the game’s first 
eight minutes, shooting to a 17-6 
lead during which every starter 
got on the scoreboard.

It got ugly fast.
Minnesota big men Jordan 
Murphy 
and 
Daniel 
Oturu 
were two of the main reasons. 
Murphy, a 6-foot-8 bowling 
ball, gobbled up five offensive 
rebounds and 10 total in the 
first half. Oturu had 10 of his 
own, as well as 10 points for 
a double-double by halftime. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
Golden 
Gophers (7-9, 17-10) held the 
Wolverines to just 11 points 
from 11:57 until intermission. 
Eight of Minnesota’s 18 first-
half points came from second-
chance opportunities, as it went 
to the locker room down just 
10 despite shooting a putrid 22 
percent from the floor.
“Eventually our shots were 
gonna fall, so we gotta keep 
shooting,” said junior center 
Jon Teske. “We have all the 
trust in the world with all our 
teammates 
to 
knock 
down 
shots, and coaches give us trust 
to go shoot the ball.”
Michigan 
opened 
the 
floodgates 
after 
the 
break. 
Freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis scored seven points 
in fewer than two minutes, and 
Teske swished a three to quickly 
push the lead to 18, necessitating 
a timeout by Golden Gopher 
coach Richard Pitino.
The Wolverines were unable 
to pull away, however. After 
a 
3-pointer 
by 
sophomore 
forward Isaiah Livers made the 
score 50-29, they hit just three 
shots over seven minutes. An 
Oturu dunk off of a steal put 
Minnesota within 11 points 
with 4:47 to play, bringing the 
venerable arena to its feet.
But Teske answered Oturu 
with two straight 3-pointers, 
firing an imaginary bow-and-
arrow as he backpedaled down 
the court. The arrows proved to 
be fatal.
“We feel like everything’s 
going right and we’re playing 
really 
good 
defense,” 
said 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole. 
“We don’t really worry about 

the shots because we know how 
good we are of a shooting team.”
The second half was much 
closer to the breakout Michigan 
craved, as it hit eight 3-pointers 
on 57 percent shooting with 
Poole (21 points) and Teske (17) 
led the way.
“We made shots. It’s that 
simple,” Beilein said. “This is 
something that I would love 
to figure it out — why Jordan 
Poole can have the same shots 
and they don’t go in, Teske, 
they don’t go in … We just gotta 
continue to try to get good shots, 
and obviously, the better the 
shot, the more chance it’s gonna 
go in. I think that was pretty 
good today, our shot selection.”
Still, there was plenty of 
ugliness. Poole missed three 
free throws in the final minute, 
failing to completely slam the 
door shut. Instead, after the 
Golden Gophers turned the ball 
over, the Wolverines dribbled 
out the clock.
It wasn’t head-turning by any 
stretch, but Michigan did what 
it’s always done, and ended 
up getting the job done for its 
biggest conference road win.

MINNEAPOLIS 
— 
Last 
Tuesday, Michigan’s season met 
a flummoxing low point in its loss 
to last-place Penn State — a result 
that left many in a futile search for 
answers.
Charles 
Matthews, 
though, 
had no problems pinning an 
explanation to the loss.
“Sense of urgency, lack of focus 
right there,” the redshirt junior 
said at the time. “Simple as that.”
So after the loss, Matthews 
and junior guard Zavier Simpson, 
the team’s unquestioned leaders, 
imparted their wisdom on the rest 
of the Wolverines’ young roster.
“We just gotta be extremely 
locked in and come out to play 
every night,” said sophomore 
Jordan 
Poole, 
relaying 
their 
message. “Take the exact same 
approach. It can be hard if you go 
and play a team that doesn’t have 
that many wins in the league or 
you beat a team already earlier in 
the year.”
Thursday night, faced with 
an opponent who both all those 
boxes, the Wolverines did exactly 

that, beating Minnesota, 69-60.
In the entirety of Michigan’s 
31-game schedule, there may have 
been no easier game to overlook 
than its trip to Minneapolis. For 
months, the season has built to 
a crescendo of the Wolverines’ 
weekend 
showdown 
with 
Michigan State. The two schools 
have resided at the top of the 
conference standings all season, 
ranking 
in 
the 
nationwide 
top-10 together, bound on a 
collision course that will meet 
its destination over the next two 
weeks — in Ann Arbor on Sunday 
and then 13 days later in East 
Lansing.
So when Michigan’s offense 
came out flat against the Golden 
Gophers, hitting just 11-of-31 
shots before halftime, it would 
have been easy to concede that 
this wasn’t its day and move on 
to bigger things. Simpson and 
Matthews, though, wouldn’t let 
that happen.
“They stay on us,” Poole said. 
“They know that the game can 
change at any point in time and 
runs happen so we gotta stay 
locked in 24/7. Being able to have 
figures like that who’ve been in 

situations like this before is huge.”
Led by its two leaders — who 
finished with five of its six steals 
— the Wolverines’ defense paved 
the way for a dominating win 
that could have been anything 
but, considering the offensive 
struggles.
If Michigan’s first-half offense 
was ugly, Minnesota’s teetered on 
unwatchable. When the officials 
came back onto the court minutes 
after the halftime buzzer to rule 
that Daniel Oturu’s putback had 
beat the clock, it sent the Williams 
Arena crowd into a frenzy — out of 
reprieve as much as joy. After all, 
the points merely decided which 
pitiful point total the Golden 
Gophers would enter the break 
with, 16 or 18.
“With the guys that we have 
defensively right now, I think that 
they understand that this is the 
one consistent thing we can have 
every day,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein.
At the heart of it?
“If 
you 
listened 
to 
our 
walkthroughs, you would hear 
Zavier and Charles talking to 
people about what’s next and what 
we can do and giving alternatives 
to things,” Beilein said. “They’re 
coaching that defense just as 
much as our coaching staff is.”
And when the Wolverines’ 
offense got back on track in the 
second half — hitting eight of its 
14 threes — they raced out to a 
20-point lead that consigned the 
early struggles to history.
That same offensive spurt, 
though, also came against Penn 
State, when Michigan scored 20 
points in the first eight minutes of 
the half to cut its deficit to five. The 
problem then was that a 16-point 
deficit proved insurmountable. 
On the back of a renewed focus, 
that wasn’t an issue this time 
around.
Or — for a simpler answer — just 
ask assistant coach Luke Yaklich, 
who strode into Poole’s postgame 
scrum, coughed and offered up 
one word before moving on:
“Defense.”

Minnesota down, Michigan State to go
Wolverines’ identity manifests as they top Golden Gophers, 69-60, in last game before facing the Spartans

JACOB SHAMES

Is it personal for Cassius Winston?

EAST LANSING — As the 
scrum of reporters slowly started 
to dissipate, Cassius Winston sat 
in front of his locker in a white 
tank-top, 
eyes 
forward 
and 
engaged. Winston knew all too 
well that focus around this state 
will soon shift to himself and his 
counterpart in Ann Arbor, Zavier 
Simpson.
“We’re the leaders of our 
teams,” Winston said. “Both 
make our teams go.”
Inarguably, this is true. With 
shooting guard Josh Langford, 
and now center Nick Ward, gone, 
Winston’s importance has only 
been amplified for the Spartans. 
Early in Tuesday’s game against 
Rutgers, Winston drove the lane, 
tossing up a floater that Rutgers 
forward Myles Johnson blocked. 
Winston forced a smile, turned 
to run back on defense and 
smacked his hands together, the 
clap echoing through the Breslin 
Center.
As Winston struggled through 
the first half, shooting 3-for-9 
from the field, Michigan State 
struggled, taking 
a 
seven-point 
deficit into the 
locker room.
After 
re-emerging 
from the tunnel, 
the opposite held 
true. 
Winston 
owned the game 
and 
owned 
a 
building 
whose 
mind 
was 
already on the weekend. With 
the Spartans holding a one-point 
lead and the game teetering, 
Winston again drove the lane 
and again found a floater. This 
one went, and wearing a much-
wider smile, Winston again ran 
back down the floor, dapping 
up Michigan State guard Kyle 
Ahrens as he passed by.
In the second half, he scored 
19 
points, 
spearheading 
a 
comeback in what turned into a 
routine 71-60 win. He assisted 
six baskets. He played all 20 
minutes, and when he asked to 
come out, Tom Izzo refused.
That, Izzo explained, is simply 

what Michigan State needs from 
Cassius Winston right now.
“Man,” Izzo said, “I’m asking 
him to do everything except this 
press conference right now. And 
somehow, I’m gonna convince 
him that that’s a privilege, not a 
problem.”
Across the state, Simpson 
spent the last year molding 
Michigan 
to 
his 
persona, 
instilling a defense-first culture 
that took the Wolverines to the 
Final Four last year and has 
gotten them to a 23-3 record and 
the No. 7 ranking thus far this 
season.
“His 
leadership right 
now is as good 
as 
anybody 
we’ve ever had,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beilein 
after 
last 
Saturday’s 
65-52 win over 
Maryland. 
During 
the 
timeouts, Beilein let the players 
talk among themselves to figure 
things out. Simpson grabbed the 
whiteboard. “He’s got that ‘it’ 
that you need to lead a team,” 
Beilein said, “and the team 
respects him.”
The story of Zavier Simpson 
and Cassius Winston has, in 
the past, focused around Zavier 
Simpson. On Sunday, when the 
Spartans and Wolverines meet, 
tied atop the Big Ten standings, 
it will be about Cassius Winston.
The backstory between the 
two has been well played out. 
Izzo and John Beilein both 
recruited 
Winston 
as 
their 

top priority at point guard in 
the class of 2016. Beilein told 
Simpson he was interested, but 
only as a backup plan, should 
Winston fall through. Winston 
chose Michigan State. Simpson 
ended up at Michigan and knows 
how to hold a grudge.
In the regular season last year, 
the Wolverines came up to East 
Lansing unranked and upset 
a top-five team, with Simpson 
holding Winston to 11 points and 
4 turnovers. Then, on Mar. 2, 
after the Spartans beat Wisconsin 
in the Big Ten Tournament and 
with Michigan yet to play its 
game against Nebraska, Winston 
told reporters he wanted a 
rematch. He got one, but to little 
difference, scored 11 points, and 
again, he struggled in a loss.
These are the two levels on 
which Winston must operate 
Sunday. He must outplay Simpson 
because otherwise, the Spartans 
have little chance of winning. He 
must outplay Simpson because 
otherwise, he will be 0-3 against 
a player whom both schools 
recruited as a contingency — and 
in a lot of ways, that record will 
come precisely because of that 
fact.
This matchup is personal, at 
least on one side. On the other?
“Yeah, definitely,” Winston 
said. “Like I said, Michigan game. 
It’s always gonna be personal.”
Personal 
with 
Simpson, 
specifically?
“Uhh — I wouldn’t think about 
specifically. It would just — it 
comes with the game. You know 
what I’m saying?”
Thing 
is, 
Zavier 
Simpson 
might not.

Colin Castleton proves he belongs

MINNEAPOLIS — Jordan 
Poole didn’t want to talk to the 
media.
Here was the sophomore 
guard, after having scored 
a game-high 22 points and 
five 3-pointers, refusing the 
honor usually reserved for a 
performance of that caliber. 
There was someone who he felt 
deserved it more.
“All y’all gotta ask him 
a 
question,” 
Poole 
said, 
gesturing at Colin Castleton. 
“I’m not answering nobody’s 
questions ‘til you ask him.”
Castleton 
isn’t 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis, a contender for 
Big Ten Freshman of the Year. 
He isn’t Brandon Johns or 
David DeJulius, both of whom 
have shown the physicality to 
hold their own at this level. 
The forward from Daytona 
Beach, Fla. is a string-bean-
like 6-foot-11 and 210 pounds, a 
frame that has chained him to 
the scout team all season. He 
won’t turn 19 until May.
Feb. 1 at Iowa was Castleton’s 
first meaningful appearance 
of the season. He got in for 
three minutes at the end of 
the first half, an appearance 
precipitated by extreme foul 
trouble. It was Michigan coach 
John Beilein breaking the glass 
in case of an emergency.
Castleton’s 
first 
action 
since then, which came seven 
minutes into the Wolverines’ 
69-60 win over Minnesota, was 
still prompted by extenuating 
circimstances. Johns, whose 
gotten spot duty backing up 
junior Jon Teske at center, 
caught the flu earlier this week 
and was unable to practice 
at all, per Beilein. Castleton 
“auditioned” 
for 
Johns’ 
vacated minutes with redshirt 
sophomore Austin Davis and 
won.
“I’ve been ready all year,” 
he said. “I just work hard 
every day in practice because 
you never know when your 
opportunity will come.”
This opportunity wasn’t a 
beyond-any-doubt 
statement 
that Castleton is ready for the 

big time. In his four minutes, 
he 
missed 
his 
lone 
shot, 
grabbed 
one 
rebound 
and 
committed a personal foul. But 
for a freshman trying to make 
his way in college basketball, 
events such as that are imbued 
with importance, magnified in 
their memorability.
“Just, it’s go time, basically,” 
Castleton said. “Give the effort 
and get ready to play. That’s 
really it. Just do everything I 
got taught to do.”
Castleton’s 
length 
and 
wingspan had a tangible effect 
on the Golden 
Gophers’ 
muscular 
inside 
attack. 
With 4:16 left 
in 
the 
first 
half, he moved 
his 
feet 
and 
stayed vertical 
while guarding 
Eric 
Curry, 
who 
holds 
a 
two-year 
and 
30-pound advantage on him. 
With nowhere to go, Curry 
shuffled his feet, and the 
referee blew his whistle.
There’s nothing sexy about 
a travel. Most of the time, 
the 
defender 
doesn’t 
even 
get credit for it. But this was 
different.
This wasn’t playing on the 
scout team in an empty gym — 
this was a forced turnover on 
the road in the Big Ten. The 
enthusiastic reaction Castleton 
received from his teammates 
was as much a recognition of 
the moment’s significance as 

the play’s actual impact.
“It gives you confidence 
when teammates give me high 
fives and stuff,” Castleton 
said. “It’s a little play, but in 
my eyes it’s a really big play 
because I barely get minutes. 
So when it happens, it gives 
me confidence and shows that 
they care.”
As 
Castleton 
spoke 
to 
reporters, 
moments 
after 
Beilein said that he “won’t 
hesitate” 
to 
put 
him 
in 
similar 
situations 
in 
the 
future, assistant coach Saddi 
Washington 
snuck 
behind 
him and jovially 
grabbed 
his 
shoulders. 
Teske 
then 
walked 
past 
and delivered a 
congratulatory 
slap 
to 

Castleton’s 
back. 
Poole 
stood feet away 
with his phone in his hands, 
grinning as he recorded the 
scene.
Four 
scoreless 
minutes 
couldn’t quite tell what four 
minutes in the bowels of 
Williams Arena could.
Colin Castleton still has a 
long way to go, but on Thursday 
night, he showed he was hardly 
out of place.
“He’s got a great personality, 
team loves him,” Beilein said. 
“So it was a shot for him to 
just go in there and I think he 
affected some shots. He did a 
good job.”

Freshman center Colin Castleton got in the rotation with Brandon Johns out.

It’s a little play, 
but in my eyes, 
it’s a really big 
play.
