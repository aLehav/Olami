CENTRAL STUDENT GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS
Campaigns
could face
violations

University
Election Council
to hold nine
* hearings today
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
An individual affiliated with
the OurMichigan party has
made numerous allegations of
campaign violations against
the other parties running in the
Central Student Government
presidential and vice presi-
dential elections, according to
a document obtained by The
Michigan Daily last night.
The University Elections
Commission will hold nine
hearings today in response to
the alleged campaign viola-
tions, and there have been 15
complaints filed so far, which
can translate to demerits if

they violate UEC policy, elec-
tion director Peter Borock said.
If a candidate receives five
demerits; he or she is disquali-
fied from the election, and ifa
party receives 10 demerits, the
whole party and its candidates
are deemed ineligible.
Of the 15 complaints, two
have been issued as demerits,
one was dismissed,onehas been
withdrawn and the remaining
10 will be heard today. Borock
said the additional complaint
had been recently filed, and he
was unable to confirm details
about the grievance.
While he said he expects
the number of complaints to
increase before voting ends
tonight at 11:59 p.m., Borock
said many of the complaints
could fail to result in demerits.
"If you filed a complaint
for aliens coming down and

E-mail slams candidate

Hashwi defends
record in face of
allegations of
anti-Semitism
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
The highly contentious Cen-
tral Student Government elec-

tions turned personal yesterday
when an e-mail became widely
circulated that accused LSA
sophomore Omar Hashwi, a
current CSG vice presidential
candidate, of being an anti-
Semite and homophobe.
LSA sophomore Lauren Lei-
bach sentthe e-mail onTuesday
at about 10:30 p.m. to members
of the Delta Phi Epsilon soror-
ity, and the message was subse-
quently sent to other members

of the Greek community, ulti-
mately reaching the inboxes of
Haswi and his running mate,
Business junior Manish Parikh.
"Omar is not only publicly
anti-Israel, he is also openly
homophobic," Leibach wrote.
"Beyond the fact that someone
like him could be involved in
making important decisions on
campus, itisscary to think what
he could do with his power."
Leibach - who identified

herself as a member of the
American Movement for Israel,
a part of Hillel - continued,
discussing what she sees as
the implications of an election
victory by Hashwi and Parikh,
who are both running as inde-
pendents.
"Omar and Manish have a
lot of followers. It is frighten-
ing that they may have a good
chance in winning, and it is

DETROIT
Panel: Detroit in
"severe financial
emergency"
A review team appointed by
Gov. Rick Snyder to examine
Detroit's troubled finances deter-
mined yesterday that a "severe
financial emergency" exists in the
city, a finding that could lead to
the appointment of an emergency
manager should state and city
leaders fail to agree on an alterna-
tive solution in time.
Before the unanimous vote
clarifying the depths of Detroit's
fiscal problems, review team
member and former Michigan
Supreme Court Justice Conrad
Mallett Jr. said the city's "old way
of doing things has got to stop."
The panel's vote came one day
after an Ingham County judge
sidelined a state-appointed emer-
gency manager for the city of
Flint, putting the mayor and City
Council back in charge because of
open meetings violations. Michi-
gan officials criticized the Flint
ruling yesterday and pledged to
appeal.
BOULDER CITY, Nev.
Obama pledges to
* pursue promise of
clean energy
President Barack Obama says
that as long as he is in the White
House, the U.S. will continue to
pursue the promise of clean ener-
gy.
Speaking at a solar power facil-
ity, Obama says he will not stand
by and let countries like China or
Germany corner the market on
new energy technologies. He says
clean energy will not only reduce
America's dependence on foreign
oil, it also will create jobs in the
U.S.
Obama mocked Republicans
for having a lack of imagina-
tion and dismissing clean energy
technologies just because they
are new. The president says
America must take risks and stay
ahead of the curve in order to be
competitive.
TOULOUSE, France
Jewish leader:
Toulouse suspect
readied new attack
A French Jewish leader says
the gunman suspected in seven
recent killings and claiming alle-
giance to al-Qaida was about to
strike again.
Marc Sztulman of Jewish
group CRIF said President Nico-
las Sarkozy told community lead-
ers the suspect was ready to attack
again yesterday morning, before
French police decided to surround
his apartment building in the
southwestern city of Toulouse.
Twelve hours into the stand-

off between the gunman and
police, Sarkozy said the suspect is
still "surrounded by the forces of
order."
CAIRO
Egypt's Brother-
hood mulling run
for president
The Muslim Brotherhood,
Egypt's most powerful political
group, said yesterday it is consid-
ering running its own candidate
in upcoming presidential elec-
tions, dropping its previous deci-
sion to avoid direct participation
in the race.
The group appears to be play-
ing one of its last cards in a power
struggle against the ruling mili-
tary council, after it failed to
force the military to replace its
Cabinet with a new one appoint-
ed by the Islamist-dominated
parliament.
If a Brotherhood fields a can-
didate and wins the presidency,
the group would control the two
main branches of power. In par-
liamentary elections, the first
since a popular uprising unseat-
ed President Hosni Mubarak
last year, it won nearly half the
seats.

DOG THERAPY
From Page 1A
say how they miss their family
dog or how hard it was for them
to lose their dogs."
Farrehi said she rescued Tig-
ger from North Philadelphia a
few years ago, and she immedi-
ately realized Tigger's potential
to become a therapy dog due to
his friendly and calm demeanor.
"The human-animal con-
nection has been studied for
some time now," Farrehi said.
"We know pets can help reduce
stress, blood pressure and even
make us healthier."
Farrehi added that she start-
ed developing the program last
year and piloted "therapy dog
hours" in partnership with the
Counseling and Psychological
Services and College of Engi-
neering this academic year. The
official office hours program
was approved this semester,
Farrehi said.
"Students usually come to
visit Tigger when they are
stressed out and need to relax,"
Farrehi said. "The therapy dog
is there for students to pet and
interact with, and generally help
them feel good."
According to Farrehi, the
feedback from students has
been entirely positive and has
garnered enthusiasm around
campus from students of all aca-
demic disciplines.
"We joke that Tigger's paws

never hit the ground while he's
on campus because everyone
wants to hold him," Farrehi said.
"We've had such a wide range
of students, and Tigger is lov-
ingly referred to as 'Dr. Tiggs' by
many students."
Laura Blake Jones, associate
vice president for student affairs
and dean of students, said Tig-
ger provides the College of
Engineering with an innovative
approach for the COE to reach
out to students.
"There is a growing body of
research that supports the use of
pet therapy in medical settings
and schools," Jones said.
Jones added that pet therapy
is an effective way to supple-
ment conventional counseling
methods offered on campus.
"All those connections and
conduits to help get students
to the resources and having a
healthy campus community is
what we are about doing," Jones
said. "And this is an important
part of it."
Engineering Dean David
Munson said he believes many
mental problems commonly
affecting large communities
also impact University students.
"We are not immune. Men-
tal health issues are prevalent
and need to be de-stigmatized,"
Munson said. "We need to
be proactive and care for one
another. Fortunately, we have
outstanding resources on our
campus to assist in this effort."
A March 6 National Public

Radio story highlighted many
of the physical and psychologi-
cal therapeutic benefits students
can receive through spending
time with animals.
Rebecca Johnson, director of
the Research Center for Human-
Animal Interaction at the Uni-
versity of Missouri's Sinclair
School of Nursing, told NPR that
an individual's level of oxytocin
rises after an interaction with
animals.
Johnson pointed out that not'
only does oxytocin induces feel-
ings of joy within humans, it

brain's ability to heal and gener-
ate new cells.
Engineering senior Luree
Brown said her experience with
the therapy dog has been very
positive.
"You just look into his eyes,
and you instantly feel better,"
Brown said. "Dogs have an abil-
ity to tell your feelings, and he
returns the love that you need.
Mental healthiness is almost the
hardest healthiness to obtain,
however, Dr. Tiggs makes it
easy."
Brown added that a therapy
dog takes away the anxiety some
people have when seeking con-
ventional therapy.
"The therapy dog greets you
with excited wags of his tail,"
Brown said. "I think that he
has become a celebrity on cam-
pus now. People from all majors
(and) ages are lining up just to
have a session."

RECYCLING
From Page 1A
"We had a little bit of a blip
last year because a lot of people
were donating their used fea-
ture phones, wanting to buy new
smart phones," he said. "We had
to work down our inventory a
little bit, but we're back on the
growth curve and growing20-25
percent a year."
McKeown said the company
prefers "recommercing" the
phones they receive because it
allows for the reuse of old phones
instead of remakingnew ones.
"Recommercing is better than
recycling because it gives (cell
phones) a second or third life and
you won't have to make a new
one," he said. "Those phones
that are at the end of their useful
life, we recycle those with our
recycling partners. We're zero
landfill ... we audit our partners
so we make sure we have things
done the right way."
McKeown said the environ-
mental impact ReCellular has
made has been significant.
"We've saved hundreds of
thousands of pounds of landfill,"
he said. "We recycle enough
gold to make five to six thousand
wedding bands, and we recycle
enough copper to actually wrap
the Statue of Liberty."
Rita Loch-Caruso, aprofessor
in the School of Public Health
and the Department of Envi-
ronmental Health Sciences, said

improper disposal of electronic
devices can be hazardous to the
environment because they can
release potent chemicals into
the air.
"Among the many concerns,
electronic devices have toxic
chemicals that can get released
into the environment during
recycling," she said. "Exposure
of workers (in the recycling
industry) is also a concern."
Loch-Caruso explained that
many of the harmful chemicals
that electronics emit are "endo-
crine disruptors," which means
that they interfere with hor-
mones in humans and animals
and can result in a variety of
permanent developmental prob-
lems.
LSA senior Jennifer Thomas
said she switches phones when
her contract ends every two
years, and chooses to keep her
old phones rather than throw
them away or recyclingthem.
"I don't think I've ever
thrown (a cell phone) away,"
Thomas said. "I feel like I have
a stock pile at home ... I gave my
latest one to my nephew to play
with."
LSA junior Megan Cole
explained that while she recy-
cled her first phone herself, her
current carrier, AT&T, now recy-
cles her phones for her.
"When I was with Verizon
still, I took it to an electronic
recycler, but the second time
when I switched, AT&T took it at
the store," she said.

HEALTH CARE

said. "Everything we can do to
assure a higher level of insurance
for poor students is a good idea."
Winfield added that while
more than 3,000 students sub-
scribed to University-offered
insurance program a decade
ago when premiums were about
$1,000, only 1,350 students are
enrolled today as premiums are
now near $3,000.
"We are seeing people drop
out at the rate of 150 to 250 (stu-
dents) every year," Winfield said.
"We're facing this problem and
not yet sure how to solve it."
The UHS survey also found
that of the students who have
insurance coverage, 67 percent
responded that they were cov-
ered by their parents' plans,

while 30 percent said they were
not and 3 percent said they were
unsure. Of those who were cov-
ered by their parents' plans, 80
percent said they were covered
before the enactment of the
health care reform.
"Every time you manipulate
something, you change the cost
of the insurance, and students
are price-sensitive," Winfield
said. "I would prefer to see that
all students have to have a mini-
mum level of health insurance.
I think that is not explicit in the
ACA law, which says everybody
should have health insurance, but
the penalty is such that it doesn't
really rise to the level of feeling
mandatory."
Mark Fendrick, co-director of
the University's Center for Value-
Based Insurance Design, said one
of the most important facets of
the reforms is the free high-prior-

ity preventative care Americans,
including University students,
can now receive with no co-pay.
These "high-value preventive
treatments" include obesitycoun-
seling, immunizations, cholester-
ol screening, depression testing,
tobacco use counseling and tests
for sexually transmitted diseases,
according to Fendrick.
"It's been very exciting to see
a report from the Kaiser Fam-
ily Foundation that showed that
approximately 73 million Ameri-
cans between the ages of 0 and
64 have private coverage, and
because of this expansion of pre-
ventive services in the Affordable
Care Act, 54 million Americans
have access to high-value preven-
tive treatments that they did not
have before," Fendrick said.
In November, Fendrick was
invited by the offices of Sen. Tom
Harkin (D-Iowa) and Sen. Mike

Enzi (R-Wyo) to testify before the Affordable Care Act and the

"Yes, there are 10 hearings
scheduled, but that doesn't mean
there are 10 valid complaints or
any valid complaints."
Twenty-seven demerits have
already been issued to candi-
dates who missed a manda-
tory candidates' meeting. LSA
sophomore Louis Mirante, the
MForward vice presidential can-
didate, and LSA freshman Swati
Sudarsan, an MForward candi-

each received two demerits as
the result of a complaint filed by
members of youMICH concern-

tionally, MForward, as a party,
received two demerits as a result
of the violation of chalking pol-
icy, which concerns guidelines
for proximity of campaign chalk
material to other campaigns'
advertising.
Since presidential and vice
presidential slates are issued
demerits as a pair and not indi-

A diverse education
Arizona's policy hinders students' progress
merican citizens come from a wide variety of backgrounds,
and education about different cultures works toward a
more understanding and tolerant populace. However, the
recent ban of young adult author Matt de la Pena's novel "Mexican
WhiteBoy" from Mexican-American studies classes in high schools
in Tucson, Arizona prevents students from gaining knowledge and
appreciation of other cultures. Courses including ethnic studies
should be taught everywhere in the United States as cultural educa-
tion develops cognizance and appreciation.

Wall Street or Wehrmacht?

Three years ago, I began my
career in the Ross School of
Business, aiming to become
a successful
financier like
many others that
graduated from
the fine institu-
tion. After read-
ing Greg Smith's
op-ed piece in
The New York
Times last week, JASON
"Why I Am PANG JAO
Leaving Gold- _
man Sachs," I
gained some new perspectives.
Picture the following: You are
an unemployed, 21-year-old living
in Berlin in 1938. Your leader - the
man who promised to "repudiate
the versailles treaty, strengthen
the economy and provide jobs" -
requested your devotion and ser-
vice to the Wehrmacht just years
after the world's worst economic
recession. Your comrades are all
in your age group and came from
the same background: poverty, ill-
ness and a world devoid of hope
and happiness. Your job is simple:
For every bomb you drop from your
aircraft at the target sites you will
receive 1,000 Reichsmarks, which
is about the average nine-month
salary. In addition, you will receive
an additional 20,000 Reichsmarks
each year if your performance is
in the top fifth percentile of your
comrades. You know deep down
that what you are doing will result
in death and tragedy, but all of your
comrades are performing their
tasks diligently and competitively,
and you know that if you don't carry
out your mission, your position in
the Wehrmacht will be effectively
terminated. You and your family
will live a life in peace and prosper-
ity if you "just don't think too much
and do it."

Tempting? Now imagine all you
have to do to make, say, $50,000,
instead of dropping a bomb, is to
convince a client to buy a product
called a Collateralized Debt Obliga-
tion Cubed. You are not given infor-
mation about what it does, just that
it makes money and has some risks
involved that your clients should not
trouble themselves to understand.
Do you see how the lines can get
blurry in that type of culture? Greg
Smith, a former executive director at
Goldman Sachs, described this type
of toxic environment that pervades
the bank. In his controversial op-ed
in The Times, Smith explained his
reasons for quitting Goldman Sachs.
"To put the problem in the simplest
terms, the interests of the client
continue to be sidelined in the way
the firm operates and thinks about
making money," he said. Smith said
he could no longer accept the type
of environment that teaches junior
analysts that it's all right to call
their clients "muppets" and incen-
tivizes them solely on how much
they can make for the bank.
The deterioration of corporate
culture and personal integrity is not
an unaccustomed matter on Wall
Street. In the book "The Big Short:
Inside the Doomsday Machine,"
author Michael Lewis describes
the many questionable things that
investment bankers and traders
did prior to the 2008 financial cri-
sis, including creating and selling
unfathomable, and sometimes toxic,
financial products, using monetary
incentives to control rating agencies
and blatantly disregarding clients'
interests.
Get this. These arguably immoral
acts may appear to make the banks
money, but without their custom-
ers' trust and future business, these
bankers simply end up screwing
their shareholders, other firms
and themselves. A recent example

involves Bankers Trust, the star
quarterback of commercial banks
20 years ago. Though the bank had
stellar performance and was the
go-to bank at the time, people began
to uncover evidence that the bank-
ers were misleading their clients
by selling complex and overly risky
products. The executives at the
bank even coined the term "R.O.F.,"
which stands for rip-off factor. Soon
the company's profit started to dip.
In 1998, Bankers Trust pleaded
guilty to defrauding the State of
New York. Deutsche Bank later
acquired it.
The Goldman
op-ed changed
my perspective.
I wrote this article not to criti-
cize the banks for their past but
to address what they can change
now and in the future. Don't get
me wrong; investment banks are
essential for our economy. Without
them, there would be no one to take
care of financial transactions that
enable you to get mortgages and stu-
dent loans at reasonable rates, have
decent retirement plans or open
small businesses. But banks must
stop reinforcing this type of mis-
managed culture whereby people
narrow-mindedly focus on profit
numbers and ignore their clients'
interest. The Nazis stood on the
wrong side of history because they
couldn't see the forest through the
trees, but there is still much hope
for our financial system.

The ban on Mexican-American studies
coursesoriginatesfroma2010Arizonalawthat
forbids classes that "are designed for students
of one ethnic group or advocate ethnic solidar-
ity instead of treating pupils as individuals"
for these "advocate overthrowing the govern-
ment," the New York Times reported March 19.
Arizona has used this law to justify the ban of
Mexican-American studies courses "that are
perceived as anti-white." Though "Mexican
WhiteBoy" focuses on the main character's
desire to join his school's baseball team, state
officials accused the novel of "promoting racial
resentment." Many students in Arizona are
Latino - in Tucson's school district alone, the
number reaches 60 percent. According to the
2010 census, 29.6 percent of Arizona residents
and 16.3 percent of Americans have Hispanic or
Latino origins. The problem goes beyond Mex-
ican-American studies courses and is related
to the stance of the state's Republican majority
regarding immigration. Both sides participate
in this politically charged debate - in 2006,
labor activist Dolores Huerta gave a speech on
immigration at Tucson High School and said
that "Republicans hate Latinos," sparking a
backlash from the state education superinten-
dent and Republican lawmakers in the state.
Recent evidence shows that courses like
the ones at Tucson High School are actually

beneficial for students. An audit of the Mexi-
can-American studies program showed that
students who took courses in the program had
a greater likelihood of attending college and
that the classes worked to level disparities in
academic performance among students, The
Times reported. Any improvement in Ameri-
can education is a step in the right direction.
As of 2009, only three in four American high
school students was expected to graduate in
four years. Since the Mexican-American stud-
ies courses increase students' chances of going
to college, banning these courses is counter-
intuitive and could be detrimental to efforts to
improve education in America.
Tucson officials have also banned "text-
books, PowerPoint presentations, teachers'
college theses, exam prompts, poems and lyrics
from hip-hop songs" according to The Times.
School administrators confiscated hundreds
of copies of the banned books from classrooms
on pain of a $15 million penalty from the state.
This outrageous penalty is unfair to Tucson
schools and to the students.
Lawmakers need to repeal the 2010 Ari-
zona law, and the banned books ought to be
returned. In order to become informed and
well-rounded citizens, high-school students
need a diverse education appreciative of
other cultures.

Attacks on Hashwi create hostility
TO THE DAILY:
The Defend Affirmative Action Party condemns the
recent anonymous slander campaign against Central
Student Government representative and vice presiden-
tial candidate Omar Hashwi. This attack has a rac-
ist tone and is aimed at making a serious discussion
of the issues of the Middle East impossible. Attacks
of this kind create a hostile environment for all Arab
and Muslim students on the campus. All students,
CSG candidates and representatives who care about

academic freedom and maintaining a diverse student
body should condemn the demagogy, hysteria and
falsehood of these attacks on Omar Hashwi. Omar is
being attacked for defending the Palestinian right to
self-determination and criticizing the policies of the
Israeli government.
Students who agree with Omar and students who
defend the policies of the Israeli government must
have a right to voice their views on campus without
being the victims of demagogic attacks.

Detroi~t-'s disappointing mayor

Today, students across campus continue to
select their representatives for student govern-
ment for next year. It's no small wonder that so
many students to whom we have reached out
express common concerns about their student
government.Whetherthey'retired ofunrealis-
tic goals for campus initiatives, empty promis-
es or idealistic grandstanding, students across
campus will make their voices heard today.
And we've heard them say one thing loud and
clear: University students want their student
government to be a student government.
Our party, youMICH, has been dedicated
since day one to ensuring that Central Student
Government will work toward tangible goals to
improve campus life. With our executive slate
nomination of Shreya Singh and Ethan Hahn,
youMICH will provide the ideas, responsive-
ness and results that have been missing from
CSG. That's why we decidedto run for CSG
- to once again make student government all
about you.
Throughout our campaign, we've focused
on three major areas of the University expe-
rience where we can look after the needs of
students, providing positive action and real
results. our focus on academics - particu-
larly financial aid - centers on making the
University more affordable for students from
all walks of life. Rather than wasting time
passing pointless and doomed-to-fail reso-
lutions demanding lower tuition, youMICH
will work to streamline financial aid and
increase student awareness of the financial
aid process and resources available at the
University. We'll work to standardize proce-
dures across departments and increase the
number of career fairs and other employ-
ment-directed opportunities. And we'll work
to increase transparency and communication
between students and the University admin-
istration, advocating for more fireside chats
and town hall-style events.
Our focus on student organizations will
help campus groups optimize their efforts.
We'll continue Singh's streamlining of the
rolling funding process, making it more acces-
sible than ever before, especially for groups in
smaller colleges. We'll move forward with an
easy-to-use, accessible, all-campus calendar
for student organization events. We'll work
to foster cross-participation and coordination

among student groups on campus, particu-
larly for CSG events. Finally, we'll create more
large-scale events for student organizations,
like Festifall, to gain publicity around campus.
Our focus on the campus environment is
equally focused on addressing student needs
and concerns. One of our ideas, RateMyLand-
lord, an online discussion forum for off-cam-
pus housing, has gained so much traction that
several of our competitors have integrated it
into their platforms. Providing such a service
to students is an example of a common need
that can be addressed in a tangible way by CSG.
Similarly, focusing on relations among stu-
dents, the University's Department of Public
Safety and the Ann Arbor Police Department -
particularly relations in the Greek community
- and encouraging student engagement, dia-
logue and understanding of this relationship.
Student rights and common goals between all
parties involved can make our social environ-
ment on campus more enjoyable for so many
students. We'll improve our campus infra-
structure and transportation systems and con-
tinue CSG's legacy of bringing fantastic events
to campus.
Over the past few weeks, we've received
countless suggestions. We've been over-
whelmed by the outpouring of support from
student leaders across campus who are look-
ing for a pragmatic, realistic and results-driv-
en CSG executive - proof that our platform
resonates with the University community.
And while we've been flattered by our oppo-
nents adopting several of our key issues into
their platforms, we're excited that we've been
a catalyst in a campus-wide discussion about
the need to refocus CSG on real student needs
and concerns. We're glad that this election has
become all about you.
We've been honored to have so many of you
already pledge your support for our movement,
and for that, we thank you. As elections wind
down, we ask for your vote for our cause to
return student government back to its students,
and to make CSG an effective, pragmatic stu-
dent government once again.

for Central Student Government president. Ethan
Hahn is the youMICH candidate running for
Central Student Government vice-president.

As the 2008 presidential cam-
paign's rhetoric of hope
and change wound down,
another election began ina city with
very little hope
and in great need
of change. The
incompetent and
corrupt Detroit
Mayor Kwame
Kilpatrick was
preparing to
resign, the city's
finances were a MATTHEW
mess and resi- ZABKA
dents were leav-
ing the city at an
unprecedented rate.
Detroit Mayor David Bing's elec-
tion in 2009 brought with it pros-
pects of a turn-around in Detroit, but
his term has so far been a disappoint-
ment, and Bing's divisive rhetoric is
not helping the city.
Many saw Bing's election as a
fresh start, since the former Pistons
basketball star seemed to genuinely
care about Detroit. As other firms
were leaving Detroit, Bing founded
Bing Steel in 1980. At the time of his
election, Bing Steel had become the
Bing Group, an apparently success-
ful auto supplier, based in Detroit's
North End Neighborhood.
While this entrepreneurial
experience suggested that Bing
was well poised to take bold action,
Bing had actually left his former
company's finances a mess. Shortly
after he was sworn in as mayor, the
Bing Group laid off its workers and
was sold.
Bing's company's failure fore-
shadowed his term as mayor. He
and the Detroit City Council have
still not enacted real changes to put
the city's finances on solid footing.
For example, one of Bing's big-

gest proposals is the Detroit Works
project. This program is supposed
to relocate residents and consoli-
date city services to viable parts of
Detroit, but, after three years, no
major action has been taken.
Even the city's bookkeeping has
not improved. In January, Detroit
canceled several neighborhood
improvement programs after feder-
al officials found that the city didn't
have $53 million to spend on hous-
ing and development, but rather a
$53 million debt.
Without bold action, Detroit will
run out of money this spring. Since
a Detroit bankruptcy would affect
Michigan's credit rating, Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder assembled a finan-
cial review team that, over the past
several months, has advised Detroit's
government regarding its finances. It
has confirmed thatthe main driver of
Detroit's deficits is union contracts
that the city cannot afford.
Employee benefits eat up half
of the city's general fund. Health
care costs have risen by more than
60 percent since 2008, and the city
has a $5-billion liability for retiree
health benefits. This results in the
city using a larger proportion of its
budget each year for retirees who
no longer provide services to the
city. While Bing and the City Coun-
cil have enacted small cuts by laying
off some workers, without union
concessions for these rising legacy
costs, Detroit cannot balance its
budget. Detroit could lay off every
one of its employees and still have a
budget problem.
This is why last week, Snyder pro-
posed a consent agreement, which
would put a committee in charge
of Detroit's finances. The commit-
tee would work as an emergency
financial manager and oversee the

restructuring of Detroit's financ-
es and operations. As I've written
in a previous column, emergency
financial managers have the power
to amend union contracts to fix
Detroit's legacy costs. While this
committee would not be elected, the
alternative is bankruptcy, where a
judge - also not elected - would fix
Detroit's finances.
Bing and Snyder
must work
together for the
city and state.
Bing was not happy with Snyder's
proposal, calling the governor a
"liar" and "disingenuous." This rhet-
oric does not help Detroit, but Bing
is up for re-election next year, and
blaming Detroit's problems on out-
siders may be his attempt to pander
to voters.
Name calling shouldn't impress
voters, but working with the gov-
ernor to fix Detroit's finances will
give Bing a record on which to base
his re-election.
Bing has said, "I won't work
for the governor. I won't work for
that financial team of nine people.
I work for the people of the city of
Detroit because they voted me in to
do this."
He's right, but Bing was elected
three years ago, and Detroit expects
progress.

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
DailySports Writer
Maybe it was the 80-degree
heat. Maybe it was the home
crowd dressed in maize and blue.
Maybe it was because it was the
first home game. For whatever
reason,the Michigansoftball team
looked comfortable as it wrapped
up nonconference play with a 10-2
win over Eastern Michigan on
Wednesday night.
In a tumultuous first half of the
season, the 20th-ranked Wolver-
ines (18-9) had games where their
strengths were highlighted and
other days where their weakness-
es were exposed.
Early wins in February against
then-No. 22 LSU at the Tiger
Classic in Baton Rouge, La. and
then-No. 22 Kentucky at the FAU
Kickoff Classic in Boca Raton, Fla.,
exemplified the great play and
confidence that Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins has brought to the
program throughout her tenure.
The Wolverines continued their
hot streak at the Citrus Classic in
Lake Buena Vista, Fla. with wins
against No. 14 UCLA and No. 19
Auburn.
Soon after, the team hit an
offensive slump, losing four of six
games and scoring just six runs
during that stretch - including
a 5-1 loss to Illinois State, a team
' they beat earlier in the season.
"Our offense has been incon-
sistent and hasn't done its part,"
Hutchins said. "We had a nice

"Interestingly enough, our
pitching has been pretty darn
good, and our freshman have done
their part," Hutchins said. "Com-
ing into the season, that's not
something everybody expected."
Freshman right-hander Sara
Driesenga joins Wagner as the
other starting pitcher for Michi-
gan.
"I think the pitching staff has
done a great job as a whole," Wag-
ner said. "Whenever we get an
opportunity to come in and do our
part, we step up, and so far it is
working and it is going to continue
to work."
With the pitching success
ahead of schedule and the offense
slowly getting back into a rhythm,
the defense is the last component

nighttonight offensively, but some
nights are going to be tougher. But
the key is to stay within ourselves
as a team."
Wednesday night's victory
against the Eagles brought back
the confidence Michigan had at
the beginning of the season, and
the team is lookingto work off this
momentum as they enter into Big
Ten play this weekend.
"We play a really touch sched-
ule in the preseason and we can't
just come in there thinking, 'Oh,
just because we play Big Ten and
always do well at that, that we're
going to do well this year,' " said
senior first baseman Amanda

Chidester. "We have to come in
and keep competing and keep
playing to our best ability in each
game. It doesn't matter if it's Penn
State (or) Louisiana-Lafayette, we
have to play our game."
As they transition into the sec-
ond half of the season, the Wol-
verines will first look to Chidester,
senior center fielder Bree Evans
and junior second baseman Ashley
Lane to lead the team offensively.
It is no coincidence that all
three were named to the Watch
List for the 2012 USA Softball Col-
legiate Player of the Year award.
Chidester leads the team with
23 RBIs and 24 hits and is sec-

ond on the team with a .289 bat-
ting average. Evans is tied with
Chidester with 24 hits and leads
the team with 15 runs, with a .273
batting average. Lane leads the
team with seven home runs has 13
RBIs.
The Michigan offense doesn't
end with the upperclassmen trio.
Freshman catcher Lauren Sweet
leads the team with a .296 batting
average and has 21 hits.
"Everyone has their own little
thing that they need to focus on,
and if we all focus on those things
then we are going to be success-
ful," Chidester said.
With all of their offensive

That's the task the Michigan

ing Big Ten Freshman of the

of the season. Driesenga made
her case to be the replacement
for Taylor - Michigan wouldn't
have to go through a transition
year.
That changed quickly, as her
fellow freshman stepped into
the spotlight. Wagner earned
Big Ten Pitcher of the Week

putting up absurdly good num-
bers for a freshman - she went

Wagner also proved she was

the season.
Both pitchers showed prom-
ise to step up. But once the sea-
son progressed, the freshman
duo faced tougher competition.
Each tournament featured at
least one ranked opponent, and
when Driesenga struggled to
control her release, Wagner had
to come in relief.
Wagner continued to pile on
wins - she currently sits at 12-4
on the season - while Driesen-
ga faltered, and it became clear
who was number one.
But one dominant pitcher
isn't enough for the Wolverines
to have the kind of success they
want. And that dominant pitch-
er being a freshman is less than
ideal.

Don't get me wrong - the
softball team will continue its
success in the Big Ten and the
postseason. But if the Wolver-
ines want to avoid an early exit
in June, it won't be the hitting

The difference between a
good Michigan team and a great
one will be its freshman pitch-

Wagner and Driesenga have
shown that they can perform
at an exceptionally high level.
But they both have exposed
their vulnerabilities. Dries-
enga hasn't been able to fol-
low through in her release for
most of the season, and Wagner

shows frustration when she's
behind in the count - signs that
both of them still have room to
develop into confident, domi-
nant pitchers.
That confidence won't devel-
op immediately. But if the
Wolverines want to win the
conference title and earn a spot
in the Women's College World
Series, the freshmen duo will
have to learn to gain that confi-
dence soon and eliminate those
freshman mistakes.
The rest of the team trusts
Wagner and Driesenga in the
circle, and Michigan coach
Carol Hutchinstbelieves the
pitchers are on the right track
to develop their skills.
But it's not about what the
rest of the team thinks or how
much faith the coach has. It's all
about how Driesenga and Wag-
ner perform - and that's how
the Wolverines' softball season
will turn out.
It may sound like a lot riding
on the shoulders of an eighteen-
and nineteen-year-old, but if
Michigan wants to play ball into
June, the freshmen duo will be
the key.

But MICHIGAN 10
Hutchins
was pleased Wednesday night,
as the Wolverines recorded eight
hits - the first time since Feb. 25
- against Eastern Michigan (9-15
overall) in their home opener.
Senior first baseman Amanda
Chidester hit her fifth career
grand slam, senior center fielder
Bree Evans went 2-for-3 with
two hits and an RBI, and No. 20
Michigan (18-9) won in convinc-
ing fashion, 10-2 in five innings.
"I thought it was a team
effort, because it was everybody
- it wasn't just one person get-
ting a big hit," Hutchins said.
"(Chidester) doesn't get a grand
slam without runners on base.
"Having base runners tonight
was my favorite partofthe game."
The Wolverines had previously
struggled to capitalize with run-
ners on base this season. Michi-
gan has been able to get plenty of
runners on base but hasn't been
able to bring them in - the team
has left 167 runners onbase so far
this season.
But Wednesday night was dif-
ferent. Hits and runs started
pouring in during the first inning.
Evans led off with a double to
center field.
Another hit bysophomoreright
fielder Lyndsay Doyle and ascri-
fice bunt by Chidester putttwo in
scoring position for the Wolver-
ines, and junior Ashley Lane was
walked to load the bases. Things "
were off to a hot start for Michi-
gan, as it led 2-1 after one inning
at home.
It didn't stop there. The
Wolverines scored eight runs
in the third inning, including
Chidester's grand slam. Fresh-
man pitcher Sara Driesenga
began the scoring, hitting a two-
run a home run to extend Michi-
gan's lead, 4-1.
After the entire squad met Dri-
esenga and senior third baseman
Stephanie Kirkpatrick at home
plate while the crowd sang along
to "The Victors," it was back to
business.
Junior shortstop Amy Knapp
singled to left field, freshman
catcher Lauren Sweet walked and
sophomore Nicole Sappingfield
singled to right field to load the
bases.
Evans singled to bring in

Knapp, and Doyle was walked,
bringing in Sweet and loadingthe
bases once again.
Then came Chidester's hit.
Though her grand slam may
have been the highlight of
the game, both Chidester and
Hutchins know the matchup was
a genuine team effort - all but
one player recorded a hit.
"I think it was very much
(everyone doing their part
tonight)," Chidester said. "In the
beginning of the (first) inning,
Bree's part is to get on, she gets
on. Lyndsay's part (is to) move
her over or get on, (and she) did
both. It just continually hap-
pened throughout the entire
game. We had base runners on,
and people hit in. It was perfect."
Driesenga also contributed
to the team effort in her first
appearance since March 11, com-
pleting the five innings with
two runs - one earned - on
three hits, and pitching three
shutout innings. The righty has
been struggling as of late, but
Hutchins was impressed with
her improved command and fin-
ish.
"Sara did a nice job, and she's
worked very hard," Hutchins
said.
"She's had to work through
some adversity, and once you
get through adversity, it really
empowers you. She's on the right
track."

The Daily hockey beat projects the outcome of the NCAA Tournament.
Hockey bracketology

ByEVERETT COOK
Daily SportsEditor
As the NCAA Tournament
approaches, The Michigan Daily
hockey beat sat down and ham-
mered out the winners and los-
ers, seeing it out to the very end
in Tampa Bay, Fla. There were
some upsets, some favorites and
even some shouting matches. No
matter what we think, it's going
to be a crazy postseason.
NORTHEAST
First Round
(1) Boston College (29-10-1)
vs. (4) Air Force (21-10-7): Air
Force has played Boston College
five times in program history
and has lost all five times. Don't
expect anything different this
time around - the Eagles are the
No. 1 overall seed and have won
15 straight games.
Pick: Boston College
(2) Minnesota-Duluth (24-9-
6) vs. (3) Maine (23-13-3): The
No.1 point-scorer in the country,
Maine's Spencer Abbott, goes
against the No. 2 point-scorer in
the country, Minnesota-Duluth's
Jack Connolly, and both teams
have three players each in the
top 20. Having six of the top 20
point-scorers in the nation play-
ing in one game certainly makes
things interesting, but the Bull-
dogsrhave the experience from
last year's title run.
Pick: Minnesota-Duluth
Second Round
Boston College vs. Minnesota-
Duluth: The Eagles will have the

the difference here.
Pick: Boston College
WEST
First Round
(1) North Dakota (25-12-3) vs.
(4) Western Michigan (21-13-
6): Western Michigan went into
the CCHA Tournament on the
bubble of the NCAA Tourna-
ment, needing to string together
some big wins to earn a spot.
The Broncos ended up winning
the whole thing, and have a full
head of steam headed into the
Tournament. They have a fresh-
man goalie, Frank Slubowski
with a cool nickname, The Big
Slubowski (if you don't get the
reference then you don't know
good cinema), and he has been
on an absolute tear. If there was
a No. 4 seed to upset a No. 1 seed,
it's this game. If Western had
drawn say Union or Michigan,
they would have had more of a
shot, but North Dakota is a hor-
rible matchup for the Broncos.
Pick: North Dakota
(2) Minnesota (26-13-1) vs.
(3) Boston University (23-14-1):
Minnesota has a fairly deceiv-
ing record - of its 13 losses, nine
have been by one goal. The Gold-
en Gophers are basically playing
a home game at the Xcel Energy
Center in Saint Paul. The Terri-
ers have been inconsistent and
have lost three of their past five
games.
Pick: Minnesota
Second Round
North Dakota vs. Minneso-

ta: Without the home-ice, this
matchup wouldn't be as close.
North Dakota doesn't have great
goaltending, but is balanced
offensively and has a ton of expe-
rience.

not have the depth in pitching or

The Buckeyes rely on their
stars to carry them, such as
pitcher Mikayla Endicott, who
carries a 1.85 ERA. The rest of
the Buckeye pitching staff has
given up 43 earned runs.

The arcade's themed pinball machines include "Star Trek" and "Tron." LISON aily
Pi l

In an age of
consoles, Pinball
Pete's still thrives
ByKAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
Daily Arts Writer
The presence of Pinball Pete's
on South University Avenue is a
real head-turner for passers-by.
The hot-pink awning, flashing
lights, and the buzzers and bells
of pinball games all combine to
entrance us into cleaning out our
pocket change battling the Bal-
rog in the "Lord of the Rings"
pinball game. But the real rea-
son for a double take is, "How in
blazes is an arcade still in opera-
tion?"
After all, arcades are an insti-
tution as antiquated as book-
stores and Blockbusters, even
for Ann Arbor. We now live in
a society in which "gaming"
means temple-running and
launching birds with a flick
of the finger, where kids are
weaned on Wiis and "Call of
Duty" team deathmatches. Yet,
for over 30 years, Pinball Pete's
has endured. While much of
the arcade industry has seen a
precipitous decline in business,
Pinball Pete's has persistently
evolved to succeed and continue
as the last bastion of old-school
gaming in the region.
This propensity to adapt has
been in Pinball Pete's DNA since
its inception. It started in 1973,
when East Lansing native Ted
Arnold and his two elder broth-
ers, all pinball fanatics, pooled
their money together to buy and
refurbish a used pinball machine.
Arnold was just eight years old at
the time, and his brothers were
only teenagers. At first, they only
shared the machine with close
friends, but it soon became the
talk of the town.
"Soon, neighborhood kids
wanted to come over and play
pinball too," Arnold said. "After
school, we'd have about 20 bikes
in the driveway."
A new venture was born -
charging a dime for a game and
a quarter for three, the budding
entrepreneurs started saving
money to boost their business.
Next came aCoca-Cola machine,
followed by a candy counter and
another pinball machine. After
a year and a half, the broth-
ers were running a full-fledged
mom-and-pop operation in their
garage.
Then, the mighty ham-
mer of government bureau-
cracy struck. A city inspector
demanded the brothers cease
and desist their operation, since
they were running a business in
a residential area. But the broth-
ers were ready to run a business
full time, briefly shifting opera-
tions to Monroe, Mich. before
returning to their hometown to
open a proper storefront. Their
first East Lansing location was
in a former doughnut shop with
a life-size fiberglass elephant on
the roof. Here, the pink pachy-
derm logo of Pinball Pete's was
* immortalized.
"We said, 'If we're going to
run this arcade, how are we
going to get people to notice?' "

Arnold said. "'What if we went
up there and painted that ele-
phant pink?"'
Their initial plan was to enlist
their mother to make a paper-
Smbchd cowboy, who would have
been the eponymous Pete, to sit
on the elephant.
"We went up and painted the

elephant pink and had a few cer- games were crucial additions,

high-profile celebrity
death always casts
solemn silence and a
shadow over sunny Hollywood.
For weeks, these incidents turn
the eyes of
America to
the lives of
such celebri-
ties. Their
triumphs
are praised,.
their troubles
are exposed, HALEY
and the true
causes of GOLDBERG
their deaths
are scruti-
nized endlessly on programs like
"E! News" and coverage on CNN.
The media explosion after
Whitney Houston's death on Feb.
11 was no exception. Houston was
found dead in the Beverly Hilton
Hotel, where she was staying
to celebrate the 54th Grammy
Awards in Los Angeles the day
before the event. Upon the dis-
covery of her passing, a media
firestorm instantaneouslybegan.
Tweets from celebrities and fans
alike began flooding the Twit-
tersphere with the news of the
pop diva's death, and according
to TopsyLabs.com, there were
"2,481,652 tweets and retweets"
in the first hour after her death
was announced.
And now, as the initial buzz
following Houston's sudden
death - the cause of which
has yet to be determined - has
faded, we have to wonder about
the motives of Warner Bros. in
"honoring" the singing legend by
re-releasing a famous movie she
starred in, "The Bodyguard," to
theaters on March 28 for a limit-
ed engagement in more than 400

PINBALL WIZARD
From Page 1B
Media savvy
Tomorrow night, more than 40
years after the album premiered,
the revisited and overhauled
"Tommy" will be presented by
MUSKET, the University's only
student-run musical-theater
organization. As MUSKET pre-
pares to unveil its 21st-century
version of "Tommy," director
Taylor Norton, a School of Music,
Theatre & Dance freshman, dis-
cussed the advantages and com-
plexities that revamping such a
popular show entailed.
"In the original show, Cap-
tain Walker is a pilot in the
British army," Norton said. "So
what is he in America in 2001?
There needed to be an event
that spurred Captain Walker's
release, so the whole show hing-
es around the 'Mission Accom-
plished' speech that Bush gave in
2003."
Finding appropriate backsto-
ries for characters was just the tip
of The Who-sized iceberg. Due to
the rock musical's concept-album
beginnings, connecting the mul-
tiple layers present in the origi-
nal work has been a challenge
from the show's first production,
no matter the time and place in
which the show is situated.
"Trying to highlight the
moments that aren't about a huge
rock show, the moments where
there's really something happen-
ing between two people onstage
- even if it's something horrific
- how do we communicate it
without it being uncomfortable?"
Norton said. "How do we tell the
story rather than demonstrating
(it) onstage?"
In keeping with the theme of
modernity, the 21st century is
woven into the show: Not only do
characters carry cell phones and
iPods, but the back wall of the
set will also be a series of muslin
screens onto which video clips
will be projected.
The reason behind the mar-
riage of social media and rock
opera is the intense cultural
connection people have with
the Internet today: Sites such as
Twitter, Facebook and YouTube
allow ordinary individuals to
skyrocket to fame overnight. The
show portrays Tommy as a You-
Tube phenomenon, made famous
instantaneously for his skills
playing pinball.
"The idea of Tommy as a You-
Tube sensation really clicked for
me because it happens all the
time, and it happens instantly, so
we're using the projections to pull
from the media," Norton said.
"Sure plays a mean pinball"
MT&D senior Lance Fletke
plays war veteran Captain
Walker, Tommy's father. After
he murders his wife's lover, Cap-
tain Walker must deal with the
fallout of his actions: Tommy
is traumatized after witness-
ing this struggle and becomes
catatonic. Throughout the show,
Captain Walker tries to resolve
his relationship with his son and
his wife, wanting to return to the
pre-war familial life he shared

with them.
"He's a murderer, and (though)
he got away with it, he's trauma-
tized his son," Fletke said. "But
through it all, his main goal is to

come back to this woman that got
him through the war, to reconcile
and fall back in love with Mrs.
Walker."
Captain Walker soon learns
that it is not as simple as apolo-
gizing and moving forward. As
Tommy grows older, hope for a
cure is sparse. He and Mrs. Walk-
er continue to take Tommy from
doctor to doctor, hoping that a
new therapy or medicine is avail-
able for their son.
"You can never really have
what you've lost, but you can
have something different, some-
thing new, and so, to do that,
he's trying to get his son better,"
Fletke said. "There's a lot of guilt
there, not only with killing the
lover and affecting Tommy but
also from the war. Captain Walk-
er is very laden down with guilt,
and so he's trying to find a way
to peel that off and live a typical,
normal life."
Despite the setbacks and trag-
edies Tommy has faced, he has a
secret that begins to set in motion
his recovery: As one of the songs
describes, he is a "Pinball Wiz-
ard." After discovering his tal-
ent for pinball, Tommy becomes
a YouTube sensation, garnering
him fans and recognition every-
where.
Uplifting in music and tone,
"Pinball Wizard" brings the
spirit and energy of The Who
to the stage with inspiring lyr-
ics and catchy beats, reminding
audience members of how very
rock 'n' roll the musical is.
"In the show, 'Pinball Wiz-
ard' is a huge number - a lot of
dancing, movement. And that's
the point: It's a huge,, climactic
moment when you discover this
kid you thought was helpless
is actually this god of a pinball
player," Fletke said. "Anything
that happens at the end of Act
One is important because it sets
the tone for Act Two, and so then
(inActTwo), Tommy'sgrownup
and he's this pinball wizard. It's
a big party scene."
A song of strife
Along with the larger-
than-life sequences, there are
moments in "Tommy" that
require tenderness and delicacy
on the part of the actors and the
audience. LSA junior Rachel
Gubow, who plays Mrs. Walker,
described the necessity of the
intense scenes that occur in the
show.
"We see murder, abuse, drugs
and bullying," Gubow said.

"Delving into those things and
understanding them allows the
character to have passions and
regrets and troubles, and that's
what makes it interesting to
watch."
In order to convey the darker
elements of the story, "Tommy"
turned to media once again. By
projecting pre-recorded clips
such as the abuse scene involv-
ing babysitter Uncle Ernie and
10-year-old Tommy, the show was
able to utilize its technological
motifs as well as convey a power-
ful image to the audience.
In the scene, Tommy, dressed
in all white, sits in a chair while
the looming figure of Uncle Ernie
in a business suit stands eerily
behind him. Ernie puts a hand on
Tommy's shoulder as a represen-
tation of the abusive relationship
between the young boy and his
uncle. The audience can extrapo-
late the rest of the scene without
witnessing it, and the show relies
on this understanding on the part
of the audience.
"For us now, we understand
so much more about the cycle of
violence and sexual abuse," Nor-
ton said. "We don't have to go so
far and be abrasive with those
moments because everyone will
understand them."
According to Gubow, the

greatest difficulty in conveying
emotion during the show's more
intense moments lies in getting
past the music and focusing on
the lyrics.
"It's easy to sing what's writ-
ten, but finding the meaning
behind all those lyrics is the chal-
lenge," Gubow said.
"When you're given a script
of lines, there's no set melody to
say the lines to. You get to inter-
pret the speed, your inflection,
and you put meaning behind
them. But when the lyrics are set
to a song with a specific melody,
it takes a lot more effort to put
intent behind them - to not just
sing a pretty song, but mean it,"
she added.
During "I Believe My Own
Eyes," a song Townshend wrote
especially for the musical, there
is a scene between Captain and
Mrs. Walker that Fletke noted
for its misleadingly upbeat music
covering for a brewing inten-
sity between the married couple.
Though it's easily sung as a large
number, when probed further,
it uncovers the demise of a rela-
tionship and the desire to bring it
back.
"It's a big, sweeping song that
you can get caught up in, when
really, all they're doing is having
a fight (and) trying to find some

common ground.
"It's not a big ballad; it's that
we'rebeinginvestedinone anoth-
er and trying to help our kid," he
added. "It's about remembering
(that) lyrics come first. It's our job
as storytellers to piece everything
together: All these things bring
light to the stories we're trying to
tell and the people we portray."
Putting the'rock'in
rock 'n' roll
To help the story unfold with-
out succumbing to the vastness
of the music, the set was created
to portray the inside of Tommy's
mind. Along with the projection
screens, the set boasts an array of
newspaper clippings, photos and
memories from Tommy's child-
hood that link the scenes happen-
ing onstage to the setting of the
show.
"You walk onto the set, and you
walk into Tommy's mind," Norton
said. "It's like a control room, and
all the colors are subdued, and the
projections on the back wall will
also have old media on it. You see
pictures of Tommy's first steps,
newspaper clips that have to do
with 'Tommy.' ... It will be a col-
lage of things that have to do with
the show."
But the premise of the rock

opera is an album: a really loud,
jamming album. Rather than
trying to convince the audience
that this rock musical can stand
alone without The Who, Norton
said the goal of the production is
to incorporate rock and emotion
into one excitingshow.
"We're trying to remember
that this is a rock 'n' roll show,
and as much as you want it to be
a musical, it can't be, so we're
trying to highlight the plot we've
created and tying loose ends
together, and then letting the big
rock moments that everyone loves
kind of explode and take over,"
Norton said.
To get the people excited at
the right moments in the perfor-
mance, Norton explained that
there will be surprises and excit-
ing additions for the audience,
such as Tommy's YouTube fan-
girls appearing in the audience
and interacting with the charac-
ters onstage.
"There's a lot of stuff happen-
ing in the audience, because we
really want to have the feel of a
rock show," Norton said. "With
the way we have crazy fangirls
from the show run up to the stage
from the audience, or the way we
shoot T-shirts into the crowd, we
will hopefully be able to reel the
audience in."
