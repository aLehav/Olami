ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily

The University of Michigan Board of Regents voted to remove the name of the C.C. Little Science Building Thursday afternoon.

RESEARCH

Board votes unanimously to change names of C.C. Little, West Quad’s Winchell Hall

The 
 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization filled the room of 
The University of Michigan Board 
of Regents March meeting, as the 
board voted to remove the names 
of the C.C. Little Science Building 
and West Quad Residence Hall’s 
Winchell 
House 
on 
Thursday 

afternoon. Before the meeting, LEO 
hosted a grade-in with around 75 
lecturers packing the lobby of the 
Michigan Union and their assembly 
did not go unnoticed, with several 
regents responding to their calls for 
higher wages and greater benefits 
during the meeting.

The meeting room had about 40 

people in attendance with additional 
overflow congregating in a separate 
viewing room. Regents Michael 
Behm, D, Shauna Ryder Diggs, D, 
and Denise Ilitch, D, attended the 
meeting by telephone.

C.C. Little and Winchell House 

renaming

The calls from the student body 

and faculty to remove the names of 
problematic figures from the C.C. 
Little building and Winchell House 
have carried on for years, with 
recent protests and forums bringing 
the issue to the forefront of campus 
conversation.

After two separate petitions 

to rename the buildings were 
proposed last year, the President’s 
Advisory Committee on University 
History began its deliberations 

on the figures the buildings were 
named after, diving into primary 
documents and weighing the impact 
these figures on current students.

Little, a former president of the 

University, was a strong supporter 
of 
the 
eugenics 
movement, 

perpetuating 
the 
ideology 
of 

removing “unwanted traits” from 
the gene pool through ethnic quotas 
and anti-immigration legislation. 
He was also a large supporter of 
the tobacco industry, which the 
committee found to be in opposition

Regents vote to remove building 
names, discuss LEO bargaining

In late March 1965, more 

than 3,000 people gathered on 
the University of Michigan’s 
Ann Arbor campus to protest 
and 
discuss 
United 
States 

involvement in the Vietnam 
War. 
The 
overnight 
event, 

which included lectures, music, 
informational movie screenings 
and more, was the brainchild of 
several University professors who 
had been growing increasingly 
frustrated with the escalation of 
conflict in Vietnam. Originally, 
the professors had planned to 
stage a strike, but concerned 
about administrative backlash, 
they instead planned 12 hours 
of campus-wide learning and 
activism.

Though 
controversial, 
the 

event, 
dubbed 
a 
“teach-in,” 

proved 
very 
impactful. 
The 

idea was rapidly adopted by a 
multitude of other colleges and 
universities. Similar teach-ins 
appeared across the country over 
the next several years.

More than 50 years later — 

as part of University President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 
Academic 

Innovation Initiative — the Office 
of Academic Innovation and a 

group of collaborators decided 
to revamp the teach-in idea by 
bringing it online.

Schlissel officially announced 

last March that the Office of 
Academic 
Innovation 
would 

be releasing a series of online 
learning experiences through 
Coursera and edX. The initiative, 

called the Teach-Out Series, 
consists of modular mini-courses 
featuring 
interviews, 
written 

pieces and other informative 
multimedia 
from 
University 

experts. Each Teach-Out extends 
over a few hours of content about 
a timely topic over the course of a 
week, then participants are asked 

to answer questions and discuss 
the material.

Coursera and edX are Massive 

Open Online Courses, also known 
as MOOCs. These web-based 
educational platforms allow users 
to disseminate ideas more quickly 
than in a physical classroom. Since 

Two 
weeks 
ago, 
LSA 

sophomore 
Lauren 
Fokken, 

a student at the University of 
Michigan, sent a Snapchat of 
herself 
and 
another 
student 

in black face masks captioned 
“#blacklivesmatter.” The photo 
was screenshotted and circulated 
around social media, with the 
incident receiving attention from 
many students on campus who 
deemed it as blackface and racist.

Since then, there has been little 

progress from the University 
and the Bias Response Team in 
addressing the occurrence and 
the students involved. However, 
student groups and leaders have 
commented 
on 
having 
more 

discussion 
surrounding 
racist 

incidents.

Speaking on what it means 

to be a person of color abroad, 
the University of Michigan’s 
Office of Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs hosted a talk Thursday 
night in North Quad Residence 
Hall featuring a diverse group 
of 
panelists 
who 
provided 

anecdotal stories of how their 
race shaped their experiences 
both 
studying 
and 
serving 

abroad. 
About 
50 
students 

and faculty members were in 
attendance at the event, which 
was also sponsored by the 
International Center, Spectrum 
Center and the Center for Global 
and Intercultural Study.

The talk focused on students 

of color experiences abroad and 
highlighted the small percentage 
of students of color who study 
abroad compared to 71.6 percent

Richard 
and 
Susan 
Rogel 

committed a $150 million gift 
to the University of Michigan 
Comprehensive Cancer Center, 
according to a University press 
release 
announced 
Thursday. 

This donation is the single largest 
ever given to Michigan Medicine 
and one of the largest given to the 
University, making the couple 
the second largest donor to the 
University.

To 
recognize 
the 
Rogels’ 

commitment to the University, the 
Board of Regents unanimously 
approved a renaming of the 
center in the couple’s honor on 
Thursday. The gift will allow for 
collaborative research in cancer 
care and will work to draw in 
top researchers from around the 
globe to the University.

With this most recent gift, 

the Rogels have donated $188.5 
million to over 17 areas of the 
University. Richard Rogel will 
serve as the co-chair of the 

Victors for Michigan National 
Campaign Leadership Board, the 
University’s $4 billion fundraising 
campaign which is currently 
chaired by Stephen M. Ross — 
the University’s largest donor — 
along with his other positions as 
the chair of Michigan Medicine 
Victors for Michigan and Victors 
for Michigan Global Student 
Support Committee. He also 
serves on many other advisory 
boards across the University. 
Susan Rogel serves on multiple 
medical and alumni committees 
as well.

The Rogels’ motivation to 

contribute to cancer research 
stems from the way cancer hit 
their family, said the release. 
Richard Rogel, motivated by the 
loss of his father from pancreatic 
cancer, said he hopes for new 
research which will develop 
earlier 
detection 
and 
better 

treatment for patients. Susan 
Rogel lost her parents to cancer, 
and the couple lost their daughter 
Ilene to a particularly vicious form 
of lung cancer five years ago. The

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA freshman Zayna 
Syed wrote about the epidemics of alcoholism and drug addiction 
and their manifestations on campus.

“It was definitely shocking to see the lack of treatment. It’s a public 
health issue that I don’t feel like gets talked about very much. Opioid 
addiction has been brought up in presidential debates, it’s been a hot 
topic the last few years, but what’s really not talked about is alcohol 
addiction, especially in college, and how the culture of heavy drinking 
normalizes addiction. Something really interesting someone said was 
a lot of times people don’t find out they’re addicts until after they leave 
college. They’ll be drinking heavily with their friends, and after they’re 
graduate, they’re like, ‘Okay, I should probably stop.’ But then they 
try and stop, and they find it’s very difficult. Another thing I think is 
important to distinguish is alcohol addiction in general is very different 
from just drinking a lot. People who are addicts have some sort of 
chemical imbalance that physically makes them want it. Writing the 
story was definitely difficult to grapple with, because I think we as a 
nation have failed a lot of people.”

LSA freshman Zayna Syed, “Students, addiction specialists call for 
culture shift on alcohol, drug addiction”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
When someone greets me with an enthusiastic ‘Go 

Blue’ I can relate. I do go blue. I go blue when I look at my 
paystubs, and I go blue when I think about my first two 
years here when I had to eat all of my meals on the floor 
because I couldn’t even afford a couch. I go blue when I 
think of last summer, when I lived under the impending 
fear of eviction because I couldn’t keep up with my rent, 
and before anyone forgets, again, I work three jobs.“

Victor Rodriguez-Pereira, Lecturer I in Romance Languages and Literatures Department, tutor, barista

2012, the University has been 
experimenting with translating 
classes and educational content 
into online modules. In fact, 
the University was one of the 
first partners of Coursera and 
affiliated itself with edX in 2015.

The first Teach-Out, focused 

on the transition from democratic 
to 
authoritarian 
rule, 
was 

published on March 31, 2017. 
The release date was a nod to the 
first teach-in, which took place 
overnight starting on March 24, 
1965.

The Teach-Outs have now 

been running for a year. James 
DeVaney, associate vice provost 
for 
Academic 
Innovation, 

believes the series has had a 
positive impact so far.

“We are off to a terrific start 

after one year of Teach-Outs,” 
DeVaney wrote in an email 
to The Daily. “Nearly 60,000 
participants from around the 
world have engaged in these 
global 
community 
learning 

events 
where 
scale 

meets 
social 
learning 

and multidirectional interaction 
is facilitated around timely topics 
of widespread interest.”

Ten Teach-Outs have been 

released since last March on 
issuesranging from social justice 
to sleep deprivation to virtual 
reality. DeVaney says the Office 
of Academic Innovation gathers 
topic proposals from faculty, 
University 
organizations 
and 

Academic 
Innovation 
team 

members.

Physics professor Tim McKay 

is one of the series’ founders 
and also co-led the “Privacy, 
Reputation 
and 
Identity 
in 

a Digital Age” Teach-Out in 
January 2018. He thinks the 
Teach-Out idea was sparked 
by the culmination of several 
factors, including the University’s 
tradition, the rise of MOOCs and 
a growing sentiment of social 
responsibility.

“Here we had this heritage of 

teaching in the moment, getting 
campus experts out to talk to 
people, and this new way of doing 
it, these massive open online 
courses,” McKay said. “There 

was, I think, a year ago, a renewed 
sense on campus that current 
affairs called for more input from 
the academic world.” 

The 
name 
“Teach-Out” 

originates from “teach-in,” but 
conveys the broader impact of 
the new learning series. McKay 
believes the online platform of the 
Teach-Outs differentiates them 
from teach-ins in that they are 
more accessible to people outside 
the world of academia. According 
to McKay, Teach-Outs are special 
because they reach non-academic 
audiences who might not have as 
much experience with a topic.

“The only drawback of a teach-

in is that we only talk to each 
other, like here on campus, and 
we do that a lot anyway,” McKay 
said. “It’s not going to change the 
world, to do a teach-in.”

As with the teach-ins of the 

’60s and ’70s, the Teach-Outs 
are founded on the principle 
of translating the University’s 
brainpower into positive impact. 
Academia is often criticized 
as being elitist or disengaged, 
but Teach-Out leaders say the 
series allows the academy to 
share its knowledge with larger 

audiences. 
Wallace 
House 

Director Lynette Clemetson 
led a recently released Teach-
Out 
called 
“Free 
Speech 

in 
Journalism,” 
and 
she 

agrees with the sentiment of 
increased accessibility.

“The kinds of conversations 

that you would have in a 
rigorous 
academic 
setting 

don’t have to be confined to 
the campus itself,” Clemetson 
said. “The experts and the 
topics and the research and the 
pursuit of people who are part 
of the University should not 
be just kept within the walls 
of the University. It’s very, I 
think, anti-ivory tower.”

The Office of Academic 

Innovation agrees that the goal 
of the series is to extend the 
University’s reach. DeVaney 
wrote that in publishing the 
Teach-Outs, 
the 
office 
is 

trying to “reimagine public 
engagement.” 

So 
far, 
the 
Teach-Out 

series has been accessed by 
60,000 people from more than 
100 countries. The Teach-
Outs are marketed through 

Coursera and edX, which already 
have plenty of active users, and 
by advertisements sent to the 
University’s alumni network.

The 
majority 
of 
people 

participating in the Teach-Outs, 
at least in McKay’s experience, are 
not affiliated with the University. 
Many learners are just people 
who have an internet connection 
and want to join the conversation.

According 
to 
Clemetson, 

the Teach-Outs attract people 
who genuinely want to discuss 
impactful topics and learn from 
others.

“There is a target audience 

there, who not only wants to 
connect with the information, 
but also wants to connect with 
a community of people who are 
similarly interested in learning 
about the topic,” Clemetson said.

Due to the series’ broad 

international 
presence, 

participants have a wide array of 
experiences. The first Teach-Out, 
which focused on the transition 
from democratic to authoritarian 
rule, drew comments from people 
who had lived or who currently 
live 
under 
an 
authoritarian 

government. 
McKay 
thinks 

the 
diverse 
perspectives 
on 

authoritarian rule enriched the 
conversation.

One core characteristic of the 

Teach-Outs is an emphasis on 
social responsibility. The Teach-
Outs are meant to facilitate 
conversation 
about 
relevant, 

current issues, from the rise of 
“fake news” to concerns about 
online identity and personal data.

McKay says all Teach-Out 

topics are inspired by current 
events, but the nature of each 
Teach-Out’s timeliness varies.

“The 
timeliness, 
you 
can 

think about it in different scales,” 
McKay said. “So, free speech 
— clearly a timely issue. Timely 
this week? Maybe not. But in this 
year, or this season, or now, yes, 
very timely. They have different 
paces, so as the office has learned 
how to produce these, they’re 
working with that, and trying 
to figure out, you know, a way to 
generate a steady flow of these in 
a way that really works.”

with The Daily, discussed actions 
the University has taken to address 
the incident. LSA sophomore 
Corrina Lee suggested a workshop 
for government representatives 
to better understand race and 
racism, especially with regards to 
racism on campus. 

“It’s being treated as an OSCR 

(Office 
of 
Student 
Conflict 

Resolution) 
violation 
of 
the 

Student 
Code 
of 
Conduct,” 

Schlissel said. “I think the way it 
will resolve is with some type of 
restorative justice but that really 
depends upon the people who 
brought forward the complaint 
and then the willingness of 
the students themselves who 
committed (this) really pretty 
terrible 
and 
offensive 
Snap, 

whether they’re in a place where 
they can learn from this and be 
remediated.”

With regard to racist incidents 

happening on campus in the past 
year, Schlissel wants to focus on 
having established structures for 
investigation and punishment.

“My job is to make sure that 

we have structures established 
and the right set of rules to make 
sure when bad events do happen, 
we can investigate them, attempt 
to figure out who’s responsible 
and then, once we’ve done that, 
find the appropriate punishment, 
be it restorative justice or on the 
other extreme, sanctions against 

the people who are responsible,” 
Schlissel said.

The LSA Student Government 

has also recently discussed taking 
action within LSA SG and on 
campus to tackle bias incidents in 
general, including the blackface 
incident.

And yet, student employees 

at Victors café have been left 
feeling their voices are not being 
heard after having been left 
out of the loop with regard to 
the investigation and Fokken’s 
employment status. Employees 
say Victors management has 
done little to address the incident 
and has not updated student 
employees about whether or not 
Fokken is still an employee. An 
anonymous 
Victors 
employee 

said they believed Fokken was 
still 
employed, 
though 
the 

circumstances are unclear.

“We don’t know the status 

of her employment,” the source 
said. “However, all of us here 
believe it sounds like she’s still 
hired. The dining workers said 
they can’t give an update on 
her employment, but one of my 
coworkers went down and told 
them we don’t feel comfortable 
with her working here.”

The source also said Fokken 

sent an apology email to all 
Victors staff through a work 
portal, but said it came across as 
insincere.

“She 
issued 
an 
apology,” 

the source said. “However, it 
didn’t quite look sincere and it 
made quite a few of us mad. It 
seemed like someone told her to 

apologize and basically wrote it 
for her.”

Victors 
manager 
Gerry 

Heiden declined to comment on 
Fokken and the incident.

“It 
honestly 
feels 
like 

they’re brushing it off still,” 
the anonymous source said. 
“The process is slow in general, 
but it feels like there’s no 
consequences. 
We 
feel 
like 

there were no consequences 
and she got away fairly easily, 
however, we don’t know the final 
outcome.”

Although 
he 
could 
not 

comment on specific details of 
the case without permission from 
Fokken, University spokesman 
Rick Fitzgerald said in an email 
interview BRT has been working 
to address the incident and 
extend assistance to students 
affected by the Snapchat.

“In 
this 
instance, 
the 

Bias Response Team offered 
support services to individuals 
impacted by the Snapchat post 
and to the specific individuals 
who reported the post as a 
bias 
incident,” 
Fitzgerald 

wrote. 
“Housing 
Diversity 

and 
Inclusion 
staff 
reached 

out to impacted residents at 
Mosher Jordan Residence Hall. 
In addition Michigan Dining 
professional staff have been in 
communication with impacted 
student employees in Michigan 
Dinning (sic).”

for a building dedicated to the 
sciences.

Alexander Winchell, a regent 

and geology professor in the late 
1800s, was found to have published 
racist academic papers, maintaining 
white people are physiologically 
pre-dispositioned to be the superior 
race. 
In 
the 
document 
from 

University President Mark Schlissel 
supporting Winchell’s name to 
be removed from West Quad, 
the Committee found his novel 
“Preadamites: Or a Demonstration 
of the Existence of Men Before 
Adam” to be incredibly dangerous 
and 
utilized 
today 
by 
white 

supremacist groups.

“(Preadamites) 
was 

unambiguously racist and ‘out of 
step with the University’s own 
aspirations in those times as 
well,’” Schlissel’s response read. 
“According 
to 
the 
committee, 

portions of this book continue 
to be used today to support 
White 
supremacist 
views, 

thereby amplifying the negative 
contemporary effect of the Winchell 
naming, especially on ‘the actual 
building of communities’ that we 
should aspire to in our residential 
housing.”

Last 
Monday, 
Schlissel 

announced he agreed with the 
committee’s findings and asked the 
board to remove the names from the 
building and hall.

During his opening statements, 

Schlissel urged the board to vote 
yes on his proposals to rename the 
buildings. However, he echoed 
his sentiments from his interview 
with The Daily last Monday, saying 
further building name changes 
should not be expected anytime 

soon after these two.

“Under our review principles, 

those who wish to change formally 
designated names of spaces or 
buildings carry a heavy burden to 
justify the removal of a name and 
that this should be a rare event,” 
Schlissel said. “I believe that the 
burden has been met in these two 
instances.”

Schlissel then invited Terrence 

McDonald, 
the 
chair 
of 
the 

President’s Advisory Committee 
on University History, to present 
the 
committee’s 
findings 
and 

express 
his 
support 
for 
the 

renaming. McDonald, a history 
professor and the director of the 
Bentley Historical Library, said 
the committee operates on the 
understanding that the decision to 
name a building is a conscious one 
and removing said name does not 
eliminate the history from existing.

“We believe, first and foremost, 

that we are all wedded to the 
University’s past with all that is 
uplifting and troubling within it and 
we must understand and remember 
it but we believe equally, second, that 
historical memory and historical 
commemoration are not the same 
thing,” McDonald said. “Changing 
the name of a space does not change 
or erase our history. It revises a 
previous decision to commemorate 
something in that history.”

Prior to the vote, Public Policy 

junior 
Kevin 
Sweitzer, 
who 

submitted the proposal to rename 
Winchell House, spoke during 
public comments on agenda-related 
topics. He said this process of 
submitting the request was worth 
it to see another, more respectable 
individual be honored with the 
space in the future.

“At my time at the University, 

I have grown a lot as a person and 
when I learned that we still honor 
Alexander Winchell, who is an 

objectively wrong person in science 
and philosophy, I was astounded 
and it caused me to bring forward 
the petition,” Sweitzer said. “This 
University has taught me a lot and I 
firmly believe the right decision will 
be made today to vote to rename 
the space in West Quad and honor 
someone who is worthy of our 
support moving forward.”

LSA senior Joshua Hasler, one 

of the members of the group who 
proposed the C.C. Little building 
name change, also spoke and said 
Little’s work with eugenics supports 
causes such as the “alt-right” and 
the white supremacist Richard 
Spencer, whose ideology calls for 
a “white ethno-state.” Hasler said 
this cannot be an ideology the 
University supports.

“Little was no tepid supporter of 

American eugenics,” Hasler said. 
“He believed it was an essential 
part of human progress. It is 
especially important to rename the 
C.C. Little Science building now 
given the renewed prominence of 
xenophobic and eugenic policies 
and ideas in American political 
discourse … The University of 
Michigan must demonstrate that 
it does not celebrate the ideals of 
White supremacy and eugenics 
by commemorating the legacy of 
this movement and its campus 
geography.”

Regent 
Andrea 
Fischer 

Newman, R, echoed Schlissel’s 
and McDonald’s comments from 
earlier, reiterating the difficulty 
that should come with changing a 
building’s name but acknowledging 
the University should always work 
to right their wrongs.

“Changing 
historical 
names 

should be difficult,” Newman said. 
“Doing the right thing, though, 
shouldn’t be difficult.”

Newman 
also 
addressed 
a 

concern about University culture 

before 
voting, 
mentioning 
the 

University 
population’s 
current 

usage of C.C. Little’s name to 
identify the Central Campus Transit 
Center. She said she believed it was 
important to “change the student 
vernacular” in regard to the bus 
stop as a part of the vote.

After hearing the opinion of 

public 
comment 
speakers 
and 

Newman’s comments, the Board 
of Regents voted unanimously 
to remove the names from the 
C.C. Little Science Building and 
Winchell House.

Not even an hour after the 

vote, the sign outside the former 
C.C. Little Science Building read, 
“1100 North University Building,” 
a temporary name outlined in 
Schlissel’s proposal. There is no 
word on when or how new names 
for the building and hall will be 
selected but the conversations and 
suggestions are sure to follow in the 
coming weeks.

LEO Bargaining Efforts
Before the regents meeting 

began, 
LEO 
organizers 
and 

supporters filled the Union to 
show their support for the contract 
bargaining efforts of University 
lecturers.

LEO started conversations with 

the administration for increased 
salaries and benefits in October of 
last year. Currently, the salary for a 
full-time lecturer at the University 
is $34,500 in Ann Arbor, $28,300 
in Dearborn and $27,300 in Flint. 
The administration had initially 
responded to LEO’s demands with 
a $1,000 increase to the starting 
salary in 2019, a $750 increase 
in 2020, a $500 increase in 2021 
and a 1.5 percent annual raise for 
Ann Arbor alone. LEO lecturers, 
however, were unsatisfied with 
the numbers, and referred to the 
proposal as “insulting.”

Prior to the meeting, Philip 

A. Christman, a lecturer in the 
University’s English Department, 
explained 
the 
administration’s 

reluctance to meet the group’s 
requests was frustrating because 
they could meet LEO’s needs 
without causing much financial 
burden on the University.

“I think the word insulting is 

most appropriate,” Christman said. 
“It’s not like we haven’t given them 
a ton of information. We hired a 
guy to audit the University’s books 
to show not only that we’re getting 
a very, very small percentage of the 
revenue that we generate for the 
University but that the University 
could easily meet our demands 
without really breaking a sweat.”

Christman also addressed some 

students’ concern about an increase 
in lecturer salaries impacting the 
amount of tuition. However, LEO’s 
auditing efforts of University funds 
shows students would not have to 
pay more if their demands were 
met.

“Students will ask me, with good 

reason, ‘Can the University meet 
your demands without raising 
tuition on us?’” Christman said. “I 
personally don’t want a raise if it 
means another tuition hike, there’s 
been enough, but that’s not what is 
at stake, and we’ve shown that to 
the University.”

As LEO lecturers come near their 

contract expiration date on April 
20, they have authorized a potential 
vote for a strike if the administration 
does not adequately respond to their 
demands. Alex Elkins, LEO lecturer 
and organizer, remarked that of the 
54 percent of LEO membership who 
responded to an online survey about 
the decision to strike if needs were 
not met, 78 percent of individuals 
voted yes.

“Our membership are clearly 

engaged 
in 
the 
process 
and 

discontent with the current paces 

and progress of negotiations and 
are hoping to move forward with 
walkouts should negotiations not 
make any progress,” Elkins said.

However, while a strike is a 

possibility, Christman admitted 
he, along with other lecturers, did 
not want the situation to result in 
walkouts.

“(The 
administration’s) 
last 

counteroffer on salary was just 
insulting,” Christman said. “I think 
the most important development is 
that, and it’s a development none of 
us are too happy about, but we have 
been authorized by our membership 
to call a strike if the University 
doesn’t move significantly. We don’t 
want to do that but the way is pretty 
clear for us to do that if we have to.”

During the public comments 

portion of the meeting, LEO 
lecturers and supporters had an 
opportunity to express their wishes 
for increased wages to the board. 
After Víctor Rodríguez-Pereira, a 
lecturer in the Romance Languages 
and 
Literatures 
Department, 

outlined his three jobs as a full-
time lecturer, barista and tutor, he 
expressed his frustration with his 
current salary from the University.

“When someone greets me with 

an enthusiastic ‘Go Blue’ I can 
relate, I do go blue,” Rodríguez-
Pereira said. “I go blue when I 
look at my paystubs, and I go blue 
when I think about my first two 
years here when I had to eat all of 
my meals on the floor because I 
couldn’t even afford a couch. I go 
blue when I think of last summer, 
when I lived under the impending 
fear of eviction because I couldn’t 
keep up with my rent, and before 
anyone forgets, again, I work three 
jobs.”

couple felt frustrated by the limited 
treatment options available for their 
daughter, further inspiring them to 
aid the fight against cancer.

Their gift will focus on cultivating 

elite scientists and elevating the 
University’s science and medical 
platform in six areas: cancer research 
and technology, collaboration in the 
cancer field, cutting-edge scientists, 
scientific freedom, new researchers 
and scholarship support.

“I call Michigan ‘Collaboration 

U’ because so many different units 
work together to solve problems,” 
Rogel said in a statement in the 
release. “We have the advantage of 
97 graduate departments rated in 
the top 10 in the country. Putting 
all this brain power and excitement 
together is going to help us find a 
cure for cancer. It will make people’s 
lives better, and that’s the most 
important thing.”

Members of the Comprehensive 

Cancer Center span 53 departments 
and nine colleges of the University. 

The center was ranked 12th in 
the nation by US News and World 
Report and is consistently in the 
top 10 in research funding from the 
National Cancer Institute, according 
to the press release.

“The University of Michigan 

takes 
great 
pride 
in 
our 

commitment 
to 
research 
and 

education 
focused 
on 
solving 

humanity’s greatest challenges,” 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel said in the press release. 
“I deeply appreciate Richard and 
Susan Rogel’s unwavering devotion 
to this commitment. There has 
never been greater potential for 
fundamental discovery to lead 
to 
dramatic 
improvements 
in 

the treatment of cancer. Their 
wonderful gift will further elevate 
the life-changing impact of our 
cancer center while advancing the 
amazing work of our faculty and 
students and inspiring new hope 
for millions of patients around the 
globe.”

of white students. Though the 
proportion of students from 
underrepresented backgrounds 
has reportedly lagged in these 
programs, there has been a 
noted 15 percent increase in 
students 
of 
color 
studying 

abroad, with the University 
ranking sixth in the largest 
population of students who 
study abroad.

Many 
of 
the 
panelists 

expressed 
how 
much 
they 

cherished 
their 
experiences 

abroad, while still speaking 
frankly about the challenges 
they faced. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Amira 

Mandwee said studying abroad 
was an opportunity for her to 
discover the world and learn 
about new cultures. Growing 
up, her family didn’t possess 
the means for travel, so she 
jumped at the opportunity to 
travel through the University 
and 
satisfy 
her 
childhood 

yearning to explore. 

“I’ve wanted to study abroad 

since I was young since family 
vacations weren’t a thing,” 
Mandwee said. “I grew up first-
generation and being around 
many other first-generations, 
so I wanted to amplify those 
experiences.”

Marcus Hall, a graduate 

student in the Ford School of 
Public Policy and the School 

of 
Information, 
echoed 

Mandwee’s sentiments, saying 
while 
he 
didn’t 
have 
the 

financial resources to travel, 
he 
was 
constantly 
around 

different cultures, which only 
drove his desire to go abroad.

“Coming 
from 
a 
lower-

income background and first-
generation, I never thought 
that going abroad was feasible, 
but because I was always 
surrounded by people who 
came from many international 
backgrounds, I always found 
myself in international spaces,” 
Hall said.

Though 
many 
of 
the 

panelists conveyed their initial 
excitement of studying abroad, 
and 
how 
their 
experience 

overall was incredibly positive 
and 
life-changing, 
Business 

senior Akshay Chhajed revealed 
how specific racist instances 
made him feel uncomfortable 
while he was volunteering with 
refugees in Greece.

“People 
would 
stare 

dumbfounded, that I could 
speak Greek (as someone of 
South Asian descent),” Chhajed 
said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Brandon 

Bond 
also 
shared 
similar 

experiences 
of 
receiving 

odd looks abroad but said 
the culture he visited was 
welcoming and interested in 
his culture as well.

“In Barcelona, being Black 

was more noticeable,” Bond 
said. “I got weird stares. But in 
Mexico, people were intrigued 

by students of color, and were 
interested in who we were.”

According to LSA sophomore 

Nyla Hart, the panelists’ stories 
resonated with her and served 
to both ease anxiety about her 
upcoming study abroad trip 
and brought her attention to 
issues she may encounter.

“As a person of color going 

to study abroad, this was very 
relevant and I wanted to hear 
their experiences and know 
what to prepare for,” Hart said. 
“Peru has people of color, but 
it’s a very conservative country. 
I am worried about having 
to articulate that I am Black 
and American, but it will be a 
teaching moment.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Jamaica 

Jordan said the panel eased 
some of her worries about 
racism abroad.

“I was worried after hearing 

their experiences with racism, 
but after they talked about 
their experiences some more, 
I was back to feeling fine,” 
Jordan said. 

The talk ended with words 

of encouragement for audience 
members to find their own 
study 
abroad 
programs 

and 
experiences. 
Students 

like 
Social 
Work 
student 

Lauren emphasized that even 
though it may be difficult 
in the beginning, it will be 
worthwhile at the end.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

The change comes following 

a 
two-month 
self-imposed 

ban on social activities by the 
Interfraternity Council after reports 
of hazing, drug and alcohol abuse, 
as well as allegations of sexual 
misconduct. The Zeta Beta Tau 
fraternity’s national organization 
also revoked its chapter at the 
University for violating multiple 
policies 
and 
endangering 
its 

members. We believe this policy 
change is a step in the right direction 
toward creating a Greek life system 
that exists to improve the university 
experience of students, especially 
freshmen, instead of detracting 
from it.

The decision by the University 

will be most beneficial to the 
new freshmen class and allow its 
members more opportunities to 
become better acclimated to their 
campus community. Being a new 
freshman can be daunting, and the 
question of whether or not to join 
social Greek life in the first semester 
adds to the pressure. When 
freshmen arrive at college, their 
first friends are often those who 
live in the same residence halls as 
them. As the semester continues, 
students 
find 
themselves 

branching out and making new 
friends through their classes and 
student organizations. This allows 
freshmen to try various activities 
and find what they like best.

Fraternities and sororities often 

sell the experience to freshmen 
by promising an immediate new 
group of friends and a great social 
life. Greek life, however, is an aspect 

of campus life that requires a large 
time commitment and could cause 
new students to insulate themselves 
within their fraternity or sorority. 
With this change, students will 
have more time and energy to put 
towards the equally important 
academic transition from high 
school to college. This will also allow 
freshmen more time to find out how 
they want to spend their time on 
campus without first requiring them 
to commit to a time-consuming rush 
and pledge process.

Additionally, the new winter 

rush process helps new students 
become acclimated to the drinking 
culture on campus. As most students 
are aware, the social atmosphere 
in college is usually vastly different 
from high school. The expectations, 
the amount of alcohol and other 
drugs available and the number of 
people with whom students can 
engage in these activities drastically 
increases during Welcome Week. 
Nowhere is this more pronounced 
than in fraternities, who host the 
majority of Welcome Week events 
and provide alcohol for thousands of 
students every weekend.

There are obvious dangers 

associated with this newfound 
easy access to alcohol and other 
substances, as evidenced by more 
than 30 hospital transports during 
the weekend of the Michigan 
State game and seven during 
Halloween weekend. With winter 
rush, students will still go out and 
experience college life, but will be 
able to make better decisions about 
the drinking culture that comes 

with it, as they would have had time 
to acclimate in the fall.

There 
are, 
however, 
some 

concerns about the new policy. 
Suspending fall rush for fraternities 
may also simply lead to an informal 
rushing process that may exclude 
some 
freshmen 
who 
do 
not 

have the right connections. This 
“underground rush” would also 
be completely unregulated by the 
University, though one could possibly 
argue that currently the University 
has very little oversight regardless.

Lastly, 
this 
decision 
also 

could unfairly affect multicultural 
fraternities who provide a unique 
space for the members of their 
respective 
communities. 
When 

minority students arrive at the 
University’s predominantly white 
campus, multicultural Greek life 
can offer a support system that 
the transition to winter rush could 
threaten to delay.

Overall, however, the change 

to a winter rush process is a strong 
step by the University to improve the 
first-year experience and limit the 
insularity of Greek life on campus. 
Freshmen will have an opportunity 
to explore their interests and make 
better-informed decisions about their 
social life and future involvement 
in student organizations. And, in 
the face of recent controversies 
surrounding Greek life both on 
campus and nationally, lifting some 
of the pressure to join the Greek 
community freshmen often face 
could have long-lasting benefits.

FROM THE DAILY

Winter rush, a step in the right direction
T

he University of Michigan recently announced that it would 
transition to winter rush for social Greek organizations, starting in 
the 2019-2020 academic year as a part of a plan to improve the first-

year experience. The new plan requires students to have completed at least 
12 resident credit-hours and to be in good behavioral and academic standing 
before they can participate in the rush process. The change will affect about 
2,000 students annually according to an email sent by E. Royster Harper, 
vice president for Student Life on March 21st.

T

he first time someone 
tried 
to 
sell 
me 

Adderall was in my 

high school library. 
At the time, I did not 
think anything of it.

I was inspired to 

write this column 
by the new Netflix 
documentary 
film, 

“Take Your Pills,” 
which 
offers 
an 

interesting 
look 

into 
the 
use 
of 

stimulant 
drugs, 

such 
as 
Adderall 

and Ritalin, both past and 
present. 
According 
to 
a 

study 
by 
Johns 
Hopkins 

University’s 
Bloomberg 

School 
of 
Public 
Health, 

Adderall abuse is booming 
among young people ages 18 to 
25. In fact, non-prescription 
Adderall use increased by 67 
percent between 2006 and 
2011 and Adderall-associated 
emergency room visits rose 
156 percent. At the University 
of 
Michigan, 
24 
percent 

of students use stimulants 
despite 
only 
8.95 
percent 

having had a prescription.

Adderall 
and 
related 

drugs are central nervous 
system stimulants. Adderall, 
in particular, works as a 
catecholamine 
agonist, 

meaning 
that 
it 
binds 

to 
the 
brain’s 
receptors 

for 
catecholamine, 
the 

neurotransmitters dopamine 
and norepinephrine. The drug 
also inhibits the reuptake of 
dopamine and norepinephrine 
by brain cells, similar to 
certain 
antidepressants. 

Catecholamine is associated 
with pleasure and motivation, 
so by taking a stimulant, a 
person is basically pumping 
their brain with chemicals 
that 
lead 
to 
feelings 
of 

euphoria, focus and alertness. 
However, 
those 
chemicals 

can also lead to insomnia, 
anxiety, increased heart rate, 
hypertension (elevated blood 
pressure) and even psychosis.

That same study out of 

Johns Hopkins also found that 
treating 
young 
adolescents 

with Adderall was on the 
decline and that the rate of 
nonprescription use in the 
same population was neither 
increasing 
nor 
decreasing. 

This is eye-opening for the 
many of us whose exposure 
to the discourse surrounding 
stimulant drugs has centered 
around 
the 
perceived 

overmedication of children 
diagnosed 
with 
attention 

deficit hyperactivity disorder 
or attention deficit disorder.

I want to address the idea 

of the “ADHD business,” a 
concept featured prominently 
in the one hour and 27-minute 
runtime of “Take Your Pills.” 
In fact, the very title of the 
documentary 
implies 
that 

drugs 
like 
Adderall 
and 

Ritalin are being forced onto 
people. 
Yes, 
prescription 

stimulants are projected to be 
a 17.5-billion-dollar industry 
by 2020. However, this boom 

is being fueled by a trifecta 
of 
factors: 
the 
increased 

recognition of ADHD as a 

disease in foreign 
countries 
such 

as 
Saudi 
Arabia 

and China, more 
Americans getting 
diagnosed 
and 

treated for ADHD 
because 
they 

now have health 
insurance 
under 

Obamacare and a 
rewriting 
of 
the 

guidelines 
for 

diagnosing adults with ADHD. 
Prescription stimulants have 
a valid medical purpose and 
should not be demonized. 
Instead, my concerns lie with 
people, 
especially 
college 

students, 
using 
stimulants 

without a prescription.

Another 
aspect 
I 

found unsettling in “Take 
Your 
Pills” 
is 
the 
scene 

where 
Lawrence 
Diller, 
a 

pediatrician interviewed for 
the documentary, equated the 
severity of Adderall abuse to 
that of the opioid epidemic, 
calling it “right below the 
threshold of the opiates.” It is 
not so much the claim he made 
that bothers me but how he, 
at least in my interpretation, 
insinuated 
that 
Adderall 

abuse was not getting enough 
attention because of opioids.

Prescription 
stimulants 

and 
prescription 
synthetic 

opioids, such as oxycodone 
and 
fentanyl, 
have 
some 

commonalities. 
They 
are 

both classified as Schedule 
II/IIN controlled substances 
by 
federal 
regulations, 

meaning that they have a 
high potential for addiction 
and 
psychological/physical 

dependence. Both are also 
commonly sold and taken 
without 
a 
prescription. 

However, not all Schedule II 
substances are created equal. 
While Adderall and other 
stimulants 
can 
have 
life-

threatening effects, especially 
when mixed with alcohol, the 
fact of the matter remains that 
opioids are responsible for the 
vast majority of drug-related 
deaths in America. In fact, 
per the Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention, half 
of the top 10 drugs involved in 
overdose deaths in 2014 were 
prescription opioids. Adderall 
and 
other 
prescription 

stimulants did not even make 
the list. Opioids are just more 
dangerous than prescription 
stimulants and implying that 
one gets more attention over 

the other masks the potential 
merits behind that reality.

However, 
the 
strongest 

critique I would level against 
“Take Your Pills” is that the 
filmmakers make stimulants 
seem amazing. They even 
included a snippet of an 
interview with the late Keith 
Connors, 
the 
psychologist 

who 
established 
the 
first 

standards 
for 
diagnosing 

ADHD, where he recounted 
a time that he tried a Ritalin 
pill from a barrel of them 
supplied to his team by the 
manufacturer for their study. 
Connors then went on to 
say with nostalgia that his 
experience with Ritalin was 
“great.” After watching the 
documentary, I had an urge 
to get my hands on some 
Adderall despite never being 
diagnosed 
with 
ADHD. 
I 

wanted it because I wanted to 
do better.

Prescription 
stimulants 

are good for people with 
ADHD, but what about the 
rest of us? Should everyone 
be taking Adderall? Despite 
the obvious legal implications 
of a potential felony, let us 
turn to the ethical aspect of 
taking stimulants without a 
prescription. Everyone wants 
to get ahead, and the truth 
of the matter is that grades 
have the potential to make 
or break an application to 
an internship or graduate 
school. However, stimulants 
can further enhance social 
disparities 
that 
advantage 

some and hold back others. 
Not every University student 
can afford to buy pills from 
their peers and for certain 
students, the consequences 
of being caught selling or 
using a Schedule II substance 
illegally can be more severe 
than for others.

At the heart of my ethical 

concerns regarding the use 
of Adderall and Ritalin as 
performance 
enhancers 
is 

a question of privilege. In 
classes with grading curves, 
students 
using 
Adderall 

to help them score better 
on the exams are directly 
disadvantaging their fellow 
students 
not 
taking 
a 

stimulant. How? By shifting 
the curve in a way where the 
students not on stimulants 
will get a lower grade than if 
everyone had taken the class 
without enhancement.

I 
doubt 
that 
anyone 

taking 
stimulants 
without 

a 
prescription 
will 
give 

much concern to thoughts 
of privilege, after all, we 
live in a dog-eat-dog world 
where success is the only 
objective. 
Nevertheless, 

the nonprescription use of 
stimulants to improve one’s 
academic 
performance 
is 

inherently 
unethical. 
So, 

you can count me out of the 
Adderall craze.

W

e are heading toward 
six months since the 
ubiquitous 
hashtag 

#MeToo was re-popularized by 
Alyssa Milano. It’s been six months 
since the Harvey Weinstein scandal; 
six months that have been marked 
by triumph over abusers in positions 
of power such as politician John 
Conyers and news anchor Matt Lauer 
and by inspiring activism across the 
nation. The past six months have also 
included a confusing rollercoaster on 
a plethora of crucial issues such as 
immigration, healthcare, Russia, the 
Iran nuclear deal and so on. So while 
some powerful abusers have been 
justly defeated, another has reaped 
the benefits of a 24-hour news cycle 
that cannot seem to remember what 
atrocities occurred the week before.

President Donald Trump has 

been accused of sexual assault by 
21 women. His response has largely 
been to dismiss and disregard their 
allegations, once calling them all 
“horrible liars.” For those who found 
the testimony of more than a dozen 
women to be unconvincing, a video 
of Trump himself bragging about 
groping women surfaced on Oct. 7, 
2016. On Oct. 13 (less than a month 
before being elected President), he 
said “Look at her . . . I don’t think so” 
about an accuser, implying that there 
is a correlation between a woman’s 
appearance and her likelihood of 
being assaulted. And yet, the stories 
and his reprehensible responses to 
them managed to get lost in the chaos 
that has been the past 14 months.

There are many reasons to 

dislike Trump. There are many 
reasons to call for his impeachment. 

I feel that this particular aspect of 
his existence should be covered 
with the frequency and deference 
that it deserves. Our president is a 
serial sexual predator. We cannot 
claim to be the beacon of democracy 
and human rights as long as this is 
true. It is a grotesque reflection of 
a society that looks past criminal 
behavior if the criminal is a wealthy 
white heterosexual male who will 
work to maintain the hierarchical 
system that has privileged him. 
Members of Trump’s team left 
because of steel tariffs, but did not 
bat an eye at these accusations.

The allegations were also largely 

ignored at the height of #MeToo 
movement. Whether it was because 
our collective memory could not 
stand to hold any more Trump 
scandals than we already had or if 
in our hearts we knew that he was 
one predator we weren’t going to 
topple, I don’t know. I know that as I 
watched in awe at the brave women 
coming forward to speak their truth 
and be heard, there were at least 21 
women who were watching while 
their abuser sat in the Oval Office. 
While I rejoiced as large, powerful 
institutions 
finally 
held 
their 

leadership accountable, the Free 
World couldn’t do the same.

That 
image 
disturbs 
me: 

millions of survivors feeling hope 
for the first time in so long, while 
simultaneously being governed by 
an accused rapist. It also makes 
me feel a little hopeless. When 
21 women’s stories aren’t worth 
any formal investigation, when 
evangelical Republicans can back a 
candidate who said, “I just grab ‘em 

by the pussy,” when even the anti-
Trump feminists seem to forget 
that in addition to being a racist, 
sexist, homophobic bigot, he is also 
a violent criminal, the state of justice 
in this country feels quite bleak.

But recently, there has been a 

glimmer of hope on the topic. One 
of the “horrible liars” is fighting 
back against our “Predator in Chief.” 
Summer Zervos is filing a defamation 
suit against Trump for calling her 
a liar about the accusations. The 
Trump team responded by claiming 
that a sitting president cannot be 
sued. A New York Supreme Court 
Judge rejected that notion, saying, 
“No one is above the law.” In one 
of the most ironic plot twists of the 
Trump era yet, this precedent was 
set after Paula Jones sued former 
President Bill Clinton in 1998.

This could end in Trump being 

forced to speak under oath about the 
allegations as Clinton did 20 years 
ago when he famously said: “I did 
not have sexual relations with that 
woman (Monica Lewinsky).” First of 
all, poor Hillary Clinton. When will 
this nightmare end for her? Second of 
all, I sincerely hope that #MeToo has 
evoked something strong enough in 
this nation’s conscience to lead us to 
justice for Zervos and the 20 other 
women who have been brave enough 
to come forward with their stories. 
I am not quite optimistic about the 
prospects of that, but these recent 
developments have certainly made 
me less hopeless.

John Krasinski: 
On the silence, sound and 
scares in ‘A Quiet Place’

INTERVIEW

“I’m an emotional dude, so I’ll 
tell you everything.”
John Krasinski has written 
a love letter into a horror 
movie. 
A 
self-proclaimed 
scaredy-cat 
with 
eyebrows 
made of charisma, his passion 
is contagious as he talks about 
his latest film, one that is 
simultaneously 
unexpected 
and organic. In an interview 
with 
The 
Daily, 
Krasinski 
opens up about the on and off-
screen scares that came with 
his experience of co-writing, 
directing and starring in “A 
Quiet Place.”
Set in a post-apocalyptic 
world 
where 
mysterious 
creatures hunt by sound, the 
horror-thriller 
centers 
on 
the Abbott family and their 
reliance on silence for survival. 
“I don’t think that anyone 
would consider me the horror 
guy,” Krasinski admitted, and 
considering he is widely known 
as “The Office”’s small-town 
heartthrob Jim Halpert, few 
would disagree.
And yet, he found himself 
drawn to the story beneath the 
scares. Krasinski read the script 

a few weeks after he and Emily 
Blunt, his wife and co-star, had 
their second daughter.
“I was already in the state 
of terror of keeping this girl 
safe, keeping this girl alive,” 
Krasinski said, recalling the 
usual fears that come with new-
founded fatherhood. “When I 
first read the script … I saw that 
it could be a huge metaphor for 
parenthood. I was wide open for 
this one and it connected to me 
in a big way. ”
Krasinski took on the rewrite, 
drawing from his own haunts 
to lead each scene back to the 
central family dynamic. He 
deeply 
connected 
with 
his 
character, Lee, a father whose 
main priority is to keep his family 
safe, 
while 
simultaneously 
crafting a beautiful foil in Lee’s 
wife, Evelyn, a mother who 
persists to nurture her children 
despite the surrounding threats. 
An intricate relationship was 
born on screen and, secretly, 
Krasinski thought of his own 
wife for Evelyn’s role throughout 
the rewrite.
Blunt was working on “Mary 
Poppins Returns” during the 
time 
of 
Krasinski’s 
rewrite 
(“A small little indie movie,” 
Krasinski joked) but once she 
read the script, she was sold on 

the role.
“I’ve been firsthand seeing 
how she makes decisions and 
how incredibly smart she is,” 
Krasinski said. “So when she 
actually signed onto the movie it 
truly is the greatest compliment 
of my career because I’ve seen 
what it takes to get her to say yes 
to things.”
From there, Krasinski and 
Blunt drew from their personal 
relationship to keep honest 
communication on set. The duo 
was constantly talking about the 
film, the relationship that they 
were portraying on screen and 
the visual and audio elements 
that would have to be married 
into a cohesive unit in order to 
pull off the film’s vision.
“We were both really scared 
to work with each other,” he said. 
“But I’ve never collaborated 
with someone who is better. It 
was amazing.”
Krasinski, from the start, 
was all in, generating an energy 
conducive to experimentation. 
“The cool thing was, every 
single member of the crew knew 
that this movie could be special. 
From the production design 
to the cinematography I had a 
vision, but I always love input 
because I think an idea can 
always be beat.”

His work as an actor was 
especially 
important 
while 
directing and allowed to create 
an intimate space for the central 
four characters. “Instead of 
being a disembodied head that 
yells ‘cut’ and interrupts their 
flow, I actually get to be in there,” 
Krasinski said as he talked about 
working with Blunt and the two 
child stars, Millicent Simmonds 
(“Wonderstruck”) 
and 
Noah 
Jupe (“The Night Manager”).
For 
Krasinski, 
the 
performances themselves were 
never supposed to be scary. 
Drawing from his experience 
on “The Office,” he continued 
to employ creator Greg Daniel’s 
advice: Allow the audience to 
interpret a performance for 
themselves. “I never would have 
done this movie if it wasn’t for 
that advice because I looked at 
this not as a horror movie,” he 
explained. “If I can make you 
fall in love with this family then 
you’ll be scared because you 
don’t want anything to happen 
to them.”
Instead, 
fear 
manifests 
through the sound design and 
the score, which acts as an 
omnipresent narrator created 
by composer Marco Beltrami 
(“The Hurt Locker”).
“(Beltrami) 
wrote 
music 
for so much of the movie,” 
Krasinski 
said. 
“Then 
the 

question was, ‘Can we pull 
music out?’ I thought that that 
would be a difficult conversation 
to have with your composer, 
and he loved it. He was along 
for the ride of this experiment 
and could see how every day it 
changed.”
Finding silence was crucial. 
The Abbott family must figure 
out how to live in a world with 
no noise — sanding paths, 
communicating through lights, 
avoiding wooden boards — in 
order to survive the creatures. 
“Not to sound too like hippy 
dippy or out there, but the truth 
is the most fun was actually just 
shooting scenes in dead silence.”
A large component of creating 
that silence was using American 
Sign Language, the form of 
communication 
that 
gives 
the Abbott family a chance 
at survival. “There’s a lot of 
pretty languages out there, but 
nothing more beautiful than 
sign language,” he said.
For Krasinski, it was non-
negotiable 
to 
cast 
a 
deaf 
actress for the role of Regan, 
the Abbott’s deaf daughter. 
Their inspiration, teacher and 
guide came in actress Millicent 
Simmonds and, at the risk of 
sounding 
corny, 
Krasinski 
gushed on the delicate nature 
with 
which 
Simmonds 
approached teaching ASL.

“I’ve never had someone 
take in all of me when we were 
communicating,” he explained. 
“She said, ‘I think it’s really 
interesting that each of the 
characters is coming out in your 
sign. The father is a guy who 
doesn’t care about anything in 
the world but keeping people 
safe, so all of his signs are very 
curt and short. And Emily is 
trying to give these kids a much 
bigger life. So hers are much 
more poetic and gesture-y.’”
And in silence, “A Quiet 
Place” was able to transcend 
beyond the usual horror film. 
“You can overwrite dialogue, 
you can overwrite backstory … 
and in doing so you rob the two 
characters of having an intimate 
moment,” Krasinski said. “I got 
the rare opportunity to have a 
slow dance with my wife in this 
movie. So much is being said in 
that one dance.”
“You’re catching me in a 
moment where I’ve never been 
more overwhelmed by a response 
to a movie,” Krasinski said, that 
emotional dude spilling out a bit 
more than before. “There’s just 
that moment where you have to 
step to the edge and jump or not. 
I’m really glad I took the I took 
the leap.”

“A Quiet Place” comes to 
theaters Apr. 6, 2018.

An evening with Lorde

In the never-ending whirlwind 
of bar and club shows, it’s easy 
to forget the magic that occurs 
alongside the detail and attention 
given 
to 
full-scale 
concert 
productions. Lorde’s show on 
Wednesday night at Detroit’s 
Little Caesars Arena was truly 
nothing short of pure magic.
Before her set, Lorde received 
some fantastic support from the 
inimitable queen of indie rock, 
Mitski, and explosive hip-hop duo 
Run The Jewels. With an early set 
time, Mitski unfortunately played 
to a half-empty arena while seats 
slowly filled, but was nonetheless 
spectacular, with a set that 
included the anthemic “Your Best 
American Girl” and closed with 
the scathing “Drunk Walk Home.” 
Run The Jewels played most of 
their hits like, “Call Ticketron” 
and “Stay Gold,” upping the 
rhythm and energy of the crowd 
in preparation for our Lorde and 
savior to take the stage.
Within a matter of seconds 
into her opening song “Sober,” 
the entire arena was transformed 
into Lorde’s own dreamscape, 
a 
transmutable 
playground 
for her to share her deepest 

secrets and darkest emotions. 
Background dancers flooded the 
stage when necessary to set the 
scene — an intimate party during 
“Homemade Dynamite” and a 
sensual dance between lovers 
during “The Louvre.” All at once, 
Lorde left everything and nothing 
to the imagination with settings 
as personally subjective as needed 
but altogether objective in their 
presentation.
Lorde 
herself 
transformed 
throughout 
the 
performance, 
starting the show with a sleek black 
outfit, changing midway through 
the show on stage into a flowing 
pink gown that she then later 
exchanged for flared red bottoms 
with a matching ruffled top. 
Lorde took the crowd through the 
emotions of her music with these 
expertly timed changes, reflecting 
the deftly planned setlist. Melding 
cuts from Melodrama and Pure 
Heroine together, Lorde presented 
a young and intense love broken 
down to the sweet innocence of 
intimacy, eventually bringing us 
to a spiteful but reflective post-
breakup independence.
This is the artist of a generation 
at her most affecting, most genuine 
and truly most breathtaking. 
Her show was both a visual 
and auditory spectacle, blended 
perfectly into a story deeply and 

universally resonant. Prefacing 
“Ribs” off of Pure Heroine with 
“This is a song I wrote when I 
was 16,” she reminded the crowd 
of her former outlook as a teen, 
tracing the messy path to young 
adulthood with an incredibly 
perceptive eye. She took the time 
to thank the crowd for being 
with her, reflecting on the fact 
that she was once writing her 
songs alone in a bedroom without 
ever imagining she’d be sharing 
them with arenas full of people. 
Lorde also interposed a gorgeous 
cover of Frank Ocean’s “Solo” 
between “Writer in the Dark” and 
“Liability,” reflecting on her own 
efficacy in the messy melodrama 
of life through these three tracks. 
“Supercut” had the entire crowd 
screaming along, reminiscing on 
the purest, happiest moments of 
life scattered throughout the dark.
If Lorde’s performance showed 
us anything, it’s that we truly do 
not deserve an artist with such 
overwhelming talent. Without the 
words to do her justice, I’ll leave 
you with this: Few artists are able 
to so magnificently capture acute 
emotion the way Lorde has with 
her music, and her performance 
follows suit in a way that is so 
immersive 
and 
tangible 
it’s 
almost impossible not to feel the 
melodrama.

CONCERT REVIEW

Mohja Kahf creates unity 
through masterful poetry

Last Friday, poet Mohja Kahf 
performed readings from her latest 
poetry collection, “Hagar Poems,” 
at the Rackham Amphitheatre.
“Performed” should not be 
taken lightly. Out of the myriad 
of poetry readings I’ve attended 
since the age of 15, Kahf’s was by 
far the liveliest. Kahf’s reading 
was theatrical and inviting, while 
politically informed and incredibly 
moving. She didn’t stand behind 
the podium, but rather in the 
center of the stage, moving freely 
and expressively as she read.
To me, this came as a bit of 
a surprise. Kahf was born in 
Damascus, Syria, in 1967, but grew 
up in the American Midwest. 
Her 
poetry 
encapsulates 
her 
experience as a Syrian woman 
living in America — all the 
similarities 
and 
differences 
between her native and adopted 
countries.
It’s clear that Kahf’s poems 
carry 
an 
American 
poetic 
influence, evident through their 
use of free verse and informality of 
language. However, Kahf’s work 
is also heavily informed by Arabic 
poetry, reflective of Qur’anic suras 
and the prominence of the Arabic 
oral tradition.
Kahf’s poetry both addresses 
and reinvents stereotypes about 
Muslim women, encapsulating 
issues of femininity, sexuality and 

gender. Her poems ruminate on 
Islamic traditions — which non-
Muslims often view with an air of 
ignorance and misunderstanding 
— in a way that is emotional, 
personal and, frankly, hilarious.
Kahf addresses the satisfaction 

of 
self-mastery 
that 
occurs 
during Ramadan, despite the 
almost torturous struggle that 
occurs when beginning to fast, 

the experience of being a mother 
in moments of frustration and 
the misunderstanding, trial and 
devastation that exist in the 
current state of Syria.
In the context of the American 
political moment as well as the 
Syrian 
crisis, 
addressing 
the 
overlapping themes within Kahf’s 
poetry is incredibly important. 
Kahf’s work, however, is infused 
with emotion — pride, sadness, 
anger 
— 
complicating 
these 
themes that are often viewed 
as one-sided. Kahf reveals the 
multilayered and complex issues 
of what it means to be a Syrian 
woman and an American citizen 
today, while allowing room for 
happiness and humor as well.
Kahf invited the audience 
to participate heavily, reciting 
moving call-and-answer poems, 
engaging in conversation and 
asking questions as to what the 
audience wanted to hear from her. 
The audience’s reaction iterated 
the wave of emotions felt as 
Kahf read — passion, sorrow and 
happiness.
Through 
her 
bubbly 
and 
inviting 
personality, 
theatrical 
and potent poetic voice and 
genuine and kind engagement 
with her audience, Kahf created a 
humanizing conversation around 
the current state of Syria that, 
many times, is not talked about. 
Kahf’s reading created a powerful 
unity that spread over the entire 
room — a kind of unity that, today, 
we need more of.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Friday, March 30, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

Few artists have electrified 

Ann Arbor audiences like Chick 
Corea. His 2015 performance 
with Herbie Hancock was one 
of the most recent University 
Musical Society performances 
of the past couple of years. His 
historic performance at Hill 
Auditorium during the Great 
Blizzard of 1978 (again with 
Herbie Hancock) was released 
as part one of “An Evening with 
Herbie Hancock & Chick Corea: 
In Concert.”

This 
coming 
weekend, 

Corea partners with the Jazz 
at Lincoln Center Orchestra to 
present an evening of Corea’s 
music 
at 
Hill 
Auditorium. 

The concert will also feature 
the Jazz at Lincoln Center 
Orchestra, another ensemble 
that has proven to be extremely 
popular 
among 
Ann 
Arbor 

audiences.

This 
concert 
also 
marks 

the end of the Jazz at Lincoln 
Center’s 
first 
tour 
without 

Wynton 
Marsalis, 
the 

accomplished 
leader 
of 
the 

ensemble 
who 
is 
currently 

taking a brief hiatus to pursue 
other projects.

“This was a good first foray 

into touring without Wynton,” 
said Jason Olaine, Director of 
Programming and Touring for 
Jazz at Lincoln Center, in an 
interview with The Daily. As 
they enter their last couple days 
of performances, “the band and 
Chick have been really happy.”

Jazz at Lincoln Center is a 

notoriously busy organization. 
I interviewed Olaine as he 
arrived back to New York from 
Shanghai, and as the ensemble 
moved from Arizona to Chicago. 
With 
this 
hectic 
schedule, 

it’s easy to understand why 
Marsalis might have stepped 
away from the ensemble for a 
little while.

“Usually our Jazz at Lincoln 

Center Orchestra with Wynton 
Marsalis tours between 13 and 
18 weeks every year,” Olaine 
said. 
“Wynton 
scheduled 
a 

short sabbatical and our agent 
happens to be Chick’s agent.”

While the Jazz at Lincoln 

Center Orchestra and Chick 
Corea go on tour all the time, 
Ann Arbor is lucky to have 
hosted 18 previous Jazz at 
Lincoln 
Center 
Orchestra 

concerts 
and 
five 
previous 

Chick Corea concerts.

“This concert does speak to 

your in-house-programming to 
have been able to secure this 
date,” Olaine said.

Corea is perhaps best known 

today for his versatility. He 
has performed throughout his 
career with a huge number 
of artists, collaborating with 
everyone from Miles Davis 
to Bobby McFerrin. He has 
worked frequently in the past 
with the Jazz at Lincoln Center 
Orchestra and is quite popular 
among the members of the 
ensemble.

Last time he worked with the 

orchestra, “Chick had a great 
time and we loved it,” Olaine 
said. “Victor Goines has been 
working with Chick as co-music 
director,” he continued, and 
there has been “lots of great 
energy all around.”

Corea 
and 
the 
ensemble 

have gone on to develop a close 
relationship, performing not as 
soloist and orchestra but as a 
coherent ensemble.

“It’s a little bit different 

than coming up with a new 
setlist every night,” Olaine said. 
“Chick is such a grandmaster, 
and it’s been to be pretty special 
(to work with him).”

In the past, the ensemble 

has collaborated with Corea to 
perform newer compositions. 
They 
also 
worked 
quite 

extensively on the music of 
Thelonious 
Monk. 
During 

this 
tour, 
however, 
they’re 

“primarily focusing on (Corea’s) 
music,” Olaine explained.

Saturday’s 
performance 

marks the end of the tour that 
started in Provo, Utah on Mar. 
20. Given what he has heard 
of the first portion of the tour, 
Olaine seemed confident that 
it will be a magical event. The 
Final Four basketball game on 
the same night recently pushed 
the concert back a half hour, and 
he predicted that this would 
only add to the energy of the 
performance.

“The concert in Michigan 

on Saturday is gonna be a great 
one,” Olaine said. In their 
previous collaborations, “Chick 
has had a great time and we 
absolutely loved it.”

As for future performances of 

both the Jazz at Lincoln Center 
Orchestra and Chick Corea in 
Ann Arbor, Olaine was hesitant 
to make any promises. “When 
it works out next, we’ll see,” he 
said.

As for the end of the tour, 

however, he predicted a great 
performance. 
Saturday’s 

performance will mark the 
end of a fantastic tour and 
(hopefully) the beginning of 
a new collaboration between 
artist and ensemble.

“Chick has been having a 

great time, and our guys love 
Chick,” Olaine said. All in all, it 
promises to be another exciting 
evening for these two ensembles 
in a city that has played host to 
some remarkable concerts from 
them over the past 40 years.

A 
breakthrough 
for 
the 

University’s 
business 
and 

fashion scenes, The Michigan 
Fashion Media Summit (MFMS) 
will be hosting their first annual 
conference on Apr. 13, 2018. The 
student-run, 40-person team is 
sprinting to the finish, prepping 
for the event’s debut, one that 
will transform the Ross School 
of Business into an impactful 
fashion mecca. High fashion 
does not even begin to describe 
it. Wolverines, you do not want 
to miss this one.

The 
day-long 
conference 

entails 
a 
never-before-seen 

grouping of speakers from the 
fashion 
industry. 
Attendees 

of the event — hosted by Amy 
Levin, founder and executive 
director of the global fashion 
community College Fashionista 
— can look forward to talks 
from fashion industry geniuses, 
including Gary Sheinbaum, CEO 
of Tommy Hilfiger Americas, 
and David Cho, Director of 
Partnership 
Activation 
for 

Adidas.

Anxiously 
awaiting 
the 

arrival 
of 
the 
event, 
the 

confident, savvy and, of course, 
highly fashionable founders of 
MFMS spoke of their inspiration 
for the creation of an event of 
this caliber.

“What was really important 

to me is teaching incoming 
Wolverines, and also current 
students, about the importance 
of networking, and just how 
rewarding it is to form an 
event that touches every part 
of business through a fashion 
channel. That’s really why we’re 

filling a void, we are putting a 
different spin on what fashion 
organizations currently exist on 
campus,” said MFMS President, 
Founder and LSA senior Ali 
Gropper.

The void that MFMS is 

filling has caught the attention 
of industry titans, such as 

Rachel Zoe, who has expressed 
immense 
support 
of 
the 

organization’s 
work. 
Truly 

unique to Michigan’s campus, 
MFMS aims to reach students in 
all corners of the University.

“Every person who cares 

about what they wear, who 
has an interest in brands, who 
knows what’s cool, who knows 
what’s trending, who is on 
Instagram and scrolls … we 
touch every single inch of any 

industry through this channel 
of fashion but really it extends 
so much further than that,” 
said Kinesiology senior Rachel 
Roth, who is also the co-founder, 
creative 
director 
and 
chief 

marketing officer of MFMS.

With 
an 
emphasis 
on 

networking 
and 
the 
inner 

workings 
of 
the 
fashion 

industry, MFMS is merging the 
best of both worlds to present a 
conference that is multi-faceted, 
fabulous and, above all, high-
fashion.

Drawing 
inspiration 
from 

the Michigan Sports Business 
Conference, MFMS brings a 
creative twist to the traditional 
business 
atmosphere 
often 

portrayed in the Ross School of 
Business. 

“It’s a different vibe in the 

two different businesses … you 
go into a sports office, it doesn’t 
matter what organization you’re 
working with, everyone’s in 
a suit and tie and it’s kind of 
that culture. You walk into a 
big fashion company, there’s 
no dress code. People wear 
whatever they want. It’s a little 
more relaxed. It’s more creative. 
It’s more fun,” said LSA senior 
and MFMS co-founder and chief 
operating officer Ryan Walker.

As Apr. 13 rapidly approaches, 

MFMS is certainly an event you 
want to keep an eye on. Aiming 
to reach students of all career 
trajectories, the opportunities 
for involvement in both the 
business and fashion worlds are 
endless.

Michigan Fashion Media 
Summit a breakthrough

MARGARET SHERIDAN

Daily Arts Writer

When my 11th grade A.P. 

American Literature class began 
reading 
“Beloved,” 
by 
Toni 

Morrison, I couldn’t have been 
more 
excited; 
it 
represented 

the blend of American history 
and contemporary voices that I 
loved, and I had yet to read any of 
Morrison’s works. I don’t want to 
ruin the plot for anyone who has 
yet to read it, so let it suffice to 
say that the novel tells the story 
of Sethe, an enslaved woman 
who runs away with her children 
from a plantation and, upon facing 
capture and re-enslavement, is 
presented with an impossible 
choice. It’s one she makes and 
sticks to.

I immediately fell in love with 

Morrison’s writing. I had never 
read a book so simultaneously 
blunt and musical, sparse yet 
evocative. Yet my experience with 
the book, beyond my appreciation 
for Morrison’s talent, was shaped 
primarily by my shock at how 
Sethe’s action quickly became 
the most polarized topic among 
my grade class. I had never seen 
my classmates so animated over 
debating a person’s decision in 
a piece of literature, from any 
course. Either the mother’s choice 
was unequivocally wrong or it was 
justified, something that we could 
see ourselves making.

I argued at the time that we 

couldn’t know if we would have 

done the same thing; part of the 
brilliance of “Beloved” is how 
Morrison keeps us at a distance 
from her characters, a distance 
I couldn’t help but feel was 
deepened by the fact that the 
majority of my class, faculty and 
school was white; my peers and 
I had grown up learning about 
American slavery in neat, annual 
units. Though I had incredible 
history teachers in high school, I 
felt that my classmates and I had 
never been taught how to fully 
grasp the weight of that piece of 
our history.

Since then, “Beloved” has been 

my answer whenever people ask 
what my favorite book is. My reply 
to the follow-up question has 
been, from 11th grade until just 
this year, because it’s “the most 
visceral lesson in empathy a book 
has ever given me.” I’ve spent the 
past year reading and writing and 
talking about “Beloved” for my 
English thesis, and have decided 
it is more true to say that reading 
the book is a lesson in the limits of 
empathy. Based on the true story 
of Margaret Garner, no other book 
I have ever read has reckoned so 
viscerally with the limits of white 
access to and empathy for Black 
narratives, access to incomplete 
records of American slavery’s 
history, the troubled articulation 
of 
unspeakable 
trauma 
and 

the strive to recuperate stories 
that have been lost to history. 
Through language stripped down 
to only the most vital elements, 
moments of uninhibited love, of 

private intimacy, are rendered 
in 
heartbreakingly 
exquisite 

prose. The epilogue of “Beloved” 
may be the most beautiful and 
haunting piece of writing I’ve ever 
encountered.

“Beloved” is part of why I chose 

to major in English and history, 
and part of why I’m so invested 
in 
interdisciplinary 
work. 
In 

“The Site of Memory,” Morrison 
noted that in writing “Beloved,” 
her job had become figuring 
out “how to rip that veil drawn 
over ‘proceedings too terrible 
to relate.’” I think that learning 
how to reckon with this veil that 
reminds us of experiences or parts 
of our history we may never fully 
understand is of vital importance 
for us as creators and consumers 
of art, as students and teachers, 
as active participants of a world 
in which these issues are only 
escalating in urgency.

The 
first 
time 
I 
finished 

“Beloved,” I scribbled on the back 
page: “Reading this book feels 
like listening to a stethoscope 
pressed up against the heart of the 
nation.” A pretentious thing to say, 
perhaps, but it feels truer to me 
more so now than ever. My copy is 
heavy with fading penciled notes 
from high school, careful red 
underlining from this summer and 
eager highlighting from the past 
few weeks as I’ve tried for months 
to articulate what I feel to be true: 
For its lessons, for its warnings 
and its beauty, “Beloved” is one of 
the most important books of the 
past half century.

Notebook: Porikos “fine” after big hit Sunday, Martin coming into his own

Twelve 
minutes 
into 
the 

NCAA Northeast Regional Final 
on Sunday, Boston University 
forward Nikolas Olsson lowered 
his left shoulder and knocked 
Michigan forward Niko Porikos 
into the side-boards.

The senior’s head slammed 

against the glass and he fell 
to the ice, where he spent the 
next 30 seconds kneeling before 
getting up and making his way 
towards the Wolverine bench 
under his own power. Porikos 
was on the bench for the rest 
of the first period, and did not 
return with the team after 
intermission.

Porikos wanted to sit on the 

bench for the rest of the game, 
but after communicating with 
trainer Rick Bancroft, Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson decided 
it would be better for him to 
remain in the locker room.

“Anytime you have a hit to the 

head like that you pretty much 
pull him right out of the game,” 
Pearson said. “There’s no wiggle 
room there.”

While 
the 
immediate 

aftermath of the hit hinted 
at a scary situation, Porikos’ 
absence from the bench was 
mostly precautionary. Following 
further testing throughout the 
night and the next day, Porikos 
was cleared to return to practice 
earlier this week and took part in 
full-contact practice Thursday 
afternoon, after which Pearson 
called him “fine.”

“That’s concussion protocol 

now, even if you don’t maybe 
have symptoms or don’t feel 
that bad any time you get hit 
to the head,” Pearson said. “I 
totally agree with it. ... There’s a 
number of things, depending on 
how they think the hit was, and 
just more importantly, how the 
student-athlete reacts and what 
his symptoms are.”

In 21 games this season, 

Porikos has scored one goal 
and accrued five assists. After 
alternating between a healthy 
scratch and the active lineup 
during the Wolverines’ first 
26 games, he has carved out 

a regular role, appearing in 
nine of the last 13 games and 
registering three helpers during 
that span.

Reading between the lines
Porikos’ 
early 
exit 
isn’t 

expected to impact his place 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ 
lineup, 

however. Against Northeastern 
last Saturday and against the 
Terriers, he joined sophomore 
Adam Winborg and freshman 
Dakota Raabe on Michigan’s 
listed fourth line, a trio that 
Pearson 
believes 
will 
play 

together next Thursday against 
Notre Dame.

“It should be (the same),” 

Pearson said Thursday. “We’re 
always reevaluating our lineup. 
We had a good series out there, 
but there’s other guys that look 
good in practice. There’s been 
really good competition so far.”

As opposed to the mix-and-

match mentality of October, 
November 
and 
December, 

Pearson has sought stability 
with 
his 
lines 
during 
the 

season’s second half, especially 

with all four lines being able to 
contribute offensively. Against 
Boston, for example, the third 
line 
of 
freshmen 
Michael 

Pastujov and Jack Becker and 
sophomore 
Nick 
Pastujov 

combined for three assists, one 
goal — Nick’s empty-netter that 
sealed the victory — and a plus-
4 rating.

“They’ve got enough guys 

who can put the 
puck in the net 
when given the 
opportunity,” 
Pearson said of 
his bottom lines. 
“They’re playing 
well together as 
groups, which is 
important. And 
they’re fulfilling 
a role on our 
team 
that 
we 

need, and that’s 
providing some energy and 
hustle.”

Down the stretch in particular, 

Pearson has constantly stated 
that the ultimate focus is on 

his own team, rather than 
being overly concerned with 
opponents’ strategy. As such, 
while the third and fourth lines 
are often employed as checking 
lines in order to stop opposing 
playmakers, that isn’t the case 
for the Wolverines this year.

This is amplified by the fact 

that the Fighting Irish are 
the 
higher-seeded 
team, 
so 

Michigan 
no 

longer 
is 
the 

designated home 
team like it was 
in both games 
last 
weekend. 

The 
driving 

force 
behind 

the Wolverines’ 
win 
over 

Northeastern 
on Saturday was 
seniors 
Tony 

Calderone 
and 

Dexter Dancs and junior Cooper 
Marody 
— 
who 
persuaded 

Pearson to let them go up 
against Adam Gaudette, Dylan 
Sikura 
and 
Nolan 
Stevens 

— 
outdueling 
the 
Huskies’ 

explosive front line. Without 
last change against Notre Dame, 
though, specific matchups will 
play less of a role.

“Sometimes you’re not as 

concerned 
with 
matchups,” 

Pearson said. “Even more so 
now that we’re the visiting team 
… We’re just going to roll some 
guys out there and make Notre 
Dame worry about who we’re 
putting on the ice.”

And with the development of 

the Pastujovs, Becker and others 
as sources of offense, Pearson 
believes he has the personnel to 
make that possible.

Martin slims down to bulk 

up Michigan’s defense

The past month has not been 

kind to Luke Martin.

Against Arizona State on Feb. 

23, 
Martin’s 
defensive-zone 

turnover led to a Sun Devil goal 
within the first minute. This 
mistake seemed to set the tone 
for the sophomore defenseman’s 
recent rough patch, in which he 
recorded a minus-three rating 

over five games.

But the Martin that led the 

Wolverines with a plus-17 rating 
throughout the first 32 games 
returned 
for 
the 
Northeast 

Regional, commanding the back 
line with strength and authority. 
Martin was a plus-three for the 
weekend’s two games, even 
adding an assist on Saturday.

Martin’s 
known 
for 
his 

physicality and size — he’s listed 
at 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds — but 
it was this size that hindered 
him in part during his earlier 
slump. A leaner Martin took the 
ice last weekend, and he was 
able to rediscover his prior form 
as a result.

According 
to 
Pearson, 

Martin’s 
slimmer 
figure 

brought a boost of confidence as 
well, which has led to a stronger 
overall game.

“He’s dropped his weight 

a little bit, which allows him 
to be quicker,” Pearson said. 
“He’s a big guy, and he’s a 
pretty good skater for his size, 
but I think he’s found a weight 
that’s really helped him. ... I 
thought he played tremendous 
this weekend. I thought he was 
outstanding, and part of that is 
getting his confidence back.”

Martin, like junior Joseph 

Cecconi and sophomore Griffin 
Luce, is usually seen as a 
“stay-at-home,” 
defense-first 

blueliner, at least in relation 
to senior Sam Piazza, junior 
Nicholas Boka or freshman 
Quinn Hughes, who are willing 
and capable of pushing the 
puck hard up the ice. This has 
allowed Michigan to optimize 
its defensive pairings so that 
they 
will 
complement 
each 

other’s skill sets.

Martin and Piazza have spent 

the majority of the last two 
months playing with each other, 
and on Thursday, Pearson raved 
about the rapport the two have 
developed during that time.

“Him and Sam have done a 

real nice job playing off of each 
other,” Pearson said. “And I 
think that’s the other thing. We 
were changing pairs, and now 
he knows who his partner is, 
and you can see a real chemistry 
between them.”

Senior forward Niko Porikos left Michigan’s game against Boston University in the NCAA Northeast Regional Final after a big hit.

“I thought 
he played 

tremendous 

this weekend.”

Michigan hoping to stay 
grounded against Purdue

One 
wouldn’t 
normally 

associate 
football 
with 

softball, but coaches from 
both sports preach adherence 
to the “ground game” as a 
necessity to win.

On the gridiron that might 

mean handing the ball off to a 
running back and advancing 
the ball inch by inch rather 
than picking up a large chunk 
of yardage through the air.

In the same vein, the No. 

17 Michigan softball team 
has seen first hand the value 
of ground balls over the past 
few games, and should look to 
use it against Purdue in this 
weekend’s upcoming series. 
Against Iowa, the Wolverines 
saw their 18-game winning 
streak 
fall 
in 
large 
part 

because Michigan swung its 
bats towards the sky rather 
than the field. Even though 
the 
Wolverines 
mounted 

a furious comeback in the 
seventh inning, that ended 
when sophomore outfielder 
Haley Hoogenraad hit a fly 
ball to left field to end the 
game.

Against 
Detroit 
Mercy, 

Michigan 
quite 
literally 

stayed 
grounded. 
Junior 

catcher Katie Alexander sent 
a 
hit 
rolling 

through 
the 

diamond 
that 

was 
bobbled 

by 
a 
Titans 

fielder, 
and 

just like that 
the 
score 

was 
1-0 
in 

the 
second 

inning. Junior 
outfielder 
Natalie 
Peters singled 
through the left side and 
the 
scoreboard 
read 
3-0, 

Wolverines.

Three more ground balls 

later, 
and 
Michigan 
got 

the luxury of a two-inning 
vacation and a 15-0 win in its 
back pocket.

“The biggest thing that we 

worked on in practice was just 
trying to make adjustments 
early,” said freshman first 
baseman Lou Allan. “I think 
that after the first inning, we 
all came together and kinda 
had a game plan of getting 
behind the ball and trying to 
get line drives and ground 
balls out into the defense 
and let it work. And I think 
that kept us calm and making 
adjustments quick in the game 
really helped us.”

Detroit Mercy isn’t the best 

team, but Iowa isn’t world-
beater either. Over the course 
of a 50-plus game season, the 
Wolverines have to stay true 
to the game plan at hand, even 
the mundane parts like hitting 
ground balls over towering fly 
balls or home runs.

A team like Purdue might 

not be the most talented 
team on Michigan’s schedule, 
but the Wolverines’ last two 
games offer a good example of 
what can happen when a team 
eschews the mundane for 
the more exciting. Purdue is 
just 8-24, 0-5 against ranked 
teams and just gave up 24 runs 

in two games.
Michigan 
is 

42-2 
in 
their 

last 44 games 
against 
the 

Boilermakers, 
but 
if 
the 

Wolverines 
lose 
focus, 

any series can 
become a little 
too interesting.

In all aspects 

of 
softball, 
it 

would serve Michigan well to 
remain one way and one way 
only: grounded.

RIAN RATNAVALE

Daily Sports Writer

“... Making 

adjustments quick 

in the game really 

helped us.”

In Final Four, focus will be on Moritz Wagner again

ON 
A 
MEGABUS 

SOMEWHERE IN TEXAS — 
The Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s season began with Moritz 
Wagner set to be the focal point of 
the team.

The junior forward still is, 

especially on offense, as his ability 
to spread out opposing defenses 
gives the rest of the Wolverines 
room to operate.

But over the course of the year, 

through the ups and downs of a 
season that’s stretched far longer 
than anyone could have expected, 
Wagner has taken on both leading 
and supporting roles. In part, it’s a 
testament to Michigan’s offensive 
depth.

“If you watch Wagner,” said 

Wolverines coach John Beilein 
in Thursday’s press conference, 
“he’d have a monster of a game 
and then somebody else does it.”

Now, though, in the Final 

Four, on the biggest stage of any 
Michigan player’s career, Wagner 
will be more important than ever.

With any team the Wolverines 

play, the big-man matchup draws 

extra attention. If Michigan plays 
a team with a bruising, post-up 
five, people wonder whether 
Wagner can hang defensively or 
if the hulking opponent has the 
stamina to stick with Wagner 
when he’s on offense. If an 
opponent has a smaller, finesse 
big, the focus shifts to whether 
Wagner’s post-up game is good 
enough to capitalize on a rare size 
advantage.

Enter 
Loyola-Chicago’s 

Cameron 
Krutwig, 
Wagner’s 

matchup in Saturday’s game. The 
6-foot-9, 250-pound freshman 
who averages 10.3 points per game 
— 8.8 in the NCAA Tournament — 
presents an interesting matchup 
for Wagner.

Krutwig is quite possibly the 

least versatile defender on the 
Ramblers, and though he is crafty 
on the offensive end, he isn’t 
exactly the most skillful player.

It seems like a matchup that 

Wagner can take advantage of. 
On paper, he’s quicker and more 
skilled, but Krutwig has shown up 
in matchups where he seemed to 
have a disadvantage before.

Against Tennessee, in the 

Round of 32, Krutwig held Grant 

Williams, the co-SEC Player of 
the Year, to just 12 points in 34 
minutes. Williams is more of the 
bruising type, but the point still 
stands that Krutwig can and has 
shown up in matchups when he 
wasn’t supposed to. So it isn’t like 
it’s going to be a cakewalk for 
Wagner.

If the Wolverines do beat the 

Ramblers to get into the title 
game, Wagner’s role will be just 
as pronounced whether they face 
Kansas or Villanova.

The Jayhawks have Udoka 

Azubuike at the five. He would 
probably be the most athletic 
matchup Wagner has seen all 
season. So there, it would be 
interesting to see if Wagner could 
put up enough of a fight against 
Azubuike to slow him down.

If Michigan were to get the 

Wildcats on Monday, it would face 
a team with very few weaknesses. 
If there is one, it’s that Villanova 
is a bit undersized. There again, 
the question is if Wagner can 
capitalize in the post to spur the 
Wolverines’ offense.

None of this is new, as Wagner 

has faced different matchups 
from different teams all season. 

Sometimes, like Beilein says, 
he’s taken advantage and been a 
dominant force. Sometimes he’s 
taken a backseat.

Wagner has even felt pressure 

before. Opposing teams gameplan 
for him, and opposing crowds boo 
him wherever he goes.

“They hate me everywhere,” 

Wagner said the day before 
Michigan’s first round matchup 
with Montana. “I know that. It’s 
fun. I’ve kind of embraced that 
role. And I’ve got to be honest, 
I’d hate myself, too. I just tell 
myself, ‘They hate you because 
I’m good.’ ”

But this is the Final Four. 

The 
attention 
paid 
towards 

particular matchups grows, and 
the blame placed on the loser of 
that matchup is more intense.

If Wagner doesn’t play his 

best, Michigan runs the risk of 
having its trip to San Antonio 
shortened. That could be said 
about the whole tournament, but 
with the grander stage and better 
competition, it’s true now more 
than ever.

For the Wolverines, it starts 

Saturday against Loyola. For 
Wagner, it starts with Krutwig.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Moritz Wagner leads the team in points and rebounds per game and has another important matchup down low against Loyola’s Cameron Krutwig.

a series aimed at telling the stories of 
female athletes, coaches and teams at 
the University from the perspective 
of the female sports writers on staff. 
Daily sports writer Aria Gerson 
continues the series with this story.

Lou Allan still gets chills 

thinking about it.

She stood on the podium — gold 

medal around her neck — watching 
as the flag went up and listening as 
the Star-Spangled Banner played.

Young girls sat in the stands 

wearing USA T-shirts, starstruck, 
already wishing that they could 
stand up there one day. And among 
the audience was one person 
who had been there, who knew 
the indescribable feeling, whose 
footsteps Allan had followed: her 
grandma, Sheila Cornell-Douty.

Even now, it’s a moment Allan 

will never forget.

***
Growing up in the 1970s, Cornell-

Douty didn’t have a lot of female 
role models to look up to. Most 
women athletes didn’t get much 
attention back then, and her sport 
— softball — got even less. Instead, 
she idolized Los Angeles Dodgers 
first baseman Steve Garvey.

Watching the Olympics was a 

family affair. Her mom had played 
several sports growing up, and 
her grandma had been involved 
with the Girls’ Athletic Club. 
From the time Cornell-Douty 
was in elementary school, the 
three would gather and watch the 
Olympics together. Cornell-Douty 
was enthralled, and she knew she 
wanted to compete there someday. 
But at that time, the idea of 
competing in the Olympics was just 
as unrealistic as that of donning 
Dodger blue and patrolling first 
base. Softball, after all, wasn’t an 
Olympic sport, and softball was 
what she loved.

But then that all changed. The 

International Olympic Committee 
announced that softball would 

become an Olympic sport, effective 
in 1996. Cornell-Douty would be 36 
then, at the twilight of her career. 
She knew this was her shot, and she 
knew she had to go for it.

She quit her job as a physical 

therapist 
and 
developed 
her 

own training regimen. She went 
to 
camps, 
tournaments 
and 

showcases. She was constantly 
under 
a 
microscope. 
Despite 

competing against much younger 
athletes, she made the team. It had 
all been worth it.

“(The Olympics were) something 

unlike anything else,” Cornell-
Douty said. “ … We opened against 
Puerto Rico and I remember we 
were lined up on the sidelines and 
they were announcing the teams 
and I was getting tears in my eyes 
since I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this 
is really it. This is for real. I’m 
really in the Olympics. We’re really 
playing.’ ”

And the most surreal moment 

of all was standing on the podium, 
gold medal around her neck, 
as Team USA was honored for 
winning the first-ever Olympic 
softball tournament.

***
Allan started t-ball at age five. 

It was only natural, given the 
pedigree of her grandma — who 
went on to win another gold medal 
in 2000 and was inducted into the 
National Softball Hall of Fame and 
the International Softball Hall 
of Fame. Though many families 
pushed their kids into the sports 
they had played, Cornell-Douty 
didn’t want her granddaughter 
to be pressured by the weight of a 
legacy. The first thing on Cornell-
Douty’s agenda was just to let Allan 
play.

“I felt it was extremely important 

from a very young age, number 
one was that she came to me and 
wanted to practice and work out 
and do all of that stuff,” Cornell-
Douty said. “ … This is t-ball, she’s 
out there to just go play and enjoy 
the game and have fun and learn 
some stuff, but you know, she’s five 
years old.”

When Cornell-Douty attended 

Allan’s first game, she walked in 
late to find her granddaughter 
already on base. But not for long.

“She comes running off the base 

and she came running to us like, ‘Hi 
grandma! Thanks for coming to my 
game!’ ” Cornell-Douty said. “And 
then she ran back.”

That’s 
when 
Cornell-Douty 

knew she was doing something 
right.

When Allan was around 10, she 

decided she wanted to follow in 
her grandma’s footsteps and play 
softball at a high level. She had 
seen Cornell-Douty’s medals and 
began to dream of earning some 
of her own. So Cornell-Douty and 
her husband built a batting cage 
and fielding area, and the former 
softball star began training the 
future one.

Like her grandma, Allan became 

one of the top players in the country. 
Like her grandma, she played first 
base and earned a scholarship to a 
top program — UCLA for Cornell-
Douty and Michigan for Allan. Like 
her grandma, she had her sights set 
on one thing: the Olympics.

But Allan’s Olympic dreams 

weren’t 
always 
a 
foregone 

conclusion. In 2006, the IOC voted 
to leave softball off the schedule 
for the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. 
Cornell-Douty, along with other 
former Olympic softball players, 
wrote letters and lobbied endlessly 
to reinstate the sport they loved. 
And in 2016, the decision was 
official: for 2020, Olympic softball 

was back on.

Still, though, the future of 

Olympic softball is uncertain. The 
IOC hasn’t made a decision yet on 
the 2024 Olympics, and it’s possible 
that 2020 could be Allan’s only shot.

“I was super excited that it 

got put in,” Allan said. “ … 2020 is 
obviously the (next) one so that is 
my goal to get to it in the first part. 
(But) there’s so many different 
people that are older than me that 
have so much more experience 
that are coming back, I don’t know 
necessarily if I’m gonna make the 
team or not.”

Whatever 
happens, 
Allan 

already has a taste of the Team USA 
experience. In 2017 — the summer 
before she began her freshman year 
at Michigan — she was chosen for 
the USA Junior National Team. The 
United States went 9-0 to take the 
gold medal at the Junior Women’s 
Softball World Championship in 
Clearwater, Fla.

There are plenty of parallels 

between Allan’s experience and her 
grandmother’s. After all, both had 
the defining experience of standing 
on a podium, wearing gold medals 
as their flag was raised.

“You can’t beat that,” Allan said. 

“I mean, you see your flag and you 
see everything going on around 
you and all these people and all 
these little girls that are like, ‘Oh 
my gosh, USA!’ and hearing the 
USA chant and all that stuff is so 
incredible that you can’t describe it. 
… You’re representing something so 
much bigger than yourself and that 
is incredible.”

But their shared understanding 

goes beyond just the thrill of a 
championship. In a sport where 
professional leagues don’t get much 
attention, college and national 
team players are the famous ones 
that every young girl aspires to be.

“There’s always that intensity 

and it’s just a good thing for little 
girls to watch and look up to,” Allan 
said. “The more women’s sports we 
have in the Olympics is great for 
these little girls to look up to and 
show that they have something to 
look forward to.”

Cornell-Douty 
remembers 

touring in the months leading up 
to the Olympics, traveling to big 
cities and towns so small they 
were barely on the map. There, the 
team would attend games, and at 
each one, a steady stream of fans 
came out, waiting for autographs. 
Sometimes, they were there until 
one or two in the morning.

Allan, too, visits with fans 

waiting outside the locker room. 
She loves the feeling of knowing 
that they admire her. It gives her 
something to play for.

Cornell-Douty takes her job as 

a role model seriously because she 
grew up at a time when women 
in sports existed mostly in the 
shadows. She wants the next 
generation of athletes — Allan’s 
generation — to grow up knowing 
that their possibilities are endless.

Allan does it with a different 

perspective: she remembers being 
one of those girls, idolizing her 
grandma and former Michigan 
second baseman Sierra Romero. 
Now that she’s reached some of the 
highest heights imaginable for a 
player her age, she wants to give a 
similar experience to others.

“If I can sit out there and see all 

these different girls waiting for me, 
then I’m doing something right,” 
Allan said. “I’m giving them hope 
that they have something to look 
forward to and that’s all I want in 
the world is to make a difference.”

But for Allan, softball isn’t an 

endpoint. She has bigger plans for 
the future. She wants to go to law 
school, have a career in public 
policy and become an advocate. 
Maybe it’s not all that different 
from softball, anyway. After all, 
she and her grandma are proof that 
for women, the sky is the limit. She 
knows the transformative power of 
a role model. And she knows what 
it’s like to be part of something 
bigger than herself.

“Softball’s … taught me (the 

skills),” Allan said. “But once I 
leave the sport, there’s something 
more beyond, there’s a next 
chapter in my life that I have to 
open up.”

Newfound confidence sparks Wolverines to win streak

On March 14, the Michigan 

baseball team lost to the NAIA’s 
Lawrence Tech. Or, as coach Eric 
Bakich describes it, they didn’t 
just lose, they were “totally 
outplayed.” The loss dropped the 
Wolverines to 4-11, two losses 
and 38 wins short of their 2017 
totals.

Fourteen days later, the loss 

total remains mired at 11 — 
and zero in Big Ten play — as 
Michigan is riding a nine-game 
win streak.

“At 4-10, everything is an 

area for improvement,” Bakich 
said after the previous loss, to 
Lipscomb in Nashville.

At the time, this may have been 

interpreted as the Wolverines 
needing to improve offensively, 
defensively and on the mound. 
The biggest change, though, did 
not come from any of those areas.

Instead, 
after 
the 
loss 

to 
Lawrence 
Tech, 
Bakich 

pinpointed a different problem.

“We got to utilize these 

cameras and see everything,” 
Bakich said, motioning to the 
various 
cameras 
postioned 

around Ray Fisher Stadium. 
“We got to see the dugout, see 

the behind home plate view, see 
everything.”

It was that ability to see its 

dugout that reversed Michigan’s 
fortunes. Bakich realized the 
team’s demeanor was not one of 
a winning program. So he held 
a two-part film session: half to 
show his players their dejected 
body language in the dugout, the 
other half a compilation of the 
program’s storied legacy.

“That loss to Lawrence Tech 

kind of opened everyone’s eyes,” 
said freshman outfielder Jordan 
Nwogu. “In practice (the day 
after the game), we noticed that 
we were down as a team and 
were not getting behind each 
other. Friday (against Bowling 
Green), we turned that right 
around and everyone had each 
other’s backs.”

Added Bakich: “It wasn’t until 

we played Lawrence Tech … that 
the lightbulb really went off.”

The 
obvious 
blessing 
in 

disguise for the Wolverines came 
in that loss to the Blue Devils. A 
similar victory in defeat, though, 
came in their loss to San Diego 
State two weeks earlier. Bakich 
was 
ejected 
with 
Michigan 

holding a lead in a marquee 
win opportunity, one it would 
ultimately lose by one run.

“I had to watch the game 

from 
outside 
the 
stadium,” 

Bakich said. “And I could see 
(the dugout) from outside the 
bubble.”

It was then that he first 

realized his team had an energy 
problem.

“Something was missing early 

on,” Bakich said. “And it wasn’t 
just that we were playing good 
opponents. It just didn’t feel 
right, it didn’t sound right, there 
wasn’t a whole lot of energy.”

The key for the Wolverines 

turned out to be a simple one: 
having fun playing baseball.

“It’s okay to have childlike 

enthusiasm 
and 
energy 
out 

here,” Bakich said. “This is 
supposed to be a playground. We 
use that phrase a lot that this is 
a playground, but we weren’t 
playing like we were having a 
whole lot of fun. It looked more 
like a chore.”

Bakich’s claims are evident on 

the field. Against Lipscomb and 
Lawrence Tech, many Michigan 
players sat on the bench in the 
bottom of the dugout while their 
foes across the field filled the 
stadium with the unmistakable 
chirps of a baseball dugout.

Now, the roles are reversed. 

Every Wolverines run — and 

there are a lot of them — is met 
with the entire team spilling out 
of the dugout. Players climb over 
each other for perches on the top 
step to cheer on their pitchers on 
the rare occasions that they find 
themselves in a jam.

“It’s really easy to get down,” 

said freshman first baseman 
Jesse 
Franklin. 
“But 
when 

you look in the 
dugout and you 
see 
everyone’s 

smiling faces and 
everyone joking 
around, it gives 
you confidence.”

While 
most 

of 
Michigan’s 

wins 
in 
this 

streak have been 
blowouts, 
they 

have twice found 
themselves 
in 

6-0 holes.

“6-0 down, (our attitude was), 

‘who cares?’ ” Nwogu said. “We 
need to get these runs and help 

our pitchers out. It was just a 
light flicker that went off (after 
Lawrence Tech).”

Much of the credit for the 

turnaround will rightfully be 
attributed to Bakich, but it is 
his players — from freshmen to 
seniors — who have blossomed 
into vocal leaders after losing 
11 players to the draft in the 

offseason.

“(The 

upperclassmen) 
have done a great 
job of showing 
leadership,” 
Bakich 
said, 

“and taking the 
younger 
guys 

under 
their 

wings.”

Added Nwogu: 

“In the dugout, 
right before (an) 

at-bat (against Bowling Green, 
freshman 
right-hander 
Jeff 

Criswell) told me, ‘Just swing as 
hard as you can and you’ll hit it 

out.’ ”

Two minutes later, a baseball 

was nestled in a grass lot beyond 
the left field fence, and Nwogu 
was being mobbed by teammates 
at home plate.

That leadership extends to 

the team’s role players. The first 
name both Bakich and Franklin 
named when asked about their 
clubhouse leaders was redshirt 
sophomore 
left-hander 
Ben 

Keizer — who has pitched all of 
four innings this season.

“It may not always be one 

guy who’s giving the speech,” 
Bakich said, “but a lot of guys 
who are just speaking up more 
consistently, and that’s helped 
everybody.

“They were sick of losing. At 

some point, enough is enough. 
And at 4-11, that was enough.”

Just two weeks later, the 

Wolverines find themselves in 
an enviable position. One quick 
glance at the dugout would tell 
you that.
