CAMPUS IMPROVEMENTS
Athletic Dpt. reveals plan
for South Campus reva-mp

Renovations
expected to total
$250 million
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
The University's Athlet-
ic Department released the
framework for its $250-million
long-term plan to renovate ath-

letic facilities throughout South
Campus.
The department launched
a new website on Monday to
explain its needs, illustrate pro-
posals for facility upgrades and
solicit donations.
At the Big Ten Conference's
spring meetings, University
Athletic Director Dave Brandon
said that much of the athletic
campus needed improvements.
Brandon said the plan would

call for $250 million in South
Campus-wide renovations to be
completed in the next seven to
10 years.
"We've really taken our entire
campus footprint and said,
'What do we need to do to get all
of our facilities lifted to a point
where we really feel we would
be competitive with any other
campus location for a national
tournament," Brandon told
AnnArbor.com. "So, our stan-

dard would be to have facilities
in every sport that would make
us eligible as a site for regional
or national competition."
Though the site was launched
this week, the Athletic Depart-
ment spokesperson David
Ablauf declined to comment.
"All that we have to share is
what is in the new development
site and we won't be speaking
about the project scope, funding

CENTRAL STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Racklam Student Gov't
proposes secession from CSG

Move would result
in $215,000 loss
« of CSG annual
revenue
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Rackham Student Govern-
ment is leading the charge to
remove University graduate stu-
dents from the jurisdiction of

Central Student Government,
following an RSG executive order
that called for the creation of a
committee dedicated to drafting
ballot language for secession.
The move was instigated at
RSG's Thursday night meeting
in preparation for the November
student government election.
RSG president Michael Benson
said the proposed split, which
would result in CSG losing more
than $215,000 of annual rev-
enue, is a result of CSG's failure
to meet the concerns of graduate

students.
"Since I was elected to the
presidency (of RSG) a few years
ago, and even before that, RSG
has been looking to connect more
with our students, and also to
help have graduate students have
a larger impact on campus or at
least have our voices heard," he
said.

tion drafted by the Graduate and
Professional Student Assembly

Student Rights and Responsibilities
to receive triennial upgrades this fall

Twitter and Square founder Jack Dorsey speaks at the Chrysler Center on North Campus on Thursday.

Guidelines on
student behavior to
undergo overhaul
By ERIN FORSYTHE
Daily StaffReporter
This fall marks the beginning
of the triennial amendment pro-
cess for the Statement of Student
Rights and Responsibilities.
The statement, which outlines

the expectations of each Uni-
versity student, is altered every
three years to address overlooked
issues and to update its content
in an effort to reflect develop-
ments within the University and
on campus. The process encour-
ages student involvement, and
staff and faculty are also eligible
to contribute proposals.
Upon enrolling in the Uni-
versity, each student agrees to
comply with and accept the state-
ment and its guidelines. Most

Universities have similar codes
of conduct, but the University's is
unique because it was drafted by
students.
The document, which was
written in 1995, holds students
accountable for acts of miscon-
duct, such as hazing or using
other students' Mcards. In addi-
tion to listing possible violations
and their repercussions, the
statement outlines procedures for
resolution and appeals.

Jack Dorsey
recruits, makes
pitch to students
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
Jack Dorsey, Twitter cre-
ator and founder of the start-up
Square, is the man responsible
for transforming the pound sign
into the hashtag and molding
our thoughts into 140-character
musings. Now, he's redefining
his place in Silicon Valley.

At an event at the Chrysler
Center on North Campus on
Thursday, Dorsey touted the
fast-growing application Square,
launched in 2010 as a means to
simplify commercial transac-
tions between merchants and
customers. The service allows
smallbusinessownerstoconnect
a physical credit card reader to
their Apple and Android-based
mobile devices, replacing cash
registers that, according to
Dorsey, are unnecessarily cum-
bersome.
The event, a collaborative
event between the Center for

Entrepreneurship and the Soci-
ety of Women Engineers, hosted
nearly 200 students, some of
whom were Engineering stu-
dents, coding on their laptops
during the lecture.
A further innovation of
Dorsey's work, Square recently
launched a program allowing
customers to pay using their
mobile phone at businesses that
host the program. When down-
loading the application, users

NEWS BRIEFS
LANSING
Tape of Granholm
in 1978 'Dating
Game' surfaces
Ex-Michigan Gov. Jennifer
Granholm is getting some laughs
from a newly posted YouTube
video of her 1978 appearance on
"The Dating Game."
Marty Nislick of Bayside, N.Y.,
says he spotted a video of the TV
show on the Facebook page of a
friend who was one of the three
male contestants vying for a date
with the 19-year-old aspiring
actress from British Columbia.
Nislick tells the Detroit Free
Press he recognized Granholm
and posted an edited video on
YouTube last week.
Granholm now hosts a talk
show. Ex-gubernatorial spokes-
woman Liz Boyd says she emailed
Granholm a link to the video and
spoke with her about it Thursday.
PHILADELPHIA
Mohammed Ali
wins civic award
Retired boxing great Muham-
mad Ali has been awarded the
Liberty Medal in Philadelphia.
The award was presented in
a ceremony at the National Con-
stitution Center on Thursday.
It recognizes his longtime role
as a fighter outside the ring for
humanitarian causes, civil rights
and religious freedom.
A frail Ali did not speak, but
stood with assistance to receive
the medal from his daughter,
Laila. His wife Lonnie said Ali was
honored and humbled to be a bea-
con of liberty.
Since hanging up his gloves in
1981, Ali has traveled extensively
on international charitable mis-
sions and devoted his time to
social causes.
DALLAS
Anonymous hacker
arrested in Texas
A Texas man linkedto the
worldwide hacking group Anony-
moushasbeendetainedbythe FBI
over accusations that he threat-
ened a federal agent, his attorney
said Thursday.
Barrett Brown, 31, of Dallas was
arrested Wednesday night and
booked into the Dallas County jail,
according to jail records. Brown
was then transferred into FBI
custody, Dallas County sheriff's
spokeswoman Carmen Castro said.
Brown's attorney, Jay Leider-
man, told The Associated Press
that he expected Brown to be
charged with making threats to
a federal agent. Leiderman said
the accusations are connected to
YouTube videos Brown posted in
recent days.
The mostrecentvideo postedto
Brown's account is entitled in part,
"Why I'm Going to Destroy FBI
Agent Robert Smith." In it, Brown
rails against federal authorities
for what he describes as an unfair
investigationofhim and his moth-
er, who he said was not involved in

any of Anonymous' activities.
AZAZ, Syria
Syrian rebels offer
to release hostages
A Syrian rebel commander
holding 10 Lebanese Shiites hos-
tage said Thursday he is willing
to release the men but fears doing
so could set off a wave of reprisal
attacks by Sunni extremists.
What began as an effort to force
Lebanon's Shiite militant group
Hezbollah to stop supporting the
Syrian regime has become the
latest flashpoint in a conflict with
growing sectarian overtones.
The rebel leader behind the
kidnappings, Ammar al-Dadikh-
li, is a burly former cross-border
trader who goes by the nom
de guerre Abu Ibrahim. His
1,200-strong Northern Storm
Brigade controls the vital cross-
ing from Syria's Aleppo province
into neighboring Turkey, and in
May he ordered the seizure of the
Lebanese Shiites, who had been
on a bus tour of religious sites
in the area, on the grounds they
belonged to Hezbollah.

Hundreds of
students flock to
president's home
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily NewsEditor
The white house nestled
between the Clement's Library
and Tappan Hall on South Uni-
versity Avenue may seem out of
place to newer students, but it's
not long before they discover
it as the University President
Mary Sue Coleman's home.
On Thursday, students of all
ages and from all disciplines
flocked to Coleman's annual
open house for the chance to
mingle with the president.
Before meeting Coleman, E.
Royster Harper, the Univer-
sity's vice president for student
affairs, greeted students enter-
ing Coleman's home.
"I love the fact that our presi-
dent says this is my house, this is
your house, come meet me, come
see me, and that she will stay
here the entire time in heels,"
Harper said.
Coleman stood at the back of

the house where hundreds of
students waited to talk with her
individually and take pictures.
"I think it's important for
students who would like to see
the house to come in and see it,"
Coleman said. "There are two
groups that I really enjoy: the
new students coming either for
their undergraduates or gradu-
ate studies - their first time in
Ann Arbor - and then 1 love for
the seniors to come because it's
the last year."
Coleman said she looks for-
ward to the open house every
year as a way to get to know the
students.
"People always tell me great
things, and I'm excited to hear
about what people are studying
and where they're from, so I get
a lot of enjoyment out of this,"
Coleman said.
Harper added that having the
open house serves as a way to
unite campus.
"I think that it's real easy for
this to just be a place, rather
than a community, and so I
think that anytime we can open
up our home and our hearts to
each other that it makes us a
different kind of community,"

Harper said.
Inside the President's House,
students could roam the rooms
on the main floor, sign Cole-
man's guest book and munch on
cookies and fruit while sipping
apple cider.
CSG President Manish
Parikh, a Business senior, said it
was his first time visiting Cole-
man's house.
"I think this event is really
important because it sends out
a strong signal to every student
on campus that their president,
Mary Sue Coleman, is there for
them and an extremely warm
and kind lady," Parikh said. "I
think she'd win a poll for the
coolest university president."
In the house's library, sisters
Amber and Brianna Campbell
pointed to the wood floor and
laughed together, saying it was
the same as their grandmother's.
Amber, an LSA freshman,
said she came to the event after
hearing about it at new student
convocation and asked her older
sister to come with her.
"It reminds me of the White
House," Brianna, an LSA sopho-
more, said. "It's really cozy and
neat and clean and just pretty."

$250,000 grant
from Hyundai will
aid in research
efforts
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily News Editor
Instead of cramming for
exams and heading to parties
with his classmates, Andrew
Harris, then a 19-year-old stu-
dent at Bowling Green State
University, was in the hospital
receiving a bone marrow trans-
plant for acute myeloid leuke-
mia.
Harris survived the trans-
plant despite suffering a graft-
versus-host disease, the most
dangerous complication associ-
ated with bone marrow trans-
plants. Now, 10 years later,
Harris is working to develop
a method to diagnose GVHD
in children before symptoms
develop, with the help of a
$250,000 grant from Hyundai
Hope on Wheels, a non-profit
organization sponsored by
Hyundai Motor America and
Hyundai dealerships.
"I was the big kid on the chil-
dren's floor back in college,"
Harris said. "I promised the
doctors here that I would come
back and work with them if I
survived my whole ordeal and
it took me 10 years to get back
here."
At a Thursday morning press
conference, Harris was award-
ed the $250,000 check and a
new lab coat in the presence of
colleagues and pediatric bone
marrow transplant patients.
Harris said the funding will
makea significant difference in
his career and childhood can-
cer research.
"This study is going to lay
the groundwork for making
bone marrow transplants a
safer treatment option for kids
around the world," he said.
According to Valerie Castle,
pediatrics and communicable
diseases chair at C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital, less than
3 percent of the National Insti-
tutes of Health's budget goes
toward research for childhood
cancer, even though it is one of
the leading causes of childhood
death in the country.
Brian O'Malley, regional
general manager at Hyun-
dai Motor America, said the
mission of Hyundai Hope on

Wheels is to eliminate child-
hood cancer and emphasize
the importance of supporting
related research.
The organization originally
started as a grassroots effort
but grew with support from
contributions from the auto-
maker. Since the program was
started 14 years ago, Hyundai
has donated more than $57
million to pediatric cancer
research.
O'Malley added that a con-
tribution is made to the orga-
nization for every Hyundai
vehicle sold. Harris's work is
one of the 41 projects chosen
from 300 applicants to receive
a grant ranging from $100,000
to $250,000.
Harris began his project by
developing a panel of blood
tests to predict whether a
child will be affected by GVFD
before symptoms are present.
This project is set to become
a national study at Mott Chil-
dren's Hospital and the Chil-
dren's Oncology Group, the
world's largest children's can-
cer treatment research consor-
tium, beginning in January.
"We've got the preliminary
groundwork, but now we need
all the samples and data from
children all around the country
so we can make this predictive
test," Harris said.
Daniel Lee, a 23-year-old
inpatient and a former LSA
student who was six credits
short of graduation before his
diagnosis, took part in a cer-
emony at the event yesterday in
which pediatric bone marrow
transplant patients decorated
a Hyundai SUV that will be
sold at the Ann Arbor Hyundai
dealership on Jackson Road
with their handprints.
"You can never have enough
money for advances in medical
science," Lee said. "Even right
now with all of the advance-
ment in technology, it's real-
ly tough for children going
through chemo, nausea is hard
on the body."
Mitchell Dybalski, a 4-year-
old neuroblastoma patient, got
to put his handprint on the car.
Dybalski was diagnosed in July
and is one of many children
that could benefit from this
grant.
"Every penny counts,"
Dybalski's mother, Tracy
Dybalski, said. "It's nice to see
big companies coming together
and providingthe needed fund-
ing for childhood cancers."

Xi is expected to
take over as head of
Communist Party
this year
BEIJING (AP) - New rumors
about health problems facing
China's leader-in-waiting Xi
Jinping swirled Thursday as the
government continued to stone-
wall on commenting on his con-
dition or whereabouts 12 days
after he dropped from sight.
Official media mentioned Xi
for the first time since his last
appearance on Sept. 1, but the
brief, obscure report failed to
explain the extended absence
that has sparked the rumors.
The reports said Xi, Presi-
dent Hu Jintao and other top
officials had expressed their

condolences "through vari-
ous means" for the death of
102-year-old former general
Huang Rong last week. The
Guangxi Daily newspaper
reported no other details. Iden-
tical reports were carried on
the websites of the Communist
Party and the official Xinhua
News Agency.
China's vice president, Xi is
due to take over as Communist
Party head later this year and as
president next year as the coun-
try transitions to a new genera-
tion of leaders. His prolonged
and unexplained disappear-
ance has sparked rumors and
raised questions about the sta-
bility of the succession process.
For a fourth consecutive day,
Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hong Lei refused to offer any
information on Xi.
Early rumors said Xi, 59,

threw his back out swimming
or pulled a muscle playing foot-
ball. As the days passed, the
speculation escalated to more
serious conditions, including a
heart attack, stroke, or emer-
gency surgery.
And on Thursday, Hong
Kong's Information Center for
Human Rights and Democracy
said a small cancerous growth
had been discovered on Xi's
liver on Sept. 2 and that he had
undergone surgery to remove it
this week at the elite military
301 Hospital in Beijing. The
center said he was expected to
reappear in public next week.
A man who answered the
phone at the hospital's admin-
istrative office said he did not
know whether Xi was being
treated there. But he dismissed
reports on Xi's condition as
guesswork.

United Nations nuclear monitoring
body condemns Iranian enrichment

Agency fears
Iranian pursuit of
. nuclear weapons
VIENNA (AP) - The 35-nation
board of the U.N. nuclear agency
overwhelmingly rebuked Iran
on Thursday for refusing to heed
demands that it take actions to
diminish fears that it might be
seeking atomic arms, a move
hailed by the United States as
demonstratinginternational pres-
sure on Tehran to compromise.
Only one country - Cuba -
voted against a resolutionbrought
before the International Atomic
Energy Agency board and drawn
up by the United States, Russia,
China, Britain, France and Ger-
many. Ecuador, Tunisia and Egypt
abstained, while the 31 other
nations supported the resolution.
Iran denies any interest in
nuclear arms. But it has refused
to comply with U.N. and IAEA
demands to stop activities that
could be used to make such
weapons and to allow a probe of
suspicions it worked on an arms
program.
Robert Wood, the chief U.S
delegate to the IAEA, said he
hoped he board's near-solid back-
ing for the resolution would serve
as a wake-up call for the Islamic
Republic to heed international
demands to replace its words
with actions that prove it has no
interest in nuclear weapons.
"What we are hoping is that
this resolution will keep ... dip-
lomatic pressure up and con-
vince Iran that it has really no
other option than to comply
with its international obliga-
tions," he told reporters.
But the resolution has its limi-

tations, despite the broad support
it received.
As 11 others before it, the
document cannot be enforced
by the IAEA board, and as such,
may be shrugged off by Tehran,
which already is ignoring U.N.
Security Council sanctions and
other increasingly harsh inter-
national penalties meant to
force it to compromise.
Iran appeared unimpressed
Thursday. The country's chief
IAEA delegate, Ali Asghar
Soltanieh, said pressure on his
country came from "a few West-
ern countries, especially the
United States (which) are try-
ing to change the IAEA into a

mere U.N watchdog" trying to
penetrate countries' national
security.
Because it is largely symbolic,
the document is also unlikely
to persuade Israel that diplo-
macy is working. Israel views a
nuclear-armed Iran as a mortal
threat, citing Iran's persistent
calls for the destruction of the
Jewish state, its development
of missiles capable of striking
Israel, and Iranian support for
Arab militant groups.
Israeli government leaders
have become increasingly stri-
dent in suggesting that only mil-
itary action will stop Iran from
getting nuclear arms.

Think with your heads
NCAA should work to prevent concussions
fter only two weeks of collegiate football, USA Today report-
ed 15 concussions among injured NCAA players. In 2008,
the Boston University School of Medicine released a state-
ment linking repeated concussions to Chronic Traumatic Encepha-
lopathy. Describing CTE as "a progressive degenerative disease of
the brain," the university connected CTE to "the development of
memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, paranoid and aggres-
sive behavior, depression, dementia, and Parkinsonism." With thir-
teen weeks left, the NCAA should take action to reduce the number
of concussions and protect players.

An apology for America's values is never
the right course."
- Republican Presiderial candidate Mitt Romney said in criticism of a White House
statement responding to the recent U.S. Embassy attacks in Libya on Wednesday.
Get caught in the act

;

With such serious consequences, any
number of concussions - let alone 15 - is
too many. In early 2011, retired NFL player
Dave Duerson, complaining of symptoms
similar to those of CTE, shot himself in the
chest. Prior to his suicide, Duerson left a mes-
sage requesting that his brain be studied for
CTE. The condition can only be diagnosed
postmortem. The BUSM concluded that, at
only 50 years old, Duerson had been suffer-
ing from "moderately advanced CTE." Since
then, former NFL players Junior Seau and
Ray Easterling have also committed suicide,
unable to cope with the onset of symptoms.
Easterling was discovered to have devel-
oped CTE, and Seau was suspected of having
developed the early stages.
Football fans must also be made aware of
the gravity of injuries like concussions. The
fact that concussions can cause serious, long-
lasting effects is an unfamiliar concept to
fans and players alike. Even fewer are aware
of how frequently concussions occur. Retired
NFL safety Miles McPherson explains,
"There is no football player - maybe a punt-
er - that has not had multiple concussions."
Awareness needs to be promoted among
youth, since many of these long-term effects
can be incurred at a young age. In 2009, a
BUSM study showed that CTE can develop
even in college players who never go profes-

sional, finding "early signs of the disease" in a
deceased 18 year-old.
The concussion epidemic is substantiated
by a strong desire to win that may be misinter-
preted by players as a responsibility to play. At
the University especially, the importance of
a winning season can become inflated. Such
an environment can create unreasonable
expectations for concussed players to return
to the game, further risking their health and
future. While winning is not the responsibil-
ity of players, football fans are responsible for
offering a level of understanding and concern
to the players they root for.
Just as fans are accountable for a compas-
sionate football culture, the NCAA is respon-
sible for player safety. The NCAA must focus
on refining its rules to reduce the likelihood
of injuries and clarify its definition of concus-
sions to improve sideline detection of con-
cussed players.
As Dr. Robert Cantu of BUSM observes,
"Young men and women are voluntarily
exposing themselves to repetitive brain trau-
ma without full knowledge of the potential
consequences, and the rules of the games are
designed without an appreciation for the risks
carried by the players." This is a problem that
requires the cooperation of all those involved
in NCAA football to develop a cohesive solu-
tion and promote safety.

Though I'm aware - sometimes

The glass ceiling seems to be thinning.
More women are accepted into medical
schools and are on their way to becoming
lawyers and business owners. Women have
even made a considerable dent in the world
of CEOs, but one frontier women have barely
grazed is the world of film direction.
In the 83 years of the Academy Awards only
four women have ever been nominated for
Best Director: Linda Wertmuller for "Seven
Beauties," Jane Campion for "The Piano,"
Sofia Coppola for "Lost in Translation" and
Kathryn Bigelow for "The Hurt Locker." Out
of 413 nominations for Best Director, only
one woman - Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 - has
ever won.
In2011, only5 percentoffilmdirectors were
women. Even fewer are actually employed by
major Hollywood studios. Most female direc-
tors gravitate toward documentary or inde-
pendent filmmaking. Only 18 percent of all
backstage work in the film industry is done
by women. It's hard to find another industry
where women are so chronically absent.
Hollywood is a male-dominated indus-
try and most Hollywood movies target male
audiences. It's a perfect example of an "old
boy's network." Most director gigs are given
because of connections or are based on repu-
tation, and no formal interview is ever con-
ducted. The people who are respected and
have the most pull in Hollywood are men.
Age, achievements and esteem are extreme-
ly important in film, and these can only be
achieved with time, time most women have
not yet attained.
Hollywood is a business of money. The
highest priority of any studio is box-office
profits. Most blockbuster movies involve
guns, violence, sex and female nudity. While
movies like "Magic Mike" and the "Twilight"
franchise showed that male bodies sell just as
well as female ones, these movies were still
directed by men. Employers don't believe
that a female director could pull off the level
of gun-toting nutheads needed to produce
the desired profits. Female directors are least
likely to be involved in action, horror and

animated features, the backbone genres of a
profitable summer blockbuster.
Additionally, directors are burdened with
the task of translating a screenplay into a
visual experience. Directors have to make
quick decisions. As a woman, I can tell you
that I rarely make a decision without look-
ing at every possible outcome, talking it over
with at least three different people and tak-
ing a night to sleep on it. Many women are
much more in their heads than men, analyz-
ing and over-analyzing everything - not the
most efficient quality in a director.
A director is in charge of numerous people.
Not to pull out stereotypes, but as manag-
ers, studies show assertive women are liked
less than men. I don't want to put the blame
on men and come off as a radical feminist. I
am educated enough to know that men and
women's minds work differently. Some might
say it's harder for a woman to execute a large-
scale film. But this is refuted by the fact that
female CEOs outnumber female film directors
by three times. It is my thought that powerful
women are not drawn to the arts. Instead, they
go into business and become those CEOs.
Films directed by women are also more
likely to pull in female crowds. The 'chick
flicks' of the Hollywood scene are therefore
directed by women to attract a female audi-
ence. Nora Ephron's "Julie and Julia" as well
as Anne Fletcher's "The Proposal" are per-
fect examples. The romantic comedy has long
been dominated by female characters, direc-
tors and audiences. However, it's not uncom-
mon to see a man directing a romantic comedy
like Adam Brody's "Definitely, Maybe," but
you would be hard-pressed to find a woman
directing Michael Bay's "Transformers."
My view is that as society continues to
promote more women to executive positions,
the gender gap in the film world should nar-
row, just like everything else. This should be
especially true as women become presidents
of major film companies and increasing the
hiring of female directors.

ELI CAHAN|
Three days ago was the 11th anni-
versary of September 11th, a mind-
blowing, horrific and tragic day.
Every year, families mourn the loss
of loved ones who, for no reason
other than the flag on their lawns, or
maybe just the geographical location
of those lawns, were put to death.
I use "put to death" because that's
what it was - an execution. The
term "homicide" has some room for
accident or mishap. "Execution" is
fully and decisively intentional. So
it was an execution of innocent citi-
zens who, for all we know, may have
been perpetuating a Middle Eastern
economy with their trades. They
clearly didn't deserve to have their
lives taken. I honor the lost, those
who died in the frame of fifty stars
and thirteen stripes.
I remember that day - it was the
first day of third grade at my private
school on the Upper East Side of
Manhattan. Just as the teacher had
gotten one ofthe girls to stopbawling
over her separation from her mother,
we were instructed to remain seated
at our tables. Our parents were com-
ing to pick us up, said the teacher.
Sweet deal, I thought. So I waited.
And waited. And waited. Finally, my
friend's dad came to get me. This day
just keeps getting better. Igleamed.As
I strode through the park with my
friend, his dad and my twin brother,
we spoke of Star Wars. We walked

lever forget

into his house and rushed to the bed-
room, glimpsing at the TV, which
seemed to be broken. The screen was
black and seemed fuzzy. We found
a board game and hustled back into
the living room only to realize that
the TV screen wasn't black, but was
showing a gray image. All gray: a
video feed from a helicopter circling
the Twin Towers, which lay col-
lapsed, smoke so dark and so expan-
sive you'd think you were watching
Lost. Or maybe you wouldn't think
that-but that day meant little more
than a play date to a nine year-old.
So in retrospect, what was the
significance of that day? What is the
significance of that day now? Well,
there is something about tragedy
that seems to create community -
something about loss that allows
us, for one brief instant, to appre-
ciate what we have. Funerals unite
families and wars unite countries.
But it always seems a melancholy
gathering, one in which fifty stars
don't twinkle so bright and thirteen
stripes blur together.
Days lce September 11th remind
us to stop and stare and soak it all
in. In 2001, it was a stunned stop,
and a frightened stare. I, for one,
am still soaking it all in. Appreciate
what you have, because it could be
gone in an instant. That's the mes-
sage - life lasts for a long while
and disappears in a fleeting solemn

second. So, appreciate your life as it
lasts. Not "while,"but "as." "While"
indicates that you have something
else going on. Life is all that mat-
ters - embrace it every second
of every day. Appreciate the lives
around you, because death is not
dealt based on "deserving." No one
deserved death less than the vic-
tims of 9/11.
Instead of mourning death 11
years after, we must learn to honor
and celebrate life. Those who died
in the attacks wouldn't want us
to suffer in remembrance of their
executions for crimes they didn't
commit. We must take life - ours
and others' - seriously every day.
Don't live it like it's your last, that's
too much of a cliche. How- about
you live it like it's your first - your
first time meeting the person you
love, your first time discovering
something you love, your first time
visiting a place you love, your first
time seeing a sight you love so very
much. It's about what you have, not
what you don't.
Eleven years later, we're still here
though those we love may not be. I
invoke the phrase "Never Forget."
I think we should always remem-
ber - remember to live and to love,
to learn and to listen, to see and to
hear, and to touch and to be touched.

said.
The project is expected to be in
conjunction with the university-

The Athletic Department,
which is financially independent
from the University, currently
receives 4 percent of its annual
income from donations.
The South Campus master

change is the addition of a 'Walk

that students feel graduate and
undergraduate student govern-
ments should be separate, then
the framework of what the gradu-
ate student government will look
like will be examined during win-
ter semester, Benson said.
At a very preliminary level,
Benson said the $7.19 per semes-
ter that the more than 15,000
graduate students pay to CSG and
the $1.50 per semester they pay
to their respective school or col-
lege student government would
become a flat $8 fee.
Of the $8, $2 would go to the
childcare fund, $4 would go the
student's college or school's stu-
dent government and $2 would go
to the new over-arching graduate
student government, Benson said.
He added that under the current
system every student pays $1 to
the childcare fund. The new $8
plan would increase funding to
the graduate school student gov-
ernments and childcare and fund
the new all-graduate govern-
ment.
CSG, however, would lose
more than one third of its annual
funding. In total, CSG collects
more than $600,000 through a
semesterly fee of $7.19 from each
student. Graduate student seces-
sion would account for a loss of
than $215,000 each year.
RSG vice president Kaitlin
Flynn said CSG does fund some

activities for graduate students,
but the undergraduate-centric
focus of CSG, coupled with the
limited funds of RSG, leads to
graduate student organizations
coming to RSG for money that
the organizatoin doesn't have.

"one complete, contiguous ath-
letic experience that will be as
impressive in its scale as it is in
its vision.".
The proposal calls for trans-
planting the Michigan volley-
ball team from Cliff Keen Arena,
where it is currently housed, to a
new multi-purpose arena located
behind the Ray Fisher Stadium,
replacing the Indoor Track Build-
ing that is now located there.
New indoor and outdoor track
and field facilities, rowing facil-
ity and a lacrosse stadium will be
erected at the edge of South Cam-
pus, joining the wrestling, gym-
nastics and soccer complex on the
southern edge of the U-M Golf
Course, according to the plan.
Two aspects of the project -
renovations to Yost Ice Arena
and Crisler Center - are already
underway.
In total, the new Athletic
Department website highlights
17 areas of South Campus that
will be overhauled within the
next decade under the proposed

$250-million project.
Though the Athletic Depart-
ment has not unveiled the full
plan, every indication is that Cliff
Keen Arena and Ferry Field -
where the football team played
from 1906-26 - will be no more
once the plan is made a reality.
"The Cliff Keen Arena has
served us well, but it doesn't pro-
vide individualized resources
for our sports that rely on this
facility," the website reads. "Our
vision is to transform the space
ensuring that our wrestling, vol-
leyball and gymnastics teams
will compete in a facility which
will make them the envy of our
conference, and on par with their
national rivals."
The site includes a map that
shows a large parking lot in place
of Ferry Field.

ner of Hoover Street and State

door" to South Campus and con-
nect to a renovated and expanded

identity and allowing them to pay
electronically with the touch of a
button.
Square recently announced
a partnership with Starbucks,
which will begin using the ser-
vice at all of its locations this fall.
In an interview before the
event, Dorsey said despite the
differing natures of his work at
Square and Twitter, they both
draw on similar principles.
"When we really looked at it,
payments and money were not
that dissimilar from communi-
cation - it's just an exchange
of value," he said. "So it's actu-
ally very similar to what we were
doing with Twitter, it's just a dif-
ferent application."
According to Dorsey, Square
was conceived when co-founder
Jim McKelvey had difficulty sell-
ing his work at an art fair to those
who wanted to use credit cards.
As Square developed, they real-
ized the service would appeal
to a variety of small businesses
owners, who according to Dors-
ey, were "just waiting for a solu-
tion" for their credit card reading
problems.
However, Dorsey said he
doesn't believe other forms of
payment will become obsolete.
"It's not that we must remove
paper money or credit cards from
this world," he said. "We believe
there's a better experience to be
had, and we're working on that. "
He added that the new card-
free feature of Square is a result

of his belief that commercial
transactions should be simpli-
fied.
"I order the cappuccino, I get
the cappuccino," he said. "It just
works. It should be that fluid. You
never should have to worry about
taking your wallet out. "
Dorsey told aspiring entre-
preneurs at the event to take
advantage of opportunities to
build relationships with profes-
sors and peers while they are
surrounded by an array of intel-
ligent minds.
"The biggest thing is to find
people who will really push you
to go higher, to be better," he
said. "Find people who convince
you to get out of your head and
really create stuff. Find people to
collaborate with."
During his presentation,
Dorsey told students the product
initially gained popularity with
bands that were able to easily sell
merchandise with Square, and
showed a short film featuring the
band Silent Comedy to demon-
strate its use.
He noted that the service has
spread to many other businesses,
and shows no sign of slowing
down its expansion.
In fielding questions about his
career, Dorsey urged students to
pursue their own ideas with the
same fervor.
"If you have an idea, get it out
of your head," he said. "Get it into
code, get it into conversation,
draw it out. That's the best way to
actually do something, (because)
if you don't get it outof your head,
you're going to make excuses for
why it can't be done."

Friday, September 14, 2012 - 5A
The event was also a recruit-
ment opportunity for potential
Square employees. Dorsey has
toured numerous universities,
including Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity and the University of
Pittsburgh to recruit.
His team chose the University
because of its interdisciplinary
programs that combine areas of
study such as business, engineer-
ing and entrepreneurship, Dors-
ey said.
University alum Kyle Zink, the
director of corporate brands for
Square, said the company makes
an effort to have a presence on
campuses around the country.
"From a student standpoint,
there are a lot of start-ups in Sili-
con Valley that seem really far
away and unattainable," he said.
"If you're really interested in a
company, be proactive. Reach out
and be part of the conversation."
Students who don't plan to
pursue a career at Square can still
use the application for activities
on campus, such as buying and
selling textbooks, paying indi-
vidual tutors through credit card
and discovering new local busi-
nesses, Dorsey said.
Currently, more than 1,000
individuals and small businesses
in Ann Arbor use Square, includ-
ing Comet Coffee in Nickel's
Arcade and Iorio's Gelateria on
E. William Street. During the
event, one student asked Dorsey
if he thought it would become the
primary vehicle for commercial
transaction in the near future.
"I use it every day in San Fran-
cisco," he responded. "So the
future is already here."


with its recommendations before
University President Mary Sue
Coleman makes the final decision
on changes to the policy.
As program manager, Mitchell
is directly involved with develop-
ment of the statement and actively
meets with students who have
been accused of violatingthe code.
She also aids in informing them of
their rights and offering resolu-
tion options.
Mitchell said updating the doc-
ument is important to meet the
needs of a constantly changing
University.
"(The framers of the statement)
recognized that as a culture and
as a community we would evolve
over time, and so they wanted

to make sure that the statement
meets the needs of the communi-
ty," she said. "And so they created
this amendment process."
Mitchell referred to a proposal
she received this year regarding
cyber bullying, noting that it's
indicative of the need to amend
and maintain the policy to keep
up with how the student body is
changing.
In addition to submitting pro-
posals, students are encouraged
to attend community dialogues
where potential amendments will
be presented and discussed. The
meetings will be held Sept. 19 and
27 and a Google Plus Hangout will
serve as a virtual meeting place for
those unable to attend.


Currently, Rackham and sev-
eral other schools and colleges
with graduate students at the
University hold many seats on
the CSG assembly, but few gradu-
ate students actively fill those
seats. Rackham has 10 allotted
seats - with 57 total seats in the
assembly - and eight are vacant.
During discussion of the new
committee, one member of RSG
questioned if secession was nec-
essary and suggested that greater
participation in CSG could solve
graduate representation prob-
lems.
Benson, who has served as a
representative on the CSG assem-
bly and the CSG General Counsel,
said CSG rarely discusses issues
affecting graduate students.
"The undergraduates, and
this is by no means disrespectful
toward them, they didn't quite
grasp some of the issues with
(graduate students)," he said.
Specifically, Benson said big
issues over the last few years for
undergraduate students and CSG
- including the open housing ini-
tiative and Saturday night dining
- typically have little bearing on
graduate students, adding that
the reverse is true for undergrad-
uate students.
"Oftentimes graduate students
honestly don't really care about
some the issues that affect under-
graduates and vice versa," he said.
While two separate student
governments with a budget over
$100,000 would be alien to the
University, Benson said it is actu-
ally quite common at other insti-
tutions.
"Every other school in the Big
Ten that has a student govern-
ment ... has separate and equal
graduate professional student
governance, as well as under-

graduate student governance as
the issues are really unique and
separate," he said.
Despite the possibility of hav-
ing two major student govern-
ments on campus, Benson said
this does not rule out graduate
and undergraduate students
working together or having grad-
uate students serve CSG.
"For the issues where there is
overlap, at these other schools,
there is a great deal of collabora-
tion," he said.
While the assembly does have
several seats open for graduate
students that do not have regu-
larly attending representatives,
there has still been graduate stu-
dent representation. The current
chair of the rules committee, for
instance, is a law student.
Benson said the committee
and the potential move to a new
graduate student government
will take multiple semesters
"We don't want to jump the
gun," he said.
The creation of a separate
graduate student government
would likely require changes to
the all campus constitution, and
Benson said there are multiple
avenues to achieving this. He
cited petitioning CSG, convinc-
ing the assembly to amend the
all-campus constitution or going
straight to the University's Board
of Regents.
"I'm not sure at this point ... if
the undergraduates would even
have a say in this, truthfully,"
Benson said. "We want to work
collaboratively with undergradu-
ates, but at the end of our day,
our main focus here is ensuring
proper representation and giving
proper voice to the graduate and
professional student bodies on
campus."

Agency fears
Tehran's pursuit of
nuclear weapons
VIENNA (AP) - The 35-nation
board of the U.N. nuclear agency
overwhelmingly rebuked Iran
on Thursday for refusing to heed
demands that it take actions to
diminish fears that it might be
seeking atomic arms, a move
hailed by the United States as
demonstrating international
pressure on Tehran to compro-
mise.
Only one country - Cuba -
voted against a resolution brought
before the International Atomic
Energy Agency board and drawn
up by the United States, Russia,
China, Britain, France and Ger-
many. Ecuador, Tunisia and Egypt
abstained, while the 31 other
nations supported the resolution.
Iran denies any interest in
nuclear arms. But it has refused
to comply with U.N. and IAEA
demands to stop activities that
could be used to make soch
weapons and to allow a probe of
suspicions it worked on an arms
program.
Robert Wood, the chief U.S
delegate to the IAEA, said he
hoped he board's near-solid back-
ing for the resolution would serve
as a wake-up call for the Islamic
Republic to heed international
demands to replace its words with
actions that prove it has no inter-
est in nuclear weapons.
"What we are hoping is that
this resolution will keep ... diplo-
matic pressure up and convince
Iran that it has really no other
option than to comply with its
international obligations," he told
reporters.

But the resolution has its limi-
tations, despite the broad support
it received.
As 11 others before it, the docu-
ment cannot be enforced by the
IAEA board, and as such, may be
shrugged off by Tehran, which
already is ignoring U.N. Secu-
rity Council sanctions and other
increasingly harsh international
penalties meant to force it to com-
promise.
Iran appeared unimpressed
Thursday. The country's chief
IAEA delegate, Ali Asghar Solta-
nieh, said pressure on his country
came from "a few Western coun-
tries, especially the United States
(which) are trying to change the
IAEA into a mere U.N watchdog"
trying to penetrate countries'
national security.
Because it is largely symbolic,
the document is also unlikely to
persuade Israel that diplomacy is
working. Israel views a nuclear-
armed Iran as a mortal threat, cit-
ing Iran's persistent calls for the
destruction of the Jewish state,
its development of missiles capa-
ble of striking Israel, and Iranian
support for Arab militant groups.
Israeli government leaders
have become increasingly stri-
dent in suggesting that only mili-
tary action will stop Iran from
getting nuclear arms. For the six
powers sponsoring the resolution,
the onus at the Vienna meeting
was thus to prove that unified
international diplomatic pres-
sure could still be exerted on the
Islamic Republic - even if it was
largely symbolic.
Israeli chief delegate Ehud
Azoulay questioned whether the
resolution would have its intend-
ed effect, telling the board that
"Iran's race towards the nuclear
bomb has not been slowed down

by well-meaning resolutions."
Tehran insists its nuclear pro-
gram is for peaceful purposes
only. But it refuses foreign offers
of reactor fuel if it stops mak-
ing its own through uranium
enrichment. Enriching uranium
is a process that worries the inter-
national community because it
could be used to arm nuclear war-
heads too.
The IAEA also suspects that
Iran has worked secretly on
nuclear arms - allegations Iran
dismisses as based on fabricated
U.S. and Israeli intelligence.
The six powers behind the res-
olution included Russia and China
- which often speak out against
harsh punishment for Iran - as
well as the United States, Britain,
France and Germany, and West-
ern diplomats described the back-
ing of Moscow and Beijing for the
resolution as an example of unity.
In exchange, however, the four
Western powers had to settle
for compromise language in the
text of the resolution, which was
weaker overall than the last one
in November.
While expressing "serious
concern" over continued Iranian
uranium enrichment in defiance
of the U.N. Security Council,
the six nations say they back the
"inalienable right" of countries
that have signed the Nuclear Non-
proliferation Treaty to develop
nuclear energy for peaceful pur-
poses. That is a bow to arguments
by Iran, an NPT signatory, that it
has a right to enrich uranium.
The resolution "stresses" that
the IAEA has not reported any
nuclear material missing from
Iran sites it is monitoring. Miss-
ing material could mean that
Tehran is using it elsewhere for
weapons purposes.

Libyan security
force infiltrators
revealed safehouse
location
BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) -
Heavily armed militants used a
protest of an anti-Islam film as
a cover and may have had help
from inside Libyan security in
their deadly attack on the U.S.
Consulate, a senior Libyan offi-
cial said Thursday.
As Libya announced the first
four arrests, the clearest picture
yet emerged of a two-pronged
assault with militants scream-
ing "God is great!" as they scaled
the consulate's outer walls and
descended on the compound's
main building.
The rampage killed the U.S.
ambassador and three other
Americans.

Eastern Libya's deputy inte-
rior minister, Wanis el-Sharef,
said a mob first stormed the con-
sulate Tuesday night and then,
hours later, raided a safe house
in the compound just as U.S. and
Libyan security arrived to evac-
uate the staff. That suggested,
el-Sharef said, that infiltrators
within the security forces may
have tipped off the militants to
the safe house's location.
The attacks were suspected to
have been timed to coincide with
the 11th anniversary of the Sept.
11, 2001, terrorist strike in the
United States, el-Shareftadded,
with the militants using the film
protest by Libyan civilians to
mask their action.
Killed in the attack were U.S.
Ambassador Chris Stevens,
information management offi-
cer Sean Smith, private secu-
rity guard Glen Doherty and one
other American who has yet to
be identified.

EI-Sharef said four people
were arrested at their homes
Thursday, but he refused to give
any further details. He said it
was too early to say if the sus-
pects belonged to a particu-
lar group or what their motive
was. Libya's new prime minis-
ter, Mustafa Abu-Shakour, said
authorities were looking for
more suspects.
One of five private security
guards at the consulate said the
surprise attack began around
9:30 p.m. when several grenades
that were lobbed over the outer
wall exploded in the compound
and bullets rained down.
The guard was wounded in the
left leg from shrapnel. He said he
was lying on the ground, bleed-
ing and in excruciating pain
when a bearded gunman came
down the wall and shot him
twice in the right leg, screaming:
"You infidel, you are defending
infidels!"

MEXICO CITY (AP) - A man
believed to be the leader of the
Gulf drug cartel, which controls
some of the most valuable and
violently contested smuggling
routes along the U.S. border, was
arrested by Mexican marines
and presented to the public
Thursday morning.
The capture of Jorge Edu-
ardo Costilla Sanchez is a major
victory in the military battle
against drug trafficking, but it
could open a power vacuum and
intensify a struggle south of the
Texas border in northeast Mex-
ico, a region that has seen some
of the most horrific violence
in the country's six-year war
among law-enforcement and
rival gangs.
Adm. Jose Luis Vergara, a
navy spokesman, said the burly,
mustachioed man detained
Wednesday evening in the Gulf
port of Tampico was the capo
known as "El Coss." One of
Mexico's most-wanted men, the
41-year-old is charged in the
U.S. with drug-trafficking and
threatening U.S. law enforce-
ment officials. U.S. authorities
offered $5 million for informa-
tion leadingto his arrest.
Clad in a blue plaid shirt and
bulletproof vest, the suspect was
presented along with 10 body-
guards, five with bruised faces
and clad in camouflage military
fatigues similar to those of the
marines who held them captive.
The navy also showed dozens
of assault weapons, some pis-
tols that appeared gilded and
studded with jewels, and sev-
eral expensive-looking watches
seized in the operation.
"This is avery, very important
arrest," said Guadalupe Correa-
Cabrera, chair of the Depart-
ment of Government at the
University of Texas, Browns-
ville, and an expert on politics
and crime in the Gulf Cartel's
territory in the state of Tamau-
lipas.
She said the Gulf Cartel was
a vertically structured orga-
nization dependent on its top

leaders, several of whom have
been arrested in recent months.
Now, she said, she expects a
surge in violence between the
two remaining dominant car-
tels in Mexico - the Pacific
Coast-based Sinaloa Cartel run
by Mexico's most-wanted man,
Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman,
and the brutal paramilitary
Zetas, the former enforcement
arm of the Gulf Cartel.
"It consolidates this new con-
figuration of organized crime
in Mexico," Correa-Cabrera
said. "This disintegration of the
Gulf Cartel will be impacting
in a very serious way the levels
of violence in Tamaulipas and
probably in the whole country."
Vergara said five of Costil-
la's guards had been arrested
Wednesday morning in Rio
Bravo, Tamaulipas. Another five
fled when marines tried to arrest
them in Tampico, and the chase
led authorities to Costilla's hide-
out, he said.
Costilla shook his head when
asked if he had anything to say
about the charges against him
and when asked if he had a law-
yer.
The Matamoros-based Gulf
Cartel was once one of Mexico's
strongest. While -it was badly
weakened in recent years by
battles with other gangsters and
by law-enforcement operations,
it smuggled and distributed tons
of cocaine, methamphetamine,
heroin and marijuana into the
United States under the leader-
ship of the Cardenas Guillen
family, three brothers who took
over from one another as their
siblings were captured or killed.
Costilla was born in Matam-
oros, across the border from
Brownsville, Texas. He worked
for several years as a local police
officer before allegedly joining
the Gulf Cartel in the 1990s and
becoming a lieutenant for then-
leader Osiel Cardenas Guillen.
After Cardenas Guillen was
arrested in 2003 and imprisoned
in the U.S., officials say Costilla
joined the capo's brother Eze-
quiel in running the cartel. The
tumult at the top prompted the 9
powerful Sinaloa cartel to move
in from its base along the Pacific
Coast and launch awar for con-
trol of Nuevo Laredo, the busi-
est cargo crossing between the
United States and Mexico.

New York officially passes
controversial soda-pop ban

Volcanic ash spews from the Volcan de Fuego as seen from Palin, south of Guatemala City, on Thursday.
Volcano in Guatemnala
erupts, cities e vacuate

Thousands
displaced as ash
reduces visibility
ESCUINTLA, Guatemala
(AP) - A long-simmering vol-
cano exploded with a series of
powerful eruptions outside one
of Guatemala's most famous
tourist attractions on Thurs-
day, hurling thick clouds of ash
nearly two miles (three kilome-
ters) high, spewing rivers of lava
down its flanks and prompting
evacuation orders for more than
33,000 people from surround-
ing communities.
Guatemala's head of emergen-
cy evacuations, Sergio Cabanas,
said the evacuees were ordered
to leave some 17 villages around
the Volcan del Fuego, which
sits about six miles southwest
(16 kilometers) of the colonial
city of Antigua, home to 45,000
people. The ash was blowing
south-southeast and authori-
ties said the tourist center of
the country was not currently in
danger, although they expected
the eruption to last for at least
12 more hours.
Hundreds of cars, trucks and
buses, blanketed with charcoal
grey cash, sped away from the
volcano along a two-lane paved
highway toward Guatemala
City. Dozens of people crammed
into the backs of trucks. Thick
clouds of ash reduced visibility
to less than 10 feet in the area
of sugarcane fields surrounding
the volcano. The elderly, women

and children filled old school
buses and ambulances that car-
ried them from the area.
Authorities set up a shelter at
an elementary school in Santa
Lucia, the town closest to the
volcano, and by Thursday night
people had started trickling in.
Most were women and children
carrying blankets and going
into bare classrooms.
Miriam Carumaco, 28,
arrived to the shelter along with
16 members of her family.
"We heard loud thunder and
then it got dark and ash began
falling," Carumaco said. "It
sounded like a pressure cooker
that wouldn't stop."
Carumaco said parents sent
their children to school despite
the darkening skies, but that
classes were later cancelled and
teachers walked them home.
The emergency agency said
lava rolled nearly 2,000 feet
(600 meters) down slopes bil-
lowing with ash around the
Volcan del Fuego, a 12,346-foot-
high (3,763-meter-high) volcano
whose name translates as "Vol-
cano of Fire."
"A paroxysm of an eruption
is taking place, a great volcanic
eruption, with strong explo-
sions and columns of ash," said
Gustavo Chicna, a volcanologist
with the National Institute of
Seismology, Vulcanology, Mete-
orology and Hydrology. He said
cinders spewing from the vol-
cano were settling a half-inch
thick in some places.
He said extremely hot gases
were also rolling down the sides

4

of the volcano, which was almost
entirely wreathed in ash and
smoke. The emergency agency
warned that flights through the
area could be affected.
There was a red alert, the
highest level, south and south-
east of the mountain, where,
Chicna said, "it's almost in total
darkness."
He said ash was landing as
far as 50 miles (80 kilometers)
south of the volcano.
By Thursday evening, the ash
plume had decreased to a little
more than a mile high, partly
due to rain, which diminished
the potential risk to aviation, said
Jorge Giron, a government volca-
nologist. He said ash continued to
fall heavily, however, and advised
residents near the volcano but
outside of evacuation zones to
clean their water systems before
using them, and to not leave their
homes because of the ash.
He said a red alert would be
in effect until 4 a.m. local time.
Teresa Marroquin, disaster
coordinator for the Guatemalan
Red Cross, said the organization
had set up 10 emergency shel-
ters and was sending hygiene
kits and water.
"There are lots of respiratory
problems and eye problems,"
she said.
Many of those near the volca-
no are indigenous Kakchikeles
people who live in relatively
poor and isolated communi-
ties, and authorities said they
expected to encounter difficul-
ties in evacuating all the affect-
ed.

Board of Health
regulations likely
to be challenged in
court
NEW YORK (AP) - New York
City cracked down on the sale of
supersized sodas and other sug-
ary drinks Thursday in what was
celebrated by some, as a ground-
breaking attempt to curb obesity
but condemned by others as a bla-
tant intrusion into people's lives
by a busybody mayor.
Public health experts around
the nation - and the restaurant
and soft-drink industry - will
be watching closely to see how
it goes over among New Yorkers,
a famously disputatious bunch.
Barring any court action, the
measure will take effect in March.
The regulations, approved eas-
ily by the city Board of Health,
apply to any establishment with
a food-service license, including
fast-food places, delis, movie and
Broadwaytheaters, the concession
stands at Yankee Stadium and the
pizzerias of Little Italy. They will
be barred from serving sugary
beverages in cups or bottles larger
than 16 ounces.
No other U.S. city has gone so
far as to restrict portion sizes at
restaurants to fight weight gain.
"We cannot continue to have
our kids come down with diabe-
tes at age 6," said Mayor Michael
Bloomberg.
The mayor rejected suggestions
that the rule constitutes an assault
on personal liberty. "Nobody is
banning anything," he said, noting
that restaurant customers can still
buy as much soda as they want, as
long as they are willingto carry it
in multiple containers.
He said the inconvenience is
well worth the potential public
health benefit, and likened the
city's actions to measures taken
decades ago to phase out lead in
household paint.
Others, though, likened the ban

to Prohibition. A New York Times
poll last month showed that six
in 10 New Yorkers opposed the
restrictions.
"It's aslipperyslope.When does
it stop? What comes next?" said
Sebastian Lopez, a college student
from Queens. He added: "This is
my life. I should be able to do what
I want."
The restrictions do not apply
to supermarkets or most conve-
nience stores, because such estab-
lishments are not subject to Board
of Health regulation. And there
are exceptions for beverages made
mostly of milk or unsweetened
fruit juice.
(Because convenience stores
are exempt, the rules don't even
apply to 7-Eleven's Big Gulp, even
though the belly-busting serving
of soda has become Exhibit A in
the debate over Americans' eating
habits.)
Some health experts said it isn't
clear whether the ban will have
anyeffect on obesity. But theysaid
it might help usher in a change in
attitude toward overeating, in the
same way that many Americans
have come to regard smoking as
inconsiderate.
The regulations follow other
ambitious health moves on Bloom-
berg's watch, many of which
were attacked as a push toward a
"nanny state."
Yet some have proved to be
national trendsetters, such as
making chain restaurants post cal-
ories on their menus. The city has
also barred artificial trans fats in
french fries and other restaurant
food, cracked down on smoking
and promoted breast-feeding over
formula.
The Board of Health approved
the big-soda ban 8-0, with one
member, Dr. Sixto R. Caro,
abstaining. Caro, a doctor of inter-
nal medicine, said the plan wasn't
comprehensive enough.
Others spoke forcefully of the
need for action to deal with an
obesity crisis.
"I feel to not act would really
be criminal," said board member

Susan Klitzman, director of the
Urban Public Health Program
at Hunter College. City Health
Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley
called the rule "a historic step to
address a major health problem of
our time."
The restaurant and beverage
industries complained that the
city is exaggerating the role sug-
ary beverages have played in mak-
ing Americans fat.
"This is a political solution and
not a health solution," said Eliot
Hoff, a spokesman for an industry-
sponsored group called New York-
ers for Beverage Choices, which
claims to have gathered more than
250,000 signatures on petitions
against the plan.
He said the group is considering
suing to block the rule.
"We will continue to voice our
opposition to this ban and fight for
the right of New Yorkers to make
their own choices. And we will
stand with the business owners
who will be hurt by these arbi-
trary limitations," Hoff said in a
statement.
Enforcement will be carried
out by New York City's restaurant
inspectors. Violations will carry a
$200 fine.
Complying might prove compli-
cated for some establishments.
Starbucks is trying to figure
out whether the regulations bar
it from selling its calorie-packed
Frappuccinos in the 24-ounce size.
Another issue could be iced cof-
fee, which many cafes sweeten
with liquefied sugar. Customers
might have to add the sweetener
themselves.
Fast-food restaurants with self-
serve soda fountains will be pro-
hibited from giving outcups larger
than16ounces, but people will still
be allowed refills.
Manhattan pizza shop owner
Vinnie Siena said halting sales of
large sodas will hurt his already
thin profit margin, unless he raises
prices.
"I'm having a tough time as it
is. They don't want the little guy
to survive, it seems," he said.

Nation says goodbye to Neil
Armstrong in D.C. ceremony

Buzz Aldrin,
0 John Glenn, other
astronauts pay
respects
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
nation bid farewell Thursday to
Neil Armstrong, the first man to
take a giant leap onto the moon.
The pioneers of space, the
powerful of the capital and the
everyday public crowded into the
Washington National Cathedral
for a public interfaith memorial
for the very private astronaut.
Armstrong, who died last
month in Ohio at age 82, walked
on the moon in July 1969.
"He's now slipped the bonds
of Earth once again, but what a
legacy he left," former Treasury
Secretary John Snow told the
gathering.
Apollo 11 crewmates Buzz
Aldrin and Michael Collins, Mer-
cury astronaut John Glenn, 18
other astronauts, three NASA
chiefs, and about two dozen mem-
bers of Congress were among the
estimated 1,500 people that joined
Armstrong's widow, Carol, and
other family members in the cav-
ernous cathedral.
Collins read a prayer tailored
to Armstrong's accomplishments
and humility. A moon rock that
the Apollo 11 astronauts gave the
church in 1974 is embedded in one
of its stained glass windows.
"You have now shown once
again the pathway to the stars,"

Eugene Cernan, the last man to
walk on the moon said in a trib-
ute to Armstrong. "As you soar
through the heavens beyond even
where eagles dare to go, you can
now finally put out your hand and
touch the face of God."
Cernan was followed by a slow
and solemn version of "Fly Me to
the Moon" by singer Diana Krall.
The service also included
excerpts from a speech 50 years
ago by John F. Kennedy in which
he said America chose to send
men to the moon by the end of the
1960s not because it was easy, but
because it was hard. The scratchy
recording of the young president
said going to the moon was a goal
that "will serve to organize and
measure the best of our energies
and skills, because that chal-
lenge is one that we're willing to
accept, one we are unwilling to
postpone."
Shortly after that speech in1961
at Rice University, Armstrong,
not yet an astronaut but always
a gifted engineer, was already
working on how to land a space-
ship on the moon, NASA admin-
istrator Charles Bolden recalled.
Snow talked of the 12-year-old
Armstrong who built a wind tun-
nel. But most of Armstrong's
friends and colleagues spent time
remembering the humble Arm-
strong. Snow called him a "regu-
lar guy" and "the most reluctant
of heroes."
Bolden, a former astronaut, said
Armstrong's humility and cour-
age "lifted him above the stars."
"No one, but no one, could have

accepted the responsibility of his
remarkable accomplishment with
more dignity and more grace than
Neil Armstrong," Cernan said.
"He embodied all that is good and
all that is great about America."
Bolden read a letter from Presi-
dent Barack Obama saying, "the
imprint he left on the surface of
the moon is matched only by the
extraordinary mark he left on
ordinary Americans."
Armstrong commanded the
historic landing of the Apollo 11
spacecraft on the moon July 20,
1969. His first words after step-
ping onto the moon are etched in
history books: "That's one small
step for man, one giant leap for
mankind." Armstrong insisted
later that he had said "a" before
man, but said he, too, couldn't
hear it in the recording.
Armstrong and Aldrin spent
nearly three hours walking on
the lunar surface while Collins
circled above the moon. In all, 12
American astronauts walked on
the moon before the last moon
mission in 1972.
Armstrong was a U.S. Navy
aviator. He joined NASA's prede-
cessor agency in 1955 as a civilian
test pilot and later, as an astro-
naut, flew first in Gemini 8 in
1966. After the moon landing he
spent a year in Washington as a
top official at the space agency,
but then he left NASA to teach
aerospace engineering at the
University of Cincinnati. He later
was chairman of two electronics
companies, but mostly kept out of
the public eye.

EVENT PREVIEW
Second City to bring

Chicago-based
troupe celebrates
50th anniversary
By JONATHAN ODDEN
Daily Arts Writer
When talking about Chicago,
there are two distinct epochs:
the crime, corruption and pizza
that marked
its pre-The Second C4

days; and the Tonight and
crime, corrup- tomorrow
tion, pizza and at 8 p.m.-

defines it today. Ter
The Set- $25
ond City, an
improvisation group that not
only put Chicago on the come-
dic map, but also launched too
many stars to name, turns 5O
this year. In celebration of their
golden anniversary they've put
together "Laughing Matters," a
special best-of-the-best sketch
show that will open tonight at
The Ark.
"It's an understatement to say
it's been hard to look back on the
decades and decades of mate-
rial and pare that down to only
a two-hour show," said Jessica
Mitolo, Second City member and
director of "Laughing Matters."
"Imagine combing through and
having to choose between a
sketch by Stephen Colbert and
one by Steve Carell - difficult."
However, this dauntingly
large catalog of sketches repre-
sents exactly what The Second
City is known for: unbridled
creativity and a proclivity for
tackling every topic swirling
around their actors and audi-
ences heads. And that, Mitolo
explained, comes from the pro-
cess of improv.
"All the sketches (the audi-
ence) will see are generated
from ideas submitted by the
actors, which are improvised in
front of live audiences again and
again until they become solidi-

Dead eyes, still hearts, will lose.

The show will feature historic skits from Second City alums, like Stephen Colbert.

fied enough to be considered a
script," Mitolo said.
For those worried that a
scripted, "best of" show doesn't
have the same immediacy and
punch that improv might bring,
Mitolo explained that there's
still the same audience interac-
tion and spontaneity driving the
show.
"There's a beautiful part of
improv where you mightnever see
it again and that's still true in this
show," Mitolo said. "Not to over-
state it, but the audience is vital to
the set. The actors are stillfeeding
off the audience, reacting to what
they find funny and adapting to
make the show as humorous for
them as possible."
As for the show's material,
Mitolo explained they tried
to bring a little of everything
together while writing.
"You'll see material by big
names from their early days, but
you're also going to see some
of the most current pieces still
being preformed on our main
stages," Mitolo said. "But on a
level of material too, it ranges
from politics and race, to mur-
der mysteries and even more
bizzare."
The Second City has always
been defined by its topical imme-

diacy, and even in "Laughing
Matters," where source material
can at times be decades old, the
humor hopes to come through.
"You'd be, surprised at how
muchsomethings don't change,"
Mitolo said. "Especially during
an election year, the issues of
race, news outlets, politics are
very cyclical. And even if some
of the topical pieces aren't as
immediate anymore, the way
we've approached that mate-
rial - by focusing on timeless
relationships - keeps it present,
keeps it funny."
To emphasize this, one might
consider that though "hanging
chad" jokes aren't totally rel-
evant anymore, the issues and
relationship of voter fraud and
voting regulation is still as per-
tinent now as it was 12 years ago.
It's these broader social strokes
that the show captures, Mitolo
explained.
"In the end, we're comedi-
ans and the show is there to be
funny," Mitolo said. "Maybe
audience members don't agree
always with the material, but
hopefully the show encourages
an arena where everything is at
play, everything is on the table
and everything can become part
of the humor."

as the pilot

"She's a doctor! A mob doctor!"
Grace Devlin (Jordana Spiro,
"My Boys") is an ordinary Chi-

The episode reveals that

Wolverines not overlooking Minutemen

the Minutemen
are in their first
season of FBS competition after
making the move from Division-1
FCS play. They spent last week
getting throttled by Big Ten bot-
tom-feeder Indiana, 45-6.
As if that weren't enough rea-
son to take this Saturday's game
lightly, the Wolverines are also
well aware that a primetime
matchup with rival Notre Dame
looms just a week away.
But despite all the reasons to
overlook Massachusetts, players
and coaches alike insist that they
aren't succumbing to that tempta-
tion.
"I think we've done a nice job
of taking them one at a time," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke. "But
at the same time, it doesn't mat-
ter who you're playing. It's really
about us and how we prepare
and how we improve and how we
practice every week.
"Every week the discussion
starts with us and what we need
to do as a football team."
Redshirt junior safety Thomas
Gordon echoed Hoke's senti-
ments when asked how the team
was making sure it focused fully
on Massachusetts, despite the
apparent lack of a challenge
that the Minutemen pose. Gor-
don pointed to Arkansas' loss to
Louisiana-Monroe last week to
emphasize how any team could
lose at any time.

turnover battle. (Michigan has
a minus-four turnover margin
through two games after finish-
ing last season at plus-seven.)
But the facet that Hoke men-
tioned that most will be watching
with a close eye is the Wolver-
ines' running game, particularly
with redshirt junior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint.
Senior quarterback Denard
Robinson proved against Air
Force that his legs are once again
a serious threat after he struggled
in the opener against Alabama.
But Michigan's running backs
have been stymied in both games,
including Toussaint, who man-
aged just seven yards on eight
carries against the Falcons in his
first game action of the season.
The position group to watch
is the offensive line, which took
responsibility for Toussaint's
poor performance. It's still trying
to develop cohesion after losing
two starters from last season.
"There are some growing pains
that go with that," said offen-
sive coordinator Al Borges. "But
I think the more the same five
work together, the better you're
going to see them play, and they
did some really nice things in
this game to spring Denard. ...
We gave him room to run, so now
we just have to take the next step
with our tailbacks.
"(Toussaint) and everyone else,
too."
Should the offense - particu-
larly the running game - be able
to find more consistent, sustained
success, Michigan's defense will
find itself with less pressure on
its shoulders after two subpar
efforts to open the season.
The good news for that unit
is Massachusetts won't present
nearly the challenges that Ala-
bama's uber-talented offense
and Air Force's confusing triple-
option system did.
But just like the team at large,
don't expect the Wolverine
defense to take the Minutemen
lightly.
"You can't overlook any oppo-
nent," Gordon said. "We're going
into this week with that mindset."

Redshirt junior tailback Fitzgerald Toussaint hopes to return toform this weekend after a dismal running attack vs. Air Force.

Massachusetts should prove
worthy of the Wolverines' atten-
tion for a number of other reasons
as well.
For one, it boasts a familiar
face in starting running back
Mike Cox, who used the NCAA
graduate rule to transfer there
after spending the last four years
in Michigan's backfield.
(Under the rule, players are
allowed to transfer to another
school without sitting out a year
if they complete their coursework
at their initial university and pur-
sue a program at their new insti-
tution that the original school
doesn't offer.)
All week, Gordon and his

teammates expressed happiness
for Cox's opportunity and said
they would be rooting for him
every week of the season except
this week.
And anyone on Michigan's
team who'arrived before Hoke
became the head man last season
will remember the last time that
the Minutemen came to Michi-
gan Stadium in 2010. Those Rich
Rodriguez-led Wolverines won
that game, but only after over-
coming a stiff challenge from
Massachusetts - they led by just
four points at halftime and had to
hold on for a narrow 42-37 win.
"I don't think we're particu-
larly thinking about that this

week," said fifth-year senior
center Elliott Mealer. "We're,
I think, focusing on Michigan
more so. We obviously have some
corrections we need to make on
ourselves. ... (But) that is a les-
son - we know we're going to get
everybody's best shot, so I think
we're always prepared for that."
Mealer isn't wrong in saying
his team has plenty to work on.
Luckily for Michigan, this game
should provide plenty of opportu-
nity for it to do so.
Hoke identified several areas
where he's looking for improve-
ment on Saturday, among them
increasing his offense's time
of possession and winning the

After an uncomfortably close victory over Air Force last
weekend, Michigan is ready for a cupcake game. By all accounts,
this matchup with Massachusetts should do the trick. The
Minutemen have just risen to the Division-I FBS level and lost
badly to Indiana last weekend. Running back Mike Cox is making
his return to Ann Arbor, so be on the lookout for that storyline.

2012 Schedule

Alabama (Sept.1): Michgan's memory needs to
be short after this one. It should be anyway with
some of the hits the Crimson Tide dealt out.
Air Force (Sept. 8): Air Force ran all over Michi-
gan, but Denard Robinson returned the favor to
squeak out the 31-25 victory.
Massachusetts (Sept. 15): Easily Michigan's
weakest opponent in the midst of a grueling
schedule. Blowout alert in full effect.
Notre Dame (Sept. 22): May as well call this
showdown an instant classic before kickoff the
way this series has gone the past few seasons.
;4 Purdue (Oct. 6): The Boilermakers blasted
Eastern Kentucky in week one, and hope to give
Michigan a game in the Big Ten opener.
Illinois (Oct. 13): Michigan will miss Ron Zook,
who was fired after an 0-6 stretch to end last
season. But it might like Tim Beckman more.

S

Michigan State (Oct. 20): Wolverines could
snap a four-game losing streak to Sparty. If it
happens, avoid fans' (or players') raging fists at
all costs.
Nebraska (Oct. 27): Michigan handed the
Huskers a rude welcome to the Big Ten in 2011.
Prime time in Lincoln could be different, though.
Minnesota (Nov. 3): This game was a confi-
dence booster last year - a 58-0 drubbing. The
Little Brown Jug will stay in Ann Arbor again.
Northwestern (Nov. 10): In a late season
matchup, we'll find out who scraps harder: a
wildcat or a wolverine.
Iowa (Nov. 17): It's not heaven. It's Iowa - the
utterly mediocre squad that handed Michigan
one of its two losses in 2011.
Ohio State (Nov. 24): The reincarnation of the
Bo-Woody dynamic, Hoke and Meyer will com-
pete in 'The Game' for the first time at the Shoe.

him to be the keynote speak-
er to kick off his re-election
campaign at Crisler Arena.
Beckmann wasn't fol-
lowing in the footsteps of a
man - he was following an
established institution that
very suddenly wasn't there
anymore.
Six games after the trip
to Madison, Michigan was
home against Northwestern.
"I went up to go to-the pre-
game show with Bo that Fri-
day before the Northwestern
game, and when I got there
to the football office, Bo was
coming out of his office with
his coat and hat on, and he's
crying," Beckmann recalled.
"He said, 'We just lost Uf'
"It was probably the most
difficult game I ever had to
do ... It was a big loss for all
of us."
Beckmann never tried to
copy Ufer. He doesn't have
the horn, doesn't have the
farcical nicknames. He's
more of an 'Xs and Os' guy,
and he doesn't buddy up with
the team quite like the old
man did.
He doesn't sell insurance
to the whole coaching staff
either.
But for following a legend,
Beckmann has done a heck of
a job. It's been 31 years since
his first broadcast, and Beck-
mann has compiled quite the
repertoire of memorable calls

himself.
"There's one play in the
1997 National Champion-
ship year, and he made a call
on a Woodson play against
Ohio State in the final game,"
said Beckmann's partner
and color commentator Jim
Brandstatter. "He was stand-
ing up in the booth and he
was pointing at the field, and
he made a call that, for that
moment, for that play, it was
absolutely perfect.
"It was in his mind, his
body, his voice. I never said
a thing after he got done.
I stood there in the booth,
looked at him and applaud-
ed."
Most Michigan fans pick
Ufer's call of the 1979 Indi-
ana game as their favorite,
which is ironic because you
can't hear his voice for half of
it. At points, his screaming is
inaudible, and Patton's horn
is blaring too loudly.
But that was the point.
When the crowd went nuts,
Ufer didn't tell his audience
the crowd went nuts - Ufer
went nuts with them.
With the score tied at 21
apiece, six ticks on the clock
and the ball on the Hoosier
45-yard-line, Johnny "Win-
gin" Wangler zipped the ball
30 yards down the middle of
the field and hit Carter, who
skirted a couple of tackles on

his way to the goal line.
Ufer's reaction was both
immediate and captivating.
"You start to smile, from
the time Anthony catches
the ball, and you don't stop
smiling until Bob says there's
a break," said Brandstatter.
"And it's like a three-minute
long thing. His absolute and
complete joy and eupho-
ria over that play, and how
Michigan rescued a victory
from a tie - he brought all of
his considerable skills to bear
on that play."
As Schembechler ran out
onto the field to celebrate
the victory with his play-
ers, Ufer told his listeners,
"Bo Schembechler is look-
ing up at Fielding H. Yost in
football's Valhalla, and Bo
Schembechler says, 'Thank
you Fielding Yost! Thank you
Fielding Yost for that one!"'
Ufer may very well go
down in history as the first
and only sportscaster to
mention Valhalla - the
mythical hall where fallen
warriors who died in combat
would rest under the Norse
god Odin - in a play-by-play.
Now, as Ufer himself rests
a mere 20 feet from Yost in
Ann Arbor's ForestHill Cem-
etery, Michigan fans can look
up to football's Valhalla and
say, "Thank you Bob Ufer.
Thank you Bob Ufer for that
one'.,

The Michigan Marching Band spelled out Ufer's name in his honor at halftime on Oct. 17,1981 against Iowa, just 10 days before he passed. Ufer gave a speech and led the crowd in 'The Victors' over the PA.

The Michigan football team
will put Ron Kramer's No.
87 jersey back into circula-
tion prior to the Michigan-Mas-.
sachusetts matchup on Saturday,
designating Kramer as a'Michigan
Football Legend.'
Kramer, a three-sport athlete
from Girard, Kan., played offen-
sive and defensive end, running
back, quarterback, kicker and
receiver at Michigan in the mid-
1950s before a 10-year NFL career
at tight end with the Green Bay
Packers and Detroit Lions.
Kramer passed away on Sept. 11,
2010 at his home in Fenton, Mich.
He was 75.
His children, Kurt and Cassie,
and their families will be on hand
at Michigan Stadium on Saturday
for the on-field pregame ceremony
recognizing Kramer.
One of Kramer's grandchildren,
Kelsey, is an LSA senior at the
University. On Thursday, Kelsey
took a few minutes with the Daily
to remember her late grandfather,
a Michigan legend.
The Michigan Daily: What are
your emotions, what are your
family's emotions as your grand-
father's number is put back into
circulation this weekend?

Catholic? You bet I'd like it,"'

he honked that horn into the
microphone each time Mich-
igan scored for the rest of his
broadcasting career.
Before I leave Tom's
office - the same insur-
ance business his father
founded - he brings me into
his study, where 'his walls
and bookshelves are lined
with autographed Michigan
memorabilia. Photographs,
plaques, game balls - he
could probably sell half those
things on eBay and buy an
Audi.
W He reaches into a cabinet
and pulls out General Pat-
ton's horn. He squeezes the
bulbous end twice, likely jolt-
ing nearby employees who
have that 2:30 feeling on a
Monday. He doesn't care.
"Wanna try?" Tom asks.
I take the horn from his
hands, feel the rust and
squeeze it a few times.
I think about the families
across Michigan who gath-
ered in their living rooms
each fall Saturday and muted
the television to instead tune
into Ufer's broadcast. I think
of the 1979 Indiana game -
Johnny Wangler to Antho-
ny "The Human Torpedo"

Carter as time expired -
and imagine listening to the
incessant blaring of the horn
that followed.
I hand it back to Tom,
thank him and leave.
I'm not sure why, but I
can't stop smiling. More than
30 years after his death, Bob
still has that effect on people.
Last winter break, I was
at a buddy's house in New
Jersey for the Outback Bowl,
where I watched the host
mute Mike Tirico's play-by-
play before kickoff and plug
his iPod in the audio input.
I suppose the Rational
broadcasts are just too vanil-
la for a fidgety generation of
college football fans. Many
have spurned television and
radio commentary for Twit-
ter updates, where the analy-
sis from Sports Pickle is just
a tad edgier than the journal-
istic banter you hear during
the game.
Meanwhile, in Michigan,
CDs of Ufer's best calls still
fly off the shelves like a new
Madonna album.
On Saturdays, you can
hear the classics playing
throughspeakers as you walk
down a corridor of tailgates
in Ann Arbor.
Every Michigan fan has a
favorite Ufer call.
Local WTKA radio per-
sonality Sam Webb loves

playing "Touchdown Billy There isn't a Michigan Man
Taylor" on his broadcast, who wouldn't want to go out
from the 1971 Ohio State and scalp those Buckeyes
game. Taylor, Michigan's right now! They have the
running back, took the pitch audacity, the unmitigated
on the option 21 yards to the gall to tear down the coveted
house to defeat the Buckeyes 'M'"
10-7 in Ann Arbor, and Ufer Webb's radio show co-
went berserk. host, Ira Weintraub, calls in
"It fit rig ht i n with what
Bo was doing with the
Michigan footbal team
S'The Team, The Team,
The Team.' Bob Ufer
was a part of that, too."
- Frank Beckmann

Ufer he was a homer, he
would arrogantly reply, "You
bet Iam."
Ufer wasn't just a Michi-
gan fan - he was, in every
sense, a Michigan Man. In
1940, as a freshman at the
University, he played in the
same backfield as eventual
Heisman winner Tom Har-
mon before leaving the team
to run track.
Ufer later broke a number
of Michigan's track and field
recordsbefore he finished his
career.
"The biggest thing you
can do is go out and be you,"
Webb said. "That's what Bob
Ufer was on the radio. You
could tell that's him. I don't
think it was an act, I don't
think it was a character that
he played on the radio. That
was him.
"You feel like that's you, or
your friend, that's out there
calling the game. I think
there's an endearing aspect
to that."
In 1981, though, the voice
of Michigan football's radio
broadcast transitioned from a
beloved son of Ann Arbor to a
man that grew up in a Michi-
gan State household. The
play-by-play commentator
who succeeded Ufer, Frank
Beckmann, was raised on the
Spartansby his father.
But, like a fine scotch,
Beckmann matured, and he

grew an admiration for the
Wolverines. As the 1981 sea-
son opened at Wisconsin, he
would lead the broadcast,
and a sickly Ufer would take
the back seat in the press box,
relegated to the pregame
show and halftime reports.
"He was sick, he went on
the trip and he told me to
prepare as if I was doing the
game," Beckmann said. "We
got to Madison and I went to
his hotel room, and he imme-
diately says, 'You're doing
the game tomorrow.' He sat
there, very ill, and spent, I'd
say, two hours going over the
team, telling me about play-
ers.
"He wanted to make sure
Michigan football was well
represented on the radio. It
fit right in with what Bo was
doing with the Michigan
football team - 'The Team,
The Team, The Team.' Bob
Ufer was a part of that, too."
Of course, the transition
wasn't seamless. After 36
years, Ufer's voice wasn't just
a staple on the airwaves. It
rang through the locker room
to pump up the players, and it
permeated the campus dur-
ing pep rallies.
Schembechler brought
Ufer to speak to the players
the day before the 1981 Rose
Bowl to jack them up before
the game. Heck, in 1976,
President Gerald Ford called

full of life and always partying.
TMD: He played quite a long
time ago, but do remember him
getting recognized around games
pretty often?
KK: Definitely. A lot of people
that worked around Michigan
football definitely recognized
who Ron Kramer was. President
Mary Sue Coleman knew him very
well; I met her a couple times with
him. Kids my age might not unless
they're friends with me.
Two guys that lived next door
to me in my dorm found out that
he was a Michigan football player
and looked him up on Wikipedia.
He only is in the Hall of Fame for
the Green Bay Packers and played
for the Detroit Lions. They were so
mad at me for not telling them. But
my grandpa never talked about his
fame. He was just my grandpa to
me.
TMD: Do you remember any
memories he shared of his days as
a three-sport athlete?
KK: He would talk about Paul
Honorng - he played against him
at Notre Dame (and with him in
Green Bay), one of his really good
friends - and Tom Nowatski (a
teammate in Detroit). He used to
bring me out to lunch with him.
Football was his big thing, and
basketball he talked about occa-

sionally. We went to one game
together when they had an event
at Crisler Arena.
In track he was always told he
would be a really good shot putter,
and he obviously did well in it and
enjoyed it, but he loved football so
much more.
TMD: Sept.11,2010 isa day a lot
Michigan fans remember for the
good things - Denard Robinson
going for 502 yards against Notre
Dame - but obviously it was a dif-
ferent kind of day for you.
KK: I remember sitting in my
grandpa's house, and the coroners
were there. He didn't have his
cable hooked up for some reason,
so I asked his sister and my mom
if they would mind me turning
on the radio to listen to the game.
That was what he'd be doing any-
way and it was what I would be
doing. I wanted to get my mind off
of it and listen to Michigan foot-
ball.
I definitely will not forget
Denard Robinson running an
87-yard touchdown that day. That
is the one thing that's always stuck
in my mind about that day, think-
ing, 'My grandpa's probably sit-
ting up there laughing his ass off,
so happy thatwe won. It just felt
like he was there still, watching
the game as usual.

Webb also loves to imper-
sonate Ufer's disgust when
he saw the Buckeyes run out
of Michigan Stadium's tunnel
in 1973 and tear down the 'M'
Club banner - the banner
that the Wolverines jump up
to slap as they run out onto
the field before every game.
"And they're tearing down
Michigan's coveted 'M' Club
banner! They will meet a
dastardly fate here for that!

from the room next door:
"Don't forget about his poem
about truck drivers," in refer-
ence to the Ohio State sellout
crowd that Ufer claimed con-
sisted of 10,000 alumni and
74,000 truckers.
Few people seemed to
mind that Ufer was so bla-
tantly partial. His listeners
loved the in-your-face bias
because it came from some
place real. When critics told
