Astronomy professor Michael 

Meyer is at the forefront of the 
study of exoplanets — a field 
that explores planets orbiting 
stars outside the solar system. 
Recently, Meyer was part of a 
team which discovered a new 
planet.

After receiving his Ph.D. in 

astronomy from the University 
of Massachusetts and serving as 
a professor in the Department 
of Astronomy at the University 
of 
Arizona, 
Meyer 
worked 

as a professor of star and 
planet formation at the Swiss 
Federal Institute of Science 
and Technology, known as the 

ETH, in Zurich, Switzerland, 
from 2009 to 2016. He joined 
the University of Michigan 
faculty in fall 2016.

The 
ETH’s 
Institute 
of 

Astronomy was involved in an 
international consortium that 
built a device called Spectro-
Polarimetric 
High-Contrast 

Exoplanet Research instrument 
on the European Southern 
Observatory’s 
Very 
Large 

Telescope in Chile. The ESO 
is a research organization for 
major astronomy institutions 
in Europe; one of its most 
groundbreaking creations is the 
construction of four 8.2-meter 
telescopes.

“The instrument (SPHERE) 

is

The University of Michigan 

released 
its 
2017-18 
Annual 

Security Report & Annual Fire 
Safety Report this weekend, 
indicating an increase in the 
overall number of bias crimes 
reported to the University and 
Ann Arbor Police Departments 
since last year. Two intimidation 
incidents 
increased 
to 
nine 

incidents — which ranged from 
property destruction to physical 
assault — motivated by race, 
religion and identity bias.

Furthermore, 
the 
report 

also showed an increase in the 
number of sexual assault and 
harassment incidents reported 
to the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center. While 
sexual 
assault 
incidents 

increased marginally from 124 
cases reported to 125, incidents 
of sexual harassment jumped 
from 25 to 60 cases.

The University releases these 

statistics each year in accordance 
with the Clery Act, a federal 
statute that requires public and 
private universities to release 
crime statistics each year.

In an earlier interview with 

the Daily, University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
described 

plans for a website that will 
provide a detailed account of 
bias investigations. He noted 
the importance of remaining 
transparent 
while 
these 

investigations occur to maintain 
trust with students.

“I think one thing we are 

doing is trying to be more rapidly 
transparent about episodes that 
occur, so that everyone in the 
community knows where to 
look when they hear a rumor 
about 
something,” 
Schlissel 

said. “We’re putting up a website 
that gives basically a running 
summary of the events that 
happened, and the results of 
any investigations and practical 
things. I think that will at least 

help people know what’s going 
on.”

In 
an 
online 
statement 

released last week before the 
report, 
Eddie 
Washington 

Jr., executive director of the 
Department of Public Safety 
and Security, said DPSS officers 
work tirelessly to identify the 
perpetrators 
behind 
these 

crimes. He identified the Office 
of Student Conflict Resolution 
as an additional entity used 

to ensure students’ rights and 
responsibilities are upheld.

“We 
realize 
that 
recent 

incidents on and near campus 
have caused some members of 
our community to feel unsafe,” 
Washington 
wrote. 
“When 

crimes are reported, we always 
investigate each of the incidents. 
While sometimes investigations 
are not easily solved, we continue 
to look for new leads that can 
help identify perpetrators.”

President 
Donald 
Trump 

intends 
to 
nominate 

Michigan 
state 
Rep. 
Tim 

Kelly, R-Saginaw, to assistant 
secretary for career, technical 
and adult education in the 
Department 
of 
Education, 

according to The Detroit News. 
If confirmed, Kelly will leave 
his position as representative, 
which he has held since 2013.

In a May interview with The 

Detroit News, Kelly explained 
he shares certain beliefs with 
Education 
Secretary 
Betsy 

DeVos, including their support 
of school vouchers.

“We both believe in universal 

choice, but this (position) is 
more about trying to do what 
we can for kids, instead of 
loading them up with debt and 
pushing everybody into four-
year college degrees, maybe 
seeing what we can do for kids 
who might do well in technical 
training,” Kelly said to The 
Detroit News.

“So You Think You Can Dabke” event attracts 40 students to Union on Friday evening

“So You Think You Can Dance” 

made its way to Michigan this 
weekend, but this one had a new 
spin.

On Friday evening, TEDxUofM 

Adventures hosted its “So You 

Think You Can Dabke” event in 
the Michigan Union to celebrate 
and teach people about dabke 
— a traditional Arab folk dance 
performed at many weddings and 
other occasions. About 40 students 
attended the event that was co-run 
by Arabesque, a dance group on 
campus 
that 
practices 
Middle 

Eastern styles of dance.

LSA junior Hannah French, a 

TEDxUofM member explained the 
idea behind Adventures was to help 
people step outside their comfort 
zone, and learn about new cultures.

“Essentially an Adventure is 

an experiential event,” French 
said. “So we take members of the 
community and we put them into a 
space that they might not normally 

have the opportunity to be in-such 
as dabke, Arab folk dancing, or we 
may take them to a farm and let 
them experience why it’s like to try 
something new or live that lifestyle 
for a day.”

French also noted the main 

difference between a TED talk and 
an Adventure was the idea of first-

Positive messages covered the Diag
for ‘U’ Expect Respect initiative

The University plans to educate students on what respect means in new campaign

Positive messages covered 

the Diag on Friday, as the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

Expect 
Respect 
initiative 

launched its new campaign. 
The new campaign, which 
focuses on defining respect, 
was accompanied by booths 
that allowed students to better 
understand what respect means 
on campus. Approximately 600 
students participated in the 
event, which is the first of two 
“Diag Days” being held by the 
initiative.

Nicole Banks, the assistant 

dean of students, organized 
the event to help introduce 
students to the Expect Respect 
campaign and the values that 
it looks to instill in the student 

body.

“They hear the catchphrase, 

but they may not have had a 
deeper understanding of it,” 
Banks said, explaining the 
purpose of the event. 

To give students a better 

understanding, 
each 
booth 

focused on specific aspects of 
the campaigns led by Expect 
Respect.

One 
of 
the 
booths 

encouraged students to take 
a pledge to support the spirit 
of Expect Respect by signing 
a banner that will hang in the 
Diag.

Another 
booth 
focused 

on 
the 
First 
Amendment’s 

relation to free speech and 
hate speech on campus. The 
booth featured Doug Lewis, 
the director of student legal 
services on campus. While 
there, Lewis said, he engaged 

with students about how the 
First Amendment should be 
used 
to 
create 
meaningful 

discussion and not to inflame 
hatred against others. Lewis 
spoke of Expect Respect’s new 

poster campaign encouraging 
students to invite, not incite, 
hostilities when disagreeing 
with others.

“We 
had 
some 
rousing 

conversations 
about 
what 

that means in the light of 
what’s been going on here on 
campus lately,” he said.

The final booth covered 

Expect 
Respect’s 
newest 

campaign 
on 
defining 

respect. 
Students 
at 
the 

booth 
took 
photographs 

while 
holding 
dry-erase 

boards with messages about 
what respect means to them.

LSA senior Gabe Colman, 

who helped photograph and 
organize the event, handed 
out Expect Respect bracelets 
and stickers. Colman said the 
event and the encouragement 
of respect were important 
due to recent racist incidents 
on campus.

“Especially 
given 
the 

campus 
climate 
recently, 

we’re just trying to, you 
know, put all the love out 
there, as you can see with all 
the positive chalking around. 
We’re trying to, you know, 
drown out all the negativity 
and we’re trying to combat 
it with positivity and with 
respect.”

hand experience.

“When listening to a TED talk, 

you’re trying to live vicariously 
through the speaker, and you think 
about what their experience was 
like, but with an adventure you 
really get to live that life yourself,” 
French said.

The 
event 
began 
with 
an 

explanation of dabke’s origin and 
importance in Arab culture, and then 
participants had an opportunity to 
learn a choreographed dance taught 
by Arabesque choreographers — 
including LSA junior Maya Youness. 
The evening ended with a lively 
dabke free-style in which everyone 
had a chance to let loose, and have 
fun.

Youness reflected on the history 

of dabke, and explained how it began 
long ago with everyday workers and 
today has spread to the larger Arab 

community.

“Dabke started out a really long 

time ago with men that would be 
building roofs,” Youness said. “So 
they would be stopping to try to 
make it flat and smooth and it kind 
of took on a rhythm and became 
a dance and now everyone does it 
at weddings and celebrations and 
things like that.”

Youness has been dancing with 

Arabesque since her freshman year. 
She explained she joined because 
dabke combined two of her passions, 
and she stayed with the organization 
because it brought her friendship.

“I joined because I really like 

dancing and I really like Arabic 
music, so it was a good mix of the 
two, and now I’m in it because all of 
my best friends are in it,” Youness 
said.

LSA sophomore Hala Abbas 

came to the event with the hope of 
getting more involved with the Arab 
community on campus. She also 
talked about how TEDx Adventures 

is important on campus because of 
its ability to bring different groups 
of people together.

“They’re important to have on 

campus because they bring small 
communities on campus like ours, 
and people on the outside are able to 
see the things that we have to offer,” 
Abbas said. “I hope to see bigger 
turnouts in the future so that more 
people can we what we have as a 
culture.”

French shared these sentiments 

and explained it’s hard for some 
students to try something new, and 
hoped TEDx Adventures could help 
them do just that.

“There 
aren’t 
a 
lot 
of 

opportunities to really live an 
experience other than your own at 
U of M — not to speak for every other 
group that exists,” French said. “But 
I do think that’s a really cool thing 
that adventures offer is the chance 
to go somewhere that you would 
never be able to go without the help 
of an organization on campus.” 

camera that takes advantage of a 
technique called adaptive optics, 
whereby we try to measure the 
quality of the images that we 
get — say many times per second 
— and then we try to quantify 
the distortions in those images 
based on what we think an image 
without the Earth’s atmosphere 
in the way would look like,” 
Meyer said.

Then, the astronomers try 

to bend a deformable mirror 
many times per second, Meyer 
explained. 
Astronomers 
can 

adjust the shape of the mirror to 
take out distortions due to the 
Earth’s atmosphere.

“So, we try to build instruments 

on the ground that can take 
advantage of adaptive optics and 
give high-resolution images at 
the theoretical limit of the what 
the optics can give,” he said. 
“(SPHERE) is a fancy camera that 
takes advantage of that adaptive 
optics technique, and it takes the 
highest resolution images that 
one can obtain at the VLT from a 
single element telescope.”

Because of its involvement 

in the creation of SPHERE, the 
ETH’s institute was granted 
what’s called Guaranteed Time 
Observations — opportunities 
to use the device. It was here 
Meyer and other astronomers 
discovered the new exoplanet.

“You’re given, in our case, 

250 nights on the telescope … 
to exploit the instrument over a 
period of about five years, and we 
decided to reserve 200 of those 
nights for an exoplanet imaging 
survey called SHINE (Sphere 
Infrared survey for Exoplanets), 
and we’ve been working on that 
for about three years, and this is 
our first confirmed discovery of 
a planetary mass object around a 
normal star,” Meyer said.

Meyer said if he examines 

the ratio of the object — the 
discovered mass to the star mass 
— and compares it to the distance 
of the object to the star, the object 
is one of only a dozen or so that 
appear to be planetary mass that 
are close — but not too close — to 
their stars.

Currently there are thousands 

of known exoplanets as the 
field continues to grow. Meyer 
explained, 
however, 
the 

technique used to find this 
exoplanet is unique, and more 
direct, compared to others.

The radial velocity technique, 

or doppler spectroscopy, Meyer 
explained, uses a technique to 

measure the motion of the star in 
response to its associated planet. 
Astronomers would measure the 
velocity of the star and then infer 
a planet that would induce that 
kind of motion — an “indirect” 
way 
of 
inferring 
a 
planet, 

according to Meyer.

The transit technique is used 

when a planet passes between 
the astronomers on Earth and 
a distant star; the light from the 
star diminishes by a very small 
amount — producing an eclipse, 
or transit.

Meyer said the radial velocity 

technique has discovered many 
hundreds of planets, while the 
imaging technique that he and 
dozens of other astronomers have 
worked on found 12. However, he 
explained, many astronomers are 
wanting to use this technique to 
take pictures of planets.

“So we’re the up-and-coming 

technique, but it gets direct 
information,” Meyer said. “We 
measure the light from the planet 
directly and that allows us to 
estimate the luminosity of the 
planet and the temperature of 
the planet and to some extent we 
can estimate the composition of 
the atmospheres in the planet by 
taking spectra and analyzing the 
features of different molecules of 
the atmospheres of the planets; 
they gave rise to different dips 
and wiggles in the spectrum, and 
so we can try to constrain the 
compositions of the planets.”

The importance of Meyer’s 

discovery is multifold in the 
astronomy field. Though there 
are only eight planets in our solar 
system, Meyer explained, there 
are thousands of exoplanets.

“The goal, ultimately, is for us 

to compare the statistics of our 
discoveries of planetary systems 
around other stars with the 
architecture of our own known 
system,” Meyer said.

The newly discovered planet, 

Meyer said, is many times the 
mass of Jupiter and is farther 
from its star than Jupiter is 
from our sun. It is different from 
Jupiter but in the same class of 
planets of gas giant planets.

Meyer worked with several 

students and postdoctoral fellows 
in Europe, mentoring them in 
this project. However, Meyer said 
the work he did is related to the 
future work he is continuing at 
the University. He said his team 
has access to an adaptive optics 
system on a telescope of which 
the University is a special partner 
called the Magellan Observatory 
— also located in Chile.

“So we’re excited that this 

discovery happened, but we’re 

hoping to pursue very similar 
work with the adaptive optics 
cameras 
on 
the 
Magellan 

Observatory, 
which 
the 

(University) has preferred access 
to,” Meyer said.

Right now, Meyer said, he is 

working with a graduate student 
and 
postdoctoral 
fellows 
to 

interpret data from the Magellan 
Observatory. They are looking 
for gas giant planets like Jupiter 
around one of the nearest stars to 
the sun, Proxima Centauri.

“In the future, we hope to do 

even larger surveys with that 
facility and ultimately we would 
like to be involved in building the 
next generation of instruments 
for even larger telescopes, (like 
one) called the Giant Magellan 
Telescope — that’s a future 
facility plan for more than 10 
years from now that we would 
like to be involved with,” Meyer 
said.

Alexandra Greenbaum is a 

postdoctoral 
researcher 
who 

began working with Meyer in 
October 2016. Though she did 
not work with SPHERE, she 
works 
with 
the 
instrument 

Gemini Planet Imager, which, 
like SPHERE, is in the southern 
hemisphere in Chile; it is also used 
to provide images of extrasolar 
planets. She said the missions of 
teams using both instruments are 
similar, with their goals of doing 
a census of young stars, looking 
for big planets on wide orbits.

She said one of her roles at the 

University involves supporting 
preparations for James Webb 
Space Telescope observations; 
the James Webb Space Telescope 
is part of a NASA program, set to 
launch in spring 2019.

In 
an 
email 
interview, 

Greenbaum 
explained 
new 

astronomical 
discoveries 

contribute 
to 
a 
better 

understanding 
of 
the 
solar 

system.

“From a broad perspective, 

each discovery is a new piece 
of the puzzle in trying to 
understand how solar systems 
form and evolve,” Greenbaum 
wrote. “The results of big surveys 
tell us about the frequency and 
broad properties of planets in 
the range of the instrument’s 
sensitivity.”

She added that following single 

objects, with more than one 
instrument, helps astronomers 
understand smaller details.

Greenbaum 
explained 

different 
methods 
of 
planet 

detection 
provide 
different 

information and properties of 
planets. She said it is interesting 
to 
see 
how 
technological 

advances shape the field for the 
different methods and noted the 
imaging technique focuses on 
young planets, which are still hot 
and bright enough to be detected.

Greenbaum 
also 
echoed 

Meyer’s thoughts on the field 
of exoplanets, saying it was an 
incredible time to be an early-
career researcher in the field.

“I have always been very 

excited 
by 
technological 

advancement,” 
Greenbaum 

wrote. “Technology has made 
leaps and bounds since the first 
exoplanet 
discovery. 
While 

JWST, the largest infrared space 
telescope to date, is nearing 
launch, the community is already 
busy planning the next big space 
telescopes 
and 
working 
on 

concepts for future, even larger 
space 
observatories. 
Bigger, 

more sensitive telescopes bring 
us closer to imaging planets, like 
ones in our solar system, around 
the nearest stars. I’ve come into 
the field after over a decade of 
hard work to establish the latest 
suite of imaging instruments like 
SPHERE and GPI, and I get to be 
a part of the next generation.”

Felicity B. Hills, a Ph.D. 

student studying physics at the 
University, has a background in 
cosmology; she switched from 
working in a cosmology lab to 
working with Meyer because she 
wanted more of a background 
in computer science and data 
science.

Though 
she 
hasn’t 
been 

studying exoplanets for long, 
she emphasized the growing 
potential of the field. She said 
she vaguely remembers the first 
exoplanet was discovered when 
she was about 5 years old.

Hills said it is extremely 

valuable knowing how solar 
systems and planets formed to 
better understand how Earth 
formed. She said it is interesting 

to continue making discoveries in 
the field of exoplanets.

“For me it’s fascinating to really 

break down in understanding, 
what do we know and how do we 
know it,” Hills said. “They always 
say with cosmology or with astro, 
‘We can’t do experiments.’ But 
there’s only one universe and it 
only had one start time. When 
it comes to exoplanets we can 
keep finding planets and we can 
keep finding systems that are 
unlike anything we would have 
imagined. I think that’s really 
cool.”

Hills said it is exciting to 

discover and learn the details of 
planets through direct imaging; 
in the future, Hills would like to 
work on pushing such technology 
forward to discover smaller, 
dimmer planets around brighter 
stars.

Greenbaum and Hills have 

worked 
with 
the 
Magellan 

Observatory 
directly 
and 

continue to work with the data.

Hills said she and Greenbaum 

observed 
Proxima 
Centauri, 

around which an Earth-like 
planet was recently discovered 

orbiting. She explained that since 
then, 
follow-up 
observations 

were conducted to rule out the 
existence of a gas giant planet in 
the Proxima system. However, 
she said, it is possible this 
research missed the existence of 
a planet.

“We 
did 
a 
follow-up 

observation of Proxima to rule 
out the existence of a gas giant 
planet, and we’re still processing 
the data right now,” Hills said.

Meyer 
said 
students 
in 

astronomy and those who take 
interest in the subject can take 
a lot away from his and similar 
discoveries. He said astronomy is 
a very valuable tool for learning 
about the natural world and 
noted many people are interested 
in learning about life in the 
universe.

“Philosophically, 
that’s 

generally a topic people gravitate 
towards,” Meyer said. “A lot of 
students gain some insight into 
quantitative reasoning and look 
at the natural world differently 
and more quantitatively once 
they’ve 
studied 
science 
like 

astronomy in that context.”

ROBERT BUECHLER/Daily

A band plays at the Oktoberfest block party celebration hosted by the Ann Arbor Brewing 
Company in downtown Ann Arbor Saturday.

OK TOBE RFEST

$450 million in awards for 
biomedical research each year.

According 
to 
FFMI’s 

managing 
director, 
Connie 

Chang, though FFMI is based 
in the Medical School, its goal 
in encouraging research in 
the medical field extends to 
uniting academics and overall 
entrepreneurship.

“We 
like 
to 
think 
of 

innovation as something that for 
a long time was something that 
was to the side of what regular 
academia would think about,” 
Chang said. “But our mission is 
really to try to make innovation 
and entrepreneurship more of 
a natural academic behavior, 
even an expected behavior.”

FFMI 
executive 
director 

Kevin Ward, a professor of 

emergency medicine, echoed 
Chang’s 
statements 
and 

explained that while navigating 
the world of entrepreneurship 
may 
seem 
risky, 
FFMI 
is 

available to provide resources 
and advice to students about 
how to commercialize their 
ideas.

“Innovation 
and 

entrepreneurship 
are 
very 

risky, opposed to the traditional 
academic mission of getting 
your grants and writing your 
papers,” Ward said. “But at 
any point in their idea, their 
innovation roadmap, it can be 
something as early as a sketch 
on the back of a napkin or 
something really advanced, our 
program will have something 
to offer them to bring value and 
get them moving faster.”

Event host Daniel Orringer, 

an 
assistant 
professor 
of 

neurological surgery, explained 

how the process for creating a 
successful medical device starts 
with identifying an unmet need. 
Following panelists discussed 
how to take that idea from 
realizing a need for a device to 
producing that innovation and 
commercializing it.

Panelists 
highlighted 
the 

theme 
that 
medical 
device 

innovation 
involves 
more 

people than just those in the 
medical field. Creation of a 
device itself involves engineers 
and medical professionals. 

“A medical device if you think 

about it is one part engineering, 
it’s one part clinical,” Chang 
said. “You have to actually have 
a technology that’s going to 
actually create value or solve a 
problem that people care about, 
and those people are patients, 
and providers, and doctors, and 
nurses and so on.”

One 
such 
partnership 

representing a union between 
engineering and medicine is 
the teamwork of postdoctoral 

researcher Yang Liu and Jeff 
Plott, a doctoral candidate in 
mechanical engineering.

Liu and Plott created a device 

which quickly reaches brain 
clots and removes them without 
causing further complications. 
They submitted their medical 
device for the poster showcase 
and received first place.

Plott said the duo worked 

closely 
with 
doctors 
from 

Michigan Medicine to create 
this device. He elaborated that 
he enjoys using his engineering 
background 
to 
make 

innovations in the medical 
field.

“I like being able to put what 

we 
learned 
in 
engineering 

school to use to design products 
that directly help people,” Plott 
said.

His interest in combining 

engineering 
with 
medicine 

captures 
Chang’s 
point: 

medical 
device 
innovation 

involves more than just medical 
professionals.

Members of FFMI wanted 

to 
emphasize 
that 
beyond 

engineering 
and 
medicine, 

medical device innovation can 
capture many other interests. 
Organizers of the event hoped 
to unite multiple disciplines 
beyond the partnered schools 
to the University. 

FFMI emphasized how the 

event was intended for all 
members 
of 
the 
University 

community 
and 
how 
their 

work involves everyone from 
undergraduates 
who 
have 

bright ideas to senior faculty 
members who have started 
companies.

“The 
problems 
are 
so 

complex that no one person can 
solve them, so some of the most 
exciting technologies are these 
collaborations across schools 
and disciplines,” Ward said. 
“The language of innovation 
of entrepreneurship is sort of 
uniting.”

W

hen I was 14, my 
dad passed away 
from 
pancreatic 

cancer. 
It 
happened 
very 

quickly — he was diagnosed 
in 
February, 
placed 
into 

hospice in May and died in 
June — but I valued the time 
I had to prepare myself and 
to mourn. Even so, these 
months, and the months and 
years afterward, were some 
of the hardest times of my 
life. I often felt as if I couldn’t 
get through the day without 
thinking of my dad, and the 
fact that I was frequently 
pessimistic and bitter made 
it hard for me to relate to my 
peers.

So as an adult, I felt that I 

had already endured as much 
as I could mourning-wise and 
that the deaths and loss of 
anyone outside of my close 
friends and family would 
leave me sad, but not nearly 
as upset as when my dad had 
died. Believing this gave me a 
feeling of resilience, of grit, 
as if I were stronger than 
those around me because of 
what I had gone through. And 
then my dog passed away.

His name was Hercules 

and he was the best puppy 
in the whole world. I know, 
everyone says that about their 
dog, but only I’m honest when 
I say it (I’m kidding — kind 
of). He was a gentle dog who 
loved cuddling, was afraid of 
the vacuum and loud noises, 
and really only barked every 
once in a while. My family 
adopted him from the humane 
society when I was about 10 
years old. And even though 
he couldn’t talk and usually 

smelled bad, he was there 
for us during my dad’s death, 
my mom’s remarriage and 
my family moving out of my 
childhood home.

After I started college, he 

was one of the main reasons I 
looked forward to going home 
during breaks, and the reason 
I got so jealous of any other 
dog owner on campus. He 
was loyal, caring, sweet and 
a great friend. Admittedly, all 
dogs share these traits, but he 
was mine, you know?

So when he died, I didn’t 

realize just how upset I would 
be. I cried, I was angry, I had 
a hard time focusing on my 
school work — all traits I had 
exhibited after my dad had 
passed. Friends asked me if 
I wanted to talk about it and 
family members sent their 
condolences. What made it 
worse was that the vet found 
the tumor on Friday and he was 
gone by Saturday afternoon.

My mom, who had spent 

the most time with our dog 
and was possibly the most 
emotionally 
affected 
by 

Hercules’s 
death, 
had 
to 

make the decision on her own 
whether to put him down. 
Because of this, I wasn’t 
made aware of his death until 
after it had already happened, 
giving me no time to prepare 
myself for the mourning. It 
was rough and I was much 
more upset than I thought I 
was going to be.

You 
can’t 
control 
what 

saddens you or how you react 
to stressful situations. I’ll be 
the first to admit that losing a 
pet doesn’t even rank on the 
list of top tragedies a person 

can go through and that I’ve 
probably rolled my eyes before 
at people torn up at the loss of an 
animal companion. But for me, 
aside from being just my dog, 
Hercules was also a reminder of 
my dad and the times I was able 
to spend with him.

After we moved away from 

my hometown, he was a little 
piece of my childhood that 
came with us. This may sound 
selfish and cliche, but to me, 
Hercules was more than just a 
pet; he was also a connection 
to my past. Losing him feels as 
if I’m losing a part of myself, 
or a part of who I once was, 
and I didn’t realize this until 
he was already gone.

There’s 
nothing 
wrong 

with mourning the things that 
others might find frivolous, 
and there’s nothing wrong 
with mourning in the way that 
makes most sense to you. It’s 
pretty pointless to compare 
and contrast the pain in your 
life. For me to assume I’d be 
immune to being sad over the 
loss of a pet beacuse I had 
already witnessed the death 
of my dad was, as I now see, 
pretty naive.

So if I learned one lesson 

from this experience, it’s 
that toughness is overrated 
and you should always let 
yourself grieve. In the end, 
if something affects you in 
a negative way, you should 
always take time to deal with 
it. You can’t force yourself to 
not get upset over something, 
the same way you can’t teach 
an old dog new tricks.

I 

must confess: I am a 
perpetual procrastinator. 
I wait until the last minute 

to do absolutely everything. 
This piece was one of those 
things, but not just because I 
am lazy and easily distracted — 
the source for most of my usual 
procrastination. Writing this 
article was different. I knew 
exactly what I wanted to say, 
how I wanted to say it and the 
audience I hoped to reach for a 
week and a half now. Yet, I’ve 
sat on this piece, staring at a 
blank page and blinking cursor 
until my deadline today.

I am scared. My fear is the 

reason for my procrastination. 
This 
piece 
will 
focus 
on 

my reactions and thoughts 
regarding the racist events that 
transpired on campus during 
the past two weeks. I realize 
there have now been hundreds 
of opinions on the incidents 
on campus and throughout 
The Michigan Daily, on social 
media and in the news. I am 
scared that because of this, my 
opinion has become devalued.

Who 
wants 
to 
hear 

yet 
another 
Black 
person 

complain about how racist the 
University of Michigan has 
become, how tired they are 
and how hurt they feel? I feel 
as though my piece will just 
be lumped into this general 
narrative of “disgruntled Black 
people.” On the other hand, I 
fear my writing will promote 
this idea or label about my 
identity which includes words 
like “activist,” “political” or 
“radical.” These notions don’t 
just come from the public 
sphere. My mother tells me 
things like, “Who knew college 
would turn you into a Black 
Panther?” 
My 
sister 
says, 

“Can you maybe write about 
something not Black?”

That 
said, 
I 
am 
at 
a 

crossroads. Do I write and 
publish 
this, 
subsequently 

becoming just another angry 
Black 
woman? 
Or 
maybe 

portray myself as an activist, 
protester and social justice 
expert? Truth be told, I am 
not any of these things. I am 
Stephanie; I am a daughter, a 
sister, a student and a friend. 
But it just so happens that I 
am also Black. More important 

than that, I just so happen to be 
Black on this campus in 2017 
where I am told I am unwanted 
… an outsider … a problem … a 
nigger.

Notice my usage of the word 

here. I didn’t allude to it, or say 
“N-word.” Since it seems as 
though my peers and University 
community have become so 
comfortable seeing and using 
this word, there should be no 
uneasiness reading it here in 
my writing, right? There is a 
general sense of comfort in 
knowing that this is the way 
things are supposed to be. Why 
do we expect this? Why do we 
anticipate hate and violence 
from one another? People tell 
me things like, “Keep your 
head up” or, “Don’t pay them 
any mind” when these sorts of 
incidents happen.

Why 
has 
it 
become 

normalized 
to 
ignore 
and 

deflect? Why have we become 
comfortable? No one ever tells 
you how to sort these things 
out, how to respond to threats 
or how to protect your identity. 
Then, when you attempt to 
talk about it, these external 
and internal pressures push 
you into a binary. Are you an 
activist? Or are you an angry 
yet complacent bystander? It 
was while pondering these 
questions that I decided to 
write a letter to myself, my 
overeager high school senior 
self, that is. It was then that I 
wished I had someone to tell 
me what to expect throughout 
my college years.

Dear Stephanie,

2015 will be one of the 

hardest years that you have to 
endure. You will feel as though 

you don’t belong, you will want 
to go home. You will regret 
your decision to attend the 
University of Michigan.

In 2016, you are going to 

experience Islamophobia when 
you see #StopIslam written 
in the Diag. You will also see 
posters that label you and other 
members of your community 
as 
“dangerous,” 
“ignorant” 

and “unintelligent” by nature. 
You and other students of color 
will be threatened and taunted 
with 
violent 
messages 
on 

public University spaces.

In 2017, someone will urinate 

on a prayer rug in the library, 
emails will be sent out that 
threaten you and the lives of 
Jewish students, praise of the 
KKK and white supremacist 
sentiments 
will 
overwhelm 

you. Kendrick Lamar will drop 
one of your favorite albums of 
all time. Students will have 
racial slurs written on their 
dorm 
room 
doors. 
Racial 

slurs will be spray painted in 
downtown Ann Arbor. People 
will identify you and members 
of your community as niggers. 
Violence and protests will 
ensue.

A student will intend to 

kneel in the Diag for 24 hours 
to protest hate rhetoric on this 
campus. Not even 48 hours 
later, a man will urinate on 
printings of the words “Black 
Lives Matter” in the very spot 
where this student kneeled. 
You will feel shaken, disturbed, 
frightened and enraged. You 
will feel alone. People will tell 
you to ignore it. People will 
tell you that this is tragic, that 
things will blow over. None of 
the perpetrators of these hate 
crimes will be found, but you 
will be told to believe racism 
does not belong here by the 
University 
administration, 

including President Schlissel 
himself.

Are you uncomfortable?

You should be.

With love,

Stephanie

ust 
like 
most 
other 

20-year-old males, I, too, 
disrespected yoga. From 

the outside, how can anyone 
take it seriously? 
It 
appears 
as 

though 
you 
pay 

money to stand on 
a mat, stretch and 
meditate. Can’t you 
do that at home?

I’ve 
been 
an 

athlete my whole 
life. There’s no way 
I was going to stand 
in a room and bend 
over when I could 
run, lift weights, swim or do 
pretty much anything else. 
Yeah, I know that stretching 
is healthy, but dedicating an 
hour to contorting my body in 
odd shapes when I’m not even 
flexible seems excessive.

My parents have been doing 

yoga — specifically hot yoga 
— for 15 years. When I finally 
decided to accompany them 
to a class, purely to stop their 
constant pleas that I try it, 
I didn’t expect myself to get 
hooked. After going consistently 
for about a year and a half, 
I realize that yoga is widely 
misconceived and is associated 
with many unfair stereotypes. 
Though some are true, most are 
products of ignorance.

When I try to take people 

to a yoga class, they almost 
always say, “Thanks, but I’m 
not flexible.” You don’t need 
to be flexible to do yoga. As 
you become more advanced, a 
degree of flexibility becomes 
an 
eventual 
requirement, 

but everyone’s inflexible to 
some extent when starting 
out. In fact, in the beginning 
of one’s yoga journey, the 
biggest challenge isn’t even 
the stretching — it’s trying to 
survive.

The type of yoga I do — and 

the type you should do too 
if you want to have a truly 
humbling experience — is 
called “Hot Vinyasa.” It’s yoga 
on steroids. It’s fast-paced, 
physically 
demanding 
and 

hotter than the ninth circle 
of hell. It’s the true definition 
of a full-body workout. People 
who have never gone to yoga 

don’t realize that the 
greatest challenge of a 
class is the core work 
intertwined 
with 

balancing 
postures 

that 
make 
the 

deepest fibers of your 
muscles burn with 
incomprehensible 
pain.

At 
the 
end 
of 

class, you feel as if 
you’ve been reduced 

to nothing — as if you want 
to melt into the puddles 
of sweat that have already 
accumulated on your mat. In 
the morning, there are sore 
parts of your body that you 
never knew existed.

If 
you’re 
a 
guy, 

unfortunately, 
yoga 
isn’t 

going to make you “huge.” 
Instead, 
it 
lengthens 
the 

muscle to make you lean 
and toned. But it’s not the 
observable benefits that got 
me hooked to yoga, it’s the 
unobservable 
benefits 
that 

keep bringing me back.

Although 
Vinyasa 
is 

high 
intensity, 
there’s 
an 

underlying theme of trying 
to calm the mind and forget 
about the outside world. The 
heat is supposed to burn away 
worries, stress, anxiety, etc. 
Trust me, I know how cheesy 
it sounds because I was once 
in your position. But with 
experience, 
you 
learn 
it’s 

true. The classes are so hard 
and exhausting that at the 
end you don’t have the energy 
to worry about anything — 
and it’s extremely liberating.

Especially for a pre-med 

student like myself, yoga is a 
way to temporarily escape. At 
times when it’s felt as though 
I were going to lose my mind 
from constant pressures and 
workload, yoga has kept me 
sane. The teachers who lead 
the classes remind you to 
think positively and look at 

the big picture rather than 
let yourself be consumed by 
the smaller worries of life. 
It is therapeutic and helps to 
shift your outlook to a more 
positive perspective.

Don’t believe me? Well, 

according to various studies, 
yoga 
has 
been 
shown 
to 

enhance 
social 
well-being 

and improve symptoms of 
depression, attention deficit 
and sleep disorders. It also 
improves mood, awareness, 
mindfulness, etc. — the list 
goes on. From my personal 
experience, I can say with 
confidence that for students 
and professionals who are 
overly stressed, yoga is an 
underutilized tool. 

 Yoga has countless physical 

benefits in addition to mental 
benefits, increased strength 
and flexibility. For example, 
it helps reduce blood pressure 
and strengthens the immune 
system. Name a better way of 
surviving finals and flu season.

Doing yoga every day of 

the 
week 
isn’t 
necessary 

to begin experiencing the 
benefits. Going a couple of 
times a month is better than 
not going at all. Yoga can even 
complement other workout 
routines due to its ability 
to help with recovery and 
decrease chances of injury.

I know that some may be 

embarrassed by the idea of 
attending a yoga class, and I 
understand because I know 
the feeling. I thought I was 
going to be the only guy 
surrounded 
by 
girls 
with 

dreadlocks. Even though this 
proved to be false, I didn’t 
enjoy my first yoga class — but 
no one enjoys their first yoga 
class. It’s those who sum up 
the will to return who learn 
to 
disassociate 
yoga 
with 

ignorant misconceptions and 
appreciate the practice for 
what it truly is.

‘Transparent’ & the curse 
of the TV mid-series lull

AMAZON

‘Transparent’ is avaliable exclusively on Amazon

The popular Amazon show inevitably faces the hurdle of others

There comes a turning point 

in almost every great TV show 
where the writers and creators 
have to decide what’s next for 
their characters. The obvious 
path is to keep following the 
same track it started with, 
or occasionally, veer off into 
experimental 
territory 
with 

a new setting or additional 
supporting players. These paths, 
however, are not always met 
with the kindest responses from 
critics and fans. In fact, more 
often than not, these thematic 
continuations 
or 
alternative 

explorations induce the show 
into a “mid-series lull,” a period 
in which TV shows tend to falter 
after a hot streak of critical 
acclaim. 

This 
sneaky 
lull 
became 

apparent on the newest season 
of 
Amazon’s 
“Transparent.” 

Since its beginning in 2014, the 
Jill 
Soloway-created 
family 

dramedy has been a creative 
landmark 
in 
serialized 
TV 

storytelling. Not only does the 
show incorporate a diverse and 
talented ensemble cast, but it 
also shines with consistent and 
expansive character arcs. But 
because the immediacy of the 
streaming platform influences 
these arcs, the writers are 
forced to structure each season 
for a binge-watching crowd, a 
strategy that could either make 
the episodes feel too cramped or 
too bloated.

Unlike 
its 
first 
three 

incredible seasons, season four 
of “Transparent” feels like the 
show’s first major misstep. The 
show’s writing, acting, directing 

and cinematography remain as 
sharp as ever, but the lopsided 
plot structure has somewhat 
flattened the character arcs.

In 
season 
four, 
Maura 

(Jeffrey 
Tambor, 
“Arrested 

Development”) 
invites 
the 

Pfefferman clan to Israel for a 
mini vacation and also to reunite 
with her long-lost father Moshe 
(Jerry Adler, “A Most Violent 
Year”). At the same time, nebbish 
matriarch Shelly (Judith Light, 
“Ugly Betty”) sublimates a dark 
secret with an interest in improv 
comedy, a subplot that backfires 
in 
a 
melodramatic 
twist 

toward the end of the season. 
Schlubby Josh (Jay Duplass, 
“Room 104”) also confronts 
his childhood traumas, but his 
inner demon-fighting isn’t given 
the screen time it deserves. 
Sarah (Amy Landecker, “The 
Meddler”), the show’s least

TV NOTEBOOK

FOX SEARCHLIGHT PICTURES

Steve Carell and Emma Stone star in ‘Battle of the Sexes’

developed character, continues 
to make impulsive choices in 
her unconventional marriage. 
And Allie (Gabby Hoffmann, 
“Obvious Child”), the show’s 
most 
developed 
character, 

plays into the one-dimensional 
stereotype of the “social justice 
warrior” with her criticisms of 
Israel.

Instead of expanding the 

already 
immense 
emotional 

growth 
in 
its 
characters, 

this 
season’s 
emphasis 
on 

melodrama and politics simply 
reinforces 
each 
character’s 

regressive qualities. The show 
has always done an incredible 
job of exploring the richness 
of identity and the complexity 
of family history, specifically 
through the lens of Maura 
embracing her trans identity, 
but there is very little of that 
signature spark here.

Perhaps you could blame 

the 
experimentation 
of 

displacing the Pfeffermans in 
a new environment. Perhaps 
you can blame the inevitable 
comfortability that comes with 
writing the same characters 
going 
through 
the 
same 

obstacles. And perhaps you 
can blame the structure of 
the 
streaming 
platform 
for 

confining the writers to stick 

a formula that works only for a 
certain type of viewer.

Granted, 
there 
are 
some 

wholesome 
moments 
during 

this season — Maura’s struggle 
to reconnect with her father 
and her past self is the most 
emotionally 
stirring 
of 
the 

season’s subplots — and a 
welcome new character — the 
lovely Alia Shawkat (“Search 
Party”) 
plays 
a 
recovering 

sex addict who engages in a 
three-way 
relationship 
with 

Sarah and her husband Len 
(Rob 
Huebel, 
“Baywatch”). 

But what could have been a 
season that extracted more 
nuances from the Pfefferman’s 
family dynamics, and queer 
Jewish 
culture, 
given 
this 

season’s location, ends up being 
a muddled mess of contrived 
crises.

Of 
course, 
“Transparent” 

is not the first popular show 
that suffered from a mid-series 
rough patch, and it’s certainly 
not the last. CBS’s “How I Met 
Your 
Mother” 
disappointed 

devoted fans in its last few 
seasons, the final one being an 
overlong string of filler episodes. 
In the aftermath of its amazing 
third season, NBC’s “30 Rock” 
experienced a few tepid seasons 
before it recalibrated and found 

its mojo again. Fox’s “Glee” 
was especially hit early on with 
mixed to negative reception 
after its first two seasons. More 
recently, Netflix’s “Orange is the 
New Black” went through the 
mid-series lull, its fifth season’s 
three-day timeframe receiving 
an ambivalent reaction.

Sometimes, 
the 
risk 
of 

experimentation and repetition 
doesn’t have the greatest payoff. 
Even when a TV show is doing 
well, taking that risk may be a 
sign that TV writers are either 
getting stuck in a creative loop 
or feeling like their material 
isn’t compelling enough and 
therefore need to defy people’s 
expectations. 
At 
the 
same 

time, there isn’t an easy way to 
combat the lull. Every creative 
person goes through an artistic 
funk, whether it’s trying to 
break out of familiar patterns 
or having to constantly move 
your characters and ideas in 
new directions. A show like 
“Transparent,” however, has 
promise, even if its most recent 
season 
didn’t 
display 
the 

most remarkable of arcs and 
resolutions. But as long as TV 
shows such as “Transparent” 
keep moving forward, it’s only 
a matter of finding where to go 
and how to get there.

FILM REVIEW

Carell & Stone shine in the 
pertinent ‘Battle of Sexes’

In a historic tennis game, questions of equal rights are broached

In 1973, the entire population 

of “meninists” — an unfortunate 
population, 
indeed 
— 
have 

placed their bets on Bobby 
Riggs, retired tennis superstar, 
to prove to humanity that men 
are superior to women. Riggs 
must beat Billie Jean King, the 
world’s best female tennis player, 
to end the dispute and silence 
“libbers” for good. On Sept. 20, 
the two faced off at the Houston 
Astrodome in one of the most 
watched tennis matches of all 
time. And for the goodness of 
humanity, Riggs was humiliated.

The victory itself, however, 

is the least liberating part for 
King; it was one stepping stone 
in her path to self-discovery and 
liberation.

“Battle of the Sexes” is an 

atypical historical sports movie. 
The match itself — something 
that would normally be the 
end goal and most captivating 
moment — is really just the 
culmination 
of 
King’s 
fight 

for equal pay. Unlike “Rocky” 
or 
“Rudy,” 
intense 
training 

sequences are replaced with King 
fighting for equality in an uphill 
battle against a sexist USTA 
administration. Simon Beaufoy’s 
(“Slumdog Millionaire”) tight 
screenplay captures the lives of 
King and Briggs and what led to 
their trivial yet historic match.

King, perfectly portrayed by 

Emma Stone (“La La Land”), 
boycotts the USTA after she’s 
paid an eighth the amount of 
her 
male 
counterparts. 
She 

then goes on a tour organized 
by 
Gladys 
Heldman 
(Sarah 

Silverman, “Wreck it Ralph”), 

founder 
of 
World 
Tennis 

Magazine, 
featuring 
other 

women tennis stars joining her 
efforts. For Riggs (Steve Carell, 
“Foxcatcher”), 
a 
pervasive 

gambling 
addiction 
and 

crumbling 
marriage 
catalyze 

his return to the public eye. 
He was akin to fellow tennis 
showman John McEnroe, with 
less 
emphasis 
on 
courtside 

outbursts and more on his 
eccentric demeanor and knack 
for self promotion. Although 
the match itself 
is only a fraction 
of 
the 
movie, 

King and Riggs 
are perfect foils: 
her 
poise 
and 

grace 
contrasts 

his 
bombastic 

eccentrics.

Both 
Stone 

and 
Carell’s 

performances 
are 
dead-on 

replications. 
Every 
moment 

feels 
like 
you’re 
watching 

King and Riggs brought back 
to their respective ages in a 
time machine. From Riggs’s 
idiosyncrasies 
to 
King’s 

confidence, both actors deliver 
performances that stand out as 
some of their best. Carell has 
grown from a sitcom all-star 
to an actor that can mold — 
quite literally — into any role. 
His last several performances 
include 
face 
prosthetics 
so 

realistic it feels like you aren’t 
even watching the same man 
who once played Michael Scott 
on “The Office.” But it’s Stone’s 
potent onscreen performance 
that transcends “Battle of the 
Sexes” from being just another 
inspirational flick to a socially 

conscious, gripping tale.

Stone’s 
subtle 
facial 

expressions and gestures hinting 
at her newfound love for her 
hairdresser Marilyn (Andrea 
Riseborough, “Birdman”) stand 
out as the movie’s best moments. 
We forget the purpose of the tour 
— obtaining equal pay — and are 
immediately drawn into their 
relationship. Directors Jonathan 
Dayton and Valerie Faris (“Little 
Miss 
Sunshine”) 
effortlessly 

show the controversy and beauty 

in the character’s 
affection; subtlety 
replaces grandiose 
cheesiness, though 
the movie walks a 
fine line between 
melodrama 
and 

camp.

“Battle of the 

Sexes” ambitiously 
takes on two huge 
tasks: 
LGBTQ 

rights and equal 
pay. Dayton and 
Faris 
succeed 

at representing both, but it 
ultimately feels like the two sides 
are missing key elements. The 
battle for equal pay, something 
that easily could be the sole 
plot, takes a backseat to King’s 
relationship 
with 
Marilyn. 

Then, as we’re drawn into it, 
the plot shifts to the King-Riggs 
match. Although the story is 
based on reality, going back-and-
forth between two incredibly 
important themes is a lofty goal, 
one that isn’t quite met.

Regardless, King’s story is a 

triumphant display of bravery, 
and after over forty years, it 
needed to be told. In a genre 
where women don’t get equal 
representation, “Battle of the 
Sexes” is a clear progression.

Manchester brings emo

Before they took the stage, I 

had practically no clue what the 
Manchester Orchestra sound 
was. I vividly remember seeing 
Foxing and Tigers Jaw — two 
of my favorites — announced 
as openers for this tour, hitting 
stages I never even dreamed 
they’d reach when I was 16. 
Yet, by Manchester Orchestra’s 
moniker, I assumed they were a 
plain-Jane indie outfit. I could 
not have been more wrong.

After I was knocked on my 

ass by Manchester Orchestra’s 
performance, the brilliance in 
their choice of tour-mates hit 
me like a truck.

Foxing’s 
elaborate 

compositions 
and 
powerful 

presence set the mood at the 
Fillmore in Detroit. They’re 
a band that is really hard 
to ignore just by the sheer 
force of their music, and even 
though the stage was far larger 
than any I’d seen them play 
on, frontman Conor Murphy 
demanded attention with his 
soaring vocals and occasional 
trumpeting. 
The 
beautiful 

band even did us the service 
of playing a brand new song 
off their forthcoming record, 
which showed promise.

Next came indie rock outfit 

Tigers Jaw. Fresh off the release 
of their album spin this year, 
the band played a surprisingly 
lengthy set, full of new songs 
with a sprinkling of classics. 
Singles like “Guardian” and 
“June” from this year’s release 
still hold up as some of the most 
solid of the year, while “The 
Sun” and “Chemicals” have 
remained staples in their sets 
for a while now. Truthfully, 
I 
think 
everyone 
on 
this 

planet should be seeing and 
hearing Tigers Jaw, and their 
performance last Wednesday 
only reaffirmed my devotion. 
Their mix of an emo sensibility 
and commercial accessibility 
of wonderfully composed indie 
punk rock make them all too 
easy to fall in love with.

Manchester 
Orchestra 

proceeded to rip through a 17 
track set, each new song pulling 
myself and the crowd into a 
deeper understanding of their 
gorgeous music — a vast, diverse 
hybridization of intimacy and 
raucousness. After frontman 
Andy Hull started passionately 
screaming on the chorus of the 
fourth song “Shake It Out,” I 
was hooked.

Touring in support of 2017’s 

atmospheric, 
moody 
release 

A Black Mile To The Surface, 
new material composed a little 

under half of their set. They 
sprinkled in crowd pleasers like 
“I’ve Got Friends” and “The 
River,” 
producing 
mirrored 

passion in a crowd that yelled 
every word back at the band 
— 
passion 
indicative 
of 
a 

typical emo and punk show. It 
dawned on me, suddenly, that 
Manchester Orchestra is an 
emo band, despite their indie 
associations.

It was on this basis, this 

foundation 
of 
talent, 
that 

Manchester Orchestra and their 
tour mates succeeded in moving 
an entire room of people (those 
smart enough to have ended 
up at the Fillmore, instead of 
the poor souls down the street 
watching 
America’s 
favorite 

panderer of mediocre folk pop, 
Ed Sheeran). By perfecting their 
loud-soft dynamic, Hull and 
company crashed wave after 
wave of emotion down on the 
crowd with the help of vocals 
ranging from tender croons to 
piercing yells, booming riffs 
and elegant piano melodies. The 
sheer versatility of the band’s 
musicianship is as incredible a 
spectacle to see as it is to hear. In 
the span of an hour, Manchester 
Orchestra turned me from a 
bastard hipster showing up for 
the lesser known openers into a 
rabid fan, an accomplishment as 
rare as a solar eclipse.

Laura Lee on the dispute 
over Oscar Wilde’s legacy

Talk with the author of a new book on Wilde & ghosts he left behind

Over a century after his 

death, Oscar Wilde is still a 
contentious character. Many 
are familiar with at least 
some snippets of his life story, 
if not the whole thing: his 
impassioned personality, his 
fame and success, his trial 
and imprisonment for gross 
indecency 
with 
men 
and 

his death only a few years 
afterward.

As if it weren’t enough 

for 
controversy 
to 
follow 

Wilde throughout his life, 
it continued even after his 
death. This took the form 
of a bitter conflict between 
Wilde’s lover, Lord Alfred 
Douglas, 
and 
his 
literary 

executor, Robert Ross.

Laura 
Lee’s 
new 
book, 

“Oscar’s Ghost: The Battle for 
Oscar Wilde’s Legacy,” deals 
with this conflict and with the 
enormous fallout of Wilde’s 
death.

“It actually started when 

I got a Kindle for the first 
time,” Lee said. “I was looking 
for something to download 
that was free and I chose De 
Profundis, Oscar Wilde’s long 
essay that he wrote in prison 
in the form of a letter to Lord 
Alfred Douglas.”

This prompted Lee to start 

investigating 
more 
of 
the 

work that Wilde and Douglas 
had written about each other, 
which spurred her onward and 
opened up more questions.

“I found that everything 

that had been written was 
kind of arguing from the point 
of view of one of these guys or 
the other. And I wanted to see 
what the context was and be 
sympathetic to all of them, but 
figure out what I could about 

what the truth was,” Lee said.

That was six years ago. 

Now the book is complete, and 
Lee has gained a much fuller 
picture of what motivated 
both Douglas and Ross as they 
sparred in the years following 
Wilde’s death, battling over 
whether the death should be 
blamed on Wilde’s circle of 
friends and admirers or on 
Douglas alone.

“[Wilde] was an aggressive 

man, he inspired them both,” 
Lee said. “They were both 

quite a bit younger than him, 
and he talked about art and 
made them feel like they were 
part of a community, part of 
something that was forward-
looking and exciting instead 
of being on the margins. So 
I think that they were both 
very devoted to him, and they 
both felt, in different ways, 
responsible for parts of what 
had happened to him ... I think 
a lot of their feud was not 
wanting to be blamed for what 

happened.”

It was a complicated battle, 

in part because people are 
complicated 
and 
because 

it was hard to put Wilde’s 
decline in health in black 
and white terms. There is 
no question that Ross and 
Douglas both cared for Wilde, 
but it is interesting to note 
the ways in which Douglas 
has been increasingly blamed 
for Wilde’s misfortunes in 
the years following his death, 
in large part due to Ross’s 
writings.

“[Ross] really framed our 

dialogue about Oscar Wilde,” 
Lee said. “But interestingly, 
Lord Alfred Douglas, later in 
his life, even though he had 
no warm feelings for Robert 
Ross, he even said that that 
mythologizing of Oscar Wilde 
was a necessary first step to 
preserving his legacy.”

In the end, it seems that the 

point is less to declare a true 
and definite winner, and more 
to examine the interesting 
manifestations of this conflict.

“I 
don’t 
think 
there 

were 
winners 
and 
losers, 

necessarily,” Lee said. “I think 
that grand mythology about 
Oscar Wilde is part of what 
made him so intriguing, and 
such an enduring figure. So 
I’m sympathetic to both of the 
men in the battle, I understand 
both of their motivations. I 
try to see them as much as 
possible on their own terms, 
and with empathy.”

Lee’s book will be available 

for purchase in the United 
States starting on November 
1. She will speak at the Ann 
Arbor 
District 
Library 
on 

October 17 at 7:00 p.m.

Michigan 10, Western Ontario 1

RYAN MCLOUGHLIN/Daily

Sophomore defenseman Luke 

Martin 
and 
senior 
forward 

Dexter Dancs helped fans at 
Yost Ice Arena let out a sigh of 
relief with a first period, power 
play goal that slipped past the 
opposing goaltender.

On a heavily-anticipated Friday 

evening, the Michigan hockey 
team took on Western Ontario 
in the first exhibition match of 
the season. Following a season of 
disappointment last year — but 
paired with high expectations for 
this year’s team under new coach 
Mel Pearson — one could notice 
that every member of the crowd 
was on the edge of their seats.

One of the most distinguishing 

— and surprising — traits of the 

exhibition match was a newfound 
offensive initiative.

“The goal scoring,” Pearson 

said. “We were 42nd in offense 
last year, so we weren’t sure 
where the goals were going to 
come from.”

The Wolverines, who failed to 

score over six goals in a single game 
last year, proved that nervousness 
futile in a 10-1 win that can only be 
described as a one-sided offensive 
pandemonium.

Michigan took its new ethos 

of an unwavering, fast-paced 
offense to heart with two goals 
early in the first period. After 
Dancs’ deflection goal off Martin’s 
shot just over four minutes into 
play, Michigan did not hesitate to 
pick apart the Mustang defense, 
unleashing 15 shots on goal in the 
first period.

After 
a 
successful 

counterattack 
just 
over 
nine 

minutes in, junior forward Cooper 
Marody carried the puck down 
the right side of the ice, delivered 
a crisp pass to Dancs under the 
goal, who, in robotic precision, 
passed to senior forward Tony 
Calderone for a one-timer.

“I know where Tony is on the 

ice. I’ve played with him the last 
two or three years,” Dancs said. “ 
… I know where he likes to be and 
that’s the high slot.”

Western Ontario’s frustrations 

with the unrelenting Wolverine 
offense came to fruition when 
Mitchell 
Brooks 
ripped 
the 

helmet off Martin, resulting in 
an immediate ejection from the 
game and a five-minute major 
penalty.

The Wolverines entered the 

locker room up on Western 
Ontario, 2-0, leaving no spectator 
in doubt that the era under 
Pearson looks promising.

The second period started 

much like the first, with the 
Wolverines dominating the shot 
count and possession.

Five minutes into resuming 

play, 
though, 
the 
Mustangs 

seemingly found a new leg to 
stand on, with two breakaway 
opportunities. 
Sophomore 

goaltender 
Jack 
LaFontaine 

thwarted both chances – the 
latter being a sweeping glove save 
meant for a highlight reel.

Michigan quickly settled in 

once again, netting its third goal 
on a dish from senior defenseman 
Cutler Martin down in front 
of the net to fifth-year senior 
forward Alex Roos, who finished 

the job.

But they didn’t stop there.
Following a brawl behind the 

Western Ontario net, sophomore 
forward Will Lockwood deked 
the Mustangs’ goaltender, Luke 
Peressini, on a penalty shot to put 
the Wolverines up by four.

From there, Michigan exerted 

its dominance, as the Wolverines 
let 27 shots fly resulting in two 
more goals.

Marody kicked off the third 

period in similar fashion to the 
first and second after just 53 
seconds when he seamlessly 
netted a cross-ice pass. Martin 
and sophomore forward Jake 
Slaker followed up on the trend 
with two goals of their own.

After 
Trevor 
Warnaar 

became the Mustangs’ second 
ejection — leaving the stadium 

for 
misconduct 
—Western 

Ontario’s chances even for a 
pride-saving comeback seemed 
dim. Immediately following the 
ejection, 
sophomore 
forward 

James Sanchez deflected a shot 
past Peressini for the teams 10th 
goal.

“Starting off the year like that,” 

Calderone said. “It shows the 
work that we did in the summer is 
paying off a little bit.”

In a last--chance effort to avoid 

the shutout, center Ray Huether 
put in the Mustangs’ first goal off a 
scrum in front of the net, limiting 
the Wolverines’ lead to nine.

Nine 
different 
Michigan 

players found the net in a 
statement that the new fast-paced, 
eclectic and gritty Wolverines are 
taking steps to reverse last year’s 
storyline.

A love-hate relationship

I

’ve loved sports since 
before I can remember, and 
the one sport I’ve always 

loved most is soccer. 

When I was one, my parents 

took me to a professional 
photographer for family 
portraits. 
They sat 
me down in 
front of the 
camera for 
an individual 
shot, but 
I started 
crying as 
soon as they 
walked away. 
No matter 
what toys 
they tried to give me, I just 
wouldn’t stop.

Then my dad, who played 

soccer in his youth back in 
Ethiopia, handed me a soccer 
ball. It worked like a charm. 
From the smile spread wide 
across my face to the ball held 
softly between my hands, the 
photo captured the pure joy of a 
child falling in love. I still have 
it framed in my bedroom.

With the current climate 

surrounding sports, every time 
I look at it, it feels like a double-
edged sword.

After last Sunday’s show of 

solidarity among NFL players, 
the president tweeted that the 
issue of kneeling has “nothing 
to do with race.” But the outrage 
expressed toward those who 
chose to take a knee showed 
that isn’t the case.

The people voicing their 

opposition on Twitter claimed 
that they would stop watching 
the NFL and listening to sports 
radio because, when faced 
with a choice between their 
country and their favorite 
sport, they chose their country 
automatically.

The country they are 

referring to — the one that 
frequently claims to be the 

greatest nation in the world — 
makes that case based on its 
position as a global bastion of 
democracy. The U.S. may have 
been founded on the ideals of 
liberty, equality and justice for 
all, but these protests highlight 
the fact that those ideals have 
remained more idealized than 
actualized.

A democracy requires that 

the human rights of all citizens 
are protected. When certain 
minority groups face systematic 
oppression as part of their daily 
life — within the realm of sports 
and far beyond — that simply 
isn’t the case.

A democracy also requires its 

citizens to be active participants 
in civic life. The argument that 
there should be a separation of 
sports and politics doesn’t fit 

within the fabric of our country.

Sports are a luxury for some, 

but they are a harsh reality for 
others. For those who think 
sports are only a product 
put out by a league filled to 
the brim with owners who 
have more money than they 
could ever need, sports are 
easily dispensable from their 
daily routine. But for those 
whose lives depend upon the 
paychecks they earn playing 
a game, they are worth much 
more than money could convey.

No one can deny that the 

adoration of sports has created 
a dangerous culture in our 
society. But these NFL fans 
have turned a blind eye to 
concussions, domestic abuse 
and sexual assault, and yet, 
kneeling during the national 

anthem is what made them give 
up their fanhood.

After playing organized 

soccer from the ages of four to 
nine, I transitioned to watching 
sports. It all began with the 
World Cup, a shining example of 
the communal power of sports. 
The World Cup brings athletes 
from across the globe together 
to represent their countries on 
the field of play, and ultimately, 
crowns a single country the 
champion of the world.

On the surface, it would 

seem to be a match of division 
waiting to be lit. But in reality, 
the World Cup carries a torch 
of unity. 

After soccer, basketball and 

football became my favorite 
sports, and I started to follow 
them regularly. The other two 

major U.S. sports, baseball 
and hockey, didn’t capture my 
interest nearly as much.

For a child growing up 

in the Metro Detroit area, 
that might seem somewhat 
counterintuitive. The Red 
Wings and Tigers were the class 
of the city during my youth. In 
2006, the Tigers made it to the 
World Series for the first time 
since 1984, and I didn’t watch 
a single game. In 2008, the Red 
Wings won the Stanley Cup for 
the fourth time in 12 seasons, 
and I never even stepped foot 
inside Joe Louis Arena. 

When you’re a child, you 

don’t think much of it. But then 
you grow up and you start to 
see the flaws that permeate 
the sports landscape. You start 
to understand the underlying 

differences between the sports 
you love and the ones you don’t 
love as much.

Out of the four major leagues, 

the NBA and NFL are majority 
Black, while the MLB and 
NHL are majority White. I now 
realize that I gravitated toward 
the first two as a child because 
when I saw those players, I saw 
a piece of myself. That extends 
to their actions outside the field 
of play as well.

When I saw NBA players don 

all-black hoodies in memory of 
Trayvon Martin and ‘I Can’t 
Breathe’ shirts in memory of 
Eric Garner, I understood that 
they had a personal stake in 
the fight for justice. When I 
heard the Pittsburgh Penguins 
announce their decision to 
visit the White House in 
commemoration of their 
championship, I understood 
that they didn’t feel the need to 
play a role in that fight.

Making a stand against 

social inequality shouldn’t be 
a burden left to those who face 
the consequences. Silence is a 
luxury afforded to those whose 
lives are not in the line of fire. 
Our society has tried to ignore 
that reality, but these times are 
too important to remain silent.

When I look at the picture of 

myself holding a soccer ball, I 
realize the beauty of sports that 
people talk about. I didn’t know 
anything yet about camaraderie, 
competition, or community — 
the buzzwords people often use 
to describe the purity of their 
passion. When you’re a child, 
you don’t need a reason; you just 
need a feeling.

I’ve loved sports since 

before I can remember, but it is 
growing harder to accept the 
realities that come with the 
territory.

FIELD HOCKEY
‘M’ drops Terps for
first time since 2001

With a free hit outside the 

circle and 10 seconds on the 
clock, the No. 6 Michigan field 
hockey team had one last chance 
to knock off No. 15 Maryland. The 
score was knotted at two and it 
appeared double overtime wasn’t 
going to be enough to decide the 
game. Neither team could break 
through for the game-winning 
goal until junior forward Emma 
Way finally saw the ball roll 
through the goalkeeper’s legs.

Way took advantage of a scrum 

in front of the net, and dove for 
the ball to knock it in with one 
second remaining. Not only had 
she scored the game-winning 
goal, but she also led her team to 
a 3-2 victory over the Terrapins 
(2-2 Big Ten, 6-5 overall) — the 
Wolverines’ (4-0, 8-2) first win 
over Maryland since their 2001 
NCAA Championship.

“It’s been a while since we’ve 

beaten Maryland,” said Michigan 
coach Marcia Pankratz. “They’re 
an excellent team, they’re well 
coached and we have a lot of 
respect for them. So that’s why 
it’s really sweet to have a big 
victory over them tonight.”

The Wolverines took control 

of the game from the beginning. 
Just a minute into the game, 
fifth-year senior forward Carly 
Bennett 
saw 
the 
Terrapin 

goalkeeper come off her line. She 
took advantage of the commotion 
in the circle for the first goal of 
the game.

“I think it was a really 

important goal,” Pankratz said. 
“We’re coming off a big win 
last weekend, so scoring first 
really helped to continue that 
momentum.”

While the first goal had 

Bennett in the right place at the 
right time, Michigan’s second 
goal was as if it was drawn 
straight from a playbook. The 

Wolverines earned a corner and 
executed the play perfectly. Way 
sent the ball to senior midfielder 
Katie Trombetta, who lined up 
like she was taking the shot, but 
purposely sent it wide where 
freshman defender Hallie O’Neill 
redirected it into the net.

The two-goal lead didn’t last 

for long, though, as Terrapin 
midfielder 
Lein 
Holsboer 

charged the circle and scored 
from the left side just over five 
minutes later.

Maintaining the lead wasn’t 

easy for the Wolverines. Once 
Maryland saw the game-tying 
goal in sight, it packed on the 
pressure. 
Senior 
goalkeeper 

Sam Swenson made plenty of 
saves 
throughout 
the 
night, 

but with under 10 minutes left 
in 
regulation 
the 
Terrapins 

evened the score. There was 
nothing Swenson could do, as the 
Maryland forward took the ball 
out wide and reverse chipped it 
to hit off the post and fall in.

While 
the 
Wolverines 

controlled 
overtime 
by 

maintaining 
possession, 
the 

Terrapins made the most of 
their limited touches. Maryland 
took advantage of any mishap 
Michigan made, including when 
the 
Wolverines 
botched 
the 

corner and allowed the ball to roll 
to the halfway line for Maryland 
to scoop up for a breakaway with 
a chance to upset the Wolverines. 
Fortunately for Michigan, the 
Terrapins had to get passed 
Trombetta, who knocked the 
ball away in time for her team to 
recover.

While Way scored the game-

winning goal, it was the defense 
from Trombetta that truly won 
the Wolverines the game.

“She was a warrior today,” 

Pankratz 
said. 
“She 
is 
the 

senior leader of our team in that 
defensive back field. Her one-on-
one defense was stellar, it was 
All-American material.”

Michigan opens season with win over Oakland

For 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

swimming and diving team, the 
name of the game is redemption. 

Even in the Wolverines’ first meet 

of the year – a dual meet against 
non-conference opponent Oakland 
– the biggest thing on their minds 
was how to rebound from their 
disappointing second-place finish at 
last year’s Big Ten Championships 
after previously winning the title 
seven years in a row.

Friday’s meet was a good start. 

Michigan made a splash, winning 
the meet by a score of 203-91. Nine 
different swimmers and divers 
claimed wins across 13 individual 
events, and the Wolverines won both 
relays: the 400-yard medley and the 
200-yard freestyle. Michigan coach 
Mike Bottom saw it as a positive sign 
for the program.

“It shows the depth of that team,” 

Bottom said.

Though the team was tired from 

training hard all week, it didn’t let 
that stop it from taking down the 
Golden Grizzlies.

“We didn’t rest at all for this meet 

… so it was really cool to see everyone 
swim really fast and post some first-
place finishes,” said sophomore 
Jacob Montague.

Montague was one of the 

swimmers that stood out Friday. An 
All-Big Ten second-team selection 
last season, he won the 100- and 
200-yard breaststroke and was part 
of the winning 400-yard medley 
relay team.

Another 
standout 
was 

sophomore Felix Auböck. Auböck, 
who was named Big Ten Swimmer 
of the Year last year as a freshman, 
won the 500- and 1000-yard 
freestyle races, winning the former 
by nearly 15 seconds with a time of 
4:26.43.

In the 200-yard freestyle relay, 

Michigan entered six teams. One 
of them took first, but the other five 

were disqualified for false starts. 
That’s something the Wolverines 
need to improve on, but Bottom 
noted that it’s all about finding 
a balance between getting fast, 
aggressive starts while avoiding 
early jumps.

“They’re starting to feel free 

to push their starts,” Bottom said. 
“They’ve been timid in the past 
because if you disqualify a relay, 
there’s a lot of points lost.”

He believes the team will show 

improvement as the season goes on.

“(Pushing their starts) here will 

help them to do it at the end of the 
season.”

On the diving side, sophomore 

Jake Herremans won the one-meter 
event with a total score of 351.6 while 
freshman Ross Todd took first in the 
three-meter with a score of 369.15. 
Though the divers are just starting 
to put together their sets, Bottom 
believes there is plenty to like.

“Our divers did as best as they 

could (at Big Tens last year) but we 

didn’t have the personnel. This year 
we have a great personnel,” Bottom 
said. “I think that we’ll be a little 
more competitive.”

Todd, a member of the Australian 

national team, posted a score over 13 
points higher than Herremans, the 
next-highest finisher, in the three-
meter diving.

One of the biggest takeaways 

from the meet was the sheer energy 
the team had, even after an intense 
week of training going in.

“You saw their spirit, how much 

they were supporting each other,” 
Bottom said. “The way we’re going 
to get better is supporting each 
other.”

Added Montague: “Everyone on 

the sideline (is) cheering for every 
single swim. (My favorite part) is the 
team aspect. It’s really motivating 
and really helps … me to swim really 
fast. It’s good to start the year off 
with some wins, so we’re gonna 
work off of that.”

Pearson era begins with perfect 10

L

et’s begin with the 
obvious.

This was an exhibition 

game. In September. Against 
a team 
that isn’t a 
member of 
the NCAA 
and finished 
8-16-4 last 
season.

This 

was Mel 
Pearson’s 
first game 
as head 
coach of the 
Michigan hockey team — the first 
time in 34 seasons someone not 
named Red Berenson has led the 

Wolverines. And by the end of 
the season, that’s probably all the 
Wolverines’ 10-1 rout of Western 
Ontario will be remembered for.

One could label this game as 

entirely meaningless in terms of 
actual hockey — that there are 
no significant conclusions to be 
drawn.

But if that’s the case, why 

schedule the game at all?

Draw whatever conclusions 

you like. But Michigan was 
utterly dominant Saturday night.

The scoreline says as much. 

The Wolverines’ highest-scoring 
game last season was a 6-3 
exhibition win over the U.S. 
National Team Development 
Program. On Saturday, Michigan 

reached that total in the second 
period.

Not even the high-octane 

Wolverine attack of two seasons 
ago — which averaged 4.8 goals 
per game — scored 10 goals in a 
single game. Michigan’s offensive 
output was its largest since a 
10-6 victory against Ohio State 
in 2015.

The Wolverines had no 

shortage of problems last season, 
and one was quite simple: They 
just couldn’t score. Michigan was 
42nd of 60 teams in goals per 
game and third-worst in Corsi 
percentage, a measure of shot 
differential and puck possession.

Against the Mustangs, the 

Wolverines won the opening 

faceoff and didn’t look back, 
firing crisp passes and flying 
around the rink. Just four 
minutes after the game began, 
Michigan had its first goal when 
the puck deflected into the net 
off of senior forward Dexter 
Dancs’ stick. The Wolverines 
were consistent throughout, with 
another goal in the first period 
and four goals each in the second 
and third.

Quite frankly, Michigan 

didn’t look like this, or even 
close to this, at any point last 
season. In their first exhibition 
against Windsor last year, the 
Wolverines won 2-0, outshooting 
the Lancers just 36-32.

One of Pearson’s first 

tasks as head coach has been 
implementing a more possession-
and-speed based approach on 
offense this season. That much 
was on display Saturday, as 
Michigan finished with 60 shots 
on goal to Western Ontario’s 20.

“Guys just buying into the 

system,” said senior forward 
Tony Calderone. “A lot of guys 
are starting to hold on to the 
puck more, get more confident. 
We had a young team last year, 
now guys are older and getting 
more confident in the college 
game.”

It wasn’t just the volume of 

goals scored, but who scored 
them. Calderone found the net 
twice to lead the way offensively, 
but eight others lit the lamp too. 
Five players didn’t score but 
chipped in with assists as well.

Pearson attributed this 

egalitarianism to strong team 
chemistry, which the coaching 
staff has sought to implement 
while also hoping it continues to 
develop naturally.

“We had some good line 

combinations and some good 
chemistry,” Pearson said. “It’s 
hard to force that chemistry, you 
either have it sometimes or you 

don’t. There’s a real good vibe 
in the locker room right now 
and you can see that when they 
played together.”

Again, this was just an 

exhibition. After the game, 
Pearson and his players were the 
first to admit as much.

“There’s some areas we need 

to be better at,” Pearson said. 
“We need to understand that as 
we go forward, we’re going to 
continue to play against better 
opponents.”

But Pearson and his players 

have also been quick to talk 
of a new team spirit — a new, 
energetic dynamic with a new, 
energetic coaching staff. One 
could easily wave that off as 
cliché.

But it certainly seemed to be 

true Saturday night.

“It was good to get out there 

and just get a feel for where we 
are,” Pearson said. “I thought it 
was a good start.”
