Timothy Lynch, the deputy
general counsel for litigation
and enforcement at the U.S.
Department of Energy, has
been recommended as the'
University's next vice presi-
dent and general counsel by
University President Mary Sue
Coleman.
If approved by the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents at its
monthly meeting on Thursday,
* Lynch will assume the posi-
tion on Jan. 7. He'll suceed
Suellyn Scarnecchia, who
stepped down in May to return
to a faculty position at the Uni-

versity Law School.
In her recommendation to
the regents, Coleman wrote
that Lynch is highly qualified
for the position as the Univer-
sity's chief attorney.
"I look forward to the lead-
ership, depth of experience,
and vision that Mr. Lynch
will bring to the University
as vice president and general
counsel," Coleman wrote.
"The Board of Regents and
I are deeply committed to
maintaining a well-respected
and superior office of general
counsel for the university, and
we are very confident that Mr.
Lynch will excel in managing
this area."
Associate General Counsel
Debra Kowich assumed the
position of interim vice presi-
dent and general counsel while
the University searched for
someone to permanently fill the
position. The national search

State appeals judge's ruling

Former Asst. AG

By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
In a motion filed yesterday,
state officials asked an Ingham
County judge to reconsider her

recent decision to grant unem-
ployment benefits to Andrew,
Shirvell, a former Michigan
assistant attorney general who
was accused of stalking and
harassing Chris Armstrong, the
first openly gay president of the
University's student govern-

Shirvell's employment was
officially terminated by the
state in 2012 after a long leave

of absence resulting from his
harassment of Armstrong.
Beginning in 2010, Shirvell
operated a blog tracking the
student leader's movements
and warning readers about his
"radical homosexual agenda."
The blog included images of a
swastika adorned rainbow flag
pointing at Armstrong's face.

Minutes not posted

assembly meeting

For the Daily
As the semester passes the
halfway point, the Central Stu-
dent Government has not public-

ly released resolutions, meeting
minutes or agendas from the past
three months in a manner con-
sistent with its governing docu-
ments.
The minutes were last pub-
lished on Sept. 25, and CSG has
neglected to upload information
from five, meetings since that
date.
Article II of the CSG Consti-
tutionr states that the Assem-

bly "shall produce, publish, and

More than 675 'U'

By ARIANA ASAAF
For the Daily
Six World War II veterans,
proudly wearing baseball caps
and leather jackets adorned
with patches, spoke about serv-
ing in the U.S. military and

returning from service at a Vet-
erans Day event Tuesday eve-
ning.
The event, hosted by the
University's Student Veterans
Assistance Program, was part
of Veterans Week 2012, a pro-
gram started five years ago to
showcase, honor and support
veterans affiliated with the
University.
At the event, the panelists
each gave detailed recounts of
their experiences at war.

Bob Davis, one of the speak-
ers, said he was drafted in 1943
after his freshman year at the
University. On his first day of
combat in Germany, he was
wounded and spent the next 90
days in a hospital, but remained
with his division until the end
of the war. After he was dis-
charged, he looked into continu-
ing his education by contacting
an old roommate, who told him
they would "put a bed in the

Florida socialite started
Petraeus investigation r

Threats from Paula
Broadwell triggered
concerns from FBI
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - If you
were to diagram the increasingly
tangled sex scandal surround-
ing former CIA Director David
Petraeus, nearly all lines would
lead back to one person: Jill Kel-
ley, a 37-year-old Tampa social-
ite who hosted parties for the
nation's top military brass.
The raven-haired woman's
complaint about anonymous,
threatening email triggered the
investigation that led to Petrae-
us' downfall. And now she is at
the center of an investigation
of the top U.S. commander in
Afghanistan over alleged "inap-
propriate communications"
between the two.
Kelley is a close friend'of the
Petraeus family, and photo-
graphs circulating the Internet
show her posing for pictures

at parties, sometimes in short
dresses with Petreaus, his wife,
and sometimes her husband, a
cancer surgeon. Kelley served as
a sort of unofficial social ambas-
sador for U.S. Central Command
in Tampa, hosting parties for the
general when he was command-
er there from 2008-10.
She met Gen. John Allen while
he was at Central Command, and
now investigators are looking at
some of the 20,000-plus pages of
documents and emails between
Allen and Kelley that have
been described as "flirtatious,"
according to a senior defense
official who spoke on condition
of anonymity because he wasn't
authorized to discuss the case
publicly.
Allen denies that he has
engaged in any wrongdoing.
For her part, Kelley has kept
a low profile since Petraeus'
affair with his biographer, Paula
Broadwell, became public after
Kelley told an FBI agent that
she had received a threatening

S U n-O K U

email, which later
turned out tobe from Broadwell.
Investigators are still look-
ing into whether any classified
documents were ever leaked or
in the wrong hands.
Outside Kelley's stately,
two-story brick home in South
Tampa, a horde of media gath-
ered. A woman believed to be
Kelley was seen inside the large
windows of the house, which
has a half-dozen white columns,
black shutters and a neatly mani-
cured lawn. A silver Mercedes
5500 in the driveway has a
license plate marked "Honorary
Counsel," perhaps belonging to
Kelley's twin sister, Natalie Kha-
wam, who is an attorney also
lives at the home.
Ken Walters, aneighbor, called
the Kelleys good friends, but said
he doesn't see them all that often.
Walters said he went to a party
the couple had to celebrate their
first son's baptism. The Kelleys
have two other children.
"Natalie and her sister, they're
certainly not shrinking violets,"
he said.
Jill Kelley's brother David
Khawam told WPVI-TV in Phila-
delphia on Monday night that
details of the allegations surged
fast.
"It's happened extremely
quickly, we're talking 12, 24
hours, maximum, since we've
found out about this. It's a shock.
We're trying to figure out where
the pieces are falling right now,"
Khawam said in the interview
done at his offices in Westmont,
N.J.
He said that his family left
Lebanon for Huntingdon Valley
in Montgomery County in Penn-
sylvania in the 1970s to escape
turmoil and fighting. His par-
ents opened a Middle Eastern
food restaurant in Vorhees, N.J.,
called Sahara.
"My family is very patriotic;
we came from Lebanon at a
young age," he said.
At some point, the Jill Kelley
married and moved to Florida
with her husband, who works at
a cancer clinic in the area.

Leaders plan to cede
national sovereignty
to fix euro banking
and fiscal crises
BRUSSELS (AP) - Euro-
pean finance ministers inched
toward strengthening their
banking sectors and the man-
agement of their economies at
a meeting in Brussels on Tues-
day, but put off decisions on
comprehensive solutions to the
region's financial crisis.
Weakness, in the banking
sector and inadequate moni-
toring of national budgets
were among the prime causes
of Europe's three-year crisis,
which has seen several coun-
tries struggle with too much
debt. Fixing those areas is cru-
cial not only to ending the cur-
rent crisis but also preventing a
repeat.
European leaders have
agreed, in theory, to cede sig-
nificant amounts of sovereignty
to fix those problems. As part
of this plan, the European Cen-
tral Bank will be put in charge
of all of the banks in the 17
countries that use the euro by

as early as next year. And they
have proposed giving the Euro-
pean Commission, the Euro-
pean Union's executive arm,
the power to review and even
reject their national budgets to
prevent against overspending.
But actually implementing
those ideas has proved difficult.
Germany, for instance, is wary
of ceding control over its banks
while Britain is nervous that a
coordinated eurozone banking
sector will have a greater say
in discussions over regulations
that apply to all 27 nations of
the EU. And several countries
are concerned about the voter
backlash that would be sparked
by handing too much power to
the Commission.
After months of heightened
activity over banking and eco-
nomic oversight - a move that
markets and investors have
largely welcomed' - it seems
the EU has now put on the
brakes while it hamniers out
the details.
Austrian Finance Minister
Maria Fekter said, for instance,
that creatinga single supervisor
for all the banks may require a
time-consuming treaty change.
That would knock the EU way
off its timeline of getting a

supervisor at least partially in
place next year.
"I don't want to speed up
without having discussed the
best solution," she said. "Speed
kills when we don't have the
best solution."
It's unclear how long mar-
kets will wait, though. official
figures due later this week are
expected to show the eurozone
fell into recession - technical-
ly defined as two consecutive
quarters of economic contrac-
tion - inthethird quarter. Even
Germany, the continent's larg-
est economy, is slowing, as was
evident in an unexpected drop
in the ZEW survey of investor
confidence on Tuesday.
"There is still the same
lack of urgency that has sent
the markets into a frenzy on
numerous occasions in the past
few years," said James Hughes,
chief market analyst, for Alpari.
Meanwhile, Spain's banks
desperately need an infusion
of cash and are hoping to get
it from the European bailout
fund. But they won't be allowed
to until they are under the
watchful eye of the ECB. So any
delay in setting up the supervi-
sor system would delay a Span-
ish rescue.

Hundreds of protesters were convergingon the Greek capital's main square outside Parliament on Sunday evening, as lawmakers debated the
2013 budget, which includes cuts demanded by international creditors in order for them to approve the next vital batch of rescue loans.

AMARILLO, Texas
Student terrorist
given life in prison
for making bomb
A former Texas college student
from Saudi Arabia was sentenced
to life in prison Tuesday for try-
ing to make a bomb for use in a
religious attack, possibly target-
ing a former U.S. president.
Rhalid Ali-M Aldawsari was
sentenced in Amarillo, where
jurors convicted him in June of
attempting to use a weapon of
mass destruction. Prosecutors
say he had collected bomb-mak-
ing material in his apartment
and researched possible targets,
including the Dallas home of for-
mer President George W. Bush. A
handwritten journal found in his
apartment included notes that he
believed it was time for "jihad," a
Muslim term for holy war.
Although the 22-year-old
Aldawsari apologized Tuesday
for "these bad actions," Judge
Donald E. Walter said the evi-
dence against him was over-
whelming. Walter acknowledged
he was conflicted due to Aldawsa-
ri's youth and signs that outside
influences had led him astray.

Syria's rebels pick
cleric as new leader
Syria's political opposition has
struggled to prove its relevance
amid the civil war under a leader-
ship largely made up of academ-
ics and exiled politicians. With its
relaunch as a new organization, it
has taken a different tack: choos-
ing as its head a popular Muslim
cleric who preaches sectarian
unity and can fire up a crowd.
The selection of a moderate
religious figure, Mouaz al-Khat-
ib, to head the Syrian National
Coalition for Opposition and
Revolutionary Forces is also an
attempt to counter the growing

influence of Islamic extremists
in the rebellion against President
Bashar Assad.
While lackingin political expe-
rience, the 52-year-old preacher-
turned-activist is described by
Syrians as a man of the people
- a modest, unifying figure who
commands wide respect among
the country's various opposition
groups and rebels.

University's vice president and
secretary.
As of Tuesday evening, Lynch
was not available for comment.
If approved, his contract will last
from January 2013 through Jan-
uary 2018. University spokesman
Rick Fitzgerald declined to pro-
vide details regarding Lynch's
proposed compensation pack-
age until after his appointment
is considered by the regents on
Thursday.
Lynch has spent almost his

entire legal career working with
the U.S. government. After he
graduated from the Georgetown
University Law Center in 1995,
he worked as a law clerk for U.S.
Appeals Court Judge Cornelia
Kennedy for about a year.
After working for the now
defunct Washington, D.C.-based
Shea & Gardner law firm for
about six years, he served as an
assistant U.S. attorney in Wash-
ington, specializing in fraud and
public corruption. Next, Lynch
served as an assistant chief litiga-
tion counsel withtheU.S. Securi-
ties and Exchanges Commission,
before joining the Department of
Energy in April2010.

During his career as an assis-
tant U.S. attorney, Timothy
received praise from his peers
and superiors for his prosecut-
ing skills in a number of cases.
At the Department of Justice, he
served as the "point" attorney
for residents who were exposed
to radiation hazards from the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation in
Washington state.
While he was at the Depart-
ment of Energy, Lynch briefly
served as acting general coun-
sel from December 2011 to April
2012, after then acting general
counsel Sean Lev became the
deputy general counsel at the
Federal Communications Com-

mission.
In a question and answer
session with the Virginia Law
Weekly, he told the paper he was,
proud to be a part of the Depart-
ment of Energy, and praised the
agency's leadership on alterna-
tive energy and sustainability
issues.
"In all seriousness, the
Department is doing truly
important and cutting-edge
work now to foster clean-ener-
gy projects that will help our
nation wean itself from foreign
oil and safeguard the environ-
ment while creating new jobs,"
Lynch said.

dates, "the front office staff
shall, as part of their respon-
sibilities, within seventy-two
hours of the adjournment of
a Student Assemble meeting,
publish the Assembly Register
to the CSG web site."
"Anything that the Assembly
votes to accept, that goes under
business, should be eventually
posted underthe archives onthe
CSG website," said Engineering
sophomoreAndrewModell,vice
chair of the CSG Rules Commit-
tee - a committee designed to
govern the agenda and proceed-
ings of the CSG.
Following an interview with
members of the CSG rules com-
mittee at its weekly meeting
on Sunday, recent resolutions
- that were previously absent
from CSG's website - were
added to the site.
Chapter V of the Operating
Procedures of the Assembly,
providing instruction for the
treatment of assembly records,
requires the existence of an
Assembly Journal, or a "ver-
bal, verbatim transcript by the
Secretary" of the proceedings
of every meeting. Though the
chapter states that the assembly
would make each of these tran-
scripts accessible to the public
within two weeks after a meet-
ing, these transcripts are also
not available online.
The chapter did not specify
who would be responsible for
publishing these on the CSG
website, and, at Tuesday's
assembly meeting, assembly
chair Michael Proppe said that
is part of the problem.
"The language in the com-
piled code is right now not
good,"he said. "I actually spent
most of my weekend working on
fixing the compiled to fix proce-
dural stuff like that so that it's
clear who is putting that stuff
online."
Proppe, who said he himself
takes responsibility for the late-
ness, added that the compiled

codes mentions a webmaster, a
position that currently doesn't
exist.
Though the CSG website
hasn't been updated per the
standards in its governing doc-
uments, Law School student
Jeremy Keeney, chair of the
Rules Committee, pointed out
social networking is an easy
and accessible way for students
to stay up-to-date with the hap-
penings of CSG.
He added that most of the
minutes and resolutions of the
organization are posted on the
committee's Facebook page.
"Actually, our Rules Com-
mittee Facebook group has all
of our minutes, all of our agen-
das," he said.
Modell, nonetheless, noted
a lack of awareness among stu-
dents about the Rules Committee
and its role in governing the pro-
ceedings ofAssembly meetings.
"If anyone looks at the min-
utes or attends the student
Assembly meetings then they
will have a good idea of what
the Rules Committee will be
doing," Modell said.
He added that he would like
for the group to have greater
interaction with students in the
future.
"We would love students to
reach out to us," he said. "Usu-
ally if they have a complaint,
they would just show up at the
Assembly meeting and discuss
it during their Community Con-
cerns, as opposed to discussing
it with the Rules Committee as
should happen."
CSG president Manish
Parikh added that in previous
years, the student government
website has not been used to its
potential.
"(The website has) rarely
been updated with information
but this year we're making this
a focus," he said. "We're start-
ing at zero and we're shooting
for a hundred." He continued,
saying that CSG is "making
progress and I think within a
week or two you'll notice that
things are being uploaded in a
timely matter."

Huron Street and I-94 in Ypsilanti
Township. James was arrested
and charged with Unlawfully
Driving Away an Automobile.
In the police report, obtained
through a Freedom of Informa-
tion Act request, a bus supervisor
told the officer that James was
fired by the University's Trans-
portation and Parking services
two years ago. At first, James told
the officer that he was on a "late
run," and had left his driver's
license with a friend, but later
acknowledged that he was no lon-
ger an employee when confronted
by the officer, who spoke with a
bus supervisor.
James acknowledged that he
had not worked for the University
for two years, but noted that his
employment keys were not taken
away upon his dismissal.
. The report further states that
James, who had alcohol in his
system at the time, used the keys

to enter the yard and take the
bus. The manner in which James
entered the bus lot was not previ-
ously made public.
James told the arresting officer
he took the bus to relieve internal
stress. '
"It has been a stressful year
looking for work, but hopefully
that changes today," James said to
the judge at his preliminary hear-
ing in the 14-A District Court on
Oct. 4. "Iwas under a lot ofstress."
Normally the University con-
fiscates keys from employees once
they leave their jobs.
However, University spokes-
man Rick Fitzgerald said there
were "unusual circumstances"
involved with this incident.
Fitzgerald declined to spec-
ify the unusual circumstances
involved in the case but said Park-
ing and Transportation Services
is looking into what happened to
minimize the chance of a similar
incident occurring.
"(Parking and Transporta-
tion Services is) taking another
look at their process as well as

dence as an adjunct professor
at the Georgetown University
Law Center and also teaches
white-collar crime as an adjunct
professor at the University of
Virginia Law School.
When asked by the paper
what kind of main charac-
ter he would write in a novel,
Lynch replied "A retired DA
who fishes during the day and
at night reads Oliver Wen-
dell Holmes opinions, drinks
whiskey, plays jazz piano, and
works on pro-bono criminal
defense cases with his friend,
Parnell. Oh, damn, that's
Anatomy of a Murder. I'll have
to keep at it."
any additional security measures
that they could take tobe practi-
cal for their operations," he said.
Over the last several years,
the University has switched to
using MCards instead of keys on
many campus buildings includ-
ing residence halls, classrooms,
administrative offices and hos-
pital buildings. Fitzgerald said
MCard access is centrally con-
trolled, making it much easier to
regulate who has access to Uni-
versity buildings. When employ-
ees leave the University under
the MCard system, their access
to University buildings can be
revoked electronically without
having to collect former employ-
ees' MCards.
Not every lock can feasibly be
converted into a MCard reader,
but the University is heading in
that direction, Fitzgerald said.
James pleaded guilty to
receiving and concealing stolen
property - a lesser offense than
what he was charged with - in
October. He is scheduled to be
sentenced next month.


SHIRVELL
From Page 1A
sation in 2010 after he partook
in a now-infamous interview
with CNN host Anderson Coo-
per, during which he defended
his portrayal of Armstrong as
"Satan's representative."
In August, Armstrong was
awarded $4.5 million in .dam-
ages in a defamation suit against
Shirvell.
Ingham County Circuit Judge
Paula Mansfield ruled in October
that Shirvell is entitled under
Michigan law to unemployment
aid from the Michigan Unem-
ployment Insurance Agency. The
latest petition by the state seeks
to overturn that ruling and deny
Shirvell the benefits.
Shirvell's request for unem-
ployment was initially denied
because he was dismissed from
the attorney general's office
for misconduct relating to his
harassment of Armstrong. Man-

sfield's order reversed the initial
decision.
"The law is on my side,"
Shirvell said in an interview
Tuesday evening. "The state's
refusal to award me unemploy-
ment compensation was blatant-
ly unconstitutional because all
of my activities relating to Chris
Armstrong were done on my own
time and they constituted first
amendment protected activi-
ties."
Shirvell said the state could
take the case to an appellate
court should their request fail
to reverse Mansfield's ruling. He
added that the state's strategy
is to turn public opinion against
the judge in attempt to either
reverse the ruling or apply for an
appeal.
"I've looked at a copy of their
filing (with Mansfield)," Shirvell
said. "Their filing reeks of des-
peration."
Shirvell declined to comment
on whether he was having any
success finding another job.

"I will see this through to
the very end," Shirvell said in
September. "I know in the end
I'll be successful, even if it goes
to the Supreme Court."
Yesterday an interview with
Armstrong's lead attorney,
Deborah Gordon, was broad-
casted on CNN's "Anderson
Cooper 360." In response,
Shirvell wrote in a statement
that Cooper's coverage was
"profoundly biased" and that
CNN legal analyst Jeffery
Toobin and Cooper went on a
"rampage and tried to blatant-
ly intimidate Judge Mansfield
into reversing her correct deci-
sion."
"As for Deborah Gordon,
I note that Cooper failed to
mention the fact that I am cur-
rently suing Gordon in federal
court for defamation and inva-
sion of privacy for her past
media appearances ..." Shirvell
wrote. "I fully expect Judge
Mansfield not to be intimidat-
ed by the likes of Gordon."

closet" for him if necessary. David
said the gesture was a "wonder-
ful way to come home," and he
returned to the University for his
sophomore year before receiving
his degree in 1949.
Fellow University alum Bill
Rosnya and B17 bomber navi-
gator said he was drafted into
the military in high school. He
hadn't planned on attending

college, and upon his return he
began looking for a job with Ford
Motor Company. However, he
said his high school counselor
told him, "you're going to Michi-
gan, I'll take care of it," and he
became the first in his family to
graduate from college.
Wendell Galbraith, another
panelist,said he was drafted when
he was 18 and joined the Army Air
Forces, where he was assigned to
bomb Vienna. Galbraith's plane
was hit during the attack and
he was forced to escape, but lie
pulled his parachute too soon.*He

said he spent 35 minutes floating
down over the city and landed
in the midst of a group of armed
German soldiers.
"Twenty-five German soldiers
had guns pointed at me," Gal-
braith said. "One German solider
loaded a pistol, put it to my head,
and then put it back. I still don't
know why he did that."
Henry Hoyna graduated from
high school in 1941 and enrolled
in the Marine Corps the fol-
lowing year. After the Battle of
Tarawa, a 1943 engagement over
a small atoll in the center of the

Pacific Ocean, Hoyna and 2,000
other soldiers departed for Pearl
Harbor. When they returned to
Hawaii, he witnessed the dev-
astation from Japan's infamous
Dec. 7,1941 attack.
"It was the most awesome
thing," Hoyna said. "You could
hear a pin drop, that's how much
it shocked us."
During World War II, indi-
viduals at the University actively
intercepted messages from Japa-
nese diplomats and soldiers, and
West Quad Residence Hall was
used as barracks for the Students'

Army Training Corps, according
to SVAP coordinator Phil Larson.
Larson said more than 400
faculty veterans work at the Uni-
versity and about 275 student
veterans are enrolled at the Uni-
versity, mostly from the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan.
Larson said the students
involved in the SVAP have made
great strides in advancing veter-
an awareness since their found-
ing.

Sma llsteps to legalization
Regulate marijuana like alcohol on federal level
ov. 6 was a monumental day in American history, but not for
the presidential reasons one may first assume. Throughout
the country, various marijuana support ballot proposals
garnered landslide victories. Each one passed works toward drug
reform on a small scale, but with a similar large-scale goal in mind
- total legalization throughout the United States, where federal law
criminalizes pot. In Michigan, five individual cities voted to change
marijuana laws, taking small steps in the uphill battle toward legal-
ization. However, this isn't enough. Michigan, along with the rest of
the United States, should take a similar stance toward marijuana as
it does alcohol. It should follow the trail of Colorado and Washing-
ton in passing legislation allowing marijuana for recreational and
medicinal purposes with appropriate regulation.

No' is the easy way out

participated in policy debate
for four years during high
school. We were given a broad
topic proposition
and assigned
roles - either
the affirmative
or the negative.
The proposition 7
would be some
sort of resolu-
tion like "The U.
S. federal, gov- IARSHA
ernment should NAHATA
substantially
increase social
services for persons living in pover-
ty in the United States" (an example
resolution from 2009).
If we were assigned the role of
the affirmative team, our responsi-
bility was to create a plan, as broad
or as specific as we wanted, that in
some way accomplished the stated
goal of the resolution. For example,
for the resolution mentioned above,
anything from expanding social
welfare programs such as Unem-
ployment Assistance, Medicaid or
Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families, just to name a few, to
reforming laws to provide better
social services. There was gener-
ally a wide range of possibilities -
the only constraint being the plan's
ability to effectively accomplish
what was stated in the resolution..
If we were the negative team,
on the other hand, our role was
to throw counterarguments at
the affirmative plan. We would
research a wide variety of attacks,
ensuring we had something that
could apply to any type of plan the
affirmative might think up.
In policy debate, there were five
to six categories that were debat-

ed, and on which each team was
judged. Essentially, these were
the points that each side had to be
convincing on. For the affirmative,
they had to convince that there was
a need for the plan - actual prob-
lems that merited such proposals
- a current barrier to implement-
ing their plan, feasibility in terms of
logistics, funding and enforcement
- and, finally, that their plan would
work. The proposal should solve the
problems addressed and overcome
the barrier cited. But in addition
to that, the affirmative team was
burdened with the responsibility of
ensuring that the plan didn't do any
more damage to the status quo.
To win a debate, the affirmative
team had to win on every single one
of these points. They had to have
sound arguments that could stand
up to the negative team in each of
these categories.
What did the negative team have
to do to win? Win only one argu-
ment. If they could dismantle one
aspect of the affirmative team's
case, they won.
Now, you might be wondering
why I'm giving such a long descrip-
tion of debate technicalities. The
fact is that there's a very valuable
lesson embedded in the structure of
policy debate.
The way of judging the effec-
tiveness of a policy proposal isn't
limited to policy debate. In fact, it's
something that very much carries
over into the political sphere. The
lesson is that to be effective and con-
vincing, the side opposing a policy
change, the "negative," only really
needs one sticking argument. They
need one point that can in some way
discredit the proposed policy. Any-
time there is a change to the status

quo, the burden of evidence is on the
individuals proposing that change.
They have to win on almost every
point. And if they can't, they have to
be able to convince the public that
benefits of the plan far outweigh any
potential negatives.
It's easy to
discredit a new
idea and go with
the status quo.
The point being that anytime a
policy is proposed, it's always eas-
ier to be on the side saying "no."
And our politicians will confirm
that. Today, anytime something is
proposed by the other side, there's
a line of naysayers ready to speak
out. It's easy to discredit a new idea,
especially when people naturally
drift toward the status quo.
While it is easier, it's not nec-
essarily better. Progress doesn't
happen in this way. We need new
ideas and new proposals to solve
the policy Issues we currently face.
Simply saying "No" or putting forth
endless counterarguments against
them won't actually solve any
issues. While purely attacking the
other side might be a good strategy
for winning debates - and for poli-
ticians, elections - when it comes
to moving forward as a nation, it's
a strategy that'll cause us all to lose
in the end.

U

Grand Rapids, Flint and Detroit voted to
decriminalize marijuana. Ypsilanti - advo-
cated for by the Students for a Sensible Drug
Policy at Eastern Michigan University -
chose a more symbolic act, voting to make
possession of the drug the lowest prior-
ity for law enforcement officials. Meanwhile,
Kalamazoo voters called for better regulation
of marijuana dispensaries by the city. Each of
these ballot measures passed with more than
55 percent of the vote.
While a stigma against marijuana use still
exists, the ,widespread passage of amend-
ments across the country suggests that many
citizens are open to legalization. Similar to
the shifting views against the prohibition
of liquor in the late 1920s, popular opinion
about marijuana is changing. Medical and
recreational purposes have become more
accepted by society.
The main ingredient in marijuana, tetrahy-
drocannabinol, bonds with lipids in the body,
causing it to stay in the system longer than
many other substances. While alcohol persists
in the blood for only a few days, traces of mari-
juana can be found in the urine weeks after
use. As a result, employers and law enforce-
ment officials face difficulty in determining
the accurate time of use, and whether or not it

should factor into legal situations. Though sali-
va, urine, blood and hair follicle tests already
exist, they are neither cost-efficient nor effec-
tive for determining whether misuse occurred
in the workplace or behind the wheel.
Smoking pot is a personal choice simi-
lar to drinking alcohol. It also has medici-
nal properties beneficial to cancer patients,
those afflicted with arthritis or fibromyal-
gia, and others suffering from depression
and eating disorders. Studies have proven
the long-term effects relatively harmless and
addiction rate practically non-existent, espe-
cially in comparison to prescription drugs
such as morphine or Vicodin. Marijuana can
be a dangerous substance in the same way as
alcohol. However, individuals who moder-
ate their usage of these substances should be
able to decide for themselves when it comes
to marijuana use.
Rather than'fill jails to fight this form of
drug use - which is ineffective with atrocious
costs and minimal results - full legalization
should be implemented. Current possession
charges allow for legal discrimination against
otherwise harmless people. The stigma about
the personal choice to use marijuana is erod-
ing, paving the way toward widespread legal-
ization throughout the country.

KEVIN TUNG I VIEWPOINT
Denied choices in China

peanut in hand, I slowly
walk toward one of the
mall, fuzzy rodents moving
busily from tree
to tree, and nut
to buried nut. I
wave the peanut
up and down and
a squirrel snaps
its head around
to look right at
me, sitting up
on its hind legs. ERIC
I kneel, arm FERGUSON
extended, as it
approaches the
peanut slowly but determinedly,
loping through the chilly November
grass. I accidentally jerk my hand a
little to the right, and the squirrel
scampers back a few steps in exag-
gerated alarm but is not deterred
from its quest. It comes right up to
me and takes the peanut out of my
hand with the utmost care, cock-
ing its head in order to get just the
right grip. I let go and it takes a few
hopping steps away from me before
sitting on its hind legs and taking
the nut from its mouth to between
its front paws. With practiced
precision, the squirrel systemati-
cally removes the shell to get at the
nutty goodness within, while I grab
another peanut and go search for
another squirrel to feed.
This is what happens on Sundays
during good weather for members
of the Squirrel Club, like myself. For
no more than an hour, I take a hand-
ful of peanuts into the Diag and for-
get about most of the daily concerns

of the college student: the readings,
the essays, the homework, the all-
important balance between work
and play that makes college neither
a place for pure academiaor constant
partying, but an engrossing mix of
the two. At this point in the semes-
ter, with professors trying to wrap
things up before Thanksgiving and
final exams barely a month away,
finding something to do for a little
while that's totally unrelated to aca-
demics clears my head so when I do
return to work, I'm in a better men-
tal place than when I left. And with
all of the other hurdles that life can
throw at a person - like the end of a
relationship or problems involving a
family member - sometimes it's best
to just engage in an activity where all
of that becomes irrelevant for a little
while. Plus, you get to make squirrels
happy!
Apart from being fun, it can be
good for your health to have a lei-
sure activity, whether it's feeding
squirrels, playing basketball, vol-
unteering around Ann Arbor or
getting your gank on in League of
Legends. I'm not alone in receiv-
ing stress-reduction benefits from
this; one study has shown that
along with reducing symptoms of
stress, leisure activities can also
reduce the symptoms of anxiety
and depression.
Anyone reading this should con-
sider becoming a Michigan Squir-
reler, though, even if it's just for an
afternoon. It's really hard to be in a
bad mood when feeding a squirrel,
with passersby looking at you with

a combination of curiosity and won-
der and a sleek, grey-furred animal
with the fluffiest of tails chowing
down on something you gave it. Fat
squirrels, skinny squirrels, groups of
squirrels, loner squirrels who would
rather crouch in the bushes near
the Chemistry Building than come
onto the Diag proper - getting one
of them to come over and grab a nut
out of your hand isn't really some-
thing that can be imagined. You
have to try it. And if you do, and you
enjoy it as much as I do, get a friend
out there and convince them to try
it for themselves. While doing it by
yourself is fun, spreading the joy of
squirreling with other people can be
even more entertaining.
There are many
leisurely campus
activities to
try out.
If feeding the squirrels isn't your
thing, that's fine. It'll mean more
squirrels for me, and there's no
shortage of other leisurely campus
activities that one can partake in. But
whether you're stressed out, enjoy
small animals or are just plain bored,
squirrel feeding is an activity sure to
brighten your day.

I believe that the ability to make choices is
a God-given right inherent in all living crea-
tures that are capable of thinking conscious-
ly. As humans, we have the capability to think
consciously, which therefore bestows upon
us the inherent right to make choices. These
choices could be as insignificant as the type
of coffee we purchase at Starbucks, or as con-
sequential as the future of a baby whose life
is tantamount in significance with that of the
person making the choice.
Abortion has always been a controversial
topic in the United States. People voice their
stance as either pro-choice or pro-life in end-
less debates across the country. However, in
China, a woman's right to decide whether to
keep or abort the baby is denied. The depriva-
tion of this inherent right is only the tip of the
iceberg - it's indicative of a brutally repressed
society where human rights abuses, tortures
and disappearances of political dissidents
often vanish and go without a formal charge, a
just trial or due process.
China has enforced the One-Child Policy
since 1979. The policy may be an effective
way to ease China's overpopulation problem,
yet the unjust implementation of this policy
fundamentally intrudes in the lives of Chi-
nese women by depriving them of the right
to choose. In an article published by USA
Today, Calum Macleod tells a tragic story
that took place in Daji Township, a Fujian
province in China. A township supervisor,
whose obligation was to monitor family plan-
ning and enforce the rules of the Communist
Party, gathered eight men to kidnap a preg-
nant woman, Pan Chunyan, from her grocery
store. They took Chunyan to a nearby hospital
and forcibly injected chemicals into her, thus
killing the child. The woman delivered a fully
formed dead baby. One could only imagine the
emotions running through Chunyan's mind.
This incident reflected the social injustice
and the lack of respect for civil liberties and
human rights that still exist in China to this

day. These are important problems that need
to be addressed. The rapidly growing Chinese
economy is a result of careful and strict cen-
tral regulations and monitoring; however, it's
evident that the Communist Party has abused
its untouchable authorities when their policies
greatly harmed the fundamental rights and
liberties of the Chinese people.
Two resolutions were passed to investi-
gate the abuses of human rights in China in
hopes of helping the Chinese citizens who are
suffering from the unethical and inhumane
ways of the Communist rule. First, Resolu-
tion 232: Recognizing the continued perse-
cution of Falun Gong practitioners in China,
and Resolution 497: Government of the Peo-
ple's Republic of China should immediately
release from custody the children of Reebyia
Kadeer. There needs to be more efforts by the
United States, the United Nations and the rest
of the world, in a collective manner, directed
towards calling on the government of the PRC
to terminate all acts of unreasonable violence
that put an individual's fundamental rights to
life in grave harm.
Each individual rightly possesses the abil-
ity to choose. Denying the pregnant woman
of her right to choose whether to abort or
keep her child and forcibly injecting chemi-
cals into her body not only violated a woman's
right to choose but also the right to her own
body. This incident was fortunate enough to
have been reported; many other equally bru-
tal tragedies were often buried or erased by
the Chinese government.
This has to stop. The United States and other
developed, democratic nations should heed
human rights abuses in China and take actions
to put an end to the social injustices that are
becoming a threat to our efforts to achieving
a global community with higher and stronger
moral codes, where each individual rightly
possesses and enjoys his or her rights to life.

Images of conflict
Knight-Wallace
Fellow Kate Brooks _

A Thanksgiving turkey
that tickles taste buds

to share experiences
By JOHN BOHN
Daily Arts Writer
After the events of 9/11, pho-
tojournalist Kate Brooks - 23
years old at the time - was given
a four-day
assignment
in Pakistan to
document U.S. Forum
negotiations Presents: A
with the Tali-
ban, which Conversation
held a group with Kate
of Americans
hostage at the Brooks and
time. Juan Ri. Cole
She ended
up staying Wednesday
to cover the at 5:30 p.m.
region for the Hatcher Graduate
next decade. Library
"It was very Free
clear to me
once the U.S.
began bombing Afghanistan that
it was the beginning of a very
long story," said Brooks, who is a
current Knight-Wallace Fellow at
the University.
Brooks has been all over the
Middle East, from Afghanistan to
Lebanon to Iraq, photographing
and documenting the wars, revo-
lutions and political movements
that have shaped the course of
events in the region over the last
decade.
With the amount of conflict
in the area, her work is anything
but ordinary. "Current and past
wars have affected everyone in
the region," she said. In addition
to the chaos of conflict, the job
of documenting such a diverse
region has its own requirements.
"I can't really saywhat a typical
day in the region is like because it
varies so much," Brooks said.. "It
really "'epejds on whereyot are
and what you are doing, but life is
far more diverse than most peo-
ple imagine. Many of my softer
pictures challenge stereotypes."
Brooks's work has covered
events ranging from a Pakistani
fashion week, to the Shiite holi-
day of Ashura, during which Shia
men pay homage to Hussein ibn
Ali through mourning, poetic
recitations and self-flagellation.
Some of her photography shows

the ruinous cityscapes; others
depict a lone individual viewing a
series of bombings from afar.
"Personally, I am more inter-
ested in what happens to civilian
populations than I am in com-
bat," Brooks said.
"I spend a lot of time photo-
graphing daily life in conflict
zones, specifically how people
live in the midst of armed con-
flict," she added.
At a time when the United
States is engaged in affairs with
a region that most Americans
know little about, Brooks believes
it's imperative to increase efforts
of spreading general knowledge
about the region, its people and
its culture.
Brooks's decade-long excur-
sion into the region has been
compiled in her newest book, "In
the Light of Darkness."
"'In the Light of Darkness'
seemed the most fitting (title)
because of my use of light, the
content of my work and the fact
that compassion is an important
element in my photography,"
Brooks said.
The book is a mix of photo-

some personal and some commis-
sioned by various publications,
such as The New Yorker, The
Wall Street Journal and News-
week.
"The collection of photographs
captures people's life experi-
ences, poverty and the violence of

war," Brooks said.
Along with the photos, Brooks
also wrote a series of essays. They
function as a diary, giving atten-
tion to the personal journeys
behind the regional narratives
told by her photographs.
The Author's Forum will be
hosting a conversation Wednes-
day between Brooks and Prof.
Juan Cole, who is the Director of
the Center of Middle Eastern and
North African Studies. The event
takes its name from Brooks's
book and will use the events of
the book as its subject. Cole will
be attempt to put the personal
experiences of Brooks into con-
text.
Having published numerous
works on the culture and poli-
tics of the Middle East, Cole is an
expert on the region. In his book,
"Engaging the Muslim World,"
Cole deals with the West's
"Islamic Anxiety" and the myths
and misinformation that have
given rise to it.
Brooks still travels, attending
events outside her fellowship in
Ann Arbor. This past weekend
she was in Houston attending
the War Photography Exhibit at
the Museum of Fine Arts. While
the residency is only halfway
through, she already has post-
residency plans in the works.
"I care deeply about what's
happening in the Middle East and
I intend to go back after my time
in Ann Arbor," Brooks said.

Though praising and
bashingthe eats in Ann

modus operandi, I'm shifting

first installment of my five-part
Thanksgiving series, we're get-
ting to the meat (Get it?) of the
matter: turkey.
Your first job is to grab a fro-
zen turkey. We're looking for
one about 15 pounds, which - at
approximately pound per per-
son - should comfortably feed
20 people..For the more respon-
sible among us, Eberly Farms'
free-range organic turkeys are
available in most supermarkets.
The cheaper and still delicious
alternative is the classic But-
terball standby. Whatever you
choose, haul the turkey home and
force someone stronger than you
to stow it in the freezer for good
keeping.
On the Monday morning before
Thanksgiving, begin. to thaw
the poultry by placing it in your
refrigerator. If you're cooking a
smaller or larger turkey, adjust
this timeline by remembering
that you need to allow 24 hours of
thawing time per five pounds of
turkey. Assuming you don't have
room in your refrigerator for the
massive bird, you can:
1. Cry on the kitchen floor
as you tweet about your #first-
worldproblems
2. Binge eat everything
3. Move things around until
it fits
Doing all three would also be
accept- able.

I call this a "faux" compound

over, including underneath the

As far as stuffing the turkey,
don't do it. It's often unsafe to
eat dressing cooked in the turkey

way. What we will do is throw a

Through themes of bigotry and

In the small town of Hope

attacked by the half-bat, half-

cave. Consequently, they haul
Bat Boy back to town, where
the sheriff places him under the
care of the local veterinarian, Dr.

 Unfortunately, Dr. Parker grows
increasingly jealous of the atten-

Prosecutors request
death penalty in
Afghan murder case

t'

Accused killer was
an Army sergeant,
killed 16 villagers
JOINT BASE LEWIS-
McCHORD, Wash. (AP) - Army
prosecutors on Tuesday asked an
investigative officer to recom-
mend a death penalty court-mar-
tial for a staff sergeant accused
of killing 16 Afghan villagers in
a predawn rampage, saying that
Staff Sgt. Robert Bales com-
mitted "heinous and despicable
crimes."
Prosecutors.made their closing
arguments after a week of testi-
mony in the preliminary hearing.
Prosecutors say Bales, 39, slipped
away from his remote base at
Camp Belambay in southern
Afghanistan to attack two villag-
es early on March 11. Among the
dead were nine children.
The slayings drew such angry
protests that the U.S. temporar-
ily halted combat operations in
Afghanistan, and it was three
weeks before American inves-
tigators could reach the crime
scenes.
"Terrible, terrible things hap-
pened," said prosecutor Maj. Rob
Stelle. "That is clear."
Stelle cited statements Bales
made after he was apprehended,
saying that they demonstrated
"a clear memory of what he
had done, and consciousness of
wrong-doing."
Several soldiers testified that
Bales returned to the base alone
just before dawn, covered in
blood, and that he made incrimi-
nating statements such as, "I
thought I was doing the right
thing."
An attorney for Bales argued
there's not enough information
to move forward with the court-
martial..
"There are a number of
questions that have not been
answered so far in this investi-
gation," attorney Emma Scan-
lan told the investigating officer

overseeing the preliminary hear-
ing.
Scanlan said that it's still
unknown what Bales' state of
mind was the evening of the kill-
ings.
An Army criminal investiga-
tions command special agent
had testified last week that Bales
tested positive for steroids three
days after the killings, and other
soldiers testified that Bales had
been drinking the evening of the
massacre.
"We've heard that Sgt. Bales
was lucid, coherent and respon-
sive," Scanlan said in her closing
argument. "We don't know what
it means to be on alcohol, ste-
roids and sleeping aids."
The investigating officer said
Tuesday that he would have a
written recommendation by the
end of the week, but that is just
the start of the process. That
recommendation goes next to
the brigade command, and the
ultimate decision would be made
by the three-star general on the
base. There's no clear sense of
how long that could take before
a decision is reached on whether
to proceed to a court-martial
trial.
If a court-martial takes place,
it will be held at Joint Base Lew-
is-McChord, the Washington
state base south of Seattle, and
witnesses will be flown in from
Afghanistan.
The military hasn't executed
a service member since 1961, and'
none of the six men on death row
at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., today
were convicted for atrocities
against foreign civilians. All of
their crimes involved the killing
of U.S. civilians or fellow service
members.
In the most recent high-
profile case at Joint Base Lew-
is-McChord before Bales, the
Army did not seek a death pen-
alty court-martial against five
soldiers accused of killing three
Afghan civilians for sport. In
that case, the ringleader was sen-
tenced to life in prison with pos-

sibility of parole.
Bales faces 16 counts of pre-
meditated murder and six counts
of attempted murder. The pre-
liminary hearing, which began
Nov. 5, included nighttime ses-
sions on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday for the convenience of
the Afghan witnesses. Bales did
not testify.
The witnesses included a
7-year-old girl, who described
how she hid behind her father
when a gunman came to their vil-
lage that night, how the stranger
fired, and how her father died,
cursing in pain and anger.
None of the Afghan witnesses
were able to identify Bales as
the shooter, but other evidence,
includingtests of the blood on his
clothes, implicated him, accord-
ing to testimony from a DNA
expert.
After the hearing concluded,
Scanlan spoke with report-
ers, saying that in addition to
questions about Bales' state of
mind, there are still questions of
whether there were more people
involved.
During testimony, a special
agent testified that months after
the killings, she was able to inter-
view the wife of one of the vic-
tims, who recounted having seen
two U.S. soldiers. Later, however,
the woman's brother-in-law,
Mullah Baraan, who was not
presentat the shootings, testified
that the woman says there was
only one shooter. The woman

creation of The Comprehensive

law passed by Congress in 1980
establishing regulations for
chemical and hazardous waste
management.
McCabe worked for 22 years
in the Environment and Natu-
ral Resources Division of the
U.S. Department of Justice,
and served as Deputy Chief of
the Environmental Enforce-
ment Section from 2001 to
2005.w
Starting in 2005, she served
for sevenyears as Principal Dep-
uty Assistant Administrator of
the EPA's Office of Enforcement
and Compliance Assurance. She
currently serves on the EPA's
Court of Appeals as one of three
judges.
"You are in all sorts of differ-
ent stages," McCabe said. "Won-
dering, A, whether you want a
career in environmental law,
and B, If you want one, how do
you get one."
After tracing her long career
path, McCabe opened the floor
up to questions from the audi-
ence, which included a mix of
first, second and third-year law
students.
Law student Mega Williams
said she came to the seminar to
hear about McCabe's rich expe-
rience in the field.
"I wanted to hear a little bit
more about careers in envi-
ronmental law and I know
that Catherine has had a really
amazing career, or careers, so
that's what I was hoping to hear
about," Williams said.
Because of the recent diffi-
culty law graduates have find-
ing employment, many students
attended to hear more about the
realities of obtaining a job in the
field of environmental law.
Law student Sam Ellingson,
who recently joined the law
school's Environmental Law
Society, said she is concerned
about the competitiveness of the
field.
"I feel like, there is a lim-
ited amount of jobs in the envi-
ronmental sphere in general,"
Ellingson said, adding that she
came to hear advice from
McCabe for law graduates who
want to work in environmental
law.
For students like Ellingson
who are worried about job pros-
pects, McCabe advised students
to create their own opportuni-
ties, as she did.
McCabe pointed out that
students now entering the field
might have more opportunities
since many of her colleagues are
nearing retirement.
"What you have to be is pro-
active," McCabe said. "To be out
there and finding those oppor-
tunities because you don't know
when and where they are going
to come up."

EK 2012 PREVIEW

Blue blossoms early

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's and
women's basketball teams have a
lot in common - they both play
in the newly renovated Crisler
Center, they both have play-
ers that can shoot the lights out
from beyond the arc and they
are both coming off seasons that
ended in berths in the NCAA
Tournament.
But unlike the men's squad,
the women's team lacks the ros-
ter depth that helped earn the
men's team the No. 5 ranking to
the season.
The main reason behind the
women's deficiency is something
that is out of the team's hands -
injuries.
Torn ACL - to be exact.
The bug started early in the
summer when freshman for-
ward Rebecca Lyttle, sopho-
more forward Cyesha Goree and
freshman guard Symone Den-
ham all tore their ACLs.
"Rebecca is not there yet,
but those other two have been
practicing but have been out for.
six months, so obviously their
? conditioning and their touch is
not nearly there," said Michi-
gan coach Kim Barnes Arico on
Oct. 10th. Since then, Goree and
Denham have seen some action
- albeit for 10 minutes of gar-
bage time in the team's exhibi-
tion-game thrashing of Slippery
Rock. In Michigan' s first two
regular-season games, though,
they haven't had any minutes,
and the same holds true with
Lyttle.
While that group continues
to rehab and attempt to get back
to near full-strength, junior
forward Val Driscoll and fresh-
man forward Kelsey Mitchell

The seed was planted with
a smile.

ketball coach Kim Barnes Arico
stood at the podium during Mich-
igan Media Day in October.
With a smile, she answered
questions

and composi- _GARN _
tion. On Women's
With a Basketball
smile, she
answered
questions about the slew of inju-
ries to begin the season and ham-
pered Barnes Arico's capability to
install her a high-tempo offense.
This season had the potential
to become one of the Wolverines'
strongest in recent years, and
Barnes Arico is at the heart of that
opportunity.
The smile - the one you get
when you eat a Zingerman's Reu-
ben or watch videos of kittens on
YouTube - was plastered across
her face. And now that the seed is
planted, she'll have to help it grow.
Barnes Arico has plenty of soil,
water and sunlight to help her first
Michigan team grow. She has a
group of five returning seniors -
three of which return as starters
- to hold her team together. She
also has a core of bench players to
provide the energy to a team that
will grow fast. Led by guard Jenny
Ryan and center Rachel Sheffer,
her squad has the experience to
win close games, like a two-point
loss to Michigan State or a one-
point lossto Iowa last season.
She has her leading point scorer
in Sheffer, and her leader in assists
with Ryan. The two are also her
top two rebounders.
Barnes Arico is also optimistic
because two of Michigan's lead-
ing scorers through two games -
sophomore guard Brenae Harris
and senior guard Kate Thompson
- have unexpectedly stepped up
in the season, even though neither

started a game last season.
With a smile, Barnes Arico
watches her freshman pointguard
adjust to a new style and new level
at the collegiate game. Madison
Ristovski, named Michigan's Miss
Basketball last season for Grosse
Pointe Woods University Ligget,
adds to a loaded group of guards
and may receive a chance to start.
Barnes Arico has a system
designed to take advantage of her
guards, a system that moves fast-
er and allows for more shooting
opportunities. Most importantly,
she has a smile that brings a pres-
ence of never-ending enthusiasm
to a team that watched its former
coach leave for home.
"I always have energy," Barnes
Arcio said. "I told the girls after
the first day, 'You might think this
is the energy that I'm only going
to have on the first day and it's not
going to be here everyday, but this
is who I am and this is how I'll be
every single day.' I think it's really
important that I act the same way
all the time."
But a seed must also endure
flooding rains, the wind and of

course the dreaded squirrels.
The Big Ten flood of talented
teams has rarely been a warm
or hospitable welcome to a new
coach, and will challenge Barnes
Arico early. The wind of a fast,
new system could wear down a
team that will be running up and
down the court more often than
before. Centers like Iowa's Mor-
gan Johnson will dominate in
the post over a lineup that lacks
height. But the seed, with that
smile, is also a reason to be excited
for Michigan. Barnes Arico, in her
16th season, comes from St. Johns
after leading the Red Storm to a
Sweet 16 berth and a24-10 record,
knowinghow to build a program.
And the players are aware of
her record.
"It takes about a half second
to understand that it's a program
that works," Ryan said. "It's a phi-
losophy that works. You can't go
against tradition and history and
stats and that's what the has."
But Barnes Arico still has that
smile now. And as her enthusiasm
grows, your enthusiasm may, too.
It's growing on me at least.

,Breakdown: Guards will lead injury-riddled Michigan roster

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
The 2012 edition of the Michi-
gan's women's basketball team
is small but fast, with an ability
to score from all over the court.
Here's a breakdown of this sea-
son's squad:
GUARDS: Coming into the fall
the starting point guard position
was the most uncertain for the
Wolverines. Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico continuously says
it's "point guard by committee"
for her team, splitting minutes
between senior Jenny Ryan, soph-
omore Brenae Harris and fresh-
man Madison Ristovski.
In the first game of the season
against Detroit, Harris started at
point guard with Ristovski com-
ing off the bench. Ryan is a four-
year starter at the shooting guard
position and looks to be the Wol-
verines' most valuable offensive
asset.
"What I'm trying to do is put
people in their best positions to
be successful," Barnes Arico said.
"Brenae and Madison are both
young kids who haven't experi-
enced the game at the highest
level.

"I don't know if I want to throw
them into the fire so to speak, but
we have Jenny (who) is more expe-
rienced, so we are giving (Harris
and Ristovski) an opportunity to
play the position and kind of get
everything comfortable."
. With the point guard position
still in rotation between Harris
and Ristovski, the Wolverines
have relied on Ryan to help carry
the load.
"I was really impressed when I
was looking over the stats last year
and saw Jenny Ryan's assist to
turnover ratio and she didn't run
the point," Barnes Arico said. "She
always (has) a way to get everyone
involved."
After the three strong guards,
Michigan also has sophomore
Aquashia Anderson and injured
freshman Symone Denham on the
bench.
FORWARDS: The Wolverines
have been plagued by injuries at
the forward position, but senior
Kate Thompson leads the group of
healthy players.
In her first two games as a
starter, she's second on the team
in scoring with 16 points per game
while going 8-for-14 beyond the
arc. Thompson's ability to hit the

Goree and freshman Rebecca Lyt-
tie, both of whom tore their ACLs
over the summer.
Freshman Kelsey Mitchell also
tore her ACL and will not return
this season.
CENTERS: Senior Rachel Shef-
fer leads this group with her
imposing 6-foot-I presence. Shef-
fer - last season's leadingscorer -
is Michigan's best offensive threat.
"I have to get (Rachel) touches
when she's face up," Barnes Arico
said. "I'm not going to go against
the strengths of our team. That's
why in the beginning of (our first)
game we ran a lot of stuff for
Rachel to face up and I think she'll
be a mismatch for some of the
slower, bigger kids.
She is a difference maker, (and)
when the going (gets) tough, she is
ready."
After having just two double-
doubles all of last season, Shef-
fer already has one through two
games.
Behind Sheffer, though, the
Wolverines are thin *at center.
Junior Val Driscoll tore her ACL
over the summer and redshirt
junior Kendra Seto was ruled out
for the season last week for the
same ACL injury.

outside shot has made her an irre-
placeable scorer to the offense.
"Kate Thompson is one of our
best shooters," Barnes Arico said.
"She is (also) really aggressive on
the glass.
"I think because of that she
(has) brought a dimension to our
team that has stood out, and that
is rebounding."

Michigan also looks to sopho-
more starter Nicole Elmblad.
Despite playing guard in high
school, Barnes Arico has played
Elmblad at the small forward posi-
tion because of her rebounding
ability and because of the team's
injuries. Though she's only 5-foot-
11, Elmblad is second on the team
in rebounds with six per game.

After Elmblad, the Wolverines
have seniors Sam Arnold and Nya
Jordan off the bench.
"Sam is one of our biggest post
presence," Barnes Arico said.
"(And) Nya Jordan is probably one
of our most athletic kids. She is a
tremendous rebounder."
The forward position is round-
ed off with sophomore Cyesha

Kovacs wants to make last
Big House memory count

Junior guard Tim Hardaway Jr. paced the Michigan offense against Cleveland State at Crisler Center on Tuesday.
'Michigan atdvances to
New York with blowout

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Editor
Jordan Kovacs is all business.
On Tuesday of senior week,
members of the media had to
pry to get the fifth-year senior
safety to reflect on his time with
the Michigan football team. On
Saturday, he'll play at Michigan
Stadium for the last time. He'll
run out of the tunnel and slap
the 'M Club' banner for the last
time.
But he's still focused on Iowa
- Saturday's visitor who Kovacs
has yet to beat in his Wolverine
career.
"We've had struggles with
them year in, year out," Kovacs
said. "They're a tough football
team, they run the ball down-
hill, and (James) Vandenberg
is a good quarterback, so we're
going to have our hands full.
Obviously you don't want to go
0-4 or 0-S against an opponent,
so I'm hungry."
Kovacs has had a storybook
career. A high school kid from,
Curtis, Ohio with no Division-I
offer, except to be a preferred
walk-on at Toledo, tried out for
the Michigan Wolverines. In his
freshman season, after making
the first cut, he told the train-
ers his knee was bothering him,
and it would eventually require
surgery that had him rehabbing
all year - a football death sen-
tence for somebody with no real
potential.
But a year later, Kovacs start-
ed eight games in his redshirt
freshman season, and over four
years he grew into a captain of
one of the most prestigious foot-
ball institutions in the country.
And Kovacs' ascendance in
the locker room hierarchy has
coincided with the turnaround
of a program that lost its way for
some time. During former coach
Rich Rodriguez's tenure, Michi-
gan skidded through three of

Hardaway scores
game-high17 points
to propel Michigan
to the Big Apple
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Trey Burke celebrated his
20th birthday in style on Mon-
day night, scoring 22 points and
dishing out nine assists in a con-
vincing Michigan win. Tuesday
night, there would be no birthday
hangover.
Burke CLEV. STATE 47
opened the MICHIGAN 77
game with a
break-your-ankles crossover for a
layup.and for the first time in this
early season, the Wolverines took
control from the get-go, jumping
out to a quick 8-0 lead before the
first official timeout.
Cleveland State narrowed its
deficit to 10-7 at the 14:27 mark,
but Michigan responded with
authority, clamping down on the
defensive end and scoring 32 of
the half's final 39 points to take a
commanding 42-14 halftime lead.
The teams traded baskets for
much of the second half, allowing
the Wolverines to win convinc-
ingly, 77-47.
"Our defense was terrific," said
Michigan coach John Beilein.
"It fueled our offense, which
was mostly fast break and really
allowed us to just get out in front

so much that the lead was going
to be hard to overcome, no matter
what Cleveland State did."
With the win, Michigan
advances to the NIT Season Tip-
Off semifinal, which kicks off
next Wednesday in New York
City's Madison Square Garden.
After cruising through the open-
ing two rounds, the Wolverines
are the favorite entering the Big
Apple.
"That was a goal," Beilein said.
"Many of the kids have not been
to New York, they've not been
to the Garden, and we wanted
them to get there ... I'm excited
that this team can go to one of the
most storied places to play bas-
ketball."
Burke and junior guard Tim
Hardaway Jr. led a balanced
first-half Michigan offense that
saw eight different players score.
Hardaway scored 10 points in the
opening stanza and finished with
game-high 17 points. Burke paced
the offense with 12 points and
seven assists.
The Wolverines' impressive
first-half defensive lockdown
can be largely attributed to their
domination on the defensive
glass. Michigan rebounded 20 of
the Vikings' 21 first-half misses
and allowed no second-chance
points.
The freshmen continued their
steady play for the Wolverines.
Guard Nik Stauskas flashed
the impressive shooting that
brought him to Michigan, set-
ting a career-high with 15 points

thanks to 3-of-4 3-point shooting,
while also adding six rebounds -
three-times more than his season
total entering the game.
Stauskas called his 2-for-5
3-point shooting in an exhibition
win over Saginaw Valley State
last week "a bad night."
So how about his 3-for-4 per-
formance?
"I'll take that," he said, laugh-
ing. "I know eventually I'm going
to get my looks. Coach (Beilein)
gave me the confidence to just
keep shooting (and) knock them
down when I can, and my team-
mates are going to find me."
Forward Glenn Robinson
III had a slow shooting night,
connecting on just 2-of-7 from
the field, but he added seven
rebounds. Forward Mitch
McGary made all three of his
field goals for six points and gath-
ered a game-high nine rebounds.
Anton Grady was the only
Viking to score more than six
points. The forward scored 15
points, but was held to just three
rebounds, as Michigan com-
manded the glass, outrebounding
Cleveland State 45-28.
Ten Wolverines scored, as the
bench chipped in with 29 points.
"You just see those guys how
much work they put in in the
offseason - just as much as you
did," Hardaway said. "You see
them going out there and play-
ing their hardest and it's great
because they got that opportu-
nity to come here and play. Hats
off to them. They deserve it."

Going for broke without going broke
By Haley Goldberg

Name: Alexis Christie
Hometown: Grand Rapids, Mich.
School: LSA senior
Concentration: Anthropology
How would you describe your spending habits?
I think that I'm 21 years old and my spending habits tend to
reflect that of a 21-year-old, but I'm also independent of my
parents completely so I'm definitely not throwing down hun-
dreds of dollars at the bar every weekend either.
Do you think being 21has increased your spending?
Originally, yes. The first six months of being 21, definitely. I
could live just off a loaf of bread for groceries so I could have
the extra money going towards going out and now it's like, it's
not worth it. I'd rather eat more than oatmeal for every meal
and go out less. Not to mention just going out and the impact it
has on your schoolwork in general beyond finances.
Do you cook for yourself mostly, or do you find yourself
purchasing food?

Can you break down what you spent your last paycheck
on?
Rent, electric, groceries, I don't think I even went out at all
with my paycheck that time. Yeah, that's it. I work for Ameri-
Corps JumpStart reading program.
When you decide to splurge on going out, what would
you splurge on?
Going out to the bar, but even then most of my friends know
that I am independent and they aren't independent here, so
they are fairly understanding of my situation and (they'll say),
"Hey, I'll buy your drink for you because I know my parents
are paying for my drink and you're paying for your drink inde-
pendently." Even then it's not so hard to go out because the
friends that I do have that aren't independent are understand-
ing, so they're willingto give what they have.
Do you find that you prefer your independent situation?
No. I think it's cool, and it's nice that I'm mature and inde-
pendent and aware of my financial habits. But when it comes

down to it, it would be a whole lot easier if I just wasn't think-
ing about rent and bills and food everyday.
So you're a senior, do you have an idea of where you
want to live after you graduate?
Yeah, I want to live in Philadelphia ... I have siblings that
live in Philadelphia right now so it's a place to crash for free
for a little while. And there's a pretty good bar scene there
and I have a decent amount of bartending skills so I feel
like if anything I can employ that after if I can't find a job
once I graduate. If anything, I can put that to good use even
if I can't put my degree to good use.
Are you concerned about Philadelphia being a more
expensive city to live in?
It is a more expensive city to live in, and yes, it's concern-
ing, but you just get to the point where you think, you're
going to spend a lot of money regardless, so you might as
well live some place where you can be happy. I mean,.I'm
going to be broke no matter what, so I might as well be
broke in Philadelphia.

I definitely cook most of the time.
Like, all of the time. I mean,
throughout the week it's just easy
things like mac n' cheese and
oatmeal that are not necessar-
ily grand meals. Definitely on the
weekend I'll make a little bit of a
meal for myself, like black beans
and rice and quipoa. Something
kind of nutritious.
Do you feel that, compared to
friends that aren't independent,
you have a different percep-
tion when it comes to spending
money?
Definitely. I even discuss this
with my friends who aren't inde-
pendent from their families on a
regular basis because it is just two
different worlds. So for me, money
is constantly on my mind. I mean,
I have to have a job in order to pay.
rent, to get groceries, and there's
weeks when my income is differ-
ent than other weeks. It's always
on my mind and it's an added
stress. But when your parents are
paying for it, of course you have
the stress of thinking about what
you're going to do after college, but
it's not a current concern whereas
for me it definitely is.

too close to call?

very weekend night between11 p.m.
and 4 a.m., BTB rings up more than
500 customers.
"Our motto is fast, fresh and open late,"
General Manager Brent Hegwood said.
"And I always tell my employees that 'fast'
is the first part, so if we aren't fast, that's
a problem."
Hegwood, who is also the manager of
BTB Cantina and Good Time Charley's on
South University Avenue, says his favorite
time of the year is Welcome Week, and it's
obvious why: food sales increase astro-
nomically when students have alcohol
pumping in their systems.
Like any self-respecting Wolverine,
when I drink, I'm going to eat. The geog-
raphy of Ann Arbor's campus confirms my
desires. The warm lights of Pizza House
beckon after a long night at Rick's, the gar-
licky aroma luring in students like moths
to a porch light.
For LSA junior Alexa Shull, eating after-
a night of partying is nearly guaranteed.
Shull said her favorite place to crash is
Pizza House - "feta bread and a peanut
butter Oreo milkshake, definitely," she
said. "I'd probably say three out of five
times I go out, I'll get food."
Shull's friend and LSA sophomore Fed-
erica Jonas follows suit. Jonas goes out
three or four nights a week and often stops
at Jimmy John's or Pizza House afterward
for a personal pizza or a Big John with
cheese.
"I'm just hungry, and I want to eat

something that tastes good," Jonas said.
"Jimmy John's and Pizza House are just
what's open."
There's actually a scientific explanation
for this drink-and-eat behavior. Stuart
Farrimond, a doctor and lecturer in food
and health sciences at Wiltshire College in
the United Kingdom, explained that alco-
hol skews how the brain regulates caloric
intake.
"Alcohol can cause the blood sugar level
to drop, which was presumed to be the
reason for post-drink hunger-pangs," Far-
rimond wrote in an e-mail interview.
Recent research has shown that alco-
hol directly affects the hypothalamus, the
area of our brain that controls the appetite.
So when alcohol binds to receptors on the
brain, the hypothalamus is stimulated, and
that's what causes us to get hungry.
But that doesn't mean you'd want to eata
salad after going out. When we're hungry,
we want something fast and unhealthy.
That's because when alcohol impairs the
brain, our "primitive" survival drive kicks
in and we instinctively want to eat high-
calorie foods, according to Farrimond.
This primitive drive Farrimond is talking
about is the same thing that happens after
a period of fasting, and this makes fatty
foods seem infinitely more attractive.
This makes sense, especially when you
see ravenous students inhaling tacos at
Panchero's at 2 a.m.
And, if Welcome Week got you in the
habit of eating drunk food, it will just get

harder to avoid eating after a night out.
Farrimond said that psychologically, we
tend to repeat positive cycles. Meaning
if you got cheesy bread on the way home
after a lapse in judgment at Necto, you'll
probably do it again.
This isn't promising news, and it gets
worse.
"We can regulate our food intake up to
about one shot of liquor - any more than
that and the appetite goes AWOL," Farri-
mond wrote.
So basically, if you're drunk, there's
little to no chance that your brain will tell
you to control yourself when it comes to
the greasy goodness of late night South
University food.
How to cure a hangover
After a night of house parties or scur-
rying between South U bars, many stu-
dents feel the most common symptoms of a
hangover: an overly achy body and nausea.
For some, late night food stops serve as
a precaution to ward off hangovers. Buy-
ing a fishbowl can automatically mean a
trip afterward to Jimmy John's. Others
swear buy Backroom or the doughy masses
of Pizza House's cheesy bread.
"It tastes really good but it definitely
soaks up the alcohol too," Shull said.
But here's what's happening chemically
as you watch "Friday Night Lights" in bed
for three hours the next morning.
When alcohol enters your body, it breaks

down in several stages, but before it can
be passed through your body, it is broken
down into a highly toxic chemical sub-
stance called acetaldehyde.
Then, the liver processes the acetalde-
hyde into acetic acid, a much less toxic sub-
stance. But, if the liver is overloaded - aka
one too many Jamaican Long Islands - it
can't process everything at once and leads
to that hungover feelingxye know and love.
The rest of this article may contain infor-
mation you wish wasn't true.
Farrimond dismisses urban myths
regarding legends of burrito-curing hang-
overs - food doesn't do anything to sober
you up. He added that even drinking water
isn't going to prevent the impending doom
of a hangover, though it may help relieve
some symptoms - for instance, boosting
the blood sugar level to reduce fatigue.
But some lucky students never feel the
effects, because the liver's ability to cope
with alcohol is completely determined by
our genes, Farrimond said.
So, regardless of how many slices of
NYPD students cram down their throats,
there's not a whole lot they can do except
let their liver slowly process everything.
Cue, hangover.
Though the magical and medicinal
purposes of drunk food may have been
expelled, it still tastes good, and no mat-
ter what students think it's going to do for
them, they'll still buy it.

SNACKER
From Page 5B
As a child who grew up in the middle
-.class, Katai always had a fresh supply of
Goldfish crackers and nachos available
every afternoon after she got home from
school. Now an adult, Katai still treats
herself to snacks on a regular basis
despite not having the same income or
financial acumen that her parents had.
"I was raised middle class, but I did
not graduate into that stratum. What
I graduated into was a world where I
have a drama degree in a recession, and
'that translates firmly into the lower
class," she wrote. "I buy myself snacks
and drinks and dinners in restaurants
because it is a way of pretending that
everything is okay. I know I should be
saving this money, but the deprivation
in all the other ways ... freaks me out and
makes me sad."
Katai experimented with her own
spending and realized that when she
monitored her purchases of food and
drink at restaurants or at the grocery
store, she saved $130 a month, which is
an impressively lower figure from her
average $360 per month food expense.
For Katai - and for many Americans,
she predicts - snacking is a huge income
suck, and is often a way forus to pretend
that we can still spend money even if our
incomes don't exactly allow it.
Little things like crackers and
smoothies don't seem like they are going
to impact our incomes that much. But
then we buy too many of them and look
at our credit card statements.

Less money, more problems
What some students who have help
from their parents or scholarships don't
realize, Tolentino said, is that money is
not an infinite flow.
"If you're the type of person who has
your parents' credit card and you use it
occasionally for birthday dinners or a
pair of winter boots, that's one thing,"
Tolentino said. "But then there's the per-
son with their parents' credit card who
sits online and shops all day."
The ideal vision is that after we grad-
uate, we will instantaneously become
real people, get our acts together and be
responsible with our finances. We will
cook more, eat out less and open retire-
ment accounts.
But Mike Dang, cofounder of The Bill-
fold, said that's not what happens. For
the first few years post graduation, Dang
said people tend to live lifestyles as if we
had the same financial aid and parental
support as we did in college.
"(College students) instantly want to
feel like adults," he said. "A lot of that
has to do with going out and meeting
friends for dinner and drinks and talk-
ing about jobs even if they can't neces-
sarily afford it."
According to information provided
by the University's Career Center, 79.3
percent of LSA students who graduat-
ed in 2010 found jobs that make below
$45,000 a year. A large majority of them
head to big cities such as New York, Chi-
cago and Washington, D.C., where the
cost of living is significantly higher than
that in Ann Arbor.

And keeping up with a similar life-
style as we did in college, according to
Dang, is just not financially viable. The
Internet is filled with tales of twenty-
somethings defaulting on student loans
or filing for bankruptcy after developing
a crippling credit score.
"Parents aren't going to want to sub-
sidize their kids for their whole lives,"
Dang said. "You just can't spend money
in the same ways. Understanding how
debt works is a really important thing."
Tolentino did note, however, that
though graduating can be financially
startling for students, the speed at
which the real world sets in is much less
abrupt than it was a decade ago.
"The transition isn't as sharp as it
used to be," Tolentino said. "A lot of
people have a cushion from their par-
ents and get help now and then."
Take, for example, writer and actress
Lena Dunham (TV's "Girls"), who lived
in her parents' Tribeca loft until she
was 26 after graduating with a liberal
arts degree from Oberlin College in
Ohio.
"I feel like I'm constantly asking (my
parents) to please stay out of my work
life but also to please bring me soup,"
Dunham said in an NPR interview this
year.
Dunham is one of many people in her
age group who have opted to move back
home with her parents. According to a
2010 New York Times Magazine article,
40 percent of people in their 20s decide
to move back temporarily with their
mothers and fathers.
Some students aim to live a more
upscale life upon graduating. Busi-

ness junior Alison Dunbar, who is the
vice president of the Retail and Luxury
Goods Club, said that though she can't
afford to wear all designer clothing as
a student, she aspired to wear more of it
when she got a job.
"It's important to wear better quality
things and dress appropriately as you
get older," Dunbar said.
She went on to describe herself as
"more on the Michael Kors end of luxu-
ry goods" than a "Prada girl."
What is luxury?
As the daughter of an author and an
artist, my perspective on luxury comes
from within my family: my grandmoth-
er.
For the past 40 years, my grandmoth-
er has gone to the salon every Wednes-
day at 10 a.m. to get her hair fluffed
and styled and her nails re-manicured.
I've always felt that this was a luxury.
It's not that I don't care that my roots
have grown out three inches or that I
have more split ends than I can count,
but unlike my grandma, I just don't have
the money to keep up with it.
But I've realized that I do take a
lot of the things I spend money on for
granted, because being able to go out to
dinner every week or buying so much
coffee that my heart races for three
hours is a luxury in itself, even if it feels
necessary or unavoidable.
Dang said habits like mine will need
to change if I don't want to go into debt.
"If it's easy for you to spend more than
you have," he said. "The only option is
to get rid of those temptations."

said the money she uses when she goes out

, I asked four students to tell me how they

sage, the same trends occurred: most of the
ent on food. The two seniors ate out four
ecause of convenience, not having the luxu-
an. And though the two freshmen didn't eat
ecause they lived in the residence halls, on
they would spend between $15 and $20 on

food. Less often, but more money per meal.
Engineering freshman Gregorio Lopez depends almost
entirely on scholarships, so most of his tuition and room
and board is paid for. LSA junior Zach Weber said most
of his money came from a trust fund his parents set up
when he was born, so his tuition is also taken care of. The
only expense that these students were responsible for was
what they ate from day to day.
My situation is similar, in that the bank account I use to
pay for rent, tuition and food is partially supported by my
parents. Though I've had a job since I was 14 and I saved
most of my income for college, my parents cover what my
savings and current income don't.
Like the four students I interviewed, I also spend the
majority of my money on edibles: groceries, a lot of cof-
fee, alcohol and going out to eat with friends. On average,
I spend about $70 a week: $40 on groceries, $20 on coffee
and $10 when I go out to eat with friends.
For me, food is easy to justify as a necessary cost
because when I'm busy and don't have time to cook, I still
need to eat.
But the problem with monitoring my own spending
comes from the fact that my debit cards draw from a pool
of money thatisn'tentirely my own. If I am tight on money,
my parents will help me out.
For instance, I bought coffee four out of five weekdays
the first week of November, which equaled the amount I
spent on food when Iate out. Though I treated myself more
often than I should have, I justified the cost by saying that
this week sucked. But if I were responsible for all of the
costs associated with being financially independent - that
is, monthly rent and utilities, cell phone bills, loan repay-
ments, car insurance, gas and food - I wonder whether I
would have made the same financial decisions as I did.

The Middle Class Snack Kid
Some of the smallest things we buy end up costing us
more money than we anticipate.
Bert's Cafe in the UGLi processes more than 2,000
transactions each day, which includes 250 cups of coffee
and 130 sandwiches per day. We, as students, give Bert's a
weekly revenue of more than $21,000 a week - on coffee
and bagels and sandwiches.
Beanster's locations in Pierpont Commons and the
Michigan League each rake in between $5,500 and $8,000
per week.
Try to think of how you spent your last $100. It goes
away quickly. Over the last few weeks, I spent my last hun-
dred dollars on a ticket to the IASA show, some groceries,
a dinner out and gas.
It's easyto rationalize what we buy, excusing purchases
with phrases like, "Well, I need to eat" or, as Podsiadlik
said, she just didn't have enough time.
When I have free time, any social activity usually
involves money, too - the bars, restaurants, movies. It's
unavoidable.
In an article in The Billfold, Lindsay Katai called this
type of thinking the "Middle Class Snack Kid" mentality.
"'Middle Class Snack Kid' is a term I made up for people
who do not spend a lot on themselves on the whole, but
are running themselves into the ground buying food and
drink," Katai wrote. "As a friend once put it, I am D.T.H.
- Down to Hang. And for me, hanging means snacking."
Lamenting her undying love for snack food, Katai
admitted that the reason she was living paycheck to pay-
check was because she was spending all her money on
Kettle Chips and packaged cookies.
