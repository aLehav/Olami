ANN ARBOR, MI | WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 2021 | MICHIGANDAILY.COM

Four members of the University of 

Michigan’s Board of Regents — half the 

Board — called on Regent Ron Weiser 

(R) to resign in the days following 

his comments at a March 25 North 

Oakland Republican Club meeting, 

during which Weiser called top 

Michigan Democratic lawmakers “the 

three witches” and made references to 

political assassination. 

These comments — likely made in 

reference to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, 

Michigan Attorney General Dana 

Nessel, Michigan Secretary of State 

Jocelyn Benson and two Michigan 

Republican Congressmen who voted 

to impeach former President Donald 

Trump — drew criticism on social 

media from various Regents and 

student groups like the Graduate 

Employees’ Organization. Washtenaw 

County prosecutor Eli Savit also 

criticized Weiser on Twitter, calling 

Weiser’s comments as “misogynistic 

and violent.” 

While Weiser has been the subject 

of criticism from students and faculty 

for months due to his initial response 

to the Jan. 6 attempted insurrection at 

the U.S. Capitol, his role as chairman of 

the Michigan Republican Party and the 

surfacing of inappropriate emails to the 

board, March 26 marked the first time 

other regents explicitly called for his 

resignation or criticized him directly. 

Weiser is one of only two Republican 

regents on the board, joined by Regent 

Sarah Hubbard (R), who was elected to 

the board during the November 2020 

general election. Weiser and Hubbard 

could not be reached for comment in 

time for publication. Regent Katherine 

White (D) could also not be reached.

University President Mark Schlissel 

issued a statement Saturday afternoon 

condemning Weiser’s remarks and 

emphasizing the comments do not 

represent the Board of Regents.

“Such 
words 
are 
particularly 

abhorrent in a climate where so 

recently the use of language has 

engendered violence and attempted 

violence directed at elected officials, 

our 
democratic 
institutions, 
and 

the individuals who guard them,” 

Schlissel’s statement said. “It is never 

appropriate to raise the specter 

of 
assassination 
or 
perpetuate 

misogynistic 
stereotypes 
against 

anyone in any setting. Elected officials 

must adhere to a higher standard 

regardless of the context of their 

remarks.”

The statement also noted regents 

are elected in a statewide ballot and 

recalling a regent would be handled 

by the Michigan Secretary of State’s 

office.

In three March 26 tweets, Regent 

Jordan Acker (D) called on Weiser 

to resign and said his “reckless and 

dangerous language” is not a reflection 

of the University Board of Regents 

and inappropriate following the Jan. 6 

violence at the U.S. capitol. 

“Comments 
about 
removal 
by 

‘assassination’ are a literal attack on 

our Democracy, and are incredibly 

dangerous in light of the January 6th 

insurrection at the Capitol … and the 

FBI-thwarted attacks on our Governor,” 

the tweet reads. “Furthermore, sexist 

language referring to the Governor, 

Attorney General, and Secretary of 

State as ‘witches’ has no place on our 

campus. This language and behavior 

is incompatible with service to the 

University of Michigan.”

Regent Mark Bernstein (D) told 

The Daily in a text message he believes 

Weiser should resign, calling the 

comments “blatantly sexist.”

See WEISER, Page 4

The University of Michigan Board 

of Regents voted to discontinue 

investments in companies engaged in 

oil reserves, oil extraction or thermal-

coal extraction at the March 25 Regents 

meeting. The board also committed 

to a net-zero investment portfolio by 

2050 and approved $140 million of 

new investments in renewable energy 

sources.

The University will no longer 

directly invest in companies that are 

the largest contributors to greenhouse 

gases, which are defined as the top 100 

coal and top 100 oil and gas publicly 

traded companies in the world, as 

compiled by the Carbon Underground 

200 list. The University will also 

discontinue investments into funds 

that have ties to oil reserve depletion or 

extraction. This strategy will be paired 

with investments into infrastructure 

and utilities that support or correlate 

with a transition to a carbon-neutral 

economy.

The vote was unanimous, though 

Regents Katherine White (D) and 

Ron Weiser (R) were not present 

at the meeting. Weiser, who faced 

controversy and calls for his resignation 

in January over his initial response 

to the Capitol insurrection, has yet to 

attend a Regents meeting in 2021.

This vote comes after years of 

sustained activism by community 

members criticizing the University’s 

investments in fossil fuels, and after 

repeated pushback by the University’s 

administration claiming disinvestment 

from fossil fuels would harm the 

University’s financial sustainability. 

By 
making 
the 
commitment 
to 

discontinue investments tied to fossil 

fuels, the University joins other top 

institutions of higher education that 

have made similar commitments like 

the University of California, Brown 

and Columbia. 

The board temporarily froze fossil 

fuel investments in February 2020 and 

studied the issue over the next year 

before pursuing the more aggressive 

approach announced Thursday. 

In its statement, the Climate Action 

Movement, the main group that had 

pushed for divestment, claimed this as 

a “hard-won victory” but criticized the 

long-term divestment approach.

“U-M’s partial divestment and 

commitment 
to 
reinvestment 
in 

renewable energy are crucial steps 

toward 
toppling 
this 
malignant 

industry, and one driven by almost 

a decade of student activism, during 

which the administration arrested 

and charged peaceful students rather 

than meet to address U-M’s inaction 

on climate,” the statement read. 

“However, the lack of a rapid timeline 

for selling its existing fossil fuel 

holdings and continued allowance of 

investments in so-called natural gas is 

utterly unacceptable, at a time when 

we must do everything we can to halt 

all extraction of fossil fuels.”

CAM also criticized the plan for 

continuing 
to 
allow 
endowment 

investment into natural gas, a type of 

fossil fuel, through private equity funds 

and for not addressing the “structural 

deficiencies that led U-M to finance 

such immoral entities in the first 

place.”

“These shortcomings underscore 

the critical need for the implementation 

of basic, ethical guidelines that ensure 

U-M’s investments are not detrimental 

to human rights and for oversight of 

endowment management through the 

establishment of a Standing Committee 

for Responsible Investment (SCRI),” 

the statement read.

UAAO hosts vigil mourning lives lost 
in Atlanta, rise of anti-Asian hate

To crowd of more than 200, speakers talk ending historical context, solidarity

Beneath a cloudy sky at dusk, 

more than 200 people gathered 
in front of the steps of Angell 
Hall Friday to grieve the victims 
of anti-Asian violence in the 
Atlanta area earlier this month 
and reflect on the implications of 
the attack for the Asian American 
community. 

Just over a week after a 21-year-

old white man killed eight people 
in Asian-owned massage parlors 
in Atlanta, the vigil aimed to 
create a space for healing for those 
in the University of Michigan 
community. The vigil, organized 
by the United Asian American 
Organizations, 
an 
umbrella 

organization for campus Asian 
American groups, was also live-
streamed on UAAO’s Facebook. 

Six of the eight victims on 

March 16 were women of Asian 
descent, 
sparking 
discussion 

over 
the 
historical 
violence 

against and fetishization of Asian 
women in Western imperialist 
culture. Since the beginning of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, hate 
crimes against Asian Americans 
have also skyrocketed and anti-
China sentiment has increased. 
According to the Stop AAPI Hate 
Coalition, nearly 3,800 incidents 
of anti-Asian hate have occurred 
since March 2020, 68% of them 
against Asian women.

During the vigil, LSA senior 

and UAAO President Anna Dang 
said it is necessary to consider the 
political climate which enabled 
shooting to happen. From the 
beginning of the pandemic in 
spring 2020, former President 
Donald 
Trump 
frequently 

used anti-Asian rhetoric when 
referring 
to 
the 
coronavirus, 

leading to an increase of online 
hate speech targeted against 
Asian-Americans. 

“And so today, at this vigil, I 

not only grieve, but I am in the 
politics that come with my Asian-
American identity,” Dang said. 

In her speech, Dang also 

highlighted the irony of the vigil’s 
location. 
Former 
University 

President James B. Angell, who 
Angell Hall is named after, helped 
negotiate a treaty that curtailed 
Chinese immigration in the U.S. 
and acted as the precursor to the 
Chinese Exclusion Act. 

“We 
are 
standing 
on 
a 

concrete structure, on stolen 
lands, 
that 
represents 
anti-

Asian violence,” Dang said. “I 
see many parallels between the 
toxicity of (this) historically white 
supremacist institution and the 
white supremacist violence that 
occurred in Atlanta.” 

Dang said the question that is 

on her mind — and should be on 
everyone’s minds — is: “How do 
we stop this violence?” 

Dang 
said 
she 
supports 

abolishing 
institutions 
and 

practices that perpetuate violence, 
like the prison-industrial complex 

and waging war against countries 
deemed “third world.” 

She also again noted the 

political 
rhetoric 
around 
the 

pandemic.

“Racializing a pandemic is 

violence,” Dang said. 

Dang 
cited 
the 
historical 

exclusion and scapegoating of 
Asian Americans as the beginning 
of 
the 
country’s 
tumultuous 

relationship 
with 
people 
of 

Asian descent. The daughter of 
Vietnamese refugees, Dang said 
that her presence at the vigil was 
the result of violent American 
colonialism and imperialism. 

“We 
cannot 
separate 
last 

Tuesday’s loss of life from this 
political call to action,” Dang said. 
“On this campus and at large, 
we need to take our position 
as a responsibility to form an 
abolitionist agenda.”

Frances 
Kai-Hwa 
Wang, 

lecturer in the Department of 
American Culture’s program in 
Asian/Pacific Islander American 
Studies, emphasized this violent 
history by retelling the killing of 
Vincent Chin in Detroit. In 1982, 
Chin, a Chinese American, was 
killed by two white men during 
a night out after they suspected 
him of being Japanese — one of 
the men had recently lost their 
job in auto manufacturing and 
blamed his unemployment on the 
rapid growth of the Japanese car 
industry in the 1970s and 1980s. 

Wang 
said 
the 
lack 
of 

punishment Chin’s killers received 
shows the criminal justice system 
has a history of not recognizing 
violence against Asian Americans. 

“And in the end, (the killers) 

were sentenced to $3,000 fine, 
and three years of probation,” 
Wang said. “To this day, they have 
not not spent a single day in jail.” 

A 
multi-racial 
movement 

formed in response to Chin’s 
death, which expressed outrage 
over the justice system’s handling 
of the case. In Detroit, Chinese 
American journalist Helen Zia 
and others formed the pan-Asian 
American 
civil 
rights 
group 

American Citizens for Justice 
in 1983, shortly after the light 
sentencing of the two men who 
killed Chin. 

Wang 
said 
this 
ethnically 

diverse coalition shows the hope 
that sprung from the tragedy, 
noting 
that 
multiracial 
and 

multiethnic coalitions are still 
very present today to combat 
crisis and violence.

“There’s this amazing project 

called Letters for Black Lives 
where young Asian Americans 
explained Black Lives Matter to 
their elders, and translated it in all 
the different languages so that we 
literally have the words to talk to 
our elders and explain it to them,” 
Wang said.

Wang emphasized that this 

was not just about “one angry, 
young man” who caused the 
deaths in Atlanta. Rather, she said, 
this violence is systemic. Wang 
noted that unemployment, poor 
quality education, lack of access 
to health care and gentrification 

are just some of the many issues 
impacting the most vulnerable 
Asian Americans as well as other 
marginalized groups across the 
country. 

“We need to come together and 

work with social and economic 
justice for all of us,” Wang said. 

LSA senior Anju Jindal-Talib 

spoke at the vigil on how the 
stigmatization of sex work by 
the media and broader culture 
perpetuates 
violence 
against 

marginalized groups, particularly 
Asian women. Certain media 
outlets have equated the massage 
workers to sex work, though 
authorities have not found any 
evidence of sex work in the 
massage 
parlors 
where 
the 

shootings took place. 

However, given the shooter’s 

perceptions of the women as 
sex workers, Jindal-Talib said 
centering the protection of sex 
workers is crucial to ongoing 
conversation.

“The 
assailant 
described 

the attack as eliminating his 
temptations,” 
Jindal-Talib 

said. “Rather than seeking help 
or evaluating his own toxic 
masculinity, the assailant felt 
not only motivated but rightfully 
justified to exercise brutal violence 
against these individuals.” 

Jindal-Talib 
also 
urged 

participants to notice how the 
media 
portrayed 
the 
crime, 

particularly the media’s hesitancy 
to label the killings as a hate crime. 

“There’s been a hyper focus 

on the assailant’s sex addiction 
instead of the interplay of stigma 
around sex work and a racialized 
fetishization of women of color, in 
particular Asian women,” Jindal-
Talib said. 

The fetishization of the victims 

was not limited to the attacker, 
Jindal-Talib 
argued. 
Both 

Aromatherapy Spa and Young’s 
Asian Massage, two spas where 
the shootings took place, have 
more than 200 Google reviews 
including racial slurs and lewd 
comments about the employee’s 
bodies. 

“These comments highlight not 

only white male entitlement but 
how Asian women are eroticized 
and made a vulnerable target for 
violence, especially when they are 
viewed as sex workers,” Jindal-
Talib said.

freshman Owen Scales attended 
the vigil and said the frequency of 
these hate crimes disturbs him.

“I think it’s disgusting that its 

not treated as something that is 
terrorism or a hate crime,” Scales 
said. “(It’s) kind of terrifying how 
numb we kind of grow to it.”

freshman Kate Cummings said 
she attended the vigil in-person 
to offer support to the Asian 
American community.

“I’m here tonight to support 

the AAPI community, not only 
here in Ann Arbor, but nationwide 
and worldwide,” Cummings said. 
“I think that this is a beautiful 
opportunity for us to all come 
together and mourn the loss that 

the families have gone through … 
I think it’s really important that 
we stand beside our AAPI peers 
and band together as a community 
right now more than ever.”

In a Facebook post, State Sen. 

Stephanie Chang, the first Asian 
American woman to be elected 
to the Michigan state legislature, 
wrote that as a University alum 
herself, 
she 
was 
thoroughly 

impressed 
by 
the 
University 

students who organized the vigil.

“Out of the Stop AAPI Hate 

events in Michigan I’ve been to 
so far, their vigil was by far the 
most incredible,” Chang wrote. 
“They covered everything from 
fetishization of AAPI women, 
Vincent Chin, sex worker issues, 
economic inequality, to police 
issues and solidarity with other 
BIPOC communities, had a great 
call and response affirmation, and 
even had a talented vocalist!! All 
within about an hour.”

Artistic 
expressions 
of 

mourning 
and 
hope 
were 

provided 
by 
performers 
like 

Music, Theater & Dance junior 
Helen Shen who sang “Someday” 
from “The Hunchback of Notre 
Dame.” Later in the evening, 
Music, Theater & Dance senior 
Levana Wang read poetry from 
University alum Carlina Duan’s “I 
Wore My Blackest Hair.” Ending 
the vigil were Music, Theater & 
Dance seniors Erica Ito and Thani 
Brant, who performed Bob Dylan’s 
“Blowing in the Wind.” 

LSA junior Natalie Suh spoke 

at the vigil about how the violence 
in Atlanta flooded her with a lot of 
different emotions. 

“This violence brought up my 

own experiences with racism, 
sexism and fetishization of Asian 
American 
women,” 
Suh 
said. 

“So if you’re feeling emotionally 
or 
physically 
tired, 
or 
too 

overwhelmed to even think about 
yourself this week, we see you.” 

Suh 
also 
stressed 
the 

importance of learning about the 
lives of the victims. 

“They 
were 
mothers, 

grandmothers, daughters, friends, 
wives, 
co-workers, 
neighbors, 

maybe 
even 
regulars 
at 
a 

restaurant or a market,” Suh said. 

UAAO 
is 
still 
collecting 

donations 
to 
distribute 
to 

community 
organizations 
and 

the victims’ families through @
uaao_2021 on Venmo. According 
to Dang, they hope to keep 
coalition-building and “existing 
through resistance” with these 
donations. 

To conclude her speech, Wang 

said to the audience that those who 
identify as Asian American should 
embrace their identity and push 
back against Anti-Asian rhetoric 
amidst the Atlanta tragedy. 

“There is power in calling 

ourselves 
Asian 
Americans,” 

Wang said. “We are Americans. 
We belong here.”

Public Health junior Nithya 

Arun and Engineering junior 
Carla 
Voigt 
will 
serve 
as 

president and vice president 
of the University of Michigan 
Central Student Government’s 
11th Assembly, according to the 
student government elections 
preliminary results. The pair 
received 1,574 out of the 3,067 
votes that were cast, according 
to preliminary election results 
obtained by The Daily.

Arun and Voigt ran with the 

IMPACT party, which endorsed 
candidates 
in 
representative 

elections for nine schools. Their 
platform had nine policy areas 
which 
included 
initiatives 

that 
addressed 
anti-racism, 

health and wellness as well as 
affordability and accessibility.

Both Arun and Voigt have 

been involved with CSG since 
their freshman year. Arun has 
served as a policy advisor for 
the past two years, while Voigt 
filled a vacancy as Speaker of the 
Assembly in Fall 2020 after the 
previous speaker was removed 
from the position. 

Following notification of their 

victory, Arun and Voigt thanked 
voters and the candidates who 
ran with them in a statement to 
The Daily.

“After the many challenges 

our campus has faced during 
this time we are incredibly 
grateful for the opportunity to 
represent the student body,” 
their 
statement 
read. 
“This 

would not have been possible 
without the immense support 
we have received from our 
friends and the entire Michigan 
community. Thank you to all 

of the candidates who ran. We 
acknowledge that this campaign 
season was contentious, but your 
passion and will to represent 
your fellow students was nothing 
short of inspiring. We are so 
excited to serve, advocate, and 
affect change with the student 
body.”

This 
victory 
comes 
after 

controversy with the ORGANIZE 
party’s 
vice 
presidential 

candidate Sam Burnstein, LSA 
junior, resulted in his resignation 
from the race hours before 
voting began. Burnstein dropped 
out after tweets from 2017 he had 
liked — that included included 
xenophobic, anti-immigrant and 
anti-Muslim rhetoric — surfaced 
the 
day 
before 
elections. 

Burnstein’s running mate, LSA 
junior Sujin Kim, ran alone as 
the presidential candidate on the 
ORGANIZE executive ticket and 
came in second place with 1,384 
votes. 

Due to rules surrounding 

when the ballot could be edited, 
Burnstein’s name continued to 
appear next to Kim’s on the ticket 
throughout voting even though 
he had officially announced his 
departure from the race by the 
time it began. 

Despite 
the 
ORGANIZE 

executive 
ticket 
losing, 

candidates for the Assembly were 
elected across both campaigns. 
In a statement to The Daily, the 
ORGANIZE campaign thanked 
their supporters and said they 
are proud of the coalition of 
campus activist organizations 
and students they built and look 
forward to continuing to work 
with them.

“We want to thank everyone 

for believing in our collective 
potential, and for dedicating so 
much of their lives over the last 

few weeks to working towards 
making 
it 
a 
reality,” 
their 

statement read. “Though we 
are of course disappointed that 
the results were not what we’d 
hoped for, we are proud of our 
team, and we are proud of what 
we have accomplished together.”

With 241 votes, LSA juniors 

Abner Santiago and Nicole Lin 
from the CHANGE party came 
in third place and ran without 
endorsing a representative slate 
of candidates for the Assembly. 
Santiago and Lin did not respond 
to 
The 
Daily’s 
request 
for 

comment in time for publication.

Along with voting for an 

executive ticket, students also 
selected 
representatives 
for 

their respective colleges: 15 for 
LSA, seven for Rackham, six for 
College of Engineering, three 
for the Business School and one 
for each of the remaining 14 
colleges. Party affiliations were 
not listed on the representative 
ballots and some candidates 
were not endorsed by IMPACT 
or ORGANIZE.

Approximately 
6.5% 
of 

students voted in the University-
wide election, which could be 
accessed online by all students. 
This percentage was an increase 
from 5% in 2020, but a decrease 

from the 11.9% who voted in 
2019.

During the CSG presidential 

debate, Arun said she will work 
hard throughout her tenure 
as president and live up to her 
campaign promises to make 
the 
University 
an 
equitable 

community.

“I cannot wait to start working 

on a large fund to help students 
meet daily expenses, subsidize 
grocery delivery subscriptions 
and increase funding to SAPAC, 
among 
many, 
many 
other 

things,” Arun said at the debate. 
“Put simply, I cannot wait to 
impact Michigan.”

During the vice presidential 

debate, Voigt said while the 
student body will continue to be 
confronted with challenges, she 
and Arun are ready to fight for 
the students.

“The problems before the 

student body are complex and 
multi dimensional, the legacy of 
an IMPACT administration then 
will be the building of an army 
of students that works hand in 
hand to overcome any and all 
challenges,” Voigt said.

Law School Dean 
publicly apologizes 

for anti-Asian 

racist book covers

ACADEMICS

Apology comes three years after one 
student first advocated for change

When University of Michigan 

Law student Courtney Liss first 
sat down in the Robert B. Aikens 
Commons for orientation, she said 
she listened eagerly as Law School 
Dean Mark West, professor of 
Japanese law, was introduced to the 
incoming class. 

As West formally welcomed 

Liss and her peers to one of the 
most prestigious law programs in 
the country, out of curiosity, Liss 
pulled out her phone and looked 
up West’s published academic 
works. Liss, who identifies as mixed 
Vietnamese, said she was shocked 
to see the covers of his books 
portraying 
sexually 
suggestive 

representations of Asian women.

“I personally have been haunted 

by these book covers and this very 
visible example of racism since I 
came to the University of Michigan 
Law,” Liss said. “Literally, sitting in 
orientation, I remember pulling up 
his work and looking at them and 
being like, ‘What? How did I end up 
here?’”

Asian women have long been 

fetishized and hyper-sexualized in 
Western culture. The sexualization 
of Asian American women — and 
the anti-Asian racism inherent in 
these stereotypes — gained national 
attention last week when eight 
people, including four women of 
Korean descent and two of Chinese 
descent, were killed in mass 
shootings at Asian-owned massage 
parlors in the Atlanta area.

Now in her third year at the 

University, Liss said she has 
privately contacted Law School 
administrators 
throughout 
her 

three years about the covers while 
publicly advocating for West to take 
responsibility for them. So when 
West released an email statement 
March 17 on behalf of the Law 
School condemning the Atlanta 
shooting, Liss decided to tweet 
about West’s book covers. 

Liss’s tweets led to pushback 

against 
West 
throughout 
the 

Michigan Law community. Three 
days after her tweet, West issued a 
formal apology for the book covers 
in an email sent out to the Michigan 
Law community and obtained by 
The Daily.

“(The book covers) reinforces 

a view of women founded on 
damaging stereotypes,” West wrote 
in his March 20 apology. “And while 
contributing to a harmful narrative 
was not my intent or understanding 
at the time, I understand it now, and 
I understand that my intent does not 
excuse or lessen the harm.”

When contacted for comment 

on 
West’s 
apology, 
University 

spokeswoman Kim Broekhuizen 
sent The Daily University President 
Mark Schissel’s March 17 statement 
in response to the spa shootings as 
well a statement from Rob Sellers, 

chief diversity officer and vice 
provost for equity and inclusion.

In his March 20 apology, West 

acknowledged 
that 
his 
work 

hurt members of the University 
community. 
West 
announced 

the publisher of one of his books, 
“Secrets, Sex, and Spectacle,” has 
removed the cover photograph from 
their website as of March 20. West 
said he is actively working with 
his publishers to amend the other 
covers as well.

In an email to The Daily, West 

said academic publishers rarely 
make these sorts of changes to 
previously 
published 
work 
on 

account of author requests.

“I 
had 
many 
conversations 

regarding 
deletion 
of 
existing 

artwork and replacement with new 
artwork,” West wrote. “I am pleased 
to share that two publishers have 
responded by changing the covers.”

In December 2020, West was 

named the inaugural David A. 
Breach Dean of Law after a $5 
million gift from the Breach 
family established the position. 
Pending the Board of Regents’ 
approval, West intends to work for 
the remainder of his deanship to 
support new racial justice initiatives 
at the Law School.

In his apology email, West said 

as “one in a position of leadership,” 
he regrets not considering the 
harmful effects the cover images 
might have on Asian American 
communities. West admitted that 
he was questioned by students 
about the juxtaposition between his 
public denunciation of the Atlanta 
attacks and his book covers in the 
days between his two statements. 

Liss said she emailed West on 

June 6, 2020 for a variety of reasons, 
including the book covers.

“Over the last two years, I 

have mentioned that these book 
covers make me uncomfortable to 
(the Asian Pacific American Law 
Students Association), to (several 
law deans), to many professors, both 
tenured and non-tenured,” Liss 
wrote to West in her email, a copy of 
which was shared with The Daily. 
“Many of them knew and looked at 
me awkwardly and guiltily … many 
of them didn’t know and expressed 
honest shock.”

After Liss’s June email, West 

arranged a Zoom meeting with 
Liss and two other Deans on June 
10. At the meeting, Liss said when 
she challenged West about the 
book covers, he conceded that the 
photographic cover of “Secrets, Sex, 
and Spectacle” could be considered 
offensive and personally apoligized 
to her. Liss said West defended the 
other contested covers and said they 
were reprints of famous Japanese 
art. West did not specifically 
comment on Liss’s description of 
the June 10 meeting when asked by 
The Daily.

New Ann Arbor city ordinance would ease student housing hunt

Every August, Ann Arbor is 

filled with a rush of commotion 
as students return to campus. 
Moving trucks line the inner 
streets, 
and 
students 
begin 

the tedious process of lugging 
mattresses up steep flights of 
stairs and turning a house into a 
home for the year. 

Yet not even three months after 

settling in, many students begin 
the hunt for the next August-
to- August lease cycle. Students, 
though sometimes unsure of what 
their living situation will look like 
for the next year, often sign leases 
simply to ensure that they’ll have a 
place to stay on or near campus — 
sometimes with people they aren’t 
friends with one year later. 

Ann Arbor’s city ordinance — 

established in 2006 — currently 
requires that landlords wait 70 
days after tenants sign their lease 
before 
showing 
the 
property 

to others or asking the current 
tenants if they want to sign 
again. For most students, this 
means if their lease begins in 
August, their landlord can begin 
searching for tenants for the next 
year starting in late October. This 
practice continued even during 
the COVID-19 pandemic last fall, 
when some students were forced 
to sign leases without knowing 
whether classes next year would 
be online or in-person.

To alleviate rampant student 

frustration 
with 
the 
Ann 

Arbor student housing market, 
the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization 
has 
been 

collaborating with Ann Arbor 
City Councilmember Elizabeth 
Nelson, D-Ward 4, in hopes of 
implementing a new ordinance 
that requires landlords to wait at 
least 240 days before signing or 
showing a property for the next 
year.

Rackham student and GEO 

secretary Amir Fleischmann said 
his landlord approached him in 

early November asking him to 
resign his lease, putting him in a 
difficult position of resigning for 
convenience or having to search 
all over again for a place to live. 

“I ended up not wanting to be in 

that apartment for the following 
year, and it was not possible for me 
to get out of them,” Fleischmann 
said. 

Most 
undergraduate 
and 

graduate students sign a lease 
without 
knowing 
what 
their 

plans are for the coming year, 
Fleischmann said. Some students 
decide to travel abroad or take 
the semester off to pursue an 
internship later on in the school 
year, leaving students bound to a 
lease regardless of if they decide to 
reside in the house.

“This forces tenants to make a 

commitment that is very difficult 
to get out of, and it puts a lot of 
pressure on people who really do 
not know where they’re going to 
be that far in advance, and it forces 
people to make difficult decisions 
that they’re really not prepared to 
make at that time,” Fleischmann 
said. “As this current ordinance 
stands, it gives landlords legal 
license to bully tenants into 
resigning their lease before they’re 
ready.”

Rackham 
student 
Ember 

McCoy said she has experienced 
problems every year with the 
housing market since she first 
moved to Ann Arbor for her 
master’s degree. In the six years 
of living in Ann Arbor, McCoy 
said she has been approached five 
times by landlords asking her to 
renew her lease in October. 

After their lease started in 

August 2020, McCoy said she and 
her sister were approached by 
their landlord on Oct. 19, which 
was before the 70-day ordinance 
currently in place and thus illegal. 
McCoy said she was asked to renew 
her lease, notified of an increase in 
rent and given five days to decide if 
she and her sister would be living 
there the following year. 

McCoy said her sister was in the 

process of applying to graduate 

school and was uncertain if she 
would be staying in Ann Arbor for 
the following year. The pair did not 
see the email from their landlord 
when it was first sent out five days 
earlier, and when they opened the 
email, they realized they had 24 
hours to make a decision. 

“We just needed more time,” 

McCoy said. “They gave us 24 
hours, and obviously nothing 
changed about our circumstance 
within 24 hours, and so they 
signed our lease to someone else 
the first week of November for 
August 2021 to 2022. That was the 
first time I was hurt by the system. 
I had known this was an issue and 
it was always really frustrating to 
me, but this is the first time that I 
was personally impacted by it.”

Nelson, who said she has never 

experienced the Ann Arbor rental 
market, said she was unaware 
of the 70-day ordinance before 
GEO asked for her help. Because 
an 
ordinance 
already 
exists, 

Nelson said the next step would 
be to introduce a resolution or 
ordinance amendment for a City 
Council vote.

“When I read the (current) 

ordinance, I realized we actually 
took a stab at creating a timeline 
and it was pitifully short,” Nelson 
said. 

Nelson said the city is legally 

allowed to restrict the time period 
that landlords have to wait before 
showing a property, making this 
proposal possible. 

Nelson said she has met with 

the city staff in charge of enforcing 
rental 
regulations 
and 
found 

that the current ordinance is not 
heavily regulated. No one has 
been taken to court or questioned 
about their violations, Nelson 
said. At most, the city has received 
phone calls from tenants reporting 
their landlords for violating the 
ordinance, but landlords are rarely 
held responsible, Nelson said. 

“The reason there hasn’t been 

any 
meaningful 
enforcement 

probably is because the standard 
is so low that we’ve kind of set the 
bar so that everybody can easily 

meet (the 70-day limit), there’s 
little temptation to follow (the 
current ordinance) because (70 
days) already is such a low bar,” 
Nelson said. 

Nelson said this issue involves 

finding a balance between both 
the landlords and their tenants, 
both of whom have stake in 
the 
housing 
market. 
Nelson 

said she is collaborating with 
city coordinators to determine 
the limits of the possible new 
ordinance and how to enforce it.

“This is one of these situations 

where 
we’re 
balancing 
the 

interests of the person who owns 
the property, and the person who 
is renting the property,” Nelson 
said. “If we passed a regulation 
that said the landlord can’t show 
the property and can’t even ask for 
renewal until 24 hours before the 
end of the term of the lease, that 
would be indefensible because a 
property owner could argue (that) 
we had made it impossible for 
them to use their property.” 

Nelson said she met with a 

landlord who rents out one house 
in Ann Arbor who said that she 
never feels the need to harass 
her tenants because the market 
is hot, making her confident she 
can eventually find a student who 
will be interested in renting the 
property. 

A different landlord, Margaret 

Wyzlic, marketing manager of 
Oxford Companies, said that if 
the number of days required to 
re-lease changes, they will adhere 
to the days and continue to respect 
the city of Ann Arbor’s leasing 
regulations. 

“If that number changes it 

would give students more time to 
make a decision,” Wyzlic said, “I 
think that’s kind of integral to the 
idea of extending the time frame, 
which (…) depending on what 
person you are in the equation 
may have benefits or drawbacks.. 
We’re just really happy to support 
whatever decision is made.”

As vaccines are becoming 

more 
and 
more 
accessible, 

Michigan Medicine has been 
a key distributor responsible 
for vaccinating hospital staff 
and patients as well as some 
students and faculty in Ann 
Arbor. Each week, the number 
of vaccines available nationally 
varies, which influences the 
supply chain and ultimately 
how many doses local health 
systems have access to.

Michigan 
Medicine 
has 

the capacity to vaccinate up 
to 
24,000 
individuals 
per 

week. However, the amount 
of 
vaccinations 
actually 

distributed each week depends 
on 
the 
amount 
of 
doses 

allocated to Michigan Medicine 
by the state, according to Mary 
Masson, 
Michigan 
Medicine 

director of public relations. 

“Michigan 
Medicine 
does 

not order a specific amount of 
vaccine doses from the state of 
Michigan, the state determines 
how much to distribute to us,” 
Masson wrote in an email. 
“If our supply of vaccines 
increases, we could do 12,000 
doses per week and ramp up to 
20,000. During this week, the 
week of March 15, we received 
enough vaccines to open 4,400 
first-dose appointments.”

The University of Michigan 

has been vaccinating through 
the Michigan Medicine system 
since 
vaccines 
were 
first 

made available in the state 
in 
December 
2020. 
Marisa 

Eisenberg, University associate 
professor 
of 
epidemiology 

complex systems and math, 
explained the federal and state 
tiers of the vaccine distribution 
pipeline.

“The way that (the vaccine 

pipeline) works is that there’s 
a federal allocation and the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 

Health and Human services 
puts in orders each week to 
the federal system,” Eisenberg 
said. “There’s been a shift in 
the way that the state has been 
distributing vaccines, so it was 
initially more heavily relying 
on hospital systems, and then 
to try to make more equitable 
vaccine 
distribution, 
they 

shifted towards a more local 
health department based model 
and using pharmacies.”

Eisenberg 
said 
the 
way 

vaccines are chosen to be 
distributed to regions is based 
on 
the 
social 
vulnerability 

index, which is a percentile 
used by the Centers for Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention 
to 

determine the vulnerability of 
communities to stresses that 
negatively impact health. As of 
2016, Washtenaw county had 
an SVI score of 0.2557, which 
indicates 
low 
to 
moderate 

vulnerability. However, areas 
of the county with more Black 
and 
Latinx 
residents 
have 

lower SVI scores compared 
to other areas, so the county 
health department set up pop-
up vaccination clinics earlier in 
the month specifically focusing 
on these communities.

According 
to 
Masson, 

Michigan Medicine spent a few 

weeks allocating their doses 
to patients who had already 
received 
their 
first 
doses, 

since the Pfizer and Moderna 
vaccines require two doses 
spaced 3 or 4 weeks apart for 
maximum immunity. This is 
what caused previous pauses 
in 
first-dose 
appointments, 

though 
recently 
Michigan 

Medicine has been receiving 
enough weekly doses to resume 
first-dose appointments.

“We have continued to offer 

vaccine clinics weekly, although 
we had some weeks where we 
couldn’t offer new first-dose 
appointments 
because 
we 

didn’t have the vaccine supply,” 
Masson wrote. “We continue 
to work with other health 
care systems, our local health 
departments, and the state on 
distribution.”

Eisenberg works on the state’s 

COVID-19 response and focuses 
on infectious disease modeling. 
She echoed Masson and said the 
decreased availability of first-
dose appointments at Michigan 
Medicine is due to delays in 
vaccine supply. 

“The reason for Michigan 

Medicine’s pause is that they 
just haven’t been getting much 
in the way of supply,” Eisenberg 
said. “And so for a while, I know 
that they were really mostly just 
focusing on finishing out second 
doses from the people who 
they had already gotten first 
doses for, and so that, I think, 
reasonably they shifted back 
towards doing more first doses 
again. I think they finished up 
that round of second doses and 
then, now they’re starting to get 

rolling on first doses again.”

Susan 
Ringler-Cerniglia, 

the Washtenaw County Health 
Department public information 
officer, discussed the process 
of receiving and requesting 
vaccines for the county as a 
whole. 

“We only provide a request 

number for the second doses 
we need each week,” Ringler-
Cerniglia said. “Then, we take 
everything that is available to 
us, so (there is) zero decision 
making. 
Our 
doses 
come 

through 
the 
state 
health 

department 
(MDHHS). 
The 

state allocates vaccine supplies 
to local health departments and 
health systems/hospitals.”

LSA senior Sabrina Corsetti is 

involved in COVID-19 modeling 

research. She believes that 
vaccine opportunities as well 
as students having a positive 
mindset going into the Fall 
2021 semester is critical for 
having a return to normalcy in 
the fall. 

“I know that the University 

was initially concerned that 
they might not be able to 
vaccinate students until really 
the fall,” Corsetti said. “But 
since supply has been ramping 
up, I think there is a lot more 
optimism 
about 
vaccinating 

students sooner.” 

Once supply of vaccines is 

stabilized, Corsetti said she 
thinks the University should 
focus on ensuring that vaccine 
distribution for students is a 
safe and easy process.

“So obviously, a lot of it is 

supply 
dependent, 
making 

sure that you know the most 
vulnerable 
populations 
are 

vaccinated … prior to just the 
general student population,” 
Corsetti said. “I think a lot of 
it comes down to making sure 
that 
we 
minimize 
vaccine 

hesitancy 
in 
the 
student 

population. I think that once 
the supply is taken care of, just 
making sure that students feel 
comfortable and safe going and 
getting it and also publicizing 
where they can go to get the

“Regent 
Ron 
Weiser’s 

comments 
are 
dangerous, 

disgusting 
and 
damaging 
to 

our state and the University of 
Michigan,” Bernstein wrote. “His 
reference to Governor Whitmer, 
Attorney General Nessel and 
Secretary of State Benson as 
“the three witches” is blatantly 
sexist. Suggesting that the work 
of a political party should enable 
‘burning’ these three women ‘at 
the stake’ is even worse.”

Bernstein wrote that Weiser’s 

reference to the “assassination” 
of members of Congress in the 
context of political rhetoric has no 
place in society.

“This isn’t and shouldn’t be a 

partisan issue,” Bernstein wrote. 
“It’s 
about 
rejecting 
violent, 

reckless rhetoric.” 

Bernstein 
added 
that 
the 

regents’ job is to be responsible 
stewards of the University — a 
responsibility he does not believe 
Weiser has fulfilled.

“In doing so we must protect 

democracy, honor public service 
and 
support 
our 
students,” 

Bernstein wrote. “Regent Weiser 
has failed to do so. Our University 
and the people of this state deserve 
better. He should resign.”

Regent Mike Behm (D) told 

The Daily in a phone interview 
he would ask Weiser to resign. 
Behm said he found the misogyny 
of 
Weiser’s 
statements 
about 

Whitmer, Nessel and Benson 
alarming.

“Misogyny has no place in 

our society and is antithetical to 
his role as a Regent, and also to 
the mission of the University of 

Michigan,” Behm said.

Behm added that he thought 

a publicly elected official should 
never use the word “assassination” 
in a speech.

Asked why he thought Regents 

were 
just 
speaking 
against 

Weiser now despite months of 
calls from many in the campus 
community for his resignation, 
Behm 
said 
Weiser’s 
January 

oral surgery could have been a 
factor in the remarks where he 
claimed ignorance of the Capitol 
insurrection.

“(March 25’s speech) is quite 

different from that,” Behm said. 
“Those were planned remarks in 
front of a group of people.”

Regent Paul Brown (D) called 

on Weiser to resign in a March 27 
text message to The Daily and said 
the comments were “misogynistic, 
divisive and reckless.”

“I was sickened to see the 

Republican State Party Chair 
refer to our state’s three highest 
elected officials, and my friends, 
as “witches” to be “burned at the 
stake,” and for the audience to 
cheer in support,” Brown wrote. 
“These statements are at odds with 
everything this great University, 
our state, our country and good 
people hold sacred. Degrading 
and inflammatory speech by any 
public official is inexcusable and 
should not be tolerated by good 
people.” 

Brown added that he was 

saddened to have to condemn 
Weiser, 
noting 
Weiser’s 

contributions 
to 
Michigan 

Medicine that have “saved lives 
and will save countless more in 
the future.”

“Although we hold different 

political 
beliefs, 
I’ve 
known 

Regent 
Weiser 
to 
be 
an 

exceptional regent, completely 
dedicated to the University and 
its noble mission,” Brown wrote. 
“I know Regent Weiser loves the 
University of Michigan. He has 
been extremely generous to the 
University’s three campuses and 
hospital.”

Brown said he believes in 

redemption and forgiveness, and 
so hoped the initial reports of 
the comments were inaccurate or 
that Weiser would release “a since 
apology.”

“Disappointingly, I have since 

learned that the reporting is 
accurate and Regent Weiser’s 
follow up statement is anything 
but an apology,” Brown wrote. 
“So, particularly at this moment 
in our history when such extreme 
rhetoric from too many political 
leaders has sewn deep division 
in society, hurt individuals, and 
threatened our democracy, I can 
only come to the conclusion that 
any official, including Regent 
Weiser, who would unrepentantly 
engage in such speech should 
not remain in public office, 
especially at an institution like the 
University of Michigan, which so 
values upholding gender equality 
and protection of women’s rights.”

Regent 
Denise 
Ilitch 
(D), 

chair of the Board of Regents, 
condemned Weiser’s comments 
but stopped short of calling for 
his resignation in an email to The 
Daily.

“Despite 
any 
differences 

among 
its 
eight 
members 

elected by the State’s voters, we 
have worked constructively on 
advancing the institution without 
destructive politics getting in 
the way,” Ilitch wrote. “That is 
why it is so disturbing to learn 
of the repugnant language used 

by a member of our Board when 
addressing a political group. His 
use of violent imagery crosses 
a line that is inconsistent with 
what should be our shared values. 
There should be no place for 
physical threats by elected or 
political leaders on our Board or 
in our State.”

Prior 
to 
Acker, 
Bernstein 

and Behm and Brown’s calls 
for resignation, in a phone call 
with 
The 
Daily, 
University 

spokesperson 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 

said the University is aware of 
the reports of March 25’s North 
Oakland Republican Club meeting 
but declined to comment on any of 
Weiser’s comments.

Weiser was not at March 25’s 

Regents meeting — and has not 
attended a single meeting in 
2021— but Fitzgerald dismissed 
any 
criticism 
of 
Weiser’s 

attendance at meetings being 
unusual. Fitzgerald said Regents 
have 
conflicts 
with 
Board 

meetings from “time to time,” and 
noted Regent Katherine White 
(D) has also missed the last two 
meetings. 

“Those conflicts often collide 

with each other and those things 
are sort of inevitable,” Fitzgerald 
said. 

A source close to the Board 

told 
The 
Daily 
that 
Weiser 

was at Michigan Republican 
Party Headquarters during the 
February Board meeting, and 
Weiser said March 25 that he was 
recruiting a Republican candidate 
for Michigan State University’s 
Board of Trustees during the 
March 25 meeting.

Behm said Weiser has “not 

been engaged” on the Board since 
January, pointing to his absence at 
both of the Board’s 2021 meetings.

“He has been less engaged on 

the Board, and so I don’t know 
if he will remain on the Board in 
name only or not,” Behm said.

Behm added that he was able 

to attend March 25’s meetings all 
day despite being out of town.

“That’s what you sign up to 

do when you run for the Board,” 
Behm said.

Weiser said he would not resign 

from the Board in a statement 
posted to Twitter March 26.

“I made some comments that 

are clearly being taken out of 
context,” Weiser wrote. “While 
I should have chosen my words 
more 
carefully, 
anyone 
who 

knows me understands I would 
never advocate for violence…. I 
will not be resigning from the 
University of Michigan, and our 
focus at the Michigan Republican 
Party remains the same—winning 
in 2022.“

 The Michigan Democratic 

Party released a statement calling 
on Weiser to resign from the 
Board of Regents on March 26, 
saying Weiser’s comments are not 
appropriate for his elected office. 

“As a member of the University 

of Michigan’s Board of Regents, 
he oversees millions of taxpayer 
dollars,” Michigan Democratic 
Party Chair Lavora Barnes said 
in the statement. “It’s clear his 
comments do not reflect the 
values of the university’s board, 
faculty, and student body. His 
statements are not only sexist but 
markedly dangerous and will only 
serve to damage the institution’s 
reputation.”

State Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann 

Arbor, also called for Weiser’s 
resignation in a tweet March 27.

“Ron Weiser should resign,” 

Irwin’s tweet said. “His recent 

statements are an embarrassment 
to the University and a danger 
to our liberal democracy. The 
University of Michigan deserves 
better.”

Whitmer responded to Weiser 

in a tweet with a quote from 
author Lindy West. 

“For a long time, a certain set 

of men have called women like me 
‘witches’ to silence and discredit 
us,” Whitmer’s tweet said.

A 
spokesperson 
for 
the 

Michigan 
Department 
of 

State 
labeled 
the 
comments 

“horrifically 
reckless 
and 

unconscionable,” in light of the 
October plot to kidnap Whitmer 
and the Jan. 6 violence at the U.S. 
capitol. 

“Secretary Benson and her 

colleagues 
have 
experienced 

firsthand how this rhetoric is 
later used as justification for 
very real threats made against 
government 
officials, 
election 

administrators and democracy 
itself,” the statement reads. “Any 
leader who does not resoundingly 
denounce this kind of behavior 
and attitude is complicit in their 
silence. If we’re ever going to be 
able to move forward and begin 
solving the problems facing the 
people of this state in a bipartisan 
manner, comments like this need 
to stop.”

This article has been updated 

to include comments from various 
regents, University President Mark 
Schlissel and other public officials 
released after the article’s initial 
publication.

Regent 
Jordan 
Acker 
(D) 

addressed students after the 
announcement was made. Acker 
praised student activists for 
their diligence in pushing the 
University to move towards 
divestment, 
saying 
activism 

on this matter has made the 
University a better place and he 
was “proud to vote yes” on the 
effort. 

“Likely, there are moments 

that you felt that you were 
yelling into the void about the 
most important issue of our 
generation, the threat of climate 
change,” 
Acker 
said. 
“Your 

activism matters. Your voice 
matters. Your passion matters. 
And 
yes, 
your 
viewpoint 

matters.”

Later, Acker tweeted that the 

$140 million in carbon neutral 
investments was a “good start,” 

and that the University “should 
and will do much more.”

The University’s commitment 

to a net zero endowment is 
the first from an American 
public 
university, 
Regent 

Mark Bernstein (D) said at the 
meeting. 

“It’s been said that we are 

the first generation to feel 
the effects of climate change, 
and the last generation that 
can do something about it,” 
Bernstein said. “This is a big 
and complicated problem, and 
the University of Michigan is 
in the business of solving big 
complicated 
consequential 

problems; leaders don’t shy away 
from hard challenges. We must 
do this, as President Kennedy 
once said about a different 
daunting challenge, ‘We have to 
do this not because it is easy, but 
because it is hard.’” 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel said the University 
is committed to this shift in 

investments, which can be seen 
through the magnitude of the 
$140 million investment.

“So make no mistake, we’re 

serious about the change in 
direction,” Schlissel said. “This 
strategy is informed by the 
growing risk of investments in 
fossil fuels during the essential 
transition to a lower carbon 
economy.”

The board approved three 

separate investments totalling 
up to $140 million, with the first 
being a $30 million investment 
to renewable energy projects 
from D.E. Shaw, an investment 
firm. 

Schlissel provided specific 

details into the $140 million 
the 
University 
will 
invest 

in renewables. Later in the 
meeting, The Board of Regents 
approved 
the 
investment 

requests unanimously. 

“U-M will shift its natural 

resources 
investment 
focus 

away 
from 
oil 
extraction 

reserves 
toward 
renewable 

energy investments with an 
attractive risk adjusted return 
profile,” Schlissel said. “We 
also will pursue infrastructure 
and 
services 
investments 

that 
support 
more 
efficient 

resource utilization, as well as 
investments into other emerging 
technologies 
that 
support 

the 
transition 
to 
a 
carbon 

neutral economy. The research 
investments 
into 
renewable 

energy 
and 
sustainable 

infrastructure development will 
be presented shortly for a vote of 
the board.”

University 
Chief 
Financial 

Officer 
Kevin 
Hagerty 
said 

the University would be the 
only endowment investor in 
the fund, as D.E. Shaw has not 
historically pursued foundations 
or endowments as investors.

“We think we will be able 

to help this manager identify 
technological 
improvements 

over time, creating additional 

upside for both the endowment 
and the environments,” Hagerty 
said. 

Hagerty 
also 
requested 

the committal of $50 million 
to an investment firm called 
Aplomado Partners. Aplomado 
is an investment manager that 
works with solar developers to 
help maximize their efficiency 
in utility solar projects.

“Working 
with 
Aplomado 

allows solar developers to use 
their time and capital much 
more efficiently, which enables 
solar projects to be built far 
more quickly than is typical,” 
Hagerty said.

The Board then approved a 

commitment of up to $60 million, 
from the University’s long term 
investment portfolio, to Cresta 
Sustainable 
Infrastructure. 

Cresta Fund Management, a firm 
based in Dallas that focuses on 
infrastructure, 
transportation 

and sequestration, is an existing 
U-M investment manager.

“The 
fund 
has 
a 
broad 

investment scope, all of which 
is focused on developing energy 
transition 
strategies 
and 

technologies, and sustainable 
infrastructure,” Hagerty said. 
“We anticipate, for example, 
that the first two projects the 
fund will actually make will be 
a renewable gas project, and a 
carbon sequestration project.”

The President’s Commission 

on Carbon Neutrality released 
one week prior a series of 50 
recommendations to move the 
University 
towards 
complete 

carbon neutrality in the coming 
decades. Schlissel said March 25 
he will announce action on the 
items in the coming months.

Wednesday, March 31, 2021 — 5

When I first sought out to 

understand 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s students’ experiences with 
guilty pleasures, I expected to find an 
underbelly of U-M students dumping 
their parents’ credit cards into VTuber 
donations or OnlyFans subscriptions.

After seeing my post looking 

for interviews about the topic on 
Facebook, a close friend messaged 
me, “I do feel like I need to turn on a 
private Spotify listening session when 
I listen to Drake LOL.”

I responded back, “c’mon, DRAKE, 

who’s gonna bully you for that?”

Drake is one of the most popular 

artists of all time, I thought. What could 
be guilty about that? But as I began to 
ask more friends about guilty pleasures, 
I got more and more seemingly 
mundane answers. “The Bachelor,” 
a powerhouse media franchise with 
enormous cultural impact, was a 
common response. So was country 
music, an extremely popular genre. 
Not that obscurity makes something 
guilty — but if it’s something that 
makes you feel embarrassed, it couldn’t 
be mainstream, right?

“I’m thinking to myself, ‘I should 

not be enjoying this right now.’”

Engineering 
freshman 
Tom 

Sherman is talking about Taylor Swift. 
Swift just won her third Album of the 
Year for folklore at the Grammys and 
ranks in the top 10 best-selling artists 
of all time.

“I’m sure when you looked at me, 

you weren’t thinking, ‘oh my gosh, he’s 
like, (a) Taylor Swift fan right here,’” 
he said.

Sherman was right — I wasn’t 

expecting his guilty pleasure to be 
Taylor Swift. But that was because 
I was expecting something more 
… unexpected, like a shoujo manga 
obsession or a Bella Thorne OnlyFans 
subscription. If he were a writer for 
Daily Arts, liking Taylor Swift would 
practically be a prerequisite. As we 
began to talk about it a little more, 
though, I started to better understand 
why it might be a guilty pleasure for 
him.

“When I was rushing fraternities, 

I wasn’t advertising it there … 
Judgment is part of school. I rushed, 
and I applied to all these clubs this 
past semester,” Sherman said. “The 
reality is, there’s a lot of times when 
there’s a certain number of spots, 
and not enough room. And if you say 

something that is a little off-putting to 
one person, it could cost you.”

Listening to Sherman’s experience, 

I began to recall my own time as a 
freshman at the University doing 
my best to get involved on campus. 
In my first semester, I applied to 
five consulting clubs, all of which 
denied me after stressful interviews. 
I also attended the mass meeting for 
a business fraternity that I walked out 
of halfway through, in tears on my 
way home from the League.

The pressure to impress people 

was so terrifying for me that I couldn’t 
share a shred of my personality. At the 
root of it? A gnawing fear that my (very 
mainstream) interests were lame.

That I wasn’t what people were 

looking for. And in that context, I 
understand how Sherman’s Taylor 
Swift addiction is one that he preferred 
to keep on the down-low during rush.

To Sherman, it was his male 

identity that made him feel guilty for 
liking Taylor Swift so much. I could 
see how in the judgmental context of 
rush and club recruiting, Swift could 
suddenly feel like too feminine of an 
interest to celebrate. 

“I think the only reason it is a 

guilty pleasure is because of my 
demographic,” he said. “If I was 

different, it wouldn’t be a guilty 
pleasure. It would just be a pleasure.”

Sherman’s experience felt tied to 

the pressure of fitting a masculine 
image or narrative. When he felt 
comfortable with his own enjoyment 
of Taylor Swift, he happily shared it 
with some friends. It was in certain 
campus contexts that he felt hesitant 
to open up about it.

But what about the guilty pleasures 

that genuinely feel like a moral 
compromise to enjoy?

LSA senior Isabel Saville described 

her first guilty pleasure, fantasy novels 
and worldbuilding, similarly to how 
Sherman spoke about Taylor Swift — 
just something you enjoy that you feel 
hesitant to tell some of your friends 
about. Her other guilty pleasure is 
more complicated.

“I think that one (guilty pleasure) 

that I would feel shame for no matter 
what is music that’s derogatory 
towards women,” Saville said. “When 
you’re working out or you’re in a group 
setting and you’re listening to music 
that’s like, ‘fuck bitches,’ you know, it 
just feels bad.” Saville cited Tyler, the 
Creator’s early music (full of violent 
and abusive lyrics, often directed 
toward women) as an example of 
music that felt guilty to enjoy: “That is 

a guilty pleasure, because I don’t like 
what it perpetuates about me.”

Saville’s experience can’t be 

uncommon. Sexism in music is so 
pervasive, and often swept under 
the rug — it’s not as if men are 
privately enjoying lines like, “If she’s 
sucking on the barrel, you can’t hear 
her scream,” from Ameer Vann on 
“HEAT” by BROCKHAMPTON. 
Frankly, I have the song on all my 
party-hosting playlists and never 
thought twice about who I play it 
around, or what it means that I enjoy 
it so much. I didn’t even notice the 
line until Saville quoted it in our 
conversation.

“It’s emotionally draining to hear 

things like that and notice them, 
recognize them and have to work 
through them,” she explained. 

For myself and other men, 

listening to music tinged with 
sexism rarely requires turning your 
brain off to enjoy. The casual “fuck 
bitches” lines are still practically 
invisible for me, although in the 
last couple of years, I’ve begun to 
feel shame for some songs I used 
to enjoy. I’d find myself listening to 
tracks like “Xxplosive” by Dr. Dre 
and doing a double-take at sexist 
lyrics that are so heinous they make 

Ameer Vann’s edgiest lines sound 
PG-rated.

There are two sides of shame 

that come with both enjoying and 
recognizing 
problematic 
music. 

Internally there is shame for 
enjoying it, but there can also be 
external shame for voicing that 
discomfort. Despite Ann Arbor’s 
self-proclaimed wokeness, trying 
to open a dialogue isn’t always 
welcomed with open arms in 
Saville’s experience.

“It’s always really annoying when 

I try to enter conversations with 
friends who are like, ‘you’re just 
being the progressive feminist all 
the time,’” Saville said. “It’s just like, 
‘you all say you’re feminists too! And 
I know you support equality.’”

Paraphrasing 
one 
of 
her 

professors, Saville explained, “The 
music we listen to perpetuates 
cultural norms and ideas, so it’s 
important to listen to things that 
echo how you feel.” I share that 
sentiment — it’s the dissonance 
between the music we listen to and 
how it makes us feel that can make 
for a guilty pleasure.

When I was 11, I walked out of 

the mall with the complete box set 
of the first season of “Glee” on DVD. 
I had begged my mom to buy it for 
me for months. She was reluctant, 
not only because of the price (you 
can get them now for less than $10 at 
Walmart, but back then it cost closer 
to $50) but because she’d heard about 
the show and thought it might not be 
appropriate for an 11-year-old. It took 
some cajoling, and I think I remember 
something about a promise that I 
would stop watching if anything 
inappropriate happened, but as I 
walked back to the car with the DVD 
case tucked under my arm, I was 
already half in love with “Glee” solely 
because of the anticipation I’d built up 
for it in my head.

As it turns out, I didn’t so much 

love “Glee” as I did attach a piece 
of my soul to its first three seasons. 
Aside from being the source of my 
love for musical theatre, the source 
of my gay awakening and the only 
reason I know all the words to Black 
Kids’s “I’m Not Gonna Teach Your 
Boyfriend How to Dance with You,” 

it was also my gateway into fandom, 
something which has taken up more 
space in my brain than I’ll ever be 
comfortable admitting.

When you’re young and you think 

you might be gay and the internet 
is still fun and not totally awful, 
wanting to engage with other fans 
online is inevitable. In 2010, it was 
almost impossible to be young, gay, 
online and not on Tumblr, the nucleus 
of all fandom activity at the time. 
I was impressionable and excited 
and overwhelmed by the amount of 
content that was already there when 
I joined. Especially when “Glee” 
started to go off the rails, it was a place 
where people could yell with — or 
at — each other about it, where users 
wrote fanfiction that changed painful 
canonical endings, where fans took to 
Photoshop to create hyper-realistic 
edits of their favorite couples.

The longer “Glee” dragged on, the 

more entrenched in the fandom I 
became. It’s hard to describe exactly 
how in it I was, but it was probably to an 
unhealthy degree. I wholeheartedly 
engaged in the online discourse. My 
love of reading became applicable 
almost exclusively to fanfiction. The 
way that a storyline played out for my 
favorite character Santana (played by 

the late Naya Rivera) in an episode 
could drastically alter my mood for 
better or for worse.

But as much as I loved the show, as 

much as I sometimes felt like I could 
burst from my love for it, nearly all 
of my feelings were contained to the 
internet. Fandom was taboo and liking 
“Glee” had certain social implications. 
There was an overlap there as well. 

The queerness of “Glee” is obvious, 

but the inherent queerness of fandom 
shouldn’t be understated. The online 
spaces that I occupied were almost 
entirely queer, loving and working 
off of the gay relationships “Glee” 
depicted 
(primarily 
Klaine 
and 

Brittana), but also pairing straight 
characters together in romantic gay 
relationships and creating hoards of 
content about them.

Thousands 
of 
queer 
people 

have used fandom, in part, as wish 
fulfillment. When I first got involved, 
the state of gay issues in the United 
States was in a strange, in-between 
place. Acceptance was growing, but 
gay marriage hadn’t been legalized yet. 

Everyone was starved for validation, 

and we projected our identities onto 
characters we loved. This was not only 
applicable to “Glee” or other shows 
with explicitly queer characters but 

also to intensely heterosexual shows 
like “Supernatural,” “Teen Wolf” and 
“Sherlock.” The gay pairings Destiel, 
Sterek and Johnlock were completely 
fanmade, 
the 
results 
of 
rather 

egregious instances of queerbaiting, 
but that didn’t keep them from 
becoming some of the most popular 
relationships across fandoms.

For me, fandom, queerness, secrecy 

and shame were intertwined. I never 
felt guilty for loving “Glee,” but I felt 
incredibly guilty about how much 
I loved it and the ways in which I 
expressed that love. How could I 
possibly explain how much of my 
personal happiness was contingent 
upon how certain characters were 
treated on a TV show? I didn’t want to 
answer all of the questions that could 
come with any offer of an explanation, 
because I knew it could reveal a part 
of myself that I wasn’t ready for other 
people to see.

My friends knew that I really liked 

“Glee,” but I never told them how 
Finn outing Santana had sent me 
reeling for days. I put an innocuous 
slushie sticker on my binder and saved 
a lot of the music to my playlists, but I 
never let anyone in my real life know 
the true extent of my deep emotional 
investment in the show. I loved the 

fandom, the creativity that it inspired 
in people and the space it gave me 
to express that creativity freely, but 
I still read all fanfiction in a private 
tab, never saved any bookmarks and 
was careful to log out of my Tumblr 
account after I was done scrolling 
through my dashboard.

Things are sort of different 

now. Fandom no longer resides 
in a shadowy place that the light 
doesn’t touch. We’ve entered a 
time in which “Euphoria” directly 
references not just fanfiction, but 
the cultural phenomenon that was 
Larry Stylinson. Celebrities and 
YouTubers make videos reading and 
recreating fanfiction written about 
them. Hollywood makes successful 
franchises out of “Twilight” smut. 
The ubiquity of big franchises and 
the way that they not only allow but 
encourage fans to speculate about and 
create around them has done a lot to 
normalize letting entertainment take 
up more brain space than it should. 
What’s more, us once content-starved 
girls and gays have grown up, become 
self-aware and moved onto different 
social media platforms. We love to 
make fun of ourselves, the media we 
used to consume and the way we used 
to consume it.

Admittedly, I’ve never totally 

fallen out of fandom. After half of the 
characters (all the good ones, really) 
graduated at the end of season three, 
I fell out of love with “Glee,” but my 
dependence on the comfort of an 
online community and the content it 
created remained. For a while, I felt 
like I had been cut adrift; I floated 
from fandom to fandom, trying to 
figure out where I might feel the 
same intense love and care for a single 
thing again. I still haven’t loved a TV 
show, movie or character in the same 
way (and that’s probably for the best), 
but that three-year obsession is the 
reason Tumblr is still downloaded on 
my phone and the reason I still read 
fanfiction when I’m bored.

With those old tendencies, some of 

the old shame still lingers. There’s a 
recognition that fandom exists, but it’s 
still sort of tucked away in the corner 
of pop culture. 

The fact that people care about 

fictional characters and worlds so 
much that they write novel-length 
fanfiction about them or create 
museum-worthy art is still thought of 
as strange.

There’s only one way to describe 

The Hunger Games series: explosive. 
Never, in my 19 years, have I read 
books so thrilling, fast-paced and 
addictive. There are bone-chilling 
horrors, swoon-worthy love interests 
and immersive action. To this day, I 
have yet to read a sequel better than 
“Catching Fire” (some might argue 
that “The Hunger Games” was simply 
the set-up for the second book, and I 
would agree). It’s genuinely ridiculous 
how enthralling the series is. The 
Hunger Games books are my guilty 
pleasure … but the more I read them, 
the more I realize they critique the very 
idea of a “guilty pleasure.” 

I can talk about The Hunger 

Games for hours. In fact, I did over 
winter break. Embarrassingly, I fell 
back into my middle-school passion 
— I reread the books and bothered my 
older brother and a good friend into 
rewatching the movies with me. They 
nodded along awkwardly, trying to 
pay attention to the screen while I gave 
them a steady stream of commentary 
filled with movie trivia and Reddit fan 

theories. (I’m sorry, Ashvin and Julia.) 

All of this is to say, I (and many 

others) find the series binge-worthy. 
The sheer brutality of the story alone 
makes it impossible to stop reading. 
The extremely popular yet skeptically 
viewed series details the duration and 
aftermath of the 74th annual televised 
Hunger Games, where children from 
the 12 impoverished Districts are 
forced to murder each other for the 
Capitol’s entertainment.

When the series first gained 

popularity, I remember quizzes titled 
“What Hunger Games District Are 
You From?” would pop up online, with 
questions like “Do you like to swim?” 
or “Are you popular?” that, when 
answered, placed readers in districts 
based on their supposed personalities. 
While fun at the time, these quizzes are 
the antithesis of The Hunger Games. 
The characters in the series don’t get 
to choose their education, career or life 
— they don’t get the luxury of deciding 
their fate. Most readers of The Hunger 
Games, despite identifying emotionally 
with Katniss Everdeen’s story, cannot 
relate to the struggles of the Districts.

It’s easy to hate the Capitol, the 

prosperous governing city that puts 
on the Games. Within the story, it’s 

clear the Capitol is the enemy. The 
Capitol (including the Gamemakers 
and government) watches the brutal 
Games indifferently while choosing 
tributes to support, viewing them as no 
more human than a beloved TV show 
character or player in a video game. 
They binge-watch the Hunger Games 
like it’s lowbrow entertainment — their 
“connections” to the tributes are trivial. 

Upon rereading the series, it’s 

apparent that we, the readers, are the 
Capitol. We can’t look away from the 
story because its descriptions of love 
and suffering entrance us. We watch 
with nervousness and anticipation, 
rooting for our favorite characters to 
win, mesmerized by the danger and 
action. We marvel at the descriptions 
of rich districts while bristling with 
discomfort and surface-level sympathy 
when reading about the abject poverty 
Katniss, our protagonist, experiences. 
We romanticize their stories, ignoring 
the barely included details of genuine 
hardship. Our guilty pleasure is 
consuming their pain. 

The Capitol’s adoration of Katniss’s 

romantic relationships can easily be 
compared to our society’s obsession 
with the love triangle between Katniss 
Everdeen, Peeta Mellark and Gale 
Hawthorne (Peeta forever!). The 
author, Suzanne Collins, has stated 
in interviews that the romance is 
supposed to be indicative of Katniss’s 
worldview: Peeta symbolizes hope and 
diplomacy, and Gale represents violent 
and efficient solutions. 

However, the often quoted “The 

Death of the Author” piece by Roland 
Barthes comes to mind — truly, it is 
the critic’s job to interpret a work of 
art. Therefore, if someone views The 
Hunger Games as a tale of romance, 
that is their right as a critic, and it’s a 
valid interpretation. 

One of the most unexpectedly 

delightful moments of my high school 
career occurred in my senior year 
Advanced Placement Biology class. 
The class was a collection of friendly 
acquaintances who inevitably bonded 
while staring at paramecium, cutting 
sheep brains into slices and not 
understanding what the Calvin Cycle 
was. It was during one of our grueling 
weekly one-and-a-half-hour block 
periods when it happened. I don’t 
remember the context well, much like 
I don’t remember most of the material 
from that class. What I do remember 
is someone (or maybe multiple people) 
quietly and inexplicably breaking out 
into the opening lyrics of Usher’s 2004 
hit “Yeah!”: “Yeah, yeah, yeah … yeah, 
yeah … ” 

And in a completely unplanned 

moment, a large percentage of our 
20-person class quietly chimed in with 
the last and most emphasized word of 
the phrase: “Yeah.” Incredible stuff.

As we broke out into peals of 

laughter, I couldn’t help but think that 
there was some level of significance to 
that moment. Despite the years that 
had passed since “Yeah!” had last been 
relevant, this group of very different 
people were able to recall the (albeit 
very simple) lyrics. It made me think 
of all of the other songs, terrible or 
otherwise, that have stuck with me 
from when I was growing up. Thus, 
my “Bops for 12-year-old Me” playlist 
was born.

I’ll admit, the playlist’s title is a bit of 

a misnomer — the songs are from many 
different points in my adolescence, 
from the songs I passively heard on the 
radio that embedded themselves into 
my head to the Top 100 hits that the 
DJ played at my middle school dances. 
Even if I was a toddler when they came 
out, they’re songs that I remember 
from some context or another growing 
up. This collection of nearly 300 songs, 
for better or for worse, is part of my 

childhood landscape — everything 
from Rihanna to Sean Kingston to 
Katy Perry to, say, the High School 
Musical soundtracks. So why do I feel 
so embarrassed listening to it? 

When I first made the playlist, I 

was oddly gleeful about it. Maybe it’s 
because songs like Iyaz’s “Replay” or 
Fergie’s “Fergalicious” make me laugh 
even as I find myself singing along 
to every word. But after the initial 
playlist-creation rush wore off, I found 
myself in an awkward situation: How 
do I justify listening to these songs? 

In a world where art seems to 

always be focused on “what’s next,” 
it seems harder to justify consuming 
music that is a decade past its prime. 
Maybe it’s the sensory associations, 
or maybe it’s just the distinctive 2000s 
music production, but there is a special 
slice of music that people my age link 
to that kind of nostalgia.

In all honesty, some of the titular 

“bops” are songs that I didn’t like 
much when they came out, but they 
still managed to form such an indelible 
impression on me that I had to include 
them. Others I legitimately love to the 
point that if they came out in 2021, I 
would unironically listen to them all 

the time, guilt-free.

But listening to music associated 

with the big names of 2000s pop and 
R&B comes with an odd sort of risk. 
Clearly, this playlist is not universal 
— “Bops for 12-year-old Me” is based 
around my childhood, tailored to 
my memories of the 2000s and early 
2010s. There may be overlaps, but 
not every song will slot perfectly into 
someone else’s experience the way it 
does into mine.

Because of this, there are moments 

when I am painfully aware that the 
songs from my childhood might not 
elicit the same reactions from others — 
there’s something uniquely awkward 
about putting a playlist on shuffle and 
having someone say, “I hate this song.” 
Every time I offer to take the aux cord 
and play “Bops” I find myself making 
the same caveat: “If you ever want me 
to skip a song, just let me know, and 
I’ll skip it.” It’s easily my most popular 
playlist: I have 13 followers, some of 
whom are probably strangers, and one 
of my friends told me once that she 
listens to it while she codes.

“Sag Harbor” by Colson 

Whitehead — Recommended by 

Daily Arts Writer Trina Pal 

“Sag 
Harbor” 
isn’t 
Colson 

Whitehead’s most well-known novel. 
“The Underground Railroad” or “The 
Nickel Boys” would take those titles. 
Yet, the light charm of “Sag Harbor” 
makes it my favorite among all of 

Whitehead’s books. “Sag Harbor” 
follows a group of Black teenagers 
at their summer retreat in Sag 
Harbor, Long Island, adjacent to the 
wealthy, predominantly-white East 
Hamptons. The plot is lighthearted 
and airy, but Whitehead’s writing 
is razor-sharp. Most of all, the 
novel is just plain funny. Read “Sag 
Harbor” this spring for a glimpse of 
Whitehead’s more comedic but no less 
adept work. 

“For Black Girls Like Me” by 

Mariama J. Lockington —
Recommended by Daily Arts 

Writer Lilly Pearce

Mariama J. Lockington’s debut 

novel is a heartbreaking novel told 
from the perspective of Makeda, 
a young, adopted, Black girl who 
struggles with her identity. It’s an 
important story that tackles racism 
and mental illness, while also 
exploring the complex and powerful 
relationships between families and 
friends. Lockington incorporates 
several styles of writing — prose, 
poetry and letters — that create 
layered 
dynamics 
between 
the 

characters and helps demonstrate 
the complexity of discovering who 
you are. While targeted toward 
young readers, people of all ages will 
be captivated by this coming-of-age 
story — it’s a poetic rendition of an 
essential tale.

“Beyond Survival: Strategies and 

Stories from the Transformative 

Justice Movement” — 

Recommended by Daily Arts 

Contributor Brenna Goss

“Beyond Survival” is a collection 

of essays by a variety of organizers, 
activists and authors of color that lays 
out the steps we must take to replace 
punitive mass incarceration with 
community-based 
transformative 

and restorative justice practices. It’s an 
incredibly important read for anyone 
interested in racial justice, criminal 
justice, public health and safety. 

“Homie” by Danez Smith — 

Recommended by Daily Arts 

Writer Lilly Pearce

“Homie” is Danez Smith’s latest 

collection of poems, a radiant array 
of themes that involve remarkable 
explorations of friendship and grief 

to thunderous examinations of the 
violence and xenophobia that infect 
our nation. Within these themes lie 
other corporeal narratives that touch 
on race, queerness and illness. Smith 
crafts beautiful intersects between 
their poems that result in a perfect 
constellation of poetry. It’s the kind 
of book meant to be read again and 
again, shared among friends and held 
close. “Homie” is a profound work of 
love that Smith easily achieves with 
their unparalleled language and craft. 

“Dread Nation” by Justina 

Ireland — Recommended by Daily 
Book Review Beat Editor Elizabeth 

Yoon

“Dread 
Nation,” 
by 
Justina 

Ireland 
seamlessly 
incorporates 

zombies into U.S. history, spinning 
a believably complex, exciting and 
honest story of two girls caught in 
an absurd reality. While the U.S. 
is divided fighting the Civil War, 
the zombie apocalypse begins. To 
address the growing number of 
deaths, the U.S. drafts the “Native 
and Negro Reeducation Act” to 
train 
children 
as 
bodyguards 

for the wealthy. Beyond being a 
fantastically addictive read, Ireland 
tackles complex identity issues 
with great asexual and bisexual 
representation. 

“A Song of Wraiths and 

Ruin” by Roseanne A. Brown 
— Recommended by Daily Arts 

Contributor Brenna Goss

Roseanne 
A. 
Brown’s 
novel 

is a wonderful YA book filled 

with magic, myth, tragedy and 
redemption. Both of the main 
characters are captivating in their 
own right and even more so together 
— even though they’re both trying 
to kill each other. Brown created 
a beautifully written narrative 
filled with West African folklore, 
adventure and a thrilling battle of 
wits. It will keep you glued to the 
page until the very end.

6 — Wednesday, March 31, 2021 

About a month ago a friend of 

mine recommended — or dare I say 
passionately coaxed me into finding 
— an artist who “I would love”: Lily 
Talmers. Indeed, I loved her — so much 
so that last Friday I had the pleasure of 
sitting down with her to talk about her 
latest album release, Remember Me As 
Holy, which came out Feb. 11 and has 
since been the soundtrack of my life. 

It is now my turn to expose you to 

the talent of this 24-year-old, Ann 
Arbor-based, Birmingham, Mich.-
born and University alum singer-
songwriter who writes from the 
warmest corners of her heart and the 
coldest places of her mind. 

I am not sure if it was the cover art 

that drew me in, reminiscent of other 
great records with nostalgic childhood 
pictures such as Big Thief’s Capacity 
or Angelo de Augustine’s “Time,” or 
the first note of the song “Maybe It’s 
Madness,” but when I researched 
Talmers for the first time I stopped 
everything I was doing to delve into 
her 12-song LP. 

I began listening to track after track, 

reading all the lyrics along the way. I 
embarked on a voyage of oscillating 
emotions: I cried with “Francis,” 
gasped at “Middle of America,” stared 
blankly at the wall in disbelief during 
“No Woman,” replayed “Into the Air” 
six times in a row and stopped to take 
a break with “The Push and Pull of It.” 
My poor heart! 

A style of songwriting evocative 

of Joni Mitchell and a mode of 
storytelling as beautiful as Leonard 
Cohen’s, Talmers considers herself 
to have been influenced by the sonic 
quality of many 60s artists. Her second 
studio album is an ode to her roots in 
folk music, roots she said she respects 
so much she wouldn’t dare seek to 

ever emulate them authentically, but 
ones which certainly live within her 
nonetheless. 

I was interested in finding out the 

meaning behind the record’s title, 
Remember Me As Holy, which is a line 
in the song “Francis.” 

“It’s being scared that you affect 

people and that they have memories of 
you that you can no longer control and 
wanting to control those memories 
like a form of love,” Talmer told me in 
her sit-down interview with The Daily. 
“If you’re no longer in someone’s life, 
for whatever reason, at least there’s 
hope to be remembered as something 
good.” 

Her words expressed a vulnerability 

of thought which stung while at the 
same time dampened my mouth with a 
sweet taste — such a wondrous notion 
had never before crossed my mind. 

Just about a year after releasing 

her first LP, Temple Down, Talmers 
describes Remember Me As Holy 
as being “more self-aware and at 
the same time more accepting of me 
leaning into production, as a mode of 
artistic expression.” 

Talmers pointed out that she is 

somewhat afraid of recording her 
songs because pinning them down 
means they’re not breathing anymore. 

However, when embarking on the 

journey of recording this album, which 
began in October 2020, Talmers was 
sure of the people she wanted to work 
with. The record was co-produced 
by University of Michigan alumni 
Geoff Brown and Ian Eylanbekov 
and mastered by Elie Curtis, who 
is currently in the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance. Brown also did 
the mixing and engineering and 
Eylanbekov, along with Ben Green and 
David Ward (from the band “Sabbatical 
Bob”), handled the instrumentals. 

I was that kid who collected rocks 

and sticks on the playground and 
made magical potions out of leaves 
in my backyard. Even now as a full-
grown adult, it’s still on my bucket list 
to stumble upon a fairy circle.

Recently, I discovered that there 

are aesthetics that embrace this love 
for nature and desire for simplicity. 
However, I also discovered that there 
are a myriad of problems with these 
aesthetics and their communities.

“Cottagecore” is an aesthetic — 

a type of style that encompasses 
clothing, interior design and hobbies 
— that was born and raised on the 
internet, but is centered around an 
idyllic, isolated country life. For some, 

it’s simply about fashion and visual art.

However, as it has gained traction, 

others have expanded this aesthetic to 
include a guiding set of principles. In 
essence, to be cottagecore is to live as 
though you reside in a quaint cottage 
in the forest or on a farm. The lifestyle 
aspect of the aesthetic encourages 
crafting, sewing, growing plants 
(both for food and enjoyment) and 
living simply.

Cottagecore has been used for 

positivity and activism in a number 
of ways. Many cottagecore fans are 
insistent that the aesthetic’s reliance 
on nature implies that all who embrace 
it should be active environmentalists. 
The trend has also been embraced by 
the LGBTQ+ community due to what 
some say is an imagined escapism 
from heteronormative society. For 
some, cottagecore is a response to the 

exhausting, anxiety-inducing culture 
of constant productivity that comes 
with capitalism; therefore, many fans 
consider themselves anti-capitalists.

Though the trend bills itself as 

idyllic and, to some extent, utopic, it 
isn’t free from criticism. Those who 
disapprove of cottagecore doubt that 
fans of the aesthetic realize the true 
hardships of rural life. Visuals tend to 
be very polished and beautiful, failing 
to acknowledge how messy life in 
nature can truly be. And, whether or 
not it does so purposefully, the trend 
romanticizes a lifestyle that comes 
with unique hardships, unimaginable 
to 
cottagecore 
fans 
born 
and 

raised in urban and suburban 
areas. Cottagecore chooses not to 
acknowledge rural poverty and lack of 
resources, along with the heavy labor 
involved in the upkeep of a farm.

A quick search of cottagecore 

shows mostly similar images: white 
women 
in 
impractical 
dresses 

standing in fields. There is a lack of 
visible people of color, along with a lack 
of discussion around the implications 
of land ownership. The few POC 
creators that embrace the trend are 
buried under the Eurocentric images 
that social media tends to favor 
due to biased censorship. The line 
between reclaiming countryside life 
and a history of racism, sexism and 
colonialism is at times uncomfortably 
thin.

It’s also perplexing that, although 

these aesthetics advocate for sewing 
and thrifting clothing, they can get 
expensive. Cottagecore has a large 
presence on Etsy, where skirts, 
dresses and blouses typically sell for 
anywhere from $30 to over $100. Due 

to the high cost of homemade clothing, 
many people have turned to fast 
fashion, which is known to horribly 
exploit workers (especially those 
who are POC) and the environment. 
Knowingly supporting this seems to 
be in direct opposition to the inviting, 
eco-friendly stances of cottagecore 
fans.

What is most intriguing and 

confusing about these aesthetics is 
that they advocate for a simpler life 
— living off the land in isolation — 
and yet there exists the prerequisite 
of being visible online and up to 
date with trends. Although the term 
cottagecore originated in 2018 on 
Tumblr, today it has an enormous 
presence on platforms like Instagram 
and TikTok.

In order to be aware that one’s 

aesthetic could be described as 

“cottagecore” in the first place, 
they must discover the term either 
online or through friends who’ve 
discovered it online. In fact, this 
reliance on social media is causing 
the trend to be inaccessible to those 
who inspired it. Pew Research 
Center’s “Social Media Fact Sheet” 
states that, as of 2019, only 66% of 
adults in the rural United States 
use social media. The root of this 
problem lies in internet access. 
Currently, only 65% of Americans 
in rural areas have high-speed, 
consistent internet access, and this 
number drops to 60% on Tribal land. 
The digital divide is isolating rural 
people from an aesthetic designed to 
romanticize them.

During 
a 
workshop 
I 

participated in last summer, we 
were each asked to share our 
“immigration story.” I didn’t 
end up sharing with the group 
as I didn’t necessarily feel like 
I had much to say: My parents 
immigrated here from South 
Korea in the late ’90s, and I was 
born and raised in the U.S. End 
of story, at least on my end.

I 
recently 
wondered, 

however, if my parents have ever 
been asked this question. Have 
they — my mom in particular 
— ever had the space to recall 
the past 20-plus years of lived 
experiences in this country? 
Have I ever asked them — or her 
— to share it with me? This past 
week, I set up an “interview” of 
sorts with my mom to genuinely 
ask her about her immigration 
to the U.S. and everything 
that followed. My mom was 
taken aback by my request and 
sheepishly told me she would 
jog her memory, and then she 
told me her “immigration story” 
for the first time in my life.

It was 1999 in South Korea, 

she said, and my dad had 
gone to the U.S. a year prior. 
Originally, the plan was for 
them to live in the U.S. while 
my dad furthered his education 
and then return to Korea a 
few years later. When I asked 
her about how she felt on her 
plane ride to the U.S., I thought 
she would tell me about how 
she had felt scared, nervously 
anticipating the future that 
lay before her as a 29-year-old. 
Instead, she laughed and told 
me that the whole time she had 
only been thinking about how 
to occupy my older brother for 
the duration of the 14-hour 
plane ride, as he was just over 

two years old at the time. She 
said she had just been so excited 
to see her husband on the other 
side.

When she landed in Portland, 

Ore., my dad was excited to take 
her home in a real American 
car. It was an old 1984 Buick 
and, despite his enthusiasm, 
she said it buckled and spewed 
and could barely last more than 
an hour’s drive. She laughed at 
him endearingly while sharing 
this story, telling me that she 
had wondered to herself if this 
was what the rumored U.S. was 
really like. My mom arrived in 
the U.S. with my older brother 
on July 3, 1999, and she believed 
the people around her who 
told her that the fireworks the 
next night must have been to 
welcome her into this new land. 

For the first three years or 

so after their immigration, my 
parents lived in Eugene, Ore., 
where I was born. My dad had 
been attending graduate school 
at the University of Oregon 
at the time, and my family 
lived in the housing complex 
for 
graduate 
students 
and 

their families. Eugene was the 
perfect place to be, she said, a 
gorgeous Pacific Northwestern 
city 
with 
a 
breezy 
small-

town 
feel. 
Surrounded 
by 

trees everywhere and only an 
hour’s drive from the ocean — 
which was good, because the 
Buick couldn’t take any more 
than that — she recalled this 
period of her life in blissful 
memory. I listened to her tell 
me about the huge lawn that 
stretched between the student 
apartments, how she would 
spend her days barefoot on the 
grass and read at the picnic 
tables while letting me crawl 
around.

A thread of my mother’s

YOON KIM
MiC Columnist

Last Friday, Kota the Friend 

released his sixth studio album in 
collaboration with Statik Selektah. 
And much like his previous releases, 
put any track of his on shuffle and 
you’ll be instantly engulfed by the 
effortless flow and phenomenal 
production quality of his music. 
What makes this 28-year-old Black, 
Brooklyn-born rapper stand out the 
most, however, are his lyrics.

Being an independent act, Kota 

clearly takes full creative liberties 
with all of his work, which is 
shown through his words. In his 
music, he often speaks on themes 
of (male) emotional vulnerability 
and connection to our inner spirit. 
These themes came up in his latest 
album, To Kill A Sunrise as well as 
in his prior discography. 

Despite 
his 
lyrics 
being 

often vulnerable in nature, they 
still 
resonate 
with 
positivity. 

Vulnerability begets strength. And 
Kota is strong in showing the softer 
sides of himself. In his track, “The 
Cold,” he states, “Water in my soul, 
the pressure on my back / Pushing 
through my lows.” And in the 
following track, “The Love,” he says, 
“I’m giving it to you broken / And 
still, you cherished and want it / You 
love me openly homie / And that’s 
exactly what love is.”

In “Live & Direct,” he starts the 

second verse with, “Me and my 
brothers speak about our trauma ... 
How long can a man carry a world 
before he cry for help?”

Later on in the aforementioned 

“The Love” Kota states, “Love is 
patient, perseverance, consideration. 

Deeper than appearances, quick to 
air out imitation / Bring out your 
power and pushing you past your 
limitations, taking you to your 
destiny and your liberation.” 

Kota successfully draws the 

connection between the emotionally 
vulnerable nature of love, and that 
vulnerability is what ultimately 
brings us in touch with our higher 
purpose. With every track he elicits 
the ongoing battle towards self-
attunement. Ultimately, Kota never 
fails to remind us that the “point of 
our existence isn’t physical.” 

Going back to his track, “The 

Cold,” he says, “I’m living my life in 
tandem with all the shit I believe / 
Movin’ in unison with my spirit, 
toward the dream,” and “I’m 
focusin’ past the physical, hear it 
and take it literal.”

In “What ya Sayin,’” he proclaims, 

“I’m genuine in spirit even when I’m 
dead wrong.” And in his last track of 
the album, “Sunset,” he raps, “I kept 
my spirit high when my frequency 
was low.” 

These references to the spirit 

serve as a reminder of our broader 
purpose 
beyond 
the 
material 

world. Kota often conveys his 
contradictory tendencies to value 
money and material possessions 
and how those distractions keep 
him from being who he truly is. 
We see this in the way he discusses 
his ego, which he also makes many 
references to throughout. 

In “Go Now,” he says, “Pull off on 

my heart and leave my ego on the 
curb,” and in “Day Glow,” he states, 
“I put my ego on the shelf, so she can 
love me for free.” Here, we see this 
inner spiritual battle between being 
proud of oneself versus remaining 
modest. 

In his previous album, Lyrics 

to Go, Vol. 2, in the song “Santa 
Barbara” we hear him remark, “Say 
that I want happiness but it seem 
like I’m scared of that, so I’m never 
idle or I might get suicidal” followed 
later by, “I just sit and wonder what 
is holding me back and why it feel 
impossible just for my soul to relax 
/ And I’m feeling so conflicted 
‘bout this shit that I’ve been given, 
I’m livin’ to get up out of this cycle 
that’s turning’ vicious, for real.” In 
this song, he illuminates the allure 
of grind-and-hustle culture that 
pushes us away from being the 
divine beings that we are.

While Kota recognizes that 

it’s important for us (especially 
Black males) to have a sense of self-
affirmation, he also recognizes 
the importance in staying humble. 
When I hear his music, I feel like 
he’s speaking directly to me as a 
Black man, allowing me the courage 
to affirm my own existence as an 
African-American in an extremely 
anti-Black world. 

His track “For Colored Boys’’ 

from his album FOTO epitomizes 
this the most. In this song Kota 
speaking to his newborn son 
claims, “We are creators; we don’t 
go beggin’ for placement where 
we are not wanted,’’ later followed 
by, “Why conform to a society that 
hates you, and spent all they energy 
tryna break you?” 

Much like his previous work, 

To Kill a Sunrise carries with 
it this same radical confidence 
and confirmation necessary to 
brilliantly and boldly be who you 
want to be.

YOUR WEEKLY

ARIES

If there is something you would 
rather not have become public 
knowledge, Aries, you will need to 
be careful what you say this week. 
Your own urge to brag, boast or 

simply gain attention 
could sabotage your 
need to keep some 
things private.

AQUARIUS

GEMINI

You may be expected to toe the 
line or conform in some way this 
week, especially in your working 
professional life. When Mercury 
squares Mars, you face having to 

choose between what is 
expected of you versus 
what you’d really like 
to say. Choose wisely.

SAGITTARIUS

CAPRICORN

SCORPIO

CANCER

Too many questions leave you 
wondering what you can rely 
upon this week. If you are 
religious, expect to feel unsure 
about your own beliefs – you may 

even experience 
something which 
directly contradicts 
them, leaving you 
deeply unsettled.

TAURUS

Try not to get friends involved in 
your financial situation, if you can 
help it. It’s your own private 
business, but if you borrow money, 
or ask for help, you may find 

things not quite so 
private anymore.

LIBRA
LEO

If you have hidden resentments 
towards friends, colleagues or 
acquaintances, your true feelings 
may not say hidden for very much 
longer.

Read your weekly horoscopes from astrology.tv

Expect a certain amount of 
conflict this week between the 
pressures of work and the 
pressures of your relationship. 

Are you feeling stuck in a rut, 
Libra? When Mercury squares up to 
Mars this week, you may feel tired 
of doing the responsible thing, or 
the expected thing, and you will 

yearn to walk on the wild 

side.

Risk-taking, especially emotional 
risks, is high on your agenda this 
week, for some reason. It’s almost 
as though you’re tempting fate, 
willing something to go wrong. 

Emotionally, this is very 

difficult territory, 

especially when 
Mercury squares up to 
Mars.

There is discomfort this week 
between your blood family and 
your partner or your in-laws. This 
is not at all pleasant and you may 
feel very much stuck in the 

middle, especially when 

Mercury squares up to 

Mars and communi-
cations turn sour.

It’s easy to make mistakes this 
week, Capricorn, especially if you 
are very busy and/or life is very 
chaotic.

It’s difficult to focus this week, 
especially if you’re not enjoying 
your job, your studies or your other 
responsibilities. The urge to run 
away is strong, especially when 

Mercury squares up to 

Mars.

Something from the past seems to 
be holding you back at the 
moment, especially when Mercury 
squares up to Mars. It may be a 
lack of confidence, especially if 
your family was not that 

supportive to you as 
you grew up.

“Nerds are not bad things!”

“Should we make it up for the

That is my key to happiness.”

On the highway, I could easily 

“put the pedal to the metal” 
and cruise at 80 miles per hour 
towards my destination. Watching 
trees pass by. Windows down. 
Music blasting.

The problem is when I don’t 

know where that destination is. 
I’m going fast, but I don’t even 
know where I’m going. 

Looking back, it feels like life 

went by fast even though I’m 
still only 18. I remember when I 
got stitches on my lip and chin 
like it was just last week even 
though it was 11 years ago. I can 
still vividly picture the moment 
I got disqualified at a swim meet 
because I didn’t flip-turn correctly 
and lost the first place title even 
though it happened when I was 12.

The 
same 
is 
true 
when 

thinking about what I wanted to 
be. Growing up, my dream job 
changed at the same speed that I 
hit snooze when I hear my alarm 
blare: fast. I would want to be a 
teacher one week, a chef the next. 
The possibilities were endless, 
but at the same time, these 
possibilities weren’t promised. 
This wasn’t Aladdin. There’s no 
Genie that grants my wishes for 
what the future holds. None of it is 
for certain.

Not only does it feel like life is 

moving fast, it feels like everything 
is getting faster and faster. We can 

look something up on Google and 
get answers within seconds. We 
order food and it comes to us in a 
short amount of time. 

But time itself is still staying the 

same. There’s still 60 seconds to a 
minute, 24 hours to a day.

The result: we, as a collective 

society, are losing our ability to 
slow down. 

And I don’t mean this in terms 

of driving speeds. I mean this in 
the sense that many people chase 
the adrenaline rush –– that blood 
pumping feeling where, even 
if just for a second, you can do 
anything in the world. In school 
we’re always go, go, go. At work 
we’re always go, go, go. It’s hard 
to take things at a slower pace as 
the world becomes more work-
centric, so we feel that we have 
to constantly be doing something 
productive in order to be doing 
something worthwhile. 

But as a result, we miss out on 

moments that happen in those 
same milliseconds that we’re 
speed-walking to class or stressed 
out about an upcoming deadline. 

In the example of driving a car, 

some people choose to go 20 or 
30 miles per hour past the speed 
limit when there’s no other cars 
around. But if you slow down, go 
at the speed limit, you’ll see all 
the things you were missing along 
the way. You’ll see the children 
playing together outside. You’ll 
notice how the cloud twists and 
turns into different shapes. You’ll 
absorb the energy of the warm 

sun as it starts to set while the sky 
turns into hues of orange and pink. 

So if you asked me now what I 

want to be, I’ll tell you I want to 
be a psychologist. But in my mind, 
the sole thing that I really want 
is to be content with myself and 
the environment that I am in. It 
may sound cliché, but I feel it’s a 
thought that can resonate with 
a lot of people, but it’s also not 
something that I feel we take the 
time to think about. 

The future is so unpromised 

I find it hard motivating myself 
to continue pursuing a major. 
It’s hard to decide what I want 
to dedicate the rest of my life to 
when I’m not even 20. If I could, 
I would pack up my bags and live 
in NYC or Seoul for a bit with no 
exact plan in mind until I feel like 
it’s time for the next destination. 
If I could, I would live in the now 
and not with my head calculating 
the steps of my future.

Lately, I actively remind myself 

to slow down. To take a break from 
school when I can and dedicate 
that time to activities that help 
me enjoy life, even in a pandemic. 
Whether that be going on a walk 
with my family or looking out 
the window when my parents are 
driving instead of being consumed 
by my phone, I think soaking in my 
surroundings is just as fulfilling as 
that adrenaline rush. 

For now, I’ll be going cruising 

through life at 20 mph towards an 
unpromised future. And I’m okay 
with that.

I Do

Disclaimer: Though there is 

still a long way to go, movements 
that push for marriage equality 
have swept through Asia in the 
last decade. It is important that we 
take an active role in condemning 
homophobia and discrimination 
on the basis of gender identity. 
Note that I use the general terms 
“bride” and “groom” throughout 
in reference to my own experiences 
with my uncle’s wedding. 

Since turning 20, the questions 

from my parents and extended 
family have shifted from “Where 
do you want to go to university?” 
or “How are your grades?” to “Do 
you have a boyfriend? Are you 
seeing anybody? When are you 
having kids?” and so on. While 
I don’t know how to respond to 
their questions, I’ll admit that I 
often think about getting married.

My parents are from Malaysia 

and Singapore. This means I not 
only imagine wearing a white lace 
ball gown, but I also see myself 
walking down a banquet hall 
adorned with glowing red paper 
lanterns and walls that shine with 
golden Chinese characters which 
promise good fortune.

Back in 2013 when my uncle got 

married, I was fortunate enough to 
get to witness some of our unique 
wedding traditions in action that I 
hope to repeat when it’s finally my 
turn. From the seemingly wacky 
to the traditional, each ritual 
emphasizes the importance of 
family and promises a prosperous 
future.

Starting with the date of the 

wedding, it is a fairly common 
practice for couples to seek the 
advice of a fortune teller monk 

or feng shui master to choose 
an auspicious date based on the 
couple’s zodiac signs and birthday 
details. The lunar month of March 
is considered an unlucky time to 
get married because it is the month 
of the Qingming festival, also 
known as “Tomb Sweeping Day,” 
that honors deceased relatives. 
Generally, from my experience, 
any talk about death — even as a 
lighthearted joke and especially 
on special occasions — is highly 
taboo and likely warrants you 
stern or horrified looks and might 
even put you at risk for being the 
subject of the next neighborhood 
aunties’ tea group.

Likewise, couples might avoid 

the lunar month of July because 
of the Hungry Ghost Festival, in 
which it is believed that the gates 
of the afterlife are opened up 
for spirits to roam. Lucky dates 
include the numbers eight and 
nine because their pronunciations 
in Chinese are similar to the words 
“prosper” 
and 
“long-lasting,” 

respectively. For example, my 
parents got married on the 19th in 
the year 1999. 

A couple days before my uncle’s 

wedding, the An Chuang, loosely 
translated to “bed-setting,” took 
place. During this ritual, the 
groom’s parents and grandparents 
will make the matrimonial bed 
with new sheets and blankets in a 
lucky color — typically red or pink 
to represent the start of a new life. 
This job might also be undertaken 
by a “lady of good fortune,” 
someone who is happily married 
and has many healthy children 
and grandchildren, as she is said 
to pass on the good fortune. The 
bed will then also be decorated 
with dried fruits to represent a 
“sweet” marriage as well as other 
grains and nuts. Children might 
also be invited to roll and jump on 

the bed to bless the couple with 
fertility. My brother and I were 
assigned this job in 2013. The 
best part? My aunt and uncle gave 
everyone who participated in the 
ritual lucky red envelopes filled 
with money, which are known as 
“hong bao” in Chinese. 

Based on the birthdate of the 

bride and groom, going down 
to the exact minute, the fortune 
teller monk came up with a unique 
and detailed analysis of what 
zodiac animals were considered 
auspicious for my aunt and 
uncle. Fortunately for me and my 
brother, we were just the zodiac 
animals they needed. We got 
special tasks during the wedding 
such as opening doors for the 
couple and holding the bride’s 
dress, which earned us extra red 
packets. Unfortunately for my 
cousins, who were both zodiac 
animals considered inauspicious 
for the couple, they weren’t 
allowed to participate in some of 
the smaller activities like jumping 
in the bed.

Before the couple returns at 

the end of their wedding day, a 
chicken and rooster might also 
be kept under the bed. When 
released, if the rooster emerges 
first, it is said that the couple’s 
first child will be a boy. If it is the 
chicken that runs out first, the 
first child will be a girl. 

The night before the wedding, 

the hair combing ceremony took 
place. The bride’s mother or an 
invited “lady of good fortune” 
will comb the bride’s hair three 
times while saying three Chinese 
phrases. The first is something 
along the lines of “May you stay 
together all your life.” The second 
is “May your hair and eyebrows 
turn white together,” meaning 
that the couple will grow old 
together. Finally, the third is “May 

your home be filled with lots of 
children and grandchildren.” 

This 
touching 
ceremony 

symbolizes that the bride is 
entering a new stage of adulthood, 
and she might wear white to 
represent purity. It’s at this 
point in my future wedding 
that I imagine I’ll be tearing up 
while my mom is full-on crying. 
Everyone will indulge in tang 
yuan –– a simple dessert that 
consists of chewy and colorful 
glutinous rice flour balls served in 
a sweet soup infused with pandan 
leaves. My description doesn’t 
give this dessert justice, but trust 
me — it’s delicious. My favorite 
is when they’re filled with red 
bean paste or ground peanuts. 
Also eaten during other festive 
occasions such as the Lunar New 
Year, the round shape of the balls 
represents the full moon which, 
in turn, symbolizes wholeness or 
completeness. 

In my opinion, the wildest 

tradition is the wedding gate 
crash. On the wedding day, 
my uncle went to his bride’s 
house and, with the help of his 
groomsmen, had to prove his love 
and commitment to his bride and 
her family. Only after completing 
a list of oftentimes embarrassing 
and disgusting tasks — such as 
waxing the hair of your legs, 
learning ridiculous dances, eating 
bizarre food combinations and 
trying to pick the right key out of 
a pile from a bucket of freezing 
water — was he able to see her. 
Anybody is also allowed to 
demand bribes from the groom to 
let him pass the front door, which 
I unfortunately didn’t discover 
until after the game was nearly 
over. 

Stop leaving Her out of the conversation

Happy Women’s History Month! 

I’m sure you’ve seen cute graphics 
of women floating around your 
Instagram explore page. Or maybe 
your Twitter timeline is flooded 
with celebrities acknowledging the 
important women in their lives. 
This month intends to celebrate 
the accomplishments and strides 
towards equality women have made 
throughout the world, as well as 
celebrate the impact women have 
in all aspects of life. While it’s quite 
admirable to look at the much-
needed improvements we have 
made in relation to gender equality, 
it has become increasingly apparent 
that this month fails to shine light 
on the women who are continuously 
left out of the conversation: Black 
transgender women.

The intersectionality of being 

Black, transgender and a woman 
disproportionately 
make 
these 

women targets of hate crimes and 
state-sanctioned violence. During 
the summer of 2020, six Black 
transgender 
women 
–– 
Brayla 

Stone, Merci Mack, Shakiie Peters, 
Draya McCarty, Tatiana Hall and 
Bree Black –– were killed within 
nine days. The National Council 
for 
Transgender 
Equality 
U.S. 

Transgender 
Survey 
revealed 

that 47% of the survey’s Black 
respondents “reported being denied 
equal treatment, verbally harassed, 
and/or physically attacked in the past 
year because of being transgender.” 
While 22% of transgender people 
reported 
experiencing 
biased 

harassment from police officers, 
38% of Black trans people reported 
this kind of harassment. Given 
that transgender women of color 
are 
disproportionately 
victims 

of hate crimes, it can be assumed 
that 
Black 
trans 
women 
are 

experiencing violence all the more 
frequently due to the intersection of 
transphobia and ongoing anti-Black 
oppression. Kimberlé Crenshaw, 
Black feminist who coined the 
term “intersectionality,” says the 
term aims to acknowledge and 
account for the fact that “many 
of our social justice problems like 
racism and sexism are overlapping, 
creating multiple levels of injustice.” 
Intersectionality 
fundamentally 

helps to acknowledge the role 
oppression plays in the formation 
of discriminatory policies and its 
subsequent effect on Black trans 
women’s identities.

The violence that Black trans 

women experience not only exists 
interpersonally, but also systemically, 
as 
Black 
transgender 
people 

disproportionately 
experience 

high rates of unemployment and 
poverty. The unemployment rate 
for Black trans people in the United 
States is 26%, which is four times 
greater than that of the general 
population. Black trans people also 
experience homelessness at a rate 

five times greater than the national 
average. While these statistics are 
generalized to Black trans people 
as a whole, it is an inescapable fact 
that low-income Black trans women 
are victimized by violence at even 
higher rates, both interpersonally 
and 
through 
state-sanctioned 

means. More specifically, women as 
a whole earning between $15,000 
and $24,000 reported a third more 
occurrences of domestic violence 
than women who earn more than 
$75,000. 
Because 
Black 
trans 

women face difficulties regarding 
employment and poverty, they 
are likely to fit within this income 
bracket that correlates to higher 
rates of domestic violence. 80% 
of trans women also reported 
experiencing discrimination while 
working, which creates an unsafe 
and unstable environment. For 
many Black trans women, economic 
insecurity corresponds with higher 
rates of intimate partner violence –– 
these women are less likely to report 
cases of violence due to their distrust 
in the criminal justice system, as 
the existing legal system inherently 
upholds ideals of white supremacy. 
For one example amongst many, 
Black people are incarcerated at five 
times the rate of white people while 
also making up 47% of wrongful 
convictions. 
The 
legal 
system 

uplifts the white majority through 
policy and law while systematically 
ensuring that marginalized groups, 
including 
Black 
trans 
women, 

continue to experience violence and 
poverty.

In 
order 
to 
economically 

empower Black trans women, new 

policies must be put in place across 
the board. Universal basic income 
has the potential to keep Black trans 
women above the poverty line, 
which would allow them to leave 
the “economic threshold” that is 
associated with the highest rates 
of violence. Affirmative action in 
relation to employment for Black 
trans women could also improve 
their job outlook, consequently 
minimizing unemployment rates and 
promoting safer work environments. 
Allowing Black trans women to 
have representation in creating 
policies that will benefit their 
community, such as those outlined 
by Trans Agenda of Liberation, is 
another effective starting point for 
promoting upward mobility.

Despite the fact that violence 

against Black transgender women 
is unfortunately common, there 
is hardly any policy in action 
preventing their loss of life. Violence 
towards trans people increased 
drastically 
during 
the 
Trump 

presidency. 
His 
administration 

also enacted isolating policies, such 
as eliminating protections from 
health 
care 
discrimination 
for 

transgender patients and rescinding 
gender-identity based protections 
for 
transgender 
students 
–– 

including Title IX policy reversals, 
which 
no 
longer 
safeguarded 

rights 
of 
transgender 
students 

in public schools to use facilities 
in accordance with their gender 
identity. Additionally, the Trump 
administration appointed several 
anti-LGBTQ+ political judges and 
policy 
makers. 
Discriminatory 

practices are also maintained at the 

state level –– South Carolina 
recently removed gender and sexual 
orientation from their hate crime 
bill, leaving Black trans women 
and other members of the LGBTQ+ 
community unprotected in South 
Carolina. The large negative reaction 
to this, however, caused lawmakers 
to add it back in five days after it was 
removed. Though sexual orientation 
protection was added back to the 
hate crime bill, the initial decision 
to exclude the LGBTQ+ community 
shows that this community isn’t on 
the forefront of policymakers’ minds 
when deciding who to advocate for. 
And in Michigan, a bill has been 
introduced in the state legislature 
limiting public high school students 
to compete on sports teams based 

only on their “biological sex.” 
This bill very obviously targets 
transgender students, particularly 
transgender women, denying the 
legitimacy of their identity, and in 
doing so, uses sports as a means to 
misgender young trans women. This 
bill perpetuates transphobic falsities 
that cisgender women are “losing 
opportunities” 
to 
transgender 

women 
and 
subsequently, 
that 

trans women are not women. 
Federal and state governments 
perpetuating violence against an 
already marginalized community 
leave Black trans women without the 
protection they need.

A treatise on failure

Today I am wishing that more 

people were honest about failure, 
because I sprinkle my own into 
conversation like candy. I failed a 
quiz last week, and I slipped on ice 
taking out the trash. I dropped a class 
my first semester of college. I quit 
gymnastics and figure skating and 
violin and painting classes because 
I could never master any of their 
outcomes just right. The New Yorker 
has rejected my work more times 
than both fingers can count, and 
I still submit my stories anyways. 
I have never been the bearer of 
perfect grades. Not once. Not even 
in middle school. There are half-
finished puzzles in my basement and 
plans of a treehouse that I’d convince 
my father to build me one day, in 
notebooks I’ve barely ever used. I 
didn’t call my grandmother back 
before she died. 

However, I feel as if my beloved 

college newspaper is the only place 
in the world where failure is no 
longer relegated to an extension 
of the self, a personal shortcoming 
and a deficiency of the soul. Failure 
here is too-squeaky doors, and 
bikes that rust in the rain, and milk 
accidentally left out to curdle –– utter 
mistakes, and much more deeply, a 
thing that is an unequivocally and 
wholly accepted facet of the human 
condition. I have failed many times 
here, submitted work I’d feverishly 
written an hour before noon, and 
more so, work that is not my best. I 
have haphazardly placed commas 
where I’ve felt they belong rather 
than where they actually belong and 
left my editor Maya hanging for five 
days on occasion because her texts 
had slipped my radar. In meetings, I 
am guilty of silence even though I’m 
brimming with thoughts, words and 

ideas, like “ANAMIKA I LOVED 
YOUR PIECE ON PAATI AND 
SPONTANEITY” and “MAYA AND 
ANAMIKA 
AND 
GABRIJELA 

AND CLAIRE HAO YOUR EDITS 
AFFORDED ME THE DIGNITY 
OF BEING HEARD,” and yet in 
this space, I am still a writer. I am 
a writer who receives suggestions 
and good-jobs and wow-I-didn’t-
know-you-could-do-thats 
and 

when I speak here, the room listens, 
and I allow myself to take up space 
for the first time because I am a 
columnist for The Michigan Daily. 
I send my work to my mother and 
to my two friends Siri and Duaa, 
who tell me my words make them 
feel something, and sometimes my 
father comes home with a flesh-
and-bone copy of this paper in print 
and flays it open on the dining room 
table to read by himself. 

In high school, a boy from my AP 

U.S. History class in room C-326 
said that I was far too stupid to be 
there, and my friends laughed for 
months on end behind my back. 
I was girl-that-didn’t-know-the-
answer-when-called-on and girl-
who-was-least-likely-to-succeed. 
And I knew nothing about Manifest 
Destiny, too little about trickle-
down economics, and the AIDS 
crisis, and Edward Hopper and 
American 
solitude. 
There 
was 

nothing that was mine and only 
mine. No robotics or track-and-
field or dance or Science Olympiad 
or theater. Nothing that granted 
me respect or acknowledgment or 
validity or belonging, and I simply 
existed and mostly I was girl-who-
was-a-failure. 

This publication and the people 

within it have never demanded 
perfection from me, never asked for 
anything more than myself, and I 
have been in search of such a feeling, 
this special sort of requiem for a 
dream, my entire life.

‘Say Her Name... Too’: Bridging dance and social activism

This Sunday, the University of 

Michigan’s 
student 
organization 

Creatives of Color hosted a powerful 
discussion and movement workshop, 
which was moderated over Zoom 
by Dr. Antonio C. Cuyler, associate 
professor of arts administration and 
director of the MA Program at Florida 
State University, and Lawrence M. 
Jackson, associate chair and associate 
professor of dance at the University 
of Alabama. The conversation was 
centered on how dance can serve as a 
vehicle for social activism. 

CoC was created by student and 

filmmaker Drew Metcalf in 2017 
through OptiMize’s Social Innovation 
Challenge. The intention was to unite 
and foster a community of artists of 
color across campus. The event began 
with a speaker introduction by LSA 

senior and current CoC President 
Tiffany Harris, who introduced the 
viewing of the dance film “Say Her 
Name… Too.” Choreographed and 
directed by Jackson, this short screen 
dance combined cinematic elements 
with choreography to explore the lives 
of five Black women who died at the 
hands of law enforcement: Natasha 
McKenna, Sandra Bland, Michelle 
Cusseaux, Atatiana Jefferson and 
Breonna Taylor.

In the compelling six-minute 

performance, 
each 
of 
the 
five 

University 
of 
Alabama 
dancers 

embodied their respective “character” 
portrayals 
through 
intentional 

movement and the use of symbolic 
props. The organic emotion of the 
dancers and their interpretations 
inspired an engaging discussion 
surrounded in love and empathy for 
the rest of the event. 

As Jackson explained, “(dance is) 

an embodiment of all the arts.” 

Each solo section was introduced 

by reiterations of each of the killed 
woman’s last words, a creative 
decision made by Jackson, as he later 
explained, to attribute the lives of 
Natasha, Sandra, Michelle, Atatiana 
and Breonna to their respective 
dancer’s flow. 

Jackson and the dancers sought 

to give life to these women and their 
voices, explaining that they were “not 
ever trying to speak for them, but 
having them speak for themselves.”

**
Following the viewing, Jackson 

and his dancers demonstrated the 
creative process that went into their 
performance by leading the attendees 
through an immersive movement 
workshop. For Jackson, it was 
important to find a common thread 
among the women portrayed in this 
piece and all people of color brutalized 
by law enforcement at large. Upon 
choreographing the piece, he found 
this connection through a three-step 
movement phrase. 

Movement phrases, he said, act 

similarly to literary phrases with a 
beginning, middle and end. Dancers 
use these movement phrases to 
convey the meaning of certain words 
and 
experiences 
through 
their 

art, using them as a starting point 
in formulating their movements. 
When he considered the encounters 
that these women had with law 
enforcement, he came up with three 
foundational words to visualize the 
emotions they had likely experienced: 
“what?”, “me” and “arrested.”

During 
the 
demonstration, 

Jackson guided the viewers through 
his choreographing process word-
by-word, 
connoting 
a 
physical 

movement with each phrase. For 
“what?”, he instructed the audience 
to put their hands up: the typical, 
intuitive response following being 
confronted by the police. The next 
movement represented the word 
“me” and was communicated by 
pointing his index finger to his chest, 

encouraging the audience to do the 
same. Finally, he portrayed the phrase 
“arrested” by curling his hands into 
fists and crossing his arms across his 
chest to represent the action of being 
handcuffed as audience members 
mimicked his movement. 

While the three-part phrase is 

constructed of rather mundane 
movements 
he 
described 
as 

“pedestrian,” 
Jackson 
explained 

how these simple steps could be 
transformed into more complex 
dance moves as well as manipulated 
and stylized to convey different 
emotions by altering the pace, energy 
and space used to perform those 
gestures. 

According to Jackson, movement 

explorations served as a crucial 
component that Jackson and his 
dancers utilized to cultivate a 
largely 
virtual 
creative 
process. 

Through Zoom, they were able 
to use movement phrases while 
collaboratively experimenting with 

in-time 
movements, 
angles 
and 

facial expressions through remote 
rehearsals. 

**
During the discussion, Jackson 

emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 

dancers doing their “due diligence” 
as visual artists, which involved 
thorough research on the lives of the 
women they were portraying in order 
to create an authentic representation 
of their experiences. However, he 
also noted that though it’s easy to get 
caught up in all the research, they 
must never lose sight of humanizing 
these women and connecting beyond 
whatever 
information 
is 
found 

through news articles or other sources 
— not only capturing who they were 
as people but also expressing how 
they may have felt by recounting their 
own lived or understood experiences 
with injustice.

A

round 9 p.m. on March 3, 
33-year-old Sarah Everard 
left her friend’s house in 

London to walk home. She wore 
bright clothes, walked on well-lit 
streets and called her boyfriend 
along the way. In other words, she did 
everything right. 

Yet, on March 12, it was confirmed 

that her remains had been found in a 
wooded area of Kent, England, over 
fifty miles away from her home. Sarah 
had been abducted and murdered by a 
police officer. A man whose profession 
is fundamentally based on keeping the 
public safe had used his position to 
attack a vulnerable woman. 

Following the horrific murder 

of 
Sarah 
Everard, 
numerous 

hashtags began trending, including 
#TextMeWhenYouGetHome. These 
hashtags depict the demoralizing and 
frustrating reality women must face 
when alone. Like me, many women 
in college can understand what Sarah 
Everard was thinking while walking 
home. The anxiety when someone is 
walking a little too quickly from behind 
or when a car begins to slow beside 
you. We are taught to leave before 
dark, never wear both headphones, 
share our live location, know who is 
behind us, have keys in hand, an alarm 
within reach — the list continues. 
However, these are all reactionary and 
do not guarantee safety in a disgusting 
game of luck. It is the reason fathers 
fear for their daughters. They know 
what other men can do when given 
the opportunity. 

On March 16, a gunman traveled 

to several spas in Atlanta and 
murdered eight women, six of 
whom were of Asian descent. When 
questioned, the gunman claimed 
the attack was to combat his sex 
addiction by ridding himself of 
temptation, further encouraging 
the ignorant belief that racism and 
sexism are fundamentally separate 
issues. During a press conference, 
Captain 
Jay 
Baker, 
Cherokee 

County Sheriff’s Office spokesman, 
said the gunman was having a “bad 
day.” How insensitive does one 
have to be to try to invoke pity for 
a misogynistic murderer? Eight 
women had suddenly lost their 
lives, and Baker thought it would be 
appropriate to defend the man that 

had caused this immense tragedy 
and pain.

Excuses are consistently made 

for perpetrators, while victims are 
questioned for their behavior and 
clothing. It is a phenomenon that 
has seen little evolution over the last 
century. Men, inspired by the actions 
of other men, feel empowered to 
order women around. In the 1970s, 
“The Ripper” was causing chaos 
across Britain that led to women 
being instructed to always have a 
male companion or risk being blamed 
for their own death. The ideology that 
women should be the ones to alter 
their behavior ignores the fact that 
women are in no manner responsible 
for the actions of sexual predators 
and, therefore, should not be forced 
to change their conduct. 

In early March, the release of a 

report by the All Party Parliamentary 
Group for UN Women revealed that 
86% of British women between the 
ages of 18 and 24 have experienced 
sexual harassment in public spaces. 
Due to the timing of its release, 
the report has been discussed in 
conjunction with Sarah Everard’s 
death to demonstrate how frequent 
sexual harassment and assault are in 
daily life for women. However, the 
subsequent “#97percent” that began 
trending on Twitter and TikTok has 
faced retaliation with the assertion 
that “not all men” are predators.

The “not all men” movement is 

an inherently selfish act intended 
to redirect the conversation and 
dismiss the experiences of women. 
When a woman has the courage to 
talk about what happened to her, you 
listen and support her. 

There are a range of behaviors that 

can be classified as sexual harassment 
and all of them can have an emotional 
toll. “If you immediately respond 
with ‘not all men’ rather than digest 
the facts and information or actively 
think about how to be part of the 
solution, then you are in fact part of 
the problem…” is how Twitter user 
@casiahcagan responded to the 
revitalized “not all men” movement. 
Casiah Cagan’s post reflects the 
mentality of many women across the 
internet toward #NotAllMen because 
it is simply unhelpful to talk about how 
you’re a nice guy in this situation. 

For a woman walking on the 

street, there is no time to distinguish 
between the good men and the bad 
because there is no way to know, so 
being wary of all men is yet another 
security measure women use to 
protect themselves. Obviously, women 
know not all men are predators, but it 
is impossible to know which men are 
for sure problematic or not until it is 
too late. Dismissing the commonplace 
experiences of women because of what 
you perceive your own character to be 
shifts the focus toward you instead of 
continuing a necessary conversation. 

To any male reader that adopts 

this approach: in Women’s History 
Month alone there have been 
numerous 
targeted 
attacks 
on 

women, and you have the arrogance 
to tell me not to worry because you’re 
a “good” guy? This isn’t about you. I 
don’t care how nice you are because 
if you are not actively combating 
violence against women, you are 
perpetuating its normalcy. 

Instead, listen to what women have 

to say. Don’t become defensive or shift 
the discussion away from its main 
topic, make excuses for the behavior 
of other men or claim a woman is 
overreacting. Not being a perpetrator 
or a victim does not justify writing 
the issue off as something that has 
no impact on your life. Far too often, 
unacceptable behavior is brushed 
aside and allowed to spread rampantly 
across society. We all need to learn to 
have empathy so that more women 
can come forward without fear of 
cross-examination or victim-blaming. 

While some women may have 

not experienced sexual harassment 
firsthand, the fear of it is instilled 
at an early age. Sexual assault and 
harassment can happen to anyone at 
any time and the best a woman can do 
is follow the same unwritten rulebook 
as Sarah Everard. In order for sexual 
assault and harassment to be addressed, 
there has to be an understanding that 
there are many opportunities men 
take for granted, because they are 
typically not the victims of gender-
based violence. It may not be all men, 
but sexual harassment and assault 
certainly impacts every woman. 

I do not care how “nice” you are.

** Editor’s Note: This op-ed was 
published three hours before the 
University announced their plan to 
fully disinvest from holdings related to 
fossil fuels by 2050. 
T

he final report from the 
President’s 
Commission 

on 
Carbon 
Neutrality, 

released March 18, states that the 
University of Michigan’s plans to 
become entirely carbon neutral 
across all three campuses by 2025 
for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, 
which would include all power 
purchased by the University and 
produced on sites like the Central 
Campus Power Plant. Slightly over 
a year ago, the University froze all 
future investments in the fossil fuel 
industry in order to reconsider its 
own contribution to climate change. 
Despite these commitments, the 
University’s reliance on fossil fuels 
trounces through investments and 
how energy is consumed on campus. 

As our organizations waited for 

the final recommendations by the 
PCCN, we saw how other student 
and faculty groups have responded in 
strength. Climate Action Movement 
at the University calls for a five-
year divestment from the fossil fuel 
industry. Voices for Carbon Neutrality 
urges revising of investment policies 
to align more closely with carbon 
neutrality goals. The Michigan Ross 
Energy Club supports implementing 
carbon pricing before 2025 and 
environmental, social and corporate 
governance metrics for endowment 
investment decisions. 

As members of two sustainability-

oriented 
clubs, 
we 
resonate 

with these requests. The ESG 
Sustainability Committee adopts 
and creates awareness of sustainable 
practices across the College of 
Engineering, and Citizens’ Climate 
Lobby at the University of Michigan 
seeks to create the political will for 
a national carbon fee and dividend. 
Coupling two of the many emerging 
strategies — divestment and internal 
carbon pricing — is an especially 
promising way to guide the transition 
and propel the University to the 
forefront of national leadership and 
commitment to carbon neutrality. 

Despite the rapidly-increasing 

market 
for 
renewables, 
many 

institutions like ours are still stuck 
in the past. In 2019, the University’s 
investments in “natural resources” 
totaled roughly $1.3 billion, or about 

9% of their total investments. Most of 
this investment is in fossil fuels, such 
as oil and gas.

We are all aware of the 

detrimental effects the burning of 
fossil fuels poses on the environment, 
public health, agriculture, national 
security and more. Although we 
hope the Board of Regents listens to 
the ethical arguments, divestment 
is often weighed more by today’s 
economic factors. 

We couldn’t agree more with 

Regent Ron Weiser (R) when he 
acknowledged that “the long-term 
risk of investing in fossil fuels is 
substantial.” The University’s split 
from the industry would remove itself 
from the growing negative stigma 
surrounding fossil fuels, sending a 
signal to other universities that the 
industry is becoming a thing of the past. 
Widespread public stigmatization 
might change the behavior of our 
markets and governments. Fund 
managers and investors could start 
“negative 
screening” 
fossil 
fuel 

companies, and banks may even 
stop lending to fossil fuel companies. 
Moreover, the government may be 
pressured to place legislation on fossil 
fuel companies such as a carbon tax or 
outright ban. This, in itself, would have 
a more significant effect on fossil fuel 
companies than any other method.

If creating a stigma around 

the use of fossil fuels isn’t a good 
enough incentive, then consider the 
continuously decreasing price of 
solar and wind power. Renewables 
accounted for the newest United 
States electricity-generating capacity 
so far this year, and they’re only 
expected to grow. The University of 
California fully divested from fossil 
fuels in 2020 and is reinvesting in 
renewable energy over a five-year 
time span. It is absolutely possible for 
the University to divest from fossil 
fuels as well as continue this positive 
change in market norms. 

Even if the University cannot 

fully divest within five years, there 
are many policy tools at our disposal 
to accelerate the transition. What 
especially caught our eye in the 
PCCN report was the mention of 
an internal carbon pricing system. 
This bipartisan, globally-supported 
policy has proven to be effective and 
scalable at many other universities, 
including 
Yale, 
Arizona 
State, 

Princeton and the University of 
California, Los Angeles. An internal 

carbon pricing system at the 
University, functioning in tandem 
with a Revolving Energy Fund 
(synonymous to a Revolving Loan 
Fund), could reduce utility expenses, 
raise revenue for sustainability 
projects and build the momentum 
for state and national carbon pricing. 

Investing in the fossil fuel industry 

no longer corresponds to long-
term growth. Oil and gas stocks 
have underperformed and are only 
expected to become increasingly 
volatile. By integrating internal 
carbon pricing with investment 
decisions, the University can avoid 
future losses from the fossil fuel 
industry and stay in line with the 
Paris Agreement while emerging as a 
climate leader.

Regent 
Mark 
Bernstein 
(D) 

stated so himself in the Wall Street 
Journal: “We have to do everything 
we possibly can to disrupt the flow of 
carbon into the atmosphere, and that 
includes disrupting the flow of capital 
to the fossil-fuel industry.” 

We can leverage divestment to 

inspire new research across campus, 
increase 
shareholder 
power 
in 

up-and-coming 
technology 
and 

eliminate our dependence on and 
support for the fossil fuel industry. 
With the support of an internal 
carbon 
pricing 
initiative, 
the 

University can harness the power 
of market-based solutions to meet 
decarbonization goals and address 
climate change head-on. It’s time to 
prove that we are the high-caliber 
institute we claim to be.

***
As we wait for the Regents to share 

“concrete next steps” in the planned 
transition to a low-carbon economy, 
let’s not slow our momentum. Until 
then, here are links to the CAM Petition, 
to the CCL Nationals and to ESG.

PHILIP EIL | OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR

I 

didn’t know much about the Freedom 
of Information Act when I was 
an undergrad at the University of 

Michigan. I was too busy drinking beer, 
screaming myself hoarse on Saturdays at the 
Big House and trying (in vain) to keep up with 
the readings for my English major classes on 
the American novel and Jane Austen. But not 
long after graduating and pursuing a career 
in journalism, I became entangled in a years-
long battle over public records that stemmed 
from a true crime book I was — and still 
am — trying to write about a medical school 
classmate of my dad who was sentenced to life 
in prison for prescription drug-dealing. Once 
the trial ended in that case, my seemingly-
straightforward requests to see the evidence 
were met with denials, delays, arbitrary fees 
and excessive redactions. All told, it took me 
more than five years and the help of two pro 
bono attorneys to wrestle those exhibits free. 

This years-long battle for access to evidence 

from a high profile trial — which I once called 
“the single most disillusioning experience 
of my life” — turned me into a FOIA Guy: 
someone who writes, talks and tweets about 
government transparency, and, in one case, 
flew to Brazil to appear on a panel about access 
to public records. 

So I was disturbed by a story from earlier 

this month, first reported in the Washington 
Post and then in The Michigan Daily, about 
University President Mark Schlissel and other 
Big Ten school administrators’ attempts to 
shield their deliberations about how to handle 
last year’s mid-pandemic football season from 

public view. As the Post reported, Schlissel 
suggested moving the conversation to a private 
Big Ten-affiliated communication system that 
isn’t subject to transparency laws, and at one 
point asked University of Wisconsin Chancellor 
Rebecca Blank, “If you simply delete emails 
after sending, does that relieve you of FOIA 
obligations?” When she explained that deleting 
emails would be a breach of records laws, 
Schlissel responded, “That’s really interesting 
and difficult. Thanks for explaining.” 

By now, other transparency advocates have 

weighed in on this story. Adam Marshall, an 
attorney for the Reporters Committee for 
Freedom of the Press interviewed by the Post, 
called the behavior from top administrators 
“shocking” and “troubling.” On Twitter, 
Ted Bridis, a former Associated Press 
investigative reporter who teaches journalism 
at the University of Florida, described it as 
“outrageous.” But, in my capacity as a lifelong 
Wolverine and a public records nerd, I wanted 
to weigh in on why I was bothered by it — and 
why you should be, too.

First, a bit of background. The Freedom 

of Information Act is far more than just a 
punchline from the movie Dodgeball. Since 
the law’s passage in 1966, it has helped perform 
the invaluable democratic service of revealing 
uncomfortable truths about our society. The 
FOIA has helped inform us about the FBI’s 
campaign to surveil and subvert Martin 
Luther King Jr., the force-feeding of detainees 
at Guantanamo Bay, the Pentagon’s arming of 
local police departments with military-grade 
weaponry and sillier things like complaints 

about Amtrak’s cafeteria cars. 

As I recently reported for Columbia 

Journalism Review, over the last four years, 
the FOIA helped expose some of the worst 
corruption and dishonesty of the Trump era. 
In 1985, the late New York Times columnist 
William Safire wrote that the law “has done 
more to inhibit the abuse of Government 
power and to protect the citizen from 
unlawful snooping and arrogant harassment 
than any legislation in our lifetime.”

One of the FOIA’s most important legacies 

is the fact that it inspired 50 similar state-
level laws in the decades after its passage. 
In 2015, freelance journalist Brandon Smith 
used the Illinois Freedom of Information Act 
to pry free a previously-withheld dashcam 
video of Chicago police fatally shooting a 
black teenager, Laquan McDonald, which 
led to a series of reforms, resignations and 
criminal charges. More recently, state-level 
records laws helped high school students in 
Kentucky publish a police-training slideshow 
that favorably quoted Adolf Hitler; there, too, a 
high-profile resignation followed.

Michigan’s Freedom of 
Information 
law 

was passed in 1976, and because the University 
of Michigan is a public institution, the school 
is subject to requests. (You can read more 
about this via this page from the provost’s 
office.) This has led to the publication of 
the contracts for Jim Harbaugh and former 
men’s basketball coach John Beilein, and 
valuable reporting by The Daily on pricey non-
disclosure agreements offered by the school to 
former employees and hefty fees charged for 

the fulfillment of records requests. 

And this is the kind of transparency that 

Schlissel was trying to evade. 

While Schlissel’s words are bad enough 

on their own, there are two additional things 
worth highlighting. First is that Schlissel 
occupies a position of enormous power: As 
of 2018, he took home a salary of more than 
$850,000 and he leads an institution with tens 
of thousands of students and employees, a $9 
billion operating budget and its own police 
force. He is, functionally speaking, a politician. 
(He’s also a trained physician and medical 
researcher, which adds an interesting layer to 
his COVID-19 response.) 

Moreover, the Big Ten’s move to cancel the 

football season, and then reverse course, was a 
decision that affected the lives of players, fans, 
coaches and countless others, and involved 
tens of millions of dollars in potential revenue. 
Additionally, it even included America’s 
demagogic president, Donald Trump, who 
had turned the season’s un-cancellation into a 
talking point. It was, in other words, the perfect 
example of why freedom of information laws 
exist: to provide a check on powerful people 
making decisions of great public importance. 
For Schlissel to try to evade those laws not only 
reveals a disturbing ignorance of, or antipathy 
toward, laws that protect the public’s right to 
know, but it also raises the question of what 
other conversations and decisions he might be 
trying to shield from legal public oversight. 

Though we’re only a few months into 

2021, these actions make Schlissel a leading 
candidate for one of this year’s “awards” 

from transparency-focused organizations 
for FOIA failures. (In 2019, Michigan State 
University received a “Golden Padlock” 
from Investigative Reporters and Editors for 
its “unrelenting commitment to ensuring 
transparency was avoided” with regard to 
the serial sex offender and disgraced USA 
Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar.) 

Embarrassing as this episode is, though, 

Schlissel’s FOIA flub can be turned into a 
teachable moment if it inspires folks to educate 
themselves on national and state-level freedom 
of information laws. As a starting point, I 
recommend one of MuckRock’s anthologies 
of FOIA-produced documents, historian Jon 
Wiener’s book about his decades-long fight 
for the release of John Lennon’s FBI file, the 
Freedom of the Press Foundation’s Twitter 
“FOIA Feed” or Article 19’s FOI-law training 
manual for public officials. Perhaps this 
incident will even inspire you to file a request 
of your own, or write to Schlissel to express 
your disappointment. 

More than anything else, this moment is 

a reminder of something I didn’t grasp until 
years after leaving the University: Public access 
to records is as vital a democratic principle 
as anything enshrined in the Bill of Rights. 
Any attempt to evade such laws is behavior 
unbecoming of the president of a school that 
calls itself the “Leaders and the Best.”

n the year since the COVID-19 pandemic 
hit Michigan, 63% of Michigan’s prison 
population has tested positive for the 

virus and 139 people have died. In total, 
more than 25,900 incarcerated people and 
3,800 corrections staff have tested positive. 
Incarcerated people are routinely exposed to 
illness and unable to follow Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention guidance in cramped, 
shared spaces. Sanitation and ventilation are 
inadequate, and quarantine practices have 
been lackadaisical. Additionally, visitation to 
all Michigan prisons has been suspended since 
March 13, 2020. 

Advocates have been urging the Michigan 

Department of Corrections to take meaningful 
action to contain the virus since the pandemic 
began. A white paper published last summer 
by researchers from the American Friends 
Service Committee and the University 
of Michigan, of which I was a co-author, 
detailed the dire conditions. Nearly 300 pages 
of prisoner letters showed example after 
example of horrifying conditions of facilities 
compromising their safety day to day. 

A year later, not much has changed. Cases 

surged again in November, and Michigan now 
ranks first in the nation in COVID-19 cases per 
10,000 prisoners. 

What was true then is still true today. 

MDOC’s response is inadequate, but in fact, 
no safe pandemic response is possible, given 
the existing unsafe conditions in Michigan’s 
prisons even before the pandemic. And due 
to their continued inaction, new outbreaks 
are still ongoing. Meanwhile, MDOC claims 
to be taking additional safety measures and 
denies responsibility for officer deaths. Letters 
from the inside, however, suggest that MDOC 
is more concerned with its public image than 
with the well-being of those in its custody. 

Action could and should have been taken 

a year ago. As long as prisons are hotbeds of 
transmission, the whole state of Michigan 
remains at risk. The only response that truly 
supports public health is reducing our prison 
population and removing as many people as 
possible from this hazardous environment.

Masks and Cleaning Supplies. In prison, 

mask use is expected at all times, except while 
eating, sleeping or showering. According to 
the letters, many incarcerated people received 
only two masks, not three as MDOC claimed. 
Officers have written misconduct tickets 
aggressively for mask non-compliance while 

failing to wear the masks properly themselves. 
Masks have become one more tool for officers 
to wield power over prisoners and make 
incarceration even more punitive.

Additionally, according to MDOC, “cleaning 

products are available to clean commonly-used 
areas and phones before and after use” and “all 
prisoner areas and bathrooms have plentiful 
access to soap.” But at Chippewa Correctional 
Facility in Kincheloe, Mich., Jody Hill reported 
that no additional soap was available. Regarding 
bleach, “the officers just spray it a couple of times 
on one rag and give it to the porter. Then he uses 
the same rag to go around and wipe every single 
thing.” Toilet paper too was carefully rationed.

Social 
Distancing, 
Meals 
and 

Ventilation. In a two-person cell or an eight-
person cube or a 160-bed pole barn (large 
buildings housing low-security prisoners 
in open dormitory-style bunks), the living 
quarters are so close that social distancing is 
impossible. While it is true that fewer people 
are allowed into the chow hall at one time, 
meals are rushed, served at odd hours and 
nutritionally inadequate. At many facilities, it 
appears that no one disinfects the dining area 
between uses. 

Many prisoners report receiving half 

portions or even less. Vegetarians like juvenile 
lifer (a person sentenced to life without parole 
while still under 18) Yusef “Q” Qualls, have it 
even worse: “They make these bean patties 
using leftover veggies & sometimes leftover 
beans too. … They make them then stick them 
in the freezer until they need them, then then 
they reheat them & serve them to us… They are 
either soggy, or they are dust.” The resulting 
widespread hunger has also contributed to 
rising tensions.

Ventilation issues abound as well. In the 

Upper Peninsula’s overcrowded pole barns, 
summertime temperatures reached up to 
100 degrees Fahrenheit. But MDOC directed 
Kinross Correctional Facility in Kincheloe, 
Mich., to shut off all its fans, supposedly 
to prevent cross-contamination between 
quarantined and non-quarantined air. 

At Macomb Correctional Facility in Lenox 

Township, Mich., quarantined units were not 
allowed outdoors at all for over a month. The 
lack of fresh air and exercise compounded 
prisoners’ stress levels. At the Michigan 
Reformatory in Ionia, Mich., a 30-person brawl 
broke out in the yard over the use of a fan. Issues 
like these have no easy fixes: They are built into 

the very architecture of the prison. 

Testing and Quarantine. MDOC has 

performed over 800,000 tests for COVID-
19 and maintains an information repository 
on Medium showing coronavirus numbers 
by facility. But prison crowding and poor 
quarantine practices mean that all that testing 
has done little to curb the spread of the virus.

Gus Harrison Correctional Facility in 

Adrian, Mich., managed to avoid an outbreak 
until early April, when MDOC decided to 
transfer prisoners who had tested positive at 
several other facilities to a satellite unit there. 

Within a week, several men fell ill. Within 

a month, over 600 people at Gus Harrison had 
tested positive. By now, out of 1,955 prisoners 
tested at Gus Harrison, 1,466, or 75%, have 
tested positive. After an officer died of COVID-
19, the facility was investigated and ultimately 
fined for failing to adhere to safety measures.

And the numbers get even worse: at 

Chippewa, Kinross, Carson City Correctional 
Facility, Marquette Branch Prison, Michigan 
Reformatory, Muskegon Correctional Facility 
and Newberry Correctional Facility, over 
80% of the incarcerated population has tested 
positive. 

The lack of safe quarantine spaces results 

in inhumane conditions for those who 
test positive. At Women’s Huron Valley in 
Ypsilanti, Mich., prisoners who tested positive 
were placed into segregation, and in other 
places, they were quarantined in the field 
house. While in separation, they received 
no toilet paper, blankets or shower access. 
At Macomb, prisoners were transferred 
in and out of quarantine with little regard 
for their symptom status, leading to cross-
contamination. 

At 21 of Michigan’s prisons, over 100 staff 

have tested positive. But that doesn’t mean 
sick staff are staying home. Incarcerated 
people across the state have reported that staff 
were working while actively symptomatic. 
Likewise, incarcerated people with jobs like 
food preparation or sanitation have continued 
to work for 17.5 to 32.5 cents per hour while 
symptomatic, for fear of losing their job or 
being sent to isolation.

Medical Care and Visitation. Long before 

the pandemic, incarcerated people have 
had to deal with substandard medical care. 
Now, many are unwilling to admit feeling 
sick, while others die after repeated medical 
requests go ignored. People who are sick must 

pay a $5 copay (equivalent to $300 
in free-world earnings at minimum 
wage) to see a nurse. They generally 
receive only Tylenol, so many 
don’t bother. MDOC is required to 
provide only a minimum standard 
of care and has a history of denying 
patients costly treatments.

No one in Michigan’s prisons 

has seen their family for a year. 
Programming has been canceled, 
including in-person educational 
programming 
and 
treatment 

programs required for parole. 
For a few months, prisoners were 
allowed two free, five-minute 
phone calls per week. 

Now, 
incarcerated 
people 

receive two JPay stamps and some 
fee reductions, but this hardly 
compensates for the gaps left by the 
protracted lack of visitation or programming. 
This is one area where there has been some 
improvement: Video visits have been rolling 
out at some facilities since October, and on 
March 12, MDOC announced that modified 
in-person visitation will resume this Friday. 
While this is a step in the right direction, it 
does not negate the trauma of a year’s isolation 
from their loved ones.

Summary. Prisons are liabilities to 

public health at the best of times. Prior to the 
pandemic, Michigan has suspended visitation 
during outbreaks of influenza and scabies. In 
2019, a group of women incarcerated at the 
Women’s Huron Valley Correctional Facility 
filed a federal lawsuit over a long-standing 
black mold infestation. 

The introduction of COVID-19 into this 

already hazardous environment is a recipe 
for disaster. Vaccination, while necessary to 
control this particular outbreak, is not enough. 
The same conditions that have made COVID-
19 so severe in correctional facilities will leave 
prisons equally vulnerable to the next public 
health crisis. None of this can be addressed 
while MDOC continues to evade responsibility 
for its bungled pandemic response. 

So, what can be done?
First, immediately reduce the prison 

population through executive clemency. 
Overcrowded pole barns pose a particular 
risk. 
Reducing 
eight-person 
cubes 
to 

double occupancy would allow for a greater 
possibility of physical distancing. The 

governor should also issue an executive order 
requiring MDOC to calculate the statutory 
parole guidelines for anyone who has served 
at least 15 years of a life or long-term sentence. 
This would make more people eligible for 
a parole review, especially those who have 
already served many years. In January, the 
Michigan State Appellate Defender Office 
recommended several other ways to increase 
paroles and commutations.

Second, cease processing new people 

into such a high-risk environment. This 
moment is a prime opportunity for judges and 
prosecutors to seriously consider alternatives 
to incarceration. Similarly, reducing arrests 
for traffic tickets and other minor offenses 
will reduce jail cycling, a prime factor in 
community spread. Because unsafe conditions 
in prison facilitate community spread through 
corrections staff, they are a threat to public 
health in the free world, too. 

Even a mass vaccination program in 

MDOC will be only a Band-Aid on the deeper 
problem we must face: that our prisons are 
inhumane, unsafe, cruel and a health risk to 
us all. The only long-term solution is one that 
reduces the size and scope of the carceral 
system and builds a safer and more just 
alternative.

V

oter turnout in the November 
2020 election was the highest 
in American history with over 

158 million people voting. However, 
instead of celebrating this increased 
electoral 
participation, 
Republican 

state legislatures across the country are 
enacting laws to make it harder to vote in 
a blatant attempt to support Republican 
candidates by disenfranchising voters. 

Due 
to 
COVID-19, 
many 
states 

expanded early and absentee voting, which 
made voting much more accessible. In 
typical years, finding time to vote had been 
very difficult for many. Election Day falling 
on a Tuesday hurts many voters, especially 
hourly workers who may not be able to take 
time off of work or find child care. Voters 
without access to reliable transportation 
also face barriers making their way to the 
polls. The additional options of absentee 
and early voting alleviated these issues and 
made it much easier to vote. 

Despite these clear benefits, Republican 

state legislatures across the country are 
attempting to enact new legislation to 
restrict absentee and early voting to make 
it harder in general for people to vote. 

Georgia is one of the states at the 

forefront of this effort to restrict enhanced 
voting access. In 2020, Georgia surprised 
the nation by going blue in the presidential 
election for the first time since 1992. 
Georgia voters provided another political 
upset in early 2021 when they elected Sens. 
Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., and Raphael Warnock, 
D-Ga., in the Senate runoff. These two 
critical wins flipped control of the United 
States Senate to the Democrats. 

In the wake of these defeats, Georgia’s 

Republican-controlled state Senate has 
passed legislation that specifically targets 
Democratic voters by making it more 
difficult to vote absentee. These bills, 
among other things, restrict who can 
use an absentee ballot, shorten the early 
voting period and limit the number of 
absentee ballot drop boxes. 

Sixteen years ago, Republicans in 

Georgia 
passed 
no-excuse 
absentee 

voting, which allowed anyone to vote 
absentee without a reason. However, now 
the Republican legislature is attempting 
to reverse this policy and require voters 
to have a specific excuse to receive an 
absentee ballot. This change is clearly 
in response to the increasing number of 
Democrats in Georgia who prefer to vote 
by mail, which the state GOP views as a 
threat against their attempt to reclaim and 
retain office.

The election bills in Georgia are 

especially concerning as they also promote 
disenfranchisement for voters of color. 
African Americans are one of the largest 
Democratic voting blocs in Georgia. One 
of the most successful mobilization efforts 

of African-American voters is the Souls 
to the Polls program, where parishioners 
would go to vote together after their 
Sunday morning church services. 

In the 2020 election, African Americans 

made up a higher percentage of Sunday 
voting than other days of early voting. The 
proposed Georgia legislation would allow 
counties to not hold early voting on Sundays, 
severely damaging the Souls to the Polls 
program. Stacy Abrams, Georgia voting 
rights activist, has emphasized the racial 
aspects of the Georgia bill, calling it and 
similar bills, “Jim Crow in a suit and tie.”

Other states have also taken steps 

to restrict voting access. In Iowa, the 
Republican governor signed legislation 
that shortens the early voting period, 
requires absentee ballots to be received 
rather than just postmarked by Election 
Day and makes the polls close an hour 
earlier at 8 p.m. Another very concerning 
aspect of the Iowa legislation is that 
voters who skip a general election and 
don’t register again will be purged from 
voter lists. This provision will lead to 
the disenfranchisement of many voters 
who likely will not know that they were 
unregistered if they miss an election. 

Arizona, another state that flipped for 

President Joe Biden, has also advanced 
new voting restrictions. They have 
attempted to pass legislation that would 
reduce the number of absentee voters 
and require additional identification for 
absentee voting. A state representative in 
Arizona recently went viral for comments 
saying that Republicans “don’t mind 
putting security measures in that won’t let 
everybody vote — but everybody shouldn’t 
be voting.” 

This statement demonstrates the clear 

motivations of Republicans in these states 
and potentially others. They are not actually 
concerned about the nonexistent voter 
fraud. Instead, they saw how increased 
voter participation led to Democratic wins. 
However, instead of trying to motivate their 
own voters, Republican state legislatures 
are targeting voting rights and attempting 
to make it harder to vote.

In order to address this issue, the U.S. 

Congress must pass the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. This bill, named 
after the late civil rights icon U.S Rep. 
John Lewis, D-Ga., would strengthen the 
Voting Rights Act and help combat voter 
suppression. This bill is our best option to 
stand up to disenfranchisement. 

The right to vote is one of the most 

sacred rights we have. For anyone in our 
government to restrict those rights for 
political gain is unconscionable and must 
be opposed at every level. 

Continued voter suppression

T

he Atlanta murders have drawn long 
overdue attention to the problems 
Asian women face with racist and 

heteropatriarchal violence. Because this broader 
subject has been a focus of my intersectional 
scholarship over the past three decades, I will 
have more to say about these matters. The 
following article, written before the Atlanta 
murders, addresses the problem of gaslighting 
that has become a central concern of Asian 
American women as the police, politicians and 
media have questioned whether the murders 
were racially motivated.

Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic governor 

of New York, is facing calls to resign and an 
impeachment inquiry after multiple women 
have come forward with complaints of sexual 
harassment and inappropriate behavior. 

Since 2016, we have watched Donald Trump 

rise to the presidency and command loyalty from 
leading Republican Party figures despite a long 
record of misogynistic and racist statements on 
top of numerous allegations of sexual assault and 
harassment. Getting Trump out of the White 
House was thus a necessary and important step. 
For all who care about social justice, however, we 
know that the struggle is far from over. We can’t 
let a focus on Trump’s horrific conduct preclude 
us from seeing the systemic problems we must 
address. Indeed, institutions with a liberal 
reputation often use rhetorical commitments to 
diversity, equity and inclusion as a smokescreen 
for deep, structural problems with how they 
handle sexual misconduct, including retaliation 
against complainants and survivors. 

Earlier this academic year, I accepted a request 

from the United Asian American Organizations 
to serve as a faculty ally and advocate for student 
survivors of sexual assault and harassment. 
In carrying out this work, I do so as part of my 
general public advocacy against discrimination 
and harassment and without singling out any 
person or entity as the sole example. 

Our advocacy for survivors must address 

the central problem of retaliation. For instance, 
the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission has reported that “75% of employees 
who spoke out against workplace mistreatment 
faced some form of retaliation.” We need to 
recognize that lawyers, administrators and 
behind-the-scenes officials who claim to care 
about survivors are frequently acting to uphold 
the status quo that protects offenders and 
perpetuates rape culture. 

Individuals and institutions facing charges of 

sexual assault and harassment often deliberately 
hire women defense attorneys to give the 
appearance of sympathy with survivors. Indeed, 
there is a perverse form of marketing and 
branding within corporate law firms to present 
white women and people of color as gender 
and race experts to help wealthy and powerful 
clients fight off sexual misconduct or civil rights 
complaints. 

One of the most notorious examples in 

recent history was Lisa Bloom’s work on behalf 
of Harvey Weinstein. The daughter of the 
prominent feminist attorney Gloria Allred, Bloom 
built her own national reputation as a media 
figure and attorney advocating for survivors of 
sexual harassment and abuse. Bloom offered all 
of that expertise, including intimate knowledge 
of how to prey on the vulnerabilities of survivors, 
in the service of helping Weinstein destroy his 
accusers at the rate of $895 an hour.

Bloom’s 
retaliation 
strategy 
memo 
to 

Weinstein, uncovered by New York Times 
reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, 
provides what a Quartz article called “a roadmap 
for how accused predators stay in power.” It 
should be studied by anyone seeking a better 
understanding of any institution that has covered 
up rampant problems with sexual assault. 

Bloom began by telling Weinstein, “I feel 

equipped to help you against the Roses of the 
world, because I have represented so many of 
them.” 

Although “(t)hey start out as impressive, 

bold women,” Bloom knew how to expose their 
“weaknesses.” The step-by-step process begins 
with “friendly contact” with the survivor to 
discern what she wants, while simultaneously 
carrying out a “(c)ounterops online campaign” 
to seed “well placed articles” that “push back and 
call her out as a pathological liar.” 

Bloom also proposed using hardball legal 

tactics to intimidate survivors, while offering 
to partner with Weinstein on a “pre-emptive 
interview” that would make him appear “the 
hero” of his story by demonstrating his professed 
empathy. The “headline-grabbing” hero stories 
would go even further with the next step: starting 
a charitable organization dedicated to gender 
equity or pledging to increase the representation 
of women in film. 

Although Bloom has since apologized, Rose 

McGowan, one of the Weinstein survivors, 
responded, “The evil that was perpetrated on me 
and others was mind bending and illegal. Lisa 
Bloom should be disbarred.” Sadly, disbarring 
Bloom would only lead to someone just like her 
filling that void.

Famed liberal attorney David Boies, who 

represented Al Gore in Bush v. Gore and 
successfully brought the issue of marriage 
equality to the Supreme Court, had a longer 
business and legal relationship with Weinstein 
that has led him to be viewed as a key “enabler.” 
Boies arranged for ex-military intelligence 
operatives to run “an undercover surveillance 
operation targeting journalists and alleged 
Weinstein victims.” 

These are the types of memos the public 

rarely sees because they are generally shielded 
by attorney-client privilege. But we’ve witnessed 
more than enough examples of institutional 
misconduct to be skeptical of all internal 
investigations and PR statements of reform. 

Larry Nassar’s survivors were gaslit by a 

sham Title IX investigation that was followed 
by the investigator being promoted to work in 
the Michigan State University Office of General 
Counsel. Thus, the ostensibly neutral Title IX 
investigator was put in a position where her inside 
knowledge of survivors and their complaints 
could be deployed to aid MSU’s defense against 
expected lawsuits. The Nassar case should raise 
alarms about the prospect of purportedly neutral 
“institutional equity” offices directly or indirectly 
collaborating with the attorneys representing the 
broader institution. 

At the University of Oregon, at least two 

students who went to the campus counseling 
center for assistance dealing with reported 
rapes later discovered that university defense 
attorneys accessed their patient records. Citing 
a loophole in the Family Educational Rights and 
Privacy Act or Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act privacy laws, the university 
lawyers compelled the counseling center to turn 
over private clinical records — all without the 
knowledge or consent of the survivors. 

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. Suzanne 

Bonamici, D-Ore., stated, “The last thing sexual 
assault victims should have to think about is 
whether their own words could be used against 
them when they seek help.” These incidents raised 
red flag warnings for survivors of sexual assault, 
racism and other protected class violations to 
be wary of what they tell any employee of an 
institution in which they have been harmed. 

As a faculty member who has focused on 

race and gender equity throughout my 21-year 
career at the University of Michigan, I am 
committed to promoting truly independent 
methods of investigation that get to the root 
cause of problems without the conflicts of 
interest we have seen in the examples above and 
too many other cases nationwide. For example, 
GRACE provides third-party investigations into 
patterns of abuse within churches, employing 
professionally trained staff who address both 
individual and institutional accountability. At 
my alma mater, the University of California, 
Los Angeles, multiple civil rights complaints 
led to the formation of a systemic investigation 
led by a retired federal judge followed by an 
implementation 
agreement 
for 
structural 

reform with then-Attorney General Kamala 
Harris.

While this is just a start, it is the type of work 

that must take precedence over performative 
acts and token measures in order to hold those 
wielding power accountable. It is the least we owe 
survivors and our ancestors who never received 
justice. 

Gaslighting and retaliating against survivors are 

systemic, bipartisan problems

T

he first semester of my se-
nior year was, academically, 
the worst semester of my life. 

I was enrolled in only six credits but 
found myself in a deep depression spi-
ral, unable to do anything — to focus, 
do any work, care about my passions 
like writing and The Michigan Daily, 
but mostly I couldn’t take good care of 
myself.

Writing and photography are the 

only things that come naturally to me 
and are what I want to spend my life 
doing. But when my journalism pro-
fessor messaged me on Slack to say, 
“We missed you in class today. Could 
you respond to this message so I know 
you’re okay?,” my partner had to draft 
a response as I drifted away, lost in the 
shame and embarrassment of it all. 

“I can’t have another semester like 

this one,” I said to her after she sent 
the message.

“I know. You also don’t have to. It 

doesn’t have to be this bad,” she said. 

And after months of resisting, be-

lieving I deserved it all, that was the 
advice that clicked. I made a psy-
chiatry appointment to see what was 
happening in my head. Hopefully a 
doctor would know. It was certainly 
a deep depression slump, something I 
know well, but also a new surprise: an 
ADHD diagnosis. Combined, the two 
knew exactly how to turn my brain 
into scrambled eggs, but I didn’t be-
lieve the therapist, and I didn’t want 
medication. 

How can a deficiency of norepi-

nephrine in my brain cause me to lose 
my object permanence; brown out or 
dissociate during sober, everyday con-
versations; forget to eat and struggle 
to even start basic tasks? I understand 
the chemical imbalance of my depres-
sion, and I’m finally starting to accept 
that it is, in fact, an imbalance, and not 
me making it up. But the day I was di-
agnosed with ADHD, I left the Zoom 
call, closed my laptop, and thought, 
I know ADHD exists, and I wouldn’t 
doubt someone else who has it, but for 
me, it’s not real. The therapist was 
personable and the session informal. 
I sat there fidgeting, worrying I was 
wasting her time, wasting insurance 
money and calling attention to myself. 

My partner, of course, found the 

right words again: 

“Whether or not you believe the 

diagnosis, or whatever the diagnosis 
is, you just don’t have to struggle like 
that,” she said. That’s true, I thought. 
I can accept the help while retaining 
the stubbornness my mother gave me. 

“I’ll try medication temporarily,” I 

said, “But this isn’t a long-term thing. 
And I don’t believe that everyone’s 
brain doesn’t work like this.” 

I’ve watched my mother’s organi-

zational habits my entire life, haunted 
by her ability to just cross things off 
lists and get things done. Coupled 
with her inability to understand how 
I can’t just do the same, I’ve chalked 
it up to having less self-discipline. I’ve 
come back to the feelings of laziness 
and incompetence. 

Or, people will scoff at the topic 

and say something along the lines of, 
“Well, now everyone has ADHD ap-
parently. Did you know that diagnoses 
have skyrocketed lately? It’s just ridic-
ulous.” There’s even an Atlantic article 
professing that ADHD is actually just 
childhood narcissism. But in reality, 
there are around 4 million, or about 
50-75% of women, living undiagnosed 
with ADHD in the United States. 

There are two realms of the disor-

der: hyperactive and inattentive. Hy-
peractive is the stereotypical image of 
a young boy who can’t sit still in his 
seat, is loud and can’t focus enough 
to get work done. This demographic 
was the preliminary demographic for 
the first ADHD clinical studies in the 
1970s. In her Atlantic article “ADHD 
is Different for Women,” Maria Ya-
goda quoted Dr. Ellen Littman, who 
explained these initial studies.

“These studies were based on re-

ally hyperactive young white boys 
who were taken to clinics,” Littman 
said “The diagnostic criteria were 
developed based on those studies. As 
a result, those criteria over-represent 
the symptoms you see in young boys, 
making it difficult for girls to be diag-
nosed unless they behave like hyper-
active boys.” 

But for women, ADHD may pres-

ent itself differently. Dr. Priti Shah, a 
professor of psychology at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, explained to me 
that women are more prone to the 
inattentive type of ADHD, making us 
more forgetful, scattered, sometimes 
impulsive and, more importantly for 
diagnosis, introverted. I call it my 
scrambled egg brain. And it wasn’t 
until reading this article that I real-
ized how much cultural expectations 
for girls had delayed my diagnosis. 

“Whereas boys with ADHD tend 

to externalize their frustration, blam-
ing the ‘stupid test,’ acting up and act-
ing out, girls are more likely to blame 
themselves, turning their anger and 
pain inward,”Rae Jacobson of the 
Child Mind Institute writes. “Girls 
with ADHD are significantly more 
likely to experience major depression, 
anxiety and eating disorders than girls 
without.”

All of this results in later diagnoses, 

conflation with other mental health 
issues and a starkly shaped self-es-
teem for young women. 

“It’s this sense of not being able to 

hold everything together,” Littman 
said. 

Art & Design junior Erin Ruark be-

gan running into problems during her 
first semester of college. She only pic-
tured the aforementioned stereotypi-
cal ADHD that many of us are used to 
imagining, and that still causes prob-
lems in her coming to terms with her 
own diagnosis. 

“I’m torn between (feeling like) 

an imposter,” Ruark said. “Maybe I’m 
just faking it. Maybe I’m exaggerating 
these problems. Maybe it’s not a big 
deal. And I’m just going to be wasting 
everyone’s time.” 

It was as if she’d plucked the words 

from my own mind.

L

ike many others, I’ve spent a 
decent chunk of the past year 
scrolling through TikTok. I’d 

initially resisted downloading it, but 
a friend made me an account when I 
wasn’t paying attention. So I dipped 
my toe in. 

And I found people living all sorts 

of lives, showing them to others in 
1-minute increments. I stuffed my 
liked videos page with people explain-

ing their mental health symptoms, as 
I slowly realized other people’s brains 
do work like mine. 

One video was a woman with 

ADHD explaining her concept of 
time. “It’s either ‘now,’ or ‘not now,’” 
she said. And again, someone’s expla-
nation clicked. Unless something is 
pressing — as in currently in my hands, 
due in the next hour or in my line of 
sight — it’s part of the “not now.” And 
“not now” tends to be a wasteland of 
forgotten dates and deadlines, unan-
swered texts, unwashed dishes, coffee 
gone cold, leftovers abandoned in the 
microwave, four dramatic lost wallet 
stories, bags of spinach gone moldy 
and Trader Joe’s frozen food for when 
I forget to eat until 6 p.m. 

I explained my theory of time to 

LSA senior Ellie Scott and watched 
her laugh on my computer screen. 

“I’ll clean my room or I’ll eat or 

something,” Scott said. “And then 
I think to myself, why do I have to 
do that again? Didn’t I just clean my 
room, didn’t I just eat lunch? Why is 
my room dirty again? Why am I hun-
gry again? But it turns out (with my 
room) it’s been two weeks and it’s 
been three hours (since I last ate).” 

What began as an interview turned 

into a conversation between two girls 
in their bedrooms, and at times the 
Zoom screen became a mirror. 

I wish, like a lot of other things 

in life, that I could’ve been handed a 
manual next to my diagnosis. “Here 
are the things that are ADHD,” it 
would say. “Mark which ones hap-
pen to you, and now you know why, 
and you can start fixing it.” But that 
obviously didn’t happen — so I made 
my own. It’s a running Notes list in 
my phone called “Is it ADHD or am 
I just weird,” currently resting at 500 
words. It always elicits a laugh when 
other people see me adding to it. But 
I’m genuinely confused at what’s nor-
mal anymore, and since I have ten 
seconds before it becomes “not now,” 
I have to write it down. 

“I constantly have struggles that 

people don’t realize are part of ADHD, 
like I have no object permanence, I 
have tics and am just constantly mov-
ing around … and people think it’s just 
not being able to focus,” Scott told me. 

I agreed. The second half of the 

Notes title seems like a joke, but I 
genuinely don’t know what is normal 
anymore. I’ve spent 22 years in this 
brain — of course it’s all normal to me. 

“It’s just so frustrating and it feels 

very unfair that other people are born 
with normal brains that function and 
have the right amount of chemicals 
and do all the right stuff at the right 
time,” Scott said during our conver-

sation. “And I have to take a bunch of 
pills to even everything out and then 
have to deal with side effects. It’s a 
whole other arena of life that I have to 
constantly monitor.” 

That said, it’s not all bad, of course. 
“There seem to be some strengths 

associated with ADHD,” Shah told 
me. “There has been a lot of specula-
tion over the years that people with 
ADHD are more creative than the 
typical person, and also that they 
sometimes have these special abilities 
to focus even more.”

ADHD and creativity is something 

that sparked Shah’s interest nearly 20 
years ago. She and her team at the Ba-
sic and Applied Cognition Lab began 
studying college students with ADHD 
compared to those without using 
standardized measures of creativity, 
like “thinking of as many uses that 
you can for a bucket,” she said with 
a laugh. The students with ADHD 
had come up with more ideas for the 
bucket and more creative ones than 
the students without. 

But Shah also went on to test real-

life creativity by having two groups 
of students invent a new kind of cell 
phone. And, as she’d expected, the 
group with ADHD “created more 
unique, novel features of cell phones 
and things that hadn’t been invented, 
but were still thought of as useful.” 

“So students with ADHD also had 

greater creative achievement in life,” 
Shah said. “We have a series of papers 
that show that people with ADHD 
performed better on creativity survey 
measures and laboratory tests.” 

Shah and her team also began 

studying hyperfocus, a part of ADHD 
that can be both helpful and harmful. 
My hyperfocus mostly strikes when 
I’m supposed to be doing something 
else — if I have all the time in the 
world to think about my photography, 
it’s more of a task. But if I’m avoiding 
something else, it’s an indulgence. 
Hyperfocus is something that’s com-
monly talked about with ADHD, but 
there wasn’t much research on it until 
a few years ago. 

Consulting with her colleagues, 

Shah developed a scale to measure it, 
and determined that there are both 
positive and negative aspects to ex-
hibiting symptoms of hyperfocus. 

“Sometimes it can be negative, 

when you’re going down a rabbit 
hole on the internet and come out 
and don’t do your homework,” Shah 
said. “But it could also be a positive, 
like you’re able to write a new piece 
of music because you’ve been able to 
focus on it so deeply.”

Ruark told me about her after-

noons spent in the School of Art & De-

sign studios, fueled by her hyperfocus. 
At times, it can be the secret ingredi-
ent in the work process, especially if 
the work is creative. And I wouldn’t 
be able to call myself a writer without 
it, because honestly, I would never fin-
ish an article.

R

uark and I spoke over Zoom, 
of course, and she walked 
me through her thoughts. 

We were diagnosed around the same 
time, but following the statistics, it 
should’ve been much earlier. 

“I first started to suspect things 

back in high school, because I would 
have these moments where I’d be try-
ing to talk to someone one-on-one. I’d 
want to show them that I’m listening 
and be attentive, but I could not stay 
focused during our conversations,” 
Ruark said. “It was really frustrating. 
And I did well in school. I still do well 
on tests. And I was polite. So before I 
was diagnosed, people really doubted 
it a lot.”

“And that was part of what made it 

difficult for me to feel like I should go 
get help,” Ruark continued. 

“It’s a little delegitimizing,” I 

chimed in, too excited that someone 
was sharing my thoughts while trying 
to remember proper interview eti-
quette. “‘You’re doing well in school,’ 
they say. And I’m saying, ‘Yes, but my 
brain is scrambled eggs. It’s not good 
up here!’” 

Ruark’s face lights up on my com-

puter screen. “That’s exactly what I 
say!” she laughs.

I’m at a point now, several months 

into working with a psychiatrist, 
where I’ve started to see improve-
ment. But the stigma around ADHD 
runs deep — far deeper in myself than 
I’d anticipated. I couldn’t do basic 
tasks, like keep track of due dates or 
my keys, and the endless to-do lists 
weren’t helping. But the worst part 
was my explanation for these stresses: 
that they were my fault. I was lazy, 
unmotivated, apathetic and incompe-
tent. Except, I did care. Why couldn’t 
I get the two forces in my brain to 
cooperate? I didn’t want to turn in a 
paper late, but it felt like I wasn’t the 
one in control. I wrote emails to my 
professors, explaining that I did care 
about their class, time, profession and 
respect, and apologized over and over. 
I must just be a bad person.

Shah explained this feeling of op-

erating outside the realm of normal 
and feeling as though it’s our own 
fault.

“We’ve created a school system in a 

world that is really well-designed for 
neurotypical individuals,” Shah said. 
“But I think there are also people that 
will think outside the box, think of an-
other way to do it, will question why 
you’re doing it. I think that there are 
all these strengths that we don’t nec-
essarily value.”

The idea that a person didn’t “care” 

because they didn’t reach expecta-
tions was something I’d internalized 
long ago. It seemed to be the only 
explanation I was offered, and when 
you’re operating like a neurotypical 
among neurotypicals, it’s impossible 
for others to understand something 
like badly wanting to start a paper, but 
feeling physically unable to begin. Or 
forgetting a deadline for your favor-
ite class, and being so consumed by 
letting your professor (and yourself) 
down that you can’t attend the next 
class and look them in the eye.

“I have a really hard time writing 

emails to professors. It’s my worst 
nightmare,” Ruark said. “It’s like, if 
I bring this up now, I’m going to just 
sound like I’m trying to get out of 
something. So sometimes I just don’t 
bring it up. And it’s my fault. But it’s 
also a little bit like a stigma thing and 
a guilt thing?”

“They did not mean me when they said disabled”

BY MARISA WRIGHT, STATEMENT DEPUTY EDITOR

T

hey tell me I look so healthy. They 
tell me I’m just so young. They just 
cannot believe it. They ask me if 

I’m really sick, like am I really sure? They 
ask me if I’ve actually received a diagnosis. 
They tell me it’s in my head, that it’s psy-
chosomatic. They tell me it’s part of being 
a woman. 

There are so many things people tell me 

about my own body. If they’re not telling 
me, they’re second-guessing the informa-
tion and descriptions I share. 

Me disclosing an illness or disability 

that is invisible, which is to say it is not 
observable or evident in any readily appar-
ent sense, often leads to these kinds of re-
actions. Without the ability to observe my 
condition, many people question or refuse 
to believe its validity. 

Aside from any symptoms, the reality 

of living with an invisible condition is that 
people — doctors, family, friends, profes-
sors, coworkers and so on — simply won’t 
believe you. They will label you as over-
dramatic, tell you that you’re just lazy or 
call you a liar. 

LSA senior Cheyanne Killin, who has 

multiple chronic illnesses stemming from 
a rare genetic connective tissue disorder 
called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syn-
drome (hEDS), shared her experience 
with this reality in an email to The Michi-
gan Daily. 

“Because I do not look visibly disabled, 

many people often assume that I’m not 
actually sick, or, worse, that I’m actually 
only mildly sick and exaggerating my con-
ditions for personal gain and/or malicious 
intent,” Killin wrote. 

In medical settings, this kind of disbe-

lief can have extreme consequences. Prop-
er diagnosis and treatment are predicated 
by a doctor taking their patient’s concerns 
and description of symptoms seriously. 
When they don’t, patients can suffer un-
necessarily. 

It is easier for a doctor’s unconscious 

biases to play a greater role in their evalu-
ation and course of treatment, particularly 
when conditions are not visible to a doc-
tor, which is the case for 96% of the nearly 
133 million Americans with at least one 
chronic illness. In this way, a doctor’s bi-
ases about one’s identities can stand in the 
way of proper treatment. 

Doctors are less likely to believe and 

properly treat women’s pain than men’s. 
Doctors also undertreat Black Americans’ 
pain relative to white Americans. Black 
women in particular are harmed by doc-
tors who dismiss their concerns and im-
properly treat them: ProPublica reports 
that “a black woman is 22 percent more 
likely to die from heart disease than a 
white woman, 71 percent more likely to 

perish from cervical cancer, but 243 per-
cent more likely to die from pregnancy- or 
childbirth-related causes.” Doctors’ bias 
against fat people and queer people also 
leads to worse health outcomes. 

Killin has felt this acutely when treated 

by male physicians. 

“I was often told that I was just anx-

ious, stressed, or pregnant,” Killin wrote. 
“If those were negated, like a negative 
pregnancy test, I was just shown the door 
without options or treatment. I’ve been 
sick since October 2017, and I am just now 
finding out exactly what is going on with 
my body.”

For my own primary condition endome-

triosis, patients typically face a diagnostic 
delay of seven to 10 years from the onset of 
disease. In my case, a doctor misdiagnosed 
me with appendicitis — for which I un-
derwent an appendectomy — seven years 
before I received my proper diagnosis of 
endo. For those seven years, my pain was 
untreated and the progression of the dis-
ease continued. 

While part of this diagnostic delay is 

due to doctors’ lack of training on condi-
tions that are traditionally associated with 
the female reproductive system, it is also 
certainly caused in part by doctors who 
dismiss their patient’s pain as “part of be-
ing a woman.”

Art & Design senior Anna DeLuca, who 

has endometriosis and chronic migraines, 
shared a similar experience in trying to re-
ceive a proper diagnosis and having doc-
tors dismiss her pain as a woman. 

“Especially if you initially go in for 

painful periods, you are often dismissed 
because you know, periods are supposed 
to be painful or whatever,” she told me in a 
Zoom interview. 

DeLuca described the impact this dis-

missal had on her.

“And then you’re sort of hit with that 

wall and then you can’t say anything 
else,”DeLuca said. “When you are imme-
diately dismissed I shut down, I feel like 
I sort of I can’t say anything else because 
you know they’re not going to listen and 
so, then you try it again with another doc-
tor and you get the same experience.” 

In addition to complicating diagnosis 

and treatment in medical contexts, the 
pervasiveness of disbelief of invisible con-
ditions affects issues of access to resources 
for chronically ill and disabled people, in-
cluding government benefits and accom-
modations at school or work. At the Uni-
versity of Michigan, the laborious process 
required to prove a need for accommoda-
tions through the Services for Students 
with Disabilities office can leave a lot of 
students out. 

DeLuca explained how the form SSD 

requires to request accommodations is “so 
long” and requires that your doctor com-
plete most of it. When DeLuca needed to 
renew her request with SSD before her 
second year, she was uninsured, so the 
possibility that her doctor might charge 
her for filling out the form meant she 
didn’t feel like she could request accom-
modations through SSD. 

“I couldn’t (get the form completed) in 

time, and at that point, I sort of just looked 
at the reality in front of me,” Deluca said. 
“I felt and still feel like this is not for me. 
They did not mean me when they said dis-
abled.” 

In addition to an arduous process to 

prove one’s disability status, internalized 
ableism about who and what counts as a 
disability can lead to feelings of unworthi-
ness when it comes to seeking accommo-
dations.

Writer and journalist s.e. smith wrote 

about not feeling “‘disabled enough’ 
because there was nothing outwardly 
wrong,” which ultimately meant smith felt 
unable to ask for accommodations. 

The issue of who “counts” as disabled 

has come into sharp focus with the distri-
bution of COVID-19 vaccines. Across the 
United States, vaccine eligibility has been 
structured in phases with the most vul-
nerable receiving the highest priority to 
receive a vaccine. When people with un-
derlying health conditions became eligible 
for the vaccine, young people with invis-
ible conditions subsequently faced inva-
sive questions about why they qualify for 
the vaccine. Their underlying condition 
is not visible, and so others, often able-
bodied people, feel entitled to know their 
personal health information as some sort 
of justification. 

Even within the disability community 

itself, evidence (or the lack thereof ) of an 
illness or disability can create tension.

“Some call it the hierarchy of disability; 

the complex calculus of who is ‘more dis-
abled’ that some people seem to enjoy en-
gaging in,” smith explained. “Those with 
very evident disabilities are at the top of 
this hierarchy, while those who can pass 
as nondisabled are somewhere toward the 
bottom.”

Ann Heffernan, an LSA collegiate fel-

low in the Department of Political Sci-
ence, teaches a course called “Disability: 
A Democratic Dilemma.” She spoke to me 
over Zoom about the effort to include dif-
ferent types of disabilities, such as chronic 
conditions and mental health conditions, 
within the community. 

“The initial disability studies and dis-

ability rights movement tended to privi-
lege visible disabilities, and I think it’s 
only recently — as in the last twenty or 

thirty years — that conditions that are 
disabling that may have varying visibility 
have become part of the analysis of what 
we mean when we talk about disabilities,” 
Heffernan said.

While this historical privilege still plays 

into our conceptions of disability today, 
it is also important to acknowledge that 
there is a different and important kind of 
privilege accorded to those with non-evi-
dent disabilities. 

With disabilities that are evident, stig-

ma is pervasive. Heffernan has cerebral 
palsy and spoke about times in her life 
when she has felt “pressure to not look so 
disabled.” 

For those of us with nonapparent con-

ditions, we can mostly move through the 
world with the ability to pick and choose 
who, how and when we disclose our sta-
tus/conditions. This is advantageous sim-
ply for the sake of privacy, but since dis-
closure of disability status can affect job 
outcomes and relationships, it is also a 
privilege with huge consequences. 

Recognizing this privilege, Killin noted, 

“If I’m in an ableist environment (even 
though it’ll be painful), I carry the privi-
lege of being able to ‘pretend’ that I’m 
able-bodied. I can present research, meet 
professors, go to job interviews, etc., with 
the option of disclosing my disability or 
not.” 

The reason these privileges exist is not 

a hierarchy created or perpetuated by dis-
abled people. They are created by ableism 
in our culture that advantages being able 
to “pass” as able-bodied. It is the same 
ableism that questions people’s lived ex-
periences with chronic illnesses and dis-
abilities just because they aren’t immedi-
ately observable. Ultimately, this problem 
will not be solved if ableism continues to 
be perpetuated, mostly by able-bodied 
people. 

At the end of my interview with DeLuca, 

I asked her what she wishes able-bodied 
people knew about her experience. “I wish 
people had respect for situations or per-
spectives that they do not know anything 
about, and that can be said for so many dif-
ferent identities,” DeLuca responded. “It’s 
just sort of that moment of like, I just want 
to exist peacefully as a disabled person, 
but I cannot, that is not an option.”

After a moment of silent contemplation, 

she went on, “I just want the basic respect 
to not have to explain myself every day for 
you to validate me … I want people to have 
that perspective of even if you are frus-
trated that I need a specific thing, I am in-
finitely more affected by this. And I think 
that kind of just comes down for people 
to understand that this is not about them, 
this is about me.”

F

or people who write regu-
larly, one of the most dis-
heartening experiences is 

that of “writer’s block.” It is an un-
pleasant feeling, to say the least. No 
matter how hard I try, the words do 
not come. Or, they come in fits and 
starts, only to be censored before 
they reach the page. 

Words, the building blocks of 

the written product, seem to reside 
somewhere in my mind. They float 
around up there, waiting for me to 
scoop them up and spread them 
around. But writer’s block is a dam 
for words, gunking up the passage-
way that brings the abstraction of 
thought to fruition in the material 
world.

This is, at least, how I have pic-

tured the problem of writer’s block. 
My fears and anxieties attached to 
writing seem to come from mental 
obstructions. Most of the time, I at-
tribute the lack of consistency and 
clarity in my written work to brain 
fog, tiredness or carelessness. 

At worst, the harshness with 

which I critique my work — even 
while I am still in the process of 
drafting — results in me charging 
myself of intellectual dishonesty; 
not plagiarism, but dissociation 
from my own writing because it 
does not represent what I want to 
say. What you intend to write is full 
of lies, half-truths and sophisms, I 
tell myself, as I continue to stare at 
the blank page in front of me.

Where 
do 
these 
damaging 

thoughts and emotions about my 
writing come from? And where 
might they end?

***
I

n general, I believe my fears 
and anxieties about writ-
ing stem from my equating 

of writing ability to intelligence. I 
have been prone to say that a “bad” 
piece of writing functions as proof 
of an intellectual failure on my part. 
The same can be said of almost any 
exam, test or paper I have turned in: 
These are “tests” in the sense that 
they measure something about me, 
not merely my knowledge about a 
particular subject.

This is a counterproductive way 

of thinking about assignments, aca-
demic or otherwise. It presupposes 
a binary of comprehension — ei-
ther you understand completely, 
or not at all — and obscures the 
role of practice and active engage-
ment with the subject matter at 
hand. Though the ultimate source 
of this “Caesar or nothing” attitude 
towards writing is ambiguous, I do 
have some intuitions about its prov-
enance.

At university, I started to study 

philosophy and began to internal-
ize the long philosophical tradi-
tion of privileging the mind over 
the body. For many philosophers, 
this has amounted to a repudiation 
of the body as the site of innumer-
able aches, pains, lusts and other 
biological 
hindrances. 
Though 

there is debate around this issue, 
Plato often talks about suppressing 
bodily desire in order to cultivate 
the soul [psuchê], which is simi-
lar to our contemporary notion of 
mind as something inanimate and 
potentially transcendent. The same 
themes of denying oneself pleasure 
and ignoring the body are explored 
by later schools of Greek philoso-
phy, early Christian philosophers 
and, in some cases, in the moral 
philosophy of Immanuel Kant.

Though philosophers have had 

a somewhat strained psychologi-
cal relationship with their bod-
ies, many have also been skeptical 
about trusting sense experience al-
together. This elevation of the mind 
over the body can be traced to the 
Platonic theory of forms, though 
in my view it was stated most suc-
cinctly by the French philosopher 
René Descartes in his “Discourse 

on the Method.”

The “Discourse” contains the fa-

mous logical formulation je pense, 
donc je suis, (“I think, therefore I 
am”), the result of the philosopher’s 
search for an indubitable truth. Or, 
rather, in training his sights on pure 
reflection, free of the biases of the 
senses, Descartes seeks the truth 
in avoiding error. Similarly, in the 
“Meditations on First Philosophy,” 
he writes that, in order to avoid de-
ception, “I shall imagine myself as 
if I had no hands, no eyes, no flesh, 
no blood, no senses at all, but as if 
all my belief in these things were 
false.” 

The Cartesian mode of thinking 

amounts to a denial of the role of 
the body in grasping the truth. For 
me, however, this brand of body de-
nial has led to innumerable confu-
sions regarding the articulation of 
thoughts through the process of 
writing — a process that involves 
drawing from the well of pure re-
flection only to sully the waters.

My reading of Descartes here is 

admittedly condensed, though it 
points towards broader questions 
about the relationship between my 
thoughts and my written work. If 
Descartes were in front of me to-
day, I would have two questions for 
him: Why have you dared to write 
philosophy, if writing can only be 
achieved by means of the body? 
Why have you written, given that 
the human body is the cause of so 
many deceptions against human-
ity?

In fact, especially in the “Medi-

tations,” Descartes does describe 
the considerable effort required 
to abandon his old ways of think-
ing that were influenced by bodily 
senses. Despite his best efforts, 
the philosopher admits, “a kind of 
laziness brings me back to what is 
more habitual in my life.” This la-
ziness resembles a half-sleep, one 
in which the dreamer is partially 
aware that he is in a dream but 
wants to preserve the pleasant il-
lusion. Thus, tiredness of the body 
represents an obstacle to contem-
plation. But even in those moments 
where Descartes seems to grasp the 
truth, relying only on his mind, the 
act of writing brings these reflec-
tions into the physical world. How 
did Descartes relate to his arms, his 
quill and ink, his parchment, and 
all the other physical “things” that 
permitted him to communicate his 
ideas to future generations? What 
anxieties may he have held about 
the subjection of the mind, the 
“thinking thing” [res cogitans], to 
the instruments of language, writ-
ing tools and the body itself; the 
material things [res extensa] on 
which writing depends?

I am not sure what Descartes 

thought about the act of writing, 
but I do know other thinkers have 
expressed their reticence about 
it. The 20th century philosopher 
Jacques Derrida, for instance, ex-
pressed anxiety about challenging 
authority in his own writing.

“Nothing intimidates me when 

I write,” he explained in an in-
terview for a documentary. “I say 
what I think must be said.” Howev-
er, Derrida goes on to describe the 
self-doubt that invades his psyche 
when he is away from his papers. 
Especially at the moment when he 
is falling asleep, an internal voice 
admonishes him for his arrogance. 
The philosopher is suddenly seized 
with the destructive desire to burn 
all of his papers and start over.

Fortunately, these moments of 

crisis occurred away from his desk. 
But what if he had allowed those 
moments of censorship to invade 
the practice of writing itself? 

During the act of writing, we 

make decisions about what to say 
and what not to say as we go; there 
is not a clear line between the writ-

ing process and the editing process 
per se. But writer’s block, at least 
for me, represents the counterpro-
ductive disciplining of the mind 
and body in the creative process. 
My block is not just in the mind but 
reverberates throughout my entire 
body. The physical aversion of writ-
ing utensils and devices comple-
ments the mental aversion of error, 
resulting in a perfect storm of stag-
nation.

***
B

reaking 
writer’s 
block, 

then, is not a movement 
that happens solely in the 

mind; the act of writing is just that 
— an act — and must be performed 
at the physical level as well as in the 
quiet of one’s mind.

Perhaps that is not a remarkable 

realization, but for a writer like me 
who is trapped in the equating of 
writing and intellect, it represents 
a way to engage the body in order 
to free the mind. In this framing, 
writing is not a means of liberat-
ing the mind from the body, but of 
strengthening their connection. 
For one way of thinking about writ-
ing is to see it as a neutral medium 
for the presentation of ideas, and 
another is to regard writing as part 
of the process of thinking itself.

Letting oneself write is an act of 

generosity, too, because it allows 
an inner dialogue to materialize 
without immediately censoring 
the outcome of this dialogue in the 
written product. When I am in the 
flow of writing, there is indeed a 
feeling of necessity that drives the 
flushing of words onto a screen 
or wherever else I happen to be 
recording my thoughts. Writing 
anxiety blocks the overall process 
of making my mark on the world 
around me, trapping my thoughts 
“inside” of my body despite my 
will to mark them down some-
where on the outside.

Etymology provides a clue to 

this traditional sense of writing as 
a cutting, marking, or scratching 
of the world which bodies inhabit. 
Roughly speaking, the Old English 
verb writan, as well as the Latin 
scribere, were related to the physi-
cal notion of scoring, outlining or 
drawing. To take a broader view, 
historians believe that the first full 
writing systems in history were 

formed independently between 
3400 and 600 BC, in Mesopota-
mia, Egypt, China and Mesoameri-
ca. The evidence, of course, is from 
the inscriptions of pictures, char-
acters and scripts made onto vari-
ous writing surfaces. These ranged 
from the first clay tablets in Sumer 
to the invention of reed brushes 
and ink in Egypt and beyond.

Writing as “making marks,” 

however, no longer conforms to a 
broad and inclusive conception of 
the craft. Technological advance-
ments have dislodged the histori-
cal connection between writing 
and marking, especially with the 
introduction of typewriters, key-
boards and word processors. Fur-
ther, the ancient practice of dic-
tation, where I verbally dictate 
what I want to write to a scribe, no 
longer has to involve another hu-
man. Modern speech-recognition 
technology such as Dragon Natu-
rallySpeaking provides a techno-
logical method for translating ver-
bal speech into the written word. 
This, too, is writing, according to a 
conception of writing that empha-
sizes the general rapport between 
humans, written expression and 
the mode of written expression, 
without presupposing a particular 
configuration of the three.

History, as well as my own ex-

perience, has shown that writing 
can take on an indefinite number 
of forms. This leaves the definition 
of writing ambiguous, and I think 
that is ultimately a good thing. 
Experimenting with the writing 
process in this open-ended man-
ner has been helpful for me as an 
“un-blocking” mechanism, par-
ticularly by engaging my mind 
with my body. Even though I usu-
ally have Google Docs or Microsoft 
Word open as I write, if I feel stuck 
it helps to scribble on a few Post-
It notes or draw out an outline in 
my journal. Recently, I have taken 
to recording voice memos on my 
phone that I can later use to jog my 
memory. My use of these different 
writing technologies has consti-
tuted a hybrid creative process, 
one that emphases the material-
ization of my ideas rather than the 
protection of their mental purity.

I recognize, however, that the 

employment of these technologies 

as an able-bodied person is a privi-
lege that not all writers enjoy. The 
design of the standard computer 
keyboard, for example, can be an 
impractical writing medium for 
some people with visual or physi-
cal disabilities. These keyboards 
are designed for two-handed typ-
ists, not people with the use of 
one hand; some functions require 
pressing two keys at once, which 
is difficult for people who have 
difficulty with fine motor control; 
small keys and little to no separa-
tion between them present dif-
ficulties for people with motor, 
vision and cognitive difficulties. 
Writing, therefore, is an accessi-
bility issue, though not one that is 
limited to the availability of cer-
tain technologies. The ambiguous 
practice of writing implies a non-
neutrality of writing instruments 
and launches questions about the 
design of things that have become 
a part of many people’s everyday 
lives, but that do not necessarily 
take everyone’s needs and prefer-
ences into account.

***
E

veryone has the right to 
self-expression — writing, 
for example — but not ev-

eryone employs the same means of 
self-expression. The reasons for 
this are not limited to the abilities 
allowed of the body, but it can be 
argued that writing and the body 
are inseparable.

I used to frame writer’s block 

as an obstacle of the mind, but 
reframing it as the engagement 
of the body in a habitual activity 
has increased my sensitivity to the 
possibilities of writing practice. 
Especially in philosophy, there is 
sometimes a tendency to erase, ig-
nore and reproach the body that 
contributes to anxieties about its 
role in intellectual activity.

For me, however, the image of 

the embodied writer represents 
a door to empathy, from writer to 
writer, even though the individual 
writing experience of each re-
mains unique. Nevertheless, here 
is an invitation to reflect on my 
own writing practice and connect 
it to that of others, remaining alto-
gether grateful for the opportunity 
to make my mark, however that 
happens to manifest itself.

Letting the body write

BY ALEXANDER SATOLA, STATEMENT CORRESPONDENT


In an extraordinary year, the 

Michigan hockey team looked like it 

might make it to the end. 

Everything 

the 
world 

could 
have 

thrown at the 

Wolverines, 
it 

did. An insanely 

long 
offseason. 

An 
athletic 

department-

wide shutdown. 

A season-ending injury. At each turn, 

they’ve proven time and again that 

they’re capable of playing through 

unprecedented 
circumstances. 

Sitting as a two seed and the No. 8 

team in the country, they had a real 

shot to make some noise in the NCAA 

Tournament.

But on Friday, just hours before 

the puck dropped on its first game, 

Michigan was forced to withdraw 

from the NCAA Tournament due to 

COVID-19 protocols.

Before anything else, let’s put this 

into perspective. 

The 
Wolverines 
have 
been 

practicing since July. According 

to coach Mel Pearson, the team 

hadn’t had a single case of COVID-

19 between then and the Big Ten 

Tournament. In that span, Michigan 

went through some rough patches 

performance-wise, but ultimately 

entered the postseason with a 

respectable 15-10-1 record and playing 

some of its best hockey.

Then, in an instant, it was over.

For the senior class especially, it’s 

downright tragic. For the second 

straight season, they’ve had a 

promising 
postseason 
campaign 

suddenly 
and 
unceremoniously 

wiped out by the pandemic.

“The first time was really tough 

last year, because it was so sudden, and 

everybody’s healthy, and there’s no 

issues,” Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

said. “Once we found out there was an 

issue within our program (this week), 

you know, all bets are off. I think there 

was some real concern amongst our 

team.”

Last season, nothing could’ve kept 

the season from ending the way it 

did. It was the very beginning of the 

COVID-19 pandemic in the United 

States. A shutdown of college sports 

was, at the time, inevitable. But this 

year? It was entirely avoidable.

As with virtually everything else 

the NCAA has done in 2020 and 

2021, the plan for how to approach 

the college hockey postseason fell 

woefully short. According to the 

NCAA’s Return to Championship 

Guidelines, players were expected to 

test negative prior to departing for the 

tournament, then test negative again 

upon arrival. Any player who tested 

positive would be sent to a designated 

quarantine location for 14 days, along 

with any close contacts. 

But 
disease 
detection 
is 

not 
disease 
prevention. 
The 

expectation, apparently, was that 

the 16 teams would all arrive at their 

respective regional sites and simply 

have no positive tests. Or, if there 

were positive tests, they would 

just be limited to a few players and 

not cause problems with contact 

tracing. That worked for 14 teams, 

but for three others, there was no 

backup plan. 

Sure, there’s no way to completely 

eliminate the risks involved with 

playing a tournament during a 

pandemic, but there are definitely 

ways to mitigate them.

One such way is a mandatory 

quarantine period, a protocol that 

the NCAA has bafflingly refused to 

implement for any of its tournaments. 

It’s really not that complicated: Have 

everyone arrive one to two weeks 

before games are scheduled to start to 

prevent outside contact, test everyone 

each day and isolate anyone who tests 

positive. 

Sure, there would be logistical 

hurdles, and there’s no guarantee 

a quarantine period would have 

prevented Michigan’s removal from 

the tournament. But it’s hard to argue 

that it wouldn’t have helped at this 

stage. It should have happened for 

the men’s and women’s basketball 

tournaments, and it should have 

happened for hockey. 

“Absolutely. (A quarantine period) 

would 
have 
absolutely 
helped,” 

Pearson said. “Now, do I think we 

should do that across all sports? That’s 

above my paygrade, but it absolutely 

would have helped. Or similar to 

basketball, they go into a bubble. But I 

know with expenses, and everything 

else that’s going on — again, that’s way 

above my paygrade.”

In response to a request for 

comment, 
NCAA 
associate 

director of communications Greg 

Johnson referred to the Return 

to Championship Guidelines, the 

NCAA COVID-19 Advisory Group 

and the Resocialization to College 

Sports page.

Pearson 
may 
have 
also 

inadvertently hit on a major issue 

at play: money. Namely, men’s 

basketball draws national attention 

and, thus, brings in more money. 

Of course, the March Madness 

bubble in Indianapolis has its own 

problems, but at least they have a 

bubble.

For more context, the men’s 

basketball tournament had one 

team out of 68 drop out because 

of 
COVID-19. 
For 
the 
men’s 

hockey tournament? Three of 17 

involved teams have withdrawn. 

If the approach for basketball was 

imperfect, the plan for hockey was 

unacceptable.

Part of that comes from a lack 

of central guidance. For most of 

the college hockey season, each 

conference has had its own health 

and safety guidelines and protocols, 

and that didn’t change leading up to 

the tournament. Lacking consistent 

standards across conferences for 

testing and dealing with positives 

can cause confusion for coaches and 

players trying to navigate playing 

hockey during a pandemic.

“I sure wish we could’ve used the 

Big Ten protocols,” Pearson said. “… 

I can’t even tell you what they are in 

the NCAA.”

But at the end of the day, there’s 

no incentive for the NCAA to fix 

its problems. It’s college hockey 

— there’s no massive TV audience 

missing the games, no national 

media calling the league out for 

its failure. If the players spoke out 

about the protocols, they might 

make a few rounds on Twitter, or 

have some student papers or college 

hockey blogs write on it, but that’s 

about it.

And that’s a damn shame, because 

the players are affected all the same, 

regardless of the popularity of the 

sport. Just ask Michigan’s seniors.

How Michigan’s season ended

Leigha Brown comes up just short for Michigan

About 
four 
hours 
before 

the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team’s 

scheduled 
NCAA 
Tournament 

game against Minnesota-Duluth, 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

got a call from assistant sports 

administrator Josh Richelew. He 

knew the news wouldn’t be good.

Richelew 
informed 
Pearson 

that the game would be canceled 

due to a positive COVID-19 test 

and contact tracing within the 

Wolverines’ 
travelling 
party. 

While Pearson was disappointed, 

it didn’t come as much of a surprise 

given the events that transpired in 

the days leading up to Michigan’s 

departure for Fargo.

The Wolverines hadn’t had a 

positive COVID-19 test since the 

beginning of July, but prior to 

leaving for Fargo on Tuesday, a 

Michigan player was left behind 

due to COVID concerns.

“At that point, we knew we 

could have some issues,” Pearson 

said.

But 
when 
the 
Wolverines 

arrived, every member of their 

travelling party tested negative, 

and Michigan athletic trainer 

Brian Brewster took measures to 

ensure that the team would have 

no further issues.

Brewster 
determined 
which 

players were cleared to practice in 

North Dakota and made additional 

hotel arrangements to limit close 

contacts between players. But even 

though everyone with the program 

attempted to keep the Wolverines 

safe in order to allow them to play, 

Pearson clearly had some doubts.

“We’re here,” Pearson said 

following Michigan’s practice on 

Thursday. “Between our athletic 

training department and our 

sports medicine department, they 

just tell me … if we’re good to go. … 

I hope they get to play.”

Later that day, another cloud 

was cast over the game’s status 

when another player experienced 

COVID-19 
symptoms, 
and 
a 

subsequent test came back positive, 

putting the status of Friday’s game 

in question. But even at that point, 

Pearson believed that Michigan 

had enough healthy players to 

field a team.

“At that point we thought we 

were still in good shape,” Pearson 

said. “We had 24-25 healthy 

guys who were testing regularly 

and had no issues. But obviously 

that wasn’t good enough for the 

NCAA.”

Despite the positive test, the 

Wolverines went to sleep on 

Thursday believing that they would 

take the ice against the bulldogs 

on Friday. Prior to Pearson’s 

conversation with Richelew, the 

players were in their hotel rooms, 

preparing for the game like they 

would on any other game day, 

preparing to leave Scheels Arena 

at 12:45.

But at 11:30, Pearson called a 

team meeting to inform his players 

of the cancellation. According to 

him, the team already suspected the 

bad news to come. While the team 

was disheartened, Pearson said 

they handled it well — especially 

the seniors, whose college careers 

may have just come to an end 

following two consecutive seasons 

with abrupt finishes.

“I think initially just shock,” 

Pearson said. “Then comes the 

disappointment obviously about 

the future, what the future holds. 

The first time was really tough last 

year, because it was so sudden. I 

think once we found out there was 

an issue within our program, our 

team, then … there was some real 

concern amongst our team. But I 

think they’ll move forward quickly. 

They’re young, and they have to. 

We can’t change what’s happened, 

but we have a say in what’s going to 

happen in the future and how we 

react to it.”

Put simply, Michigan’s season 

came to a devastating end on 

Friday following a hectic week. In a 

season full of uncertainty due to the 

ongoing pandemic, the Wolverines 

largely avoided any COVID-19 

related issues. But at the worst 

possible time, it all came crashing 

down.

“I just wish we could have 

completed the journey,” Pearson 

said. “Or at least had the opportunity 

to compete on the ice.

“It just is a real shallow feeling 

to be beaten by COVID.”

Leigha Brown dribbled down 

the lane after catching the ball off 

the inbounds pass. Forgoing her 

signature mid-range jumper, the 

junior wing brought the ball all the 

way down to the block for a layup.

The ball rolled out of her hands 

and into the hoop with just 19 

seconds left in overtime. Down 

by three, the Michigan women’s 

basketball team needed someone to 

step up and make a big play. Brown, 

like she’d done all second half, was 

the one to do so.

Though the No. 6 seed Wolverines 

would end up losing 78-75 to No. 2 

seed Baylor, Brown’s second half 

nearly powered them to another 

upset.

In 
the 
Sweet 
16 
matchup, 

Michigan needed its offense firing 

on all cylinders. Early on, the offense 

fell flat, relying solely on junior 

forward Naz Hillmon.

Facing an aggressive Baylor 

defense, 
Brown 
had 
struggled 

throughout the first half to play a 

big offensive role. Typically the one-

two punch with Hillmon, Michigan 

needed Brown to step up in the 

second half to help turn the tide.

Coming out of halftime, Brown 

did just that. As the Bears continued 

to 
double 
down 
on 
Hillmon, 

Michigan needed someone else to 

produce on offense, as has been the 

case so many times this season. 

Brown started the second half 

with just four points. She ended 

the game with 23. Flaunting her 

signature mid-range jumper, Brown 

created space for herself on offense. 

“Obviously all of you guys see the 

offense that she brings to the floor,” 

Hillmon said. “When I’m drawing 

a lot of attention, her eyes light up … 

she takes over any chance that she 

has the opportunity to.”

Pushing the ball in transition, 

Brown racked up some transition 

points, alongside a clutch 3-pointer 

late in the second half. She also 

went 4-for-4 from the free-throw 

line, most of which came on driving 

layups in the lane.

Up until the end of the game, 

Baylor led the Wolverines, gaining 

a 12 point lead early in the first half. 

Throughout the second half, the 

Bears struggled to hold onto their 

lead as Brown continued to light up 

their defense. 

“You guys see how special she is,” 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 

said. “Such a dynamic 1-2 punch 

with her and Naz and so many 

teams just focus on Naz that it really 

opened things up for Leigha. She’s an 

incredible, incredible player. She’s a 

competitor.”

At the end of overtime, after a 

Baylor player stepped out of bounds 

with the ball, Michigan had one last 

chance to salvage the game. 

Cutting toward the inbounder, 

Brown received the pass a couple 

feet behind the 3-point arc. With 0.9 

seconds left on the clock, Brown only 

had time to turn and shoot over her 

defender. Chucking up a shot that 

narrowly missed the rim, Brown 

could only stand and watch as the ball 

landed on the court and time ran out. 

Brown might have carried the 

Wolverines through the second half, 

but when push came to shove, Brown 

just wasn’t enough.

After over seven months without a positive COVID-19 test, the Wolverines left Fargo without playing a single 
postseason game. 

The NCAA messed up. Michigan’s players are paying the price.

“It’s tough.” 
Those were the words of Michigan coach 

Kim Barnes Arico in her opening statement 
after the team’s loss to Baylor. 

The last shot in Michigan’s historic season 

was a missed 3-point attempt. 

Junior wing Leigha Brown had less than 

one second to get the shot off. Down by 
three in overtime against Baylor, the shot 
determined whether the Wolverines’ season 
ended or if the team would compete in double 
overtime. She missed.

Michigan’s loss was not caused by Brown’s 

missed shot, but rather the Wolverines’ poor 
3-point shooting throughout the earlier parts 
of the game. Their desire to knock down more 
long-range baskets than usual dug them into 
a hole that was tough from the team to climb 
out of. They left too many points on the board 
by shooting too many 3-pointers. 

Michigan is not a renowned 3-point 

shooting team, only shooting 30.1% from 
behind the arc. The identity of the team does 
not revolve around their accuracy from deep 
nor is it based upon the number of shots they 
take from behind the arc. 3-point shooting 
has always been a complementary part of the 
offense, but never the sole driver. 

In the loss against Baylor, however, 3-point 

shooting seemed to take precedence in Barnes 
Arico’s game plan. The team, which averages 17 
3-point attempts per game, shot 24 times from 
behind the arc, only making nine of those shots. 

The Wolverines started cold from the field. 

In the first half of the game, senior forward 
Hailey Brown went 1-for-5 from the 3-point 
range, and the team went 3-for-13. Poor 
shooting wasn’t because of a lack of open 
looks or even rushed attempts, the rapid ball 
movement that Michigan had showcased all 
year created many open opportunities for 
the team; it just couldn’t capitalize on those 
opportunities. 

In the second quarter, junior forward Naz 

Hillmon drew defenders into the post before 
bouncing the ball out to graduate guard 
Akienreh Johnson, who was cutting out to 
the baseline. Johnson, upon seeing Baylor 
defenders in the area, passed the ball quickly 
out to Leigha Brown who then dished it to a 
wide-open Hailey Brown who was waiting at 
the 3-point line. Brown missed the wide open 
shot. 

The entire passing sequence only lasted a 

few seconds but was long enough for Brown 
to get open and take what should have been 
an unpressured 3-point basket. A 35.2% 
3-point shooter on the year, Brown failed to 
close on the opportunity handed to her by her 
teammates, a pattern that was repeated in the 
first half of the game too frequently. 

The second half was when the Wolverines 

recovered their shooting skills. 

Going 6-for-11 in the second half, including 

overtime, Michigan saw multiple players 
knock down threes. Each long-range shot 
seemed to instill more confidence into the 
team as they fought back to compete with 
Baylor. 

Johnson sank a three to start off the second 

half, demonstrating that Barnes Arico’s 
team would not go down without a fight. 

Immediately on their next possession, junior 
guard Danielle Rauch also knocked down 
a three. Coming into the second half, and 
especially after Johnson’s and Rauch’s shots, 
the team was fired up and ready to go. 

“I’m complimenting Michigan because I 

haven’t seen them on film shoot the three ball 
like that all year. But it’s tournament time, it’s 
playoffs, it’s do or die,” said Baylor coach Kim 
Mulkey. “They had kids who barely averaged 
scoring and they were hitting threes. (They) 
almost doubled the number of threes they 
averaged all year.”

Despite the second half revival of the 

team, the Wolverines were not able to change 
their identity over the course of one game. By 
focusing on knocking down 3-point shots at 
the beginning, Michigan left plenty of points 
on the board and allowed Baylor, at one point, 
to build up a 12-point lead. 

While they were able to come back and 

bring the game to overtime, a leopard cannot 
easily change its spots.

Kim Barnes Arico was sitting at the 

podium with tears in her eyes. Her voice was 
cracking and she was explaining what drove 
her here, to Michigan. In this moment, at 
least, she could have 
said anything, and you 
would have believed it.

At that moment, 

though, 
she 
was 

talking about winning 
championships.

“When 
everybody 

comes to play at the 
University of Michigan, 
their goal is to win a 
championship,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Most teams at the University 
of Michigan have won a championship. But 
the fact that Michigan women’s basketball 
hasn’t is what drew me here, what made me 
leave my life of 40 years, because I believed 
in Michigan and I believed that we could 
create something special.

“But it doesn’t matter what I believe. We 

need players in our program that believe 
the same thing, players that could have gone 
anywhere else in the country and chose 
Michigan because they believe that they could 
come here and they could make a difference. 
They believed that they could come here and 
they could win a championship.”

After Saturday, you’d be wrong not to 

believe that, too. The Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s season ended less than an 
hour before Barnes Arico said that, but the 
way it ended ... Wow.

If you’re new to women’s basketball, let 

me explain something: Upsets don’t happen 
in women’s basketball. At least not anywhere 
near as often as on the men’s side. There’s a 
reason the same few programs — UConn, 
Baylor, South Carolina, Notre Dame — seem 
to win the championship every year. The gap 
between Michigan and Baylor, a 6-seed and 
a 2-seed, is supposed to be pretty big. The 
spread was 14 points in Saturday’s Sweet 16 
game. 

But then the unexpected happened: 

Michigan started hanging around. Junior 
wing Leigha Brown started hitting shots. 
Baylor took a 12-point lead and threw it 
away and all of a sudden people who hadn’t 
watched a minute of this team’s season were 
getting to their TVs. And then senior Hailey 
Brown was throwing an entry pass over the 
head of a defender and Naz Hillmon was 
tying the game and the Wolverines were on 
the verge of the kind of win that gets talked 
about around here for years and years and 
years.

“We had them on the ropes,” Barnes 

Arico said. “I actually thought we had them 
for a period of time there.”

Barnes Arico has put in the work here. 

This was her ninth season. It took six until 
the Wolverines were a consistent NCAA 
Tournament presence. She took the job 
knowing it would be a process, and built the 
program up slowly, steadily, working toward 
a day like Saturday. 

“You go back and look through the 

records of Michigan women’s basketball,” 
she said, but then redirected the thought. To 

finish it: The records of Michigan women’s 
basketball are, arguably, the ugliest of any 
program at the school.

So to have these Wolverines where they 

were this weekend, headed into overtime 
with the defending national champions, 
keeping pace in a game that hung on a knife’s 
edge, with Michigan’s two best players in foul 
trouble, in a one-point game with 15 seconds 
left. It’s hard to overstate what that means.

It’s also hard to get around what happened 

next. The Wolverines were unable to foul 
for another seven seconds. Graduate guard 
Akienreh Johnson lost control of her dribble 
off the inbound and hoisted a half-court 
shot with four seconds left to try and avoid 
traveling. Somehow, it nearly went in. 

Another heave with one second remaining 

fell short. Baylor came out alive, 78-75, and 
left Michigan feeling like a once-in-a-decade 
opportunity slipped through its fingers. 
That’s why Barnes Arico was sitting there 
with tears in her eyes, telling reporters 
about junior guard Danielle Rauch sitting 
in the locker room: “She said, ‘Man, I made 
a mistake here, man, I could have done this, 
man, what if I had done that, if I had that 
possession back.’ ”

Afterward, Barnes Arico said Baylor 

coach Kim Mulkey came up to her and 
complimented her team’s character.

“I never saw a team that played that hard, 

that played for each other, with fight, never 
quit,” Barnes Arico recalled her saying.

For a coach whose favorite cliche is that 

Michigan wants to be the “hardest working 
team in America,” that must have been one 
hell of a compliment. It’s also why Barnes 
Arico and the Wolverines will be able to 
get over this. It might feel like the sort of 
opportunity that may not come around 
again, but it will. This program is taking 
strides. If they could do this in 2020-21, 
when COVID-19 forced them into multiple 
shutdowns, when Leigha Brown missed 39 
days midseason, when center Izabel Varejão 
missed the entire season unable to get into 
the country until February, then you better 
believe they’ll be back.

“I don’t know if I’ve ever had a team 

like this,” Barnes Arico said. “I felt really 
good about ‘em. … You and everybody else 
out there that doubted us so many times, 
or we said disrespected us so many times, 
because we hadn’t played enough games or 
because we were shut down, on pause again, 
or because we had another student-athlete 
that was out with COVID. Pretty much we 
were thrown into every difficult situation all 
season long.

“If the rest of the country didn’t see that 

we’re one of the best basketball teams out 
there, I don’t know what you have to do to 
get that kind of respect.”

But all of that underscored something 

about this team, about this program. 
Something that you couldn’t say in the past 
— unless you were trying to speak it into 
existence. Something that’s now true.

“They’re winners,” Barnes Arico said. 

“They’re winners.”

Michigan forward Hailey Brown’s career 
ended in the Sweet Sixteen.

In observance of Women’s History Month, 

The Daily’s sports section is launching its fourth 
annual series aimed at telling the stories of female 
athletes, coaches and teams at the University 
from the perspective of the female sports writers 
on staff. Daily Sports Writer Abbie Telgenhof 
continues the series with this story.

Lexi Funk never wanted to coach.
In fact, she was vehemently opposed to it. 

But after COVID-19 derailed her senior season 
on the Michigan women’s gymnastics team, 
she knew she wasn’t done.

During her career at Michigan, Funk 

was a distinguished athlete. In 2019, she 
was named second-team All-American 
on beam. She helped lead the team to two 
national championship appearances in 
2017 and 2019 and three Big Ten team 
championships from 2017-19. But in 2020, 
like almost every other sport, gymnastics 
got shut down.

“I always said that I didn’t want to coach 

when I was in college and people asked me what 
I wanted to do afterwards,” Funk said. “... But 
with everything that happened with COVID, 
ending our season a little bit too early, missing 
out on championships and stuff in the 2020 
season, I kind of just felt like I wasn’t done with 
the sport.”

Because of COVID-19, Funk no longer had 

a solid plan for what she wanted to do after 

school. So she turned to what she’d always 
known: gymnastics.

“I reached out to (Michigan coach) Bev 

(Plocki) and asked if there was any way that I 
could come and kind of stay part of the team 
and help coach,” Funk said. “And she was really 
willing to help me figure that out.”

Plocki offered her a volunteer assistant 

coaching position, and Funk immediately 
took it. Originally, Funk was nervous about 
the transition from athlete to coach. After all, 
she’d be coaching athletes she’d once been 
teammates with. But shortly after she started, 
she learned she had nothing to worry about.

“It’s a lot of fun, I’m still able to joke around 

with them and have fun, but they’ve really 
respected the new role that I’ve taken on,” she 
said. “And I made it clear from the beginning 
that I needed their help to transition into the 
coaching role rather than the fellow teammate 
role. And everyone has been on board with 
that. So it’s been pretty smooth actually.”

Her former teammates are always ready 

to hear her advice, something she says helped 
with the transition. Funk was also a team 
captain her senior year, so the shift in leadership 
role was a natural transition.

“Absolutely, I think a lot about being a captain 

is taking that leadership role and being in front 
of the team, and getting everyone going, and 
keeping the energy up, and being the liaison 
between communicating between what the 
athletes are thinking and saying and what the 
coaches want and are saying,” Funk said. “So I 
think that definitely helped in the transition as 

well, because the girls had already seen me in 
a leadership role. So it wasn’t like some new big 
role that I was taking on as a coach.”

Funk is loving the new, expanded role she 

gets to play in the program. Being a coach has 
given her a different perspective, one in which 
she is better able to appreciate all the hard work 
her former teammates put in.

“I think it’s really fun to get to see all the hard 

work that everyone is putting in the gym day 
in and day out,” she said. “I think as an athlete 
you’re always rooting for your teammates, and 
you’re always cheering for them and stuff.”

Michigan’s Lexi Funk is transitioning into coaching after 

her senior season was cut short due to COVID-19.

In observance of Women’s History Month, 

The Daily’s sports section is launching its fourth 
annual series aimed at telling the stories of female 
athletes, coaches and teams at the University 
from the perspective of the female sports writers 
on staff. Daily Sports Writer Lily Israel continues 
the series with this story.

Naz Hillmon sat in the back of her mom’s car 

on the way home from her first AAU basketball 
tournament as a middle schooler. She asked a 
simple question. 

“Mom, are you an All-American?” Her 

Mom replied yes. A few minutes went by. 
Then, another question. “Mom, what’s an All-
American?”

Most children with a parent of NaSheema 

Anderson’s pedigree wouldn’t have to ask a 
question like this. But that’s just how Anderson 
wanted to raise her daughter. Anderson played 
college basketball at Vanderbilt from 1994-98, 
where she earned All-American honors and 
became a staple in the college basketball world 
and continued playing professionally in the 
American Basketball League for one season. 

Fast forward to present day, the junior star 

forward not only knows what an All-American 
is, but is one herself, becoming the first 
Michigan women’s basketball player to ever 
receive the honor. 

The basketball roots in Hillmon’s family 

extend far beyond her mom. Including herself, 
her extended family has won seven Ohio 
basketball high school state championships 
and racked up many other awards. There are 
countless uncles, aunts and grandparents 
Hillmon could have leaned on to learn the 
game from. But it is Hillmon’s relationship with 
her mom that stands out.

From an early age, Anderson wanted 

Hillmon to find her own path and be her own 
person. Though Anderson jokes that Hillmon 
and her two brothers have been dribbling 
basketballs since before they were born, no one 
pressured Hillmon into playing basketball. Her 
mom wanted her to grow into the sport herself, 
no matter how much restraint Anderson had to 
show. 

“A lot of it was my husband and I had to have 

him to back me up. He said, ‘You’re overbearing, 
you’re aggressive. She’s not you,’ ” Anderson 
said. “He’s like, ‘she doesn’t understand the X’s 
and O’s that you’re saying. But I’m telling him I 
believe she does. Her IQ is very high. Like, you 
know, I can see things in her. But at the same 
time, she just more or less wanted to be with 
her friends.”

Hillmon played basketball from an early 

age. One year in middle school, her team 
didn’t have a coach. Her mom desperately 
wanted her to be able to play, so she decided to 
coach the team herself. Anderson’s coaching 
career came to an end after one season when 

she realized it wasn’t such a smart idea to 
coach her daughter along with a handful of 
other kids just learning to play the game. 

Hillmon has been consistent in her pursuit of 

basketball, except for one small moment when 
she was in middle school. In seventh grade, 
Hillmon’s desire to play basketball hit what 
Anderson calls “a brick wall.” Instead, Hillmon 
wanted to run track and play volleyball.

“That’s probably one of the only times where 

I had a complete meltdown,” Anderson said. “I 
could not get myself together. For the first time 
I saw this person that could articulate why they 
didn’t want to do something.”

Hillmon could articulate those feelings 

because of the lessons her mom had instilled 
within her from a young age. This is when 
Anderson learned how to better balance her 
role as mom and coach. Anderson’s husband 
and Hillmon’s dad Victor kept her in check 
from being too overbearing or too aggressive. 
Anderson lived and breathed basketball, but, 
at that point, her daughter didn’t. Hillmon’s 
physical attributes were always there, but it 
took some time for her mom’s fiery passion to 
catch up to her. 

“The mom-coach role was difficult, to say the 

least, because I lived, slept and ate basketball and 
of course she didn’t,” Anderson said. 

Basketball has, without a doubt, bonded the 

two women together. Hillmon and Anderson 
share many similarities — namely their love 
for basketball — but these similarities manifest 

themselves in very different ways. 

“She’s like a mini me, but with a nicer 

version,” Anderson said. “Naz is one of the 
sweetest, kindest people that you’ll ever meet, 
and it’s genuine. Other people say, ‘Naz gets to 
be nice and not aggressive because her mom is 
not nice and aggressive.’ For me to have a child 
that’s totally opposite of me is hilarious. Even 
though people say we look alike and we sound 
alike, we definitely don’t act alike.”

Anderson believes her daughter became the 

humble player she is because of the way she 
grew up. Hillmon has always been the person 
who brings other people together. She prefers 
to settle arguments within her family by 
leaning on faith instead of fighting and fussing. 
She always brings people together with love. 

From an early age, Anderson learned 

that her daughter was very communicative, 
responding better to nonverbal cues than 
vocal aggression. Out of this was born the 
pair’s 24-hour rule. For a full 24 hours after 
every game, the mother-daughter duo don’t 
talk basketball with each other. Win or lose, 
Anderson texts her daughter asking more 
personal things like how she feels, what she ate 
before the game and how she slept. This one 
day of space gives both the time they need to 
process the game.

For Hillmon, it gives her time to decompress 

from the game. For Anderson, it gives her time 
to cool off and not become a coaching figure 
when she strives to be a mom. 

“It works for us because I always want her 

to know I’m her mom first, and basketball (is) 
secondary,” Anderson said. “If she never picked 
up a ball again the love that we have for each 
other would be the same.”

As much as the two have a mother-daughter 

relationship, they see each other as equals and 
are best friends. Hillmon acts as a conscience 
for her mom. Anderson can always hear 
her daughter’s voice in the back of her head 
imploring her to be nice and say something 
nice. Hillmon also gives her mom a taste of 
her own medicine, telling her things about 
taking the higher road just as Anderson taught 
Hillmon when she was younger. 

“Sometimes I have to remember that she’s 

20 because my instinct, both of our instincts, 
are always to call one another when something 
good or bad happens,” Anderson said. “She’s 
the first person that I think about to call or the 
last person that I think to text when I go to bed.”

The relationship built on love and mutual 

trust inherently has a competitive element to it. 
The two spent the first part of their quarantine 
together rewatching countless amounts of old 
film, including some from Anderson’s career. 

When Anderson watches Hillmon play, she 

is always the loudest one at the game, taking 
it upon herself to argue with the refs from the 
stands so her daughter doesn’t have to.

Just like that, the dream ended. 

Two hours earlier, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team hoped to be 

cutting down the nets en route to 

their second Final Four appearance 

in four years. Unfortunately for the 

Wolverines, UCLA had other ideas. 

Now, in the wee hours of Wednesday 

morning, a dichotomous visual took 

shape on the court at Lucas Oil Stadium. 

On one side, a dejected Michigan team 

shuffled off the floor and into the 

offseason. On the other, the 11-seeded 

Bruins celebrated the continuation of 

an unlikely run from a play-in game to 

the first weekend of April. 

While the Wolverines, as the Big 

Ten regular-season champions and 

the East region’s No. 1 seed, held lofty 

expectations heading into the Big 

Dance, falling one game short of the 

Final Four is not a failure by any means. 

Instead, it serves as the punctuation 

mark on a successful season for second-

year coach Juwan Howard. 

Coming into the season, Michigan 

was picked to finish as low as ninth in 

the Big Ten by some media outlets. The 

Wolverines blew these expectations 

out of the water. The return of key 

contributors 
like 

senior Isaiah Livers 

and sophomore Franz 

Wagner on the wings 

and 
senior 
guard 

Eli Brooks, coupled 

with the infusion of 

talented 
newcomers 

who 
joined 
the 

program as transfers 

and 
freshmen, 

propelled 
Michigan 

to a dominant regular 

season. As of March 1, 

the Wolverines trailed 

only 
undefeated 

Gonzaga in the AP top-25 poll. 

“I was excited to see that we were 

seeded number one because it proved 

that this team of players and staff have 

worked so hard to get to this point right 

here,” Howard said when the bracket 

was revealed on March 14. “It’s been 

a very long journey, at times it’s been 

stressful but the highs are outweighing 

the lows. Our guys have worked so hard, 

so they deserve to be in this position so 

I’m so proud of them.”

Under Howard’s tutelage, freshman 

center Hunter Dickinson burst onto the 

scene and earned Big Ten Freshman of 

the Year honors. Dickinson claimed the 

starting center position from fifth-year 

senior Austin Davis five games into the 

season and never looked back. Barring 

the 
unforeseen, 
Dickinson 
should 

return for his sophomore campaign — a 

scary proposition for the rest of the Big 

Ten. 

“For a player like me, I think it’s an 

understatement to say I’ve enjoyed this 

season,” Dickinson said on March 17. “I 

really think this season has been special 

for me because I’ve met my teammates 

and I love hanging out with them. … I 

try to do my best to just help out as 

much as possible because that’s kinda 

my love for them, I wanna do my part 

and help them win as much as I want to 

win.”

The post-Zavier Simpson era at the 

point guard position also began without 

a hitch. Columbia transfer Mike Smith 

filled the void left by Simpson with 

aplomb, averaging 10 points per game, 

shooting 42% from 3-point range and 

leading the Big Ten in assists. 

Thanks to the family-like culture 

Howard has worked so hard to instill 

in his short tenure, Dickinson, Smith 

and sixth-man spark plug Chaundee 

Brown Jr. — a transfer from Wake 

Forest — assimilated immediately. 

Michigan’s success reflected genuine 

chemistry. Throughout the season, it 

was demonstrated by the Wolverines’ 

bench cheering on their teammates and 

expressed in every media availability. 

“Almost every team now or every 

organization will say to you, culture 

and values and family and all this 

other stuff,” associate head coach Phil 

Martelli told reporters in November. 

“And being perfectly frank, I think 

sometimes it’s bullshit. They’re the 

catchphrases so I’m supposed to say it. 

“But to Juwan’s 

credit, he does live 

by those cultural 

beliefs. He really 

does see everybody 

involved 
in 
the 

program as family 

and he understands 

that in families you 

treat 
each 
other 

fairly but you do 

have to treat each 

other a little bit 

differently.”

The 
positivity 

surrounding 
this 

program is palpable from the outside. 

Even 
after 
early-season 
struggles 

against Oakland, losses to Illinois and 

Michigan State at the end of the season, 

and dramatically bowing out of the Big 

Ten Tournament in the semifinals, the 

Wolverines never seemed like a divided 

bunch.

To lose on the precipice of the Final 

Four is undeniably disappointing, but 

that, in-and-of-itself signifies that the 

Wolverines are in good hands. When 

Howard took over for John Beilein 

in May of 2019, few expected the 

transition to be this smooth. Howard’s 

taken an already strong foundation and 

added his own touches to it. 

“I never forget going back to my press 

conference,” Howard said on March 

14. “When I said I have unfinished 

business, (a title) is the unfinished 

business.” 

Howard’s business may still be 

unfinished, but if the Wolverines’ 2020-

21 season is a sign of things to come, it 

won’t be for very long. 

“They could say it’s me being me, but 

I really do believe that he’s a can’t-miss,” 

Martelli said. “He will coach a national 

champion before he leaves Michigan.”
