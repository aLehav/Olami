STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Central 
Student 

Government 
released 
its 

2018 
internal 
demographic 

report Monday, with 52 of 68 
representatives responding to 
the survey. The report showed 
increased representation of 
minority students from last 
year.

CSG 
representative 
Efe 

Edevbie, a Kinesiology junior, 
said the survey aims to depict 
students representation within 
the student government. 

According to the report, 

61.54 percent of CSG is between 
the ages of 20 and 21. Over 38 
percent of CSG members are 
seniors, while 20.6 percent of 
total University of Michigan 
students are seniors.

In terms of sex, CSG was 

52 percent female and 48 
percent 
male, 
while 
the 

undergraduate student body is 
about 49 percent female and 51 
percent male. No respondents 
identified as transgender. Last 

year’s survey reported CSG 
was 58.1 percent male, 40.7 
percent female and 1.2 percent 
genderqueer.

The report also states 57.69 

percent of CSG representatives 
identify as white, 11.54 percent 
Black, 19.23 percent Asian, 5.77 
percent Middle Eastern and 
North African, 3.85 percent 
Latino, and 1.92 percent mixed 
race. No respondents identified 
as Native American. In last 
year’s report, 69.8 percent of 
CSG representatives identified 
as white, 7 percent Black, 9.3 
percent Asian, 8.1 percent 
mixed race and 0 percent 
Latino. MENAstudents were 
classified as “Other,” which 
constituted 4.7 percent. 

The 
general 
increase 

in 
diversity 
of 
elected 

representatives, Edevbie said, 
started with running more 
diverse candidates.

“Our candidates for last 

year were very diverse and 
really touched on a lot of 
parts on campus, both on a 
racial aspect and just overall

Between 400 and 600 attended the student-organized awareness rally in Ypsilanti

Amid cheers and shouts, 

Washtenaw International High 
School sophomore Elizabeth 
Blackwell 
delivered 
her 

spoken-word poem at a student-
organized gun control rally 
in Ypsilanti Wednesday. Her 
piece was written a day after 
the Parkland, Fla. shooting, 
titled “An Open Letter to my 
Congressman.”

“So don’t you dare exchange 

our learning for your lobbyists, 
our 
safety 
for 
your 
semi-

automatics, our dreams for 
donations,” 
Blackwell 
said. 

“Because pissed off teenagers 
that are so alive, and so in love 
in with living, will not let you 
to reduce us to thoughts and 
prayers –– to another statistic. 
Because we will be the tsunami 
that carries you out of office for 
good.” 

The rally was organized by 

Washtenaw Youth Initiative, 
an 
organization 
consisting 

primarily 
of 
high 
school 

students 
that 
formed 
in 

reaction to the Feb. 14 shooting 
at Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High which left 17 dead. The 
Initiative’s platform consists of 
five main points: banning guns 
in schools, raising the legal 
age of purchase to 21, implicit 
bias training and psychological 
certification of police officers 
carrying guns, requiring a gun 
safety class before purchase 
and banning the sale of assault 
weapons.

Pioneer High School senior 

and Student Council President 

Emma Roth was one of the 
main organizers of the event 
and collaborated with students 
from other high schools such 
as Skyline, Lincoln and South 
Lyon. The students organized 
through social media to garner 
more support. Roth estimated 
the final turnout to be between 
400 and 600 people.

they’re 
not 
alone.

ELIZABETH LAWRENCE

Daily News Reporter

At the start of last year, 

the 
Kessler 
Presidential 

Scholars Program launched 
its two-year pilot expansion 
initiative 
with 
the 
hope 

of serving its recipients in 
a 
more 
holistic 
manner. 

The 
program 
is 
targeted 

toward individuals who have 
financial need, are among 
the first in their families to 
attend college, demonstrate 
leadership aptitude and have 
an 
interest 
in 
community 

service. The pilot is now 
halfway completed, and aims 
to continue developing its 
resources for students.

The expansion emphasized 

five main areas: intentional 
cohort 
recruitment, 

substantial financial support, 
unique 
programming 
and 

resources, 
community-

building 
through 
alumni 

outreach 
and 
systematic 

evaluation.

Program 
Director 
Gail 

Gibson 
explained 
the 

expansion 
was 
established 

to better meet the mission of 
ensuring students’ ability to 
thrive socially, academically 
and emotionally on campus.

“We’re 
really 
thinking 

through how we can extend 
our reach and help students 
thrive 
while 
they’re 
at 

Michigan, as well as when 
they leave here and go on to 
whatever comes next and 

what that looks like with 
scholarship support but also 
with wrap-around resources 
to fill in other kinds of gaps,” 
Gibson said.

Gibson further explained 

how of the many changes the 
program hopes to develop; 
the prioritization of first-
generation 
students 
— 

through 
intentional 
cohort 

recruitment — is one of the 
most important factors.

“One of the first changes, 

was 
to 
prioritize 
first-

generation students, which 
we define as students whose 
parents attended some college 
but who don’t have a four-
year 
bachelor’s 
degree,” 

Gibson 
said. 
“That 
focus 

on 
first-generation 
student 

distinguishes 
the 
program 

among scholarship programs 
at Michigan.”

Gibson 
also 
said 
the 

program 
was 
taking 

actionable steps to meet the 

goal by carefully selecting 
applicants based on their need 
and 
leadership 
inclination. 

According 
to 
the 
Kessler 

Presidential 
Scholars 
2017 

Annual Report, all scholars 
in the 2017 cohort were first-
generation. 

“We 
are 
doing 
really 

intentional 
recruitment 

of 
who 
comes 
into 
the 

scholarship program, which 
means 
going 
back 
after 

students are admitted to read 
The University of Michigan 

chapter of College Republicans 
hosted a panel titled “Women in 
Politics” Wednesday evening in 
the Michigan League to showcase 
strong conservative female leaders 
in the Republican Party. 

Four panelists spoke at the event: 

Linda Lee Tarver, president of the 
Republican 
Women 
Federation 

of 
Michigan; 
Andrea 
Fischer 

Newman, a University regent and 
former Delta Airlines lobbyist; 
Congressional 
candidate 
Lena 

Epstein; and campaign strategy 
consultant Dawn Dodge. 

Tarver monitored the event and 

began by stating only 1 percent 
of Americans fully participate in 
politics, which she attributes to 
the respectable level of the self-
confidence needed.

“While we have a lot of political 

activists in this room, only 1 percent 
participate in politics,” Tarver said. 
“It takes quite a bit of (intestinal 
feeling) and girth in order to get 
out and put your name out there 
and your face out there and voice 
what you truly believe in. It is not 
to be disrespected. It is not to be put

Wednesday 
evening, 
the 

Michigan State Senate approved 
bipartisan legislation to provide 
more resources and support 
to survivors of sexual assault 
and harassment with a vote 
of 28-7. The bills will now 
go to the Michigan House of 
Representatives.

Led by the victims of Larry 

Nassar, disgraced former U.S.A. 
Gymnastics 
and 
Michigan 

State 
University 
doctor, 
the 

legislation came in a package of 
bills that works to change how 
universities and state institutions 
respond 
to 
sexual 
assault 

reports. Under the legislation, 
penalties for possessing child 
pornography are increased to 
four years. The individuals 
legally required to report sexual 
abuse complaints also increased 
to 
include 
coaches, 
athletic 

trainers, 
physical 
therapists 

with a penalty of $1,000 for not 
reporting. In addition, the law 
clarifies 
government 
entities, 

universities and colleges do not 
have immunity from cases of 
sexual assault.

down.”

She also detailed how the GOP 

gave her family a chance at a 
different life. Tarver spoke about 
her family’s move to Michigan 
after a relative was lynched in 

Alabama. She said she believes this 
move helped her mother get an 
opportunity to become involved in 
politics.

“When my mother came to 

Michigan, she could vote in 1918. 
She could vote here since 1918. She 
could vote in Michigan since 1918 
thanks to Republican women,” 
Tarver said. 

Newman 
addressed 
sexual 

assault in the United States, 
specifically 
the 
#MeToo 

movement. Newman called for 
stronger adherence to misconduct 
policies

“I for one, am happy about the 

#MeToo movement,” Newman 
said. “I think it is about time and 
was glad to see it happen … We 

have policies and I think they 
need to be implemented.”

Epstein 
addressed 
her 

desire to become involved 
in politics when she began 
noticing legislators voting for 
issues of which they weren’t 
fully knowledgeable.

“I am ready to serve 

Michigan’s 11th district at 
a time where conservative 
values 
are 
needed 
more 

than ever,” Epstein. “When 
we talk about the swamp 
in Washington, D.C. – that 
swamp is real. We have 
legislators who are voting on 
things in which they know 
nothing. We have legislators 
introducing legislation and 
voting on legislation they have 
never read.”

Berden 
addressed 
what 

she sees as a societal issue 
regarding child development 
and responsibility.

“It concerns me to see 

someone 
of 
a 
younger 

generation 
not 
knowing 

how to dust furniture or do 
anything (on their own),” 
Berden said. “It seems to be a 
laxer in the way we are raising 

children today. The early years 
formation are so important.”

Tarver 
made 
an 
analogy 

comparing 
how 
Republicans 

identify with their platform and 
how religious groups identify with 
religious texts.

“If you are a subscriber to the 

Bible, you identify as a Christian,” 
Tarver said. “If you are a believer 
in the Quran, you are considered 
a Muslim. If you are a believer in 
the Torah, you are Jewish. These 
writings are sacred for (people 
that adopt them), believe in and 
hold dear are how we identify 
ourselves...what joins us all in 
identifying who we are is written 
in our Republican platform.”

Epstein 
reflected 
on 
the 

Republican 
platform 
and 
its 

relation to the U.S. Constitution.

“The 
Republican 
platform 

brings us back to the ideals of 
our founding fathers and what 
the Constitution was intended to 
achieve in this country,” Epstein 
said.

College 
Republicans 
Vice 

President Amanda Delekta, an LSA 
junior, felt the event was important 
in displaying how the party regards 
female representation in politics. 

“In the current political moment, 

we’ve seen how women have had 
a lot of hardships in gaining full 
inclusion in the American political 
sphere,” Delekta said. “We wanted 
to explore how those issues are 
being explored in the Republican 
Party and I think often times it’s 
explored through the Democratic 
Party.”

The University of Michigan 

has announced several plans to 
renovate the Michigan Union, 
including the elimination of the 
Billiards Room. In a recent post 
on eBay, the University’s Property 
Disposition 
department 
listed 

several Billiards Room items for 
auction.

The items include three vintage 

pool tables, with prices ranging 
from $840 to $3,650, and a stained-
glass pool table light for $1,676.

Susan Pile, senior director of 

University Unions and Auxiliary 

Services, said the auction for the 
pool tables will end Wednesday 
and the auction for the light will 
end 
Thursday. 
However, 
she 

expects the University will sell 
more items from the room in the 
near future.

“We anticipate a few more 

lights and tables will be made 
available in the coming months as 
we determine plans for the items,” 
Pile wrote in a statement for the 
Detroit Free Press. 

Proceeds from the auctions will 

go toward the Michigan Union 
student leadership scholarship.

The 
board’s 
decision 
to 

eliminate the Billiards Room has 
generated some criticism in the 

past months from students and 
alumni.

University alum Alan Knaus, 

a member of Friends of the 
Michigan Union, expressed his 
disappointment 
the 
Billiards 

Room would not be preserved in 
the remodeled Union. According 
to 
Knaus, 
the 
renovations 

favor students over alumni by 
eliminating historic elements such 
as the Billiards Room.

“I was not happy with (the 

elimination of the Billiards Room) 
and the alumni that were there 
were also not very happy about 
that,” Knaus said last March.

In a Statement article for The 

Daily, contributor Will Feuer, a 

Public Policy junior, explained 
the significance of the Billiards 
Room in his college life. Feuer, 
a member of the University’s 
Billiards Club declared students 
and communities on campus are 
devastated by the University’s 
decision to eliminate the Billiards 
Room.

“Though 
far 
and 
few 
in 

between, there is a network 
of individuals on campus who 
don’t just love billiards but love 
the billiards hall,” Feuer wrote. 
“That’s why I question the Union 
renovations slated to begin this 
April, which will not only erase the 
pool hall entirely but also devastate 
the community surrounding it.”

demographic 
standpoint,” 

Edevbie said. “I think that’s 
definitely a reflection of some 
more marginalized groups on 
campus having more and more 
seats at the table when it comes 
to CSG assembly.”

The 
overall 
University 

student body is 54.58 percent 
white, 11.99 percent Asian, 5.65 
percent Latino, 4.2 percent 
Black, 
1.89 
percent 
mixed 

race and 0.18 percent Native 
American. The University does 
not currently have statistics on 
MENA students.

Michigan 
residents 
make 

up 
63.46 
percent 
of 
CSG 

representatives, compared to 
50.69 percent University-wide. 
According to the report, 24 
percent of CSG representatives 
come from a household income 
of $99,999 or less and 76 percent 
come from household incomes 
of $100,000 or more. Over 
half of CSG representatives, 

54.9 percent, report not being 
financial 
aid 
recipients. 

Last year, 65% percent of 
represenatives 
reported 
not 

being financial aid recipients.

CSG representative Frank 

Guzman, an LSA sophomore, 
acknowledged CSG still has 
more 
work 
to 
do 
toward 

inclusion and representation, 
but he feels it is making 
progress.

“We’re 
not 
a 
perfect 

institution,” 
Guzman 
said. 

“I think that we’re making 
progress 
towards 
becoming 

more 
representative. 
Part 

of 
being 
representative 
is 

representing 
that 
median 

income. I know it’s not ideal, 
but we’re working on it.”

A 
2017 
report 
by 
the 

Equality 
of 
Opportunity 

Project stated the University’s 
median household income was 
$154,000 and 9.3 percent of 
students coming from the top 1 
percent income bracket. 

through application material 
to see who has the inclination 
and 
capacity 
for 
serving 

communities because our goal 
is to create a community of 
students 
that 
supports 
one 

another while they’re here but 
are committed to giving back in 
their own lives and careers on 
the outside,” Gibson said.

The program offered its first 

awards in 2008 and since has 
grown to become one of the 
largest 
scholarship 
program 

in LSA. Today, the University 
supports 172 Kessler scholars 
and welcomes 35 individuals 
into the program annually.

LSA senior Ashley Olney 

expressed her appreciation for 
the program as a Kessler scholar 
and its efforts to help students 
through its scholarships and 
resource

“I’m overall very appreciative 

because it is a need-based and 
a merit-based scholarship, so 
I wouldn’t be able to attend 
the University of Michigan 
without it, and it’s also a great 
community,” Olney said. “So not 
only are they helping students 
financially to get to school, 
they’re helping to integrate us 
into such a large university.”

Gibson emphasized Olney’s 

statement and described the 
program’s continued dedication 
to providing sufficient financial 
support along with additional 
resources.

“It’s 
money 
that 
makes 

coming to Michigan possible, 
but again it’s not money alone,” 
Gibson said. “It’s paired with 
wrap-around support, whether 
it’s one-on-one counseling with 

staff or whether it’s a workshop 
about getting ready for the 
professional job search.”

Olney 
also 
noted 
the 

program’s 
expansion 
efforts 

seeking to establish a stronger 
community among the scholars.

“I think they’re really trying 

to create more of a community 
within the Kessler Scholars 
Program,” 
Olney 
said. 
“My 

entire 
four 
years 
they’ve 

offered a couple of social and 
academic events each month, 
but they wanted to foster with a 
greater and tighter community 
because we are a pretty small 
scholarship 
group 
here 
on 

campus.”

Additionally, 
Olney 
said 

she — along with other Kessler 
scholars — were invited to 
participate in focus groups 
over the summer. During the 
sessions, students were asked 
what resources they would have 
liked to have upon entering 
the University. Olney praised 
the program for taking the 
initiative to better understand 
the needs of students.

“I think they were really 

proactive 
in 
creating 
focus 

groups and asking students 
specifically what they would 
want if they had the chance to 
come in as a Kessler scholar all 
over again, or what they would 
like moving forward if they 
had a couple more years here,” 
Olney said.

One of the programs that 

developed as a result of the focus 
group was a peer mentorship 
program. Kessler scholars are 
paired with an older student in 
the program and are instructed 
to 
meet 
biweekly 
to 
offer 

support to one another. Olney 
discussed her excitement for 
the new initiative and how it 
offered a way to make a campus 
as large as the University’s seem 
a lot smaller.

“It was something that I 

wish I had coming in because 
I went to a really small high 
school and transitioning into 

life at U of M, where there were 
more people in my dorm than 
in my entire town, was very 
difficult, academically it was 
very difficult and socially it was 
very difficult,” Olney said. “I 
wish I had someone who would 
check in on me who was in the 
same position that I was. Even 
now, even though I am not being 
mentored, I am a mentor, it’s 
something that makes me really 
appreciative 
of 
the 
Kessler 

Scholarship.”\

Kessler 
scholar 
Michelle 

Figueroa, an LSA freshman, 
shared Olney sentiments and 
explained 
how 
her 
mentor 

helps her to better prepare 
for the University’s academic 
endeavors.

“My mentor is amazing, and 

she takes similar classes to mine 
and we have similar majors,” 
Figueroa said. “So she kind 
of walks me through how to 
prepare for my classes because 
she’s took them already, so 
that’s been really helpful.”

One of the other ways the 

program is seeking to develop a 
community while also offering 
students 
more 
resources 
is 

through various workshops and 
seminars that are mandatory 
for first-year students to attend. 
Most recently, it hosted one 
about finances and budgeting 
and 
featured 
Detroit-based 

financial planner Gail Perry-
Mason. Additionally, they have 
stress-management 
services 

and “Walk-In Wednesday,” a 
weekly time for students to 
speak to administrators, among 
other resources to help students 

with their mental health.

Kessler 
scholar 
Donnell 

Williams, an LSA freshman, 
expressed his appreciation for 
the stress-management services 
in particular, because adjusting 
to the University setting can be 
overwhelming.

“The 
stress-management 

ones are helpful,” Williams said, 
“College can be pretty stressful, 
especially when you’re a first 
year and you’re just adapting to 
the environment that you’re in, 
it helps a lot.”

Though many of the Kessler 

scholars have been pleased 
with the results of the first-
year 
expansions, 
Gibson 

acknowledges the program still 
has room to grow — especially 
with 
regard 
to 
connecting 

students 
with 
campus 

resources.

“One thing we know we 

could do better is how we 
connect students with existing 
resources,” Gibson said. “At a 
big school like Michigan, that’s 
a constant puzzle, but we’ve 
built interesting partnerships 
with 
the 
Science 
Learning 

Center, we’re working really 
closely with the opportunity 
hub, we’re getting students into 
the places that can give them 
the best support.”

Olney also touched on the 

issue 
of 
accessibility 
and 

explained how even though 
she was impressed with all the 
events hosted by the program, 
the timing often conflicted with 
her class schedule.

“I’m a screen arts and culture 

major and because of that I 

have 
screenings 
throughout 

the week in the evening,” Olney 
said. “Although Kessler scholars 
have a lot of really great social, 
academic 
and 
networking 

events, they’re all held Mondays 
… when I have class, so I’m 
not able to go to any of them 
so I can’t access all the great 
resources that they’re providing 
for their students.”

In the future, the Kessler 

Presidential Scholars Program 
seeks 
to 
continue 
growing 

through its new partnership 
with 
the 
Comprehensive 

Studies 
Program. 
Beginning 

next fall, the incoming cohort 
will take a one credit seminar 
together to explore how to make 
the most of the University.

Gibson said she hoped the 

commonality 
of 
the 
course 

among the new members will 
help to establish a sense of 
community.

“Our 
goal 
is 
creating 

community, and we think that 
one way to enhance that from the 
start to build this extra layer of 
support is to allow them to have 
some sort of shared educational 
experience,” Gibson said.

As for Figueroa, she hoped to 

continue to share more about 
the program and its mission 
with the rest of the University 
community moving forward.

“A lot of people don’t know 

what 
Kessler 
scholars 
are, 

and (I wish to) show people 
what we really do.” Figueroa 
said. “It’s not just a support 
system financially, it’s also a 
support system emotionally and 
academically.”

gun

legislation. 

Teenagers gathered at notable 
locations across the country: 
the U.S. Capitol in Washington, 
D.C.; the site of the 1999 school 
shooting in Columbine, Colo.; 
Borough Hall in Brooklyn, 
N.Y.; and more. These protests 
follow impassioned speeches 
and rallies hosted by student 
survivors 
of 
the 
Parkland 

shooting, who have become 
nationally recognized.

The 
Ypsilanti 
rally 
also 

featured an array of different 
speakers, from high school 
students 
to 
representatives 

from Moms Demand Action. 

Skyline senior Daniel Heinz 

said he participated in the 
walkout because he felt the 
need for action.

“I came today because we 

need to do something about 
this,” Heinz said. “I couldn’t 
just sit around and do nothing. 
We just demand change. We 
call B.S. There needs to be a 
conversation.”

Heinz further explained his 

involvement in the movement 
through 
his 
concern 
for 

himself and his peers, saying 
he’s had enough.

“I care about everyone who 

lives in my country, I care about 
my people,” Heinz said. “I’m 
tired of seeing kids’ names on 
the screen. I’m tired of seeing 
all these dead children.”

Pioneer sophomore Maya 

Boyd attended because she 
feels she can make a difference. 
Young people, even without 
the ability to vote, can still 
affect change, she said.

“I am a student who wants to 

make a change with my voice 
and platform,” Boyd said. “I 
realize that we have a voice, 
not just our parents. We can 
educate people and make a 
difference.”

The rally saw a lot of adult 

attendance 
as 
well. 
Ann 

Arbor resident Lisa Querijero, 
a mother of two, said she 
decided to attend after high 
schoolers 
from 
the 
area 

spoke at an Ann Arbor Open 
Coordinating Council meeting. 
She described her sadness that 
her children have to perform 
active shooter drills in school 
and learn about gun violence 
at such young ages. Just like 
Heinz and Boyd, she wanted to 
make change.

“I want to change the fear 

that I can hear from these 
kids,” Querijero said. “That 
they feel in school. I had no 
idea that they were so fearful 
before I came here today.”

According to Roth, school 

administrators share this fear 
but are not legally allowed 
to endorse the rally. She said 
different schools had a variety 
of reactions.

“Unofficially, 

administration and teachers 
are 
scared,” 
Roth 
said. 

“They all feel it’s incredibly 
important. However, legally 
they cannot support anything 

we rally. Some of them sort of 
supported the walkout. But I 
know one school did actually 
threaten to block off roads so 

the kids couldn’t come to this. 
Another 
school 
threatened 

harsher suspensions. But in 
general admin are scared, so 
they get it.”

Roth said she would love 

to 
collaborate 
with 
other 

students 
across 
Michigan 

and the country. Washtenaw 
Youth Initiative is planning 
to go to Washington, D.C. for 
a national gun safety march, 
where Roth hopes they can 
meet more students. She also 
mentioned her determination 
to continue her activist work at 
Boston University, where she 
plans to study public health 
and theater.

The New Yorker pointed 

out how many of the Parkland 
student 
activists 
are 
also 

involved 
in 
theater. 
Roth 

suggested 
this 
correlation 

exists because of theater’s place 
as a haven for nonconformists 
and those who want to make 
change.

“Theater for a long time 

historically has been about 
sort of discussing things the 
public doesn’t normally want 
to discuss,” Roth said. “Theater 
is generally a place for students 
who don’t necessarily feel like 
they just want to conform. 
Whether that’s based on gender 
identity, sexual identity, racial 
and ethnic identities. But I 
think that sort of atmosphere 
does cultivate students who 
are interested in changing 
society.”

To create this change, Heinz 

urged everyone who has the 
ability to register to vote.

“If you are old enough to 

vote, register to vote,” he said. 
“Period. I don’t care which side 
you’re on, just vote, vote, vote.”

WALKOUT
From Page 1

Additionally, legislation would 

change the statute of limitations 
on reporting sexual assault. 
Under previous Michigan law, 
survivors 
who 
were 
abused 

as children generally can file 
lawsuits against their abusers 
until they turn 19 years old. The 
Associated Press reports the 
newly passed legislation gives 
survivors of child abuse a one-
year timeframe to file lawsuit for 
claims from as early 1997. Those 
sexually assaulted during adult 
years cannot sue retroactively. 

Earlier in the week, the bills 

were feared to be stuck in limbo 
as the Michigan Association 
of 
State 
Universities, 
which 

includes 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, 
requested 
the 

Senate delay voting, claiming 
the legislation would have a 
“profound impact” on public 
Michigan universities. MASU’s 
CEO Daniel Hurley wrote in a 
letter to lawmakers and Gov. Rick 
Snyder it would be crucial to take 
more time to consider potential 
effects of the legislation.

“We ask that decisions on 

these bills be delayed to allow 
for more analysis and discussion 
to ascertain their full impact,” 
Hurley wrote. 

State Sen. Margaret O’Brien, 

R-Kalamazoo, pushed back on 
these claims in a statement, 
saying criticism “is not surprising 
but very disappointing … I don’t 
understand what a delay would 
do except delay justice, or maybe 
the hope is to stop it entirely.”

The legislation also received 

criticism 
from 
governments, 

businesses, 
the 
Michigan 

Catholic Conference and others.

Democrats 
criticized 
the 

possibility of delaying voting on 
legislation. In a statement, State 
Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., D-East 
Lansing, stated drawing the line 
between support for survivors 
and support for institutions is 
critical.

“At the end of the day, we 

have to decide whether we want 
to stand with the survivors or 
whether we want to stand with 
the big institutions on this,” he 
said. “I think it’s fairly simple 
where we should be morally and 
that’s where I’m going to be.” 

State 
Sen. 
Mike 
Shirkey, 

R-Clarklake, 
voted 
against 

many of the bills, calling them 
“precedent-setting 
and 
very 

dangerous — things that we 
don’t have any clue what the 
unintended consequences are.”

For 
those 
in 
support 
of 

legislation, the vote in the Senate 
signaled an advancement in 
providing justice to survivors. 
State 
Sen. 
David 
Knezek, 

D-Dearborn Heights, sponsored 
the bill that extends the statute 
of limitations, and stated this 
particular bill can elevate the 
voices of those abused in the past 
and those who report such abuse.

“(The 
bill) 
allows 
every 

single individual who was a 
victim of Dr. Nassar’s to seek 
justice,” Knezek said. “We have 
a really unique opportunity to 
take Michigan out of the dark 
ages when it comes to our laws 
surrounding sexual assault, to 
give a voice to the victims who 
have been denied that voice for 
decades in some cases.”

need-based and 
a merit-based

the University of 
Michigan without 

it, and it’s also a

“I am a student 
who wants to 
make a change

Boyd said. “I 
realize that we 
have a voice, not 
just our parents.

Using the private sector for good

Teaching comprehensive U.S. history

ERIK NESLER | COLUMN

KRYSTAL HUR | COLUMN

R

ecently, I realized all of 
the American history 
classes 
I’ve 
been 

enrolled in thus far have taught 
primarily 
white 
American 

history. In my history classes, 
the teacher would briefly touch 
on the Trail of Tears, talk even 
more briefly about Japanese 
internment camps and discuss 
slavery. Slavery and related 
topics were always the most 
extensively taught part of U.S. 
history primarily concerning 
people of color. However, a 
report by the Southern Poverty 
Law Center (SPLC) revealed 
when a group of 1,000 high 
school 
seniors 
were 
asked 

to answer a multiple choice 
question about why the South 
seceded from the Union, only 
eight percent chose the right 
answer. So while my peers and 
I, who attended Ann Arbor 
public schools, might know 
the answer to that question 
is “to preserve slavery,” most 
people don’t know that answer. 
It seems as though none of us 
know much about the history 
of other cultural groups in the 
U.S., at least from what I’ve 
observed. This is problematic 
because people of color make 
up a huge chunk of the United 
States’s population and are 
a huge part of its history; 
omitting 
their 
histories 

creates a false and incomplete 
portrayal 
of 
United 
States 

history as a whole.

The 
problem 
of 
not 

teaching 
the 
histories 
of 

American 
people 
of 
color 

is not necessarily rooted in 
carelessness. The SPLC report 
also 
interviewed 
teachers, 

some 
of 
whom 
expressed 

why they feel uncomfortable 
teaching 
the 
histories 
of 

minorities. One teacher in 
Maine admitted, “I find it 
painful and embarrassing (as a 
white male) to teach about the 
history of exploitation, abuse, 
discrimination and outrageous 
crimes 
committed 
against 

African Americans and other 
minorities.”

Another 
teacher 
in 

California explained their fear 
that learning about slavery 
reduces Black people to slaves 
in the eyes of other students, 
commenting, 
“Sometimes 

it gives students the idea to 
call Black students slaves or 

tell them to go work in the 
field because of the lack of 
representation in textbooks.”

It’s 
understandable 

that 
teaching 
about 
how 

white Americans oppressed 
Americans 
of 
color 
could 

be embarrassing as a white 
person; however, this is not a 
valid excuse not to teach such 
histories. 
Leaving 
out 
the 

histories of people of color in 
the United States only acts 
as another way of oppression 
because it silences the voices of 
those who suffered. As painful 
or as embarrassing as it may 
be, their struggles must be 
remembered so we can learn 
from them to keep fighting 
against oppression.

As 
for 
the 
statement 

that textbooks have a lack 
of representation of certain 
groups and result in racism: 
Unfortunately, 
people 
will 

always find a way to be racist, 
no matter what is taught 
in schools. A foundation of 
racism is the idea that certain 
groups are homogenous and 
no differences exist between 
individuals. In addition, the 
teacher seems to be assuming 
that the only parts of history 
regarding 
minorities 
that 

are worth teaching are the 
injustices committed against 
them. While learning about 
such 
moments 
is 
clearly 

important, there’s more to 
people of color than their 
suffering. 
Therefore, 
if 

teachers are willing to perhaps 
go beyond the textbook and 
teach more about the history of 
minorities than just how they 
were (and still are) oppressed, 
students would also begin to 
understand people of color are 
not all the same.

Other than the lack of 

representation in my history 
classes, I’ve also noticed most of 
the books my English teachers 
have assigned for class, both 
at the University of Michigan 
and the schools I’ve previously 
attended, have been written by 
white writers. Occasionally, 
I would be assigned books by 
Black writers. I read Ralph 
Ellison’s 
“Invisible 
Man” 

senior year of high school, and 
I’ve been assigned to read a few 
of Christopher Paul Curtis’s 
books over the years as well.

However, books by other 

writers of other races have 
always been notably absent. 
While some of my teachers 
have assigned books by Black 
writers, as an Asian American, 
I am disappointed I had never 
been assigned to read a book by 
an Asian-American writer until 
this semester in my American 
culture 
class. 
I 
had 
also 

previously never read a book 
in which the main protagonist 
was Asian-American until this 
semester. I’m not sure if I’ve 
even ever been assigned to read 
a book with an Asian-American 
character at all.

I think that part of the 

reason teachers choose not to 
pick books by Asian Americans 
or books about the experiences 
of Asian American might be 
because they don’t have the 
confidence to teach it well — 
and the reason they don’t have 
the confidence is because they 
themselves as students barely 
learned anything about Asian-
American history in history 
class. As a result, I think when 
teachers attempt to diversify 
their 
reading 
assignments, 

they tend to choose books by 
Black writers, since they are 
at least a little more familiar 
with the topics of slavery and 
racism against Black people. 
Of course, not every book by 
a person of color is about the 
oppression of people of color. 
In addition, care should be 
taken not to read books by 
people of color and believe 
them to have no identity other 
than that of a victim. However, 
it is still important to teach 
the 
histories 
of 
America’s 

people of color to build a more 
comprehensive view of not just 
United States’ history but also 
of the United States today.

While I only touch on race 

in this article, and only three 
different ones at that, there is 
so much more that makes the 
U.S. such a diverse country, 
and these histories should be 
taught, too. Instead of only 
remembering white, cisgender 
and 
heterosexual 
historical 

figures and what they did for 
the country, we must remember 
what many, many others have 
made an impact too.

W

e have serious issues 
on 
this 
campus, 

issues 
that 
cannot 

be resolved with just hopeful 
promises. It is not enough to spew 
meaningless platitudes and vows 
that cannot be kept. If Central 
Student Government is to gain the 
trust of this university, then its 
candidates must be honest about the 
problems the University of Michigan 
faces and how these problems can 
be addressed. Today, aMplify will 
endeavor to do just that. Today, 
aMplify will tell the truth.

The truth is CSG must do 

more to engage its constituents. It 
cannot act as a bloated politburo 
that ignores the needs of its 
students. Our government must 
be reorganized to allow the 
voices of individual schools and 
students of all levels to be heard. 
Councils must give voice to those 
groups on campus that direct 
the course of the University. The 
CSG funding process must be 
reformed to encourage initiatives 
that are capable of effecting 
positive change. Government must 
operate in tandem with the clubs, 
fraternities and schools that form 
our cultural foundation. There can 
be no room for unilateral actions 
without dialogue. We must be 
accountable to each other.

The truth is your student 

government and university have 
failed to be transparent about 
its 
actions. 
Legislation 
was 

recently passed to reveal how 
representatives voted on the most 
important issues facing the student 
body, and yet those votes remain 
unpublished. 
As 
the 
election 

approaches, the voting behavior 
of candidates on issues like the 
attempt to compensate student 
government officials is shrouded 
in mystery. This vote proceeded 
despite the finite resources of 
CSG and the University, resources 
that could be better allocated 
toward the student body. On the 
University level, tuition increases 
are announced without sufficient 
advance 
notice 
and 
decisions 

are 
made 
without 
adequate 

explanation. 
This 
pattern 
of 

obfuscation must end. The student 
body must take part in the choices 
that shape its life.

The truth is meaningful action 

to protect our students and the 
learning environment from incidents 
of bias and assault must be taken. 
Evil has no place here, and CSG 
must push for strong administrative 
responses that respect both the law 
and the rights of those affected. That 
means implementing the proposed 
amendment to the student code of 
conduct, increasing the penalties 
for those who attack this sacred 
community. That means forming 
partnerships with faculty, staff 
and students to create consistent, 
meaningful, practical and effective 
responses to attacks on community 
members. That means community 
oversight 
of 
investigations 
of 

sexual misconduct, bigotry and 
impropriety at the University. That 
means a University accountable to 
its members.

The truth is people like 

Richard Spencer and Charles 
Murray 
will 
sometimes 
walk 

among us. At times, we must face 
those who cower behind the First 
Amendment as they spread their 
insidious rhetoric. Our response to 
groups who resort to instruments of 
fear to hide their own inadequacies 
and bigotry must be unyielding. We 
must react with morality, courage 
and peace to those cold and 
destructive souls who seek to sow 
seeds of division. Only then will 
they find unfruitful soil. To that 
end, CSG and the administration 
must provide clarity through open 
discussion, 
concrete 
processes 

and meaningful dialogues on how 
it intends to protect its students 
while promoting a variety of 
perspectives. 
Initiatives 
like 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, 
and programs like Wolverine 
Pathways, Intergroup Relations 
and the Go Blue Guarantee are a 
start, but they cannot be the end of 
our commitment to diversity. There 
must be an independent review 

board of the University’s actions 
on diversity and inclusion that does 
more than rubberstamp initiatives. 
The voice of the students must be 
equal to that of the administration.

The truth is the University will 

face issues like divestment and 
we must face them with reason 
and mercy. The harsh realities 
of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia 
and discrimination in all its forms 
must be acknowledged. We must 
recognize, too, that our actions 
in these cases have an impact far 
beyond the campus. They affect 
our alumni, our students, our 
faculty and staff, our employers, 
our families and our future. There 
is an obligation to consider, with an 
open mind, the reasoning of every 
expert and hear the perspective of 
all who are willing to offer their 
story. The University’s endowment 
and spending, in general, must 
be 
considered 
against 
this 

moral backdrop. The impact our 
financial choices have on every 
child and every alum across the 
globe must be considered as we 
act. Our economic behavior must 
be governed by a partnership 
of students and university that 
consciously reviews our financial 
choices and is answerable to 
students, staff and faculty.

The truth is the problems 

facing 
this 
campus 
are 
not 

insignificant and neither are we. 
Every point in our history has had 
challenges and Wolverines to face 
them down. This is not a resting 
point for the faint of heart, this is 
the home of victors valiant. Places 
like the University of Michigan 
are where the world changes for 
the better; people like you are why 
it does. We are here to support 
those Wolverines who defined our 
yesterdays, embrace our todays and 
shape our tomorrows. We are here 
to aMplify your voice.

I

n the wake of the tragic 
mass shooting in Parkland, 
Fla., a few weeks ago, 

several major companies have 
decided to publicly take a 
stance on the contentious gun 
control debate. Two major gun 
sellers, Walmart Inc. and Dick’s 
Sporting Goods Inc., recently 
raised the minimum age for 
gun buyers at their stores to 
21. Because of their power as 
a major distribution channel 
for gun manufacturers, the 
two companies were notable 
additions to the list of companies 
taking action after the tragedy 
in Parkland. 

Another 
intriguing 

development in the fight for 
stricter 
gun 
control 
in 
the 

U.S. was the recent New York 
Times story by Andrew Ross 
Sorkin in which he called for 
institutional investors to use 
their stakes in the gun industry 
to encourage internal reform. 
BlackRock, the largest investor 
in the world and an investor 
in several gun manufacturers, 
has recently committed itself to 
holding companies accountable 
to “not only deliver financial 
performance, but also show it 
makes a positive contribution to 
society.” As a major shareholder 
in several gun manufacturers, 
BlackRock 
could 
force 
the 

manufacturers 
to 
reform 

themselves voluntarily.

BlackRock would have to 

make a compelling, financial case 
as to why the companies would 
need to reform themselves, but it 
is nonetheless possible. Imagine 
if the private sector could push 
social change on its own — 
without the help (or coercion) of 
the government.

The recent stances companies 

have taken regarding the gun 
control 
debate 
piqued 
my 

interest in whether or not it 
was the private sector’s place 
to take political stances at all. 
It turns out companies have 
been taking loud and highly 
controversial political stances for 
years. In fact, corporations were 
supportive of the burgeoning 
LGBTQ movement before many 
liberal politicians were. Many 
companies began offering gay 
employees health care benefits 
for 
their 
significant 
others 

long before politicians began 
endorsing the practice.

With 
more 
and 
more 

companies taking political stances, 
companies that remain silent 
in an effort to appear impartial 
may be worse off. In a marketing 
class I took last semester, I 
learned how companies are now 
forming relationships with their 
most valuable customers. Social 
media has made this marketing 
objective much easier as we can 
all interact with our favorite 
companies through our phones. 
With this relationship, customers 
have come to expect their favorite 
brands to act and behave in a 
certain way — which may involve 
taking a controversial political 
stance. Companies that choose 
not to take a political stance miss 
out on forming these relationships 
with customers, which represents 
lost revenue potential.

There are disadvantages to 

taking a political stance, however. 
Companies 
have 
extremely 

diverse customers, so it is likely 
that they draw from both sides of 
the political spectrum. Taking a 
controversial political stance can 
result in outrage and lost sales from 
a potentially significant subset of 
a company’s customer base. When 
the founder of Chick-fil-A publicly 
opposed gay marriage, supporters 
of his decision decided to have 
a 
“Support 
Chick-fil-A 
Day” 

where the firm saw increased 
store traffic on that day. The 
enthusiasm from his supporters 
quickly waned while the boycotts 
from the adversaries continued 
for a much longer period of time. 
In addition, Ian Chipman wrote 
for Stanford’s Graduate School of 
Business that companies need to 
be sure to not make customers feel 
“queasy” about the brand, as such 
a feeling remains “permanently 
etched” in their brain. Companies 
may need to pick and choose 
topics on which they want to take 
a stand.

Despite 
the 
potential 

drawbacks, I like the idea of 
companies standing up for 
what they believe. The private 
sector has the salience and 
scale to push social change 
much than the government. 
Though numerous companies 
have 
been 
committing 

themselves to particular social 
issues like gun control, climate 
change and women’s rights, 
the private sector could be 
doing more.

I 
urge 
readers 
of 
this 

publication 
to 
purchase 

products from companies that 
share your social and political 
viewpoints. This past year saw 
the #DeleteUber movement as 
consumers were outraged by 
CEO Travis Kalanick’s ties to 
the Trump administration as 
well as his muted response to 
the Muslim travel ban. Because 
of the movement, over 200,000 
people deleted their Uber app. 
Consumers really do have the 
power to assist in changing the 
status quo. Vote with your dollar 
and put it toward something you 
care about.

A film headlined by some 

central relationship — be it 
two friends or two lovers — 
will often contain two very 
important 
components: 
A 

character who is a giver and one 
who is a taker. The former of the 
pair puts more of themselves 
into the relationship, leaving 
themselves more at risk to 
see their efforts unrequited; 
the latter lives far more aloof 
to their partner’s dedication, 
enabled 
yet 
unaware 
of 

their own assumed apathy. 
Structuring a relationship this 
way creates a slew of attractive 
dynamics between the two 
onscreen: 
Will 
the 
taker 

realize their selfishness and 
give something back? Will the 
giver ever become so fed up as 
to opt out? When the credits 
roll, what will be the status of 
the relationship between the 
two?

Writer/Director 
Corey 

Finley’s 
debut 
film 

“Thoroughbreds” goes a long 
way to turn these standards 
on their head, playing off of 
how 
his 
main 
characters’ 

relationship is expected to 
advance 
and 
reach 
some 

interesting areas. The film 
follows 
two 
New 
England 

teens, the preppie protagonist 
Lily (Anya Taylor-Joy, “The 
Witch” and “Split”) and her 
sociopathic sidekick Amanda 
(Olivia Cooke, “Me and Earl 
and the Dying Girl”), as they 
execute 
a 
murderous 
plot 

against 
Lily’s 
hated 
step-

father. Finley builds up Lily 
and Amanda’s relationship to 
one climactic sequence where 
the two girls must decide what 

they mean to each other, and 
what they mean to themselves. 
This great sequence features 
more 
than 
one 
surprising 

character twist that forces 
the audience to redefine the 
lines drawn in the sand, the 
separation of sanity and a once-
temporary 
temper 
tantrum 

no longer so clear. There 
are about 10 minutes where 
“Thoroughbreds” 
is 
great. 

Sadly, that is as much praise as 
can be given to the film. Apart 
from the penultimate scene, it 
isn’t worth the watch.

Which is disappointing more 

because of what is onscreen 

than what is not. There are the 
makings of a new-classic teen 
drama, but its poor pacing and 
misplaced dedication to an 
unnecessary horse motif get 
in the way. “Thoroughbreds” 
lacks narrative direction for 
far too long. The interesting 
part of the film, when two 
rich teenagers plan to murder 
one of their family members, 
isn’t 
committed 
to 
until 

the film is halfway into the 
second act. It dwells too long 
on Lily and Amanda’s sparse, 
uninteresting 
back 
stories 

and 
possible 
moments 
of 

disingenuous 
behavior 
for 

too long, not leaving enough 
time for what the audience 
bought tickets to see. Cooke’s 
character especially has some 
issues. The Patrick Bateman-
esque teen explains, minutes 
into 
the 
exposition, 
her 

analysts’ difficulty classifying 

her, practically giving her a 
new diagnosis at the end of 
every session. This is way 
overdone. 
The 
character 

acts 
mildly 
sociopathic 

throughout the film, yet the 
movie acts as though she is 
the most insane character to 
ever grace the silver screen. 
Amanda’s 
character 
flaws 

are a microcosm of a larger 
problem 
“Thoroughbreds” 

seems to have — it distrusts 
its 
audience 
to 
the 
point 

of failure, over explaining 
instead of allowing brevity to 
pack a punch. The harrowing 
climax 
mentioned 
above 

hits with dampened impact 
because it’s succeeded by 10 
more minutes of unnecessary 
fluff, turning what would have 
been a fantastic finale into a 
wasted penultimate sequence 
that screams bloody murder: 
“WHAT 
COULD 
HAVE 

BEEN?”

Adding 
insult 
to 
injury, 

“Thoroughbreds” 
is 

technically superb. It seems 
to take heavy influence from 
Iñárritu’s “Birdman” in both 
its cinematography and its 
simple, 
percussion 
based 

score. Finley’s tendency to 
gravitate toward long, tracking 
takes probably comes from his 
background as a playwright; 
some of the moments in the 
film feel almost made for the 
stage. Apart from maybe a tiny 
bit of overacting from the leads 
in their first scene together, the 
performances were impressive 
as well. “Thoroughbreds” had 
the potential to set the world 
on fire; instead, it will slip 
past the box office into early 
cycle 
irrelevance 
until 
it’s 

either inexplicably chosen by 
the spoon-throwing public as 
a cult classic, or until Finley 
returns to try again.

‘Thoroughbreds’ could 
have been a cult classic

FILM REVIEW

FOCUS FEATURES

“Thoroughbreds”

Focus Features

State Theater, Rave 

Theaters

This past week, I attended 

the 
Michigan 
Youth 

Ensemble’s concert at Hill 
Auditorium. 
The 
Michigan 

Youth 
Symphony 
Orchestra 

opened their portion of the 
concert with Michael Abels’s 
“Global Warming,” a short, 
eight-minute work for full 
orchestra. 
It 
was 
a 
slow, 

poignant piece full of haunting 
lyricism — certainly not what 
I expected of a piece about 
global warming.

Abels’s piece, it turns out, is 

not about global warming or 
anything relating to climate 
change. 
He 
composed 
the 

piece in 1991, intending the 
title to denote a warming 
of relations among separate 
cultures 
throughout 
the 

globe. On his website, Abels 
describes the piece as “folk-
like 
melodies 
of 
disparate 

cultures ... interwoven into a 
dazzling musical tapestry.” It 
is about the global warming of 
relations, not the gradual rise 
in temperature throughout the 
planet. Though confusing to 
modern audiences, this title 
can be quite easily explained 
when 
one 
considers 
the 

historical context.

The 
phrase 
“global 

warming” 
first 
came 
into 

use in scientific literature 
during the mid-’80s. It did not 
become part of the American 
vernacular 
until 
the 
late 

’90s or early 2000s. Many 
etymologists, in fact, point 
to Al Gore’s efforts during 
his vice presidency and his 
presidential campaign to raise 
awareness of climate change 
as the driving force behind 
the introduction of “global 
warming” into the everyday 
American vernacular.

Not only did the phrase 

“global 
warming” 
have 
a 

different meaning when Abels 
set about writing his piece, 
in all likelihood, it did not 
have any significant meaning 
to most Americans. Abels’s 
intention for the title of the 
piece, it seems, was to bring 
together two familiar concepts 
(the 
interconnectedness 
of 

our modern “global” culture 
and 
the 
“warming” 
of 

relations between cultures) 
in an unfamiliar linguistic 
and 
musical 
context. 
Our 

present understanding of this 
phrase, however, leads us to 
interpret the piece in new and 
unintended ways — during the 
performance, I struggled to 
separate my feelings about the 
current politics around climate 
related global warming from 
my understanding of the piece.

While this 20-year semantic 

shift may seem radical, shifts 
in meaning (and connotative 
meaning) of works of art occur 
all the time. Our propensity 
towards constant redefinition 
inevitably 
challenges 
the 

permanent 
and 
significant 

meaning that we attach to 
titles. Questions of original 
intent on the part of the creator 
and interpretative license on 
the part of the performer occur 
all the time, and while we 
may not always be cognizant 
of these questions, they exist 

below the surface of many 
great works of art.

Numerous 
words 
and 

phrases 
in 
Shakespeare’s 

great ouvre, for example, are 
understood quite differently 
today in comparison to their 
initial, 
intended 
meaning. 

My favorite is “the world’s 
mine 
oyster” 
from 
“The 

Merry Wives of Windsor.” 
This phrase appears in the 
dialogue 
between 
Falstaff 

and Pistol towards the middle 
of Act II. In modern times, 

we 
interpret 
this 
phrase 

as a statement about one’s 
potential and the treasures in 
front of one’s fingertips. In the 
play, however, Pistol qualifies 
the meaning of the phrase by 
vowing he will open this oyster 
“with sword.” Though modern 
audiences 
may 
interpret 

this phrase as a harmless or 
even positive expression of 
potential, Pistol uses it as a 
threat as to the violence he 
is willing to perpetrate to 
achieve his goals.

Another 
example 
of 

semantic shift is Nietzsche’s 
concept of the “übermensch” 
in his early works. In this 
instance, however, it is politics, 
and not widespread linguistic 
usage, that has obscured the 
original meaning of this word. 
When Nietzsche first used the 
phrase “übermensch,” he used 
it to describe a hypothetical 
higher state of man based not 
on religion but on atheistic 
moral 
principles. 
During 

the Nazi regime, however, 
this 
phrase 
was 
used 
to 

describe the supposed racial 
superiority of the Aryan race. 
For a long time after the fall 
of the Nazi regime, this word 
was ostracized for its racist 
political 
connotations. 
In 

the modern era, however, we 
have returned this word to its 
original, Nietzschean meaning 
— 
recent 
scholarship 
has 

provoked debate around what 
was once a clear consensus 
regarding 
Nietzsche’s 
anti-

Semitic beliefs.

Many semantic shifts around 

historical figures and pieces 
of art also inevitably taint 
their modern interpretation. 
We can never know the full 
extent to which we interpret 
art differently than its creator 
intended us to. While many 
historical fallacies exist, a few 
widespread 
misconceptions 

come to mind.

Michelangelo’s “The Last 

Judgement,” 
for 
example, 

is 
usually 
assumed 
to 
be 

among 
his 
best 
works, 
if 

not one of the best religious 

works in the Western canon. 
Historically, 
however, 
the 

work has undergone a radical 
critical transformation during 
its lifetime. While it is now 
immensely popular, it was 
controversoal and condemned 
upon 
its 
unveiling. 
Many 

prominent Catholic officials 
criticized its many naked forms 
— students of Michelangelo 
were eventually asked to add 
loin cloths to the work. The 
religious implications of the 
work have also undergone a 
radical transformation; though 
it was criticized at the time of 
its unveiling for its portrayal 
of 
nakedness, 
“The 
Last 

Judgement” is now an iconic 
part of the Sistine Chapel and 
the larger Holy See.

Another 
famous 
example 

of 
widespread 
historical 

misconception is the life and 
career of Wolfgang Amadeus 
Mozart. Much of the modern 
mysticism 
around 
Mozart’s 

life stems from the movie 
“Amadeus.” As in the movie, 
many 
people 
assume 
that 

Mozart died poor and largely 
forgotten; while some of his 
operas may have been popular, 
he was largely forgotten or 
neglected at the time of his 
death. However, during his 
lifetime, he was a popular and 
sophisticated composer. He 
was famous throughout his 
lifetime both for his skills at the 
keyboard and as a composer. 
He was frequently brought to 
the royal court to play before 
the leaders of Europe — while 
he may not have been as rich 
as our modern-day musical 
celebrities, 
he 
was 
never 

destitute or forgotten.

These 
semantic 
shifts 

have irrevocably altered our 
understanding of artists and 
artwork. 
If 
anything, 
the 

rate of these semantic shifts 
seem to be increasing as the 
internet allows for widespread 
misconceptions to spread as 
never before. While we may 
assume art to be independent 
of these changing semantics, 
it is important that we all 
approach art with our own 
prejudices.

Though 
these 
prejudices 

may be both founded and 
unfounded, they are almost 
always detrimental to full 
appreciation. And though we 
may assume artwork to exist 
in the past, our interpretations 
of art are illusive and ever-
changing. 
Eventually, 
we 

must accept the imperfection 
in our understanding of art. 
While we may strive to be 
as historically accurate as 
possible in this understanding, 
we must acknowledge that we 
can never be perfect. When we 
look at a painting we also look 
into a mirror; both the painting 
and 
our 
understanding 
of 

how we should interpret the 
painting appear in front of 
us. While this prohibits us 
from ever making tautological 
statements about artwork, it 
also allows us to interact with 
art over and over again. And 
while it is the most confusing 
aspect of art, it is also the most 
beautiful.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

A momentum inside of me 

pushes on — internalized — 
continuing the push-and-pull 
game that the international 
dance 
duo 
Wang 
Ramirez 

started 
with 
this 
past 

weekend at the Power Center. 
An 
exploration 
of 
physical 

limitations, social boundaries 
and 
human 
relationships 

ensued as the group took over 
the stage. I left not only inspired 
to fulfill a lost dream of learning 
to dance, but also to explore the 
corners of my mind. Through 
movement, the group created a 
dialogue on the boundaries and 
limitations both created by and 
imposed onto us.

Hip hop, aerial rigging, ballet 

and martial arts fused together 
to 
create 
a 
breathtakingly 

virtuosic 
and 
electrifyingly 

poetic 
production. 
Wang 

Ramirez 
have 
pushed 
the 

boundaries of what dance is 
through their style and, in 
doing so, have harnessed a 
power unattainable in classic 
form. The dancers started off 

by moving in and out of the 
silhouettes of two big silver 
cubes, experimenting with their 
physical relation to the shape. 
Throughout the performance, 
they pushed the audience to do 
the same with the cages built 
around us — to both consider 
and challenge social norms and 
the extent of our own freedoms. 
Without the need to satisfy the 
expectations that come with 
one style, Wang Ramirez were 
unfiltered in movement, obeying 
only the human body while also 
pushing the limits of their own 
physicality. With a new freedom 
in style and multiple dimensions 
in movement, the group begged 
the audience to explore the 
magnitudes of body and mind.

performer and what it meant 
to be an audience member. A 
dialogue between two dancers 
midway through and bits of 
humor spread throughout the 
performance 
further 
broke 

down the barrier, fully engaging 
the 
audience 
members. 
To 

end, the dancers each took 
turns improvising to a funky, 
upbeat song, with the audience 
clapping along; everyone left 
fully energized. 

With 
a 
minimalistic 

soundtrack, two large silver 
cubes created by several rails 
and a rigging system, the six 
dancers artfully maneuvered 
the stage. Sometimes using 
harnesses to become weightless 
and sometimes using just gravity 
and one another’s bodyweight, 
they incorporated suspension 
and reliance. At other times, 
the group moved independently, 
relying on their own momentum 
and force though breakdance, 
hip-hop 
footwork 
and 

contemporary 
dance. 
The 

aerial rigging system allowed 

the dancers to defy gravity, 
exploring new dimensions and 
broadening the scope of their 
own movement. With incredible 
strength and flexibility they not 
only just had the floor of the 
stage to work with, but also the 
space above. Walking up the side 
of another dancer, completely 

parallel to the floor, and floating 
above and along the railings of 
the silver cubes, Wang Ramirez 
constantly challenged gravity 
— transforming their palate 

of movement and allowing an 
exploration of the relationship 
between body and space.

From 
a 
social 
thought 

experiment on yelling “I love 
you” and “I hate you” to a bowl 
of rice, to crazy high heels 
and 
tutus, 
the 
production 

intrigued on countless levels. 
Incorporating 
both 
outward 

humor through gesture and 
occasional dialogue and an 
innate 
conversation 
that 

questioned 
human 
identity, 

there were many ways that 
individuals 
could 
have 

experienced the performance. 
Regardless, 
Wang 
Ramirez 

captured an attitude incredibly 
relatable to society today: a 
thoughtful 
seriousness 
that 

somehow does not take itself 
too seriously. “Borderline” is 
a production that challenges 
our 
most 
thought-provoking 

ideas today and still makes you 
laugh. It allowed the audience to 
enjoy, engage and explore what 
it means to be human — both in 
movement and in thought.

The whimsical indie rock outfit, 

of Montreal, has been consistently 
releasing music since their 1997 
debut LP, Cherry Peel. The band — 
frontman Kevin Barnes’s musical 
project for the past 11 years — floats 
through notes of soft indie-rock to 
erotic tones of ’80s electronic dance 
music in their most recent release, 
White is Relic/Irrealis Mood.

The house show sound and 

organic 
instrumentals 
in 
of 

Montreal’s past full-lengths is 
completely abandoned in White is 
Relic/Irrealis Mood. Throughout 
its 41-minute journey, the record 
adopts an electronic style. It’s 
cleanly produced, devoid of the 
playful jam-band sounds in records 
like Satanic Panic in the Attic, 
and its atmosphere feels more 
condensed than anything the band 
has released before.

White is Relic/Irrealis Mood 

takes listeners to a place with 
pulsing neon lights. The surging 
electricity 
hums 
through 
the 

various synth tones that come 
in waves throughout the record. 
There exists a level of tranquility 
that 
becomes 
interrupted 
by 

echoed bass beats — the type that 
moves from the speakers, injects 
itself into your lungs and tickles its 

way up your spine.

The 
album 
seems 
like 
a 

conglomeration 
of 
’80s 
EDM 

samples produced tightly into a 
singular identity. It moves through 
high pops of electro-dance energy 
and mellows itself into a soft dream 
with whispers of unexpected, but 
appropriate notes of the saxophone. 
It elicits a momentary experience 
of being lost, but its exciting nature 

shocks you back into its nightclub 
ambiance. You can almost see 
sweaty bodies moving in pure 
ecstasy, mesh shirts wrinkling 
together with drips of bright green 
eyeliner kissing cheeks.

The fluid electricity throughout 

the record climbs into space with 
robotic synth tones. The sharp 
and high-pitched instrumentals 
draw out, stretching to reach 
somewhere beyond this earth. In 
“Plateau Phase/No Careerism No 
Corruption,” Barnes’s hypnotic 
voice takes us to the precipice 
between space and time. He sings, 
“We can hear the dark matter 
breeding,” “If we put our ear to the 
ceiling / We can hear the multiverse 

ceding / We can hear the 
simulation wheezing.” On Barnes’s 
final note of “wheezing,” the bass 
beats skip like a scratched track of 
a CD, and the music collapses into 
sounds of laser beams.

The spacey and robotic sounds 

that are layered through the album 
adopt a more rigid identity when 
they reach its final song, “If You 
Talk to Symbol/Hostility Voyeur.” 
Being the album’s longest song, 
at eight-and-a-half minutes, it 
encompasses the record’s EDM 
exploration as it moves from short, 
structured synth hits to a final 
release of surreal bliss. The small, 
but rapid synths pulse from low to 
high tones as the drum pad beats 
fill the foreground. The song builds 
an exciting tension released by a 
return of the saxophones. Barnes 
places their croons of soft energy in 
an unnatural setting, but delivers it 
effortlessly; their arrival creates a 
harmonious relationship between 
the contrasting elements in the 
record, and then it all seeps into 
space.

The evolution in the sounds 

of White is Relic/Irrealis Mood 
transports us from the EDM 
nightclub into a pink fever dream. 
It leaves us laying on a cloud with 
time to take a deep, satisfying 
breath after a night of dancing 
amongst the stars and whispering 
to the planets.

“Love”

Season 3

Netflix

In season one of Netflix’s 

“Love,” Gus (Paul Rust, “I Love 
You Beth Cooper”) and Mickey 
(Gillian Jacobs, “Community”) 
were just two lost souls who met at 
a convenience store. In season two, 
their relationship blossomed from 
a timid friendship into a passionate 
and turbulent romance. Now, in its 
third and final chapter, Gus and 
Mickey have finally reached the 
point in their six months of dating 
that asks a glaring question: Will 
everything work out? 

While some might take issue 

with ending a show so soon, 
“Love” is one of those stories that 
finds fulfilling closure early on, 
even with a few imperfections 
along the way. This season finds 
creators 
Rust, 
Lesley 
Arfin 

(“Girls”) and Judd Apatow (“The 
Disaster Artist”) on their A-game: 
The writing remains top-notch, 
the cast is rock solid and the acting 
is all-around superb. Rust and 
Jacobs, in particular, continue to 
deliver searing and heartwarming 
performances, making the most of 
their equally flawed and endearing 
characters.

Gus’s deep-seated anger and 

Mickey’s self-sabotaging behavior 
have been explored and depicted in 
the first two seasons — and they’ve 
led to some pretty disastrous, 
cringeworthy consequences. But 
now, as their romance begins to 
percolate, Gus and Mickey are 
given room to fix their messy 
mistakes, and the outcomes of 
their conflicts are as sobering as 
they are immensely gratifying. 
They don’t actually get into a real 
fight until the fourth episode, “I’m 
Sick,” in which Gus misses a fun 
day with his friends to take care 
of an ill Mickey. Still, it feels oddly 
refreshing for a show that revolves 
all around the frustrations and 
bitterness that comes with a long-
term relationship.

New challenges test Gus and 

Mickey’s limits as a couple and as 

people: Gus decides to realize his 
erotic thriller screenplay, though 
his ego, temper and ambition 
threaten to derail the production. 
Meanwhile, 
Mickey 
navigates 

her sobriety and the burgeoning 
success of her radio career, but 
finds difficulty in dodging her 
impulses to drink and smoke. 
Other 
issues 
abound 
outside 

their world as well: Mickey’s 

Australian roommate, Bertie (the 
exemplary 
Claudia 
O’Doherty, 

“Trainwreck”), 
wrestles 
with 

leaving 
her 
schlubby, 
doofus 

boyfriend Randy (Mike Mitchell, 
“Comedy Bang! Bang!”) for the 
attentive and affectionate Chris 
(Chris Witaske, “Lady Bird”). 
She even gets her own episode — 
the season’s highlight “Bertie’s 
Birthday” — which marks a 
delightful acting showcase for 
O’Doherty. Seriously, she deserves 
her own spinoff. 

While the final season tracks 

the highs and lows of its main 
characters, “Love” still struggles 
to mitigate the inconsistency of its 
peripheral characters, specifically 
with Randy, Gus’s co-workers and 
his boss Susan (Tracie Thoms, 
“The Drowning”) and Mickey’s 
ex-boss 
Greg 
(Brett 
Gelman, 

“Stranger Things 2”). With the 
exception of Randy, who comes off 
as a well-meaning but bumbling 
oaf, these other characters are 
so 
unrelentingly 
insufferable, 

so unnecessarily cruel and so 
menacingly mean-spirited at times 
— the worst comes in the rough 
third episode “Arya and Greg” — 
that their presence almost ruins 
the season entirely. What makes 
“Love” so watchable and nuanced 
is its emphasis on realism and 
observational humor, so seeing 
these bit characters portrayed as 
cartoonish, loathsome assholes 
with no real 
redeemable 

qualities and no real purpose in 
driving the plot forward is quite 
frankly disappointing.

Even so, “Love”’s third season 

manages to bounce back pretty 
quickly in the second half, where 
Gus and Mickey reach an all-time 
high in their professional lives, but 
uneasily confront uncomfortable 
truths 
and 
relationship 

predicaments in their personal 
lives. The standout “Sarah from 
College” 
finds 
Gus 
revisiting 

some skeletons in his closet when 
he bumps into an old flame at a 
friend’s wedding (a remarkable, 
subdued guest performance from 
Vanessa Bayer, “Saturday Night 
Live”).

Gus’s past continues to play 

a role in the uncertainty of 
his relationship with Mickey 
when they venture to visit his 
family in South Dakota, a trip 
that includes some of the most 
hilarious 
and 
heartbreaking 

moments in the entire series. In 
the two episodes preceding the 
finale, Gus and Mickey offer two 
phenomenal monologues that feel 
like a brilliant, almost cathartic 
culmination of their relationship. 
The chaotic energy that radiates 
from their individual inner turmoil 
during these monologues is like a 
rocket ship getting ready to launch: 
The fire is bubbling at the surface, 
but it doesn’t reach liftoff until 
enough buttons have been pushed. 
Despite how ominous that may 
sound, let’s just say “Love” allows 
Gus and Mickey space to breathe 
and collect themselves before 
they make any major decisions in 
moving their relationship forward.

“Love” 
has 
become 
more 

than just a commentary about 
contemporary 
dating 
and 

modern relationships. It has also 
become more than just a simple 
TV romance created by one of 
Hollywood’s most beguiling and 
notable 
rom-com 
visionaries. 

“Love” is as unpredictable and 
exciting, as hilarious and messy 
as love itself, which is exactly 
what makes its conclusion so 
imperfectly perfect.

‘Love’ triumphs in the end

TV REVIEW

NETFLIX

TRAILER REVIEW: ‘FANTASTIC BEASTS’

 

The first “Fantastic Beasts,” 
released two years ago to aver-
age reviews and a decent box 
office, is a largely forgotten 
addendum to 
the far more 
popular “Harry 
Potter” saga 
that preceded 
it. Now comes 
the trailer for 
“Fantastic 
Beasts: The 
Crimes of Grin-
delwald,” which promises to 
bring the magic back to the saga. 
Hogwarts! Dumbledore! The 
Deathly Hallows! This trailer 
doubles down on references to 

the original boy wizard story, 
loudly proclaiming that if you 
weren’t on board with the seem-
ingly disconnected first film, 

this one might 
still be for you. 
The one thing you 
won’t find much 
of in this trailer 
is the titular vil-
lain, Grindelwald. 
Warner Bros. and 
J.K. Rowling have 
been mired in 

controversy for years now over 
the casting of alleged domestic 
abuser Johnny Depp in the role 
and this latest trailer, which fea-
tures only a fleeting moment of 

Depp, is unlikely to convince 
anyone that those criticisms 
aren’t valid. That won’t matter 
to many though, and it’s doubt-
less that Warner Bros. simply 
hopes that those familiar musi-
cal notes at the end of the trailer 
do their job and get more butts 
in the seats. There’s set to be 
three more of these “Beasts” 
films over the next six to eight 
years, but the jury is still out on 
whether this new series of “Pot-
ter” films will be considered a 
worthy addition to the canon or 
a horribly expensive and mis-
guided mistake.

A dream come true for Flaherty and Dunston

D

espite never having 
played in the NCAA 
Tournament, senior 

forward Jillian Dunston is 
confident in the Michigan 
women’s basketball team’s 
chances in March Madness.

She said as much this past 

Wednesday, with a declaration: 
“We’re not 
afraid of any 
team.”

And why 

would they 
be?

Under 

Dunston’s 
leadership, 
the 
Wolverines 
have amassed 
a 22-9 overall 
record, including marquee wins 
over Marquette, Nebraska, Ohio 
State and Maryland — all of 
which are also slated to compete 
in the Big Dance. She’s coming 
off a strong regular season, 
where she was one of the top 
rebounders in the Big Ten with 

an average of 9.1 per game.

She serves as a much-needed 

supplement to her fellow 
classmate — guard Katelynn 
Flaherty — who is one of the 
best scorers in the country.

But while her buoyancy could 

be warranted, it could also 
simply be ignorance.

Michigan is surely a very 

good basketball team. But how 
they compare to the nation’s 
elite is still to be determined.

They do hold wins over 

ranked conference foes in then-
No. 8 Buckeyes and then-No. 
13 Terrapins. However, the 
Wolverines were routed in their 
two games against ranked non-
conference opponents — then-
No. 5 Louisville and then-No. 
3 Notre Dame. Though those 
games were early in the season, 
they weren’t even close, as 

Michigan was outscored by 
a combined 45 points. And, 
as impressive as its Big Ten 
wins were, conference games 
always possess an element of 
unpredictability that should be 
accounted for.

If the 

Wolverines 
do get past 
10th-seeded 
Northern 
Colorado on 
Friday, they 
have a lofty task 
ahead of them 
in Baylor. The 
Lady Bears (31-1) 
are a two seed as 
the No. 2 team in the country. 
They possess the second-best 
offense in the nation, scoring 
86.6 points per game. For 
comparison, Michigan ranks 

35th and averages 75.5.

Let’s face it, the Wolverines’ 

chances are far from ideal.

But they have come a 

long way. They are the first 
Michigan team to make the 

tournament 
since 2013. 
They have also 
secured wins 
over rivals 
Ohio State and 
Michigan State.

And the 

seniors — 
Dunston and 
Flaherty — 
have come the 
furthest in their 

four years in Ann Arbor. The 
tournament is a chance for 
them to show off just how good 
they really are.

“For them to be on the 

national scene, they’ve 
established themselves as 
two of the best players in the 
country,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “For the 
rest of the world to have an 
opportunity to see Katelynn 
Flaherty I think is really 
important. She’s been really 
special for us and it’s going to 
great for her to be playing in 
front of national television.”

The senior duo has certainly 

left its mark.

Including postseason play, 

the two have amassed 91 wins 
at Michigan. And while it’s the 
lesser of the two tournaments, 
the pair helped the Wolverines 
raise their first-ever banner 
in Crisler Center with a 2017 
WNIT Championship. Now, 
they have qualified for the 
NCAA Tournament.

“(The Tournament) was our 

main goal,” Dunston said. “And 
now that we’ve gotten there, we 
don’t want to just show up. We 
just want to continue to take 
care of business.”

On an individual level, 

Flaherty will leave Michigan 
the program’s all-time leading 
scorer in her four years as a 
starter. As for Dunston, she has 
been the outspoken leader for 
the Wolverines for the past two 
seasons. She also has the third-
most rebounds and 11th-most 
steals in Michigan history.

And most of all, the two have 

now accomplished a lifelong 
ambition.

“We’ve worked so hard to 

get to this point,” Flaherty said. 
“I know it’s been both of our 
dreams since we were young 
girls to go to college and play 
in the NCAA Tournament. So 
to finally make it here our last 
year is really exciting.”

Defense derails Wolverines
in 8-3 loss to Lawrence Tech

With two outs in the top of the 

seventh inning, Ako Thomas saw 
a hard hit grounder squirt off his 
glove as two runners crossed the 
plate. Lawrence Tech’s Joseph 
Russo had smashed a ball at the 
junior shortstop, who attempted to 
field it on a hop. The play extended 
the Blue Devils’ lead to 7-3 before 
another single completed the six-
run inning, and gave Lawrence 
Tech an 8-3 advantage that it held 
over the final two frames.

The play not only put the 

Michigan baseball team in a 
hole from which it was unable to 
recover, but served as a microcosm 
of the Wolverines’ 
disastrous 
start 

to 
the 
season. 

After establishing 
themselves 
as 

one of the Big 
Ten’s 
premier 

defensive units a 
season ago, they 
have committed 
27 errors in just 15 
games.

“It’s 
just 

another game where we played 
very sloppy on defense and gave 
the opposition a huge inning,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. “The 
four errors stand out, but it’s just 
the execution of playing defense 
and taking care of the baseball.”

While the errors have been a 

huge blemish on Michigan’s 4-11 
start, they have been far from the 
only problem. Their three-run 
output 
Wednesday 
afternoon 

marked the third consecutive 
game in which the Wolverines 
have scored four runs or fewer.

“The defensive side of things 

… is causing the hitters to get 
behind a hole,” Bakich said, “and 
then they start pressing. They’re 
not 
stringing 
quality 
at-bats 

together because they’re looking 
at climbing out of a deficit.”

The 
correlation 
between 

defensive struggles and offensive 
stagnation cannot be ignored. 
Michigan jumped out to an early 
lead courtesy of a RBI groundout 

and single from redshirt junior 
Miles 
Lewis 
and 
freshman 

outfielder 
Jesse 
Franklin, 

respectively.

Minutes after Franklin’s single 

put the Wolverines’ in control, 
though, 
the 
lead 
crumbled 

in an all-too-familiar turn of 
events. 
Freshman 
shortstop 

Jack Blomgren short-hopped a 
throw that skipped past Franklin, 
allowing Lawrence Tech’s first run 
to score and igniting Michigan’s 
collapse.

“It was the little things again,” 

Bakich said, “and it’s the little 
things that have plagued us all 
year and that is something that 
we are absolutely laser-focused on 
and that we are going to work to 

correct.”

Two 
innings 

later, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
defensive 
woes 

compounded, as 
the Blue Devils 
plated 
four 

unearned 
runs 

in their six-run 
seventh. 
The 

first run of the 
inning 
scored 

on a double into the corner after 
sophomore right fielder Christian 
Bullock missed the cut-off man, 
allowing Tyler Cleasby to score 
from first.

Three pitches later, with a 

man on third and the infield in, a 
hard-hit grounder found junior 
second baseman Blake Nelson. 
Even a high throw from Nelson 
easily beat Cleasby to the plate 
before redshirt freshman catcher 
Marcus Chavez mishandled the 
throw, allowing the go-ahead 
run to score. Five batters and a 
pitching change later, Thomas’ 
error pushed the Michigan deficit 
to four.

“We’re letting one negative play 

turn into three negative plays,” 
Bakich said. “If something bad 
happens, we just got to be able to 
shut it down and get back to the 
positive side of things.”

In a familiar refrain, one bright 

spot for the Wolverines came 
from its starting pitching. Junior 

southpaw 
William 
Tribucher 

went five innings, allowing one 
unearned run on three hits while 
striking out four Lawrence Tech 
hitters. It was the fifth game in 
seven in which Michigan’s starter 
gave up three runs or less — a 
stretch over which the Wolverines 
have gone 2-5.

“It was encouraging,” Bakich 

said. “(Tribucher) threw strikes, 
he was aggressive in the strike 
zone, he was very consistent 
and executed his pitches well. … 
In those five innings, he looked 
pretty good. He looked like the 
Will Tribucher that we know he 
is.”

Ultimately, 
though, 
the 

starting pitchers’ performances 
need to carry over the rest of the 
team.

“We’re just gonna stick with 

it,” Bakich said. “We’re gonna 
continue to believe that we’ve got 
good players and a good team and 
we’re just gonna keep a relentless 
focus and attack on the little things 
and make sure that if we take care 
of those, then the big things like 
the outcome of the game will take 
care of itself.”

Michigan crushed by yet 
another mid-game surge

With the seventh inning 

looming, the Michigan baseball 
team was sitting pretty.

Junior left-hander William 

Tribucher 
had 
just 
tossed 

five inspiring innings against 
Lawrence 
Tech, 
relenting 

only one unearned run and 
propelling 
the 
Wolverines 

(4-11) to a 3-1 lead. Michigan 
was hitting in stride against 
the Blue Devils (17-9) and 
ended the fifth with an RBI 
single from sophomore catcher 
Harrison Salter.

The sixth inning followed, 

and went off with only a 
minor hitch. Junior reliever 
Troy Miller had entered the 
game and immediately gave 
up a home run. Michael Rinke 
demolished the ball, sending it 
past the left field fence on the 
opposite side of the park. Miller 
quickly 
found 
redemption 

by striking out his next two 
opponents. 
The 
Wolverines 

closed out the inning without 

securing a run.

Then came disaster.
Miller quickly struck out the 

first batter, then gave up two 
runs with seemingly as much 
haste. Miller had racked up two 
earned runs and didn’t show 
any signs of slowing down 
when Michigan 
coach 
Erik 

Bakich 
made 

a 
desperate 

pitching 
change. Senior 
right-hander 
Jayce 
Vancena 

entered 
the 

game 
and 

allowed 
four 

additional runs 
before stopping 
the bleeding with a much-
needed strikeout.

When 
the 
dust 
settled, 

the Wolverines had given up 
six runs off three hits and 
committed 
three 
defensive 

errors. All in one inning.

“Sloppy,” Bakich said. “It 

was the little things again, 
and it’s the little things that 
have plagued us all year and 
that is something that we are 
absolutely 
laser-focused 
on 

and that we are going to work 
to correct.”

For this Michigan team, it’s a 

broken record. The Wolverines 
consistently put themselves in 
a great position to contend for 
each game through four or five 
innings, then sluggish bats and 
sloppy defense seal their fate.

Michigan has lived by this 

routine in many of its previous 
contests, dropping games to 
Lipscomb, Stanford and San 
Diego State in similar fashion.

In a textbook example of 

this pattern, the Wolverines 
had held the Aztecs scoreless 
through four innings when 
they faced them on Feb. 26. 
San Diego State subsequently 
exploded onto the scoreboard 
with a four-run fifth inning, 
giving it a 4-1 lead. From there, 
Michigan didn’t have enough 
firepower to claw itself out of 

the deficit, ultimately losing, 
4-3.

It’s troubling for any team 

to have destructive habits, 
especially this early in the 
season. However, the one silver 
lining in this disappointing 
start is that the team now 

knows what to 
fix — and has 
time to fix it.

“We’re 
not 

taking care of 
the 
baseball 

and 
we’re 

letting 
one 

negative 
play 

turn into three 
negative plays,” 
Bakich said. “If 
something bad 

happens, we just gotta be able 
to shut it down and get back 
to the positive side of things. 
What you’re seeing right now 
is a team whose confidence is 
shook.”

In addition to regaining 

confidence, 
leadership 
and 

high-quality 
play 
are 
also 

needed to aid this battered 
squad. When one player does 
well, it seems to carry over to 
the rest of the team.

Behind Tribucher’s bright 

performance 
also 
lied 
a 

solid defensive outing that, 
at the end of it, pushed the 
Wolverines 
into 
the 
lead. 

Things took a turn for the 
worse once the pitching and 
defense became sloppy.

“Right now, the defensive 

side of things is causing the 
pitching to be out there a long 
time,” Bakich said. “It’s causing 
the hitters to get behind a hole 
and then they start pressing. 
They’re not stringing quality 
at-bats 
together 
because 

they’re looking at climbing out 
of a deficit.

“It’s just all connected, so 

we just gotta get rid of this 
feeling and get back to what we 
know how to do, which is work 
extremely hard and trust that 
our training is going to take care 
of the outcome on the field.”

A few weeks ago, Luke Wil-

son almost punched Zavier 
Simpson.

The freshman scout-teamer 

thought Simpson was fouling 
him in practice, and as another 
rough play resulted in Wilson’s 
second-straight turnover, he 
shoved the starting point guard 
in the chest with both hands.

That’s how freshman guard 

CJ Baird, a walk-on like Wil-
son, described it in the Michi-
gan men’s basketball team’s 
locker room in Wichita, Kan., 
the day before the Wolverines 
begin the NCAA Tournament 
against Montana. Simpson and 
Wilson crowded near Baird, the 
independent, third-party story-
teller, making sure they weren’t 
portrayed unfairly.

From all accounts, the situ-

ation didn’t escalate after that. 
Teammates stepped in and 
cooler heads prevailed.

But the scene is emblematic 

of a larger theme. The scout 
team, walk-ons and all, has 
pride too.

Of course, that doesn’t nor-

mally manifest itself in physi-
cal altercations at practice. It 
shows itself in the job the scout 
team has to do: prepare the 
starters by any means neces-
sary.

“(We’re) still trying to learn 

all the concepts of the entire 
system and then still trying to 
show you’re capable to push 
these guys, and you can fit in, 
and you can run scout, and you 
can prepare them,” said fresh-
man walk-on guard Rico Ozu-
na-Harrison. 
“It’s 
definitely 

a challenge every day. … You 
don’t want to get punked.”

That pride comes from more 

than just individual basketball 
skill. Take sophomore guard Ibi 
Watson, for example.

Ask different Michigan play-

ers, and they’ll all tell you Wat-
son can hold his own. But the 
part of a scout-teamer is that of 
a method actor. They meticu-
lously study their role, learning 
the rhythm and movement of an 
opposing player, before emulat-
ing it for themselves. Then they 
move on to the next role.

So Watson isn’t just playing 

like Watson. He’s playing like a 
totally different person.

 “Sometimes 

I get yelled at, 
because I might 
be playing a guy 
who is strictly a 
3-point shooter, 
and I’m trying 
to create or do 
something 
too 

much,” Watson 
said. “But usu-
ally I try as hard 
as I can to play 
as similarly to that player as 
possible.”

Watson had an important job 

this week. His was the role of 
Montana guard Michael Ogu-
ine, a hyper-aggressive slasher 
who averages 15.8 points per 
game for the Grizzlies.

It’s a role that apparently 

allowed Watson to showcase his 
own ability, as multiple team-
mates pointed to him as some-
body who shined on the second 
unit this week. Senior guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahk-

man, who often guards Watson 
in practice, was less eager to 
admit his impressiveness. 

“He doesn’t really score on 

me as much,” Abdur-Rahkman 
joked. “… It definitely helps, 
though, when you can have a 
player that caliber on the scout 
team. Sometimes they’re better 
than the people that we’re actu-
ally playing, and that definitely 
helps.”

The rest of the scout team 

had their own assignments. 

Somebody was Oregon transfer 
Ahmaad Rorie, and somebody 
was 6-foot-8 forward Jamar 
Akoh. When the buzzer sounds 
Thursday, barring an unex-
pected upset, those roles will be 
forgotten, and Watson, Baird, 
Wilson and Ozuna-Harrison 
will prepare to emulate either 
Houston or San Diego State.

It’s a thankless job. In fact, 

when coaches and players pub-
licly credit the scout team, it’s 

brushed 
off 

as cliché. The 
NCAA Tourna-
ment is the only 
time all season 
they all get to 
just travel with 
the team.

But 
that’s 

okay with them. 
They find their 
fulfillment 
in 

other ways.

“I think one of the coolest 

things is realizing where you’re 
at, and how lucky you are to be 
in this position,” Baird said. “I 
think the scout team, as a whole, 
takes pride in it, and we go at 
them 100 percent every day.”

The scout team takes pride 

in their day-to-day effort. They 
take pride in acting out a role to 
the best of their ability.

“Whether 
we’re 
running 

(opponent’s) plays or emulating 
how a certain player works on 
the floor, it definitely gives our 
defense a better look and helps 
us prepare better for the game,” 
Baird said. “And it’s really cool, 
once you’ve emulated that play-
er, and you see them out on the 
court next time you play, it’s 
cool to see, like, ‘Wow, that’s 
actually what they do. We actu-
ally worked on that.’ ”

It shows in the team’s prepa-

ration when the bright lights 
are on. And sometimes, it shows 
in practice, with a shove to the 
starting point guard.

Back to do it all again
W

ICHITA, Kan. — 
Moritz Wagner 
thinks back to the 

Oregon game, but not in the way 
you might assume.

He objects to the notion that 

he lost last year’s Sweet 16 game 
on his own. 
He objects 
to the notion 
that anyone 
can lose any 
single game. 
Heck, he even 
objects to the 
notion that 
he played that 
poorly.

“I never 

feel that way,” the junior center 
said Wednesday afternoon, “that 
it’s somebody’s fault, that it’s my 
fault that we lost.”

Wagner went 3-for-10 from 

the field and 0-for-4 from 3-point 
range in the 69-68 season-ending 
loss, scoring just seven points as 
his team bowed out of the field. 
This came less than a week after 
he carried his team to an upset 
win over No. 2 seed Louisville 
with 26 points on 11-of-14 
shooting from the field.

If his performance against 

Louisville was the crescendo 
on an ascendant sophomore 
campaign, the Oregon game was 
the distasteful piano crash at the 
end.

It would have been easy then 

to point fingers, connect some 
dots and assume Wagner’s 
withdrawal from the NBA draft 
months after was some sort of 
impassioned vow to do better — 
to carry this team on his back 
to heights it fell just short of last 
year — all while improving his 
stock to be a surefire NBA player.

That would fit a traditional 

narrative of college athletes. 
To be fair, that’s all part of 
it. He has improved in many 
facets, including going from 
4.2 rebounds per game to 7.1 
rebounds per game. He would 
love to advance past the Sweet 
16 for the first time in his career, 
especially as a team captain and 
leading scorer.

The reality is much more 

simple, though: Moritz Wagner 
loves college basketball.

He loves all the hoopla. He 

loves draining a three and then 
dangling his tongue out at the 
fans or his opponent. He loves 
the conference rivalries and the 

bright lights of March. He loves 
the process of it all as much as 
he yearns for the glory. He loves 
to be loved almost as much as he 
loves to be hated.

“They hate me everywhere,” 

Wagner says, grinning ear to ear. 
“I know that. It’s fun. I’ve kind of 
embraced that role. And I’ve got 
to be honest, I’d hate myself, too.

“I just tell myself, they hate 

you because I’m good.”

All of this came across in the 

locker room the afternoon before 
the first round of an NCAA 
Tournament that may well be his 
last, and could easily define his 
legacy at Michigan.

He won’t look at it that way, 

though, at least not in the 
moment. Wagner isn’t going 
to publicly relish the personal 
accolades that may come from 
the next month. He certainly 
didn’t after winning the Big Ten 
Tournament Most Outstanding 
Player less than two weeks ago. 
There’s a distinction between 
arrogance on the court and 
selfishness off it, and while one 
could argue the former, nobody 
could viably claim the latter.

Wagner, despite his 

boisterous on-court and off-
court persona, is hesitant to 
ever make guarantees or grand 
proclamations. He didn’t come 
back to Michigan to make a 
Final Four, explicitly at least. 
He came back to get better with 
a team he loves at a university 

he cherishes. And he’s not going 
to sacrifice his momentary 
pleasure — no matter how 
minute or trivial it may seem — 
for some external end goal, or to 
overcome a non-existent burden 
from the exit last March.

“These things are fun, these 

things are the things you never 
forget,” Wagner says, peering 
around the locker room. 

To his left, the five walk-ons 

— traveling together for the first 
time on the road with the team — 
are joking around in a circle. To 
his right, freshman guard Jordan 
Poole plays hangman on the 
whiteboard with junior forward 
Brent Hibbits.

“Whether the games go well, 

bad,” Wagner continues, “this is 
the type of stuff that is so much 
fun around here that we would 
never experience in any other 
way.”

Minutes later, Wagner 

gleefully trots through warmup 
calisthenics at the team’s open 
practice with round one of the 
2018 NCAA Tournament set 
to kick off a day later. He and 
Michigan assistant coach Saddi 
Washington trade some playful 
banter, before Washington 
raises his tone a few octaves in 
Wagner’s direction.

“Your time to shine, baby.”
