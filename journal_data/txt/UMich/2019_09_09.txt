ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

This year’s Festifall was 
bigger than ever, with 623 
students organizations setting 
up tables in North Ingalls 
Mall, according to the Center 
for Campus Involvement. 
Last 
year,approximately 
500 clubs participated in the 
annual club fair, which is held 
on the first Friday of school 
each year.. According to Devon 
Vaughn, 
the 
organization 
consultant for the Center for 
Campus 
Involvement, 
they 
needed to add more tables and 
spread out to make more space 
for more new clubs on campus 
this year. 
LSA senior Amanda Gross, 
co-President 
of 
MUSIC 
Matters, 
a 
student-run 
nonprofit that hosts concerts 
on campus, explained Festifall 
has always been instrumental 
in attracting a variety of new 
members to the club. 
“We want to get as many 
kids as possible,” Gross said. 
“A large bulk of the kids that 
do show up — we get their 

signatures through Festifall. 
We don’t want to have to 
target any specific groups on 
campus and this way anybody 
who wants to can find out 
about us.”

Business sophomore Nina 
Farahanchi, a member of the 
Persian Students Association, 
was dancing in front of his 
organization’s 
table 
with 
a 
boombox 
in 
one 
hand. 

Farahanchi emphasized that 
it’s the energy at Festifall that 
draws potential members in.

published an article last month 
notifying patients about a

breach. An estimated 5,500 
patients were put at risk due to 
an email phishing campaign.
The 
incident 
occurred 
when an email containing 
a malicious link was sent 
to 3,200 employees in July. 
Three employees clicked on 
the link.
“Employees were directed

In an effort to combat the 
formally-recognized 
public 
health emergency of youth 
vaping, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
and the Michigan Department 
of Health and Human Services 
announced a ban on the sale 
of flavored e-cigarette juice 
on 
Wednesday. 
With 
just 
over three weeks before the 
ban goes into place, many 

local Ann Arbor businesses 
and University of Michigan 
students have been left to 
consider the next steps in 
response to the state-wide ban.
This announcement follows 
a spike in high school students’ 
e-cigarette use between 2017 
and 2018, as well as a surge 
in 
national 
attention 
paid 
to 
vaping-related 
illnesses 
becoming more common across 
the country. The announcement 
also follows e-cigarette brand 

Juul’s decision last November 
to stop selling fruity flavors 
in gas stations, allowing them 
only 
in 
designated 
smoke 
shops.
According to LSA junior Zac 
Kolbusz, the University has a 
pervasive “nicotine culture” 
which will be heavily affected 
by the ban.
“I feel like a lot of people 
get here for the first time, try 
it at a party or something, and 
from that point on, there is the 

big risk of addiction,” Kolbusz 
said.
Though Kolbusz uses a Juul 
himself, he says he supports the 
ban and believes Whitmer “did 
the right thing.” As a result of 
the ban, Kolbusz said he and 
many of his friends will try to 
quit using nicotine. However, 
Kolbusz is fearful the ban may 
turn many previous e-cigarette 
users onto cigarettes instead.

Since North Korea began 
building 
their 
nuclear 
arsenal, 
maintaining 
diplomacy with North Korea 
has been a point of contention 
in the United States. The 
individual tasked with the 
challenge of negotiating U.S. 
diplomatic efforts with North 
Korea is U.S. Representative 
for North Korea, Stephen 
Biegun. He spoke at a packed 
Rackham 
Auditorium 
on 
Friday 
afternoon 
as 
the 
inaugural speaker in a launch 
series organized to celebrate 
the opening of the Weiser 
Diplomacy 
Center, 
hosted 
by the Ford School of Public 
Policy.
Biegun serves on behalf 
of U.S. Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo and directs all 
U.S. policy talks on North 
Korea, leads negotiations and 
spearheads U.S. diplomatic 

efforts 
with 
allies 
and 
partners. Previously, Biegun 
worked as a foreign policy 
advisor 
to 
members 
of 
Congress and was formerly 
the 
vice 
president 
of 
International Governmental 
Relations for Ford Motor 
Company.
Public Policy Dean Michael 
Barr introduced the series and 
explained the significance of 
the Ford Public Policy talks 
and fostering conversation in 
polarizing political times.
“As you well know, these 
are 
challenging 
times 
in 
our nation, with fractious 
political discourse, gridlock 
and 
partisanship 
and 
increasing lack of trust in 
institutions 
everywhere,” 
Barr said. “It is in moments 
like this when the craft of 
diplomacy 
is 
even 
more 
essential.”

“Anytime 
you 
have 
someone that’s addicted to 
a substance and pull the 
rug out, there’s going to be 
little issues in the day-to-
day life,” Kolbusz said. “I’m 
hoping that people actually 
try and quit. I know that’s 
what I’m trying to do, but 
expectations aren’t always 
results. With any drug, 
with any kind of substance, 
there’s 
certain 
things 
going on that make it hard 
to quit.”
Kolbusz 
believes 
students will find creative 
ways to get Juul pods on 
campus and could turn to 
cigarettes if all else fails.
According 
to 
local 
smoke 
shops, 
the 
ban’s 
announcement 
has 
not 
yet 
slowed 
e-cigarette 
sales. Clifton Whinery, an 
employee at Ann Arbor’s 
Bongz and Thongz, said the 
upcoming ban has actually 

done the opposite. Whinery 
said he saw more people 
coming in and buying bulk 
over the weekend than he 
has in the past.
“I believe, if anything, 
it’s been easier to sell the 
things because everybody’s 
in 
hiatus 
(from 
not 
smoking) you know, ‘Oh my 
goodness. They’re taking 
our vape away,’” Whinery 
said.
Patricia 
King, 
owner 
of 42 Degrees art gallery 
and glass shop, refuses to 
sell tobacco products in 
her store given the effect 
it has been proven to have 
on users’ health. However, 
King said she has seen 
many 
people 
over 
the 
past few days coming into 
her shop and requesting 
e-cigarette pods.
“We actually, at some 
point, looked into (selling 
e-cigarette juice), because 
it 
would 
be 
of 
huge 
financial benefit to us, but 
I just can’t do it,” King said.
King voiced support for 

the ban, though she said 
she does not believe it will 
work in the way Whitmer 
intends.
“I 
don’t 
necessarily 
think that the flavoring 

part of it is necessarily 
something geared toward 
children 
or 
teenagers,” 
King said. “I think that 
it’s ‘a cool thing to do,’ and 
that’s why they’re doing 
it, but I don’t think the 
flavor thing is really the 
answer. I support people 
not 
smoking 
or 
vaping 
any type of tobacco, so if 
that’s going to keep people 
from using this, then yes, I 
support it.”
Whinery 
doesn’t 
believe 
the 
ban 
will 
work as intended either, 
because he doesn’t blame 
e-cigarette 
juice 
for 
the 
recent 
outbreak 
in 
vaping-related 
illnesses. 
He points to black market 
THC pods as an alternate 
cause.
Because of Ann Arbor’s 
ordinance preventing the 
sale of nicotine to those 
under 21, Whinery also 
said the flavored juice ban 
targets a type of consumer 

already 
prohibited 
from 
e-cigarette 
use 
in 
this 
part of the state. Whinery 
said he thinks removing 
flavored 
options 
merely 
inconveniences the adults 
looking 
for 
a 
cigarette 
alternative.
“There’s 
just 
a 
few 
years between 18 and 21, 
but mentally there’s a big 
difference, and I think the 
18-year-old kids probably 
do 
think 
more 
along 
the lines of flavors and 
‘yummy, this tastes good’ 
than maybe a 21-year-old, 
22-year-old 
who 
maybe 
smoked cigarettes for a few 
years and gave them up,” 
Whinery said.
Kolbusz is sympathetic 
to business owners, stating 
that though he supports 
the ban, he wishes there 
was a way for the small 
businesses 
to 
adjust 
without 
such 
abrupt 
change. However, he does 
not believe the 21 and 
over 
nicotine 
ordinance 
is 
enforced 
very 
often, 
leaving 
vape 
products 
available to any susceptible 
underage student.
In addition to posting 
about the ban in the Bongz 
and Thongz store windows, 
Whinery said he has been 
encouraging customers to 
contact state officials to 
renounce the ban.
“We’ve 
learned, 
as 
a 
business, 
that 
there 
is 
something that we can do,” 
Whinery said.
Ann Arbor smoke shop 
Red 13 posted a similar 
notice 
in 
their 
store, 
providing customers with 
a pre-generated email to 
send 
to 
the 
Governor’s 
office. Red 13 was unable 
to comment by the time of 
publication.
Nevertheless, 
Whinery 
said Bongz and Thongz 
plans to continue selling 
flavored e-cigarette juice 
until 
Whitmer’s 
ban 
is 
“stamped and signed and 
sealed.”

When I walked out of the 
Jackson 
Heights 
subway 

station in Queens, I could have 
been walking out of a metro 
station in Delhi or Mumbai 
or Chennai. Everyone around 
me was Brown, storefronts 
all around selling samosas, 

chaat and chai. It felt like 
home. It made me realize 
how empowering it is to be 
surrounded by people who 
look like you, something so 
many white people take for 

granted. Two of these photos 
show 
the 
predominantly 
South Asian area in Jackson 
Heights, Queens, New York; 
two of these photos are from 
the streets of Kochi, a city 

in my dad’s home state of 
Kerala in South India. To 
me, it is comforting how 
immigrant communities are 
able to recreate their homes 
wherever they settle. In the 

moment, sipping my chai and 
listening to all of the different 
languages 
being 
spoken 
around me, I was grateful to 
be there.

Street Life

There’s a space between space 
and time that you’ve managed to 
reside in. A grey area that should 

have slipped through the cracks. 
But, you’ve managed to maneuver 
adhesive 
after 
adhesive 
into 
what was once shattered. This 
space between space and time 
used to seem endless. Like the 
union of black hole to infinity. 

Like the consolidation of now 
and then. Like the reality of an 
unwanted death during life. The 
space between space and time 
was massive yet miniscule. And 
you managed to fit right in. I 
don’t believe in fairytales. I don’t 

believe in the idea of one soul 
being my required mate. But, I’ve 
seen the grey turn to light. I’ve 
seen you slip through the cracks 
to make the space between space 
and time seamlessly disappear. 
I’ve seen my soul turn soft, 

and felt my knees grow weak. 
I’ve seen my smile frame many 
millimeters, and I’ve felt my eyes 
rain. In your presence, the space 
between space and time is lost. 
In your presence, there has never 
been enough space and there will 

never be enough time. In this life, 
your soul has proved to latch onto 
mine. And in this space and time, 
I don’t mind mating with a soul so 
fine. I’d let you fill my space until 
the end of time, for I’ll always be 
yours and you’ll forever be mine.

First day of school for
people of color

I love to either completely 
match, or use colors of same 
palette. While I decided to 
choose an array of blues for 
my nails, I sadly forgot about 
my 
closet—I 
barely 
own 
anything blue. However, I 
found this spearmint striped 

shirt-dress 
hiding 
in 
my 
closet. Even better, I’ve never 
worn this dress, so what 
better way to start off my 
junior year than in a new fit!

Fashion is a way that any 
individual can express their 
culture on an everyday basis 
 
 
— and even more importantly, 
on the first day of school! This 
year MiC wanted to showcase 
the first day of school outfits 
of 
students 
of 
color 
who 
use their fashion to express 

their creativity and present 
themselves to the rest of the 
world. The students we are 
presenting have cultivated their 
style to truly express themselves 
as individuals. Please enjoy their 
fashion choices and the effort 
they put into expressing their 
identity in the form of fashion.

Fashion gives me the ability to 
put together a piece of artwork 
everyday when I wake up. I want 
to let people know through my 

fashion that you are not subjected 
to. a specific style and that 
you have the freedom to wear 
anything that sets your soul fire.

I chose this outfit for my 
first day of classes because 
the top is a vintage 1940s shirt 
in my favorite color. I want 
to get into more sustainable 
ways to shop for clothes this 
year 
and 
stop 
supporting 
fast fashion, especially when 
there are secondhand clothes 

that are this cute and unique! 
My Hello Kitty backpack is 
peeking out from the bottom 
left corner—it’s a purchase 
that I made because I’d like 
to think that Hello Kitty is 
not only a baddie, but also an 
iconic woman of color.

“

It was the best of times, it 
was the worst of times,” 
began Charles Dickens in 
his 1859 novel “A Tale of Two 
Cities.” Today, more than 150 years 
after Dickens’ death, those words 
remain relevant: At present, they 
describe the predicament facing 
Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Internationally, Putin’s reign has 
been a time of great success for 
Russia. Since first coming to power 
in 2000, he has emerged as the 
face of the modern Russian state, 
increased his nation’s power on the 
global stage and made significant 
strides towards Russia’s long-term 
goal of destabilizing Western, liberal 
democracies. However, while Putin 
continues to project strength abroad, 
he faces a spate of domestic concerns, 
with economic struggles and recent 
protests over electoral freedom 
causing his approval rating to drop as 
Russians begin to worry about their 
future. 
It is undeniable that through 
the lens of global geopolitics, Putin’s 
tenure as Russian president has been 
a time of great accomplishment for 
his nation. Today, Putin’s name and 
image are synonymous with the 
Russian state, a sign of his global 
political presence. He is consistently 
ranked alongside American and 
Chinese leaders as one of the world’s 
most powerful heads of state, despite 
governing a substantially smaller and 
less economically powerful nation 
than his Chinese and American 
counterparts. The sentiment that 
Putin is a strong leader is reflected in 
his global perception: As of 2018, 52 
percent of Americans believed Russia 
played a bigger role in the world than 
it had 10 years prior, while only 15 
percent thought it played a smaller 
role. 
However, Putin’s projections of 
strength are just the tip of the iceberg: 
On the world stage, he’s made tangible 
strides towards achieving Russia’s 
political goals. Russia’s primary goal 
is bigger than Putin: to destabilize 
Western nations it believes to be part 
of the liberal order. This aim extends 
back to the founding of the modern 
Russian state. After the Soviet Union 
fell, many former Soviet Republics 
and Soviet Union protectorates, 
which 
the 
Russians 
saw 
as 
culturally Russian, joined Western 
organizations such as the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization and 
the European Union, manifestations 
of the U.S.-backed liberal order. As 
the Russian president, weakening 
the liberal West is naturally a goal 
Putin has worked to further. His 

most-publicized triumph came in the 
2016 U.S. presidential election, when 
Russia’s government-backed online 
trolling group, the Internet Research 
Agency, helped sow political discord 
and promote President Donald 
Trump’s candidacy, which ultimately 
aided his victory. However, Putin’s 
accomplishments extend far beyond 
causing chaos in the 2016 presidential 
election: there are ties between 
Russia and the United Kingdom’s 
“Vote Leave” campaign from the 
2016 Brexit referendum, and many of 
Europe’s newly-empowered far-right 
parties, which share Putin’s disdain 
for liberalism, have ties to Russia. 
While 
Russia’s 
government-
sponsored electoral meddling has 
been highly effective, perhaps its 
most significant contribution is 
the blueprint it left behind. Across 
the globe, online political trolling 
has become a common electoral 
tactic. Though the aforementioned 
European far-right does maintain 
ties to Russia, many parties can 
now rely on a steady stream of 
inflammatory misinformation from 
far-right websites in their respective 
countries, a move inspired by the 
IRA’s tactics. Meanwhile, in other 
countries such as the Philippines, 
spreading 
misinformation 
has 
blossomed into a major component 
of 
political 
campaigning, 
with 
independent 
companies 
offering 
their online trolling services to 
candidates.
In 
addition 
to 
promoting 
democratic destabilization in the 
West, Putin has also worked to 
effectively expand Russia’s influence 
in Africa. Documents leaked earlier 
this year showed the Russian 
government’s plans to build ties with 
various African nations, including 
the Central African Republic, Libya 
and Madagascar, with the aim of 
introducing Russia-friendly leaders, 
promoting Russian political values, 
accessing natural resource deposits 
and securing lucrative military 
contracts. By competing with foreign 
nations (namely China and the 
United States) for influence in Africa, 
Putin aims to strengthen Russia’s 
influence abroad to a degree which 
has not been seen since the fall of the 
Soviet Union. With regard to Russian 
values, the documents revealed 
the Russian government’s interest 
in creating a sense of Pan-African 
nationalism among the countries it 
worked with in Africa, something 
which bears many similarities to the 
idea of the “Russky Mir” (Russian 
World), the ideology Russia uses to 
justify encroaching on the rights of 

former Soviet states like Belarus 
and Ukraine. Although Russia 
cannot match the massive financial 
investments the United States and 
China have made in Africa, they still 
demonstrate Putin’s vision of Russia 
as a global power capable of molding 
the world in its vision. 
However, 
despite 
Putin’s 
success in expanding Russian 
influence abroad, he faces several 
problems in his home country 
that may be of serious concern. 
Putin’s biggest obstacle is Russia’s 
struggling economy and its impact 
on everyday citizens — over the 
past five years, the average real 
income in Russia has dropped by 
over 10 percent, and Russians are 
understandably frustrated. Russia’s 
economic struggles, including the 
decreasing real income, can be 
traced back to two primary causes, 
both of which Putin bears some 
responsibility for. Most directly, at 
least some of Russia’s contemporary 
problems are tied to sanctions placed 
on Russia for annexation of Crimea, 
a move Putin had direct control over 
(ironically, the original invasion 
boosted Putin’s popularity). More 
importantly, Russia’s key economic 
problem in the past decade has 
been falling oil revenues. Though 
Putin 
cannot 
singlehandedly 
control the global prices of oil, 
many of Russia’s oil problems 
are linked to the government’s 
inability to diversify the Russian 
economy beyond natural resource 
production, something which stems 
from Putin’s disinterest in tackling 
economic corruption (though that 
is unsurprising, considering Putin is 
a personal beneficiary of the current 
system). 
While Putin’s most pressing 
domestic concern is the economy, 
Russian citizens have also grown 
frustrated with some of Putin’s 
repressive political tactics and are 
coming out in protest. Earlier this 
year, investigative journalist Ivan 
Golunov was held in jail on fabricated 
drug charges after he investigated 
corruption in the Russian funeral 
industry. However, after protests 
across the nation, the government 
ultimately admitted defeat and 
released Golunov. In recent weeks, 
a spate of protests have been held in 
Moscow after Putin’s government 
disqualified several rival candidates 
running for city council positions.

Putin’s international success and domestic struggle

C 

ollege students ought 
to be interested in the 
recent inversion of the 
yield curve, as its ramifications 
could 
potentially 
pose 
a 
significant threat to our post-
graduation plans.
For those who don’t know 
what the yield curve is, it is 
a graph that plots different 
bonds by their contract length 
and their respective yields, or 
how much one gets back for 
investment. Typically, 10-year 
bonds 
have 
higher 
yields 
because that means people are 
lending out their money for a 
longer period of time and thus 
should expect a greater return 
on their investment. However, 
for the first time since 2006, the 
yield curve recently “inverted,” 
meaning that short term yields 
increased above long term ones.
Why is this such a big deal? 
Bonds are generally a much 
better measure of the economy’s 
health 
than 
other 
markers, 
such as stocks, for a couple 
reasons. First and foremost, the 
variability of the stock market 
is pretty much unpredictable. 
When it is up or down, people 
will offer their thoughts on what 
has influenced it as a whole, but 
typically the day-to-day just 
sometimes changes. Bonds are 
like stocks but are generally 
considered safer due to their 
complexity 
and 
guaranteed 
returns. As business journalist 
Heidi 
Moore 
eloquently 
explained in a tweet thread: 
“The stock market is a way that 
people tell short stories about 
a company … Bonds also tell a 
story about a company or a 
government. But it’s a BETTER 
story, a novel rather than a short 
story.”
The inverted yield curve is a 
better indicator of the economy’s 
health than any given down turn 
in the stock market. As short-
term bonds have increasingly 
higher yields than long-term 
ones, investors are essentially 

saying that the short run is 
looking riskier than the long 
run, and therefore yields should 
be higher in order to compensate 
for the higher risk (i.e., there is 
most likely a recession landing 
in about two years’ time).
That may seem like a whole 
lot of economic jargon, but 
in reality, the track record 
for inverted yield curves and 
recessions in the U.S. and United 
Kingdom is rather uncanny. All 
of the recessions in post-war 
America have been preceded 
by an inversion in the yield 
curve about two years prior. 
That is cause enough for serious 
concern.
Truthfully, it is incredibly 
difficult to discern the exact 
cause of this phenomenon. All 
we can do is infer plausible 
causes and make judgments on 
them on a case-by-case basis. 
What we do know is that the 
temporary 
inversion 
in 
the 
yield curve means that there 
is some sort of short-term 
uncertainty 
in 
the 
market. 
Most likely, it is a combination 
of factors all impacting the 
market. Global growth is down: 
Germany is nearing a recession 
with a shrinking economy and 
Argentina’s stock market lost 
about half its value in a few 
days. Pair this with the ongoing 
trade 
tensions 
between 
the 
U.S. and China and a looming 
disaster brewing in the United 
Kingdom. due to the possibility 
of a “No-Deal” Brexit, and it all 
points to a murky short-term 
future for the global market.
It is also somewhat possible 
that there is a self-fulfilling 
aspect of this warning. After all, 
the inverted yield curve does 
not cause a recession; it merely 
acts as a historic signifier of one. 
Warnings of a looming downturn 
could influence stakeholders to 
respond accordingly by saving 
more and spending less, which 
in turn slows the economy and 
thus we have the very thing we 

feared would happen anyway. 
It should be noted that while 
this inversion has occurred 
before every recession, the 
sample size for this indicator 
is 
still 
rather 
small. 
The 
outcome is not guaranteed, 
but it is reasonably probable — 
we ought to take the warning 
seriously all the same. 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
has 
tried 
diverting 
much 
of the attention away from 
the warning signs, tweeting 
recently that “the Democrats 
are trying to ‘will’ the economy 
to be bad for purposes of the 
2020 elections” while also 
attacking the Federal Reserve 
for not keeping interest rates 
lower. 
Unfortunately, 
there 
is no evidence that the Fed’s 
interest rates have much to do 
with this phenomenon, and it is 
unlikely the Democratic party 
possesses the will to impact 
global markets in such a way.
Regardless of possible causes, 
everyone attending a university 
should be paying close attention 
over the next year or so. Great 
resources include keeping up 
with news sources such as The 
Economist, The Wall Street 
Journal or the Financial Times 
that all cover the economy in 
detail (and all have some sort 
of student discount available). 
Another tool to stay educated 
is social media. Find and follow 
a few economists to stay up to 
date.
If the inversion of the yield 
curve is correct again that 
means a recession is just two 
short years away. Which, by 
my math, means it will hit as 
most of us currently attending 
the University of Michigan are 
graduating. Securing a job can 
be hard enough after getting 
your diploma. Let’s hope we 
don’t have to do that in the 
midst of a new recession too.

On mental health and mass shootings

TIMOTHY SPURLIN | COLUMN

“

Mental illness and hate pulls 
the trigger, not the gun,” said 
President Donald Trump at 
a White House address following 
the back-to-back shootings in El 
Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio 
in early August. Trump’s words 
echo a greater sentiment put forth 
by a multitude of politicians and 
gun rights advocates in the days 
following mass shootings. 
In the wake of the mass 
shootings that have plagued the 
United States for the better part 
of two decades, elected officials 
and various public figures have 
often steered the debate away from 
gun control toward mental illness 
issues within the country. Perhaps, 
at first, this seems to make sense. 
To many Americans, the thought 
of entering a public space with 
high powered weapons for the 
sole purpose of killing innocent 
strangers 
is 
incomprehensible. 
A sensible conclusion seems to 
be that no individual of a sound 
mind would do such a thing, and 
therefore such a perpetrator must 
have some sort of mental illness. 
However, 
the 
majority 
of 
research demonstrates that the 
propensity to make a connection 
between mass gun violence and 
mental illness is misguided. Though 
some high-profile mass shooters, 
such as those who committed the 
massacres at Virginia Tech, in 
Tucson, Ariz. and in Newtown, 
Conn., had a history of mental 
illness, evidence demonstrates this 
relationship is not causal. 
The first piece of evidence to 
disprove the relationship between 
mental illness and mass gun 
violence is that the United States 
is not unique in terms of rates 
of mental health issues. In fact, 
statistics show rates of mental 
illness remain roughly the same 
throughout 
the 
world. 
When 
compared with peer nations such 
as Canada, Ireland or Germany, 
the United States demonstrates 
similar rates of mental illness. If 
mental illness was truly the main 
cause of these random acts of 
mass violence, then the rates of 
mass shootings in these countries 
should be comparable to those in 
the United States. However, when 
it comes to gun violence, the United 
States stands alone among its peers. 
As of 2017, gun-related deaths 
comprise 73 percent of homicides in 

the United States, compared with 3 
percent in England and Wales as 
of 2017, 38 percent in Canada as of 
2018 and 13 percent in Australia as 
of 2013. In fact, gun homicides in 
the U.S. are at a 25.2 times higher 
rate than gun homicides in other 
comparable 
developed 
nations. 
Additionally, the United States 
ranks as the 28th highest in terms 
of rates of deaths from gun violence 
worldwide, far higher than other 
developed countries. While the 
mental illness epidemic appears 
to be universal, the gun violence 
epidemic 
remains 
uniquely 
American. 

Another counterpoint to the 
notion of mental illness as a 
cause of mass shootings or gun 
violence is the fact that mentally 
ill individuals, in reality, commit 
a small fraction of overall violent 
crimes. Data from the National 
Center 
for 
Health 
Statistics 
shows that less than 5 percent of 
violent crimes are committed by 
those with diagnosable mental 
illnesses. 
Thus, 
those 
with 
mental health issues are overall 
unlikely 
to 
perpetrate 
violent 
crimes, including gun violence 
and mass shootings. Moreover, 
further 
statistics 
demonstrate 
that mentally ill individuals are, 
in fact, much more likely to be the 
victims of violent crimes. More 
than 25 percent of those diagnosed 
with a mental illness will be the 
victim of a violent crime. It seems 
that the existence of a mental 
illness is a far better predictor of 
victimization of violence rather 
than of perpetration. 
At this point, it is clear that a 
mental illness does not make an 
individual more likely to harm 
others in acts of gun violence. 
However, there is another link 
between 
mental 
illness 
and 
gun violence that often remains 

undiscussed. Suicides have long 
accounted for the majority of 
gun-related deaths in the United 
States. Suicide by firearm is also 
an extremely brutal method, 
accounting for less than 6 percent 
of suicide attempts but over half 
of fatalities. Furthermore, ease 
of access to guns contributes to 
suicide risk. People living in states 
with high rates of household gun 
ownership are four times as likely 
to die by gun-related suicide when 
compared to states with lower 
rates of household gun ownership. 
In this sense, there appears to be 
a link between gun violence and 
mental health struggles. However, 
access to firearms proves to be 
a greater risk to the mentally ill 
themselves rather than to the rest 
of society as a whole. 
In the wake of mass shootings 
that continually rattle the United 
States, 
politicians 
repeatedly 
blame the mental health crisis 
for the carnage. This is an issue 
that persists on both sides of 
the ideological spectrum, with 
Trump blaming the mentally ill for 
pulling the trigger and Democratic 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo 
calling for a “mental health data 
base to prevent the dangerously 
mentally ill from purchasing a 
firearm.” 
Repeatedly 
placing 
the blame for our gun violence 
crisis on the nation’s mentally 
ill, an already vulnerable and 
stigmatized population, is unfair 
and dangerous. The fact of the 
matter is that both mental illness 
and gun violence are massive 
public health epidemics inflicting 
untold damage on the American 
populace. 
Even 
though 
the 
brazen 
capacity for violence demonstrated 
in high profile mass shootings 
seems far outside the bounds of 
sanity to most people, mental 
illness is decidedly not responsible 
for the high rates of gun violence 
in the United States (barring those 
related to suicide). In order to 
properly provide for our nation’s 
mentally ill, we must dispel 
harmful stereotypes that mental 
health issues are responsible for 
one of our worst national scourges 
and begin to look elsewhere to 
combat our gun violence epidemic.

In the spirit of Welcome Week, 
Festifall and all things post-Labor-Day, 
The Daily Film section has written a 
collection of blurbs celebrating our 
favorite “Openings” to movies. Here’s 
to another year of learning, changing, 
trying, 
failing, 
crying, 
smiling, 
passing, movie-watching and (most 
importantly) a-best-picture-awarded-
to-a-film-that-surpasses-the-low-
bar-of-not-being-problematic-at-best-
and-severly-discouraging-as-to-the-

“If Beale Street Could Talk”
Barry 
Jenkins’s 
(“Moonlight”) 
opening scene in “If Beale Street 
Could Talk” technically lasts just 
three minutes. The leading pair, 
Alonzo 
“Fonny” 
Hunt 
(Stephan 
James, “Race”) and Tish Rivers (KiKi 
Layne, “Native Son”) step into the 
frame 
hand-in-hand, 
invigorating 
Baldwin’s quoted words — they stroll 
down a quiet sidewalk and kiss before 
the movie cuts to a more current scene 
of Tish visiting Fonny in jail. For the 
purposes of this blurb, I am only 
concerned with 40 seconds of this 
sequence, which are entirely spent 
tracking their walk. Point A to Point 

B. That’s all.
Is it, though? Not if you play along 
with Jenkins, look where he wants 
you to look, play along with his tricks 
just long enough to fall under his spell. 
The camera arcs around the lovers, 
starting behind and slightly above 
Fonny and Tish, so at first, what stands 
out is the perfect synchrony of their 
steps like we are watching a ballet. 
As we watch from a steepening angle, 
however, we see this choreography 
is imperfect: Fonny’s intoed gait is 
not an absolute counterpart to Tish’s. 
As the camera begins its descent, 
we see their clumsy upper bodies 
hazarding into each other, in spite of 
the synchronization of their feet. 
Poise and clumsiness. Plans and 
inevitability. Jenkins’s lightly but 
not over-choreographed simplicity 
to mimic romance’s. Like waiting in 
your car for 10 minutes so you ring 
the doorbell reasonably late. Like 
“running into them” as they exit one 
classroom as you enter your next. 
Like matching a stride, slowing or 
quickening to keep up with the person 
you love.

“No Strings Attached”
The first week of classes is over, 
“sylly week” if you will, and the only 
real way to mourn the end of Welcome 
Week parties is to watch the beginning 
of “No Strings Attached” several times 

over. The opening of the film moves 
quickly from the characters’ first 
meeting as young teens at camp to an 
awkward encounter at a frat party. 
While a wide shot of a frat house is 
no cinematographic feat, the beauty 
of the scene lies in the set design. 
Block M flags hang out the windows 
of the house and there’s a slow 
realization that Ashton Kutcher and 
Natalie Portman, at one point in their 
lives, were just like us. Or, at least, 
pretended to be. The shot continues 
and soon, you’re reliving freshman 
year — except it’s not Greta Gerwig 
shouting about how drunk she is but 
one of your new dorm friends you 
have to grab from an elevated surface. 
And 
there’s 
something 
special 
about 
watching 
Ashton 
Kutcher 
pretending to be a “brother” while 
surrounded with various university 
paraphernalia. 
He 
embodies 
the 
fraternity aesthetic and his confused 
recognition as he spots Portman 
from across the room is a look all 
too familiar from Welcome Week 
shenanigans. 
So, as the school year starts and 
schedules fill up, anytime you’re 
feeling down, just remember that 
Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman, 
or at least their characters, also once 
awkwardly tried to remember why 
someone seemed so familiar during 
the school year.

Whether 
you 
call 
it 
trip-hop, 
“downtempo” or “lounge,” the type 
of music that falls under this large 
umbrella of related genres is incredibly 
difficult to pull off without sounding 
unbearably corny, boring or both. 
Successes do exist, from Portishead to 
Massive Attack as well as some work by 
groups such as Zero 7, but as a whole, 
and for good reason, there’s not much 
out there that excites and intrigues 
more than it cures insomnia.
I heard Moon Safari described 
using some of these terms, and while 
not wrong per se, I discovered how 
meaningless they really were. The 
1998 debut album of the French duo 
consisting 
of 
two 
students 
from 
Versailles, Nicolas Godin and Jean-
Benoît Dunkel, is perhaps one of the 
most playful and, dare I say, cheeky 
albums you will ever hear. Borne out of 
endless tinkering and experimenting 
with synths, preceded by remixes and 
a middling EP, Moon Safari is itself an 
odd experiment, a mish-mash of genres 
and time periods.
At times sophisticated and at others 
melancholic yet strangely childish, the 
album still sounds futuristic in the 
same way a Lamborghini Countach 
still 
looks 
futuristic. 
Both 
didn’t 
necessarily predict the predominant 
aesthetics of the future, but perhaps we 
just haven’t really caught up.
And like the Countach, Moon Safari 
is both breathtaking and prone to fall 
apart at any moment. The fact that 
Moon Safari never reaches the heights 
it’s capable of makes it that much more 
fascinating. These heights, however, 
are teased at in the memorable opener, 
the instrumental “La Femme d’argent.” 
Anchored by a lovely, fun bassline, 
it nonetheless makes me feel like it 
should be the soundtrack to an awful 
B-movie, or at best (worst?) Roger 

Moore dumping around in space as 
James Bond in “Moonraker.”
“Sexy Boy,” the following track, is 
the prime example of how the duo, like 
Giorgio Moroder in Italy decades prior, 
transformed overwhelming corniness 
into something that is somehow cool. 
The vocoder-based vocals, whispering 
in French during the verses and 
letting out protracted versions of the 
title during the chorus aren’t quite 
D’Angelo’s croons, but the charging 
drumtrack 
and 
wobbling 
synth 
patterns make the track surprisingly 
addicting and captivating.
“All I Need,” featuring Tampa-
based singer Beth Hirsch is the most 
“lounge”-y track on the album, but 
the bassline and intermittent synth 
flourishes elevate it above most made-
for-Lifetime-commercial tracks that 
permeate the genre. “Ce matin-là,” 
another instrumental, is similar in that 
it is just too damn pretty for its own 
good, but self-aware all the same.
Air achieved some popular success 
after the release of Moon Safari, scoring 
Sofia Coppola’s “The Virgin Suicides” 
and contributing to her later film “Lost 
in Translation” as well. Like those 
films, Air’s music ended up capturing 
the late ’90s and early 2000s too well in 
a sense. In Air’s case, they were never 
able to recreate the purity ever-present 
in Moon Safari, and considering the 
events in the world in the following 
years continuing up to now, I suppose 
that makes sense.
The 
sense 
of 
self-awareness 
permeates the entire album and is the 
reason why it eclipses many of the 
works that followed it up in the early 
2000s. “Sexy Boy” isn’t in anyway 
supposed to be sexy, for example, yet 
there’s an undeniable confidence and 
swagger underneath all that cheese. 
This is not an album for the irony-
poisoned and cynical (as I personally 
found myself drifting towards when I 
first listened to it). To me, it was more 
of a reminder that I needed to get over 
myself and, well, have some fun.

FILM NOTEBOOK

JULIANNA MORANO
Daily Arts Writer

Last 
week, 
Kanye 
West 
officially announced the tracklist 
and release date for Jesus Is King, 
his upcoming ninth studio album. 
It’s common knowledge now that 
album 
rollout 
announcements 
from Kanye should be taken with 
a grain of salt. We’ve seen this 
happen for years, most memorably 
the 
haphazard 
yet 
wholesome 
rollout of The Life Of Pablo, in 
which the tracklist was finalized 
weeks after the initial release.
The most recent unorthodox 
album rollout came in fall 2018 as 
Kanye teased Yandhi, a spiritual 
successor of sorts to his 2013 
album Yeezus. It was originally 
slated for Sept. 29, then delayed to 
Nov. 23, but 2019 came around and 
Yandhi never did.
Some 
time 
in 
mid-August, 
several leaked versions of Yandhi 
began circulating — in particular, 
a 28-minute leak on YouTube 
that compiled nine demos and 
recordings, 
presumably 
from 
sessions for Yandhi. Since then, 
the 
title 
has 
become 
fairly 
synonymous with this collection 
of leaks.
There’s a lot of debate about the 
ethics of leaks. Some argue they 
are harmful and can cost artists 
or labels financially, or cause 
artists to throw away tracks that 
had potential. But after a song (or 
album) has been leaked, there’s no 
going back. Yandhi is an especially 
interesting leak: It’s very much a 
rough draft. Most of the songs are 
unfinished, embodying a certain 
idea Kanye was reaching for but 
not quite realized. I took this 
opportunity to dig into the brief 
tracklisting for Yandhi for insight 
into Kanye’s creation process and 
ask a question: What could have 
been?
The opening track, “New Body,” 
is a pop-rap song with appearances 
from frequent collaborators Ty 
Dolla $ign and Nicki Minaj. The 

lyrics celebrate plastic surgery, 
something relevant to Nicki Minaj 
herself and Kanye West’s current 
(and 
past) 
partner. 
A 
catchy 
flute melody plays throughout, 
a 
vaguely 
African 
pop 
sound 
maybe inspired by Kanye’s 2018 
trip to record in Uganda. The 
instrumental is pretty middling, 
though.
Next is “The Storm,” featuring 
the late XXXTentacion in a mildly 
awkward and angry verse. The 
aggression in the verse comes 
off especially strange because 
the vocals are unmixed, so he 
just sounds like he’s pissed off, 
screaming over a Skype call or 
something. The song is repetitive 
and 
uninteresting. 
So 
far, 
it 
seemed fair for Yandhi to hit the 
bin.
“Alien” is the first song to show 
potential. As the title suggests, 
it features a surreal and colorful 
beat with an eerie melody. At one 
point the instrumental really kicks 
in and starts to envelop your ears 
like a grandiose movie soundtrack. 
The song ends abruptly though 
and Kanye’s delivery is pathetic — 
they are clearly first-time laid-out 
lyrics. If the track were finished 
with 
a 
better 
performance 
from Kanye, “Alien” could be a 
highlight track on a future Kanye 
West project.
“Law of Attraction” (also called 
“Chakras”) is probably the most 
obvious demo on the album, as 
similar to the previous track, 
Kanye mumbles nonsensical lyrics 
to get his flow down throughout. 
It seems to be a pattern for Kanye 
in his songwriting process that the 
flows and emotions and concepts 
come before any finished lyrics. 
The 
layered 
vocal 
harmonies 
are wonderful, and there’s an 
intensity 
to 
Kanye’s 
delivery 
that could make for a respectable 
album deep cut, but the next track, 
“Bye Bye Baby,” fulfills the same 
role on an album. It’s similar in 
intensity with a more interesting 
instrumental 
and 
features 
a 
very emotional (and completed) 

Kanye-core verse, touching on his 
feelings of insecurity that have 
shined on his last few records.
Only one track, “Hurricane,” is a 
really unlistenable demo. The beat 
is pretty cool and glamorous — it 
sounds like something you might 
find on a Travis Scott project — 
but the weird falsetto vocals are 
horrifyingly annoying. The song 
won’t be missed. It’s followed by 
“We Got Love (Remix),” another 
high 
potential 
track. 
That’s 
rumored to have originally been 
for Teyana Taylor’s album, which 
would explain why her verse is so 
well put together beside Kanye 
West’s awkward and vaguely off-
beat contributions.
“Garden” is a beautiful and 
soulful 
track 
that 
presumably 
came from a session with the choir 
for Kanye West’s “Sunday Service” 
performances — weekly, invite-
only stagings in which Kanye West 
performs gospel-esque versions of 
music from his catalog. It sounds 
like an even better version of 
something you might find on 
Chance 
the 
Rapper’s 
Coloring 
Book. The audio is notably low-
quality, like it was recorded on a 
cell phone during a live session. 
This is a track to be excited 
about: It’s one of the only leaked 
songs to appear on the tracklist 
posted for Jesus Is King, so we 
can (cautiously) expect a finished 
release in the near future. The 
leaked album closes with “Slave 
Name,” a gorgeous instrumental 
outro led by a guitar, but clearly 
incomplete.
The 
verdict? 
Yandhi 
has 
potential. We’ll probably never 
see finished versions of “Alien” or 
“Bye Bye Baby,” something that’s 
actually deeply unfortunate. The 
ideas and concepts on Yandhi 
are 
actually 
extremely 
fresh 
and exciting. The insight into 
Kanye West’s creative process is 
interesting, but unfinished demos 
aren’t really revisitable. The best 
fans can do is wait and hope that 
Jesus Is King embraces the best of 
Yandhi — if it even comes out.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

DYLAN YONO
Daily Arts Writer

Part 
of 
going 
to 
an 
elite 
university is sometimes there’s an 
overwhelming pressure to always 
be busy. During time off from 
rigorous 
academic 
schedules, 
many feel that they should be 
doing 
something 
exciting 
and 
career-enhancing. 
I 
stressed 
myself out all second semester 
looking for internships and jobs to 
keep myself occupied this summer. 
To my dismay, every single plan 
I made fell through. Even the 
class I was going to take at the 
community college back home was 
canceled. I left Ann Arbor feeling 
defeated, boredom already seeping 
in. But I didn’t stay bored for 
long. A couple internships worked 
out, I secured a job, I took online 
classes. Suddenly, my summer was 
full of fulfilling experiences.
My most adventurous endeavor 
was going to Los Angeles for a 
month-long film internship. I lived 
on my own for a month in a city 
I’d never been to without knowing 
a soul — a seven-hour plane ride 
from my home. I worked a nine-to-
five internship at a film company 
and loved (almost) every second 
of it. I explored career options 
I didn’t even know existed. I 
fulfilled dreams, I expanded my 
resume, but mostly I learned how 
strong I was.
When I came back, I nannied a 
two-and-a-half-year-old 
toddler, 
getting a different taste of adult 
responsibilities. As I was making 
sure she didn’t run into the road 
or fall down the stairs, I found the 
old saying that babysitting is the 
best birth control to be true in as 
many ways as it is false.
I even explored my local theatre, 
doing an internship that allowed 
me to learn the stories of people 
in my community. I reconnected 
with the home I found last summer 
before making Ann Arbor my home. 
I found a passion for hearing and 
sharing other people’s stories.
All these experiences proved 
to be hard work, but incredibly 
fulfilling. I grew in so many ways 
that I barely recognized myself. 
Away from the tight schedules 
and academic pressures of the 
school year, summer is the time 

when we finally have a chance to 
explore who we are and who we 
want to be. A lot of that comes 
from the new opportunities we are 
allowed to explore, such as jobs, 
internships and volunteer work. 
But a lot also comes from having 
some time to ourselves to indulge 
in our passions and give ourselves 
time to expand our minds on our 
own terms.
In the weeks between jobs, I 
found myself growing more and 
more comfortable having time to 
myself, with a lot of my summer 
spent curled on on my bed typing 
aggressively 
on 
my 
laptop 
or 
quietly strumming my g uitar. I 
finally had the freedom to do all 
the projects I always wanted to do 
but was too busy to actually do. At 
first, it was a lot of pressure. But 
eventually, I settled into starting 
projects 
for 
myself 
and 
not 
worrying about having to finish 
them for a deadline. That led to a 
lot of unfinished projects, but also 
a lot of new and exciting ideas.
I wrote a synopsis for about 
seven different plays I wanted 
to write and didn’t finish any of 
them. I watched documentaries. 
I learned how to do a mediocre 
Scottish accent for no reason 
other than I thought it would be 
a fun skill to have. I discovered 
new music (thanks Ben Platt for 
the title). I gave my Instagram 
an aesthetic, I painted, I wrote, 
I cooked. I slept in until noon 
and 
watched 
all 
of 
“Arrested 
Development” in one week. I lived 
in my own skin and began to enjoy 
having time to myself for the first 
time in a long time.
Growth isn’t only about keeping 
busy 
and 
having 
the 
coolest 
summer story. As high achieving 
students, sometimes we feel that if 
we’re not doing the best internship 
out there, we aren’t doing enough. 
But having a balance of these 
things is how we grow into who 
we are meant to be. We need days 
where we work nine to five at a 
dream internship and days when 
we sleep until noon and write 
crappy plays, or even just binge 
Netf lix. Growth is a process, and 
all forms of creativity add to it. 
My summer may be over, but the 
growth from it will continue on 
throughout the school year and 
beyond.

On growing as I go, &
loving the in-between

For years, Harvey Weinstein’s powerful 
career allowed him to domineer over 
Hollywood without repercussions, but in 
“Untouchable,” director Ursula Macfarlane 
(“One Deadly Weekend 
in 
America”) 
helps 
victims of his abuse 
speak 
their 
truths 
through 
interviews 
and archived material. 
With no introduction 
to the crimes Weinstein 
committed, 
the 
documentary 
dives 
immediately into Erika 
Rosenbaum’s story and 
her experience as a 
young actress who was 
assaulted by Weinstein after meeting him at in 
Hollywood.
From there, “Untouchable” jumps in 
between victims’ testimonials to try and 
capture the essence of Weinstein’s grotesque 
abuse of power during his time with Miramax, 
a film production company. In several different 
ways, the documentary makes clear that if 
Weinstein hadn’t had the ability to sweep his 
actions under the rug with such ease — which 
consisted of carefully detailed non-disclosure 
agreements (NDAs) and cash settlements — 
there would have been more than enough 
evidence to prove that he was the culprit of 
these crimes.
Zelda Perkins, Weinstein’s former assistant, 

provides several details on this matter and 
delves deeper into Weinstein’s temperament 
as well. She admits that she originally didn’t 
take his words and actions very seriously, 
and often warned others that “he will behave 
inappropriately” but reassuring them that if 
they dealt with him “robustly,” then it would be 
fine. That is, until another one of Weinstein’s 
assistants divulged the story of her assault at 

the hands of Weinstein. Perkins resigned, but 
Weinstein grew anxious, leaving around 18 
voicemails asking her to meet him. When she 
eventually signed an NDA, Weinstein’s team 
made sure to cover all bases, adding to the 
contract that if they went to court over the 
matter, Perkins was contractually obligated to 
try and keep Miramax in good standing.
Several NDAs were signed, but rumors 
started to spread throughout the industry. 
Many had heard and believed that actresses 
were having sex with Weinstein to get better 
roles, and had consequently turned a blind eye 
to the matter. At the time, and probably to this 
day, the film industry holds its demons away 
from the public eye. In Weinstein’s hayday, he 

was, essentially, untouchable.
Andrew Goldman, a reporter, recalls an 
instance where he caught Weinstein speaking 
indecently on his recorder. Weinstein grew 
quickly agitated, and tried to snatch the 
recorder out of his hand. Weinstein smashed 
Goldman over his head multiple times, and 
Goldman distinctly remembers seeing other 
reporters taking pictures of the incident. But 
none of them ever surfaced 
in the media. It goes to show 
how Weinstein and his team 
ultimately controlled what 
the public thought of him 
at the time, and despite the 
times he could have been 
exposed, 
maintained 
a 
relatively clean reputation 
for far too long.
In 
terms 
of 
the 
documentary 
itself, 
at 
times the theatrics were 
dramatic to a fault, and 
slightly distracting for the graveness of the 
story. The stories themselves were harrowing 
enough, the documentary could have done 
with a little less dramatic sound effects and 
B-roll. Nevertheless, this was a story that 
had to be told, and despite its medium, the 
world has taken a step toward justice with 
documentaries that seek to expose the truth. 
It’s absolutely unacceptable that Weinstein 
escaped accountability for so long, and still has 
not faced the full consequences of his actions. 
The only upside to his offenses is that we know 
now that no matter how long it takes, the truth 
will always come out, and we won’t stop until 
those truths are acknowledged and actions are 
taken.

When 
it 
comes 
to 
performing, 
Christian French pays attention to 
the details. Upon entering the Blind 
Pig, a large crescent moon illuminated 
the stage. It was a centerpiece for his 
tour, named after his newly released 
EP, bright side of the moon. Ann Arbor 
was the first stop, and eager students 
packed up against the walls of The 
Blind Pig in anticipation of the opening 
performance. They repeatedly chanted 
the singer’s name in the moments 
leading up to his entrance and erupted 
into cheers as he ran on stage sporting 
a University of Michigan jersey given 
to him by a fan. French opened with 
his 2018 single, “superstars,” a love 
song about enjoying the glory of youth, 
a common theme in not just his music 
but also the tour as a whole. 
French kept the energy up at full 
throttle, jumping into one song after the 
next and constantly encouraging the 
crowd to sing along with their hands in 
the air. He had a presence that engaged 
with every part of the audience as he 
migrated to different parts of the stage 
and even performing at the very edge, 
as if he wanted to get as close to his fans 
as possible. This kind of genuine spirit 
could be felt palpably by the crowd. As 
I looked around, everyone appeared 
captivated by French, eagerly waiting 
to see what he would do next. 
French’s ability to connect so well 
with 
the 
college 
crowd 
probably 
stemmed from the fact that he recently 
was just a college student himself. 
The 22-year-old singer was a pre-med 
student at the University of Indiana 
before deciding to drop out to pursue 
a career in music. And he’s no stranger 
to Michigan: The singer performed at 
The Blind Pig a little less than a year 
ago and opened for Quinn XCII at the 
Fillmore in downtown Detroit this past 
Winter. 
After playing a handful of songs from 
his older projects, including “Fall For 
You,” the first song he ever recorded, 
as well as a tune off his new EP titled 
“head first,” French paused to explain 
the story behind “Sweet Home.” French 
wrote the song about his experience 
moving from Indiana to California, 
and how daunting and exciting the 
transition was. He offered another 
pause before performing the heaviest 
song of the night titled “Dying Alive.” 
Behind his keyboard, French explained 
how he suffered from anxiety and 
destroyed the romantic relationship he 
was in because of it. 
Before playing “Time of Our Lives,” 
one of his unreleased songs, he politely 
asked the crowd to put their phones 
away and simply live in the moment. 
After all, he pointed out, “We are 
literally the only ones that get to 
experience this.” The timing of this 
request couldn’t have been more perfect 

— “Time of Our Lives” is all about being 
present and enjoying every moment we 
have, and the crowd cheerfully swayed 
along to the music, seemingly content 
without their mobile distractions. 
French wrapped up the show with 
“bright side of the moon,” the album’s 
title track, which captures the album’s 
focus on seeking positivity even when 
the rest of the world seems to be 

tossing around negative thoughts. He 
then returned his University jersey 
to its rightful owner in the front row, 
which revealed the other University 
jersey he was wearing underneath with 
“French” printed on the back. He ended 
with his hit song “love ride” before 
running off stage.
But the crowd wasn’t done with him 
yet. Cheers for one more song pulsated 
throughout the venue, and French 
reappeared to perform one last and 
arguably his most popular song, “By 
Myself.” After the show, French offered 
a meet and greet with fans, just another 
example of how he wants to invest in his 
fan base and give them an experience 
they will always remember. As an artist 
still trying to make their way into the 
big leagues of music, Christian French 
has the tools he needs to reach new 
fan bases and build a successful music 
career. French delivered a seamless 
opener, and there’s no doubt he will 
continue to impress audiences as he 
takes on the rest of his fall tour. 

On Christian French’s
youthful enthusiasm

CONCERT REVIEW

French kept the 
energy up at full 
throttle, jumping into 
one song after the 
next and constantly 
encouraging the 
crowd to sing along 
with their hands in 
the air

The first show I saw on Friday 
was the worst show I saw on Friday. 
I don’t want to hate on Conan Gray, 
because he seems like a nice guy 
who loves his fans, and performing 
at Lollapalooza clearly meant a lot to 
him. However, his music is not very 
good: His particular angsty brand 
of synthpop is so unoriginal that it 
defies specific description, and he 
doesn’t even have that much of it. 
Gray was allotted an hour, and after 
performing every song he has ever 
released, he finished his set with 
fifteen minutes to spare. In the end, it 
was an uninspiring performance. 
Luckily, up next was Japanese 
Breakfast, the solo project of Michelle 
Zauner, an act who could hopefully 
right the wrongs of the previous set. 
Tito’s, the stage upon which Japanese 
Breakfast played, is the worst at the 
festival — there’s rarely sufficient 
space for the audience and those who 
aren’t far from the stage are forced to 
stand on concrete while baking in the 
afternoon sun. That said, the music 
of Japanese Breakfast could not 
have contrasted more sharply with 
the mood in this ill-favored setting. 
Japanese Breakfast put on perhaps 
the most relaxing set of the weekend, 
her groovy bedroom-pop the perfect 
antidote to the stultifying sea of 
concrete that engulfed me. Zauner’s 
voice is breathtaking live, soaring 
with clarity over reverb-laden guitar 
and fuzzy bass. Her guitarist is also 
quite talented, firing off a handful 
of roaring solos. Towards the end 
of the set, as a tribute to Chicago, 
she performed a touching cover of 
Wilco’s “Jesus, Etc.” It was an all-
around pleasant experience. 
Maggie Rogers may not make the 
most interesting pop music in the 

world (or have the keenest sense of 
melody), but it is impossible to dislike 
the artist herself. Rogers put her 
heart and soul into her performance, 
and it shone through. The crowd 
adored her; they were singing and 
dancing to every song, and even 
did their best to sing through the 
technical difficulties on “Alaska.” It 
was a delightful set, even if the songs 
themselves are not remarkable. 
Death Cab For Cutie put on an 
earnest and enjoyable performance, 
but their elegant music does not 
translate 
all 
that 
well 
to 
live 
shows. The desolation of “Title and 
Registration” and the creepy intensity 
of “I Will Possess Your Heart” seem 
not to carry through from their 
studio renditions. Strangely, the band 
only played one song from their most 
recent album, and the album they 
are ostensibly touring in support 
of, Thank You For Today. Granted, 
it wasn’t a very popular album, but 
neither was Kitsugi, which got more 

play time despite being four years old. 
Death Cab frontman Ben Gibbard 
claimed they originally were not 
going to play their most popular song, 
“I Will Follow You Into the Dark,” 
but changed their mind thanks to the 
request of “a prominent Chicagoan.” 
That Chicagoan, to the surprise of 
no one given his appearance earlier 
in the day at Calboy’s set, turned out 
to be none other than Chance the 
Rapper. He emerged from backstage 
to join the band in a performance of 
“Do You Remember,” a sentimental 
cut off of Chance’s new studio album, 
The Big Day, that features Gibbard 
on the hook. The performance was 
decent. They did not play a few of 
their live staples (“Transatlanticism,” 
“Grapevine 
Fires”) 
that 
were 
expected by many, likely due to time 
constraints.
There was no encore. While I 
enjoyed Death Cab For Cutie’s set in 
spite of some flaws, they were not the 
primary reason I was at that stage. I 
had come to secure a spot for the act 
that would follow them on the Bud 
Light stage: Tame Impala. 
Friday was an experience similar 
to 
Thursday: 
The 
earlier 
sets 
were mixed in quality, generally 
functioning better as background 
music than as something to really 
get into. The headliners and higher-
billed artists performing later tended 
to live up to expectations. Four days 
is perhaps a little too long for such an 
intense festival — Lollapalooza used 
to just be three days until 2015, when 
they switched to four for reasons 
unknown (money). The need to be 
as big as possible, while probably a 
clever business decision, has diluted 
each individual day’s lineup and 
contributed to a sort of festival 
fatigue. Four days is a long time, and 
people seemed to already be feeling 
the marathon catching up to them by 
the end of Friday. Perhaps it’s time 
for another change. 

We loved Lollapalooza so much
that this took a month to publish

MICHIGAN ESCAPES IN 20T

All Aidan Hutchinson remembers is that 
Michigan was in its base defense.
He doesn’t remember bending around one 
lineman and going through another. He 
doesn’t remember that Kwity Paye had 
already hit Army’s Kelvin Hopkins and he 
doesn’t remember extending his left arm, 
knocking the ball loose. He just knows he 
hit the quarterback. After that, he blacked 
out, in a celebratory haze. He wasn’t the only 
one.
So did Zach Charboonnet and so did Paye 
himself, the man who pounced on the ball, 
waiting at the center of a packed Michigan 
Stadium for the referee to confirm what the 
whole building already knew, then charging 
upfield to the student section to commem-
orate a game that should have been routine 
and instead was anything but.
“Whatever I did,” Hutchinson said after-
wards, the game ball placed next to him on 
the podium, “hopefully, it was good.”
It was. Without it, Army might have picked 
up a third-down conversion, breathing new 
life into its offense when a touchdown would 
have won the game in the second overtime. 
Thanks to that play, Michigan escaped an 
upset bid, pulling out a 24-21 double-OT 
win over Army, moving to 2-0 in a game that 
could have derailed its season before Big Ten 
play even started.
The Wolverines needed Army to miss a 
50-yard field goal as time expired in regu-
lation to even get as far as overtime. After 
trading scores in the first OT, Michigan got 
nothing on its next three plays, setting up a 
43-yard kick from Jake Moody and putting 
the weight of the world on its defense’s 
shoulders.
They carried it.
“That was a gem of a defensive performance, 
there’s no doubt about it,” Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh said. “Talk about the last play, 
the last series, just the entire football game.”
Despite the positivity of the head coach, all 
the promise of Michigan’s offseason seemed 
to evaporate in the September heat, a heavily 
advertised offense struggling to move the 
ball and a defense that got pushed around at 
times by a smaller Army offensive line.
Two first-half fumbles handed Army a half-
time lead, the Wolverines’ only score coming 
after a fake punt extended a drive. Midway 

through the third quarter, Michigan still 
seemed poised for collapse.
Then, staring at third down on Michigan’s 
five-yard line, Army coach Jeff Monken 
decided to throw the ball. Lavert Hill picked 
the floating football out of the air and a 
cheer came in the form of 111,000 exhales. 
On the ensuing drive, it took a third-down 
pass interference and a perfectly-placed ball 
from Shea Patterson to Ronnie Bell, also 
on third down, to keep things moving. But 
freshman running back Zach Charbonnet 
punched it in from a yard out for his second 
of three touchdowns on the day, knotting 
things up at 14.
The score stayed there until overtime as 
Michigan failed to convert a red-zone 
chance deep in the fourth quarter, Army 
stuffing Charbonnet on fourth-and-2 and 
bringing all of Michigan Stadium’s anxiety 
to a nadir.
After the game, Harbaugh said the pass 
protection was “really good,” acknowledging 
only missed assignments on Patterson’s two 
fumbles. He said left tackle Jon Runyan Jr. 
will likely play after the bye week and went 
out of his way to praise Ryan Hayes’ perfor-
mance in his stead. He rejected outright a 
question about the run-heavy second half 
and had little patience for another about 
whether Patterson not keeping the ball on 
option runs had to do with a minor injury 
suffered last week. 
Still, the fact remains: This did not look like 
a team ready to compete for anything, and 
the schedule does not get any easier.
Josh Gattis’ offense, which promised an 
up-tempo, modern attack, has failed to 
sustain success, averaging just 4.5 yards per 
play against Army. The offensive line looked 
out of its depth in protection against a Black 
Knight defense that must blitz constantly 
to make up for a lack of size. Injured or not, 
Patterson has seemed reluctant to run the 
ball, and he’s fumbled four times in two 
weeks.
“We just got some kinks in the offense that 
we’re still working through,” senior guard 
Ben Bredeson said. “It’s a new look for us. 
We’re two weeks in and going into this bye 
week, going into the Big Ten season, it’ll be 
good for us. 
“We’ve seen what’s working for us, what’s 
not and we’ll be able to make some changes.”

touchdown. His internal clock 
seemed off in the pocket and 
that Bell miss wasn’t his only 
one. On zone reads — or at least 
on plays that seemed like zone 
reads — Patterson refused to 
keep the ball even when his 
rushing lanes were wide open. 
Though a lingering injury from 
last week may have been a hin-
drance, he bears a fair amount 
of blame for Michigan’s near-
implosion on Saturday, as it took 
two overtimes and a missed 
field goal at the end of regula-
tion to put away Army, 24-21. 
Predictably, Saturday brought 
with it cries for a change at 
quarterback. 
Jim Harbaugh 
said during 
the preseason 
he wanted to 
play Patterson 
and redshirt 
sophomore 
Dylan McCaf-
frey in each 
game, and he’s 
lived up to his 
word thus far. 
On rare occasions that Patterson 
left games last year, McCaffrey 
acquitted himself well. He’s 
done enough to be a clear suc-
cessor when Patterson leaves 
after this season, and in the 
minds of some, enough to start 
right now.
It makes sense to be alarmed 

right now — to see the need for 
change. The Wolverines are 
lucky to have won their first 
two games despite both coming 
against clearly inferior teams. 
They’ll go to Wisconsin after the 
bye week, seemingly unready to 
win a game of that magnitude, 
and with Michigan’s goals, a loss 
in the third game of the season 
means perfection is required the 
rest of the way. It doesn’t make 
sense to bench Patterson as a 
result of that alarm. He isn’t the 
problem. Everything else is.
It’s a problem that an offense 
meant to be predicated on run-
pass options has barely run any 
run-pass options through two 
games. It’s a problem that Josh 
Gattis has struggled to find a 
playcalling rhythm in his first 
two games with the job. It’s a 
problem that Michigan fell into 
old, predictable habits — three 
yards and a cloud of dust — late 
in a close game against Army. 
It’s an even bigger problem that 
its offensive line couldn’t push 
around a team with no defen-
sive linemen over 300 pounds 
or keep Patterson safe in the 
pocket.
“I thought our pass protec-
tion was really good,” Harbaugh 
said after the game. “At times, 
we had a long time 
back there in the 
pocket and some 
of the big third-
down conversions 
were by pass.”
That there are 
even questions 
about an offensive 
line that returned 
four starters from 
last year, includ-
ing a preseason 
All-American in Ben Bredeson, 
undermines his point. Jon Run-
yan Jr. is expected to return 
against Wisconsin, which will 
likely help things. But it doesn’t 
change that the line wasn’t 
good enough against the Black 
Knights.
“Mostly I would say just some 

of the blitz pickups,” running 
back Zach Charbonnet said 
when asked what needs improv-
ing. “They had a lot of corners 
blitzing and we just gotta adjust 
to that.”
Fix all of this and the quar-
terback issue becomes trivial, 
because the fact remains that 
Patterson is a good quarterback. 
Not just that, but he’s the best 
quarterback Michigan has had 
in a decade, at least, when it 
comes to throwing the ball (that 
thing quarterbacks are sup-
posed to do).
Patterson threw for 2,600 
yards in 2018, averaging 8.0 per 
attempt and turning the passing 
game into a legitimate weapon. 
He wasn’t the savior people 
advertised him as, and that label 
was always unfair — a way to 
tear him down for not reaching 
an unreachable expectation.
None of this is to say Pat-

terson doesn’t have issues to 
fix. Fumbling four times in two 
games is a very real problem. 
Harbaugh said last week that 
Patterson suf-
fered an injury 
against Middle 
Tennessee State, 
and video from 
the locker room 
made it seem 
that it was a rib 
issue. If you’re 
looking for a 
reason he didn’t 
pull the ball and 
run more against 
Army when there were oodles 
of space in his path, that might 
be it.
“He was better,” Harbaugh 
said, which is what he had 
to say. “He was able to work 
through what he had and felt 
100 percent for the game.”
When a reporter followed up 

and asked whether that meant 
those plays didn’t have reads 
attached to them, Harbaugh 
replied, “Yeah, or the read was 
not there for the 
quarterback to 
pull it.”
Regardless, it 
undermines the 
very foundation 
of Michigan’s 
offense if the 
entire defense 
knows the ball is 
going to the run-
ning back every 
time the quarter-
back starts to hand it off. If Pat-
terson isn’t healthy enough to 
make a legitimate read, asking 
whether he should start is valid. 
If he is healthy enough to do 
that and Michigan simply wasn’t 
attaching reads to anything, the 
fault lies with Gattis.
This is his offense. He should 

run it as he advertised it.
On rare occasions when the 
Wolverines have put their foot 
on the gas — running RPOs, 
moving fast and keeping the 
defense off-balance — things 
have looked as good as prom-
ised, Patterson very much 
included.
This won’t work if Michigan 
either can’t do that because of 
Patterson’s health, or it simply 
won’t. “Where is the speed in 
space?” a reporter asked Ben 
Bredeson after Saturday’s game.
If that question is valid after 
any other game this season, 
Michigan has done something 
wrong, and it will never be fixed 
by going to the backup quarter-
back.

SportsMonday Column: Patterson isn’t the problem

ETHAN
SEARS

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily
Senior quarterback Shea Patterson has not played to his potential, losing three fumbles, but the fault for the Wolverines’ offensive struggles lies elsewhere.

At times, we 
had a long time 
back there in 
the pocket.

They had a 
lot of corners 
blitzing and we 
gotta adjust.

Lack of ball security haunts ‘M’

After a comfortable win over 
Middle Tennessee last week, 
Shea Patterson sat at the podium 
fielding questions. He seemed 
anything but comfortable as he 
got candid with reporters.
“A win’s a win,” the senior 
quarterback said then. “But I 
think everybody in that locker 
room knows that we didn’t live 
up to our standards and I put 
that on me. I gotta take care of 
the football. We got the W but we 
just gotta play better. I gotta play 
better.”
Patterson wasn’t available a 
week later, after the Michigan 
football 
team’s 
24-21 
win 
over Army in double overtime 
Saturday. But his words echoed 
through the press conference 
nonetheless.
I gotta take care of the football.
Because a week after Patterson 
fumbled on the first drive, leading 
to easy Blue Raider points, he did 
the same exact thing, leading to 
easy Black Knight points. This 
time, on first down at the Army 
43, Patterson dropped back to 
pass. The rushers came. He 
couldn’t escape and let the ball 
go. It squirted out of his arms and 
off to the side as a Black Knight 
fell on it. Five minutes later, 
Army had a 7-0 lead.
The Wolverines got the ball 
back and scored a touchdown. 
They kicked off and Army 
fumbled in its own territory. 
Michigan had the ball and a 
chance.
Then, 
the 
Black 
Knights 
brought 
a 
blitz. 
Sophomore 
running back Christian Turner 
couldn’t see it coming. They 
came for Patterson and sacked 
him again. The ball came out. 
Army had it.
“You can’t get that loose with 
the ball,” said Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh. “The first one 
was (Patterson’s) and the second 
one was the missed protection 
with the running back.”
As if that weren’t enough, the 
Wolverines lost another fumble 
on their very next drive, when 
sophomore running back Ben 
Van Sumeren lost the ball before 

being brought down. The Black 
Knights got the ball at Michigan’s 
40 and scored a touchdown then, 
too.
Three giveaways on three 
straight drives is never a good 
thing, but against Army and its 
clock-draining triple option — 
designed to limit possession — it 
was almost fatal. The Wolverines 
had 
squandered 
three 
vital 
opportunities and gifted the 
Black Knights 14 points.
“I’d love to get three turnovers 
every half,” said Army coach Jeff 
Monken. “We’d probably not lose 
a game again.”
A damning statement from the 
20-point underdog.
To his credit, Patterson didn’t 
get down on himself after that. 
He had one of the loudest voices 
in the huddle, telling everyone it 
was going to be alright.
Eventually, it was. But it took 
double overtime and — ironically 
— a strip sack on the final play 
that the Wolverines recovered.
After the game, the players 
were happy with the way they’d 
fought back. They didn’t have 
any turnovers in the second 
half, and the defense did its job. 
No one pointed fingers. They 
stuck together, determined to 
win it. But even then, it wasn’t 
satisfying.

“It 
was 
frustrating,” 
said 
junior defensive end Kwity Paye. 
“ … We should’ve played better.”
That’s two weeks in a row a 
player has said those words. Sure, 
a win’s a win, but at some point it 
becomes more a question.
When Paye and sophomore 
defensive end Aidan Hutchinson 
went after Army quarterback 
Kelvin Hopkins Jr. on third-
and-11 in double overtime and 
stripped the ball out, it was a 
sort of cathartic release, the ball 
security issues the Black Knights 
took advantage of all day coming 
back to haunt them. Hutchinson 
brought the game ball to the press 
conference — a simultaneous 
reminder of the defense’s heroics 
and the offense it had to bail out 
in the first place.
Harbaugh praised the defense 
postgame. He praised the team’s 
resilience. Then, he suggested 
more live tackling in practice 
for the running backs, as if that 
would cure the mental mistakes 
that have plagued Patterson and 
others. Sometimes, the solution 
is as Patterson said himself: I 
gotta take care of the football. I 
gotta play better.
After a second straight game 
of security issues, his words 
from last week are a good place 
to start.

Offense struggles to deliver on hype

Tarik Black laid on the 15-yard 
line, face buried in the turf as Shea 
Patterson’s pass attempt hit the 
sideline beyond him.
If Army’s final drive of overtime 
had gone a little differently — 
ending with the Black Knights 
streaming into the south end zone 
rather than the Wolverines into 
the north one — it would have 
been the perfect summation of 
Saturday afternoon.
Instead, 
Michigan 
rescued 
the game from the precipice of 
disaster and escaped with a 24-21, 
double-overtime win. Its last 
offensive play — the mistimed 
comeback route that sent Black 
to the turf — faded into memory, 
but the big-picture offensive 
frustration remained.
“There are just a lot of details 
that we need to clean up,” said 
freshman running back Zach 
Charbonnet. “And we’ve just 
got to thank the defense for 
stopping them when we had those 
turnovers and just giving us a 
chance to come back.”
Through no fault of his own, 
Charbonnet felt the crescendo 
of Saturday’s frustration. On 
Michigan’s 
second 
play 
of 
overtime, he took his 32nd 

carry of the game, saw only a blur 
of Army defensive lineman in 
front of him and got stuffed at the 
line of scrimmage with no other 
alternative. As Charbonnet hit the 
turf, his yards per carry standing 
at an even 3.0, a parade of boos 
rained down from a disgruntled 
fanbase.
Seeing a star running back 
stopped at the line of scrimmage 
with nowhere to go is a sight at 
once familiar and unexpected. 
Through 
three 
first-half 
turnovers and one missed field 
goal, it was that innocuous run up 
the middle that drew Saturday’s 
biggest boos.
For 
eight 
months, 
after 
Michigan 
hired 
offensive 
coordinator Josh Gattis, this 
play-calling 
— 
the 
repeated 
inside 
zones, 
perhaps 
thinly 
veiled with a read that carried 
no threat of a quarterback keeper 
— was paraded as a relic of the 
past. 
When 
Michigan 
came 
out and threw the ball 25 times 
before halftime against Middle 
Tennessee State last week, there 
was evidence to support that 
promise.
“Obviously, 
expectations, 
everyone tries to make it as 
sunshine 
and 
rainbows 
as 
possible,” 
senior 
guard 
Ben 
Bredeson said Saturday. “So this 
was good for us, it shows us what 
we need to work on as we head 
into the Big Ten season.”
Against 
Army, 
that 
all 
evaporated, culminating in a 
pair of failed 4th down attempts 
on consecutive fourth-quarter 
drives, each in Black Knight 
territory. Each time, Michigan 
faced a fourth-and-2 with a 
chance to right three quarters of 
offensive wrongs. And each time, 
Charbonnet was stopped, sending 
Army’s offense back onto the field.
After the game, the reflections 
remained calm, various position 
groups refusing to pin blame 
on one another. But perhaps 
Harbaugh, 
after 
crediting 
analytics with the decision to go 
for it, offered up the reason that 
reality didn’t follow suit.
“They had a better defensive 
call than we had a —,” he said, 
stopping himself mid-sentence, 
“than we executed our offensive 

play.”
It was the only time Harbaugh 
allowed a glimpse into Saturday’s 
playcalling, even if he cut himself 
off mid-sentence. When asked 
about the pass-run split that 
reverted back to 2018’s averages, 
he called the question “low-
hanging fruit” — “... We could 
go every game with the ‘Why 
didn’t you pass when you ran and 
it didn’t work so you should’ve 
passed?’ We could do this for 
every game that’s ever played in 
football.”
But when an entire offseason 
carries the promise of a downfield 
passing attack and your leading 
receiver from a year ago — junior 
Nico Collins — sees three targets 
compared to 45 rushing attempts, 
these are the questions that 
follow.
Asked about the reasons he 
may have shied away from the 
pass — Army’s defensive setup, 
inconsistent 
pass-protection, 
Patterson’s 
two 
fumbles 
— 
Harbaugh rebuffed.
“At times, we had a long 
time back there in the pocket,” 
Harbaugh said. “And some of the 
big third down conversions were 
by pass.”
Therein lies the frustration. 
According the Harbaugh, the 
passing game was working. And 
yet he repeatedly turned to a 
rushing attack that managed just 
2.4 yards per carry.
The play after Charbonnet’s 
run up the middle brought a 
chorus of boos, Gattis dialed up a 
pass and Patterson hit sophomore 
receiver Ronnie Bell for a first 
down on a crossing route to keep 
Michigan alive. Two plays later, 
Charbonnet was in the end zone.
“When we get our tempo going 
and we move the ball in the run 
game, it kind of sets everything 
else up,” Bredeson said. “We want 
to get the defense on their heels 
and keep going. I like when we’re 
rolling that way.”
Saturday 
afternoon, 
those 
moments were limited to fleeting 
spells amid a slew of turnovers 
and penalties.
And with it, the “sunshine 
and 
rainbows” 
of 
offseason 
expectations 
continued 
to 
dissolve into a harsher reality.

Senior quarterback Shea Patterson has fumbled four times, losing three, over Michigan’s first two games.

Offense plagues Wolverines in loss

In the 86th minute of the 
Michigan 
women’s 
soccer 
team’s match against Notre 
Dame, junior midfielder Sarah 
Stratigakis received a strong 
cross from the wing and fired 
a header on goal. The shot 
was the Wolverines’ best and 
final chance to go ahead, but 
Fighting 
Irish 
goalkeeper 
Mattie Interian denied it with a 
diving stop. 
Seconds 
later, 
Michigan’s 
fortunes 
shifted 
drastically. 
Instead 
of 
celebrating 
a 
dramatic, 
game-winning 
goal, the Wolverines found 
themselves chasing Notre Dame 
forward Kiki Van Zanten as she 
charged through the Michigan 
back line and buried a header 
on a flawless cross. Instead of 
walking away with a solid non-
conference win, the Wolverines 
left the field with a 1-0 loss. 
For Michigan (3-1-0), the 
defeat 
was 
marked 
by 
an 
inability to convert offensively. 
The Wolverines only managed 
seven shot attempts to Notre 
Dame’s 13, despite roughly even 
possession time. 

“I think we just need to 
shoot,” said Michigan coach 
Jennifer Klein. “I think it looks 
like we’re looking for this magic 
opportunity, and I think you 
just gotta swing it and get the 
ball in the frame and see what 
happens.”
From 
the 
start, 
the 
Wolverines struggled to find 
any rhythm offensively, failing 
to register a shot until the 
20th minute, when a weak 
Stratigakis 
header 
bounced 
safely into Interian’s mitts. The 
first half featured conservative, 
possession-oriented 
soccer 
from both sides, characterized 
by short passes and a strong 
emphasis on defense. 
Still, turnovers in the midfield 
created some opportunities for 
Michigan, including its best 
first-half scoring opportunity. 
In the 25th minute, a Fighting 
Irish turnover in their own end 
led to a scoring chance at the 
top of the box for sophomore 
midfielder Raleigh Loughman. 
The 
shot 
was 
strong, 
but 
fired straight into Interian’s 
arms, and the game remained 
scoreless going into halftime. 
“Once 
the 
game 
settled, 
we 
started 
to 
gain 
some 

momentum,” Klein said. “We 
went into halftime with a really 
good fire and creating some 
really good opportunities.”
The second half featured 
much of the same, with both 
teams continuing to emphasize 
sound defense over explosive 
offense. Early on, a defensive 
lapse from the Wolverines left 
Notre Dame midfielder Luisa 
Delgado open at the top of the 
box, but her shot sailed just 
over the woodwork, keeping the 
game level at zero. 
Michigan used its superior 
speed in the second half to 
get behind the Fighting Irish 
defense on runs, but misplaced 
and overshot passes prevented 
it from capitalizing on these 
opportunities. For the latter 
part of the second half, the 
Wolverines appeared to be in 
control, with Stratigakis, junior 
forward Emma Cooper and 
fifth-year senior defender Sura 
Yekka all tallying shots in the 
final ten minutes.
But in the end, Van Zanten’s 
86th minute score proved to be 
too much for the Michigan to 
overcome, and the Wolverines’ 
inability to find the back of the 
net became their downfall.

Ragen leads Michigan to shutout win

Calm, cool and collected. 
Those three words typified 
Jackson Ragen’s play Friday 
night against Cornell. Thanks 
in large part to the junior 
centerback’s goal and defensive 
performance, 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
soccer 
team 
(2-1) 
dominated the Big Red, 3-0, 
earning their second victory in 
a row. 
“We started a little bit nervy 
on defense with some of our 
clearances and back passes but 
after that we settled in,” said 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley. 
“I thought our (defenders) were 
absolutely spot on after that. 
They made some desperation 
blocks in the first half. In the 
second half, they moved their 
feet, they defended well and 
cleared their lines.” 
In a game where Cornell 
(0-1) registered only one shot 
on target, Ragen never looked 
rattled 
and 
commanded 
a 
restructured 
backline 
with 
relative 
ease. 
The 
junior 
displayed why he’s the clear 
leader of the backline with the 
most starting experience of 
Michigan’s defensive unit. 
Having entered college as 
a 2017 NSCA All-American 
and a member of the 2017 U.S. 
Soccer 
Nationals 
Best 
XI, 
Ragen played in 16 matches 
as a freshman Wolverine and 
started in 10 of them. As a 
sophomore, he started all 21 
games and was named to the 
All-Big Ten Tournament Team. 
With 
the 
departures 
of 
veteran 
defenders 
Daniel 
Mukuna, 
Marcello 
Borges 
and Peter Brown from last 
year’s team, Ragen is now 
the anchor of a Wolverines’ 
defense comprised of two first-
time starters — junior fullback 
Joel Harrison and freshman 
fullback Carter Payne — and 
senior 
centerback 
Abdou 
Samake, 
who 
started 
only 
seven games last season.

As 
a 
result, 
Ragen 
has 
needed to be much more of a 
vocal leader than in previous 
seasons. Friday night Ragen 
could be heard directing his 
teammates into the proper 
position constantly. 
“I have a lot experience after 
last year,” Ragen said. “I feel 
like I can help control the game 
with my comments and just 
helping the younger guys out.” 
With over 18 minutes to go 
and Michigan leading 2-0, 
Ragen sprawled out to block 
a shot from Cornell’s John 
Scearce in the box. Ragen’s 
6-foot-5 frame, 
speed 
and 
composure 
have made him 
a 
formidable 
defender 
to 
challenge 
in 
the air or on 
the ground. 
That 
size 
even 
helped 
him 
score 
a 
goal off a set-
piece against the Big Red. Out-
muscling his defender, Ragen 
reached out a foot to a deep 
free-kick from outside the box 
and nudged it past Cornell’s 
goalkeeper 
Brady 
McSwain 
from a tight angle. 
“It was a great ball by (junior 
midfielder) 
Mark 
(Ybarra),” 
Ragen said. “I was just trying 
to get across it and get my foot 
on it. Couldn’t have asked for a 

better ball in, though.” 
Though 
he’s 
mainly 
out 
there to stabilize the backline 
and 
limit 
the 
opponent’s 
chances, Ragen has also shown 
the ability to finish. It was his 
fourth career goal. 
Having given up four goals to 
Florida Gulf Coast in the season 
opener and a questionable goal 
to SIUE last Monday, shoring 
up the defense was a point of 
emphasis for the Wolverines 
coming into the game Friday’s 
contest. 
Ragen’s 
leadership, 
steadiness, 
and 
challenges 
— not to mention his goal — 
were crucial to 
Michigan getting 
its first shut-out 
of the season. 
“We 
want 
Jackson 
to 
continue 
to 
grow,” 
Daley 
said. 
“He’s 
obviously one of 
the main men in 
the 
group. 
He 
demonstrated 
that last year. His personality 
needs to match his quality and 
he’s getting there. He had a 
little bit of a taste of adversity 
and was a little quiet but now 
I think he likes being on top of 
games.
“From our standpoint, he’s 
done incredibly well and we 
hope he continues to grow 
exponentially over the next 
season.”

A year ago, the Michigan 
volleyball 
team’s 
offense 
started and ended with Carly 
Skjodt.
The senior outside hitter was 
responsible for nearly a third of 
the Wolverines’ total offense 
during their 2018 campaign, 
which ended in Michigan’s 
seventh trip to the Sweet 
Sixteen in program history. 
Skjodt served as the workhorse 
for most of the season, leading 
the Wolverines in kills in 
24 of their 34 matches. She 
recorded 29 double-digit kill 
performances 
and 
eclipsed 
the 20-kill mark seven times, 
earning 
second 
team 
All-
American 
honors 
for 
her 
efforts.
This year, the No. 14 Michigan 
volleyball team knows Skjodt’s 
production is gone. And with 
such 
a 
realization 
comes 
another: Nobody on the roster 
can replicate the numbers she 
posted.
So, the Wolverines (4-2) have 
chosen to adapt rather than 
force.
Their offensive makeover 
was 
on 
full 
display 
over 
the weekend at the Dayton 
Invitational, 
even 
as 
they 
lost two of three matches 
against unranked competition 
in the Flyers and Missouri. 
Throughout 
the 
non-
conference tri-match, senior 
setter MacKenzi Welsh turned 
to three relatively new faces 
— senior outside hitter Sydney 
Wetterstrom 
and 
freshman 
middle blockers May Pertofsky 
and 
Jess 
Robinson 
— 
to 
shoulder the majority of the 
burden.
Though it’s still admittedly a 
work in progress, as seen in the 
two weekend losses, things are 
moving in the right direction. 
When the team controls the 
ball, it gives those three new 
faces a chance to shine.
While 
Pertofsky 
and 
Robinson are still acclimating to 
the college level, Wetterstrom 
appeared in 23 of Michigan’s 

34 matches in 2018. She tallied 
163 kills on a mediocre .220 
attack percentage. Sophomore 
outside hitter Paige Jones, who 
finished with the second-most 
kills on the team last season, 
has seen a similar volume to 
begin 2019. 
Jones was the only Wolverine 
besides Skjodt to reach the 175-
kill milestone a season ago, 
a sign of dependence on the 
outside hitters. But through six 
matches without Skjodt, four 
different Michigan players — 
Wetterstrom, Jones, Pertofsky 
and Robinson — have already 
recorded at least 45 kills. For 
reference, that’s a 250-kill pace.
“There’s way more options,” 
Wolverine coach Mark Rosen 
said. “There’s way more things 
we can do and that’s a good 
thing.”
The new offense is a credit to 
Welsh’s willingness to embrace 
a fresh system. This season’s 
balanced three-middle offense 
is a far cry from last year’s 
outside hitter-reliant strategy, 
and its success is contingent on 
Welsh’s commitment to keeping 
every attacker involved.
“Setters don’t always set 
with a purpose, (sometimes) 
they just deliver balls,” Rosen 
said. “Today, I thought she 
was purposeful. Every set she 
set was with the objective of 
getting a kill. … The one thing 
with having more options is 
that you have to make more 
decisions. She’s handling that 
really well.
“You treat it a little bit like 

a kid in a candy store. She’s 
got to make a choice to get it 
to the right person at the right 
time and tonight she did an 
outstanding job.”
In Michigan’s five-set loss 
against Dayton on Saturday 
night, six players saw at least 
15 
attack 
attempts. 
Welsh 
has made the transition from 
setting one player at will to 
running an offense in which 
every 
weapon 
is 
involved, 
including herself.
Surprisingly 
enough, 
the 
Wolverines’ offense has taken 
a step forward since Skjodt’s 
departure. The unit’s attack 
percentage is 53 percentage 
points higher, Welsh is making 
the most of her new options and 
the middle blockers are more 
effective than they were at any 
point last season.
Though 
a 
two-week, 
six-games 
sample 
may 
not 
be 
enough 
to 
draw 
any 
conclusions, this season’s start 
has been an encouraging sign 
for the Michigan. A balanced 
offense could be what the 
Wolverines need to break into 
the upper echelon of the Big 
Ten, which boasts seven top-18 
teams in the national poll.
This year, such an offense 
rides on its setter — not its 
primary weapon. So far, that’s 
made all the difference.
“(Welsh) did a great job of 
making the people around her 
better,” Rosen said. “She’s our 
floor captain — that’s what you 
want that player to do and I was 
really proud of her.”

Call it inexperience or early-
season jitters, but the No. 14 
Michigan volleyball team’s first 
road trip of the year did not live 
up to the team’s ranking.
Its first match of the Dayton 
Invitational put the squad’s 
youth on full display.
Right 
out 
of 
the 
gates, 
Missouri’s aggressive offense 
and serving approach exposed 
the 
Wolverines’ 
biggest 
weaknesses: first contact and 
ball control. Consequently, the 
Tigers (4-0) breezed through 
the first two sets, winning 
them, 25-12 and 25-13. In 
the third set, Michigan (4-2) 
punched back, and at one point 
led, 18-14, before losing the final 
set, 25-23.
“One of the more frustrating, 
difficult matches I have ever 
been a part of,” said coach Mark 
Rosen. “Nothing was working.”
Several hours later, against 
Northern Illinois (2-5), the 
Wolverines could have easily 
succumbed to their frustration.
Against a Huskies team that 
came out playing with nothing 
to lose, Michigan’s first touches 
were more crisp and its passes 

were more accurate, but it still 
showed signs of cracks.
As 
the 
game 
wore 
on, 
though, 
the 
Wolverines 
grew more comfortable and 
elevated their defensive and 
offensive execution. In turn, 
they obliterated the Huskies 
and swept the match, 25-19, 
25-18, 25-9. Compared to their 
match against Missouri, the 
Wolverines made ten fewer 
errors, hit .322 points higher 
and registered 17 more kills.
“You 
could 
just 
see 
us 
shaking off the 
frustration from 
that first match,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“We 
allowed 
ourselves to just 
play 
volleyball 
the 
way 
we 
needed to play 
it.”
The following 
night, Michigan 
looked to parlay 
the previous night’s success 
into a win against tournament 
host Dayton (3-4). In front 
of the largest crowd in Flyer 
history, the young Wolverines 
were not fazed.
Michigan dropped the first 
set, 28-26, but rallied back to 

take the second. After trading 
sets through the first four, the 
Wolverines took the floor for 
the 5th in a race to 15. In such an 
expedited set, both teams knew 
the importance of a big lead and 
it was Dayton who grabbed it.
Redshirt sophomore Jamie 
Peterson propelled the run 
behind one of the nation’s 
deadliest serves. She stumped 
the Wolverines and secured a 
commanding 11-4 lead for the 
Flyers in the process.
Down but not out, Michigan 
battled to the 
end, 
drawing 
within two late 
in 
the 
game. 
But, the effort 
was not enough 
as Dayton took 
the set, 15-12, 
and 
thus 
the 
match to drop 
the Wolverines’ 
weekend record 
to 1-2.
“We don’t look for moral 
victories,” Rosen said after the 
match while trying to remain 
positive. “But at the same time 
we have to look at the process 
and make sure we are focused 
on doing what we need to do to 
get better as the year goes on.”

Sports
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Donning a plush blanket and 
a 
happy-go-lucky 
demeanor, 
Kevin and Paula Cooper sat 
atop Section 10 of Michigan 
Stadium late Saturday morning. 
They were there early to catch 
a glimpse of their son, David, 
who’s one of Army’s backup 
kickers. Paula served in the 
military from 1992-1997. Kevin 
has served the last 27 years.
“I’m just happy to be here,” 
Paula said, as the conversation 
wound down. “Did I mention 
that?”
It was still hours before two 
fourth-down stops rattled the 
steel beams supporting sections 
8-12. 
Hours 
before 
inches 
separated her son’s team from 
a monumental upset win and 
hours before the defeat that 
ensued. Hours before Kwity 
Paye and Aidan Hutchinson 
rescued a lackluster Michigan 
performance, forcing a fumble 
in overtime to somehow salvage 
a 24-21 win. 
There will be droves of 
analysis on what that means, 
how it came to be, where things 
go now. Soon thereafter, it 
will be discarded into the vast 
archives, receding under the 
tidal wave of whatever happens 
next.
Some spent the afternoon 
lamenting Michigan’s decision 
to schedule Army in the first 
place. Playing against a triple-
option the second week of the 
season, the thinking went, only 
invited pitfalls. The logic is 
sound.
But there were reminders 
littered 
throughout 
every 
crevice of Michigan Stadium 
of the larger factors at play. 
College football itself is a 
uniquely American enterprise, 
warts and all. Within that 
ecosystem, military academies 
are the living embodiment of 

that patriotism. If you dug deep 
enough Saturday, walked to 
enough sections, stumbled upon 
enough clues, it wasn’t hard to 
unearth a microcosm of what 
this sport, at its best, can mean 
to those who celebrate it.
“They’re 
going 
to 
be 
teammates and most of them 
are going to go straight into a 
combat zone. So what they’re 
building here will stand in a 
good stint for the next 40 years. 
He and I have been classmates 
for 40 years — ‘78,” said Chuck 
Dimeco, a former Army football 
player, 
before 
the 
game, 
gesturing to the man seated 
by his side. “That, I think, is 
different than what you get at a 
regular university. These guys 

have a reason for being there 
other than being on the field.
“It’s 
a 
loyalty 
to 
the 
institution, to the Army, to the 
communities, to the people who 
sacrificed. It just brings back 
memories that 99 percent of the 
population will never have.”
One 
man, 
watching 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
from 
the 
concourse, said he attended 
a 1,700-person Army tailgate 
before the game. “I might not 
know everyone (there),” he said, 
“but I know somebody who 
knows somebody, who knows 
somebody.”
As he spoke, a friend nudged 
his shoulder, trying to get his 
attention. The two exchange 
pleasantries before he walked 

off to the restroom.
“Bill’s still in the army, but 
I hadn’t talked to him in 20 
years,” gesturing to his friend, 
now walking away. “I reached 
out to him like five years ago. 
It’s like he’s my roommate again 
— calls me everyday, we hang 
out. He moved to Madison. He’s 
an army colonel, and he’s up in 
Madison stationed out there. 
… So we all come here not only 
for the game — 50 percent of 
the game and the 50 percent is 
the camaraderie and the bond 
that we reconnect when we get 
here.”
That understanding is part 
of the “Long Gray Line” — a 
phrase those at West Point use 
to bind Army graduates past, 

present and future.
For some, that manifests 
itself through family lineage. 
Darrell Scales sat next to his 
wife, Katie, and one of their 
daughters. Both Darrell and 
Katie were Army alums, and 
had driven up from Atlanta for 
the game.
“For our girls, they just want 
to be a part of the gray line,” 
Katie said. “ ‘That Long Gray 
Line,’ they call it.”
As 
Army’s 
stranglehold 
on the game tightened, their 
excitement grew. The roars 
became louder. High-fives more 
intense. Sure, it was one thing 
to see the tailgates, reunite 
with friends, share in a bond. It 
would’ve been another for that 

traveling contingent to walk out 
of Michigan Stadium with a win 
for the ages.
Michigan fans resorted to 
nervous 
tendencies 
outside 
section 11 — one nursing a Diet 
Coke, another clutching his 
vape — while Army fans kept 
their cool. Eric Lee, a father of 
an Army student, slotted his 
hands in his pockets, watching 
the field goal at the end of 
regulation drift ever-so-slightly 
right and fall ever-so-slightly 
short.
“You know what the student 
body is at West Point,” he chided 
after the miss, “right?”
When the game ended — an 
abrupt halt to Army’s upset bid 
— Michigan players joined with 
Army players, gathered around 
those dressed in uniform on 
the sideline. Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh had asked Army 
coach Jeff Monken before the 
game if they had a postgame 
ritual the Wolverines should 
partake in. Monken explained 
they sing the alma mater, and 
he’d be honored if Michigan 
joined. 
So there they were, conjoined 
under a bright blue sky. The 
crowd stood up. The alma mater 
blared. The whisper of “U-S-
A” soon cascaded into a full-
stadium chant. The players all 
stood there, bound by a sport 
that is stitched together by its 
eccentricities. 
“I’m proud of our guys,” 
Monken said shortly after. “I’m 
proud of how they represented 
West Point today. I’m proud 
of how they represented the 
United States Army. I hope that 
everybody that had a chance to 
watch — not everybody bought a 
ticket, them included, people on 
TV, I’m sure they were watching 
— we made them proud of our 
United States Army and the 
determination of the American 
soldier. Because that’s what 
those guys are.”

A near loss, with plenty gained

On a day when Michigan skirted a disastrous loss, there were plenty of reminders of a greater meaning

Fake punt propels ‘M’ in victory

In 
his 
postgame 
press 
conference 
Saturday, 
Army 
coach Jeff Monken emphasized 
one play more than any other.
It 
wasn’t 
any 
of 
his 
team’s 
three 
touchdowns or 
three 
fumble 
recoveries. 
It 
wasn’t 
the 
clinching 
play 
of 
the 
game, 
where 
his 
quarterback 
was 
sacked 
and 
fumbled. 
It 
wasn’t 
the 
Black Knights’ 
missed 
game-winning 
field 
goal attempt, either.
Monken wanted one play 
back: Michigan’s fake punt.
“We knew we needed to get 
some turnovers if we were 
gonna beat them,” Monken 
said. “We had to get some balls 
away from them and steal a 
possession, and they stole one 
from us on the fake punt. That 
was my call. … They stole one 
from us there and it’s probably 
my greatest regret.”
The 
game 
couldn’t 

have started out any more 
disastrous for the Wolverines. 
Senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson fumbled on the first 
drive, gifting Army the ball 
and an eventual touchdown. 
Michigan got the ball back, of 
course, but it wasn’t long before 
the Wolverines 
ran into trouble 
again.
Michigan’s 
drive stalled as 
it faced fourth-
and-5 
from 
its own 47. To 
make 
matters 
worse, 
it 
seemed, senior 
linebacker 
Devin 
Gil’s 
false start moved everyone 
back five yards.
But before the false start, 
the Michigan coaches noticed 
something 
in 
the 
Black 
Knights’ punt coverage. They’d 
eschewed a deep corner in 
order to put an extra man in the 
box, hoping to block the kick. 
It’s the kind of coverage you 
run when you’re the underdog, 
when you need some big, crazy 
plays to win.
Except 
that 
when 
the 
Wolverines lined up again 

and saw Army in the same 
coverage, they were one step 
ahead. Sophomore linebacker 
Michael Barrett — a former 
high-school quarterback who 
contributes mostly on special 
teams — lined up in front of 
punter Will Hart, took a direct 
snap and threw a pass to the 
waiting freshman safety Dax 
Hill, who broke through a 
diving tackle for 25 yards and 
the first down.
Five plays later, Michigan 
tied the game up with a 
touchdown. They went on to 
squeak out a win, 24-21, in 
double overtime.
“Disappointed 
in 
myself. 
I wish I would’ve changed 
the call there,” Monken said. 
“But ... we’re not gonna be 
safe, we’re gonna go play. So if 
I’m safe as a coach, that can’t 
be the way I lead. They gotta 
know I got confidence saying 
we’re gonna go for it. You 
know what? We went for it, got 
a guy out there and we missed 
the tackle.”
Ronnie Bell was sitting on 
the sidelines during the play, 
not knowing what was about 
to 
happen. 
Ben 
Bredeson 
and Aidan Hutchinson were 
equally clueless.
“All of a sudden I see 
everybody 
screaming,” 
Bell 
said. “And I looked and Dax 
made the miss and I was like, 
‘Oh, let’s go,’ so I was excited 
as everybody else.”
Most of the key players 
in the Wolverines’ offense 
don’t play on special teams 
and subsequently had no idea 
it was a play Michigan even 
practiced. But on Saturday, 
it was the reserves and the 
freshmen who pulled out the 
play that brought the drive 
back from the dead.
Monken spent so much time 
dissecting the play because 
he realized that it led to one 
of the Wolverines’ only two 
touchdowns 
of 
regulation. 
The fake punt was a game-
saving play for Michigan, and 
perhaps a season-saving one.
For the Black Knights, it 
was merely the one that got 
away.

Charbonnet becomes workhorse

Michigan’s 
running 
game 
wasn’t supposed to look this 
way.
All 
offseason, 
coaches 
posited that it would be a 
three-headed 
committee. 
When running backs coach Jay 
Harbaugh spoke to the media 
three days before the start of 
the season, he listed five names 
in consideration for touches.
And for one week, reality 
bore that out. Then Saturday 
afternoon arrived. The final 
carry split: Zach Charbonnet, 
33; Christian Turner, 3; Ben 
VanSumeren, 1.
That’s not to say that the 
Wolverines’ 
backfield 
will 
always look this way. After 
the game, Jim Harbaugh said 
that split was a product of 
circumstance. But the truth 
remains: two games into his 
college career, Charbonnet is 
Michigan’s workhorse.
“Full faith in Zach,” said 
senior guard Ben Bredeson. 
“He had a great fall camp, he’s 
doing a great job. Still is, as you 
can see from today. If he’s got 
the ball, we as 
an O-line are 
absolutely fine 
with that.”
At the heart 
of Charbonnet’s 
emergence 
have 
been 
performances 
that 
stand 
in 
direct contrast 
to 
everything 
a 
freshman 
running back is 
supposed to be.
He has run well, to the tune 
of 190 yards on 41 touches — 
4.6 yards per carry. He has 
provided a threat in the passing 
game with four receptions. 
He has punched the ball into 
the end zone when asked to, 
scoring all three of Michigan’s 
touchdowns against Army on 
Saturday.
“You’ve gotta give the kid 
a lot of credit,” Harbaugh 
said Saturday. “He rose to 
the occasion. Had to be tired, 

but did a heck of a job in my 
opinion.”
But 
Christian 
Turner 
— 
bar the touchdowns — has 
done that too, averaging 4.9 
yards per carry and showing a 
dangerous burst to the outside. 
The difference between the two 
has been in pass protection, the 
one area where common sense 
dictates that the sophomore 
Turner’s 
experience 
should 
give him an edge.
In 
week 
one 
against 
Middle Tennessee State, all 
of 
Michigan’s 
presumed 
top 
three backs — 
Charbonnet, 
Turner 
and 
redshirt 
junior 
Tru Wilson — 
were perfect in 
pass protection, 
according 
to 
Harbaugh. And 
the carry split 
followed: 11 for 
Turner, 
eight 
for Charbonnet, two for Wilson 
before he hurt his hand on a 
blitz pickup.
Against 
Army, 
the 
plan 
seemed to follow a similar path 
through two drives. Wilson 
stood on the sideline, dressed 
but not fully healthy, while 
Charbonnet and Turner split 
the early carries. Then, on 
Michigan’s third drive, Turner 
failed to pick up a corner blitz, 
allowing Elijah Riley to force 
Shea Patterson into his second 
fumble of the game.

The rest of the way, Turner 
saw just one carry. Charbonnet 
had 28.
“I just felt like we had to 
really lean on Zach today,” 
Harbaugh said. “(VanSumeren) 
fumbled and we had another 
(Turner) that missed protection 
and we just felt like we just had 
to give it to Zach.”
But 
while 
Charbonnet 
converted 
his 
opportunities 
into 
100 
yards 
and 
three 
touchdowns, 
Harbaugh 
still 
wants 
to 
shy 
away 
from 
overburdening him.
“This next week, that’s going 
to be something that — next 
two weeks, really — getting 
that next back that we can get 
in there and really trust and 
play well,” Harbaugh said. “And 
we’ll evaluate this week to get 
another back in because that’s 
tough duty, going a whole game 
on a hot day.”
The 
issue 
then 
becomes 
which running backs can earn 
that trust. Through two games, 
Turner and sophomore Hassan 
Haskins 
have 
each 
missed 
a vital blitz pickup, while 
VanSumeren’s fumble led to an 
Army touchdown.
Maybe Wilson will fit the 
bill when he returns. His path 
to playing time a year ago was 
pass protection and the blitz 
pickup that he got injured on 
led to a touchdown. But for 
now, Harbaugh has a running 
back he knows he can trust to 
be a workhorse — if he needs 
one.
