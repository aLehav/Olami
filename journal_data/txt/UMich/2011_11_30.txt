System for new
after-hours building
access to take
effect on Jan. 9
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily Staff Reporter
Come January, LSA students
shouldn't leave their Mcards at
home if they want to access cam-
pus buildings after-hours.
The University will complete
its transition to the new Mcard
system on Jan. 9, when after-
hours access to all LSA buildings
will be restricted to students and
faculty who have the new smart
Mcards. The new Mcards can be
identified by the image of a key
on the front of the cards.
Diane Brown, spokeswoman
for the University's Department
of Public Safety, said only stu-
dents, faculty and staff who need
to enter certain buildings after-
hours need to get a new Mcard.
Many people, for example, only
use their Mcards for access
to Ann Arbor Transportation
Authority buses, Brown said.
"If (students) don't have any
need for after-hours access to
academic buildings, then they're
fine with their existing cards,"
Brown said.'If they happen to be

Keg sales
down at A2
stores since
ew tag law

Princeton University Prof. Cornel West speaks about race at Rackham Auditorium yesterday.
West discusses issues
of race in America

In last month,
retailers started
attaching customer
information to kegs
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
State Rep. Mark Meadows
(D-East Lansing) has received
one e-mail since Michigan's keg
tag law took effect Nov. 1.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) has not had to respond
to a single comment from a keg
retailer or a potential buyer -
supportive or critical - over
that time. Neither has Bob West,
assistant city attorney of Ann
Arbor.
But in some Ann Arbor stores
that sell kegs, owners have field-
ed an overload of questions from
customers unaware of the new
law, which mandates that retail-
ers attach tags with customers'
personal information - includ-
ing their state ID numbers - to
all kegs sold. Angry customers
and the loss of sales at some
locations over the past month

have caused some lawmakers to
question the law's effectiveness.
At Strickland's Market on
Geddes Avenue, the drop in keg
sales inthe pastmonthexceeded
owner Eddie Galyana's expec-
tations of a 10-to-15-percent
decline. Galyana said he has sold
about 10 fewer kegs this month
than he did in October, citing
customers' unfamiliarity with
and anxiety about the new law.
"People are still buying, but
they're buying less," Galyana
said. "And when they are buying
they're thinking twice, like, 'I
don't want to give my informa-
tion .. to the state.'"
Galyana added that though
the law has not dissuaded any
customers from buying kegs
while in the store, most have
seemed uncomfortable with the
new purchasing requirements.
At the same time, Galyana sus-
pects some customers have
chosen not to buy kegs due to
unease about the availability of
their information to state offi-
cials. As part of the law, records
of keg sales must be available
for at least one year for police to
inspect at random.

Princeton prof.

By SABIRA KHAN
Daily Staff Reporter
As activist and Princeton
University Prof. Cornel West
told a crowd yesterday, talking

honestly about race isn't easy.
"Things have to get a little
bit different. Things are going
to get a little bit funky," West
told a crowd of about 700 stu-
dents and other University
members gathered in Rack-
ham Auditorium last night.
West - who has written
19 books and has been fea-
tured on CNN and The Col-
bert Report - was invited to
give the opening address of
the 2011 Making Race Heard

Summit, which was spon-
sored by the University's
School of Social Work Student
Union. The event marked the
beginning of a two-day sum-
mit about racial discourse that
will continue on Friday.
In his address, West argued
that discussions about race
are both conversations about
white supremacy and dia-
logues about its effect on the

New coating by'U'researchers
makes 3-D objects look invisible

Carbon nanotube
flattens appearance
of matter
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily StaffReporter
The famous invisibility cloak
of the Harry Potter series may
one day be a reality thanks
to a new object-coating tech-
nique developed by University
researchers.
The coating - a thin layer of
carbon nanotube about half the
thickness of a sheet of paper
- can be applied to objects to

render their three-dimensional
properties invisible. Jay Guo, a
University professor of electri-
cal engineering and computer
science, was the primary inves-
tigator on the study, which was
recently published in thesci-
entific journal Applied Physics
Letters.
Guo explained that the coat-
ing conceals objects in a way
that makes them appear as
black, flat sheets.
"The carbon nanotube layer
is a perfect absorber; it absorbs
all light," he said. "All of the
detailed structures of the object
become invisible."
While the ability of the

carbon nanotube material to
absorb light is well-known
throughout the scientific com-
munity, Guo and his research
team - including Haofei Shi,
a University research fellow of
electrical engineering and com-
puter science, and Rackham
students Hyoung Won Baac and
Jong Ok - discovered the most
efficient way to space the tubes
to achieve the highest degree of
invisibility. The coating's suc-
cess depends on the limitations
of the human eye, Guo said.
"Looking at an object, the
reason you can perceive it is
because of light, (which) is

Student groups could see

The Student Assembly,
MSA's legislative body, passed
a resolution at the MSA meet-

Jewish organization
vies for $10,000 from
local federation
By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
University of Michigan Hillel
is looking to add a new member to
the international community on

campus next year: a fellow from
Israel.
But Hillel has to secure the
funding to sponsor the fellow
first. Hillel is awaiting the deci-
sion of the Jewish Federation of
Ann Arbor on a $10,000 grant
proposal. The fellow would work
for one year on campus and in
the greater Ann Arbor area and
would come from the Jewish
Agency for Israel's Campus Israel

Fellows program.
The Jewish Federation will
finance two grant proposals as
part of its 2012 Impact Fund,
which was started this year to
help finance local projects. Ann
Arbor residents have until today
to vote for two of 23 proposal sub-
missions.

Fifteen University
students in the Ann
Arbor Chess Club are
aiming to revitalize
the perceived drab
game and generate
exciting opportunities
for new members.
The organization
held competitions
between its members
this fall and plans to
enter intercollegiate
tournaments during
the winter semester.
Business School
junior Diana Tabak,
president of the club,
is passionate about
the game and the

club's future potential.
Tabak's parents play
chess so she learned
as a child, and the
campus group offered
her the opportunity to
continue playing.
Tabak said despite
general public opinion,
the game of chess is a
lot of fun.
"No matter how
long you play chess
you can never really
get tired of it because
there's always some-
thing new," she said.
"You can always
improve."
Tabak emphasized

the club's desire to
recruit new members
and the many oppor-
tunities available for
players of all skill lev-
els.
"No matter how
much experience.
you've had with chess
before, you'll be fine,"
Tabak said. "You'll
find somebody who's
at your level, and you'll
be able to win. And if
you want to find some-
body who you'll be los-
ing to, you can do that
too."

Mining co. hopes
to restore order
after protests and
escalating violence
LIMA, Peru (AP) - The own-
ers of a $4.8 billion gold and cop-
per mining project, the biggest
such investment in Peru, said
yesterday they were suspending
it at the government's insistence
following increasingly violent
protests by highlands peasants
who fear for their water supply.
Newmont Mining Corp.
spokesman Omar Jabara told
The Associated Press via email
that the aim is to help restore
public order.
Denver-based Newmont is
the majority owner of the Conga

project, which was to begin
production in 2015 and is an
extension of Yanacocha, Latin
America's biggest gold mine.
Political leaders in Peru's
northern state of Cajamarca
began an open-ended general
strike against the project last
Thursday and violence has been
escalating, including vandalism
and clashes with police.
The Yanacocha consortium,
which includes the Peruvian
company Buenaventura Min-
ing Co. and the International
Finance Corporation, said in a
statement that the suspension
was "required by the Govern-
ment of Peru for the sake of
re-establishing tranquility and
social peace."
Yesterday, at least 20 people
were injured, including eight by
gunfire, in clashes between pro-

testers and police, the region-
al health director, Reynaldo
Nunez, told Canal N. He said
one was in critical condition.
Police said protesters sacked
Conga offices in the town of
Celendin.
Protest leaders said police
fired tear gas and shotgun blasts
at them
Before the suspension
announcement, government
officials continued to insist the
protests did not enjoy wide-
spread support.
"We regret the intransigence
of the leaders who do not want
to engage in dialogue," Inte-
rior Minister Oscar Valdes told
reporters. "We regret that they
are against their own popula-
tion, children who aren't going
to school, dairy farmers who are
losing their milk."

Study: Fewer children in
U. S. lack health insurance

Number of uninsured
children decreases
due to expansion of
Medicaid program
MIAMI (AP) - Even with
more children living in poverty
because of the rough economy,
the number of children without
health insurance in the U.S. has
dropped by 1 million in the past
three years, according to a report
released yesterday by George-
town University.
Many states have expanded
eligibility for, and simplified
access to, the children's Med-
icaid program. This has helped
shrink the number of uninsured
children from 6.9 million in 2008
to 5.9 million in 2010. Experts
say the Affordable Care Act, the
federal health care overhaul
that requires states to maintain
income eligibility levels and dis-
courages other barriers to cover-
age, has played a key role in the
improvement.
Overall, 34 states had a signifi-
cant decrease in the rate of unin-
sured children.
Florida made the most prog-

ress, dropping from 667,758 to
506,934 during that time period,
although the state still has one
of the highest rates of uninsured
children in the nation.
Minnesota, Kansas and Wis-
consin saw an increase in the
number of uninsured children.
Nevada has the highest rate of
uninsured children while Massa-
chusetts has the lowest, accord-
ing to the report.
The findings are based on an
analysis of new health insurance
data from the Census Bureau. It
was done by the Georgetown Uni-
versity Health Policy Institute's
Center for Children and Families.
The news comes as the number
of uninsured adults has risen in
the past few years.
High unemployment rates and
the increasing cost of private
insurance are driving more fami-
lies to the federal-state Medicaid
and Children's Health Insurance
Programs, also known as CHIP.
Both programs provide health
insurance for children, but come
from different funding streams
and allow states more flexibility
in how they run their programs.
President Barack Obama
signed an extension of CHIP
and provided $87 billion to help

states pay for Medicaid in the
2009 economic stimulus, and
experts say a bipartisan national
commitment aimed at cover-
ing children has given states
new tools and incentives to fol-
low through. For example, some
states once required face-to-face
interviews; now many states
have online applications.
The Affordable Care Act
should also help preserve these
gains going forward, said Joan
Alker, co-executive director
of the Georgetown University
research center
"We will move to a culture
of coverage. The presumption
is everyone has insurance," she
said. "Families will feel there's
an option out there for them."
The Supreme Court has
agreed to hear arguments chal-
lenging the constitutionality of
the historic health care overhaul
next year.
Floridaled the nation in reduc-
ing the number of uninsured
children, in part because the
state's Medicaid rolls swelled as
the economy soured. But legisla-
tion passed in 2009 has also sim-
plified the process and reduced
penalties for those who don't pay
premiums.

Proposal could
help heating fund
for poor residents
Michigan House Republi-
cans have a plan to protect low-
income residents from potential
utility shut-offs this winter, their
leaders said yesterday.
Lawmakers announced plans
to put $62 million into the state's
emergency relief fund to help
keep the heat on for low-income
residents. The money would
come from federal funds that
Republicans say could be used
for the heating program.
The plan also would formalize
the end of the collection of a util-
ity charge that ratepayers have
been assessed. A state appeals
court in July struck down the
financing system used by Michi-
gan's Low Income and Energy
Efficiency Fund.
The new legislative plan
would refund the about $40 mil-
lion that had continued to be
collected to affected utility rate-
payers.

staff or faculty ... same thing
goes for them."
LSA is the last school with-
in the University to move to
the new system. The Medical
School has used a system simi-
lar for a number of years, and
College of Engineering build-
ings on North Campus have
operated on the system for
about a year.
Brown said the new Mcard
system is hardest to implement
for LSA buildings because so
many people who aren't affili-
ated with LSA use the school's
facilitates.
On Sept. 7, students received
an e-mail encouraging them to
trade in their Mcards before
Nov. 1. The notice also indicat-
ed that extra locations to trade
in Mcards would open tempo-
rarily to quicken the exchange
process. Despite the Nov. 1
deadline, students, faculty and
staff can still exchange their
old Mcards for news ones,
accordingto Brown.
The Michigan Daily could
not obtain the number of peo-
ple who have already gotten

new Mcards as of last night.
Under the new system,
buildings will be open to the
public until 6 p.m. Between 6
p.m. and 10 p.m., the buildings
will only be accessible to those
with new Mcards, Brown said.
After 10 p.m., buildings will
be closed to those without
special access, which includes
people who are members of
certain organizations that use
the facilities. There are some
exceptions to these hours, like
buildings that have computer
labs, accordingto Brown.
Business junior Nikhil
Kulkarni exchanged his
Mcard to make it more conve-
nient when entering buildings.
"This way, now I can get
into the buildings after hours,"
Kulkarni said. "I don't have
to always walk around to the
entrances that are open."
LSA sophomore Tanika
Raychaudhuri also got the
new Mcard so she could easily
access the buildings.
"I just did because they sent
out an e-mail sayingthatif you
didn't it might be hard to get
into certain University build-
ings at night," Raychaudhuri
said. "I thought it might be
good just to get it changed."

Since new law, some stores
see increased sales of liquor

From Page1A
Galyana added that beer case
and liquor sales have risen by 5
percent over the last month at
the store, in accordance with his
prediction last month that cus-
tomers would alternatively buy
cases of beer or liquor as an alter-
native to kegs.
Other local keg retailers have
seen less of a decline in keg sales.
Sunny Bhagat, owner of Blue
Front Kegs on Packard Street,
said he could not tell if his keg
sales declined from October to
November. However, he said
many of his customers knew of
the law's implementation before
coming in to buy a keg. In fact,
Bhagat found out about the law
when three or four of his cus-
tomers told him they read about
it in the newspaper.
"It doesn't make a differ-
ence to them," Bhagat said, add-

ing that most of his customers
haven't reacted negatively when
filling out the tags.
The store's unchanging sales
of beer cases - which, Bhagat
noted, cost more per amount
of beer than kegs - since last
month also obscured whether
the law has had any effect on keg
sales, he said. And though beer
keg sales in Bhagat's store this
November are down 50 percent
from last November's numbers,
he said part of this is due to the
failing economy and fewer home
football games this month.
"It fluctuates because of the
games and finals," Bhagat said.
Skeptics of the law pointed to
the difficulty of enforcement as
one reason the law would not be
effective on preventing minors
from gaining access to alcohol.
Irwin said he has always thought
the law would not achieve the
cultural changes necessary to

eliminate underage drinking.
"It's already plenty illegal
to buy alcohol as an underage
person or to provide alcohol to
an underage person, so I'm not
sure how this law is going to
change that or make it any more
intense," he said.
However, Irwin acknowl-
edged, like Meadows and Bhagat,
that one month not enough time
to project the law's impact.
"If we were able to check back
in on this in a year and find out
what really happened, we might
have a better idea of whether this
was a bona fide effort to really
reduce underage drinking or just
an opportunity for some folks to
take credit for doing something
about underage drinking," he
said. "I suspect that we'll look
back and determine that the lat-
ter of the two choices was right
... but I'm open to being proven
wrong."



WASHINGTON INVISIBLE
House votes to ease From Page 1A

airport screening
for military
The House yesterday voted
unanimously to allow military
travelers on official duty to get
a special preference to move
through airport security checks
faster.
The bill, approved 404-0,
would give the Homeland Secu-
rity Department six months to
devise a preference system for
the Armed Forces. The legisla-
tion went to the Senate.
If the bill becomes law, the
earliest beneficiaries would
likely be troops returning from
Afghanistan next year and their
family members, who also would
receive preferential treatment.

Iranian protesters
Hard-line Iranian protest-
ers stormed British diplomatic
compounds yesterday, hauling
down the Union Jack, torching
an embassy vehicle and pelting
buildings with petrol bombs in
what began as an apparent state-
approved show of anger over the
latest Western sanctions to pun-
ish Tehran for defiance over its
nuclear program.
The hours-long assault on
the British Embassy and a resi-
dential complex for staff - in
chaotic scenes reminiscent of
the seizing of the U.S. Embassy
in 1979 - could push already
frayed diplomatic ties toward
the breaking point.
Iran's parliament approved a
bill Sunday to downgrade rela-
tions with Britain, one of Ameri-
ca's closest allies with diplomatic
envoys in the Islamic Republic.

Behring Breivik belongs in psy-

Norwegian prosecutors said yes-

declared him legally insane dur-
ing a bomb-and-shooting ram-

The court-ordered assessment
found that the self-styled anti-
Muslim militant was psychotic
during the July 22 attacks, which
would make him mentally unfit
to be convicted and imprisoned
for the country's worst peace-
time massacre.
The report, written by two
psychiatrists who spent 36
hours talking to Breivik, will
be reviewed by an expert panel
before the Oslo district court
rules on his mental state didn't
have enough evidence to justifiy

there's no light coming into
your eyes, then things become
unperceivable."
However, unlike the magi-
cal cloaks used by fictional
wizards, Guo said the coating
can't completely hide an object
because it can't conceal the
object's shadow. Acoated object
must be placed against a dark
background to become com-
pletely invisible.
The carbon nanotube could
potentially be used by the

military for national security
purposes, like concealing an
airplane against the night sky,
according to Guo.
Guo's curiosity about objects
and their visibility extends to
the study of space. He said he
is particularly intrigued by
the properties of dark mat-
ter - invisible space matter
that accounts for much of the
universe's mass and may have
similar properties to the carbon
nanotubes.
Guo hypothesizes that the
coating could potentially cover
extremely large objects like
planets.
"It's certainly possible to hide
an object of that size," he said.

parency.
Speaker of the Assembly
Matthew Eral said some MSA
members were uncomfortable
that such a large transfer could
be made by the finance commit-
tee without the entire assem-
bly's input.
"There does need to be more
legislative oversight for the
transfer of funds that large,"
Watson said.
Watson said he expects Eral
to write a resolution creating
more legislative oversight for
financial issues, which he said
he will support.
The transfer was deemed
necessary by the Finance Com-
mittee because student organi-
zations requested more money
than expected during the first
and second cycles of funding
this semester. The current sys-
tem has three cycles during
which student organizations
can apply for funding.
The three funding applica-
tion due dates for this year are
Sept. 30, Oct. 28 and Dec. 2.
Because so much funding was
allocated during the first two
cycles, the Student Organiza-
tion Funding Commission had
less money than usual for the
third cycle.
However, this financing sys-

tem for student organizations
won't be in place much longer.
After Jan. 1, MSA will employ a
new funding method in which
student organizations won't
need to wait for a new cycle
to apply for funding, but can
instead do so based on need.
This semester, Watson and
MSA Vice President Brendan
Campbell have been working
independently of the Student
Assembly to implement the new
system.
"Brendan and I actually ran
on the promise that we were
(goingto) change funding, part-
ly because it doesn't really work
for student orgs," Watson said.
Watson said many student
organizations form at the end of
cycles or don't plan far enough
ahead, making it difficult to
receive funding from the current
system. Watson added that MSA
will have abetterunderstanding
of how much funding organiza-
tions are requesting and will be
able to allocate funds more accu-
rately in the future.
"Essentially, we're making
more funding available to stu-
dent orgs without increasing
the actual amount of money
we're using, which I think is
beautiful," Watson said.
He added that the delay in the
system's implementation is due
to unresolved MSA administra-
tion issues, but he is confident in
the new method's effectiveness.

groups perceive things.
"Anytime you talk about race,
you're not just talking about
semantic facts, you're talk-
ing about the legacy of white
supremacy that has convinced
people of color that they're less
beautiful, less intelligent and
less human. And they believed
it," West said.
He added that the summit is
intended to draw attention to
racial issues, even if these issues
engender discomfort.
"When you're talking about
making race heard, you're going
to hear some things you're not
used to hearing," West said.
But according to West, every-
one is interconnected and inter-
dependent.
"I believe even the people in
the crack houses are our broth-
ers and sisters because they can
bounce back," West said. "Mal-

would have experience with both
Israeli and American culture.
"We are looking for an educa-
tor who can facilitate informal ...
learning opportunities that will
strengthen students' relationship
with Israel and enhance their
overall college experience," Rosen
wrote.
According to Hillel's proposal,
6,000 University students identify
as Jewish. In 2011, 326 University
students participated in Taglit-
Birthright Israel - a program
that allows Jewish students to
travel to Israel for 10 days free
of charge. This number was the
most of any participating institu-
tion.
Because many University stu-
dents participate in Taglit-Birth-
right Israel, having an Israeli

students before and after partici-
pating in the trip would improve
the program, Rosen wrote.

West also told audience mem-
bers to keep abreast of interna-
tional developments.
"Keep track of what is going
on in Africa with the elections
in Cairo .." he said. "Watch,
because our destiny is strictly
tied to theirs on a global level."
West concluded by discussing
the racial disparity in drug con-
victions in the United States.
"Young black people take 13
percent of drugs, white brothers
and sisters take 13 percent of the
drugs, young black folks are 62
percent of drug convictions," he
said. "But we're not supposed to
talk about this. We need to tell
the truth now."
According to West, President
Barack Obama any complicates
discussions about race.
"I love Barack Obama, but
he profoundly confuses things
because it leads people to think,
'How can the black folks pos-
sibly be upset when we have a
black president sitting in a white
house?' But that is progress. I
won't deny that."
West ended his presentation
by saying that civil rights icons
like Martin Luther King Jr. and
"We have a responsibility to fol-
low up on (Taglit-Birthright Israel
students') experiences in a deeply
meaningful way, and we think a

The fellow would also devote
20 percent of his or her time to
work with the greater Ann Arbor
Jewish population, according to
Rosen.
LSA senior Naomi Scheiner-
man, who serves as Israel chair
on Hillel's programming board,
said the fellow would be a "sha-
liah" - which means messenger in
Hebrew - for students.

Malcolm X were driven by love.
"The love of Martin was so
deep for the country, for poor
people, for working people, for
Vietnamese babies," he said. "It
was so profound, people couldn't
take it, you had to kill him. Mal-
colm X was the same way. Their
love wasn't a play thing."
School of Education senior
Christian Little said West's pre-
sentation resonated with her.
With plans to work for Teach for
America next year, she lauded
West's speech.
"I thought it was absolutely
inspiring," Little said. "I'm really
about education revolution, and
what he was saying about loving
someone to the point that it is col-
orblind is just really amazing."
LSA senior Garrett Johnson,
who is studying history, said
West's speech shed light on criti-
cal issues such as oppression and
inequity.
"There's incredible social
inequality, much of (which is)
structural and based on histori-
cal precedence," Johnson said.
"... It's something that needs to
be discussed and made known to
as many people as possible as it
has begun to be."
"There are a bunch of Israe-
lis on campus, but having a pro-
fessional Israeli perspective on
campus adds to the diversity and
multiculturalism (of the Univer-
sity)," Scheinerman said.
She added thatthe fellow would
also bring valuable political expe-
rience to share with members of
the campus community.
"Having someone who is Israeli
here will prove beneficial to have
an informed perspective (on the
Arab-Israeli conflict)," Scheiner-
man said. "From a political per-
spective, it's important to hear
from firsthand experience."

Attend to attendance
DPS must address underlying causes of truancy
R oy Roberts, Detroit Public Schools emergency manager,
recently announced that the district's deficit is less than
$100 million, a decrease of $43 million in the last fiscal year.
But for every step DPS takes, it is forced to take two more back. The
positive news for Michigan's largest school district comes at the
same time as a threat of a $25.9 million fine due to attendance below
state standards. Detroit schools should be given the opportunity to
address the underlying causes of truancy instead of being fined - a
practice that could exacerbate financial problems and hinder the

educational system.
According to The Detroit News, DPS atten-
dance was below the state-mandated 75 per-
cent of the school's student body on 46 days
last school year. In contrast, Utica Community
Schools and Dearborn Public Schools - Michi-
gan's second and third largest school districts
respectively- neverreached attendancebelow
75 percent last school year. A total of $680,000
in truancy fines was paid by DPS for the 2009-
2010 school year, and officials expect to pay
only a fraction of the $25.9 million estimate
this year.
The Michigan Department of Education
deducts fines from districts' state aid based
on how far attendance is below the 75 percent
mark. Last year, average school attendance at
DPS on Fridays was 71.2 percent. Though aver-
age attendance was above 75 percent Monday
through Thursday, it was always below 80 per-
cent. Veterans Day.was a half-school day for
the district, and DPS only recorded 50.7 per-
cent student attendance - one of many half-
days cited for excessive absences.
While the attendance fines are problem-
atic, the actual truancy is a larger concern.
Attendance percentages in the mid-70s can-
not sustain an educational system. According
to the National Center for School Engagement,
experts have linked truancy with delinquency
and dropping out of school. Students need to
regularly attend classes in order to benefit from
their education and prepare for their futures.
There are better ways to address truancy
problems than limiting schools' financial

resources. It's difficult to rationalize allocation
of funds for absent students. However, cut-
ting funding puts schools at a disadvantage
to educate students. The fines also become
punishments to students who are consistently
attending school, since they suffer from fund-
ingcuts.
With class sizes increasing, few of Detroit's
teachers have the resources or time to follow
up on absent students. The most important way
DPS can address low attendance is to promote
parent involvement. Parents should ensure
that their children get to school each day and
should notify teachers regarding absences and
DPS should continue to increase communica-
tion with parents.
Schools can incentivize attendance through
programs like Count Me In! - a before-school
club that offers prizes to students with perfect
attendance - and establish consequences for
poor attendance. DPS should set achievable
goals and encourage good record-keeping and
continual evaluation to foster teacher involve-
ment.
Already this year, DPS has seen improve-
ment through enhanced parent communica-
tion programs. The attendance rate for the
fifth day of school was 85 percent, compared
to 69 percent in 2010, according to a report
released by DPS. Attendance must remain
a primary focus to ensure a better future for
Detroit's students, but the district needs the
opportunity to work on these issues before its
funding is cut.

Despite rivalry, 'U' fans
must remain respectful
TO THE DAILY:
As a graduate student and avid Michigan
fan, I feel saddened but compelled to write
about the behavior of some University stu-
dents at last Saturday's football game. Uni-
versity's students were heckling, screaming
profanities incessantly and cheering when
the Ohio State University players were
injured on the field. Furthermore, I brought
my wife-to-be (an OSU graduate) to the game

and witnessed her getting pushed by one
University student fan after the game with-
out any provocation.
I understand that this is a huge rivalry,
but it is also unacceptable and extremely
disrespectful. If any of us experienced this
treatment in Columbus, we would imme-
diately castigate the entire OSU commu-
nity. We should hold ourselves to a higher
standard, and let our academic and athletic
achievements speak for themselves. We are,
after all, Michigan.
Srinivas Parinandi

This policy won't just hurt the 4
auto industry, it will affect consum-
ers as well. The price of a new car
will increase by an estimated $3,100
- making it much harder for low-
income households to afford.
So, once again, the line in the sand
has been drawn between the envi-
ronment and the economy with no
clear way to please both sides. The
key factor in this debate will come
down to the consumer. American
consumers have the power to ease
the worries of auto companies by
stepping up and buying hybrids. A
boost in sales could help to ensure
the 54.5 mpg goal is met on schedule
without jeopardizing the American
auto industry's future. If consumers
remain content with their less effi-4
cient vehicles, auto makers will be
stuck with a surplus of cars no one
wants and will have to struggle to
stay out of the red. The culmination
of this argument is simple: Uncle
Sam wants YOU to drive a hybrid.

the film itself
- the so-called Paramount
"immersion"
left viewers feeling violated and
disenchanted. It seems prudent
that a filmmaking legend would
show the world how to make a
3-D movie. And Martin Scors-
ese ("The Departed"), the fur-
ry-eyed maestro, has answered
with his first children's movie,
."Hugo."
It's clear from the opening - a
long continuous shot that is pure
"Scorsese" - this film's use of
3-D was premeditated, unlike so
many post-conversion produc-
tions (see "Clash of the Titans").
As the audience is invited into
the world of Hugo Cabret (Asa
Butterfield, "Nanny McPhee and
the Big Bang"), the camera moves
through throngs of people, mak-
ing the viewer feel so very small
and helpless. It climbs catwalks
and clock towers as drifts of snow
and plumes of steam literally bil-
low in the audience's faces.
While "Hugo" is a technologi-
cal marvel, it's still a Scorsese pic-

ture at heart. The great filmmaker
once said his true interests in his
craft were stories and characters.
His love for both has never been
more apparent than in this film.
Living secretly in the walls of
a Parisian railway station, Hugo
steals spare partsto fix an autom-
aton his deceased father never
finished - but alas, no parts will
do. He shares this dream with a
girl named Isabelle (Chloe Grace
Moretz, "Kick-Ass"), a bubbly
and precocious wordsmith who
also lost her parents.
In addition to the duo, the
secondary characters color each
scene with comic relief and sub-
stance. Like Hugo and Isabelle,
they possess a gooey vulnerabil-
ity that none would like to admit
to. Wounded from the Great War,
Sacha Baron Cohen's ("Bruno")
Inspector Gustav drags his leg in
a brace and admires a flower shop
girl, always at a distance (which
the 3-D beautifully captures),
afraid his deformity doesn't
make him "man" enough for her.
Gustav is the antagonist, but it's
hard not toslove him. , K -
But the most important char-
acter to Hugo (and the film) is
none other than the real-life film
visionary Georges Melies ("A Trip
to the Moon"); a man known as
the world's first cinemagician for
his ability to transform reality on
the silver screen. To Hugo and
Isabelle, he is Papa Georges (Ben
Kingsley, "Gandhi"), a frank toy
shop owner in the railway station.
After Papa Georges is revealed,
it's clear this film tackles much
more than the cute story of an
orphan named Hugo.
Ultimately, this is the closest
Scorsese has come to blending
his life and journey as an artist

with his work. As an asthmatic
boy in Little Italy, he was seques-
tered from the world outside. He
observed people, how they inter-
acted, why they did things - it's
actually how "Goodfellas" came
about.
Like the director, Hugo is an
alienated observer who desper-
ately wants a place in society. He
fixes machines to give them their
purpose, but more than anything
he wants to fix himself. In doing
so, however, he heals the heart of
an old man - George Melies.
Scorsese's life's passion is cine-
ma. One of the underlying themes
of "Hugo" is film preservation,
an issue the Oscar winner has
spearheaded, and he treats this
topic with honesty and care. The
background may be filled with
visual sparkle, but the foreground
always belongs to the characters
he crafts. Butterfield pierces the
screen with his eyes. Moretz is
charming, and her transforma-
tion from the foul-mouthed mini-
hero in "Kick-Ass" to Hugo's
only friend is astounding. As for
Kingsley, Scorsese allows him to
to fill the screen with emotion.
If Melies were alive, he would've
been honored.
With this tour-de-force in 3-D
filmmaking, Scorsese asks his
audiences to embrace this new
form of storytelling. With this
magical cinema love letter, he
reminds the world why films are
so important. With this tale of an
orphan boy, a broken old man, a
lively wordsmith and a hilarious
railway inspector, he reaffirms a
faith in humanity and filmmaking
that should never be forgotten.
Mr. Martin Scorsese: For
your salute to George Melies, we
salute you.

Michigan band
Breathe Owl Breathe
comes to Ann Arbor
By EDITH FREYER
Daily Arts Writer
Tonight, Breathe Owl Breathe
will soar into Ann Arbor to play
an evening show at Arbor Vitae,
and the band
is bringing an Breathe Owl
unconventional
attitude toward Breathe
music. The Tonight at
East Jordan, 8p.m.
Mich. trio, who

rating in 2004, From $8
have a passion
for blurring the lines between a
variety of artistic disciplines to
culminate in unusual live perfor-
mances.
Breathe Owl Breathe has an
eclectic palette in its member
composition and audio output.
Micah Middaugh, the band's
lead singer, is a skilled print-
maker who operates his own art
studio. Andrea Moreno-Beals
is a classically trained cellist
and budding embroidery art-
ist, while Trevor Hobbs teaches
online physical geography, hav-
ing obtained a master's degree
from Michigan State University.
A diverse bunch to be sure, their
appreciation for variety burns
brightest in the music they
make.
"Sometimes we're called to-fi
indie folk - just using differ-
ent methods for making sounds
and performing with instru-

ments that are in various states
of decay," said Trevor Hobbs,
the group's drummer. "We have
a folk element to it, because we
have cello and acoustic guitar
and drums, but we're kind of
mixing in all sorts of other differ-
ent kinds of sounds, both digital
and acoustic these days."
The band often writes and
records at a remote Michigan
cabin belonging to Middaugh's
family.
"It's a place where we cannot
necessarily block out the world,
but just create in the ways that we
want to, which is really impor-
tant to us," Hobbs said.
More specifically, the band-
mates are interested in eventu-
ally developing themselves as
producers of their own art and
music, handling every aspect of
creation and publication. They've
already created audio-visual chil-
dren's books and would like to
make a practice of creating live
shows in diverse spaces.
"We're really focused on ori-
enting ourselves so that every-
thing we do is coming out of our
own little ship - our own little
vessel," Hobbs said.
Breathe Owl Breathe's music
envelops a subtle classical influ-
ence, which Hobbs describes as
not only a result of the group's
long history with music, but also
an overwhelming passion for its
different forms.
"We have that deeper founda-
tionbutalot of it comes from just
appreciating more and more how
songs are arranged and wanting
to approach our own music with
that in mind," Hobbs said.
Meanwhile, the group is

increasingly grateful for the
opportunity to travel around the
world - Breathe Owl Breathe
recently played in Ireland - and
share its creative message. Hobbs
described Breathe Owl Breathe's
live shows as unplanned and cre-
ated by spontaneous decisions
based on each location and crowd.
"We may play new songs and
we may not," Hobbs said. "We get
to the venue and we check in and
see how everybody's feeling about
what works well and what doesn't
work. We like to mix it up."
The band is currently touring
with longtime friend and Cali-
fornia-based musician Kyle Field,
who performs under the moniker
Little Wings. This tour marks
Field's first foray on Michigan
soil, an event Hobbs said is a long
time coming.
"We're really excited to show
him around to all the different
places that are so important to us
and have been a part of our own
story," he said.
Though Breathe Owl Breathe
has played Arbor Vitae a couple of
times before, Ann Arborites still
may not know what to expect at
tonight's show. But it's sure to be
a distinctive mark of creativity, as
Hobbs and his bandmates have a
deep enthusiasm for their perfor-
mances.
"(The best part is) getting to
the place where you don't feel
like there's a filter at all between
the deepest parts of yourself and
what comes out to the audience,"
Hobbs said.
"It comes and goes unexpect-
edly -you never know how you're
going to feel - but when you feel
good, it's really rewarding."

from seeing people communi-

The shows will feature a fili-

Robinson settles into 'makeshift' offense

Square-peg
quarterback and
round-hole offense
find happy medium
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
At the beginning of the season,
offensive coordinator Al Borges
said he wasn't going to make the
Michigan football team's offense
a round hole for a square peg in
junior quarterback Denard Rob-
inson. After nearly three months
of adjusting, the sentiment finally
rang true.
But it took some whittling of
that square peg. Robinson had to
improve his footwork and make
better decisions, like scrambling
instead of trying to force throws.
It also took a bit of hole-widening.
Borges has created what Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke called a
"makeshift" offense, mixing ele-
ments of both the West Coast and
spread offenses.
Whatever it is, there's no argu-
ing with the results. Robinson
accounted for nine touchdowns
in the team's final two games. His
quarterback rating against Ohio
State was an astounding 223.1
after tossing just three incomple-
tions and no interceptions. He

Michigan prepares for
fast-paced Terrapins in
Big Ten/ACC challenge

JED MOCH/Daily
Fifth-year senior goaltender Shawn Hunwick and the Michigan hockey team have allowed more goals in the past six games than they did in their previous 12 games.
Hunwick, defense look for answers
after allowing 23 goals in six games

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
It's easy for players on the
Michigan hockey team to start
pointing fingers as the program
endures its longest losing streak
since the 1998-99 season. Maybe
one line isn't pulling its weight or
a special teams unit has started
to slack.
But for the Wolverines, the
problem is clear.
Over the last six games, No.
19 Michigan (3-5-2 CCHA, 7-7-2
overall) has given up 23 goals.
Before the losing streak started,
the Wolverines had allowed just
20 goals over 12 games.
Michigan's scoring has been
inconsistent at times this sea-
son, but doubling a season total
of goals allowed over the span of
six games won't help a team win
many games, no matter what the
offense is doing.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
was particularly disappointed
after a pair of losses last week-
end, a 4-1 loss to Northeastern
and a 6-3 loss to Union.
"We are only good if our goals
against are down," Berenson
said. "We give up 10 goals against
over two games? How can you
feel good about that at home?
That's a team issue that starts
with goalies, but it's defense and
forwards too. It's everyone."
When that many goals are

allowed, the first player to con-
sider is the goaltender. Fifth-year
senior Shawn Hunwick entered
the season as the unquestioned
starter for the first time in his
career, and he sure looked the
part when he shut out Niagara in
the season opener.
His full impact was felt in the
season's first road series against
Northern Michigan, when he
was ejected for fighting. Backup
sophomore goaltender Adam
Janecyk was forced into the
game and didn't stand a chance,
allowing four goals in a 5-3 Mich-
igan loss.
The next night, Hunwick
stopped all three shots ina shoot-
out victory over the Wildcats.
The goalie has been Hunwick
all year, and presumably, it will
continue to be Hunwick all year.
But he admitted the last cou-
ple of weeks might be the worst
stretch of his career at any level,
and at times, that has been obvi-
ous. He hasn't played all too
poorly, but he also hasn't played
like the Shawn Hunwick - one of
the best goaltenders in the nation
- that Michigan fans are accus-
tomed to.
"I need to get back to worry-
ing about myself," Hunwick said.
"Maybe I need to start being a
little selfish.... Sometimes I think
about the team too much and I
just need to worry about myself.
If I am not doing my job, I'm not

Wednesday.
This is the first true test for
Michigan, which has yet to
face a ranked opponent all sea-
son. The Wolverines' toughest
win came against Florida in
their season opener, when thoy
pulled out a three-point victory
on the road.
Loading Michigan into Col-
logo Park, Md. is senior guard
Courtney Boylan, who aver-
ages 15 points and five rebounds
per game, and junior forward
Rachel Sheffer, who averages
11.6 points per game. Junior
guard Jenny Ryan is coming off
an excellent tournament per-
formance in the Virgin Islands,
posting a double-double against
Marquette. She currently leads
the team with six rebounds per
game.
Rebounding has been a huge
focus for the Wolverines this
season, and it's a big reason
for their early season success.
So far, Michigan is averaging
roughly six more rebounds per
game than it did last season.
"Rebounding has been the
biggest significant change in
what we've done in the past four
years," said Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth. "Our perspec-
tive on rebounding has changed
- we block out. We spend every
day blocking out."
Michigan has outrebounded
its opponents in five of its seven
games this year. Against Mary-
land, the Wolverines will have
their work cut out for them on
the boards.
It's what the Terrapins are
known for.
This season, Maryland is
averaging 20 more rebounds
a game than its opponents.
Tianna Hawkins, a 6-foot-3
junior forward, leads the team
in rebounding with 10 per

game. Michigan will look to
limit Hawkins and Maryland's
seven other 6-foot players on
the boards to stay competitive.
"I think it's going to be the
rebounding battle that will be
the deciding factor," Ryan said.
"They get offensive rebounds,
that's what Maryland is known
for. Our ability to negate that
and cut down their rebounds
makes our chances that much
better. If you look at the stats at
the end of the game, whichever
way (rebounding) goes will be a
big factor."
Borseth said that limit-
ing Maryland's offensive and
defensive rebounds will be a
way to keep the score close.
"They want to put every-
thing down around the basket,"
Borseth said. "They want to
rebound, they want to get down
the court, shoot it and send five
people to the offensive glass
and get it, and they can pretty
much doit every time they want
to."
Maryland is seventh in the
nation in points per game and
scored 114 points in its last
game against California State
Bakersfield. And a lot of its bas-
kets came off second-chance
opportunities - the team aver-
ages 16.3 offensive rebounds per
game. This has allowed the Ter-
rapins to use the clock to extend
their offensive possessions and
wear out an opponent's defense.
The Wolverines will look to
contain the Terrapins' shooting
and focus on improving their
shot selection, as well.
"It's definitely going to be on
our end to minimize (scoring),"
Ryan said.
"Since they are such a high
scoring team and that's what
they're known for, at the same
time, we're going to have to
score. It's not going to be one of
these games when you can get
away with scoring SO points.
We're going to have to be solid
on both ends of the floor."
Michigan's offense will need
to help out its defense by taking
smart shots and utilizing pos-
sessions to its advantage.
"If we make a shot, they have
to take it out of bounds and
that eliminates their transition
game," Ryan said.
"And that's going to be a
major thing, using the shot
clock to our advantage to mini-
mize their possessions and
make the most out of our pos-
sessions."

Stingy Virginia defense hands 'M' road loss

4

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
Charlottesville, Va. - Last
night's Big Ten/ACC Challenge
duel against Virginia had the signs
of a letdown game for the No. 15
Michigan basketball team.
The Wol- MICHIGAN 58
verines (5-2) VIRGINIA 70
were com-
ing off a suc-
cessful trip to Hawaii at the Maui
Invitational and were playing in
their first true road contest of the
season. They had been playing
beyond expectations and were
bound to fall back to Earth.
And unfortunately for Michi-
gan, the signs held true.
The Wolverines had trouble
stringing together effective
offensive possessions, and they
had no answer for a second-
half Cavalier run and a stingy
defense, in a 70-58 loss.
"They're one of the better
defensive teams we'll play all
year," said senior guard Zack
Novak. "They did a good job. At
the end of the day though, we just
got some shots we had to make.
In the first half we missed a cou-

ple bunnies and in the second
half ... we pushed things a little
bit but couldn't geta bucket."
The early going of the game
marked a departure from what
the Wolverines were used to last
week.
At the Maui Invitational,
Michigan put up a lot of points
to keep up with the pace of Mem-
phis, Duke and UCLA. But things
slowed back down when the
Wolverines touched down in the
mainland. Long possessions, few
fast breaks and staunch defense
kept the score low, as neither
team found much rhythm on
offense early.
The Wolverines led 19-14 with
less than three minutes left in the
first half when Cavalier guard
Joe Harris injected some life
into the game. He knocked down
a 3-pointer, forced a steal and
knocked down two free throws
to send Virginia (6-1) on an 10-4
run. The Cavaliers went into the
locker room leading, 24-23.
"That was really big," Novak
said of the run. "It looks like
we're going to go in with a bit of a
lead, we're on the line, but you've
just got to work through those

After the break, the scoring
picked up. The Cavaliers and
the Wolverines traded leads, but
neither team could separate itself
until the middle of the half. That's
when Virginia pounced with a
15-0 run, and Michigan couldn't
respond. The crowd at John Paul
Jones Arena grew louder and the
Wolverines had trouble finding
any semblance of an offensive
rhythm. Beilein called two time-
outs during the Cavalier streak,
but neither helped.
"We wanted to make sure they
calmed down and got a good
shot," Beilein said. "At that time,
you don't give them a big plan.
There's not a big change other
than 'Alright, settle down. You're
alright. And we've got to guard at
one end and execute at the other.'
You give them two plays."
The Wolverines didn't find suc-
cess with either one.
Michigan missed 10-straight
shots until sophomore guard Tim
Hardaway Jr. finally hit a jump
shot to end the suffering. At that
point, Virginia was up 53-43.
"As long as (Tony Bennett) is
coaching this team, (the defense)
is always goingto be good," Beilein

said. "Theydo atremendous job....
They're tough to get easy baskets
and when you get them, you can't
miss them, and we had several of
those in the game."
Harris and forward Mike Scott
had the hot hands for the Cava-
liers, scoring 18 points apiece as
Virginiasent Michiganhome with
few positives. The Cavalier scor-
ing was limited to just five players,
but it was enough.
Virginia evened up its all-time
series with Michigan at 2-2;
Hardaway Jr. spent much of the
first half on the bench after pick-
ing up his second foul minutes into
the game. He didn't score his first
points until that run-ending bas-
ket midway through the second
half, finishing with a season-low
five points.
Novak, freshman point guard
Trey Burke and sophomore for-
ward Evan Smotrycz took the
burden of the scoring in the
game, but it was far too little to
give Michigan a chance to win.
"We just have to learn from
our mistakes and come back Sat-
urday (against Iowa State) with a
different mentality," Hardaway
Jr. said.

Added Michigan coach John
Beilein: "We got ourselves in
foul trouble a little bit and that
certainly hurt our first-half per-

formance. I felt we missed some
easy ones in the first half. We had
foul trouble in the first half (and)
probably could have got out on

if it helps us win the game the

Charlottesville, Va. -
Deciphering Michigan's
70-58 road loss to Vir-
ginia
last night is a
game of elimi-
nation.
So let's play. a
Did
Michigan lose
because of
poor shoot-
ing? No. The LUCAS
Wolverines PASCH
shot 44 per-
cent from the
field and a blistering 45.5 per-
cent from behind the arc. Their
10 3-pointers were actually the
most the team has hit in a game
all season.
Some of those points came off
desperation 3-pointers toward
the end of the game, but it was

still encouraging for Michigan
coach John Beilein to see play-
ers not named Tim Hardaway Jr.
knocking down shots.
Was Virginia's unique pack-
line defense too much to handle?
Maybe in the first half, but
Michigan still finished with an
acceptable 58 points. The Cava-
liers entered the game second
in the nation in scoring defense,
allowing just 45.3 points per
game.
Beilein said after the game
that he thought his team was
poised on the offensive end.
"I'm not crazy about scoring
58 points," Beilein said. "But not
a lot of teams may score 58 points
against them. Thank goodness
we made some threes to be able
to do that, but they're tough to
get easy baskets (against)."
Did point guard Trey Burke

cave under the pressure of play-
ing in the first truly hostile envi-
ronment of his career? Not so
much. The freshman didn't shoot
as well as he usually does, but he
still finished with 11 points and
made some dazzling drives to
the rim.
In fact, the offense stagnated
when Beilein decided to give
Burke a couple minutes of rest
midway through the second half.
That may not be the only reason
Virginia went on a 15-0 run, but
it does seem that the Michigan
offense presents a more poised
attack when Burke runs the
point.
And outside of one play early
in the first half when Virginia's
Jontel Evans crossed up Burke
on a highlight-worthy drive to
the hoop, Burke's on-ball defense
was solid.
Was the loss due to a lack of
post presence? Not really. For-
wards Jordan Morgan and Jon
Horford didn't play particu-
larly well, but they didn't get
a whole lot of minutes, either.
Beilein's offensive game plan
consisted of guards shoot-
ing from the perimeter and
cutting into the lane, partly
because Cavalier forward
Mike Scott and center Assane
Sene are great at limiting
opposing big men.
Did Hardaway Jr.'s lack of
production hurt Michigan?

Sure, but it wasn't the key factor
in Michigan's loss. It definitely
hurt when Hardaway Jr. took
the bench because of foul trouble
just five minutes into the contest,
but the Wolverines were still
shooting the ball at a prolific
rate.
And when Hardaway Jr. was
in the game, his drives to the
basket were sloppy and resulted
in a couple of turnovers.
Did Michigan lose because
of Virginia's domination of the
glass?
Yes - an emphatic yes.
The Cavaliers finished the
game with 36 rebounds, com-
pared to just 26 for the Wolver-
ines. Worse yet, 10 of Virginia's
boards came on the offensive
end. On a couple of possessions,
the Cavaliers would get second
and third chances before scoring.
And when Michigan shot the
ball, it was hard to count how
many times there were only
white and orange jerseys crash-
ing the boards, without even a
hint of maize in the scrum. It
was as if Beilein had all five guys
retreating to play transition
defense on every possession. And
because of it, the Wolverines
snatched just three offensive
rebounds.
Sure, the reboundingtrouble
was partly because Michigan's
bigs didn't see the floor the whole
night. But there almost seemed to

be a total lack of effort.
At least the team realized it.
Everyone from the young Burke
to senior co-captain Zack Novak,
was quick to note the rebound
disparity in the locker room after
the game.
"I think the big thing is
rebounding," Novak said. "I'm

goingto guess we had fewer pos-
sessions (than usual) this game."
Novak guessed right - and
for the Wolverines, that spelled
a loss.

not vocalize their pain though
they were undoubtedly experi-
encing it. Smaller than a demi-
loaf of bread, with their entire
futures ahead of them, these
babies needed hope and that was
all I could give them.
I was not a doctor, a nurse or a
technician. I was just an observ-
er, a job-shadower. Though, after
15 minutes of walking and talking
to all the babies, who likely could
not see or hear me, all I wanted

Experiencing a day in the Neo-

difficult endeavor. It is easy to get
lost in life and forget about every-
one else. But spending time with
the premature babies in Tufts, to
whom I could honestly only give
my love to since I was qualified to
do nothing more, was a humbling
experience. I realized the impor-
tance of love in not only relation-

any venture one tackles.
I have been fortunate in life
to be surrounded by support and
love for every choice and accom-

haps that is why I want to give it
to others.
It is my turn to help and offer
the love others gave to me to
those who need it - to get excited
when three pounds of life smiles

to know that I am making the
uncertain lives of preemies more
certain and providing them the

random student interview by laura rgintar

Welcome to the Random
student Interview where
we find our new best
friends. Hey there, you look like
you just went through a serious
monsoon. Doesn't it suck to be
cold and wet?
Depends who you ask. I'd rather be
walking in the rain than walking in
the snow.
How was your Thanksgiving
break?
outstanding. I cooked for my entire
family and then ate myself into a
food coma. Then I woke up and
raged at the tailgate and then went
to Bassnectar.
Wow. Sounds like you really had
an indulgent weekend. Bassnec-
tar probably didn't help that
hangover.
Didn't make it worse. I think every
hangover needs another party to
cure it.
So you were the one cooking?
What did you make? Anything
special?
You can doctor up any responses ... I
have no dignity, so it's all up to you.
That's a really nice offer, but
unfortunately we like to stick to

the truth at the Daily so I'll leave
that up to my editor. Anyway,
so what'd you make? Any secret
recipes?
I made a lemon and rosemary dry-
brined turkey from a grass-fed tur-
key that I got in Chelsea, Michigan
and then hells side dishes like apple
and rosemary stuffing ... farro with
mushrooms, white bean mashed
potatoes, quinoa-stuffed squash
and the best banana cake with
chocolate frosting you'll seriously
ever eat. My great grandma would
roll over in her grave if I told you it
though. I don't mess with ghosts so
I'll keep my mouth shut.
That sounds like a professional
menu. I'm impressed. And I wish
you had some leftovers right
about now.
You should come over for leftovers.
Last night I got really high and
made biscuits and gravy to go with
them.
Long Pause.
What up, I did!
Well nothing better than a blaze
session and great grub after.
Hope they keep this, maybe read-
ers will assume you're talking

about medical marijuana ... Did
you storm the field Saturday?
I mean, does the Pope wear a hat?
I don't know, I'm Jewish. Does
he?
Haha. Touche! All right then, does a
bear shit in the woods?
Not if you shoot it first.
Oh! She's on fire! As an environ-
mentalist, I'm practically required
to say we can't be friends after that
comment.
Sorry, all in good fun. I like to
recycle my water bottles if that
helps. So I'm taking it you did
rush the field. Let me ask you this
- how did you get out of the sta-
dium?
We waited until the last minute
when they kicked us off. You basi-
cally had to pry me from the turf.
Last game as a senior, real hard to
leave the big house. But on the way
out, I actually- spotted Lloyd Carr
taking a picture with someone, and
we bombarded him for a senior pic-
ture.
Shut up. That's really cool.
It was so legendary. I thinktI deserve
a Michigan Legends card - for free!
Some shameless promotion I see.

Did you register for classes yet?
I backpacked them. Still waiting to
register. Tomorrow, 10:30 am.
Rough for a senior.
Tell me about it. I'm trying to fight
Mary Sue.
That probably won't go over well.
You should beat her to The Cube
one morning. Anything special
you're planning on taking? Any-
thing easy you want to share for
the rest of us?
Built Environment, which is all
about how humans reshape the
environments that they put them-
selves into.
Truth. That last one sounds
pretty philosophical and kind
of cool. Also, stats blows.
The messed up thing about stats is
that I took AP stats in high school
and got a 5 on the AP, and I'm still
not exempt from the class. Some
bogus stuff if you ask me.
Agreed ... there's all those fun
things to put in your graphing
calculator, though.
Hopefully my calculator still has
all those programs that Ican cheat
with.

Chock Ream was not happy when the Michi-
gan State Police's Livingston and Washt-
enaw Narcotics Enforcement Team raided
his Arborside medical marijuana dispen-
sary on Aug. 25.
"They've come into our dispensary ... and taken - sto-
len - all of our medicine, all of our records," said Ream,
president of the dispensary, located on 1818 Packard
Street, at the time.
The raid came one day after a state appellate court in
Isabella County ruled that dispensaries are not autho-
rized to sell marijuana under the Michigan Medical
Marihuana Act, which voters passed in 2008. Lt. Jerry
Cooley, a spokesman for LAWNET, denied that the raids
were connected to the appellate court's ruling, saying
that the raids were related to "previous investigations"
of dispensaries in Ann Arbor.
Some dispensaries in the city shut down for a brief
period after the court's ruling. Since the raid on Arbor-
side, new owners have taken over the dispensary, which
was previously called MedMar.
"The last owner was wiped out by a theft. A raid by
masked gunmen wiped him out," Ream said. "He is a
family man, with a wife and kids, and he has been really
hurt by these outrageous attacks."
State Attorney General Bill Schuette supported the
Isabella County prosecutors, and he released a statement
following the ruling that said his office would assist
other municipalities in shutting down dispensaries in
their area.
Ream criticized Schuette for his actions regarding
the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act, calling his role in
enforcing and implementing the act an "atrocity."
"His goal is to defeat the voters," Ream said. "He has
no respect for the voters, no respect for medical canna-
bis, and even though the voters voted 63 percent for it, it
makes no difference to him."
Several interview requests for this article were not
returned by Schuette's office.
Ream said that Schuette wants the state's medical
marijuana act to be "invalidated as unconstitutional."
"If you don't have dispensaries, you can't have the
range of products to take care of the needs of (medi-
cal marijuana) patients that are out there," Ream said.
"Schuette is supposed to enforce and implement the law,
and in this case, he is trying to destroy (it)."
Ann Arbor City Council member Sabra Briere (D-
Ward 1) recently attended a seminar led by Schuette
that was intended to educate law enforcement agencies
and local government officials on how to implement and
enforce the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act. However,
she said the seminar didn't serve its purpose.
"The presentation I went to didn't deal with imple-
mentation at all," Briere said. "(It) didn't provide infor-
mation to me that would help with understanding the
impact of the medical marijuana act on local govern-
ments."
She said the session focused on how to deal with citi-
zens who were not abiding by the terms of the medical
marijuana act.
When asked whether she thought Schuette had the
best interests of Michigan citizens in mind, Briere said
that was a question for the attorney general himself.
"I think he thinks he does," Briere said. "People can
only act on what they believe to be right."
Briere noted that Schuette is advising municipal pros-

ecutors and law enforcement agencies with a legal opin-
ion that may be inconclusive.
"At this point, prosecutors and the attorney general
are all interpreting the court's decisions in the most
broad, rather than most narrow, way possible," Briere
said.
She said she thinks it's an issue that officials interpret
the court ruling to deem the sale of medical marijuana
illegal. According to section 4 (e) of the Michigan Medi-
cal Marihuana Act, registered caregivers "may receive
compensation for costs associated with assisting a reg-
istered qualifying patient in the medical use of mari-
juana."
This section of the law gave prospective dispensary
owners enough leeway to open their businesses after the
"He has no respect
for the voters,
no respect for
medical cannabis,
and even though
the voters voted
63 percent for
it, it makes no
difference. "
-Chuck Ream, president of
Arborside dispensary
act was passed. However, the act goes on to say that a
transaction does not constitute the sale of the substance.
The apparent conflict was the center of the Isa-
bella County ruling, which ultimately upheld
the latter section of the law.
Briere agreed with Ream that Schuette's
interpretation of the ruling is at conflict
with the results of the November 2008 bal
lot initiative that passed referendum that
passed to become state law.
"I feel that it is in some people's best
interest to interpret everything very,
narrowly, and that best interest is not ..4
necessarily the best interest of the
large majority of Michigan residents
who said 'allow medical marijuana,' "
Briere said. /g
Stephen Postema, the city attor-
ney for Ann Arbor, has offered to
assist in pushing for a local control
law at the state level.
At an Oct. 26 meeting of Ann
Arbor's Medical Marijuana Licensing
Board, Postema said the ambiguities in state law make
it difficult for the city to issue licensing ordinances with

legal authority.
"The city is in a difficult position, because when you
think about it, the act of licensing and using the gov-
ernment to license something raises some problematic
issues for us," he said. "I know it is a disappointment,
and I am not here to apologize for the law.
"The law is imperfect, and the law can be changed
and I would encourage the law to be changed."
In June, the Ann Arbor City Council passed two ordi-
nances focusing on medical marijuana zoning and cul-
tivation regulations to be implemented citywide. The
passage came after the two ordinances were repeatedly
postponed over a period of seven months.
F
Ann Arbor resident Ben Ogren, a medical marijuana
cardholder, said he grows his own marijuana and finds
dispensaries "expensive."
Ogren uses medical marijuana to alleviate symptoms
he experiences from sinus infections. Ogren said dispen- K
saries have an important role in aiding patients who may
need guidance in deciding what products are appropri-
ate for their specific condition.
He said they also are an attractive model for munici-
palities because they have been suggested to alleviate
crime by removing some drug dealers from city streets.
Dispensaries offer a safe, clean, secluded area where
patients who don't grow their own cannabis can get the
help they need and be assured they are buying products
that are safe and of appropriate potency, he explained.
"Plain and simple, they're bringing money into their
town," Ogren said. "People are driving from all over the
state to come to dispensaries that are here."
Ogren said marijuana users have always used the
drug to deal with problems such as anxiety or stress,
even though the idea of legalizing medical marijuana is
relatively new.
"The doctors are just kind of ushering it in as, like,
being socially acceptable, I guess," Ogren said.
Though members of Ann Arbor's Medical Marijuana
Licensing Board will continue to meet, the future of the
city's dispensaries is unclear. Ream said state lawmakers
are working to draft a local control law that will help cit-
ies implement the state law, but no legislation has been
voted on as of yet. Further action by the attorney general
could complicate the already convoluted legal conflict.

Wednesday, November 30,2011 //The Statement
F

For most college students, opportunities
to meet potential significant others are
presented on Friday nights at the bars,
in the classroom or through the suggestion
of a mutual friend.
But for students like Engineering senior
Rick, who wishes to remain anonymous, it
takes just a few clicks of his mouse from the
comfort of his room to access thousands of
profiles on Datemyschool.com, an online dat-
ing website for college students launched by
two Columbia University students last year.
Living in a generation defined by depen-
dence on the Internet and an obsession with
Facebook and Twitter, it seems natural that
more and more people log on to Match.com,
OkCupid.com and eHarmony.com to search
for their soul mates.
Online dating, despite its unconventional
methods, can be appealing for busy students
like LSA senior Lauren Andrzejewski, the
pressures of classes and extracurricular
activities leavelittle time for a romantic life.
"I don't even have time to go out, and
when I do go out, I'm usually just with my
friends and not really interested in meeting
anyone new," Andrzejewski said.
She noted the college scene isn't exactly
conducive to finding a significant other.
"Everyone is just so busy and has their
own interests and so concerned about their
future," Andrzejewski said. "I think that a
lot of people just aren't even looking for rela-
tionships."
Rick found out about Date My School
when he happened to pick up a flyer in the
basement of the Shapiro Undergraduate
Library. He is one of the 800 University stu-
dents with profiles on the website. After his
roommate created a profile for Rick as a joke,
he has been an active user for about a month
and enjoys going on the site despite the stig-
ma associated with Internet dating.
Rick added that Date My School differs
from other sites like Match.com and eHar-
mony, which are geared more toward adults.
"I guess there's kind of this camaraderie,"
Rick said. "Everybody on the site knows that
there's this stigma with online dating. Yeah,
there are girls on there that are trying to find
their future husband, but at the same time,
there's an understanding of what's really
going on."
Though he hasn't gone on any dates
through the site, Rick has talked to plenty
of girls with the help of Date My School.
Having a profile, he said, helps to facilitate
conversation and is a handy tool that isn't
available when meeting someone in real life.
"It's definitely different," he said. "It's
difficult to pick up what you want to say
to a person, but it's easier at the same time
because you can view their profile and see
what they like."
Humberto, a senior at the University who
wishes to remain anonymous, has had a pro-
file on Date My School for more than a year
and also frequents OkCupid, a dating web-
site that suggests matches for the members
based on their answers to quizzes.
For Humberto, online dating allows him
to engage in the dating scene while juggling

his busyaschedule. He said he feels this meth-
od is more efficient since everyone on the site
is presumably looking for the same thing - a
relationship.
"If you're looking for somebody to date
and you go to a bar, you don't know if the
other person is there for that (or) if they're
there just to have fun, and you might offend
somebody if you ask," Humberto said. "At
least in this environment, everyone's there
because they want a relationship or some
sort of thing."
With online dating, there's an inevitable
fear that the person on the other side of the
computer screen might not be the same per-
son described in his or her profile. In addi-
tion, online daters are often classified as
people who have failed romantically in the
real world.
For this reason, Humberto and Rick
preferred not to reveal their real names.
Humberto requested that his school be
unidentified.
For Rick, watching his grandfather bring
home questionable women with the help of
Match.com made him apprehensive about
joiningthe online dating community.
-"He has tons of fun. He brings home girls
all the time at any time of the year. By and
large, they're nice enough, but they're all
weird in some shape or form," Rick said. "So
it's kind of shaped my experience, kind of not
to expect so much."
To some extent, the fears many people
have are valid.
Nicole Ellison, an associate professor in
the department of telecommunication, infor-
mation studies and media at Michigan State
University, studied the distinction between
online and offline personas by interviewing
participants and examining their profiles.
Ellison found that people generally don't
consider the online dating profile as a true
representation of their offline identity and
are more creative with their profiles.
"In some cases, the profile was actually
a manifestation of the kind of person they
wanted to be, or they expected to be in the
future or they had been in the past," Ellison
said.
Despite this, gross misrepresentations on
profiles - which fuel the fear that a 20-year-
old person will actually turn out to be a
50-year-old criminal - are not as common.
Though worries like this have become one of
the reasons why online dating has attracted
such a social stigma, findings from another
study conducted by Ellison revealed that
extreme exaggerations on profiles are rare.
In a study that compared the participants'
accurate height, weight and age to how they
described themselves in their profiles, Elli-
son found many online daters embellished
on one of the three characteristics. However,
the inconsistencies were so small that they
would not be noticeable in real life.
"On average, the discrepancies were quite

small and probably not that different from
the kind of impression management we do
offline," Ellison said. "So anytime you wake
up and put on a little makeup or wear high
heels - these are all ways we show our
offline impressions as well."
Ellison has found that society's disapprov-
al of online dating has diminished since she
first started studying the phenomenon.
"I think so many of us are so used to doing
everything online - buying plane tickets
and booking a flight, getting information,"
Ellison said. "It's a very natural extension of
that to look at the way in which the process
of dating people can be made more efficient
by doing it online."
Humberto also felt that online dating
has become less stigmatized simply due to
advancemes in technology and expansive
use of the Internet. He compared the use of
the Internet for meeting potential matches
as the same as the invention of the telephone,
which allowed people to communicate with-
out having to see each other face-to-face.
"While it's a great thing to actually go see
people, there's a lot of times where you'll
never meet somebody and you could on the
Internet," Humberto explained.
Despite the diminishing stigma, many
University students still aren't comfortable
with taking their romantic pursuits online.
According to LSA freshman Daniel
Schindler, a marketing intern for Date My
School, there are about 800 students from
the University who have profiles on the site
and about 42,000 students with profiles
across the country. Of the 50,000 students
who attend the University, 800 profiles is a
miniscule number. Both Rick and Humberto
observed that not many people on campus
use online dating websites.
"There are a lot of profiles on here, but
none of my friends are on it, and while I've
been perusing profiles, I haven't seen any
profiles of any person I've ever met in per-
son," Rick said.
Rick added that while he plans to keep
his profile active, he would never arrange to
meet up with someone he met on the Inter-
net.
"Especially in today's day and age, you can
never be too safe with who you meet on the
Internet," Rick said. "The kind of girls that
would go out with a guy that she just met
online - not knowing what he's all about and
without really digging in and doing some
deeper research - that would scare me if I
was a girl."
Columbia University Balazs Alexa co-
founded Date My School with classmate
Jean Meyer in November 2010 when a female

friend in the Nursing School at Columbia
complained that she didn't meet many men
in her primarily female field of education.
Alexa and Meyer observed that there
wasn't much interaction between the dif-
ferent schools on Columbia's campus and
wanted to find a way to encourage inter-
school dating.
Alexa said the website quickly took off
at Columbia and nearby universities and is
now accountable for more than 50 percent
of the dates at both Columbia and New York
University.
Alexa said he believes the website has
seen success in its first year because Date
My School offers more security options for
the user.
"If you go on (other) social networking
sites or dating sites, it's not safe at all ... Date
My School is unmatched in the privacy and
safety that we have. And that creates, basi-
cally, a space of vibrant community ... that
people are free to let loose and let their
safeguards down," he said.
Andrzejewski had a brief fling with
online dating during spring term, when she
and her roommate decided to make a profile
for fun on eHarmony after seeing a com-
mercial on TV. The website suggested some
compatible matches for her, and she con-
sidered meeting up with some of the guys
who seemed decent, including a promising
26-year-old match who worked for Google.
But she didn't pursue any of her matches.
"I was afraid that it would be awkward
and that just because I hadn't known the
person, I'd end up going there and they'd be
really weird and I'd have no way to get out
of it," Andrzejewski said.
Andrzejewski also had only a free
account on eHarmony and therefore
couldn't see any pictures of her matches,
which prevented her from going on actual
dates due to the fear that they could be lying
about their age.
Ellison reasoned that online dating hasn't
become as widespread on college campuses
because of the myriad of opportunities that
college life presents for students.
"My sense is that there may be more of
a stigma for college students, just because
college students have so many opportuni-
ties to interact with and meet new people
that they're not really going to benefit as
much because they have all these other ave-
nues," Ellison said.
Ellison added that the participants she
and her colleagues spoke with in her study
were people who did not have access to
the same social life that students do. For
instance, a woman who worked in the fash-
ion industry and consequently met only gay
men or a rural resident with few nightlife
opportunities might find online dating
more beneficial due to their lifestyles.
Andrzejewski no longer uses the dating
website and said she feels that real-life inter-
actions provide more indication of whether
or not there is an attraction between two
people.
"Usually, when you meet someone out at
