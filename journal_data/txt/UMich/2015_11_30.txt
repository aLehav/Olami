In opinion, state 
judge says colleges 
can set their own 
firearm regulations

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

A judge has dismissed a lawsuit 

that challenged the University’s 
campus ban on firearms.

In a state Court of Claims 

ruling handed down earlier this 
month, Judge Cynthia Stephens 
agreed with the University’s 
defense of the ban.

In particular, she drew a 

distinction between the University 
and local townships, writing that 
the University was not subject to 
state law that prohibits townships 
from 
setting 
gun 
laws, 
the 

Associated Press reported.

“The state Constitution grants 

the university the autonomy to 
promulgate 
its 
own 
firearms 

regulation,” Stephens wrote.

The lawsuit, initiated by Ann 

Arbor resident Joshua Wade, 
argued that the University did not 
have the authority to set stricter 
gun-control laws for campus than 
those set by the state.

Currently in Michigan, certain 

zones, including colleges, are 
labeled gun-free. In effect, this 
means that concealed carry of 
weapons is not allowed, but those 
with a concealed carry permit can 
carry guns openly.

The University’s policy takes 

this ban a step further, banning 
firearms of all kinds except for 
military 
or 
law 
enforcement 

personnel or educational purposes. 
The University Board of Regents 
also has the ability to grant a waiver 
in “extraordinary circumstances,” 
according to the Regents Bylaws 
Article X, Section 4. Wade filed the 
lawsuit after the University denied 
his request for a waiver.

Wade’s attorney, Steven Dulan, 

had argued in court filings that the 
power to establish policies about 
guns rested with the legislature, 
not with colleges, according to the 
Detroit Free Press.

Ezekiel Elliott 

dominates 

Michigan in the 

run game

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

In Jim Harbaugh’s first game 

coaching against Ohio State, it was 
Ezekiel Elliott who stole the show.

Elliott set the tone for the 

game, running for 214 yards and 
two touchdowns in a statement 
performance as the Buckeyes 
(7-1 Big Ten, 11-1 overall) beat No. 
10 Michigan, 42-13, at Michigan 
Stadium on Saturday.

J.T. Barrett added 113 yards 

passing and 139 yards on the 
ground, accumulating four total 
touchdowns, but the star of the 
day was Elliott.

After criticizing his coaches 

for giving him just 12 carries in a 

17-14 loss to the Michigan State 
last week, Elliott shouldered the 
workload early and often against 
the Wolverines (6-2, 9-3). He had 
75 yards by the end of the first 
quarter, 66 of which came on one 
long rush to set up Ohio State’s 
first touchdown. He only got 
stronger from there.

The Wolverines were still 

within striking range of the 
Buckeyes at halftime, trailing just 
14-10, but Elliott and Barrett made 
quick work of them in the second 

half. The win marked Ohio State’s 
fourth 
consecutive 
win 
over 

Michigan, and the 11th time in the 
last 12 meetings that the Buckeyes 
have come out on top.

Barrett threw his only passing 

touchdown of the day to Jalin 
Marshall on the first possession 
of the third quarter, and after 
Michigan’s next drive, Ohio State 
wore down the Wolverines.

Barrett and Elliott led a 16-play, 

84-yard drive that took 7:05 off 

Buckeyes spoil Harbaugh’s 
first game in heated rivalry

The Michigan defense couldn’t contain Ohio State, as quarterback J.T. Barrett rushed for three touchdowns in the Buckeyes’ 42-13 win on Saturday.

Schlissel, Pollack 
say online group 

was not recognized 
by the University

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

After demonstrations sprung 

up earlier this month calling for 
improved diversity and inclusion 
at college campuses across the 
country, several White Student 
Union Facebook pages appeared 
on Facebook this week, including 
one claiming to be affiliated with 
the University. 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel and University Provost 
Martha Pollack contacted Facebook 
on 
Wednesday 
morning 
and 

requested the group be shut down, 
citing unauthorized use of the 
University’s trademarked seal. The 
page has since been taken down.

As of 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, the 

page remained visible on Facebook 
and had 38 members. The page 
listed the LSA building as its 
address. The founding members 

are not shown on the Facebook 
group, and it is unclear whether 
actual University students have 
any role in the creation of this page.

“We’re a new organization for 

students of European descent 
and our allies on the University 
of Michigan campus, inspired by 
the spread of other White Student 
Unions nation wide,” the group 
states in its page description. “We 
provide a safe space for white 
students to air their feelings about 
our nation’s future, discuss and 
reflect on our glorious past, and 
begin programs to reclaim that lost 
glory. We affirm the dignity and 
ancestry of our proud people who 
given the world so much in terms 
of civilization and beauty and are 
committed to securing a future for 
our posterity and spirit.”

In a press release, Schlissel and 

Pollack said the White Student 
Union is not a recognized student 
organization on campus.

The New York Times reported 

Tuesday that over 30 White 
Student Union Facebook groups 
have 
been 
created 
claiming 

affiliation with universities. Some 
of these groups have already been

30 teams from 

colleges across the 
country compete in 

Columbus

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

A few days before Michigan 

played Ohio State in Ann Arbor on 
Saturday, another University team 
won big in Columbus, Ohio.

The 
University’s 
Ballroom 

Dance Team won the national 
championship title for the 12th 
consecutive year, beating out about 
30 other teams from universities 
across the country.

LSA freshman Anna Haynes said 

the competition consists of several 
rounds. Each time a dancing couple 
is called back to dance again, their 
team receives a point.

“Each couple gets to choose eight 

dances,” she said. “There are a lot of 
dances, but you’re only allowed to 
choose your favorite eight. For me, 
I’m a dancing newcomer so we start 
out with our most basic in the first 
round. If you get callbacks you keep

“The Michigan Constitution 

vests the power to legislate with 
the state legislature, not with 
the state universities,” Dulan 
wrote. “It is clear that the Board 
of Regents is powerful within 
the governance of the University 
itself, but it has no authority to 
attempt to usurp the legislature’s 
constitutionally-delegated 
role 

in the state government.”

Dulan told media outlets he 

intended to appeal the decision.

A similar court case, filed by 

Michigan Gun Owners against 
the Ann Arbor Public Schools, 
was thrown out in September. 
However, in response to a third 
lawsuit about the ability of 
individual units of governance 
to step beyond state gun law, 
a Genesee County judge ruled 
differently, finding that school 
districts couldn’t ban individuals 
from carrying in schools. 

Both in court and in the 

legislature, the University has 

defended its policies about gun-
free zones.

In an October interview with 

The Michigan Daily, Cynthia 
Wilbanks, 
vice 
president 
of 

government relations, said the 
University intended to stand 
firm in its decision to ban guns 
on campus, noting legislative 
attempts to modify the definition 
of gun-free zones.

Wilbanks said the current 

policy on campus banning guns 
is an important one, particularly 
in light of a bill currently in 
the state legislature seeking to 
change the way the gun-free 
zones work in the state.

“It’s true that years ago when 

the gun statutes were modified, 
we did work hard to get gun-
free zones,” Wilbanks said. “The 
regents have an ordinance that 
is very clear: On the University 
of Michigan campus, there shall 
be no guns … Right now we will 
rely on our regents’ ordinance to 
be enforced.”

Other 
universities 
in 
the 

state have taken similar stances, 

with 
several 
universities 
in 

Michigan, such as Lake Superior 
State University, banning guns 
on campus. Others are more 
permissive, allowing them in 
certain campus areas.

Wilbanks 
noted 
that 
she 

believed this is the best way to 
handle the situation — allowing 
each institution to set its own 
policies.

“All 
universities 
have 
a 

stake in this,” Wilbanks said. 
“Having said that, there are 
universities who have a slightly 
different approach to guns on 
campus. Some permit concealed 
weapons in the trunks of cars. 
Others permit students who 
are interested in hunting or 
shooting at the range to register 
their guns and they are provided 
a safe lockup for their guns 
while they’re on campus so that 
there’s a safe place for them to 
go. Every campus may have a 
slightly different approach. Ours 
is pretty clear. Others are clear 
in a slightly different way, but 
that actually supports our view 

that every campus ought to think 
about the ways in which the laws 
work best for them.”

However, open-carry activists 

have expressed disagreement 
with that position. In an August 
interview with the Daily, Phillip 
Hofmeister, a legislative assistant 
for Michigan Open Carry Inc., 
an 
organization 
promoting 

lawful open carry of a holstered 
handgun, said he supported 
Wade’s position because he felt 
gun-free zones ultimately lead to 
a more dangerous environment.

“We feel that places where 

guns are banned (by state statute 
or 
private 
property 
policy) 

create a criminal empowerment 
zone,” Hofmeister wrote in an 
e-mail. “These are places where 
criminals carry guns and can use 
them to harm others (as by their 
nature, criminals don’t care 
about the law or private property 
rights), but law abiding citizens 
are not given the opportunity 
to protect themselves with their 
own arms.”

going up until finals, which is a 
huge deal because sometimes there 
will be 90 couples starting out and 
you make it to the top eight.”

Business senior Jiaxin Zheng, 

the 
Ballroom 
Dance 
Team 

president, said newcomers like 
Haynes, coupled with a robust 
recruitment process, contribute 
heavily to the success of the team.

“We have a great recruitment 

system,” she said. “At the beginning 
of the year we go out and get 
people to try ballroom dancing and 
emphasize that anyone can do it. 
I think we’re able to win because 
of the numbers and also because 
we’re able to emphasize that being 
on this team is not just learning 
how to dance, it’s ultimately going 
to the competitions.”

Team 
members 
are 

professionally 
coached 
by 

Olympic-level 
ice-dancing 

coaches and national champion 
ballroom 
dancers 
Susan 
and 

Steve McFerran. Zheng said the 
McFerrans’ training gives the team 
an edge during competition.

“Our coaches have been a key 

drive for our success because 

without them we wouldn’t have 
had a structured team where 
people tryout and make a team to 
learn from them,” she said. “A lot 
of collegiate ballroom clubs are just 
student organized, so they have 
a really hard time maintaining 
continuity from season to season. 
Because we have our coaches 
and a structured team setting, 
we’ve been able to maintain a 
longstanding presence on campus.”

Engineering 
senior 
Andrew 

Simon said upperclassmen dancers 
assist 
in 
teaching 
newcomers 

and, alongside the coaches, are 
responsible for 150 to 200 dancers of 
varying ability in a given semester.

Simon added that because the 

team is broken down into different 
ability levels, the amount of 
instruction each member receives 
can differ based on their section. 
Upper-level dancers are broken 
into Simon said the hard work of 
each section contributed to their 
success in Columbus.

“The quality of the dancing 

will allow more callbacks and 
that will build up points for our 
team,” he said. “Every single 
person matters, and that’s why at 
the very beginning of recruitment 
we work really hard to get as 
many people to join the team as 

possible and get them into it and 
build up a passion for it because it 
helps us a lot when it comes time 
for nationals.”

Simon 
said 
the 
team’s 

continuous success at nationals 
is a reflection of the different 
aspects of the team that allow 
for consistent training and strong 
team membership.

“If you’ve seen other dance 

groups on campus they’re always 
in Angell Hall or trying to find 
random places. I think we’re one 
of the only teams that has a dance 
studio which allows for consistent 
training. On top of that, we’re 
very well funded from CSG. This 
makes the team affordable for a 
lot of people.”

Haynes 
said 
the 
team’s 

enthusiasm 
toward 
fostering 

learning and new membership 
allowed her as a freshman to feel 
like she contributed greatly to the 
win in Columbus.

“It was so exciting,” she said. 

“It was great because they say 
that the reason we win nationals 
so much is that we bring so many 
new students and let so many 
people try it out every year. So it’s 
really exciting to know that you 
were a part of getting a point for 
your team.”

issues and fostering education in 
science and technology.

In 
an 
interview 
Saturday, 

Green, who works on research 
projects focusing on polymers — 
large 
molecules 
characterized 

by their chain-like structure — 
said an election to the society 
aims to recognize an individual’s 
contributions to science.

Green said applications of his 

own work include organic solar 
cells, membranes and sensors.

“If you look around you, you 

see a lot of application involving 
polymers,” he said. “The big 
technological drive nowadays is 
you want to make things smaller 
and smarter. What it means then, 
is that you’re now processing and 
producing materials at very, very 
small dimensions.”

Dalton wrote in an e-mail 

interview that he has been a 
general member of the AAAS 
for more than 25 years and was 
honored to be elected as a fellow.

“Fellows are elected based on 

their scientific accomplishments 
to advance the science in their 
field,” Dalton said. “It’s rewarding 

for my work and efforts to be 
recognized by my peers.”

Dalton said he has published 

about 160 peer-reviewed scientific 
papers in the areas of drug 
discovery 
and 
development, 

pharmacology, 
endocrinology 

and cancer, and is also listed as a 
co-inventor on more than 200 U.S. 
and international patents.

McKay, another elected fellow, 

wrote in an e-mail interview 
that he hoped to increase his 
involvement in the society going 
forward.

“I have always looked to 

the AAAS for leadership in 
science education, policy, and 
exchange, and look forward to 
taking my involvement with the 
AAAS to a higher level as a new 
fellow,” he wrote.

At the University, McKay is 

a data scientist with experience 
drawing inferences from large 
data sets in astrophysics. He also 
works 
on 
education 
research 

to 
understand 
and 
improve 

classroom outcomes for students 
in higher education.

Carethers 
oversees 
the 

Department 
of 
Internal 

Medicine, the largest department 
at the University. Within the 
department, 
he 
operates 
a 

National Institutes of Health 
research laboratory in the Medical 
School where faculty and students 
perform experiments to benefit 
colorectal cancer patients.

“I think I was a good nominee 

for the honor because of the success 
of my research and research 
funding along with its national and 
international recognition among 
peers,” Carethers wrote. “This 
is through my publications, as 
well as national and international 
presentations regarding the field 
of my research, and my reputation 
for high quality data. I also think 
my role in managing a very large 
department of 760 faculty paid an 
additional role while maintaining 
a research program.”

Overall, McKay said academic 

honors like the fellowship are a 
way to support scholarly work.

“Faculty members often give 

their ideas away, sharing openly 
what they learn to advance human 
knowledge,” McKay wrote. “The 
main rewards for this work are 
impact — we might hope to change 
the world — and reputation — 
we all hope to be recognized for 
what we do. Being selected for 
fellowship in the AAAS is exactly 
the kind of reputational reward 
that keeps scholars working away.”

FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THIS WEEK (NOV. 30, 2000)

‘U’ enrolls more diverse class

SLOW M AGIC

The University reported 

enrolling a more diverse 
freshman class than in previ-
ous years.

Of the freshman class who 

started college in 2000, 14.5 
percent of students identi-
fied as an underrepresented 
minority, compared to 11.4 
percent of students the year 
before.

Even with a more diverse 

freshman class, the Univer-
sity’s overall percentage of 
underrepresented minorities 
decreased. University offi-
cials said the overall decrease 
in minority students was an 
issue that needed to be fixed, 
but reported that they did 
not have any target goals or 

quotas related to race for stu-
dent enrollment.

There were also more stu-

dents than ever who opted to 
not report their race on their 
applications, with 402 out of 
5,418 students declining to 
indicate their race.

At the time, the University 

was also considering wheth-
er to work toward increasing 
University enrollment over-
all.

In 2015, the University 

enrolled the highest propor-
tion 
of 
underrepresented 

minority 
freshmen 
since 

2005, with 12.8 percent of 
the enter class identified as 
underrepresented minority 
students.

Thirty-five years ago 

this week (Dec. 2, 1980)

The LSA student govern-

ment installed students Sue 
Porter and Margaret Talm-
ers as the new president 
and vice president, respec-
tively. With 16 percent of 
LSA students voting, it was 
the highest turnout ever for 
student government elec-
tions, and nearly four times 
the amount of votes cast in 
the previous year.

Both Porter and Talmers 

were members of a student 
political party called Stu-
dent Alliance for Institu-
tional Development.

“We 

want to take this moment to 
reaffirm our deep and abiding 
commitment to this goal, and 
to working diligently, with the 
entire university community, 
to achieve it.”

University 
spokesperson 

Rick Fitzgerald could not 
be reached for comment 
Wednesday afternoon.

Earlier this month, the 

University held a week-long 
summit to gather community 
input 
as 
the 
institution 

forms a strategic plan for 
improving campus climate 
and increasing diversity of 
the student body and faculty. 
Schlissel said the summit 
reflected his commitment at 
large to diversity on campus, 

not solely in response to recent 
incidents at the University of 
Missouri and Yale University.

“We didn’t launch the 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
strategic planning process 
in the setting of a crisis,” he 
said in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily earlier 
this month. “We launched it 
in the setting of an ongoing 
commitment to the public 
and the students that we 
serve and to build an inclusive 
community.”

I choose to believe I am loved
I

think it’s safe to say that at one 
point or another, we have all 
struggled to ignore the “haters” 

— those faceless, 
largely imagined 
enemies who are 
determined 
to 

bring us down. 
Aside from the 
truly 
famous, 

most of us only 
have one or two 
regular 
critics, 

but 
sometimes 

we 
exaggerate 

their 
negative 

comments in our 
minds until it feels like the whole 
world is against us.

According to a 2012 column in the 

New York Times, focusing on the 
negative is common because negative 
emotions require more processing 
than positive ones, causing us to 
ruminate about them more frequently. 
I have often found myself ruminating 
about comments people have made 
about me, letting the words circle 
endlessly in my mind until I can no 
longer think straight. Ceasing to 
concern myself with how others see 
me has been difficult, but definitely 
worth the effort.

I spent most of the first two decades 

of my life letting my perception of how 
others perceived me drag me down. 
I already had low self-esteem, and I 
used every negative comment as proof 
that I was, in fact, unloved. By the time 
I entered college, my confirmation 
bias had reached such an extreme that 
I no longer needed to hear negative 
comments to feel that others disliked 
me — I simply assumed they did.

Believing I was unloved became 

exhausting, but it seemed like a safer 
bet than the alternative. What if I 
were to convince myself that everyone 
cared about me, only to find out one 
day that they didn’t? Such a realization 
would be heartbreaking. I might as 
well come to terms with “reality” 
before I got hurt.

I began to question my need for 

a realistic self-image after taking a 
social psychology class my sophomore 
year. We learned about the theory of 
depressive realism, which states that 
people with depression have a far more 
realistic perception of their skills and 
abilities compared to non-depressed 
people. I realized that maintaining a 
realistic perception of my relationships 
was pointless if it led to unhappiness. 
Either I could continue to be sad and 
focus on all the signs indicating that 
people didn’t enjoy my company, or 
I could put on the same rose-colored 
glasses as everyone else and tell myself 
that I was loved. 

Adjusting my attitude proved 

difficult because I had spent so many 
years thinking negatively. It wasn’t 
until I fell into an actual depression 
last winter that I knew I needed to 
change. A lot of things in my life 
spiraled out of control that semester, 
but I realized the one factor I could 
control was how I responded. Since 
I yearned for authentic connections 
with other people, I decided to stop 
worrying about what others thought 
of me and spend time with people 
whose company I enjoyed. Instead 
of facing disdain from others, I 
experienced an outpouring of love. 
This semester alone, I have formed 
more genuine friendships than I did 

in all three previous years of college 
combined.

Though I’m still aware that I 

could get hurt if these connections 
dissolve, I no longer actively think 
about this possibility. For one thing, 
now that I’m less paranoid about 
people leaving me, I’m less inclined 
to accidentally push them away. For 
another, if people are hell-bent on 
walking out of my life, they’ll do it 
regardless of whether I see it coming. 
I might as well enjoy the connections 
while they last and move on when 
the time comes. After all, if one 
friendship expires, there are 7 billion 
more people in the world with whom 
I can connect.

Now that I have a healthier 

perception of how others see me, 
the faceless “haters” have all but 
disappeared in my mind. David Foster 
Wallace once said, “You will become 
way less concerned with what other 
people think of you when you realize 
how seldom they do.” I’ve noticed 
recently that people are so caught up 
in their own problems that they hardly 
have time to scrutinize me.

The truth is that everyone from 

my past who I assumed disliked me 
probably felt indifferent toward me. 
Now that the imaginary haters have 
vanished, I have space in my heart to 
let in the love from those who truly 
care. Yes, I’ll always have one or two 
critics who will hold grudges against 
me no matter what. But I have control 
over how I perceive everyone else’s 
perceptions of me. I choose to believe 
that I am loved.

CSG continues silencing 

minority voices

SINDHU SREEDHAR | MICHIGAN IN COLOR

This past Sunday, I, along with 

the other 10 members of the Cam-
pus Inclusion Commission under 
the Central Student Government, 
resigned. The original goal of the 
commission was to provide a space 
within the student government 
where students with marginalized 
identities would feel safe voicing 
their concerns. However we, as a 
commission, came to the conclusion 
that CSG’s efforts to make campus 
more inclusive weren’t entirely gen-
uine and we felt that working with 
them wasn’t in our best interests. 
We left, not because the chair of our 
commission was fired, but because 
of what we believe are the reasons 
why he was fired — for making 
noise, for demanding justice after 
I personally faced discrimination 
within CSG, for questioning CSG’s 
homogeneity and for advocating for 
minority voices. In other words, for 
doing his job.

As a woman of color, I often feel 

as though I have limited influence 
in spaces. Because of that, I often 
let problematic things go unchecked 
and don’t say anything for fear of 
retaliation. The firing of the CIC 
chair will not be one of them. Here’s 
my story.

This past September, an execu-

tive committee member of CSG met 
with me to inform me of a significant 
change within student government 
structure — three separate com-
missions would be merged into one 
larger Campus Inclusion Commis-
sion. As the executive chair of the 
LGBTQ Issues Commission, that 
decision would significantly impact 
my role. However, before I could say 
anything, he said that if the com-
mission didn’t comply with the new 
structure, we could leave CSG, and 
they would find people to replace us. 
The preemptive threat caught me 
off guard and I felt pressured to go 
along with what he was saying, sim-
ply because of the power dynamic. 
He is a white man in a higher posi-
tion than me, and had just implied 
that that I was dispensable. I’m a 
woman of color with seemingly no 
real authority in that space. Whose 
voice really matters here? I felt as 
though the LGBTQ community that 
I was advocating for had suddenly 
lost any voice that it may have ever 
had in CSG.

That meeting set the tone for 

the rest of my involvement in CSG. 
However, despite that encounter, I 
still tried to be open to the idea of 
working with the student govern-

ment because of the credibility they 
have under the administration and 
the reach they have with students. 
I continued to brush that event and 
my skepticism aside in order to do 
what I came to do — create a more 
inclusive campus.

Things moved quickly from there, 

as they do in CSG. A chair was 
appointed to be the head of what 
we now called the Campus Inclu-
sion Commission, or CIC. The new 
commission first met in mid-Octo-
ber, and by the middle of November 
we had three large projects in pro-
cess and the members of our new 
team began to get closer. Feeling 
decently comfortable with them, I 
offhandedly mentioned the unset-
tling interaction I’d had with the 
CSG executive committee member. 
Our chair immediately suggested 
that we report the microaggression 
to the rest of the executive commit-
tee, and after a day of thinking over 
it, I decided it should be addressed. 
Though I didn’t want to cause trou-
ble or ill-will within CSG, I believed 
that discussing the comment and 
its impact could begin to create a 
more inclusive campus, one person 
at a time. Especially given that doing 
so aligned with the mission of the 
inclusion committee that student 
government had just created, I’d 
believed we would have their sup-
port. I was very wrong.

After the CIC chair and I reported 

the incident to the rest of the execu-
tive committee, we attempted sever-
al methods of restorative justice. We 
tried implementing an ally training 
for all members of the assembly. We 
tried getting the executive commit-
tee member who’d made the com-
ment to go to an ally training. We 
tried creating a new position on the 
executive committee to hold them 
all accountable to using inclusive 
language and taking the needs of 
marginalized students into consid-
eration. Many of these initiatives 
either never happened, or were dis-
missed as “miscommunications,” an 
issue that has arisen in the majority 
of my dealings with CSG.

Finally, I met with the CSG advis-

er and president last week to talk 
about the original microaggression 
that I had faced, now, two months 
ago. I explained it yet again, think-
ing that this would be my final deal-
ing with this issue. Instead of simply 
listening to what had happened 
and helping me find the solution 
I’d wanted, they began probing me 
about the commission chair — the 

person who’d helped me report in 
the first place. They asked me how 
I felt that our commission chair had 
taken charge in dealing with the 
issue and making sure I was treated 
fairly. Though I didn’t fully under-
stand why I was being asked about 
our commission chair, I was honest 
with them in saying that he only 
took charge in dealing with the issue 
when I had asked him to. At the time, 
I’d believed they were just trying to 
support me, but I now see that they 
had been trying to ambush me into 
providing the executive committee 
with an excuse to fire him.

I realized this last Friday, when I 

saw an e-mail in my inbox from the 
executive committee. It said, very 
bluntly and without explanation, 
that our commission chair had been 
fired. In their words, the position 
“was vacated.”

The reasons the commission chair 

was fired were laid out in a letter 
that he shared with me. For exam-
ple, one of the fireable offenses CSG 
states was the miscommunication 
concerning who would be facilitat-
ing a training given to the assem-
bly. However, given the amount of 
miscommunication I’d experienced 
throughout my time on CSG and the 
fact that no one else had been vis-
ibly disciplined for it, this is at best 
selective enforcement. Only our 
commission chair was faulted for 
it. Another one of the reasons the 
commission chair was fired was for 
an interaction that very closely mir-
rored the incident in which I faced a 
microaggression by a member of the 
executive committee. The executive 
committee member was made aware 
of his actions and received ally 
training afterward, but he was not at 
all punished for the issue that hap-
pened months before. He was also 
on the panel that voted to fire our 
commission chair. While I am not 
defending this particular action, the 
fact remains that the CIC chair was 
fired for an issue that didn’t warrant 
punishment in the past.

Though I will always be invested 

in advocating for a more inclusive 
campus, I (and the rest of the former 
CIC members) have realized that 
student government is not the place 
to do it. From the unchecked com-
ments to the subtle power plays to 
the unjust firing of our commission 
chair, CSG is no longer an organiza-
tion I trust or am willing to work for.

Wanting to be 
Brian Wilson

I

used to think the Beach 
Boys’s story ended after 
1967, when Brian Wilson 

suffered a mental breakdown 
while trying to complete a 
follow-up to Pet Sounds. I 
thought the 
’70s were a 
black hole 
for the band, 
a period of 
time when 
none of its 
members 
did much 
of anything 
until they 
somehow 
reemerged 
on the oldies 
circuit in 
the ’80s. The ’80s and beyond 
being the time when The Beach 
Boys were Reagan’s favorite 
band, released “Kokomo” and 
played ridiculously huge shows 
on the National Mall on the 
fourth of July — the time when 
they nearly destroyed all their 
artistic credibility.

So I used to think the 

recording sessions of what was 
supposed to be Smile were the 
last gasp of a great band before 
they became symbolic and sad, 
and that made the products of 
those sessions tantalizingly 
exciting. There’s a point in 
the piano ballad “Surf’s Up” 
where Brian Wilson sings his 
impressionistic lyrics faster 
and faster, shoving words 
together as he goes, “The glass 
was raised, the fired-roast / 
The fullness of the wine, the 
dim last toasting,” in his high-
pitched voice. Then, much 
more slowly, Wilson sings, “A 
choke of grief heart hardened 
I / Beyond belief a broken man 
too tough to cry” with all the 
weight of this project on his 
vocal chords, all the terrifying 
pressures and wonderful 
ambitions of trying to make 
tangible the sounds he hears 
in his head, of attempting to 
create the greatest album of 
all time. That moment was 
like sand running through my 
fingers — less than 30 seconds 
of absolute beautiful perfection 
that never really came to full 
fruition.

But as it turns out, the 

’70s weren’t really the dark 
ages for the quintessential 
American band. I don’t have 
to imagine what it would’ve 
been like had Brian Wilson 
continued to make music 
with the Beach Boys, because 
there’s a run of relatively little-
known, commercially not very 
successful records that the 
band did in the decade after 
Pet Sounds. A lot of it is terrible 
— like the lazy, drugged-out 
covers of old standards on 
1976’s 15 Big Ones — some of 
it has strong critical standing 
— like 1971’s Surf’s Up, which 
actually does include a version 
of its brilliant title track — but 
to me, the most fascinating 
Beach Boys recording of this 
entire decade is 1977’s Love 
You.

Love You is an alternately 

hilarious, horrifying and 
thrilling journey through 
whatever Brian Wilson was 
thinking at the time. From 
the very beginning, just five 
seconds into “Let Us Go On 
This Way,” it already feels like 
somebody forgot to add more 
to the backing track, with Carl 
Wilson seemingly abandoned 
by the drums and organ, left 
out to dry with just the bass of 
a synthesizer. But somehow, 
it works — by the time all the 

other Beach Boys come in on 
vocals, “Let Us Go On This 
Way” has transformed into 
a stellar lead-off number, an 
energizing joy.

I have no idea how Brian 

Wilson got the other Beach 
Boys to go along with this 
record. I almost imagine him 
with a devious grin on his 
face in the recording studio 
as he watches Mike Love — 
notorious for resisting many 
of Brian’s groundbreaking 
ideas in the ’60s — lay down 
the vocal track for “Johnny 
Carson,” with lines like “he 
speaks in such a manly tone.” 
Then there’s Brian’s slipshod 
“Solar System,” which isn’t 
so much a song as it is what 
you would get if you took a 
six-year-old who liked planets 
and plopped him in front of a 
piano. But Love You also has 
“Love is a Woman,” a touching, 
tender, last call song, “Roller 
Skating Child,” a throwback 
to the early ’60s Beach Boys 
singles, and “Good Time,” 
this complexly arranged, 
deceptively catchy track with 
faux horns augmenting its 
choppy chorus. Love You is 
awesome because it dares you 
to hate it while knowing you’re 
going to keep coming back for 
more.

What’s especially amazing 

about Love You, though, 
is its prescience. It totally 
anticipates new wave 
experiments, arty bands like 
Talking Heads and synth-pop 
in general years before they 
hit the mainstream. Love You 
is the work of musicians who 
just have too much talent 
to make anything bad. It’s a 
Nobel-Prize winning physicist 
drunkenly stumbling out of a 
bar at 2 a.m., still able to solve 
equations you could never hope 
to understand. It’s enthralling 
madness, frustrating as 
hell because there’s so 
much junk and yet so much 
transcendence.

And Love You is actually 

my second huge, mind-
blowing discovery of Beach 
Boys material. The typical 
progression of understanding 
for most music lovers initially 
marks the Beach Boys as the 
guys who did “Surfin’ USA” 
and “California Girls” — great 
bubblegum pop singles — but 
then you listen to Pet Sounds 
in its entirety or you hear 
“Good Vibrations” and realize 
they’re truly one of the all-time 
greats. And now, their story has 
become even more interesting 
to me as I try to navigate the 
part-trainwreck, part-glorious-
epiphany period that is their ’70s.

But you might be wondering 

why the Beach Boys story is 
even relevant in 2015, and 
that’s fair — songs about 
taking pretty girls out on the 
California beach might not 
mean a lot to a large group 
of people. Hell, they don’t 
even mean much to me. But, 
for myself and many others, 
the Beach Boys are the band 
that most reflects old-school 
America and its culture, and to 

get under the surface of their 
work and uncover as much 
as we can is to discover more 
about ourselves and the lives 
we live.

The Beach Boys are one of 

the best bands for constant re-
listening because what’s going 
on beyond the music is always 
wild. There’s almost-painful 
nostalgia and idealism in the 
early work, incomprehensible 
genius in the middle period, 
a mental breakdown, then an 
uncomfortable, uneven burn-
out and now, unfulfilling com-
fort. And as self-absorbed as 
this sounds, I see myself in all 
of this. No, I have no fucking 
clue how Carl Wilson pulled 
off that heart-bursting vocal on 
“God Only Knows.” I can’t even 
begin to explain how some-
thing like “Fun, Fun, Fun” or 
“Help Me, Rhonda” works. But 
as I’m writing, and even just 
as I’m living my everyday life, 
I want to be Brian Wilson. I 
want to think up impossibly 
huge ideas and break my brain 
while I’m trying to stretch the 
limits of what’s possible to 
make them reality.

But I hope I’m not quite 

there yet. I’d like to think 
that I’m slowly making my 
way toward Pet Sounds, some 
piece of work that I help cre-
ate that leaves a lasting mark 
on people, that does some sort 
of positive good for the world. 
I’m listening to and studying 
the Beach Boys so much right 
now because the mystery and 
brilliance of what they did 
deserves obsessive attention 
— needs it, even, if I want to 
figure out its secret. And if I do 
follow that path, whatever it is 
that I do, I just have to hold out 
hope that the people I love will

FILM REVIEW
‘Mockingjay’ offers 
satisfying conclusion

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

For The Daily

Though my “Hunger Games”-

crazed friends can spend hours 
debating whether Peeta or Gale is 
Katniss’s true 
soulmate, they 
can all agree 
that 
“Mock-

ingjay” is by 
far the most 
disappointing 
novel of the 
series. Despite 
the 
novel’s 

failure 
to 

deliver 
the 
con-

clusion 
read-

ers 
desired, 

the film adap-
tation turns this rather subpar 
material into a powerful and 
impactful ending to the fran-
chise.

Picking up where the first 

“Mockingjay” 
film 
left 
off, 

“Mockingjay — Part 2” details 
Katniss’s (Jennifer Lawrence, 
“X-Men: Days of Future Past”) 
journey as she transitions from 
being a pawn in villain Presi-
dent Snow’s (Donald Sutherland, 
“Forsaken”) game to playing by 
her own rules, leading a military 
revolt against the Capital. This 
daunting task is both emotionally 
and physically grueling. The root 
of her emotional stress is Peeta’s 
(Josh Hutcherson, “Red Dawn”) 
mental instability, Gale’s (Liam 
Hemsworth, “The Dressmaker”) 
questionable 
motivations 
and 

actions and, of course, the taunts 
of President Snow. Always the 
epitome of a strong female pro-
tagonist, Katniss runs, jumps 
and roundhouse kicks her way to 
the Capital. With her resurgence 
of inner strength, determination 
and the help of her mostly loyal 
friends, the odds, for once, are 
strongly in her favor.

Among all the reasons fans 

complain about “Mockingjay,” 
the one they most passionately 
rage about is its predictability. 
Collins’s choice of words fails 
to deliver the much needed sus-
pense to keep readers intrigued. 

While Director Francis Law-
rence (“Water for Elephants”) is 
able to hold viewers’ attention 
with the rapid succession of shots 
taken from a variety of angles, 
these quick transitions make it 
impossible to think about what 
could possibly happen next when 
you’re still processing what just 
happened two seconds ago. His 
use of shadows also effectively 
enhances the suspenseful mood 
by making it impossible to dis-
cern what is going to attack the 
team next, and when.

Authors can write effectively 

enough that readers can form 
a deep connection with one, or 
many characters, but nothing 
compares to seeing real people’s 
interactions 
and 
expressions 

of emotion. In the novel, Peeta 
just seems like a whiny guy with 
some mental issues. In his best 
“Hunger Games” performance 
yet, Hutchinson showcases the 
true struggle Peeta goes through 
as he slowly transitions from his 
drugged delusion and enters 
the real world. He is often seen 
gripping his head in frustration, 
and is obsessed with asking his 
comrades whether certain facts 
or memories are “real” or “not 
real.” Peeta’s audible discom-
fort along with the close-up 
shots revealing his pained facial 
expressions allow us to feel the 
same sense of vexation and con-
fusion he does.

Of course, it’s impossible to 

review any “Hunger Games” 
film without discussing about 
Katniss. With words more sig-
nificant than the threat of a 
bullet, she’s able to effectively 
change the minds of the brain-
washed opposition, and, even 
more impressively, her foil Peeta. 
Indeed, Katniss has what many 
girls want — two very attractive 
men fighting for her love — but 
(unlike a certain other popular 
young adult franchises) choos-
ing between them is the least 
of her worries. By placing her 
focus on destroying the notori-
ous President Snow and improv-
ing the overall quality of life for 
everyone in Panem, she helps the 
film pass the Bechdel test with 
flying colors. Further enhancing 
this film’s emphasis on the femi-
nist ideology is the fact that the 
three most powerful leaders are 
all female — Katniss, self pro-
claimed “president” of the reb-
els Coin (Julianne Moore, “Still 
Alice”) and Commander Paylor 
(Patina Miller, “Madame Secre-
tary”).

While Tributes (an oddly dark 

name for the series’ obsessed 
fans) are often overjoyed when 
their eyes finally glance over the 
last word of “Mockingjay,” they 
may be heartbroken as the end 
credits appear on screen, signify-
ing the conclusion of a woman’s 
quest to change the world.

FILM REVIEW
Giggly ‘Night Before’

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

Seth Rogen and his writing part-

ner, Evan Goldberg, have had such 
a great track record with raunchy 
comedy mov-
ies 
that 
by 

now, it seems 
difficult 
to 

know 
where 

to go next. In 
many 
ways, 

2013’s 
“This 

is the End,” in 
which 
Rogen 

and his fre-
quent costars 
like 
Jonah 

Hill played fictionalized versions 
of themselves during the apoca-
lypse, was the gloriously over-the-
top culmination of Rogen’s steady 
growth to comedic fame. Viewers 
watched Jonah Hill get raped by a 
“Rosemary’s Baby”-esque demon, 
and shortly after, the massive crim-
son penis of a CGI-rendered Satan 
got sliced in half by a beam trans-
porting Rogen to Heaven. Where 
do you go from there?

Judging by his acclaimed work 

in “Steve Jobs,” Rogen is following 
in Hill’s footsteps and moving into 
more dramatic roles. In their new 
film “The Night Before,” though, 
Rogen and Goldberg thankfully 
show that they still have an abun-
dance of heart to lend to raunchy 
comedies, even if their well of gut-
busting jokes isn’t as deep as it used 
to be.

Primarily scripted by Goldberg 

and director Jonathan Levine, who 
worked with Rogen and Joseph 
Gordon-Levitt in “50/50,” “The 
Night Before” tells the story of 
three best friends who have cel-
ebrated Christmas together every 
year since Ethan’s (Gordon-Levitt, 
“The Walk”) parents died. This 
year, Ethan finds tickets to the leg-
endary Nutcracker Ball, a mysteri-
ous Christmas party the friends 
have been seeking for years, and 
the film takes place over the course 

of one night as they try to find the 
party.

All three leads are given their 

own individual character arcs. 
Ethan pines after his ex-girlfriend 
Diana (Lizzy Caplan, “The Inter-
view”), who broke up with him 
because he refused to commit and 
meet her parents. Isaac (Rogen), 
whose wife (Jillian Bell, “22 Jump 
Street”) is expecting a child, strug-
gles to cope with his impending 
fatherhood. Chris (Anthony Mack-
ie, “Captain America: The Winter 
Soldier”), a steroid-using football 
player, enjoys his newfound fame, 
though Ethan secretly resents his 
shameless self-promotion.

Toward the end of the film, 

Ethan becomes furious that his 
friends have split up to selfishly 
deal with their own problems and 
toss aside their Christmas-fueled 
camaraderie. Isaac looks for Sarah 
(Mindy Kaling, “The Mindy Proj-
ect”), who has the phone where 
Isaac recorded his deepest fatherly 
insecurities while under the influ-
ence. Chris searches for a crazed 
fan who stole from him. Ethan’s 
stubborn attempts to secure the 
bond that the three friends have 
had since high school is a poignant 
character motivation, especially 
considering Ethan’s dissatisfaction 
with his professional and romantic 
life. Like Levine’s “50/50,” and like 
Rogen and Goldberg’s other films, 
“The Night Before” locates its heart 
in lasting male friendships, and the 
threat of those friendships disinte-
grating provides the conflict for the 
movie.

However, “The Night Before” 

struggles a bit because of that 
same insistence on splitting up the 
friends. The screenwriters’ dedica-
tion to giving them individual arcs 
necessitates hitting a number of 
required beats in each character’s 
progression. None of these arcs are 
particularly novel; Ethan’s struggle 
to grow up and commit and Isaac’s 
qualms about fatherhood are both 
characteristic of practically every 
Rogen character since “Knocked 

Up.” One can’t help but imagine an 
alternate version of the movie in 
which simplistic character motives 
are thrown out in favor of a simple 
scavenger hunt-style search for the 
Nutcracker Ball.

The movie is low on the huge 

belly laughs that filled movies like 
“This is the End” and “Neighbors.” 
Still, it’s consistently giggle-wor-
thy, especially thanks to countless 
funny supporting roles, from come-
dians like Caplan, Kaling and Ilana 
Glazer (“Broad City”) to surprising 
standouts Michael Shannon (“Man 
of Steel”) and Miley Cyrus. Mov-
ies like this can often feel lazy, like 
they’re just an excuse for a bunch of 
comedian friends to hang out — but 
when the friends are this funny, it’s 
hard to protest.

Aside from heart, what keeps 

the comparatively low laugh cali-
ber from being distracting is the 
movie’s wicked fast pace. Com-
edies don’t get a lot of praise for 
their structure and pacing, but 
“The Night Before” is plotted ruth-
lessly. Ethan, Isaac and Chris’s arcs 
are woven together well, and small 
lines from early on pay off with 
big punchlines later in the movie 
(especially with a particular char-
acter nicknamed the “Messiah”). 
The three main appearances of 
Mr. Green (Shannon) especially 
showcase this eye for structure. He 
evolves from a creepy drug dealer 
in a conversation with Chris to an 
agent of hallucination for Isaac, 
ending as a surprising source of 
insight for Ethan. There’s a relent-
less momentum to the film as it 
builds towards its inevitable climax 
at the Nutcracker Ball, and viewers 
remain engaged throughout.

“The Night Before” isn’t a flaw-

less comedy film, and it never really 
shocks or challenges audience 
perceptions of what a Seth Rogen 
movie can be. Still, not every com-
edy needs to feature satanic nudity 
and apocalyptic drug trips. Some-
times, Joseph Gordon-Levitt sing-
ing “Wrecking Ball” with Miley 
Cyrus is enough.

FILM REVIEW
‘Creed’ a knockout

By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Senior Arts Editor

JACOB RICH

Daily Film Editor

One of the biggest criticisms 

of our generation (the “Milenni-
als,” read that with an appropri-
ately derogatory snarl) is that our 
art is derivative. Blockbusters, 
some would posit, are becoming 
less original and are too reliant 
on repackaging old stories, char-
acters and franchises and selling 
them as new. 
We’ve 
heard 

someone 
call 

our generation 
the 
“remix” 

generation: 
We’re just try-
ing 
to 
recap-

ture the magic 
of “Star Wars,” 
Marvel comics 
and ’80s action pictures, stuff our 
current filmmakers liked when 
they were kids. 

And yet, “Creed” is something 

special, 
something 
different. 

Rather than churn out another 
soulless franchise reboot like this 
year’s actual horseshit “Termina-
tor Genisys” and “Fantastic Four,” 
young director Ryan Coogler 
(“Fruitvale Station”) and his crew 
created the best kind of sequel, 
one that understands exactly what 
made the original series so popu-
lar but has something completely 
original to say. It’s both literally 
and metaphorically about stand-
ing in the shadow of something 
great and finding your own iden-
tity in acknowledging the past. 
“Creed” stands as a shining exam-
ple of how to iterate with power, 
passion and originality. 

“Creed” is the story of Adonis 

Johnson (Michael B. Jordan, 
“Fantastic Four”), the illegitimate 
son of deceased “Rocky” cham-
pion Apollo Creed. We begin with 
a brief, but powerful vignette 
that says more with imagery than 
words: a young Adonis (Alex Hen-

derson, “Empire”) is adopted from 
juvenile detention by Apollo’s 
widow (Phylicia Rashad, “Good 
Deeds”) into a life of luxury. The 
rags-to-riches narrative of the 
original “Rocky” is abandoned 
here — it’s not about that anymore. 
In its place is a narrative about a 
man caught between two worlds: 
He can coast through life in luxu-
ry, or strive for something greater 
but risk his name overshadowing 
his skill and his worth. This is a 
thoroughly Millenial narrative.

We follow Adonis as he strives 

to create his own legacy as a boxer. 
Michael B. Jordan is astounding 
here, turning in a performance 
that’s visceral and emotional. 
He’s paired perfectly with Tessa 
Thompson (“Dear White People”) 
as love interest and musician Bian-
ca (she produced her own music 
for the film), whose own struggle 
with degenerative hearing loss, a 
war against human deterioration 
and the ticking clock, parallels a 
boxer’s perfectly. 

And Sylvester Stallone (“The 

Expendables 3”) turns in his 
best performance since the first 
“Rocky.” He understands the 
mythological 
Rocky 
character 

as a human so deeply, and deftly 
meshes the character’s hardship 
and grief with his own aging vis-
age. Rocky has been beaten in the 
ring, sure, but life has knocked 
him down, too, taking his wife 
Adrian and friend Paulie. He ritu-
ally visits their graves and reads 
them the paper. He lives modest-
ly and honestly, but he seems to 
have accepted that his glory days 
are behind him, as he awaits the 
day he might join his loved ones 
in the ground. Gone is the man 
who once said, “It ain’t about how 
hard you hit. It’s about how hard 
you can get hit and keep moving 
forward.” It is only the youthful 
injection from Adonis that gives 
Rocky the spark to keep going. 
Stallone, so restrained and con-
templative, gives one of the year’s 
finest performances. But excellent 
humanistic acting from all per-

formers drives the emotional core 
of “Creed” — MBJ, Thompson and 
Stallone should all be nominated 
for awards for this film.

And that’s to say nothing about 

the boxing itself. The midpoint 
of “Creed” features the single 
most impressively filmed boxing 
match the movies have ever seen, 
a one-shot masterpiece in visceral 
choreography that is pure cin-
ematic magic (meaning we have 
no idea how they did it). Cinema-
tographer Maryse Alberti (“The 
Wrestler”) also manages to nail 
the sportscast-like mise-en-scene 
of the original “Rocky” ’s fights in 
the climactic bout of “Creed,” a 
fight so exciting it repeatedly elic-
ited guttural squeals and “oh-my-
gods” from the filmgoers sitting in 
the audience. 

The moment of catharsis in 

this film is a sequence of rousing 
excitement to the level we have 
not felt in the cinema in years. 
Initially, it parallels the famous 
hoodie-sporting run through the 
streets of Philadelphia in the orig-
inal “Rocky.” Then, in a cacoph-
ony of roaring minibike engines, 
Childish Gambino and Vince 
Staples, it blazes its own trail. You 
have to witness this.

Early in the film, Adonis sits in 

his mother’s mansion and plays 
old clips of the Balboa-Creed 
fights on YouTube through a pro-
jector. He rises, approaches the 
screen and assumes a fighter’s 
stance, and then he shadowboxes 
his father. “Creed” strings togeth-
er two hours and 15 minutes 
of images like these: powerful, 
emotional, human. There is not a 
second of this film that is wasted. 
Every shot is beautiful. Every line 
is meaningful. It’s romantic. It’s 
brutal. It’s honest. 

“Creed” is a film about pur-

pose that justifies itself. Against 
insurmountable odds, Adonis and 
Coogler make names for them-
selves.

And just consider this: “Creed” 

is so good that it took two writers 
to review it.

Jim Harbaugh faces a tough task to get his team back atop the Big Ten.
The state of 
the rivalry

Y

ears have now passed 
since Lloyd Carr and Jim 
Tressel led the Michigan 

and Ohio 
State football 
teams, 
respectively. 
One fall 
Saturday 
during those 
days, I asked 
my dad a 
question: 
“Dad, 
when does 
Michigan 
play Ohio State?”

“The last game of the season,” 

he said. “Always the last game of 
the season, because it’s for the 
Big Ten championship.”

It has rarely been that way 

since 2007.

Every single year during 

the “Ten Year War” from 1969 
to 1978, Michigan and Ohio 
State played in the last game 
of the season for the Big Ten 
championship — meaning each 
could clinch at least a share of 
the title with a win. For 15 of Bo 
Schembechler’s 21 years leading 
the Wolverines — and six of 
Lloyd Carr’s 12 — the stakes were 
the same. That was the way they 
wanted it.

“The only way to go in the 

(Big Ten) is to come down 
to Michigan-Ohio State,” 
Schembechler said after his team 
beat the Buckeyes to win the Big 
Ten in 1986. “Anytime you play 
this game, there are so many 
things hanging in the balance. I 
just hope it stays like that.”

Eight years, five head coaches 

and one national championship 
(between both teams) after Carr 
left, it hasn’t happened again.

This weekend, Michigan and 

Ohio State fans anticipated a 
return to their old tradition: the 
annual, smashmouth, Bo-versus-
Woody slugfest to decide the Big 
Ten championship, which they 
haven’t played for since 2007.

Instead, there were a 

couple of wrinkles when the 
Wolverines and Buckeyes 
battled Saturday at Michigan 
Stadium. First, the game wasn’t 
much of a slugfest — Ohio 
State rolled, 42-13, in the most 
lopsided matchup not involving 
Rich Rodriguez since 1968.

Second, there was more to the 

story: The winner didn’t win the 
Big Ten title, or even the East 
division. The winner had to turn 
on the TV and root for Penn 
State to upset Michigan State in 
East Lansing.

The Nittany Lions didn’t, so 

Michigan and Ohio State will 
be sitting at home Saturday 
watching the Spartans play 
Iowa for the conference 
championship.

This is the new reality for 

these teams. As much as they 
long for a second coming of the 
“Ten Year War,” the Big Ten 
doesn’t work that way anymore. 
Even if the cards align, a win 
in “The Game” gets you only 
the right to play in the Big Ten 
Championship Game.

It’s clear by now that Mark 

Dantonio’s Michigan State team 

isn’t going anywhere. The jury 
is still out on James Franklin at 
Penn State. Other teams could 
play spoiler every so often, too.

Michigan’s struggles under 

Rodriguez and Brady Hoke, 
as well as Ohio State’s NCAA 
sanctions, have shaken things 
up over the past decade. This 
year, both were near their top 
form, coming into their matchup 
both ranked in the top 10 for the 
first time since the “Game of the 
Century” in 2006.

Even in spite of that success, 

the Spartans stole the spotlight. 
They, too, will finish ahead of 
Michigan in the standings. In 
each of the five years the Big 
Ten Championship Game has 
existed, the Wolverines have sat 
at home and watched. To make 
matters worse, at least one of 
their rivals has been in four of 
those games.

This year, two roadblocks 

stood between Michigan and 
its first Big Ten title since 2004. 
After Saturday, one seemed 
tougher than the other.

Michigan competed with 

Michigan State this season 
before losing, of course, on a 
fluke play at the end. For all the 
hype surrounding Harbaugh and 
Meyer throughout the past year, 
the Spartans emerged at the end, 
knocking off both on the final 
plays of both games.

Then there are the Buckeyes, 

who showed Saturday they’re 
still further ahead of the 
Wolverines. Ohio State rolled 
over Michigan for 376 rushing 
yards at 6.8 per carry, scoring 42 
points for the third straight year.

The Wolverines knew “The 

Game” would be a measuring 
stick at the end of the season, 
whether they came in 0-11, 11-0 
or 9-2.

They have made more 

progress this season than they 
showed Saturday, but with that 
comes a letdown from the high 
expectations they set.

“Very proud of the team, the 

way they’ve worked, the way 
they’ve progressed,” Harbaugh 
said Saturday. “We’ll just stay at 
that. Closed quite a bit of ground. 
Still more ground to close on, but 
knowing our team, they’ll stay 
with it.”

They’ll have to, because 

winning the Big Ten has never 
been tougher. The football 
world tried all year to boil the 
conference down to Harbaugh 
vs. Meyer, but the rest of the 
league will have something 
to say about that. It won’t be 
that easy, as it was with Bo vs. 
Woody, or even as easy as it was 
10 years ago.

I didn’t realize my dad was 

overstating it when he told me 
Michigan played Ohio State 
in the last game of the season 
for the Big Ten championship. 
It really did happen that way, 
pretty much every year.

But those days are long gone, 

and there’s a long way to go for 
the two rivals to recapture them.

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
Five Things We Learned

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

By the end of Saturday’s game, 

most of the remaining fans in the 
Big House wore red, and their 
voices were louder than those of 
the Michigan fans. The game, a 
42-13 victory by Ohio State, was 
nothing short of a beatdown.

And with that, the Wolverines’ 

surprising season ended with 
a thud. Here are five things 
we learned from Saturday’s 
blowout:

1. Michigan still has ground to 

gain on its rivals.

Entering 
Saturday’s 
game, 

the gap between Ohio State and 
Michigan, at least in the College 
Football Playoff rankings, was 
razor-thin. The Wolverines were 
ranked 10th in the country, and 
the Buckeyes were ranked eighth.

Ohio State’s superiority, it 

appears, is actually quite large. 
The Buckeyes bested Michigan 
in nearly every facet of the 
game Saturday. They rushed 
for 369 yards, running the ball 
mercilessly through the middle 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense. 

Michigan didn’t have a prayer.

The 
gap 
between 
the 

Wolverines 
and 
their 
other 

chief rival, Michigan State, was 
smaller when they played last 
month. The Spartans won the 
game on the infamous botched 
punt, a play that wouldn’t have 
happened again if they simulated 
the game a thousand more times.

But Michigan State has surged 

ever since that near defeat. The 
Spartans will play for a Big Ten 
championship next weekend in 
Indianapolis, a chance Michigan 
hasn’t had since the league 
championship game was created 
five years ago.

The Wolverines still have a 

long way to go.

2. Ohio State is still very good.

Reports of the Buckeyes’ 

demise 
after 
their 
loss 
to 

Michigan State last weekend 
were 
debunked 
by 
their 

performance 
Saturday. 
Ohio 

State looked like a very good 
football team, not one that was 
riddled by turmoil in the locker 
room and dissatisfaction with 
the coaching staff.

The 
Buckeyes 
closed 
out 

Michigan easily in the second 
half, outscoring the Wolverines, 
28-3. If any Michigan fans were 
hoping Ohio State was on the 
decline, they were disappointed 
Saturday.

3. The injuries to Michigan’s 
defensive line were too much 

to overcome.

The Wolverines lost three 

players on their defensive line to 
season-ending injuries during 
the course of the 2015 campaign. 
First came sophomore defensive 
tackle Bryan Mone, who broke 
his ankle during fall camp. 

Then came senior defensive 
end 
Mario 
Ojemudia, 
who 

suffered an Achilles injury 
against 
Maryland. 
Redshirt 

junior defensive tackle Ryan 
Glasgow rounded out the trio 
by suffering a pectoral injury 
in Michigan’s blowout victory 
against Rutgers.

At first, the injuries were 

manageable. 
The 
Wolverines 

recorded three straight shutouts 
earlier in the season, and the 
front seven played a large role. 
But after Glasgow’s injury, the 
depth in the front seven started 
to wear thin. 

Michigan allowed more than 

300 yards on the ground in two 
of the last three games of the 
regular season. The Wolverines 
capitalized on Indiana’s porous 
defense on the first occasion, but 
that wasn’t the case against Ohio 
State. Michigan couldn’t score 
frequently enough to keep the 
game close. Injuries to the front 
seven made their mark.

4. Jake Rudock can’t have a 

happy ending.

Rudock didn’t deserve the 

fate that befell him in the fourth 
quarter of Saturday’s game. His 
shoulder injury, courtesy of a 
crushing blow from high school 
teammate Joey Bosa, ended 
his regular-season career at 
Michigan.

For 
the 
last 
month 
or 

so, Rudock had carried the 
Wolverines. When the running 
game wasn’t working and the 
defense struggled, Rudock was 
sharp. He surpassed 250 passing 
yards for the fourth straight 
week Saturday, marking a sharp 
turn from the beginning of 
the season when his frequent 
interceptions hurt Michigan.

Rudock isn’t unfamiliar with 

sad endings. He ended his career 
at Iowa on the bench, choosing 
to transfer instead of being the 
backup.

On a day that started off with 

his family receiving more cheers 
than any other on Senior Day, 
the end wasn’t what Rudock had 
hoped for.

5. Bold prediction: Michigan 
will win in either Columbus 
or East Lansing next season.

The 
Wolverines 
face 
a 

daunting schedule next season. 
They will travel to Columbus, 
East Lansing and Iowa City to 
face teams currently ranked in 
the top 10. If Michigan loses 
all three of those contests, 
as might be expected, the 
Wolverines’ record would not 
reflect any improvement from 
this season’s.

But Michigan showed that it 

had a knack for hanging close 
in road games this season. Even 
at Utah, the lone road game the 
Wolverines 
lost, 
Michigan’s 

margin of defeat was just seven. 
The team did not lose a single 
Big Ten road game and, more 
impressively, persevered in close 
road contests.

A punch in the gut

T

hey unfurled the sign in 
the middle of the fourth 
quarter, with Ohio State 

leading Michigan, 42-13.

Generally, signs are harmless 

pieces of 
paper that 
can be 
ripped to 
shreds by the 
human hand 
in a matter 
of seconds. 
But if a 
sign could 
ever punch 
someone in 
the gut and 
knock an entire fan base to the 
ground, it was this one.

In the middle of the Buckeye 

fan section in the upper half 
of the south end zone, an Ohio 
State fan named Rocky showed 
off the sign. Its background was 
scarlet, the writing on top white.

“WELCOME HOME COACH 

HARBAUGH.”

Around the sign, Ohio State 

fans chanted “OH-IO” and 
revealed that, no, they still 
do not give a damn about the 
whole state of Michigan.

But that sign. Ones with 

similar messages have appeared 
all over Ann Arbor this fall, on 
ATM machines, barber shops 
and restaurants. Michigan 
was back, baby. And it was all 
because of Harbaugh, the savior 
who grabbed the Wolverines 
from the fiery depths of a 5-7 
season and lifted them to 9-3.

This sign, though, was 

different. It was an open 
mocking of Michigan fans in 
their weakest moment.

Much of the last year had 

been like a dream. First, 
Harbaugh came to Ann Arbor 
last December, defying logic 
and turning away NFL money 
to follow his heart. Then, the 
Wolverines started to put 
things together on the football 
field in ways nobody imagined, 
shutting out three consecutive 
opponents on their way to a 5-1 
record heading into a matchup 
with Michigan State.

That game, particularly its 

ending, was no dream. But 
like the rest of the season, it 
wasn’t rooted in reality. It was a 
nightmare.

Saturday was no dream, either. 

It was a dose of reality, a bucket 
of water to the face. The sign 

hanging proudly in Michigan 
Stadium was the final blow.

Michigan, for the first time 

this season, looked completely 
out of sync in most facets of the 
game. The rush defense, among 
the best in the country, could 
not have stopped a 5-year old 
from getting into Rick’s. The 
rush offense couldn’t do much 
of anything, either. Players not 
named Jabrill Peppers rushed 
for 28 yards on 18 carries.

Urban Meyer, the coach 

Harbaugh was supposed to battle 
in close games for the foreseeable 
future — like Bo Schembechler 
did with Woody Hayes decades 
ago — won the first battle 
decisively. His team pounded 
the ball down the middle of 
Michigan’s defense, beating 
Harbaugh at his own game.

Across from Meyer, on the 

other sideline, was Jake Rudock 
— the guy who has improbably 
taken his place beside Harbaugh 
as the second-most beloved 
Wolverine. He finished the final 
regular-season game of his 
college career on the bench. He 
was smacked by his former high 
school teammate Joey Bosa and 
suffered a shoulder injury.

Transfer quarterback John 

O’Korn, another St. Thomas 
Aquinas alum and possibly 
Michigan’s next quarterback, 
stayed with Rudock while 
he was on the training table. 
Shane Morris spent some time 
consoling Rudock, too. Graham 
Glasgow and Ben Braden came 
over for hugs and words of 
encouragement, and Patrick 
Kugler gave him a pat on the 
head.

But all Rudock could do was 

watch, his left arm seemingly 
immobile, as his team continued 
to collapse. Bosa struck again, 
tipping a pass from backup 
quarterback Wilton Speight 
and intercepting it. He rumbled 
to Michigan’s nine-yard line. 
The outcome had already been 
decided.

Harbaugh, the man whose 

every move has been followed 
since his hire, didn’t say much 
after the game. Like he has every 
week, he said the team’s focus 
remains on getting better and 
improving next time. The ground 
between Michigan and its rivals 
has gotten smaller, he said.

The outcome wasn’t one the 

Wolverines expected at the 
half. Then, in what seems like a 
lifetime ago, Michigan trailed 
by just four. The Wolverines’ 
offense matched the Buckeyes’, 
and Michigan’s defense stopped 
Ohio State on occasion.

“We felt like we could win 

it,” Harbaugh said.

Few things could have put 

a damper on the Wolverines’ 
season. As Chris Wormley said 
after the game, nobody believed 
in Michigan going into the 
season, except for the players 
and coaches on the team. But 
somehow, the Wolverines gave 
their fans hope and a top-10 
ranking entering the final week 
of the regular season.

Then came a 29-point loss to 

their most bitter rival.

Welcome home, Coach 

Harbaugh. There’s still work to 
be done.

Ohio State proved its superiority with another dominant win over Michigan.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Michigan received a strict wake-up call, ending a promising season with a 42-13 loss to Ohio State on Saturday.


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

November 30, 2015 — 3B

A journey from 

boys to men

John Beilein, having just 

watched his team suffer a 
16-point loss on its home floor, 
offered 
a fairly 
damning 
assessment 
of the reason 
for the 
opponent’s 
superiority 
Nov. 20.

“They 

looked 
like men 
out there,” 
Beilein said, referring to the 
Xavier squad that sent fans 
packing early from Crisler Center 
with a dominant, 86-70 victory. 
“Their bodies are strong. They’re 
quick. They went right at us.”

If Xavier looked like a group 

of men — calm, collected, 
physical, confident — Michigan 
looked like anything but. The 
Wolverines knew what was 
coming that night but couldn’t 
stop Musketeer big men Jalen 
Reynolds and James Farr.

Those two might as well 

have walked the crowd through 
a PowerPoint presentation 
detailing the multitude of 
reasons Michigan wasn’t ready 
to compete down low. Their 
performance ended up being 
even more demonstrative.

The Wolverines’ bigs — a 

motley crew of Ricky Doyle, 
Moritz Wagner, D.J. Wilson and 
Mark Donnal — are “trying to 
learn to play hard and smart,” 
Beilein said. Against Xavier, 
they were neither. None of the 
four has more than a year’s 
experience in college basketball, 
and it showed. Michigan was 
outrebounded, 47-29. Farr 
and Reynolds combined for 
23 points. Donnal and Doyle 
were plagued by foul trouble 
throughout.

The same was true 

Wednesday against No. 18 
Connecticut, a team that relies 
less on scoring in the paint 
but proved just as capable of 
outmuscling the Wolverines. 
In its 74-60 loss, Michigan was 
outrebounded, 42-31.

The Wolverines were already 

in the Bahamas for that game, 
the first round of a remarkably 
competitive Battle 4 Atlantis 
tournament. As it turned out, all 
they needed to right the ship was 
a few more days in paradise.

Maybe it was a few rounds on 

the water slides, an afternoon by 
the pool or a hearty Thanksgiving 
meal, but by Thursday night, 
the Wolverines had shaken off 
the loss. They played like men 
Thursday, taking Charlotte to 
task in a 102-47 laugher. 

No, Charlotte isn’t close to the 

caliber of opposition provided 
by Connecticut or Xavier. But 
Michigan survived on the boards 
and maintained its composure 
against a physical, talented 
Texas team the next night, too, 
and telltale signs of the growth 
Beilein discusses so often 
appeared left and right.

For a 6-foot-10 athlete, 

Wagner looks young — younger, 
if it’s possible for someone 
his size, than his 18 years. But 
his boyishness disappeared 
against Charlotte. The German 
freshman scored 19 points on 

Thursday, and added seven more 
the next night against Texas. 
More importantly, he made 
progress on the glass, pulling 
down four rebounds in the first 
season he’s ever spent actually 
thinking about rebounding.

“Europeans, all they do is 

teach everybody to play like a 
guard,” Beilein said. “He’s got 
such great intuitions for the game 
that he should be able to figure 
out where some of the basketballs 
are coming off. Four rebounds 
today is big for him. As he grows, 
we need him to keep doing that.”

It won’t be until after the 

coming offseason — when 
Wagner has time to focus on 
bolstering his slender 225-
pound frame — that he’ll be able 
to match up physically with 
Big Ten forwards. Until then, 
Wagner can continue to use his 
creative, energetic style in the 
paint to provide a change of pace 
that, if nothing else, will make it 
tougher for opponents to adjust 
to Doyle when he checks back in.

Doyle, of course, is plenty big. 

He’s 25 pounds heavier than 
Wagner, all of it muscle. He 
needs to learn how to be physical 
on defense without fouling, and 
to play longer stretches in which 
he makes a bigger impact on the 
boards. He’s ahead of Wagner in 
terms of physicality, but Wagner 
has already surpassed him in 
terms of craftiness in the paint.

It’s easy to envision the pair 

growing into a lethal one-two 
punch at center for Michigan. 
Wagner’s speed and enthusiasm, 
combined with Doyle’s size, 
provide enough of a stylistic 
difference to make the forward 
play unpredictable. Even Wilson, 
a redshirt freshman, caught 
his coach’s eye Thursday with 
a step-across dunk that Beilein 
said typically gets blocked. 
Add him for a few minutes per 
game, and the Wolverines’ play 
becomes three-deep and three-
dimensional.

Doyle spent the 2014-15 

season proving that he could be 
more productive than Donnal 
at the ‘5’ spot. Why Donnal, and 
not Doyle, started the season’s 
first three games is something 
of a mystery. Beilein used the 
word “overmatched” to describe 
Donnal’s performance against 
Xavier. There’s not much else to 
say, but Donnal and Michigan 
learned an early lesson.

Beilein doesn’t seem to mind 

too much. Among his preferred 
sayings is this: “If you’re gonna 
lose, lose early.”

The Wolverines are taking 

the recommendation to heart, 
as they did in 2013-14. They 
started 4-4 that season and came 
seconds away from an Elite Eight 
win over Kentucky.

Michigan has plenty of work 

to do before it reaches that 
team’s level, or comes anywhere 
close. Being a team that “looks 
like men” is an obvious first step.

The Wolverines aren’t a team 

that looks like men — yet. But 
they’re farther down the road 
than they were a week ago. Even 
in paradise, there’s no better 
motivator than getting beaten up.

A ticket to paradise for fans

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

PARADISE 
ISLAND, 
The 

Bahamas — For a handful of 
Michigan 
fans, 
Thanksgiving 

turkey was served with a side of 
college hoops this year.

Andy and Chrissy Schoonover 

— both of whom graduated from 
the University in 2005 — have 
been attending the Michigan 
men’s basketball team’s tropical 
Thanksgiving-time tournaments 
since 2011, when they went to the 
Maui Invitational in Hawaii.

The couple went to watch the 

Wolverines play in the Puerto 
Rico Tip-Off tournament in 
San Juan two years ago, and in 
April of this year made plans 
to catch Michigan play in the 
Battle 4 Atlantis tournament 
in the Bahamas. There was 
only one problem: Shortly after 
making arrangements at the 
resort, Chrissy found out she was 
expecting.

“We didn’t book a flight until 

Thursday — this past Thursday,” 
Andy said. “Because we didn’t 
think our doctor would let us 
come.”

Chrissy’s due date is Dec. 30, 

but even the couple’s first child 
wasn’t going to stop them from 
supporting their first love: the 
Wolverines.

“(Our doctor) wouldn’t give us 

her blessing,” Chrissy said. “But 
she said that I was healthy and 
so was the baby, so that meant we 
got a flight.”

So, bags packed, the couple 

left from their home in Lansing 
and headed to warmer weather 
accompanied 
by 
Chrissy’s 

mom and aunt. Chrissy’s mom 
was sure to remind her that 
“Grandma was going to be 
here,” just in case there was an 
early delivery.

With Michigan’s first two 

games of the tournament tipping 
off at 9:30 p.m., the family had 
the opportunity to relax by the 
pool during the day and even ran 
into a few Wolverines around the 

resort.

“(Andy) got a picture with 

Spike 
(Albrecht),” 
Chrissy 

said. “And I got a picture with 
(Moritz Wagner) on the beach. 
… He looked like he was more 
surprised to get a picture with 
me than I was with him. It was 
so cute.”

Basketball in the Bahamas was 

just part of a week of Michigan 
sports 
the 
Schoonovers 
had 

planned. 
The 
couple 
hoped 

Michigan would win its first 
game and play in the winner’s 
bracket — guaranteeing an early 
game Friday, meaning they could 
watch all three games. They 
booked their return for Friday 
night so that they could be back 
for the Michigan-Ohio State 
football game on Saturday.

But 
Michigan 
lost 
to 

Connecticut on Wednesday, and 
after a Thursday win against 
Charlotte, it was slated for a 7 p.m. 
tip off on Friday. So the couple 
caught just the first two games, 
and took off Friday night to make 
it back for the football game.

They said they loved the 

Atlantis Paradise Island Resort, 
but their trip to Maui was tough 

to top.

“Maui was better,” Andy said. 

“We did a Nebraska football 
game on Saturday, left Sunday 
to go to Maui, had basketball 
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
left Thanksgiving night to get 
back for the Ohio State game 
Saturday — won four of the five 
games, so that’s ultimate.”

Not every Michigan fan had 

the foresight to get back in time 
for the football game on Saturday. 
When Jay Clothier was planning 
his family’s trip to the Battle 4 
Atlantis, he didn’t think to check 
the football schedule, so they 
flew back Saturday during the 
Michigan-Ohio State game.

“We got so excited and blinded 

by this, I didn’t even realize it was 
the same weekend,” Clothier said.

Clothier, who graduated from 

the University in 1990, was part 
of a group that traveled from 
Michigan to the Bahamas for the 
tournament.

The 
trip 
was 
originally 

his 
nephew’s 
idea. 
Carson 

Butterfield, 14, thought up the 
vacation when he was watching 
the Battle 4 Atlantis last year. 
When the field was announced 

for this year and Michigan was 
included, Carson went to his 
grandmother Gaye Butterfield 
and suggested the trip.

Gaye, 
a 
1965 
University 

graduate, was on board. So were 
her sons, Mike and Dave, who 
graduated from the University in 
1989 and 1991, respectively. The 
trip quickly turned into a family 
vacation with 24 aunts, uncles 
and cousins in total.

Mike 
Butterfield, 
Carson’s 

dad, was a student manager for 
the 1988-89 NCAA championship 
team and occasionally traveled 
with the Wolverines, mostly to 
other Big Ten cities, so getting to 
watch Michigan in the Bahamas 
was a special treat.

“This is a heck of lot better,” he 

said. “Let me tell you.”

With two nightcap games, the 

family had plenty of time to hang 
out by the pool, ride the water 
slides and spend a little time in 
the casino.

For Gaye, it was the perfect 

mix of family time and watching 
her alma mater.

“I don’t get all excited about 

whether they win or lose,” she 
said. “It’s just nice to be there.”

Wolverines beat Oral Roberts

Michigan’s offense 
fails to ignite but 
still wins sixth 
straight game

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball 
team 
scored 
119 

points with ease last Monday, 
but that same team struggled to 
put up just 61 on Sunday.

The Wolverines put up their 

lowest first-half scoring output 
of 
the 

season 
with 
31 

points, but 
still managed to notch a 61-44 
victory over Oral Roberts (3-3).

Michigan’s starting guards 

— 
junior 
Siera 
Thompson, 

sophomore Katelynn Flaherty 
and senior Madison Ristovski — 
had trouble finding any success 
from the field early. The trio 
combined to shoot 2-for-14 in 
the first half.

The starting trio’s scoring 

began to pick up in the second 
half, as they looked to drive to 
the basket rather than strictly 
taking outside shots. Flaherty, 
Thompson and Ristovski scored 
10 points from layups after the 
half, and 26 of the Wolverines’ 
30 second-half points came in 
the paint.

“We’re not just shooters,” 

Thompson said. “We can go to 
the basket as well. We thought if 
the shots aren’t falling, we’ll get 
points in a different way.”

Thompson did score points 

from the free-throw line in 
the opening half for Michigan 
(6-0). The guard challenged 
the Golden Eagles’ guard Bria 
Pitts defensively, forcing Oral 
Roberts’ leading scorer to the 
bench when she picked up 
her third personal foul with 
6:30 remaining in the second 
quarter. Thompson ended the 
half leading all guards with 
seven points, four of which were 
at the line.

With Pitts off the floor, the 

Wolverines held the Golden 

Eagles to just six points in the 
second quarter — forcing them 
to go scoreless for more than 
four minutes.

“It was a different game than 

what we normally see from our 
team,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico. “Even though we 
weren’t scoring and making 
shots that we normally make, 
the way that 
we defended, 
hung together 
and 
stayed 

together (was 
impressive). It 
looked 
more 

like a regular 
basketball 
team 
where 

they’ve missed 
some 
shots 

than 
what 

they looked like in the first five 
games.”

Despite the low first-half 

scoring mark, the Wolverines 
did find some initial success 
going through the low post to 
freshman Hallie Thome. The 

6-foot-5 center scored six of 
Michigan’s first eight points.

Thome’s 
inside 
presence, 

combined with stifling defense, 
boosted the Wolverines to a 19-14 
advantage in the first quarter. 
Michigan forced Oral Roberts 
sophomore 
guard 
Kaylan 

Mayberry 
into 
committing 

three turnovers in the opening 

quarter, 
and 

sophomore 
forward Jillian 
Dunston 
and 

freshman 
guard Boogie 
Brozoski were 
diving 
for 

loose balls and 
making plays 
that 
initiated 

fast-break 
opportunities 

on the other end.

Thome was the Wolverines’ 

most 
consistent 
source 
of 

offense Sunday, finishing with 
14 points while shooting 7-for-
11 from the field. The freshman 
also grabbed eight rebounds, 

one behind Dunston’s total, 
which led the team.

Despite 
the 
slow 
start, 

Thompson finished with a 
team-high 16 points and was a 
perfect 5-for-5 from the free-
throw line.

Flaherty 
had 
her 
worst 

shooting game of the season, 
converting just 25 percent of 
her shots from the field. She 
failed to score any of her five 
3-point attempts in a seven-
point performance — her lowest 
scoring output of the season.

The Wolverines now head 

into the most difficult stretch of 
their non-conference schedule, 
with a matchup against a quality 
Pittsburgh squad and a road trip 
to face a fringe-top 25 program 
in Princeton in the next week. 
Shooting 46 percent and making 
only one 3-point shot will not 
be enough to challenge its 
upcoming opponents, and those 
will be the primary problems 
Michigan will have to address 
in the coming week.

“It’s not just about scoring,” 

Barnes Arico said. “Sometimes 
you’ve got to be able to defend, 
and tonight I was really happy 
with the way that we defended. 
We’re talking about how we 
only scored 61 points, but we 
held the other team to 44 points, 
so I think we need to take the 
positives out of that.”

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Junior guard Siera Thompson led Michigan with 16 points against Oral Roberts.

“We’re not just 
shooters. We 
can go to the 
basket as well.”

Late goal boosts Michigan

Calderone scores 
in third period, 
Wolverines win 
shootout, 1-0

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

The referee exited the replay 

box and pointed to center ice. The 
goal was good.

Cheers and applause erupted 

from 
the 

crowd 
at 

Yost 
Ice 

Arena like 
steam out of a boiling teapot.

The excitement had built up 

inside of them for 48 minutes, 
and it began to seem impossible 
that the Michigan hockey team 
would ever light the lamp.

But finally, sophomore forward 

Tony Calderone delivered.

After senior forward Boo 

Nieves drove toward the net, the 
puck hung up for grabs just shy of 
the goal line. With a defender in 
his way, Calderone muscled his 
way into position and got his stick 
on it to equalize the game at one.

“(Nieves) made a nice play 

cutting to the middle,” Calderone 
said. “I was able to hit it in. It 
wasn’t pretty, but hey, it counts.”

Calderone’s gritty goal proved 

to be a momentum swing, as the 
No. 12 Michigan hockey team 
went on to beat Dartmouth in a 
shootout — though the result is 
officially recorded as a tie.

On Friday, the Wolverines 

(7-2-2) sent a message to the Big 
Green, piling on seven goals. The 
Wolverines allowed none on their 
own end, and they were lethal on 

the power play.

But after that trouncing of the 

Big Green (2-5-1), and prior to 
Calderone’s finish, the rematch 
couldn’t have started much worse 
for Michigan.

“We knew it would be a tougher 

game,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “We played a pretty 
good game, but we couldn’t 
capitalize on our chances. We got 
isolated chances and so did they. 
The way the game unwound, we 
were lucky to hang on and get a 
tie.”

Thirty-eight seconds into the 

game, sophomore defenseman 
Zach Werenski went to the 
penalty box for tripping. And 
though the Wolverines’ penalty-
kill unit handled the same 
situation coolly Friday, this time 
it paid the price for the mistake.

Just as the penalty expired, 

Dartmouth forward Jack Barre 
fed forward Carl Hesler in 
front of the net. Before senior 
goaltender Steve Racine could 
react, the puck 
was 
through 

his legs as it 
deflected off of 
Hesler’s skate.

From 
that 

point, 
things 

went from bad 
to worse.

Coming 

off a 33-save 
shutout 
performance 
against the Big Green, Racine 
suffered a lower-body injury 
with six minutes left in the 
first period that sent him to the 
locker room for the remainder 
of the contest — leaving him to 
be replaced by junior netminder 
Zach Nagelvoort.

Despite ending the period on 

a power play and outshooting 
Dartmouth 10-7, Michigan came 
away with nothing to show for 
it — an uncomfortable situation 
after taking a three-goal lead into 
the second period Friday.

Throughout 
the 
game, 

Dartmouth’s 
penalty-kill 
unit 

was a well-oiled machine. After 
allowing Michigan to score four 
goals on the power play in the 
previous matchup, the Big Green 
turned away the Wolverines’ 
man-advantage 
attacks 

repeatedly.

“They did their homework,” 

Berenson said. “We couldn’t get 
our shots (or) passes through. It 
was a different penalty kill than 
we faced last night, so it was one 
of those things where we couldn’t 
make the adjustment.”

Dartmouth’s 
most 
notable 

penalty kill came at the opening 
of 
the 
second 
frame 
after 

defenseman 
Ryan 
Bullock 

was sent to the penalty box 

for 
tripping 

— 
giving 

Michigan 
another shot at 
equalizing.

But 
even 

with a man-
advantage for 
two 
minutes, 

after 
just 

testing 
the 

Big Green on 
the 
power 

play to end the first period, the 
Wolverines failed to light the 
lamp and tie the game.

After faltering on the power 

play, the period remained quiet on 
both sides until 10:19 remained in 
the second period. At that point, 
Michigan’s 
best 
opportunity 

came off the stick of freshman 
forward Cooper Marody.

Marody 
carried 
the 
puck 

from the right circle around 
the net, and an open-net wrap-
around opportunity was his for 
the taking. The freshman sent 
the puck towards the twine, 
but goaltender Devin Buffalo 
lunged with his stick to save 
what appeared to be a certain 
equalizer.

Behind Buffalo’s strong 37-save 

effort, the Big Green entered the 
third period leading by a goal 
with no signs of conceding.

Yet with the combined efforts 

of Nieves and Calderone, the 
Wolverines found a way to 
salvage a goal and send the game 
into overtime.

Michigan 
ended 
the 
first 

overtime period with a 5-3 
shot advantage, but its more 
impressive feat was killing a four-
on-three power play to open the 
extra period.

Neither side could put the 

puck in the back of the net, and 
the Wolverines were forced into a 
shootout — where they captured 
the unofficial victory with a 1-0 
advantage.

During his 14 minutes in net, 

Racine allowed the game’s only 
goal but also notched five saves. 
And when Nagelvoort was forced 
to replace Racine in between the 
pipes, he put forth an impressive 
effort — allowing no goals, saving 
two shots in the shootout and 
tallying 30 saves.

Like 
Calderone’s 
goal, 

Michigan’s entire game wasn’t 
pretty. 
But 
the 
Wolverines 

emerged 
unscathed 
with 
a 

victory and tie this weekend.

And to them, that’s what 

counts.

‘M’ turns in gritty 
effort, salvages tie

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

Down a goal in front of a 

raucous Saturday night crowd, 
the Michigan hockey team’s 
hopes of salvaging a weekend 
series rested on the stick of Boo 
Nieves.

The senior forward careened 

toward the net from the corner, 
and sophomore forward Tony 
Calderone dove after the rebound 
with 
abandon. 
Dartmouth 

goaltender Devin Buffalo made 
37 saves on the night, but this 
puck slid untouched, almost 
serenely, across the line amid the 
tangle of bodies in front.

“It wasn’t pretty,” Calderone 

said. “But hey, it counts.”

Calderone is right. The 2-1 

shootout win, officially a tie, 
wasn’t pretty in a classic sense — 
but it was beautiful in its own way.

The Wolverines (7-2-2) opened 

the 2015 season with the tricky 
task of navigating a soft non-
conference schedule. Hockey, 
more than most other sports, is 
a game that either contestant 
can win on any given night. 
Michigan’s 26th-ranked strength 
of schedule, out of 60 teams, 
makes any misstep more costly.

The first game of the weekend 

was a cakewalk. The Wolverines 
converted 27 percent of their shots 
into goals in a 7-0 drubbing of the 
Big Green. But the best results of 
a season are often earned when 
the bounces are falling the wrong 
way. Saturday, for the first time 
this season, Michigan showed an 
ability to will the puck to the back 
of the net.

The biggest challenge was 

overcoming Dartmouth’s stellar 
goaltending. In his second game 
of the season, Buffalo earned 
what should be a permanent 
starting role. In a small sample 
size of 100 minutes this fall, the 
sophomore has faced 52 shots, 

recording a save percentage of 
.942 and a goals against average 
of 1.92.

That mark would be good 

enough for sixth in the NCAA. 
The Big Green’s other two 
goaltenders rank last and second 
to last, respectively.

Buffalo slammed the door 

shut on several close-range 
attempts 
with 
remarkable 

pad speed behind an inspired 
defensive effort. The result was 
frustration for Michigan’s high-
octane offense.

But instead of settling for 

chances 
around 
the 
fringe 

of the offensive zone, as the 
team has been prone to do in 
underwhelming performances 
this 
year, 
the 
Wolverines 

crashed the net hard. The 
strategy finally paid dividends 
with Calderone’s goal.

In college hockey, an ability 

to 
survive 
tightly 
contested 

games night in and night out is 
necessary to build a sufficient 
resume for the postseason. In this 
sense, grit can be more important 
to winning championships than 
elite defense and goaltending.

In fact, the last 10 teams to 

win the national championship 
ranked, on average, just 12th and 
17th in goals-against and save 
percentage.

Friday’s 
win 
was 
almost 

effortless. On Saturday, pretty 
much everything that could have 
gone wrong did. An early goal 
was scored on a deflection from 
a bad angle, Michigan required 
two goaltenders after senior 
Steve Racine left with a lower-
body injury and Buffalo posted a 
career performance.

It was the kind of game that is 

easy to lose, but Michigan didn’t.

Calderone is right — the 

Wolverines’ play wasn’t pretty. 
But walking away with a tie 
might be the most impressive 
result yet this season.

“The way the 

game unwound, 
we were lucky 
to hang on.”

the clock. Ohio State converted 
three third downs and a fourth 
down on the drive, demoralizing 
the Michigan defense. Three of 
those conversions belonged to 
Elliott.

“I don’t lobby or anything, but (I 

think) he should be in New York. 
He’s one of the best players in 
America. He should be a Heisman 
(finalist),” said Ohio State coach 
Urban Meyer. “I don’t know if he 
should win it, I don’t know the 
other players … He’s one of the best 
players I’ve ever been around.”

The Wolverines simply had 

no answers for Ohio State’s star 
running back, especially carrying 
the emotions of his comments last 
week with him. Meyer said after 
the game that Elliott apologized 
37 or 38 times for his comments 
last week — he lost count — and 
Elliott certainly played like a 
man fighting for his reputation on 
Saturday.

He averaged 7.1 yards per carry 

and said after the game it felt like 
he could do whatever he wanted 

to a Wolverine defense that hasn’t 
been the same since it pitched 
three straight shutouts earlier 
this season.

“To come in here and get a win 

like we did today just means the 
world to this whole team,” Elliott 
said. “We came in here into the 
Big House and we dominated. 
We dominated (on) the offensive 
line, and the run game was very 
effective.

“I think it’s something we 

should do every week, honestly.”

Even when it was Barrett 

running 
the 
ball, 
Michigan 

simply didn’t have an answer for 
the Buckeyes on the ground. Ohio 
State totaled 369 yards rushing 
on Saturday, more than any of the 
Wolverines’ opponents all year.

Barrett scored three rushing 

touchdowns, taking advantage 
of the constant attention Elliott 
demanded to break off big chunks 
of yardage.

Early in the game, Michigan 

appeared capable of hanging with 
the Buckeyes. The Wolverines 
forced a stop on Ohio State’s first 
possession, and appeared to have 
forced a three-and-out on the 
Buckeyes’ second drive as well. 
But on fourth down, freshman 
safety Tyree Kinnel was flagged 
for roughing the punter, allowing 
Ohio State to extend its drive.

The 
Buckeyes 
eventually 

scored on the drive, and they did 
not punt again until there were 
five minutes left in the fourth 
quarter, when the game was well 
in hand.

Michigan’s only touchdown 

came near the end of the first 
half, 
when 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback Jake Rudock hit Jehu 
Chesson for a six-yard score. It 
made the score 14-10, the closest 
the Wolverines would come the 
rest of the game.

Rudock had to exit the game 

early in the fourth quarter after 
injuring his left shoulder, but 
by then, the Buckeyes already 
lead 35-13. Redshirt freshman 
Wilton Speight relieved him, 
quarterbacking the offense as the 
clock ticked down on the loss.

“We got beat,” Harbaugh said. 

“Didn’t play well enough in the 
game to win it, but we’ll regroup, 
come back with the same drive 
and aspirations that we’ve had — 
win the next game.”

On Saturday, in his first 

game against the Buckeyes, he 
was far from center stage. That 
distinction belonged to Elliott, 
and Harbaugh made sure he 
knew it.

“He 
played 
really 
good,” 

Harbaugh said. “He’s a heck of a 
player. (I) congratulated him on a 
good game.”
