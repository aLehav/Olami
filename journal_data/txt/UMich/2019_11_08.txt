In the five years since the 2014 
police shooting death of Ann 
Arbor resident Aura Rosser, 
the city’s law enforcement has 
worked to undertake reform 
and 
increase 
transparency. 
While certain city leaders and 
activists have since left town or 
moved to new positions, work to 
increase accountability for law 
enforcement continues, both in 
Ann Arbor and elsewhere. 
Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 

Christopher Taylor was sworn 
in less than 24 hours after 
Rosser was shot. In response 
to the shooting, he posted on a 
public statement on Facebook, 
saying that, while “appalling 
racial injustice and disparity 
continue to degrade our society 
and must be fought at every 
turn,” he also saw the reaction 
of Officer Reid, the officer 
who shot Rosser, as justified 
because he believed his life was 
in danger. 
In a recent interview with 
The Daily, Mayor Taylor cited 

specific programs that have 
been enhanced in response to 
Rosser’s death. He specifically 
discussed Ann Arbor’s renewed 
emphasis 
on 
training 
and 
implementing 
more 
body 
cameras among police officers. 
The city approved upgrades to 
police in-car and body cameras 
in December 2014.
“The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 
Department takes training very 
seriously and has always taken 
training seriously,” Taylor said. 

The City of Ann Arbor has 
undertaken a variety of reforms 
in the half-decade since an 
officer shot and killed Ann 
Arbor resident Aura Rosser 
in 2014. However, as police 
brutality remains a widespread 
issue nationwide, efforts to 
improve 
transparency 
and 
increase accountability have led 
students and experts to call for 
more to be done.
LSA junior Jasmine Penny 
explained that as a resident 
adviser 
in 
Martha 
Cook 
Residence Hall, she deals with 

police in an official capacity. But 
as a Black female student, she 
avoids unnecessary interactions 
with the police.
“As 
an 
RA, 
just 
about 
anything that goes wrong, you 
call the police,” Penny said. 
“So, you have to have a sense 
of trust in them. But when I’m 
out of the building, I feel a little 
more on guard. It’s not that I’ve 
personally had a bad interaction 
with the Ann Arbor police, but 
just in my history of growing 
up, you don’t fully trust the 
police. You stay more on guard 
and tend to avoid unnecessary 
interactions.” 
Penny 
noted 
that 
both 

nationwide 
and 
at 
the 
University, law enforcement has 
been the subject of complaints 
about over-policing.
“I think it would take a 
very long time to bridge the 
gap, because of the distrust in 
general,” Penny said. “Especially 
if we live in a lower-income 
community, we might not trust 
the police to come out and help, 
but that’s also on the police to 
up their standards on how they 
handle things.” 
Training 
in 
police 
de-escalation 
tactics 
is 
a 
reform measure supported by 
members of the law enforcement 

Over the past five years, 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 
Department 
has 
worked 
to 
implement 
reforms 
to 
increase transparency, largely 
in response to the shooting 
death of Ann Arbor resident 
Aura Rosser. However, several 
instances have incited criticism 
from 
residents 
and 
local 
activists who say communities 
of color feel as if they are 
disproportionately targeted by 
AAPD.
Blake Transit Center
In the fall of 2017, an Ann 
Arbor 
police 
officer 
took 
16-year-old 
Ciaeem 
Slaton 

into custody while he was 
waiting at the Blake Transit 
bus stop. A video taken by one 
of Slaton’s friends shows the 
officer pinning Slaton to the 
ground while pointing a taser 
toward 
him. 
Hundreds 
of 
demonstrators gathered on Oct. 
4, 2017 to protest Slaton’s arrest.
The 
ACLU 
of 
Michigan 
reviewed 
the 
police 
report 
and video of the incident and 
called on the AAPD to review 
its policies on de-escalation and 
use of force.
In response, an AAPD official 
and Ann Arbor’s city attorney 
met with the Washtenaw County 
ACLU Lawyers Committee to 
review the incident and discuss 
the city’s plans to implement 

new policy and training on 
de-escalation. 
In an interview with The 
Daily, 
Slaton’s 
mother 
Tria 
Moore 
said 
the 
incident 
continues to affect her and her 
family. 
“I lost so much. I lost the job I 
had just started … because I was 
so stressed out,” Moore said. 
Moore 
said 
the 
instance 
heavily impacted how she views 
Ann Arbor’s systems of justice.
“I have no trust in the police 
department,” Moore said. “I 
have no faith in the police 
department. If something goes 
wrong, they are going to be the 
last people I call.” 

This article is part of a 
Michigan Daily series reflecting 
on the five years since Ann Arbor 
resident Aura Rosser was fatally 
shot by police officer David Ried 
while responding to a call on Nov. 
10, 2014. 
Rosser, a Black woman afflicted 
by a mental illness, was a 40-year-
old mother of three. On Jan. 30, 
2015, the Washtenaw County 
prosecutor’s 
report 
justified 
Ried’s action as “lawful defense.” 
No charges were brought against 
him. 
When 
Lisa 
Jackson, 

community 
activist 
and 
University of Michigan alum, 
first applied for a seat on 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
newly 
formed 
Independent Community Police 
Oversight 
Commission 
this 
February, she understood what 
tensions the city was seeking to 
fix.
According to Jackson, the 
creation 
of 
the 
Oversight 
Commission — on which she 
now serves as chair — was 
inextricably linked to the death 
of Aura Rosser, a Black woman 
with mental illness who was 
shot and killed by Ann Arbor 
police responding to a 911 call, 
five years ago Saturday. In the 
wake of Rosser’s death and the 

investigation 
that 
followed, 
the 
community 
demanded 
increased police accountability 
and community oversight of 
police authority. 
“I think most people could say 
that perhaps there were many 
segments of the community 
that didn’t trust the police very 
much,” Jackson said. “But after 
that, I think if you didn’t trust 
the police, you probably felt that 
your mistrust was well placed.”
Jackson 
acknowledges 
the incident caught many in 
the 
community 
off 
guard, 
particularly for a city like Ann 
Arbor, where previous to 2014, 
a police-involved shooting had 
not occurred for more than 

30 years. But for Jackson, the 
anomaly of Rosser’s death made 
it all the more poignant.
“I think, because it happened 
that one time, it was hugely 
powerful,” Jackson said. “It 
confirmed what a lot of people 
felt — that the police don’t 
value people of color very 
much, or people with mental 
psychological disorders much, 
or people whom they perceive 
to be less valuable than other 
people. I’m not saying that’s 
true. What I’m saying is that 
there was a perception, and 
then that incident confirmed 
that perception.”
Washtenaw 
County 
Prosecutor Brian Mackie was 

prosecuting attorney on the 
case. In a 12-page memo released 
in 
January 
2015, 
Mackie 
determined the officer who 
killed Rosser had acted in self-
defense and labeled the incident 
as “justifiable homicide.”
In 
the 
months 
following 
Rosser’s 
death, 
a 
concerted 
effort was made by the police 
department and the city to 
reform the policies of local 
authorities. Body cameras were 
made standard for all officers. 
Police instituted new training 
on de-escalation and implicit 
bias. In March of this year, 
11 local volunteers, including 
Jackson, were named to the 
Commission by Ann Arbor City 

Council. About a month later, 
the committee went to work. 
The 
members 
of 
the 
commission see clear areas for 
reform in Ann Arbor.
Jackson, 
who 
previously 
served as Board President of 
Ozone House — a nonprofit that 
supports and gives shelter to 
homeless and high-risk youth in 
the Ann Arbor area — said she 
felt she had a unique perspective 
to bring to the commission. In 
deciding whether to apply to the 
commission, Jackson recalled 
her work at Ozone House.

The Daily reports on how law enforcement in A2 has 
changed since fatal police shooting of resident Aura 


community 
and 
experts. 
According to Ann Arbor Police 
Department Chief Michael Cox, 
AAPD officers receive training 
in de-escalation, as well as 
implicit bias training. A new 
addition to training, however, 
is incorporating an awareness 
of mental health. Cox said 
AAPD and Washtenaw County 
Sheriff’s Department officers 
are working with community 
mental 
health 
departments 
to recognize and de-escalate 
situations with citizens who 
have mental health issues. 
“Not only do we have that 
for that unit, but we have 
access to those people 24 hours 
a day,” Cox said. “So, when 
officers go to a scene and we 
run across people that may be 
challenged with some type of 
mental health issue, that we 
have resources to call to help 
us deal with people.” 
Students, 
activists 
and 
advocacy groups across campus 
and the city have called for 
overarching criminal justice 
reform, citing police brutality 
as a reflection of a biased 
system. Law School professor 
Eve Primus explained the 
issues are interconnected and 
require multiple focuses. 
“Structural 
reform 
in 
the criminal justice system 

involves lots of different actors. 
Obviously, when you have a 
system that’s as complex as the 
criminal justice system is, and 
has as many inherent problems 
as the criminal justice system 
does, any reform — to be 
effective — is going to have 
to address all the different 
branches involved,” Primus 
said. “Police is one component 
of that. I do think police reform 
is important, but it’s once piece 
of a larger puzzle.”
Primus said the community 
plays a large role in any type of 
police reform.
“It absolutely is the case that 
community trust of the police 
will affect the police’s ability 
to do the job that they want to 
accomplish,” Primus said. “If 
the community doesn’t trust 
the police force, that will have 
adverse impacts on the police 
force’s ability to investigate 
and solve crimes.”
Public Policy senior Chris 
Young 
is 
an 
Ann 
Arbor 
native and remembers the 
protests after Rosser’s death. 
He 
emphasized 
community 
engagement as the key to trust-
building and said community 
engagement requires an honest 
effort from all stakeholders. 
“I think it comes down to 
informal 
communication, 
and that’s not something that 
can be required, because if 
you’re a police chief or a city 
councilmember and you go 

to your local police force 
and say, ‘I want you to do X 
number of hours of community 
engagement,’ police are going 
to check-in and check-out,” 
Young said. “It needs to come 
from a genuine willingness 
on both sides to make things 
better for the community in 
terms of attitude.”
Cox, 
who 
was 
officially 
sworn 
in 
in 
September, 
previously worked in Boston 
for over 30 years. In an 
interview 
with 
The 
Daily, 
Cox said a significant part of 
reform is rectifying the idea 
that police are only present 
in emergencies or dangerous 
situations. 
“Getting 
officers 
out 
in 
participating more community 
policing — I didn’t invent it, but 
it’s certainly something that 
Ann Arbor hasn’t done in quite 
a while,” Cox said. “I don’t 
know if we call that a reform, 
but that’s certainly something 
we’re practicing. 
One of the first concrete 
actions taken after Rosser’s 
death in November 2014 was 
equipping 
the 
city 
police 
with body cameras, which 
passed City Council in a 
month 
following 
pressure 
from student and community 
protesters. This September, 
Ann Arbor signed a $373,000 
contract 
for 
new 
police 
body cameras built by Axon 
Enterprise, Inc. because of 
frequent 
malfunctioning 
errors 
of 
the 
existing 
cameras in the past year. 
Cox commented on the 
benefits of body cameras, 
despite 
their 
costliness. 
According to Cox, they 
are a useful tool to review 
emotionally-charged 
situations from a more 
objective perspective.
“Humans’ memories are 
not as reliable as what we 
think all the time,” Cox 
said. “Cameras are just 
tremendous at helping us 
resolve a lot of those kind 
of cases because we have 
evidence that we normally 
wouldn’t have.”
Young said Ann Arbor 
was not insulated from 
the same issues happening 
across the country, adding 
that 
reforms 
must 
go 
beyond equipment.
“Even 
though 
I’m 
a 
policy 
student, 
I 
don’t 
think policy is the way to go 
about those things,” Young 
said. “I remember when 
body cameras first started 

to be used more, and people 
were thinking that this would 
be the end of all of these issues, 
and we can see very clearly, 
half a decade later, that’s not 
the case.”
Cox 
said 
police 
officers 
should adapt new methods 
as the profession develops, 
comparing it to other fields 
such as medicine.
“You know, just in general, 
some of our policies and 
procedures may change in the 
future, but I’m in the middle of 
reviewing all of those that we 
have quite a few,” Cox said. “So 
it’s going to take some time.”
Despite 
the 
efforts 
at 
reform, Penny said she is still 
concerned for the future.
“I’m not optimistic for the 
future, because even though 
there are now the body cams, 
there are still unnecessary 
Black shootings,” Penny said. 
“If that’s still happening in 
2019, where are they going to 
go from here?”
Penny 
emphasized 
that 
increasing 
diversity 
among 
law enforcement does not just 
mean race, but background 
experience 
and 
familiarity 
with the community. 
“If you don’t trust the police, 
you’re not going to want to 
be a cop. So, it can’t just be 
a blanket increase of Black 
officers or people of color, but 
it would have to be an increase 
of trust as well,” Penny said 
“These people need to know 
what the disparages of those 
communities 
are, 
and 
not 
people who are just like, ‘Oh, 
I lived on the outskirts of the 
east side of Detroit, so I’m 
going to be a Detroit cop.’ But 
you don’t really know what’s 
going on in the east side, you 
just know what you hear.” 
Cox said the perception 
of police officers nationally 
impacted 
the 
department’s 
efforts to increase diversity 
among its ranks and attract 
high-quality recruits.
“One of the things I think 
I harken back to — you know, 
good people coming to the 
police department,” Cox said. 
“There’s a lot of good people 
here. Good people, no matter 
what organization they’re in, 
they won’t stand by and let a 
lot of bad things happen. They 
want to make change; they 
want to make changes from 
within.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
The University has no idea I’m pledging, they have no record of it. 
I mean, officially they don’t have my name down. And if I die, now it is 
harder for them to prove that it’s because of a hazing incident.”

Student 1, a freshman pledging an IFC fraternity against University of Michigan regulations who wished to remain anonymous 
for fear of social retaliation

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look at 
one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA freshman Nicholas Stoll, 
reported on Michigan volleyball player Paige Jones and how she 
became a key asset for the team.

“I first got the idea about writing about Paige when I was covering volleyball 

and just watching the team. I’m impressed by a lot of the players but you can 

tell, Paige ends almost every game, top of the team, most kills, and she’s just 

— and her coach described as this too — special and you can tell even when 

she’s having a bad game, she’s just a force …I didn’t really know what angle I 

was going to take yet other than I wanted to write about her. And so I was doing 

some research, looked at the bio on MGoBlue, and figured out she was where 

she was from, her high school, and I reached out to her high school coach, and 

that’s kind of where the story really started. I’m really fortunate for that. Diana 

Kramer got back to me really quick and we set up a phone call, and just the 

amazing things she told me about who Paige was as a person and what she 

meant to that town of New Bremen was great because it automatically gave me 

idea and it made me understand who Paige really was and kind of just direct the 

rest of that. And so then after that, I went and talked to Paige and coach Mark 

Rosen from Michigan, and I got a lot of the same amazing stuff and even more 

just about who she is and what fascinated me in that was how great she looks 

to to spectators.”

Multicultural Fraternities
Multicultural 
fraternities 
at the University of Michigan 
have also reported incidents of 
over-policing at their tailgates 
and parties. Before the 2017 
Michigan v. Michigan State 
game, Lambda Theta Phi, a 
Latin fraternity, and Kappa 
Alpha Psi, a historically Black 
fraternity, 
were 
issued 
six 
minor citations. The citations 
were 
for 
disturbing 
public 
peace, creating a nuisance, 
obstructing 
police 
and 
contributing to noise. 
That night, the police also 
forcibly entered the Lambda 
Theta Phi house after citing 
the host with disturbance of 
the public peace. At the time, 
The Daily reported that the 
police report stated they had 
noticed a group of about eight 
people surrounding a Latino 
male and dragging him into 
the house. Officers then forced 
their way into the house. 
The Daily reported that all 
10 predominantly white IFC 
fraternities surveyed reported 
no police presence or citations 
at their house tailgates that day.
Two years after reporting 
these incidents, members of 
multicultural 
fraternities 
say they are still facing over-
policing. Music, Theatre & 
Dance junior Jack Williams 
III said in his one semester as 
a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, 
he noticed the fraternity taking 
extra precautions when hosting 
parties.
According 
to 
Williams, 
hosts 
of 
Alpha 
Phi 
Alpha 
parties typically take several 
preventative measures to avoid 
contact with the police by 
reaching out to their neighbors 
and letting them know that 
there will be an event.
“Establishing 
that 
relationship 
with 
your 
neighbors really goes a long 
way 
because 
unfortunately, 
the reality of the situation is, 
you see a bunch of Black people 
partying … they’re going to call 
the cops, right?” Williams said. 
“So, you just have to establish 
an extra credit.” 
Williams 
said 
he 
gets 
frustrated, 
especially 
with 
the 
knowledge 
that 
other 
predominantly 
white 
fraternities do not have to deal 
with these additional hurdles.
“(This) would never happen 
at a white frat house,” Williams 

said. 
“Because 
we’ve 
had 
parties at a white frat house 
before. We typically have done 
parties with Alpha Delta Phi 
at their house. Never had a 
problem.”
As a student at the University, 
Williams said he felt anxious 
with Ann Arbor’s large police 
presence. 
“The cops are just heavy 
all the time,” Williams said. 
“Every time I’m driving past, 
like, even if I’m not doing 
anything wrong, I’m like … ‘are 
both hands on the wheel? Did I 
stop at that stop light?’ And so, 
just having that added layer of 
pressure all the time … I hope 
I don’t get pulled over and get 
arrested.”
Blind Pig Incident
In the summer of 2018, 
the 
AAPD 
once 
again 
faced 
allegations 
of 
racial 
discrimination 
after 
AAPD 
was 
dispatched 
to 
resolve 
an altercation at The Blind 
Pig bar. Ann Arbor resident 
David 
Bigham 
released 
a 
video on June 24, showing the 
confrontation between officers 
and three unidentified Black 
men outside the bar.
On July 3, the AAPD released 
its own dash cam video of the 
incident. The footage shows 
the incident began when a 
white man motioning the cop 
car toward a group of three 
Black men. Upon exiting the 
car, one of the cops pulled a 
gun on one of the three men 
while yelling profanities at 
him and demanding he to get 
down. Then, the man who had 
originally gestured the cops 
over walked toward the Black 
man on the floor and is seen 
choking him and then shoving 
him toward the pavement. 
In a July 2018 statement, 
then-Interim 
Police 
Chief 
Robert 
Pfannes 
said 
the 
video Bigham released was 
misleading and did not reveal 
the full scenario.
“The white male fighting in 
the video is not an Ann Arbor 
police officer nor a police officer 
anywhere,” Pfannes said. “He 
was also handcuffed when a 
backup officer arrived, but that 
is not seen in the narrow focus 
of the private video.”
The AAPD also launched an 
internal investigation to review 
the incident. During the City 
Council meeting on July 2, City 
Administrator Howard Lazarus 
said the investigation would be 
diligent and in-depth. 
“What I’ve asked the chief 
to do is to proceed fairly, 

equitably, but as quickly as 
he can,” Lazarus said at the 
meeting.
In 
a 
previous 
interview 
with The Daily, Bigham noted 
his video doesn’t tell the full 
story as the dash cam does, but 
that it still revealed the racial 
profiling by the AAPD.
In a recent interview with 
The Daily, Bigham stated he 
was never contacted by AAPD 
to serve as a witness either 
by phone or email. However, 
he did have a conversation 
with Pfannes on June 28, 2018 
during a community outreach 
meeting and said he found 
the police chief’s comments 
disturbing. 
“My general takeaway (was) 
that 
it’s 
about 
protecting 
downtown. That’s what it says 
to me. It says that policing in 
Ann Arbor is about protecting 
downtown,” Bigham said. “Part 
of 
protecting 
downtown 
is 
making not only people of color, 
but especially people of color 
and people who are unsavory, 
as uncomfortable as possible 
when they are downtown in 
order to maximize, sort of, the 
psychological, you know, the 
effects of feeling unwelcome.”
Looking Forward
AAPD 
has 
worked 
to 
improve its relationship with 
the community, according to 
the department’s new chief 
Michael Cox. Cox has said he 
plans to prioritize community 
policing. 
In 
an 
interview 
with The Daily, Cox noted 
cultivating greater trust in the 
community is one way to build 
stronger 
relationships 
with 
Ann Arbor residents. 
“If you want to have a good 
relationship 
with 
anyone, 
you have to have some kind 
of trust and you have to 
build 
that 
usually 
through 
communication 
and 
talking. 
… That’s something different, 
but interacting with the public 
in ways that don’t have to do 
with normal police work is 
important and builds trust,” 
Cox said. “It helps us, you know, 
figure out what the community 
wants. It helps the officers get 
to know the community, and 
the community gets to know 
the officers.”
Cox emphasized how greater 
communication 
among 
the 
department 
and 
community 
could benefit both sides when 
tensions arise. 

come in contact with police 
disproportionate to other kids,” 
Jackson said. “I know that 
they’re super vulnerable. They 
need help. Well, lots of times, 
that’s not necessarily the sort 
of encounters that they have 
with police right now. So that 
was the driving force for me, 
to think about how those kids 
are treated and how we can do 
better by them.”
The 
committee 
only 
emerged 
several 
years 
after 
Rosser’s 
death, 
and 
was the product of months 
of 
collaboration 
between 
community 
activists 
and 
elected town officials. 
Several 
months 
after 
Rosser’s 
death, 
the 
city’s 
Human Rights Commission 
spent $200,000 to contract 
a 
report 
from 
Hillard 
Heintze, a risk management 
firm 
specializing 
in 
law 
enforcement 
consulting. 
While the report deemed 
AAPD to be a “professional 
organization 
staffed 
with 
committed 
officers,” 
it 
encouraged the city to develop 
a 
practice 
of 
community 
policing, namely by way of 
an 
independent 
oversight 
commission.
“When significant policing 
incidents occur, from the Aura 
Rosser shooting to officer-
involved 
vehicle 
accidents, 
they become discussion points 
in the overall community 
dialogue,” the report read. 
“However, the AAPD’s voice 
— 
regarding 
facts, 
action 
and outcomes — is often 
absent from such discussion, 
because 
the 
department 
does not routinely engage in 
community meetings or other 
forums 
regarding 
policing 
actions.”
By 
surveying 
the 
Ann 
Arbor population, another key 
finding of the Hillard Heintze 
report was the desire for 
transparency in police policies 
and practices, a sentiment that 
existed prior to the Rosser’s 
death.
“Many also seek to have 
a 
stronger 
understanding 
of police practices, internal 
investigations 
and 
their 
outcomes,” the report said. 
“Some community members 
and 
their 
representatives 
said the lack of transparency 
and responsiveness to their 
issues 
generates 
concern 
over whether the police are 
accountable 
to 
the 
public 
and, in turn, how that affects 
police behavior.”
In the months and years 
following 
Rosser’s 
death, 
Ann Arborites pushed for 
the creation of an oversight 
commission 
staffed 
by 
members of the community.
One community member 
named 
Dwight 
Wilson, 
who serves as chair of the 
Human Rights Commission 
Subcommittee 
on 
Police 
Oversight, volunteered more 
than 2,000 hours studying 
police oversight boards. He 
used his own funds to travel 
to California, New York and 
Washington, D.C. to speak 
with 
local 
officials 
and 
oversight commissioners in 
other cities. Later, Wilson 
served on the task force 
formed by the city to evaluate 
the possibility of forming a 
police oversight commission 
for Ann Arbor. 
In a speech to City Council 
in October 2018, Wilson was 
vocal about the need to move 

forward with an oversight 
commission, posing it as “the 
last shot we’re going to get for 
the next 20 or 30 years to do 
things right.” 
To a mixture of laughter 
and applause from those in 
attendance, Wilson summed 
up his message to city officials:
“The 
last 
thing 
that 
I 
want to really see is double-
watered-down Kool-Aid being 
passed off as being Scotch,” he 
said.
In a written statement to 
The Daily, Wilson said while 
blame cannot be assigned 
fully on either side, the new 
commission ensures police-
related 
deaths 
or 
other 
incidents will be investigated 
fully and fairly.
“It may be true that no one 
should be happier than the 
majority of the police force 
who genuinely try to do what 
is honorable,” Wilson wrote. 
“I have no idea how many 
officers cross the line, but 
relatives and friends who are 
law enforcement officers are 
clear that they know of no 
force, including their own, 
where 100% of the officers 
walk the straight line. Their 
reputations 
are 
protected 
when the disreputable are 
held accountable. As for the 
victims of killings, brutality 
and 
disrespect, 
police 
oversight is our best hope.”
Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 
said 
the process of building the 
oversight commission was one 
of cooperation between city 
government 
and 
residents. 
Not only were community 
members 
like 
Wilson 
instrumental in pushing for 
the commission’s formation, 
but elected officials likewise 
pushed for new police training 
and reforms.
“I would characterize us 
as working together on this,” 
Taylor said. “After the death 
of Ms. Rosser, which everyone 
internally 
and 
externally 
views as a tragedy, we in 
City Hall and the community 
wanted to make sure that our 
officers had the training they 
need. They were well-trained 
before, we wanted to make 
sure that these areas were 
again emphasized, because 
these are issues of growing 
importance 
and 
growing 
vulnerability.”
As for the reasons behind 
the push for augmented police 
training 
and 
department 
transparency, Taylor said he 
had no doubt as to what set 
those events in motion.
“The conversation around 
policing, the Human Rights 
Commission 
request 
for 
an 
external 
review, 
the 
receipt of that review, the 
recommendations 
of 
that 
review, I think those were 
absolutely 
conducted 
in 

response to the death of Ms. 
Rosser,” Taylor said.
And 
now 
that 
the 
commission is up and running, 
Taylor said a more effective 
conduit for communication 
has been created between 
police 
and 
the 
larger 
community. 
“What the Police Oversight 
Commission has been doing 
for the past couple of months 
is learning,” Taylor said. “You 
have civilians whose job it is to 
serve as an interface between 
the community and the police 
department, to oversee the 
police department by way 
of introducing a community 
voice into the policies and 
practices 
of 
the 
police 
department, 
understanding 

what the police do and why 
they do it, communicating 
that to the community and 
understanding the impact and 
consequences and perception 
of those policies and practices 
and communicating that back 
to the police.”
But since its formation, 
Jackson said, the commission 
has done much more. On 
a given day, Jackson and 
her 
fellow 
commissioners 
may meet with police or 
community members or share 
ideas 
with 
commissioners 
from 
similar 
oversight 
boards across the country. 
Jackson 
herself 
has 
even 
reached out to several student 
groups 
at 
the 
University, 
including the Black Student 
Psychological 
Association, 
of which Jackson is a former 
member, to determine how 
interactions between students 
and police can be aided by the 
commission.
One group supportive of 
the push towards transparent 
policing 
is 
the 
Student 
Community 
of 
Progressive 
Empowerment, 
a 
student 
organization advocating for 
the rights of undocumented 
students 
and 
community 
members. LSA senior Barbara 
Diaz and LSA junior Sandra 
Perez 
are 
both 
members 
of SCOPE and look at the 
oversight commissions that 
have been created in Ann 
Arbor and elsewhere as a 
means for improvements to 
be made in the relationship 
between 
undocumented 
people and local police.
“I think there’s always 
going to be that underlying 
anxiety,” 
Perez 
said. 
“Whenever 
you 
see, 
you 
know, someone in a uniform 
— because it is what they 
do, or what they’re required 
to do is abide by the laws of 
the government, the laws 
of local law enforcement, 
there’s always going to be 
that 
concern 
among 
the 
undocumented community.”
But Diaz said in many cases, 
resolving the issue of mistrust 
between 
undocumented 
communities and local police 
requires 
resolving 
more 
foundational 
issues 
than 
police reform. 
“When you’re talking about 
immigrant 
communities, 
undocumented communities 
and 
feeling 
safe 
with 
trusting public government 
institutions such as the police, 
I think it really does come 
down to immigration reform 
as a whole,” Diaz said. “Just 
because, at the end of the day 
you are still undocumented. 
From growing up, you’re not 
inclined to even go to the 
hospital, let alone go seek help 
from the police, just because 
you are already hyper-aware 
that something could happen 
to you if they ask too many 
questions.”
And as the head of the 
newly 
formed 
oversight 
commission, the need to build 
a sense of trust between law 
enforcement and communities 
of color is something Lisa 
Jackson is acutely aware of. 
“I know police officers, 
and I understand there are 
some 
really 
good 
police 
officers,” Jackson said. “I 
also understand that African 
Americans in this community 
don’t feel like we’re treated 
exactly the same. We don’t 
have that expectation. And 
so I know that there’s a 
place somewhere for us to do 
better.”

“After the death of Ms. Rosser, 
we 
emphasized 
training 
in 
connection with mental illness, 
bias 
and 
de-escalation. 
We 
also at the time did a process 
obtaining body cameras, and 
that process was accelerated. 
We (are) now on the second 
or third generation of body 
cameras, just recently. That’s an 
important part of maintaining 
public confidence.”
In February 2016, James 
Baird was appointed as police 
chief. In 2018, Baird announced 
he would step down from 
his position in Ann Arbor. 
Currently, Baird serves as the 
Chief of the Breckenridge Police 
Department in Breckenridge, 
Colorado.
In an email interview with 
The Daily, Baird noted reforms 
implemented throughout his 
tenure, including body camera 
implementation, de-escalation 
and implicit bias training and a 
national accreditation process. 
He discussed how Rosser’s 

death 
inevitably 
impacted 
the actions he took during 
his tenure, specifically in the 
realm of supporting officers 
while simultaneously building 
community trust. 
“I 
suppose 
it 
would 
be 
inevitable 
that 
an 
incident 
of 
this 
magnitude 
would 
have an effect on how I ran 
the 
department, 
especially 
considering how rarely lethal 
force had been necessary in Ann 
Arbor, primarily balancing the 
competing priorities of building 
trust in the community with 
the need to support the officers 
doing an incredibly difficult 
job under increasingly trying 
circumstances,” Baird wrote.
Taylor also discussed the 
new police chief, Michael Cox. 
Cox held multiple roles in the 
Boston 
Police 
Department 
before his appointment as Chief 
of Ann Arbor Police.
“He has a long and important 
history. He has emphasized his 
desire to expand community 
policing, and make sure that 
officers are engaged with all 
members of the community,” 
Taylor said of Cox.

During his selection process, 
Cox disclosed that, in 1995, 
he had been the victim of an 
assault and subsequent cover-
up by fellow officers. Cox was 
beaten while undercover, after 
officers believed he was a Black 
gang member suspected for a 
fatal shooting. Cox has since 
said he is “very aware of bad 
policing.” 
In an interview with The 
Daily, 
Cox 
discussed 
his 
commitment 
to 
community 
policing, 
and 
specifically 
getting individuals to interact 
with police in order to build 
trust. 
“The goal is really just to get 
the officers out into the public 
so we can build some more 
trust,” Cox said. “We’re going 
out and revitalizing those and 
meeting people and introducing 
the officers to them.”
In response to Rosser’s death 
in 2014, student activists from 
various organizations began to 
take action. Notably, University

How pop culture sees mental illness

Has neoliberalism run its course in Chile?

A

s I settled in to catch up 
on HBO’s award-winning 
series “Barry,” an atypical 
opening announcement took me by 
surprise. In a show about a former hit 
man looking to start anew, pre-show 
warnings on violence are the norm. 
However, this disclaimer stated that 
“the following program contains 
post-traumatic 
stress 
disorder,” 
quickly followed up by “and it’s 
ok.” The next announcement was 
a reminder to call a mental health 
hotline run by both HBO and the 
National Institute of Mental Health 
if the viewer or someone they know 
is in crisis, with an additional website 
address for further information. 
These 
new 
mental 
health-
oriented “bumpers” are a part 
of HBO’s initiative to increase 
awareness 
for 
mental 
illness. 
However, as opposed to issuing 
viewer discretion warnings for 
depictions of mental illness, as 
Netflix did with the controversial 
“13 Reasons Why,” HBO’s alerts 
serve 
another 
purpose. 
They 
highlight the reality that living 
with a mental illness is normal and 
provide a reminder that there is no 
shame in seeking help. Rather than 
advising those who are sensitive 
away from certain scenes because 
of their content, these bumpers 
act as invitations of discussion on 
specific mental illnesses. These 
“viewer conversation encouraged” 
advisories will accompany some of 
HBO’s most popular programs, such 
as “Euphoria,” “Girls,” “Succession” 
and “The Sopranos.” In addition to 
the use of mental health-oriented 
bumpers, 
HBO’s 
partnership 
with NIMH includes a series of 
educational videos with expert 
commentary on myths surrounding 
mental health issues as well as 
discussion on their portrayal in the 
episode. 
This initiative by HBO represents 
the beginning of a larger societal 
change regarding mental illness. 
The media has a profound influence 
on the reinforcement of public 
perception of a certain population 
based 
upon 
their 
common 
portrayal. The American aversion 
to conversations on mental illness 
is often augmented by inaccurate 
portrayals 
in 
popular 
culture. 
However, 
current 
depictions 
in TV programs and movies 
demonstrate drastic progress in the 
understanding of mental health over 
the past century. 
In the 1950s, for example, the 
majority of the U.S. populace 
equated all mental illness with 

psychosis. During this era, issues 
pertaining to mental health were 
often avoided, contributing to such 
inaccurate perceptions. The danger 
and violence often associated with 
mental illness is highlighted by 
Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 horror 
film “Psycho.” In the film, serial 
killer 
Norman 
Bates 
develops 
what is now known as dissociative 
identity disorder and engages in 
a series of violent murders. The 
horror genre’s emphasis on violence 
and mental illness continues with 
John 
Carpenter’s 
famed 
1978 
classic, “Halloween.” The storyline 
of this film involves an escaped 
mental asylum patient, Michael 
Myers, and his deranged killing 
spree of teenagers in his suburban 
hometown. 
Breaking away from horror films, 
mental illness was again in the 
spotlight in the Academy Award-
winning 1975 film “One Flew Over 
the Cuckoo’s Nest.” Based on the 
popular 1962 novel of the same name, 
the film stars Jack Nicholson as 
Randle Patrick McMurphy, a convict 
who feigns mental illness to avoid 
a prison sentence. In many senses, 
“One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” 
was a radical, innovative portrayal 
of mental illness. The oftentimes 
patronizing and inadequate care 
experienced by institutionalized 
patients is at the forefront of the plot. 
The characters involved are treated 
as children by their caregivers 
and have little hope for life after 
release. As opposed to portraying 
them as violent killers, the mental 
health patients here are humans 
condemned to life in a health care 
system that cannot properly care for 
them. 
However, 
the 
movie’s 
most 
memorable scenes involve terrifying 
moments as McMurphy’s character 
undergoes violent electroconvulsive 
shock therapy as a punishment 
for unruly behavior. Eventually, 
the 
once-lively 
McMurphy 
is 
lobotomized and left in a zombie-
like state before being euthanized by 
his roommate. “One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo’s Nest” certainly challenged 
the status quo in terms of typical 
representations of mental illness. 
However, the popularity of the film 
influenced common ideas of mental 
illness for years to come. A 1983 study 
finds that college students viewed 
those with mental illness more 
negatively after viewing the film.
Understandings of mental illness 
began to change at the end of the 20th 
century. In contrast to perceptions in 
the 1950s, Americans in 1996 showed 

a deeper understanding of the non-
psychotic symptoms of mental 
illness. However, these same results 
also found that U.S. society by the 
late 1990s still maintained negative 
attitudes toward those with mental 
illness. Representation of mental 
health in pop culture seemed to turn 
a corner with 2001’s “A Beautiful 
Mind.” The biographical film about 
the life of famed mathematician 
John Nash and his schizophrenia 
diagnosis 
demonstrated 
those 
with mental illnesses as capable 
of achieving remarkable goals. 
“A Beautiful Mind” depicted the 
vivid, haunting hallucinations that 
followed Nash throughout his life 
while also showing his triumphs, 
including 
a 
Nobel 
Prize 
for 
economics and his ability to have a 
family.
The relationship between public 
perception and pop culture portrayal 
of mental illness cannot be ignored. 
All too often, movies and TV shows 
fail to accurately demonstrate the 
reality of mental health problems, 
further stigmatizing an already 
marginalized population. However, 
the 
HBO-NIMH 
initiative 
represents 
changing 
ideals 
on 
popular 
culture’s 
handling 
of 
mental illness. While films such 
as 
“Psycho” 
and 
“Halloween” 
demonized 
those 
with 
mental 
illnesses, 
more 
contemporary 
depictions represent a different path. 
NIMH has praised movies such as 
“Silver Linings Playbook” (2012), 
“The Skeleton Twins” (2014) and 
“The Perks of Being a Wallflower” 
(2012) as examples of humanizing, 
accurate portrayals of mental illness. 
However, negative and harmful 
portrayals of mental illness still 
persist. “13 Reasons Why” received 
criticism for targeting a vulnerable 
teenage audience while highlighting 
a suicide revenge fantasy and 
failing to mention mental health 
or mental illness at all in the first 
season. M. Night Shyamalan’s 2015 
thriller “Split” once again features 
a violent villain with dissociative 
identity disorder, reviving a trope 
seen since “Psycho.” Despite these 
instances, Hollywood seems to be 
reversing the trend of demonizing 
mental illness. More and more films 
released recently have received 
praise for accurate displays of 
mental illness. The HBO-NIMH 
partnership represents a societal 
trend on opening honest dialogue 
surrounding 
mental 
illness,

or the past several weeks, 
Chile has been rocked by 
massive protests, mainly 
in the capital city of Santiago. 
Traditionally, protests of this scale 
are the result of major political, 
social or economic decisions made 
by a government that citizens feel 
would dramatically impact their 
lives. However, in Chile’s case, the 
uprising was caused by a seemingly 
innocuous change: the city of 
Santiago’s decision to raise the price 
of metro tickets by 30 pesos, or about 
four cents. While this may seem like 
a strange catalyst for nationwide 
protests, the increased metro fare 
cannot be viewed in isolation. For 
many Chileans, this is representative 
of systemic problems with their 
nation’s society and government 
which have gone on for far too long. 
Since the mid-1970s, Chile’s 
socioeconomic identity has centered 
on neoliberalism, and this free-
market ideology helped spur a 
period of growth which economist 
Milton 
Friedman 
once 
called 
the “Chilean Miracle.” However, 
while some raw data may point to 
Chile’s neoliberal period as a time 
of success, this is misleading. In 
reality, Chile’s economic growth 
has almost exclusively benefited 
the social and political elites, and 
the country’s neoliberal policies 
have left most citizens struggling 
mightily. Ultimately, what Chile and 
Chilean citizens need is not a return 
to lower metro fares or a reshuffled 
government, but rather a systematic 
shift away from the neoliberal 
economic policies that have propped 
up economic growth for decades, 
but have simultaneously failed to 
provide for the vast majority of the 
Chilean people. 
To begin, it is important to 
critically evaluate the Chilean 
economy’s 
impressive 
statistical 
growth of the past 40 years, since 
on a purely numeric level, some 
of the numbers are undeniably 
strong. In 1980, Chile’s GDP per 
capita sat at $2,577.32 per person, 
essentially level with the world 
average of $2,530. However, by 
2013 Chile’s GDP per capita had 
risen to $15,941.40 per person, 

substantially higher than the global 
average of $10,764 per person. In 
South America specifically, Chile’s 
economic trajectory has followed 
a similar path. Around 1980, the 
nation’s wealth was in line with 
the regional average, but by 2013, it 
was one of the wealthiest nations in 
South America. 
However, these statistics don’t tell 
the whole story of Chile’s economic 
development under neoliberalism. 
First, overall economic growth 
has been stagnating in Chile in 
recent years. Since the nation first 
introduced its neoliberal economic 
policies in the 1970s, annual GDP 
increases of over 5 percent have been 
common. However, in recent years 
this growth has tailed off, and since 
2014, Chile’s GDP annual growth 
rate has never surpassed 2.5 percent 
(the five year period from 2014 to 
today is the only period in which this 
has happened). More importantly 
than the country’s overall economic 
standing, Chile’s neoliberal policies 
have created massive inequality 
within the country, which is at 
the heart of many protesters’ 
discontent. Today, Chile is the most 
economically 
unequal 
member 
of the 36-country Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, with a greater wealth 
disparity than countries such as 
Mexico, Turkey and Hungary. 
Additionally, while the country’s 
overall poverty rate has declined, 
much of the urban population is still 
impoverished.
Unsurprisingly, 
Chile’s 
focus 
on privatization and market-based 
policies has created a societal 
structure 
which 
worsens 
the 
difficulties 
already 
inherently 
associated with working-class life. 
The most prominent inequality 
in Chile’s current political system 
is the nation’s tax plan, which has 
two major problems: It both fails to 
raise sufficient revenue for federal 
projects and is highly inequitable, 
frequently foisting a great deal of the 
nation’s costs onto the lower class. 
First, Chile has by far the lowest 
tax revenue of any OECD nation, 
which prevents the government 
from effectively providing public 

services to the people, a problem 
which is particularly pertinent for 
lower and middle-class Chileans. 
Intertwined with this is Chile’s 
second problem, which is the 
nation’s extremely unprogressive 
tax system. Today, Chile only has 
three income brackets taxed at 
above 20 percent (for comparison, 
under President Trump’s tax cut, 
the United States has five). The 
nature of Chile’s neoliberal tax 
system means the nation misses out 
on a chance to actually raise revenue 
from society’s wealthiest members, 
leading to limited government 
spending 
or 
disproportionate 
taxation of the working class, either 
through increased income taxes or 
an excessive reliance on regressive 
policies such as sales tax. 
Taking all this into account, it’s 
easy to see why protesters across 
Chile have taken to the street. 
Their nation’s economic model has 
promoted growth overall, but has 
left the vast majority of the citizenry 
behind. This is not a protest over 
a particular leader or corrupt 
government official, but rather over 
an entrenched economic system that 
requires substantial overhauling. 
So far, Chilean leadership seems 
unwilling to acquiesce to the 
protesters demands, with President 
Sebastían Piñera removing some 
hardline government officials, but 
not making any drastic changes. 
Furthermore, the government has 
cracked down on protests with 
violence, something that has a very 
ugly history in Chile. Unfortunately 
for Piñera and the government, 
the endemic problems behind the 
citizens discontent are omnipresent 
and are unlikely to simply fade 
away. In order to truly counter 
these problems, Chile must finally 
drop its focus on neoliberalism and 
make a systematic shift toward 
raising taxes, nationalizing certain 
goods and services, and focusing 
on providing for its working-class 
citizens — then, and only then, will 
the problems behind this movement 
be abated.

W

ith so many new 
companies 
offering 
organic 
cotton 
menstrual products, my housemates 
and I got to talking one night and 
wondered why so many people were 
making the switch. There are the 
obvious reasons: There’s less waste 
with silicone cups, and the smaller 
companies are run by knowledgeable 
women versus huge corporations. 
There’s also the glaring concept that, 
compared to non-organic items, 
organic products are simply better 
for you due to the lack of chemicals. 
My friends and I began to look up 
the ingredients of commercial and 
conventional tampons and realized 
we actually knew nothing of what 
goes into them. 
Like many things, the Food 
and Drug Administration doesn’t 
thoroughly require toxicity testing 
for menstrual products or that all 
ingredients and the manufacturing 
process be made transparent to 
consumers. They do recommend that 
tampons should be free of pesticide 
residue, but many still contain trace 
amounts due to the manufacturing 
procedure. 
Furthermore, 
the 
cotton that constitutes non-organic 
tampons is commercially produced, 
meaning it goes through rigorous 
bleaching and chemical cleaning 
that exposes the cotton fibers to 
toxins. More insecticides are used to 
grow conventional cotton than any 
other commercial crop.
First, let’s consider the area of the 
body that tampons regularly come 
into contact with. As many of us 
know, tampons are inserted directly 
into the body to absorb blood and stop 
external leakage. The tampon then 
resides in the upper two-thirds of the 
vaginal canal, an area rich in blood 
vessels and mucous membranes. 
Additionally, the vaginal epithelium 
is covered in multiple layers of dead 
and dying cells, and the vaginal 
mucous membrane helps to protect 
against harmful microorganisms 
and bacteria. However, this tissue 
is nowhere near as thick as our 
external skin, and this tissue is 
efficient 
at 
carrying 
chemical 
messengers and other materials 
throughout the body. 
A report from Women’s Voice for 
the Earth, a nonprofit organization, 
states 
that 
within 
menstrual 
products, there are ingredients used 
that are known or suspected to be 
endocrine-disrupting 
chemicals, 

or EDCs. The endocrine system is 
a complex physiological network 
of glands and organs that work to 
produce and secrete hormones. 
When 
the 
endocrine 
system 
functions 
normally, 
it 
works 
brilliantly 
to 
regulate 
healthy 
development and body function. 
However, when exposed to EDCs 
— which can be substances in the 
environment, food, personal care 
and/or 
manufactured 
products 
— this system is disrupted. Some 
EDCs can act as “mimic hormones” 
and trick our bodies while others 
can stop natural hormones from 
doing their job. They can increase 
or decrease natural hormone levels, 
change how sensitive our bodies 
are to hormones and have the 
ability to ultimately cause various 
injurious health outcomes. These 
deviations of healthy processes can 
include abnormalities in sex organs, 
endometriosis, 
early 
puberty, 
changed nervous system or immune 
function, 
including 
respiratory, 
metabolic, cardiovascular issues and 
more. 
The breakthrough concerning 
EDCs came following a time when 
female researchers realized there 
was really no scientific research 
into the development or effects of 
conventional tampon usage. Vaginal 
research desperately needed more 
attention, and women such as Penny 
Hitchcock and Nancy Alexander 
took this opportunity to begin 
research 
programs 
on 
vaginal 
physiology, 
microbicides 
and 
immunology. These new programs 
founded by women led to the 
knowledge that certain chemicals, 
many of which were conventionally 
used in or around reproductive 
organs, could irritate or even damage 
vaginal epithelial cells. While nearly 
everyone who menstruates uses 
some type of tampon or sanitary 
pad, the chemicals in those create 
a perfect environment for altering 
normal vaginal physiology. In a 
study conducted in 2000 to provide 
numbers for how many people use 
which menstrual hygiene product, 
a range of 50 to 86 percent use 
tampons, 75 percent use panty 
liners, 62 to 73 percent use pads 
and so on. With a rough majority 
of users opting for the tampon 
route, 
many 
people 
choosing 
conventional tampons are directly 
and unknowingly subjecting their 
body to microdoses of chemicals and 

parabens. 
Groundbreaking 
menstrual 
health research, which has only 
started in the past few decades, 
creates 
greater 
awareness 
surrounding chemicals in hygiene 
products, but there’s still a large data 
and funding gap. This means people 
who menstruate really don’t know 
what is going into their bodies and 
how those products are affecting 
their health. 
This brings us to the upside of 
organic cotton tampons. To be 
labeled organic, any product must go 
through considerably stricter FDA 
guidelines than their nonorganic 
counterparts. For this reason, we 
know exactly what we are getting, 
and that is often pesticide-free, 
rayon-free, 
synthetic 
fiber-free, 
all-organic, cotton tampons. The 
wonderful women who started the 
organic tampon movement industry, 
pioneering companies like LOLA 
and Cora, ensure their consumers 
that their companies do not contain 
synthetic fibers, chemical additives, 
fragrances, dyes, chlorine bleach, 
GMOs, pesticides, toxins, latex 
or formaldehyde. We can assume 
that if a company specifically states 
those ingredients are not involved in 
their products, it would be logical to 
believe those bad ingredients go into 
the widely purchased, conventional 
tampons — But we don’t really know, 
do we?
Of course, the FDA does regulate 
tampons 
as 
medical 
devices 
and provides many guidelines 
companies should follow. However, 
this doesn’t mean the micro-
amounts of chemicals still allowed 
in 
non-organic, 
conventional 
menstrual products are necessarily 
safe for you or ideal to put in your 
body. For the same reason many 
people made the switch to organic 
foods to avoid consuming trace 
amounts of pesticides, fertilizers or 
carcinogens, many are now making 
the switch to organic tampons 
to avoid those same things. For 
some, including myself and my 
housemates, organic tampons have 
anecdotally reduced menstruation 
time or lessened period cramps. 
These results could be due to a 
variety of reasons, but it gives us 
peace of mind to know what we are 
putting in our bodies.

Friday, November 8, 2019 — 5A

It was the second distinct time I was lobbied to watch “BoJack 
Horseman.” This was a few days before I, more willingly, saw Bong 
Joon-ho’s (“Snowpiercer”) “Parasite.” I had given “BoJack” a chance 
once before, at another trusted friend’s lobbying, only to be turned off 
by how on-the-nose the show seemed to be. At the time, I preferred my 
social commentary to take more allegorical, thought-provoking forms, 
perhaps in the spirit of Rod Serling’s “The Twilight Zone” — a favorite 
from my adolescence. 
Even though I pretended to work on homework while he queued 
the third episode of the sixth and final season of “BoJack,” it wasn’t 
long before I got sucked in. One scene 
in particular struck me, when one of 
the characters, Diane (Alison Brie, 
“GLOW”), interviewed the CEO of an 
increasingly 
powerful 
conglomerate, 
and he told her on the record that he 
murdered one of his employees. Diane 
and I responded with equal shock at first, 
only for the CEO to clarify that the U.S. 
House of Representatives just approved 
a bill legalizing murder for billionaires. 
She and I both gradually resigned, too, to 
the CEO’s explanations of how this could 
be possible. “Really, Diane?” he asked, 
each time she offered another check or 
balance that might oppose the passing 
of this seemingly absurd, but also 
depressingly not-so-absurd measure. By 
the final “Really?” I wondered: Is that 
really so far-fetched, in this country? 
Afterward, I asked my friend to 
explain what he liked about the show, 
offering my initial ambivalence in 
response to its directness. He said that 
that was actually the part of the show 
he appreciated most — its willingness to 
spell out the things we’re too scared to 
admit could happen or are happening in 
the world — which I now realize is what 
this standout scene delivered.
A week later, as I tried to process 
Bong’s latest feature, I kept revisiting that scene and conversation 
about the appeal of a show like “BoJack Horseman.” “Parasite” makes 
a similar appeal in the way it juggles reality and realism. And so do a 
number of films from recent years — to the extent that they seem to 
constitute a new wave of contemporary cinema. This wave — consisting 
of films like Bong’s, as well as the work of directors like Hirokazu Kore-
eda and Boots Riley — is tidal. It disorients us, destabilizes the forces 
(often insidious) that give structure to our lives, prevents us from taking 
the air we breath for granted. And it’s what we need to reckon with the 
extremes of capitalism in this day and age.

***

“Parasite” starts with a scenario for which the title prepares us. The 
four members of the Kim family — the father and mother, Ki-taek (Song 
Kang-ho, “A Taxi Driver”) and Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), and their 
young adult children, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik, “Train to Busan”) and 
Ki-jeong (Park So-dam, “Ode to the Goose”) — are living in poverty 
and struggling to find work. At his friend’s suggestion, Ki-woo finds 
employment by forging a college degree and assuming a position as 
a private tutor for the wealthy Park family’s young daughter Da-hye 
(Jung Ziso, “Daughter”). The rest of the Kims then conspire to get 
employed by the Park family — either getting the Parks’ servants fired, 
or convincing the Parks they need additional staff, like an art therapist 
for their son — and do so successfully for some time. 
But to say “Parasite” is about a poor family’s infiltration of a rich 

family’s domestic labor force is like saying, for instance, Boots Riley’s 
“Sorry to Bother You” is about telemarketing. Both of these capitalist 
critiques resist the chokehold of synopsis, and are better described 
in terms of the range of social issues they fearlessly depict and 
deconstruct. In Riley’s film, this ranges from union organizing to racial 
discrimination, from violence in the media to corporate violations 
against human rights. Bong juggles a range of issues as well — the 
widening gap between rich and poor, class consciousness (or the lack 
thereof), environmental catastrophe — but all through the lens of class 
relations. And as these lists may imply, a characteristic of this new wave 
of films is intersectionality: awareness of how the seemingly incidental 
are interrelated, of how forms of marginalization converge, by no 
accident, on the same targets.

While that may sound like a recipe for allegory (how better to 
balance many competing conflicts than to metaphorize, to branch 
out to both figurative and literal terrain?), directors like Bong resist 
clearly signaling what we’re supposed to take as realism versus what 
is metaphorical. On the one hand, that makes for a troubling viewer 
experience. One sequence in particular comes to mind: when the Kim 
family thinks they have the Park mansion all to themselves while the 
Parks are out of town. While they luxuriate in the Parks’ food and 

drink, Chung-sook makes a dark joke, that in spite of the power they 
feel themselves to possess in that moment, the four of them would 
scatter like cockroaches if they were caught. It’s hard to know what to 
make of the next scene, then, that disturbingly fulfills her prediction, as 
the Parks come back home unexpectedly and the Kims crawl under and 
out from tables in order to escape unnoticed. 

But maybe we shouldn’t know what to do with these complexities 
that Bong juggles, especially the absurdity of living in the extremes 
of capitalism. “It’s so metaphorical!” Ki-woo memorably exclaims 
on three separate occasions in the film. It’s hard not to read that as a 
direct challenge from Bong: Don’t we want to relegate these things to 
metaphor, when perhaps that’s a coping mechanism? When perhaps 
we’d do well to accept that we’ve created the conditions for what would 
seem impossible to be all too possible?
As the cockroach sequence probably suggests, dark humor is 
the prevalent mood in Bong’s work. “Sorry to Bother You” has a 
similar register (as does “BoJack Horseman”). Instead of feeling 
inappropriate or tone deaf, it’s often refreshing. The realities these 
creatives are confronting are tough to swallow, and they recognize 
that. Instead of softening the blow, 
they let their audience struggle with 
them, choke on them. That is not to 
say, however, that these films preclude 
emotional sensitivity altogether; rather, 
these directors wield emotion more 
carefully (and perhaps, in turn, less 
manipulatively). Select scenes from 
“Parasite” point to these more selective, 
but 
subsequently 
more 
impactful, 
emotional displays. I’m thinking of the 
withering look on Ki-taek’s face every 
time he overhears Mr. Park expressing 
revulsion to the scent of poor people or 
recognized the scent on himself. But the 
prime example here may be the work of 
another filmmaker: Hirokazu Kore-eda, 
the director of 2018’s “Shoplifters.” The 
extraordinary aspect of this film is not 
how little the forces of capitalism and 
the widening wealth gap has left the 
non-biological family at the center of this 
film, or the life of shoplifting they must 
sustain in order to sustain themselves. 
Rather, it is the love and care they show 
one another, if not show one another 
more frequently and authentically, with 
the forced realization that all other 
forces of society have left them behind.

***

At the outset of the 2010s, The Guardian published an article titled 
“Hollywood searches for escapism after the apocalypse.” It tried to 
make sense of the onslaught of post-apocalyptic films the U.S. was 
putting out at the time by linking it to wide-scale social change, and 
people’s anxiety over that. I first encountered this narrative theory at 
the same time I first encountered Bong’s work. It was in an ecocriticism 
unit of a course on literary theory, and we watched the beginning of 
2013’s “Snowpiercer,” which takes place on a train that hosts the 
survivors of a climate disaster that brought on another ice age. 
Critics are describing “Parasite” as another dystopian feature, but 
I would hesitate to call “Parasite” or its contemporaries “dystopian.” 
That term assumes a remote future, when I don’t think Bong, Riley 
or Kore-eda want us to take comfort in the same cushion between 
us and the people we see on screen. These films are doing something 
different from the apocalyptic films from a decade ago — something 
more productive, authentic and useful. They aren’t distracting us with 
the impossible or improbable; they’re showing us what we’ve made 
possible, are making possible, in an honest, if disturbing, light.
It took me a little while to admit that about these films. It’s not easy 
to see the world for what we’ve made it. But eventually I’d ask myself, 
Really? in a tone not unlike the one I’d heard on Season 6, Episode 3 of 
“BoJack Horseman.” Are these impossible, or do I want them to be? I 
needed these directors to push me to ask that question and to realize 
it’s probably the latter. I think a lot of us need to see more clearly where 
we’re headed before we think about the future.

‘Parasite’ joins the powerful wave of capitalist critiques

FILM REVIEW

TV REVIEW

At this point the “Queer Eye” formula, while still 
charming, is extremely well-trodden and slightly 
less engaging than when the 2018 reboot of the series 
“Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” first appeared on 
Netflix. You get the impression that the parts of the 
show that cry out for some more substance (looking 
at you, Karamo and Antoni) than the ones focusing 
on style have anything but 
real substance, relying on 
little more than superficial 
platitudes and advice that 
is meant to be simple but 
is 
ultimately 
bafflingly 
useless. The fear of that 
goes into overdrive when 
the “Fab Five” venture out 
to Japan and try to apply 
their “methods” to a vastly 
different culture.
Nonetheless (thankfully), to their credit, cultural 
sensitivity was pretty high. The subject of the first 
episode of this mini-series is an older nurse named 
Yoko who works in hospice care and who society 
views as having “given up on being a woman” 
due to her lack of extensive grooming. As usual, 
the interactions between her and the Fab Five do 
take some time to develop chemistry. But they do 
eventually, and while it’s something we’ve seen a 
million times before, it’s heartwarming nonetheless.
The Fab Five are joined intermittently by 
American-Japanese model Kiko Mizuhara, a 
valuable addition who adds a good amount of 

cultural context and fits in well with the crew. For 
the most part, the Fab Five are incredibly respectful 
with the people they encounter and make sure to 
clear up some of the finer points of, for example, 
how to address someone in Japanese. In addition, 
the featured locales are diverse and provide a breath 
of fresh air from many of the locations presented in 
the United States.
Yet the producers did miss several opportunities 
for novelty. For starters, I could’ve done without 
wanting to gag every time one of the Fab Five 
sputtered out a “kawaii” 
from 
their 
Anime 
101 
education. Moreover, (and 
to be honest I don’t really 
know if this is really just 
a problem with the series 
as a whole) I really don’t 
understand what Antoni’s 
point was here. Cultural 
exchange with apple pie 
is acceptable I suppose, 
but given that the skills the contestants learn are 
supposed to eventually help in their own day-to-
day life, maybe it would be more useful to bring on 
a Japanese chef to help cook simple Japanese food? 
In general, I would have loved to have seen more 
Japanese “counterparts” to the Fab Five, as they 
would have intimate knowledge of the nuances of 
their culture and provide learning opportunities 
for the Fab Five and presumably mostly American 
audience.
At this rate, the producers of “Queer Eye” seem 
to know what makes a hit, and they’re content with 
recycling it over and over. Luckily for them, even the 
recycled formula does produce some comforting TV.

‘Queer Eye’ went to Japan

SAYAN GHOSH

The classic opera “La Boheme,” composed by 
Giacomo Puccini, is beyond iconic. Not only is the 
score boundlessly beautiful, but the tragic story 
still rings true in each era that has followed its 
conception.
The plot of the opera is suspiciously relatable 
to most college students: young people living a 
penniless, open minded, unconventional lifestyle, 
surviving in subpar housing, gossiping about 
relationship drama and dealing with an array 
of diseases from late night adventures parading 
around the city. 
If librettists Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa’s 
four act plot is not enough for you, Puccini’s score 
will be. Puccini is widely known as one of the 
greatest opera composers of all time. His sweeping 
score for “La Boheme” is one of his most well 
known. This SMTD production brings Puccini’s 
score to life with a full SMTD orchestra as well as 
twelve members of the Michigan Marching Band 
playing on stage throughout the production in full 
costume. 
“La Boheme” is set in post-war 1947. Regardless 
of the time period, the premise is universal enough 
to be situated at any time. SMTD faculty member 
and director of the production, Matthew Ozawa, 
decided on the 1947 setting because of the stark 
contrast between the massive despair of World War 
II and the young aspiring artists who have faith in 
the future. This contrast makes the opposition in 
the story that much more heartbreaking. 
“The idea of people having just gone through war 
… they have to find so much through their artistry 

and through each other to gain back that sense of 
humanity that maybe had been lost,” Ozawa said. 
“‘La Boheme’ is quite possibly the perfect first 
opera to go to,” said conductor Kenneth Keisler in 
an interview with The Daily.
Even though the opera is technically tragic, 
there are long moments of comedy, and the heart 
of the show is pure gold. Each character, especially 
the main lovers Mimi and Rodolpho, have such 
strong dreams and aspirations that it’s difficult not 
to fall in love with them. 
The idea of turning to each other instead of 
material things to find happiness is something 
that I appreciate going into the winter months 
here at Michigan. Our vice is more along the 
lines of Netflix instead of jewels from the Paris 
bourgeoisie, but I believe the thought carries over. 
“What’s so interesting to me is that the artists 
really have to struggle to have food and heat … it’s 
their art that creates the beauty and hope of life.” 
Ozawa said. Taking Ozawa’s advice, I will happily 
lean into my last winter here. My art will probably 
be better for it.

BOOK REVIEW

People watching, the search for cultural identity 
and the subtleties of growing up in the city gracefully 
intertwine as Su Hwang offers her upbringing to the 
reader in her poetry collection “Bodega.” Born in 
Korea shortly before immigrating to New York City, 
Hwang uses her experiences to develop an expansive 
collection of memories of partial assimilation that she 
relays through 
her collection 
of 
poems. 
Every 
reader 
experiences 
years 
of 
growing up in 
an immigrant 
household 
in 
the 
mere 
94 
pages 
of 
“Bodega.” 
Those 
who 
have 
already 
experienced this phenomenon will find the 
experience even more vivid as their own flashbacks 
enhance Hwang’s already robust sentiments.
Hwang’s exceptional ability for photographic 
description is the vehicle through which she shares 

the experience of growing up in a land separated 
from her heritage. Each vignette incorporates a more 
creatively accurate degree of detail than one would 
receive through their own eyesight. In the bodega-set 
poem “Instant Scratch Off,” 
Hwang picks up on the slight 
tensions between interacting 
members of different racial 
groups while incorporating 
unmistakable features of the 
individuals, like a Nigerian 
man’s “salt-and-pepper hair 
gathered into a seahorse.”
This 
meticulous 
level 
of 
physical 
and 
social 
observation juxtaposes the 
more rushed and self-centered 
standard protocol of bodega 
visitors, giving the everyday 
scene its seemingly more rare 
quality. The scene epitomizes 
what makes Hwang’s writing 
so charming and impactful: 
She 
manages 
to 
analyze 
situations and states of mind 
that many people, especially 
those of immigrant families, 
have been through on a more 
thorough level than most are 
willing to do — perhaps at times as a self defense 
mechanism.
Hwang’s most chilling works are those that tackle 
the issue of feeling stuck between cultures — being 

excluded from exposure to the experiences typical 
of growing up in her homeland, yet being equally 
deprived of the aspects of culture that seem inherent 
to those who are more historically American. It 
is the existential battle fought by the children of 
immigrant households as they endeavor to escape 
the cultural purgatory between their family and 
their surroundings.
Hwang 
convincingly 
highlights 
this 
all-
encompassing lack of belonging: “There’s no place 
like home / There’s no place like home / There’s no one 
place.” 
The 
moment 
one 
begins life in a 
new land, they 
begin to lose 
their heritage 
— 
“Family 
trees reduced 
/ to oral / 
traditions” 
— 
but 
one 
never 
fully 
assimilates 
to 
the 
new 
culture. Hwang’s pained awareness on this matter 
grants her collection the honest and raw nature that 
makes it so captivating to any audience and relatable 
to those who have undergone similar experiences.
The 
intersections 
of 
Hwang’s 
meticulous 
descriptions of her surroundings and her self-aware 
portrayals of internal conflicts above all connect her 
distinct talents to give the greatest insight to her 
immigrant upbringing. In “Fresh Off the Boat | Five 
Sonnets,” she addresses an interaction in which her 
family is verbally assaulted and then told to go back to 
where they came from. The remainder of the sonnet 
has two focuses: Her family’s reactions (from the 
fear in everyone’s eyes to her brother’s tearful face 
in her embrace) and her internal response, which 
intertwines profound anger and speechlessness 
with an underlying wish that she can simply escape 
to a place where she feels actual belonging. Hwang’s 
ability to echo these themes of racial tension and 
exclusion in her discussion of seemingly unrelated 
household 
memories 
and 
casual 
observances 
gives 
her collection a seamless 
consistency from one poem to 
another that few authors can 
maintain over the course of an 
entire collection.
This, then, is Hwang’s 
secret recipe to an impressive 
poetry 
collection. 
Her 
technique is deliberate and 
perfected, 
implementing 
hyper-realistic 
description 
without 
getting 
caught 
up in the frills of overly 
elaborate devices. As she 
adds transparent sentiments 
regarding 
her 
struggle 
and that of immigrants in 
her 
periphery, 
her 
vivid 
descriptions absorb the reader 
and she sees from her eyes 
what it means to grow up in an 
immigrant household. Most 
works attempting to do so still 
cause the reader to feel like an outsider looking in, but 
Hwang’s readers gaze out at an unaccepting world.

Insight into the immigrant
experience with ‘Bodega’

Scrolling through Gracie Abrams’s Instagram 
(yes, J.J. Abrams’s daughter) is like flipping 
through her diary. Her aesthetic is the glow of 
Christmas lights with polaroid pictures taped to 
her bedroom walls, Muji pens scribbling journal 
entries, posts of political activism and snippets 
of her humming voice amongst the hue of those 
festive lights. 
By opening the pages of her diary, so to speak, 
on Instagram, Abrams consistently lets the 
viewer step into the warmth of her wistful room. 
She’s been at this for years: three years ago she 
posted a snippet of a song called “Minor.” I fell 
in love with the romantic teenage earnestness 
she exuded, as if “Minor” was a walk through 
the movie “Me and Earl and The Dying Girl.” 
“Minor” is a longing, youthful love letter. She 
whispers the lyrics: “I’ll put on a show, if you just 
come over. I’m sorry your house is in Glendale, 
or somewhere far.” 
Gracie has built up a cult following on 
Instagram in the three years since. In these years 
of fragmented songs, fans consistently voiced 
their restlessness, begging for her to release 
something official. On Oct. 24, 2019, she finally 
debuted her first official single “Mean It,” along 
with a VEVO verified music video. Accordingly, 
the song feels like a walk inside the glimmer 
of Gracie’s room. The music video features her 
placing objects inside her room, whispering her 
woes with a pouty face as she sprawls across her 
bed. The intimacy of this powerhouse teenage 
femininity I had followed on my feed for years 
had finally broke onto the official scene. 
It’s important to note that the term diary 
particularly stirs up images of femininity, and 
her Instagram and various media outlets are 
described as diary-esque. I believe what drew 
me most to Abrams is this exactly: her capture 
of the “diary energy” of the teenage girl, and 
the power she brought to it. The dewy skin 
and hoodies with her soft spoken voice that’s 
knifelike, the dreamy bedroom and wistfulness 
— three years ago she let me feel power in this, as 
I was 17, figuring out where my power could be. 
Her instagram launched her into the respects 
of Lorde, Clairo, FINNEAS and the producers 

she formally works with today. Seeing the magic 
of the teenage bedroom transformed into a 
palpable power that garnered intense respect 
of powerful producers felt like watching Clairo 
rise, but without the rush and with the space to 
breathe. 
Growing up with artists like Arianna Grande 
and Nicki Minaj, I pondered if in order to 
be empowered as a female, the teenage girl 
bedroom-centric aesthetic had to be suppressed. 

Abrams is refreshing in this way — she has an 
authority that doesn’t need to be menacing 
or sexy or embody male characteristics to be 
taken seriously. She’s a soft vocal, and she’s 
authoritative in being her. 
Abrams rose and broke in by opening her diary, 
letting us flip through the pages and showing 
how this version of the teenage girl is a force to 
be reckoned with, as is every other version. 
I’ve been listening to Gracie Abrams in my 
room, my Christmas lights bouncing off of my 
poster-filled walls, while I sit criss-crossed on 
my white comforter. I used to be embarrassed 
by the term “diary.” Artists like Gracie make 
me feel powerful in this space, journaling in my 
bedroom. Gracie’s debut single is this space for 
me. If you want to feel the power of girls in their 
bedrooms scribbling up thoughts and dreams, 
listen to “Mean It.”

Gracie Abrams delivers 
the warm glow of a diary

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

Over the past few weeks, Martin Scorsese (“The Irishman”) has 
made a number of comments in regards to the Marvel Cinematic 
Universe and how he does not believe that it constitutes cinema. This 
sparked a wave of controversy, with numerous MCU directors such 
as James Gunn (“Guardians of the Galaxy”) and Joss Whedon (“The 
Avengers”) entering the fray to defend their work. Bob Iger, the CEO 
of the Disney Corporation, invited Scorsese to get dinner with him 
to discuss his feelings. Twitter was in a full on war against the man, 
decrying Scorsese as an out of touch auteur. Many across the Internet 
saw this as a quintessential moment in which 
to say, “OK, boomer.” However, all of this 
anger at Scorsese is entirely misplaced. Simply 
put, the man could not be more right.
Since “Iron Man” was released in 2008, 
there have been almost 25 films released in 
the MCU. In that time there have also been 
countless DC flicks, X-Men movies, an attempt 
to reboot the Fantastic Four, and two different 
reboots of Spider-Man. Every movie studio has 
tried their hand at creating their own version 
of the cash cow franchise of the decade and 
most have failed. The DC cinematic universe 
crashed and burned with “Justice League,” 
the so called “Dark Universe” never made it 
past the Tom Cruise helmed “The Mummy” 
and Universal’s “MonsterVerse” has hit rough 
waters after the mixed reviews and lower 
box office numbers for “Godzilla: King of the 
Monsters.” If anyone out there in the world today believes that any 
of the people behind these “cinematic universes” had their eyes on 
anything other than money, they are sorely mistaken. 
What constitutes “cinema” can be debated all day long. Yes, the 
MCU films are moving pictures with audio attached to them that play 
in movie theaters and are usually seen while eating popcorn. They are 
ostensibly pieces of cinema in the sense that they exist within what 
we have come to define as cinema for a century. But as Scorsese points 
out, these films lack certain characteristics that most good movies 

have. They do not attempt to say anything compelling about society 
or the world at large. And despite what their legions of proponents 
will tell you, they do nothing to advance film as an artform. They are 
glorified amusement park rides, and nothing more. 
Characters in the MCU don’t have “arcs” in the way that most 
characters do in serialized fiction. While the characters do occasionally 
change, these changes often occur off-screen and are flip-of-the-
switch moments in which a character is completely different than 
they were before. For most of the series, Bruce Banner/The Hulk’s 
main storyline is his inability to balance the two halves of his life. 
Between the two most recent “Avengers” films, that problem is solved 
off-screen. That is not an arc. Many will point to Iron Man’s sacrifice 
at the end of “Endgame” as an example of how far the character has 
grown, but they conveniently leave out the fact 
that he was ready to make the same sacrifice at 
the end of the original “Avengers” film that was 
released seven years ago. If he has grown, he has 
grown to end up in the exact same place.
Certainly, there was a time when people 
decried other works of popular fiction as being 
devoid of deeper meaning and existing only to 
serve the whims of the masses. “Star Wars,” 
“Harry Potter” and “Lord of the Rings” all faced 
these criticisms in their own time. And yet all 
three of those franchises exhibit those crucial 
items that the Marvel movies as of yet have 
lacked. Those stories are all about something. 
“Star Wars” is about family, “Harry Potter” is 
about love and “Lord of the Rings” is about the 
power of the human will. Are these simple and 
universal themes? Yes. But nonetheless those 
stories have beginnings, middles and ends. 
Characters grow and change and are fundamentally different people 
at the beginning than they are at the end. Each of these series was not 
(at first) created simply to fill a tub full of money, but to tell a story 
that the author wished to tell. Who is the author of the MCU? Is it 
Kevin Feige, the producer? Is it the Russo brothers? Is it the Disney 
company? No one knows for sure because the series has no true 
author. It’s an amalgamation of ideas designed mainly to make as 
much money as possible. Scorsese says it isn’t cinema, but that’s just 
semantics. The actual problem is that it isn’t a real story.

Bigs leading the way to positionless basketball

Friday, November 8, 2019 // TIPOFF 2019
3B 

F

or decades, basketball has 
been a mostly specialized 
sport, with specific, stan-
dardized roles 
drawn up for 
the different 
positions on 
the court. 
The smaller, 
more athletic 
guards captain 
the offense, take 
the ball up the 
floor, call plays, 
find open team-
mates on passes 
and hit medium to long-range shots. 
The taller, stronger forwards and 
centers work to out-muscle the 
other team, using their size to pick 
up easy buckets inside, set screens 
to free up guards in space, dominate 
in the post and clog up inside lanes 
on defense. Players’ roles are set to 
match their skill sets, and for almost 
all of basketball history, this has 
been the preferred system. 
But things have started to 
change. Accessibility to the game 
at a young age and more advanced 
training methods have allowed 
players at every position to develop 
more diverse skill sets. Guards that 
rely on their quickness and ballhan-
dling to get into space now have for-
wards that can help space the floor 
and move the ball, freeing up more 
passing and scoring opportunities 
for playmakers. 
For the Michigan women’s 
basketball team, the transition to 
“positionless basketball” appears to 
be well on its way, and the success 
of this system should be a major 
difference-maker this season.
In their exhibition match against 
Northwood last Friday, every player 
in the Wolverines’ starting lineup 
measured at least 6-feet tall. While 
basketball players being tall is noth-
ing new, Michigan’s combination of 
size and speed from the traditional 
guard spot can take pressure off 
the forwards on defense and cre-
ate a more diverse attack down 
low offensively — evidenced by the 
Wolverines’ 58 points in the paint 
against Northwood. 
Granted, Northwood is a Division 
II team, so putting up big numbers 
against them doesn’t mean much for 
Michigan’s success later in the year. 
But it at least indicates that the Wol-
verines are willing to fully commit 
to a positionless system. 
Adapting to the scheme will be 

especially crucial for Michigan’s 
bigs if they want this new offense to 
be effective. 
Positionless systems rely on the 
ability of forwards and centers to 
dribble and pass effectively, move 
quickly and establish themselves 
as threats on the perimeter. This 
draws defenders to the outside and 
opens up space for guards and other 
bigs to break inside 
for easy buckets. 
“We just 
watched the 
WNBA Champion-
ship … there are 
players on the court 
— pretty much 
every single one of 
them, 6-(foot)-2, 
6-(foot)-3, 6-(foot)-
4 — that can bring 
the basketball up, 
that can handle the ball, that can 
pass the ball, that can shoot the 
three, that can post you up inside,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “And I think our (bigs) want 
to play at the next level and they see 
that. … They want to work on their 
handle every day in practice, and 
they want to be able to get a rebound 
and advance the ball with the ball in 

their hands without always having 
to find a point guard.”
Sophomore forward Naz Hillmon 
should be the most important key 
in the adjustment to positionless 
basketball. Coming off of a stellar 
freshman season where she led the 
team in points, rebounds and shoot-
ing percentage — all while coming 
off the bench — the 6-foot-2 Big 
Ten Freshman of 
the Year will need 
to adapt her game 
to fit the offense’s 
positionless style. 
While she spent 
most of last year 
generating offense 
in the post, she’ll 
have to find ways to 
score points from 
further away from 
the basket as oppo-
nents work to neutralize her post 
presence this year. 
“That’s a challenge that she’s 
really embraced and really worked 
hard on in the offseason,” Barnes 
Arico said. “And we gotta constantly 
remind her, ‘Hey Naz, that’s a good 
shot, you gotta take those shots 
instead of just looking to be a passer 
in those situations,’ and I think 

that’s something that she really 
wants to get better at in order to 
take those next steps.”
Positionless basketball also 
means that Hillmon will need to 
move the ball quickly in transi-
tion. Assuming she maintains her 
dominance in defensive rebound-
ing from last year, she’ll likely find 
herself in situations where she has 
to either find a team-
mate or dribble up the 
floor and score points 
herself. 
“I feel like I can play 
a role in that,” Hillmon 
said. “Just getting up 
and down the floor, 
running my lane, and 
trying to get some easy 
buckets in transition, 
to really try to get the 
ball out.”
Michigan should also be able to 
count on true freshman Izabel Vare-
jão’s diverse skill set to complement 
its positionless system. 
The 6-foot-4 center uses her 
quickness and outside shooting abil-
ity — two of the most sought-after 
traits in a positionless big — to coun-
ter her strong post presence. These 
skills are especially valuable in the 

pick-and-roll game, where a player 
traditionally sets a high screen 
for the ball carrier, then slips back 
toward the basket for the pass and 
an easy bucket. Varejão’s shooting 
means she can roll down low or pop 
back outside for an open jumpshot, 
adding yet another element that 
defenses have to worry about. 
With the transition to a position-
less system, the 
Wolverines have 
put themselves 
in a position to 
attack defenses 
in a new way 
this season. But 
their success 
will rely heavily 
on the ability 
and willingness 
of Michigan’s 
bigs to adapt. 
With a wealth of talent on the 
roster this year, this could be the 
difference between an ascending 
program taking the next step or fall-
ing back into the Big Ten’s forgotten 
middle tier.

Fifteen seconds remained in the fourth 
quarter of the gold-medal match in the 
Under-19 Women’s World Cup. The United 
States and Naz Hillmon were staring down 
the barrel of a defeat to Australia as, back 
to the basket, Hillmon posted up against 
an Australian defender on the top of the 
key. She watched as two of her teammates 
crossed in front of her, waiting for the 
inbound and a chance to tie the game at 66.
***
Two years earlier, Hillmon had tried out 
for the United States under-17 national 
team. She fought and battled through 
trials, making it to the final round of cuts.
She didn’t make the team, instead 
designated an alternate.
“I had never seen her so devastated in her 
life,” said Hillmon’s mother, NaSheema 
Anderson. “So we went back to the 
drawing board — what could you have 
done differently, what could you work 
on? They gave her things she could work 
on, and she spent the next year getting 
stronger, getting shots up, adding some 
components and dimensions to her game.”
The next year, Hillmon went back to 
Colorado and made the under-18 team, 
won a gold medal in the Americas 
Championship and went on to be the 
Big Ten’s Sixth Player of the Year and 
first team All-Big Ten as a freshman at 
Michigan.
Three months before she would face off 
against Australia, Hillmon was bugging 
her mom. One by one, her friends across 
the country received letters inviting them 
to come to Colorado and try out for the 
under-19 team, to play in the World Cup 
in Thailand, and she didn’t receive one.
Her mom had kept it from her, to make 
sure she wasn’t just doing this to please 
her family. Finally, Hillmon was brought 
into the loop. She made her way to 
Colorado.

After five days of trials, the team was 
ready to be announced. Hillmon called 
her mom beforehand, debriefing her on 
her chances and when the results would 
be announced — while her mom teased 
out the excitement, Hillmon wasn’t going 
to make her wait.
The time ticked by, Hillmon’s deadline 
went by, USA basketball’s deadline went 
by. Anderson was sent out texts to other 
parents, refreshed Twitter, did the math 
as reports trickled in of players who had 
been cut.
She didn’t want to watch her daughter be 
dealt a blow like the one two years prior.
As they listed the players who made the 
team alphabetically, five bigs were called 
before her, nearly filling her position 
group and increasing the chances she was 
an alternate.
Finally, she called her mom.
The coaches reached H. Her name was 
called. Hillmon would be one of just three 
players to play for both the under-18 and 
under-19 teams.
***
Taking the inbound, guard Paige Bueckers 
launched the ball from center court, arcing 
over the head of the posted-up Hillmon, 
into the hands of a streaking Hailey Van 
Lith.
***
Three weeks before the championship, in 
July, right as the Wolverines began their 
summer camps, Hillmon went to Tokyo.
As she set off for Japan, she was filled 
with the advice of Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico, who had coached the same 
tournament ten years earlier.
“She knew how important it is to 
represent USA across your chest and how 
much it was about basketball,” Hillmon 
said. “She wanted me to enjoy it and take 
in the experience.”
Twelve of the best 18 year-olds from 

around the country — some high school, 
some college — landed for their pre-
tournament scrimmage against Japan.
For most, it was their first time 
playing together. The chemistry wasn’t 
established.
Hillmon, who played for the same coaches 
the year before, stepped up.
“Because I was one of the older girls, I 
needed to take responsibility over what 
was going on, on and off the court,” 
Hillmon said. “(I knew) the coaches … (I 
knew) what they liked and how to help 
the people just coming in.”
But it was a process. Chemistry doesn’t 
come easy.
The bus tour through the heart of Tokyo, 
the team’s visit to the Grand Palace in 
Bangkok, the wisecracks and laughs 
throughout the tournament — it all built 
a family.
“You could just see the more time they 
spent together the more comfortable 
they are and the more they trusted each 
other,” Anderson said. “They wanted to 
play for one another and they wanted to 
win for their country.”
The scrimmage in Japan and the practices 
before the tournament in Thailand were a 
crash course in each other — what shots 
each player liked to take, what moves 
they made — what their strengths and 
weaknesses were.
***
Van Lith caught the ball a step ahead of 
her Australian defender. Using the space 
she had gained in a run to the top of the arc 
before a cut back to the hoop, she took one 
dribble toward the hoop — with Hillmon 
moving in to grab a potential rebound — 
faked her shot to get a clear look and sent 
up the potential game-saving shot.
***
In the first game of the tournament, eight 
days before the championship, Hillmon 

started against Australia. She stole the 
show as one of just four players on the 
team to score 10 points while also tallying 
a team-leading nine rebounds and five 
steals.
The pattern would continue.
Starting the whole tournament, she tallied 
three games with 10 or more rebounds 
over the course of the tournament, 
consistently having one of the best plus-
minus margins on the team.
Hillmon’s tireless work on the court was 
mirrored by her leadership off it, using 
her voice to empower and better her 
teammates, while she improved herself.
“I learned a lot about myself, in terms 
of how I could compete against some of 
the best in the country,” Hillmon said. 
“I figured out when people stop this 
that or another move, you have to have 
three or four more counters. And also 
learning how to put my teammates in 
better positions, working out with girls 
that you’ve never played with before 
and having a month, you have to hone in 
and make sure you put them in the best 
positions.”
Her growth over the course of the 
tournament snowballed, culminating in 
her being named captain the night before 
the final game — she was no longer just 
an alternate.
She neglected to tell her mom.
***
Minutes before Van Lith’s catch, Hillmon 
was racing down the court toward her 
own basket.
The seconds were counting down. Three 
points behind Australia, the gold medal 
was slipping out of the USA’s grasp. The 
only option left for the United States was 
to foul and hope the Opals missed their 
shots.
“I had no idea how (coach Jeff Walz) was 
going to pull that off,” Anderson said.

HILLMON’S QUEST FOR GOLD

KENT SCHWARTZ / DAILY SPORTS WRITER

“I turned to (guard Rhyne Howard’s) 
mom and I’m like, ‘We did not come to 
Thailand to get a silver medal.’
“‘What is he going to pull out? What is he 
possibly going to do?’”
It was going to be a long fifteen seconds.
Howard went for the first foul, reaching 
around Australia’s Isobel Anstey. Trying 
to waste time by avoiding the foul as long 
as possible, Antsey twisted her upper 
body back in Howard’s direction.
Her elbow went straight into Howard’s 
nose.
The flagrant, accidental foul gave two free 
throws and the ball to the United States. 
After making one of two free throws, the 
ball was inbounded by mid-court.
Hillmon posted herself near the elbow, 
with two of her teammates crossing in 
front of her. Van Lith made her move, and 
the ball was lofted over everyone to her. 
She jump-stepped, faked her shot and 
ducked. Her shaken defender tumbled 
over her, before she banked in the game-
tying shot.
With 12 seconds left, Australia was unable 
to hit the game-winning shot, sending the 
match to overtime.
A team that the United States beat by 23 
in the first game of the tournament was 
fifteen seconds and free throws away 
from winning the gold medal against the 
United States. They couldn’t close it out.
In overtime, Hillmon gathered four 
rebounds and scored two points. The 
United States won the gold medal, 74-70.
When 
the 
medals 
were 
awarded, 

they called for the captain. Anderson 
watched, feet away, as her daughter — 
whose dismay two years ago had worried 
her so much she kept the invitation to 
the trials from Hillmon to make sure she 
really wanted to go through the process 
again — walked forward and lifted the 
trophy.

Roster breakdown

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team is coming off 
its 
second 
consecutive 
NCAA 
Tournament appearance, and for 
the second consecutive season, 
the Wolverines have undergone 
a significant amount of roster 
turnover. 
With 
Hallie 
Thome 
and Nicole Munger graduating 
and Deja Church transferring, 
Michigan has three starting spots 
to fill and 30.6 points per game to 
replace.
Despite that, the expectations 
for the Wolverines are as high 
as they have been in coach Kim 
Barnes Arico’s eight years with 
the team, largely due to strong 
recruiting classes over the past two 
years. The 2018 class was the most 
highly-touted of Barnes Arico’s 
tenure, consisting of three top-100 
recruits, two of whom — Amy Dilk 
and Naz Hillmon — had significant 
roles as freshmen. This year, 
Michigan brings in three talented 
players who have all shown the 
ability to make an impact as 
freshmen. 
But 
with 
roster 
turnover 
comes 
questions 
about 
depth. 
The Wolverines only have five 
returning players who averaged 
over five points per game last year 
— all of whom project as starters 
— and will look to inexperienced 
players to fill important roles 
coming off the bench. Additionally, 
one of Michigan’s main focuses 
in the offseason was to improve 
defensively to alleviate the loss of 
three of its four leading scorers. 
The Daily breaks down what 
to expect from the Wolverines’ 
starters and who can step up and 
produce in addition to those five.
Guards
Sophomore Amy Dilk is one of 
Michigan’s two returning starters, 
and the Wolverines will look to her 
to be one of the team’s top scorers 
this season. Dilk came in last 
season and immediately earned 
the starting point guard spot. But 
with many proven scorers on the 
roster, she was asked to focus more 
on distributing than scoring the 
basketball. 
While her freshman season had 
some ups and downs, Dilk showed 
the ability to be a proficient floor 
general, averaging 4.4 assists per 

game with excellent court vision, 
but turned the ball over 3.4 times 
per game. Dilk’s ability to score 
more consistently and improve 
upon her 7.2 points per game, along 
with cutting down on turnovers, 
will be key to Michigan’s success 
this season.
As a result of losing three 
starters, senior Akienreh Johnson 
will consistently start for the 
Wolverines for the first time in her 
college career. Johnson’s career has 
been derailed by injuries a bit — a 
torn ACL caused her to miss a large 
portion of her freshman year, and 
she missed the first three games 
last season due to a broken hand 
— but as a senior she will have the 
opportunity to step up as a leader 
for Michigan. While not the most 
prolific scorer on the team, she 
showed that she can set the tone 
for the Wolverines offensively in an 
exhibition against Northwood last 
Wednesday, scoring seven first-
quarter points. Johnson is also one 
of Michigan’s best defenders, and 
leads by example on the defensive 
end.
Behind Johnson and Dilk, it is 
unclear which of the Wolverines’ 
four reserve guards will step up 
and contribute off the bench, and 
it seems like all four will have the 
opportunity to earn minutes. 
Michigan added two freshman 
guards to the roster this season, 
Maddie Nolan and Michelle Sidor, 
both of whom can contribute 
immediately. Nolan is coming 
off a serious knee injury that 
she suffered during her senior 
year of high school, but against 
Northwood, it didn’t seem to affect 
her play. She could earn minutes 
due to her aggressiveness, which 
was on display on Wednesday as 
she dove on the floor for loose balls 
and hustled for offensive rebounds. 
Sidor scored over 3,000 points in 
high school and can play both the 
‘1’ and the ‘2.’ Her tendency to push 
the pace when running the point 
could provide Michigan with a 
change of pace off the bench. 
Michigan’s 
two 
more 
experienced reserve guards — 
sophomore Danielle Rauch and 
junior Priscilla Smeenge — both 
played very limited minutes last 
season. With no clear backup point 
guard, Rauch made her case for the 
job after logging six assists in just 
16 minutes against Northwood. 

Barnes Arico identified both Rauch 
and Smeenge as potential sparks 
off the bench due to their high-
energy style of play. 
Forwards
Coming off the bench in her 
freshman 
season, 
sophomore 
Naz Hillmon led the Wolverines 
in scoring, rebounding and field 
goal percentage en route to being 
named the Big Ten Freshman of 
the Year, Big Ten Sixth Player of the 
Year and being named to the All-
Big Ten First Team. This season, 
Hillmon will be asked to play more 
minutes and potentially guard 
opposing centers, a challenge that 
will require her to improve as a 
defender. 
Due to the departure of many of 
Michigan’s top scorers, Hillmon 
will also be the primary option for 
the Wolverines on offense. She is 
dominant in the paint, but in order 
to diversify her game and combat 
increased 
defensive 
attention, 
Hillmon has worked to improve her 
perimeter scoring ability. Hillmon 
is 
Michigan’s 
most 
important 
player, and whether or not she can 
improve upon her freshman season 
will be the an important factor for 
the Wolverines if they are going to 

finish at the top of the Big Ten. 
Entering her third season as a 
starter, junior Hailey Brown has 
the most starting experience of any 
player on the team. Her ability to 
score both in the post and on the 
perimeter makes her a versatile 
secondary option for Michigan.
The Wolverines’ other senior, 
Kayla Robbins, will also have the 
opportunity to start for the first 
time this season. Her length and 
strong defense gives her the ability 
to guard multiple positions and 
switch, which has allowed Barnes 
Arico to move her to the wing this 
season after playing predominantly 
the ‘4’ throughout her career. Along 
with Johnson, Robbins will anchor 
Michigan’s defense.
Depth is a concern, though, as 
sophomore Emily Kiser will start 
the season as the Wolverines’ only 
forward off the bench. 
Center
The lone center on Michigan’s 
roster is freshman Izabel Varejão, 
whose size can be an important 
factor for the Wolverines. None of 
the five starters are true centers, 
and if they struggle to defend 
opposing bigs, Varejão will be 
called on to play an important 

role. She has also proven that she 
can provide a scoring punch off 
the bench due to her effectiveness 
in the paint and ability to shoot 
the three, both of which were 
on display as Michigan’s leading 
scorer against Northwood. Foul 
trouble could be an issue for 
Varejão, but if she can stay on the 
floor, look for her to potentially 
play a role similar to Hillmon’s last 
season.
Outlook
This 
year’s 
Wolverines 
are 
relatively young and inexperienced, 
but a strong starting five and lots 
of talent up and down the roster 
provides the team with optimism 
that they can replicate last season’s 
success. If Sidor and Varejão can 
live up to their billing as scoring 
threats and acclimate well to 
the college game while the older 
bench players continue to improve, 
Michigan has the potential to 
finish in the top three of the Big 
Ten and make a third-straight trip 
to the NCAA Tournament. But if 
the Wolverines can’t find reliable 
bench contributors, there may 
be too much weight on the backs 
of the starters to reach their full 
potential.

Jack Kingsley, Brendan Roose 
and Kent Schwartz contributed to 
this story.
Michigan finished last season 
fourth in the Big Ten and with a 
good chunk of teams competing 
for real estate at the top of the 
conference standings, life won’t 
be getting any easier. Here’s 
everything you need to know 
about the Big Ten’s top teams this 
year. 
No. 4 Maryland
After winning the Big Ten 
regular season title last year, the 
Big Ten is Maryland’s to lose. The 
Terrapins are ranked in the top 
five in both the AP and Coaches 
preseason polls, in large part due 
to the return of all five starters, 
including Kaila Charles. Charles 
averaged 17 points per game last 
season and was named both a 
preseason All-American and the 

preseason Big Ten Player of the 
Year. 
Maryland also brings in the 
third-ranked freshman class in 
the nation, led by seventh-ranked 
recruit Ashley Owusu, which 
gives the Terrapins much more 
depth than in prior seasons. The 
biggest challenge for them will be 
whether or not their uber-talented 
freshmen can adjust to secondary 
roles, but coach Brenda Frese is 
confident that their difficult non-
conference schedule will help 
them figure out how to balance 
everyone’s minutes. 
The Big Ten has many teams 
with 
NCAA 
Tournament 
aspirations 
this 
season, 
but 
Maryland is a step above the rest 
and a legitimate threat to win the 
national title.
No. 17 Michigan State
After their 2018-19 campaign 
ended with a blowout loss to Notre 
Dame in the second round of the 
NCAA Tournament, the Spartans 
enter this season ranked 17th in 

the preseason AP Poll. 13th-year 
coach Suzy Merchant may have 
her most talented roster in years, 
with 
four 
returning 
starters, 
including guards Shay Colley, 
Taryn 
McCutcheon 
and 
Nia 
Clouden, all of whom earned All-
Big Ten honors last season. 
Michigan State will be tested 
early in non-conference play, when 
they travel to South Bend to take 
on No. 16 Notre Dame. To take a 
step up as a program this year and 
compete in these tough games, 
the Spartans will need to rely on 
some of their younger players 
for depth — their 2019 recruiting 
class includes five players from the 
Collegiate Girls Basketball Report 
Top 100. 
They probably won’t compete 
with Maryland for the regular 
season conference championship, 
but don’t be surprised if the 
Spartans make some noise in the 
Big Ten Tournament or even pull 
off an upset in the second round of 
the NCAA Tournament. 

No. 23 Minnesota
The Golden Gophers did not 
make the NCAA Tournament last 
season after finishing 21-11, but 
the return of three of their top 
four scorers led to a No. 23 rank in 
the preseason AP poll. The return 
of an all-Big Ten player in Destiny 
Pitts gives Minnesota optimism 
that it can take the next step in 
coach Lindsay Whalen’s second 
year despite the loss of leading 
scorer Kenisha Bell.
However, their season got off to 
a rough start after losing at home 
to unranked Missouri State on 
Tuesday. The result showed that 
the loss of Bell will take some time 
to adjust to, and may be too much 
for Minnesota to overcome to live 
up to the preseason hype.
No. 24 Indiana
The Hoosiers limped to a 
disappointing 
8-10 
conference 
record last year, but they still 
earned an at-large bid in the 
NCAA Tournament, where they 
were bounced in the second round 

by No. 2 seed Oregon. This year, 
Indiana returns all but one of its 
regular players from last season, 
making the Hoosiers poised to 
compete for one of the top spots in 
the Big Ten. 
Redshirt 
junior 
guard 
Ali 
Patberg led the team in scoring 
last year, with 15.8 points per 
game. 
Her 
offensive 
prowess 
earned her a spot on the All-
Big Ten second team and on the 
preseason Naismith Award watch 
list, so expect her to put up even 
bigger numbers as she continues 
to develop this year. 
Out of every team on this list 
not named Maryland, Indiana 
might have the highest ceiling 
since it returns so much talent, 
but the Hoosiers are still largely 
unproven on the big stage. It’s hard 
to see this team taking a step back, 
though, so expect the Hoosiers to 
make it to the second round of the 
NCAA Tournament, at least.

Rutgers
The Scarlet Knights enter the 
2019-20 season missing four out of 
five starters from last year’s team 
that finished third in the Big Ten. 
They can hope to fill some of that 
gap with five-star center Maori 
Davenport, and redshirt junior 
guard Arella Guirantes also seems 
poised for a big season — scoring 
27 points in Rutgers’ season 
opener against South Alabama on 
Tuesday. 
Still, replacing four out of five 
starters is no easy task for any team, 
so expect the Scarlet Knights to 
take somewhat of a step back this 
season. They’re almost certainly 
too inexperienced to compete for 
the Big Ten regular season title, 
but coach C. Vivian Stringer — 
entering her 25th season — could 
very well salvage some upset wins 
near the end of the season. With a 
strong enough showing in the Big 
Ten Tournament, Rutgers can still 
definitely find itself an at-large bid 

in the NCAA Tournament. 
Iowa
Coming off a run to the Elite 
Eight, a second place finish in the 
Big Ten and a Big Ten Tournament 
Championship, the expectations 
for Iowa this year are significantly 
lower than last. No team in the Big 
Ten has a bigger hole to fill than 
the hole left by Megan Gustafson, 
the nation’s leading scorer and Big 
Ten player of the year a season 
ago. Iowa also loses double-digit 
scorers Hannah Stewart and Tania 
Davis from last season’s team. 
But the Hawkeyes still have 
reason for optimism this year in 
large part to the return of all-Big 
Ten guard Kathleen Doyle and an 
experienced, successful coach in 
2019 Naismith National Coach of 
the Year Lisa Bluder. This season 
will be a true test for a program 
that has had so much success 
throughout Bluder’s tenure, but 
Iowa has the potential for another 
top-three Big Ten finish. 
Purdue
Looking for a team that could 
surprise in the Big Ten? Look no 
further than the Boilermakers. 
Purdue has two players named to 

the preseason all-Big Ten team 
in Ae’Rianna Harris and Karissa 
McLaughlin 
and 
returns 
all 
five starters. The Boilermakers 
finished near the bottom of the Big 
Ten last year, but this year’s team 
is much more experienced. While 
they haven’t gotten much national 
attention, their No. 5 ranking in 
the preseason Big Ten coaches poll 
shows that Big Ten coaches think 
they can be a threat.
Ohio State
The Buckeyes put up a flat 10-8 
conference record last season, 
earning them fifth place in the Big 
Ten. This season, they will have 
to make the most out of a young 
roster that features only three 
upperclassmen. Fortunately, they 
scooped up the fourth-ranked 
recruiting class in the country, so 
the talent is there. 
Among returners, sophomore 
guard Janai Crooms is poised 
to take a step up offensively this 
season, while the addition of junior 
transfer 
wing 
Braxtin 
Miller 
adds depth to an already talented 
position group. Still, Ohio State is 
just too young to compete at the 
top level of this year’s Big Ten, so 

expect the Buckeyes to remain in 
the middle of the pack. 
Nebraska
Nebraska 
comes 
into 
the 
season with its seven top scorers 
returning in coach Amy Williams’ 
fourth season. With four seniors, 
the team has an abundance of 
experience after their 14-16 overall 
record last season, including a 9-9 
finish in the Big Ten, where they 
managed to hold games close. The 
Cornhuskers will be able to attack 
opponents 
in 
many 
different 
ways and without worrying about 
having to play tired players — in 
their first game of the season, 
11 players played ten or more 
minutes. 
Northwestern
While the Wildcats are likely a 
tier below the top Big Ten teams, 
they do return all-Big Ten first-
teamer Lindsey Pulliam, a player 
who can give any team trouble on 
any given night. Injuries derailed a 
fast start to the season, but a 21-15 
finish and an impressive run to the 
WNIT championship game give 
Northwestern confidence that it 
can compete with the best of the 
Big Ten this season. A relatively 

weak 
non-conference 
schedule 
could make it difficult for the 
Wildcats to get an at-large bid in 
the NCAA Tournament unless 
they finish at the top of the Big 
Ten, but they could steal a couple 
of wins from the Big Ten’s best.
Bottom Tier
Penn 
State, 
Wisconsin 
and 
Illinois finished as the three 
worst teams in the Big Ten last 
year, finishing 5-13, 4-14 and 2-16 
in the conference, respectively. 
Penn State brought in the No. 18 
recruiting class in the country in 
2019, but it’s still hard to imagine 
the 
Nittany 
Lions 
competing 
beyond the middle of the pack this 
year. Don’t expect much change at 
the bottom of the standings. 
Outlook
Michigan has the talent to 
compete with the top tier of the 
Big Ten this year, but it’s hard to 
see them finishing higher than 
second, barring a collapse from 
the Terrapins. The Wolverines’ 
ceiling is a top three finish in the 
conference, but a slip or a few 
untimely injuries could see them 
sliding back into the middle tier of 
the Big Ten.
