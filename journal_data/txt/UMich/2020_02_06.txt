In 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
Michigan League’s Maizie’s 
Kitchen & Market, a dozen 
undergraduate 
students 
huddled around a laptop to 
sign in for their canvassing 
shifts. 
The 
small 
group 
decided to brave the January 
blizzard and knock doors for 
Solomon Rajput, a 27-year-
old Ann Arbor native who put 
his medical studies on hold 
for a year to challenge Rep. 
Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., for 
Michigan’s 12th congressional 

seat.
Dingell has represented the 
district for the last four years. 
Previously, it was held by the 
late John Dingell for 59 years 
and before that, by his father 
John Dingell Sr. for 22 years. 
Rajput hopes to disrupt this 
85-year-old political dynasty. 
He said he was interested 
in politics as a teenager but 
was disenchanted with how 
candidates 
seemed 
to 
be 
controlled by big corporations. 
Still 
looking 
to 
make 
a 
difference, Rajput decided to 
enter the medical field. 
“I ended up in medicine 
because it is a way to help 

people in a very vulnerable 
moment, heal people,” Rajput 
said. “I was thinking maybe 
we can change our health care 
system from the inside out.”
After Hillary Clinton lost 
the 2016 presidential election, 
Rajput’s political ambitions 
were 
reignited, 
leading 
him to found the activist 
organization 
Michigan 
Resistance. The goal of the 
group was to advocate for local 
progressive bills in the county 
and state legislature. Noting 
the success of progressive 
campaigns such as those run 
by 
U.S. 
Reps. 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, 

and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., 
in 2018, Rajput said he became 
hopeful that he, too, would 
be able to make a difference 
through politics.
In 
September 
2019, 
he 
decided to put his medical 
studies on the back burner 
and run for Dingell’s seat. 
“I 
feel 
like 
times 
are 
changing, and it’s actually 
really exciting because we 
have a new generation of 
leaders who are running for 
office. We’re saying we’re 
not going to be beholden to 
corporate interest any longer,” 
Rajput said.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Freezing 
temperatures, 
wind and swirling flurries 
of snow did not stop about 
25 students and Ann Arbor 
community members from 
gathering in the Diag for a 
candlelight vigil in support 
of sexual assault victims 
Wednesday night. 
The event was organized 
by 
the 
Sexual 
Assault 
Victims 
Alliance 
(SAVA), 
in conjunction with The 
Michigan 
Democracy 
Institute 
for 
Civic 

Engagement 
and 
Roe 
v. 
Rape. 
In order to protect the 
privacy of the speakers, they 
will be referred to only by 
their first names.
In an interview with The 
Daily, 
Candice, 
Eastern 
Michigan 
University 
student and an organizer of 
the event, spoke about the 
construction of the vigil.
“We wanted to have some 
kind of display that would 
show how many victims 
there are at U of M and how 
common it is here,” Candice 
said. “We thought that the 

candlelight vigil would be 
really awesome.”
Candice 
said 
events 
raising awareness of sexual 
assault 
are 
valuable 
for 
decreasing stigma.
“I think that events like 
this are super important, 
especially with taboo issues 
like sexual assault,” Candice 
explained. “When no one’s 
talking about the issue … 
you don’t really know that 
it exists — that people are 
struggling with it. Because 
no one is really open about 
it, so these events do a lot to 
educate people who maybe 

would be and will be our 
allies, but they don’t know 
what the problem is.”
She also expressed her 
surprise at the amount of 
enthusiasm she encountered 
while organizing the event.
“Almost every person I 
reached out to was really 
excited about it. I had really 
good engagement,” Candice 
said. “People were really 
excited 
and 
were 
really 
willing to contribute to the 
event, which I wasn’t really 
expecting.”

Candelight vigil draws community 
to share experiences of sexual assault

Michigan students gather on Diag Wednesday evening to demonstrate support

During 
a 
community 
meeting on diversity, equity 
and inclusion in Saline Area 
schools on Monday night, one 
man asked a Latinx parent 
why he had come to the 
United States, rather than 
“stay(ing) in Mexico.” The 
meeting was held following 
an incident last week at 
Saline High School when 
students were found posting 
racial slurs in a Snapchat 
group chat. 
The altercation occurred 
after 
Adrian 
Iraola, 
the 
father of three Saline school 
district alumni, shared his 
children’s experiences with 
racism during their years in 
Saline. In a video recorded 
by MLive, Iraola said other 
students called his children 
“taco, nacho and enchilada.” 
While Iraola was sharing 
his story, parent Tom Burtell 
interrupted and said, “Then 
why 
didn’t 
you 
stay 
in 
Mexico?” The remark was 
followed by gasps from the 
audience and various calls for 
Burtell to leave.

targets ‘U’

After a jury found the 
University of Michigan did 
not 
discriminate 
against 
a couple who accused the 
school of violating the state’s 
civil rights statute, a group of 
students minoring in Asian/
Pacific 
Islander 
American 
Studies authored an open 
letter to the University and 
public. The students outlined 
requirements they would like 
to be met to make them feel 
more supported.
On 
Dec. 
20, 
2019, 
a 
jury 
determined 
that 
the 
University 
did 
not 
discriminate against Emily 
Lawsin and Scott Kurashige, 
who filed a discrimination 
lawsuit in 2016 against the 
University under the Elliott-
Larsen 
Civil 
Rights 
Act, 
with 
claims 
of 
disparate 
treatment, 
discriminatory 
hiring 
practices 
and 
sex 
discrimination, 
among 
others. 
In the letter, the group of 
students introduced a path 
of action they would like to 
see the University embark 
on to improve their working 
relationship.

Study abroad 
programs in 
China face 
cancellation

LSA sophomore Katyanne 
Calleja planned on studying 
abroad 
for 
two 
semesters 
this summer in China when 
the program she had applied 
to was canceled due to the 
recent coronavirus outbreak 
and a lack of interest in the 
program. 
Calleja said not all of the 
abroad programs in China 
have been canceled, though 
there 
has 
been 
a 
lot 
of 
confusion 
among 
students 
hoping to still travel there 
over the summer. 
“I know so far that the 
Beijing one is not canceled 
and they say that they are just 
waiting to see what’s going 
to happen,” Calleja said. “I 
feel like the whole situation 
is kind of confusing because 
sometimes you hear things are 
canceled, but then sometimes 
it’s not.” 
Since 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
issued 
a 
travel 
restriction on Jan. 27 for the 
entire country of China due 
to 
the 
recent 
coronavirus 
outbreak, all undergraduate 
and most graduate student 
travel to China has been 

prohibited and many study 
abroad programs have been 
canceled. 
The 
University’s 
travel 
ban 
specifically 
discourages 
any 
“non-
essential” travel to China for 
students, faculty and staff 
and has affected all spring 
and summer study abroad 
programs 
affiliated 
with 
the Center for Global and 
Intercultural Study.
When 
contacted 
by 
The 
Daily, 
University 
spokeswoman 
Dana 
Elger 
referred all students, faculty 
and 
staff 
interested 
in 
learning more about the virus 
to the Key Issues section of 
the Office of Public Affairs’s 
website. On Friday, the page 
addressed the travel ban and 
the international and national 
threat from the coronavirus.
“The 
U.S. 
State 

Department 
classifies 

China as a level 4 travel 
advisory, recommending that 
individuals avoid all travel to 
the country,” the post reads. 
“The entire country remains 
under a U-M travel restriction. 
All U-M Related Travel to 
China, including for faculty 
and 
staff, 
is 
discouraged.

As a part of its LGBTQ 
Health and Wellness Week, the 
Spectrum Center hosted a talk 
titled Queer Martyrdom: The 
Religious and Sexual Politics 
of 
LGBTQ 
Inclusion. 
This 
event featured guest speaker 
Brett 
Krutzsch, 
a 
scholar 
from New York University 
and author of the book “Dying 
to Be Normal: Gay Martyrs 
and the Transformation of 
American 
Sexual 
Politics.” 
Krutzsch spoke to an audience 
of about 20 students, staff and 
community members. 
Krutzsch 
discussed 
both 

historical and modern issues 
pertaining to the intersection 
of religion and the LGBTQ+ 
community. He referenced two 
anecdotal stories about LGBTQ 
youth Matthew Shepard and 
Fred F.C. Martinez, whose 
murders sparked controversy 
in contrasting ways. Shepard 
was an openly gay college 
student in Wyoming who was 
kidnapped, robbed and beaten 
in 1998. He was tied to a fence 
and left to die in near-freezing 
temperatures. He succumbed 
to his injuries several days 
after the attack and quickly 
became a symbol in LGBTQ+ 
activists’ fight for acceptance 
and equality.
“Parents 
throughout 
the 

country felt that Matthew could 
have been their son, an idea 
many had never contemplated 
before 
of 
a 
gay 
person,” 
Krutzsch said. “Instead of 
describing him as an adult man 
who had boyfriends or lovers, 
he becomes a kid within the 
American nuclear family.” 
Krutzsch said the public 
connected to Shepard’s story, 
citing 
several 
journalists 
who wrote about the murder 
and how it sparked national 
response. 
“We have this Christian 
rhetoric that he is continuing 
to lead and teach others after 
he dies and in doing that, 
Shepard transforms into an 
image of gay men completely 

disassociated from public sex,” 
Krutzsch said. 
Martinez, 
who 
was 
murdered in Colorado in 2001, 
was “nádleehí,” a Navajo word 
used for a man with feminine 
attributes. 18-year-old Shaun 
Murphy 
beat 
16-year-old 
Martinez to death with a 
rock, and received a 40-year 
sentence 
for 
the 
crime. 
Murphy was paroled in 2019 
after serving 17 years in prison.
Krutzsch 
said 
because 
Martinez was a person of 
color, 
his 
murder 
carried 
a 
significantly 
different 
narrative than Shepard’s. 

“We 
have 
witnessed 
a 
national 
student 
movement 
for 
the 
growth 
of 
A/PIA 
Studies, but at the same time, 
we have watched a national 
struggle for A/PIA Studies to 
be institutionally supported 
by universities,” the letter 
said. “This University is no 
exception.”
The requirements outlined 
by the students include the 
creation of an A/PIA Studies 
major, 
more 
recognition 
and support for the faculty 
of ethnic studies programs, 
more spaces to hold lectures, 
additional faculty specifically 
dedicated to the ethnic studies 
program and meetings with 
LSA Dean Anne Curzan.
“The 
students 
of 
A/PIA 

Studies 
have 
witnessed 
a 
litigation 
in 
which 
the 
University that we chose to 
attend has excluded our role 
models, directly discredited 
our 
presence, 
and 
denied 
the existence of our lived 
realities,” the letter said. “We 
now need a period to heal and 
move forward from such an 
alienating process.”
As 
of 
Wednesday 
night, 
the letter had more than 100 
signatures from the A/PIA 
Studies community as well as 
other University students. 
In an interview with The 
Daily last week, University 
President Mark Schlissel said 
he was glad the University won 
the trial.
“We’re 
gratified 
they 
agreed 
with 
us,” 
Schlissel 
said. “As always with juries, 
it was a relatively lengthy 
and 
complicated 
trial. 
… 

We’re always trying to hear 
constructive 
criticism, 
even if we disagree with its 
conclusions.”
Schlissel 
said 
he’s 
spent 
time with A/PIA leadership 
to 
continue 
the 
ongoing 
conversation on how to improve 
the situation for the programs. 
“I would find it disappointing 
if any student felt as if they 
weren’t 
supported 
for 
any 
reason, any mode of identity,” 
Shlissel said. “Our student 
affairs staff and the folks that 
work on our multiculturalism 
programs are in contact with 
A/PIA and other groups. I’ve 
had A/PIA leadership to the 
house for breakfast, probably 
once a semester the last several 
years, and it’s an ongoing 
dialogue.”
In response to this statement, 
James Lee, LSA senior and A/
PIA Studies minor, said he felt 

offended by Schlissel’s mention 
of the entire A/PIA community 
being represented by a small 
group of leadership.
“When Schlissel says ‘A/PIA’ 
generally, that is completely 
antithetical to diversity,” Lee 
said. “Because if you’re going to 
say, ‘I listened to A/PIA,’ that’s 
15 percent of the student body. 
Who are you listening to? If you 
want to say something about 
diversity but then at the same 
time say the entirety of A/PIA 
is just a monolith and that you 
listen to everybody out there, 
when we’ve had experiences 
when 
we 
know 
you 
don’t 
(listen to us). You can have all 
this discourse about diversity, 
but that doesn’t matter when 
you’re doing nothing (to make 
improvements).”

Brian Wright, the father 
of a student targeted by 
the racist comments in a 
Snapchat 
group, 
noted, 
“That’s indicative of what 
these kids are experiencing.” 
Iraola is a Saline resident 
and owner of the popular 
Ann 
Arbor 
Mexican 
restaurant 
Chela’s. 
He 

immigrated 
to 
the 
U.S. 
from Mexico City in the 
1980s. The video recorded 
at the meeting shows Iraola 
responding 
to 
Burtell’s 
comment 
and 
explaining 
why he moved to the U.S. 
“He asked me a question, 
why didn’t I stay in Mexico?” 
Iraola said. “Because this is 
the greatest country in the 
world.” 
LSA 
senior 
Liberty 
Woodside graduated from 
Saline High School in 2016. 

Woodside said when she 
first heard the news, she was 
in disbelief at the blatant 
nature of Burtell’s comment. 
“It’s 
shocking 
to 
hear 
people 
be 
so 
outwardly 
racist,” Woodside said. “I 
feel like subtle racism is 
something that I’m more 
commonly faced with in my 
classes and more commonly 
studying. Subtle racism is 
still in our system, but I was 
definitely surprised to hear 
people just be so outwardly 
racist.”
Woodside also commented 
on how the demographics of 
Saline may contribute to the 
culture of racism, such as 
that displayed in Burtell’s 
comment.
“I 
wasn’t 
surprised 
that people face racism in 
Saline,” 
Woodside 
said. 
“Everybody 
in 
Saline 
is 
mostly white. I didn’t really 
experience 
any 
of 
those 
hardships because I’m a 

white cis female, but I’m not 
surprised that this would 
happen because Saline is not 
diverse at all.” 
Adi Mannari, Engineering 
senior 
and 
Saline 
Area 
Schools alum, said he was 
not surprised upon hearing 
about the incident. 
“I’m not surprised that 
there are people who have 
those views,” Mannari said. 
“But I am disappointed that 
it revealed itself in the way 
that it did.”
Rackham 
student 
Guadalupe 
Madrigal 
commented on Iraola’s role 
as a business owner and 
how he contributes to Ann 
Arbor’s Latinx community. 
“Chela’s is one of the few 
Mexican 
restaurants 
in 
Ann Arbor,” Madrigal said. 
“It’s seen as a pillar and 
as a mini-home for a lot of 
Latinx people in the area, so 
I think that it makes it even 
more personal because it’s 

somebody who’s part of our 
community.” 
Madrigal is currently a 
graduate student instructor 
for a communications class 
about whiteness and the 
media. She emphasized the 
importance of conversations 
about 
race 
on 
the 
University’s campus. 
“The professor brought it 
up in class today and talked 
about it with the students,” 
Madrigal said. “I think (the 
fact that) there is a space in 
which we’re talking to our 
students, our undergraduate 
students, it’s important.” 
Scot 
Graden, 
superintendent 
of 
Saline 
Area 
Schools, 
released 
a 
statement 
on 
Tuesday 
denouncing 
the 
recent 
instances of racism in the 
school 
district. 
He 
also 
commented 
on 
how 
the 
district will respond and 
continue working on the 
problem in the future. 

“The 
Saline 
Board 
of 
Education 
and 
administration 
take 
the 
issue 
of 
student 
and 
adult behavior seriously,” 
Graden 
said. 
“We 
are 
striving 
to 
ensure 
a 
welcoming, 
inclusive 
and 
safe environment for all 
students 
and 
families, 
regardless of their race, 
ethnicity, 
socioeconomic 
status, gender identity or 
any 
other 
identity. 
This 
is an opportunity for us 
— the staff, students and 
community of Saline Area 
Schools 
— 
to 
stand 
for 
anti-racism, 
respect 
and 
inclusion of all students.” 
Following the meeting, 
Saline 
residents 
held 
a 
Diversity 
and 
Inclusion 
rally 
on 
Wednesday 
night. 
More 
than 
100 
community 
members 
attended, marching through 
downtown 
Saline 
and 
calling out bigotry.

Personal travel to China is 
also discouraged.” 
As a result of the outbreak and 
ensuing travel restrictions, many 
students said they are struggling 
to adjust their study abroad plans. 
LSA freshman Erik Reyna was 
also planning on doing a summer 
abroad program in Shanghai 
and was recently informed via 
an email from CGIS that it’s still 
unclear whether or not these 
programs will be canceled.
“I wanted to study abroad in 
Shanghai but then the University 
sent me an email saying that the 
University put a travel restriction 
on China,” Reyna said. “So 
undergraduates like me aren’t 
able to go, and they say that if 
they don’t lift the ban before 
March 1 then they’ll just cancel 
all China programs.” 
The email was sent out last 
Tuesday from Rachel Reuter, 
CGIS international health and 
safety adviser, and explains the 
travel situation to students that 
had an open spring/summer or 
fall application for a program in 
China. 
“At this time we do not know 
if U-M spring/summer programs 
in China will be affected by the 
travel restriction. If you are still 
interested in studying abroad in 
spring/summer or fall, you have 
several options,” Reuter wrote. 
“If China is the only program 
you are interested in, then 
you should still complete your 
CGIS application as normal by 
February 1st. CGIS will review 
your application and wait to 
see how the situation unfolds 
in China. If the restriction has 
not been lifted by March 1st, 
then we will cancel the program 
altogether.”
The email also suggested that 
students fill out applications 
for other CGIS programs or 
withdraw their China application 
and wait to attend in 2021. 
Reyna said he thinks the 
decision to set a deadline for 
programs more than a month 
before 
they 
begin 
may 
be 
preemptive.
“Right now, it’s probably too 
early to decide because there’s 
still a possibility that they’ll 
lift their travel restrictions if 
the whole virus gets better,” 
Reyna said. “I feel like March is 
too early to say ‘Hey, you can’t 
do this’ ... the University says 
they don’t know about summer 
programs, but then again they 

kind of do because they already 
put a deadline on it.”
Business 
senior 
Kirtana 
Choragudi 
also 
planned 
on 
studying abroad in China this 
May through a program in the 
Ross School of Business. She said 
she was informed recently about 
the program’s cancellation. 
“Most of the work would have 
been done in China,” Choragudi 
said. “I was looking forward to 
learning the content of the class, 
which is corporate strategy in 
China.”
Choragudi said other students 
enrolled in the course this 
semester were also informed of 
the program’s cancellation right 
before the add/drop deadline. 
“They emailed me I think the 
day of the add/drop deadline or 
maybe the night before because 
that’s when U of M released 
that there was an official ban,” 
Choragudi said. “Essentially they 
said that the trip was canceled 
due to the U of M undergraduate 
travel ban to China and that they 
would look at alternate options if 
we wanted to keep the course on 
our transcript.”
According 
to 
Choragudi, 
the late confirmation made it 
difficult to adjust schedules.
“There hadn’t really been any 
communication from the office 
before then, even though we’d 
all been wondering obviously,” 
Choragudi said. “Since it was 
the day of the add/drop deadline, 
there weren’t any full semester 
three-credit classes I could add 
because it’s already pretty late 
into the semester.” 
Mary 
Gallagher, 
professor 
and director of the Center for 
Chinese Studies, discussed the 
travel restrictions and health 
concerns. She said she expects 
study 
abroad 
programs 
to 
continue to be canceled until the 
public health emergency is under 
control.
“I would imagine that that will 
happen throughout the winter 
and spring semesters, that travel 
to China will be questionable,” 
Gallagher said. “It could go 
into the summer in which case 
summer programs would be 
canceled.”
Gallagher said while it may 
cause inconvenience, limiting 
travel to China as much as 
possible for the safety of the 
general public and monitoring 
potential incoming cases is the 
best thing to do.

“It’s so cool to see people 
like 
Bernie 
Sanders 
and 
AOC and Rashida Tlaib and 
Ilhan Omar, and what kind 
of leaders they can be when 
they’re 
just 
unapologetic 
champions 
for 
what 
the 
people need. And they don’t 
need to get their permission 
slip 
signed 
from 
their 
corporate donors before they 
can make any statement.” 
In the corner of the cafe 
checking 
in 
volunteers 
was 
LSA 
freshman 
Gina 
Liu, 
the 
campaign’s 
campus coordinator for the 
University of Michigan. As 
more students filed into the 
cafe, Rajput began greeting 
them personally. He aims to 
not only campaign on a strong 
ideological platform but to 
rely on passionate grassroots 
volunteers while doing so.
“His 
experience 
is 
grassroots and his experience 
aligns with a lot of the 
constituents in this district 
and the young people in this 
district,” Liu said. “Seeing 
someone 
who 
actually 
is 
willing to fight the issues and 
also just not accept corporate 
money, that’s inspiring to 
me.”
Rajput’s 
platform 
is 
built on key policy pillars, 
including 
aggressively 
fighting climate change and 
rejecting 
corporate 
PAC 
money. He believes Congress 
needs to pass a Green New 
Deal. 
Since 
District 
12 
has 
six colleges and a large 
student population, Rajput 
also believes it’s necessary 
to make college free and 
eliminate student debt. He 
argues that Medicare for All 
and single-payer healthcare 
should not only be supported 
as an opportunistic political 
move, but as a steadfast 
Democratic ideal. 
“Part of the reason why I 
decided to run was because 
I was taking a look at how 
progressive 
our 
district 
actually 
is,” 
Rajput 
said. 
“Unfortunately, 
(Dingell’s) 
not the progressive champion 
that we need on these issues.”
As Rajput recounted his 
experiences 
canvassing, 
he claimed voters are not 
necessarily 
excited 
about 
having 
Dingell 
as 
their 
representative, but feel like 

she will always hold the seat. 
In these instances, Rajput 
makes his case a viable 
alternative. 
“There’s this perception 
that Rep. Dingell is beloved 
in the community or that 
she is very active,” Rajput 
said. “(But) when we go 
and 
talk 
to 
voters, 
it’s 
remarkable how infrequently 
Congresswoman 
Dingell’s 
name is brought up.”
However, because he is 
new to the political sphere, 
Rajput’s 
understanding 
of 
some of the issues important 
to voters in the district 
is less developed. One of 
the 
predominant 
issues 
in District 12 is the man-
made water crisis, where 
toxic PFAS chemicals have 
seeped 
into 
Michigan’s 
waters. These chemicals are 
linked to numerous health 
concerns, including cancer. 
Dingell 
co-authored 
the 
bipartisan PFAS Action Act, 
which passed the House of 
Representatives on Jan. 10. 
While Rajput noted the 
work that Dingell has done 
to combat PFAS, he said 
he believes she and the 
Democrats are only making 
incremental legislation and 
not considering the larger 
issue at hand — climate 
change. 
“Although we need to be 
focused on these more local 
environmental 
concerns, 
we can’t lose sight of the 
big picture,” Rajput said. 
“We can talk about this 
one chemical, or these few 
chemicals that are going to 
impact your health, but at 
the same time, are we putting 
blinders on when it comes to 
… the fact that our house is on 
fire when it comes to climate 
change?”
While Dingell has received 
criticism for not supporting 
the Green New Deal, she 
disagreed with the suggestion 
that 
local 
environmental 
concerns should be ignored 
and 
emphasized 
her 
record 
as 
a 
progressive 
congresswoman with a focus 
on environmental issues. In 
an interview with The Daily, 
Dingell said environmental 
groups such as Sierra Club and 
the League of Conservation 
Voters name her as one of the 
few representatives pushing 
for environmental bills every 
day. 
“If you call any of the 
environmental 
groups 
… 

they will tell you that I 
have introduced the leading 
legislation in the Congress 
that is called the 100% Clean 
Energy Bill, which follows 
the UN recommendation in 
achieving the 100 percent 
clean energy economy by 
2050,” Dingell said. “I am 
actually one of the only 
people getting bills through 
the Congress. So, I take great 
umbrage at his comment, to 
be perfectly frank.”
In 
November, 
three 
members 
of 
the 
Sunrise 
Movement held a sit-in protest 
at Dingell’s office in Ypsilanti 
where three were arrested. 
The 
young 
protestors 
demanded a meeting with the 
representative and urged her 
to sign on to the Green New 
Deal. 
Dingell added that while 
she hasn’t come out in support 
of the Green New Deal, she 
has 
spoken 
with 
several 
stakeholders, including the 
Sunrise Movement and the 
Labor Coalition, to come to 
a conclusion all constituents 
will agree on. 
“I 
met 
with 
Sunrise 
leadership 
and 
representatives, the Attorney 
General, 
Rashida 
(Tlaib) 
... 
We’ve 
been 
having 
conversations,” Dingell said. 
“I respect the work of those 
who are working on that.” 
Rajput 
also 
opposes 
“forever wars,” and in an 
interview 
with 
Michael 
Arria of progressive news 
site 
Mondoweiss, 
Rajput 
took issue with the fact that 
Dingell had never made a 
statement 
against 
going 
to war in Iran, and only 
spoke out against its having 
congressional 
approval. 
Dingell rebuked the criticism, 
saying that she was one of the 
first Democrats to speak out 
against war in Iran.
“He’s got a way of … not 
telling the truth,” Dingell 
said. “I was one of the very 
first on the floor of the House 
to speak out about what the 
President did.”
Dingell 
stands 
by 
her 
record, noting that she is 
the co-chair of the Medicare 
for 
All 
caucus 
and 
has 
always passionately fought 
for 
quality 
affordable 
health care. She said she 
has consistently fought for 
progressive legislation and 
is proud of her ability to 
pass bipartisan legislation in 
Congress. 

“I think that we gotta work 
with everybody, and (that) if 
you want to get a bill enacted 
that you’ve got to work across 
the aisle, because I know how 
to count votes,” Dingell said. 
“So if I can get a bill passed 
that will lower the cost of 
prescription 
drugs 
for 
a 
person in my district, that is 
a good bill. Then I’m going to 
work across the aisle … And 
that’s what I do. I put together 
friends across the aisle, and I 
try not to demonize people.“
Rajput said bipartisanship 
in this polarized era isn’t 
realistic. 
“So I understand when 
people are saying … have the 
Republicans and Democrats 
figure out a way to work 
together across the aisle,” 
Rajput said. “That appeals 
to my emotions, like how it 
appeals to many other people 
in this country. However, I 
do believe that at this point, 
bipartisanship is a myth.”
As Rajput and a campaign 
fellow, LSA sophomore Alec 
Schlotterback, parked outside 
a residential neighborhood, 
they put on their campaign 
embroidered knit hats and 
gloves to bear the snowstorm. 
They divvied up the houses 
and trudged through the 
neighborhood as the snow 
and winds thickened.
“Canvassing with him is a 
pretty interesting experience 
because people react to him 
a lot differently than they 
do with a volunteer like me,” 
Schlotterback said. “They’re 
much more willing to listen 
to him and to share the 
things they care about when 
they see the candidate face-
to-face as opposed to hearing 
about them from a volunteer. 
It’s also nice to know that 
he’s out there canvassing 
with us. It definitely helps me 
stay motivated knowing he’s 
out there knocking doors just 
like I am. Plus he’s got tons of 
energy and charisma and that 
really helps too.”
Rajput 
disappeared 
for 
a moment, having stepped 
inside of a house to talk to a 
constituent. While this action 
breaks traditional campaign 
protocol, he felt strongly 
about it. He said he spoke to 
a former Dingell supporter 
who left the conversation 
undecided.
“Knocking 
door-to-door, 
that’s how you change votes,” 
he said.

Organizers set up an altar 
of candles, surrounded by 
bags with various customized 
messages 
and 
flanked 
by 
several signs that contained 
messages 
and 
statistics 
about sexual assault at the 
University of Michigan from 
the 2019 Campus Climate 
Survey. 
One read “34.3% of Umich 
Undergraduate 
Women 
Experience Sexual Assault,” 
and another said that more 
than 5,000 women at the 
University have been sexually 
assaulted. 
Four 
students 
spoke 
in 
front of this altar about their 
experiences 
with 
and 
the 
stigmas attached to sexual 

assault.
One 
common 
sentiment 
was 
frustration 
with 
the 
University’s 
dealing 
with 
sexual 
assault. 
A 
speaker 
discussed 
the 
University’s 
policy that requires victims 
of 
sexual 
assault 
to 
face 
cross-examination on behalf 
of their accused perpetrator. 
The policy came after a 2018 
ruling from the Sixth Circuit 
Court mandating the change.
Another speaker said she 
“realized over a year ago that 
(she) couldn’t name more than 
5 friends” of hers who had 
not experienced some form of 
sexual assault. 
Anil Bansal, Engineering 
senior 
and 
co-founder 
of 
SAVA, clarified that sexual 
assault is not only a problem 
that affects women.
“Even though a lot of people 
think that this is just an issue 

for women, it’s not … A lot of 
my best friends have been 
sexually assaulted and it’s 
hard on me to see that … and 
realize that there’s not much 
that I can do about it,” Bansal 
said.
Jessica, 
a 
prospective 
University transfer student 
from Henry Ford Community 
College, spoke at the event. In 
an interview with The Daily, 
she discussed the emotional 
impact of her speech.
“I’m 
happy 
that 
people 
ended up staying around (in 
the bad weather),” Jessica 
said. “The first thing that 
Anil said to me after I read my 
speech was that I made him 
cry. That was the first time 
that I had given my speech to 
anybody.”
Candice emphasized that 
they were planning on holding 
more 
events 
in 
warmer 

weather, specifically one in 
the summer. Candice then 
gave advice to anyone who 
feels the urge to help victims 
of sexual assault.
“I want people to know that 
if you’re a person who hasn’t 
experienced sexual assault or 
sexual violence, but you want 
to be an ally, the best thing 
you can do is be a friend,” 
Candice said. “Even saying 
something as simple as like, 
‘Hey, I went to a vigil, or I read 
this article and it was really 
interesting.’ You can start 
that conversation even if you 
haven’t had the experience. 
People will open up to you 
and people will come to you. 
You will make them feel less 
alone.”

A sweet tooth’s worst nightmare

C

an sugar make you 
dumb? I wish I would 
have thought about 
this question before studying 
for my last chemistry exam. 
It was around 9 p.m., and I 
was in the newly-remodeled 
LSA 
building 
on 
campus. 
It was getting to that point 
in the night when you keep 
re-reading the same problem 
over and over again and seem 
to retain nothing. I needed 
something to wake me up. I 
decided to check out the self-
service cafe in the lobby for a 
study snack to get me through 
the next practice exam. I 
was torn between Sour Patch 
Kids and dried apple chips. 
Faithfully, I chose the Sour 
Patch Kids since they had 
succeeded in giving me that 
late-night sugar boost in the 
past.
The brain uses sugar in the 
form of glucose as its main 
food source. When you have 
low blood sugar, your brain 
loses its energy to function. I 
knew my brain needed some 
food, but was I overdosing on 
sugar by choosing the Sour 
Patch Kids? 
According to the American 
Heart 
Association, 
the 
maximum daily sugar intake 
for men is 36 grams and for 
women is 25 grams. We are 
all overdosing on sugar. The 
2 tablespoons of Nutella that 
you spread on your toast this 
morning contained 21 grams 
of sugar in it; for females, that 
is 84 percent of your daily 
sugar intake already wasted 
on one piece of toast. 
According 
to 
research 
performed 
by 
Fernando 
Gomez-Pinilla, a professor 
of neurosurgery at the David 
Geffen School of Medicine 
at UCLA, a long-term high-
fructose 
diet 
affects 
the 
brain’s ability to learn and 
remember 
information. 

Gomez-Pinilla studied how a 
variety of genes in the brain 
can be damaged by fructose. 
In Gomez-Pinilla’s study, 
rats were trained to escape 
from a maze and then divided 
into three groups. The first 
group drank fructose and 
had no Docosahexaenoic acid 
(DHA) in their diet. DHA is a 
type of omega-3 fatty acid that 
is essential in the brain. The 
second group drank fructose 
water and was fed a DHA-rich 
diet. The third group drank 
non-fructose water and had 
no DHA-rich diet. 

When the rats were put 
through 
the 
maze 
again, 
the rats that drank fructose 
water 
with 
no 
DHA-rich 
diet took twice as long to 
complete the maze compared 
to the rats from the other two 
groups. The memory of these 
rats was clearly impaired by 
the fructose in their diet and 
lack of DHA; it seems that 
fructose 
could 
lessen 
the 
effects of DHA. 
Another research study on 
sugar performed at Aarhus 
University in Denmark found 
that sugar intake can alter the 
reward-processing circuitry 
of the brain in a way similar 
to addictive drugs. After just 
12 days of sugar intake, the 
dopamine and opioid systems 

in the brain change. The 
sugar craving becomes more 
like an addiction, making it 
hard to replace that late-night 
sugary snack with something 
nutritious. We are directed 
by our brains to seek pleasure 
and avoid pain, whether that 
be the pain of withdrawal 
or the aftertaste of collard 
greens. It can be difficult to 
resist sugar especially when 
it is all around you — from 
donut sales in Mason Hall 
to jungle juice at parties to 
chocolate chip cookies at 
Mosher-Jordan 
Residence 
Hall’s dining hall. 
So where do we go from 
here? The first option is 
substitution. We all get that 
sweet tooth every once in a 
while, but how we choose 
to satisfy the sugar craving 
makes 
all 
the 
difference. 
Instead of grabbing candy, 
try a piece of fruit. This way 
you can still get your sugar 
fix, but without overdosing 
on added sugars. Another 
option is incorporating more 
DHA-rich foods into your 
diet. These include walnuts, 
salmon, edamame and kidney 
beans. A diet rich in DHA 
can counteract the sugar, 
increasing 
learning 
and 
memory by strengthening the 
synapses within the brain. 
For the risk-takers, another 
option is to challenge yourself 
to a sugar detox.
Sure, 
sugar 
overdosing 
probably 
does 
not 
fully 
account for failing an exam, 
but I do think there is enough 
evidence to convince me to 
put down the Sour Patch 
Kids and reach for a healthier 
alternative next time I’m 
struggling to keep my brain 
working through a practice 
exam late at night.

SHAD JEFFREY II | COLUMN

What music will define the 2010s?
W

hen I was younger, 
I used to listen to 
music from different 
decades with family members 
based on what they grew up 
listening to. The 1950s and ’60s 
with my grandparents, the 1970s 
and ’80s with my parents, the 
1990s and 2000s with my older 
sister. It was easy for me to 
separate music chronologically, 
based on the sounds I heard 
alone — my ear had been 
trained to differentiate the hard 
feedback of the Rolling Stones’ 
recordings from the soft vocals 
of The Eagles, and the upbeat 
rhythm of ’80s pop from ’90s 
grunge. 
With a few more years behind 
me, 
I’ve 
given 
more 
focus 
toward genres of music rather 
than simply categorizing music 
chronologically. 
In 
today’s 
generation of young people, 
with wide access to music 
streaming services like Spotify, 
Apple Music, SoundCloud and 
YouTube, how do we put a label, 
a sound or a rhythm to the music 
of the 2010s?
Wide and instant access to 
music has deeply specialized 
the tastes of the generation 
who defined the culture of the 
2010s, who I will say range 
between the ages of 16 and 30 
presently, as they came of age 
during this decade and had 
the most influence on popular 
culture. 
We 
don’t 
have 
to 
choose between a handful of 
radio stations to define our 
personalities and tastes, we can 
explore and delve into any niche 
we can find. We’re no longer 
dependent on the radio disk-
jockey, American BandStand 
or 
Billboard 
for 
discovery. 
Ultimately, our music taste 
feels less united than in past 
generations. Taking a sampling 
of the most popular songs from 
the last decade is interesting 
because the sound doesn’t feel 
quite as homogenous as it does 
when you look back at a decade 

like the 1960s or ’70s. While 
different genres were consumed 
by different people then as they 
are now, it seems the effects 
of technology on culture and 
music have led us to extreme 
specification, and — in some 
ways — polarization. 
The range of songs that 
defined this period are as 
diverse as they come, from 
“Levels” 
to 
“Despacito” 
to 
“Uptown 
Funk.” 
Reviewing 
the list of songs that Billboard 
published that “defined the 
decade” is fascinating, with 
so many genres and different 
sounds represented, a future 
and hypothetical “Best of the 
2010s” radio station could never 
exist. An “oldies” station for my 
generation would have to be so 
widely encompassing that, in an 
attempt to appeal to everyone, it 
might fail to attract anyone. The 
diversity of this generation’s 
tastes could never be bottled 
into a radio station, and in fact, 
most of us don’t listen to the 
radio anymore at all.

The increased use of the 
auxiliary cord and Bluetooth 
technology, 
coupled 
with 
the rise of smartphones and 
streaming services, has allowed 
people to control their own 
vibes in a way that radio or 
mix-CDs never could. Each 
song and each rhythm is in the 
power of the listener and that 
has 
fundamentally 
changed 
how we enjoy music collectively. 
With so much more to choose 

from, we aren’t categorized by 
one genre or sound from the 
past 10 years, there isn’t one 
popular or mainstream sound 
to base counterculture and 
“countermusic” off of anymore.
There are many arguments 
as to how streaming services 
negatively 
impact 
artists 
and put less money in their 
pockets. 
On 
the 
opposite 
side of the spectrum, it has 
become significantly easier and 
cheaper for artists, especially 
new artists, to release music, 
market themselves and reach 
a niche with the current music 
streaming 
and 
consumption 
infrastructure. 
Spotify 
and 
SoundCloud allow you to upload 
your music for free and receive 
money based on listens, which 
represents a sort of “bottom-up” 
approach to the music industry 
where 
new 
and 
relatively 
unknown 
artists 
aren’t 
dependent on major labels or 
high-budget studio albums to 
see a payday.
It seems we are less united 
by a common music taste than 
in generations past — but this 
shared experience of growing 
up 
with 
and 
embracing 
technology has separated our 
human experience from those 
that came before us, and has 
created a new shared identity 
of experiencing life and culture 
in a way that it never has been 
before. Our generation has 
pioneered the full integration 
of life and tech, and it will 
be extremely interesting to 
see how we are observed and 
studied by future generations. 
The variety of music that has 
defined the 2010s won’t be able 
to be encompassed by a “Best 
of the 19-XXs” radio station, 
but that doesn’t mean we won’t 
remember 
the 
meaningful 
tracks 
that 
defined 
our 
generation.

The American experience is not universal

N

ominated 
for 
six 
Oscars 
last 
week, 
“Parasite” 
became 
the 
first 
Korean 
movie 
to be nominated for Best 
International 
Film. 
This 
reminded the public of an 
interview the director Bong 
Joon-ho had last October, 
in which he said he was not 
expecting much from the 
Oscars. It may have just been 
his humility, but it’s likely his 
pessimism was based on the 
fact that a Korean film has 
never been nominated for the 
award. However, it was his 
next comment that surprised 
many American critics. “It’s 
a little strange, but it’s not a 
big deal. The Oscars are not 
an international film festival. 
They’re very local,” Joon-
ho said. He shocked many 
Americans by categorizing 
the Oscars, long perceived as 
one of the most prestigious 
film gatherings in the world, 
as a local event. It is, in fact, 
a local event. The Oscars only 
recognize movies “for paid 
admission in a commercial 
motion picture theater in Los 
Angeles County.” I’m not a 
film expert, but the reason 
I’m introducing this news 
byte is to point out that some 
Americans often forget that 
“American” does not mean 
“universal.”
As an international student 
born and raised in South 
Korea, it’s often shocking 
to see how some American 
people perceive the world. 
In 
courses 
that 
address 
United 
States 
government 
and 
politics, 
instructors 
will 
sometimes 
refer 
to 
background 
knowledge 
by 
asking students to think about 
what they learned about the 

Civil War in high school or 
the American values they 
were taught growing up. They 
were not cognizant of the fact 
that there were international 
students in the class, people 
who were unfamiliar with 
these 
common 
American 
teachings. These instances 
reflect how some Americans, 
even those who are well-
educated, are indifferent to 
or even unaware of the rest 
of the world. While American 
universities may claim to be 
global centers of knowledge, 
Joon-ho describes them as 
“insulated worlds” detached 
from other cultures.

Although, 
it 
is 
natural 
for anyone to feel attached 
to 
their 
country, 
I 
find 
America’s 
indifference 
toward 
foreign 
cultures 
extraordinary 
because 
it 
starkly contrasts what I was 
taught about the world. The 
Korean mandatory education 
system teaches every student 
Korean, English and a choice 
of a second foreign language. 
Under the equivalent of K-12, 
each student is required to 
learn English from third grade 
and an additional foreign 
language from eighth grade, 
and the Korean SAT tests all 
three languages. This is not 

about excessive education, 
but rather about recognizing 
that not everyone speaks one 
language, and it is important 
to learn how to communicate 
with people from different 
countries.
Meanwhile, 
minorities 
in 
the U.S. are still mocked for 
speaking languages other than 
English in public. An online 
critic responded to this with 
a burning satire, saying, “ ‘It’s 
rude not speaking English in 
public places.’ Aw, does it remind 
you that you can only speak 
one 
language?” 
Observing, 
or even experiencing, such 
incidents makes one realize 
how provincial perspectives 
are responsible for exclusive 
society.
Compared to “international 
student,” 
imagine 
how 
awkward “domestic student” 
sounds. American students 
in an American institution 
are domestic students, but 
to 
an 
American 
listener, 
that 
way 
of 
categorizing 
might sound strange because 
“American” has always been the 
default. Every time I walk on 
the Diag and see the American 
flag, I feel ambivalent. On one 
hand, it reminds me of the 
rich democratic history I 
learn about every day, and 
I understand why so many 
people 
are 
patriotic 
to 
this country. On the other 
hand, I wish that someday 
studying in the U.S., I no 
longer need to come up with 
a random Hollywood movie 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
my 
actual 
favorite 
movie 
for 
an icebreaker, which is not 
American.

Each song and 
each rhythm is in

Frances Quinlan tackles the unpleasant on ‘Likewise’

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

I don’t usually listen to indie 
rock, but when I do, it’s for a 
good reason. This time around, 
the reason is Frances Quinlan. 
The Hop Along frontwoman has 
decided to grace the world with 
her debut solo album Likewise. I 
don’t know much about indie rock, 
I admit. However, I do know what 
makes an outstanding album, and 
this is an outstanding album. 
Sonically, 
Likewise 
is 
a 
gorgeous nine-song romp through 
a 
glistening 
and 
glittering 
indie rock wonderland. Album 
opener “Pilitdown Man” takes 
a stroll down a piano-driven 
lane as Quinlan sings softly in 
a pleasingly off-kilter manner. 
“Rare Thing” is a hypnotic spiral 
staircase up to synth-pop heaven. 
“Went to LA” is a twinkling 
acoustic gaze up toward the stars 

marked by Quinlan’s ever-present 
ruminations on anything and 
everything. As a whole, Likewise 
is a sonic tour of Quinlan’s world, 
a world for everyone, filled with 
pleasant little quirks and easter 
eggs.
Lyrically, however, Likewise is 
something of an oasis. Quinlan is 
floating by herself, accompanied 
only by her own thoughts and 
musings. 
She 
covers 
themes 
ranging from climate change, 
human compassion, solitude and 
even cannibalism. Despite this 
range, Quinlan is always laser-
focused, dissecting each topic 
with the precision and ease of a 
surgeon. This description makes 
it seem like Likewise is a sterile 
operating room, but it certainly is 
not. Rather, it is a messy, scattered 
album similar to the natural 
world, which Quinlan wrangles 
with grace and poise, deftly 
handling everything that crosses 

her mind.
“Detroit Lake” finds Quinlan 
striking 
the 
perfect 
balance 
between sonic beauty and lyrical 
dismay. She takes listeners to 
a 
conversation 
between 
the 
narrator and another person, far 
away from the namesake lake. 
In the song’s chorus, she sings, 
“Miles from all that’s between 
us at stake / Algae blooms up in 
Detroit Lake / Listening for my 
turn to come next / Leave, the 
same as I came in, more or less.” 
Quinlan describes a conversation 
running dry, perhaps the sign of 
a dying relationship, which, at 
the time, seems more important 
than the algal bloom in the 
distant Detroit Lake. “Detroit 
Lake” serves as a reminder 
that our actions can have grave 
consequences, yet we still are 
more concerned about ourselves, 
a message that rings true across 
the album.

Likewise is a thoughtful album 
that is chock-full of compelling 
lyrics and ideas, but for some 
reason, Quinlan decides to end it 
with words that are not her own. 
Album closer “Carry the Zero” is 
a cover of the Built to Spill song 
of the same name, and despite 
its status as a cover, it’s so much 
more. In a personal album filled 
with her thoughts and feelings, it 
makes sense that Quinlan chose 
to include a cover of one of her 
favorite songs. She stays true to 
the essence of the song, but she 
makes it wholly her own. She 
makes it more subdued than the 
original, driven by an echoing 
synth line that, in true Quinlan 
fashion, eventually explodes into 
a full band, including blazing 
guitar licks and a pulsating bass 
line. All the focus is on her as 
she perfectly and thoughtfully 
delivers each line, closing her 
album beautifully.

Likewise finds Frances Quinlan 
tackling some pretty complex 
themes, but she delivers them in a 
relatable, down-to-earth manner, 
thanks to her charming persona 

and 
gorgeous 
instrumentals. 
Quinlan is sure to make a fan 
out of anyone with Likewise. She 
certainly just made one out of me.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

Musical theatre tends to be 
dominated by whiteness. White 
characters breed white casting 
and white schooling in a positive 
feedback loop that has excluded 
artists of color for as long as the 
industry is old. 
The University’s School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance students 
know this — they live it. On a recent 
rainy 
evening, 
SMTD Junior 
Erica Ito put it this way: “[it’s] a 
predominantly white department 
in 
a 
predominantly 
white 
institution in a predominantly 
white field that we are entering 
that has a complicated history 
with people of color.” 
“The Color Cabaret” deals with 
all of this. Divided into two parts 
over roughly 90 minutes, the 
student-run show gives artists of 
color opportunities to sing and 
perform in roles rarely offered to 
them. In the first half, students 
take on famous color-consciously 
casted songs that make a difference 
to 
them 
as 
artists. 
Disney 
princesses and “Hadestown” are 
both set to make an appearance. 
The second half takes on iconic 
roles in musical theatre that have 
not been traditionally performed 
by people of color — “Don’t Rain 
on My Parade” from “Funny Girl” 
and “Music in the Mirror” from 
“A Chorus Line” topped Ito’s list 
of what to look forward to. The 
last few numbers will also tackle 
issues of intersectionality. 

Ito, who is co-producing the 
show alongside SMTD junior 
Thani Brant, started work on 
the cabaret with a few other MT 
upperclassmen back in November. 
The show has been an on-and-
off biennial tradition for the past 
decade, but Ito and her team have 
revamped it into something extra 
special for 2020. 
The 
concept 
started 
in 
conversation 
— 
specifically, 
intergroup dialogues facilitated by 
director and SMTD senior Maya 
Imani. There, everyone involved 
had the chance to voice their 
experiences as performers of color.
“These are conversations that 
we have with our roommates 
at 2 a.m. or coming home from 
rehearsal,” Imani said.
She added that bringing such 
topics into a formalized space 
made people feel “like their 
thoughts and opinions about these 
things actually do have worth.” 
Imani and Ito both noted how 
special these dialogues quickly 
became, 
especially 
in 
their 
accentuation of every individual’s 
experience. Both women were 
pleasantly surprised by how much 
they could still learn from each 
other. 
Therein lies the theme of 
the show, too. It’s “sharing our 
experiences with each other,” Ito 
said, “and then pushing that into 
the audience.”
Later 
that 
evening, 
Imani 
echoed 
this 
exact 
sentiment. 
“The cabaret is not about making 
a political statement,” she said. 
The performers are there to listen, 

support, validate and celebrate one 
another — the audience just gets to 
watch. 
And while the show has been an 
undertaking for its upperclassmen 
leadership, the impact is not lost 
on MT underclassmen of color, 
either. In fact, these dialogues 
were the first time the freshmen 
had ever been in a room with only 
people of color.
“That sheer fact,” Imani said, 
reminded her of “how much the 
space, and who’s present in the 
space, can dictate what you allow 
yourself to bring out … How does 
being in a predominantly white 
space affect your artistry?” 
The show might not offer 
an answer, but it celebrates 
the 
opportunity 
to 
ask 
the 
question. The weight of such an 
opportunity doesn’t go unnoticed 
by Ito or Imani. While they both 
spoke highly of their supportive 
department that works alongside 
“The Color Cabaret” rehearsals 
and schedule requirements, they 
made an important distinction: 
the faculty prepares their students 
for the musical theatre industry as 
it exists today. Ito and Imani are 
creating a show for the industry 
they’d like to remake for tomorrow. 
“The Color Cabaret” plays this 
weekend on Friday and Saturday 
at 7 p.m. in The Newman Studio 
of the Walgreen Drama Center. 
Admission is free. Following the 
show, the actors will facilitate a 
round-table discussion to continue 
the conversations on being an 
artist of color in musical theatre. 

BOOKS NOTEBOOK
On love triangles in fiction

Last week I was reminded of 
the horrific love-triangle trope 
in young-adult novels when my 
friend brought up the “Shatter 
Me” series in our book club. 
She was a touch too excited 
(morbidly so) to share the gory 
details: “...and here’s the kicker, 
Adam and Warner are the only 
people that are able to touch 
her. Like, of course, it’s the love 
interests that are the kryptonite 
to her ‘super-power.’” Tahereh 
Mafi’s “Shatter Me” follows 
Juliette, a teenage girl who has 
a “fatal touch.” That is, after 
Juliette touches someone, they 
die. At the start of the novel, 
she’s locked up in a cell and 
hasn’t 
experienced 
human 
touch in years… until Adam. 
“Shatter Me” screams “young-
adult dystopia” with the two 
male leads following the love-
triangle trope to a T. Adam, the 
nice one and Warner, the bad 
boy/villain/anti-hero. 
After 
six sequels, guess which one 
Juliette ends up with (cue the 
eye-roll and yawn). 
Even 
though 
I’ve 
never 
read “Shatter Me,” it feels like 
I have. The thought of love 
triangles triggers the sensation 
of cockroaches crawling under 
my 
skin. 
With 
a 
physical 
revolution, I’m yanked back in 
time to 5th grade, where I read 
about my first love triangle ever: 
“Twilight.” It’s true. I ate up the 
“Twilight” series like a vampire 

after a weekend-long fast from 
blood. I was unabashedly Team 
Edward, and I felt betrayed 
when Bella swayed to Jacob 
in “New Moon.” I wanted to 
wallow in a ball and shake Bella 
out of her werewolf induced 
spell, “Edward is the love of 
your life!” 
Take 
my 
aforementioned 
turbulent 
emotions 
and 
apply them to any of the 
following series: “The Mortal 
Instruments,” 
“The 
Infernal 
Devices” (Side note — this series 
has 
unequivocally 
deterred 
me from love triangles forever. 
Tessa, you can’t have your cake 
and eat it too!), “The Hunger 
Games,” “Vampire Academy,” 
“The Selection.” It’s always 
the mean playboy with the 
traumatic past versus the nice, 
bland guy, typically best friends 
with our protagonist. With 
few exceptions (cough, “The 
Hunger Games”), the nice guys 
finish last. 
Now we return to the age-
old question: If love triangles 
are so annoying, then why are 
they so popular? Certainly, my 
relationship 
with 
literature 
would be so much more stress-
free if not for the dreaded 
love-triangle. It’s an idea I’ve 
ruminated on quite extensively 
in my brief foray back into the 
young-adult literature world. 
Why introduce a new potential 
love interest when it’s (mostly) 
clear who the protagonist will 
end up with? Then it hit me 
— I wouldn’t be reading these 

stories in the first place if it 
weren’t for their love triangles 
(my 
masochist 
tendencies 
notwithstanding of course). 
Hear me out, these books 
can’t 
stand 
on 
their 
own 
without the love-triangle. The 
love-triangle serves to hide 
the nonexistent plot and one-
dimensional 
characters 
by 
upping the tension. If young-
adult novels were mysteries, 
the love triangles would be the 
equivalent of whodunit plot-
lines. The thing that’s driving 
the readers to finish X amount 
of sequels to these novels is 
the 
love-triangle. 
Imagine 
novels 
like 
“Shatter 
Me,” 
“The Selection” or “Twilight” 
without the love-triangle. It’s 
a stagnant, mushy book — the 
literary version of a pint of Ben 
& Jerry’s for breakfast, lunch 
and dinner. Where’s the flavor? 
It’s that elusive uncertainty of 
“will they or won’t they?” that 
motivates me to pick up the 1000 
page hardcover of “Breaking 
Dawn,” fully aware that I’m not 
cracking that mammoth of a 
book to resolve the conflict with 
the Volturi. 
Despite 
the 
irritation, 
I 
sometimes need the spice of a 
love triangle in my life. With 
my (let’s be honest) absent 
love life, the drama of two men 
and one girl is alluring. Even 
without a plot, I’m flooded with 
a whirlwind of emotions: anger, 
angst, butterflies and relief. 
Let’s face it, love triangles sell 
for a reason.

TV REVIEW
Ted Bundy doc empowers

Have you heard the name 
Karen Sparks? Nancy Wilcox? 
Kimberly Leach?
You probably haven’t. But 
I can guarantee you’ve heard 
the name Ted Bundy. You know 
who he is and who he pretended 
to be. Chances are, you know 
as much about what he did as 
you can stomach but very little 
about who he did it to. You may 
know it’s a much, much longer 
list of names than the ones 
aforementioned, but you don’t 
know all the names. Amazon 
Prime’s 
new 
documentary 
series “Ted Bundy: Falling for 
a Killer” wants to change that.
Anchored 
by 
interviews 
with 
Bundy’s 
longtime 
girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall, 
“Falling 
for 
a 
Killer” 
emphasizes the importance of 
a woman’s perspective on his 
crimes. The series begins with 
Kendall describing the blissful 
years leading up to Bundy’s 
infamous murder spree. Soon, 
the domestic tranquility of her 
family’s life is juxtaposed with 
the savage violence that came 
to define her seemingly perfect 
partner.
Joined by feminist scholars, 
relatives of Bundy’s victims, 
female 
law 
enforcement 
officers and a few survivors of 
his crimes, Kendall attempts 

to explain how Bundy was 
able to attack potentially over 
100 women within the span of 
four years. The series details 
how cultural and political 
movements influenced Bundy’s 
crimes and how the public 
understood them at the time. 
In 
the 
mid-1970s, 
the 
women’s liberation movement 
was in full swing, Roe v. 
Wade had recently secured 
women’s right to choose, and 
Republicans were scrambling 
to maintain control amidst 
Nixon’s 
disintegrating 
administration. Bundy, who 
previously aspired to study 
law and become a conservative 
politician, 
committed 
his 
murders 
at 
the 
height 
of 
the university protests and 
demonstrations 
calling 
for 
radical social change.
While 
the 
connection 
between cultural movements 
and a psychopathic murderer’s 
motives may be tenuous, the 
link between a systemically 
oppressive society and male 
violence against women is 
undeniable. Kendall and her 
daughter, whom Bundy helped 
raise, recount anecdotes of his 
constant need to control their 
wardrobe and social lives. His 
reputation in the media as a 
criminal mastermind leading 
a perfect double life falls 
apart when his colleagues and 
relatives are able to tell their 
own stories.

Capitalizing 
on 
tragedy 
and victims’ pain has become 
a characteristic of the true-
crime 
genre, 
particularly 
regarding 
the 
crimes 
of 
Ted Bundy. After countless 
documentaries 
and 
2019’s 
controversial film “Extremely 
Wicked, 
Shockingly 
Evil 
and Vile” starring Zac Efron 
(“Baywatch”) as the infamous 
killer, the story of Bundy’s 
crimes has been repeatedly 
rehashed 
with 
little 
new 
interpretation. “Ted Bundy: 
Falling for a Killer” provides 
a response to his version of 
events.
One woman interviewed in 
“Falling for a Killer” has never 
spoken out before. Known to 
the public by the pseudonym 
Joni Letz, Karen Sparks is 
Bundy’s first known victim 
and one of his few survivors. 
In showing her face and telling 
her story, this series seeks to 
show its audience what the 
point is in revisiting these 
events.
Rather 
than 
immortalize 
a 
manipulative 
rapist 
and 
murderer, “Falling for a Killer” 
opts 
to 
shift 
the 
public’s 
perspective on the topic and 
refocus the true-crime genre’s 
values. The show presents 
a group of women too often 
discounted as a list of names, 
rather 
than 
victims 
and 
survivors. You know his story. 
It’s time to learn theirs.

COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

Movies, musicals 
and ‘Mean Girls’

SAMMY SUSSMAN
Community Culture Columnist

“What could Tina Fey possibly 
hope to achieve in this next version 
of ‘Mean Girls?,’ I asked myself. I had 
just read the news of Fey’s newest 
venture: a movie, based on her 
musical, based on her earlier movie. 
Fey’s original “Mean Girls,” from 
2004, is a classic. Her quick, snappy 
dialogue and archetypical high 
school plotline is both easily relatable 
and surprisingly unmatched when it 
comes to high school based movies. 
It easily captured a generation of 
teenage popular culture.
With respect to cinematography, 
too, Fey traverses wide spans of 
chronology without losing focus. 
The movie begins with the main 
character Cady’s first day of school 
and ends with her last. It allows 
the viewer very little time to simply 
absorb a scene, to simply take stock.
I remember spending one of 
my summers at sleepaway camp 
obsessed with the film. We watched 
it on the bus and on movie nights. 
I remember a few of my friends 
repeating the dialogue from a few 
of the scenes over and over again, 
eventually learning it by heart.
We were in middle school at the 
time, and this exemplified what high 
school life would be like. It perfectly 
encapsulated the clique-based social 
groupings of high school, those 
based on (perceived) popularity and 
those on shared interest.
When Fey announced that she 
would be turning the movie into a 
musical, I was thus eager to see this 
new iteration of “Mean Girls.” I was 
able to get tickets to a show in June, 
2018, shortly after the show had 
opened in April of that year.
Before seeing the show, I decided 
to watch the movie again. And in 
doing so, I was surprised to learn 
how quickly much of the magic of 
it had aged. While some of the jokes 
were still incredibly funny, many 
were clearly past their prime.
The pace of the movie, too, 
had lost much of its appeal. We 
as viewers, after all, have become 

conditioned to jump cuts that 
relieve our attention. Few of us 
watch movies without glancing at 
our phones and then back at the 
screen. A plot that relies on this sort 
of chronological and geographical 
jumping is nowhere near as novel 
as it might have been in the pre-
smartphone era.
I also began to wonder if popular 
culture 
might 
have 
become 
oversaturated with “Mean Girls” 
references. The movie’s influence 
on popular culture had begun to 
overshadow its own content. 
Or perhaps popular culture 
had iconicized the movie as the 
height 
of 
early-2000’s 
teenage 
culture. Perhaps our ever-evolving, 
collective sense of humor had moved 
past the movie, idealizing it even as 
we continued to perfect upon it.
With all these things in mind, I 
was excited to see how Fey might 
have updated the story. She would 
be forced to change certain lines to 
fit the medium of a multi-act stage 
musical, I knew. But perhaps she 
could also take this opportunity to 
inject the story with new life and 
new humor.
At the show that I attended, the 
group of friends sitting beside me 
knew every movie-based joke by 
heart. Much to my initial annoyance, 
they repeated every line from the 
movie with the actors on stage — 
by the end of the show, I began to 
realize what a good barometer of 
new vs. old material this was.
A few of the new jokes were 
unexpected and timely. A reference 
to President Trump and his (then 
recently-discovered) dealings with 
Russians, for example, was a new 
moment of comic relief. So were 
the 
references 
to 
hypocritical, 
post-Trumpian “feminist” culture. 
(“This is modern feminism talking. 
I expect to run the world in shoes 
I cannot walk in,” one character 
sings.) 
Most of the show, however, felt 
predictable.

FILM REVIEWS: SUNDANCE
Activism hinders ‘The Dissident’

Who 
was 
Jamal 
Khashoggi, 
the 
Washington Post journalist whose Oct. 2, 
2018 disappearance at the Saudi Consulate in 
Turkey dominated headlines for weeks on end?
“The Dissident,” a documentary premiere 
at Sundance 2020, shows that Khashoggi was 
more than just a writer. He was a reformer, 
activist, friend, future husband and in the 
months leading to his death, a Saudi dissident. 
Interviews with several sources make for 
an engaging and all-encompassing image of 
Khashoggi from all angles. His fiancé Hatice 
Cengiz introduces Khashoggi the kind-
hearted man. His co-activist Omar Abdulaziz 
introduces Khashoggi the dissident. Cengiz, 
Abdulaziz and others close to Khashoggi reveal 
his loving, devoted nature and dedication to 
the human rights of the people of Saudi Arabia.
Following Khashoggi’s story from his time 
as a journalist in Saudi Arabia to his short-lived 
self-exile to the United States, it’s amazing 
that he lived as long as he did. For decades, 
Khashoggi thrived in a grey area in which 
he criticized the government yet remained 
a close friend of the royal family. He knew 
what red lines not to cross, but he pushed his 
journalism to the very edge of those lines. 
When the government began to crack down on 
the voice of any Saudi figure with an audience, 

Khashoggi fled to the United States.
The film demonstrates how Khashoggi 
came to be targeted by the Saudi government. 
He continued to criticize Saudi Arabia from 
the safety of the United States while writing for 
The Washington Post, fighting for free speech 
through the power of his words. Abdulaziz 
reveals the depth to which 
Khashoggi became involved in 
Saudi insurgency, even wiring 
thousands of dollars to fund 
Abdulaziz’s Twitter warfare 
against the Saudi government. 
It is through affiliation with 
his activism that Abdulaziz 
believes Khashoggi sealed his 
fate.
Khashoggi is not the only 
person 
whose 
portrait 
is 
painted in “The Dissident.” The 
filmmakers’ access to Turkish 
evidence and interviews with 
Turkish officials reveal the character of Saudi 
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also 
known as MBS. Turkish officials in charge 
of the case reveal the heartbreaking manner 
in which Khashoggi was murdered, and his 
corpse was disposed of. Incriminating evidence 
shows how strongly MBS is implicated in the 
murder. The documentary highlights the unity 
of American intelligence in the belief that MBS 
ordered the killing, something that speaks to 

the character of Donald Trump, who refuses 
to believe MBS was involved.
While compelling in its portrait of 
Khashoggi, “The Dissident” feels amateurish 
in its artistry. Its filmmaking is full of 
questionable choices. Imposing “glitchy” filters 
over all footage associated with Khashoggi’s 
murder. 
Overused 
footage 
of Omar Abdulaziz walking 
the streets of Montreal in a 
topcoat, looking like a loner. An 
obnoxious computer-generated 
battle between robotic bees and 
flies, meant to depict the cyber 
warfare between Saudi Arabia’s 
Twitter 
army 
and 
Omar 
Abdulaziz’s organized activists. 
It’s disappointing, especially 
considering the seriousness of 
the subject matter.
The narrative is overly reliant 
on Abdulaziz’s own activism, 
which is interesting, but given far too much 
screen time. If it had been traded for more 
discussion of the consequences of Khashoggi’s 
assassination on journalism, Saudi Arabia or 
the world at large, there would be much more 
to glean from the whole documentary.

“Once Upon 
a Time in 

Venezuela”

Dir. Anabel 
Rodriguez Rios

January 27, 2020 
Sundance 2020

‘Venezuela’ is resiliant storytelling

Anabel Rodriguez Ríos — director of 
“Once Upon a Time in Venezuela,” the first 
Venezuelan documentary to ever premiere at 
Sundance — is fairly certain her film will be 
censored by the Venezuelan government. But 
she’s willing to climb through hoops to get it 
the attention it deserves.
“Once Upon a Time in Venezuela” is the 
story of Congo Mirador, a once-thriving 
fishing village nestled on a tributary of lake 
Maracaibo. Lake Maracaibo is the largest 
lake in Venezuela and home to one of the 
largest oil reserves in the world. Ríos spent 
five years following families in Congo 
Mirador and documenting their struggles to 
save the sinking village they’ve inhabited for 
generations. When Ríos started filming, about 
400 people were proud to call Congo Mirador 
home. Today, only six remain.

Congo Mirador is strong and resilient 
in the face of constant neglect by the 
Venezuelan government on a local and 
national level. Residents are constantly 
being displaced because of 
increased 
sedimentation 
spurred by climate change. 
Many live without basic needs 
and 
sanitation, 
and 
some 
are turning to the tourist 
market to sell goods. While 
the film was still in the works, 
representatives 
of 
Congo 
Mirador 
were 
determined 
to make a change. Today, 
that hope seems to have 
disappeared: Congo Mirador 
has fallen into the same cycle 
of neglect as other Venezuelan 
communities.
“[This film] comes from this feeling of 
de-rooting that we have had as a whole 
society, as Venezuelans,” said Ríos as I caught 

up with her after the screening. “If we artists 
don’t tell the story, it’s as if we (Venezuelans) 
don’t exist. It comes to a point where one has 
to tell it or die.”
Ríos 
is 
determined 
to 
tell Congo Mirador’s story 
authentically. She spent years 
convincing the village to let her 
film, waiting as long as three 
years to shoot Tamara, the local 
representative of the village. 
Camera shots are rarely rapid, 
instead lingering on the faces 
of citizens, capturing their 
concern for their families and 
community.
“They 
wanted 
to 
communicate that it was an 
existential, desperate situation. 
They saw the film as a tool,” Ríos said.

With healthy legs and new faces, Michigan looks to build on success in 2020

After a season riddled with 
injuries, faceoff struggles and 
deflating, 
tightly-contested 
losses, 
many 
teams 
would 
simply throw in the towel 
toward the end of the season, 
deeming 
their 
final 
games 
meaningless. 
The 
Michigan 
men’s lacrosse team could’ve 
been one of those teams.
But 
the 
Wolverines 
still 
needed to play Ohio State to end 
their 2019 campaign. Despite 
its 3-9 record at the time, 
Michigan wasn’t going to hand 
the Buckeyes a win.
Eager 
to 
send 
departing 
seniors like Brent Noseworthy, 
Decker 
Curran 
and 
Nick 
DeCaprio out on a high note, 
Michigan came out hot. At 
halftime, the Wolverines found 
themselves up 8-4 against Ohio 
State, 30 minutes away from 
knocking 
the 
Buckeyes 
out 
of contention for the Big Ten 
Tournament and ruining their 
postseason hopes.
Thirty minutes away from 
the program’s first win over 
their rival in history.
“We knew we were close to 
turning the corner,” Michigan 
coach Kevin Conry said. “The 
season as a whole was a season 
of reinventing ourselves based 
on our situation ... We had to 
consistently change who we 
needed to be. And by the end of 
the year, we had finally found 
that identity.”
So Michigan kept its foot on 
the gas pedal. For his final time, 
Noseworthy led the Wolverines 
on an offensive charge, notching 
three 
goals 
throughout 
the 
second half to keep the lead out 
of Ohio State’s reach.
As the final seconds ticked 
down on the clock, Michigan 
stood tall to defeat the Buckeyes, 
13-10.
The locker room celebration 
ensued. 
Director of Operations Joe 
Hennessey made his way down 
to Conry and congratulated him. 
The pair shared a sigh of relief 
and embraced what was a hard-
fought, deserved win to end a 
season that tested the bounds 

of the program’s resilience and 
patience.
Beyond the satisfaction of 
playing spoiler to the Buckeyes, 
Michigan’s victory over Ohio 
State was monumental for the 
program. While the Wolverines’ 
eighth season as a Division I 
lacrosse program was not all 
they hoped it would be, their 
finale demonstrated the team’s 
true potential and gave the 
program a wave of confidence 
going into the upcoming season. 
“It really sprung us forward,” 
Conry said. “That was a great 
taste of what we could be, but 
(now) we know how to get 
there to be what we should 
be. … It starts to develop your 
championship mentality.”
It is undeniable that the 
departure of key players like 
Noseworthy — a team captain 
and 
USILA 
Academic 
All-
American 
who 
holds 
the 
program’s all-time goal-scoring 
record with 102 — leaves a void 
both on and off the field for 
Michigan. 
But Conry expects a new 
class of leaders — including 
captains 
senior 
midfielder 
Avery Myers, graduate student 
midfielder 
Peter 
Hollen 
and senior goalkeeper Matt 
Trowbridge — to step up, build 
off the momentum of their 
predecessors and guide a roster 
featuring 16 freshmen and 10 
sophomores.
“Although we changed our 
roster over significantly, the 
mindset is still the same from 
our leadership,” Conry said. 
“Our guys came away with (the 
Ohio State) game saying ‘Okay, 
I know what I need to do now 
to get ugly and dirty and do it 
when no one else is watching, so 
that we can be great later on in 
the year. But I’m going to focus 
on right now.’ ”
Despite 
the 
losses 
of 
Noseworthy and Curran, who 
rank second and fourth for 
total points in program history, 
Michigan’s offense retains a 
firm majority of last year’s 
productivity. 
“We don’t replace guys like 
Noseworthy 
and 
Curran,” 
Conry said. “We look for a lot 
of guys to go ahead and pick up 

the slack … We still have a lot of 
goals and a lot of playing time 
back on the field.”
Most 
importantly, 
the 
Wolverines 
return 
their 
entire attack line: sophomore 
Bryce Clay and juniors Alex 
Buckanavage and Kevin Mack. 
Clay, who burst onto the scene 
as a freshman last year with 
22 goals, was named a Big Ten 
Player 
to 
Watch 
alongside 
Buckanavage and sophomore 
defenseman 
Andrew 
Darby. 
After finishing first and second 
on the team in total points last 
season, Buckanavage and Mack 
are expected to continue their 
offensive dominance in their 
third year as starters.
At midfield, the Wolverines 
look to Myers, who finished 
second on the team in goals 
with 24 last season, and Hollen, 
a 
solid, 
tenured 
defensive 
midfielder, for leadership and 
experience. After missing all 
of 2019 due to injury, fifth-
year senior midfielder Rocco 
Sutherland hopes to return 
to the level of productivity 
he showed as a junior when 
he notched nine goals and 13 

assists. Under the guidance of a 
veteran midfield core, freshmen 
like 
Jake 
Bonomi, 
Jacob 
Jackson and Josh Zawada will 
be integrated into the mix and 
are expected to see significant 
playing time early on in their 
careers.
On the defensive side of the 
field, Michigan must move on 
from its former swiss-army 
knife, 
Nick 
DeCaprio, 
who 
anchored 
down 
its 
defense 
last season and led the team 
in 
ground 
balls 
(34) 
and 
caused turnovers (27). After 
an impressive freshman year 
alongside DeCaprio and senior 
Michael Borda at close defense, 
Darby is expected to lead a 
young Michigan defense that 
will feature freshmen like Dylan 
Gardner and Ryan Schriber. 
In addition to Darby, the 
Wolverines bring back junior 
defenseman JD Carroll, who 
missed all of last season due 
to injury, and senior long-stick 
midfielder 
Finn 
Goonan 
to 
add some age to Michigan’s 
defensive lineup.
“(We had) one Nick DeCaprio. 
Now we have four or five really 

high 
quality 
defensemen,” 
Conry said. “We have extra 
depth at the defensive position 
that we don’t need one guy to do 
it all … We’re piecing it together. 
We got a group of guys who we 
are really comfortable with and 
can make the transition. And 
that’s really positive for us.”
After rotating between now-
graduated goalkeepers Tommy 
Heidt and Gunner Garn last 
season, a battle for the starting 
job persists this year between 
Trowbridge 
and 
sophomore 
John Kiracofe. Although neither 
has 
racked 
up 
significant 
minutes at the college level 
thus far, the Wolverines hope 
that either player will be able 
stabilize their defensive unit 
between the pipes.
Last 
season, 
Michigan’s 
biggest team struggles stemmed 
from problems at the faceoff X, 
where it only won 32 percent of 
faceoffs. After losing all three 
of his true faceoff-men to a 
myriad of injuries, Conry was 
forced to insert a mix of players, 
including Noseworthy, Goonan 
and DeCaprio, to try and tie up 
opponents. With senior Matt 

Dellacroce 
and 
sophomore 
Nick Rowlett now healthy, the 
Wolverines expect to benefit 
from greater security at the 
position. 
“It’ll be really exciting once 
we win a couple (faceoffs),” 
Conry said. “Adding them really 
just gives a spark in the ball. We 
have a pretty efficient, high-
powered offense that we feel 
comfortable once the ball gets 
down there we can create some 
quality opportunities.”
Overall, Michigan’s schedule 
is fierce, featuring matchups 
against six teams currently 
ranked in the Inside Lacrosse 
Top 
25 
rankings—including 
titans like Penn State and Yale, 
who both reached the 2019 
Final Four and return the bulk 
of their key players from last 
season. 
While no easy task, Conry, 
now in his third season as 
the Wolverines’ head coach, 
believes that his team can 
compete with the best teams 
in college lacrosse. And after 
beating Ohio State, the players 
have begun to believe that they 
can too.

Wolverines dominate Gators, 4-0

Guilia Pairone smashed a ball to 
the right side and let out a scream. 
Her 
opponent 
never 
even 
moved. 
The senior finished off her 
singles match with the confidence 
that the entire No. 10 Michigan 
women’s 
tennis 
team 
(2-1) 
exemplified in a 4-0 win over No. 
24 Florida (1-2) on Tuesday. 
The Wolverines set the tone 
in the doubles. Sophomore Anca 
Craciun and junior Alyvia Jones 
quickly jumped out to a 4-0 lead 
and had a bounce in their step as 
they dominated the Gators. In the 
fifth set, Jones blasted two aces to 
put the duo on the brink of victory. 
After dropping the next set, it 
was Craciun’s turn to serve. She 
launched one down the middle that 
Florida’s Marlee Zein mishit and 
it gave them a 6-1 win in their first 
ever match together.
“I think both of us were serving 
really well,” Craciun said. “Once 
we started getting those easy free 
points we just kind of loosened up.”
They then turned their attention 
to the next court over, where 
Pairone and senior Chiara Lommer 
looked to secure the doubles 
point for Michigan. Leading 5-3, 
Lommer took a deep breath and 
served the potential match point. 
She laid it down the left side and 

the return sailed long, giving the 
duo the 6-3 win. Lommer let out an 
emphatic scream and confidently 
walked forward to shake hands 
with her opponents, knowing she 
had put her team in prime position 
to win. 
“I thought we played a really 
good match,” Pairone said. “I was 
setting (Lommer) up really well 
and she was closing off all of the 
points.”
After grabbing the doubles 
point, the Wolverines moved to the 
singles matches and continued to 
make short work of the Gators. 
Freshman Nicole Hammond 
powered her way to a win in straight 
sets over Florida’s Ida Jarlskog and 
quickly gave Michigan a second 
point. 
“She strikes the ball so well, 
so it’s hard to hang with her,” 
Michigan coach Ronni Bernstein 
said. “She made very few unforced 
errors.” 
On the other side of the arena, 
Pairone and Craciun carried the 
momentum from their doubles 
performance. 
Pairone 
came 
out firing against the Gators’ 
McCartney Kessler and raced out 
to a 4-1 lead. After trading games, 
Kessler sent a shot long and Pairone 
pumped her fist as she took the first 
set, 6-2. 
“I knew how to play with her,” 
Pairone said. “I was very positive 
and I knew what to do.”

On the next court over, Craciun 
was 
performing 
with 
equal 
confidence against Florida’s Tsveta 
Dimitrova. She took the first set, 
6-1, after Dimotrova sent her 
return into the net. Craciun calmy 
walked to her bench to prepare for 
the next set. 
Pairone, though, was anything 
but calm. 
She let out fiery screams after 
every game and was extremely 
animated. 
“I always have a lot of energy,” 
Pairone said. “I’m very loud so 
that’s just who I am.”
She took a 5-1 lead before 
dropping the next set. It was clear 
that would be the last time she 
lost. She laid down some sizzling 
shots to win the match 6-1, 6-2. 
After securing the victory, she ran 
to the bench, dropped her racket 
and turned to watch her teammate 
finish off the Gators. 
Craciun won two key deuce 
points to go up, 5-1, but then 
dropped the next set. 
The entire team looked on as 
Craciun geared up for the final 
serve of the match. Craciun 
watched the return sail wide and 
the match was over. 
“I was just looking around at my 
team,” Craciun said. “I knew they 
were there for me.”
And after securing the win, 
Pairone was the first one there to 
leap into Craciun’s arms.

Pitching depth provides opportunity

Over the past two seasons, 
the Michigan softball team’s 
success in the circle has largely 
fallen on the shoulders of one 
athlete: 
junior 
left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien. 
But this season, as sophomore 
right-hander 
Alex 
Storako 
comes into her own and the 
Wolverines welcome two more 
pitchers 
onto 
their 
roster, 
Beaubien may be able to give her 
arm a rest from time to time. 
For the first time in 20 
years, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
pitching staff now boasts five 
pitchers: 
Beaubien, 
Storako, 
freshman left-hander Lauren 
Esman, 
freshman 
right-
hander Chandler Dennis and 
junior 
right-hander 
Sarah 
Schaefer. But with so many of 
Michigan’s 
options 
untested 
and unseasoned, it’s too early 
to tell what impact the added 
depth will have. 

Esman was ranked the No. 65 
recruit nationally by FloSoftball 
in the 2019 class. As a senior 
in high school, she posted an 
ERA of 0.42 and racked up 341 
strikeouts in 148.2 innings. 
But collegiate play is a whole 
different 
ballgame. 
Pitchers 
face a different caliber of batter 
and a new level of pressure. For 
Storako, it took a full year until 
she felt like she’d found her 
personality in the circle. Esman 
may be a similar case. 
“We haven’t utilized Esman 
as much going into this part of 
the year,” Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins said. “We’ve been 
kind of working her slow. We’re 
picking that up a little bit. She’s 
not as far along as we might 
need her to be, so she might have 
to get on the fast-track.”
For 
Dennis 
— 
the 
No. 
29-ranked recruit by FloSoftball 
— 
that 
transition 
may 
be 
happening a bit faster. She 
registered a 1.04 ERA in high 
school and was a three-year 
All-State honoree in Georgia. 
Hutchins has made it clear that 

both of the new additions will 
get the opportunity to prove 
themselves this season. 
“(Dennis) is definitely better 
this semester than she was last 
semester,” Hutchins said. “I 
think (Dennis) is really capable 
of some great things, and I 
think she needs to see herself 
as great. She needs to have 
some determination everyday 
and every pitch — like all of 
them. They’re always a work in 
progress.”
Schaefer 
rounds 
out 
the 
Wolverines’ 
bullpen 
as 
the 
third returning pitcher, though 
she’ll be out with an injury for 
at least a month. Even when she 
returns, it’s unclear how much 
time she’ll spend in the circle. 
Her 
freshman 
season, 
Schaefer posted a stellar ERA 
of 1.57 — although only pitched 
62.1 innings — but she was 
largely absent from last season’s 
rotation, finishing with only 17.2 
innings pitched and an ERA of 
3.17. 
In practice, the added depth 
on 
this 
year’s 
roster 
may 
not make a huge difference. 
Hutchins and the rest of her 
assistant coaches may choose to 
stick with last season’s rotation 
of Beaubien and Storako — the 
tried and true pairing that 
carried the team to a Big Ten 
Tournament win. But their 
goal is to use the entire staff. If 
even one of the other pitchers 
becomes a reliable option, it 
would be a game-changer for 

the Wolverines. 
While Michigan is always 
a force in the Big Ten, it has 
struggled in recent years to 
compete 
with 
west-coast 
powerhouses in the postseason. 
The Wolverines haven’t made 
it out of Super Regionals since 
2016 when they lost in the 
second round of the World 
Series. But a third pitcher in 
the rotation could be what takes 
Michigan to the next level. 
Most top-ranked programs 
— including Florida and Florida 
State who the Wolverines will 
face at next weekend’s Wilson-
Demarini tournament — have 
more 
than 
two 
consistent 
pitchers. But the last time 
Michigan was able to use three 
pitchers 
in 
relatively 
even 
amounts was 2014. 
Pitching 
upwards 
of 
10 
innings a weekend, it’s easy for 
a pitcher to get worn out by the 
end of the season. But more than 
that, it’s about having someone 
to pick up the slack. 
“The beauty of (having five 
pitchers) is if somebody isn’t 
on and somebody else isn’t 
on, hopefully the next person 
will be and we really use the 
staff,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“We 
certainly need to have high level 
performance from each of them. 
That’s going to be the key.”
There’s 
no 
question 
the 
Wolverines’ pitching staff has 
the talent to make that happen. 
The issue will lie in how soon 
they find their rhythm.

Austin Davis a bright spot in loss

It’s been just over three weeks 
since Austin Davis first started 
showing poise as a reliable 
backup big man. And now poise, 
as it turns out, may have been a 
bit of an understatement.
This may be the Austin Davis 
breakout season, or at least as 
close to it as could have been 
reasonably expected.
It’s not as if he’s going to 
replace his fellow senior center, 
Jon Teske, in the starting lineup 
(at least barring any injuries). 
But Davis is continuing to get 
significant playing time, and 
has 
surpassed 
sophomore 
forward Colin Castleton in the 
rotation.
As he’s continued to get 
those significant minutes, he’s 
continued to do significant 
things with them.
A 
surprising 
twist 
this 
season, to be sure. Davis has 
given 
Michigan 
a 
reliable 
presence in the low post and 
a few buckets when it needed 
them most.
But when you get down to it, 
it’s not hard to see from where 

this sudden production has 
emerged. 
“He’s 
a 
tough-nosed 
competitor,” Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard said Tuesday 
night. “He does a really good 
job of using his body. He’s not 
afraid of contact. He loves 
the contact. He welcomes the 
contact. And not just tonight, 
but a lot of the other games 
we 
played 
throughout 
the 
year. He’s always accepted the 
challenge.”
In a 61-58 loss to Ohio State, 
Davis finished with 11 points, 
on 4-for-4 shooting from the 
field and 3-for-3 from the free 
throw line. He pulled down 
three rebounds, two on offense 
and one on defense. Not bad for 
14 minutes.
In fact, it’s not that hard to 
compare Davis’ stat line from 
last night — a career high for 
him — to some put up by Teske, 
the starter at the position.
“I’m 
just 
trying 
to 
be 
aggressive, play within our 
offense, play within myself,” 
Davis said. “I’ll take open looks 
when they’re there, and just put 
our team in the best position to 
win.

“I think it’s just confidence. 
Confidence in my teammates, 
confidence in myself. That’s the 
biggest thing.”
Perhaps this takeoff from 
Davis 
— 
who, 
it’s 
worth 
mentioning, 
was 
recruited 
and 
oft-praised 
by 
former 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
— is a reflection on, or maybe a 
result of, Howard’s new tenure 
at the helm of the program. 
Howard has worked intensively 
with all four bigs on the roster 
throughout the course of the 
season, 
watching 
film 
and 
teaching them post play. 
The fruits of that labor are 
probably clearest when looking 
at Teske. But they’re becoming 
more and more evident in 
Davis, too. For both Davis 
and Howard, the hard work is 
paying off. 
“It 
started 
back 
in 
the 
summer, when we had some 
player 
development 
time,” 
Howard said. “I work with 
all our bigs. Austin, just like 
all the bigs, has been working 
extremely hard leading up to 
this point in practice, spending 
time learning post play. 
“Austin has always had it.”

Two weeks that changed the season

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team had one week 
without a game, its season on the 
brink of disaster. One week to 
right the ship.
First came the Jan. 9 road 
loss to Ohio State, where the 
Wolverines led for 27 minutes 
total, even up to halfway through 
the fourth quarter. Then it was 
the 28-point home loss to No. 17 
Maryland on Jan. 12, just two 
weeks after Michigan played 
a tight game through three 
quarters on the road against the 
Terrapins.
But what looked like the 
dagger came a week later against 
Nebraska. Senior forward Kayla 
Robbins — the Wolverines’second-
leading scorer — went down in the 
first minute with a season-ending 
ACL tear, and Michigan lost after 
blowing a 13-point third-quarter 
lead. 
The 
loss 
dropped 
the 
Wolverines to 3-4 in the Big 
Ten and out of ESPN’s NCAA 
tournament prediction, and the 
loss of Robbins just prior to a 
three-game stretch against three 
of the Big Ten’s top five teams 
looked like it would be difficult 
to overcome. Michigan knew 
the challenge it would face in 
overcoming Robbins’ absence, but 
it stayed optimistic.
“Don’t let today knock you out 
of the water,” Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico said after 
the loss to Maryland. “All our 
games this year have been really 
competitive. It’s been a tough 
stretch, but we’ve got to grow 
from it, we’ve got to learn from it.”
Lucky for the Wolverines, 
though, they had a week off 
between the Nebraska loss and 
their next game against Rutgers 
— a rare occurrence in Big Ten 
play. And for Michigan it was no 
ordinary week of practice. The 
bench players had to adjust to the 
new roles they would play. Senior 
guard Akienreh Johnson had 
to prepare to guard opponents’ 

top offensive threat — typically 
Robbins’ job.
The Wolverines had to adapt to 
life without Kayla Robbins.
“We just talked about one-
through-10 has to step up on the 
court, off the court, in practice,” 
sophomore forward Naz Hillmon 
said. “Somebody needs to take on 
the little things she did. Anything 
they can do to be a part of what 
Kayla was to this team because 
she was just such a huge part, 
whether she was talking, or 
scoring or rebounding.”
From 
the 
opening 
tip-off 
against the Scarlet Knights, it was 
clear Michigan took the message 
to heart. It shot 50 percent from 
the floor and excelled on the 
defensive end, forcing 15 first-half 
turnovers. Johnson held Rutgers’ 
leading 
scorer, 
guard 
Arella 
Guirantes, below her season 
average. Johnson didn’t shut her 
down — she still finished with 16 
points — but she filled in well in 
place of Robbins.
While beating the Scarlet 
Knights at home was a good 
start for the Wolverines without 
Robbins, they still had two tough 
games against the Big Ten’s best, 
No. 23 Northwestern and No. 
18 Iowa. Winning either would 
be huge for Michigan’s NCAA 
Tournament chances.
Against 
the 
Wildcats, 
the 
Wolverines came out flat and 
couldn’t overcome an early deficit, 
but a strong final three quarters 
in an eight-point loss gave them 
optimism entering Sunday’s game 

against the Hawkeyes. It would 
be one of their last chances to pick 
up the signature win that Barnes 
Arico has talked about needing so 
much of late.
Sunday, Michigan came out 
strong and for much of the game 
looked as good as it had all season. 
The loss of Robbins was barely 
even noticeable. A combination 
of 
Johnson, 
Hillmon 
and 
sophomore guard Amy Dilk held 
Iowa’s leading scorer Kathleen 
Doyle below her season average, 
and the Wolverines’ bench and 
sophomore guard Danielle Rauch 
— who replaced Robbins in the 
starting lineup — combined for 17 
points, as Michigan won by 15.
“We’ve had a little bit of a 
rocky start to the Big Ten season,” 
Hillmon said. “So just getting 
these wins, it’s very important to 
us and our confidence. The Big 
Ten is a tough league and to get 
this one is huge, and it’ll definitely 
help us later on.”
Even though the Wolverines 
have played three good games 
without Robbins, her absence 
could still play a factor going 
forward. Teams may find holes in 
the way Michigan plays without 
Robbins and expose them. But 
after an injury that could have 
sunk the team just over two 
weeks ago, the Wolverines look 
rejuvenated and motivated.
And looking back, the most 
important week of Michigan’s 
season might have been the week 
in which it didn’t play a single 
game.

Michigan’s defense gives leadership

When Mel Pearson looked at 
the roster at the beginning of the 
season, he viewed it through two 
lenses.
The first was strengths. In 
Pearson’s eyes, Michigan was 
stacked with offensive weapons. It 
would be a goal-scoring team. An 
offensive powerhouse.
But the defense and goaltending 
were potential weaknesses, or at 
least question marks. Sophomore 
goaltender Strauss Mann hadn’t 
yet emerged as the Wolverines’ 
starter. On the blueline, they’d 
have to replace three skaters — 
last season’s point leader Quinn 
Hughes, Joseph Cecconi and Nick 
Boka. 
The 
only 
upperclassmen 
returning were seniors Griffin 
Luce 
and 
Luke 
Martin. 
Sophomores Nick Blankenburg 
and Jack Summers accounted 
for another third of the blueline. 
Michigan’s final two pieces were 
incoming freshmen Cam York and 
Keaton Pehrson. 
Someone 
would 
have 
to 
show them the ropes, and that 
responsibility fell on the shoulders 
of Martin and Luce. It was their 
job to pave the way for the younger 
players. To lead by example. 
And they’ve done exactly that. 
As the season’s progressed, 
Pearson’s concerns about the 
Wolverines’ defense vanished. It 
emerged as the strongest part of an 
otherwise struggling team.
“They’ve done great,” Pearson 
said. “Real pleasant surprise. 
We’re committed more as a 
team to playing better team 
defense overall. That’s helped us 
immensely. … We haven’t been 
giving up as many outnumbered 
rushes like we did last year or 
turnovers. We’ve done a much 
better job of managing the puck 
this year.”
Until 
recently, 
Michigan’s 
record didn’t reflect the defense’s 
success. Earlier in the season, it 
went winless through a period 
of 
seven 
games. 
When 
the 
Wolverines couldn’t rely on their 
offense to produce, they relied 
on the defense to keep the games 
within reach. And they did just 

that, losing four of the games by 
only one goal.
After that string of games, 
Michigan started collecting wins. 
It split series with Wisconsin and 
Penn State, largely because of its 
defense. The Wolverines almost 
posted a shutout against the sixth-
ranked offense in the nation, 
beating the Nittany Lions, 4-1. 
While the team wasn’t climbing 
in the rankings, its defense 
— currently ranked seventh in 
scoring — was. Allowing just 2.14 
goals per game, Michigan owes a 
large part of its sustained success 
to its six defensemen and Mann.
“Up until after Christmas, we 
didn’t really score much,” Pearson 
said. “We needed to be good 
defensively to sort of hang around 
until we got our legs underneath 
us and started running instead of 
crawling.”
Much 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive success is attributed to 
its anchor, Mann. Rightfully so, as 
there’s a handful 
of games where 
he was the reason 
Michigan 
won. 
But the skaters in 
front of him have 
played a pivotal 
role too.
York 
and 
Pehrson 
have 
found their roles 
on 
the 
team. 
They’ve 
settled 
in and managed the pressure 
well. They’ve avoided getting 
overwhelmed — something that’s 
often a challenge for younger 
players to do when their team’s 
struggling. 
Summers and Blankenburg have 
made strides, too. Both of them add 
offense from the blueline. 
And then there’s Martin and 
Luce. Through the loss of three key 
defenders and all the Wolverines’ 
struggles, their roles increased 
exponentially. With the team 
relying on them and the spotlight 
pointed their way, they’ve shown 
nothing but confidence and focus.
“I’ve gotten a lot more confident 
with the puck and with my feet,” 
Martin said. “And just working 
on my mental game. (Director of 
Athletic Counseling) Greg Harden 
has been unbelievable for me. He’s 

just helped me in so many areas. 
Just growing mentally and taking 
strides there. It’s done wonders for 
my game on the ice.”
All these factors — Mann, 
Martin, Luce’s confidence and the 
underclassmen’s efforts — are the 
reason why Michigan’s defense 
has found so much success in its 
last three weekend series. 
On the road against then-No. 
14 Notre Dame on Jan. 10-11, the 
Wolverines allowed only one goal 
on the weekend. After giving up a 
goal in the first few minutes of the 
Saturday game, the defense settled 
down and paved the way for 
Michigan to make its comeback.
This trend continued the next 
weekend at then-No. 6 Penn State. 
In the Friday night game, the 
Wolverines kept the Nittany Lions 
off the scoresheet. The following 
night, the defense lagged a bit, 
allowing four goals, but Michigan 
managed to steal the extra point in 
double overtime.
“It’s 
nice 
to 
score 
six 
goals 
like we did at 
Penn 
State,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“But it’s the zero 
that’s important. 
If you do that, 
you’re going to 
win some games. 
Defense has to be 
paramount to this 
team.”
Last weekend, the Wolverines 
split with then-No. 11 Ohio State. 
They surrendered four goals to the 
Buckeyes on Saturday night, after 
giving up only one the night before. 
Even so, Michigan significantly 
limited 
Ohio 
State’s 
scoring 
chances. 
Four goals is uncharacteristic 
for Michigan’s blueline, but a 
bad game hasn’t ever rattled the 
defense. It’s always been able to 
bounce back and come out strong 
the next night.
“You can’t put enough emphasis 
on it,” Pearson said. “You’re going 
to go through stretches like that 
where you don’t score and you’re 
pressing. But if you don’t give 
anything up then you don’t need 
as much. It’s critical. It’s vital to 
having success and for us to turn it 
(the season) around.”

‘M’ looking to follow success of 2019

Sometimes having the best 
season in program history may 
lead to a feeling of complacency — 
satisfaction in a day’s work.
Not for the Michigan women’s 
lacrosse team. After a 2019 
campaign that saw a shattered 
record in the win column and 
first NCAA Tournament bid, the 
team is approaching 2020 with 
the ambition to build on what it 
did last year.
“I think the team has returned 
with even more hunger than we 
had last year,” Michigan coach 
Hannah 
Nielsen 
said. 
“And 
they know and have that belief 
from last year of what we can 
accomplish.”
It’s pretty easy to transition to 
a new season when there aren’t 
a lot of questions surrounding 
the team. And when you return 
eight starters who contributed 
to 77 percent of your team’s 
points, there really aren’t a lot of 
questions to be asked. 
One of those starters, junior 
attacker 
Caitlin 
Muir, 
broke 
both the program single-season 
goals and assists records last year 
with 59 and 21, respectively. This 
returning offense means the team 
can spend less time adjusting to 
new additions and simply carry 
the momentum from last year. 

The list of returning starters 
also includes all three of the 
Wolverines’ captains — senior 
defenseman Maggie Handlan, 
senior goalie Alli Kothari and 
senior midfielder Molly Garrett. 
“Being a captain last year was 
a very big honor just as it is this 
year, too,” Garrett said. “And I 
think having that experience and 
a year under my belt especially 
with Allie and Maggie, who are 
also returning captains makes us 
stronger, more experienced and 
have that knowledge of how we 
should handle things.”
This knowledge will help a 
lot with the transition for the 
younger players — either from 
high school to college games or 
from a less prominent role to 
carrying more of the load.
Nielsen also thought there 
were a lot of younger players 
who were ready to step into more 
prominent roles this season.
“(Sophomore 
midfielder) 
Kaitlyn Mead is one that I think,” 
Nielsen said. “Just her body size 
and her strength and her athletic 
ability alone, she’s capable of so 
much and is improving with the 
game-sense side as well.”
Nielsen 
seemed 
optimistic 
about many of the other young 
players as well, and thinks by the 
end of the season a lot of them 
should be able to contribute even 
more.

These players, in combination 
with all of the returning starters, 
have the chance to shoot even 
higher than they did last year. 
Though, there is still one thing 
that stands in their way.
The Big Ten has been ruled 
lately by two national powers: 
Northwestern 
and 
defending 
national 
champion 
Maryland. 
All three of the Wolverines’ 
conference losses last season 
were to these teams.
“We certainly want to be 
competing with Maryland and 
Northwestern, who have been 
the top dogs in the conference 
for the last five years,” Nielsen 
said. “It seems so with how we’ve 
been performing, I think it’s a 
possibility.”
Last season, the Wildcats 
ended Michigan’s conference title 
hopes with a 19-9 victory in the 
Big Ten Tournament semifinal. 
This is the type of game that 
the Wolverines hope to not only 
compete in this year, but win.
The Terrapins, though, are 
a whole different animal. The 
defending national champions 
dominated Michigan, 14-3, in 
College Park last season.
“Obviously, we want to be 
competing at the top,” Nielsen 
said. “We got our minds set on 
going one further and making 
that 
Big 
Ten 
Championship 
game.”
