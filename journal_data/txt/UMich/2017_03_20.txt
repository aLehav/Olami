Beginning as a collection 

of anecdotal interviews with 
more than 200 women in 
1996, The Vagina Monologues 
has since evolved over time 
to 
include 
more 
diverse 

storylines, 
actors 
and 

sexualities in order to be 
representative 
of 
the 
full 

spectrum 
of 
the 
female 

experience.

More than 100 students 

gathered Friday and Saturday 
night 
inside 
Rackham 

Auditorium 
to 
watch 
the 

University’s 
fifth-annual 

production 
of 
the 
play 

directed by LSA junior Clare 
Fairbanks, 
also 
a 
Daily 

copy editor, and produced 
by 
Business 
senior 
Edith 

Zhang. The show was held by 
Students for Choice, a leading 
abortion-rights 
group 
on 

campus. 

Originally 
written 
by 

playwright Eve Ensler, The 
Vagina Monologues consists 
of a series of monologues 
read by various women — 
each dealing with a different 
subject, such as masturbation 
and the female orgasm as 
well as heavier topics such as 
female genital mutilation and 
sexual assault.

In 
the 
“Producer’s 

Note,” Zhang wrote on the 
importance of understanding 
the show to be more than just 
talking about vaginas, as it 

also provides an opportunity 
to listen to people’s personal 
stories and empathize with 
their experiences — though 
possibly different than the 
viewer’s own.

“It’s 
scary, 
but 
these 

actresses push through the 
fear,” she wrote. “Because we 
need to hear these experiences 
that have long been hidden. 
To me, that’s what the The 
Vagina Monologues is about. 

Not about vaginas or periods 
or assault or sex or love or 
moaning or rape or race or 
masturbating or even just 
being a woman. Though each 
topic is covered in a monologue 
and each monologue is a real 
experience, the show overall 
is more than its lady parts. 
It’s a chance to speak up. It’s a 
chance to learn about people. 
It’s a chance to listen. So 
please, listen.”

For the second year, a 

pre-show consisting of eight 
University-student-written 
monologues was performed 
before the commencement of 
the Eve Ensler show. Because 
of the personal nature of the 
monologues, 
content 
was 

not recorded, though themes 
included 
being 
fetishized 

because of one’s race, poor sex 
education in schools and the

of an ongoing series of articles 
outlining specific initiatives of 
Central Student Government on 
campus.

The Bystander Intervention 

and Community Engagement 
program is designed to engage 
students by informing them 
about sexual misconduct and 
providing them with tools and 
strategies to address the issue.

LSA sophomore Samantha 

Kennedy, co-coordinator at the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center, stressed the 
importance of this program in 
highlighting the prevalence 
of sexual assault on campus, 
as well as providing students 
with tools to address these 
situations.

“Bystander Intervention is 

a form of preventative work 
that 
focuses 
on 
secondary 

prevention — that means we 
are acknowledging that sexual 
misconduct 
unfortunately 

still exists on campus and 
still occurs in the majority of 
spaces,” she said. “We want to

President Donald Trump’s 

preliminary budget proposal 
— released on Thursday — 
could sever the $300 million 
dollars per year Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative effort 
to clean the Great Lakes basin, 
according to The Detroit News. 
It would cut the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s budget by 
almost one-third overall.

The GLRI began in 2010 to 

protect and restore the Great 
Lakes. In addition to the 
clean-up effort, the initiative 
also aims to control invasive 
species, 
reduce 
nutrient 

runoff and restore habitats 
in the region. It operates 
as 
a 
collaboration 
among 

states, tribes, municipalities, 
universities 
and 
other 

organizations, according to its 
website.

In a statement, U.S. Rep. 

Debbie 
Dingell 
(D–Mich.) 

expressed concern that the 
Trump administration’s new 
budget distorts national values.

KEVIN SANTO

Managing Sports Editor

INDIANAPOLIS — John Beilein 

was grinning, peeking around the 
corner of the door.

Then he jumped into the locker 

room, Super Soaker in tow, and the 
water started flying.

Michigan was going to the Sweet 

16 in Kansas City, Mo. The only thing 
that could have made it sweeter was 
if it was legal to use champagne.

“Coach told us that he bought 

a Super Soaker last night,” said 
redshirt sophomore forward DJ 
Wilson. “Because he knew that we 
were going to come out with a win.”

And right he was, as the 

Wolverines 
defeated 
Louisville, 

73-69, to solidify a place in the Sweet 
16 and simultaneously give Beilein a 
second victory against Rick Pitino 
that had eluded him since 2005.

“I went into this game with a lot of 

confidence that I was gonna be using 
it at the end of that game,” Beilein 
said. “At the end of the first half, I 
wasn’t so sure the Super Soaker — it 
was ever gonna be known I had it. 
But we withstood everything they 
had and won the game.”

More than anyone else, Beilein 

has Moritz Wagner to thank for 
that.

Michigan’s sophomore big man 

scored a game-high 26 points on 
11-for-14 
shooting, 
willing 
the 

Wolverines forward in a game that 
— for the majority of the contest — 
looked like it was Louisville’s for the 
taking.

Michigan (10-8 Big Ten, 26-11 

overall) entered the matchup as the 
No. 4 team in the nation in adjusted 
offensive efficiency according to 
Ken Pomeroy. The Cardinals (12-6 
ACC, 25-9 overall), on the other 
hand, took the floor as seventh-

ranked team in adjusted defensive 
efficiency.

In a battle of offensive juggernaut 

and 
defensive 
powerhouse, 

something had to give. In the first 
half, it was Michigan’s offense that 
lost out.

Senior guard Derrick Walton Jr. 

— the man who has been carrying 
Michigan through March— didn’t 
score until the 4:56 mark, when 
he knocked down a pair from the 
charity stripe. Until his 3-pointer 
with 2:33 remaining, Walton was 
0-for-6 from the field. Still, even at 
that point, the Wolverines trailed by 
just three.

In reality, Michigan was lucky 

that was so.

The Wolverines shot 37 percent 

from the floor and were 3-for-11 from 
behind the arc. Louisville didn’t fair 
much better — shooting 42 percent 
from the floor — but dominated 
Michigan on the boards, grabbing 
24 rebounds to the Wolverines’ 16. 
Ten of those came on the offensive 
glass, and the Cardinals made 
Michigan pay, scoring 11 second-
chance points in the first half.

The 
Wolverines’ 
offensive 

struggles culminated in a five-
minute scoring drought that was 
only broken at the 7:57 mark by 
a Wagner layup. Michigan was 
fortunate that Louisville went on a 
scoring drought of its own — failing 
to hit from the field for nearly four 
minutes.

But forward Deng Adel ended 

that 
drought 
with 
authority, 

coasting down the floor on a fast 
break before putting Wilson on a 
poster to give Louisville a five-point 
lead.

Shortly thereafter, it looked like 

Michigan’s luck had finally run out, 
that the story of the team that went 
through a plane crash and made a 
tournament run was coming to a 
close.

It looked like — once again — Rick 

Pitino was going to get the better of 
John Beilein.

There was just over a minute left 

in the frame when Louisville guard 
Donovan Mitchell hit the triple — 
marking just his third field goal of 
the frame.

Adel followed Mitchell’s lead, 

converting from beyond the arc 
on the Cardinals’ next offensive 
possession. And then he nailed a 
pair from the free-throw line.

One minute and 10 seconds, 

an eight-point swing, and the 
Wolverines went from tied at 28 to 
trailing by eight at the half.

But Wagner came out firing.
He scored eight of Michigan’s 

first 10 points in the second half, 
starting what would eventually 
become a 17-point second-half total 
for the sophomore. The Cardinals 
still proved too much, opening 
4-for-6 from the floor to counteract 
Wagner’s individual effort.

Eventually, though, senior wing 

Zak Irvin joined the party — scoring 
six straight points with 13:25 
remaining to cut Michigan’s deficit 
to three. Just over four minutes 
later, junior guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman finally put 
the Wolverines within striking 
distance, knocking down two free 
throws to tie the game at 53.

From there, it became a slugfest, 

with each team vying back and forth 
for the lead that could send them to 
the Sweet 16.

Wagner 
finally

One hundred and seventy 

University of Michigan Medical 

School students, all in their senior 

year, received exciting news on 

Friday as they learned where they 

will spend the next part of their 

journeys to becoming doctors.

Medical students spend much 

of their fourth year deciding which 

specialty they would like to focus 

on and then apply to residency 

programs in that field. Students rank 

their choices by preferences — this 

goes both ways as the hospitals 

where the programs are held rank 

the students who applied too.

The National Resident Matching 

Program then uses a computer 

to sort through the lists and pair 

students with hospitals. According 

to an article by Kara Gavin from 

the Michigan Health Lab, there are 

about 34,000 students vying for 

30,000 residency spots each year.

“It’s so complicated, and so well-

designed, that the researchers who 

came up with the concept got the 

Nobel Prize in Economics,” Gavin 

wrote. 

The day when students hear 

back; Match Day, occurs every year 

on the third Friday of March. This 

year, Michigan Medicine announced 

that nearly 99 percent of the 

University’s Medical School students 

were matched with a residency 

program, higher than the national 

average of nearly 96%, according 

to data released by the National 

Resident Matching Program.

Family and friends gathered 

with students at the North Campus 

Research Complex as they opened 

sealed envelopes containing the 

names of the programs and hospitals 

where they will spend the next 

couple of years. At the celebration, 

students are given the chance to 

open their envelopes on stage in 

front of the crowd or open them in 

private and then get up and read the 

results.

A video from the Medical School 

Admissions team’s Twitter account 

shows students reading their results 

to a cheering crowd at this year’s 

Match Day event.

“I’m Anthony, and I will be 

employed, training in anesthesiology 

at Santa Clara Valley Medical 

Center and Stanford University,” 

one student said in the video of this 

year’s Match Day.

About 30 percent of the 

graduating class will stay in the state 

for their residencies, with 22 percent 

continuing at Michigan Medicine. 

The rest of the class will scatter 

across the country to states including 

California, Illinois, Massachusetts 

and Texas.

Thirty-seven students will 

graduate this year with both a 

medical degree and an advanced 

graduate degree from another 

qualified program.

account tweeted, “#GoBlueMed!”

Gender in Information 
Careers: Getting your

focuses on gender, diversity and 
worth in the workplace

WHERE: North Quad, Rm 2255

He may only be a sophomore 

at the University of Michigan, 
but Business student Eduardo 
Amadeus Molon Batista has an 
affinity for taking on a wide range 
of responsibilities.

In activities such as managing 

a $5,000 budget as chief of finance 
in 
Mosher-Jordan 
Residence 

Hall and conducting research on 
developing a model that makes 
predictions in the stock market, 
Batista has taken advantage of the 
opportunities he encounters at the 
University.

He now hopes to become a 

representative for the Ross School 
of Business in the Central Student 
Government — as an independent 
candidate and the first Brazilian to 
run for this position. 

Born to parents who work as 

lawyers, Batista grew up in Sao 
Paulo, Brazil. Persuaded to attend 
a U.S. university by a childhood 
friend. Batista left Brazil to study 
business at the University.

Though he was surprised by 

some of the cultural differences 
he encountered after coming to 
the U.S., Batista is no stranger 
to adapting to foreign situations 
— he has traveled to 30 different 

countries throughout his life.

“My mom started a tradition 

where she took us to travel 
abroad to two to three countries 
every 
year,” 
he 
explained, 

believing his travels help him 
feel at ease with people almost 
anywhere he goes.

When asked what stood 

out to him after his move to 
Ann Arbor from Brazil, Batista 
replied 
simply 
with 
“the 

people.”

“So I actually had to buy a 

suit my first week on campus,” 
he said. “I went to Briarwood 
Mall and I didn’t have (enough) 
money. I think I had $80, but 
the suit was (more). And one 
guy heard me saying this to 
someone else and just offered 
me $20, and the cashier offered 
me a 10-percent discount, and 
someone else offered me a ride 
back to campus. (Also,) cars 
don’t usually stop for you in 
Brazil when you cross the street 
— they just speed up and honk 
and you get out of the way. But 
cars stop here. ... So people here 
are really nice.”

His freshman year, Batista 

was 
a 
consultant 
in 
the 

Michigan 
Emissary 
Group, 

which serves the community 
through pro bono consulting.

“We actually work just for 

the University (for things like) 
airBus, Planet Blue and many 
others,” he explained.

By his second semester, 

he 
became 
the 
youngest 

managing director of the club.

His responsibilities grew: Batista 
prepared 
curriculum 
for 
the 

training of 40 members, oversaw 
mentorship programs, relations 
with 
alumni 
and 
corporate 

sponsors, and helped run the club.

Batista has plans to improve 

student life both in the Business 
School and throughout campus, 
especially in regard to the DEI 
plan, the University’s long-term 
initiative to improve recognition 
of underrepresented groups on 
campus. He currently works with 
on the advisory board with E. 
Royster Harper, vice president for 
student life, to revise and improve 

the plan.

Batista said he believed the 

current plan is vague, and hopes 
to add structure to the plan to 
make it more effective. He plans to 
focus both on a campus-wide level 
and a Business School level. As a 
result of his active campaigning 
for CSG, Batista has already 
garnered a lot of support from 
student organizations as well as 
the undergraduate and graduate 
student populations at Ross.

At the beginning of the year, 

CSG released a demographic, 
showing 
how 
many 
of 
its 

representatives in the student 
assembly were mostly white, 
upper-class men. CSG President 
David Schafer, an LSA senior, said 
he planned to work on this during 

his administration. 

“Diversity 
is 
critical 
to 

ensuring that as a governing 
body, we are representative 
of every student on campus,” 
Schafer said in a press release. 
“We look forward to analyzing 
the results of the report and 
conceptualizing ways in which 
we can better represent our 
various constituencies.” 

For its undergraduates, the 

Business 
School’s 
in-coming 

class of 2016 pre-admit freshmen 
has a 7-percent minority student 
population — with 4 percent 
being international students, 
according to the Ross website.

The Ensler show echoed 

themes 
from 
the 
original 

interviews, 
which 
also 

viewed the female experience 
through a global lens with the 
performance of monologues 
such as “My Vagina Was My 
Village” and “One Billion will 
Rise for Justice.”

In “My Vagina was My 

Village,” performed by LSA 
senior 
Jessica 
Parent—a 

videographer for the Daily—a 
young Bosnian girl recalls 
being raped by soldiers during 
the war in Yugoslavia and how 
it left her feeling homeless in 
her own body.

“My vagina singing all girl 

songs, all goat bell ringing 
songs, all wild autumn field 
songs, vagina songs, vagina 
home songs,” Parent recited. 
“Not since they took turns for 
seven days smelling like feces 
and smoked meat, they left 
their dirty sperm inside me. I 
became a river of poison and 
pus and all the crops died, and 
the fish.”

Law 
student 
Rachel 

Menashe said she believes this 
monologue was hard-hitting, 
especially regarding current 
events.

“I thought the one about the 

Bosnian refugees was pretty 
intense and pretty poignant, 
especially with what’s going 
on currently,” she said.

topics tie into the goals of her 

organization.

“Students for Choice is the 

leading pro-choice group on 
campus, we do a lot of work 
around reproductive justice, 
which 
encompasses 
things 

like 
reproductive 
access, 

advocating for comprehensive 
sexual education, trying to 
reduce abortion stigma, things 
along those lines,” Webb said. 
“The 
Vagina 
Monologues 

really 
contributes 
to 
that 

goal by contributing to a lot 
of 
the 
conversations 
that 

are still kind of hidden and 
stigmatized. Of course college 
campuses and the world in 
general have become more 
progressive over time, but 
a lot of the time topics that 
are broached in The Vagina 
Monologues are conversations 
that still aren’t happening 
and it really highlights a lot 
of issues that are still really 
important.”

LSA junior Rachel Beglin, 

who performed an original 
piece regarding the current 
state of sex education, noted 
the power in being a part of 
such a strong, diverse group of 
women.

“I did the show last year 

and I absolutely loved it,” 
she said. “It is so powerful to 
be surrounded by powerful, 
unique 
women 
who 
have 

faced 
their 
share 
of 
cis-

heteropatriarchy, 
whether 

that’s 
from 
uncomfortable 

wiring in bras or sexual 
assault. We create a really 
strong, open community and 
relate and support each other. 
It’s awesome how close the 
cast gets.”

Beglin added that coming 

from a conservative state left 
her unprepared for her first 
sexual encounter, and that 
women need to know that it’s 
not their fault they were left 
misinformed 
and 
confused 

about 
their 
own 
anatomy 

growing up.

“I’m from a conservative 

state, and it’s truly frightening 
how underprepared I was for 
any sexual encounters,” she 
said. “It put me and my body in 
serious danger, and I wanted to 
talk about it. I wanted people 
to know that it’s OK that 
they’re not experts on their 
bodies and that it’s not their 
fault. I even had a professor 
who watched the show come 
up to me after and say that 
her sex ed was really similar 
to my experience. I think it’s 
important that before someone 
hears the entirety of a show 
about vaginas, they realize 
that young people aren’t even 
taught about their vaginas. I 
know some adults who don’t 
fully know what the vagina is.”

Law student Christine Crow 

said she thought The Vagina 
Monologues 
succeeded 
in 

giving trans-women a voice, 
as they are often left out of 
dialogue discussing feminine 
experiences.

In 
2004, 
The 
Vagina 

Monologues was performed by 
a cast of 18 trans-women, and a 
new monologue, “My Vagina” 
was included to represent the 
violence and hatred that they 
often face.

“I 
really 
loved 
the 

transgender woman’s speech, 
and in general all of the ones 
that they wrote themselves 
were absolutely mind blowing 
— but hers in particular was 
really amazing,” Crow said. 
“Trans-women are women.”

All proceeds from event 

ticket sales will to SafeHouse 
Center and V-Day, one a non-
profit organization, the other 
a global movement and both 
dedicated to ending violence 
against women. As of Saturday 
night, before final tickets 
sales were counted, more than 
$2,500 had been raised.

the blueprint President Trump 
released today is an egregious 
affront to the values I believe 
set this nation apart in the 
world,” she said.

She said the GLRI has been a 

longtime bipartisan priority.

“Those of us who live in the 

Great Lakes region know that 
these waters are more than a 
way of life — they are vital for 
clean drinking water, jobs and 
our economy,” she said. “This 
shortsighted attempt to zero 
out funding for the GLRI is 
unacceptable, and I will work 
diligently with my colleagues 
— Democrats and Republicans 
— to fight this effort and 
other irresponsible cuts that 
jeopardize our state and the 
people I represent.”

United 
States 
Senator 

Gary Peters (D–Mich.), who 

is a ranking nember of the 
Federal 
Spending 
Oversight 

Subcommittee, 
released 

a 
statement 
noting 
the 

importance of the drinking 
water provided by the Great 
Lakes.

“President Trump’s proposed 

budget makes drastic cuts that 
will hit Michigan families and 
businesses in both urban and 
rural areas especially hard, 
including cuts to transportation 
services education, job training, 
and programs that are essential 

for protecting the economic 
and environmental health of 
the Great Lakes, which provide 
drinking water to 40 million 
people and support Michigan’s 
multi-billion-dollar 
shipping, 

fishing 
and 
agricultural 

industries,” he stated.

Public 
Policy 
junior 

Rowan Conybeare, chair of 
the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 

College Democrats, noted the 
importance of freshwater and 
said she felt is wrong to inhibit 
programs looking to protect the 
resource.

“The Great Lakes are a water 

source for about 30 million 
people,” she said. “They may 
be 
Michigan’s 
number-one 

resource. I believe any cut 
in funding to programs that 
work to protect our water, 
like the EPA and the Great 
Lakes Initiative, is dangerous 
to 
Michigan’s 
citizens 
and 

wildlife.”

Engineering 
freshman 

Lincoln Merrill, publicity chair 
of 
the 
University’s 
chapter 

of College Republicans, said 
though he understands the 
concern, he does not believe 
such cuts will actually be 
enacted in the formal budget 
proposal, because there are 
many people on both sides of 
the aisle who do not agree with 
it.

“I don’t think it’s going 

to happen,” he said. “Even 
though the president proposes 
a budget, Congress is who 
actually passes it and they’re 
never, ever going to pass it. 
First of all, the Democrats don’t 
want it. Second, there’s a really 
interesting fact at play here. 
Whether you find something 
in the budget valuable or not 
depends on where you live. So 
Republicans from the Great 
Lakes states are saying: ‘Hold 
on. No, you’re not going to do 
this.’ ”

Merrill 
specifically 
cited 

Scott Walker, the governor of 
Wisconsin, as an example of 
a conservative politician who 
openly opposed the cuts. He 
said he believes Trump will not 
include such drastic measures 
in future proposals once he 
realizes what will and will not

pass Congress.

Immediately 
after 
the 

proposal’s 
release, 
Peters, 

Sen. 
Debbie 
Stabenow 
(D–

Mich.), and Sen. Rob Portman 
(R–Ohio) 
introduced 
the 

Great Lakes Fishery Research 
Authorization Act.

This bipartisan legislation 

aims 
to 
enhance 
funding, 

research 
and 
fishery 

management in the region. 
It grants the United States 
Geological 
Survey 
authority 

to support fishing, a $7 billion 
sport and commercial industry, 
in the region.

Portman, a co-chair of the 

Senate Great Lakes Task Force, 
said the Great Lakes are an 
“invaluable” resource to Ohio’s 
environment and economy.

“By authorizing the USGS’s 

Great Lakes Science Center 
for the first time, we are 
prioritizing the research on 
fish populations and invasive 
species used by the Great 
Lakes states as well as Canada 
to support the health and 
growth of our $7 billion fishing 
industry. This bill will ensure 
we have the resources to help 
protect the Great Lakes for 
generations to come.”

Michigan the edge — nailing 
one from deep with 6:41 left to 
play and jumpstarting an 8-2 
run that gave Michigan a six-
point lead.

With 56 seconds remaining, 

Louisville 
went 
into 

desperation mode and it nearly 
paid off, as the Cardinals forced 
a turnover with their full court 
press before hitting a layup to 

cut the Wolverines’ lead to two.

And yet, despite going 2-for-

12 in the game to that point, 
Walton 
converted 
when 
it 

mattered most —hitting a layup 
on the other end before Wilson 
put the game to bed from the 
charity stripe.

In 
the 
end, 
Michigan 

managed to outlast Louisville.

“We’re gonna do everything 

we can to win this whole thing,” 
Beilein said. “I’m no spring 
chicken in this thing. You get 
bad calls, you get injuries. … you 
get to the Sweet 16 and you’re 

only four games away from 
winning the whole thing. 

“… I don’t know who’s next, 

but I know we’re going to go 
into this thing not content with 
what we’ve done.”

For a long time, it looked like 

the story would end in Indy, 
like the Wolverines’ luck had 
run out and like John Beilein’s 
March history with Pitino was 
just too much to overcome.

But Wagner said the hell with 

luck, and the hell with history.

give communities that we work 
with the tools to recognize a 
potentially harmful situation 
and step in and take action.”

Public Policy senior Emma 

Zorfass, BICE co-coordinator, 
noted that while freshmen 
receive 
information 
and 

training within their initial 
few months at the University of 
Michigan, those conversations 
dwindle as they move forward 
in 
their 
college 
careers. 

Zorfass said this consistency 
is something SAPAC works 
to address, and BICE helps 
reach students through other 
communities they’re involved 
in.

“We’re really working on 

how to reach organizations 
and reach students later on 
in 
their 
careers,” 
Zorfass 

said. “For example, U of M 
has 
leading 
programs 
for 

incoming freshman — they 
have Haven even before they 
step on campus, they have 
Relationship Remix in the first 
couple weeks of freshman year 
and they have Change it Up 
within the first couple months. 
But beyond that, there’s no 
uniform 
programming 
for 

upperclassmen. So one way 
to 
reach 
upperclassmen 
is 

through the communities that 
they’re involved in.”

In 
December, 
Central 

Student Government instituted 
a 
new 
policy 
mandating 

all 
student 
groups 
seeking 

funding upward of $1,000 to 
send two authorized signers 
to training held in conjunction 
with Wolverine Wellness. As 
of February, CSG statistics 
showed 216 students from more 
than 100 organizations had 
attended a session. 

“We start with an overview 

of what sexual misconduct 
looks 
like, 
and 
what 
it 

encompasses 
because 
it 
is 

an umbrella term that does 
encompass 
various 
forms 

of 
sexual 
assault, 
stalking, 

intimate partner violence and 
sexual harassment,” Kennedy 
said. “We talk about data from 
the 
campus-climate 
survey 

to make the numbers that we 
always hear about in the media 
more real. Then we move into 
some 
tangible 
bystander-

intervention tools and different 
strategies and methods for 
noticing 
and 
interpreting 

pretty harmful situations.”

Though 
the 
workshops 

are attended by up to 20 
representatives from different 
student 
organizations, 

Kennedy said BICE attempts 
to keep its scenarios general 
and practical enough to be 
applicable to everyone.

“We try to make (mock 

scenarios) 
as 
specific 
as 

possible to the communities 
we work with, and try talking 
about scenarios that maybe 
happened at their last house 
party, or something they see in 
their meetings,” Kennedy said. 
“We try to keep the scenarios 
pretty general, but we hope 

that they can feel very real and 
be situations that students can 
actually find themselves in.”

Zorfass 
also 
emphasized 

because this is only a pilot 
program, student feedback is 
very important to the group.

“One 
of 
the 
committees 

within 
the 
Bystander 

intervention and Community 
Engagement program has been 
tasked with going through 
data 
(from 
feedback 
forms 

and 
surveys) 
and 
making 

their 
own 
evaluations 
and 

recommendations 
going 

forward,” Zorfass said.

LSA sophomore Ellen Paquet 

hasn’t partaken it the program 
yet, but praised it all the same. 
She said it’s very important 
to 
reach 
upperclassmen 
as 

well as freshmen, as training 
of this nature needs constant 
reinforcement 
to 
make 
an 

impact.

“I think there’s definitely 

validity 
in 
this 
program- 

though everyone has to attend 
freshman year, there are still 
some people who don’t and 
it’s unfortunately the sort of 
training that does wear off, 
especially because you’re going 
through 
so 
many 
changes 

freshman year and you’re being 
thrown into this completely 
different culture.” Paquet said. 
“It’s easy to forget the skills that 
you’ve gained from these types 
of workshops and interventions. 
I like that they’re finding new 
ways to ensure that people get 
adequate training in order to 
make the school safer and more 
welcoming overall.”

D

emocracies 
need 

protections for political 
minorities; 
without 

them, 
society 

descends 
into 

mob 
rule. 
These 

protections 
are 

often 
formalized 

(e.g., the filibuster), 
but 
they’re 
also 

informally 
written 

into our legislatures’ 
codes 
of 
conduct. 

Compromise 
is 
essential 
to 

any 
functioning 

democracy. But with Trump, 
it’s a little bit different (just like 
everything with him is). 

The 
fundamental 
problem 

with negotiating with Trump is 
that he’s coming from such an 
extreme position that tactics to 
move him more to the center just 
leave you with a normal hardline 
position, rather than a moderate 
one. Consider Trump’s travel 
ban. Its initial implementation 
was an unmitigated disaster. 
Families were stranded in limbo 
at airports. Iraqi interpreters 
who risked their lives for a 
country they’d never been to were 
rejected at our border. There 
were no exemptions for travelers 
with green cards, which stranded 
international 
students 
from 

universities across the country. 
The order’s instructions to allow 
for expedited entry to Christians 
revealed its plainly Islamophobic 
nature. The ban was ultimately 
frozen by a federal court.

The newest iteration of Trump’s 

ban removed Iraqis from teh ban, 
gave a 10-day warning before 
its implementation, allowed for 
green-card holders to enter the 
country and got rid of the religious 
exemptions.

In 
behavioral 
economics, 

there’s a concept called price 
anchoring, wherein your initial 
valuation of something acts as 
a reference point for all future 
valuations. For instance, if the 
first time you see a piece of 
jewelry and it costs $100, then 
you buy it a week later for $50, it’ll 
seem like a massive saving, even if 
the piece is typically only valued 
at $50.

The Trump administration’s 

new travel ban gets rid of the 
most egregious elements of the 

previous 
iteration, 

which, to the average 
observer, may make 
it seem much more 
reasonable. 
Never 

mind the fact that the 
executive 
order 
still 

prevents 
citizens 
of 

six 
Muslim-majority 

countries from entering 
the United States or 
Rudy Giuliani’s account 

of the first Muslim ban’s 

formulation: “(Trump) called me 
up, he said, ‘Put a commission 
together, show me the right way 
to do it legally.’ ” In comparison, 
this order may seem much more 
reasonable than the previous one, 
which may limit public outrage. 
We can’t evaluate Trump in 
comparison to his hardline agenda 
but rather have to understand his 
policies as atomized units.

This lens is also useful to look 

at Trump’s comments about 
the mainstream media. Take 
the average citizen who doesn’t 
trust Trump or the media very 
much. When Trump claims that 
they’re full of lies, someone may 
think that is taking it too far 
and instead opt to take a middle 
position where some of what 
the media says is a lie, or, since 
the media can never capture the 
full truth, everything they say is 
a half-truth. Most journalistic 
outfits have a well-documented 
slight 
bend 
toward 
the 

Democratic Party, but criticizing 
their integrity is taking things 
too far. While being moderate 
and 
judicious 
is 
frequently 

valorized, taking the middle-
ground on the media’s honesty 
or Trump’s discriminatory travel 
ban is a dangerous game to play 
because the fundamental ideas 
themselves are so wrong.

Trump is also willing to 

leverage 
the 
extremeness 
of 

his policy stances to implement 
policies outside of the traditional 
Republican toolbox. A useful 
historical analog for this is Nixon’s 
détente policy with China. It took 
an avowed anti-Communist to 
open the door to negotiations with 

Communist China. If someone 
with weaker bona fides had gone, 
they may have been accused of 
being a communist sympathizer 
rather than a brilliant tactician.

Trump’s 
reputation 
as 
a 

successful 
businessman 
could 

make him the only person who 
can directly put pressure on 
companies to keep their jobs 
in the United States. If Obama 
had done the same, he may have 
been accused of interfering with 
the free market. The exact same 
thing is beginning to happen with 
Trump’s immigration policies. 
When he talks about creating 
comprehensive 
immigration 

reform, people normally against 
it will likely fall in line behind 
it, because Trump has been so 
anti-immigrant in the past. In 
other words, it takes someone 
who has spent almost two years 
denigrating Mexican immigrants 
to fix our failing immigration 
system. This last example is 
likely also driven by the previously 
discussed phenomenon of price-
anchoring. If Trump does enact 
immigration reform, it’ll be in the 
context of his wall and hardline 
approach to immigrants, so any 
policy he proposes will seem 
comparatively less noxious.

Maybe this all seems like a 

stretch since so much of the 
White House seems to be driven 
by sheer incompetence (see: 
Kellyanne Conway’s claims that 
Obama could spy on Trump using 
his microwave), but I don’t think 
that’s a helpful frame. Ascribing 
actions to idiocy means that they 
can’t be countered. This strategy 
of negotiating from extremes is a 
proven one and has benefited far-
right parties in Europe. Poland’s 
Law and Justice party was able 
to further universal health care 
using these tactics and shored 
up their electoral weaknesses, 
winning the largest electoral 
victory in Poland’s democratic 
history. As citizens, we have to 
resist the temptation for false 
equanimity, lest we let the far-
right continue to control the 
United States.

W

ithin the fortified 
liberal bastion that 
is Ann Arbor, there 

exists an environment 
uniquely 
designed 
for 

the progressive students 
who populate campus. 
Here, the most liberal of 
beliefs can be resounded 
within Ann Arbor’s echo 
chamber that makes this 
town in the midwestern 
United 
States 
sound 

more like a socialist 
paradise in Scandinavia. 

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
liberal 

student body is readily 
known worldwide to the point 
that our left-leaning bias is 
often capitalized on by the 
conservative media and punditry 
as a ridiculous example of a 
public university run amok, 
both stifling freedom of speech 
and coddling its weak students.

Yet a large majority of students 

here feel pride in these common 
progressive 
values, 
and 
as 

President Mark Schlissel said 
following the electoral victory of 
Donald Trump, “Ninety percent of 
you rejected the kind of hate and 
the fractiousness and the longing 
for some sort of idealized version 
of a nonexistent yesterday.”

And 
those 
results 
of 
the 

2016 election served to further 
entrench 
and 
solidify 
such 

progressive beliefs. The liberal 
values discovered, discussed and 
debated among students within 
the lecture halls, study lounges 
and dormitories of the University 
became essential to promote now 
more than ever.

As someone who considers 

himself a member of this educated 
and informed liberal class of 
University students, I, like many 
others, value and attempt to 
promote progressive beliefs that 
are essential to move U.S. society 
towards becoming more inclusive, 
equal and advantageous.

Yet within this demographic 

of openly progressive students 
there exists a large majority of 
financially 
well-off, 
primarily 

white students who live within a 
reality in which economic, racial 
and social strife are never truly 
experienced. There exists a large 
segment of smug liberals who 
bathe in their proclaimed self-
righteousness, dedicating the bare 
minimum of activism toward the 
political values they will so readily 

scream about through Twitter on 
a brand-new iPhone 7.

The University ranks last in 

economic mobility 
and 
diversity 

among 
public 

universities, 
touting a median 
family income of 
$154,000 
(almost 

$100,000 
more 

than the national 
median) 
and 
an 

ethnic makeup that 
is 
predominantly 

white. 
Surrounded 
by 

students of similar 

socioeconomic backgrounds, this 
white wealthy liberal culture often 
feels free to dominate the political 
environment of the University.

Many students rail against 

Betsy DeVos and her policies 
advocating for school choice, yet 
hail from expensive private or 
well-funded public schools. Many 
students so easily paint Americans 
who support the president’s travel 
ban as racist and xenophobic, but 
do not come even remotely close 
to providing actual donations to 
those refugees in need. And how 
casually many students can throw 
around terms such as inner-city, 
discrimination and Islamophobia 
without realizing the true harsh 
reality of life on the receiving end 
of those terms.

This current reality in which 

well-educated, financially sound, 
predominantly 
white 
liberal 

students 
so 
enthusiastically 

hijack the political discussion 
concerning 
race, 
economics, 

foreign policy and social issues 
is just another example of the 
privilege bestowed and granted 
upon them for the simple reason 
that they were born to a certain 
family at the right time. 

And I know all of this for I am 

a part of this pathetic subgroup 
of 
pseudo-intellectuals 
who 

scream about raising taxes and 
the minimum wage, yet are 
completely financially dependent 
on their parents. I am part of 
these modern-day patriots who 
heroically 
defend 
progressive 

ideals during work hours — yet 
go home to our comfortable 
lives 
in 
paid-off 
apartments, 

with 
Moleskine 
notebooks, 

personalized Apple electronics, $5 
lattes and Ralph Lauren sneakers.

Buffered by our socioeconomic 

statuses, we are nearly unaffected 

by the real ramifications of 
poverty, racism and our great fear 
of the Trump administration. We 
dive back into the numerous left-
leaning newspapers, podcasts and 
books that have a profound effect of 
flattering our intelligence and lead 
us to believe that we’re actually 
doing something to help. We 
bounce the same outrage off one 
another, amplifying our unaffected 
white voices to an authoritative 
tone that we should fix this, then 
proceed to simply go on with our 
comfortable lives, drinking at the 
bar, seeing a band and smiling ever 
so smugly that knowing we’re on 
the right side of history.

Guilty 
of 
our 
abstract 

indifference 
to 
the 
reality 

playing out in front of us, we 
must recognize our lack of self-
awareness, realizing that there is a 
serious necessity for some greater 
form of participation. Benefiting 
from comfortable family and 
socioeconomic positions, it is not 
nearly enough to complain and 
inform ourselves over the issues 
we so emotionally care about. The 
smug level of liberalism we share 
needs to be infused with actual 
activism and empathy.

“Tweets 
are 
not 
The 

Resistance.” Millions across this 
country are motivated now more 
than ever to uphold the values 
we so readily strap ourselves to. 
Join several activist sites such 
as ResistanceRecess.com, which 
lists congressional town halls to 
hold your congressional leaders 
accountable, 
or 
Flippable.org, 

which informs subscribers of 
essential down-ballot races that 
have the possibility of changing 
parties. There are also multiple 
political organization on campus 
such as Progressives University 
of Michigan or the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
who often host events and are 
simple to join.

These smug emotions that 

are common with white wealthy 
liberals need to be shed. There 
is no way to build a resistance or 
a future country for that matter 
around an expensive education 
and a subscription to The New 
York Times.

Actions speak louder than 

words, even the multisyllabic 
ones we use to describe the fly-
over states.

“N

one of us were 
prepared for this.” 
These are the words 

I spoke while on the phone with 
a reporter from the Wall Street 
Journal after the surprise victory of 
our now-president. As the founder 
of a new student organization 
that directly works with and 
advocates for refugees — Michigan 
Refugee Assistance Program — I 
knew my organization and the 
students involved were going to 
be devastated because refugee 
resettlement would soon cease. I 
thought about the refugees who 
went to school here; my family 
in the Middle East; what would 
become of my student organization, 
which was only a couple months 
old; and the minority students on 
campus who now had vindication 
that, no, they were not wanted in 
this country.

Two weeks later, I sat again 

at 
an 
award 
ceremony 
and 

listened to University of Michigan 
administrators 
talk 
about 
the 

University. They commended our 
campus for being one that upholds 
values of inclusivity and tolerance, 
and stated that, for many, the 
University is a refuge, and they would 
fight to keep it that way. That is when 
I knew how critical this Central 
Student Government election was.

I knew we needed individuals 

who not only stated that they could 
make change on campus, but also 
have the track record to prove it. 
I knew we needed individuals to 
who took seriously the position 
they found themselves in and used 
it for the betterment of all students 
on campus. And last, I knew that 
we needed individuals who have 
established themselves time and 
time again as student leaders. That 
is why I am voting for Anushka 
Sarkar and Nadine Jawad, and the 
rest of the eMerge party, who are 
by far the best choice in this year’s 
CSG elections.

Anushka, a woman I admire 

for her tenacity and gracefulness 
while simultaneously being one of 
the most professional individuals 
I know, is able to tackle problems 
with a comprehensive framework 
and eye for detail. Nadine, one 
of the most involved students on 
campus, embodies the meaning of 

ally and advocate as she continually 
uses her positions on campus to 
work to lift up others. They are the 
only individuals qualified for CSG 
president and vice president — I 
know this because I have seen what 
they are capable of accomplishing. 
Furthermore, as a student who has 
seen the tangible impacts of CSG 
and its initiatives, I do not believe 
it is a logical choice to demarcate 
two of the most powerful positions 
on campus to those who have no 
experience to handle the difficult 
problems that Anushka and Nadine 
have already handled.

Six months ago, I founded 

MRAP and began to build it 
from the ground up. During the 
beginning stages of this process, 
I knew I needed experience from 
someone who had started their own 
non-governmental 
organization 

and immediately turned to Nadine 
for help and guidance. With 
amazing organizational ability and 
an individual who takes initiative 
when she sees gaps, Nadine, even 
as co-founder of her own NGO, 
Books for a Benefit, took the time 
to help build the infrastructure of 
my organization. As the current 
senior policy adviser for CSG, she 
has worked to address problems 
such as affordable housing in Ann 
Arbor while also attempting to 
use her platform to increase the 
voices of marginalized students 
on campus. The Michigan Daily 
rightly recognized her as a Student 
of the Year for her ceaseless 
advocacy, and rightly so — always 
ready to spend the little time she 
has helping others, Nadine’s love 
for service and constant activism 
is emblematic of what a CSG vice 
president should be. 

When it comes to experience, 

not only has Anushka scratched 
the surface of complex problems 
faced by students at the University 
— she has actually addressed them 
copiously. As the previous chief 
programming officer for CSG, 
she was faced with two recurring 
problems at the University: lack 
of counselors at Counseling and 
Psycological Services and lack of 
retention in student organizations. 
Anushka 
immediately 
took 

initiative and created innovative 
solutions 
to 
these 
concerns. 

Knowing the critical importance 
of having mental health resources 
in a timely fashion, Anushka 
succeeded 
in 
increasing 
the 

number of counselors at CAPS for 
every student on campus and has 
continued to work on this issue 
with unprecedented haste, as she 
understands the magnitude of this 
issue. She also created Wolverine 
Consulting Group to combat issues 
of member retention in student 
organizations. 
Her 
consulting 

group has been integral in assisting 
my new student organization, 
as well as so many others, in 
improving them and ensuring their 
sustainability for years to come. 

Anushka and Nadine do not 

need endorsements of any kind — 
their work on campus speaks for 
itself. They are busy working with 
and for students, as they always 
have been for their past three years 
on campus and will continue to 
serve the student body ceaselessly 
if they are elected as our new CSG 
president and vice president.

And while some may say they 

can get the job done, Anushka 
and Nadine already have, and 
their work started long before 
any of them set their sights on 
a CSG ticket. They are the only 
candidates with the experience, 
knowledge and tenacity to take 
on two incredibly important 
roles that will shape the future 
trajectory of our University — 
two roles we cannot risk giving 
to individuals inexperienced 
and unprepared.

A vote for Anushka, Nadine and 

the rest of the eMerge party is a 
vote not only for candidates with 
capability, a vote for candidates 
with the evidence to back up their 
claims or a vote for candidates that 
truly understand what it takes to 
address complex problems because 
they have previously done so — 
it is a vote for a better future, a 
better University, a university that 
we love and for which we should 
only entrust to the best. The best 
for this election is none other 
than Anushka Sarkar and Nadine 
Jawad, two individuals I am proud 
to stand with and honored to vote 
for in this upcoming election.

Why I am voting for eMerge

‘Beauty and the Beast’ 
is magical and relevant

WALT DISNEY

Emma Watson stars as Belle in Disney’s ‘Beauty an d the Beast.’

Disney brings classic fairytale to life and introduces a modern 
twist to the beloved tale of love loss, inner beauty and adventure

Magical is the first word 

that comes to mind when 
describing Disney’s latest live-
action princess movie remake. 
“Beauty 
and 
the 
Beast” 

captivates 
young 
audiences 

with its stunning effects and 
scenery while respecting the 
story adults know and love 
with a more nuanced punch 
than the original. The sets are 
incredible, from the bourgeois 
palace dripping with golden 
decadence to the tiny little 
village, bursting at the seams 
with boisterous bakers, frugal 
farmers 
and 
mini 
Marie 

Antoinettes. Alliteration aside, 
“Beauty and the Beast” brings 
every child’s storybook hero 
to life beyond the flatness of 
animation into the real-life 
fantasy of live-action.

Our story begins in France, 

at a “Phantom of the Opera” 
style masquerade, completely 
decked 
out 
with 
towering 

white 
wigs, 
extravagant 

gowns 
and 
Stanley 
Tucci 

(“Hunger Games”) playing the 
Harpsicord. We know what 
happens next: The handsome, 
selfish prince is turned into a 
monstrous beast by a sorceress 
who vows he will stay that 
way 
until 
he 

learns 
how 
to 

love 
another 

person. 
Days 

turn into years 
and 
the 
once 

lively, 
vibrant 

palace turns into 
a 
lonely, 
gray 

and 
decrepit 

wasteland. 
We 

then turn to Belle 
(the 
brilliant 

Emma 
Watson, 

“Harry Potter”), 
who 
wanders 

her little town 
in search of something less 
“provincial.” Belle’s beloved 
father 
Maurice, 
played 
by 

the always exceptional Kevin 
Kline 
(“The 
Big 
Chill”), 

takes off for the market but 
gets lost on his way, ending 
a tumultuous journey at the 
Beast’s 
abandoned 
castle. 

When Maurice’s horse returns 
to Belle alone, she takes charge 
and goes after her father, who 
has been taken captive by the 
Beast. In an act of fearlessness, 
Belle takes her father’s place as 
the Beast’s prisoner. While she 
is a prisoner, Belle never lets 
herself become a victim. She is 
strong-willed and poised, and 
has no problem saying “No.”

Belle 
befriends 
the 

household 
staff-turned-

magical 
objects 
whose 

performance of “Be Our Guest” 
is as mesmerizing as it is 
entertaining. The all-star cast 
of enchanted housewares put 
personality and style into their 

animated inanimate personas. 
Ewan McGregor’s (“Big Fish”) 
Lumiere and Ian McKellen’s 
(“Lord 
of 
the 
Rings”) 

Cogsworth 
are 
charming 

and full of clever 
banter. 
Also, 

Emma 
Thompson 

(“Love 
Actually”) 

is 
the 
perfect 

combination 
of 

stubborn 
and 

caring 
as 
Mrs. 

Pots. 
Slowly 
but 

surely, 
something 

that wasn’t there 
before 
begins 
to 

take place between 
Belle 
and 
the 

Beast. Dan Stevens (“Downton 
Abbey”) as the Beast is easy 
to anger, but intelligent and 
caring. The beastly friendship 
takes form over conversations 
about poetry and literature, 
bonding over similar tastes in 
table manners, and a hilarious 
snowball 
fight. 
Meanwhile, 

in the village, Luke Evans 
(“Dracula”) as Gaston and 
his trusted partner Le Fou 
(“Frozen” ’s Josh Gad), put 
on a delightful performance 
in the local pub. The scene 
is lively fun, complete with 
a tabletop tap number and 
Gad’s recognizable vocals that 
couldn’t help but evoke his 
animated alter ego, Olaf the 

snowman.

We all know 

how 
it 
ends; 

there is a dance 
(it’s 
stunning) 

and 
a 
fight 

(it’s scary) and 
suspense 
and 

tears 
and 
the 

final petal, and 
then 
happily 

ever after. While 
the story is easily 
summarized and 
not at all new, 
it still manages 
to 
absorb 
the 

audience. Belle is reminiscent of 
Disney’s original Princess, but 
more empowered than her 1991 
counterpart. Watson’s Belle is 
not simply the bookish daughter 
of a kooky inventor, rather 
an inventor in her own right. 
She is confident; not naive, 
complex, not simple. The Beast 
is not simply an angry loner, 
but a victim of bad parenting 
and high society. The Beast 
is brought to life even more 
with the computer graphics 
that make him, at times, more 
human than beast. Le Fou is 
not simply a blind follower of 
Gaston, but a man in love with 
a man in love with himself. Gad 
perfectly 
captures 
Disney’s 

first foray into representing a 
gay character on screen with 
his remarkable performance 
and subtle hints at his love 
for Gaston. As for Gaston, his 
character is the classic example 
of villainous incitement. He 
riles up the town to destroy 

anything that threatens their 
sameness.

Overall, “Beauty and the 

Beast” 
is 
an 
enchanting 

experience that will please 

children 
and 

adults 
alike. 

The 
film 
is 

able to capture 
the 
fantasy 

of 
the 
story, 

the whimsy of 
the 
cartoon, 

all 
the 
while 

addressing 
topics 
of 

empowerment, 
diversity 
and 

sexuality. 

“Beauty and the Beast” proves 
its worth as a tale as old as time, 
and it is certainly worth yours. 

‘Swimming’ stirs heavy 
questions within readers

Claire Fuller keeps readers on their toes in sophomore novel

Claire 
Fuller’s 
second 

novel, “Swimming Lessons,” 
begins with famous author Gil 
Coleman seeing his dead wife 
outside a bookstore. He follows 
her until she disappears, leaving 
him to wonder if it was actually 
her, or just a hallucination due 
to his age and failing health. 
Either way, Gil spends the rest 
of the book trying to catch up 
to her.

Ingrid had gone missing 

twelve years earlier, when her 
daughters, Flora and Nan, were 
still children. After swimming 
in the lake near their house 
everyday 
for 
years, 
Ingrid 

allegedly drowned one day. 
They never found her body.

After Gil takes a fall, he tells 

his daughters that he’s seen 
their mother. The older, more 
sensible Nan, now working as 
a nurse, doesn’t pay him any 
mind. But the rambunctious and 
bohemian 
younger 
daughter 

Flora seems to have always held 
onto the hope that her mother 
was alive. From the start, Gil 
and Flora have an optimistic 
hope regarding her mother’s 
disappearance that Nan does 
not. Following this hope, Flora 
and Nan move back into their 
father’s house to take care of 
him.

When Gil returns from that 

fateful day at the bookstore, 
the novel shifts form from the 
third person perspective of he 
and Flora’s narratives, to the 
epistolary first person narrative 
of Ingrid. Before disappearing, 
Ingrid hid letters to her husband 
in the multitudes of books that 
line the house like wallpaper. 
Ingrid adds insight to her 
letters through the books she 
chooses to hide them, whether 
it’s “The Great Gatsby” or “The 
Swimming Pool-Library.” It’s in 
the letters that the reader gets 
to know Ingrid, who despite her 

absence, is the most interesting 
and developed character of the 
book.

The different sections are 

marked not only by the forms, 
but also by the personalities of 
the characters. Flora’s chapters 
ground us in the present, but 
in her dreamy, open version 
of the present. In her endless 
belief that her mother could 
be alive, Flora epitomizes the 
danger of hope. For twelve 
years, she’s been tied to a 
ghost, an intangible mother 
figure constantly slipping away. 
Flora’s 
elusive 

hold on the reality 
felt 
by 
others 

manifests in her 
synesthesia, 
her 

ability to smell 
color.

The 
novel 

relies on Ingrid’s 
accounts of the 
past through her 
letters. By reading 
her urgent but ancient words, 
Ingrid comes alive to both the 
reader and to Gil. The letters 
follow a young Ingrid through 
her fall from grace into love 
with Gil, her professor at the 
time. We meet Gil, the real 
Gil, not the decrepit Gil of the 
present, who lectures fiercely 
and shares his beliefs about 
what it means to be a writer.

During one of their classes, 

Gil tells Ingrid and her peers: 
“Forget 
that 
first-edition, 

signed-by-the-author nonsense. 
Fiction is about readers. Without 
readers there is no point in 
books, and therefore they are 
as important as the author, 
perhaps more important. But 
often the only way to see what a 
reader thought, how they lived 
when they were reading, is to 
examine what they left behind.”

By weaving reader-response 

theory into a novel, Fuller 
forces the reader to examine 
how they’re interacting with 
the text, the character and the 
setting while they read. Through 

Gil, the impetus is placed upon 
the reader to truly interact, 
engage and find the nuance 
in each character and every 
choice made. As the letters and 
their relationship progresses, 
children are reluctantly born 
and things settle, and we begin 
to understand why Ingrid might 
have left, like Flora thinks.

In her letters, Ingrid defies 

all expectations and becomes 
a nuanced, complex woman. 
Ingrid 
preemptively 
begins 

her adult life with Gil, who is 
twenty years older than she 

is, 
marrying 

at 
twenty-one 

and 
starting 

her 
family. 

Fuller makes it 
incredibly easy to 
feel all of Ingrid’s 
aches 
— 
her 

dissatisfaction 
with her life, her 
hardships 
and 

displeasure with 

motherhood. Ingrid holds her 
family together, even in her 
absence, through the secrets 
and the conditional love she 
leaves in her wake.

Secrets and mystery, even 

more than the dysfunction 
of the family, prove to be 
the backbone of “Swimming 
Lessons.” The impulsive and 
selfish actions of the characters 
sometimes seem odd, until 
the value system of the world 
is recognized. In “Swimming 
Lessons,” to have a secret or to 
have an experience to yourself, 
is to have power. It is to have a 
story. Gil himself at one point 
explains the prioritization that 
drives the novel.

“Secret truths ... are the 

lifeblood of a writer,” Gil says. 
“Your memories and your own 
secrets. Forget plot, character, 
structure; if you’re going to 
call yourself a writer, you need 
to stick your hand in the mire 
up to the wrist, the elbow, the 
shoulder and drag out your 
darkest, most private truth.”

FILM REVIEW


6A — Monday, March 20, 2017
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“I’m taking far too many 

chances / On these less than 
idealistic romances.”

Nobody would have picked the 

scrappy Welsh band with cutesy 
matching last names and gleefully 
overwrought song titles to secretly 
become one of the best bands of its 
generation, but I don’t think even 
Los Campesinos! themselves ever 
expected to survive their own 
brief moment. Their first full-
length, Hold On Now, Youngster, is 
where you can find this line, from 
a track titled “Broken Heartbeats 
Sound Like Breakbeats.”

(If you don’t like that song 

title, I probably shouldn’t tell you 
about “This Is How You Spell 
‘HAHAHA, We Destroyed the 
Hopes and Dreams of a Generation 
of Faux-Romantics.’ ”)

Already on 2008’s Youngster, 

the Campesinos! — yes, all 11 
members, past and present, have 
taken that last name — were 
already recording like they’d never 
get another shot at an album. On 
“Breakbeats” alone, the opening 
count-off is shrieked by every 
band member, Aleks Campesinos! 
gets a line in about Spider-Man in 
the chorus, and bandleader Gareth 
sings at least some of his lyrics like 
he’s trying to imitate the tortured 
wailing of the old Internet dial-up 
sound.

The 
songcraft 
of 
Los 

Campesinos! has always been 
less than idealistic, less than 
commercially 
viable. 
These 

songs are filled with obscure 
lyrical 
references, 
too 
many 

instruments, multiple lead singers 
and catchy hooks buried under 
breakneck tempos played by 
overactive musicians. This is not a 
band criminally deprived of fame. 
This is an underdog band that has 
taken aim at a very specific kind 
of listener — one that’s awkward 
and anxious, but loves to dance 
and shout their feelings — and hit 
them square in the heart.

“We’re undeveloped, we’re 

ignorant, we’re stupid, but 
we’re happy.”

This is probably the one you 

know. Well, you probably don’t 
know the lyric, because Gareth 
stuffs it into a mile-a-minute rant 
at the end of the song, quietly 
slipping it underneath the final 
chorus amid lines comparing 
supermarkets to discotheques. 
But you might know the slow, 
opening guitar build-up to this 
seven-minute opus from the 
debut album. I think it was in 
a beer commercial once, which 
makes it LC’s most-heard song by 
a longshot.

“You! 
Me! 
Dancing!” 

crystallized Los Campesinos! as 
part of something called “blog 
rock,” which basically came about 
when MySpace was still a thing 
and everyone was excited rather 
than horrified at the unlimited 
possibilities of the World Wide 
Web. It was the first time bands 
didn’t need a label to distribute 
music, and it gave a lot of left-field 
bands 15 minutes of fame.

Most blog rock outfits were 

overhyped and faded away after 
an album or two, but LC! have 
held on for dear life. Listen to the 
debut, and they’re just as jittery 
and smart-alecky as all their peers, 
but this line from “Dancing!” 
completely undersells the band. 
Lurking 
underneath 
all 
the 

distracting frills, soon to emerge, 
are beautiful anthems.

“I identify my star sign / By 

asking which is least compatible 
with yours”

By the next album, Gareth and 

the band seemed smarter, more 
developed, but unhappy. This 
comes off the opening track to 
Youngster’s follow-up, “We are 
Beautiful, We Are Doomed,” and 
it’s the best way to say “fuck you” 
I’ve ever heard.

Albums two and three in the 

Campesinos! catalog are pricklier 
than the youthful, instrument-
inclusive debut. They’re made for 
catharsis rather than dancing, 
dense with guitar noise and 
emotion while trying once again 
to obscure catchy hooks and 

choruses. “Shout at the world, 
because the world doesn’t love 
you,” goes one indicative line.

They’re also the albums where 

Gareth solidifies his persona as a 
songwriter. He’s unlucky in love, 
either because he’s too obstinate 
or too clingy in relationships. 
He’s constantly worried about 
the future. He suffers no fools. He 
believes his break-ups should be 
front-page worthy tragedies. Aleks 
is always there to counterpoint, 
though: “You think you’re the 
needle that drains the blood 
donation / You’re just a repetition 
on an old, worn out pin cushion,” 
is so bizarre and brilliant it could 
only come from the Campesinos!.

“Here it comes / This is the 

crux / She vomits down my 
rental tux.”

But 
if 
Gareth 
swaggered 

around 
every 
song 
like 
a 

misanthropic wanker, LC! would 
be borderline unlistenable. Thank 
Morrissey he’s got a sense of 
humor too, one that continually 
allows him to narrate himself into 
memorably hilarious situations.

“I’ve spent too much time on 

my knees / Next to urinals in 
garish Mexican restaurants / 
Sobbing into my warm, pale palms 
/ For a better understanding 
of my dietary requirements,” 
he 
shamelessly 
admits 
on 

“Miserabilia.”

Even better, on “By Your 

Hand,” he imagines an entire 
hook-up with Fate, personified 
as the prettiest girl in the world. 
They kiss for hours, and her hand 
is down Gareth’s trousers when 
she invites him back to her place.

“But here it comes, this is the 

crux,” he sings. “She vomits down 
my rental tux.”

In a review of the new 

Campesinos!, 
Sick 
Scenes, 

Pitchfork editor Ryan Dombal 
called Gareth Campesinos! “our 
bard of throwing up.” He writes, 
“Nearly every word that has 
come out of the Los Campesinos! 
singer’s mouth has presented 
itself 
with 
rash 
inelegance, 

candidness and the need to be 
ejected from his body this very 
second.”

That is entirely the appeal 

of this quixotic band. Gareth 
cannot contain himself, and these 
odd, ultra-specific feelings that 
get spewed out over the course 
of every Campesinos! album 
somehow look the same as a 
lot of other people’s inner guts. 
He’s failed to digest all of his 
own experiences and throws 
them back out through his art, 
and what do you know — his 
misfortune makes a lot of fans feel 
less alone in their own awkward 
everyday screw-ups and missed 
opportunities.

The best icebreaker I’ve ever 

been a part of is, “When was the 
last time you threw up?” That’s 
how you learn about a person; 
that’s how you hear the best 
stories.

What I’m trying to say is, 

everybody pukes. Gareth is just 
the one who writes all about it.

“They promised they’d be 

best of friends from now until 
forever / But both were far too 
needy not to fall for the other.”

No Campesinos! song has 

fascinated 
me 
more 
than 

*inhales* “A Heat Rash in the 
Shape of the Show Me State; or, 
Letters from Me to Charlotte.” 
For the record, I don’t think it has 
anything to do with a relationship 
between Gareth and Aleks, but 
no song better illustrates their 
chemistry.

“Heat Rash” is a quieter, 

meditative 
song 
about 
a 

tempestuous couple. It’s still a 
Campesinos! song, so you’ll hear 
the word “erection” when you 
listen, but unlike the overflowing 
drama of most of their songs, 
this one is more restrained and 
thought-through, open to many 
interpretations. The voices of 
dual-singers Gareth and Aleks 
mix perfectly here, with Gareth 
taking the narrative verses with 
his usual directness and Aleks 
hitting notes of longing on the 
more ambiguous chorus.

Unfortunately, Aleks left after 

three 
albums, 
which 
makes 

releases four and five a little less 
dynamic. She was the best foil 

Gareth could have asked for, and 
the loss of her presence is naturally 
a little tough to adjust to.

“Renato Dall’Ara, living off 

2008 / Renato Dall’Ara, once up 
then back down again.”

I don’t think I can understate 

how miraculous it is that this band 
is still making albums. Indie rock 
is not a viable business anymore, 
unless you’re doing arenas like 
Arcade Fire or banging out 
afternoon sets at every festival 
that calls. Los Campesinos! is not 
a stable endeavor, and they rely 
on their hardcore fans more than 
a major-label pop star ever could.

This line, off the opening track 

of Sick Scenes, is one of many 
obscure (for Americans) soccer 
references you’ll find throughout 
the Campesinos’ work, but there’s 
some pretty clear double meaning 
here, with 2008 also being the 
release of Hold On Now, Youngster. 
Gareth has said, too, the “once up 
then back down again” line refers 
to how, in the music industry, “you 
play a venue once on the way up 
and once on the way back down.”

But if Sick Scenes is Los 

Campesinos! on the way back 
down, it’s a return to form and a 
fantastic way to bottom out. After 
two solid albums, this sixth effort 
is their most exciting in years, filled 
once more with weirdly danceable 
arrangements and easily quotable 
lines. In the very first verse of this 
track, Gareth snidely cuts at a self-
professed Marxist reading by his 
parents’ pool. (“It’s only outdoor 
and it isn’t heated.”)

Sick Scenes is mature yet fun 

and everything else you could 
ask for from a veteran band, and 
it’s hard not to wish that Los 
Campesinos! had received more 
public attention when you listen. 
It’s hard to tell if this new release is 
an artistic resurgence or a proper 
finale for a group that by all odds 
should have been dead eight years 
ago, but more than anything it just 
makes me hope that these albums 
survive long enough to influence 
another young, up-and-coming 
band — one who can shine a light 
on all these should-be classics.

“We are beautiful / We are 

doomed.”

This is the one. This line, the 

titular culmination of my absolute 
favorite song, is why I needed to 
write so many words about these 
Welsh would-be deities. It starts 
with four staccato synth notes that 
roll into a repeating melody. There 
are strings and a glockenspiel 
along with the guitars. It’s epic.

Gareth isn’t rapping, but he’s 

sort of speak-singing as fast as 
he can, ranting at you about the 
slow dissolving of his relationship 
and that time he ate too many 
crisps and threw up while playing 
soccer. He slows down for this 
gutwrenchingly 
honest 
line: 

“You feel terrified at the thought 
of being left behind / Of losing 
everybody, the necessity of dying.” 
Then he turns up the shouting 
for this classic quote: “Oh, we kid 
ourselves there’s future in the 
fucking / But there is no fucking 
future.”

Gareth is angry and jealous and 

lost. He’s working out strategies 
to keep from being heartbroken 
but finds himself outmaneuvered 
every time. The last quote from 
him I’ll write out is the climax, in 
its entirety:

“I cannot emphasis enough 

that my body / Is a badly designed, 
poorly 
put-together 
vessel 
/ 

Harboring 
these 
diminishing, 

so-called vital organs / I hope 
my heart goes first. I HOPE MY 
HEART GOES FIRST!”

Los Campesinos! is a band that’s 

always ready to die, but thrilled to 
have lived and loved. They couldn’t 
control the volume of their voices, 
the number of instruments they 
let into the mix or the intensity of 
detail in all their embarrassing 
anecdotes. They’ve spent a decade 
reaching out from Wales to the rest 
of the world, looking for pissed-off 
romantics who’d always be up and 
then back down again. They’ve 
touched a very specific subset that 
likes erudite soccer references and 
awkward, inclusive dancing in 
equal measure. They’ve inspired at 
least one case of extreme devotion. 
They’ve always been doomed to 
fail. They’ve always been beautiful.

A lyrical guide to indie 
rock’s best-kept secret 

‘We’re undeveloped, we’re ignorant, we’re stupid, but we’re happy.’

NBC

NBC’s new comedy “Trial & Error”
Silly crime spoof ‘Trial & 
Error’ surprising delight

Theoretically, 
a 
show 
like 

NBC’s “Trial & Error” shouldn’t 
work. Given its single-camera, 
mockumentary-style storytelling 
and silly humor, “Trial & Error” 
sounds like one of those typical, 
offbeat cookie-cutter sitcoms that 
attempts to mirror previously 
successful comedies like “The 
Office” and “Parks & Recreation.” 
However, “Trial & Error” subverts 
the “formulaic comedy” trope 
with a talented cast, hysterical 
one-liners and a premise that is as 
wacky as it is clever. 

Though it’s not necessarily 

thought-provoking or complex, 
“Trial & Error” is nevertheless 
a genuinely funny, sometimes 
touching show that pokes fun at the 
criminal justice system and masks 
the grittiness of crime TV with 
gleeful absurdity.

While the majority of characters 

are portrayed as dumb, each of the 
actors imbue their roles with wit, 
delivering the whip-smart dialogue 
with ease and adept comedic 
timing. Nick D’Agosto (“Gotham”) 
leads the band of cast members as 
the tirelessly optimistic attorney 
Josh Segal, who travels from 
New York to East Peck, South 
Carolina to defend eccentric poetry 
professor Larry Henderson (John 
Lithgow, “The Crown”). Having 
played mostly supporting roles, 
D’Agosto does an admirable job as 
the lead character, but it’s Lithgow, 
at his kookiest and funniest, who 
fuels most of the show’s humor, 

channeling a nervous energy in his 
character’s desperation without 
coming off as pitiful or plain stupid. 

With the help of the lead 

investigator Dwayne Reed (Steven 
Boyer, “The Wolf of Wall Street”), 
the 
maladie-ridden 
secretary 

Anne Flatch (Sherri Shepherd, “30 
Rock”) and Larry’s 
daughter Summer 
(Krysta Rodriguez, 
“Smash”), 
Josh 

is 
tasked 
with 

developing 
a 

compelling 
case 

for 
Larry, 
who 

was 
accused 
of 

murdering his wife 
Margaret. Despite the menace of 
the case’s cut-throat prosecutor 
Carol Anne Keane (Jayma Mays, 
“Glee”), the steadfast Segal and his 
slightly incompetent team do their 
best to fight for Larry’s innocence, 
even when the odds are stacked 
against them, such as when two 
breaking 
news 
stories 
reveal 

Larry’s affair with another man 
and the murder of his first wife.

These events prompt outrage 

from the community, but also 
spark 
some 
darkly 
amusing 

antics from Josh’s team. Guest 
star Andy Daly (“Review”) plays 
forensic investigator Thom Hinkle, 
who helps Josh find evidence in 
Larry’s defense, despite having 
an 
obsessive 
compulsion 
to 

masturbate in highly stressful 
situations. 
Shepherd, 
whose 

performance is more outlandish 
and much tamer than her previous 
comedic outings, gives Anne an off-
kilter, if somewhat deranged edge. 
Her character suffers from facial 

amnesia, dyslexia and Stendahl’s 
syndrome, which causes her to 
faint every time she observes 
something beautiful. It’s possible 
that these kind of odd quirks can 
become annoying the more they are 
referenced, but they are also what 
make “Trial & Error” surprisingly 

entertaining, 
strange 
and 

humorous.

Along with the 

brilliant 
casting 

and writing, “Trial 
& Error” utilizes 
its 
Southern 

setting 
effectively 

as well. Being a 

Northeasterner, Josh is a fish out of 
water who has trouble acclimating 
to the South’s culture. In one 
particularly funny sequence, the 
courthouse 
security 
mistakes 

Josh’s “lip balm” for an actual bomb, 
but lets Carol Anne through with 
a gun. Later on, he has difficulty 
in pronouncing Carol Anne’s and 
the Judge Horsedich’s names, 
despite the fact that the correct 
pronunciation of both characters’ 
names are impossible even for 
viewers to understand. It’s easy 
to play into the many stereotypes 
of the South, but “Trial & Error” 
highlights these little cultural 
tidbits as something casually funny 
rather than egregiously overt.

This show could’ve started out 

like the first few seasons of “Parks 
& Rec” and “The Office,” where 
the characters weren’t quite yet 
developed and the humor was too 
awkward and clumsy. Luckily, 
“Trial & Error” already seems to 
have found its footing.

2-Part Series 

Premiere

NBC

Tuesdays at 9 p.m.

Tracey Snelling opens up 
the life behind windows

When stepping into Tracey 

Snelling’s 
exhibit 
“Multiple 

Realities,” gallery-goers will 
find themselves immersed in 
countless “different sounds and 
languages” 
while 
absorbing 

the vibrant colors and various 
characteristics of, what Snelling 
refers to as the “shacks.”

One 
piece 
of 
her 
work 

which will be on display, “One 
Thousand Shacks,” is usually 
16-feet-tall 
by 
10-feet-wide, 

but will need to be split apart 
as the ceiling in the gallery 
space is too low. Composed of 
many substances and various 
mediums, Snelling built her 
work out of recycled materials.

Snelling created her work by 

“saving old boxes, food boxes, 
tin foil and a lot of plastic,” 
which plays on a critical theme 
of the work: Making do with 
what you have.

“I just had the image in my 

head: Wow. I had to do it,” 
Snelling said, referring to her 
inspiration for “One Thousand 
Shacks.”

During her travels through 

Mexico, 
Cuba 
and 
China, 

Snelling began to get an honest 
look at the “extreme global 
poverty,” both around the globe 
and in the US. With her new 
awareness 
and 
perspective 

came the image of “One 
Thousand Shacks.”

“I mean people are starving 

and very thin, and have no 

place to live,” Snelling said 
when recalling her experiences 
abroad. In her own work, 
Snelling illustrates the global 
devastation of poverty.

Despite the heavy subject 

matter, Snelling will display 
her work as she saw it: as an 
outsider.

“I realize that I am an 

outsider, I try to be neutral and 
just take things 
in 
and 
put 
it 

out; 
to 
not 
be 

judgmental,” she 
said.

As a result, the 

work 
does 
not 

focus 
solely 
on 

the struggles of 
poverty. Snelling 
recognized 
that 

while 
global 

poverty is one of 
our most plaguing 
and 
devastating 

issues, the people living in 
poverty are still living.

“These 
people 
are 
very 

resilient, a lot of people start 
businesses in the favelas or 
wherever 
they 
are 
living,” 

Snelling 
said. 
“There 
are 

kickboxing schools that they 
start, all sorts of different 
things.”

Snelling’s 
work 
is 

transparent, 
and 
every 

component 
matters. 
She 

encourages the audience to take 
a look behind the shacks to see 
how they are put together.

The shacks’ frames are made 

of wood while countless simple 
wires race along the walls to 

power miniature TVs and lights. 
Snelling explained that “the 
back is almost as important as 
the front because it shows that 
in a lot of these areas you just 
have to take what you have.”

Her exhibit will also contain 

a set of miniature store fronts 
and rooms. Some of these 
play off of stereotypes, social 
issues and other rooms that, 

to her, were just 
“intuitive,” such 
as 
the 
“disco-

party” room.

While 
some 

make statements 
on topics such as 
prostitution and 
feminism, others 
“subtly look at 
the social issues, 
not 
necessarily 

making 
a 

statement, 
but 

pointing out that 

there is an issue.” Snelling’s 
ability to jump into and out 
of 
troubling 
realities 
will 

lead to a socially intriguing, 
yet 
artistically 
beautiful 

experience for gallery-goers.

While Snelling’s passion for 

creating art is unmistakable, 
she also has a clear hunger to 
change the way people see the 
world.

“I 
would 
love 
if 
this 

influences anyone to donate 
money or do something to help 
with poverty, but on a bigger 
scale, I hope that my work 
opens people’s minds a little bit 
more to be more inclusive and 
accepting.”

Michigan 73, Louisville 69

2B — March 20, 2017
SportsMonday
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

For Michigan fans, a week to savor

W

hatever you do, don’t 
waste this week. 

For the next three-

plus days, 
Ann Arbor 
will be one 
of 16 cities 
across the 
United States 
that gets to 
experience 
the singular 
energy that 
accompanies 
a trip to the 
Sweet 16.

At 7:09 p.m. Thursday, the 

Michigan men’s basketball 
team will tip off in Kansas City, 
Mo., against Oregon. Perhaps 
some of you will venture to join 
them. Others will gather in bars, 
lounges and dorm rooms across 
campus to hold their collective 
breath for two hours and watch 
one of the great spectacles in 
sports.

But in many ways, the real 

prize of advancing to the Sweet 16 
will come before then.

Three trips in the last five years 

may have spoiled some Michigan 
fans enough into thinking these 
just happen. But the fact of 
the matter is, regardless of the 
outcome Thursday night, the 
Wolverines have given their fans 
a commodity that is hard to come 
by and easy to lose: hope.

Consider Monday, Tuesday, 

Wednesday 
and most of 
Thursday your 
time to dream. 
There will still 
be class and 
homework and 
plenty other 
things that are 
normally worth 
your attention. 
But not this 
week. This is a 
week to make 
the plans you’ll tell your future 
children about. It’s a week to 

watch “Survive and Advance,” or 
“Hoosiers,” or even “Cinderella” 

— if that’s not too 
on the nose.

The truth is, 

it doesn’t much 
matter whether 
you followed 
basketball this 
season. There 
are so few 
opportunities 
to be in college 
when your school 
makes it this 
far that, when it 

does, you owe it to yourselves to 
make the most of it.

Some ideas:
Spend your Monday basking 

in the feeling you had Sunday 
around 2:15. Take at least one 
class off and take a walk down 
to South Campus — see if the air 
feels just a little bit different.

On Tuesday you’ll want 

to read up. Oregon’s a damn 
good team and, come tip-off 
Thursday, you won’t want to 
be double-checking who the 
Ducks’ best player is (his name 
is Dillon Brooks) or, worse, who 
Michigan’s starters are. Talk to 
a friend — any friend — about 
the game. Sports mean bonding, 
and there are few better times to 

catch the fever.

Drink on Wednesday so you 

can take in Thursday’s tension 
without feeling the pull of 
Skeeps. It’s unorthodox, but 
trust me: It’ll pay off.

Thursday evening, you’ll 

want to gather with your 
closest friends for game time. 
It doesn’t necessarily matter 
where — some prefer to be out 
with the largest possible group, 
others prefer to watch in the 
comfort of a house — but the 
shared joy of a big shot is unlike 
nearly anything else you’ll ever 
experience.

I know this sounds cliché 

coming from a sports writer who 
you may or may not suspect is 
wistful for his days as a fan. And 
you’re sort of right — the day I 
was accepted to Michigan, Trey 
Burke hit “the shot” against 
Kansas in the Sweet 16. It was 
a crazy moment, and I’d love 
nothing more than for everyone 
to have a similar experience. 
This is the weekend when that 
can happen.

But there’s also something 

about the NCAA Tournament 
that goes beyond visceral, 
personal memories.

The energy on campus — 

both in class and on the Diag 

— cannot be replicated. The 
stage will rarely be bigger; the 
lights will rarely be brighter. 
The world will be talking about 
what’s happening in Ann Arbor, 
and, if you’re lucky, you may 
even get a sunny day.

Come tip-off Thursday, you 

owe it to yourselves to have 
enjoyed that feeling as long as 
possible.

It could be gone by Friday 

morning.

Introducing a new, improved Beilein

I

NDIANAPOLIS — John 
Beilein is having more fun 
than you.

Even for 

those who 
have known 
the 64-year-
old basketball 
coach for 
any amount 
of time, who 
could have 
imagined him 
firing a Super 
Soaker in the 
locker room 
for a post game celebration like 
a child who just unwrapped the 
same toy for Christmas?

That’s because the old, 

methodical, disciplinarian John 
Beilein ain’t around anymore.

Everyone, I’d like to introduce 

you to John Beilein 2.0.

This latest model of the 

Michigan basketball coach still 
has some of the features from the 
previous version you’ve grown to 
enjoy and love.

He still focuses on player 

development, still stresses the 
fundamentals and still acts 
like he’s a teacher first and a 
basketball coach second.

But as this season has gone 

on, Beilein has had less and 
less to worry about and do as a 
coach. And as it’s turned out, 
less has turned into more for the 
Wolverines.

“He’s enjoying this moment 

just like we are,” said senior 
guard Andrew Dakich. “It’s 
really cool to see our coach be so 
relaxed. He’s still the same guy, 
he’s just joking around a lot more 
and having more fun with us.”

More than any other team he’s 

managed, Beilein has loosened 
his control of the reigns at the 
helm of Michigan and given it to 
the assistant coaches and veteran 
players alongside him.

That started even before the 

season, when Beilein brought in 
assistant coaches Billy Donlon 
and Saddi Washington.

Specifically with Donlon, 

Beilein has come to view him as 
more than just an assistant as the 
season has unfolded. He’s given 

almost full control of the defense 
to Donlon and let him script a 
large part of the narrative of 
this season as it has unfolded, 
even allowing his assistant to 
vandalize a few walls in the 
process.

Whenever Michigan has 

needed an extra boost of 
motivation, or something out of 
the box, Donlon has stepped up 
to deliver that. For Michigan’s 
home game against Illinois, he 
penned “Streetfight” on the 
wall in the Crisler Center locker 
room. In Washington for the 
Wolverines’ Big Ten Tournament 
game against Purdue, he used 
that same sharpie to ink “Not 
today” on a Verizon Center wall, 
telling his players that it was 
not the day Michigan would be 

packing its bags and heading 
home.

Again on Sunday, Donlon 

was in charge of preaching the 
message of the game. He walked 
into the main area of the locker 
room with pictures of each 
players’ and coaches’ family, and 
taped them to the wall.

“Everyone had a picture with 

them and their family,” said 
senior wing Zak Irvin. “He said, 
‘When times get tough, think 
about them. Think about the 
people who you do it for.’ I think 
it really hit home for everybody 
and I think that really showed in 
the second half.”

Beilein’s faith in all of his 

assistants is higher than ever, 
and that has shown over this 
postseason run.

It’s not easy scouting and 

developing game plans in such 
a short turnaround time, and 
Michigan’s coaching staff has 
been doing a masterful job doing 
so over the past two weeks.

Beilein says his staff is more 

connected than ever. There are 
no egos in the room, everyone is 
focused on their individual role.

That dynamic also extends to 

how all the coaches interact with 
the players. Beilein says more 
than anything, his assistants 
have excelled at connecting with 
the players. The coaching staff 
has instilled a belief in their 
players that anything is possible 
moving forward, and without 
that belief, Michigan wouldn’t be 
winning these games.

“The trust has gone up 

because we’ve got a lot of juniors 
and seniors now who are really 
leading this team and playing 
good basketball,” said senior 
forward Sean Lonergan. “I think 
that’s taken some of the pressure 
off coach (Beilein) to always be 
that stricter coach because this 
is really turning into a player-to-
player accountable team instead 
of a coach-to-player accountable 
team. We’re holding each other 
accountable, which takes the 
pressure off of him a little bit.”

More than ever, the players 

are calling the shots for 
Michigan, especially in this 
postseason run. Senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. is now 
overriding Beilein’s offensive 
play calls from the sidelines 
multiple times a game. In 

timeout huddles, players 
are yelling at each other for 
motivation and to correct 
mistakes.

“At some point, they’ve gone 

beyond buying in, they’ve taken 
ownership,” said assistant coach 
Jeff Meyer. “We’re on the ride 
with them now. That’s the reality 
of it. They are running the 
Wolverine Express right now.”

Beilein is now focused on 

making longer-term adjustments 
based on the Wolverines’ 
strengths rather than getting 
knit-picky over every little 
mistake made.

That was on full display on 

Sunday, as Walton once again 
took leadership to coach one 
of his teammates through a 
situation Beilein would have in 
seasons past.

“Now you have guys yelling 

at each other for not doing 
their job,” Lonergan said. “You 
saw it today with Derrick after 
(sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner) scored a big bucket. He 
looked at Moe straight after as 
he was running down the floor 
and said, ‘I’m glad you scored but 
I need you to go down there and 
get a stop for us.’ You see things 
like that, you hear people in 
timeouts always yapping in each 
others’ ear.”

The players and coaching 

staff have come together to take 
the load off Beilein and create 
something special, and Beilein 
himself is turning into a new 
man. He’s loose. He’s relaxed. 
He’s fun.

It wasn’t a personal choice, 

but more so the result of his 
changing surroundings. After 
40-plus years of coaching, 
there aren’t very many ways 
to change other than by the 
unforeseen circumstances 
Beilein has had to address 
throughout the season.

But he’s changed nonetheless. 

And for this new John Beilein, 
there’s nothing else to focus on 
but a title.

Wolverines sweep Kent State

Thirty 
strikeouts. 
Fourteen 

innings pitched. No runs and only 
one hit allowed. It was nothing 
short of a monumental weekend 
for Michigan’s senior right-hander, 
Megan Betsa.

After earning her fourth career 

no-hitter Saturday, the ace showed 
no signs of slowing down in the 
circle Sunday afternoon, allowing 
a sole hit and underscoring the 
Michigan softball team’s standout 
home-opening weekend.

The 19th-ranked Wolverines 

(17-7-1) captured their first series 
sweep of the season (3-0) after 
collecting two more wins over 
Kent State (8-13) in a doubleheader 
Sunday at Alumni Field, with an 
11-3 run-rule victory followed 
by a 3-0 shutout. The weekend’s 
successes became all the more 
sweet when Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins — already the winningest 
softball coach of all time — netted 
her 1,500th coaching win from the 
day’s first slate.

“First of all, it just feels great 

being home with our home fans, 
that’s always fun,” said senior 
centerfielder 
Kelly 
Christner. 

“And I think we really did come 
together as a team this weekend. 
It was cold and there were a lot 
of other factors and variables that 
you can turn into negative things. 
But I think we stayed together and 
stayed positive, so it’s really great 
coming out with these wins.”

Though Saturday’s matchup was 

an offensive disappointment for the 
Wolverines — with just two hits on 
the day against the Golden Flashes 
— Michigan remedied its struggles 
at the plate in Sunday’s first game. 
The Wolverines cranked out 11 
runs on 11 hits from seven separate 
players, with eight RBI. 

Junior first baseman Aidan 

Falk proved herself essential, 
maintaining composure in high-
pressure situations throughout 
the day, posting five of Michigan’s 
eight RBI including a two-run 
double in both games.

The 
Wolverines’ 
ballooning 

offensive production in the first 
game of the day was a major 
break through for a team whose 
season so far has been marred by 
offensive woes, from stranding 
runners on base to staying too 
tight at the plate.

“I know how well these kids 

can hit, I watch them every day,” 
Hutchins said. “And they’ve been 
tight endlessly throughout the 
season … and it’s not working for 
us. So they really need to just relax 
and believe that their swings are 
good enough. And I thought we 
got better this weekend. I thought 
we were better.”

While Michigan ended up 

dominating the first game, Kent 
State got off to a dangerous start. 
In the top of the first frame, the 
Golden Flashes blasted a two-run 
homer, making junior right-hander 
Tera Blanco appear nervous and 
inconsistent in the circle.

However, 
the 
Wolverines 

quickly answered Kent State’s 
efforts. By the end of the first 
inning, Michigan had taken the 
lead, 6-2, and had already forced 
Golden Flashes’ starting right-
hander Madi Huck out of the 
game. 

An atypical fielding error by 

Christner in the top of the fourth 
gave Kent State the only other 
run it would see all day, with 
the Wolverines still maintaining 
an 8-3 lead. While Michigan 
committed just this one error 
in the game, the Golden Flashes 
struggled defensively, with five 
errors.

After a rocky first frame, Blanco 

posted a solid complete-game 
win, demonstrating composure 
as she struck out 10 batters while 
walking only one.

Though 
the 
Wolverines’ 

offensive production in the latter 
slate did not match the 11 runs in 
the first, Hutchins attributed this 
in part to Kent State right-hander 
Ronnie Ladines’ prowess in the 
circle. Ladines, who pitched the 
first game of the series as well, 
only allowed Michigan two hits 

Saturday and six Sunday.

“(Ladines) is outstanding, she’s 

good,” Hutchins said. “So we had 
to come up with a game plan to try 
to take away her best pitch.”

Ladines’ Sunday appearance 

started off as more of the same, 
giving Betsa a run for her money. 
The game was a pitcher’s duel 
from the onset, with Betsa and 
Ladines both posting 1-2-3 frames 
in the first inning. It wasn’t until 
the bottom of the second that 
either team recorded a hit, as 
Blanco broke the ice with a base 
hit, her only of the day.

Heading into the bottom of 

the fourth, Michigan was yet to 
put a run on the scoreboard, and 
Hutchins was not pleased. She 
held a team huddle that proved 
effective as the Wolverine offense 
finally put the pieces together, 
earning all three runs of the game 
in a single inning.

“We decided on a game plan (in 

the huddle) and they executed it,” 
Hutchins said. “Faith started it all 
off with that fantastic rope, and 
hitting is contagious. That gave us 
some confidence. Kelly had a great 
at-bat, swung well, and I think that 
confidence started to grow.”

With Canfield at second and 

Christner at first, Falk slammed 
a hard ball down the left-field 
line, earning a two run double, 
finally putting numbers on the 
scoreboard. Minutes later, senior 
shortstop Abby Ramirez drove 
in Michigan’s final run on a gap 
double, widening the lead to 3-0.

The 
home 
opening 
series 

was a big break through for 
the 
Wolverines, 
from 
seeing 

no losses, to consistency in the 
circle, to production at the plate. 
In Hutchins’ eyes, Michigan was 
successful in all areas because they 
kept it simple.

‘M’ takes doubleheader

Drew Lugbauer stepped up 

to the plate in the bottom of the 
ninth inning looking at game-
winning runs on second and 
third base with two outs. The 
junior had gone 0-for-4 so far, 
but with the game on the line, 
Lugbauer had a chance to save 
his day. With a full count, he did 
just that, launching the ball over 
the right-field wall for a walk-off 
three-run home run.

The No. 21 Michigan baseball 

team (15-4) took on the Northern 
Illinois Huskies in a doubleheader 
Sunday, capping off a four-game 
bout this weekend that resulted 
in a 3-1 record in favor of the 
Wolverines.

Michigan 
entered 
the 

doubleheader 
Sunday 
coming 

off an 8-5 loss in which a late 
spur in offense was not enough. 
However, the team clearly did 
not dwell on its performance, as 
the Wolverines won both games 
against the Huskies, 7-4 and 8-3, 
respectively.

“I liked the starting pitching, I 

liked the defense,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “We did 
enough offensively and got some 
big hits.”

Junior right-hander Michael 

Hendrickson took the mound 
for 
Michigan, 
and 
after 
a 

scoreless 
first 
inning, 
the 

Wolverines struck first as senior 
centerfielder 
Johnny 
Slater 

powered through an RBI triple 
to the right-field gap. He would 
ultimately make it home on a 
sacrifice fly from junior first 
baseman Jake Bivens.

Slater would repeat exactly 

what he did in the third inning 
with a two-run triple, increasing 
the Michigan lead to four.

“We were just sticking with it, 

and knowing that we were going 
to come through at some point,” 
Slater said. “I think everybody 
goes up there knowing that they 
are going to have a quality at-bat.”

Northern 
Illinois 
did 
not 

simply keel over, though, as a 
four-run fifth inning categorized 
by two walks, a ground-rule 
double over the left field line and 
a two-run RBI single forced its 
way back into competition.

After the four total runs from 

Michigan in the second and third 
innings, it would not score again 
until the bottom of the ninth, 
when Lugbauer launched his 
walk-off home run. Its late game 
surge propelled them to a 7-4 
victory over the Huskies. 

“We 
probably 
had 
more 

quality at-bats than we’ve had 
in a long time,” Bakich said. “ … 
I don’t know how many times 
we’ve lined out, but that was as 
good contact as we’ve made all 
season.”

The Wolverines’ mid-game 

hitting 
woes 
clearly 
sorted 

themselves out in the second 
game of the doubleheader as 
they had just three scoreless 
innings. 
Junior 
right-hander 

Alec Rennard was slated for the 
matchup, and went six innings 
forfeiting just four hits.

Michigan scored two runs 

in the fourth, fifth and sixth 
innings, respectively, highlighted 
by Lugbauer’s solo home run in 
the bottom of the third inning.

Freshman 
right 
fielder 

Dominic 
Clementi 
had 
a 

breakout 
performance 
this 

weekend as he was a late addition 
to the lineup, going 3-for-3 with 
an RBI. Senior catcher Harrison 
Wenson also played his role to 
near-perfection, going 1-for-3 
with three RBIs.

“We were doing it in a variety 

of ways, a couple home runs, 
a couple stolen bases, bunts, 
moving runners,” Bakich said. “ 
… We scored in multiple frames.”

The versatility shown from 

players like Lugbauer – who 
switched from catcher to first 
base in the second game — and 
the numerous relief pitchers that 
saw live innings is a signal that 
the Wolverines have significant 
depth that could carry them far 
into the season.

WOMEN’S SWIMMING
Michigan finishes 11th

In Indianapolis this weekend, 

the Michigan women’s swimming 
and diving team did something 
it has yet to do this millennium. 
The Wolverines scored their most 
points at the NCAA national meet 
since 1999, finishing 11th with 159 
points. 

The four-day meet kicked off 

with a historical performance by 
Michigan’s 800-yard freestyle 
relay, which finished third, with 
a time of 6:53.63. The team, 
comprised of sophomores Siobhan 
Haughey, Rose Bi, and juniors 
G 
Ryan 
and 

Gabby 
DeLoof, 

became the first 
Michigan relay to 
earn NCAA All-
American honors 
in any of the five 
relays in the last 
10 years.

Michigan 

coach 
Mike 

Bottom 
noted 

how strongly his 
team responded to the intensity of 
the meet.

“We 
are 
showing 
an 

understanding of how to get 
better through a difficult process,” 
Bottom said. “That’s what life is 
all about.” 

A grand total of 12 Michigan 

school records fell at the national 
meet as well. Of the 13 student 
athletes sent to the national meet, 
eight individuals and three relays 
earned All-American honors. 

One of those All-Americans 

was junior Clara Smiddy. Smiddy 
placed in the 200-yard backstroke 
for the second year in a row, and 
further bested her school record 
to 1:50.71. 

After a scratch by Tennessee’s 

Maddy Banic in the 100-yard 
butterfly on Friday, Michigan 
freshman Vanessa Krause, the 
first alternate, capitalized on the 
last-minute opportunity to score 
for Michigan. Smiddy recalled the 
support received by Krause.

“There’s always this sense of 

unity,” Smiddy said. “We had a 
sudden change where Krause had 
to swim a 100-yard butterfly with 
only a 300-yard warm up. That is 
really difficult to do, and she did 
a really good job by scoring. We 
were all behind her, cheering her 
on, there was a really strong sense 
of the team.” 

Freshman 
diver 
Kristen 

Hayden and senior diver Allie 
Murphy each contributed points 
to Michigan’s 11th place finish 
by scoring in the platform and 
three-meter, respectfully. Their 
accomplishments 
mark 
the 

first time since 1994 that two 

divers 
have 

scored 
at 
the 

national 
meet. 

Coach 
Bottom 

commented 
on 

the performance 
of 
the 
three 

divers 
that 

scored points for 
Michigan. 

“We are really 

united,” Bottom 
said. “We are 

really excited that divers scored. 
It’s exciting to see them practicing 
and stepping up and scoring.”

Reflecting upon the weekend’s 

highs and lows, Bottom said 
he wanted to recover from the 
intensity of the week and look 
towards the future.

“It was an exhausting four 

days,” Bottom said. “It was 
exhausting, but we are still 
standing.” 

And standing they are. The 

Wolverines will be back in the 
pool on Monday, and, next 
week, the men’s team heads to 
Indianapolis for its national meet.

Looking towards the future, 

Bottom discussed how he felt 
building unity was important 
when gearing up for the future. 

“We are going to continue to 

build this team,” Bottom said. 
“We are going to keep pushing to 
do better both in and out of the 
water, caring for each other and 
fighting for Michigan.”

Championships to cap 2017 season

‘M’ shows bright future at national meet

The Michigan wrestling team 

has been battered by injuries all 
year long. But even right before 
the season came to a close, bad 
luck came their way again. 
Redshirt sophomore Zac Hall 
and — especially heartbreaking 
— senior captain Brian Murphy 
would be unable to compete.

The 
Wolverines 
would 

only be able to send a small 
squad of five wrestlers to the 
tournament. But fortunately 
for Michigan, three freshmen 
would go on to have truly 
standout performances.

Logan 
Massa 
took 
third 

overall, and Myles Amine and 
Stevan Micic both took fourth 
in 
their 
respective 
weight 

classes. All three earned All-
American honors.

Perhaps the biggest moment 

of the tournament came when 
the three freshmen reached 
the consolation semifinals. For 
each wrestler, a win meant 
competing for third place, while 
a loss meant competing for fifth.

Micic was up first, and 

he handily beat No. 3 Kaid 
Brock from Oklahoma State, 
10-4. Massa also picked up a 
10-4 win, over the Cowboys’ 
Chandler Rogers. Amine had 
a 
standout 
match, 
pinning 

Cornell’s 
second-seed 
Brian 

Realbuto, which provided huge 
bonus points for the team. The 
Wolverines went 3-for-3. All 
of them were headed to the 
consolation finals.

Amine and Micic both failed 

to overcome their opponents in 
the finals, placing fourth after 
falling to top-seeded wrestlers. 
Micic faced Ohio State’s Nathan 
Tomasello 
— 
a 
returning 

national champ — and Amine 
faced Arizona State’s Zahid 
Valencia.

Massa, however, dominated 

his way to a third-place finish 
over Wisconsin’s No. 5 Isaac 
Jordan. Jordan is a two-time 
Big 
Ten 
champion, 
NCAA 

finalist and a senior. Massa, 
a freshman, still beat him 

handily. It just goes to show 
Massa’s competitive nature — 
that he still wasn’t pleased by 
such a solid finish.

“The goal was to win a 

national 
title,” 
Massa 
said. 

“How I can get my hands on the 
guy that beat me, the guys that 
are in the finals, 
where 
can 
I 

see them next, 
that’s what I’m 
thinking 
about 

right now.”

Massa 

suffered 
a 

heartbreaking 
loss 
to 
Penn 

State’s 
Vicenzo 

Joseph 
in 
the 

semifinals, as he 
could not finish the go-ahead 
takedown. 
Regardless, 
his 

achievements and those of Micic 
and Amine are impressive.

“What they did this weekend 

was pretty incredible. They 

competed at a very very elite 
level, with the best kids in the 
country,” said Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland. “And to do it as 
freshmen is amazing.”

On 
their 
efforts, 
the 

Wolverines 
finished 
the 

tournament 10th overall. To 

have 
such 
a 

successful 
finish 
clearly 

meant a great 
deal to a team 
that endured so 
much bad luck 
throughout the 
season.

“With the ups 

and downs of 
this season, to 
be able to come 

to this tournament with a group 
of five and compete the way 
they did is such a great feat,” 
McFarland said. “The whole 
coaching staff is so proud of 
these guys, and not just of the 

three All-Americans, but all of 
these guys.”

After a strong finish, it 

is hard not to eagerly await 
the next year of Michigan 
wrestling. These three talented 
freshmen will return, as well as 
a talented pool who redshirted 
this 
season. 
This 
includes 

one of the best heavyweights 
in the country: the talented 
two-time All-American senior 
Adam Coon. Senior Domenic 
Abounader, a Big Ten champion 
and All American, will also 
be 
returning. 
Finally, 
All-

American junior Alec Pantaleo, 
who finished sixth last season, 
will join the lineup.

“We’re excited about the 

team we have coming back,” 
McFarland said. “We could be in 
the hunt next year at the NCAA 
championship in Cleveland.”

And with three freshmen 

returning with previous NCAA 
success, they definitely could be.

Michigan’s big men take over in win

INDIANAPOLIS — Seventeen 

agonizingly long seconds stood 
between the Michigan men’s 
basketball team and victory as DJ 
Wilson stepped to the line for two 
crucial free throws.

A 
miss 
by 
the 
redshirt 

sophomore forward on the front 
end of the one-and-one would have 
given the Cardinals ample time to 
tie the game — or even win it.

But Wilson was ready for the 

moment, sinking both shots to 
keep Michigan up by four.

Louisville, 
though, 
wasn’t 

ready to give up, as guard 
Donovan Mitchell — who led the 
Cardinals with 19 points — sliced 
his way down the court to close 
the gap to two.

On 
the 
ensuing 
inbounds, 

again, the Wolverines got the ball 
to Wilson, and he was quickly 
fouled. Just eight seconds had 
elapsed between his last trip to the 
charity stripe, and the result was 
the same.

Wilson 
sank 
both 
free 

throws, finally icing the game as 
Michigan moved on to the NCAA 
Tournament Sweet Sixteen with 
a 73-69 win over Louisville at 
Bankers Life Fieldhouse.

In most situations this season, 

it has been the guards who have 
received that inbounds 
pass. 

Whether it is senior guard Derrick 
Walton, senior wing Zak Irvin 
or junior guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rakhman, the Wolverines’ 
guards have been the ones to go to 
the line to ice the game.

But on this night, it was Wilson 

who came up clutch.

“I saw a gap in their press late 

in the second half,” Wilson said. 
“(Irvin), luckily inbounded me 
the ball, and I knocked (the free 
throws) down.”

That was the theme of the 

game. The Cardinals defensive 
game plan going into the contest 
was to not switch on Michigan’s 
screens in order to stay out on the 

shooters. But with the length of 
Louisville’s big men, the Cardinals 
ended 
up 
switching 
anyway, 

effectively neutralizing Walton 
and company in the process.

Louisville coach Rick Pitino 

regularly rotates centers Mangok 
Mathiang and Anas Mahmoud 
and forwards Jaylen Johnson 
and Ray Spalding, and the four 
players were great at defending 
Michigan’s guards.

When Louisville switched on 

ball screens, its big men made it 
tough for the Wolverines’ guards 
to operate. They also crashed 
the offensive glass all game long, 
making life difficult for Michigan, 
nearly shifting the balance of the 
game in the process.

“They’re 
long 
and 
they’re 

quick,” said junior wing Duncan 
Robinson. “They move well for 
guys their size, and they have such 
great length. It’s easier for them 
than other bigs.”

But at halftime, Michigan coach 

John Beilein told his big men to 
slip off the ball screen, and that 
was the key to the Wolverines’ 
success in the second half.

It gave the Wolverines’ big men 

a chance to feast, and they took 
full advantage, winding down 
Louisville’s eight-point halftime 
lead to win.

Wilson finished with 17 points 

on 6-of-13 shooting, but he wasn’t 
even the star of the show for 
Michigan.

Sophomore forward Moritz 

Wagner, 
who 
had 
scored 
a 

combined 11 points in his last two 
games, exploited Louisville off 
the pick-and-roll on his way to a 
game-high 26 points on 11-of-14 
shooting.

“We’ve been working a lot on 

switching defenses,” Wagner said. 
“DJ and I have the confidence to 
do our thing. (Louisville) stayed 
with the shooters and gave us a 
lot of room, and we were able to 
finish plays.”

Added Wilson: “We could 

catch them in the middle of a 
screen and hit Moe or myself on 

a roll to the basket. Moe benefited 
from that a lot in the second half. I 
think he had three or four baskets 
from that.”

It wasn’t just Wilson and 

Wagner who had success — 
Michigan’s third big man, redshirt 
junior Mark Donnal, also had 
some success off the bench.

Donnal hit a crucial three 

early in the game to keep 
Louisville at bay, while also 
providing cover for Wagner 
when he was in foul trouble.

“It’s great having a ‘5’ like that 

coming off the bench that can 
stretch the defense,” Wilson said. 

“He got a block, a couple rebounds 
and kept them off the glass. And 
then he hit that big time three. 
Mark is just as good of a shooter as 
anybody on the team.”

The ironic thing about Sunday’s 

game was that many viewed 
Louisville’s 
frontcourt 
as 
its 

biggest advantage over Michigan 
going 
into 
the 
game. 
The 

Wolverines, though, made sure 
that wasn’t the case.

In the bigger picture, the 

Wolverines’ seventh straight win 
came in a much different fashion 
than their last six.

Last weekend in the Big Ten 

Tournament, it was Michigan’s 
defense and guard play that led 
it to victory. Friday, it was the 
Wolverines’ 
3-point 
shooting 

that led them to a victory over 
Oklahoma State.

Against Louisville, it was all big 

men.

“Next man up” — it’s a 

sentiment that the team has 
preached all year long. And 
Sunday, on the biggest stage thus 
far, they proved exactly why. 

“We don’t see ourselves as a 

shooting team,” Wagner said. “We 
know we can shoot, but that’s not 
the only thing we can do.”

‘M’ moves

The revenge tour will continue 

for 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team.

While 

nothing may 
alleviate 
the sting of getting snubbed 
from the NCAA Tournament on 
Monday, the Wolverines (24-9) 
have survived the first two games 
of the Women’s National Invitation 
Tournament, enduring a fourth-
quarter scare to win their second 
round game over Wright State (25-
9), 71-66, on Saturday.

“In March, anytime you’re 

playing a tournament — it doesn’t 
matter what tournament — people 
are gonna come and give you their 
best shot. Wright State did that 
tonight.” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico. “But for us to find a 
way to win at this point in March, 
I was really proud of the way that 
were able to do that down the 
stretch.”

The direction of the game 

seemed to be apparent from the 
opening tipoff. Michigan had 
the clear height and strength 
advantage down low, attacking the 
paint often for its first 14 points of 
the match — eight from sophomore 
center Hallie Thome — before the 
Wolverines went to the free-throw 
line. Michigan’s defense followed 
suit in the first quarter, limiting 
the Raiders to just a 21.9 shooting 
percentage from the field to end 
the frame ahead, 23-12.

The second quarter proved to be 

much of the same — stingy defense 
and production from Thome, who 
hit her first seven field goals of the 
game. Wright State attempted to 
double Thome, but it ultimately 
spaced the floor to allow other 
Wolverines 
like 
junior 
guard 

Katelynn Flaherty and freshman 
guard Kysre Gondrezick to drive 
to the hoop. Neither Flaherty nor 
Gondrezick established a rhythm 
from beyond the arc throughout 
the game, but still managed to 
combine for 29 of Michigan’s 
points.

The Raiders were able to 

capture some momentum toward 
the end of the half by capitalizing 
on six Wolverine turnovers to 
narrow their deficit to 10, but that 
swing quickly came to a close after 
Gondrezick buried a halfcourt 
buzzer-beater to give Michigan a 
45-32 lead headed into halftime.

“We practice that every day 

at shootaround,” Barnes Arico 
said. “As coaches we were taking 
votes on who is our best halfcourt 
shooter and Kysre was my pick, so 
I was glad she had the ball in her 
hands. … She knew the situation 
and made a play.”

Wright State turned up the pace 

in third quarter, running a full 
court press and charging toward 
the basket every time it brought the 
ball up the floor. The Wolverines 
struggled to adjust, and their lead 
dwindled to as little as four points 
until a Gondrezick trey halted the 
Raiders’ run. That seven-point lead 
would hold for the remaining five 
minutes of the quarter.

The final period began as a back-

and-forth battle, but Wright State 
eventually mounted an 8-0 run 
to take its first lead of the game 
with 4:52 remaining. A number 
of Michigan’s shots circled the 
rim during the run and there was 
visible frustration on the court, 
but junior forward Jillian Dunston 
utilized a timeout to rally the 
Wolverines.

“She kept going to the huddle 

and she was being positive (saying) 
‘Coach, we’ve got this,’ ” Barnes 
Arico said. “She was telling the 
team ‘Hey, we’ve got this, just get 
stops on the defensive end. Let’s 
just go continue to play hard, we’re 
okay.’ ”

Added Dunston: “I think we get 

uptight. Our layups were in and 
out, our shots were in and out, we 
couldn’t get a stop. Once we calmed 
down, the game went in our favor.”

After the timeout, an and-one by 

Thome gave Michigan a lead that it 
wouldn’t give it up, as the Raiders 
scored only once more in the game. 
They pulled within one in the 
final minute, but a Thome putback 
with 40 seconds remaining and a 
defensive stop solidified the win.

The victory sets up a possible 

third-round match with St. John’s, 
where Barnes Arico was the 
head coach for 10 seasons before 
assuming the same position with 
the Wolverines in 2012.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Thome reaches 1,000 
points, lifts Michigan

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball 
team 
narrowly 

squeaked 
by 
Wright 
State 

in the second round of the 
Women’s National Invitation 
Tournament 
on 
Saturday. 

Sophomore 
Hallie 
Thome 

was a major factor in the 
Wolverines’ 71-66 win. With 
her 23 points, the 6-foot-5 
center surpassed the 1,000-
point mark, becoming just the 
third sophomore in school 
history to do so.

“It’s definitely exciting to 

reach 1,000 points,” Thome 
said. “But all my shots are 
worth 
two 

points, so there 
are 500 assists 
out there that 
I couldn’t have 
reached 
it 

without.”

Right 
from 

the 
start, 

Thome 
put 

her 
stamp 

on the game, 
scoring 
the 

first two layups for Michigan 
and making her first seven 
shots in a row. She tallied 14 
points by halftime and proved 
to be a difficult mark for the 
Raiders to guard down low. 
Her teammates took advantage 
of her length by lobbing passes 
inside — some of which looked 
impossible to catch — which 
Thome buried.

“I 
thought 
Hallie 
was 

incredible,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico. “She 
came out of the gates scoring 
every which way. Just really a 
tough matchup for them. She 
has such great hands. She has 
such great finishing around 
the rim and she made some big 
plays for us down the stretch.”

Despite Thome’s efforts, the 

Wolverines let a 20-point lead 
slip away completely, and it 
nearly cost them the game. 

Michigan 
went 
down 

64-63 with 4:52 left in the 
fourth quarter — the first time 
Wright State took the lead all 
game. But Thome brought the 
Wolverines out of their deficit. 
Her signature layup and 61.5 
percent field goal percentage 
allowed her teammates to trust 
her and get her the ball, even in 
an intense postseason scenario.

“Our 
game 
plan 
didn’t 

change,” said junior guard 
Jillian Dunston. “As you can 
see, Hallie still killed it in the 
second half.”

Thome’s 
reliability 
goes 

beyond just making baskets. 
She 
earned 
seven 
boards 

against the Raiders, second 
only to Dunston’s 11. Dunston 

leads Michigan 
in 
rebounds, 

with 251, and 
Thome 
is 

right 
behind 

her with 238. 
Each of them 
has over 100 
rebounds more 
than any other 
Wolverine.

Despite 

her 
massive 

contributions, Thome also has 
the highest number of fouls, 
with 93 on the season. Notably, 
she only picked up one foul 
against the Raiders, meaning 
she was not forced to play 
conservatively.

“I tend to get in a little bit of 

foul trouble,” Thome said after 
playing Kent State on Thursday 
night. “(When you get in 
foul trouble) its definitely a 
different style of play. You kind 
of have to change your game 
to make sure you don’t pick up 
another one.”

Without Thome on the court, 

Michigan 
has 
unexceptional 

height and less inside presence, 
and it is forced to rely more 
heavily on its guards. When she is 
in the game though, she is always 
effective. For the Wolverines to 
win the WNIT, Thome will need 
to continue avoid foul trouble, 
and keep on scoring.

‘M’ wins Big Ten title

It was a big week for the 

Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team. Not only did five gymnasts 
make the All-Big Ten first team 
but it also clinched its fourth Big 
Ten Championship in a row.

Honorees 
for 
first 
team 

included seniors Nicole Artz 
and Talia Chiarelli, junior Paige 
Zaziski and sophomores Olivia 
Karas and Emma McLean. Junior 
Lauren Marinez was honored on 
the second team.

The Wolverines traveled to 

Piscataway to compete against 
five other teams at the Rutgers 
Athletic 
Center 
and 
they 

dominated the meet, winning 
four individual events.

Artz 
won 
the 
all-around, 

McLean won vault, Chiarelli won 
balance beam and Karas won the 
floor exercise.

“I thought we did really well 

on beam, and that just opened 
it up for us to have fun and be 
aggressive and just really enjoy 
floor and vault,” Michigan coach 
Bev Plocki said. “Emma was just 
the exclamation point at the end 
of a great meet.”

McLean finished off the meet 

with a beautifully executed vault 
and stuck the landing, earning 
a score of 9.975 to tie her career 
high and secure the individual 
title.

“I knew I was going to be the 

last competitor from Michigan 
pretty much and everyone else 
had hit their vaults. So I just did 
what I do and it worked out,” 
McLean said.

As the season winds down, 

the Wolverines are starting to 
compete in more meets with 
multiple opponents, which is 
different from their regular-
season dual meets .

And 
with 
the 
extra 

competition, 
the 
gymnasts 

attribute their success to the 
energy created in the arena which 
gave them the extra edge they 
need to compete.

“The energy in the arena is 

outrageous,” Artz said. “There’s 
nothing you can compare to that 
and then to have the opportunity 
to compete on podium makes it 
even that much more fun. “

McLean 
agrees 
with 
her 

teammate, 
noting 
that 
she 

hopes the atmosphere will carry 
through in upcoming meets.

“We build off the energy 

the entire meet, and we kept 
it going the entire time and it 
was amazing,” McLean said. 
“Hopefully moving forward, we 
can keep that energy as well.”

The two leaders on the team 

are the two seniors Artz and 
Chiarelli. They have dedicated 
four years to the team and have 
four Big Ten Championship rings 
to show for it.

The 
two 
captains 
have 

also collected a plethora of 
individual accolades over the 
years. This season they both won 
individual titles at the Big Ten 
Championships and Atrz was 
named Big Ten Gymnast of the 
Year.

Both Artz and Plocki have 

described the season ending 
as bittersweet, saying they are 
looking forward to the future but 
will miss the team a lot.

“These 
two 
seniors 
have 

been so incredibly strong and 
consistent all four years, and it’s 
bittersweet because you look to 
see where they are now and what 
they’re going to be going off to 
do,” Plocki said. “It’s really going 
to be sad to lose them at the end 
of the year.”
