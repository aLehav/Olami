SELECTION 2010
In debate,
candidates
spar over
higher ed.
Only debate of gubernatorial
race offered contrast between
candidates' positions
By MIKE MERAR
Daily Staff Reporter
Democratic candidate for governor Virg Bernero
and Republican candidate Rick Snyder took the floor
last night at the only Michigan gubernatorial debate
of the midtermelection season, sparring on issues that
ranged from higher education funding, to affirmative
action, to the state's budget.
Nolan Finley, editorial page editor of The Detroit
News, and Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor
of the Detroit Free Press, moderated the debate, which
was hosted by the Center for Michigan and aired live
from Detroit Public Television's Wixom studio.
Snyder began the debate by stressing his new vision
for the state, which focuses largely on job creation.
"It is time for the era of innovation," he said. "I've
got a 10-point plan that really focuses on jobs."
During Bernero's opening statement he elaborated
on his current position as mayor of Lansing, adding
that if elected, he hopes to recreate the flourishing
Michigan that existed when he was younger.
"I've got a plan to turn Michigan around," Berne-
ro said. "The Michigan I grew up in is a Michigan of
opportunity. That's the Michigan I'm fighting for."
Amid a $1.6 billion state deficit, the two candidates
were asked if they would be willing to forgo their sala-
ry should they become governor. Both said they would
make significant sacrifices. However, Bernero said he
wouldn't be able to completely omit his salary, as he
needs to support his family.
The candidates also discussed tax incentives to

Interim policy allows
students to canvass
only in residences in
which they live
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily StaffReporter
With less than one month before
Election Day, campus political
organizations are voicing concern
about an interim University Hous-
ing policy that allows students to
only do political canvassing in the
residence halls in which they live.

Since 2008, only students cam-
paigning for positions in the Michi-
gan Student Assembly and LSA
Student Government and repre-
sentatives of Voice Your Vote - an
MSA commission that encourages
non-partisan voter registration -
have been consistently allowed to
engage in pre-approved canvassing
in University residences, according
to University policy. In the last few
years, University Housing has not
implemented a permanent policy
about student canvassing for politi-
cal causes and elections.
University Housing spokesman
Peter Logan wrote in an e-mail
interview that the current interim

policy allows students to engage in
political discourse without com-
promising their privacy and secu-
rity.
"The residence halls and under-
graduate apartments are not 'open
territory' for non-residents to
engage in political canvassing or
any other form of soliciting resi-
dents," Logan wrote. "University
Housing embraces the fundamen-
tal principle that residence halls
are our student's homes. We strive
to ensure that their environments
remain conducive to studying, rest-
ing, relaxing and socializing."

LANSING - With the issue
* of cyberbullying garnering
increased attention across the
country and on campus, students
and LGBTQ rights activists gath-
ered here on Friday asking policy
makers to do more to stop harass-

ment on the Internet.
Supporters of the LBGTQ
community and the student-run
organization Expect Respect in
Michigan assembled on the steps
of Michigan's state Capitol on Fri-
day to voice support for Michigan
Student Assembly President Chris
Armstrong and to advocate for
stricter anti-bullying legislation.
Ross School of Business gradu-
ate student Adrian Delmont, who
is a member of Expect Respect in
Michigan and who helped orga-
nize the event, said the group
held the rally to expose the trag-

ic repercussions of bullying in
schools and urge supporters of the
LGBTQ community to speak out
against cyberbullying and student
harassment.
About 60 people gathered at the
Capitol to advocate for the cause,
and five speakers gave personal
testimonies of their experiences
with bullying at school and work
because of their sexual orienta-
tion.

Marijuana legalization activ-
ist John Sinclair urged students to
ignore material pursuits in favor of
activism during a talk on Saturday.
Sinclair, a poet, activist and self-
proclaimed performer, met with
students at the Luther Coopera-

tive House on Hill Street to speak
about his life, values and issues
facing Detroit. The open question-
and-answer session was coinci-
dentally held on what would be
the seventieth birthday of former
Beatles member John Lennon, who
played a large part in Sinclair's life
- helping to shorten his jail sen-
tence by more than seven years.
In 1969, Sinclair was sen-
tenced to 10 years for handing
two marijuana joints to an under-
cover policeman in Michigan. He
garnered many supporters who
opposed his sentence - includ-

ing Lennon, who performed the
song "John Sinclair" at a rally in
Ann Arbor in December 1971 that
was organized to raise awareness
about Sinclair's sentence. Three
days later, Sinclair was released
after the Michigan Supreme Court
ruled that the state's current laws
regarding marijuana were uncon-
stitutional.
The rally became the basis for
"Hash Bash," a gathering of mari-
juana legalization advocates that
takes place in Ann Arbor every
spring.

Police: School shooting
suspect not cooperating

0I

Two girls injured
in San Diego grade
school shooting
CARLSBAD, Calif (AP) - The
suspect in a San Diego-area grade
school shooting that left two
young girls injured was not coop-
erating with investigators, police
said, and the man's neighbors
described strange behavior in the
months before the shooting.
Brendan L. O'Rourke, 41, was
in custody Saturday for investi-
gation of six counts of attempted
murder and numerous weapons
violations.
Carlsbad police Lt. Kelly Cain
said O'Rourke was refusing to
answer questions and police did
not know what he intended to do
or why he opened fire, but they
believe he acted alone.
"He is not cooperating with
the investigation," Cain said Fri-
day night. "He probably has some
mental health issues."
O'Rourke's neighbors told the
San Diego Union-Tribune in a
story posted on its website Sat-
urday that he often screamed
obscenities and racial epithets
alone in his apartment. Neigh-
bors said they frequently called
police.
Vickie Rowe-Mitchell, who
lives in the apartment beneath
O'Rourke, said he would curse and

scream the N-word for hours late
at night, and said his stomping and
banging was so loud her ceiling
fan would shake and parts of her
ceiling would fall.
"I always felt in my head he was
going to do something bad," she
told the newspaper. "It was just a
feeling in my soul."
None of the residents of Canyon
Creek Apartments knew what he
did for a living.
Another neighbor, Ashley John-
son, said she had seen O'Rourke on
Friday morning just a few hours
before the shooting.
"I was opening my door and she
was just leaving," Johnson said.
"He closed his door really fast and
there was this weird chemical
smell. It smelled really weird in his
house."
Police said a propane tank was
found near O'Rourke's car and a
gas canister was found at a play-
ground at the school after the
shooting.
At about noon Friday, police
said O'Rourke parked his car,
jumped a fence and opened fire on
the crowded playground, hitting
a 6-year-old and 7-year-old in the
arms before construction workers
tackled him.
The girls were taken by helicop-
ter to Rady Children's Hospital.
The injuries were not life-threat-
ening and they are expected to
make a full recovery, Cain said.
Second-grader Caden Smith

said he ended up in a classroom
with injured girls.
"One, her arm was covered in
blood and all you could see was
red," Caden told the North County
Times. "The other, there wasn't
that much blood."
Third-grader Tommy Donahue
said he was playing outside when
he heard what sounded like fire-
crackers.
"Once the noise happened,
everybody decided to scream and
run for the classroom," Tommy
told the newspaper as he stood
next to his mother. "I felt safe in
the classroom."
O'Rourke was briefly taken to
Scripps Memorial Hospital then
booked at the Vista Jail.
Sheriff's deputies reached by
phone Saturday said they did not
know if he had hired a lawyer.
Parents, like professional surfer
Scott Chandler who lives across
the street, shudder to think of
what could have happened if the
man had not been stopped.
"He had some kind of mission
he was on and he didn't complete
it," Chandler said.
Chandler was repairing a Jet
Ski in his driveway when he heard
two loud bangs and saw children
running and screaming. He ran
downhill in his flip-flops and took
cover behind some tall Eucalyptus
trees while he called 911. He saw
several men struggling on the side
of the road.

"
Tense final hours ahead
for trapped Chile-m-iners'

NYC hate crime suspects arraigned

33 miners have
been trapped
underground for
two months
SAN JOSE MINE, Chile (AP) -
A smooth-walled path to daylight
awaited 33 trapped miners yes-
terday as they entered the tense
final hours of a two-month odys-
sey christened in the terror of col-
lapsing rock deep under a Chilean
mountain.
With the eyes of the world on
Chile's no-expense-spared effort
to ensure all the men emerge
unharmed, the miners' physical
and mental health was being fas-
tidiously monitored. Precautions
were taken against all manner of
complications - aspirin to pre-
vent blood clots, a special drink to
settle the stomach, video monitors
to watch for panic attacks.
And officials said the men
were so giddy with confidence
they were squabbling on Satur-
day, the day drills broke through
to them, over who would get to
be the last to- take a twisting,
20-minute ride the half-mile up

to a rock-strewn desert moon-
scape and into the embrace of
those they love.
A tentative but secret list was
drafted of which miners should
come out first when the extraction
begins, probably on Wednesday.
But Health Minister Jaime Mana-
lich said the otherwise coopera-
tive minerswere so sure of the exit
plan that they were arguing about
sequence.
"They were fighting with us
yesterday because everyone want-
ed to be at the end of the line, not
the beginning," he told reporters.
Manalich told The Associated
Press that a few had volunteered
in conversations among them-
selves to go up first. But none had
volunteered publicly, he said.
"I think they're more excited
than scared or nervous," Brandon
Fisher, president of Center Rock
Inc., the Pennsylvania company
that made the hammer-style drill
heads that created the opening
for the rescue, told AP. "That first
guy up might be a little nervous,
though."
The final order will probably
be determined by two paramed-
ics, one from the Navy and one
from the Codelco state mining

company, who will be lowered
into the mine to prepare the men
for their journey in a rescue cap-
sule built by Chilean naval engi-
neers.
Over the past week, all the
miners underwent tests to assess
their health. Manalich said offi-
cials were concerned about acute
hypertension in some of the min-
ers as well as the opposite - sud-
den drops in blood pressure - in
others because of the speed of the
ascent to the surface.
Another concern is blood clot-
ting. To counteract it, the miners
began taking 100 milligrams each
of aspirin yesterday, he said. They
will also put on compression socks
and a special girdle and will beon
a special high-calorie liquid pre-
pared and donated by NASA for
the final six hours before being
removed, Manalich said.
The liquid-only diet is to pre-
vent them from becoming nau-
seated. The rescue capsule is
expected to rotate 350 degrees
some10 to12 timesthroughcurves *
in the 28-inch-diameter escape
hole on its way up, he added.
Officials biggest worry was
panic attacks, the health minister
said.

Eight suspects
charged for torture,
anti-gay attacks
NEW YORK (AP) - Eight
gang suspects arrested in the
torture of two teenage boys
and a man in an anti-gay attack
were arraigned yesterday on
hate crime charges, standing in
a courtroom with their heads
down and their hands cuffed
behind them as their relatives
wept.
At the hearing, Assistant Dis-

trict Attorney Theresa Gottlieb
said that during the Oct. 3 attack
each victim was asked before
being beaten, "Is it true that
you're a fag?"
The charges against the defen-
dants include robbery, assault,
sexual abuse and unlawful
imprisonment as hate crimes.
The defendants didn't enter
pleas, and police were looking
for a ninth suspect, who had
been expected to turn himself in
but didn't show up.
The nine members of the Latin
King Goonies gang had heard
a rumor one of their teenage

recruits was gay and then found
the teen, stripped him, beat him
and sodomized him with a plung-
er handle until he confessed
to having had sex with a man,
police say. The gang members
then found a second teen they
suspected was gay and tortured
him and the man, police say.
The gang members found the
man by inviting him to a house,
telling him they were having
a party, police say. When he
arrived, they burned, beat and
tortured him for hours and sod-
omized him with a miniature
baseball bat, police say.

LANSING, Mich.
Poll: Snyder keeps
big lead in gov. race
Republican Rick Snyder retains
a wide lead over Democrat Virg
Bernero in the Michigan gover-
nor's race, according to a new poll
released yesterday.
Lansing-based EPIC-MRA says
49 percent of 600 likely Michigan
voters back Snyder and 29 per-
cent back Bernero, with 18 percent
undecided. Four percent prefer one
of three minor party candidates in
the race. A September EPIC-MRA
poll had Snyder ahead 53 percent to
29 percent.
The two telephone polls were
commissioned by the Detroit Free
Press and TV stations WXYZ,
WJRT, WOOD and WILX. The
most recent one surveyed 600 like-
ly voters statewide Oct. 3-7 and had
a margin of sampling error of plus
or minus 4 percentage points.
The polls show Bernero's state-
wide name recognition increased
from 81 percent to 89 percent in the
past month. Snyder's name is rec-
ognized by 92 percent.
PHILADELPHIA
Obama urges crowd
to show him the
energy of 08
President Barack Obama tried
to recapture some of the big-stage
excitement of his 2008 campaign
yesterday, imploring voters not to
reward what he called Republican
cynicism and incompetence by sit-
ting out the Nov. 2 elections.
The president delivered one
of his most stinging indictments
yet of the GOP record to several
thousand people under blue skies
in Philadelphia's Germantown
neighborhood.
Obama acknowledged that many
Americans are frustrated, espe-
cially about the economy. He said
Republicans have decided "to ride
that frustration and anger" with-
out providing solutions. And he
said congressional Republicans
deliberately opposed his adminis-
tration and the Democratic major-
ity on almost every issue, in hopes
that stalemate would depress Dem-
ocratic turnout in the midterm
elections.
"If I said there were fish in the
sea, they said 'no,"' the president
said. "Theyfigured 'if Ohama-fails,
then we win."'
BELGRADE, Serbia
0 Serb. police clash
with protesters
Serbian riot police fought run-

sands of far-right supporters who
hurled Molotov cocktails and
stun grenades to try to disrupt
a gay pride march in downtown
Belgrade. More than 140 people
were hurt and more than 200 were
arrested, officials said.
Thousands of police officers
sealed off the streets in the capi-
tal where the march took place,
repeatedly clashing at several
locations with rioters who tried to
burst through security cordons.

CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION
Distinguished alumni help commemorate the 100th
anniversary of the political science department

By SARAH ALSADEN
For theDaily
The University's Department of
Political Science turned 100 years
old this year and to celebrate, the
department held panel presenta-
tions with renowned alumni - in
a variety of fields - who gradu-
ated with political science degrees
from the University.
In addition to celebrating the
department's 100th anniversary,
the events aimed to show current
political science majors the ver-
satility of their degree, accord-
ing to department officials. The
department also used the event to
celebrate its prestige and success
throughout its history.
Centennial celebrations began
Thursday with a screening at the
Michigan Theater of "Freedom's
Fury" - a documentary written
and directed by Colin Gray, a Uni-
versity alum and political science
major.
Gray was also the keynote
speaker for panel presentations
on Friday morning in the Michi-
gan Union Ballroom. Michigan Lt.
Gov. John Cherry, United Auto-
workers President Bob King and
Michigan Court of Appeals Judge
Kurtis T. Wilder also spoke at the
event.
During his lecture, Gray, who
is an independent filmmaker, dis-
cussed the benefits to his career
from his degree. He said his politi-
cal science degree influenced his
filmmaking and inspired him to
pursue an unconventional career
after he graduated from the Uni-
versity.
"I was starting to see how doc-
umentary filming is one of those
many jobs where there could be a
potentially unusual application of
a polisci degree," Gray said.
He added that political scien-
tists are trained to "seek out mul-
tiple perspectives" and identify
the causes of issues - a technique
Gray said he uses in the filmmak-
ing process.

Political science department officials and other event attendees celebrate the department's1tOOth anniversary on Friday.

"(Filmmakers) seek out mul-
tiple people to interview and then
we weave that information into a
compelling narrative or story," he
said.
Public 'Policy junior Ajooni
Sethi, who attended the event,
said she enjoyed listening to Gray
and learning about issues like
social justice even though she is
not majoring in political science.
"I think it's great that (it was)
all-encompassing," Sethi said.
"What (Gray) was speaking about
wasn't just for political science
majors."
More than100 students, faculty
and alumni gathered to hear the
panelists speak. Stephen Snyder, a
recent graduate who came back to
the University for the celebration,
said he thought it was interesting

that Gray took a "different path"
with his political science degree.
"As a student you hear that if
you want to be successful in a cer-
tain field, you have to do x, y and
z," Snyder said. "You have to fol-
low a blueprint, but (Gray) went
so far outside the box, and he's
making a profound social impact
through his work by doing it in
such an unconventional way."
Planning for the centennial
celebration began last year, and
topics were chosen based on the
careers of the panelists, according
to Jenna Bednar, associate profes-
sor of political science and mem-
ber of the centennial planning
committee.
Bednar said the planning com-
mittee chose a variety of accom-
plished alumni to speak at the

event.
"Our goal was to find speakers
that represent the many different
things that people can do with a
political science degree," Bednar
said. "Many of our students go
into law but not all, and we wanted
people to see the variety of occu-
pations or career paths they could
follow with a political science
degree."
Bednar also said the celebra-
tion is meant to showcase how the
department has maintained its
strong academic standing for the
past 100 years.
"We're unrivalled ... the politi-
cal science department has a his-
tory of being number one, number
two, number three (in rankings)
and again we're right there," Bed-
nar said. "Even though the depart-

ment has changed so much over
the years, we have changed in a
way that has kept us strong."
Charles Shipan, chair of the
political science department,
,said students with political sci-
ence degrees pursue a variety of
careers. Some have become active
in local politics, but others have
pursued careers outside of the
political arena like business and
law, he said.
"I think there are other people
who major in political science and
find it a fascinating topic of study
who are then just going to simply
use the skills they've gotten like
the ability to ask questions, think
deeply about an issue and the abil-
ity to think about evidence and
will take it in a completely differ-
ent direction," he said.

Death row inmate seeks DNA analysis

Convicted murderer
says new tests will
prove innocence
LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) - An
ex-con sent to Texas' death row for
three murders and spared from
execution earlier this year by the
U.S. Supreme Court is set to take
his case before the high court,
which may decide whether his
attorneys cantest items for DNA he
claims could prove his innocence.
Hank Skinner was convicted
of pummeling his girlfriend with
a pickax handle and stabbing her
two sons on New Year's Eve in 1993
in their Texas Panhandle home.

DNA evidence at his trial showed
blood on his clothing from that
night was his and from at least two
of the victims.
The Supreme Court will hear
arguments Wednesday on whether
prison inmates may use a federal
civil rights law to get DNA test-
ing that was not performed before
their conviction. Prosecutors in
Skinner's case have refused to
make some evidence available for
DNA testing, including knives
from the scene and a jacket next to
one of the bodies.
The arguments come seven
months after the Supreme Court
spared Skinner just an hour before
he was to go to the death chamber.
Justices said then they wanted to

postpone his execution until they
decided whether to review his
case.
"The relief Mr. Skinner seeks
is simple and limited: the oppor-
tunity to obtain access to physical
evidence for the purpose of con-
ducting DNA testing," Rob Owen,
a University of Texas law professor
and Skinner's lead attorney, said in
a brief to the high court.
Gray County District Attorney
Lynn Switzer has refused to sur-
render the items and lower courts
agreed with her, saying Texas law
already gave Skinner "plenty of
opportunity" to show additional
testing could prove his innocence.
Skinner, a former convicted car
thief and parole violator, was try-

ing to "game the system," Switzer
said.
Prosecutors have said there's
no evidence to conclusively prove
Skinner wasn't the killer and that
ample evidence exists to show he is
guilty. They also contend new DNA
testing "would not affirmatively
prove anything."
"They're fixing to kill me for
something I didn't do," Skinner,
48, said last December from a tiny
visiting cage outside death row as
his execution date neared.
To head off the scheduled March
execution, his legal team renewed
its appeals seeking release of evi-
dence for new DNA testing.
Since the Supreme Court jus-
tices agreed to look at the case, the

high court ruled in a DNA-related
case from Alaska that convicts
have no constitutional right to test
genetic evidence to try to show
their innocence. The court said it
would not second-guess states or
force them routinely to look again
at criminal convictions.
Attorneys for Switzer, citing
that case, argued in court briefs
that Skinner's lawyers hoped to
get federal district courts involved
in "second-guessing the decisions
of state courts" under state DNA
statutes. They also noted his trial
lawyer chose not to test items Skin-
ner now wants access to, and that
using the civil rights law was an
improper attempt to circumvent
other appeals already refused.

Fed. govt to try detainee
without its star witness

U.S. not appealing
NY decision to
ban witness
NEW YORK (AP) - The U.S.
government announced yesterday
it would prosecute the first Guan-
tanamo Bay detainee to face a civil-
ian trial without its star witness
because appealing a judge's ruling
excluding him could cause signifi-
cant delay and inconvenience other
witnesses and victims.
Besides, the government said in
a letter to U.S. District Judge Lewis
A. Kaplan, there was enough evi-
dence without the star witness to
convict Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani
of conspiring in1998 to blow up two
U.S. embassies in Africa, killing 224
people, including a dozen Ameri-
cans.
The decision by the government
not to appeal clears the way for
the trial to resume Tuesday, when
openingstatements are expected to
begin after a jury is chosen from a
pool of about 65 potential jurors in
Manhattan.
Inthe letter,Assistant U.S. Attor-
ney Michael Farbiarz said the gov-
ernment disagreed with the judge's
decision and would have appealed
it under different circumstances.

But he said many trial witnesses
had planned to come to New York
based on the long-scheduled date
of the trial and some might even be
unwilling or unable to return if the
trial faced a significant delay.
He said many victims have
already arrived in New York after a
long wait to see Ghailani face trial
after having traveled significant
distances.
"Anappeal at thisjjuncture would
obviously cause a delay - a delay of
uncertain, and perhaps significant,
length," the letter said. "Weighing
all of the circumstances, the gov-
ernment does not wish to delay the
trial in order to take an appeal."
The judge had handed the gov-
ernment a significant setback days
earlier when he ruled that the star
witness, Hussein Abebe, a former
cab driver from Tanzania, could not
testify that Ghailani bought explo-
sives from him. The judge said the
government learned about Abebe
when Ghailani underwent a coer-
cive interrogation at a secret CIA-
run camp overseas.
"The court has not reached this
conclusion lightly," the judge wrote
in his decision. "It is acutely aware
of the perilous nature of the world
in which we live. But the Consti-
tution is the rock upon which our
nation rests. We must follow it not

when it is convenient, but when fear
and danger beckon in a different
direction."
During that hearing, defense
lawyer Peter Quijano tried to show
that Abebe felt coerced to testify
because he feared law enforcement,
but Abebe insisted that was not so.
Another lawyer for Ghailani,
Steve Zissou, said the government's
decision not to appeal was "a signif-
icant victory for the Constitution."
"As we saw duringlhis testimony,
Mr. Abebe was hardly a credible
witness," Zissou said.
Ghailani has been accusedby the
government of being a bomb maker,
document forger and aide to Osama
bin Laden. He has pleaded not
guilty and has denied knowingthat
TNT and oxygen tanks he delivered
would be used to make a bomb.
There was little controversy
when Ghailani was brought to
New York for trial in 2009, but
the subject of where totry detain-
ees from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
became heated after Attorney
General Eric Holder announced
last November that professed
Sept. 11 attacks mastermind Kha-
lid Sheikh Mohammed and four
others would be tried blocks from
where the World Trade Center
stood. Holder later said he was
reconsidering the decision.

A rebound for Detroit
Chance of new arena should prompt Pistons's move
A s owners of the Red Wings and Tigers, Mike and
Marian Illitch control a 50-percent share of Detroit's
professional sports teams. Now, the Illitch family is
on its way to owning another of Detroit's big-name teams -
the Pistons. Mike Illitch is in negotiations to buy the Pistons.
He has also discussed obtaining tax incentives and funding
for the construction of a new Pistons venue downtown with
Detroit Mayor Dave Bing. Though moving the Pistons back
to Detroit would certainly aid the local economy, the city's
$85-million budget deficit is a considerable obstacle. If the
funding for the transition is handled responsibly, the Pis-
tons should move back to downtown Detroit.

Debate to educate

On Tuesday, multiple news outlets report-
ed that current Pistons owner Karen David-
son has decided to exclusively offer Illitch
30 days to make a bid on the team. A pur-
chase by Illitch, in conjunction with the
move back to Detroit, has the potential to
result in the construction of a joint venue
downtown to house the Pistons and the Red
Wings. Illitch has worked with Detroit in
the past to build sporting venues. In 2000,
he was involved in the construction of the
Tiger's Comerica Park, which cost a total
of $300 million to build - $115 million of
which was publicly funded, according to a
2006 Daily article.
A major roadblock in this new project
is whether or not Detroit can afford to
import the team. The city would have to
fund a large portion of any efforts to build
a new stadium, as well as negotiate tax
cuts and incentives at the expense of the
city's budget. With the budget's already
significant deficit in mind, Bing has stated
that the city may not be in the position to
offer Illitch any incentives, accordingto an
Oct. 5 USA Today article.
But the city could certainly use the extra
revenue. Detroit's ailing economy has
become an old story. Bringing the Pistons

back to the center of the city could help to
breathe new life into the struggling metrop-
olis. Building the new venue would also
provide employment for contractors and
construction companies. The Pistons have
led the NBA in attendance five out of the
last nine seasons, accordingto their website.
The new venue would create increased rev-
enue for surrounding businesses and pro-
vide jobs for local residents. Fans attending
games at a downtown arena would patron-
ize area bars, restaurants, gas stations and
hotels, among other businesses.
Should the plan for a new Pistons
venue downtown come to fruition, Illitch
shouldn't let the Palace become an eco-
nomic drain on Auburn Hills. Ideally,
Illitch would be able to unload the venue
to prospective buyers or keep it alive for
concerts and other performances.
Detroit would be a winner if all goes as
planned. Illitch has a proven track record
as a successful businessman and, more
importantly, as a successful Detroit sports
team owner. The remaining question is
whether city's government could afford
the move. But it's clear that the Detroit 'is-
tons should move back to the city that they
are named for.

someone with an opposing point of

Closing the education gap

What evolved as a dream for a group of stu-
dents in 1995 has today catapulted into a move-
ment for thousands of others. In the fashion of
great activists, children of the Freedom Move-
ment and students from Sam Brinkley Middle
School in Jackson, Mississippi organized them-
selves to help create a world of which they
would want to bea part.
These budding activists are helping to cre-
ate a society in which students of working class
families receive an exemplary education rather
than merely a "fair" one. Together, Taba and
Omo Moses - Civil Rights leaders and current
Harvard Professor Bob Moses' children - and
Khari Milner partnered with Brinkley Middle
School to create The Young People's Project.
The Young People's Project was crafted
from the belief that math literacy could impact
social change. In the United States, haves and
have-nots are often distinguished by their
quality of education. YPP was founded with
the conviction that the only way to minimize
this country's socio-economic disparity is to
challenge the achievement gap - specifically
in mathematics.
Solving the education conundrum is on the
YPP national agenda. But education problems
are also local, and can be confronted when
students have a shared interest in education
reform. Students from the University's Ann
Arbor and Dearborn campuses co-exist within
YPP's organizational framework, which also
includes Eastern Michigan University movers
and shakers like Morghan Williams. The coali-
tion also includes students like Khalid Sarsour
- former Lincoln High School Math literacy
worker and current student at the University
of Michigan's Dearborn campus - and the Uni-
versity at Ann Arbor student leaders like Natalie
Erb and Jacob Tanner.
Though the Ann Arbor site of YPP is cur-
rently undergoing dramatic financial budget
cuts, this setback hasn't decreased members'
optimism. Instead, it has created greater pos-
sibility for growth.
The cuts that YPP has experienced have
affected such schools as Lincoln High School

in Ypsilanti and Cesar Chavez Academy High
School in Detroit, where YPP sites no longer
exist. But the spirit of YPP is very much alive in
the Ypsilanti community and the lives of Lin-
coln High School students. According to the
Ann Arbor interim program director, Alexandra
Tracy, high school students like Nana Nyarko,
Nikita Miner, Aysha Williams and Amber Cobbs
are emerging activists. They are working inde-
pendently and with YPP's College Math Liter-
acy Workers to increase funding for sites that
have lost sponsorship. Under the guidance of
Sarsour, these students even formed their own
YPP club, meeting without former YPP staff.
By being plugged into the Detroit and Ann
Arbor-Ypsilanti communities, YPP is not only
changing the expectations of math achievement
for high school and middle school students, but
also cultivating power within the neighbor-
hoods and student communities around the
University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan Uni-
versity and Washtenaw Community College.
The idea is to increase the involvement of col-
lege students in the Flint and Detroit areas, like
those attending Wayne State University and the
University of Michigan's Flint campus.
I'm confident that YPP will eventually
receive the financial backing it needs to con-
tinue to foster visible growth in secondary
education because of its ability to build a coali-
tion by tapping into the community power at
the local level.
The only thing interfering with the students
disadvantaged by this country's wide-spread
achievement gap is their quality of learning.
YPP is challenging this problem by making use
of a child's potential at the grassroots level.
The Young People's Project is important to
the social progress of this country. This orga-
nization has created an alternative approach
for the academic inequalities of this country.
Its method is not slanted by the views of the left
or right wing. However, they are motivated by
the effects of social exclusion, which lend to an
unequal public school education.

The accidental boom?

Feeling drunk, tired, sleepy and
jilted, a young college student
decided to blog about it.
He was imma-
ture and said some
silly things about
the girl who broke
his heart ("All B-U
girls are bitches.").
But from that mad
moment, Mark
Zuckerberg was
well on his way to
founding Facebook, IMRAN
the $25-billion SYED
company that we
can't imagine being
without. (I under-
stand that this story, as told in the film
"The Social Network," is fictionalized
at every turn. But that makes no differ-
ence atthe moment)
When a friend ventured that the
Facebook idea could be worth big
money, Zuckerberg simply shrugged
it off, saying he was content with
building something cool. From Zuck-
erberg's timeless accident, we can
gather that even big, world-changing
things don't always announce their
arrival. Faith is essential on the road
to accomplishment.
Innovation for innovation's sake
isn't only a good idea, but in some
cases, it's also the only way forward.
We won't always see how our efforts
today will pay off in the future, but
we can rest assured that progress
today is better than sitting idly by and
waiting for a miracle.
This is something Michigan's law-
makers seem to have forgotten.
Four years ago, Michigan's three
largest research universities - the
University of Michigan, Michigan
State University and Wayne State Uni-
versity - united to create the Universi-
ty Research Corridor. From the outset,
the URC was more of an idea than any-
thing tangible. The three universities
always have and always will conduct
world-class research on a vast array of

subjects, but this union allowed them
to officially stand together.
The bargaining advantage that
unity brings matters because the three
universities of the URC want more
money from the state. As University
President Mary Sue Coleman told the
state House Appropriations Subcom-
mittee on Higher Education earlier
this year: "If we had more resources,
we could do more and do it faster."
State lawmakers remain skeptical
though, and that's no surprise, given
Michigan's rich heritage of under-
funding its public universities.
To the average state lawmaker,
increasing funding to state universi-
ties in a time of such financial hardship
would take an immense leap of faith.
The URC universities have continued
to provide world-class educations to
thousands of students and conduct cut-
ting-edge research, but can the state
really afford toinvest more?
It's a dilemma not unlike the one
early investors in the Facebook idea
struggled with. The social network-
ing site was taking off and seemed to
have a good following on Ivy-League
campuses, but was it really an Earth-
shattering event waiting to happen?
Could Facebook really go from a
fun distraction for college nerds to
something the world would embrace
as an essential part of personal inter-
action? They simply couldn't have
known. Investors just had to look at
the 20-year-old Harvard dropout
across the table from them and trust
that he was building the next big
thing - a thing their old minds would
never understand.
With political diatribes and misin-
formation swirling in the lead-up to
the November election, there is plenty
of talk about cutting costs. Like always,
certain lawmakers find it easy to score
a point with the base by contending
that universities are wasteful and train
mostly students who bolt from Michi-
gan the momentthey graduate. But this
type of talk is useless.

Clearly something is broken in
Michigan, and years of siphoning
funds away from universities hasn't
exactly turned things around. Michi-
gan lawmakers failed to take the leap
of faith at every turn in recent decades,
and the innovation boom came instead
to places like California and Mas-
sachusetts, while Michigan fell into
ruin. But it's not too late.

The URC is an
investment worthy
of our attention. 0
As stated in an economic report
released last week, the URC three
have contributed $14.8 billion to the
state's economy since 2007. At a time
when so many of the state's other,
desperate attempts at revival are fail-
ing, the three research universities
have brought money and activity to
this state and that has begun the turn-
around even while state lawmakers sit
on their hands.
Investing in this fledgling thing
called the URC is almost a no-brainer
at this point, given that we've already
begun to see results. Business people
in the know (California venture capi-
talist Tom Baruch, for example) are
already talking: Michigan is a place
to watch. We don't feel it yet, but S
efforts like the one research universi-
ties have made alone for the past few
decades are about to pay off.
We've built something here and
don't even know it: With any luck,
Michigan could emerge from its hang-
over smarter, stronger and wealthier.
The sooner state lawmakers jump on 0
board, the better.

One-man offense a huge problem

to mention a blow to Robinson's
confidence.
"It's frustrating to see him strug-
gle because I know he was trying so
hard," offensive coordinator Calvin
Magee said.
After the game, Michigan coach
Rich Rodriguez reminded the media
of Robinson's youth. Saturday's
game was only his sixth start, and
that explains some of the missed
reads. Robinson said he was too
excited at times, particularly when
he overthrew Darryl Stonum in the
endzone early in the game.
If there was one thing to take
away from the coaching staff and
players in the postgame press
conferences and interviews, it's
this: Nobodyis concerned about
Robinson. His coaches think he'll
learnfromhis missed reads, and his
teammates think he'll grow from his
struggles.
Robinson addressed his team-
mates in the locker room after the
game, according to slot receiver
Kelvin Grady.
"He told the guys he doesn't
like this feeling. He doesn't ever
want to feel this way again," Grady
said. "I really liked that. It showed
a lot about him. I think he's really
growing as a quarterback and as a
person."
Grady refused to call Robin-
son's performance a "letdown"
SINCLAIR
From Page 1A
At the event on Saturday, Sinclair
said that despite his time in jail for
marijuana possession, he remains
an avid user of the drug. He added
that he is pleased with Ann Arbor's
current policy of fining first-time
violators a fee of $25 for marijua-
na possession instead of making
arrests.
"When I come to Ann Arbor I
don't have to worry about getting
arrested ... it's agoodthing," Sinclair
told the audience, many of whom
were using the drug during his talk.
In addition to discussing the
marijuana incident, Sinclair spoke
of his time as a leader of the White
Panther Party - a civil rights orga-

pus including the University's
chapter of the American Civil Lib-
erties Union and the University's
chapters of the College Democrats
and College Republicans support
the interim policy, but leaders say
more needs to be done to allow for
increased political engagement in
University Housing.
According to a press release
issued by the University's chap-
ter of the American Civil Liber-
ties Union on Friday, the next
logical step for the University is
to allow students living off cam-
pus to canvass in University resi-
dences.
LSA senior Mallory Jones,
chair of the University's ACLU
chapter and a former news edi-
tor for The Michigan Daily, wrote
in an e-mail interview that since
residence halls are composed
primarily of freshmen, these
students may not be able to get
detailed information from more
experienced political canvassers
- who are often upperclassmen -
under the new policy.
"Upperclassmen who don't
live in the residence halls have
experience in political canvass-
ing and knowledge about the Ann
Arbor area that freshimen are still
gathering," she wrote. "If fresh-
men have questions about voting
or certain candidates and issues,
an upperclassman going door-to-
door is much more likely to be able
to help out than a freshman that
has only been on campus a few
weeks."
She added that door-to-door
canvassing, when done in a
respectful way, can be one of the
most effective methods of spread-
ing political knowledge on cam-

pus.
"To have someone come to your
door and ask you if you are regis-
tered to vote will get your atten-
tion, even if seeing a table on the
Diag didn't," she wrote.
LSA junior Brendan Campbell,
chair of the University's chapter
of the College Democrats, said the
group plans to take full advantage
of the canvassing privilege to help
generate interest in politics, but
that the policy is too restrictive.
"We need a permanent solution
that reflects not only the realities
of the First Amendment, but also
the University's purpose of build-
ing an intelligent and informed
citizenry for our state and for our
country," Campbell wrote in the
press release.
LSA senior Charles Bogren,
president of the University's
chapter of the College Repub-
licans, said the College Repub-
licans are pleased to have the
opportunity to canvass in Uni-
versity Housing, but he would
like to see the University reach
out to student groups for input
when developing new policies
related to canvassing.
"We definitely believe that
everyone, whether they live in the
dorms, an apartment or a house,
should be able to be involved in
the political process," Bogren
said. "We try our best to reach out
to voters. For a lot of people on
campus, this is their first chance
to be involved in the (political)
process and be involved in a cam-
paign."
The interim policy will remain
in place until March 2011, and
according to a press release issued
by the College Democrats, the
University has agreed to con-
struct a permanent policy in coop-
eration with the Residence Halls
Association.

Michigan quarterback Denard Robinson ge
and challenged fans who expect
record-breaking numbers from their
quarterback every weekend.
"This doesn't take away from
anything he's done," Grady said.
"He's doinggwell, and lie did fine. He
had a couple of mistakes but it hap-
pens. It's football."
But there's still a problem when
you'vegot an offense that relies
so heavily on one player, particu-
larly with a shaky defense. That one
nization established in 1968 that
was active in Ann Arbor.
"The idea was to build a mass
movement among, basically, young
white people in America to over-
throw the government, to have a
revolution," Sinclair said, sparking
laughter from the audience. "We
thought the idea of building a mass
movement was the only way that
we could make a change."
The party was renamed the
Rainbow People's Party in 1971 to
eliminate violent connotations with
the original name. Sinclair said the
decision to rename the party was
a smart move because it helped
recruit peaceful activists.
In addition to talking about his
life and experiences, Sinclair also
discussed current issues, with top-
ics ranging from the meaning of life

player must play great every week
because even good isn't good enough
to carry the team on his shoulders.
When Robinson accounted for 94
percent of the Wolverines' offense
against Notre Dame a month ago, it
was astonishing - almost laughable.
But nobody's laughing now. Michi-
gan learned in an all-too-painful
way that it can't have a one-player
team with no backup plan. Upcom-
ing opponents will watch the tape
to the current state of downtown
Detroit. When audience members
asked about Detroit, Sinclair said
he was saddened by the hopeless-
ness and desperation enveloping
the city.
"Detroit had its future stripped
from it 35 years ago," Sinclair said.
"All the white people moved out
and took the money and jobs with
them. Flint and Detroit are the
monuments to the utter heartless-
ness of the capitalist system."
University students said they
were enlightened by Sinclair's
words.
"I think it's really great that
(Sinclair spoke)," LSA freshman
Katherine Globerson said. "I think
it's a step toward giving people
another perspective, whether they
agree or not. I hope that there are

of Saturday's game, and they will
mimic Michigan State's defensive
strategies.
"I'm not the only weapon on
offense," Robinson said.
There's a difference between a
handgun and a butter knife, though,
and Michigan needs to have some
more weapons in between.

people here that found this to be
fresh."
LSA freshman Olivia Wallace
said she also enjoyed Sinclair's talk
adding that he is "teaching people
and making them think beyond
what we're sort of conditioned to
think."
At the end of his speech, Sinclair
left audience members with words
of advice. He said. things like the
media and money distract people
from more important pursuits and
it's crucial to band together, share
resources and not sell out.
"Develop a concern for other
people, for humans," Sinclair said.
"It's important to understand more,
and to try and figure out more,
about what it all means. I don't
know myself, but I'm gonna try and
find out."

Al- Oaida inAlgeria seen as threat to Europe RALLY
~ ~ ..L'~From Page lA

Group seeks millions
by kidnapping
Europeans
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -
While Europe's latest terror threat
stems from militants in Pakistan,
a potentially greater menace lies
just across the Mediterranean:
Well-organized and financed
Islamic terrorists from al-Qaida's
North African offshoot.
Over the last month alone, the
group has been accused of seizing
five French nationals and two Afri-
cans from a mining town in Niger,
part of its effort to make millions
by kidnapping Europeans and get-
ting ransoms. It is also blamed for
a truck bombing last Saturday in
Algeria that left five soldiers dead.
DEBATE
From Page 1A
encourage business growth, with
Bernero supporting the tax incen-
tives, while Snyder expressed his
opposition.
"I believe it's a question of
math, not politics," Bernero said.
"If the economic incentives are
working, we're going to use them."
But Snyder said the state needs
a different solution altogether.
"Instead of putting a Band-Aid
on something, let's fix the under-
lying issue," Snyder said. "As we
get our act together, there should
be much fewer needs for incen-
tives in general."
The candidates debated their
plans for improving public edu-
cation in the state, specifically in
regard to providing funding for
higher education.
"We're truly blessed with one
of the best (higher education) sys-
tems in the world," Snyder said.
"But we need to engage them more
in the process."
Both candidates agreed on the
importance of higher education
as a key way to help Michigan
emerge from the recession.
"Education is economic devel-
opment," Bernero said.
Bernero said the state's higher

Al-Qaida in the Islamic
Maghreb effectively rules a wide,
lawless swath of the Sahara and
is trying to overthrow Algeria's
government. It's active online and
media-savvy, and has the globally
recognized al-Qaida brand name.
It has also sparked arrests in Spain
and France.
The question now is how far it
has the will and means to turn its
anger on Europe.
French and U.S. counterintel-
ligence officials suggest AQIM's
logistics and networks aren't yet
mature enough to stage an attack
on a European capital, but say
it's a broad and constant threat.
France's prime minister said Fri-
day that the group is in touch with
fellow fighters in Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
The U.S. military is worried
education focus needs to be on
lowering tuition and keeping
graduates in the state.
"We want to stop the brain
drain," Bernero said.
If elected, Bernero also said
he intends to restore the Michi-
gan Promise Scholarship, which
was cut during the state's budget
negotiations for the 2010 fiscal
year. The scholarship, which the
state funded at a cost of about
$100 million, aided about 96,000
college students in Michigan and
was awarded based on a test taken
in high school. Bernero quickly
pointed out that Snyder opposes
restoring the program, and Syn-
der didn't rebut this statement.
But Snyder did agree that
Michigan's commitment to higher
education is crucial to the state's
success.
"It's one of the great assets of
our state," Snyder said.
The moderators also asked
the candidates about a variety of
social issues like abortion, affir-
mative action and gay marriage
- all of which the two candidates
took opposite stances on.
When asked about affirma-
tive action, Bernero said there's
not much the state can do since
the Michigan Constitution was
amended in 2006 to include an
affirmative action ban. Snyder

enough that it trains African
armies to resist AQIM.
"For years, I've said this - and
we've known - that AQIM has
capabilities to project outwards
outside of Africa. ... It's just that
no one understands the dynamics
from Europe to Africa and back to
Afghanistan," said Rudolph Atal-
lah, retired from his post as Afri-
ca Counterterrorism Director in
the office of the U.S. Secretary of
Defense and who now runs private
security firm White Mountain
Research,
"Can AQIM carry out an attack
in Europe? Yeah, I think so."
For Europe, homegrown ter-
rorists have long been a central
concern. French authorities watch
out for dual nationals who fall
under AQIM's spell, via extremist
websites or preachers in private
said he supports preferences rath-
er than quotas when it comes to
affirmative action.
At the close of the debate, Ber-
nero took the opportunity to high-
light his vision for Michigan's
future, which he says emphasizes
"Main Street" over "Wall Street."
"I believe we can and will make
Michigan work again," Bernero
said.
In his closing remarks, Snyder
said there is a dire need to change
politics in the state in order to get
Michigan up and running again.
"It is time to reinvent Michi-
gan," Snyder said. "The way we're
going to do that is with a clear,
positive vision. We need to move
from being negative to positive."
Brendan Campbell, chair of the
University's chapter of College
Democrats, said he was extreme-
ly happy with Bernero's perfor-
mance during the debate.
"I think the choice is clear for
Michigan students and Michigan-
ders across the country that Virg
Bernero is the candidate that is
most fit to lead the state of Michi-
gan," Campbell said. "He came out
strong tonight."
Campbell said Bernero's
response on public education
really stood out to him. After
watching the debate, Cambell said
Bernero proved he values stu-

prayer meetings in poor suburbs.
Algerian militants who blended
in with Europe's large North Afri-
can immigrant community were
linked to the 2004 Madrid bomb-
ings and killed dozens of people
in the 1990s in attacks in the Paris
Metro.
"If unfortunately a terrorist
operation occurs, it will come from
networks within those European
nations," said Mohand Berkouk,
political scientist at the University
of Algiers who specalizes in Saha-
ra and Sahel geostrategy.
The U.S. government warned
Americans this week of new ter-
ror risks in Europe. Focus fell on
Pakistan, where U.S. drones have
struck suspected al-Qaida targets
and where Pakistani officials say
eight German militants have been
killed.
dents' best interests much more
than his opponent.
"He consistently stresses the
importance that higher educa-
tion plays in Michigan and in the
future of Michigan," Campbell
said.
Charles Bogren, chair of the
University's chapter of College
Republicans, said he was pleased
with Snyder's responses. Berne-
ro's attacks on Snyder were espe-
cially noteworthy, Bogren said.
"I think what stood out the
most was that Virg didn't seem to
really talk about anything other
than how Rick Snyder is apparent-
ly a bad person because he is liv-
ing the American dream," Bogren
said.
Though each candidate con-
veyed their plans for higher edu-
cation well, Bogren said Snyder's
solutions are a better fit for the
state.
"Rick's plan, definitely, espe-
cially when coupled with the rest
of his economic time, is far better
for not only higher education but
for the rest of the state," Bogren
said.
One weakness of Snyder's per-
formance though was his lack of
debate skills, Bogren said.
"He isn't a career politician,"
Bogren said. "He hasn't done mil-
lions of debates in his life."

National Black Justice Coalition,
Adam Taylor, a graduate student
at Grand Valley State University,
Dr. Penny Gardner, president of
Lansing Association for Human
Rights, Cheryl Vandekerkhove, a
member of LAHR, and Veronica
Piechotte, founder of Michigan
Resource Center for Safe Schools.
Cyberbullying has gained
recent attention in Michigan
and the University community
after an assistant attorney gen-
eral for the state of Michigan,
Andrew Shirvell, created a blog
called Chris Armstrong Watch,
which accused the MSA president
of promoting a "radical homo-
sexual agenda" on campus. In
addition, the blog also attacked
Armstrong's friends and family
members.
The issue of cyberbulling has
also gained prevalence across
the nation, as nine students from
across the country committed
suicide in the last few weeks after
they were bullied by peers because
of their sexual orientation.
Each of the speakers empha-
sized that students have always
been subjected to harassment and
bullying, but lawmakers and citi-
zens are finally speaking out in an
effort to stop these behaviors and
call attention to the serious reper-
cussions they can have.
In her speech, Gardner said
respect should be given to every-
one and that the LGBTQ commu-
nity should not have to work to .
earn the respect of others.
Taylor, who gives speeches on
bullying across the country and
has appeared on mtvU during
Suicide Prevention Week, said
parents and schools need to moni-
tor the use of social media sites at
home and in the classroom.

"Students may get online and
harass and bully and say the most
horrendous things you would
never say in person because
there's no one to enforce a reac-
tion to it," Taylor said in an inter-
view before the rally.
At the event, Brown urged gov-
ernment intervention into the
issue of bullying.
"Kids have been killing them-
selves about this for a long time ...
how much longer do we keep say-
ing, 'Well, it gets better.' We have
to reach a point to where we say,
'Let's take the next step. What can
we do?"' Brown said in an inter-
view.
Each of the speakers stressed
the urgency of the issue and
encouraged the public to show
support for safer school environ-
ments and legislation against bul-
lying.
The speakers also offered
ways in which people outside the
LGBTQ community can show sup-
port for the issue and ensure the
rights and respect of members of
the community who face discrim-
ination.
Taylor asked everyone pres-
ent at the rally to enter the phone
number for "The Trevor Project"
in their cell phones, which can be
dialed to report incidents of dis-
crimination or bullying against a
member of the LGBTQ commu-
nity. The Trevor Project is a non-
profit organization that serves as
a suicide prevention hotline for
LGBTQ youth and has answered
more than 100,000 calls since it
began.
David Baum, a Michigan State
University undergraduate stu-
dent who attended the rally, said
he feels the event helped raise
awareness about issues of bully-
ing.
"The speakers were inspira-
tional ... it gives hope for LGBT
youth," he said.

ii Wayne is oniy'Human'
Newest Weezy album should not be hyped&
as jail-born artistry
By Joe Dimuzio I Daily Arts Writer

Music misery
loves company

Three days after releasing
Innervisions, Stevie Wonder got
in a car accident.
While Won-
der was travel-
ing back from a
North Carolina LIJWWI
gig with a friend I Am Not a
at the wheel, a Human Being
trucker slammed Universal Motown
the brakes on a
winding road,
sending Stevie's car straight into
the flatbed's pile of chopped
wood, shooting a stray log
straight through the windshield
and into Stevie's forehead. The
accident left him with bruises,
a brain contusion and a multi-
day coma. He lost his sense of
smell. Gradually recovering, with
his musical talent miraculously
intact, his colleagues alleged that
something had "changed" about
Stevie. With Innervisions, the
American public took the story
and ran with it. Spiritually and
musically, Innervisions was Ste-
vie's defining moment ... but it
was recorded months before the
accident.
Lil Wayne's I Am Not a Human
Being has that Innervisions mys-
tique. Released during his jail
stint for criminal possession of a
firearm, I Am Not a Human Being
can be the magical release Wayne-
heads want. His imprisonment is
the longest period of time Wayne
hasn't spent in the studio, which,
for an artist so prolific, is about as
creatively hampering as a brain
contusion. On his humble "Weezy

Thanx You" website, Wayne has
been responding personally to
fan letters and describing his
daily routine, full of exercise and
bible reading. And now, less than
a month before his release from
Rikers Island, we have our legend
- and an album that betrays it.
Truth is, I Am Not a Human
Being is a collection of old tracks.
Some post-Tha Carter III and
Rebirth and a few whetting, sup-
posed Tha Carter IV cuts. All of
the songs were recorded before
Wayne's lock-up. It's an above-
average mixed bag featuring a bit
more effort than Wayne's mix-
tapes, some highlights, some mid-
dling tracks and a couple duds.
Billed as a return to pure "rap-
ping," Human Being is a moderate
retreat-to-form after February's
already orphaned Rebirth. As a
whole, it's less than cohesive and
lacks the spontaneity of Dedica-
tion 2 and Da Drought 3. Weezy
sounds less than energized here,
and his flow suffers from saggy
wordplay and tired lyrical free-
association. He's got some fine
beats to play with here from a
nice array of varied producers
and collaborators, but on the
whole, Human Being feels a little
pedestrian.
Opener "Gonorrhea" features
Drake (love him or hate him) and
smells like an "A Milli" alternate,
with pipey, staccato keyboards
and a lazy hook. "I Am Not a
Human Being" is a clear Rebirth
leftover, complete with stomping
snares and metal guitar. "What's

Well then, what are you?
Wrong With Them" features
sped-up vocals and somehow
manages to make a track featur-
ing Nicki Minaj dull. These tracks
come and go.
Human Being's best moments
come from unexpected places.
Drake's producer of choice, Noah
"40" Shebib, provides two of the
album's best cuts. "With You" is a
warm slice of soul with a slick Boi-
Ida beat. On "I'm Single," which
bears the mark of another of She-
bib's 2010 highlights (Trey Songz'
druggy "Unfortunate"), Weezy
flows anemic in slow motion, and
when he says "I'm single for the
night," he doesn't sound happy. He
sounds suicidal.
The album series Tha Carter
features Wayne's undeniable shin-

ing moments, and at this point,
the hype for the fourth is astro-
nomical. First single "Right Above
It" (again with Drake) gives us a
taste, building fat, astral trumpets
on a forward-thinking beat and
melody. Here, Wayne doesn't just
feel at ease - he's empowered.
He chuckles, "Life is a beach / I'm
just playing in the sand" while we
listen to the voice of a man behind
bars.
In the end, I Am Not a Human
Being isn't the supernatural, jail-
time Innervisions we need from
pop's best rapper. But if we're one
album away from Wayne's Songs
in the Key of Life - Stevie Won-
der's masterwork after his acci-
dent - then this'll do just fine for
now.

My friend Dave smiles
when I put on Smiley
Smile. He and Itare at
least more-than-casual fans of the
Beach Boys,
and it's one - 1
of their many
albums we ..
enjoy listening
to. I tend toI
skip the first
track "Heroes
and Villains," -
going straight JOE
to "Vegeta- DIMUZIO
bles," because
the second
that songstarts it's impossible to
pay attention to anything else. But
in reality, I could play any number
of Beach Boys songs to entertain
Dave. It could be "Solar System"
from Love You or "Caroline, No"
from Pet Sounds. We get probably
the biggest kick out of "A Day in
the Life of a Tree" and "'TilI Die"
from Surf's Up, two songs writ-
ten by a man in dire artistic and
physical health.
For us, it only makes the music
better.
Behind every one of these songs,
there's a story -usually a miser-
ably sad one - and it has no clear
beginning or end. The Beach Boys
were a beautiful, timeless group
for about ten years. Or at least
that's Iaway I see it. Their early hits
are untouchable, and Pet Sounds is,
well, you should know.
By 1972, the Beach Boys had
gone from America's darlings
to the old uncle at the family
reunion who everyone avoids.
Brian Wilson - the puppy-faced
pop Mozart - had taken enough
acid and coke to ruin his body
and mind, but the Wilson Broth-
ers carried on, with diminishing
returns, both recorded and live:
touting "Brian's Back!" on tours,
dragging him into the studio, ded-
icating an embarrassingly earnest
album sleeve to his "recovery" on
Love You, etc.
Dave and I used to spend
plenty of hours with PetrSounds.
It's easy to love and even easier
to praise. I don't listen to it much
anymore, because I don't need to.
I've moved onto the Boys' records
that are a bit tougher to love. Any
Pitchfork-reading music appre-
ciator can talk miles about Pet
Sounds, butI think the real fun
comes after.
Following one of pop's most
critically acclaimed albums of all
time was, in this case, impossible,
and Brian and the boys failed
beautifully. Locked in what fans
see as his attempt to achieve pop
perfection, Brian plugged away at
his "masterpiece." Smile was to be
the greatest album ever. And after
Pet Sounds, how fucking excited
would you have been?
Instead, we got years of excus-
es, group strife and Brian's emo-
tional and physical downfall, and
some of the most inexplicable and
exciting music the group would
ever release.
Smiley Smile, the afterbirth of
Smile, sounds like an aural acid
casualty. From the batshit mus-

ings of "Vegetables" to the hor-
rifying "Wind Chimes," these
songs stun first, confuse second
and, finally, endear. They were
sparse, strange and empty. There
was room for the story to fill in
the gaps, room for our imagina-
tion to run free. Surf's Up's ending
song cycle features Brian, sound-
ing as though his vocal cords are
seconds from collapse, compar-
ing himself to a tree that wasn't
"meant to live." The Moog-laden,
childlike Love You (my current
favorite Brian production) fea-
tures songs about patting children
on their behind and going roller
skating. One night, my friend Cam
gave the best description I could
conceive for Love You and Brian:
"This is Frankenstein music!"
Brian's story is one of many.
Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim
Morrison, Sly Stone, at least two
of the Beatles - the list goes on.
It's the story of pop music, but
even more, pop stardom. It's the
moment you hear a song and won-
der, what does this person look
like or do on a Saturday night? It's
when you start looking past the
music and looking for a story to
hold onto. When journalists start
asking embarrassingly specific
questions about drug use, and my
parents glance at the TV and ask,
"Who gives a shit?"
A lot of people. A lot of people
give a shit about these stars, and
it's the same reason US Weekly
piles up in barber shops and
TMZ has a television show. It's
that unconscious desperation to
belong to something bigger than
ourselves; to be admired, or at
least paid attention to. Pop stars
Appreciating the
beauty of a
falling pop star.
from Bob Dylan to Jack White
have cultivated that mystery to
build the attention, the persona
and their egos, to astral height.
And in the end, we love to lap
it up. It's like a drug. As Prince
(one of pop's most successfully
preserved cults of personality)
said on 1999, "I'm addicted to your
pleasure. I'm addicted to your
pain."
As I finished typing this, Dave
and I caught the back half of
"(500) Days of Summer" on HBO,
the only part of the movie I've
seen, for probably the fourth time.
I don't like it, but I'm not going to
deny I've paid attention to every
frame during the last four times
it's been on. I told Dave, "I wish
I knew what happened in the
beginning of this. Everything is
so miserable." He responded auto-
matically, with a hint of sarcasm.
"Are you kidding? This is the best
part."
Dimuzio also spends hours with
literal pet sounds. If you have a dog,

Many players will be tempted by
the addition of new team infor-

artist Jakob Kolding illustrates
how this emerging lifestyle cre-

Though Kolding has received
much attention and acclaim in
Europe since he began show-

exhibit is his first solo display

According to UMMA associate
curator of modern and contem-

makes Kolding an ideal artist
for the UMMA Projects series,
which began when the Maxine

kel Family Wing opened last year
and focuses on emerging artists
on an international level.
Kolding mixes his study of
sociology and art to comment on
urban planning and life through

collages and mixed-media sculp-
tures. His collages contain
diverse material like black-od-
white images, cityscape photos,
patterned paper cut into phrases
and his own drawings.
"Collage allows him to com-
bine different spaces, to insert
something into a space that
wouldn't normally be there,"
Proctor said of Kolding's use of
the medium to challenge the ways
people normally view cities. The
medium also acts as a cultural
sampling similar to what you find
in electronic and hip-hop music,
which are important influences
for Kolding.

Love Remains, the debut full-

is a sparse, dimly lit collection of

vocals and the occasional hook

collection of previously released
tracks from over a years' worth
of free EPs all from the bedroom
of Tom Krell, a relative recluse
and avid fan of '90s R&B. Krell's
music isn't so much song-craft as
it is sound-craft, with plenty of
hip signifiers: low fidelity, drum
loops, ounces of reverb. But How

A predictable but
endearing 'Story'

Documentary-style
directors try some
light-hearted fare
By PHILIP CONKLIN
For the Daily
With "It's Kind of a Funny
Story," writing-directing duo Anna
Boden and Ryan
Fleck ("Half Nel-
son", "Sugar")
have departed 's Kind of
from the gritty s a
realism that Funny Story
characterized A
their first movies Atthe State'
in favor of a more Quality16
light-hearted and Rave
tone. This may Focus
seem strange for
a movie that largely takes place in a
mental hospital, but despite its mel-
ancholic setting, the film is gener-
ally pleasant and humorous.
But that's not to sayit's never sad.
Keir Gilchrist (TV's "United States
of Tara") stars as Craig - a suicidal
16-year-old who checks himself
into a mental hospital. Because the
teen ward is undergoing renova-
tions, he finds himself among adult
schizophrenics and drug addicts.
Not surprisingly, he soon realizes
his teenage woes aren't quite as
serious as his fellow patients' prob-
lems. But though Craig realizes this

graffiti," Proctor said. "They're
acting in that environment in a
way that's not how they're sup-
posed to be."
Proctor said Kolding's use of
language within his collages is
more vague than his earlier work,
but Kolding maintains clear state-
ments about urban spaces with his
imagery and rhetoric. Some of his
collages feature cityscape back-
grounds with natural elements
growing through them like grass
growing through cracks in con-
crete - an intriguing commentary
on the blur between urban decline
and urban renewal.
In the framed collage from
2008, "Don't let the bastards grind
you down," one corner features the
Death Star from the "Star Wars"

early on and the audience prob-
ably anticipated it before the open-
ing credits, the idea is continually
harped on throughout the movie.
And, paradoxically, while "Funny
Story" emphasizes the not-so-seri-
ousness of Craig's problems, it also
over-dramatizes them.
And the film is exceedingly pre-
dictable. In the first ten minutes,
a series of obvious questions is set
up. Will Craig hook up with his fel-
low patient, the cute blonde Noelle,
played by Emma Roberts ("Nancy
Drew")? Will Craig's roommate,
a man who hasn't left his room
in years, finally be coaxed out by
Craig's charms? Will an unlikely
friendship form between Craig
and quirky patient Bobby (Zach
Galifianakis, "The Hangover")? But
while you may know where the film
is going, the characters are suffi-
ciently endearing and the dialogue
is witty enough to make the path
enjoyable along the way.
"Funny Story" benefits from
some well executed performances,
most notably by Gilchrist, whose
bashfulness and everyman (or
every-teenager) demeanor makes
him relatable and genuine, even
through the sometimes-forced dia-
logue. Galifianakis also gives an
impressive performance. Although
he's not given free comedic reign,
which could have made a kind-
of-funny film a very-funny film,
his capacity for dramatic acting
series surrounded by the words
"Power, corruption and lies." And
in the collage titled "When was
the future?," an image of a derelict
East German city is juxtaposed
against a background photo of Los
Angeles peeking through in the
lettering.
"Both cities have a whole dif-
ferent utopian idea about what a
city is and can be and should be -
both of which are outmoded at this
point," Proctor said of the collage.
For Kolding's Ann Arbor exhib-
it, Detroit became the ideal inspi-
ration to create original pieces.
Kolding explored Detroit with a
camera to collect material for the
mixed media sculpture, two origi-
nal collages and two posters he
made for the UMMA exhibit.
"He's so interested in cities
like Detroit both because of the
changes and contradictions that
exist within the urban fabric, but
also because of the cultural pro-

is stronger than one might expect
from a comedic actor.
The film is in staunch contrast
with the realistic, documentary-
style filmmaking of the directors'
first two features. For "Funny
Story," they opt instead for a more
nuanced style, characterized by
more carefully composed images
and brighter, whimsical produc-
tion design to match the lighter
tone of this film. But the movie is
also full of visual gimmicks that
often distract from the narrative.
The audience is shown Craig's fan-
tasies (some of them animated),
which sometimes turn into lengthy
digressions that aren't particularly
amusing or informative. It feels like
the filmmakers are trying too hard
to let the audience know they're
making something different this
time around. These asides are
amusing and visually rapturous,
but ultimately don't add much.
And, though it does its best not
to, "Funny Story" sometimes falls
back on the tired tropes of the teen
movie: Craig's best friend is dating
a girl with whom he's "obsessed,"
Craig realizes his best friend is an
asshole, Craig finds out his prob-
lems aren't really that bad, that his
parents really do love him, etc. But
its scope is larger than the aver-
age teen fare, and though it's a bit
heavy-handed in conveying its
themes, "Funny Story" is poignant
and highly enjoyable.
duction," Proctor said of Kolding.
"Musically, Detroit has been such
an important city for so long."
One of the original collages
he made for the exhibit is titled
"Sound Patterns," and the back-
ground features a photo of a park-
inggarage in downtown Detroit. In
one of two posters, which are plas-
tered on two walls and available in
stacks for free, Kolding shaped a
black-and-white image of Detroit
by overlaying a British DJ and the
bright-white words "Urban plan-
ning and local initiatives."
While Kolding's solo exhibit is
housed at UMMA, he is featured
as an artist in the Museum of Con-
temporary Art Detroit's fall show
about imaginary cities, which
Proctor helped arrange.
"The MOCAD show is like a
little satellite of our show," Proctor

another new feature, allegedly
gives each athlete a unique play
style, but characteristics were
indistinguishable from computer
to computer.
The Al and Personality+ need
some improvement, but at least
they take nothing away from the
gameplay. The graphics are still
top notch, human-controlled player
responsiveness is extremely sat-
isfactory and the physics seem
real. Players push each other for
possession of the ball and the
360-degree dribbling adds a lot
of strategic variability. These
changes make dodging players
and sliding between defenders full
of nuance. All this makes it a great
stand-alone game, but its presence
as the latest game in the "FIFA"
genealogy demands much more.
The problem with "FIFA 11"
is EA attempting to justify a $60
title with upgrades totallyunwor-
thy of an additional release.
If you enjoy soccer games and
don't own "FIFA 09" or "10,"
this game wouldn't be a horrible
purchase, but older versions are
half the price. Hopefully one day
someone will inform EA (and
all sports-game makers, for that
matter) about the existence of
patches so they can reward their
fan base with bug removal and
updated roster information with-
out charging them the price of an
original game.

* Robinson, defense struggle in
third straight loss to Spartans

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Editor
Three turnovers and a non-
existent defense does not a victory
make.
Michigan State racked up more
than 530 yards of total offense and
picked off sophomore quarterback
Denard Robinson three times on
its way to a dominant 34-17 win
in front of a packed Michigan Sta-
dium.
It was the most hyped match-
up between the in-state rivals in
recent memory, with both teams
unbeaten and ranked in the top
20. Masses of Michigan State fans
made the hour-long drive to Ann
Arbor to make their presence felt
with chants of "Go Green, Go
White," which echoed throughout

Friday night and into Saturday.
But for all the hype, the game
was largely one-sided. Michigan's
first drive of the game lasted nine
plays with Wolverine running
backs picking up big yardage on
the ground, only to end with Rob-
inson throwing an interception in
the end zone.
It was a sign of things to come.
Michigan routinely put together
good drives only to give the ball up
in the red zone.
The Wolverines scored first on
their second drive on a rare field
goal by redshirt freshman Seth
Broekhuizen. It was Michigan's
first field goal attempt since its
win over Massachusetts, when
Broekhuizen missed his only kick.
Michigan ended the first quar-
ter with a 12-yard sack by redshirt

junior defensive end Ryan Van
Bergen and a 3-0 lead.
It didn't last long.
After the two teams exchanged
three-and-outs to start the second
quarter, Michigan State turned
it on offensively with a 61-yard
touchdown run by sophomore
running back Edwin Baker. Baker
had a great game, with 149 yards
and a touchdown.
The Wolverines answered
with a long drive culminating in
a touchdown pass from Robinson
to senior tight end Martell Webb.
The catch was Webb's first of the
season, and itgave Michigan a 10-7
lead.
But Michigan State wasn't
done. The Spartans broke anoth-
er big play for a score, this time a
41-yard run by freshman running

back Le'Veon Bell. After forcing
a Michigan punt, Michigan State
sophomore kicker Dan Conroy
kicked a 38-yard field goal before
the half. And just like that, Michi-
gan State had a 17-10 lead going
into halftime.
The Michigan defense's inabil-
ity to stop the big play was evident
throughout the game. The unit
allowed three plays of more than
40 yards with two going for scores.
"Until I watch the film, I can't
really tell you where the break-
down was on the two long runs,"
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
said after the game. "We didn't
tackle well and sometimes it
looked like we were going afterthe
ball, maybe pressinga little bit and
trying to strip the ball."

BOWLING GREEN - Heading
on the road for the first time this
season, the Michigan hockey team
felt a great sense of urgency. After
a lackluster tie to unranked Mer-
cyhurst to open the season, the
fourth-ranked Wolverines needed
just one win to give coach Red
Berenson 700 in his career - and
to start their 2010 CCHA season
out on the right note.
With a weekend sweep of
Bowling Green, Michigan (2-0-

son wouldn't dwell on his per-
sonal accomplishment. Instead,
he chose to focus on the team's
series sweep and the adjustments
it needs to make heading into the
rest of the conference season.
Penalties remained an area of
concern for Michigan this week-
end. The Wolverines compiled a
total of 62 minutes in penalties
over both games - including two
checking from behind and game
misconduct calls that led to the
ejections of senior left wing Scoot-
er Vaughn and freshman defense-
man Mac Bennett on Saturday.

BOWLING GREEN -During its
first full week of practices last week,
the No. 4 Michigan ice hockey team
ran extensive special teams drills in
preparation for its two-game week-
end series against Bowling Green.
And when they took the ice
against the Falcons (0-2-0 CCHA,
0-2-0 overall), the Wolverines' spe-
cial teams practice paid off.
Michigan (2-0-0, 2-0-1) racked
up 62 total penalty minutes in its
two wins at the BGSU Ice Arena,
including two game misconducts
for checking from behind to senior

forward Scooter Vaughan atni
freshman defender Mac Bennett in
Saturday's 4-2 win.
But the penalty kill was tolid,
limiting the Falcons - a team that
had torched them for three gower
play goals in their first matchup at
year - to two power play goals t
of 17 attempts in the two games.
"This is a tough time of the v
for power plays to really get it go
because they're just getting stte
confidence," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said after Friday's gte:
"With the penalty killing, I think
it's easier to be a good PK tam
this time of year."

I was writing the annual
dueling column this past
week in light of the Michi-
gan-Michigan State game, I spent
hour upon hour
thinking of
reasons why
Sparty was
inferior.
There were
the obvious
favorites:
"We'll be your
boss someday"; RYAN
"Can't read, KARTJE
can't write";
and especially
anything assuming the Spartans
were Michigan's "Little Brother."
But as I searched for ways to
flair up chat East Lansing inferi-
ority complex, I came across one
argutament that, on several occa-
sions; rubbed sue the wrongiaway:
that tichigan ts. Michigan State
is not a rivalry.
Now, I appreciate a good Michi-
gan State joke as much as the
next person. And I would defend
Michigan's superiority in every
way, shape or form without any
hesitation.
But it's simply foolish to say this
matchup is not a rivalry.
Yes, Michigan leads the all-
time series by an enormous mar-
gin - 67-31-5, to be exact. Yes, the
Wolverines boast a ridiculously
one-sided comparison in nearly
every category of the record
books. And yes, Michigan State
may never get rid of that complex,
which comes full swing the week
before this game every year.
But the truth is, the Spartans
have clearly outplayed Michigan
in the team's past three meet-
ings, and Michigan State is start-
ing to look pretty damn good on
the gridiron. With no matchup
against Ohio State on its schedule
this year, Sparty could even, dare
I say it, make a run at the Rose
Bowl.
"Maybe someday the little
brother grows up and can at least
compete with the big brother and
makes it a game every week,"
Michigan State coach Mark Dan-
tonio said after the game.
And he's right, to some extent:
This is going to be a game for
years to come.
It's not even what happens on
the field, though, that makes this
the rivalry what it is. Students all
over campus were forced to put

like this one proves plain and sim-
ple that Michigan fans care about
this intrastate matchup, whether
they want to admit it or not.
Think about it. For the Wol-
verines' unblemished record to
be tainted by the Spartans hurts
much more than if Michigan
would've lost to, say, Iowa or two
weeks after that to Penn State.
For those at the Daily, we under-
stand this rivalry all too well.
The Daily takes on the State
News in a pretty serious touch
football game every year, which
the Daily had won five years in a
row entering Friday night's game.
After the first half, it looked as
though the tables might be turn-
ing, as Michigan State's student
newspaper had a fairly com-
manding three-touchdown lead.
Despite having won five years in
a rouw, despite the confidence we
had heading into the game, my fel-
low writers and I were in danger
of being the first group to lose in
the matchup in half a decade.
This didn't settle well with any

of us. We had lost games before,
but none of us had lost to the
State News. That loss to that team
would've hurt unlike any other
game we might lose to any other
team (Ohio State's student news-
paper, included).
Needless to say, the Daily came
back and won the game in double
overtime, just minutes before the
lights were turned off on Elbel
Field.
We had earned bragging rights
for the sixth year in a row, and
most of us who played probably
can't tell you a touch football
game that has meant more in our
entire lives.
That's because our brother in
East Lansing, little or not, is our
rival.
And just like any brother, we're
going to be stuck with them for a
very long time, whether we like it
or not.

They say that you learn the most
about a team when it's down. if
that's the
case, the MICHIGAN 3
Michigan WISCONSIN 2
men's
soccer team should be in good
shape after its first come-from-
behind victory of the year.
Yesterday, the Wolverines trav-
eled to Madison to take on Big Ten
foe Wisconsin.
And early on, it looked like
Michigan might be in some trouble
against the lowly Badgers.
Wisconsin (0-1-1 Big Ten, 1-8-2
overall) came out of the gate ready
to play and quickly captured a
1-0 lead, on a 12th minute goal by
junior defenseman Colin Mani.
But the Wolverines (2-1 0, 7-2-
3) refused to point fingers at one
another - instead, they used the
early deficit as fuel to turn the game
around and earn a 3-2 victory.
"The great thing about what
happened after we got down is you
really saw the team's resolve to play
for each other," Michigan coach
Steve Burns said after the game.
"You started to see everybody kind
of think the same and move theiball
effectively, and really just trust one
another. I think we became a much
better team after we went down a
goal."
In the 17th minute of the first
half - just five minutes after
the Badgers scored - Michigan
responded with a goal of its own by
senior forward Justin Meram.
Meram capitalized on a Wiscon-

sin turnover and sliced through the
Badger defense, drilling the ball
into the lower-right corner to even
the score up at one.
"The timing of (Meram's goal)
was very strong because the lon-
ger that you go being down a goal,
the more uptight everyone can get
and you start to press and do things
you wouldn't normally do," Burns
said. "After that goal, you could
see that we kind of shook off their
first goal and said, 'Okay, let's keep
after them and figure out how to
get more.'"
The goal was Meram's fifth of
the season and his third in the
last three games. Meram's recent
surge is a welcome sight for the
Wolverines and can be partially
attributed to his new approach to
the game.
"I'm just staying focused with
the team goal," Meram said.
"Before, I was worrying too much
about not scoring - now it's more
about Michigan winning and my
ability to help Michigan win by get-
ting a couple goals here and there
and setting people up. The less I
was thinking about scoring and
just thinking more about Michigan
is when my chances were coming."
Minutes before the end of the
first half, freshman forward Soony
Saad fired the ball into the back
of the net off of a free kick to give
Michigan momentum and a 2-1
lead heading into halftime.
The Wolverines would carry
that momentum into the second
half, as they came out of the break
controlling the ball and getting
everyone involved.
Just over 12 minutes into the

second half, senior Matt Schmitt
added a goal to give Michigan a
commanding 3-1lead.
With the comfortable two-goal
lead, Burns pulled redshirt junior
goalie Chris Blais in order to give
redshirt sophomore Tim Bergsma
his first action of the season.
But after a defensive breakdown
by the Wolverines, Wisconsin
freshman Chris Prince scored to
cut the lead to one with just under
seven minutes to play.
Minutes later, Wisconsin had a
great chance to tie the game off of
a corner kick but was stopped on a
diving save byBergsma, sealing the
victory for Michigan.
"As a keeper, you've got to have
the shortest memory on the team,"
Bergsma said. "Whether you make
a big save or give up a goal, you just
have to get right back at it."
Burns's confidence in Bergsma
to finish out the game is a great
example of how much trust this
team has built in one another -
from the starters all the way down
to the last player on the bench.
And with the Big Ten Tourna-
ment less than a month away, trust
will be key as the Wolverines look
to make a run at the conference
title.
"Bergs had to make a great save
at 3-2 and he did," Burns said. "The
teamhas gotctrustin him and really
I think we are now truly becoming
a a team. You trust that every guy
that comes onto the field is going
to be able to sustain the work, and
it starts to all synch the same. It's
good to see. Everybody who came
into the game tonight really did a
strong job for us."

J' flexes muscles in draw

DELI

Daily Sports Writer
For years, Michigan's wom-
en's soccer has struggled might-
ily against
Michigani MICH GAN ST. 0
State, as the MICHIGAN 0
Spartans
have simply had more talent.
But on Saturday night the tables
were turned.
This time, the Wolverines clearly
outplayed the Spartans. While the
result was the same as the past
years, as the intrastate rivalry
ended in a 0-0 draw, it was clear the

talent gap has been closed.
"I am so proud of the girls,"
Michigan coach Greg Ryan said
after the game. "For two years
we've had to sit back and defend for
90 minutes, and this year we have
enough talent to go forward and go
after teams."
Even though the Wolverines
(0-1-2 Big Ten, 5-2-4 overall) fin-
ished tied with the Spartans (2-1-1,
7-3-2) in shots on goal with three,
the edge in possession and attack-
ing play clearly belonged to Michi-
gan.
The Wolverines had chances, as
senior Jackie Carron nearly con-

nected on a strike from 40 yards
out and freshman Meghan Toohey
just missed on both a free kick and
one-two pass through the Spartan
backline. Carron's impact didn't
only come offensively, as she made
the play of the day on a desperate
slide tackle to bail the defense out of
a Michigan State breakaway.
The ability to play positive soccer
instead of negative, defensive soc-
cer against their rival was impor-
tant for Ryan.
"I think you're seeing teams fall
to Michigan State, but we took the
game to them," said Ryan. "I feel
very positive about it. This was a
team that for two years hasn't been
able to do this, but now we're able
to go after teams. Now we need
just a bit of better quality when
it comes to creating chances and
putting them away. "
Senior Sarah Stanczyk was one
of the best players on the field, put-
ting in tremendous work in playing
the full 110 minutes of regulation
and overtime. Marking the Spar-
tans' talented forward Laura Hey-
boer, Stanczyk was able to hold the
dangerous striker to no shots.
Still, as much as Stanczyk was

told that Michigan State was just
another game, playing in her final
outing of this rivalry took on a spe-
cial meaning for the Grosse Pointe,
Michigan native.
"It's a very passionate rivalry
for me," Stanczyk said. "I've been *
thinking of this game all week,
waking up every morning excited
to play Michigan State. I know half
the team, Iplayed with thembefore
I came to college, so it runs a little
deeperthan just an in-state rivalry."
The most dynamic player on the
day, however, was Meghan Toohey,
who controlled the offense and
showed poise in the center of mid-
field by dictating tempo in a chaotic
game. Still, Toohey's own good play
didn't mitigate her dissatisfaction
of a lost victory.
"This is just another step in
the beginning of our season that
shows us what we can accomplish,"
Toohey said. "Overall, I am happy
that we played so well, it just sucks
that we didn't get the win."

It wasn't until Roundtree

Roundtree said after the game.

receiver who made a few agoniz-
ing mistakes in the Wolverines'
34-17 loss to the Spartans.
In fact, many of the explana-
tions Michigan (1-1 Big Ten, 5-1
overall) players gave after the
loss centered around their own
mistakes on both sides of the ball
- mistakes that made the game
too far out of reach, especially
against a poised team like Michi-
gan State.
"There's nothing on the field
that went wrong that can't be
fixed," redshirt junior slot receiv-
er Kelvin Grady said. "We had a
couple of things that went wrong,
a couple of dropped balls - that
can be fixed."
None of the drives were more
frustrating for the maize and
blue, however, than the Wolver-
ines' drive late in the third quar-
ter when Robinson passed three
balls to three different receivers
- a different wideout on first,
second and third down - all of
which were dropped.
Robinson ended the game with

his worst completion percentage
of the year - 17 completions on
29 attempts - but the mistakes
made by his wideouts definitely
contributed to the Michigan
quarterback's worst performance
of the season.
TROUBLES IN THE GAP: For
much of the game, Michigan's
pass rush seemed to be in top
form.
Michigan State quarterback
Kirk Cousins, a natural pocket
passer, was forced to make quick-
er reads and scramble more than
usual as defensive linemen like
junior nose tackle Mike Martin
spent more time in the backfield
than they had in previous games.
And through the past three
games, the Wolverines have tal-
lied a three-sack effort (against
Bowling Green) and a pair of
two-sack efforts (against Michi-
gan State and Indiana).
"We were getting pressure on
the quarterback all day," fresh-
man defensive end Jibreel Black
said. "We just let up a few big

plays and that's kind of where
they got us."
But the line's play against the
pass wasn't the issue on Saturday.
Coupled with the linebackers,
the defensive line struggled to
fill running lanes, giving Spar-
tan running backs Edwin Baker,
Le'Veon Bell and Larry Caper
ample room to bust big runs.
"We just had miscommuni-
cation on who's got what gap,"
redshirt junior defensive line-
man Ryan Van Bergen said. "It's
simple. Run defense is simple.
Everyone has one gap and you're
accountable for that gap. We
weren't in the right one twice,
same play."
Those two plays resulted in
a 61-yard sprint from Baker and
a 41-yard run from Bell, both
for touchdowns, which gave the
Spartans a great deal of momen-
tum heading into the half.
The touchdowns runs were
the two longest running scores
the Wolverines have given up all
season.

week," Schilling said. "It's one
of our goals on offense every
week, to not have any turn-
overs. Obviously you see that
when you have turnovers things
don't go your way and you lose
games."
As a team, Michigan threw
one interception and lost four
fumbles in five games before
Saturday. And when Robinson
threw his third interception
of the game early in the fourth
quarter, the Wolverines were
down just 14 points despite the
missed opportunities.
"Everybody gets frustrated
when they lose," Smith said.

TO PUNT OR NOT TO PUNT:
With 5:41 remaining in the
game and Michigan trailing by
17 points, coach Rich Rodriguez
sent freshman punter Will Hag-
erup out to give the ball back to
the Spartans. His decision was
met with resounding boos from
Michigan fans, and the Wolver-
ines never got the ball back.
After the game, Rodriguez
admitted that it may have been
the wrong call.
"It was probably a mistake,"
Rodriguez said. "I thought we'd
get a quick turnaround and
maybe get a minute-and-a-half
or two minutes off the clock
and have it ... If I had do-overs, I
wouldn't punt."

Ah, the first non-4/4 given to the Michigan quarter-

earth, rushing for 86 yards and passing for 215 while
also throwing three interceptions. He led some nice
drives, but his two picks in the MSU endzone were killer.

guez was less than demonstrative. Instead of frustrated

somewhat worried. Perhaps we'll see a bit more emo-
