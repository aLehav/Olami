Research finds 
venture capitalists 
could contribute to 

discrepancies

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Female-led startup companies 

do not perform as well as 
their male-led counterparts 
in part because of gender 
discrepancies among venture 
capitalists, according to recent 
University research.

This gap in performance, 

the research suggests, is due 
to the majority male-driven 
nature of venture financing 
syndicates.

The study, conducted by 

Business 
Ph.D. 
candidate 

Sahil Raina, found there was 
a 25 to 30 percent difference 
in the average performance 
rates of male-led startups 
and 
female-led 
startups, 

with male-led startups more 

successful overall. Findings 
indicated that the difference 
in rates depended on whether 
the companies were initially 
financed by venture capital 
partners with at least one 
female general partner in the 
financing syndicate, or if the 
syndicate was all male.

Raina said his interest in this 

research began after reading 
that female entrepreneurs in 
Silicon Valley were having 
trouble working with venture 
capitalists. However, because 
the stories he read were 
lacking empirical evidence, 
Raina decided to study the 
issue himself.

Venture capital financing 

works by offering money to 
startup companies in rounds 
until 
the 
company 
either 

goes public or is bought by 
another company. Companies 
pitch their startups to firms 
and 
work 
toward 
gaining 

their own funding during the 
process. At that point, the 
venture capitalists have the 

Taubman partners 

with schools for 

architecture 
workshops

Twenty-five Detroit Public 

Schools high school students 
graduated from a preparatory 

architecture program hosted 
by 
the 
Taubman 
College 

of 
Architecture 
and 
Urban 

Planning Monday night.

The 
semester-long 
joint 

workshop 
program, 
called 

the 
Michigan 
Architecture 

Prep Program, was created to 
expose DPS students to the 
field of architecture and job 
opportunities in related fields. 
The University has launched 
multiple programs in past years 
to better connect with cities 
across the state. 

The 
program, 
which 

launched in December 2014, 
allows Taubman faculty and 
DPS staff to interact and work 
together to develop workshops 
for students interested in the 
field.

Milton Curry, associate dean 

of academic affairs and strategic 
initiatives 
in 
the 
Taubman 

College of Architecture and 
Urban Planning, said Detroit 
was chosen as the site for the 
program because of the city’s 
history with the University.

“The University of Michigan 

has a historic role in that it 

was founded in Detroit,” Curry 
said. “It has a responsibility as 
a public university — one of the 
premier public universities — to 
be a leader.”

Irene 
Nordé, 
executive 

director 
for 
the 
Office 
of 

Mathematics 
Education 
in 

Detroit Public Schools, said 
she thought the program was 
highly beneficial for students. 
She noted that for the program 
to 
work, 
several 
logistical 

measures were taken by DPS.

Company fires, 
demotes writers, 

editors and 

photographers 

By MEGAN DOYLE

Daily Staff Reporters

MLive 
Media 
Group 

announced Wednesday on their 
website that multiple positions 
would be eliminated in the latest 
restructuring move to impact 
the Ann Arbor News.

 According to a statement 

on 
Mlive’s 
website 
from 

John Hiner, vice president of 
content, 29 “content positions” 
were eliminated in an effort 
to restructure the company. 
Though the layoff may include 
Ann Arbor editors, reporters and 
photographers, the statement 
notes that the number of content 
positions 
remain 
the 
same 

overall statewide.

 Along with the Ann Arbor 

News, MLive also owns multiple 
other newspapers across the 
state. It was formed in 2012 when 
it ombined MLive.com with eight 
newspapers across the state of 
Michigan in Ann Arbor, Grand 
Rapids, Kalamazoo, Muskegon, 
Jackson, Flint, Saginaw and Bay 
City. Combined, it has the largest 
audience of any media company 
in Michigan — the website has 
a monthly digital readership of 
more than 11 million people.

 The changes aim to “(direct) 

resources to emerging content 
and 
business 
opportunities, 

while 
reducing 
some 

management, 
support 
and 

production roles,” according to 
the statement.

 When asked to comment 

further, Hiner wrote in an 
e-mail 
to 
The 
Michigan 

Dailythat MLive would not be 
disclosing the specific details of 
the internal restructuring at this 
time.

 “At this point … we’re going to 

let the article we posted stand, in 
terms of public comment by our 
organization,” he wrote.

 The announcement is the 

latest in a series of similar moves 
for newspaper outlets in the 
state. Last month, 13 journalists 
at the Detroit News accepted 
a buyout. Buyouts have also 
occurred at the Detroit Free 
Press recently.

 
These buyouts have become 

common at newspapers outside 
the state as well, including at 
The New York Times and the 
Washington Post.

 The full list of positions that 

will be impacted or eliminated 
by the changes at MLive have 
not been released by the media 
group, though some employees 
have 
publically 
announced 

changes. Paula Gardner, the 
former Ann Arbor editor at 
MLive, tweetedthat she will 
now be reporting Michigan 
business news for the company, 
but declined comment when 
contacted 
by 
The 
Michigan 

Daily.

 For some, the move to 

eliminate 
content 
positions 

has sparked concern about the 
quality of coverage in Ann Arbor 
and beyond.

Grouup also 
continues 

examining faculty 
role in admissions

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs met Monday to discuss 
changes to several documents 
that govern faculty policy at 
the University. 

At 
a 
December 
SACUA 

meeting, University President 
Mark Schlissel addressed the 
assembly on possible changes 
to the Principles of Faculty 
Involvement Blue Document 
that would increase faculty 
involvement in undergraduate 
admissions.

The document, which describes 

the 
general 
responsibilities 

faculty 
members 
have 
in 

governing the University, has 

not been revised since the Senate 
Assembly endorsed its second 
edition in 2008.

During 
the 
December 

meeting, many members of 
SACUA said they felt the 
document should be further 
amended to address the role 
faculty play in undergraduate 
admissions.

At 
Monday’s 
meeting, 

SACUA 
members 
presented 

possible 
revisions 
to 
the 

document, 
concerning 

several 
aspects 
including 

the faculty involvement in 
undergraduate 
admissions, 

faculty involvement in faculty 
disciplines and the definition 
of faculty sections.

Revisions to the definition 

of faculty within the principles 
sparked a discussion among 
the 
members. 
Kinesiology 

Prof. Stefan Szymanski said 
the 
current 
definition 
of 

faculty is too ambiguous, and 
said SACUA should address 
whether administrators are 
also considered faculty.

“The point is that the things 

that they are doing, they are not 
doing as faculty, they are doing 
as administrators, so that’s 
what we need to establish,” 
Szymanski said.

Comparative 
Literature 

Prof. 
Silke-Maria 
Weineck, 

SACUA chair, said SACUA will 
work to outline the difference 
between a faculty member and 
an administrator.

“We need to have a very 

clear memo that lays out what 
we mean by faculty,” Weineck 
said. “We don’t want to take 
their power, we just want to say 
in document defining faculty 
from administrators.”

SACUA plans to work on 

the Principles document over 
the next few weeks and will 
discuss its conclusions with 
University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack and Schlissel when they 
have reached a conclusion. Until 
formal suggestions have been 
made, SACUA will continue to 
adhere to the current guidelines.

A personal 

remembrance of 
David Bowie, the 
rocker from Mars

By ADAM THEISEN

Managing Arts Editor

There’s a scene in the 

movie “Velvet Goldmine” 
where 
Christian 
Bale’s 

character 
is 
with 
his 

parents watching a David 
Bowie-inspired ’70s glam-
rocker 
character 
give 
a 

press conference on TV. 
The Bowie character talks 
openly to reporters about 
his 
attraction 
to 
men, 

smirking to himself at how 
scandalous he’s being, and 
Bale’s character imagines 
himself jumping up and 
down, pointing at the TV, 
yelling to his parents “That’s 
me! That’s me!”

That’s exactly how I felt 

when I first got into Bowie. 
I was about 14 and I was 
realizing that my feelings 
toward boys weren’t what 
one would call normal and 
I was freaking out because 
I didn’t understand it, and 
I didn’t even know any gay 
adults who could provide 
any sort of blueprint for 
what this meant now that my 
entire perception of myself 
had been blown up. So I went 
to Google and found David 
Bowie, one of the queerest 
straight men to ever exist, 
an artist who explained so

Exposure to negative 
stereotypes increased 
support for restrictive 

policies

By SAMIHA MATIN

Daily Staff Reporter

Recent 
University 
studies 

suggest individuals who identify 
as non-Muslim and are exposed 
to negative portrayals of Mus-
lims in the media are more likely 
to support restrictive public pol-
icies aimed at Muslims interna-
tionally and domestically.

Communications Prof. Muni-

ba Saleem, a faculty associate at 
the Institute for Social Research, 
spearheaded the research proj-
ect. The project consisted of 
three separate studies that dis-
played 
various 
mechanisms 

through which stereotypes, as 
identified by researchers in the 
media, can cause individuals to 

deem Muslims as aggressive and 
consequently support policies 
that target them.

The participants in each 

study all identified as non-
Muslim but varied in race and 
gender. After being exposed to 
media clips that featured nega-
tive portrayals of Muslims, the 
participants were then polled on 
policies deemed by the research-
ers as harmful toward Muslim 
Americans.

In an interview, Saleem said 

the results of the three studies 
emphasize how media portray-
als influence public opinion.

“This work highlights the 

importance of media depictions 
in influencing support for pub-
lic policies that don’t just harm 
Muslims 
internationally, 
but 

even those who are our fellow 
American citizens,” she said. 
“This is especially important 
when we consider that most 
Americans have little to no 
direct contact with Muslims and 
often rely on media to get infor-

mation about Muslims.”

Specifically, after exposure 

to news stories where Muslims 
were described as terrorists, 
participants 
correspondingly 

showed support for military 
actions in Muslim countries to 
reduce the influence of Islam. 
They also supported actions 
such as secretly monitoring 
Muslim 
Americans 
without 

their consent, not allowing them 
the right to vote and requiring 
them to go through separate, 
more scrutinized airport secu-
rity lines.

“These perceptions, in turn, 

can create hostile expectations 
and anger by some non-Mus-
lims, who may exhibit aggres-
sive behaviors,” Saleem said.

However, she noted that the 

study also found that support 
for such policies is significantly 
reduced when participants were 
exposed to news that portrayed 
Muslims in a neutral or positive 
light.

“If media representation of 

Muslims was more balanced and 
positive, we would not see such 
negative attitudes towards Mus-
lims and support for policies 
that harm them,” she said.

Although the research was 

useful in showing short-term 
effects, Saleem said she hopes 
to carry out research that exam-
ines the long-term effects of ter-
rorism news on attitudes toward 
Muslims.

Law student Omar El-Halwa-

gi, co-president of the Muslim 
Law Students Association at 
the University, said though the 
study shows how the media can 
influence the opinions of non-
Muslim 
Americans, 
encour-

aging non-muslim support of 
anti-Muslim policies, he hopes 
more research will show how 
Muslims, particularly Muslim 
students, are impacted.

“When a presidential can-

didate’s poll numbers increase 
when he espouses an Islamo-
phobic stance, it makes Muslim 
students here have to focus on 
more just their contracts read-
ing,” El-Halwagi said. “Feeling

taught you?

Patience. Patience. 
Because, among other 
things, I’m a firm believer 
in the saying that’s often 
used in the blues that it’s 

not the notes you play, it’s 
the notes you don’t play 
that are important, or a 
close corollary to that: It’s 
not how many notes you 
play, it’s the space between 
them, and I think that’s 
really like a metaphor for 
life in general. 

You are known for being 
a lot of different things 
including a scholar, 
musician, professor, 
historian and curator, as 
well as many more. What 
achievement or identity 
are you most proud of?

I don’t think I’m 
particularly prouder of 
any of those things than 
I am just the idea that I 
think I’m a decent human 

being. I’d like to think that 
who I am as a person is the 
thing that I am proudest 
of because I think that I’m 
an honest, I think that I’m 
a caring, I think that I’m a 
loving, thoughtful human 
being who’s always trying 
to make himself a little bit 
better.

How do you define 
success?

Happiness. Personal 
happiness. Personal 
happiness and the ability to 
know that you have defined 
yourself.

‘U’ professor 
says expansion 

to India will have 
significant impact

By BECCA SOLBERG

Daily Staff Reporter

A 
key 
component 
in 

the 
cultural 
phenomenon 

“Netflix and Chill” has gone 
global.

Netflix 
announced 
on 

Jan. 6 that the company is 
embarking on a huge new 
year’s resolution for 2016: 
expanding to 130 countries 
new countries.

In an interview with the 

Daily, 
Puneet 
Manchanda, 

a 
professor 
in 
the 
Ross 

School of Business, said the 
comanpies expansion to India 

in particular was significant, 
citing economy, growth and 
strategy as motives for the 
company’s expansion.

Manchanda said because 

Netflix is seen as a hyper 
global company, in order to 
keep growing it needs to find 
new markets. He said the 
expansion also relies on high-
speed internet access, which 
has a large market size in 
countries like India.

“The rest of the world 

has about six times as many 
broadband subscribers than 
the U.S.,” Manchanda said. 
“So this is one way they can 
grow by expanding into new 
markets because the market 
size is quite big.” 

Additionally, 
since 
the 

company currently provides 
hugely popular content, such 
as shows like “Daredevil,” 
“Jessica Jones” and “Narcos,” 

Manchanda said he thinks 
Netflix wants to share the 
content 
with 
the 
largest 

population possible. He said 
by expanding into India, it will 
be able to expand it’s audience 
on 
these 
Netflix 
original 

shows, as well as others.

“They become a worldwide 

channel, and that’s part of their 
strategy,” Manchanda said.

As well, Manchanda said 

as Netflix distributes content 
produced 
by 
studios 
and 

TV companies, the larger 
audience 
may 
increase 

content providers’ drive to 
give 
Netflix 
distribution 

rights.

LSA junior Chloe Herl, 

who currently has a Netflix 
subscription, 
said 
she 
is 

excited to watch global films 
once Netflix receives rights to 
global content from countries

Raina said. “Venture capital 
financing provides money to 
early stage startups — like 
high-tech startups that aren’t 
public.”

Raina 
used 
CrunchBase, 

a database for the high-tech 
sector, to collect information 
on over 10,000 venture capital 
financing rounds and about 
3,600 startups.

CrunchBase 
included 
the 

names of the entrepreneurs 
who founded the startups as 
well as the names of the general 
partners who were leading 
the venture capitals, allowing 
Raina to use the names to 
assign gender to all of the 
people in the sample.

For the names Raina said 

he 
could 
not 
immediately 

assign a gender to — such as 
gender-ambiguous names or 
those that were uncommon 
American names — he used 
online resources to try to 

determine if they were male 
or female. Names that weren’t 
distinguishable were excluded 
from the study.

According to Raina, about 10 

percent of the entrepreneurs 
in the sample were women, 
and only about 15 percent 
of the startups had just one 
female founder. Overall, in 
entrepreneurship in the United 
States, about 36 percent of small 
businwesses 
have 
majority 

female ownership, Raina said.

Raina said he wanted to 

explore specifically whether 
the 
performance 
of 
the 

startups differed by either the 
gender of startup’s founder or 
the venture capitalist funding 
it. For the purpose of the study, 
success was determined by 
whether 
venture 
capitalists 

exited a project, signalling it 
was either public or had been 
bought by another company.

“For startups that had only 

male founders, I found they 
had an exit rate of about 27 
percent,” Raina said. “But for 
startups that had at least one 
woman founder, the exit rate 
was more like 17 percent.”

Considering 
the 
10 

percentage point difference, 
Raina then examined whether 
venture capital financing or 

advising might play a role in the 
gender gap.

He looked at rounds that 

had at least one female general 
partner 
in 
the 
financing 

syndicate 
versus 
financing 

rounds with all male partners 
in the syndicate, and compared 
the startups that were financed 
in these two types of financing 
rounds.

Startups that were financed 

by either of these two groups 
had similar proportions of 
their portfolios led by women 
founders, 
according 
to 
the 

study. In both venture capital 
groups, about 16.5 percent of 
the portfolios were startups led 
by women founders.

For 
male-led 
startups, 

there 
was 
no 
difference 

in 
performance 
based 
on 

whether they were financed 
by a syndicate with all male 
partners or by a syndicate with 
at least one female partner. 
On average, male-led startups 
successfully exited at 21 to 22 
percent of the time.

Among syndicates that had 

at least one female general 
partner, there was no difference 
in the average performance 
rates of male- led startups 
and female-led startups they 
funded. However, for financing 

syndicates that had all male 
general partners, there was a 25 
to 30 percent difference in the 
average performance rates of 
male and female-led startups.

“All of this difference is 

coming from the female-led 
startups doing much better 
when they are initially financed 
by a syndicate run by at least 
one female GP,” Raina said.

Raina 
said 
this 
makes 

him believe that the venture 
capitalists with female general 
partners are able to better 
select female-led startups, and 
this implies that some valuable 
startups might not succeed 
depending on who is financing 
them.

Finance 
Prof. 
Sugato 

Bhattacharyya, chair of Raina’s 
dissertation committee, said 
the most intriguing part of 
Raina’s 
research 
was 
that 

venture capitalist groups with 
women as partners effectively 
selected firms with women 
better.

“What it comes down to 

eventually is the notion that 
when people look at women’s 
participation in whatever way 
in this sub-area, one culprit 
that held up is the widely 
known demographic fact, at 
least in North America, women 

tend to go less into STEM 
fields historically,” he said. 
“That in itself might be causing 
disparity.”

Given the results, Raina 

said along with emphasis on 
STEM — science, technology, 
engineering and math majors 
— it may be beneficial to 
encourage women to go into 
venture capitalism or finance-
related majors as well. He 
said encouraging women to 
work in venture capital will 
result in higher participation 
and 
success 
for 
female 

entrepreneurs.

Bhattacharyya 
noted, 

however, 
that 
because 
the 

research 
is 
ongoing, 
it 
is 

difficult to say definitively 
whether a disparity among 
startups exists.

“These things are never 

static,” 
Bhattacharyya 
said. 

“They evolve. By the time we 
find that in 1996 a big disparity 
existed and then in 2015, is 
it relevant or is it not? By this 
time there will be more women 
capitalists, 
more 
women 

entrepreneurs, and maybe it 
doesn’t exist anymore.”

 Currently, The Michigan 

Daily is the only media in 
Ann Arbor to publish as a 
daily print newspaper. The 
Ann Arbor News maintained 
a daily print news cycle 
until July 2009. It currently 
publishes 
daily 
online 
at 

MLive.com, 
but 
produces 

print 
editions 
only 
on 

Thursdays and Sundays.

 
Anthony 
Collings, 
a 

University 
lecturer 
in 
the 

Department of Communication 
who focuses on journalism and 
media, said he was concerned 
the changes could lead to less 
local coverage in Ann Arbor.

 With 18 years of experience 

reading the Ann Arbor News, 
Collings said he has become 

increasingly dissatisfied with 
the level and quality of the 
paper’s local coverage, and 
now reads it rarely.

 “From what I’ve seen 

of (the Ann Arbor News), 
they rewrite press releases, 
they boost local businesses, 
they tell you about cool 
restaurants,” Collings said. 
“That’s fine, I’m all in favor 
of food and travel, but you 
also need to do the quality 
journalism. 
You 
need 
to 

investigate 
problems. 
This 

town 
has 
problems, 
like 

any place. Where is the 
journalism? Where is the 
accountability reporting?”

 No media organization has 

filled the niche of providing 
local coverage over past years, 
Collings said.

 “Ann Arbor needs good 

coverage,” Collings said. “The 

Daily is fine, but the Daily does 
a lot of focus on the campus. 
It’s a student newspaper. 
There isn’t a really good daily 
news organization covering 
Ann Arbor the way it should 
be covered.”

 Collings added that he 

believes the problem goes 
beyond Ann Arbor and is 
something that’s also missing 
in Michigan and beyond, 
citing coverage of the Flint 
water crisis in particular as an 
example of statewide failings 
in investigative journalism.

“Generally, 
journalism 

in 
the 
United 
States 
is 

undergoing a crisis. Buyouts, 
layoffs and other forms of 
staff reduction — that’s all bad 
news for the public, because 
less journalists means less 
coverage of stories that need 
to be covered,” he said.

one: get them credit for doing 
the work,” Nordé said. “And 
two: that it had to be aligned 
with 
college 
and 
career 

readiness standards.”

 After adding the program 

as a course to the DPS 
catalogue, participating high 
schools also arranged busing 
and scheduling so students 
could participate.

 According to Nordé, some 

students attended the prep 
program 
in 
the 
morning 

while others attended during 
the afternoon. Busing was 
arranged by DPS to transport 
the students to and from 
the 
midtown 
architecture 

research studio back to their 
high schools, where students 
would 
then 
attend 
their 

regular classes.

“This was a phenomenal 

opportunity 
for 
students,” 

Nordé said.

In a speech during the 

graduation ceremony, Maurice 
Cox, the city of Detroit’s 
planning 
and 
development 

director, encouraged students 
to explore new opportunities 
and step out of their comfort 
zones.

“You have been taught a 

level of abstraction, a level of 
creative thinking that most 
of your peers back at school 
have not been exposed to,” 
he said. “The fact that you 
succeeded should give you 
enormous confidence.”

 
Diamond 
Long, 
Cass 

Technical 
High 
School 

junior who participated in 
the program, said she was 
grateful for the chance to 
be exposed to college-level 

architecture standards and 
criticism.

“At 
first 
I 
struggled 

because at first we were 
doing a lot of free-hand 
stuff,” Long said. “But as I got 
to the second project I was a 
lot more comfortable with it.” 

Long said her instructor, 

Michigan-Mellon 
Design 

Fellow Paulina Reyes, was 
open with students, easy to 
engage with and made the 
learning process easier for 
students.

“She’s always open-minded 

and gives me critiques on my 
work,” she said. “Which to 
me means she wants the best 
from me.”

In a speech during the 

ceremony, 
Long 
said 
she 

enjoyed the experience and 
was grateful to have had the 
chance to participate. She 
added that her perception 

of architecture has changed 
significantly since finishing 
the program.

 Following the program, 

the University will also be 
offering a follow-up workshop 
during which applicants will 
be guided through Taubman’s 
application process in an 
effort to increase the number 
of minority students studying 
architecture either at the 
University or at other schools.

 
That 
additional 
step, 

Curry said, was also an 
important part of increasing 
representation in the field.

“The way that you become 

an architect is to go to 
architecture school,” Curry 
said. “What we’re doing is 
facilitating a demystification 
of the process of applying to 
college, getting admitted to 
college and then paying for 
college.”

Gov. Snyder to 
create new Flint 
water committee 
in executive 
order

Gov. Rick Snyder signed 

an executive order Monday 
to create a new committee 
to work on finding solutions 
to the Flint water crisis as it 
relates to the health of the 
residents.

This follows Snyder 

declaring a state of emergency 
in Flint on Jan. 5. The 
water supply there has been 
contaminated with lead since 
the city switched from Detroit 
city water to the Flint River in 
2014. 

Residents have raised 

concerns over health damage, 
in particular the polluted 
water’s effects on young 
children, and the future safety 
of the city’s water for years to 
come.

The committee is the second 

created by Snyder, who created 
the Flint Water Advisory Task 
Force in October. 

The committee will look at 

the long-run effects of the high 
levels of lead on the health 
of Flint residents and will 
reccommend actions.

Large storm to 
sweep through 
Michigan Tuesday

A high-impact, high-wind 

snowstorm started coming 
through Michigan Monday 
night and will continue on 
Tuesday.

The storm will bring very 

low temperatures and winds 
reaching 30 mph, which will 
give the snow a powdery 
nature. Experts are concerned 
over the danger of blowing 
snow.

The snow will not be 

excessively heavy by Michigan 
winter standards, but the 
lightweight nature of the 
snow may cause near whiteout 
conditions. 

The Ann Arbor area should 

not expect more than two to 
four inches of snow by the time 
to storm concludes on Tuesday. 
Farther north, more snow can 
be expected, with the Traverse 
City area expecting upwards 
of 10 inches and the Upper 
Peninsula receiving more than 
a foot.

City names 
contest winner 
to redesign Ann 
Arbor water 
tower

The City of Ann Arbor has 

selected Bill Burgard as the 
winner of the “Art in the Sky” 
mural project, a city wide 
competition among residents to 
design a mural for Manchester 
elevated Water Tank, 
according to a press release. 

Burgard, a University 

graduate turned lecturer at 
the Stamps School of Art and 
Design, was chosen winner 
for the competition among 598 
of local applicants to for his 
submission. His entry depicted 
birds, fish and other wildlife 
swimming in a river. 

The competition first began 

in fall, with voting for 5 finalist 
entries — which were selected 
by a panel of judges comprised 
of Ann Arbor residents — 
lasting from November to 
December 15. According to the 
press release, over 3,200 votes 
were cast in the competition. 

Renovations to the water 

tank which is located at the 
corner of Washtenaw Ave. and 
Stadium Blvd. are projected to 
be completed by October 2016.

like India.

“I’ve 
heard 
really 
good 

things about Bollywood films,” 
she said. “I have only seen one 
or two, but they are really fun. 
I think one of the great things 
about Netflix is that you can 
find really obscure films as 
opposed to really mainstream 
American culture.”

For countries the company 

is entering such as India, Herl 
said thinks the expansion will 
be a good opportunity.

“They have such a thriving 

movie industry over there, but 
it doesn’t always make it over 
to 
American 
film 
audiences, 

and I think that is something 
Americans are going to enjoy,” 
she said. 

Manchanda noted, however, 

that it will be a challenge for 
Netflix to adapt and produce 
local content geared towards a 
global audience. 

“They will have to change 

and start building and start 
programing original content,” 
Manchanda 
said. 
“Which 

means 
different 
languages, 

different 
cultures, 
different 

kind of movies or shows. And 
I think that is part of their 
strategy.”

Of the 130 countries Netflix 

is expanding into, the company 
has 
not 
entered 
China, 
a 

decision 
Machanda 
said 
is 

political.

“Unless 
the 
Chinese 

government 
is 
comfortable 

with 
the 
ideals 
of 
less 

centralized streaming content, 
it will be hard for Netflix,” 
Manchanda said.

A

sk any Michigan student 
what their most visited 
website 

is during finals 
week and you’ll 
be sure to hear 
one 
answer: 

ctools.umich.edu. It is the site for 
late-night cramming, last-minute 
panicking and hopeful (or hopeless, 
depending on the class) dreaming. 
It is also the site that induces 
expletive-filled rants about missing 
grades and randomly organized 
PDFs. For the longest time, CTools 
has been the go-to source for my 
academic frustrations.

But this past fall, students at 

Michigan 
were 
introduced 
to 

CTools’ replacement, Canvas, and 
soon we will use this new website 
for all of our schoolwork.

With Canvas comes a new hope for 

students and teachers alike. Where 
CTools often seemed like a dated 
side project that still ran on dial-up 
Internet, Canvas is supposed to be 
a modern, efficient and constantly 
improving educational resource.

Rather than being locally stored 

on the University’s servers (like 
CTools of yore), Canvas runs off 
cloud-based computing systems that 
are managed by a group of universi-
ties, collectively called Unizin. This 
decreases the risk of server over-
load and hardware failure that has 
occurred within the CTools frame-
work in the past.

Other features detailed by the 

University’s 
Canvas 
transition 

guide include peer grading, learn-
ing 
outcome 
mapping, 
online 

rubrics, learning analytics, stream-
lined instructional workflows and 
a speed-grader system. All of these 
improvements 
will 
undoubtedly 

lead to a better user experience for 
both students and teachers.

But, ask me about Canvas next 

year during finals week and you’ll 
surely hear CTools-esque rants.

Despite Canvas’ fresh new look 

and exciting new features, nothing 

about the new site addresses the big-
gest problem we all had with CTools 
in the first place: the people actually 
using it.

Thousands of professors and GSIs 

maintain the everyday workings 
of systems like Canvas and CTools. 
Because every class is different, 
every Canvas page is, understand-
ably, very different; an EECS profes-
sor will likely use their Canvas page 
differently than a linguistics GSI.

While flexibility is good for adapt-

ing to course needs, the openness 
of Canvas often leaves everybody 
involved searching for answers.

One primary problem area that 

Canvas didn’t solve is professor 
resources, such as PDF assignment 
documents, syllabi and announce-
ments. Many professors place their 
class resources under the “Files” tab 
and organize subcategories within 
this location. However, syllabi, along 
with assignment documents, often 
make their way into this tab, despite 
each having their own respective 
Canvas tabs.

Even more confusing are assign-

ment documents that are attached 
solely 
to 
class 
announcements. 

Professors have the ability to send 
announcements to their entire class 
instantly, which encourages many 
professors to use these announce-
ments 
as 
assignment-updating 

mechanisms. But in doing so, assign-
ments and other attached resources 
are stored separately from other 
class materials.

When you factor in an average of 

four classes and one discussion sec-
tion for every student each semester, 
you are left with a jumbled mess of 
PDFs, Word documents, folders, 
subfolders and headaches. Related 
complaints focus on instructors 
failing to update grades routinely, 
underutilizing discussion sections 
and leaving large portions of Canvas 
completely untouched (my room-
mates can attest to my shouting and 
frustration the night before I have a 
midterm).

All of these issues point to the 

ways in which users are interacting 
with the site. Users are ultimately 
responsible for how Canvas looks 
and feels. Nothing about Canvas 
caters to users and mitigates the 
issues CTools had.

Information Prof. Barry Fishman 

spoke with the Daily about the intro-
duction of Canvas this past March. 
Despite his general approval of Can-
vas, he concluded his thoughts by say-
ing, “(Learning management systems 
are) the plumbing. Good teachers are 
doing the normally good things that 
they’re doing around here. Particu-
larly exciting teachers, I have seen no 
way in which Canvas is holding them 
back. It’s not about Canvas, it’s about 
what you do with it.”

Until we address the manner in 

which we collectively use learning 
management systems like Canvas, 
nothing will change. Educating pro-
fessors on best practices and general 
management skills is a good first 
step to fixing the issues at hand. 
Teaching students how to effective-
ly traverse Canvas is a coinciding 
step that would also likely improve 
the educational process.

Both of these processes take time, 

though, and cannot be fixed with 
a software update. Professors are 
understandably very busy, as are 
college students. Making the effort 
to collectively address users’ issues 
with employing a new system is nei-
ther a simple solution nor one that 
many would identify as the Univer-
sity’s top priority. It is, however, the 
necessary solution to a problem that 
deeply affects students and faculty 
alike.

Canvas is not holding us back — 

if anything, it is a step in the right 
direction. But if the only step we 
take is making Canvas the new stan-
dard platform without any sort of 
user prep, you will surely hear the 
same expletive-filled rants from me 
this time next year.

I just won’t be able to blame 

CTools anymore.

Don’t blame CTools

A nation without charity

I

f I were to ask you what you 
think 
about 
charity, 
you’d 

probably 
respond 
with 

something 
positive. 
Charity 
work 

aids 
important 

sectors of society 
including health 
care, 
education 

and the economy. 
It 
stimulates 

communities, 
promotes human 
development and 
remains 
within 

the 
private 

sector, where it can be “purely” 
devoted to the cause.

And you’d probably rejoice in 

learning that donations to char-
ity organizations from individuals 
increased by 7.1 percent from 2013 
to 2014. You’ll maybe even fist-pump 
the sky when you hear that chari-
ties received more than $358 billion 
during the same year — the fifth con-
secutive year giving to charity orga-
nizations has increased in America.

With this framework, it appears 

that the generous American public 
has found its panacea for human suf-
fering. As charities grow, it won’t be 
long before stories of homelessness, 
truancy and inequality wither; the 
economy will continue to expand 
and people will give more until no 
one else is in need. Issues like pover-
ty will eventually appear antiquated 
and somewhat abstract, something 
we only read about in textbooks and 
share with our kids when telling sto-
ries of the days when we were young.

But unfortunately, for all the dif-

ference charities make in the social, 
economic and communal develop-
ment of our nation, they don’t seem 
to alleviate life for the poor: In 
2014, poverty remained unchanged, 
affecting 14.9 percent, or 47 million 
Americans.

For all the energy charities 

devote to revitalizing communities, 
I wonder: Why does charity exist 
at all? And, for that matter, why is 
it the responsibility of charities to 
solve our nation’s ills, and further, 
why should these problems even 
exist in the first place?

Charity’s 
operative 
goals, 
it 

seems, are reactive. That is, its 
function is a response to current 
or future misery experienced by 

many citizens. Billions of dollars 
are poured into these organizations 
to combat future trends of poverty, 
violence, drug addiction, hunger and 
illiteracy, or to gain access to health 
care benefits. They are rehabilitative 
efforts to our system. But if that’s all 
they are — inherently reactive mea-
sures — why not just change the sys-
tem itself?

In order to do this, we should be 

investing in proactive public insti-
tutions as to prevent people from 
(what we hope are) non-normative 
behaviors: 
drug 
abuse, 
under-

ground economic activity and vio-
lent crime — things that cause them 
to be rejected by society. We should 
be bringing people into mainstream 
institutions — providing pathways 
to health care, education, jobs and 
social inclusion — thereby closing 
gaping holes in America’s system.

Excuse my Marxism, but episodes 

of human suffering persist because 
poverty is systemic: It’s based on how 
we redistribute wealth (or don’t). 
Thankfully, our economy is expan-
sive: We manufacture enough prod-
ucts and create enough services to 
ensure that no one has to be homeless 
or go hungry. With an economy GDP 
of about $17 trillion, we can trim our 
incredibly high poverty rate, which is 
15 percent. To put this in perspective, 
China’s economy is worth approxi-
mately $10 trillion, but they main-
tain a 13-percent poverty rate, even 
though they care for about 1 billion 
more people. Like putting a bandage 
on a gunshot wound, charity is not a 
comprehensive approach and there-
fore cannot resolve the issues it may 
seek to.

A more comprehensive alternative 

is some form of redistributed wealth. 
This means viewing our world as 
interconnected, not individualistic — 
something the American public has 
a hard time accepting, its ideal self 
being the archetypical John Wayne 
character, riding across the prairie 
on horseback, fulfilling his manifest 
destiny.

Maybe government has a respon-

sibility aside from just landing on 
the moon, fighting wars halfway 
across the world and allowing peo-
ple to roam the wild wild west. The 
role of our government includes 
uniting society — integrating those 
of different classes, races, creeds 
and backgrounds — to improve the 

economy, health and general well-
being of citizens. This philosophy 
means our government and the elec-
torate are responsible for each oth-
er’s successes and failures.

To be sure, our country can have 

its cake and eat it, too, promoting 
economic liberalization — privatiz-
ing and (at times) deregulating — 
while upholding human dignity by 
reallocating some of that capital to 
others as an opportunity for many 
to enter mainstream society. Other 
nations with much less wealth cer-
tainly do this. This has been the 
policy of countries from Norway and 
Canada to Singapore. They invest 
in their citizens because they know 
the results are advantageous. It’s no 
wonder they’re more often included 
in “best countries to live in” lists.

For those capitalist-minded, Mil-

ton Friedman-types, one possible 
solution can come in the form of a 
guaranteed basic income. In this sce-
nario, certain subsidies can be cut, or 
wealthy banks and oil companies can 
be taxed more heavily in order to pro-
vide a basic income for low-socioeco-
nomic-status families. If more people 
have a basic income, they may be able 
to spend more, which stimulates the 
economy.

Who knows? Maybe our country 

is moving in this direction. One Ver-
mont democratic socialist senator 
has gained much popularity because 
of his government-interventionist 
beliefs. Presidential hopeful Bernie 
Sanders wants to expand health care 
coverage, make higher-level educa-
tion affordable and provide family 
paid leave — all to invest in human 
capital and contract inequality.

He’s adopting a new American 

mentality. A mentality that holds 
the state accountable so that more of 
its citizens — no matter their creed, 
sex, race, socioeconomic status or 
ethnicity — have the opportunity to 
live with dignity and maintain a rea-
sonable standard of living in the 21st 
century. By adopting this thinking, 
Sanders knows he must first reform 
the “rigged” financial system.

Until more Americans follow his 

leading mantra, charity is the best 
thing we have in a broken, unbal-
anced system.

Schlissel’s Diversity, Equity & 
Inclusion 
strategic 
planning 

initiative is admirable, its prospects for 
success are questionable. The President’s 
charge calls on each campus unit to develop a 
five-year strategic plan to promote diversity, 
equity and inclusion. We are excited to see 
this new momentum in the wake of the 
#BBUM campaign, and to see this effort 
come from top University leadership. The 
current dialogue is absolutely necessary 
for us to continue to foster awareness of 
historical and ongoing institutional biases at 
the University, and to move beyond a purely 
academic 
understanding 
of 
structural 

racism. Unfortunately, the initiative falls 
short in a profoundly important way.

To date, there has been no explicit alloca-

tion of resources to make diversity happen at 
the University. Other educational institutions 
have recently funded large-scale diversity pro-
grams: Brown University announced plans to 
spend $100 million to promote diversity on its 
campus, and Yale University launched a $50 
million initiative to increase faculty diver-
sity. These financial pledges are a testament 
to their commitment to social equity. We are 
waiting to see whether efforts at the Univer-
sity will be supported by funds commensurate 
with their degree of importance.

Funding for the President’s charge remains 

ambiguous, even as two mechanisms for diver-
sity funding opportunities have been described 
in disseminated documents. First, departments 
are encouraged to submit “requests for funding 
for innovative initiatives … through the annu-
al budget process,” according to a frequently 
asked questions document distributed to cam-
pus groups in November. However, there is 
little transparency surrounding how much will 
be made available within the annual budget, 
or how competitive it will be to secure these 
funds. Secondly, the campus-wide initiative 
is being overseen by an executive leadership 
team that “will allocate resources throughout 
the planning process and ensure that the effort 
is appropriately supported and staffed.” Again, 
the level of support and direct provision of tan-
gible funds remains vague. In order to address 
climate and bias issues effectively, allocated 
budgetary line items are needed to develop, 
implement and sustain strategic plans.

Without dedicated funding, there are three 

major vulnerabilities in the President’s Stra-
tegic Planning Initiative that put diversity, 
equity,and inclusion efforts at risk for failure:

1) The task of “doing” diversity has been 

assigned to individuals with limited or no 
expertise on the topic, and who may not share 
our sense of urgency. In theory, there are 92 
individuals serving as “Strategic Planning 
Leads” across campus, but in practice depart-
ment chairs, deans and other administrators 
have been granted a great deal of discretion 
over what types of diversity activities will take 
place, and the amount of resources dedicated 
towards them. The initiative expects school 
units to “allocate funds within their (own) bud-
gets for plan-related activities” according to 
the FAQ; however, this approach assumes that 
chairs and leaders of those units are willing to 
commit sufficient funds to support this work, 
and sacrifice precious resources (including 
staff time) that would otherwise go towards 
existing programming. Furthermore, the ini-
tiative depends heavily on administrators’ per-
ceptions of what can and should be done. These 
assumptions are cause for concern.

To put things plainly, many of the individ-

uals being called upon to develop and imple-
ment strategic plans have directly benefited 
from systems of oppression within academic 
spaces. These individuals were never criti-
cally evaluated on their understanding of 
race and inequality before assuming their 
roles, let alone their ability to address climate 
issues in their respective units. Consider-
ing that we have dealt with years of delays, 
inaction and at best superficial engagement 
with initiatives to address race and climate 
at the University, why should we believe that 
administrators are both knowledgeable about 
and committed to social equity? The Michi-
gan Mandate of the early 1990s, a University 
initiative to recruit and retain faculty of color, 
failed to do so. Like the current initiative, the 
mandate was largely unfunded and used a 
decentralized approach that gave high-rank-
ing administrators within each department 
much discretionary power. History must not 
repeat itself. A dedicated funding pipeline for 
the President’s Initiative would equip admin-
istrators with support and much needed 
expertise from trained professionals.

2) The development of strategic plans 

requires a high level of engagement from cam-
pus units that may lack the capacity to imple-
ment them. Time is just as important a resource 
as money, and anyone at the University can 

speak to its scarcity. No new staff are being hired 
to support diversity initiatives within school 
units. Instead, the day-to-day tasks required for 
planning and implementing diversity initiatives 
are being added to the duties of existing faculty 
and staff. Changing the climate at the University 
is a shared responsibility and all members of the 
community should indeed contribute. But the 
reality is that when diversity responsibilities are 
tacked on to existing job descriptions, they are 
not given the time and attention they deserve. So 
long as faculty and staff are burdened with new 
job responsibilities but no additional resources 
to meet their requirements, diversity and inclu-
sion plans are bound to fall short of expectations. 
Departments need resources to increase their 
faculty and staff capacity to take on diversity ini-
tiatives and engage with them meaningfully.

There are many centers at the University 

that could partner with departments to fur-
ther the goals of the President’s initiative. 
Centers such as the Office for Institutional 
Equity and Services for Students with Dis-
abilities, among others, are equipped with 
trained staff who are knowledgeable about 
equity issues. Nevertheless, these centers 
cannot be expected to adequately support 
school units with strategic planning on such 
a large scale. Allocated resources for diversity 
and inclusion could increase the capacity of 
existing centers on campus to connect with 
school units and provide them with expertise 
and practical guidance.

3) Strategic planning activities are devoid 

of incentives and continue to rely on the uncom-
pensated labor of minority faculty, students and 
staff. When responsibility for diversity efforts is 
spread across the entire community, it becomes 
very easy for those with the least to gain from 
them to remain complacent, and allow others 
to carry the burden. Rhetoric surrounding the 
initiative emphasizes shared responsibility, but 
does not acknowledge the reality that behavior 
change rarely occurs in the absence of concrete 
incentives. As long as engagement with stra-
tegic planning activities continues to be vol-
unteer-based, the volunteers themselves will 
suffer for it. University leaders must recognize 
that those who generously provide their exper-
tise and unpaid labor to leaders and admin-
istrators pay a price for it, both professionally 
and psychologically. Faculty, staff and students 
of color are routinely called upon to educate 
and train their respective units on topics of 
equity and power at their own expense, while 
their more privileged counterparts are able to 
invest their energies into activities that reward 
them professionally. In this way, counter to its 
intentions, the Strategic Planning Initiative’s 
over-reliance on the voluntary contributions 
of faculty, students and staff of color actually 
exacerbates disparities at the University.

Contributors to diversity efforts must be 

compensated and rewarded with opportuni-
ties for professional advancement. Staff and 
students who do this work should be paid 
to do it. Service contributions that address 
issues of equity and climate should be weight-
ed accordingly when faculty are being evalu-
ated for tenure.

Equally as important, there must be strong 

disincentives to discourage complacency and 
penalties imposed upon negative contribu-
tors to climate. If diversity is indeed a shared 
responsibility, then entire departments should 
face ramifications when discrimination occurs 
on their watch. As long as the current charge 
remains volunteer driven, and no consequenc-
es are imposed on poor performers, the ini-
tiative will be ineffective. Simply asking the 
community to care about diversity, without 
providing them with incentives to do so, will 
fail to transform the campus climate.

The President’s initiative has succeeded 

in increasing dialogue related to diversity 
and equity at the University. However, these 
campus discussions have been ongoing for 
decades; our communities are fatigued by 
“diversity talk” and have little hope for 
change at the University. We question how 
the contemporary rhetoric differs from that 
of the past, particularly when the current 
initiative is unfunded. Without an infusion 
of resources to 1) build expertise, 2) increase 
capacity and 3) compensate and incentivize 
engagement, diversity efforts will continue 
to fall to the bottom of departments’ lists of 
competing priorities. Funding is far more 
critical than dialogue, and its presence or 
absence will dictate whether we succeed or 
fail as a community. We want to see Univer-
sity leadership rise to the occasion and earn 
the trust of minority students, faculty and 
staff by giving diversity its own budget.

‘Downton Abbey’ is 
back for a final jaunt

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

The roaring twenties are stir-

ring up a storm, and things are 
“positively frugal” at the Down-
ton 
Abbey. 

With only two 
handmaidens 
and 
a 
single 

hall boy left, 
how will the 
lords and ladies 
manage to go 
on? It’s 1925, 
and those who 
can’t keep up 
are left behind. 
So, let the flap-
per dresses and 
jazz music run wild — Downton 
is entering the new age. Wom-
en’s rights, secret daughters, 
marriages and threats of bank-
ruptcy are all on the horizon in 
the Masterpiece Classic’s final 
season, along with the usual 
dose of snobbery and back-
handed sass, of course. In true 
“Downton Abbey” fashion, the 
lords and ladies eagerly trample 
into their backyard expanse for 
a weekend hunt as the final sea-
son springs to life, promising to 
tie up loose ends without unrav-
eling too many new threads.

After winning three Gold-

en Globes and 12 Primetime 
Emmys, the British period dra-
ma’s sixth season premiere lives 
up to the expectations set by 
its resounding critical acclaim. 
Consistently showcasing epi-
sodes of breathtaking cinema-
tography and precise dialogue, 
“Downton Abbey” proves, once 
again, to be anything but a pas-
sive viewing experience. Much 
of the series’ merit lies in the 
nuances: the witty remarks, 
oftentimes delivered by the bril-
liant Maggie Smith (“Harry Pot-
ter”) as Countess Violet Crawley, 
and the exchange of snooty 
looks color even the smallest 
moments. Perhaps this attention 
to detail is what drew audiences 
to the series in the first place. 
“Downton Abbey” has proven 
to be more than a historical 

analysis of the highbrow upper 
class 
elite 
juxtaposed 
with 

the slim pickings lives of their 
working-class 
staff. 
Instead, 

the show highlights the surpris-
ing relativity of human nature, 
even within seemingly opposite 
groups of people.

Other than showing some 

ankle and sporting dramatic 
hairdos (winning the series 
three Primetime Emmy awards 
for outstanding hairstyles), the 
women of Downton continue to 
challenge the boundaries of the 
status quo. The opening hunt-
ing scene shows Lady Mary 
(Michelle Dockery, “Non-Stop”) 
straddling her horse rather than 
riding side-saddle, which, as 
Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonn-
eville, “Iris”) points out, is “so 
much more graceful.” Mean-
while, Lady Edith (Laura Car-
michael, “Burn Burn Burn”) 
toils with her editor, whose male 
ego cannot handle working for 
a woman. In tune with previ-
ous seasons, Lady Mary and her 
sisters (past and present) bring 
the “modern” into a house des-
perately holding on to the tra-
ditional past, and the familiar 
themes of progress and inevita-
ble change ring through.

Going back to the basics, 

“Downton Abbey” starts its 
sixth season with what it does 
best: blackmail with the intent 
of social destruction. The secret 
fling between Lady Mary and 
Tony Gillingham (Tom Cullen, 
“Weekend”) was brought back 
from the dead when a gold-dig-
ging employee of their getaway 
hotel comes to haunt the Abbey’s 
reputation. The scandal is put 
to rest (for now), but the most 
significant takeaway from the 
interaction is Mary’s intent to 
stay single — until the right man 
comes along, anyway. Her grow-
ing self-sufficiency has allowed 
the focus of Mary’s character 
to switch from juggling her 
budding love life to honing her 
shrewd business savvy, and 
exploring the idea that a woman 
in the 1920s is not defined by the 
husband at her side. Mary’s rela-

tionship status could take a vari-
ety of directions by the series’ 
end, a creative decision that will 
make a significant statement to 
the progression of women into a 
new era.

Romances are heating up 

downstairs too, as Mr. Carson 
(Jim Carter, “The Golden Com-
pass”) and Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis 
Logan, “Secrets and Lies”) take 
the next step before officially 
tying the knot. As the Abbey’s 
relationships go, there have 
been matches both political 
and passionate, and everything 
in between. Yet, Mr. Carson 
and Mrs. Hughes’ love is one 
rarely depicted on screen, and 
it’s executed fantastically on 
“Downton Abbey.” The two 
middle-aged singles have devot-
ed their life to work, and have 
grown to love each other years 
after the conventional time-
frame of typical newlyweds. 
Mrs. 
Hughes’ 
reservations 

before setting the date of the 
wedding, however, are of the 
unspeakable nature: she is wor-
ried about Mr. Carson’s sexual 
expectations. Both comical and 
surprisingly relatable, the story 
arc brings out an innocence and 
vulnerability within the char-
acters and serves as a gentle 
reminder that love is never too 
late. Although their relation-
ship is not bold or passionate, 
the nuances in their friendly 
exchanges hold more weight 
than a grand, romantic gesture. 
After all, hearing Mr. Carson 
say he is tickled when she walks 
into a room is infinitely more 
satisfying than an over-the-top 
declaration of eternal love.

Half a world and nearly a cen-

tury away from the modern day 
America, the Abbey’s dramas 
and scandals have found a place 
within the emotions of its audi-
ence. In a season premiere that 
showcases unforgettable visu-
als and the emotional versatility 
of the cast, “Downton Abbey” 
sets up high expectations to do 
the beloved characters justice 
as their stories, after five years, 
come to a close.

TV REVIEW
‘Man Seeking’ great, 
hilarious television

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Senior Arts Editor

It’s good to have “Man Seek-

ing Woman” back.

In its second season premiere, 

“Wings,” 
“Man 
Seek-

ing 
Woman” 

repeats 
the 

winning 
for-

mula 
that 

made its first 
season 
such 

an unexpect-
ed 
delight. 

As in the first 
season, 
Josh 

Greenberg 
(Jay Baruchel, 
“This is the 
End”) 
navi-

gates a surrealist dating world 
with his best friend, Mike (Eric 
André, “The Eric Andre Show”), 
and sister, Liz (Britt Lower, 
“Unforgettable”), at his side. 
With the help of self-referen-
tially deployed TV and movie 
tropes, the show uses absurdist 
fantastical elements to tell relat-
able stories about millennial 
dating (last season, for example, 
featured Josh attending a wed-
ding in literal Hell to emphasize 
the perils of going to weddings 
while single).

The episode begins with an 

excellent introduction, as Mike 
is visited by a pair of weary sol-
diers coming to deliver some 

tragic news: Josh has a girl-
friend, and as a result he won’t 
be spending much time with his 
best friend anymore. The scene 
uses the popular trope of the sad 
arrival of troops to break the 
news to the family of a deceased 
soldier, likening the impending 
death of a friendship to an actu-
al, physical death. It’s all there 
in one hilarious line: “Doctors 
say he may never hang again.”

Because of “Man Seeking 

Woman” ’s tendency to structure 
its episodes in roughly three 
segments, some episodes can 
feel disjointed. So while there’s 
a strong narrative through line 
with Josh and Mike’s friend-
ship in jeopardy, it still feels 
oddly structured. Mike is the 
main focus in the first act as he 
struggles to keep his friendship 
intact, but the second act pivots 
to tell the story of Josh and his 
girlfriend Kelly (Sarah Gadon, 
“Maps to the Stars”) going on 
a trip to a cabin with Kelly’s 
high school friends. Then the 
third act pivots again, as Josh 
and Kelly break up and Josh 
returns home to find that Mike 
improbably has a college-age 
child (Maya Lowe, “Killjoys”), 
apparently created when Josh 
and Mike “accidentally jizzed 
into the same toilet and then 
it got struck by lightning.” In 
this final sequence, Josh tries 
to bond with his daughter, ref-
erencing the common story 

of a father desperately trying 
to connect with the family he 
abandoned.

Despite the slight awkward 

feeling that the shifting plots 
create, all three of the stories 
are strong. The first one espe-
cially is excellent because Josh 
is almost always the sole view-
point we get to see, with Mike 
relegated to the over-the-top 
funny best friend role. The sec-
ond act uses a parody of slasher 
films like “I Know What You 
Did Last Summer” to show what 
it’s like trying to fit in with your 
partner’s friends, who all have 
their own inside jokes and a 
shared history you’ll never be 
a part of (in this case, an acci-
dental murder that resulted in a 
lumberjack being brought back 
from the dead to get revenge). 
And the closing segment ends 
cleverly, with Josh and Mike 
sending their daughter off to 
college, musing on how it seems 
like just yesterday that she 
came into their lives.

Still, by far the strongest 

material is when “Wings” focus-
es on the dynamic between Josh 
and Mike and the core idea of 
the episode: it’s hard to date and 
still maintain your friendships. 
It’s a relatable struggle that mil-
lennial daters understand, and 
seeing it presented in such a fan-
tastical context makes it both 
hilarious in its absurdity, and yet 
all the more real.

LITERATURE COLUMN

The growing debate 

over genres

“

I am on the side of the pix-
ies and the dragons,” said 
author Kazuo Ishiguro, 

defending his approach to the 
fantasy genre in his 2015 novel, 
“The Bur-
ied Giant.” 
Ishiguro’s 
statement 
came in 
response 
to stones 
thrown by 
science fic-
tion novelist 
Ursula K. Le 
Guin, who 
criticized Ishiguro’s use of the 
“surface elements” of a literary 
genre. Welcome to the genre 
debate, the conversation about 
the shift in reading and writing 
that currently dominates liter-
ary discussion.

As I began to dive deeper 

into contemporary fiction and 
the corresponding discourse 
about it, many questions arose 
in my mind. How did these 
rigid rules of genre form — was 
this categorization out of con-
venience or pure snobbery? Are 
genre books and traditionally 
serious “literary” books, books 
that hold merit through social 
commentary or the explora-
tion of the human condition, 
mutually exclusive? When did 
it become acceptable to use the 
word “genre” as an adjective?

Genre may have begun as 

a matter of convenience, but 
in the last century of Ameri-
can literature, a clear divide 
emerged between genre novels 
and literary novels. This bisec-
tion rested on the American 
public obsession with realism, 
a fascination not mirrored in 
other countries. To this day, 
award-winning novels tend to 
focus on the minutiae of real-
istic life. Novels like Jeffrey 
Eugenides’s “Middlesex” and 
Jane Smiley’s “A Thousand 
Acres” win Pulitzers while 
other writers whose novels 
consider the strange and the 
uncanny are overlooked.

But after years of genre nov-

els beginning to incorporate 
the characteristics that earn 
literary novels prestige, the 
boundaries between “literary” 
and “genre” are beginning 
to dwindle. A genre novel, 
“Swamplandia!,” was a runner-

up for the Pulitzer for Fiction 
in 2012, the year no one won 
the prestigious prize. With its 
transcendent writing about 
a family running an alligator 
wrestling amusement park in 
Florida, the unusual “Swamp-
landia!” presumably would 
have won if not for its uncanny 
subject and the fact that the 
author, Karen Russell, was 
extraordinarily young when 
she wrote the novel.

More and more established 

authors are conflating the sta-
tus of literary with the escap-
ism of genre. When Colson 
Whitehead, esteemed novelist 
and winner of the McArthur 
Fellowship, penned a zombie 
novel, it was surprising. How-
ever, as Whitehead said in an 
interview with NPR, “I did 
have to give myself permission 
because zombies were so popu-
lar. But I think the idea is that 
if it’s good, people read it. So 
all I could do is really salute my 
childhood influences and try to 
do the best I could in reinvigo-
rating the genre, putting a new 
spin on it.”

With genre becoming a part 

of mainstream “serious” lit-
erature, there is an increase in 
capitalization of these beloved 
methods of literary escapism. 
Stores like the exclusively mys-
tery book-driven Aunt Agatha’s 
in downtown Ann Arbor thrive 
because of their audience’s 
devotion to the mystery genre.

I talked to Jamie Agnew, 

the co-owner of Aunt Agatha’s, 
about how this fusion of liter-
ary and genre is affecting the 
24-year-old store. He cites a 
growing interest in mystery 
and the loyalty of the mystery 
reader as the backbone of the 
store’s continued success. But 
Agnew doubts there’s going to 
be much synthesis between the 
literary world and his genre of 

choice: mystery.

“I know that many people, 

especially in a place like Ann 
Arbor, think that slogging 
through a painfully serious and 
literary book is somehow more 
virtuous than reading a book 
that is entertaining, but to me 
that’s a fairly recent attitude,” 
Agnew said. “The great novels 
of the 19th century are both 
profound and enjoyable to read, 
and quite a few of them had to 
do with the themes of modern 
mystery such as identity, guilt 
and murder. If ‘Crime and Pun-
ishment’ came out today, what 
section of the bookstore would 
it be shelved? I’ll add that I 
think literary fiction is a genre 
like any other, with just as many 
artificialities and strictures.”

Agnew sees mystery, which 

has an incredibly different 
history from other genres like 
romance or science fiction, as 
growing to greater significance 
since its conception.

“The movement I have 

seen the most is from static 
protagonists — like Poirot or 
Philip Marlowe, who change 
little over the course of many 
series books — to more nuanced 
figures like Steve Hamilton’s 
Alex McKnight or William Kent 
Krueger’s Cork O’Connor who, 
over the course of succeeding 
installments achieve a depth of 
characterization impossible in 
any single novel,” Agnew said. 
“Lately, it has been the vogue 
for ‘literary’ writers to attempt 
thrillers, presumably seeking 
the vitality and popularity lack-
ing in their own genre, but not 
all of them have the skills to 
pull it off.”

As the lines between liter-

ary and genre continue to blur 
in this way, we’ll inevitably see 
some failures and some daz-
zling successes. Genre conven-
tions will always exist, there’s 
no arguing that — but maybe 
in the next few years, some of 
our favorite books will be ones 
featuring more unconventional 
protagonists. When the genre 
war is over, Ishiguro will be 
proven right — the victors will 
inevitably include the pixies 
and the dragons.

I’d be bullshitting you if I 

tried to say anything too neat 
and tidy like “ ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Suicide’ saved my life.” I knew 
that Bowie didn’t really know 
what I was going through. He 
made great music, but he wasn’t 
“speaking to me” or showing me 
how I needed to live. But in his 
music and in my weird way of 
thinking, he gave me the tools I 
needed to be courageous when 
I didn’t know how, and he let 
me be comfortable with myself 
when I was in a full–on panic 
about who I was.

I have a really hard time 

being open and honest about 
my feelings. I still — and I don’t 
even know why I do this — I 
still avoid identifying myself as 
gay unless I’m really comfort-
able with whomever I’m with. 

I take my anxieties and my pri-
vate fears and project them onto 
art that I love and then I try to 
talk about that art with people. 
I nervously ramble about the 
show “Community” when I’m 
worried about loneliness or I 
put on a Van Morrison record 
and over-explain all the tracks 
when I really want to say “I love 
you” and mean it. But David 
Bowie helped me with a dif-
ferent kind of emotional hon-
esty. I never really connected 
with anyone else over Bowie or 
had any kind of multi-layered, 
meaningful conversations about 
his work. Instead, he was an 
artist who helped me so much 
at just communicating with 
myself. Instead of just saying 
“I’m gay,” I could tell myself “I 
want to be like David Bowie,” 
and that made all of my feelings 
so much better. Because David 
Bowie is fucking amazing and 
had one of the greatest careers 
ever and just made the most 

beautiful music that of course I 
would love him and everything 
he meant.

Bowie has so many amazing 

achievements that I’m sure will 
be counted up and summarized 
by millions over the next few 
days, years, generations. But for 
me personally, he’s always going 
to be kind of this mentor figure. 
He wasn’t a substitute for the 
friends who helped me in a very 
tangible, important way and to 
whom I’m forever in debt to. But 
during an incredibly tumultuous 
year, a rock star from Mars made 
a gay, Midwestern high school 
freshman feel unique instead 
of freakish, proud instead of 
despairing. He’s a huge part of 
why music means so much to me, 
and every time I see an artist be 
really honest about who they are 
in a public forum, I’m so happy. 
Because I think of me and David 
Bowie and I know that a con-
fused kid has just found a new 
light in his life.

‘Blackstar’ proves 
Bowie’s immortality

By SELENA AGUILERA

Daily Arts Writer

I wrote this review a few 

days prior to the recent news 
of David Bowie’s death. I’m not 
really chang-
ing it, but I’m 
adding 
some 

feelings about 
Bowie 
right 

here. 
David 

Bowie is the 
definition 
of 

iconic. He is 
the 
end-all 

be-all living breathing state-
ment of “just be yourself.” He’s 
been a major influence in my 

life as well as the lives of others, 
from ages 13 to 73. Age doesn’t 
matter in the love of Bowie. I 
give condolences to anyone who 
knew Bowie because I’m dis-
traught, and I was only given 
the pleasure to listen to his 
music. Knowing him person-
ally would have been too bit-
tersweet for me to handle. I 
want to say thank you, David 
Bowie, for releasing one more 
piece of yourself into the world 
before you left. Thank you for 
staying humble. Thank you for 
simply being amazing, which is 
honestly an understatement. I 
could go on about my emotions 
towards Bowie, but crying in 
class is weird, so without fur-
ther ado here are some thoughts 
on Blackstar.

January 8 is one of the cool-

est days out of the year. If you 
didn’t know, it’s Elvis Presley’s 
birthday. Let’s have a moment 
of silence to appreciate the King 
of Rock ‘n’ Roll, and another 
for Bowie himself (much love, 
Bowie). OK, the moment of 
silence is over, because guess 
what? It’s David Bowie’s birth-
day too. I know, two musical 
geniuses sharing a birthday 
sounds insane, but I’m not lying 
to you. And to make January 
8 even more spectacular, this 
year Bowie decided to release 
his 25th studio album, Black-
star, on that day.

Blackstar was released on 

Bowie’s 
69th 
birthday 
but 

despite his age, he still sings 
like a beautiful angel. His voice 
never lost its charm through 
time; in fact, nothing about 
Bowie has been or will be lost. 
David Bowie is some sort of 
extraterrestrial 
superhuman 

that keeps progressing with 
time, as evidenced by the obvi-
ous undertones of outer space 
injected into his music and 
personality. 
From 
dressing 

like a character on Star Trek 
to releasing songs like “Life 
on Mars,” “Space Oddity” and 
“Blackstar” – the first track on 
the new album – space and for-
eign ideas have always been a 
part of Bowie’s aesthetic.

Just 30 seconds into the first 

song on Blackstar, I was trans-
ported to a completely differ-
ent environment. The drums 
collaborate with the piano, and 
visions of walking in a desert 
fill my head. The song keeps a 
slow and steady pace as Bowie 
labels himself a “blackstar,” 
which is an alternative to a 
black hole. “I’m a blackstar. I’m 
not a pornstar. I’m not a wan-
dering star. I’m a blackstar,” 
he claims. The song continues 
with other eerie chants and 
each instrument starts to close 
out, leaving only the flute and 

R2-D2-esque beeps. It creates 
a celestial experience until 
everything falls silent.

“Tis a Pity She Was a Whore,” 

the next track, escapes the 
spacey feel of “Blackstar,” giv-
ing the old Bowie a chance to 
shine through. The intro of the 
song sounds similar to that of 
“Immigrant Song,” by Led Zep-
pelin, but without the moaning 
voice. The instrumentals are 
in a higher tempo and Bowie 
starts to talk about an aggres-
sive encounter with a woman, 
saying, “Man, she punched 
me like a dude.” It’s harsh and 
weird and sets up the diversity 
of Blackstar early on.

The third song, “Lazarus,” 

catapults you back into the 
space journey. The entire song is 
melancholy, and in the lyrics we 
hear Bowie shedding his hard 
exterior. He weeps, “Every-
body knows me now. Look up 
here man I’m in danger. I’ve 
got nothing left to lose. I’m so 
high it makes my brain whirl,” 
admitting to the harsh effects 
fame has had on his life. Bowie 
makes himself vulnerable and 
allows us to reach a softer 
side of him, showing that even 
someone as wild and eccentric 
as himself can be cuffed by the 
world’s judgments.

Following 
that 
emotional 

jam, “Sue (Or in a Season of 
Crime)” starts off sounding like 
classic rock, but maintains the 
dark and lost feeling through-
out Blackstar. “Girl Loves Me” 
is the follow up song and con-
tains high notes that only Bowie 
could hit at his age, adding 
to the colorful sounds in this 
album.

The last songs “Dollar Days,” 

and “I Can’t Give Everything 
Away” 
didn’t 
do 
anything 

special for me. They’re pleas-
ing to the ears and showcase 
Bowie’s talent, but after being 
mesmerized by the almost ten-
minute-long opener and their 
follow-ups, the final two start 
to lack charisma. The lyrics are 
repetitive, and there’s nothing 
prominent enough to leave an 
impression. They’re not very 
“Bowie” at all.

Aside from the ending, Black-

star is insanely good for being 
a 25th album released by a 
69-year-old man. David Bowie 
is a legend, and his talent will 
never be forgotten. If you know 
anyone who was born on Janu-
ary 8, it’d probably be wise to 
support them, because who 
knows? They could be a great 
musical genius someday. Thank 
you for everything you’ve done, 
David Bowie. You’ll remain one 
of the brightest stars in our sky. 
Life on Mars? There is now.

Caine’s ‘Youth’ 
not very mature

Indie drama filled 
with beauty and 

frustration

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

In “Youth,” two friends, Fred 

and Mick — played respectively 
by Michael Caine (“The Dark 
Knight Rises”) 
and 
Harvey 

Kietel 
(“Taxi 

Driver”) 
— 

vacation 
at 

a 
real 
world 

“Grand 
Buda-

pest Hotel” in 
the Swiss Alps, 
aimlessly mov-
ing between spas, massages and 
conversations about their own 
mortality. 

“Youth” abounds with beauty 

— scenes of dialogue are sepa-
rated by quiet mountain vistas 
and perfectly symmetrical shots 
of people floating in pools and 
lounging in saunas. “Youth” is 
strongest when it is silent, in the 
moments when it doesn’t try to 
be anything more than beautiful.

And perhaps it isn’t anything 

more than beautiful. The two 
lead characters are artists and 
therefore seekers and creators 
of beauty. Mick is a screenwriter 
and Fred is a composer; both 
are struggling with the grav-
ity of final works. Mick solves 
the problem with a thinly veiled 

auto-biopic starring Jane Fonda, 
and Fred chooses retirement. 
One might expect “Youth,” then, 
to be a film about art or at least 
say something profound about 
art. However, the only message 
the film manages to send about 
art is a problematic one. It’s clear 
in “Youth” that the men are art-
ists and the women merely their 
muses. The creators are accom-
panied by women who (like art) 
often exist purely as sexualized 
objects. Miss Universe (new-
comer Madalina Ghenea), one of 
the film’s few female characters, 
seems to be the embodiment 
of this notion. Fresh off being 
crowned the world’s most view-
able woman, she comes to the 
posh Swiss hotel and surprises 
everyone with her ability to 
speak. In this sense, “Youth” is 
like a man who does not recog-
nize his inherent male privilege 
— not malicious, just frustrating.

“Youth” tries to say something 

poignant about aging by placing 
its leads in contrast with young-
er versions of themselves. Fred 
encounters a young violinist play-
ing his most famous work, and 

Mick is accompanied by a team 
of young screenwriters who are 
helping him with his final mas-
terwork. There’s potential for a 
really interesting parallel here, 
but “Youth” fails to develop any of 
its younger characters to the same 
extent as their older counterparts 
(who themselves are quite under-
developed). An interesting rela-
tionship does arise between Fred 
and a young movie star played by 
Paul Dano (“Love & Mercy”) as 
the two find commonality — both 
worry they will only be remem-
bered for their low-quality, high-
popularity work.

Remembrance seems to be the 

idea around which “Youth” is 
centered. Surrounded by quiet, 
actionless scenes (which read very 
much like memories), remem-
brance is at the heart of most of 
the film’s dialogue. Mick and Fred 
discuss their own memories, their 
own forgetfulness, and the world’s 
remembrance of them. Therefore, 
the film’s visuals take precedence 
over the plot, creating the illu-
sion that the film itself follows the 
incomplete and irregular rhythm 
of memory.

Despite the film’s name, I was 

the youngest person in the theater 
by at least 30 years. Maybe that 
means I’m just not in the film’s 
target audience. But perhaps the 
film doesn’t have a target audi-
ence, and is instead stuck floating 
between nostalgia and foreshad-
owing. Ultimately, “Youth” is a 
beautiful but hollow portrayal of 
friendship, age and mortality.

“He has a turban, and has 

long hair like a girl … like why 
would anyone like him?”

At 
sixteen 
years 
old, 

standing under a staircase 
in high school, I heard a 
conversation about me and a 
painful perception that has 
shaped an unfortunate view 
about how I see myself and 
how I thought others saw me. I 
could never look like those tall 
white guys in the Young Life 
youth group. I could never look 
like the guys wearing Brooks 
Brothers polos and backward 
snapbacks that I saw at Grand 
Valley State University. I was 
not good enough because of 
the way I looked.

Immigrants’ 
sons 
are 

taught to hustle. We are 
taught to make a name for 
ourselves and fly from the 
launch pads our parents made 
out of love, tears, sweat and 
blood in order for us to have 
the lives we are so blessed to 
have. Coming into college, I 
took this mantra in everything 
I did. From a high school 
experience where I felt closed 
up with no purpose, I took 
on my freshman year full-on. 
I was loud and opinionated, 
I made sure people knew I 
had a say because I felt that 

I did not have a say for so 
long in my hometown, where 
micro-aggressions and subtle 
racism helped diminish my 
voice. In trying to protect my 
voice, I closed off the voices 
of others in the process. My 
ego took over in wanting to 
be the immigrant son who 
did 
important 
work 
and 

made moves to accomplish 
things in order to honor my 
parents’ sacrifice. I wanted 
to define myself so badly in a 
place that was so big when my 
insecurities made me feel so 
small that I did not think of 
the consequences.

Being the good immigrants’ 

son that I was, I accomplished 
what I set out to do. I started 
groups, I helped lead groups. 
I was involved with activist 
movements that set precedent 
for 
public 
universities. 
I 

helped build startups that 
provided value to consumers. 
I 
performed 
service 
to 

communities as mandated in 
Sikhism through the concept 
of Seva (Selfless service). I 
was admitted into specialty 
programs and received media 
commendation. 
This 
“Me. 

Me. Me” monologue could 
continue, but it stops when I 
pause to reflect on “at what 
cost did I achieve?” I alienated 
some of the first people I met 
in 
college; 
I 
overpowered 

kind, soft spoken people when 

I spoke because of a need to 
make sure I was heard, since 
I was so scared of losing my 
voice. For years, my arrogance 
pushed away the first girl in 
my life to make me feel OK 
with what I looked like and 
who I was. Someone so kind, 
and because of weaknesses 
that I failed to address, things 
ended abruptly. In trying to 
pursue what I thought were 
ideals during my early years of 
college, I lost far too much to 
feel wholesome.

For 
me, 
internships 

unfortunately did not mitigate 
this, 
but 
amplified 
this 

behavior. Finance operates, at 
times, in a vacuum. So long as 
you do good work, reduce costs 
and support the firm, no one 
really cares what you do. The 
worst part is they incentivize 
you to be that way. In some 
of the places I worked, I saw 
people with gigantic egos and 
wallets, all the while stretched 
thin. As a result, they had 
little time with the people 
who mattered most in a place 
that applauded your work 
above all. And I am ashamed 
to say it got to me. It made 
me tougher, more critical, 
more in tune to senseless 
office 
politics 
and 
more 

aggressive in recognizing my 
accomplishments 
to 
senior 

management. By the time I 
realized how business had 

changed me, it was far too late.

I realized how alone I felt 

and that I wanted to be loved. 
I kept a lower profile and 
apologized to as many people 
who were willing to listen. 
I tried to listen more than I 
spoke and admit when I do not 
know enough about a situation. 
I became less influenced by 
money and asked myself what 
was important and who was 
important. 
I 
spent 
nights 

crying in my room asking to 
turn back time and begging 
for a redo. From persuasion 
through friends who cared 
enough about me to tell me 
the truth, I stopped chasing 
after the people who were not 
willing to listen that I was 
trying to be different. And 
with that, I could not blame 
them for their interpretation 
of my character, given what 
they saw in the past.

I spent time trying to 

understand love and what 
that meant. In London, it 
was looking at my Indian 
grandfather smile at photos 
of my deceased grandmother. 
It meant that no matter what 
racism my grandfather faced 
in England, or how many 
people alienated my white 
grandmother for being with 
my grandpa, that love was love 
and it was going to endure 
until the end. It meant taking 
time to talk to my neighbors in 

Buenos Aires who explained 
that love is a growing thing, 
not a constant. That you love 
more and more every day that 
you know someone and it is 
not something that you try to 
rekindle over time because 
it dies out after marriage. It 
meant my mother following 
my father to a home 3,000 
miles away and holding each 
other while crying the first 
day in their new apartment 
because they knew they were 
going to make it together 
— without hesitation. Once 
I came to understand it, I 
realized I wanted it to be a 
part of me so long as I was 
happy with being myself first.

How 
can 
a 
Sikh 
boy 

atoning for his past find love 
in Ann Arbor? In a place 
where I am reminded I am 
an outsider, where recently 
several women laughed as a 
man sneered while telling me 
to “go back to my country,” 
how can I find something 
meaningful? My immigrant 
parents fell in love in months 
and knew they would be with 
each other forever. I cannot 
taper or dilute my happiness, 
excitement, pain and sadness 
like the white boys and girls 
were taught. As a means of 
longevity and survival, the 
communities I was raised 
in 
promoted 
being 
blunt 

and candid and open. There 

was not time for nuance or 
diminished feelings. I was 
told to wear my heart on my 
sleeve. When I am happy or 
upset, I make it known to the 
people who matter. When I 
am confused, I try to reach 
out and ask for clarity. I try to 
make people feel special if I 
truly feel they are special.

In a town where if I look 

for a special someone to grow 
something greater with then 
I am called naïve, or called a 
coward for not bringing the 
first girl at the bar who wants 
to learn about my turban 
back to my place, how can I 
find 
someone 
worthwhile? 

And even if I find that girl, 
can I be genuine given my 
insecurities? I look to my past 
and pray that I have changed 
when I ask if there is a me 
that is not defined by others? 
Is there so much G.S. that 
there is not enough room for 
another person in my heart? 
Will implicit racism and bias 
bring poison and fear into the 
relationships that I have had, 
tearing it apart? Or maybe 
I still feel like that 16-year-
old 
under 
the 
staircase? 

And will that hold me back 
from the courage to start the 
conversation?

How do I become more than 

what is assumed of me?

Officials say sites 
will be open to the 
public within the 
next two weeks 

By MARLEE BREAKSTONE

Daily Staff Reporter

After delays due to warm 

weather in December, a planned 
installation of three natural ice 
skating rinks is underway in the 
city of Ann Arbor.

Located 
at 
Allmendinger, 

Burns and Northside parks, 
installations 
for 
the 
project 

began 
Monday 
afternoon 

with the laying of water for 
the 
ice 
rink. 
Now-former 

City Councilmember Stephen 
Kunselman proposed the use 
of $89,169 from the city’s cash 
reserves to create the ice rinks 
before his term ended in 2015. 
The allocation was approved 
as part of the 2015 to 2016 Ann 
Arbor city budget.

The ice rinks will be added 

to Veterans Memorial Park and 
Buhr Park.

In 
an 
interview, 

Councilmember 
Julie 
Grand 

(D–Ward 3), who is involved 
in the city’s Parks Advisory 
Commission, said the locations 
were chosen both to spread 
the rinks around the city and 

make them accessible to the 
community, as well as based on 
where rinks have been located 
historically in the city.

Colin Smith, the city’s parks 

and recreation manager, said 
it will take 10 to 14 days for the 
ice to achieve the desired four 
inches of thickness. He said 
staff will return to the rinks 
nightly during this time period 
to rewater the rinks until the 
ice hits four inches. [COPY: 
“achieves the desired thickness” 
is repeated twice — consider 
rephrasing]

Grand said usage of the rinks 

will be available free of charge, 
and the rinks will be open to the 
public during regular park hours 
shortly.

“In about two weeks, weather 

permitting, we should see the 
signs removed and (the rinks) 
will be open for the public to 
skate,” Grand said.

According to Grand, one-third 

of the budget for the project will 
be designated for parts that can 
be reused, such as the frame of 
the rinks, with the remainder 
being allocated toward staff 
labor, 
a 
potentially 
ongoing 

expense.

She said she is thrilled about 

the ice rinks and the Ann 
Arbor community shares her 
sentiment.

“I honestly have not heard 

anyone say they are unanimously 

excited about any topic other 
than the skating rink,” she said. 
“Everyone is excited about it.

Law Prof. David Santacroce, 

who is chair of the Ann Arbor 
Parks 
Advisory 
Commission, 

said by building the ice rinks, the 
city of Ann Arbor is recognizing 
a desire among residents for 
recreational activities such as 
ice skating. Several commercial 
rinks currently exist in and near 
to the city.

“People want to skate and 

they’d like to do it closer to 
home and for free if possible,” 
Santacroce said. “If we can 
get (the rinks) established, if 
the 
weather 
cooperates, 
it’s 

a great parks service for the 
community.”

Vizzini, who grew up in the area, 
said the ice rinks would be a 
great addition to the town.

“I used to have a homemade 

ice rink at my house when I was 
younger and it was incredible,” 
Vizzini said.

Grand encouraged community 

members to skate at the rink, 
and said she’s hopeful that large 
crowds at the rinks prompt more 
city projects like it in the future.

“If they are widely used, then 

it will give a message to the 
city that more money should be 
budgeted towards ice rinks and 
similar projects in the future,” 
she said.

Detroit Regional 
Chamber honors 
state Rep. Adam 

Zemke

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Along with several other 

Michigan legislators, one of 
Ann Arbor’s own was named 
a 2016 Lawmaker to Watch 
Wednesday.

The 
Detroit 
Regional 

Chamber 
included 
state 

Rep. Adam Zemke (D–Ann 
Arbor) in their newest list 
of 
impactful 
lawmakers. 

Zemke was one of six state 
legislators named, and the 
only 
Democratic 
House 

member on the list.

In a press release, Zemke 

said he feels honored to 
have been named and looks 
forward to continuing his 
work.

“I am honored by and 

deeply appreciative of this 
recognition,” he said. “While 
people of Washtenaw County 
are my first priority, it is 
also my responsibility as 
a legislator to think and 
act 
broadly, 
to 
vote 
my 

conscience and to help enact 
change I believe is necessary 

and beneficial in our state 
as a whole. I look forward 
to 
continuing 
this 
work, 

along with my Democratic 
and Republican colleagues, 
on issues that matter in 
our county, our region, and 
across Michigan.”

Jim 
Martinez, 
director 

of communications for the 
DRC, said Zemke was chosen 
because of his commitment 
to improving the state and 
region.

“We look for lawmakers 

from 
both 
sides 
of 
the 

aisle who are committed 
to 
finding 
solutions 
and 

creating policy that moves 
the state forward,” he said. 
“Rep. Zemke has proven to 
take a pragmatic approach to 
policy. He’s supported some 
issues that are important to 
our members, and to growing 
the economy and increasing 
prosperity and growth.”

In an interview, Zemke 

said he believes the DRC 
selected 
him 
because 
of 

his work pushing forward 
legislation, particularly in 
education and infrastructure 
investments.

Zemke 
mentioned 

although he does not agree 
with 
 
members 
of 
the 

chamber of commerce all of 
the time, he is able to work 
with them productively to 

acheive his goals.

“Locally and regionally 

our views are in line on 
many issues on how to move 
Michigan forward,” he said. 
“I think that this award is a 
kind of recognition of that 
work and my ability to move 
legislation forward.”

Looking 
at 
upcoming 

legislation, Zemke said he 
is 
currently 
working 
on 

bills relating to funding for 
Detroit public schools and 
pedestrian safety.

“We’re going to be working 

on legislation that deals with 
the Detroit Public Schools, 
because they have significant 
financial issues,” he said. 
“We are also going to be 
dealing with some legislation 
that I have been working 
on for quite some time on 
pedestrian safety and dealing 
with that on a statewide 
basis.”

As well, Zemke said he 

is also working on several 
election year efforts.

“I am likely to run for 

reelection again this year,” 
he said. “I am also serving 
as chairperson of the House 
Democrats 
election 
effort 

and we are trying to win 
a 
majority 
in 
November. 

Those are what I’m going 
to be focused on in terms of 
politics.”

Results from 

M-City research 
revealed at Detroit 
auto show Monday

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

In 
collaboration 
with 

Ford Motor Companies, the 
University has participated in 
an automotive project to test 
autonomous 
vehicles 
during 

winter conditions — the first 
of its kind — both groups 
announced Monday during the 
North American International 
Auto Show.

Researchers 
from 
the 

University 
and 
Ford 
tested 

Ford Fusion Hybrids at MCity, 
the 
University’s 
test-cite 

for driverless vehicles in a 
simulated 
city 
environment 

opened 
earlier 
this 
year. 

According to a press release, 

the goal of the testing was to 
observe how LiDAR sensors on 
the vehicles would operate in 
winter conditions.

LiDAR 
sensors 
generate 

points of laser lights to help 
automated vehicles navigate, 
creating 
three-dimensional 

images of objects surrounding 
the road such as signs and trees, 
as well as the road itself. They 
also help automobiles calculate 
precise lane locations.

Ryan 
Eustice, 
associate 

professor of architecture and 
engineering and a researcher 
involved in the project, said in 
a statement that maps and GPS 
systems provided by outside 
companies 
do 
not 
function 

consistently in harsh winter 
terrains.

“The 
ones 
developed 
by 

Ford 
and 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
do 
(function 

consistently),” 
Eustice 
said. 

“The maps we create contain 
useful information about the 
3D environment around the car, 

allowing it to localize even with 
a blanket of snow covering the 
ground.”

He added that while LiDAR 

images are implemented to 
prevent accidents in hazardous 
winter conditions, inclement 
weather can cause snow to 
block roads and prevents the 
sensor from detecting it.

In his remarks during the 

auto show Monday, Raj Nair, 
Ford executive vice president 
and chief technical officer, 
said Ford has been testing 
autonomous vehicles for close 
to a decade and looks forward to 
developing the project further.

“Snow is one of the most 

extreme 
driving 
conditions. 

Snow 
blocks 
sensors 
and 

obviously 
creates 
slippery 

conditions. So, this testing will 
help us take fully autonomous 
vehicles to the ultimate level.”

Apart from Michigan, Ford is 

also testing driverless cars on 
roads in California and Texas.

University collaborates with 
Ford to test autonomous cars

like you are perceived and 

treated like you do not belong on 
a national level, particularly when 
the discourse is so vitriolic, has 
damaging effects on students.”

Law student Sarah Alsaden, 

treasurer of the Muslim Law 
Students Association, said since 
the media has a considerable 

impact in portraying minorities, 
it is important for it to maintain 
a neutral light when covering 
terrorism news.

Alsaden 
added 
that 
she 

believes the climate at the 
University 
toward 
Muslim 

students 
could 
be 
further 

improved if students listened 
more to how their peers felt about 
being represented negatively in 
the media.

“The media does put a focus 

on labelling Muslims as violent, 
which isn’t the same for other 
races or religions,” Alsaden 
said. “It is important that these 
harmful stereotypes are removed 
and we all become allies.”

Saleem said her team is 

currently working to publish 
longitudinal data about how 
reliance on media for information 
affect 
non-Muslims’ 
views 

toward Muslims over the course 
of three months.

State Rep. Adam Zemke (D-Ann Arbor) speaks at the Ann Arbor City Club on September 15th, 2014.


By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

The 
phone 
camera 
rolls. 

Kelsey 
Mitchell 
and 
Jillian 

Dunston are in the imagined 
setting 
of 
a 
mall. 
They’re 

complaining about being there 
for too long, waiting for Siera 
Thompson, who is shopping.

On the court, Mitchell and 

Dunston 
are 
the 
Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team’s 

top 
forwards 
and 
scrappy 

rebounders. 
But 
this 
is 

Instagram, and this is a different 
side of the two athletes.

Thompson returns through 

a door in a sweatsuit outfit, 
asking the other two if they 
like it. The video is supposed to 
include the Webster Dictionary 
word of the day. Today’s word is 
fitness.

Mitchell 
brings 
in 
the 

punchline, “Now she know she 
don’t FITNESS jacket.”

For 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball fans, it seems like 
the senior forward Mitchell 
has just started to come out of 
her shell. After a career mired 
with injuries and a slow start to 
her senior campaign, Mitchell 
has come alive in the past two 
games.

When 
the 
team 
needed 

strength and finesse in the paint 
down by 17 against Iowa on Jan. 

7, Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico turned to Mitchell. In her 
fourth career start, Mitchell led 
an improbable comeback win 
with 15 points and 11 rebounds. 
She rode the momentum to 
another 
stellar 
performance 

against Minnesota three days 
later, nearly earning her second 
straight double-double with 13 
points and nine rebounds.

Mitchell 
is 
soft-spoken 

both on and off the court. But 
it depends who she is talking 
to and the occasion. To her 
teammates, she’s always been 
out of her shell. She is described 
by Barnes Arico as a monster 
on the court but overall even-
keeled. Her emotion was in full 
force when she let out a yell after 
blocking a shot late in the game 
against Iowa. But for the most 
part, Mitchell stays quiet and 
takes care of business.

Scouting reports will say to 

watch her signature slick spin 
move toward the baseline, but 
most people outside Mitchell’s 
team, friends and family would 
know that she has a knack for 
cracking jokes.

“She is hysterical,” Barnes 

Arico said. “She is the funniest 
person I may have met in my 
entire life, and you wouldn’t 
know that probably talking to 
the media. But if you got her 
outside of media, if you ever 

check out Webster’s Word of 
the Day on Instagram, you’ll die 
(laughing).”

Mitchell, 
the 
sophomore 

forward Dunston and the junior 
guard Thompson have made 
multiple 
15-second 
comedy 

sketches, using whatever the 
word of the day is in a witty way 
during the skit. The puns are 
inventive and reveal the comedic 
affinity all three possess. 

In one skit, Mitchell and 

Thompson are sitting down, 
acting like it’s getting late and 
it’s time for one of them to go 
home. Mitchell asks to spend the 
night. Thompson says, “Now you 
know my granny be trippin’. She 
don’t like last-minute stuff.”

Mitchell 
responds: 
“Man, 

ALASKA. Granny Pearl!”

Dunston appears from behind 

a door frame, glasses half way 
down her nose, yelling with a 
drawl, “Yes?!”

In this twisting of words, 

Alaska is said instead of “I’ll ask 
her.”

There’s 
more 
to 
Kelsey 

Mitchell than just a focused 
basketball player. It may have 
taken a while for Michigan fans 
to discover, but with her videos 
as proof, the wait was worth 
it. Now, if she can stay in the 
spotlight, fans will continue to 
uncover the multiple features 
that make up her personality.

‘M’ hosts No. 3 Maryland

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

coach John Beilein began his 
Monday press conference with 
an unprompted 
injury 
update 

on senior guard 
Caris 
LeVert 

and 
a 
tinge 

of 
tongue-in-

cheek flare.

“You 
all 

want 
your 

Caris 
report, 

right?” Beilein 
asked a group 
of reporters. “It 
seems 
we’ve 

been having the 
injury 
report 

here for about three years.

“The injury report is less 

pain every day, less yesterday. 
We elected not to have him still 
practice yesterday because (we 
want to) let the healing try to 
complete itself. I’m not optimistic 
about (him playing) tomorrow. 
The longer it goes, the more he’s 
going to need two or three days of 
practice, or he won’t be ready or 
we can risk further injuring it. So 
that’s what I got to say and that’s 
what I prefer to say. So if you ask 
me anything more, I already said 
it — and I said it well. It was well 
said.”

The 
Wolverines 
(2-1 
Big 

Ten, 12-4 overall) will likely be 
without their top scorer again 
Tuesday night when they host 
No. 3 Maryland. Meanwhile, the 
Terrapins’ most productive player, 
guard Melo Trimble, is coming off 
a 21-point performance on the road 
against Wisconsin on Saturday.

In Madison, Trimble showed 

why he was the preseason pick 
for Big Ten Player of the Year. On 
top of his game-high 21 points, 
he dished out five assists, and 
with time expiring, he buried a 
3-pointer to send Maryland (4-0, 

15-1) home victorious.

“He just comes down the 

court, there was no panic at all,” 
Beilein said of Trimble’s latest 
performance. “It reminded me 
of a guy we had as well. … He 
obviously, like Trey Burke, is a 
tremendous player, but he’s also 
got — like Trey Burke — a lot of 
pieces around him.”

Maryland has five players 

averaging double-digit scoring 
per contest and plays with two 
true big men, Damonte Dodd and 
Diamond Stone — both 6-foot-11. 
Stone is pacing 13 points and five 
rebounds per game.

Add 
in 
guard 
Rasheed 

Sulaimon, who is pacing 10 points 
and four assists per game, and 
forwards 
Jake 
Layman 
(10.7 

points, 5.3 rebounds, 1.1 assists) 
and Robert Carter Jr. (12.6, 6.9, 
1.8), and it makes sense that 
Maryland has been a popular 

Final Four pick.

“They’ve got a lot of people that 

can make good plays for them,” 
Beilein said. “They’ve got seniors; 
they’ve got juniors. We’re down to 
two juniors again for the second 
straight year, so it is what it is.”

With 
LeVert 
sidelined, 

sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman has started 
in his place. Abdur-Rahkman 
had a career night on Thursday at 
Purdue, scoring a career-high 25 
points. But despite the explosive 
scoring performance, he had just 
two assists in 39 minutes.

“That’s something you have to 

work on, seeing the whole floor 
and not just two actions or two 
players on the court,” Abdur-
Rahkman said. “So I just want to 
get better at that.”

On the defensive end, Abdur-

Rahkman may be more prepared 
than his teammates to take on 

Trimble. The two played together 
when Abdur-Rahkman lived in 
the Washington D.C. area from 
when he was nine years old until 
his junior year of high school, but 
Abdur-Rahkman said Trimble’s 
game has changed since when the 
two used to play together.

Junior guard Derrick Walton 

has also tried to take on more 
responsibility 
with 
LeVert 

injured, but he has struggled to 
find his touch since conference 
play started, going 8-for-25 from 
the field in three Big Ten games.

Tuesday’s game presents an 

opportunity for Michigan to 
get its first marquee win in a 
conference in which home wins 
are essential due to the difficulty 
of winning on the road.

“If you’re going to be in the 

NCAA picture, you’ve got to win 
almost all your home games,” 
Beilein said.

Terps’ Trimble 
talks leadership

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

The 
Maryland 
men’s 

basketball team has no shortage 
of weapons, but sophomore point 
guard Melo Trimble proved this 
weekend 
that 
he 

is 
chief 

among 
them.

With 12 

seconds 
remaining 
and the score tied in a difficult 
road matchup at Wisconsin on 
Saturday, the Preseason Big Ten 
Player of the Year dribbled up the 
court and took the game into his 
own hands.

Instead of trying to run a 

play or drive to the rim, Trimble 
confidently 
stepped 
up 
and 

buried a long 3-pointer with 1.2 
seconds left to give the third-
ranked Terrapins the victory.

In October, the Daily caught 

up with the Terrapins’ star 
player at Big Ten Media Day in 
Chicago.

The 
Michigan 
Daily: 

Maryland 
has 
much 
higher 

expectations this year than in 
recent years. Has the team had 
a chance to react to those yet? 
Does 
that 
change 
anything 

heading into the season?

Melo Trimble: I think we’re 

confident as a group, but I think 
more so, we want to work and 
just keep grinding. It’ll take the 
little things to be a great team, 
and I think from the summer to 
the fall ’til now, I think the team 
— the way we’re headed, the 
direction we’re headed — we feel 
that we can do great things, and 
we have a good group.

TMD: 
Over 
the 
summer, 

you got a personal invitation 

from Steph Curry to go to one 
of his camps. What was that 
experience like?

MT: It was a great experience. 

I got a chance to train with Steph 
Curry, I got a chance to be beside 
him. It was very exciting — he 
was the MVP last season and 
won the championship, and just 
being beside him, seeing how 
he shoots the ball was a great 
experience.

TMD: Did you get a chance 

to pick his brain at all? Get any 
advice from him?

MT: I just asked him, “What 

does it take to win?” And he told 
me, “Work ethic.” Work, work, 
work, just being a leader, being 
myself.

TMD: There were a lot of 

high schoolers at the camp, too. 
Were you working mostly on 
yourself, or were you also in an 
instructional role?

MT: I was a teacher at the 

camp, I talked to young guys 
in the groups. It was mostly 
me being a leader, being very 
vocal. I’m not used to teaching a 
group of guys. It’s something I’m 
working on, being a leader. I think 
that camp was a good experience.

TMD: You’re pretty young 

still yourself, with just one year 
of college basketball under your 
belt. What kinds of things have 
you learned in that short time 
that you were able to impart on 
those younger kids?

MT: I would say, just know 

yourself, know what you do best, 
and continue to stay in the gym, 
because that’s what I did. I didn’t 
think I was gonna have the year 
I had last year before the season 
started. It just came from me 
getting confidence (and from) my 
teammates, my coaches, always 
having a good relationship with 
my coaching staff.

Fourth line shows energy, 
Berenson shuffles D-men

Shuart and Dancs 
impress by doing 
the dirty work in 

opportune moments

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Editor

The fourth line of a hockey 

team can sometimes serve as the 
utility line. The line gets to play 
whenever 
the 

coach thinks a 
change of pace 
is needed in the game.

For Michigan, the fourth line 

has been all that and more.

With the Wolverines recently 

adding a seventh defenseman, a 
hole has been left on the fourth 
line. But there are two forwards 
who have consistently been on 
the fourth line there to keep 
it steady: sophomore Dexter 
Dancs and junior Max Shuart. 
The duo combined for just two 
goals and an assist against 
Michigan State this weekend, 
but Dancs’ goal late in the 
first period against Michigan 
State on Saturday jumpstarted 
Michigan’s offensive attack.

“They’re trying to play hockey 

the right way,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “Part of 
their game is jumping on loose 
pucks and forechecking. You saw 
Shuart do that 
on Friday and 
set (freshman 
forward) 
Brendan 
Warren up for 
a great scoring 
chance. 
And 

then 
he 
did 

that 
with 

Dancs 
on 

Saturday. 
It’s 

just checking 
hard, creating 
a turnover and throwing it in 
front of the net.

“If that line adds energy to 

our team, and can create a little 
offense in the meantime and 

avoid being scored against, then 
they’re a positive on our team.

But like any line in hockey, 

the fourth line isn’t perfect. 
While Shuart centers the line, 
he isn’t a natural-born center. 
Berenson counters this problem 
by grouping the two fourth 
liners with another center at 
certain points in the game so 
that Shuart can play his natural 
position on the wing.

“When we put (senior forward 

Boo Nieves) out there with them, 
Boo is our best faceoff man, 
so that helps take some of the 
pressure off Shuart,” Berenson 
said. “Shuart is a natural winger 
so he can go to the wing, and 
Dancs can go on the off wing and 
still be effective.”

All 
things 
considered, 

Berenson was impressed with 
his fourth line this weekend.

“I thought this was (Shuart 

and Dancs’) best weekend,” 
Berenson said.

PLAYING 
SEVEN 

DEFENSEMEN: 
With 
the 

emergence 
of 
sophomore 

defenseman Sam Piazza during 
the Great Lakes Invitational, 
Berenson has switched from the 
traditional six-man defense to a 
seven-man defensive system.

The system has its advantages 

in that the defensive pairings 
don’t have to be broken up if a 
defenseman goes to the penalty 
box.

That 

means 
that 

Piazza, 
as 

the 
seventh 

defenseman, 
has to rotate 
playing with 
different 
defensemen 
rather 
than 

having 
one 

consistent 
partner.

“It’s been 

different for me,” Piazza said. 
“This past weekend, I played 
with just about everyone.”

The 
seven-man 
defensive 

system 
also 
speaks 
to 
the 

depth 
of 
the 
Wolverines, 

especially with another capable 
defenseman, 
senior 
Kevin 

Lohan, still injured.

Though the unconventional 

defensive system leaves a hole on 
the fourth line, Berenson uses 
the gap to double shift skaters 
and give his other players more 
time on the ice.

The jury is still out on the 

seven-defensemen system, and 
Berenson mentioned that it will 
continue to be evaluated.

“I don’t have a strong opinion 

of it just yet, but I definitely 
think it helped us this past 
weekend,” Berenson said. “It’ll 
be week-to-week whether we 
play it or not.”

SECOND 
STRAIGHT 

HOME-AND-HOME: With a 
home-and-home series against 
Michigan State just completed, 
the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team 

will play another home-and-
home series against Ohio State. 
The Wolverines will travel to 
Columbus on Friday before 
returning home to face the 
Buckeyes at Yost Ice Arena on 
Sunday.

While there is a little more 

travel time required for the 
teams than there was against 
Michigan State, Berenson says 
he is a fan of the home-and-
home series.

“I like it,” Berenson said. “As a 

coach, I like going into the other 
team’s building, where if you 
have a good game, you have the 
chance to sweep at home. On the 
other side of it, the fans get to 
see a game every weekend.”

INJURY UPDATE: Lohan 

has 
been 
out 
since 
mid-

November with a lower-body 
injury. After an original return 
date set for the Nov. 20 game 
against 
Boston 
University, 

Lohan suffered a setback in his 
recovery and was delayed until 
after the GLI.

Berenson told the Daily on 

Monday that Lohan is skating 
on his own and will try to 
practice with the team this 
weekend.
