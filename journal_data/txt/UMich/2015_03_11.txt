CELEBRATING OUR ONE-HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

RESEARCH

Poorer residents 

isolated in 

industrial, eastern 
Washtenaw County

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

The University and the City 

of Ann Arbor take pride in the 
scores of “top 10” rankings they 
rack up each year. However, the 
Ann Arbor and its surround-
ing areas may not be pleased to 
reach the top of one particular 
list.

The Ann Arbor Metropoli-

tan Area was ranked the eighth 
most economically segregated 
metro area in the United States, 
according to a recent study from 
the University of Toronto’s Mar-
tin Prosperity Institute. Talla-
hassee, Fla. ranked first.

“Segregated City: The Geog-

raphy of the Economic Segrega-

tion in America’s Metros” looked 
at economic segregation in more 
than 350 metropolitan areas 
across the United States and 
attempted to draw connections 
to other characteristics of these 
areas including income, race, 
political orientation and housing 
costs.

In this study, segregation 

means that members of a par-
ticular category are more likely 
to live amongst themselves, as 
opposed to living with mem-
bers from different occupational 
demographics. For example, a 
high ranking for segregation of 
the wealthy means the wealthy 
are more likely to live near other 
wealthy people than in more 
diversely populated areas.

“Economic 
segregation” 
is 

composed of three types of seg-
regation: income segregation, 
educational 
segregation 
and 

occupational segregation.

Income 
segregation 
draws 

a contrast between those who 
are “wealthy” and those who

Robert Sellers, vice provost for equity, inclusion and academic affairs, speaks during the First Generation Dinner on Tuesday in the Michigan Union Ballroom. 

Over dinner, speakers 

discuss magnitude 
of the decision to 

attend the University

By JING JING MA

Daily Staff Reporter

For LSA senior Christina Cas-

tillo, attending college was not 
just the natural next step after 

graduating high school — it was 
a life changer. In addition to her 
role as a University student, Cas-
tillo is a single mother.

The 
student-run 
organiza-

tion First Generation Students @ 
Michigan provided Castillo the 
opportunity to share her experi-
ence as both a mother and a first 
generation college student Tues-
day evening at its “First Genera-
tion Dinner.”

First Gen raises awareness 

for and addresses the unique 

needs of first generation college 
students. The organization was 
founded in the fall of 2007 and is 
the first student-led organization 
of its type in the country.

After attending high school 

in California, Castillo dropped 
in and out of community college 
since 2003 for about a decade 
because of an abusive home life.

“My daughter and I were 

domestic violence victims,” she 
said. “I left everything when I 
left my daughter’s father. I was 

having a hard time being on wel-
fare and felt like I was always 
struggling — I decided then that 
college was the way to go.”

Castillo has always wanted to 

attend the University. In 2013, 
she enrolled at the age of 28.

“I left everything in Califor-

nia and came on a train with 
my daughter,” Castillo said. 
“(Attending the University) has 
been the hardest thing ever in my 
life. Having to be first generation,

Two new candidates 
enter Democratic 

races ahead of
August primary

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

With the Ann Arbor City 

Council’s August primary elec-
tions approaching, two new can-
didates pulled petitions to run 
for office last Thursday. Two 
current members of the coun-
cil announced their re-election 
campaigns last week as well.

Council members Jack Eaton 

(D–Ward 4) and Mike Anglin 
(D–Ward 5) will both run for 
re-election, facing Democrats 
Jaime Magiera and Chip Smith, 
respectively.

To earn a spot on the ballot, 

candidates must collect 100 peti-
tion signatures.

Eaton is a labor attorney who 

has lived in Ann Arbor for 30 
years. He joined the council in 
2013. Anglin, a retired teacher 
and electrician, was elected to

Daily Staff Reporter

The Michigan Daily will be 

exploring Ann Arbor’s most quirky, 
lively, and student populated neigh-
borhoods during the next month to 
see what makes this city tick. Start-
ing with the North Ingalls and Old 
Fourth Ward areas, keep checking 
back for more installments of our 
series on Ann Arbor’s neighbor-
hoods.

When students venture north 

of the Diag, they stumble upon Old 
Fourth Ward and North Ingalls, 
two of Ann Arbor’s 11 thriving, 
unofficial neighborhoods. Spread 
throughout the city, each area 
possesses different characteris-
tics, attractions and features.

Old Fourth Ward stretches 

between Fifth Avenue and State 
Street and spans north to Beakes 
Street. To the east, North Ingalls 
is 
nestled 
behind 
Rackham 

Graduate School and lies directly 
north of Central Campus.

Both 
neighborhoods 
are 

known for their proximity to Ann 
Arbor’s Main Street area and his-
toric Kerrytown Market.

HARP ON IT
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

New York University’s admin-

istration and Graduate Student 
Organizing 
Committee 
suc-

cessfully reached an agreement 
after five hours of negotiations 
in which graduate students 
called for an increase in teach-
ing wages, The Washington 
Square News reported Tuesday. 
The agreement prevented an 
impending four-day strike.

Following the announcement, 

the GSOC released several terms 
of the accepted agreement. These 
include a 100 percent increase in 
graduate student wages, which 
entails pay of $20 per hour for 
graduate student teachers in 
NYU’s Polytechnic School of 
Engineering, for example.

Additionally, the university 

offered to subsidize 90 percent 
of health care for every gradu-
ate student who is not already 
covered.

Negotiations between NYU’s 

administration and GSOC began 
in December of 2013. At that 
time, the GSOC was seeking 100 
percent subsidized health care, 
wage increases to $25 per hour 
and complete remission of stu-
dent tuition.

University of Texas students 

create university’s first 
LGBT-inclusive sorority

University of Texas at Austin 

students have established the 
school’s first queer-orientated 
sorority, Gamma Rho Lambda, 

to provide an open and education 
space for LGBTQ community, 
The Daily Texan reported Tues-
day. It is the first sorority on UT’s 
campus to both be queer-focused 
and transsexual inclusive.

Because the organization has 

not yet received a charter from 
nationals, it is currently con-
sidered a “colony.” As part of 
a three-semester colonization 
process, the sorority has already 
recruited nine members and will 
begin accepting pledges during 
the Fall 2015 semester. Lauren 
Ferguson, a senior majoring in 
art history and English, is the 
colony’s president.

POTUS calls for rise 
in loan affordability

Body also considers 

off campus 

lighting and sexual 
misconduct policy

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

During the body’s first meet-

ing after Spring Break, Central 
Student Government heard pro-
posals on fossil fuel divestment, 
increasing off-campus lighting 
and the inclusion of the Univer-
sity’s Student Sexual Misconduct 
Policy on course syllabi.

Fossil fuel

A resolution to support the 

formation of an ad hoc commit-
tee to determine the propriety 
of the University’s investments 
in oil and coal was proposed by 
CSG representative Swathi Shan-
mugasundaram, an LSA sopho-
more, and the Divest and Invest 
campaign, a coalition of students, 
faculty, staff and community 
members.

The purpose of the suggested 

committee would be to research 
the University’s investments and 
use that information to create 
recommendations about whether 
or not the University should con-
tinue to invest in fossil fuels.

Law student Scott Bloomberg, 

a member of Divest and Invest 
and one of the authors of the 
resolution, said campus consen-
sus on climate change is evident 
based on data from the Graham 
Sustainability Institute as well as 
from faculty research and thus, 
it is a concern the University 
should address.

“The nature of oil and coal 

industries, products and actions 
of the industries are, without a 
doubt, antithetical to our core 
values of sustainability and our 
core academic mission,” Bloom-
berg said.

CSG President Bobby Dishell, 

a Public Policy senior, had ques-
tions about why the formation of 
the ad hoc group was necessary.

“Why 
can’t 
you 
do 
this 

research on your own and then 
come back and say, ‘By doing our 
research, we think these specific 

things?’ ” Dishell asked.

Bloomberg said the commit-

tee’s research would extend 
beyond looking at how much the 
University invests in these com-
panies.

“We’ll look at the moral 

and social implications of this, 
whether this aligns with our Uni-
versity values,” Bloomberg said.

He also said the University has 

determined its investment stan-
dards in the past for companies 
working with apartheid South 
Africa and tobacco companies in 
a similar manner.

According to the resolution, 

the committee would be simi-
lar to the Committee on Tobac-
co 
Investments, 
which 
was 

comprised of four professors, an 
undergraduate student, a gradu-
ate student, an administrator and 
an alum.

President Barack Obama 

announced plans on Tuesday 
to create a “student aid” bill of 
rights. Check michigandaily.
com for continuing coverage 
of the proposal.

Obama introduces 
“student aid bill 
of rights” during 

Georgia Tech speech

ATLANTA (AP) — Issuing a 

clarion call to Americans sad-
dled by student debt, President 
Barack Obama urged student 
borrowers Tuesday to stand up 
for their rights, and announced 
a medley of modest steps to 
bring some order to a notori-
ously chaotic system.

Obama unveiled his “stu-

dent aid bill of rights” before a 
gymnasium packed with nearly 
10,000 students at Georgia 
Tech, where he said the nation 
must mobilize to bring about 
deeper changes to student 
loans. Not only should every 
American be able to afford 
college, Obama said, they also 

should be able to afford the 
loan payments that kick in with 
a vengeance once they gradu-
ate.

“We’re trying to tackle this 

problem from every angle,” 
Obama said. “We want to make 
this experience more afford-
able, because you’re not just 
investing in yourselves, you’re 
investing in your nation.”

In the Oval Office ahead of 

his brief visit to Atlanta, Obama 
signed a presidential memo-
randum with policy tweaks 
that don’t require new legisla-
tion from Congress — a plus as 
far as the White House is con-
cerned. The memo targets third 
parties like Navient — formerly 
Sallie Mae — that contract with 
the government to collect on 
loans. Those companies will be 
required to better inform bor-
rowers about repayment options 
and notify them when they are 
delinquent, the White House 

said.

Obama also called for a single 

website where students can see 
all their federal loans in one 
place — a major problem for 
students with multiple loans or 
debt that’s been sold from lender 
to lender. He also called for a 
website where borrowers can 
file complaints.

The presidential steps aim to 

crack down on a student loan 
system known for being com-
plex and confusing to navigate. 
In recent years, lawsuits and 
critical 
government 
reports 

have cast a light on industry 
abuses and the difficulties fac-
ing borrowers.

A Consumer Financial Pro-

tection Bureau study last year 
found borrowers were getting 
little help when they ran into 
trouble and had few affordable 
repayment options. And in May, 
Sallie Mae reached a $60 mil-
lion settlement with the Justice 
Department to resolve allega-
tions it charged military mem-
bers excessive interest rates and 
improperly sought default judg-
ments.

When Vickie Kight of Hous-

ton couldn’t afford to pay the 
interest accruing on her loans, 
she turned to her loan servicer 
for help — and says she didn’t get 
it. Her wages being garnished, 
Kight dropped out of Louisiana’s 
Southern University, returning 
to school only years later once 
her finances were under control.

“They were very aggressive 

with me,” Kight said in an inter-
view. Her student loan servicer 
eventually passed her loan onto 
a collection agency. “That’s 
when it got really hectic. They 
weren’t providing much infor-
mation. They just said you owe 
this much to the bank.”

Obama also floated the pos-

sibility 
of 
proposing 
legal 

changes to how student loans 
are affected by bankruptcy. 
Currently, student loans cannot 
typically be discharged even in 
bankruptcy.

Council in 2007 and has since 
won re-election three times.

Smith moved to Ann Arbor in 

1995 to earn a master’s degree in 
landscape architecture from the 
University’s School of Natural 
Resources and Environment. He 
now works as a consultant with 
Wade Trim, Inc., an urban plan-
ning firm.

“I didn’t think I’d be here that 

long and I just ended up falling in 
love with the city,” Smith said. “I 
just think it is the most wonderful 
city to live in.”

After leading an unsuccessful 

write-in campaign against Anglin 
in 2013, Smith will again vie for a 
seat on City Council. He said he 
sees an opportunity to improve 
the quality of life for Ann Arbor 
residents.

“There are a lot of things that 

we need to do better,” Smith said. 
“I’m thinking specifically about 
pedestrian safety.”

In recent years, the city’s cross-

walk ordinance has been the sub-
ject of debate. In 2013, the City 
Council considered repealing the 
current ordinance, which requires 
drivers stop for pedestrians at the 
curb or edge of a crosswalk.

Smith said the city must be a 

safer place for bicyclists and driv-
ers as well.

He also voiced concern over 

the limited access to affordable 
housing in Ann Arbor, citing the 
need for more options for recent 
graduates as well as mid-level 
professionals, which he defined 
as workers earning roughly $12 to 
$20 per hour.

“I wouldn’t be able to live here 

if I hadn’t been able to afford a 
house on that kind of salary,” 
Smith said. “The fact that it’s 
now unattainable for people mak-
ing that kind of money is really a 
problem for us.”

Smith said he thinks Coun-

cil needs to work together more 

cohesively.

“I think my own personal 

approach to listening to people 
and working together is really 
based on this kind of Midwest-
ern, pragmatic, ‘let’s roll up our 
sleeves and do it ourselves, let’s 
find out what the best solution is,’ 
and I think that that’s really been 
kind of missing on council for a 
while,” Smith said.

Magiera has been an Ann 

Arbor resident for 26 years and 
graduated from the University 
with a degree in Performing Arts 
Technology. He currently works 
as an Information Technology 
specialist at the University while 
running a weekly technology talk 
show on WCBN 88.3 FM. He also 
runs a small programming, multi-
media and photography business.

In an e-mail to The Michigan 

Daily, Magiera said he wants to 
be on City Council so he can help 
Ann Arbor restore city services 
lost during the recent recession.

“I’d like to help bring those 

services back up to speed while 
continuing to grow the cultural 
aspects of the city,” Magiera said. 
“We have a wealth of resources 
available to achieve these goals. 
Some of those resources haven’t 
been tapped as much as they could 
be by Ann Arbor City Council.”

Magiera also said he plans to 

focus on increasing communica-
tion between the city government 
and its residents, as well as safe 
and reliable pedestrian and biking 
infrastructure and mass transit.

Councilmembers Sabra Briere 

(D–Ward 1), Jane Lumm (I–Ward 
2) and Stephen Kunselman (D–
Ward 3) are also up for re-election 
this year.

Briere is expected to face Uni-

versity alum Will Leaf, a former 
co-chair of the Mixed Use Party, 
while Lumm is expected to face 
Democrat Sally Hart Petersen, a 
former councilmember who ran 
unsuccessfully for mayor last 
year. Kunselman is expected to 
face LSA senior Zachary Acker-
man in the Democratic primary.

run my house, go to school and go 
to work — it’s just been non-stop. 
But I would never change any of 
that because it built my character 
and showed my daughter that she 
can be capable of anything.”

Faculty adviser Dwight Lang 

said in an e-mail interview that 
the purpose of the event is to pub-
licly recognize all first generation 
students at the University.

“(The dinner) recognizes and 

celebrates the presence of U of 
M students who are first in their 
families to attend and graduate 
from college,” Lang said. “In this 
sense the dinner is very inclu-
sive.”

Speaking at the dinner, Lang 

described the decision for first 
generation students to attend col-
lege as life altering.

“If you are the first in your fam-

ily to attend or graduate from col-
lege, going off to college can be a 
very powerful experience,” Lang 
said. “You’ve taken certain risks 
by going off to college and you’ve 
crossed boundaries to new places 

that maybe you aren’t familiar 
with, different in a variety of ways 
from the situations of your fami-
lies and communities where you 
grew up.”

Many students who chose to 

share their personal experienc-
es as the first in their family to 
attend college also emphasized 
the magnitude of the decision. A 
major theme of the evening cen-
tered on the analogy of attending 
college as taking a risk.

Engineering junior Chris Reyn-

olds said he identified strongly 
with that comparison as an out-
of-state first generation student.

“I’m from out of state and drove 

hundreds of miles to get here. My 
dad dropped me off and left the 
same night,” Reynolds said. “I 
don’t think of first generation stu-
dents as first generation students, 
I think of them as risk takers.”

LSA senior Daniel Park also 

said his identity as a first genera-
tion college student could some-
times be isolating. He said talking 
about his family background often 
elicited awkward responses.

“I’ve had friends and room-

mates ask me what my parents did 
and where they went to school,” 

Park said. “I would say that my 
mother is an interpreter and 
my father a small business owner. 
They were both laborers. People 
would respond with ‘Oh.’ ”

Lang said a major goal of the 

organization is to provide peer 
support for first generation stu-
dents who may have a different 
socio-economic background than 
most other students on campus. 
He said 87 percent of undergradu-
ates have parents with bachelors 
or professional degrees.

“The U of M is essentially a 

middle and upper-middle class 
institution,” Lang said. “First 
Generation Students @ Michigan 
helps students make social and 
personal adjustments to campus 
and academic environments they 
may not be familiar with.”

Castillo said one improvement 

the University could make would 
be to offer better community 
resources for first generation stu-
dents and student parents.

“Sometimes I would not have 

enough food on the table and 
still have to worry about being a 
student. The hardest thing was 
trying to balance everything and 
finding assistance from the Uni-

versity,” Castillo said. “There 
have been times where I’ve had to 
drag my kid to class and teachers 
were not always understanding.”

The University’s Office of the 

Vice Provost Equity, Inclusion 
and Academic Affairs also spon-

sored the dinner. University Vice 
Provost Robert M. Sellers spoke at 
the event and said it is important 
that the University have resourc-
es in place to meet the challenges 
faced by first generation students.

“Our goal is to work with the 

students, the faculty, as well as 
staff to help the University do a 
much better job of providing an 
elite education without being elit-
ist,” Sellers said. “The University 
of Michigan is your University. 
Never, ever, ever feel otherwise.”

are “poor,” whereas educational 
segregation identifies individu-
als by two specific groupings: 
non-high school graduates and 
college graduates.

Occupational 
segregation 

splits working people into three 
subcategories — creative, ser-
vice and working class. The 
“creative” class is defined to 
include jobs related to social sci-
ence, arts and STEM fields; the 
service class pertains to those 
who work jobs in retail and 
personal care, among others; 
and the working class address-
es those working in fields like 
maintenance and construction.

The average wage for cre-

ative class workers was $70,000 
per year; service class workers 
made approximately $30,000 
per year; members of the work-
ing class made $37,000 per year 
on average.

“All three types of segrega-

tion — income, educational, and 
occupational — are associated 
with one another,” the study 
notes. “If a metro is segregated 
on one dimension, it increases 
the likelihood of it being segre-
gated on the others.”

The study explains that tradi-

tionally, most research on eco-
nomic segregation uses income 
segregation as a sole parameter 
in their analysis.

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily, 
Charlotta 

Mellander, one of the study’s 
authors, said the inclusion of 
educational and occupational 
segregation is a reflection of 
income inequality in modern 
society.

“Today, we know that more 

than income matters when it 
comes to options in life,” she 
said. “What you’ve studied and 
what you work with matter to a 
large extent too. And these three 
factors — job, education and 
income — are often mentioned 
as the three major dividers.”

Occupational segregation
Donald 
Grimes, 
a 
senior 

research area specialist for the 
University’s Institute on Labor, 
Employment and the Economy, 
said he was not surprised with 
the Ann Arbor Metropolitan 
Area’s high ranking for occupa-
tional segregation in the study. 
The metro area was ranked fifth 
nationally in this category.

He said a main reason for 

this is the division between the 
western and eastern regions of 
Washtenaw County. The west-
ern part, he said, is a knowledge-
based economy. By contrast, the 
eastern part of the county has 
tended to be dependent on the 
manufacturing industry, which 
has taken a hit in terms of jobs 
and income in the past decade.

“Normally you don’t see quite 

as stark a divide between the 
activity in one part of the county 
and the activity in another part 
of the county,” he said, add-
ing that an area like Pittsfield 
Township has a mixture of the 
two types of economic activity. 
“It’s just this is enormous divide 
in the economic base of the 
Ypsilanti region and of the Ann 
Arbor region.”

Occupational 
segregation 

was most prevalent among Ann 
Arbor’s service class. Ann Arbor 
falls second only to Ithaca, New 
York as the most segregated ser-
vice class in the United States.

Ann Arbor’s working class 

was also segregated, but less so 
than the service class. It is the 
fifth most segregated working 
class in the nation, and this is 
positively associated with popu-
lation density, population size 
and income inequality, among 
other factors.

Additionally, segregation in 

the working class is associated 
with “the share of the workforce 
in the creative class, the share of 
adults with college degrees, and 
the concentration of high-tech 
industry.”

The study notes that the more 

an area’s industries are “knowl-
edge-based,” the more likely it 
is for members of the service 
and working classes to be seg-
regated.

Overall, 94 percent of citizens 

25 years and older in Washtenaw 
County — which includes the 
Ann Arbor Metropolitan Area 
— have a high school diploma, 
while 51.3 percent of citizens in 
this demographic hold a bach-
elor’s degree.

Poverty and the University
The metro area’s population 

of people classified as poor is 
also highly segregated. The Ann 
Arbor Metropolitan Area is the 
fifth most segregated area in 
this demographic nationally.

While the area is better off 

than the state of Michigan in 
terms of per capita income, 
median household income and 
bachelor degree achievement 
rates, poverty is still a challenge 

— 15.4 percent of the Ann Arbor 
Metropolitan Area’s population 
lived below the poverty line 
between 2009 and 2013. The 
rate for the whole state is 16.8 
percent for this period.

The study finds that one of the 

main reasons places like Ann 
Arbor are so economically seg-
regated, especially in the seg-
regation of the poor, is because 
of the presence of universities, a 
phenomenon referred to as the 
“town-gown split.”

“University faculty, students, 

and administrative staff cluster 
around campuses and the rest of 
the city is left to service work-
ers,” the study reads. “Often this 
pattern of economic segregation 
has been exacerbated by uni-
versity expansion efforts that 
encroached upon and displaced 
urban neighborhoods.”

The 
University 
currently 

enrolls 
43,710 
students 
and 

employs 45,397 people. It also 
owns roughly 9.4 percent of city 
land.

This was a major topic during 

last year’s mayoral race, in which 
candidates discussed potential 
solutions to the University’s 
expansion — the more property 
the University buys, the more tax 
revenue the city loses.

The overall issue of town-

gown relations raises the ques-
tion of whether Ann Arbor can 
ever eradicate high economic 
segregation 
levels 
without 

changing the fundamental role 
of the University.

Affordability

According to the study, hous-

ing costs are key factor in eco-
nomic segregation.

The study found that housing 

costs are related to educational 
and occupational segregation, 
but not strongly connected to 
income segregation.

Mellander said spatial seg-

regation — the idea that mem-
bers of a single class tend to live 
together — is probably related 
most to housing opportunities. 
She noted that often, an area’s 
affluence might not reflect the 
fact that it is very spatially seg-
regated. This, she added, is a 
serious issue.

“However, at the same time, 

we see that metros that are doing 
well economically also tend to 
be more segregated (across all 
of the studied groups) and this is 
probably one of the most impor-
tant questions to solve for the 
future, since it is the mix of dif-
ferent backgrounds and knowl-

edge that is the strength of the 
city and the foundation for new 
ideas and innovation,” she said.

Last month, Ann Arbor City 

Council adopted the Housing 
Affordability and Equity Analy-
sis, which calls for the construc-
tion of 3,139 new affordable 
homes in Ann Arbor and Pitts-
field Township by 2035. The 
resolution also calls for the con-
struction of 4,178 new middle 
class homes in Ypsilanti by the 
same deadline.

Ann Arbor Mayor Chris-

topher Taylor (D) noted that 
affordable housing is intended 
for people across a variety of 
professions, including teachers, 
secretaries, research assistants 
and outreach workers.

“We as a municipality need to 

do what we can to ensure that 
there are housing options for 
people of all income ranges,” 
Taylor said.

Councilmember Jack Eaton 

(D–Ward 4) voted against adopt-
ing the resolution, and was skep-
tical about the potential effects 
of following its guidelines, such 
as changes to the city of Ann 
Arbor’s demographics.

“You can’t really look at it in 

isolation,” Eaton said. “If we 
change the demographics of 
Ann Arbor that doesn’t mean 
that it will be to the benefit of 
Ypsilanti. It could just mean 
that we chase people out of Ann 
Arbor into other townships.”

Grimes said the role of afford-

able housing tends not to be 
taken advantage of in areas 
where most citizens have a 
bachelor’s degree, like Ann 
Arbor. He added that affordable 
housing, which is often built in 
undesirable areas, doesn’t draw 
college graduates.

However, he said Ypsilanti’s 

economic diversity could benefit 
from attracting residents with 
higher incomes.

“My hope is that housing 

in the city of Ypsilanti in par-
ticular becomes less affordable, 
because that will be a sign that 
they are attracting people with 
higher incomes,” Grimes said.

He said Washtenaw County’s 

ability to reduce economic seg-
regation depends on whether or 
not proper strategies are imple-
mented to alter job opportuni-
ties in its eastern region.

“It really sort of depends 

on whether or not the eastern 
part of the county succeeds in 
attracting high-wage, knowl-
edge-economy jobs,” he said.

I think we’re all familiar with the unspoken 

“rules” of getting around Ann Arbor:

1) If you’re driving a car, pedestrians are your 

worst enemy — they will walk in front of traffic 
without the slightest hesitation, owning the 
streets and avoiding crosswalks, “hit me, car, 
I dare you.” Also, other cars are your enemy, 
as you wait in awful traffic and arrive to your 
destination late after struggling to find parking.

2) If you’re walking around Ann Arbor, cars 

are your worst enemy. As they impatiently wait 
for you to cross an intersection, they inch closer 
and closer (nearly hitting you), congest the 
streets and produce awful exhaust fumes for 
you to breathe.

3) If you’re bicycling around Ann Arbor, 

everyone is your enemy: oblivious walkers 
swaying all over the sidewalk while they text, 
aggressive cars, poorly laid-out bike lanes, 
potholes, left turns — even the squirrels! 
Clearly, Ann Arbor’s transportation system 
needs some work.

If 
driving, 
walking 
and 
biking 
are 

unsatisfying modes of travel, the next viable 
option would be using the public transportation 
system. As we all know, the University has its 
own bus system for those commuting around 
campus, and Ann Arbor’s “TheRide” has bus 
routes to get around more destinations of the 
city. Unfortunately, this mode of transportation 
is equally unsatisfying.

I’m bitter about spending my freshman 

year on North Campus for several reasons, but 
dealing with the bus system was potentially 
the most frustrating aspect. These buses still 
have to navigate in the midst of daily Ann 
Arbor traffic, making it difficult to get around 
in a timely manner. Buses, both University 
and public, are extremely crowded (game day, 
anyone?) and difficult to navigate. Currently, 
it’s impossible for buses, walkers, bikers and 
drivers to cooperate and partake in using the 
roads in a smooth, efficient manner. Neither 
students nor Ann Arbor locals deserve this 
daily frustration. So, what can we do about this?

As a current student of an RC social 

science class, “History Goes Green,” I’ve had 
the opportunity to discover that practical, 
sustainable solutions aren’t always created 
by new, cutting edge technology. Moving into 
the future without looking into the past is 
irresponsible, because we ignore important 
ideas that have already worked well in our 
history. Many students and Ann Arbor locals 
would be surprised to hear that for over 50 
years, from about 1890 to 1930, Ann Arbor and 
surrounding communities had a successful 
streetcar and interurban railway system. 

Streetcars were electric trolleys running 
through the center of the street, and interurban 
railways were streetcar lines that extended 
from one town to another. This system provided 
low fares, frequent service, convenient stops 
and generally was extremely successful and 
favored by locals.

There are several directions to take when 

rethinking Ann Arbor’s transportation system. 
Personally, I find it most important to prioritize 
encouraging walking and biking. We like to 
think of Ann Arbor as bike friendly, but it’s 
unsettling, if not dangerous, to bike on several 
main streets, such as State Street and Packard. 
I’ve noticed bike-share stations popping up 
around campus, but further improvements need 
to be made. Bike lanes should be improved with 
tangible road barriers, and parking and driving 
over bike lanes should be restricted. Ann Arbor 
could also use bike shelters to protect bikes 
during cold weather (this would encourage 
biking year-round). Also, prohibiting motor 
vehicles in congested areas of downtown Ann 
Arbor certain times of the day and week may 
help encourage more walking in public areas, 
especially during busy times such as game days.

Another solution that may be controversial 

is installing a high-capacity transit system 
connecting Northeast Ann Arbor, downtown, 
both the North and South campuses, the 
Medical campus and commercial areas. This 
could exist in the form of a light rail system, a 
separate bus lane (bus rapid transit) or sticking 
with the past and reintroducing the streetcar. 
For those still inclined to drive, there should 
be incentives for carpooling, such as offering 
lower rates at parking garages to vehicles with 
more than three people in the car, which could 
potentially minimize the number of vehicles 
downtown. These solutions would benefit 
everyone moving around Ann Arbor: young 
professionals, students, business owners and 
Ann Arbor locals.

I understand that I can’t romanticize the 

past too much. I understand the appeal of 
having a car and the feeling of independence, 
being in control of where you go. However, 
Ann Arbor continues to grow in population and 
employment, and we need to start preparing 
for future growth. Having everyone travel 
individually by car is unsustainable, and I’d 
hate to see intimate, well known spaces in our 
town sacrificed and crowded by more parking 
structures. Re-thinking our transportation 
system gives us the opportunity to connect to 
our past and to improve our future.

elcome back, students! 
Another Spring Break 
has come and gone 

at 
the 
Univer-

sity, and I can 
only imagine the 
drunken 
antics 

that ensued. Even 
at the geriatric 
age of 35, I have a 
couple of bar tales 
from this week. 
I’ll 
spare 
you 

the details of my 
excursions, but I 
would encourage 
you all to think about alcohol, bars 
and their place in our culture.

Most people are familiar with 

the bars around campus, so I won’t 
waste time extolling the finer vir-
tues of Skeeps over Vinology, or 
why you really shouldn’t order the 
“Constant Buzz” from Dominick’s 
(regardless of the amount of “love” 
per gallon). Instead, I want to focus 
on how the bar can help your career, 
or how it can show you a more vis-
ceral side of humanity.

There is no way to oversell just 

how important alcohol is to human-
ity. Historically, taverns, pubs and 
even coffeehouses have been cen-
ters of commerce, meeting and 
civic engagement. World-renowned 
speeches have been given, standing 
armies have been formed and revo-
lutionary activities have all taken 
place in American bars. Some sci-
entists even believe that humanity 
switched from a hunter-gatherer 
lifestyle to an agricultural lifestyle 
because of our desire to brew beer.

Regardless of why civilization 

started, it’s hard to deny the impor-
tance of alcohol in today’s modern 
society. All types of business trans-
actions, large and small, still hap-
pen in bars to this day. For instance, 
in Japan, there are several rituals 
surrounding business and the con-
sumption of alcohol. There, after 
one has had a few drinks at the iza-
kaya, it is seen as socially acceptable 
to allow the barriers between boss 
and employee to melt away, giving 
Japanese employees a chance to tell 
their bosses how they truly feel.

In my adopted hometown of 

South Lyon, we have a great local 
brewery, the Witch’s Hat Brewing 
Company. At any time of the day, you 
can stop in and see a very rare sight: 
people sitting and talking to their 
neighbor about politics, sports, reli-
gion and just about every other topic 
imaginable. It’s there that I received 
an internship offer for this coming 
summer, which has eased a lot of my 
mental burden heading into my final 
year at the University. Ironically, 
it was at this pub nearly 20 miles 
north of campus where I met people 
who work at the University, whose 
work-related actions have affected 
my time on campus without me even 
realizing it (Hi Sarah!).

The resurgence of craft beer is 

wonderful for American bar cul-
ture. The “meat-market” style bars 
will always exist and are likely the 
variety with which most students 
are most familiar. Those corporate 
chains are ok, especially when you 
first start going to bars, but even-
tually the “club scene” gets old, 
even to the heartiest of dancers. 
It’s the local pub, the town water-

ing hole, where the real magic hap-
pens. That’s where you get to see 
the whole range of what life has 
to offer. Personally, I’ve witnessed 
everything from marriage propos-
als to divorce decrees, the excited 
announcement of a new child to 
the overwhelming sorrow from the 
loss of a loved one. It’s people at 
their worst, people at their best and 
everything in between. Honestly, 
it’s humans being human, and it’s a 
great thing to be a part of.

I want to challenge each one of 

you who is of legal drinking age to 
go and check out a local brewery 
or pub. Ann Arbor has quite a few 
great places to catch a local brew, 
from mega-suppliers like Ash-
ley’s to small-batch brewers like 
Blue Tractor. When you get there, 
put your phone away. Just sit and 
observe. Eventually, you’ll get an 
opportunity to chime in with a 
comment, a suggestion or even just 
an opinion about the beer you’re 
drinking. You never know, that per-
son sitting next to you may just be 
the traveling professor who influ-
ences your choice of major. They 
may offer you a job. They may just 
say the perfect thing to get you feel-
ing better about whatever is weigh-
ing heavy upon your heart.

So, next time you get that urge to 

down a few, jump out of your com-
fort zone and head to a local pub. 
And if you see me there, please don’t 
be afraid to say hello. I’ll be the guy 
chatting it up with my neighbors, 
without a phone in sight.

Animal trauma isn’t OK 
 
 

TO THE DAILY: 

I was disappointed to learn that the psy-

chologist Stephen Suomi was invited to speak 
at the University of Michigan as part of the 
Research Center for Group Dynamics Seminar 
Series. In the 1970s, Suomi got his start per-
manently removing baby monkeys from their 
mothers under the supervision of the notori-
ous Harry Harlow. With Harlow, he designed 
the “pit of despair,” a vertical metal chamber 
in which infant monkeys were confined alone 
and completely denied contact with the world 
for months on end in order to induce despon-
dency and depression. Suomi also helped 
design the “rape rack” in which mentally-ill 
female monkeys were restrained and forcibly 
impregnated.

While many of us think of maternal depri-

vation experiments as being bygone atrocities 
relegated to the pages of psychology text-
books, for more than 30 years, Stephen Suomi 

has continued to conduct these cruel experi-
ments on monkeys at a government laboratory 
in Maryland. And I’m sure he did not disclose 
to his audience the nightmarish details of his 
work that were uncovered in a recent video 
expose by PETA and criticized by experts, 
including Dr. Jane Goodall.

Given the sophisticated brain imaging 

and other modern methods we have to study 
human mental illness, it is baffling that Suomi 
would continue to pursue such antiquated and 
irrelevant experiments, and all the more baf-
fling that a figure who conducted such unethi-
cal research would be invited to speak at our 
campus. As future leaders and researchers, 
University students should instead learn from 
scientists who conduct sound research with-
out causing psychological and physiological 
trauma to animals.

Health care’s role in death row executions

On April 29, 2014 at 6:23 p.m., 

Clayton Lockett’s execution began. 
The doctor used a combination of 
drugs for lethal injection never 
before tested. At 6:33 p.m. the doctor 
announced Lockett was unconscious. 
At 6:39 p.m., Lockett said the word 
“man” and tried to get off his gurney, 
showing clear signs of movement. 
The execution was stopped because 
the drugs were not entirely injected 
into Lockett’s body and there was 
not enough left to try again. By 7:06 
p.m., Lockett was pronounced dead 
— not from the lethal injection, but 
from a heart attack. To decrease the 
unnecessarily painful aspects of the 
death sentence, as seen in Lockett’s 
execution, the U.S. government and 
courts must better utilize health care 
personnel involved with carrying out 
the inmate’s sentence.

Many 
people, 
including 
Dr. 

Sidney Wolfe argue that health care 
officials have absolutely no role in 
intentionally killing another human, 
since a core value of their profession 
is to do no harm. Although health 
care professionals believe in doing 
no harm, they must prioritize 
mitigating harm in situations where 
death is inevitable, like executions 
involving lethal injection. In order 
to 
reduce 
excessively 
painful 

aspects of the inmate’s punishment, 
health care professionals need to 
be integrated more within existing 
death row practices. The three types 
of health care personnel that need 
to be utilized are psychiatrists, to 
psychologically support death row 
inmates; pharmacists, who make 
drugs used in lethal injection; and 
physicians, who are involved in 
overseeing the actual execution.

Currently, mental health checks 

are given to inmates, but the 
court must require psychiatrists 
to 
guide 
an 
inmate 
through 

the death row phenomena. The 
phenomenon 
occurs 
when 
an 

inmate becomes mentally unstable 
due to anxiety stemming from 
solitary confinement and/or their 
impending execution.

Like Juan Mendez, a UN special 

rapporteur on torture, I consider 
solitary confinement itself a form 
of torture. Inmates on death row 
can develop depression, anger, 
hypersensitivity and paranoia, as 
well as attempt to inflict self-harm, 
as a result of solitary confinement. A 
psychiatrist’s role should consist of 
meeting with the inmate to provide 
human interaction and emotional 
support in an attempt to alleviate 
the mental suffering of inmates. By 
offering additional psychological 
care to inmates prior to death, 
the inmates will experience a less 
cruel form of torture leading up to 
 

their execution.

American-based 
pharmacies 

that manufacture drugs for lethal 
injection need to be better supported 
with testing facilities to continue 
production. 
Pharmacies 
where 

the deadly drugs are produced 
are 
creating 
different 
drug 

combinations that are unregulated 
and have minimal testing features, 
as discussed by Nadia Sawicki in The 
New England Journal of Medicine. 
By 
regulating 
and 
encouraging 

testing, pharmacies can get the drug 
mixture correct and avoid botched 
executions, as was the case for 
Lockett’s injection.

Also, 
state 
and 
federal 
governments 

can assist pharmacies by providing 
anonymity for producing the fatal 
drugs. The pharmacists can then 
spend 
adequate 
time 
preparing 

and testing drug mixtures before 
executions without fear of public 
backlash or botched lethal injections. 
By properly equipping pharmacies, 

inmates will not have to be subject 
to additional pain as a result of a 
chemically incorrect lethal drug.

Courts must ask the American 

Medical Association to mandate 
doctors, who choose to partake 
in the lethal injection process, 
adequately prepare to oversee such a 
practice. Executions are dangerously 
haphazard without proper medical 
oversight. The alternative would 
be to ask prison employees with no 
training to conduct the procedures, 
which occurs now. Therefore, in 
order to inflict the least amount of 
intentional pain during executions, 
the American Medical Association 
must prepare and train physicians 
prior to executions. The training can 
include inserting intravenous lines, 
monitoring vitals and administering 
lethal 
drugs 
in 
high-stress 

situations. If states mandate medical 
associations to provide thorough 
training for doctors who choose to 
participate in executions, physicians 
can play a valuable role in ensuring 
safe executions and decreasing cruel 
and inhumane torture of inmates.

With the death penalty already 

condemned 
by 
18th 
century 

philosopher Cesare Beccaria and 
others, measures need to be put into 
place by the government to decrease 
any additional cruel, inhumane or 
degrading treatment of inmates 
prior to and during executions. 
By better supporting health care 
officials, 
inmates 
like 
Clayton 

Lockett would not be subject to 
botched executions, suffering before 
death. The purpose of the lethal 
injection is to quickly and efficiently 
end the life of a convicted criminal, 
not to cause even more torture that 
would otherwise be avoidable with 
proper health care assistance.

A civil aviation accident investigator stands at the site of the wreckage of one of two helicopters that collided in midair in La Rioja province, Argentina Tuesday, March 10, 
2015. 
Argentina probes helicopter 
crash as France mourns dead 

Silicon Valley firm 
questions woman 
in gender bias suit

Investigators 

examine aircraft 

remains to determine 

cause of incident

VILLA CASTELLI, Argen-

tina (AP) — Investigators picked 
through the wreckage of two 
helicopters 
Tuesday, 
remov-

ing cellphones, bits of paper and 
other charred and unrecogniz-
able items, as France mourned 
the loss of prominent athletes 
in the dual crash in the Andean 
foothills.

The eight French nationals 

and two Argentine pilots on the 
two aircraft were killed when 
they collided and burst into 
flames shortly after taking off 
Monday near the remote settle-
ment of Villa Castelli in north-

western Argentina.

Among 
the 
victims 
were 

Olympic 
champion 
swimmer 

Camille Muffat, Olympic bronze-
medalist boxer Alexis Vastine 
and pioneering sailor Florence 
Arthaud. They were contes-
tants on the reality TV show 
“Dropped,” which was being shot 
in the sparsely populated region.

Expressions of grief poured 

in from French athletes and offi-
cials, including President Fran-
cois Holland, who said he felt 
“immense sadness.” The Inter-
national 
Olympic 
Committee 

announced it would fly its flag at 
half-staff for three days.

French officials said they 

would work with Argentine 
investigators to determine the 
cause of the accident.

La Rioja’s aviation director, 

Daniel Gorkich, told The Asso-
ciated Press that both pilots 

were highly trained and he 
speculated that afternoon sun 
and strong winds might have 
been a factor.

At the moment of impact “the 

sun was setting on the Andes 
mountain range directly in front 
of them. Also this is an area with 
wind gusts,” Gorkich said.

A widely circulated video 

shows the blades of one heli-
copter hitting the rails of the 
second, causing both aircraft to 
lose control and crash.

The two Eurocopters crashed 

about 50 feet (15 meters) apart 
and were destroyed. One air-
craft was so charred that only 
the blades were recognizable.

Fabrice 
Pellerin, 
Muffat’s 

former coach, fondly recalled 
the 25-year-old swimmer who 
won gold in the 400-meter 
freestyle as well as a silver and 
a bronze at the 2012 London 

Olympics. “Always smiling. She 
was a fantastic person,” he said.

Vastine’s death was a terrible 

loss, said Dominique Nato, the 
former technical director of the 
French Boxing Federation. “It 
feels like I’ve lost a member of 
my family. He was my friend, he 
was like my little brother.”

Vastine, 28, won a bronze 

medal at the 2008 Olympic 
Games in Beijing, lost in the 
quarterfinals four years later 
in London and was looking to 
compete again at the Olympics 
next year in Rio de Janeiro.

Arthaud, 57, was perhaps the 

best known, for being a pioneer 
in sailing. In 1990, she became 
the first woman to win the 
famed Route du Rhum race, a 
trans-Atlantic 
single-handed 

yacht race between Brittany 
and the Caribbean island of 
Guadeloupe.

Lawsuit highlights 

gender imbalance at 

investment companies 

in the region

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An 

attorney representing a presti-
gious Silicon Valley venture capi-
tal firm in a gender bias lawsuit 
questioned the plaintiff Tuesday 
about why she did not reject initial 
advances by a male colleague and 
showed jurors emails in which the 
co-workers appeared to exchange 
compliments and banter.

Plaintiff Ellen Pao testified that 

the colleague first approached her 
romantically during a trip to Ger-
many after she had been struck 
by a cab. She was dazed from her 
injuries and couldn’t object to his 
advances, she said.

“I got hit by cab and then he 

tried to hit on me,” Pao testified.

Pao previously testified that 

the colleague was relentless in 
pursuing her, and that she began 
an affair with him after he said 
his wife had left him. She said 
she broke it off several months 
later when she learned that was 
a lie.

Pao was questioned for the first 

time by defense attorney Lynne 
Hermle, who represents Kleiner 
Perkins Caufield & Byers. Their 
exchanges were often tense, with 
Pao staring at the lawyer and 
pausing before responding yes or 
no.

Among the emails shown to 

the jury was one from 2006, after 
the affair began, in which Pao 
wrote that she was always look-
ing out for the colleague — “never 
stopped, never will.”

In text messages that year, she 

said she didn’t think he was a bad 
person and she wasn’t mad at him 
for not being able to have a real 
relationship at the time.

After she ended the affair, Pao 

testified, the colleague retaliated 
by shutting her out of emails and 
meetings.

When she raised the retalia-

tion issue with management, a 
senior partner explained how he 
had met his wife at another com-
pany while he was married, and 
perhaps Pao could have the same 
outcome with her colleague, she 
testified.

The lawsuit has spotlighted 

gender imbalance at elite Silicon 
Valley 
investment 
companies 

that are stacked with some of the 
nation’s most accomplished grad-
uates — multiple degree holders 
from schools such as Stanford 
and Harvard who are compet-
ing aggressively to back the next 
Google or Amazon.

Women, however, are grossly 

underrepresented in the venture 
capital and technology sectors.

Pao seemed to address those 

concerns Tuesday, saying under 
questioning by her attorney that 
her lawsuit was aimed in part at 
creating equal opportunities for 
women in the venture capital sec-
tor.

“I’ve tried many times to bring 

Kleiner Perkins to the right path,” 
she told jurors. “I think there 
should be equal opportunities for 
women and men to be venture 
capitalists.”

She also told jurors that she had 

sought $10 million from the firm 
in exchange for voluntarily leav-
ing, saying she believed the figure 
would prompt the firm to change 
its treatment of women.

Pao did not receive the money 

and continued working at the 
firm. Her lawsuit seeks $16 mil-
lion in damages.

The 45-year-old Pao said the 

company repeatedly dismissed 
her attempts to open a discus-
sion about gender bias and instead 
hired an antagonistic investiga-
tor to look into her complaint.

Ambassador suggests 

language change in 

old resolution to 

include women

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — 

At a private working lunch for 
the five most powerful members 
of the United Nations Security 
Council, the conversation turned 
to the question of the next U.N. 
secretary-general.

A 
European 
ambassador 

reminded colleagues of a General 
Assembly resolution nearly as old 
as the 70-year organization itself, 
a guiding document for a selec-
tion process for U.N. chief that 
has remained secretive and 
almost completely male. The 
January 1946 resolution says 
a “man of eminence and high 
attainment” should hold the 
post.

Perhaps, 
the 
ambassador 

suggested, some might want to 
add the words “or a woman.”

No doubt. Just three female 

candidates have been included 
in past closed-door votes and 
straw polls that the Security 
Council has used to make its 
choice for decades, but now 
two campaigns are launching 
to make sure the next “Your 
excellency” is a she.

“There have been eight men 

and no women. To me, it’s 
time,” said Jean Krasno, a lec-
turer at Yale who leads the new 
Campaign to Elect a Woman 
Secretary-General.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-

moon will remain in office 
through Dec. 31, 2016, but the 
talk about his successor has 
already 
started, 
especially 

among U.N. watchers who’ve 
gone as far as scrutinizing the 
handwriting on paper ballots 
after Security Council straw 
polls. Ban’s successor is expect-
ed to be chosen late next year, 
though there is no official date.

On Sunday, the campaign 

will launch WomanSG.org to 
feature around a dozen women 

it says are outstanding possible 
candidates with political expe-
rience. Every few weeks, anoth-
er group of possible candidates 
will be posted online.

Next month, the internation-

al women’s rights group Equal-
ity Now will launch a similar 
Time for a Woman campaign 
while urging the public to 
pressure the U.N. and member 
states to make “gender a seri-
ous consideration for the first 
time,” said the group’s legal 
adviser, Antonia Kirkland.

Women that they’re pointing 

out include Helen Clark, former 
New Zealand prime minister 
and the head of the U.N. Devel-
opment 
Program; 
Bulgarian 

European commissioner Krista-
lina 
Georgieva; 
Lithuanian 

President Dalia Grybauskaite; 
Danish Prime Minister Helle 
Thorning-Schmidt, and Chilean 
President Michelle Bachelet.

“And obviously, you could 

have 
some 
sort 
of 
dream 

thoughts 
around 
(German 

Chancellor) Angela Merkel,” 
said Laura Liswood, the secre-
tary-general of the Council of 
Women World Leaders, a col-
lection of 53 current and former 
female heads of state that’s not 
part of either campaign.

Another 
name 
floating 

around is International Mon-
etary Fund managing director 
Christine Lagarde, though as 
a Frenchwoman, she is likely a 
long shot. Candidates from the 
five permanent council mem-
bers’ countries — the United 
States, Britain, France, Russia 
and China — are by tradition 
not considered.

The topic is a popular one as 

women’s organizations from 
around the world assemble at 
the U.N. for this week’s meeting 
of the Commission on the Sta-
tus of Women and side events 
featuring Hillary Rodham Clin-
ton and Melinda Gates. “More 
women are leading businesses, 
governments and global orga-
nizations. At the same time, 
progress remains unacceptably 
slow,” Ban told the meeting 

Monday.

The world currently has 

fewer than 20 female heads 
of state and government, and 
women make up about a quar-
ter of posts in the U.N. Secre-
tariat’s most senior levels. A 
female secretary-general “will 
be a cherry on top,” the head 
of the U.N. agency promoting 
equality for women, Phumzile 
Mlambo-Ngcuka, told report-
ers Friday.

The 
race 
for 
secretary-

general, just as the one for U.S 
president, is long on both time 
and speculation, as shown by 
last week’s lunch, recounted 
by a U.N. source with direct 
knowledge of the event who 
spoke on condition of anonym-
ity to discuss the private con-
versation.

Tradition says each region, 

such as Africa or Asia, gets 
its turn at having someone in 
the top post, though the U.N. 
Charter says nothing about it. 
This time would be the turn 
of eastern Europe, which has 
never had anyone in the job. 
The female head of the U.N. 
cultural 
agency, 
UNESCO 

Director-General Irina Bokova, 
is already a favorite in specu-
lation with a nomination from 
her native Bulgaria.

But along with the calls for 

a woman in charge are high-
profile demands to shake up the 
selection process for secretary-
general altogether, which could 
allow for a larger pool of female 
candidates from around the 
world.

The campaign 1 for 7 Billion, 

which launched last year with 
the support of dozens of NGOs 
like 
Amnesty 
International, 

takes up the frustrations of 
many of the 193 U.N. member 
states who say they have little 
voice in picking a secretary-
general. The Security Council, 
dominated by its five perma-
nent members and their veto 
power, essentially emerges and 
hands a single candidate to the 
General Assembly of all mem-
ber states for its approval.

As race for UN chief begins, 
campaigns demand female rep.
the Old Fourth Ward and it is one 
of the city’s first residential areas. 
Today, it is home to students, pro-
fessors and Ann Arbor natives.

LSA junior Karuna Mizusaki 

lived in Old Fourth Ward last 
semester. She said she and her 
housemates moved to the area for 
the cheaper rent and its proximity 
to Main Street.

“You really get to experience 

Ann Arbor as a city and you also 
can be a part of student life on 
South University,” Mizusaki said. 
“My friends and I always went to 
find the cool restaurants and go 
to a bunch of the little stores on 
Main Street because they were so 
close.”

While the rent prices average 

$4,400 a month for a larger-sized 
house, there are many apartments 
and houses in the area that are 
both smaller and cheaper. The 
neighborhood also houses several 
co-ops, which provide students 
cheaper housing compared to 
other available residential options 
in the area.

The blue and purple neighbor-

ing co-op houses, dubbed Michi-
gan and Minnie, provide students 
a communal living experience 
in which all residents help cook, 
clean and take care of the house.

Many students also live in the 

neighborhood for its close vicin-
ity to the many unique boutiques, 
restaurants, bars and coffee shops 
on Main Street and in Kerrytown.

Engineering senior Daniel Lao 

said he believes the neighborhood 
provides something for everyone.

“It’s really close to a variety 

of different stores, from restau-
rants to stores where you can buy 
clothing to stationary,” Lao said. 

“You can really find whatever you 
want.”

Part of the original village of 

Ann Arbor, the nearby Kerrytown 
marketplace was named after 
County Kerry, Ireland. It is home 
to the nationally renowned Zing-
erman’s Deli, as well as the city’s 
farmers market, the Ann Arbor 
Artisans’ Market, the Kerrytown 
Concert House and a plethora of 
antique stores.

Art & Design senior Grace Lud-

mer said the community is unique 
for its many artistic and musical 
opportunities.

“There are lots of local perfor-

mances or parties with live music, 
which is pretty cool,” Ludmer 
said. “South Campus doesn’t have 
as close of an artistic community.”

North Ingalls is another unof-

ficial neighborhood located north 
of Central Campus. Similar to Old 
Fourth Ward, the area is also cov-
eted for its proximity to campus, 
as well as to the same shopping 
and eating attractions. The neigh-
borhood is almost completely 
comprised of student residences.

Engineering sophomore Steve 

Nemeth said he chose to live in 
the area because of its good repu-
tation, decent prices and housing 
availability. However, he said the 
five to 10 minute walk to campus is 
sometimes difficult in the winter.

Depending on where in the 

neighborhood students reside, the 
area is also predominantly known 
for its proximity to the Medical 
School campus. The North Ingalls 
neighborhood is convenient for 
students going to the University 
hospitals, science buildings or the 
Nursing School.

“Here on the Huron side, we 

really have it all: a three min-
ute walk to class, four minutes 
to State Street and five minutes 
to the CCRB,” LSA junior Caron 

Lindsay wrote in an e-mail inter-
view. “I brought my car originally 
to campus, but I’ve found I don’t 
even need it for groceries since 
there are AATA and BlueBus 
stops all around.”

Lindsay also said she felt the 

neighborhood is both safe and 
affordable.

“This area just seems to encom-

pass everything I need, while still 
providing affordable rent and 
convenience,” Lindsay wrote.

Both Old Fourth Ward and 

North Ingalls come with their 
drawbacks as well. Though nei-
ther have many safety concerns, 
Old Fourth Ward is a popular 
location for noise complaints, 
according to the Crime Watcher 
app powered by the Ann Arbor 
Police Department.

Because of North Ingalls’ prox-

imity the hospitals, sirens some-
times disturb students living in 
the area.

“Noise pollution from cars, 

trucks and pedestrian traffic 
sometimes bleed through and 
cause issues while studying or 
sleeping,” Lindsay said.

While the area houses many 

members of the University com-
munity, Mizusaki said she would 
prefer if more undergraduate 
students lived in the neighbor-
hood. The northern region of Old 
Fourth Ward is also heavily pop-
ulated with Ann Arbor perma-
nent residents and families with 
children attending local public 
schools.

“We have tons of medical, nurs-

ing, dental and research students 
as our neighbors because of our 
close proximity to Rackham and 
the respective graduate schools,” 
Lindsay said. “But there are defi-
nitely the undergrads around, and 
they know how to have a good 
time in a great neighborhood.”

NEIGHBORHOODS
From Page 1A

as well as the addition of new off-
campus lighting was introduced 
during the CSG meeting.

The Hill, Oxford and Geddes 

areas were selected as the main 
locations of concern. CSG Vice 
President Emily Lustig, an LSA 
senior, said the locations were 
chosen based on safety walks, sur-

veying students and speaking with 
different safety administrations.

Student 
Sexual 
Misconduct 

Policy

CSG considered a resolution 

calling for the support of the 
inclusion of the University’s Stu-
dent Sexual Misconduct Policy on 
course syllabi.

The goal of the proposal is to 

combat sexual misconduct on 
campus by making the policy more 
readily available to students. The 

resolution cannot require profes-
sors to include the policy in their 
syllabi, but rather recommends 
the language be included.

Before Spring Break, both the 

LSA Student Government and the 
Engineering Student Government 
passed resolutions supporting the 
initiative.

All 
three 
proposals 
were 

referred to the resolutions com-
mittee and will be voted on during 
the next CSG meeting.

Weak plot leaves 
film out of ‘Focus’ 

New Will Smith film 

is beautiful, but a 

cheap crowd pleaser

By LAUREN WOOD

For The Daily

“Focus” ends the way it 

begins: 
with 
stylish 
shots, 

smooth, jazzy music and Will 
Smith at the 
center of his 
carefully 
crafted world. 
However, 
in 

the two hours 
from 
the 

film’s start to 
close, “Focus,” 
although 
forced 
and 

predictable at times, plays with 
the viewers expectations in a 
unique and engaging way.

The smooth cinematography, 

cliched dialogue and drawn-out 
pace makes certain scenes of 
“Focus” seem like a floundering 
attempt at romantic comedy. 
However, the film actually 
succeeds in using these tools 
to manipulate its audience into 
the dynamic of deceiver versus 
deceived. Nick (Will Smith, “I 
Am Legend”) is a high-level con-
man who Jess (Margot Robbie, 
“The Wolf of Wall Street”), 
an amateur thief, attempts to 
scam one evening at a hotel 
restaurant. After failing, she 
begs him to help her improve as 
a con, and the two begin a long, 
twisted relationship through 
the 
hidden 
and 
deceptive 

world of professional fraud. 
Although the story is drawn-
out and winding, it’s cheaply 
satisfying to watch the two 
work through schemes as small 
as pickpocketing on a busy 
New Orleans street to priming 
billionaire gamblers to place 
predictable bets.

The 
interactions 
between 

Nick and Jess often appear 
forced, and where another movie 
would cut the scene and spare 
its audience the more mediocre 
moments 
of 
conversation, 

“Focus” chooses to keep the 
camera rolling, gambling its 
viewers’ attention and respect 
for 
the 
hopefully 
lucrative 

payout when the characters’ 
shocking true intentions are 
revealed. For as many failed 

and unbelievable moments the 
movie has, there are an equal 
number of plot twists that 
play off these disingenuous 
interactions, validating their 
place within the film.

However, 
no 
number 
of 

clever loopholes and narrative 
backpedaling can make the 
superstar personas of Smith 
and 
Robbie 
relatable 
or 

believable. The script works in 
Smith’s favor, giving him more 
than enough of the vague, yet 
affirmative 
monologues 
he 

excels at. Despite this, his acting 
is difficult to read emotionally, 
and, by the film’s end, it’s still 
unclear what his character’s 
true intentions are. (Though 
maybe this is fitting within the 
deceptive theme of the story.)

FILM REVIEW
Similarly, Robbie’s role seems 
perfectly written for her, and 
she easily inserts herself into 
the typical cool girl archetype, 
laughing at everyone’s jokes, 
shocking them with her small 
instances of cleverness and 
remaining celestially gorgeous 
all the while. The two seem 
to play to what is expected of 
them as major Hollywood stars 
instead of playing the actual 
characters, and this takes the 
film one step further away from 
realism or plausibility.

The 
overall 
composition 

is strangely professional and 
detached, 
which 
makes 
it 

difficult to engage with the story 
or characters until the actual 
plot becomes dynamic. There’s 
no transition between scenes, 
and those smash cuts paired with 
the long, unmotivated dialogues 
between Smith and Robbie make 
the film feel more like a writing 
exercise than a final product. 
There’s a generic, hotel lobby 
jazz playing in the back of most 
of the scenes, and while this feels 
like a bad example of big-budget 
filmmaking in the beginning, as 
the story of deception continues 
the stylistic predictability begins 
to seem intentional and gives the 
impression that the film itself is 

one of the high-powered schemes 
Nick and Jess pull off with ease.

There are multiple moments 

where 
it 
seems 
like 
the 

conman-story-with-a-twist 
plot has been pushed too far, 
and the romantic acting and 
high-risk stakes have become 
entirely unbelievable. However, 
where “Focus” succeeds is its 
ability to continually reflect 
on its weaknesses, usurping 
previously 
unbelievable 

moments 
with 
grand 

explanations 
of 
conniving 

deception, 
providing 
its 

audience with a cheap but 
entertaining thrill ride.

CHECK OUT WHAT’S 

NEW ON

didn’t because the “Friends” 
pilot wasn’t until 1994. And so, 
instead, we’ll save these loaded 
thinkers for David Gelb’s debut 
feature, “The Lazarus Effect”: 
2015’s heretofore worst film 
that could have been just plain 
worse.

Gelb, a New York native, 

earned a bronze award in 
a 
NYC-wide 
Shakespeare 

monologue 
competition 
at 

some point before his brief, 
doc-driven filmography took 
off. His 2011 “Jiro Dreams of 
Sushi” documents an 85-year-
old sushi master and the film 
was nabbed for Tribeca Film 
Fest alongside critical acclaim. 
But, as someone wiser than me 
once lectured, the fun is forever 
ephemeral. In “The Lazarus 
Effect,” Gelb forays into a 
tenuous subgenre of horror — 
the kind powered along only by 
unlit cheap scares and kick-me-
in-the-face romantic passes. 
And Olivia Wilde in a bra ticks 
before she goes all animorph-
eyes and starts hurting her 
friends. It shocks me that Gelb, 
someone who must know what 
humanity looks like based on 
his “Sushi” run, could hire a 
couple writers who are inspired 
only by the fact that they’re still 
afraid of the dark.

The film centers — no, hovers 

without gravity — on a group 
of medical researchers granted 
big bucks by their university to 
perfect a serum that prolongs the 
time doctors have to study people 
in comas. “It’s about giving 
everyone a second chance,” as 
Frank (Mark Duplass, “The One 
I Love”), the lead on the project, 
puts it. The research changes 
course after the unlikely revival 
of a dead dog, dialing the film’s 
temperature up to a moral 
and metaphysical fever pitch. 
Fair enough, but only until the 
university admin, who’s in bed 
with Big Pharma and well aware 

of Frank and his team’s recent 
discoveries, decides to pull their 
funding and supplant their lab 
with wonkish suits.

Livid with the stipulation-

whore university, Frank and his 
team, made up of Zoe (Olivia 
Wilde, “Drinking Buddies”), two 
quirky jokesters (Donald Glover, 
TV’s “Community,” and Evan 
Peters, TV’s “American Horror 
Story”) and a student intern 
(Sarah Bolger, “Crush”), break 
into the premises to finish what 
could be some earth-shattering 
shit.

Until something goes, like, 

wrong.

The rest of the movie is less 

a movie and more an attention 
grabber Gelb puts on a set, 
injecting narrative trivialities 
just so we can (hopefully) forget 
about how trivial the movie 
is in total. You know you’re in 
trouble when 50 percent of your 
shots 
use 
surveillance-cam 

grain and you aren’t aware of 
your campiness. A “Paranormal 
Activity” movie knows what it is. 
“Lazarus,” through its surface-
level dialogue on life and religion 
and DMT, gets mired in its self-
seriousness. Life is too short 
to be serious — unless you’re 
“Boyhood.”

In the third act, Wilde’s 

character, 
revived 
through 

questionable means after an 
unexplained 
accident, 
can 

suddenly use 100 percent of 
her brain’s capacity. She, with 
a sinister grin, hears others’ 
conversations play out ahead 
of time, and it’s kind of cool. 
It’s a mini tragedy we had to 
watch Wilde fang instead of 
smile, see Duplass play doc 
instead of dude and, in the end, 
sit through a film that never 
succeeds in using its potential 
for supernatural-spiked editing 
to make it into “watchable” 
territory. And, with that, we’ll 
once more peg it the worst.

‘Kimmy Schmidt’ is 
optimistic, complex

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writer

“Smash Cut: A Memoir of 

Howard & Art & the ‘70s & the 
‘80s” by Brad Gooch, professor 
of English at 
William Pater-
son University 
and author of 
the acclaimed 
biography 
“City 
Poet: 

the Life and 
Times of Frank 
O’Hara,” is an inside story of 
the art world and gay commu-
nity of 1970s and ’80s New York 
City. It revolves around Gooch’s 
long-term 
relationship 
with 

filmmaker Howard Brookner 
(“Burroughs: The Movie, Rob-
ert Wilson and the Civil Wars, 
Bloodhounds 
of 
Broadway”) 

and the latter’s death by AIDS 
in 1989.

“Smash cut” is a term in 

film that refers to an abrupt 
transition between shots – an 
apt description for the narrative 
logic of a memoir that traverses 
such an incredible amount of 
historical and cultural distance. 
The drama, joy and heartbreak 
of 
Brad 
and 
Howard’s 

relationship 
unfolds 
against 

a cultural moment of such 
extremity that Gooch adopts 
and adapts Dickens’s words 
from “A Tale of Two Cities:” “It 
was the angriest of times.”

“Smash Cut” happens against 

a backdrop of appearances by 
cultural luminaries like Andy 
Warhol, Madonna and William 
S. Burroughs. It describes gay 
(sub)culture with a personal 
and 
anthropological 
touch, 

including stories about drag 
parties among Brad and How-
ard’s circle of friends and 
Gooch’s stint as a porn review-
er. He relays his time as a model 
rubbing shoulders with a glam-
orous European elite in Paris 
and Milan, living what he refers 
to as a “Paris fairytale.”

However, the aching lover’s 

discourse that is “Smash Cut” 
is not a nostalgic triumph song 
of the glamor of Gooch’s cul-
tural moment. Devoting its 
last quarter to Howard’s diag-
nosis with and death by HIV/
AIDS, “Smash Cut” is the only 
term that suffices to describe 
the emotional hemorrhage of 
the narrative movement from 
modeling gigs and encounters 
with Parisian aristocrats to the 
unimaginably 
unglamorous 

horror of the disease.

Gooch, Brookner and many 

others from the gay community 
were pulled in many directions 
by 
contradictory 
historical 

forces with the emergence of 
the 
AIDS 
epidemic. 
Gooch 

describes how the way that 
AIDS ravaged the gay commu-
nity propelled many people he 
knew personally into histori-

cal and political significance, 
describing writer and LGBTQ 
activist Larry Kramer’s trans-
formation from “one of us, a gay 
novelist,” into a “living mega-
phone by the forces of history.”

However, 
Gooch 
speaks 

frankly about his response and 
lack of activist energy at the 
beginning of the AIDS epidem-
ic and the emergence of Aids 
Coalition to Unleash Power 
(ACT UP) in 1987.

“I never attended an ACT 

UP meeting during the Howard 
years. I avoided that important 
stress point, and in retrospect 
felt diminished,” Gooch says. 
He continues, “I felt as if I had 
only enough emotional space to 
care for Howard.”

Gooch’s memoir is a testa-

ment to the uneasy intersection 
of the personal and the histori-
cal. It does not attempt to relieve 
the conflict and tension between 
the glamour, beauty, suffering, 
mourning and fury of his rela-
tionship with Howard Brookner 
over more than a decade. How-
ard himself said in a note he had 
his caregiver tape to the fridge, 
far gone into his decline in 
health: “There’s so much beauty 
in the world. That’s what got 
me in trouble in the first place.” 
Brad Gooch’s “Smash Cut” is a 
beautifully written account that 
succeeds in adequately describ-
ing such a multidimensional, 
dramatic history.

For the Daily

There’s something to be said 

for general admission concerts. 
In fact, I would say that these 
wonderfully 
sweaty, 
dark, 

drunken messes are my favor-
ite ways to experience music. 
Think about it: how many times 
are you surrounded by hun-
dreds of strangers, way too up 
in your grill, gathered together 
for the sole purpose of listen-
ing to songs that in some way or 
another move you?

Besides 
the 
fact 
that 

general 
admission 
concerts 

are usually cheaper than acts 
that can singlehandedly sell 
out enormous stadiums, they 
are also home to extremely 
dedicated 
concertgoers. 
My 

friend and I waited at least three 
hours on an unusually cold May 
afternoon to watch The 1975 
perform. Since it was a general 
admission concert, the only way 
to get remotely close to Matty 
Healy was to queue around the 
block with a couple hundred of 
my new best friends. There I 
was, dressed in a pair of mom 
jeans and Keds, surrounded by 
people who looked and dressed 
nothing like me — yet we were 
all gathered for the same, sole 
purpose of watching four dudes 

sing a few songs and get drunk 
onstage. It was glorious.

I am now Facebook friends 

with the girls who sat beside 
us in line for those few agoniz-
ing hours, and I like to think 
we’re still bonded over the 
experience. Now, compared to 
One Direction’s stadium tour 
which, yes, I did attend, the 
results are markedly different. I 
rolled up to Ford Field less than 
a half hour before showtime, 
sat in my assigned seat that I 
did not have to battle hoards 
of people to get, and watched 
Harry Styles bounce around 
on stage through my binocu-
lars. Don’t get me wrong, both 
concerts were absolutely great, 
but I didn’t come away from 
One Direction with the same 
oh my God the universe is so vast 
and I am so small but now I feel 
like I understand the meaning 
of human solidarity feeling that 
I had when driving home from 
The 1975. (Don’t lie, we’ve all 
been there.)

I’m not sure if it’s the fact 

that stadium concerts run more 
like scripted shows than raw 
contact with music now, but 
between the lightshows and 
smoke and rising platforms, 
the songs themselves seem to 
get lost in the screams of the 
crowd. While I still appreciate 

these larger venues and will 
continue to spend an inordi-
nate amount of money on tick-
ets, there is something special 
about sharing a band or musi-
cian with 1,000 people rather 
than 65,000. The connection 
between the artist and the audi-
ence in these more intimate set-
tings is tangible and electric in 
the air, resulting in an up-close 
and personal sensation you just 
don’t get in massive, sold-out 
arenas.

I haven’t been to a concert in 

a while and the itch to subject 
myself to a potentially angry 
audience yelling at me for inch-
ing towards the stage is creeping 
back. It’s a unique feeling, being 
encompassed by people who you 
will probably never see again, 
but who are all singing the same 
lyrics for different reasons than 
yourself. It also feels vaguely 
like you’re going to pass out, but 
I like to attribute that to emotion 
rather than overheating.

Regardless of what concert 

experience you have, it’s difficult 
to deny the remarkable impact 
live music, and music in general, 
has on a group of people. Genres 
ranging from pop to rap to coun-
try leave each listener with their 
own interpretation and reaction, 
and isn’t that what truly makes 
all music universal?

DIRTY HIT

1976 was cooler. 

Netflix’s first sitcom 
deftly juggles satire 
and feel-good comedy

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

“Life beats you up. You can 

either curl up in a ball and die, 
or you can stand up and say 
we’re differ-
ent. 
We’re 

the 
strong 

ones, 
and 

you 
can’t 

break us!”

Like 
the 

series’ 
title 

suggests, 
Kimmy 
Schmidt 
(Ellie Kem-
per, “The Office”) is unbreak-
able. Fifteen years ago, she and 
four other young women were 
kidnapped by a pathological 
reverend, who told them the 
world was going to end and 
their only hope of survival was 
to hide with him in an under-
ground bunker. When Kimmy 
and her fellow survivors are 
eventually rescued, the media 
brands them as the “Indiana 
Mole Women,” appropriating 
and depersonalizing their hor-
rifying experience into a viral 
video and series of news stories. 
Kimmy moves to New York, but 
her sweet naivety results in a 
stolen backpack and thousands 
of dollars in cash — which she 
received from the group’s relief 
fund — gone. A precocious 
14-year-old in an adult’s body, 
Kimmy hasn’t experienced the 
outside world in over a decade, 
and real life is a lot crueler than 
she imagined.

But Kimmy doesn’t let this 

break her and, more impressive-
ly, the heavy backstory doesn’t 
cast a shadow over “Kimmy 
Schmidt” ’s persistent sunni-
ness. The series is refreshingly 

optimistic. Kimmy is eager to 
put her traumatic past behind 
her, and the show follows suit, 
following the heroine through 
her adjustment to her new 
job, friends and love interests. 
Despite its offbeat and dark 
premise, 
“Kimmy 
Schmidt” 

plays a lot like any regular sit-
com. Kemper makes a vivacious 
and compelling lead, and the 
supporting cast is filled with 
characters that appear singu-
larly unrelatable and bizarre, 
but whose experiences and 
resilient 
personalities 
echo 

Kimmy’s.

“Kimmy Schmidt” is Netflix’s 

first venture into an original 
sitcom series, and this binge-
friendly format allows the show 
to find its groove so quickly. 
With many network comedies, 
viewers suffer through a few 
rougher weeks until the char-
acters are fully-formed and the 
comedic style is solidified. In 
“Kimmy Schmidt,” these expo-
sition-heavy early episodes play 
out like the beginning of movie, 
introducing all the important 
characters and plot elements 
as premise for a hilarious and 
incisive run of mid-season epi-
sodes. The difficulties that the 
show faces in its first few epi-
sodes — its shallow character-
ization, clumsy introduction of 
plot information and off-kilter 
humor that viewers unfamiliar 
with executive producers Tina 
Fey and Robert Carlock’s pre-
vious work on “30 Rock” may 
find off-putting — are resolved 
by episode four.

Fey and Carlock’s influ-

ence is apparent in nearly 
every aspect of the show, from 
its acerbic humor to its jazzy 
musical interludes composed 
by Fey’s husband, who also 
composed similar transitions 
for “30 Rock”. Fellow alumnus 
Jane Krakowski plays Kimmy’s 
ridiculously rich, ridiculously 
posh boss, Jacqueline Voorhees. 
At first, Jacqueline appears a 
minor permutation from Jenna 
Maroney. However, once the 
show commits to exploring 
her depth, she becomes one 
of the best characters. Voor-
hees is wealthy and wasteful, 
but those material possessions 
merely reflect an “outside-in” 
approach to self-worth — dress-
ing yourself up in diamonds 
and Botox hides the doubt and 
paranoia lurking under the 

skin. Krakowski’s manic energy 
equally matches Kemper’s, and 
the moments they share are 
some of the show’s best.

Kimmy’s roommate, aspiring 

thespian Titus Andromedon, 
steals every scene that Kra-
kowski doesn’t already. Fellow 
“30 Rock”-er Tituss Burgess is 
probably the only person in the 
universe that could pull off a shirt 
that says “Baby Slut” and sing 
“Dreamgirls” lyrics in an every-
day conversation. But aside from 
his more lighthearted moments, 
“Kimmy Schmidt” uses Titus to 
employ biting social commen-
tary and ground the show in a 
complicated racial and cultural 
landscape. For his job at a horror-
themed restaurant, Titus, who is 
African American, dresses up as 
a werewolf and quickly discovers 
that other New Yorkers treat him 
much better when he’s dressed 
in the costume of an actual mon-
ster than as a regular Black man. 
It’s a powerful statement about 
the struggles and prejudices that 
people of color have to face, but 
“Kimmy Schmidt” doesn’t dwell 
too much here. It introduces 
these serious topics and then 
moves on into comedic territory, 
just like Kimmy herself doesn’t 
focus too much on her tragic 
experiences.

“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” 

is an insightful and well-crafted 
narrative, and just as importantly, 
one of the funniest series around. 
The show’s ability to juggle satire 
and fluffy, feel-good buddy com-
edy is remarkably solid for a series 
so early in its run. Part of the suc-
cess has to be due to the magic 
touch of Tina Fey and Robert Car-
lock, but the real gem of “Kimmy 
Schmidt” is Kimmy’s relentless 
spirit. The pathos-driven comedy 
would be nowhere without that 
wide smile, that unquenchable 
enthusiasm, that magnetic effect 
that pulls the entire show into per-
fect place. She’s the strong one, and 
nothing can break her.

Fisch dividing reps 
between three QBs

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

New Michigan passing game 

coordinator 
Jedd 
Fisch 
has 

what he wants in a starting 
quarterback on his roster. It just 
isn’t all in the same person yet.

Tuesday, after the Wolverines’ 

fourth spring practice, Fisch 
shed light on what he’s looking 
for from his signal callers, but 
acknowledged it was still too 
early to give anyone an advantage.

“They have different skill 

sets,” 
Fisch 
said. 
“(Redshirt 

freshman Wilton Speight) is a 
very large man, he’s a big guy, 
and he can see everything. He’s 
a pretty good athlete and throws 
the ball well, but he doesn’t seem 
to have a ton of experience.

“(Junior Shane Morris) has a 

very strong arm, which everybody 
knows. He spins it well — he just 
needs to understand that that’s 
not really the most important 
thing. If you have a really strong 
arm, you have a really strong arm. 
That’s what you have. So now it’s 
a matter of what do you do with 
it? How do you utilize it?”

That has been the question 

for 
Morris, 
who 
looked 

uncomfortable in the pocket 
during 
limited 
action 
last 

season and overthrew multiple 
receivers. 
Freshman 
Alex 

Malzone, by contrast, seems to 
have struck the right chord with 
Fisch in terms of composure and 
the mental aspects of the game.

“Alex should be a senior in high 

school right now,” Fisch said. 
“He’s got a lot going on, and he 
has handled it unbelievably well. 
He’s unbelievable in his ability to 
not let things bother him, to be 
consistent, to jump right back and 
play the game. If a play doesn’t go 

right, he’s right back in and ready 
for the next one.”

Referencing the improvement 

of Blake Bortles — Fisch’s rookie 
quarterback last season with 
the Jacksonville Jaguars who 
drastically cut his turnovers 
the second half of the year — 
the 
new 
coach 
highlighted 

relentless competition and good 
decision-making as the factors 
most important to winning the 
starting job.

Some of the tools Fisch seems 

to be searching for in his starter 
can be seen in each of the three, 
but he’s waiting for it to come 
in one single package. And that, 
Fisch said, is what the Wolverines 
will be striving to cultivate.

“It would be great if one of 

them (separated himself), you 
always look for that,” Fisch said. 

“(But) to separate themselves, it’s 
not just one thing, it’s the whole 
game.”

Regardless of which player 

lines up under center in the fall, 
Fisch was excited about the 
talent his quarterback will be 
throwing to. Tuesday was the 
first time Fisch worked with 
redshirt junior Amara Darboh, 
and he said he was excited about 
what he saw from him as well.

Fisch wants separation at 

receiver, and he needs it at 
quarterback, but he wants it to be 
earned.

“I’ve told those guys, I think 

Mark Cuban said, ‘Work every 
day like there’s someone trying 
to take your job 24 hours a day,’ ” 
Fisch said. “If they work that hard, 
I think the talent level is plenty 
good.”

Jedd Fisch has seen strong suits in each of his three quarterbacks this spring.

Ten, 

15-15 overall) opens the Big Ten 
Tournament on Thursday at noon 
against Illinois. As long as the 
Wolverines advance, they could 
play Friday at noon, Saturday at 1 
p.m. and Sunday at 3:30 p.m.

The deck is certainly stacked 

against them in each of those 
extra games, but they’re ready.

“No 
concern,” 
Beilein 

said. “Zak (Irvin) and Spike 
(Albrecht, 
Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman) and Aubrey 
(Dawkins) did almost nothing 
for two days.”

To prepare, the team had a 

“very short” workout Sunday 
and another short workout with 
just the young players Monday. 
Beilein said they would go two 
hours Tuesday and another hour 
Wednesday before they leave for 
Chicago.

Then, the Wolverines will be 

all in — because there might not 
be anything after that.

“I’m preparing to log a lot 

of minutes, but that’s alright,” 
Albrecht said. “If we keep winning, 
I’m not going to complain. I’ll play 
as many minutes as I have to. Just 
make sure I get some sleep and eat 

well.”

Michigan’s lone senior, Max 

Bielfeldt, has the same outlook.

“I think there’s a little bit of 

that,” Bielfeldt said. “It’s not like 
I wouldn’t go in there and give it 
my all anyway, but with it being 
potentially your last Big Ten 
Tournament, it’s going to be a 
little extra meaningful.”

The 
Wolverines 
will 
still 

be an underdog in likely every 
game, beginning with No. 8 
seed Illinois. They haven’t won 
consecutive games since Jan. 17 
and Jan. 20 against Northwestern 
and Rutgers, respectively, and 
haven’t won four straight since 
the first four games of the season: 
Hillsdale, Bucknell, Detroit and 
Oregon.

That 
streak 
would 
be 

incomparably harder to replicate 
over four days against superior 
opponents, but it won’t catch 
Michigan off guard.

“We’re going for the whole deal 

right now,” Beilein said. “In our 
situation right now, that’s the only 
game left. I don’t think we’re in a 
capacity where we can rest people 
thinking, ‘We gotta get ready for 
Wisconsin.’ Maybe if you’re up by 
20 with five minutes to go, then 
it’s a little bit different.”

Then, 
after 
the 
season 

Michigan has had, he revised 
that statement.

“Maybe if you’re up by 40 

with five minutes to go, it might 
be a little different,” Beilein said. 
“Then we can get rest. But I don’t 
expect that to happen.”

INBOUNDING ISSUES: The 

last time Michigan played Illinois 
on Feb. 12, the Wolverines had a 
late lead in Champaign before 
giving it up, due in large part to 
problems with inbounds passing 
during the final minute.

Youth and personnel forced 

Albrecht, not a big man, to throw 
the ball in against Illinois center 
Nnanna Egwu. The Illini forced 
a few late turnovers, sent the 
game into overtime and ended 
up handing the Wolverines their 
third straight overtime loss.

“We’ve 
been 
working 
on 

(inbounds passing) a lot,” Beilein 
said. “The whole idea is, it’s not 
just the inbounder. Now four 
guys have to learn new positions. 
You can’t just have one out-of-
bounds (play) — you have to have 
four or five.”

Michigan is still having trouble 

finding an inbounds passer. Irvin 
is the best target for the pass, and 
Albrecht is the best at working 
out of trap defenses. Sophomore 
Sean Lonergan throws the best 
baseball pass, but his limited 
minutes make bringing him cold 
off the bench in the last minute a 
big risk.

“To say we have it fixed?” 

Beilein said. “You don’t have 
it fixed until you really have 
multiple inbounders who can 
really pass and experienced 
players that can do a whole lot of 
things.”

WALTON 
STILL 

DOUBTFUL: The earlier hopes 
of sophomore guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. returning at some 
point this season are fading by 
the day.

Walton has not practiced 

in the days since the Rutgers 
game Saturday. Though he will 
continue to try working out at 
practice, the idea of him going 
full-out in a game Thursday 
seems all but impossible.

“We’ll try him again,” Beilein 

said. “We try him almost every 
day, just to do something — jog up 
and down the court, or do some 
layups. How’s it feel? That’s about 
it.”

Michigan offense 
revving its engine

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer 

When starting a car on a cold 

Michigan winter morning, it 
takes time for it to warm up.

It has been a similar story for 

the Michigan baseball team’s 
offense, 
particularly 
with 

runners on base.

In the first seven games of the 

2015 season, the Wolverines (10-
6) compiled a 2-5 record, scoring 
29 runs on 65 hits. Michigan left 
47 men on base in its four games 
in Savannah, Georgia alone.

That all changed, though, 

during the Wolverines’ nine-
game 
Spring 
Break 
trip. 

Michigan put up 72 runs on 
99 hits, recording a .344 team 
batting average. Not surprisingly, 
the increased plate production 
showed up in Michigan’s win 
column. The Wolverines won the 
first eight contests of the nine-
game slate before ultimately 
falling to Akron, 2-0, in the final 
match.

“When 
guys 
are 
having 

quality at-bats and executing 
the approach, it’s tough for an 
opposing team to get through 
our lineup,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich.

The two games on March 

7 against Toledo and Coastal 
Carolina were Michigan’s most 
productive. 
The 
Wolverines 

scored 29 runs on 32 hits. In the 
contest with the Chanticleers, 
eight 
of 
Michigan’s 
starting 

nine recorded a hit. The team 
was especially productive in the 
clutch as the Wolverines at one 
point scored 13 consecutive runs 
in two-out situations.

“I do like the weapons that 

we have in the lineup,” Bakich 
said. “When we’re firing on all 
cylinders offensively and have 
guys who can run, steal and hit 
for power, we’re a very dangerous 
offense.”

Sophomore 
left 
fielder 

Carmen Benedetti was perhaps 
Michigan’s most impressive hitter 
in the March 7 doubleheader. He 
combined for 10 RBI — six of 

them against the Rockets — on 
six hits in the two games. His 
six RBI in the Toledo game were 
the most by any Wolverine since 
Coley Crank had seven in 2010.

“It was cool to play such a 

big role in that spot,” Benedetti 
said. “Following the coaches’ 
approach ... the plan that they 
have is working really well for all 
of (the team).”

Benedetti’s 
performance 

capped a streak of four multi-hit 
games, which included a three-
RBI showing against Siena on 
March 1. He finished the road 
trip with a .424 batting average, 
five doubles and 14 RBI.

Benedetti 
was 
not 
alone, 

though. Junior first baseman 
Jacob 
Cronenworth 
reached 

base 10 times in the March 7 
twin bill and scored eight of the 
Wolverines’ 29 runs. He also hit 
a three-run homer in the UMBC 
game March 6. His 2015 on-base 
percentage now stands at .434, 
and he’s hitting .328.

“I have to bring my game every 

day,” Cronenworth said. “When I 
play well, guys feed off my success 
and it helps the team a lot.”

Junior 
shortstop 
Travis 

Maezes, who was injured for 
most of the season’s first two 
weeks, also made significant 
contributions 
to 
Michigan’s 

effort. He started with a three-
run home run against Siena on 
Feb. 27 and later combined for 
five RBI on four hits against 
Toledo and Coastal Carolina. 
His batting average now sits 
at .306 with a .419 on-base 
percentage.

The Wolverines now boast a 

.301 team batting average, which 
is the highest in the Big Ten. 
Michigan will have to keep up 
the production while minimizing 
the number of runners left on 
base to stay in competition for 
the Big Ten Championship and, 
ultimately, a spot in the NCAA 
Tournament.

“I think we showed what our 

offense is capable of,” Bakich 
said. “There is good balance in 
the lineup.”

NOTEBOOK

BASEBALL
First-round bye key for tourney hopes

Wolverines can seal 
regular-season title 

this weekend vs. 
Michigan State

By ERIN LENNON

Daily Sports Editor

It’s almost baffling to think 

that 
the 
Michigan 
hockey 

team — a team that has been 
startlingly 
inconsistent 
all 

season — could win the Big 
Ten outright. And yet, if the 
Wolverines can pull off a sweep 
in a home-and-home series 
against Michigan State, they’ll 
be 
crowned 
regular-season 

champions.

But Michigan would sleep 

a little more easily this week 
if, as the regular-season Big 
Ten champion, it also earned 
an automatic bid to the NCAA 
Tournament.

If that were the case, the 

19th-ranked Wolverines’ playoff 
hopes heading into the final 
weekend of the regular season 
wouldn’t seem so fleeting.

“We’ve been a first-place 

team and a playoff winner at 
the same time, which in theory 
should happen,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “If you’re 
the best team through the 
season, and you’re the first-
place team in the playoffs, you 
would’ve gotten in anyway, 
because you’re a first-place 
team.”

With 
an 
11-7 
conference 

record, Michigan is tied with 
Minnesota with 33 points and 
sits only one point behind the 
Spartans.

Still, a Big Ten banner won’t 

be as impressive this year as 
it was last season. When the 
conference begins to look like 
other power leagues, as teams 
like Penn State and Michigan 
State become contenders season 
after season, four games over 
.500 may be admirable.

This year, though, a banner 

will be a testament to the 
overall weakness of the six-
team league.

By this time last season, 

both Minnesota and Wisconsin 

had all but secured at-large 
bids the NCAA Tournament, 
while 
Michigan 
was 
well 

positioned to do the same. Had 
Michigan beaten Penn State in 
the first round of the Big Ten 
Tournament, it’s likely three 
teams, if not four, would have 
made it in.

This year, there’s a similar 

chance that the conference 
won’t 
have 

any 
at-large 

bids 
at 
all. 

Ranked 
No. 

15 
entering 

its 
season 

finale 
at 

home against 
Penn 
State, 

Minnesota — 
the only other 
Big Ten team 
beside Michigan to crack the 
top 20 — also finds itself on 
the bubble. And last season’s 
runner-up, Wisconsin, has been 
a lost cause since opening the 
season 0-8.

Worth 
more 
than 
just 

bragging rights in a notably 
weak conference, a Big Ten title 
is essential for the Wolverines’ 
tournament hopes because it 
means a first-round bye.

“That’s the way it should be, 

really,” Berenson said. “That’s 
the bulk of our season, and 
we’ve always said that since 
the CCHA. How we do in the 
conference will determine our 
NCAA destiny.

“It’s exactly the same thing 

here. We’re down to the most 
important games of the year, 
which 
is 
good. 
We’ve 
got 

something to 
play for, which 
is good, and I 
think we have 
a team that 
wants to prove 
something, 
which 
is 

good.”

And for a 

team that has 
struggled 
to 

win away from Yost Ice Arena, 
that means everything.

“I think everyone knows 

the 
circumstances,” 
said 

junior forward Andrew Copp. 
“Everyone 
knows 
what 
we 

need to do this weekend, so 
there’s nothing really to add. … 
Everyone can obviously step up 
their game, and everyone needs 
to step up this weekend.

“It’s going to dictate how our 

year is looked at, basically.”

The Wolverines have lost 

their last five road games and 
were swept twice in hostile 
environments 
at 
Minnesota 

and most recently Penn State. 
Over that span, the defense 
surrendered 23 goals.

Since the Wolverines’ mid-

season hot streak — when they 
won seven straight, including 
three on the road — Michigan 
has won twice or more in a row 
only once, conveniently at Yost 
Ice Arena.

And though it has won 75 

percent 
of 
its 
neutral-site 

games (3-1), Michigan is 4-10 
on the road compared to 12-2 
at home.

All of that is to say the 

Wolverines haven’t proven they 
can win more than one game 
in a row very many times this 
season, especially when those 
contests aren’t played at Yost.

A first-round bye will mean 

everything for Michigan. It 
will mean an automatic bid to 
the NCAA Tournament via a 
conference championship win 
is just two games away instead 
of three.

“Hopefully, we can figure it 

out,” Copp said.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Andrew Copp and Michigan could need to win three games in three days next week to make the NCAA Tournament.

“It’s going to 

dictate how are 
year is looked at, 

basically.”

BUZZFEED, BUT BETTER

DISTINCTIVE MARCH HOLIDAYS

Wednesday, March 11, 2015 // The Statement

I

n a week full of midterms and 
bitter walks of single-digit-
degree weather, I stumbled 

upon a reflection room at the back 
of the third floor of the Michigan 
League. The space was 18 feet by 8 
feet, white stucco walled, and bar-
ren, besides three faded-orange 
armchairs and two square coffee 
tables shoved against the right side 
of the narrow room.

I paused in the doorway thinking 

for a moment that I had been mis-
taken, that I had read the placard on 
the wall wrong, that I had stumbled 
into an unused office instead of a 
reflection room — a place I read 
about online and imagined with 
large windows stretching across the 
walls, decorated carpets, live plants 
and designated, almost illustrious, 
places to sit.

After re-reading the placard on 

the wall I made my way inside and 
slouched, backpack still strapped 
to my back, coat still trapping my 
knees, into one of the armchairs. 
The orange fabric was ripped and 
peeled back, exposing the fleshy, 
fluffy insides of the chair’s center 
cushion. The singular window in 
the top corner or the room let in a 
ghostly white light from the grey 
sky that day.

Reflection rooms are advertised 

on the University’s Multi-Ethnic 
Student Affairs portion of the stu-
dent life website. There are eight 
on campus. Each is intended for any 
University community member, of 
any or no religion, to reflect, medi-
tate, or pray.

I sat in silent for some minutes, 

phone tucked away in my coat pock-
et untouched, eyes open but vaguely 
blurred, not focusing on anything. I 
began to realize why the room was 
intentionally so simple. The empty 
walls and limited lighting grew on 
me: the room’s minimalism halted 
my outward observance of my sur-
roundings. The window was so high 

up the wall and so small that there 
was no view to look at, nothing to 
distract.

Though there are thousands of 

types of meditation, most types 
involve the underlying concept 
that one must focus on the present 
moment and when outside thoughts 
come to the mind, as it is only 
human, acknowledge the thoughts, 
but then set them aside.

As I began to meditate, I failed 

at it — being present in the moment 
and not focusing on other thoughts 
besides those of being present — 
and instead became consumed by 
the idea of the controlled thought.

It came naturally to me that in 

meditation intentionally not think-
ing thoughts was a skill, a process 
and a useful tactic to reaching a 
meditative state. But what about 
beyond meditation? What about 
the constant thoughts we have in 
our everyday lives? Are expansive, 
curiosity-driven thoughts — ones I 
always believed to be a healthy part 
of growth and new thinking — at 
times misguided? Can they nega-
tively control your brain’s efforts 
when focused on instead of appro-
priately set aside?

Cognitive-behavioral therapy is 

a therapy used to reinforce health-
ier thinking. When experiencing 
any event each of us has automatic 
thoughts. According to CBT think-
ing, these immediate thoughts are 
how we perceive situations in our 

world and they directly influence 
how we feel emotionally. When 
these thoughts are negative or twist 
the reality of a situation they can be 
unhealthy (so unhealthy they can 
lead to anxiety and/or depression).

In a University setting we are so 

often pushed constantly to think, 
think more, and think more again. 
In class discussions professors ask 
us to expand on our comment; in 
social settings, we are expected to 
challenge ourselves in the conver-
sations we have with our peers; in 
student clubs, in writing academic 
papers, in writing anything, we 
inherently push and push at ideas. 
A concept we thought of as a small 
idea one day, the next day might 
expand into a research project, 
but is there ever a line crossed, a 
moment of more than needed? Is 
there a point where a new thought is 
just too much, is distracting rather 
than directing, is poisonous to our 
brain?

Though these questions seem to 

be naturally abstract and utterly 
lacking of concrete answers, sit-
ting in the reflection room, it felt 
as if this room was one big, fat 
answer to these questions. Reflec-
tion rooms are times for self reflec-
tion, are spaces for controlling what 
most usually are uncontrollable 
thoughts, are spaces for sorting 
out the automatic, twisted think-
ing from the extensive yet directive 
thinking.

My Cultural Currency: Calculating my Indian-ity

“

You’re not even like really Indi-
an,” the white girl said.

“What do you mean?” I said, 

gesturing to my brown face, hands 
and arms. I didn’t know if she need-
ed glasses or was just stupid.

“Well, I mean like you’re not 

really ‘Indian Indian.’ Like, you’re 
not, like, really, like all of the other 
Indians,” the white girl said.

I made a face, confused about 

what this girl was getting at. I 
wanted to give her the benefit of 
doubt — maybe she didn’t want to 
make assumptions about my South 
Asian ethnicity? But wait, I thought, 
she had already made the assump-
tion when she told me I wasn’t really 
Indian and, to be fair, she was correct.

This girl was trying to tell me 

that I didn’t fit into her perception 
— mold, stereotype, whatever you 
want to call it — of what she views as 
the typical Indian-American at the 
University: someone who is heavily 
involved in dance activities and has 
predominantly 
Indian-American 

friends.

Neither of these traits are bad 

things, but I don’t possess either 
of them. I can’t dance for shit and, 
while I have Indian friends, I don’t 
exclusively befriend other desis. 
And then I had an identity crisis.

I knew I was ethnically and tech-

nically of Indian origin. But did my 
brown skin, black hair, and soft spot 
for samosas really make me Indian 
enough? I knew, for my sake, I had to 

find the answer.

So, using my limited knowledge 

of mathematics — remember I 
almost failed Calculus — I created 
an equation to help me understand 
my Indian-ity using this girl’s crite-
rion:

(# of years with dance experience) 

x (# of IASA shows you’ve been a 
part of) / (How many white friends 

you have)

The higher your number, the 

more Indian you are. But, I then 
realized, by this equation, most of 
the Indian people in India wouldn’t 
even be considered Indian. It’s 
ridiculous to quantify someone’s 
ethnicity and even more preposter-
ous to suggest that just because they 
do not fit into your one-dimensional 
perspective, their identity is negat-
ed.

I needed to help this girl under-

stand that there are, quite literally, 
a billion other Indians all over the 
world that don’t fit into whatever 

idea she’s got in her head.

I wanted to tell her that just 

because she could pull out exact 
figures about her 15-percent Ger-
man, 25-percent Polish, 10-per-
cent Native American, 40-percent 
Scottish and 10-percent Irish roots, 
doesn’t mean I, or any other person 
of color, is obligated to do the same.

“She’s not even really Mexi-

can you know,” my editor said. I 
was fifteen, sitting with a group of 
upperclassmen in my newspaper 
class after school to discuss design 
options for our two-page spread on 
the newest education initiative our 
school had undertaken.

I didn’t lift my head from the 

computer I was designing on, but 
listened intently.

“Yeah, she’s not a practicing 

Catholic and that, like, is a really 
big deal for Mexicans,” my editor 
said. The other girls around me 
murmured in agreement and nod-
ded. “I mean, yeah, she makes like 
good Mexican food, but like, that’s 
really it right? That’s all that’s really 
Mexican about her.”

I glanced back at my adviser, a 

woman of Mexican descent, who 
frequently spoke about her love for 
her heritage’s food and how impor-
tant her last name, which was Span-
ish for “chain” and did not change 
after she was married, was to her.

She didn’t have to prove those 

girls a thing.

A

t a small ceremony on Feb. 26, students from the Arab-
American community on campus gathered to dedi-
cated a new multicultural lounge on the third floor of 

North Quad. The gathering was small and quiet, with no more 
than two dozen students in attendance.

But for many, the lounge was a significant step in gaining 

recognition on campus. Recognition, it seems, is something 
these communities have been lacking.

In the years since 9/11, discrimination against Arab and 

Muslim Americans has become a common — yet often under-
reported — occurrence in the United States. In the wake of the 
attacks, Ann Arbor was no different, as instances of “venom-
ous rhetoric” against The Office of Academic Multicultural 
Initiatives and Muslim Students’ Association were document-
ed in the weeks following the attack.

“Arab-Americans are facing a dual challenge as Americans 

they suffer from the same grief as their fellow citizens as 
persons of Arab and Muslim descent, they are under attacks 
arising from a presumption of guilt,” The Michigan Daily’s 
Editorial Board wrote on Sept. 16, 2001.

And these issues persist today.
In February, the murder of three Muslim students at the 

University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill sparked a national 
conversation surrounding hate crimes against Muslims. And 
locally, an Arab-American Muslim man was assaulted in Dear-
born at a Kroger in front of his family on Feb. 12.

In response to these events — and other recent anti-Muslim 

and anti-Arab hate crimes — the University’s Arab and Muslim 
American Studies Program hosted a closed town hall meet-
ing for Middle Eastern, North African and Muslim students 
on Feb. 23. The event was created to honor the victims and to 
build a community on campus.

“The purpose of the town hall is two-fold,” the program 

wrote in the event description on Facebook, “To process and 
grieve for the victims of hate crimes, and to build allyship and 
solidarity across groups on campus that represent Muslim 

and/or Arab U of M community members.”

But finding support for a community that is not recognized 

in many official capacities can prove challenging.

***

“We’re the invisible category that’s on campus,” said LSA 

sophomore Mekarem Eljamal, spokesperson for the Students 
Allied for Freedom and Equality and executive board member 
of the Middle East and Arab Network.

It’s a common sentiment among Arab-American students.
The U.S. census and most government-produced documents 

— including those produced for admission to the University — 
do not include “Arab” in their demographics. Instead, these 
groups are categorized as “White,” despite major discrepan-
cies between white and non-white experiences, said Sally 
Howell, a assistant professor of Arab-American history and 
culture at the University’s Dearborn campus.

“According to the U.S. census they’re white; but, according 

to our popular culture, they’re not white,” Howell said.

Evelyn Alsultany, an associate professor in American cul-

ture and coordinator of the University’s program in Arab and 
Muslim American studies, said the lack of identification often 
means that Arab Americans are left out of academic discus-
sions of race and ethnicity in the U.S.

“I felt that, growing up, my experience was not one of white-

ness or normative identity,” Alsultany said. “I’d watched a lot 
of subtle assumptions about my father — questions about ter-
rorism, questions about where he’s from and how he makes his 
money, questions like that when I was very young.”

Alsultany is one of a limited number of Arab and Muslim 

American faculty members on campus. After attending the 
University as an undergrad, she went to graduate school at 
Stanford University with the desire to study Arab and Mus-
lim American culture. At the time, she said she was discour-
aged from doing so by advisers and told to pursue a graduate 
degree in one of the established fields, such as Native Ameri-
can studies.

But after 9/11, everything changed. Alsultany, still in gradu-

ate school, said she saw the interest and inquiry into Arab-
American communities increase dramatically.

“Things really changed in terms of larger public seeing very 

explicitly the radicalization of Arab and Muslim Americans 
and there was more attention to Arab and Muslim Americans 
and jobs opened up in academia,” she said.

Since helping to establish the University’s program — one of 

only three in the country to focus on Arab-American identity 
— Alsultany said she sees herself as a resource for students in 
the community. The program is unique from other programs 
nationally in that it examines issues related specifically to the 
experiences of Arabs in the United States, such as the impact 
of government surveillance programs and media portrayals of 
the war on terror.

“We want to look at how culture and religion can become 

political or politicized and what the impact of that is on those 
communities,” Alsultany said.

While remaining hopeful for the future, she said it has been 

a slow process establishing the program at the University.

Tracking enrollment rates of Arab-American students at the 

University proves difficult even for experts in the community. 
Some point to this lack of data as indicative of the tendency 
for the community to be overlooked when it comes to diversity 
initiatives on campus.

In a recent survey conducted by The Michigan Daily of 443 

randomly selected undergraduates, about 3 percent of respon-
dents identified themselves as Arab. This is slightly higher 
than the statewide population of Arabs, which sits at about 2 
percent according to estimates by the Arab American Institute.

And anecdotal evidence suggests that the community on 

campus has grown in recent years. Matthew Stiffler, a Uni-
versity lecturer in the Department of American Culture, who 
received a doctorate in Arab-American studies from the Uni-

versity in 2010, said he has observed a changing tide in the way 
Arab-American students — particularly those from Dearborn 
— view Ann Arbor.

In addition to his role at the University, Stiffler is also 

a researcher at the Arab American Museum in Dearborn, 
located about forty-five minutes east of Ann Arbor. Dearborn 
neighbors Detroit and developed under many of the same driv-
ing forces, namely the auto manufacturers and local commerce 
that grew to support blue-collar households. The city is cur-
rently home to one of the University’s two satellite campuses 
as well as the highest proportion of Arab Americans out of any 
city in the U.S. — over 40 percent.

At the Dearborn campus, Arab-American enrollment has 

been high ever since the 1970s and ‘80s, Stiffler said, following 
trends in Arab immigration to the city. The cam-
pus appealed to families who wanted to maintain 
close ties while their children were attending 
school. At present, it is estimated that the student 
body at the Dearborn campus is at least 25 percent 
of Arab descent, if not more.

“I think they see Dearborn as a good school 

that they’re proud to go to — proud to have in 
their community,” Stiffler said. “It is a much more 
diverse school than UM-Ann Arbor … It makes for 
a much more diverse learning environment.”

By contrast, Arab-American enrollment in Ann 

Arbor has only recently seen increases — again, 
evidenced anecdotally. Twenty years ago, a hand-
ful of students from Dearborn would enroll at the 
University’s Ann Arbor campus every year, Stiff-
ler said. That number could be closer to 100 today, 
but even so a mix of cultural and political tensions 
could be dissuading some students from applying 
to or matriculating at the Ann Arbor campus.

Scholarships and outreach efforts have done 

their part in increasing the University’s appeal. 
One program in particular, The Brehm Scholars, 
is credited with a significant increase in Arab-
American enrollment in Ann Arbor. This pro-
gram offers full-ride, four-year scholarships to a 
select group of graduating students from Dearborn’s Fordson 
High School, where 95 percent of the student body are of Arab 
descent.

While the program only offers scholarships to about four 

students per year — a scholarship that can be extended to eight 
years if the students are accepted to the University’s medical 
school — the impact is much broader. Students in the program 
have become unofficial ambassadors for the University and 
the city of Ann Arbor. Keeping close ties with the community, 
they have played a significant role in shaping perceptions of 
the University in the Dearborn community.

...
In 2014, Fordson sent twenty-two students to the Ann Arbor 

campus, nearly as many as it sent to UM-Dearborn.

“That there are other students here now helps a lot — the 

fact that they’re not coming alone,” said Dorene Markel, direc-
tor of the University’s Brehm Center.

Dearborn has historically provided Arab Americans a safe 

haven in a country that is less than understanding about their 
culture. While only an estimated 24 percent of Arab Ameri-
cans are Muslim, the religion is often conflated with all mem-
bers of the community. Especially in the United States, such 
cultural and religious misappropriations can lead to tension 
and, in certain cases, violence against individuals perceived as 
Arab.

Across the United States, hostility toward the Arab commu-

nity has grown increasingly worse since 9/11, said Howell, an 
assistant professor at UM-Dearborn. For Arab-American stu-
dents just trying to get a college degree, the discrimination is 
both tedious and exhausting.

“The hostility that you see in American culture towards 

Arabs and Muslims today is unprecedented and it’s worse 
than it was after 9/11 by far and people are aware of it and 

are cautious,” Howell said.

In all media, misconceptions of Arab culture and the reli-

gion of Islam have been widely perpetuated. Howell provided 
an example: a December 2011 episode of Fox’s animated com-
edy “The Simpsons,” where one of the characters claims that 
Michigan is under Sharia law — the legal system of Islamic 
religion. The animation also depicted a scene of UM-Dear-
born’s campus.

But, in general, Howell said the Dearborn campus provides 

Arab-American students a certain level of comfort.

“It is a safe place — it’s not a perfect place — but it is a safe 

place to be an Arab-American student,” Howell said of the 
UM-Dearborn campus. “I think it would be a big deal on our 
campus if someone were explicitly racist toward an Arab.”

***

In Ann Arbor, discrimination against Arabs and Muslims 

is sometimes hard to define. Though official incidents of hate 
crimes on campus are rare — the University’s Division of Pub-
lic Safety and Security reported one instance of religious-
based bias crime in 2013 — cases of discrimination are widely 
discussed in the Arab and Muslim communities.

LSA senior Saher Rathur, president of Muslim Students’ 

Association, described various types of discrimination she and 
her friends have experienced on campus. These can include 
everything from dirty looks to biased speech to various forms 
of microaggression. In the Muslim community, she said those 
who wear the traditional Muslim headscarf — the hijab — often 
face the most serious backlash. She cited an incident on State 
Street, where a passenger in a passing car yelled “something 
really derogatory” at her friend who was wearing the hijab.

Cultural insensitivity can perpetuate the classroom as well. 

LSA senior Raya Saksouk, co-chair of the MEdAN, said that 
discrimination can often manifest as a feeling of alienation 
during discussions about certain academic topics. As an Inter-
national Studies major, she said she has experienced this first-
hand.

“People talk about the Middle East, but in very abstract 

political science type of ways,” Saksouk said. “Sometimes peo-
ple would say things that are problematic — in the classroom 
or in student organizations — and those situations are hard to 
navigate.”

Andrew Shryock, the Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of 

Anthropology, said it can be difficult for instructors and 
administrators — even those with good intentions — to know 
how to best support Arab and Muslim students.

“Very often people who support Arabs and Muslims on cam-

pus don’t actually support them in a way that’s meaningful for 

Arabs and Muslims. It’s a default ‘we hope you feel comfortable 
here’ kind of support,” Shryock said. “But it’s not necessarily 
based on any kind of intimate knowledge of their community 
or even affection for their causes or their traditions.”

Shryock said he takes efforts to avoid the group mentali-

ties that often only serve to divide students and create envi-
ronments that discourage real education. Such divisions can 
come into play during tense political discussions, such as those 
that occurred during the UM Divest campaign in the spring 
of 2014.

“That’s a mobilizing and fighting issue, people kind of team 

up to engage in that issue,” Shryock said. “I personally am not 
a teaming up kind of person. I like to, in my courses, create 
frameworks in which people can actually understand some-

thing about the Arab and Muslim world that’s not 
available to them in the United States.”

“It’s something where people have very strong 

feelings and feel they can’t trust the other side, 
and that always produces climate issues. It’s hard 
to work through that,” Shryock added in an e-mail 
to the Daily.

Portions of the community gathered last spring 

when the Students Allied for Freedom and Equal-
ity launched a weeklong sit-in following Central 
Student Government’s indefinite postponement of 
a vote on a proposed divestment resolution, which 
called for the University to look into its invest-
ments in corporations that hold military contracts 
with the Israeli military and therefore support 
human rights violations against Palestinians. As 
the movement gained attention across campus, 
many students interviewed — reflecting back 
on the campaign — said it served as a watershed 
moment for the Arab American and Muslim com-

munities as a whole.

During the UM Divest campaign, students in 

support of divestment gathered in the CSG cham-
bers every day after class for the week leading up 
to the CSG meeting where the resolution would 

be voted on. Mekarem Eljamal said the gatherings drew many 
Arab and Muslim students out of the woodwork who had not 
previously been involved in such organizations. She said the 
protest lead to a shift in how Arab-American students inter-
acted with each other.

“Divest rallied so many people together,” Eljamal said. 

“People saw faces that they hadn’t seen … I felt like there was a 
bit more cohesiveness and more of a collective.”

This new sense of community contributed to the creation of 

the the Middle East and Arab Network, a new student organi-
zation founded in the beginning of Fall 2014. Eljamal, who is 
one of seven executive board members, sees the organization 
as a continuation of conversations about the Arab-American 
community that occurred during the UM Divest movement.

Saksouk describes the organization as having a two-prong 

approach: creating spaces for Arab and Middle Eastern identi-
fied students to talk about issues within and outside of their 
communities as well as creating campus-wide events to engage 
with the greater student body.

The organization has become increasingly active on campus 

and has scheduled several community workshops and dinners 
in honor of Arab Heritage Month. This is the second year that 
Arab Heritage Month has been celebrated on campus and is set 
to occur from March 16 to April 10.

Like the establishment of a new multicultural lounge and 

establishment of the Arab and Muslim Studies Program, Alsul-
tany, coordinator of the University’s Arab and Muslim Ameri-
can Studies Program, said the heritage month was another 
positive recognition of the community on campus.

“These are new moments and they are significant and show 

that spaces are being created, slower, but spaces are being cre-
ated to respond to the needs of Arab and Muslim students on 
campus,” she said.

Primetime Players: 

The multiple roles of the University’s cheerleading squad

by Akshay Seth, Daily Film Columnist

B

efore agreeing to sit down for an interview, Pam 
St. John needed confirmation that any subsequent 
write-up or article resulting from the following 

week’s talk should take pains not to wheel her inside the 
orbit of attention. The focus of the writing, she wrote, must 
remain on Michigan’s Cheer Squad, a team she has spent 
the last 31 years coaching. And her reasons, left unsaid, 
seemed reasonable, even if with a characteristically PR-
influenced tinge.

St. John’s office is a small room at the end of a long hall-

way in the basement of the Weidenbach Building on South 
State Street. Inside, the walls are sheeted with a thick col-
lage of posters, pictures, calendars, whiteboards and the 
occasional post-it note.

Beneath all the layering, almost hidden from view, are 

two massive banners — the kind found dangling from the 
rafters in most high school gymnasiums — that commemo-
rate the team’s victories at the 2013 and 2014 National Cheer 
Association championships. Slight and perpetually smiling, 
St. John points at them with informality, speaking with the 
same restrained tone that frames the rest of her words.

“We’ve been lucky and fortunate to have done well the 

last couple of years,” she said.

It’s this thoughtful composure, also evident in the team 

members’ demeanors, that contradicts the violent bursts of 
strength and peril showcased in each minute of each per-
formance. When LSA sophomore Josiah Ault, who is about 
to complete his second year as a cheerleader, describes the 
danger, he smiles serenely.

“All of us are quite literally putting our lives in each oth-

er’s hands,” he said. “It feels like more than just a team sport 
because of having to put all this trust in someone else and 
also trusting yourself to be in the position where you have 
to stop others from getting hurt.”

 
 
 ***

The practices are arranged throughout the school year 

to sync with football and basketball schedules, and eventu-
ally the team is divided in the lead-up to the national cheer-
leading championships. While the entire squad performs at 
football games, only a portion — called “Primetime” — can 
be seen at the basketball matches in the latter half of the 
year. The rest of the cheerleaders, usually the ones who 
have been on the team longer and are thus better attuned to 
the sport, spend practice time honing a routine that will be 
showcased at Nationals in Florida this April.

“Whether you’re competing at the end of the year or are 

performing at a game, that issue of safety is always there 
and it keeps pressure levels pretty high,” Ault said. “You 

can’t really slack off when you’re getting ready to throw, 
then immediately catch an entire person.”

Sitting through a typical practice is a little bit like watch-

ing the piecemeal construction of a hammered metal sculp-
ture. The final product is a wonder to behold, peppered 
with the rhythmic cadence of the “one-two-three” counts 
uttered by anyone in earshot to frame stunts. Each count is 
like a hammer stroke.

Within a constant and palpably visible struggle for bal-

ance — teammates floating in the air, flipping an impos-
sible number of times before landing — the most resonant 
images are of them grimacing or gritting their teeth as they 
lock elbows and wait for the impact of reentry. Every stunt 
is dizzyingly complex, requiring a framework of carefully 
crafted choreography that the cheerleaders spend months 
— even years — practicing.

“One hand out of place, or even a few degrees off, and it 

won’t land,” said LSA freshman Priscilla Huddleston, who 
joined the squad last fall.

Actively recruited by St. John while still a high school 

student, Huddleston was promoted to the competition team 
quickly after coming onboard. April will be the first time 
she competes at the national, collegiate level, but before 
becoming a part of Michigan Cheer, Huddleston already 
had years of experience participating in tournaments spon-
sored by national cheer organizations.

These events, often called All-Star Cheerleading, are 

open to competitors of varying age groups and stand apart 
from typical high school cheer teams that are more close-
ly associated with their school’s other sports teams. As 
opposed to composing defense or offense routines usually 
seen on sidelines or during halftimes of football games, All-
Star cheerleaders focus on tumbling, gymnastics and the 
stunts needed to hone competitive skills.

For a time, Huddleston teetered between the two worlds 

of high school and All-Star cheer, but ultimately settled for 
the more competition-oriented events.

“I just fell in love with the tumbling; I fell in love with the 

gymnastics,” Huddleston said. “The main difference in All-
Star is that you’re cheering for yourself, which is much more 
empowering than just being an adjective.”

Her parents shelled out the money needed to shuttle 

between tournaments, often without any help from the 
leagues organizing the events. Describing the traveling 
schedule, Huddleston said the competitive cheer from her 
pre-college years can best be labeled a “rich man’s sport.”

Those unable or unwilling to pay their way through All-

Stars would be limited to the sidelines of high school cheer, 

which, by Michigan law, still does not allow men to com-
pete in end-of-year tournaments.

 
 
 ***

Though the stigma against male cheerleaders exists and 

is acknowledged by men on the team, most are quick to 
point out that a large portion of the community, especially 
at college, is extremely supportive. Quinton Carter-Jones, a 
fifth year LSA senior who has been with the team through-
out his time at the University, said on most occasions, peo-
ple are simply ill-informed.

“You’ll definitely have friends from high school or cer-

tain family members making fun of you for it,” Carter-
Jones said. “But the fact of the matter is you’re doing it 
because you want to foster self-confidence. You’re not 
doing it because of what anyone else thinks.”

“And honestly, how many people will ever get to say they 

know how to throw a girl over their head and catch her,” 
he added.

Yet on a more concrete level, the rules preventing men 

from taking part in the year-end meets for high school 
cheer also create a rift in the male and female talent pools. 
Many of the men joining Michigan Cheer don’t know how 
to tumble. Fewer have had any formal training in gymnas-
tics.

“A lot of the time with guys, it takes a couple years to get 

them confident in their own abilities,” St. John said. “We’re 
very much starting from the ground up, but they’re stron-
ger athletes because of it.”

Carter-Jones recalled the first time he tried to throw 

someone.

“It was one of the most awkward moments of my life,” he 

said. “I had no idea who she was so I stayed really far back, 
just kind of threw her in the most literal sense of the word. 
Obviously, she didn’t go very high, so I panicked thinking 
this person would be horribly disfigured because of me and 
I tried to bear-hug her on the way down.”

Shaking his head, he muttered something to the tune 

of “horrible technique” before laying out, in great detail, 
the proper way to hurl another human body — the athletic 
stance, upright posture and vice-like grip he has since per-
fected and wishes could show his younger self. Confidence, 
and with it the willingness to place a measure of weight 
behind even the smallest actions, he explains, is the key.

“You can’t have any inhibitions. And they didn’t go away 

until Coach Pam had had some time to kind of nudge me in 
the right direction,” he said.

Personal Statement: Forging an Iron Man

by Eric Ferguson, Daily Columnist

I 

can tell you about three important and seemingly hap-
hazard aspects of the person I was just prior to start-
ing college. First, I was obsessed with grades. Second, 

I actively avoided situations where I would have to make a 
decision. And third, I had a not-so-minor obsession with the 
alternate universes created in the genres of science fiction 
and high fantasy.

All three of these aspects of me remain unchanged; 

thankfully, many other things have changed. Four years 
ago (and in some respects as little as one year ago), I was 
incapable of actively thinking about my future and unable to 
fully acknowledge the existence of perspectives other than 
my own. These attitudes must have led to many unknown-
unknowns; I’m slightly shocked more of them haven’t come 
back to bite me in the ass.

But over these last four years I have learned. Now, I have 

never felt more confident in who I am and what I want to 
do. Hard work, conscious reflection, massive privilege, and 
dumb luck are what enabled this; they are factors in an equa-
tion too complex for me to solve. If college is a time for young 
adults to broaden their minds, though, I think I have suc-
ceeded.

However, 
I’m 
not 
done. 

There’s time left still, and I 
want to use part of it to deci-
sively engage questions like 
“How’s your semester going?” 
“What are you doing after 
graduation?” and (most impor-
tantly) “If you could be any fic-
tional character, who would you 
choose?” from which I would’ve 
shrunk as a freshman here. This 
is my chance to answer them.

 
 
***

“How’s 
your 
semester 

going?” is a favorite of every 
adult I know, and, until this 
last semester, it always caused 
me somewhat of a panic. My 
parents pushed me to achieve 
in school from an early age; 
they wanted me to do well. I 
took that initial push and slow-
ly magnified it. Over time, it 
became an obsession at the core 
of my entire life.

This obsession propelled me to great heights, but it had 

a darker side as well. Until the last few months, I felt as if 
grades corresponded to my life. I felt that if I didn’t get nearly 
straight-A grades, I would be some kind of worthless waste 
of a person. That attitude transferred to other facets of my 
life as well. I have often felt as if one misstep among friends 
or at an internship would somehow render me worthless. 
As such, I was utterly fixated on external evaluations of my 
work and my decisions.

I have a certain professor from last semester to thank for 

helping me get over this fixation. In his class, he made me 
grapple with some of the toughest questions out there — 
those pertaining to peacemaking, justice, and reconciliation 
in situations of mind-boggling complexity.

Halfway through that class, I became despondent. I had 

spent twenty hours working on a single three-page paper 
that was supposed to be a reflection on what I had learned 
so far in his class, and I thought what I turned in was inco-
herent. I had no idea how to answer that prompt, and I felt 

as if I were a dead man.

To my great surprise, I ended up with an A in that class 

and some variant of an A in all my others. However, I have 
no confidence that these grades are comparable to each 
other. Unlike my other professors whose assignments and 
exams almost always demanded some kind of definitive 
answer to a question, this professor was different. His goal 
wasn’t for his students to develop such answers to the ques-
tions he posed; he knew life isn’t that simple. Instead, he 
challenged us almost every single class period to state what 
we had learned.

I think his overall aim was to have us engage with intense 

complexity, and to make people like me realize that there 
are no “answers” or “grades” in real life. He taught me that 
while utter dependence on external evaluation might seem 
helpful in school, it is no way to live. I cannot always wait 
for someone else to evaluate my work and my decisions. I 
must do so first. He called that job self-leadership; it’s one 
I’m finally ready to take on.

 
 
 
***

In the past, my answer to “What are you doing after grad-

uation?” has often been silence. The future wasn’t something 
I was at all interested in thinking about, mostly because I 
was so fixated on what grades I was getting in school. But 
it was also partly because I never really considered the fact 
that graduation would eventually happen.

This irrational attitude manifested in many forms, an 

early one of which being how I applied to a single university 
coming out of high school. Once here, I attempted to be busy 
and repeatedly told myself that I was. I learned if I present-
ed that to the world, people generally wouldn’t ask about my 
future plans. I let my academic and personal interests run 
amok, giving little conscious thought to their organization 
or to where they might lead me later on.

But these interests did develop — albeit ever so slowly — 

and as they did, I came to know what job opportunities exist 
for the policy-obsessed nerd I am. My interests coalesced 
into two internships in Washington, D.C. They’ve given me 
a valuable head start in the job search, and I will always be 
grateful to the people I met in each. Moreover, I’ve realized 
that everything I’ve been able to do — from being admitted 
to the Ford School of Public Policy to co-founding a student 

organization to forging what I hope are lifelong networks 
of friends — has ultimately depended not on abstractions, 
but on real people. I still need to remind myself of this point 
often, and as I move forward in life I resolve to do so until it’s 
something I can’t possibly forget.

 
 
 
***

The last (and most important) question is “If you could 

be any fictional character, who would you choose?” This 
one cuts deep, as I’ve always loved immersing myself in fic-
tional universes. The transcendent abilities of characters 
such as Ender Wiggin, Will Stanton, Lyra Belacqua, and 
Tony Stark/Iron Man captured my entire imagination as a 
child and young adult. I would want to be whichever char-
acter happened to be in front of me. All seemed to have some 
power or superhuman understanding that allowed them to 
shape the course of their respective universes—all of which 
seemed so much better than my boring, real one.

The only answer I can ever remember giving is Iron Man 

— as in Robert Downey Jr.’s portrayal of that character. It 
was a slightly ridiculous choice. Iron Man is a suit, not a per-
son. The person who built it is Tony Stark, and what gave 

rise to the suit itself was his dis-
covery that the power core he 
built to keep bits of shrapnel sus-
pended in his chest could be put 
to other, grander uses.

There certainly are benefits 

to being such a rich and brilliant 
man as Stark; however, there are 
massive risks to consider as well. 
In the movies, the power of Iron 
Man is not something Stark tends 
to handle very well. He tends to 
think he knows what’s best for 
others, and through acting on 
those notions he does at least 
as much harm as he does good. 
It’s something I’ve only recently 
come to realize myself, and I 
hope that realization will keep 
me far away from such situations 
in the future.

 
 
***

Now, some real answers. My 

semester is going well. My three 
classes are some of the best I’ve 

ever taken, and I’m having fun trying to make the most of 
my remaining time on campus. I’m shooting for a job in D.C. 
after graduation; our world is an unjust and scary one, and I 
think I can do something about that. And I would say to the 
last question that I wouldn’t want to pick a fictional char-
acter. As fantastic as they are, these people don’t exist, and 
their worlds are fascinating without my being in them.

I have definitely evolved over the last four years. I have 

changed and been re-formed in ways that touch my soul.

But I still catch myself thinking about that Iron Man 

suit. I’m somehow compelled to see myself inside it. I can-
not resist the imagery of using some great creation of mine 
to create change, a creation that draws its power from the 
heart of me.

I know now that when I act on this temptation, I am obli-

gated to use great care. I know also that this obligation is a 
weighty thing.

But I will shoulder it anyways. I will try through what I 

do to give back; to shine some small light into the shadowed 
corners of the world in which I live.

competed for the first time this year on 
Feb. 21 and was very excited to place fourth 
overall. Each school choreographs their 
own eight minute dance, makes their own 
costumes and props, and often records their 
own music or performs it live. The work that 
goes into these performances is extremely 
extensive, but the results are magnificent. 
There is no greater celebration of Filipino 
culture in the Midwest.

VISUAL STATEMENT: BATTLE OF THE BAMBOO

Students from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign were ecstatic to win the first place 

LEFT: Kapwa at Loyola University is a very large 
performance group that won last year and placed 
second this year.

The event drew a crowd of nearly 1,000 people this year.

Michigan student Katalina Faraon, who is also the performance chair of FASA, starred in Semba as 
the priestess. 

Battle of the Bamboo is not exclusively for college organizations. These students from Northside 
College Prep High School are from one of two Chicago high schools that competed.
