STUDENT GOVERNMENT
VP hopefuls
talk reform
of inactive
CSG council

Candidates aim to
bring more relevance
to under-utilized
University Council
0
By STEPHEN YAROS
Daily Staff Reporter
This week's Central Student Gov-
ernment elections will give students
the opportunity to elect the next leader
of the University Council, a body made
up of student delegates from each indi-
vidual school at the University.
The council constitutes half of CSG's
legislative branch, complemented by
the main assembly. Over the past year
UC has met with key administrators,
such as University President Mary Sue
Coleman, to discuss University issues.
Because the UC is currently only in
its second year of operation, it has yet
to exercise its full power. For example,
although the UC appointed the elec-
tion director for this year, they have
yet to collaborate with student leaders
from the various schools on-campus to
pass any meaningful resolutions.

Like the U.S. Senate, The vice
president of CSG heads the UC. With
the potential to effectively shape the
responsibilities of the UC, the vice
presidential candidates said they are
eager and excited to take on the chal-
lenge. LSA sophomore Bobby Dishell,
youMICH's vice presidential candidate
and current assembly representative,
put the council's reputation rather sim-
ply.
"It's verysimilar, asI'vebeentold, to
dealing with a two-year-old," Dishell
said, adding that the UC needs to be
more transparent so students and lead-
ers from across campus can better col-
laborate.
Despite the challenges the UC has
faced in the past two years, the can-
didates seem optimistic that there are
ways to better utilize the body.
LSA freshman Ethan Michaeli, the
independent vice presidential candi-
date, says he believes he understands
the UC's problem and hopes to make
some changes if elected.
"Right now it's more of a coun-
cil that advises the vice president,"
Michaeli said. "I'd like to change that
role to make them more active."

reform start-up that provides free

such as this have become increas-

School of Education to hear
Dale Stephens, one of the first

about the growing need of a
self-directed education system
and how going to college is not
the only key to success. His pre-
sentation was part of the EDU-
preneurship three-day boot
camp that took place over the
weekend and during Stephens'
own book tour for his new book
Hacking Your Education.
Stephens began his presen-
tation by discussing the roots
of his experience in alterna-
tive education; he dropped out
of the fifth grade at age 12 and
has been designing his educa-
tion ever since. But, he doesn't
use the term homeschooling
when referring to his educa-
tion outside the classroom; he
uses the term "unschooling," a
self-directed form of education
originating in the 1970s.

Graduate Student Council forms
75 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK 50 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK 15 YEARS AGO THIS
(MARCH 30,1938): (MARCH 31,1963): WEEK (MARCH 23,1998):

The first graduate students'
council was formed at the
Michigan Union. This would be
the first organized meeting of
graduate students of any school
in the nation. The purpose of its
initiation was to involve gradu-
ate students in more aspects of
University affairs.
University officials Herbert
Weisinger, Stuart Portner and
Ellsworth Raymond were elect-
ed to be the three chairmen of
the main divisions of the new
organization: housing, intel-
lectual coordination, and social
and athletic committees.

Michigan's men gymnasts
took their first NCAA title with
a total of 129 points; Southern
Illinois University came in sec-
ond, finishing with 73 points.
Michigan took first place five
times and tied for first in anoth-
er event. Captain Gil Larose
managed to win three indi-
vidual categories, including the
all-around, the long-horse and
the high bar. Other notable ath-
letes were Arno Lascari, taking
first on the parallel bars; Gary
Erwin, taking first on the tram-
poline; and Mike Henderson,
tying for first place for the floor
exercise round.

After the University's Board
of Regents approved advertise-
ments deemed by some to be
racist and sexist earlier in the
month, University President
Robben Fleming cracked down
on his disciplinary policies and
emphasized the urgency for
consequential punishments.
One of the steps the Univer-
sity took to combat the negative
image of the prior advertise-
ments among local high schools
was to place new ads in the
school's newspapers.

Debt Wizard app aids
University law stuents

Dance Marathon club
to host week of events

Mobile application
displays ways to pay
off law school debt
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
For theDaily
Michigan Law students
recently gained access to the
new "Debt Wizard" mobile appli-
cation, which makes financial
uncertainties a little bit clearerby
calculating debt and suggesting

ways to pay it off.
The app, released last month,
combines projected costs of the
Law School along with expected
annual salaries after graduation,
among other aspects, to predict
and approximate future debt.
Sarah Zearfoss, an assistant
Law dean, introduced the appli-
cation to the studentbody.
"The Debt Wizard helps to
fulfill our obligation-speaking
both generally as an institution of
higher education and specifically
as a public university -to provide

some tools to grapple with the
considerable complexities," Zear-
foss said inastatement.
Debt Wizard presents 11,000
different repayment routes to
inform students of their payback
options. Students can calculate
their costs simply by inputting
their expected level of annual sal-
ary,geographicalmarket,debtlevel
and type of employment. In turn,
the app shows the monthly income
needed to balance debt, housing
costs and other living expenses.
The resulting debt calculation
is based upon the four most wide-
ly used federal payment plans by
law students and the National
Association for Law Placement's
salary levels. The geographic
markets, in contrast, are defined
by national trends and include big
cities across the nation.
Zearfoss said the app was ini-
tially a project for her office, but
many other units contributed as
well.
One of the contributors, Kon-
stantin Voyk, who works in IT at
the Law School, said he worked
on developing a visual design that
would display calculation results
in a simplified, accessible way.
"The main challenge was com-
ing up with how we can visualize
it because it's a lot of data," Voyk
said. "We want to show financial
information to students, and the
new generation isveryvisual."
On the prospect of expansion
plans, Voyk added the app devel-
opment team is currently think-
ing about expanding the number
of cities and regions to allow for
more choices and accuracy.
Student feedhack has been
encouraging, Zearfoss said.
Alyce Thompson, a student at
both the Law School and School
of Urban Planning, said she
thinks the tool can be useful in a
universal way.
"The Debt Wizard is a great
tool for informing prospec-
tive students on the realities of
debt they'll be facing when they
graduate," Thompson said. She
added that its especially helpful
for understanding costs of dif-
ferent cities.

Saplings from
Anne Frank's tree
take root in U.S.
Saplings from the chestnut
tree that stood as a symbol of
0 hope for Anne Frank as she hid
from the Nazis for two years in
Amsterdam are being distrib-
uted to 11 locations in the United
States as part of a project that
aims to preserve her legacy and
promote tolerance.
The tree, one of the Jewish
teenager's only connections to
nature while she hid with her
family, was diseased and rotted
through the trunk when wind
and heavy rain toppled it in
August 2010. But saplings grown
from its seeds will be planted
starting in April, when the Chil-
dren's Museum of Indianapo-
lis will put the first one in the
ground.
The 11 U.S. locations, which
also include a park memorial-
izing 9-11 victims in New York

that was the heart of the deseg-

Rebels overthrew Central

president fled the capital, while
extra French troops moved to
secure the airport, officials said.
The rebels' invasion of the
capital came just two months
after they had signed a peace
agreement that would have let
President Francois Bozize serve
until 2016. That deal unraveled
in recent days, prompting the
insurgents' advance into Bangui

DAAP runs
CSG slate

Candidates

action, campus
diversity
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Despite consistent defeat in
student government elections
in recent years, the Defend
Affirmative Action Party is
running a presidential ticket
and a slate of 17 representative
candidates in the March 27 and
28 Central Student Govern-
ment elections.
Social Work student Ashley
Garrick, DAAP's presidential
candidate, is the only gradu-
ate student running for presi-
dent or vice president this year.
Increasing minority enroll-
ment is a major platform point
for the party, and Garrick said
the issue is personal for her.
"Sometimes I'm the only
black person in the class, or
the only minority in the class,"
Garrick said. "I have a hard
time understanding how we're
so quick to promote social jus-
tice and diversity and being

DAAP's platform also
includes a host of other social
issues, including support-
ing the passage of legislation
that would give some undoc-
umented residents a path to
citizenship, charging in-state
tuition rates for undocu-
mented Michigan residents
and supporting full rights for
LGBT students.
These platform points con-
trast with those of other cam-
paigns as none of the four
other candidates emphasize
that CSG should be an advo-
cate for social change. DAAP's
platform, however, lacks many
of the unifying issues of other

campaigns, such as promoting
entrepreneurship or address-
ing how student organizations
are funded.
LSA sophomore Chene
Karega, DAAP's candidate for
vice president, said while win-
ning the election is important,
it's also important to promote
affirmative action and social
issues.
"We do believe we can win
the presidency," she said. "But
it's also about the message,
because if we're not here talk-
ing about these things it won't
be talked about."
At the candidate's debate on
Thursday night, every presi-
dential candidate said they
supported affirmative action,
and Karega said DAAP will
continue to fight for its cam-
paign goals within CSG wheth-
er or not they win.
"If we don't win, we do plan
on working with our parties to
make sure our agenda is heard,
but more importantly we
always try to make our voice
heard at (assembly) meetings,"
she said.
Members of DAAP were
present at an assembly meet-
ing as recent as Tuesday when
they addressed representatives
about a march for immigrants'
rights in Washington, D.C. on
April 10.
While other parties such as
forUM might be advocating
for diversity, Karega said there
isn't enough emphasis on affir-
mative action.
DAAP's campaign man-
ager Issamar Almarez, who is
not a University student, said
DAAP's campaigners have
been going through the dorms
to talk with students, who
have been supportive of the
issues DAAP has been advo-
cating. Almarez added that she
believes many students agree
that issues such as declin-
ing minority enrollment are
important, but that they don't

Students hold male

Over $20,000
raised to support
medical relief
for children
By ARIANA ASSAF

Nothing guarantees a good
time like red fur coats, Chip-
pendales routines and pies
being thrown in faces.
On Sunday afternoon, nearly
200 people gathered at The
University Club in the Michi-
gan Union for the annual Mr.
Michigan competition, an event
put on by the Foundation for
International Medical Relief of
Children.
FIMRC co-president Maddy
Stumpos, an LSA senior,
described the competition as "a
male beauty pageant." During
the introduction, she and fellow

co-president, LSA senior Kelly
Ketchum, announced that the
organization had already raised
$20,000.
All proceeds are going
towards FIMRC's mission of
providing medical care for
underprivileged children
around the world.
Participants kicked off the
festivities with a flash-mob-
style dance routine to a mash-
up of songs by popular artists
including Justin Bieber and
Beyoncd, then moved on to indi-
vidual introductions of the con-
testants.
Some highlights included
learning that LSA sophomore
David Mullen-Muhr, who rep-
resented MRelay in the Mr.
Michigan competition, is an
ordained minister, while LSA
junior Matthew Johnson, who
was representing Circle K,
impressed the crowd by show-
ing off his salsa dancing skills
on his way to the stage.

Then came the talent por-
tion, in which LSA senior
Yianni Ellenikiotis, who
represented the Pre-Dental
Association, performed a
Chippendale dance routine -
and much to some onlookers'
appreciation - took a pie to
the abs later on.
LSA senior Graam Liu, Mot-
ley Crew's representative,
serenaded co-president Kelly
Ketchum. LSA senior Jihad
Komis, Mock Trial's represen-
tative, mastered the saltine
challenge.
Before the votes were cast,
LSA senior Joanna Connelly, a
friend of both Komis and John-
son, said, "Everyone was so
good. I want to vote for all of
them!"
Engineering senior Nicholas
Clift came in first place, receiv-
ing a Cottage Inn gift card as
well as the title of Mr. Michi-
gan, complete with a crown and
flower bouquet.

Mayoral group targets senate
in gun control ad campaign

Advertisements in
key states advocate
strong background
checks, bans
NEW YORK (AP) - A new
$12 million television ad cam-
paign from Mayors Against
Illegal Guns will push senators
in key states to back gun control
efforts, including comprehen-
sive background checks.
New York City Mayor
Michael Bloomberg announced
the ad buy Saturday - just days

after Senate Democrats touted
stronger background checks
while acknowledging insuffi-
cient support to restore a ban on
assault-style weapons to federal
gun control legislation.
"These ads bringthe voices of
Americans - who overwhelm-
ingly support comprehensive
and enforceable background
checks - into the discussion
to move senators to immedi-
ately take action to prevent gun
violence," Bloomberg said in a
statement issued by the group
he co-founded in 2006.
The two ads posted on
the group's website, called

"Responsible" and "Family,"
show a gun owner holding a
rifle while sitting on the back of
a pickup truck.
In one ad, the man says he'll
defend the Second Amendment
but adds "with rights come
responsibilities." The ad then
urges viewers to tell Congress to
support background checks.
In the other ad, the man,
a hunter, says "background
checks have nothing to do with
takingguns away from anyone."
The man then says closing loop-
holes will stop criminals and
the mentally ill from obtaining
weapons.

Politics over sound policy
School funding is once again at risk in the state of Michigan
A s Michigan begins its lengthy budgeting process, it appears
as though school funding is once again being put at risk.
Last week, a subcommittee in the Michigan legislature pro-
posed further potential cuts to Michigan universities. The Republi-
can-controlled subcommittee passed penalties in response to recent
contracts between universities and labor unions that aim to skirt
Michigan's new right-to-work law before it takes effect. If penalized,
the University could lose as much as $47 million between the cam-
puses. Despite general indignation against enormous education cuts
in the past, the Republican proposal plays petty politics with devas-
tating effects to education.
In December 2012, Michigan hurriedly people lined up outside of the Capitol in pro-
passed legislation that prohibits unions from test. Opponents of the bill argued that right-

DOING WITH MY LIFE.

Embracing my inner feminist

ike many men, I've spent
most of my life confused
and frustrated by the term
"feminism."
The overarch-
ing theme of
feminism in
my privileged-
white-upper-
class-male
background has '
predominantly JAMES
been negative, BRENNAN
focusing on
activists burn-
ing their bras, reading "The vagina
Monologues" and demanding equal
treatment while still expecting
men to pay for dinner. The term
was never really defined for me,
and despite a liberal upbringing
that focused on equality, I quietly
held feelings of discontent for so
called "feminists."
Then I spent two months living
with a Women's Studies major.
I have a bad habit of making jokes
about women, one I never really
noticed until my time living with
Rachel. We would consistently be
talking and I would make a (seem-
ingly) harmless joke about women
in subservient roles or holding less
value than men, and I could see the
frustration in her eyes. Since my
hometown is relatively conserva-
tive and I joined a fraternity my first
semester in college, making sex-
ist jokes was just a normal part of
everyday conversation. I don't feel,
and have never felt, that women are
actually lesser than men or restrict-
ed to certain aspects of life - my
friends don't feel that way either.
The jokes we made weren't about
our actual beliefs, they were about
making fun of crazy ideas concern-
ing women that could never be con-
sidered true in modern day.
The problem with these jokes,

as much as they may be facetious
in nature, is that they display the
nonchalant nature of lingering sex-
ism in society. I would be disgusted
with myself if I ever make jokes
about Latino or black stereotypes
the way I have about women. But
there should be no difference when
it comes to sex.
Living with Rachel taught me just
how bad these seemingly "harm-
less" jokes actually are. I would
make light of serious discrimina-
tion issues that still largely exist in
society, and not in a way that simply
made fun of them. Worse yet is that
I've noticed it's nearly impossible to
have a conversation with alot of my
friends about gender equality - it
just turns into jokes about women's
rights. No matter how serious or
reasonable I try to be, the concept of
feminism is simply no-go territory
for many conversations.
What I learned most from living
with Rachel is that when it comes
down to it, I would have to consider
myself a feminist. It's kind of an odd
thing to think of at first - a male
feminist - but my beliefs about gen-
der equality can't be described as
anything else. Plenty of other men
are probably feminists too, but, like
me, they have probably just never
explored the topic of women's rights.
Growing up, I was certainly
raised to believe in equality between
the sexes and respect for women.
This came from my parents. School
did very little to help my views on
gender. Feminism wasn't a topic we
discussed - ever. We weren't exact-
ly drilled on civil rights or equal-
ity in other respects, but at least we
addressed it. Gender equality was a
topic essentially never approached.
Not every young man was raised
the way I was. I had an incredibly
strong mother, a father who seri-
ously valued women's rights, and

my role model growing up was my
sister, who took on the best qualities
of both of my parents. College has
helped me to realize exactly how
rare my upbringing was.
Jokes about
women display
the nonchalant
nature of sexism.

The prevalence of sexual assault
on college campuses is hugely related
to men and our views ofwomenin the
big picture. I was lucky that my par-
ents fostered a great deal of respect
and empathy for women in me. As
I've made clear, this didn't mean I
turned out perfectly, but it certainly
helped. Ifayoungmanis raisedto see
women as objects - as inferiors that
are placed on earth for his and oth-
ers' use as they see fit - bad things
will happen. Most young men are
probably not from an overtly sexist
background, but as we all know, prej-
udice is a lot more complicated than
simple hatred or subjugation.
I've made a commitment to leave
anti-women jokes behind. It's hard
to break a lot of the bad habits I have
when it comes to women - hang-
ing out in a fraternity adds to that
challenge - but I couldn't live with
myself if I didn't try to overcome an
aspect of myself that has hurt oth-
ers. I'm a feminist, whether I like
it or not. It has nothing to do with
trying to be unique or radical. I'm
a feminist simply because I can't be
anythingless.

DANIEL WANG I
The economics of diversity

As a former high-school student of a small
Ohio town, I know the draw of football games
on Friday nights and the feeling of complete
dedication to my team, my school and my
town. Yet, as a former high-school student of
a small Ohio town who did not play football,
I also know of the treatment these athletes
received. Everything seemed to work out for
those students in the classroom due to their
involvement in the school's best-earning pro-
gram. Luckily, in my town this hero worship
never resulted in the turning of a blind eye to
major crimes. Unfortunately, this is not the
universal case. Drive two and a half hours
southeast of my hometown and you will reach
Steubenville, Ohio.
Steubenville - a small, football-crazed,
Rust Belt town - recently held trial for two
high-school football players, ages 16 and 17,
who both raped a drunken 16-year-old girl
at an end-of-the-summer party in 2012. The
facts of the case are disturbing to say the least.
The girl, while blacked out, was stripped of
her clothing, fingered by both boys (which
is defined as rape by Ohio law) and urinated
on. This nightmare continued the next morn-
ing when she woke up naked and without any
idea where she was. The victim found a pic-
ture of herself on Instagram that showed her
being held at the hands and feet by the boys
while passed out. Next was a 12-minute video
of the boys joking about the sexual assault and
her "dead" appearance. When questioned her
about the night before, she responded saying
that she "wasn't being a slut" but that instead
"they were taking advantage" of her. The two
boys - each standout players on their football
team - both plead guilty to the charges and
now face juvenile detention and registration
as sex offenders.
Even with the verdict, this story doesn't end.
Though the town allegedly attempted to cover
up the assault, the case still gained nationwide
coverage. As sickening as rape itself may seem,
the media's response may actually be more

disturbing. When the media broke the news
of the guilty verdict, CNN's Candy Crowley
mourned on television about the "promising"
career and lives of the perpetrators. Her col-
league, reporter Poppy Harlow, sympathized
with the crying boys at their sentencing. USA
Today's report repeats that the victim was
drunk. NBC News laments the boy's "prom-
ising football careers." Fox News reportedly
names the survivor but not the rapists. The
survivor has received numerous death threats
including some from fellow teenage girls.
Wait a minute - am I the only person sitting
here completely disgusted while reading the
coverage because I remembered that this girl
was raped? Does it need to be reiterated that
she was taken advantage of, against her will,
for two boys' entertainment? Is it fair to say
that the only people who ruined these boys' so-
calledpromisingcareerswerethemselveswhen
they decided to commit rape? Doesn't "no" still
mean "no" while unconscious? When I think
about Steubenville, the small, football-crazed
town, I can't help but equate it to the University
of Michigan, where football is king and where
we have experienced our own cover-ups, such
as the 2009 rape of a girl at an off-campus party
by a promising player of our football team that
seeningly evaporated as soon as the police
reports were filed.
That concerns me.
Regardless of how open-minded Ann Arbor
may seem, rape culture is evident here just like
anywhere else. I'm beginning to believe that
education is irrelevant to the cause - how do
you teach compassion? How do you take back
decades of blaming the victim for something
they in no way caused? How do you give survi-
vors of rape and sexual assault closure from the
guilt society has placed on them?
I don't know those answers and I'm start-
ing to be unsure that anyone does - and that
scares me.s
Olivia Kuenziv is an LSA fresh man.

The misplaced pride that the
University takes in the diversity
of its campus has begun to irk me.
The University's website gleefully
proclaims, "Diversity is integral to
Michigan's academic excellence."
Cool. The problem is recent data
contradicts Michigan's self-pro-
claimed role as a model of diversity.
The percentage of African-Amer-
ican students has dropped by five
percent since 2007, and the number
of Latino students has remained
stagnant despite being a fast grow-
ing percentage of the American
population. These percentages are
well below the national average of
13 percent blacks and 16 percent
Hispanics. In addition to these
shortcomings, the University has
further developed a sense of exclu-
sivity in a much less visible man-
ner: socioeconomic selectivity.
While racial diversity has been a
topic of public controversy with the
University's involvement in land-
mark legal cases regarding affirma-
tive action, financial diversity has
been relatively overlooked. In 2004,
more University freshmen came
from families making $200,000
or more than from families in the
whole lower half of the income dis-
tribution. This marked the crossing
of a significant financial threshold
at the University and was indica-
tive of an emergent trend. Over the
next four years, there was a 13-per-
cent drop in the number of students
coming from middle- to low-income

families - those that make $40,000
to $100,000. Aside from the usual
worrying of tuition increases,
there's an equally troubling concern
about the potential effects on stu-
dent and school achievement.
It can be argued that a university's
success is founded on its acceptance
of the most academically competi-
tive students while building a diverse
student body. And yet, the data has
continually shown that universi-
ties - including Michigan - have
been unfairly admitting a dispropor-
tional number of well-to-do kids. In
December of last year, The New York
Times reported on the growing dis-
parities between the rich and poor
in colleges across the country. Sev-
enty percent of students with high
standardized-test scores who came
from financially well-off families
were accepted to college and gradu-
ated. Only 26 percent of low-income
students with the same test scores
attended and graduated college.
Similar results have been found in
multiple studies.
What's more is that these reports
have shown this is a rapidly grow-
ing trend. By limiting the pool from
which the University draws its stu-
dents from, we're limiting the height
of our potential. The student body is
slowly becoming the best of the rich,
rather than the best of the best. With
the recent drops in low-income stu-
dents, the University's admissions
office isn't only failing to maintain a
financially diverse student body; it's

failingto uphold a meritocracy at an
institution based on the ideology of
merit-based achievement.
My biggest concern is the effect
of this on the culture on campus.
A diverse student body cultivates
open minds. The University itself
suggests that a "diverse cohort
of people and perspectives is key
to catalyzing such excellence."
Bringing together a wide range of
experiences exposes students to
rationales of thought alternative to
their own. Diversity breaks down
previously prejudiced and overly
simplistic understandings of dif-
ferent backgrounds. Expanding
one's perspective isn't only impor-
tant for a good education, it's cru-
cial to becoming an understanding
and compassionate person. Yet, as
the student body becomes increas-
ingly homogenous, I fear that we'll
begin to lose this quality.
While I occasionally find myself
annoyed with the indifference with
which some of my fellow class-
mates will drop $100 in a night
at the bar, sign $1,000 per month
away on leases or pay thousands of
dollars in fraternity and sorority
dues, these are only trivialities. I'm
truly worried that the University
is trending towards a day where it
will be so full of similarly-minded
students that not only will we not
be understanding of different peo-
ple, but we won't want to be.

LSA junior Jill Clancy, Momen-

and LSA junior Hayley Sakwa,

agreed that the role of the UC needs
to evolve in order to be effective.
Specifically, Clancy stated
the need for the addition of a
diversity council, which would
be comprised of student leaders
representing minority groups to
work with the UC.
All of the vice presidential
candidates except for LSA sopho-
more Chene Karega - the Defend

presidential candidate who did
not respond to a request for com- .
ment - also addressed the lack of
attendance for the UC. They said
with numerous meetings sport-
ing low attendance throughout
the past year, whoever takes the
reins must address this problem
immediately.
The candidates agreed that
more administrators need to be
present at UC meetings. Though
some, such as Coleman, have
attended, more are needed to
encourage UC members to attend,
Clancy said.

as an educational experiment that
would lastfor ayear orjust through
middle school. After getting more
involved in their local unschooling
movement, however, they found
the education reform to be the per-
fect venue to pursue Stephens' aca-
demic interests and expectations.
"Meeting all of these home-
schoolers and 'unschoolers' who
were homeschooling for academic
reasons provided a framework and
a vocabulary for an educational
mindset and philosophy that my
parents and I were trying to wrap
our heads around," Stephens said.
Stephen claimed unschooling is
a superior way to learn in compari-
son to public schooling. Venturing
beyond the domain of a conven-
tional K-12 education, he was able
to work on political campaigns,
help build a library in his home-
town and even work for a start-up
company in San Francisco.
"For the first time I was able to
do things that mattered," he said.
"I was able to have an impact on
what I was doing. I was able to
choose how, where, when and
why I was going to learn."
Standardized test statistics
show that homeschooled students
learn more than public-school
students. A 2008 study conduct-
ed by the Home School Legal
Defense Association found that
homeschooled students scored 72
points higher on the SAT and 1.8
points higher on the ACT than the
national average. It is also shown
that financial predispositions do
not significantly affect the suc-
cess of homeschooling; families
who spent less than $600 on edu-
cational materials and resources
scored in the 86th percentile
while families who spent more
than $600 scored in the 89th per-
centile of standardized tests.
After being unschooled until
the end of high school, Stephens
enrolled in Hendrix College in

Arkansas, which he attended for
six months before dropping out.
He said he felt disappointed in
himself on the first day of classes.
"I realized that I bought into
local maxima, that I didn't want
to be in a place where everyone
thought that they were the best,"
Stephens said. "I wanted to be in a
place where I was constantly being
challenged, where I was continu-
ing to learn and improve myself."
Stephens said he came to the
conclusion that the problem has to
do with the methods of education,
not the schools themselves, and
that the education that schools
are providing is not practical and
worth what it costs.
"It's time to take responsibility
for how we learn, for what we're
learning and for where it's going
to go," he said. "We're heading
towards a world where there are
opportunitiestolearnthatare more
meaningful and are less expensive
than going to a school or college."
Stephens said people are realizing
that a self-directed education is the
future, and this change is becoming
* increasingly relevant as the value of
college education diminishes.
"These things are happening
right now," Stephens said. "Col-
leges and schools and universities
everywhere are realizing if they
don't change their business mod-

even go because someone from
the administration won't be
there," she said.
Sakwa echoed these senti-
ments, adding that the UC is
strugglingto develop a true vision
for what the body should be.
"Having our leaders more
equipped to deal with conflict and
to manage change would be really
helpful for the University as a
whole," Sakwa said.
Another issue the candidates
addressed was how to better
facilitate not only undergraduate
students, but graduate students
as well. Though CSG, specifically
the UC, at times struggles to con-
nect with graduate students, the
candidates all agreed that they
would do more to change this.
Considering of the vice
presidential candidates are all
undergraduates, they all agreed
personal relationships would
need to be formed in order to
reach out and understand the
needs of graduate students.
Michaeli especially voiced this
sentiment because he said as a
freshman he would have numer-
ous years to develop relationships
and affect change within CSG.
For now, however, Sakwa thinks
the solution might be simple.
"I would bring cookies," Sakwa
said.
els, if they don't change the value
of education that they're offer-
ing students, cheaper and more
meaningful alternatives are going
to replace them."
Stephens said while writing his
book he found an amazing educa-
tion isn't solely gained through a
pricey college degree.
"(For my book I interviewed)
everyone from people who grew
up in the slum of Mumbai and
went on to become captains of
oil companies to people who
went to Oxford," he said. "There
seems to be absolutely no correla-
tion whether or not people came
from a privileged background and
whether or not they succeeded
outside of school."
The University is already tak-
ing an initiative to help students
design their own educational path.
Projects such as Flipped Semester,
where students can earn nine aca-
demic credits for pursuing self-
directed entrepreneurial projects,
are among these efforts.
Business senior Ryan Strauss,
a member of the University's
Flipped Semester commission
who attended the event, said
access to educational resources
through technology is an integral
part of this revolutionary educa-
tion reform. In effect, universities
are becoming outdated.
"I think before the Internet
became popular, Universitiesowere
hubs of knowledge, so people had
to come to a traditional institution
in order to obtain the best knowl-
edge from the best professors and
from the best books," Strauss said.
"But, now we are seeing a shift
where knowledge is really accessi-
ble. There are low barriers to entry
through startups such as Coursera
and Khan Academy ... Therefore,
universities are shifting from
becoming centers of knowledge
to facilitators of engaged learning
and entrepreneurial education."
Strauss also said there's a
movement among young students
to be able to design their own edu-
cation, and the credit system has

to be changed as a result.
"Universities are going to inev-
itably have to shift the way they
give out credits," he said. "Stu-
dents will be more able to actively
determine how they learn and
engage in their passions through
a self-directed education."
Engineering sophomore Natas-
ja Nielsen, a member of MPow-
ered, said interactive teaching
and more avenues for students to
pursue their interests is lacking in
the current education system.
"I think we definitely have to
have more dynamic teaching,
showing students how they can
find the things they enjoy and
take that further," Nielsen said.
LSA freshman Keegan Beljan-
ski said the rising cost of tuition
also needs to be addressed in any
future educational reforms.
LSAseniorSaraMillersaideducation

"I think every kid deserves
to have an education that's suit-
able to their needs and that is
adequate," Miller said. "I think
there is a lack of access to edu-
cation, to a quality education in
this country, and people need to
be working towards more equal-
ity and education that's tailored
more towards the needs of a wide
variety of learning abilities."

Joe was eerily silent. And then,
with under two minutes remain-
ing, the dagger plunged deep.
Racine, seeing Berenson wave
him over for an extra attacker,
started toward the bench. At
that moment, Notre Dame's Jeff
Costello picked off a pass and
skated toward the Michigan end.
Racine hesitated for a split second,
knowing that a goal would be the
end - the end of the game, the end
of the run, the end of the season.
He made his decision, sprinted
across the ice from the left circle

his shot. The dive was just a

DETROIT
From Page 1A
ects. DP Day is the largest event
the Detroit Partnership hosts
each year and the largest service-
learning day at the University.
This year, there were approxi-
mately 1,400 volunteers at 29
sites spread throughout Detroit
and surrounding areas. LSA
senior Phil Berkaw, major events
director for the Detroit Part-
nership, and LSA senior Kristin
Beharry, the group's executive
director, were in charge of orga-
nizing the event.
"We're not trying to fix the
city in a single day, at all. That's
not our goal nor is it really our
role to try to," Berkaw said. "We
really view it as an introduction
for students to Detroit, to see that
it's not maybe what the media
paints it across the country or
even by media outlets in Detroit,
and just to see the city for what it
truly is."
Planning for the event started
in December when sites were
contacted to see if they want-
ed to participate. When sites
were finalized, volunteers were
recruited. The event's total bud-
get sums to $35,000; the money
comes from various sources
includinggrants, corporate spon-
sors and multicultural organiza-
tions at the University."
"One of our huge funders is
Ford, they always donate a lot,"
Beharry said. "It's mainly Mich-
igan-based companies that want

to give back to the DP and to the
Detroit community in general."
VOLUNTEERS AT WORK
For Engineering graduate stu-
dent Darin McLeskey and Uni-
versity of Michigan-Dearborn
senior Tyson Gersh, the founders
of the Michigan Urban Farming
Initiative, DP Day has a special
significance: they met in 2011 at a
DP Day meeting.
"We both kept asking ques-
tions like 'Where's the agricul-
ture?' " Gersh said. "And then
we both found each other after-
wards and I was like 'Hey, you
asked a lot of questions about
agriculture and so did I."
At the MUFI site on Brush
Street, from afar it appeared that
students were standing in just
that - brush. Up close, it could be
seen that they were using pick-
axes, rakes and shovels to clear
the brush and clean up the space.
McLeskey said DP Day falls at
the beginning of their farming
season.
"It's a good way to get a lot
of people down here and really
clean up everything that's accu-
mulated over the winter, and it's
a good kick-off event," he said.
LSA sophomore Corey Walsh,
a participant at the site, said
early in the day he worked with
others to clear debris out of an
abandoned house so it could be
demolished.
"There's a lot of hope for the
city of Detroit left, and it just
takes a lot manpower to try to

reclaim it, and that's what we're
here tryingto do," Walsh said.
As Gersh was talking, three
volunteers approached him hold-
ing bullets they found while
cleaning out a house, a reminder
of the city's crime problem.
"You'll find lots of these,"
Gersh said.
At Artist Village, another
site, a group of students painted
murals on the outside of build-
ings.
One of the painters, LSA
sophomore Sarah Tiffany, said
she returned to participate in DP
Day for her second year because
of an experience she had the pre-
vious year while volunteering in
a park.
"All the homeless people came
and thanked us for cleaning up
their house, which made a huge
impact on me because you don't
really realize that," Tiffany said.
As the day came to a close, the
painters got a visit from former
Michigan football coach Lloyd
Carr. Carr has attended DP Day
for the past four years.
"I'mjustsoproudofall ofthese
students, they're awesome," Carr
said. "I've met literally hundreds
of students in these past four
years and I can see a difference in
the community, which is a beau-
tiful thing."
Carr got his first teaching job,
and subsequent coaching job, in
the Detroit Public School System,
which created his connection to
the city.
"Down through the years of
coaching at Michigan, I recruit-

ed this city, so I've had a lot of
friends from here, alot of players
I've coached," Carr said. "I think
the one thing we all have in com-
mon is that we love the city, and
so I'm just here to say thanks to
the students."
While students were paint-
ing, demolishing dilapidated
structures and yard work at sites
spread across the city, the day
looked quite different for Berkaw
and Beharry.
"I rarely get to see any of the
sites. In the four years that I've
done DP Day I've been to, like,
two sites," Berkaw said. "I'm
usually just taking phone calls
the whole time. There are points
where we'll be in a car all sitting
together and three people are on
the phone and I'm talking to two
people at once, it's wild."
At the end of the day, the vol-
unteers gathered in a park for a
rally. At the rally, students heard
from Carr, social justice activist
Yusef Shakur and rapper FowL.
Beharry said this year DP Day
was significant to her because of
the increased involvement with
the community.
"This year we've emphasized
the social justice and service
learning aspects of DP Day so
much more than in the past,"
Beharry said. "Which is some-
thing that I think is really going
to help our volunteers contextu-
alize what they're doing on DP
Day and will really help us work
towards our mission, which is
basically to break stereotypes
about Detroit."

Wish Foundation, which grants
wishes to children with life-
threatening illnesses.
"When I was little, aboutsix or
seven, I got my wish granted to
go to Disney World," Parten said.
The experience made her want to
give back to the program.
Jack Bernard, the University's
associate general counsel and chair
ofthecouncilfor disability concerns,
gave a speech about the acceptance
and inclusion of those with disabili-
ties intothe larger society.
"The challenge of disability is not
being able to have access to every-
thing, and we (only) make adjust-
mentsfor the norm," Bernard said.
He commended the members
of the fraternity for taking inter-
est in the issue of disabilities,
including installing a ramp and a
handicap-accessible bathroom in
their house.
In addition, Bernard suggest-

ed that they reach out to the Uni-
versity's Services for Students
with Disabilities office during
Greek Life recruitment to recruit
disabled students.
Social Work and Rackham
student Adena Rottenstein, a
member of Allies for Disability
Awareness, also spoke about the
importance of making students
feel comfortable registering with
the ADA and making society as a
whole more accepting of people
with disabilities.
Out of the 11 percent of disabled
students on a given college cam-
pus, only two or three percent
register with their school's office
for students with disabilities, even
though it can get them housing
and academic accommodations.
"What is disabling students
isn't the environment. It's the
stigma," Rottenstein said. "I
have fibromyalgia, so if I take
the stairs up just one flight I'm
in pain for about an hour. But if
I take the elevator up one floor, I
get dirty looks."

Rottenstein also remarked
that people on campus need to
adjust their day-to-day language
in order to be more accepting of
disabled individuals.
"How often do you hear some-
one say 'that's retarded' or 'lame'
or 'crazy'? This stigma is perva-
sive and accepted."
She recognized that much of
this isn't malicious, but that "the
most harmful behaviors on col-
lege campus is ignorance."
LSA sophomore Courtney
Green has a learning disability
that causes a dramatic discrep-
ancy between her actual IQ and
test taking scores. Because she
is registered with Services for
Students with Disabilities, she is

allowed extended time on exams,
which makes "a huge difference
in my studies and allowed me to
excel in my classes," she said.
Green lamented the fact that
students with disabilities at the
University choose to go with-
out such accommodations, but
applauded PiKappa Phi for taking
steps to break down the cultural
stigma surrounding disabilities.
"It is important to recognize
that you will never know what is
going on in someone's life," Green
said, "but whether they are strug-
gling with a visible disability or
a learning disability, or merely
going through a tough time in
their life they should be treated
with respect and consideration."

App to help partiers
'Stay in the Blue'

Students develop
app with UHS
to promote safe
drinking
By LIANA ROSENBLOOM
Daily StaffReporter
Stayingsafe during a night out?
There's an app for that.
LSA senior Steve Coffey is
one of three students working
to develop a "Stay in the Blue"
mobile application in partner-
ship with the University Health
System's alcohol safety program.
Beta testing began March 15, and
the app is expected to be available
for download by the end of the
semester.
Coffey previously worked with
UHS on a project for Filmic Pro-
ductions for the "Stay in the Blue"
program, and thought the app
would be a beneficial addition.
He also contacted another Filmic
Productions member, LSA senior
Roddy Hyduk, to help with design
and marketing.
"We're interested in tying the
message and the brandingctogeth-
er because the whole goal of both
pieces isto stay in the blue," Cof-
fey said.
Coffey said while he enjoyed
making videos and doing other
promotions for UHS, he's excited
for atangible, interactive product.
The app, which is still in devel-
opment, uses gender, weight,
drink variety and drink quantity
to calculate blood alcohol con-
centration over a given period of
time.
Users open the application and

are prompted to entertheir weight
and gender. They are then directed
to a beer-bottle-shaped gauge that
will monitor their drink intake.
LSA junior Jennifer Angell,
who worked with Coffey on the
project, said the idea started last
fall when they were given the
class assignment to develop a
smartphone app.
Once the user hits "Start,"
they can select from a list of
drinks that ranges from wine
and beer to local restaurant
specialty drinks. Each time the
user tells the app they've taken
anothrer drink it ecalculates
their BAC. As BAC increases,
the gauge adjusts - beginning
in the "blue," moving into "the
maize" and ultimately into "the
red." As time passes, the app
will appropriately adjust the
BAC level as alcohol dissipates.
The app also has a link to the
ToDoInA2 website, as well as a
list of names and phone numbers
of six popular Ann Arbor cab
companies. Angell said when it's
officially released, it will be free
to download. She hopes it will be
incorporated into the University's
existing smartphone application.
Nursing junior Shelby Epstine
is one of the beta testers for the
application. She used the app on
Saturday and said she had a good
experience.
"It would definitely be some-
thingbthat I would promote in the
Greek community as a good way
to have in your hand your level
of alcohol and when you need to
slow down, or when you are at a
good pace," Epstine said.
Angell and Coffey both said
they are looking forward to get-
ting feedback from the 30 beta

testers over the next few weeks.
They hope the app was used dur-
ing St. Patrick's Day celebrations
and that they will be able to make
even more improvements in the
weeks to come.
Hyduk said there is still alot of
work to be done with the inter-
face design and marketing of the
app, but he's excited to continue
perfecting the project.
Hyduk said he thinks in order
for programs such as "Stay in the
Blue" to be effective, students
need to play an active role in their
promotion.
"I think it's important that
students are involved in produc-
ing this content and delivering
this messaging," he said. "With-
out a student voice in this work,
it's really hard to drive home this
kind of messaging."
Hyduk added that he is glad
to be a part of bringing this new
smartphone app technology
together with an important Uni-
versity program.
"I think this project is kind of
the pinnacle of what a student
could deliver for the program
because it is so cutting edge," he
said.
Marsha Benz, an alcohol and
other drug educator at UHS, ini-
tially helped to develop the "Stay
in the Blue" campaign.
"I absolutely love it when stu-
dents come to us," Benz said.
"The more students own 'Stay in
the Blue' and make it their own,
it's going to get out to students
better. It's coming from students
for students, and I think it is just
brilliant."

State Department
believes flights are
ferrying weapons,
fighters to Syria
BAGHDAD (AP) - Just days
after the 10th anniversary of
the U.S. invasion of Iraq, U.S.
Secretary of State John Kerry
confronted Baghdad for con-
tinuing to grant Iran access
to its airspace and said Iraq's
behavior was raising questions
about its reliability as a part-
ner.
Speaking to reporters dur-
ing a previously unannounced
trip to Baghdad, Kerry said that
he and Iraqi Prime Minister
Nouri al-Maliki had engaged in
"a very spirited discussion" on
the Iranian flights, which U.S.
officials believe are ferrying
weapons and fighters intended
for the embattled Syrian gov-
ernment.
Kerry said the plane ship-
ments - along with material
being trucked across Iraqi ter-
ritory from Iran to Syria -
were helping President Bashar
Assad's regime cling to power
by increasing their ability to
strike at Syrian rebels and
opposition figures demanding
Assad's ouster.

"I made it very clear that for
those of us who are engaged in
an effort to see President Assad
step down and to see a demo-
cratic process take hold ... any-
thing that supports President
Assad is problematic," Kerry
said at a news conference at the
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad after
meeting separately with Maliki
at his office. "And I made it very
clear to the Prime Minister that
the overflights from Iran are, in
fact, helping to sustain Presi-
dent Assad and his regime."
The overflights in Iraq have
long been a source of conten-
tion between the U.S. and Iraq.
Iraq and Iran claim the flights
are carrying humanitarian
goods, but American officials
say they are confident that the
planes are being used to arm
the support the Assad regime.
The administration is warning
Iraq that unless action is taken,
Iraq will be excluded from the
international discussion about
Syria's political future.
U.S. officials say that in the
absence of a complete ban on
flights, Washington would at
least like the planes to land and
be inspected in Iraq to ensure
that they are carrying humani-
tarian supplies. Former Secre-
tary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton secured a pledge from
Iraq to inspect the flights last

year, but since then only two
aircraft have been checked by
Iraqi authorities, according to
U.S. officials.
One senior U.S. official trav-
eling with Kerry said the sheer
number of overflights, which
occur "close to daily," along
with shipments trucked to
Syria from Iran through Iraq,
was inconsistent with claims
they are only carrying humani-
tarian supplies. The official
said it was in Iraq's interest to
prevent the situation in Syria
from deteriorating further,
particularly as there are fears
that al-Qaida-linked extrem-
ists may gain a foothold in the
country as the Assad regime
falters.
The official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because
the official was not autho-
rized to speak publicly on the
matter, said there are, clear
links between al-Qaida linked
extremists operating in Syria
and militants who are also car-
rying out terrorist attacks in
Iraqi territory with increasing
regularity.
Kerry's comments in Bagh-
dad come as U.S. lawmakers
are calling for President Barack
Obama to do more to stop the
bloodshed in Syria, includ-
ing possible airstrikes against
Assad's aircraft fleet.

The rewards of
reading

No narrative in 'Stoker'

here's something inher-
ently solitary and all-
encompassing in a book.
You go to the movies to
indulge in over-buttered pop-
corn and
whispered
exchanges
with the
gaggle of
people who
tagged along
because "that
one scene ANNA
with that girl SADCKsiAYA
from 'Prin-
cess Diaries'
looks brutal." And then there's
the rest of the theater, each
couple of seats their own cos-
mos, trying to stay unaware of
neighbors across the row.
TV can be lonely, especially
if it's a Saturday night and the
rest of your housemates are
at a house party while you
decided to stay in because it's
almost April and going outside
is depressingly freezing. So, it's
off to Netflix and its collection
of shows. And then it's probably
a bit of texting or Snapchatting
your friends to let them know
you're warm and have "Gossip
Girl" reruns on.
There's no texting and read-
ing. There's no turning away
from the pages to have a quick
discussion about the main
character's hair. Delving into a
book means being taken to its
universe, one where you leave
everyone else you know behind.
And when the book is fin-
ished, it's like coming back from
the dead - resurfacing, only to
find six hours have gone by and
the world is different. It's dark
out, and there are no lights on
except for the little book light,
and somehow, no one has both-
ered to make dinner.
Reading requires a specific
patience: It might take a while
to pick the story up, introduce
all the characters and dra-
matize the plot. It might take
centuries for the protagonist to
get to the bottom of an evil plot.
Authors of series are the best
marketing strategists, leaving
you hanging with just enough
information to keep you from
perpetually sobbing. Patience is
such a slutty virtue, and books
tease the persistence of many
readers.
Comparing TV, film and
reading is sort of unnecessary.
Because what's the point of hav-
ing a winner? There's nothing a
book can do to provide the same
level of sensory overload as an
IMAX 3-D movie experience.
There's nothing a TV show can
do to seamlessly weave each
storyline and episode into an
hour-long episode the way a
500-page novel can. But there's

nothing to stop anyone from
indulging in all three.
Movies, TV, books and music
are art - different styles, dif-
ferent formats, but all essen-
tially made with the purpose of
entertainment. I don't want to
argue against all other forms of
media, insisting that literature
is the only safe route towards
becoming properly cultured.
In a culture with high-speed
Internet, that seems impracti-
cal.
But there's something nov-
els offer that no other type of
entertainment can, and that's
the total engulfment of your
life into another. Since reading
relies so heavily on the reader
to create the sounds, the smells
and the people in another
world, it becomes your own cre-
ation. It's paralyzing; watching
people read for hours at a time
is unimaginably boring.
It's unfortunately less com-
mon to find people with their
noses in a book, and even less so
for pleasure than off a syllabus.
You can truly
lose yourself in
the universe of
a book.
Chapter-by-chapter read-
ing is pretty common for the
assigned-reading few who
actually complete the assign-
ment. But it's dull, and lacks
imagination - getting ripped
from its universe every 70 pages
doesn't help. Who has time to
read a full novel, though? Who
has time to sit through endless
page-turning?
It's about a delicate balance.
It's about quality over quan-
tity. And when you finally find
enough time to dedicate, the
novel better be rewarding and
satisfying - it should change
your world. Rather than cut-
ting out reading, it's time to sift
through the mediocre writing
and focus on the truly worth-
while.
Just like picking a TV series
or a movie, choosing a book
can take a while. It might not
mesh with your style; the writ-
ing could be too leaden for
the Saturday you've set aside
for reading. So continue your
search! Because there are truly
remarkable experiences waiting
for you on the other side of book
covers.

Park's psychosexual
thriller lacks
humanity
By MATT EASTON
Daily Arts Writer
"Stoker" disorients. After the
first opening segments - drifting
memories and fragments of nois-
es - one might
beseechingly
reach out an
arm for support, Stoker
or for a tangible
detail to provide AtState
some basis for Fox Searchlight
understanding.
But alas, this
would be a fruitless task. "Stoker"
brushes aside coherence of narra-
tive and stability in favor of flour-
ishes of the camera and a sense of
the eerie. The moments of clarity,
while few and far between, prove
that "Stoker" could've been one of
the movies of the year, but ulti-
mately, the clutter overwhelms.
In a word, "Stoker" tries. The
script, penned by Wentworth
Miller ("Prison Break"), strives
to intrigue with a story (actually,
story might be too coherent for
"Stoker"; it's more of an idea) of
incestuous, erotic murderthemes.
India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska,
"Lawless") loses her father in a
tragic accident; she's moody and
strange. Her mother (Nicole Kid-
man, "The Paperboy") seems to
get over the death quickly; creepy,
charming Uncle Charlie (Mat-
thew Goode, "Watchmen") moves
in with the two after "traveling
the world." What follows is a lot
of hinting at menace. There's ten-
sion, but it ultimately adds up to
the movie pleasuring itself.

"Just let me braid your hair."
Miller attempts the provoca-
tive, but his dialogue and meta-
phors move between utterly
obvious and horribly clunky.
As Charlie "hunts," a TV in the
background shows a nature pro-
gram on eagles in which they
"kill their own family" to ensure
their own survival. Hints like
this don't only induce groans of
"duh," but they also thrust the
audience out of the movie. It
becomes apparent that someone
wrote this film.
Moments between the fam-
ily at the dinner table also strain
credibility. It makes sense that
the tension and unhinged nature
of Uncle Charlie might make
small talk difficult - but it's
hard not to wonder, "Have these
people ever said normal things
outside of the context of poorly
shielding underlying motives
and emotional/sexual turmoil?"

Probably not, because the char-
acters in "Stoker" don't embody
human emotions.
Despite all this, "Stoker" com-
pels in small ways and begins to
find some solid ground toward
the final act. Details of Uncle
Charlie are squirmy in all the
right ways, and Goode plays the
character with occasional depth.
His long belt (and the leather
slide of him slipping it off his
pants) is legitimately frightening,
and the piano scene that Goode
shares with Wasikowska is slimy
and wonderful and gross - it's an
uncomfortable (and erotic) dis-
play that shows how good "Stok-
er" can be.
Director Chan-wook Park
("Oldboy") stifles the early
scenes, but eventually gives the
film more space and sets up some
awesome moments. The colors
he adds accentuate the overall

mood, and some of his transitions
show real ingenuity. Park was
obviously playing with the film,
tryingnew things. In a sense, this
defines "Stoker," but it may have
been refreshing to havea steadier
hand control the movie, espe-
cially because the foundation of
"Stoker" is already so creaky.
Family, what it means and
what it makes us - this is the
main idea behind "Stoker." The
climax centers on that question,
and at the height of the film's
tension, a mad-eyed Kidman
whispers: "You were supposed
to love me, weren't you?" It's a
heartbreaking appeal, one that
nearly salvages "Stoker," almost
convinces us that some humanity
exists amid the miasma of men-
ace and confusion that inundates
the rest of the movie. But one line
can't lift an entire narrative -
"Stoker" proves that.

By ELLIOT ALPERN
Senior Arts Editor
Before entering college, I'd
only played one game of "FIFA"
in my life, a match I was coerced
into entering by a friend on our
high school's soccer team. Even
though I, like a growing majority
of today's youth, actually played
soccer in elementary school, I
quickly realized that Ihad no idea
what I was doing. I faintly recall
collecting three or four red cards
by the end of our match and was
never invited to play again.
To be honest, I didn't really
care - though a number of my
high-school friends played some
iteration of the "FIFA" franchise
after school, I stuck to other clas-
sics: "Call of Duty," "NHL," per-
haps even "Mario Kart" or "Super
Smash Bros." I never expected to
see or play the soccer game again.'
That lasted until my freshman
year at Michigan, when a room-
mate (and growing pressure from
the other Oxford dormmates)
coerced me to pick up the control-
ler.
It was a hard few months, but
slowly I learned - I'd say now, as
a junior, I'm ... OK. It's hard to tell
when playing against the same
opponent rotation.
But I'm still astonished by how
many gamers - or, at least, sports
gamers - list "FIFA" as one of, if
not the most played games in their
dorms. It's pervasive as a unify-
ing form of entertainment in the
college-age demographic - and
at that, it's immensely popular as
a stand-alone video game.
In the current gaming industry,
sports games have grown from a
niche to a major chunk of the mar-
ket: Three of the 10 best-selling
games of last year were sports
games, and "Madden NFL 13" fol-
lowed only "Call of Duty: Black
Ops II" as the second-biggest
moneymaker of the year. "FIFA
13" ended up rounding out that list
at No. 10, with Take-Two's "NBA
2K13" floating in between at No.
6. So, it makes sense that - con-

sidering what appeals to college brought international soccer to
kids - games like "Madden" and an American audience. According

The Wolverines (12-6 Big Ten,
28-7 overall) closed the first half
on an 11-2 run to take a 15-point
lead into halftime and didn't
look back. After the teams trad-
ed buckets in the second half's
opening minutes, Michigan -
led by the intensity of freshman
forward Mitch McGary- proved
to be too much for VCU and its
vaunted pressure defense to
handle.
McGary, an animal all day
inside the paint and on the
glass, finished with a game and
career-high 21 points on 10-of-
11 shooting and a career-high

14 rebounds. His 34 minutes
were also a career high. Mean-
while, Burke and junior guard
Tim Hardaway Jr. played with
a poised demeanor, often break-
ing through the Rams' full-court
pressure, nicknamed "Havoc,"
with ease. Burke recorded 18
points and seven assists, while
Hardaway finished with 14.
From the get-go, it was obvi-
ous McGary's energy would be
the difference, and he was quick
to note that it extends beyond
just the stat sheet.
"Everybody feeds off it,"
McGary said. "Everybody start-
ed feeling it, and we just kept it
going.
"Our team was having fun out
there. Everyone was feeding off
each other and it was really ener-
getic.... I feel like we wanted ita
bit more."
While many pundits assumed
the Wolverines would struggle
to keep pace with VCU - espe-
cially after the Rams bea
their second-round oppo-
nent, Akron, by 46 points
on Thursday - it was
VCU (12-4 Atlantic
10, 27-9 overall) who
looked out of sorts.
Michigan outscored
the Rams 15-4 in
transition and
scored 17 points of
of turnovers, com-
pared to VCU's 10.
Freshman forward
Glenn Robinson
III found himself
open in transition
all day long, chipping
in 14 points and nine
boards.
Despite what the
experts said, the Wolver-
ines knew they play their
best basketball when they're
able to get into transition and'
play in space. After watching
VCU during Friday's film ses-
sion, several Michigan players
noted thatthey felt confident that
if they could break the press, that

they'd have a field day.
"Once we saw their type of
pressure, we knew that their
defense could turn into our
offense," Burke said. "We knew
that we didn't necessarily have
to run alot of half-court sets just
because if we break the press,
we're going to have numbers, and
that's what we did."
The Wolverines dominated the
rebounding battle, 41-24, includ-
ing 17 offensive boards. Theyalso
shot 52 percent, including 55.2
percent in the second half as they
continued to widen the margin.
Throughout the game, the
Wolverines' bench looked to
be having as much fun as it did

Hello, Mitch Mc Gary

AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -
Jordan Morgan has been
the starting center for this
Michigan basketball team
for three years. Besides junior
forward Tim Hardaway Jr., he
has been around longer than any
member of the starting lineup.
Out of Michigan's 32 games
this year, the redshirt junior
started 27 of them. He was
lauded for beingthe defensive
captain in the middle, the under-
rated key to the Wolverines' suc-
s. His stats were
ever over-
whelm-

- averaging around five points
and five rebounds a game - but
Michigan, especially on defense,
didn't look the same without
him.
Yet in Michigan's 78-53 win
over Virginia Commonwealth on
Saturday, the win that pushed
Michigan to its first Sweet Six-
teen appearance since 1994,
Morgan didn't play a single min-
ute, and that
was the right
decision.
Saturday,
againstthe
Rams, the
Wolverines
needed the
man who has EVERETT
een back- COOK
ngup
organ
ost of the year. They
eeded their behemoth,
heir human lightning
od, the man known
ore for his energy
nd crowd-pleasing
ntics than his
ctual play.
They needed
reshman forward
itch McGary,
who did things to
the Rams' front-
court that Michi-
gan hasn't seen all
season. This game
was supposed to be
about VCU's "Havoc"
defense, and the guard
play that goes along with
it. In a way, it was, but it was
also about McGary's emer-
gence on a national stage.
In November, he was more
of a caricature of a post player.
There were moments of athletic
brilliance, when you shook your
head and wondered how some-

body 6-foot-10 could move that
gracefully.
He was a fan favorite early,
known for waving his arms and
diving for loose balls more than
post moves or points.
Reminders that he hadn't
pieced it all together would
appear - a missed dunk here, a
slipped defensive rotation there.
He had the tools, but hadn't
showcased it in a complete game.
Then Saturday happened -
the emergence of "Hercules,"
at least according to Michigan
assiStant coach Baccari Alex-
ander.
He played 34 minutes, scoring
21 points on 10-of-11shooting
while pulling down 14 rebounds.
Every single one of those num-
bers is a career-high.
Right from the get-go,
McGary's energy and intensity
set the tone, muscling his way
around a defender for a big dunk
less than two minutes into the
game. He was all over the court,
finding open seams in the fast
break and using his bigbody for
offensive put backs all afternoon.
The double-double came just a
couple minutes into the second
half, on a play where McGary
put back an offensive rebound,
got fouled and made the free
throw.
After the game, VCU for-
ward Juvonte Reddic said that
McGary outworked him in the
game. Plain and simple.
There were stretches in
November when that would have
been tough for McGary to sus-
tain over 34 minutes of play - he
would look gassed after four-
minute spans on the court.
"He came in weighing in the
250s, ballooned up a little bit,

as well. That only intensified as its
lead grew larger, and was capped
by five of Michigan's seniors, typi-
cally reserves, playing the game's
final minute.
"This was a lot of fun," Robin

After opening with severa
slows starts throughout the past
two months, the Wolverines
opened with an intensity on both
ends that's been missing in many
of its previous big games. After
the Rams jumped out to a 2-0
lead, Michigan responded with
the next six points.

defensive end and on the glass

lier in the season, but nothing as
refined as the Rams' press.
VCU ranks first in the coun-
try in turnovers forced per game
(11.8) while the Wolverines are
top in the nation in protecting
the ball, averaging just 9.2 turn-
overs per game. After watch-
ing VCU easily rattle Akron on
Thursday, Michigan knew it had
to beat the press early.
"If we could beat the press, we
knew we'd have a leg up because
we're a great transition team,"
said redshirt sophomore Jon
Horford. "Once they take the
layups away, we have kick-outs.
You can't contain it early, it ends
up being a weakness early."
All Michigan had to do to get
around the Rams' pressure was
outrun them. Ideally, sophomore
point guard Trey Burke brought
the ball up the court - he would
simply outrun his defender - but
if VCU would trap Burke, a quick
pass to junior guard Tim Hard-
away Jr. or freshman guard Nik
Stauskas would allow the Wol-
verines to set up their half-court
offense.

But Burke faltered against the
Havoc a bit in the second half.
The sophomore had three con-
secutive turnovers to start the
second stanza and the Wolver-
ines and was exhausted from the
fast-paced play of both teams.
Albrecht played the majority of
his minutes in the second half
- he played a career-high 15
minutes on Saturday - and the
transition between Burke and
Albrecht running the point was
seamless.
Albrecht said the coaches told
him that he would have to be
ready to have an increased role
against VCU, and Albrecht said
both him and the coaches were
prepared to break the press.
"That was the one outlier we
knew we had in here against the
press," said Michigan coach John
Beilein. "With the one day's rest,
with the attention, I mean, those
guards are really good at turning
people over, and just stealing the
ball from you. So we knew Trey
could not handle that the whole
day.... That was huge for Spike to
be able to come in and just give
him some rest. He did a wonder-
ful job."

for the rest of this Tournament.
That much was clear.
"It's a big change to make,
and it's a big sacrifice on the
part of many with Jordan and
Jon," said Michigan assistant
coach Lavall Jordan. "ButI
really do think our guys are
selfless guys. It's all about the
team, whatever the coaches
decide."
On Saturday, and likely for
the rest of March, they decided
on Hercules.
"Sometimes we joke about
them guys being in the Justice
League," Alexander said. "If
Trey Burke is Batman and Tim
is Robin, I tell you what, Mitch
McGary might be Hercules.
"That type of presence is
something that's been needed
in our program and something
we probably haven't seen since
the 94s."

Freshman goalie
bails out the
defense, faces 33
shots on Sunday
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
DETROIT - When the clock
reached triple zeroes and the
reality of the Michigan hockey
team's 3-1 loss to Notre Dame in
the CCHA Championship game
finally started to sink in, senior
captain A.J. Treais went over to
freshman goalie Steve Racine.
He was the first teammate
that Treais saw, but Treais knew
that Racine would need a little
extra consolation after the game
- the goalie was carrying the
weight of the team's loss on his
shoulders.
Treais later said that Michi-
gan wouldn't have been in the
game if it weren't for Racine.
And though Racine is certainly
part of the reason for the Wol-
verines' appearance in the
CCHA finals, he was also the
reason why Michigan was able
to stay in the game.

The game was close until it
wasn't. Though the score was
knotted at one entering the final
period, the Wolverines were
outshot, out-chanced and out-
played for the remainder of the
game. The Fighting Irish's go-
ahead goal came less than 30
seconds into the final frame, and
the Wolverines couldn't gener-
ate enough offensive opportuni-
ties to match it.
But until that point, Michigan
managed to skate with Notre
Dame. And the team can thank
Racine for that.
Playing in what Michigan
coach Red Berenson called his
goalie's "best game of the sea-
son," Racine faced a total of 33
Notre Dame shots and came
up with the big saves during
the first two periods to stymie
an aggressive Fighting Irish
offense.
"(Racine) was sharp, good for
him," Berenson said. "We need-
ed that and any time a team out-
shoots you like that in the first
period, you've got to be ready
and he was ready."
The emergence of Racine as
Michigan's first choice behind
the crease for the last 10 games
has been unexpected to say the

least, considering his less-than-
ideal start for the Wolverines in
the first two months of the sea-
son in which he gave up an aver-
age of over three goals per game.
The Fighting Irish outshot
Michigan, 18-6, in the first
frame, a period which was
almost exclusively played in the
Wolverines' zone. Though the
defense took extra care to care-
fully clear the puck and limit
the number of turnovers in front
of the net, Racine was there to
catch the mistakes, including
corralling his own rebounds.
But if Racine was tested in
the first period by a constant
peppering of shots from Notre
Dame, then it became even more
evident in the second frame
when Michigan took three pen-
alties.
For the second consecutive
game, the Wolverines scored
shorthanded. Junior forward
Derek DeBlois tallied his third
shorthanded goal of the year,
tying him for second in the
country.
But perhaps more important
than the offensive chances gen-
erated by the penalty kill was the
way it stepped up defensively.
Berenson always says that a

team's best penalty killer is its
goalie, and though Racine made
the penalty kill's life easier by
coming up with the big saves,
the unit in turn tried to lessen
Racine's load by stepping up its
level of play.
"I think guys just getting
in front of shots and playing
desperate hockey," said senior
forward Kevin Lynch on the
penalty-kill unit's performance.
"We're just trying to get in
front of shots to take some of
the heat off Steve. If you block a
shot, sometimes you can catch a
break. We had a couple of those."
With a little more than a min-
ute left in the game and Michi-
gan down by one, Racine looked
to the bench. He saw the signal
and skated off the ice, so the
Wolverines could try and find an
equalizer with an extra attacker.
But as he was halfway
towards the bench, Notre Dame
gained possession of the puck
and skated into Michigan's zone.
Racine saw what was happening
and skated back to the crease for
dear life in a last-ditch effort to
try and stop the empty-net goal.
And Racine, who hadn't
missed a beat all game, was a few
paces too short.

"I had seen she was throwing
first-pitch strikes so when I went
up there, I knew to be aggres-
sive," Sweet said. "Out of all of
my at-bats, I felt like that was the
one where I was ready to go."
Down 7-2 in the fifth inning,
the Wolverines threatened sev-
eral times with the bases loaded,
but were held to two runs off a
single from senior second base-
man Ashley Lane. She came
through again in her next at-
bat, driving a sixth-inning pitch
into the right-field grandstand
to plate Blanchard and Romero,

tying the game at seven.
"(Offense) is a huge thing for
us this year," Sweet said. "We
have offense and defense. It was
great to see that fight today."
Added Hutchins: "It's been the
theme of our season, everybody
contributing. Blanchard and oth-
ers stepped up big today. Caitlin
has been working hard this, she's
been trying to get her swing big-
ger, and I was really excited for
her."
Despite an early 5-0 hole, the
Wolverines paired a six-run fifth
inning with four runs in the sixth
to secure the 13-5 mercy rule

victory. Though Wagner would
make an early exit of her own in
the fifth inning - with Driesenga
coming on in relief - the offense
had an answer for Purdue in the
bottom of the inning.
Freshman left fielder Sierra
Lawrence was the spark in the
fourth inning, splitting the out-
fielders for a two-out, two-run
double. She finished the com-
back with an RBI single to force
the mercy-rule walk-off in six
innings. In the inning, Romero
contributed her third home run
of the weekend - her 11th of the
season - to dead center field in

the fifth.
The story was much simpler
on Friday afternoon, and much
more chocolatey, as the Wol-
verines needed just five innings
and eight runs to shut out the
Boilermakers. In keeping with
her tradition of M&M giveaways
to home run hitters, Hutchins
had to give away three packs of
M&Ms to home-run hitting play-
ers as they rounded third base.
Romero had her second multi-
home run game while Blanchard
hit her first homer since April 2,
201L
"You could see the kids were

excited to be out there today,"
Hutchins said. "I think being at
home, especially the kids who've
been in the program, realize how
special it is to play at Alumni
Field. And we're contagious.
Sierragave us some energy with
that big swing in the first inning,
and they all caught it."
An offense that has relied pri-
marily on Romero will have to
catch fire on its own moving for-
ward in Big Ten play. For at least
this weekend at Alumni Field,
contagion contributed to the
Wolverines' 29 runs and seven
home runs in 18 innings.

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
In a season filled with accom-
plishments, the Michigan wom-
en's basketball team added a new
highlight to put atop its resume
on Sunday night. For the first
time since 2001, the Wolverines
won a game in the NCAA Tour-
nament and now find themselves
matched up against lethal No. 1
seed Stanford.
In a 60-52 win over Villanova
(9-7 Big East, 21-11 overall), it was
clear Mich-_
igan came VILLANOVA 52
out erratic MICHIGAN 60
and excited,
struggling to finish on several
early shots in the paint while
starting out shooting 4-for-14.
The Wolverines' defense held
down the fort, grabbing a 13-10
lead and forcing three early
Wildcat turnovers before senior
guard Jenny Ryan scored nine
straight points for Michigan (9-7
Big Ten, 22-10) to build a seven-
point lead.
"I thought we did a great
job. offensively on them, and I
thought we did a great job of
getting (Laura) Sweeney in foul
trouble and obviously that was a
key to the game," said Michigan
coach Kim Barnes Arico. "She
scored their first seven points.
They worewus down a littleabit
late, but we were really able
to take advantage of their size
inside. I thought (senior center)
Rachel (Sheffer) was tremen-
dous.
"It came down to the end, and
we're happy to be playing one
more day."
Villanova, which is seventh in
the country with 8.3 3-pointers
per game, came out flat beyond
the arc, starting 1-for-8. The
Wildcats went into halftime hav-
ing hit only three 3-pointers, but
besides a nine-point run from
Ryan, the Wolverines had a slop-
py first half offensively. Michi-
gan went into halftime with six

turnovers, while Villanova had
four of its own, and both teams
hit under 40 percent of their
shots.
"I think just keeping our com-
posure was huge," Ryan said.
"Even if they got the lead, I was
feeling good about our team,
especially the way we were talk-
ing to each other in the huddle.
Obviously any time a team does
get a lead, it's abit demoralizing,
but what we talked about the
whole time is that if they score
we need to score, and just need
to get one stop at a time."
Clinging to their two-point
lead, the Wolverines came out
strong behind Sheffer's layup
that sparked a 9-0 run to stretch
their lead to nine. Sheffer ended
the game with 16 points and
matched her career-high 13
rebounds.
"Even if they
got the lead, I
was feeling good
about our team."
Five straight points from Vil-
lanova cut Michigan's momen-
tum, but senior forwardRate
Thompson drilled a 3-pointer
with 12:43 remaining to bring
the Wolverines' lead backto five.
Thompson ended the game with
a team-high 17 points and six
rebounds.
"I think the momentum
change was really big for us,"
Sheffer said. "Whenever Kate
hits a three, it's always a huge
momentum change because it's
usually a great shot, so I think it
just really set us off to keep the
energy going for us."
After back and forth from both
teams, the Wildcats' sophomore
forward Lauren Burford had the

opportunity for a four-point play
to tie the game, but missed the
free throw with 7:56 remaining.
"We knew they were going to
make runs, and we knew they
were going to score," Ryan said.
"(But) we just tried to stick to
our runs and what we practiced
all week."
Michigan responded with a
three-point play from Sheffer,
pulling its lead back to four. With
4:24 left in the contest,fVillanova
came out of a timeout commit-
ting a huge turnover that result-
ed in Thompson's third 3-pointer
of the game.
A strong run to follow sealed
the Wolverines' win, bringing
their largest lead of the game
to 10. Michigan committed 14
turnovers, but outrebounded the
Wildcats, 36-25.
"I think we knew going into
the game the style that they
have," Sheffer said. "They do
shoot a lot of threes, so we had
to take advantage of crashing the
boards and getting out in transi-
tion. I think I had a double-dou-
ble (tonight), but I was just in the
right place at the right time for a
lot of those rebounds."
Ryan ended the game with
13 points and three assists, and
senior forward Nya Jordan also
played a critical role, adding 12
points and nine rebounds. The
Wolverines found success from
the foul line too, going 11-for-13
from the charity stripe.
The most glaring weakness for
Michigan this season has been its
bench, which was held scoreless
on Sunday. Michigan will need
to find some form of production
from its bench to compete with
Stanford on Tuesday night.
"We need our seniors to carry
us in the end," Ryan said. "We
have Kate Thompson on our
team who can light it up, and we
have Rachel and Sam Arnold and
anybody.
"I just think we kept our com-
posure really well tonight, and
we can do it (again)."

4C1 The Streak, March 25, 2013


B +!!!B

-..U -~

They broke the streak but went down swinging

DETROIT -
Jeff Jackson woke up the
morning of March 10 and
exhaled.
The Notre Dame coach checked
the score of the previous night's
game between
Michigan State
and Alaska,
saw that the
Spartans had
survived, and
let out one
massive sigh of
relief. M 'ATT
Michigan SLOVIN
State's win,
stretching into
the wee hours
of Monday morning, meant that
his Fighting Irish would avoid
playing Michigan in the CCHA
quarterfinals.
Jackson was relived then. He's
relieved now. Nobody wanted
to play Michigan - not in the
quarterfinals, not in the finals,
not in the NCAA Tournament,
where the Wolverines would have
landed with a win in Sunday's
title game.
The Fighting Irish dodged a
bullet in Fairbanks. They dodged
a more dangerous one on Sunday.

Jacob Trouba stopped the puck,
tantalizingly close to crossing the
goal line for Miami (Ohio) fans,
gravely near it for Michigan fans,
calmly with his stick. That puck
would've crossed a few short
months ago.
And had Trouba arrived to the
puck a split-second later in the
first period of Saturday's CCHA
semifinal against the RedHawks,
Michigan might not have reached
Sunday's stage where the Wolver-
ines faced an all-or-nothing game
for the ages.
Win, or the 22-year NCAA
Tournament appearance streak -
the one that predates the birth of
all but two of Michigan's players
- would be over.
After one shaky, how-did-that-
not-go-in first period, the Wol-
verines came out in the second
period and took the pressures that
come with manning a program so
accustomed to postseason success
and shoved them down the Red-
Hawks' throats.
Somewhere along the way,
Michigan redeemed itself, Coach
Red Berenson said he began to see
a change in early February, when
the Wolverines played at Notre

Dame. The signs of improvement
were there, but the results weren't
- Michigan gave up 13 goals on
the weekend and was swept.
This weekend, the Wolverines
held two of the best offenses in
the CCHA to two goals apiece,
minus an empty-netter.
This hockey-loving university
didn't yet forgive them after that
February series for a season that
was, more often than not, misera-
ble. Perhaps for some, that forgive-
ness didn't come until Trouba's
play, an overwhelming display of
grit that signified just how far the
Wolverines have truly come.
Notre Dame was clearly the
better team Sunday. This time,
there was no way around it for the
Fighting Irish - they were playing
Michigan. And they couldn't have
made things harder on the Wol-
verines, controlling play for much
of the afternoon.
Inevitably, this team will be
known as the one that broke the
streak. When the pride and joy
of the program expired after
Sunday's 3-1 heartbreaker, that
became reality.
But because of the turnaround
that nobody saw coming, nobody
will blame them for that. After all,
Michigan won't be gone from the

NCAA Tournament for long. And
teams out there would give up
anything for 22 out of 23.
Lee Moffie broke off from the
line of his teammates. They had
been tortured far too long by then,
straddling the blue line at Joe
Louis Arena, watching as their
now-former conference rivals
accepted the Mason Cup.
Before the playoff trophy could
disappear, bound for Toronto, the
Hockey Hall of Fame and poster-
ity with a quick detour in South
Bend along the way, Michigan
dipped into the tunnel.
But not before Moffie said
goodbye to the Wolverine faithful,
who hoped to see ateam that was
once 10-18 punch its ticket to the
NCAA Tournament. That would
signal that the group Berenson
repeatedly called "vulnerable,"
and once, a "train wreck" mid-
way through the season was now
magical.
Moffie skated a quick circle,
waving his stick to the Michigan
fans who remained in Joe Louis
Arena, while the rest of the team
quickly stepped off the ice.
All of their last-ditch efforts,

like goalie Steve Racine turning
on a dime on his way to the bench
and diving back toward the crease
to stop the empty-net goal that
sealed the Wolverines' fate, had
fallen short.
Moffie's goodbye as he stepped
off the ice for the last time in
maize and blue might as well have
been a white flag, but he didn't
do it until after the game. Most
everyone else, besides the players
and coaches, had waved one in
surrender months ago.
Everybody except for the peo-
ple in the locker room gave up on
this team.
Don't feel bad for them. Beren-
son said all year that this team
was going to earn its fate. If the
Wolverines didn't make the NCAA
Tournament, they'd have nobody
to blame but themselves.
But how can we blame them?
Because for the last month and
a half of this season, when Michi-
gan's unbeaten streak that ended
at nine games began, the Wolver-
ines had everybody believing they
were going to catch lightning in a
bottle. Even Jeff Jackson.
It was just a little too late.

Dream run ends inches short of title

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Editor
DETROIT - When the Michigan
hockey team squared off against
NO. 9 Notre Dame in the CCHA
Championship on Sunday, 22 years
ofhistory were on the line.
The Wolverines would either
win and make a 23rd-consecutive
NCAA Tournament, or lose and go
home.
And the CCHA's final Champi-
onship game at Joe Louis Arena
didn't disappoint. It was either tied
or a one-goal game until the final
minute. But _
Michigan (11- MICHIGAN 1
15-3 CCHA, NOTRE DAME 3
18-18-3 over-
all) couldn't overcome the Fight-
ing Irish's constant pressure and
its own inability to get shots on net,
falling 3-1. For the first time since
1990, the Wolverines will not be
playing in the NCAA Tournament.
The Wolverines started out
Sunday's game like it ended a day
earlier, when it bombarded No. 3
2C I The Streak, March 25, 2013

Miami (Ohio), 6-2, by dominating
the play and controlling the puck in
Notre Dame territory. But after the
first shift was over, the Wolverines
rarely controlled the puck again.
The Fighting Irish (17-8-3, 24-12-3)
used a strong forecheck to keep the
play deep in Michigan's zone, and
dominated the first period with 18
shots compared to the Wolverines'
6 - a trend that would plague them
all game.
Freshman goaltender Steve
Racine bailed out the Michigan
defensemen on more than one occa-
sion, and just when it seemed like
Notre Dame might finally get on
the board during a late power play,
the game decided to take a different
path.
The Wolverines got a steal at
their own blue line, going on a 3-on-
2 rush. After freshman defense-
man Jacob Trouba, senior forward
Kevin Lynch and sophomore for-
ward Derek DeBlois bounced the
puck around the crease, DeBlois
knocked it home. This was the sec-
ond-straight game that Michigan

opened up the game's scoring with
a short-handed goal.
Despite being outplayed and out-
hustled for almost the entirety of
the first 20 minutes, the Wolverines
managed to take a 1-0 lead into the
first intermission.
"We knew we could play better
than we played in the first and we
escaped the first period and we just
had to play better in the second,"
said Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"I thought penalties really kept us
on our heels in the second period,
but we were fine."
The momentum wasn't enough,
though. The combination of Notre
Dame's constant'offensive pressure
and Michigan's inability to stay out
of the penalty box - it spent six of
the period's 20 minutes in the box -
allowed the Fighting Irish to even
up the score at one on an Anders
Lee goal, who has had a lot of suc-
cess against the Wolverines this
year.
When Michigan was swept by
Notre Dame on Feb. 8 and 9, Lee fin-
ished the weekend with three goals

and two assists. And the trio of Jeff
Costello, Lee, and Bryan Rust have
been one of the most prolific lines in
the entire CCHA, finishing the sea-
son with a combined 98 points.
After two periods, the Fighting
Irish had tallied an impressive 28
shots, compared to Michigan's 10.
Notre Dame led the CCHA in scor-
ing with 3.21 goals per game this
season, and the constant peppering
of Racine showed why. The Fight-
ing Irish finished the game with 33
shots on net, which is the highest
total the Wolverines have given up
throughout their tournament run.
"They had a good cycle going
against us (on offense)," said senior
defenseman Lee Moffie. "They're
a physical team and they're a big
team, and they really pushed us in
our zone and that was the big issue.
We were having a hardtime d'ingup
on them and stopping their cycle."
But 21 seconds into the third
period, the Wolverines luck ran out.
Racine let a rebound get away from
him, and Notre Dame's T.J. Tynan
buried it, giving the Fighting Irish a

one-goal advantage.
Though Michigan picked up
the intensity following the Notre
Dame's go-ahead goal, the Wolver-
ines couldn't find that last-minute
tally. With 1:07 left, Racine was
headed towards the bench for a six-
on-five, and Notre Dame turned
a turnover at mid-ice into an easy
empty-net goal to secure the vic-
tory.
"I thought our team would
bounce back in the third and they
tried," Berenson said. "Goals were
precious tonight and you knew
there wouldn't be many of them,
and giving up that early (third-peri-
od) goal was a tough one and we just
couldn't get that back."
The NCAA Tournament Selec-
tion Show is Sunday night, and
though Michigan finished the sea-
son with an impressive nine-game
unbeaten streak, the loss' to Notre
Dame all but eliminated it from one
of the few at-large bids.
Now, on Sunday, the Wolverines
Cinderella run through an impres-
sive CCHA has ended.
