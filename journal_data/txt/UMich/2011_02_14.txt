Armstrong to file
civil lawsuit if
libelous comments
aren't withdrawn
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily Staff Reporter
A document filed Friday has
brought the ongoing legal bat-
tle between Michigan Student
Assembly President Chris Arm-
strong and Andrew Shirvell,
a former Michigan assistant
attorney general, one step closer
to becoming a civil lawsuit.
Deborah Gordon, Arm-
strong's attorney, filed paper-
work Friday with the Attorney
Grievance Commission of Mich-
igan in reply to a response filed.
by Shirvell's attorney Philip
Thomas last month. Thomas's
response regarded Gordon's
original request for an investi-
gation of Shirvell.
Gordon said in an interview
Saturday that she and Arm-
strong plan to file a civil lawsuit
against Shirvell if he doesn't
publicly retract libelous state-
ments he's made about Arm-
strong. These -statements were
made on Shirvell's blog Chris

Armstrong Watch - on which
Shirvell wrote Armstrong was
encouraging a "radical homo-
sexual agenda" as MSA presi-
dent - and on national media
outlets like CNN's Anderson
Cooper 360.
"He's clearly done this in all
of these ways, and he needsto be
disciplined," Gordon said.
Shirvell was fired from the
Attorney General's office in
November following a com-
plaint filed by Gordon. The com-
plaint was in response to a series
of verbal and written assaults
against Armstrong by Shirvell.
Former Michigan Attor-
ney General Mike Cox wrote
in a statement at the time that
Shirvell "was fired for conduct
unbecoming a state employee.'
T is conduct included updating
his blog about Armstrong while
Shirvell was supposed to be
working and not being truthful
during a disciplinary hearing.
The reply Gordon filed Fri-
day states that Shirvell stepped
"beyond the well-defined limits
to the items the First Amend-
ment protects" when he posted
a swastika over an image of
,,Armstrong's face and called him
"racist" and "sexually promis-
cuous," among other libelous

Egyptian
students celebrate
democracy on Diag
ByJOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily News Editor
The Diag was transformed
into Liberation Square on Fri-
day afternoon as members of
the University's Egyptian Stu-
dent Association celebrated the
overthrow of former Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.

About 20 students took to
the Diag to rejoice and share
their joy with others on campus.
Many passed out Snickers bars
and other chocolates to students
walking by. LSA junior Eman
Abdelhadi said it's traditional to
pass out sweets on happy occa-
sions.
"Egyptians - and Arabs in
general - have this tradition
where they pass out treats at
good occasions," Abdelhadi
said. "At weddings, religious
occasions, Eids, like the holi-
days. This is an Eid. This is a

holiday, for sure. And we're just
so pumped that it happened."
After 18 days of anti-govern-
ment protests that swept across
Egypt and captivated the world,
Mubarak resigned Friday and
headed to the Red Sea resort
town of Sharm el-Sheikh. The
Egyptian military, which is
now in charge, dissolved parlia-
ment yesterday and called for
democratic elections within six
months.
"The idea of a democracy in
the Middle East, the idea of the
Middle Eastern people actu-

ally writing their own destinies,
actually making change come
about through popular revolt is
amazing," Abdelhadi said as she
handed out candy to passersby
on the Diag. "Anyone who stud-
ies Middle Eastern history is
just boggled by this. No one saw
this coming."
On Jan. 28, about 80 mem-
bers ofthe University communi-
ty gathered on the Diag to show
their support for the protest-
ers in Egypt. Rackham student
Sameh Tawfick said he didn't

Money raised from
fraternity's annual
Rivalry Run
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
The physical stress of a
90-mile relay run paid off on
Friday when members of the
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity pre-

sented a check for more than
$40,000 to the University's
Comprehensive Cancer Center.
In November, 72 Pike broth-
ers teamed up with Ohio State
University's Pike chapter to par-
ticipate in the annual Rivalry
Run. The run began in Colum-
bus, Ohio - where this season's
game against Ohio State was
held - and ended in Ann Arbor
with the runners carrying the
game football the whole way.

Doreen McGuire, develop-
ment events coordinator at the
Cancer Center, praised Pike
for raising the large amount of
money. Though the center works
with other student groups,
McGuire said it rarely gets a
donation of this magnitude.
"This is one of the largest
gifts from a student group we've
ever had," McGuire said in an
interview after Pike presented

Bahrain security forces
on alert amid protest calls

*I

Shiite opposition
groups plan
anti-government
demonstration
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates
(AP) - Bahrain's security forces
set up checkpoints and clashed
with marchers in at least one
village yesterday as opposition
groups blanketed social media
sites with calls to stage the first
major anti-government protests
in the Gulf since the uprising in
Egypt.
The wide-ranging clampdown
appeared directed toward Bah-
rain's Shiite majority - which
had led the drive for today's ral-
lies - and reflected the increas-
ing worries of the Sunni rulers
who have already doled out cash
and promised greater media
reforms in an effort to quell the
protest fervor.
A prominent human rights
activist predicted "chaos and

bloodshed" if attempts are made
to crush the planned demonstra-
tions.
The tiny kingdom of Bahrain
is among the most politically vol-
atile in the Gulf and holds impor-
tant strategic value for the West
as the home to the U.S. Navy's
5th Fleet. Bahrain's Shiites -
accounting for nearly 70 percent
of the population - have long
complained of systematic dis-
crimination by the ruling Sunni
dynasty, whose crackdown on
dissent last year touched off riots
and clashes.
Shiite-led opposition groups
and others have joined calls for
the demonstrations on a sym-
bolic day - the anniversary of
Bahrain's 2002 constitution that
brought some pro-democracy
reforms such as an elected par-
liament.
In Karzakan, a Shiite village
in western Bahrain, riot police
clashed with a small group of
youths who staged a march fol-
lowing a wedding ceremony. An
Associated Press photographer

saw several people injured and
others gasping from tear gas.
Security forces set up check-
points around the Shiite vil-
lages and throughout the capital
Manama to monitor people's
movements. Units also patrolled
malls and other key spots in a
clear warning against holding
the rallies, which have been the
focus of social media appeals and
text messages for more than a
week.
One cartoon posted on a Bah-
raini blog showed three arms
holding aloft a mobile phone and
the symbols of Facebook and
Twitter.
Bahrain's leaders, meanwhile,
have stepped in with concessions
to try to defuse the protests.
Government media monitors
began talks Sunday with news-
paper publishers and others to
draft new rules to limit state con-
trols. The official Bahrain News
Agency, meanwhile, launched
a new multimedia service that
includes social media applica-
tions to seek more outreach.

A woman shouts slogans against Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi during a protest in Milan, Italy, yesterday.

Italian Premier Berlusconi

Women say leader's
alleged sexual acts
degrades females
ROME (AP) - More than
100,000 Italian women and their
supporters turned out across the
country to protest against Pre-
mier Silvio Berlusconi, saying his

dalliances with young women
humiliate the sex as a whole and
degrade female dignity.
Backers of the 74-year-old
Berlusconi, who is under inves-
tigation for allegedly paying for
sex with a 17-year-old girl, dis-
missed the protests as strictly
political.
The teenager, a Moroccan
night club dancer, has said Ber-

Prostitution isn't a crime in
Italy, but paying a minor for sex
is. Prosecutors are requesting to
put him quickly on trial in what
has been the most sensational
probe against Berlusconi in
over a decade of criminal cases
against him, mainly for dealings
in his billion-dollar empire of
TV, film, advertising and other
business interests.
The premier, who willingly
acknowledges his fondness
for pretty young women and
is being divorced by his wife
for his purported dalliances,
claims he is being victimized
by left-wing prosecutors who
want to topple him from power.
From the tiny island of La
Maddalena in Sardinia, to larg-
er cities like Naples, Venice and
even foreign venues like Paris,
where around 400 people
gathered outside Sacre Coeur
church to bang pots and pans,
women pressed for Berlusconi
to resign.

town where Berlusconi has
boasted about his reconstruc-
tion efforts after the 2009
quake damage, women com-

Obama to send 2012
budget to Congress

Budget includes
$1.1 trillion in
deficit reduction
WASHINGTON (AP) -
President Barack Obama will
send Congress today a $3 tril-
lion-plus budget for 2012 that
promises $1.1 trillion in deficit
reduction over the next decade
by freezing many domestic pro-
grams for five years, trimming
military spending and limiting
tax deductions for the wealthy.
Jacob Lew, the president's
budget director, said yester-
day that the new spending plan
for the 2012 would disprove
the notion that "we can do this
painlessly ... we are going to
make tough choices."
Republicans rejected that
appraisal, castigating Obama for
proposals that will boost spend-
ing in such areas as education,
public works and research, and
charging that Obama's cuts are
not deep enough.
They vowed to push ahead
with their own plans to trim
$61 billion in spending from the
seven months left in the current
budget year and then squeeze
Obama's 2012 budget plan for
billions of dollars in additional
savings in response to voters
alarmed at an unprecedented
flood of red ink.
"He's going to present a bud-

get tomorrow that will continue
to destroy jobs by spending too
much, borrowing too much and
taxingtoo much," House Speak-
er John Boehner said on NBC's
"Meet the Press." Boehner
released a statement from 150
economists calling on Obama to
take immediate action to reduce
government spending.
Lew, appearing on CNN's
"State of the Union," rejected
criticism that the $1.1 trillion
deficit-cutting goal fell far short
of the $4 trillion in deficit cuts
outlined by the president's
own deficit commission in a
plan unveiled last December.
That proposal would attack the
biggest causes of the deficits
- spending on the benefit pro-
grams Medicare, Medicaid and
Social Security - and defense
spending.
Obama's budget avoided the
painful choices put forward by
the commission on benefit pro-
grams. Lew said it would be a
mistake to say the report did
not have an impact on the presi-
dent's proposals.
He cited a proposal to pay
for keeping doctors' payments
under Medicare from being cut
sharply. Instead of borrowing
the money to prevent those cuts,
the administration was putting
forward $62 billion in savings
in other areas to prevent those
cuts over the next two years,
Lew said.

they rallied activists Saturday
during the party's convention in
Detroit.
The state party's longtime
chairman, Mark Brewer, was
re-elected to his post, but not
before some party activists made
their dissatisfaction clear. Some
blamed Brewer for failing to stop
the Republican takeover of Mich-
igan's top statewide offices, the
state House and the Michigan
Supreme. The GOP also picked
up two more congressional seats
last November.
Detroit television producer
and Democratic activist Ron
Scott said earlier this week
he'd run for the chairmanship,
but decided against paying the
$1,000 fee to be put on the bal-
lot. Still, chants of "Run, Ron,

run?" broke out after Brewer was
nominated for his ninth two-year
term.
Brewer acknowledged the
anger, saying he planned to make
changes.
"I have heard your concerns,
and we are going to change, I
am going to change, in order to
address them," he told the rough-
ly 1,500 people who attended the
convention at the-Cobo Center. "I
can't change the Michigan Dem-
ocratic party by myself. I need
your help."
Brewer, 55, from Clinton
Township, thanked those who
entrusted him with revitalizing
the party before the 2012 elec-
tion, when Michigan Sen. Debbie
Stabenow will be up for re-elec-
tion.
"Our comeback in 2012 starts
now," he said.
Stabenow said the election
will be a tough year but Demo-
crats won't "allow those who use
hate and fear to win."
"It doesn't work if only the
wealthy and well-connected
do well in America," the sena-
tor said. "I'm not giving up until
everyone who wants and needs a

job has one."
U.S. Rep. Dale Kildee told the
crowd that the huge tax cuts
being called for by congressio-
nal Republicans and tea party
activists amounted. to "political
immorality," noting they'll slash
Head Start and programs for the
poor.
The congressman from Flint
said the "political Neanderthals"
needed to be sent "back to their
caves."
Stabenow's counterpart, U.S.
Sen. Carl Levin, listed a litany
of what he said were Democrat-
ic successes over the past two
years, including passing health
care legislation and helping save
the American auto industry.
United Auto Workers Presi-
dent Bob King said Republicans
want to undermine unions' right
to collect dues from all members
and wipe out prevailing wage
laws. In order to win next year,
"we have to demonstrate to the
voters again that the party of the
middle class...is the Democratic
Party," King said. "The Repub-
licans are trying to give more to
the wealthy and take away from
the working'people."

S-marter standards
Michigan needs to raise "cut-scores" for tests
n recent years, standardized test scores for students in Michi-
gan - including scores on the Michigan Educational Assessment
Program and Michigan Merit Exam - have fallen. Last Tuesday,
the state's Board of Education approved a proposal to raise the per-
centage of questions students must answer correctly in order to pass
these exams. Increasing the amount of points required to pass will
encourage schools to make sure they are educating their students to
the highest standards. Elevating proficiency standards will better
prepare Michigan students for success, and the board should contin-
ue to improve the state's education system.

America's man in Cairo

According to a Feb. 9 Freep.com article,
raising the "cut scores" will better prepare
students for their future. The cut scores are
the lowest scores a student can get to dem-
onstrate basic knowledge in a given subject.
A 24/7 Wall St. article reported that the cut
scores are lagging in most states - especially
Michigan - where eighth graders have scored
significantly lower on reading and math por-
tions of the tests in recent years.
The plan to raise cut scores is an impor-
tant decision that recognizes the changes that
need to be made in Michigan public schools.
The current standards aren't doing enough to
ensure that educators are adequately prepar-
ing students for their futures. The proposal
reaffirms Michigan's commitment to educat-
ing its students to the highest standards and
helping them to compete nationally and inter-
nationally.
one of the biggest concerns with Michi-
gan's current testing system isthe gap between
scores on state tests and scores on national
tests. Accordingto Amber Arellano, the execu-
tive director of the Midwest office of the Edu-
cation Trust, while 84 percent of Michigan
fourthgraders are passing state reading exams,
only 30 percent are meeting standards on the
National Assessment of Educational Prog-
ress, a federal exam. The disparity between

these two exams is drastic. If Michigan wants
its students to succeed, legislators must stop
sugarcoating the academic rigor required for
students to achieve proficiency.
By raising the cut scores on standardized
exams, the Board of Education can give stu-
dents, parents and educators the opportunity
to see where students actually place on the pro-
ficiency scale and what areas need improve-
ment. While opponents of this plan argue
that significant drops in students' test scores
may worry parents, it's important that scores
actually reflect students' knowledge. Without
recognizing the flaws in the state's education
system, Michigan students may never be ade-
quately prepared for higher education in com-
parisonto national standards. Students need to
be challenged to succeed, and this plan - likely
to be implemented in the 2011-2012 school year
- gives Michigan schools the opportunity to
properly test students.
Michigan should move forward with this
plan and continue its commitment to students.
and education. Without high testing stan-
dards, studentswill not be prepared for higher
education, and they will not achieve greater
professional success. If educators want to stop
the cycle and keep Michigan "smart," the
state should continue to renovate the educa-
tion system.

n 1946, a junior U. S. State
Department diplomat named
George Kennan wrote a 5,500-
word essay about
the evolution
of communist
thought in Rus-
sia from the mid-
19th Century to
the (then) pres-
ent. The essay,
"The Sources
of Soviet Stra- NEILL
tegic Conduct," MOHAMMAD
was remarkable
for two reasons.
First, it was correct about almost all
aspects of Soviet politics, including
the often misunderstood connection
between the Soviet system and the
Tsarist feudalism it replaced. The
second was that after it was pub-
lished, a year later under a pseud-
onym in Foreign Affairs magazine, it
became the cornerstone of the next
60 years of American foreign policy.
Kennan's insight - that the Soviet
system was inherently unsustain-
able because it required leaders to
invent an endless series of threats in
order to justify a totalitarian police
state - was the basis of "contain-
ment," or the idea that the Western
powers should seal communism
behind its current borders and let
the march of time do the rest. In the
long term, this worked; the USSR
collapsed, and did so for largely the
set of reasons that Kennan had iden-
tified. Containment of communism,
however, required a separate and
darker "containment" of its own: the
elimination of any and all domestic
political oppositionwithin Amer-
ica's anti-communist allies. And
just like Soviet leadership had to
invent horror stories about capitalist
encirclement to legitimize their rule,
American clients invented similar
claims about the chaos and barba-
rism that would ensue if they were
ever forced from power.
Containment meant at best the

tolerance and at worst the outright
endorsement of some of the world's
worst crimes. America's man in
Santiago, Augusto Pinochet, "dis-
appeared" political dissidents by
packing them into cargo planes
and dumping them over the Pacific
Ocean. America's men in Johannes-
burg, the National Party, did their
best to suppress "instability" - bet-
ter-known as Nelson Mandela, who
was finally imprisoned at Robben
Island for 26 years thanks to a tip
passed along by the CIA - in their
own country. America's men (and
one woman) in Islamabad have
been a grim succession of military
juntas or kleptocrats, each increas-
ingly indistinguishable from the
last. The current president of Paki-
stan, Asif Ali Zardari, is so corrupt
that he's widely known as "Mr. Ten
Percent", referencing the kickbacks
he allegedly received. And when
he's out of the way, he'll do his best
to pass power to his son. Contain-
ment didn't just delay democrati-
zation in many parts of the world,
but actually encouraged monarchy
instead.
This brings us to Egypt. Con-
tainment - having contorted itself
to address transnational terrorism
rather than international commu-
nism - required that Obama, Sec-
retary of State Hillary Clinton and
every other American official in the
public eye, line up immediately in
support of our man in Cairo, Former
Egypt president Hosni Mubarak.
When that didn't work, the admin-
istration pivoted to the next best
option, Omar Suleiman. Suleiman,
74, was the head; of Egypt's spy
agency, and in that capacity he was
an important supporter of America's
"extraordinary rendition" program.
He has overseen countless tortures,
including that of an al-Qaeda opera-
tive who gave a false confession
about links between Saddam Hus-
sein and Osama bin Laden. As you
might expect of someone who has

been in government nearly as long as
Mubarak himself, Suleiman is uni-
versally reviled by the public he is
meant to lead.
But containment - particularly
in the Middle East - has never been
challengedbyagrass-roots, non-vio-
lent uprising of the sheer scale that
we've now seen in Egypt and Tuni-
sia. Spurred on by cheap technology,
which helped protesters not only
organize themselves but also to see
how their own story was being told
by international media, the writing
may be on the wall for the future of
containment.
Egypt exposes
uncertain future
of containment. 9
Repressive governments need
to be able to lie to their own people
about the wider world in order to
keep them pliant and cooperative. *
The democracies that work hand-in-
glove with such regimes need to be
able to believe their own lies about
the danger of seeing the world inany
other way. Neither of these are ten-
able when everyone with an Inter-
net connection can get an intimate,
unblinking picture of the revolu-
tion as it plays out: Organized, non-
violent, serious about democratic
change and unwilling to take no for
an answer.
Suleiman conceded on Friday
when he told Egyptians to turn off
their satellite televisions because
they were enemies of the state. Too
little, too late: Egyptians don't seem
to have any use for our new man in
Cairo. Neither should we.

Many people will spend today exchanging roses,
chocolates, Hallmark cards and their fair share of saliva,
as is tradition in our country. Others take a more apa-
thetic approach toward the holiday, while a small minor-
ity will wallow in heartbreak, consumed in a state of
proverbial obsolescence.
For the citizens of Ciudad Juarez and other cities in
Mexico that have been ravaged by drug-related violence,
this notion of heartbreak hits much closer to home.
According to Mexican officials, 34,612 people have died
in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe
Calderon declared a war against drug cartels in 2007.
And in 2010 alone, these killings reached their highest
level, with a total of 15,273 deaths. To put this in per-
spective, the Iraqi occupation caused 4,436 American
troop casualties since 2003.
The recent surge in violence has undoubtedly been a
byproduct of United States and Mexican drug laws, par-
ticularly the militaristic approach that has character-
ized enforcement of the latter. With drug prohibition, a
black market is created in which individuals are unable_
to settle conflicts through the legal system. Thus, drug
cartels resort to violence to settle disputes.
Mainstream news coverage and attention given to
this atrocity by our federal government has been negli-
gible. Between the two of them, President Barack Obama
and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) produced thousands of
sound bites during the heated 2008 presidential elec-
tion. Yet, they seldom mentioned the rampant violence
that has overtaken the U.S.-Mexico border, let alone
addressed the issue in detail. Rather than come to a stop,
the violence associated with the Mexican Drug War has

increased at an alarming rate.
Not only has the Mexican War on Drugs placed the
security of our southern neighbor in jeopardy, violence
associated with the illicit drug trade has spilled over
into the U.S., especially around border cities. ABC News
reported that Phoenix, Ariz. has become the new kid-
napping capital of the United States.
In response to the egregious absence of news cov-
erage by mainstream outlets regarding the increasing
violence that is consuming Mexico, a coalition of Uni-
versity student groups has convened to enhance aware-
ness about the atrocity taking place south of our border.
Students for Sensible Drug Policy, the University's
chapter of College Libertarians, Latin@ Social Work
Coalition, the University's chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Through Educa-
tion and Students Organizing for Labor & Economic
Equality have named Feb. 14 as a day of awareness
about the Mexican Drug War.
A daylong campaign will take place to reach out
to the campus community, including distribution of
informational flyers and an artistic exhibition of drug-
related violence. These efforts will culminate at 6 p.m.
at Rackham Amphitheatre, with three renowned speak-
ers providing their insight on the drug-related violence
in Mexico and offering solutions to this underreported
tragedy. This event is free, and the campus community
is encouraged to attend.
Emily Basham is the executive director of
Students for Sensible Drug Policy. Alex Biles is
the vice president of the College Libertarians.

play an incredibly important
role as economic leaders in our
community," Silverman said.
"(I) decided I could create more
positive change, I think, in the
private sector."
Silverman left Skype in Octo-
ber and is now the executive
in residence at the California-
based venture capital company
Greylock Partners. He stressed
the importance of goal setting
* and finding inspiration for aspir-
ing entrepreneurs.
"What great leaders do is they
inspire people around a common
vision," he said.
Silverman discussed his cre-
ative philosophy by describing
his experience developing Evite.
com - a website that offers
online event invitations and
other planning tools.
"I wanted to build a compa-
ny for a product that was truly
useful," Silverman said. "It was
uniquely enabled by the Inter-
net. I wanted it to be viral ... and
I wanted it to be fun."
Silverman said though it may

that Gordon asked the State Bar
of Michigan to take away or sus-
pend Shirvell's law license.
"He's still refusing to take
responsibility for anything,"
Gordon said. "Chris and I
believe he's hiding behind the
First Amendment."
In her written reply to the
Attorney Grievance Com-
mission, Gordon wrote that
Thomas's response doesn't help
Shirvell's case because lawyers
are held to higher standards
beyond the First Amendment,
Gordon said.,
Thomas's response hasn't
been made public at the request
of the Attorney Grievance Com-
mission.

When contacted by the Daily
on Saturday, Thomas said he and
Shirvell hadn't received Gor-
don's reply and could therefore
not comment on its contents.
"I'm not in a position to
respond," Thomas said.
Gordon said the commission
is supposed to serve Thomas the
document soon. In addition, the
commission is still considering
the complaint filed by Gordon
last fall. Gordon said she expects
the commission's decision on
how to proceed with Shirvell by
June.
Gordon and Armstrong ulti-
mately want Shirvell to publicly
retract his statements about
Armstrong.

MUBARAK

think he'd be back on the Diag
celebrating so soon after protest-
ing against Mubarak.
"Even when we were here on
the Diag on the first day of the
protests, I wasn't expecting that
(Mubarak) would resign or step
down," Tawfick said as he waved
a small red, white and black
Egyptian flag. "I was protesting,
and I was thinking we just want
the whole world to know what
is going on in Egypt and that the
people are against the govern-
ment. We weren't expecting this
to actually happen with peaceful
protests."
LSA sophomore Sarah Awad-
Farid said she was watching Al-
Jazeera's online stream at her
job at the Institute for Social
Research Friday afternoon when

she found out Mubarak resigned.
"I went to my boss and said,
'Listen, I got to go. I have to go
make phone calls to my family. I
have to celebrate,"' Awad-Farid
said. "So I left, but they were'very
nice about it."
Awad-Farid said she spoke to
her family in Egypt on the phone
Friday, and they were ecstatic.
"Because they live in Cairo
near downtown, you can actu-
ally hear the beeping of the car
horns, the celebrations and the
music in the background," Awad-
Farid said. "They've honestly
been waiting for this for so long,
and they did it in such a dignified
way that, if anything, they have a
right to celebrate. They're so joy-
ous, and I'm so proud of them."
Abdelhadi, who was also
working at the ISR at the time,
said she became incredibly emo-
tional when she first heard the
news.

"I was at work and I started
crying," she said. "I called my
mother - she was weeping,"
Abdelhadi, who was born in
Egypt, said. "We grew up with
this super suppressive govern-
ment, and you always feel the
weight of it anywhere you go in
Egypt and now it's gone."
Abdelhadi said her whole
family took part in the celebra-
tions.
"They're euphoric; they're all
out celebrating," she said. "My
grandfather is 82 years old. I'm
so glad he made it for this.
Abdelhadi added,"People have
this new found sense of owner-
ship and inspiration and dignity,
and I feel like this is my coun-
try, and I want to be a part of it
again."

be difficult to initially figure out
what aspiring entrepreneurs
want to do, he said having large
ideas and following through
with them will be much more
rewarding than settling for
smaller ventures.
"When you try to do some-
thing big, great people want to
join you," he said. "When you're
doing something really mean-
ingful, the world conspires to
help."
But being an entrepreneur is
filled with both successes and
setbacks, Silverman said.
"If you're going to do an
entrepreneurial venture, you're
going to face some pretty hard,
pretty scary days," he said.
He explained this was the
case when Silverman initially
came to Skype in 2008.
"It was in the midst of an
industry that was in some tur-
moil," he said. "Most of my
friends told me that I would be
crazy."
Silverman told audience mem-
bers that in thinking about their
entrepreneurial pursuits, they
should consider how products
can benefit people worldwide.
"When I really thought about

it, Skype does something great,
it does something meaning-
ful," he said. "As you're think-
ing about your entrepreneurial
ventures, I'd encourage you (to)
think about things that really
are bold and audacious."
Silverman also stressed the
importance of pushing the sta-
tus quo to make a difference.
"Times change, capabilities
change, people's expectations
change - sometimes overnight,"
Silverman said. "We need to be
willing to constantly challenge
these conventional wisdoms
when you really want to unlock
greatness."
In an interview after Silver-
man's speech, LSA freshman
Nancy Xiao said she enjoyed the
lecture and is impressed with
Silverman's life experience. She
added that the eclectic nature of
the audience - which included
Business School and College of
Engineering students, among
others - indicated the broad
appeal of Silverman's presenta-
tion.
"I don't think it's business,
I think it's energy," Xiao said.
"And I think it's the enthusiasm
to make something happen."

field of research.
Flannagan said the University
has a long history of participa-
tion in projects involving crash
data analysis.
"We are world leaders in
transportation data analysis,"
Flannagan said.
The UMTRI has worked with
numerous automotive com-
panies in the past, including
General Motors Company, Toy-
ota and Ford Motor Company
as well as the National High-
way and Transportation Safety
Administration.
The University's research

with Audi is primarily vehicle-
based rather than evaluating
places or intersections where
accidents happen frequently.
Flannagan's team is looking at
crash records to determine the
most likely scenarios that cause
accidents. These documents
include police report crash
records, a national crash record
database and a database specifi-
cally for crash investigators.
Flannagan said she plans to
give Audi a list of five to 10 sce-
narios that commonly lead to
crashes. Rear-end collisions and
a driver's failure to judge gaps
between vehicles are among the
most common, she said.
Because of accelerated popu-
lation growth in cities, Audi
expects everyday commuter
challenges to increase according
to a Jan. 18 press release from
the Audi of America News Chan-
nel. In order to prepare for the

future, Audi started the three-
year project with the University.
The press release states that
once the crash analyses for
accident scenarios are evalu-
ated, Audi will be able to figure
out specific causes of accidents,
which will play a part in the
company's technological devel-
opments.
"Our plan is to integrate the
best technologies from the best
partners available and adapt
these for the automotive world,"
Rupert Stadler, head of Audi AG,
wrote in the pressrelease.
Flannagan expressed her
excitement about the Univer-
sity's involvement in the project
and said she is curious as to what
will come of it.
"Our involvement is just a
small part in what is an incred-
ibly ambitious and exciting
project they're trying to put
together," she said.

the check at the Cancer Center.
Karen Hammelef, director of
1 the Cancer Center's patient and
family support services, said
the $41,640 donation will be
split among the patient and fam-
ily sectors, with money going
to support counseling, mental
health services and chemother-
apy education.
LSA sophomore Joey Ives,
a member of Pike, said after
the presentation that meet-
ing the Cancer Center doctors
and learning how the frater-
nity's donation would be used
affirmed the importance of the
Rivalry Run.

"Today really brought life to,
the work we're doing,"'Ives said.
LSA sophomore Gene Taras, a
Pike brother and co-director of
the run, said the center's affili-
ation with the University made
the donation more personal for
him.
"It means a lot more know-
ing it goes to specific people at
the University where we study,"
Taras said.
Pike members usually partner
with the University's chapter of
the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
(Fiji) for the run, but since Fiji
participated in a different fund-
raiser this year, Pike decided to
team up with OSU's Pike chapter
for the run.
To raise money for the Cancer
Center, Pike got local sponsors

and garnered donations from
fraternity members' friends and
family.
Business junior Mike Adel-
man, a Pike member and co-
director of the run, wrote in an
e-mail interview that fundrais-
ing was more difficult this year
because Pike didn't have anoth-
er fraternity on campus to rely
on.
"We had to work much hard-
er (because) we were doing it
alone," Adelman wrote.
Hammelef said she was
impressed by Pike's ability to
raise more than $40,000 by
itself.
"What's impressive is that
they did all this on their own
with totally word-of-mouth
marketing," she said.

and Paw Paw rivers last fall as

whether bighead or silver carp

e Conservancy collected bodily wastes. Scientists with

Notre Dame and the conservancy
developed methods of using so-
called environmental DNA to look
for Asian carp in waterways link-
ing the Great Lakes and Missis-
sippi River basins near Chicago.
The carp escaped into the
Mississippi from Southern fish
farms and sewage lagoons in
the early 1970s and have been
migrating northward. They
have infested parts of the Mis-
sissippi and connected riv-
ers, out-competing other fish
for plankton. Scientists say if
they reach the Great Lakes, the
carp - which can reach 4 feet
in length and weigh up to 100

pounds - could disrupt the food
chain and threaten the $7 billion
fishing industry.
Michigan, Minnesota, Wis-
consin, Ohio and Pennsylvania
are pursuing a federal lawsuit
seeking to sever the man-made
connection between the lakes
and the Mississippi.
An electric barrier on the Chi-
cago Sanitary and Ship Canal is
designed to block fish migration.
But researchers have reported
Asian carp DNA in numerous
spots above the barrier, although
just one actual fish has been
found.
The team is trying to deter-

mine whether the carp have
reached the Great Lakes, which
are so big it would be hard to find
the invaders until they are well
established, said Chris Jerde, a
Notre Dame biologist and the
project manager.
That's why scientists have
been focusing on rivers where
the carp might go to spawn.
More than 20 rivers connected to
the lakes appear to offer suitable
carp habitat.
"You could potentially have
fish out there (in the lakes) and
never see them until they get to
these tributaries," Jerde said.
From Sept. 15 to Oct. 5, the

Notre Dame gnd Nature Con-
servancy team gathered 74
water samples from the Galien
River and 122 samples from the
St. Joseph and Paw Paw rivers,
which are connected. All were
negative, Jerde said.
Still to be processed are about
150 samples from the Maumee
River in Ohio, which flows into
Lake Erie, and the Milwaukee
and Menominee rivers in Wis-
consin.
The group plans to check
other rivers this year, includ-
ing the Grand, Pere Marquette,
Raisin, Belle and Black rivers in
Michigan, Jerde said.

TV/NEW MEDIA COLUMN
bOutsourced'
brings it home,

FILM REVIEW
Sandier can't stay w ith it
'Just Go With It' is another immature romp
through the old familiar Sandler-lot
By Ben Verdi I Daily Arts Writer

'Q utsourced" is one of
my favorite shows
on television. Yes,
that "Outsourced," the NBC
sitcom about the call center in
India that
caused all
the hooplah
about por-
trayingwild-
Â£ ly offensive
stereotypes,
appearing
on the A.V.
Club's "worst KAVI
new series SHEKHAR
of 2010" PANDEY
list. And
since I knew
you were wondering, yes, I am
indeed an Indian-American.
But before I begin my defense,
a bit of personal background
is necessary. I grew up in the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan,
a place with more bears than
brown people. Though my fam-
ily was part of our town's small,
tight-knit Indian community
(which existed solely because of
* the local university), my class-
mates and closest friends were
overwhelmingly not Indian.
Still, throughout my child-
hood, my parents made sure to
emphasize Indian culture, so I
grew up worshipping Bollywood
9 stars Shah Rukh Khan and Juhi
Chawala, learning Hindi and
practicing Hindu traditions
just like any kid from my native
region. But, as a kid, my strong
Indian identity was only part of
my private life - publicly, I bur-
rowed my Indianness due to a
fear a of ridicule by my friends,
who I thought wouldn't under-
stand myenjoyment of movies
with people gyrating their hips
to songs in a foreign language
(among other cultural chasms).-
I justdidn't want my frieni
to think that I was different
and weird - I would get embar-
rassed if my parents spoke Hindi
in front of them, but the minute
they left I would crank up the
"Dil Se" soundtrack on the ste-
reo and pull out my "Chacha
Chaudhary" comic books. These
dueling identities continued
throughout middle and high
school, slowly merging during
my senior year as I became more
confident in my brownness.
Then, freshman year of col-
lege, God said, "Let there be
'Slumdog Millionaire"' and
suddenly Indian culture became
universally cool. I eagerly
jumped on this new status quo,
watching movies like "Dostana"
with my American friends, feed-
ing them homemade Indian food
and teaching them assorted
words in Hindi. But it still didn't
feel complete - my culture
seemed more like an accessory.
People still couldn't comprehend
the aspects of Indian culture
that defined my personality.
That's when "Outsourced"
came into the picture. I'll be the
first to admit that I thought the
showwas goingto be a disaster.
The promos, which featured
jokes about a guy named "Man-
meet" ("Man Meat," LOL) and a
rotund Indian man awkwardly
singing along to the Pussycat
Dolls, made the show seem like a
step backward.
The pilot came along, and as
I feared, it was deplorable - the
jokes were as stupid as the pro-

mos forewarned, the characters
unlikable. I was ready to write
off the show permanently if
it hadn't been for a handful of
stylistic choices that I never
thought I'd see on primetime
American television - in partic-
ular, the use of the enthralling
title song from "Omkara," my

favorite Bollywood movie of all
time, throughout the episode.
I decided to watch the show
again the next week and noticed
a marked improvement, espe-
cially in the subtleties of the
interactions between Americans
and Indians. A sequence that
really hit home for me - and I'm
sure many other Indian-Amer-
icans - involved the character
Madhuri requesting her Ameri-
can boss, Todd, to pronounce
her name correctly. He repeat-
edly mispronounces it, and real-
izing the futility of the exercise,
Madhuri exasperatedly accepts
the wrong pronunciation.
The memories came rushing
back: all the first days of school,
when my new teachers would
read off the roll call and I would
cringe with anticipation of how
badlythey would butcher my
name. "KAY-vai?" they would
call out. "Actually it's pro-
nounced Kuh-vee," I'd respond.
"KAY-vee?" "Kuh-vee." "KAH-
vee?" "Yes, that's right."
The nostalgia of hearing Bol-
lywood songs from my child-
hood, combined with my ability
to strongly empathize with situ-
ations made me quickly warm to
"Outsourced." But my reverence
of the show didn't begin until
I saw the third episode, which
featured Todd and the object of
his affections, Asha, engage in
a discussion about their views
on relationships in Indian and
American culture. As Asha
explained the merits of arranged
marriage to Todd, I sat there in
amazement - arranged mar-
riage is such a significant part
of Indian culture that I haven't
been able to begin to explain to
my American friends through-
out my life, and here was this
NBC show doing the job for m,
It's pronounced
'Kuh-vee,' not
'Slumdog.'
Since then, "Outsourced"
has gone on to nail the aspects
of Indian culture I could only
dream of relating to my friends,
including the nuances that one
rarely sees in typical Western
depictions of India. Take paan
for instance, an Indian tobacco-
filled leaf sold on street corners
that many men - including my
dad - are hooked on. Watching
Gupta's addiction to the product
evoked my childhood joys of
squeezing onto a moped with
my dad, mom and sister as we
embarked on quests to buy paan
from street vendors in India.
And now, because of "Out-
sourced," I can talk to my house-
mates aboutpaan and they'll
know exactly what it is.
For me, and maybe for other
Indian-Americans, watching
"Outsourced" is anunbeliev-
ably cathartic experience. All
the aspects of my culture that I
publicly hid for so many years
surfaced as a sitcom for all of
America to watch. And hopefully,
the next Indian-American kid
growing up in the Upper Pen-
insula will never be afraid to be
expressive of his Indian identity.
It'll never be the wittiest

sitcom, and I doubt it will ever
win any Emmys. But whether it
lasts just one season or 10, I will
never forget what "Outsourced"
has done for me.

"Just Go With It" almost
feels like an experiment. It's as
if star Adam Sandler ("Grown
Ups") and
his favor-
ite direc-
tor Dennis Just Go With It
Dugan
("Grown At Quality16
Ups") wrote and Rave
out the
beginning Columbia
and end-
ing of a movie, and then flew to
Hawaii to begin filming without
any particular plan for what was
going in the middle.
"How about Jennifer Anis-
ton?" Dugan probably asked
Sandler.
"Yep, add her in there some-
where," Sandler would have
indifferently replied.
"Consider it done! Who else
would you like to hook up with
in this movie?"
"The new blonde one ... the
one with Andy Roddick... "
"Oh yeah," would muse Dugan
and actor Nick Swardson ("Bed-
time Stories"), big-screen new-
comer Brooklyn Decker's name
escaping them both.
"Eh, it doesn't matter. She's
hot!" they'd all conclude, moving
on directly to how they'd all split

the movie's box-office earnings.
It's these spur-of-the-moment
conversations and decisions
that made Sandler's early mov-
ies like "Happy Gilmore," "Billy
Madison," "Big Daddy" and
"The Waterboy" so spontaneous,
unpredictable and hilarious. But
because Sandler is relying on the
same formula for comedic alche-
my that he always has, his mov-
ies and their jokes have begun to
feel repetitiye and forced.
Some of the jokes in this movie
go on far too long, while others
are not developed enough. The
movie's farcical plot involves
Sandler, Aniston and Swardson
lying, as a group, to Sandler's
new girlfriend (played by Deck-
er) about Sandler and Aniston's
past together. The lie is that they
were once married and had kids
but have since gotten divorced,
which is why Sandler is now
conveniently available. The
truth is that he's never been in
a relationship with Aniston, but
wants to pretend he was married
at one time to gain some kind of
sympathy from Decker to help
win her over.
This idea for a plot would
work if we paid ty-see Adam
Sandler's movies for their intri-
cately portrayed love-triangles.

"Thanks for being in my movie ... ladies."
And if it was at all difficult to
trick Brooklyn Decker.
Farces are funny, people pre-
tending to be different people
are funny and Adam Sandler
is funny. But "Just Go With It"
feels like passing a cinematic
kidney stone. Two hours of pain
with only a few brief moments of
rest and possible laughter is not
enough to calla movie funny. It's
almost hard to call it a movie at
all. It feels like watching the first
performance of an improv com-
edy group whose members have
never met before.
There is no chemistry, there is
no plan and the funniest points
in the movie are funny because
they have the least to do with
the story itself. Aniston was

simply next on Sandler's hookup
bucket-list, and he figured he'd
add Brooklyn Decker in because
... well, have you seen what she
looks like? Swardson is funny,
but he seems to be Sandler's new
favorite muse simply because of
how irrelevant Rob Schneider
has become.
Meanwhile, Sandler grows
older and more predictable with
each half-baked movie he puts
his name on. It's sad to watch
a legend keep playing past his
prime, but that's exactly what
Sandler is doing. He's like the
aging Don Corleone in"The
Godfather." His name, and the
greatness he's already achieved,
seem to be the only powerful
things he has left.

ture, making them all nearly
indistinguishable from each
other and tedious to watch. But
from its very first scene, "The
Chicago Code" makes sure audi-
ences know its not going to be
just another "crime of the week"
snooze-a-palooza.
The opening voiceover, deliv-
ered by newly appointed police
superintendent Teresa Colvin
(Jennifer Beals, "The L Word"),
explicitly indicates that the
show will be a continuous nar-
rative, a saga following Colvin's
crusade to take down the noto-
rious corruption of Chicago's
political system (land of Rod
Blagojevich and Richard Daley)
- namely, the rotten Alderman
Ronin Gibbons (Delroy Lindo,
"Kidnapped").
It's a bold beginning for what

promises to be a bold series (at
least by network standards).
And, despite the problems of
its pilot, "The Chicago Code"
- brainchild of Shawn Ryan -
has laid the groundwork, with
its engaging storyline, to poten-
tially fill the great-police-drama
void left since Ryan's first cre-
ation, FX's "The Shield," ended
in 2008.
But right now, "The Chicago
Code" still feels like the non-
fat, decaf, no-whip version of
"The Shield." Ryan's previous
program featured a squad of
extremely crooked police offi-
cers, but the crooked in "Code"
are the politicians and wealthy
businessmen - because corrupt
cops would be too risqu, right?
"The Shield" was also famous
for its use of handheld cameras,
especially during frantic foot
chases through the backyards of
Los Angeles ghettos. The pilot
of "Code" involves an identical
chase scenario, though it only
shoots with a handheld for a
brief snippet before realizing it's
not cool enough to wear those
pants and switching back to a
plain old Steadicam.
Where "Code" particu-
larly pales in comparison to
its predecessor is in the char-

"The Illusionist" is one of those
time-capsule films, with a style so
quaint and unassuming it seems
transplanted
in whole from
another era.
And it may The IliusioniSt
have arrived
at the wrong At the State
time for audi- Sony Pictures Classics
ences to prop-
erly enjoy it
- or at least American audiences,
for whom. any discussion of the
film needs to be prefaced with,
"Yes, it's a movie about a magi-
cian, but it's not the one starring
Edward Norton."
But the magic (for lack of a bet-
ter word) of this new "Illusionist"
- nominated for a Best Animated
Feature Oscar - is worth any
confusion it may cause. Which
is good, because its background
is about to get a lot more confus-
ing. Ready? It's based on a semi-
autobiographical script written
in 1956 by legendary French film-
maker Jaques Tati ("Playtime"),
now deceased - which would
certainly help explain the "from
another time period" thing. And
it was adapted into animation
by director Sylvain Chomet,
best known for "The Triplets
of Belleville," who modeled the
title character's demeanor and
appearance after Tati himself, or
more accurately after the version
of himself he often played in his
films (a bumbling, Chaplinesque
figure named Mr. Hulot).
It would certainly seem at first
glance like the decades of discon-
nect between script and screen

would prevent "The Illusion-
ist" from escaping its trappings
as a great mind's afterthought,
a past-its-expiration piece of
film-buff fluff. Many elements
of Tati's original vision were
altered in the finished prod-
uct, including the fundamen-
tal medium through which the
story is told. But the film some-
how transcends its curio status,
quite magnificently. Think of its
long road to production as the
extravagant setup to a really
great trick, the kind that makes
an audience cheer while asking,
"How did they do that?"
Turns out that Tati and Chom-
et were naturally made for each
other. Both share a penchant for
elegant, complex scene construc-
tion and surrealist slapstick. Both
view dialogue as an intrusion
on a film's aesthetic appeal. And
both use their films to satirize
the chaos of the modern world.
To this mix, Chomet adds one
element essential for viewers: He
gets us to care about the plights of
certifiably bizarre characters.
This is why we root for the
film's aging magician Tatischeff
as he bumbles through increas-
ingly smaller venues, performing
the same old parlor tricks and
carefully rolling up his same old
poster so he can take it to the next
gig. It's why we root for Alice,
a young maid who's astounded
by his talents and follows him
to Edinburgh, where she keeps,
insisting he buy her expensive
gifts (thinking he makes them
magically appear, when in fact
he blows through his paltry sav-
ings to please her). And it's why
we root for a background motley
crew of yesterday's entertain-

ers, including a down-on-his-
luck ventriloquist and a suicidal
clown.
Everyone here is dealing
in some way or another with
encroaching loneliness, the sense
that the world they once knew
has passed them by. Tatischeff
keeps indulging Alice's materi-
alistic urges because he desper-
ately needs someone around who
respects and admires him, no
matter what the cost. It's a sad
thought and a distinctly human
one - the idea that you'll wake up
one day with no one fulfilling that
need. Forget dying alone; living
alone is the hard part.
The magic
connoisseurs
who didn't get
into Hogwarts.
Chomet communicates this
longing with hilarious set pieces,
the best one involving a cigar-
chomping American and his
shiny car. Unsurprisingly for fans
of "Belleville," Chomet accom-
plishes some incredible things
with his animation, like sweeping
panoramas of the Scottish coun-
tryside. And he does it all while
still honoring Tati's legacy as an
old-world artist and performer,
giving him what his characters
can only dream about: one more
moment in the sun.
Yesterday's unrealized idea :
becomes " today's masterpiece.
What a trick.

Before facing Ohio State, Michi-
an coach Red Berenson pieced
ogether a line so potent it could've
arried the Wolverines to the
romised Land - last year's NCAA
inals.
But that was then, and this year
s a different story. When Beren-
son created a line combination of
eniors Carl Hagelin and Louie
aporusso and sophomore Chris
rown, he was doing it on a whim
nd out of dire necessity. Their 25
oals, entering the series, were less
han half of their production from
,ast season, and 13 of those tallies
came from Hagelin's stick alone.
I Once their blades hit the ice
r arly in the first period of Friday's
-2 victory over the Buckeyes, the
igh-octane line made Berenson
ook like a regular wizard. Capo-
usso netted the game-winning
oal on Friday, and Brown did the
onors in Saturday's 2-1 win. The
rio had seven points in the Wolver-
nes' series sweep of Ohio State at
Vost Ice Arena.
The three skaters, who had just
two points in the No. 13 Michigan

hockey teams three-game skid,
gave their coach exactly what he's
been asking for all year: his best
players finally were his best players.
The weekend belonged to
Brown, who caught fire to pace the
Wolverines (16-7-1-0 CCHA,19-9-4
overall) with two goals - the fifth
and sixth of his sophomore cam-
paign.
"It feels really good (to score
again), but I've got to give a lot of
credit to Louie and Carl," Brown
said. "I think we're just click-
ing right now. It's something that
(Berenson) was hoping for, and
I think we're doing above and
beyond what he wanted.
"Since we did juggle the lines
around, there was definitely a need
of more communication, so I think
that really helped."
Brown was on the prowl all
weekend, putting on a show that
coupled his scoring finesse with his
penchant for bashing and bruising.

that started last season in honor of

Three weeks ago, Michigan
was forced to kill 57 seconds
of a 5-on-3 in the final minutes
of the game to preserve their
one-goal lead over Alaska. The
Wolverines and the Nanooks
went back-and-forth all game,
until the penalty kill came to the
rescue in the waning minutes to
shut down Alaska and secure the
narrow victory.
The Michigan faithful were
as animated as they had been all .
season at Yost Ice Arena during
those 57 seconds - that is, until
Michigan's penalty kill gave the
6,900 in attendance an even big-
ger reason to be deafeningly loud
on Saturday against Ohio State.
With the No. 13 Michigan
hockey team leading 2-1, sopho-
more forward Chris Brown

picked up a five-minute major
penalty for checking from
behind and was ejected from the
game just two minutes into the
third period. Brown's penalty
came at a crucial time for the
Wolverines. It was both late in
the game and almost immediate-
ly after Michigan's power play
failed to get a shot off for the
opening 1:28 of the third period.
But the Michigan penalty kill
more than picked up the slack of
its woebegone power play this
weekend, killing all four Buckeye
attemps - and none more impor-
tant than killing off Brown's five
minute penalty.
"It's just great for our team to
win close games like this," senior
forward Carl Hagelin said. "It
always gives the team some
extra energy for next week, and
also confidence. That penalty
kill at the end, the five minute

major that Brownie got ... that we
killed that off was key."
The Wolverines didn't just kill
the major penalty on Saturday
- the stifled the Buckeye power
play during those five minutes.
Michigan didn't allow Ohio State
to geta single shot on net during
that kill.
But the Wolverines took three
shots of their own on Buckeye
netminder Cal Heeter.
Without one of its mos(physi
cal forwards on the ice in Brown,
Michigan continually found
ways to clear the puck out of its
own zone - something the Yost
crowd couldn't get enough of.
"It's unbelievable that they
could keep (Ohio State) out of
our end for five minutes," senior
netminder Shawn Hunwick said.

In late November, just five
games into the Michigan men's
basketball season, coach John
Beilein told his team that he knew
the Wolverines were a team he
could lose with, because he knew
they were going to get better. He
knew it was a team that would
learn from its losses.
Now, with five games remain-
ing in the regular season, and
after a disappointing January,
the Wolverines have shown their
improvement through the last two
and a half weeks, going 5-1 in con-
ference play.
But on Saturday, in Michigan's

73-69 win over Indiana, it really
looked like the Wolverines were
not only the team that Beilein
could lose with, but the team he
would lose with.
Ahead by as many as 22, the
Wolverines relinquished the
lead and allowed the Hoosiers to
mount a comeback to turn what
was a blowout into a nail biter.
Michigan showed its poise during
much of the game and came out
on fire in the second half, hitting
seven 3-pointers in the second
stanza.
But in the final five minutes of
the game, the Wolverines began
to falter. They failed to hit a field

assuming security was minimal).

EAST LANSING - The Mich-
igan women's basketball team
trailed by just 10 points at the
end of the first half, after a last-
second shot by Michigan State

height of
the shot clock and miraculously
fell back down through the net.
But that wasn't the last of the
bounces the Spartans would
receive.
Within the first three minutes
of the second half, the Spartans
quickly extended their lead to 17
points, en route to a 69-56 vic-
tory over Michigan. The Wolver-;
ines' poor offensive effort was the
main reason for Michigan's ninth
straight loss to the Spartans (10-2
Big Ten, 22-3 overall) on Sunday.
. "I just thought our offense was
awful," Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth said. "I thought our
defense did a decent job under
the circumstances, but (Michigan
State) hit shots."
Michigan's defense showed a
sign of resiliency against, argu-
ably, two of the best players in the
Big Ten - senior forward Kalisha
Keane and redshirt junior Lyken-
da Johnson. The Wolverines (7-5,
14-10) forced16 Spartan turnovers,
blocked four shots and nabbed six
steals in the game. Michigan also
held starting senior guard Cetera
Washington to zero points.
"Keane and Johnson are a
handful," Borseth said. "They are
bookends, they are just so strong.
Those are two kids that are going
to play in the WNBA and be very
good. We were really selling the
farmtotry andstopthose kids,but
there's a mismatch there."
But despite Michigan's aggres-
sive defensive effort, four Michi-
gan State starters were still able to
score in double-digits. According

Sophomore guard Jenny Ryan scored 11 p
to Borseth, the Wolverines just
couldn't contend with the strength
of the Spartans.
It was because of that strength
that Michigan couldn't get the
ball down low and into the lane.
The Wolverines - who only sunk
one shot inthe first five minutes of
regulation - scored just 16 points
in the paint and shot just 40.5 per-
cent from the field.
"(Michigan State) did a good
job playing defense," senior guard
Veronica Hicks said after the
game. "I figured it was goingto be
tough for me to get in around the
rim, that's something I liketo do. I
didn't get into the lane as much as
I wanted to and when I did there
were hands poking at me from
everywhere. They did a great job
closing the gaps and we need to
do a better job at maintaining my
dribble and keeping the ball closer
to our bodies."
Michigan shot 50 percent from
behind the 3-point arc, but that
alone was not enough to cut into
the massive Spartan lead. The
Wolverines average 22 3-point
attemptsper game this season, but
they shot just 16 long-range balls

oints in the loss to the Spartans.
against Michigan State.
Michigan mustered one offen-
sive run late in the second half that
brought it within eight points of
the Spartans. The Wolverines took
advantage of Johnson sitting the
bench because of foul trouble and
cut Michigan State's lead by nine
points. But then Johnson came
back onto the court, providing that
final spark the Spartans needed
to seal the win. Within her first,
two minutes of play upon return-
ing, Johnson scored four points,
grabbed two rebounds and dished
out an assist.
The Wolverines didn't recover
despite a well-spread offensive
effort that included 19 points from
the bench. The lack of scoring by
some of Michigan's key starters
had a toll on the team offensively.i
Junior center Carmen Reynolds
scored only one point on the night
and sophomore guard Rachel
Sheffer tallied just five of her own.
"It depends on the rhythm of
your offense," Sheffer said. "We
really didn't find any rhythm to
our offense all night. We went on a
few little runs, but we never really
got into thatrhythm."

But the defensive end was
another story. An ugly story.
Jordan allowed Holmes to
score everywhere, from the
low post to the high post, en
route to a game-high 29 points
on the night. And by the end of
the game, the coaches were left
scratching their heads. They'd
just witnessed the least satis-
fying 20-point victory of their
careers.
If Morgan couldn't stop
Rocko, how would he stop Ohio
j State's Jared Sullinger? What
about Illinois' Mike Tisdale?
And could he possibly manage
Minnesota's Trevor Mbakwe?
Alexander wasn't concerned,
though.
"I think there's always a hum-
bling experience that takes place
during the course of the season,
and Jordan was able to discover
his early against Concordia,".
Alexander said. "(Holmes) ran
a clinic, and as a result you can
imagine teammates after the
victory teased Jordan after the
fact. But Jordan has tremendous
pride, and he promised himself
that that would never happen
again. I dedicate Jordan's devel-
opment here in recent games to
the baptism of Rocko Holmes."
In retrospect, it wasn't par-
ticularly surprising that Holmes
did what he did. Jordan has since
learned that basketball, and post
play in particular, is a game of
geometry. And Holmes was sim-

OHIO STATE

introductions, and again after
his second-period goal. But it
rose once more when Brown
picked himself up off the ice
after taking an errant knee to the
thigh - still, he wasn't about to
be knocked out of the game or let
up on his physicality.
"You can't stop going full
speed," Brown said, explaining
the injury. "It's kind of like an
18-wheeler - you can't stop on a
dime."
Brown's last stand came two
minutes into the third period,
when he was sent to the dress-
ing room early after receiving
a five-minute major and game

misconduct for checking from
behind. Brown slammed his stick
on the end glass as he skated off,
but behind him the Texas flag
made it's final proud appearance
- the previously hapless Brown
was back in good graces with the
Michigan contingent.
"It's always nice to come home
to that (flag)," Brown said.
When Brown left the ice in
the third period, so did his big-
bodied, physical presence on the
wing of Michigan's power line.
But Berenson was pleased
with the physicality that his team
displayed against the Buckeyes
(9-13-2-2,14-15-2) on Saturday.
"I thought we played with a
little more gusto and a little more
oomph," Berenson said.
Before he was sent off, Brown

gave the Wolverines all the scor-
ing they'd need in the second
period. The goal was the epitome
of what Berenson was looking
for when he packaged the Texan,
Canadian and Swede on a line.
Hagelin picked up the puck
behind the net, circled around the
side boards and dishedbetween a
pair of defenders to Brown crash-
ing in toward the net.
Brown tipped the puck above
the shoulder of Buckeye goalten-
der Cal Heeter.
"Carl just waited, was really
patient with the puck, threw it at
the net and I kind of just chipped
it - took out my nine-iron and
just put it in there," Brown said.
Caporusso, who scored and
added an assist on Friday, said
shaking up the lines appeared to

"spark the chemistry" that some
players needed to find their scor-
ing touch in the weekend sweep.
"It's fun to be back with guys
who are more creative around the
net," Hagelin added. "We won
a lot of battles, second efforts,
and that's where we got all those
chances."
Berenson seems to have found
an offensive pairing that could
prove a scoringthreat for the long
haul.
And with just four games
remaining on the CCHA slate, it's
just in the nick of time.
"This is playoff hockey, really,"
Berenson said. "We're in kind
of a playoff mode, everything is
important ... this will hopefully
move our team in the right direc-
tion."

INDIANA
From Page 1B
sophomore guard Matt Vogrich
said. "Evan (Smotrycz) got in the
way of some passes. Tim (Hard-
away Jr.) had some steals. We just
stepped it up on defense."
Michigan made adjustments at
halftime because even though it
led the Hoosiers by eight points, it
could have led by a wider margin.
And so the Wolverines came out
firing in the second half.
Freshman Tim Hardaway Jr.
sank his first 3-point attempt in the
second half and finished the game
with 26 points. In fact, Michigan
gained a ton of momentum and
maintained a comfortable double-
digit lead after draining its first

four 3-pointers out of the locker
room.With about five minutes left
in the game, Indiana quietly went
on a 12-0 run to cut the lead from
22 points to 10 and then eventu-
ally found itself within two pos-
sessions of the. Wolverines after
Michigan had missed eight free
throws to close the game.
The crowd fell silent and Michi-
gan's bench looked frustrated. The
Hoosiers instituted a full-court
press for the last two minutes, and
it forced the Wolverines into two
turnovers and two timeouts.
"It's not like we were bad on the
inbound," Douglass said. "They
were doing a great job. Calling a
timeout isn't bad, it's better than
making a dumb pass and turning
the ball over. Butsometimes it was
hard to find the open man."

On top of the irritation that the
press was creating, Michigan was
fouled in the final minutes and
had difficulty finishing at the line.
In the closing minutes, four of the
Wolverines five starters accumu-
lated eight missed free throws -
Michigan went 19-for-37 from the
charity stripe on Saturday.
"You don't even really address
it," Michigan coach John Beilein
said of the poor free-throw shoot-
ing. "You don't make a big deal out
of it. I'll silently rep them more,
I'll silently do more things. But
we won't make a big deal out of
it because we've been very good
(at free-throw shooting) all year
long."
Indiana used a big 3-pointer
and its ability to penetrate the lane
to come within one possession of

the Wolverines with 28 seconds
remaining. But that's when sopho-
more guard Darius Morris - who
tallied 15 points - went to the line
and gave the Wolverines a two-
possession edge.
It's unusual that a made free
throw produces so much excite-
ment. But when Morris hit his
freebies to send Indiana back to
Bloomington, Crisler erupted.
"It was crazy, we've got such
good shooters," sophomore guard
Josh Bartelstein said. "It's one
of those things like how 3-point
shooting is contagious - free-
throw shooting is contagious too.
At the end of the game we couldn't
seem to buy any of them. But we'll
work on it. It's nothing we're too
worried about because we're a
good shooting team."

COMEBACK
From Page 1B
free throw, drawing groans from
Crisler Arena as the team stepped
to the charity stripe. It looked
like they would hand away a win
they'd worked for..
"Even coach (Beilein) says it all
the time, he's been coaching for
so long but you learn something
new every day, and we're learn-
ing something new every game,"
sophomore point guard Darius
Morris said after the win. "And
today we learned that we need
to close out games and pay atten-
tion to the little things like free
throws. Because that could cost
you down the road, next time we
might not be so lucky."
The point guard said his team's
mindset shifted from a team that
was playing to win in the first

part of the game to a squad that
was playing not to lose in the final
minutes.
While Indiana was making its
comeback, Michigan was slowing
down its offense and holding the
ball more, trying to burn time off
the clock. The Wolverines stopped
attacking the basket as much and
broke off from the aggressive
intensity that had allowed them
to post the lead in the first place.
"You see it all the time, teams
make runs at the end just because
they realize they have to play
more aggressive and they clear
their minds and they just play
ball," junior guard Stu Douglass
said. "And sometimes when you're
the team up 20, you kind of get a
little apprehensive and it takes
away from everything you were
doing the first 30 minutes of that
game and you're a whole different
team and that hurt us in the sec-

ond half." '
In their six-game losing skid
in January, the Wolverines were
often the team that was down 20
and making a run at the end.
But after a narrow loss to then-
No. 15 Minnesota on Jan. 22 -
and with Michigan fulfilling the
dismissive preseason prophesies
- the Wolverines have turned
things around and gone on a 5-1
run to put themselves back into
postseasontalk.
"We're on this good stretch,
but before this, we were used to
just clawing back," Douglass said.
"Coach (Beilein) talks about all
the time how you handle adver-
sity, but also, one of the bigthings
to a season is how you handle suc-
cess. And that's within a season,
but it's also within a game and so
we gotta get better at that."
A few of the recent Wolver-
ine wins have featured opposing

team comebacks that Michigan
has been able to fend off. Against
Northwestern, the Wolverines
relinquished a 15-point lead. And
in the close wins, like the victory
over Penn State and then-No. 25
Michigan State, the Wolverines
have been able to keep just enough
of a cushion to keep their opposi-
tion at bay.
Douglasssaidthe teamis learn-
ing from the wins and the losses,
and despite a victory over Indi-
ana, Michigan will have plenty to
look at as it heads into two tough
road games at Illinois and Iowa.
"(Beilein's) not worried that we
won't come back and be hungry,
he's not worried that we'll lose
that fire, he's not worried that we
won't want to get better," Doug-
lass said. "And every time we've
lost, we've improved here and
there, sometimes more than oth-
ers."
