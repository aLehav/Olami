More 
than 
150 
students, 

faculty 
and 
community 

members 
gathered 
Tuesday 

in Palmer Commons to hear 
five panelists address possible 
concerns regarding the future 
of environmental sustainability 
under President Donald J. Trump.

Panelists began by each giving 

a 
brief 
statement 
regarding 

the 
challenges 
environmental 

scientists and activists might 
anticipate 
under 
the 
new 

administration, 
including 

encouraging citizen education on 
issues related to natural sciences.

Trump has received criticism 

from 
environmental 
activists 

throughout his campaign because 
of his promotion of an increase 
in oil drilling and arguments that 
funding for the Environmental 
Protection Agency should be 
reduced or cut altogether.

However, 
Laura 
Rubin, 

executive director of the Huron 
River Watershed Council, argued 
that the idea of the president 
being 
the 
most 
productive 

section of government in regards 
to 
environmental 
care 
is 
a 

misconception. 
She 
explained 

the new administration in terms 
of the “sustainability spider web” 
analogy.

“You sort of have sustainability 

in the middle (of the spider web), 
and really when we understand 
that 
the 
role 
of 
the 
U.S. 

Central Student Government 

representatives Gaby Roth, an 
LSA junior, and Eli Schrayer, 
an 
LSA 
senior, 
introduced 

a resolution Tuesday night 
to 
fund 
monthly 
lunches 

promoting dialogue regarding 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
which was met with mixed 
reactions from the rest of the 
body.

“There were a lot of calls 

for us to take action and 
work together to address the 
issues that were brought up.” 
Roth said. “In trying to find 
something that we could really 
collaborate 
on 
we 
realized 

that until we actually stopped 
trying to correct each other’s 
narratives and just really try to 
work to understand each other 
… we need to acknowledge each 
other’s truths.”

Roth referred to Students 

Allied 
for 
Freedom 
and 

Equality’s resolution to divest 
its 
investments 
in 
several 

companies 
that 
allegedly 

commit human rights violations 
against 
Palestinians. 
The 

divestment 
appears 
in 
the 

body annually — this year, the 
resolution failed with 34-13.

LSA senior Devin Jones, one 

of the authors of the resolution, 
criticized the assembly after the 
resolution was rejected. 

“When you argue on the 

claim that we did not know what 
we were talking about, that you 

are somehow better than us … 
that is the epitome of privilege,” 
Jones said in November after it 
failed. “(I am) paying tuition, in 
which a portion of my tuition 
goes to companies that go to the 
oppression of my people … You 
have to live with this. You have 
to stare me in the the face.”

Roth appealed to the board 

for $200 to support the lunches, 
hoping to talk to a selected 
group of people who would 

fill out a questionnaire before 
the event. Roth and Schrayer 
stressed 
the 
importance 

of 
fostering 
meaningful 

interactions especially in light 
of the recent election.

This 
proposed 
resolution 

received mixed results, with 
some members pointing out 
it would be unethical if the 
lunches were being funded by 
CSG but weren’t open to all CSG 
members.

CSG President David Schafer, 

an LSA senior, believed CSG was 
not in the right place to address 
the situation, stating the body 
should not fund divisive issues 
of this nature.

“My suggestion would be to 

look through different avenues, 
such as Hillel, such as other 
organizations on campus who 
might be more invested in 
this,” Schafer said. “I would

“Hidden Figures” author discusses civil impact of true story to full Rackham Auditorium

Author Margot Lee Shetterly’s 

lecture focusing on her “Hidden 
Figures” 
book 
filled 
Rackham 

Auditorium and its overflow room. 
The event, which was sponsored 
by ¬¬the University of Michigan 

College of Engineering, highlighted 
the importance of Shetterly’s novel 
in social and political contexts.

“Hidden Figures” is the story 

of 
African-American 
female 

mathematicians at NASA in the 
years before and during the space 
race. The women, whose stories 
were covered up in history, helped 
put Apollo 11 on the moon through 

their work. The book was adapted 
to be a movie and has since been 
nominated for three Oscars.

Following an introduction by 

University President Mark Schlissel, 
Shetterly began by explaining the 
plot of the story, highlighting how 
the characters in the story pushed 
themselves to excel at school and 
were agents of much larger social 

change.

“Their next step was to convince 

their colleagues to look beyond, 
to look beyond their race, to look 
beyond their gender,” Shetterly 
said. “Their goal was, of course, 
not to stand out because of their 
differences, but fit in because of 
their talent.”

The recent renaming of the

System to Michigan Medicine, 
which took effect Jan. 9, is 
receiving criticism from nurses 
of the health center who believe 
the new title is exclusionary and 
unrepresentative of the hospital

“The University of Michigan

it 
more 
implied 

physician dominated practice.”

Business faculty member Ted 

London spoke about the need 
for private enterprise to develop 
solutions on a large scale to tackle 
global poverty on Tuesday at 
the Ross School of Business. The 
talk, which was sponsored by the 
Center for Positive Organizations, 
drew approximately 150 students, 
faculty and locals to the Business 
School Colloquium.

London 
is 
also 
the 
vice 

president of the Scaling Impact 
Initiative at the University of 
Michigan’s 
William 
Davidson 

Institute 
— 
an 
independent, 

nonprofit organization focused on 
providing private-sector solutions 
in emerging markets — and has 
worked on a variety of projects 
throughout the developing world.

Having dedicated his life to 

researching the pervasiveness of 
poverty throughout the planet and 

devising solutions for businesses to 
tackle these issues, London said he 
believes the world cannot simply 
donate its way out of poverty.

London believes that global 

poverty is the biggest problem 
facing the world. He illustrated this 
assertion by enlisting the global 
socioeconomic pyramid, a visual 
representation that divides the 
world’s wealth into three tiers: the 
“wealthy” at the top, the “emerging 
middle class” in the middle and 
the “base of the pyramid” at the 
bottom. Those at the base of the 
pyramid make less than $3,000 per 
year while the global “1 percent” 
are earners who make more than 
$380,000 per year.

“If we don’t solve the poverty 

problem, the inequity, honestly, 
this is going to be a very ugly 
world,” London said. “We cannot 
have billions of people on the 
outside looking in.”

London envisions a central role 

for private enterprise in developing 
products 
and 
businesses, 
but 

also believes it is important for 
businesses to develop solutions 
that can be crafted on a scale large 
enough to make a significant dent 
in eradicating global poverty.

“If you are thinking about 

billions of people, scale becomes so 
crucial,” London said. “I think we 
can solve vexing social problems, 
including impoverishment faced 
by the world’s poorest citizens, but 
we have to deliver results that are 
sustainable at scale.”

Business 
graduate 
student 

Anuj Narayanan said he believes 
London’s 
thoughts 
on 
how 

businesses can create value for the 
global poor imbued in him a sense 
of how a wide range of industry has 
the potential to help lift people out 
of poverty.

“Companies can create value for 

the bottom of the pyramid, and also 
for themselves,” Narayanan said. 
“If they can do that at scale, they 
can actually bring the majority 
of people in the bottom out of 
poverty.”

According 
to 
London, 

businesses and corporations 
that aim to tackle global 
poverty 
by 
developing 

solutions at the necessary scale 
must adhere to four principles: 
design for success, plan for 
scale, manage value creation 
and develop partnerships.

Yet, to London, Western 

companies and organizations 
aiming to develop solutions for 
poor populations in Africa and 
Asia must enlist locals to tap 
into their knowledge of local 
customs, politics and business.

Business graduate student 

Pranay 
Lagadapati, 
who 

is planning to work at an 
energy company in India 
after graduation this spring, 
said 
he 
believes 
Western 

organizations and companies 
too often fail to enlist locals 
in projects, but locals lack 
knowledge of how to develop 
businesses and products that 
could help alleviate poverty.

I HAVE BEEN GOING TO 
THE WRONG CLASS ALL 
SEMESTER

Cantina Taqueria + Bar, 

formerly known as BTB Cantina, 

is beginning the year with a brand 

new look. The nine-year-old bar, 

known for its late-night dancing and 

Mexican cuisine, revamped its taco 

menu and redesigned its interior 

space over Winter Break.

Adam Lowenstein and Justin 

Herrick, co-owners of Cantina and 

five other bars and restaurants, said 

the makeover came from a need 

to give the dancing space, bar and 

restaurant area each their own 

identity.

“We felt like we really needed a 

refresh,” Lowenstein said. “The idea 

was to basically separate BTB from 

Cantina.”

To accomplish this, they 

brought all the booths into one space 

and unified the paint color to make 

it look the same.

“Cantina has multiple 

identities,” Lowenstein said. “The 

whole problem that we have here 

is to try and really nail each one of 

those identities. It’s a bar at night 

and it’s a club; it has that whole 

South U kind of drinking aspect to 

it. But we have a restaurant too that 

operates through lunch and dinner. 

So we wanted to make it function 

— lunch, happy hour, dinner, late-

night — and really have a smooth 

transition throughout the day.”

Lowenstein said the biggest part 

of the menu changes was making 

seven different kinds of tacos. Over 

the summer, Cantina partnered 

with chef Magdiale Wolmark, a 

two-time James Beard nominee.

“We met up through some 

mutual friends,” Lowenstein said. 

“We decided to partner up on the 

menu. We needed to go above 

and beyond. Our whole idea was 

bringing in a chef and focusing on 

this menu to really nail these flavors 

and bring the quality of the food up, 

in order to create a destination.”

Their collaboration sought to 

shape Cantina’s new identity in 

focusing on a handcrafted taco 

menu with unique flavors and local 

sourcing. Herrick lauded Wolmark’s 

background in promoting and 

serving local food, and said they 

were able to work quickly.

“(Wolmark) brings the whole 

farm to table ethos to the menu,” 

Lowenstein said. “So our sourcing 

is local as much as it can be. Really 

where we put a lot of our time and 

energy was crafting this taco menu. 

At Cantina, we’re focusing on tacos, 

that’s our goal here. So we really 

fleshed out the taco menu.”

The drink menu now features 

craft and Mexican beers, as well as 

a margarita soda on tap. One feature 

the owners are won’t be changing, 

though, is the already successful 

Taco Tuesday.

“That’s one of our best days 

here,” Lowenstein said. “So we 

decided to really focus in on that 

success and really identify ourselves 

as an awesome taco joint.”

Lowenstein said students have 

reacted positively to the changes, 

especially the new flavors of tacos.

“We feel like it’s a comfortable 

space to hang out with a group,” 

Lowenstein said. “People don’t give 

students enough credit for their 

palette and their exposure to cool 

trends and cool foods that are out 

there. I think people have been 

really positive about the changes.”

Lowenstein said though 

Cantina is still a bar and a 

club, he hopes students will 

begin to recognize Cantina as a 

restaurant too.

“We have people who don’t 

even recognize Cantina as more 

than just a bar,” Lowenstein said. 

“So hopefully as people get to 

understand the breadth of what 

we do and try the food, things will 

begin to change.”

government and the president 
is one of those threads, and that 
there are so many other threads 
that hold that advancement on 
sustainability, that there are 
many parties that contribute 
to that,” Rubin said. “Many of 
them have been mentioned here, 
but especially the states, and 
a lot of our states have already 
been taking leadership on issues 
of climate, and energy, and 
transportation, 
wetlands 
and 

water.”

The panelists agreed, stating 

strong leadership from local and 
state levels will be crucial in the 
upcoming years. The University 
of 
Michigan 
has 
already 

begun making solid ground on 
these 
environmental 
issues, 

according to Rosina Bierbaum, 
professor of natural sciences 
and environmental policy, and 
in turn has helped contribute to 
overall goals on both state and 
national levels.

“I think we should be very 

proud of things that are taking 
place here at Michigan,” she 
said. “I’m very proud that 
sustainability is a big issue on 
this campus now, I’m very proud 
that President Schlissel has 
taken the national science and 
policy engagement committee’s 
report to identify ways that 
faculty can get more involved 
in government in Washington, 
and I’m very proud that the 
University of Michigan is part 
of the national data refuge 
project.”

After 
opening 
the 
floor 

to audience and moderator 

questions, 
the 
panelists 

discussed 
the 
issues 
some 

students looking to find careers 
in the environmental sciences 
might see in the coming years.

Dan Brown, interim dean of 

the School of Natural Resources 
and the Environment, asked 
about the recent announcement 
of the federal hiring freeze, and 
asked panelists to explain how 
students can respond to this 
possible shift in their career 
planning. The New York Times 
reported that the hiring freeze 
was announced on Monday. 
Trump signed an order calling 
for a halt on all public service 
jobs outside of those in national 
security, public safety and the 
military.

Molly Watters, a natural 

resources 
and 
environment 

graduate student, attended the 
panel with questions about a 
possible lack of opportunities 
after school.

“I think we’re all struggling 

to, you know, make sense of 
everything that’s going on,” she 
said. “I wanted to work for a 
federal land management agency 
after graduating and don’t know 
if that’s going to pan out … (I 
wanted) to hear what all of these 
smart academics have to say 
about it instead of whatever real 
or fake news I might find on my 
own.”

Erb Institute director Joe 

Arvai, 
professor 
of 
natural 

resources and environment and 
business, explained that, while 
federal government jobs may 
not be available, smaller, local 
positions could be beneficial.

“I think cities, states are going 

to be key, NGOs are going to be 
key, but also, throw business 

in the mix in a very diverse 
way, I don’t just mean the big 
multinationals, I mean any kind 
of business,” 

Arvai said. “If you go to the most 

unconventional places where you 
don’t think sustainability is at the 
cutting edge and try and make 
your impact there, everything 
you do will be huge.”

By the end of the discussion, 

panelists 
brought 
forth 

the 
importance 
of 
creating 

meaningful 
discussion 
about 

environmental 
concerns 
and 

having conversations with others 
to promote a more well-educated 
scope of activists.

Rackham 
student 
Leah 

Gerber agreed with the panelists 
providing information about the 
environment.

“At the end when they talked 

about engaging, he said, ‘engage, 
engage, engage,’ I think we really 
are going to have to change our 
daily lives,” she said. “You can’t 
just retreat you into your daily 
routine; we have to actively seek 
out and encourage each other to 
engage.”

Rackham student Alana Tucker 

said she believes environmental 
policies should not be a partisan 
issue.

“I think that communication 

of environmental sustainability 
and relaying that message as 
not a partisan issue is so, so 
critical coming from a very, 
very conservative state,” Tucker 
said. “I think just becoming 
more literate in learning how to 
communicate these topics is very 
important. … So not just thinking 
about engaging, but also thinking 
about who you’re engaging with 
is also really important.”

new combination of medical 
organizations and reflect a new 
purpose.

According to Runge, this 

new mission of the hospital 
emphasizes 
patient 
care, 

medical education and health 
care research.

“We remain committed to 

extraordinary 
patient 
care, 

world-class medical education, 
being an employer of choice for 
faculty and staff, and moving 
groundbreaking research from 
bench to bedside in order to 
save and improve lives,” Runge 
said in an article from Michigan 
Medicine.

For nurses, however, this 

new name change appears to be 

exclusionary and unsupportive 
of all the work that nurses and 
other hospital workers perform 
daily.

“The term ‘medicine’ is almost 

exclusively 
associated 
with 

physicians, yet so many other 
professionals contribute to the 
treatments and breakthroughs 
here,” Katie Oppenheim, chair 
of the University’s Professional 
Nurse Council, said in an article 
published 
by 
the 
Michigan 

Nurses 
Association. 
“We 

are concerned that time and 
resources are being squandered 
on 
a 
marketing 
ploy 
that 

ultimately 
diminishes 
the 

contributions of a diverse and 
dedicated staff.”

A petition hosted by UMPNC 

was created in response to the 
new Michigan Medicine title 
and currently has more than 
1,200 signatures.

Armelagos agreed, worried 

the financial aspect of the name 
change could have been better 
applied to patient care.

“This is already a done deal; 

they’re spending I don’t know 
how much money on this 
venture, we don’t believe it’s 
money well spent,” Armelagos 
said.

Despite 
the 
contentious 

decision, nurses at Michigan 
Medicine are still committed to 
patient-centered care.

“The nurses and UMPNC are 

going to continue to advocate 
for our profession, our patients 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
act 

collaboratively with all other 
disciplines for the betterment 
of patient care,” Armelagos 
said. “But the employers’ poor 
decision to rebrand the health 
system does not serve anyone 
well.”

Quality for the study — which 
is slated to cost $2 million 
— the team will work with 
Wayne State University and 
the Detroit Medical Center to 
conduct the experiment in two 
hospitals.

Kaye discussed the gravity of 

the presence of antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria in hospital environments.

“We always think of hand-

washing and how germs can be 
moved by the hands of health 
care workers,” he said. “But the 
environment the patients are in, 
whether it’s the bedrails or the 
telephone, also have organisms 
contaminating 
their 
surfaces 

pretty frequently and living for 
long periods of time.”

Hospital cleaning has always 

been 
a 
crucial 
process 
in 

preventing health care-associated 
infections, 
Kaye 
said. 
When 

a patient is discharged from 
a hospital, a form of intensive 

cleaning called terminal cleaning 
is done to accommodate the next 
patient.

Terminal 
cleaning, 
while 

effective, 
has 
its 
limits 
in 

preventing 
antibiotic-resistant 

organisms 
from 
causing 

infections. C. difficile, for example, 
is a bacterium that causes swelling 
and 
irritation 
in 
the 
colon. 

Terminal cleaning cannot kill this 
bacterium because of its resistance 
to antibiotics.

“In a scenario where a patient 

in a hospital has C. diff and is 
then discharged from a room, 
the next patient to go to that 
room has a much higher risk 
of getting C. diff than someone 
admitted into a different patient 
room,” Kaye said. “So, even 
with good cleaning, there’s a 
question of whether adding 
more intensive disinfection for 
standard cleaning would reduce 
the risk of patients developing 
infections in the hospital.”

Kaye 
explained 
that 
the 

robots 
will 
be 
used 
with 

terminal cleaning in hospital 
rooms 
to 
determine 
their 

effectiveness 
against 
the 

infections.

The robots emit UV light, 

which can be harmful to human 
eyes, skin and immune systems. 
However, they will have a 

function that disables these 
harmful lights in the presence 
of humans.

“The robots will have motion 

sensor that will turn it off if it 

detects motion in the room,” 
Kaye said. “So they are pretty 
much fail-proof.”

Germ-zapping robots have 

been used in other hospitals to 
counter the spread of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria.

Oryan Henig, a research 

fellow who worked on the study 
under the mentorship of Kaye, 
said the uniqueness of this 
study came from its controlled 
design.

“It’s a different epidemiology 

of patients and microbiology, 
and a strong setting of infection 
control system that is required 
to make such a study feasible,” 
Henig said.

The study, which will span 

over two years, will use the 
actual germ-zapping in one 
of the two Detroit hospitals 
and a placebo in the other to 
overcome bias and to evaluate 
the effect of the robots.

“We’ll 
essentially 
be 

comparing terminal cleaning 
to terminal cleaning with the 
germ-zapping 
robots,” 
Kaye 

said.

The women at NASA, Shetterly 

explained, are often overlooked in 
history. Other figures, like Martin 
Luther King Jr., were pushed 
forward by the accomplishments 
of the African-American women 
working at NASA.

“Most people in our country 

think of the civil rights movement 
as something that started in 
1954 with the Brown vs. Board 
of 
Education 
decision 
and 

culminated 
with 
Dr. 
King’s 

speech in 1963 at the march on 
Washington,” Shetterly said. “Dr. 
King stood on the shoulders of 
others to reach his mountaintop.”

Shetterly explored why it has 

taken so long for the story of these 
women to be told. Despite there 
being many women working 
alongside the main characters of 
the story, their contribution has 
still been obscured.

“(There) may have been as 

many 1,000 women … working 
as professional mathematicians,” 
Shetterly said. “Why didn’t we 
use them as role models?”

Shetterly quickly answered 

the question she posed, saying 
the women were hired as sub-
professionals, 
putting 
them 

below men at NASA. However, 
she added that though this was 

true, there were other reasons for 
them being forgotten.

“Women of all backgrounds 

were separated from the men,” 
Shetterly said. “In the beginning, 
the Black women went into the 
west area computing section and 
the white women went into the 
east area office.”

The biggest reason, Shetterly 

concluded, was that computing 
was considered women’s work, 
in comparison to engineering, 
which was a male-dominated 
field.

The 
American 
dream, 

Shetterly said, is something the 
women in the story experienced, 
making the story of the women 
even more important to tell.

“I think the power of the 

American dream is that it too is a 
story, as much myth as it is reality, 
something that we tell ourselves 
about how we live and what we 
believe and what we think is 
possible,” Shetterly said. “This 
is a story about including Black 
women in the American dream.”

Following the lecture, LSA 

sophomore Zi Huang said she 
found the story of the lives of the 
women in the book inspiring.

“Even in times like the 1950s 

there wasn’t even the civil rights 
movement yet,” Huang said. 
“There were women making this 
type of progress and it gives me a 
lot of hope.”

Rackham 
student 
Jasmine 

Jones, a computer scientist, was 
also encouraged by the story.

“I think it was inspiring to 

a lot of people and I think it’s 
going to be a good chance for 
people everywhere to really 
take seriously and thank their 
education and opportunities and 
to really push forward and not 
discount themselves and what 
they can contribute to society,” 
Jones said.

A Q&A after the lecture 

allowed the audience to ask 
questions about contemporary 
segregation and the process 
Shetterly 
went 
through 
in 

researching for and writing her 
book.

“One of the things is that we 

have schools that are segregated 
not just by race, but by income 
and by opportunity and we are 
leaving so much talent on the 
table,” Shetterly said.

Hours after the featured event, 

Shetterly also gave a “fireside 
chat” at Stamps Auditorium. The 
450 seats at the venue were again 
filled to capacity, and many more 
waited outside to be first in line at 
the book signing afterward.

Speaking to the appeal of 

getting the autograph of an idol, 
Shetterly said when she went to 
meet Katherine Johnson –– one of 
the protagonists of the book and 

film

be hesitant and unsure for this 
organization to go forward and 
fund this stuff, because I’m not 
sure what kind of message that 
sends.”

The resolution was tabled for 

later review by the Resolutions 
Committee.

The 
Student 
Organization 

Funding 
Committee 
also 

attended the meeting to clarify its 

funding process to the assembly, 
which was unclear about the 
organization’s role.

According to SOFC Chair 

Kevin Yang, a Business junior, 
the committee is the funding 
body of CSG. However, the 
group was created to operate 
autonomously 
from 
CSG 

because of certain biases that 
representatives 
might 
have. 

Various student organizations 
apply 
to 
SOFC 
to 
receive 

funding for student activities 
and events on a reimbursement 
basis.

It also funds services and 

events, such as the night owl 
bus route and water bottle refill 
stations. For each semester, 
SOFC has about $200,000 to 
give to student organizations.

A year ago during now-

alum 
Cooper 
Charlton’s 

administration, SOFC played 
a critical role when the body 
depleted its financial resources 
a month before the semester 
ended. The former assembly 
passed the resolution to provide 
the commission the emergency 
funds.

O

ne of my New Year’s 
resolutions 
was 
to 

live a life consisting 

of less phone time, including 
checking it less often 
throughout the day. 
Current status: little 
to no progress. At this 
point, all I have done 
is forgotten to bring 
my phone a few times 
when I go to leave 
for class. When I do 
have it, I still check 
it 
directly 
before 

and after my classes, 
during meals and any 
other spare moment in between.

I am addicted to checking 

texts, 
emails, 
Facebook, 

Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, 
weather and every other type 
of 
notification 
or 
app 
that 

can 
immediately 
give 
me 

information on what is going on 
in the world. If my phone screen 
does not light up throughout 
the day, I assume something 
is amiss or I am out of the loop 
that I feel I need to be “in.” Even 
while writing this, I have been 
distracted several times by the 
little blue notification light on 
my phone screen even though I 
know it is an email that does not 
need a reply right now.

As I walk around campus, I 

see I am not the only one whose 
life is driven by the number of 
dings their phone emits every 
day. This lifestyle is what leads to 
publications and blog posts titled 
“I quit social media for a month,” 
as if the act is a life-changing 
moment that the world needs 
to know. But perhaps one of the 
subtlest effects of social media is 
our habits of turning to these sites 
when we have nothing else to do. 
Instead, we should be turning 
to the friends and environment 
around us for inspiration.

This is not an attempt to bash 

social media; there are many 
useful and enjoyable aspects of 
these platforms, and it would be 

hypocritical 
of 
me 

to call for a complete 
ban when I have no 
intention of deleting 
my own accounts any 
time soon. No, this is a 
call to begin resisting 
the urge to check your 
social accounts when 
you have nothing else 
to do. I want you allow 
yourself to be bored.

Traditionally, 
the 

possibility of boredom is seen 
as a negative. There are many 
studies 
suggesting 
boredom 

leads to a decrease in academic 
success; however, there are also 
studies that define several types of 
boredom that have a positive effect 
on individuals. According to one 
study, “indifferent boredom” is 
one such type that leaves someone 
in a calm state with generally 
positive feelings. We must put 
ourselves in these situations. 

When boredom is positive, 

research shows more creativity 
is expressed afterward. In a 
study at the University of Central 
Lancashire, participants involved 
in a boring activity were able 
to report a higher number of 
solutions to a creative problem 
afterward than those who did 
not complete the boring activity. 
Therefore, when we give in to 
our urges to turn to our phone 
when we are not being stimulated 
by something else, we are not 
allowing our later selves to 
generate positive creativity that is 
crucial to success.

There have been many times 

throughout the last few years in 
which adults who are a generation 
or two older have asked me if 
I could ever live without my 

phone. Mostly it has been in a 
joking manner, but I am realizing 
that for many people my age, the 
answer is a terrifying no. I do not 
believe this is solely because we 
are unable to socialize face to face, 
but research shows that social 
gratification can entice a higher 
rate of phone usage.

Many millennials will argue 

filling their bored moments with 
social media and screen time is not 
a waste of time, that they are using 
their resources to scan through 
breaking 
news 
or 
building 

friendships virtually. This may be 
true at times, but often those short 
news clips turn into viral videos 
starring cats and people making 
fools of themselves. This is clearly 
not the best society has to offer.

Knowing this, I propose we 

all have something better to do 
with our boredom. While there 
is no magical activity that will 
inspire greatness in everyone, 
everyone does have something 
else they could be engaged in 
that has higher benefits than 
social media.

I am not suggesting we all 

stop using our social media 
accounts right now and never 
turn back. I am suggesting we 
begin to accept our feelings of 
boredom and turn them toward 
an 
activity 
that 
promotes 

creativity within ourselves. It 
could be reading a book that 
has been on your list for years, 
completing a project you started 
a while ago or even taking a nap. 
Whatever it is, channel all your 
social media urges into this new 
task. A piece of advice: It helps 
if you leave your phone behind 
when you go engage in this 
activity. Trust me, Twitter will 
still be there when you finish.

W

e all know a friend 
or two who grew 
up Catholic but no 

longer associates themselves with 
religion. “What a shame,” an older 
devout Catholic might think, “that 
young people just don’t 
understand life.” What 
we may not realize, 
though, is that this 
generational gap is an 
opportunity for us to 
become good debaters.

Millennials 
have 

been 
labeled 
as 

“the least religious 
generation” 
in 

history. It’s true — 
young 
people 
are 

leaving the church. In fact, 
according 
to 
a 
longitudinal 

research study conducted by 
Jean 
Twenge, 
a 
psychology 

professor at San Diego State 
University, church attendance of 
high-school seniors decreased by 
half from 2000 to 2013, and three 
times as many college students 
don’t 
affiliate 
themselves 

with religion compared to the 
previous generation. What does 
that mean for us?

This brings me back to a 

conversation from last summer I 
had with my uncle, who is a priest. 
“I hope you find meaning in little 
things in life through connection 
with God,” he said in reference 
to a tree. “You’ll find ways to 
do that as you grow older.” The 
trouble with this line of thought 
is that people tend to assume that 
millennials lack empathy and fail 
to seek meaning in life — if I don’t 
pray before dinner, do I fail to 
express gratitude?

Twenge finds that millennials’ 

decline in religious involvement 
is not age-dependent. Instead, 
she suggests that it may be due 
to a cultural rise of individualism 
of our modern generation. In 
an individualistic society, there 
is less desire to conform and a 
greater attempt to maintain sense 
of self. But we fail to recognize 
this fact in practice.

From 
conversations 
with 

friends, I find that many students 
avoid talking about their non-

religiousness in their Catholic 
homes. 
Maybe 
their 
devout 

Catholic grandparents wouldn’t 
understand; they don’t know 
how to bring it up or they just 
don’t care. But the main reason 

appears 
to 
reside 

in our tendency to 
circumvent conflict. A 
friend once remarked, 
“My dad told me that 
two things I should 
avoid talking about 
with 
people 
are 

politics and religion.”

I personally have 

experienced 
this 

ambivalence myself. I 
grew up in a Catholic 

household, but my relationship 
with Catholicism grew tenuous 
over the years, especially when I 
first took biology in college. The 
very first day, as the professor 
explained the fundamentals of 
evolution, he stated, “There is no 
such thing as God.”

The 
students’ 
reactions 

were divided. Some people 
reacted adversely, while some 
others, like me, were intrigued 
by his bluntness.

Throughout 
the 
course, 
I 

became engrossed in biology and 
understanding the universe as a 
scientist, a passion that may be 
looked down upon by some devout 
Catholics. As Dr. Kalanithi writes, 
“I, like most scientific types, came 
to believe in the possibility of a 
material conception of reality.” 
However, by viewing life in the 
Darwinian sense that life has no 
higher purpose, I grew up torn 
between the scientific mind and 
desire to foster love; between 
respect for my family’s beliefs and 
having my own voice.

As I lived my conflict, I 

began to initiate conversations 
with my own family. I told my 
parents the things I learned 
about evolution, while they 
reminded 
me 
about 
the 

importance 
of 
fundamental 

human 
experiences 
such 

as hope, love, suffering and 
striving. By doing so, I realized 
that my preference to leave 
my church was not due to lack 

of purpose and meaning, but 
rather quite the opposite.

It was in these discussions 

with my parents that I began to 
recognize 
the 
complementary 

aspects of science and religion. 
I have come to realize that we 
need an anti-Darwinian society, 
as Richard Dawkins suggests. 
We need to learn evolution 
to understand why we exist, 
but we should not live by it. 
Understanding evolution can help 
us learn what to avoid in human 
life — how to uplift those who need 
it most and not cast them aside.

But, are religion and science 

even in conflict? According to Pew 
Research, the famous religion 
versus science debate may still be 
relevant. Six out of 10 adults express 
the view that scientific knowledge 
and religion are at odds with each 
other, especially on the topic of the 
creation of the universe.

Michael Evans, a research 

associate 
at 
Dartmouth 

College, provides an interesting 
perspective: 
“Public 
conflict 

involving religion and science 
reflects a fundamental conflict 
over good debate.” In making 
this comment, Evans urges us to 
talk to one another to not only 
advance our own positions, but 
more importantly, to listen to 
one another.

To 
better 
engage 
older 

generations 
and 
millennials, 

I find it that we need to begin 
these conversations at dinner, 
which is the place people avoid 
talking about religion the most. 
To remind us the importance of 
argument, Megyn Kelly writes 
in her book “Settle for More,” “I 
believe in the right to offend. To 
insult. Even to horrify. It’s not 
that we’re supposed to enjoy it, 
it’s that we’re supposed to allow 
it and then respond in a more 
persuasive voice.”

Avoiding 
conflict 
is 

counterproductive 
to 
our 

education. 
Let’s 
become 

better debaters, starting at the 
dinner table.

Tribute to Granny: An American Muslim

MICHIGAN IN COLOR

W

e sat in her hospital 
room, just my granny 
and me, as she told 

me about her solar technology 
patent. The topic transported 
her mind from her blue gown 
lit by fluorescent lighting to her 
classroom at Virginia Tech. A 
well-prepared lecture evolved 
out of her weak speech as my 
visitor’s chair turned into a desk. 
Like a song from her childhood, 
she rhythmically told me about 
sputtering techniques and thin 
film solar converters. Upon 
forgetting just one colleague’s 
name, she looked at me and 
laughed at her “old mind.” On 
Jan. 8, 2017, my brilliant granny 
passed away after a lifetime of 
teaching. Her greatest lesson 
to me will be how to be an 
outstanding 
citizen 
and 
an 

amazing Muslim.

Lubna Razia Ijaz was born 

in 1936 in Lahore, Pakistan. By 
the time she began studying 
at 
Government 
College 
in 

Lahore, she had already skipped 
multiple grades. I remember 
her telling me stories of being 
one of the few girls in her class. 
Once, a male classmate asked 
her why she didn’t wear the 
Islamic headscarf, to which she 
responded, “Are you a girl? Why 
do you care?” That classmate 
would go on to marry my granny 
and become my grandfather.

The two lovebirds moved to 

Florida in 1960 to pursue higher 
education. I cannot begin to 
imagine the possible instances 
of prejudice they must have 
faced coming into America’s 
civil rights era as people of color. 
Perhaps this is because she never 
told her grandchildren stories 
of prejudice. She only depicted 
the America that welcomed 
her with grace and respect. 
Her hallmark story from the 
Florida days is how she and my 
grandfather presented a Quran 
to the president of Florida State 
University, Gordon Blackwell.

In 1965 the two moved to 

Virginia. But it wasn’t just 
Virginia — it was Blacksburg, 
Virginia, a town neighbored 
by 
Christiansburg 
and 

Lynchburg. Take a second to 
imagine the mindsets of my 
grandparents’ 
townspeople. 

Their 
presence 
was 
so 

revolutionary 
that 
a 
local 

newspaper photographed my 
grandparents with the title, 
“These are Moslems.”

However, rather than being 

discouraged by the apparent 
obstacles to inclusion, they 
were excited to be involved in 
the community and the culture. 
Coming from the villages of the 
Punjab, my grandparents had a 
deep love of the land, which was 
a central part of the Virginian 
lifestyle. As a result, every visit 
to Virginia is filled with fingers 
pointing from the car windows 
at the acres and acres of land my 
grandparents developed.

While she was cultivating 

both her family and the Virginian 
landscape, my granny pursued 
her Ph.D. in solar physics and 
education from Virginia Tech. It 
makes me so optimistic to know 
that she earned her doctoral 
degree at a time when less than 
5 percent of all Ph.D.s in physics 
were awarded to women. She 
fervently believed in the Islamic 
principles 
of 
education 
for 

everyone, not just males, and 
led by example in the American 
education scene.

Her 
dedication 
to 
her 

faith was evident when she 
took office as president of 
the women’s auxiliary of the 
Ahmadiyya Muslim Community 
USA from 1969 to 1971. The 
Ahmadiyya Muslim Community 
is 
America’s 
oldest 
Muslim 

community, established in 1920. 
Three of the first 313 adherents 
to the Ahmadiyyat were my 
granny’s 
father, 
grandfather 

and 
great-grandfather. 
They 

were some of the first members 
of 
a 
revolutionary 
social 

movement, founded by Mirza 
Ghulam 
Ahmad 
of 
Qadian, 

India, 
championing 
“Love 

for all, hatred for none.” It’s 
inspiring that she took her 
deeply rooted spirituality and 
put it to practical use in order 
to help empower women in the 
early ’70s.

In addition to her work 

with the women’s auxiliary, 
she was constantly looking for 
opportunities to develop the 
American Muslim community. 
In 
1983, 
my 
grandparents 

sought to build a mosque for 
Muslims in the surrounding 
states. An newspaper titled 
“Islam in Virginia” says the 
mosque was being established 
in “the heart of the ‘Bible 
belt,’ 
” 
underscoring 
the 

adversity of its construction. 
Due to financial issues the 
mosque project was never fully 
completed, but her disregard 
for possible cultural roadblocks 
inspires me to this day.

Practicing Islam was never 

an inhibitor to her acceptance 
into society. In today’s political 
rhetoric, Muslims are often 
made out to seem incompatible 
to the American way of life. 
During the second presidential 
debate 
in 
October 
2016, 

President Trump called for an 
extreme vetting of Muslims. 
The goal of this kind of rhetoric 
is to say Muslims and Americans 
don’t, can’t and won’t mix. But 
my granny is clear evidence 
that the only thing “extreme” 
is the extreme lack of conflict 
between being Muslim and 
being American.

For example, I would often 

imagine what it was like being in 
my granny’s classroom. What was 
it like learning from her with her 
South Asian accent and Pakistani 
saris? Apparently, it was great! 
In 1976, Lubna Ijaz was awarded 
a Woman of the Year award 
in education by Montgomery 
County, Va. Her breakthrough 
teaching 
styles 
emphasized 

the 
practical 
applications 
of 

physics and reduced the stress 
on examinations for students. 
My uncle often tells me that she 
would pass out physics exams 
with the answers attached, tell 
her students her assessment was 
of concepts, not equations. In 
1996 she established a Virginia 
Tech scholarship in her name to 
annually award a student who 
“has shown great commitment 
to the science of physics.”

It 
was 
no 
surprise 
that 

students loved socializing with 
my granny. One photograph 
shows 
my 
granny, 
wearing 

traditional 
shalwar 
kameez, 

standing in the family apple 
orchard surrounded by her 
students, all adorned in high-
waisted bell-bottoms.

I love that photograph. It 

shows me that cultures and 
religions are not obstacles to 
unity. Cultural differences and 
religious diversity are necessary 
for a society to progress and 
prosper. That single photograph 
shows me that being an American 
Muslim is not an oxymoron, 
but a beautiful indicator of 
society moving towards a bright 
future. More than anything, that 
photograph shows me that my 
granny was an American Muslim 
woman, unafraid of any obstacles 
to unity, ready to break glass 
ceilings and win over the hearts 
of her fellow Virginians.

Hot Takes: Thoughts on the 

2017 Oscar nominations

It’s “La La Land” ’s world 

and we’re all just living in it.

Early yesterday morning, 

while 
you 
were 
sleeping 

through your 8 A.M., the 
Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences released 
their nominations for the 89th 
Oscars, including 
14 
nominations 

for 
Damien 

Chazelle’s 
“millennial 
musical.” 
The 

only other films 
to land that many 
nominations are 
“All About Eve” 
and 
“Titanic,” 

both 
of 
which 

took 
home 
the 

centerpiece Best 
Picture award in 
their 
respective 

years.

So, 
“La 
La 

Land” 
is 
good. 

After the film cleaned up at 
the Golden Globes earlier this 
month (walking away with 
the award in each category 
for which it was nominated), 
it wasn’t a surprise to see its 
name all over the Oscar list.

There were some nice little 

surprises. 
Lucas 
Hedge’s 

Supporting Actor nomination 
for his role in “Manchester 
by the Sea” comes to mind, 
as does the screenplay for 
“The 
Lobster” 
by 
Yorgos 

Lanthimos. Both are unlikely 
to take home a statue, but 
deserve to keep company with 
the other nominees.

There were some bizarre 

surprises 
like 
Hollywood 

pariah 
Mel 
Gibson 
being 

brought back into the light 
with a Best Director nom and 
the complete vacancy of the 
controversial “The Birth of 
a Nation,” a film which, this 
time last year, was already 
being praised as a Best Picture 
frontrunner. In other odd, 
record-breaking news, “OJ: 
Made in America” became the 
longest film ever nominated, 
at a whopping 467 minutes.

Similarly, some expected 

names were missing from the 

list. Amy Adams and Ralph 
Fiennes (for “Arrival” and “A 
Bigger Splash” respectively) 
both 
gave 
performances 

I 
thought 
deserving 
of 

nomination. Especially since 
both have climbed to the top 
of the Hollywood without 

picking up a golden 
statue along the way.

What 
was 
really 

surprising 
though 

— a rather relieving 
surprise — was how 
diverse the top of the 
ballot was. After last 
year’s 
Oscars 
were 

strikingly white, there 
was worry in the film 
community (or at least 
people on twitter) that 
this 
year’s 
awards 

would similarly ignore 
the contributions of 
actors and filmmakers 
of color. 

It would be easy 

(and I’ve heard it said already) 
to say that the Oscars are no 
longer “so White.” They’re 
noticeably 
less 
White, 

especially 
in 
the 
acting 

categories. Six Black actors are 
nominated this year—setting a 
record. Mahershala Ali seems 
to be the frontrunner in the 
Supporting 
Actor 
category 

and Viola Davis is a lock-
in for Supporting Actress. 
Additionally, three of the films 
nominated for Best Picture 
(“Moonlight,” “Fences,” and 
“Hidden 
Figures”) 
center 

around a predominantly Black 
cast. However, while Black 
actors stepped further into the 
spotlight, Asian and Latinx 
performances were noticably 
missing, 
with 
Dev 
Patel 

picking up the only nomination 
for an Asian performer for his 
role in “Lion.”

But there’s still a huge race 

disparity 
in 
the 
technical 

categories. 
Bradford 

Young, 
who 
is 
nominated 

for the cinematography in 
“Arrival” is the first Black 
cinematographer 
ever 

nominated for the award—a 
tragedy 
intensified 
when 

you realize he’s the same 

guy 
responsible 
for 
the 

stunning 
cinematography 

in “Selma,” for which he 
was snubbed a nomination. 
In an interview with Ava 
DuVernay, who he worked 
with on “Selma,” he notes that 
he is only the seventh Black 
cinematographer 
inducted 

into the American Society of 
Cinematographers.

One 
exception 
is 
the 

Documentary 
Feature 

category—four 
out 
of 
the 

five directors of the films 
nominated are Black. And, 
even better, these directors 
are all also producers on their 
films, meaning they’ll get to 
walk away with a statuette if 
their film’s win.

So the Oscars are still pretty 

White and, more specifically, 
dominated by White men. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
only 

categories in which we can see 
women regularly nominated 
are Best Actress and Best 
Supporting Actress.

There are, yet again, no 

women nominated for the 
award for Best Directing. Only 
one woman, Allison Schroeder 
who 
co-wrote 
“Hidden 

Figures” 
with 
Theodore 

Melfi, was nominated in the 
writing categories (for which 
there are ten nominees). The 
only woman nominated in 
the editing category is Joi 
McMillon, who is nominated 
alongside her partner Nat 
Sanders for their work on 
“Moonlight.” 
McMillon 
is 

also the first Black woman 
nominated in this category.

That there are women and 

people of color nominated 
in these categories is an 
improvement from past award 
shows, 
but 
their 
limited 

numbers seems to hint to a 
larger deficit in Hollywood 
on 
non-White, 
non-male 

filmmakers. Hollywood has 
gotten better—at least a little 
better—at 
making 
movies 

about women and people of 
color, but fares less well when 
it comes to the other side of 
the camera.

On Sunday night, the sight at 

Detroit’s El Club is impossible 
to miss: At 8:00 PM, hundreds 
of 
twenty-somethings 
lined 

up for blocks, eagerly awaiting 
Isaiah 
Rashad, 
Top 
Dawg 

Entertainment’s 
young 
rap 

prodigy. The changeable letters 
on the announcement board 
show two words beneath the 
Tennessee-raised 
rapper’s 

name: SOLD OUT.

For fans standing in line, 

the words are unsurprising: 
Isaiah Rashad is a technically-
profound, critically-acclaimed 
emcee with a cultish following, 
and 2016 was his biggest year 
yet. Rashad released his second 
album, The Sun’s Tirade, in 
September, and due to the 
massive success of his debut 
LP, Cilvia Demo, which came 
out in 2014, his fanbase and 
creative space were already 
well-established.

At the meet and greet, where 

I had a chance to stop by, 
about 100 people were lined 
up, and the rapper received 
each one with a smile, an 
organic embrace and warmth, 
so much so that it was easy to 
forget they were his paying 
customers. Standing aside the 
merchandise table — because 
that’s where the best lighting 
is — he poses for photo after 
photo while his peer acts as a 
cameraman, shuffling through 
endless fans’ iPhones as each 
one stands with the star.

For the most genuine fans, 

the real-life interactions looked 
emotional, moving and, above 
all else, memorable. Rashad’s 
followers 
feel 
personally 

connected 
to 
him 
because 

he offers himself wholly and 
unashamedly in his lyrics. He 
publicly wrestles with drug-
dependency 
and 
depression 

in some songs but, even then, 
there’s no embarrassment in 
his inflection: He is a confident, 
hyper-aware 
storyteller 

spitting parables for people to 
struggle with and learn from. 
Life is often troublesome but, 
in 
Isaiah 
Rashad’s 
music, 

forward-movement is the end 
goal. So, for his most dedicated 
fans, meeting him is something 
like meeting Superman.

Among the crowd of early-

enterers is LSA junior Vincent 
Haze, wearing a University of 
Michigan long-sleeve t-shirt 
and waiting to meet with the 
rapper. Haze is at the show 
with Anthony Ellis, a friend 
he grew up with in Ann Arbor, 
and though the two of them 
have been listening to Isaiah 
Rashad’s music since 2013, 
neither has seen him perform 
live. When I ask if they’re fans 
of Top Dawg Entertainment 
— the record label that hosts 
Rashad, 
Kendrick 
Lamar, 

Schoolboy Q, SZA and others 
— they confirm my suspicion. 
“That would be putting it 
lightly,” one says. TDE loyalty 
is common in this crowd.

Some time around 10:00 

P.M., Jay IDK — a Maryland-
raised newcomer with a lot of 

grit and energy — popped on 
stage to open the show, but 
not before his DJ turned the 
standing room into a mosh pit 
by asking, “D-town, what the 
fuck is up?” and leading off 
with the Migos’ party catalyst, 
“Bad and Boujee.”

Jay IDK walked out wearing 

a rubber Ronald Reagan mask 
for a creative skit built on one 
of his most defining lyrics: 
“The Reagan Era put a fucking 
voice in my head,” he raps 
on the crack-thrilled song, 
“The Plug (King Trappy III).” 
Though he goes on to glorify 
the salesmanship and slyness 
of successful drug dealers, the 
introductory line remains the 
root of the story: The Reagan 
Era turned naive kids into 
criminals. Or, at least, it did 
according to Jay IDK. But 
that’s his whole shtick: The 
IDK stands for “Ignorantly 
Delivering Knowledge,” so you 
should expect him to rap with 
thorough theses and to deliver 
hot takes.

“Mentality” was next on 

the setlist, but it wouldn’t 
arrive 
without 
another 

clever 
performance: 
First 

the DJ shocked the crowd by 
playing “Bye, Bye, Bye” by 
N’Sync, setting Jay IDK up 

to explain that he can’t bring 
his DJ anywhere because he 
always “fucks it up.” Jay then 
played “Mentality,” on which 
“fucking things up” is an 
ongoing theme, and the whole 
thing proved to be a bit. “She 
Blocked Me” and “I Picture” 
came next, followed by a 
heartfelt accapella verse on 
which Jay IDK found himself 
watching “The Breakfast Club” 
and wondering, “How can I 
get in the conversation?” He 
closed with “God Said Trap,” 
two performances of “Boy’s 
Innocence” and a wild leap into 
the crowd, where he turned up 
with the rowdiest attendees. 
By the time Jay IDK walked off 
stage, the venue’s volume was 
at its maximum and a handful 
of unsure attendees had surely 
been converted into fans.

11 
P.M. 
rolls 
around, 

and 
a 
“T-T-T-T-Top 
Dawg 

Entertainment” 
soundbite 

comes erupting through the 
speakers as DJ Chris Calor 
emerges to ask the packed, 
excited room, “Do y’all fuck 
with 
TDE?” 
After 
playing 

Kendrick’s 
“M.A.A.D. 
City” 

and A$AP Ferg’s “New Level,” 
with the energy peaking, Isaiah 
Rashad emerged. In-person, 
he’s shorter than expected 
(shorter than me, and I am only 
5’9”), but on stage he’s larger 
than life and able to command 
the crowd like a legendary 
figure. A huge chunk of the 
audience knew every word to 
every song (though his music is 

seldom played on the radio) and 
the small club felt just enough 
like a basement to create a real 
hip-hop illusion (think the last 
scene in “8 Mile”).

Isaiah Rashad thrived off 

of the energy. He opened with 
“Smile,” a single from 2016, 
then tore through “Brenda,” 
“Soliloquy,” and “Dressed Like 
Rappers” before sandwiching a 
seemingly improvised singsong 
about hydrating via drinking 
water in between “R.I.P. Kevin 
Miller” and “Tity and Dolla.” 
His songs range from chilled-
out, flowing rap to angsty, 
aggressive gangster music, but 
it’s his conscious which creates 
the cohesion.

By the end of “Heavenly 

Father” 
and 
“Rosegold,” 

Rashad was so worked up that 
he had to change his sweat-
soaked 
shirt. 
“Menthol,” 

“Stuck In The Mud” and “4r 
Da Squaw” came next, with 
the rapper pushing forward at 
a rapid pace that demonstrated 
both immense professionalism 
and 
and 
an 
eagerness 
to 

appease every type of fan. 
He jumped back into older 
hits, playing “Ronnie Drake,” 
“Webbie Flow,” “Banana” and 
even “Shout You Down” and 
then closed with a string from 
his The Sun’s Tirade.

Considering 
the 
concert 

kicked 
off 
with 
an 
artist 

wearing 
a 
Ronald 
Reagan 

mask, 
the 
night 
unraveled 

rather apolitically, especially 
for a conscious rap show that 
occurred 
on 
the 
weekend 

of 
Donald 
J. 
Trump’s 

inauguration. 
Early 
in 
the 

night, between the sets of Jay 
IDK and Isaiah Rashad, a DJ 
onstage claimed to be curious 
if the crowd “felt the same 
way” as him about a current 
issue, then proceeded to play 
“F*ck Donald Trump” by YG, a 
protest rap that’s been earning 
a lot of attention recently. For a 
while, it seemed like that might 
have been the most pointed 
commentary of the night.

But at the close of his 

set, after he had finished 
performing all of his own songs 
and was simply thanking the 
crowd for coming out, Isaiah 
Rashad bopped and moved 
with the attendees as Kendrick 
Lamar’s “Alright,” an anthem 
of empowerment that seeks out 
positivity in darkness, blasted 
through the venue’s amplifiers. 
In that moment, his genuine 
engagement spoke louder than 
any prepared statement could 
have.

Isaiah 
Rashad 
is 
an 

evolutionary figure, a human 
who has struggled (like all do), 
both privately and in lyric, yet 
has 
remained 
unswervingly 

focused 
on 
continuing 
to 

grow, 
both 
personally 
and 

artistically. The Lil Sunny Tour 
is his largest headlining effort 
yet, and he’s fought for this 
moment his entire life. No one 
can take it away from him — 
not even the president. Isaiah 
Rashad is “gon’ be alright.” As 
a matter of fact, he’s going to be 
more than that.

‘Good Place’ ends on high note 

Serialization in sitcoms is a 

rare thing. Most, while they do 
have 
continuous 

arcs, focus on a 
singular 
story 

each week. Still, 
many sitcoms are 
at their best when 
they allow stories 
to gain momentum 
over 
time. 
This 

is 
especially 

prevalent in sitcoms 
created by Michael 
Schur, creator of 
“Brooklyn Nine Nine” and “Parks 
and Rec.” The former started its 
fall hot streak with a brilliant 
three-parter that benefitted from 
the extra time and the latter 
thrived in the narrative arc (with 
my favorite example being Leslie 
running for city council). In each 
case, the alternative strucute paid 
off as it built over the course of 
several episodes. However, no 
network sitcom this year has been 
as serialized as NBC’s “The Good 
Place.” The comedy wrapped 
up its first season with a finale 
that built off the work that came 
before it to create an ending that 
blew open possibilities for season 
two in an incredibly exciting way.

As “The Good Place” winded 

through 
its 
first 
season, 
it 

constructed a story that was 
as twisty as it was intriguing. 
It burned through its plot with 
abandon. Moments that would 
normally come at the end of the 
season were happening halfway 
through. It started off with a 

problem: 
Eleanor 
Shellstrop 

(Kristen Bell, “Veronica Mars”) 
ended up in the “Good Place” 
(the show’s non-denominational 
heaven) even though she acted 
horribly to the people in her life 
on Earth (like how she left her 

friend’s dog she 
was 
supposed 

to feed to go to a 
Rihanna concert). 
She 
meets 
her 

“soulmate,” 
Chidi 
(William 

Jackson 
Harper, 

“The 
Electric 

Company”) 
who 

quickly 
became 

one of TV’s best 
straight men, her 

proudly philanthropic neighbor 
Tahani (Jameela Jamil, “T4”) 
and Jason Mendoza (Manny 
Jacinto, “The Romeo Section”), 
a Floridian DJ who is mistaken 
for a Buddhist monk. As she 
reveals herself and her past life 
to the “neighborhood,” the show 
continued to move forward with 
compelling plot points at every 
turn.

With its narrative momentum, 

“The 
Good 
Place” 
’s 
finale 

produced a twist that completely 
changed the fabric of the show. 
While the characters struggle 
with the decision of who to send 
to the torturous “Bad Place,” 
wEleanor realizes that they have 
been in the Bad Place all along, in 
a world perfectly built such that 
the core cast tortures each other. 
It’s the kind of twist that makes 
me rethink the show I’ve been 
watching for an entire season, as 
it’s both shocking and sensible. 
Of course these people were 
placed together to torture each 

other. Ted Danson’s (“Cheers”) 
ridiculous smile as he’s revealed 
to be an evil architect is about as 
laugh-inducing as comedy can get. 
The twist sets up a second season 
where the core cast’s memory is 
wiped and they are split apart, 
with Eleanor leaving herself a 
note to “find Chidi.” A season 
where the core cast will have to 
navigate their hell and find each 
other sounds like something “The 
Good Place” will do well.

Not only is the show’s use of 

serialization fascinating, it’s also 
a fun show to watch. Following 
in the footsteps of “Parks” and 
“Brooklyn,” there’s a certain light-
hearted nature to everything 
that happens. The characters 
clearly care about one another, 
and it shows in their interactions, 
which the series mines for humor 
so well. The relationship between 
Jason and the neighborhood’s 
robot assistant, Janet (D’Arcy 
Carden, “Broad City”), put two 
characters 
together 
to 
great 

results. There were so many great 
jokes in the finale about the two 
of them trying to have sex that 
wouldn’t have worked if we didn’t 
get to know these characters 
throughout the season.

The character work and light 

tone makes “The Good Place” 
special. Add in the captivating 
twists 
along 
with 
strong 

performances, and NBC has one 
of the best comedies on television. 
However, the network hasn’t 
renewed the show for a second 
season yet. The ratings are not 
bad by any stretch, but they’re 
not good enough that a pickup is 
guaranteed. Still, the finale set 
up a fascinating season two that I 
really hope NBC gives us.

A note on hidden spaces

On Saturday, January 21st 

at the 2017 Women’s March 
on Washington, artist Janelle 
Monáe stood before an ever-
growing crowd and stated: “I 
am so proud to stand here as a 
woman, an African-American 
woman; 
my 
grandmother 

was 
a 
sharecropper. 
She 

picked cotton in Aberdeen, 
Mississippi. My mother was a 
janitor, and I am a descendent 
of them, and I am here, in their 
honor, to help us move forward 
and fem the future.”

Even though I traveled to 

D.C. to witness the historic 
march, 
I, 
unfortunately, 

was not able to see Monáe’s 
powerful speech in person; 
stuck on a metro train caught 
in a three-hour delay due to 
the sheer number of people 
making their way into the city, 
I was only able to hear Monáe’s 
words after the march had 
ended, stretching out sore legs 
in my aunt’s house. There I was 
surrounded by my family, all 
of whom are immigrants. All 
marched underneath the blank 
slate of the cloudy sky for their 
rights, both as women, and as 
immigrant women.

It was there that I listened to 

Monáe’s voice blast out of tiny 
computer 
speakers, 
talking 

about her pride to march both 
as a woman and as an African-
American 
woman: 
Enfolded 

by the faces of women whose 
femininity enclosed a duality.

In 1989, civil rights activist 

Kimberlé 
Crenshaw 
coined 

the 
term 
“intersectionality” 

as she studied the overlap 
between 
race 
and 
gender. 

In her prominent essay, she 
focused on the struggle of 
Black women, stating that the 
discrimination they experience 
does not fall deftly into the 
categories of either “racism” 
or “sexism,” but rather, due 
to their converging identities 
of 
being 
both 
“African-

American” and “woman,” is a 
combination of the two. From 
there, intersectionality grew to 
become generally known as the 
concurrence of multiple social 
identities and the consequent 
surrounding 
systems 
of 

discrimination and oppression.

Monáe’s 
song 
that 
she 

performed 
at 
the 
march, 

“Hell You Talmbout,” brings 
to light the conflict that can 
exist within the intersection 
of being Black and being a 
woman. A majority of the song 
simply lists the names of the 
many Black women unfairly 
killed by the police followed 
by a repeated chant of “say 
her name,” as a reference 
to the recent #SayHerName 
movement; while the names 
of the Black men illegally and 
immorally 
killed 
by 
police 

forces have started to gain 
national attention (like Eric 
Garner 
or 
Freddie 
Gray) 

the names of these women 
(like Sandra Bland or Mya 
Hall) are much less well-
known, pointing to the idea 
that there is an invisibility in 
intersectionality; within their 
bisecting identities, the unjust 
and inequitable crimes against 
Black women have become 
excluded and hidden from the 
public eye.

The 
inclusivity 
and 

recognition of intersectionality 
in mainstream feminism is 
necessary, especially from the 
women who do not share the 
same conflicts and experiences. 
The issue of unfair violence and 
police brutality against Black 
women does not include White 
women; part of the way we can 
help include the perspectives 
of black women in mainstream 
feminism is by making sure our 
voices are never raised louder 
than the women of color who 
are affected daily.

However, 
America 
has 

never had a positive history 
of creating equal spaces for 
marginalized groups to feel 
comfortable 
speaking 
in 

without the threat of being 
pushed to the side.

The music scene, specifically, 

has always been a platform for 
social change, especially for 
the progression of women’s 
rights. However, within that 
context, there has previously 
been 
a 
monopolization 
of 

recognition 
and 
relevancy. 

Especially within third-wave 
feminism, White women have 
been primarily thought of as 
the instigators of the infusion 
of feminist ideals in music, 
creating a space where female 
artists of color have either 
been talked over or ignored 
completely.

When looking at the history 

of 
music 
and 
feminism, 

the 
second-wave 
feminism 

movement 
that 
started 
in 

the early 1960’s and lasted 
throughout 
the 
late 
’80s 

was 
relatively 
restricted, 

both in terms of how little 
it leaked into pop culture 
and how little it included 
marginalized groups. However, 
in the sequential third-wave 
feminism movement beginning 
in the early ’90s, borders 
became much more relaxed, 
and the movement began to 
cross boundaries, bleeding into 
music, art and public discourse. 
Third-wave feminism took on a 
more individualistic approach 
to 
feminism; 
it 
critiqued 

second-wave 
feminism 
for 

being 
exclusively 
White, 

middle-class women, and tried 
to alter the term “feminist” to 
fit a more inclusive definition.

While the third-wave did 

embrace the importance of 
intersectionality 
in 
theory, 

this 
openness 
was 
not 

always 
directly 
translated 

into 
practice. 
Third-wave 

feminism’s 
materialization 

in music is still considered a 
primarily White woman effort, 
with the overwhelmingly all-
White riot grrrl movement 
taking up most of the spotlight 
during the ’90s. Bands like 
Bikini Kill and Sleater-Kinney 
explored 
the 
empowerment 

of female sexuality in their 
music, 
redefining 
what 
it 

meant 
to 
be 
empowered 

through 
aggressively 
and 

explicitly calling attention to 
their own female sexuality. 
The 
problem 
arises 
when 

this particular expression of 
female empowerment during 
the ’90s is considered the only 
expression of emancipation. 
And it usually is, with many 
people solely noticing the riot 
grrrl movement, linking it to 
the girl power of the Spice 
Girls in the early 2000s and 
completely ignoring the efforts 
of artists of color; bands like 
TLC and Destiny’s Child, while 
well-known, were not given 

the same revolutionarily and 
radically feminist status as 
the riot grrrl bands, despite 
sharing the same timeline and 
emergence.

Part of it has to do with the 

fact that these divergent bands 
came from different genres of 
music, but part of it also has 
to do with the fact that riot 
grrrl’s (and, more generally, 
White 
women’s) 
expression 

of female empowerment was 
considered the principal form 
of expression; the zine-filled 
clamor of angry performances 
where lead singers stripped 
themselves 
down 
to 
solely 

bras turned into the face of 
third-wave feminism in music, 
overlooking 
the 
fact 
that 

empowerment read differently 
for women of different races; 
women of color had (and still 
have) a harder time portraying 
themselves as agents of their 
own 
empowered 
sexuality 

because of how they have 
historically been painted as 
hyper-sexual and debauched 
in comparison to the pure and 
innocuous standard of white 
femininity. 

Ignoring 
the 
role 
of 

intersectionality, 
and 
the 

subsequent 
stigma 
that 

surrounded artists of color as 
they strove to find their place 
during the sexual revolution 
of third-wave feminism, can 
lead to the emphasis of the 
accomplishments 
of 
White 

women while simultaneously 
viewing 
the 
activities 
of 

women of color as merely 
contributions, if not inadequate 
representations 
of 
female 

empowerment.

Principally: to ignore the 

many 
different 
forms 
and 

voices 
feminism 
can 
take, 

both inside and outside the 
realm of music, has the power 
to 
distance, 
ostracize 
and 

suppress. It is an issue that 
did not die out in the ’90s and 
still is extremely prevalent 
today. In fact, as the Women’s 
March on Washington began to 
gain more and more attention, 
apprehensions began to rise 
as well, with many women of 
color wondering if the steps 
of the Capitol on January 21st 
would be a space reserved 
mostly for White women or a 
space inclusive of all identities.

It is a concern born out of 

a history of marginalization, 
and a concern I held myself as 
I considered the multi-faceted 
identity of my own family. 
However, as I saw Janelle 
Monáe’s commanding rendition 
of “Hell You Talmbout,” as I 
saw Alicia Keys standing tall 
as she honored all the different 
ways 
femininity 
can 
be 

expressed, as I saw posters of 
all varieties champion for the 
recognition and celebration of 
Black women, Hispanic women, 
Muslim women, undocumented 
women and LGBTQ women, my 
apprehensions slowly began to 
fade away.

While the current situation 

for 
minority 
women, 

specifically for women of color, 
is far from perfect, the relative 
inclusivity of the Women’s 
March on Washington (though 
far from perfect itself) gives 
rise to hope: both within music 
and within the overall social 
sphere of feminism. Women of 
all distinctive individualities 
are moving to march forward, 
not back.

Yost Ice Arena: A Michigan hockey tradition

Eight thousand, four hundred 

and eleven people filed their 
way into Yost Ice Arena back on 
January 29th, 1988. It was the 
highest attendance for a single 
hockey game in the building’s 
history.

At 
the 
time, 
maximum 

capacity for Yost was listed as 
8,100. But Michigan State was 
rolling in from East Lansing, 
and no one wanted to miss it. 
So, an extra 311 people crammed 
their way into one of college 
ice hockey’s most traditional 
buildings for a genuine in-state 
rivalry showdown.

Due to multiple renovations 

over the years, Yost’s capacity 
has decreased to 5,800. The 
average number of attendees for 
the 2015-16 season was 5,457 — 
a far cry from 8,411, but enough 
to topple over a 90% attendance 
rate.

Sophomore 
defenseman 

Nicholas Boka can attest to that 
kind of atmosphere after last 
weekend’s matchup against the 
Spartans.

“I 
keep 
using 
the 
word 

special, but it’s really special,” 
Boka said. “Seeing a huge 
crowd the other night playing 
Michigan State when we’re a 
.500 team. … It’s definitely an 
honor to play here.”

Established in 1923 as a 

multi-purpose athletic facility, 
the Fielding H. Yost Field 
House was originally home to 
an eight-lane running track, 
a 
portable 
basketball 
court 

and a winter practice facility 
for the baseball and football 
teams — all while leaving room 
for 7,500 spectators. It also 
provided locker room space 
and conditioning facilities to 
the football teams of Michigan 
football coach Bo Schembechler.

This was the facility Michigan 

hockey coach Red Berenson 
remembers during his first few 

visits to Yost.

“I was in school, and I came 

to a track meet. It was an indoor 
track meet and Tom Robinson 
was a runner,” said Berenson. 
“He was a friend of mine; he was 
from the Bahamas. He broke the 
world record for the 60-yard 
dash indoors here, at the time. …
And then I came to a basketball 
game here. I actually came for 
a baseball tryout my freshman 
year, might’ve been the first 
time I was in the building. They 
gave us an old ball to play catch 
with and that was about the 
extent of the tryout.”

About 10 years later, the 

Fielding H. Yost Field House 
began converting into an ice 
arena. It maintained most of the 
original architectural aspects, 
including 
the 
recognizable 

grand 
windows 
and 
drafty 

ceiling.

Consistently referred to as 

a “barn,” the hockey facility 
boasts an incredible record 
since its transition to a rink in 
1973. Not including the current 
season, 819 games have been 
played at Yost Ice Arena, and 
holds a win-loss-tie record of 
570-209-40. Attendance peaked 
during 2003-04 season, when 
148,124 people made their way 
into Yost to watch Michigan 
play hockey.

Yet, more incredibly, over four 

million people have attended 
Yost during its 43 seasons as a 
hockey arena.

“I had no idea what it would 

turn out to be because it wasn’t 
built for hockey,” Berenson said. 
“When I first saw it — I think I 
played an exhibition game here 
with the Red Wings when I was 

with Detroit — and we played 
in here, it was like, ‘Gee, this is 
alright.’ And then it went from 
there. I came back as a coach 
and this looks like a hockey 
building right away.

“It’s become one of the iconic 

hockey buildings now. It’s not 
going to be here forever, but it’s 
been here for nearly forever.”

For many, the past 43 seasons 

of Michigan hockey at Yost have 
been tradition. For Boka, it’s 
where he and his family sat, 
year after year, watching the 
Wolverines pass pucks around 
on the ice. It’s even where he 
asked to have his birthday party 
as a kid.

Now, Boka is one of those 

guys out on the ice.

“It was always a dream of 

mine to play hockey here,” 
Boka said. “I mean, I grew up 

going to Michigan games. For 
that birthday, I got a Michigan 
penalty box that my grandpa 
built me. It’s pretty cool to look 
back on as a kid, just growing up 
and watching all those guys you 
see on the wall out there.

“(The first time I played 

hockey at Yost) was pretty 
surreal. I looked up in the stands 
where we had our old season 
tickets, and to think that I was 
once a little kid sitting there 
watching guys and thinking one 
day I would play here. I’ve got so 
many memories here as a kid. It 
was very special.”

The same goes for freshman 

forward 
Will 
Lockwood. 
A 

second 
generation 
Michigan 

hockey 
player, 
and 
third 

generation Wolverine, Lockwood 
had always been a Michigan fan.

Like Boka, Lockwood is now 

on the ice after a childhood of 
spectating. And even though 
he spent so much of his time at 
Yost watching hockey games, 
nothing compared to his own 
first game.

“It was incredible, it was 

better than I ever expected it to 
be,” Lockwood said. “I always 
knew what the environment was 
like, but actually being on the ice 
and playing in the game was on a 
whole different level. … You have 
some of the best fans in college 
hockey and one of the best rinks 
in college hockey. So putting the 
two together makes for one of 
the best environments.”

Throughout 
the 
past 

43 
seasons, 
Yost 
has 
bred 

an 
environment 
that 
is 

complementary 
to 
college 

hockey. And many have found 
their way into the National 
Hockey 
League, 
like 
Dylan 

Larkin and Luke Glendening for 
the Detroit Red Wings, or Zach 
Werenski for the Columbus Blue 
Jackets. And even more have 
found positions in the American 
Hockey League and East Coast 
Hockey League.

And they all have something 

in common — a barn in Ann 
Arbor. 

“There’s history to these old 

buildings. Minnesota had an old 
building before they built the 
new Mariucci, and it was a great 
old building, just like Yost,” 
Berenson said. “Wisconsin had 
an old building they used to play 
in, the Dane County Colosseum. 
These were buildings that were 
known all over the college 
hockey community. It could be 
traditional buildings, and that’s 
what Yost is, it’s a traditional 
building. It’s not one of the 
new, nicest and glitziest rinks 
like North Dakota is, or some of 
those other new rinks that are 
really nice.

“But this has an atmosphere, 

this has a feeling in it that’s 
special, and you can’t replace it 
with a new building.”

Wolverines return home to battle Northwestern

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico is one game away from 
reaching 100 wins at Crisler 
Center, and the 
only 
obstacle 

between 
her 

and 
second 

place 
on 
the 

all-time 
list 

for 
coaches 

in 
program 

history 
is 

Northwestern. 

The 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
(5-2 

Big 
Ten, 

16-5 overall) will be hosting 
the Wildcats (4-2, 15-4) on 
Wednesday. 
The 
Wolverines 

are 
ranked 
third 
in 
the 

conference, but Northwestern 
isn’t far behind. Both teams 
have received votes in the latest 
AP and Coaches polls in the 
past weeks.

“Northwestern is a great, 

great team led by a young lady 
named Nia Coffey,” Barnes 
Arico 
said 
in 

an 
interview 

with WTKA on 
Tuesday. 

Barnes Arico 

followed 
up 

that 
statement 

with 
a 
long 

list of Coffey’s 
achievements, 
including 
her 

prediction 
as 

a 
first-round 

WNBA 
draft 

pick, 
an 
All-

American candidate and a first-
team unanimous all-conference 
pick. Barnes Arico was also 
sure to point out that she can 
typically average a double-
double. 

“They are an experienced 

group of seniors,” Barnes Arico 
said. “They start four kids that 
have been playing together 

for four years, so they really 
have a ton of experience. They 
really play exceptionally well 
together, they know each other 
inside and out. They’re going to 
be a tough matchup.” 

The Wildcats lead the all-

time series, 38-31, and the 
all-time series in Ann Arbor, 
16-14. Their most recent win 
was Feb. 14, 2015 in a 63-62 
battle. 
The 
game 
featured 

double-digit 
scoring 
efforts 

from then-freshman Katelynn 
Flaherty and then-sophomore 
Siera Thompson with 10 and 15 
points, respectively. 

It was Northwestern’s Coffey 

who made the final layup of 
the day to push the Wildcats to 
their first lead of the day, and 
clinched the game for her team. 

“We’ve 
had 
some 
great 

games with them the last few 
years,” Barnes Arico said. “I 
would expect tomorrow to be a 
great contest.”

Yet, the advantage for this 

game might go to Michigan, 
considering the team is 10-0 
at Crisler Center this season — 
and 3-0 against Big Ten foes. 

The Wolverines have made a 

habit of taking advantage of the 

third 
quarter 

while at home, 
outscoring 
opponents, 248-
128, in the first 
ten 
minutes 

after the half.

The 

Wolverines 
will be midway 
through 
conference play 
by the end of this 
week, 
making 

it just the third 

time in school history where 
Michigan has won 16 of its first 
21 games. The last two times 
have been in the 2011-2012 and 
the 2012-2013 seasons — Barnes 
Arico’s first year at the helm of 
the program was the latter. 

Notably, in both of those 

seasons, the Wolverines went 
on to an appearance in the 

NCAA Tournament. 

The contest could hold more 

groundbreaking moments other 
than Barnes Arico’s personal 
record at Michigan. Junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty has 
a total of 1,693 career points — 
securely in third 
place 
for 
all-

time points in 
school 
history. 

But, she is just 
21 points away 
from 
bumping 

Jennifer Smith, 
who 
played 

from 
2000-

2004, out from 
second. Flaherty 
is 
leading 
the 

Wolverines 
in 

scoring, averaging 20 points 
per game. 

Additionally, senior guard 

Siera Thompson is just three 
assists away from Jenny Ryan 

(2009-2013) for second place 
in 
all-time 
assists 
for 
the 

Wolverines. Thompson is also 
en route to breaking into the 
top-10 career scoring list. With 
just 38 points to go — and half 
of the conference season left 

— 
Thompson 

could easily join 
Flaherty on the 
all-time list by 
the end of the 
year.

“I think we 

feel very, very 
confident 
at 

home, we want to 
win for the fans 
and the people 
that come here,” 
Thompson 
said 

after Michigan’s last home 
game 
against 
Minnesota. 

“(Barnes Arico) always talks 
about protecting home court 
and the block ‘M’ so I think 

we take pride in that every 
day when we play in front of 
everyone at Crisler.” 

Added Barnes Arico: “The 

first thing on that board is to 
protect that block ‘M.’ That’s 
our responsibility.” 

Northwestern 

is 
coming 
off 

a 
two-game 

winning streak 
and ranks 13th 
in the country 
— and first in 
the Big Ten — 
in 
blocks 
per 

game (6.0). In 
the 
Wildcats’ 

previous 
matchup against 
Michigan State, 
Northwestern 
guard Amber Jamison tallied a 
game-high 22 points. Jamison 
was 8-of-12 from the field and 
5-of-6 from behind the arc. 

The 
true 
test 
for 
the 

Wolverines will be to prevent 
the Wildcats from reaching 
70, or more, points because 
Northwestern has a 10-1 record 
when reaching that threshold. 
Concurrently, 
the 
Wildcats 

are 14-1 when 
holding 
their 

opposition to 69 
or fewer points. 
Northwestern 
might 
be 
in 

trouble, though, 
as 
Michigan 

averages 
83.7 

points per game 
on 48.5-percent 
shooting 
at 

Crisler Center.

“I’m 
happy 

that we’re back 

at home,” Barnes Arico said. “It 
will give us an opportunity to 
play in front of our fans on our 
home court.”

Senior guard Siera Thompson is also poised to move up in the Michigan record books, as she is just three assists away from second place on the all-time list.

As of right now, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team is on the 
outside looking in to the NCAA 
Tournament.

According to bracketmatrix.

com — a database that compiles 
bracket projections from across 
the Internet — the Wolverines 
were among the first four teams 
left out of the tournament before 
Tuesday night’s games.

But in the coming weeks, 

Michigan will have plenty of 
opportunities to face quality 
opponents and prove that it 
belongs in the field of 68.

With 
that 
in 
mind, 
the 

Daily breaks down what the 
Wolverines 
have 
done 
and 

what they will have to do in 
order to improve their NCAA 
Tournament résumé by the time 
Selection Sunday rolls around:

What 
does 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament 
Selection 

Committee look at?

The 
10-member 
NCAA 

selection committee uses its 
judgment (“eye test”) along 
with several key metrics to 
evaluate a team’s performance. 
According 
to 
NCAA.com, 

some of those metrics include: 
Ratings 
Percentage 
Index 

(RPI); strength of schedule; 
performance 
against 
top-50 

teams; home and road records; 
various 
computer 
metrics 

such as Ken Pomeroy and Jeff 
Sagarin; head-to-head results; 
and results versus common 
opponents.

Michigan’s Key Numbers 

(as of Jan. 24)

Overall Record: 13-7

Conference Record: 3-4

RPI: 69

Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 43

Jeff Sagarin Rating: 38

Strength 
of 
Schedule 

(according to Ken Pomeroy): 54

Record vs. RPI Top 25: 0-4

Record vs. RPI Top 50: 2-6

Record vs. RPI Top 100: 5-6

Record vs. NCAA tournament 

teams 
(using 
bracketmatrix.

com): 3-5

Home/Neutral Record: 13-2

Road Record: 0-5

Michigan’s current résumé

The first factor that jumps 

out from Michigan’s résumé is 
its lack of wins against NCAA 
Tournament-caliber teams. The 
Wolverines have yet to record a 
win over RPI top-25 teams, and 
those struggles extend to their 
2-6 mark versus RPI top-50 
opposition. Michigan needs to 
show the selection committee it 
can be competitive with teams 
expected to make the field of 68 
and, so far, the Wolverines’ only 
convincing evidence are their two 
wins against Southern Methodist 
and Marquette in New York.

Here’s the good news for 

Michigan: 
The 
Wolverines 

have yet to suffer a bad loss. 
Michigan’s worst loss was at 
Iowa — No. 113 in the RPI — 
with the rest of the Wolverines’ 
defeats coming to teams within 
the RPI’s top-50. Rutgers is 
the only remaining team on 
Michigan’s schedule with an 
RPI over 100. As long as the 
Wolverines 
don’t 
drop 
that 

game, they’ll steer clear of any 
ugly blemishes on their résumé.

Michigan also scores well in 

the computer rankings that the 
selection committee will begin 
to factor in this year. Those high 
marks primarily hang on the 
Wolverines’ strength of schedule 
and wins over the Mustangs and 
Golden Eagles in New York. 
Michigan will have chances to 
boost its ratings in the coming 

weeks, and the computers seem 
to have a favorable view of the 
Wolverines, which will come in 
handy in March.

How can Michigan’s résumé 

improve?

To put it simply: By winning 

the 
big 
games 
left 
on 
its 

schedule.

The Wolverines will have 

plenty of chances to pick up 
some impressive wins in the 
next 
few 
weeks. 
Michigan 

plays Indiana and Michigan 
State twice each in its next five 
games. Both the Spartans and 
the Hoosiers have gotten off to 
sluggish starts in the Big Ten, 
but are still projected to make 
the 
tournament 
field. 
Over 

this stretch, the Wolverines 
can potentially reshape their 
record against top-50 teams — 
an important criteria for the 
selection committee.

Michigan 
also 
needs 
to 

improve its road record. The 
Wolverines are currently 0-5 in 
true road games, and they will 
have plenty of chances coming 
up to post some away wins on 
the board. Michigan’s next three 
road games are against Michigan 
State, Indiana and Northwestern. 
Because the Wolverines dropped 
winnable away contests at Iowa 
and at Illinois, they’ll need 
to win a couple of these more 
challenging road games to make 
up for those early losses.

There are some metrics that 

Michigan can’t control that can 
end up helping it come Selection 
Sunday. 
The 
Wolverines’ 

strength of schedule can continue 
to improve if Michigan’s non-
conference opponents maintain 
their winning ways. Southern 
Methodist, 
South 
Carolina 

and UCLA all currently rank 
in the top-3 of their respective 
conference standings. Marquette 
pulled off an upset victory over 
Creighton over the weekend, and 
Virginia Tech defeated Duke a 
few weeks ago.

One team to keep an eye 

on 
out 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

non-conference opposition is 
Marquette. Just like Michigan, 
the Golden Eagles are a bubble 
team, currently projected to 
barely make the field of 68. If 
both teams continue down that 
path, and only one spot remains 
in the tournament field, how 
much will the committee value 
the Wolverines’ November win 
over Marquette? In the best case 
scenario, Michigan hopes its 
play on the court will improve to 
a point where it won’t have this 
question hanging over its head 
on Selection Sunday.

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Michigan coach John Beilein will need the Wolverines to win the big games left on their schedule in order to give themselves a better shot on Selection Sunday. 

The Wolverines still have work to do to earn a spot in the field of 68

MICHIGAN IN COLOR
an inclusive space by and for people of color

in collaboration with


T

his past Saturday, I stood in the 
campus Diag and saw countless 
signs for the Women’s March 

in Ann Arbor. Some of them were witty 
and creative, others were more direct 
and serious. But there was one sign in 
particular that stood out. Reading it 
made me re-evaluate how I see myself 
as a woman. The sign, simply put in 
black and white, read: Treat yourself 
the way you would treat your daughter. 
I had to go over this message in my mind 
because, no, I don’t have a daughter, and 
I couldn’t wrap my mind around the 
meaning.

Most signs were direct messages 

or questions, many revolving around 
women’s empowerment, LGBTQ rights, 
racism and President Donald Trump’s 
misogyny. So, it was odd to see a sign 
that provoked so many questions and 
made me reflect on how I respect 
myself. I felt like it made an assumption 
that I do not treat myself with the 
respect I would and should give to my 
hypothetical daughter.

At first I was confused and somewhat 

insulted, but after much consideration, 
this message rightfully began to make 
sense.

Far too often, there are times when 

I verbally beat myself up. Whether it 
be my body, my actions, my regrets 
or my relationships, I am consistently 
blaming myself for not believing in 
my full potential. And, no, this is 
not how all women treat themselves, 
but unfortunately I’ve noticed that 
I and the women around me share 
this notion (the Women’s March and 
movement is changing this norm — 
thank god).

So I actually asked myself: “How 

would I treat my daughter?”

Clearly, I would treat her with 

unconditional love: tell her she is 
beautiful the way she is, to never let 
anyone bully her, to fight for what she 
believes in, to wear what she wants, to 
say what she wants — the list would go 
on.

I immediately thought of my past, 

the regrets and painful moments 
scattered in my mind like a swarm of 
bees. Memories of being bullied, of all 
the apologies I should not have been 
sorry for, of all the times I gave up, of 
all the times I devoted so much to guys 
who treated me like shit, of all the times 
I cried because I didn’t like the way I 
looked, and, most painfully, the time I 
was sexually assaulted.

My assault happened my first term 

freshman year. Looking back, it feels 
so fast, so odd and so fuzzy — I did 
everything to block it out of my head. 
Anyone who has been assaulted might 
still feel those hands unbuttoning their 
jeans, can still smell the breath of the 
attacker, can still feel the surface they 
were being pushed up against, can 
hear the sound of pushing the attacker, 
the monster, off of them. It breaks my 
heart to know that that is not always 
the case.

The most mentally grotesque part 

of my story could be that, for an hour 
after, I thought it might actually have 
been my fault. If that were my daughter, 

I wouldn’t even let her finish that 
sentence.

I would hold her tight and tell her, 

“don’t you ever think that way.” I would 
tell her this is not OK and it will never 
be OK. I would tell her to report this and 
to have her voice be heard in marches, 
like the one this weekend — standing in 
front of a sea of people who understand 
what she has been through.

I would teach her and all my children 

that being a woman, in any and all 
aspects, is not something to beat 
yourself up about. It is not something to 
apologize for. Being a woman does not 
mean being inferior.

After sharing my story with friends, 

they, too, shared stories similar to my 
own. The fact that I can find this much 
common ground within my community 
of friends surprises me. This is what 
boils my blood.

And then the sign comes back into 

focus. I don’t want to just tell my friends 
“I’m so sorry” and “I understand.” I 
want to tell them, “Treat yourself the 
way you would treat your daughter.” I 
want them to take care of themselves 
the way they would take care of their 
daughters. And yes, maybe it’s not 
that simple in some cases, but maybe 
this is an opportunity to change our 
perspective on how we see ourselves as 
women.

If I could see that woman who held 

that sign again, I would thank her 
for opening my mind to a new kind 
of confidence and self-care. The next 
time I judge my body, apologize for 
something unnecessary or doubt my 
potential, I will remind myself of those 
nine simple, but groundbreaking words. 
Treat yourself the way you would treat 
your daughter.

I

’ve been to two therapists in my 
life. The story behind the first 
guy isn’t that interesting. I was 

a nervous 11-year-old; like, a really 
nervous 11-year-old, and I was lucky 
enough to go to a therapist and even 
luckier to have therapy who actually 
helped.

My second therapist is a more 

interesting story. I found her by 
Googling “Ann Arbor Hypnotherapy” 
and choosing between the two options 
that came up. The deciding factors 
were some combination of the two 
websites’ aesthetic, their testimonials 
and the ease with which I could locate 
their email addresses. For some reason, 
technological wherewithal was a quality 
I valued in a hypnotherapist.

It was toward the end of my 

sophomore year of college. The anxiety I 
had worked so hard in my youth to keep 
at bay was creeping back into my life, in 
part because I had actual worry-worthy 
things to worry about. It was the type of 
nervous cocktail that created thoughts 
like “If I don’t get this internship, I’m 
going to contract a fatal respiratory 
infection and die.”

I don’t exactly know why I pursued 

hypnotherapy instead of other, more 

mainstream types of therapy. I know a 
guy who tried hypnotherapy and said 
it worked, and as a kid was obsessed 
with “Molly Moon’s Incredible Book of 
Hypnotism,” but other than that, I have 
no affiliation with hypnosis. Weird flex 
by me, but whatever.

I emailed my prospective therapist, 

the one with the better website. I 
will call her Molly for nostalgia and 
anonymity. She responded quickly and 
we set up a time to chat.

During our first meeting, she showed 

me her gold pocket watch, a family 
heirloom that had been passed down 
through generations and embedded 
with magical hypnotic powers. She told 
me to sit back in the chair, relax and 
follow the watch with my eyes. What 
felt like two minutes later, I woke up, 
with almost no recollection of the event. 

I’m kidding — there was no pocket 

watch, or magic, or loss of memory. 
Though I would be lying if, prior to my 
first meeting, some percentage of me 
legitimately thought something like 
that would happen.

It didn’t. At our first meeting Molly 

probably asked me 50 questions about 
my life, taking detailed notes and 
giving some feedback on my responses. 

The most notable piece of advice from 
this session was that if I drank more 
water, that would solve all my anxiety 
issues. I chuckled when she said this, 
before quickly realizing she wasn’t 
joking.

In truth, hypnosis only describes 

a fraction of what Molly does. She 
really is an oracle of all things related 
to spiritual and alternative healing. 
In addition to hydration tips, Molly’s 
repertoire 
of 
healing 
practices 

includes teaching me a set of yoga 
breathing 
techniques, 
facilitating 

guided meditations tailored to my 
specific anxieties, and assigning me 
homework assignments like “spend 
three hours this week doing something 
that exclusively benefits other people.”

Shoes 
are 
forbidden 
in 
her 

cramped office, so we’d make casual 
conversation as I removed my boots 
and placed them outside her door 
before entering. I’d sit on a tan 
reclining chair with a partially broken 
lever and she’d tell me about Chi, and 
natural energy, and traditions that pre-
date any ibuprofen by an uncountable 
number of lifetimes.

For most of my life, I was a staunch 

skeptic of all things related to the 
spiritual and alternative. That is, 
I would guess, pretty normal for 
being an American-born 21-year-old. 
Western medicine is built on the trust 
in empiricism and some alternative 
healing practices simply don’t have 
the data to back up their performance, 
or don’t have the data that the Western 
world trusts. It also might just be 
Western arrogance, it really might just 
be Western arrogance.

In any case, I was happy to 

indulge Molly’s conversations about 
Chi and natural energy flow, but 
I always thought of them as more 
interesting mental exercises, rather 
than anything actually altering an 
iota of my body. I’d think of them in 
terms of more mainstream mental 
health 
practices, 
reflecting 
my 

learned American exceptionalism. 
I’d commend Molly’s practices on 
reaching the same conclusion as 
the clearly more “correct” Western 
medicine therapies.

When she first brought up “tapping,” 

the skepticism remained. Tapping, 
or emotional freedom therapy, is a 
style of healing that involves tapping 

on certain points of the body that are 
believed to stimulate one’s life energy, 
or Chi. Molly told me that anxiety and 
depression can be caused by a stoppage 
of energy flow. She said there are more 
than 100 spots that could be touched 
on the body to stimulate the flow of 
energy; she gave me 11 of these spots 
to start with.

Even a year later I remember her 

final words on the technique: “The 
best part is, you don’t need to believe 
it’s working for it to work.”

So, in the tan chair with the broken 

lever, I hesitantly began tapping. She 
adjusted my form, because apparently 
I was missing the imaginary spot on 
my body that was going to stimulate 
the imaginary life energy going 
through my body.

I tapped and thought about what 

was overwhelming me. I thought 
about how certain I was about all the 
terrible stuff coming my way, and how 
uncertain I was about what my survival 
plan was. Then, rather quickly, some 
of those worries began to slip away. 
The muscles in my neck unclenched 
and the wave of impending things to 
do and things done wrong started to 
seem farther and farther away from 
me.

I let out something like a gasp when I 

was done, embarrassed at how pleased 
I must have looked, and how clearly 
not sold I was prior to the exercise.

“See?” she said, giving me a smile 

that was equal parts I-told-ya-so and 
glad-I-could-help.

To this day, I still tap. I tapped last 

week when I heard norovirus was 
back. I tapped on Jan. 20, for some 
reason. I tap before plane rides, tests 
and hard conversations.

Molly and her tapping therapeutic 

powers helped me in two ways. The 
first being the obvious one: giving me 
this new tool to combat anxiety. The 
second gift was a lesson in humility. 
When I tap, it reminds me of how little 
I know about how my body works. 
It reminds me that maybe there is 
Chi in my body that gets clogged up 
sometimes, or maybe some of the 
“certainties” in my life are things I’m 
not so certain about at all.

I often get caught up in anxiety 

about what my future holds. Tapping 
is a much-needed reminder that more 
often than not, I don’t actually know.

COMMENTARY 

FROM CAMPUS 

ACTIVISTS

Editor’s Note: Following the inaugura-

tion of President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, 
editors of Michigan in Color — a section by 
and for people of color, dedicated to pub-
lishing inclusive and intersectional content 
about race — interviewed and reflected on 
the commentary of eight student social jus-
tice leaders in the article below.
T

he 2016 presidential election 
has dominated this past year’s 
news cycle. This year, we said 

farewell to the first Black president of 
the United States and inaugurated a man 
who has reflected the cultural divides of 
a nation roiled by social and economic 
transformation. He narrowly flipped 
states that Obama had won twice while 
articulating support for a ban on Muslim 
immigration and hinting at a discrimi-
natory Muslim identification registry. 
He wants to build a wall separating 
the United States from Mexico, and he 
ignorantly painted all Black communi-
ties as crime-ridden, uneducated and 
unemployed. The division has not been 
without reaction — the day following 
Trump’s inauguration, millions in cities 
across the country participated in the 
Women’s March for civil rights.

Many of us who identify as people 

of color have experienced an attack on 
our racial identities over these past few 
months. As a voice for students of color 
on campus, we the editors of Michigan in 
Color set out to discover how marginal-
ized students are feeling about the state 
of our campus and country in the open-
ing days of Trump’s presidency. Instead 
of asking for their political views or 
opinions on specific policies, we aimed 
to focus on how they plan to turn their 
feelings into action.

In the face of heightened racial anxi-

eties, we found that students of color 
on our campus share both concern and 
a desire to impact change following the 
election of President Donald Trump. 
Though students from across the Uni-
versity of Michigan bring diverse per-
spectives to our campus, one thing is 

clear: We are stronger as one and, as one, 
we must take action.

Now more than ever we cannot let 

the political climate fill us with hate 
or divide us further. The saying “love 
trumps hate” is more than a politi-
cal slogan — it is a fact. Love connects 
where hate divides. By giving a voice to 
student leaders of color, we aim to rally 
the student body in celebration of our 
differences. We also want to shed light 
on the highly personal nature of protest 
— the ways one person expresses their 
right to assembly is not the way another 
activist fighting for the same cause does. 
Through these leaders’ voices, we hope 
to reveal the work that has been done and 
the work that’s still left to do to address 
inequality on campus and beyond. Most 
importantly, however, we aim to reveal 
some of the people behind it..

Before the election, I was extremely 

confident in (Hillary Clinton). Not only 
because of her amazing aptitude — I 
genuinely believe that she was the most 
qualified candidate to run for any office 
— but also because I figured my fellow 
countrymen and women would reject 
the hate spewed by Donald Trump. As 
we all know, I was wrong. On Novem-
ber 8th, Americans voted to “take back 
their country” — a move I presume was 
racially motivated. After eight years of 
a Black president, Americans rejected 
this progress by electing a racist chau-
vinist.

Looking back, I regret not doing more 

to stop Trump’s ascension to the Oval 
Office. If more people knew about the 
damaging effects that Trump’s policies 
would wreak on everyday Americans, 
instead of the “alternative facts” spewed 
from his campaign, maybe people would 
have thought twice before casting their 

vote. For progress to be made in the 
future, it’s essential for Democrats to not 
alienate working-class people. Instead, a 
message should be crafted that focuses 
on uniting all people — including people 
of color and other marginalized back-
grounds — under the promise of a better, 
more equitable future.

Additionally, I am incredibly wary 

about Trump’s cabinet picks. His choice 
for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is a 
known racist. I do not believe he’ll rep-
resent my interests as an African Ameri-
can, and I certainly don’t feel that he 
will fight to protect the tens of millions 
of Americans of marginalized identities. 
Likewise, I fear for female Americans 
who now live under a commander in 
chief who’s openly admitted to sexually 
assaulting women.

For now, I protest because I have 

to. But I personally don’t think that 
unprivileged people should be on the 
frontlines begging to be treated equally. 
In an ideal world, people with privilege 
would speak up for those without, using 
their power for good. As it stands now, 
that isn’t the case. I’m forced to fight 
to be recognized as an equal human 
being, and I will continue fighting for 
my rights and the rights of others until 
it’s no longer necessary.

Recently, this white boy just came real 

close to me and got in my face about my 
Black Lives Matter shirt. I get weird looks 
every time I wear that shirt. Either people 
will give me dirty looks or just not talk to 
me.

I still wear my Black Lives Matter shirt 

and have my sticker on my laptop. The 
looks I recieve when I do are a result of 
the media portraying the movement so 
poorly. Supporters are ignorantly looked 
at as people who hate other races, but I 

want people to understand that I am a per-
son — I will be your friend. And I think that 
today’s climate with the Women’s March has 
been amazing and needed. I don’t think it 
was too late, but I definitely feel these things 
should happen sooner and more often. I’m 
very worried about undoing so quickly what 
we have worked so hard to do. I want people, 
no matter what color, to not be selfish.

I go to marches when I can. If something 

is happening, I’ll go support.

People need to vote. The presidential elec-

tion is not the only election that exists. There 
are hundreds of other people in the House 
and Senate who also have a say. It’s scary that 
this orange, racist man is the new president.

To put it bluntly, I do not feel safe in 

Trump’s America; nor do I think anything 
positive will happen over the next four 
years. In fact, I think the next four years 
will be very rough for many Americans. By 
the end, we’ll need to work hard to repair 
the damage left in his wake. But somehow 
more concerning to me is the potential for 
damage committed by Trump’s supporters. 
And with him as president, I don’t foresee 
any dip in the number of hate crimes we’ve 
seen against marginalized groups since 
Trump announced his candidacy. This 
constant state of fear, for myself as well 
as my fellow Americans, is, quite frankly, 
exhausting.

Perhaps the only silver lining I can draw 

from Trump’s presidency is that his goal to 
divide people ended up uniting us. While 
Trump’s victory may have been because 
he pitted people against one another, the 
women’s marches last weekend showed 
the world that we are united as one against 
hate and bigotry.

Still, there is much more progress to be 

made when it comes to coalition building. 
While marching is a great way to exercise 
political opinions, it’s crucial that future 
movements don’t forget intersectionality. 
Someone who marches for women’s rights 
should also find themselves marching on 
the streets for #BlackLivesMatter and 
LGBTQ+ rights, to name a few.

Moving forward, it’s essential we make 

more of an effort to communicate with 
others. I truly believe that if more Trump 
supporters had ever met and had a conver-
sation with a Muslim, a Latinx, an African 
American or an immigrant, Donald Trump 
would not be in the Oval Office today. It’s 
easy to vote against a group you’ve never 
met; it’s much harder to vote against a fel-
low human. Even on our “diverse” campus, 
students should still make an effort to reach 
out to those different than themselves. When 

this occurs, we will start ridding ourselves 
of the misconceptions that fueled the rise of 
Donald Trump.

Many minority groups on campus are 

understandably concerned about where they 
stand over the next four years. Will their 
rights be taken from them? What’s going to 
happen? Trump has said a lot of scary things, 
and people are worried about the future.

I see a lot of parallels between the recent 

Women’s March and the civil rights move-
ment. While people think about Martin 
Luther King Jr. when they think civil rights, 
the march on Selma was organized by Stu-
dent Nonviolent Coordinating Committee — 
a group of people just like us. Many people 
from different backgrounds united under 
one voice to try to persuade a privileged 
group to give them full equality. People need 
to put aside differences and come together 
to create that collective voice in the struggle 
for equal rights because not one group can do 
all of this. Coalition building is necessary for 
success.

For people of color to be effective, I think 

it is a two-pronged attack. We need to not 
only improve our situations on an individu-
al level, but also on a societal level. We often 
feel that our impact is small, but I think it is 
important for us to keep these topics in our 
conversations with our friends and family 
— the people we can really affect. We have 
to continue to take a stand with non-violent 
protests. If we can truly show our pain and 
suffering to another, that’s how the percep-
tion of people of color will truly change.

I am not worried about a facetious rule. 

A lot of the president’s statements are 
unbacked. I think they were superficially 
said and used to gain votes. I truly believe 
and hope his statements won’t come true. 
I worry about the increased power of big 
business because America’s greatest weak-
ness comes when those of power gain more 
control.

It’s important for us to remember what 

America stands for because at the core we 
cannot change America, though society 

will continue to change. For me, Obama’s 
greatest impact he’s had is instilling hope 
and that is something we cannot forget.

I did not let my frustrations with the 

results of the election stop me from taking 
advantage of the opportunities I have as a 
student of the University of Michigan. Had 
I done so, I would not have been accepted 
as a participant for MHIRT, the Minor-
ity Health and Health Disparities Interna-
tional Research Training program. Over 
the course of this summer, I will travel to 
Ghana to fight the health disparities I am 
so passionate about.

Whatever feelings you have as a person 

of color are valid, and you have the right to 
express them in the ways you feel are best. 
However, you should not let these feelings 
inhibit you in any way; rather, let them fuel 
you. The election is over and it is time to 
think of the best ways to move forward. I 
am worried that the president is not going 
to listen to some of the issues people of 
color face when they should listen to all of 
those who are affected by their policies.

I will continue to tackle health dispari-

ties and medical racism with all that I am 
and in all I do. Along the way, there may be 
setbacks, but I will still push forward with 
the passion and drive to accomplish my goals.

For students of color, you know that the 

way other students of color are treated indi-
rectly affects you. As an Asian-American 
male, the racial oppression we have faced 
hasn’t been as highlighted as other groups, 
but that doesn’t mean we can’t stand in 
solidarity with them. By supporting other 
students of color, I know I can contribute to 
the fight for equal justice, which improves 
racial conditions for groups even if their 
struggles aren’t as well-known. Knowing 
that can be powerful, impactful and can go 
a long way.

From taking Intergroup Relations last 

semester to being more invested as a stu-
dent of color on campus, I feel that I can 
speak more openly and freely to other non-
students of color surrounding racial issues 

on campus. For non-students of color, their 
voices have the most resources and most 
power to bring about change, especially in 
the political process. It’s important for them 
to realize that there are policies and systems 
put in place that unjustly and unfairly lessen 
groups of people, and they need to realize 
that non-students of color have the power to 
do something and ultimately help provide a 
more positive and just society.

People of color have different needs; dif-

ferent marginalized communities will have 
different needs and different fears. A lot 
of our activism has to be productive in a 
defensive way. We are a lot less free to make 
activist choices — which more privileged 
identities can make in terms of protesting. 
I’ve skipped out on a few protests because I 
am a brown trans-woman. If I am arrested 
and end up in a male prison cell, that would 
do bad things for my mental health and 
for my ability to keep going and doing this 
work.

I also have to worry about whether 

action will be inclusive of all my identities, 
which it’s usually not. I have to do what I 
can, which is participating in more educa-
tion-oriented work and in safer spaces. At 
first I was a little down on myself for that, 
but I realized I’m still doing positive work. 
I’m still making a difference.

The first thing people of color need to 

do is selfishly take care of our own needs. 
In the upcoming months, we will lose a 
lot of resources and things important to 
us. We need to do our best to exist. A big 
thing I try and tell marginalized people is 
existence is a form of resistance. Much of 
the greater world at large, whether they’ll 
admit it or not, wants our existence to be 
limited to certain modes of being in specif-
ic places where they can choose to avoid.

Beyond taking care of ourselves, people 

of color need to find ways to educate white 
people. It sucks because that’s not our 
responsibility and not an expectation I 
have for people of color, but also one of the 
only ways they will learn is by education 
from us. White people need to be educated 
on our needs, our fears, the things we need 
them to be doing for us.

ometimes my mind takes me back 
to that one day in early September 
of freshman year, when I visited 

the University of Michigan Museum of Art 
with a group of strangers; students from 
my hall, from orientation, people I thought 
would become my best friends. In reality, 
they just became even more distant. How 
cultured and sophisticated, I thought to 
myself back then.

When I started college, I pictured 

constantly expanding my horizons — 
traveling to different places and trying 
new things. I was excited to explore more 
of Ann Arbor’s culture and be the kind 
of artsy person I saw on my Instagram 
newsfeed, with pictures of graffiti alleys 
and hidden fairy doors. This seemed like 
what college would really be about.

I imagined the group of us moving 

through the museum in a sepia-toned 
haze, talking about Neo-Impressionism 
or tempera paint, armed with cups of 
overpriced coffee from down the street 
because we were too good for Starbucks.

For me, that day was disastrous.
Despite 
having 
religiously 
pored 

over a glossary of art terms the night 
before (thanks, Google), I found myself 
hopelessly inept. Standing in front of an 
incredibly detailed painting twice my 
size that must have taken months, if not 
years to complete, I felt small. Who was 
I to critique someone else’s work? What 

business did I have tossing around terms 
like sublime or naturalistic when I didn’t 
understand anything about art?

It slowly dawned on me that I’d probably 

never had an eye for art in the first place. 
I’d look at a piece and think it looked 
pretty neat, while the person next to me 
would talk about the motivation behind it 
and how the artful brushstrokes created 
an illusion of depth. As we moved through 
the next few rooms, I found myself falling 
back a little more each time, eventually 
making a swift exit, while the rest of the 
group was busy laughing and talking, 
bonding over a particularly interesting 
photograph.

You see, I’ve never described myself as a 

visual art person.

A writer? Sure.
A musician? I can work with that.
But when I see a blank canvas and rows 

of paint, I’ve never felt the urge to create. 
I’m not immediately struck by a vision, 
and I don’t know how to take an idea and 
visualize it in a way that is comprehensive 
and beautiful. At best, I can scrawl out 
a vague stick-figure-esque drawing or 
maybe paint one of those generic-looking 
landscapes. Maybe.

I’d watch my friends in high school 

effortlessly create gorgeous pieces of art 
and wonder in envy at how their brushes 
seem to glide smoother than mine, how 
they just intuitively knew where to place 

the next stroke of paint. I spent years 
wishing I had that skill — taking art classes 
in high school and practicing whenever I 
had time and a pencil — but it was never 
instinctive for me.

Which is why I never thought that I’d 

end up in an art class my sophomore year 
of college. Through a unique combination 
of requirements and the program I was in, 
I found myself taking LHSP 230, Creative 
Communities, a class focused on public art 
and creative expression. It was a terrifying 
prospect to me: Art was something I’d 
been trying (and failing) to do for a long 
time, and now I’d be in a space entirely 
focused on it.

And I wasn’t entirely sure how I felt 

about that. Living in a learning community 
focused on writing and the arts, I had 
friends who were incredibly artistic and 
seen what they’d created in these classes. 
The work they made was amazing, and I 
was nervous because I wasn’t sure what 
exactly was expected of me. I knew, 
without a doubt, that I wouldn’t be able 
to make anything even remotely as good, 
but I’d resolved myself to trying as hard 
as I could. Even then, I felt pressured to 
achieve perfection.

Our first assignment had us creating 

“luminaries,” 
which 
were 
three-

dimensional structures made out of wire, 
paper-maché and lights. I’d gone into this 
assuming we’d start out with something 

small, but our professor had larger plans 
for us — specifically, to be a part of a pop-
up parade at ArtPrize in Grand Rapids. 
So not only was I forced to face my fears 
much sooner than anticipated, there’d 
be an audience of people who actually 
appreciated art watching my every move.

There were moments where I’d find 

myself in Alice Lloyd Hall’s art studio, 
huddled under a workbench, the overhead 
lights occasionally blinking off as if 
mocking my catatonic state. As I looked at 
the tangled mess of wire and tape that was 
supposed to be my project, and compared 
it to the perfect ones all around me, I was 
frustrated and confused. Those first few 
weeks were hard — nothing made me feel 
more incompetent than not being able to 
create something with the apparent ease 
that everyone else in the class possessed.

I think it was one of those 2 a.m. 

moments when I had nothing to show 
but the battle scars left by metal splinters 
(wire is harder to work with than you’d 
think) that I finally realized — I was the 
only one that cared this much. While 
everyone else was having fun and creating 
things, I was stuck inside my own head, 
too infatuated with rigid definitions of 
“art” and “artist” to do anything at all. I’d 
spent years building the entire concept of 
art up in my head as if it were some sort 
of mysterious and elusive force that I’d 
never be able to understand, something 

that was unattainable. I’ve constantly 
been telling myself that I can’t create 
art, when it can be interpreted in so 
many different ways, and constructed 
with a variety of mediums — there is no 
singular definition.

Art doesn’t have to be understood, just 

to be appreciated. It’s hard to convince 
myself that after years of thinking the 
exact opposite, but I’m allowed to have 
my own definition of art — and I’m 
allowed to create things, whether or not 
other people think they’re good. When 
it comes to things that are so subjective, 
I’ve learned that over-analyzing every 
single move only held me back.

I still don’t know much about neo-

impressionism 
except 
that 
“Starry 

Night” is pretty cool, and I’m vaguely 
sure that tempera is some sort of egg 
paint. On some days I’ll go to the UMMA 
and sit in front of my favorite painting, 
“Broadway Melody.” I appreciate the 
subtle blues and pinks and the intricate 
patterns, and how it invokes thoughts 
of jazz and happiness. On those days, I 
don’t wonder what neo-impressionism 
means, or what tempera is made of — I 
just focus on being in the moment.

Personal Statement: I’m Not an Art Person

eather

It is strange to visit a place full of dead 

bodies that have decomposed, or are in the 

process of decomposing, and think about your loved ones 
in this way — no longer breathing the fresh air above the 
ground they now lie beneath.

When I kneel down in front of her, my eyes fill with 

thunderstorms and my body shakes like a hurricane. 
My mind is spinning like a tornado, but the world that 
surrounds me would appear cheerful to any other per-
son; the sun bright and beating down on the green grass 
below, complimented by the blue sky that is so clear — it 
almost seems ironic.

The Kiss
Her favorite painting was Gustav Klimt’s The Kiss.
A few days after her funeral, my mom and I went to 

her house to start going through her things. We didn’t 
know how to start; when we walked into her bedroom, 
her closet, her office, it was as though she had just left it 
for a few minutes and was going to be back any second.

We touched her clothes, clothes she had just worn the 

week before, clothes she had just bought the week before 
with intentions of wearing. We touched her makeup, her 
millions of shades of lipstick, so numerous that, if she 
were there, we would have made fun of her for owning 
three of the exact same color.

When we walked into her office I saw a planner for 

2014 on the front of her desk with a picture of The Kiss 
on the cover. I opened it up to find it blank, which wasn’t 
a surprise considering she passed during the first week 
of January.

It broke my heart to see that she had bought a planner 

for the new year because it made the fact that she had 
had no idea she was going to die so clear, and I thought 
about how she should have had this year and next year 
and the year after that to fill out her days in a little book 
that had her favorite piece of art on it.

Mom
I have always been close with my mom. She is my 

best friend, my rock, my heart. With a street education 
straight out of Queens, N.Y., and a formal education from 
Cornell University, she’s the strongest, toughest and 
smartest woman I know.

When Grandma died, it was the first time in my life 

I saw her weak. I had never heard her cry so hard and I 
had never seen her emptier than when we were in the car 
on the way to the funeral. She looked over to the driver’s 

seat where my dad was sitting and I heard her say she 
thought she was going to be sick.

When we got to the funeral home, a man who worked 

there asked us if we would like to see her body and I 
declined because I refused to have my last sight of her 
be lifeless and pale. I watched my mom follow the man, 
and over the loudspeaker that bled into the waiting room 
I could hear her scream “Mom” as she sobbed into my 
father’s shoulder.

After that day, I never took a second with her or any 

member of my family for granted because that sound 
of her screaming echoes in my mind, and that memory 
makes me sick and I realized that I really do not think my 
soul would be able to handle it if anyone else who I loved 
died. I know this is completely unreasonable, and I know 
that everybody dies, but the mere idea of losing someone 
else makes me feel crippled and shaky and paralyzed.

Birthdays
No one ever tells you how strange holidays and birth-

days will be without someone who has been at every cel-
ebration for as long as you can remember.

When my 17th birthday came — four months after 

my grandma passed away — I did not realize how much 
I would miss her presence on my birthday until I got a 
card five days late with my name on it that was sent from 
her address — but inside was a plain check for $50 sent 
from the man she was married to instead of a day spent 
making memories together like we used to do, every sin-
gle year.

Polaroids
For my 15th birthday I asked for a Polaroid camera. 

She got it for me, of course — she loved to spoil her 
grandchildren and I was no exception.

I asked my dad to do the honor of taking the first pic-

ture — a picture of me and my mom; I told him to look 
through the little viewfinder eyepiece and to be careful 
because he only had one shot at taking the picture. He 
pressed down the little button on the top and the camera 
flashed and as he handed it back to me with the small 
picture that had instantaneously printed out, I set both 
the camera and the picture down on the kitchen counter 
to wait for the picture to develop. I cannot recall where 
I went or what I was doing but 10 minutes later when I 
came back the camera was gone.

I stormed into my then 9-year-old brother’s bedroom, 

(somehow I knew he was guilty), to find him with my 
camera in his hand and I saw that he had just taken a 
picture.

I yelled at him for taking what was mine and I asked 

him if he knew how much the film cost and I asked him 
what exactly I was going to do with a picture of Grandma 
just sitting on his bed, a picture that I wasn’t even in.

I misplaced the picture of my grandma.
I wish, I wish, I wish I could have saved that picture 

because God, I remember now that my grandma really 
looked so pretty simply sitting there, flashing her gor-
geous smile, and having that tiny picture would now 
mean so much more to me than any of the other pictures 
I took with those girls who I am not even friends with 
anymore, or with the stupid boy that cheated on me, or of 
the ice cream cones from that place down the street that 
I now realize are upsettingly replaceable.

Shoes
Shoes are so personal. Someone puts their whole body, 

their whole being, their whole weight into two pieces of 
wardrobe that they take with them everywhere they go. 
Traveling, to the supermarket, shopping, exercising.

She always had the best shoes.
One of my favorite parts about myself has always been 

that I fit into her shoes. After her death, I inherited all of 
them. There must have been 50 pairs.

It is always a weird feeling when I buy a new pair of 

shoes and when I wear shoes that weren’t hers. God, I 
wish they were.

Flowers
As a little girl, I would have dance recitals that my 

mom would always invite my grandma to come see and 
when I got on stage in my little black tap shoes to per-
form my routine, my eyes would search the audience, 
until I found her and the signature bouquet of roses in 
her hands that she always brought for me.

They were the prettiest flowers.
My mom would put them in a vase next to my bed and 

they would last about a week before they began to wilt, 
until one day I would walk into my room and they would 
no longer be there.

My mom loved to clean up.
I now think about the flowers that are brought to my 

grandmother’s grave and I think about how one day it 
was her that was no longer there, and when everything 
comes rushing back I think about how comforted I felt 
when I would look out into the audience and see her face 
and her lipstick-painted smile beaming at me. I remem-
ber how she looked at me and I remember how she loved 
me and it makes everything worse and everything better
