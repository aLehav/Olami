ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Residents struggle 
with crisis’ lasting 
impacts as leaders 
seek to rebuild trust

By SAM GRINGLAS

Managing News Editor

FLINT, Mich. — On a Saturday 

evening in October, several hundred 
trick-or-treaters 
streamed 
up 

and down Calumet Street on the 
city’s east side. Traffic clogged the 
neighborhood’s streets, lined with 
well-maintained Tudors, Colonials 
and mature trees cloaked in hues 
of red and yellow. Princesses, ninja 
turtles, witches and firemen darted 
between the cars, and on their front 
lawn, Bob and Melodee Mabbitt 
passed out candy from beneath 
a rain umbrella. The Mabbitt’s 
stretch of Calumet is wealthier than 
most of Flint’s neighborhoods, and 
draws kids from all over town on 

Halloween. But this year, along with 
Snickers, Crunch bars and boxes of 
Nerds, the Mabbitts were handing 
out leaflets.

The letters were bold and black, 

and they warned Flint parents their 
kids may have been exposed to toxic 
lead from their drinking water. 
“You are getting this as a courtesy 
to let you know that one or more of 
your neighbors had their tap water 
tested and was informed they have 
very high contents of lead and 
other pollutants in their water,” the 

fliers read. Nayyirah Shariff, a Flint 
community organizer and friend 
of Melodee’s, slid the white, folded 
fliers into dozens of old pillowcases 
and plastic buckets shaped like jack-
o’-lanterns. “Don’t worry, there’s 
candy, too,” she assured a group 
of kids clad in raincoats. “Happy 
Halloween!”

In October, Michigan Gov. Rick 

Snyder (R) announced the city of 
Flint’s drinking water contained 
elevated levels of lead. A local 

Student-run 
dystopian play 

explores high-tech 

future

By BAILEY KADIAN

Daily Arts Writer

“Just because it’s virtual, doesn’t 

mean it isn’t real.”

In a divide between a virtual world 

and reality, Jennifer Haley’s “The 
Nether” explores 
morality’s 
place 

within the digital 
realm.

This weekend at 

Studio One of the 
Walgreen Drama 
Center, Basement 
Arts, a student-
run 
theater 

organization, 
presents 
“The 

Nether,” a science-
fiction drama set in a futuristic 
world.

As I sat in on rehearsal, I quickly 

realized I was observing something 

far from familiar. The actors warned 
me about the dark nature of the play 
— and I soon discovered why.

“The Nether” is set in a dystopian, 

futuristic society where the Internet 
has become a series of virtual realms, 
called The Nether, requiring users to 
sign in and indulge in any desire they 
please. Detective Morris discovers 
one particular world, the Hideaway, 
and chooses to investigate this 
virtual reality.

This fictitious universe centers 

on crime, specifically pedophilia, 
and it raises questions of what’s 
considered ethical within the world 
and how behavior should be policed 
accordingly. For some clients of the 
Hideaway, the virtual is just as real 
as “reality.”

Though 
there’s 
immense 

darkness in the Hideaway, there’s 
also beauty. The joys of this 
virtual world are seen through 
visual design and the relationships 
between characters.

“The Nether has been able 

to capture trees and sensorial 
things that the real world no 
longer has,” director Maddie 
Rouverol, a junior in the School

Available classes 

have nearly 
doubled since 
semester’s start

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Since the summer, the 

University 
has 
nearly 

doubled 
the 
number 
of 

massively 
open 
online 

courses, MOOCs, it offers on 

both the Coursera and edX 
online platforms.

This includes 42 currently 

available 
courses 
on 

Coursera and two courses 
that will be available in the 
spring of 2016 on the edX 
platform, covering subjects 
ranging from programming 
and finance to classical 
music.

James DeVaney, associate 

vice 
provost 
for 
Digital 

Education and Innovation, 
wrote in an e-mail interview 
that MOOCs not only help 

faculty 
members 
teach 

larger audiences, but also 
serve as a testing ground 
for 
new 
educational 

technologies and strategies.

MOOCs 
are 
largely 

administered through the 
Office of Digital Education 
and 
Innovation, 
which 

partners 
with 
interested 

faculty members and helps 
them 
in 
planning 
and 

implementing their online 
courses.

Jim Hackett has 
served in interim 
role since Oct. 2014

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

The University will soon launch 

a search for a permanent athletic 
director, and Jim Hackett, who 
currently holds the position on an 
interim basis, will not be among the 
candidates, according to a Tuesday 
report in the Detroit Free Press.

Since being appointed interim 

Athletic Director on Oct. 31, 
Hackett has made waves around 
the Athletic Department. Most 
notably, he inked Michigan football 
coach Jim Harbaugh to a seven-
year contract worth roughly $5 
million annually, not including 
incentives, in December 2014. 
Harbaugh has led the Wolverines’ 
charge to a 9-3 regular-season 
record in his first year at the helm.

Hiring Hackett, in light of 

former Athletic Director Dave 
Brandon’s resignation, was one 
of the first major administrative 
decisions 
University 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
made 
after 

assuming the presidency in July

RUBY WALLAU/Daily

The Flint Water Plant is quiet now that all of the Flint River water has been emptied from the plant and the city returns to using water from the Detroit River. 

Flint Water Crisis Timeline

March 2013
Flint City Council votes to join Karegnondi Water 
Authority. The next day, Detroit tells Flint it will no 
longer sell water to the city beginning in April.

March 2014
The city of Flint announces it will begin sourcing its 
water from the Flint River on a plan managed by the 
city’s emergency manager.

April 25, 2014
Flint residents begin drinking water from the Flint 
River. Resident complaints about water quality begin a 
few weeks later.

September, 2014
The city issues a boil-water advisory after bacteria is 
discovered in some Flint water samples.

October 8, 2015
Snyder announces a $12 million plan to reconnect the 
city of Flint to Detroit water.

September 2, 2015
A Virginia Tech professor’s report says the water’s 
corrosivity is causing lead from the pipes to leach into 
the city’s water supply. 

September 25, 2015
Gov. Rick Snyder says the state will provide additional 
water filters for Flint, expand lead exposure testing 
and work to improve corrosion control during the 
water treatment. The administration says it is 
reviewing the option to return Flint to Detroit water.

September 24, 2015
Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha reports her findings showing 
a correlation between blood lead-level spikes in 
children and zip codes with heightened levels of lead 
in water samples.

January, 2015
Residents are notified the city has violated the Safe 
Drinking Water Act due to unsafe levels of TTHMs. 
Several members of City Council say the city should 
stop using water from the Flint River, and Detroit offers 
to begin selling Flint water again. Flint’s emergency 
manager opts to stay the course. The city later invests 
in new filters designed to curb the problem.

YALE UNIVERSITY

Faculty defend prof’s criticism

Forty-nine Yale University 

faculty members signed an 
open letter defending Erika 
Christakis, the faculty member 
whose October email criticiz-
ing the university’s guidance 
on culturally insensitive Hal-
loween costumes ignited cam-
pus protests, the Yale Daily 
News reported Monday.

Christakis’ e-mail criticized 

the efforts of Yale administra-
tors to remind students to be 
culturally 
appropriate 
dur-

ing Halloween. In the letter 
defending her, faculty mem-
bers argue Christakis’ e-mail 
spurred useful campus debate, 
and merely questioned how 
expression should be moni-
tored on a college campus.

“The email ... did not express 

support for racist expressions, 
but rather focused primarily on 
the question of whether moni-
toring and criticizing such 
expression should be done in a 
top-down manner,” the letter 
read.

In response to the e-mail, 

students 
have 
demanded 

Christakis and her husband 
resign from their posts in one 
of the university’s residential 
colleges.

Students at University 

of California, Berkeley 

criticize investment

Berkeley’s Afrikan Black

the school has invested $25 
million.

The students called Berke-

ley’s investment strategy “ethi-
cally embarrassing,” saying 
that corrections companies 
profit from the imprisonment 
of minority groups.

The companies in ques-

tion include the GEO Group, 
Inc., the Corrections Corpo-
ration of America and G4S. 
The ABC also denounced 
the school’s additional $425 
million investment in Wells 
Fargo, claiming that company 
also invests heavily in private 
corrections companies.

STICK IT TO ‘ EM

Speakers defend CSG member 
after Diag demonstration

Assembly also hears 

pitch for planned 

DPSS student 
advisory board 

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Several University students 

and former Central Student 
Government 
representatives 

appeared at Tuesday’s CSG 
meeting to discuss an incident 
last month that led representa-
tives from Students Allied for 
Freedom and Equality to call 
for the removal of a current 
CSG representative.

SAFE held a demonstration 

on the Diag on Nov. 17 during 
which organizers displayed a 
pretend wall designed to repre-
sent the wall separating Israel 
and the West Bank. During the 
demonstration, CSG represen-
tative Jesse Arm, an LSA soph-
omore, was recorded loudly 
confronting and criticizing the 
demonstrators. In response, 

SAFE asked CSG to dismiss 
Arm from the assembly.

LSA junior Matt Fidel, a for-

mer CSG representative, said 
he wanted to contextualize the 
incident for the assembly, say-
ing an 18-year-old named Ezra 
Schwartz was killed in a terror-
ist attack in the West Bank the 
same day as the demonstration.

“This was an American kid 

from Boston studying abroad 
in Israel,” Fidel said. “I can tell 
you from first-hand experience 
this was a very emotional day in 
the Jewish community.”

Fidel said after viewing the 

video, it was clear to him that 
Arm’s conduct was emotion-
ally charged, as he was upset 
about the killing of Schwartz. 
However, Fidel said his con-
duct was not disrespectful, as 
he was voicing his opinion on a 
topic about which he and many 
members of the Jewish commu-
nity felt strongly. He urged the 
assembly not to exclude Arm 
from the assembly.

“As a body, I’m not sure that 

CSG should be in the business of 
telling leaders on campus that 

they should not be standing up 
for what they believe in or voic-
ing their opinions on what they 
feel strongly about,” Fidel said. 
“To have this protest and then 
not even understand slightly 
why this may have been a trig-
gering experience for members 
of this community on campus I 
think is insensitive and also not 
really logical.”

Business senior Alex Adler, 

chair of University of Michi-
gan 
Hillel, 
echoed 
Fidel’s 

comments. He said Arm was 
triggered by a particular phrase 
on SAFE’s wall and acted 
accordingly.

“He reacted emotionally. I’m 

not here to say if that was right 
or wrong, but what I will say 
that he is not the only one from 
the Jewish community who felt 
triggered,” Adler said.

Adler said rather than inves-

tigating Arm’s behavior, CSG 
should encourage a facilitated 
conversation on campus from 
dissenting student groups.

Papers of famed assisted suicide 
advocate open at the Bentley

Historical library 
hosts collection 

from ‘U’ alum Jack 

Kevorkian

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Dozens of letters in the Bent-

ley Historical Library’s newly 
archived collection about Uni-
versity alum Jack Kevorkian, an 
advocate for assisted suicide, all 
read something similar to one 
written in December 1992: “Dear 
Dr. Kevorkian … I can no longer 
continue living like this. The 
quality of my life is totally dimin-
ished … I have nothing to look 
forward to but continued pain 
and loss of dignity.”

According to Lara Zielin, edi-

torial director at the Bentley 
Historical Library, the recently 
acquired collection includes art, 
papers and photographs from 

throughout Kevorkian’s life.

Ava Janus, Kevorkian’s niece 

and the sole heir to his estate, 
eventually donated the collec-
tion to the Bentley Library after 
his death in 2011. The collection 
was opened to the public in mid-
September.

The collection is of particular 

relevance since California Gov. 
Jerry Brown (D) signed the End 
of Life Option Act into law, which 
allows terminally ill patients the 
right to end their lives with the 
assistance of a physician.

California joined Washington, 

Oregon and Vermont in legaliz-
ing what is commonly known as 
physician aid in dying, or assisted 
suicide.

According to Bentley Library 

Director Terry McDonald, a his-
tory professor, the library was 
in touch with Kevorkian’s rep-
resentatives when he was still 
alive, discussing the possibility 
of his collection coming to cam-
pus. McDonald said that so far, 
the collection has generated a 

tremendous amount of attention, 
particularly from the media.

“Dr. Kevorkian was a gradu-

ate of the University of Michigan 
Medical School, and therefore 
his story is part of the University 
story,” McDonald said. “Of course 
he was a major figure in Michigan 
politics in the 1990s and the early 
part of the 21st century when his 
version of the ‘right to die’ debate 
became an important issue in the 
state. For both of those reasons, 
we wanted to have his archives 
here at the library.”

McDonald also said there 

is biographical material about 
Kevorkian’s youth growing up in 
Pontiac, as well as information on 
his time as a student in the Medi-
cal School and about his career, 
first as a pathologist and later as 
a “right to die” activist.

Not only was Kevorkian a phy-

sician, McDonald said, but he was 
also a poet and painter, as seen in 
examples of his various works 
displayed in the Bentley collec-
tion.

However, of most interest to 

people are the so-called “medi-
cide” files, which are the letters 
Kevorkian received from people 
who wanted him to help them 
with their death, and in some 
cases, videotape recordings of 
actual interviews with his cli-
ents, McDonald said.

“He was this compelling and 

really interesting person and, 
especially in Michigan, we know 
him as ‘Dr. Death’ and this ‘right 
to die’ guy,” Zielin said. “But he 
was so much more, and he has 
this long and interesting eccen-
tric and admittedly odd career.”

Mayer Morganroth, Kevorki-

an’s longtime attorney, said there 
are many public misconceptions 
about the doctor, the first regard-
ing the nickname “Dr. Death.” 
Morganroth said Kevorkian did 
not receive the name because he 
was bringing about the end of 
life; instead, he received it after 
inventing the oculi, an instru-
ment used to determine whether 
a person had died.

pediatrician’s report the week 
before had shown a significant 
jump in the number of Flint 
children 
with 
elevated 
blood 

lead levels, and those samples 
correlated with ZIP codes in 
which independent water samples 
pointed to lead contamination. 
State officials initially discounted 
the data. Eight days later, they 
reversed course. The city would 
again source its water from the 
Detroit River. For the residents of 
Flint, it was too little, too late. They 
had been ringing the alarm over 
the city’s water quality for more 
than a year, almost immediately 
after the city opted to treat its water 
in-house from the Flint River.

Flint had already planned to join 

a new pipeline, the Karegnondi 
Water Authority, which would 
eventually serve mid-Michigan 
and the state’s thumb. Knowing 
Flint had plans to leave, Detroit’s 
water authority said it would stop 
supplying water to the city. At the 
time, Flint was under the control 
of a state-appointed emergency 
financial manager who, in a cost-
saving move, decided that while the 
city waited for the KWA to come 
online, Flint would treat its own 
water for the first time in decades. 
Residents say officials brushed off 
their concerns again and again. 
They reported that water ran from 
their sinks discolored in browns, 
blues and yellows. Then came the 
hair loss, rashes that wouldn’t go 
away, rotting teeth, discolored 
shower tiles. In July, the city’s 
mayor drank a glass of water on 
local morning television to prove 
the water was safe. It wasn’t.

Melissa Mays, a Flint mother 

of four, had brought us here, 
to Calumet Street. Mays, her 
husband, and their four sons were 
all diagnosed with lead poisoning 
last year, and she’s spent months 
working 
with 
Shariff, 
clergy 

members, activists and a ragtag 
collective of Flint residents to 
pressure the city, the state, the feds 
— anyone, really — to do something. 
In their living room, about 10 
minutes from Calumet, Mays’ 
husband applied zombie makeup to 
all four kids, his own face and hands 
already covered in the white, red 
and black paint. Two candelabras 
decorated to look like they were 
covered in spider webs sat atop a 
tablecloth patterned with skulls. 
I slid into a chair next to Derek 
and Ruby, the Daily columnist and 
photographer who joined me on 
the trip. A row of electric guitars 
hung vertically across one wall, 
and another was plastered with the 
kids’ drawings and class projects. 
Mays and Shariff, who had come 
over for the interview, were seated 
on the table’s long side, and I asked 
how the whole debacle started. 
Mays spoke with dizzying speed, 
peppering a timeline of the last two 
years with talk of trihalomethanes, 
parts per billion, Freedom of 
Information Act requests and the 
federal Lead and Copper Rule. 
Mays is not a scientist or policy 
analyst, but it was apparent that, 
out of necessity, this research has 
ended up a full-time endeavor.

Not long after water started 

flowing from the Flint River and 
into taps and showerheads across 
the city, residents started noticing 
their water running yellow and 
brown. It smelled funny, and tasted 
strange, too. People were showing 

up at Flint City Council meetings 
displaying bottles filled with the 
brown-colored water. “It’s a quality, 
safe product,” Flint Mayor Dayne 
Walling said at the time. “I think 
people are wasting their precious 
money buying bottled water.” Four 
months later, water on the city’s 
west side tested positive for E. 
coli, and the city issued a series of 
boil-water advisories. Shariff said 
she only came across the alerts 
accidentally when clicking around 
the city’s website; Mays said she 
didn’t hear about them until after 
the third advisory.

By 
September 
2014, 
Mays 

had enough; she was convinced 
the problem was more than just 
bacteria. She said her cat was 
throwing up, her own hair was 
falling out and a splotchy red rash 
had started to stretch across her 
face. Mays’ 2-year-old niece was 
staying in the house then, and 
every time she took a bath, the 
toddler broke out with a rash all 
over her behind. The rash covered 
only the body parts where the tub’s 
water hit. Eczema cream didn’t 
help, and the child’s doctor couldn’t 
figure out what was wrong.

“And 
I’m 
like, 
‘What 
is 

happening to this kid?’ The rest 
of us were just used to it. Our skin 
was turning scaly,” Mays said. 
“My son — my middle child — just 
had rashes up and down his arms, 
and if you tried to put lotion on it 
— it just burned. It was chemical 
burns. It was on my face, my whole 
cheek bone. And any time you put 
anything on it, even makeup, you 
would just scream because it hurt 
so bad. But they’re on T.V. saying, 
‘Water’s safe, water’s safe, water’s 
safe.’ ”

In January 2014, the city 

distributed 
a 
letter 
notifying 

homeowners that the city had 
violated the federal Safe Drinking 
Water Act — not for lead, but 
for total trihalomethanes. The 
city’s water was found to contain 
a high level of trihalomethanes 
— 
a 
cancer-causing 
chlorine 

byproduct. By this point, members 
of City Council called on the 
governor’s appointed emergency 
manager to abandon the Flint 
River water source, and the city 
of Detroit offered to start selling 
water to Flint again. But Flint’s 
emergency manager opted to 
stay the course. To investigate, 
residents called in a water activist, 
who told Mays not only that she 
shouldn’t drink the water, but that 
she shouldn’t cook or shower with 
it either. And if the city didn’t have 
a lead problem now, he said, they 
would soon. Mays didn’t know it at 
the time, but they already did.

“When you’re boiling the water 

to make spaghetti, you’re just 
making all of those heavy metals 
and all the contaminants basically 
bond together, and you’re basically 
eating poison food. When you wash 
your clothes, the heavy metals stay 
in the fabrics so it’s rubbing against 
your skin all day and god forbid you 
sweat, you’re going to absorb all of 
that through your pores. So I can’t 
wash my dishes here, I can’t do 
my laundry, I can’t move because 
I’m 16 years into a mortgage and 
nobody’s going to buy my poison 
water house.”

Mays takes us into the kids’ 

bathroom. A five-step instruction 
sheet for showering was taped to 
the wall, written by Mays in neat, 
black marker. Step Two: Sit down 
and as the tub fills, use the cup 
and faucet to wash your face and 
hair. Rinse well. Step Four: Brush 

your teeth in the sink using bottled 
water and small cups. Don’t forget 
Q-tips. “Love You!” is scrawled and 
underlined across the bottom. Next 
to it another reminder: “Brush 
Your Hair!” I asked how the kids 
took to the new routine. “It makes 
them angry, and then once we 
found out about the lead, I took out 
the letting the water fill up, so they 
just used a big cup to let it go over 
their heads,” she said. “So yeah, my 
17-year-old son just loves that, to sit 
down and use a cup to shower and 
to use bottled water to brush their 
teeth.”

Mays brought in an outside 

expert to test the water — Marc 
Edwards, a professor at Virginia 
Tech University who specializes in 
water treatment. She said she drove 
62 of the test kits to neighborhoods 
across Flint, picked them up and 
helped residents complete them. 
The lead levels in water at Flint 
resident LeeAnne Walters’ house 
was averaging 2,500 parts per 
billion. Her family was losing hair 
and developing rashes, too. The 
legal level is 15. In a September 
2015 report, Edwards concluded 
that the corrosiveness of Flint’s 
water was causing lead to leach 
from the city’s aging pipes and into 
the water. The state maintained it 
was meeting all lead and copper 
standards.

On Sept. 24, Dr. Mona Hanna-

Attisha, a University alum and a 
pediatrician at the Hurley Medical 
Center Children’s Clinic in Flint, 
cross-referenced that data with 
information the county already 
had — blood lead levels for infants 
at ages 1 and 2, which the state is 
required to test for kids who are 
at a greater risk of ingesting lead 
paint chips in older homes. What 
she found: The number of children 
in Flint with elevated blood lead 
levels — defined as 5 micrograms 
per deciliter or more — had 
increased from 2.1 percent in the 
20 months prior to Sept. 15, 2013, 
to 4 percent between Jan. 1 and 
Sept. 15, 2015. In several ZIP codes, 
those figures increased from 2.5 
percent to 6.3 percent during that 
same time period.

“Everyone who has challenged 

the narrative — which was ‘the 
water is safe to drink’ — they were 
minimized,” Shariff said.

But the evidence built up, and 

eventually it was hard to ignore 
there was a problem. Finally, on 
Oct. 8, 2015 — nearly two years 
after 
Flint 
residents 
started 

drinking water from the Flint 
River — the state changed course 
and announced they had come 
up with a $12 million deal to 
allow the city to return to Detroit 
water. “I’m in full support of the 
return to the Great Lakes Water 
Authority,” Snyder said during 
the announcement. “We all care 
about the citizens of Flint.” Snyder 
promised to convene a task force 
— which includes a University 
professor and several University 
alums — that would determine 
what went wrong. Detroit water 
would again run through Flint’s 
pipes, and Flint’s parents could rest 
easy knowing their kids’ drinking 
water was safe.

But Mays says people shouldn’t 

be so quick to chalk the case up as a 
crisis averted. The story of water in 
Flint is not confined to that period 
of two years when the city’s water 
was unsafe for drinking — or by the 
final hurrah moment in October 
when the good guys fighting the 
good fight won the day. Flint’s 
challenges also reach further, into 

a history colored by the population 
loss and decay that made it easy to 
brush the city aside, as well as into 
a future that these two years will in 
many ways shape.

On the banks of the Flint River

You could argue the city of Flint, 

like a lot of cities, was born from 
the river. The confluences between 
city and water stretch back far — to 
a time when native people fought 
over the river’s banks. A handful 
of fords, where the river could be 
easily traversed, made the land 
highly sought after. In 1819, before 
the great industrial might of Buick 
City generated wealth and helped 
the city’s population grow, and 
before the city’s slide into poverty 
and decay, a fur trapper and his 
wife set up a post near the river’s 
banks. For the traders who came 
here — and to Michigan, a territory 
hugged on four sides by the Great 
Lakes — water was life-giving. The 
rivers provided habitat to beavers, 
and the water ferried birch-bark 
canoes downstream, piled up with 
pelts for sale back East and across 
the vast Atlantic.

In later years, Michigan’s rivers 

and lakes were clogged with logs, 
floated downstream for processing 
into lumber that would build 
this nation’s cities. The water fed 
the state’s growing agricultural 
economy as well as the companies 
that empowered the United States’ 
industrial might — industries that 
allowed old lumber towns across 
the Rust Belt to boom, before 
they would hemorrhage wealth 
and population a few decades 
later. Today, water is the basis 
for Michigan’s wildly successful 
“Pure 
Michigan” 
advertising 

campaign, which helps drive the 
state’s vibrant tourism industry in 
the towns dotting Lake Michigan. 
For a whole lot of Michiganders, 
their Michigan and their Midwest 
does not include the vast and 
aging networks of pipe that 
snake beneath the earth, nor the 
sediment-colored water of the 
rivers Rouge, Flint, Detroit and 
Saginaw.

“We connect to water very 

emotionally, we love our water, 
it’s Pure Michigan, it’s why that ad 
campaign really sings to us,” John 
Austin, a University of Michigan 
lecturer and co-author of a report 
on Michigan’s ‘Blue Economy,’ told 
me during a phone interview later 
in the week. “And so we appreciate 
that even more than this hidden 
water infrastructure that brings us 
clean water and is essential to basic 
life and health.”

Today, one in five jobs in 

Michigan are linked to water, and 
Austin said the state could play a 
major role in developing innovative 
ways to use water more efficiently, 
particularly as water resources 
grow increasingly strained. But as 
much as Michiganders — residents 
of a state whose surrounding Great 
Lakes contain 20 percent of the 
world’s surface freshwater supply 
— love their water resources, 
Austin says it’s easy to forget about 
the hidden infrastructure that 
delivers fresh water to taps on 
demand.

“What Flint really illustrates 

is … as a first order of business, 
we depend on water for life and 
that water has to be clean and 
available to people,” he said. 
“What Flint exposed is our water 
infrastructure — that in every 
community in Michigan we’ve got 
aged infrastructure and this shows 
that since we haven’t invested in 
remaking our water infrastructure 
— in rebuilding those systems — 
they can potentially kill us.”

For 
Austin, 
this 
dynamic 

illustrates the need to invest 
not only in infrastructure above 
ground, such as roads and bridges, 
but also in the infrastructure that 
sits below the surface. With debate 
over paying to fix Michigan’s roads 
reaching a boiling point last spring, 
Austin said people should be just 
as concerned with the invisible 
infrastructure — particularly the 
pipes that shepherd clean drinking 
water into our homes every day.

Through the pipes, below the 

ground

After Halloween, I spent a week 

trying to get into Flint’s water plant. 
When I spoke to Mike Glasgow, 
the city’s utilities director, on the 
phone, he told me how excited he 
was to hear young people were 
interested in municipal water 
delivery. But in the days leading 
up to the final reporting trip to 
Flint, the woman who handles 
his schedule kept telling me to 
call back later; she hadn’t had a 
chance to nail anything down. By 
Thursday evening, I wasn’t getting 
any response at all. I decided I 
would just show up at the facility 
anyway.

The Flint Water Treatment 

Plant sits on a sprawling campus 
just off the freeway. The complex 
is circled with tall chain-link 
fencing topped with barbed-wire 
spirals. A long driveway leads up to 
the main building, which is sand-
colored and doesn’t boast much in 
the way of decorative finishes. A 
white water tower hulks above the 
building, around which another 

half-dozen smaller structures are 
gathered. Only a handful of cars 
congregated in the parking lot, and 
a sign in one of the front windows 
indicated the office entrance is 
around back. Inside, the plant’s 
office was drab and dated. Paper 
maps hang on the paneled walls, 
and a collection of empty lead and 
copper water sampling bottles rest 
on a shelf nearby. I found Brent 
Wright, the plant’s supervisor, in an 
office lined with dozens of binders. 
Wright 
looked 
understandably 

confused when we enter. “Hi, 
we’re here for a tour of the plant,” I 
said enthusiastically. “Mike knows 
we’re coming.” I only half-lied. 
I started to sweat a bit when he 
dialed up Glasgow to make sure 
the story checked out, but when 
Wright hung up the phone, he told 
us, “The best place to start is from 
the beginning.”

Flint’s first water treatment 

plant was built in 1917. The original 
red brick building stands a few 
hundred yards from the present 
facility, and looks a lot like an 
abandoned 
automobile 
factory. 

Many of the square panes of glass 
are smashed in, and Wright tells 
me the roof collapsed a few years 
back. The city built a second 
facility, the current plant, in 1952, 
but it would only operate fully 
until 1967, when the city stopped 
treating its own water and started 
buying it from Detroit. During 
the peak of Flint’s prosperity 
and population, when sprawling 
factories turned thousands of 
GM cars off production lines, 
both 
plants 
together 
pumped 

100 million gallons of water per 
day. Today, with most of those 
factories shuttered and the city’s 
population significantly depleted, 
the Flint plant was only pumping 
about 16 million gallons daily 
when it last operated in October. 
In 1960, 196,940 people lived in 
Flint, according to the U.S. Census. 
Today, 99,002 people call this 
33-square-mile city home.

With the city back on Detroit 

water, there wasn’t much going 
inside Flint’s water treatment 
plant during the visit. The final 
gallons of Flint River water had 
just been emptied out the week 
before. A few construction workers 
wearing hard hats moved through 
the massive building’s darkened 
cement 
corridors, 
getting 
the 

place ready for the KWA pipeline 
to go live a few years down the 
road. The process for cleaning and 
distributing water is not incredibly 
simple.

2014. Schlissel has expressed 
his appreciation for Hackett in 
interviews with the Daily, saying 
his selection has led to a period 
of stability for a department 
fraught 
with 
controversy 

throughout Brandon’s tenure.

Hackett also earned praise 

from 
around 
campus 
when 

he penned an open letter to 
Michigan football fans in the 
wake of the Wolverines’ last-
second loss to Michigan State 
on Oct. 17, disparaging fans 
who sent angry messages to 
Michigan punter Blake O’Neill 
after his botched punt attempt 
led to a game-winning Spartans 
touchdown as time expired. 

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

coach John Beilein indicated 
soon 
after 
Hackett’s 
hiring 

that he would be willing to 
participate in a potential search 
committee 
for 
a 
long-term 

replacement. 
He 
reiterated 

that willingness on Tuesday 
following the Wolverines’ win at 
North Carolina State. 

“I think it’s really important,” 

Beilein said, recalling that he 
also participated in Brandon’s 
selection process. “When we do 
hire a new athletic director — 
when it comes, when Jim decides 
to step down — that the coaches 
are involved. Whether it’s me or 
another coach, it doesn’t make a 
difference.”

In a September interview with 

the Daily, Schlissel declined 
to outline a plan for filling the 
position.

“I’m not prepared at the 

current time to lay out a longer-
term game plan,” he said. “We’ve 
had a lot of stuff we’re doing 
right now. You know with the 
football 
program, 
when 
the 

head coach changes, the whole 
program changes.”

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald declined to comment 
when contacted by the Daily 
on Tuesday evening. Several 
members of the University’s 
Board of Regents could not be 
reached for comment Tuesday 
evening.

of 
MOOCs 
represent 
two 

complementary 
goals: 

increasing 
access 
to 
high-

quality education for global 
learners, 
and 
reimagining 

residential education for the 
21st century,” DeVaney wrote.

In an October interview with 

The Michigan Daily, University 
Provost Martha Pollack said 
there were several institutional 
priorities for digital education 
at the University as a whole, 
including 
online 
course 

offerings like MOOCs.

She pointed, in particular, 

to enhancing the residential 
educational 
experience 

through programs that track 
student 
analytics 
such 
as 

Student 
Explorer 
and 
Art 

Education 2.0, offering online 
degrees in a small targeted 
number of cases and engaging 
a global audience.

“We’ve been very involved 

in digital education now — 
for many many years, but 
particularly have ramped up 
the activity over the last four or 

five years,” Pollack said. “And 
I think it’s really important 
when we think about digital 
education, not just to think 
about MOOCs but to think 
about 
things 
like 
Student 

Explorer and Art 2.0 and all 
kinds of innovative ways that 
students and faculty can make 
use of the technology to have a 
better learning experience.”

Charles 
Severance, 

clinical 
associate 
professor 

of information who teaches a 
5-sequence Coursera course on 
Python programming that was 
launched this September, said 
global engagement was one 
of the biggest benefits of the 
platform.

Severance noted that his 

online student roster consists 
of a wide variety of ages and 
professions.

“There’s a lot of learners in 

the world and we’re meeting 
their demand as educators,” he 
said.

Pollack said she felt reaching 

a global audience is strongly 
in line with the University’s 
priorities.

“A third goal (of digital 

education) is to reach out 

to the world, just like we do 
when we write papers, or we 
do performances, or we do 
op-ed pieces to share what we 
know with the world,” she said. 
“And I think that that is just 
completely aligned with our 
mission as a public university.”

Severance said as a professor, 

the 
self-paced 
nature 
of 

MOOCs is also a significant 
benefit 
over 
traditional 

in-person 
classes 
because 

they allow him to add optional 
bonus lessons on interesting 
topics that would normally 
be left out in a semester-long 
residential course due to time 
constraints.

In his experience, he said, 

they’ve also proven to be less 
work during the semester. 
Aside from the phase where a 
MOOC’s lectures are recorded 
and 
the 
inaugural 
session 

where any errors are resolved, 
these courses often require no 
more than one hour per week 
of the primary instructor’s 
time.

However, 
Severance 
also 

noted that the self-paced and 
impersonal nature of MOOCs 
prevents instructors such as 

himself from placing the same 
kind of pressures on students 
that would be possible in a 
physical classroom.

“The only real disadvantage 

(with MOOCs) is that there’s 
no real time pressure, so we 
have to come up with ways 
to deal with this,” Severance 
said, adding that he typically 
structures a MOOC to be half 
the speed of a corresponding 
university course.

Because the courses are 

self-paced and many of the 
participants are not full-time 
students, time conflicts often 
prevent enrollees from being 
able to complete the course. 
Of the 209,628 visitors to his 
introductory 
Python 
class 

since September 15, only 18,162 
students had completed it as of 
November 30.

“It’s 
understandable, 

because they all have lives 
outside of online learning,” 
Severance said.

According 
to 
DEI, 
the 

University’s 
MOOCs 
have 

attracted more than 3 million 
users over the past several 
years.

Found in the eyes 

The burden of a broken record

W

ayne was 55 years old 
and had lived in Ann 
Arbor all of his life, 

he 
repeatedly 

told me and my 
two 
friends. 

His 
mother 

used to work at 
the 
Michigan 

Union. He did 
not have a job 
right this second, 
but 
he 
was 

going to do that 
tomorrow, bright 
and 
early. 
He 

promised. “I am 
a good Christian man,” he said as 
if persuading someone, though I’m 
not sure whether that someone was 
us or him. 

It was a Friday night. I had 

attended a poetry event with a 
few friends, and the words had 
electrically charged me, as words 
tend to do. After the reading, I 
asked the two of my friends who had 
stayed until the end if they wanted 
to take a walk; I needed the night air 
to calm myself down, I explained. 
We had meandered toward Main 
Street, walked the straight line 
and looped back toward campus. 
Across from the Ann Arbor District 
Library, he stopped the three of us.

My name is Wayne, he told us 

again. (I know this is repetitive, but 
I’m only telling you what happened.) 
55. Ann Arbor forever. Mom. Union. 
Good. Christian. Man.

I never understand why people 

state their religion after their 
character. I always thought a 
person’s nature to be mutually 
exclusive of their religion.

God Almighty, was he ever happy 

to see the three of us, because we 
were his angels. He had just come 
from the Union, he said, where 
another angel had bought him a 
toothbrush, toothpaste and other 
hygienic products. He took them 
out to show us, in case we were in 
disbelief, then safely zipped them 
back into his black bag.

I don’t have a job right this 

second, but I will get one. I am a good 
Christian man.

Did he think he would get a job 

because he was good? Or because 
he was Christian? I craved more 
discrepancy between the two, but 
one does not tell their cravings to a 
starving man.

Tonight I am staying there, he 

pointed at about 60 degrees, his 
finger projecting straight out into 
the sky. Please do not be pointing 
to Heaven, Wayne, I thought to 
myself. That high rise there, I sent 
out a silent prayer to whatever it is I 

believe in nowadays, all I need is 20 
dollars from you kind folks. Though 
my initial assumption may have 
been dramatic and I still did not 
know to where he was referring, 
I was grateful he wasn’t referring 
 

to death. 

“I’m sorry,” I heard one of my 

friends say. The other muttered the 
same. I looked down at my feet.

No listen! Wayne demanded, not 

harshly but fervently, I only need 20. 
It’s going to get cold soon, see. I am 
a good Christian man. (Did he mean 
to say that, being a Christian man, 
he was more or less likely to survive 
the cold?)

I wanted to tell Wayne all the 

reasons why I couldn’t help him. 
All I had on my person were my 
M-card, room key and the paper 
ticket from the free event we had 
attended earlier.

Wayne had all avenues covered: 

There is an ATM down the street. 
Wayne can wait here.

Payton does not have an ATM 

card, I wanted to say. Payton is not 
even a real adult. In typical fashion, 
I neglected to say 
anything. 
Wayne 

seemed panicked.

“Listen, 
Wayne 

…” one of my friends 
gently 
attempted 

to 
comfort 
him 

but also end the 
conversation, 
“I 

can’t give you any 
more money (she 
had found a few coins in her jacket 
pocket), but I can give you a hug.”

He absorbed the hug before she 

could take it back. There my friend 
was, hugging a stranger. It was 
a moment I had many words to 
describe — compassionate, brave, 
fragmentary, boundless — but not 
the right one. As I struggled to 
find any all-encompassing word, 
foreign arms stretched around me 
and instantly I tensed. My thoughts 
breathed heavily, trying to compose 
themselves as Wayne let go of 
me to hug my other friend. I’m 
apprehensive about hugging those I 
know; letting this man hug me felt 
like he had snuck into my heart.

After one freely given and two 

stolen embraces, Wayne took a step 
back. Just $20? His glance swept 
across each of ours; his eyes landed 
on mine and shook me. She believes 
me, doesn’t she?

I wished I could hide behind 
 

the moon.

She has the Holy Ghost in her eyes. 

I wondered if he was talking to God.

After a few brimming moments, 

a car pulled up next to where we 
stood. “Did anyone call for a ride?” 

A woman appeared from the fog or 
bush or nowhere (I really should be 
more observant) and jumped into 
the car.

Taking this as our moment to 

leave, I started to turn. “Good luck, 
Wayne,” a voice that wasn’t my 
own wished. The three of us stiffly 
staggered across the cement in 
silence. A friend cracked it, asking, 
“How is everyone?”

“A little broken,” I replied.
When finally I arrived home that 

night, I went straight to my mirror. 
As vain as it sounds, I needed to 
look at my eyes. What did he see? 
If he was making it up, was it based 
on anything? If he lied, was there 
anything in my eyes he missed? I’m 
not sure how to define whether the 
Holy Ghost is in someone’s eyes. 
I don’t think it’s based upon one’s 
religion, but why do people then hold 
it against themselves like a passport? 
Like it entitles or denies the entrance 
of my compassion?

I believed Wayne when he told us 

he was a good man, neither because 
of his religion nor despite it. What 

that faith was based 
upon, I’m unsure. It 
was partly because 
I am naïve, but 
there 
must 
be 

another 
reason, 

too. Judgment, I do 
know, shouldn’t be 
passed because of 
a title or category. 
Nor do I believe 

that good character can always be 
found in the eyes.

I stepped back from the mirror. 

The next morning, I awoke heavy 
from sleep and last night’s emotions. 
I was pacing around the room to 
reacquaint my body with the day 
when my roommate came in.

“How 
are 
you?” 
she 
asked 

energetically.

“Weird,” I responded.
It was all I felt that I could 

immediately give, so I turned the 
conversation to her.

“How was work?”
“Fairly uneventful, but there was 

this homeless man.”

My roommate works at the Union 

late at night. She talked further 
about “T” whose mother had 
worked at the Union. “T” a 55-year-
old man, an Ann Arbor man all his 
life, a Christian man. “T” who had 
showed her his new toothbrush, but 
also had shown her his sufficiently 
filled wallet.

She said he had told her he saw 

the Holy Ghost in her eyes.

S

ometimes I feel like a broken record.

Here I am yet again, tapping at my 

keyboard, writing another article about 

Islamophobia, trying to decide whether I think 
the world is getting better 
or worse.

Sometimes I feel like a 

broken record, but I keep 
writing because every time 
I meet people with new 
perspectives I see things 
through a different lens.

Last month, Gov. Rick 

Snyder issued a statement 
saying 
Michigan 
would 

temporarily stop accepting 
Syrian 
refugees 
in 
the 

aftermath of the attacks 
on Paris. Reading this, I 
looked up from the screen of my computer at 
my roommate — a Syrian refugee who came to 
Michigan almost two years ago. I met her last 
year when looking for someone to room with.

It didn’t take long for us 

to become family, and now I 
can’t imagine my life without 
her. The first thing I noticed 
about her was her hospitality. 
The day we moved in together, 
she was making herself lunch 
and she offered to make some 
for me as well, without even 
giving it a second thought. Her 
parents, though they speak 
only a few words of English, welcomed me as a 
part of their family. They take me out with them 
when they visit. Her mother worries about me 
the way my mother would, and asks to make 
sure I’m eating enough fruit. Her father spoils 
me the way my father does and gets me gifts 
when he goes out of town.

My response to Snyder and the 30 other 

governors who opposed allowing Syrian 
refugees into their states? As leaders of 
communities, you are acting in fear of people 
who are active and productive members of 
our society. To pause the acceptance of Syrian 
refugees sends an abhorrent message to not 
only our community, but also to those who are 
desperate for our help. This kind of reaction 
will not lead to the safety of the community, but 
will instead lead to a rise in Islamophobia.

Sometimes I feel like a broken record, but it 

feels like the world is just one big video game. We 
cannot get to the next level if we keep doing the 

same things.

After Snyder’s statement, I was happy to 

see people from different backgrounds aware 
and engaged in the conversation about it. I 
walked into one of my classes the day after to 
find some of my classmates, who were neither 
Middle Eastern nor Muslim, expressing 
frustration over Snyder’s decision. I saw The 
Michigan Daily editorial board as well as 
several columnists and students, both Muslim 
and non-Muslim, write articles condemning 
Snyder’s remarks. 

The killing of innocent people in Paris 

by ISIS, though horrific, was one of many 
tragedies that occurred that week. The ISIS 
attacks in Lebanon were less visible in the 
media and received less public empathy, 
though they happened one day before the 
Paris attacks. I had a friend tell me about how 
she couldn’t imagine how French students 
must have felt when they saw the news and 
didn’t know whether any of the victims were 
family. I have Lebanese friends who went 

through that same horror 
when attacks occurred in 
their hometowns.

Regardless of the Middle 

East’s 
reputation 
as 
an 

unstable 
region, 
human 

beings are suffering there. 
And people have a right to a 
secure life regardless of where 
they are. It’s disappointing to 
see friends and acquaintances 

who never talk about other countries suffering 
immediately stand behind the “Pray for Paris” 
movement. ISIS is an enemy to all innocent 
people, Muslim or non-Muslim. To all those 
people who changed their Instagram and 
Facebook profile pictures to “Pray for Paris,” 
what makes Parisians’ right to a secure life 
greater than the right of people in other regions 
in the world?

To clarify, I condemn the killing of innocent 

people in any region in any country in any part 
of the world. Oppression is not a competition. I 
pray for Paris and Lebanon and Syria and Iraq.

Blood is red no matter the color of a 

person’s skin, and the spilling of it should 
hold equal weight.

Sometimes I feel like a broken record, but I am 

trying my hardest to break the cycle.

The hazards of walking
E

very night, I walk through Ann 
Arbor and am struck by its beauty 
as a quintessential American college 

town. I hear the bell 
tower strike the hour as 
a runner sprints by; life 
seems to almost escape 
time and care. I watch 
friends exchange laughs 
at Espresso Royale over 
coffee and laptops. I notice 
the vitality surrounding 
me as I walk on with my 
headphones on, both a part 
of the movement around 
and apart from it.

Whenever I leave the 

Diag, my gait slows down around the Museum 
of Art. The red sculpture of an undefinable 
shape towers over me, a foreboding giant 
guarding the street. Lights of advancing 
vehicles blind me, thundering past oblivious 
students texting on their iPhones. The white 
stripes of the marked crosswalk before the 
Michigan Union glare at me, vulnerable to 
oncoming traffic. Students 
rush out, weaving between 
cars that brake just in time.

Every time, I take out my 

headphones before I check 
traffic and hasten across the 
street, watching aggressive 
cars at every step. It always 
crosses my mind that it’s 
incredibly dangerous that this 
crosswalk doesn’t have a panel 
to alert pedestrians of when it is safe to cross. I 
often am momentarily hit by the fear that a car 
playing reverberating music will strike me as I 
walk, severing me from the energy all around.

Though some might say this is an irrational 

fear, it is not ungrounded from reality. When 
I was a freshman, a driver in a Camry came 
within a foot of hitting me as I crossed this 
intersection at dusk. I felt a gust of wind push 
me as she hurled onwards. This experience 

isn’t exclusive to me. I have seen multiple 
students have close encounters with cars at 
this intersection, including someone who was 
on crutches.

Furthermore, masses of students cross 

this intersection on State Street every day, 
maneuvering between the buildings on Central 
Campus and elsewhere. State Street is one of 
the busiest roads in Ann Arbor, but this area 
is only protected by the white lines labeling 
a crosswalk. Though pedestrian safety isn’t a 
frequently discussed or sexy topic, it certainly 
is one that plays a significant role in our daily 
lives in a city as walkable as Ann Arbor.

It has become clear in recent months that 

Ann Arbor does have a particular problem 
with pedestrian safety. An August 2015 study 
conducted by the city’s Pedestrian Safety and 
Access Task Force found that pedestrians are 
at risk for injury in Ann Arbor. Since 2011, 
there have been 58 crashes per year involving 
pedestrians and vehicles. Eight individuals 
have died after being hit by cars between 2005 
to 2014 in Ann Arbor.

In October, the city of Ann Arbor adopted 

many 
of 
the 
resolutions 

suggested by the Pedestrian 
Safety and Access Task Force 
in their August 2015 study. 
One of the resolutions involves 
improving pedestrian access 
design, and I hope that the 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 

strongly 
considers 
adding 

a signalized panel at this 
popular crosswalk on State 

Street. I also hope that sufficient pedestrian 
safety measures can be extended to the 
popular crosswalk across from the College of 
Engineering on North Campus.

Walking in Ann Arbor is a privilege we 

all share, but it’s time that crosswalk safety 
improves in visible ways across the city.

TV NOTEBOOK

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Over Thanksgiving break I did 
what most college students home 
for the holidays do: avoid family 
squabbles, drink and eat a tad too 
much and binge watch the televi-
sion I missed out on in college. My 
long-weekend bender included 
making my family start “Grace 
& 
Frankie,” 
rewatching 
old 
“Scandal” episodes as my sister 
watched for the first time, binging 
the entire first season of “Jessica 
Jones” and finally watching the 
most recent episode of “Empire.” 
On “Empire,” the cliff-hanger 
before the fall finale depicted 
Jamal Lyon (a gay R&B singer) 
laying a smooch on Alicia Keys 
(sploosh). Jamal’s exploration had 
me thinking about my own sexu-
ality and its representation on 
mainstream television: Where are 
all the bisexuals?
Television has made enormous 
strides toward depicting gay and 
lesbian characters in program-
ming. Between David and Keith 
on “Six Feet Under,” Connor and 
Oliver on “How To Get Away 
With Murder,” the ensemble of 
“The L Word” and many more, 
gay characters have found them-
selves increasingly morphed into 
in-depth principal characters and 
no longer the recurring neigh-
bor. Nonetheless, one letter in 
LGBTQ hasn’t found itself as for-
tunate, which is to be expected 
in the slowly adapting TV world. 
I mean, how in the hell is Viola 
Davis the first African-American 
woman to win the Emmy for 
leading actress in a drama series? 
As she said herself, “You simply 
can’t win an Emmy for roles that 
aren’t there.” I sat and watched her 
speech with tears in my eyes, as 
did millions of others for the same 
reason: progress.
Of course, that doesn’t mean 
that the representation of minori-
ties on television is perfect, nor 
that of gay characters. Davis 
portrays the increasingly com-

plex defense attorney on “How 
To Get Away With Murder” who 
recently kissed a woman during 
primetime, one season after her 
husband’s murder. Is Annalise 
Keating bisexual? We don’t know. 
The plight of bisexuals on televi-
sion isn’t due to a lack of charac-
ters who enjoy sex with men and 
women — it’s a problem of seman-
tics. “Bisexual”: It’s a word fla-
grantly missing from the contents 
of my DVR and Netflix queue.
A prime example, which has 
been brought up before, is Piper 
Chapman on “Orange Is The New 
Black.” A show that has been a 
trailblazer for gender, racial and 
trans exploration and depiction 
somehow skated over its main 
character’s sexuality. Not once 
is the husband-having, Laura 
Prepon-banging 
protagonist 
described as “bisexual.” Clearly, 
I’m not here to decide Chapman’s 
sexuality — that’s up to her and 
her alone — but a storyline that 
centers on a woman’s enjoyment 
of relations with her husband 
and girlfriend is a clear segue to 
exploring a sexuality that faces 
much scrutiny, even inside the 
LGBTQ community. Why is such 
a progressive show shying away 
from bisexuality?

As most students do with 
research, I started at Wikipe-
dia. And it’s clear from the list of 
media portrayals of bisexuality 
that we have a problem. Maura 
Isles from the TNT crime-drama 
“Rizzoli & Isles” included with a 
description stating, “she has never 
been with a Frenchwoman, imply-

ing she’s been with other women.” 
Is this what bisexuality has been 
reduced to? Isles is 100 percent 
free to do whatever she damn well 
likes with whomever. However, 
does this simple absence of infor-
mation declare her a bisexual?
Bisexuality, from my experi-
ence, has been most criticized 
for lack of structure within 
the term. Does Jamal kissing a 
woman once after a season of 
being gay make him bisexual? 
Does Annalise’s kiss define her 
sexuality? Does Maura’s decla-
ration that she has never been 
with a French woman prove she 
plays for both teams? Not at all. 
It proves that now, more than 
ever, sexual exploration is prom-
inent in the media landscape, 
and for that exact reason, it’s 
shocking to see the dismissal of 
one-fifth of LGBTQ.
Sexual exploration deserves a 
place on television. Sexuality is 
undoubtedly fluid, and anyone 
may enjoy what they’d like as 
long as it’s between consenting 
adults. But bisexuality yearns for 
a more definitive role in today’s 
culture — certainly more so than 
being an underlying concept 
behind characters’ exploration. I 
don’t want a gay man who kisses 
one woman. Or a woman with a 
husband who has had relations 
with one woman. I want bisexual 
— a character who exemplifies 
what the word means. It’s not 
someone who just loves sleeping 
with everyone. It’s not someone 
who’s confused. It’s someone 
who actively chooses the label, 
instead of having it thrust upon 
them by writers’ subtleties.
And it’s not an either-or situa-
tion. I sat with tears as Viola Davis 
accepted her Emmy. A smile was 
plastered across my face when 
Jamal Lyon came out, and I adore 
Piper’s storyline. The representa-
tion and success of these charac-
ters and their respective shows 
exemplify the public’s readiness 
for honest, representative televi-
sion. I want to be represented.

‘Saints & Strangers’ 
a grim period drama

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

There’s 
nothing 
that 
says 
Thanksgiving like watching a 
dramatic reenactment of the date 
that 
inspired 
the 
holiday. 
If you know a 
thing or two 
about 
Ameri-
can 
history, 
the 
story 
of 
Thanksgiving 
isn’t exactly one 
of 
celebration 
and 
gratitude. 
In 
fact, 
the 
pilgrims 
who 
sailed the Mayflower faced rough 
living conditions and conflict 
with the Native Americans before 
and after the first Thanksgiving 
harvest. National Geographic’s 
two-part miniseries, “Saints & 
Strangers,” provides the audience 
with a bleak retelling of these 
events. Because it uses a period 
drama formula, “Saints & Strang-
ers” isn’t particularly refreshing 
or insightful. However, the mini-
series captures the gritty realism 
of the battle for survival between 
the natives and pilgrims. Even 
though the show draws from text-
book facts and gravitas in order 
to sensationalize Thanksgiving’s 
origins, the story is strengthened 
by dark visuals, fine acting and a 
chilling score.
Set in 1620, the first episode 
follows devout Englishman Wil-
liam Bradford (Vincent Kart-
heiser, “Mad Men”) and his 
harrowing journey on the May-
flower to the New World. Along 
with Bradford and his hapless 
wife 
Dorothy 
(Anna 
Camp, 
“True Blood”), the Plymouth 
pilgrims seek refuge in America 
from religious persecution in 

Europe. Once they reach a soon-
to-be Cape Cod, Bradford and 
the rest of his crew (Ron Liv-
ingston, “Office Space”; Ray Ste-
venson, “Thor”; Michael Jibson, 
“Les Misérables”) start building 
a community, only to run into 
trouble with the Wampanoag 
tribe, led by the dubious Mas-
sasoit (Raoul Trujillo, “Sicar-
io”) and his emissary Squanto 
(Kalani Queypo, “Slow West”). 
The second part, set a year later, 
delves deeper into the grow-
ing tensions between the tribe 
and the pilgrims, with hostil-
ity increasing on both sides. 
Despite several faults within the 
storytelling, “Saints & Strang-
ers” succeeds in other aspects.
While both parts of “Saints 
& Strangers” are lengthy, the 
sequences in each are briskly 
paced (the ride on the May-
flower only lasts for 22 minutes 
of the first part). Kartheiser’s 
impeccable 
performance 
as 
Bradford stands out among the 
rest of the cast, embodying a 
real-life figure coming to terms 
with loss, death, faith and sur-
vival in 17th century America. 
The same goes for Queypo’s 
fierce portrayal as Squanto, who 
also struggles to maintain sta-
bility in his life when his land 
and people are colonized. Both 
characters carry the plot along, 
as they fight for themselves 
and their fellow kinsmen while 
seeking to mediate a peaceful 
coexistence with one another. In 
order to accentuate the gloomy 
aesthetics of “Saints & Strang-
ers,” composers Hans Zimmer 
(“Inception”) and Lorne Balfe 
(“Terminator: Genisys”) infuse 
an intense score with somber 
strings and ominous drums. Yet 
even with all of its redeeming 
qualities, “Saints & Strangers” is 

missing an edge that could dis-
tinguish itself from other his-
torical dramas. 
Whether or not the events 
depicted in “Saints & Strangers” 
are inaccurate or offensive, the 
story is made to feel very one-
sided. The two monikers in the 
miniseries’ title indicate a type 
of prejudicial separation, with 
the Native Americans being 
marked as the “strangers” and 
the pilgrims as the “saints.” 
Granted, the writers of the 
miniseries probably took some 
dramatic liberties in order to 
make the story more gripping 
for television. But instead of 
humanizing both perspectives 
of the natives and pilgrims, the 
miniseries plays by strictly his-
torical means. The natives are 
portrayed as cunning, vengeful 
“savages,” whereas the pilgrims 
come off valiant and righteous. 
It seems as though the pilgrims 
aren’t given as harsh of a treat-
ment as the natives, despite 
laying their foundation onto an 
already occupied land and tak-
ing away resources from the 
natives. Perhaps white privilege 
doesn’t just exist in the realm of 
“Saints & Strangers,” but within 
the writing of it as well.
Given its historical relevance 
though, “Saints & Strangers” 
does a mostly adequate job of 
reproducing the characters and 
events during the first Thanks-
giving. But even with its dramat-
ic take on an iconic American 
event, the miniseries could have 
a more compelling twist had the 
natives been depicted in a more 
sensitive light. If you’re a history 
buff, “Saints & Strangers” can 
be captivating to watch. But if 
you’re not, then it may read like 
any normal high school history 
textbook brought to life.

TV REVIEW

We’re ready for more 
bisexuality on TV

of Music, Theatre & Dance, said in 
an interview with The Michigan 
Daily. 
The emphasis on autumnal 
yellow lighting and sensory details 
create a virtual domain more 
beautiful than reality itself.
While 
watching 
a 
scene 
between Woodnut, a participant of 
the Hideaway, and Iris, the child he 
desires, I saw both how disturbing 
their relationship was, as well as 
how happy they were. Woodnut 
wants the pleasure and beauty 
of a real relationship, though 
this desire doesn’t disregard the 
immorality of his indulgence.
“We’re trying to make the play 

more humane. It’s about human 
relationships,” 
Rouverol 
said. 
“We see what this vicarious world 
allows these people to become.”
The Nether is seen as a life 
outside of consequence, and the 
play considers whether or not that 
world can truly exist.
“In certain ways, The Nether 
gives you an opportunity to 
live a life that you couldn’t live 
otherwise and have an identity 
that you couldn’t have otherwise,” 
Rouverol said.
So could “The Nether” be 
viewed as a cautionary tale 
towards the effects of our digital 
world today? Rouverol thinks not.
“I think it’s actually shockingly 
and 
disturbingly 
unbiased,” 
Rouverol said. “I don’t think the 
world of ‘The Nether’ is that far 
away, and in certain ways, we’re 

already there.”
As liberating as the digital 
world 
may 
seem, 
Woodnut 
simply concludes, “Nothing here 
is truly free.”
With a cast of five, each 
character provides a different 
angle toward this virtual reality. 
Rouverol credits her experience 
as an acting student toward her 
new role as a director and how 
it’s contributed to shaping this 
work. She has been able to see the 
play as a larger picture and shape 
all aspects of production both on 
and off the stage.
“Sometimes when you’re in 
it, you can’t see the effect that 
your role is playing on the 
whole picture,” Rouverol said. 
“I feel really lucky to be able to 
do this.”

‘Good Dinosaur’ 
only for children

Pixar’s plot can’t 
match stunning 
animation

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

What if the asteroid that 
brought about the extinction of 
all dinosaurs never hit Earth? 
How 
would 
these 
crea-
tures 
evolve 
over 
millions 
of years, and 
how 
would 
humans 
fit 
into this equa-
tion? 
These 
are 
questions 
Pixar works to 
answer with its 
newest feature 
“The Good Dinosaur,” a senti-
mental flick about family, brav-
ery and survival. More than 
other successful Pixar movies 
though, “The Good Dinosaur” 
seems directed solely toward 
children, with a simple story 
that might leave older viewers 
searching for something great-
er. In other words, if you’re 
looking for a movie to cry over, 
this is it. But, if you’re ready 
for some of the more elaborate, 
well-developed 
storytelling 
Pixar has become known for 
with films like “Up,” “Finding 
Nemo” and “Inside Out,” then 
the film’s predictable, optimis-
tic resolution may fall flat.
The story reflects an old 
Western epic, opening with a 
picturesque family farm owned 
by a pair of dinosaurs along 
with their three children, Buck, 

Libby and Arlo. The small and 
gangly runt of the litter, Arlo 
can never quite find his footing 
within the group but is continu-
ally reassured by his father that 
he will one day be great. How-
ever, after Arlo fails at his task 
of catching the “critter” that 
continually steals their food, 
his father goes in search of it 
himself and is killed in a flash 
flood. As the family struggles 
to keep the farm running, Arlo 
is swept away in the river and 
finds himself miles from home 
with an epic journey ahead 
of him. Befriending the small 
“critter,” the prehistoric human 
called Spot who got him into 
this trouble, the duo works 
their way back toward the fam-
ily farm, encountering mali-
cious pterodactyls, a family of 
rancher T-rexes and a host of 
other adventures along the way.
Though the plot is varied 
and fast-paced enough to keep 
viewers interested, it’s the lack 
of a complicated main character 
that keeps this film from falling 
beside other Pixar super suc-
cesses. Comparing this to the 
animation powerhouse’s array 
of quest stories, the secondary 
characters that Arlo and Spot 
meet throughout their adven-
tures parallel “Nemo” ’s band of 
recovering fish-eater sharks or 
“Up” ’s crazed, dog-collecting 
pilot. But it’s the unpredictable 
and somewhat flawed main 
characters, like “Up” ’s soft-
hearted but crotchety Carl or 
“Nemo” ’s nervous and neurotic 
Marlin, that add a much-need-
ed third layer to those films. 
Though “The Good Dinosaur” 
pulls an unconventional move 
in reversing the master/pet role, 

making the dinosaur the master 
and the human the pet, the feral 
child Spot and good-hearted 
Arlo prove to be somewhat one-
dimensional as characters, and 
they struggle to hold the audi-
ence’s interest.
The film succeeds in its 
animation though, laying the 
cartoon-like characters over 
hyper-realistic 
naturescapes. 
It’s nearly impossible to tell 
when looking at scenes of the 
river flowing through the forest 
or the mountain peaks emerg-
ing from the clouds, that we’re 
looking at computer-generated 
scenes. Placing the goofy-look-
ing characters within this real-
ism makes the film relatable 
in a way that going completely 
one direction or the other 
wouldn’t. Overly realistic dino-
saurs wouldn’t inspire the same 
kind of sympathy the cartoons 
do, but an animated landscape 
would give the story no sense of 
importance and Arlo’s struggle 
no real validity.
Thinking about the title after 
seeing the movie, it seems like 
nothing I’ve said here is espe-
cially revelatory. Arlo, in any 
way you can describe him, is 
exactly what the film makes 
says he will be: he’s “good.” 
And though that doesn’t make 
for the most complex story, the 
film is nonetheless enjoyable, 
with a solid, predictable char-
acter leading viewers through 
a string of strange and excit-
ing adventures. If anything, the 
film proves that the Western is 
not a stagnant genre of the past, 
but a story of discovering one-
self. The fight against nature is 
a timeless quest regardless of 
the context it’s crafted in.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Thanksgiving with 
soulful CHERUB

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

It’s half past four and the 

Thanksgiving meal that my 
family spent two days preparing 
for has been devoured in less 
than thirty minutes. That in 
itself is a miraculous feat, but 
what is more exciting is that 
we’ve managed to finish our 
dinner with none of my elderly 
relatives 
saying 
anything 

extremely offensive. I take this 
as a win.

As I retire to the living room 

for my post-Thanksgiving nap, I 
decide the noise of the familial 
argument beginning to take 
place in the kitchen is better 
replaced by the sounds of my 
own music. The first song up 
on my Spotify Discover playlist 
is “Simple” by CHERUB, which 
is a band I’ve always liked but 
never truly appreciated enough. 
Nevertheless, in my turkey 
induced haze I take a liking to 
this song in particular and I 
pull up the rest of their album.

CHERUB is an electro-indie 

duo from Nashville, Tennessee 
formed in 2010. It consists of 
Jordan Kelley and Jason Huber 
who met in college at Middle 
Tennessee 
State 
University 

while 
studying 
music 

production. Building their fan 
base by making their songs 
payment-optional, 
CHERUB 

recently played at Lollapalooza, 
South 
by 
Southwest 
and 

Bonnaroo festival. Their debut 
album, Year of the Caprese, 
was released on May 27, 2015 
and combines genres like post-

disco, synth pop and funk. 
Their 
most 
popular 
song, 

“Doses and Mimosas,” charted 
at number 42 on Billboard’s 
Rock Airplay chart and 23rd on 
the Alternative Songs Chart.

Opening the album with 

“Simple,” 
CHERUB 
makes 

electronica soulful, combining 
traditional synthetic elements 
with 
meaningful 
lyrics. 

Reflecting, “I just want to live 
it all with ones I love / And 
simple minds lead to simple 
lives,” lead singer Kelley muses 
on his personal goals in life. 
Transitioning seamlessly into 
“Disco Shit,” the electronic 
elements stay and the serious 
lyrics leave. With a dance beat 
and psychedelic components, 
“Disco Shit” describes party 
culture 
and 
drug 
scenes, 

finishing the song with a muted 
sound like you’re underwater, 
presumably 
mimicking 
the 

effects of said drugs.

“This Song Is for You” is 

intimate and slows things down 
with a simple, syncopated synth 
beat, singing, “We were the last 
ones standing / Never knew 
that life would end up being so 

random.” It is slow, reflective 
and 
lyric-heavy, 
focusing 

on 
previous 
and 
broken 

relationships 
rather 
than 

wondering about the future.

Their most popular song, 

“Doses 
& 
Mimosas,” 
uses 

unusual sounds like the snap 
of the tab of a pop can to create 
an electronic pop sound. An 
extremely cynical chorus, “To 
all the bitch ass hoes / That hate 
me the most / Oh yeah, I hate 
you too,” probably played a role 
in “Doses & Mimosas” rise to 
fame amongst adolescents. By 
singing all the verses in falsetto 
and emphasizing the synth, 
CHERUB’s newest hit is unlike 
anything on the radio today.

“<3 
(Heart)” 
starts 
off 

similarly to the rest of the 
album 
with 
an 
electronic 

beat and pop-infused lyrics. 
However, the second half of 
the 
song 
devolves 
quickly 

into an acoustic cry for help. 
With nothing but a broken and 
strained voice backed by the 
plucking of a guitar, Kelley 
chokes out, “Just wait until I 
get the nerve to break / Your 
precious little heart.” In an 
unexpected, but not unwelcome 
twist, 
CHERUB 
showcases 

an entirely new side to their 
musical ability.

While CHERUB’s music is 

different from most popular 
musicians, the range of styles 
and topics it covers on Year of 
the Caprese should put it on 
the top of your “To Listen” 
list. And I can certainly attest 
that it is perfect for that post-
Thanksgiving nap.

Grimes empowers 
on hooky ‘Art Angels’

Latest from pop 
provacateur is 
entirely unique

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

Follow an artist long enough 

and even the most loyal of fans 
may not stay tethered. Both artists 
and 
listeners 

evolve, and not 
always in the 
same direction. 
For 
Grimes, 

the schism has 
begun: 
the 

release of Art 
Angels all but 
polarized her 
fan base. “She’s gone pop,” dis-
senters cry with disgust, tossing 
around descriptors like “selling 
out” and “going commercial” as 
if they’re natural synonyms for 
the genre.

They’re wrong; pop music is 

transcendental. Grimes plunges 
us into a millennial maelstrom 
of bouncy beats, hyper-digital 
samples and saccharine vocals – 
the kinds of songs that make you 
dance around your bedroom in 
your underwear for two hours 
straight. Fiery vocal delivery and 
song titles juxtaposed with a sup-
posedly “vapid” sound makes Art 

Angels a tool for empowerment, a 
sonic middle finger to anyone who 
dares belittle femininity.

Grimes eases us into this cru-

cible knowingly. The first track, 
“laughing and not being normal,” 
pairs breathy vocals and a tex-
tured orchestral sound, recreat-
ing the same moody minimalism 
we heard in previous albums. 
But surprise! it changes gears, 
launching us into jangly “Califor-
nia.” With lyrics like “what they 
see in me, I don’t see in myself,” 
Grimes directly addresses those 
who view her only as a concept 
rather than a living human being 
with a mind of her own.

This is the most we’ve ever 

heard her voice. Previously, her 
breathy vocals blended in like yet 
another instrument, but on this 
album, her voice slices a clean arc 
through fizzy earworm instru-
mentals. Layers of cyberpunk 
noise and frequencies bubble up 
in the background, but take sec-
ond stage behind radio-friendly 
guitar riffs and sing-along hooks.

Oft praised is “SCREAM,” 

the collaboration with Taiwan-
ese rapper Aristophanes that 
was originally released as a 
single. Together, the duo is your 
worst nightmare. Aristophanes 
commands the vocals, spitting 
out Chinese lyrics with cruel 
laughter overtop Grimes’s ani-
malistic screams and growls. 

Gym class whistles and adren-
aline-pumping guitar complete 
the hit-girl aesthetic.

Though “SCREAM” exudes 

destruction, it doesn’t feel out 
of place from the sugary-sweet 
tracks it segues into. Grimes 
said in an interview that she’s 
inspired by the Japanese arche-
type of cute and fearsome, 
which is a theme wound through 
the entire album. This dichoto-
my is best represented in “Kill 
V. Maim.” Its J-pop beats and 
cheerleader-style chorus may 
sound childish, almost artificial, 
but punctuated with spiteful 
screeches (“they don’t! know! 
me!”), it unveils the restless 
intelligence simmering behind 
the curated teen queen persona.

This theme is without a doubt 

the album’s greatest triumph. It 
acknowledges that feelings of 
rage, loneliness, infatuation, and 
empowerment can still be pack-
aged in a fun, high-gloss produc-
tion style. It develops pop music 
as a force to be taken seriously. 
It’s taken Grimes, as an artist, to 
a new realm of musical explora-
tion, leading her to collaborate 
with pop diva Janelle Monae for 
a song. And to anyone who criti-
cizes her ever-evolving sound? 
The closing line of the album 
says it all: “If you’re looking for 
a dream girl/I’ll never be your 
dream girl.”

FILM COLUMN

What’s in a name?

I

have a confession: I love 
“Rocky IV.” I love it for the 
cartoonish ‘roided up Russian 

Ivan Drago. I love it for the flashi-
ness that so aptly epitomizes the 
‘80s. I love 
that more 
than a third 
of its runtime 
is montage. 
I love that 
Rocky with 
his slurred 
speech and 
swollen face 
singlehand-
edly ends the 
Cold War by delivering a rousing 
victory oration about the values of 
being ‘Murican. I love it because it 
is the definition of excess, the kind 
of movie that gets played repeat-
edly on cable on slow Sunday 
afternoons.

I love the latest “Rocky” fran-

chise installment “Creed” because 
it is the exact opposite of “Rocky 
IV”: contemplative, emotional, 
slow, restrained. It’s a boxing 
movie where boxing serves as the 
vehicle to examine complex char-
acters dealing with real emotions 
and real conflict that’s internal 
rather than external. It’s a sequel 
that pays homage to its past but 
holds its own, and could function 
as a completely standalone work 
where no one had ever heard of 
the Italian Stallion.

“Rocky IV” reminds me that 

movies don’t always have to be 
high art, that they can be fun 
and exist solely for entertain-
ment. “Creed” reminds me that 
high art and entertainment can 
exist as one — it reminds me of 
why I love movies.

I realized what makes “Creed” 

so special very early on: a quiet 
scene where young Adonis Creed 
watches a YouTube clip of his long 
ago deceased father Apollo fight-
ing Rocky from one of the early 
“Rocky” films. The clip is pro-
jected onto the wall and blown up 
so Creed and Balboa appear quite 
large in stature. Though the foot-
age looks grainy, the ferocity on 
the faces of these fighters remains 
clear. The amateur boxer Adonis, 
dressed in shirt and tie, watches 
for a moment, but then rises and 
approaches the screen and begins 
to shadow the movements and 
punches of the fighters. At first 
it seems touching, a son walking 

in the footsteps of his father. But 
Adonis isn’t mirroring Apollo, nor 
is he fighting Rocky — he’s fight-
ing Apollo.

This image so perfectly cap-

tures the essence of the film: a son 
grappling with the legacy of his 
father, a legacy he didn’t ask for 
from a father that left him before 
he was born. Boxing is just the 
physical representation of this 
very personal conflict.

That’s why cinema is so fond 

of the boxing/fighting film. There 
is no greater exemplification of 
the personal struggle than the 
fighter’s quest for greatness: it’s 
boiled down and raw and brutal. 
Emotional tension can be felt, 
but physical confrontation — the 
crack of a rib, the spray of blood 
on the ring — these sounds and 
images resonate and boom. And 
when these physical struggles 
mesh with and mirror the more 
personal, emotional struggles, 
the audience becomes absorbed 
in the characters. Suddenly, their 
fight becomes our fight too. And in 
“Creed” the emotions resonate so 
loudly because its fight is so per-
sonal and human.

Watching “Creed,” I felt like 

I sat ringside, cheering on our 
protagonist. And it wasn’t sim-
ply because the camera weaves 
between the fighters to create a 
sense of 360 degree immersion, 
nor was it because of the use of 
surround sound that places char-
acters in front of and behind the 
audience so as to propel us smack 
into the middle of the scene. It 
was because I cared, because I 
could relate. 

Growing up, family and friends 

remarked how much I resembled 
(still resemble) my father: the 
same appearance, the same sense 
of humor, the same walk, the 
same voice, the same manner-
isms, the spitting image of my 
father. And so for years I could 
only compare myself to him: was 
I as smart as he was when he was 
my age, was I as personable as 
him, was he stronger than me, 
faster than me, what could he 
do that I couldn’t, and why 
couldn’t I do it too. Up until 
this past April, I was studying 
to go to medical school in large 
part (though not completely) 
because my father did — not 
because he wanted me to, but 
because I was still competing 

with him, with his name.

But his name is my name, and 

names and legacies do not make 
an individual. They are inescap-
able and immutable, they help 
shape an identity, but they do not 
define that identity. And at some 
point I realized that I am my 
father’s son and I bear my father’s 
name, but though he has pro-
foundly influenced who I am, I am 
not my father.

And so Adonis reaches the 

same conclusion by the finale of 
“Creed,” though he achieves that 
catharsis through sweat and blood 
rather than self-contemplation. 
But his internal fight to define his 
own self-worth is universal; who 
among us has not compared him-
self to a parent, a family member, 
a friend or even a younger, more 
successful self?

This idea of names, the weight 

they carry with regards to one’s 
pride, is a powerful concept, far 
more powerful than an uppercut 
to the jaw or a quick left jab to the 
ribs. And “Creed” plays up the 
concept in so many ways: by jux-
taposing a young character with 
an absent but well-established, 
legendary figure and by contrast-
ing an aging Rocky with constant 
reminders of his youth and suc-
cess, but also by “Creed” ‘s very 
existence as a sequel to one of the 
most beloved films of all time.

When a film taps into all of 

these deeper levels — narratively, 
metaphorically, existentially 
— yet still entertains as a crowd-
pleaser, that excites as a sports 
picture, that moves as an inter-
personal drama and manages to 
reflect in its characters a struggle 
universal but individual, then 
that film becomes something 
more, something worth remem-
bering and cherishing.

I could never relate to “Rocky” 

the way so many did when it 
came out in 1976. But I under-
stand “Creed,” I understand this 
struggle and this fight and this 
identity crisis. I understand the 
image of a young man shadow-
boxing a ghost. “Creed” is not 
“Rocky,” but it is my “Rocky,” the 
underdog sports drama I’ll think 
back on for years to come.

Wolverines build 
lead early in second 
half, hold off N.C. 
State on the road

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

RALEIGH, N.C. — Duncan 

Robinson smirked at his bench. 

After the Wolverines trailed, 

then led, and then came close 
to trailing 
once 
more, 
the 

redshirt 
sophomore guard sank his fifth 
3-pointer with 6:48 left in the 
game to give the Michigan men’s 
basketball team the cushion it 
needed to hang on to its lead and 
beat North Carolina State, 66-59.

“We showed great fight down 

the stretch,” said senior guard 
Caris LeVert. “They made a 
run — we knew they would — 
their crowd got behind them, 
but we still stuck together. We 
made some big baskets down the 
stretch. Duncan’s 3 and Zak’s 3 
were huge for us, we got stops 
when we needed and rebounded 
well, and that’s what got us over.”

For the first 10 minutes 

of 
Michigan’s 
Big 
Ten/ACC 

Challenge matchup at N.C. State, 
it appeared the Wolverines were 
going to fall to the Wolfpack in a 
similar fashion to their first two 
losses — with poor shooting and a 
lack of an impactful big man.

Michigan (5-2) started the 

game shooting just 2-for-9 from 
the field, but with 10:12 left in 
the first half, Robinson ignited 
the Wolverines with a 3-pointer 
that put them one point short of 
the Wolfpack, 11-10. What started 
as a game dominated by N.C. 
State quickly descended into a 
back-and-forth contest, with the 
two teams exchanging leads five 

times in the next two minutes.

But once Michigan grabbed 

control, it never lost its lead.

Freshman 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner, 
who 
came 
in 
for 

sophomore 
big 
man 
Ricky 

Doyle four minutes after the tip, 
awakened the Michigan bench 
with a monster one-hand slam 
with 8:06 to go. Wagner collected 
four fouls over the course of the 
game but emerged as a steady 
backup with eight points on 
4-for-7 shooting.

“I think that’s kind of my 

thing, to give the team energy,” 
Wagner said. “I think that’s what 
people ask me to do, and I really 
enjoy that role.”

After 
opening 
the 
game 

shooting 
2-for-9, 
Michigan 

made its next seven of eight. 
Robinson had a big part of 
Michigan’s late control. He hit 
two 3-pointers in a row to give 
Michigan a comfortable seven-
point lead. The Wolverines 
maintained that lead, going into 
halftime up 34-26.

After 
junior 

guard 
Derrick 

Walton 
left 
the 

game late in the 
first frame with 
a 
slight 
sprain 

on his left ankle, 
sophomore guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman 
started the second 
half and played 
the bulk of the 
minutes at point 
guard. 

Senior 
guard 

Spike 
Albrecht, 

who has played 
only spot minutes 
while 
rehabbing 

his hips, was also 
able to make an 
appearance. 
He 

got on the court 
with 
14:46 
left 

in the game after 

keeping his sweats on during the 
first half. Just 19 seconds later, 
he fed senior guard Caris LeVert 
for an alley-oop dunk that gave 
Michigan a 15-point lead. 

The 
Wolfpack 
gradually 

whittled the Wolverines’ lead 
over the next minutes, led by 
forward 
Caleb 
Martin, 
who 

scored 10 points on a 12-1 run to 
make the score 46-42.

LeVert’s 
steady 
dominance 

made it impossible for the 
Wolfpack to come all the way 
back, scoring 18 points, dishing 
out seven assists and grabbing 
nine rebounds. And with help 
from Robinson, who ended the 
game with 17 points on 6-for-
8 
shooting, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

confidence was on full display. 

“(Robinson’s 
shooting) 
is 

deadly,” LeVert said. “When he 
hits a couple in a row, you wanna 
look for him every time you can. 
… He just knocks them down.

“If we were playing against a 

guy like Duncan, we would never 
leave him open.”

LeVert, Michigan hold off Wolfpack

Abdur-Rahkman, 
Albrecht pick up 
slack with Derrick 
Walton Jr. injured

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

RALEIGH, 
N.C. 
— 
The 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
was finally starting to roll in its Big 
Ten/ACC Challenge showdown 
against North Carolina State, 
but on the Wolverines’ bench, 
Derrick Walton Jr.’s face was 
buried in a towel.

The junior guard had just 

helped the Wolverines break 
an early tie with a 10-0 scoring 
run, but after Wolfpack forward 
Maverick Rowan ended the 
drought 
with 
a 
3-pointer, 

Walton came up grabbing his 
left ankle in pain.

Walton 
— 
who 
missed 

Michigan’s final 12 games last 

season with a toe injury in the 
same foot — hid his face during 
a brief examination on the bench 
before slowly limping to the 
locker room moments later. He 
was officially diagnosed with a 
slightly sprained ankle and did 
not return for the second half, 
leaving the Wolverines without 
their floor general.

Fortunately for Michigan, the 

rest of its offense came ready to 
play to the tune of a 66-59 victory, 
even without Walton’s direction.

Just 11 days after his 29 points 

weren’t enough to down Xavier 
at Crisler Center, junior guard 
Caris LeVert proved the offense’s 
success could stem from his own 
performance. LeVert essentially 
ran the point for most of the second 
half, and his 18 points, seven 
assists and nine rebounds were all 
team highs. More importantly, his 
poise and persistence — perhaps 
best exemplified by his buzzer-
beating jumper to end the first 
half — kept the Wolverines from 
taking their feet off the gas.

“Coach came to 

me and told me I 
was gonna be the 
lead guard in the 
second half,” LeVert 
said. “Derrick’s our 
brother out there, 
so we wanted to get 
the win for him. He 
played so well in the 
first half offensively 
and defensively, we 
knew (the rest of us) 
had to play well in 
that game.”

Redshirt 

sophomore 
guard 

Duncan 
Robinson 

showed 
he 
also 

possesses the same 
3-point 
shooting 

prowess as Stauskas 
and can take over a 
close game with his 
shooting.
Robinson knocked 

down five of his seven 3-point 
attempts on his way to 17 points, 
including a huge triple with just 
under seven minutes remaining 
to extend a narrow four-point 
lead to seven.

“When (N.C. State) pushed 

hard, we needed somebody to 
step up,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “(That last 3) 
was probably the only bad shot 
Duncan took, but it was one of 
those, ‘No, no, no ... that’s my guy 
(after he made it).’ “

LeVert may have been the 

de facto point guard for the 
Wolverines in the second half, but 
both sophomore Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman and senior 
Spike Albrecht were needed for 
meaningful minutes. 

Abdur-Rahkman

no 

stranger to being unexpectedly 
thrust into action thanks to 
last year’s injury problems, and 
though he didn’t light up the box 
score, his experience showed in 
his defensive matchup with N.C. 
State leading scorer Anthony 
“Cat” Barber.

Albrecht, 
meanwhile, 
was 

dressed in sweatpants for the 
first half in keeping with Beilein’s 
stated plan to focus on rehabbing 
from his offseason hip surgeries. 
But after Walton went down, 
Albrecht came out in uniform for 
the second half. The ailing senior 
played just five minutes, but he 
punctuated his brief time on the 
floor by lobbing a perfect alley-
oop to LeVert.

At 
least 
for 
tonight, 
the 

Wolverines proved they could 
survive a tough road matchup 
without a true point guard 
thanks to stellar play from LeVert 
and Robinson. But with Walton’s 
health now up in the air — he will 
be reevaluated before Michigan’s 
game Saturday against Houston 
Baptist — and Albrecht’s road to 
recovery still dragging on, only 
time will tell if that offensive 
productivity is sustainable.

A look at Michigan’s competition

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

With three days until the puck 

drops on the Big Ten hockey sea-
son, the conference is a mess. All 
six teams have laid more than 
their fair share of goose eggs. In 
fact, just two teams enter confer-
ence play with a winning record.

In 16 games against the 

National Collegiate Hockey Con-
ference, considered the country’s 
strongest this year, the Big Ten 
has lumbered to a 1-14-1 record. 
No. 12 Michigan and Penn State 
have managed to separate from 
the pack just by playing respect-
ably.

It’s too early to be certain, but 

more than one Big Ten team mak-
ing the NCAA Tournament looks 
hopeless.

With the Wolverines (7-2-2) 

hosting Wisconsin on Friday at 
Yost Ice Arena for the start of a 
weekend series, the Daily breaks 
down the competition across the 
conference.

Penn State (8-2-3)

There are no two ways about it 

— the Nittany Lions are a strong 
team.

The young hockey program 

has grown at an incredible pace 
over the last four years, and this 
season is no exception. Goalten-
der Eamon McAdam holds the 
best goals-against average and 
save percentage in the confer-
ence.

Penn State also ranks first in 

goals per game (4.15) and goals 
allowed per game (2.38). Yes, the 
team’s strength of schedule is 
undeniably weak — ranked 46th 
out of 60 teams. The Nittany 
Lions didn’t help themselves with 
a loss to unranked Notre Dame 
and a tie with a Niagara team that 
Michigan handled easily.

But the numbers don’t lie, and 

Penn State can suffer significant 
drops in productivity without 
another team in the conference, 
aside from of Michigan, sniffing 
its statistical leads.

Wisconsin (3-5-4)

The Badgers opened the 2015 

season with six winless games. 
The competition was stiff at 
times, including visits to No. 10 
Boston University and No. 1 Bos-
ton College, but the 0-3-3 start 
likely dashed any chance for an 
at-large bid for the postseason.

Wisconsin followed the slow 

start with several good perfor-
mances against top teams like 
No. 4 North Dakota and No. 9 
Denver. This weekend’s trip to 
Michigan finally gives the Bad-
gers the chance to right the ship 
once and for all.

The most severe correction 

needs to take place in the offen-
sive zone. Wisconsin is averaging 
a dismal 2.33 goals per game, last 
in the Big Ten, and has scored 
just three even-strength goals all 
season.

Freshman goaltender Matt 

Jurusik has been a nice addi-
tion since he took over the start-
ing role. Jurusik has posted a 
respectable 2.89 goals-against 
average and save percentage of 
.906. Those numbers are par-
ticularly 
impressive 
because 

they come against the high-pro-
duction offenses that Wisconsin 
faced in non-conference play.

Michigan State (4-7-2)

The 2015 season has not been 

kind to the Spartans. After fin-
ishing second in the Big Ten last 
season, Michigan State is heading 
into conference play with seven 
losses.

Four of those defeats came in 

definitive sweeps at the hands of 
North Dakota and Denver. The 
Spartans were outscored 14-4 in 
those contests. In games against 
the top 20 this season, the team 
is 0-6-1.

Besides the strong strength of 

schedule, ranked No. 22, there 
aren’t a lot of positives thus far for 
Michigan State. Defensively, the 
Spartans rank near the bottom 
of the Big Ten. Their goals-per-
game average of 3.00 is good for 
19th in the nation, but it is hardly 
enough to make up for the lapses 
on the other end.

Even worse, Michigan State 

doesn’t look likely to improve 
in the short term. The Spartans 
have another tough test this 

weekend when they travel to 
Penn State.

Minnesota (4-7-0)

One of the conference’s big-

gest disappointments remains 
an enigma. The Golden Gophers 
have talent in bunches, but lack 
even one signature win after 
playing several strong teams.

The Minnesota are the only 

Big Ten team to make the NCAA 
Tournament in each of the three 
years since the conference’s 
founding. But a shaky non-con-
ference performance did the 
team no favors toward retaining 
that distinction.

The Golden Gophers looked to 

be turning it around after a slug-
gish start to the season before 
being swept by No. 7 St. Cloud 
State last weekend. Now, ques-
tions surfaced about how good 
they really are.

Several 
notable 
departures 

this spring make it likely that 
Minnesota will rebound to bet-
ter form as the season continues, 

none more significant than goal-
tender Adam Wilcox. Wilcox left 
early to sign with Tampa Bay and 
currently plays in the AHL, but 
Eric Schierhorn has performed 
well in his absence. The fresh-
man posted a .916 save percent-
age through 11 games.

On a positive note, the future 

does look bright for the Golden 
Gophers — if only because Ohio 
State is on the horizon.

Ohio State (3-9-0)

The Buckeyes are awful.
Junior goalie Matt Tomkins 

ranks last in the Big Ten in save 
percentage, goals-against aver-
age and winning percentage. It’s 
certainly not fair to heap all of 
the blame on the netminder, but a 
3.20 goals-against average makes 
it nearly impossible to win games.

Ohio State travels to Min-

nesota this weekend, looking to 
improve an 0-6-0 record on the 
road. While a loss isn’t definite, 
one thing is: It’s going to be a long 
season in Columbus.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Thome, Dunston 
fill gaps on glass

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

After Cyesha Goree graduated, 

the Michigan women’s basketball 
team lost a center who averaged 
more 
than 

10 
rebounds 

a 
game. 

Heading into the 2015 season, 
the Wolverines were in need of a 
replacement.

Enter 
Hallie 
Thome. 
The 

freshman center and former Ohio 
Ms. Basketball is supposed to get 
rebounds. After all, she is 6-foot-5.

“It’s nice to have that post 

presence inside,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico on 
Tuesday to WTKA. “And I know 
we worried about it this year, 
losing (Goree).”

Expectations haven’t entirely 

been met, though. Thome has 
pulled down 28 rebounds through 
six games for the Wolverines. 
Averaging 4.7 boards per game 
isn’t exactly what one would 
expect from someone of Thome’s 
size. She isn’t playing poorly by 
any means — hitting a remarkable 
76.6 percent of her shots — but 
her lack of aggressiveness on the 
glass seems to negate her height 
advantage.

The 
Wolverines 
focus 
on 

rebounding every day in practice, 
and assistant coach Melanie 
Moore works with Thome one on 
one, challenging her to grab more 
boards. When the whole team 
gets together for the rebounding 
drills, it tends to get pretty 
intense.

Barnes Arico will typically 

put five of the team’s practice 
managers around the arc, and 
the Wolverines all line up on 
the free throw line. When the 
coach shoots the ball up toward 
the backboard, the players turn 
around, find a manager to block 
and grab the rebound.

If a player fails to block out one 

of the practice managers, she is 
taken off the court.

Drills like these are what 

Thome needs in order to become 

more aggressive. She has great 
hands and finishes around the 
rim better than anyone Michigan 
has faced so far, but she still 
hasn’t filled the rebounding void.

Making up the lost ground 

is sophomore forward Jillian 
Dunston. A new addition to the 
starting five, Dunston leads the 
team with 49 rebounds — twice 
as many as Thome. Dunston and 
Thome are essentially opposites. 
What the 5-foot-11 Dunston lacks 
in height, she makes up for with 
her tough, gritty attitude in the 
paint.

Sunday, 
the 
Wolverines 

outrebounded 
Oral 
Roberts, 

37-33, and Dunston led the way 
with nine. Michigan was actually 
trailing the Golden Eagles in 
rebounds at the end of the first 
half, but it came back to dominate 
the boards after the break. 

STAYING 
UNBEATEN: 

Michigan is 6-0 for the first time 
since the 2011-2012 season. Not a 
single opponent has lost by less 
than 15 points, and it’s largely due 
to the Wolverines’ deep roster.

“I don’t know as a coach how 

many times in my career I’ve had 
(this much depth) before,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Usually you have a 
couple players that can score, but 
not eight or nine. We have eight 
or nine that can be our leading 
scorer on any given night, or at 
least make a big basket.”

Michigan is deepest at the 

guard position, led by junior 
Siera Thompson and sophomore 
Katelynn Flaherty. There are 
about 
six 
guards 
that 
play 

double-digit minutes every game, 
but it’s not because Barnes Arico 
is playing a four-guard lineup.

Barnes Arico has tended to 

keep two forwards in most of the 
time, rotating Thome, Dunston 
and senior Kelsey Mitchell.

It’s a good problem to have, but 

no matter the depth, Michigan’s 
undefeated streak is going to 
be put to the test this week 
with games against Pittsburgh 
and Princeton, both of which 
defeated the Wolverines last year.

Another Thing: I loved Katharine Hepburn

H

ere’s what kind of happened.

It was a Wednesday night. I was 

doing what I always do on Wednesday 

nights: sitting on my couch, sucking the skin on 
the back of my hand, thinking about the bank-
ing crisis, when...

“How do you do, Mister Beh-nard?”
I gasped!
Who had materialized in my room, but none 

other than Hollywood starlet and four-time 
Oscar winner Katharine Hepburn! She was 
perched in my desk chair, legs crossed, head 
thrown back, a martini dangling from her fin-
gernails real seductive like a snake teething a 
yo-yo.

“What are you doing here, Katharine Hep-

burn?” I un-sucked my hand. “Shouldn’t you be 
in the Golden Age of Hollywood?”

“Oh, Mister Beh-nard,” Katharine Hep-

burn said. “Who could ever be as astute as you? 
You’re hallucinating ... simple as that, Profes-
sor.”

“Yeah ... ”
“Besides, a girl can enjoy the view, can’t she?”
“Hee-hee-hee ... ”
For the next week, my hallucination of Kath-

arine Hepburn and I did everything together. 
She showed me “Citizen Kane” and “The Phila-
delphia Story.” I showed her “Space Jam.”

In the evenings, we ate at Chophouse (on 

her) and South Quad (on me). Except, the thing 
is, no matter where we went, no matter how 
many times I told our waiter I’d be dining with 
a redheaded, sharp-tongued, film-icon-legend 
lady, they never brought Katharine Hepburn 
any food! So I gave her some of my chicken ten-
ders.

At night, we waltzed on rooftops. I’d say 

she looked “really hot” and she’d tell me I was 
“incorrigible,” then I’d say that word was “really 
hot” and she’d say, “Thanks, doll,” and I’d say, 
“Wel-come!” and she’d smirk and double back-
flip off the roof, onto a horse, and I’d take the 
stairs.

And yet despite it all, if you can believe 

it, Katharine Hepburn was super insecure, 
always calling herself a “damn fool,” a “silly lit-
tle thing,” insisting she was unlovable, unfeel-
ing, made of “bronze.”

And I was all like, “What? You? Bronze? 

Aren’t pennies made from bronze? Wait, nah, 
that’s copper. Never mind.”

And then Katharine Hepburn would be all 

like, “I don’t expect you to understand.”

And then I’d be all like, “Maybe, I don’t. 

Maybe I don’t understand. But, wow, look at 
you. I mean, Jesus. I’m so lucky. Your eyes are 
so real, I never saw eyes so real. I’d touch ’em if it 
wouldn’t be so uncomfortable for you.”

And then she’d start crying, and I’d ask, 

“What is it?” and she’d say, “Shut up, keep talk-
ing,” so I would:

“I’m no good with words. I’m no good ever, 

really. But you, you don’t make me feel like a bad 
person ... I love you. I knew it the minute I met 
you. I’m sorry it took so long for me to catch up. 
I just got stuck.”

That last part was from “Silver Linings 

Playbook,” but Katharine Hepburn never saw 
it ’cause she died in 2003 and everything, so 
she thought I was real romantic and would kiss 
me hard and drop her champagne on the car-
pet, and I’d go to clean it up but she’d be all like, 
“Leave it, dah-ling. We’re wonderful. Hold me 
... mmm.” And I would, tight and all that. And 
we’d sleep together, but never have sex because 
the sex was only implied.

And then, one day, well ... how are the mighty 

fallen.

One day, after buying Katharine Hepburn a 

frock (whatever that is) and after eating snow 
by the Michigan Union, I walked home, put my 
key in the door and heard something — “Oh, 
Cary, put me in your pocket.” I burst in and 
what I saw ... what I saw was ...

In my bed, under my new comforter, was 

Katharine Hepburn kissing my hallucination 
of Hollywood star and honorary Oscar winner 

Cary Grant!

“Cary Grant!” 

I said, dropping 
my package and 
such. 
“What 

are you doing?! 
Shouldn’t you be 
in the Golden Age 
of Hollywood?”

Cary 
Grant 

tightened 
his 

tie, clasped my 
shoulder, 
and 

said, 
“Easy-

old-fellow-just-
passing-through-
on-my-way-
to-New-York. 
Don’t-be-
alarmed. Katha-
rine-and-I-were-just-trading-secrets ... with ... 
our ... tongues.”

I socked him in the nose. But then Cary 

Grant said he deserved it, which made me feel 
bad for socking him because I didn’t want him 
to think he deserved it. I wanted him to hit me 
back. But he didn’t. Katharine Hepburn socked 
me in the nose.

“Terribly-sorry, Al-ex,” Cary Grant said. 

“The-thing-is-I-drank-to-ex-cess. Or-no, life 
... drank ... me.” He was gone before I could ask 
him what the shit that meant.

And then it was just me and Katharine Hep-

burn.

Me: “Did you have to make out with some-

body my mom thinks is hot?”

She: “I’m sorry, but I have no sympathy for 

you. Not everyone is lucky enough to under-
stand how delicious it is to suffer. I’ve made you 
lucky. Do you understand?”

Me: “I understand, but that doesn’t help or 

matter. That never matters, Katharine.”

She: “Yeah ... ”
Me: “God, you were Katharine Hepburn and 

now you’re just Katharine and I wish you were 
still Katharine Hepburn. Or, at least ‘Madam 
Heppo.’ ”

I wiped my nose and adjusted myself. She 

sucked on one of those long cigarette hold-
ers, but there wasn’t a cigarette inside ’cause 
my building doesn’t allow smoking so she just 
sucked on the plastic. God, it was hot.

“I love what I thought we were,” I said.
“Thank you,” she said. “I regret very little. 

And I’ve enjoyed myself immensely.”

“Good,” I said. “I’m ... I’m glad, really.” I 

smiled real small, and she was gone.

I miss Katharine. I even miss Cary Grant. 

My hallucinations, what I thought they were 
for so long, what they still might be. And I keep 
asking myself and only myself — because other 
people might understand but understanding 
isn’t enough — I keep asking: How do I get my 
hallucinations back? And how do I forget that’s 
what they are?

And I always tell myself the same thing: 

Enough with the movies, schmuck. Eat snow.

So I do, I do. I get my coat, I grab my keys, 

and I make a big show of it.

“

You should call your next column the Domes-
tic Life of Sharon, Tanvi, Tanya and Dhara,” 
my roommate, Dhara, said. “Like ‘The Suite 

Life of Zack and Cody,’ but less interesting.”

She’s lugging two trash bags out of our kitchen 

to hand to our other roommate, Sharon, who’s 
standing at the door with a sour expression on her 
face.

“This is the worst part about going home for 

break,” Sharon had said earlier in the day. “Clean-
ing.”

I observe them attempting to wrestle with the 

bags, standing unhelpfully against my bedroom 
door.

Out of all of my roommates, I am the least 

“domestic.” It’s not that I’m untidy or horrifically 
messy, it’s just that I’m not equipped with the same 
level of housekeeping skills as them. 

All three of them can make rice without burning 

it, can prepare Chai that doesn’t look like sewer 
water and spin perfectly round rotis, the ultimate 
quality of Indian femininity.

Rotis, which I can only best describe as Indian 

tortillas, but thinner, and their shape, hold a very 
special place in the judgment of an Indian woman’s 
character. Or, to be more accurate, the archaic 
judgment of an Indian woman’s character.

Round rotis were a prized talent, but mine, 

unfortunately, always turn out to be some abstract 
shape, much to the embarrassment of my mother, 
who has been trying to teach me to cook and clean 
as adeptly as herself ever since I turned thirteen.

“What is wrong with you? What are you going 

to do when you’re living and working alone?” she’d 
always scream at me. “How are you going to take of 
yourself? Who is going to cook for you?”

I would roll my eyes and make up some excuse 

— usually that I had to “study” some more — to 
beg off whatever cooking or cleaning task she had 

assigned me.

Looking back now, as my roommates tidied up 

the apartment and deftly swept the linoleum floor, 
I realize how stupid I had been to ignore my mom’s 
lessons. I am utterly ill equipped to function on 
my own. My version of “cleaning” is just scrubbing 
every surface with Lysol wipes.

When I was younger, I always assumed that 

the reason my mother was assigning cooking and 
cleaning tasks to me was because I was a girl. 
Every time she would yell at me about vacuuming 
the house on a weekly basis or washing off the dish-
es the sink, I would look at my brother lounging on 
the couch unbothered and get angry.

But now, whenever I come home, it’s him doing 

the very tasks that I had been asked to do when I 
was his age. It wasn’t because I was a girl, I now 
realize, but because I was, in my mother’s mind, a 
modern girl. I would eventually be moving away 
from my parents’ home and living on my own, 
something that only happened in my mother’s gen-
eration when a woman was married off.

When my mom was assigned her chores by 

my grandmother, her protests would be met with 
scoldings about her in-laws would receive her lack 
of cooking skills, how she would keep them and 
her husband happy and how she could be expected 
to maintain the respect of her marital home if she 
couldn’t even do basic things like make a four-
course meal alone.

But my mom wouldn’t dare mention any of 

these things to me, simply because she knows that 
they’re not what me or any other girl my age, liv-
ing in this time period in this country, would want 
for themselves. The fact that my roommates have 
picked up these lifelong skills from their own house 
doesn’t meant that they’re too “traditional” or 
“old-fashioned,” it just means that they’re far more 
prepared for the real world than I am.

A 

sign tells guests to remove shoes to avoid tracking snow 
into the house. A chessboard, with all of its pieces intact, 
sits next to a couch. I’m invited to sit in and wait. The 

BYX insignia hangs on the wall, and at the bottom, under an 
intricately designed cross, the words proudly state the house’s 
motto: “Brothers Under Christ.”

This is not your average fraternity house.
With only three on campus currently, Christian fraternities 

and sororities have slowly been growing at the University. They 
are all different, one traditionally old (Phi Alpha Kappa), one 
newer and growing (Beta Upsilon Chi), and the last newly mint-
ed (Sigma Alpha Omega).

Beyond the obvious religious affiliations, these houses differ 

in other noticeable ways from their non-religious counterparts.

The lack of alcohol at events, for instance, marks one of the 

biggest divides between Christian fraternities and sororities 
and most of “normal” Greek life. BYX still hosts dry mixers 
with Pan-Hellenic sororities like Delta Gamma and does joint 
charity events with Gamma Phi Beta. But it lacks the prevailing 
party atmosphere that seems to attract so many new students to 
Greek life in the first place.

The fact that such organizations survive and grow speaks to 

their other offerings — those beyond traditional Greek organi-
zations.

***

There are many assumptions that come with the phrase 

“Christian fraternity/sorority.”

As a Muslim, I entered these houses expecting conversa-

tions about Jesus and piety, things I hadn’t heard since Sunday 
school. This wasn’t exactly the image I came away with.

My initial interview inquiry to PAK was met with the reply, 

“We as a house are very interested.” (This is not the usual 
response I get to an interview request.) Getting the brand out 
there, it turns out, is very important for them.

At PAK, I’m seated at an impeccably clean roundtable with 

four brothers across from me. The living room to the right of 
me is also impeccably clean, and the small den in front of me 
is, incredibly, impeccably clean. I didn’t go upstairs, but I could 
guess: impeccable.

“We try to really strive to encourage involvement in the 

house,” Engineering senior Ryan Wawrzaszek said. 

The fraternity originated at Calvin College in Grand Rap-

ids in 1929. Eventually, the organization moved to Ann Arbor, 
where it is now based in a considerably large house on East Ann 
Street.

Surprisingly, original links still survive. The group has elev-

en active members and a number of pledges, and all of them are 
connected to either Calvin College or Grand Rapids, PAK Presi-
dent John Swets said. New members join through connections, 
not general interest.

“To me, the house is a living, dynamic, breathing thing,” 

Swets said. “It remains a group of guys that are founded in the 
same core beliefs.”

The halls of the house are adorned with class pictures from 

each year dating back to 1929, filling in a long history of lineage 
and tradition. It retains a somewhat medieval and traditional 
aura. The brothers say this setting is integral to how they func-
tion and interact with one another.

Wawrzaszek tells me about the time he stumbled upon a con-

versation in the hallway about a certain scripture, and ended up 
spending many hours into the night standing there discussing, 
laughing.

“Religion, for whatever reason, has become one of those top-

ics that you don’t broach with someone that you don’t know that 
well, and I think that’s kind of sad,” Warzaszek says. “It’s some-
thing that our culture kind of stigmatizes, but just sharing on 
that deep of a level just brings you closer to people.”

This sentiment is easily noticed in conversations with these 

fraternity and sorority members. They speak so casually about 
faith and religion that it sometimes catches me off-guard.

PAK has a student chaplain, Matthew Rouhana, who orga-

nizes events for the fraternity. He notes that his main, day-
to-day duty is simply leaving his door open and talking to any 
brother who needs a chat.

“If you can see that someone’s missing some kind of aspect in 

their spiritual life, you try to start up some event to kind of see 
what that is,” said Rouhana, who wears a long, visible wooden 
cross around his neck.

The fraternity holds a weekly “Praise and Worship Night,” 

but they also plan more casual events, such as a Whirlyball 
night. They shovel snow up and down their road as an act of 
good faith toward their neighbors. The Christian part is impor-
tant, yes, but it’s not all-consuming.

Their relationship with alcohol is a little different. Swets, the 

president, admits to me, a little sheepishly, that their fraternity 
is not technically dry. At their annual Casino Night party, they 
do, in fact, have a cocktail bar, but the majority of their events 
do not feature alcohol.

Rouhana adds on that he believes the current culture of 

going out and partying is “kind of self-indulgent and inwardly 
focused.”

“We try to show that you can have fun without having an 

excess,” Swets said. “You don’t have to be drunk off your mind 
to have a good time, so we want to emphasize the human inter-
actions with people, and I think it’s more genuine when you can 
do that in an environment where the focus isn’t alcohol.”

LSA junior Julia Hopkins is one of the founders of Sigma 

Alpha Omega, the University’s only Christian sorority. Only in 
its second active semester, SAO was founded as a response to 
the lack of a Christian sisterhood while two fraternities existed. 
As Hopkins puts it, the founders felt it was “God’s calling.”

“We’re all at different places in our spiritual walks, so that’s 

what ties us all together,” she said.

SAO is small, and it doesn’t yet have a house. Nationally, they 

don’t own property either.

Like PAK, SAO is a predominantly white organization. But 

Hopkins says this is a result of their size and the pool of stu-
dents from which they can recruit.

“It’s a hard topic to deal with, because we’re already catering 

to such a small population of people that would be interested,” 
Hopkins said.

Hopkins says the group does not define itself by religious 

standards, but that faith informs many aspects of what it does.

The sorority members open and close their chapter meetings 

with prayers. Many come from separate churches around Ann 
Arbor and separate denominations entirely, but they all come 
together for the same Bible study nights.

Their social events include apple-picking and wood-carving, 

and community service with churches and other organizations 
is one of their main activities. And, like its fraternal counter-
parts, the sorority is completely dry.

Hopkins, though, wants to clear things up.
“I’m not against alcohol,” she said. “I really want that sister-

hood, but I don’t like to drink or party.”

Hopkins says their sorority is not allowed to have alcohol at 

its events. As she puts it, Christians sometimes carry a reputa-
tion for being “very goody two-shoes and strict,” but she’s quick 
to note that they have a lot of fun.

“We’ve found that we can still have fun, but not play with 

fire, so to speak,” she said.

***

BYX is a relatively new fraternity. It is nationally recognized, 

but this is only its fourth active semester at the University.

LSA senior Wesley Cimmarrusti says because his fraternity 

is dry, they have a different turnout than Greek life parties. He 

tells me, though, that when BYX invites sororities to its dry 
mixers, the recipients of the invitations often reply that they 
would be thrilled to join. And a recent Halloween party, he says, 
was “like a rave,” with black lights and music and all the thrills 
of a normal party.

“Instead of simply removing drinking from the equation, we 

kind of fill it with other things,” he said.

Cimmarrusti, much like the representatives from the other 

two organizations, is eager to confirm that they’re not some 
holier-than-thou group of people with weird parties. Christian-
ity isn’t the dominant aspect of their social life.

“Hopefully, everything we’re doing is God-honoring in one 

way or another, but it’s definitely not like at our parties only 
Christian music is played, or people are taking Communion as 
they walk through the door,” he said.

PAK, BYX and SAO all mention their commitment to rela-

tionships quite often, and how their organizations are struc-
tured to favor close bonds and lasting friendships over alcohol 
and parties. At both BYX and PAK, pledges are required to 
interview each brother as a part of pledging, a common practice 
in many fraternities.

It is, however, tough to recruit as a Christian fraternity.
SAO, which currently has only six active members, meets 

with prospective candidates and votes on each one.

“We rarely turn people away,” Hopkins said.

***

I was once a wide-eyed freshman, and while I always knew 

Greek life wasn’t meant for people like me, it will always be 
something that is still more attractive and enticing than I want 
it to be in my head — loud, boisterous tailgates sounded much 
more fun than spontaneous community service events. For 
those in the latter camp, however, service is something Chris-
tian fraternities and sororities “love to do,” says Cimmarrusti.

And community outreach is integral to the appeal of such 

fraternities and sororities. This is BYX’s first semester in their 
house on North Ingalls Street, after its past tenants, members of 
a fraternity known as “Sig,” were kicked out by the landlord for 
“destroying the house every year,” Cimmarrusti said.

After such experiences, the landlord personally approached 

BYX to take over the lease. 

“There wasn’t a ton of love from the neighbors initially,” 

Cimmarrusti said, referencing the reputation the previous fra-
ternity had garnered in the neighborhood.

BYX baked cookies for the neighbors and performed Rake-

and-Runs, which are, as they sound, simply unfathomably nice 
versions of ding-dong ditching.

In return, the fraternity has started to receive some posi-

tive feedback from the community. Cimmarrusti makes sure to 
mention, however, that outreach is simply a part of their fra-
ternal contract, and not something that’s done with an agenda.

***

After my hour-long chat with brothers of PAK, they all 

thanked me, humbly and graciously, and asked me about my 
religious background, humbly and respectfully. I responded 
that I’m Muslim, and for a fleeting moment, I began to lament 
the lack of a “Muslim fraternity.” I like to think a small part of 
them did, too.

At the end of my conversation with Julia, she simply wanted 

to mention the obvious: “We’re normal.”

And near the end of my interview with Wesley, a brother 

came down to the dining hall and dropped off his jacket.

“What event are you most excited for next semester, Ed?” 

Cimmarrusti asked, trying to add some closing thoughts to the 
proceedings.

Ed paused, then admitted, “There’s a mixer with Delta 

Gamma that I’m super excited about.”

“Is there a girl you got your eye on?”

University reacts to surging specialty drug prices

by Irene Park, Daily Staff Reporter

T

he University’s prescription drug 
plan currently supports more than 
100,000 beneficiaries, including 

faculty, staff and retirees. And the price 
has been climbing, increasing about 11 
percent in 2014 and about 17 percent in 
2015. 

Keith Bruhnsen, manager of the 

University’s prescription drug plan, said 
the increase in the cost reflects multiple 
factors, such as inflation, increased new 
products and utilization.

This rise, however, rests close to the 

national average, which was 13.1 percent 
in 2014, evidence of the impact that 
national trends in drug pricing can have 
on a regional level.

Among 
these 
factors, 
Bruhnsen 

pointed to specialty drugs as those most 
responsible for the rise in the cost. The 
cost of specialty drugs for University’s 
drug plan rose more than 37 percent in 
2015.

Specialty drugs are ones designed to 

treat complex and chronic conditions. One 
specialty drug, Sovaldi, treats hepatitis C 
and cures more than 90 percent of those 
who are treated with it. But the 12-week 
course treatment costs $84,000 in the 
United States, averaging to about $1,000 
a pill.

Sovaldi is just one example, however.

Daraprim: A case study

Earlier this year, controversy over the 

anti-parasite drug Daraprim prompted 
political proposals from 2016 presidential 
candidates like Hillary Clinton and 
Bernie Sanders, and debate over the 
current healthcare system and antitrust 
laws.

In September, Martin Shkreli, the 

CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, which 
acquired the rights to Daparim for $55 
million, raised the price of the drug from 
$13.50 to $750 a tablet overnight — a 
5,500-percent increase.

Daraprim is an FDA-approved drug 

used 
to treat toxoplasmosis, a disease 

resulting 
from 
parasitic 
infections 

that can cause serious complications 
for 
immune-compromised 
patients, 

such as those who have gone through 
chemotherapy or have AIDS, pregnant 
women 
and 
children. 
According 

to Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, toxoplasmosis is a leading 

cause of death from foodborne illnesses.

Unlike many medications like allergy 

or heartburn medicine, there are no 
generic alternatives for Daraprim. When 
the drug’s patent expires — usually 20 
years after filing — other companies 
can produce the generic version using 
the same active ingredient found in the 
original drug.

Since Daraprim first came to market 

in 1953, its patent has long expired. But 
Daraprim is not widely used — only 
8,000 to 12,000 prescriptions in the 
United States each year compared to 
25 million for statins, drugs that lower 
cholesterol — and it is unattractive for 
new pharmaceutical companies to invest 
in developing a generic drug because it 
may not be as profitable as investing in a 
bigger market.

Robert Winfield, chief health officer 

and director of University Health Service, 
said this creates no competition in smaller 
markets for companies like Turing 
Pharmaceuticals, allowing the companies 
to set the price “as high as the market will 
bear” while abiding to the law.

He saw an opportunity to take 

advantage to make profit, added Public 
Health Prof. Richard Hirth. He also said 
unfortunately there is not much that can 
be done under the current regulations, but 
implementing changes to help companies 
pursue generic drug research can help 
create competitions to prevent such 
exploitations in the future.

“(Shkreli) 
realized 
there 
is 
an 

opportunity to be exploited,” Hirth said. 
“There really isn’t a lot that can be done 
under the current regulations.”

Marianne 
Udow-Phillips, 
director 

of the Center for Healthcare Research 
& Transformation, said raising prices 
of drugs like Daraprim probably will 
not cause a significant increase in the 
healthcare cost by itself because of the 
small market, and that is how many 
companies like Turing Pharmaceuticals 
get away with an exorbitant price.

However, Udow-Phillips added that 

this controversy has brought the issue to 
Congress, generating discussions.

“(The 
controversy) 
has 
brought 

considerable 
federal 
scrutiny 
and 

discussions in Congress whether there 
should be more price controls and limits 

for older drugs with expired patent,” 
Udow-Phillips said.

Amid 
the 
controversy, 
Shkreli 

appeared on multiple news platforms and 
was active on social media to explain his 
actions. On CBS News, he said the price 
raise was to generate reasonable, not 
excessive, amount of profit.

Shkreli furthermore said the higher 

profit earned from the price raise could 
help with developing a new drug to treat 
toxoplasmosis.

Erik 
Gordon, 
clinical 
assistant 

professor of business, questioned why 
Turing 
Pharmaceuticals 
should 
be 

“rewarded” with the profit since the 
company was not involved with the initial 
research and development of Daraprim.

Gordon said drug companies that 

actually do the high-risk drug research 
should 
be 
rewarded, 
but 
Turing 

Pharmaceuticals 
and 
other 
similar 

companies are not “entitled” to them. 
One 
such 
company 
called 
Valeant 

Pharmaceuticals also raised price for its 
cancer-related dermatology drug by about 
1700 percent over the last six years. 

“If we don’t let (companies that do 

high-risk research) make enough money, 
they can’t keep doing the research,” 
Gordon said.

Hirth noted, however, that Shkreli’s 

statement about using Daraprim’s profits 
toward new drug research had little 
credibility, as Turing Pharmaceuticals 
is not a research company, and Shkreli 
has little background in pharmaceutical 
research (he is a hedge fund manager).

Last week, Turing Pharmaceuticals 

announced that the company would 
offer a 50 percent discount on Daraprim 
for hospitals, bringing down the cost 
to $375 per tablet. The company also 
announced that it would provide the 
drug free of charge for uninsured, low-
income patients, contribute to Patient 
Services Inc., a charity that financially 
assists Medicare patients, and participate 
in federal and state drug price discount 
programs.

In a statement, Nancy Retzlaff, the 

company’s 
chief 
commercial 
officer, 

attempted to easy the concerns of some 
patients: “We pledge that no patient 
needing Daraprim will ever be denied 
access.”

Personal Statement: A year ago I got friend-dumped

by Cheryll Victuelles, Statement Creative Director

H

ello friends, I’m home! Let me know if/when 
you have time to get together before Sunday! — 
November 26, 2014, 3:23 p.m.

***

Going home used to be exciting for me. That changed 

about this time a year ago.

I was home in Illinois for Thanksgiving break, eager to 

see my friends from high school. I was the only one who 
left the state for college, and having spent the summer in 
Ann Arbor, it had been a while since we were all together. 
That weekend was especially important because my best 
friend, who I had known since I was seven and shared a 
(self-appointed) couple name with, was turning twenty-
one.

I texted our group on Wednesday, asking if anyone was 

free before I had to go back to school.

No response.
When I asked again later if we were doing anything 

for my best friend’s birthday, worried that I hadn’t heard 
about any plans yet, I was told we’d be maintaining our 
tradition of going to our town’s tree lighting ceremony 
the night after Thanksgiving and going back to one of our 
houses to watch a Christmas movie. This seemed a little 
off to me, but I went with it, figuring that very few of my 
friends were big partiers.

Friday night, she got up to leave after “Christmas 

Vacation” ended, and I went in for a hug. Still no mention 
of real birthday plans. I asked, “Am I going to see you 
again before I leave?” She gave me a small smile: “I don’t 
know.”

I spent the next day at home with my cousin. At some 

point I checked Snapchat as a distraction from whatever 
assignment I was only kind of trying to do. I was going 
through the motions of tapping on each story to get that 
stupid little plus sign to go away when I saw it: they were 
all together, celebrating her birthday — without me. I 
turned to Facebook for confirmation. Photos of her and 
my other friends captioned “Happy birthday!” mocked 
me from my computer screen.

I watched the stories again. I could feel my throat 

closing with each tap. Maybe those other girls I don’t 

know in the picture planned it and didn’t know about me. 
My stomach dropped. Tap. That doesn’t make sense, then 
why would the others be there? Tap. They wouldn’t know 
them either. Tears began to form in the corners of my eyes 
when I finally processed it all. Tap.

I’m not supposed to be there.
I rushed to the bathroom to save face in front of my 

cousin. I knew I couldn’t be in there for too long, so I let 
the initial sobs come out, took a few deep breaths, and 
splashed my face with some cold water.

Apparently I wasn’t very convincing. When I came 

back out, he asked if everything was okay. Usually I lie, 
but that night I no longer had the heart. We drove around 
just to get my mind off things. Later that night, I decided 
to take the initiative and text my friends about how hurt 
I was. No immediate response. For the next few hours, 
my eyes would dart to my phone at each ghost vibration. 
There was still nothing when it came time for me to go 
to bed.

Halfway through my drive back to Ann Arbor, my 

phone buzzed. A glance at the screen told me it was her. 
My heart skipped a beat. I anticipated the worst and 
feared my own reaction if I decided to pull over and read 
it. I had two more hours before I could look at what she 
said. I sang along louder to each song to distract myself.

My gut feeling was right. The gist: she felt like our 

friendship had been over for a while already. Her birthday 
party was her idea. As we progressed through our college 
years, it seemed like I only contacted her when something 
was going wrong and that our interests were too different.

I gave myself three reads before it really sunk in.
I texted her back with a desperate apology and a plea 

that we try to fix things. She responded that now wasn’t a 
good time — she had a lot going on. Crying, I slunk to the 
floor and frantically texted my next closest friend from 
home.

She didn’t want to talk about it, but she made a point 

in telling me that it felt like I only wanted to be her friend 
when I was in town. That’s when everything started to 
piece together: the unanswered texts, the “we’ve been 
really busy” responses I’d get when I’d ask how everyone 

was, the feeling that celebrating 21 at the town’s tree 
lighting ceremony wasn’t quite right, the fact that no 
one could look me in the eye when I’d ask about birthday 
plans. They’d been keeping me in the dark for months, 
secretly resenting me.

As I sat crumpled on the floor of my bedroom, their 

accusations ran through my mind. Were they right? 
Have I really been that selfish? Did I change for the 
worse over the years? A mix of defeat and indignation 
took over. I guess I do only text when I’m coming home, 
and I only have been telling her about my mishaps. But 
texting can go both ways! And most of those stories 
were funny! Shouldn’t you be able to turn to your best 
friend in times of need anyway? These questions and 
answers replayed in my head for months. I couldn’t 
fathom how they could have felt that way for so long 
without saying anything. I scrutinized every inch of 
the past, experiencing each stage of grief until I finally 
reached acceptance.

I had never been more thankful that I was living in my 

sorority house before then, because you know love after a 
hallway of girls drops everything to see you stop crying. 
And that’s what I realized as time wore on. I realized it 
when my cousin drove me around after the initial shock. I 
realized it when my best friend in Ann Arbor let me come 
over that night, cry on her couch, eat ice cream for dinner 
and watch an awful romantic comedy on a Sunday night 
even though we both had a break’s worth of homework to 
do. I realized it when my parents, whom I rarely speak to 
about my personal life, called me that night because they 
knew something was wrong. I am still loved.

***

Going home doesn’t feel like it used to. I still hesitate to 

get in touch with my other friends for fear that someone 
else will end things. Our group never talked about what 
happened, at least not with me, and when we have big 
gatherings, she and I are nothing more than awkward, 
polite strangers. I still walk on eggshells for fear I’ll be 
told again that I’ve changed.

The thing is I have changed. I just no longer feel guilty 

about it.

On Nov. 16 Angel Haze, a 23-year-old rapper from Detroit, returned to their hometown 

and performed their latest project “Back To The Woods” in the neighboring city of 
Ferndale at The Loving Touch. Haze identifies as agender and prefers gender-neutral 
pronouns. The show began with performances with some of Haze’s favorite Detroit 
artists, Mic Write and Detroit Che. Starting with the track “New York”: but changing 
the verse to “I run Detroit,” Haze set up the remainder of the night to be catharsis of 
their homecoming; they and the crowd jumped with city pride. Haze connected with 
the audience from serenading women to tears in “Babe Ruthless,” to rapping about their 
experience about being Black in America “Impossible.” They ended the night with “Battle 
Cry” and encouraged fellow Detroiters to love their city, but go out and see the rest of the 
world.
