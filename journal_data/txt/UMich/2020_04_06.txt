On Friday, March 13, two days 

after the University of Michigan 

canceled in-person classes and 

moved to online instruction for the 

rest of the semester, Kathy Roos, 

the owner of RoosRoast Coffee 

on East Liberty Street, removed 

half of the chairs from the cafe’s 

seating area. The change was 

meant to promote social distancing 

— a phrase that has, in the past few 

weeks, come to epitomize the self-

isolation needed to slow the spread 

of the rapidly growing COVID-19 

pandemic.

“We were ahead of the game,” 

Roos said. “We did that because 

we were very aware of what was 

happening.”

Now, 
with 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer’s Stay Home, Stay Safe 

Executive Order mandating the 

closure 
of 
all 
“non-essential 

businesses,” RoosRoast remains 

reliant on a curbside to-go business 

operating out of their Rosewood 

Street location. Even with these 

kinds of services, Roos said she 

is not sure Ann Arbor’s small 

businesses will survive prolonged 

shutdowns. 

“This could destroy the local 

economy,” Roos said. “That’s a 

really strong word. But when 

is this going to end? How long 

can businesses remain closed? 

And all the amazing, deep local, 

idiosyncratic 
Ann 
Arbor 
local 

businesses — they can’t survive. 

They’re not going to be able to 

survive being closed for too long.”

The coronavirus pandemic hit 

when rising rent prices and an 

increase in development across 

the city were already putting a 

strain on local businesses. In 2018, 

18 businesses closed, with most 

closures affecting businesses that 

had been open for more than 25 

years. Rent prices also soared in the 

past year, leaving business owners 

struggling to pay their employees 

at rates that would allow them to 

reside within city limits. 

But the pandemic and subsequent 

executive orders have placed local 

businesses in a unique situation, 

leaving many to rely on community 

support in order to meet their rent 

and pay employees. 

Literati 
Bookstore, 
a 
staple 

bookshop on East Washington 

Street, raised more than $115,000 

through a GoFundMe campaign 

last month. Literati’s owners, Mike 

and Hilary Gustafson, met their 

goal of $100,000 just days after the 

fundraiser opened on March 23. 

Many stores and restaurants have 

followed suit, hoping community 

donations will be able to sustain 

their businesses until the pandemic 

subsides and the city reopens.

On March 16, the day the 

University of Michigan officially 

began online classes in response to 

the novel coronavirus outbreak, a 

student, who will be referred to in 

this article as Jane, had two exams. 

One of her exams was canceled 

while the other was open for three 

days to accommodate students’ 

schedules. 

According to Jane, one of her 

friends asked for her assistance in 

taking the exam. Jane has requested 

anonymity for fear of retaliation 

from the University. To protect 

Jane from retaliation, The Daily has 

decided not to publish the name of 

the course.

 Jane said she agreed to help her 

friend cheat by taking her friend’s 

exam, but she said she took her own 

exam separately.

“I helped somebody take their 

exam, and then I took mine because 

there’s no browser lock or anything 

(and) they’re not using the camera,” 

Jane said. “I did that, so then I knew 

what was on it.” 

Jane said she did not think the 

exam was that difficult but did 

believe helping her friend made 

her more prepared. After taking 

the exam, Jane said she was really 

nervous 
about 
getting 
caught. 

However, once she talked to more 

people, she said she realized many 

others had also used some form of 

assistance on their exam.

“I was talking to my friends 

after … and they were like, ‘If (the 

instructional team) checks if people 

open the textbook, if they enforce 

that, then the average score would 

be zero because everyone is going to 

do it,’” Jane said.

The 49th annual Hash Bash, 

Ann Arbor’s annual cannabis 

rights 
event, 
took 
place 

online Saturday afternoon via 

livestream due to the state of 

Michigan’s stay-at-home order 

amid the coronavirus outbreak. 

Michigan’s statewide COVID-

19 cases surpassed 14,000 by 

Saturday. Nick Zettell, co-founder 

of MI Legalize and leader of 

the Hash Bash Committee, said 

the group quickly searched for 

alternative platforms to host the 

event as the spread of the virus 

increased in the past few weeks.

Kevin Leeser bags 3D-printed medical face shield components donated to Operation Face Shield, the organization he created in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

Information 
sophomore 
Summer 

Nguyen was scrolling through Facebook 

one day in late March when she came 

across another GoFundMe page for 

a small Ann Arbor business. Nguyen, 

realizing the serious implications of 

Whitmer’s executive order for local 

businesses, decided to create a post 

with the links of multiple GoFundMe 

campaigns to spread awareness about the 

calls for donations.

“I realized that there are so many 

more small and local businesses that I 

care about in Ann Arbor that may not be 

seen,” Nguyen said. “It’s kind of hard to 

pinpoint which ones are actually accepting 

donations and are in need of support right 

now. So I thought it would be a good idea 

to just compile the ones that I could find in 

the local downtown Ann Arbor area that 

people knew about and would be willing to 

support.”

Nguyen said stay-at-home orders and 

citywide shutdowns have led students and 

community members to feel powerless 

in the face of a looming economic crisis. 

Turning to fundraising platforms, she said, 

may be one of the only ways to actively 

contribute. 

“It can be kind of a helpless situation,” 

Nguyen said. “There’s not much that we 

can really do since we’re all quarantined 

inside our homes. By donating, I feel like 

it’s one of the best ways to kind of fight 

back and provide a good contribution to 

this entire thing.”

Jessie Lipkowitz, the owner of aUM 

Yoga on South University Avenue and a 

University alum, echoed this feeling of 

helplessness after being forced to shut her 

business’ doors late last month. In an email 

to The Daily, Lipkowitz said business may 

not return to normal even if the studio was 

granted permission to reopen. 

“Even if we were able to re-open 

our doors tomorrow, the University of 

Michigan has cancelled spring term 

classes, and the months of May-August are 

already a gigantic hurdle that Ann Arbor 

businesses face every year,” Lipkowitz 

wrote. “The ripple effects of this pandemic 

will continue for months, if not for years to 

come.”

Like the Gustafsons, Lipkowitz turned 

to GoFundMe in an attempt to preserve 

her business, which opened on North 

University Avenue in September 2013 and 

expanded to a new space in 2015. She said 

she remains thankful for the community’s 

support even as she struggles to keep the 

business operational in preparation for its 

reopening. 

“It is hard to put into words how much 

gratitude we have, knowing that members 

of our community are willing to contribute 

in a time that is undoubtedly difficult for 

everyone,” Lipkowtiz wrote. 

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor 

said the city has been implementing small 

initiatives to help small businesses feeling 

the impact of COVID-19, such as making 

parking in Ann Arbor free. This allows 

individuals to more easily pick up take-out 

meals and conveniently park outside of 

restaurants, Taylor said.

“The market impact of COVID-19 is 

substantial and continues to spread,” 

Taylor said. “As primarily a municipal 

service-providing organization, we don’t 

have resources to provide grants and 

things like that to enterprises. We do have 

some levers that we’re working on.”

Taylor said most small businesses in 

Ann Arbor are on triple net leases by which 

tenants have property tax responsibility. 

He said the city will continue to provide 

services such as water supply, police 

stations and fire stations during the 

pandemic.

According to the LSA website on 

academic 
misconduct, 
“Academic 

dishonesty may be understood as any 

action or attempted action that may 

result in creating an unfair academic 

advantage for oneself or an unfair 

academic advantage or disadvantage 

for any other member or members of 

the academic community.” 

Examples of academic misconduct 

include 
cheating, 
plagiarism 
and 

unacceptable 
collaboration. 
The 

website also lists among other forms 

of misconduct “aiding and abetting 

dishonesty,” 
or 
when 
students 

deliberately or inadvertently provide 

material or information to another 

person that allows for improper use.

Though the students interviewed by 

The Daily mentioned their concerns 

regarding an increase in cheating 

in the digital classroom, The Daily 

cannot verify the extent to which 

cheating is currently occurring. 

In Said Hannouchi’s Arabic 402 

class, Hannouchi, the Arabic language 

program director, said he shares his 

screen during in-class live quizzes 

to avoid having copies spread out 

and shared with students between 

class sections. He also said sharing 

the screen restricts students from 

consulting 
other 
resources 
while 

taking quizzes.

“I share the screen instead of 

sending them the quiz,” Hannouchi 

said. “They only had to write the 

answers. If they want to go back and 

look at something, they only have 

the answers. They don’t have full 

sentences or the prompts that are 

given to them.” 

However, Hannouchi said he trusts 

his students and said he only wants to 

mirror in-class conditions.

“I know my students,” Hannouchi 

said. “I’m not worried, actually. When 

I did that, I’m not worried about 

cheating. (I’m just) trying to simulate 

what we’re doing in the class.”

Prior to the move towards online 

learning, procedures for resolving 

academic misconduct usually began 

with instructors reporting possible 

violations to the Office of the Assistant 

Dean and informing the student. 

Though instructors may choose to 

handle simple cases on their own, 

the OAD requests a summary to be 

reported after the conclusion of the 

incident and for complex cases to be 

immediately reported. 

The 
OAD 
then 
begins 
an 

investigation and meets with the 

student, where an Honor Council 

representative may attend. The LSA 

Student Honor Council is a student 

organization that promotes integrity 

on campus and provides a student voice 

at academic misconduct hearings. 

Next, the OAD determines the 

outcome and reports to the student 

and instructor. If the student is found 

responsible, the student may have 

college sanctions imposed and will 

have appropriate grade penalties as 

outlined in the course syllabus. If the 

student is found not responsible, the 

instructor should grade the student 

regularly 
and 
no 
sanctions 
are 

imposed.

It is during times like this, 

when normalcy escapes us and 

uncertainty consumes us, that 

what defines us becomes clear. Our 

identities as Wolverines no longer 

hinge on the routines we had on 

campus, but rather on the integral 

parts of our identity which allow 

us to claim ownership over the 

title “leaders and best.” Through 

our resilience, leadership, and 

connectedness, we are able to feel 

like a Wolverine during a time 

where being a Wolverine looks 

entirely different than before. 

Engineering 
junior 
Bashar 

Hallak, Baalbek, Lebanon native, 

described his transition to online 

classes as, “less busy with life in 

general and having more time to 

think about others.” 

He worries about how the 

already disadvantaged people of 

his hometown would survive the 

pandemic. The current crippling 

position of Baalbek, void of basic 

necessities, was detailed to him 

by his relatives and friends back 

home, and inspired Hallak to 

launch a charity campaign to 

support his people.

“I was thinking about the 

people of my town last week: what 

are they doing now, how are they 

surviving this pandemic, they 

are already underprivileged and 

most of them don’t have jobs,” 

Hallak said. “Even my friends 

that have degrees back home can’t 

find jobs because the country is 

doing very bad economically. So 

... I called my dad and asked him 

what the situation in Baalbek 

is: the situation here is very bad 

Baba, people literally have nothing 

to eat, and no money to support 

themselves’”

Within less than 24 hours of 

the campaign launching, over 

200 people shared the campaign 

with others, not only spreading 

awareness 
of 
the 
people 
of 

Baalbek’s 
struggles, 
but 
also 

spreading 
empathy. 
Halak’s 

campaign has successfully raised 

over $2,400 that will be donated 

to Safe Side, a nonprofit that 

distributes food to 

disadvantaged 

families in Baalbek. 

Concerned 
by 

the effect COVID-

19 
will 
have 
on 

small 
businesses 

in Ann Arbor, the 

new 
members 
of 

Delta Sigma Pi-Xi, a 

business fraternity, 

started a Go-Fund-

Me in support of 

local 
businesses 

in Ann Arbor. DSP 

plans to donate the 

money to businesses 

ranging 
from 
the 

Ozone 
House, 
a 

nonprofit 
that 

provides shelter and 

support to homeless 

youth, to Rays Red 

Hots, 
a 
popular 

dining 
spot 
for 

Wolverines, aiming, “to support 

the organizations and people that 

have given life to the place we 

love so much.” Already raising 

over $600, DSP plans to continue 

pushing their campaign until we 

return to school. 

LSA senior Clara Munkarah 

spent a few of her final moments as 

a Wolverine organizing a charity 

virtual cup pong tournament in 

which over 25 Wolverines are 

participating in. The winner of the 

virtual cup pong tournament will 

choose where the participants’ 

donated money to the tournament 

will go. 

“Honestly I just felt pretty 

helpless being stuck at home and 

recognizing how many hardships 

so many people are going through 

right now,” Munkarah said. “So 

I figured, why not combine the 

two and make something fun and 

useful out of it? It wasn’t about 

how many people signed up or 

how much money was raised, if we 

could just unite a few friends and 

donate money to help someone, it 

would make quarantine feel worth 

it.” 

Munkarah’s tournament is a 

small example of the importance 

of holding onto our connectedness 

during these unprecedented times. 

In an attempt to write this 

piece, I reached out to various 

groups on campus asking if they 

were doing inspiring work or felt 

inspired by the works of others. 

I was overwhelmed by the many 

responses I received of students 

volunteering to get groceries for 

the elderly, packaging food for 

low income families, collecting 

donations for local businesses in 

their area, and taking the time to 

handwrite letters to elderly people 

who are isolated from others. With 

each message I received, I felt 

more assured that when we return 

to school our campus will be more 

resilient than ever, and that there 

is incredible meaning behind the 

phrase, “the Michigan difference.”

The Michigan Difference

MAYA KADOUH

MiC Columnist

‘Guide Me, Said 

the Grapevine’

UNSPLASH 

“Either write something worth 

reading or do something worth 

writing.” A friend gifted me a 

brown leather journal with this 

quote on the cover in eighth grade. 

Today, I am left with a large 

collection of journals accumulated 

over the years, halfway filled with 

week-long, month-long, sometimes 

year-long intervals in between. 

Mirroring this is the stack of books 

on my bookshelf, sadly abandoned 

and promised a return.To my 

defense, I do think my memories 

were worth writing down— they 

just got lost in the promise of 

tomorrow.

Despite 
my 
inconsistency, 

writing gave me the opportunity 

to look back at previous seasons of 

life and compare them with seasons 

I am in now, laugh at my angsty 

teenage self and relate to who I was 

many moons ago. So now, trying to 

find the inspiration and attention 

span to pen my thoughts down 

again, I flip through my most recent 

journal, stumbling upon the “List 

of things I learned in 2019” I wrote 

on New Year’s Eve. Number six on 

the list catches my eye: Don’t be 

afraid to go out and take risks, take 

airplanes, take propositions. But 

also don’t be afraid to stay. Don’t be 

afraid to slow down once in a while. 

You’re not missing out on anything.

The advice of my former self 

rings true now more than ever. 

Throughout my three years at 

college, I had rushed to make the 

most out of the time I knew would 

come to an end too soon. I joined 

every organization that sparked 

my interest. I worked three jobs at 

once. I filled up every summer with 

a study abroad trip, jam-packed 

with side trips in between until my 

exhaustion overpowered my thirst 

for sight-seeing. And when I wasn’t 

doing something, I was stressing 

and planning for the next phase in 

my life, the next summer where I 

would need another internship or 

job to keep me busy and productive. 

That’s why, in the beginning of 

the winter semester, I suffered the 

inevitable burnout that I’d always 

heard of but never thought would 

happen to me. I was crippled with 

doubts and fears about where I 

was in life. I wanted so badly to be 

proactive, to be avidly internship-

searching and applying to every 

study abroad and job I could think 

of, but the stress of school and my 

responsibilities finally caught up to 

me, and I quite literally couldn’t. As 

adventure-hungry as I was, I found 

myself fantasizing about a summer 

at home, like my high school 

summers, where I spent time with 

my family and my friends just being 

myself. I fantasized about feeling 

free, unrestricted by the need to 

constantly be doing something. 

To not feel like I was constantly 

missing 
out 
on 
something. 

Nevertheless, I forced myself to 

polish up my resume and apply to 

travel programs and internships, 

telling myself whatever happens, 

happens. After all, we’ve been 

trained not to feel satisfied with 

anything less than over-exertion.

Looking back to my journal entry 

from New Year’s Eve, I now see 

that I was making room for what 

has become my reality. The current 

state of our world has put a halt 

on our futures, and as a result we 

have been forced to look inward or 

backward. Hindsight has been my 

mode of thinking as of late — trying 

to remember who I was before I 

defined my self worth by checklists 

and grades, gym days and meetings, 

how thin I could stretch myself 

before 
I 
collapsed. 
I’ve 
been 

looking 
through 
old 
journals. 

Looking through old photographs. 

Looking through my camera roll 

and smiling at the silly memories 

I’ve made with my friends over the 

past year and letting that replace 

the void now left by lack of social 

interaction. Making up for lost 

time with my family, catching up 

on their lives that I have been out 

of touch with while being so caught 

up in my own. 

The point of this is not to say 

everyone 
should 
be 
having 
a 

transformative, 
self-reflective 

personal journey at this time. That 

is not feasible for everyone. Many 

of us are living in fear for ourselves, 

our loved ones, our futures, our 

world. But I do think there is some 

magic in the whole world being put 

on pause and for once living in the 

same moment, the future uncertain. 

The productivity-obsessed, grind-

at-all-costs culture of our society 

has 
been 
disrupted. 
There 
is 

some bittersweet magic in just 

hoping, waiting, praying, together. 

Remembering the common thread 

of humanity that we have severed 

over the years. Maybe I’ll grab one 

of those unfinished journals and 

pick up where I left off. Maybe we’ll 

come out of this better than where 

we left off.

‘On Slowing Down’


T

hough 
COVID-19 
started 

as a public health issue, 

in the past month it has 

transformed into an economic one 

as well. Lawmakers must act now to 

protect both the health and economic 

well-being of workers, especially 

women. Typical gender roles leave 

women at a disproportionate risk 

during 
this 
crisis, 
exasperating 

existing 
economic, 
medical 
and 

social gender gaps. 

Women’s roles in the workforce 

place them at a greater risk of 

contracting the virus. According 

to the World Health Organization, 

women make up 67 percent of the 

world’s healthcare workforce in 104 

countries, and in the United States, 

that number is 78 percent. Health 

care 
workers, 
especially 
nurses, 

nurse 
practitioners 
and 
medical 

assistants who are on the front lines 

of virus response, are highly exposed 

to the disease itself and in close 

proximity to other people. During the 

2002 SARS (severe acute respiratory 

syndrome) epidemic, more than half 

of the cases worldwide were women 

and 21 percent were health care 

workers. 

The high proportion of women in 

temporary and insecure positions 

also 
places 
them 
at 
a 
greater 

economic and medical disadvantage. 

Women are twice as likely as men 

to be employed part-time. In 2016, 

women made up 63.9 percent of 

the 
part-time 
workforce. 
Part-

time workers are less likely to have 

employee benefits including paid 

family and sick leave and health 

insurance. These workers are also 

the first to be slashed during times of 

economic vulnerability, leaving many 

women without a steady income. The 

Families First Coronavirus Response 

Act passed on March 18 offers paid 

sick leave to these part-time workers, 

but offers unequal pay compensation 

and leaves out a majority of the 

workforce, 
including 
domestic 

workers. 

Women who make up the majority 

of unpaid caregivers and domestic 

workers, 
including 
childcare 

workers, have no safety net. These 

workers are either unemployed or 

face infection because they often 

take care of families, the elderly 

and sick people. Pregnant women 

are another extremely vulnerable 

population right now. During the 

SARS outbreak, it was noted that 

pregnant women with SARS were 

more likely to miscarry. But with 

limited data on the transmission 

of SARS and coronavirus, there is 

uncertainty and anxiety in the air. 

Staying home and quarantining 

is one of the most effective ways to 

stop the spread of the virus. Families, 

then, are left with the decision of 

how to divide the labor at home. 

Women in dual-income households 

who are “poor, working in service 

jobs that cannot be done from home” 

will often bear the bulk of childcare 

responsibilities and stay home.

The economic impact of the virus 

will hit women, a majority of service 

and 
part-time 
workers, 
harder. 

Julia Smith, a research associate at 

Simon Fraser University, said that 

the Ebola outbreak in West Africa 

greatly affected the economy but 

“men’s income returned to what they 

had made pre-outbreak faster than 

women’s income.” If there is anything 

to be learned from past epidemics 

like Ebola it’s that women will have a 

harder time bouncing back from this 

economic recession.

Since President Donald Trump 

declared 
coronavirus 
a 
national 

emergency on March 13, the U.S. 

has worked quickly to pass the paid 

sick leave bill (even though this 

exempted millions of workers). But 

had the U.S. been better prepared, 

we could already be focusing on an 

equitable, gender-based response. 

More cities should already have 

paid sick leave and health insurance 

benefits for employees. Domestic 

and service workers should have 

labor protections already. Lack of 

employee benefits and protections 

are all public health risks.

In a sense, women are at the 

center of this pandemic, yet do we 

really 
think 
our 
administration 

will address these gender-sensitive 

policy needs? Lawmakers cannot 

ignore gender needs anymore during 

this crisis. Instead, they should take 

it as an opportunity to challenge 

existing social dynamics and deeply 

entrenched gender roles.

FROM THE DAILY

In response to the University’s housing emails
O

n March 17, students received an email from University of Michigan 
Housing titled “URGENT: Petition to Remain in Housing.” The email, 
asking students “who truly have no other alternatives” to submit 

a request to remain in student housing by 8 a.m. the next day or lose building 
access, drew fire for the short notice and for backtracking on the University’s 
previous statement that students would be allowed to stay in the dorms. Further, 
the information in the email was not communicated to faculty, leaving professors 
blindsided and oblivious to the stressful situations their students had been placed 
in. 

The following day, Housing 

sent an email apologizing for 

the confusion and clarified that 

students had indeed not been 

required to move out at 8 a.m. 

that day. They offered support 

for students moving out and 

outlined the procedure for those 

who chose to stay in the dorms.

In these unprecedented times, 

we understand that no response 

on the part of the administration 

is perfect. Given how rapidly 

the situation 
changed 
with 

each new day, the University 

was forced to weigh the public 

health risks of leaving dorms 

open 
while 
accommodating 

students who were either unable 

to leave or had to coordinate 

arrangements in moving out. 

However, times of crisis call 

for 
clear 
and 
transparent 

communication. The array of 

emails and follow-up emails that 

students received from varying 

sources often failed to convey 

transparency and specificity in 

the University’s actions, creating 

confusion that could have been 

avoided had the administration 

simply been more clear and 

specific about their intentions 

in the original email. This 

undue stress and confusion only 

amplify students’ anxiety as 

they scramble to arrange flights, 

pack up belongings and adjust to 

online classes. 

Further, professors were left 

in the dark. Many had planned 

to carry on classes and exams 

during or soon after the time 

that students were moving out 

and were shocked and indignant 

that they, as professors, had 

received no information about 

this policy from the University. 

The 
multiple 
sources 
of 

information only added to the 

confusion as students received 

a number of emails regarding 

housing changes from Housing, 

the LSA Dean‘s Office and the 

Office of the Vice President of 

Student Life, making it difficult 

to discern the real authority on 

the matter. We believe that the 

confusion could be eliminated 

by creating a single, centralized 

source on behalf of the University 

administration to disseminate 

information regarding COVID-

19 updates and protocol, like 

U-M Public Affairs’ COVID-19 

information website, and only 

releasing information from that 

source and email address. In 

addition, the University should 

create better interdepartmental 

communication 
systems 
to 

ensure moving forward that 

professors are aware of the 

information 
their 
students 

are 
receiving 
and 
able 
to 

accommodate accordingly. 

While the policies put in place 

were necessarily reactionary, 

reflecting the rapidly escalating 

nature of the situation, we believe 

that the rapid response failed 

to account for the precarious 

food and housing situations of 

many students and jeopardized 

their safety and well-being. The 

vague terminology of “students 

who 
truly 
have 
no 
other 

alternative” raises questions as 

to which students are included 

and excluded, particularly for 

students 
with 
unsafe 
home 

conditions. The policy thrusts 

these students into a situation 

that could compromise their 

mental health and safety. In 

attempting to account for these 

students, the Maize & Blue 

Cupboard remains open and 

the University has consolidated 

residential hall services to West 

Quad Residence Hall and South 

Quad Residence Hall and dining 

services to South Quad.

The 
coronavirus 
has 

forced 
everyone, 
including 

students, 
faculty 
and 

University 
administrators 
to 

improvise and adjust in our 

current disorder. Though the 

University’s response has fallen 

short at times, we as students 

need to understand that the 

administration 
doesn’t 
have 

all the answers right now. 

Their actions reflect continued 

efforts to communicate with 

the student body and make 

accommodations 
without 

jeopardizing 
public 
health, 

namely by providing a partial 

refund for housing and meal 

plan expenses, keeping select 

dorms and dining halls open 

and offering free packing and 

storage services to students. In 

the end, no response that the 

University comes up with will 

be perfect and we should try to 

manage our reactions to each 

successive email that is released. 

However, this means we should 

learn from the shortcomings 

of 
the 
University’s 
initial 

response. Moving forward, the 

administration should reflect 

on students’ struggles in the 

COVID-19 pandemic in order 

to prepare better response 

protocols should future crises 

arise, and to make sure that 

communication 
from 
here 

on out is clear, accurate and 

widespread.

In the end, no 

response that the 
University comes 
up with will be 

perfect.

Bacurau is in trouble. First, the small 

Brazilian town, somewhere near São Paulo, 

has its water cut off. Then it loses cell 

service and disappears from satellite maps. 

Later, its electricity cuts out. Its residents 

soon realize that this is no accident. Their 

village is under siege. 

“Bacurau,” directed by Juliano Dornelles 

(“O Ateliê da Rua do Brum”) and Kleber 

Mendonça Filho (“Aquarius”), is a wild 

piece of pulp cinema. Yet, deep down, it’s 

also a scathing critique of imperialism in its 

many forms. “Bacurau” is satire on the edge 

of a knife, political commentary delivered 

by storms of machine gunfire and written in 

blood. It’s one of 2020’s most entertaining 

movies yet. 

Bárbara Colen’s (“Outer Edge”) Teresa 

comes back to Bacurau for her grandmother’s 

funeral. The town is a single dusty street 

and most of its buildings are run down. The 

church has become storage space and their 

single tourist attraction — a museum about 

Bacurau’s history — is rarely visited. 

Yet its inhabitants care deeply about one 

another, which the movie takes great care 

to emphasize early on. They gather for the 

grandmother’s funeral and sing in unison 

as they carry her to the grave. They share 

food and medicine and work together to get 

water when it’s cut off by the powers that 

be. The denizens of the town are diverse and 

individually characterized, of many races, 

sexual orientations and gender identities. 

A highlight is Sonia Braga’s (“Wonder”) 

Dominga, the town doctor who gets some of 

the film’s funniest lines. 

The first act, while mostly tranquil, 

is so well written and performed that it 

could have lasted the rest of the movie. Yet 

danger soon comes to Bacurau. A gang of 

white mercenaries, led by Udo Kier (“Iron 

Sky”), wants to kill everyone in the town. 

Their motivations are unclear for most of 

the movie’s runtime — all one knows is 

that they’re immature psychopaths who 

only value white lives and love guns to the 

point of fetishization. Yet in most American 

movies they’d be the heroes.

Hollywood and xenophobia have always 

gone hand in hand. There are countless 

movies where white people go to an 

“uncivilized” place and encounter people of 

color who want to kill, eat or sacrifice them. 

This is no 20th century trend, either. “The 

Green Inferno” in 2013 had white students 

go try and save the Brazillian rainforest 

only to be eaten by native people. In 2015, 

perhaps even more heinously, “No Escape” 

Owen Wilson and Pierce Brosnan are chased 

around Thailand by crowds of gun-toting, 

crazed Southeast Asian people. Mainstream 

American films love placing white people 

in fictionally hostile cultures and showing 

their fight to escape, as if that was all other 

countries were good for.

This cliché isn’t just isolated to movies, 

either. Isn’t the Christopher Columbus 

most elementary schoolers learn about just 

a white man who extinguishes a culture 

deemed dangerous and inferior? Lewis and 

Clark are also iconic American pioneers, but 

didn’t they also help open the floodgates 

for imperialistic expansion? It doesn’t 

matter if the narrative is cinematic or 

historical. If a white American is in control, 

it usually follows a pattern: violent, white 

protagonists steamroll the “uncivilized” 

lands they encounter. 

The white cinematic mainstream haunts 

“Bacurau.” The mercenaries carry iconic 

American weapons like the Thompson 

Machine Gun and Colt Revolver and speak 

in earpieces like something out of “Mission 

Impossible.” They even take over the 

narrative for much of the third act, changing 

the film’s language from Portuguese to 

English and showing just how damaging 

Hollywood’s whitewashing can be, literally 

silencing the voices of an entire population. 

The townspeople of Bacurau are replaced 

by disgusting, childish villains straight out 

of a B-movie, and they are missed in each 

Americanized frame. 

Yet, unlike in many Hollywood movies, 

the clichés are broken. The townspeople 

work together to fight back in a stellar, no 

holds barred finale. Its flurry of bullets, 

blood and brains is not just a perfectly 

crafted gore show, but also a triumph over 

harmful stereotypes and the reclaiming of 

a narrative. People who aren’t Americans 

have histories, personalities and value, and 

sometimes the white man with the gun isn’t 

the hero. It’s high time America caught on 

to that.

White cinematic mainstream haunts Brazilian ‘Bacurau’

FILM REVIEW

My biceps started to ache as I rapidly whisked 

the sad, watery coffee-ground mixture with the 

manic fervor of a small child. Eyebrows furrowed 

and lips pressed together in a stubborn line, I 

was the poster image for culinary determination. 

It had been about 15 minutes since I first set my 

whisk to the coffee mixture, and I was not about 

to give up on the task at hand. The coffee would 

be whipped; it would be whipped and fluffy and 

a perfect caramel-brown color when I was done 

with it. 

Just 
one 
week 

prior, all of my classes 

had been moved to 

dinky online formats. 

And all my friends 

and I were sent back 

to the hometowns 

we had once been 

so eager to move 

away from. In one 

weekend, my dorm 

became empty and 

my inbox became full 

of canceled events I 

once looked forward 

to. Over a couple 

email 
exchanges, 

I went from having two work-study positions 

to having zero. Club meetings were canceled 

indefinitely and promising summer prospects lost 

their promise.

But, in that moment, it was just me, my whisk 

and my stupid coffee recipe that I found on 

TikTok. I was in control. No virus was going 

to stop me from turning a TikTok dream into 

a deliciously whipped, coffee-lover’s reality. I 

whisked and I whisked and I whisked.

But it just wasn’t whipping. The gritty, brown 

mixture stayed that way and there were no 

fluffiness or caramel hues in sight. I was infuriated, 

cursing under my breath like some sort of 

deranged cooking show competitor. The pressure 

was on, and the clock was ticking, as if I didn’t have 

an infinite amount of time in self-quarantine to 

whisk this stupid drink. Successfully making this 

iced coffee was my first concrete task after what 

seemed like weeks of floating around, scratching 

off events from my calendar and forcing myself to 

find contentment in days of newly-freed time. 

But I wasn’t finished yet — I whisked nobly 

onward. 
In 
an 

attempt to ease the 

physically 
taxing 

nature of my work, I 

started switching off 

my whisking hands, 

my breathing getting 

heavier with every 

passing 
minute. 
I 

adopted yet another 

strategy: tilting the 

metal 
bowl 
from 

one side to the other, 

searching 
for 
the 

perfect 
angle 
that 

would 
yield 
the 

creamy 
concoction 

TikTok had promised. Brown bubbles forming 

on the edges of the soupy mixture started to tease 

me in my culinary pursuit. I let out a few crazed 

shouts of pride as I looked down at what appeared 

to be the beginnings of a bubbly, thoroughly-

whipped beast. 

I think my mom could sense my increasing 

hysteria as she approached my mess of a chef’s 

station. Coffee grounds and sugar granules were 

peppered all over the white countertop like 

confetti. With bubbles forming then disappearing 

and coffee grounds sitting stubborn and rigid 

at the bottom of the bowl, I started to lose hope. 

I could’ve cried. It was a Friday afternoon and I 

should’ve been in Ann Arbor, in East Quad, basking 

in the excitement that is the start of the weekend 

and the promise of a night out with friends. 

Instead, I was back home in Indiana, staring at my 

icky, failed attempt at whipped happiness, with 

my mom leaning over my shoulder in concern. 

Her voice was full of pity. “You saw this on 

TikTok?” I looked down pathetically at the dirt-

like mixture and nodded.

“What kind of coffee does the recipe call for?” 

she asked.

“Instant coffee powder,” I muttered. 

I looked over at the crumbly Dunkin’ stuff I 

had just spent almost an hour trying to whisk 

into a creamy paste. The bright orange package 

read “medium roast coffee grounds.” I eyed the 

instant-coffee imposter with nervous suspicion. 

“Grace, that’s not instant coffee. Instant coffee 

is freeze-dried!” my mom exclaimed. She started 

to laugh, “That’s ground coffee!” 

I knew she was right but I didn’t want to believe 

it. The ground coffee was supposed to work and it 

was supposed to be fluffy, tasty goodness. And I 

was supposed to be in Michigan, with my classes 

and my friends and my a cappella rehearsals and 

club meetings and responsibilities. I was supposed 

to be at college.

I let out a defeated sigh as I started to clean up 

the goopy brown mess. 

Whipped coffee: 1.

COVID-19: 1.

Me: 0.

“There will be more recipes,” my mom added.

And she was right. There will be more recipes 

and there will be more semesters and more 

responsibilities. And when those times come, I 

might miss the Friday afternoon I spent whisking 

my heart away at something as unimportant and 

frivolous as whipped coffee.

THE COOKING FOODIE

Bacurau 

Vitrine Filmes 

State Theatre Virtual Screenings


On Tuesday, March 24, Gov. Gretchen 

Whitmer released a stay-at-home executive 

order for all individuals in Michigan. Exceptions 

include those who require groceries and living 

essentials, as well as workers who are essential 

to sustain and protect life or those required 

to maintain basic business operations. Among 

those businesses still running are grocery stores 

and restaurants. However, you may be confused 

about the general guidelines that should be 

followed in terms of public and food safety in 

times of a pandemic. 

Is it actually safe for restaurants to continue to 

prepare food? Should you support local restaurant 

businesses, or would that put restaurant 

employees and delivery drivers at risk? What is 

the best way to go grocery shopping during the 

pandemic? What should be the procedure for 

cleanliness and hygiene? 

To answer those questions, here are your 

guidelines for the coronavirus and food safety 

throughout the pandemic, based on my research.

What should I know about the coronavirus?

The coronavirus causing the current COVID-

19 pandemic is called SARS-CoV-2. It bears a 

close resemblance to its cousins SARS-CoV-1 

(the coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS 

outbreak) and MERS-CoV (the one that caused 

the 2012 MERS outbreak). Though SARS-CoV-2 

resembles previous existing coronaviruses, it is 

a novel virus — information about the virus is 

constantly developing as many researchers are 

learning more about it.

Here’s something that we do know: the 

coronavirus is NOT the flu. While both the 

coronavirus and the flu are respiratory diseases, 

the coronavirus is in a completely different family 

of viruses than the flu. COVID-19 possesses 

different symptoms (assuming a person is not 

asymptomatic) while being capable of spreading 

and killing more quickly and efficiently than the 

flu.

How does the coronavirus spread?

As a respiratory virus, the coronavirus spreads 

primarily through your respiratory system. The 

Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention 

states that the main form of transmission of the 

coronavirus is through inhalation of respiratory 

droplets that are produced whenever an infected 

person coughs or sneezes. The transmission can 

be exacerbated through close contact (less than 

six feet distance) among individuals. 

While the most contagious people are thought 

to be those who are sickest, it’s important to note 

that the spread of the coronavirus is also possible 

from those who have not yet shown COVID-19 

symptoms.

Currently, there is little to no evidence that 

the coronavirus can spread through means other 

than aerosolization. While transmission could 

theoretically occur through contact with recently 

contaminated surfaces, sources such as the 

German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment 

(BfR) state that this would be extremely unlikely 

as coronaviruses themselves are relatively 

unstable within the outside environment. 

How long can the coronavirus survive on 

common surfaces?

A study published by The New England 

Journal of Medicine indicates that aerosolized 

coronavirus can survive within air for up to three 

hours. On cardboard surfaces, that time increases 

to 24 hours. On stainless steel surfaces as well as 

plastics, that time increases to three days. 

This means that any time an infected 

individual coughs or sneezes on an item 

(including asymptomatic employees of essential 

businesses), the virus is likely to remain active 

and viable on that item for longer than if it were 

to be in the air. This may include items such as 

cardboard delivery boxes or plastic take-out 

containers. Luckily, the concentration of viable 

viruses will decrease quickly in the beginning 

and slowly approach a concentration of zero. 

Sources such as the BfR state that chances 

of transmission via contaminated objects 

still remain low because of the virus’s innate 

instability towards outside elements — due to the 

logarithmic decay of viable viruses. However, 

practices such as washing your hands after 

handling outside mail and packages as well as 

transferring food contents from grocery stores 

and restaurants, when applicable, can help 

further reduce the innate viral load that you may 

pick up from outside items. 

Can you contract COVID-19 from contaminated 

food?

Multiple sources such as the European Food 

Safety Authority and the U.S. Department of 

Agriculture find no current evidence to suggest 

that the coronavirus can be transmitted through 

food packaging or the food itself. The U.S. Food 

and Drug Administration defines a food-borne 

outbreak as an event that occurs when individuals 

get the same disease through the ingestion of the 

same contaminated food. 

A 2018 study indicates that the transmission 

route of respiratory diseases closely resembles 

the current transmission trajectory and patterns 

of the novel coronavirus. Government action 

from Singapore and South Korea that has tracked 

known infected individuals has noted that many 

of these individuals that have contracted the 

coronavirus are clustered together — which 

corroborates the 2018 study.

What are my risks of contracting COVID-19 

from cooking at home, delivery or takeout?

Your likelihood of contracting COVID-19 

is tied to your proximity to and frequency of 

interactions with others. In other words, you are 

more likely to come into contact with multiple 

individuals when you decide to order takeout 

as opposed to ordering delivery of groceries or 

cooking at home.

Restaurants and other food providers are 

under strict federal and state regulations in terms 

of proper hygiene within a professional setting. 

Restaurants who do not follow these regulations 

face severe consequences ranging from public 

posted notices to complete shutdowns. 

Within Ann Arbor, restaurant signs alerting 

residents of their takeout or delivery only policies 

also tend to state that they are committed to 

adding extra precautions such as wearing gloves 

and utilizing hand sanitizers on top of keeping 

and regulating the high hygiene standards as 

required for most foodservice industries.

There are risks associated with groceries and 

cooking at home. Restaurants and restaurant 

workers tend to follow a higher safety standard 

than that of the average supermarket and grocery 

store worker. Following certain guidelines can 

help reduce the likelihood of contracting the 

coronavirus — treat all items taken from outside 

your home (such as packages and groceries) as 

potentially contaminated. Wash your hands 

after bringing in outside items as well as before, 

during and after cooking, sanitize all containers/

products and transfer products to clean 

containers. 

Jeffrey VanWingen, a doctor at Grand 

Rapids’s Family Medicine Specialists, offers a 

detailed video guide on how to best sterilize your 

groceries in the midst of the pandemic.

COVID-19 and food: a consumer’s guide for the pandemic

DAILY FOOD COLUMN

“I can’t stand the rain, outside my window 

/ Bringing back sweet memories,” Ann 

Peebles sang in 1974, and the world of soul 

and hip hop changed forever. The song those 

lyrics belong to, “I Can’t Stand the Rain,” is a 

masterpiece on its own, a mesmerizing romp 

through memory and heartache told through 

Peebles’s unmistakably raspy vocals. “I Can’t 

Stand the Rain” is the title track of her 1974 

album, an effort that brought her to 25 on the 

US R&B charts and established her innovative 

storytelling and song structure as a mainstay 

of music production for years to come. The 

thing is, Peeble’s story doesn’t end at her own 

music, nor at her own successes throughout a 

life of respect in the industry — she’s one of the 

most-sampled artists in hip-hop history. Now, 

I’m listening to her beautiful songs as they 

were meant to be heard: on their own. She’s 

a well-kept secret that deserves to be less of a 

secret.

The most striking sampling of Peebles’s 

work is with this very song, worked into Missy 

Elliott’s hit “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly).” Yeah, 

that song. The one with the video where Missy 

seems to be wearing a bicycle helmet on her 

head and a garbage bag on her body. The hook 

in the background of “Beep beep, who got 

the keys to my Jeep?” is not actually Missy 

herself, but Peebles. The song also shows up 

in “Rain” by Mick Jenkins, “Demolitions” by 

Kaytranada, and according to whosampled.

com (a truly amazing resource for curious 

hip-hop minds), 18 other songs. And those are 

just the songs that used enough of Peebles’s 

original track to pay royalties — you can only 

imagine the amount of SoundCloud rappers 

who have taken one snare or pitched-up the 

initial hook from the song and dropped it into 

their own mixes.

Peebles’s discography was a goldmine for 

the earliest master samplers; we’re talking the 

real big ones, like J Dilla, GZA of the Wu-Tang 

Klan and those bracing electronica and hip-hop 

like Gramatik. It didn’t stop at “I Can’t Stand 

the Rain,” but branched into songs of hers 

like “Trouble, Heartaches and Sadness” from 

an earlier album, which is featured on GZA’s 

incredible track “Shadowboxin’.” Though that 

use of Peebles’s work in particular only takes 

a small portion of the original material and 

integrates it into the new mix, it’s the groove 

of songs like “Trouble” that makes her music 

so incredibly good for samples. 

She 
manages 
to 
infuse 
a 
sense 
of 

dancehall bounce into even the saddest, most 

heartbreaking soul songs, her voice both 

soothing and worn-down from years of truth-

telling, perfectly merging with the playful 

’70s instrumentation that characterized her 

earliest work. That’s what makes her music 

so catchy, even out of context — every track 

in the mix has that groove, even isolated from 

the rest of the song. The vocals are beautiful 

alone, but so are the horns, the keyboard 

track, the chimes, the drums and the cymbal 

that only crashes once. It’s like Peebles had 

imagined each line on its own and then layered 

them, creating beautiful songs that are just 

as beautiful when separated as they are put 

together. 

Even if you don’t recognize what parts 

of her songs have been woven into other 

favorites of yours, listening to Ann Peebles 

is always worth it. On her own, without any 

of the knowledge of her incredible history of 

sampling, she is a force to be reckoned with in 

her own era of soul and R&B, merging the sass 

of an artist like Aretha Franklin with the ease 

of Minnie Riperton. Her voice is unmistakable, 

her groove can make you dance even if you’re 

crying at the same time. Maybe you’ve heard 

her before without knowing it, but once you 

do, you can’t go back — she’s everywhere, not 

just in the rain.
