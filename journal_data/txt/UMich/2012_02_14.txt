UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION
'U' pres.

America
Coleman plans trip to
Brazil this summer to
foster exchanges
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
While many University students
will be working at internships and
jobs around the nation this sum-
mer, University President Mary Sue
Coleman will be miles away trying
to provide students with additional
opportunities when they return in
the fall.
In June, Coleman will travel to
Brazil to work with educational
institutions throughout South
America to strengthen existing
partnerships and develop new pro-
grams. These programs will not
only benefit University students,
but also provide expanded exchange
programs for students throughout
Latin America.
In a Jan. 23 interview, Coleman
told The Michigan Daily that she
normally takes one trip abroad each
year, with occasional shorter, spe-
cial trips. In years past, she has trav-
eled to Africa and China to negotiate

BOARD OF REGENTS
Renovation
plans to be
discussed

Plans for East
Quad, Lawyer's
Club projects will
go before regents
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
After approving a $116 mil-
lion renovation to East Quad
Residence Hall in July and $39
million in improvements to
the Lawyer's Club in March,
University officials will, seek
approval from the University's
Board of Regents to award con-
tracts for these projects at their
monthly meeting on Thursday.
In a communication to the
regents, Timothy Slottow, the
University's executive vice
president and chief financial
officer, and E. Royster Harper,
the University's vice president
for student affairs, wrote that
the University is prepared to
finalize contracts and begin
building this summer.
"The renovation (of East
Quad) will update infrastruc-
ture, including: new plumbing,
heating, cooling, ventilation,
fire detection and suppression

systems; wired and wireless
high speed network access, ren-
ovated bath facilities; and acces-
sibility improvements," Slottow
and Harper wrote.
The project will also provide
a renovated home for the Uni-
versity's Residential College,
which has occupied retrofit-
ted space in East Quadrangle
since its inception in 1967. Slot-
tow and Harper noted that the
RC's offices were originally
bedrooms and most of the class-
rooms are currently in the base-
ment of the building.
Separately, Slottow requested
that the regents also approve
bids for renovations to the Law-
yer's Club and the John P. Cook
Building. Ina communication to
the regents, Slottow wrote that
the renovations would do away
with the "townhouse-style"
entries to the residences and
create an interior corridor to
foster "a sense of community for
the residents." -
According to a master sched-
ule of construction projects
included with the regents'
meeting items, the renovations
of both East Quad and the Law-
yer's Club are to be completed
by summer 2013.

Student to launch
Walk of Shame ride

BROADCAST NEWS

Service to offer $5
ride, water bottle,
Plan B coupon
By HALEY GOLDBERG and
MARISA WINTER
Daily News Editor and Daily Staff
Reporter
The weekend ritual of half-
dressed students staggering
home the morning after a night
of debauchery may be an event
of the past thanks to the newly
created Walk of Shame Shuttle.
Art & Design senior Kellyann
Wargo developed the transpor-
tation service, which offers a
packaged deal to customers for
$5 that includes a ride, a bottle
of water, a $5 coupon on a Plan
B pill and a "complimentary
high five" according to the com-
pany's online flyer.
Wargo said she created the
service as a way for students
to avoid an embarrassing walk
home or having to call a taxi
early in the morning following
a sexual rendezvous or drunk-
en outing.
"Chances are someone is
calling me because their hook-
up doesn't have a car and won't
walk them home, so they feel
bad enough about themselves
already," Wargo said. "I want
to create a comfortable, safe,
entertaining atmosphere ... I
genuinely have my passengers'

best interest at heart because I
know how much walking home
or taking a taxi sucks."
Wargo said the business
model was inspired from her
personal experiences shuttling
friends back to their homes in
the morning after long nights
out, after which she would
often receive fast food as com-
pensation.
"I'd spend a lot of time pick-
ing up friends and they would
buy me McDonald's in return,"
Wargo said. "We were spend-
ing a lot of time at McDonald's
and I wondered, 'Can you give
me money instead?"'
Wargo said she is currently
working with Student Legal
Services and other services
on campus in order to begin
operating her business. The
service, which will be exclusive
to University students, will run
Wednesday from 7 a.m. to 12
p.m. and Friday through Sun-
day from 7a.m. to 2 p.m.
She added that at first the
service will be limited to stu-
dents who are her acquaintanc-
es, and customers must text her
with their name and location.
"When my license and ser-
vice is legal, I will only pick up
friends, or friends of friends,
who have to tell me the first and
last name of someone I know
well and how they know them
tobe safe," Wargo said.

Book store strike

30 years ago this week (Feb.
13, 1982): Employees at the Uni-
versity Cellar, a student-run book-
store, staged a "sick-out" in protest
of unfair salaries. According to The
Michigan Daily, officials said almost
all of the union members who work
at U-Cellar - approximately 85 per-
cent of the employees - called in
sick.
The catalyst for the "sick-out"
was the U-Cellar Board of Direc-
tors' decision the week before to pay
the management staff a $250 bonus.
U-Cellar manager Bob Carlson
said he thought employees would be
back to work the next day.
"I think it will prove to be just a
one-day flu streak," Carlson said.

60 years ago this week (Feb.
13, 1952): The University Student
Legislature passed a bill to help
eliminate bias in campus organiza-
tions with a vote of 27 in favor, one
opposed, and eight abstentions, the
Daily reported.
The bill urged the University's
Student Affairs Committee to make
it mandatory for campus organi-
zations that have discriminatory
clauses in their constitutions to
petition their national committees
to remove them. The bill asked SAC
to refuse recognition to any organi-
zation that refused to do so.
Reactions were mixed, with
some Student Legislature members

saying the bill was too weak to be
effective, and proposing a timeline
to reevaluate the bill. The motion
to implement a timeline for the anti-
bias proposal failed by a vote of 22 in
favor and 14 opposed.

the Daily reported.
Council' members said they
changed the curfew from 1:30 a.m.
to 12:30 a.m. to save electricity,
ensure coed physical fitness, "bring
the war home to the students" and
address the problem of coeds not
being able to donate blood due to

Greeks clean up after riots opposing
austerity vote, more than 120 injured .

At least 45
buildings burned,
67 arrested, 68
police injured
ATHENS, Greece - Firefight-
ers doused smoldering buildings
and cleanup crews swept rubble
from the streets of central Ath-
ens last night following a night
of rioting during which lawmak-
ers approved harsh new austerity
measures demanded by bailout
creditors to save the nation from
bankruptcy.
At least 45 buildings were
burned, including one of the capi-
tal's oldest cinemas, while dozens
of stores and cafes were smashed
and looted.
The stench of tear gas still hung
in the air yesterday morning,
choking passers-by. More than
120 people were hurt in the riot-
ing which also broke out in other
Greek cities. Authorities said 68
police needed medical care after

being injured by gasoline bombs,
rocks and other objects hurled at
them, while at least 70 protesters
were also hospitalized.
Police arrested at least 67 peo-
ple, while in several cases they
had to escort fire crews to burn-
ingbuildings after protesters pre-
vented access.
The rioting began Sunday
afternoon ahead of a landmark
vote in Parliament on yet more
austerity measures. The dras-
tic cuts debated in parliament
include axing one in five civil ser-
vice jobs over the next three years
and slashing the minimum wage
by more than a fifth.
Lawmakers approved the bill
in a 199-74 vote - to the relief of
investors who pushed the Athens
stock index up 5 percent yesterday.
The vote paves the way for
Greece's international creditors
to release euroI30 billion ($172
billion) in new rescue loans to
prevent the country from a poten-
tially catastrophic default next
month - bankruptcy could push
Greece out of Europe's euro cur-

rency union, drag down other
troubled eurozone countries and
further roil global markets.
There was nevertheless strong
dissentover the austerity package
among the majority Socialists and
rival Conservatives who make up
Greece's interim coalition gov-
ernment. The parties disciplined
the dissenters in their ranks, with
the Socialists and Conservatives
expelling 22 and 21 lawmak-
ers respectively, reducing their
majority in the 300-member par-
liament from 236 to 193.
Germany gave the vote result
a cautious welcome, with For-
eign Minister Guido Westerwelle
describing it as "a first significant
step along the right road."
"However, the actual diffi-
cult work with implementing the
reforms that have been agreed on
is only just starting now," he said
in a statement. "That is the deci-
sive precondition for Germany
and the other euro partners being
able to stand by Greece with a
further rescue package."
"Embarking on implementa-

tion is decisive now," Westerwelle
said.
"These decisions show the will
and readiness of the Greeks to
make great efforts of their own
... to put the country on the right
track," German Chancellor Ange-
la Merkel's spokesman, Steffen
Seibert, said in Berlin.
"These measures, and we
really have to note this, are not
just saving for the sake of saving,
they are not cutting for the sake
of cutting - this is about reforms
in every political area," he said.
"These are measures that are
meant to restore step by step the
financial room for maneuver that
the country needs for new jobs
and new growth to emerge."
Germany's vice chancellor,
Philipp Roesler, also.said the vote
was "a step inthe right direction."
"It is good that the legislation
has now been approved, with a
broad majority too, but what is
decisive is the implementation of
structural reforms," Roesler, who
is also Germany's economy min-
ister, told ARD television.

WALK OF SHAME
From Pagel
Stadium Taxi in Ann Arbor, said
if the Walk of Shame Shuttle
garners widespread support on
campus, it may begin to compete
with his company's business.
"If friends are willing to
pick up other friends by hav-
ing a shuttle ride - that will
take away from our business, of
course," Newmann said.
However, Newmann said that
since the Walk of Shame Shuttle
will most likely be operating at
early morning hours, the ser-
vice would not pose as much of
a threat to his business.
"Something like that would
be beneficial for the early morn-
ing hours, from 2 to 5 a.m., it'd
be fine for someone to do that,"
Newmann said. "However, pick-
ing people up from the bar and
taking them elsewhere would
take away from our money."
Wargo said her business has
gained interest from custom-
ers who seek to avoid obtain-
ing a ride with an unknown cab
driver.
"Many girls are already
showing a lot of interest in the
service because they prefer hav-
ing a friend like me pick them up
instead of a random cab driver,"
Wargo said.

LSA senior Amanda Schwei-
gert said the Walk of Shame
Shuttle is a service that appeals
to her.
"It's a brilliant idea, and I
think Kellyann is brilliant for
starting it," Schweigert said.
"It's a service that a lot of people
want and will use because they
don't want the embarrassment
of a taxi."
After creating the online
flyer and posting it to her Face-
book, Wargo said her prospec-
tive business went viral, gaining
attention on BroBible.com, a
website dedicated to teaching
the "Bro Code," which was
linked to by Sports Illustrated's
website, SI.com. She added that
the mass coverage was uninten-
tional.
"At first, the plan was just to
offer this service to friends as a
way for them to pay me for my
work," Wargo said. "I didn't
think other people would be
interested in this until it went
viral."
Known for her comedic Tum-
bir, Ginger Ambition that has
gained increased popularity,
Wargo said she aspires to be the
next red-headed Chelsea Han-
dler. If Walk of Shame Shuttle
becomes an established busi-
ness, she hopes to sell the com-
pany and pursue her dreams
related to writing and comedy.

Mich. unions sue
over state worker
pension changes
A coalition of state employee
labor unions sued the state of
Michigan yesterday, saying recent
changes to the funding of the
employees' retirement systems are
unconstitutional,
The suit filed in Ingham Coun-
ty Circuit Court challenges a law
approved by the Legislature and
signed late last year by Gov. Rick
Snyder.
The law requires employees
who choose to remain in the state's
defined benefit or pension plan to
contribute 4 percent of their com-
pensation toward the system.
HOOPA VALLEY INDIAN
RESERVATION, Calif.
Magnitude-5.6
quake strikes rural
Northern Calif.
A moderate earthquake struck
Northern California's coast yes-
terday afternoon, rattling nerves
around the Oregon border but
yielding no immediate reports of
major injuries or damage, officials
said.
The magnitude-5.6 quake
struck at 1:07 p.m. about 18 miles
inland in an unincorporated part
of Humboldt County, the .U.S.
Geological Survey said. The epi-
center was a rural area near the
small community of Weitchpec
* on the Hoopa Valley Indian Res-
ervation, about 240 miles north of
San Francisco and about 60 miles
south of the Oregon border.
The temblor was widely felt
within a 100-mile radius, accord-
ingto the USGS website.
CARACAS, Venezuela
Opposition party
selects Chavez's
political rival
Youthful state governor Hen-
rique Capriles won Venezuela's
first-ever opposition presidential
primary Sunday by a wide mar-
gin, emerging as the single candi-
date who will try to end President
Hugo Chavez's 13 years in power.
Capriles, the 39-year-old gov-
ernor of Miranda state who
describes himself as a center-left
progressive, faces a tough task
in ousting Chavez, a charismatic
campaigner with a loyal following
and the full powers of the state to
back his candidacy in Oct. 7 elec-
tions.
Opposition election chief Tere-
sa Albanes announced the prelim-
inary results, saying that Capriles
won about 62 percent of the vote,
beating Zulia state Gov. Pablo
Perez by a margin of more than 30
percentage points.
Chavez's opponents lined up

to vote in many areas, surpassing
most expectations with a turnout
of about 2.9 million ballots, cast
out of Venezuela's 18 million reg-
istered voters.
ZAGREB, Croatia
On Valentine's day,
a museum about
broken hearts
What becomes of a garden
gnome hurled in fury at a wind-
screen during a stormy breakup?
Or a teddy bear that was once
a Valentine's Day present? A
wedding dress from a marriage
gone awry? An ax that smashed
through household furniture?
All are on display at the Muse-
um of Broken Relationships in the
Croatian capital, each with writ-
ten testimonies telling tales of
passion, romance and heartbreak.
On Valentine's Day, the muse-
um sees its visits almost double.
"The objects that are here rep-
resent all the stages of a breakup.
and how people go through love,"
said Drazen Grubisic, a designer
and artist who co-founded the
museum in 2010 in the Croatian
capital.
"We might say it's a love muse-
um, just upside down," he said.

RENOVATION
From Page1 -
NORTH CAMPUS
COMPUTER SCIENCE AND
ENGINEERING BUILDING
TOBE RENAMED
In a communication to the
regents, Slottow and David
Munson, dean of the College of
Engineering, recommended that
the regents formally change the
name of the Computer Science
and Engineering Building on
North Campus to the Bob and
Betty Beyster Building.
Slottow and Munson wrote
that the achievements of Uni-
versity alum J. Robert Beyster
merit the honor, citing his work
in both the private sector and
his philanthropic contributions.
Beyster founded the engineering
research company Science Appli-
cations International Corpora-
tion, which aims to apply science
and technology in innovative
ways, and employed 43,000 at

the time of Beyster's retirement
in 2004, according to the SAIC
website.
According to the communi-
cation, -Beyster recently made a
contribution of $15 million to the
College of Engineering to sup-
port research and academics, as
well as establish a graduate-level
fellowship.
"Funds will be used in part
to create the J. Robert Beyster
Computational Innovation Grad-
uate Fellows Program to support
research in a variety of fields
linking high-performance com-
puting, networking, and storage
to applications of societal impor-
tance," Slottow and Munson
wrote.
UNIVERSITY INVESTS IN
NEW FUNDS
As a part of an effort to diver-
sify and expand the University's
investments, Slottow informed
the regents of the University's
additional commitment of $80

million to funds previously
approved by the regents. These
investments do not require addi-
tional voting, since the regents
had already approved each fund's
initial investment in the past.
The additional funds cover a
variety of sectors includingsecu-
rities, natural gas exploration,
renewable energy and develop-
ing market companies, according
to the communication.
In a separate communication,
Slottow wrote that the Univer-
sity is seeking approval from the
regents to invest $10 million in
a real estate fund in Asia. The
fund's principal investment is a
joint partnership project with
the Chinese government to build
office buildings, shopping cen-
ters and transportation hubs.
"This commitment offers the
University an attractive oppor-
tunity to invest in a project in
China that has been significant-
ly de-risked due to its almost
completed status," Slottow
wrote.

of the Ann Arbor community,"
Reed said. "Beyond education,
however, we want a2energy to
be a call to action and a means
to do so."
Rebecca Filbey, project man-
ager at Clean Energy Coalition,
said information provided on
the website will promote active
participation in sustainable
practices.
"The whole point of the (sus-
tainability) program is to be
able to address promoters, rent-
ers, landlords, business owners
or property owners across the
city to make them more aware
of the impact of energy use
in the home or in properties,
and the importance of taking
action to reduce energy, to start
to consider renewable energy
opportunities," Filbey said.
Filbey added that homeown-
ers should work to improve
insulation in their homes
to prevent air leakage and

decrease energy usage.
"We're not just talking about
a small piece of the pie," she
said. "This is a really big impact
as far as energy use all togeth-
er."
City Councilmember Sandi
Smith (D-Ward 1) said resi-
dents contribute to the majority
of the city's energy waste.
"Sixty percent of our energy
use in consumption is residen-
tial and we need to help our
residents understand that there
are ways to save money, invest
in improving their house, and
here are some tools to that
effect," Smith said.
Smith added that commer-
cial owners are presented with
financing options, such as the
Property Assess Clean Energy
program, to alleviate the costs
associated with making their
properties more sustainable.
PACE programs seek to pass
legislation to help individual
communities maintain energy
efficiency, according to the
PACE website.
Andrew Brix, energy pro-

grams manager for Ann Arbor,
said City Council's goal is to
make Ann Arbor carbon neutral
and use 100-percent renewal
energy. He added that the new
website is a component of the
city's long-term sustainability
goals, and is primarily intended
to function as an informational
tool.
"Part of it is for folks to
know what they can do," he
said. "The website by itself is
not going to get us to climate
neutral, but it's a piece of the
puzzle. It's also a mechanism
for having a conversation."
Due to the city's diverse
population of residents, com-
muters, students and busi-
ness owners, Brix said the
site provides many different
approaches to sustainable liv-
ing that apply to a wide range
of circumstances.
"Everyone's going to have
slightly different needs and
different opportunities in
terms of what they can do, and
were trying to get people to the
solutions that work for them."

agreements similar to those that
will be discussed in Brazil.
"When we started looking at
Latin America, it became very
apparent that some of our best
relationships were with Brazil,"
Coleman said. "We have quite a
few interactions with the health
sciences and with scientific
research, (and) in some of the
social science areas."
Coleman said she usually
travels to areas where the Uni-
versity has already.established a
presence in an effort to strength-
ening existing relationships.
"One of the things that we do
before Iever take an internation-
al trip is to look at where faculty
have programs, where students
are going - (I ask) 'where can I
strengthen the ties?"' Coleman
said. "Where can we think of
some new programs that would
provide new opportunities for
our students?"
Mark Tessler, the Univer-
sity's vice provost for interna-
tional affairs, said eight senior
faculty members from a variety
of departments will accompany
Coleman on her trip in an effort
to represent the University's
academic diversity. He said the
faculty members who will travel
with Coleman have not yet been
determined and added that the
number may fluctuate.
"It's possible that if there's
someplace that she can't go, that
her schedule will be too full, that
one or two members of the del-
egation will go off and represent
Michigan in conversations with
these other (institutions)," Tes-,
sler said.
A primary part of the trip to
South America will be to work
with national foundations and
institutions in Brazil that will
help proposed programs mature
and receive the funding they
need. Tessler said one of the
main goals of the trip would be
to assess the needs and priorities
of partner universities in Brazil.
"We view this partnership as
very reciprocal," Tessler said.
"It's not just what we want to
do - it's what makes sense for
the people we're working with
there. This is a process of evolu-
tion as we hear more about what
makes sense for them."
Tessler said faculty members
would serve as guides on the
trip and also meet privately with
their counterparts in Brazil,
Chile and Peru to work on pro-

grams in greater detail. He cited
health sciences, natural resourc-
es and the environment, sustain-
ability, diversity and political
science as likely areas of focus
for Coleman and the delegation.
"There's a possibility that
this will lead to more students
from Brazil applying to come to
Michigan - we expect that to
happen," Tessler said.
Tessler added that students
would begin to see the benefits
of the president's trip in the
form of new programs that will
be introduced in 2013 or later,
as well as through a potential
influx, of Latin American stu-
dents on campus in Ann Arbor.
Melinda Matice, a lecturer in
the University's English Lan-
guage Institute who led a group
from the Global Intercultural
Experience for Undergraduates
program to Brazil in 2010, said
she hoped the University will
be able to attract students from
Brazil to study at the University.
Matice specifically cited a
new program from the Brazilian
government to provide 75,000
science and engineering schol-
arships for students to study
abroad,,adding that she believes
the University should try to
attract a great number of such
students.
"It would be lovely to bring
some of those (science, tech-
nology engineering and math-
ematics) scholars here," Matice
said. "I would like to see a much
more vested interest in Brazil in
both directions, but that seems
to be a remarkable program
right now."
While Matice was unable to
comment specifically on Cole-
man's trip, the said the Universi-
ty was supportive when Matice
was organizing her GIEU trip.
She added that student groups
at the University - particularly
the Pantanal Partnership, an
organization that developed a
school in Mato Grosso, Brazil
and works to cultivate educa-
tional and health programs in
the country - are helpful in pro-
viding opportunities for Univer-
sity students from a variety of
disciplines.
"There's so much diversity,
(and) not just biodiversity (in
Brazil), but also what goes on in
the urban areas - it's an excit-
ing place to have a connection
with," Matice said. "They're
poised to make a lot- of chang-
es, and it would be nice to see
the University take part in all
of those areas of growth and
change."

and said there was a necessity
to emphasize that the commit-
tee does not support intimida-
tion by students or faculty.
"I feel we should be neu-
tral," Larsen said. "We should
endorse the principle that, of
course, we should not have
intimidation."
A paragraph was initially
included in the document that
suggests that the community
views Dibbern's accusations
against her adviser, Engineer-
ing prof. Rachel Goldman, as
false.
"(The committee's) support
of free and open debate comes
in light of widespread false
accusations of intimidation
directed at the faculty at large,
and one faculty member in par-
ticular," the paragraph stated.
"We call on such innuendo and
defamation to end, in order that
a dignified exchange of ideas be
restored."
Members of the committee
said they felt this paragraph
was inflammatory and moved
to strike it. The committee also
unanimously voted to adda sen-
tence to the end of the revised

MEMBERS DISCUSS
UMHS INVESTIGATION
FINDINGS
SACUA chair Kate Barald
also presented a statement
responding to the Universi-
ty's recently released internal
investigation of the alleged
child pornography possession
by former medical resident Ste-
phen Jenson at UMHS.
"It is expected by Senate
Assembly that the University
will use this incident to care-
fully consider the recommen-
dations of the Senate Assembly
Resolution 122311-2 on report-
ing criminal activity in the
most expeditious and effective
manner," the statement read.
The statement refers to a
previous resolution, passed by
electronic vote on Dec. 23,2011,
which encouraged the Univer-
sity to develop more efficient
criminal reporting methods.
The committee unanimously
voted in favor of affirming the
resolution.

After reading the statement
aloud, Barald said increased
communication and effective
protocol in reporting incidenc-
es are essential in cases regard-
ing UMHS.
"(The statement is) in the
spirit of trying to encourage
education, information about
reporting lines that every sin-
gle person in the University to
have in their cognizance as they
begin to face such issues."

tance of faculty in celebrating
the 200-year anniversary of the

Sure to be a classic
NHL deal with the 'Uhas numerous benefits
umors were confirmed last week when the National Hockey
League officially announced it would host the 2013 Winter
. . Classic at Michigan Stadium. Though it was public knowledge
that the NHL had been negotiating with the Athletic Department
since last November, the announcement still created a buzz through-
out campus. Hosting the prestigious event is a great opportunity for
both the University and the city of Ann Arbor, and the University
should look for more opportunities like this in the future.

HARSHA
NAHATA

Last Wednesday, the University's Board of
Regents unanimously voted to grant the NHL
a one-month lease to host the Winter Classic
on Jan. 1, 2013. The University will receive a
$3 million fee, and the NHL made a $250,000
-donation to the University as part of the deal.
University administrators have said the money
will go toward student scholarships.
Since the Big House would normally go
unused in January, the financial, benefits of
hosting the Winter Classic are a bonus for
the University. The city of Ann Arbor is also
expected to benefit from the event. Accord-
ing to Athletic Director Dave Brandon,
the Winter Classic is expected to generate
approximately $14 million in economic activ-
ity for the city. With most students at home
for winter break, this abnormal financial
boost will stimulate Ann Arbor's economy.
The NHL's decision to lease the Big House
also gives the University national media atten-
tion. Just weeks after President Barack Obama
chose to deliver a speech on the University's
campus, the NHL's decision has brought more
positive media attention to the University. The
NHL also expects to break the world record
for attendance to a hockey game, a record set
by the Big Chill at the Big House - the out-
door game between Michigan and Michigan
State in December 2010 last year with 104,173
in attendance. The NHL plans to sell about
115,000 tickets. From hosting major politi-
cians to record-breaking sporting events, the

University has demonstrated its versatility of
interests and has become a nationally recog-
nized institution.
Though the University is hosting the
Winter Classic, the NHL has assumed full
responsibility for the event and has already
stated that no student tickets will be sold.
Considering that the NHL has been court-
ing both Athletic Director Dave Brandon and
the regents for months, University officials
should have demanded that some tickets
be reserved for University students. Hope-
fully, most students will be too busy watch-
ing Michigan play in the Rose Bowl Game on
New Year's Day next year, but some students
would enjoy attending the Winter Classic
with reserved student seating.
As part of the $3 million contract, the Uni-
versity has decided to use one of its 12 one-
day liquor licenses for the Winter Classic.
This license means that beer will be served
throughout the stadium. Considering that
many students dream of the day when they
can openly drink a beer inside the Big House,
this element of the contract is yet another
plus for the University.
Partnering with the NHL to host the Winter
Classic allows our already nationally recog-
nized university to gain even more media cov-
erage. The event will also bring an economic
boost to the Ann Arbor area. The University
-should continue looking for opportunities like
the Winter Classic in coming years.

Congress currently holds an approv-
al rating of a mere 12 percent. And
a November 2011 Huffington Post
article headline jokingly reads: "Con-
gress Approval Rating Lower Than
Porn, Polygamy, BP Oil Spill, 'U.S.
Going Communist." Apparently
more Americans support polygamy
or an American turn to communism
more than our elected representa-
tives in Washington at the moment.
Taking just one look at the politi-
cal climate in Washington shows
why people may be fed up. The
politically-charged and hostile
atmosphere that dictates stale-
mates over everything isn't doing
much to, boost Congress' image.
The summer squabble over rais-
ing the nation's debt ceiling was
only the beginning, and it seems to
have set the tone for how all policy.
debates will go. Seeing this, it's not
only understandable but also inevi-
table that a majority of Americans
will be 'frustrated. Normally, I
would consider myself among those
88 or 90 percent - having a go at
the inefficiencies of our lawmakers
and continuously voicing my frus-
tration with the direction Congress
is heading.
But last summer - in the midst
of the heated debt ceiling standoff
- I spent a month in India. The con-
trast I saw between how government
works there and.how it works here

put things into perspective a bit. I'm
not saying that I've suddenly gained a
huge admiration for all the pointless
politicking that occurs in Washing-
ton, but there is something to be said
for the system we have set up and for
all its accomplishments.
While the development that India
has undergone in the last decade is
truly admirable, a quick trip down its
streets reveals much more work to
be done. I was greeted by on and off
electricity, unclean drinking water
in smaller, rural areas and half-
paved roads - if there were roads.
Big cities weren't much better: trash
littering the streets, backed-up rain-
water blocking roads and millions of
people living in poverty, without any
form of'government aid whatsoever.
What's surprising is that this wasn't
a war-torn nation or one stifled by
ruthless dictators, or even a nation
struggling to grow. This was India:
the world's largest democracy and
one of the fastest-growing econo-
mies in today's world.
A large portion of the blame for
these inconveniences and subpar
public services can be attributed to
shortcomings in the government.
Government officials are tangled in
large webs of lies and corruption.
Bribes are not only expected, but are
often required to get anything done,
starting from the lowest level of law
enforcement and ending at the very
top. People have long since given up
on government, accepting it as a dis-
tant entity that is there but hardly
ever accomplishes anything.
That is why the entire nation was
in an upswing over Anna Hazare.
Hazare is a 72-year-old Indian activ-
ist who led a 12-day hunger strike
lobbying against corruption. From
ordinary individuals on the streets to
big names in the Indian film industry,
everywhere I looked someone was
talking about Hazare. Every night
there were rallies and marches in his
support. 24/7 news cable networks
were tracking his every move. Indi-

an flags, hats and even wristbands
were being sold on every street cor-
ner "for Anna." Millions even fasted
alongside him to further the cause.
I've been going to India for the past
15 years, and never have I seen the
people of that nation so politically
involved and so invested in a cause.
What waseven more telling was their
desire to finally see the government
held accountable.
Appreciate what
our government
has achieved.
So yes, at the moment, Congress
has a historically low approval rating
of 10 to 12 percent. It's obvious that
we as Americans expect much more
from our lawmakers. And we should.
The rhetoric heard in Washington
these days is frustrating at least and
inconceivably petty at worst. And
after such a politically charged sum-
mer, many are fed up.
As Americans, we're not ones to
rest. We're always looking for the
next problem to solve, the next issue
to fight over and the next debate
to win. That's how it should be.
Still, there isn't any harm in taking
a moment every now and then to
appreciate what we have achieved.
Our government is by no means per-
fect - in fact nowadays, it's increas-
ingly easy to find faults. But the
government and political system that
we have is quite an accomplishment
in itself. Our government gets a lot
of things wrong, but the system we
have in place has also gotten a whole
lot right.

BRITTANY SMITH I
Everyone is at risk

One million first graders start public school
in Iran a week ahead of the rest of the students.
The first week of their educational careers is
spent playing, singing, dancing and remember-
ing those who gave their lives so that they may
live in peace and safety.
Like any other people, Iranians crave self-
rule, self-expression and a secure life in their
country. For more than a hundred years,
Iranians have been struggling to establish a
system of governance to protect their human
rights and secure their control over their nat-
ural resources.
It has been a bumpy ride.
The first democratically elected Iranian
government was overthrown by a CIA coup
in 1953.
What would the Middle East look like
today had it not been for U.S. interference?
Need I remind anyone of the destruction that
the U.S. and Israel have caused throughout
the Middle East?
After the CIA coup against Iran, the U.S.-
friendly Shah was installed and ruled with
an iron fist over the nation. The Israeli gov-
ernment oversaw the Shah's secret police
- SAVAK. Many Iranian students and free-
thinkers were arrested, imprisoned, tortured
and assassinated by SAVAK. This nightmare
continued for a quarter of a century, during
which the most valued thinkers of the nation
were systematically removed from civil soci-
ety. Many disappeared into the Shah's jails and
were never seen again.

This U.S./Israeli-backed dictatorship was
only overturned when a popular uprising in
1979 removed the Shah. However, the young
revolution was then militarily attacked by Sad-
dam Hussein, an Iraqi dictator who was sup-
ported by the United States and its allies. Eight
years of deadly war between Iran and Iraq fol-
lowed. This war left more than 1 million dead
and nearly destroyed Iran and Iraq, and shat-
tered the development of the two countries in
every sphere of life. On top of that destruction
was an additional 30 years of economic sanc-
tions against Iran. ,
Despite all of that, the Iranian civil societ-
ies - women's organizations, student orga-
nizations, unions and workers and teachers'
organizations - resumed their struggle after
the war to build the country according to their
visions for what Iran should look like. To this
day - against all odds - Iranians continue
to organize for their human rights, women's
rights and a better life for their children and
the elderly.
Any attack on Iran will destroy the delicate
fabric of a society that has tried again and again
to reach a representative governance to benefit
a nation of mostly children - 18 million Irani-
ans are under 14 years of age.
If you value humanity and human rights, say
no to any attack on Iran.
Mozhgan Savabieasfahani is a Ph.D. visiting
scholar in the School of Public Health.

It's often said that the University is a microcosm of
the world. In many ways - with national attention given
to our local debates, like the racialization of affirmative
action or the University's roles in impacting the future of
Detroit - that couldn't be more true. But when attending
to these issues, our world gets more sound bites than the
realities that confront our community, particularly as it
relates to the status of identity.
Locally, students are bombarded with billboards,
campus signs, digital posters and campus dialogues that
address the range of identities of our student community,
or at least the need to evaluate them. A lot of the public-
ity given to increased awareness around matters that
highlight identity deal with questions that involve the
ideas and leadership that would make the University a
safe space for students. Having such an environment is
thought by many school administrators, especially the
Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs, to be required.
MESA explores the appreciation for identity and status
with as much intellectual vitality as the commitment of
students who are willing to dedicate their engagement.
,Though the constant images that students receive around
campus are indeed supportive, they are no lessconfusing.
Take, for example, sexual health.
Bulletin boards in residential halls scream "diversity
matters" or hand-held pledges given across campus that
honor sexual health awareness often provoke students
to get more involved in knowing their sexual health sta-
tus. These campaigns are often very ambitious. They ask
students to survey their health with quick and easy tests
or seek counseling for preventable measures that can
be taken as a precaution against incurable diseases, like
HIV/AIDS. Yet, current societal conditions make it dif-
ficult for students to act responsibly.
The media uses advertisements to convince young
adults - especially college-aged students - to know
their status for sexually transmitted diseases but has
not yet resolved the circumstances that objectify people
who actually know their status, or who feel comfortable
advocating for people to do the same. The name-calling,
gossiping or isolation felt in churches, families or places
of employment is an unfortunate reality for some people
who test positive for a sexually transmitted disease. Cir-
cumstances such as these challenge the idea of college
students all over this country, and in our own commu-

nity, to have their status revealed through a blood test.
So, what are our choices?
Noticeably, our choices aren't as varied as the names
of sexually transmitted diseases. However, there are
options. The one that I favor most is the option to live.
I mentioned earlier that the University lives in the
image of this world; just like our world, it is highly *
responsive to the choices that people make - beit pollu-
tion with the threat of global warming, or the responsibil-
ity that students take in their sexual health. But different
than our world are the University's support and limit-
less resources that students can find and engage in when
understanding what it means to have sex responsibly, or
how to offset potentially more disastrous situations if,
perhaps, your status is positive.
MESA helps students consider these issues and poten-
tially re-frame them. On campus, our reality includes
knowing or hearing about certain students' names get-
ting slandered for their presumed promiscuity, but still
expecting them to get tested. Given the rumors, it may
seem safer for that student to not know the truth.
Indeed, it is very hard to figure out which message
is right: the message that you hear from MESA - that
knowing your status can save a life - the one in our
communities - where the experience of living in iso-
lation might be real for someone whose test came out
positive - or living a life in fear - not knowing when
and with whom it's OK to talk about your status. The
stigma, the shame and silence are all facts of life that
do exist. But MESA's advocacy to share in that journey
with students in identifying support groups on cam-
pus, or spreading the message about the importance
of getting tested be understood through terms that
may resonate with students lifestyles, indicates that
MESA's weekly testing is more than a campaign for
social causes.
Each Tuesday between 6 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., MESA's
testing service is administered in room 2202 of the Mich-
igan Union with a sense of follow-up that makes it a viable
option for students. Not only is MESA raising awareness
by providing a weekly testing service in their office, but
they are also helping students find their voice once they
know what to say.

Tunes for a date-less day

ast time I checked the

the Mother Waddles scrap heap.
But I've got the family van for

so I'm happy
to say pop

taking a look

1. Kelly Clarkson - "Stronger

I prefer my Kelly to brood.
But she's got to put out a limp-

what's otherwise a P!nk throw-
away and some patronizing.
aphorisms. I just want my Kelly
to brood. But it's not about what
I want, is it?
. 2. Adele- "Set Fire to the
Rain (Live at the Royal Albert
Hall)"
It's nice to have someone in
the pop top-10 who has a thumb
casually flipped up the ass of
thin-voiced-"diva"-waifery, but
Adele is particularly barren on
"Fire." This track ain't trans-
forming elements - not with
those violins, not with a mlody
this dull. But there are those
nice shrieks gnarled inside it
like tiny splinters, and I do relish
her "oooh,s. They're quite good.
Otherwise, she's anemic as ever.
3. Flo Rida - "Good Feeling"
It's remarkable how far into
space I can stare once Flo begins
to rap. Flo's flow is so economical
and unobtrusive, it's like a sheet
of printer paper taped to white
wall. LL Cool J's effervescence
is clawing at this song's surface,
aspiring for reincarnation, only
to find that it chose the wrong
religion.
4. Rihanna - "We Found
Love"
Live and die by the club, in the
club, at the club. Are you at the
club? We're headed to the club.
We're at the club. Are you in the
club? We're not leaving the club.
We'll never leave the club. You
should come to the club. There's
a $5 cover, though.
5. David Guetta ft. Nicki Minaj
"Turn Me On"
This is Nicki's shot as a house
diva, since, well, she'll do any-
thing, really. Guetta's too clini-
cal to let her loose so "Turn Me
On" functions as incongruous
* pastiche somewhere near the
partnering of Giorgio Moroder
and Donna Summer. But when
Summer felt love, she didn't need
to ask for anybody's help. And
she certainly didn't care if you
danced or not.
6. Jessie J - "Domino"

Repugnant, shrill and effort-
lessly joyless. Jessie's plastic
ebullience is not only grating,
it's condescending. Her chafing
vocalese, spilled over this Katy
Perry B-side, is particularly
graceless. "I'm feeling sexy and
free" she says. Jessie, please,
show. Don't tell.
7. Tyga - "Rack City"
I like the pervy, acid bass-
line on "City" and its generally
flimsy infrastructure, butI don't
feel much like living in it. What
made New Boyz' "You're a Jerk"
("Rack"'s louche partner-in-
dread) great was humor in col-
laboration with all the bleakness.
But Tyga's funny bone seems to
have fallen asleep on the armrest
of Young Money's tour bus as it
rolled into town.
Listening to
pop music is
always better
in a van.
8. Snoop Dogg & WizKhalifa
ft. Bruno Mars - "Young Wild
And Free"
Why hasn't this happened
yet? Snoop and Khalifa, spiritu-
ally, are like peanut butter and
peanut butter. They can riff on
weed for three minutes, play golf
together, loiter around 7-Elev-
ens. "Wild and Free" may strike
some as willful insouciance, but
it's more tragic. "So what we get
drunk / So what we smoke weed
/ We're just having fun / We
don't care who sees / So what we
go out / That's howeit's supposed
to be."
"Living young and wild and
free" is a chorus that might
ring obtuse, but it's pleading
"why not?" We know what you
expect of us, but why should we
accept? This is what youth is
about, right? Can we live inside
a dream, can we chase a high
without ever coming down and
never dietFabulous, heartbreak-
ing tragedy. Pretty boring oth-
erwise.
9. LMFAO - "Sexy And I
Know It"
In which a joke is no longer
fuwrny, in which a laugh becomes
the slyest expression of pity,
in which nobody escapes from
complete and utter misogyny.
LMFAO's shtick is buried in
ritualistic buggery. These mooks
deserve a pardoning pat on the
behind and a designated drive
home.
10. Bruno Mars - "It Will
Rain"
See Adele, she'llhelp out.
Dimuzio is in the club.

A Valentine's Day
soundtrack for all
the singletons
By JULIA SMITH-EPPSTEINER
Daily Arts Writer
Where is the love? Not in Hall-
mark cards or in fancy Valentine's
dinners that encapsulate one per-
son's love for another, but in the
beats that get you through the
daily grind of a Tuesday.
One important tip: Do your best
to prevent Etta James's love goo
from dripping into your ears on
this special day. As unrivaled in
splendor as tunes like "The Very
Thought of You" and "The Man
I Love" are, they may just lead to
increased consumption of Ben &
Jerry's Half Baked.
Here we are, discovering the
art of sticking it to Cupid. Wheth-
er you're flying solo because of
overzealous behavior, a busy
schedule, the "emo-roco" (emo-
tion rollercoaster) state of your
last relationship or you are unsuc-
cessfully playing the no-game
game - a catchy phrase that
means absolutely not trying and
getting laid because of it - this
playlist, titled Get At Me, is made
for you.
You may consult last year's
V-Day special, lullabyes for get-
ting laid, if that's the red-roses
place you're in. But if not, here's
an alternative that will put an
endless spring in your step in an
I-love-life fashion. Jam to the
following 14 songs and feel gold,
gold, golden today.
"Velvet Elvis (RAC Remix)"
by Alex Winston hooks you

ARISTA

"I see you drivin' round town wih the girl I love, and I'm like ... OK."

with Winston's stinging voice
and follows up with an intense
infatuation due to the endorphin-
emitting beats 'n' bells.
"It Could Be" by Ella Riot rocks
out, lifting your soul into a breezy
funk made possible by the local-
ly rooted sensation previously
known as My Dear Disco.
"NeedYour Love (feat. RayDal-
ton)" by Sol invites a somewhat
opposing theme to what I've been
discussing, based on the track's
title, but this song is an essential
item in a grooving toolbox.
"Feel Like I Do" by Vanilla
drops us off in the British '90s and
leaves us desiring to stay forever.
"Sun Is Shining (Techno
Remix)" by Bob Marley delivers
an electronic-reggae moment that
will surely get you craving that
natural Vitamin D.
"The Dream (Prod. By The Offi-

cial)" by Logic somehow makes
you feel on top of your world even
when you're absolutely not.
"Fool for You (feat. Phillip Bai-
ley)" by Cee Lo Green warms your
insides with soulful bellow.
"Mr. Quiche" by Wildcat! Wild-
cat! masters synthesizers well
enough to teach synthology. A
hats-off to the three wildcats of
L.A. for blending synths, percus-
sion and vocals into an exhilarat-
ingly luxurious track.
"Got to Get You Off My Mind"
by Solomon Burke preaches just
right.
"Pa Pa Power" by Dead Man's
Bones indulges in a haunting but
empowering aura createdby Ryan
Gosling, Zach Fields and a choir of
children. I wasn't aware Gosling
could become more desirable, but
oh, he can.
"Sister Wife . (Star Slinger

Remix)" by Alex Winston. Whoa.
"Dogwalkers of the New Age"
by Breathe Owl Breathe lives a
more down-tempo life than other
tracks on this playlist, but the
band of Michiganders gets into
a blissful groove that makes you
shake loose.
"Up Up Up" by GIVERS wel-
comes a dip, skip and jive into the
carefree summertime disposition
that this Louisianan quintet of
young musicians presents.
"Dance, Dance, Dance" by
Lykke Li plays, and you just can't
stop shakin' that booty.
GetAt Me, designed to improve
your mood no matter how elevat-
ed it began, is all about musical
love affairs getting you through
the day. Whatever today is about
for you, engage these 14 upbeat
tunes and celebrate it - happy
days!

Mysterious 'River'

ABC's new fantasy
drama delivers in
the wake of 'Lost'
By RADHIKA MENON
For the Daily
When "Lost" debuted in 2004,
it was hailed for its revolution-
ary plotline and its crossover of
mystery and
sci-fi genres: TV
had never seen
anything like it. The River
Now two years
after the end Pilot
of "Lost," "The Tuesdaysat9 p.m.
River" picks up
the pieces it left ABC
behind, com-
plete with a mysterious island in
the Amazon and a shifty monster
driving the main cast to misery.
Though the plotline bears an
uncanny resemblance to that
of "Lost," "The River" can be
deemed a worthy successor and
not just a carbon copy. The new
venture from Oren Peli, cre-
ator of "Paranormal Activity,"
relies on "found footage," quick
cuts and documentary-style
format. "The River" is undeni-
ably a hybrid between "Lost"
and "Paranormal Activity," yet
somehow, it works.
Dr. Emmet Cole (Bruce Green-
wood, "Star Trek"), a legendary
nature explorer who is beloved by
much of the world for his famed
television show, goes missing in
the Amazon. After six months of
searching, he is declared dead ...
that is, until his emergency bea-
con goes off.
His wife Tess (Leslie Hope,
"24") and his reluctant son Lin-
coln (Joe Anderson, "Across the
Universe") travel to the Amazon
in search of the lost man with a
camera crew and Lincoln's child-
hood friend Lena (newcomer
Eloise Mumford) in tow. They
encounter unseen supernatu-
ral forces native to the island of

"I think we're lost."
La Boinna, barely managing to
escape alive.
The complicated dynamic
between Lincoln and his parents
begins to play out in the two-
hour premiere. Emmet is loved by
masses of people, but to Lincoln
he is just an absent father. Lin-
coln is noticeably hesitant in con-
tinuing the search and correctly
identifies Tess's motivation as
guilt about an affair. Flashbacks
to Lincoln's childhood show that
Emmet cared deeply for his son,
but the call of nature's magic and
mystery were too great for him to
ignore.
The supporting cast mem-
bers are also compelling. Jahel
Valenzuela (Paulina Gaitan,
"Sin Nombre") is a young girl
capable of communicating with
the mysteries of the island.
She is able to channel Emmet's
spirit in a creepy sleepwalking
sequence reminiscent of "Para-
normal Activity." Clark Quietly
(Paul Blackthorne, Bollywood's
"Lagaan"), the producer of
Emmet Cole's show, is known to
butt heads with Cole. Their rela-
tionship is reminiscent of Jack
and Locke - one's a skeptic and
the other's a believer.
But as "Lost" fans watched
the island with a mind of its own
develop into a character in itself,
"The River" doesn't offer a par-
allel universe. The island of La

Boinna doesn't bring much in
terms of complexity and mystery
beyond the unknown monster.
Where there were polar bears
and hatches, there are now simply
leaves and soil, leaving audiences
intrigued about the search for
Emmet Cole but less so about the
island and its secrets.
As a two-hour installment,
the premiere was exciting and
gripping. Mystery drove the
plot, intriguing the audience
with secrets left unexplained.
There were complex characters
with complex relationships and
a promise of answers in subse-
quent episodes. Though a two-
episode debut for a show that
was promised only eight epi-
sodes is risky, ABC has shown
belief in and commitment to
the midseason replacement for
"Dancing with the Stars."
At its core, "The River" is based
on magic and mystical happen-
ings: Skeptics and non-believers
should stay clear. Though the
style and theme seem to be adapt-
ed from its predecessors, "The
River" is able to meshthe two into
a refreshing and exciting show.
As Emmet Cole would say,
"There's magic out there." And
he's right. "The River" is proving
itself to be a major contender in
the sci-fi arena, fitting nicely into
the "Lost"-shaped hole in all of
our hearts.

Beilein credits 'swag,' hot
shooting for bench success

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Junior forward A.J. Treais scored three goals during last weekend's series split against Michigan State.
Michigan capitalizing on
offensive odd-man rushes

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
The No. 5 Michigan hockey
team has run the drill for about
two months now. They ran it on
Tuesday, even though the short-
ened afternoon practice left time
for just a few select drills.
The drill is simple and the
framework familiar. Two Michi-
gan forwards skate up the ice
with one defender in between.
The objective, as always, is to
score.
No, not groundbreaking stuff,
but there's a small wrinkle the
Wolverines added that says a
lot about why this team has
improved in the second half of
the season:
"(Berenson) just says you have
to pass it early," said junior for-
ward A.J. Treais.
This small focus point has
received a significant deal of
attention this season, and it has
begun to pay dividends.
In the early part of the season,
Michigan struggled mightily on
odd-man rushes. On some two-
on-ones or two-on-nones, the
attacking Wolverines would play
a game of hot potato and fail to
shoot.
"We've had trouble with those
rushes, so we put some differ-
ent points of emphasis in there,"
Berenson said. "Even last year,
look at Carl (Hagelin) and (Matt)

Rust, how many two-on-ones
they had. They never scored
until we finally told them what
to do."
In the Notre Dame series
just three weeks ago, two of
Michigan's most prolific scorers,
junior forward Chris Brown and
freshman forward Alex Gup-
till, seemed lost on a rush, what
should be one of the game's easi-
est scoring situations.
Withno defenders inthe vicin-
ity, Brown passed to Guptill, who
passed back to Brown, and so
on. Eventually, Brown passed to
Guptill near the crease, but the
puck was just out of reach. The
duo didn't even muster a shot.
Flash forward to the series
with Michigan State this past
weekend. Junior forward A.J.
Treais scored three times in the
series, twice on odd-man rushes.
On each, his linemates, freshman
forward Phil Di Giuseppe and
senior forward Luke Glendening,
made the pass early.
"If you make the pass early,
that lane's there," Treais said. "If
you keep waiting toward the net,
those lanes close.
"Me and Glendening are start-
ing to jell a little bit better. He
kind of knows where I am with-
out looking. On that second goal,
I was flying up the ice pretty late,
and he just heard one 'hey, I'm
here,' and he threw it to the area
and I was there."

Converting players like Treais
into scorers has been a major
accomplishment for Berenson.
Brown said the team used to look
to fake the shot then pass, when
it should be thinking the oppo-
site.
But changing the way some
players approach the game
entails more than just improv-
ing Iheir hockey skills. Treais,
for example, may have the most
offensive talent on the team, but
he is also the most laid back.
Off the ice, that makes for a
friendly teammate. On the ice, it
can become a liability.
"He needs to be fiery," Beren-
son said. "He needs to be abra-
sive. He needs to be hungry. He
needs to be into it. And if he is,
he's a different player.
"We have players that won't
shoot. Shoot the puck. A.J. would
rather not shoot the puck, and
now we've got him shooting the
puck, and look It the difference."
Berenson cautions that the
Wolverines' transition offense
remains a work in progress.
As recently as Monday, Brown
and others received an earful
from the coaching staff during
film study for committing errors
on a rush.
"I was kind of the brunt of that
for a little bit," Brown said. "You
can see yourself - if you have
a chance to shoot; you need to
shoot."

Michigan coach John Beilein
didn't necessarily foresee sopho-
more forward Evan Smotrycz
breaking out of his slump Sunday
against Illinois.
Smotrycz, who entered the
game shooting an abysmal 23.5
percent from 3-point range,
wasn't even shooting well in prac-
tice throughout the week.
But Beilein saw something,
prompting him to believe
Smotrycz might've been primed
to reverse his downward trend.
"I just noticed Evan ... really
had a good week of practice with-
out a lot of success," Beilein said.
"He didn't shoot the ball particu-
larly well, but his energy was tre-
mendous. I think he understands
that if things are going tough for
you, a positive attitude is essen-
tial, and he's really had that this
week."
Smotrycz scored 12 first-half
points, making Beilein look'like a
smart man.
"We have been waiting for
that, and you all have been wait-
ing for that," Beilein joked to the
media. "We needed that, and it
was almost like a shot in the arm.
It propelled our defense and (gave
us) a little bit of a lead."
Against Nebraska last Wednes-
day, Smotrycz's poor shooting in
practice, combined with a strong
performance from redshirt soph-
omore forward Jordan Morgan,
resulted in the Reading, Mass.
native playing just 13 minutes. His
limited action off the bench was a
far cry from December, when he
was a starter averaging nearly a
double-double.
But while Smotrycz was rid-
ing the pine in Lincoln, his bench
mate, junior guard Matt Vogrich,
was busy breaking out of a slump
of his own. Vogrich entered the
contest shooting 30 percent from
long range, butin just 11 minutes,
he lit up the Bob Devaney Sports
Center with three 3-pointers.
Beilein chose-to ride the hot
shooting of his guard on Sunday,
giving Vogrich u8 minutes of play
time - just three short his sea-
son-high, which came in a blow-
out over Arkansas Pine-Bluff.
Once again, Beilein's coach-
ing instincts proved correct, as
Vogrich knocked down all three

Michigan coach John Beilein is encouraged by the bench players' improverent.

of his field goals, including two
3-pointers.
"It's really good to see him
going, because he's such a good
shooter," said senior guard Zack
Novak. "The fact that he hadn't
made a lot was kind of puzzling.
We knew that he was so much
better than that, and he's show-
ing what kind of player he really
is right now."
Added Beilein: "We had Matt
come off (the bench) with some
swagger. He doesn't get many
shots in the game, (but he still
came) off with swagger."
The bench' - which has
been particularly quiet while
Smotrycz and Vogrich slumped
and sophomore forward Jon
Horford remained sidelined
with an injury - came up "huge"
in Novak's eyes.
The bench's emergence
couldn't have come at a better
time. Morgan picked up his sec-
and foul early in the first half,
forcing him to sit for almost 17
minutes of the opening stanza.
Novak later found himself in foul
trouble, so the bench was relied
upon to fend off the Fighting
Illini.
"That's all I talked about (in
the locker room) because that
was badly needed," Beilein said.
"It gives us a lot of extra minutes

that you hope that you prove to
be valuable at this time of the
year."
Illinois flooded the post and
forced Morgan off the floor -
a tactic Michigan will likely
encounter in postseason play.
Smotrycz's strong play, along
with Vogrich's ability to score in
bunches, instilled confidence in
their teammates.
"I'm definitely better at stay-
ing out of foul trouble than I was
last year, but you're going to have
games like that," Morgan said.
"You're going to have games
where your starters are going to
be in foul trouble and you need to
be able to have people come off
the bench, like Matt Vogrich and
Evan Smotrycz, that are going to
pick your team up."
Smotrycz and Vogrich were
joined by sophomore guard
Tim Hardaway Jr., who also
caught fire over the weekend.
The Wolverines are seeming-
ly firing on all cylinders, and
doing so at the right time, with
March just around the corner.
Beilein offered a race glimpse
at the future, should Michigan's
reserves continue to play like
they did this past weekend.
"If we get that type of bench
production, we can keep win-
ning at a pretty high pace."

'M' winning streak snapped

By KYLE SAUKAS
For the Daily
It was a lopsided affair on
Saturday afternoon in Seattle,
where the Michigan men's ten-
nis team lost to Washington.
The Wolverines' first competi-
tion on the road also spelled the
end of their
three-game MICHIGAN 1
win streak. WASHINGTON 6
Michi-
gan (4-3) couldn't catch a break
in the first five singles matches
and eventually fell to the Hus-
kies (5-2) by a 6-1 margin.
Michigan coach Bruce Berque
said the Wolverines ran into a
wall against a motivated Wash-
ington team that was coming off
a tough 4-3 loss against Boise
State.
"I think the biggest difference
in the match is that Washington
played very, very well," Berque
said. "They were coming off a
disappointing loss, which made
them really eager to play this
match."
The match was also the first
true road test for many players
on the team, and without home-
court advantage, the team that
had performed well in a com-
petitive early schedule seemed
to lose its edge.
"I think that we have to be a
little tougher," Berque said. "I
felt like we had a little bit more
softness in this match. It was
the first true road match for our
guys, though. You know, it was a
great experience for them to go
through."
The Wolverines had a disap-
pointing day across the board,
losing five singles points from
the get-go and dropping the dou-
bles point on losses in the No. 2
and 3 doubles positions. The sole

point for Michigan came from
sophomore Barrett Franks's
singles victory over Washing-
ton's No. 5 position player, Max
Manthou.
For Michigan, the true high-
light of Saturday's match was
the performance of the duo of
junior Evan King and sopho-
more Shaun Bernstein, which
continued to dominate at No. 1
doubles. The pair, ranked No. 22
nationally, topped Huskies Kyle
McMorrow and Emmet Egger by
a score of 9-8.
"The consistency, at this
point, is the most important
thing," Berque said. "Evan is a
junior now, and I think that hav-
ing been through two full sea-
sons of college tennis, I think
that he realizes now that (con-
sistency) is the key. (Consisten-
cy) is just in Shaun's nature."
Michigan will need to be con-

sistently tougher throughout the
rest of its future schedule, espe-
cially against its next opponent,
Notre Dame. Though the Wol-
verines will regain home-court
advantage against the Fighting
Irishon Saturday, they will again
be playing a highly ranked oppo-
nent. Yet this has been common
for the squad, which has played
six of the top-50 ranked teams
in its first seven competitions of
the 2012 season.
Overall, the Wolverines are
still enthusiastic to play these
challenging matches, but Coach
Berque knows it will be a tough
competition, and his team needs
to be prepared.
"We have always had real-
ly close matches with Notre
Dame," Berque said. "It's always
a war. I think we are just going
to need a full-team effort. It's
going to be a great match."

It's taken three years, but
Michigan quarterback Denard
Robinson finally has a love song.
And just
in time for First seen on
Valentine's -the game
Day.
Titled "I Love You Denard,"
the song speaks to the plight of
a typical Michigan fan who has
lived through the heart-wrench-
ing collapses prior to Robinson's
resurrection of the Michigan
dynasty. It is both uplifting and
tear jerking. Funny and truthful.
Pat Stansik, a former Michigan
club lacrosse player and aspir-
ing comedian, known for recent
smash hit "Bros vs. Hipsters", put
together a tribute to Robinson.,'
Stansik, who wrote the lyrics,
began writing the song a year
ago when he was too busy with
school and lacrosse to complete
his vision. He contacted Mind's
