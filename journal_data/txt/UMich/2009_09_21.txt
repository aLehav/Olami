Fairchild embarks
on journey raising
money to fight MS
By A. BRAD SCHWARTZ
Daily StaffReporter
University alum Joe Fairchild
arrived in Ann Arbor last Tuesday
for what could have been a simple
four-day visit. Only, rather than
arriving by car, bus or Amtrak train,
Fairchild walked into town pushing
the modified baby stroller he's been
living out of since early August.
Fairchild's stop in AnnArbor was
a briefrespite from his months-long
journey across the United States, a
fundraising effort to raise money

for multiple sclerosis, an autoim-
mune disease that attacks the cen-
tral nervous system.
A graduate of the class of 2006,
Fairchild started to seriously pur-
sue running when he came to
college, inspired by his younger
brother, who was then running
track in high school.
Last May, having not run seri-
ously for some time, Fairchild real-
ized he needed to challenge himself
and soon called his brother.
"(My brother) was talking about
training for another (marathon),"
Fairchild said, "and he said, 'We
should run across the country or
something like that,' almost as a
joke."
The more Fairchild thought

Through profs' eyes: What's
happening in Afghanistan?

Editor's Note: Today the Daily debuts
a new series, "OfflceHours,"in which
we sit down with experts on campus
to discuss important stories of the
day. The goal of the series, which will
runperiodically throughout the year,
is to distill current affairs and events
into their most significant parts
through quotes and explanations
from these experts. We begin with
last month's much-disputed Afghan
presidential elections.
By DARRYN FITZGERALD
Daily Staff Reporter
Afghanistan's presidential elec-
tions were held over a month ago.
But a winner has still not been
announced among the three top
contenders, incumbent President
Hamid Karzai, former Foreign
Minister Abdullah Abdullah and
RamazanBashardost. Instead, accu-
sations of voter fraud and other dis-
crepancies have swirled, serving
only to compligte and destabilize an
already confusing and delicate situa-
tion. Because of the controversy, the
country's United Nations-backed
Electoral Complaints Commission
has recently begun the process of
recounting and investigating about
10 percent of polling places to find
evidence ofballet-box stuffing,

As these events unfold, The Mich-
igan Daily sat down with four of the
University's top Middle East experts
to try and make sense of it all.
Juan Cole, professor of Middle
Eastern and South Asian History at
the University, said the election was
at first seen as an exit strategy for
the United States from its involve-'
ment in the country. Without a
stable Afghan government with
the power to control the Taliban,
though, the United States can't end
its military occupation, Cole said.
But because the election has
been destabilizing, Cole said, the
U.S. occupation in the country will
only be prolonged.
"The election has turned into a
full-scale fiasco for Washington,"
he said.
The Independent Election
Commission of Afghanistan ini-
tially reported that Hamid Karzai
received the majority of the vote
with 54.6 percent, beating out
Afghanistan's former Foreign Min-
ister Abdullah Abdullah, who gar-
nered 27.8 percent of the vote.
Cole said that, although Karzai's '
majority implies he should be the
new president, if the Afghanistan
Electoral Complaints Commission
determines there was voter fraud,
a runoff will be held.

Election officials have said that
the current recount could last as
long as three months.
History Profs. Ronald Suny and
Jonathan Marwil argue that the
United States cared more about the
transparency of the election and
the end goal of transferring power
than the actual results.
"Either (candidate) would have

U of Minnesota administers breath tests to fansI EMPOWERED WITH PEACE

In an effort to combat dronken
behavior at University of Minne-
sota football games, the school has
implemented a new policy requir-
ing stodents who get kicked ot of a
game to pass an alcohol breath test
before the next game, according to
The Associated Press.
The program, called Check BAG,
was inspired by a similar policy
introdoced at the University of
Wisconsin five years ago. Accord-
ing to the AP, the role applies to
all of the school's 10,000 student
season-ticket holders.
Minnesota Vice Provost for Stu-
dent Affairs Jerry Reinhart told
the AP that the intention was not
to make trooble for every stodent
who consumes alcohol before the
game.
"If people come in with a buzz
on - there will be tailgating -
that's fine as long as their behavior
doesn't interfere with those aroond
them," he said.

NOTRE DAME TO DISSOLVE
HETERODOX SIDE OF
ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT
The University of Notre Dame
plans to end an experiment that cre-
ated two economics departments,
The Chronicle of Higher Education
reported.
University leaders accepted the
schism in 2003 after "a long series of
quarrels over methods and ideology.'
One faction of faculty members
wentto Economics and Policy Studies,
"a heterodox department that made
room for post-Keynesians, Marxians
and historians of economic thought,"
the Chronicle reported. Heterodox
views stray from an acknowledged
standard.
The others went to Economics and
Econometrics, "a more mainstream
department with an emphasis on
quantitative tools."
University officials said what start-
ed as an experiment has now clearly

failed, and they plan to dissolve the
"heterodox" department within two
years.
STUDENTS IN BEIJING PROTEST
DETENTION OF TEACHER
About 100 students assembled out-
side a Beijing police bureau yesterday
to protest the detention of a lecturer
and demand his release, The Associ-
ated Press reported.
The lecturer, Ding Xiaoping, was
a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen dem-
onstrations. He teaches at several uni-
versities.
Recent graduate Yu Zhiwei said
Deng had been taken Saturday after-
noon because the government saw
him as a threat to the upcoming cel-
ebration of the Communist republic's
60oth anniversary.
"He was taken away for political
reasons. The police want to limit his
activity," Yu said.

LANSING, Mich.
Michigan police
ask residents to
monitor marijuana
Law enforcement officials
want outdoor enthusiasts in
Michigan to be alert for possible
marijuana growing and harvest-
ing operations this fall.
The Michigan Domestic Can-
nabis Eradication and Suppres-
sion Program says fall hunting
seasons bring more people into
the woods, making it more like-
ly someone will spot marijuana
being grown or harvested.
Officials say to watch for
unusual amounts of traffic; use
of camping equipment or rec-
reational vehicles on wooded*
property with no evidence of rec-
reational activities; and patrolled
or guarded woods or swamps.
Other signs include large
amounts of PVC piping, irriga-
tion hoses or plastic planters in
heavily wooded areas.
SPOKANE, Wash.
Killer escapes from
organized field trip
A helicopter clattered over
transient camps and rail yards
in the expanding search for an
insane killer as investigators tried
to determine whether he planned
his getaway from a field trip orga-
nized by a mental hospital.
Phillip Arnold Paul left little
clothing in his room at East-
ern State Hospital and carried a
backpack and $50 from a Social
Security check when he vanished
Thursday at the Spokane County
International Fair, sheriff's Sgt.
Dave Reagan said.
The field trip to the fair, which
included 30 other patients, is
an annual event that Paul easily
could have anticipated, Reagan
told The Spokesman-Review
newspaper.
Because of the extra cloth-
ing Paul had, it's reasonable
to assume he has changed his
appearance, Reagan said.
Paul, 47, was committed after
he was diagnosed as schizo-
phrenic and acquitted by rea-
son of insanity in the slaying of
an elderly woman in Sunnyside,
Wash., in 1987. He soaked her
body in gasoline to throw off
search dogs.
KHARTOUM, Sudan
r Sudan claims
victories in Darfur
The Sudanese army said yes-
terday it has cleared several more
areas of rebel control in North
Darfur province ahead of peace
talks set for October. Rebels de-
nied the government claims.
The state news agency quoted
the military saying it had target-
ed in particular the Sudan Liber-
ation Army of exiled rebel leader
Abdelwahid Elnur, the largest
rebel movement.
There was no word about ca-
sualties, only that the army had
"purged the areas of the rem-

nants" of the rebels.
The government claims could
not be independently verified.
They follow rebel reports of in-
tense fighting in the area starting
Thursday. SLA members said at
least three of their fighters were
r killed and many civilians were
displaced.
HAVANA, Cuba
Cuba peace concert
attracts thousands
Hundreds' of thousands of
Cubans flocked to sprawling
Revolution Plaza yesterday for
an open-air "peace concert"
headlined by Colombian rocker
Juanes, an event criticized by
some Cuban-Americans who say
the performers are lending sup-
port to the island's communist
government simply by showing
up.
Organizers say they expect
as many as half a million people
to attend the four-hour concert
under a broiling Havana sun,
making the Colombian heart-
throb's visit the biggest by an
outsider since Pope John Paul
Il's 1998 tour.
Hundreds of public buses fer-
ried young and old to the concert
site, and the government laid on
even more transportation, hop-
ing for a large turnout.
Most concertgoers wore white
- to symbolize peace - and some
held up signs reading "Peace
on Earth" and "We Love You
Juanes."

Obama says Russia not
reason for defense cuts

President questioned
after eliminating
missile defense
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama sharply dis-
misses criticism that Russian
opposition influenced his deci-
sion to scrap a European missile
defense system, calling it merely
a bonus if the leaders of Russia
end up "a little less paranoid"
about the U.S.
"My task here was not to nego-
tiate with the Russians," Obama
told CBS' "Face the Nation" in an
interview for broadcast yesterday.
"The Russians don't make deter-
minations about what our defense
posture is."
The president's comments were
his first on the matter since he
abruptly announced on Thurs-

day that he was scuttling plans to
deploy 10 missile interceptors in
Poland and a related radar in the
Czech Republic. That shield had
been proposed under President
George W. Bush.
Russia condemned it is a threat
to its security despite years of U.S.
assurances to the contrary.
In its place will be a different
missile-defense plan relying on
a network of sensors and inter-
ceptor missiles based at sea, on
land and in the air. Obama says
that adapts to the most pressing
threat from Iran to U.S. troops
and allies in Europe, potential
attacks by short- and medium-
range missiles.
Yet athome and abroad,Obama's
decision immediately raised a
political question of whether it
was done in part to appease Rus-
sia and win its help in other areas,
mainly in confronting the poten-

tial of a nuclear-armed Iran. That
point was underscored when Rus-
sia lauded the change.
To Sen. Lindsey Graham, a
South Carolina Republican who
is on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, "This is going to be
seen as a capitulation to the Rus-
sians, who had no real basis to
object to what we were doing. And-
at the end of the day you emipow-
ered the Russians, you made Iran
happy and you made the people in
Eastern Europe wonder who we
are as Americans."
In the CBS interview taped Fri-
day, Obama was pressed on why he
did not seek anything in exchange
from Russia.
"Russia had always been para-
noid about this, but George Bush
was right. This wasn't a threat
to them," Obama said. "And this
program will not be a threat to
them."

Paterson will run in
2010 despite White
House opposition
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov.
David Paterson isn't scrapping
his plans to run for the office he
inherited 18 months ago, despite
growing pressure from Washing-
ton and intervention by the Rev.
Al Sharpton, who has contact-
ed the governor and the White
House over his concern.
"My plans for 2010 are to run
for governor of the state of New
York," Paterson said yesterday
after serving as grand marshal
to the African-American Day
Parade in Manhattan. "I am run-
ning for office."
Paterson's remarks come amid
mounting pressure from Wash-
ington and within New York to
drop out because of his low poll
numbers and concerns from
other Democrats that he might
hurt their chances in 2010.
"I think the White House is
very concerned about 2010," said
Lee Miringoff of the Marist Col-
lege poll, which last week found
Paterson mired in some of the
lowest approval ratings of any
New York governor.
"They are worried that Pat-

erson's pick for the U.S. Sen-
ate, (Kirsten) Gillibrand, might
be vulnerable," Miringoff said.
"Theyare also worried they might
lose that seat and they want the
head of the ticket to be stronger
than Paterson's numbers are."
Asked if he was concerned
about losing some Democratic
support because of his low poll
numbers, Paterson said: "No,
I feel like in this very difficult
economic time, just about all the
governors are facing the same
types of problems."
But the signals from Wash-
ington Democrats may be what
Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo, riding high in the polls,
needs to increase fundraising
for a possible run for governor.
Cuomo has refused to challenge
Paterson so far and has declined
to say if he will seek the job held
by New York's first black and
legally blind governor.
"The White House is giving
Cuomo all the political cover he
needs to get in this," Miringoff
said.
In addition to governor, every
statewide office and the major-
ity of state Senate seats will be
decided in the 2010 elections.
A Cuomo spokesman wouldn't
respond to requests for comment
yesterday.

Life without justice
Prevalence of teenagers given life sentences a travesty
There are 10,944 inmates in Michigan, and 346 are serv-
ing a life sentence without parole for crimes committed as
teenagers, according to the state Department of Correc-
tions. A recent study by the University of Texas cites Michigan as
the second-highest number of juveniles serving life without parole
in the country. This alarming statistic reflects a fundamental injus-
tice in the state's corrections system, and news that the legislature
may ban such practices could not have come soon enough. Michi-
gan's excessive number of teens facing life sentences is appalling
and must be corrected by either state law or favorable Supreme
Court rulings in two crucial cases.

bills relating to the University of Texas's
findings. The bills would abolish life-with-
out-parole sentences for offenders under
18 years old or commute those sentences to
include the possibility of parole. The com-
mittee hopes to present a collection of bills
to the full House later this fall.
An effort to prohibit life-without-parole
sentencing for minors is desperately need-
ed. In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled the
death penalty unconstitutional for minors,
based partially on research by Dr. Dorothy
Otnow Lewis that found a large number of
juvenile offenders on death row in Texas
were products of abuse, suffered mental
illnesses or exhibited signs of brain dys-
function, among other problems. It's unjust
to sentence juveniles as adults when they
don't think, behave or react in the same
way that adults do.
And aside from treating teenagers
unfairly, life without parole is a self-defeat-
ing policy for any corrections system. The
purpose of the corrections system should"
be to rehabilitate offenders, not simply
punish them. But forcing juveniles to
spend the rest of their lives in prison with
no hope of returning to society explicitly
precludes rehabilitation. The state prison
system should work toward reforming
young offenders and giving them a second-

chance to contribute to society as adults
who have learned from their mistakes.
Luckily, ifthebills failtopass, there's still
hope. Two U.S. Supreme Court cases that
will be heard in November could address
the issue of teenagers in prison nationwide.
The first case, Graham v. Florida, involves
a 16-year-old currently serving life with-
out parole for armed home robbery. In the
other case, Sullivan v. Florida, a 13-year-
old boy was convicted for sexual battery.
Both cases argue that life without parole
sentences for juveniles who didn't commit
homicide violates the Eighth Amendment,
which protects citizens against "cruel and
unusual punishment."
The Supreme court should realize, as it
did in 2005, that teenagers can't be held
accountable for their actions to the same
extent adults can. Leaving them to rot
behind bars for the rest of their lives does
not serve the true purpose of the correc-
tions system as a method of rehabilita-
tion. To recognize society's responsibility
to juveniles, life sentences without parole
forjtveniles should be found unconStith-
tional.
If the Supreme Court fails to reject juve-
nile sentences without parole, the Michi-
gan legislature should be ready with its
own legislation to save young people from
a life behind bars without any hope of
redemption.

Military strength makes
liberal li fe possible
TO THE DAILY:
I recently read Anna Sheppard's
response to your articles about the Univer-
sity's "darker history" (Military research is
cutting edge and saves lives, 09/14/2009).
Since weapons researched at universities
have secured my First Amendment rights,
I'll take the time now to exercise them.
I am a veteran of Operation Iraqi Free-
dom, serving at Camp Ramadi from March
to December 2008. I have pretty much
come to terms with the fact that my liberal-
ism and Ann Arbor's really don't match. In
fact, socialism seems to be the order of the
day rather than good old American demo-
cratic-republican liberalism.
Killing people is a very dirty business,
and waris something that should generally
be avoided. However, if you like drinking
alcohol, not having a state-imposed cur-
few on a Friday evening, extra-marital sex
or being a college student at University of
Michigan and having the right to show the
world how ignorant you are with your gen-
uine but misguided attemptsto save lives in
the short run, be thankful for all the weap-
ons and killing that have happened in the
name of securing those rights for you.
I've been to a country where alcohol is

illegal, pornography is illegal and homo-
sexuals get murdered just for being who
they are (yet pederasty is socially accept-
able for some reason). Is this the world you
want to live in? Where gays get stoned just
for their sexual preference?
If your answer is no, and you like the
right to have abortions, be gay or avoid
religious persecution, then be damned
thankful. Thankful for people like the
engineers who design new, effective ways
of killing those who want to deprive you of
your rights and make you conform to their
political beliefs.

UN report is too harsh
toward Israel
TO THE DAILY:
Reading about the United Nations'
recently completed probe into the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, I thought I would
contribute my two cents (UN probe
finds evidence of war crimes in Gaza,
09/16/2009). First, accusations against
Israel need to take into account the fight-
ing conditions. The Palestinian armed
groups don't always wear military uni-,
forms and it's hard to distinguish civil-

ians from armed militants until they fire
at you. The article quoted reports that
the Israeli armed forces failed to "distin-
guish between military targets and the
civilian population." The Palestinians
weren't exactly operating out of declared
military bases - they fight a guerrilla war
with consequences that inevitably include
higher civilian death tolls.
Second, the chief prosecutor is quoted
as saying, "It's very important that justice
should be done." The execution of the war
was justice for Israel. Israelis have dealt
with ongoing rocket attacks fired wildly
into Israeli territory. When the UN does
not completely ignore these attacks, its
committees respond by asking the Pales-
tinians to please stop.
Lastly, instead of waiting for Israel's
patience with Palestinian militant's
attacks to completely expire, the UN
should, perhaps, keep the attacks from
happening in the first place. The UN
force deployed in the region, besides being
grossly under-strengthened, can do noth-
ing to stop the Palestinian attacks unless
the militants decide to invade Israel.
Perhaps the UN will try to deal justice.
If so, I wouldn't be surprised if they found
it difficult to arrest, much less convict, any
Palestinians.

I went to three BAYER
music festivals:
Pitchfork Music Festival in Chi-
cago, Detroit Jazz Festival and the
Detroit Electronic Music Festival.
But for the purpose of this column,
I'll focus on the first two.
The latter can be effectively
summed up by the following three
items: I paid $30 for a green wrist
band, I saw a man who had shaved
a checkerboard pattern into his leg
hair and I saw Flying Lotus. Flying
Lotus was incredible.
At this point in my music-listen-
ing career, I'm turning into a little
bit of an asshole. Of course, I went
though my little-kid-in-a-candy-
store period when I discovered
indie music and realized there's
more to life than "Hot in Herre."
But two things happened this sum-
mer that started making me feel a
little bit jaded: I started listening
to a lot of jazz music and I attended
the Pitchfork Music Festival.
Before I get too many hipster-
propelled tomatoes launched at me,
let me expound: There were a lot of
great acts at Pitchfork. Watching
The Flaming Lips get birthed from
a gigantic vagina on a video screen
was a life-changing experience.
The National put on a much more
intense show than its broodingly
bookish discography would ever
suggest. And Grizzly Bear kicked
ass. Period.
But a festival should be more than
its headliners and, sadly (for me at
least), Pitchfork was not. Save for

cal matters and how to make things
securefur the long-term future.

repetitive work. Just get dawn to it!
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Financial matters are a practical con-
cern today. You're in a penny-pinching
frame of mind. If shopping today, you
will buy only practical things that will
last for a long time.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
You're in sucha serious frame of mind

more experienced than you could be
helpful today. Listen to what others have
to say.

ENERGIZING IDEAS

SA D ALSALAH/Daily
James Rogers, chairman, president and CEO of Duke Energy, speaks at the Carbon
Symposium on Friday. For a full article on the speech, go to michigandaily.com.

with the tour participants," Gra
man wrote in an e-mail. "Studen
and parents now ask more que
tions during the tour and also a
more likely to provide feedback
their guide after the tour."
Kallay said some of the ma
problems with the tours he atten
are thatntheyaretoo long, the wal
ing groups are too big for partic
pants to hear or see the tour guk
and the presentation is monot
nously scripted and impersonal.
As an "evangelist," oKall
preaches the importance of feeli
and ambience in campus visits, c
ing Starbucks and Disney as co
porate examples of how to sell
experience.
"They don't invest in their can
pus experience, though college its
is a huge experience," Kllay said
schools whose campus visit practic
are in need of change. "It's a pla
whereyoueat,whereyousleep,whe
you study and have fun. Prospecti
students want to hear and see th
entire authentic experience."
Feodies Shipp III, assistant dire
tor of undergraduate admissio
at the University of Michigan, sa
that the University has not consu
ed TargetX or similar companie
But, Shipp said, the University do
largely follow the firm's principl
for successful campuovisits.
"On a constant, ongoing basis,

Fairchild recalled one incident
when the cashier at Arby's gave him
a free meal when she discovered
what he was doing.
"I was getting out my wallet
and she was like, 'We don't charge
heroes here,' "he said.
He added, "I'm not a hero, I'm just
doing something anyone could do."
When describing the people he
has met, Fairchild referenced the
1994 film "Forrest Gump," in which
the title character, played by Tom
Hanks, spends years running back
and forth across the country.
"I'm having all of Forrest Gump's
experiences along the way. It's kind
of fun," he said.
Because Fairchild is walking
more than running, he said he has
found this easier than training for
a marathon.
"It's not really that strenuous, and
it's almost like something I think
almost anyone can do because it's
mostly the time, it's mostly being
able tobe alone for-so long," he said.
But Fairchild said the journey
hasn't always been easy - after
_alking 500 miles, he began to
question his trip.
"I was kind of thinking, OK, why
am I really doing this?" he said.
"Yeah, I want to see what's out there
and maybe learn philosophy and go
deep inside myself. But ... I can do
that somewhere else; I don't have to
be doing this."
He said he soon realized he
needed to finish the journey just
to complete it.
"What am Igoing to do anyway?"

our presentation," Shipp said, adding
that evaluations are consistently posi-
tive."Anygooddirectorofadmissions
is constantly asking his or her staff to
u- rigorously evaluate their tactics and
ts make cost-effective changes."
s- Shipp said that while tour guides
re are trained to give specific facts and
to lead the group through the Diagand
in important buildings like Angell
in Hall and the Chemistry Building,
ds manytour choices are up to them.
k- "We don't necessarily prescribe
H- a certain route around campus for
de our tour guides, and we definitely
o- encourage them to make their pre-
sentations personal and share sto-
ay ries," Shipp said. "We are trying to
ng give a sense of the University's scope
it- and size, aswell as its personality."
r- In his experience, Kallay praised
an two TargetX clients, Albion College
and Northern Michigan University,
m- in particular, for their campus pre-
elf sentations.
of "They're two of the most authen-
es tic and rich campus experiences
ce around," he said.
re Kevin Kropf, director of
ve admissions at Albion, was appre-
at ciative of Kallay's critical eye.
"Things that seem matter-of-
c- fact can really have a negative
ns impact on the school's image,"
id Kropf said. "Now we want to
It- treat outsiders like insiders -
s. letting students in on the lingo,
es engaging in the traditions, so
es they kind of feel like they're a
part of the place."
ye Gina Lombardini, assistant
to director of admissions at NMU,
he said. "It's not like I can sit around
my parent's house or ... get an apart-
ment, get a job and start the whole
thing over with no direction."
But fornowhe'stakingitdaybyday.

regardless of whether or not theytcon-
tribute to his cause.
Beyond raising money for MS
research, Fairchild said he doesn't
have any message he wants people
to take away from this. He wants
them to make up their own minds.
"I just kind of put it all out there
into the world and say, wherever
you are, whatever point in your life,
whatever you need, maybe there's
something in there for you," he
said. "I'm just going to put this
energy out there. Take whatever
you need from it."
He added, quoting from "For-
rest Gump": " 'That's all I have to
say about that.'"

agreed, recalling an unpopular
portion of NMU's past campus
tours as an example of miscom-
munication between admissions
directors and tour guides.
"The tours would go past a big
music hall, which was a pretty stan-
dard stop. But hardlyanyone except
music students wanted to see that,"
Lombardini said, adding that tours
no longer include the music hail.
While Kallay reported around 85
percent of his clientele to be smaller
liberal arts schools like Albion, he
said larger public universities like
the University of Michigan always
have room for improvement.
"A lot of larger flagship universi-
ties present their campus experi-
ence really well, which is why so
many applicants choose them in
the end," Kallay said. "But I also
think they should offer a more cus-
tomized experience."
Kallay cited personal elements
like themed tours, which focus

;
,
- ' .

more heavily on particular academ-
ic departments or student organi-
zations, and anecdotes from the
tour guide as improvements many
schools could make.
Regarding the' direction tour
guides face when they walk,'Kallay
was ambivalent.
"It's stressful to watch a person
walk backwards while talking at
you, and it can be distracting, but
our main focus is the feeling the
prospective students and their par-
ents are getting," Kallay said. "You
can walk backwards, forwards,
sideways - it doesn't matter if
you're beingauthentic."
Shipp agreed, saying that Uni-
versity of Michigan tour guides are
not instructed to face a particular
direction, only to engage all mem-
bers of the tour.
"College is fun, and somehow
we've made it seem like a challeng-
ing and daunting thing," Kallay
said. "Tours should dispel that."

FAIRCHILD
From Page 1A
about the idea, he said, the more it
made sense and the more possible
it seemed.
Rather than renewing the lease
on his Chicago apartment or active-
ly hunting for a new job, Fairchild
decided to start planning his run
across the country.
"Everything just kind of lined
up,"he said.
Fairchild also said he saw this
as an opportunity to raise money
for MS, drawing inspiration from
a friend who has suffered from the
disease for years.
Withthegoalofraising$25,O0 for
MS research, Fairchild soon started
making plans for the 3,400-mile trip.
Figuring that he could travel about
30-35 miles per day, he estimated the
tripwouldttakehim aboutfourtofive
months, starting in August and end-
ing in mid-December.
"I really didn't do any training for
it, or anything like that," he said. "I
can run if I want or walk if I want,
I'm not really bound by a lot."
Fairchild mapped out a route
from Boston to Ann Arbor, and then
to Chicago where he would take
Route 66 to Los Angeles.
When he first started his journey,
Fairchild just used a compass point-
ing west, but now he uses Google
Maps to plan his route.
"Most of the planning I do now on
a day-to-day basis" he said. "I know
where 'm stopping almost every day,

but there's still the adventure of'who
knowswhat's going to happen?"
Fairchild walks along the side of
the highway, pushingthe modified
stroller with just the essentials -
water bottles, energy bars, a tent
and sleeping bag, a camera, a cou-
ple of books and a laptop to blog his
progress.
"That was one of the things Istart-
ed thinking about ... What if I had
nothing?" he said. "What if I really
gave itup and all I had was the stuffI
carried with meon the road? I'd still
have pretty much everything."
Fairchild considers his current
address as wherever he's sleeping
on a given night, and his home as
the road. When asked by a passing
driver if he needed a ride home, he
said he wasn't sure how to answer
the question.
"I kind of realized, well, right
here, I am home," he said. "Every
other step I take, that's now my
new home."
A typical diiy on the roadhbegins at
7 a.m., and Fairchild says it's "pretty
boring." His diet primarily consists
ofroadside Â£ t o,%andhe's learned
to predict his dining options from the
litter bythe side of the road.
Fairchild said he has used this
trip as an opportunity to meet inter-
esting people along the way.
"The first couple questions are
always almost the same and you're
wondering, 'Oh, is this going to be
the same kind of conversation,' "
he said, "And, you know, you never
know ... People can surprise you
sometimes."

From Page 1A
record of corruption and failure to
control Taliban violence makes his
projected win an unfavorable out-
come for the United States.
"Initially the Obama adminis-
tration was hoping the incumbent
Karzai would lose," he said.
International criticism over
the legitimacy of the results has
focused specifically on one-third
of the votes that went to Karzai.
Those ballots are now under
review, after the Electoral Com-
plaints Commission called for
recounts and forensic examina-
tions of ballot boxes in 10 per-
cent of polling places.
Suny argues that the failure
of the election extends beyond
its association with fraud and
low voter turnout prompted by
Taliban violence, and deeper
into more fundamental issues
that face a democratic election
held in a tribal nation.
"These kinds of elections are a
Western innovation," he said. "In
tribal societies these elections
don't quite operate the same way
(they do in the United States)."
Near Eastern Studies Prof.
KevorkBardakjiansaidthefailure
of the election is another sign that
the U.S:s concept of democracy
may not work in countries with
different foundational structures.
"Weshould letthemdetermine
their government and electoral
process the way they see fit with
the various religious tenants,
tribal system, etc.," Bardakjian
said. "It is not for us to decide.
Afghanistan is not a democratic
country, and I don't think it will
be in the foreseeable future."
Bardkajian said that the Unit-
ed States had "no business"being
in Afghanistan in the first place
and that the country "should
leave as soon as possible."
"(The election) is the strategy
to pull out," he said. "The only

way is to leave the country to a
legitimate government. This had
to happen sooner or later."
He added: "I hope we can with-
draw in an orderly fashion and let
them take matters through their
own hands."
Cole said that the common argu-
ment to continue U.S. involvement
in the conflict is falling more and
more short by the day.
"The standard line in the United
States is that we are fighting this

so al-Qaida can't hit us," he said.
"There isn't actually any al-Qaida
in Afghanistan. So this is not a
very compelling argument."
Marwil said the recent call for
more U.S. troops to join the fight
by Adm. Mike Mullen, one of Pres-
ident Obama's top advisors in the
region, only complicates the issue.
"Support for Afghanistan in
America is draining like water out
of the bathtub," he said. "And if more
Americans are killed, then forget it."

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com
New rules change how
banks market on campus

From Page 1A
73,000 alumni accounts open
and 1,500 student accounts open,
according to Sigler. So long as the
10-year contract remains in place,
the revenue from these accounts
will remain constant. The legisla-
tion could affect the terms of a pos-
sible future contract, though.
Christine Lindstrom, director
of the Higher Education Project
on debt conducted by the United
States Public Interest Research
Groups, said there are two key pro-
visions within the CARD Act that
will protect students as consum-
ers.
The first condition Lindstrom
highlighted is the issue of tabling
and handing out giveaways in
exchange for opening a credit
account, which will no longer be
permitted on campuses after this
legislation comes into affect. Lind-
strom said that without giveaways,
students will be more focused on
the terms and conditions of the
credit agreements they're signing.
The secoid condition is that
students under the age of 21 must
have a cosigner or be approved via
a financial background check prior
to being approved for a credit card.
Lindstrom said the need for
students to show income or assets
before being able to obtain a credit
card without a cosigner is also a
major component to the new legis-
lation that will enable students to
be educated consumers.
"Previous to this point, students
in college were the only consumers
who weren't held to a standard of
what your income and your assets
are," Lindstrom said. "And based
on your income and your assets, we
will then give you an interest rate
and a credit line, and that basically
is the way it works for every adult
in society except for students."
Another important component
of the legislation that will help
lower student credit card debt is
the opportunity to lower penalty
interest rates over time, Lind-
strom said.

"That's huge andverysignificant
in terms of decreasing debt because
that's not the case now," Lindstrom
said. "By giving the cardholder
some ability to proactively fix the
problems that they had, to get out
from underneath the penalty inter-
est rate, you can lower the debtthat
that person would otherwise face."
Lindstrom said she sees the
necessity of a cosigner as essential
in protecting students from debt
they would otherwise be suscep-
tible to acquiring if there were no
background checks on assets.
"If you're qualifying for credit
that you can't afford, of course
you're plunging yourself into deep-
er debt than you otherwise should
be in," Lindstrom said.
In U.S. PIRG's Campus Credit
Card Trap Study, conducted from
October 2007 to February 2008, 66
percent of students had at least one
credit card. Out of that number, 30
percenthad a cosigner or their par-
ents paid their credit card bill. For
those students who paid their own
credit card bills, 36 percent paid
their bills in full each month, while
34 percent carried a balance.
Peter Garuccio, senior director
of public relations for the American
Bankers Association, said the pro-
visions of the CARD Act are going
to drastically change the nature of
the credit card industry.
"Really when you look at all of
the provisions en masse, in all,
it really requires a new business
model," Garuccio said. "They've
got to change their operations,
they've got to change their market-
ing, they've got to change their risk
assessment, they've got to change
their pricing. They have to change
everything really."
But he added that the effect
the legislation will have on stu-
dents opening credit accounts
remains unclear because the Fed-
eral Reserve hasn't yet established
well-defined guidelines of how
to determine if a student has suf-
ficient income or assets to qualify
for a credit card.
Garuccio said the association

is awaiting a preliminary rule on
those guidelines by the end of the
month and a final rule that will be
adopted by the end of the year.
"Until we know what that looks
like, we don't know what the full
effect is going to be," he said. "But
again, suffice to say it's going to be
tougher for people in this age group
to geta card."
Garuccio said he thinks banks
and universities will still partner
up through affinity agreements
- like the one between the Uni-
versity's Alumni Association and
Bank of America - in the future to
create programs that are mutually
beneficial to each party.
But he said not many students
actually open credit accounts
through campus displays because
programs are geared toward alum-
ni - as is the case with the one at
the University.
Some students said they think
the new legislation requiring
those under 21 years old to have a
cosigner to open a credit account
will protect students from piling
up debt and from overcharging on
items they can't afford.
LSA sophomore Paige Tibbits
said she is waiting to get a credit
card until she is older because she
doesn't want to rely on it to make
payments.
"I kind of agree with that
because if you don't have any
source of income or any way to
pay offa credit card, you could put
yourselfinaserious financial situa-
tion that could potentially damage
your future," she said. "It makes
sense that if you don't have a reli-
able source of income, why should
you have a credit card?"
But some students, like LSA
junior Rachel Rickard,think people
under 21 years old should be able
to open their own credit accounts
without a cosigner.
"To me that seems kind of ridic-
ulous because I don't have a job
during the school year; I only have
a job during the summer," Rickard
said. "And I have a credit card and
I can pay it off."
Rickard said she uses her cred-
it card for certain educational
expenses, like textbooks, in order
to build up her credit history.
"BasicallyIuseitsoIhave estab-
lished credit now, and I never pay
for anything with it that I know
that I don't have the funds to pay
back," she said.

Putting it plainly, this is by no
means an "easy" record. The lay-

an adventure in itself. Polvo has
always been able to find a tasteful
mix of ambient experimental rock
and SST-inspired noise, lurking
somewhere in a mid-'80s alterna-

that again here.
And while it may be pretty easy
to count the band's influences on
one hand, Polvo blends them well
enough to give its artistic state-
ments considerable merit. Plus it
does, like, way better than most
bands. Derivatives aside, In Prism
marks a welcomed return to the
sounds that dominated the '80s
underground, with some '90s
experimentalism and '00s fidelity
added to the mix to make it work
in the present.

Zero good reasons to see 9

By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
In "9," the fate of the world rests in the hands of nine
creatures made from burlap sacks.
However alarmingthis prospectmay
seem, the whimsical world of direc-
tor Shane Acker ("The Astounding 9
Talents of Mr. Grenade") should
whisk viewers away from their fears At Quality16
of impendingglobal destruction. and Showcase
The character 9 (voiced by Eli- Focus Features
jah Wood, "The Lord of the Rings")
first opens his eyes to see a world
destroyed. The only other sentient beings he encoun-
ters are eight similarly small burlap robots and a terri-
fying host of angry machines. The nine robots must do
battle againstthemachines to ensure the preservation
of some semblance of humanity.
"9" was originally a short film with much the same
storyline. The short was so successful that it was
adapted into this full-length feature. The short film,
in fact, was nominated for an Oscar back in 2005. But
while the new version is only 79 minutes long - mak-
ing it much shorter than most modern features - it is
an unnecessarily long extension of the original.
The power of the original film gets diluted when
stretched to take up the 79-minute span. There are too
many chase scenes and far too much plot repetition.
One member of the nine is captured and the rest have
to go rescue him. Then another is captured on that
rescue mission and he needs rescuing - after a while,
it gets tedious.
Despite the hiccups in the story, the animation is
still enamoring. There are some truly beautiful over-
laps between the world built by the humans and the
world of the machines. The nine robots find sanctu-
ary in an old sculpture garden, setting a scene that
is both sad and truly haunting. In another moment,
amidst the destruction, they find an old phonograph

record and "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" plays
while the bots rummage through remnants of the
past.
Despite being an animated film, "9" carries a PG-13
rating, accurately indicating that the movie is not for
small children. It's a film ripe with graphic and dis-
turbing images and characters; one of the machine
monsters is a snake-like creature with the head of a
possessed baby doll.
At the same time, the plot and the message remain
fairlysimple.Butit'ssimpleinanegativesense-utter-
ly basic and obvious. Though "9" aims to captivate
an older audience, it cannot get past unsophisticated
imagery - a burning church, a contrast between light
and dark and ruinedbooks.
Further, the characters are all helplessly one-
dimensional. Each of the nine robots has essentially
one personal quality. Number 7 (Jennifer Connelly,
"He's Just Not ThatInto You") is the ferocious female,
Number 1 (Christopher Plummer, "Up") is bossy and
Number 5 (John C. Reilly, "Step Brothers") is always
scared. Talented actors voice each of the nine robots,
so it's unfortunate that the script turns them into a
About as entertaining
as a burlap sack.
more boring version of the seven dwarfs.
Beyond the identity crisis resulting from the scary
animation and the simplistic script, the film suffers
from the fact that several aspects of the plot, particu-
larly the conclusion, will never make sense to anyone,
no matter what age theyare.
The film is an admirable attempt at turning a short
film into a full-length movie, and it manages to keep
some of its integrity, but in the end it's a failure.

occasional hiccups, the general
interplay remains crudely funny.
The true beauty of the movie
is derived from its simplicity. It
doesn't harbor deep thematic
undertones, but it isn't superficial
either. "Humpday" stays true to
its premise of two men dancing
around each other's egotism. As
a result, the film is great for both
male and female audiences. Guys
can relate to how stupid (and yet
so important) their egos can be,
and how far it can take them,
while girls can at least attempt to
understand what goes. on inside
the male mind.
The unique "bonding" shared
by Ben and Andrew goes beyond a
mere dare. "Humpday" is a testa-
ment to the power of friendship.
Lifelong friends will remain that
way, even with all the humps in
between.

Senior Carlos Brown tallied 187 rushing yards on 13 carries. He also had two touchdowns, including a 90-yarder, the third-longest rushing touchdown in the history of Michigan football.

of Michigan's
45-17 win over Eastern

yards, including a 90- LINCOLN_

that was the third lon-

gest in Michigan history, made him the
hero of a Michigan offense that rushed for
380 yards, the most since 2003.
His teammates definitely knew it. But
Brown didn't seem to.
"Our sideline was nuts," sophomore wide
receiver Darryl Stonum said of Brown's 90-
yard score. "I was actually trying to get to
him to celebrate in the end zone and he took
off on me, so I was like, 'All right, forget it.
I'll jog. I'll catch you on the sideline: "
He may have shunned the celebration,
but it's on the sidelines where Brown has
spent most of his career. Whether it was
because of any number of nagging injuries
or former Michigan running back Mike

seen flashes of the real Brown.

Ground attack dooms EMU

By ANDY REID
Daily Sports Editor
Just a week after Tate Forcier cemented
his status as the Michigan football team's
poster boy in a comeback win over Notre
Dame, T-shirts boasting,"May The Forcier
Be With You" began to show up in the Big
House.
In the student section, an enormous sign
stating "We Love Tate!" appeared Saturday
against Eastern Michigan, announcing the
fans' unbridled adoration for the young-

ster.
And with highlights galore on ESPN and
a Sports Illustrated cover story, it was gen-
erally assumed that the Wolverines' future
rested squarely on his shoulders.
Hold on.
Just as Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
repeatedly reminds himself that Forcier
is still a freshman, everyone in Michigan
Stadium needs to be reminded that Rodri-
guez's offense is based around a bruising
ground game.
That was more apparent than ever on

Saturday, with the sluggish defense giving
up 128 rushing yards and Forcier's less-
than-stellar 7-of-13, 68-yard performance.
Forcier, who until Saturday had looked
nearly unstoppable, had a few freshman
miscues but was bailed out by the relent-
less run support, which was too much for
the Eagles in Michigan's 45-17 romp.
With the win, Michigan (3-0) matched
its win total from last year's disastrous 3-9
campaign.

Junior Jackie Carron lofted a picturesque

straight into the crossbar but launched the
rebound into the net, scoring her team-high
third goal of the season.
"Holly's a gamer," Ryan said. "She gets a

It was the only score of the day, enough
for the Wolverines to beat the Hurricanes 1-0

With the win, the Wolverines (5-5) sur-
passed last season's win total. And after the

Before the lone goal, the match had been
somewhat even. Michigan had its chances
but Miami's attack seemed relentless, with
10 shots and three corner kicks in the first
half alone.
But when the ball got deep in their half of
the field, the Wolverine defense held its own
and forced the Hurricanes to take most of
their shots from outside the box.
Miami threatened even more in the sec-
ond half.
With just over 18 minutes left to play,
goalie Haley Kopmeyer tried to cradle the
ball, but it took a funny bounce and got away.
A Miami player took the ball, but sophomore
Kim Siebert was in position to get her foot
in, to give time for Kopmeyer to recover and
make the save.
Ryan said it was the only mistake that
Kopmeyer made on the day, and Carron de-
scribed Kopmeyer's play as "phenomenal."

one of the best
Michigan football wins in the last

Lloyd Carr retired a winner.
After struggling with spread-of-

was a bowl game, which, as Michi-

can never take for granted.
So, I walked out of the stadium

Michigan fans in the student section chanted "It's Great To Be A Michigan Wolverine" after the game Saturday. Really? C'monguys.

Wolverines head over to the stu-
dent section after each win. But the
crowd should sing the fight song,
chant "Let's Go Blue" or something
- instead of busting out the big
guns for nothing.
That's like buying your friend a
sheet cake on his half-birthday. I
guess it kind of makes a little sense,
but seriously? C'mon.
After a so-so win over East-
ern Michigan is not the time to
be chanting "It's Great, To Be, A
Michigan Wolverine." Save that for

Penn State or Ohio State, who are
both comingto the Big House this
season.
A lot of people might say that
I'm makinga bigstink out of noth-
ing, that it's just a chant and the
students who hollered it after the
Wolverines beat the Eagles were
just trying to have fun.,
But you're diluting the greatness
of the simple chant.
In 2007, I took a road trip to Illi-
nois to watch Michigan play. After
both Mike Hart and Chad Henne

battled severe injuries and Adrian
Arrington threw a pass to fellow-
wideout Mario Manningham, the
Wolverines toppled the eventual-
Rose Bowl-bound Fighting Illini,
27-17.
In the bowels of the stadium
after the game, Michigan fans took
over, cheering "It's Great. To Be. A
Michigan Wol-ver-ine" louder and

'M' places three in
top 10 at invitational

Tauro leads
Wolverines at
non-scoring event
By MARTY LAROUERE
Daily Sports Writer
Injuries and inexperience
couldn't stop the Michigan wom-
en's cross country team from plac-
ing three runners in the top 10 in
the non-scoring Spartan Invita-
tional on Friday.
Junior Danielle Tauro was the
team's top finisher at Forest Akers
East Golf Course, placing second
overall with a time of 21:19.
"I felt really good at 3K," Tauro
said. "At 4K, Michigan State start-
ed to pick up the pace. I just tried
to keep the gap within reasonable
distance."
While the veteran Tauro led
the Wolverines, true freshmen
Kaitlyn Patterson and Rebecca
Addison started their careers off
strong in their first-ever six-kilo-
meter race.
Patterson finished ninth at
21:56 and Addison came in 12th
at 22:07.
"Kaitlyn is improving leaps and
bounds since high school," Tauro
said. "She's surprising us with
how fast she's running, oniy being
with the team for a few months."
Michigan head coach Mike
McGuire was pleased with the
results from the Spartan Invita-
tional.
"Our first three ran a step
up from the Michigan Open,"
McGuire said of the Sept. 4 meet.
"Today was like my stocks- a few
up, a few down. We are moving
forward and progressing with
several of them."

in the right place to coddle it away
from the net.
The game was also dictated by
very physical play. Michigan and
Miami combined for 25 fouls. Hein
said that physical games earlier in
the season allowed the Wolverines
to adapt and be prepared for games
like yesterday's.
The Hurricanes even had to play
a man down for the last 12 minutes
of the game when junior Miami
defender Brittney Macdonald was
given her second yellow card of the
game.
But Ryan knows Michigan beat a

very good Miami team.
"This is a teamthat (Miami coach
Tricia Taliaferro) has been recruit-
ing for years and years," Ryan said.
"It's a very talented team. They're
very tall. They're very athletic and
fast and skillftl. They're smart. And
I've got a team that's being rebuilt."
Even though the Hurricanes
were talented, Michigan beat them
with help from each other.
"That was the difference all day,"
Ryan said. "If somebody was mak-
ing mistakes somebody was cover-
ing up for it. And that allowed us to
have the shutout."

Shooting practice on
Friday pays off
during victory over
winless WMU
By JAKE FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan's defense has been
stingy, its offense explosive, and
its goalkeeping impeccable.
But the team's glaring weakness
has been finishing, so in practice
on Friday, the Wolverines focused
extensively on shooting. On Sat-
urday, they reaped the benefits in
Kalamazoo.
Five Wolverines scored in
Michigan's 5-1 thrashing of West-
ern Michigan at the WMU Soc-
cer Complex. Junior defender
Adam Keller opened the scoring
extravaganza in the 33rd minute,
netting Michigan's first opening-

goals ii
half goal of the season. Michigan
coach Steve Burns called the play a
nominee for the top-10 goals of the
year, as Keller blasted a one-timer
into the bottom left corner.
"Keller gotthe first goal and that
kind of set the tone for the rest of
the game," senior captain Julian
Robles said. "Once you get that
first one against certain teams, it
builds our confidence up. We were
just continuing to create chances."
Star forward Mauro Fuzetti
was sidelined with a hyperextend-
ed knee, but Michigan's offense
appeared unfazed. The Wolver-
ines (6-1) sent long balls down
the flanks, watched their speedy
forwards blaze by defenders, and
ended the half with a 2-0 lead.
Michigan's backline dictated
the game's tempo as the Wol-
verines found themselves with
enough time to reverse the point of
attack and catch the Broncos (0-6)
out of position. The Wolverines
outshot Western Michigan 10-1 in

the period.
With a sizeable lead in the sec-
ond half, Burns rested his starters
and watched his reserves ice the
game assertively. Redshirt fresh-
man midfielder Alex Klein and
junior midfielder Alex Wood con-
tinued the rout, with each tallying
their first career goals.
"We brought in a couple guys
off the bench to hopefully main-
tain the level of play and they did
a great job of not having a drop off
of levels," Robles said. "We kept on
attacking, we kept creating chanc-
es and we probably could have had
a couple more."
The Wolverines controlled play
from start to finish for the first
time all season, raiding the attack-
ing box for much of the game.
But most importantly, they fin-
ished.
"This was the first game where ,
we came out and there was never a
question who would win the game,"
Keller said. "We dominated."

Daily Sports Editor
Quarterback Denard Robinson's
blazing speed has already beer
well-documented and highly publi-
cized. But after having almost foul
fewer months than fellow fresh-
man quarterback Tate Forcier tt
learn the offensive playbook, Rob-
inson's passing game hasn'tobeen ir
the spotlight.
"Denard always wants to prove
he can throw the ball," Michigar
coach Rich Rodriguez said afte
Saturday's 45-17 win over Easterr
Michigan. "He
made a couple NOTEBOO}
decisions today
that maybe
weren't the best, but he can make
all the throws. As coaches, we have
to remember he's only three games
into his career."
Robinson disagreed with Rodri-
guez's assessment.
"I'm not trying to prove noth-
ing," Robinson said. "I'mnot trying
to prove to nobody, just myself"
When Robinson tried to thros
in this week's game, the results
weren't pretty. He finished 0-for-4
with two interceptions Saturday
though his best pass was one tha
was negated. He currently has a
-6.10 passer rating through three
games.
The freshman came in at quar-
terback with Michigan up 24-10
late in the first half and lofted a
beautiful 24-yard pass to wide
receiver Martavious Odoms, who
caught the ball before running ou
of bounds. But when the play was
reviewed, Odoms was found to nol
have full possession of the ball and
the catch was overturned.
Robinson tried again, this time
throwing a pass about 35 yards
down the field for Odoms. But East-
ern Michigan defensive back Chris
May leaped in front of Odoms fo
the interception, and the Eagles
scoredontheensuingdrivetobring
the game within seven by halftime
His other interception came again
at the hands of May with about fou
minutes left in the game.
"One of them was a misread, and
one of them wasn't," quarterbacks
coach Rod Smith said of the inter-
ceptions. "But like Isaid,that's how

'D' looks

Daily Sports Editor
Judging by the scoreboard at
halftime Saturday, it seemed like
Michigan still hadn'tgotten over
its Notre Dame hangover.
By the end of Saturday's first
half, the Wolverines led Eastern
Michigan by just seven points.
The Eagles had 11 first downs to
Michigan's nine. After averag-
ing 106 rushing yards through
their first two games, Eastern
Michigan had already racked
up 128 rushing yards in the first
half alone.
It seemed like the Wolverines
were primed for a letdown after
all of last week's hype following
Michigan's 38-34 comeback win
against the Fighting Irish.
But listening to redshirt
junior linebacker Obi Ezeh, it
sounds like the slow start simply
might be because the Wolver-
ines aren't morning people.
"You try to avoid it, but it
was an early game," Ezeh said.
"We've been used to these 3 p.m.
games. I don't want to use that
as an excuse, but guys get used
to things, and you change it up

and you have to give them time
to grow accustomed to it. I'm
glad we survived this one, but
we have to be ready in the first
quarter next time."
Regardless of the underlying
mental reasons, the Wolverine
defense was missing reads, hav-
ing difficulty anticipating plays
and not controlling gaps in the
first half. The Eagle offense ran
plays the Wolverines hadn't seen
on tape, and the defense was ini-
tially slow to adjust.
One of those missed reads led
to Eastern's first touchdown,
on a play-action fake from the
Michigan 11-yard line. Eagles
quarterback Andy Schmitt faked
a handoff to Eastern Michigan
running back Terrence Blevins,
and as senior defensive end
Brandon Graham fell for the
play, Schmitt rolled to the right
and easily ran into the corner of
the end zone. The touchdown
tied the score at 10 with 11 min-
utes left in the first half.
"We was killing ourselves,
we was missing assignments
early in the game," Graham said.
"We was thinking too much out
there. We went out there, we
weren't calm."
After the defense's uninspired
first half, it came out in the third
quarter ready to play. The Wol-
verines held the Eagles scoreless
with just 51 rushing yards and
six first downs in the whole sec-
ond half
Late in the third quarter,
Schmitt, under pressure, threw
the ball as Obi Ezeh flew toward
him. Ezeh's hit knocked the ball

i fine, and we'll keep working him
and getting him ready."
Robinson came to Michigan
partially because it was one of the
- only schools that recruited him as a
quarterbackandplannedtousehim
a for more than just his speed. Fol-
lowing Forcier's big game against
Notre Dame last week, Rodriguez
t insisted that Robinson would con-
s tinue to take snaps at quarterback
t and that the team has no plans to
I make him a slot receiver.
"Oh, yeah, yes. I'm a quarter-
back, I'm not just a running back,"
A said Robinson after Saturday's
- game, when asked if he was pre-
s pared to throw 15 to 20 passes in a
r future game. "That's the only posi-
s tion I play."
But Robinson looked like he
. could easily play the part of a star
a running back Saturday, with 60
r yards and two touchdowns on just
three carries. The scores came
I when the game was already out of
s reach, but Robinson ran the ball in
- the end zone both times in impres-
sive fashion.
On a third-and-two on the East-
weak
h start
off course and freshman Craig
Roh fell on the ball for the inter-
ception, which gave the Wolver-
ines possession at the Eastern
Michigan 21-yard line. The Wol-
verines scored a few plays later to
make the score 38-17 and put the
game effectively out of reach.
As the Wolverine defense
made adjustments and the explo-
sive Michigan offense scored 21
unanswered points, the Eagles
felt forced to rely more on their
passinggame.
"It took us out of our running
game," Eastern Michigan coach
Ron English said. "We just felt
that we needed to catch up, so
we had to throw the ball a little
bit more than we wanted to."
But the Eagles could only
muster 62 yards in the air during
the third and fourth quarters.
And on what ended up being its
last legitimate scoring chance of
the game, with about 11 minutes
left in the fourth quarter, the
Michigan defense overpowered
Eastern Michigan's running
game, too. The Eagles couldn't
score after reaching the Michi-
gan 9-yard line on a first-and-
goal. With third down and two
yards to go for a touchdown,
Eagles running back Dwayne
Priest was stuffed behind the
line of scrimmage by four Mich-
igan defenders. Eastern Michi-
gan ended up turning the ball
over on downs.
Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez said after the game he
wasn't particularly concerned
about the defense's play, since
the team needs to improve on
all three phases. Still, after a
sluggish second quarter by the
Wolverine defense and an over-
matched secondary against
Notre Dame last week, this
week marks the second in a row
that the Michigan defense hasn't
dominated for all 60 minutes.
Before Saturday's game, the
Wolverine defense was second-
to-last in the Big Ten in total
defense, allowing 301total yards
to Western Michigan and 490 to
Notre Dame. Though Saturday's
game could overall be consid-
ered an improvement on paper -
Eastern Michigan racked up 285
yards - the defense's tendencies
to miss reads and not fill in the
gaps could still be a major con-

cern come Big Ten season.
"They were doing some things
to us that we hadn't repped, and
that we hadn't seen all week,"
Ezeh said. "So we just had to
make some minor adjustments,
you know, and eliminate a lot of
the big plays that you saw in the .
first half.
"We came out in the second
half with a kind of renewed
energy and just really resolved
on stopping Eastern Michigan."

ern Michigan 13-yard line, Robin-
son came into the game, kept the
ball off the snap and shook off four
separate Eastern Michigan tackle
attempts en route to the goal line.
His second touchdown was a dis-
play of pure speed as he zig-zagged
through the Eagles defense for a
36-yard score.
Through three games, Robin-
son is the team leader in rushing
touchdowns and second in rushing
yards.
LEACH SURPRISES: Another
week, another walk-on standout.
Last week, it was open tryouts
walk-on Jordan Kovacs, who came
in during the second half of the
tight game against Notre Dame
after safety Mike Williams was
injured. This Saturday, walk-on
linebacker Kevin Leach started,
for the Wolverines after linebacker
Jonas Mouton was suspended for
one game.
Mouton appeared to punch
Notre Dame center Eric Olsen in
the face during last Saturday's
game. The act was a point of con-
tention all week, with Rodriguez

his tackle total from last year in
just one game Saturday, leading the
team in tackles with 10 (three solo
and seven assisted).
One of his notable tackles came
on a third-down Eastern Michigan
stop and another helped preserve
the Michigan defense's second-half
shutout after Eastern Michigan had
a first-and-goal in the fourth quar-
ter with the Wolverines up 38-17.
Leach and freshman Craig Roh
stopped quarterback Andy Schmitt
at the six-yard line, and the Eagles
eventually turned the ball over on
downs at the Michigan five-yard
line.
INJURY REPORT: With right
guard David Moosman already
out against Eastern Michigan, the
offensive line couldn't afford to lose
another starter.
That's why Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez sounded so concerned
during the post-game press con-
ference when he said center David
Molk may have suffered a serious
foot injury.
Molk told coaches his foot was
bothering him in the first half of
Saturday's game and left the game
inthe second half.IfMolk can't play
next week against Indiana,redshirt
freshman Rocko Khoury or Moos-
man may take his place.
At running back, Carlos Brown
got the start over senior Brandon
Minor on Saturday. Minor had just
three carries for21yards, all on the
Wolverines' first touchdown drive
of the game. Minor has had a frus-
trating senior season so far - a nag-
ging ankle injury also kept him out
of the Western Michigan game.
"He tried to go a little bit, but
after a few series he said, 'Coach,
it's really sore.'So we said we'd hold
him out of there," Rodriguez said.
As he has all season, though,
Minor discounted the idea of any
possible injuries.
"Oh, yeah," he said, when asked
after the game if he is in good
health.
Safety Mike Williams also left
the game with an injury, and fresh-
man quarterback Tate Forcier was
momentarily stunned on the field
after a play in the third quarter but
played the next offensive series.
Rodriguez said after the game that
Forcier was bruised and had the
wind knocked out of him.

denying he had seen any wrong-
doing during Wednesday's press,
conference. Michigan lineback-
ers coach Jay Hopson said during
Thursday night's radio show that
the referee was right in front of
the play and would have called it
if there was an issue, but Big Ten
officials announced Friday that the
league was punishing Mouton for
one game.
Leach said the Michigan coach-
ing staff told him Thursday after-
noon that he would get the start.
"I call him the second Kovacs
because he came in and he didn't
lose a step just like (Kovacs) last
week," junior strong safety Troy
Woolfolk said. "Actually, Kovacs
came in again and did his thing. So
we have two good second-string
people who can play just like the
first string."
Though Leach played in six
games last year, two of those at
linebacker, this Saturday's game
was the first he played from start
to finish.
Last season,he finished with just
two assisted tackles. He quintupled

From page 1B
it's a big momentum-booster,"
sophomore running back Mike
Shaw said. "And it's also letting the
Big Ten know, 'Hey, don't just worry
about the freshman quarterback.
We got a running game that can put
up 350 yards'"
Senior Brandon Minor, who is still
nursing an ankle injury, took limited
carries against Eastern Michigan.
But the Wolverines pounded the
ball with Carlos Brown. Then Mi-
nor. Then Mike Shaw, Denard Rob-
inson, Vincent Smith and Michael
Cox. Even wide receiver Martavi-
ous Odoms got into the fun, taking
an end-around reverse in for a 13-
yard touchdown.
It didn't matter who carried the
ball - the Eagles couldn't slow any
of them down.
"We wanted to try to get as
many guys in as we could," Michi-
gan quarterbacks coach Rod Smith
said. "You know, get their feet wet,

and get them some playing time.
That's important. We think we
have a great stable of tailbacks, and
we're deep."
All told, Michigan posted 380
yards on the ground - the most in
the Rich Rodriguez era - and eight
players registered at least one dou-
ble-digit gainer. The Wolverines av-
eraged an outstanding 9.7 yards per
rush which was boosted by Carlos
Brown's 90-yard scamper, the third-
longest rushing play in Michigan
football history.
And that's exactly how the Wol-
verines planned it.
"We wanted to come in and es-
tablish the run from the beginning,"
sophomore wideout Darryl Stonum
said. "We studied a lot of film and
we saw that they left the middle of
the field wide open, so that's where
all our big runs came from. We just
wanted to~gash the middle of the
field, and that's what we did today."
The Eagles (0-3) have been weak
against the run all season, giving up
300 yards on the ground to triple-
option heavy Army in an opening-

week loss.
The offensive line took advan-
tage, opening large gaps all game for
the running backs to get to the sec-

Eagles had no answer.
"Some of our fast guys did a great
job of hitting it north and south,
pulled away from defenders and
showed some speed, which was
nice to see"Rodriguez said. "Butwe
weren't particularly sharp throwing
the ball, so it was a good thing we
could run.'
Through three games, the Wol-
verines arethe No.1rushing offense

270 yards a game. That will give op-
ponents nightmares as conference
play begins next week.
"We love it," said Shaw who
posted 57 yards and a touchdown.
"When (Brown) is in there, we're
cheering him on, and then he comes
to the sideline and tells us what the
defense is doing. Then when it's our
time to go, we do what we can do.
And we just keep rotating and keep
each other fresh.

From page 1B
Brown exploded in the Wolverines'
eighthloss ofthe season for115 yards.
But as the cold mix of rain and snow
fell over Michigan Stadium with a
bowl game already out of reach, his
breakout game went relatively un-
noticed.
What made his performance Sat-
urday so special was the way it hap-
pened. With a rushing outburst that
earned him Big Ten Offensive Player
of the week honors, Brown was fi-
nally in the center of it all.
Whether he embraced it or not,
Saturday was Carlos Brown's day.
And for his sake, you have to feel
good for him.
Although he started because of
an ailing Minor, Minor's physicality
was not missed Saturday. Instead, it
was Brown's characteristic elusive
speed and breakout power that drew

cheers.
Rather than running straight to
the locker room following the game,
it was Brown who was swarmed by
reporters. And he answered every
question with the same consider-
ation and compassion that's kepthim
around Ann Arbor for four years.
Following his freshman year,
Brown considered transferring. As a
high school quarterback turned run-
ning back, Brown wasn't sure how
he fit in with former Michigan coach
Lloyd Carr's offense.
"I knew my heart was here and
Coach (Carr) always told me pa-
tience was a virtue," Brown recalled.
"And that iflI waited one day, I would
get a shot to play here."
Brown's playing opportunities
have been few and far between. But
he's used his time in the shadows to
be a player Michigan fans could be
proud of.
Before a 2008 Capital One Bowl
team event, Brown befriended a
five-year old boy named Lonnie and

laughed and played with him for the
better part of two hours. Lonnie was
blind, and that had a special meaning
for Brown.
"We had a little special connec-
tion, because when I was younger,
my little brother (Angelo) lost sight
in one of his eyes," Brown told The
Ann Arbor News in December 2007.
"My little brother was younger than
that when it happened..It was an
accident. He was like 3 years old....
He's got one eye, but now I think he
sees better than I can."
Brown may have been destined
for the spotlight when he came to
Ann Arbor. He was supposed to be
the one to make 110,000 fans in the
Big House feel good. But in passing,
he's always been a Michigan Man on
the sidelines.
It's time for us to feel good for
Brown. He's certainly done enough
to deserve it.

lighthearted and drew laughs when he addressed the

key Michigan injuries, he shed the smile pretty quickly.

After watching Darryl Stonum race his way to a
touchdown off a kickoff return last week, we were
expecting more from the special teams. Sure,
they didn't screw up at all during the game -but
they didn't do anything spectacular, either.

HYPE-0-METER
1/4 "Yawn." That seemed to be the general sentiment in
Michigan Stadium when the game started. And it never
got much louder than that. Yeah, we know the Wolver-
Big Houses
Ines were playing Eastern Michigan. But you have to get
excited about every win, especially after last season.
