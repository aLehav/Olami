More than 100 people showed 

up Wednesday afternoon at 
South Hall for a panel with 
three former general counsels 
for the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, hosted by 
the University of Michigan Law 
School’s Environmental Law 
and Policy Program.

The panel, comprising the 

EPA’s top lawyers during the 
Clinton, 
Bush 
and 
Obama 

administrations, intended to 
review the major environmental 
challenges during each of their 
tenures as well as discuss the 
future of environmental policy 
in the Trump administration.

Stephanie 
Campbell, 

a graduate student in the 
School 
for 
Environment 

and 
Sustainability, 
said 

worries 
about 
the 
Trump 

administration drove her to 
come to the panel.

“When all this was coming 

down last fall, when we heard 
who won the election, there 
was a lot of worry and concern 
inside 
the 
environmental 

school 
especially 
regarding 

what this would mean,” she 
said. “This seemed like a good 
opportunity to get more of a 
practitioner’s perspective.”

Current 
law 
and 
rules 

promulgated 
by 
the

With 
close 
to 
60,000 

Americans diagnosed annually, 
Parkinson’s disease is the second-
most-common neurodegenerative 
disease in the United States 
following Alzheimer’s disease. 
With 
an 
elderly 
population, 

experts are predicting there will 
be an increasing prevalence of 
Parkinson’s disease with greater 
economic burdens on patients due 
to treatment and lifestyle changes.

At a Wednesday morning 

symposium 
held 
at 
the 

Biomedical 
Science 
Research 

Building, seven research experts 
discussed current Parkinson’s 
disease research and its clinical 
implications.

Parkinson’s 
disease 
is 
a 

neurodegenerative 
disorder 

resulting in loss of motor skills due 
to the progressive loss of dopamine 
in the brain, particularly the basal 
ganglia. The symptoms of the 
disease are often characterized 
by a tremor, rigidity, difficulty 
initiating movement and changes 
in balance. With the progressive 
death of brain cells, quality of life 
is also diminished.

The event was hosted by 

the 
University’s 
Morris 
K. 

Udall Center of Excellence for 
Parkinson’s Disease Research, 
one 
of 
nine 
such 
centers 

across the country, to promote 
understanding 
of 
advanced 

scientific research and, ultimately, 
its translation into cures for the 
disease.

The Udall group, supported 

by NIH National Institute of 
Neurological 
Disorders 
and 

Stroke, was founded in 1997 after 
former Congressman Morris K. 
Udall, who worked in Congress 
despite 
a 
long 
battle 
with 

Parkinson’s disease until 1991. He 
died from the disease in 1998.

Neurologist and researcher 

William 
Dauer 
directs 
the 

University’s Udall Center.

“My personal interest is in 

understanding 
fundamental 

mechanisms of disease as a 
necessary first step to devise 
new ways to treat them, at a 
minimum to reduce the impact 
of neurological disease on people 
by making the symptoms better,” 
Dauer said. “The long-term goal 
would be to devise ways to halt 
the progress of disease so many 
of these symptoms don’t develop 
at all.”

Dauer 
spoke 
about 
the 

University’s 
Udall 
Center 

focusing in particular on gait 
difficulties that emerge later in 
the progression of Parkinson’s 
disease. Augmenting cholinergic 
signals related to gait problems are 
being tested to delay symptoms 
associated with walking.

“It would mean a huge amount 

to patients if the problems in 
walking either didn’t happen or 
was delayed. The difficulty is a

she believes the program is

Exploring the similarities between internment camps and post 9/11 discrimination

In February 1942, President 

Franklin 
Delano 
Roosevelt 

issued Executive Order 9066, 
relocating all people of Japanese 
ancestry in the United States, 
documented and undocumented, 

into internment camps. Fast-
forward 75 years, and Arab and 
Muslim Americans are facing 
discrimination 
in 
ways 
that 

resonate with the memories of 
Japanese-Americans.

The internment of Japanese-

Americans 
followed 
the 

Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor 
in December of 1941. Nearly 

120,000 
Japanese-Americans 

were sent to the internment 
camps, roughly two-thirds of 
whom were native-born citizens 
in the United States.

Japanese-Americans spent, on 

average, three years in the camps, 
living in cramped barracks, often 
with only a single working light 
bulb.

Anti-Japanese 
sentiment 

was high before the attack on 
Pearl Harbor, and even higher 
afterward. 
The 
Japanese 

relocation 
to 
internment 

camps was met with nearly no 
opposition by the non-Japanese-
American population.

In November of 2016, shortly

today 
seem

Last 
Thursday, 
Amazon 

announced its plan to build 
a 
second 
headquarters 

somewhere in North America, 
and released a request for 
proposal for interested cities 
to complete.

Many 
have 
suggested 

Detroit as a potential location, 
and University of Michigan 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

added his support to the bid 
this week.

“We’re a research machine 

with an enormous array of 
faculty doing work of relevance 
to the types of businesses that 
Amazon is in,” he said Monday 
in an interview with The 
Detroit News. “We’re a source 
of educated talent for whom 
Amazon here in Michigan 

might be an employer of 
choice.”

The 
current 
Amazon 

campus in Seattle, Wash., 
employs more than 40,000 

people, comprises 33 buildings 
with more than 8.1 million 
square feet and has injected 
about $38 billion into the local 
economy. 
Amazon 
founder 

and CEO Jeff Bezos expects 
the second headquarters “to 
be a full equal to our Seattle 
headquarters.”

John Roach, spokesperson 

for 
the 
Detroit 
Mayor’s 

office, released a statement 
that “as to Amazon’s request 
for proposals for a second 
headquarters, 
we 
will 
be 

evaluating carefully.”

Gov. Rick Snyder touted the 

state as an ideal destination as 
well.

“Not only is Michigan a top-

10 state for doing business and 
attracting 25- to 34-year-olds, 
our workforce is growing at a 
higher rate than the national 
average and we lead the region 
in inbound migration for those 
with bachelor’s degrees or 
higher,” he said in a statement.

The RFP is open until Oct. 

19, 2017, and Amazon expects 
to make a decision in 2018.

The University of Michigan’s 

place in multiple rankings this 
year remained unchanged, with a 
few individual programs making 
advances. 

As in 2016, University placed as 

the fourth-best public university 
in this year’s U.S. News & World 
Report rankings released Tuesday, 
and 28th in the country overall, 
down one spot from last year. 
The ratings use quantitative and 
qualitative factors to generate 
scores, compiling 15 d ifferent 
elements such as alumni giving 
rates, faculty resources and 
admissions selectivity.

U.S. News also ranked 

the University’s business and 
engineering schools within the top 
10 of undergraduate programs.

The Ross School of Business’s 

undergraduate program moved 
into a tie for third in the nation, 
up one point from last year. Ross is 
also among the top five schools in 
accounting, finance, management, 

marketing and production/
operation management. 

The College of Engineering, 

meanwhile, tied for sixth in 
undergraduate programs, also 
up one position from last year. 
Its aerospace, environmental, 
industrial/manufacturing, 
materials, electrical and 
mechanical programs are ranked in 
the top five national programs.

Earlier this year, the University 

placed as the number one public 
university in the nation, and 
ranked 21st overall in the QS World 
Rankings, moving up two spots 
from 23rd last year. QS considers 
university performance in areas 
including employability, research 
and teaching. The rankings are 
determined by six major factors: 
employer reputation, academic 
reputation, research citations per 
faculty, international faculty rating, 
international student ratio and 
student-to-faculty ratio.

Thursday, September 14, 2017 — 3A

has determined climate change 
poses a threat to the health and 
well-being of the citizens it 
serves. That decision was made 
in 2007 in a Supreme Court case, 
Massachusetts v. EPA, in which 
the court decided, 5-4, that if 
the EPA made such a finding of 
endangerment, it was obligated 
to regulate greenhouse gases 
under the Clean Air Act.

One of the panelists, Roger 

Martella, was serving as EPA 
general counsel under former 
President George Bush when 
the decision was handed down. 
The decision came as a complete 
surprise to Martella: Rather than 
trying to act on climate change 
with existing laws, Martella said, 
the general expectation was that 
Congress would first have to pass 
new ones.

“This is all probably totally 

understood, second nature to 
everybody today — 2007 doesn’t 
seem like it was that long ago, 
but it was 10 years ago,” he said. 
“This kind of shocked everyone’s 
universe. Environmental lawyers 
will say they were thinking about 
it, but the regulatory community 

in the federal government didn’t 
have any preparation for the 
fact that we might actually be 
addressing climate change based 
on existing laws as opposed 
to waiting for Congress to do 
something.”

Following the decision, he 

said, Bush favored making a big 
push to begin regulation, but 
concerns quickly arose about 
the viability of passing such 
complicated regulations in the 
short period of time Bush had left 
in his second term.

The Clean Air Act, passed by 

Congress in 1963, was designed 
to regulate specific and localized 
air pollutants like lead, ozone and 
particulate matter. Greenhouse 
gases — which are emitted by 
every gasoline- and diesel-fueled 
vehicle on the road –– were not in 
the initial picture.x

When Avi Garbow — one of the 

panelists — arrived at the EPA 
as the Obama administration’s 
deputy general counsel, though 
he was later promoted to general 
counsel. His first task, after 
verifying the integrity of the 
science behind the endangerment 
finding, 
was 
promulgating 

regulations to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions.

The EPA’s first target was 

mobile 
source 
emissions, 
or 

emissions from vehicles, which 
Garbow said were relatively easy, 
as they were predicated near 
fuel-efficiency standards, which 
allow people to save money on 
gas. Garbow added that states 
also carried some of the burden 
of regulation.

“The statute allowed the state 

of California, given some factors 
that were ostensibly peculiar to 
it — its size — to issue its own 
regulations and standards,” he 
said. “The world’s automakers 
want to be able to sell cars not 
just in California, but elsewhere, 
so it really brought parties 
together to try to make sure that 
there were uniform standards. 
You can’t put out a Nissan Sentra 
that’s compliant in California 
and a totally different one that’s 
compliant in Virginia.”

Once the EPA began to shift 

toward 
regulating 
stationary 

sources of greenhouse gases, 
like forcing power companies 
to implement more renewable 
energy, though, the public wasn’t 
as supportive.

But the concept of the EPA 

regulating 
greenhouse 
gases 

began long before that. After a 
tense encounter during a House 
appropriations hearing, Jonathan 

Cannon, a panelist and general 
counsel to the EPA during the 
Clinton administration, became 
the lawyer in charge of providing 
the initial legal argument that 
the EPA had the authority to 
regulate greenhouse gases.

“My boss, Carol Browner, who 

was an administrator, was there 
testifying on the agency budget,” 
Cannon 
said. 
“Tom 
DeLay, 

who was the majority whip at 
that time, came blustering into 
the hearing with some EPA 
document that he’d gotten and 
he accosted the administrator 
with his document in a question 
saying, ‘Do you take the position 
that the EPA has the authority 
to address climate change under 
the CAA?’ And she said, ‘Yes, 
I believe it does.’ And he said, 
‘Well I would like a legal opinion 
on that issue.’ And she turned to 
me and said, ‘Yes, a legal opinion 
will be forthcoming.’ She had not 
talked to me before that. I didn’t 
have an opinion at that point.”

Though there is widespread 

concern 
over 
the 
intentions 

of the Trump administration 
and EPA Administrator Scott 
Pruitt regarding climate action, 
Cannon said that as long as the 
endangerment finding remains 
valid, the current administration 

can’t 
institute 
any 
dramatic 

change.

“So far — and I could be wrong 

— but my best information is 
that so far, the administration 
has not moved to withdraw the 
endangerment finding,” he said. 
“EPA Administrator Pruitt has 
talked about some sort of science 
review process that presumably 
could lead up to that, but right 
now they’re not disturbing that, 
which means they have a set 
of legal issues related to the 
existence of that endangerment 
finding on the books, upheld by 
the D.C. circuit, creating certain 
obligations under the clean air 
act or arguably so.”

The other panelists agreed that 

while there is cause for concern, 
there are procedural roadblocks 
in the administration’s way that 
would slow any drastic actions, 
and actions outside the federal 
government could still outweigh 
those.

Despite 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s decision to leave the 
Paris climate accord, Garbow 
pointed out, due to provisions 
within the accord, the earliest the 
United States could withdraw is 
Nov. 4, 2020 –– one day after the 
next presidential election. And 
Martella — currently the general 

counsel for General Electric’s 
Environment, Health and Safety 
division — said “business is doing 
what it needs to do” on climate 
change.

Cannon agreed, stating he was 

hopeful for the future.

“The hopeful thing is that 

as the current administration 
abdicates this place and begins to 
withdraw these regulations there 
are a lot of things happening 
outside the federal regulatory 
sphere,” he said. “So, although 
regulation 
will 
remain 
an 

important component, these are 
hopeful signs, and I think we all 
ought to think about ways we can 
support, foster and extend these 
trends in a way that may make 
what Washington does, at least 
for the moment, less crucial.”

Campbell said she came away 

from the panel having had her 
faith in the legal system restored.

“I thought what was really 

interesting was ... that we can’t 
just depend on our political 
system to solve all of our 
problems and put all of our eggs 
in that one basket, but that it is 
also about community action at 
the local and regional levels that 
really can drive climate change 
action forward, so there’s a lot of 
hope there,” she said.

interested in sciences, she recalls 
preferring a hands-on research 
approach to learning about said 
interests.

“I realized more and more 

what I wanted to do was work at 
the nexus of human-environment 
interactions … be the person 
thinking about what actions we 
take, how do we do things, how 
we make policies,” Taylor said. 
“The 
field 
of 
environmental 

sociology focuses on the social 
aspect of how humans interact 
with the environment.”

Taylor’s 
research 
has 

concentrated on social factors 
such as race, gender and class, 
and their subsequent relation to 
environmental issues. She noted 
these components play into how 
various demographics are affected 

by the environmental obstacles 
we 
face 
today, 
exemplifying 

the recent hurricanes as one of 
many instances in which the 
consequences are exponentially 
higher 
for 
poorer, 
minority 

communities.

“You do get to see some of the 

invisible institutional structures 
or barriers, especially when you 
look at these things historically,” 
she said.

Taylor 
has 
authored 
both 

research reports and books, “Food 
Availability and the Food Desert 
Frame in Detroit: An Overview 
of the City’s Food System” (2015) 
and “The Rise of the American 
Conservation Movement: Power, 
Privilege, 
and 
Environmental 

Protection” (2016) and various 
similar works that explore social 
issues and their relation to the 
environment.

In addition to her work as a 

professor, author and researcher, 

Taylor is the University director 
of the Doris Duke Conservation 
Scholars 
Program, 
a 
two-

year internship and research 
program 
for 
undergraduate 

students, including those of other 
universities, who are otherwise 
inadequately represented in the 
environmental and conservation 
field.

This past year, the second-

year students were taken to 
the U.S. Virgin Islands to learn 
about different ecosystems in a 
hands-on learning experience 
that combined the hard science of 
survey data and actual interaction 
with communities there.

So 
far, 
60 
students 
have 

gone 
through 
the 
program, 

and 
Taylor 
emphasized 
the 

myriad 
opportunities 
made 

known 
to 
these 
students 

following 
this 
experience, 

including recruitments to the 
University. Additionally, Taylor 

is the principal investigator of the 
Environmental Fellows Program, 
which helps fund the expenses 
of graduate school and prepares 
students to be financially secure 
at their completion of school, 
with experience in the job market 
and networking.

“These fellowship programs 

are a direct result of the research 
that we have done on diversity, 
with the 2014 report (most 
commonly referenced as Green 
2.0 report), a group of graduate 
students helped me collect the 
data and we put out the national 
report. It’s been a game changer, 
with 
the 
garnered 
publicity 

we have been able to have 
organizations open up positions 
to hire students,” Taylor said.

Taylor is also the director of 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
program 
for 
the 
School 
of 

Environment, where her tasks 
range from incorporating more 

inclusive teaching techniques in 
classrooms to helping recruit a 
more diverse base of students.

“At 
an 
elite 
university 

like 
Michigan, 
we 
have 
to 

ask ourselves: Are we only a 
university for the rich? Or are 
we going to take the mandate of 
public education seriously? If we 
do, then it behooves all of us to 
think about ways of broadening 
the audience we reach, the 
students that get an opportunity 
to come to schools like ours,” she 
said.

Taylor 
noted 
the 
growing 

popularity of her undergraduate 
courses on food justice and 
insecurity, claiming that close to 
500 undergraduates have gone 
out to participate in and do their 
own research.

“It’s been really quite amazing, 

both in terms of being able to 
teach and having students get 
really excited about this topic,” 

Taylor said.

An example of such students 

includes University alum and 
current Ypsilanti Mayor Amanda 
Edmonds, who took the course on 
food systems and later moved on 
to create the nonprofit Growing 
Hope, a program that helps 
communities cultivate consistent 
access to healthy food.

Taylor’s 
food 
project 
has 

additionally funded community 
gardens 
in 
Ypsilanti, 
Flint, 

Grand Rapids and Lake Superior 
State. For the past five years, 
they have supported community 
gardens that provide plots for low 
income residents, and each year 
has yielded food for at least 20 
families.

“There are a lot of very 

practical ways in which these 
research papers translate in a way 
that it positively impacts the lives 
of students and the lives of the 
community folks,” Taylor said.

setting that requires the practical 
application of their valuable 
language skills to work with 
organizations 
in 
Washtenaw 

County committed to a social 
cause,” Andrasko wrote.

In the initial planning stages, 

the team created a proposal 
to develop an app to provide 
its users an easier way to find 
nutritious foods in Washtenaw 
County. However, since they 
lacked the coding knowledge 
to design an app, they instead 
explored other options. 

Around the same time, the 

team started making trips to 
the Bryant Community Center, 
one of their community center 
partners. 
Here, 
they 
saw 

firsthand a need for something 
like LingoMatch. 

“It 
has 
been 
especially 

rewarding to see firsthand how 
excited 
Bryant 
Community 

Center clients are to be able 
to speak their native language 
with volunteers, which shows 
how meaningful language can 
be in connecting people and 
promoting an environment of 
inclusivity,” Andrasko wrote.

Since its launch, the program 

has 
already 
hosted 
several 

projects, including the most 
recent, which involved volunteers 
translating a booklet on how 
undocumented immigrants can 
best protect their families during 
immigration 
raids. 
Another 

project 
was 
assisting 
those 

who do not speak English as 
their first language during food 
distribution days at food banks.

Furthermore, the program 

plans to provide students with 
valuable volunteering and cross-
cultural 
language 
experience 

in addition to providing clients 
with a safe and confidential 
space where they can ask any 
individual questions about the 
application process while getting 
personalized assistance in their 

native language.

Though LingoMatch is still 

in its initial phases, the team 
members are very optimistic for 
its potential growth.

“At the end of the day, making 

and seeing an actual impact is 
the true goal,” Andrasko wrote.

LSA junior Timberlee Whiteus 

believes the program is beneficial 
since it focuses on marginalized 
citizens.

“It is imperative to make 

refugees feel comfortable as 
many have come from troubled 
areas,” Whiteus said.

Andrasko agreed, noting the 

social signifiance of volunteering 
with the program as well. 

“We provide interpretation 

services for community centers 
that have a clear commitment to 
a social cause, such as working 
with food banks, immigration 
law 
firms 
or 
resettlement 

agencies,” 
Andrasko 
wrote. 

“We act as a bridge between the 
organization and the potential 
student volunteers at U of M.”

after he was elected, Trump 
suggested the possibility of a 
Muslim registry and in January 
of this year, Trump pushed 
for a ban on travel from seven 
majority-Muslim countries.

LSA 
senior 
Haleemah 

Aqel, 
Islamophobia 
Working 

Group 
student 
coordinator, 

has 
experienced 
forms 
of 

discrimination she likened to 
that 
of 
Japanese-Americans 

during World War II. Despite 
that, she did note “the severity 
of our discriminations are on 
different levels.”

“You sometimes feel as if 

you don’t belong because of 
certain policies, certain wars 
and especially this year with the 
Muslim registry. I have definitely 
felt as if I’ve questioned, ‘Am 
I 
really 
American?’” 
Aqel 

said. “We kind of all just feel 
sometimes as if we don’t belong.”

“The Japanese race is an 

enemy race,” wrote Lieutenant 
General John DeWitt in 1942 
in the Final Report: Japanese 
Evacuation 
from 
the 
West 

Coast. “While many second and 
third generation Japanese born 
on American soil, possessed 
of American citizenship, have 
become 
‘Americanized,’ 
the 

racial strains are undiluted.”

Roosevelt 
justified 
the 

internment 
of 
Japanese-

Americans by deeming them a 
threat to national security and 
labeled them “enemy aliens.”

Japanese-Americans 
have 

recognized similarities between 
the 
oppression 
they 
and 

generations before them faced 
during World War II and the 
oppression Arab and Muslim 
Americans face. The similarities 
in 
oppression 
have 
pushed 

Japanese-Americans to stand 
up for the rights of Arab and 
Muslim Americans.

Matthew Stiffler, a researcher 

at the Arab American National 
Museum and lecturer at the 
University of Michigan, noticed 
the alliance form in the early ’90s, 
long before the announcement 
of the immigration ban from the 

majority-Muslim countries.

“The Japanese and the Arab 

community 
specifically 
and 

the Japanese and the Muslim 
community more broadly has 
had an affinity not just since the 
announcement of the Muslim 
ban in January, but going back 
a lot further,” Stiffler said. “So 
the first case that I found of 
cooperation was in 1991. That 
was the run up to the first Gulf 
War in Iraq.”

Stiffler added the support 

for 
the 
Arab 
and 
Muslim 

American communities started 
with 
a 
Japanese-American 

congressman.

“And during that time, the 

FBI was going around and 
interviewing 
Arab 
American 

community leaders about the 
run-up to the war in Iraq and 
a Japanese-American, he was 
a Congressman at the time, 
former 
Secretary 
Norman 

Mineta, spoke out very publicly 
against this, as a Japanese-
American himself, whose family 
was incarcerated during World 
War II,” Stiffler said. “He said 
we’re not going to go down that 
road again.”

Aqel said alliances between 

minority groups have more 
power than one group standing 
on its own.

“This 
alliance 
and 

connections 
and 
solidarity 

networks between groups have 
been formed specifically since I 
think a lot of people of color have 
noticed that this discrimination 
against them is so high that 
sometimes we … think that 
doing 
things 
by 
ourselves 

won’t go anywhere but forming 
alliances will allow both of our 
movements, both our voices, our 
people to expand for others to 
hear our struggle,” Aqel said.

LSA 
junior 
Maureen 

O’Bryan, the co-event chair 
for 
the 
Japanese 
Student 

Association, wrote in an email 
interview 
that 
connecting 

Japanese 
discrimination 
to 

the discrimination of Arab and 
Muslim Americans today puts 
their reality in context.

“It’s 
powerful 
because 

Japanese-Americans 
have 

(experienced) this and we say 

never again should this happen,” 
O’Bryan wrote. “I think if 
the 
Trump 
administration 

really wants to use Japanese 
incarceration as precedent for 
his Muslim ban, he’s going to 
see a strengthening alliance 
between 
these 
two 
groups 

because we’re not going to let 
what happened to us be used 
against another minority group 
that is a supposed ‘threat’ to 
national security because it was 
found that Japanese-Americans 
did not pose any threat to the 
U.S. during WWII.”

Stiffler has personally seen 

the alliance through his work 
at the Arab American National 
Museum. 
The 
museum 
has 

close ties with the Japanese 
American 
National 
Museum 

in Los Angeles, which helped 
train some of the employees at 
the Arab American National 
Museum when it opened in 
2005.

“We’ve 
shared 
exhibits, 

we’ve hosted their staff here for 
workshops, we’ve shared ideas. 
So we feel that we’re very closely 
aligned with them,” Stiffler 
said. “We call them our sister 
museum, just because there is 
that shared history both what 
it’s like to be an ethnic group in 
the U.S. today but also an ethnic 
group that has been targeted 
for civil rights violations by the 
federal government.”

There has been coordination 

between 
the 
two 
groups 

on 
campus, 
according 
to 

O’Bryan. She said she saw 
the alliance strengthen last 
year 
following 
the 
election 

and the announcement of the 
immigration ban.

“Just recently the Lebanese 

Student Association reached out 
to collaborate with the Japan 
Student Association, and as the 
external chair for JSA I plan 
on pursuing this relationship,” 
O’Bryan wrote. “I am hoping 
that this friendship between 
these two groups will continue 
to grow on our campus and all 
around the country. Even if it 
is the Muslim ban that brought 
us together, I hope even after 
it is hopefully defeated we can 
maintain a stronger alliance.”

major milestone in Parkinson’s 
disease where quality of life goes 
down, mortality goes up, injuries go 
up — hip fractures, skull fractures, 
things like that,” he said.

“(The symposium) is one of 

many concrete mechanisms by 
which we can get people in the 
common space to begin talking 
about these different ideas,” Dauer 
said.

He said the center’s goal is 

“to foster dialogue so people 
with different perspectives can 
challenge each other so that we 
can come up with ideas that are not 
obvious to one discipline by itself. 
It’s sort of analogous to the idea 
of neurochemicals — how do they 
interact to create unique things?”

Speakers for the event included 

researchers 
from 
various 

departments at the University, 
like the Department of Biomedical 
Engineering, as well as researchers 
from Michigan State University. 
Presentations included molecular 

research 
to 
optimize 
animal 

models, 
as 
well 
as 
imaging 

techniques to better understand 
the structures and mechanisms 
involved in Parkinson’s disease.

In addition to inviting leading 

researchers to the University from 
local and national institutions, 
Dauer emphasized the importance 
of educating the future generation 
in 
research. 
The 
symposium 

series provides a place for younger 
researchers to present research 
findings, engaging in the larger 
research community.

“We saw this line drawn 

between 
these 
presentations, 

which 
was 
really 
interesting, 

but of course we all use different 
techniques and strategies to get 
at these questions,” said Matthew 
Gaidica, 
a 
neuroscience Ph.D 

candidate, in his presentation. 
“Bringing those people together 
— the ones that think about 
molecules and chemicals and the 
ones that think about circuits 
and motor behavior — is really 
important because we’re attacking 
this disease on multiple fronts.”

Samuel 
Pappas, 
research 

investigator and post-doctorate in 
the Dauer Lab, echoed Gaidica’s 
sentiments on the importance of 
diversity in research.

“There 
was 
everything 

from molecular work in new 
animal 
models 
to 
(positron 

emission tomography) imaging 
in humans and really modern 
electrophysiology 
and 
new 

techniques,” 
Pappas 
said. 
“I 

thought it was a great depth and 
breadth of research and gave a nice 
cross-section of the different types 
of research that are done.”

Dauer emphasized the relevance 

of 
interdisciplinary 
work 
in 

tackling complex diseases like 
Parkinson’s.

“We want people to interact 

so they can come up with ideas 
that are not obvious to either one 
alone,” he said. “This is a long-term 
problem — we hope we can make 
a dent in it, but we ain’t going to 
solve the whole thing. We need 
absolutely to educate people.”

N

ot 
long 
ago, 
when 

iPods could effortlessly 
moonlight 
as 
bricks 

with buttons and the term 
“millennial” had not yet been 
spoken into existence, baseball 
was all the rage. Before I had 
turned 11, I had spent four 
birthdays at Yankee Stadium 
and collected a rosters’ worth of 
ice cream-holding mini-helmets 
to boot. From kindergarten to 
sixth grade, highlights from the 
night before would interrupt 
my breakfast. The school day 
brought arguments about the 
pennant race and card trading. 
In the evening, there was 
wiffleball, which graduated to 
T-ball, then Little League, travel 
baseball and so forth. 

None of these experiences in 

my childhood would be too out 
of the ordinary for any young fan 
hungry for sports. But something 
irksome happened as I entered 
my teen years. Baseball became 
less of a presence in my life and 
in the lives of almost everyone 
around me. My meals slowly won 
the morning competition with 
the highlight reel, my previously 
heated 
arguments 
about 
Cy 

Young 
and 
the 
designated 

hitter cooled and, one by one, 
my friends stepped away from 
the diamond. I myself stopped 
playing at the end of junior high, 
and my interest in baseball soon 
waned as well.

Growing up seemed to me to 

be the leading factor in baseball’s 
steady decline. The junior high 
and high school years are times 
for kids to meet new friends 
and explore a world gradually 
opening itself up. Yet in my 
corner of New Jersey suburbia, 
an interest in baseball became 
not just an afterthought, but a 
relic of the past.

Sure, the thought went, the 

years of card-collecting and 
backyard wiffleball always have 
a spot in our hearts, but they 
were nothing more than any 
plain old interest of our younger 
years. The days of being a fervent 
disciple of all things baseball may 
as well be known as “the baseball 

days,” and binders brimming 
with Topps and Upper Deck 
cards took up a new residence 
next to a box of Silly Bandz and 
snapback hats.

Baseball and baseball culture, 

though, is making a resurgence. 
The kids who fondly remember 
Kerry 
Wood’s 
20-strikeout 

game or Aaron Boone’s walk-off 
homerun in the ALCS to send 
the Yankees to the World Series 
have begun to resurface in the 
baseball world. Nearly 8.7 million 
people tuned into the 2017 Home 
Run Derby, MLB revenues are 
approaching a record $10 billion 
and viewership for playoff-bound 
teams is on the rise.

On a more grassroots level, 

I have noticed that many of my 
own 
friends 
will 
mirthfully 

make their way to the stadium 
and share their time at the game 
on social media. Baseball games 
after work, on the weekends or 
as a way to spend a night out are 
slowly creeping out from a lull 
and into the nostalgia-fueled 
interest of young people.

The lynchpin preventing more 

encouraging figures of millennial 
engagement or game attendance 
is a common one for a generation 
that 
feels 
“significantly 
less 

financially secure than baby 
boomer parents:” the price. Most 
obviously, teams can improve 
by reducing ticket prices. The 
New York Yankees, who have an 
average ticket price of $106.05, 
second only to the reigning 
champion Chicago Cubs, have 
seen a per-game decline of 
3,793 people through May 25 of 
this year, the third-sharpest in 
baseball. Meanwhile, the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, with tickets 
averaging $44.99, the fourth-
lowest in the MLB, have had a 
league-leading 
average 
game 

attendance of 46,302. The St. 
Louis Cardinals boast the second-
highest attendance at 42,584.

The other expense to trim 

is 
the 
glaringly 
overpriced 

concessions. One team model to 
consider after this year may wind 
up being the Atlanta Falcons of 
the National Football League. 

Last month, the Falcons unveiled 
their 
new 
“fan-friendly” 

concession prices, which include 
$2 water bottles, $2 hot dogs and 
$5 beer. If a complete overhaul 
of the concession stands is not 
in Major League Baseball’s best 
interests, frequent promos for 
similar “fan-friendly” concession 
prices could entice new fans to 
come to the ballpark.

Finally, continuing to advertise 

through social media will help 
connect a younger audience 
to baseball and its rising stars. 
Teams have found recent success 
in using Twitter to engage fans 
with highlights and entertaining 
moments. Likewise, promotions, 
like the Tampa Bay Rays’ “DJ 
Kitty Onesie” night have used 
culture to their advantage in 
piquing more youthful interest. 
Marketing young league stars 
is another area where the MLB 
ought to improve if they want 
to win over the 18-to-35-year-
old demographic. Promisingly, 
teams seem to have begun to take 
notice of the need to promote its 
young stars, like the Yankees’ 
Aaron Judge, in popular media 
and culture.

Still, much popular media and 

culture today would have one 
believe that millennials have 
fallen victim to the information 
and technology age and are 
thereby crippling long-standing 
industries like baseball. But 
in the millennial generation, 
Major League Baseball has a 
unique, golden opportunity. The 
millennial appetite — an appetite 
that is predominantly anecdotal, 
but also backed by research — that 
values experience and nostalgia 
intersects perfectly with the best 
of what baseball offers. Moving 
into the 21st century and offering 
a more fan-oriented experience 
with 
modern 
and 
creative 

advertising will help the MLB 
tap into a trove of a generation’s 
love for baseball — the same love 
that thankfully has recently been 
rekindled in me.

S

cotch and vodka. Two 
different types of alcohol 
that, 
when 
consumed 

individually, 
are 

tolerable and even 
enjoyable.

Yet, 
“scotchka,” 

the mixture of these 
two drinks, is not 
enjoyable 
or 
even 

tolerable. 
Scotchka 

is 
disgusting, 

because 
combining 

equal parts scotch 
and vodka does not 
create a “beverage.” 
It creates a liquid tragedy — a 
cloudy iced tea look-alike with 
the aroma of paint thinner that, 
if consumed, is guaranteed to 
induce panic to your liver. 

Therefore, 
no 
sensible 

person with even a beginner’s 
knowledge of alcohol would 
ever think to make a glass 
of scotchka. They know that 
certain things just do not mix.

Which makes it amusing 

that, despite nearly decades 
of prior knowledge of the 
countless family fights due 
to the topic of politics, one 
of my family members will 
eventually inquire to the group, 
“Hey guys, how ‘bout that 
(extremely divisive political 
topic that is guaranteed to 
start a screaming match)?”

Mixing family with politics 

is painful. From the single-
family 
unit 
to 
the 
mass 

gatherings of relatives, the 
multiple 
viewpoints 
and 

positions of your loved ones 
often 
mutate 
into 
harsh 

accusations 
and 
arguments 

that never end well. I have been 
to quite a few graduations, 
baptisms, weddings, birthdays 
and just casual dinners that 
have descended into battles 
full of vulgar insults, Alex 
Jones-ian rants and far too 
many examples that use some 
iteration of “back in my day.”

There are several reasons 

why political dialogue within 
the family is so difficult. From 
generational gaps to different 
lifestyles and experiences, the 
political 
ideologies 
held 
by 

our family members become 

all the more divisive because 
the emotional stakes are far 
greater. Your view of a loved one 

becomes 
muddled 

when their ideology 
does not match your 
own. There arises 
a conflict in which 
you 
struggle 
with 

understanding 
how 

you can love someone 
you see as undeniably 
wrong on a clear 
moral issue. 

Politics 
become 

amplified within the 

family when these ideologies 
do not match, and it becomes 
extremely difficult to hold 
civil conversations on issues 
that are even slightly political. 
The squeamishness and hot 
tempers that are so often tied 
to politics have only further 
increased 
in 
intensity 
due 

to the chaotic nature of our 
current political environment.

Because, surprisingly, the 

result of the 2016 election 
did not mend the nation back 
together. 
Our 
TV-reality-

star-turned-president 
has 

only further led the country 
into the divisive politics that 
plague 
the 
United 
States’ 

progression. Each side of the 
political spectrum is becoming 
more and more filled as the 
moderate middle evaporates. 
And with the average news 
week filled with so many 
divisive and chaotic stories, 
it’s as if Aaron Sorkin teamed 
up with methamphetamine to 
write a twisted “precedent to 
the apocalypse” season of “The 
West Wing.”

It is truly disturbing that 

I can no longer use facts and 
truths 
in 
discussions 
with 

family 
members 
who 
have 

ultimately decided that they 
refuse 
to 
believe 
anything 

that does not adhere to their 
ideologies, and that I now have 
to 
have 
discussions 
where 

the facts don’t matter, where 
everything is entirely based 
on opinions, where personal 
feelings supersede truth.

This combination of divisive 

times, rejection of facts and 

constant news has degraded 
the political communication of 
this country to the point that 
simple family discussions on a 
particular issue can erupt into 
emotional arguments. The 2016 
election and its results have 
almost permanently divided 
families. And although politics 
and family never mixed well 
before, the loaded anger on 
both sides seems always ready 
to bubble over; the consistent 
amount of chaotic news allows 
for ample opportunities to 
start a screaming melee at the 
next family outing.

Political discussions should 

be hard — they are complex 
and involve emotional issues. 
And 
speaking 
about 
these 

topics with loved ones should 
be harder to do than with 
strangers. But it is a testament 
to the times of how divisive the 
U.S. has become when politics 
are near impossible to discuss 
at the dinner table.

Yet as much as it pains 

me, family and politics may 
be where the change occurs. 
That 
somewhere 
on 
the 

other end of these screaming 
matches and slammed doors, 
love and family bonds will 
overcome the divisive hate 
plaguing our country. That 
we can somehow, with calm, 
cool, collected manners, find 
a way to communicate again 
and reverse the polarization, 
at least on the family level.

If not, I am more than 

likely going to be downing 
scotchkas to get through the 
next family party.

FROM THE DAILY

Protect DACA recipients

A

nti-Latinx, pro-Trump graffiti was found on the Rock at the 
corner of Hill and Washtenaw on Sept. 1, defacing what Assisting 
Latinos to Maximize Achievement, a Latinx student organization, 

had recently painted. Three days later, Attorney General Jeff Sessions 
announced the current administration would terminate former President 
Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The 
decision would retract the immigration status of some 800,000 DACA 
recipients — 90 percent of whom identify as Hispanic or Latinx. That 
night, University President Mark Schlissel and Provost Martin Philbert 
sent an email expressing disappointment with the White House’s decision, 
emphasizing this decision’s weight on our campus. The Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board believes that President Donald Trump’s handling of 
DACA is unacceptable, and we call on Congress to pass legislation to stop 
DACA recipients from being deported, and work toward a structurally 
better solution for DACA recipients.

Detractors of DACA, which 

gave work permits and some 
protections against deportation 
to undocumented immigrants 
brought to the United States as 
children, view it as executive 
overreach and see a termination 
of the program as a return to rule 
of law. Additionally, Trump’s 
decision was spurred in part 
because 10 states had threatened 
to file a lawsuit against the 
Trump administration if it didn’t 
repeal the program. However, the 
context of the decision implies 
that the president’s stance on 
the issue was fueled purely by 
political considerations, rather 
than a firm resolve to provide 
a long-term solution for DACA 
recipients.

Many 
defenders 
of 
the 

immigration 
policy 
have 

made strong cases on the 
potential economic downfalls 
of deporting DACA recipients 
— 
arguing 
they 
contribute 

much to the nation’s economy 
and many are either pursuing 
degrees in higher education or 
serving in the armed forces. 
However, 
the 
humanitarian 

implications of Trump’s repeal 
are even more pressing.

DACA 
recipients 
were 

children when they immigrated 
to the United States and didn’t 
have a choice in the matter. 
They grew up in this country 
and are American in every 
sense if not by law. As such, 
they do not have connections 
in their parents’ homeland. 
Deporting 
DACA 
recipients 

would result in sending them to 
foreign lands they have never 
known. Many would be sent 

back to countries where they 
have no homes or jobs; it would 
completely uproot them from 
their American lifestyles.

University 
of 
Michigan 

students would be naive to 
believe rescinding DACA would 
not have an impact on their 
community. There are about 
6,430 people who receive DACA 
protections in Michigan, some of 
whom are Ann Arbor residents, 
University students or both, and 
their deportation would be cruel. 
The University has vocalized 
its commitment to protecting 
undocumented students through 
policies like not inquiring about 
students’ citizenship status. Still, 
Trump’s decision would directly 
endanger the immigration status 
of students on our campus.

DACA 
was 
never 
meant 

to be a permanent fix for 
undocumented 
children. 

Enacted in 2012 by executive 
order, DACA was supposed 
to be a bandage solution until 
Congress 
could 
provide 
a 

permanent, legislative solution. 
DACA 
recipients 
were 
still 

required to reapply for the 
program 
every 
two 
years, 

with no clear path outlined 
regarding 
the 
transition 
to 

citizenship. 
Furthermore, 
as 

it was an executive order, the 
program was always vulnerable 
to 
easy 
repeal 
by 
future 

administrations.

Following 
the 
president’s 

decision to terminate DACA, 
Congress now has six months 
to provide a solution for DACA 
recipients. Now, Congress has 
the opportunity to create a 
more sustainable pathway to 

citizenship, something it has not 
been able to do in the five years 
since the program began.

There are currently three 

proposed pieces of legislation 
put forward in Congress that 
could be potential solutions. The 
Bar Removal of Individuals Who 
Dream and Grow Our Economy 
Act, the Recognizing America’s 
Children Act and a 2017 version 
of the Development, Relief, and 
Education for Alien Minors 
Act. Any of these bills would 
provide some sort of legislative 
protections from deportation 
to DACA recipients. We call on 
Congress to pass one of these 
bills, or something similar, to 
defend DACA recipients.

The decision to repeal DACA 

has the potential to affect 
the lives of nearly a million 
Americans and must not be 
taken 
lightly. 
The 
decision 

shakes a foundational pillar 
of the nation’s future, and the 
actions to follow in the next few 
months will play a huge role in 
determining the fate of DACA 
recipients. We must remember 
that we are dealing with human 
lives — not numbers or statistics.

Resources 
for 
DACA 

students may be found on the 
FAQs page of the University’s 
Public Affairs and Internal 
Communications 
website. 

Central Student Government 
has also posted information on 
social media relevant to certain 
DACA students able to renew 
their benefits. Independent law 
offices have also promised to aid 
in the financial and logistical 
difficulties 
with 
renewing 

their current status.

Bush, defense preparing for Air Force’s unique offense

The No. 7 Michigan football 

team (2-0) won’t see an offense 
like Air Force’s every week. 
For the most part, it’s an 
opportunity for the Wolverines 
to 
face 
an 
out-of-the-box 

scheme. 

Michigan’s 
upcoming 

opponent presents a unique 
challenge. The Falcons (1-0) 
run a triple-option style offense 
that is full of deceit, trick plays 
and 
an 
ever-changing 
run 

game.

Air Force had the third-

ranked rushing offense last 
season, averaging 317 rushing 
yards per game. In the Falcons’ 
season-opening 
win 
against 

Virginia 
Military 
Institute, 

they rushed for 473.

“It’s a well-run offense,” said 

sophomore linebacker Devin 
Bush Jr. “They’ve been running 
it for (11) years. … They know it 
down to the T, and they’re going 
to run it to their best ability.”

The Wolverines are 24-point 

favorites over Air Force, but in 
order to pick up a third straight 
win, they’ll need to stop an 
Air Force attack that is one of 
the best in the nation on the 
ground.

Bush 
and 

other members 
of the defense 
mentioned 
that 
staying 

disciplined 
was the most 
important 
factor. 
With 

so 
many 

different looks, 
the 
Falcons’ 

offense can lead 
defensive players into trying to 
make plays they shouldn’t. The 
Wolverines can’t afford to jump 
at the quarterback when he 
could toss a quick lateral pass to 
the trailing running back, who 

could beat them as well.

“It’s hard,” Bush said. “That’s 

one of the biggest things we’re 
gonna have to focus on — not 

doing too much. 
Not 
trying 
to 

always make that 
play. 
You 
have 

to 
trust 
your 

teammates.

“Do your job. 

Don’t try to do 
the next man’s 
job.”

Added 

sophomore safety 
Josh 
Metellus: 

“The triple-option offense is a 
lot. There’s a lot of deceiving 
plays; people going one way, 
and the ball going completely 
the other way.”

Playing in the secondary, the 

safeties aren’t as concerned 
with 
the 
triple 
option 
as 

some of the linebackers are, 
but Metellus noted that they 
have 
seen 
Air 

Force 
run 
a 

slew 
of 
play-

action 
passes. 

If the safeties 
and 
defensive 

backs get caught 
sleeping, 
the 

Falcons are well 
positioned 
to 

attack 
through 

the air as well.

Nonetheless, 

amidst all the triple-option 
talk, the Wolverines’ defense is 
still exceedingly confident.

“They’re not going to pass the 

ball too many times,” Bush said. 
“If they do, we got something 

for ‘em.”

So far, Michigan’s defense 

has scored more points than it 
has allowed.

The 
young 

guns like Bush 
and 
Metellus, 

as 
well 
as 

sophomores 
Lavert Hill and 
Khaleke Hudson, 
are 
breaking 

down opponents. 
And 
‘veterans’ 

like junior safety 
Tyree 
Kinnel 

and 
senior 

cornerback 
Brandon 
Watson 

are making the transition from 
last year’s star-studded defense 
practically seamless.

No matter how well the 

defense fared against Florida 

and Cincinnati, though, they 
admit that preparing for Air 
Force presents an entirely new 
challenge.

Defensive coordinator Don 

Brown 
has 
been 
preparing 

for this game since last April. 
The coaches talked about this 
game with players all offseason 
to make sure that they knew 
what to expect when this week 
arrived. Preparing for almost 
any other opponent wouldn’t 
call for a change in the game 
plan, and that’s why the Falcons 
are so dangerous.

“(Air Force) is just a different 

deal,” said Michigan secondary 
coach Mike Zordich. “What 
we have worked on from April 
through now, you just put that 
all aside, and you’re doing 
something totally different.”

Zordich also praised the 

scout team, as emulating Air 
Force’s running game is no easy 
task.

“Hats off to all our (graduate 

assistants) 
and 
analysts,” 

Zordich said. “… Every week 
they study the film of the 
opponent for the scout team, 
but there’s a bigger emphasis on 
it this week because it is such a 
different offense.”

The 
hardest 
challenge 

for 
Michigan, 
as 
Zordich 

discussed, will be all of the 
misdirection and deception.

In the Wolverines’ offense — 

which the defense faces every 
day in practice — there might 
a trick play here and there. But 
Michigan’s offense isn’t based 
around trick plays. Air Force is 
the opposite.

“Now,” Zordich said, “(We) 

have to be ready for it just about 
on every down.”

Drevno emphasizing correctable details ahead of Air Force contest

Tim Drevno gets a rush out 

of the light-bulb moments.

Luckily for him, with this 

inexperienced 
Wolverine 

squad, 
there’s 
plenty 
of 

opportunity for those.

“They’re 
young, 
which 

is great, and they’re very 
talented,” Drevno said. “But 
every day is a new day. It 
doesn’t matter if you’re a 
fifth-year guy, a fourth-year 
guy or a first-year guy. You’ve 
got to teach it to them like 
they’ve never heard it before 
and 
be 
dynamic 
the 
way 

you’re teaching it so they do 
understand it.

“And then have them ask 

questions back to you and then 
you ask them questions to make 
sure they fully understand. 
That excites me, as a coach, 
is being able to teach and 
then 
getting 
it 
and 
then 

understanding it, executing it.”

That dialogue may be more 

rampant 
than 
ever 
right 

now. 
Wednesday 
afternoon, 

when 
Michigan’s 
offensive 

coordinator 
addressed 
the 

media, 
he 
was 
quick 
to 

emphasize that 
practice 
has 

been 
focused 

on 
the 
easily 

correctable 
details 
that 

plagued 
the 

Wolverines 
against 
Cincinnati.

The 
two 

fumbles against 
the 
Bearcats 

may be the most 
obvious of those 
details, but the issues stretch 
beyond that.

“The fly sweeps, the motions, 

not fumbling the ball, not 
giving up a sack — I mean those 
are all correctable things,” 

Drevno said. “... Just being 
really 
detailed 
orientated. 

Those are the things we’re 
really focused on and we focus 
on them every week. When it 
happens in a game, it magnifies 
like everything magnifies, and 

you 
put 
your 

eyes on it like, 
‘Hey, how can 
we do it better 
as 
coaches 
so 

they understand 
it?’ ”

Drevno 

emphasized that 
players have to 
be comfortable 
with 
making 

adjustments, 
adding 
that 

he is doing his 

part by “crossing every T and 
dotting every I” to ensure the 
game plan is sound. 

One 
adjustment 
came 

against Cincinnati when two 
defensive 
linemen 
twisted 

on Nolan Ulizio and Michael 
Onwenu twice. Both times, 
Michigan’s 
inexperienced 

offensive 
line 
duo 
were 

beat, 
and 
redshirt 
junior 

quarterback Wilton Speight 
faced pressure.

The 
third 

time, 
though, 

the 
Bearcats 

weren’t 
so 

successful. 
Ulizio 
and 

Onwenu 
each 

picked up on 
it, and Speight 
had the pocket 
to himself. Call 
it a light-bulb 
moment.

“That’s 

exciting,” Drevno said of the 
in-game adjustment. “When a 
guy fixes a problem that you’ve 
talked to him about — they fix 
it and they do it — and it’s like 
‘Hey, right on, we’re getting 

one step closer to (being) 
really good.’ ”

Onwenu 
and 
Ulizio’s 

correction 
was 
only 
one 

example of a larger trend that 
Drevno 
has 
followed 
with 

this 
developing 

group. As he put 
it, 
Michigan’s 

offense 
is 

one 
with 

every 
player’s 

fingerprints 
on 

it.

According 
to 

Drevno, a process 
such 
as 
that 

happens 
almost 

universally — in 
practice, 
games 

and the meeting 

rooms alike.

And while that strategy is 

already working well, there is 
a certain sense of urgency to 
correcting the mistakes. After 
all, Air Force is the only team 

standing between Michigan 
and its Big Ten opener.

The 
Falcons 
aren’t 
a 

cakewalk, either. As Drevno 
explained, 
Michigan 

will face a fast and well-
disciplined defense with an 
unconventional scheme that 
isn’t afraid to blitz. They are 
technically sound — capable of 
making the tackles they need 
to and reading routes in the 
secondary.

Against that defense, Drevno 

could use a few more light-bulb 
moments.

“A mistake happens — bam, 

you put it down and it’s done,” 
Drevno said. “You don’t want 
to ever see it again. Is it gonna 
happen again? It might. You 
don’t want (it) to, but at least 
you’ve addressed it, you’ve 
coached it and they understand 
the 
adjustments 
off 
that 

mistake and what needs to 
happen.”

Michigan’s offensive coordinator has pushed his developing linemen toward a steady pattern of growth over time

Notable Quotable

“I thought he had 

some spectacular plays. 

Avoiding the tackle for a 

loss, free runner on the 

edge, that was significant. 

His long run on the 

sweep on a corner who 

was unblocked, thought 

that was outstanding. He 

had one called back due 

to a penalty and missed 

assignment. He had two or 

three opportunities called 

back or taken away because 

of execution. So, he’s taking 

his opportunity this year. 

It’s very important for 

him.”

‘M’ impresses in draw at No. 1 Indiana

Robbie Mertz lept, whipped 

his head toward the ball, and 
scored one of the biggest goals 
the Michigan men’s soccer 
team has had this decade. 

The Wolverines went to 

Bloomington and played No. 
1 Indiana to a 1-1 stalemate 
on Wednesday night. After a 
4-0-1 start to the season – its 
best since 2008 – this game 
was No. 18 Michigan’s chance 
to prove itself a contender. 
Consider it done.

Mertz’s 
goal 
came 
50 

minutes 
into 
the 
game. 

Freshman midfielder Umar 
Farouk Osman set it up with 
a run down the right wing 
and a well-placed cross. Trey 
Muse, 
Indiana’s 
freshman 

goalkeeper, had a chance to 
punch it out. Mertz got there 
first.

The Hoosiers scored the 

game’s opening goal just 11 
minutes into play. A Wolverine 
turnover in their own half 
gave Indiana a 3-on-2 chance. 
For a fleeting second it looked 
like 
sophomore 
goalkeeper 

Andrew 
Verdi 
might 
play 

the hero, as he saved two 
consecutive shots from two 
different 
Hoosier 
players. 

On the third – from junior 
defender Andrew Gutman – 
 

Verdi was helpless.

For the rest of the first half, 

Indiana put on a defensive 
clinic.

Michigan didn’t record its 

first shot on goal until the 
40th minute. Osman found 
himself on the right side of 
the box with space – a rarity 
against 
a 
team 
with 
the 

Hoosiers’ defensive caliber – 
but his shot was easily stopped 
by Muse. When the whistle 
blew signaling the end of the 
first half, it looked like an 
impending beatdown.

“I think we were fortunate 

to only concede one (in the 
first half),” said Michigan 
head coach Chaka Daley after 
the game. “You could tell by 
the shots and stats that (in) 

the first 15 minutes, they kind 
of had us on the ropes.”

After halftime, everything 

changed.

“We just asked them to 

step up slightly and focus 
more on some minor details 
defensively,” Daley said. “And 
it 
certainly 

proved 
fruitful.”

Indiana 

freshman 
forward Griffin 
Dorsey forced a 
diving save out 
of Verdi in the 
58th 
minute. 

His 
shot 
was 

directed at the 
far 
post, 
but 

not far enough. That ended 
up being the best chance the 
Hoosiers had for the rest of 
regulation. 

The closest the Wolverines 

came to taking a lead was 
in the 73rd minute. After 
Muse saved senior midfielder 
Tristan 
Jacob’s 
shot, 
the 

ensuing rebound looked like 
a goal-in-waiting. Michigan 
had a numbers advantage in 
Indiana’s box, but couldn’t 
take the upper hand. 

“I think guys were trying 

to find out who could get to 
it first and who could get a 

toe 
poke 
to 

it,” Daley said. 
“I think guys 
were 
kind 
of 

in the way and 
someone 
just 

needed to kind 
of knock it or 
toe poke it.”

Pouring 

rain 
over 

Bloomington 
went 
on 
as 

long as the game. In college 
soccer, a tie game goes to 
two 
10-minute 
overtimes 

before it gets called. For the 
Wolverines, those 20 minutes 
were as stressful as you might 
expect.

The 
first 
overtime 
was 

largely 
devoid 
of 
scoring 

chances for both teams. Verdi’s 
only save came off a Hoosier 
free kick, and that didn’t 
come until the 99th minute. 
Redshirt 
junior 
defender 

Timmy Mehl’s header was on 
goal, but Verdi swallowed it up 
easily.

Indiana was able to lay 

claim to the best chance of 
the second overtime as well. 
In the 107th minute, a cross 
found its way into Michigan’s 
box and looked dangerous, 
but redshirt junior midfielder 
Cory Thomas couldn’t put it 
away.

When 
the 
game 
finally 

ended, the Wolverines came 
away with perhaps their most 
important result in years. But 
Daley isn’t celebrating just yet.

“Two 
games 
in, 
people 

are going to put rankings 
on people. They’re number 
one, we’re eighteen – it’s not 
relevant,” Daley said. “We 
just continue to keep our 
head up and keep things in 
perspective.”

CREATIVE CAPABILITIES AT SCALE

A public lecture and reception.

The phrase “hole in the wall” 

is thrown around a lot, but the 
Ann Arbor Comedy Showcase 
might have the best claim to 
the ubiquitous descriptor. It’s a 
hole in scaffolding.

That’s 
because 
the 

Showcase’s home — a short, 
anonymous building on Fourth 
Avenue 
between 
Liberty 

and Washington — is under 
renovation, and all signs of 
the Showcase’s very existence 
are reserved to the covered 
sidewalk that runs next to the 
construction: a folded sign on 
the street, large blue letters 
on the door and the brief sight 
of an attended ticket office 
through the glass.

But once inside the doors, 

and down the hallway and down 
the stairs and across from the 
bar, the Comedy Showcase is 
inviting. Excited 20-somethings 
are mingling, drink orders are 
being taken; there’s a giddy air 
of anticipation before a show.

At the center of the Comedy 

Showcase’s 
operations 
sits 

the soft-spoken yet deliberate 
Roger 
Feeny 
(“I 
honestly 

don’t like to do interviews”), a 
smallish man with graying wiry 
hair and focused eyes behind 
large, 
tortoiseshell 
glasses. 

One would hardly think of the 
60-something Feeny, who was 
dressed in a hoodie and polo and 
quietly sipping tea as we spoke, 

as the sort of entertainment 
genius who could keep a club 
afloat for 33 years in one of 
Michigan’s most competitive 
real estate markets. And yet 
there we were.

Feeny 
founded 
the 
club 

in 1984 when he was 29. He 
had been a dockworker and 
teamster for 10 years, hardly a 
recognizable career path from 
this vantage point. His brother-

in-law, Kirkland Teeple, had 
established himself as a stand-
up comic on the road before 

coming to Ann Arbor with the 
hopes of starting a comedy 
club. Starting up a club in a 
big town from scratch requires 
more than just a sense of humor 
(though that certainly helps), 
but Teeple and Feeny created 
a perfect match: Teeple knew 
the comics, and Feeny had a 
business sense, and so the pair 
opened up a comedy club above 
the Heidelberg Restaurant on 
Main Street in Ann Arbor.

The 
Mainstreet 
Comedy 

Showcase 
remained 
on 
its 

titular street for a few years 
before moving in 1987 to the 
VFW Hall on Liberty Street, 
where Jerusalem Garden sits 
now. The Showcase relocated to 
its current location on Fourth 
Avenue in 2014. In between, 
the club has sponsored softball 
teams in town, hosted benefits 
for the community and put on 
golf outings for the staff.

Ann Arbor, it turned out, is a 

great location for the club.

“The 
school 
and 
the 

curriculum spits out doctors 
and lawyers and Ann Arbor’s 
a smart town,” Feeny said. “So 
we’ve got smart people that 
come here.”

That 
intelligence 
puts 

pressure on comedians; here, 
even slapstick comedy, which 
is based in embarrassment and 
errors, can make you think.

While the club has moved a 

number of times, the structure 
of its shows has remained 
consistent. At a typical stand-
up show, an emcee, and perhaps 
another comedian, will play 
the role of warm-up act, 
each telling jokes for about 
five minutes. The opener is 
followed by the featured act, 
a more established comedian, 
who entertains the crowd 
for about 15 minutes. The 
headliner, with a set of about 
50 minutes, closes out the 
show.

Feeny acknowledges that 

there’s a business strategy to 
the timing — 90 minutes, he 
notes, is the typical length of a 
film before an audience starts 
to shift in its seats — but when 
the shows are good, it’s a win-
win situation.

“It’s 
taken 
from 
the 

restaurant philosophy: Feed 
‘em, don’t stuff ‘em, so they’ll 
want to come back for more,” 
he said.

Saturday nights are the 

most 
popular 
shows, 
and 

winter is the busy season. His 
key to success is bringing in 
a wide variety of comics and 
comedic styles: slapstick and 
storytellers, men and women, 
catering to old and young.

Over 
time, 
Feeny 
has 

incidentally become a sort 
of comedy guru, continually 
providing a forum for young, 
budding comics to perform at 
open mics. “We like to develop 
talent,” Feeny said. “I’ve been 
known to give guys their first 
headline gig and bring in guys 
you don’t really hear of, but 

they’re very funny.”

The Showcase hosts weekly 

open mics, which can help 
young 
comics 
try 
out 
the 

medium. “You can come and 
work on your material,” said 
Erich Laux, a recent University 
of 
Michigan 
graduate 
and 

budding stand-up who often 
performs at the Showcase. “And 
through that he’s in the local 
scene because he sees all the 

younger and newer comics 
come through. So he can see 
when somebody is ready to 
start hosting.”
Feeny’s quick to give out 

advice to young comics, too.

“You have to keep writing,” 

he said. “That’s what I keep 
telling 
them: 
Keep 
writing 

clean material. That’s the only 
way you’re going to learn how 
to write jokes.”

Undoubtedly 
a 
result 
of 

Feeny’s efforts at creating a 
supportive 
training 
ground 

for rising comedians, the Ann 
Arbor Comedy Showcase has 
become a go-to destination 
for comics looking to find 
friendly 
audiences. 
While 

most 
performers 
are 
from 

southeastern Michigan, “guys 
come to the open mic night 
from over 100 miles away,” 
Feeny said. “They’ll drive in to 
do five minutes on stage.”

One hundred miles is no easy 

drive for anyone, let alone a 
young comics who may be just 
feeling out the industry and 
looking for available open mic 
nights, but their willingness 
to drive all the way for five 
minutes 
in 
an 
Ann 
Arbor 

basement is indicative of the 
support system Feeny provides.

“If you’ve got a good stage to 

perform on, they’ll come a long 

way,” he added.

Laux, the budding comic, 

started performing stand-up 
through a student organization 
at the University called LOL 
ROFL — “It was started when 
that was still relevant,” he said 
— and would go to the Showcase 
to see comics and perform at 
the open mic nights.

Now, he spends time in a 

community of rising stand-
ups who stay at the Showcase 
to watch and learn from the 
performers. They carpool to 
different shows around the 
state and share notes and horror 
stories with one another.

Laux readily acknowledges 

the help that Feeny and the 
Showcase provide. “Roger is 
the owner and he runs (the 
Showcase),” Laux said, “so he 
has say in all the shows and 
everyone he books.” Feeny’s 
style is in sharp contrast to 
more 
corporate-run 
comedy 

clubs elsewhere. Those clubs 
lack the sort of personal touch 
and quality that has become 
the hallmark of the Showcase, 
where 
comedians 
have 
to 

impress Feeny in order to move 
up to performing at shows other 
than open mics.

Laux was the emcee this past 

Saturday at 8 p.m., and he was 
followed by Nicole Majdali, a 
Livonia-based comedian with 
a 
more 
confessional 
style. 

Chris Daniels, originally from 
Michigan 
and 
now 
living 

in New York, served as the 
featured comic.

The headliner featured the 

show’s 
biggest 
name: 
Dave 

Landau, 
a 
comedian 
from 

Detroit who was featured on 
NBC’s “Last Comic Standing.” 
Before he was a touring stand-
up comic, Landau was based at 
Second City in Chicago, when 
a friend there suggested he 

should try his hand at a solo act. 
He made his way to Ann Arbor, 
where he started at the open 
mics.

“The open mic really gave you 

training wheels that nowhere 
else could because the audience 
was always more diverse and a 

little more heady,” said Landau 
in a roundtable of comics, 
including Majdali, Daniels and 
Nate Armbruster, who also 
performs regularly at the club, 
in the green room after the 8:00 
show. “They expected more out 
of the comic and I loved that 
about it.”

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Comedy 

Showcase was the first place 
both Daniels and Armbruster 

had 
performed 
comedy. 

Armbruster was in high school 
in Dearborn when he first 
came to a class offered at the 
club. Soon after, he began to 
perform at open mics. He was 
so young that Roger had to call 
his mother to make sure she 
approved of him performing 
stand-up. That was nine years 
ago. Now, bearded and leaning 
back on the green room couch, 
he’s a regular.

Daniels 
was 
17 
when, 

unbeknownst 
to 
him, 
his 

friends signed him up for an 
open mic at the venue after 
he had boasted of his comedic 
talents. Suddenly, Daniels was 
thrust into a five-minute set — 
a rarity in his current milieu 
— which he remembers going 
well, joking about partying with 
friends and Britney Spears’s 
attempted comeback.

“I had easy targets at the 

time,” he said.

Majdali is the newest to the 

club in the room. She caught 
wind of the open mic and 
continued to return.

“I did not come to Ann Arbor 

until I got hooked on coming 
here,” Majdali said, enamored 
with the support system at 
the club, including the comics 
sitting in the back and the 
bartenders that serve and laugh 
along with the audience. “Now I 
go to Ann Arbor a couple times 
a week.”

Even the space itself is crafted 

for 
optimal 
performances. 

Behind the comedian looms a 
white backdrop with the club 
logo, cropped by glass blocks 
lit an electric blue. The stage 
is rather small, the ceilings 
are low and the first row of the 
audience is huddled around 
the stage. The result is a 
large-capacity space that feels 
intimate, even from the back 

row.

“A room with 20 people can 

feel like a 100,” Armbruster 
said.

“It encourages participation,” 

Daniels added.

“It feels like a nightclub in the 

basement of a place,” Landau 
said, which he explained makes 
the Showcase something of an 
oasis in the Midwest, where 
that ambience is more of a 
rarity.

But even in such a tight space, 

no comedian is guaranteed 
success. Bombing in Ann Arbor 
is something all the comedians 
have 
experienced, 
and 
it 

especially stings.

“It’s a great place to grow as 

a comic because you get good 
audiences,” Landau said. “They 
kind of expect more from you 
and when you bomb here you 
really fucking bomb.”

Daniels attributes the low 

lows to the spirit of the crowd.

“They just seem to enjoy it a 

lot more than in a lot of other 
places,” he said. “They just kind 
of create an atmosphere, and 
that helps, so that’s why for me 
doing bad here feels like you 
kamikaze’d yourself. You had a 
win and you blew it.”

But even when the comedian 

is down, Feeny is there to help. 
As long as the comedian in 
question is trying new material 
and working hard, “they’re 
not judging you and kicking 
you out and saying don’t come 
back,” Landau said. Instead, the 
comedian is encouraged to try 
again.

Armbruster 
recalls 
that 

occasionally, 
if 
he 
tries 

something 
that 
falls 
flat 

before an audience, he’ll hear 
Feeny cackling quietly in the 

background — it’s “one of the 
worst and best feelings,” he 
said. “You just know that he’s 
enjoying it because he knows 
exactly what’s going through 
your head.”

The 
others 
nodded 
in 

agreement. 
Landau 
added 

that when a comedian totally 
offends the crowd, “you’ll also 
hear that laugh sometimes and 
it’s so encouraging, because you 
think, ‘Oh, the guy who really 
gets comedy got it so I don’t 
care what anyone else thinks.’”

That’s in sharp contrast to 

other clubs in the area where 
the owners are often divorced 
from the comedians, to say 
nothing of the corporate-run 
clubs to which Laux contrasted 
the Showcase. At some of those 
other clubs, “somebody could 
walk here and punch me in the 
face and nobody would have my 
back,” Armbruster said.

But it’s different at the 

Showcase — Feeny provides 
a wealth of resources to his 
comedians.

“He has a speech at every 

open mic: ‘Don’t go over the 
time,’” 
Majdali 
said. 
“He’s 

trying to teach you to be a 
professional and a good comic, 
and sometimes people don’t get 
that. And it’s very important. 
They’re teaching you business 
skills.”

And even better for comics: 

“They just understand comedy,” 
Armbruster added.

“Don’t take it for granted,” 

warned Daniels, the Michigan 
transplant in New York. “If you 
leave here and hit the road or 
if you move to a bigger comedy 
scene, they’re not as forgiving 
and you won’t be able to hone 
your skills in the same way.”

“But every time I come here,” 

Daniels said, “I’m like, ‘This 
feels good. It feels like home.’”

Joke’s on you: A look at 
three U-M comedy groups

Every Three Weekly, Comco, Midnight Book Club — three 
groups that have staked claims in comedy on the U-M campus

The origins of the Every 

Three Weekly, the University of 
Michigan’s satirical publication, 
aren’t exactly sexy. “I think a 
group of people who were not 
very good with girls started this 
thing: That’s how it came to be,” 
explained Business and LSA 
senior Suzy Weiss, co-editor of 
the Every Three Weekly. Its eye-
catching slogan — “Better than 
sex, twice as often” — and biting 
headlines attract thousands of 
readers, from curious freshmen 
to seasoned seniors.

Founded in 1997 and funded by 

the University Activities Center, 
the paper has been triweekly — 
the name is a clever spoof of The 
Michigan Daily — since 1999. Its 
creative influence is undeniably 
The Onion, but its ultimate 
source of inspiration comes from 
AP style news headlines rather 
than satire.

“Real 
newspapers 
are 

probably of a more inspiration 
than comedy websites because 
the big thing that dictates the 
Every Three Weekly is form,” 
Weiss said. “So, we’re really 
married to AP style in a print 
paper.”

Its headlines take a mundane, 

often inconsequential campus 
event or phenomenon and bend 
it to reveal unseen hilarity. For 
example, “President Schlissel 
sends 
email 
urging 
student 

body to ‘check out all the sweet 
dinosaurs’ 
at 

Natural History 
Museum.” 
The 
Ever 

Three 
Weekly 

also 
includes 

sections beyond 
campus 
life, 

such as opinion, 
national, world 
and sports news 
satire.

There 
is 
a 

systematic 
approach 
to 

the 
Every 

Three Weekly’s 
publishing 
process.

“You try and 

find a trope that 
most 
people 

can 
relate 

to. 
It 
could 

be anything from not eating 
vegetables to a girl ignoring 
you, and you didn’t want to be 
her boyfriend anyway — things 
that are sort of in the zeitgeist 
of campus,” Weiss said. “Then 
we come up with eight to 10 
headlines that we pitch to the 
room before each cycle begins, 
and based on the amount of 
laughs it gets is what gets 
written.”

The Every Three Weekly 

avoids 
writing 
about 

hypothetical 
situations 
that 

would be funny if they happened 

— or as it calls them, WIBFIs 
(wouldn’t it be funny if…).

“When something is overly 

goofy or funny, like, ‘Schlissel 
elbows freshman in the face 
to get first in line Meatless 
Mondays’ … that’s a WIBFI, 
which is something we shy away 
from,” Weiss explained.

Though eager to poke fun at 

almost everything, the paper has 
a moral code that dictates what 
gets published.

“I think a guiding principle 

of the Every Three Weekly is 
that we’re always siding with 
the victim,” Weiss said. “We 
never want to kick someone 
while they’re down.” It avoids 
topics that could never be funny, 
regardless of the direction it 
takes.

Still, the Every Three Weekly 

isn’t afraid to raise eyebrows. 
Weiss made it clear that there 
are “some things we think it’s 
our duty to lampoon, things that 
people are being overly sensitive 
about or having a reaction that’s 
a little too self-serious.” She is 
well aware that the paper’s style 
may not be for the faint of heart: 
“You 
can’t 
please 
everyone, 

and we certainly don’t want to. 
We want to offend to a tasteful 
level.”

As 
expected, 
its 
content 

occasionally stirs up controversy. 
In 2010, Briarwood Mall wrote a 
cease-and-desist to the paper for 
defamation after an article titled 
“Mall Santa tells child exactly 
what he wants for Christmas” 
explicitly mentioned the mall’s 

name. 
Weiss 

explained 
that 

today 
they’re 

able 
to 
laugh 

about 
the 

incident.

“We have this 

really 
serious 

letter that was 
written by their 
lawyer … and 
I just love the 
idea 
of 
him 

having to write 
that cease-and-
desist letter.”

In 
such 
a 

contentious 
political 
climate, 
Weiss 

explained: “It’s 
as 
important 

as ever to stay 
grounded 
in 

our moral compass and not to 
let that get shifted by the tides 
of 
so-called 
progressivism, 

so-called conservatism. I think 
if the joke’s funny, it’ll run, and 
that is our guiding principle.”

The Every Three Weekly is an 

entirely anonymous publication, 
though a list of its staff can be 
found on each issue. Weiss noted 
that compared to other comedy 
groups on campus, particularly 
improv groups, there is a crucial 
difference: 
“They’re 
about 

immediate gratification; we’re 
about never being gratified. 

It’s an anonymous paper, no 
one knows our name.” Most 
students have had a class with an 
Every Three Weekly writer and 
probably never knew it.

“It’s a lot of kids who would 

giggle 
to 
themselves 
about 

something 
and 
think 
that 

everyone else would enjoy it, not 
people who are screaming out to 
get the big laugh,” she said.

“There are very funny people 

on the paper, but I think a 
misconception is, actually, that 
if you join the E3W, you’re going 
to get … good-looking, very 
funny group,” and Weiss assured 
me that this is, indeed, not the 
case. “We’re not like an improv 
group. We have none of the 
good personality and barely any 
charisma. When you’re around 
ComCo and Midnight Book Club, 
two groups that I really love … 
they’re charmers.”

For what it may lack in charm, 

the Every Three Weekly makes 
up for in wit, 
possessing 
a 

creative 
lens 

that can make 
any trivial event 
hilarious.

ComCo, short 

for 
Comedy 

Company, 
was 

founded 
in 

the 
late 
’70s, 

making it the 
oldest 
improv 

troupe 
on 

campus. 
Jon 

Glaser, famous 
for his role as 
Councilman 
Jeremy 
Jamm 

on “Parks and 
Recreation,” is 
among 
many 

of the successful alumni who 
performed in ComCo during 
college.

Structurally, 
ComCo 

specializes in short form, a style 
distinguished by short scenes 
dictated by a theme randomly 
assigned by the audience. Since 
improv 
is 
entirely 
on-the-

spot and does not follow a 
predetermined 
script, 
the 

rehearsal process focuses on 
building skills. LSA junior Ellis 
Hyman, an improv veteran, 
wisely compared this to the way 
a sports team practices before a 
game.

“Think of (improv rehearsals 

as) analogous to a sports team. 
As a sports team, you do similar 
things you would do in a real 
game,” Hyman said. “You do 
practices, exercises, even real 
scrimmages of the full game. But 
then, what you do in practice is 
100 percent different than what 
happens on the field.”

Past improv experience is not 

necessary for ComCo. “One of 
our former alumni, Guy, who 
graduated last winter, joined 
ComCo as a sophomore, literally 
never had done improv in his 
entire life before, and now he’s 
pursuing it professionally in 

Chicago. So, we have people 
with no experience at all — never 
even been on a stage before — 
to people like myself who have 
done improv,” Hyman said.

Anyone can, and does, join 

Comco.

“It’s really varied. People 

from every major, every walk of 
life: just a random amalgamation 
of 
random 
people,” 
Hyman 

explained.

And this enhances the quality 

of their performances.

“You don’t want to have 

people of the exact same senses 
of humor because it’s going to be 
a one-man show almost,” Hyman 
said. “We’re of course looking 
for people who we like and 
enjoy, but also have a little bit 
of diversity in styles of improv, 
comedy and personalities.”

Differences in comedic style 

complement one another, making 
for a well-rounded scene.

“For me personally, I find the 

easiest humor to do is really 
energetic, movement improv,” 
Hyman said. “But someone who 
would be a little more reserved, 
maybe have more of a cynical 
sense of humor, would really 
balance well to that. I think 
we all pull different aspects 
of 
comedians 
that 
we 
like 

because there’s not one style of 
improviser in ComCo, so I feel 
like we all get inspirations from 
different styles of comedy. And 
honestly, life is so beautiful: You 
can find comedy in anything and 
everything.”

ComCo, like other short-form 

troupes, 
plays 

games with its 
audience during 
performances. 
During 
rehearsals, 
it 
practices 

these 
games 

to 
improve 

its 
quick-

wittedness and 
wordplay.

“We practice 

a 
game, 
it’ll 

be 
totally 

different in a 
performance 
than in practice, 
but it’ll be the 
same structure 
as what we do,” 
Hyman added.

Though ComCo’s improvisers 

are also hilarious off stage, it’s 
not all about being the funniest 
person on stage.

“Improv 
isn’t 
necessarily 

about being funny. It’s about 
scene work, being a good team 
player … and being able to think 
on your feet,” Hyman said. “If 
I went on stage and started 
cracking 
jokes 
and 
wasn’t 

thinking about anyone else, it 
would be the worst scene ever.”

The first ComCo show is 

free, and the troupe assuredly 
will continue its 38-year-long 
tradition of bringing quality 
improv to students in this year’s 
performances.

Midnight Book Club, another 

improv troupe at the University, 
has become one of the most 
influential and popular troupes 
on campus. MBC’s president, 
Kevin Corbett, a Music, Theatre 
& 
Dance 
and 
LSA 
senior, 

explained the troupe’s origins: 
“A group of similarly-minded 
individuals that loved comedy 
decided 
to 
create 
a 
group, 

and since then, they started 
performing in rooms in the 
Michigan League.” MBC hasn’t 
been around as long as ComCo, 
and was founded within the 

decade.

“The first (audition), they had 

five to 10 people come on for 
the troupe. Now, we’re having 
around 100 people audition and 
having big crowds come to our 
shows in Angell Hall,” he said.

Corbett agreed with Hyman 

about the different experience 
levels, which make “college 
improv so rich … you have these 
varying levels of experience. 
It’s a culmination of ideas and 
talents, and I think it shows in 
the results.”

MBC’s sole focus is long-form 

improv, with sketches often 
spanning more than 30 minutes. 
“If you have one idea going into 
a scene, it can easily change; it’s 
very 
malleable 

because 
it’s 
a 

longer 
set 
of 

time that you’re 
working 
with,” 

Corbett said.

Corbett 

described 
an 

abstract concept 
called 
group 

mind: “It’s the 
ultimate form of 
consciousness 
that you want 
to have as an 
improviser, 
where you know 
exactly what an 
improviser 
is 

thinking. 
And, 

you kind of get 
the 
general 

sense of where a 
scene is going to go.”

For long form, considering 

the sketch can take unexpected 
turns, 
this 
is 
especially 

important.

“I think that because we’re 

such good friends and because 
we have a really great sense of 
camaraderie, our group mind is 

heightened,” he said.

MBC competes against other 

colleges, and wherever it goes, 
it’s constantly performing both 
on and off stage.

“We do love our bits and 

we do love performing both in 
rehearsal and out of rehearsal 
— performing in the sense of 
making 
each 
other 
laugh,” 

Corbett said. “That’s what I love 
about MBC, is everyone just 
loves making each other laugh, 
whether it’s in rehearsal, on 
stage or getting dinner.”

It’s that environment which 

makes MBC so great.

“It’s students that fucking 

love each other and fucking love 
comedy,” Corbett said. “Going 

into 
rehearsal 

is … my favorite 
part 
of 
every 

week. 
It’s 
so 

much fun even 
if you’re having 
a shitty day … 
you’re able to 
improvise with 
(your 
friends), 

make 
these 

hilarious 
jokes 

and 
just 
feel 

good.”

MBC 
is 

funded through 
grants 
and 

donations, 
and its shows 
are 
free 
of 

charge. Though 
consistently 
well-received by 

audiences, the troupe prioritizes 
its own enjoyment.

“We always say in MBC, let’s 

play for us,” Corbett said. “Let’s 
improvise for us. At the end of 
the day, we’re happiest when 
we’re making each other laugh; 
I think that’s what makes our 
group pretty special.”

Comedy icon Dave Chappelle
Seeing Dave Chappelle: 

Hip-hop’s favorite 

comedian hits the road

Dave Chappelle — the bold-

faced funny man who emerged 
in 
the 
early-2000s 
as 
an 

Afrocentric satirist, unafraid 
to 
squeeze 
risqué 
racial 

commentary 
into 
his 
now-

legendary sketch comedy show 
— has long been an important 
figure in hip-hop. The first 
season of Chappelle’s Show 
(which briefly aired on Comedy 
Central) 
featured 
musical 

guests such as Mos Def, Talib 
Kweli, Busta Rhymes and The 
Roots, while its second included 
DMX, Erykah Badu and Kanye 
West (to name a few). Yet, unlike 
so many artists who haunt the 
primetime late-night sets of 
Jimmys (Fallon and Kimmel) — 
often seeming so out-of-context 
during 
their 
promotional 

performances that one wonders 
if the hosts even knew who they 
had invited — artists’s arrivals 
at Chappelle’s Show felt like 
pointed 
recommendations. 

Their performances served as 
punctuation marks for each 
episode.

So, 
a 
true 
Chappelle 

fan 
should 
not 
have 
been 

overwhelmingly 
surprised 

when 
hip-hop 
legends 
Ms. 

Lauryn Hill and Nas announced 
— just days before the launching 
of their joint PowerNomics Tour 
— that the notoriously-reclusive 
comedian would be joining 
them on the road. In fact, the 
closer that one has been paying 
attention, the less surprised 
they ought to be: Since June, 
Chappelle has performed aside 
Ms. Hill, Chance the Rapper, 
Childish Gambino and more 
during a residency at Radio City 
Music Hall; he has questioned 
Kendrick Lamar for Interview 
Magazine, an already-historic 
conversation in its own right; 
and he has continuously owned 
up to his role as a musical 
gatekeeper, like when he labeled 
Lil Wayne “one of the most 
clever 
motherfuckers 
ever” 

during an appearance on Sway 
In The Morning. Much like 
modern rappers, who can earn 
enough clout through their 
craft to eventually expand into 
other ventures (think fashion, 
film and Diddy’s Ciroc vodka), 
Chappelle became so deeply 
embedded into hip-hop through 
humor that his position aside 
two historic emcees just feels 
natural.

For 
anyone 
who’s 
ever 

nostalgically 
wondered 
how 

Chappelle’s Show accomplished 
its 
near-perfect 
roster 
of 

conscious Black musicians, or 
has hoped for a similarly prolific 
blending of hip-hop and comedy 
to occur today, the PowerNomics 
Tour — which touched down 
at 
the 
Michigan 
Lottery 

Amphitheatre at Freedom Hill 
in Sterling Heights on Fri., Sept. 
8th — represents a perhaps once-
in-a-lifetime 
opportunity 
to 

travel back in time and become 
a witness to history. Both Nas 
— whose debut LP, Illmatic, 
is commonly considered the 
best rap album of all time — 
and Lauryn Hill — whose only 
solo LP, The Miseducation of 
Lauryn Hill, was the first hip-
hop project to win Album of the 
Year at the Grammy’s — are like 
walking relics from a former 
version 
of 
hip-hop, 
hardly 

recognizable against modern 
standards. 
But 
performing 

after Chappelle, who is himself 
also representative of a long-
gone era, one in which impolite 
humor 
and 
cable 
television 

ruled supreme, the pair truly 
succeeded in establishing a 
sense of then.

Throughout 
his 
forty-five 

minute set, Chappelle appeared 
in full-form, talking through 
even the touchiest of subjects 
in his classically casual tone 
and unflinching against today’s 
heightened 
expectations 

for 
correctness. 
Skewering 

the 
famous 
sexual 
assault 

allegations 
against 
Michael 

Jackson, 
he 
minimized 
the 

late, great pop star into the 
“Jay-Z” of hanging with kids, 
drawing parallels between MJ’s 
odd indulgence in children’s 
fantasies (he owned a monkey, 
an amusement park and beds 
dedicated 
exclusively 
to 

jumping on) and the veteran 
Brooklyn 
rapper’s 
similar 

obsession with luxury goods 
(references to cars, yachts and 
watches decorate his every 
album). 
Traversing 
through 

race-relations, 
Chappelle 

laughed off the time that a 
pregnant Asian women (who is 
married to a Black man) became 
so offended by his commentary 
on interracial marriages that she 
went home to write a complaint 
to his promoter. And, finally, 
sweating through a bit that he 
swore he wouldn’t have told if 
attendees’s phones had not been 
locked into inaccessible pouches 
upon their arrival, Chappelle 
cringed at memories from a 
night of clubbing in Hollywood 
during 
which 
he 
danced 

(initially unbeknownst) with a 
transsexual woman.

Clearly, Dave Chappelle was 

simply being Dave Chappelle, 
but in 2017 that’s a major 
accomplishment 
in 
its 
own 

right. Throughout the next 
month, the PowerNomics Tour 
will bring him — along with 
two equally historic and fabled 
musicians — into fifteen more 
cities, fifteen more jam-packed 
theaters filled with thousands 
of 
people, 
old 
and 
young, 

who could’ve probably never 
predicted such an opportunity 
would 
arise. 
But 
more 

importantly, it will also generate 
millions of dollars worth of 
proceeds, a major portion of 
which its team has pledged 
to 
donate 
towards 
further 

enfranchisement 
of 
African-

American communities.

This tour is not simply a parade 

of nostalgia for nostalgia’s sake, 
and it’s also not an attempt by 
old artists to collect new cash. 
Rather, it’s a strong-handed 
effort by a legendary team of 
Black entertainers to merge 
their platforms and heighten 
their impacts — both on the 
crowds they entertain and the 
communities that they will 
assist. This point was hinted at 
by a briefly serious Chappelle 
in the final moments of his set. 
Addressing Detroit, he professed 
how proud he is to be among 
residents of the largest Black 
community in American history, 
then reminded attendees that 
Motown — which was launched 
right here in our own backyard 
— is still the most quintessential 
example of a Black cultural 
enterprise, period.

“Detroit, I’m gon’ fuck with 

you until the wheels fall off!”

Just like that, it was time for 

Nas and Lauryn.

COURTESY OF THE SECOND CITY

Second City performing at their various venues
The Second City brings 
laughs, love to The Ark

The legendary improvisation group that has birthed comedians 
like Tina Fey and Amy Poeher came to Ann Arbor last weekend

I’m second row and center for 

The Second City. It’s really the 
best seat in the house, because 
sitting front row risks getting 
heckled at by the troupe. Before 
the show starts, the crowd is 
already pulsing with noise and 
laughter, eagerly awaiting the 
comedy stars of tomorrow. I 
held expectations of seeing 
something similar to “Saturday 
Night Live,” a favorite show of 
mine. Since this performance 

was actually live for me, I feel 
no remorse in saying that The 
Second City blew present-day 
SNL out of the water.

Tina Fey, Steve Carell, Bill 

Murray, 
Keegan-Michael 

Key: These are just a few of 
the hilarious stars born out 
of The Second City. Based in 
Chicago, this comedy troupe 
has produced original, satirical 
and comedic pieces for nearly 
sixty years. This past Friday, 
the national tour “The Best of 
The Second City” made a stop 
here at Ann Arbor’s The Ark, 
which was recently renovated. 
Amidst the typical musicians 
and theatrical plays, we finally 
had a notable comedy revue in 
A2, bringing diversity to the 
entertainment scene.

Improv is what makes The 

Second City legendary. The 
actors can instantly come up 

with a catchy song in relation to 
whatever an audience member 
shouts out, like a dog eating 
your 
boyfriend’s 
plant 
and 

having a fight about it (true 
story). The actors can flip 
between two separate scenes, 
from a horror porn movie with 
a boob-sucking dracula to two 
astronauts trying to contact 
Houston while it’s underwater. 
Both scenes are given to the 
actors on the spot and they 
immediately make it uniquely 
hilarious.

Not 
many 
actors 
are 

comfortable with calling an 
audience member a bastard 
or having an elderly audience 
member (deemed the baddest 
boy) spank them on stage. 
Both were achieved during 
the performance, and both 
had me laughing until my 
mouth hurt from smiling. This 
troupe of comedians are able 
to connect personally with 
the audience, making local 
references, 
shaking 
hands, 

asking questions and being real. 
It’s this connection that lights 
the audience on fire, creating 
moments of high energy and 
fun that you wish would never 
end.

With three girls and three 

guys, the faces of comedy’s 
new generation are memorable. 
Each has such likable charisma, 
the kind I want to see more of 
in the film industry. Alison 
Gates, Adam Archer, Danny 
Catlow, Eve Krueger, Greg 
Ott, and Lauren Walker are all 
experienced comedians; many 
participate in iO Chicago and 
The Annoyance. The director, 
Tyler Samples, teaches and 
performs at The Second City 
and hosts the Rabbit Hole 
podcast with other Second City 
guests.

“The Best of The Second 

City” features classic skits that 
helped launch the careers of 
comedy’s best and brightest, 
along with skits distinct to 
this tour. The style of the 

show was very similar to that 
of 
“Saturday 
Night 
Live”; 

both 
have 
an 
arrangement 

of different comedy sketches 
that usually reflect on current 
political, social and economic 
happenings 
in 
America. 

Many of the actors currently 
performing with SNL made 
their start with The Second 
City.

I not sure how anyone else 

feels, but to me, SNL has been 
lacking in delivery in recent 
years, 
dwindling 
down 
to 

repetitive skits and jokes that 

just aren’t that funny. After 
seeing The Second City, I have 
hope again for a better comedic 
future. A hope of SNL returning 
to the hype of Will Ferrell, 
Eddie Murphy, Amy Poehler 
and Chris Farley. I think we all 
miss those days. 

With classes not quite in 

full swing, now is the time to 
explore all the amazing venues 
that Ann Arbor. While comedy 
may not be as common as other 
shows, nothing will bring you 
into good spirits better than 
laughter. 
People 
love 
The 

Second City not just for its 
humor, but for its creativity. 
It’s different every time, and 
it’s different from the comedy 
you see on TV. You may have to 
reach into the deep corners of 
A2 to find comedy, but I assure 
you, the search is worth it.

On this particular Friday, 

little Gilda has plopped herself 
on a pink shag rug; stuffed toys 
and dollhouses at her fingertips. 
She is playing with her Looking 
For Mr. Goodbar Sleepytime 
Playset, and an impish grin of 
delight crosses her face as she 
dances her Diane Keaton doll 
around an imaginary singles 
bar with a plastic businessman.

But little Gilda misses the 

point of this game. Rather than 
have her dollies boogie the 
night away, Gilda is told that 
the object is for Dian Keaton to 
pick up as many strange men as 
possible before being killed.

So 
after 
a 
few 
Tequila 

Sunrises, Gilda guides Diane 
Keaton 
and 
the 
plastic 

businessman to Diane’s singles 
apartment. There, pony-tailed 
Gilda has a real neato night in 
store for her friends. They’ll 
make cookies and toast and 
have lots and lots of fun.

Little 
Gilda, 
however, 
is 

informed 
that 
the 
night’s 

agenda is much too mild to 
merit Judith Rossner’s raunchy 
novel. So with a momentary 
glimmer in her eye, Gilda picks 
up her plastic businessman and 
wrecks havoc on the defenseless 
body of Diane Keaton.

“I’m big and I’m strong and 

I’m gonna kiss you all over 
with my big fat slimy slips.” 
Then, with an angelic look, she 
inquires, “Did I win yet?”

No, Gilda is told, you did not 

win. You don’t win ‘til Diane 
Keaton loses.

“Now take Diane back to the 

singles bar and pick up your 
psychotic blonde homosexual.”

Gilda obliges and grasps her 

psychotic blonde homosexual. 
But once again, a confused look 
clouds her face and, ever so 
innocently, she asks: “What’s a 
psychotic blonde homosexual?”

This is a rehearsal on the 

set of NBC’s “Saturday Night 
Live,” and little Gilda is Gilda 
Radner 
— 
a 
once 
obscure 

weathergirl for Ann Arbor’s 
WCBN who is now a somewhat 
obscure TV crack-up. Unless 
you watch “Saturday Night 
Live,” you probably haven’t the 
foggiest idea who Gilda Radner 
is. If that’s the case, then 
you’ve probably never heard of 
Emily Letella, Rhonda Weiss, 
Roseanne Rosannadana, Lisa 
Leubner and Baba Wawa. Gilda 
Radner is all those people.

But, more than anything else, 

Gilda Radner is your little sister, 
or the nerdy girl down the aisle 
in Hebrew School or the funny 
kid with the big mouth.

She’s 
well 
past 
her 

adolescence but, like a child 

waiting impatiently for her 
next birthday, she measures her 
age in fractions — “thirty-one-
and-a-half.”

“I 
never 
grew 
up,” 
she 

explains.

If that’s true, then you can 

reckon Gilda Radner is the first 
person to ever make her career 
by not growing up.

***

It’s a madhouse this Friday 

on the eighth floor of New 
York’s towering NBC Building. 
Performers 
and 
stagehands 

and producers are running 
around with props and scripts 
and directions in preparation 
for the next day’s show. Inside 
the studio, its stage and sets 
bathed in light, workmen are 
hammering away at makeshift 
wooden scenery and performers 
are practicing their skits with 
help from big white cue cards.

Somewhere 
in 
the 
his 

mélange is Gilda Radner, and 
a lot of people want to know 
where she is. A small, frail-
looking woman with a smooth, 
porcelain 
complexion 
and 

brown hair tied back in a pony 
tail, she looks more like a 
Campfire Girl than a member 
of the Not Ready for Prime 
Time Players, the troupe of 
young comics without whom 
there’d be no “Saturday Night 
Live.” She has just returned 
from London, where she taped 
a guest spot on the “Muppets 
Show,” and she looks worn and 
jet-lagged. Be brief, we’re told, 
and concise. Gilda’s busy and 
tired.

Inside the small, Spartan 

dressing room that she shares 
with 
fellow 
Prime 
Timers 

Jane 
Curtin 
and 
Laraine 

Newman, Radner curls up on 
a sofa and reaches for a tray 
of cheese and crackers. She 
lights up a Virginia Slim. She 
offers her guests Tabs. And she 
commences to tell how a pudgy 
Detroit girl — a University of 
Michigan drop-out, no less 
— has managed to establish 
herself as a cult heroine among 
late-night TV addicts.

Much of what she does, 

Radner says, is drawn from her 
youth. 

“What I do in comedy I call 

bedroom comedy,” she says. 
“It’s like the stuff you did 
in your bedroom with your 
girlfriends during a slumber 
party. I also used to shut myself 
in the brother’s room and 
pantomime to records and do 
stuff in the mirror.”

By her own accounts, Radner 

has an exceptional childhood. 
Born 
in 
1946 
for 
a 
Rita 

Hayworth movie that year, she 
lived in the Palmer Park section 
of Detroit. A plump, ungainly 
girl, Radner recalls spending 
many an hour glued to the TV 

set, delighting to the antics of 
Lucille Ball, Steve Allen, Pinky 
Lee and the folks on “Your 
Show of Shows.”

“I’m a child of television,” 

she says. “I ate all my meals 
in front of the television. As a 
kid I’d pack a lunch in a brown 
paper bag from the kitchen and 
go eat it in front of the TV.”

That probably didn’t help her 

weight problem any, but Radner 
says 
those 
early 
television 

shows influenced the course of 
her comedy.

***

When she wasn’t watching 

television, Radner spent her 
time tagging along 
with Mrs. Gillies, 
a 
nursemaid 
who 

carved 
for 
Gilda 

during most of her 
childhood.

“I grew up with 

her, 
spent 
every 

minute 
with 
her. 

It 
was 
me 
and 

somebody fifty years 
older, and we had 
tea parties together 
and I’d go with her 
on her day off and 
visit 
her 
spinster 

cousins.”

“And that was my 

whole growing up,” 
she 
adds. 
“More 

than having friends 
my own age, she was 
my best friend.”

In 
fact, 
Mrs. 

Gillies, 
now 
84, 

eventually 
became 

Emily Letella, the 
misconstrued dodo 
who rebuts editorials and has 
become one of Radner’s most 
popular characters.

Radner 
broadened 
her 

horizons 
after 
coming 
to 

the University. Spurned by 
Northwestern because of low 
board scores, she majored in 
theater, landed her first job as 
WCBN’s weathergirl and moved 
into an Alice Lloyd triple with 
Alice and Barbara. (“I hated 
it.”) She was even picked up 
for disorderly conduct one day 
for singing and dancing on the 
bank of the Huron River.

One 
of 
her 
greatest 

disappointments, she recalled, 
was not being cast for a 
production 
of 
Troilus 
and 

Cressida 
in 
Mendelssohn 

Theater. 

Realizing that her destiny 

did 
not 
encompass 
the 

Shakespearean stage, Radner 
veered 
off 
into 
children’s 

theater.

“I used to have the loudest 

voice, so I was always the witch 
in the play,” she says.

She was busy with other 

productions, too — plays like 
“Camelot,” 
“Lysistrata” 
and 

“She Stoops to Conquer.”

“I mention it a lot because 

I value that experience,” she 
says. “Coming to where I am 
now, I’ve sat in a costume 
room… and sewed a rolled hem 
on a chiffon skirt. You know, 
the most boring thing… Which 
means I can now remember to 
appreciate the people who are 
doing it for me.

“It’s those years that make 

me feel like I kind of paid my 
dues.”

Radner was so busy with 

children’s theater, in fact, that 
she missed out on many of 
the campus activities which 
epitomized the ‘60s.

***

“Most of my friends were 

in journalism and political 
science,” she says, pausing to 
sip from her can of Tab. “And 
when I’d be going off to do a 
children’s show, they’d be going 
off to protest at some radical 
political meeting. I was always 
feeling guilty about not going 
their way.”

But that guilt has disappeared 

now that Radner is on a show 
which, through parodies and 
satire, is politically vocal. “I 
find it interesting now,” she 
says. “But as guilty as I felt 
then about not being politically 
active when so many of my 
friends were… I’m able to reach 
more people now than was ever 
done back in college.”

Radner didn’t stick out her 

stay at the University. (She 
never finished Hebrew school, 
either.) With one semester to 
go, she left for Canada because, 
she says with a dreamy smile, “I 
fell in love.”

There, she landed a part 

in 
the 
Toronto 
Company’s 

production of Godspell, and 
tried to earn her diploma — 
first through a correspondence 
course with the University 
of Wisconsin, and then night 
classes at the University of 
Toronto. Michigan, however, 
didn’t accept her credits. “I 
have all the education,” she 
beams, “but no diploma.”

Meantime, Radner did some 

National Lampoon shows and 
latched up with a Chicago-
based improvisational group 
called Second City, where many 
of the Prime Time Players 
honed their comedy skills. The 
producer of “Saturday Night 
Live,” who knew her work, 
asked her to join the show. She 
never auditioned.

 ***

So 
here’s 

Gilda 
today, 

sitting in her 
dressing room 
with her Tab, 
her 
crackers 

and 
a 
well-

deserved 
respite 
from 

the 
insanity 

which reigns 
outside 
the 
door. 

Thursdays, 
Fridays 
and 

Saturdays are 
ridiculous 
on the set of 
“Saturday 
Night Live” — 
people 
work 

late into the 
evening — and 
performers 
like 
Radner 

must 
savior 

those 
moments 

when 
they 
can 
cloister 

themselves 
from 
stage 

directions, script changes and 
cue cards.

In this sense, it’s just a job 

as far as Radner’s concerned — 
analogous, she says, to working 
in a deli. Sure she gets sick of 
it, Radner says, but just like the 
guy who slices pastrami, she’s 
got a job to do: she’s a working 
actress on a top rated and that’s 
that.

***

It’s 
late 
afternoon 
and 

Radner is called back into the 
studio to rehearse the Looking 
For Mr. Goodbar skit. Under the 
glare of lights and the scrutiny 
of about a dozen people, she 
sheds her 31 years and becomes 
the little girl with the confused, 
angelic grin. For more than 30 
minutes, she rehearses her 
lines, switches props, suggests 
changes in the script, is told to 
move over, or repeat something, 
or cut such and such from her 
monologue. 
Afterwards, 
she 

departs to fetch a tray of food 
from the NBC cafeteria. Gilda’s 
going to eat dinner and rest 
now, we’re told. She’ll see you 
again later. Just be patient.

Everything 
Radner 

does during the week is in 
preparation for the 90 minute 
show broadcast live Saturday 
nights at 11:30. “I think of it 
as an opening night,” she says 
of the actual show, one of the 
only live programs left on 
network TV. “Each show is like 
the opening night of an under-
rehearsed Off-Broadway show… 
and we’re never getting to do it 
again.”

She 
credits 
her 
stage 

experience 
with 
preparing 

her for the rigors of “Saturday 
Night Live.” And she credits 
“Saturday Night Live” with 
preparing her for what lies 
ahead in her performing future.

“Before I did this show I 

never performed alone, I always 
performed in groups,” she says. 
“Now I have monologues and 
character that work alone. I 
cannot believe it, but I have 
enough material now that I do 
by myself that I can now go 
(somewhere else) and do it.”

What will you be doing at 

age 41, Gilda? Stage? Perhaps. 
Movies? Maybe.

Like a preoccupied child, she 

has no idea where she’ll be ten 
years from now

But, she says, she’ll always 

be in show business. “I have no 
fears of being unemployed,” she 
says confidently.

Even back in her college days, 

Radner thought she’d enter the 
business — either as atheater 
teacher or at the civic theater 
level.

Her 
mom, 
however, 
had 

charted Radner a different 
course.

“She wanted three things 

out of me — to get my teaching 
certificate, to get married and 
to give her grandchildren.”

Did you do any of that, Gilda?

***

“I didn’t do ANYTHING!”
But Mom is learning to accept 

her daughter’s career.

“She just last week gave 

me 
some 
credibility,” 
says 

Radner. “She sent me a letter 
telling me a bunch of friends 
were requesting autographed 
pictures, and she wrote, ‘Well I 
guess you’ve reached stardom.’”

Though Radner says she 

dared never fantasize about 
stardom, she admits having 
fleeting 
premonitions 
of 

celebrity.

“I never thought this would 

happen,” 
she 
says. 
“Yet 
I 

remember coming down the 
stairs of my house one day and 
saying to my boyfriend at the 
time ‘Someday I’ll know kinds 
and princesses.’ I didn’t know 
why I said it.”

And kings and princesses she 

has known. Despite the sweat, 
Gilda enjoys a good measure 
of glamor. TV guest shots. 
Rubbing elbows with a different 
“Saturday Night Live” guest 
host each week. An occasional 
evening at Studio 54.

“I even met a Beatle,” she 

chirps with all the enthusiasm 
of a teenager crashing the 
backstage of a concert. “It was 
George — and he knew who I 
was!”

Undoubtedly. Gilda’s gotten 

a lot of press recently — in 
good places like New York 
Times and People (cover story), 
and not-so-good places like 
the National Enquirer. Such 
exposure 
is 
threatening 
to 

blow her cover as a well-kept 
secret. Because of the show’s 
appeal 
to 
a 
predominantly 

young viewership, Radner is 
a little-known entity among 
the older set and the early-to-
bed generation. That means 
she can roam her adopted New 
York 
unmolested, 
but 
such 

splashy magazine coverage — 
people called her the “Darling 
of ‘Saturday Night Live’” — 
worries her.

For one thing, Radner says 

she’s been unfairly compared 
with 
Chevy 
Chase. 
Chevy 

Chase, you might remember, 
is the comedian who struck 
professional gold on “Saturday 
Night Live,” enjoyed media 
hype and, eventually, left the 
show.

“The media divided him from 

us, called him a star and made 
him leave too soon,” she says. 
“People use that comparison, 
but the thing is, I refuse to 
believe it or live by it or let 
(the press) divide me from the 
group.”

Radner says she worked with 

her fellow Prime Timers too 
long to let the media single her 
out.

“I can never feel like a star 

around here.”

***

Gilda Radner has a theory 

about her acting technique: 
She hasn’t any. “The best thing 
I do,” she says, “is pretend, 
and that’s what acting is to 
me — pretending. Like we 
did the Video Vixens, a punk 
rock group, so I was really 
pretending that I was Patti 
Smith and I was pretending that 
I could sing and that I’m hot 
and dirty and a rock star. And 
then I see the tapeback, and it’s 
me! … But if people like what I 
do, it may be because they know 
they’re seeing me pretend.”

So today, Gilda Radner is 

going to do a little impromptu 
pretending for her guests from 
Ann Arbor. But it’s hard to 
believe that everything she 
does is strictly pretend.

Take her popular juvenile 

roles for instance. How much 
does Radner have to pretend 
when she herself frequently 
talks like a kid and putters 
around NBC with black and 
white Oxfords and a little green 
piece of yarn keeping her pony 
tail in place?

“I find them (juvenile roles) 

closer now to the child in me 
than anytime else in my life,” 
she says. “I think there’s a time 
when you can get back to it … 
and have no inhibitions about 
it.

***

“I don’t know whether it has 

something to do with the work 
ethic or about being secure of 
myself as a woman, but I can 
take a child role. Maybe since 
I’m having a career and making 
a success it’s all right for me to 
be a kid. I don’t know. I love it. I 
can sit … and play all day.”

Her Roseanne Rosannadana 

can’t be strictly pretend, either. 
Roseanne (the name is a take-
off on a New York newswoman) 
is a raucous, befuddled, frizzy-
haired consumer reporter who 
appears on the show’s Weekend 
Update spoof and does gross 
things like pick imaginary food 
particles from her teeth and 
talks about everything except 
consumer 
affairs. 
Just 
like 

Roseanne, Radner claims she 
“has her filthy side.” She proved 
it by attributing her low college 
board scored to her ill-timed 
menstrual cramps — a funny 
tidbit, but gross nonetheless.

Radner’s 
most 
recent 

character is Lisa Luebner, who, 
like her creator in earlier days, 
is a nerd. Unlike her creator, 
Lisa 
suffers 
from 
chronic 

asthmas and other respiratory 
disorders.

“I’m a little bit like her 

today,” says Radner, muffling 
her voice, looking off into space 
and snorting back imaginary 
mucus, “Cranky.”

“You know when you have 

a cold, your world gets so 
insulated?” 
Radner/Leubner 

asks, sounding sick. “Well, she 
always has a cold and asthma, 
and 
she 
says 
things 
like, 

‘Salutations from the United 
Nations.’”

Lisa 
Leubner 
recently 

appeared on an interview show 
spoof to discuss her new book, 
“The Class of ’77,” an account of 
what her high school classmates 
did during summer vacation.

Then there’s Rhonda Weiss, 

the JAP.

Despite 
Radner’s 
Jewish 

upbringing, 
she 
says 
she 

avoided becoming the typical 
Jewish 
American 
Princess, 

probably because she attended 
a non-Jewish high school in 
Detroit.

But Radner becomes a pretty 

believable Princess when she 
lays on her Borscht-Belt brogue.

Using hand motions and 

sounding catty, “New Yawkish,” 
and 
nasal, 
Gilda 
gives 
a 

sampling of Rhonda:

“You’re talking cramps? I 

get them two weeks before, one 
week during and three days 
after. We’re talking an entire 
month of cramps.”

***
Her character set aside, the 

woman who says, “I am that 
girl who was funny in school” 
has got to leave now and be 
funny at rehearsals. The next 
day, she’ll have to be funny 
before a studio audience and 
several million others watching 
at home. Being genuinely funny 
under those conditions sounds 
like the tallest of orders, but 
for Gilda Radner it’s a snap. 
That’s because Gilda Radner 
— loud, obnocious, childish, 
gross, nerdy Gilda Radner — is 
all the people we’ve known and 
laughed at over the years. She’s 
us in sillier times.

Comedy for a Twitter age

The 
founders 
of 
LinkedIn 

certainly never envisioned “Being 
funny on the internet” as an 
acceptable headline for a profile 
on their social media platform 
— but here we are. People tweet 
two-bit one-liners, people get 
paid for tweeting two-bit one-
liners, people consider tweeting 
two-bit one-liners their day job 
— and nowadays for good reason. 
Amateur 
Twitter 
comedienne 

Kelly Oxford turned a few years 
of tweets into TV pilots bought by 
CBS and NBC, as one example. The 
paradigm shift in modern humor 
that has come thanks to the advent 
of social media remains hard to 
wrap one’s head around, but trying 
to chronicle the ways in which 
the art and form of comedy have 
adapted is an earnest place where 
we can start to understand it all.

With a genesis in countless 

hours 
of 
caffeine-fueled 

brainstorming, 
Twitter 
was 

birthed as an alternative, short-
form 
communication 
tool 
for 

podcasting startup Odeo. But what 
started as a meager sketch of ideas 
became significant enough for 
employees of Odeo to ditch their 
initial aspirations and turn Twitter 
into their bonafide dayjob.

And 
despite 
the 
founders’ 

audacity in making Twitter their 
everyday focus, pinning down 
the actual purpose of the service 
was still a task at hand for them 
— co-founder Evan Williams was 
interviewed in 2009 saying “[with] 
Twitter, it wasn’t clear what it was. 
They called it a social network, 
they called it microblogging, but it 
was hard to define, because it didn’t 
replace anything. There was this 
path of discovery with something 
like that, where over time you 
figure out what it is.”

Considering Evan’s words, it 

starts to get easier to understand 
why Twitter has assumed such a 
significant space in the realm of 

modern entertainment. There’s 
some beauty to find in the notion 
that the Twitter we know is 
fundamental to the culture we live 
in, and that the Twitter we knew 
is significant to a culture that has 
come and gone — all at the hands 
of the general populace. Twitter’s 
democratization of culture has 
forced the service into wearing 
many hats in regards to how it 
serves the public sphere — from 
breaking news, to proselytization, 
to citizen advocacy, to (most 
importantly) 
being 
a 
fertile 

breeding ground for anything 
and everything our generation 
finds humorous and entertaining 
nowadays — and thus, it serves as 
the all-encompassing anchor of the 
millennial zeitgeist.

Thanks to the character limit 

of tweets, messages and jokes had 
to be poetically succinct to gain 
any traction — and leveling those 
constraints on creatives gave birth 
to a completely new approach 
to joke structure and humor. In 
came fleeting phases of memes 
and one-liners, all with shelf lives 
of no more than a few weeks. 
Andy Warhol’s notion of everyone 
having their 15 minutes of fame 
became an undeniable reality as 
people’s eyeballs shifted from HBO 
standup specials to their timeline 
as a source for their laughs — and in 
that process, unconventional stars 
were born too.

When a standup comedian is 

funny on Twitter, it doesn’t come 
as much of a surprise (people 
we conventionally find funny 
remaining funny on other mediums 
isn’t a terribly novel thought). But 
what has come as a surprise are the 
many amateur personalities that 
have used Twitter as an exclusive 
medium to cultivate their craft 
and comedic brand (despite their 
audiences only knowing them 
for crass usernames and crudely 
drawn cartoon profile pictures, 
among other things) — and those 
personalities are changing what 
it means to be a mainstream 
comedian nowadays.

Take Brandon Wardell. If you 

don’t know him for his semi-
unintelligible tweets or how he 
looks as if someone brought an 
anime stock character to real life, 
you might (directly or indirectly) 
know him for the many memes he 
has created or popularized (does 
“Dicks out for Harambe” ring a 
bell to you?). His rise as a comedian 
couldn’t be more different than 
the veterans who came before 
him, either. Thanks to a small 
PR bump after being featured 
as an opener on a Bob Odenkirk 
stand up tour, Wardell amassed a 
following on Twitter for regularly 
publishing absurdist humor that 
touched at the (pretentious, vapid, 
materialistic, etc.) fundamentals 
of being a millennial. He performs 
on occasion in his current home 
of L.A., but his online presence 
still remains his bread and butter. 
Wardell told Rolling Stone in 2016 
“Twitter is ... the purest form of 
expression that I have. There’s 
something super-visceral about 
Twitter. It’s just a lot of like brain 
vomit.”

And it’s that reason why Twitter 

comedy resonates so well with 
today’s population. Comedy used to 
be constrained by a set of concrete 
conventions regarding structure, 
content, delivery and the like — 
and to some extent, the legacy of 
those constraints still linger. But 
the Twitter age has deconstructed 
what it means to be “funny” — 
and with that, the craft of being a 
comedian as well. Comedy as an 
art form is still going through its 
early stages of transition thanks to 
the age of social media, and how we 
see personalities like Wardell (and 
others) flourish is yet to be clearly 
determined, but if there’s one thing 
that can be concretely drawn from 
these observations, it’s that humor 
acts as a common plane for a 
culture to find commonality in.

COURTESY OF MEGAN GANZ

It’s Always Sunny in AA: 
Alum Megan Ganz talks 
comedy and the art of TV

As a current student in SAC 

311 (Screenwriting for TV), 
I’m always wondering how, 
exactly, people break into the 
industry. TV writing would 
be, in this writer’s opinion, the 
best job ever. But someone’s 
done it — and from Michigan, 
no less! Megan Ganz is an 
alumnus who writes for “The 
Last Man on Earth” and is 
a producer on “It’s Always 
Sunny 
In 
Philadelphia.” 
I 

reached out to her to figure out 
how, exactly, she pulled it off, 
and to learn more about a day 
in her life.

Where are you from, and 

when did you graduate from 
the University of Michigan?

I am from Kalamazoo, but 

I was born in Ann Arbor while 
my father was finishing up 
dental school at the University. 
I graduated in 2006.

What activities did you 

take part in at Michigan that 
helped to start your career 
in comedy? Have you always 
been interested in working 
in comedy?

I wrote for the Michigan 

Every Three Weekly which 
was a huge help to the start 
of my comedy career. Both 
Mad Magazine and The Onion 
contacted 
the 
E3W 
about 

internship opportunities, and 
I applied for both and those 
were my first two jobs in 
comedy. The internship at The 
Onion eventually lead to my 
first full-time writing job as a 
staff writer.

I have been interested in 

comedy for as long as I can 
remember — since my father 
first showed me Marx brothers 
movies when I was six years 
old. When I was a teenager, my 
mother bought me a collection 
of Onion articles, and from 
that day forward I wanted 
to specifically write for The 
Onion. But writing for TV 
wasn’t a goal of mine until 
much later in life.

What was your first job in 

the industry? How did you 
end up where you are now?

My first internship was at 

Mad Magazine during the 
summer between my junior 
and senior years. They were 
the first ones to pay me for a 
joke. It was an idea for a fold-
in drawn by Al Jaffee, and 
I framed the check (after I 
cashed it, of course). After I 
graduated, I moved to New 
York for an internship at The 
Onion. Eventually I was hired 
to the writing staff and then 
became an editor. During my 
time on staff, we wrote a story 
about “This American Life,” 
which resulted in Ira Glass 
doing a piece on The Onion. 
Some agents in L.A. heard me 
on that “TAL” episode, and 
they called me, and that’s how 
I got agents. They convinced 
me to start writing packets 
to try to get hired to a TV 
show. After three years with 
The Onion, I left for a job 

at Demetri Martin’s sketch 
show, 
“Important 
Things 

With Demetri Martin.” That 
moved me out to L.A. and into 
TV writing. At that time I was 
a huge fan of “Community,” 
which was still in its first 
season. I knew Donald Glover 
in New York, and I started 
watching the show because 
he was on it. My agents 
submitted me for season two, 
and that lead to my first job on 
a sitcom. After “Community,” 
I went to “Modern Family” for 
a few years, then “It’s Always 
Sunny in Philadelphia,” and 
now I write for “The Last 
Man on Earth,” which is what 
I’m supposed to be doing 
instead of responding to these 
questions. (Shhh... don’t tell 
my boss.)

Which 
shows 
do 
you 

currently work on?

Right now I am writing for 

“The Last Man on Earth” 
until February, at which point 
I’m planning on returning to 
“Sunny” for their thirteenth 
season.

What’s your favorite part 

of the job?

Just writing jokes. It’s not 

a big enough part of the job. I 
spend most of my time sitting 
around a table talking, trying 
to come up with storylines or 
conflicts between characters. 
Very 
little 
time 
is 
spent 

pitching actual jokes, because 
you can’t put icing on a cake 
before you bake it.

TV writing/producing is 

often described as a dream 
job. Have you always found 
that to be the case, or are 
there any drawbacks?

It is a dream job. That aside, 

whoever said, “If you do what 
you love, you’ll never work a day 
in your life” was a liar. I work 
plenty of long, hard days. And 
I spent years writing comedy 
and not being paid for it. But I 

love what I do, so it’s worth the 
struggle. When you truly care 
about what it is you’re doing, 
the lows are pretty low. But the 
highs are spectacular. And at 
this point I’m not qualified to 
do anything else.

Why do you think TV 

(and, specifically, scripted 
comedy) is seeing such a 
creative surge?

Well, the easy answer is 

because there used to be three 
channels and now there are 
hundreds. 
You 
don’t 
even 

have to sell a show anymore, 
you can just post it online 
and people will find it. But 
the more complicated answer 
might have something to do 
with 
the 
current 
political 

climate and how much people 
want and need to escape from 
reality.

What do you see as the 

future of comedy on TV?

The future of comedy won’t 

be on TV. It will be on the 
internet. Gone are the days 
when people rush home to see 
their favorite show when it 
airs. People don’t want to wait, 
they want to binge, so I think 
shows will have fewer episodes 
per season and probably end 
after three seasons instead of 
nine. But what do I know?

What are your favorite 

shows to watch right now?

Oh 
boy. 
I 
watch 
way, 

way too much TV, even for 
someone who works in TV. A 
very short list would include 
“Veep,” 
“Kimmy 
Schmidt,” 

“Game of Thrones,” “Atlanta,” 
“Bob’s Burgers,” “Episodes,” 
“Rick and Morty,” “Last Week 
Tonight,” “Law and Order: 
SVU,” “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” 
and “Friday Night Dinner,” 
which 
is 
a 
great 
British 

show I love. That’s not even 
counting how many times I’ve 
rewatched “30 Rock,” which is 
probably too many.
