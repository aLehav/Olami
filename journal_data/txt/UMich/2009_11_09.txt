Questions loom in Em St falout

Report: Many college
presidents say they
can't fix their athletic
departments' budgets
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
The majority of Division IA
presidents said in a recent study
that they feel they have no con-
trol over their respective athletic
department budgets. But Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
says she's an exception to the rule.
The Knight Commission on
Intercollegiate Athletics issued a
report last month that found uni-
versity presidents feel powerless in
combating the rising costs associ-
ated with intercollegiate sports.
The KnightCommissionisacollege
sports think tank operated by col-
lege administration heavyweights
from around the country - includ-
ing University of Michigan Regent
Andrea Fischer Newman, who is a
member of the organization.
The report - which was based
on interviews this spring and sum-
mer with 95 of the 120 presidents of
Football Bowl Subdivision schools
- found the majority of college

presidents recognized a need to
restructure athletic departments
to reduce costs. But many of the
presidents reported that they don't
feel like they're in a position to cre-
ate that change.
"Presidents would like serious
change, but don't see themselves as
the force for the changes needed,
nor have they identified an alter-
native force they believe could be
effective," the report stated.
In an interview late last month
with The Michigan Daily, Univer-
sity President Coleman said she
could not remember if she hadbeen
interviewed for the study, but said
she had read the report and doesn't
think the findings are true for the
University.
"I understand that maybe a lot
of presidents feel like they can't do
anything, but I guess I don't feel
that way about myself at Michi-
gan," Coleman said.
She added: "Maybe I'm very
privileged to be in this circum-
stance', (but) I do feel like we have
good control."
While the Athletic Department's
finances are separate from those of
the academic operations of the Uni-
versity, Coleman said Michigan has
had a tradition of firm presidential
control over intercollegiate athlet-

Two students say
they gave AAPD
evidence, which the
police lost
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
More than a week after the
violent Halloween beating on
Elm Street that left a 19-year-old
man hospitalized, police won't
confirm whether any of the

alleged attackers have been iden-
tified or arrested.
Two students who witnessed
the violent beating said they
were able to take photos and a
video of the incident, which they
claim they turned over to the
Ann Arbor Police Department as
evidence.
LSA seniors Brian Barton and
Zachary Ward said they took
pictures of brutal beating on
Barton's digital camera shortly
before the attack, then a video
once it began. After giving a
statement to AAPD, Barton said

he handed over his memory stick
to be used as possible evidence.
The next day, Barton said he
received a call from an AAPD
officer who had been in posses-
sion of his memory card tell-
ing him that the memory card
had been lost before police had
viewed it.
Barton and Ward said they
believe the police department
has dropped the ball on the
whole situation.
Ward said he believes the
memory card could have been
essential in identifying the

assailants and that its loss dem-
onstrates the police department's
mishandling of the incident.
"Losing the memory card was
a vital piece of evidence," Ward
said. "That could have easily
identified the people involved or
at least been on the news to show
people and make them aware of
the current problems with vio-
lence on campus."
AAPD Sgt. Mike Lance, who
arrived at the scene of the beat-
ing, was unable to comment
on the loss of the memory card

" WASHINGTON
GOP officials say
Dems put agenda
ahead of country
Democrats just don't get the elec-
tion message from voters and are
pushing a liberal, big government
agenda at their party's peril, Repub-
lican officials said yesterday as they
predicted a political price after the
majority's victory on health care.
Voters are "tired of the borrow-
ing, the spending, the bailouts, the
takeovers," said Rep. Mike Pence of
Indiana, the No. 3 House GOP leader,
pointing to GOP victories in guberna-
torial races in Virginia and New Jer-
sey last week.
The Democratic-controlled House
narrowly approved a health care bill
Saturday night, with 39 Democrats
voting against it and a single Repub-
lican voting in its favor. President
Barack Obama's top domestic initia-
tive faces a high hurdle in the Sen-
ate, which must pass its own bill and
then negotiate a compromise with the
House to craft a final measure.
"On a narrow partisan vote, the
Democrats put their liberal, big gov-
ernment agenda ahead of the Ameri-
canpeople,"Pencesaid."IfDemocrats
keep ignoring the American people,
their party's going to be history in
about a year."

After weeks of debate, Iraq election
law passes, sets up national vote

Passage avoids crisis
that almost delayed
troop withdrawal
BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraq's parlia-
ment ended weeks of debate yes-
terday and passed a long-delayed
law paving the way for the planned
January election to go forward,
sidestepping a crisis that could have
delayed the U.S. troop withdrawal.
The decision appeared to resolve
a key sticking point - who will be
allowed to vote in the disputed,
oil-rich city of Kirkuk. The issue
had threatened to delay Iraq's key
parliamentary elections, which
in turn would affect how quickly
American combat forces could
leave the country.
In a sign of how intensely Wash-
ington was followingthe debate, U.S.
Ambassador Christopher Hill could
be seen shuttling between various
political factions before the law's
passage. President Barack Obama,
speaking at the White House, wel-
comed the new legislation.
"This is an important milestone
as the Iraqi people continue to take
responsibilityfortheirfuture.I want
to congratulate Iraq's leaders for
reaching this agreement," Obama
said. "The United States will con-
tinue to stand with Iraq as a strong
partner and as a friend."
Iraq's prime minister, Nouri al-
Maliki, in a statement posted on his
Web site, hailed the election law's
passage as a "historic victory of the
will of the people," and described it
as a strong response to the people
who are trying to undermine the

country's security.
The U.S. ambassador, speaking
to reporters after the vote, said the
American troop drawdown will
proceed asscheduled. Military com-
manders have said the U.S. troop
withdrawal would start in earnest
about 60 days after the vote, the idea
being that the country would be on
stable footing by then.
"What is important is that with
the election law, we are very much
on schedule for the drawdown," Hill
said.
Under the president's plan, all
U.S. combat troops will be out of the
country by the end of August 2010,
leaving about 50,000 trainers and
support troops, who in turn would
leave by the end of 2011.
It was not clear exactly when
the election would be held - Jan.

repeatedly delayed by sharp dis-
agreements over how voting would
take place in the northern city of
Kirkuk, claimed by both Arabs and
Kurds and a major flashpoint in the
country.
Kurds consider Kirkuk a Kurd-
ish city and want it part of their
self-ruled region in northern Iraq.
During the rule of former dictator
Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands
of Kurds were displaced under a
forced plan by Saddam to make
Kirkuk predominantly Arab, though
many of these have since returned.
The Arab-led central government
vehemently opposes anything that
would remove Kirkuk from its con-
trol.
Under the legislation passed yes-
terday, the vote in Kirkuk would

be held just like in other regions
around the country, but the votes -
and those in other disputed areas -
could be subject to a special review
if it is determined that there was a
large population increase.Arabs and
the Turkomens claim Kurds have
packed the city with immigrants to
tip the balance in their favor.
The legislation did not include
any guaranteed seats for Arab and
Turkomen lawmakers from Kirkuk,
something which had been dis-
cussed in earlier versions.
Both Kurds and Arabs appeared
to claim victory after the some-
times raucous parliament session
that was televised live on Iraq state
TV.
"This is a good law because it
occurred after broad agreement,

and it presents a solution to a prob-
lem that we have now solved. It
doesn't achieve all our (Kurdish)
ambitions, but it achieves a balance,"
said Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish
lawmaker.
But Omar al-Jabouri, a Sunni
member of parliament, called the
voting "a great victory," because, he
said, Kurds were forced to accept
special circumstances in regards to
the Kirkuk voting.
The law passed with141votes, but
it was not immediately known how
many of the parliament's 275 mem-
bers voted against the legislation
or even attended the session. Low
turnouts are common in Iraq's par-
liament, which often does not have
enoughpeopletoformthenecessary
138-person quorum.

16 as originally planned or a later
date in January. The head of the
Independent High Electoral Com-
mission, Faraj al-Haidari, told The
Associated Press that he expected
the vote to be held within a week
of Jan. 16.
Deputy Parliament Speaker,
Khalid al-Attiyah said it would
likely be held January 21 or23. The
Iraqi constitution mandates that
the vote takes place inJanuary, but
does not specify which day.
Once the legislation is approved
by the president and his two vice
presidents, the election commis-
sion will decide how many days are
needed to hold the vote, al-Haidari
said. Then the commission will
send a letter to parliament and to
the prime minister to inform them
of their decision.
The law's passage had been

Western Michigan University has
decided to open a recruiting office in
Royal Oak and plans to start offering
"new academic programming" in the
Detroit area as well.
The Kalamazoo-based school says
southeastern Michigan now supplies

Royal Oak office gives it a presence in
the heart ofthe region.
The university says its three-year
lease starts Jan. 1.
New academic offerings in the
Detroit area would be through West-
ern Michigan's Extended University
Programs.
Vice Provost Keith Hearit says
Western Michigan has started talks
with Oakland Community College for
a partnership that could lead to stu-
dents starting their bachelor's degree
work at Oakland.

served eight years in prison for a murder he didn't commit.
But thanks to the involvement of the University Law School's newly
formed Innocence Clinic, Province is being released. This success
shows the importance of the Innocence Clinic, a group that works
to exonerate wrongfully convicted prisoners, and also highlights a
deeper problem within Michigan's justice system. Wrongfully con-
victed prisoners shouldn't have to depend on law student activists
to compensate for the mistakes of the justice system. Instead, the
state must reform its system of public defense and appeals.

Making the grade

Province was convicted in 2001 of the
murder of Rene Hunter. Province only
become a suspect after Larry Wiley, a key
witness for the prosecution, claimed that
Province and his brother were respon-
sible for the murder. But Wiley recanted
his testimony after being diagnosed with
cancer earlier this year. In response, Prov-
ince contacted the Innocence Clinic to
help him clear his name. After working on
the case for nine months, the Innocence
Clinic proved Province's innocence, using
Wiley's perjured testimony as proof and
uncovering police memos that incriminat-
ed a gang in the murder.
The Innocence Clinic is a great learn-
ing tool for law students, but it's also doing
important work to help wrongfully con-
victed people. Resources like the Inno-
cence Clinic fulfill a vital role in fixing the
mistakes of the justice system. The Inno-
cence Clinic has the potential to correct
those mistakes that get lost in the bureau-
cracy of the state's bloated justice system.
It is an invaluable resource for prisoners
who know they've been wrongly convicted
but can't make their case through conven-
tional channels.
But the Innocence Clinic can only do
so much, and it's unfair and unrealistic
to expect organizations like this one to
clean up the system's messes. Every indi-
vidual convicted of a crime deserves an
exceptional legal support staff. Michigan
is clearly in need of reforms to its justice

system so that innocence and guilt can be
fairly determined in every case.
One of Michigan's principal problems
is that its justice system suffers from
inadequate support for public defense.
Public defenders - lawyers appointed by
the state to defendants who can't afford
their own attorney - are overworked and
underpaid, increasing the number of mis-
takes made. In Detroit, public defenders
haven't been given raises in 30 years, so
many take more cases than they can han-
dle for the money. And funding for public
defense in Michigan is damagingly low,
so sometimes the necessary research to
prove a defendant's innocence isn't avail-
able. To make matters worse, Michigan's
court system is excessively restrictive and
rarely grants appeals.
These problems need to be addressed if
the state is going to reduce its number of
wrongful convictions - and eliminating
wrongful convictions should be the goal of
every justice system. People's lives hang in
the balance. It is a travesty of justice when
some people are incarcerated for years
for crimes they didn't commit because of
the barriers within the system to proving
innocence after a false conviction.
Dwayne Province was fortunate that
new evidence came to light and that the
Innocence Clinic was there to help him.
But all wrongfully convicted prisoners
deserve the same right to fight their con-
victions and prove their innocence.

There are wonderful things
about being a GSI.
Grading is not one of them.
For every hard-
ship we foist upon
students in the
form of an essay or
exam, our students
return the favor25,
50 or 75 times in
the form of exams
to grade or essays
to evaluate.
Some under- PATRICK
graduates - a dis- O'MAHEN
tinct minority, but
a vocal and annoy-
ing one - vigor-
ously question the qualifications of
GSIs to evaluate undergraduate work.
These studentseneedto take a deep
breath, count to 10 and realize that
GSIs and professors puta great deal of
work into developing clear, fair grad-
ing standards for exams and papers.
All GSIs have stories about stu-
dents who just couldn't accept their
grade. I once had a student formally
challenge six of the seven grades
she earned on essays. Another stu-
dent once followed me around for
10 months whining about the 'C'
he earned on his final exam essay
because he "needed" to get into law
school. He even thought it would be
a good idea to call my personal cell
phone before 8 a.m. to plead his case.
My personal favorite was the
student who failed a midterm and
refused to accept that there could
possibly be anything wrong with his
exam other than me not being able
to read his handwriting. He seemed
quite offended that I wasn't willing to
serve as his personal typist on future
exams to eliminate the problem.
So how did I justify his grade?
The blunt answer is I know a great
deal more than my students about the

topic I teach, and Ijudged his answer
worth a 'C-.' Deal with it, punk. E
The more nuanced answer is that
GSIs spend quite a bit of time devel-
oping questions that try to objective-
ly measure knowledge. We endlessly3
discuss grading rubrics and rigor-
ously cross-check our grades to bes
sure that we're awarding similarc
grades to similar answers. t
Last term, for example, I taughtt
a course in which the lion's share
of GSI-professor meetings were
devoted to discussing specific mul-
tiple choice questions for quizzes
and exams. After an hour, we would
leave the meeting having analyzed
and reworded each question within
an inch of its life. We were reason-
ably happy that we were asking clear,
challenging and fair questions about
the subject material.
That work was worth it, becausec
multiple choice questions are the best1
way to measure objective knowledge.c
A well-written multiple choice ques-
tion removes all of the subjectivity c
of grading. Jeffrey Mondak, a politi-
cal scientist at the University of Illi-t
nois who studies Americans' relatives
levels of political knowledge, wrote1
in an American Journal of Political
Science article entitled "Developing
Valid Knowledge Scales" that simply
asking someone to identify Joseph 7
Biden might lead to a number of cor-
rect answers including "U.S. Vicet
President," "a Democrat" and "thatc
guy with a really bad comb-over."
Scoring a correct answer introduces1
levels of subjective judgment. In
contrast, a multiple choice questionj
with four incorrect answers and
one answer stating "vice president"
clearly tests knowledge of Biden's
political significance.
The problem is that multiple
choice questions are only good at
testing simple forms of knowledge.

Theycan'tdo much to measure deep-
er understanding and nuanced rea-
soning, which is the point of going to
college in the first place. That's why
we make you write essays and show
your work when you do calculus
problems: We want you to demon-
strate your mastery of more compli-
cated subjects. Of course, evaluating
these ideas necessitates the subjec-
tive judgment of an instructor.
Sometimes, you
really do deserve
that'C-' grade.
To cancel out unwarranted bias in
our subjective grading, GSIs spend
long hours working together to go
over essay questions after the tests
and papers get turned in. We look
over each other's students' papers,
arguing over what grade to assign
them. We usually agree quickly,
although a few cases always prove to
be tricky.
But even with all that work, we
still get questions. Many questions
are reasonable requests for expla-
nations and many students go away
with a better understanding of why
they earned a particular grade. And
occasionally, GSIs do make mistakes.
But at the end of the day, a few
blissfully ignorant and profoundly
stubborn students still want us to
justify an essay grade.
Again, here's the answer: Because
we're teachers, we know more than
you about the subject-of this course,
and we say so.

I went to Catholic school for six years and,
despite not actually being Catholic, I loved my
education there. Many of my friends berate
Catholicism for being a dogmatic and nar-
row-minded religion, but I usually defend the
Catholic Church and enlighten them on the
liberal stances the Church has on the poor, the
distribution of wealth, the death penalty and
war. But as Pope Benedict XVI's papacy has
continued, and with his recent announcement
to basically accept homophobic Anglicans back
into the Catholic fold, I am finding it harder
and harder to defend this religion.
On Oct. 20, 2009, the Vatican released an
Apostolic Constitution creating a new Angli-
can Rite within the Catholic Church. The
decree is aimed at those who are disgruntled
with the Anglican Church's acceptance of
homosexuality and ordination of gay and
female clergy. Pope Benedict XVI is allowing
Anglican Church members to join the Catholic
Church, and is seeing to it that certain Angli-
can traditions, like married priests and aspects
of their liturgy, are preserved. He is effectively
pandering to fundamentalist Anglicans. Catho-
lics should feel appalled by this. Not only does
it continue to diminish the Catholic Church's
stance within the secular world, it furthers the
image of Catholicism as a hateful and bigoted
religion.
The Vatican spun this as an ushering in of a
new era of Christian unity, using the papacy to
fill a bigger role in Christian dialogue. But Pope
Benedict XVI's offer is not a sign of openness
but a consolidation of hate, solidifying a coali-
tion of those who stand so fervently against
gay rights and female clergy. The pope is using
the new members he will receive to drown out
calls for reform and progress within the Catho-
lic Church, and his decision is marking a dark
day for anyone hoping for dialogue about social
equality within the Catholic community.
This decision comes shortly after Pope
Benedict XVI's reinstatement of four excom-
municated bishops in January. All belonged
to a Catholic society that stood in protest of
the modernizing reforms of the Second Ecu-

menical Council of the Vatican, which led to
speculation about the pope's support of Church
reformations. One reinstated bishop even made
comments denying the existence of the Holo-
caust, damaging years of effort to ease Jewish-
Christian tensions and furthering the disunity
caused by this papacy.
Both of these examples are evidence of Pope
Benedict XVI growing his conservative fac-
tion. By doing so, he shuts off communication
to progressives not only within the Church but
also in the secular world. This is more dan-
gerous than anybody seems to realize. A rel-
evant Catholic Church, one that speaks to the
secular world and acknowledges its stances as
well, can be an incredibly powerful voice. It
can become an advocate for increased human
rights, economic equality and non-violentreso-
lutions. Historically, the Church fulfilled this
role in the nineteenth century. After all, it was
the Catholic Church that played a major part in
workers' rights movements and gave voices to
oppressed people, such as those in El Salvador.
The Catholic Church doesn't have to stand
in accordance with every opinion of the secu-
lar world, and indeed it shouldn't. It has a
right to its own opinion. But as Pope Benedict
XVI's papacy reaches further and further into
the traditionalist base, the Church becomes
less and less significant to actual changes in
peoples' lives. It negates itself and becomes a
meaningless institution with no power outside
of itself.
A growing number of people will continue
to support the morality of homosexuality and
the ordination of women and gay clergy. This
is an inevitable truth. The Vatican has a choice
to either examine its own stance and begin an
open dialogue or simply ignore the opinions
of more progressive members. The choices of
Pope Benedict XVI, specifically with the cre-
ation of the new Anglican Rite,.reflect the lat-
ter, which ostracises non-traditionalists and
continues the Catholic Church on a dangerous
path toward irrelevancy.
William Butler is an LSA freshman.

TO THE DAILY:
The views expressed on the Daily's editorial page
on Thursday advanced several flawed arguments with
regard to student support for the millage and participa-
tion in the election that we, the College Democrats, must
address (Students wrong to push millage on property own-
ers, 11/05/2009).
The millage would have helped fill the gap in K-12 edu-
cation funding that the state legislature created with its
drastic cuts to the budget for this fiscal year. Tax revenue
has fallen due to the state of the economy which, com-
bined with the Republican-controlled Senate's decisionto
block any new revenue sources, made program cuts inevi-
table. Educated students are the foundation of Michigan's
economic recovery. Michigan's students will not only cre-
ate a more capable workforce but also spur the growth of
new industry in the state.
As University students, we recognize early education as
a stepping stone for higher achievement. Andrea Siklosi's
letter on student election participation was, therefore,
fundamentally flawed. First of all, she is simply incorrect
to assert that the millage would not have affected Uni-
versity students. Many students rent houses off campus
- the millage would have levied a tax on these proper-
ties and landlords would have passed it onto tenants as a
rent increase. Her reasoning reflects a fundamental lack
of understanding of basic economic principles and hous-
ing realities at the University.
But in any case, it's ridiculous to suggest that participa-
tion in the political process should be contingent on pay-
ing taxes. By Siklosi's logic, students probably should not
have the right to vote at all, because they do not contrib-
ute a significant amount to total tax revenues. Addition-
ally, her piece implies that votes cast by wealthier people
(who typically pay higher taxes) ought to be weighted
more heavily than votes cast by people of lesser economic
status. This backward logic is absurd. our country decid-
ed long ago that the franchise should not be conditional
on wealth or property. It's tragic to see that some stu-
dents on this campus have forgotten our nation's history
of restricted voting rights.
We are disappointed that the millage failed to pass and
students in Washtenaw County will suffer substantial
cuts in their education as a result of the voters' decision.
But policy debates aside, we are insulted that this edito-
rial page would carry pieces tarnished with such absurd
reasoning.
College Democrats is a group of students who are
interested in Democratic and progressive politics. We are
unashamed about any of our activism and we will con-
tinue to support efforts in Ann Arbor and throughout the
state of Michigan.

TO THE DAILY:
Students growing up in low-income communities, many
of whom are African-American or Hispanic, face daunting
challenges from the moment they are born. These students
frequently aren't given a sense oftheir potential to achieve at
high levels. I can personally remember countless incidents
of being labeled as less capable than others simply because
of where I was born and the color of my skin. It's clear to
me now that I was never less capable. But even with support
fromboth of my parents, I remember thinking I wasn't good
enough. Ijoined TeachForAmericabecause I realized I had
the opportunity to serve as an example of success for stu-
dents coming from similar backgrounds as my own. It's the
type of example that is tangible, not one that students hear
or read about but one they have the opportunity to develop
a personal relationship with. It's the type of example that I
craved as a child in order to truly believe I was capable of the
potential my parents said I had.
As a first-year teacher in the Houston IndependentSchool
District, I'malreadybeginningtounderstand howpowerful
this example can be for my first graders. One ofmy students,
who I will call Natalie, recently approached me and said,
"Ms. James, guess what? I want to be a teacher just like you
when I growup." Natalie is one of 31 students I willhave the
opportunity to work with this year.
The daunting and exciting thing is that there are so many
students like Natalie across our country - students who are
simply waiting to be given the educational opportunities
they deserve. Here in Houston, 77 percent of Caucasian 10th
graders in HISD met grade-level requirements on state-
administered exams, while only 41 percent of Hispanic
students and 35 percent of African-American students met
minimum grade-level standards on the same exams. There
is a desperate need in low-income communities for more
teachers who can serve as models of success in education
and in life and who will do whatever it takes to make sure
their students achieve at high levels.
Teach For America has given me the opportunity to help
fight one of our nation's greatest injustices. I will have the
chance to impact students that face challenges similar to
ones I encountered. As a Teach For America participant, I
have the opportunity to inspire a passion for learning and
a sense of self-esteem in each of my students. It's by far the
most difficult and rewarding challenge I have faced to date.
As University students, we are uniquely positioned to
expand the academic potential and life prospects of stu-
dents growing up in low-income communities. We know
what it takes to succeed and we are committed to making
sure others have the same higher education opportunities
we received. I urge you to join me in working to give every
student like Natalie the opportunity to someday attend the
University of Michigan and lead her own classroom.

The ichganDaiy -michganailcomMonay, oveber9, 009- 5

The death of the album

Making your music lo-fi doesn't make it sincere.
It doesn't make it more "authentic." The ramshackle
charm of Io-fi music can often add a nice sentimental
charge to an already-electrified song (Slanted and
Enchanted by Pavement, Bee Thou-
sand by Guided By Voices, the
early '90s in general). That said, it
should not be used as a crutch or a
substitute for dynamic songman-
ship. And really, it should not be a
genre, though it happens to lend
itself well to quirky, sleeve-on-
heart indie music.
But today, with Garage Band
" and the advent of laptops as portable,
do-it-yourself recording studios, the "lo-fi" aesthetic
has mutated into a bandwagon of egalitarian mim-
,icry and massive carrying capacity. Anyone can be
a musician now. And as much as I love free artistic
expression, the increasingly rapid rate at which gen-
uine ingenuity is flung into the populist meat grinder
for mass reproduction is dizzying.
A few years ago, Animal Collective was still
skimming the waters of the indie underground, pos-
sessing a sort of subterranean mystique. I remem-
bering hearing Collective for the first time and
being absolutely repulsed. The banshee wails and
possessed-baby gurgling noises turned me off to the
point where I deemed it "not music." While this was
largely a sign of my musical greenness at the time,
the point is that the music was subversive enough
to scare away aKid A-bred 12th-grader. And the
inimitable style of this truly unconventional band
has slipped on some lubricating hype, spread like
wildfire across the Internet though cattle-call blogs
and forums and been snatched up by rabid indie ama-
teurs across America to be stuffed and conventional-
ized for the "mainstream underground."
While chip-off bands like The Dodos provide for
some good, combustible freak-folk, they're a hell of a
lot less freaky than Animal Collective. The Dodos lift
the surface features of Animal Collective (the tribal
yells and frenetic, rim-clacking percussion) and
streamline them into more conventional song struc-
tures - which isn't to rip on The Dodos. It's simply
to say that technological advancements have made
it incredibly easy for anyone with sufficient passion
and drive to arrange the spare parts of their favorite
bands into serviceable but derivative pastiches.
This do-it-your-self mentality has even manifested
itself in the way we listen to music. While the art of
mix-making far outdates the On-The-Go playlist,
MP3 players have certainly stunted our dependence
on the album as a cohesive artistic statement. Back
in the age of the Walkman, there was no "shuffle." I
mean, most Walkmen came equipped with the ability
to listen to a single CD in random order - but, hon-
estly, what fun is that?
iPod nanos, with their relatively small storage
sizes, are far better suited to compiling an archive
of your personal greatest hits than stockpiling an
extensive album collection. And, with so many
people trafficking music on the Internet nowadays,
it's come down to the sheer logistical fact that songs,
with their compact file sizes, are going to enjoy way
more broadband movement than digitally bulkier

albums. We have entered the era of the single-serv-
ing song, and this cultural trend has been picked up
on and exploited by legitimate digital music super-
markets like iTunes.
This may seem like small potatoes, but when you
open up iTunes, the first chartyou're hit with is the
Top Singles chart. You have to manually scroll down
just to get to the Top Albums chart. And the store's
marketing technique of selling individual songs for
roughly twice the price of a gumball and promoting
them with 30-second preview clips has certainly
exacerbated our generation's cultural ADD. Not only
are people buying albums less, they're basing these
single-serving purchases on whether or not a micro-
ad can hook them instantly. No one is going to have
any conception for the scope and value of a 25-min-
ute jazz opus based on the hunk-of-piano-solo a
30-second preview provides. And, consequently, peo-
ple are going to be less inclined to buy iton iTunes.
What you get is the death of the album. Or, in
slightly less hyperbolic terms, the devaluing of the
album in the context of popular culture. The world
has caught rock star fever - everyone's either pining
to be the next bedroom indie darling or stir-frying
their own On-The-Go mishmashes of other artists'
work. This may all seem like a big load of apocalyptic
over-generalizing, but there's certainly been a grow-
ing streak of narcissism in music, an art form often
toted as the universal language.
Everyone's making songs,
and everyone's making
them badly. Computers
are killing music.
The "indie" genre, a faction of music typically cor-
related with artistic innovation and out-of-the-box-
ed-ness, has been busted open to the mainstream by
programs like Garage Band. Matt Bradish, owner of
local record store Underground Sounds, asserts that,
while he is a fervent supporter of local artists, he
doesn't feel inclined to sift through the landslide of
self-released music he receives.
"It's just too easy to make stuff and release it
(these days). There's a glut of releases out there that
have no place being released," he says.
French economist Jacques Attali even goes so far
as to wonder if there will ever be a point in the future
when the ability to compose music becomes so uni-
versal, and the world's musical library so vast, that
"musician" will lose its status as a viable career option
- everyone will simply be his or her own composer.
But, as terrifying as this sounds, we haven't
reached the end just yet - we still have Wavves. And
for that, we should be thankful.

"Shroud of Turin," an investiga-

ambiguous lamentation over what
could be interpreted as either a
failed relationship or spiritual
cynicism with lines like, "It never

never does what it's supposed to

Even the songs' thematic
expressions are pleated for the
mainstream, capturing love with
broad, facile lyrics like "Love /
Hate it / Want it," missing the
oddball metaphors that marked
the band's past work. It's as if The
Fountain was watered-down, with
neutrality in an attempt to appeal
to more listeners. Refusing to
break the band's routine of radio-
ready rock, the album loses the
edge that made Echo and the Bun-
nymen's previous albums worth a
listen.
While there is a certain comfort
found in consistency, it is Echo
and the Bunnymen's failure to
take risks that secures Fountain
as a passive, middle-of-the-road
album.

Flying the freak-folk flag

I am the Ghost of Christmas . oh, just pooped myself."
A 'Christmas'eer

Even CGI Jim Carrey can't save
this cold Dickens retread
By NICK COSTON
DailyArts Writer
There is a warmth within Charles Dickens's "A
Christmas Carol" that has made it a
beloved holiday story for 166 years. **
Successful adaptations of the book
have tapped into this sincerity and AChristmas
honored Dickens's original work of Caro
spiritual redemption. Unfortunate-
ly, this season's animated theatri- At Quality16
cal spin on "A Christmas Carol" is and Showcase
entirely devoid of the heart present Dsey
in other, better versions of the story.
As a result, its wildly impressive
CGIvisuals and aspirited digitalperformance fromJim
Carrey are powerless to accentuate the narrative.
This version of "Carol" does not diverge from its
traditional plotline. Mean old Ebenezer Scrooge is
haunted by three ghosts of Christmas, who lead him
on a journey through time and space to educate the
covetous old sinner of the Christmas spirit he has sum-
marily humbugged for so many years. Those ghosts,
along with the central role of Scrooge, are the tireless
work of actor Jim Carrey, who portrays all his char-
acters on-screen through the magic of motion-capture
technology. Though Carrey's Scrooge is appropriately
grumpy, his constant screaming in fear of the ghosts'
roller-coaster actions grow rapidly thin.
Carrey's ghosts, meanwhile, introduce a new but
woefully vague twist to the story. Traditionally, a dif-
ferent actor plays each of the three ghosts. If director
Robert Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump") is trying to sug-
gest the ghosts are a manifestation of Scrooge's mind,
or that the true meaning of Christmas has lived inside
of Scrooge all along, Zemeckis needed to take more
action than a mere pre-production casting decision.
Instead, he places Carrey in all four roles, ostensi-
bly for the actor's physical comedy, but doesn't employ
that decision thematically. Each ghost bears an obvi-

ous resemblance to Scrooge, yet the characters address
each other completely ignorant to their similarities.
The audience is left wondering what conclusions are
meant to be drawn from Carrey's quadruple role.
Zemeckis has made emotionally charged films
before; he's clearly capable of delivering a challeng-
ing and heartfelt story, and Dickens's tale of redis-
covering love and familial attachment lends itself to
such a film. But Zemeckis's film is depressingly cold.
It insists upon a bombardment of dazzling visual
spectacles in place of showing the gradual change in
Scrooge's emotional state.
Those visuals are so finely crafted and detailed that
the viewer can't help but acquire unrealistic expecta-
tions for an emotional output from the digital charac-
ters - one that's simply not technologically possible
within the boundaries of the CGI presentation. "A
Christmas Carol" is a dance in premature celebra-
tion of realism, as if Pinocchio never actually became
human but obliviously laughed and cheered as though
he had, and the result is altogether uncomfortable to
watch. We see individual little hairs sprouting out
of the pores on Scrooge's beaky nose, yet his cartoon
eyes are eerily dead even as his heart is supposed to be
breaking for the fate of Tiny Tim. That the audience
cannot discern change in Scrooge's heart is a fatal flaw.
That's not to say the visuals aren't impressive on a
purely aesthetic level. Scrooge's flight though moon-
lit London is spectacular, despite his continuous and
tiresome shrieking. The character animations are
liquid smooth, apart from those of Scrooge, whose
age precludes him from moving with much grace.
And Gary Oldman's brief turn as the remorseful
specter of Scrooge's former partner Jacob Marley is
genuinely spooky.
Robert Zemeckis has proven in the past that he can
compose a film driven by heart. A successful adapta-
tion of Charles Dickens's "A Christmas Carol" requires
such an emotional investment, but sadly, the creepy and
lifeless characters in Zemeckis's version simply don't
achieve the level of sincerity that preceding versions of
the story have. Don't be surprised if you see "A Christ-
mas Carol: The Ride" opening at Disney World some-
time soon.

becomes more relatable to a

the age-old question of whether
women should put careers over

As with any fashion-centric
film, the clothes (designed by
Catherine Leterrier) are striking,
but not striking in the traditional
"Chanel" way. The movie is more
focused on creating a contrast
between Chanel's fondness for
simplicity and the flamboyant

future. As a result, modest-yet-
chic outfits dominate the screen.
The only sort of creativity mani-
fested takes the form of Chanel's
penchant for cutting apart men's
outfits to create a jaunty sort of
menswear, a far cry: from the
trademark clean-cut jackets and
little black dresses that Chanel's
empire is famous for.
Those who come into the film
solely for the renowned Chanel
designs, though, will be left wait-
ing until the end. The finale fea-
tures Chanel's first fashion show,
displaying models in a stream
of dresses cascading down the
stairs. For the first time, Chanel's
personality and personal life
have fused into a palette of fab-
rics and colors, all still contain-

ing her trademark elegance and
simplicity. It's as if the movie is
trying to say that true fashion is
ultimately reached with a com-
plete awareness of yourself. Only
until Chanel has liberated herself
from marriage expectations and
her societal aspirations can she
produce something brilliant.
"Coco Before Chanel" prob-
ably won't be the fashion confec-
tion audiences might expect, but
it's a nice alternative for those
who find period films too stuffy
or slow. More character sketch
than period love story, "Cha-
nel" is a film that marches deci-
sively past biopic conventions to
explore the fascinating woman
behind the brand - absent fash-
ion, absent men.

Students: AAPD lost evidence

From Page 1A
when interviewed by a Daily
reporter last night, stating that he
was unaware one had been turned
over to police or which police offi-
cer would have taken it.
Ward said he believes the
AAPD has "made a mess" of the
incident.
"I don't know what other steps
the police took that night, but if
the memory card is indicative of
anything, I don't think they went
very far with it," Ward said.
Lance said he was unable to
confirm if AAPD is currently
" investigating the Oct. 31 inci-
dent, indicating that investiga-
tion of any incident is the victim's
choice.
"It's up to the victim to pur-
sue the case if they want to press
charges," Lance said. "If they

don't call to follow up, the case
pretty much gets put down."
Bartonsaid he and Wardviewed
the video before handing the
memory card in and that it showed
a good account of what happened
once the violence began.
Barton said that some of the
pictures he took showed college-
aged men jumping on the back of
the car the victim was driving just
prior to the incident, which he
believes may have been helpful in
identifying the attackers.
The amount of people in the
road forced the car to stop, Ward
said. Once the people in front
of the vehicle moved, the driver
accelerated and one of the men on
the back of the car fell.
"That's when they started to
throw things at the car and hit it,
trying to open the doors," Ward
said. "(The driver) couldn't go

anywhere."
According to Ward, the driver
then likely put the car in park,
exited the vehicle and was imme-
diately pushed to the ground. He
said between eight and 15 young
men were participating in the
attack when he and others stepped
in to stop the beating.
Other eyewitnesses who
described the incident to the Daily
estimated the number of attackers
from as few as five to as many as
30.
"I was trying to stop it. Some
girls that were there tried to stop
it as well," Ward said. "I don't
think (the girls) knew the guys
who were beating him up."
Eventually, the violence
stopped and the victim was car-
ried to a nearby porch, where he
remained until police arrived at
the scene.

TRANSPORTATION
From Page 1A
the FullerRoadstructure.
Anglin confirmed that city offi-
cials considered the Hospital's park-
ing shortage as they mapped out the
transit station.
"The University definitely needs
the parking in that section," Anglin
said. "The structure will relieve that
parking burden."
In addition to providing hospital
parking, the transit station is also part
of an ambitious plan to both establish
a local commuter rail service and to
link differentforms of transportation
through what Councilmember Ste-
phen Rapundalo (D-Ward 2) called
"an intermodal center, bringing
together trains, cars, buses and inte-
grating cycling and pedestrians."
The ultimate goal, Rapundalo
said, is to reduce to number of cars
entering and leaving the city, as well
as those within the city itself.
Anglin said the transit center, with
its proximity to the Amtrak rail, will
help lay the foundation for a transpor-
tation hub by providing parking, bike

storage and busing for commuters.
"This center has the infrastruc-
ture potential for further develop-
ment," Anglin said.
Those potential developments
include establishing East-West and
North-South commuter trains to
accommodate the roughly 75,000
commuters who come into town
every day, Rapundalo said.
"We're definitelylooking at a much
broader transportation network (than
currently exists)," Rapundalo said.
BothRapundaloandAnglinpointed
out that these changes can't take place
without comprehensive community-
wide budget conversations.
"Ihopethatwecanmove forward,
but in this economy it's hard to tell,"
Anglin said.
The transit station is the first phase
in the city's broader plan to both
decrease traffic congestion in the
city and make Ann Arbor a more vis-
ible transportation hub. According to
Anglin, even high-speed rails aren't
completelyout of the question.
"At this point I think that's just a
pipe dream," he said. "But it certain-
ly could move in that direction if all
the pieces came together."

LAWSUIT
From Page 1A
another professor's lab to detect
radiation, the article reported.
The lab contained Cesium 137 -
a highly radioactive material -
but Hartman claimed he didn't
know if the Cesium was active.
McGee sent an e-mail to the
University's Radiation Safety
Service on Feb. 16, 2008 to report
his exposure to the radiation. He
also informed the University's
Department of Occupational
Safety and Environmental Health
that he witnessed Hartman dis-
posingchemicals ina sink McGee
thought led to a storm drain.
University spokeswoman
Kelly Cunningham wrote in an
e-mail interview that the alleged
safety violations were not true.
"Mr. McGee could not have
been exposed to radiation as the
machine in question was locked
and inactive at the time he and
Prof. Hartman were in the area,"
she wrote.
She added that an Occupa-

tional Safety and Environmental
Health investigation determined
the chemical waste Hartman
allegedly dumped in a sink was
properly disposed.
Though McGee claims he was
fired for reporting safety viola-
tions, Cunningham says that is
not the case.
Cunningham wrote that the
project McGee worked on was
completed before the end of his
appointment, and the depart-
ment decided not to reappoint
him for another term even before
the incident occurred.
"This decision was made long
before Mr. McGee raised any
concerns," she wrote.
McGee received full pay and
benefits until the end of his term.
However, the annarbor.com arti-
cle states he was denied employ-
ment with another professor
after he was terminated.
When reached last night,
McGee said he wouldn't com-
ment on the case until later this
week.
Hartman could not be reached
Sunday evening.

ics, which is uncommon among
other universities.
"We are very fortunate here
that the presidents have been able
to sort of be in charge, and we've
had good administration and a
good athletic director who has put
us in an extremely good financial
position," she said.
Despite Coleman's optimism,
many university presidents who
responded in the report ques-
tioned how long they could sustain
their current athletic operations
given escalating athletic expenses.
Roughly half of the respondents
said their current athletic models
will impact the number of varsity
sports they will be able to main-
tain in future years.
Coleman said the University has
been "very conscious" about the
need to create sustainable athletic
operations.
She cited the work of Athletic
Director Bill Martin, who focused
on athletic sustainability issues

during his nine years as director.
In the 1999 fiscal year, the Ath-
letic Department suffered a $2.8
million deficit. According to docu-
ments from a University Board
of Regents meeting in 2008, the
department was projected to run
a $10.3 million surplus during the
last fiscal year.
Martin recently announced that
he will retire next September, and
Coleman said she is searching for a
new athletic director who will also
make fiscal stability a priority.
"One of the issues that I will
be looking for in the next athletic
director is somebody who can
articulate the ways in which to
keep what we do at Michigan sus-
tainable," she said.
In the report, many university
presidents cited the hardships asso-
ciated with mounting athletic costs.
Three-fourths of the presidents
interviewed for the study said that
athletics present a unique prob-
lem in controlling costs compared
to other schools, departments and
units at their universities.
At the University of Michigan,
costs appear to be similarly on the
rise. But unlike most other uni-
versities, the University of Mich-
igan's budget has been running
at a surplus of late.
Bill Martin and Jason Win-
ters, chief financial officer for
the Athletic Department, esti-
mated athletic revenue would
increase this year to about $94
million and expenditures would
be roughly $85.6 million, accord-
ing to documents prepared for a
June regents meeting.
Those numbers are both up
from the year before, when Mar-
tin and Winters budgeted rev-
enue from University athletics
to be about $90.5 million and
operating expenses about $80.2
million.
Factors affecting costs includ-
ed the rising salaries of coaches
and the number of coaches and
athletic personnel, according to
the report.
Eighty-five percent of presi-
dents responded in the interview
that they thought salaries for
football and basketball coaches
were too high and that salaries
are the "greatest impediment" to
athletic sustainability.
However, more than half the
presidents indicated they feel
they have no power to reduce
coach's salaries because of the
amount of private support that
funds those salaries.
About two-thirds of presi-
dents replied that policy changes
should be studied in an effort to
cut down on the number of ath-
letic personnel and coaches of
revenue-producing sports. More
than half expressed a desire to
decrease the number of coaches
of non-revenue sports.
Presidents also identified the
pressure to renovate and build
new athletic facilities as a factor
that impacts athletic spending.
University of Michigan Ath-
letic Department has spent heav-
ily on its facilities duringthe past
few years as well. Renovations to
the Big House are expected to
cost $226 million. Other major
athletic construction projects
include the $26.1 million Al Glick
Field House for football practice
and the new basketball practice

facility, which is estimated to
cost $23 million.
Despite these large price tags,
Coleman said the University is
responsible about its athletic
expenditures.
"Even though we have a lot of
construction and renovation going
on in athletics, I don't feel like it's
irresponsible," she said. "We've
met all of our budget targets."
While financing new con-
struction projects can be a
challenge in an economic reces-
sion, 62 percent of presidents
surveyed said the effect of the
economic downturn on athletic
budgets mirrored the effect on
other divisions of their institu-
tion. Reasons for this included
proportional cuts in athletic and
academic spending and a loss in
both public and private funding
to all units of universities.
Almost all the presidents
agreed that they felt confident
the financial information they
received from their athletic
departments was accurate. But
eight out of 10 presidents said
there needed to be greater trans-
parency in athletic operating and
capital costs.
One anonymous president
said in the report that transpar-
ency would help solve budget
problems.
"If our public is fully aware
of the money and other issues, it
will support proper values," the
president said.
Regardless of all the challeng-
es associated with maintaining
high-cost athletic departments,
the majority of presidents
believed athletics benefited their
universities by increasing the
number of applicants, generat-
ing more donations and raising
school spirit.

All of the Michigan football
team's issues and concerns from
the last month seemingly vanished
right in front of the Big House
crowd shortly after the start of Sat-
urday's game.
Freshman quarterback Tate
Forcier, who hadn't thrown a
touchdown pass in more than a
month, threw a 43-yard strike to
slot receiver Roy Roundtree and
racked up 139 yards in the first two
quarters.
Senior Brandon Minor, after bat-
tling a pesky ankle injury all sea-
son, had already notched his first
100-yard performance since the
Notre Dame game, and he got it
before the break.
The defense broke its month-
long turnover-less streak, inter-
cepting two Joey Elliott passes
before halftime.
And the Wolverines finally
pounced on a apparently lesser
opponent, cracking open a 24-10

* Blue clinches No. 7 seed
in conference tourney
_with loss at Ohio State

RedHawks sweep Michigan at Yost

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Writer
The Wolverines' plan needed
to be revised.
After almost 45 minutes, it
looked like the Michigan men's
soccer team would head into half-
time following an evenly played
opening stanza at Ohio State with
the teams tied 0-0.
But with just two seconds left
in the first half, the Buckeyes
changed everything.
Michigan freshman Noble Sul-
livan cleared an Ohio State corner
kick out of the box, but the ball
unluckily found the feet of open
Buckeye Chris Gomez on the far
side of the field. He sent the ball to
David Tiemstra, who fired a shot
from seven yards that ricocheted

off the underside of the crossbar
and to the back of the net.
"As a coaching staff, you kind
of have your plans formulated for
what you need to do differently
in the second half and then sud-
denly ... we have a quick amount
of time to reconfigure the plan for
the second half," Michigan coach
Steve Burns said.
The tally was the difference in
a game that decided much more
than a 'W' or a 'L.' The Buckeyes'
1-0 win gave them their first Big

could have placed them as low as

Why Igot booted from Yost

Yost Ice Arena is home to
my favorite student section
on campus.
It doesn't have disinterested
sorority girls engrossed in a BBM
conversation with their sisters at
the end of the
row, like at
Michigan Sta-
dium.
It doesn't
have spotty fans
who stereotypi-
cally only get
excited for the ANDY
Duke, Michigan REID
State and Ohio
State games,
like at Crisler Arena.
And - on top of all that - it's
rowdy as all hell.
But on Saturday night, my expe-
rience at Yost was not at all what I
would call fun. I was at the game
for about 10 minutes, when after
Miami (Ohio)'s first penalty, I par-
ticipated in what has come to be
known as the 'C-Ya' chant.
For those of you who have never
been to a hockey game at Yost, it goes
like this: "Ahhhhh, C-Ya - chump,
dick, wuss, douchebag, asshole, prick,
cheater,bitch, whore, slut, cock-
sucker." Racy?Yes. But it's nothing
comparedto Maryland basketball
fans chanting "Fucked your sister" to
former Duke star J.J. Redick, whose
sibling went to Maryland.
Like usual, I said the same chant
tons of times Friday night with
thousands of other fans and noth-
ing happened.
Saturday night, I got kicked out.
Not cool, dude.

Amidst an entire student sec-
tion doing the same thing, an usher
grabbed my elbow and told meit
was time to leave, unless I wanted
to be led out of the stadium in
handcuffs.
I will admit that I stood out from
the other Children of Yost. I may
or may not have had a megaphone.
And I may or may not have been,
ahem, dressed up - if you went to
the game, you might have seen a
six-foot chicken standing against
the glass in section 18.
But that's even more reason to
not kick me out. How is the team
supposed to focus and be motivated
without a yellow, fuzzy chicken
standing behind the glass? The
Wolverines lost 5-1, by the way.
So I walked home all by myself,
a very, very sad chicken. Now I
can empathize with you BBM-mad
sorority girls - a walk of shame is
a really embarrassingthing. Ijust
assured myself everyone would
think the weirdo in the chicken
outfit would be a member of the
Residential College and tried to get
home as quickly as possible.
To top it off, my parents, who
were in town for the football game,
just happened to drive by Yost at
the exact same time I was argu-
ing with a DPS officer outside. Ina
chicken suit. With a megaphone.
"That U in a chicken suit w/cops?
LOL" isn't a text message you can get
from a member of your family and
still maintain anybshred of dignity.
I was just trying to have fun
and enjoy a hockey game, but the
usher assured me that my wardrobe
played a major role in his singling

me out amid 4,000 people who all
used the same exact word that I
did. Though none of the other ush-
ers seemed to be following his lead,
he went on to kick out five more
people - and none of them were
dressed as chickens - including
one who stepped into the aisle in
front of him when he tried to enter
the section to find another person
to throw out.
First off, I know the main prob-
lem with the chant is the homopho-
bic slur "cocksucker." To all those
who are offended by it - I agree
with you. It has no place at Michi-
gan, and if you, asa hockey fan,
aren't already happy with shout-
ing douchebag, slut and asshole
at opposing players, the least you
could do is be a little more creative
than a Michigan State frat boy.
As I type this, I realize that I
said the word anyway. I probably
shouldn't have, but I did, and I
got caught up in the spirit of Yost
Arena. I would like to see that word
eliminated, too, but this isa dif-
ferent, more explosive issue. Right
now, I just want to talk about how
the ushers and the Michigan Ath-
letic Department have decided to
try and "fix" the problem.
I think it's completely imma-
ture and inappropriate for them to
single people out in this situation. If
I would have used the megaphone
to yell swear words and hateful
speech at the other - well, I called
RedHawk coach Enrico Blasi a
midget once, but that's not worthy
of expulsion, is it? - that would
have been one thing.
I didn't. I participated in a tradi-

tional Michigan hockey chant, one
that the Athletic Department has
sat and watched get increasingly
more obscene for the last 15 years -
and "cocksucker" has been around
for at least four of those, from my
experiences on campus.
They knew this was happening.
They knew students were adding
more words to it. And you did noth-
ing, other than try to have the band
play over it.
This is not the way to handle the
problem. Singling out students is
not the answer.
Have Michigan coach Red
Berenson address the section
before the game over the loud-
speaker, either live or pre-taped.
Or at the very least, do something
to inform us that you have decided
to crack down on the chant. Post
signs, make an announcement, send
an e-mail out to the students who
bought tickets. Something.
Kicking out six students isn't
going to solve anything. And if you
think the language was offensive
this week, just wait until Michi-
gan State comes to Ann Arbor this
weekend for the first time since
Steve Kampfer was maliciously
attacked by two Sparties last year.
You can't kick everyone out at
once, I know that - but there are
more preemptive ways to address
the problem than having crotchety,
rude old men picking on specific
students.
- Reid will be donning the
chicken suit again. Maybe the
megaphone is a bit much. He can be
reached at andyreid@umich.edu.

Wolverines easily cruise in exhibition win over WSU

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's basketball
team's 73-54 exhibition win on Fri-
day against Wayne State technically
didn't count.
Somebody forgot to tell Manny
Harris.
The preseason All-Big Ten first-
team selection cruised to 25 points,
five rebounds, four assists and three
steals, exactly the kind of all-around
performance Michigan fans have
come to expect.
The nagging hamstring injury

didn't keep him off the court - he
played a team-high 29 minutes.
"It was my first test in a minute,
because in the Eastern Michigan
(scrimmage) it was still sore," Har-
ris said. "It got a lotbetter."
Though Harris filled out the stat
sheet nicely, it was his presence that
impressed Michigan coach John
Beilein.
"His demeanor the whole game
was so positive," Beilein said. "He
showed great leadership skills
today."
Sophomore Zack Novak fol-
lowed up on last year's success from

beyond the arc, scoring 15 points on
just eight shots, all 3-pointers.
The game also gave fans their
first look at highly touted freshman
guard Darius Morris.
Morris started the game and
played 25 minutes, tallying four
points, three assists and three
rebounds in his first collegiate
contest. The lanky guard was
a presence on the perimeter
defense, hassling the smaller War-
rior guards.
"I like playing at the top (of the
zone), I'm still learning, learning on
the job," Morris said. "I like getting

a chance to get some deflections."
Though Morris said he wasn't
nervous once the game started, he
did have a freshman moment after
he scored his first points.
"I was really excited, like, 'Man,
that's my first college bucket right
there,' " he said. "But then I remem-
bered, 'Oh, we're in three zone.' At
first I was lost, but it was a great
experience."
Redshirt freshman Ben Cronin,
who Beilein described as "70 percent
to where we want him to be," played
just three minutes, scoring four
points and snaggingthree boards.

By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Daily SportsEditor
Purdue cornerback Brandon
King saw something critical in the
Michigan offense that made him
confident:
Confusion.
But it didn't show up until after
halftime.
In the first half, freshman quar-
terback Tate Forcier led Michigan
to a two-touchdown lead. The
offense looked unstoppable.
"They played
a lot of man (cov- NOTEBOOK
erage) in the first
half, and it showed," Forcier said
after the game. "We saw it, and we
picked it apart."
It showed especially when
Forcier found redshirt fresh-
man Roy Roundtree for a 43-yard
touchdown pass in the second
quarter. Purdue was playing zero
coverage in order to stop Michi-
gan's prolific run game, which left
sixth-year safety Torri Williams
vulnerable.
But once Roundtree beat Wil-
liams, the Boilermakers knew they
had to change their game plan to
have a chance.
After the break, Purdue played
much more zone coverage, which
threw off the Wolverines.
"We hadn't done that all sea-
son," Boilermaker cornerback
Brandon King said. "And so when
we changed the defense up, it kind
of startled them as a team.
"We changed a couple defen-
sive schemes, we changed a couple
calls up, and it worked to perfec-
tion."
After 24 points in the first half,
Michigan scored just 12 in the sec-
ond.
"They stuck with their game
plan - we adjusted ours," Purdue
senior cornerback David Pender
said. "I don't think that they were
ready for us to come out (like
that)."
QUESTIONABLE HANDSHAKE:
When Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez went to shake Purdue

coach Danny Hope's hand after
the game, Hope brought a strange
guest: fifth-year senior offensive
lineman Zach Reckman.
"(Hope) came over and shook my
hand, and then introduced me to
Reckman and said, 'Thanks, Coach,
I really appreciate what you did.'
Whatever." Rodriguez said.
Wait a second. What did Rodri-
guez do?
When the Big Ten suspended
Michigan linebacker Jonas Mou-
ton for throwing a punch at a
Notre Dame player on Sept. 12,
Rodriguez said he hoped the con-
ference would be consistent in its
criteria for suspensions.
A week later, Reckman threw
what was reported as a jab against
Northern Illinois. When Rodriguez
was asked the nextMonday whathe
thought of Reckman's questionable
action, he said "it probably" was "a
non-football act."
And then, just like with Mou-
ton, the Big Ten made Reckman
sit out a game. It's pretty clear who
Purdue blames for the fifth-year
senior's suspension.
"Their coach brought him over
like I was the reason his lineman
got suspended for that one game,"
Rodriguezsaid."Idon'tknowwhere
that came from. I talked to (Hope)
on the phone and said that wasn't
me and this was way back when. I
didn't have anythingto do with that
young man getting suspended.
"To come over and say some-
thing about that - whatever."
The Momentum Swing: After
Purdue got within six points in the
third quarter, the opportunity was
ripe for a comeback.
The Boilermakers lined up in
their normal kickoff formation but
caught Michigan off guard and
executed a perfect onside kick.
The Wolverine coverage team had
already turned away from the ball
for their regular blocking assign-
ments, allowing Purdue to easily
recover the ball.
"I never felt like it was going to
work (in practice)," said Pender,
who recovered the kick. "But it

By COURTNEY RATKOWIAK
Daily Sports Editor
The last time a Michigan
receiver and running back both
posted over 100 yards, the Wol-
verines were on top of the world.
They upset Heisman Trophy win-
ner Tim Tebow and Florida 41-35
in the 2008 Capital One Bowl,
making up for a four-loss season
by playing with swagger against
the heavily favored Southeastern
Conference team. Lloyd Carr's
team carried him off the field in
celebration after his final game as
the Wolverines' coach.
On Saturday, with one more
winstill.neededtoevenbe eligible
for a bowl, Michigan matched
that 100-yard feat early in the
game against Purdue. But while
then-senior wide receiver Adrian
Arrington and then-senior run-
ning back Mike Hart steadily led
their team to a win in Orlando,
redshirt freshman Roy Roundtree
and senior running back Brandon
Minor mustered just 23 and 47
yards after halftime, respectively,
en route to yet another third-
quarter Michigan collapse.
The individual players' sto-
ries were comparable, even if the
game results were drastically dif-
ferent. In the Capital One Bowl,
Hart was truly healthy for the first
time since the middle of the sea-
son, where he missed three games
and was limited in two more after
suffering a high ankle sprain. He
predictably played well, running
for 129 yards.
Last week, Minor practiced the
most he had in a month, meaning
he was primed to be as healthy
as he could Saturday with what
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
has called a chronic ankle injury.
LINCOLN
From page 1B
struggles and who postponed enter-
ing the NFL draft to stay an extra
season, you want to hope there's
something thatcan be salvaged.
"Just all the goals we had this
year go down the drain a little bit,"
Graham said, describing what has
made him upset about this season.
"We just trying to get to a bowl
now. That's a big goal. I'll really
cry if we don't."
With a road game against Wis-
consin and Ohio State at home
remaining on the schedule, the
chances Graham's eyes wells up
after Nov. 21 are pretty high.
One ofthe Big Ten's quietest sur-
prises this season, the 20th-ranked
Badgers have elevated themselves

His health showed as he racked up
154 yards on 19 carries.
"Westruggledtoshutdowntheir
one-back running attack," Purdue
coach Danny Hope said. "Number
four, Minor, is an outstanding play-
er. I think he's one of the best run-
ningbacks in the nation.
"We knew him coming into the
game, he's going to be a difference
maker in the game, and he cer-
tainly was. He's a great player."
And Arrington, in the Capital
One Bowl, and Roundtree, against
Purdue, both posted career-high
numbers. The bowl game was
Arrington's 28th and final game
in a Michigan uniform - the
receiver bolted for the NFL after
Carr retired - and he posted a
personal record 153 yards and two
touchdowns.
Roundtree is in a completely
different point in his Michigan
career than Arrington was in
2008. The redshirt freshman
played in just his fourth career
game Saturday and made his sec-
qnd start, filling in for an injured
Martavious Odoms. Roundtree
made the most of his chance,
equaling his cumulative career
receptions (six) in the firstquarter
alone and finishing with 10 catch-
es for 126 yards.
On the Wolverines' first
drive, with the team down 7-0,
Roundtree snatched the ball from
a Purdue defender and made a
26-yard leaping catch to convert
on a third-and-15. That play set up
Minor's touchdown run.
"He's got great ball skills,"
Rodriguez said. "He's going to
keep getting better because he's a
thin guy playing for the first time.
Once he gains some strength, as
he matures and gets older, he's
going to be a very, very good play-
behind a solid rushing offense and
an impressive (±5) turnover margin.
And considering Wisconsin is 5-1in
Camp Randall Stadium this season,
it's not likely the Wolverines come
out with a win there.
Should Michigan earn its sixth
win against Ohio State, it couldn't
be a more poetic ending. End a
five-season losing streak against
its most hated rival, qualify for
a bowl and deny the Buckeyes a
potential Rose Bowl berth?
Especially for Graham, his
freshman year game against
Ohio State meant more than just
another chapter in the rivalry. It's
hard to forget the No.1 vs. No. 2
matchup that seemed like just the
beginning. But a lot has changed
in three years.
There's a reason Ohio State

er for us, I think."
Minor's maturity and speed
was on full display early. The
senior started the game with a
gritty 29-yard touchdown run
where he broke multiple tackles,
stiff-armed a Purdue defender
and dove into the end zone to tie
the game at seven. His 55-yard
touchdown run on the first play
of the second quarter was the
longest of his career and gave the
Wolverines a 17-10 lead.
But he looked like he re-aggra-
vated the injury during the fourth
quarter, where he was pulled
down by his ankle after a run
and limped off the field. Furious,
Minor threw his helmet while
standing on the sideline. He came
back in the game a few plays later.
"I wish we could've pulled it
out for him," freshman quarter-
back Tate Forcier said. "Just the
way he plays, and him playing
hurt, it almost sends a message to
everybody else - if you're hurt,
just deal with it."
It only took eight games into
Carr's Wolverine coaching career
for a receiver and running back
to surpass 110 yards in the same
game (a 52-17 win over Minnesota
in 1995). Rodriguez, a proclaimed
offensive guru, had to wait 22
games for someone from both the
air and ground game to similarly
stand out.
But the fact that the defense
couldn't protect a 14-point lead
to win a bowl-clinching game
basically nullified Minor's near-
healthy play and Roundtree's
breakout performance. The 100-
yard achievement was a poor con-
solation prize - but in another
disappointing season, the Wolver-
ines may have to take what they
can get.
might play for the Rose Bowl and
Michigan is playing just to make
one. With the Wolverines' 2009
season already unraveling, not
much would sound better than to
win in two weeks. For that to hap-
pen, it'll take a different breed of
Wolverine than anyone has seen
these last six weeks.
Astthings stand,it's shapingup to
be a teary holiday season for many.
It's admirable Graham is saying
the Wolverines will keep fighting
week to week, but it's getting hard
to face what now seems like real-
ity. It would be a shame, but it looks
like come holiday season, Graham
will be singing "The Tracks of My
Tears" instead of "The Victors."

BOILERMAKERS
From page 1B
take a little longer to fix than any-
body wants, but we're gonna fix
them. Just give us time. It's not
going to happen right now. ... I wish
it would."
Purdue (3-3, 4-6) was aggres-
sive in the third quarter, deflect-
ing a Foraer pitch-out, executing
an onside kick, throwing a 54-yard
bomb and scoring three touch-
downs to erase Michigan's two-
score lead.
Once again, the defense was the
center of Michigan's woes, giving
up almost 500 yards of total offense
- more than 100 yards above Pur-
due's average output this season.
And the negative attention is defi-
nitely getting to the Wolverines.
When asked for a comment by
members of the media after the
loss, defensive coordinator Greg
Robinson said, "Not today," and
briskly walked toward Schem-
bechler Hall.
Robinson and junior corner-
back Donovan Warren reportedly
shared strong words on the side-

line during the game's waning
moments.
Defensive line coach Bruce Tall,
whose squad has been the lone
bright spot of the struggling unit,
also declined comment.
"I don't know what's going on,"
junior cornerback Troy Woolfolk
said. "Everybody's just clueless.
We're trying out there. We still go
back every Monday and study. But
game day, we just seem to forget
stuff. I'm not sure what it is. We're
gonna get it fixed."
With games at Wisconsin and
home against Ohio State left, Mich-
igan's bowl hopes - even a spot in
the less-than-illustrious Little Cae-
sars Pizza Bowl - are dwindling.
But the team isn't going to give
up its postseason dreams.
"You're right there, and you
see it, and it's in your sights and
it's slipping away from you every
game," left guard Steve Schilling
said when asked about still being
just one win away from bowl eligi-
bility. "We're going to keep fight-
ing. We've got too much heart. And
I'm pretty confident in our team
and that we'll be able to get to a
bowl."

THE QUICK BREAKDOWN
M A IZE GAU GE The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Mesk-o-Meter measures the success of special teams, the Rod-o-Meter

MESK-O-METER
1/4 Mesko and Stonum had great games, but it didn't matter.
Saturday's biggest plays were Michigan's miscues. Ole-
Zolt ans snavage missed an extra point and field goal, and Michigan
misplayed an onside kick. Each directly altered the outcome.

ROD-O-METER
3 By now, you've probably heard Rodriguez wasn't exactly.

4 unprovoked, the coach called out the lineman for his
snarky postgame remarks. It's tough tolose three straight.

when Michigan has a shot to clinch a bowl and a chunk of the
student section didn't even see the Wolverines'first touch-

LOOKING GOOD

FEELING BLUE

THE CLAWWWWWWWWWWW!
Former Daily Sports Editor Naweed Sikora lost his battle with testic-
ular cancer in mid-October, and a memorial service was held in his
honor in Ann Arbor this weekend. He was just 27 years old.
When he worked for Daily Sports, Sikora led a campaign to change
Michigan fans' post-defensive stand cheer from a Florida State-like
Tomahawk Chop to what he deemed The Claw, invoking the feroc-
ity of a Wolverine. This was the trend for a while, but students have
reverted back to the Chop.
Against Ohio State, try the Claw. After all, the Wolverines need all the
help against the Buckeyes they can get.
THE CHOP
