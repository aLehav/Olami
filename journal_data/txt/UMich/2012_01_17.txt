While many students listen
to Michele Norris's voice on the
radio daily, yesterday they had the
opportunity to hear - and see -
the award-winning journalist and
host of National Public Radio's "All
Things Considered" in person, as
part of the University's 25th annual

participated in a number of events
hosted in honor of King, including
speakers, discussions and exhibi-
tions focused on the Symposium's
theme of developing a future gen-
eration of activists - highlight-
ing the use of social media among

Though Geddes Road is
usually filled with rush hour
traffic on 'Monday evenings,

last night it was packed
with protesters hailing from
all across Michigan, wav-
ing banners, flags and signs
reading, "Legalize democ-
racy," "Refuse to be silenced"
and "Dictator Snyder."
A crowd of about 1,000
people marched down Ged-
des to protest outside the
gated community where

lives. The rally was in oppo-
sition of Public Act 4, a law
Snyder signed last March
that allows for an emergency
financial manager to tem-
porarily replace elected city
officials and take control
under instances of bank-
ruptcy.
Many people attended
the protest, held on Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. Day, to

support the importance of
democracy, making claims
that the policy is a threat to
the democratic system.
"Dr. King marched and
gave his life for the right to

Dental School lays a foundation

90 years ago this week (Janu-
ary 15, 1922): Construction began
on an addition to the School of Den-
tistry building, located on North
University Avenue.
The addition totaled three floors
of improvements that included the
implementation of lockerrooms,
storage units and laboratories in
the basement. An amphitheater and
lecture hall were also added on the
first floor, according to The Michi-
gan Daily. The entire second floor
was reserved for operating and dis-
pensingrooms.
The Daily reported that con-
struction crews installed the
foundation as deep as 20 feet under-
ground, "in order to gain a firm bed-
ding for the construction."
70years agothis week (January

17, 1942): The University's response
to World War II was strengthened
by introducing new courses for
women, designed to meet the mili-
tary's growing demand for nurses.
"The Army and Navy alone have
indicated that they will need 10,000
additional registered nurses," the
Daily reported.
The University War Board also
instituted courses to meet the
growing demand for dietitians,
nursery workers and secretarial
professionals. The courses were
designed to demonstrate that
"American women enter this war
with a man's share of its respon-
sibilities," according to the Daily
article.
50 years ago this week (Janu-
ary 18, 1962): The University con-

gratulated 45 new Peace Corps
members as they departed from the
Michigan Union at 8:15 a.m., bound
for two years of service in Thailand,
accordingto the Daily.
Peace Corps director R. Ser-
geant Shriver, and His Excellency
Visutr Arthayukti, Ambassador of
Thailand, were both present at a
banquet commemorating the end
of a 13-week training course for the
members.
The Daily described the group's
objective as working "in coop-
eration with the Thai government
to lower incidence of malaria,
improve general health, teach Eng-
lish as a foreign language and bet-
ter instructional methods in higher
education."

Sarkozy shrugs off French
government credit downgrade !,

Finance minister
diasgrees, says
rating change is
"bad news"
MADRID (AP) - French
President Nicolas Sarkozy
bluntly declared yesterday that
a harsh downgrade by Standard
& Poor's of France's formerly
top-rung debt rating "changes
nothing" for the eurozone's No.
2 economy.
Sarkozy, in a snippy exchange
with a journalist at a Madrid
news conference, suggested
that a solid investor demand
for a French debt auction yes-
terday and a reaffirmation from
rival ratings agency Moody's of
France's triple-A sovereign debt
had offset S&P's much-publi-
cized downgrade.

Ship supplies diesel
and gasoline to
town's ailing supply
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -
Crews began transferring 1.3 mil-
lion gallons of fuel yesterday from
a Russian fuel tanker to the iced-
in western Alaska city of Nome.
The offloading began near
sundown, said Stacey Smith of
Vitus Marine, the fuel supplier
that arranged to have the Rus-
sian tanker Renda and its crew
deliver the gasoline and diesel
fuel. The process began after
crews safety-tested two transfer
hoses with pressurized air.
Earlier, crews laid the hoses
along a stretch of Bering Sea ice.
On yesterday, they hooked the
hoses to a pipeline that begins on
a rock causeway 550 yards from
the tanker, which is moored
about half a mile offshore, said
Jason Evans, board chairman of
the Sitnasuak Native Corp.
Sitnasuak owns the local fuel
company, Bonanza Fuel, and has
been working closely with Vitus
Marine. The pipeline leads to
storage tanks in town.
Smith said the transfer began
with one hose to see how the fuel
flowed. She expected the second
hose to begin flowing soon after.

State officials said the transfer
must start during daylight, but
can continue in darkness. Nome
has just five hours of daylight
this time of year.
The transfer could be finished
within 36 hours if everything
goes smoothly, but it could take
as long as five days.
The Renda got into position
Saturday night after a Coast
Guard icebreaker cleared a path
for it through hundreds of miles
of a slow journey stalled by thick
ice and strong ocean currents.
Before the hoses could be laid
out, the ice disturbed by the
tanker's journey had to freeze
again so workers could create
some sort of roadway.
Smith said the effort is a third
of the way into completion with
the arrival of the Renda to Nome.
Pumping the fuelfrom the tank-
er will be the second part. The
third part will be the exiting
through ice by the two ships.
"It's just been an absolutely
grand collaboration by all par-
ties involved," she said of the
work accomplished so far.
The city of 3,500 didn't get its
last pre-winter barge fuel deliv-
ery because of a massive Novem-
ber storm.
Without the Renda's deliv-
ery, Nome would run out of fuel
by March or April, long before

the next barge delivery is pos-
sible after one of the most severe
Alaska winters in decades. Snow
has piled up 10 feet or higher
against the wood-sided buildings
in Nome, a former gold rush town
that is the final stop on the 1,150-
mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
The 370-foot tanker began
its journey from Russia in mid-
December, picking up diesel fuel
in South Korea before heading
to Dutch Harbor, Alaska, where
it took on unleaded gasoline. It
arrived late last week off Nome
on Alaska's west coast more than
500 miles from Anchorage.
In total, the tanker traveled
an estimated 5,000 miles, said
Rear Adm. Thomas Ostebo, com-
mander of District Seventeen
with the Coast Guard.
Personnel will walk the entire
length of hosing every 30 min-
utes to check for leaks, Evans
said. Each segment of hose has
its own spill containment area,
and extra absorbent boom will
be on hand in case of a spill.
The Coast Guard is monitor-
ing the effort, working with state,
federal, local and tribal represen-
tatives, Chief Petty Officer Kip
Wadlow said. The fuel partici-
pants had to submit a plan to state
environmental regulators on how
they intended to get the fuel off
the Renda, he said.

Greg Walker, with the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, prepares an Aeryon Scout unmanned aerial vehicle at the Nome
causeway to gather intel for the planned fuel transfer from a Russian tanker loaded with fuel for delivery to Nome.

Coast Guard
investigates report
of body in river
The U.S. Coast Guard says it's

Lt. Justin Westmiller says the
Coast Guard sent out a helicopter
and ship after getting the report
yesterday afternoon.
The report comes five days
after a 27-year-old worker on the

Jon Huntsman
quits Republican
presidential race
Republican Jon Huntsman
has dropped out of the GOP pres-
idential race and has endorsed
Mitt Romney.
Huntsman said the former
Massachusetts governor gives
the Republican Party its best
shot at defeating President
Barack Obama in the November
general election.
After staking his candidacy
on New Hampshire, Huntsman
finished third in the primary
there last week. He faced a likely
defeat in South Carolina's prima-
ry on Saturday.
Huntsman's resume had sug-
gested he could be a major con-
tender for the GOP presidential
nomination. But the former Utah
governor and diplomat found a
poor reception for his brand of
moderate civility, which he had
hoped would draw support from
independents as well as Republi-
can moderates.

* Venezuela sends
Miami consulate
personnel home
Venezuela is withdrawing
personnel from the country's
consulate in Miami more quickly
than planned because the per-

exiles with links to terrorism,
the foreign ministry announced
yesterday.
"With the intention of pre-
serving their physical and moral
integrity, the government of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezu-
ela has decided to withdraw its
consular personnel," the foreign
ministry said in a statement.
The decision comes shortly
after President Hugo Chavez
said his government would close

the consulate in response to
Washington's expulsion of a dip-
* lomat there.
The accused exiles reject the
terrorism charges.

Funes apologizes
for massacre after
20 years of denial
El Salvador President Mauri-

of 936 civilians in an army coun-
terinsurgency operation. Funes
also commemorated the 20th
anniversary of the 1992 peace
accords that put an end to the
country's 12-year civil war.
Funes said the El Mozote mas-
sacre, named for the town where
it occurred between Dec.11 to 13,
1981, was "the biggest massacre
of civilians in the contemporary
history of Latin America." He
formally acknowledged the gov-
ernment's responsibility for the
killings.
He also asked for forgiveness
from the relatives of the estimat-
ed 12,000 people disappeared in
the conflict, which left 75,000

topics - climate action, waste
prevention, healthy environ-
ments and community aware-
ness.
The University's climate
action sector has implement-
ed programs geared toward
energy conservation, reduced
carbon and renewable energy
technologies and "alterna-
tive" University transporta-
tion options, the report states.
In order to continue devel-
oping these initatives, there
will be a renewed focus on
the mitigation of greenhouse
gas emissions, energy use
and University transportation
energy demand.
The report indicated that
energy use on campus has
decreased by 21 percent
since fiscal year 2004, which
can largely be attributed to
the involvement of Univer-
sity buildings in sustain-
able efforts, like Planet Blue
Operations. According to the
report, the Chrysler Center on
North Campus reduced ener-
gy use by 30 percent, the Insti-
tute for Social Research also
saw a 30-percent decrease and
Angell Hall had a reduction of
18 percent.
Despite these successes,
total greenhouse gas emis-
sions increased 7.5 percent
from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal
year 2011. The report attribut-
ed this change to a population
increase and greater electric-
ity needs due to construction
of University buildings during
the period.
The report added that the
Universityexpects to decrease
fuel use by 30 percent by inte-
grating biodiesel buses and
additional hybrid sedans to
complement the transporta-
tion systems' ethanol and
electric vehicles.
Sustainable efforts for
waste prevention are also
being currently being devel-
oped for the University. The
report indicated that Uni-
versity programs such as the
Student Move Out program,
which has produced more
than 140 tons of donations for
local charities, have assisted
with the green movement on
campus.
Due to these efforts, from
fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year
2011, there has been a decrease
of approximately 3 percent in
total waste production and
an approximate 4 percent
decrease in annual trash dis-
posal, according to the report.

he and the state have a criti-
cal obligation to protect the
health, safety and welfare of
its citizens and to ensure that

ing to take action."
Residents of Benton Harbor,
Pontiac, Ecorse and Flint - all
cities currently under control
of emergency managers -
spoke out at the rally about the
abuses of management in their
cities.
Alison Woods, who identi-
fied herself as a "former resi-
dent" of Benton Harbor, said
the emergency financial man-
ager law has impacted the
city's credibility.
"The voice of Benton Har-
bor is not being heard any
longer," Woods said. "City offi-
cials, city managers don't mat-
ter. It's just a lot of corruption

plans to preserve local habi-
tats and water resources while
aiding in sustainable food
"sourcing." According to the
report, the student-supported
program "Go Blue, Eat Local"
contributes to sustainabil-
ity on campus by purchasing
locally grown food for dining
hall meals.
"By purchasing locally pro-
duced food, U-M can support
Michigan's economy while
preserving prime agricultural
land," the report states. "Local
produce tends to minimize
transportation and process-
ing, and is sold sooner after
harvest maximizing fresh-
ness, flavor and nutrient
value."
The report added that the
University's efforts to pursue
healthy environment initia-
tives aided in the preserva-
tion of endangered peregrine
falcons.
"A pair of endangered per-
egrine falcons who have been
seen on campus since 2006
gave birth for the first time
after taking up residence in
a nesting box built by a local
Eagle Scout that U-M Staff
located on the roof of the Uni-
versity Hospital," the report
states.
Water conservation mea-
sures are also in place due to
increased water use in recent
years. The University's water
consumption increased by
6.2 percent during fiscal year
2010, but decreased by 7.1 per-
cent from fiscal year 2004,
according to the report.
The University uses irriga-
tion technology, including the
computerized irrigation sys-
tem Maxicom, to lessen water
consumption, which has suc-
ceeded in decreasing water
use by 22 million gallons
annually on Central and North
Campuses.
The University also aims to
collaborate with the campus
community and Ann Arbor
residents through developing
programs that promote com-
munity awareness. The report
describes efforts geared
toward increased engage-
ment, such as the Planet Blue
Ambassador Program, that
connects students, faculty and
staff in sustainability move-
ments around campus.
"Promotingthe type of soci-
etal change required to instill
sustainability related values
is an extremely challeng-
ing task," the report states.
"By providing education and
opportunity, we can initiate
a culture shift where sustain-
able choices become a way of
life and are no longer looked
upon as additional responsi-
bility or burden."
goingon whether or not people
don't see it."
Flint resident Cheryl Jor-
dan said though an emergency
manger is brought in to rem-
edy a failing government, their
complete control over the city
can lead to devastating results.
"The emergency manager
has extensive powers and can

sell public assets, whatever he
chooses," Jordan said. "... We
hope he is going to be a benev-
olent dictator, but there is no
guarantee that that will be so."
Jordan said she fears that in
losing the right to control the
government by electing lead-
ers, other civil liberties may
also be dismissed.
"We live in the land where
there is supposed to be democ-
racy, and we have none in our
city," Jordan added.
Ann Arbor resident Mar-
tin Vega also said he feared
democracy was in danger, add-
ing that he is concerned about
the possibility of the imple-
mentation of an emergency
financial manager in Detroit
and how it may impact the
city's African American com-
munity.
"It is a flagrant violation
of civil rights that disenfran-
chises a large group of people,
disproportionately African
Americans," Vega said. "If
an emergency manager is
installed in Detroit, roughly
half the African American
population in Michigan will
have lost its vote on a local
level."

Keynote speaker Michele Norris gives a talk for Martin Luther King Jr. day at Hill Auditorium yesterday.

From Page 1A
writing her book, "The Grace of
Silence: A Memoir." Throughout
the process of drafting the book,
Norris said she learned about her
African American family's activ-
ism, including actions her father,
who is a World War II veteran,
took.
"(My father and fellow black
veterans) experienced a special
kind of patriotism because they
saw themselves as America,"
Norris said. " ... They saw that
they could show America what
it could be by showing America
what they could be."
Norris added that learning
about family stories from before,
during and after the civil rights
movement taught her that activ-
ism is not just comprised of large
protests and rallies, but also
smaller-scale movements and
behaviors that often go unseen.
One of the stories Norris
shared was about her grand-
mother, who made a living by
dressing up as Aunt Jemima in
order to sell instant pancake
mix around the Midwest in the
1940s. Norris talked about how
her grandmother played a role
in advocating for black equality
by refusing to behave in offen-

sive preconceived manners of
black behavior demanded by her
bosses.
"When I think about her and
I think about activism, what
she did was a brand of activism
because when she was hired
by Aunt Jemima to go out and
do this job there were certain
expectations that she would look
a certain way, that she should
wear a uniform, but also that she
would speak a certain way," Nor-
ris said. "... But what I learned
from (local) newspaper articles
was that she took the job, she
wore the uniform, she wore the
headscarf - but she spoke like
an educated woman because she
was an educated woman."
Norris said that by observ-
ing actions taken by her father
and grandmother, she learned
that the groundwork in taking
a stand for African American
rights lays in even the most min-
ute efforts.
"Sometimes activism whis-
pers," Norris said. "Sometimes
activism is just the act of show-
rig that you can be more than
anyone expects you to be."
University President Mary
Sue Coleman also spoke at the
Keynote Memorial Lecture,
welcoming the audience before

Norris took the stage. During
her address, Coleman accepted
a replica of the Martin Luther
King, Jr. National Memorial that
was given to the University to
acknowledge its contribution in
constructing the memorial hon-
oring King in Washington, D.C.
that opened last year.
"Establishing, funding,
designing and erecting this trib-
ute was no easy task," Coleman
said. "It took years of discussion
... and dedication for it to become
the stunning ... exhibit it is."
Coleman acknowledged the
three members of the Univer-
sity community who contrib-
uted to the planning, designing
and construction of the memo-
rial - James Chaffers, a profes-
sor emeritus in the College of
Architecture and Urban Plan-
ning; University alum Ed Jack-
son Jr., who was the memorial's
executive architect; and Adjunct
Senior Lecturer Jon Lockard,
an adjunct senior lecturer in the
Department of Afroamerican
and African Studies.
"This year for the first time
ever, we as a society celebrate
Dr. King's life, knowing there is
now a glorious memorial on the
National Mall in Washington,
D.C.," Coleman said.

En ourage e-books
'U' should mandate affordable class materials
extbook costs continue to rise each year, resulting in an
increasingly expensive burden for students to carry at the
beginning of semesters because publishers can increase
prices on a whim, and textbooks are required in most classes. Uni-
versity Dean of Libraries Paul Courant has expressed interest in
beginning a new push toward e-books on campus to help lower
high book costs for students. With the option of e-books, not only
would textbook prices drop by an estimated half, but the University
would play a lead role in a digital technology transformation.

"That name,"
he slurs over a
99-cent cheese-
burger, "is stu- MELANIE

name was Mary. KRUVELIS
She lived 72
years. Mary.
Mary."
A valid point, Norm. Especially
from the likes of a clearly intoxicat-
ed fellow traveler with a mouth that
seems incapable of containing the
river of saliva within. Heres a little
airport advice from the terminally
chilled-out - say it, don't spray it, my
friend.
Norm isn't his real name, by the
way. Like all the 511" white guys
out there with wire-rimmed glasses,
untamed Dumbledore beards and
breath smelling vaguely of cabbage
- or maybe fermented Mad Dog,
I couldn't tell - who stumble over
vacant seats, gracing unassuming
women with their presence, Dave,
62, of Decatur, Ill. wanted to make
his presence known.
"Like that guy who keeps painting
over the Moaning Lisa, what is he -
Banksy? British, I think. Do you have
any gum that's not this green shit?"
No, Norm, only spearmint, but
thanks for asking. We sat across from
each other: two strangers patiently
waiting for a flight that would invari-
ably arrive late. I anticipated the
curiously angry stares from flight
attendants - after all, it was my
fault westerly winds had distracted
the pilot from being distracted by
bosoms of Southeast Asian women
eager to refill coffee on that return
flight from Dallas.
I hadn't by any means invited
Norm to sit next to me - I mean, he
smelled weird - but I suppose we
were both a little lonely. After all,

his flask was running dry and I had
already listened to all of the Tom
Petty on my iPod. Twice. And aside
from the difficulty I faced trying not
to stare at that weird mole on his
neck, it was almost enjoyable. Well,
as enjoyable as strange, old, dirty
companionship can get for a misan-
thrope.
And then he started talking.
Preaching. What had happened
to America? What's with society's
mindless infatuation with celebri-
ties? Where was the bathroom near
this gate? And what was worse - I
started to listen.
"You know there's something
wrong with this country when
babies, who haven't even done a
goddamn thing, get more panties in
a bunch than anything else in the
paper. I mean, I swear to God," he
garbled, as my face crimsoned and I
began planning my conversational
getaway. "You know that Blue Ivy
baby kept regular parents out of the
ICU? Yep, in just one day of living
that infant was so valuable that secu-
rity guards kept new parents from
seeing their babies. And I can't even
get mylandlord to get off my ass."
And so on and so forth. Norm had
a lot of issues - most related to alco-
hol -but in the hour I spent with him
in the airport terminal, it became
clear that society's insatiable appe-
tites for all things shiny and famous
drove him mad. And with his blood
alcohol content, he really shouldn't
have been driving anything.
"Everything's just so... shallow...
these days. No one gives a damn
about anyone that ain't pretty. It ain't
like how it used tobe. I mean, in the
60s..."
He paused, sinking into what
appeared to be memories of weed
and Woodstock past. Then he began
talking again, but I started picking
my teeth and zoned out for a while,
so we'll move along to the parts I did
write down.
"I mean everyone that's anyone
now got that way because they paid
their way. It's all about the money...
fame... iPhone... WiFi... the Black-

berry..."
Yeah, I don't know what that
means either.
"Everybody ain't worth noth-
ing now. Jus' think about it. Like
that skunk-haired chubby and the
Paris..." - Nicole Richie and Paris
Hilton, The Simple Life - "...and the
twins, the skinny wide-eyed noth-
ings from California..." - The Olsen
twins, maybe - "...the damn fuck
from the movies that won't shut up
about who's-it-what's-it from wher-
ever, you know"
It ain't like how

it used to be in
the 60s...

College students at public universities on
average spend more than $1,000 on text-
books annually, according to the College
Board Advocacy and Policy Center. This is
an incredible amount of money to spend on
books for classes at a time when tuition and
housing continue to make higher education
inaccessible. Courant said he believes that by
enacting a program similar to Indiana Uni-
versity's e-book program, the University will
be able to integrate e-books in the future, sig-
nificantly lowering book costs for students.
Indiana University began an e-book pilot
program in 2009, and it has been success-
ful. More than half of IU's student body now
prefers e-books to regular textbooks, and
support continues to grow as more students
and professors adopt e-books for their class-
es. Though IU requires professors to make
e-book versions of the texts available, the
University of Michigan should first imple-
ment it as an option for students and not
make it mandatory.
By implementing an optional e-book pro-
gram on campus, book prices would drop
dramatically for students. The University of
Michigan is a large university consisting of
three campuses and therefore has the buy-
ing power to influence big publishers to make
prices as low as possible, and make a major-

ity of texts accessible online. Students could
stick to traditional textbooks or move for-
ward to the cheaper e-book alternative.
The Internet is the largest educational
resource for the current generation. By work-
ing with publishers to increase web accessi-
bility, the University has the chance to play
an important role in the growing transfor-
mation of digital technology. The University
has already become an educational leader
by working with Google to create a digital
library, and it should remain a digital pioneer
by implementing an e-book program.
In addition to cutting costs and paving the
way toward a more digitally advanced educa-
tion, e-books also help save paper and resourc-
es that are used in the manufacturing of
thousands of traditional textbooks each year.
It's an obvious point - e-books are a more
environmentally friendly option for a univer-
sity that values environmental conservation.
Conventional textbook prices are at an all
time high, and the trend will continue as pub-
lishers gain market power and up the costs of
textbooks. By switchingto an e-book program
to allow students the option of digital texts,
students will be freed of a significant expense.
The University should implement an optional
e-book program as it moves toward a more
technologically advanced future.

Okay, I legitimately have no idea
who that might be.
"But it just don't make any sense.
We've got people all wrapped up in
the lives of people they'll never meet,
giving a damn about the weddings
and the shows and the I-don't-know-
what's. But let me try to get a damn
cigarette from anyone in this fucking
city and. I. Won't. Get. One. No one's
even gonna look at me."
In everyone else's defense, that
mole was horrifying. But maybe he
was onto something. The cult of the
celebrity is everywhere in America.
It's on our televisions. It's in our mov-
ies. It's in our sewers. And if we don't
stop and take a second to think about
what we're digesting, we're going
to end up with pizza-eating green
turtles crawling out of underground
conduits with stupid catchphrases
and dumb headbands that will later
be sold in Hot Topic and even later
will embarrass every last alternative
middle-schooler.
It's something to think about. But
for now, I've got a plane to catch.

The other 2012 election

As the political tension and anxiety rise
after the last week's Taiwanese presidential
election, talks emerged about the subsequent
political path the country would take after
the newly elected President Ma Ying-jeou's
installment.
President Ma returned to office to serve his
second term after defeating candidate Tsai
Ing-Wen by 6 percent, or 800,000 votes, in the
Jan. 14 election.
"U.S.-Taiwan relations have grown
increasingly close over the past three years
under my administration ... the mutual trust
between high-level officials of our two coun-
tries will continue to deepen," Ma said at the
Presidential Office a day after re-election, the
Taipei Times reported. Ma plans to further
ties with China. The majority of Taiwanese
people were in favor of such policy, yet a good
portion - represented mostly by the young-
er generation - voted for candidate Tsai
Ing-Wen in the hope of protecting Taiwan's
independent democracy.
Taiwan is an island occupied by those
defeated by the Nationalists in 1949 asa result
of the Chinese Civil War. The country was
internationally recognized, and democracy
was established as the political organization
of Taiwan. The alliance of the U.S and Taiwan
has since gradually developed from a celebrat-
ed partnership to a ticking bomb.
The result of the election in Taiwan,
however, would not diffuse or resolve the
political tension among Taiwan, the U.S and
China. Instead, it would fuel the political
pressures of the region and delay the explo-
sion of the bomb.
Without Taiwan as an ally, the U.S. would
lose the benefits of having a strong line of
defense stretching from South Korea down
to the democratic nations of Southeast Asia.
With the absence of Taiwan as an indepen-

dent democratic nation, chances are China
would use economic force to coerce the coun-
try into becoming a Chinese province.
China remains communist state, and
there isn't much evidence of democratization
occurring anytime soon. If Taiwan were to
increase trade and other forms of economic
interactions with China, the political strings
attached to these economic deals would soon
turn into total political dominance by China.
It's at the same time not in China's interests
to seize Taiwan by means of military force.
Such crude decisions would reflect extremely
badly on its reputation and severely under-
mine its recent impressive economic growth
and importance on the global stage.
With four more years of governing under
President Ma's administration, it's likely that
Taiwan would continue to move closer to
China. I'd agree, but I wouldn't actively sup-
port this movement. In order for China to gain
popularity among Taiwanese, China would
need to undergo major educational reform -
focusing more on moral and ethics.
The reason the majority of Taiwanese
decided to move closer to China stemmed
from their insecurity and loss of faith in what
Taiwan could achieve on its own. This sense
of insecurity was a result of the failed govern-
ing in Taiwan over the past several years.
The relationships between the U.S., China
and Taiwan would only become more tense
in the near future. There are no practical
solutions to the political stalemate in the
region. This isn't to say that no progress -
either political or social - would take place.
Gradually, the Chinese economic engine will
win over enough Taiwanese leaders and an
increase of ties with mainland China would
follow.

A11 through middle and high
school, English teach-
ers drill in rule after rule
regarding the
makings of a
proper essay.
Essays should
be five para-
graphs, with .
an intro, three
supporting
paragraphs and HARSHA
a conclusion. NAHATA
Essays should
have three - and
only three - main points. Thesis
sentences should clearly state these
three points, should be exactly one
sentence long and should always be
the last sentence of the introduc-
tion paragraph. Begin the introduc-
tion with a broad, general statement
to get readers interested and then
narrow down to your specific point.
Never start a sentence with "and"
or "because." Start each paragraph
with a topic sentence that describes
a point from the thesis, and end with
a conclusion sentence that reiterates
the main point of the paragraph.
Never even think about writing
essays in first or second person.
And the list of rules goes on.
With so many parameters and
restrictions, it's no wonder writ-
ing is a cause of anxiety for many
students in grade school. I've heard
many people groan at the notion of
writing essays. They claim, "Writ-
ing isn't really my thing." And why
wouldn't they groan? Sitting down
to write means being overwhelmed
with an endless amount of somehow
both vague and structured rules.
Even before kids begin to contem-
plate what to write about, they're
stressing about how long the para-
graphs are, what the three main
points are, where to put the thesis
and how to fit everything they want
to say into five paragraphs.
The other day, my 12-year-old
sister was working on an essay. She
asked for help comingup with a first
sentence. The catch? The sentence

couldn't have anything to do with
her main point, had to be broad and
general and had to be moderately
interesting to capture the reader's
attention.
Ironically, on the first day of my
first-year writing seminar at the Uni-
versity, our GSI told us to never start
a paper with a broad generalization
that couldn't be supported. None of
that "Since the beginning of time ...
" business, I was told. We were also
told that the upside-down pyramid
approach to writing was ineffective,
and instead our essays should be con-
cise and to the point, without fluff
and unsupported simplifications.
Five paragraphs? That limit wasn't
binding either. Instead, we were told
that we should write as many para-
graphs as necessary to structure a
sound argument and make our point
while providing ample evidence.
Which brings me to the most sur-
prisingrule we weretoldtobreak: the
arguments. Yes, we could have more
than the magic number of three. No,
we didn't have to miraculously fit a
summary of all our points into one
sentence. Yes, our thesis statement
could be more than one sentence
long. Shocking, I know.
We grow up learning how to write
intermsofrules and afixed structure.
While this is beneficial for beginner
writers, eventually such an approach
to writing becomes too limiting. The
worst part is, after spending the first
12-or-so years of life learningto craft
essays like this, we get to college and
are told that almost everything we've
learned is incorrect.
In essence, the transition from
high school writing to college writ-
ing forces us to unlearn all the rules
engrained in our heads. It's no won-
der that even self-proclaimed "good
writers" struggle with their first cou-
ple of papers at the University.
High school writing focuses on a
set structure with a ready-made for-
mula for what is considered a "good"
essay. In college, however, we are
taught that the formula and struc-
ture is dependent on what argument

you're trying to make. There is noset,
technical, correct way to structure a
paper. Instead essays should be writ-
ten in a way that fully develops and
supports the argument in the stron-
gest way possible.
Flexibility in
writing should
be encouraged.
Real life is much closer to the col-
lege view of writing. Writing is flex-
ible and should differ based on its
purpose and audience. There isn't
one set way to write, and teaching
young students otherwise is doing
a huge injustice. In the real world,
quality writing will be evaluated by
its ability to make a clear point in a
unique way, not by how many para-
graphs are used to make that point.
When cover letters for job applica-
tions or papers for a class are written,
people care about the voice, style and
content - not about the placement of
the thesis sentence.
Placing restrictions on writing
from an early age limits creativ-
ity and discourages students from
taking risks and exploring style. It
also teaches them to focus more on
the technicalities of structure and
format than on what's important:
actual content. The result is fluff
and writing that sidesteps the main
point but fulfills the page count or
paragraph requirement. Students
develop into redundant and wordy
writers in a world where brevity is
a virtue. If we want better-prepared
writers - and good writing is an
asset in any field - perhaps it's time
we restructure how students are
taught to write from the start.

Polanski's'Carnage'
is tense, not intense

Giving up and getting
off the 'Glee' train

Adrenaline can't
replace reality in
star-studded film
By AKSHAY SETH
Daily Arts Writer
"Carnage," a dark comedy from
Roman Polanski ("The Pianist"),
is an unfortunate depiction of
Hollywood's
take on modern
parenthood.
The stereotypi- C a
cally apathetic
fathers and the At Rave and
equally phony the State
mothers are
played to per- Sony Pictures
fection by an Classics
A-list cast, but
we leave the theater with a sense
that Polanski took his material
too seriously - like he thought
his film would hit harder than it
really did.
The movie is like a 75-minute
adrenaline rush, quickly pick-
ing up speed until it reaches a
palpable breaking point. The
context behind all the mayhem
is an awkward meeting between
two couples whose children
were recently involved in a
physical altercation that result-
ed in one of the kids losing two
teeth.
The victim's parents are the
smugly "politically correct"
Penelope (Jodie Foster, "The
Silence of the Lambs") and her
crass husband Michael (John C.
Reilly, "Step Brothers"). They
square off against workaholic,
down-to-earth Alan (Christoph
Waltz, "Inglourious Basterds")
and his weary wife Nancy (Kate
Winslet, "Titanic"). Things
begin slowly enough; both cou-
ples hesitantly agree that the
best course of action would be

to allow the two children to sort
out their differences without too
much parental involvement.
Penelope, however, takes
offense when Alan passively
calls her son a snitch for ratting
out another boy his age. This
initial spark is all that's needed,
and before long, every character
has lost any remaining sense of
restraint or dignity. First, it's
couple versus couple, then hus-
band against wife and, finally,
men against women. Eventu-
ally, everyone's drinking scotch
while hurling insults at the clos-
est person.
It's this spontaneous decom-
position of civility that Polanski
tried to capture on screen - to
somehow expose it as the B.S. it
really is. And even though most
of the exchanges among the
characters are hilariously acer-
bic and witty, we never get the
sense that they're quite plausi-
ble. Rather, it seems as if what's
happening on screen is more a
byproduct of how screwed up
the characters are. It's only nat-
ural that when you get two failed
marriages in the same claustro-
phobic room, crazy shit is going
to happen.
That sense of claustrophobia,
which Polanski is known for
using so effectively to create vol-

atility between his characters,
feels rushed and incomplete this
time around. The conversations
take place in close proximity,
and all four characters are never
more than a few feet apart from
each other. The problem is that
Polanski doesn't use the camera
to make his audience feel like
they are a part of the dialogue.
The failure to do so allows us
to remain coolly detached and
adds to the feeling that what's
happening in the movie is not a
depiction of real life.
"God of Carnage," the 2009
play from which this film is
adapted, also featured high-cal-
iber actors and superb writing.
But somehow, the chemistry
between those actors felt more
relatable, more believable.
In Polanski's adaptation, the
actors are delivering the lines
wonderfully, but it looks like
they're just spouting them for
the sake of spouting them. The
undeniable intention to harm
that we saw in the play never
surfaces behind the lines in the
movie, making Polanski's anti-
civility message seem more and
more like an oddity. In short,
yes, "Carnage" is funny and
entertaining, but it's also a dark
comedy that lacks any real con-
text for darkness.

I decide it isn't worth my time.
This TV season, "Glee" finally
got the axe.
Let's be honest, "Glee" frus-
trated me before this season even
began, but I held out hope that it
would improve. After the season
three premiere, I decided I'd had
enough of Ryan Murphy and his
show from hell (nope, I'm not
talking about "American Horror
Story"). But when this season's
Christmas episode received an
'F' from A.V. Club critic Todd
VanDerWerff (a grade I've only
seen once before ... coincidental-
ly, also for an episode of "Glee"),
I was so shocked "Glee" had
managed to further decline that
I had to go back and watch what
I'd missed. Sure enough, I was
met with the show's trademark
incoherency and idiocy.
But what kills me the most is
that "Glee" hasn't always been
this horrible. When it first began,
it was a show about a group of
misfits longing for acceptance
and a man struggling to hold
onto his youth and mend a failing
marriage. Where did it all goso
wrong?
Sure, the "misfits" of McKin-
ley High are played by an unreal-
istically beautiful cast, but I was
willingto let that slide. "Glee"
is, after all, musical theater on
television, not a realistic expos6
of high school life. The glee club
could burst out in harmonized
song and synchronized dance,
backed by a full band, all without

Romney assailed by GOP
rivals during SC primary

Rivals attempt
to slow Romney
after Huntsman
endorsement
MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP)
- Under heavy debate pres-
sure from his rivals, Republican
presidential front-runner Mitt
Romney defended his record
as a venture capitalist, insisted
he bears no responsibility for
attack ads aired by his allies
and grudgingly said last night
he might release his income tax
returns this spring.
"I have nothing in them that
suggests there's any problem
and I'm happy to do so," he said.
"I sort of feel like we're showing
a lot of exposure at this point,"
he added in an apparent refer-
ence to the campaign to come

entrance for the existing foot-
ball museum to better integrate
it with the hall. According to the
communication, the Athletic
Department will primarily fund
the project and the renovations
are projected to cost about $9
million.
Brandon and Slottow also
proposed extensive renovations
to Yost Ice Arena in a separate
communication to the regents,
also to be funded by the Ath-
letic Department. The project
- which is slated to cost $14
million - will focus on the sky
boxes overlooking the arena and
will improve existing fire safety
and suppression systems.
Specifically, the press area
will be moved to the fifth level
and the media boxes on the
fourth level will be converted
into a series of luxury boxes for
spectators. The renovation will
also allow for smoother evacua-
tion in the event of an emergen-
cy, the communication states.
The Athletic Department
estimated that the Yost proj-
ect would be completed by this

against Democratic President
Barack Obama.
Romney came under criti-
cism from the opening moments
of the debate, the first of two in
the run-up to this weekend's
first-in-the-South primary in
South Carolina. The former
Massachusetts governor won
the first two events of the cam-
paign, the Iowa caucuses and
last week's New Hampshire pri-
mary, and leads in the pre-pri-
mary polls in South Carolina.
One of his rivals, Newt Gin-
grich, has virtually conceded
that a victory for Romney in
South Carolina would assure his
nomination as Obama's Republi-
can rival in the fall, and none of
the other remaining contenders
has challenged that conclusion.
That only elevated the stakes
for last night's debate, feisty
from the outset as Gingrich,
Texas Gov. Rick Perry and for-
Hospital seeks to expand
market share in Wayne
County
In an effort to expand its
market share, the University of
Michigan Health System has
requested $39 million from the
regents for the lease of a new
facility in metro Detroit.
According to a communica-
tion to the regents from Slottow
and Ora Pescovitz, the Univer-
sity's executive vice president
for medical affairs, the proposed
funds would go toward leasing
a 100,000 square foot facility in
Northville Township for Faculty
Group Practice - a multi-spe-
cialty clinic - and Ambulatory
Care Services. The new facility
would support the existing Livo-
nia Center for Specialty Care.
Pescovitz and Slottow wrote
that the lease would last for
at least 25 years, and funding
would be drawn from the Hospi-
tals and Health Center's budget.
"As part of the University of
Michigan Health System strate-
gic plan to attract patients from
outside the local market (Liv-
ingston and Washtenaw coun-
ties), the Faculty Group Practice
and Ambulatory Care Services
have targeted the 1-275 corridor
in western Wayne County for an
expansion of services to improve
overall market share," the com-

mer Pennsylvania Sen. Rick
Santorum sought to knock
Romney off stride while gener-
ally being careful to wrap their
criticism in anti-Obama rheto-
ric.
"We need to satisfy the coun-
try that whoever we nominate
has a record that can stand up to
Barack Obama in a very effec-
tive way," said Gingrich.
The five men on stage also
sought to outdo one another in
calling for lower taxes.
Paul won that competition
handily, saying he thought the
top rate should be zero.
And in a state with a heavy
military presence, the tone
seemed more aggressive than in
earlier debates.
Gingrich drew strong
applause when he said: "Andrew
Jackson had a pretty clear idea
about America's enemies. Kill
them."
munication states.
If the regents approve the
request, the facility is scheduled
for completion by winter 2014.
Regents to vote on utilities
upgrade for Northwood
Apartments
In an effort to improve safe-
ty and efficiency, the aging
Northwood Apartments are
scheduled to receive utility and
safety upgrades to modernize
the buildings, pending approval
by the regents.
In a communication to the
regents, Slottow and E. Royster
Harper, the University's vice
president for student affairs,
have requested $7.5 million for
upgrades to Northwood Apart-
ments I, II and II.
The upgrades will replace the
boiler systems with more effi-
cient designs and also update the
fire safety systems to meet "cur-
rent life standards," according to
the communication.
Slottow and Harper noted
that the apartments currently
house 686 students, and it's
unclear whether the project will
affect the availability of resi-
dences.
If approved, the communica-
tion stated that the project is
scheduled for completion in the
summer of 2013.

RECRUIT

ing the fraternity on campus,
since many members already
had other housing arrangements
prior to joining the fraternity.
The fraternity encountered
problems after an underage mem-
ber was admitted to the hospital
for alcohol poisoning in 2007.
The incident was one of a series
of problems, including a series of
Facebook pictures that emerged
depicting objectified women and
underage drinking, that drew the
attention of the national organi-
zation in 2007 and ultimately led
to the removal of the Beta Theta
Pi fraternity from campus.
"That's not what Beta's all
about," Wright said.
The fraternity also faced scru-
tiny after a young woman was
raped at a 2001 party that was
unregistered with the Interfra-
ternity Council. All fraterni-
ties are mandated to notify IFC
about events where alcohol will
be consumed and must adhere to
enforced codes that include the
presence of sober monitors.
Since its return in fall 2010, the
fraternity has shifted its focus
to forming a strong community
in an alcohol-free environment.
Wright said the fraternity has
also installed a director of re-
establishment within the house
to help rebuild the chapter and
recruit potential members.
Wright explained that during
the fraternity's absence on cam-

pus, the Beta house was rented to
graduate students to avoid losing
ownership of the property. New
members were initiated last win-
ter and last fall, and this Septem-
ber a group of members moved
into the house.
With members and non-mem-
bers residing in the Beta house,
Wright said the fraternity plans
extensively before holding a
party out of respect for all resi-
dents.
"(Parties are) a very tough sit-
uation to handle, but, at the same
time, we're very respectful and
we try to inform (non-members)
well in advance," Wright said.
He added that portions of the
house are blocked off to visitors
and non-members are notified of
plans as soon as possible.
"Obviously we'll respect
(non-members) because they're
residents involved in part of the
housing operations as much aswe
are," Wright said.
Williams, who is also a mem-
ber of the fraternity's advisory
board, said he has helped with
the re-colonization of the frater-
nity, including enforcing policies
and ensuring operations in the
house run smoothly. Williams is
also employed by Alpha Manage-
ment Group, the company work-
ing to fill vacancies in the house.
"I basically serve as a mentor
for not only the students in our
fraternity, but pretty much any-
one who lives in this house, in
terms of maintaining a diverse,
comfortable and intellectually
stimulating environment," Wil-

hams said.
Williams said there is no set
limit on how many non-members
can live in the Beta house, adding
that from the interactions he has
witnessed, he believes the Beta
and non-Beta residents get along
well.
"It really adds onto the atmo-
sphere in a positive way, and
there's a lot of people that we
enjoy hanging out with," Wil-
liams said. "It's surprisingly a
very respectable and fun envi-
ronment to be in, and it definitely
works out."
LSA senior Leah Heller, who
has lived in Beta house since May,
said her brother is a Beta member
and recommended the house to
her.
"(The house) seemed really
nice," Heller said. "At first, I
didn't believe it ... it's nice and
welcoming."
Non-members in the Beta
house can purchase a meal plan
through the fraternity, which
Heller said gave her the chance
to interact with many of the Beta
members.
LSA sophomore Maxwell Salva-
tore is a Beta brother who has lived
in the house since September. He
said the members and non-mem-
bers coexist peacefully together.
"We don't get in each other's
way," he said, adding that he
enjoys the environment of the
house and plans to live there for
the 2012-2013 academic year.

Hunwick keys
crucial sweep

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
CLEVELAND - At times dur-
ing Sunday's game, it looked like
Shawn Hunwick forgot he was
playing in an outdoor hockey
game.
Besides the giant ice luge in
the background and the below-
freezing temperatures, the fifth-
year senior goaltender looked
right at home between the posts.
Hunwick had 31 saves in the
Frozen Diamond Faceoff, as the
Michigan hockey team complet-
ed its weekend sweep of Ohio
State, 4 - 1. The Buckeyes' lone
goal was off a deflection and
was one of few open looks on the
night - Hunwick was at his best.
His performance on Sunday
came after a gem of a game on
Friday, where he saved a career-
high 46 shots in a 4-0 victory
over Ohio State. So, over the span
of two games, Hunwick allowed

only one goal on 77 shots.
"He gives our team a lot of con-
fidence, and he is playing rock-
solid right now," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson. "To come
out of the weekend with only one
(goal) against - you have to be
playing well to do that against a
team like Ohio."
Even though he entered the
game from the Cleveland Indians
dugout and not from the locker
room of the Schottenstein Cen-
ter in Columbus, Hunwick didn't
miss a beat from Friday's game.
"I thought (Hunwick) played
very well on Friday night, and
I thought he carried that again
tonight," said Ohio State coach
Mark Osiecki. "When he did have
a couple opportunities, he was
there, and he was rock solid. You
know that in him. He's a proven
goaltender."
It also helped that Hunwick
played most of the game while

CLEVELAND -
There was a lot of talk in'
the months leading up
to the Frozen Diamond
Faceoff. It wasn't supposed to be
just a hockey game - it was so
much more.
It was the
first outdoor
hockey game
in the state of
Ohio. It was a
hockey game
in a major
league ball- LIZ
park where
a crowd of VUKELICH
up to 43,000
people would
come and watch two rival pro-
grams duke it out. It became an
event.
A 200-foot longsnow tube hill
and a skating loop constructed
in the outfield made ita fan
experience. Michigan and Ohio
State fans alike could watch
their team practice before head-

ing inside for a meet-and-greet
autograph session.
Michigan coach Red Beren-
son called the Frozen Diamond
Faceoff a "spectacle," different
to any outdoor game he had ever
coached in before, including the
Big Chill. The Ohio State play-
ers were in awe after their first
outdoor experience on a national
stage - Buckeye forward Chris
Crane said that even though the
loss stung, the atmosphere was
unforgettable.
But in the end, none of this -
the records, fireworks and fan-
fare - actually matters.

with a 4-1 win over the Buck.
eyes and a giant trophy to prove
it - the players aren't going to
remember the playthat put the
game in the bag, nor any mis-
takes.

weekend was all about returning

On Tuesday night, the two
teams will open the 2012 series

ing much to prove. Michigan
State (4-1 Big Ten, 15-3 overall)
is looking to regain control of the
rivalry, and Michigan (4-2, 14-4)
wants to show that last year's
performances were not flukes.
But the Wolverines are a bit
hesitant to declare themselves

the better program after last sea-
son's heroics. After all, it was a
down year for the Spartans, who
weren't ranked at season's end.
"We. still got a ways to go
before we get our program to
the level where they've been at,"
said senior guard and co-captain
Stu Douglass. "They've gotten
to Final Fours, and they've been
very good the past 10 to 15 years.
So we know we've got a ways to
go, and we respect them alot, but

we can't dwell on sweeping them
last year and thinking it was the
greatest thing ever.
"I want to go out and sweep
them again this year and end my
career on a good note with the
rivalry."
This season's pair of contests
could be a bit more telling in
terms of the balance of power
in the state of Michigan. Both
squads are ranked - Michigan at
No. 20 and Michigan State at No.

9 - and they're neck-and-neck in
the conference standings.
There are no more excuses
this year.
"It makes it a bigger rivalry
when both teams are doing well,"
said Michigan State coach Tom
Izzo ina teleconference on Mon-
day. "Any time you've got a rival-
ry with two ranked teams, that
just stokes the fire even more.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Michigan's Team 133 will be led by rising seniors

Simply telling the players
how to lead wouldn't be
enough. Darrell Funk's
duty was to inspire organic
confidence, an idea planted and
prepared to
sprout yet still
originating
within one-
self.
He passed
out bindersr
full of exam-
ples of leaders L
both good and TIM
bad. Then he ROHAN
started the
conversation,
but it would have to be the juniors
on the Michigan football team
who finished it. Funk wouldn't
call out anyone who didn't feel the
need to speak up.
Funk posed questions: Can a
leader still be a leader, even though
he may not play as much? What
happens ifa freshman doesn'twant
to get on board?
How do you handle those situ-
ations?
"Surprisingly, everybody
spoke," said redshirt junior line-
backer Kenny Demens.
Jordan Kovacs spoke. Ricky
Barnum spoke. Roy Roundtree.
J.T. Floyd. Quiet guys spoke.
Walk-ons did, too.
"Guys who you just never
thought would have that sense
of,'I can lead, or I know what it
takes,"' Demens continued. "It
was an eye-opener."
For one day a week over four
weeks last spring, Funk wasn't
teaching his guards how to pull -
lhe was molding future leaders.
Under Brady Hoke's watch,
the football program's source of
leadership shifted from the coach
to the players. He told them they
wouldn't get far if he had to lead
the team. And he wanted to lead
with his seniors. To do this, Hoke
installed leadership seminars -
one for each class, each led by a
different coach (offensive line
coach Funk led the juniors' work-

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Michigan juniors Kenny Demens and Jordan Kovacs will be tasked with leading a defense that turned itself into one of the nation's finest during the 2011 season.

One saying from the seminar
stuck with him: "Let your actions
speak so loudly that they can
hardly hear you speak."
Van Bergen said a fewbig stops
against Western Michigan in the
season opener made the freshman
into Kovacs-believers.
Speaking up isn't natural for
Demens, who was implored by
Hoke to become a better leader at
middle linebacker. It's his job to
make checks and calls.
"When we're on the field and
things aren'tgoing good, I need
to be the leader," Demens said.
"I need to be like, 'Hey guys, let's
do better, let's hitharder, let's be
technique sound."'
Hoke once told him: "It's our
job to coach, but it's your job to
take the team and roll with it."
By the end of the season it was
common to see Troy Woolfolk and
J.T. Floyd address poor corner-
back play in practice. Hey guys,
let's pick it up. Hold on, real quick,
let's huddle up.
The leaders before them said
the same things. But the losing cul-
ture quieted their voices, softened
their stance.
This season, "hearingthose
words they had to say, I could tell
they really meant it," Demens said.
"I feel like I have to fill bigshoes."
"Denard's always been a great
leader of this team," Kovacs added.
"Then you've got guys like Craig
Roh, J.T. Floyd, Roy Roundtree,
those guys really stepped up in
those meetings, and they've really
stepped up for usthis year."
Soon, Van Bergen, Martin,
Molk, Koger and Woolfolk will be
gone.
Kovacs, Demens, Floyd, Robin-
son and Roundtree will meet with
Hoke and study their own senior
handbooks.
Hoke is right: Team 133 won't
go very far if he's the one that has
to lead it.

and how to follow.
Leadership proved to be a
strength of Hoke's 11-2, Sugar-
Bowl-winningteam. If Michigan
is poised to repeat that success,
it'll lie on the shoulders of a those
next in line: the Kovacs's, the
Demens's and Roundtree's.
Though the following part, as
fifth-year senior Ryan Van Bergen
will tell you, is always the most
undervalued and perhaps most
important. After Michigan beat
Illinois in November, Van Bergen
was asked about the seniors' lead-
ership. Unsolicited, he bragged
about the followers, the under-
classmen who bought in. There
are three levels, he explained:
leaders, those who are about to
lead and the followers.
When Hoke and strength and
conditioning coach Aaron Well-
man led the seniors' leadership
seminar, they asked the leaders
of Team 132 what kind of leaders
they wanted to be. This spring,

they'll ask next year's seniors the Bergen, about how a CEO reduced

Daily Sparta Writer
The Michigan women's basket-
ball game against Minnesota on
Sunday was a contest of fits and
starts.
Begin- MINNESOTA 57
ning the MICHIGAN 61
second half
with a one-point lead, the Wol-
verines quickly found themselves
down 10 to the Gophers.
Thoughts flashed back to the
Penn State loss earlier in the
week, tempers flared, and after a
handful of collaborative efforts
Michigan tied it up at 42.
On the next play, junior guard
Jenny Ryan ripped the ball away
from a Minnesota forward, took
two dribbles and threaded the
ball perfectly into the hands of
junior center Rachel Sheffer for
the and-one lay-in. From that
point forward, with Ryan and
Sheffer at the helm, the team
never looked back.
The Wolverines went on to
defeat the Gophers, 61-57.
"Our kids were resilient," said
Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth. "They lost to Penn State the
other night, and so when they got
behind in this one they made sure
to keep their composure and grab
key rebounds and make key shots.
They have a lot of burning desire
inside them - a lot of fight."
The high scorers of the night
were Sheffer with 20 points and
junior guard Kate Thompson,
who racked up 13 for the Wolver-
ines.
Despite a rocky start, Sheffer
came alive down the stretch of
the second half and led the Wol-
verines on an 18-2 run. Her quick,
seemingly effortless footwork
gave her moves down on the block
an almost artful nature.
She possessed both the airy
essence of a ballerina and the
sheer force of a lumberjack - a
strange and wonderful mix that
not only gave Michigan opportu-
nities around the basket, but also
gave shooters like Thompson and
Ryan open looks around the arc
when their defenders collapsed

Junior center Rachel Sheffer scored a team-high 20 points in Michigan's win.

inside.
Although the Wolverines
emerged triumphant, the 10-point
deficit at the start of the second
half marked a dark time for the
team, and led to a period of major
adjustments on both sides of the
floor.
Borseth and his team were
trying different defenses, differ-
ent matchups, different play calls
and yet nothing seemed to click.
Finally Borseth called a timeout.
He gathered his players together
and asked flat out, "What do you
want to do?"
"They told me to get out of the
way and let them do what they
do," Borseth said. "I was call-
ing plays because I thought we
could manufacture points from
the bench, and it wasn't working.
The kids play together well. They
understand what each other's
strengths and weaknesses are.
"Sheffer hit seven in a row at
one point, and I think that if we
kept calling plays, that wouldn't
have happened, and we wouldn't
have won."
Michigan, the relatively vet-

eran squad who had grown up
in a purely motion-offense based *
program, managed to find solace
in their comfort zone - which is
not too dissimilar from absolute
chaos.
Ryan, the mayhem-inducing
shooting guard, not only thrived
in the chaos, she looked to create
it every time down the court. Her
efforts were clearly outlined on
the stat sheet.
Ryan had eight points, five
assists, six rebounds and six
steals - one of which she earned
while sprawled on the ground,
giving new meaning to the term
"taking it lying down."
"You can never underesti-
mate Jenny," Sheffer said. "She's
always showing you more. Even
when you think she can't do any
more she continues to give you
something. Tonight she gave us
six key steals. We really base our
energy around her."
Luckily for the Wolverines,
Ryan's energy peaked at the end
of the second half, giving them
the extra push to pull out the win
and end on a start instead of a fit.

Blue-collar Wolverines triumph

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
CLEVELAND - Skyscrap-
ers cast shadows over the bright;
lights of Progressive Field after
sunset on Sunday. Cleveland,
save for its illuminated frozen
diamond on the Cuyahoga River,
stood eerily dark, its skyline
drearier than Ohio State's bench
in the waning moments of its
4-1 defeat. Hours later, the city's
blue-collar workforce trudged to
work, declining a long weekend
for another chance to punch their
time card.
The team in those buildings'
shadows, the Michigan hockey
team riding high on a nine-game
unbeaten streak, mirrored Cleve-
land's workman mentality. Fri-
day night, the Buckeyes outshot
the Wolverines, 46-33, and Mich-
igan still managed a shutout win.
Ohio State's shot output, which
gave fifth-year senior netminder
Shawn Hunwick a career high
for saves, shouldn't surprise any-
one. That's how the Buckeyes like
to play - they fire shots on goal
from all angles. Ohio State coach
Mark Osiecki refuses to squander
a single possession.
In short, No. 2 Ohio State
earned its ranking by work-
ing hard with the puck. But the
Buckeyes got outworked every
which way in Sunday's Frozen
Diamond Faceoff. And that's
precisely how Michigan turned
the corner, lifting itself from the
depths of the CCHA standings to
its third-place standing. Though
the Wolverines wore their alter-
nate maize jerseys at Progressive
Field, they never stopped don-
ning their blue-collar mentality.
"Our team knows what it takes
to play in a game like this," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"I really liked the way our team
came out and just worked hard,
and we got the bounces because
of that."

HUNWICK
From Page lB
the team was ahead, after junior
forward Chris Brown took a
rebound off a shot from sopho-
more defenseman Kevin Clare,
spun 180 degrees to his left, and
slid the puck past Buckeye net-
minder Cal Heeter.
Brown had a hand in the Wol-
verines' next goal, too, assisting
on freshman forward Alex Gup-
till's team-leading12th goal of the
year. Michigan stayed in control
for most of the first period, keep-
ing the puck in Ohio State's zone
for most of the time.
The Wolverines' only costly
penalty of the night came at the
end of the first period, but even
then, they were two seconds away
from killing it unscathed. Hun-
wick was caught out of position
after a rebound - really, the only
time he was in the wrong spot
- and Buckeye forward Chris
Crane whittled the advantage
down to one just SO seconds into
the second period.
But after sophomore forward
Derek DeBlois and senior cap-
tain David Wohlberg scored
back-to-back in a 28-second
stretch later in the period, the
momentum, and the game, gave
way to Michigan.
In the second period, Michi-
gan's outdoor experience showed.
This was the third outdoor
game for Michigan's juniors
and seniors, including the Camp
Randall Classic in Wisconsin in
2010 and The Big Chill at the Big
House last December.
Ohio State got flustered, but

the Wolverines kept their cool
and put the game away.
It wasn't just Hunwick that
gave Ohio State's offense fits,
though. Michigan's defense suf-
focated the Buckeyes as soon as
they crossed the red line, basi-
cally eliminating shots near the
crease. Hunwick's goaltending
was superb, but the defense also
did its job.
"The biggest thing is that
everyone is taking pride in their
job in the defensive zone," said
senior defenseman Greg Pateryn.
"Everyone is rolling right now
and doingwhat they are supposed
to, and you can't ask for much
more - one goal-against over a
weekend is pretty good."
Osiecki added: "Lets give cred-
it where credit is due - Michigan
is really good. Their defensemen
do a tremendous job, and having
(sophomore defenseman) Jon
Merrill back in the lineup is ... in
my opinion, he is the best defen-
seman in the country."
Last time Hunwick played in
an outdoor game - the Big Chill
- he didn't know he was going
to play until after warm-ups,
when then-starting-goalie Bryan
Hogan went down with a groin
injury. This time around, Hun-
wick knew he was going to be
playing, and it showed the whole
weekend. The spectacle of the
Frozen Diamond Faceoff didn't
seem to faze him at all, even
as fireworks flew through the
27-degree night sky.
One goal on 77 shots - just
another day at the office for
Michigan's backbone, leading his
team in its nine-game unbeaten
streak.

Michigan senior captain Luke Glendening is the epitome of Michigan coach Red Berenson's blue-collar philosophy.

It's become a trend for his
team, replacing the destructive
tendencies that contributed to
its November slide, which is now
just a harrowing reminder in the
rearview mirror.
In the series finale, the Wol-
verines edged Ohio State in shots
on goal, 42-32.
The Buckeyes were forced to
be content with shots from the
point, ones that Hunwick gloved
with ease. Meanwhile, Michi-
gan slammed its way into the
slot, making Ohio State ditch its
Hobey Baker nominee and start-
ing goaltender Cal Heeter in
favor of backup Brady Hjelle.
Coming into the series, the
numbers favored Heeter, but by
the end, nobody was questioning
who the best goaltender on the
ice was. Hunwick, like his team-
mates in front of him, worked
harder.

OUTDOORS
From Page 1B
to their roots.
From the moment Michigan
stepped onto the rink on Sat-
urday afternoon for their first
skate, all the players could talk
about how cool the environment
was. Everyone - from wide-
eyed freshman Alex Guptill to
seasoned outdoor game veteran
Luke Glendening - took time to
just appreciate the game.
Because they were playing
hockey the way it was supposed to

be played - outdoors, with tem-
peratures just below freezing and
ice surrounded by freshly fallen
snow that the team had to shovel
off the rink Sunday morning.
Most of the team can share
stories about playing pond
hockey. For any player, skating
outside is about as untarnished as
you can get. There's no Zamboni
smoothing the ice or fancy locker
room to warm up in afterwards -
it becomes purely about the love
of the game.
Maybe it was the environment,
or maybe it was because the Wol-
verines came into Sunday's game

riding a wave of momentum.
Whatever the cause, the outdoor
setting rubbed off on Michigan,
and they started to play hockey
the way it's supposed to be played
for them - throwback Michigan
hockey.
The grittiness and tough-
ness of that throwback hockey
has worked for Michigan since
it became a varsity program 90
years ago. It's how Berenson
paved his way from Regina to
Ann Arbor, and how the Wolver-
ines brought nine national cham-
pionship trophies back to Yost Ice
Arena.

But at some point, Michigan
forgot about that kind of hockey.
They came off a trip to the Fro-
zen Four championship game
season and were No. 1on the eve
of CCHA play in October.
Perhaps the hype was just too
much for them, and they suffered
for it- a seven-game winless
streak spanning the month of
November taught them that. But
something changed for the team,
starting in December.
They went to Alaska and found
themselves amidst the ice and
snow. Heart conquered the hype.
The team went back to throw-

back Michigan hockey. It worked,
and came full circle for them in
the snowy outfield of Progressive
Field.
The forwards aren't scared
anymore. They're not afraid to
slam into the boards or oppo-
nents to go after loose pucks.
They didn't notice the fireworks
lighting up the Cleveland skyline
or Ohio State's band marching
on the ice - it was all about the
game.
With the forwards takingcare
of providing the offensive drive,
the defense's job becomes much
easier - they easily stifled the

Buckeye offense on Sunday.
It took a whole semester for
the Wolverines to learn their
lesson. The losses were a seri-
ous wake-up call and now the
team knows what it takes to
walk away with a victory. Michi-
gan fans won't care about the
fanfare of the Frozen Diamond
Faceoff. But they'll remember
two things - an afternoon spent
watching hockey outside and a
team that played with spunk to
pull outa win.

Rival teams swap roles in weekend sweep

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
CLEVELAND - David Wohl-
berg heard a voice.
The senior forward, who had
just collected the puck along the
boards, couldn't see the voice, but
he heard it. Perhaps if the game
were at Yost - if the game hadn't
been outdoors, if the stadium had
a roof - he wouldn't have heard
the voice. But he did, and he slid
the puck in its direction.
It worked. The voice, belong-
ing to sophomore forward Derek
DeBlois, took Wohlberg's center-
ing pass and one-timed it past
Ohio State goalie Cal Heeter.
Less than 30 seconds later,
0 Wohlberg scored, too.
Immediately after that, he
heard more voices, this time
belonging to the thousands of
chilly Michigan fans who made
the trip to Cleveland to witness a
4-1 Michigan victory in the Fro-
zen Diamond Faceoff.
It took just 30 seconds in the
second period for Michigan to put
the finishing touches on its sweep
of Ohio State and move from a tie
for sixth place in the CCHA to
third.
"You saw after they scored
their first goal, it was a big upris-
ing for them," said Wohlberg of
Ohio State's second-period goal
that cut Michigan's lead to one.
"Then when we go out and we
score two real quick, it's a big
push for us, and I think it emptied
their spirits."
The impact from Michigan's
two-goal flurry weighed visibly
on the Buckeyes. They hardly
threatened Michigan fifth-year
senior goalie Shawn Hunwick in
the remaining 30 minutes of the
game, and when they walked into

the locker room for the second
intermission, their body language
spoke volumes.
After the game, Chris Crane's
red, puffy eyes said it all. The
Buckeye sophomore forward, and
the rest of the Ohio State hockey
team, wanted this one badly.
Despite a two-goal deficit after
the opening period, the game was
there for the taking after Crane's
goal came just 50 seconds into the
second frame, making the score
2-1.
The game was turning. Ohio
State controlled the start of the
second. They took the momentum.
Then it was gone in a matter of
30 seconds.
"(It) deflated us," said Ohio
State captain Cory Schneider. "I
thought our compete level went
down a little after those two
goals."
Ohio State coach Mark Osiecki
sensed the momentum switch
and reacted by pulling Heeter,
who has been one of the confer-
ence's best goalies this season.

The move responded more to the
swing in emotions than a lack of
confidence in Heeter.
"Two goals happen for us,
bang-bang, and we had to make a
change," Osiecki said. "It was just
a situation where maybe this will
jump start our team."
Backup goalie Brad Hjelle
didn't allow a goal on 18 shots in
his 30 minutes of work, but by
then, it was too late.
Wohlberg probably stole one on
his goal, with a shot that Heeter
usually saves. Wohlberg skated
with the puck for half the length
of the ice. He attacked Heeter
toward his glove side, flicked one
toward his pad, and somehow
forced the puck through.
"On Friday, I tried to cut to the
middle, and it didn't work out,"
Wohlberg said. "But tonight, I
tried to put it off the pad, and
it snuck right under there ... (I)
just (used) outside speed and it
worked out."
After this weekend's sweep,
Michigan finds itself just five

points behind the first-place
Buckeyes. The first time the two
teams played this season, Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson said he
thought Michigan outplayed Ohio
State at times, but not enough to
overcome a few unlucky breaks.
The roles reversed this week-
end. The Ohio State sweep in
November catapulted the Buck-
eyes to the top of the CCHA
standings, while Michigan fell
into a long slump. Now, it is Ohio
State that finds itself sliding, and
the Wolverines haven't lost in
nine games.
There's more: In the second
game of that November series,
Michigan was the team that
grabbed the momentum. They
too lost it in a two-goal burst in
less than 30 seconds in the second
period.
Sound familiar? This time, the
skate was on the other foot.
"We just kept bringing the
pressure every single line," Wohl-
berg said. "It wasn't them ... it was
our stronger play."

court earlier this season. But they
don't explain the loss in any clear
terms beyond Mysticism, Daoism
or Tebowism.
The real explanation for a
loss like this is a little less fun to
mock. The Wolverines have two
star players. If neither impacts
the outcome of the game, Michi-
gan will likely lose, unless it's
playing Atlanta A&T.
Sophomore forward Tim
Hardaway Jr. and freshman point
guard Trey Burke are the two
stars on the team. Sure, Zack
Novak is a sensational role player,
leader and ambassador, and
once in a while, Evan Smotrycz
reminds us how to spell his
name. But neither of them dictate
whether or not Michigan will win
a game.
Michigan is a 10th-place team
in the conference without Hard-
away and Burke, so it only makes
sense that it would play like such
on Saturday with Trim Hurke
contributing nothing.
Hardaway shot 2-for-13 from
the field and missed all eight of
his 3-point attempts. He was able
to get to the foul line, but only
when he thought better of tak-
ing contested 3-pointers early in
the shot clock. And with just two
rebounds,.two assists and two
turnovers, it was clear that Hard-
away was better off staying in
Ann Arbor for the weekend.
Burke is a different story.

Last Wednesday, Northwest-
ern almost took down Michigan
at Crisler Center. The Wolverines
made a second-half comeback and
needed overtime to stave off the
Wildcats. With Burke struggling
throughout regulation, Michigan
needed Hardaway to be effective.
"It's no secret, (Hardaway is)

"We don't beat Northwestern if

IOWA CITY - After a terrible
first half on Wednesday against
Northwestern, it would've been
hard to imagine the Michigan
men's basketball team playing a
worse first half all season. But the
Wolverines
did just that MICHIGAN 59
in Iowa. IOWA 75
Michi-
gan couldn't find any rhythm on
the offensive end, even before
freshman point guard Trey
Burke took a seat for the last 13
minutes of the half after picking
up his second foul. The struggles
continued into the second half,
when the Wolverines could never
sustain momentum, eventually
falling 75-59 to the Hawkeyes,
remaining winless in true road
games this season.
Michigan shot just 25.8 per-
cent (8-for-31) from 3-point
range.
Burke was the Wolverines'
only offense early on, leading
Michigan (4-2 Big Ten, 14-4 over-
all) with just six first-half points
as the Wolverines sputtered to a
33-23 deficit at halftime.
Senior guard Zack Novak kept
the Wolverines in the game early
in the second half, knocking
down two 3-pointers, and a Tim
Hardaway Jr. layup plus a free
throw drew Michigan within
six with just under 13 minutes
left in the game. But the Hawk-
eyes surged ahead for 10 straight
points, highlighted by a two-
hand slam from Iowa's Melsahn
Basabe that ignited the crowd,
forcing Beilein to call a timeout.
When Novak finally ended the
run with his third 3-pointer of
the half, it halted a span of 4:58 in
which the Wolverines were held
without a point.
Michigan finally found second-
half momentum with just under
six minutes to play, when senior
guard Stu Douglass capped a 7-2
Wolverine run that pulled them
within 12 points, prompting Iowa
coach Fran McCaffery to take a
timeout.
The Hawkeyes (3-3, 11-8)
missed a shot right out of the
break, but Iowa's Zach McCabe
was able to corral the miss -
which had found its way to half
court - by out-diving junior
guard Matt Vogrich. Moments
later, Iowa's Matt Gatens con-

netted on a 3-pointer to put Iowa
ahead by 15, essentially clinching
the game.
Gatens tied for a game-high in
points with 19, thanks largely to
four 3-pointers.
It was McCabe who set the
tone for the Hawkeyes from the
get-go, scoring the game's first
six points and finishing with 11
points and seven rebounds.
Burke got Michigan on the
board - after more than three
-and-a-half scoreless minutes
- with a 3-pointer and followed
up an Iowa 2-point basket with
another long-range bomb.
The Wolverines were again
marred by porous first-half
shooting. After shooting 28.1 per-
cent against the Wildcats earlier
in the week, Michigan connected
on just 15.8 percent (3-of-16) of
its 3-pointers on Saturday. Hard-
away Jr. was fairly absent in
the first half, scoring just three
points, finishing the game with
nine. Sophomore forward Evan
Smotrycz couldn't find his way
out of a recent funk, missing all
six of hisfield-goal attempts and
being held scoreless for the first
time this season.
Hardaway Jr. put the Wolver-
ines ahead at the halfway point
of the first half with a free throw,
but Iowa reserve Josh Oglesby
came off the bench and scored
seven consecutive points for the
Hawkeyes, who entered halftime
leading, 33-23, thanks to a buzz-
er-beatingshot by Devyn Marble.
Burke finished with 19 points
- most of them coming late in
the second half, while Novak
finished with 14 points and eight
rebounds, despite being in foul
trouble for much of the second
half. Though Burke still had a
good stat-line, the freshman is
yet to win a true road test.
"I wouldn't even say it's
the crowd, really," Burke said.
"When they made their run, we
were calm when we were in the
huddle.... The visiting team feeds
off the crowd ar- I they hit some
big shots. It's just the home-court
advantage, I guess. We have it at
home. We just have to continue to
learn so we can get some bigwins
on the road."
Michigan now has just three
days to bounce back from this
loss and prepare for Tuesday's
matchup with Michigan State,
who might be ranked in the top-5
in next week's rankings.

WRESTLING
Michigan captures eight of 10
match titles against Hoosiers

Despite beam, 'M'tops OSU

By LIZ NAGLE
Daily Sports Writer

Friday the 13th is a worrisome
day for the superstitious. And
though the No. 11 Michigan wres-
tling team felt none of its effects,
its opponent suffered a night of
bad luck.
The Wolverines walked off the
mat last weekend with their tails
between their legs after a harsh
loss against Illinois. But they
looked like a brand new team on
Friday, dominating Indiana in a
33-6 victory.
And they were certainly
dressed like one. After more than
two decades, Michigan coach Joe
McFarland decided it was time
to test out the white singlets at
home.
"They look great in the box,
but you're never sure how they're
going to look on the guys until
you get them on," said Michigan
assistant coach Sean Bormet. "But
I think they look pretty good. It's
good to change it up. The guys
were excited to get them."
That excitement and change
translated onto the mat. Michi-
gan left the Hoosiers scoreless in
the firstseven bouts while racking
up bonus points with major deci-
sions, technical falls and a pin by
133-pound senior Zac Stevens.
Following an aggressive start,
Stevens forced the fall on Indi-
ana redshirt freshman Joe Duca
in just 1:42 to win his first home
match this season.
"It felt good,kind of like getting

said.

Last Friday night was the first
event of the season for the No.
10 Michigan women's gymnas-
tics team at
the newly OHIO STAT E 62
renovated MICHIGAN 73
Crisler
Center. Competing against No. 18
Ohio State, the pressure was defi-
nitely on.
The Wolverines ended the
competition with a final score of
195.500, besting the Buckeye total
of 195.175. Four Michigan gym-
nasts won individual titles for
specific events, including junior
captain Katie Zurales on beam
and in the all-around.
There were four events being
judged - vault, bars, balance
beam, and floor. After both the
vault and the bars rotations,
Michigan was up, 98.325-97.650, a
pretty significant lead in gymnas-
tics competition.
Then came time for the beam.
After sophomore Joanna Samp-
son and freshman Annette Miele
fell in the middle of their rou-
tines and others looked wobbly,
Ohio State was back in the natch,
aheadby just .225.
"The kids have done really,
really well (in practice), so actu-
ally I was a little bit surprised that
we didn't do as well as we have
been doing on beam," said Michi-
gan coach Bev Plocki.
The floor exercise was the final
rotation - a game changer for
Michigan. Junior Natalie Beil-
stein won first place in this event,
tying a career-high of 9.925.
"Our strongest event for the
team as a whole (is) floor," Samp-

fun with the crowd and the judg-

gets so into it."
"Overall, I think we did great
on three events for the first meet,"
Plocki said. "Had we stayed on
beam, right now we would be
sitting with one of the highest
opening scores in the country, so
I'm very optimistic about what I
think we're capable of this year
and excited to have this first one
behind us."
The team has changed a lot
since last year, losing five seniors
including Kylee Botterman, the
2011 NCAA All-Around Cham-
pion. The Wolverines gained just
two freshman, Sachi Sugiyama
and Miele. This season, the team
is not only smaller in numbers but
also younger.
"There's been all this conversa-
tion about how we graduated five
kids, we have no seniors, we lost
all of our leadership," Plocki said.
"In reality, I think we do have
some underclassmen on this team
that are becoming really good
leaders. They've really banded
together and they're ready to go
out and prove to the world that
they can stillbe good without Bot-
terman and some of the seniors."

The team certainly proved they
were capable in this event.
"I was really excited for my
team 'to bring it and to show
everyone what a young team can
do," Zurales said. "I know we're
small but everyone's ready and
everyone's feeling really confi-
dent."
The team prepared for thesea-
son throughout the fall and has
had a few mock intrasquads and
one official intrasquad.
"I think (the intrasquad) got
everyone exposed to the competi-
tion setting and also got the fresh-
man in Crisler Center," Zurales
said. "It helped to get the nerves
out and to be able to also visualize
yourself doing your routine."
This Saturday, the women's
gymnastics team will compete
against No. 22 Minnesota in Min-
neapolis.
"I think next week we'll be
ready to go and really do our best
on everything," Sampson said. "As
a team I think we're just gonna do
a little bit more of the fine tweak-
ing now that we've actuallygotten
out, shown what we can do, and
really gotten the season going."
