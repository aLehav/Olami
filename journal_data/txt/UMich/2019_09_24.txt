Ann 
Arbor 
city 
officials 
discussed two ordinances that 
would expand the number of 
recreational marijuana facilities 
in the city in a special City 
Council work session Monday 
night. Approximately 25 citizens 
attended the session.
At 
last 
week’s 
meeting, 
councilmembers 
gave 
initial 
approval to the ordinances that 
would allow temporary permits 
for events with onsite marijuana 

sale 
and 
consumption. 
They 
are expected to be approved in 
October, right before the state will 
begin accepting applications for 
recreational marijuana licenses 
from businesses on Nov. 1.
The 
work 
session 
began 
with a presentation on the new 
ordinances. 
Planning 
Manager 
Brett Lenart explained recent legal 
history regarding the legalization 
of marijuana, including the 2008 
Michigan Medical Marijuana Act 
and the 2018 Michigan Regulation 
and Taxation of Marijuana Act.
“The city obviously has a more 

unique history with marijuana 
than a lot of other communities, 
both in the state of Michigan and 
throughout the country,” Lenart 
said. “A history of involvement in 
Hash Bash, activist groups who 
were pretty agressive in some eyes 
at the time, municipal regulation 
for governing marijuana in the 
community. And more recently, 
that history has evolved from a 
series of legal statutes and acts.” 
Lenart 
explained 
the 
proposed land use regulations for 
recreational marijuana. He said 
many of the recommended changes 

included removing “medical” from 
previously established terms. 
Additionally, Lenart addressed 
the amendment to implement a 
designated marijuana consumption 
facility, where adults 21 and older 
would be able to both buy and 
consume marijuana inside the 
place of purchase. These facilities 
would be allowed in commercial 
districts and have to be located 
1,000 feet from schools.
Lenart 
also 
discussed 
the 
creation of marijuana retailers and 
marijuana microbusinesses.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The Academics Beat at The 
Michigan Daily recently sat down 
with the new LSA Dean Anne 
Curzan for an interview to discuss 
her vision for the college and its 
many programs. 
The Michigan Daily: What 
are your goals as dean of LSA?
Anne Curzan: I’d start by 
saying LSA is a remarkable place 
filled 
with 
inspiring 
people, 

and it’s such an honor for me at 
this moment in my career to get 
the chance to try to ensure that 
this can continue to be a place 
where everyone can do their best 
work. That’s faculty and staff 
and students, both graduate and 
undergraduate. That everybody 
can thrive here. In terms of my 
broader goals, I’m committed to 
maintaining our excellence — first 
in research and teaching, that’s 
core to our mission. Also core to 
our mission is our commitment 
to diversity, equity and inclusion. 

That is something that we will 
continue to work very hard on. 
(I’m) committed to advocating 
for the value of the liberal arts 
in terms of our teaching and the 
education that we provide and our 
research mission.
Then, 
how 
we 
contribute 
to the public good. It’s a public 
institution, and we do really 
important work for the public 
good. We’ll stay very focused on 
that. Another one of my goals, 
as I said, is really to ensure 
that everyone can thrive here. 

That means staying focused on 
purposeful inclusion and equity 
and access for everyone. It also, 
for me, means staying focused on 
purpose. I’m a big believer that if 
you are focused on the work that 
matters, on the work that gives 
you purpose, wherever you are, 
it leads to fulfilling happy lives … 
I also will be staying focused on 
well-being, that’s very important 
to me for everyone in the 
community..

An Ann Arbor-based public 
interest law firm, the Thomas 
More Law Center, along with 
Caledonia-based Bursch Law 
PLLC, has been representing 
the state of Tennessee’s general 
assembly in a case opposing the 
federal government’s refugee 
resettlement efforts since 2016. 
Tennessee, much like other 
states around the country, has 
received an influx of refugees 
in the last decade, averaging 
around 1,000 refugees per year, 
largely 
from 
conflict-ridden 
areas such as Iraq and Sudan. 
In 2017, the state legislature 
refused to provide funds for 
Medicaid for settled asylum-
seekers and sued the federal 
government.
After Tennessee’s attorney 
general declined to litigate the 
case on behalf of the Republican-
held general assembly, TMLC, 
a 
self-identified 
Christian, 
conservative law firm, took up 
the case.
In July, the Sixth Circuit 
Court denied Tennessee’s case 
on the basis of standing. In 
other words, the plaintiffs had 
not suffered any measurable 
damages 
from 
the 
refugee 
resettlement program.

Joe’s Pizza, an authentic New 
York City establishment, recently 
opened its first location outside 
of the five boroughs on South 
University Avenue. Joining the 
slew of pizza places in town, Joe’s 
aims to provide a new kind of slice 
and experience without usurping 
existing pizzerias.
While Ann Arbor may seem 
like an odd choice for Joe’s first 
out-of-state 
site, 
partner 
and 
manager Peter Levin revealed the 
motivations behind the big move. 
“My business partner Ian and 
I both went to U of M, we’ve been 
friends ever since,” Levin said. “We 
were like, if we’re going to expand 
Joe’s lets do it in Ann Arbor. There’s 
such a great market here, we have 
the obvious ties to Ann Arbor and 
we felt it would be a really great fit.”
Situated in a prime location for 
maximum foot traffic, just across 
from the engineering arch, Levin 
said there was extensive planning 
behind their new venture. 
“We wanted to open an iconic 
location, we plan to be here for a 
really long time, and we wanted a 
location that kids will remember 
after school into the years, and 
we felt that this was it,” he said.

On top of tuition, students at 
the University of Michigan pay 
hundreds of dollars in mandatory 
fees in each of their courses for 
textbooks, 
online 
homework 
and other supplies. With all 
of these extra fees students 
are expected to pay, Central 
Student Government is pursuing 
initiatives to make attending the 
University more affordable for 
students. Some of these initiatives 
include making homework more 
accessible and looking into hiring 
specialists who could help reduce 
costs of class materials. 
Certain schools on campus 
require students to spend an 
additional amount of money 
on supplies and materials for 
their 
classes. 
According 
to 
the Office of the Registrar, for 
instance, materials for 100 and 
200-level courses in the School 
of Art & Design can cost up to 
$250 per course. Courses in 
the LSA department of Film, 
Television, and Media, as well 
as courses in the Taubman 
College of Architecture and 
Urban Planning, can also require 

students pay several hundred 
dollars for supplies. 
Taubman sophomore Olivia 
Howard expressed her concern 
regarding the large amounts of 
money Taubman students have 
to spend on materials for class, 
especially considering the lack 
of communication from certain 
professors about these costs.
“We may not have to get books, 
but supplies for model building, 
drafting and computer software 
are incredibly pricey and a 
necessity for the class,” Howard 
said. “I guess it’s part of the major, 
but it can be a pain to get supplies 
at random intervals throughout 
the semester, especially when it’s 
not mentioned that we need them 
upfront. So students have a hard 
time budgeting for them.”
LSA junior Shira Baron, who is 
also pursuing a dual degree in the 
Art & Design School, spoke about 
her disappointment with the 
financial obligation for students 
in these schools.
“It’s disheartening for students 
because it adds an additional 
financial hurdle and reinforces 
just how expensive this school 
already is,” Baron said.

Local lawyers litigate 
case involving refugee 
Medicaid, states’ rights


In a press conference 
Monday 
afternoon, 
Michigan 
Attorney 
General Dana Nessel and 
Secretary of State Jocelyn 
Benson 
announced 
six 
charges 
filed 
against 
Southfield 
City 
Clerk 
Sherikia L. Hawkins on 
allegations 
of 
election 
fraud.
According 
to 
Nessel, 
the Office of the Attorney 
General 
was 
notified 
of discrepancies in the 
Southfield 
voter 
count 
several days ago by the 
Oakland 
County 
Clerk’s 
office, after efforts were 
made to certify Southfield’s 
absentee 
ballots 
from 
the 
November 
2018 
election. 
Nessel’s 
office 

subsequently worked with 
the department’s Public 
Integrity Unit to verify 
the crimes and determine 
what charges should be 
made. 
“Overall, 
our 
public 
integrity unit ensures that 
any public official or law 
enforcement officer who 
commits a crime in the state 
of 
Michigan, 
regardless 
of position, standing, or 
party affiliation, is held 
accountable,” Nessel said. 
“Protecting our democracy 
is not a partisan issue, 
and our goal is to restore 
the public’s interest in 
honest 
government 
and 
the 
integrity 
of 
public 
officials at all levels of our 
government.”
 Nessel says her office 
ultimately 
filed 
six 
charges against Hawkins, 

including 
Election 
Law 
– 
Falsifying 
Returns, 
Forgery of a Public Record, 
Misconduct 
in 
Office 
and three counts of using 
a 
computer 
to 
commit 
a 
crime. 
Hawkins 
was 
summoned to court this 
morning, and appeared in 
front of Judge Michelle 
Friedman Appel of the 45th 
District for a preliminary 
hearing.
While 
Nessel 
would 
not go into the details 
of the alleged crime, she 
explained the allegations 
involved 
Hawkins 
making unauthorized and 
inaccurate changes to a 
list of absentee voters who 
voted in an election last 
year.
Following 
Nessel’s 
statement, 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Jocelyn 
Benson 
spoke to the response 
made by the Attorney 
General and Secretary 
of State’s offices, as 
well as the severity of 
the alleged crime.
“The 
events 
that 
bring us here today 
are rare,” Benson said. 
“They involve actions 
by a public official 
entrusted 
with 
the 
administration 
of 
elections, and they 
recognize 
that 
our 
elections, 
as 
the 
Attorney 
General 
emphasized, 
are 
the 
foundation 
of 
our democracy. All 
of 
us 
stand 
here 
before you today to 
indicate 
that 
there 
will be no tolerance 
for 
any 
actions 
that 
undermine 
that 
foundation, 
anywhere, 
anytime, 
by 
any 
person 
or 
official.”
While 
Benson 
emphasized 
the 
detrimental 
effects 

of any degree of election 
fraud, she also underscored 
that no election results 
had been influenced or 
jeopardized by Hawkins’ 
alleged actions.
“I want to be clear,” 
she said. “The allegations 
that 
the 
Southfield 
clerk 
falsified 
official 
election records did not 
alter the outcome of any 
election. There were no 
races that were won or 
lost as a result and there 
were no voters who were 
disenfranchised.”
Neither 
Nessel 
nor 
Benson 
would 
speak 
to 
the 
motivations 
for 
Hawkins’ alleged crime. 
Benson 
explained 
that 
while 
Hawkins’ 
actions 
are 
being 
investigated, 
the Southfield City Clerk’s 
office will work jointly 
with the attorney general’s 
office to administer local 
elections coming up in 
November.
According to Benson, the 
investigation carried out 
by both her and Nessel’s 
departments 
confirms 
Michigan’s commitment to 
free and fair elections.
“What 
today’s 
announcement 
also 
underscores 
is 
that 
in 
Michigan, 
our 
elections 
are 
secure,” 
she 
said. 
“It’s important to note 
that 
when 
there 
are 
allegations of misconduct, 
we act swiftly to ensure 
they are addressed and 
justice is served, and in 
fact it is because of our 
vigorous series of checks 
and balances, including a 
very detailed 14-day post-
election 
canvas 
process 
designed 
to 
confirm 
election results in every 
precinct that we uncovered 
this potential misconduct.”

Senior Social Media Editor: Allie Phillips 


TMD: What are you most 
looking forward to in this new 
position?
AC: There isn’t one answer 
to that question. I think one of 
the things I’m really looking 
forward to is trying to make 
sure that people understand the 
value of a liberal arts education 
and the life possibilities that 
that brings up as well as the 
impact of the research that we 
do in LSA. That research has an 
impact on some of the world’s 
biggest problems, from climate 
change and sustainability, to 
mass incarceration, to the digital 
world in which we now live, 
to race relations. The work we 
do matters for those questions 
and the education we provide 
is preparing students for that 
world and allowing students 
to be a part of that research 
mission, and that to me is one of 
the really exciting things.
I’m excited to connect with 
students. LSA — we have over 
17,000 
undergraduates, 
we 
have over 2,500 grad students. 
I have been a teacher for over 
20 years. I love spending time 
with students. I feel deeply 
lucky that I have committed 
my life to spending time with 
young people and with students 
… What we need to do is to be 
talking with students because 
my sense, and this is from years 
and years of conversations with 
students, is that our priorities 
are aligned and to think about 
how we partner given that we 
have aligned priorities on many, 
many things.
I’m excited to think about 
think 
about 
some 
possibly 
changes 
in 
undergraduate 
education. 
I 
co-chaired 
a 
task 
force 
for 
the 
provost 
that was called the Future of 
Undergraduate 
Education 
at 
the University of Michigan in 
the Third Century … It was a 
remarkable 
committee, 
and 
we spent over a year and a half 
working on this project and came 
up with some very exciting ideas 
for ways forward in thinking 
about undergraduate education. 
One of the last things I’d say 
is I’m excited to stay focused on 

innovation, on making sure we 
get the chance to explore new 
questions both big and small, that 
students are going to be involved 
in asking those questions, and 
that we never lose sight of the 
fact that as we do rigorous, 
challenging research, there is joy 
in that. We should talk about the 
joy of discovery and the play of 
it. Sometimes the best questions 
come out of play with ideas, and 
those are words that I like to use 
when we talk about the mission 
of this place.
TMD: You recently hosted 
a pop-up event to introduce 
yourself 
to 
students. 
Deans 
often have less contact with 
students than professors or other 
University staff members. How 
do you envision your relationship 
with students in this role?
AC: I will continue to spend 
a lot of time with students. 
Students are the heartbeat of 
this place, and they have been 
an inspiration to me throughout 
my career. They have made 
me a better teacher, they have 
shaped my research and I learn 
from students. I’m a linguist 
and I track how the language 
changes. As linguists will often 
say, young people are the movers 
and shakers of language change, 
so I actually feel very lucky to get 
to hang out with the movers and 
shakers of language change.
I will get back into the 
classroom to some extent in 
the next few years because 
the energy of that space is 
irreplaceable, so I will find ways 
— they’ll be more limited — but 
ways to be in the classroom, and 
I’ve been meeting with student 
leaders already to talk about 
what student groups are doing 
and to figure out where can we 
partner, where are our missions 
aligned 
and 
starting 
those 
conversations early. I would 
welcome any and all student 
leaders who want to meet with 
me to contact me, because I love 
meeting with students and I 
want to start those conversations 
early.
TMD: Before taking this role, 
you previously served as the 
Associate Dean of Humanities. 
How do you plan to bring this 
background into LSA’s wide-
reaching scope?
AC: I spent four years as the 
Associate Dean of Humanities, 

and one of the real joys as 
someone 
who’s 
curious, 
of 
being in the dean’s office, was 
getting to understand the scope 
of the college beyond my own 
department and beyond the 
humanities. So I’m the associate 
dean for humanities, but I’m 
sitting in the room discussing 
the entire scope of the college: 
the 
humanities, 
the 
social 
sciences, the natural sciences, 
all of undergraduate education. 
That started to give me a sense 
of the scope of this place. I loved 
thinking about the different 
methods people are using, the 
different 
kinds 
of 
research 
people are doing, different ways 
to think about impact. As you 
move across the college the 
impact of our scholarship looks 
different.
One of my jobs was to make sure 
that people could understand the 
importance of the humanities, 
why 
the 
humanities 
matter 
both for people’s education and 
why our research matters, and 
now I feel like I have this really 
exciting opportunity to broaden 
the scope of that and say now my 
job is to explain why the liberal 
arts matter and how that kind of 
education and how the research 
across the breadth of what we do 
matters.
TMD: Last semester, The 
Daily reported on the trend 
of a declining number of 
history majors. Nationally, it 
is considered a time when the 
liberal arts in general is at a 
crossroads. What do you envision 
for the future of LSA? How do 
you plan to engage students in 
the many areas of study housed 
within LSA?
AC: I want students to see 
LSA as a place where they can 
explore fields and questions that 
they had no idea that they could 
explore. I say that in part out of 
my own experience. I started 
college as a math major. I really 
like math, I had been good at 
math. I took the intensive first-
year math course. I also liked 
learning languages, so my first 
year in college I took a linguistics 
course … My sophomore year, 
I took a course on the history 
of the English language and I 
just fell in love. I didn’t even 
know that I wanted to know the 
answers to those questions, and I 
want to know the answers to all 

of those questions. 
I want LSA students to feel 
like they get to explore and 
find the questions that they get 
excited about because that’s 
how we get the best education, 
is suddenly, we’re just curious, 
and this is work that matters to 
us, where we think, ‘I can make a 
difference here. I have things to 
say here. I want to get involved 
with research in this area,’ so 
that is certainly my goal for 
students.
TMD: What do you believe 
LSA’s strengths and weaknesses 
are?
AC: When I look at LSA, the 
things I am deeply impressed 
with are the breadth and depth 
of 
(its) 
excellence. 
That 
is 
unusual. It is unusual even in our 
peer institutions. We continue 
to invest across the natural 
sciences, the social sciences 
and the humanities because we 
believe that they’re all important 
to a rich liberal arts education … 
Another thing I am impressed 
with is we are a top-ranked 
research institution that cares 
deeply 
about 
undergraduate 
teaching, and that matters to 
me. All our faculty are teaching 
undergraduates 
and 
(are) 
committed to that part of being 
at Michigan. 
I’m also really proud of our 
commitment to Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion. This is something 
where we’ve done a lot of 
really important work. There’s 
more work to do and we’re 
committed to continuing to do 
that in a thoughtful, sustained, 
committed way … We’ll continue 
to do work around helping 
students connect their liberal 
arts education to where they 
want to go next. That, to me, is 
one of the really exciting things 
we’re working on …
Another place where we’ll 
continue to do work is thinking 
about well-being, and that’s for 
all members of our community 
so that this can be a place where 
people feel like they can do 
their best work. Here, I’ll think 
particularly about students. We 
hear from students the pressure 
and stress and anxiety they are 
experiencing is getting in the 
way of learning. 

For certain students receiving 
financial 
aid, 
the 
University 
provides allowances for mandatory 
additional course materials. Art 
& Design students in need of this 
monetary aid receive $939, and 
Taubman students receive $708, 
while all other undergraduate 
students receive $524 per semester.
Though the University provides 
monetary compensation for those 
students who qualify for the aid, 
students who do not meet the 
requirements for the necessary 
amount must pay for the supplies 
themselves. 
CSG Vice President Isabelle 
Blanchard, LSA senior, said CSG is 
making affordability on campus a 
priority this year. She also discussed 
open-source programs, which are 
publically accessible programs for 
students. 
“If we could get the whole 
University 
to 
switch 
to 
free, 
open-source programs, then they 
won’t have to pay for these out of 
financial aid, and maybe then they 
can use that financial aid money to 
support more students in general,” 
Blanchard said. “They won’t have 
to pay as much for these supply 
allowances.”
Other 
courses 
on 
campus 
— especially in STEM fields — 
have extra registration fees for 
digital learning systems on which 
students are expected to complete 
homework and quizzes. According 
to Blanchard, the homework access 
code for one of her physics courses 
cost $70.
“I feel like the University should 
work harder to provide these 
resources or at least look into options 
that are more affordable … just so 
that it’s not all coming from the 
students directly,” Blanchard said. 
“I do think while some students can 
afford them, it’s definitely a barrier 
to entry. It can kind of scare people 
away from doing certain programs, 
or you can just easily fall behind too 
if you can’t buy it right away at the 
beginning of the semester.”
Some of her other courses on 
campus that use programs that 
require students to pay to access 
homework 
make 
homework 
optional, Blanchard said. However, 
they give extra points for students 

who choose to complete it. 
“In one of my courses, they had 
a program that you could choose to 
pay for if you wanted to get those 
extra points in your grade, but then 
if you don’t want to pay for that 
or you can’t afford it, then that’s 
not fair,” Blanchard said. “You’re 
not getting those points that other 
students could get.” 
In an attempt to help reduce 
these additional costs for students 
who do not qualify for an allowance 
provided by the University, CSG 
has been pursuing several different 
initiatives, 
according 
to 
CSG 
President Ben Gerstein.
Gerstein suggested some steps 
that need to be taken include direct 
communication with departments 
to better understand why there 
is an added fee, and whether the 
programs in question offer a value 
that is interchangeable a different 
program that is less expensive. 
Additionally, 
he 
recommended 
trying to figure out what solutions 
can be worked on with professors 
and programs to limit costs. 
Specifically, CSG is working to 
expand its Academic Affairs Task 
Force, a project dedicated toward 
reducing 
barriers, 
especially 
financial ones, to students’ academic 
success.
“I welcome students to get 
involved in the Academic Affairs 
Task Force,” Gerstein said. “It’s 
open to any student who wants to 
get involved, and so, if students are 
interested in how to improve this 
— because it’s a very real problem 
— we want to hear their stories and 
their voices and make sure that 
their perspectives are heard in the 
policies that we pursue and in the 
changes that we aim to make.”
The 
additional 
costs 
for 
materials and online programs are 
different for each course and each 
department. 
CSG is suggesting the University 
hire specialists who would be 
able to consult the departments 
and provide a more cost-effective 
alternative to the current programs 
and methods these courses use. 
According to Blanchard, certain 
professors were concerned about 
the monetary feasibility of hiring 
these specialists.

As Judge S. Thomas Anderson 
of the Sixth Circuit put it, 
Tennessee’s 
damages 
were 
“speculative,” and only contingent 
upon the state not adhering to 
federal statute. 
“They just basically said, ‘Well, 
the general assembly does not 
have a right to bring the lawsuit 
in the first place,’” Richard 
Thompson, TMLC’s president and 
chief counsel, said in an interview 
with The Daily. 
In early September, TMLC filed 
a petition for a rehearing by the 
Sixth Circuit, calling their verdict 
“painfully at odds” with the 
Supreme Court precedent. 
Thompson said his organization 
saw the federal government’s 
requirement 
of 
the 
state 
to 
afford refugees Medicaid as an 
infringement on Tennessee’s right 
to spend revenue in a way it sees 
fit.
John 
Bursch, 
the 
former 
Michigan solicitor general and 
founder of Bursch Law PLLC., 
delivered the argument on behalf 
of the plaintiffs in July. In addition 
to crafting TMLC’s case, Bursch 
is currently preparing for a 
separate argument in front of the 
U.S. Supreme Court, defending 
a Michigan funeral home in 
a case regarding transgender 
employment discrimination. 
Bursch said TMLC’s petition 
is based on the 10th Amendment 
precedent that grants the states 
any powers not expressly given to 
the federal government. 
“The petition for rehearing 
en banc asks whether a state 
legislature has the ability to bring 
a lawsuit to challenge an action 
by the federal government that 
interferes with the legislature’s 
authority,” Bursch said in an 
email interview Friday. “Here, the 
federal government has compelled 
the State of Tennessee to pay for a 
program from which Tennessee 
has withdrawn.”
TMLC’s case has generated 
controversy 
from 
immigrants’ 
rights advocates in the area. 
Law student Kerry Martin, an 
immigration representative at the 
Michigan Immigration and Labor 
Law Association, says Tennessee’s 

use of the 10th Amendment as a 
basis to nullify an order from the 
federal government is invalid.
“There’s a lot of ways the federal 
government can use its power 
to affect what the states do,” 
Martin said. “They’re definitely 
not independent entities. But 
there are some areas where if the 
federal government coerces or 
commandeers state power, quote 
unquote, then that comes into 
violation.”
LSA senior Ayah Kutmah, 
co-president of the Michigan 
Refugee Assistance Program, said 
helping refugees resettle benefits 
the states they moved to in the 
long run.
“It’s actually in their best 
interest that they do,” Kutmah 
said. “Now, these refugees are able 
to actually integrate into society 
and become able bodied working 
individuals who contribute back 
to society. Obviously, you’re not 
able to do that without any state 
sponsorship, especially medically 
when it comes to health care.”
While the Tennessee case 
has brought TMLC increased 
public attention, the group has 
litigated dozens of cases, notably 
representing several New Jersey 
residents 
who 
opposed 
the 
construction of a mosque and 
Muslim community center in 
Bernards, N.J. The organization 
is a nonprofit and received $1.6 
million in private donations last 
year.
Also central in the creation 
of the organization was Tom 
Monaghan, 
Domino’s 
Pizza 
founder and former Detroit Tigers 
owner, who has been involved in 
various 
other 
Christian-based 
ventures, including the foundation 
of Ave Maria College in Ypsilanti, 
Ave Maria School of Law in Naples, 
Florida, and even a Florida town 
based in Catholic values, currently 
under development. 
“Most of our cases deal outside 
the state of Michigan, they’re 
mostly in federal courts, although 
we’re located in Ann Arbor 
township at the Domino’s Farms 
complex,” Thompson said. “We do 
get involved in a lot of, I would say, 
controversial cultural issues.”
TMLC is not Ann Arbor’s only 
self-identified 
Judeo-Christian-
interest law firm — the local 
American Freedom Law Center 

made headlines earlier this year 
for being placed on the Southern 
Poverty Law Center’s annual “hate 
map” of American organizations 
classified as hate groups.
Thompson is familiar with the 
organization, and said the group’s 
co-founder, 
Michigan 
lawyer 
Robert Muise, was formerly a 
senior trial counsel at TMLC for 12 
years, before founding the AFLC 
with lawyer David Yerushalmi.
Kutmah said she was not 
entirely surprised to hear of 
conservative Christian law firms 
based in Ann Arbor.
“A lot of people might think and 
say, ‘Oh, Ann Arbor is liberal bubble 
in the Midwest,’ or something 
like that but these bubbles are not 
uniform,” Kutmah said. “There’s 
always going to be actors or 
organizations or things that might 
display an interest in or lobby for 
things that are against what the 
general people (support)... I don’t 
think it’s necessarily just because 
we associate a state or a city as 
having one type of ideology that 
everyone in there is uniform.”
In 
its 
role 
representing 
Tennessee, 
TMLC’s 
legal 
argument takes issue with more 
than overuse of federal power. The 
Tennessee lawsuit refers to the 
Refugee Resettlement Act of 1980, 
a law that was crafted to create 
a uniform system for admitting 
refugees into the United States. 
At the time, many immigrants 
from South Asia and the Soviet 
Union 
were 
seeking 
asylum, 
and the new policy would allow 
one refugee to resettle in an 
area for every 4,000 Americans. 
TMLC labels the bill as an 
unconstitutional abuse of power, 
allowing the federal government 
to 
commandeer 
funds 
for 
resettlement from the states.
Michigan 
Immigration 
and Labor Law Association’s 
Martin noted that other lawsuits 
have argued about the federal 
government’s right to withhold 
funding, including the 1987 case 
of South Dakota v. Dole, where 
the court upheld the federal 
government’s ability to block funds 
for a state’s highway construction 
and maintenance if the state 
would not raise the drinking age to 
21. Martin says a similar precedent 
for federal spending power was set 
several years ago, and involved the 

passage of the Affordable Care Act, 
often referred to as Obamacare. 
According 
to 
Martin, 
this 
precedent makes it difficult for 
Tennessee to build a viable case on 
the basis of the 10th Amendment.
“Absolutely the government 
can use its Medicaid spending 
to require that states receiving 
federal Medicaid funds pass those 
funds on to resettled refugees,” 
Martin said.
But for all of Tennessee’s 
opposition 
to 
Medicaid 
expenditures, the state stands to 
lose far more by not complying, 
Martin said. Should the state not 
provide Medicaid to resettled 
refugees, a March 2018 ruling 
from the federal court in Jackson, 
Tennessee estimated it could lose 
up to $7 billion annually in federal 
health care funds.
“They listed in their lawsuit, 
this is their big complaint, the 
state of Tennessee: that we 
have to pay $20 million towards 
refugee Medicaid expenses in 
addition to some other expenses 
like, God forbid, interpreters in 
the public schools,” Martin said. 
“$20 million. This is a state with a 
massive budget.”
Additionally, Martin argues in 
the wake of the Resettlement Act, 
Tennessee had few or no objections 
to taking in asylum seekers, often 
from Eastern Europe or the Soviet 
Union. He says this fact alone 
hints that Tennessee and TMLC’s 
fervent opposition to the inflow 
of refugees is based on more than 
just paying for their Medicaid 
expenses. 
“You’ve lived with this law 
until, what, the year 2017?” Martin 
said. “37 years. And now you’re 
saying this is a commandeering of 
your funds?”
Kutmah said prejudice often 
plays a role in some of the rhetoric 
used to describe refugees.
“For 
humanitarian 
reasons, 
I think it’s morally atrocious 
that you’re closing a door on a 
threatened group of people,” 
Kutmah said. “... (Refugees) are 
what make these communities 
vibrant, provide the jobs that 
are needed. Again, like you have 
the added cultural heritage and 
diversity, which always increase 
the 
economic 
and 
cultural 
strength of any city or state.”

A limit of 28 of each facility 
would 
be 
allowed 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, adding up to a total of 84 
recreational marijuana retailers 
that would each cost $5,000.
A 
10 
percent 
renewable 
energy requirement would also 
be required in each facility. 
Lenart said this requirement 
would help alleviate the energy 
demand recreational marijuana 
businesses often require.
“A lot of communities that are 
further ahead in the revolution 
of marijuana law and business 
facilities have had significant 
challenges 
with 
energy 
consumption 
and 
demand,” 
Lenart said. “We believe that 
this is a reasonable step towards 
trying to mitigate some of those 
factors.”
Following 
Lenart, 
Kristen 
Larcom, senior assistant aity 
attorney, explained amendments 
to permit ordinances to council 
members. Larcom said the city 
plans to enact very minimal 
changes.
“What we have tried to do is 
make as few changes as we need 
to and just incorporate adult use 
marijuana into the framework 
we already have for medical 
marijuana,” Larcom said.
Deputy City Attorney Kevin 
McDonald 
then 
covered 
the 
permit 
application 
process. 
He said the city would choose 
applications 
for 
recreational 
marijuana businesses that would 
be in best compliance with the 
state’s laws. 
“If the state received more 
applications than the city is 
allowing, it really turns to the 
city to make the decision as to 
which applications it is supposed 
to actually issue,” McDonald said. 
“It’s supposed to be a somewhat 
objective procedure so that we 
can very quickly come up with 
the applications that should rise 
to the top of the pack.”
Applications will be scored 
on four 25-point categories: past 
performance and experience in 
the community, business plan and 
state compliance, location and 
community interest. Those that 
score best on this grading scale 
will be granted permits until the 

threshold is met.
Jane 
Lumm, 
I-Ward 
2, 
expressed 
concern 
regarding 
the new ordinances. She said 
she felt the process to approve 
permits is being rushed to come 
into effect at the same time the 
state begins to accept applications 
for 
commercial 
recreational 
marijuana facilities Nov. 1.
“This is a really big deal,” 
Lumm 
said. 
“Recreational 
marijuana is obviously coming, 
and we’re setting regulations that 
determine how many facilities 
there can be, where they can be 
located, how they can operate.”
Lumm 
advised 
studying 
what Boulder, Colo., and other 
similar communities have done 
to monitor marijuana, such as 
creating a marijuana advisory 
board. She said she will be asking 
for a temporary opt-out when the 
ordinance comes around for a 
second reading.
“We work for the residents, 
and I’m concerned about the 
real impacts on them and our 
community,” Lumm said. “I’m 
more concerned about that then 
perceived messages.”
Ali Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, said he 
takes a different position on the 
ordinances than Lumm. He said 
he believes the council is listening 
to 
community 
members 
and 
approving the ordinances will be 
an economic benefit to Ann Arbor.
“This 
is 
something 
that 
has been talked about in our 
community, in our state and in 
our country for a very long time,” 
Ramlawi said. “I think we are 
doing our diligence.”
The 
council 
members 
also 
discussed 
concerns 
with regulations on smoking 
marijuana outside. Julie Grand, 
D-Ward 3, questioned the current 
laws in place regarding smoking 
marijuana 
outside, 
and 
Jeff 
Hayner, D-Ward 1, asked about 
how this regulation would be 
implemented.
Hayner also supported the idea 
of a marijuana advisory board. As 
a member of the liquor advisory 
committee, he said a similar 
board for recreational marijuana 
businesses would be a great 
aspect to add to the ordinances.

Keep mental illness out of your criticism
E

arlier 
this 
month, 
Democratic 
presidential 
candidate 
Sen. 
Kamala 
Harris, 
D-Calif., 
found 
herself 
under criticism for laughing and 
responding “well said” to a voter’s 
question in which they referred to 
President Donald Trump’s actions 
as “mentally retarded.” Harris has 
since apologized, stating that she had 
not heard these specific comments 
and “that word and others like it 
aren’t acceptable. Ever.” Despite the 
apology, this moment reveals a larger 
societal issue at hand: the widespread 
use of terms relating to mental 
illness to discredit an opponent or to 
otherwise put others down. 
In their criticisms of Trump, 
many of his detractors have levied 
accusations 
of 
mental 
illness 
against 
him. 
The 
left-leaning 
political website Vox referred to 
him as “crazy” in a headline, while 
sports and political commentator 
Keith Olbermann has referred to 
the president as a “psychopath” on 
Twitter. Some have even gone as far 
as to diagnose him with different 
psychological disorders, including 
narcissistic 
personality 
disorder 
and dementia. These comments 
continue to be made, despite the 
absence of any legitimate medical 
diagnosis made public by the Trump 
administration. 
Criticism directed towards an 
individual’s actions on the basis of 
a mental illness is not unfounded. 
Indeed, Trump has engaged in 
many 
questionable, 
damaging 
and puzzling behaviors. However, 
unsubstantiated claims of mental 
illness are harmful to greater society 
as a whole. Regardless of how one 
feels about the president and his 
actions, allegations of mental illness 
and uninformed “diagnoses” of 
different disorders perpetuate the 
stigma of those living with legitimate 
mental illnesses. The use of terms like 
“crazy,” “insane” or “psychopath” 
to discredit someone’s professional 
capacities perpetuate the idea that 
people with mental illnesses are 
incompetent, dangerous, unstable 

or weak. This stigma is ubiquitous 
in American society. When typically 
well-respected 
figures 
such 
as 
politicians or journalists levy mental 
illness accusations to discredit an 
opponent, the stigma is just enabled 
to spread farther and become more 
deeply ingrained. Out of fear of being 
labeled as crazy, some mentally ill 
Americans do not seek treatment for 
their disorders. This trend goes on to 
worsen the suffering and persistence 
of symptoms associated with mental 
health.
Whenever a critic calls upon 
a mental diagnosis to invalidate 
President Trump’s actions, they 
are perpetuating the stigma that 
those with mental illnesses are 
individuals less capable of leading 
productive lives and are a threat to 
society. In fact, Dr. Allen Francis, 
the former head of Duke University’s 
Psychiatry Department, appeared 
on CNN to denounce the misuse of 
psychological terms as criticisms 
of behavior. He said that the 
combination 
of 
accusations 
of 
mental illness and politics can have 
dire consequences for the general 
public, mainly because it stigmatizes 
the mentally ill, who are often 
“well-behaved, well-mannered, and 
good people.” Moreover, he stated 
that “lumping the mentally ill with 
Trump is a terrible insult to the 
mentally ill and they have enough 
problems and stigma as it is.” In their 
efforts to criticize political strategies 
and policies they do not agree with, 
these individuals are unintentionally 
targeting the millions of Americans 
living with a mental illness.
The pejorative use of mental 
illnesses 
and 
terms 
associated 
with them extends far beyond the 
Trump administration. American 
psychiatrists are governed by The 
Goldwater 
Rule, 
barring 
them 
from providing their opinion on 
the mental state of individuals they 
have not personally evaluated under 
their own medical care. The rule 
itself stems from a 1964 libel suit 
by Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., 
against a magazine. The magazine 

had printed an opinion compiled 
by more than 1,000 psychiatrists 
stating that Senator Goldwater was 
mentally unfit for office. Though 
this particular case is over 50 years 
old, the American Psychiatric 
Association maintains it is still 
relevant today. This practice is not 
in place solely to avoid lawsuits. 
Psychiatrists worry that frequent 
unsubstantiated claims of mental 
illness 
without 
any 
physical 
evidence will undermine their 
profession, making clients with 
legitimate diagnoses of mental 
disorders less likely to trust them 
for medical treatment. The cavalier 
usage of medical terms pertaining 
to mental illness cheapens the daily 
struggle faced by the mentally 
ill and in turn delegitimizes the 
treatment process. By doing so, 
patients who already deal with the 
often isolating effects of mental 
illness furthermore feel as though 
they have no resources to help them 
deal with such issues. 
Beyond the realm of politics, 
the colloquial use of mental illness 
in vocabulary continues to have 
harmful effects. Many psychological 
disorders have entered the common 
vernacular as nouns to describe 
different unusual behaviors or 
idiosyncrasies 
in 
individuals. 
Instances such as referring to a 
propensity for neatness as “OCD,” 
changes in demeanor as “bipolar” or 
an occasional inability to concentrate 
as “ADHD” are very common. While 
it is unlikely that people use these 
terms to intentionally diminish the 
very real symptoms of mental illness, 
language is integral to shaping how 
we understand the world. Whether it 
is high-profile politicians seemingly 
condoning the use of slurs against 
people with disabilities, criticisms 
of the president or simple everyday 
conversation, using mental illnesses 
in a casual manner hurts everyone, 
most importantly those struggling 
with such disorders themselves.

Stop salivating your genetic privacy away
I 

was first exposed to the 
concept of genetic testing 
companies in a Biology 172 
lecture my freshman year. The 
professor at that time stated, 
“This was one of the things I fear 
most about revolutionary genetic 
technology.” 
Since the late 2000s, 23andMe 
has emerged in a brand new field of 
accessible genetic testing. Individuals 
can simply buy a $99 ancestry kit or 
$199 ancestry and health kit from 
the 
company’s 
website, 
deposit 
their saliva into a vial, send it in and 
wait for the results. The company 
can then look at thousands of 
microscopic regions of your DNA 
or sites in your genome. At first, this 
was for discovering quirky traits 
that indicated you were genetically 
predisposed to have flat feet, hair 
photobleaching, motion sickness, a 
unibrow, etc. There isn’t any inherent 
issue with this, but this phase of 
interest did not last long because there 
is much more intriguing information 
to extract from your DNA.
23andMe soon began including 
purchasable packages that would 
allow the consumer to know if they 
were a carrier of certain potentially 
life-changing traits. The “Health 
Predisposition report,” found on 
23andMe’s website, includes results 
for the BRCA1/BRCA2 gene, Celiac 
Disease, 
late-onset 
Alzheimer’s, 
Type II diabetes and more. The 
genomic regions up for analytics are 
often telltale signs of the impending 
onset of metabolic diseases or 
increased risks for breast cancer, 
among hundreds of other examples. 
However, 
any 
product 
that 
is intended by the company as a 
way of preventing or diagnosing 
a disease needs to be deemed safe 
and effective by the Food and Drug 
Administration. So when 23andMe 
shifted their marketing ploy closer 
to diagnoses and individual health 
knowledge, the FDA stepped in. 
In July 2012, the company finally 
began the process of obtaining 
clearance from the FDA to sell the 
kit they had been selling since 2007. 
Fast forward another six years 
to Oct. 31, 2018, when the FDA 
finally “authorize(d) first direct-to-
consumer test for detecting genetic 
variants that may be associated with 
medication metabolism.” The FDA 
recognized that consumers were 
increasingly interested in using 
genetic information to help make 
decisions about their health care, 
but they also pushed that these tests 
needed to be designed in a way that 

still heavily encouraged consumers 
to seek out medical care by a licensed 
physician or health care provider and 
to confirm problematic test results 
using 
clinical 
pharmacogenetic 
testing. 
However, the FDA is missing 
the point. The purchasable options 
23andMe provides are not primarily 
intended to be utilized as medical 
devices, which was the FDA’s cause 
of concern. The kits offered are 
façades for an immense gathering of 
personal information that is taking 
place directly under the noses of 
those who participate. Doesn’t sound 
like a big deal? Perhaps collecting 
the DNA of thousands of consumers, 
analyzing 
their 
genomes 
and 
learning what traits and diseases they 
are disposed to is not particularly 
scary. The problem arises when this 
information is stored within the 
company’s databases permanently. 
Once this information is gathered, it 
could potentially be made available 
to 
pharmaceutical 
companies, 
insurance brokers, employers or 
family 
members. 
Your 
genetic 
information could be used against 
you and is just another step towards 
the total infringement of privacy. 
Think 
about 
huge 
search 
engines like Google. The amount 
of 
information 
stored 
within 
their databases exceeds numbers 
comprehensible to a normal human 
being. Every search query entered 
into the Google search engine 
is stored, right along with the 
individually identifiable information 
oozing from everyone’s laptops and 
networks. This massive store of data 
has undoubtedly become Google’s 
best asset over time. Patrick Chung, 
a board member of 23andMe, 
stated, “Once you have the data, (the 
company) does actually become the 
Google of personalized health care.” 
Eerily analogous to Google’s growth, 
Chung also mentions that “the long 
game here is not to make money 
selling kits, although the kits are 
essential to get the base level data,” 
the goal of 23andMe is to create 
and sustain mass data-gathering 
operations.
There are many pros and cons to 
a database full of millions of human 
genomes. Co-founder of 23andMe 
Anne Wojcicki stated, “I want 25 
million people. Once you get 25 
million people, there’s just a huge 
power of what types of discoveries 
you can make. Big data is going to 
make us all healthier.” 
When you think about hospitals, 
pharmaceutical 
companies 
and 

even the government, genetic 
information on a monumentally 
accessible scale is very likely 
to be an excessively valuable 
commodity. Of course, you consent 
to give your genetic information 
away. You buy the kit, deposit 
your spit in the vial and mail it in 
for analysis. Maybe you read the 
privacy policies, stating that they 
implement measures to ensure 
confidentiality and integrity of 
23andMe data and they do not 
share customer data with any 
public 
databases. 
Specifically, 
23andMe states they “will not sell, 
lease, or rent your individual-level 
information to any third party 
without your explicit consent.” 
Revisiting the Google analogy, 
we’ve all heard 23andMe’s pledge 
before. In the online world of 
storing 
personal 
information, 
companies that strive to obtain 
individually identifying data do not 
deeply care about consent, whether 
it be explicit or implicit. While the 
FDA focuses on whether or not 
the kits produced by 23andMe are 
safe, they fail to address the issue 
looming over all of our heads: What 
are they doing with all the data? 
Think about your relatives: 
There is probably one aunt, uncle, 
cousin or grandparent who has 
sent in their vial of spit. Even if 
you haven’t, the company on the 
receiving end has valuable genetic 
information about you through 
the participation of blood relatives. 
You never consented to handing 
over your genomic information. 
You may be heavily uncomfortable 
with that idea. Things could be 
discovered that you didn’t want 
to know and this knowledge could 
add vast amounts of anxiety to your 
life. Someone could eventually use 
this data against you: insurance 
companies could deny you for a pre-
existing health condition, same with 
employers. Surprisingly, 23andMe’s 
terms of service even states if you 
are “asked by an insurance company 
whether you have learned Genetic 
Information about health conditions 
and you do not disclose this to them, 
this may be considered to be fraud.” 
Ironically enough, they also 
include that “Genetic Information 
you share with others could be used 
against your interests. You should be 
careful about sharing your genetic 
information with others.” 
Except for them, naturally.

O

n Dec. 7, 2015, Justin 
Trudeau stood in front of 
the Canadian Parliament 
and 
delivered 
his 
first speech as Prime 
Minister of Canada. 
For Trudeau, the sky 
seemed to be the limit: 
At the young age of 
43, he had helped the 
Liberal 
Party 
win 
back the government 
for the first time in 
nearly a decade, come 
into office with an 
impressive 63 percent 
approval rating and 
promised ambitious government 
reforms, 
including 
more 
transparency and accountability. 
However, 
fast-forward 
to 
today, and things look radically 
different for Trudeau. In a political 
system where incumbent prime 
ministers are strong favorites, 
Trudeau finds himself struggling. 
His Liberals are neck-and-neck 
with 
the 
rival 
Conservative 
Party, and his approval rating 
has dropped into the 20s. As 
with 
most 
political 
issues, 
there is no single component of 
Trudeau’s government to blame. 
Instead, 
Trudeau’s 
struggles 
can be attributed to a multitude 
of factors, most importantly 
his inability to live up to his 
self-created 
political 
brand, 
combined with his vacillating 
positions on climate change.
To begin, it is important 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
while 
Trudeau’s 
government 
is 
obviously far from perfect, it 
has still accomplished a great 
deal in certain areas. One of 
Trudeau’s 
campaign 
pledges 
was to create a gender-balanced 
cabinet comprised of 15 men 
and 15 women, a promise he 
ultimately 
followed 
through 
with. Additionally, while his 
environmental record is far from 
perfect, he has still shown some 
effort to improve environmental 
policy.
Outside 
of 
pure 
politics, 
Trudeau 
has 
also 
been 
enormously effective at crafting 
his personal image, something 
which plays to his strengths. 
Similar to former President 
Barack Obama in the U.S., 
Trudeau worked hard to brand 
himself as a liberal politician 
for the modern era: hip, cool 
and charismatic, with a strong 
social media presence and a 
focus on political values held by 
young people, like diversity and 
environmentalism. For Trudeau, 
this branding was enormously 
effective. His aforementioned 
gender-balanced 
ministerial 
cabinet, his Bhangra-dancing 
and sari-wearing when he visited 
India and his consistent presence 
at 
Canadian 
Pride 
festivals 
are just some examples of how 
well he’s marketed himself as a 
charismatic liberal figure. 
Additionally, 
America’s 
election 
of 
Donald 
Trump 
in 2016 turned Trudeau into 
something of a liberal icon, with 
his good looks, sharp dressing 
and eloquent speeches making 
him a natural foil to America’s 
president. 

Unfortunately for Trudeau, his 
strong personal image is actually 
at the heart of his struggles. 
In 
many 
ways, 
Trudeau’s image has 
actually 
been 
too 
effective, ultimately 
hindering 
him 
once 
real 
political 
concerns are present. 
While 
Trudeau’s 
brand 
represents 
ambitious 
ideas 
and liberal values, 
government politics, 
gridlock and electoral 
concerns have often 
forced him to deviate from his 
stated goals, most likely leaving 
progressive 
Canadian 
voters 
frustrated and disappointed.

Trudeau’s failure to live up to 
his own political hype has been 
apparent in his environmental 
policies. Throughout his tenure 
as 
prime 
minister, 
Trudeau 
has laid out ambitious and far-
reaching 
plans 
for 
fighting 
climate change, and he received 
worldwide 
attention 
for 
his 
proactive role in the negotiation 
of the Paris climate accord. After 
President Trump pulled the U.S. 
out of the Paris climate accord 
in 2017, Trudeau even issued a 
thinly-veiled rebuke, saying, “for 
our part, Canada will continue to 
fight for the global plan that has 
a realistic chance of countering 
it. We have a responsibility to 
future generations and we will 
uphold it.”
However, in contrast with his 
stated goals, Trudeau’s actual 
environmental measures have 
been subdued and disappointing. 
The most glaring example of 
this came in spring 2018, when 
Trudeau’s government decided to 
nationalize the Trans Mountain 
Pipeline for $4.5 billion CSD 
to ensure it was expanded. 
The pipeline, originally built 
in the 1950s, carries oil from 
tar sands in northern Alberta 
to Canada’s west coast, and is 
seen by liberals as an inhibitor 
of Canada’s efforts to become a 
leader in renewable energy and 
environmental activism. Despite 
those issues, and protests from 
First Nations groups over the 
potential concern of oil spills 
on their land, Trudeau went 
ahead 
with 
the 
purchase. 
Though Trudeau’s (somewhat 
convoluted) 
explanation 
for 
nationalizing the pipeline is that 
if Canada can produce more oil, 
it can make more money and 
therefore invest more heavily 
in renewables, it is also likely 

a political move. The pipeline 
provides a number of jobs in 
Alberta, a place where Trudeau 
is historically quite unpopular 
but would like to garner more 
support. Just last week, Trudeau 
skipped a ministerial debate to 
hold the second rally of his 2019 
campaign in Edmonton. 
Unfortunately for Trudeau, 
issues like his environmental 
policies and his mishandling of 
the SNC-Lavalin scandal, which 
ended with the resignation of 
one of his government ministers, 
have emboldened a swath of 
leftist voters who believe he is 
not sufficiently dedicated to his 
stated goals. Both of Canada’s 
other influential leftist parties, 
the 
New 
Democratic 
Party 
(polling around 13 percent for 
the upcoming election) and the 
Green Party (polling around 
10 
percent) 
have 
released 
statements 
demanding 
the 
Canadian government take a 
more aggressive position in the 
fight against climate change. 
The NDP even called Trudeau 
out by name over his proposed 
carbon tax reforms, saying in 
an April 2019 press release, 
“Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau’s 
Liberals have failed to bring the 
provinces together in support 
of a federal carbon tax. At the 
same time, they are asking 
everyday Canadians to do more, 
while practically eliminating the 
carbon tax for some of our biggest 
polluters.”
Ultimately, Trudeau’s problem 
is not that he’s been a bad prime 
minister. Instead, his issue is 
actually that he branded himself 
too effectively, creating hype 
around 
ambitious 
proposals 
which he was ultimately unable 
to follow through on. Thanks 
to this predicament, Trudeau 
has faced attacks from the right 
(he is still a Liberal PM, after 
all) and left, with many liberal 
voters feeling disenchanted with 
Trudeau’s inability to implement 
his lofty goals. 
Trudeau’s image crisis has 
been compounded in recent days 
by a series of revelations about 
his usage of blackface in his 
younger years, something which 
points to a similar problem, but 
on a larger scale: While carefully 
working to portray himself in 
one way, Trudeau has covered 
up or failed to take responsibility 
for actions which go against his 
self-created brand. In regard 
to his incidents with blackface, 
they undercut his strong rhetoric 
on racial equality and call into 
question his devotion to looking 
good versus taking action, much 
the 
way 
his 
environmental 
rhetoric has been undercut by 
his policies in that sphere. 
Ultimately, 
while 
Trudeau 
is still the narrow favorite in 
Canada’s 
upcoming 
election, 
he finds himself in a radically 
different position than he did four 
years ago, with an onerous tenure 
as prime minister shattering the 
golden boy persona he had so 
carefully cultivated in years prior.

What begins as an almost-threesome ends quickly 
in a cabin full of dead children, each missing an ear. 
This is the gory commencement of “American Horror 
Story: 1984,” the ninth installment in the long-running 
horror anthology series. True to its name, this season 
pays homage to the genre’s roots by harkening back to 
’80s camp slashers like “Friday the 13th.” While it does 
borrow heavily from the Jason movies, that doesn’t 
make the show any less enjoyable.
The show follows five friends from an aerobics 
class in 1984. After one of them — Brooke (Emma 
Roberts, “Scream Queens”) — has a close encounter 
with real-life serial killer, the “Night Stalker” Richard 
Ramirez (Zach Villa, “Destroyer”), she joins the rest 
of the group as they become camp counselors at Camp 

Redwood. The camp had been closed down in 1970, 
due to the grisly murder from the opening scene, but 
has been reopened by one of the survivors. Each mile 
closer to camp gets creepier and creepier, as a strange 
hitchhiker is picked up and a mechanic tells the group 
they’re going to die. Then, of course, the camp killer 
escapes an asylum.
If any of these plot points sound familiar, they’re 
absolutely supposed to. “1984” is not incredibly 
original, but that’s part of its charm. The episode 
embraces and utilizes the tropes of classic horror 
with such panache and mirth that it becomes vividly 
bracing. In fact, the whole episode is appealing. The 
blood is bright red and the show’s intro features roller 
skates, leg warmers and staticky, VHS-style video. 
The show goes to great lengths to commit itself as 
completely as it can to capture the ’80s, and the effort 
pays off. The outfits, the voluminous hair, the cars and 
even the 1984 Olympics are weaved into the narrative 
seamlessly, allowing the show to emit an effortless, 
neon-tinged ambience.
The dialogue is not particularly stellar — and 
neither is the acting — but the show is so engaging and 
glamorous that it easily makes up for it. It doesn’t hurt 
that the soundtrack is good, but a little overhwelming 
at times. Rockwell’s synth-funk classic, “Somebody’s 
Watching Me,” sets the mood disturbingly well as 
the gang heads to camp. The buzzing, synthesized 
ambience makes the show moody and brooding. 
Occasionally, I wish the show would allow viewers 
the opportunity to be scared without music that cues 
them into it.
Be aware, this show is horrifyingly gory. Just as the 
show does not spare on aesthetic, it puts equal effort 
into ensuring there are copious amounts of blood. 
Eye-stabbings, literal body-crushings and hangings 
all make guest appearances as the characters are 
slowly introduced to torment. Not to give too much 
away, but a particular scene involving a suspended 

car is particularly gruesome. It isn’t that the show is 
particularly scary, but it certainly isn’t for those with 
weak stomachs.
The thing that has consistently made “American 
Horror Story” wonderful is the fresh batch of 
horror and tense storylines that get thought up each 
season. However, after “Asylum,” the show’s second 
installment, it became far too invested in itself, took 
itself too seriously and used cheap, disgusting horrors 
to disguise its lack of an interesting plot. “Coven” 
introduced a famed serial killer and slave-torturer 
whose appalling crimes were recreated with a 
disturbing amount of detail, while “Hotel” featured an 
unusual amount of excessive and unexplained torture.
Fortunately, “1984” does away with the unnecessary 
melodrama and vulgarity. The conventional plot, overt 
homages and ridiculous gore work well in the show’s 
favor. “1984” has easily made “American Horror Story” 
fun again. It’s very aware of what it is, and exploits that 

to the fullest. “American Horror Story” is still trying to 
shock you. Only this time, the show has figured it out 
how to, and it means to have fun with it.o shock you. 
Only this time, the show has figured it out how to, and 
it means to have fun with it.

‘American Horror Story: 1984’ is a gross time-turner

MAXWELL SCHWARZ

Almost as quickly as he was announced as a 
new cast member, comedian Shane Gillis was 
promptly fired from Saturday Night Live ahead of 
the show’s 45th season premiere. Gillis was sacked 
from the historic sketch variety show for using 
homophopic, racist and overall offensive language 
as recently as this May. Let me point out first and 
foremost that I am troubled that the firing of a 
bigot like Gillis has taken the spotlight away from 
the first (FIRST!) Chinese-American performer in 
the show’s history: the immensely talented Bowen 
Yang. So before you read my tirade against the 
racist tendencies of “no offense” comedy and the 
white comedy boys who inhabit the controversial 
and toxic space known as stand-up comedy — 
please watch this sketch starring Emma Stone that 
Bowen wrote with my favorite shape, Julio Torres, 
and give him the credit and spotlight he deserves. 
In the most non-apologetic way possible, Gillis 
went to Twitter to non-apologize with this non-
apology: I’m a comedian who pushes boundaries. 
I sometimes miss... I’m happy to apologize to 
anyone who’s actually offended by anything I’ve 
said. What a hunk of bologna. Gillis is not “pushing 
boundaries” with his comedy or his unoriginal 
statement. He is saying “no offense.” 
We live in an era of “no offense” comedy. 
In other words, offensive language and slurs 
shrugged off as a joke. In the Trump Era, this 
kind of bully comedy has taken hold of the public 
and kept them in their grasp with promises 
of fighting political correctness and “pushing 
boundaries.” So, tell me, what about archaic biases 
and chauvinist chimings is “pushing boundaries?” 
What is so cutting edge about antiquated slurs? 
What in the hell is funny about picking on the 
vulnerable for the sake of one’s ego? Why are we 
defending bullies for the sake of bad comedy? 
Some former SNL cast members chimed in on 
the show’s firing of Gillis. Rob Schneider came to 
Gillis’s defense on Twitter saying: I am sorry that 
you had the misfortune of being a cast member 
during this era of cultural unforgiveness where 
comedic misfires are subject to the intolerable 
inquisition of those who never risked bombing on 
stage themselves. Schneider, in defending Gillis 
with the language of a Trump campaign, places 
himself alongside the Prejudice Protectors of 
comedy, the Racist Rangers of humor. How many 

male comedians have to swear that their comedy 
is not offensive rather, inventive, contemporary 
or transgressive? If you have to tell people it’s not 
racist/homophobic/transphobic/anti-semitic/
sexist, it probably is.
On the other hand (and cementing my love 
for him even further), Bill Hader commented on 
Gillis in the most Bill Hader way possible. In a 
red-carpet interview at Sunday’s Emmy’s awards, 
the now two-time Emmy winner, and former SNL 
cast member was asked about Gillis’s firing. At 
first, Hader responded with a simple no comment, 
“No, I have no thoughts on that,” but quickly 
followed with, “I feel like you shouldn’t want to 

hurt anyone’s feelings … I’m never interested in 
upsetting anybody.” Hader exemplifies the good 
in comedy. He made a comedy about an assassin — 
now that is boundary-pushing.
Yes, comedy has always been a craft that 
requires telling something new. Of course, 
humor thrives on fresh perspectives and unique 
observations. Certainly, free speech is everyone’s 
God-given right. But don’t you damn forget that 
making others feel inadequate or hated to get a 
cheap chuckle is unacceptable. Using dried up 
prejudices and calling it boundary-pushing is 
wrong. Making excuses for bullies and handing 
them a microphone, a job at SNL, an awards show, 
a gun or an oval office is no laughing matter.

No offense, offense taken

I love “Downton Abbey.” I love its world, its 
characters, its Britishness, the elegance and feel 
of the time and culture that it resurrects from the 
past. “Downton,” as both a television show and a 
film, is a program that asks you, with the utmost 
politeness and chivalry, to suspend your disbelief 
and give in to its fantasy. If you are willing to give 
in, the experience of watching “Downton Abbey” is 
beyond rewarding. Its world is one I feel very safe 
in — even though the characters certainly have their 
struggles, many of them hilariously melodramatic, 
they always manage to surmount them. It’s an 
incredibly comforting show to watch. 

Given all of this, how am I supposed to review 
the “Downton Abbey” movie based on merit alone, 
without letting my personal love and affection 
for the series taint my impression of it? The more 
I think about it, the more I realize I don’t need to. 
It wouldn’t make sense. The “Downton” movie 
was made for its fans, for the people who watched 
the show and have grown to know and adore its 
characters. I, with total subjectivity, love this movie. 
“Downton Abbey” transitions seamlessly from 
television to film, picking up in 1927, not long after 
the events of the series finale. The marketing for 
the film focuses on the King and Queen’s visit to the 
Downton estate, and how the presence of royalty 

in the house affects both the Crawley family and 
the Downton staff alike. While this royal visit 
does occupy a significant portion of the film’s plot, 
it’s really just an excuse for us to spend more time 
with the characters we love, to see how they have 

continued to grow and change after the end of the 
series. The film feels like another, more expensive 
episode of the TV show, in the best way possible. 
We see Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery, “Godless”) 
finally settled with her husband (Matthew Goode, 
“The Crown”) and a new baby. We see our favorite 
chauffeur Tom Branson (Allen Leech, “Bohemian 
Rhapsody”) find love again in an unexpected place. 
We see husband and wife duo Carson (Jim Carter, 
“The Golden Compass”) and Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis 
Logan, “Lovejoy”) grapple with the uncertainty of 
Downton Abbey’s future.
Given the wholesome, crowd-pleasing nature of 
“Downton Abbey,” it’s hardly a spoiler to reveal that 
everyone in the film gets a happy ending, even the 
butler Thomas Barrow (Rob James-Collier, “The 
Ritual”), a character I went from wholeheartedly 
hating to admiring by the end of the series. This 
isn’t realistic, of course. However, “Downton 
Abbey” isn’t interested in realism. It is the ultimate 
form of escapism, and we all desire and deserve 
an escape from reality from time to time. To know 
that there’s a world, whether it be fictional or not, 
where everyone ends up where they’re supposed to 
be with the people they’re supposed to be with has 
meant a lot to me, and “Downton,” both the show 
and the film, has generously given me a world like 
that to escape to. Even if real life doesn’t work out as 
perfectly as “Downton Abbey” does, there’s nothing 
wrong with donning 1920s period attire and playing 
pretend just for a little while.

As soon as I had turned the last page of Deborah 
Levy’s “The Man Who Saw Everything,” I set the 
book down and opened up my laptop: I had a lot 
of research ahead of me. It wasn’t to fill any gaps 
in my knowledge of the book’s historical, behind-
the-iron-curtain context, or to learn more about 
the Beatles’ photo shoot on Abbey Road, around 
which the book awkwardly pivots; it was in hopes 
of making any sense at all of the 200 pages I 
had just read. I needed to find out if there was a 
coherent storyline I somehow completely missed, 
if there were any real characters aside from the 
protagonist, what the themes were (if any) and so 
on.
Before I got much further, though, I had to 
pause and ask myself: Is this something I should 
have to do? Is the book that requires wholesale 
outsourcing of reading comprehension even worth 
trying to understand? I realized that if I was still 
in the dark after reading the thing cover to cover, 
perhaps I was always meant to be.
“The Man Who Saw Everything” is a 
chronically frustrating read. It is the experience 
of walking up to a storyteller whose confidence 
has drawn a crowd, but who is several paces into 
their story by the time you get there and unwilling 
to restart for you, so the best you can do is stick 
along for the ride — were this uncomfortable 
experience rendered in print and drawn out to 
span hundreds of pages. Here is the information 
you would encounter as you approach: The year is 
1988, and Saul Adler is a historian who specializes 
in the psychology of male tyrants. He has been 
granted the privilege of travel to East Berlin for 
his research, and for his host family’s daughter 
Luna, he and his photographer girlfriend Jennifer 
Moreau have planned an elaborate thank you: 
A recreation of the album art from Abbey Road 

for the Beatles fanatic Luna Müller is, lone Saul 
taking place of John, Paul, Goerge and Ringo. But 
Saul gets clipped by a car when he’s traversing the 
famous crosswalk, and it all quite lite spins out of 
control from that (early) point onward.
Granted, Levy did try to make the book that 
ensues about something. That “something” ranges 
from the art of photography to surveillance, to 
history, to memory, to masculinity, to sexuality, 
to family, to marriage, to parenthood — and while 
it is as tiring to compose that list as it likely is to 
read it, sadly, the book reads the same way. Worse 
yet, by encountering these subjects through the 
eyes of Levy’s unreliable, underdeveloped and 
almost unstoried narrator Saul Adler, the gulfs 
between these subjects are widened rather than 
creatively bridged. All the energy of the novel, 
which might have been directed toward Saul’s 
compellingly fraught relationships with his father 
and brother, or with the East German love of his 

life Walter Müller, is absorbed by Levy’s quest to 
figure out what the book’s about, sparing nothing 
for narrative momentum or climax.
I think this energy drain helps explain why, so 
often, Levy’s writing registers as lazy, as unmet 
potential. One of the strategies with which she 
tries to cohere her disparate themes is to repeat 
buzz words and sequences of dialogue. Rather 
than adding anything to the narrative, however, 
these have the effect of infantilizing the reader, 
like those not-so-subtle hints from your teacher 
that a pop quiz is in store, and that the topic will be 

the word they keep dramatically emphasizing. For 
instance, early on, Jennifer makes an observation 
about her photography that lingers on Saul’s mind: 
That a “spectre is inside every photograph she 
developed.” Rather than exploring that concept 
in subsequent pages, Moreau undermines her own 
attempt at exploring a thematic question, opting 
instead to apply the word “spectre” exasperatingly 
to everything else Saul contemplates, from his 
father’s death to the distinct scent of Jennifer’s 
perfume. It is as though Levy fears her readers’ 
inattention to the point where as long as we 
remember one word, she’d be content. 
I don’t universally condemn the novelist who 
creates and leaves gaps for their audience to fill. 
Often, those gaps enact a fruitful contract between 

writer and reader, promising that meaning can be 
co-created rather than in one party or the other’s 
death grip. But the novelist who doesn’t trust their 
readers enough to tell them anything beyond a 
meandering list of themes they want to touch on 
isn’t writing a novel at all; they’re publishing their 
idea journal and tricking their audience into doing 
all the work of finishing their thoughts. Deborah 
Levy is one such novelist, but she got away with 
it (and was rewarded for it: See this year’s Booker 
longlist).
What is the bare minimum you expect from 
your storytellers? Simply one coherent storyline? 
Or are you more picky, demanding character 
development or even thematic development of 
some sort? Would you ask for trust? I don’t think 
there’s anything wrong with claiming these 
values, or with requiring more from writers who 
don’t meet those standards. Ms. Levy, I expect 
more.

Did Deborah Levy just
publish her idea journal

AMERICAN BALLET THEATRE

The novelist who doesn’t trust their readers enough 
to tell them anything beyond a meandering list of 
themes they want to touch on isn’t writing a novel at 
all; they’re publishing their idea journal and tricking 
their audience into doing all the work of finishing 
their thoughts.

A few weeks ago I slid into a sticky leather 
booth in Espresso Royale. It was almost 8 p.m., 
and my energy levels for the day were nearing 
critical condition, but I’d rallied for this one last 
meeting. Amidst a sea of subsequent smalltalk, 
I met someone who said he liked to dance. Salsa 
dance, specifically, but I went ahead and shared 
that I was a ballet dancer in hopes of forming a 
connection. 
I wanted to keep going and tell him that I’ve 
actually always wanted to learn salsa, but he cut 
me off. He raised his nose and told me that ballet 
was boring and stiff. That it was only for old 
people, that his chosen form of movement was 
far superior. 
Stunned, I laughed. I explained that I didn’t 
think I was old, but I definitely enjoyed ballet. 
Plus, I stretch enough not to be stiff. He shook 
his head. Salsa is romantic, he said. And then, 
through the ebb and flow of conversation, our 
group found a different subject. 
I don’t recount this story out of existential 
bitterness. The same way the Super Bowl will 
always garner critics, ballet will never resonate 
with everyone. However, my new acquaintance’s 
final comment — that salsa is romantic with the 
implication that ballet is not — stuck with me. 
When I came home that night and opened my 
computer, an unfinished video of the balcony pas 
de deux (a ballet couple’s dance) from Kenneth 
MacMillan’s “Romeo and Juliet” started to load 
in an open YouTube tab. The intimate music of 
Sergei Prokofiev’s score filled my living room, 
and I thought again about that comment. 
After all, what does it mean to make a 
movement romantic? 
Through a Google Search I found a different 
video, this one of a couple dancing salsa on the 
streets of Miami. Through the shaky hand of 
an iPhone camera, a man and a woman shared 
three minutes of casual happiness set to the 
background of a city completely oblivious to the 
dance’s occurrence. Cars passed and pedestrians 

wandered as the dancers’s fleet footwork 
dissolved into the street’s ongoing bustle. The 
haphazardness of it all created an intimacy that 
gave way to an idyllic romance. I could see what 
my acquaintance was talking about. 
I’d expect myself to struggle when comparing 
this to “Romeo and Juliet.” After all, the pas de 
deux clip I watched came from the Royal Ballet, 
one of the most elite companies in the world. 
Their theater, the Royal Opera House, literally 
has a box reserved for the Queen herself. With 
the exception of her, the live audience pays 
hundreds of dollars for their tickets and iPhone 
cameras are strictly prohibited. No aspect goes 
unplanned or unperfected, and yet when I watch 
the dance unfold my heart fills with the same 
sense of intimate spontaneity as the salsa street 
dancing from before. 
Romeo and Juliet are only 14, both suffering 
from an all-too-familiar sense of juvenile 
confusion. Neither of them know what they want 
and both of them live life with an underlying 
nervousness for upcoming adulthood. When 
they find each other, their young hearts shift to 
focus solely on one another. Through their love, 
they find a drive far more mature than their 
years. The pas de deux on Juliet’s balcony is a 
manifestation of that new focus. 
Within the performance, I feel those moments 
of desire alongside the young couple: Juliet’s 
beaming chest, Romeo’s outstretched hands, 
their luxurious makeout session and weightless, 
slow motion lifts and turns. 
It’s a spectacle of teenage melodrama and 
through its display the planning melts away. 
Suddenly, I see a casual meetup on the streets 
of Italy. It’s two people — two kids — intensely 
focused on enjoying each other while an entire 
city continues to pass by. 
I can’t help but wonder what my acquaintance 
would think if he peeled back the technique to 
see this side of ballet. Whether onstage at the 
Royal Opera House or on an unnamed sidewalk 
in Florida, I still find that intangible sense of 
effortlessness dictated through non-vocalized 
movement. They might both be romantic, but 
above all they’re both human.

Tuesday, September 24, 2019 — 7

Just four days after falling 
short in a five-set thriller against 
Notre 
Dame, 
the 
Michigan 
volleyball team had something 
to prove against the Fighting 
Irish on Sunday afternoon.
Powered 
by 
sophomore 
outside hitter Paige Jones’ third 
consecutive double-double, the 
Wolverines (7-3) finished their 
non-conference slate on a high 
note, exacting revenge on Notre 
Dame, 25-23, 25-15, 20-25, 25-16, 
in the second half of the home-
and-home series.
Michigan raced out to an 
early lead, winning seven of 
the match’s first nine points. 
Freshman 
opposite 
May 
Pertofsky exposed holes within 
the Fighting Irish’s (7-3) serve 
receive with a pair of aces, 
forcing Notre Dame into an 
early timeout. The middle stages 
of the set were relatively even, 
with the teams splitting the 
next 26 points coming out of the 
timeout.
Neither side was able to string 
together more than two in a row 
until the Fighting Irish scored 
four unanswered points to tie 
the frame at 23.
With the opening set on the 
line, senior setter MacKenzi 
Welsh took control of a broken 
play. Notre Dame’s outside hitter 
tried to roll a ball over her block, 
but Welsh sent the ball to the 
back corner on the first contact. 
It landed just out of the reach 
of a diving libero, giving the 
Wolverines the only set point 
they needed.
Michigan has been relatively 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
first 
contact throughout the early 
stages of the season, so Welsh 
has 
grown 
accustomed 
to 
getting creative. When poor 
passing puts the Wolverines 
out of system, their senior floor 
captain kept them in the rally.
“It’s a lot of running around 
sometimes,” 
Welsh 
said. 
“Consistently, 
if 
people 
are 
working hard defensively then 
it’s me working twice as hard to 

make sure that we’re putting the 
next ball up and making the play 
better. Just trying to get hitters 
in the best position possible 
while also fighting for the people 
who hit the first touch.
“That’s the most important 
thing in our gym — defense and 
fighting all the way through the 
rally.”
Michigan’s 
emphasis 
on 
defense carried over into the 
second set, particularly in the 
front 
row. 
The 
Wolverines 
posted nine team blocks for 
the match, with five different 
players recording multiple block 
assists.
Fifth-year 
senior 
middle 
blocker Cori Crocker tallied 
a season-high six blocks and 
chipped in four kills. Even when 
she wasn’t sending balls back, 
her touches at the net slowed 
most swings down before they 
reached the back row.
“Sometimes (Crocker) tries 
to be too big,” Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen said. “ … She plays 
big and sometimes she needs 
to play a little more controlled 
and not always so big. I thought 
tonight she did that really well.
“Their 
offense 
is 
very 
patterned in what they do. I 
thought our blockers did a good 
job of picking up their pattern 
and then being very efficient 
against it.”
When 
it 
came 
time 
to 
finish the sweep, however, the 
Fighting Irish fought back. They 
came out of the locker room 
with a refined approach that 
emphasized tactical serves at 
different distances in an effort 
to move the Wolverines’ passers 
off their line. It kept the unit off-
guard, thus making the back row 
less aggressive in anticipation.
Michigan’s 
serve 
receive 
failed to adjust and its offense 
suffered as a result. Without a 
consistent foundation to work 
from, Welsh spent most of the 
set scrambling. The Wolverines’ 
third-set 
hitting 
percentage 
was capped at just .100, their 
lowest mark of the match by 
over 
175 
percentage 
points. 
They committed eight errors, a 

stark contrast to the nine total 
mistakes they made in the three 
other sets combined.
But in the fourth frame, 
Michigan returned the favor 
when it mattered most. The 
Wolverines used a six-point 
run midway through the set 
to put the match out of reach, 
holding Notre Dame to a hitting 
percentage of -.088 — just its 
second negative efficiency rating 
in a set this season.
Fittingly, 
Crocker’s 
sixth 
block set up Michigan’s first 
match point. The Fighting Irish 
were held to a hitting percentage 
of just .117 for the match — a 
74-point 
improvement 
from 
the mid-week matchup for the 
Wolverines. Rosen spoke highly 
of his team’s defense during 
Wednesday’s loss in South Bend, 
but noticed one key difference in 
his team’s blocking in Sunday’s 
rematch.
“Tonight, we got (blocks) on 
the stat sheet,” Rosen said. “We 
blocked them to the point where 
they really weren’t coverable as 
much.”

In the first set of Sunday’s 
match against Notre Dame, May 
Pertofsky stepped up to the line to 
serve and quickly earned Michigan 
a point to go up 5-2 on a service ace.
On the next play, the freshman 
opposite hitter would once again 
secure a service ace, forcing the 
Fighting Irish (7-3) to call a timeout 
and giving the Michigan volleyball 
team (7-3) early momentum in a 
game that it was in a breezy 3-1 
victory.
Pertofsky, who has become 
a 
major 
contributor 
for 
the 
Wolverines in the early stages of 
their season, has arguably been 
the team’s best server, notching 13 
service aces thus far this season. 
She tied her career high on Sunday 
with four total service aces, adding 
two more in the match’s second 
set. Despite her prowess on the 
service line, Michigan coach Mark 
Rosen believes that she still hasn’t 
hit her full potential in that facet of 
the game.
“Her serve is definitely a really 

fun work in progress,” Rosen said. 
“It’s getting better and better, and 
when it’s on, it’s nasty.”
Added Pertofsky: “I’ve been in 
practice working on getting my 
serve more consistent, harder, and 
I’m still working on it.”
Despite her prowess on serves, 
Pertofsky 
was 
perhaps 
most 
effective in the front row, blocking 
five shots and notching five assists. 
Her ability to disrupt shots allowed 
the Wolverines to extend rallies 
against the Fighting Irish all match 
long, many of which they won 
thanks to Pertofsky’s set ups.
“I thought she was great 
tonight,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“She’s 
learning how to be a very 
consistent player, and for the most 
part this year she’s been that.”
In the second set, Pertofsky 
came up to serve with the game 
tied early at three. She ripped one 
into the left corner, scoring her 
third ace. After a Notre Dame 
error, Pertofsky once again scored 
a service ace, giving Michigan a 6-3 
edge and momentum that it would 
carry to a 25-15 victory — the most 
lopsided win of the match.

“I just went back there and said, 
‘We really need this momentum 
right now and just come out as 
hard as we can,’ ” Pertofsky said. “I 
was like ‘I’m just gonna go after it,’ 
so I served as hard as I could and 
I felt the connection was really 
good.”
In the fourth set, Pertofsky 
once again came up big for the 
Wolverines. With a seven-point 
lead, she netted a kill on a spike off 
a pass from senior setter MacKenzi 
Welsh. On the next play, she 
blocked a ball right in front of the 
net and gave Michigan a 24-15 lead 
on its way to a 25-16 victory to close 
the match.
After 
finishing 
the 
match 
with 17.5 points to lead the team, 
Pertofsky should continue to be 
a force for the Wolverines as they 
head into their conference slate. 
Even though he knows there’s still 
room to improve, Rosen couldn’t 
be happier with his freshman’s 
stellar outing.
“Tonight was a great match 
for her,” Rosen said. “And it was a 
great match against a really great 
opponent.”

‘M’ takes fourth place

The Michigan women’s cross 
country team came to the John 
McNichols Invitational with 
a chance to prove it belonged 
amongst the nation’s elite. Led 
by freshman sensation Erika 
VanderLende — the number 
one freshman in the country 
according to FloTrack — the 
Wolverines showed they are 
close to it by placing fourth 
against a 21-team field that 
included three other top-10 
teams. 
This wasn’t just any early-
season 
race, 
however. 
The 
course at Indiana State is 
the site of the 2019 NCAA 
Championships for the 19th 
consecutive 
season, 
though 
this race was just 5,000 meters, 
1,000 
meters 
shorter than the 
championship 
race.
Michigan was 
also without a 
few key runners. 
Last year’s Big 
Ten 
Freshman 
of 
the 
Year, 
Ann 
Forsyth, 
ran unattached 
along 
with 
freshman Amber Gall. As for 
sophomore Jessi Larson, who 
was a member of last year’s top-
four finishing squad at NCAA’s, 
status is more complicated.
 “It’s 50/50 if we have her for 
the championship part of the 
season, ” said Michigan coach 
Mike McGuire.
VanderLende had a standout 
performance for the Wolverines 
on Saturday, coming in fourth 
overall, behind only an NCAA 
champion Werner and two 
other seniors. As a Michigan 
high school record holder in the 
two mile and No. 1 nationally for 
that event in 2019 at Rockford, 
it shouldn’t come as much of 
a surprise that VanderLende 
is already competing at such a 

high level. The race saw her go 
with the lead group from the 
gun and never fall off to the 
chase pack. Her time of 16:40.1 
is also the fastest time by a 
Michigan runner at this course, 
eclipsing the previous mark set 
by Katie McGregor back in 1998 
by over 20 seconds.
“She did a nice job moving up 
through the third and fourth 
kilometer,” 
McGuire 
said. 
“Really happy with how she 
ran. ”
VanderLende wasn’t the only 
Michigan runner to finish near 
the top, though. Seven other 
Michigan runners finished in 
the top 35, two greater than any 
other team at the meet. As the 
Wolverines’ biggest strength 
coming into this season was 
their depth, Saturday proved 
just 
that. 
Juniors 
Kathryn 
House 
and 
Maddy Trevisan 
came in second 
and 
third 
for 
the 
team, 
respectively, 
and behind them 
was a group of 
five 
Michigan 
runners within 
nine places of 
each other. 
“We 
did 
a 
nice job packing, ” McGuire 
said. “We’d like to and we feel 
we can move that pack up closer 
to our third runner.”
Though the Wolverines felt 
good about their performances, 
they 
didn’t 
pull 
anything 
unexpected and beat any teams 
they weren’t supposed to. They 
came in fourth behind the other 
three nationally-ranked schools 
present at the meet, and if they 
want to be one of the teams to 
beat, they’re going to need to 
beat those types of teams.
“We were solid, but at the 
same time we are capable of 
getting better, ” McGuire said. 
“If we sure some things up, we 
can be a contending team going 
forward.”

SPENCER RAINES
For The Daily

WOMEN’S CROSS COUNTRY

We can be a 
contending 
team going 
forward.

Michigan flexes forward depth through four lines

Running 
a 
finger 
down 
the Michigan hockey team’s 
lineups, next to the majority 
of the players’ names will be 
the letter “F” — indicating 
their position, forward. Of the 
27 players on the roster, 17 are 
forwards. Among the forwards, 
there’s a mix of returnees, 
rookies, 
even 
a 
graduate 
transfer.
Questions will arise about 
chemistry, 
experience 
or 
defensive capabilities. But the 
ability to score answers itself.
“Can he score?
Yes. 
Can he?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.”
Looking up and down the 
lineups, Mel Pearson expresses 
the utmost confidence.
“We 
have 
four 
lines,” 
Pearson said. “Four lines, that 
can play against anybody. Four 
lines who can score, and I really 
like that. I think that’s going to 
be the strength of our team, are 
our forwards.”
From the previous year, the 
only forwards to depart from 
the program were Josh Norris, 
who left to join the Ottawa 
Senators, and Brendan Warren, 
who left due to graduation. 
However, their contributions 
were 
limited. 
Norris 
was 
injured halfway through the 
season 
in 
World 
Juniors, 
cutting his season short with 19 
points in 17 games. Warren only 
tallied three points over the 
course of the year.
“You take out Josh, and when 
you look at it, he only played 
half a year for us,” Pearson said. 
“And then, Brendan Warren, 
and that’s really it. We’ve added 
some real good depth there. 
And it’s going to be hard to fill 
out our lineup every night up 
front.”
The team moved on from 
both players quickly, replacing 
Norris with then-junior Nick 
Pastujov on the top line for 

half a year. Replacement for 
Warren’s production will be 
easy to come by. 
“You can take one guy and 
plugging other one, another 
player in and I don’t think 
you’re going to see a big drop 
off or any real change,” Pearson 
said.
On the flip side, 13 players 
return — responsible for 180 
points from the previous season. 
In addition, Michigan added 
freshmen 
draftees 
Johnny 
Beecher and Eric Ciccolini 
as well as graduate transfer 
Jacob Hayhurst. 
The 
problem 
went from who 
would 
replace 
the 
missing 
production 
to 
who all will step 
out on ice.
It’s 
the 
plethora 
of 
choices 
that 
Pearson thinks 
is 
beneficial 
for the team. Having too many 
talented forwards can only 
muster 
higher 
competition 
in practice. There are only 12 
slots, not including the extra 

skater. So, a maximum of 13 
forwards can be dressed for any 
one game, meaning there will 
be forwards forced to sit that 
can make an impact.
“But that’s what you want,” 
Pearson said. “You want these 
tough decisions.
“It’s going to be some really 
good players not playing, not 
dressing, let alone not playing 
and just not dressing.”
Senior 
defenseman 
Luke 
Martin 
shares 
the 
same 
sentiment 
as 
Pearson. 
The 
competition for the forward 
spots, 
he 
thinks, 
brings 
excitement 
in 
the 
rink 
each 
and 
every 
practice. All the 
players, having 
to defend against 
them in practice, 
are capable of 
winning a spot 
in his eyes. 
“Right down 
the line,” Martin said. “It’s 
going to be tight. And it’s just 
going to make, like I said, it’s 
gonna make practice that much 
better.” 

The strength of having four 
lines is invaluable. Whereas 
some teams will focus on 
having two strong “top lines” 
and stack the remaining lines 
with 
situational 
players, 
Pearson believes the course of 
action that best benefits the 
Wolverines is to have all four 
lines be capable of scoring, 
and that Michigan has the 
personnel to make that happen. 
No checking lines. No energy 
line. Just four lines that can 
play and score.
And four strong lines allows 
for wear-and-tear action. As 
Pearson points out, especially 
in professional hockey, the top 
six forwards will form two 
lines that strike after the third 
and fourth lines put pressure on 
the other team. The Wolverines 
believe they have four lines 
capable of keeping the pressure 
on for 60 minutes, which will 
result in higher-scoring games.
“I think we have four lines 
that not a lot of teams are going 
to be able to keep up with in a 
match, game in and game out,” 
Pastujov said. “ ... Just watch us, 
hopefully, roll over teams with 
four lines.”

Four parting thoughts from Michigan’s disastrous loss at Wisconsin

Michigan went into Saturday’s 
game against Wisconsin aiming 
to 
make 
a 
statement. 
Well, 
mission accomplished.
Instead of a statement of 
affirmation — that this program 
could win a game in a tough 
environment, against a team 
of equal or better talent — the 
Wolverines 
confirmed 
the 
opposite.
Now forced to pick up the 
pieces from a 35-14 drubbing 
in Madison, Michigan has to 
re-evaluate and re-calibrate. In 
doing so, it left plenty to digest 
about a season suddenly teetering 
on the brink. Here are four 
parting thoughts on a season-
altering weekend and the peril it 
puts this season in.
So 
much 
for 
offensive 
balance
After the game Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh was asked what 
he wanted this team’s offensive 
identity to be. He didn’t dare 
utter the phrase that is quickly 
descending into meme territory. 
You know the one. “Quickness 
in open areas,” or something of 
that ilk. Hard to remember at 
this point. His answer, though 
nondescript, spoke to one of this 
team’s many flaws.
“To be able to run the ball, to be 
able to throw the ball,” Harbaugh 
said. “Both equally effective and 
efficient.”
Through 
three 
weeks, 
Harbaugh’s offense — ahem, sorry, 
Josh Gattis’ offense — has been 
neither balanced nor efficient. 
Saturday against Wisconsin, that 
play-calling tilted heavily toward 
the passing attack by a margin of 
42-19. Last week against Army, 
the Wolverines ran the ball 45 
times and threw it 31 times. 
Through 
three 
weeks, 
Michigan is averaging 3.49 yards 
per carry. From a group that was 
supposed to be anchored by an 
experienced, 
sturdy 
offensive 
line and a promising young 
running back, balance should 

be an attainable necessity. And 
yet, both Harbaugh and the 
players lamented the disparity on 
Saturday.
“(The running game is) one 
thing we ran away from and I 
wish we would’ve stayed with 
it,” said senior tight end Nick 
Eubanks after the game.
Making strict judgments off the 
run/pass ratios can be misleading; 
play-calling is often dictated 
by game context, and Michigan 
has allowed a touchdown on the 
opening drive of all three games 
this season. That can throw any 
plan for a loop.
But 
for 
an 
offense 
that 
continues to strive for balance, 
among other things, it’s doing 
little to actually dictate game 
context instead of lay victim to it. 
A 
different 
kind 
of 
quarterback quandry
As 
Saturday’s 
first 
half 
progressed, the murmurs became 

rumblings, rumblings became 
primal screams.
The calls for junior quarterback 
Dylan McCaffrey stemmed more 
for a desperate clamor for change 
of any kind. 
Senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson continued to display 
carelessness in terms of ball 
security. He missed open reads 
and open receivers. In the third 
quarter, whether via injury or 
ineptitude, he was replaced by 
McCaffrey — only to come back 
in when McCaffrey exited with a 
concussion. Asked to assess their 
play, Harbaugh declined to go 
into specifics.
“Shea was being evaluated at 
halftime, and then we put Dylan 
in to start the second half,” he 
said after the game. “Dylan, he’s 
got a concussion.”
It’s easy to funnel any offensive 
frustrations to one place, and by 
default, the quarterback is often 

the victim of that. Patterson has 
played poorly through three 
weeks, and the quarterback play 
is problematic. Solving those 
issues cannot, and will not, turn 
a floundering offense into a 
thriving one on its own. Those 
two things can be, and are, true. 
In the short term, there’s little 
discussion to be had. McCaffrey 
is potentially recovering from 
his concussion; Patterson will be 
under center next week against 
Rutgers.
In the long term, if these 
issues persist from Patterson, 
it will become harder to ignore 
the validity of those frantic pleas 
from fans.
Keep it simple, stupid
Let’s start with the facts. 
Donovan Peoples-Jones, Tarik 
Black and Nico Collins have 
33 combined targets through 
three weeks. That trio, the most 
talented Michigan has had in 

quite some time, has 19 combined 
catches for 313 yards in that span. 
Saturday, they had one combined 
catch through three quarters, 
until all three made plays in 
garbage time to reiterate the 
following point:
Michigan’s 
misuse 
of 
its 
three best playmakers has been 
inexplicable 
and 
inexcusable. 
It’s an abject failure of coaching. 
Period. 
They have the potential to 
spearhead the best receiving 
corps in the Big Ten. Instead, they 
haven’t been given a chance. 
Eubanks was asked after the 
game about their involvement (or 
lack thereof) in the offense this 
season. He expressed faith in the 
staff to figure it out.
“We all see it on film. And I 
believe the coaches will see it as 
well,” Eubanks said. “And we’ll 
go from there in terms of who 
needs to get the ball and moving 

through the offense.” 
As 
this 
offense 
searches 
frantically for its identity, it would 
seem prudent to start with its best 
players. As the saying goes, “keep 
it simple, stupid.”
Michigan’s defense has an 
identity crisis of its own
It was hard to tell where this 
defense stood after two weeks. 
It had allowed 21 points against 
a 
meager 
Middle 
Tennessee 
State, but the offense set it up 
for failure. Same for the showing 
against Army, in which it held 
the Black Knights to their lowest 
rushing yardage total since 2015. 
The 
institutional 
framework, 
it seemed, had carried over. 
The defense was not the source 
for concern. While the offense 
overcame the speedbumps of its 
transition, the defense could help 
tread water.
“We finally can play Michigan 
defense, where we can go back 
and run our stuff that we run 
all preseason and all spring 
practice,” Brown said last week. 
“Quite frankly, I’ve been writing 
Wisconsin cards (and) I’m kind 
of: ‘Whew, whew.’ I can whip 
‘em out like that, because it’s 
all the stuff our guys know and 
are comfortable with, and we’ll 
jump in it at a high level without 
question.”
So much for that.
The 
Badgers 
rampaged 
their way to 354 rushing yards. 
Wisconsin 
quarterback 
Jack 
Coan completed 13 of 16 passes, 
and 
with 
comparative 
ease. 
And it wasn’t just that they 
ran 
through 
the 
Michigan 
defense, but how. There were no 
schematic mysteries, no notable 
gameplan mishaps. This was one 
team telling its opponent what 
it planned to do, then shoving it 
right at them anyway. 
For the Wolverines, these are 
problems that aren’t going away. 
The personnel isn’t changing. 
The coaching staff isn’t changing. 
Three weeks in, all Michigan’s 
cards are on the table. 
And it certainly appears Brown 
was bluffing.

The Michigan football team has a bevy of problems to deal with and questions to answer after Saturday’s 35-14 loss to the Badgers in Madison.

Harbaugh shoulders blame, looks 
to correct physicality and hustle

You saw it, and so did Jim 
Harbaugh.
There’s no extra level of 
analysis needed, no added layers 
of expertise necessary. Michigan 
got rocked on Saturday. 
Now it has to deal with the 
fallout.
“Watching the film it was 
pretty obvious to everybody that 
was watching in the entire football 
world, from A to Z, it wasn’t good,” 
Harbaugh said. “It wasn’t good 
enough. Not acceptable.”
It wasn’t one area that proved 
decisive in Wisconsin’s 35-14 
win. It was all of them. Coaching. 
Physicality. Effort. 
On Monday, Harbaugh stood at 
the podium with the demeanor of 
a man ready for introspection.
The scene bore all the makings 
of a normal press conference: 
Harbaugh standing there in a 
sweatshirt and khakis with his 
hands folded, speaking with as 
much of a filter as he can muster 
and giving short responses to 
injury questions. Rarely, though, 
has the Michigan coach been 
as direct as he was Monday 
afternoon.
He took responsibility, and 
so did the players. He said, 
repeatedly, that the performance 
wasn’t acceptable, and that it 
starts with him. He said the 
effort wasn’t there on Saturday, 
giving the requisite cliches about 
believing in his team, with the 
caveat that, in all areas, things 
must improve — no excuses and 
no way around it.
“We 
didn’t 
play 
physical 
enough,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“We were out-hustled. I take 
responsibility for that. In any 
ways that we were out-schemed, 
I take responsibility for that. 
It’s my job to make sure we are 
completely sound, in all offenses 
and defenses that we’re running.”
There are no shortage of areas 
to improve, but Harbaugh turned 
the focus to the trenches, on 
both sides of the ball. Wisconsin 
outran Michigan by a margin 

of over 300 yards on Saturday. 
The Badgers overwhelmed the 
Wolverines with size in the run 
game, breaking open holes for 
Jonathan Taylor. The subsequent 
scoring forced Michigan to throw 
the ball on offense. After the 
game and on Monday, offensive 
players talked about how jarring 
it was to have passed 42 times, 
“which is something I haven’t 
seen at Michigan since I’ve been 
here,” fifth-year senior tackle Jon 
Runyan Jr. said.
Strictly 
speaking, 
he’s 
incorrect. 
In 
2015, 
Runyan’s 
freshman year, Michigan hit 
that mark three times and it did 
so in the 2018 Outback Bowl as 
well. But his answer speaks to 
something greater.
Despite Josh Gattis’ promises 
of a vertical passing game, this 
group still wants its identity to 
be rooted on the ground. On 
Saturday, it lost that.
“They took us out of our game 
that we wanted to play,” Runyan 
said. “That’s something we’re 
really not used to, with throwing 
that many times in a game.”
It doesn’t help that senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson 
seemed to be playing through an 
injury Saturday — Harbaugh said 
Saturday that he was evaluated 
at halftime — and was constantly 
dodging pressure, as Wisconsin 
racked up two sacks and seven 
hurries.
Patterson proved his mettle 
last year, when he threw for 2,600 
yards and had as good a season 

as any Michigan quarterback has 
in the last decade. But against 
Wisconsin, he alternated between 
running for his life and looking 
lost.
“We have to do a better job 
of protecting the quarterback,” 
Harbaugh said. “Have to give him 
time to make throws, make reads. 
Do what he’s capable of doing, he’s 
a very good player.”
On Saturday, tight end Nick 
Eubanks said that the offense 
dwelled on their early errors, in 
particular Ben Mason’s fumble 
near the goal-line. Harbaugh 
didn’t reject the premise outright 
on Monday, but he refused to take 
it as an excuse.
If that bled into effort, it’s 
correctable, but also as indicting 
as anything Michigan did on 
Saturday.
“Effort’s something that can’t 
be coached it’s kind of a personal 
business decision you make,” 
Runyan said. “... Looking back 
on the film, not trying to call 
out anyone, but I feel like there 
were some plays where the effort 
could’ve been better. 
“I think along with effort 
comes execution. Guys aren’t 
going to trot on the field being like, 
‘I’m probably only going to give 
60% of effort this play.’ No one’s 
thinking that. They were able to 
exploit those matchups and get to 
where they wanted to get.”
Acknowledging those errors 
is the first step. Now it’s on 
Harbaugh 
and 
Michigan 
to 
correct them.

Wolverines hoping to rebound

Jordan Glasgow remembers 
his first tough loss at Michigan 
— the infamous “trouble with 
the snap” play that doomed the 
Wolverines against Michigan 
State his freshman year. But 
they didn’t let it stick with 
them, winning their next four 
games — including three on the 
road — before losing to Ohio 
State to finish 9-3. Michigan 
capped it all off with a win in 
the Citrus Bowl.
Last year, the Wolverines did 
something similar, dropping 
their opener at Notre Dame 
before ripping off a 10-game 
winning streak to finish 10-2 
with a loss to the Buckeyes and 
a berth in the Peach Bowl.
Neither 
of 
those 
things 
guarantee that Michigan will 
do the same this year. After 
all, 
the 
Wolverines 
looked 
much worse against Wisconsin 
on Saturday than they did in 
their 
previous 
early-season 
losses. But Michigan players 
still remember that they’ve 
rebounded before, and going 
forward, the only thing left 
to do is believe they can do it 
again.
“There have been a lot of 
tough losses since I’ve been 
here and I don’t think we’ve let 
any of those losses really define 
us,” 
said 
fifth-year 
senior 
linebacker Jordan Glasgow. “ 
… I feel like we can go on to be 
a successful team and we can 
improve going forward.”
The 
Wolverines 
pointed 
out again and again Monday 
that all their goals are still 
ahead of them. Every Big Ten 
East 
winner 
since 
division 
realignment in 2014 has had 
at least one loss, and losing to 
a West team like Wisconsin 
means that it could still hold 
the 
head-to-head 
tiebreaker 
against other East foes. And 
Michigan will enter the easiest 
part of its schedule: home 
games with Rutgers and No. 14 
Iowa and a road trip to Illinois.
Those games could provide a 
good opportunity to get back on 
track, but could is the operative 

word. The Wolverines have 
shown little cohesion so far, 
and they’ve struggled to handle 
in-game adversity. There are 
multiple areas that need fixing, 
from run blocking to turnovers 
to defensive line play. But 
there’s now plenty of the bad 
stuff on film for Michigan to 
learn from. The trick now is to 
stay mentally strong enough to 
not get discouraged.
“I’m kinda looking at this 
loss as a learning moment,” 
said fifth-year senior offensive 
lineman Jon Runyan. “I’ve had 
some hard losses here, this 
one is early on in the season. 
It’s against a Big Ten West 
opponent. Everything we want 
is still ahead of us.
“We can’t lose another game. 
It’s tough losing a game in the 
Big Ten already, but we’ve got 
everything ahead of us. Can’t 
dwell on this too much or we’re 
not gonna be moving forward.”
Runyan 
noted 
how 
the 
Badgers were able to dictate 

what 
the 
Wolverines 
did 
offensively, forcing them to 
throw the ball way more than 
they were comfortable with. 
Against the Scarlet Knights, the 
first item on Runyan’s agenda 
is to force Rutgers’ defense to 
react to Michigan’s offense, 
rather than the other way 
around.
But after the Wolverines 
are done with their film study, 
there’s no reason to dwell on 
Wisconsin anymore. If there’s 
any hope of still reaching the 
goals they constantly speak of, 
they’ll have to keep that game 
in the past and just keep moving 
forward.
“It 
was 
a 
bad 
day 
for 
Michigan,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “And I 
don’t want that to turn into two 
losses, don’t let one loss turn 
into two. ... This week (is) the 
most important. Win the next 
game, come back to work and 
make sure it doesn’t happen 
again.”
