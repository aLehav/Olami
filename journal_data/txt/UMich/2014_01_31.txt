Harris-Perry opens
University's Black
History Month
celebrations
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily Staff Reporter
Though Black History Month
does not officially begin until Sat-
urday, the University began its
month-long series of events two
days early with a keynote address
by Dr. Melissa Harris-Perry, host
of MSNBC's "Melissa Harris-Per-
ry Show" and a political science
professor at Tulane University.
At the University's 2014 Black

History Month Keynote Lecture
Thursday evening, Harris-Perry
discussed ways to address racial
issues on campus to about 500
students, faculty, staff and alumni
who attended the lecture at Rack-
ham Auditorium.
The hour-long lecture delved
into a history of the collective
efforts of the Black community,
from the Civil Rights Movement
to the continued institutional
marginalization of Black bodies
and experiences today. Harris-
Perry said continuous struggle is
an avoidable trait of a democracy,
and stressed that one uncontested
voice is more fitting of a totalitar-
ian regime.
She said a problem with cam-
pus activism today is that allies

have not experienced the same
"corporeal body experiences" of
the Black community, and mis-
understandings often arise as a
result.
"A problem with race talk on
campus is how we know that we
know something," Harris-Perry
said. "I know that this moment
is racist because it trips my racial
trigger, because it makes me feel
nauseous. I'm notgenerallyangry,
butyoujustmade me mad."
She added that the problem
stems from an inability to scien-
tifically measure these emotions.
Concerning real change on
campus, Harris-Perry suggested
that student activists focus on
fostering change within the Uni-
versity faculty and administra-

tion. The administration can then
inform students and construct a
functional feedback loop between
students and administrators.
While allies may not be able
to directly relate to Black experi-
ences, she said, they can engage
with professors and then with the
wider community once they have
the proper tools to help.
She said students need to break
down the walls between their
separate campus lives and their
interactions with faculty mem-
bers, adding that bringing change
to campus "cannot be identity
politics."
"There has to be people
engaged with these questions,"
Harris-Perry said. "Part of the

Document from
Athletic Dept. offices
confirmed kicker's
permanent separation
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
and MATT SLOVIN
Daily StaffReporter and
DailySports Writer
An agreement signed by for-
mer kicker Brendan Gibbons
finalizing his permanent separa-
tion from the University of Mich-
igan is marked as transmitted via
fax from the Michigan football
program - raising questions as
to when football officials were
aware that Gibbons had been
found responsible for sexual mis-
conduct.
At the latest, the Athletic
Department was made aware
of the permanent separation on
Dec. 19, 2013, and it is unclear
whether the football program
or Michigan coach Brady Hoke
were aware of the Office of Insti-
tutional Equity's earlier finding
that Gibbons was responsible for
sexual misconduct. The Office of
Student Conflict Resolution noti-
fied Gibbons on Dec. 19 that he
would be permanently separated
from the University.

"December 19 is whenever the
letter was sent and the kid came
to talk with the Athletic Depart-
ment," said Athletic Department
spokesman Dave Ablauf in a
phone interview with the Daily
on Wednesday.
He later added: "That could
have been the time that Brendan
Gibbons talked to coach Hoke."
Gibbons' separation stems
from an incident on Nov. 22,
2009, according to documents.
This corresponds with previous
media reports that Ann Arbor
Police carried out an investiga-
tion of a Michigan football player
related to an incident on that
date.
The document was sent at 4:02
p.m. on Dec.19 from a fax number
associated with the football pro-
gram. Gibbons signed the docu-
ment, waiving his right to appeal
the sanction. It's not clear from
the markings on the document
who received the fax transmis-
sion.
The letter was faxed from
the offices of the football pro-
gram four days before Hoke
told reporters at a Dec. 23 press
conference that Gibbons would
not travel to the Buffalo Wild
Wings Bowl in Tempe, Ariz. due
to a "family matter." It's not clear
whether Hoke was involved in

After State of the
Union address, ballot
commitee unites to

By SHOHAM GEVA
DailyStaffReporter
Five community groups and orga-
nizations announced Monday the
formation of a new ballot committee,
Raise Michigan, which will explore
the feasibility of a November bal-
lot initiative to raise the minimum
wage in the state.
The committee has not yet offi-
cially declared its intent to launch
a campaign for the ballot initiative
since formal language regarding the
proposed policy has not been sub-
mitted. However, Frank Houston,
director of the Restaurant Opportu-
nities Center of Michigan, which is
a part of the coalition, said Tuesday
the committee will most likely do so
soon.
"Right nowit's technically just an
exploration phase," Houston said.
"But the reality is what we've seen
and why we've formed this commit-
tee is that when you look at what's

Government officials talk
state and nationa pay hike

Dingell, Zemke,
Irwin meet to
discuss prospects
for wage reform
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Last week, Zingerman's co-
owner Paul Saginaw visited
Washington, D.C. to lobby Sec-
retary of Labor Thomas Perez
for an increase in minimum
wage. But on Thursday, D.C.
came to Zingerman's.

Rep. JohnDingell (D-Mich.),
joined by state Rep. Jeff Irwin
(D-Ann Arbor) and state Rep.
Adam Zemke (D-Ann Arbor),
ate a late lunch with Zinger-
man's employees and localbusi-
ness owners to discuss actions
on the federal and state level to
raise the minimum wage.
Dingell, who is a co-sponsor
of the Fair Minimum Wage Act
of 2013, said a local business
coming to Washington to share
its views testifies to the impor-
tance of the issue.
"It says that there's convic-
tion there, which is sufficient to
cause a very substantial expen-

diture to inform the Congress
of what Zingerman's and what
Mr. Saginaw, who made the
trip, thinks is the need of the
country," Dingell said.
While Dingell praised Zing-
erman's for its food, he continu-
ally acknowledged the deli as a
leader in the fight for increased
wages by setting a good exam-
ple for other businesses: the
restaurant pays its employees
above minimum wage.
Roughly 10 Zingerman's
employees gathered around a
table to voice their support for
a wage increase and to ask what

CSG faces budget decrease
for student organizations

Polish Studies program
recognized after 40 years


Lower enrollment
means less funding
for SOFC and others
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
A drop in enrollment and a
stagnant student fee has ham-
strung Central Student Govern-
ment's funding, which will likely
award $36,000 less to student
groups this semester than it did

last semester.
Business senior Eric Kibler,
CSG's treasurer, said $120,000
of CSG's preliminary budget has
been set aside for the Student
Organization Funding Commis-
sion, compared to $156,000 last
semester.
The $120,000 is only 41 percent
of CSG's $293,451 total budget for
this semester, which is generated
from a $7.19 per-semester fee
from each student and any roll-
over funds.
In a viewpoint published by

BEST OF ANN ARBOR 2014

The Michigan Daily in March,
Business senior Mike Proppe,
CSG president, and Public Policy
senior Bobby Dishell, CSG's vice
president promised at least half of
CSG's budget would go to SOFC.
Kibler said the 50 per-
cent benchmark wasn't pos-
sible because CSG lost roughly
$30,000 in student fee revenue
this semester. According to pre-
liminary figures given to CSG,
members said about 4,000 fewer
students enrolled for class this
semester than in the fall - pend-
ing any increase or decrease fol-
lowingthe add/drop deadline.
Kibler said when the budget
was drafted, funding SOFC was a
priority, but CSG's compiled code
has specific rules against cutting
money from some areas of stu-
dent government.
"We couldn't really cut any-
where else in the budget," Kibler
said.
Still, as the semester progress-
es, unused money from some seg-
ments of CSG could be moved to
SOFC's budget.
Some CSG leaders hope raise
the $7.19 student fee for CSG -
which hasn't been raised since
2005 - to alleviate budgetary
shortfalls.
Even in the winter 2013 semes-
ter, when SOFC had $185,000 to
award, student organizations
requested more than $700,000,
Kibler said.
While Kibler said not all
requests of SOFC are necessary,
he and Proppe have discussed
raising the fee with administra-
tors.
"I would like to see CSG have
a higher income," Kibler said.
"Personally, I would like to dou-
ble the fee."
Raising the student fee has
been an annual discussion
among student government lead-
ers.
Business junior Skylar Pur-
sell, the current SOFC chair, said
in an e-mail interview even if the
revenue were increased, it's not
clear that SOFC would get sub-
stantially more funds.

After long being
considered a fund,
program now
officially established
By CARLY FROMM
Daily StaffReporter
It's about time.
Forty years after its incep-
tion, the Copernicus Program
in Polish Studies received Uni-
versity recognition earlier this
month.
Though the program has
funded fellowships, guest lec-
tures, summer grants and
courses pertaining to Polish
studies for years, it was previ-
ously considered a fund rather
than an official University pro-
gram.
Marysia Ostafin, executive
director of the program, said
formal recognition serves as
a testament to everything the
program has accomplished over
the past four decades.
"Until this formal recogni-
tion by the College of LSA, we
were just an informal endow-
ment that funded projects,"
Ostafin said. "It is a recogni-
tion of the work that we've
done over these years and also
a recognition of our fundrais-
ing. We've really established
ourselves."
The program, which receives
a large portion of its funds
from the Nicolaus Copernicus
Endowment, "is now widely
regarded as the premier Pol-
ish Studies program in North
America," according to a Uni-
versity press release.
"Everybody is delighted,"
Ostafin said. "We've achieved
something new and great."
She added that this recog-
nition will also aid in the pro-
gram's fundraising efforts.
"I think it'll help us in fun-
draising along the way, too,
because people will recognize
that this is a real, established
and recognized program in Pol-

ish studies," Ostafin said.
Alena Aniskiewicz, a gradu-
ate student in the Department
of Slavic Languages & Litera-
tures, said the program sets the
University apart from its com-
petitors.
"Thanks to the Copernicus
Endowment, Michigan is one
of the best places anywhere to
study Polish topics," Aniskie-
wicz said. "Its formal recogni-
tion as a program underscores
both its value to the Univer-
sity and a commitment to the
continued promotion of Polish
studies in Ann Arbor."
The Copernicus Program
has also been a draw for pro-
spective students.
Jodi Greig, a graduate stu-
dent in the Department of Slav-
ic Languages & Literatures,
decided to come to the Univer-
sity in large part due to the pro-
gram's offerings.
"One of the reasons I chose
my Ph.D. program at Michi-
gan is precisely the widespread
support for Polish studies,"
Greig said. "The Endowment
basically allowed me to com-
plete research every summer
for the first three years of grad-
uate school. It would have been
impossible to do summer Polish
language courses and research
without it."
Additionally, with the Coper-
nicus Endowment Fellowship,
students have had the opportu-
nity to study abroad.
Paulina Duda, another gradu-
ate student in the Department
of Slavic Languages & Lit-
eratures, said the Copernicus
Endowment provided her with
the opportunity to study in
Ukraine.
Duda left her home in Poland
to study at the University. Dur-
ing summer term, she said she
had planned to work in a coffee
shop before she discovered the
abroad opportunity.
"It's has been enriching the
student life immeasurably with
opportunities to travel to that
part of the world, to study the
language."

the Dec. 19 meeting described by
Ablauf.
Regardless of whether foot-
ball officials were aware of the
disciplinary investigations or
OSCR's subsequent sanctions,
legal experts told the Daily that
OSCR could have informed foot-
ball officials at any point during
the disciplinary investigation and
proceedings.
As previously reported by the
Daily, the outcomes. of disciplin-
ary proceedings in relation to vio-
lent or nonforcible sex offenses
are not protected by the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy
Act, a federal law that describes
handling and privacy protocols for
student records.
But the law also doesn't pre-
vent the University from sharing
details of any disciplinary record
internally if administrators deem
it necessary, according to Frank
LoMonte, executive director ofthe
Student Press Law Center.
"Even under FERPA, you can
share disciplinaryoutcomes inter-
nally if there's a business need
to know," LoMonte said. "That
would be a classic example of the
kind of disciplinary information
that could be shared regardless of
FERPA."
FERPA states that it does not
prohibit a school agency from
"disclosing such information
to teachers and school officials,
including teachers and school
officials in other schools, who
have legitimate educational
interests in the behavior of the
student."
It's not clear whether OSCR
directly informed athletic
officials about Gibbons' case.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald declined to comment.
LoMonte said athletic officials
are covered by this provision,
as they should be understood to
have an interest in the behavior
of students in their program.
Documents reviewed by the
Daily show that Gibbons was
found responsible for sexual
misconduct on or before Nov. 20.
OSCR officials could have noti-
fied the Athletic Department of
this finding prior to Michigan's
Nov. 23 game at Iowa, in which
Gibbons played.
"It is routine for universities
to share within themselves dis-
ciplinary information when it
relates to an activity of another
department that needs to be
aware of that outcome," said
Mark Goodman, a media law
professor at Kent State Univer-
sity. "I would argue that an ath-
letic department, when a claim
involves a student-athlete, is a
logical place for the outcome of a
proceeding to be communicated
to."
RACE
From Page 1A
answer to how you begin those
conversations is you bring more
faculty in who are teaching these
courses, who are well-resourced,
who are not visitors, who are not

adjuncts, but who are actual fac-
ulty."
University alum Amber Wil-
liams,the community development
program manager at the Trotter
Multicultural Center, organized
Thursday's event. She said she was
happy to have someone address
issues of race, especially in light of
the recent events on campus.
"Forsomanypeople,someofthe
experiences that she talks about
and issues that she talks about hit
close to home," Williams said.
Though Harris-Perry addressed
serious issues, audience members
applauded, snapped, cheered and
laughed throughoutthe lecture.
Engineering senior Breoshshala
Martin said she enjoyed Harris-
Perry's speech because of its
"down-to-earth" approach to dis-
cussing the lecture's themes.
"It was really good to come here
and hear her perspective on it,"
Martin said. "She wasn't talking
over your head, she was just really
personable with us."
The speech comes nearly a week
after the University's Black Stu-
dent Union met with University
administrators to discuss issues
surrounding minority inclu-
sion and diversity at the Univer-
sity raised by the group's #BBUM
Twittercampaign in December.As
a result, the University pledged to
allocate $300,000 to the Trotter
Center for renovations, which are
yet to be determined.

WAGE
From Page 1A
recently but historically, around
minimum wage, it takes some-
thinglike this to get an increase
done."
In its initial announcement,
Raise Michigan outlined three
main goals for its campaign:
raising the minimum wage from
its current rate of $7.40 per hour
to a figure between $9 and $10
per hour, raising the minimum
wage for restaurant servers and
tying the minimum wage to the
inflation index.
To place the question on the
ballot, the group would have to
gather either 258,088 voter sig-

Minimum wage has been a
popular topic state-wide and
nationally. Tuesday night, Pres-
ident Barack Obama announced
during his State of the Union
address that he will be signing
an executive order to raise the
minimum wage of new federal
contractors to $10.10.
Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Mark Schauer said
in November that if he's elect-
ed, he plans to raise the state's
minimum wage to $9.25. Thurs-
day, U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.) and state Reps. Adam
Zemke (D-Ann Arbor) and Jeff
Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) held a
lunch meeting at Zingerman's
Delicatessen with the shop's co-
owner, Paul Saginaw, to discuss
raising the minimum wage.
In their meeting, Zemke said
nearly 85 percent of democrats

and 50 percent of republicans
support raising minimum wage.
"I think it's kind of a no-
brainer," he said. "I think if they
put it on the ballot and they
managed to get that, I think it
would pass without a problem."
While students are not the
core demographic for all these
measures - most have an
emphasis on aiding full-time
minimum wage workers - for
those who do work, there could
be several possible outcomes as
a result of the new legislation.
LSA freshman Cassandra
Martinez, who works at the Vic-
tors caf6 in Mosher-Jordan Res-
idence Hall, said for her, even a
small increase in wage would be
significant because of the fewer
number of hours students are
typically able to work.
"Even a dollar would make a
big difference because we work
like a minimum of maybe three,
four hours a week," she said.
"Everything makes a difference
at this point."
Martinez currently makes
$9 per hour, but she added that
even with that wage--which
is the new minimum that the
Raise Michigan coalition is cur-
rently proposing--making ends
meet as a student is difficult.
"Trying to live off $9 an hour
and dealing with schoolwork
and extracurriculars - like for
me, I play a club sport - and
trying to do things that I want is
really hard," Martinez said.
University alum Emily Tay-
lor, the general manager at Mia
Za's Caf6, agreed that work-
ing enough to satisfy financial
needs as a student can be dif-
ficult.
"The whole purpose of my job
my senior year was to pay rent,
and I just barely made it, and

I was working between 18-20
hours a week," Taylor said. "And
my rent was low, it was a cheap
place, and it was still only just
barely coming in."
She added that at least at Mia
Za's, the move to increase mini-
mum wage could decrease how
many new positions are open to
students, prompting instead a
shift to more hours for existing
workers.
In terms of employment at
the University, which provides
a large number of the jobs stu-
dents have, the impact might be
less severe.
In an e-mail interview, Vickie
Crupper, associate director for
Client Services in the Office of
Financial Aid, wrote that when
it comes to student jobs at the
University, there have histori-
cally been more vacant posi-
tions than willing students.
"Because each department at
the University has control over
their own operating budget, it is
difficult for our office to know
if there will be any impact," she
wrote. "After the last minimum
wage increase, the University
still had more student tempo-
rary positions available than
there were students interested
in filling them."
Overall, Houston said when it
comes to state-by-state compar-
ison, Michigan isn't the worst in
terms of minimum wage, but it's
certainly not the best.
"A lot of the states that actu-
ally have lower unemployment
than Michigan, and have high-
er small business growth, and
have similar inflation rates all
have higher minimum wages
for tipped employees and regu-
lar employees," Houston said.
"I think it's long overdue that
Michigan joins the pack."

OFFICIALS
From Page 1A
their representatives were doing
to bring about the change.
Irwin and Zemke both cited
their co-sponsorship of state
House Bill 4386 as the concrete
action they are taking to increase
wages. If passed, the bill would
raise the minimum wage in the
state of Michigan from $7.40 to
$9 per hour. While the represen-
tatives were pessimistic about
the bill's chances, Zemke said he
was hopeful that it would pass in
the future ifa Democrat wins the
gubernatorial election in Novem-
ber.
"More than just locally, I think
this is going to be a huge campaign
issue, quite frankly," Zemke said.
"My hope is that former congress-
man Mark Schauer gets elected
governor, and he has made it a
point of his campaign to increase
the minimum wage to $9.25."
Bess Anderson, who has worked
at Zingerman's for five months,
said an increase in minimum
wage would lead to a significant
improvement in people's lifestyles.
"A dollar an hour can change
my life significantly from the way
I think about grocery shopping
to what I can do for my family,"
Anderson said.
Many of the employees dis-
cussed their concerns about low
minimum wage in the context
of student loans and going back
to school, adding that minimum
wage job is not enough to pay for
higher education.

art projects will be made possible
by a combination of grants, private
donations and money from the city.
Changes to the ordinance were
made in response to suggestions
from a task force of City Council
members.
AAPAC Chair Bob Miller said
although the City Council now
wants to put Percent for Art funds
back toward things such as sewer
and road repairs, thisuwas not one of
the task force's original recommen-
dations. They did, however, suggest
using some money from Percent for
Art to aid the transition away from
that program.
Miller said the City Council
would like to see AAPAC work with
the city's Capital Improvement
Plan, which will make physical
improvements to Ann Arbor. The
CIP contains a long list of planned
projects, and City Council has asked
AAPAC to make a similar list for
public art and enhanced artwork.
Lumm said to incorporate public
art into upcoming building proj-

"For example, commissions
like the Detroit Engagement
Commission or the Social Justice
Commission are doing great work

and could use more money to fur-
ther their efforts," he wrote. "So

at Zingerman's for six months,
said he has heard arguments
alleging that those who work for
minimum wage are lazy because
they choose to work rather than
pursue a higher education.
"It's sort of a slap in the face
because when I look around this
table, I see every person who's
working here is the opposite of
lazy," Varney said. "Just because
the amount of money you make
per hour is lower than some-
one else's doesn't make you lazy.
In fact, I think it's the opposite.
You're doing a job that nobodyelse
wants to do for $7.50 an hour."
Sanford Bledsoe, owner of The
Espresso Bar in Kerrytown, said
though his business is young, he
has managed to pay his employ-
ees consistently above minimum
wage. He said his decision to pay
his employees an increased wage
stems from his observations of
employees at chain coffee shops.
"People who work in coffee
shops do not usually make much
money. It's eight or nine hours
standing on your feet, living off a
diet of pastries. It's not a sustain-
able job, so I said I'm going to try
and make it one," Bledsoe said.
Dingell said hearing the stories
of Zingerman's employees made
him hopeful that other businesses
will follow in their footsteps to
help improve hourly employees'
economic state.
"You've got to admire them
and you've got to admire Zinger-
man's," Dingell said. "They are
an honest, caring bunch of people
who want to see to it that we do
something which betters the soci-
ety. They also want to do some-
thing that betters the economy."
ects, AAPAC must start planning
early. The ordinance also requires
AAPAC to submit its plans for the
following year to City Council by
Feb.1, but this has not happened yet.
"When we last renewed the con-
tract in August, we were told that,
by year-end, the plan for the public
arts program would be fleshed out,
and we've seen nothing," Lumm
said.
In terms of raising private funds
outside of the CIP, Miller said, "this
is what we're trying totransfer into,
but haven't gotten there yet. We're
looking for more direction on how
to get to that point."
Lumm said being a member of
the city's insurance board provides
her with a personal reminder of the
city's infrastructure needs. She said
through her experience serving on
various art boards, she has become
confident that Ann Arbor is a city
that can successfully fund a public
arts program privately.
Miller said the main focus is to
transition the structure of AAPAC,
and it is up to the City Council to
make decisions concerningits fund-
ing.

increasing the fee wouldn't guar-
antee that the new money would
come directly back to SOFC."
Kibler, who has served on
SOFC, said he enjoyed his work
on the commission, but acknowl-
edged it wasn't easy.
"There are a lot of great orga-
nizations out there," he said. "Our

Obama urges new training
program for fed. workforce

President reiterates
importance of job
improvement
WAUKESHA, Wis. (AP) -
Stressing the importance of hav-
ing job-training programs that
work, President Barack Obama
on Thursday ordered a "soup to
nuts" review of federal work-
force training initiatives and
pledged to copy the most suc-
cessful ones.
Emphasizing themes from
his State of the Union address,
Obama cast improved job train-
ing as central to his efforts to
make it easier for people to move
up into and stay in the middle
class. At a General Electric
engine factory near Milwaukee,
he signed a presidential memo
directing Vice President Joe
Biden to lead the review, and to
work with cities, businesses and
labor leaders to better match
trainingto employer needs.
"Not all of today's good jobs
need a four-year degree. But the
ones that don't need a college
degree do need some specialized
training," Obama said.
Obama said he wants a "soup
to nuts" review because not all

federal job-training programs do
what they're supposed to. He said
he wants to move the government
away from a "train and pray"
approach to job training, where
"you train workers first, and then
you hope theyget ajob."
The findings from the review
will be applied later in the year
to a competition to award $500
million in existing funds to
design programs that pair com-
munity colleges with industry.
Obama called on Congress
to be more reliable in funding
proven programs, while vowing
not to let congressional inaction
stand in the way.
"There are a lot of folks who
do not have time to wait for Con-
gress," Obama said. "They need
to learn new skills right now to
get a new job right now."
House Republicans pushed
back in a letter from Speaker
John Boehner, R-Ohio, and
other GOP leaders to Obama on
Thursday, arguing that Biden's
review was duplicative because
the Government Accountability
Office identified redundancies
in a comprehensive review it
completed in 2011. They urged
Obama to press the Demo-
cratic-led Senate to vote on a
House-passed bill to consolidate


programs and link training to
available jobs.
White House press secretary
Jay Carney couldn't explain how
Biden's review would be differ-
ent from the GAO's, but he said
that whenever Biden "is put in
charge of an effort like this, it
gets done, and it will be effec-
tive."
At a high school later in Ten-
nessee, Obama renewed his call
for Congress to fund an expan-
sion of pre-kindergarten pro-
grams, and touted his pledge to
ensure almost all students have
access to high-speed Internet.
"I want to build on what
works. But to do that, we've got
to reach more kids, and we've got
to do it faster," Obama told stu-
dents at Nashville's McGavock
Comprehensive High School.
Obama also announced
Thursday he's secured com-
mitments from major U.S. com-
panies to support efforts to
increase hiring for the long-term
unemployed, a lingering prob-
lem as the U.S. economy gradu-
ally recovers from recession.
Obama told CNN that Walmart,
Apple and Ford are among the
companies that will participate
in a White House event Friday to
outline the partnership.

A shameful response
The University's failure to respond to public pressure is unacceptable
New information regarding the intricacies of the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act has revealed that the University's recent
behavior in response to Brendan Gibbons' expulsion is deeply
suspicious. In the last two days, the University has neglected any opportunity
to speak out and address the public criticisms directed toward it. Instead,
administrators have invoked a number of furtive internal policies and vaguely

"It's a combination of being sensitive to FERPA, the
law, as well as the University policies that are more
restrictive than FERPA."
- University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said to the Michigan Daily in an
explanation to not discussing disciplinary records of Brendan Gibbons.
A foundation for cooperation

interpreted laws to explain its silence.
At best, this case indicates an unbelievable
lack of communication between University
units. On Nov. 20, 2013, the University's Office
of Student Conflict Resolution signed a docu-
ment stating that the Office of Institutional
Equity determined there was a preponderance
of evidence finding former Michigan kicker
Brendan Gibbons responsible for an incident
of alleged sexual assault in November of 2009.
This meant that the University had already
decided that Gibbons was - in the eyes of the
school - responsible for a sexual misconduct
that was deemed "so severe as to create a hos-
tile, offensive or abusive environment," which
led to his eventual expulsion. Yet three days
later, on Nov. 23, Gibbons was allowed to play
in Michigan's football game against Iowa. He
kicked three extra points for the team.
Unless it is school procedure to allow a stu-
dent-athlete in violation of the Student Sexual
Misconduct Policy to participate in University-
sanctioned athletic events, there was a com-
plete and utter breakdown in communication.
University officials - in OIE, OSCR, the Ath-
letic Department or all three - knowingly
allowed a perpetrator of sexual misconduct
to represent the school in a football game that
undoubtedly generated profit for the Univer-
sity. This is unacceptable on any level.
More specifically, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke's behavior has raised eyebrows in the
public conversation. After OIE found Gibbons.
to be responsible for an act of sexual miscon-
duct, OSCR sent a letter to Gibbons informing
him of his permanent separation from the Uni-
versity. The letter was received and signed by
Gibbons on Dec. 19. By signing the document,
Gibbons waived his right to appeal the sanc-
tion. Athletic Department spokesman Dave
Ablauf confirmed that Gibbons had met with
the department around that time, adding, "That
could have been the time that Brendan Gibbons
talked to coach Hoke." It is possible that the
Athletic Department met with Gibbons without

Hoke, but it seems illogical for the head coach
of the student involved to be uninformed of
the situation. Four days later, on Dec. 23, Hoke
announced that Gibbons would not play in the
Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl due to a "family mat-
ter." The University may have instructed Hoke
to act the way he did in order to adhere to its
ill-reasoned policy and weak interpretation of
FERPA, but someone is still to blame for obfus-
cating the truth.
Doubt in the University's innocence is
sinking in as the administration continues
to withhold answers. Currently, the Univer-
sity's official stance is to cite school policy and
FERPA as reasoning for its decision to decline
comment. However, in an interview with the
Daily, Frank LoMonte, executive director of
the Student Press Law Center, stated that since
Gibbons was determined by University inves-
tigators to be responsible in an allegation of
sexual assault, FERPA does not apply: "They're
just wrongthat FERPA applies to a finding that
a person committed sexual assault." If Gibbons'
violation constitutes a sexual assault rather
than sexual harassment, the University, legally,
cannot use FERPA as an excuse to keep silent.
Given the severity of the punishment,
LoMonte believes that it is "highly doubt-
ful" that Gibbons' actions can be defined as
sexual harassment. In a previous statement,
University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said
the administration was refusing to com-
ment in order to comply with internal poli-
cies "that are more restrictive than FERPA."
Since FERPA does not protect the school in
cases of alleged sexual assault, Fitzgerald is
implying that the school has a policy in place
that allows the University to sit quietly while
its students, alumni and faculty demand
answers. If the University simply refuses to
answer questions, it should say so. Attempting
to broadly - and potentially inaccurately -
interpret laws or school policies as an excuse
for remaining mute is an act of cowardice.

T he scope and size of
the largest municipal
bankruptcy
in U.S. history

bold solutions .
of a similar y
magnitude. it It
looks like that's r
what Judge
Gerald Rosen, ALEXANDER
appointed HERMANN
mediator
of Detroit's
ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, is
currently devising.
On Wednesday, the Detroit Insti-
tute of Art pledged $100 million
toward a fund set aside to protect
the museum's artwork and Detroit
retiree pensions from significant
cuts - assisting Emergency Man-
ager Kevyn Orr's thankless task
of hammering out a compromise
agreeable to the city, its many credi-
tors and ultimately, bankruptcy
judge Steven Rhodes. The money
was pooled with the $370 million
already committed by national and
local foundations, plus an antici-
pated $350 million from the state
championed by Gov. Rick Snyder -
pending a difficult road to approval
in the legislature.
When the Detroit Free Press first
announced Rosen's pursuit of this
"grand bargain" in early December,
with the explicit intention of rais-
ing $500 million from foundations,
I was extremely skeptical of the
apparent pipe dream. After grant
writing for a Detroit-based non-
profit before returning to graduate
school, I learned firsthand how
stingy foundations can be when
presented with new, uncertain
and risky ventures. Further, sim-
ply impacting Detroit's pension
systems - underfunded by $3.5
billion according to city estimates
- enough to appease Rhodes would
require substantial investments.
At the same time, the founda-
tions must avoid jeopardizing the
important work these foundations
already do in Detroit and cities
across the country.

In one sense, the foundations'
commitment to Detroit pensions
and DIA artwork represents an
unprecedented level of regional
cooperation, an elevated arrange-
ment of public-private partnerships
and an impressive expansion of tra-
ditional foundation clout unseen in
Southeast Michigan.
The foundations' acquiescence
is especially surprising when con-
sidering the vast differences in the
foundations themselves - the 10
foundations have starkly varying
geographic interests, programmatic
priorities, budgetary constraints
and ties to Detroit.
The Kresge and Ford Founda-
tions, representing a combined
$225 million pledged to Rosen's
deal, seem like the two most natu-
ral allies. Kresge, based in Troy,
has worked extensively toward
Detroit's revitalization, most vis-
ibly as a primary backer of Detroit
Future City, a near-comprehensive
strategic framework guiding com-
munity development, investment
and charitable givingcitywide. The
Ford Foundation's obvious connec-

That's why Snyder, and even the
DIA itself, should be applauded for
bolstering the foundations' efforts
through near-matchingcommit-
ments - recognizing that what's
good for Detroit is good for the state
as a whole.
In an interview with the Daily,
University Prof. Barry Rabe, direc-
tor of the Center for Local, State
and Urban Policy, said these actions
could potentially be viewed in the
context of increasing metropolitan-
ism in the region. Rabe cites the
Tri-county millage, approved in
2012 by residents of Macomb, Oak-
land and Wayne counties to directly
support the DIA during a period of
uncertain funding for the museum,
the recently created regional trans-
portation authority and current dis-
cussions to develop a regional water
authority as key examples.
At the very least, the foundations'
unprecedented move helps prevent
the collapse of the DIA millage,
which generates $22 million annu-
ally for the museum. Largely due to
Rosen's efforts, current trends dic-
tate that DIA artwork will remain

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

Dear President Coleman,
We are writing to you to voice our con-
cerns about the state of the intellectual cli-
mate on campus. On Jan. 16, Provost Martha
Pollack addressed an e-mail to the Univer-
sity of Michigan community which affirmed
"both the university's" and her "own strong
commitment to diversity and to creating a
welcoming and inclusive community." We
applaud this effort. We question, however,
as any student who has spent time on this
campus must do, what exactly is meant by
"diversity" and "inclusiveness." If, by these
two much-abused terms, you mean primar-
ily race, gender and religion, then we'd ask
that you qualify your future statements about
these matters to "diversity and inclusive-
ness within a narrow set of parameters." If,
however, you meant to affirm your commit-
ment to diversity as it is properly defined - a
condition of being composed of differing ele-
ments or qualities - we ask that you ques-
tion whether your administration has done
an adequate job at promoting such diversity,
and whether Provost Pollack's e-mail did not
leave out gaping holes in the diversity pro-
gram of the University.
As students at the University, we have
become keenly aware that there is a general
underrepresentation of libertarian and con-
servative views on campus. Nearly every
course we have taken has been taught from
a liberal perspective by a liberal professor.
This is troubling not because liberalism is
being promoted on campus, but because of
the general lack of opposing viewpoints stu-
dents have access to. A campus ought to be
a free marketplace of ideas where students
can reevaluate and refine the beliefs that will
shape the rest of their lives. If all schools of
thought are not more equally represented,

many students may never encounter them in a
fair setting. For a university that prides itself
on its supposed liberal values, this is unac-
ceptable. Moreover, it is dishonest.
We would ask that you force students to
take courses that fairly represent libertarian
thought, as you have done with other course
requirements, but we could not do so with-
out forfeiting our character as libertarians.
Rather, we ask simply that you make these
courses available; that, for example, the free
market school of thought be entered into the
economics curriculum tobe taught by compe-
tent and fair free market professors; that his-
tory courses taught from perspectives other
than the postmodern be made available; that
for every course on race and ethnicity, there
be a course on intellectual diversity which
includes liberal, conservative and libertarian
cultural and political ideas.
We ask, additionally, that an increased
budget be developed and extracurricular
programs created to help foster this intellec-
tual diversity outside of the classroom. This
would allow students from across disciplines
to engage in fair-minded and open discussion
with their peers about all ideologies, not just

Dear President Coleman,
I am writing, as a Michigan alum,
to express my great disappointment
and concern regarding the Univer-
sity's handling of the 2009 sexual
assault investigation of Brendan
Gibbons. Even granting the Univer-
sity the most generous benefit of the
doubt, its treatment of this matter
was incompetent and opaque at best.
At worst, the University prioritized
its athletic program over community
safety, willfully subverted a criminal

Folk Fest banks on
revitalized genre

Iron & Wine and
Pearl and the Beard
set to headline
By PAIGE PFLEGER
DailyArts Writer
The last few years have seen
a resurgence in the folk genre;
with on-screen hits like "Inside
Llewyn Davis"
and bands like Ann Arbor
Of Monsters
and Men or Folk Festival
Mumford & Jan.31 to Feb.1
Sons floating

ture. Those Hill Auditorium
whose inter- $47.50-$85
ests have been
piqued by this
rise can get their fix live at the
37th annual Ann Arbor Folk Fes-
tival.
The Ark, a non-profit venue,
started the festival in 1977 as a
fundraiser after they lost finan-
cial support from their backers.
The festival was successful, and
has been recreated annually ever
since, drawing crowds of hun-
dreds of folk loving folks, and fea-
turing artists such as The Head
and The Heart, The Avett Broth-
ers, City and Colour, Ben Folds,
and other indie-folk inspired
artists. This year's headliners
include Iron & Wine, Neko Case,
Ingrid Michaelson, Patty Griffin
and actor-musician Jeff Daniels.
Making their A2 Folk Festi-
val debut is Pearl and the Beard,
an indie-folk trio from New York
City. The group was formed by

accident hack in 2008 when Joc-
elyn Mackenzie, singer and per-
cussionist, met Jeremy Styles,
singer and guitarist, at an open
mic night in the city.
"I was there for happy hour,"
Mackenzie said. "Jeremy was
playing guitar and we met and
started chatting. I sang and wrote
music but had never had anyone
to collaborate with. We started
doing open mics together, and a
few months later we met Emily."
The duo became a trio when
Mackenzie and Styles saw Emily
Hope Price making her debut
singing and playing the cello.
Later that year they released
their first album, God Bless Your
Weary Soul, Amanda Richardson.
The trio joining forces was truly
serendipitous, for each of the
musicians got their start from dif-
ferent parts of the nation: Utah,
New Jersey and California.
"We were strangers before we
were bandmates, and bandmates
before we were friends," Macken-
zie said.
Like most folk staples, the
group began making music with
the instruments they had around
them:guitars, harmonicas, Price's
cello, clappingand of course, their
voices. As the band has matured,
their sound has filled out with
the addition of a wider variety of
instrumentation. The band grew
in popularity, were featured on
NPR's World Caf6 and served
as the opening acts for Ingrid
Michaelson and Ani DiFranco.
"This is our first folk festival
and we're really excited to be part
of such a diverse line-up," Mack-
enzie said. "Each artist in the
line-up is coming from a place of

genuine love for their craft."
Of the musicians they are per-
forming with at the festival, Pearl
and the Beard is most excited
about Neko Case, a performer
that they claim is the source of a
lot of their musical inspiration.
Neko Case's past is rooted in
country music, and she has been
part of numerous bands includ-
ing The New Pornographers.
She has won awards for her solo
work including Female Artist of
the Year at the Plug Independent
Music Awards in 2006, as well
as a few Grammy nominations.
She's consistently praised for
her smoky vocals and beautifully
written music.
"Hopefully we'll run into her. I
would like to give her a high five,"
Styles said.
"Let it be known, for the record,
that I would love to have a beer
with Neko Case," Mackenzie said.
"It would be amazing. I would not
be nervous; I would just be like
'Hey, can I buy you a beer?' and
she could say yes or no."
Other favorites of Pearl and
the Beard include Iron & Wine
and Thao & The Get Down Stay
Down.
Some Michigan grown acts
include Appleseed Collective
fromAnnArbor,The CraneWives
from Grand Rapids and actor Jeff
Daniels ("The Newsroom"), hail-
ing from Chelsea, Michigan.
The Ark's mission statement
says that the organization is
"dedicated to the enrichment
of the human spirit through the
presentation, preservation and
encouragement of folk" and the
star-studded 37th Annual festival
promises to do just that.

From the filter: Kanye
West's fashion falls flat


By ALLEN DONNE
Daily Arts Writer
While Kanye West has found
huge success with the Nike
Air Yeezy - his Louis Vuit-
ton-inspired sneaker, already
in its second iteration - he
always had dreams of designing
clothes.
His infamous 2011 Dw wom-
en's fashion line, however, was
a flop. In every interview Kanye
has done this year, he has rant-
ed about his fashion aspirations
being mocked by critics. Yet, in
spite of these criticisms, this
past summer Kanye partnered
with A.P.C. - the Paris-based
design company famous for its
raw denim - for his first men's
line.
Despite only selling the
basics, including minimal-
ist T-shirts, hoodies and raw
denim jeans, his new line was
fairly successful. Even more
surprising is that the line's high
prices ($120 for the T-shirts,
$280 for the hoodies and $265
for the jeans) didn't prevent the
first Kanye West-A.P.C. collec-
tion from selling out. No shock
then that Kanye chose to work
with A.P.C. again for his new
men's line, set for release in fall
2014.
In the past, Kanye has
expressed his admiration for

Prosecutors seek
death penalty for
Boston bomber

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev
faces death for his
involvement in the
Marathon terrorism
BOSTON (AP) - Federal pros-
ecutors Thursday announced
they will seek the death penalty
against 20-year-old Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev in the Boston Mara-
thon bombing, accusing him of
betraying his adopted country by
ruthlessly carrying outa terrorist
attack calculated to cause maxi-
mum carnage.
U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder's decision to press for
Tsarnaev's execution was widely
expected. The twin blasts last
April killed three people and
wounded more than 260, and
over half the 30 federal charges
against Tsarnaev - including
using a weapon of mass destruc-
tion to kill - carry a possible
death sentence.
"The nature of the conduct
at issue and the resultant harm
compel this decision," Holder
said in a statement of just two
terse and dispassionate sentenc-
es that instantly raised the stakes
in one of the most wrenching
criminal cases Boston has ever
seen.
Tsarnaev has pleaded not
guilty. No trial date has been set.
In a notice of intent filed in
court, federal prosecutors in
Boston listed factors they con-
tend justify a sentence of death
against Tsarnaev, who moved
to the U.S. from Russia about a
decade ago.
"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev received
asylum from the United States;
obtained citizenship and enjoyed
the freedoms of a United States
citizen; and then betrayed his
allegiance to the United States
by killing and raiming ,people
in the United States," read the
notice tFl6'bi"tS. Attorne&Y iar-
men Ortiz.
Prosecutors also cited Tsar-
naev's "lack of remorse" and
allegations that he killed an MIT
police officer as well as an 8-year-

old boy, a "particularly vulner-
able" victim because of his age.
They also said Tsarnaev commit-
ted the killings after "substantial
planning and premeditation."
In addition, they cited his
alleged decision to target the
Boston Marathon, "an iconic
event that draws large crowds of
men, women and children to its
final stretch, making it especially
susceptible to the act and effects
of terrorism."
Tsarnaev's lawyers had no
immediate comment.
In an interview with ABC,
Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat,
who lives in Russia, said: "How
can I feel about this? I feel noth-
ing. I can tell you one thing, that
Ilove my son. I will always feel
proud of him. And t keep loving
him."
Prosecutors allege Tsarnaev,
then 19, and his 26-year-old
brother, ethnic Chechens from
Russia, built and planted two
pressure-cooker bombs near the
finish line of the race to retaliate
against the U.S. for its military
actions in Muslim countries.
The older brother, Tamer-
Ian Tsarnaev, died in a shootout
with police during a getaway
attempt days after the bombing.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was wound-
ed but escaped and was later cap-
tured hiding in a boat parked in a
yard in a Boston suburb.
Authorities said he scrawled
inside the boat such things as
"The US Government is killing
our innocent civilians" and "We
Muslims are one body, you hurt
one you hurt us all."
Killed in the bombings were:
Martin Richard, 8, of Boston;
Krystle Campbell, 29, of Med-
ford; and Lu Lingzi, 23, a Bos-
ton University graduate student
from China. At least 16 others lost
limbs. Tsarnaev is also charged
in the slaying of the MIT officer
and the garjacking of a motor-
ist during the brothers' getaway
attempt.
Campbell's grandmother, Lil-
lian Campbell, said she isn't sure
she supports the death penalty
but fears Tsarnaev will "end up
living like a king" in prison.

House Republicans. discuss outline of
immigration policies during a retreat

GOP divided over
future immigration
plans in upcoming
election year
CAMBRIDGE, Md. (AP) -
House Republicans wrestled
with the outlines of immigra-
tion legislation Thursday night,
sharply divided over the conten-
tious issue itself and the politi-
cal wisdom of acting on it in an
election year.
At a two-day retreat on the
frozen banks of the Choptank
River on Maryland's Eastern
Shore, GOP leaders circulated
an outline that would guide the
drafting of any House Republi-
can legislation on the subject -
a document that Speaker John
Boehner told the rank and file
was as far as the party was will-
ing to go.
It includes a proposed path-
way to legal status for millions
of adults who live in the U.S.
unlawfully - after they payback
taxes and fines - but no special
route to citizenship for them.
Many younger Americans
brought to the country illegally

by their parents would be eligi-
ble for citizenship.
"For those who meet cer-
tain eligibility standards, and
serve honorably in our military
or attain a college degrees, we
will do just that," the statement
said.
The principles also include
steps to increase security at
the nation's borders and work-
places, declaring those a pre-
requisite for any of the other
changes.
Conservatives reacted nega-
tively in advance.
"Intense debate on immigra-
tion inside right now," Rep. Steve
King tweeted as the rank and file
debated the issue behind closed
doors. "3-4 to 1 don't trust the
president and demand he secure
border first." The Iowa Republi-
can is an ardent foe of any chang-
es in legal status for those in the
country unlawfully
Underscoring the complex
political situation, some Demo-
crats reacted hopefully to the
principles, even though the pro-
posal for legal status falls short
of the full citizenship that was
included in a bipartisan measure
that cleared the Senate last year
with the support of President

Barack Obama.
"We have gone from the
Republicans saying 'self-depor-
tation' and 'veto the DREAM
Act,' to saying we need bipar-
tisan solutions," said Rep. Luis
Gutierrez, D-Ill., who has long
advocated an overhaul of exist-
ing laws.
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,
who was involved in drafting
the bill that passed the Senate,
added, "While these standards
are certainly not everything we
would agree with, they leave a
real possibility that Democrats
and Republicans, in both the
House and Senate, can in some
way come together and pass
immigration reform that both
sides can accept. "
The entire subject remains
intensely controversial, particu-
larly among conservatives in
both houses.
Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., who
heads the Republican Study Con-
ference, a group of conservative
lawmakers, repeatedly declined
to say on Thursday whether there
are any circumstances under
which he wouldbe able to support
legislation that bestowed legal
status on adults currently living
in the country illegally.

Another Republican, Rep.
Jason Smith of Missouri, told
reporters that his constituents
"definitely have big concerns
about legalization."
The drive to overhaul immi-
gration laws flagged after the
Senate acted, as House conserva-
tives dug in. The House Judiciary
Committee has approved four
bills, but none has reached the
House floor as conservatives have
expressed concern about being
drawn into an eventual compro-
mise with the White House.
One of thosebills wouldtough-
en enforcement of immigration
laws, including a provision that
would permit local police offi-
cers to enforce them as part of
an attempt to raise the number
of deportations. It also would
encourage immigrants in the
United States illegally to depart
voluntarily, an echo of Mitt Rom-
ney's call for "self-deportation" in
the 2012 presidential race.
Other measures, would cre-
ate a new system for requiring
employees to verify the legal sta-
tus of their workers, establish a
new temporary program for farm
workers and expand the number
of visas for employees in technol-
ogy industries.

throat had been slit and she had
been sexually assaulted.
Knox and Sollecito denied
any involvement in the killing,
insisting they were at Sollecito's
apartment that night, smoking
marijuana, watching a movie
and making love.
Prosecutors originally argued
that Kercher was killed in a
drug-fueled sex game gone awry
- an accusation that gave the
case a lurid cast that fascinated
the European tabloids and led to
headlines about "Foxy Knoxy"
and her sex life.
But at the third trial, prosecu-
tors argued instead that the vio-
lence stemmed from arguments
between roommates Knox and
Kercher about cleanliness and
was triggered by a toilet left
unflushed by the third defen-
dant in the case, Rudy Guede.
Guede, who is from the Ivory
Coast, was convicted in a sepa-
rate trial and is serving a 16-year
sentence for the murder.
Legal experts have said it is
unlikely that Italy will request
Knox's extradition before the
verdict is final.

Murphy's

By JUSTIN MEYER
Daily Sports Writer
Brian Murphy hung his head
between his knees, having just
lost a state championship. All
that had separated him from his
first Illinois high-school state
title was a one-point escape.
But when the clock expired,
his opponent, current University
of Illinois wrestler Kyle
Langenderfer, threw up two
fingers on each hand to tell
Assembly Hall that he was
a repeat champion, Michael
Jordan-style.
"This next match means
everything," Murphy had said
to the Chicago Tribune before
the final. "I want to finish out
with a high-school career I can
remember. It won't be that way
unless Iwin this match."
The next few months began
a journey to Michigan for the
former Glenbard North High
School starting quarterback
and wrestling star. For all the
success he had in high school,
the nation's 27th-ranked recruit
still had plenty left to prove.
Murphy, now a freshman,
was one of the first commits in
Michigan's top-ranked recruiting
class, thanks in no small part to
his work with his longtime coach
and current Wolverines assistant
Sean Bormet.
"IknewthatIwasgoingtobe a
wrestler in college my freshman

said. "I knew it really early."
The Carol Stream, Ill. native
began wrestling and playing
football in the first grade. It
was wrestling he would fall in
love with, but only after his dad
assured him that there was no
punching or kicking involved.
Murphy started attending
Bormet's summer wrestling
camps and built himself into a
nationally renowned competitor,
having particular success in
national freestyle competitions
in high school.
Murphy and Bormet began
working together when Murphy
was in middle school, and the duo
hasn't looked back since. Since
arriving on campus, Murphy
has defeated the eighth-, 14th-
and 19th-ranked wrestlers in
the 157-pound weight class,
suffered an overtime loss to

long uest for a championship
Michigan a natural extension of
the sport Murphy grew up with.
"The thing about college is that
the people I'm wrestling with, it's
just a completely different level,"
Murphy said. "In high school I
would pretty much handle all of
my partners. Now there will be
practices where I'm just getting
my butt kicked by some of these
guys, and it's great."
The top-level competition in
practice will serve Murphy well
for the formidable schedule
ahead of Michigan (4-0 BigTen,
8-2 overall), which will face No.
12 Ohio State on Friday and No.

Murphy, though, the schedule

Meet to promote awareness

By CINDY YU
Daily Sports Writer
"Take him home and make
him comfortable."
Those were the words the
doctor said to former gymnast
Jill Leone - a friend of Michigan
assistant coach Dave Kuzara -
when her son, John, was born
with autism. But rather than
heeding the doctor's advice,
Jill sought alternative therapy
techniques to treat him.
Fast-forward 17 years to
an exceptionally successful
John Leone. A junior at Grosse
Pointe North High School,
he's involved in competitive
swimming, loves physics, has a
4.0 GPA and tutors his peers.
Leone recently paid a visit to
the University to speak to the No.
4 Michigan women's gymnastics
team. He detailed his experiences
living with autism, recalling a
time when he was unable to speak.
While visiting with the team,
Leone had the opportunity
to practice in the Donald R.
Shepherd Women's Gymnastics
Training Center. Persistence
and hard work led him to learn
a swivel hips move - where the
individual performs a seat drop
in one direction followed by a
180-degree twist to perform
another seat drop in the opposite
direction - on the trampoline in
only one session.
The Wolverines were
inspired by Leone's visit, and
responded by dedicating one
of their rivalry matches to
the cause. Michigan (1-0 Big
Ten, 6-0 overall) will host
the Spartans in its inaugural
Autism Awareness Meet at
Crisler Center on Friday night,
and Leone will be in the stands,
wearing maize and blue and
cheering on the team that
welcomed him with open arms.

After 51 days, Wolverines
finally host contest at Yost

ALUSON FARRAND/Daily
Coach Bev Plocki's team will host the Spartans and promote autism awareness.

Through video presentations,
pamphlets and exhibition
performances from special-
needs athletes, the meet will
teach attendees about the most
underfunded - yet fastest-
growing - developmental
disorder.
"The statistics about how
much more prevalent autism
has become are staggering," said
Michigan coach Bev Plocki.
Twenty years ago, individuals
with autism were offered fewer
opportunities to succeed after
their diagnosis. Resources made
available in the last two decades
to people with the disorder have
helped to bridge the gap, but the
limited-opportunity issue is one
that persists to this day.
"We're just really excited to
be a part of something that really
has the opportunity to make a
difference," said senior Teresa
Arthur. "It has allowed us to get
a lot more educated on autism,
what it is and how it affects
people. It really opened our eyes

to what other people are going
through and making sure we
take the time to think about how
we're judging other people or
how our lives are."
Though this is the inaugural
Autism Awareness Meet at
Michigan, Plocki and Dr.
Larry Nassar, a physician for
USA Gymnastics, have been
collaborating on the project for
much longer.
Particularly drawn to the
disorder because of his autistic
daughter, Nassar revolutionized
the merger of autism awareness
with women's gymnastics.
He founded the Gymnastics
Doctor Foundation to assist
with research concerning
movement therapy and cognitive
development of autism.
Nassar is currently
spearheading a project to train
gymnastics instructors through
the lens of special education to
hold sessions in gyms that are
often empty or underutilized
during the day.

of a friendly
crowd.
"It's going to be a good team,
a good test at home," Compher
said Monday. "To get the fans
in here, it's going to be a fun
weekend."
Compher, the Big Ten First
Star of the Week, tallied five
points - three goals and two
assists - against Michigan
State and will likely be on the
ninth-ranked Badgers' radar
this weekend. He's tied for
second among Big Ten freshmen
with 20 points, and tied for
second in the nation with three
shorthanded goals.
Riding Compher's hot
streak, the Wolverines (4-2-0
Big Ten, 12-6-2 overall) may
have reignited an offense that
ranked among the nation's best
in October. Compher anchored

a line with senior forward Derek
DeBlois and junior forward Alex
Guptill, a trio that was broken
up after midseason struggles.
What's more, Michigan's newest
line - one with sophomore
forward Boo Nieves and junior
forward Phil Di Giuseppe -
was the difference in the game
Thursday at Joe Louis Arena.
ButunlikethatoftheSpartans,
Wisconsin's defense ranks
among the top 10 nationally in
blocked shots and penalty kills.
Though the new line pairings
netted five goals for the firsttime
since Dec. 2, the Badgers (5-3-0,
14-7-1) will provide a truer test
of the Wolverines' offensive
improvements.
"Coach has talked about the
fact that we have to block shots,"
Compher said. "It's something
we did a good job of against
Michigan State. It's something
that they do well, so we want
our defense to move around
and get shots on net, and for our
forwards to be blocking shots."
For two equally skilled
programs, home-ice advantage
could prove vital. Michigan has
dropped only one game at home
- Oct. 26 to UMass-Lowell.
Meanwhile, the Badgers come
in after losing their second home
contest of the year to Ohio State
last weekend.
"We're not going to out-skill
anyone," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "We just have to
play the right way, play stingy,
and we have to be opportunistic.
Freshman goaltender
Zach Naagelvort has been an
exemplar of that opportunistic
attitude Berenson preaches,
and capitalized once again this

weekend. Thursday, Berenson
said Nagelvoort had earned his
fifth consecutive start.
But while the Children of
Yost will certainly welcome
Michigan back with open arms,
there promises to be no love lost
between these two teams.
Two weeks ago, facing an
inevitable sweep in Madison,
sophomore forward Andrew
Copp shoved a Wisconsin player
into the boards and onto his back.
As he skated away, the Badgers
swarmed Copp before punches
were thrown and helmets went
flying. The scramble resulted in
four ejections, including Copp,
DeBlois and Guptill.
"It's not something I'll be
worried about," Copp said.
"I don't know, I might have
to watch my back a little
throughout the series or
whatnot, but it's just something
that happened at the time."
The 51-day absence from
Yost should guarantee excited
fans, but it might not mean
packed stands. With puck drop
scheduled for 6:30 p.m., rather
than 7:10 or later, Berenson is
hopeful that fans will take note
of the time change.
"This is going to be a fun
weekend," Berenson said. "We
have to let everyone know so
they get to the starts on time.."
With a stretch of seven
games in six weeks, and 52 days
on the road behind them, the
Wolverines will finally get back
into a Friday-Saturday gameday
rhythm as they head into the
thick of their Big Ten schedule.

Boiler Broken: Wolverines avoid home upset

Michigan 8-0 in Big
Ten play for first
time since '76-77
By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Last Saturday in East Lansing,
freshman guard Derrick Walton
Jr. dropped 19 points and shed
the title of an uneasy freshman.
Thursday night, he continued
to mature
as the PURDUE 66
Michigan MICHIGAN 75
men's
basketball team downed Purdue,
75-66, for its 10th straight win.
Walton shot 4-for-5 in the
first half for nine of his 14 points.
More importantly, though, he
helped quarterback an offense
that came out of the gate slowly.
The 10th-ranked Wolverines
missed their first three field
goals and turned the ball over
eight times in the first period,
and 16 times on the night.
"Sixteen turnovers in a
game?" said Michigan coach
John Beilein. "I don't recall the
last time one of our teams won
with 16 turnovers."
Fifth-year senior Jordan
Morgan came down with his
own rebound from a miss and
put it through the cylinder to
give Michigan (8-0 Big Ten, 16-4
overall) its first points two-and-
a-half minutes into the game.
Two possessions later, Walton
buried a 3-pointer from the
corner, setting off a 14-4 run for
the Wolverines.
The Boilermakers (3-4, 13-8)
didn't let Michigan run away
with the game in the first half,
though. After sophomore guard
Nik Stauskas threw down a dunk
to give the Wolverines a 10-point
lead, they fell flat on offense.
Michigan missed three straight
shots and turned the ball over
four times in the following three
and a half minutes. On the other
end, they switched into a three-

quarter-court zone defense which
Purdue easily gashed, allowing
the Boilermakers to climb back
and take a brief one-point lead.
Beilein said his assistant
coaches convinced him to
experiment with the zone
defense, but he still isn't sure of
its upside.
A Walton layup with eight
minutes left in the half finally
snapped the dry spell, and an
assist to Morgan a minute later
for a dunkswungthe momentum
back toward Michigan. As time
expired at the end of the first
20 minutes, Walton split the
Boilermakers' defense and finger
rolled in two points to send the
Wolverines into the locker room
with a 37-29 lead.
"I think his passing has
gotten so much better," Morgan
said of Walton. "Coach Beilein
talks about the difference
between running the play and

being a player, and he's been
kinda finding that little soft spot
in between."
Added Beilein: "Those were
shots that a No. 3 (Trey Burke)
used to hit last year for us over
and over again."
Michigan shot 9-of-10 from
the field to begin the second half.
It stretched an eight-point lead to
17 points and never lookedback.
Stauskas was limited to just
three shots beyond the arc but
still had a game-high 16 points
on 5-of-10 shooting. Purdue
coach Matt Painter said he
focused on limiting Stauskas
and sophomore forward Glenn
Robinson III, forcing him to
have a weaker defender cover
sophomore guard Caris LeVert.
Purdue ended the game on a
10-2 run, but the Wolverines had
built up too large of a lead and
held on to remain unbeaten in
Big Ten play.

LeVert delivers with
first double-double
By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Last year in Big Ten play,
Caris LeVert collected 19
rebounds. Total.
Divide that by 18 games and
you getan average of1.1per game.
But on Thursday night against
Purdue, the sophomore guard
gathered nine rebounds in the
first half alone.
Finishing with a career-high
11 boards to go with 14 points
- good for his first career
double-double - LeVert finally
interrupted an odd streak of his
own that has existed throughout
the Michigan men's basketball
team's 10-game winning streak
and the past 11 games.
While the 10th-ranked

Wolverines have played well over
the stretch, the inconsistency of
LeVert's play has stood out.
Following a 17-point, eight-
rebound performance against
Michigan State last Saturday,
LeVert figured to be vital in
Michigan's four-shooters-and-
a-center lineup against Purdue
(3-5 Big Ten, 13-8 overall), the
17th-leading rebounding squad in
the nation.
And he was. Collecting boards
off misses - nine of the defensive
variety - LeVert proved pivotal
in a game defined as much by
Michigan's offensive firepower
as it was by its sloppiness. The
Wolverines committed a season-
high 16 turnovers.
"It was going to be one of those
nights where the guards would
have to come in and clean up for
us,"said fifth-year senior forward
Jordan Morgan.
LeVert has proven his ability to

be the Wolverines' No. 1 scoring
option as well as their second
and third option on nights when
sophomore guard Nik Stauskas
has taken over games.
Michigan coach John
Beilein hasn't spent much time
complaining about Levert's
inconsistency since Michigan
(8-0 Big Ten, 16-4 overall)
started winning big games, but
in the games LeVert did score, his
rebounding followed.
Before Thursday, LeVert had
averaged 15.6 points and 5.5
rebounds in games he scored
10 points or more. While that
irregularity can be cited easily
when discussing LeVert's play,
Beilein knows that a night like
LeVert had Thursday ranges back
to last year, when Beilein realized
he had to burn LeVert's redshirt.
"It's the same thing we've seen
with Caris in practice this last
year," Beilein said. "We needed to
burn this redshirt. He does these
thingsandhe'splayingoffresidual
action like (sophomore forward
Glenn Robinson III) did last year.
He just finds spots. There's very
few things called for him, other
than he's in space where he can
attack or get open for 3's. Getting
him to become a knockdown
shooter has been important."
LeVert's game relies on him
finding open looks, and Beilein's
strategy tries to deliver them.
With Stauskas playing so well
and freshman guard Derrick
Walton Jr. coming on as a second
option, LeVert hasn't needed to
have a scoring 'outburst every
game for Michigan to succeed.
With LeVert focusing on
defense Thursday - he tallied
two blocks and three steals -
Michigan thrived on offense,
shooting61percent fromthe field
on the game.
Acting as that third scorer,
LeVert snapped his streak
of inconsistency and helped
Michigan further separate
itself from the crowded armada
of teams in the middle of the
Big Ten.

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Sophomore guard Caris LeVert committed four of Michigan's 16 turnovers, but he finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds for the first double-double of his career.

U-1MWs ConfuciusInstitute Wins Award
4
China's Vice Premier Madam Liu Yandong and Senior Vice Provost Lester Monts at the award
ceremony in Beijing, China.
The Confucius Institute at the University of Michigan (CIUM) was honored as a Con-
fucius Institute of the Year (2013), along with other 27 similar institutions. Senior Vice
Provost Lester Monts accepted the award at the 8th Global Confucius Institute Confer-
ence, which was held in Beijing, China on December 7th and 8th, 2013. Awarded by the
Office of Chinese Language Council International (Hanban), the honor distinguishes
CIUM among 440 Confucius Institutes in 120 countries, acknowledging its excellent
performance in promoting Chinese arts and culture and U-M China exchanges.
"There are more than four hundred Confucius Institutes located around the world. It is
a grand distinction for CIUM to receive the Confucius Institute of the Year award. The
University established the Confucius Institute a mere four years ago. With an emphasis
on Chinese arts and culture, its recent rise to international prominence within that short
time span is breathtaking. The award recognizes the University of Michigan for the
central role it places on the arts," Monts said.
Partnering with Renmin University of China, CIUM promotes Chinese culture and arts
by presenting a variety of academic and cultural activities throughout the academic year,
which include concerts, distinguished lectures, exhibitions, round table discussions, and
theatrical performances. CIUM brings many top Chinese artists to campus and their
presentations always show China's best. One exemplary event in 2013 was the "To See
the Invisible" a series of events which included an exhibition of avante garde costumes,
a fashion show, a lecture and a roundtable-discussion. Professor Xu Rui, the featured
artist of the event, is the chair of the fashion design department in the Central Academy
of Fine Arts, China, and an internationally renowned fashion designer and scholar. The
series of events was highly praised by U-M art faculty, students, and local community
members.
In addition to its presentations, CIUM sponsors free classes/workshops on Chinese
musical instruments, Chinese folk songs, Chinese cuisine, and Chinese martial arts,
providing hand-on opportunities for U-M students to experience Chinese culture and
arts. Developing U-M's exchanges with China, CIUM periodically organizes China
performances/tours by U-M faculty and students. To further achieve its goals, CIUM
made, in 2013, new partnerships with two prestigious schools in Beijisg, namely the Clii-
na Conservatory of Music and Central Academy of Fine Arts. These new partnerships
will create tremendous opportunities for research and learning/teaching for faculty and
students. Looking forward, CIUM will continue to provide high cuality program to the
U-M and Michigan communities in southeast Michigan and beyond.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Michigan looks to rebound
vs.struggling Minnesota

Wolverines haven't
lost two in a row
since last season
By SHANNON LYNCH
DailySports Writer
For the Michigan women's
basketball team, bouncing back
has never been more important.
After suffering a demoralizing
85-54 loss
to No. 24 Minnesota
Nebraska on
Wednesday at Michigan
night, the Matchup:
Wolverines' Minnesota
ability to 13-9; Michigan
overcome 14-7
adversity will When:
be tested this Saturday
weekend. 12 P.M.
Michigan Where:
has yet to lose Crisler Arena
back-to-back TV/Radio:
games this BTN
season, but
that record will
be on the line come Saturday as it
plays host to Minnesota (2-6 Big
Ten, 13-9 overall), which has lost
five of its last six away games.
The Golden Gophers have
fallen to last place in the
Big Ten conference, while
Michigan (5-3, 14-7) sits more
comfortably in a tie with Iowa
and Purdue for third place.
Though Minnesota doesn't
seem like a major threat on
paper, the Wolverines are
heading into their third
conference game in just a week,
and the schedule and travel
have been taxing.
"I think this is really going

to test our toughness," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "That's going to be a sign
for our team as to where we are
and how resilient we are."
The Golden Gophers lead
the all-time series, 31-25, but
Michigan has won three of the
last six. Last season's matchup
holds many similarities to
Saturday's game - the teams
met at the end of January, and
Michigan had yet to lose back-
to-back games in that season.
Minnesota snapped that record
in 2013 with a home victory over
the Wolverines, 82-67.
The Golden Gophers are led
on offense by guard Rachel
Banham, who averages 21
points. She was named to the
Big Ten Player of the Week
Honor Roll earlier this month
after scoring 32 points at Iowa
and then 28 points days later in
a victory over Northwestern.
"She runs the point, so
she can do multiple things -
shoot the three, take you off
the bounce, post you up, and
they have two inside kids that
are really dominant," Barnes
Arico said. "I think one of
them is leading the league in
rebounding, so it will be an
interesting matchup for (junior
forward) Cyesha Goree inside
to see, and (senior forward) Val
Driscoll, how we handle their
inside presence."
Another player who will
pose a threat to the Wolverines
on both ends of the court is
Amanda Zahui. The 6-foot-5
Swedish center is averaging
14.2 points and 10.5 rebounds,
and her height will give the
Golden Gophers a major
advantage in the paint. The

Wolverines will need to be
aggressive and disciplined to
keep the ball out of her hands
in critical situations.
Since Minnesota holds the
overall height advantage - not
a single player stands shorter
than 5-foot-9 - Barnes Arico
will likely start her larger
lineup of Driscoll, Goree and
junior forward Nicole Elmblad.
All three have been valuable
in terms of setting up blocks
and knocking down shots
consistently for the Wolverines
this season.
But for Michigan to have
success againstMinnesota, Goree
willhave to cut down on her fouls
in order for her team to maintain
abiglineup on the court.
Freshman Siera Thompson
recently set the record for most
3-pointers from a freshman
in Michigan history with 50,
but junior guard Shannon
Smith still leads the team in
scoring, averaging 14.4 points.
Smith has struggled as of late
to break through heightened
defensive pressure, but she and
Thompson will need to rely on
their longer shots to help open
up the field on offense.
The Wolverines have
consistently shown resilience
after losses this season, and
every defeat has resulted
in quick improvements and
increased motivation inside the
Michigan locker room.
If the Wolverines can sink
jumpers, grab rebounds and
manage the pressure inside the
paint - all things they failed
to do against Nebraska - the
team will likely be able to stifle
Minnesota's defense and be in
good position to pull outa win.
