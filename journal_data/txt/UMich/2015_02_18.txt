Students examine 
diversity and beliefs 
through open-mic 

performances

By LAURA SCHINAGLE

For the Daily

As part of the LSA Honors Pro-

gram’s second annual Diversity 
Monologues, students gathered 
in South Quad’s Java Blue Cafe 
on Tuesday evening for open-mic 
style performances based on the 
theme, “This I Believe.”

The Monologue series aims 

to facilitate conversation about 
identity and diversity through 
open-mic events. The theme was 
inspired by a similar National 

Public Radio program of the 
same name. Clips from the NPR 
program were played to bookend 
the performances.

LSA senior Harleen Kaur, a 

Diversity Monologues co-found-
er and event organizer, said she 
and others came up with the idea 
during the peak of social activism 
movements on campus last year, 
such as #BBUM and #UMDivest.

“We were talking about how 

to bring these conversations of 
identity and diversity to Honors 
in a very safe space and a creative 
space that would be very sup-
portive for those who are choos-
ing to share their experiences,” 
Kaur said.

Organizers said the theme of 

Tuesday’s event was purpose-
fully vague to cast a wide net 

Assembly also 
discusses course 
evaluation data

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

During Central Student Gov-

ernment’s Tuesday meeting, the 
body considered a proposal to 
create a new University spirit 
song and discussed a resolution 
that would request the Univer-
sity release results from student-
completed course evaluations.

After prompting discussion 

at last week’s CSG meeting, the 
topic of “Hail and Unite” — a 

National data 
shows salaries 

may skew in favor 
of men, ‘U’ data 

suggests otherwise

By ALLANA AKHTAR 

and RACHEL PREMACK

Daily Staff Reporters

The University’s adminis-

tration exhibited an intriguing 
quality in 2013: a large amount 
of female representation.

Twenty-five of the 41 top 

positions at the University, 
including three of the highest 
positions — president, provost 
and executive vice president for 
medical affairs — were held by 
women in 2013.

Though President Emerita 

Mary Sue Coleman has since 
retired and Ora Pescovitz, exec-
utive vice president for medical 
affairs, stepped down last year, 
women hold about half of the 
University’s executive officer 
seats.

However, data from the Uni-

versity’s 2014 salary report, 
released in December, indicates 
that only two women held a spot 

on the list of top 10 highest-paid 
University executives.

The University’s compen-

sation philosophy specifically 
outlines an aim to “(a)ttract, 
retain, reward and motivate the 
productivity and commitment 
of highly qualified, diverse fac-
ulty and staff.” The statement 
also promises the University 
does not “practice, or tolerate, 
unlawful 
discrimination 
in 

pay.”

This piece examines whether 

a discrepancy in base salaries 
between male and female exec-
utives exists within the Univer-
sity’s administration. Doing so 
required extensive data analy-
sis — namely, comparing the 
salaries of more than 40 posi-
tions across the University.

These positions include, but 

are not limited to, the executive 
vice presidents, deans and pro-
vosts. This article also analyzes 
the salaries of executives at 11 
other top colleges with which 
the University competes for 
faculty.

Ultimately, 
this 
article 

attempts to determine whether 
or not instances of compara-
tively higher salaries for male 
executives are anomalies, or if 
there is a traceable wage gap 
within the University’s leader-

ship. Simply — is the University 
adhering to its own philosophy?

Though 
salaries 
from 
a 

sample of a dozen peer institu-
tions appear to illustrate wage 
discrepancies based on gender, 
a Michigan Daily analysis of 
compensation for top Univer-
sity officials shows the gap may 
not be statistically significant 
among University executives.

The Provost: A case study
Perhaps the most notable 

salary trend in the University 
administration is that of the 
provost.

In 2006, Teresa Sullivan 

became the University’s pro-
vost after having served as a 
vice provost, vice president and 
graduate dean for the Univer-
sity of Texas at Austin. She had 
also been the executive vice 
chancellor for academic affairs 
for the entire University of 
Texas system.

Sullivan’s base salary at the 

University was $340,000. By 
the time she stepped down in 
2010, it had grown to $366,331. 
President 
Emerita 
Coleman 

appointed Philip Hanlon to suc-
ceed Sullivan when she depart-
ed to assume the University of 
Virginia presidency in 2010.

MONOLOGUES! 
SNOW DAY

Boston University will offer 

Saturday classes this semester 
to make up for a high number of 
snow days.

Over the last 30 days, the Bos-

ton area has accumulated about 
73.3 inches of snow, The Daily 
Free Press reported. The univer-
sity canceled five of the semes-
ter’s 18 days thus far. To help 
professors and students catch up 
with the time missed, the univer-
sity created an opportunity for 
classes to be held on two Satur-
days.

Professors are allowed to 

require attendance, but profes-
sors and students are expected to 
work together to alleviate sched-
uling conflicts.

The semester’s five snow days 

broke Boston University records.

University of Kansas students 

fight back against tweet

Earlier this month, the Twitter 

account for the Jayhawk Buddy 
System, a university-sponsored 
risk management initiative, post-
ed an offensive tweet that drew 
widespread negative feedback 
from students.

The tweet stated: “S/O to all 

those (mostly ladies I might add) 
who are getting their road work 
in this am.”

University of Kansas students 

responded to the tweet, arguing it 
was sexist and offensive, The Uni-

versity Daily Kansan reported. 
Students said they believed the 
tweet was aimed toward women 
making the “walk of shame.”

The account is directly associ-

ated with the school, and tweeted 
in defense, “This account has 
always focused on the positive 
behaviors of students and that 
post was no different.”

The 
account’s 
moderators 

claimed that the tweet was aimed 
at those who were motivated to 
be out exercising.

The original tweet has been 

deleted and university officials 
are investigating the source and 
reason behind it.

Universities earn $5 million 
grant for long-term research

‘U’ joins 14 colleges 

to offer multi-
year projects for 
undergraduates

By EMMA KILBANE

For the Daily 

A group of 15 institutions, 

including the University, have 
received a $5 million grant to 

fund long-term research oppor-
tunities for undergraduate and 
master’s students.

The grant, funded by the 

Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley 
Charitable Trust, will establish 
the Vertically Integrated Proj-
ects consortium, an expansion of 
a similar research program cur-
rently running on campus. The 
Helmsley Trust, in part, aims to 
increase the diversity and num-
ber of students entering STEM 
fields upon graduation.

The VIP consortium would 

allow groups of approximately 
10 to 30 students to conduct 
research with leading faculty 
researchers — projects that could 
continue throughout a student’s 
undergraduate 
career, 
rather 

than just a semester or academic 
year.

There are currently eight 

long-term research teams at the 
University, and with additional 
funding the University hopes to 
effectively double that number 
within three years. The expan-
sion could result in the creation 
of nearly 300 student research 
positions.

Gail Hohner, managing direc-

tor of the College of Engineer-
ing’s Multidisciplinary Design 
Program, said VIP projects typi-
cally include elements of design, 
building and testing.

“The process of conducting 

research is highly iterative, with 
many attempts failing before 
success is identified,” she said. 
“Students will have an active role 
in each iteration, learning along 
with the faculty where successes 
might be found, and where they 
won’t. This level of involvement 
is only possible in a multi-term 
engagement.”

For undergraduates, the proj-

ects present opportunities to 
assume leadership positions, as 
well as a chance to form a strong 
foundation in research. The proj-
ects are engineering based, but 
students from all disciplines are 
encouraged to apply, as many 
involve a variety of roles.

University teams are current-

ly working to model Great Lakes 
water flows, develop connected 
vehicle 
technology 
and 
test 

smartphone-sized spacecraft.

Engineering freshman Sarah 

Peterson said she is interested 
in pursuing more long-term 
research opportunities at the 
University, making this project 
particularly appealing.

“I’m 
not 
currently 
doing 

research, but I feel like if there 
was a way to stay with one proj-

City Council considers adopting 
road improvement resolution

If passed, the plans 
could reduce traffic 
and foster economic 

development

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOLOUS

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor City Council 

convened Tuesday evening to dis-
cuss a number of issues, includ-
ing a resolutions to adopt the 
Reimagine Washtenaw Corridor 
Improvement Study and another 
proposal to proceed with the 
Housing Affordability and Equity 
Analysis.

After a lengthy deliberation, 

City Council decided to postpone 
the vote to adopt the Reimagine 
Washtenaw Corridor Improve-
ment Study. Councilmember Jane 
Lumm (I–Ward 2) suggested the 
vote be postponed until April 20.

The 18-month study recom-

mends changes be made in the 
Washtenaw 
Avenue 
corridor, 

including the addition of a wide 
median cross boulevard section, a 

four travel lane with wide median 
and biking lanes and the inclusion 
of “The Michigan Left Turns” for 
wide median segments.

The plan aims to reduce traf-

fic and further foster economic 
development for the business in 
the area. The study asks for the 
participation of nearby regions 
including the city of Ann Arbor, 
Pittsfield Township, city of Ypsi-
lanti and Ypsilanti Township.

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 

Taylor (D) supported the adop-
tion of the plan and voted against 
postponing the vote to adopt the 
resolution, noting the study’s rec-
ommendations are not binding.

Several councilmembers were 

concerned about a number of 
issues with the resolution. One of 
the primary concerns expressed 
by 
multiple 
councilmembers 

was that many business owners 
affected by the resolution were 
not consulted on the matter.

Councilmember Stephen Kun-

selman (D–Ward 3), who favored 
postponing the vote, said these 
recommendations 
could 
take 

parking spaces away from stores. 
He said the money for the proj-
ect should instead be used to fix 

roads.

“There are too many driveway 

cuts on Washtenaw for a boule-
vard and the Michigan Left to 
work,” Kunselman said. “You are 
not going able to service every 
driveway or business that is along 
Washtenaw.”

Councilmember 
Graydon 

Krapohl (D–Ward 4) said he 
favored adopting the resolution 
because the study acts as a map 
guiding the city’s direction for the 
corridor.

“To go down the continued 

path that we are (in), to have 
Washtenaw as it is would be a 
complete disaster,” Krapohl said. 
“I mean it’s not going to get better. 
It’s not going to improve.”

Despite postponing a vote on 

the study, City Council approved 
the adoption of the Housing 
Affordability and Equity Analysis 
with a vote of 10 to one.

The analysis supports building 

3,139 affordable housing units in 
Ann Arbor and Pittsfield Town-
ship until 2035. It also suggests 
building 4,178 new middle class 
households in Ypsilanti.

for anyone seeking to explore the 
broad concept of belief.

LSA senior Essie Shachar-Hill, a 

co-organizer of the event, said they 
did not want to limit performances 
to established faiths and religions.

“Originally we were thinking 

something along the lines of faith 
and religion,” Shachar-Hill said. 
“We wanted to be inclusive of 
people who don’t necessarily have 
a faith or religion.”

She said she thinks the way 

organizers framed the theme was 
effective in achieving the original 
goal of the Diversity Monologues.

“There was a really good variety 

of viewpoints,” Shachar-Hill said. 
“It’s called the Diversity Mono-
logues so it’s always great when we 
have diverse points of view.”

The nine performers employed 

a variety of styles. Several shared 
personal narratives about how 
their upbringings and personal 
experiences shaped their identi-
ties, and some read and performed 
pieces of other literary modes.

junior 
Ahmad 

Sakallah said his performance was 
a mix of a ballad and a poem. He 
said the event provided him a plat-
form to express his beliefs about 
diversity.

“This school is kind of ‘token 

diversity’ at this point and I really 
want more unity,” Sakallah said. 
“I’m trying to spread awareness 
without making people upset.”

He said his performance was 

based on personal experience liv-
ing in America as a Palestinian-
American and frustration with the 
difficulties of achieving true toler-
ance.

“When I say, ‘talk about that 

they hate that they fake,’ you know, 
my Palestinian heritage, every-
one that I know is Palestinian says 
Jewish people are lying and all my 
Jewish friends say Palestinians 
are lying,” Sakallah said. “I’m just 
caught in the middle.”

LSA senior Leela Denver read a 

poem she wrote called “Summer 
in Phulgaon.” She said the poem 
explored her identity through her 
relationship with her mother and 
her ties to India, where her mother 
was raised.

“I grew up in a mixed race 

household, so it wasn’t just Indian, 
although that was the prominent 
culture in my household,” she said. 
“I definitely feel like that complete-
ly changed my experience as an 
American.”

Kaur said the next Diversity 

Monologues event will be held 
April 1, and the theme will relate to 
gender and sexual orientation.

versity as a math professor and 
was promoted to associate dean 
for planning and finance in LSA 
in 2001. He also served as the 
vice provost of academic and 
budgetary affairs from 2004 to 
2010.

As provost, he received a 

starting salary of $470,000, 
which increased to $509,292 by 
2012.

Hanlon’s starting salary was 

more than $100,000 greater 
than Sullivan’s ending salary, 
and it increased by an additional 
$100,000 in half the time it had 
taken for Sullivan’s to increase 
$20,000.

At the time of Hanlon’s pro-

motion, Kelly Cunningham, then 
a University spokesperson who 
now serves as a special coun-
sel to the provost, said the wage 
discrepancy was due to higher 
provost salaries among peer insti-
tutions across the board.

“As is often the case, the Uni-

versity Human Resources Office 
conducted phone surveys among 
peer institutions to determine the 
appropriate market rate,” Cun-
ningham wrote in a 2010 e-mail 
interview with the Daily.

Hanlon left to serve as the 

president of Dartmouth College 
in 2013, at which point current 
University Provost Martha Pol-
lack was promoted to the position.

Before coming to the Univer-

sity in 2000, Pollack worked at 
the University of Pittsburgh as a 
professor of computer science and 
intelligent systems and as direc-
tor of the University’s Intelligent 
Systems Program. She came to 
the University as a professor of 
computer science and engineer-
ing, and served as an associate 
chair for that department from 
2004 to 2007. In 2007, she became 
dean of the School of Informa-
tion, and held that role until 2010. 
Before her appointment to serve 
as provost, she was vice pro-
vost for academic and budgetary 
affairs from 2010 to 2013 — the 
same position Hanlon held before 
his promotion.

When Pollack took office, 

the provost’s salary decreased 
by nearly $60,000 — her salary, 
which opened at $450,000, has 
since been raised to $460,800. 
This is still less than Hanlon’s 
starting salary in 2010.

Hanlon held a place on the top 

10 list of highest paid employees 
for each year of his tenure. Sulli-
van never made the list; Pollack 
did just once, in 2013.

When asked about this dis-

crepancy in an interview last 
month, University spokesman 
Rick Fitzgerald said Hanlon’s 
higher salary stemmed from 
his level of experience — when 
he assumed the provost role in 
2010, he had been a vice provost 
for six years. Pollack had only 
served as vice provost for three 
years.

Fitzgerald added that Han-

lon’s experience as an associate 
dean in LSA also contributed 
critical skills, noting that the 
college alone is larger than some 
universities.

“It was a reflection of what he 

was bringing to that position,” 
Fitzgerald said.

Furthermore, Pollack’s con-

tract when she took the position 
of provost was only for two years 
— comparable to the number of 
years interim executives often 
serve. Fitzgerald said this short-
er-term appointment, combined 
with previous experience that 
was less extensive than Han-
lon’s, could be the reason for her 
lower salary.

Pollack’s 
contract 
was 

renewed through 2018 at the 
University’s Board of Regents 
meeting in December 2014. 
Fitzgerald noted that execu-

tive officers can expect a pay 
increase with reappointment.

“I would expect that Provost 

Pollack … when her reappoint-
ment takes effect, she would 
probably have a pay increase 
along with that extension,” he 
said.

However, not all interims 

receive lower pay. When Suel-
lyn Scarnecchia, a former Uni-
versity general counsel, stepped 
down from the position in 2012, 
for example, the female inter-
im who replaced her received 
a starting salary equivalent to 
Scarnecchia’s.

Pollack’s case is not alone 

in showcasing pay discrepan-
cies. Michael Johns, the interim 
executive vice president of med-
ical affairs, earns 2 percent more 
than Pescovitz did in that role. 
He earns $769,080, while Pesco-
vitz received $753,805.

In reference to this raise, 

Fitzgerald said Johns’ previ-
ous experience as the executive 
vice president for health affairs 
at Emory University made him a 
remarkably qualified interim.

Both Pollack and Hanlon 

were vice provosts for academic 
and budgetary affairs. Pollack 
had three years fewer experi-
ence at this job than Hanlon. 
Prior to that, for three years 
each, Hanlon was an association 
dean for planning and finance at 
LSA, while Pollack was a dean 
at the School of Information. 
Hanlon was a mathematics pro-
fessor before that — a faculty 
member, not administrator. Pol-
lack was an associate chair for 
computer science and engineer-
ing. She directed an engineer-
ing program at the University of 
Pittsburgh prior to joining the 
University’s faculty in 2000.

Before taking the provost 

position, Pollack had 11 years of 
administrative experience, and 
Hanlon had nine years. Present-
ed with this summary, as well 
as the fact that interims do not 
always receive pay decreases, 
Fitzgerald said he had no fur-
ther comment.

How the University decides 

salaries

Both Fitzgerald and Laurita 

Thomas, associate vice presi-
dent for human resources, said 
setting salaries is a complex pro-
cess.

Thomas said University Presi-

dent Mark Schlissel ultimately 
decides salaries for top adminis-
trators, such as the University’s 
vice presidents or the athletic 
director, because they report 
directly to him. The presi-
dent may consult with human 
resources or an outside search 
firm for additional assistance in 
determining salaries, Thomas 
said. She added that the Board 
of Regents determines the presi-
dent’s salary.

Thomas said, overall, sala-

ries are decided by the individ-
ual or body that supervises the 
employee. These decisions are 
influenced by an array of factors.

“The person doing the hiring 

looks at market data, the knowl-
edge the candidate brings and 
their performance data,” Thomas 
said. “The hirer establishes val-
ues, comes up with a fair range 
for a salary with those values and 
the hirer and the candidate nego-
tiate within that range.”

These market rates are a sig-

nificant factor in determining 
pay, Thomas said. Because the 
University competes with other 
collegiate institutions and pri-
vate sector corporations for fac-
ulty and administration, it must 
ensure that its compensation 
package is comparable.

“All executive positions are 

market sensitive,” Thomas said. 
“We depend on how fast the 
market changes. We want top 
leaders in this country, and we 
have to be very market sensitive 
in these roles.”

This means salaries are deter-

mined in a way that retains 
employees and attracts new 
ones. Both goals are meant to 
ensure the University touts 
high-caliber people who do 
high-caliber work.

In the case of a new employee, 

other salary factors include but 
are not limited to the candidate’s 
background and experience, and 
the costs required to bring that 
candidate to the University.

Studies: Gender wage gaps 

exist, even if it’s 

unintentional

Whatever explanations there 

may be for salary discrepancies 
between those who have filled 
the University’s provost position 
in the last nine years, the female 
provosts were paid less than the 
male provost.

At the University, the top 

10 highest base salaries have 
belonged to mostly men since 
2008. In the last seven years, 
men have held 80 percent of the 
top-paid positions — includ-
ing vice president for medical 
affairs, chief financial officer, 
vice president for development 
and dean of the Law School.

Exceptions 
to 
this 
trend 

include President Emerita Cole-
man, whose salary, not includ-
ing bonuses, peaked at $603,357; 
and Ora Pescovitz, who served 
as EVPMA from 2009 to 2014 
and whose ending salary was 
$753,805. (Coleman declined sev-
eral offers for bonuses from the 
regents throughout her tenure.)

Fitzgerald 
re-emphasized 

that salaries are based on indi-
vidual qualifications and the 
responsibilities required of a 
given position. Neither of these 
criteria, he said, favor a certain 
gender.

“If you are looking at the top 

10 positions in any given year 
and what those positions are, it’s 
really more of a function of the 
market for those specific posi-
tions,” Fitzgerald said. “And I 
do not believe that it represents 
or indicates any sort of gender 
bias on the part of the Univer-
sity. I think it’s more of a func-
tion of the people recruited for 
these high level positions, that 
it’s unique to those individuals.”

Nationally, many studies have 

attributed trends in pay gaps to 
the existence of gender-based 
biases in different fields of work. 
Economics Prof. Martha Bailey, a 
research associate for the Nation-
al Bureau of Economic Research, 
has extensively studied labor eco-
nomics and gender wage gaps. 
She said research affirms the 
existence of wage discrimination 
based on gender.

“I don’t think there’s any short-

age of evidence that there’s gen-
der discrimination in the world,” 
she said.

Hard numbers confirm that 

female job applicants to jobs tend 
to be offered lower salaries than 
their male equivalents.

In 2012, the scientific jour-

nal Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences published 
a report that found female appli-
cants for lab manager positions at 
Yale University were given lower 
ratings and offered lower salaries 
than their male equivalents.

A similar study out of Skid-

more College in 2014 found that 
women in faculty positions at 
the college for STEM fields were 
seen as less competent and given 
lower salaries than their male 
counterparts.

“I would not be surprised at 

all if there’s a difference in sal-
ary between men and women 
at the University, even after 
accounting for rank and years 
of experience and publication 
record and a variety of other 
types of things,” Bailey said.

Is the provost example 

universal?

Though anomalies do exist 

when comparing female and 

male salaries among University 
executives, compiled data of 40 
executive position salaries from 
2002 to 2015 indicates that there 
is not a statistical difference in 
pay between men and women at 
the University in the same posi-
tion.

The data was compiled using 

the salaries of all University 
vice president positions, deans, 
UMHS leaders, directors and 
assistant vice provosts. Origi-
nally, nearly 60 positions were 
compiled. However, some were 
ruled out either because they 
had changed too much to be 
comparable through a decade 
period or because they had been 
created during that period.

According to regression anal-

ysis — conducted by LSA senior 
Jacob Light, who is majoring in 
math and economics, and vetted 
by Bailey, the labor economist 
and economics professor — aver-
age salaries and gender do not 
have a strong relationship. In 
other words, gender is not a reli-
able factor in predicting salary 
changes at the University.

While women have received 

fewer significant increases than 
men, Light found, the data does 
not suggest that women are less 
likely to receive larger boosts 
in pay than their male counter-
parts.

The data was controlled for 

gender, position, years with the 
title, inflation and the status of 
the incumbent — if they were 
an interim or first-year candi-
date. Analyses focused on per-
cent changes from year to year 
in each position, overall percent 
change in the position base pay 
and the genders of each execu-
tive in each position.

Comparing with 

competitors

A University slide provided 

by Fitzgerald outlines the 10 top 
schools with which the Univer-
sity competes for faculty: Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley; 
University of California, Los 
Angeles; University of North 
Carolina – Chapel Hill; Universi-
ty of Texas at Austin; University 
of Chicago; Harvard University; 
Stanford University; University 
of Pennsylvania; Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology; and 
Columbia University.

The Daily included The Uni-

versity of Virginia, another peer 
public institution, in the analy-
sis to increase sample size.

Calculations show that the 

average 
disparity 
between 

female and male salaries at these 
11 top colleges and the Univer-
sity shows that women earn 
96 cents for every dollar a man 
makes — 3.4 percent less. Fur-
thermore, these top universities 
fill their most prominent posi-
tions with mostly men. Analysis 
revealed that 37 percent of exec-
utive employees were female. 
Sixty-three percent were men.

These calculations are based 

on two data sets: the 2013 list of 
salaries reported on the public 
colleges’ respective state data-
bases, and the 2011 list of private 
school salaries reported in the 
Chronicle of Higher Education, 
the only year for which data was 
available. Private schools are not 
required to disclose their salary 
database to taxpayers, whereas 
public schools are.

However, to provide full dis-

closure, salary figures were not 
available for every position at 
every school, either because cer-
tain positions, such as vice presi-
dent for student life, do not exist 
at every school or because fig-
ures were simply not included in 
available salary disclosures.

On average, salaries at the 

University were 4 percent higher 
than those of their counterpart 
institutions. However, a gender 
breakdown revealed a contrast: 
While male University employ-
ees earned an average of 8 per-

cent more than their competitors 
at other schools, female employ-
ees earned 1 percent more.

More discrepancies appear 

in a comparison of average male 
and female executive position 
salaries.

Women serving as deans for 

these universities’ LSA equiva-
lents earned 31 percent less than 
their male counterparts; while 
the men earned an average of 
$426,000, the women earned 
an average of $295,000. In a 
10-year span, this means a man 
would earn more than $1 million 
more than his female equivalent.

Female vice presidents for 

development earned 19 per-
cent less than men, and women 
in medical dean roles earned 
12.3 percent less than males. 
Double-digit discrepancies also 
existed for the positions of exec-
utive vice presidents for medi-
cal affairs and vice president of 
development.

There was not a single execu-

tive position with fewer than 
three men total out of the 12 sur-
veyed colleges. Perhaps the most 
glaring example was in 2013, 
when each of the 12 colleges had 
a male provost.

Presidential salaries seem to 

be higher for women. Exclud-
ing University of Pennsylvania 
President Amy Gutmann, whose 
total compensation is over $2 
million, female presidential sal-
aries were $628,638 on average, 
whereas men earned $677,000. 
Gutmann’s salary is the high-
est of the sampled institutions 
and comparatively high even 
among peer institutions in the 
Ivy League.

Otherwise, in only two posi-

tions does a female majority 
exist — vice president for stu-
dent life and human resources 
director.

A few positions reflect a 

female pay advantage. Women 
serving as general counsels 
appear to earn more than men, 
averaging $450,000 in compari-
son to the male $380,000. This 
statistic may also be skewed — 
on average, public schools pay 
their general counsels 30.4 per-
cent less than do private schools. 
Six of the total 12 surveyed insti-
tutions are public and in this 
sample, each public institution 
except the University had a male 
incumbent.

Female vice presidents for 

student life at public institutions 
earn about 11 percent more than 
their male counterparts. Two 
men compared to four women 
held that title. Only public insti-
tutions were considered, since 
only two out of six private insti-
tutions considered in this study 
employed vice presidents for 
student life.

In 
summary, 
across 
the 

University and its 11 competi-
tor institutions, statistics are 
clearly weighted in favor of male 
executives, both in terms of pure 
quantity and average salary. 
Even in cases where it appears 
that women have the upper hand 
as far as average salary, those 
positions don’t seem to repre-
sent the whole picture.

Conclusion

Cumulative data from 2002 to 

2015 shows there is not a statis-
tical difference in pay between 
men and women at the Univer-
sity in the same executive posi-
tions.

However, data across numer-

ous institutions of higher educa-
tion indicates that men tend to 
earn more than do women, and 
men tend to fill executive posi-
tions more than do women.

Additionally, 
because 
men 

have held 80 percent of the Uni-
versity’s top-paid positions since 
2008, it is quite possible that the 
problem is not receiving ade-
quate pay when holding a posi-
tion, but acquiring a high-paying 
position to begin with.

proposal that aims to create an 
additional “spirit song” for use 
at University athletics events — 
resurfaced Tuesday night.

The “Hail and Unite” project 

was initially introduced with 
a resolution requesting $2,750 
in funding to support a promo-
tional video, recruit donations 
and provide accommodations 
for potential visiting contribu-
tors.

This resolution was later 

pulled after “Hail and Unite” 
stirred debate over the future 
of the University’s fight song, 
“The Victors.”

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily last week, LSA 
senior Mike Weinberg, the 
project’s founder, emphasized 
the song was not intended to 
replace the fight song.

The revised proposal asks 

CSG to endorse the song rather 
than fund it.

On Tuesday, Weinberg said 

the project no longer needed 
money from CSG for promo-
tional materials because recent 
media attention generated a 
great deal of publicity.

CSG representative Andrew 

Loeb, an LSA senior, ques-
tioned whether or not the song 
would benefit the communi-
ty, given the mixed response 
among students and alumni.

“We’ve found thus far that 

the biggest problem is lack 
of information, ” Weinberg 
said. “So far, whenever we’ve 
pitched or talked to people, 
they love the idea.”

The legislation was referred 

to the resolutions committee 
and will most likely be voted on 
during the next CSG meeting.

Course evaluations

A second resolution pro-

posed during Tuesday’s meet-
ing asked the assembly to 
support the release of course 
evaluation ratings for profes-
sors and Graduate Student 
Instructors.

The legislation was com-

posed by CSG president Bobby 
Dishell, a Public Policy senior; 

CSG 
vice 
president 
Emily 

Lustig, an LSA senior, and rep-
resentative Steven Halperin, 
an LSA sophomore.

The resolution supports an 

action request that will even-
tually go in front of the Sen-
ate Advisory Committee on 
University 
Affairs, 
asking 

SACUA 
to 
distribute 
sum-

maries of numerical scores 
and response rates for the fol-
lowing questions: “1. Overall, 
this was an excellent course; 2. 
Overall, the instructor was an 
excellent teacher; 3. I learned a 
great deal from this course; 4. I 
had a strong desire to take this 
course.”

The authors of the legislation 

felt it would be useful for stu-

dents to see the feedback when 
choosing 
classes 
for 
future 

semesters.

“We think this will help 

us get away from more biased 
websites 
like 
ratemyprofes-

sors.com 
and 
myedu.com,” 

Lustig said.

Representatives 
had 
ques-

tions about whether the initia-
tive could increase the student 
response rate to the course eval-
uations. Lustig said this was a 
factor that could potentially be 
mentioned in the final resolu-
tion.

The legislation was referred 

to the resolutions committee and 
will be voted on during the next 
CSG meeting.

(D–Ward 4), who voted against 
the adoption, said the analysis 
asks more from the city than sim-
ply buttressing affordable hous-
ing. He said the issue should be 
addressed by the county govern-
ment, not the city.

“While 
I 
support 
funding 

affordable housing in Ann Arbor, 
I don’t believe that we should be 
trying to get wealthy young pro-
fessionals to move to Ypsilanti 
and getting people who can afford 
housing in Ypsilanti to move to 
Ann Arbor to change our demo-
graphics. It is ill conceived.”

ect at a time you would get more 
into it because you know you are 
attached to it long-term,” Peterson 
said. “There is more of a commit-
ment there.”

The program will work in tan-

dem with the Undergraduate 
Research Opportunity Program, 
with UROP students working on 
VIP teams and eligible to receive 
credits or a stipend for their 
research. 
Non-UROP 
students 

will receive credit hours.

Hohner said students can apply 

for the VIP program during the 
MDP 
recruitment 
process 
in 

October.

Peterson said she hopes the 

initiative will help students feel 
a sense of ownership over their 
research projects and provide 
an opportunity to take on more 
responsibility.

“If the University took into 

account that kind of connection 
between the lab workers and the 
project itself, it would improve 
my vision of what research here 
entails.”

ccording to a study conducted by The Ann Arbor News, the 
University’s non-resident freshman enrollment has increased 
11.3 percent while resident freshmen enrollment has decreased 

by 8.3 percent since 2010. Similarly, students from California and New 
York make up roughly 5.6 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of the 
undergraduate and graduate populations combined. Illinois is not far 
behind at 4.5 percent of the total student population. The majority of 
international students come from China and India, combining to make 
up 7.7 percent of students. Several in-state residents have expressed 
concern that the increase in out-of-state application acceptances will 
leave Michigan students behind. However, many of the theories about 
out-of-state students seem to be exaggerated myths.

I

t’s another Sunday night in Ann 
Arbor so cold it gives a body the 
flesh-creep.

The hairs in my 

nostrils have been 
replaced 
with 

broken shards of 
stained glass from 
Satan’s cathedral.

I stumble down 

into my low-light 
winter basement.

I dislodge the 

icicle buried in my 
skull.

I peel off my 

frozen, crusty eyelids.

I wring the wind chill out of my 

coat.

I try to resist the temptation to ask 

my iPhone what it feels like outside. 
(Because we already know: it feels 
really fucking awful.)

I think of a warmer place.
I think of home.
I think of sunny, stupid Florida.
And then I realize: I have become 

my own worst enemy.

Home isn’t home anymore, it’s a 

destination. I’m not a local. I’m just 
like everyone else: a slow-moving 
target with Michigan plates, looking 
for a good place to wear my socks on 
the beach.

I have become a snowbird.
I am the ruby-crowned kinglet, 

except I’m enrolled in 18 credits. 
When the rest of the snowbirds chirp 

their ways south, I’m here, studying 
for finals.

But don’t worry, I’ll catch up with 

the rest!

I just have to spend a little more 

time working through exhaustion 
in a fluorescent studio or library. 
Cramming, 
cramming. 
Waiting 

until a paper’s morning deadline 
has its white, xeroxy hand around 
my throat. The word count ticks up 
along with my feelings of self-doubt 
and fraudulence. I’m groping toward 
a thesis, but in its absence I hope I 
will be redeemed by innovation with 
adjectives and my ability to make a 
summary sound like analysis.

I don’t want to be here.
I can think only of the ruby-

crowned kinglet. He’s free of these 
human distractions, this oppressive 
arctic air.

What do you think the ruby-

crowned kinglet is doing right now? 
He’s strutting his stuff for all the 
other pretty little birdies in the 
 

J. N. “Ding” Darling National Wild-
life Refuge. He’s probably getting 
laid in broad daylight. Some kind 
aunt from Toledo looks on reverently. 
She decides that, after all, the $6 toll 
for the Sanibel Causeway was worth 
it. “That ruby-crowned kinglet has 
game. They don’t do it like that back 
in Ohio,” she says (ever-so-quietly so 
as not to disturb the great blue heron 
to her left).

And I am here. Drinking very sorry 

brown water from an on-campus cof-
fee shop. I have been laid low by the 
analysis of biblical themes in the film 
“The Road” adapted from Cormac 
McCarthy’s novel of the same name. 
I come up with two thousand words 
about the color gray.

I wouldn’t mind getting on the 

Road myself right now. I’ll take my 
chances with the cannibals.

Anything to be warm. Anything to 

spread my wings.

Anything to make that aunt from 

Toledo blush.

But the cold draft dripping down 

my back from a bad window brings 
another realization.

I have become a snowbird in 

reverse. I’m the worst, most busted 
snowbird you could imagine.

I don’t spend all my spring breaks 

in Florida. The big stretch of time I 
get to be home is the summer.

I am not the ruby-crowned king-

let. I don’t leave for the winter.

I haven’t learned my lesson yet. I 

stay!

I am still the same brown pelican 

I have always been. Except now it’s 
perpetually February and I’m sitting 
on the bank of the Huron River hold-
ing a margarita in my mittened hand 
wondering, on repeat — muttering to 
myself:

What for? What for? What for?

The weather

The general concern about the increase in 

out-of-state students is that the tax dollars 
Michigan residents have been paying to the 
University for years, by way of state taxes, 
have been wasted due to the decrease of in-
state students. However, state funding to the 
University has not been consistent throughout 
the past decade. University Provost Martha 
Pollack expressed the University’s struggle 
with state divestment from higher education, 
explaining that the state’s per-student fund-
ing is 60 percent of what it was just 10 years 
ago. Though, in 2013, Pollack said the increase 
was due to a dwindling state population, rath-
er than a need for more financial resources. 
Taking a closer look at the school’s budget, we 
see that $295 million per year comes from the 
state. This is a large number, but not necessar-
ily a large portion of what goes into running 
such a renowned and large university. Fifty-
five years ago, state support accounted for 78 
percent of the University’s general funding. 
With such a drastic decrease in support to the 
University’s General Fund — which pays for 
teaching, service and administrative support 
costs — by the state, it’s understandable that 
the University would accept more out-of-state 
students, who pay tuition rates nearly triple 
that of in-state students.

The University’s attempt to combat the dis-

crepancy with state funding speaks for itself. 
When one looks at the $178 million it invests 
toward financial aid for in-state undergradu-
ates and $147.5 million for out-of-staters, it’s 
easy to see the University’s focus. Given the 
discrepancy in the number of in-state students, 
of which there are 11,666 undergraduates, ver-
sus the 5,698 out-of-stater undergraduates, 
the scales are weighted heavily on the side of 
in-state residents. Additionally, the revenue 
generated by the noticeable difference between 
in-state and out-of-state tuition students is vast. 
More specifically, in 2014, out-of-state students 
paid a $41,578 per-year bill with a 3.4 percent 
tuition increase compared to an in-state cost 

of $13,158 and a 1.6 percent increase. This will 
result in $150 million more in funds coming 
from out-of-state residents, despite out-of-state 
undergraduates being significantly outnum-
bered in the overall student population. The 
University seems to be doing its best to look out 
for the costs of its in-state residents.

The real issue in funding stems from more 

systemic issues in the state’s legislature and 
its monetary support to schools. The problem 
isn’t the increasing desire for out-of-state resi-
dents to attend such a great school, but rather 
where the state of Michigan chooses to allocate 
its resources — more specifically, the state’s 
investment of an unprecedented $1 billion a 
year toward in-state charter schools. Char-
ter schools take needed attention away from a 
focus on public high schools in Michigan. State 
graduation rates peaked in 2008 (also unprec-
edented by any other state) and have been drop-
ping since, though they did improve slightly 
last year. Funding charter schools takes money 
from the state and gives it to privately run insti-
tutions that have been described by The Detroit 
Free Press as having a lack of transparency 
with their spending habits. This begs the ques-
tion: why is all of this state money going toward 
privately run institutions instead of our public 
schools? The idea seems to benefit a select few 
in-state residents while leaving out those most 
subject to the public school system.

If the state keeps treating the University 

as if it’s a private school, then it will have 
to change its business practices in order to 
remain the competitive institution where 
parents want to send their kids. Out-of-state 
students bring diversity to the student popu-
lation, they bring money that lightens the 
load for in-state students and apparently for 
the state government, which is now choosing 
to send more of its funds elsewhere. While 
increasing out-of-state enrollment may seem 
controversial, in reality, it is one of the few 
options the University has to keep its budget 
balanced and remain a top-tier institution.

“Life.” This is my tired answer to the 

question of what I am studying, the first 
question people ask of me, the question that 
has apparently become the new version of the 
90s pick-up line, “Hey baby, what’s your sign?”

I answer wearily because I am undecided; 

I have apparently lost my enthusiasm for 
creativity, and kind of want to answer that I’m 
a Gemini. I used to answer that I wanted to 
learn to breed rare birds or do research on how 
singing affects plant growth, but humor lost 
its appeal during my first week in Ann Arbor.

Every other person, it seemed, wanted to 

be a doctor or engineer or at least had a slight 
direction. I still don’t. Being undecided means 
being unique, I read online. For me, it means 
I can turn any conversation into an awkward 
halt with my quasi-answer of “the question.”

I used to think I needed to print a list of LSA 

majors and use the lines of a blue pen to pick 
by process of elimination (so far, I know I will 
not be a computer scientist nor a student of 
the German language). This is not an entirely 
bad idea, but decisions need to have the right 
motivation behind them. The decision of what 
to do with your life shouldn’t be chosen by 
forced self-pressure.

National statistics, though inconclusive, 

say that around 20 to 50 percent of freshmen 
enter college undecided about their major, so 
the pressure I feel is totally self-made. But I am 
still nervous.

Statistics also say that many change 

their majors at least three times before they 
graduate. I’m still not feeling great, because 
this is the University of Michigan. Surely 
general statistics don’t apply to us, right? But 
maybe they do.

My favorite reassurance about being 

undecided is that many of the future 
jobs have not even been created, yet this 
seemingly helpful point really stresses me out. 
Uncertainty always does. I don’t know how to 

prepare for something that doesn’t exist yet.

I’ve heard people say that students in 

college without a specific goal tend to do 
worse in school. However, we, the undecided, 
do have a goal: to figure out a specific goal! 
We are racing against time and distributions 
and the limits of our confidence. So are we not 
 

more impressive?

Without a doubt, there are some perks 

of being undecided. Because of the many 
distribution credits the University demands of 
us, we get to explore. Like mothers everywhere 
say, how do you know you don’t like something 
if you have never tried it?

By introducing yourself to many fields early 

on, you can conduct the process of elimination 
with some experience under your belt. Many 
people do not figure out who they are until 
college — you shouldn’t have to predict what 
future you will enjoy without experiencing 
it first.

I understand; I’m not helping. But I have 

observed and questioned this phenomenon of 
treating the undecided like pariahs. Though 
I have come to terms with the awesome 
expedition that is being undecided, I have 
looked into a few tips that might help those 
with less confidence come to terms with what 
they are.

Explore different kinds of classes (spending 

all of your time in the Chemistry building isn’t 
healthy). Try out the Career Center (it probably 
exists for a good reason). Talk to people, but 
do not feel compelled to listen. Just because 
a friend says that professor was a hippie (and 
makes it sound like that is a bad thing) or that 
writers cannot find jobs or your mother is afraid 
that if you go to Africa you will get Ebola, that 
does not mean you are obliged to listen.

There is one thing everyone should be able 

to agree on about us undecided — we are brave.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

When you’re a part of the Michi-

gan community, you’re part of a 
team. Like any team, we care for 
and listen to our peers’ thoughts and 
concerns. We inspire and motivate 
those around us, and they recipro-
cate this encouragement. We always 
have each other’s backs. But most 
of all, we always collectively strive 
to find new and innovative ways to 
improve our campus.

Central Student Government was 

created to serve as the platform for 
students to voice concerns, com-
plaints and ideas about how to better 
the Michigan experience. However, 
year after year, communities on 
campus feel that their voices are not 
being heard, and most have turned to 
other means to develop their ideas. 
The Team was created to change 
this. CSG should embrace every voice 
and perspective on campus and pro-
vide the resources they need to turn 
their ideas into realities.

The Team draws its strength 

from our diverse group of student 
leaders who each represent differ-
ent communities and are passion-
ate about particular campus issues. 
Our main objective is to give all of 
these communities and individu-
als a chance to discuss these issues 
with one another and to unify these 
viewpoints into a single vision for 
our campus community.

The Team is running LSA junior 

Will Royster for President and LSA 
sophomore Matt Fidel for Vice 
President of the University’s Cen-
tral Student Government. Will and 
Matt exemplify what it means to 
be a student leader on this campus 
and share our emphasis on inclu-
sivity and collaboration. They are 
both leaders that don’t pretend to 
have all of the answers. Rather, 
they know their strengths as lead-
ers and leverage those to work on 
the issues they are individually pas-
sionate about. When they do deal 
with issues on campus that they 
have less experience with, they seek 
the guidance and advice of other 
equally enthusiastic student leaders 
who have fervently advocated for 
those issues throughout their col-

lege careers. They actively listen to 
these individuals and will use CSG’s 
broad resources and connections to 
empower them to bring their visions 
to fruition. Will and Matt assist in 
uplifting student voices, recognizing 
that in their place of power they can 
be the agents to facilitate communica-
tion and change between the students 
and administrators.

The Team will prioritize our cam-

pus, our community, our commit-
ment in order to make it your CSG.

Our Campus: There are many 

different tangible issues CSG can 
work on to improve the day-to-day 
experience for students on this 
campus. Athletics and its traditions 
unify the student body, and we are 
dedicated to working with the new 
Athletic Director to expand the 
Maize Rage and to further promote 
non-revenue generating sports. As 
part of a team, we must support all 
of our student-athletes. Moreover, 
many students who are not part of 
a specific sub-school do not have 
access to many career services. At 
a University with one of the world’s 
largest alumni networks, we want 
to work with the Career Center to 
create an all-inclusive alumni men-
torship program. This program will 
match students with alumni based 
on their interest area, major and 
gender. They can assist in navigat-
ing campus life as well as the post-
graduation job market and beyond.

Our Community: CSG has the 

potential to drive meaningful social 
change on campus. Will is cur-
rently working with the Black Stu-
dent Union to start a new initiative 
called the Michigan Institute for the 
Improvement of African American 
Representation. MIIAAR is work-
ing to bring 30 to 40 ninth and tenth 
grade African American students 
to Michigan and assist in the pro-
gram, increasing and understanding 
more about minority enrollment. 
The Team will expand this pro-
gram to more high-school students 
from underrepresented communi-
ties and help facilitate their transi-
tion to Michigan. In addition, The 
Team will immediately ally with 

other organizations to tackle sexual 
assault on our campus. Currently, 
faculty members at the University 
do not have to participate in any 
formal sexual assault prevention 
training. We want to work with the 
administration to ensure that every 
faculty member at the University 
is receiving comprehensive sexual 
assault prevention training as well 
as empower ongoing initiatives to 
prevent sexual assault.

Our Commitment: The Team is 

dedicated to ensuring every student 
voice is heard. In order to achieve 
this objective, we will start a new 
CSG text-message hotline. If you 
have any complaints or just want 
to voice your opinion, you will be 
able to text a number and receive 
a response directly from Will, 
Matt or a member of the CSG staff 
addressing your concerns. Fur-
thermore, we will revamp the cur-
rent UPetition system, allowing for 
further explanation and comments 
for students to express the reasons 
for signing the petition. In addi-
tion, after a certain number of sig-
natures, we will mandate that Will 
and Matt provide a response to the 
petition. An evolving dialogue will 
help us adjust our priorities based 
on the campus climate.

Each of these separate pillars con-

tributes to our singular vision for 
CSG: making your CSG an effective, 
collaborative and inclusive organi-
zation. Our name speaks to the idea 
that CSG works best when we are 
supporting and empowering one 
another.

“Do you ever feel / Like a plastic bag / In a French performance art troupe.”
Balloons come alive in 
‘Afternoon of a Foehn’

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writer

We’re warned: Don’t leave 

the theater for the 25-minute 
duration of the performance, 
as any disturbance in the air 
can 
be 
problematic. 
There’s 

no re-entry anyway. We walk 
into the Experimental Theater 
of Skyline High School, being 
the youngest people who aren’t 
children and the oldest people 
without children. Inside, a man in 
a beanie and a long navy peacoat 
methodically cuts away from a 
pink plastic bag with limbs and 
a head in the center of a circle of 
fans. Jean-Louis Ouvrard, the 
performance-operator, sets the 
fans and assumes his position at 
the controls at the rear. A flute’s 
chromatic sequence, soon joined 
by an arpeggiating harp and 
saturated chords by the basses, 
heralds the beginning of the 
cutest thing you’ve ever seen: 
dancing balloons.

Commissioned by the Natu-

ral History Museum of Nantes in 
2008 for their annual Fête des Sci-
ences and designed by French the-
atrical performer Phia Ménard, 
Compagnie Non Nova’s show Pre-
lude to the Afternoon of a Foehn is a 
charming marvel of design. Their 
name, Compagnie Non Nova, is 
an abbreviation of “Non nova, 
sed nove,” Latin for “Not new 
things, but in a new way.” What 
UMS describes as their “multidis-
ciplinarity” is a result of the col-
laboration of professional artists 
from many different backgrounds 
and traditions. Exploration of 
“the abstract ideas of matter and 
transformation” unites the art-

ists of Compagnie Non Nova and 
underlies the beautiful playful-
ness of this show.

The narrative arc of the show 

is fairly simple. At first, only one 
plastic bag performs its delicate, 
adorable twists and spins. Soon, 
other recycled buddies join the 
spectacle. 
Ouvrard 
skillfully 

manipulates the wind to make 
the ensemble dance together, but 
his involvement doesn’t end at 
assembly. Here, he gets up and 
dances with the balloons. But 
the more balloons he adds to the 
mix, the more responsibility he 
has and the more overwhelmed 
he becomes as he strains to man-
age his creations. To reflect this 
change in mood, the music grows 
more somber. As Debussy gives 
way to suspenseful, brooding, 
minimal music, Ouvrard’s con-
tentment and delight with his cre-
ations devolves into anxiety and 
embattlement, erupting finally in 
a massacre of the balloons. Ouv-
rard rips them to shreds, first with 
scissors, then his hands, resorting 
at last to his teeth. While most of 
the audience clapped, many of the 
children in attendance grimaced 
at the destruction. Prelude to the 
Afternoon of a Foehn (“a pun that 
refers to a mountain wind,” the 
UMS site details) is the story of a 
creator-turned-destroyer, 
over-

come by his innocent creations.

Compagnie Non Nova’s work 

made and kept the promise of a 
delightful, fun show that was truly 
suited for all-ages audience. The 
cuteness and innocence played just 
as great a part as the sheer tech-
nical prowess and design. But it 
was something else to come away 
with the in-your-faceness of the 

show’s violence. The performance 
was billed as a children’s show 
through-and-through. The press 
only alluded to the fun and gim-
mick of the floating performers, 
and even the decision to include 
Ouvrard’s assembly of the balloons 
cemented the shows self-aware-
ness as something akin to art-and-
crafts. So for Ouvrard to destroy 
the balloons felt like a statement 
something along the lines of: If 
you’re not willing to teach and 
remind your kids that violence 
exists alongside fun in the world, 
then we are.

Working on all of these levels at 

once, Compagnie Non Nova’s Pre-
lude to the Afternoon of a Foehn is 
a mature, playful and thoughtful 
show that exhibits the professional 
acumen and incredible creativity 
of Ménard, Ouvrard and the other 
members of the Nantes-based 
company.

There will be shows this Thurs-

day, Friday and Saturday. Tickets 
and times are available at the UMS 
page for the performance.

A note on reduced ticket pricing 

for students from the UMS website: 
“UMS will set aside a limited quan-
tity of student tickets in select seat-
ing areas at half-price. Purchase

Reunion episode 
filled with hours of 
hit-and-miss content

By MATTHEW BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

With 40 years of “Saturday 

Night Live,” it’s a note of irony that 
its legacy was cele-
brated on a Sunday. 
It boasted a three-
and-a-half-hour 
extravaganza 
to 

mark the feat with 
a guest list so long 
it rivals “Too Many 
Cooks”in length. If 
anything, the 40th 
Anniversary Spe-
cial was indicative 
of “SNL” ’s legacy: 
it had some great 
moments, most of it was OK and 
some parts fell flat. At this point, 
“SNL” is an institution. There are 
moments where it won’t be strong, 
but it will always be there, trying 
its hardest to bring laughs.

The special was heavily front-

loaded trying to get as many big 
names out as quickly as possible. 
Naturally, Jimmy Fallon and Jus-
tin Timberlake continued their 
bromance to end all bromances by 
opening the show. The duo’s rap of 
iconic one-liners reflects just how 
much “SNL” has influenced pop 
culture.

Steve Martin’s opening mono-

logue brought forth the divisive 
question, “Who makes the best 
guests on the show?” Is it come-
dians, actors, musicians, athletes 
or musicians named Paul? As the 
special played out with a favored 
bias toward comedians, they 
dominated the monologue and 
segue sequences. 

The live sketches had several 

early highlights, with Celebrity 
Jeopardy growing more and more 
absurd as celebrity imperson-
ations crowded the stage, includ-
ing the iconic Burt Reynolds/
Turd Ferguson by Norm Mac-
Donald and Darrell Hammond’s 
Sean Connery, who misreads 
“Who Reads?” as “Whore Ads.”

Weekend Update showcased 

the power of women on “SNL” 
with its dream lineup of Amy 
Poehler, Tina Fey and Jane Curtin 
anchoring the update desk. Of all 
the jokes, Poehler’s comment on 

the special itself — “that won an 
Emmy in the first 10 minutes and 
then lost it somewhere in the mid-
dle” — was the most pointed in 
self-criticism. The special revered 
the establishment of “SNL,” but 
never denied that there are weak-
nesses in the show’s historic run.

Predictably so, there were 

weak moments in the lengthy 
show. The special fired its most 
powerful ammunition early and 
at times struggled to maintain its 
earlier rapid-fire pacing. Chris 
Rock wasted his heartfelt appre-
ciation for Eddie Murphy as he 
came out to say, “I liked being 
here,” with no real punchline. 
Murphy’s presence on the show in 
the early ’80s kept SNL afloat and 
featured a bevy of hilarious char-
acters, but there was no Gumby, 
Mr. Robinson or surprise resur-
rection of Buckwheat to be seen. 
The same goes for Chevy Chase, 
who was saved by the presence of 
Garrett Morris in the persona of a 
“News for the Hard of Hearing” 
translator.

The tribute montages appeared 

too densely near the middle, but 
several cornerstones of “SNL” ’s 
identity stood out. The behind-
the-scenes audition tapes dis-
played the beginnings of classic 
sketches as cast members audi-
tioned for the first time. They 
also gave an opportunity to show 
future icons that didn’t make the 
show like Stephen Colbert, Jim 
Carrey and a beardless Zach Gali-
fianakis. New York’s presence in 
the show’s history was highlight-
ed, bringing back the post-9/11 

episode where Lorne Michaels 
asked Mayor Rudy Giuliani, “Can 
we be funny?” to which Giuliani 
earnestly replied, “Why start 
now?” 

Whenever the special seemed 

to be running out of gas, there 
was always someone to kick-
start it. Martin Short and Maya 
Rudolph (in character as Beyon-
cé) energetically usurped almost 
every musical character or skit 
from the show’s history. Later, 
Jerry Seinfeld had a fantastically 
awkward reunion with “Sein-
feld” co-creator Larry David. 
The comeback of Digital Shorts, 
led by Andy Samberg and Adam 
Sandler, brought a musical trib-
ute to breaking character during 
a sketch (mainly at the expense of 
Fallon and Horatio Sanz).

The 
musical 
guests 
varied 

eclectically. Paul McCartney was 
an obvious choice, but the inclu-
sion of Miley Cyrus and Kanye 
West raised eyebrows. Although 
the two may not be indicative of 
“SNL” ’s history, they both put 
together memorable performanc-
es with Cyrus’s tribute to Paul 
Simon and West’s avant-garde 
talents (and some self-deprecation 
in the Wayne’s World sketch). But 
most fittingly, Paul Simon himself 
closed with “Still Crazy After All 
These Years.” 

Yes, after all these years, “SNL” 

is still here. There will moments 
where it’s lacking, but in the end 
there will always be that special 
moment to remember the show by. 
So, “Goodnight and have a pleas-
ant tomorrow.”

Ovadia & Sons has never raised 

my eyebrow, be it from shock or 
disgust or inspiration. However, 
the NYC-based sportswear house 
seldom does things the wrong way 
— from their crisp shirting and fine 
tailoring to toying with retro fabric 
patterns. Their spring 2015 collec-
tion flirted with familiar concepts 
without overindulging, refusing 
to get sucked into the make-your-
eyes-hurt sandstorm of colors and 
loudness that often haunts luxury 
brands when this week rears its 
head.

The most distinctive element 

we saw was the so-regal hound-
stooth option (think if herring-
bone and gingham did each other) 
on signature overcoats and sports 
jackets, in classic black and white, 
dovetailing with black underneath 
and at the feet. It takes a muted 
look and lends it a whisper, just 
loud enough to piss off the Law 
students. The houndstooth didn’t 
cease — it reappeared on a black-
sleeved bomber over a drape-y, 
tail-less white button-down. Scott 
Sternberg over at Band of Outsid-
ers is just one proponent of the 
dress shirt without the “dress,” 
eschewing gussets and tails for an 
even hem around the entire waist. 
In addition, eyes peeled for more 
of this streetwear-inspired drap-
ing — no longer does one need his 

jacket to obscure the underneath 
shirting. Let it hang, and low.

Dominated 
by 
dichromatic 

pieces, the show is not set up to 
fail like, say, a Versace show in 
which … nevermind. In other 
words, O&S tends to lean con-
servative, yet their offerings are 
invariably on-trend with play-
ful blends. A half-shine hoodie 
lets its hood kneel on the lapels 
of yet another houndstooth: this 

a time navy-black suit. Because 
O&S is first and foremost a sports-
wear label, they love bridging 
the gap between sport and city. 
The show wraps up with throw-
back patterns (’50s windowpane, 
sharkskin, plaid) and almond 
shearling-like coats, proving, at 
once, that they know what they’ve 
liked in the past and are poised to 
reintroduce it — without being too 
annoying about it.

Daily Arts Writer

On the opening night of Chek-

ov’s “The Seagull” in 1896, the 
playwright left the theater at the 
end of the night 
having 
vowed 

never to write a 
play again. It was 
a positive flop. The 
actress who played 
one of the main 
characters, 
Nina, 

had lost her voice, 
resulting 
in 
an 

awkward delivery 
that drove Chekov 
to hide behind the 
stage for the sec-
ond half of the play.

Still, the bril-

liance of the story 
shone through for 
some. 
Chekov’s 

peer and fellow 
playwright, Vladimir Nemirovich-
Danchenko, convinced him into 

having the Seagull performed at 
the Moscow Theater, which had 
only just opened in 1898. The play 
was a triumphant success, mark-
ing its path through history from 
that point on.

In 2013, contemporary play-

wright Aaron Posner premiered 
his “sort-of adaptation” of “The 
Seagull,” “Stupid F###ing Bird,” 
and the play was no flop; it was an 
instant hit, so much so that it has 
made its way into this year’s pro-
gram for the Department of The-
ater and Drama.

The play explores themes of 

unrequited love, misdirected pas-
sion, romance, self-love and the 
power of art. “The Seagull,” and 
“Stupid F###ing Bird,” are differ-
ent from other love stories.

In “The Seagull,” the main 

character, Constantine, is a play-
wright searching for affirma-
tion and relevance. His mother, a 
famous actress, overshadows him 
while his father is absent. His girl-
friend, Nina, is drifting from him.

“Both plays associate roman-

tic ambition or any other kind of 
ambition as stemming from the 
same source. And that source is 
longing for relevance, relevance 
that is only affirmed in the eyes 
of the other, the audience, critics, 
or any one who you project your 
love on to,” said Daniel Cantor, the 
director of “Stupid F###ing Bird.” 
This is a profoundly familiar feel-
ing for any 20-something-year-old 
searching to define their future.

The play has many layers. The 

story parallels that of the Seagull, 
with a young playwright longing 
for love and acceptance. There is 
also the play within the play, the 
one that Conrad is writing. This 
prompts many meta moments in 
which the characters address the 
audience directly regarding the 
topic of forms of theater: What 
works and what doesn’t?

“There’s a weird irony in doing 

that,” Cantor said. “You think, well 
this is further from reality now so 
it must be less honest, but in fact 
the meta-theater makes the play 
more honest, because the reality is, 
that we are doing a play! It accepts 
and acknowledges the core experi-
ence, which is human beings com-
ing to a building to watch other 
human beings perform a play.”

The most important layer to the 

play, however, is its encompassing 
relationship with Chekov himself. 
As a genius in storytelling, all other 
artists are, in a way, overshadowed 
by Chekov. This parallels the rela-
tionship between Constantine or 
Conrad and his mother.

“In 
switching 
around 
the 

form of Chekov, Posner is almost 
thumbing his nose, and at the same 
time writing him a love letter. ‘Stu-
pid F###ing Bird’ then, is a giant 
expression, a similar expression, 
to what Constantine does in the 
Seagull,” said Cantor.

In this way, the play represents 

the best of what Chekov can be, 
according to Posner.

“American audiences tend to 

think of Posner as dull, droll, and 
sort of drawer and he’s not. He’s 
energized; it’s fun, it’s funny, 
passionate, contradictory,” Can-
tor said, “ ‘Stupid F###ing Bird’ 
brings all of that very vigorously to 
the surface.”

In this way, the play honors 

Chekov by reimagining his story 
and bringing it into a contem-
porary setting. Since the idea of 
retelling and recapitulating sto-
ries is in itself traditional, Cantor 
points out, “Stupid F###ing Bird” 
preserves a classical element.

The play has a cast of seven, 

with some surprise performances 
from the crew, and includes move-
ment and dance as well as live 
music. There seems to be some-
thing to appreciate for everyone in 
this: Chekov lovers, comedy lovers, 
theatergoers, 18-year-olds search-
ing for angst and curse words, and 
romantics.

When I asked Cantor what he 

thought the simplified, main mes-
sage of the play might be, about 
love or theater, he said, “Well, I 
don’t think there is a message. It 
just asks questions and explores 
possibilities. It explores contradic-
tions, imperfections and asymme-
tries.”

‘Bird’ isn’t so stupid

‘Majora’s Mask 3D’ 
explores the reality 

of death

By JACOB RICH

Daily Film Editor

Death pervades mainstream 

gaming. Health bars and the cycle 
of dying and respawning are seem-
ingly 
inescap-

able tropes that 
video games have 
been 
structured 

around since the 
earliest days of 
the arcade. Yet 
very few games 
are actually about 
death. Dying in a 
video game rarely 
means more than 
“well shit, time to 

try again.”

In the year 2000, one Nintendo 

game dared to explore death as 
the mysterious, terrifying thing it 
really is. In doing so, it created one 

of the greatest video games ever 
made.

“The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s 

Mask” is the definitive black sheep 
of the Nintendo library — a dark,

Mask 3D’

3DS 
Exclusive

Nintendo

NINTENDO

“It puts the lotion on the skin or else it gets the hose again.”

mature, offbeat side story that 
takes the excellent core gameplay 
the “Zelda” franchise is known for 
and twists it, using a unique time 
travel mechanic to explore the 
concepts of the passage of time and 
mortality itself.

This 2015 release is its 3DS 

remake, the same game with a 
graphical overhaul and numerous 
improvements to its gameplay and 
save system.

Sent back in time after the events 

of “Ocarina of Time” to relive his 
childhood, player surrogate Link 
sets out on a quest to reunite with 
his fairy companion, Navi. Myste-
riously, he ends up stumbling upon 
Termina, a dreamlike parallel 
world to his homeland of Hyrule. 
Soon, he discovers that a bullied, 
Gollum-like creature named Skull 
Kid accidentally attained great 
power with the help of a magical 
mask and is intent on crashing the 
moon into the earth, ending all life.

“Majora’s Mask” bends this 

classic “end of the world” fantasy 
trope to its will, using a countdown 
timer and a world whose denizens 
go through real-life daily sched-
ules to give the incoming apoca-
lypse a real sense of imminent 
doom. In the three days prior to 
the world’s end, the game’s char-
acters begin to figure out that they 

will soon die. The player watches 
in horror as the townsfolk go from 
cheerful to cautious to cowering 
and crying, helpless in avoiding 
their own demise.

However, there is hope — using 

his trusty magic ocarina, Link can 
restart the three-day cycle at will, 
appearing at the beginning of the 
first day, “Groundhog Day”-style. 
The player must live these three 
days over and over again in order 
to figure out how to stop the moon 
from crashing. While the citizens 
of Termina are unaware of these 
three days repeating again and 
again, the player slowly but surely 
gains knowledge and power. By 
helping the people of Termina 
and completing dungeons, Link 
obtains helpful equipment as 
well as magical masks that grant 
him unique powers. It’s a genius, 
rewarding gameplay mechanic 
that has not been replicated in the 
fifteen years the game has been 
out.

While the original release’s 

genius was somewhat hampered 
by instances of rather obtuse logic 
in its puzzle solutions and a weak 
save system, this 3DS remake 
addresses those problems excel-
lently. It implements an improved 
quest-log system that more closely 
resembles one of a western RPG 

like “Skyrim,” a hint system to help 
with the more confusing puzzles, 
and adds tons of extra places to 
hard-save the game. IGN’s excel-
lent article detailing the full extent 
of the improvements and changes 
can be found here. Most of these 
improvements are excellent, less-
ening the game’s structural issues 
and bringing its thematic and 
philosophical elements to the fore-
front.

“Majora’s Mask 3D,” like its 

original release, isn’t perfect. 
One of the game’s four lengthy 
dungeons is significantly more 
tedious to complete than the 
rest, and a mandatory late-game 
trading sequence quest serves 
to annoy instead of entertain. In 
addition, a helpful swimming 
ability gained halfway through 
the game is inexplicably made 
less effective in the 3DS version. 
Weird.

Despite this, “Majora’s Mask 

3D” 
stands 
as 
an 
excellent 

improvement to one of the most 
daring games in history, a vast 
departure from its franchise that 
explores the human condition in a 
way no other video game has.

When lead singer Dan Reynolds 

stated that Imagine Dragons was 
an “atypical band,” he meant the 
opposite of what 
conclusion 
you 

might come to. The 
rock group is atyp-
ical for being, well, 
typical people — 
not 
necessarily 

the 
drugged-out 

hyper-artsy types.

The group isn’t 

constantly 
turn-

ing creative corners, and its mass 
appeal doesn’t just accumulate 
album sales, but many radio hits as 
well — longevity that’s proven to be 
unattainable for pop-rock groups 
of the past few years. Its willing-
ness to make commercially rea-
sonable decisions (like its recent 
$8 million live Target ad-perfor-
mance during the Grammys) is 
what keeps the wheels turning on 
this record, released on the heels of 
its internationally acclaimed Night 
Visions.

The group was off to a rocky 

start with its record’s lead single 
“I Bet My Life,” which fell some-
where between a Mumford & Sons 
hit and the instrumental track for a 
coming-of-age themed movie trail-
er, but eventually found its former 
sonic footing in the release of its 
follow-up promotional singles — 
the pop-hot “Shots” and sonically 
biting “Gold.”

Take Imagine Dragons for what 

it is — a producer-driven band as 
a front for Reynolds’s vocal per-
formances — and you’ll find wise 
decision-making left and right, 
such as re-hiring Alex Da Kid for 
another round. The “Love the Way 
You Lie” producer engineers the 
group’s notoriously gritty synths 
that come with an edge of hip-hop 
beat samples (which often over-
step any sense of being a rock band, 
but successfully separate Imagine 
Dragons 
from 
pansy-pop-rock 

groups like Maroon 5 and Cold-
play).

However, that being said, Imag-

ine Dragons retains some Cold-
play-esque leans. The album is 
sequenced to balance every bass-
pounding track with a treble-driv-
en counterpart (hence introducing 

the record with “Shots,” swapping 
to a hard-hitting “Gold,” switching 
back to an airier “Smoke + Mir-
rors,” and trading off from there 
on out). But given how Coldplay 
underwhelmed with Ghost Stories 
— the watered-down follow-up to 
its widespread Mylo Xyloto elec-
tro-rock success — perhaps there’s 
some wiggle room for Imagine 
Dragons to expand on the new-
found gap.

The Las Vegas band has the lux-

ury of being able to linger around 
in its same style for this sophomore 
record, but might not be so fortu-
nate in its plans for the coming 
year. Pop-rock artists fall victim to 
monotony more so than any oth-
ers, and a sonic do-over is in order 
for album number three.

There continues to be some 

‘smoke and mirrors’ that surround 
Imagine Dragon’s productions, 
and its “night visions” tend to be 
somewhat narrow, but the group’s 
upfront honesty regarding its 
standing in commercialized rock 
has managed to keep the topic out 
of the limelight. And there’s some-
thing to be said about maintaining 
the writing credits within its work.

Harbaugh teaches NFL prospects

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Two 
college-aged 
men 

engaged in a debate typical of 
the basketball courts of the 
Intramural Sports Building on 
Tuesday afternoon. They had just 
finished playing three games of 
H-O-R-S-E in the farthest corner 
of the gym, and they continued the 
one-upmanship associated with 
the classic backyard basketball 
game.

The only difference is that the 

typical debate on the intramural 
courts isn’t between a Heisman 
Trophy winner and another NFL-
bound quarterback.

Bryce Petty had won two games 

to Jameis Winston’s one, and 
the former Baylor quarterback 
wanted to make sure everyone 
around him knew.

Winston, 
though, 
was 

unimpressed by Petty’s slight 
advantage in the games they 
played with members of an 
ESPN 
film 
crew 
following 

the quarterbacks during their 
preparation for the NFL Draft.

“I’m the champ,” the former 

Florida State quarterback and 
2013 Heisman Trophy winner 
said. “I’m just resting right now. 
You know what I’m saying? Don’t 
listen to that sucker. That’s what I 
do. I win.”

The two have spent two days in 

Ann Arbor with their quarterback 
coach, George Whitfield, as they 
prepare for the NFL Combine 
on Wednesday in Indianapolis, 
where every move they make will 
be critiqued.

Winston 
and 
Petty 
had 

been 
training 
at 
Whitfield’s 

headquarters 
in 
San 
Diego 

but arrived in the Midwest to 
adjust to the cold and get off of 
Pacific Standard Time before the 
combine begins.

Winston is widely expected to 

be one of the top picks in the NFL 
Draft on April 30, and multiple 
experts have Petty tabbed as a 

mid-first round pick. During their 
brief time in Ann Arbor, Winston 
and Petty have worked out in 
Michigan’s practice facilities with 
Wolverine wide receivers.

Another main draw of the trip 

was the chance to learn from 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, 
albeit off of the practice field 
because of NCAA regulations 
restricting 
how 
much 
time 

Harbaugh can spend with players 
on the field at this time of the year.

Harbaugh and Whitfield have 

been close friends for years, so 
Whitfield thought working in Ann 
Arbor would be beneficial for the 
young quarterbacks.

“His 
résumé 
speaks 
for 

himself,” Petty told the Daily. “If 
you know anything about football, 
you know Coach Harbaugh. It’s 
been a blast really getting to talk 
and sit down with him, just to 
get his advice, his expertise on 
football and on evaluating and 
what they’re looking for.

“You don’t get there without 

being legendary, really. He knows 
so much about football, has so 
much to offer as far as the position 
because he played quarterback 

(and because of) the position as 
a head coach in the NFL, what 
they’re looking for, how to take on 
going from college to the NFL.”

Added Winston: “These kids 

are very lucky. Coach Harbaugh 
is a blessing to this program, 
and they’re going to win a lot of 
games.”

Since Harbaugh couldn’t watch 

the quarterbacks throw, he spent 
much of his time advising them on 
how they should carry themselves 
in an NFL locker room.

“He was telling us that as a 

quarterback in the NFL, you really 
got to be the first one in there, last 
one to leave,” Petty said. “It’s a 
job, and so you’ve got to treat it as 
such. Just be professional in what 
you’re doing and be yourself.”

Both 
quarterbacks 
have 

positive reports about their time 
off of the football field in Ann 
Arbor so far. They ate a meal at 
Mister Spots; Winston ordered a 
steak sandwich. Petty hoped to 
try Zingerman’s Deli on Tuesday 
evening. The quarterbacks also 
have plans to attend the Michigan 
men’s basketball game against 
Michigan State later Tuesday 

night.

Winston wasn’t fazed by the 

chilly weather that failed to reach 
20 degrees during his visit.

“I loved the weather, I ain’t 

seen snow all year,” Winston said. 
“That was a great thing, just out 
here just enjoying the facilities. 
This campus is so pretty.”

Added Petty: “As far as facilities 

go, football-wise, shoot, I don’t 
know how you turn Michigan 
down. It’s kind of crazy as far as 
what they’re offered here to call 
home.”

There was one facility in Ann 

Arbor where the star quarterbacks 
couldn’t spend as much time as 
they wanted to. It just happened 
to be the Intramural Sports 
Building, where being an NFL-
bound athlete is no prerequisite to 
superstardom.

As 5 p.m. approached, Winston, 

Petty and their film crew were 
asked to leave the courts so that 
preparation for Tuesday night’s 
intramural 
basketball 
games 

could begin. For one last time 
before their NFL careers begin, 
Winston and Petty were just your 
average college students.

Behind Enemy Lines:
Indiana coach Teri Moren

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Writer

It would be an understatement 

to say that the Michigan women’s 
basketball team is reeling.

After losing at Ohio State in a 

game in which the Wolverines 
led by as many as 12 with less 
than 
10 

minutes 
remaining 
in 
the 

game, they 
traveled 
home 
to 

Ann Arbor 
to take on Northwestern on 
Saturday.

But Michigan (4-10 Big Ten, 

14-11 overall) didn’t fare much 
better.

After leading all game, the 

Wolverines faltered down the 
stretch before Wildcat forward 
Nia Coffey took the ball cross-
court for a game-winning layup 
to stun Michigan, 63-62.

“It was a tough game for 

us,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico on WTKA Radio. 
“But sometimes you need those 
kinds of games to learn and 
to grow and to get better. It’s 
kind of been a tough stretch for 
our kids because we’ve been so 
close, but I think it’ll pay off.”

Wednesday, the Wolverines 

will get a chance to get past the 
two heartbreaking losses when 
Indiana comes to town.

The Hoosiers (4-10, 4-11) 

travel to Ann Arbor following 
a loss to Iowa in which the 
Hawkeyes shot 61.3 percent in 
the second half to run away with 
an 81-64 victory.

Indiana coach Teri Moren’s 

team is led in scoring by guard 
Larryn Brooks, who averages 
13.8 
points, 
while 
forward 

Amanda Cahill leads the team in 
rebounding with 8.1 boards per 
game.

With just four upperclassmen 

on the roster, the underclassmen 
carry most of the playing time, 

and Moren starts five of them 
— three sophomores and two 
freshmen. Freshman guard Jess 
Walter is usually the first off the 
bench for the Hoosiers.

“Indiana’s a young team with a 

lot of freshmen and sophomores, 
so they’re kind of fearless,” 
Barnes Arico said. “They shoot 
about 20 (3-pointers) a half, not 
even in a game, so they will come 
out firing.”

While the Hoosiers sit in 

ninth place in the Big Ten, they 
started off the season strong, 
going 10-1 in the non-conference 
portion of their schedule.

But 
Indiana, 
like 
the 

Wolverines, has learned just 
how good the Big Ten is and 
has 
struggled 
against 
the 

competition.

The Daily sat down with 

Moren — currently in her first 
season with Indiana after four 
years at Indiana State — at Big 
Ten Media Day in October to 
discuss the Hoosiers’ upcoming 
season.

The Michigan Daily: It’s 

your first year with Indiana. 
What are your expectations for 
the team this year?

Teri 
Moren: 
Our 

expectations are really simple. 
It’s going to sound pretty cliché, 
but we’re just going to try to 
get better every day. This is a 
new staff, and we’re trying to 
implement some different things. 
Our emphasis has been on the 
defensive end. The only thing we 
can ask from our players is that 
they come with energy and great 
effort, and if they do those two 
things and they’re coachable, 
we know we’re going to make 
progress. We want to feel really 
good about each practice and 
know that we got better at the 
end of the day.

TMD: 
You 
come 
from 

Indiana State, a little bit of 
a smaller school. What’s the 
biggest challenge for you in the 
transition?

TM: I’ve been at Division 

II schools, I’ve been in the 
(Athletic Coast Conference), and 
as you mentioned, the (Missouri) 
Valley, all really good stops. The 
game’s not taught any different, 
it’s just the magnitude of the Big 
Ten and being at a school like 
Indiana and wanting to build a 
tradition. Nobody’s going to put 
more pressure on themselves 
than I will, but I’ve always been 
like that at any of my stops. 
Indiana’s a special place for a lot 
of reasons, but there’s no reason 
why Indiana women’s basketball 
can’t have the tradition that our 
men’s team has.

TMD: You come in after 

the sudden resignation of Curt 
Miller. How do you win over the 
team right away?

TM: The relationship part 

of it is so important. I’m a 
relationship coach. I think John 
Wooden always said, “Your 
players don’t care how much 
you know, until they know how 
much you care,” and I’ve used 
that forever, and I think it’s 
important in this day and age 
that our players understand how 
much I care about them, and that 
I care about every aspect of their 
lives.

I want to help them succeed 

in the classroom, succeed as 
people, succeed as basketball 
players, and be successful later 
in life. I’ve asked the players to 
come into the office. I’ve had 
to play catch-up with them, so 
it was really important that I 
get a lot of face time with them. 
But I’ll tell you this: I think 
the players wanted to build 
that relationship, as much as I 
wanted to build the relationship 
with them, so it was really a two-
way street. We both had to make 
the effort, for the players to come 
in the office and be around us, go 
to football games, sit with us, 
have dinners. All of it has been 
instrumental in playing catch-
up with this group and building 
that trust, and this group has 
been really open to that.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Cutler Martin’s other love

By JASON RUBINSTEIN 

Daily Sports Editor

During his freshman year of 

high school, Cutler Martin made 
an opponent cry — but not on 
the ice. Instead, the freshman 
defenseman for the Michigan 
hockey 
team 
was 
making 

enemies on the tennis court.

Martin, a standout tennis 

player at East Lansing High 
School, where his team won a 
state championship in 2008, was 
playing in a “big tournament,” 
when he found himself in a 
critical 
quarterfinal 
match. 

Martin won the first set, 6-0, 
lost the second, 7-5, and was 
in a contested third set before 
Martin became too much for his 
opponent to handle.

“I 
was 

smoking 
the 

ball 
pretty 

good,” Martin 
said. “I don’t 
think this kid 
was used to 
losing 
and, 

you know, I 
was creating my own energy, and 
I hit a ball and he called it out. 
I challenged him and the line 
judge called it in.

“He started ripping me, and 

I exchanged words as well, 
and he broke down into tears. I 
think that was the demise of the 
match, and I ended up beating 
him.”

Martin’s creative use of words 

didn’t just come out of nowhere, 
though. It stemmed from his 
many years playing his true 
love, hockey, a sport that Martin 
admits is far different from 
tennis at face value.

Martin’s competitive tennis 

career, at least for now, is over. 
He’s currently one of the bright 
spots 
of 
Michigan’s 
shaky 

defensive corps. A big part of 
that success, Martin said, is 
because of the skills he learned 
playing tennis.

“Tennis 
always 
helped 

me train for hockey — a lot 
of 
running, 
exercising 
and 

training,” Martin said. “Hockey 
was always my main focus 

growing up, but tennis really 
helped me become a better 
hockey player.

“It’s a sport you can really 

struggle with if you’re not 
mentally strong. Like anything, 
you have to work at it, build 
confidence through repetition. 
Tennis was the exact same 
way, because you have to have 
confidence to perform and if you 
don’t, you’re going to lose.”

Martin has taken all he has 

learned 
mentally 
from 
the 

tennis court and translated it 
into his hockey playing style. He 
knows he’s prone to mistakes 
during a game, but moving past 
them is crucial to maintaining 
composure.

Playing 
tennis, 
Martin 

said, helped teach him how 

to do this. In 
tennis, 
one 

double 
fault 

can compound 
into 
five. 

One 
botched 

line call can 
completely 
change 
a 

match’s course. Martin quickly 
learned 
this, 
and 
figured 

out how to mentally drain 
opponents beyond his already 
physical playing style.

“He was the strongest guy I 

have ever I coached,” said East 
Lansing High School men’s 
tennis coach Karim Jelassi. “He 
was always lifting weights.”

However, Martin — a two-

time 
Michigan 
All-State 

selection — wasn’t invisible to 
tennis’ mental onslaught. In the 
2010 state semifinals, Martin 
found himself winning 5-2 in 
the third set. But after a series of 
unforced errors, the frustration 
grew and grew, and Martin 
eventually lost the set and 
match, ending his high school 
tennis career. The loss prompted 
Martin to throw his racket at the 
fence.

“I was invested in the game,” 

Martin said. “I didn’t necessarily 
agree with the outcome, so 
throwing the racket at the fence 
was the best thing I could think 
of. In retrospect, that probably 

wasn’t a good idea.”

Good idea or not, that match 

ended what could have been a 
special tennis career, according 
to Jelassi.

Had Martin translated all 

his hours playing hockey games 
into tennis matches, and hockey 
practice into tennis practice, 
Jelassi believes Martin could 
have been the best player in the 
Midwest.

“He 
was 
very 
strong 

physically,” he said, “so I believe 
if he just focused in tennis, he 
could’ve been the top guy in the 
Midwest. He didn’t like to lose. I 
believe he could’ve made it to the 
top.”

Jelassi 
added 
that 
a 

scholarship to Michigan or 
Michigan State, or any top 
program, would have been a 
no-brainer. And Martin’s old 
coach’s comments had him 
wondering 
what 
his 
tennis 

career could have blossomed 
into. However, he has no regrets 
and appreciates what tennis has 
brought to his hockey game.

Now in Ann Arbor, Martin 

has little free time between 
hockey 
and 
schoolwork 
— 

playing tennis has become a 
distant memory.

But luckily for Martin, when 

summer 
rolls 
around 
and 

hockey season is over, he’ll have 
someone to hit with: freshman 
forward Dylan Larkin. Though 
Larkin has never played tennis 
competitively, he’s confident in 
his game.

Initially, Larkin thought he 

could defeat Martin.

“He’s a big guy, probably a 

strong serve,” Larkin said.

Larkin’s sentiment changed 

after 
being 
reminded 
that 

Martin was a state champion.

“He’d probably beat me,” 

Larkin said while laughing. “... 
I think maybe by the end of the 
summer, I could take him.”

Martin obviously disagreed. 

However, one of his key tactics 
in 
high 
school 
— 
wearing 

opponents down mentally — 
won’t work against Larkin.

“I’m not worried about that,” 

Larkin said.

ICE HOCKEY

Jacobson leads
experienced ‘M’

By BEN FIDELMAN 

Daily Sports Writer

If you ask Michigan baseball 

coach Erik Bakich what his favor-
ite thing about second baseman 
Eric Jacobson is, he won’t waver 
in his answer: Jacobson is a true 
Michigan Man.

After paying his dues sitting on 

the bench for much of his time as 
an underclassman, the senior has 
solidified his position as a start-
ing infielder — something coaches 
will tell you he earned with more 
than just his on-field perfor-
mance.

“What separates Eric Jacobson 

from everyone else is the talent he 
has between the ears,” Bakich said. 
“His leadership skills have blos-
somed at Michigan. He’s an out-
standing student and is graduating 
from the Ross School of Business 
with a business administration 
degree. He has good relationships 
with everyone within the team and 
has turned himself into a very good 
player on the field.”

Those traits led to Jacobson’s 

selection to the team’s leadership 
council this season.

He first took over the start-

ing job at second base toward the 
beginning of the 2014 campaign 
and held his own on both sides of 
the ball, maintaining a .243 bat-
ting average and not committing a 
single error in any of the 38 games 
he appeared in.

“On the field, he knows who 

he is,” Bakich said. “He is com-
fortable in his own skin. He 
knows he’s not a power hitter or 
a blazing-speed runner. He is an 
extremely solid defender and reli-
able hitter.”

Jacobson usually rounds off the 

Wolverine batting order in the No. 
9 hole, a spot that often calls for 
him to sacrifice his at-bat to move 

any base runners from the bottom 
of the lineup up 90 feet to be in 
scoring position for the top of the 
order. Occasionally, however, he’s 
called upon to come through with 
a big hit.

One of those occasions pre-

sented itself last weekend, while 
Michigan was in the final game of 
a three-game series against Long 
Beach State. The Wolverines (1-2) 
had dropped the first two match-
ups and were hanging onto a 1-0 
lead in the Sunday finale when 
Jacobson stepped to the plate in 
the top of the fourth with two 
runners in scoring position and 
two outs.

He yanked a single through the 

left side of the infield, scoring both 
runners and giving the Wolver-
ines a 3-0 lead. Michigan ended up 
giving away the lead in the bottom 
of the ninth inning, but won 5-3 in 
extras to salvage the weekend.

The eventual game-winning hit 

came from the bat of junior first 
baseman Jacob Cronenworth — 
another prominent leader. Many 
believe that a key for the team’s 
success this year will stem from 
veteran experience holding the 
team together late in games, lead-
ership that will push the young 
talent on the team to perform in 
crunch time. Jacobson led that 
charge Sunday in exciting fashion.

“Hopefully it epitomizes the 

team this year,” Jacobson said. 
“We took some punches and came 
back and showed great will and 
toughness.

Whatever 
consistency 
isn’t 

accounted for in Jacobson’s career 
.225 batting average is clearly evi-
dent in his off-field life — some-
thing the coaching staff considers 
to be much more important.

“He’s consistent in everything 

he does in his life, and doesn’t 
have many highs or lows mental-

Former players reflect

By DANIEL FELDMAN

Daily Sports Editor

It was like Nik Stauskas hadn’t 

missed a step when he was told to 
go in a corner of the Crisler Center 
media room for an interview.

Into the far left end of the 

room Stauskas went, back in his 
usual spot for postgame interview 
sessions. The former Wolverine 
was at ease in his home for two 
collegiate seasons at Michigan.

It’s far different than the year 

he has experienced so far with the 
Sacramento Kings.

The rookie has averaged just 

13.6 minutes per game so far while 
producing a mere 3.4 points per 
contest. To boot, Stauskas will 
now have his third head coach in 
53 games with George Karl now 
on board.

The NBA has been a culture 

shock for Stauskas. No longer is he 
the No. 1 option on offense. Now, 
he’s lucky to get a couple of shots 
per game, or even a few minutes.

That’s why his little stopover in 

Ann Arbor means so much to him.

“It’s been different for me,” he 

said. “I’m used to being here at 
Michigan. For two years we had a 
lot of stability — coaches, a lot of 
the same players.”

Being back in Ann Arbor gave 

Stauskas the chance to emphasize 
the importance of the rivalry 
between Michigan and Michigan 

State in a pregame speech to the 
current team.

While his main message to the 

team was to simply have fun, it 
was clear he still wished he could 
help the Wolverines, as evidenced 
by his joke that he wanted “to 
steal (Andrew) Dakich’s jersey 
for a couple of minutes and go out 
there.”

However, watching from the 

stands would have to do.

“It’s just one of those things 

when you see Michigan State on 
the other side of the court,” he 
said. “There’s a part of me that no 
matter what, I always want to go 
out there and have an effect on the 
game. That’s just what this rivalry 
does to you after a few years. It’s 
different being on the sidelines 
and watching the game there.”

Stauskas 
wasn’t 
the 
only 

former Wolverine who returned 
to Michigan on Tuesday. Also 
making a cameo was Glenn 
Robinson 
III, 
now 
of 
the 

Minnesota Timberwolves.

Similar to Stauskas, Robinson 

has had to adjust to finding his 
niche in the NBA. While more was 
expected of Stauskas, the eighth 
overall pick of last year’s draft, 
Robinson, a second-round pick, 
is using this year to grow into his 
body.

When 
Robinson 
was 
at 

Michigan, 
fans 
consistently 

wondered about when he would 

leave for the NBA.

With Caris LeVert potentially 

facing a similar dilemma at the 
end of this season, Robinson 
wanted the junior guard to know 
that he should talk to him before 
making any final decision.

“I told Caris when that time 

comes at the end of the season, 
whenever that might be, to give 
me a call and we’ll talk,” he said. 
“I know how it is to be in that 
situation, the pressure that you 
feel.”

The third former Wolverine 

to return to Crisler was Jordan 
Morgan. While Robinson spoke 
with the team on Monday and 
Stauskas made his own speech 
prior to the game Tuesday, 
Morgan also wanted to make 
to sure the team understood 
the importance of the rivalry 
game when he spoke with the 
Wolverines 
before 
Tuesday’s 

game.

“I just wanted to stress to 

our team the importance of this 
Michigan State game and the 
fact that what you do in this 
game against Michigan State 
to 
everybody 
around 
these 

programs,” Morgan said. “This 
game means everything. It doesn’t 
matter what you accomplish that 
year, whether you don’t do well or 
you go to the championship, what 
people are going to remember is 
what you did in that game.”

Slow first half dooms ‘M’ 
in blowout loss to MSU

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman contributed 12 points in Michigan’s double-digit defeat.

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

For most of the second half 

Tuesday night, Michigan and 
Michigan State gave fans the 
basketball 
game 
they 
were 

expecting — a back-and-forth, 
high-
energy 
affair.

The 

problem was that Michigan 
State went into the half already 
up by 15, and while Michigan 
looked 
vastly 
improved 
in 

second frame, the Spartans 
never slowed down.

Michigan State used a highly 

efficient 
offensive 
attack, 

spearheaded 
by 
Branden 

Dawson and Travis Trice, to 
stifle any chance of a Wolverine 
comeback, 
cruising 
to 
an 

80-67 win at Crisler Center 
and handing Michigan its fifth 
straight loss.

Trice and Dawson finished 

with 
22 
and 
23 
points, 

respectively, and led a Spartan 
team that shot 62 percent from 
the floor. Dominating both the 
floor and the air space down 
low, Dawson in particular made 
his presence felt, adding 13 
rebounds, four of them on the 
offensive glass.

“Dawson was at an elite level 

as far as scoring over people,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein. “He played as high up 
in Crisler as anyone has ever 
played since I’ve been here. He 
really did some great things.”

Perhaps his most important 

contribution, 
though, 
was 

that his performance in the 
offensive post kept Michigan 

from clawing back into the 
game 
in 
the 
second 
half. 

Whereas the Wolverines have 
made up for poor first halves 
with monster comebacks in 
other games, Dawson made 
sure that when Michigan made 
its run, it didn’t amount to 
much.

And 
Michigan 
did 
make 

its 
run. 
Freshman 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman 
hit 
back-to-back 

3-pointers on the Wolverines’ 
first two possessions of the half 
and a jumper from the key on 
their third, but it was always 
met with a response from the 
Spartans.

Dawson and Gavin Schilling 

hit floaters, grabbed offensive 
rebounds 
and 
threw 
down 

thunderous dunks to prevent 
Michigan 
from 
generating 

much momentum.

The Wolverines’ hot start 

included 12 points in the first 
5:09 of the second half, but that 
spurt only got them within 11. 
Michigan trimmed the margin 
to as slim as 10 points in the 
second half, but didn’t have 
nearly enough to erase the wide 
halftime deficit.

“The problem is, we were 

going on our runs, we were 
scoring the basketball, we were 
just trading buckets,” said junior 
guard Spike Albrecht. “You’ve 
got to be able to get stops to go 
on runs, and things like that and 
we just couldn’t seem to get that 
one stop or that one big rebound 
to get us over the hump. You’ve 
got to credit them for that.”

The game got out of hand 

early, as the Wolverines trailed 
38-23 at the end of the first half 

and looked bad doing so. The 
Spartans used a 3-point barrage 
from guards Travis Trice, Bryn 
Forbes and Lourawls “Tum 
Tum” Nairn to build their lead 
to as much as 19.

Part of that huge tally was the 

fact that Michigan State simply 
couldn’t be stopped, shooting 
16-for-27 from the field in the 
first half. Dawson shot 4-for-4 
from the floor in the opening 
frame and Trice was 4-for-
7, including 75 percent from 
behind the arc.

But the Wolverines couldn’t 

get anything going on offense 
to counter in the first half. 
Sophomore forward Zak Irvin 
scored 
Michigan’s 
first 
six 

points on three layups, but the 
Wolverines struggled mightily, 
especially when forced into 
jump shots.

Michigan State’s persistence 

made a comeback too tall a task 
for Michigan, despite the fact 
that the Wolverines actually 
outscored the Spartans in the 
second half. Michigan State, 
which hadn’t won at Crisler 
Center 
since 
2010, 
simply 

wouldn’t let this one slip away.

“We were going to have 

to 
everything 
right 
(to 

make a comeback) and we 
didn’t do that,” Beilein said. 
“That first-half lead was not 
insurmountable. We’ve done 
that before. It’s tough against 
these guys, just because they 
get 
their 
second-chance 

opportunities, and they didn’t 
get wild and crazy with the 
ball. They didn’t turn the ball 
over. … They didn’t help us 
get back in. They didn’t beat 
themselves.”

Footnotes: Life in the MLB

I

t’s always surprised me 
how many classes I have 
in the Modern Languages 

Building — at least one each 
semester since I started at the 
University. On such an expan-
sive campus, one on which I’ve 
yet to enter a good number of 
the buildings, it seems odd to 
spend such a great deal of time 
in one auditorium.

Sitting in a 400-person lec-

ture halls, I am always tempted 
to surf the web, check my texts, 
and lose focus on the topic 
at hand — education. From 
a quick glance around the room, I 
would say that I’m not alone in that 
respect.

Shelly Schreier and her Golden-

Apple-winning lectures can capti-
vate an audience with the same flare 
as a Shakespearean performance, but 
I’ve found many professors, through 
no fault of their own, cannot.

This isn’t surprising. The profes-

sors at this University weren’t hired 
because they are world-renowned 
public speakers, or because they have 
personalities that fill an auditorium. 
They were brought to Ann Arbor 
because they are simply the most 
brilliant minds in their respective 
fields of study.

After delivering a lackluster lec-

ture, many of these doctors of sci-
ence and humanities will head back 
to their office and literally change 
the world through their academic 
exploits.

Why then, do we expect them to 

stand in front of a lecture hall and 
keep the attention of college students 
— perhaps the most easily distractible 
demographic in recorded history?

Freshman year, when I was in 

Schreier’s Psychology 111 class, I was 
concurrently enrolled in an Organic 
Chemistry lab. My GSI, who now 
works somewhere in the biotech 
realm of the Silicon Valley, was not 
particularly adept in teaching. Even 
so, I remember the class being valu-
able in seeing the practical applica-
tions behind the work we learned in 
lecture.

Don’t get me wrong — organic 

chem lab is a special kind of Hell 
that I wouldn’t wish onto my worst 
enemy. Enrolling in the 8:00 a.m. 
Friday section of a four-hour lab 
doesn’t help either. But, at the end 
of the day, you learn a lot and gain 
an appreciation for the chemistry 

behind basic science.

Similarly, I remember volunteer-

ing in a lab at the medical school 
before I had even completed my intro 
bio sequence. Thanks to interactions 
with one professor and one patient 
postdoc, I learned more in some 
afternoons than I would in months of 
a standard lecture course.

In case any students have missed 

the memo, this is one of the largest, 
most advanced research universities 
in the world.

When I was applying to Michigan, 

I remember that some of the smaller 
colleges would market themselves 
based on their student-to-faculty 
ratio or the number of classes under 
thirty students. These are all valu-
able measures, but don’t necessarily 
assure a quality education. Having 
professors on campus doesn’t help 
students unless those professors are 
truly accessible.

The University could make moves 

to reform its current systems. Some 
professors should not ever be placed 
in front of lecture halls. But that 
doesn’t mean students cannot take 
full advantage of their expertise in 
other ways. It’s up to those individu-
als on both side of the equation — stu-
dents and teachers — to make sure 
the University is getting full use of 
the $1.3 dollar research enterprise 
that has developed over the last 198 
years.

Take teachers out of the lecture 

halls, and put them back in the labs 
where they are more comfortable. 
Let students develop meaningful 
connections with these experts and, 
at the same time, learn in the envi-
ronment where they will eventually 
be working.

Professors standing awkwardly on 

stage in the MLB doesn’t do anyone 
any favors.

our neighborhood — it’s 
more than a street name.

If you live within walk-

ing distance of Hatcher, you’re 
most absolutely a student, and 
you almost certainly have posi-
tioned yourself based on the net-
work in which you frequent.

You live on Packard? You like 

a good party more than anything.

Hill and Tappan? You’re a Ross 

kid.

Kerrytown? Hipster … or engi-

neer.

Landmark? Zaragon? Frat star.
Or … maybe not.
When I was deciding where to 

live, it never felt like a decision at 
all. Yes, I chose to live in a cer-
tain neighborhood with a certain 
group of people, but off-campus 
housing feels a lot less like a ratio-
nal decision and a lot more like a 
confusing blur of houses, apart-
ments, and questionable land-
lords that all ends with you living 
in an overpriced closet.

As enrollment rates increase 

and the number of on-campus 
rooms remains the same, fresh-
man more often than not end 
up being forced to explore Ann 
Arbor for the very first time as 
they search for a place to live the 
following year. For the freshmen 
and upperclassmen who scramble 
to find off-campus housing, they 
are reaching out to landlords, 
talking to residents, visiting hous-
es in different areas, and usually 
start by deciding: apartment or 
house?

Apartment seems to be the 

easier option of the two. Houses 
are complicated, while apart-
ments frequented by students are 
glorified dorms.

These “glorified dorms” how-

ever, are remarkably unpopular 
among non-student residents. 
Townies are often angered by 
expensive, blocky buildings that 
neither meet the city’s announced 
goal of increasing affordable 
housing downtown nor the desire 
to preserve Ann Arbor’s unique 
character. For every apartment 
building that goes up in an effort 
to target students, local resi-
dents are almost always quick 
to respond. They challenge the 
proximity of the building to their 
parks and neighborhoods, full of 
fear and foreboding for the future 
of Ann Arbor.

The tension between residents 

and students is not uncommon, 
but is particularly apparent in a 
college town with such vibrant 
and diverse experiences in the 
city and on campus.

So let me tell you a story.
The day I was born, while 

I was still at the hospital, my 
eight-year-old brother and father 
bought me a bear. I, creatively, 
named him Barry the Bear. My 
brother had had a similar bear 
named Fuzzy, given to him when 
he was born, that he loved and 
that can be found in my parents’ 
living room, all torn up and worn. 
My bear is there too, but he isn’t 
worn … actually, he looks entirely 
untouched. Exactly the way it had 
been given to me.

Instead, in my bedroom here 

in Ann Arbor, you will find a flat-
tened out, greenish Alligator, who 
I also very creatively named Allie 
the Alligator, laying on my bed. 
He has stains everywhere and 
his cloth teeth have wrinkled and 
torn over the years.

Barry was special to me. And 

because he was special, I wanted 
to take care of him. I didn’t take 
him with me outside, or to day-
care, or on the bus, or with me to 
college. But Allie, who was just 
a meaningless alligator, came 
everywhere with me.

Ann Arbor is special as well. 

And while my place is not to say 
what is right for this city, nei-
ther fearing change and desir-
ing things to stay the same nor 
rushing to capitalize on students 
desperate for nearby housing 
with poorly thought out buildings 
seem like strategies the constitu-
ents in this city — both students 
and residents — desire.

The truth is, we all have a lot to 

lose. The University has a lot to 
lose if the essence of Ann Arbor 
as a town is harmed, as do the stu-
dents. And residents, who know 
and love Ann Arbor’s character, 
would undoubtedly feel an impact 
if the University was unable to 
bring such a large and diverse 
group of young adults to the city.

The University enrolls over 

43,000 students each year, and 
they all have to find somewhere 
to live.

In the process each student 

will make some decisions that 
say a lot about him or her, wheth-
er they realize it or not: where 
you live, what kinds of people 
you choose to support, who you 
decide to live with. But you will, 
ultimately, call Ann Arbor your 
home. And in doing so, you join a 
much larger community, one that 
isn’t included in those enrollment 
numbers, that is worth exploring. 
Off-campus housing just may be 
your chance to do so.

THE LITERARY 

ISSUE

Wednesday, February 18, 2015 // The Statement 3B

O

ne fateful January night, I 
downloaded Trivia Crack 
— a smartphone app based 

around answering trivia questions 
in a variety of categories — and pro-
ceeded to beat several of my friends 
for ten straight games.

Omg why are you so good? my 

friend Jessica asked in the app’s 
chat function.

Lol, I replied, adding two nail-

painting Emojis for good measure.

It wasn’t until Trivia Crack that 

I realized how much useless infor-
mation I had actually managed 
store in my brain from years of 
hardcore Internet-ing and my par-
ents’ general lack of observation.

Here’s the thing — my parents 

never monitored what my siblings 
and I read, watched, or listened to.

It’s not like my parents didn’t 

care about what I was doing with 
my free time. I could tell you many-
a-tales about chilly Friday nights 
spent doing extra homework at the 
kitchen table under my mother’s 
watchful eye.

However, they thought if I was 

reading a book that there was defi-
nitely nothing to worry about. To 
them, reading a book automatically 
translated to reading something 
educational and helpful. And they 
were right.

Most of the time.
Reading “Howl” by Allen Gins-

berg when I was eleven years old? 
Probably not advisable, but defi-
nitely enriching and formative to 
my future literary interests in the 
Beat Generation.

Reading 
“Much 
Ado 
About 

Nothing” on my own and forming 
an ardent love for Shakespearean 
comedy and the name Beatrice? My 
dad would be hella proud.

But both my parents would prob-

ably be horrified to learn that I had 
once locked myself in my room for 
seven hours the summer I was a 
thirteen-year-old to engross myself 
in a 200-page anthology of Spider-
Man, of all things, cover-to-cover.

The collection of comics, spi-

noffs, and character histories lit-
erally changed my life, and I now 
know more about the Spider-Man 
universe than any normal person 
ever cared to know.

Did you know Venom eventually 

moved to California to become San 
Francisco’s superhero?

But, like many of the things in 

my mom and dad’s brand of parent-

ing, their lack of oversight when it 
comes to my reading material has 
been both a blessing and a curse to 
my life.

Being able to absolutely pum-

mel my friend Amy — a total baller 
at life outside of Trivia Crack — 
because she didn’t know what the 
name of Han Solo’s ship? Definite 
blessing with a much-needed boost 
to my self-esteem.

And it’s the Millennium Fal-

con, if you were curious — but let’s 
be real, who, except Amy, doesn’t 
know “Star Wars?”

Caring way too much about 

things that no one but myself gives 
a shit about? A curse I wouldn’t 
wish upon my worst enemy. That is, 
if mortal enemies actually existed 
outside of movies and TV shows.

Marvel Studios and Sony Pic-

tures announced last week that they 
would be collaborating to include 
Spider-Man in the new Avengers 
movie. And I (figuratively) died.

But as usual, I was the only one 

in the general vicinity that cared. 
It can definitely be disappointing 
when you excitedly turn to your 
roommate to share this news only 
to get the following reply:

“Okay … I thought they already 

made that movie? With that guy 
from the Social Network?”

It’s a lonely road, but then I 

remind myself that no one has to 
share my weird obsession with Spi-
der-Man.

Because, at the end of the day, I’ll 

still crush my roommate in Trivia 
Crack.

Could Snyder seek the Oval Office?

By Katie Burke, Daily Staff Reporter
A 

self-described nerd, Rick Snyder is more of an execu-
tive than a politician.

After spending most of his career in the private sec-

tor, he made the jump to the governor’s mansion in 2010 and 
has since garnered national attention for his policy decisions. 
As the country prepares for the 2016 presidential elections, 
pundits statewide and across the country have been tossing 
around the question — will “the nerd” make the transition 
from Lansing to Washington?

“Well, I don’t believe in playing traditional politics,” Snyder 

said in his 2015 State of the State address. “I’m not a career 
politician.”

Snyder’s name has appeared on speculative lists of poten-

tial candidates for the 2016 presidential race alongside other 
Midwest governors, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, 
Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

“There is a good deal of interest in the national media in 

governors as opposed to some of the establishment like (for-
mer Florida Governor Jeb) Bush and (former Massachusetts 
Governor Mitt) Romney,” said political syndicated columnist 
George Weeks, a member of the Michigan Journalism Hall of 
Fame.

In a Congress that has become infamous for gridlock and 

partisanship, the outside perspective a governor can provide 
is a major strength for potential candidates.

“You look at the people we have leading Washington, and 

how much they bicker and fight — it would be nice to have 
someone who hasn’t grown up in that culture and isn’t used to 
that way of doing things,” said Law School student John Lin, 
who has served as Snyder’s assistant to the campaign manag-
er, personal aide and assistant director of scheduling.

While Snyder has the advantage of being a fresh face in 

D.C., if he were to run, he would be facing considerable com-
petition from other governors, should they also decide to run.

Susan Demas, a political columnist for MLive.com, said in 

the field of GOP governors in the Midwest — namely Walker, 
Kasich, and Pence — Snyder, due to his “aversion to really get-
ting in the mix with politics” would be “fourth out of four.”

While there has been mounting evidence Snyder is plan-

ning to stay in Michigan — Snyder and his wife bought a $2 
million condominium in downtown Ann Arbor — he has yet 
to formally discount a presidential run. In an election that has 
already generated much speculation from both parties, Sny-
der’s presence on the list of possible Republican candidates 
turns the spotlight on his credentials and record in Michigan.

An unlikely candidate

A University alum — he received an undergraduate degree 

in 1977, an MBA in 1979 and a law degree in 1982 — Snyder’s 
original career path led in the opposite direction of politics.

“I’m a CPA by training,” Snyder said.
He worked as a tax accountant at Detroit firm Coopers & 

Lybrand, making partner in just six years. Snyder then moved 
to Chicago and, after meeting the co-founder of Gateway 
Computers, became executive vice president, then CEO. In 
1997 he returned to Michigan to start a venture capital firm.

In an interview with Lansing news channel WLNS, Snyder 

said the idea to run for governor first came up on a date with 
his wife, where she suggested he run for office after he listed 
off his solutions for the state’s many problems.

In 2010, Snyder, who had never held a political office in his 

life, ran against Lansing mayor and Democratic candidate 

Virg Bernero for the Michigan governorship. Running a cam-
paign that branded him as “one tough nerd,” Snyder beat Ber-
nero by 18 points.

Public Policy lecturer John Hieftje, former mayor of Ann 

Arbor, said he knew Snyder before he became governor. Hief-
tje said Snyder had continued to be accessible even after he 
assumed office.

In terms of his future career aspirations: “He certainly 

could go back into business,” Hieftje said. “He could be in the 
(U.S.) Cabinet. As far as I know, I’m taking the Governor on 
what he says now, which is to be governor.”

Relentless positive action

Since taking office in January 2011, Snyder has operated 

under the motto of “relentless positive action.”

“It’s about being 

positive in the way 
you conduct your-
self, it’s about being 
relentless at solving 
problems,” Lin said. 
“No blame; no taking 
credit. It’s just get-
ting things done and 
getting results.”

In his State of 

the State address in 
January, the gover-
nor 
discussed 
the 

improvements 
in 

state industries that 
occurred 
during 

his first term. Spe-
cifically, he pointed 
to an increase of 
30,000 new jobs in 
the private sector, a 
40-percent decrease 
in the unemployment 
rate and $2 million 
increase in tourism 
revenue.

“We have made the old unbelievable, achievable, and 

we have taken on many difficult issues,” Snyder said in the 
speech. “We’re better, but to be open with you better is not 
good enough. We need to do more.”

As well as improving aspects of the statewide economy, 

Snyder made the Detroit bankruptcy a primary focus of his 
first term. On June 2014, he authorized $195 million from the 
state of Michigan in addition to $366 million from foundations 
and $100 million from the Detroit Institute of Arts in a “grand 
bargain” to lift the city out of bankruptcy. The deal replaced 
cuts in city pensions and avoided the possibility of selling 
DIA-owned works.

“His record in Detroit and what he did there has been 

widely hailed and has gotten a lot of favorable press coverage 
beyond Michigan,” Weeks said. “It’s certainly a strong point 
for him.”

Snyder’s efforts have extended beyond national borders, 

forming global relationships to benefit the state. He traveled 
to China each year of his first term to work with Chinese com-
panies to expand business in Michigan.

In March 2012 and again in March 2014, Snyder met with 

auto manufacturers and suppliers in Europe to bring their 
business to the state auto industry.

And, according to the Detroit Chamber of Commerce, his 

efforts paid off. In 2013, Michigan more than doubled its auto 
production in 2009, moving from about 1.1 million vehicles 
produced to almost 2.5 million, and created about 11,000 jobs 
in the automotive sector.

“Anyone that has seen his results should want to have that 

person leading the country,” Lin said.

Walking the party line

While Snyder’s résumé demonstrates his ability to enact 

positive change at the state level, his policy decisions haven’t 
always lined up with the national Republican party, which 

would prove difficult 
in a presidential pri-
mary.

“His prospects in 

the Republican party 
are relatively limited,” 
said Political Science 
Prof. Mike Traugott. 
“He’s not conservative 
enough.”

In September 2013, 

Snyder made Michi-
gan one of three states 
in which Republicans 
hold the governorship 
and both legislative 
chambers that have 
approved the expan-
sion of Medicaid as a 
part of the Affordable 
Care Act. In doing so, 
Michigan 
receives 

federal 
funding 
to 

extend Medicaid ben-
efits to residents under 
the age of sixty-five 
that are up to 133 per-

cent of the federal poverty level.

Unlike many of his GOP colleagues in Washington, Snyder 

has been aggressive on immigration. In his 2014 State of the 
State address, he urged the U.S. government to allocate 50,000 
visas to skilled workers to immigrate to Detroit.

“There’s no doubt that highly skilled, legal immigrants with 

advanced academic degrees and entrepreneurial talents cre-
ate jobs for Americans,” Snyder said in a statement before his 
2014 speech.

Most recently, Snyder released a statement in early Febru-

ary declining to appeal the 300 same-sex marriages that were 
performed before Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette 
issued a stay on the decision to strike down the state ban on 
gay marriage. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments 
later this year on the legality of same-sex marriage.

Not all of Snyder’s decisions have been moderate, and on 

some issues, including domestic partner benefits and union 
membership, he has taken a strong conservative stand.

“Snyder has done a lot of things to please conservatives,” 

Demas said, citing the 2012 passage of the Right to Work law 

and business tax cuts. “He has gotten a lot of respect for that.”

Another hurdle Snyder would face as a presidential pros-

pect is the political leaning of his own state. Though Michi-
gan’s statewide elections have traditionally trended red 
— both houses have been dominated by Republicans since 
2010, excluding the state Senate from 2007 to 2010 — it has 
voted Democrat in every presidential election since 1992.

Even Romney, a Bloomfield Hills native whose father, 

George Romney, was Governor of Michigan, couldn’t carry 
the state in 2012.

“I don’t see that Michigan is suddenly going to go Republi-

can after six straight presidential elections voting for Demo-
crats,” Demas said. “Especially after how Romney did.”

In the most recent statewide midterm elections, Snyder 

achieved reelection by four points — after outspending his 
opponent, Mark Schauer, by more than $1 million between 
Sept. 13 and Oct. 19.

Despite the close reelection and the state’s voting history, 

the possibility of carrying Michigan cannot be completely dis-
counted.

“The native son thing would definitely play in his favor,” Lin 

said. “(Michigan) is more purple than (it is) blue, so I think he 
has a good chance.”

Washington bound?

Despite media speculation, the oval office isn’t the only 

place in Washington where Snyder’s skills could be put to use.

“The more serious talk would be in terms of a vice presiden-

tial role, though his wife has been very clearly not interested,” 
Demas said. “He’s a strong candidate for the Department of 
Treasury.”

Traugott said the low possibility of Snyder swaying Michi-

gan red would put him on the bottom of the list of potential 
vice presidential candidates, but said he also saw a possibility 
of a U.S. Treasury Department appointment.

While Lin said Treasury or the U.S. Commerce Department 

may not be the best fit for the governor’s skill set, he said he 
believes Snyder would be a prominent addition to the Cabinet.

“I think he’d make a great Cabinet secretary,” Lin said. 

“He’d make a great trade representative given his knowledge 
of working with other countries.”

Weeks, citing past Michigan governors Soapy Williams and 

George Romney, said Snyder could be a candidate to serve in 
any Republican administration.

“If he ends up supporting or endorsing a particular can-

didate who ends up as president, that’s always a possibility,” 
Weeks said.

A Snyder presidential campaign has not officially been put 

out of the question, but it would face considerable obstacles. 
However, the fact that the Governor’s name is being discussed 
has statewide benefits.

“When CNN mentions Rick Snyder, they always mention 

the bankruptcy, taking Detroit out of bankruptcy, our low 
unemployment rate, the fact people are now moving to Michi-
gan,” Lin said. “Four or five years ago, talk about Michigan, 
everyone thinks it’s the worst state to be, but now because 
of the changed narrative, people are now thinking positive 
thoughts about Michigan.

“There’s no reason to stop it.”

New app connects students with friends to 

promote campus safety

by Taylor Wizner, Daily Staff Reporter

T

here’s a new Blue Light emergency phone on cam-
pus, and it’s in your pocket.

Two University students have created a mobile 

app that allows students to stay safe while they travel alone 
around campus. The app, Companion, tracks the user in real 
time, estimating the period of travel needed to get to their 
destination and checking up on them if they fail to make it 
there.

Informatics senior Nathan Pilcowitz and Business senior 

Danny Freed worked together to develop the app. The idea 
for Companion came to them while they were both work-
ing in Chicago over the summer and looking for an app that 
would really have an impact on campus.

“On college campuses — because it’s a smaller area — 

you walk everywhere for the most part,” Freed said. “It’s 
become a bigger societal issue with (the prevalence of) sex-
ual assault violence on campus.”

Companion has some features akin to apps like Google 

Maps and Snapchat. The screen shows a map of the user’s 
location, indicated by a blue dot. The user can press a point 
on the map or type in the address to create their route.

Next, from their contacts, the user adds a “companion,” 

who receives notifications via text message regardless of 
whether they have a phone with the app. The companions 
are automatically prompted to check in with their friend 
if the user doesn’t reach their destination by the predicted 
arrival time.

As the user walks, the screen functions as a security 

interface — if he or she feels unsafe, the app can be used to 
“ping” friends or even call 911.

Freed said the main purpose of the app is to make people 

feel protected with help only a touch away.

“(An assault) might not happen 99 out of 100 times, but 

the fact of the matter is you provide peace of mind,” Freed 
said, of what the app provides its users.

The seniors are working on updating the app to be able to 

interface with the University Police Department. The goal is 
to integrate predictive patrolling, which would allow police 

officers to watch areas where most students are walking 
alone.

“The more people using it, the better the monitoring 

system will get, the more data there is to keep them safer,” 
Freed said.

Prior to downloading Companion, LSA senior Hailey 

Lefkofsky walked home from the library at night with her 
iPhone glued to her ear and carrying pepper spray as a pre-
caution. But she said she never had a consistent and reliable 
safety system.

“I usually called a friend, but a lot of times needed to call 

a few different people until someone was free to stay on 
the phone,” Lefkofsky said. “Otherwise I’d arrange to text 
someone when I got back but often times I’d forget and they 
didn’t hear from me.”

Stressed from crime reports of students being assaulted 

in recent years, Lefkofsky said the app’s instant response 
features came as a relief.

“The campus alerts that we get, a lot of times you get that 

the next day, but if I was walking down that same street 
where there was an attack at 1:00 a.m. that’s something I 
kind of want to know more immediately,” Lefkofsky said. “I 
like that (Companion) is really instantaneous and you can 
ping a friend or you can just call the police directly.”

“This makes me feel 100 times safer and I didn’t really 

have an alternative,” she added.

Lefkofsky said she has tried University-sponsored safety 

measures — like SafeRide and the Blue Light Emergency 
Phones — to help her get places at night, but found them dif-
ficult to use.

“I remember hearing (about SafeRide) at freshman orien-

tation and thinking that was awesome, and then going to use 
and it and being told I had an hour long wait,” she said. “Or 
you could only use it twice a semester. I don’t think its really 
helping the problem.”

Public Policy senior Max Kepes uses the app on week-

nights when he stays too late on campus working. He likes 
the app for its simplicity.

“This (app’s) much more efficient than having to stay on 

the phone with someone (and make) small talk for 15 min-
utes,” Kepes said. “You are able to walk home and alert your 
friends. It’s nice for (my girlfriend) to share her location 
when she’s walking home and for me to share mine just to 
make sure the other person’s home safely.”

Given the app’s ability to track an individual’s location, 

concerns have been raised over personal privacy. But the 
founders said the visibility of the user’s location and user 
information all depends on what the user chooses to share.

“They chose who is going to be their companion,” Pilcow-

itz said. “…And the police, they only would see points of data, 
they can’t tell who you are until you say you are in trouble.”

The app also does not automatically select the same com-

panion each trip, allowing for the user to change who they 
want to keep an eye on them, depending on where they are 
going.

While Kepes said he doesn’t feel unsafe on campus, he 

still likes to use the app as a precaution.

“If there is something that happens, it has the ability to 

notify someone quickly, and I think that is very comforting, 
despite already feeling safe on campus,” Kepes said.

Kepes is also looking forward to the app’s upcoming pre-

dictive patrolling feature.

“I think (UMPD) do a great job but there’s always room for 

improvement,” Kepes said. “Instead of having a safety offi-
cer on State Street, say there’s a concentration (of students 
feeling unsafe) near Hill Street or near (Shapiro Library) on 
South U, it would be a little more efficient.”

When the weather is cold it becomes harder for students 

to speak on the phone, so being able to have the app active in 
your coat pocket is an added plus, Kepes noted.

“I leave the library, I put in my location and put it in my 

pocket, get home and turn it off,” Kepes said. “It’s so simple 
and it doesn’t take any extra time to make sure you’re safe. 
The benefits are really worth it.”

Companion is free in Apple’s App Store and is currently 

being developed for Android devices.

Personal Statement: Disappointment

by Michael Sugerman, Daily News Editor

I

t’s 2:50 a.m., and I’m sitting in front of my computer. To 
my right sits an empty bag of nacho cheese Doritos and a 
bottle of diet Mountain Dew. I have a novel to start and 

finish reading in the next eight hours. It’s go time.

Nights like these aren’t entirely irregular for many college 

students — running off fumes from the pre-packaged rocket 
fuel dispensed from vending machines, rushing to finish 
neglected schoolwork last minute.

I’m going to be honest: I hate that we live this way. And I 

say “we” because I know I’m not alone.

One glance at Yik-Yak is enough to tell me that I’m not the 

only one who procrastinates; I’m not the only one who feels 
lonely sometimes; I’m not the only one without a clue as to 
what I want to do “when I grow up”; and I’m certainly not the 
only one who is becoming increasingly aware how quickly 
time goes by and how little control I have over it all.

____________________

During the Fall 2014 semester, I took Political Science 315: 

Media and Public Opinion. The class was a crash course in 
understanding the psychology behind media persuasion, 
specifically through the lens of political campaigns.

One of the biggest topics of the course was this idea of 

“mortality salience.” Mortality salience is, essentially, the 
knowledge that one day, we are all going to die.

In the political sphere, this manifests itself in how we 

choose our leaders: because we’re doomed to death, while 
we’re alive, we look to the people who are going to keep us 
safest for guidance.

I understood the term’s application in the context of our 

course. But it resonated with me because for a while now, 
I’ve felt that time is going by faster and faster, and as a result, 
my mortality salience has skyrocketed.

All of this, I think, is just a part of growing up. And that’s 

what I really, really fear — that the older I get, the faster time 
will speed by. And that sensation isn’t helped by junk food-
powered all-nighters that seem to make each day blend into 
one murky continuum, in which there is no time to pause and 
simply take it all in.

The astronomy class I’m in right now has also made me 

realize just how insignificant this all is. We live on a planet 
hurtling around a star, and that star is one of billions of stars 
hurtling through the galaxy, and the Milky Way is one of bil-
lions of galaxies in a universe that is slowly expanding every 
day. Relative to everything there is, we are equivalent to a 
fraction of a grain of sand.

If we’re so insignificant, and one day each of us is des-

tined to simply … cease … then what’s the point? I guess I’m 
just a little bit sad, that’s all. Or rather, I feel really over-
whelmed.

Overwhelmed by the day-to-day stuff that seems so 

important — grades and internship applications — and over-
whelmed by how unimportant some of it is in the long run.

I realize that the most important thing is to recognize 

that, because time is limited, we must make the most out of 
every day. But therein lies another problem: I recently con-
sidered the idea that I haven’t been putting my all into every-
thing I do.

In my first semester of college, I was a straight-A student. 

I was confident in my academic abilities. The full effort? It 
wasn’t there, but it didn’t need to be. I was cruising, and cruis-
ing felt good. I was writing for the newspaper, and that felt 
good. I was struggling socially, but talking to my high school 
friends on a regular basis was a remedy for that. Eventually, 
that struggle disappeared. Everything was, overall, okay.

But things aren’t as “okay” now. The more courses I’ve 

taken, the more I’ve become aware of the fact that I don’t 
know exactly what I’m passionate about. And because I don’t 
know what I’m passionate about yet, I worry that I’m wasting 
my time in some classes where the fire hasn’t been ignited. 
That’s a terrible feeling, and subsequently, I try to avoid it.

The hardest part is, this whole college thing — I’m sup-

posed to make some kind of return off the investment, right? 
And the investment is so much more than prioritizing the 
newspaper over class, surfing the Internet for hours and hid-
ing behind the façade that I don’t have enough time for the 
homework. The reality is that I’m just not making time for it 
because I don’t know what I want and that scares me.

____________________

I was an anxious kid. I’d get restless, panicked and even 

nauseated just by sitting in the same place for too long. I was 
also very idealistic: I had a vision for how the world should 
work, and when people failed to meet my expectations, I very 
easily became disappointed and frustrated. It wasn’t fair, 
but when people didn’t agree with me, I saw it as a personal 
affront.

So when, as an undersized fifth grader, pamphlets were 

presented to me in class about the dangers of drugs and 
alcohol, they really got to me. I went home crying that day, 
worried that there were substances that could impair my 
judgment and risk my safety.

I was doubly appalled that, in the vague but not-too-dis-

tant future, at least a handful of my friends would apparently 
be doomed to use these “scary” substances — and would sub-
sequently pressure me to join them.

My heart would beat faster even when my parents had 

even one glass of wine at home — I didn’t want them to get 
drunk. Even after they explained to me that alcohol con-
sumption is nuanced, and responsible adults know not to 
drink in excess, it took a while to sink in.

By high school, little had changed. Some of my friends 

began drinking and smoking, and I was not subtle in my dis-
approval. I avoided weekend parties at all costs, because A: I 
feared that I’d be unwittingly presented with substances, and 
B: I worried that I’d be too uncomfortable to enjoy myself.

When I got to college, part B held true. During Welcome 

Week of my freshman year, I found myself in the basement 
of a fraternity house. I hadn’t wanted to go, but a friend had 
suggested it and I figured that if college was about getting 
out of one’s comfort zone, I might as well give it a try.

After telling the drunk student manning the door that my 

friend Joe and I were “definitely going to rush” in order to 
gain entry, I stepped into a nightmare. The house was dimly 
lit by colored strobe lights. It reeked of marijuana and ciga-
rettes. The floor was wet with spilled beer and cheap vodka. 
Red Solo Cups lined fold-out tables in the foyer, along with 
half-consumed handles of liquor and chaser.

I couldn’t hear my friend above the music, which was 

so loud that I could feel the bass reverberating through my 
body. There were so many people packed into the home that 
there was little to no room to move. It was very humid. Less 
than 10 minutes after arriving, I left.

I got drunk for the first time at a friend’s house toward the 

end of my first semester, sharing a case of Hamm’s beer — 
the cheapest and crappiest we could find — with three other 
guys. I had decided that if drinking was part of the process of 
becoming a college student, I was going to do it with a small 
group of people in a comfortable, contained setting. Here’s 
what shocked me: I liked the buzz. I liked how it felt. And 
liking it made me feel guilty.

____________________

We come into college believing that it’s where we’re going 

to find ourselves, make our closest friends, and have this 
epiphany where we realize our higher calling and pursue it 
with gusto. On top of that, I personally came to college with 
naïve notions about the “evils” of drinking and fears about 
other substances that I’ve since tried.

So far, I’ve found that the idealistic, picture-perfect ver-

sion of things doesn’t hold true. That’s what really gets to 
me. Because right now, the 10-year-old version of myself who 
wanted to be an author (or a professional baseball player) and 
thought that he’d never touch an alcoholic beverage is kind of 
disappointed in me. I get that it’s not rational, but I still feel 
that disappointment, and I’m deeply conflicted by it.

The point here, going back to the beginning, is that I know 

I’m not alone. And I just wish people would talk about this 
more, beyond the confines of an anonymous mobile social 
media application. It’s the same logic behind the reason I 
love listening to melancholy Jackson Brown ballads when 
I’m feeling down: I’m comforted by the fact that someone 
else has, at one time or another, shared whatever pain I feel.

We need to be more honest — the world isn’t always 

everything it’s talked up to be, but that’s okay. Frequently I 
feel shackled by either fear of what the future holds or my 
childhood idealism. But I’ve learned it’s about being in the 
moment. I just don’t want that moment to end.

8B

Last November, I had the 

opportunity to photograph Norm 
Holtz, a farmer from Ida, Mich. I 
met Norm at Detroit’s Eastern 
Market, where he’s been selling 
produce since 1968. His hands 
were still dirty from that morn-
ing’s work on sixty acres of farm-
land that have belonged to his 
family since the late 19th century. 
Born and raised in Ida, he started 
working on the farm while in high 
school. Norm hasn’t stopped 
since and has no plans to retire 
any time soon.
