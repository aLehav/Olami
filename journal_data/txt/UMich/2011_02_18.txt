STATE BUDGET
Snyder cuts
higher ed.
funding by
15 percent

*University President Mary Sse Coleman speaks daring a Bnard at Regents meeting in the Fleming Administration Building yesterday.
Med Shol faulty show
support for tenure change

Officials to look
at how decrease
could affect 'U'-
operations
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily News Editor
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
announced his proposed budget
for the 2012 fiscal year in Lansing
yesterday, outlining substantial
cuts in government spending,
including a 15-percent decrease
in higher education funding.
After hearing word of the
proposed decrease in funds for
higher education, University offi-
cials said they had expected cuts
and will take them into account
when planning the University's
budget. Democratic legislators
also expressed disappointment
yesterday in the possibility of the
reduction in state allocations to
Michigan colleges and universi-
ties.
Snyder's proposed 15-percent
reduction is more than five times
greater than the 2.8-percent cut
in state appropriations for public

universities in the 2411fiscal year.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman said in an interview
after the University's Boa'rd of
Regents meeting yesterday that
University officials had been
expecting another cut to higher
education funding in the upcom-
ing fiscal year and are now in the
process of determining how this
will impact the University.
"We didn't know what to
expect actually, but we knew,
just looking at the revenues of the
state, that things were going to be
tough, of course," Coleman said.
"I'm all for investing in our edu-
cation because I think it is the key
to the future, but we haven't had
time to analyze (the cuts) yet."
University Provost Philip Han-
lon echoed Coleman's statements
and said University administra-
tors had been monitoring the
state budget in anticipation of
cuts to higher education funding.
Despite Michigan's challenged
economic environment, the Uni-
versity will continue to work
toward sustaining University
operations, Hanlon said.
"We've been watching the
state budget closely for a number

At regents meeting,
several push for
longer tenure clock
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
At the University's Board of
Regents meeting yesterday, Uni-
versity Medical School faculty
voiced concerns about the need
for a more flexible tenure clock,
asking for a maximum 10-year

probationary period.
Established in 1944, the Uni-
versity's current tenure pro-
gram, as stated in the regents'
bylaw 5.09, allows for up to an
eight-year probationary period,
including one terminal year. The
proposed changes will add two
more probationary years to the
tenure program.
Several years ago, an advisory
board that reports to the Uni-
versity provost proposed to alter
the tenure probationary period.
During a Jan. 24 Senate Assem-

bly meeting, University Provost
Philip Hanlon introduced the
idea to the assembly members.
In an interview before the
Jan. 24 meeting, Hanlon said
the proposed change would be
an option for the various schools
and colleges at the University,
rather than an enforced change.
He said the lengthened period
wouldn't extend the require-
ments needed to become ten-
ured, but could increase the
time faculty members have to
make their case.

During the January Senate
Assembly meeting, members of
the University's leading faculty
government body voiced their
displeasure with the proposal
to extend the maximum tenure
probationary period.
Among their concerns were
worries that an increased pro-
bationary period would result in
too much of a time commitment
to the University that couldn't
be redeemed if the Univer-
sity refused the faculty tenure

At the University's Board
of Regents meeting yesterday,
graduate student instructors
and graduate student research
assistants spoke about the need
for University administrators

to recognize issues that impact
the two groups.
During the public comments
segment of the meeting, mem-
bers of the Graduate Employ-
ees' Organization addressed
several issues, including eco-
nomic distress amonggraduate
students and issues affecting
disabled graduate students.
This year marks the begin-
ning of GEO's new negotiation
cycle, which takes place every
three years.
In light of the negotiations,

Interim GEO Vice President
Chelsea Del Rio stressed the
need for GSIs to assert control
in their work environments.
Del Rio gave examples of
GSIs who were asked to grade
papers during unsafe weather
conditions and others whose
health plans didn't cover physi-
cal therapy.
She emphasized that GSIs
play an integral role at the Uni-
versity.

By SARAH ALSADEN
Daily StaffReporter
After Lambda Chi Alpha fra-
ternity's house dog Yikes was
injured, support from friends of

the fraternity and members of the
University community flooded in
to help finance Yikes's necessary
surgery. However, the efforts
have drawn negative attention
fromthe Humane Society.
The Humane Society of Huron
Valley has pursued an investiga-
tion into Yikes's living situation
since the organization found
out about his injury. In addition,
Engineering junior Gabe John-

son, who is Yikes's official owner
and the house manager of the
fraternity located on Washtenaw

the fraternity's international
organization for having Yikes in
the house.

One U.S. agent dead after
Mexican drug gang ambush

a

Homeland Security
official calls attack
a 'game changer'
BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP)
- Gunmen from Mexico's ruth-
less Zetas drug gang carried out
a highway ambush that killed one
U.S. federal agent and wounded
another this week, a Texas con-
gressman said yesterday.
Michael McCaul said Immi-
gration and Customs Enforce-
ment Special Agent Jaime Zapata,
32, was killed by members of the
Zeta cartel after a group of 10 to
15 armed men in two vehicles
forced Zapata's Chevy Suburban
off a highway in San Luis Potosi
state on Tuesday afternoon. ICE
Agent Victor Avila was shot twice
in the leg.
McCaul is chairman of the
House Homeland Security Over-
sight and Investigations Subcom-
mittee and was briefed on the
attack by intelligence sources
as part of his position. He said
the agents, both of whom were
assigned to Texas but on tempo-
rary assignment in Mexico, identi-
fied themselves as U.S. diplomats
before being shot, "hoping they
(the Zetas) would honor the long-
standing tradition that they don't
(target) U.S. law enforcement."
"This was a complete ambush,"
said the Texas Republican, who
said investigators recovered least
90 bullet casings from the scene.
"This is a complete game
changer," McCaul said. "They are

changing the rules."
He said that while the motive
for the attack remains unclear,
one thing is certain: "There's no
case of mistaken identity."
Authorities have said the
agents were likely in the wrong
place at the wrong time and that
their SUV is of a kind coveted by
drug cartels in the area.
San Luis Potosi borders two
northern Mexican states where
the Zetas and the rival Gulf Cartel
have waged bloody battles over
territory. Zapata and Avila were
temporarily detailed to the ICE
attache office in Mexico City and
were driving from the northern
city of Monterrey to the Mexican
capital at the time of the attack.
Mexican authorities are inves-
tigating the shooting but have not
announced any arrests.
"My sense is that we know, we
probably have pretty good intel-
ligence as to who was behind'
this," McCaul said. "That's what
it appears to be."
U.S. Homeland Security Secre-
tary Janet Napolitano and Attor-
ney General Eric Holder have
formed a joint task force led by
the FBI to help Mexico find the
killers.
Holder said yesterday that U.S.
officials would look closely at the
security situation in Mexico and
make any changes warranted to
ensure that U.S. personnel "have
maximum protection."
The Mexican government
does not allow U.S. law enforce-
ment personnel operating in
its territory to carry weapons.

Holder said the U.S. government
will examine whether American
agents in Mexico need to carry
guns or other safeguards need
to be instituted in light of the
shootings.
"We will look at this and we'll
do ... an analysis of what it is that
we need to do to make sure that
everybody is as safe down there
as we can make them," he said.
McCaul said he wants to move
more aggressively.
"We are helping them, they
are not helping us," McCaul said.
"If we are going to put our guys
down there ... to allow them not
to be armed really puts them right
in the bulls-eye and they are sit-
ting targets."
McCaul also said he wants to
schedule congressional hearings
to examine the U.S. role in Mex-
ico's ongoing drug war, which has
killed more than 35,000 people
since Mexican President Felipe
Calderon launched an offensive
against the country's drug gangs
shortly after taking office in
December 2006.
Avila serves on a unit to deter
human trafficking and is based in
El Paso, Texas.
Zapata, a native of Brownsville,
had been based out of Laredo,
Texas. He joined Homeland Secu-
rity in 2006, served on the Human
Smuggling and Trafficking Unit as
well as the Border Enforcement
Security Task Force. He also for-
merly was a member of the U.S.
Border Patrol in Yuma, Ariz.
Yesterday, police and ICE offi-
cers barred access to Zapata's
mother's home in this border city
across the Rio Grande from Mat-
amoros, Mexico, using cruisers,
motorcycles and blue-and-white
ICE truck to block access to a pri-
vate road, which forked off a two-
lane parkway lined with tall, thin
palm trees and unassuming, one-
story homes.
Brownsville police spokesman
Eddie Garcia said the department
doesn't usually provide such pro-
tection to the family of shooting
victims but that it was appropri-
ate given the circumstances.

Pro-Gadhafi supporters wave his posters during a march supporting leader Moammar Gadhafi in Tripoli, Libya, yester-
day. Libyan protesters seeking to oust Gadhafi also took to the streets in four cities on the "day of rage."

Libyan leader
targeted in protests
across five cities
CAIRO (AP) - Libyan pro-
testers seeking to oust longtime
leader Moammar Gadhafi defied
a crackdown and took to the
streets in five cities yesterday
on what activists have dubbed
a "day of rage," amid reports
at least 20 demonstrators have
been killed in clashes with pro-
government groups.
New York-based Human
Rights Watch said Libyan inter-
nal security forces also have
arrested at least 14 people. Hun-
dreds of pro-government dem-
onstrators also rallied in the
capital, Tripoli, blocking traffic
in some areas, witnesses said.
An opposition website and
an anti-Gadhafi activist said
unrest broke out during marches
in four Libyan cities - Beyida,
Benghazi, Zentan, Rijban and
Darnah. Organizers were using
social networking sites like
Facebook and Twitter to call for
nationwide demonstrations.
"Today the Libyans broke the
barrier or fear, it is a new dawn,"
said Faiz Jibril, an opposition
leader in exile.
Opposition website Libya Al-
Youm said four protesters were
slain by snipers from the Inter-

nal Security Forces in the east-
ern city of Beyida, which had
protests Wednesday and yester-
day. It's not clear when the pro-
testers were killed. The website
also said there was a demon-
stration yesterday in Benghazi,
Libya's second-largest city, and
that security forces had shot
and killed six people with live
ammunition.
Switzerland-based Libyan
activist Fathi al-Warfali said 11
protesters were killed in Beyida
on Wednesday night, and scores
were wounded. He said the gov-
ernment dispatched army com-
mandos to quell the uprising.
Libya Al-Youm said that pro-
testers set out yesterday after
the funeral for those killed a day
earlier toward the State Secu-
rity building, chanting "Free
Libya, Gadhafi get out!"
Mohammed Ali Abdellah,
deputy leader of the exiled
National Front for the Salva-
tion of Libya, said that hospitals
in Beyida were complaining of
a shortage in medical supplies,
and that the government has
refused to provide them to treat
an increasing number of pro-
testers.
Abdellah quoted hospital
officials in the town as say-
ing that about 70 people have
been admitted since Wednes-
day night, about half of them
critically injured by gunshot

wounds.
Gadhafi's government has
moved quickly to try to stop
Libyans from joining the wave
of uprisings in the Middle East
that have ousted the leaders of
Egypt and Tunisia. It has pro-
posed the doubling of govern-
ment employees' salaries and
released 110 suspected Islamic
militants who oppose him -
tactics similar to those adopted
by other Arab regimes facing
recent mass protests.
An autocrat who has ruled
for more than 40 years, Gadhafi
also has been meeting with trib-
al leaders to solicit their sup-
port. State television reported
Tuesday that Gadhafi spoke
with representatives of the Ben
Ali tribe, one of Libya's biggest
clans and one that has branches
into neighboring Egypt.
Tripoli residents said they
were having trouble accessing the
Internet, although it was not clear
whether access had been blocked
or the bandwidth reduced. At the
height of the protests in Egypt
last month, the government shut
down the Internet for five days in
a bid to curb the protesters' abil-
ity to organize.
The official news agency
JANA said yesterday's pro-gov-
ernment rallies were intended
to express "eternal unity with
the brother leader of the revolu-
tion." as Gadhafi is known.

DETROIT
Podiatrist, health
care providers
accused of fraud
Federal prosecutors in Detroit
have filed a fresh batch of fraud
charges against health-care pro-
viders, including a podiatrist
accused of billing Medicare for
$700,000 in toenail treatments
that weren't provided.
At least 20 people were indicted
in a variety of alleged schemes
to milk millions of dollars from
Medicare. Most defendants ran
clinics or offered home health
care in the Detroit area and are
accused of billing the government
for bogus services.
Errol Sherman is a podiatrist
in Oak Park. The government said
yesterday that he committed fraud
for at least four years. Sherman
and his attorney declined to com-
ment after they appeared in court.
U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade
and Andrew Arena, the head of the
FBI in Detroit, planned to speak to
reporters about the cases.

last March.
The $7.4 million worth of new

Latino population
New U.S. Census figures show
that ethnic minorities account
for 89 percent of the growth in
Texas, which is poised to gain
four new congressional seats -
twice as many as any other state.
The numbers released yester-
day confirm the explosive growth
among Latinos in Texas. Some
experts project that in the next
decade, there will be more His-
panics living in the Lone Star
state than whites.
Latino politicians say it's time
their demographic strength
translated into political power.
Democratic state Rep. Robert

gressional seats to be dominated

Endangered 6-foot
leatherback turtle
spotted with eggs
Conservationists say they got a
rare glimpse of a 6-foot (2-meter)
-long leatherback - the world's
most endangered sea turtle -
together with dozens of eggs in
western Indonesia.
Khairul Amra, a member of
a local conservation group, said
yesterday that the giant turtle
was spotted on a beach on Suma-
tra island over the weekend just
before it plunged into the water.
Soon after 65 eggs thought to
belong to the leatherback were
found in a nest - the third such
discovery on the same beach this
year.
Leatherbacks, which can grow
up to 9 feet (3 meters) long, have
roamed the oceans for 100 million
years, but the globe-trotting sea
turtles today number only around
30,000.

TENURE
From Page 1
and the possibility that those
deserving tenure wouldn't be
promoted before the probation-
ary period expired.
However, during the public
comments segment of the Board
of Regents meeting yesterday,
several Medical School depart-
ment chairs and faculty mem-,
bers said they think the tenure
clock should be extended to the
10-year plan.
The faculty members men-
tioned delayed funding from the
National Institutes of Health,
lengthy research methods and
personal obstacles - like hav-
ing children or becoming ill -
as reasons to extend the tenure
probationary period for Medical
School professors.
During the meeting, John
Carethers, chair of the Depart-
ment of Internal Medicine at
the Medical School, said the
1944 bylaw doesn't encompass
the changes in today's science
world or reflect the active role of
research.
"Team science is more rel-
evant today than it was in the
past," Carethers said.
Toby Lewis, an assistant
professor in the Department of
Pediatrics and Communicable
Diseases at the Medical School,
pointed to her own research of
childhood asthma within differ-
ent communities. She said this
type of research, which involves
years of gathering data, extends
beyond the University's tenure
clock.
Lewis also said the University
needs to promote faculty who
perform this extensive research
because of its positive effect on
policy and world health.
"I think we should be able to
extend the clock since we have
high-performing faculty that
need a little extra time to get the
work done," Lewis said.
Carol Bradford, chair of the
Department of Otolaryngol-

ogy at the Medical School, said
at yesterday's meeting that the
current tenure plan isn't family
friendly because it doesn't allow
faculty time to care for their
children. She added that women
currently make up 18 percent of
the University's instructional
track of professors at the Medi-
cal School.
"Were it not for a few great
opportunities, mentorship and
lucky breaks, I might not be
standing here before you today,"
Bradford said.
Similarly, Internal Medicine
Prof. Susan Goold said she feels
the tenure track disproportion-
ately affects women. She added
that the extended tenure offers
the opportunity for manipula-
tion of the system, as faculty
could continue teaching with-
out tenure for a longer period
of time in order to keep salaries
lower.
"Some attention should be
paid to that possibility," Goold
said.
In an interview after the
meeting, Hanlon said he will
begin to address the issue of the
possible tenure changes next
week.
"I'm intending to begin the
public comment process next
Monday," Hanlon said.
Also interviewed after the
meeting, University President
Mary Sue Coleman said Han-

White House
calls settlements
'illegitimate'
WASHINGTON (AP) - Stuck
in a diplomatic bind, the Obama
administration scrambled yes-
terday to avert a difficult U.N.
Security Council vote on a Pal-
estinian-backed resolution con-
demning Israeli settlements.
President Barack Obama raised
the subject in a call with Pal-
estinian President Mahmoud
Abbas after other attempts to
sway him failed.
Though Israel's closest ally,
the United States has nonethe-
less opposed new settlements,
saying they are an impediment
to peace between Israel and
the Palestinians. But the U.S.
also does not want the Securi-
ty Council takingup the isse,
arguing it would complicate
peace negotiations.
Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton said that the
Security Council vote planned
Friday would be counterpro-
ductive as the United States
focuses on advancing talks that
will lead to a two-state solution.

"We have consistently over
many years said that the United
Nations Security Council and
resolutions that would come
before the Security Council are
not the right vehicle to advance
that goal," she said at a news
conference after a briefing with
senators.
The vote places the Obama
administration in a predica-
ment. A U.S. veto would place
Obama at odds with the Pales-
tinians and its supporters in the
Arab world; abstaining from
the vote would anger Israelis.
The issue also places Obama
in a political fix at home where
he already faced criticism for
trying to avoid a veto from
Democratic and Republican
supporters of Israel in Con-
gress.
On Wednesday, the U.S.
ambassador to the U.N., Susan
Rice, proposed a weaker Secu-
rity Council presidential
statement instead of a legally
binding resolution, a step that
represented a shift from the
long-held U.S. view that the
Security Council is not the
proper forum to address the
issue of Israeli settlements. Pal-
estinians rejected the offer.

Palestinians object to settle-
ment building in the West Bank
and East Jerusalem, saying it is
the primary obstacle to resum-
ing peace talks with Israel. The
resolution declares that those
settlements "are illegal and
constitute a major obstacle to
the achievement of a just, last-
ing and comprehensive peace."
The administration, howev-
er, has declined to describe the
settlements as "illegal," prefer-
ring "illegitimate" instead.
"We, like every administra-
tion for decades, do not accept
the legitimacy of continued set-
tlement activity," White House
spokesman Jay Carney said yes-
terday. "We believe that con-
tinued expansion is corrosive
not only to peace efforts and a
two-state solution, which we
strongly support, but to Israel's
future itself."
Carney said the best-path.
toward peace was direct nego-
tiations between Israelis and
Palestinians.
Rep. Howard Berman of Cal-
ifornia, the ranking Democrat
on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, urged the Obama'
administration to simply veto
the resolution on settlements.

U.S. faces Iraqi lawsuit

Baghdad demands -
apology, funds to
restore city
BAGHDAD (AP) - The Bagh-
dad city government is demand-
ing the United States pay $1
billion and apologize for damage
to the city caused by blast walls
erected during the nearly eight-
year long war.
City officials filed a lawsuit in
an Iraqi court against the U.S.
military, a media official said
yesterday. He did not want to be
identified due to the sensitivity
of the situation.
In an official statement posted
late Wednesday on its website,
the local government said U.S.

forces had marred the "beauti-
~ctity"
Blast walls "put up at the pre-
text of security" damaged the
sewage system and sidewalks,
caused traffic jams and para-
lyzed business, the statement
read.
City officials want an official
apology and $1 billion to pay for
the damage.
However, Kamil al-Zaidi, the
head of the Baghdad provincial
council said Iraqi security forces
should also share responsibility
for the miles of concrete barriers
that crisscross the capital.
"The Iraqi security bod-
ies, not only the Americans,
bear part of the responsibility
for putting up these walls," he
said.

cated.
Johnson said the Humane
Society has misinterpreted the
cause of Yikes's injury.
"A lot of it is misunderstand-
ings and people jumping to con-
clusions," Johnson said. "(People
were) taking actions without
really understanding the full
story."
Johnson said a representative
fromthe Humane Societyvisited
the fraternity house to assess the
situation.
"They wanted to see if he was
being abused, but after seeing
his condition, and that we were
working toward his cure, and
that he had a good living situa-
tion, everything checked out just
fine," Johnson said.
Matt Schaecher, supervi-
sor of Cruelty and Rescue at the
Humane Society of Huron Valley,
said the society began an investi-
gation, but said he couldn't dis-
close any further information
since it is a pending case.
Yikes's injury most likely
resulted from his ability to open
doors and knobs and let himself
out of the fraternity house, John-
son said.
"Someone found him outside,
limping on his leg," he said. "We
are guessing that he may have
gotten hit by a car, but we're not
sure."
Since the accident, Johnson
said he has purchased an invis-
ible electric fence to ensure Yikes
won't wander into the street
again.
However, according to Tad
Lichtenauer, director of com-
munications for the interna-
tional headquarters of Lambda
Chi Alpha, Yikes shouldn't have
been in the house to begin with
since it is a violation of the
house lease to have pets. The
local chapter hasn't allowed

students to keep pets on the
premises since the internation-
al headquarters purchased the
house in the mid-1980s, he said.
"When we took ownership
of that house, we have had the
stipulation about no pets, per the
lease, because it's a liability for
us," Lichtenauer said.
Because of this violation and
other factors, Johnson has been
put on disciplinary suspension
by the international organiza-
tion, Lichtenauer said.
"Gabe was suspended for a
number of reasons, and only one
of which was violating his lease
with the dog," he said. "He had a
series of violations of the code of
conduct that also led to his sus-
pension."
According to Lichtenauer,
the suspension could be lifted
if Johnson adheres to certain
criteria and appeals to an exec-
utive committee of the local
chapter. Lichtenauer added that
as long as Johnson was in vio-
lation of the lease, he couldn't
continue to live in the house.
"It's (a) violation of our lease to
have a pet in that house, and that
is really as black and white as it
is from our standpoint," he said.
Johnson declined to comment
when asked about his suspen-
sion.
According to Chris Haughee,
assistant director of the Uni-
versity's Office of Greek Life,
the University doesn't own or
maintain any fraternity or soror-
ity housing, so it doesn't have
any restrictions on house pets.
Haughee said he wasn't aware
of any animal rights violations in
the Lambda Chi house.
"Private housing is a private
issue, and we have no position
and no policy on this issue,"
Haughee said.
Schaecher said animal cru-
elty by students isn't a significant
problem on campus, but is still
discussed as an issue.
"Generally we get complaints

of students that have left for the
summer that leave their animals
behind," Schaecher said.
However, Schaecher said the
Humane Society doesn't dis-
suade students from adopting
pets.
"We don't encourage or dis-
courage students," Schaecher
said. "Most of the students are
capable and are responsible
just like anybody else is for the
humane treatment of an animal.
We're not bombarded with com-
plaints about students mistreat-
ing animals. Most of them can
give the animals the adequate
care."
Despite all the controversy,
Johnson said Yikes is taken care
of at the fraternity house.
"At the end of the day, all I
really want to do is help get my
dog fixed without all this politi-
cal garbage," he said.
After taking Yikes to a vet-
erinarian, Johnson said he found
out the cost of surgery for Yikes
would be higher than initial esti-
mates due to a genetic problem
that makes Brittany spaniels
more prone to injury.
To raise the $3,500 for
Yikes's surgery, the Lambda
Chi brothers started a Face-
book group to garner support
and advertise public services
they're offering in order to raise
funds for Yikes's surgery. These
services include serenading
people and allowing fraternity
members' friends to babysit
Yikes for a fee. So far the broth-
ers have raised $2,100.
Though the fraternity hasn't
yet collected enough funds for
Yikes's surgery,. Johnson said he
plans to proceed with the opera-
tion, which will take place on
Wednesday at the Michigan State
University Veterinary School.
"We're going to go ahead and
get the surgery, even though we
haven'traised enough money," he
said. "We'll just set up a payment
plan and continue to raise it."

Snyder is all busin s
Budget proposal focusses on jobs, cuts education
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder unveiled his new budget pro-
posal yesterday, and Michigan residents are in store for big
changes - that are potentially good and bad. Either way,
it's clear that Snyder is fulfilling his promise to shake up business
in Lansing.

Synder's budget announcement was by no
means out of left field. He has been talking
about large-scale changes to Michigan's eco-
nomic system since he began his campaign.
His proposal to eliminate the Michigan Busi-
ness Tax and replace it with a flat 6 percent
corporate income tax, for example, came as
no surprise. And his substantial cuts to gov-
ernment spending were also not a shock.
Even schools were prepared for a reduction
in state funding, but few anticipated a 15 per-
cent cut - Synder's official proposal.
In what came as a huge blow to schools
around the state, it was proposed yesterday
that funding for public schools would be
reduced by $470 per student - $170 of which
had been previously determined - and that
public universities would receive 15 percent
less funding, according to a Feb. 17 Detroit
Free Press article. These cuts have left
schools scrambling to determine how they
will cope with this decrease in state appro-
priations.
It's clear that Snyder's eye is on the future
of Michigan and building the state up to a
competitive level. There's no doubt that Sny-
der's budget decisions weren't made rashly.
The recently inaugurated governor certain-
ly hadhis work cut out for him, after being
handed down astate economy that is $47 bil-
lion in debt. But he seems to have lost sight
that there are people who still need to live
and work in Michigan while he is working to
develop businesses and bring new people to
the state.

Current Michigan students at all educa-
tion levels are going to encounter significant,
and potentially detrimental, changes at their
schools. It's unrealistic to expect schools to
perform at the desired level - a bar that will
potentially be even higher if scores needed to
pass standardized tests are raised - without
the proper resources. It's also unrealistic to
expect Michigan businesses to want to stay
in Michigan if workers can't send their chil-
dren to well-funded schools.
Synder is known to reference Michigan's
"brain drain" problem. And while he may
be working to establish job opportunities
in the state for college graduates, taking
away funding from public universities cre-
ates a problem for students trying to obtain
an education in Michigan. If the state can't
give young people educational opportunities,
then our future will be rather bleak regard-
less of the strength of our economy.
The self-proclaimed "nerd" is also a self-
proclaimed businessman, and in all likeli-
hood his budget proposals will be good for
small businesses. But if you're a student, a
film producer or unemployed, Michigan isn't
going to be an easy place to live in in the com-
ing months. The state hasn't heard the last
of Snyder's budget proposa s, and the Leg-
islature will likely be tieb in debate over
the specifics for weeks. 5 as this budget is
revised, Congress needs to ensure that Mich-
igan's students remain a priority because the
current 15 percent funding cut says the oppo-
site.

Dozens of IBM researchers
spent three years build-
ing one computer for what
appeared to be
one purpose.
Watson, whose .
10 racks of off-
stage servers
pack 13 trillion
bytes of data,
appeared on
television for
three straight MATT
nights this week AARONSON
to compete
on the popu-
lar long-running NBC game show
Jeopardy.
The gender-neutral Watson
faced stiff competition in human
champions Ken Jennings - whose
74-game win streak in 2004 has
yet to be surpassed - and the pre-
viously undefeated Brad Rutter,
who holds the record for monetary
winnings. Yet when all was said
and done, in the "Final Jeopardy"
round of the third and final night,
Jennings quoted "The Simpsons"
to declare in parentheses following
his written answer: "I, for one, wel-
come our new computer overlords."
If you can't beat 'em, he figured,
might as well praise 'em. And nei-
ther Jennings nor Rutter could beat
Watson. Rutter finished the first
night tied with the supercomputer,
and Jennings made a good run early
on in night three. But Watson ran
away with the game, the tourna-
ment and the million-dollar grand
prize (which IBM split evenly
between two charities).,,
Writing for Slate on Wednesday
night, Jennings said it didn't take
long for him to realize that "this
was to be an away game for human-
ity."
Not everyone was impressed.
New York Times television critic
Alessandra Stanley wrote after
Watson's first appearance that "It's
not the match of the century, it's
more like the letdown of a lifetime."
Stanley approached the situation
with such skepticism and casu-
al indifference that we can only

assume she owns a Jetsons-esque
robot to dress and groom her every
morning before she gets into her
flying car that drops her off at the
Times office and parks itself while
she rattles off orders for her interns
using only a chip implanted in her
brain.
Stanley criticized the represen-
tation of Watson by an on-stage
avatar as unfair, wondering why the
human contestants couldn't "con-
sult a backstage ensemble of 2,800
experts," referring to the number
of computers to which Watson's
power can be compared. She con-
cluded that if Watson loses "IBM
should be ashamed: the company
should have gone all out and sprung
for a full 3,000 (computers)."
Perhaps she's right - there are
plenty of reasons that the challenge
wasn't necessarily fair for the prov-
en human champions. But that's
not what makes this event special.
It was an exhibition tournament,
after all.
Putting all preoccupations with
fairness and competitive purity
aside, it's remarkable what this
machine can do. As IBM research-
ers explain in advertisements
promoting the special challenge,
Watson illustrates a breakthrough
in the ability of computers to
understand and interpret human
language, idioms and even tone. At
lightning-fast processing speeds,
it applies these capabilities to a
vast pool of knowledge, and if its
best answer reaches the "confi-
dence threshold," Watson buzzes in
before the humans can wrap their
head around the question (or on
Jeopardy, the answer).
On Monday night, the $1,000
prompt in the category "Final
Frontiers" was as follows: "Tick-
ets aren't needed for this 'event', a
black hole's boundary from which
matter can't escape." Watson, with
97-percent confidence, buzzed in.
"Event horizon," said the robotic
voice.
In Wednesday's "Dialing for Dia-
lects" category, the .$200 prompt
would seem simple for a human but

quite tricky for a computer. "Spre-
chen sie plattdeutch? If you do,
you speak the low variety of this
language." Watson buzzed in right
away: "What is German?"
The "question-answer machine"
even makes informed risk decisions
on the fly. Consider Tuesday night's
Final Jeopardy answer: "Its largest
airport is named for a World War II
hero; its second largest, for a World
War II battle." Watson wrongly
offered Toronto, but saved itself by
taking confidence level into account
and only wagering $947.
Trivia show was
an 'away game
for humanity.
If Watson's capabilities were
truly confined to winning quiz
shows, the project would be a seri-
ous waste of time, effort and money.
The technological advancements
made by the -IBM team represent a
leap, forward in the long-dreamed-
of utility of artificial intelligence.
According to the IBM employees
featured in the specials, the same
natural-language capabilities could
do worlds of good in improving
business logistics and even in help-
ing doctors make faster and better
diagnoses.
"It changes the paradigm in
which we work with computers,"
said one researcher.
But even without such an opti-
mistic outlook, anything'that puts
science and engineering in the fore-
front of conversation - especially
in a country that lags significantly
in education for these areas and
will likely feel the effects of that in
the future - is a good thing. Any-
thing that does it in a fun and stim-
ulating way is even more valuable.

AVERY ROBINSON I
Rethink bottled water ban

MEAGHAN O'CONNOR, ANDREA BYL AND AMANDA USTICK I
'Go Red' for a healthy heart

I am sitting on my couch trying to draft an
e-mail when all of a sudden I am bombarded
with c-mails asking me to sign a petition to
ban bottled water sales on campus. I think
it's a great idea. There is a gross amount of
environmental abuse associated with this
industry, and bottled water is worse for you
than tap water (tap water is almost always
better). Bottled water is regulated by the
Food and Drug Administration, which has
much looser regulations than the Environ-
mental Protection Agency and Safe Drinking
Water Act that regulate tap water. However,
despite the chemical pollutants that may be
found in our bottled water, the health effects,
physical and environmental, of drinking bot-
tied water are not nearly as bad as drinking
pop (read: soda or Coca-Cola for people out-
side the Midwest).
If the argument for banning bottled water
is based purely on bottles being an environ-
mental tribulation, then the same logic applies
equally for pop and other beverages. But the
ban does not mention these items, so there
must be more to the issue than just packaging.
The cost of bottled water is relatively low
- it's just tap water and a cheap plastic bot-
tle. But colas and other pops require the same
amount of water with the addition of high
fructose corn syrup or other "diet" sweeten-
ers, natural and artificial flavors (whatever
those are), coloring, caffeine and who knows
what else. Essentially, take water and com-

pound it by the cost of industrially growing
and refining corn and soy.
By removing bottled water from the
shelves of vending machines and campus
cafes, this ban will push people toward mak-
ing unhealthy consumptive decisions. Stud-
ies have shown that drinking pop and other
non-water refreshments leads to poor health,
a greater risk of heart disease and weight
gain. I know this isn't the intention of this
ban, but you should always think about the
consequences of your actions.
I always carry a water bottle, but is it
reasonable to expect 40,000 students and
30,000 faculty and staff, as well as visitors
to our campus, to always have a water bottle
handy? Is it reasonable to compel people to
frequently excuse themselves from meetings,
classes and work to use the water fountain
because they cannot access bottled water (or
a cup for their water)?
Michigan Student Assembly, before you
vote on this petition, I beg you to consider
the consequences of your actions. Do you
want people to resort to unhealthy beverages
because you took away their water bottles?
Educate the campus about water and the
impact of bottles through the LSA theme
semester, but please don't make such a bold
decision without considering the social and
health effects.

February has been proclaimed "American Heart
Month," and we would like to share the importance
of living a heart-healthy lifestyle with students, espe-
cially women, on campus. We think it is important
to acknowledge that heart disease is not just an "old-
man's disease." In fact, only 55 percent of women
realize that heart disease is their number one killer,
according to goredforwomen.org. Female heart attack
symptoms are understudied in comparison with male
symptoms. Women are often misdiagnosed, leading to
premature hospital discharge, missed heart attacks
and, consequentially, an increased mortality rate.
Females deserve proper medical care and the same
preliminary precautions as males. In order to approach
equal medical treatment regarding heart disease, we
believe raising awareness in the public sphere is an
important first step.
In an attempt to promote awareness in our own com-
munity, we want to draw attention to the Go Red for
Women Campaign, sponsored by the American Heart
Association. This campaign focuses on encouraging
women to educate themselves about personal heart
disease risks, as well as promoting healthy lifestyles
to actively lower these risks. It also advocates mak-
ing the fight against heart disease a personal mission
and connecting the individual lifestyle with political
action. We want to make young people aware that they
can actively lower their risk for heart disease by mak-
ing heart-healthy decisions now.
Because heart disease can affect women at any age,
the Go Red for Women Campaign offers several tips
for women in their 20s to help promote a heart-healthy
lifestyle. We share these tips in the hope of promoting
this campaign's message on our own campus. College
can take a toll on our bodies both mentally and physi-
cally. Staying healthy is just as important as getting
good grades.
It's important to check your family history of heart
disease. Learn this information now so you can be
aware of your own risk. Don't smoke, and stay away
from secondhand smoke. Drink in moderation. Choose
birth control carefully, Know your numbers: Evaluate
your own cholesterol, sugar and fat levels, blood pres-
sure, BMI and waist circumference. Eat well: Heart-

healthy foods include fruits and vegetables, fiber-rich
whole grains, lean meats and foods low in saturated
and trans fats and sugars. Be active: Make an exercise
routine part of your daily life, make an effort to get off
the couch or visit the gym regularly - briskly walk-
ing to class counts. Watch your weight: Transitions
between relationships, school and work can take a toll
both emotionally and physically. Aim to develop a posi-
tive body image, and take pride in taking care of your
own health. Keep portions small, starteverymealwith
filling foods and drink lots of water. Don't be afraid to
talk to your doctor. Reduce your risk of heart disease
by starting heart disease screenings now.
The Go Red for Women Campaign has a useful,
interactive website that provides women of all ages
with effective and useful tools for taking heart health i
into their own hands. The website offers a BetterU
Program - a free 12-week online nutrition and fitness
program - to help users "makeover" their heart. The
website also provides heart-healthy recipes, weekly
guidance, online journals, support forums and daily
expert tips to guide your quest for developing a heart-
healthy lifestyle. The website provides a Go Red Heart
Checkup as well as background information and statis-
tics regarding heart disease.
If you are interested in joining the fight against heart
disease in women, the website provides an easy way to
donate, share personal stories and get involved with
the campaign. It even has a Go Red store where you can
purchase clothing and other accessories, and proceeds
are directed to heart disease research because, as the
site states, "doing good and looking good are always
in fashion." You can even "like" Go Red for Women on
Facebook to shop, share the information with others or
even receive a free red dress pin - the symbol of the Go
Red campaign. Who doesn't like free stuff?
When women become more informed, they are
more likely to recognize their heart disease symptoms
as potentially threatening and dangerous. It's time to
take your heart-health into your own hands. Go Blue
and Go Red today.

ofyears, and we understand the
difficult situation (lawmakers
are) in, and we've been prepar-
ing and we'll do everything we
can to support student afford-
ability and academic excel-
lence," he said.
Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-
versity's vice president for
government relations, said
yesterday that the University
is in the preliminary stages
of interpreting how the pro-
posed budget will affect Uni-
versity operations. She added
that it is too early to determine
the impact a decrease in state
funding would have on next
year's tuition.
"It's a lot to go through, and
we're just beginning the pro-
cess of really analyzing the
various aspects of the budget,"
Wilbanks said.
She explained that in past
years, state appropriations
were supplemented by federal
stimulus funding. Now that the
state will receive less stimulus
money, there will be no funds
to offset the large cut to higher
education. -
"The state budgets had been
supported in part over the last
several fiscal years by the injec-
tion of federal stimulus funds,
but we knew that there would
be a time coming when those
funds would no longer be avail-
able to plug the budget gaps,"
she said.
The University Research
Corridor - a collaboration
between the University of
Michigan, Wayne State Uni-
versity and Michigan State
University that focuses on max-
imizing the state's resources to
boost the economy - issued a
statement yesterday that said
despite the decrease in funding
that will potentially impact the
universities' research initia-
tives, they will keep collaborat-
ing to foster growth within the
universities, and in turn, the
state.
"We will continue to work as
a partner with the state to bal-
ance fiscal necessity with the
need tokeep all of Michigan's,
public Vniversities strong and
competitive," URC Executive
Director Jeff Mason wrote in
the statement. "We will remain
committed to being a positive
force in reinventing our state

and meeting this century's eco-
nomic challenges - and we've
shown time and again that
investing in higher education
reaps a solid return."
State Sen. Rebekah Warren
(D-Ann Arbor) said in an inter-
view yesterday that while she
applauds Snyder's past endeav-
ors to increase the number
of graduates in the state, she
doesn't understand how the
state can continue to exceed
these goals if it takes funding
away from universities.
"How can (Snyder) say that
(his) goal is to increase the
amount of Michiganders with
a bachelor's degree and above
and then really pull the rug
out from under them by both
giving less financial support to
our public universities and col-
leges?" Warren said.
A major concern Warren
said she has is thatthe decrease
in funding to higher educa-
tion will result in increases to
tuition and decreases in finan-
cial aid and scholarships for
students in the state, which has
happened in the past.
"You're going to see more
of that burden falling on our
families and our students, and
I think you're going to end up
seeing a whole group of our tal-
ented, motivated, young people
being priced out of higher edu-
cation," Warren said.
While Warren said she
wasn't particularly surprised
by Snyder's budget proposal,
she was alarmed by how much
Snyder intended to cut from
different programs.
"I think what was surprising
to me was really the severity of
some of the cuts that we saw,"
she said. "I don't think some of
us were really expecting cutsto
go quite that deep."
Other components of Sny-
der's proposed $45 billion
budget include a $1.8 billion
tax break for businesses in
the state, cuts to the Michi-
gan film tax incentive, the
elimination of tax exemptions
for many Michigan citizens,
including senior citizens, and a
$300-million decrease in statu-
tory revenue sharing for cities.
Snyder recommended the tax
break for businesses by replac-
ing the Michigan Business Tax
with a flat rate 6-percent cor-
porate income tax for certain
companies.
Warren said programs such
as education and welfare will

also suffer from a decrease in
state tax revenue from busi-
nesses if Snyder's proposed
business tax plan is carried
through.
She added that a governor's
budget is symbolic of his or
her personal values about the
state as a whole. By examin-
ing where the governor wants
to allocate or cut state fund-
ing, Warren said it is evident
where the governor's interests
lie, which, for Snyder, is in busi-
ness rather than the people.
"To me, I think the bottom
line (of) a budget is a values
document," Warren said. "If
you even look at your home
budget right now, you figure
out where you spend your
money. That's where your pri-
orities are."
Snyder also proposed yester-
day that his salary for the 2012
fiscal year be $1 since he said
Michiganders will all experi-
ence a "shared sacrifice," the
Associated Press reported.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-
Ann Arbor) said by cutting
from higher education, the
state fails to utilize a pivotal
instrument in facilitating eco-
nomic growth.
"The University of Michigan
is probably our state's single-
best economic development
tool, so cutting back on our best
economic development tool
seems like a bad recipe for eco-
nomic success," Irwin said.
By focusing mainly on
assisting businesses in Michi-
gan, Irwin said, Snyder fails
to see the important role state,
universities play in encourag-
ing businesses development.
"The types of businesses
that we're trying to attract to
Michigan aren't just interested
in taxes. In fact, they're mostly
interested in qualityeducation-
al systems so they can recruit
top talent out of our schools
and so that their employees
can send their kids to good
schools," Irwin said.
Other legislators contacted
by The Michigan Daily, includ-.
ing state Reps. Mark Ouiment
(R-Scio Township) and Chuck
Moss (R-Birmingham), could
not be reached for comment.

running," Del Rio said. "The (Uni-
versity) works because we do."
In his comments to the regents,
GEO Treasurer Daniel Marcin
said though he appreciates his
experience workingas aGSI, many
GSIs undergo financial distress as
a result of their low pay.
"It isn't all about the money,"
Marcin said. "But we deserve a
little more, and that's what we're
asking for."
Other issues GEO speakers
addressed included the need for a
policy for graduate students who
have children and the possibility of
including GSRAs in the GEO con-
tract.
Following the public comments,
Regent S. Martin Taylor (D-Grosse
Pointe Farms) said the adminis-
tration has had issues in the past
with GSIs and GSRAs, but said
he thought GEO and University
administrators could work togeth-
er in the future to resolve problems.
"I hope we can come together
and reach asolutiononthis," Taylor
said. "Itseems to methatifthere's a
will, then there is probably a way."
Marcin said in an interview after
the meeting that he was happy with
the regents' reaction.
"I'm very pleased with what
Regent Taylor said," Marcin said.
"We think that is exactly the view-
point that we have."
However, Marcin said he was
disappointed with the lack of reac-
tion regarding GSRA inclusion in
GEO negotiations.
"We're disappointed that we
were that close to (University)
President (Mary Sue) Coleman, but
we still have not heard back about
the meeting with her to discuss
GSRA representation," he said.
Last Thursday, members of
GEO went to Coleman's office with
an oversized letter detailing their
desire to allow GSRAs to join the
organization so they could gain
collective bargaining rights.
Marcin said it is important that
these issues are finally being rec-
ognized.
"Graduate students are at risk of
being considered minor in relation
to other issues on this campus," he
said. "And it's important thatthe

REGENTS DISCUSS1'U1
STUDY ABROAD
PROGRAM IN ISRAEL

During a presentation on inter-
nationalizationat the University by
Mark Tessler, the University's vice
provost of international affairs,
the regents posed questions about
the absence of a University-spon-
sored study abroad program in
Israel for undergraduates.
After Tessler said he had stud-
ied abroad in Israel, Regent
Andrea Fischer Newman (R-Ann
Arbor) mentioned the recent peti-
tion by University students for an
overseas program in Israel.
Tessler explained that Univer-
sity restrictions don't currently
permit for travel to Israel.
"It is the University's policy that
in countries that are under (U.S.)
State Department ... travel advi-
sory, programs that we might have
there are suspended," he said.
Tessler also said students can
study in countries under a U.S.
State Department travel warning
through other college and univer-
sity study abroad programs.
"We have a fair number of nstu-
dents who, for a variety of reasons,
actually go on an overseas program
at another University because it's
more convenient for them," he said.
"That happens all the time, and
we certainly do send students to
Israel."
He added that students and pro-
fessors can also travel to countries
that don't have programs by sign-
ing a waiver and conducting an
experimental program.
When Newman asked if the Uni-
versity's study abroad policy would
be reviewed because other schools
don't have the same policy, Tessler
said it is something to consider.
"We have kind of looked into
this," he said. "It's certainly fair to
ask how we think about that."
Regent Denise Ilitch (D-Bing-
ham Farms) pointed out that until
recently, Egypt wasn't on the U.S.
State Department travel advisory,
but Israel was.
In an interview after the meet-
ing, University Provost Philip
Hanlon said it might be time to
reconsider the ban on programs
abroad in Israel.
"It's a new issue to me," he said.
"But I am motivated from today's
discussion to look at it."
CAAS GRANTED
DEPARTMENT STATUS
The regents voted yesterday to
officially give LSA department sta-
tus to the Center for Afroamerican
and African Studies.
In his comments to the regents,
University Provost Philip Han-

Ion said CAAS has developed the
strong curriculum, and interest
necessary to operate as a depart-
ment.
"It has reached that level of
maturity where it can be consid-
ered at departmental status," he
said.
According to Hanlon, the new
title will provide CAAS more
resources to strengthen the area
of study.
"Elevatingitto adepartmentwill
fortify its undergraduate program
and graduate studies," he said.
In an interview after the meet-
ing, Hanlon said the center won't
change substantially once it
becomes a department.
"They reallyare at the point that
they're functioning like a depart-
ment," Hanlon said.
BUILDING CONSTRUCTION
ADVANCEMENTS APPROVED
The Board of Regents approved
advancements in the reconstruc-
tion of several campus facilities at
its meeting yesterday.
At the regents meeting in
December, the new design for
Alice Lloyd Residence Hall was
approved. Yesterday, the regents
voted to continue with the recon-
struction.
During the meeting, Timothy
Slottow, the University's executive
vice president and chief financial
officer, said the University is on
time and on budget with the proj-
ect and is prepared to continue the
Alice Lloyd renovations.
"We're ready to roll," Slottow
said.
The $56 million project is
expected to be finished by the
beginning of the fall 2012 semes-
ter.
The regents also approved
renovations to the Geological Sci-
ence laboratories in the Clarence
Cook Little Science Building. The
renovations - which will involve
mechanical, electrical and archi-
tectural updates to areas totaling
about 10,600 square feet - are
projected to cost about $2 million
dollars.
The regents also approved
changing 18,400 square feet of the
School of Social Work's first floor
atrium into clinical space. Previ-
ously, the space held books for the
School of Social Work.<The books
are now disperseid between sev-
eral campus libraries. The project
is estimated to cost $1.85 million.

CAEN

Mirlyn Classic, along with the
CAEN server.
"The purpose of the outage is to
diagnose and if possible to fix seri-
ous problems that have led to past
unplanned power outages of the
entire facility," Giuffrida wrote.
Paul Killey, the University's
executive director of Information
Technology and CAEN, wrote
in an e-mail on Wednesday to all
Engineering students that the
timing of the outage was previ-

ously scheduled and the repair is
unavoidable. He added that the
repair needs to be completed to
avoid future problems with the
system.
"The likelihood and nega-
tive repercussions of another
unplanned outage made the risk
of deferring the outage too high to
accept," Killey wrote.
Despite the need for repair,
Giuffrida wrote in an e-mail
interview yesterday that he is
worried about the scheduling of
the maintenance.
"We are very concerned about
the timing of the outage," Giuf-

frida wrote. "CAEN would never
under normal conditions sched-
ule an outage that affected these
kinds of resources at a point in
time like this."
While the system will be down,
the e-mail states that students
should have access to the wired
and wireless networks within the
College of Engineering.
Engineering junior Jakob
Hoellerbauer said he thinks the
outage is inconvenient because
many Engineering midterms are
next week.
"I have an EECS 280 midterm,
which is a programming class,

and it doesn't directly affect the
midterm because I have to study
for it on my own, but it would help
if I could have practice with pro-
gramming," Hoellerbauer said.
"And for that class it's best to use
Linux on the CAEN system. It
isn't imperative to defining my
grade, but it would be an extra
benefit."
Hoellerbauer added that his
research, which is a mandatory
requirement for the Michigan
Research Community, will be
affected by the outage.
"I have to use MATLAB and
some other software that is only

available on the CAEN server,"
he said, "I was hoping to do some
research over the weekend since
during the week I have home-
work, and I barely have time to do
research, so that kind of puta dent
in my plans."
Though the inability to access
CAEN will be inconvenient, Giuf-
frida wrote in the e-mail inter-
view that students and faculty
were given advanced warning.
"Engineering faculty were con-
tacted about the issue early on as
well," he wrote. "We have encour-
aged them to contact us individu-
ally ifthey have specific questions

and issues. Many have done so
already. My suggestion to the
students when we first contacted
them aboutthe issue onFeb. lwas
to plan ahead."
Engineering freshman Lena
Schneewind said she felt students
were fairly warned about the out-
age.
"We got two e-mails about it,
and there were signs in every
building that CAEN was going to
be down," Schneewind said. "If
(students) were organized and
prioritized their time, then the
outage shouldn't have had that
huge of an effect on them."

there's 32 possible combinations

In keeping with this sense of

separation from whatever music

"Merce choreographed inde-

When Cunningham died in
2009, he made one final request
to the company: to continue
showcasing his work through
one final Legacy Tour before
honoring his wish to disband at
the end of the year.
"It's really the last chance for
a Michigan audience to ever see

Listening to PJ Harvey's new-
est album, Let England Shake, is
like listening to a history text-
book - in the
coolest waypos-*
sible. The Brit-
ish songstress PJ Harvey
brings listeners
back a hundred Let England
years to a time Shake
of old English Island
warfare with a
modern twist.
With tracks like "Let England
Shake," "The Last Living Rose"
and "The Glorious Land," the
album pays homage to her native
land during a time of bloodshed
and tears.
Let England Shake is an eerie
compilation of musical politi-
cal outcry complete with World
War I battle sounds and sinis-
ter lyrics. In "The Worlds That
Maketh Murder," Harvey sings,
"I've seen soldiers fall like lumps
of meat / Blown and shot out
beyond belief / Arms and legs
were in the trees." Morbid and
primal images coalesce with a
baroque, retro sound that creates
a mysterious feel.
The album carries on with
creepy English countryside
imagery, haunting vocals and
shrill tambourines. On one of

(Ohio), the
teams played
nearly a full game with at least
one player in the penalty box.
Last week against Ohio State,
Michigan was forced to kill off a
penalty - including a five minute
major on Saturday in the third
period of both games to preserve
two straight one-goal leads.
But this weekend, in the
second-to-last regular season
series for Michigan, Yost Ice
Arena should see plenty of even-
strength hockey. The Wolverines
and the Broncos are just 31st and
48th in the nation in penalty min-
utes, respectively.
"I think that's what it's going
to come down to," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said after
practice Thursday. "It's a five-
on-five game. Now, you never
know, sometimes you think it's
going to be one way and it's not,
so you don't plan any different ...
That's a strong partof our game. I

players to sta-
tistics, are hard to miss.
With a win, Michigan (8-5
Big Ten, 15-10 overall) would be
tied for third with Wisconsin in
the Big Ten.
The Badgers (9-4, 14-11), who
are coming off of a 59-44 loss
to Iowa, have struggled on the
boards all year - they rank last
in the Big Ten in rebounds per.
game (29.9). Michigan is right
there with them, less than half a
rebound per game ahead.
Part of the reason for both
teams' lack of efficiency on the
glass is their size. Both teams
feature only two players over
the height of 6-foot-2.
But Wisconsin's 6-foot-4
senior forward Lin Zastrow
makes her presence felt in the
post.
"(Zastrow) is good on both
sides of the ball," Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth said after
Michigan's 75-59 victory over
Wisconsin on Jan. 16. "I'll tell
you what, she is as good of a
big kid in this conference. She
scores on people, and she's hard
to score on."
The Wolverines held Zas-
trow, who averages 14 points

per contest, to just nine points
in the first matchup between
the two teams.
That success was due in
part to Michigan's tough post
defense by 6-foot-1 sophomore
forward Rachel Sheffer, along
with 6-foot-4 bench players
Sam Arnold and Kate Thomp-
son.
But where both teams lack
in size, they make up for with
team defense.
The Badgers lead the Big Ten
in scoring defense, allowing just
56.5 points per game, and the
Wolverines aren't far behind in
third place (62.6).
"They are very good defen-
sively," Borseth said. "They are
just an absolute lock you down,
don'tletyouscore type of team."
And each team is at the top
of the conference standings in
turnover margins.
The Wolverines, who lead
the conference with a plus-3.15
average, are just .07 turnovers
ahead of the second-place Bad-
gers.
But Michigan holds the edge
in offensive production - from
both its starters and its bench
players. That very well could
be the Wolverines' key to win-
ning this game - Wisconsin is
second-to-last in the conference
in offensive production, and the
Badger bench has been nearly
non-existent as of late.
Another key factor is the sta-
tus of Wisconsin senior forward
Tara Steinbauer - the team's
third-leading scorer - who left
in the first half of Wednesday's
loss to Iowa with a leg injury.
Yesterday, the team confirmed
that she tore the ACL in her
right knee and will miss the
remainder of the season.
But regardless of the similar-
ities between these two squads,
the Wolverines know what is at
stake with just three Big Ten
games remaining.
"We have momentum right
now," junior guard Carmen

win over Indiana on Wednes-
day. "Hopefully, we will get the
next three wins and ... get a bid

Senior goaltender Shawn Hunwick will need his team to play consistently sound defense against Western Michigan.

jhead coach Jeff Blashill's defen-
sive style and benefited from
hot goaltending from both Jerry
Kuhn and Nick Pisellini to vault
into fourth place in the con-
ference - eight points behind
Michigan.
"It's going to be a dogfight,"
senior defenseman Chad Langlais
said. "There's going to be battles
all over the ice. They're a frus-
trating team defensively and we
are too. So it's going to be a tough
weekend."
Both teams are in the top 10
nationally in goals against and
both are fighting for an at-large
bid.
Michigan's first ticket is for
admission to the tournament on
Selection Sunday. The selection
committee relies heavily on the
PairWise Rankings to select the
16-team field. The Wolverines are
currently on the right side of the

NCAA Tournament bubble, tied
for ninth in the PairWise rank-
ings.
Western Michigan (9-6-9-5
CCHA, 15-7-10 overall) is in a
much more uneasy position, tied
for 15th. With both teams fight-
ing for at-large consideration, a
sweep either way will likely put
the loser on the outside looking
in.
Defensive-minded hockey in a
loser-goes-home series? This isn't
a playoff dress rehearsal, this is
the matinee.
"Every weekend we're playing
in big games," Berenson said. "It
doesn't matter who we're play-
ing now. It's how we're playing.
It matters in that it will make
our team even more aware that
Western's a good team now.
They're not coming in a last place
team any more. They could finish
ahead of us."

Michigan's other ticket is sim-
ply to nowhere. The Wolverines
(16-7-10,19-9-4) are just one point
away from ensuring themselves
the home-ice advantage in the
second round of the CCHA play-
offs. They have already guaran-
teed themselves a first-round bye.
"You want to finish as high
as you can and you want to have
home ice in the playoffs," Beren-
son said. "That's huge. That's one
of our goals. That's not the only
goal."
The final goal is obviously
the national championship. But
reaching the Frozen Four in St.
Paul may hinge on this weekend
at Yost. With two losses, the only
way into the Xcel Energy Center
for April's Frozen Four would
probably be to buy a ticket.
