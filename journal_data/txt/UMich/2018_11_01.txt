In efforts to highlight the 
prevalence of misinformation, 
the Center for Social Media 
Responsibility of University of 
Michigan School of Information 
has developed the Iffy Quotient, 
which measures the proportion 
of “iffy” articles shared on a 
given social media platform.
Social 
media 
platforms 
such as Facebook and Twitter 
make sharing news articles 
— 
whether 
real, 
fake 
or 
somewhere in between — as 
easy as clicking a single share 
button. The spread of news 
can occur at exponential rates. 
As such, fake news has been a 
topic of academic discourse on 
campus since the term became 
popularized during the 2016 
presidential election. Business 
professor 
Andrew 
Hoffman, 
for example, teaches about the 
environment and sustainability 
and told The Michigan Daily 
last fall he views fake news as 
a problem of disengagement 
within academia.
“When you come into the 
classroom, you are an empty 

Some University of Michigan 
faculty took issue with a lack 
of diversity on a panel intended 
to “examine the intersection 
between 
political 
thought/
ideology and faculty members’ 
responsibilities to students” since 
the University publicized the 
panel’s composition in a press 
release Wednesday.
The panel was first announced 
after the University imposed 
sanctions on American Culture 
Associate Professor John Cheney-
Lippold for declining to write 
a 
letter 
of 
recommendation 
for a student applying to study 
abroad in Israel as part of an 
academic boycott of the nation.

ADMINISTRATION

In 
a 
monthly 
interview 
with 
The 
Michigan 
Daily, 
Mark Schlissel, president of 
the University of Michigan, 
outlined the University’s stance 
on the recent denial of letters of 
recommendation for students 
planning to study abroad in 
Israel and the Sixth Circuit 
Court 
verdict 
against 
the 
University’s sexual misconduct 
policies. He also touched on the 
lack of concrete deadlines for 
their recent carbon neutrality 
goal announcement and the 
need for greater investment in 
diversity, in addition to current 
University initiatives and more.

Academic Freedom
Two 
University 
faculty 
members 
have 
rescinded 
offers 
to 
write 
letters 
of 
recommendation for students to 
study abroad in Israel as part of a 
boycott against Israel in support 
of 
the 
Palestinian 
people. 

American 
Culture 
Associate 
Professor John Cheney-Lippold, 
one of the academics who 
denied writing a letter, has faced 
punishment from the University 
including the cancellation of 
sabbatical 
eligibilit, 
frozen 
credits for two years and no 
pay raise for the year. The affair 
has sparked conversation on 
campus about free speech and 
the responsibilities of faculty 
members.
Schlissel said he doesn’t view 
the problem through the lens of 
freedom of expression, noting 
all faculty members are free 
to express their thoughts and 
opinions through other avenues 
such 
as 
teach-ins, 
editorial 
pieces, academic writing and 
speeches. 
He 
said 
personal 
political beliefs cannot come 
before faculty commitments to 
students.
“To me, it’s not free speech,” 
Schlissel said. “It’s a shared 
commitment to help students 
pursue their ambitions.”
Schlissel recalled his own

Nursing DEI panel discusses health

Schlissel says prof. personal politics can’t 
come before commitment to students 

All four panelists note importance of interdisciplinary research and mentoring 

On 
Wednesday 
morning, 
School 
of 
Nursing 
assistant 
professors Lenette Jones and 
Sheria Robinson-Lane, Nursing 
research fellow Jade Burns, and 
Gender and Health Research 
Lab Director Jaclynn Hawkins 
discussed 
their 
research 
on 
health 
disparities 
affecting 
African-American 
and 
Latinx 
communities as part of a panel 
discussion.

During 
the 
discussion, 
they also shared their related 
research and work in mentoring 
students. The event, which was 
a part of the Nursing School’s 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in 
Healthcare Series, saw about 40 
students and faculty members in 
attendance.
Prior to the event, Jones 
said she hoped the panel would 
help students understand why 
looking at data for a wide range 
of populations is essential to 
medical research.
“I hope that the audience, 

especially students, gain a better 
understanding of why we decided 
to become researchers and why 
research with diverse populations 
is important,” she said. “I also 
hope that it is inspiring to learn 
about our backgrounds.”
Nursing 
graduate 
student 
Catherine 
White 
said 
she 
attended the event because she 
hopes to apply what she learns 
from the panel to her career.
“I would like to be a family 
nurse practitioner and I also 
want to be a professor one day, 
she said. “I want to also be able to 

translate research into practice, 
so disparities among minorities in 
research is really important to me 
because it affects my practice.”
While 
all 
the 
researchers 
said 
they 
are 
interested 
in 
studying 
health 
in 
minority 
populations, the focus of their 
research spans a wide variety of 
health disparities and subgroups 
within 
the 
African-American 
and 
Latinx 
communities.

The University of Michigan 
organization First-Generation 
College Students at Michigan 
held 
a 
panel 
Wednesday 
evening, during which first-
generation 
students 
shared 
their experiences abroad, the 
resources they used and how 
they told their peers about 
going abroad.
The event was a part of 
First-Gen week, a slate of 
programming 
dedicated 
to 
raising 
awareness 
for 
resources available to first-
generation students at the 
University. According to a 
2016 campus climate survey, 
first-generation 
students 
constitute 8 percent of the 
University 
student 
body. 
Though the University ranked 
sixth in the nation in number 
of studnets studying abroad 
in 2016, financial constraints 
like cost of living and travel, 
and less institutional memory 
are 
a 
few 
hurdles 
this 
demogrpahic faces with a 
new, and sometimes expensive 
academic 
opportunity. 
The 
barriers extend to low-income 
students as well. LSA junior 
Kallie Bernas told The Daily 
last semester she was not 
able to study abroad despite 
scholarship opportunities. 
“I didn’t have the money to 
support myself without being 
paid for the research I would 
have been doing,” Bernas said. 

“I crunched the numbers and 
decided that I couldn’t do it. 
I didn’t have any financial 
aid based on my household 
income, but it doesn’t really 
take into account the fact that 
I have a lot of siblings and the 
money is being dispersed in a 
lot of ways.”
Panelists 
Heriberto 
Gonzalez, Mallory Sprague, 
Alasia Tardy, Victoria Thach 

and Jana Wilbricht sat at a table 
facing the audience, passing a 
microphone around to answer 
questions and describe their 
experience in the study abroad 
procedure. From choosing a 
program to coming home, the 
five panelists discussed the 
process and how being a first-
generation student affected 
their experiences.
LSA 
senior 
Heriberto 

Gonzalez 
studied 
Public 
Health abroad in Santiago De 
Los 
Caballeros, 
Dominican 
Republic, and said he enjoyed 
the process of finding the 
perfect program for him.
“It’s just really fun to look 
at the programs and see the 
options that they have,” he 
said.

did a service learning program 
in Ishinomaki, Japan, and 
said the Center for Global and 
Intercultural 
Study 
makes 
finding a program a smooth 
process.
“It’s actually pretty easy,” 
she said. “I mean, it’s not 

easy choosing because 
there are so many different 
programs, but the process is 
pretty smooth especially if 
you do it through CGIS.”
LSA junior Alasia Tardy 
said 
she 
studied 
abroad 
in Palestine and Israel in 
the summer following her 
freshman year, where she 
studied 
conflict-resolution 
and coexistence. She said 
going 
abroad 
as 
a 
first-

generation 
student 
was 
exhilarating.
“The process was exciting. 
I’m first-gen, so I felt like I 
had to go abroad,” she said. 
“No part of it was boring. 
From start to end, coming 
back home and all, it was 
amazing.”
Branching out into how 
being 
a 
first-generation 
student impacted her studying 
abroad 
experience, 
Social 
Work student Mallory 
Sprague said she had to 
argue with her family 
members who initially 
thought studying abroad 
was not a good idea.
“I always knew I that 
wanted to go abroad,” 
she said. “I was told by 
my family that it made 
no sense and that I 
shouldn’t. Not only am 
I first-gen, but I’m the 
only person in my family 
who has a passport. In 
doing it, I kind of really 
had to do some soul-
searching 
and 
write 
some good arguments.”
Sprague 
has 
since 
participated 
in 
five 
study abroad programs 
and traveled to Ecuador, 
Italy, England, Russia, 
Amsterdam and Berlin.
Financial aid is a very 
important 
factor 
for 
first-generation students 
in studying abroad, as 
panelists 
discussed 
how proper budgeting 
is a common concern 
students 
have 
before 

leaving. Tardy said handling 
financial aid put her mind at 
ease, as the process was clear 
and smooth.
“I think it was the easiest 
part for me,” she said. “They 
follow 
you 
step-by-step. 
You’re 
never 
questioning 
what’s going on, they’re so 
open and available to you. 
There are so many options 
with financial aid. As soon 
as I talked to Financial Aid I 
never worried again. ”
Some tips and advice the 
panelists gave to fellow first-
generation students included 
going into itwith an open 
mindset, reaching out early 
and remembering there is 
a lot of time to have fun in 
the 
countries, 
too. 
Tardy 
reflected on her time abroad, 
saying there was plenty of 
time for adventure and new 
opportunities.
“We 
swam 
in 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea, 
we 
floated in the Dead Sea, we 
went to so many places and 
yes, we were learning a lot, 
but there was so much time 
for fun as well,” she said.
Communications 
Studies 
doctoral 
candidate 
Jana 
Wilbricht 
echoed 
the 
sentiment of taking the time 
to immerse oneself in the 
local culture.
“Don’t be afraid,” she said. 
“Immerse yourself as much 
as you can in different ways, 
like if there’s a local festival 
happening, just go. That’s 
really how you make a lot of 
authentic experiences.”

vessel and we in the classroom 
teach 
you 
information, 
knowledge, reasoning skills 
and so forth,” Hoffman said. 
“That works in the classroom. 
But the general public, they 
didn’t buy into that contract. 
And so you have to win 
trust and you don’t do that 
by lecturing. You do that by 
engaging.”
It’s also a concept taught 
in 
more 
broadly-focused 
communications classes. She 

said she’s learned about fake 
news as an issue that, if left 
undetected, could alter the 
efficacy of news altogether.
“From what I’ve learned 
about in my digital studies, it’s 
really problematic because it 
can be spread really easily and 
is easily believable,” Freeman, a 
communication studies major, 
said. “This is really problematic 
because people see the news as 
being able to express the truth 
and that feature is being taken 
away.”
This is where the Iffy 
Quotient comes in.
Paul 
Resnick, 
associate 

dean for Research and Faculty 
Affairs 
at 
the 
School 
of 
Information and director of 
the Center for Social Media 
Responsibility, was one of the 
authors of a report on the Iffy 
Quotient published in October. 
He said the purpose of the Iffy 
Quotient is to chart how well 
online platforms are spreading 
news 
overall, 
as 
opposed 
to 
questioning 
whether 
a 
particular site is legitimate or 
not.
“We want to chart the 
prevalence 
rather 
than 
particular instances,” Resnick 
told The Daily.

The Iffy Quotient works by 
compiling a set of the 5,000 
most popular URLs interacted 
with on a social media platform 
on any given day, which is 
provided by NewsWhip. Each 
of the 5,000 articles is then 
screened by Media Bias/Fact 
Check, which is a service that 
determines whether a source 
contains 
misinformation 
or 
bias. The Iffy Quotient is 
then calculated by dividing 
the number of iffy articles by 
5,000.

HAUNTE D HOUSE

RUCHITA IYER/Daily
Michigan Engineering Theme Park Group Partners with MUSKET to produce their first haunted house based on “Stranger Things” in Palmer 
Commons Wednesday night. 

during which he wrote “hundreds” 
of recommendation letters. He 
noted he denied requests for 
letters regularly, stating there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
legitimate 
reasons for denying a letter such 
as not knowing the student well 
enough, but said personal political 
disagreement is not one of them.
Schlissel emphasized faculty 
responsibility 
and 
said 
the 
administration 
hopes 
faculty 
members 
share 
values 
that 
prioritize 
students 
and 
their 
various academic endeavors.
“We also want the faculty to 
share this consensus that it’s about 
the student,” Schlissel said. “It’s 
not about (the professors). It’s not a 
platform for their speech and their 
politics. It’s about our obligation 
to support students. And it can’t 
be imposed as a rule; it has to be 
imposed by values.”
The University also announced 
the creation of a panel to review 
current University policy and 
provide 
recommendations 
for 
amending it. The panel is composed 
of senior faculty members and 
chaired by former University 
President 
James 
Duderstadt, 
and will make decisions on how 
to amend University policy on 
political expression and instructor 
obligations. 
Other 
professors 
criticized the panel, however, for 
a lack of diversity in faculty levels. 
 

Sixth Circuit Court Decision
The U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Sixth Circuit denied the 
University’s request to rehear 
their case regarding the ruling 
that mandates an in-person cross-
examination from the accused in 
sexual misconduct hearings. The 
implications of this result could 
complicate the process followed 
for sexual misconduct claims.
Schlissel 
said 
the 
sexual 

misconduct process needs to be 
redesigned to align better with this 
new ruling. According to Schlissel, 
a large part of this process will 
involve supporting students.
“We have to be consistent with 
the law,” Schlissel said. “The 
council’s office and student affairs 
and then some faculty advisers 
with expertise are looking at our 
existing policy, (with) the goal of 
making sure that we do everything 
possible to support people who are 
coming through the process and 
want to bring forward a claim of 
misconduct.”
Schlissel 
acknowledged 
a 
hearing like the proposed is 
sensitive to both parties involved 
and crafting the hearing to be 
supportive is the goal.
“We’re trying to design a way 
to do that so the questions are 
fair and reasonable to minimize 
the deterrent of coming forward,” 
Schlissel said. “Confronting your 
accuser and vice versa is very 
emotionally challenging and we 
want to minimize the extent to 
which that becomes a barrier to 
reporting. One way we’ll do that 
is structuring the hearing in a way 
that is as supportive as possible to 
both parties.”
The University’s Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center 
and Office of Student Affairs will 
continue to be sources of support 
for the students going through 
this process. The Special Victims 
Unit, which is part of the Division 
of Public Safety and Security, 
will also continue to assist with 
criminal cases. Schlissel said 
the redesign will hopefully be 
available in the next few weeks. 
This new process will have to 
be explained to those coming 
forward.
“We’ll have to make sure that 
when people come forward they 
understand what the process will 
be,” Schlissel said. “It’s always up 
to the individual whether to bring 
forward a case. The idea is to work 
within the confines of the law but 

provide a sufficiently sensitive and 
support environment that people 
feel comfortable bringing forward 
requests for help.”

Carbon Neutrality
Students have recently shown 
a markedly greater concern about 
climate change on campus than in 
recent years, and the U-M Climate 
Action Movement has urged the 
University to set goalsfor carbon 
neutrality in a similar manner 
to other Big 10 universities. The 
University has yet to set a concrete 
goal.
Schlissel 
stated 
the 
administration intends to set a 
goal in the near future and noted 
the University has already pledged 
to 
decrease 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions by 25 percent by 2025, a 
goal that Schlissel is confident will 
be completed early.
Schlissel said he felt it would 
be useless to set a date for carbon 
neutrality when the University 
doesn’t have a plan to achieve it. 
The administration is currently 
in 
the 
process 
of 
gathering 
information and devising a clear 
plan for carbon neutrality with a 
realistic timetable.
“I don’t know how we’re going 
to get there yet. So what good 
does it do for me to put out a 
statement that says I’m going to 
do something on a certain day if 
I don’t know how I’m going to do 
it?” Schlissel said. “We want to do 
it in a way that other organizations 
can follow what we do and become 
carbon neutral themselves.”
Above all, Schlissel expressed 
his desire for the University to be 
a model for other institutions to 
achieve carbon neutrality. He said 
he wants the plan to be thorough 
and effective so that its methods 
can be learned and applied to 
other situations.
“We’re in a very good position to 
be one of the leaders in addressing 
this enormous societal challenge,” 
Schlissel said.

“F” Report Card on Racial 
Equity
According to a report released 
by the University of Southern 
California, the University received 
an “F” on racial equity, specifically 
in the representation of Black 
students on campus.
According to new enrollment 
data, the number of freshmen 
who identify as underrepresented 
minorities on campus increased 
from 13.9 percent in 2017 to 14.8 
in 2018. The number of Black 
students decreased marginally 
in 2017 but increased to about 4.5 
percent in 2018.
Schlissel said while he hasn’t 
read the report, he agrees the 
University could be doing better 
to 
attract 
a 
diverse 
student 
population.
“I think we need to do a ton 
better on the campus environment 
as well as the campus demographic 
around many underrepresented 
and 
marginalized 
groups,” 
Schlissel said. “Right now we’re 
at about 4.5 percent (of Black 
students) and we’re working hard 
to increase that, but we’re not 
meeting with enough success.”
About 
a 
decade 
ago, 
the 
University had nearly double the 
percentage of Black students. 
In that time, Proposal 2 has 
affected the admissions process 
to the University. Proposal 2, 
which was eventually upheld 
by the Supreme Court in 2014, 
deemed the consideration of race 
in college admissions processes 
unconstitutional. Schlissel said 
this 
decision 
contributed 
to 
the decrease in racial diversity 
representation on campus.
“What happened between then 
and now is Proposal 2, which 
makes law around how we’re 
allowed to do admissions work 
and took away one of the tools 
we had to try to work on diversity 
on campus,” Schlissel said. “We 
follow the law so now we have to 
go back and be more creative, try 
new things to work on attracting 

more students from different 
communities to the University of 
Michigan.”
Schlissel added he is optimistic 
about what programs like the Go 
Blue Guarantee and Wolverine 
Pathways have the potential to 
do in terms of the diversity at the 
University. 
“It’s 
(Wolverine 
Pathways) 
focused 
geographically 
on 
communities 
that 
don’t 
send 
proportionate 
numbers 
of 
students to Michigan,” Schlissel 
said. “The first graduates of that 
program are now here on campus. 
First cohort had 89 students; I 
believe 80 of them have gone on 
to a college or university. That’s a 
huge success. That’s great. It’s still 
small numbers, but we want to 
build that up.”
Another aspect of this issue is 
the campus climate for students 
from various backgrounds, which 
is where the Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion initiatives were brought 
into play, Schlissel said.
“That’s what we’re working 
on … with DEI programs to try 
and 
help 
people 
understand 
differences better and tolerate 
differences better and appreciate 
what the experience is like when 
you’re the only person in a class 
who looks like you,” Schlissel said. 
“We’re working on better training 
for our faculty and our GSIs so 
they can manage classrooms more 
sensitively.”

Victors for Michigan Student 
Impact
At his Leadership Breakfast 
earlier 
this 
month, 
Schlissel 
announced 
the 
Victors 
for 
Michigan fundraising campaign 
had reached $5 billion — a 
nationwide 
record 
for 
public 
universities. 
The 
Victors 
for 
Michigan campaign launched in 
2013 and since then, more than 
382,000 donors have contributed 
to the University
Though some of the donations 
are mandated to be used for 

specific projects and initiatives, 
Schlissel explained most of the 
funds are placed in the $11.8 billion 
endowment and continue to incur 
interest. The endowment has seen 
its fair share of controversy in 
recent months, with a Detroit Free 
Press investigation claiming the 
University has invested more than 
$4 billion of the endowment into 
the enterprises of the University’s 
largest donors including Stephen 
Ross, 
Sam 
Zell 
and 
Sandy 
Robertson.
From 
the 
recent 
Victors 
for 
Michigan 
announcement, 
Schlissel said $1.1 billion has been 
funneled to student support.
“With this $1.1 billion, a fraction 
of which is endowment, literally 
thousands of students will have 
their cost of attendance heavily 
subsidized because of the success 
of the fundraising campaign,” 
Schlissel said. “And not just for 
a year or two or three, forever. 
That’s the thing about endowment. 
It’s forever and that’s why we’re 
so zealous about guarding the 
endowment.”
In 
addition 
to 
student 
scholarships, Schlissel emphasized 
the benefit Michigan Medicine, 
buildings renovations, education 
initiatives and more will see from 
the fundraising campaign.
“The $5 billion is lots of other 
things too — biomedical research, 
new modes of education, a lot of the 
new buildings that have happened 
and the renovated buildings on 
campus, the Opportunity Hub 
that’s going in at LSA. Almost 
all of these things wouldn’t 
happen without the generosity 
of the donors,” Schlissel said. “A 
billion and a half of the donors 
are supporting the health system. 
We have this fantastic academic 
medical 
center 
that 
provides 
literally 
cutting 
edge 
intense 
medical care, no matter what your 
illness is. A lot of that is supported 
by research and supported by 
philanthropy.”

make recommendations for the 
University’s 
policy 
to 
clarify 
expectations 
of 
faculty 
with 
regard 
to 
writing 
letters 
of 
recommendation 
for 
students. 
Although there is currently no 
written 
policy 
on 
professors’ 
obligations — or lack thereof 
— to requests for letters of 
reccomendation, a press release 
published Wednesday explains 
faculty members are expected to 
withhold personal and politcal 
beliefs from their responses. 
“Students 
have 
academic 
freedom as well to pursue programs 
of study and research that they 
are most interested in,” Philbert 
said in the release. “Writing 
letters of reference for students is 
a responsibility that arises from 
the educational relationship. The 
university can set expectations for 
instructors charged with teaching 
our students.”
The panel will now review 
institutional 
guidelines 
on 
professors’ political expressions 
and responsibilities to students. 
The Wednesday release also made 
the body’s membership public. 
James 
Duderstadt, 
president 
emeritus and professor of science 
and engineering, will lead the 
panel, and will be joined by 
longtime professors Deborah Ball 
from the School of Education, 
Susan Collins from the School of 
Public Policy, Deborah Goldberg 
from the Department of Ecology 
and Evolutionary Biology, Don 
Herzog from the Law School, and 
Bill Lovejoy from the Ross School 
of Business.
Kirsten Herold, a lecturer in the 
School of Public Health and the 
vice president of the Lecturers’ 
Employee Organization, noted the 
seniority of all the faculty on the 
panel.
“It’s kind of funny, actually, 
when you look at them, that they’re 
all full professors,” she said. “They 
have probably all known each 
other for 20 years at least, which 
is not usually the way we try to get 
diverse voices.”
Herold 
said 
the 
panel’s 
composition left out a variety of 
perspectives, including lecturers, 
who 
are 
often 
intimately 
involved in the process of writing 
letters of recommendation for 
undergraduates.
“Lecturers teach most of the 
first- and second-year classes; we 
often teach small classes, so we 
tend to know the students quite 
well, like the lecturers who teach 
writing and language classes, 

math classes. And they know the 
students well, so the students 
often come to us to ask for letters,” 
she said. “If you really want to 
have a thoughtful, deep dive into 
this complicated issue of –– you 
know, their decision is they want 
to be able to compel people to 
write letters even when they’re not 
necessarily comfortable writing 
them … there’s a lot of different 
ways of looking at this issue.”
History 
Associate 
Professor 
John Carson agreed, noting the 
panel did not include any faculty 
members who worked in the 
humanities.
“The set of individuals, as far 
as I can tell, and I only know a 
few of them, are not necessarily 
those who are particularly close 
to the issue right now,” Carson 
said. “The number of them that 
are likely to be even writing many 
undergraduate recommendations 
is probably on the low side. It 
just seems important given the 
many implications of what the 
committee could come up with 
that the set of individuals helping 
to talk about this be pretty broad 
and diverse.”
In a letter obtained by The 
Daily, 
Philbert 
responded 
to 
concernsraised by the American 
Association 
of 
University 
Professors that the University 
did not follow due process in 
determining the discipline given to 
Cheney-Lippold, which included 
a year-long pay freeze and two 
years of ineligibility for sabbatical 
credits. In a letter addressed to 
Schlissel, Philbert and interim 
LSA Dean Elizabeth Cole, AAUP 
Associate Secretary Hans-Joerg 
Tiede advised AAUP standards for 
the severity of the discipline called 
for an informal inquiry by a faculty 
committee and then a hearing 
before an elected faculty body. 
In the letter addressed to Tiede, 
Philbert 
responded 
Cole 
had 
consulted with the LSA Executive 
Committee, which comprises six 
elected faculty members.
“The university understands 
and wholeheartedly shares your 
respect for the principles of 
appropriate process and fairness,” 
Philbert wrote. “While we do 
not discuss individual personnel 
actions, 
please 
understand 
that the College of Literature, 
Science, and the Arts (LSA) and 
the university as a whole have 
procedural safeguards in place 
of the same nature as the AAUP’s 
Recommended 
Institutional 
Regulations on Academic Freedom 
and Tenure.”

o grow up in the United 
States is to be inculcated with 
the promise that this land is 
unique in its opportunity. 
The legend of the self-
propelled individual is 
ubiquitous for Americans, 
from the revolutionaries in 
Philadelphia establishing 
a new kind of nation to 
the pioneers who grittily 
took the West by force in 
the following century. 
It has instilled the idea 
of 
universal 
economic 
ascendancy, 
typified 
most prominently by the idea of a 
white picket fence and two cars in 
the driveway; it is what most of us 
over the past century would call the 
American Dream. But what happens 
when certain Americans, on the basis 
of their race alone, are so egregiously 
discouraged from attaining this 
dream?
Assuming no inherent disparities 
in intelligence or moral fiber among 
different races exists, calling for 
these 
discriminated 
Americans 
to be afforded the baseline level of 
opportunity should not be heralded 
as magnanimous; it should be 
expected. When the efforts to restore 
parity among all races in this country 
are attainable only through artificial 
means, there should be no act of 
surprise or leap to indignation.
After all, it was only through 
artificial means — more specifically, 
unconstitutional and violent ones 
— that these Americans were 
subjugated in the first place. These 
racially divisive corrections have 
left these Americans to watch on the 
sidelines as the American Dream 
bequeathed all its wonders only to 
those lucky enough to possess the 
proper birthright. What could be 
more un-American?
These 
artificial 
means 
are 
comprised of so-called affirmative 
action policies implemented over 
the course of the last half-century. 
The present day provides a golden 
opportunity to look back on how and 
why these affirmative action policies 
have succeeded and failed where they 
did. The legacy of affirmative action 
remains in housing policy through 
the Fair Housing Act of 1968, but is 
hotly contested in college admissions; 
ultimately, the problems addressed 
by those midcentury reforms have 
continued to persist in ways that 
justify affirmative action in the 
present.
As a tactic promoting equality of 
opportunity among races, affirmative 
action is notoriously difficult to judge 
because of the contrasting vision 
for affirmative action applications.. 
Should the goal be to eliminate 
discriminatory 
practices 
against 
minorities 
and 
thereby 
create, 
from that point on, a level playing 
field? This signature view of earlier 
liberals should be noted as contrary 
to the words of President Lyndon B. 
Johnson, who famously articulated 
the 
reasoning 
behind 
artificial 
restorations of racial parity: “You do 
not take a person who, for years, has 
been hobbled by chains and liberate 
him, bring him up to the starting line 
of a race and say, ‘You are now free 
to compete with all the others,’ and 
still justly believe that you have been 
completely fair.”
Incidentally, the later vision 
of affirmative action that actively 
promoted the hiring of minority 
workers — was not only affirmed 
by Johnson but also carried on 
by Republican President Richard 
Nixon — resembled the controversial 
use of affirmative action in college 
admissions more than the Fair 
Housing Act’s less radical, egalitarian 
language. The 1960s saw the same 
flavor of affirmative action reach 
upper 
education, 
buttressed 
by 
the 1968 Supreme Court decision 
upholding efforts to desegregate 
schools. Finally, it seemed that 
African Americans — along with 
other minorities — were on their 
way to achieving more through more 
balanced college enrollment, which 
would go hand in hand with higher 
material attainment.
However, that dream has not 
yet been accomplished, as there 
are still major racial gaps in college 
enrollment, 
and 
massive 
gaps 
between white and Black wealth 
accordingly. We could look to the 
more egalitarian interpretation of 
affirmative action, in the Fair Housing 
Act of 1968, for answers. Passed in 
the smoldering aftermath of bloody 
riots following the assassination of 
Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, the 
act aimed to help African-American 
families participate in the process 
of home ownership and wealth 
generation from which they had been 
excluded for generations. Decades 
of government-sanctioned redlining 
policies effectively prevented them 

from obtaining mortgages and saving 
earnings, further distancing them 
from the American Dream enjoyed 
by their white peers.
The Fair Housing 
Act has proved to be 
similarly 
incomplete 
when observed with 
affirmative action in 
college 
admissions. 
Even after the Fair 
Housing 
Act, 
cities 
became more Black 
while 
suburban 
centers 
grew 
more 
white. Neighborhoods 
that were redlined 80 years ago are 
much more likely than not to still be 
low-income. Discriminatory lending 
practices are still alive and well, 
which has allowed de facto racial 
segregation to persist in housing. 
The act, and all of the affirmative 
action efforts it entailed, succeeded 
in recognizing the problem but failed 
to pursue a truly effective path of 
remedy.
These efforts also have their fair 
share of critics, many of whom would 
point to the failure of affirmative 
action in college admissions, in 
particular, as an undeniable evidence 
of the practice’s innate faults. The 
idea that correcting centuries of 
Black dismantlement should fall 
on the white and Asian college 
applicants of today is, in the eyes of 
these critics, both unfair and actually 
harmful to the Black students 
affected. The elevation of otherwise-
underprepared Black students in the 
application process is indeed a real 
issue, and this “mismatch” effect is 
clearly supported by the phenomenon 
of disproportionately low college 
achievement among Black students.
However, 
arguments 
that 
affirmative action is unfair to the 
non-Black candidates it displaces and 
characterizations of the mismatch 
effect as an evil inseparable from 
the idea of affirmative action are 
complete mischaracterizations of the 
issue at hand. Critics of affirmative 
action often lament the fact that our 
affirmative action policies only seem 
to lend themselves to minorities well 
past the formative times of childhood 
and adolescence. In this view, 
affirmative action policy effectively 
neglects minority children until 
it comes time to apply for college 
or to a job, only serving to secure 
them seats in colleges they are not 
prepared for and bringing upon them 
all the subsequent shame of being 
an “affirmative action hire” if they 
manage to graduate.
While these are fair complaints, 

they neglect the fact that the 
solution to this problem was already 
implemented in America decades 
ago with forced school integration. 
The landmark U.S. Supreme Court 
decision Brown v. Board of Education 
struck down legally enforced school 
segregation in 1954, but integration 
of schools was only accomplished 
by the advent of mandatory busing 
between 
majority-white 
and 
majority-Black elementary, middle 
and high schools. Not long after, a 
U.S. 
government-commissioned 
report found the individual racial and 
socioeconomic attributes of students 
were less predictive of their future 
academic achievements than were 
their schools’ levels of integration. It 
is unsurprising, then, that the period 
from then until the tapering off of 
mandatory desegregation policy saw 
certain measures of academic ability 
between Black and white teens leap 
dramatically. 
Why, then, was full racial parity 
in education (or something close to 
it) not achieved? The answer is white 
flight. Both politically and physically, 
the white families burdened by 
the act of busing their children to 
lesser schools soon resisted the 
inconveniences associated with full 
educational integration. Often, it 
was by moving to the suburbs that 
whites escaped busing, which left a 
void in their place that would more 
often than not be filled by non-
white families, rejecting the idea of 
integration at its very core. One way 
or another, the level of integration 
achieved was deemed satisfactory 
by the late 1990s, bringing an end 
to the legal justification for forced 

integration in the first place and 
leaving room for many of the same 
disparities to creep back.
This white flight was not 
novel; America had seen it a 
generation earlier, in response to the 
aforementioned Fair Housing Act. For 
all of the controversy surrounding the 
act’s passage, it ultimately demanded 
little more than the equal treatment 
fort those seeking to purchase a 
home. Driven by the same dream of a 
white picket fence and two cars in the 
driveway as their white peers, African 
Americans welcomed the act as a 
relief to the incessant discriminatory 
and 
predatory 
practices 
levied 
against them in the years before 
1968. Despite the earnest ambitions 
of African Americans, the prospect 
of integrated neighborhoods, like 
integrated schools, drove a large 
amount of whites out the inner cities 
and thus solidified the ghetto as the 
community of urban Blacks.
None of this is new knowledge. 
The racialization of the American 
living space and the wholly unequal 
division of society’s resources along 
explicitly racial lines was realized 
by the famous Kerner Commission, 
convened after the rampant riots of 
the summer of 1967. With regard 
to the ghettos now synonymous 
with minority communities, the 
Commission 
was 
unambiguous: 
“White society is deeply implicated in 
the ghetto. White institutions created 
it, white institutions maintain it, and 
white society condones it.”
This is not to say that white 
Americans as an entire race were, 
or are, guilty orchestrators of 
the formation of Black ghettos in 
America. Far from it. They were, 
however, beneficiaries in a country 
simultaneously occupied by those 
who were suffering for no other basis 
than melanin content. Running away 
from the racial nature of the divide 
in the intertwined realms of housing 
and education between Black and 
white Americans is a dangerous first 
step toward not only impeding, but 
also dismantling the goal of equality 
of opportunity.
This is, indeed, a racial issue. If 
the attainment of equal opportunity 
is truly the aim of affirmative action 
policy, then equality of outcome 
should not be a factor. Low-income 
Americans, regardless of race, are 
not the target of affirmative action 
– those disproportionately excluded 
from wealth attainment along lines 
that racial are. Suggestions, largely 
from conservatives, that the structure 
of affirmative action be tweaked 
to target the socioeconomically 
disadvantaged as opposed to racial 
minorities 
reflect 
a 
misplaced 
approach marketed as colorblind.
The reality is that such a 
restructuring would only perpetuate 
the disparities that persist between 
Black and white Americans even 
after income alone is controlled. In 
other words, a colorblind affirmative 
action policy for college applicants of 
lower socioeconomic status would 
still elevate disproportionately more 
whites 
than 
Blacks, 
neglecting 
racial inequities in the aggregate. 
Additionally, the mismatch effect 
would only replicate itself in such a 
scenario, doing nothing to close the 
wide race gap in graduation rates, 
as it would beset Black and white 
Americans alike.
It’s important to note that this 
holistic perspective is often crowded 
out by invocation of such outliers as 
former President Barack Obama or 
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence 
Thomas, whose successes distract 
from the socioeconomic challenges 
facing a vast majority of those who 
would benefit from affirmative 
action policies. Even then, their 
successes are qualified by racially 
disproportionate rates of downward 
mobility, further poking holes in the 
idea that a purely socioeconomic 
affirmative action would constitute 
desirable policy. 
All of this has served to disprove the 
original characterization of affirmative 
action as ineffective. There is also, 
however, the challenge that affirmative 
action at its core is unfair to the majority 
of students it affects, whether it is white 
middle schoolers bussed to inner city 
schools or white college applicants 
rejected from Harvard University in 
favor of Black students. Viewed on 
their own, these actions do, in fact, 
contradict the ideal of meritocracy. 
The idea that every college should get 
its pick of the very best applicants, and 
every student their pick of the very best 
schools they are qualified for, is at odds 
with affirmative action. That much is 
undeniable.

Preparing the world’s next business leaders
B

lackRock, the $6 trillion 
investment 
firm, 
announced 
early 
last 
week that it plans to 
introduce 
a 
suite 
of 
sustainable 
exchange-
traded funds. Customers 
will be able to choose an 
investment vehicle that 
will invest their funds 
in 
environmentally 
sustainable enterprises. 
Brian Deese, the global 
head 
of 
sustainable 
investing at BlackRock 
believes the new offer is a 
business imperative: “Sustainable 
investing 
is 
becoming 
mainstream investing.”
This is not BlackRock’s first 
socially responsible decision — in 
January this year, Laurence Fink, 
the founder and chief executive 
of BlackRock, wrote a letter to the 
world’s most powerful business 
leaders saying their companies 
need to contribute to society if 
they want to receive financial 
support from BlackRock. It’s 
energizing to see Fink use his 
clout (BlackRock is the world’s 
largest investor) to make such 
demands.
In addition, Fink was one of 
the first corporate chiefs to back 
out of the Future Investment 
Initiative in Saudi Arabia after 
the 
suspicious 
disappearance 
of 
Saudi 
journalist, 
Jamal 
Khashoggi. His refusal to attend 
reveals his actions support his 
beliefs against corruption.
BlackRock clearly supports 
the argument that private sector 
organizations 
can 
achieve 
impressive 
financial 
results 
while having a positive impact on 
society.
As an undergraduate student 
studying at the Ross School of 
Business, this idea has frequently 
surfaced. My peers and I have 
been exposed to a multitude of 
private sector organizations that 
use their power to work toward 
solving some of the most pressing 
challenges our society face. This 
exposure (through coursework, 
extracurriculars 
and 
various 
programming) can be attributed 
in some part to the hard work of 
Jerry Davis, the associate dean of 
the Business School.

Davis 
leads 
the 
Business+Impact initiative – a 
multidisciplinary initiative that 
provides programs 
and opportunities 
to students with 
the 
skills 
and 
knowledge 
to 
become 
“social 
impact 
leaders.” 
Davis 
and 
his 
colleagues 
define 
define social impact 
as 
promoting 
“a 
significant, 
positive 
change 
that addresses a pressing social 
challenge.”
The Business+Impact initiative 
has created a slew of opportunities 
for students pursuing careers 
that positively impact society, 
regardless 
of 
whether 
those 
careers are in the private, public 
or nonprofit sectors. Students of 
all majors and disciplines can take 
advantage of different courses, 
lectures, summits and challenges 
offered 
every 
semester. 
(A 
comprehensive list of the available 

opportunities can be found at 
www.RossImpact.com.)
I 
could 
tell 
during 
my 
conversation 
with 
Davis 
that 
he 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
Business+Impact initiative. His 
enthusiasm over procuring the next 
generation of social impact leaders 
was contagious. This enthusiasm, 
paired with his retelling of how he 
managed to become interested in 
this work, was inspiring.
Much of Davis’ early research 
focused on corporate governance 
for large American corporations 

and the effects of finance on 
society. 
Davis 
began 
noticing 
during his years as a researcher the 
far-reaching implications of the 
tech boom on the U.S. economy. 
With the displacement of millions 
of American jobs that are now 
outsourced or eliminated, Davis 
realized the private sector (what 
remained of it at least) needed to 
have a more positive impact on 
society.
The Business+Impact initiative 
mirrors well known initiatives 
at other prestigious universities. 
In fact, business schools across 
the 
globe 
have 
made 
social 
impact and sustainability (more 
broadly known as corporate social 
responsibility) core pillars of their 
curricula.
This 
strategic 
modification 
of 
the 
curriculum 
comes 
as 
a 
response 
to 
students’ 
dissatisfaction 
with 
the 
most 
recent financial crisis. Business 
schools, as the common stereotype 
goes, are breeding grounds for 
selfishness and greed – and the 
financial crisis served to reinforce 
that stereotype. Schools began 
teaching the world’s next business 
leaders that they should consider 
the effects of their decisions on a 
variety of stakeholders (including 
employees, the community and 
the environment) instead of simply 
shareholders.
Harvard 
University 
and 
the 
Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 
Technology 
recently 
began 
offering a new course on the ethics 
and regulation of technology and 
artificial intelligence, and Stanford 
University plans to follow suit this 
upcoming semester. These courses 
will teach students to consider what 
is right and wrong when it comes 
to developing innovations that can 
have destructive implications for 
consumers.
As universities concentrate on 
corporate social responsibility, the 
next generation of business leaders 
will be more willing and prepared 
than ever to tackle the pressing 
societal issues of our time. Hopefully 
we will see more Laurence Finks in 
corporate America.

For a good while now I’ve been 

searching for clear footage of 
M.I.A.’s performance at the 2009 
Grammy Awards, intrigued by 
the quite mythological reverence 
articles that describe the dignified 
spectacle of it all. While a filtered 
recording of the ceremony on 
Dailymotion scratched the itch, 
I was in awe when I saw it unfold 
in crystal clear definition about 
halfway through the documentary 
“MATANGI / MAYA / M.I.A.” 
Enter Mathangi Arulpragasam, 
her polka dot top making no effort 
to hide her nine-months-pregnant 
belly, swaggering onto that stage. 
She just barely got through “I fly 
like paper, get high like planes” 
before a hard cut to grainy, visceral 
newsreel footage of an airport 
bombing in Sri Lanka.

Harsh juxtapositions like this lie 

at the core of “MATANGI / MAYA 
/ M.I.A.,” a glitchy depiction of the 
rapper / singer / producer / activist 
M.I.A., directed by her longtime 
friend Steve Loveridge. Comprised 
mainly of heaps of archival footage 
pulled from over two decades of 
her life, the film is a comprehensive 
delve into the life of M.I.A., a 
polarizing figure in her own right, 
behind the music and beyond the 
stage.

Like many others, I’ve always 

been a fan of M.I.A.’s catalogue 
— no one has even come close 
to her masterful ability to fuse 
hip-hop, electronic and world 
music into a compelling product 
entirely specific to both herself and 
outsider, immigrant experience 
— but have never known how to 
reconcile with her politics. Sure, 
I can appreciate the impact her 
monumentally exceptional albums 
Arular and Kala had on popular 
music, but I simply cannot fully 
understand the power dynamics 
at play in Sri Lanka, her home 
country, as someone born and 
raised in the comfort of the United 
States.

In 
portraying 
such 
an 

atypical popstar like M.I.A., the 
documentary offers an objective 
look at her life: where she came 
from, the environment in which 
she was raised and the personal 
reasoning behind all her opinions 
that often warrant the moniker 
of 
“terrorist” 
from 
American 

media. It does this by employing 
her music mostly as background 
accompaniment. 
M.I.A. 
knows 

she will be remembered for more 
than her discography, and she 

wants that; “MATANGI / MAYA 
/ M.I.A.” understands this and lets 
the artist take center stage with 
little to no obstruction from the 
documentarian.

Loveridge must have thanked 

his lucky stars M.I.A. wanted to 
be a filmmaker when she grew 
up, because there is a wealth 
of homemade videos from her 
childhood 
and 
teenage 
years 

which gives the doc a quite holistic 
quality. There’s footage of her 
shooting the shit with her friends 
during her time at Central Saint 
Martins Colleges, there’s footage 
of her producing songs with then-
boyfriend Diplo, there’s footage 
from a tour with friend and Elastica 
frontwoman Justine Frischmann. 
It’s safe to say either M.I.A. or 
someone else was filming every 
major life event of hers. Rarely does 
Loveridge opt for showing more 
contemporary 
interviews 
with 

the artist; he lets real life speak for 
itself.

The documentary follows a 

somewhat linear structure, but 
it often returns to a trip M.I.A. 
took to Sri Lanka before she was 
engulfed by the public eye. The 
M.I.A. depicted in these pre-

Arular 
days 
is 
affectionately 

referred to as Maya, a young girl 
struggling to come to terms with 
her own displaced identity. In 
these vignettes, you see the deep-
set reasoning behind her views 
and come to empathize with her 
fellow Tamils, who were brutally 
oppressed by the government and 
lived in constant fear. “MATANGI 
/ MAYA / M.I.A.” never tries to 
push an agenda. It only wants the 
viewer to understand the deadly 
pressure 
cooker 
environment 

which fueled M.I.A.’s impassioned 
rhetoric and the ignorance that 
comes with labeling her as a 
hypocritical terrorist sympathizer.

There is a bit of slant when 

it comes to portraying M.I.A.’s 
critics, but it is often a symptom of 
righteous anger. The documentary 
leaves the viewer sharing in 
that anger, as it’s hard not to 
be mad at Lynn Hirschberg for 
misrepresenting her in a New York 
Times profile or Bill Maher for 
being patronizing and essentially 
telling her to stick to music in a 
nationally 
televised 
interview. 

There is also an insane montage 
surrounding 
her 
performance 

at a Super Bowl halftime show 
where she flipped off millions of 
viewers. M.I.A. walking through 
the tunnel to “The Message” with 
the audience aware she’s about to 
willingly piss off a sizeable chunk 
of white America proves she is 
more punk rock than any of us.

While one can’t help leaving the 

theater thinking the documentary 
was 
slightly 
disjointed, 

“MATANGI / MAYA / M.I.A.” 
is an unapologetic exploration 
of one of the 21st century’s most 
important artists, standing out 
in the world of carefully curated 
music documentaries. You may 
hate M.I.A.’s politics, and if so, the 
documentary won’t do anything 
to change that. But like it or not, 
M.I.A. has earned her place as one 
of the baddest girls in music and 
doesn’t care for anyone’s attempts 
to shut her down. She’s going to 
keep doing what she wants, and do 
it well.

“MATANGI 
/ MAYA / 

M.I.A.”

Abramorama

Michigan Theater

Last week, I read about Cardi 

B’s paid performance at the bar 
mitzvah of Ryan Lutnick, the son 
of Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor 
Fitzgerald. Apparently, Cardi was 
paid around $500,000 to attend 
the event — she performed, took 
photographs with some of the 
guests and even posted about the 
event on her Instagram account.

While I am no particular fan 

of Cardi’s music, I was still fairly 
upset to hear about this. I like 
to think of musicians as being 
separate from the pressures of the 
market. Whether it be the most 
abstract, academic sound art or 
the most popular, low-budget 
SoundCloud rap, I like to think that 
musicians are never entirely reliant 
on money. I like to think that their 
performance at an event cannot be 
bought by the highest bidder.

Ultimately, I worry that in 

taking money to appear at a party, 
Cardi discredits her own work as 
something that can be bought and 
sold — something with no artistic 
value independent of its monetary 
value. It is no longer a vehicle for 
self-expression but a vehicle for 
profit generation.

Now, I will of course concede 

that it is not my place to make grand 
statements about Cardi’s music; I 
am far from the biggest fan of rap 
and popular music. And culturally, 
as a white male from Westchester, 
N.Y. studying classical music, I 
think few would perceive me to 
be Cardi’s usual, if not intended, 
audience.

Nevertheless, I think it is 

important 
to 
think 
critically 

about the culture changes that the 
internet has brought to previously 
geographically (and I would argue 
demographically) contained art 
forms. 
Anyone 
with 
Internet 

access can now consume any music 
that they desire. Art is becoming 
democratized. 
And 
there 
is 

perhaps no better example than 
the integration of rap and hip hop 
music into the larger pop music 
lexicon.

What I worry about is the line 

between cultural appropriation 
and genuine cross-cultural interest 
that often gets blurred in this era of 
democratized art. A good example 
of this cross-cultural appropriation 
is 
Duke 
Ellington’s 
“Jungle 

Jamboree” spectacle. As I learned 
in musicology last year, Ellington 
gave a much-criticized televised 
performance in what was deemed 
“jungle” attire — racist Flintstones-
esque attire modeled after the 
stereotypical “primitive African” 
musician. Ellington received a lot 

of criticism for this attire but also 
a lot of fame. And while I think it 
is hard to fault Ellington for doing 

this, it is easy to fault the culture 
that sought out this performance 
for encouraging Ellington to do 
this.

On a much larger scale, I fear the 

same about Cardi’s general cultural 
presence, at least in the cultural 
circles in which I witness her being 
referenced. I fear that she has been 
used in popular as a connotatively 
distinct “other,” as a dog-whistle to 
those that take pleasure in noting 
her mannerisms that fall outside 
the mainstream.

Cardi’s appearance as co-host 

on Jimmy Fallon’s show last year, 
for example, was a particularly 
awful example of this. She made 
some jokes on the show that were 
funny both to her and the audience. 
But most of the time, I noticed, 
this upper class majority-white 
audience was laughing not with 
her but at her. They laughed at her 
funny pronunciations, her strange 
answers to Fallon’s questions and 
her general “otherness.”

It is important, I will note, 

to differentiate between forced 
expression and self-expression. 
Cardi does seem to be expressing 
herself in these appearances and I 
do not get the sense that she does so 
as a means of conforming to defined 
cultural 
expectations. 
Much 

like Ellington, however, I think 
this undertow of stereotypical 
“otherness” is very much present, 
if not in the artist than in the 
audience.

The best example of this on 

campus, in my opinion, is our 
Greek life culture. Full disclosure: 
I am incredibly skeptical of Greek 
life and am known to criticize it 
frequently among friends. I rarely 
walk by the frat houses on Central. 
But a couple of weeks ago, when I 
found myself walking there late at 
night, I was struck by the music 
playing at many of these frat 
parties. Almost every fraternity I 

passed was blaring rap music.

My 
immediate 
emotional 

reaction was one of being upset, 
but I couldn’t place where these 
feelings were coming from. Then 
all of a sudden it hit me. In one 
of the songs I heard a particular 
fraternity listening to, the main 
singer said the n-word multiple 
times. I’m not sure if any of these 
brothers sang the word along with 
the song. But I could tell that they 
were consuming this because they 
thought it was cool; because they 
were attracted to the “otherness” 
of 
the 
music 
without 
any 

understanding of what it stood for.

Rap music was traditionally a 

means of expression for those that 
had been shut out of American 
popular culture for geographic, 
economic 
and 
demographic 

reasons. It is not something to be 
bought by a rich CEO for his son’s 
bar mitzvah. It is not something 
for a bunch of brothers in what 
is historically an economically, 
racially and culturally exclusive 
organization to listen to while 
they party. It is a genuine means of 
expression for those that couldn’t 
pay half a million dollars for their 
family event or probably couldn’t 
get into a fraternal organization.

I don’t know what the solution 

to this problem is, and I don’t know 
if it is my place to propose any 
solution. I don’t mean to say that 
Cardi should not be compensated 
for her private performances or 
that it is up to me to decide where 
she should and should not perform. 
And I don’t think it is up to me to 
tell fraternity brothers what music 
they can and can’t listen to.

But I do think it is my place to 

call out those who engage with this 
music for all the wrong reasons. I 
do think it is absolutely the duty of a 
white audience member at Fallon’s 
show to refrain from engaging in 
this stereotypical laughter at the 
way that Cardi communicated 
through tongue clicks or other 
extra-verbal tics.

Every artist has a right to 

express themselves however they 
choose, but not every audience 
member has a right to consume art 
however they chose. It isn’t a crime 
to listen to music from a different 
culture, but it is inappropriate 
to consume it for its “otherness” 
with no understanding of its 
historical underpinnings. Music 
isn’t divorced from culture — every 
style of music has a history behind 
it, and without understanding this 
history you can’t fully understand 
and appreciate what you are 
consuming.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘ALIEN’

Dream pop duo Beach 

House 
has 
always 
been 

difficult to categorize. The 
ambient sprawl of albums 
like 
Depression 
Cherry, 

Bloom and most recently 7 
extends past the clear-cut 
minimalism of bands like 
The xx, yet also does not 
quite reach the same level of 
jarring starkness as artists 
like 
Arca. 
Beach 
House 

fuses elements of pop and 
indie rock underneath thin 
layers of warped, abstract 
production. Never enough to 
hit the complete surrealism 
of, say, FKA Twigs’ LP1, 
but just enough to send 
elements 
of 
their 
songs, 

the various synths, chords 
and vocalizations skyward. 
Beach House’s music always 
seems to come at you from 
a 
great 
distance, 
resting 

high 
above 
the 
clouds. 

Their most recent single 

“Alien” is no different, and 
its accompanying animated 
video fits the song’s dream-
like quality perfectly.

“Alien”’s video showcases 

a fluid progression of black 
and white geometric shapes. 
Much like a Rob Gonsalves 
painting, the music video 
plays heavily with positive 
and negative space: A series 
of black triangles swimming 
across a white background 
expands into a series of 
white triangles swimming 
across a black background; 
a globe of shifting black and 
white patterns flattens into 
a solid black horizontal line; 

black shapes emerge as plant 
shoots, growing upward until 
they extend into the horizon 
like a ghostly highway. In 
a similar sense to previous 
animated videos “Lose Your 
Smile” and “Lemon Glow,” 
the point of “Alien”’s video is 
not to tell an illustrated story 
of the song itself, but rather 
to fit the song’s slow, steady 
and organic rise and fall of 
tempo.

In watching the “Alien” 

video, you not only get an 
idea of the song’s overall tone 
but also a glimpse of Beach 
House’s overall essence; just 
as the video seems to exist 
in an alternate dimension, 
so does Beach House — the 
duo’s musical transcendence 
warping time and space into 
nonconformity.

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘KING OF THE HILL’

There 
was 
no 
way 

that 
a 
collaboration 

between 
Thundercat, 

BADBADNOTGOOD 
and 

Flying 
Lotus 
could 
ever 

live up to expectations. But 
“King of the Hill” comes 
close, a song released as a 
single from the upcoming 
Brainfeeder X compilation 
of highlights and unreleased 
tracks by artists on Flying 
Lotus’s independent label 
Brainfeeder.

If 21 Savage and MF 

DOOM were ever to rap 
on the same track, I would 
expect the beat to sound 
like the intro to “King of the 
Hill”: a tonally menacing mix 
of eerie bells and cartoonish 
strings.

When 
the 
song 
does 

finally kick in, it’s a space 
funk jam propelled forward 
by the power of Thundercat’s 
bass. If you don’t know who 

Thundercat is, he is maybe 
the best active funk bassist 
right now; if you know of a 
tepid or boring Thundercat 
bass line, please send it my 
way, because I just don’t 
believe it exists.

In “King of the Hill,” 

sparkling Rhodes piano keys 
and 
Thundercat’s 
soulful 

layered falsettos glide over a 
pulsating bedrock of drums 
and bubbly jazz bass. “The 
king in his castle / The king 
of the hill / Wasting his time 
/ Chasing cheap thrills,” 
he hums, and the resulting 
melodic ambiance is the best 
possible blend of all three 
artists’ individual sounds.

I mean, there really isn’t 

much more to say about 
it. 
Thundercat 
is 
good. 

BADBADNOTGOOD is good. 
Flying Lotus is good. It’s a 
good song, OK? Just listen 
to it.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


In early Oct., the 11th series of 
“Doctor Who,” a sci-fi thriller with 
a cult-like following, premiered. 
Everything seemed on par with 
a typical season — the quirky 
Doctor, the shocked bystanders, the 
impending doom from beyond — but 
there was one apparent difference. 
For the first time in the 55-year run 
of the show (which includes a much 
needed hiatus from 1989 to 2005), 
the witty, beloved Doctor is being 
played by a woman.
For 
those 
unfamiliar 
with 
“Doctor Who,” here’s a quick crash 
course: The Doctor is an alien time 
lord that regenerates a new body 
every time the current one is too 
severely damaged to be healed 
normally. There have been 13 
Doctors in the history of the show, 
starting with the original Doctor, 
William Hartnell (“To Have and 
to Hold”) in 1963 and culminating 
in the reveal of Jodie Whittaker 
(“Trust Me”) as the thirteenth 
Doctor in 2017.
The show doesn’t shy away 
from its controversy — it leans into 
it. When a character informs the 
Doctor that she is a woman, she’s 
shocked. “Am I?” she replies, “Does 
it suit me?” Later, the Doctor is 
talking with a young female police 
officer who is reluctant to report 
the show’s bizarre incident to her 
boss. The Doctor tells her, “You’re 
worried about how you’ll explain all 
this to a superior officer who won’t 
believe you.” It’s a clear shoutout to 
the #MeToo movement and the lack 
of credibility given to a woman’s 
voice. Coming from a male Doctor 
the statement wouldn’t carry much 
weight, but the conscious choice of 
having a female Doctor, knowing 
the public repercussions, gives the 

words a level of power.
It’s a decision that for many 
was long overdue. The past few 
years have seen a renaissance of 
female representation, with iconic 
movies like “Ghostbusters” and 
the “Ocean’s” franchise being 
remade with all-female casts. And 
for a show that stands strong at the 
center of nerd-culture television, 
having a woman in the lead role 
would be a welcome departure 
from the constant stream of men 
as leaders and women as their ditzy 
or weaker sidekicks (“Big Bang 
Theory” binge-session anyone?).
Or 
maybe 
not. 
The 
announcement of Whittaker as the 
doctor was met with an avalanche 
of responses from the public, and 
an unfortunate amount of them 
were negative. Most were overtly 
sexist, as viewers seemed able 
to conceptualize a two-hearted, 
time-traveling humanoid alien but 
not the fact that a woman can play 
that role. The backlash escalated to 
the point where BBC had to issue a 
statement justifying their decision 
to cast Whittaker.
It’s not revolutionary to declare 
that nerd culture is ridden with 
misogyny. 
There 
is 
TEDtalk 
after 
thinkpiece 
after 
op-ed 
that addresses this issue. But as 
more women are represented in 
strong leading roles, it’s becoming 
painfully apparent that this vicious 
behavior and sexism is not isolated. 
The shouts of boycotts and entitled 
“how-dare-yous” 
have 
been 
prevalent against strong female 
leads long before “Doctor Who” 
had the audacity to put a talented 
woman on screen. When Glenn 
Close (“The Simpsons”) played 
a hard-hitting attorney on FX’s 
“Damages,” her character was 
called a liar, backstabber and — a 
fan-favorite — a bitch. The premiere 
of “Wonder Woman” in 2017 and 

subsequent all-female screenings 
left many men calling unfairness 
and reverse sexism. If the focus 
is on a woman, particularly an 
independent and powerful one, 
backlash is practically inevitable.
There is a consistent similarity 
between the media that garners 
backlash: They all originally started 
with males, and have replaced 
those men with women. This is 
where the unacceptance is born. 
Men and women alike harbor 
misogyny that tells them a woman 
could never fill the shoes of man. It’s 
a sentiment that carries real-world 
consequences beyond potentially 
ruining a TV show for close-
minded individuals. Just look at 
Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential 
campaign. Or the fact that women 
make up only 5 percent of Fortune 
500 CEOs. There is a widely held 
sentiment that women can not 
do the job of a man, and this has 
detrimental effects on everything 
from our politics to our media.
So how do we fix this? While 
we’ve made a lot of progress, 
there are clear indicators that the 
problem of sexism still remains. 
There is no easy answer to this, 
but I have a simple suggestion: 
Keep making people angry. I 
want 100 more Jodie Whittaker’s 
taking roles that used to belong 
to men. I want a female remake 
of “Die Hard” and “Superbad” 
and all three installations of “The 
Godfather.” I want women of all 
body types, races and identities to 
saturate our media until the people 
who hate them have nothing left 
to watch. With every disgruntled 
viewer a show loses, there are 10 
little girls feeling empowered and 
excitedly pointing at the screen 
because they see someone that 
looks just like them in their favorite 
show. They are our future. Let’s not 
let them down.

New ‘Doctor’ exposes the

TV NOTEBOOK

BBC

“Indivisible,” the latest release 
from Pure Flix — purveyors of 
fine copy-and-pasted sermons 
disguised as real movies and 
the odd “Donald Trump is the 
Second Coming; liberals are the 
real Nazis” propaganda piece 
— opens with stock footage of 
soldiers at war set to audio of 
children reciting the Pledge of 
Allegiance. Not only does this 
have literally nothing to do with 
the rest of the film beyond the 
reality that “Indivisible” does, 
in fact, feature both soldiers and 
children, it actually does the 
film that follows a disservice. 
“Indivisible” 
isn’t 
good 
by 
any standards other than the 
incredibly low bar Pure Flix 
has set for themselves, but it 
also isn’t, as that opening would 
imply, “God’s Not Dead 4: God 
Goes to Iraq.”
Rather, it follows the true 
story of Darren Turner (Justin 
Bruening, “He’s Out There”), 
an army chaplain who was 
deployed to Iraq in 2007 and 
returned home with PTSD that 
threatened to tear his family 
apart. For the first time in their 
company’s history, Pure Flix 
has stumbled upon a movie 

that’s about something: the 
effect deployment can have on 
families. If you think that sounds 
like something the people best 
known for a trilogy of movies 
based on the most generic 
worship song in existence are 
in no way qualified to handle, 
you would be right. Pure Flix 
drops the ball on what could 
have been an inspiring movie 
by continuing to 
misunderstand 
their 
core 
message, 
but 
before everything 
falls 
apart, 
“Indivisible” 
does show some 
promise.
Most of this is 
down to the cast. As with last 
year’s surprisingly watchable 
“The 
Case 
for 
Christ,” 
“Indivisible” 
proves 
to 
be 
genuinely well-acted, especially 
by 
Sarah 
Drew 
(“Grey’s 
Anatomy”) as Darren’s wife 
Heather. In a role that director 
David G. Evans (“The Grace 
Card”) does everything to help 
her with — Heather’s scenes 
are shot like a commercial for 
a for-profit community college 
— Drew manages to build the 
only character in the film with 
some sort of internality. Sure, 
her husband deals with PTSD, 

but that’s mostly communicated 
through external means and 
out-of-nowhere bursts of sudden 
anger. Drew’s character isn’t in 
the spotlight nearly as much, yet 
due to her performance, Heather 
feels much more fully formed.
Pure Flix does deserve some 
credit for at least attempting 
to make a movie about faith in 
times of war as well. There’s 
plenty of the clunky 
sermonizing we’ve 
come 
to 
expect, 
but the fact that 
it’s in service of an 
idea rather than 
just preaching to 
the choir goes a 
long way. That’s 
definitely 
not 
high praise, but then, most of 
what works about “Indivisible” 
works because of just that; other 
Pure Flix films have failed so 
completely 
that 
when 
their 
newest reaches even baseline 
competence, it’s a win. Every 
Muslim character is not treated 
as a terrorist; there’s one who 
plays a mourning father. Good 
for you, Pure Flix! The atheist 
character is not struck by a car 
and killed for his sins on the 
way to a Newsboys concert; he 
becomes a Christian, then he’s 
killed. Good for you, Pure Flix! 
The abused wife does not learn 

that she is the problem; she’s 
only half the problem. Good for 
you, Pure Flix! At this rate, by 
the mid-2020s, you may even 
start exhibiting basic human 
empathy!
Then we come to the second 
half, where “Indivisible” has 
to provide commentary on a 
difficult subject and finds it 
just isn’t up to the task. Darren 
doesn’t have PTSD after he 
returns; it concludes. But not 
really. He’s just not believing in 
God hard enough. This is Pure 
Flix’s biggest problem: their 
constant 
Biblically 
incorrect 
preaching that Christianity can 
and will solve all your problems 
before you can say “Jesus.” 
That’s not how faith works. 
That’s not how the Bible even 
says faith works. Speaking as 
a Christian who has dealt and 
continues to deal with mental 
illness, it can be useful when 
dealing with these things. It 
can be a comfort. It can be a 
guiding system. It isn’t, like 
“Indivisible” argues, a one-stop 
shop for curing all your ails, and 
until these films can understand 
that, they will continue to come 
close yet still fail as “Indivisible” 
does.

FILM REVIEW

“Indivisible”

Ann Arbor 20 + 
IMAX, Goodrich 
Quality 16

Pure Flix

There is nothing quite like 
the magic of a musical. Arguably 
the most “extra” segment of the 
entertainment world, musicals 
allow us to simultaneously escape 
reality through vibrant costumes, 
song and dance and aggrandized 
emotions, while still grounding us 
in reality by exploring universal 
human truths or life lessons. Out 
of the broad pool of musicals that 
have taken the bold leap into film 
adaptation, there are few that find 
success: “Rent,” “Les Misérables,” 
“West Side Story” and a sprinkling 
of other fabulous theater-to-film 
pieces. The one essential ingredient 
that all of these iconic adaptations 
share is that they adapt, which is 
where “Been So Long” falls short. 
Though filled with well-defined 
and intriguing characters and a 
solid plot, Netflix’s latest musical 
romance forgets that audiences 
are watching through their laptop 
screens, not in the balcony seats of 
a live Broadway production. 
Secure with herself, unbending 
in her morals and protective of 
her heart, Camden resident and 
single mother Simone (Michaela 
Coel, 
“Chewing 
Gum”) 
isn’t 
exactly looking for love. With 
her daughter’s 
upbringing as 
her top priority, men are close to 
the last thing on her mind. One 
night, after some coaxing (and 
alcohol) from her boisterous and 
bold best friend Yvonne (Ronke 
Adekoluejo, “Christopher Robin”), 
Simone finds herself in a match of 
back and forth flirtatious banter 
(in song-form) with an attractive 
and mysterious stranger named 
Raymond (Arinzé Kene, “The 
Pass”), who Simone soon learns has 
a criminal record. When Simone’s 

blunt probing into Raymond’s 
past hits a nerve and he leaves the 
bar with a bruised ego, it seems 
that the twos’ paths are unlikely 
to cross again. Sure enough, 
however, Simone and Raymond 
meet again later that night on the 
bus and, induced by their curiosity 
about one another and magnetic 
chemistry 
to 
rekindle 
their 
connection, they exchange phone 
numbers. As the film progresses, 
Simone struggles to sift through 

her conflicting feelings of desire 
and affection for Raymond and her 
fears of rashly falling for a man she 
worries she can’t trust. 
To Michaela Coel and Arinzé 
Thomas’s credit, the two actors are 
successful in making the romance 
between Raymond and Simone 
genuine. One of the most tangible 
moments occurs when the two 
share a duet, purely and deeply 
expressing their feelings for one 
another under the glowing, pink-
tinged ambiance of Raymond’s 
bedroom. Along with this well-
developed 
character 
spark 
between Simone and Raymond, 
the film’s presentation of Simone as 
in control of both her blossoming 
bond with Raymond and her life 
overall is unexpected, especially 
within the Netflix romance genre. 
Simone is not the typical life-in-
shambles, quirky trope of a single-
parent woman. She is solid, present 
and invested in her daughter’s 
health and well-being, confident 
in her beauty and she doesn’t 
play into the “woe is me” routine. 
Additionally, with Raymond, there 
is a demonstrated effort to portray 

Simone as the pursuer and driver 
of the relationship. Raymond puts 
his number in her phone. She sends 
the first text, initiates the date on 
her terms and doesn’t play into 
the tired stereotype of the woman 
lying in wait for a text back. And 
it’s refreshing, to say the least. 
While not devoid of charm, 
largely brought on by its sturdy 
characters, the majority of song 
and dance in the film is unnatural 
and forced. Song sequences are 
hastily interjected, preventing the 
development of consistent pace 
or rhythm. In fact, many musical 
numbers are just plain awkward 
and uninvolving, including an 
unwarranted, 
oversexualized 
number from Yvonne and a bizarre 
solo sung by the minor bartender 
figure. Not to mention, the dance 
throughout the film is weak and 
watered-down. 
Whenever 
a 
character begins to sway or jive, it 
is almost as if they know they are 
performing for a MacBook screen, 
not a theater stage. They hold back 
half their effort, afraid to generate 
a real wow factor. The attempts 
to incorporate more characters 
into the musical aspects of the 
film 
draws 
attention 
to 
the 
underdeveloped and uninteresting 
subplots and away from what the 
film should invest its focus on: 
Simone and Raymond. 
It would be unfair to say point-
blank that “Been So Long” isn’t 
worth a watch. With positive 
elements like the energy between 
the 
two 
protagonists 
and 
a 
compelling plot, the movie isn’t 
by any means a flop. However, 
the unavoidable frustration that 
comes with watching this film is 
that, as a film, it is so-so, but as a 
musical on an open stage, filled 
with theatrical zest and pep, 
“Been So Long” could have had the 
potential to shine. 

‘Been So Long’ is a sloppy, 
 
tepid musical romance

Michigan’s offense 
adapting to personnel

Of the countless memorable 
moments 
during 
John 
Beilein’s tenure at Michigan, 
two timeless images stand 
above the rest. They are, of 
course, Trey Burke stepping 
back 
and 
releasing 
an 
inch-perfect shot over the 
outstretched arms of Kansas’ 
Kevin Young in 2013, and 
Jordan Poole, legs spread, 
flailing to the floor at the 
buzzer as his shot propelled 
the Wolverines past Houston 
in last year’s tournament.
There 
are 
plenty 
of 
differences between the two 
shots, 
but 
the 
important 
thing is what the they have 
in common — both came 
from 3-point range. That’s 
not a coincidence — 3-point 
shooting has always been a 
core identity for Beilein’s 
Michigan 
teams.
And 
he’s 
always 
had 
the 
personnel 
to 
match. 
Burke, 
Tim 
Hardaway Jr., 
Derrick Walton 
and 
Moritz 
Wagner, 
all 
of whom rank 
among 
the 
Wolverines’ 
biggest 
stars 
under Beilein, were prolific 
from beyond the arc.
This 
year’s 
team 
is 
completely different. Beyond 
Poole, 
Beilein’s 
biggest 
offensive weapons will be 
junior point guard Zavier 
Simpson, 
redshirt 
junior 
forward Charles Matthews 
and freshman forward Ignas 
Brazdeikis, none of whom 
have proven an ability to 
shoot 
3-pointers 
at 
the 
collegiate level.
“Let’s face it, we lost our 
three top shooters (from last 
year),” Beilein said at his 
first press conference of the 
season. “That’s a lot of threes 
in those three and high-
percentage guys so we have 
to replace that somehow.”
Part 
of 
Michigan’s 
adaptation to its lack of 
3-point 
shooting 
will 
be 
a 
heavy 
reliance 
on 
its 
suffocating 
defense. 
But 
it might also 
do 
something 
unprecedented 
under 
Beilein 
— 
predicate 
its offense on 
getting to the 
basket.
“(Getting) 
downhill, 
I 
think 
that’s 
gonna be our identity right 
now,” said assistant coach 
DeAndre Haynes.
The 
Wolverines 
have 
added new sets on offense to 
better match their personnel. 
Michigan’s 
identity 
may 
center around its defensive 
prowess 
but 
its 
offensive 
talent 
isn’t 
weak, 
just 
different.
Brazdeikis was the team’s 

top 
scorer 
in 
its 
three 
exhibitions 
in 
Spain 
this 
summer. 
He 
flashed 
that 
ability again at Monday’s 
open practice, finishing a 
silky reverse layup through 
traffic on an otherwise quiet 
day.
“Iggy, he’s like a, I don’t 
know what you want to call 
him, 
he’s 
just 
barbaric,” 
Haynes said. “Like he’s just 
one of those dudes that once 
he gets into the paint, he’s 
tough (to) guard.”
Matthews is known as a 
defensive standout but he 
began to display his scoring 
ability last March, when he 
averaged 14.8 points per game 
in the Wolverines’ run to the 
national championship. Even 
in his best offensive stretch 
of the season, he scored by 
getting to the basket and 
hitting short-range jumpers. 
Just four of his 36 made 
baskets 
in 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament 
came 
from 
beyond the arc.
The key to 
Michigan’s 
new offensive 
identity might 
be Simpson. As 
Beilein’s point 
guard, 
the 
offense 
runs 
through him. His offense 
was often criticized last year, 
when he shot just 28.6 percent 
from deep at the point guard 
position — a role previously 
occupied 
by 
Walton 
and 
Burke. But 3-point shooting 
just isn’t Simpson’s game.
“Zavier, he’s one of the best 
guards at getting downhill. 
You 
know, 
everyday 
we 
work on different finishes,” 
Haynes said. “If we can get 
him a little 15-footer pull-up, 
that would be great.
“But right now, everything 
with a floater — or we call it 
a three o’clock, nine o’clock 
finish at the wide layups 
— he’s probably one of the 
best guards I’ve seen finish 
those types of layups in the 
country.”
Beilein admits his team’s 
3-point 
shooting 
needs 
to 
improve. 
The 
subject 
has 
dominated 
pre-season 
headlines.
He 
also 
knows 
that 
this 
offense 
is unlike any 
other 
that 
he 
has 
had 
at 
Michigan. 
And 
that 
might 
mean 
venturing into 
uncharted 
territory.
“That’s 
the 
genius 
of 
coach Beilein,” said assistant 
coach 
Saddi 
Washington. 
“He’s always tweaking the 
offense to the strength of 
the 
personnel, 
whether 
it’s our shooting, whether 
it’s our guys’ ability to get 
downhill, coach is masterful 
at adjusting the offense so 
that it’s the strength of our 
personnel.”

EVAN AARON/Daily
Charles Matthews made four 3-pointers in the NCAA Tournament last year. 

Michigan prepares for exhibition on Friday

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
will 
look 
to shed some offseason rust 
before it officially begins its 
season next Friday, Nov. 9, with 
an exhibition game tomorrow 
against Findlay University.
Led by senior forward Anna 
Hintz, the Oilers – a Division 
II program – are coming off 
of a 22-8 season which ended 
in defeat in the first round of 
the Division II Tournament. 
Hintz, 
who 
was 
Findlay’s 
leading scorer last season after 
averaging 18.4 points per game, 
will pose a preseason test 
for the Wolverines’ forwards 
– good preparation for the 
season to come. 
For Michigan, this game 
will be a test run to see how 
they can adjust to life after 
Katelynn Flaherty (22.9 points 
per game), who graduated last 
year as the most prolific scorer 
in program history. 
“Losing 
Katelynn 
… 
is 
a 
tremendous 
loss,” 
said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico during the Wolverines’ 
media day, Oct. 10. “But our 
program is in a tremendous 
spot and I am super excited 
about the team that we have 
right now.” 
Barnes Arico will primarily 
look to senior center Hallie 
Thome 
and 
senior 
guard 
Nicole 
Munger 
–Michigan’s 
second and third 
leading 
scorers 
from last season 
at 17.4 and 9.1 
points per game, 
respectively 
– to fill in for 
Flaherty on the 
offensive 
end 
this coming season. 
Thome, who is 6-foot-5, 
should find success against 
the smaller Oilers in this 
exhibition matchup, as the 

only Findlay player taller than 
6-foot-2 is center Sydney Kin, 
a 6-foot-3 freshman without a 
minute of college experience. 
Going forward, Barnes Arico 
will 
place 
a 
heavy workload 
on 
Thome’s 
and 
Munger’s 
shoulders, 
but 
she also expects 
this year’s team 
to not rely on 
any one player 
nearly as much 
as it did last 
year 
with 
Flaherty.
“(Thome) is going to have 
a great senior season, as well 
as Nicole Munger,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Those two are 
leading the way with their 

leadership and their skill, but 
our junior class has improved 
tremendously; our sophomore 
class is playing with a ton of 
confidence. … Our freshman 
class, it’s been the 
highest-ranked 
class in program 
history.”
Of 
all 
the 
highly-heralded 
freshmen, guard 
Amy 
Dilk 
will 
play 
the 
most 
significant early 
role as she is set to 
replace Flaherty 
at 
point 
guard 
and will get the opportunity to 
show why she was a five-star 
recruit.
The Findlay game will give 
Barnes Arico a final glimpse of 

Dilk before the season’s start 
and allow her to correct any 
flaws she may have ahead of 
their first regular season game.
“(Dilk) is going to be our 
point 
guard 
and 
she’s 
a 
freshman, 
and 
that’s 
a 
big role for a 
freshman,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“But 
I 
think 
she’s 
capable 
of 
handling that 
(role).”
While 
the 
game against the Oilers will 
not count for anything in the 
stat book, it does mean one very 
important 
thing: 
Michigan 
basketball is back.

Finding a rhythm
I

f one 
thing 
is cer-
tain after 
the Michi-
gan hockey 
team’s first 
five games, 
it’s that 
Wolverines 
coach Mel 
Pearson 
and his team are doing more 
than just trying to kill bad 
habits — they’re actively look-
ing for rhythm and routine.
Look at Michigan’s series 
against St. Lawrence, for 
example. Sure, the Saints 
aren’t nearly at the same 
level that the Wolverines are, 
but Michigan came into the 
series with concrete issues 
it wanted to work on — and 
executed.
After a series against West-
ern Michigan where the Wol-
verines accumulated 12 total 
penalties, Pearson and some 
players mentioned that they 
strived to be one of the least 
penalized teams in the coun-
try. Michigan responded with 
just three penalties in 120 
minutes of ice time against 
St. Lawrence, and through 
the season, only have 18 total 
penalties to their opponents’ 
34.
Having that stability has 
also helped the Wolverines 
stay disciplined with the 
puck. While Michigan was 
plagued with untimely turn-
overs deep in the defensive 
zone in both games against 
Western Michigan, the 
Wolverines significantly 
cut those down against St. 
Lawrence. Likewise, when 
sophomore defenseman 
Quinn Hughes saw the Saints 
clogging the ice near the goal 
on Saturday, having that puck 
discipline kept him attacking 
from the left side of the zone, 
and he points three times.
The Wolverines have a few 
different options to keep that 
rhythm on a day-to-day level. 
Players have the option to 
see a sports psychologist to 

help them stay sharp over the 
course of a game.
“Some guys just need to 
relax and take a nap,” Pear-
son said. “Other guys need to 
keep active and stay busy… 
The thing that 
we’ve learned 
over the years 
is that you’ve 
gotta find a 
routine. Get in 
the routine that 
works for you, 
to not only be 
ready physi-
cally, but men-
tally as well, 
and be prepared 
to play.”
Another part of that new-
found rhythm may well be 
because of continued chemis-
try. Michigan has seemingly 
settled in on a top front line 
of sophomore forward Josh 

Norris and junior forwards 
Will Lockwood and Jake 
Slaker. On Friday night Norris 
and Slaker each assisted each 
other on goals, accounting for 
two of the team’s three goals 
that night. It 
might not be 
the “DMC” 
line from last 
year, but set-
tling in on 
these combina-
tions early will 
serve the Wol-
verines well.
Lockwood, 
of all people, 
knows the 
importance of finding a rou-
tine since he himself hasn’t 
had much of an opportunity 
to do so after suffering a sea-
son-ending injury last year.
“I’ve kind of gotten in a 
routine for things,” Lock-

wood said. “I like to stay 
relaxed and loose through-
out the day… once you enter 
the rink it’s all intense, and 
you’re not really thinking 
about anything else besides 
the game … Personally I’ll 
come to the rink, take my 
stick right away and then go 
out.”
Establishing a groove is 
important because Michigan 
is no stranger to slow starts — 
last year the Wolverines were 
under .500 as late as January 
— and time will tell if Michi-
gan can find another groove.
If the St. Lawrence series 
is any indication, the Wolver-
ines are off to a good start in 
that regard.

Eli Brooks looking for 
increased role this year

Eli Brooks’ phone rang, and 
DeAndre Haynes was on the 
other end.
Haynes, an assistant coach on 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team, called Brooks to give the 
sophomore guard a little extra 
boost before the season.
“Man, I’m proud of you,” 
Haynes said. “Just keep doing 
what you’re doing, keep being 
a great leader and keep playing 
with confidence.”
It would be easy for Brooks to 
lose the faith. At the start of last 
year, the point guard position 
was one of the Wolverines’ 
most pressing questions, and 
for a time, Brooks looked like he 
could be the answer. He earned 
the starting job in November, 
but had lost it by January.
Brooks 
faded 
into 
the 
background 
as 
then-
sophomore 
Zavier 
Simpson 
broke out on defense. He was 
eclipsed as backup point guard 
by fifth-year senior Jaaron 
Simmons and backup shooting 
guard by freshman Jordan 
Poole. By February, Brooks 
was averaging less than five 
minutes a game.
This year will be different. 
Brooks knows he won’t have 
a starting role, with Simpson 
and Poole firmly entrenched 
at the ‘1’ and ‘2,’ respectively. 
But Brooks has a different 
perspective, an improved game 
and with it, a clearer path to 
more playing time.
“He handled it last year 
really well and … he got 
chances to go back on the scout 
team and really get reps,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“And he’s been one of our best 
players this fall.”
Brooks’ experience with the 
scout team led him to take more 
of a leadership role among the 
freshmen, especially forward 
Ignas Brazdeikis and guard 
David DeJulius — something 
he didn’t do last year. He has 

never been very vocal, but 
with Simpson’s fiery “bulldog” 
personality, he doesn’t need to 
be.
Instead, Brooks leads by 
example. 
Frequently, 
he 
stays after practice with the 
freshmen, teaching them the 
finer points of the game. It helps 
them, but it also helps him.
“It’s just his confidence,” 
Haynes said. “He’s just been a 
great teammate. I was telling 
someone earlier, the things 
(guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman) was doing with him 
last year and doing with the 
team, you see him doing.”
During his time on the bench, 
Brooks learned the importance 
of confidence — something 
that has increased with his 
leadership. Beilein and Haynes 
have noticed the difference, 
and the improvements that 
have come along with it.
Beilein praised Brooks for 
shooting the ball as well as any 
Wolverine. Haynes mentioned 
him as one of Michigan’s best 
defenders — high praise for a 
player on one of the country’s 
best defensive teams. If those 
changes show up in games, 
other teams will start to notice, 
too.
“We don’t know if he’ll back 
up at the point, play more of the 
‘2,’ I don’t know what,” Beilein 
said. “But he’s gonna be on the 
court.”
After last year, Brooks could 
have given up and resigned 
himself to a diminished role. 
Instead, he recognized his 
unique position to help other 
players improve — and carved 
out a place for himself in the 
process. And no matter what 
position he plays this year, 
Brooks knows he has a lot to 
offer, on and off the court.
“Just 
maintaining 
your 
confidence, cause that’s one of 
the biggest things I learned,” 
Brooks said. “You’re gonna 
have highs and lows, but just 
being able to limit the lows is 
one way to stay on top.”

From PSU to PSU, Kwity Paye filling potential

Last season’s matchup with 
Penn State is one that many 
Wolverines have tried not to 
forget.
The 
Nittany 
Lions 
embarrassed 
the 
Michigan 
football team, 42-13, and went so 
far as trying to score late in the 
game when they could have just 
run out the clock.
Defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown has said he wakes up every 
morning and thinks about that 
game. His players have echoed 
that sentiment.
For sophomore defensive end 
Kwity Paye, though, the memory 
is a little bit different. Sure, he 
wants revenge against Penn 
State just like any of the other 
Wolverines. But in last year’s 
game, when things got out of 
hand and the starters subbed out, 
Paye showed his capability. He 
finished with three tackles — one 
for a loss — and assisted on a sack, 
which was the first of his career. 
That gave a glimpse of what could 

be expected from him when he 
rose to the top of the depth chart.
“It was exciting last year, 
finally getting my first sack,” 
Paye said on Tuesday. “But this 
year, you know, trying to get some 
more sacks, obviously. You know, 
just trying to get that new page 
and just keep working.”
With junior defensive end 
Rashan Gary sidelined the last 
three games due to injury, Paye 
has gotten another opportunity, 
and he has gotten more sacks. 
Two, to be exact.
More importantly, though, the 
Michigan defense hasn’t missed 
a beat with Gary’s absence. Paye 
has filled in for him seamlessly.
“When I found out I was going 
to be starting the Maryland 
game, I was a little nervous. I was 
a little on the edge,” Paye said. 
“(Gary) was just like, ‘Don’t be 
nervous. You’ve been doing this. 
You’ve been working throughout 
two camps, and you know what 
you’re doing, so just go out there 
and play your game.’ ”
Paye says he finally relieved 
himself of his nerves after the 

Wisconsin game. In his words, 
the Badgers’ offensive line was 
“big as hell,” and once he and 
the Wolverines defense hung 
in against them, he knew he 
belonged.
“After I played with them, I 
was like, I can hang,” Paye said. 
“After that, I just started going 
out and playing my game.”
That might mean more than 
just his play.
The Rhode Island native is 
admittedly 
quiet, 
something 
his 
teammates 
corroborate. 
But against Michigan State last 
week, Paye came out of his shell. 
Maybe it was the rivalry and 
the emotions surrounding that 
particular game, or maybe it’s the 
growing self-confidence, but Paye 
began talking trash on the field, 
as Michigan held the Spartans to 
94 total yards.
“Kwity is a really quiet person 
until something happens,” said 
sophomore defensive tackle Carlo 
Kemp. “Then you look over, like, 
‘That was Kwity doing that?’ 
So, you know, it’s fun getting to 
see when Kwity brings out his 

personality. He does that on the 
field a lot.”
So what exactly does that look 
like?
“All you see come out of Kwity 
is his teeth,” Kemp said.
Added Paye: “Usually I don’t 
like to talk a lot. But that game, 
we were jawing at each other, us 
and the offensive linemen, so it 
was real fun.”
In 
the 
end, 
though, 
the 
burgeoning personality is a side 
piece, and possibly a product of 
what really matters. If you had 
told Wolverines fans before the 
season that they would have to 
face the Badgers and Michigan 
State without Gary, there would 
have been concern.
But 
Michigan’s 
defense 
dominated both offenses. With 
the 14th-ranked Nittany Lions 
coming into town, Gary still 
might not be healthy enough to 
play. And yet the Wolverines are 
double-digit favorites.
That is, in part, because Paye 
has followed through on the 
potential he showed a year ago in 
Happy Valley.

Sophomore defensive end Kwity Paye got his first career sack against Penn State last season, and since then, he has developed into a solid option on the line.

Saturday’s game is for Don Brown
I

t’s been well publicized 
at this point that Don 
Brown thinks about last 
year’s 42-13 
loss to Penn 
State every 
day. That’s 
376 days 
replaying the 
deepest stain 
on his three 
years at 
Michigan.
The 506 
yards and 42 
points the 
Nittany Lions put up exposed 
his seemingly impervious 
scheme. Recently, Brown 
showed the defensive players 
a clip of Penn State going 
for another gut-punching 
touchdown as time expired 
last season. With part of his 
memory reserved for that 
game, he didn’t need the 
extra motivation. His players 
probably didn’t either.
“We still remember, 
fourth quarter, five seconds 
left in the game, they had 
their players in, they ran a 
last play,” said sophomore 
defensive end Kwity Paye. 
“So we put that in our back 
pocket and we just remember 
that every single day as 
we’re working that they 
disrespected us.”
For a defensive coordinator 
that Jim Harbaugh called 
“one of the all-time great 
football coaches in the history 
of the game,” this weekend’s 
game is reclamation of that 
description. 
Saturday, whether the 
outcome is good or bad, is for 
Don Brown.
The 63-year-old walked 
through the door Wednesday 
afternoon with a spry jaunt to 
meet with the media.
“Happy Halloween,” he said 
to the scrum. “What are you 
dressing up as?”
In response to junior safety 
Josh Metellus calling him an 
“old man,” Brown says he’s 

dressing as a younger version 
of himself, though his black 
sweater and khakis suggested 
he wasn’t in costume yet.
And therein lies Brown’s 
mystique. Behind a mustache, 
Boston accent 
and story-
filled wrinkles, 
Brown is 
chipper with 
no signs of 
restlessness. He 
is coaching one 
of the biggest 
games of his 
lengthy career 
— Big Ten 
Championship 
and College Football Playoff 
implications at stake — and he 
remains measured and funny 
with his answers.
“That’s what happens in 
41 years — you win some 
battles, some you’re not gonna 

win. But at the end of the 
day, you’ve gotta get better,” 
Brown said. “The thing that 
drives me is when I don’t give 
our players the best possible 
chance. I want to make sure I 
remind myself 
of that. … At 
the same time, 
you’ve gotta 
move on and 
learn from it. 
Make sure you 
have all the 
tools in the 
toolbox at your 
disposal. Don’t 
say ‘Ah, we’re 
good without 
that.’ ”
Brown won’t tell you what’s 
in his toolbox this year that 
wasn’t last year, because he 
is still implementing it in 
his stalwart defense. But his 
defense is smarter and more 

trustworthy, they can talk on 
more defensive concepts and 
be better at it.
“You have to have a cerebral 
approach,” Brown said. “I was 
looking at third-down stuff, 
we repeated 
a bunch of 
stuff on third 
down against 
Michigan State 
two weeks ago. 
But you go back 
beyond that — 
Northwestern, 
Nebraska, 
just going 
back — there’s 
somewhere 
about 65 different concepts 
that we’ve challenged 
opposing offenses with.”
And then, Brown gets asked 
how he knows his players love 
football. In other words, how 
does a football guy recognize 

another football guy?
“You can’t come here and 
play football here and not love 
football because it’s too much 
a part of your DNA,” Brown 
said. “This isn’t Happy Jack 
City. You better 
like football, 
and you better 
like the things 
that go into it.”
He hasn’t 
even discussed 
this year’s Penn 
State team yet. 
That doesn’t 
happen until 
12 minutes into 
an 18-minute 
conversation, and lasts two 
minutes.
He likes quarterback Trace 
McSorley, wide receivers K.J. 
Hamler and Juwan Johnson, 
running back Miles Sanders 
and tight end Pat Freiermuth. 

It’s a listicle of the primary 
weapons that Michigan’s 
defense will see from the 
Nittany Lions.
Then, it’s back to his 
unit and its most recent 
performance: allowing just 94 
yards to Michigan State.
“Just relief for another 
week,” Brown said of his 
reaction. “I’ll share something 
with you — that didn’t 
surprise me. This team, this 
defensive football team that 
we’re coaching presently, is 
the best practice team I’ve 
ever been around. I don’t have 
to out there with my hair 
on fire, screaming on guys, 
‘You’ve gotta hustle, you’ve 
gotta run, get to the ball, blah 
blah blah.’ This team practices 
like they’re supposed to 
practice.”
Don Brown could just be 
doing Don Brown things and 
complimenting his guys. But 
even when poked and prodded 
for answers, he didn’t dwell 
for too long on last year and 
what he is preparing for this 
year.
He’s felt accountable for 
over a year about last season’s 
blowout, and shares that 
feeling with his players. Of 
course that’s what he wants 
to talk about. His defense is 
fourth in points allowed and 
first in yards allowed per 
game, after all.
On Saturday, a replication 
of last year’s nightmare 
can undo all of this year’s 
accomplishments and 
squander a hopeful season. 
Or Brown and his players can 
turn the table and keep title 
dreams intact.
“Happy Halloween,” Brown 
repeated with a smile as he 
finished his press conference.
The mental weight of 376 
frustrating days were nowhere 
be seen.

Michigan defensive coordinator Don Brown says he has thought about last season’s Penn State game every day since the Wolverines lost, 42-13.

“But at the 
end of the day, 
you’ve gotta get 
better.”

“This isn’t 
Happy Jack 
City. You better 
like football.”
