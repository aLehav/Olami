Ann Arbor City Council met 

Monday evening to discuss 
topics 
including 
pedestrian 

safety and crosswalk policies, a 
millage to fund the Washtenaw 
County Mental Health and 
Sheriff 
departments, 
and 

suicide prevention in the city’s 
parking structures. 

Discussion 
on 
pedestrian 

safety began during the public 
commentary 
period 
at 
the 

beginning 
of 
the 
meeting. 

Several local residents brought 
up concerns about crosswalk 
safety in Ann Arbor.

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 

Stephanie Preston, leader of 
local 
organization 
A2 
Safe 

Transport, stressed the need 
for a new crosswalk near 
Community High School at 
the corner of North 5th and 
Detroit streets. All crosswalks 
normally 
utilized 
in 
the 

immediate area are unusable 
due to construction.

“We’ve been working with the 

city and with Community High 
School to figure out a solution,” 
Preston 
said. 
“Currently 

there’s a DDA (Downtown 
Development 
Authority) 

project in Kerrytown, adjacent 
to Community … this will 
promise to be a great project; 
however, it will take all year. 
In the meantime, there is no 
safe way for these students 
to get to school. … It’s a very 
tricky intersection, we get that. 

There’s only one location where 
they could get across safely 
and we know that the city can 
prioritize having some safe 
options.”

Citizens also raised general 

concerns 
about 
crosswalks. 

Jared Hoffert, current Ward 2 
City Council candidate, voiced 
his worries that a review of 
the city’s current pedestrian 
crossing policies would lead to 
its abolishment.

“I would like to express my 

sincere desire that any review 
of this law is with an eye 
toward further education of its 
specifics to the residents of Ann 
Arbor, both pedestrians and 
motorists alike,” Hoffert said. 
“Ann Arbor has always been 
a city that values pedestrian 
safety and our laws need to 
reflect this value.”

Later in the meeting during 

an additional public comment 

session Soraya Streeter, Ann 
Arbor resident and Skyline 
High School student, and her 
friend turned attention back to 
the need for a crosswalk near 
Community High School.

“We 
both 
have 
friends 

and my little sister goes to 
Community,” 
Streeter 
said. 

“We’re 
concerned 
because 

they seem to be the type that 
wear all black. … My sister has 

The University of Michigan 

is used to winning competitions 
in 
various 
schools 
and 

departments, but the one it’s 
entering now isn’t exactly about 
academics.

Instead, University President 

Mark Schlissel is calling upon 
students to take part in a Big 
Ten Conference competition 
to help increase voter turnout 
rates.

“I invite you to take part 

and help the University of 
Michigan – and our society 
– win,” Schlissel wrote in an 
email circulated to the entire 
University community Sunday 
morning, 
focusing 
on 
the 

importance of voter turnout. 
This comes as no surprise as 
the state is approaching the 
2018 midterm election cycle 
next academic year.

Over 
the 
course 
of 
the 

next year, the Big Ten Voting 
Challenge will take place across 
all 14 universities within the 
Big Ten Conference, ending 
with the results of turnout rates 
among students for the 2018

In 
response 
to 
several 

recent incidents of racism on 
the University of Michigan 
campus and throughout Ann 
Arbor, students and faculty 
hung up posters with phrases 
of solidarity and support for 
targeted groups Monday night.

“You are loved, valued, and 

important. Hatred has no place 
here. The Michigan community 
stands with you,” a poster read.

Sunday 
morning, 
three 

Black students in the Michigan

This 
summer, 
South 

University 
Avenue 
was 

characterized as a frenzy 
of 
construction. 
Several 

different projects, including 
the building of new sidewalks 
and new apartment buildings, 
have still been in the works 
since classes let out last April.

LSA 
sophomore 
Josie 

Junkin, a University Towers 
resident, 
was 
especially 

bothered by the construction 
while moving in this August.

“Moving in, it was pretty 

hard to find parking spots,” 
Junkin said. “And walking 
to class, we’ve had to walk 
in the street which is pretty 
inconvenient.”

The sidewalk restructuring 

project, 
which 
is 
a 

collaboration 
between 

the city of Ann Arbor and 
the Ann Arbor Downtown 
Development 
Authority, 

was the first of the projects 
to start, and will be the 

first to wrap up. Because 
of the construction, South 
University Avenue was closed 
to 
two-way 
traffic 
from 

East University Avenue to 
Washtenaw Avenue.

The 
roads 
were 
slated 

to reopen last Friday, but 
at the time of publication 
South University Avenue is 
still blocked off from East 
University Avenue to Church 
Street.

According to Amber Miller, 

a planner from the Ann Arbor 
DDA, the sidewalk repairs 
were much needed. The last 
time they had been updated 
was in the 1980s, and Miller 
said it was starting to show.

“The sidewalk was in really 

bad shape, the trees were 
dying, so that was our first 
priority,” Miller said. “But 
we’ve also been able to put in a 
rain garden to deal with some 
standing water issues, we’re 
able to expand the sidewalk to 
reduce the crossing distance. 
There’s more space on the 
sidewalk for cafes and seating,

Proposed 2018 fiscal budget will decrease access to funds, necessary child care

For 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 

undergraduate students at the 
University of Michigan’s Ann Arbor 
campus, the prospect of raising a 
family is remote –– something they 
do not imagine doing for another 
several years, or at least until 
they graduate. According to Amy 
Szczepanski, campus child care 
homes network manager for Work 
Life Resource Center, there are only 
57 undergraduates receiving a child 

care subsidy through the Office of 
Financial Aid — though the total 
number of undergraduate parents is 
likely slightly higher.

For more than 4.8 million 

college students across the country, 
however, leading a double life as 
a student-parent — or, factoring 
in work, a triple life — is their 
reality. The time they spend on 
child care makes them less likely to 
graduate on time or at all, and their 
responsibilities as a student force 
them to sacrifice time with their 
children.

And neither child care nor 

higher education are uncostly. With 
what little time they have between 
the two commitments, student-
parents often must work just to 
keep themselves afloat; according 
to reports from Young Invincibles, 
25 percent of student-parents live 
below the federal poverty line, 
and according to the Institute 
for 
Women’s 
Policy 
Research, 

88 percent of student-parents at 
community colleges live below 200 
percent of that.
Child Care Access Means Parents 
in School

One 
of 
the 
few 
programs 

working to address the urgency of 
student-parent needs is Child Care 
Access Means Parents in School, a 
federal competitive grant program 
managed by the Department of 
Education that awards grants to 
colleges and universities intended 
to support or establish campus-
based child care programs for low-
income student-parents.

Funded at about $15 million per 

year, the program is small compared 
to the size of the Department of 
Education’s budget, and, serving 
approximately 5,000 students, the

A new universal-access playground was 

unveiled at Ann Arbor’s Gallup Park this 
weekend. Named the Rotary Centennial 
Playground, the space is open and accessible to 
all people, regardless of age or ability.

The project, which has been in the works 

since 2013, is a $1.1 million addition to Gallup 
Park. The Rotary Club of Ann Arbor donated 
$550,000 to make the playground a reality. 
Collyer Smith, president of the organization, 
told MLive that the playground aims to bring 
people together in its accessibility.

“It is for people of all abilities and all ages,” 

Collyer said. “It’s not just for kids. It’s not just 
for disabled people. It’s not just for disabled 
kids. It is for people of all abilities and all ages 
to play together.”

Colin Smith, director of the Ann Arbor 

Parks and Recreation Services, echoed the 
Rotary Club’s sentiments.

“It’s for the child and for the caregiver 

too, or the parent, so everyone can be involved 
in every aspect of it,” Colin said. “I hope it 
continues to be a place where people can come 
together and enjoy together and to grow and 
play.”

According to ClickOn Detroit, more 

than 100 people attended Sunday’s ribbon-
cutting ceremony, where Ann Arbor Mayor 
Christopher Taylor gave a statement.

“Ann Arbor is beautiful because of who we 

are and what we do,” Taylor told the crowd.

The playground is centered around a fairy 

theme, with different play structures to make 
players feel as if they’re in woodlands, rivers or 
prairies. The structures encourage cooperative 
play and are handicap-
accessible.

The city said it was 

thrilled with the way the 
playground turned out. Ann 
Arbor Parks and Recreation 
Services tweeted a photo 
of the ribbon-cutting 
ceremony, writing, “We 
could not have asked for a 
better outcome from this 
collaboration.”

Although this 

playground is already a great 
success, Hillary Hanzel, 
one of the project heads and 
landscape architects, told 
ClickOn Detroit there won’t 

be any others like it in Ann Arbor any time 
soon.

“(No other plans) for a playground of this 

size, scope and cost — this one is unique!” 
Hanzel said. “As we make improvements 
to other Ann Arbor Park playgrounds the 
principle of universal accessibility is certainly 
considered and a goal we strive for.”

and just overall a more pleasant 
experience.”

Although the project was 

finished this weekend, DDA 
project manager Liz Rolla said 
there are a few final additions 
that still need to happen. 
Maintenance will also occur 
regularly to keep the area 
looking nice.

“We’re still going to come 

back sometime this fall and 
update the lighting, so put 
basically new lamps in the 
existing ground holes,” Rolla 
said. “And there’s some upkeep 
with the landscaping, so every 
now and then you’ll see people 
watering, weeding, stuff like 
that.”

Rolla said there should be no 

need to close the roads again 
while this upkeep is going on, 
though street parking may be 
blocked off for short periods of 
time.

New high-rise apartments 

are also slated to be built in 
the South University Avenue 

area. The lot at 1107 South 
University Ave. will house the 
Collegian North building when 
completed. Brett Lenart, Ann 
Arbor’s 
planning 
manager, 

wrote in an email interview 
that proposals for 1209 and 
1215 South University Ave. were 
submitted last year, but neither 
has received approval from the 
city yet.

“For 1107 (South) University, 

I would anticipate about 2 years 
of construction once it starts,” 
Lenart wrote. “The others will 
depend on the owners time to 
submit and revise plans, receive 
necessary 
approvals, 
and 

commence construction.” 

Lenart is optimistic about 

the impact these new buildings 
could have on the University 
of Michigan community. He 
thinks these new buildings 
will draw new commerce to the 
area.

“I 
think 
that 
adding 

student-oriented 
residential 

is a great opportunity for this 
area, 
allowing 
students 
to 

live practically on campus, 
potentially without need for a 
vehicle,” he wrote. “I think it 
will be interesting to see how 

the retail in the area evolves 
with the addition of more 
residential units in that area. 
Adding units, or “rooftops” in 
market analysis speak, typically 
increases 
the 
viability 
of 

commercial uses.”

According to the building 

plan for the Collegian North, 
the ground floor of the building 
will be dedicated to retail space.

Councilwoman 
Julie 

Grand, D-Ward 3, has heard 
some 
concern 
from 
her 

residents about the way the 
new 
projects 
are 
changing 

the character of the district. 
She said her residents are 
nevertheless mostly unaffected 
by the construction and new 
development.

“There are certainly some 

residents who don’t like them 
from an aesthetic point of view, 
but because of how they impact 
their daily life because they 
are so close to campus, it’s not 
much of a concern,” Grand said. 
“If there’s any concern, it’s over 
the character of the district ... 
not over the quality of life.”

Still, the opinions of Grand’s 

residents will be something 
the city must deal with in 

the coming years as more 
development occurs.

Students, on the other 

hand, are divided as to 
whether 
they 
think 
the 

changes on South University 
Avenue are beneficial. Many 
were outraged when they 
first heard of plans to build 
more high-rise apartments 
in the area. Public Policy 
senior, CSG Vice President, 
Nadine Jawad has spent her 
years in student government 
advocating 
for 
affordable 

student 
housing. 
In 
an 

interview with the Daily 
last spring Jawad said it 
comes down to an issue of 
equity and that she plans to 
use her position in student 
government to ensure Ann 
Arbor 
is 
accessible 
and 

affordable for all. Others, like 
Junkin, are ambivalent to the 
change.

“It doesn’t bother me,” 

Junkin said. “I don’t know if 
I would notice a difference, 
but it would be interesting. 
It would be nice, I guess, to 
have more places to eat and 
stuff.”

breadth of its impact is similar.

For those 5,000, the benefits are 

life-changing. Quisha and Byron 
Cooper have been working toward 
degrees at Ferris State University 
in Big Rapids, Mich., for four years, 
while raising children since their 
sophomore 
year. 
Without 
the 

program, the Coopers say, they 
wouldn’t have been able to go to 
college at all.

“To us, the grant is humongous, 

because it’s literally how we live our 
lives and how we’re able to function 
and go to school and work and still 
have affordable, reliable daycare,” 
Quisha said. “Before I had children, 
I was always goal-oriented and 
wanted to obtain a degree and go 
to school for social work. So yeah, 
there was a time when we didn’t 
participate in the grant, but it wasn’t 
a time that I want to go back to.”

However, 
that 
could 
all 

disappear with the passage of the 
next federal appropriations bill, 
likely to be passed by both chambers 
of Congress in late September. 
According to documents obtained 
by The Washington Post, the 
budgets proposed by the Trump 
administration and the House of 
Representatives for the upcoming 
fiscal year cancel funding for 
CCAMPIS, as well as several other 
higher education programs.

Colin 
Seeberger, 
strategic 

campaigns 
director 
at 
Young 

Invincibles –– a policy and advocacy 
nonprofit for young adults that 
works with students in CCAMPIS 
–– 
said 
he 
was 
particularly 

disappointed by the news given the 
history of bipartisan support for the 
program.

“Senator Susan Collins and 

her 
former 
colleague 
Senator 

Olympia Snowe, both of whom 
are 
Republicans, 
formerly 

were co-sponsors of CCAMPIS 
reauthorization bills,” Seeberger 
said. “That’s something that hasn’t 
really been questioned before, 
whether it was something that had 
the support of Republicans and 
Democrats. We would hope that 
it would not and this would not 
become as partisan of a program.”

In its budget proposal, the 

Trump administration justified the 
elimination of the program, saying 
“subsidizing expenses associated 
with child care is not consistent 
with 
the 
Department’s 
core 

mission.”

But Seeberger disagrees.
“Helping students get in, access 

and complete school has always 
been part of the mission at the 
Department of Education, so that 
was kind of alarming,” he said.

Far from cutting the program, 

Seeberger thinks it should be 
expanded 
to 
a 
$500 
million 

program 
via 
grant 
matching, 

with $250 million coming from 
the federal government and the 
other $250 million coming from 
matching funds from states and 
higher 
education 
institutions. 

Doing that, he argues, would allow 
the program to serve 250,000 
student-parents living in poverty. 
As it is now, he said, the program 
meets the needs of the students it 
serves, “but doesn’t actually meet 
the scale of the challenges we’re 
seeing.”

And while there are plenty 

of other government programs 
in need of funding, Seeberger 
points out each dollar going 
toward CCAMPIS has additional 
effect because of the program’s 
“multigenerational 
impact.” 
He 

said he’s had students who say 
the grant brings what would be a 
thousand-dollar monthly child care 
bill down to $150 per semester.

“You can imagine, when you’re a 

student-parent and you’re focused 
on your studies, maybe you’re 
working a full-time or part-time 
job but still raising a child — that 
extra $900 a month can be all the 
difference in the world of being 
able to buy your textbooks, being 
able to feed your family, being able 
to — for that matter — stay in school 
and take on less student debt,” he 
said. “You’re getting that much 
more bang for your buck, ensuring 
that kids are growing up in more 
economically stable family units as 
well.”

The Coopers attest to this 

emphatically, saying they now feel 
confident in the environment in 
which their children are growing 
up. And more than just being 
safe and affordable, they say 
CCAMPIS creates an atmosphere 
that is uniquely enriching for their 
children.

“If this grant was cut, we would 

probably have to go back to working 
full-time and maybe cut education 
out for a while. So our kids probably 
wouldn’t grow up in the same 
atmosphere that they are in right 
now, because right now we do this 
on campus in student housing, they 
have a very rich cultural setting 
around, just as far as the diversity,” 
Quisha Cooper said. “Literally, our 
children grow up on the campus 
of Ferris State University and get 
a huge experience and a different 
outlook that kids their age don’t 
often get just going to a regular 
daycare or just staying at home.”

According to Byron, they never 

had any difficulty enrolling in the 
program and it never caused them 
any confusion. If they keep their 
GPAs above 2.5, he explained, then 
Ferris State covers half the cost 
of their child care. Above a 3.0, it 
covers 75 percent, and above a 3.5 
all expenses are covered.

“Our daycare facility pretty 

much helped us out with that a 
lot,” he said. “So it wasn’t a difficult 
process to sign up for at all. We 
just filled out a form or so, and our 
daycare provider did the rest.”
Child care at the University

And while the grant is not big 

enough for everyone who would 
like to use it, some institutions have 
taken the CCAMPIS model and 
made it their own. The University’s 
Ann Arbor campus was a CCAMPIS 
grant recipient until 2005, but 
stopped pursuing federal funding 
because the program was targeted 
mainly toward undergraduates, 
rather than graduate students.

Since 
2005, 
though, 
the 

University has been funding its 
own program, now known as 
the Campus Child Care Homes 
Network. 
Functioning 
as 
a 

complement to the University’s 
three 
main 
children’s 
centers 

serving 
faculty, 
students 
and 

staff, Campus Child Care Homes 
is now a collection of 11 homes in 
Northwood Family Housing that 
provide daycare for about 150 
children. Recruited and trained by 
the University and licensed by the 
state, students’ spouses often care 
for other children alongside their 
own.

Jennie McAlpine, director for 

the Work-Life Resources Program 
at the University, said the shift from 
federal to University funding was a 
natural transition.

“Around the time the grant was 

about to run out, we looked at things 
differently and we thought that 
capping it to experienced and long-
running child care providers in the 
community would be a good way to 
go; it would be very stable and work 
for a very long time,” she said. “And 
at that time, we just began, once 
we secured funding here from the 
University, we just began to make 
that our focus, and now we have 11 
campus child care homes which are 

state-licensed, home-based child 
care centers for University families, 
and we count those child care 
spaces for any affiliates: Students, 
or staff or faculty.”

And, 
according 
to 
Amy 

Szczepanski, 
the 
homes 
are 

preferable over the larger children’s 
centers for a variety of reasons.

“They, in their agreement with 

us, we help them by providing 
support for training and equipping 
and improving their homes, so it 
provides another more than 150 
spaces 
available 
to 
University 

families that often accommodate 
more flexible hours, that are a 
little bit less expensive than our 
children’s centers, they have more 
room for infants than our children’s 
centers,” she said.

Veronica Varela, a Rackham 

student currently working toward 
her Ph.D. in neuroscience, has two 
daughters aged 9 and 12. She said 
the University’s child care stipend 
and flexible child care program 
options were one of the main 
factors in her decision to come here.

While child care is still a major 

concern for her, it is less so than it 
used to be, as her children are of age 
to enroll in public school. It wasn’t 
always that way, though. Varela 
started her undergraduate degree 
at California State University at 
San Bernardino almost a decade 
ago, when her youngest was only 6 
months old. The only reason college 
was a possibility for her –– then a 
single mom, though she got married 
two years ago –– was the college’s 
CCAMPIS program.

“Because 
of 
the 
CCAMPIS 

program I was able to have the girls 
in preschool and daycare from 8 
to 5. And I could utilize that time 
in between classes to actually 
study, because as soon as I got 
home, there was no time to study. 
I never would’ve been able to pass 
my classes, I never would’ve even 

been able to go to college if I didn’t 
have that funding,” she said. “Only 
because I had that funding and 
because I had a safe place for my 
girls to be was I able to be successful 
enough to come to the University of 
Michigan.”

Being a student-parent, Varela 

said, she still feels guilty about 
having to split time between her 
education and her children –– and 
occasionally having to take them 
to lectures with her when they get 
too sick to go to school or daycare. 
However, CCAMPIS has made it 
worthwhile for both Varela and her 
children.

“I can say that it made a really 

huge difference in my life,” she said. 
“It made a huge difference in the 
life of my children, because they 
were able to be in programs that 
they had fun, they learned, while I 
was also getting my education. But 
at the end of the day, I could spend 
time with them.”

And 
while 
safe, 
affordable, 

reliable child care is invaluable 
and life-changing to the students 
and students’ children CCAMPIS 
serves, Quisha said often what 
makes it worth it is the community 
of people who understand the 
unique challenges she faces.

“I know students who use this 

grant at Western, I know students 
who use this grant at the University 
of Michigan, we might see each 
other on Facebook and say, ‘Oh hi, 
you use this grant, I use this grant, 
how are you, how are your kids 
doing?’” she said. “So just to say 
it’s a small grant, when you don’t 
have kids and you’re not in that 
lifestyle, yeah, it’s a small grant, but 
when you’re a student and you’re a 
mother or a father and you’re trying 
to raise children and go to school, 
you definitely link up with those 
people very easily because they 
understand your circumstances 
and what you’re going through.”

Midterm election cycle.

Two 
awards 
will 
be 

given, one to the institution 
that 
yields 
the 
highest 

percentage 
of 
eligible 

voter turnout for the fall 
2018 
midterm 
elections 

and another to the one 
that has the best overall 
improvement 
in 
voter 

turnout in comparison to 
the 2014 elections.

In order to track how 

many 
students 
each 

university 
is 
registering, 

the Big Ten Voter Challenge 
has paired with the online 
voter 
registering 
system 

TurboVote to show how 
many students from each 
university have registered 
by selecting their respective 
university when signing up 
online.

The 
system, 
which 

streamlines the process of 
registering to vote, allows 
students 
to 
register 
in 

their 
respective 
districts 

and states in which they 
normally reside when not at 
college.

At 
the 
latest 
Central 

Student 
Government 

meeting, 
CSG 
President 

Anushka Sarkar, an LSA 
senior, 
clarified 
some 

concerns about the system.

“We 
will 
not 
be 

encouraging 
people 
to 

be registered to vote in 
Michigan or Ann Arbor 
if this is not their regular 
residence because there are 
ethical concerns,” Sarkar 
said.

In 
collaboration 
with 

CSG, the Ginsberg Center 
for 
Community 
Service 

and Learning has taken 
initiative 
in 
assisting 

students with the online 
process of registering to 
vote 
in 
their 
respective 

states and districts where 
they reside.

With 
National 
Voter 

Registration 
Day 

approaching Sept. 26, CSG 
will be canvassing on the 
Diag throughout the day 
urging students to register 
to vote.

Last year, after a voter 

registration 
campaign 

led on the Northwestern 
University campus called 
“NU 
Votes,” 
a 
record 

96 
percent 
of 
freshman 

students were registered to 
vote, whereas beforehand 
less than half of freshmen 
were 
registered 
to 
vote 

according to an NU Votes 
volunteer.

found

campus 
with 

Roof’s face.

Diane Brown, spokeswoman 

for the Division of Public Safety 
and Security, said DPSS was 
investigating the incident in 
West Quad Residence Hall. 
Brown 
could 
not, 
however, 

provide an update on the case as 
of Monday afternoon.

Following the discovery of 

the most recent writings, MCSP 
hosted an event Sunday night 
to provide an opportunity for 
solidarity with Black students 
and other students of color. 
Those who were victims of the 
writing spoke out, noting a lack 
of tolerance for this on campus.

One 
of 
the 
individuals 

whose door was targeted, LSA 
sophomore 
Travon 
Stearns, 

spoke to the Daily prior to the 
event 
about 
his 
experience 

seeing the writing on his door.

“Everybody was, of course, 

especially 
in 
the 
Black 

community and even my friends 
who are not part of the Black 
community, was pretty outraged 
and really concerned,” Stearns 
said. “But they really were there 
for me and let me know that if I 
needed any help with support, 
they’re there was me. They 
were really upset with what had 

occurred. Very outraged.”

On Monday night, an ad-hoc 

group of students and members 
of 
the 
Muslim 
Students’ 

Association 
placed 
posters 

around campus posting walls 
saying “Black Lives Matter.” 
Other students posted posters 
saying “F--- White Supremacy.”

Business 
senior 
Chelsea 

Racelis, also a member of the 
Black-Asian 
Coalition, 
said 

the action was as much about 
solidarity 
as 
it 
was 
about 

informing non-Black students 
about the incidents.

“We expect hate from hateful 

people,” she said. “But we expect 
more from the rest, or those 
who say they’re non-political. 
In some classrooms, people act 
like nothing happened. And you 
can’t brush this under a mass 
email or tweet … saying racism 
doesn’t belong here. Clearly 
there has been made space here 
for these people.” 

MCSP 
Director 
David 

Schoem, an adjunct associate 
professor, helped lead Sunday’s 
event, noted a sense of unity 
among the community.

“We feel terrible that in 

our community they had to 
experience 
those 
disgusting 

things that were put on their 
doors, and we want to show our 
support and love,” he said. “We 
hope you will feel that we are all 
here to express that to you.”

Members of the University’s 

Muslim Students’ Association 
flyered the pillars surrounding 
the Diag. MSA Outreach Chair 
Arwa Gayar, an LSA sophomore, 
said that when the incident 
occurred in MCSP the MSA 
began thinking of ways to 
immediately act.

“Because we are MSA we are 

posting it from our perspective, 
we have a quote from the Quran, 
it’s basically saying a white has 
no superiority over a Black and 
a Black has no superiority over 
a white and the only superiority 
people have over each other is 
piety and no one knows how 
pious someone is,” Gayer said. 
“It is ingrained within our 
religion this idea of equality so 
it is a part of our mission to that 
we are doing are part to make 
sure equality is seen on this 
campus.”

Racelis 
noted 
flyering 

constitutes just one component 
of students’ organizing.

“An action like this can’t 

do anything wrong,” she said. 
“But it has to be flyering 
and 
demanding 
more 
of 

administration 
and 
calling 

out racism and standing in 
solidarity. It’s all of that.” 

The block ‘M’ in the Diag 

was also tagged with positive 
messages following the incident, 
similarly, with the phrase Black 
Lives Matter.

by a car almost twice. We need 
alternate routes (because) we

Council 
eventually 
went 

into a discussion of a resolution 
that 
would 
direct 
the 
city 

administrator to review the Ann 
Arbor 
crosswalk 
ordinance. 

The resolution received mixed 
reviews from the group. While 
some felt strongly a review of the 
process could only be beneficial, 
others argued it would unfairly 
and inevitably lead to the removal 
of the policy.

Councilman 
Jack 
Eaton, 

D-Ward 4, is a sponsor of the 
resolution. He spoke of the need 
for a review of the process and 
advocated for a push toward 
a unified state-wide policy for 
crosswalk protocol.

“I’m just pointing out that 

this resolution does not seek to 
overturn our current policy,” 
Eaton said. “We need to have 
this 
ordinance 
evaluated 
by 

professionals. … People who drive 
in Ann Arbor are unaware of 
our policies and how they drive 
around pedestrians.”

T

wo 
of 
the 
most 

destructive 
hurricanes 

in 
our 
country’s 

history just finished ravishing 
the coastline of our 
southern seaboard, and 
it made for great TV. 

Both hurricanes had 

all the elements of the 
perfect disaster story: 
terrifying 
predictions 

including reporters in 
raincoats struggling to 
stand in the wind, the 
ever-present 
satellite 

image of a multicolored 
storm spiraling toward 
the 
homeland. 
A 
terrifying 

aftermath full of flooding with 
families fleeing their homes and, 
finally, the comforting videos 
that somehow restore our faith 
in humanity as we watch first 
responders and average citizens 
rescuing people from a disaster 
we’ve been watching nonstop, 
spurring ourselves into some 
form of action, most likely 
through donations and charity.

That is, until our attention 

spans run out.

Those distinct features that 

capitalize on our desire to 
watch such tragedies and be 
moved into action to help are 
the same ones that divert our 
attention elsewhere.

North 
Korea, 
Trump’s 

Twitter, 
Myanmar 
genocide, 

Russian 
investigation, 
Neo-

Nazis, DACA are all ready to 
recapture our attention. Because 
no matter how horrifying the 
disasters in Texas and Florida 
were, no matter how much 
we are moved to charity and 
compassion — we and the media 
will move on and forget.

And when we move on, when 

our attention subsides, when 
the dramatic black-and-white 
images of mothers trudging 
through water carrying their 
children are no longer the center 
of our attention — that’s when 
we forget, and the people who 
actually needed our help the 
most never receive it.

The individuals who were 

fortunate to have private flood 
insurance will rebuild, move 
back in and try to resume a life 
after total disaster, but only 
42 percent of homes in coastal 

Florida are covered under 
such insurance, and in Texas 
even fewer homes are insured. 
In 
Harris 
County, 
which 

includes Houston 
— 
one 
of 
the 

hardest cities hit 
by the hurricane 
— only 15 percent 
of homes.

So as the TV 

networks pack up 
their news cameras 
and 
we 
resume 

our 
Facebook 

discussions on the 
benefit of hearing 

out Nazis, the hurricane victims 
who are uninsured are left to 
our federal government and the 
assistance they receive already 
looks dire. The little assistance 
they will receive are through the 
Federal Emergency Management 
Agency’s 
National 
Flood 

Insurance Program, a program 
that has been inundated since 
Hurricane Katrina in 2005 — and 
currently owes the U.S. Treasury 
some $23 billion — will now have 
to extend its credit to continue 
financing the rebuilding after 
Harvey and Irma.

And 
this 
is 
where 
the 

cynicism returns. Because such 
an endeavor by FEMA and the 
Flood Insurance program will 
be unable to keep up with the 
sheer magnitude of damage done 
to Florida and Texas — disasters 
requiring hundreds of billions of 
dollars to repair the damages.

This is where the low-income 

neighborhoods disappear, where 
families flee their homes to never 
return and, most importantly, 
where new prime real estate 
opens up.

Cue 
“disaster 
capitalism,” 

what 
writer 
Naomi 
Klein’s 

describes as corporations and 
governments utilizing disasters 
to 
“transform” 
regions 
and 

gain 
financially. 
Hurricane 

Katrina was a prime example 
of this, and as described in 
Klein’s 
book 
“The 
Shock 

Doctrine,” the shock induced 
by the hurricane allowed the 
government and corporations 
to exploit the disaster — paving 
over poor neighborhoods with 
more profitable housing and 
commercial developments.

And now, after Hurricanes 

Harvey and Irma, the poorest 
people 
affected 
by 
these 

disasters, the ones hit the 
hardest, will be subject to a 
similar campaign. This is their 
punishment for not buying a 
coverage 
policy 
that 
covers 

actual flood costs.

It will occur because we’ll 

move on. And I can already hear 
the “tough love” criticisms of 
those who are truly passionate 
about government assistance:

“Let FEMA deal with them, 

let the grossly over-budgeted 
bureaucratic Flood Insurance 
Program figure out what to do 
with those poor people who 
were either too dumb or not 
working hard enough to buy 
flood insurance on their homes.”

There is something to be said 

about the speed in which we 
handle these crises from afar. 
How we rapidly horrify and 
scare ourselves, engage on an 
emotional and charitable level 
and then so instantly move on 
and forget.

Something 
like 
this 

requires 
months 
and 
years 

of 
rebuilding. 
It 
requires 

hundreds of billions of dollars. 
It requires an understanding 
that governments, and only 
governments, 
are 
capable 

of 
handling 
such 
massive 

emergencies and cleanup efforts.

Something like this requires 

us. 
We 
need 
to 
engage 

and 
participate, 
not 
just 

through 
a 
constant 
stream 

of 
charitable 
donations 
to 

specific organizations, but an 
engagement on a level that 
requires journalism to respond. 
For us to make sure those 
poor people who lost their 
homes find a way to rebuild. 
To pressure our government 
to secure funding for these 
people, before we build that big, 
beautiful wall on the Mexican 
border. To slow down from the 
clickbait disaster-prone-ridden 
news that degrades our ability 
to understand issues and work 
toward solutions.

P

ictures coming out of 
Williston, 
N.D., 
and 

Homer, 
Alaska, 
are 

beginning to make me worry.

No, 
my 
anxiety 
is 
not 

because 
of 
destructive 

legislation coming from the 
Oval Office. Nor is it because 
I fear that the Harvey, Irma 
and Jose family might want an 
addition to their motley crew.

My anxiety lies with a 

certain 
gray-shirted, 
blue-

jeaned, 
Williston- 
and 

Homer-visiting 
billionaire: 

Mark Zuckerberg.

Early this year, Zuckerberg 

announced his goal to visit 
every state in the country in 
the hopes of understanding 
his 
2 
billion 
users 
better 

by 
“listening 
and 
learning 

about how more people are 
living, working and thinking 
about 
the 
future.”He 
has 

since visited places ranging 
from 
the 
attention-starved 

pockets of middle America to 
the more ethnically diverse 
communities on the coasts.

Zuckerberg’s 
exploits 
in 

these areas have been well 
documented. Pictures from the 
tour depicting an attentive and 
beaming Zuckerberg candidly 
injecting himself into the daily 
lives of Nebraskan locomotive 
engineers or Iowan cafe-goers 
have been continually shared 
to 
his 
nearly 
100 
million 

Facebook followers.

To 
the 
casual 
eye 

scrolling through Facebook, 
Zuckerberg’s tour seems to be 
typical procedure for the CEO 
of one of the most prominent 
companies on Earth. CEOs 
will often reach out to the 
diverse members of their base, 
learn from them and then, 
ideally, act on behalf of them. 
But Facebook is not a typical 
company, Zuckerberg is not a 
typical CEO and politicking 
today is far from typical. 

What 
differentiates 

Facebook from other companies 
is its gradually materializing 
monopoly 
on 
political 

change and persuasion. With 
Facebook’s 2 billion users and 
the revelation of fake news, 
Zuckerberg currently presides 
over an apparatus unrivaled 
in its power to discreetly sway 
public opinion.

Zuckerberg’s recent actions 

suggest that not only has he 
started to recognize these 
unique powers but that he 
is keen on using them to 
rework his own image. His 
announcement 
proclaiming 

that, in the face of his long-
held atheist identification, he 
now views “religion as very 
important”; his hiring of Joel 
Benenson, Hillary Clinton’s 
campaign chief strategist; and, 
yes, his heavily advertised 
50-state tour conducted under 
the guise of brand building 
rather 
than 
cross-country 

campaigning suggest a push 

to align himself with more 
mainstream beliefs held by the 
general U.S. populace.

The upshot of all this is 

starting to become abundantly 
clear: Zuckerberg acts and 
projects like a man positioning 
himself for a public office run 
in the near future.

Irrespective of policy, this is 

a terrifying prospect.

First, 
let’s 
not 
forget 

Facebook 
and 
Zuckerberg’s 

outsized influence in enabling 
the vitriol and disinformation 
of 
the 
2016 
presidential 

election cycle. In late August, 
the company replaced all the 
human editors in its Trending 
section with an algorithm. 
Within 72 hours, a bogus 
story from endingthefed.com 
about how Fox News anchor 
Megyn Kelly was fired for 
surreptitiously 
supporting 

Clinton made its way to the top 

of the section, where it stayed 
for a few hours.

A joint team of Harvard 

and Massachusetts Institute 
of 
Technology 
researchers 

further implicated Facebook 
in a study of media failure in 
2016. The team researched 
more than 1.25 million stories 
published between April 1, 
2015, and Election Day and 
found that “a media network 
anchored 
around 
Breitbart 

developed as a distinct and 
insulated media system, using 
social media as a backbone 
to transmit a hyper-partisan 
perspective to the world.”

Nevertheless, Zuckerberg has 

not shied away from defending 
Facebook’s 
innocence. 
In 

January, Zuckerberg professed, 
“I’m actually quite proud of the 
impact that we were able to have 
on civic discourse over all.”

The naivete of Zuckerberg’s 

response 
is 
concerning 
as 

more and more people find 
their news on Facebook. He 
is in the midst of opening 
himself 
up 
to 
showcase 

his 
all-Americanness 
and 

humanitarianism, 
yet 
he 

cowers and deflects when 

faced with one of the greatest 
weapons 
to 
democracy 
in 

recent memory. Fake news 
and 
disinformation, 
often 

originating 
from 
foreign 

actors as in the case of last 
year’s election cycle, ironically 
enough, legitimately influence 
the distortion of public opinion.

Look 
no 
further 
than 

the most recent round of 
troubling news to directly 
find Facebook’s role in the 
aforementioned 
nexus. 

Last 
Wednesday, 
Facebook 

disclosed 
to 
congressional 

investigators 
that 
between 

June 2015 and May 2017 
it sold $100,000 worth of 
advertisements to a Kremlin-
linked 
Russian 
company 

that sought to target voters 
through 
“troll” 
accounts. 

Most of the purchased ads 
focused on divisive issues 
ranging “from LGBT matters 
to race issues to immigration 
to 
gun 
rights,” 
according 

to a note published by Alex 
Stamos, the company’s chief 
security officer.

Facebook’s enabling of its 

own subversion should give 
Zuckerberg no reason to be 
proud. The company ruefully 
failed to combat fake news 
and sinister foreign influence, 
and, in the process, helped 
to elect the most unqualified 
candidate to the highest office 
in the land.

Perhaps 
that 
surprising 

result has helped Zuckerberg 
realize the political gold mine 
he has on his hands. Perhaps 
he is leveraging that influence 
to build a foundation for loftier 
goals. After all, he supervises 
the data of nearly 2 billion 
users, and it seems that this 
data has told him to project a 
carefully orchestrated veneer 
of 
corn 
husking, 
religion 

embracing 
and 
aggressive 

Facebook gloating.

But Zuckerberg needs to 

read between the lines. As 
Facebook reached the frontier 
of media influence during 
the 
presidential 
election, 

he propagated and enabled 
nefarious doings. Zuckerberg’s 
shortcomings in addressing 
the fake news, his compliance 
in 
foreign 
subversion, 
his 

cavalier attitude and, most 
importantly, 
his 
unilateral 

control and mishandling on a 
media tool powerful enough 
to 
swing 
elections 
should 

render null any of his public 
office ambitions.

But that does not mean he 

will at least give it a shot. 
Zuckerberg is smart enough 
to see that, with a little magic 
from Facebook, inexperienced 
billionaires are one for one in 
winning.

 Horrify, comfort, forget, repeat

S

ome of this year’s biggest 
political issues have not 
been the big, drawn-out 

battles that take place in Lansing 
or Washington, D.C. Important 
issues like housing, jobs and taxes 
are debated right here in Ann 
Arbor by our local government, 
a government that has little input 
from one of Ann Arbor’s most 
influential groups: students at the 
University of Michigan. 

While it may not be evident 

to most students, Ann Arbor’s 
City Council has been locked 
in a fierce election over for the 
past few months. The Aug. 8 
Democratic Primary election 
saw 
heated 
mudslinging 

between 
anti-development 

candidate David Silkworth and 
current incumbent Chip Smith. 
Blogs such as “Local in Ann 
Arbor” and papers such as Ann 
Arbor Observer hurled posts 
about each candidate’s politics 
for months. Even after the 
primary ended, independent 
candidates 
including 
Ali 

Ramlawi 
— 
owner 
of 
the 

Jerusalem Garden restaurant 

— declared candidacy over 
dissatisfaction with the results 
of the primary election.

While it may be easy to 

brush these things off as simply 
village politics that don’t matter 
to 
students, 
City 
Council’s 

responsibilities 
actually 

include some of the most 
salient and visible policy items 
in the Ann Arbor community. 
Hot-button issues like the deer 
cull and the ongoing debate 
over the Library Lot high-
rise will likely be brought into 
focus in the next council cycle. 
These issues may not seem like 
monumental 
policy 
actions 

to many students, but issues 
that do matter to students 
— including rising housing 
costs 
and 
city-University 

cooperation fall on the hands of 
the council, which seldom has 
enough student input to fairly 
represent the needs of young 
people. We don’t realize it, but 
frequently, Ann Arbor has more 

control over our everyday lives 
outside of the classroom than 
the University does.

Simply 
looking 
at 
Ann 

Arbor’s gerrymandered ward 
map will point the viewer to 
the obvious conclusion that 
Central 
Campus, 
and 
the 

heavily 
student-populated 

neighborhoods surrounding it, 
have been sliced up in a way 
that no one ward contains the 
voices of students, and that 
the concerns of students can 
be placed on the back burner 
of all 10 council members. A 
student living in the West Quad 
Residence Hall would have a 
different council member than 
a student who lived across 
the street at the South Quad 
Residence Hall. These two 
students would be represented 
differently 
than 
someone 

who lived on Tappan Avenue, 
mere steps away. All of this is 
in spite of the fact that Ann 
Arbor’s population according 
to 
the 
census 
— 
which 

determines federal funding and 
congressional 
representation 

— includes students at their 
campus addresses.

This 
creates 
a 
dynamic 

where student members of the 
Ann Arbor community won’t 
feel represented by their own 
government. The intentional 
disempowerment 
of 
student 

residents is also echoed by the 
fact that City Council elections 
are decided in August, during 
the partisan primary — a time 
when many students are away 
for vacations, internships or 
summer jobs — leaving the 
election in the hands of a few 
committed 
local 
residents. 

In fact, until this year, City 
Council races were held in non-
congressional off-years, leading 
to even lower turnout and even 
less public participation.

While the city of Ann Arbor 

recently established its Student 
Advisory Council, the roster 
for the committee currently 
only 
lists 
councilmember 

Julie Grand, D-Ward 3 with 

the contact information for 
getting involved being listed 
as 
“TBD.” 
The 
stunning 

lack of representation of the 
more than 40,000 students 
who attend the University of 
Michigan, with 10,000 students 
confirmed to be living in Ann 
Arbor is unacceptable for a city 
that prides itself on being an 
epicenter of progressive public 
policy. If every Ann Arbor-
based canvasser with an anti-
gerrymandering or pro-voting 
rights petition approached local 
politics with the same furor 
that they approach Republican-
led gerrymandering or voter 
suppression in the state House, 
then Ann Arbor’s City Council 
would have seen a dramatic 
restructuring years ago.

I urge students to stay 

aware of local political issues, 
and to contact their City 
Council member about issues 
of importance, and to always 
vote in local elections, even 
if that requires an absentee 
ballot. I also urge the city 
of Ann Arbor to focus on 
equal representation of all its 
residents. Reforms including 
redrawing wards to include 
a student-focused member of 
council, or including at-large 
or ex officio student members 
of council will go a long way 
to ensuring that all voices are 
heard in the political process.

Many of us students may 

only be four-year Ann Arbor 
residents, 
but 
the 
student 

population 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 

will continue to exist for as 
long as there is a University 
of Michigan. If our current 
political state of affairs has 
taught us anything, it is that 
participation 
in 
government 

at all levels, is crucial to the 
advancement and success of 
democracy. Staying involved in 
Ann Arbor is no different.

Student voices matter in local politics

Zuckerberg’s 
recent actions 
suggest that not 

only has he started 
to recognize these 

unique powers 

but that he is keen 
on using them to 
rework his own 

image.

FOREIGN FAMILY COLLECTIVE

ODESZA floats in space 
on their newest record

ODESZA’s creations are what 

space would sound like if sound 
could travel in interplanetary 
emptiness. Through A Moment 
Apart, Seattle duo Harrison 
Mills and Clayton 
Knight’s 
spiky, 

otherworldly, 
chill 
planetary 

fuzz 
spins 
a 

fresh 
take 
on 

mainstream 
electronica’s 
comparatively 
boring, 
bass 

powered bumps.

For 
a 
heavily 
electronic 

album, A Moment Apart does a 
good job of balancing vocal and 
purely 
instrumental 
tracks. 

What’s more, the album has 
great variety in its soundscape, 
ranging 
from 
the 
soaring, 

powerful titular track, to the 
easy-going “Across the Room.”

Just like in 2012’s Summer’s 

Gone, A Moment Apart opens 
with an “Intro,” a whispered 
clip of narration that sets the 
theme for the rest of the album. 
Where 2012’s “Intro” was more 
of an introduction to electronic 
music as a whole, 2017’s “Intro” 
is actually an excerpt from 2011 
film “Another Earth,” where 
one character tells another a 
story about a cosmonaut falling 
in love with sound, introducing 
an attempted metaphor for the 
listener’s experience with the 
album. As the dialogue fades 
away, “Intro” fades into “A 
Moment Apart,” immediately 
establishing the high energy 
and evocative spirit the album 
runs on right off the bat.

“Late Night” captures the 

essence of breathless midnight 
drives 
down 
city 
streets, 

complete with the jingle of 
car keys at the very beginning 

and a striking, catchy beat that 
evolves into glittering chords 
as the instrumentals pick up. 
When listening to the vivid 
chorus, I could practically 
see neon lights reflecting off 
shiny car paint. “La Ciudad” 
has a similarly bright, exciting 
sound, with the same air 

of 
nighttime 

adventures 
and 

unforgettable 
experiences. 
The 
difference 

between 
ODESZA’s 
music and EDM 
is 
especially 

apparent 
here. 

EDM 
is 
wild, 
but 
almost 

violently so, and even though 
“Late Night” and “La Ciudad” 
both have climactic moments, 
they also have softer, tenderer 
lulls. Ultimately, the two types 
differ greatly in tone and 
overall song structure from 
party music.

While Regina Spektor usually 

sticks 
to 
more 
traditional 

instrumental accompaniments 
like classical piano and guitar, 
“Just a Memory” melds her 
captivatingly smooth vocals 
with ODESZA’s full bodied, 
dramatic electronics. The song 
follows someone pining for a 
former lover: “I want you back 
/ In the middle of this fight / 
Baby come back and fight,” 
Spektor croons. The track is 
one of A Moment Apart’s more 
mellow compositions, and has 
the same bittersweet emotion 
as “Kusanagi” from 2014’s In 
Return.

“Thin 
Floors 
and 
Tall 

Ceilings” calls to mind acres 
and acres of free, unbounded 
sound. The first ten seconds 
of the track are reminiscent 
of 
summer 
nights 
spent 

stargazing, 
and 
the 
piece 

develops like a trip through 
time.

“Corners of the Earth” hits 

the sweet spot for a closing 
track; it’s slow and measured 
enough to feel like a proper 
wrap up to the album, but still 
emotive and memorable as 
a standout song all by itself. 
Australian singer RY X’s voice 
is deep and rich as he sings: 
“Tonight we run / We run 
into the sun / We run into the 
corners of / The love we choose 
to make.”

Altogether, 
the 
album 

builds upon the undeniable 
strength 
and 
breadth 
of 

ODESZA’s discography while 
still introducing new folds. 
It’s important to note how 

universal the group’s music is; 
whether a listener is completely 
new to the world of electronica 
or a seasoned expert, there’s 
bound to be something that 
satisfies any itch. ODESZA 
may be one of electronica’s 
more seasoned artists, but 
that doesn’t mean their music 
is stale or without merit, 
even given the often negative 
connotations 
surrounding 

that genre and its cousins. A 
Moment Apart shows that the 
duo is far from running out of 
unique ideas.

ALBUM REVIEW

‘Mother!’ is disgusting, 
and nothing really else

Movies, 
like 
novels, 
are 

stories. 
But, 
perhaps 
even 

more than a novel, a movie 
is like a poem. A movie takes 
the basic units of narrative — 
image and word — and turns 
them into emotion. And, as 
we’ve been told before, a poem 
should not mean 
but be. “Mother!,” 
unfortunately, 
only 
exists 
to 

mean, 
and 
falls 

apart completely if 
it steps outside the 
limitations of it’s 
allegory.

In 
“Mother!” 
Jennifer 

Lawrence (“Passengers”) is the 
young wife of Javier Bardem 
(“Skyfall”). Both spend the 
entire 
movie 
nameless 
as 

they move around each other 
in 
their 
isolated 
mansion. 

Lawrence is fixing up the 
house, rebuilding it from the 
ashes of a fire. She walks 
around 
barefoot, 
plastering 

walls and trying desperately 
to show her dismissive poet 
husband how much she loves 
him.

Their home is gradually 

invaded by a couple, also 
nameless, who are fans of the 
poet’s work. Lawrence and 
the audience watch in awe 
and Bardem lets the couple 
take over their home. It turns 
out, their stay opens Pandora’s 
box and soon the house is 
bursting 
with 
unnaturally 

rude houseguests who multiply 

exponentially and inexplicably. 
Lawrence’s patience is pushed 
to a breaking point.

If “Mother!” stayed in the 

world of dark domestic comedy, 
it might work. But, alas, it was 
made by Hollywood’s heaviest 
hand, 
Darren 
Arnofsky 

(“Noah”). So instead “Mother!” 
throws itself down the allegory 
rabbit 
hole 
and 
promptly 

spirals out of control.

Allegory 
is 

tricky 
because 

it’s easy to let 
the 
allegory 

take 
complete 

narrative 
control. Movies 
like 
“Tree 
of 

Life” or “Natural 

Born Killers” work because 
they let you fall so deeply in 
them that you forget X equals 
Y and This means That. They 
prioritize being over meaning. 
That’s where this film’s issues 
begin. It’s too caught up in it’s 
own tricks to be anything more 
than the sum of them.

It doesn’t help that the film’s 

choice 
allegory 
is 
biblical. 

And the entire Bible at that. 
As people pour into Mother’s 
house it becomes a microcosm 
for all the evils of the world 
— a reverse Eden of sorts. 
Similarly, Mother becomes an 
embodiment of all women — 
silenced, ignored, infantilized 
and 
ultimately 
brutally 

attacked.

I’m sure there’s a long list 

of things Darren Arnofsky 
can’t do, but first on that list 
is subtlety. That’s not a death 
sentence, but it can be an 

Achilles heel. For Arnofsky, 
the latter is creeping closer 
and closer to the former. 
There is something essential 
missing from the film — depth, 
profundity, something more 
challenging than allegory and 
violence.

Arnofsky’s films are visceral 

— I left the theater craving a hot 
shower and a Valium. Which 
is to say, the only emotion 
he’s managed to convey thus 

far in his twenty-year career 
is disgust. It’s become quite 
apparent that he’s run out of 
tricks. “Mother!” gave me cold 
sweats and confirmation that 
no matter how hard I try I will 
never be compelled by the deep 
unpleasantness of Arnofsky’s 
world. 

Disgust is boring because 

disgust 
is 
easy. 
Especially 

when it’s achieved, as it is 
in 
“Mother!” 
via 
a 
rapid 

succession 
of 
disturbing 

images. That’s why I’m hesitant 
to label this a “horror” film. 
There’s no horror in “Mother!” 
and it’s sorely lacking for that 
fact.

“Mother!” is nothing but a 

movie made for film school 
term papers and sub-reddit 
echo-chambers. Its focus was 
so far in post-production that it 
forgot to be any good.

FILM REVIEW

After four years separated, 

audiences are brought back 
to the universe of “Top of the 
Lake,” a confusing, depressive 
and riveting show. Detective 
Robin 
Griffin 
(Elisabeth 

Moss, “Mad Men”) returns 
for another case, 
visibly 
shaken 

after the ordeal 
in New Zealand. 
After 
her 

investigation 
of 

the sexual abuse 
of a twelve-year 
old, Griffin ends 
up having solved 
little-to-nothing, and in worse 
trouble 
than 
she 
started. 

Long story short: she shot the 
architect, Al Parker (David 
Wenham, 
“Killing 
Time”), 

of the pedophilia ring after 
discovering his involvement, 
but he survived, and is now 
bringing a civil suit against 

Griffin.

The day she arrives back in 

Sydney, Griffin is mocked by 
cadets who reference her and 
Al during a training exercise, 
which causes her to snap in 
response 
to 
obvious 
post-

traumatic stress disorder. At 
a different place, a pastel-blue 
suitcase is thrown off a cliff into 
the ocean. Shots of the suitcase 

in the water are 
used as an anchor 
between 
scenes. 

The object, which 
houses the body of 
a young Chinese 
woman, 
finally 

shores up. Griffin 
heads out after a 
call to the station, 

and delivers the cheesiest line 
she can while opening the case: 
“Hello, darling. Wanna tell me 
what you saw?”

One of the strengths of 

“Top of the Lake” is its focus 
on 
female-led 
narratives. 

Detective 
Griffin 
is 
a 
no 

nonsense woman eager to get 

back into work after her ordeal 
in New Zealand. She is hastily 
joined by another woman in 
the force, Miranda Hilmarson 
(Gwendoline Christie, “Game 
of Thrones”), to solve the case 
of a suitcase washed up at sea. 
Inside the suitcase is the corpse 
of a Chinese prostitute, which 
thus gives the name to this 
season of the series. The other 

most interesting characters in 
the series, Robin’s daughter 
Mary (Alice Englert, “Beautiful 
Creatures”) and her adoptive 
mother Julia (Nicole Kidman, 
“Big Little Lies”) drive the 
action forth. The men, by 

and large, are on the sides, 
watching the action play out. 
It’s an interesting inversion 
that follows the current surge 
of female-led drama.

For all its strengths, “Top 

of the Lake” does rely on a few 
cliches to tell its story. The 
insights in each characters’s 
lives are fairly one-dimensional, 
especially Detective Griffin. 
She falls into seeking work as 
a way to mask or cover up her 
pain from her earlier case, and 
her male colleagues treat her 
as an off-the-rails, emotionally 
volatile woman, which could 

be either a negative or honest 
representation — you decide. 
Mary, who is seventeen, is about 
to run off with her 41-year-old, 
brothel-running 
boyfriend, 

with little motivation except 
teenage 
rebellion. 
Finally, 

Griffin’s new sidekick Miranda 
is only defined by her eagerness 
to assist. The problem is likely 
to be remedied in further 
episodes, but the show would 
benefit 
from 
exploring 
the 

interior lives of each characters.

Womanhood, and the women 

that do not heed its traditional 
call, are leading this season 

of “Top of the Lake,” giving 
space 
for 
some 
interesting 

interplay 
across 
multiple 

dynamics. 
There’s 
Miranda, 

who is striking and tall, not 
traditionally 
feminine, 
then 

Robin, who has been raped and 
mistreated, 
rebellious 
Mary 

and finally her mother, Julia, 
who divorces her husband and 
has an affair with a woman. All 
these levels of class, appearance 
and generation are ripe with 
drama and action, which will be 
sure to draw audiences in. The 
only question is — how soon are 
they going to have to wait?

Social watching in the 
age of ‘Game of Thrones’

It’s Sunday night. Everyone 

gathers in a room too small 
for the party size. Beers are 
cracked 
open. 
Snacks 
are 

passed around. The group 
squishes, squeezes and finally 
settles into their seats. It’s 
Sunday night, and “Game of 
Thrones” is about to begin.

The anticipation in the room 

is palpable. In the moments 
leading 
up 
to 
9:00 
p.m., 

theories are thrown around the 
room as to what bomb will be 
dropped this evening. Reddit 
is referenced. Someone says 
something outlandish that the 
rest of the group pretends not 
to hear. Two watchers engage 
in a heated debate about the 
parentage of a certain bastard. 
Another reminds the room 
of the significance of a two-
minute scene three seasons 
ago. The host silently worries 
something will go wrong with 
the sound or live-stream and 
he or she will face the wrath of 
the guests.

At 8:58 p.m., the host logs 

into his or her parent’s HBO 
Go account and pulls up the 
home page. The room tenses. 
Then, at 9:00 p.m. the new 
episode appears on the site. 
It begins. The “previously 
on” rolls, signaling what will 
be 
significant 
this 
week. 

Eyebrows are raised when 
a moment from Season One 
shows up. One member of the 
group fist bumps the air when 
the two-minute scene from 
three seasons ago re-appears. 
Collective sighs are heard 
when 
a 
now-deceased 

character graces the screen.

The room obediently sings 

along to the melodic “buhm-
buhm- dum-dum- dum” of the 
theme song. Even after seven 
seasons, fans remain amazed 
at the theme as it takes them 
from Westeros to Winterfell 
to the Iron Islands. The magic 
of a map, scored by an intense 
instrumental beat, never gets 
old.

Then the show begins, and 

for somewhere in the range of 
60 to 90 minutes, the room is 
enraptured in pure cinematic 
bliss. Even after it ends, they 
spend days re-living those 
moments, anxious for next 
Sunday and fearful for the 
rapidly-approaching end.

In an age when television 

content is over-saturated and 
viewers can choose from 30 
different platforms to watch 
1,000 
different 
shows, 
a 

common viewing experience is 
almost as mythical as Khaleesi 
and her Dragons. It’s out there, 
but hard to find. Even harder to 
keep safe and sacred, if you can 
get your hands on it in the first 
place. Once this experience 
is harnessed, however, the 
sheer magnitude and power it 
holds is inimitable. It’s rare, 
endangered and on the brink 
of extinction.

People don’t set aside a 

consistent, weekly hour to 
watch a TV show anymore. 
They 
don’t 
gather 
their 

friends and family together 
for content that’s available 
anywhere, anytime. They don’t 
walk into a party, an interview, 
a classroom and feel confident 
that others will know anything 
about what they’ve just seen.

With the rise of streaming 

content 
came 
the 
fall 
of 

collective watching. That is, 
with the exception of “Game of 
Thrones.”

Disclaimer — I haven’t seen 

seasons four through seven 
of the show. My HBO account 
remains 
frozen 
on 
season 

three, 
episode 
nine. 
The 

infamous Red Wedding is one 
episode away. There are four 
seasons of secrets, betrayals 
and gruesome murders I’ve yet 
to see.

Despite 
this 
deficit 
of 

knowledge, however, I tuned 
in on Sunday, Aug. 27. to watch 
the season seven finale. Now. 
This is the point where die-
hard Thrones fans cringe. 
Where they print out a picture 
of my face and throw darts at 
it. Unfriend me on Facebook 
and unfollow me on Instagram. 
What I’ve done, what I’m 
doing, what I do, is a travesty 

to the narrative of the show.

Despicable, some might say. 

Why, they ask, would I choose 
to ruin the show for myself? 
My answer? I don’t want to 
miss out.

For roughly eight weeks of 

every year, this rare “collective 
watching” experience occurs. 
The opportunity to be a part 
of it is akin to Sunday Night 
Football. At the risk of over-
playing 
the 
importance 
of 

“Game of Thrones,” there is 
a sense of something greater 
than ourselves when watching 
the show. It captures the 
essence of what entertainment 
should be — an experience 
that brings people together 
and sparks discussion.

So, I choose to engage 

in a show I’ve only half-
watched. I don’t ask when 
an unrecognizable character 
enters. I keep my opinions 
to what I know. I try not to 
blow my cover as a dedicated 
“Thrones fan.” Because when 
shit hits the fan, when the 
dragons breathe fire, and the 
White Walkers wreak havoc, 
it doesn’t matter if you know 
everything there is to know. 
It’s about being there, in the 
moment, creating a collective 
memory.

I watch “Game of Thrones” 

socially. On the night of the 
season finale, I found myself 
sitting in a room with six boys 
I’d met just minutes before. 
Eager to watch Thrones in 
a group setting with people 
passionate about the show, 
I asked my new neighbors 
if they were watching. They 
were. There is no better way 
to get to know the neighbors 
than over dragons, incest, 
murder and the general fear of 
winter.

No other television series 

in recent years, in my opinion, 
has had the same widespread 
following and general public 
awareness 
as 
“Game 
of 

Thrones.” Maybe it’s because 
we’re desperate for something 
to bring us together. But also, 
maybe because at the end of 
the day, “Game of Thrones” is 
just an amazing fucking show.

‘Whose’ is a call to arms

“It is our duty to fight for our 

freedom. It is our duty to win. 
We must love and support one 
another. We have nothing to 
lose but our chains.”

It’s a mantra spoken over 

and over again in “Whose 
Streets.” It’s spoken quietly 
and in screams, 
in loving circles 
of hugs and tears 
and in the face of 
hordes of police 
with 
machine 

guns. It’s spoken 
in 
the 
booming 

voices of massive 
crowds and by the 
lone cry of a girl who can’t be 
older than 11. To describe it as 
“powerful” would be an insult. 
To describe it at all would be a 
disservice — you need to see it.

This movie is essential. Made 

by Sabaah Folayan and Damon 
Davis in both their directorial 
debuts, the film was created on 
the frontlines of the Ferguson 
protests in 2014, following the 
shooting of unarmed black 
teenager Michael Brown by 
police officer Darren Wilson.

“Whose 
Streets” 
is 

cinematic, filled with striking, 
chilling images. We see a 
memorial of teddy bears and 
candles burned to the ground. 
We see an old woman pepper 
sprayed and dragged across 
the street. A baby who’s been 
arrested and tear gassed. A 
mother who is forced to explain 
to her little girl that she might 
get shot if she goes out there, 

but she has to do it anyway. A 
group of black men are told by 
police to “go home” as they’re 
standing in their own front 
yard, just before the police 
throw tear gas at them. A line 
of young people holding hands, 
armed with nothing but signs, 
repeating their mantra over 
and over again as they face off 
against rows and rows of police 
with guns and canisters of gas 

at the ready.

But 
perhaps 

the 
most 

striking decision 
on the part of the 
filmmakers was 
to 
spend 
very 

little time on the 
particulars 
of 

Darren Wilson’s 

case. His face gets maybe a 
minute of screen time. What 
we see instead of his testimony 
is a group of Ferguson residents 
and 
protesters 
outside the 

courthouse, 
surrounding 

Michael Brown’s mother and 
holding 
her 
as 
prosecutor 

Robert McCulloch announces 
Wilson would not be indicted 
by the grand jury. The look on 
her face is unfathomable.

“Whose Streets” insists on 

the fundamental humanity and 
pain of a community who is so 
often painted by the media as 
violent thugs and looters. “This 
is so sad,” says a woman taking 
a video of a convenience store 
being set on fire. “This is so 
fucking sad.” The film makes 
no space for the mainstream 
media’s 
discomfort 
and 

subsequent 
distortion 
with 

the movement’s method of 
resistance. As activist Kayla 

Reed says, “You can rebuild a 
building. You can’t resuscitate 
Michael Brown.”

The filmmakers don’t make 

their presence known in the 
documentary, but it’s obvious 
by the intimacy of the footage 
and the ease with which their 
interview 
subjects 
speak 

to the camera that Folayan 
and Davis are trusted and 
respected within the Ferguson 
community. And that really is 
the subject of the documentary 
— not the individual activists 
whose stories are told, but the 
city itself. It’s a film about a 
community that’s been living 
in fear for as long as they can 

remember, but that still has a 
fundamental hope for a better 
future. They wouldn’t continue 
fighting if they didn’t hope.

At 
its 
heart, 
“Whose 

Streets” is a call to arms. It’s 
impossible to watch this film 
and not feel pushed to show 
up, put in the time, the effort, 
the risk — because people are 
dying. There’s no space for 
anything but absolute urgency. 
“Whose Streets” is insistent 
to delineate between urgency 
and hatred, though. “We don’t 
do this because we hate the 
police,” says Reed. “We do this 
because we love each other. 
And love always wins.”

“Whose 
Streets” 
doesn’t 

look away. It doesn’t flinch. 
It’s hard to watch at times, 
and that’s on purpose — this 
reality is anything but easy. 
It’s a movie full of heart, anger 
and genuine abject horror. 
And yet, you leave the theater 
struck by the pulsing, beating 
heart of this community and its 
relentless energy. Because they 
don’t just believe in a better 
future — they’re building one.

Wolverines top Hoosiers, 2-1, in Sunday matchup

It was a day of relief for the 

Michigan women’s soccer team. 

After a 4-0-1 start to their 2017 

campaign, the Wolverines (1-1 Big 
Ten, 4-2-3 overall) had been winless 
in their previous four games and had 
been shutout in their last two games 
coming into Sunday’s matchup with 
Indiana. But over the span of 3:27 in 
the first half against the Hoosiers 
(1-1, 5-4-1), Michigan’s offensive 
luck changed dramatically, and it 
was able to hang on for a 2-1 win.

It started with forward Reilly 

Martin. 
The 
junior’s 
season 

exemplifies the type of frustration 
the Wolverines have faced — she 
leads the team in shots but, before 
Sunday, hadn’t scored a goal. She led 
the team in shots once again Sunday 
and finally converted on those 
opportunities.

In the 22nd minute, Martin 

received a pass from redshirt 
sophomore midfielder Katie Foug. 
Martin flicked the ball in the air, 
spun around the Indiana defender 
and poked it into the back of the net.

“(It was) definitely good to finally 

break the ice on scoring,” Martin 
said. “We’ve had some unlucky 
games and just couldn’t finish them, 
but I think we finally got back on 
track.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
offensive 

fortunes continued to trend upward 
moments later. In the 25th minute, 
redshirt senior midfielder Ani 
Sarkisian sent a through ball into 
the box, and just before the Indiana 
goalkeeper could get to it, freshman 
midfielder 
Nicki 
Hernandez 

touched it over her and deposited it 
into the open net.

It was Hernandez’s first career 

goal, but her own relief extended 
beyond even that. Hernandez has 
had lingering health issues that have 
held her out of action. According 
to her, it was actually her time on 
the shelf that gave her the ability to 
maintain composure on her goal.

“When I was out and injured with 

the concussion and the ankle, I was 
always practicing on my touches 
and things like that, situations like 
that,” Hernandez said. “So when 
the actual situation happened, I was 
able to be calm.”

But Michigan wasn’t out of the 

woods yet. The Hoosiers pulled 
within a goal thanks to a header 
from Chandra Davidson off a corner 
kick in the 40th minute, and they 
pressed the Wolverine defense near 
the end of the game.

At one point, Indiana appeared to 

have tied the game, but the goal was 
negated by a handball.

In the end, Michigan staved off 

the Hoosiers, and for the first time 
in 21 days, coach Greg Ryan and his 
team celebrated.

“We needed to win a game in 

the Big Ten, right?” Ryan said. 
“We thought we were better than 
Purdue, but we didn’t come away 
with a win. So today, it was just 
critical to get the result. I was very 
happy with the way we played.”

The Wolverines will continue Big 

Ten play next weekend when they 
travel to Minnesota and Wisconsin. 
And with a good feeling for the first 
time in a few games, they believe 
Sunday was simply a sign of things 
to come.

“It’s great finally having a win, 

especially at home and being away 
next weekend,” Martin said. “I 
think just having that confidence 
on us to know that we’re going to 
do well this Big Ten season with a 
win on our back moving forward, 
it’s really going to give us a boost of 
confidence.”

It may have taken the Michigan 

women’s soccer team some time 
to settle into its matchup Sunday 
against Indiana, but once the 
defense and offense clicked, the 
Wolverines prevailed over the 
Hoosiers, 2-1. 

Indiana 
outshot 
Michigan 

in the first half, 14-9, but the 
Wolverines — with a seamless 
offense on full display — managed 
to find the back of the net. 

In the 21st minute of the first 

half, junior forward Reilly Martin 
pivoted on a pass from redshirt 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Katie 

Foug and buried the ball past 
the goalkeeper in the bottom left 
corner of the goal.

It was a good finish by Martin. 

But the setup may have been even 
better. After a feeder pass from the 
back line, Foug made mincemeat of 
the Hoosiers’ defense, delivering a 
pass to Martin at the top of the 18. 
Martin took care of the rest.

“Just working together, offense 

and defense, and putting in the 
extra work to make that last 
starting run or whatever it takes 
to get the goal is what it was going 
to take to win the game today,” 
Martin said.

Michigan’s transition offense 

was in true form Sunday due to a 
combination of factors. First was 
Indiana’s formation. The Hoosiers 
played a 4-1-4-1, leaving the top of 
the defense vulnerable.

As soon as the Wolverines broke 

past the four midfielders, they had 

plenty of room to maneuver and 
connect every part of the field in 
their attack.

“The way they played opened 

up the counter for us,” Ryan said. 
“… Today I thought we were a bit 
more patient with it.”

That certainly showed in the 

24th minute.

Following a substantial amount 

of coordination in the midfield 
area above the four defenders, 
fifth-year senior midfielder Ani 
Sarkisian lofted a ball over the 
Hoosiers’ defense to freshman 
midfielder Nicki Hernandez, who 
poked the ball past the goalkeeper.

Despite 
previous 
offensive 

woes 
this 
season, 
Michigan 

has found solace in its team 
communication and transitions, 
involving every single person on 
the field.

“Right from the start we knew 

that it was going to be a tough 
battle,” Martin said. “Indiana is a 
great team.”

Defensively, the Wolverines 

staved off 17 shots while letting 
in only one. However, the image 
from Sunday was not of an 
onslaught from Indiana’s front 
line, but scattered attempts by the 
Hoosiers to hit the net.

Michigan’s 
pipeline 
from 

its backline to frontline was so 
overwhelming that Indiana was 
forced to take uncoordinated and 
frantic shots.

After their recent losses, many 

would think that the Wolverines’ 
offense would not be able to gel 
enough to be productive. But 
Michigan proved that notion false 
Sunday by scoring two goals where 
the Wolverines showed that they 
were on the same wavelength, 
and that could easily be the key to 
turning things around.

“This year we’ve had a lot of 

possession, but we haven’t been 
scoring as much in the counter,” 
said Michigan coach Greg Ryan. 
“Today we started to get the 
counterattack fired up again.”

‘M’ sweeps Cincinnati, caps off strong showing

Sophomore setter Mackenzie 

Welsh and redshirt sophomore 
middle blocker Cori Crocker 
shut down Cincinnati’s final 
scramble with a block, ending 
the third set as dominantly as 
they had in the first two sets.

The final exclamation point 

by Welsh and Crocker sealed 
the No. 21 Michigan volleyball 
team’s sweep in the Michigan 
Challenge Tournament, capping 
off the final matchup against 
Cincinnati with a 3-0 victory.

Against 
its 
previous 

opponents in the tournament, 
many Wolverines posted either 
season- or career-high numbers. 
Against UW-Milwaukee, junior 
outside hitter Carly Skjodt and 
senior middle blocker Claire 
Kieffer-Wright 
recorded 
a 

season-high 16 kills and seven 
blocks, 
respectively. 
Senior 

outside hitter Adeja Lambert 
also totaled five blocks, a career 
high.

With 
momentum 
from 

the 
previous 
two 
matches, 

Michigan started the first set on 
a tear, outscoring the Bearcats, 
9-2, and recording three blocks 
during the stretch.

“Our 
defense 
across 
the 

board hasn’t been where we 
want it to be, and that’s been a 
big focus for us the whole week 
at practice,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “I thought 
we were a little bit better maybe 
in the last two matches, but I 
thought tonight was the best 
defensive, and especially the 
best blocking match we’ve had 
this season.”

After 
a 
brief 
Cincinnati 

timeout, 
the 
Wolverines 

continued to push the Bearcats, 
capitalizing off their mistakes 
and going on a seven-point run 
that forced another Cincinnati 
timeout. Four of the seven 
points scored were off attacking 
or ball handling errors made by 
the Bearcats.

Michigan won the set, 25-16, 

despite allowing Cincinnati to 
score off careless errors, such as 

two service errors, a bad set and 
four attack errors.

Though they ended the first 

set 
poorly, 
the 
Wolverines 

narrowed down their mistakes 
entering the second set to take 
the lead, 9-2. With a comfortable 
lead, Michigan took riskier 
points, 
as 

Welsh 
scored 

on two back-
to-back 
dump 

shots.

However, 

Cincinnati 
answered with 
a 
small 
run, 

scoring 
four 

straight, 
and 

shortened 
the 

deficit through 
relentless 
attacks to make the set 15-13. 
With a call reversal going to the 
Bearcats, Cincinnati returned 
from the game delay down only 
one and with momentum in its 
favor.

Hustling for every loose ball 

and making improbable digs 
helped Michigan counter the 

Bearcats’ push for the lead. The 
two teams went back and forth 
before the Wolverines gained 
control toward the end of the 
set 
due 
to 
Kieffer-Wright’s 

efforts, who had six kills in 
eight attempts. Junior libero 
Jenna Lerg, who led all players 

with 
16 
digs, 

clinched the win 
by serving an ace 
that 
ricocheted 

off 
a 
middle 

blocker to bounce 
out 
of 
bounds 

to claim the set, 
25-21.

While 
serves 

helped Michigan 
win the second 
set, 
Cincinnati 

used 
them 
to 

dominate the beginning of the 
third.

“(Cincinnati) came out and 

changed their serving, and 
they served the heck out of the 
ball.” Rosen said. “We use the 
term ace or error mentality. 
They came out and they were 
either going to ace it or make 

an error, and they were just 
blasting serves. In the third set 
they were banging serves at us 
really hard and our players had 
to really fight through that.”

Down four points midway 

through the third set, Michigan 
used its first and only timeout 
of the game, unable to deal with 
the adjustments the Bearcats 
made during intermission.

Returning from the timeout, 

Skjodt, the tournament’s MVP, 
attacked Cincinnati’s middle 
blockers with a cross court 
spike that began a 6-1 run. 
Skjodt ended the match with 
eight kills and nine digs.

Once the Wolverines regained 

the 12-11 lead, they encountered 
few obstacles en route to a win, 
25-18. Kieffer-Wright led the 
team in kills and blocks, with 10 
and 7, respectively. The entire 
team stepped up on its defense, 
recording 
a 
season-high 
13 

blocks.

This 
is 
the 
momentum 

Michigan 
will 
need 
as 
it 

prepares for conference play 
against No. 1 Minnesota.

MEN’S CROSS COUNTRY
Michigan dominates
adidas XC challenge

The Michigan men’s cross 

country 
team 
began 
its 

competitive 
racing 
season 

with a victory at the adidas XC 
Challenge in Cary, N.C. this 
past Friday. 

The 
Wolverines 
received 

a team score of 22, beating 
second-place North Carolina 
State and third-place Wake 
Forest, which finished with 
36 points and 126 points, 
respectively. With 13 teams 
competing in the event, the 
Challenge gave Michigan its 
first proper race of the season, 
having held the Michigan 
Open two weeks ago. While 
the Open provided the team 
with a good opportunity to 
practice, it was not scored, and 
as such did not have the same 
competitive feel as a real race.

Carrying the Wolverines to 

victory were fifth-year seniors 
Ben Flanagan and Billy Bund, 
who finished first and third in 
the individual category with 
times of 18:12.1 and 18:14.1, 
respectively.

Flanagan, 
a 
two-time 

Academic 
All-Big 
Ten, 

missed most of last season 
due to injuries, making this 
weekend’s 
event 
his 
first 

healthy race in over a year. 
Having 
finished 
ninth 
in 

2015 NCAA Championships 
in the 10,000-meter category, 
expectations 
for 
Flanagan 

are high this season, with 
Michigan 
coach 
Kevin 

Sullivan 
being 
especially 

pleased with his performance 
on Friday.

Sullivan 
stressed 
that 

races like Friday’s are strong 
confidence builders, and that 
the coaching staff was looking 
forward to seeing Flanagan 
continue to improve over the 
course of the season.

With three of the team’s 

top-nine runners at home to 
train, many younger athletes 
were given the opportunity to 

compete.

Notable 
performances 

came from redshirt freshman 
Isaac Harding, sophomores 
Ben Hill and Keenan Rebera 
and freshman Jacob Lee who 
finished 
6-8-10-12 
in 
the 

Challenge. 

“We’ve seen a big jump in 

performance from a lot of 
these guys,” Sullivan said. 
“They put in a lot of hard work 
(last year), which sometimes 
goes unnoticed, so it was 
nice to see them reaping the 
rewards of that hard work.”

The XC Challenge was a 

good start and a solid first 
step in the Wolverines’ six 
weeks of preparation ahead of 
the Big Ten Championships, 
which it last won two years 
ago. A fifth-place finish in the 
conference last year marked 
a break from five straight 
seasons of top-three finishes 
in the Big Ten, as well as five 
straight appearances in the 
NCAA Championships. Hopes 
are high that this season can 
provide a return to success.

“Our championship comes 

down to one day in October,” 
Sullivan said. “We don’t have a 
regular season championship, 
we don’t accumulate wins and 
losses, it all comes down to the 
last Sunday in October.”

The 
upcoming 
races 

provide these aforementioned 
athletes — as well as other 
young talents such as redshirt 
freshman Andrew Lorant and 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Jordy 

Hewitt — the opportunity 
to develop and prepare for 
championships later in the 
year.

Sullivan stressed that being 

able to compete despite being 
tired from previous races was 
especially important to the 
team’s success.

“You may not feel your 

best, you may not feel your 
sharpest,” 
Sullivan 
said. 

“But you got to learn how to 
compete in those situations as 
well.”

Nordin’s three-point self: accurate, loud, Wild

Jim Harbaugh doesn’t find 

anything unusual about Quinn 
Nordin. 

Michigan’s 
head 
coach 

certainly knows Nordin well 
— he famously slept over at 
Nordin’s house while pursuing 
him throughout a long-winded 
recruitment.

But 
to 
his 
teammates, 

Nordin is an enigma.

“Quinn is an outspoken guy,” 

said sophomore receiver Eddie 
McDoom. “It’s very funny. 
When I see kickers, I don’t see 
them as Quinn. Quinn is very 
— I don’t know how to explain 
Quinn. Quinn is Quinn.”

Given how Michigan’s new 

starting kicker has taken the 
world of college football by 
storm, it’s hard not to believe 
McDoom.

Nordin was named the Big 

Ten Special Teams Player of 
the Week for the second time 
in three games this year. He’s 
connected on 11-of-13 attempts 
this season, tied for the most 
in the nation, 
and 
he’s 

been 
hugely 

important 
for 

a 
Michigan 

offense 
that 

has scored only 
one touchdown 
in 10 red zone 
appearances 
this year. 

The redshirt 

freshman 
tied a school 
record against Air Force this 
past week by hitting five field 
goals. Nordin had previously 
set a program record in the 
season-opening 
win 
over 

then-No. 17 Florida by kicking 

two field goals of 50 yards or 
more. He’s also well on pace 
to shatter Remy Hamilton’s 
season record of 25 field goals.

But it takes more than a 

strong and accurate leg to 

endear a kicker 
to 
a 
national 

audience. 
In 

Nordin’s 
case, 

what 
sets 
him 

apart 
is 
his 

haircut. It’s the 
same look that 
Charlie 
Sheen’s 

character, 
nicknamed 
“Wild 
Thing,” 

sported 
in 
the 

popular 
1989 

film “Major League.” And it 
caught the attention of many 
fans who viewed the season 
opener.

“Ricky Vaughn, the ‘Wild 

Thing’ (nickname) — I just 

have a mentality as a closer,” 
Nordin said after the Florida 
game. “When the team needs 
me, just go in there (and 
execute).”

For 
his 
teammates, 
the 

hairdo is just 
more evidence 
that Nordin — 
as 
sophomore 

defensive 
end 

Rashan 
Gary 

opined — has 
more flair than 
most kickers.

“It’s actually 

cool,” 
Gary 

said. 
“I 
like 

the little swag. 
Little 
kicker 

gotta have something.”

McDoom 
— 
who 
has 
a 

unique hairstyle of his own — 
said Nordin has the demeanor 
of a skill position player.

“Quinn’s 
a 
really 
good 

friend,” McDoom said. “Just 
hanging out with him, I feel 
like Quinn is not just a normal 
kicker. 
In 
my 
mind, 
he’s 

just like a normal receiver. 
Mentally, he has that vibe 

about him, that 
demeanor.”

Perhaps 

purposefully, 
Nordin 
hasn’t 

given 
much 

public indication 
of 
what 
that 

unique demeanor 
is 
like. 
When 

asked about his 
success and his 
responsibilities, 
he’s 
mostly 

chosen 
to 
answer 
with 

platitudes.

“Whatever they call me out 

to do, I’m going to do to the 
best of my ability,” Nordin said 
Saturday night. “If it’s a field 

goal or PAT, I’m just going 
to try my hardest and put it 
through.”

The little details, though, 

paint a different picture. The 
haircut, the testimonies of his 
teammates — and even an old 
recruiting video during which 
Nordin commits to Penn State 
while disembarking a private 
plane — show that Michigan’s 
kicker, indeed, does not fit the 
typical mold for his position.

That certainly wouldn’t be 

as endearing to fans — and 
perhaps teammates — if Nordin 
struggled to make kicks. But 
that hasn’t been the case.

“Quinn’s a beast,” Gary said. 

“There’ll be times in practice 
we go field goal block and he’s 
booming 60s. 60s. It’s just 
crazy seeing that. Sometimes I 
have to look back like, ‘Wow.’ 
Quinn’s a beast. I’m happy he’s 
my kicker.”

Black out for season with foot injury

The No. 8 Michigan football 

team (3-0) will be without its 
leading receiver when it begins 
the Big Ten season this weekend 
at Purdue. 

Freshman wide receiver Tarik 

Black suffered a foot injury 
against Air Force and will need 
surgery, said Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh on Monday. Black 
has a crack on the outside of his 
foot, and Harbaugh said he does 
not know if the receiver will 
return this season.

However, 
later 
Monday 

evening, Black posted a photo on 
Instagram with a caption that 
suggested he would be out for 
the remainder of the year.

In his first three games 

for Michigan, Black made 11 
catches for 149 yards and one 
touchdown, leading the trio 
of starting receivers that also 
includes junior Grant Perry and 
sophomore Kekoa Crawford.

“Tarik is a big-time player,” 

said fellow receiver sophomore 
Eddie McDoom. “He can take it 
downfield, he’s a fast guy, very 
good in his routes and he’s very 
smart. For him being that young, 
he’s a very good player.”

Added 
senior 
offensive 

lineman Mason Cole: “A kid 
that’s that talented and putting 
in so much work to perform that 
well as a true freshman — to see 
him get hurt and miss a lot of 
time, it’s tough. You feel for the 
kid. … He’s a tough kid. He’ll pull 
through just fine.”

Other Wolverines hoped to 

give Black their advice. Fifth-
year senior linebacker Mike 
McCray couldn’t play his junior 
year due to injuries, but felt that 
there were still positives he took 
away from the experience on the 
sideline.

That season, McCray spent 

ample time watching film and 
learning from older guys on 
the team. He hasn’t talked to 

Black yet about the injury, but 
when he does, he’ll have words 
of encouragement. He hopes 
the young receiver takes time 
to grow his knowledge of the 
game.

“Don’t 
let 

this deter you,” 
McCray 
said. 

“I 
know 
it’s 

hard. You want 
to be out there, 
but 
trust 
the 

process. You’ll 
eventually 
be back. Just 
grind, 
and 

you’ll 
be 
the 

same player as before, or even 
better.

“…Outside of football, it kind 

of makes you think about your 
future. It’s one thing I thought 
about.”

Filling in for Black will be two 

candidates: the aforementioned 
McDoom and freshman receiver 
Donovan Peoples-Jones.

Peoples-Jones 
made 
two 

catches 
for 
52 

yards 
against 

Air 
Force, 
and 

notably made the 
biggest 
impact 

last 
Saturday 

with his 79-yard 
punt return for a 
touchdown.

Peoples-Jones 

fits the same mold 
as 
Black. 
Both 

excel when they 

line up out wide, and it seems 
likely that he’ll replace Black as 
the starter. McDoom brings his 
own strengths and spoke with 
media Monday about his role.

McDoom 
didn’t 
win 
the 

starting job this season, and 
so far has notched just two 
receptions for 14 yards and 
three carries for 10 yards.

Despite a lack of regular 

playing time, he 
has become a fan 
favorite. McDoom 
endeared himself 
to fans with jet 
sweeps last year 
met with roars of 
“Doooooom” from 
the 
Michigan 

crowd. 
Though 

outside of running 
jet sweeps from 
the slot position, 
McDoom hasn’t had a major 
receiving role to this point in his 
career.

“I take what I’m given,” 

McDoom said. “If I get a jet 
sweep, I’ll make the best out of 

it. If I get a route, I’ll run that 
route and get open.”

With Black’s injury, McDoom 

may be forced to line up outside 
more often. Even though he 

mainly 
plays 

out of the slot, 
he said that he 
doesn’t 
have 

any preference 
regarding 
where he lines 
up.

“On 
the 

outside, 
you 

can 
go 
over 

the top, and on 
the inside you 

can slide through the safeties,” 
McDoom said.

Wherever Harbaugh decides 

to utilize him, McDoom’s speed 
will be his biggest threat.

He plays for three special 

teams units — kickoff, punt 
return and punt defense — and 
when he is on offense, he usually 
gets handed the ball in motion. 
Few opponents have had an 
answer 
for 
when 
McDoom 

comes flying across the field.

And 
Michigan’s 
next 

opponent, Purdue (3-0), will 
have to prepare to see more 
of McDoom than it may have 
initially expected. He finally 
has the chance to take on a 
larger role, but McDoom still 
wished his teammate Black the 
best of luck in recovery.

“It’s sad to say he had this 

injury,” he said. “I hope he 
returns very soon, but we have 
a game to play this week and 
we’re going to prepare for it.”

Freshman wide receiver Tarik Black injured his foot against Air Force on Saturday, and will not be sidelined for the rest of what was a stellar opening season.

For him being 
that young, he’s 

a very good 

player.

He’s a tough 
kid. He’ll pull 
through just 

fine.
