University of Michigan Central 

Student Government President 
Anushka Sarkar, an LSA senior, 
signed the assembly’s resolution 
AR 7-019 that calls for the 
University to investigate possible 
divestment from companies that 
violate Palestinian human rights.

In a secret ballot vote last 

Wednesday 
morningat 
CSG’s 

meeting, 
the 
#UMDivest 

movement passed for the first 
time on the University’s Ann 
Arbor campus with 23 votes 

in favor, 17 votes against and 5 
abstentions. 
The 
resolution’s 

passage, and the tumultuous 
history of the #UM Divest 
movement, has sparked action 
from students on both sides of the 
issue. Last Wednesday’s decision 
has since further divided the 
campus.

In 
a 
statement 
released 

Tuesday night, Sarkar expanded 
on her personal beliefs that the 
University should not invest in 
companies allegedly endangering 
the lives of Palestinians.

“I 
believe 
the 
intent 
of 

this resolution is to elevate a 
marginalized community’s voice, 
voices that have been muffled and 
diluted, year after year,” Sarkar 
wrote. “I believe the students who 

The University of Michigan 

has seen countless acts of hate 
targeted 
against 
people 
of 

color and other marginalized 
communities in recent years. 
The University administration 
has responded to such acts in 
a variety of ways. In October 
2016, the University launched 
its five-year Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion strategic plan to 
foster a welcoming and inclusive 
campus. However, the plan has 
been criticized for failing to put a 
stop to racist attacks.

These issues are not unique 

to the University of Michigan. 
Across the country, university 
administrations 
and 
campus 

communities have struggled to 
address issues of diversity, acts 
of hate and negative campus 
climates.

This article is part two of a 

series in which The Michigan 
Daily looks at colleges similar 
to the University of Michigan 
on the issue of reacting in a 
tense campus climate. As the 
University 
administration 

and students face their own 
numerous bias incidents, The 
Daily will look at other schools to 
compare and contrast incidents, 
administration 
response 
and 

student activism, whether it is 
a difference in religion, culture, 
politics or policies. This article 
will feature schools from the 
Midwestern 
region 
including 

University 
of 
Wisconsin-

Madison, 
Northwestern 

University 
and 
Indiana 

University.

There 
is 
a 
theory 
that 

prominent, progressive schools 
are targets for bias incidents 
— the University of Michigan 
among them, as Washtenaw is a 
blue county in a newly turned red 
state. In an earlier interview with 
The Daily, University President 
Mark Schlissel said there might 
not be a way to mitigate the target 
on the University’s back.

“I think that part of being a 

prominent 
university, 
taking 

clear positions on things, having 
large numbers of very successful 
graduates out there in the world, 
being on TV all the time, being in 
the media all the time means that 

what happens here gets noticed,” 
he said. “That’s the sort of other 
side of this double-edged sword 
of being famous and prominent.”

According to enrollment data 

from University of Wisconsin-
Madison’s Office of the Registrar, 
approximately 2.9 percent of its 
student population is African 
American as of fall 2017. Kevin 
Helmkamp, the assistant vice 
provost and associate dean of 
students at UW, explained how 
the demographics of the state 
lead to this.

“I think every institution is 

the same in these regards, I think 
every institution is different as 
well with that,” he said. “We 
all have our thing with that. I 
think Michigan … (has) a broader 

number of cities and communities 
with a strong African American 
population than what Wisconsin 
does, which really is kind of 
Milwaukee. You have to look at 
Milwaukee Public Schools and 
issues that exist there, that’s all 
part of our dynamic.”

Though Donald Trump won 

Wisconsin in the 2016 election, 
71.4 percent of voters in Dane 
County, where UW is located, 
voted for former presidential 
candidate Hillary Clinton.

According to the 2016 U.S. 

Census Bureau, the state of 
Wisconsin has a 6.7 percent 
Hispanic or Latino population, 
a 6.6 percent Black or African 
American population and a 2.8 

LGBTQ+ Michiganders may not 

be protected from discrimination 
under the Michigan Constitution, 
a gap in civil rights now fervently 
trying to be patched.

Under 
the 
Elliott-Larsen 

Civil Rights Act, discrimination 
based on sex is prohibited. 
However, the definition of sex 
under this statute has never 
fully been fleshed out. Because 
of this, Equality Michigan, a 
LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, 
asked the Michigan Civil Rights 
Commission to issue a ruling on 
the definition back in September. 
Though it was set to make a ruling 
broadening 
the 
definition 
to 

explicitly include gender identity 
and sexual orientation, the CRC 
voted to table it and requested the 
Attorney General’s opinion. Eli 
Savit, a University of Michigan 
law professor and legal aide in the 
efforts, said he believes Michigan 
Attorney General Bill Schuette — 
a current Michigan gubernatorial 
candidate— abused his power to 
prevent this from happening.

Students and faculty voice their opposition to Richard Spencer’s request to speak on campus at the Regents meeting in the Union Tuesday.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

The University of Michigan 

has agreed to proceed with white 
supremacist Richard Spencer’s 
request to speak on campus if the 
University is able to ensure a safe 

setting for the event. University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

announced 
the 
University 

will begin deliberations with 
Spencer’s team regarding time, 
place and nature of the event after 
convening an emergency Board of 
Regents’ meeting Tuesday night.

“We only today have finalized 

plans for how we will proceed 
on Richard Spencer’s request 

to speak on the University of 
Michigan campus,” Schlissel said.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
has not determined a timeline for 
negotiations. In a tweet following 
Schlissel’s 
announcement, 

Kyle Bristow — an attorney for 
Cameron Padgett, the University 
of Georgia student submitting 
requests for Spencer — tweeted 

his deadline for the University’s 
final response has been extended 
to Dec. 8, at penalty of a lawsuit. 
After refusing to allow Spencer 
on campus earlier this year, 
Michigan 
State 
University 

officials are currently engaged in 
a legal mediation with Bristow.

Fitzgerald 
said 
Bristow’s 

ultimatum will have no effect on

Twelve 
students 
from 
the 

University of Michigan’s Climate 
Blue organization just returned to 
campus after attending the 2017 
United Nations Climate Change 
Conference earlier this month in 
Bonn, Germany. This year marked 
the 23rd meeting of the Conference 
of Parties, held under the United 
Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change; the UNFCCC 
is an international treaty that was 
signed at the Rio Earth Summit 
in 1992 to mark the beginning 
of international cooperation in 
addressing climate change.

This year, the UNFCCC’s 197 

parties came together to discuss 
the implementation of the Paris 
agreement. The agreement, which 
was designed during COP21 in 
2015, aimed to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions and curb the global 
temperature rise. However, in June 
2017, President Donald Trump 
announced the United States would 
withdraw from the agreement in 
an effort to preserve jobs.

which discusses climate policy 
across southeast Michigan, began

percent Asian population.

Helmkamp 
said 
he 
also 

believes that with schools such 
as the University of Michigan, 
UW and even the University of 
California, Berkeley — which 
have large student populations 
and 
differences 
in 
diversity 

across the student body — there 
are efforts to bring a lot of 
communities together; he noted 
though he expects attempts to 
build community, there are also 
case-by-case scenarios that need 
to be considered given differences 
among people.

“In 
(the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s) 
case 
(there 
are) 

probably some conversations along 
the lines of, ‘We’re all Wolverines,’ 
and trying to build that sort of 
community with thousands of 
students, some of whom are 
extroverts, some of whom are 
introverts, some of whom are 
rural, some of whom are urban, 
racial 
differences, 
orientation 

differences, international students 
— it’s quite a little experiment,” he 
said. “Each challenge is different.”

Proactive and reactive measures
According 
to 
Helmkamp, 

UW takes a variety of proactive 
measures against bias incidents, 
with the intent of fostering a better 
campus community.

The most significant effort, he 

explained, is the Our Wisconsin 

program, which has just completed 
its second year. It consists of 
several workshops that feature 
structured dialogue and activities, 
according to its website.

“The focus is on incoming new 

students residing in university 
residence halls, which here at 
Madison is about 95 percent of the 
incoming freshman class,” he said. 
“It is essentially an ‘understand 
yourself 
and 
the 
broader 

community, the roles of identity’ 
(program). It’s a community-
building program, we build it 
around the various housing floor 
communities.”

Earlier this month, the school 

hosted its 19th annual diversity 
forum, which consists of notable 
speakers and breakout sessions, 
through which attendees can learn 
about inclusion, microaggressions 
and a variety of other topics.

“(The forum) is a campus-wide 

coming together, reviewing a lot of 
the efforts of the previous year,” he 
said.

On the reactive end, Helmkamp 

explained there are several other 
efforts used for bias incidents. 
Among 
them, 
he 
explained, 

are the student conduct code 
and administrative reports and 
criminal reports.

He explained the university has 

a bias reporting system similar to 
the University of Michigan’s, but 
has been handling bias reporting 
in a more formal way since fall 
2011.

“Over the last year, we’ve kind 

of upped our game with this 

where we now have an up-to-
date, accessible log of the all the 
incidents that are reported to us,” 
he said. “Last February we hired 
a full-time staff member to act as 
our bias response and advocacy 
coordinator, and she responds 
to the reports that come in. We 
respond individually to all reports. 
We offer support to individuals.”

He explained UW addresses 

and tries to reach resolutions 
in situations where it is able to 
identify all of the parties and 
people, and these people are 
willing to come together to work 
things out.

Instances that involve potential 

criminal activity, he explained, 
are referred to the UW-Madison 
Police Department. If it is a 
potential violation of the student 
conduct code, it is referred to the 
Office of Student Conduct and 
Community Standards.

“Interestingly enough, and I 

don’t know how this would slot in 
with other institutions, this past 
spring semester, we received just 
over 90 bias reports for, I believe 
it was, 72 separate incidents,” he 
said. “Of those incidents, only 
two of them were referred on for 
either (the) conduct (process) 
or law enforcement action. The 
great bulk of what we see is really 
incidents between two people, 
whether it’s microaggressions or 
any number of things, but they 
tend to be more interpersonal as 
opposed to conduct or criminal.”

Helmkamp also explained UW 

does not identify any incident as a 

“hate crime.”

“In our world of student affairs 

here at Madison we kind of look 
at it and say, we don’t do crime,” 
he said. “If the police think it’s a 
hate crime, we will let them label 
it. Even in our processes, we don’t 
have categories for people to say, 
‘This was a hate crime.’ In fact, 
we really talk a whole lot more 
about bias incidents than we do 
about hate. We keep open the idea 
that some of the incidents could 
certainly elevate to where it really 
is hate-motivated, but we really 
focus a whole lot more on those 
things that so frequently happen 
between two people that have 
more of a bias flavor to it.”

The University of Michigan 

does declare “hate crimes” on 
campus. It describes them, using 
the U.S. Department of Justice’s 
definition, as crimes or threats 
motivated by an offender’s bias 
against a certain social identity.

In such incidents, Helmkamp 

explained, the bias advocacy and 
response coordinator might get 
involved, sit with the individuals 
and work through receptions, 
issues and concerns. He explained 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
the 

university’s bias response efforts 
are about improving the campus 
community from an education 
perspective, much more than a 
punitive perspective.

Comparatively, according to 

2017 enrollment data from Indiana 
University, 4.4 percent of the 
student body is African American, 

U.S. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich, 

has been accused of secretly 
making a $27,000 settlement for 
a sexual harassment claim by an 
employee in 2015, according to 
a BuzzFeed News report. In the 
article, BuzzFeed reported they 
have received affidavits from four 
former congressional employees 
who claim they had seen Conyers 
making sexual advances toward 
female employees.

The report states that while 

three of these affidavits have been 
notarized, all four come from 
documents within a complaint 
reporting Conyers had “made 
sexual advances to female staff 
that included requests for sex acts, 
contacting and transporting other 
women with whom they believed 
Conyers 
was 
having 
affairs, 

caressing their hands sexually, 
and rubbing their legs and backs 
in public.”

The documents also include 

details of the 2015 dismissal 
complaint settlement, a process 
which the alleged victim described 
to BuzzFeed News as one that 
provided her no other choice but to 
keep her accusations a secret and 
accept the settlement offer.

“I was basically blackballed. 

There was nowhere I could go,” 
she told BuzzFeed News.

Other 
representatives 
have 

spoken 
out 
against 
Conyers, 

calling 
the 
reports 
deeply 

troubling, including Speaker of 
the House Paul Ryan and U.S. Rep. 
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. 

These allegations follow a 

series of other accusations against 
prominent figures in politics and 
other realms including Sen. Al 
Franken, Harvey Weinstein and 
former CBS news anchor Charlie 

Rose.

Later, Conyers confirmed he 

reached a financial settlement 
with the staffer who brought a case 
against him for sexual harassment 
but emphasized he did not admit 
to guilt in the case.

“I expressly and vehemently 

denied 
the 
allegations 
made 

against me, and continue to do so,” 
Conyers said in a statement. “My 
office resolved the allegations — 
with an express denial of liability 
— to save all involved from the 
rigors of protracted litigation. That 
should not be lost in the narrative.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Lincoln 
Merrill, 
press 

correspondent for the University 
of Michigan’s chapter of College 
Republicans, stated that while he 
finds the allegations alarming, 
immediate repercussions for the 
accused perpetrators may not be 
entirely visible.

“The number of allegations 
that have come out in the past 
month is ridiculous. It’s an 
interesting note that on both 
sides of the aisle there’s been 
so many allegations recently,” 
Merrill said. “I don’t think 
it’s going to change anything 
visibly but I think it will change 
people’s 
attitudes 
towards 

government.”

In a statement to The Daily, 

Public Policy junior Lauren 
Schandevel, communications 
director for the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats, 
highlighted 

the importance of looking 
at such issues in a non-
partisan manner, and said the 
organization will be continuing 
to monitor the outcomes of this 
case.

“The reports are troubling 

and we will be watching 
intently over the next few 
weeks 
to 
see 
how 
this 

unfolds,” she wrote. “Charges 
of 
sexual 
misconduct 
are 

extremely serious and should 
be condemned regardless of 
the 
perpetrator’s 
political 

leanings.”

5.6 percent is Hispanic or Latino, 
5.4 percent is Asian, and 66.3 
percent is white. According to the 
2016 U.S. Census Bureau, the state 
of Indiana has a 9.7 percent Black 
or African American population, 
a 6.8 percent Hispanic or Latino 
population, a 2.2 percent Asian 
population and a 79.6 percent 
white population.

Additionally, though Trump 

won the state of Indiana in the 
2016 election, 59.3 percent of 
voters in Monroe County, where 
IU is located, voted for Clinton.

In an email to The Daily, 

April Toler, a news and media 
specialist at Indiana University, 
provided a statement from the 
Nasser H. Paydar, the university’s 
chancellor, 
regarding 
bias 

incidents. 

“(Indiana 
University) 
is 

committed to providing forums 
for the free expression and 
exchange of ideas, including 
those we may not condone. Even 
when we vehemently disagree, 
we must strive to do so with 
mutual respect and civility,” 
the 
statement 
reads. 
“Open 

dialogue is central to academic 
freedom and our educational 
mission. The university abhors 
all forms of racism, bigotry 
and discrimination, including 
discrimination based on religious 
beliefs or political views.”

Stella Shaffer, a transgender 

woman, graduated from IU in 
spring 2017. She described IU’s 
campus climate as complicated 
but “polite.” As a result, she said 
a lot of people end up saying 
nothing.

“I think a lot of people are 

supportive and don’t know how 
to actually engage with that,” she 
said.

She said she thinks people who 

are hostile toward trans people 
and the LGBTQ community don’t 
necessarily want to say anything 
because they don’t want to be 
labeled as bigots.

“I feel like what happens is — 

with this culture of silence — I 
was walking through a campus 
where people actively either 
stared at me when they thought 
I wasn’t looking or actively tried 
to avoid eye contact or engaging 
with me in any sort of meaningful 
way,” she said.

In a later email, Shaffer 

explained, IU has taken some 
measures to make the campus 
more welcoming for LGBTQ 
students. 
Specifically, 
they’ve 

opened 
an 
LGBTQ 
housing 

space that she said she assumes 
would be friendly to transgender 
students and their housing needs.

“As new buildings are being 

built, they’re also doing a pretty 
good job of adding in some 
gender neutral bathroom spaces, 
which, of course, impact trans 
people enormously,” she wrote. 
“Not only do plenty of binary 
trans people not feel comfortable 
using the bathroom sometimes, 
but a binary bathroom system 
completely excludes non-binary 
folks.”

She also spoke on IU’s approval 

of an update to the undergraduate 
curriculum that includes a social 
justice component — something 
she is very pleased with. It would 
require students to take a certain 
number of classes pertaining to 
race and ethnicity or gender and 
sexuality.

Though Shaffer wrote she was 

not fully aware of the details, she 
explained IU had been slow to 
implement the new classes.

“As far as I’m aware, the 

administration specifically has 
been dragging its feet for a few 
years on implementing this new 
policy, despite the fact that it was 
introduced and approved by the 
most powerful and influential 
board of IU faculty on campus,” 
she wrote.

Lindsay Ewell is a senior 

at 
Northwestern 
University’s 

School of Communication. In 
an email, Ewell wrote certain 
groups feel marginalized on the 
Northwestern campus; however, 
she 
noted 
an 
emphasis 
on 

academic performance.

“The NU campus climate is 

very isolated, in part because 
of the pressure to perform well 
academically,” she wrote. “Some 
POC groups are close knit 
because of a mutual appreciation 
for NU’s struggles, but there’s still 
a clear differentiation between 
groups. I can certainly say that a 
lot of POCs and POC groups feel 
marginalized on campus.”

According to 2016 enrollment 

data for the class of 2020 at 
Northwestern, 8.5 percent of the 
student population is Black or 
African American, 13.6 percent 
is Hispanic or Latino, 20 percent 
is Asian and 46 percent is white. 
Comparatively, according to the 
2016 U.S. Census Bureau, the state 
of Illinois has a 14.7 percent Black 
or African American population, 
a 17 percent Hispanic or Latino 
population, a 5.5 percent Asian 
population and a 61.7 percent 
white population.

advocate for the investigation of 
companies in which the University 
of Michigan is invested that are 
tied to the violation of Palestinian 
human rights do so because they 
believe in advocating for what 
is just. I believe the authors and 
advocates of this resolution do not 
intend to target Jewish people, and 
I do not believe that criticism of 
Israel is inherently anti-Semitic.”

Sarkar outlined three specific 

points in her statement: First, she 
wrote she does not believe the 
Boycott, Divest and Sanctions 
Movement is completely distinct 
from advocacy for divestment; 
second, Sarkar said the refusal to 
allow Prof. Victor Lieberman to 
speak at last week’s meeting has 
since activated uncontextualized 
dialogue about the issue; and third, 
Sarkar wrote there is a necessity to 
address the fact that disagreement 
does not mean silencing.

“Ultimately, the spirit of this 

resolution is to elevate the voices of 
students who believe in protecting 
Palestinian 
human 
rights,” 

Sarkar wrote. “The spirit of the 
resolution embodies the University 
of Michigan’s mission statement 
— to challenge the present — and 
the University’s vision statement, 
which specifically says that we must 
dedicate ourselves to responsible 
stewardship of financial resources.”

Sarkar ended her letter noting 

she finds the assembly’s request to 
be reasonable.

“It is time for this issue to be 

elevated to the Board of Regents, 
regardless of the decision that it 
chooses to make on this question; 
in coming years, I am hopeful that 
the advocacy around this issue will 
continue to grow inclusively under 
the framework of community-
building and finding common 
ground,” Sarkar wrote. 

On 
Monday 
evening, 
the 

University of Michigan chapter of 
SAFE met with E. Royster Harper, 
vice president for Student Life, and 
Laura Blake Jones, dean of students, 
for a dialogue and conversation. 
Approximately 20 students were 
in attendance to discuss relevant 
campus 
climate 
and 
safety 

concerns, as well as the recently 
passed #UMDivestresolution.

The resolution passed for the 

first time in the University’s Ann 
Arbor campus history last Tuesday, 
and the results have been met with 
intense emotions across campus.

In 
an 
interview 
with 
the 

Daily, Harper explained her own 
thoughts on the resolution, and 
stated administration would be 
continuing their policies in making 
investment decisions based on 
financial 
reasonings. 
Harper 

also mentioned efforts from the 
administration in keeping targeted 
communities safe.

“We have Jewish students that 

are worried about their safety; we 
have Muslim and Arab students 
that are worried about their safety,” 
Harper said. “So we have a pretty 
active Department of Public Safety 
right now trying to be attuned 
to and mindful of this, and this 
conversation in the context of a 
national conversation.”

The administrators present at 

Monday’s dialogue declined to 
comment on specificities of the 
event. The Daily did not attend the 
meeting due to the personal nature 
of the event, but spoke to several 
student attendees afterwards.

LSA senior Andrea Sahouri 

attended the dialogue, and stated 
one of the most important aspects 
of the conversation was the way 
it exposed students to University 
officials that are open to hearing 
concerns, specifically for those 
students who may be feeling the 
administration is not intimately 
connected to conversation among 
the student body.

“I think the most important 

part of the meeting as a whole 
was letting the students of SAFE, 
and the community that SAFE 
brings together, letting them know 
that administration is available 
to them,” she said. “Throughout 
my whole college career I never 
felt 
comfortable 
to 
contact 

administration because I didn’t 
know that they were there for us.”

LSA senior Haleemah Aqel 

echoed similar sentiments towards 
the administrations’ presence, but 
also spoke of the unbiased nature 
under which the administrators 
confirmed they will be taking 
action.

“The thing that they emphasized 

is they obviously can’t take sides, 
which is obviously understandable, 
but just showing that if we ever 
need... to go to them or talk to them 
about anything that they’re there 
for us as students,” she said.

Another main point of discussion 

was 
safety 
concerns 
among 

students following #UMDivest.

While parts of the resolution 

were addressed, the conversation 
mostly focused on overall concerns 
of the students present, with 
administration 
reiterating 
the 

importance of students standing up 
for their own beliefs and not letting 
others take away this voice.

“At the end of the day they left us 

with the message that people are 
never going to agree with you all the 
time,” Sahouri said. “Sometimes 
you just have to really keep fighting 
for what you believe in and then 
focus your efforts on continuing 
that fight rather than focusing your 
efforts on people who are trying to 
bring you down.”

Students in opposition to the 

resolution were present at the 
dialogue, according to Sahouri. 
These students were not asked to 
leave the room, as Sahouri stated 
the SAFE members are open to 
others listening to their concerns.

While some students, according 

to Sahouri, feel discouraged the 

administration cannot take any 
immediate 
tangible 
action 
in 

solving marginalization on campus, 
she highlighted the opportunity 
to 
speak 
with 
administration 

was 
helpful, 
and 
she 
hopes 

such 
dialogues 
will 
continue 

in the future so as to affirm the 
University’s presence in hearing 
student concerns.

“I just thought it was cathartic 

to speak with someone who’s not 
in your own community about how 
you’re feeling,” Sahouri said. “It 
just feels like you’re finally being 
listened to.”

Outside of CSG, students in other 

organizations such as the Black 
Student Union and Latinx Alliance 
for Community Action, Support 
and Advocacy have supported the 
#UMDivest resolution.

This comes in contrast to a 

statement released by University 
of Michigan Hillel on Tuesday, in 
which members expressed their 
disagreement with the resolution.

Joshua Blum, chair of Hillel’s 

Governing Board and an LSA 
senior, sent the statement along 
with several other members of the 
board.

“While there is a diversity of 

thought 
toward 
Israel 
within 

our community, many students 
were united in feeling hurt by the 
rhetoric used to address the one 
Jewish State and our community,” 
the 
statement 
reads. 
“Anti-

Semitism manifests itself in many 
different ways. Some forms of 
anti-Semitism are more obvious 
such as Nazi marches, painted 
swastikas, and alt-Right chants. 
Contemporary 
anti-Semitism 

takes the form of subtle remarks, 
micro-aggressions, and reinforcing 
negative stereotypes of the Jewish 
community. We saw many of 
these injustices in Tuesday night’s 
meeting.”

The statement also touched on 

the denial of Lieberman’s presence 
calling it “silencing”.

“When Jewish representatives 

spoke about their experiences 
with 
anti-Semitism 
and 
anti-

Israel rhetoric, their concerns 
were dismissed,” the statement 
from Hillel reads. “Proponents 
of Divestment held up ‘silencing’ 
signs each time they heard a 
statement they disagreed with. The 
hypocrisy of silencing others while 
claiming to be silenced themselves, 
is antithetical to Michigan’s value 
of the free exchange of ideas. 
All students’ perspectives and 
identities are valid and should not 
be selectively silenced.”

The University has yet to release 

any action with regard to the 
resolution’s passing, but University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald noted 
last Thursday that the University’s 
investment 
portfolio 
must 
be 

diversified to best assist the 
University in its overall educational 
missions.

as a blog created by a delegation of 
University community members 
who attended COP15 in 2009. 
Today it reaches graduate students, 
professors and business people, 
among others who focus on different 
areas of study across the country. 
The organization continues to send 
a delegation, comprised of students 
and faculty, to the conference 
each year. The conference itself 
primarily consists of negotiations 
among parties and side events, 
which serve as platforms for 
“observer organizations” — like 
the Climate Blue delegation — who 
don’t speak in formal negotiations, 
according to the UNFCCC website. 
Side event participants can engage 
with parties and other attendees to 
network and share ideas.

Rackham student Matt Irish, 

who is studying for master’s degrees 
in Applied Climate Science and 
Electrical Engineering, attended 
this year’s conference as well as 
COP21. He explained at COP21 there 
was a lot of fanfare and excitement 
as national leaders came together to 
sign the Paris agreement; however, 
he said after the signing there was 
still work to be done.

“(During COP21), the leaders 

came the first week actually to kind 
of say, ‘Hey, we’re here signing off 
on it, now make it happen,’” he said. 
“There was some real stuff that 
needed to get done but because they 
had that sort of front-loaded thing, 
the idea was that those national 
leaders put their name on it and they 

had it done … since we just really 
wanted to agree, that was mainly 
all that happened. There were some 
really important parts of the text 
that were extremely vague that 
were left to be figured out later. This 
year was when that actually had to 
happen.”

This 
year 
at 
COP23, 

Irish 
explained, 
leaders 
and 

representatives were charged with 
“writing the rulebook” to implement 
what they agreed upon in Paris. He 
explained COP23 was an exciting 
opportunity to substantiate some 
of the more abstract concepts in the 
Paris agreement.

Pertinent to the conference, 

Irish explained, was whether the 
United States would be involved in 
certain parts at all, given Trump’s 
announcement.

“What I was most excited about, 

personally from this last week, was 
that it seems to me that … in the 
past it was everyone waiting — is 
the U.S. going to play? Is the U.S. 
in? The question was, what’s going 
to happen to the world if the U.S. 
is in or not?” he said. “And now, 
because the Paris agreement has 
been signed and we’re kind of past 
it, I feel like … the questions is more, 
what’s going to happen to the U.S. if 
the U.S. isn’t in?”

Rackham 
student 
Samantha 

Basile is a Ph.D. student in the 
Department of Climate and Space 
Sciences and Engineering. She is 
the director of the Climate Blue, and 
attended this year’s conference.

Basile explained the official 

United States delegation was really 
only present in name. She said the 
other nations had already agreed to 
work without them.

Basile herself spent a lot of time 

in negotiations, and said it was 
interesting to see how all of the 
nations’ voices come together to 
agree on certain steps that need to 
be taken. She said such agreements 
are sometimes taken for granted.

“We assume that things aren’t 

moving fast enough and we get very 
frustrated as students, especially 
because we see, we just have so 
much energy and we want things 
to move forward,” she said. “So it 
was a little frustrating to see things 
get kicked down the road, but at 
the same time, they’re keeping 
everyone on board and keeping 
everyone under a consensus vote 
system so it’s pretty amazing that 
they get anything done.”

Environment and Sustainability 

graduate student Chris Karounos 
is pursuing his master’s degree 
in 
Environmental 
Informatics 

and Conservation Ecology. He 
said going into the conference he 
underestimated the “goodwill” of 
everyone involved in negotiations.

“It seemed like everyone had 

their hearts in the right place and 
it really needed to be that way 
because you’re in a room of at least 
50 different upper-level delegates 
that were representing an entire 
country, and they all had to agree on 
something,” he said.

Karounos said it was rewarding 

to be a “fly on the wall” in the 
negotiation process.

“We’re really serving a purpose 

by being there as students,” he said. 
“(Initially), I thought it was kind of a 
fluff thing, but the U.N. really wants 
it to be a transparent process.”

Environment and Sustainability 

graduate 
student 
Tyler 
Fitch 

explained the dynamic among 
conference attendees operates much 
like a bureaucratic power structure. 
He said a lot of the negotiations are 
closed to non-party entities and he 
said most delegates tend to keep to 
themselves. However, he said there 
are a lot of open discussions fostered 
by the side events.

Some student delegations work 

directly with countries, taking notes 
for them and helping them navigate 
their 
schedules. 
The 
Climate 

Blue delegation, Basile explained, 
worked specifically with the United 
Nations Secretariat, which allowed 
them to interact with the formal 
process.

Rackham student Cesar Luis 

Barraza Botet, an international 
student 
from 
Colombia, 
said 

he approached the Colombian 
delegation.

Barraza Botet said the groups 

discussed specific topics or articles 
in the Paris Agreement in the 
plenary sessions. One article, he 
explained, discusses technology 
mechanisms, which requires the 
development of mitigation and 
adaptation technologies as well as 
the ability to transfer them from 
developed countries to developing 
countries. 

“It was amazing to me how they 

had to agree on every single word 
that was going into these rulebook 
documents,” he said.

In terms of side events, Rackham 

student Emily Gargulinski — who 
is pursuing a master’s degree in the 
Climate and Space Sciences and 
Engineering department — said 
they took place in what is called the 
Bonn Zone. The zone comprised 
country pavilions — spaces in which 

each country could exhibit their 
culture and display their climate 
change initiatives. The exhibitions 
comprised of small booths that 
displayed new technology and 
initiatives. There were also meeting 
rooms that held side events on 
topics such as nuclear power and 
sustainable cities.

One key component of the 

delegation’s COP experience is 
the Climate Blue blog. Through 
their blogs, members can reflect on 
conference highlights.

“We tried to set it up as a 

system where everyone could be 
involved, but hopefully wouldn’t 
be 
overwhelmed, 
because 
we 

knew the negotiations would be 
overwhelming in itself,” Basile 
said. “Everyone participated on 
the Twitter, on our social media, 
and then our requirement was 
either before, during or after COP, 
you would write one blog kind of 
reflecting on a certain topic. We 
didn’t want it to just be like a diary 
entry, we wanted it to have a little 
more of a perspective behind it.”

In his blog, Fitch discussed the 

We Are Still In movement, which 
comprises cities, companies and 
universities that support action to 
implement the Paris agreement 
despite Trump’s intent to withdraw. 
According to Fitch, there was 
a series of events related to this 
movement at the conference.

Additionally, in October, Climate 

Blue and Michigan and The Climate 
Crisis wrote a letter to University 
President Mark Schlissel asking 
him to sign the We Are Still In 
pledge on behalf of the University, 
which he did.

“I think the conference was sort 

of a, ‘What is the next step for We 
Are Still In?’ And frankly I don’t 
think they know yet, but the idea 
is that … the We Are Still In folks 
are going to keep abreast of these 
negotiations and continue to make 
climate action happen in the United 
States,” he said. “(The University 
of) Michigan is a part of that which 
means it’s all the more relevant for 
us.”

Irish 
explained 
though 
the 

United States government did not 
have a climate pavilion of its own at 
the conference this year, there was 
a We Are Still In pavilion area that 
became the United States’ de facto 
location and was bigger than past 
federal pavilions.

“The idea is just telling the rest of 

the world that we have federalism 
in the United States — the federal 
government doesn’t get to call the 
shots on everything so in a very real 
sense the U.S. is ‘still in,’” he said.

Noting that the United States 

plays a large role in mitigating 
climate 
change, 
Irish 
also 

explained the rest of the world 
has responsibilities as well. He 
explained the bottom-up approach 
to reducing emissions outlined in 
the Paris agreement, which allows 
each country to bring their own 
emission reduction proposal to 
the table, and to which all parties 
agreed.

“The good thing is it finally 

helped all the countries build trust 
together to actually want to do 
something and try to make this 
virtuous cycle, but the bad thing is 
there is absolutely no guarantee that 
we’re actually going to meet our 
goals,” he said.

the University’s decisions.

Schlissel 
outlined 

three 
components 
of 
his 

decision: The University can 
impose 
restrictions 
on 
the 

circumstances 
of 
the 
event 

based on the First Amendment, 
but not content; denying the 
request would attract more 
public attention to Spencer; and 
protecting free speech is key 
in maintaining a democratic 
society.

Schlissel 
and 
University 

spokespeople 
emphasized 

repeatedly student safety is the 
administrators’ priority. Close 
to 75 students at the meeting 
jeered the officials, holding up 
signs and yelling. 

Though the Board could not 

act in an official capacity on 
Schlissel’s action, many weighed 
in. University Regent Denise 

Ilitch (D) was the only regent to 
contend the president’s decision.

“Unfortunately, 
I 
do 
not 

agree with the University of 
Michigan 
administration,” 

she 
said. 
“While 
I 
am 
a 

staunch proponent of the First 
Amendment, and stand firmly 
in support of our constitution, 
I remain very concerned that it 
is unsafe to allow him to speak 
at the University of Michigan. 
Violence follows him wherever 
he goes.”

During 
public 
comments, 

every speaker — and many more 
students speaking out of turn 
during the meeting — argued 
Spencer’s appearance on campus 
is an inherent threat to safety.

Nursing 
graduate 
student 

Vidhya 
Aravind 
noted 
the 

proximity 
and 
strength 
of 

white supremacist groups near 
the University, saying an event 
with Spencer on campus would 
undoubtedly attract them.

“There’s 
nothing 
to 
be 

learned from his viewpoint, 
nor can we learn anything from 
challenging it,” she said. “This 
dehumanization validates and 
affirms the views of hate groups 
like Identity Evropa, who has 
a base of organization within 
a half hour of the University. 
Bringing him will embolden 
local white supremacists to 
continue to violent protesting, 
and will risk physical violence or 
murder.”

Rackham student Brittney 

Williams pointed out the ways in 
which Spencer’s views were an 
attack on her identity as a Black, 
bisexual woman — referencing 
his beliefs that Black people do 
not deserve to exist. Williams 
noted it was important for the 
Board to consider the gravity 
of allowing Spencer into a place 
many students considered their 
home.

Particularly 
troubling 

for students, the GOP tax 
bill 
greatly 
undervalues 

education. For one, student 
loan repayment will no longer 
be tax deductible. Currently, 
44 million borrowers owe $1.3 
trillion in student loan debt in 
the U.S. As such, this legislation 
would make a college education 
much more unaffordable for the 
average American. 

Graduate 
education 
takes 

a 
much 
bigger 
hit. 
Under 

the Section 117 (d)(5) of the 
House 
tax 
plan, 
graduate 

school tuition waivers will be 
considered 
taxable 
income, 

rendering an already meager 
income 
unlivable. 
Given 

most 
graduate 
students 

receive 
funding 
primarily 

through teaching or research 
assistantships, 
taxing 
these 

waivers as income may make 
pursuing graduate education 
financially 
difficult 
for 

students, particularly students 
of lower socioeconomic status.

This legislation relies on 

a misunderstanding of what 
a graduate level education 
actually is. Graduate students 
do not get paid for sitting in 
classrooms all day; rather, 
teaching 
and 
contributing 

to 
research 
serve 
as 

indispensable parts of the 
graduate 
education. 
This 

work 
is 
notoriously 
time-

demanding 
and 
deserving 

of compensation. As such, 
the United States’s research 
productivity — particularly 

in the sciences — will likely 
take a big hit, because it isn’t 
unreasonable for prospective 
graduate 
students, 
who 

conduct much of the research 
done in the U.S., to look abroad 
for their graduate degrees or 
forgo earning one altogether. 

The economic justifications 

for the GOP tax plan reflect 
a flawed knowledge of the 
efficacy of economic policies. 
The tax plan will add anywhere 
between $1.5 trillion and $1.7 
trillion to the deficit and, 
while many senators argue 
the added economic activity 
will make up for the increase, 
most 
economists 
disagree. 

This, in conjunction with the 
prioritization of corporations 
in 
the 
plan, 
illustrates 

Republicans’ 
continued 

adherence 
to 
the 
concept 

of 
trickle-down 
economics. 

Their support of this economic 
idealogy signifies a disregard 
for the popular consensus in 
the economic community of 
the fallacies of the success of 
these policies.

Nevertheless, even if we 

assumed 
that 
trickle-down 

economics 
were 
a 
viable 

solution, the tax plan is still 
flawed. The writers of the 
bill justify treating graduate 
school 
tuition 
waivers 
as 

taxable income by saying it 
is 
non-spendable 
and 
will 

therefore not contribute to 
increasing economic activity. 
However, higher enrollment 
costs will likely cause graduate 

school enrollment rates to 
fall, stalling any potential for 
trickle down before it can even 
begin, as fewer people overall 
will have degrees that will give 
them more money to spend in 
the economy.

Additionally, 
this 
tax 

bill fails people outside of 
higher educational contexts. 
The reduction in corporate 
tax rates will prioritize the 
needs 
of 
large 
corporate 

interests over the needs of the 
most 
vulnerable, 
including 

students 
and 
people 
of 

lower socioeconomic status. 
Everyday workers will see less 
economic activity, and will 
be subject to higher costs in 
many areas.

For example, teachers and 

medical 
professionals 
will 

no longer be able to write off 
expenses 
for 
supplies 
and 

other 
expenses 
they 
incur 

at work. Furthermore, the 
removal 
of 
the 
Individual 

Health 
Insurance 
Mandate, 

a part of Obamacare, would 
likely lead to higher insurance 
prices across the board. This 
plan will strip Americans of 
needed health care coverage 
while funneling savings to the 
wealthiest corporate interests.

This is a bad tax plan 

overall 
and 
works 
against 

our country’s ideals. We urge 
the Senate to change these to 
protect not only the interests 
of 
graduate 
students, 
but 

also of the general American 
population.

A

s all new years begin, 
resolutions are created. 
So, as the fall semester 

approached this year, a few 
friends and I made a resolution 
to be more physically active this 
semester. Whether it was to walk 
more, bike, run or attend cycling 
and yoga classes, we planned to 
encourage each other to see this 
resolution through.

With the intention to be a 

more active human, when I heard 
the news that my housemates 
were 
deciding 
to 
form 
an 

intramural soccer team in the 
non-competitive league, I jumped 
at the chance to join. The last 
time I played soccer was in sixth 
grade when everyone made the 
team. I didn’t make the team the 
following year in seventh grade 
because I kept tripping over my 
feet during the scrimmage game 
in tryouts. This would be a great 
shot for my second try where I 
could be active and put myself 
outside of my comfort zone.

I have never called myself an 

athlete, but I have always tried 
my best because I love being a 
part of a team. Arriving at our first 
game, I could feel butterflies in my 
stomach walking toward the field 
of players. My team of housemates 
began warming up and passing 
the ball back and forth with skill 
and finesse. I was shocked by their 
abilities, energy and talent. I soon 
realized that most have played 
soccer competitively and our 
team of competitors shared these 
characteristics as well.

In general, competitive sports 

have an ability to bond people. 
People could have nothing in 
common, but with a ball and a 
net, individuals from drastically 
different 
lives 
can 
share 
a 

common goal wanting their team 
to win. To me, framing sports in 
this light makes athleticism sound 

quite beautiful. And there I see the 
greatness in this team camaraderie 
and lessons individuals can learn 
from group cooperation. But this 
doesn’t mean competitive sports 
are for everyone.

The game began and I was on 

the sidelines, anxiously hoping 
there was some way I didn’t have 
to sub for someone who was in. But 
with time, one of my teammates 
wanted some time to rest, and I 
tied up my borrowed cleats and 
ran in. My time on the field was a 
blur. My heart beat out of my chest 
as I ran up and down the field. I 
think I may have made contact 
with the ball once or twice. When 
the half was over, I was happy to 
go back on the sidelines.

When the game ended, I 

honestly felt traumatized by this 
small experience. I know that may 
sound dramatic. Looking around 
at my smiling teammates who 
gained so much joy from their 
time on the field, I reflected on my 
own feelings of panic and anxiety. 
At this point, I knew this wasn’t 
the right activity for me.

I spent the next week after 

the game hoping there was a 
way I didn’t have to play again. 
Luckily enough, I found myself 
with a horrible ingrown toenail 
from wearing borrowed cleats 
that were just too tight. With this 
strong excuse, I knew I would be 
able to sit out and not play. Sharing 
this news with my teammates, 
I felt a rush of embarrassment. 
I felt like I failed myself and the 
team. I didn’t want to leave my 
team at a disadvantage, but I 
knew playing again would only 
make me feel worse.

Normally, I find I’m a group-

oriented thinker, but in this case, I 
found that I needed to do what was 
best for myself. And I think overall 
this was better for the team. I 
still showed up to our games and 

drove a car full of teammates to 
the field. I even had a friend fill in 
for me and play very last minute. 
This way, I wasn’t putting myself 
in a situation that made me feel 
too uncomfortable because in that 
space one cannot grow.

In an effort to try new things 

and be active, I ended up feeling 
embarrassed and ashamed. I don’t 
think this feeling is necessary to 
be an active, social person. Since 
this event, I have been throwing 
myself 
into 
non-competitive 

physical activities like yoga and 
bike rides. Here I can still hold 
up my resolution and do it on my 
own terms.

It is important to remember 

we all have different skills that 
we bring into our group and team 
dynamics. I have found myself in 
similar settings in course group 
projects as well. A group relies 
on the strength of its individuals 
who are there for each other. 
In my projects where my group 
members cared for and valued 
each others’ ideas, skills and time, 
the group performed better and 
had better outcomes. If everyone 
makes an effort to think about the 
group first, the group will have a 
good outcome.

This indicates that we are 

only as strong as the strength 
of the individuals who make up 
our groups and teams. When we 
form this trust with our group 
members, we must do this with 
ourselves as well. When we 
know everyone is looking out 
for one another, the team trusts 
that you will take the time and 
energy 
for 
self-care. 
These 

group dynamics are complex, 
but with folks who care, it 
can truly make an impact for 
everyone involved.

FROM THE DAILY

A bad tax plan overall

O

n Nov. 16, the House of Representatives passed their version 
of a tax bill. The bill aims to overhaul many Obama-era tax 
legislations, including the Obamacare health care mandate 

aimed at reducing overall health care costs, in order to facilitate tax 
breaks for the wealthiest Americans. Furthermore, the bill hurts 
those in higher education by implementing higher taxes on students. 
This tax bill is incredibly detrimental to students, the general U.S. 
population and the economy, and we urge the Senate to revise it entirely.

Editor’s note: The writer’s name

L

ast year, I was sitting in 
class and out of nowhere 
our 
graduate 
student 

instructor started talking about 
a case where football players 
sexually 
assaulted 
a 
female 

student at a Texas university. As I 
sat digesting what I was hearing, 
I could feel my face get hot, my 
heartbeat quicken. I could feel 
my eyes start to water. I knew 
I was about to cry but I held it 
in. Finally, we broke into small 
group discussions and I excused 
myself to go to the bathroom.

I had barely stepped into 

the hallway when I began to 
sob uncontrollably. My brain 
was simultaneously numb and 
overstimulated with a thousand 
different thoughts, and they 
were overwhelming me to the 
point that I had no idea what to 
do with myself. So, I paced. In 
those few moments, all of what 
had happened to me freshman 
year was made worse by the fact 
I had become visibly upset in 
public and in front of my peers.

To make matters worse, in 

an effort to hide my distress 
from my peers, I now had to try 
to conceal my meltdown from 
strangers in the hallway. I was 
trying to do the impossible: shut 
down memories that had a habit 
of reemerging up like the moles 
in that Whack-A-Mole game — 
erratically, suddenly and in the 
worst moments.

A few moments later, my GSI 

stepped out of the classroom to 
find me. For a little while, we sat 
together on the stairs silently.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered. 

“I’m so, so sorry.” 

That was all she could say. I 

could tell she knew what had 
made me so upset, but because 
of her obligation as a GSI to 
report sexual violence, she 
didn’t say much more. And I 
thank her for that.

After some time, she had to 

go back to class before other 
students could wonder why she 
had disappeared for so long. I 
stayed put in the hallway.

She came back a little later 

with the belongings I’d left 
behind. She was kind and caring. 
I am grateful every day that I had 

a GSI as understanding as she 
was. But in that moment, I felt 
like a bug under a microscope 
— like every move I made was 
being watched.

When I finally started to head 

home, I walked at lightning speed 
to avoid human interaction at all 
costs. I had a meeting in less than 
an hour, but there was no way I 
was going to make it. Not in one 
piece, at least. So, after sending a 
vague and potentially alarming 
email to my professor, I crawled 
into bed. That’s where I stayed 
for a better part of the afternoon, 
feeling uncontrollably upset, as if 
what happened three years ago 
had happened yesterday.

***

My freshman year, I got a 

boy’s number at a party. A few 
months later, I went to his house. 
I hadn’t put everything together 
as I made my way over, but when 
I stepped into his room, I almost 
immediately 
started 
feeling 

scared and uneasy. I realized 
what was about to happen. But he 
was bigger in size, intimidatingly 
so. I didn’t know anyone in his 
house, and I knew I wouldn’t 
be able to figure out how to get 
home. I was trapped. So that’s 
where I stayed. Trapped.

This night turned my world 

completely upside down. For a 
while, I was almost always on 
edge, always looking around me 
to make sure he wasn’t there. 
I was startled by people who 
resembled him; I would begin to 
breath heavily, my face would get 
hot, my throat would constrict. 
I would hear my heartbeat in 
my ears. Now it’s gotten a little 
easier, but I still shudder when 
something reminds me of what 
happened or when a random 
thought of that night intrudes 
my headspace. And there are still 
moments when I think I’ve seen 
him and I panic.

“You look like you’ve seen a 

ghost,” one of my friends said 
to me one day after I could have 
sworn I saw him on the street. I 
smiled awkwardly.

“I’ve just had a day,” I told her.
The summer between my 

freshman and sophomore years 
was the hardest. I had only 
told one person about what 
happened, 
and, 
more 
than 

anything, I hated myself. I felt 
stupid and ashamed that I’d been 
in that situation, because I felt 
responsible. To this day, I still 

often question whether I could 
have done something differently.

That summer, I was very 

quiet and I stayed in bed a lot. 
There were times when I just 
felt overcome with sadness. I 
looked sad, too, and my mom 
would ask me if everything was 
alright. It wasn’t, but I told her it 
was. She and I are best friends, 
and I could tell she knew 
something was wrong, but just 
the thought of telling her sends 
me into a panic.

***

I can never be 100 percent 

sure what would have changed 
had I known beforehand what 
we were going to talk about 
that day in my discussion. But I 
do know I was not prepared. As 
a result, I couldn’t participate 
in the conversation. We should 
never shy away from talking 
about sexual assault because 
it’s important, but it’s equally 
important to give survivors 
the tools to allow them to 
comfortably talk about these 
things. Just a simple email or a 
note in the syllabus when a class 
is talking about a topic that could 
elicit a very emotional reaction 
would help immensely.

So, no. I don’t want trigger 

warnings so I can skip out on 
class. They aren’t so I can shelter 
myself. I’m not asking that we 
water down these important 
conversations to accommodate 
survivors. 
Trigger 
warnings 

would allow me to participate 
in these tough discussions with 
my peers because I would know 
what to expect.

When I found myself in this 

situation last semester, I had 
no time to stop for a moment 
and breathe. It was all hitting 
me like a train that I couldn’t 
stop. I was glued to the tracks 
and couldn’t step off. So, the 
next time you question the 
importance of trigger warnings 
or roll your eyes because you 
think that it’s politically correct 
culture “back at it again,” think 
about if you were me. What 
would you want?

RCA/SONY

Two years ago he told us that Buffalo revived his career and that’s the most that city’s done
‘Oblivion’ is the comeback 
none of us asked T-Pain for

The new release finds T-Pain trying, failing to reinvent himself

Louis 
Menand, 
a 
staff 

writer for the New Yorker, 
postulated “The Iron Law of 
Stardom,” which states that a 
star can only coincide with the 
zeitgeist for three years before 
the world moves on. Someone 
needs to frame that article 
and give it to T-Pain, because 
his 
latest 
album, 
Oblivion, 

released last Thursday, Nov. 
17, feels like the efforts of a 
man struggling in vain to swim 
against a current that’s leaving 
him behind.

T-Pain, the former chart-

topper, 
now 
finds 
himself 

making lukewarm dancehall 
pop numbers (“No Rush”) and 
halfhearted 
trap 
anthems. 

How did it come to this?

The answer is that T-Pain is 

trying to be two artists at once 
on Oblivion — he is trying to 

keep up with what is currently 
popular while retaining his 
signature style, but the end 
result is a work that feels 
aimless and devoid of artistic 
meaning. In attempting to be 
both a trapper and a poppy 
R&B 
singer, 
he 
stretches 

himself much too thin, leading 
to an album that comes off as 
half-assed and derivative.

I’m 
making 
this 
album 

sound worse than it really is. 
It’s actually not half bad; “Your 
Friend” and “Second Chance 
(Don’t 
Back 
Down),” 
for 

example, are both enjoyable if 
not spectacular. In fact, there 
is nothing inherently “bad” 
about most of this album, 
as many of the songs are 
energetic, catchy and utterly 
inoffensive. 
T-Pain’s 
vocals 

are as fun as ever, and there 
is no denying that he has a 
knack for catchy melodies. The 
problem is that Oblivion just 
doesn’t have the same magic 
that T-Pain had from ’06 to ’08, 
when he was perfect for his 
time and place, and it feels like 
a hollow imitation as a result.

A 
few 
particular 
low 

points: “That Comeback” is 
an attempted pop anthem that 
lacks any form of charisma 
and is quite possibly the worst 
track T-Pain has ever released. 
Don’t listen to it. “Goal Line” is 
an attempt at an industrial trap 
sound that falls flat on its face 
from the get-go, not helped by 

an uninspiring feature from 
Blac Youngsta.

In his article Menand claims 

two exceptions to his three-
year rule: If stars reinvent 
themselves, as the Beatles and 

Kanye West have done, they 
may be able to be at one with 
the zeitgeist for an additional 
three years. It is too late for 
T-Pain to go down this path; 
he is too far removed from 
the cutting edge. The other 
exception is that stars can 
have a three-year “revival,” 
where an artist experiences 
a resurgence borne of mass 
nostalgia, 
which 
may 
yet 

happen for Pain, but likely not 
as a result of this new release.

This 
wave 
of 
nostalgia 

is the force by which we 
could conceivably see T-Pain 
restored to cultural relevancy, 
a 
society 
of 
millennials 

wishing to return to the idyllic 
days of halcyon youth through 
the crooning king of Auto-
Tune. Until then, he would 
do well to not try to catch up 
with a cultural milieu that has 
passed him by, and instead 
embrace the style that made 
him so influential in the first 
place. 

COURTESY OF CARLY YASHINKSY

This past week’s performance by the Friars
Multi-purposing venues: 
The Pink Seat Project is 
both aware & entertaining

What can a seat do?
“When people first walk in, they 

see the pink seat, the immediate 
reaction is ‘what is that?’”

It can spark a question.
“He was crying when he saw 

this pink seat.”

It can provoke a reaction.
A seat can be more than a place 

to sit and watch a performance. It 
can have philanthropic powers. 
In the seventh grade, College 
of 
Engineering 
Senior 
Adam 

Lassman had a realization when 
he saw an advertisement featuring 
Ted Williams’s red seat at Fenway. 
“It signifies that a feat was 
accomplished,” (the longest home-
run hit in Fenway), Lassman said 
in an interview with the Michigan 
Daily, “and I remember thinking 
‘That’s one seat, and that’s a sea 
of seats ... One seat could make an 
impact.’”

When he earned a service 

fellowship during his senior year of 
high school, Lassman capitalized 
on the visual and fiscal powers of 
a seat by creating the Pink Seat 
Project, “a non-profit organization 
that works to establish pink seats in 
entertainment venues, and all the 
ticket sales from those seats go to 
local breast cancer organizations.”

In the entertainment industry, 

venues are rented out by the people 
putting on the production, and thus 
the aesthetics of the space are up to 
their discretion. With permission 
from the producers, The Pink Seat 
Project temporarily installs pink 
seats at entertainment venues for 
specific performances.

During the span of the The 

Pink Seat Project’s inaugural year, 
Lassman installed nine pink seats 
in his local area of Needham, 
Massachusetts. The organization 
was born again at the University 
during 
the 
second 
semester 

of Lassman’s sophomore year, 
after joining Pi Sigma Epsilon, a 

consulting fraternity on campus.

Since its introduction at the 

University, pink seats have been 
installed 
at 
performances 
for 

MUSKET, the Friars, 58 Greene, 
and an impromptu comedy show 
organized by a group of friends. 
For this upcoming winter semester, 
the organization has established 
a partnership with Big Ticket 
Productions.

Students 
in 
entertainment 

organizations on campus have 
been eager and excited to support 
Lassman’s Pink Seat Project at 
their own performances. “It’s 
students talking with students,” 
said Carly Yashinsky, LSA Senior 
and consulting director for the 
Pink Seat Project.

“The person who recorded the 

PSE promotional video … she was 
in her own a capella group and she 
had a performance that Friday.” So 
Lassman asked, “‘Can I get a pink 
seat there?’”

“One of my friends is in a stand 

up comedy club … so I put one pink 
seat there.”

The 
Pink 
Seat’s 
reach 

throughout Lassman’s time as a 
University student has extended 
beyond this campus. “I studied 
abroad in Australia,” Lassman 
said. “One day … I walked past 
the theatre department.” He went 
inside, looked for a manager and 
was eventually directed to another 
building where he met a student 
in charge of ticket sales. Lassman 
gave his pitch, the student was on 
board and that weekend, three 
pink seats were installed at a 
student performance of “Romeo 
and Juliet” at the University of 
New South Wales.

The 
Pink 
Seat 
Project 
is 

expanding in the U.S., too. Students 
at the University of Colorado at 
Boulder and a high school student 
in Miami are seeking to install pink 
seats at performances in their local 
areas.

The Pink Seat’s success has been 

due in large part to the receptivity 
of the arts community with whom 

they create partnerships. Lassman 
began playing the trumpet when 
he was young, and at his quartet 
performances he was exposed to 
people who seemed to “generally 
enjoy being surrounded by people.” 
Lassman he said he knew when 
starting his organization that “a 
community like that would be most 
receptive to an idea like this.”

The arts community is also the 

Pink Seat’s target audience. Equally 
as important as its mission to 
fundraise is its dual purpose to raise 
awareness about the importance of 
these procedures. A cure for breast 
cancer is in the spotlight of the 
breast cancer conversation, and so 
the importance of early detection is 
often overshadowed.

A pink seat in a venue is a 

visual cue. It is an effective tool 
for awareness because it doesn’t 
explain its meaning, it sparks a 
question. Audience members can 
find the answer in their programs, 
and it’s Lassman’s hope that “it 
sparks them to do a little bit more 
digging.”

For some, it can spark more than 

a question or newfound awareness, 
it can spark a reaction and a 
connection. A MUSKET alumnus 
was the occupant of a pink seat at 
the group’s performance of ‘Big 
Fish’ in 2016. 45 years earlier, 
after a dress rehearsal for his 
performance of ‘My Fair Lady’ in 
1971, he went to the hospital with 
some fellow cast members and 
sang a rendition of ‘Wouldn’t it Be 
Loverly’ to his mother. She was sick 
from breast cancer and nodded off 
when they finished the song.

“He can come back and see 

MUSKET 
supporting 
breast 

cancer,” Lassman said. “It brought 
him to tears.” 

A seat is more than a place 

to sit, and it serves more than a 
philanthropic purpose. The Pink 
Seat creates a culture of care that 
relies on, and can strengthen, the 
connectedness of the community 
of those that enjoy arts, theatre, 
music and entertainment.

COMMUNITY PROFILE

A look at Lanthimos and 
the division over his films

How one director’s filmography has created divisiveness in viewers

I’m 
mainly 
writing 
this 

because I can’t figure out if I like 
Yorgos Lanthimos’s films and 
I have a feeling I’m not alone in 
this sentiment. Some think he’s 
pretentious, some think he’s a 

visionary and a genius, some 
think he’s downright crooked 
and disturbed — and some are 
probably in the middle like me.

“Dogtooth” 
(2009), 
“The 

Lobster” (2015) and the newly 
released 
“The 
Killing 
of 
a 

Sacred Deer” all follow a similar, 
authentically and distinguishably 
Lanthimosian aesthetic of a 

bizarre dystopia. “Dogtooth,” 
a film in the director’s native 
Greek, traces a controlling father 
who locks his children on their 
house grounds and brainwashes 
them. “The Lobster” gives its 
characters 45 days to find a mate 
and, if they do not succeed, they 
are turned into the animals of 
their choice — a bleak survival of 

the fittest. And in his latest film, 
“The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” a 
surgeon is forced to choose the 
fate of his children’s lives through 
the psychological mind control 
of the son of a patient who died 
during his operation. It’s the 
ultimate vendetta.

Lanthimos’s directorial vision 

and overall view of the world is 
undeniably twisted and dark. He 
attempts to critique the complex 
themes that we face as humans: 
the conditioning one’s upbringing 
forces on the individual, the 
competition to find a compatible 
partner and procreate and the 
hunt for revenge. In a way, his 
stories trace, thematically, the 
stories of his predecessors of the 
Ancient Greek classics, as they 
all explore the primal nature 
of humans. The title of “The 
Killing of a Sacred Deer” itself 
is even based on the Greek myth 
of Iphigenia who is sacrificed 

by 
her 
father, 
Agamemnon, 

who killed a sacred deer and 
then must therefore murder his 
daughter for retribution from 
the gods. An ode to his roots, 
perhaps, his vision is evidently 
imbued with an influence from 
an iconic historical period when 
the instincts of violence and 
vengeance were esteemed.

Probably 
what 
has 
made 

Lanthimos such a provocative 
director is his reliance on visceral 
elements 
and 
reactions 
that 

many claim to be outrageous 
and disturbing. His movies are 
weird; they don’t quite fit into one 
specific genre and the frequent 
violence he features can at times 
seem arbitrary. He relies on 
disorienting the audience as a 
device to reveal the greater truths 
about his films, like in “The 
Killing of a Sacred Deer” when 
the characters speak in a robotic, 
monotone speech that distances 

them from reality or when, in 
“Dogtooth,” 
the 
brainwashed 

kids are taught misnomers by 
their parents (like the word 
“telephone” to replace the word 
“salt”) to comment on how truth 
and knowledge are subjective 
and 
how 
one’s 
environment 

determines 
everything. 
This 

deliberate 
disorientation 

enters the audience into an 
uncomfortable position which 
can 
be 
overwhelming 
and 

unsettling, which is likely his 
intention.

“The Killing of a Sacred Deer” 

received the best screenplay 
award at Cannes. Though, like all 
of his films, critics and fans alike 
are bound to have polarizing 
views on the film. Some detest his 
work and some thrive off seeing 
what he’s going to release next, 
but despite this divide, his films 
are damn entertaining and worth 
a view.

We will jump off the roof, land on the cardboard boxes and kick flip 
Streaming & ‘The Office’

The week before “High School 

Musical” aired on Disney Channel 
was probably one of the most 
exciting weeks of the summer 
before 7th grade. It’s all any one 
of my middle school friends could 
talk about. My sister and I camped 
out in front of our old-fashioned 
box TV for an hour before with 
snacks so we wouldn’t miss it. 
In fact, the idea of missing it was 
absolutely traumatic.

Now, for the most part, I don’t 

have to wait a week to watch one 
of my favorite programs. I can get 
it instantly by logging into one 
account, 
taking 
approximately 

11 seconds. Netflix. Xfinity on 
Demand. Hulu. You name it. I want 
it, I have it. No wait, no hassle. 
And this ease has shaped the way 
consumers watch and enjoy TV.

“The Office” aired on NBC in 

2004 and has now become one of 
the most watched programs on 
Netflix. I can watch it whenever 
I want. That mindless action of 
turning it on whenever I open my 
Netflix account is the reason I have 
seen every episode more than five 
times. While there are many great, 
new exciting tv shows out there to 
watch, none of them hold onto my 
heart quite like “The Office” does.

“The Office” follows the lives 

of ordinary office workers in 
Scranton, 
Pennsylvania. 
The 

manager of the office, Michael 
Scott (Steven Carell, “Last Flag 
Flying”), is the biggest dope 

you’ve ever met, saying and doing 
unimaginable things, yet making 
me laugh appropriately. Michael’s 
loyal yet conniving number two, 
Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson, 
“Thom Pain”), is a strange pariah 
with a bizarre lifestyle, like living 
as a beet farmer on the side. 
Additionally, the Jim Halpert 
(John Krasinski, “Detroit”) and 
Pam Beesley (Jenna Fischer, “The 
Guest Book”) evolution never fails 
to make me tear up. (Soft, I know).

Steve Carell can successfully 

record cringe worthy moments, 
like having to tell a bunch of high 
schoolers he can’t pay for their 
college when he promised to 
or when he gets up at Jim and 
Pam’s wedding to make a toast 
about 
consensual 
sex. 
These 

moments leave me with pain and 
second-hand embarrassment. I’m 
impressed Carell could get through 
half of those scenes. Michael’s 
character is also noticeably and 
undebatably pathetic. He has no 
family of his own, and his own 
mother shits on him. Yet, his love 
for his employees is heartwarming 
but also kind of sad and creepy.

The dynamic of Jim and 

Dwight’s 
friendship/rivalry 

constantly feeds the witty humor 
of the show. Jim plays ingenious 
tricks on Dwight, like putting his 
stapler in jello or conditioning him 
to ask for a mint when he rings 
a bell. I’ve seen this scene in so 
many of my psychology classes, so 
hey, the show is educational, too. 
Sometimes his schemes are more 
elaborate. For example, he sends 
Dwight faxes from “Dwight’s 
future self” and Dwight believes it. 

Or one time he destroyed Dwight’s 
hotel room and pretended to be 
dead. Jim’s child like personality 
juxtaposed to Dwight’s stern 
seriousness makes the pair an 
irreplaceable duo.

The light, playful humor riddled 

in “The Office” makes it enjoyable 
for any audience, well, as long as 
you like to laugh. My sister and 
I have “The Office” marathons 
whenever 
I 
come 
home 
for 

breaks. It’s filled with awkward 
yet hilarious situations that have 
become the tail-end of jokes 
between my sister and myself. The 
show itself isn’t the reason why I’m 
so attached, but the sentimental 
value it has of reminding me of my 
sister amplifies my love for it.

Jim and Dwight’s frenemy 

relationship isn’t the only famous 
interaction in the show — Jim 
and Pam. Pam is engaged to a 
monster of a boyfriend, yet has her 
best friend, so obviously in love 
with her, watching it all happen. 
Jim pines over Pam, giving her a 
sentimental teapot for Christmas, 
a scene so staple in the show that 
I have seen it been as a gift in real 
life out of mimicry. Jim finally tells 
Pam his feelings, but she rejects 
him which probably made not just 
me, but everyone else watching 
want to give her a roundhouse kick 
to the jaw. It was probably one of 
the most frustrating scenes in the 
show, but thankfully, it all worked 
out for the better.

Jim and Pam fall in love, get

TV NOTEBOOK

How the immediacy of Netflix let’s us tap into TV obsession

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
The persistence & focus 
on negativity in the arts

How the tortured artist aesthetic can be detrimental for young artists

This past week, I viewed a 

presentation of “artist’s books” 
by former Stamps School of 
Art & Design students here 
at the University. An “artist’s 
book” is a piece of art meant to 
resemble and / or be consumed 
as a book. In this case, they were 
supposed to be representative of 
the creative process. One of the 
books was an elaborate drawing 
of a tall mountain and a lake, 
presumably 
representing 
the 

insurmountable challenge and 
inevitable fall of the creative 
process. 
Another 
depicted 

string being attached to a brain, 
which is (what I assume to be) 
a depiction of creative thoughts 
being pulled out of the artist’s 
head.

While some of these books 

were more cheerful than others, 
they all explored the fear and 
anxieties that are part of the 
creative process –– none of 
these artists chose to take 
a positive view. As a casual 
observer of these works, I was 
stunned by the negative feelings 
that the creative process brings 
to these artists and the complex, 
ambiguous ways in which the 
artists tried to convey these 
feelings.

The same could be said 

of many of the compositions 
that 
were 
premiered 
this 

past weekend at the Midwest 
Composers Symposium, an all-
day event on Saturday featuring 
music from composers studying 
at the University of Iowa, the 
University 
of 
Indiana, 
the 

University of Cincinnati and the 
University of Michigan. Most 
of the pieces at this event as 
well were sad and depressing, 
with unnecessary dissonances 
giving everything a melancholy 
feel. In particular, almost all 
the chamber music that was 

premiered during the event 
was atonal almost to a fault — 
the composers were obviously 
working 
extremely 
hard 
to 

sound complicated and modern. 
Unlike many modern Serialist 
composers, these pieces were 
devoid of anything even remotely 
implying consonance. They were 
so complicated that they were 
incomprehensible.

While complex art can be 

interesting and engaging, this 
propensity toward complexity 
among 
students 
can 
stunt 

artistic growth. As Pablo Picasso 
once said, “Learn the rules like 
a pro so you can break them like 

an artist.” Without a complete 
understanding of of the forms 
and stylistic normalities that are 
being broken to make art seem 
complex, these young artists 
lack a basic understanding of 
their art forms.

At 
the 
Midwestern 

Composer’s Forum, for example, 
a quick glance at someone’s 
score showed that they lacked a 
proper understanding of meter 
and beaming — their inability to 
properly beam their eighth notes 
broke through their complex 
polyrhythmic 
facade 
and 

ruined what was an otherwise 
extremely sophisticated-looking 
score. 
Enharmonic 
spellings 

also 
gave 
way 
to 
pseudo-

sophistication with E-sharps and 
B-sharps replacing F-naturals 
and C-naturals all over the page. 
This obsession with complexity 
was also apparent among the 
event attendees: Pieces were 
repeatedly praised for their 
“interesting soundscapes” and 
uses of “extended techniques” 
instead of being praised for their 
emotional landscapes or artistic 
value.

Now this does not mean that 

all art by young composers is 
complex, or that complex art 
is bad. But the tendency for 
complex art among academic 
institutions and young artists 
can 
be 
bad, 
particularly 

considering 
the 
multifaceted 

nature of modern art. Classical 
music, in particular, has moved 
in the past thirty years away 
from an avant-garde dominated 
marketplace. Thanks to the 
work 
of 
minimalists, 
post-

minimalists, 
spectralists 
and 

neo-romantics, composers no 
longer need to compose within 
the 
serialist 
or 
post-tonal 

harmonic languages.

While some institutions have 

been able to breach this stylistic 
gap, many seem to resist this 
change. Ironic as it may seem, the 
last frontier for the minimalists 
to confront is where they began: 
Educational 
institutions 
and 

young artists. These institutions 
and the young artists that occupy 
them remain the last steadfast 
defenders 
of 
this 
complex 

aesthetic movement and all 
it stood for. To the detriment 
of their artistic growth, these 
artists remain committed to 
this 
pseudo-sophistication 

and all it stands for. Though 
it is hard to understand and 
hard to consume, complex art 
is compelling, but it is time for 
a new artistic movement to 
replace the old and for a new 
artistic standard to replace the 
complexity that currently reigns.

A talk with Chris Bernardi 
 

on Pixar’s upcoming ‘Coco’

Bernardi discussed his new project & work as an animator

On Wednesday night, Nov. 

15, Pixar set supervisor, Chris 
Bernardi (“Inside Out”) spoke 
to a nearly full house of students 
interested in animation and 
film. 
In 
his 
presentation, 

Bernardi explained his role as set 
supervisor on his latest project, 
Pixar’s “Coco” (in theaters Nov. 
22) and debuted footage from 
animation tests and preliminary 
drawings.

“Coco” follows the young 

Miguel on the Mexican holiday 
of Día de los Muertos (The 
Day of the Dead). Miguel is a 
passionate musician and looks 
to his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz 
for inspiration, but his family 
has banned music from their 
lives since a tragic event from 
their past. “Coco” is about 
family and heritage and chasing 
your dreams. Yet, “Coco” is not 
your typical Pixar fairytale, it 
combines a rich cultural history 
and with deftness and creativity, 
constructs two worlds of epic 
proportions.

As set supervisor, Bernardi’s 

team was in charge of creating 
the universe of “Coco.” Every 
cobblestone, 
every 
building, 

every 
tree 
was 
sketched, 

modeled 
and 
animated 
by 

Bernardi’s team. The film started 
as a nugget of idea by director 
Lee Unkrich (“Toy Story 3”) in 

2011 as a fascination with the 
Mexican holiday of Día de los 
Muertos, and after multiple 
trips 
to 
Mexico, 
extensive 

research, full-time consultants 
and years of work “Coco” was 
born. 
Bernardi 
emphasized 

the importance of research in 
the film, from the food to the 
movement of the skeletons to the 
detailed ofrendas (altars built for 
dead relatives).

Bernardi said he did not know 

much about the holiday before 
the film, “We have no similar 
holiday here in America.”

Since 
immersing 
himself 

in the culture and the holiday 
he emphasized the beauty of 
“the idea of remembering your 
ancestors.” 

“At the end of the film there is 

an ofrenda and my grandparents 
are up there,” he said. Along 
with 
his 
grandparents 
are 

photographs 
of 
other 
lost 

relatives.

“We tried to do it with a light 

touch,” Bernardi added, “it is 
not a sad thing, it’s the idea that 
people come back to us. We 
remember the things that they 
loved. The idea of spending some 
time to think about them is the 
wonderful sentiment.”

Bernardi highlighted some of 

the challenges his team faced like 
the scale of the double universe in 
the film and the loose movement 
of 
the 
skeleton’s 
vertebrae. 

Additionally, most of the film 
takes place at night, which meant 

the animators needed to provide 
artificial light for every scene at 
night. Also, the team is getting 
used to new rendering program 
with 
pathfinding 
technology 

that the company acquired for 
“Finding Dory.”

When asked about his journey 

to a career in animation he 
explained, “when I started there 
wasn’t even a field, I took a long 
path to Pixar, it takes a while.”

He got interested in electronic 

music 
in 
college 
and 
from 

there he discovered animation. 
Bernardi said the leap from 
music to animation was not as 
big a jump as one might think. He 
explained that music is texture 
for the ears while animation is 
texture for the eyes. He started 
his animation adventure in 2000 
as shading technical director for 
“Finding Nemo.” Since “Nemo,” 
Bernardi has worked on such 
Academy Award-winning films 
as “WALL-E,” “Toy Story 3” and 
“Inside Out.”

Bernardi had some advice 

for all the young animators out 
there: “Work hard.”

“I did a lot of awful animation,” 

he added without shame. “They 
started off bad and I got better 
and better, keep hammering at 
it.”

It took Bernardi ten years and 

a ton of hard work to end up in 
animation

“I wish there was a magic 

bullet but sometimes it’s just 
hard work,” he said.

Copy that: What’s in a name?

statement

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | NOVEMBER 22, 2017

A

mong the unending items we fact-
check, 
spell-check, 
grammar-

check and style-check at the 
mighty copy desk are the names of 

University of Michigan officials, guest speakers, 
Ann Arbor residents and students. Names are 
easy. It takes a simple Google, LinkedIn or 
MCommunity search to make sure we publish 
people’s names correctly. The Daily’s coverage 
at its core is about the people who fill this 
campus, city and state through their actions, 
opinions and — more explicitly — their quotes. 
My job is to check such names.

But every so often, typos and mix-ups 

compromise the correct identification of our 
subjects.

When you introduce yourself, you start 

by saying your name. Names last longer and 
reflect more of your identity than titles do.

One of my first middle school English 

assignments was to learn the origin stories of 
my name. That night I dove into the deeper 
meanings behind my names using Google and 
the fount of wisdom that is my mom.

My given middle name is Madeline, a hopeful 

moniker bestowed upon me by my mother 
who wanted to give me an out and an option 
for an easier life with an English name. Yes, I 
was named after Ludwig Bemelmans’s small, 
rambunctious redhead Parisian schoolgirl 
who needed an appendectomy. And yes, I own 
several hardcover volumes of the books.

After an evening of light research and 

questioning, I discovered that “So Jung” 
roughly 
means 
“foundation 
light,” 
and 

“Madeline” means “tall tower.” As a cheeky 
sixth-grader, I thought it ingenious to combine 
both meanings into one: lighthouse. Since 
completing that homework assignment, I have 
loved my name. Secretly, I hope it’s a self-

fulfilling prophesy.

However, I firmly believe that living and 

trying to work with a Korean name in this 
diverse American society should not be as 
bothersome as it is. Most second-generation 
children 
of 
Asian 
immigrants 
have 
an 

American first name followed by an Asian 
middle name. Mine reverses the norm.

S-o space capital-J-u-n-g. Two words with 

no dash. I find it eternally frustrating that my 
driver’s license, voting record and Scantron test 
bubbles cannot reflect this fact.

I 
have 
tried 
embracing 
“Madeline.” 

During sophomore year of high school, I 
was sick of teachers, substitutes and coaches 
mispronouncing my name so I introduced 
myself as “Maddie.” The experiment only 
lasted one year.

My mom and I discuss the tradeoffs of 

authenticity, 
convenience, 
identity 
and 

assimilation nearly every time I come home 
from school. But I am stubborn. Could it 
be true that hiring managers or internship 
coordinators have passed me over because 
my résumé seems foreign? I naively pray that 
racism is just a conspiracy.

When strangers, friends or professionals 

decide that “So” or “Kim” suffice for their ease, 
I try to correct them politely, but internally I 
question if they respect me.

Since coming to college, simplicity and 

endearment 
have 
chipped 
away 
at 
my 

stubbornness. When I order food, I use my 
initials “SJ” or “SJK,” and many peers across 
campus affectionately shorten my two-syllable 
name to “Soj.”

To everyone who interacts with other 

people — so, everyone — please take 10 seconds 
to make sure you spell someone’s name right. I 
know they will appreciate it.

Empath in the wild: Graduating

R

ecently, a panicky feeling has been 
lingering in the back of my mind. 
I’m entering the last semester of 
my undergraduate education, and I 

don’t know what I want to do when that’s over. 
I, at the very least, know what city I want to be 
in, but I don’t have housing secured and I don’t 
have a job secured. I’ve 
become 
disenchanted 

with my major, English — 
that’s to say, I’ve become 
disenchanted 
with 

literary criticism — and 
I don’t know if I want to 
“be a writer” and what 
that might look like if I 
did.

I’m working through big 

questions like: What does 
it mean to be an artist? 
What does that look like 
for me, outside of school? 
How can I balance my 
own creative endeavors 
with engaging with my 
community? 
How 
will 

I sustain myself? Do I 
want to make a living off 
my writing, or do I want 
writing to be something 
I do outside of work? 
What will I do if I don’t 
write? What is my social 
responsibility 
in 
this 

political climate? These 
questions roll into one 
another and if I spend too 
long thinking about any 
one question, specifically, 
I 
drive 
myself 
crazy 

because I come up with 
so many more questions.

So, last weekend I was 

celebrating my 22nd birthday: I went out to a 
nice dinner on Friday and had friends over to 
celebrate later that night. On Saturday, it was 
really sunny and my boyfriend and I went out 
to brunch, then took a long walk through the 
park and made enchiladas for dinner. It was 
a fantastic weekend — I was surrounded by 
delicious food, people I love and a healthy dose 
of sunshine before the winter hit.

But later that night, my friend and I were 

hanging out and I just sort of burst into tears. 
All the questions I’ve been thinking about 
all semester poured out of me in a general 
frustration and panic about what I was going to 
do and whether anything I did mattered in the 
grand scheme of things, after I graduated from 
college.

I was expecting, from my friend sitting on the 

other end of the couch from me, some assurance 

that I would figure it out, and that I was a really 
determined person who could do whatever I 
wanted to. I wanted my friend to be there with 
me, wallowing in this frustration about not 
liking my major and not knowing what was the 
best thing to do after I graduate — I wanted to 
hear from someone else how hard it is to go out 

into the world.

But this is not the feedback I received. At 

first, I wondered why I wasn’t hearing more 
affirmation. It was only after some of my tears 
dried, after I released almost all my frustrations, 
that my friend started speaking.

Basically, what he told me is that I would be 

fine and I needed to stop wallowing. Barring 
anything extreme happening, I’m going to 
graduate from the University of Michigan with 
a degree, lots of friends and a strong support 
system in my family that will support me if I 
need help. I’m white, and I’m a native English 
speaker. Because of the kind of country we live 
in, all of these things mean, collectively, that 
I’m going to be fine. Sure, maybe I won’t have 
the most fulfilling job ever right out of college. 
Sure, I may feel a little lost for a while. But in the 
grand scheme of things, life is likely going to be 

more than OK for me.

I also received a healthy reminder that, in 

comparison to so many others who live in the 
United States — people who want to go to college 
but haven’t had the opportunity, people who 
immigrated here from another, non-English-
speaking country, people of color and people 

with disabilities — I’m going to 
be fine. As an upper-middle-class 
white woman with lots of friends 
and family close by, I have a lot 
going for me.

My friend also reminded me that 

— although this point is smaller 
in scale than the ones previously 
mentioned — I was in the middle 
of my birthday weekend. I had so 
much to be thankful for and yet 
these individualistic, and kind 
of self-centered questions, were 
preventing me from inhabiting 
the present moment, which had so 
much to offer.

While I think there’s room 

for my individual frustrations 
about the uncertain nature of 
my life after graduation, it’s 
also 
extremely 
important 
to 

maintain 
perspective. 
Being 

stuck in my head prevented me 
from seeing myself as part of a 
larger population of people in 
this country — and ultimately the 
whole world — who don’t have the 
same kinds of opportunities and 
advantages.

Being in my head, preoccupied 

by these individualistic questions, 
kept me from looking outside 
myself to the extent that I wasn’t 
seeing all the amazing things 
happening around me. If I can’t 
fully appreciate a celebratory 

weekend like my birthday, then how could I go 
about empathizing with others on a real level? 
To a certain extent, I think the environment on 
campus facilitates selfish thinking like this. I 
became so future-oriented and so self-centered 
leading up to that night that I couldn’t look 
outside myself.

Since that weekend, I began seeing myself 

as one part of a much larger whole. Instead of 
dwelling on how uncertain my future is, I’ve 
taken concrete steps to appreciate what I have 
in the present: I’ve been doing yoga almost every 
day and reaching out to friends I haven’t talked 
to in a while, since I’ve been too busy trying to 
force myself to “figure things out.” Moving past 
my frustrations about my uncertain future is 
definitely a process, but I can say I already feel 
much better and much more balanced than I did 
a week and a half ago.

A home, not a house

A look at Ann Arbor’s historic co-ops

by Lara Moehlman, Managing Statement Editor
H

ot air wafts from the oven 
in the kitchen of Linder 
Cooperative House, which 
looks semi-industrial with 

steel gray appliances. A hooded stove and 
two picnic benches tucked under a wood-
en table back into the far right corner of a 
chipping, bright orange wall. My Chemi-
cal Romance’s “Teenagers” has been 
playing at full volume, on loop. It’s almost 
7 p.m. and the Linder House co-chefs pre-
pare dinner for the co-op’s 20 residents. 
Recent alum Shannon Stone takes a pair 
of Speedo goggles dangling from a nail in 
the wall above us and pulls them over her 
eyes before continuing with the onions. 
Her movements are methodical and effi-
cient. She knows where everything is 
because each cabinet, each drawer and 
each refrigerator shelf is clearly labeled 
with masking tape and a black Sharpie: 
utensils, plates, bulk foods, bulk vegetar-
ian foods. She cooks dinner for the same 
20 people three times a week.

For Stone, living in a co-op wasn’t as 

much of a choice as it was a necessity.

“I couldn’t afford to live anywhere 

else,” she said, explaining her $600 
monthly rent couldn’t be matched by any 
housing on or off the University of Michi-
gan’s campus.

To be clear, that $600 covers not only 

her room but also her food and, in some 
cases, even her toiletries. GUFF, short 
for Generally Unrestricted Free Food, is 
a term used throughout the Inter-Coop-
erative Council for communal items. At 
Linder, there is a box of GUFF clothing 
filled with used T-shirts, coats and pants, 
a GUFF pantry and refrigerator stocked 
with both weekly groceries and bulk-
stored meats, nonperishables and frozen 
vegetables. The house’s four bathrooms 
hold crates full of GUFF shampoos, con-
ditioners and soaps. If she doesn’t go out 
to eat for the month, $600 is Shannon’s 
cost of living.

Linder House was officially incor-

porated and bought by the ICC in 1989, 
though the house itself was built in 1894 
and previously housed several other 
communities, including Phi Chi frater-
nity and the Keystone Club — a teen divi-
sion of the Boys & Girls Clubs.

The house is named after Benjamin 

Linder, an engineer from Seattle who 
traveled in 1987 to rural northern Nica-
ragua to build hydroelectric dams for a 
public works organization to bring elec-
tricity to underprivileged communities. 
While working in Nicaragua, he was 
assassinated by an anti-Communist rebel 
group known as the Contras, which at the 
time received significant funding from 
the United States government. A mural 
painted over a bright orange wall in the 
house’s living room shows Linder himself 
working on a dam as rebel forces dressed 
in black litter the jungle around him.

It’s clear Linder’s legacy of social jus-

tice and activism lives on in the house 

today. Flyers display everything from 
LGBT rights activism to support of the 
Black Lives Matter movement. In late 
2016, several Linder residents traveled to 
Standing Rock, N.D., to participate in the 
protest of the construction of the Dakota 
Access Pipeline.

A strong tradition of socialist values 

also permeates Linder.

Once or twice a month, residents 

convene to vote on house policy and 
other matters. Each resident holds one 
vote and, together, they determine the 
month’s food budget, how many vegetar-
ian meals they will eat, when to plan the 
next party and even which newspapers to 
buy subscriptions for. The meetings also 
serve as a time for open communication 
and house conflict resolution. Last year, 
the house voted on designated spaces in 
which members can be nude. The kitchen 
was ruled off limits.

Monthly rent at luxury high rises start 

at $900 and might create the illusion that 
houses and smaller buildings around 
them will experience less demand and 
therefore offer lower rent, but a study 
commissioned by the Washtenaw Coun-
ty Office of Community and Economic 
Development in January 2015 shows 
that’s not true. At an October town hall 
meeting for members of both the Uni-
versity’s Central Student Government 
and Ann Arbor City Council, Teresa Gil-
lotti, the Washtenaw County housing and 
infrastructure manager, said 56 percent 
of tenants in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti 
pay 30 percent or more of their income 
on rent. Because the University guaran-
tees housing only for first-year students, 
many are consequently pushed farther 
and farther from their academic build-
ings in search of affordable housing.

*****
The first Cooperative House in Ann 

Arbor was established by graduate stu-
dents in the University’s Student Social-
ist Club during the Great Depression. 
Filling a single house on East Ann Street 
in Kerrytown, members kept their living 
expenses at $2 per week by jointly buying 
the property and communally sharing 
housework. The house was run by demo-
cratic meetings, in which each member 
had an equal say in house affairs. In the 
following eight decades, the co-op sys-
tem has grown to include 16 houses on 
both Central and North Campuses.

The formal Inter-Cooperative Coun-

cil, which currently maintains the sys-
tem’s 16 houses, was established in 1937 
and was run by a board of directors com-
prised of representatives from each exist-
ing house. In 1951, the system, which was 
previously entirely student-run, voted on 
a referendum to hire a full-time execu-
tive secretary to carry out accounting 
and the supervision of purchasing along 
with carrying out board instructions. 
The current ICC functions as a nonprofit 
and has since grown to a staff office of 
around ten adult professionals. 

Michigan House, a bright blue house 

on North State Street, was purchased by 
the ICC in 1947, and has been a mainstay 
within the system for decades. House 
meeting minutes contain notes of a can-
celed meeting the day President John 
Kennedy was shot. Currently, Michigan 
House is jointly run with Minnie’s coop-
erative House, a bright purple monstros-
ity visible from the window directly to 
its right. Residents of both houses eat 
together (in Michigan House) and attend 
house meetings together as a result. 

According to the Michigan House Pre-

amble and Constitution, Minnie’s was 
once a boarding house run by a woman 
named Minnie Wallace, who ran away 
with a nudist taxi driver. The house was 
purchased by the ICC in 1970 and paint-
ed Dauphine Purple — Minnie’s favorite 
color.

Situated at the angular intersection of 

Hill Street and Washtenaw Avenue across 
from the Rock, Luther House traces its 
history to the radical activism and coun-
terculture that persisted on college cam-
puses from the 1960s through the 1970s. 
The house was home to the “White Pan-
ther Party” — an anti-racist political col-
lective parallel to the Black Panther Party 
— and its founder John Sinclair, who 
would go on to be manager of the rock 

band MC5.

Yet in addi-

tion to its rich 
history, 
Luther 

House at its core 
is a home and 
community 
for 

its current resi-
dents. Any given 
day you’ll find 
residents sitting 
on 
the 
porch, 

and the house is 
famous four its 
annual 
massive 

Halloween party 
featuring a local 
Ann Arbor band. 

LSA

Melissa 

Newman signed 
a lease in Luther 
House 
after 

her other hous-
ing 
plans 
fell 

through 
last-

minute. She was 
familiar 
with 

the co-op sys-
tem because her 
brother lived in 
a co-op at Mich-
igan State University, and she thought it 
might be a fun alternative to independent 
living. Throughout this past semester, 
she’s additionally come to appreciate the 
comforting transition from dorm life the 
ICC offers from dorm life.

“A dorm is a nice transition from living at 

home to sort of living alone, because you don’t 
have to deal with food, you don’t have to deal 
with a lot of budgeting,” Newman said. “So 
from living in the dorms to doing everything 
on your own, I think that’s a really big jump, 
and the co-op is a good in-between.”

Though she admits sometimes fulfilling 

her inflexible chore hours seems inconve-
nient, she concedes the cooperative system is 
most likely more efficient than independent 
living in the long run.

“I do think it probably ends up being 

that you do less work or an equal amount of 
work you would do anyway,” Newman said. 
“Because if you have your own house, you’re 
cleaning the kitchen and making all these 
meals and that’s really time-consuming, 
whereas here all that stuff is done for you. 
And when you do a task it’s just more focused. 
Instead of it being ‘I have to clean the entire 
house,’ it’s ‘I have to clean the kitchen on 
Wednesday.’ ”

Ultimately, Newman praised the system’s 

priority of affordability in the city’s competi-
tive housing market.

“The ICC is really great in that their prior-

ity is keeping rent low and being that option 
for students,” she said.

Today, the organization’s socialist roots 

are visible in its continued student self-gov-
ernment and ownership.

Unlike in his past jobs in nonprofit man-

agement, Nick Coquillard, the general man-
ager of the ICC, is not directly in charge.

“I’m basically a very glorified adviser,” he 

said. “The best part of my gig is that I get to 
work with so many leaders in the houses that 
get to be the leaders who run the co-ops.”

A framed drawing that reads “I love my 

co-op” sits behind his desk.

Coquillard added that the ICC experienc-

es some pressure from newer, more expen-
sive housing options in Ann Arbor each year 
to update the mostly outdated technology, 
appliances and furniture found in each of its 
houses — renovations that the ICC must take 
into consideration rather slowly in an effort 

to curb rising member fees.

“We’re always facing the cost and the 

effort and the time of maintaining our homes 
while staying affordable,” he said. But though 
he said the speed of cooperation inherent in 
a purely democratic system could be slow, he 
said he loves his job.

“It’s amazing — the group of students and 

people that are in charge of this. They real-
ly care and they really want to further the 
cooperative movement. It’s just a really fun 
place to work.”

*****
Back at Linder House, Stone rolls chunks 

of pink, raw turkey meat into sizable balls 
and places them on an oven tray. When the 
meat is cooked, she pulls a rope from an old-
fashioned bell that hangs from the counter. 
Promptly, about 11 or 12 Linder residents fill 
the small kitchen and neatly fill their plates 
before sitting down at the picnic-style bench-
es. The wall behind the table holds shelves 
with small crates with index-card names 
on them — each contains an individual resi-
dent’s “non-GUFF” food items.

She said though joining a co-op was a 

financial necessity for her, over time it’s 
become so much more than that. She now 
considers cooperative living her favorite 
part of college, as it has provided her with a 
greater sense of community. She made her 
best friends living and working in different 
co-ops, and said she can’t imagine her college 
years without the constancy of coming home 
each night for house dinners.

“There’s an emotional significance 

I attach to this house that I don’t think 
many college students can say they have 
about any particular place,” Stone said 
before sitting down to dinner. “It’s more 
than just a house. It’s a home.”

Personal Statement: No more pretzels

“

Why even drink coffee if you’re 
gonna just have decaf?” I could 
probably buy my own coffee 
shop with the number of times 

someone has asked me.

“I like the taste but I don’t want to 

get addicted and then start to need the 
caffeine,” I would reply. Then it’d start 
a discussion about how they don’t taste 
the same. (Sorry, guys, even after having 
flirted with drinking coffee for almost 
half a year, I still taste no difference.)

Besides, I’m really much more of a 

tea person. But all tangents aside, the 
rationale for my seemingly backward 
coffee-drinking habits was simple: Drink 
one cup of cheap, decaf coffee when I 

crave the taste of it (coffee connoisseurs, 
don’t @ me) and that, in turn, would leave 
me satisfied for at least a month or two. 
I thought allowing myself to have a little 
when I was really craving it would be just 
enough to satiate my hankering but not so 
much as to turn me into a regular coffee 
drinker. 

Cue junior-year second semester. I 

was sluggish and tired, and the nausea 
and stomachaches I’d always had, but 
chosen to ignore, were now almost daily 
occurrences and were worse than ever. 
My mom suggested I see a nutritionist. 
After I described my symptoms to her, 
the nutritionist seemed to immediately 
understand what was going on.

“I think you have a candida infection,” 

she told me. “Essentially, there is yeast 
buildup in your bloodstream. So, you need 

to eliminate gluten and sugar from your 
diet. Some low-sugar fruits are OK, but in 
moderation.” (Read: no more than half-
cup of low-sugar fruits per day.)

At this point, I was already intolerant 

to dairy products and, more recently, 
eggs, so this was the icing on top of a 
really burnt, dry cake. So, even though I 
saw it would be a challenging road ahead, 
because I’m one of those people who 
trusts health professionals, I let her send 
me on my way with a recipe book of dairy-
free, egg-free, sugar-free, gluten-free, 
air-free (I’m just kidding) meals to cook.

Fast forward three weeks or so: I’m 

sitting in the newsroom of The Michigan 
Daily, munching on a salad from Au Bon 

Pain. It was the southwest chicken salad 
(hold the tortilla strips). It was the first 
real meal I’d had all day, and the second 
time that week I’d had this salad.

Almost 
immediately 
after 
starting 

the diet, I went back to school. It was 
my first semester as co-editorial page 
editor — a job that consumed at least 20 
hours of every week — and four classes 
that had multiple assignments due every 
week as well as a mountain of reading for 
each lecture. (Thank you, sociology and 
Spanish majors.)

Just like any other busy college 

student, I had no time to spend hours in 
the kitchen preparing alternative meals. 
So, instead, I spent it obsessing, worrying 
about what I was eating. I started eating 
less and less, until I was only having one 
whole meal a day to avoid having to deal 

with the dreaded question “What was I 
going to eat?”

And because my eating habits became 

so messed up, I would snack on whatever 
fit the diet, and in large quantities — bags 
of popcorn, corn tortilla chips — because 
my meals weren’t satisfying enough. Then 
I quickly got sick of those foods, too.

Breakfast used to be my favorite meal 

of the day, but without toast and after 
being told I should “stay away” from 
gluten-free bread — “Who knows what 
preservatives they have in there!” — I had 
lost my favorite meal. I hated thinking 
about food.

This semester, I cracked. I started 

getting hungrier and unhappier. Because 

I hadn’t been allowed to eat so many 
things, I started eating more sugary 
treats and junk food than I’ve ever in my 
life. I started eating way more of the basic 
foods I’d loved but had been told to stay 
away from.

I began to lie awake at night, thinking 

about how bad I’d been at keeping with the 
diet and whether the pack of Starbursts 
I’d had was making my infection worse. 
This, in turn, made my sleep worse and my 
eating habits kept spiraling downward. If 
I was already giving up on this diet, what 
was another gluten-filled sandwich or 
pack of sugary fruit snacks?

One day, though, as I went to The 

Daily’s vending machine and saw I was 
about to take the last Starbursts pack 
(sorry, Michelle), I realized I’d eaten 
more Starbursts that week than I’d had 

in my entire life. I love Starbursts, but I’d 
always had them only once in a while, and 
they were a special treat I looked forward 
to.

But as I sat down with my fifth pack 

of Starbursts that week, I realized the 
only reason it was eating more sugar 
than I normally do was because of the 
unreasonable restrictions of my new diet 
I wasn’t used to. While the nutritionist 
may have been right to tell me I’d been 
having too many family-sized bags of 
pretzels, asking someone to eliminate 
something entirely is a tall order. Some 
may be able to do that fairly easily, but 
everyone is different and, for people like 
me, extreme restriction manifests itself 

as a stressor in an already stressful life. 
I could likely achieve the same goals of 
getting better sleep, warding off infection 
and leading an overall healthier lifestyle 
— if I just practiced limiting these foods 
in moderation. I knew my body best.

Now, I’m still not a coffee drinker. But 

it’s not because I forced myself to cut it out 
completely. I simply let myself indulge in 
a cup now and then, enjoying the flavors 
when I want to. Though I realize it’s not 
always feasible to practice moderation — 
as some people with allergies or severe 
intolerances have to abide by strict diets 
— I implore us us as doctors, nutritionists 
and a society to work moderation into our 
discourse and health care programs to 
recognize that people are different and 
what works for one does not work for 
another.

The picture stays in the kid: Lives I didn’t quite live

by Daniel Hensel, Daily Film Editor

I 

was never much 
of a teenager. It’s 
not as if I wasn’t 
a student; it was 

that I was absent so much 
— 
literally 
away 
from 

Northbrook, 
at 
debate 

tournaments once or twice 
a month, over the weekends 
— that I never felt as if I 
was really a member of my 
community. After all, when 
you spend your weekends 
in San Francisco and Dallas 
and 
Washington, 
D.C., 

Northbrook just seems kind 
of lame.

That’s 
the 
story 
I’ll 

tell myself to explain my 
(perhaps 
purposefully) 

spotty memory of high 
school 
engagements. 
Oh 

sure, I hazily recall the two 
dances I attended, many of 
my high school a cappella 
group’s performances and 
I unfortunately remember 
the 
may 
weekends 

not 
spent 
at 
debate 

tournaments literally, but 
living vicariously through 
refreshing the debate wiki 
pages to see what teams 
were reading in rounds.

Between the travel, the 

social 
absentia 
and, 
to 

put it mildly, the social 
ineptitude, my high school 
years feel barely sketched 
in. There were classes and 
there was debate … and not 
much else. That’s where 
movies have helped.

I wasn’t much of a film-

watcher in high school 
(coincidentally, I discovered 
Netflix streaming roughly 
a half hour after my last 
debate 
round 
ever), 
so 

much of my experience 
with the cinematic high 
school arrived post facto, a 
bit too late for any sort of 
groundbreaking behavioral 
adjustments. But these films 

helped not only fill in the 
gaps of my experience, but 
understand the struggles 
I faced and contextualize 
my high school years in 
the fabric of our collective 
cinematic projections.

That sounds like a load of 

gobbledygook, but hear me 
out. Films, especially those 
over the past ten years or 
so, have by measure been 
pretty kind to teenagers. 
That is, they seem truly 
respectful of their views 
and 
of 
their 
behaviors. 

No one in these films is 
perfect, but no one in life is. 
They have their faults, and 
so do we.

I watched “Superbad” in 

my junior year of college, 
expecting a raunchy romp 
but was delighted to find (on 

top of the aforementioned 
raunchy romp) a delicate 
tale of male friendship and 
separation anxiety. I don’t 
miss high school too much, 
but I miss my friends, I 
miss the evenings we spent 
driving down to Evanston 

or up to Highland Park 
for ice cream or barbeque. 
When the older students in 
choir and debate graduated, 
I 
missed 
them 
too, 

uncertain of what how our 
groups would fare without 
them. At the start of Terry 
Zwigoff’s “Ghost World,” 
Enid and Rebecca note how 
sad it is that they’ll never 
see one of their classmates 
again. It’s not as if they’re 
all friends or anything, but 
the notion that a person 
whom you spend every day 

with over 12 or 13 years will 
just disappear is quite sad.

Last year’s “The Edge of 

Seventeen” and this year’s 
“Lady Bird” tell similar 
stories 
from 
different 

perspectives. “The Edge of 
Seventeen” follows Nadine, 

who ignores the funny and 
nerdy Erwin while she 
crushes on Nick, the sort of 
moody and enigmatic “bad 
boy.” Meanwhile, Nadine 
quarrels with her mother, 
develops a sort of offspring-
like relationship with one 
of her teachers, and drifts 
away from her brother and 
her friend, Krista, after the 
two start dating. “The Edge 
of 
Seventeen” 
contained 

for me many familiar beats 
of high school — especially 
Erwin, 
whom, 
to 
my 

pleasure, I saw as a stand-
in for myself.

“Lady Bird,” which is 

playing in the Michigan 
Theater currently and is 
easily the best movie of 
the year as of yet, also tells 
a story of a high school 
student, 
Christine 
“Lady 

Bird” 
McPherson, 
whose 

relationship with her mother 
is the central focus of the 
film. Lady Bird’s mother 
is still trying to figure 
out parenting, and, in one 
telling scene, seems to avoid 
telling Lady Bird that she 
likes her. In school, Lady 
Bird discovers her love for 
theater and starts to date 
one boy (Danny … huh), then 
she turns to a more popular 
crush, Kyle, and drifts away 
from her friend, Julie.

Nadine and Lady Bird are 

both deeply flawed people. 
We may begin with sympathy 
at the start, but by the end, 
we start to side more with 
their mothers and friends. 
The films are comforting 
because they allow me to 
fill in the gaps of what I’ve 
missed in high school — 
“Lady Bird” especially is 
a wonderful distillation of 
senior year — and they let me 
know that, honestly, I may 
have been a terrible person 
then and, at this point, it may 
be better to just let go.

And yet, both are still 

uplifting and engender some 
perhaps misguided nostalgia 
for my days at Glenbrook 
North. That’s the power 
of movies: to stir emotions 
beyond 
the 
rational, 
to 

supplement our own lives 
with curated stories, often 
with a point, in the hopes 
of imparting some wisdom 
on our forever-malleable 
minds. 
I 
received 
the 

message.

Ann Arbor, like every other quintessential college town, has an 

abundance of coffee shops. From the well-known chains like Starbucks to 

more local varieties, choosing the right coffee shop to study at or catch up with 

friends can be a daunting task. As someone who usually frequents the same 
coffee shop on campus, I wanted to branch out and explore what makes each 
unique. Additionally, I wanted to capture the ambience of each coffee shop and 

explore why students pick one over the other. From Mighty Good Coffee on 
South University and Washtenaw to Lab on East Liberty, every store offers a 
unique take on serving coffee. While students in each had their own likes and 
dislikes about them, LSA sophomore Sharon Szabo at Espresso Royale on State 
Street put it best saying, “Coffee is coffee ... it’s really about where you can find a 

table!”

Furbush different from most players

Noah 
Furbush 
understands 

this rivalry better than most. 
After all, he’s been on both sides. 

A native of Kenton, Ohio, 

the redshirt junior linebacker 
has three family members who 
attended Ohio State. Naturally, a 
young Furbush grew up cheering 
for the Buckeyes.

Then 
the 
dominoes 
began 

falling.

His older brother attended 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan-

Flint to study physical therapy. 
Then Michigan reached out to 
Furbush himself, who received 
its overtures with an open mind. 
Furbush liked the proximity of 
the school — he’s half an hour 
away from his brother, a doctor 
in Milford, and two hours away 
from his family. He liked the 
school itself, too. So he picked 
the Wolverines, and now the 
rivalry has become all the more 
interesting for him.

“It 
was 
kind 
of 
fun 
to 

transition,” Furbush said, “and be 
different than everyone else back 
home.”

But playing for Michigan isn’t 

the only thing that sets him apart 
from everyone else.

Furbush is finishing up a 

degree in aerospace engineering 
this fall. Next year, he’ll begin 
a master’s program in space 
engineering.

If that sounds far out there, 

that’s because it is.

“There’s 
a 

million different 
things 
that 

I 
could 
do,” 

Furbush 
said, 

“and 
to 
be 

honest, I’m kind 
of glad that I’m 
doing this extra 
year 
of 
space 

engineering. (It) 
gives me an extra 
year to figure it 
out.”

What are some of those things? 

To start, Furbush could become 
a pilot. He was introduced to 
flying and pilot training only one 
year ago, and said Tuesday that 
it “really had a huge impact” on 
him. He still carries a childhood 
fantasy of growing up to be a 
fighter pilot, flying in the military 

or even becoming an astronaut.

If flying doesn’t work out, 

Furbush has plenty of other 
options. SpaceX, the aerospace 
company started by Elon Musk 
that 
hopes 
to 
commercialize 

space 
travel 
and 
eventually 

colonize other planets, could be 
a landing spot. NASA, the more 
conventional leader in the field of 

space exploration, 
is another.

Furbush 
is 

open to non-space 
options, 
too. 
He 

spent 
the 
past 

summer in Costa 
Rica applying his 
engineering skills 
to 
sustainable 

farming. He visited 
a 
solar 
farm, 
a 

geothermal plant, 
hydroelectric 

dam and rocket company that 
specializes in building electric-
propulsion engines.

He also spent time with a 

soil scientist who used spectral 
analysis with unmanned aerial 
vehicles to assess agricultural 
resource use — what Furbush 
dubbed ‘remote sensing.’

That’s where his background 

in aerospace engineering came in 
handy.

“What this guy is doing is he’s 

using these UAVs and he uses 
this multi-spectral camera to 
look down at these plots of land,” 
Furbush explained. “And with 
that, he can look at chlorophyll 
content in leaves, he can look at 
water 
dispersion 

along a plot of land. 
… It’s really kind of 
a growing field.”

Furbush 

admitted 
that 

from 
a 
personal 

standpoint, 
he’s 

“very interested” in 
sustainability 
and 

combating climate 
change. Part of that 
stems from his time 
abroad.

“I was really introduced to 

a lot of new things,” he said. 
“I’d always believe that this 
is important, but I had never 
experienced anything like that 
firsthand. We got to go around 
and got to see so many different, 
interesting, cool things.”

Furbush returned from Costa 

Rica with more to shoulder this 
fall. His schedule is heavier than 
it has been during past seasons. 
He sought the assistance of an 
advisor to make sure he was still 
on track to graduate on time.

The classroom isn’t the only 

place Furbush has taken on 
more responsibility, either. He 
has earned more time on the 

field 
as 
the 

third linebacker 
employed 
in 

Michigan’s 3-3-5 
defense, tallying 
26 tackles and 
two tackles for 
loss through 11 
games played.

Furbush, 

though, doesn’t 
think 
any 
of 

this makes him 
special, 
saying 

that he just tries “really hard” at 
everything.

“I think it’s just all about 

mentality,” 
Furbush 
said. 

“I 
wouldn’t 
consider 
myself 

exponentially smarter than the 
next person.”

Of course, most people would 

disagree.

Redshirt junior linebacker Noah Furbush grew up cheering for the Buckeyes as a native of Kenton, Ohio, but he chose to join Michigan partially because his older brother attended the University of Michigan-Flint.

It was kind 
of fun to ... be 
different than 
everyone else 

back home

The redshirt junior linebacker is finishing up a degree in aerospace engineering 

I wouldn’t 

consider myself 
expotentially 
smarter than 

the next person


Chase Winovich doesn’t 

forget things easily. 

He still remembers the 

Ohio State fan who “shot 
the double bird” at him last 
year. He still remembers his 
omission from the Under 
Armour All-America Game. 
He still remembers the scout 
team, the position change 
and every other slight, in 
part, because all of that has 
made him who he is.

Perhaps 
it’s 
those 

recollections that draw his 
teammates to say the redshirt 
junior has a few screws loose, 
that he’s different. Frankly, 
they’re not entirely wrong. 
Winovich himself will admit 
that he’s “just that right 
amount of crazy.”

Ask 
him 
about 
Conor 

McGregor. He’ll say he would 
love to just “be boys with 
him.”

Ask him about how he 

approaches each day. He’ll 
compare himself to a lion 
needing to be faster than 
gazelles.

Ask 
him 
about 
this 

team’s 
identity. 
He’ll 

reference a Steven Spielberg 
documentary 
to 
make 

the point that Michigan, 
regardless of its youth, can 
defy expectations.

But the path he has taken 

to become the Wolverines’ 
starting 
defensive 
end 

required craziness, obsession 
or whatever you want to call 
it.

So let’s do away with the 

illusion of normalcy. Chase 
Winovich is different.

He is crazy.

***

It surfaced at his 10th 

birthday party.

Winovich was hosting a 

double-elimination checkers 
tournament at his house, 
eventually matching up with 

his friend, David Stover.

There were no seeds, but 

if there were, Stover would 
have 
been 
up 
there. 
As 

Winovich says, Stover was 
a bright kid 
that was in 
the 
gifted 

program. 
Winovich 
lost 
and 

promptly 
ran upstairs, 
crying, 
pleading for 
his 
dad 
to 

beat 
David 

in the next 
round. Even 
then, losing 
was a shock 
to his pride.

“I was like, ‘You have to 

beat him so that I can play him 
again in the loser’s bracket,’ 
” Winovich recalls. “In my 
head I’m thinking like, ‘How 
can I win?’ And I thought to 
myself, ‘Beating him twice in 

the championship will be a 
tough task, but I know if I can 
get him in the loser’s bracket, 
where I’m at, I can beat him 
again.’ ”

Sure enough, 

that’s 
exactly 

what happened.

Winovich’s 

dad 
beat 

David. 
Then 

Winovich beat 
him 
himself, 

jumpstarting 
a 
run 
to 
a 

10-year-old 
checkers 
tournament 
title.

Winovich 

admits 
that, 

for Stover, the 

experience 
was 
“probably 

just irrelevant.”

But not for Winovich. He 

calls his competitiveness a 
curse and a gift. Asked for 
an example of such away 
from a football stadium, the 

checkers tournament is the 
first thing that comes to 
mind.

“When you hate to lose and 

you want to win that much, it 
creates anxiety in a sense,” 
Winovich says. “It’s like, you 
want it more than anything 
you’ve ever wanted in every 
situation.”

And there’s a lot that 

Winovich wanted.

***

For what it’s worth, Bill 

Cherpak doesn’t think Chase 
Winovich is crazy.

But Cherpak knows his 

do-it-all 
standout 
doesn’t 

care what anybody thinks of 
him. As Winovich’s former 
coach at Thomas Jefferson 
High School in Jefferson 
Hills, Pa., he saw that every 
day.

As 
a 
junior, 
Winovich 

would 
ruin 
offensive 

practices on the scout team 
defense. As a senior, he asked 
to be on the kickoff team.

He saw it off the field too 

— in a dance contest of all 
places.

In December of his senior 

year, Winovich participated 
in Thomas Jefferson’s fifth 
annual “Dancing With the 
Athletes” — an event in which 
all proceeds were donated to 
the Four Diamonds Fund, 
a nonprofit that supports 
families with children who 
have cancer.

As 
Cherpak 
recalls, 

Winovich was “busting his 
ass” with his partner to 
prepare for a disco rendition 
“like Saturday Night Fever.”

The work paid off. To 

Cherpak’s best recollection, 
Winovich won.

It was just a few months 

prior that he won a different 
type of battle, too.

Winovich’s older brother 

played quarterback, and he 
idolized him. So, as Cherpak 
recalls, 
Winovich 
always 

wanted a shot to line up 
under center.

“And we’re like, ‘Listen, 

you’re not a quarterback. 
You’re actually horrible at 
it.’ ”

Qualified or not, Winovich 

was eventually granted his 
wish, despite mechanics that 
left something to be desired.

“He 
thought 
he 
could 

throw,” Cherpak said. “He 
really wasn’t that good. He 
thought he could. It would 
seriously 
be 
the 
ugliest 

form.”

When all was said and 

done, 
though, 
Winovich’s 

mechanics 
didn’t 
really 

matter. Entering his senior 
year at Thomas Jefferson, 
Winovich split snaps under 
center. Then he won the 
starting job.

There 
were 
games 
in 

which he’d carry the ball 
25 times, and throw once or 
twice. Form aside, Winovich 
was a leader, and he got the 
job done.

“That was him,” Cherpak 

said. “He would, like, will 
himself to do it even though 
he wasn’t skilled at being a 
quarterback. ... He just made 
plays. He just got it done. 
Whatever he had to do, he 
was finding a way to get it

The madness that made Winovich

KEVIN SANTO

Managing Sports Editor

People call Chase Winovich crazy. They say he has screws loose. And frankly, he doesn’t care.

EVAN AARON/Daily

Redshirt junior defensive end Chase Winovich spent two years trying to carve out his role with the Wolverines, but eventually he found his home as Michigan’s starting defensive end.

When you hate 

to lose and 
want to win 
that much, it 

creates anxiety 

in a sense.


done.”

That 
wouldn’t 
be 
the 

last time Winovich willed 
something into being.

***

When 
Matt 
Thompson 

first met Chase Winovich, 
Nick Volk had a prediction 
for him.

“The day I met Chase,” 

Thompson recalls, “(Volk) 
said that Chase was gonna be 
an All-American one day.”

Winovich came to Ann 

Arbor to play SAM in Brady 
Hoke’s defensive scheme, was 
asked to play tight end upon 
Jim Harbaugh’s arrival, hurt 
his PCL in 
the 
ensuing 

Spring 
Game 
and 

pulled 
his 

hamstring 
during 
the 

first 
week 

of 
camp. 

He 
found 

himself 
as 

the 
sixth 

or 
seventh-

string tight end.

Ask Winovich if he was 

any good at the position, and 
he’ll preface his answer by 
saying that he may be more 
confident in his abilities than 
others. Then he’ll tell you he 
could have been decent.

Ask former scout team 

quarterback Matt Thompson, 
and he’ll say that — despite 
all the time Winovich spent 
studying the concepts and 
catching 
balls 
outside 
of 

practice — they both knew 
tight end wasn’t the right 
position for him.

Thompson was also Chase’s 

former 
roommate, 
so 
he 

knows that Winovich never 
said so out loud. Instead, he 
reverted to the part of him 
that made losing a checkers 
match so unbearable.

“The way Chase’s brain 

is hardwired is that he will 
literally run through a wall 
for anybody,” Thompson said. 
“And I guess I would just try 
to make sure to emphasize to 
him that the position move 
was for the best of the team 

and that it’s a 
phenomenal 
opportunity for 
you to shock 
the 
world, 

because nobody 
had 
high 

expectations 
for him at the 
position. 
That 

type of thing 
excites him.”

Winovich 

didn’t get to shock the world, 
at least not at tight end.

He was reserved to special 

teams and — for the second 
straight year — scout team 
responsibilities.

It was in those practices 

that 
Winovich 
came 

across a safety who didn’t 
take as much pride in the 
scout team as he did. To 
Winovich, winning on the 
scout team meant making 
the offense better “at all 

costs,” especially when the 
offense was sputtering in 
2014. Eventually, the issue 
came to a head. Winovich 
told him that he was never 
going to make it here, 
because he didn’t want 
it bad enough. He wasn’t 
wrong. The safety didn’t 
make it.

There 
were 
other 

instances like that too. A 
punter criticized Winovich 
for missing a tackle in a 
scrimmage. Winovich told 

him to worry about punting.

In 
short, 
people 

took 
exception 
to 
the 

competitiveness he calls a 
gift and a curse.

“They got pissed at me 

everyday,” 
Winovich 
said. 

“I was just going so hard. 
Sometimes I was just being 
a schmuck, like I’d celebrate 
after I got a sack.”

Fifth-year senior center 

Patrick Kugler remembers 
those 
celebrations 
well. 

Winovich 
would 
do 
the 

worm, the Nae Nae or any 
celebration he could conceive 
after 
a 
big 
play 
during 

practice his freshman year.

Michigan went 5-7 that 

year. Brady Hoke eventually 
asked him to stop. The antics 
were dialed back.

As you can gather by now, 

though, there was no turning 
off Winovich’s motor.

That 
motor 
brought 

Winovich to blast music on 
the way to practice with 
Thompson, 
when 
his 

friend wasn’t 
feeling 
up 

to the grind. 
He’d 
tell 

Thompson 
that it was 
his big day, 
that he was 
the 
next 

Tom 
Brady 

— ready to 
climb out of the cellar of the 
depth chart.

And 
eventually, 
that 

motor landed him back in 
the defensive line room after 
Harbaugh’s first season.

“Yeah, I was ecstatic,” 

Winovich said. “It was my 
coming home party. Like 
LeBron James had going 
from Miami to Cleveland, I 
had mine going from tight 
end to defense.”

Added 
Thompson: 
“He 

was just really excited and 
said, ‘I think I was made for 
this position. My name is 
Chase. My name is not Block 
or Catch. I think I was made 

to play on defense.’ ”

And if 2017 has been any 

indication, 
Winovich 
was 

right.

***

Drive four miles east on 

Washtenaw 
Avenue 
from 

Schembechler 
Hall, 
and 

you will arrive at Randazzo 
Dance Studio.

If Winovich truly doesn’t 

care what people think of 
him, taking ballet classes in 
the offseason was a pretty 

good 
way 
to 

show it.

He 
went 

to the studio 
last 
spring, 

while 
still 

taking classes, 
and 
talked 

with 
Sarah 

Randazzo, 
the 
studio’s 

director. 
He 

asked 
for 

recommendations, and went 
through an evaluation.

Soon after, he was paired 

with Audrey Launius for one-
on-one instruction. Once a 
week for about three months, 
Winovich was in the studio. 
He started with basic ballet-
bar work, before moving on 
to pliés, tendus and degages.

Like most things Winovich 

does, he was good at it, and 
good simply wasn’t good 
enough.

“He picked it up very 

quickly, but he also asked the 
right kinds of questions,”

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Chase Winovich, now a starter, has paved his way to a legitimate chance of making it in the NFL, as he is second in the Big Ten in tackles for loss.

EVAN AARON/Daily

Chase Winovich boasts a competitiveness that he calls a blessing and a curse, and his first memory of such is a checkers tournament that he hosted.

I was ecstatic. 

It was my 

coming home 

party.

They got pissed 
at me everyday. 
I was just going 

so hard.

See WINOVICH, Page 6C

 Launius said. “(He asked) a lot 

of questions about the mobility 
of the movement that a beginner 
student wouldn’t even have the 
conception of asking.”

Having taught at the studio for 

the past 10 years, Launius never 
once saw a football player walk 
through its doors. But as she put 
it, teaching Winovich was “a 
treat.”

Though they joked about it, 

there was never a recital in the 
cards for Michigan’s 6-foot-3, 
253-pound defensive lineman.

“He was like, ‘Yeah I could 

get up there, you just show me 
the stuff, we’ll work on it and I 
could get up there,’ ” Launius 
said. “And I think we joked about 
whether or not he’d have to wear 
a tutu, and he’s like, ‘I’m not sure 
about that but we’ll see.’ ”

As Launius explained, the 

ballet lessons allowed Winovich 
to focus on external rotation 
muscles — helping him to quickly 
shift weight, and teaching him 
to control his body when it was 
caught in odd positions.

For all the affinity Winovich 

had for being a quick study, 
though, there was one thing he 
never was good at: musicality.

Launius would tell her pupil 

the steps they were going to do, 
and turn on a piece of music. The 
music, no matter what it was, 
didn’t matter.

“He would do the steps to his 

own rhythm,” Launius said. “He 
would do it really well, but he 
would never do it with the music, 
so it didn’t really matter if there 
was music or not.”

And perhaps there’s no better 

metaphor for this journey than 
just that. Chase Winovich, in 
a ballet studio of all places, 
disregarded the music. He moved 
to his own.

***
During his junior year of 

high 
school, 
Winovich 
was 

approached with a question.

Do you want to play in the 

NFL?

The 
inquiry 
came 
from 

then-Florida 
State 
defensive 

coordinator Sal Sunseri.

Winovich said yes, but isn’t 

shy in now admitting it wasn’t 
even on his radar. He was roughly 
three months removed from 
getting his first college offer. 
He had just switched positions 
during the season, and was still 
“trying to make it” in high school.

It was a self-admitted time of 

uncertainty.

The 
NFL 
was 
never 

Winovich’s 
first 
dream. 
He 

didn’t give much thought to his 
plans after college at all. At least 
in part, that changed when he 
visited Michigan in April and 
stayed with former linebacker 
Jake Ryan. They showed him 
highlights of himself and Ryan 
side by side, and Winovich knew 
Ryan was a good student as well.

As Winovich put it, making 

that sort of impact at the college 
level was “all I wanted to do.”

Now, he’s done that and more.
Winovich has one more year of 

eligibility, but the NFL beckons. 
Harbaugh has equated him to 
J.J. Watt. Hyperboles aside, he is 
second in the Big Ten in tackles 
for loss and fifth in sacks.

And all the hype comes only 

one year after his defensive 
homecoming. 
Last 
season, 

Winovich 
says, 
was 
about 

vindicating 
himself 
and 

embracing the process that got 
him here. He admits that the 
NFL was an afterthought even a 
few months ago. But the reality is 
finally settling in.

“That was kind of the big thing 

last year, but this year I think 
maybe the focus has shifted,” he 
says. “I went to my buddy and 
I said, ‘Man this is crazy. I’m 
actually gonna make it.’ ”

So we’re back to that word. 

Crazy, the term most commonly 
used to describe Chase Winovich.

It’s hard not to almost laugh at 

it.

Because when you ask him 

what his teammates mean when 
they say “Chase is Chase,” even 
he can’t tell you.

When you ask him why he 

dressed as himself for Halloween, 
he’ll say his mom told him the 
worst thing you can be in life is 
someone else.

And when you ask him about 

his current role, he’ll tell you 
a story about shekels from the 
Bible that his friend Macy shared 
with him at Perry’s Burgers in 
Ohio.

Above anything, though, ask 

Chase Winovich if it’s flattering 
that his teammates say he has a 
screw loose. He’ll refer you again 
to McGregor, saying you need to 
be at least slightly crazy toward 
your craft. Then he’ll give you 
another quote, one that seems to 
cut to the core of his being.

“The people that are crazy 

enough to believe they can 
change the world are the ones 
that usually do it,” Winovich 
says.

Maybe not the world. His 

world though? Yeah, he’s already 
done that.

From Page 5
Hill reflects on final career game

Khalid 
Hill 
cried 
during 

Michigan’s final home game last 
year. 

At that point, he didn’t know 

if he’d declare for the NFL Draft 
or return for his final season at 
Michigan.

A presentation — with fittingly 

emotional music — put together 
by photographer David Turnley 
on the big screen didn’t help 
matters, either.

But Hill came back. Now 

the fifth-year senior fullback 
is staring, with 100 percent 
certainty, at what will be his last 
game at Michigan Stadium. His 
mom, brother, high school coach 
and close friend Desmond King 
will all be in attendance. There’s 
a sense of finality that wasn’t 
quite there last year, even when 
all families of fourth and fifth-
year players went through a pre-
game ceremony.

The stakes are higher, too. 

Last year’s senior day game was 
against Indiana. This year’s is 
against the team that everyone 
comes to Ann Arbor to play 
against.

“We need it as a team. We 

need it as a program,” Hill said. 
“We haven’t beaten Ohio State in 
a long time.”

Hill 
has 
already 
noticed 

a 
difference 
in 
the 
team’s 

preparation this week. He called 
Tuesday one of the best practices 
“we’ve had in a long time.”

“We 
were 
flying 
around, 

getting after it,” 
Hill said. “Guys 
are putting forth 
their best effort 
to help us win, so 
we’ve got to go 
out and get this 
win.”

Hill 
has 

had time to be 
retrospective, 
as well. He told 
reporters that he 
believes his decision to return 
for one more year worked out.

“I did what I could to help the 

team,” Hill said. “I put my best 
effort out there on the field, so I 
think I accomplished everything 
I needed to accomplish.”

He 
also 
admitted 
that 

Saturday’s game will be used 
“a lot” to gauge how much this 
young team grew throughout the 
year.

“... Some of these guys are 

playing as freshmen, and they’ve 
got to go through the growing 
pains to get to where they want 
to be,” Hill said. “I think that 
who we are in this last game will 
show that, even though this team 

is young, they still can be a great 
team — and will be a great team 
down the line.”

While there certainly have 

been growing pains, 8-3 is still a 
lot better than where Michigan 

was 
just 
three 

years ago at the 
end 
of 
Brady 

Hoke’s 
tenure. 

Hill said Tuesday 
that 
“nothing 

was 
worse” 

than 
enduring 

that 5-7 season, 
especially 
with 

him injured and 
watching 
from 

the sidelines.

“For us to be doing what we 

are doing, it goes to show that 
we’re trying to turn a program 
around and get back to the 
Michigan way.”

Of course, getting back to the 

Michigan way entails beating 
its most-hated rival. And that’s 
something Hill probably doesn’t 
need to spend a lot of time 
thinking over.

“It’d be something special,” 

Hill 
said. 
“Something 
that 

hasn’t been accomplished in a 
long time. To be a part of that 
team who does it is something 
big. So we’re just putting forth 
as much effort as we can to get 
this win.”

What to Watch For: No. 8 Ohio State

It may only be one game, but 

its implications are anything 
but ordinary. 

And it isn’t just because 

it’s ‘The Game.’ A Big Ten 
championship berth may not be 
on the line, but for the Michigan 
football team (5-3 Big Ten, 8-3 
overall), a date with No. 8 Ohio 
State (7-1, 9-2) could change the 
perception of its 2017 season. 

With a win, the Wolverines 

would finish the regular season 
with a 9-3 record, which would 
be respectable — maybe even 
celebrated 
— 
considering 

their strength of schedule and 
mass of injuries. With a loss, 
Michigan would drop to 8-4 — 
its worst record in three years 
under coach Jim Harbaugh 
— and lose any sign of marked 
progress from the past two 
seasons.

Here’s what to watch for 

when the Wolverines face the 
Buckeyes on Saturday:

How will Michigan respond 

to 
O’Korn 
under 
center 

again?

After 
three 
weeks 
with 

Brandon Peters as the signal 
caller, 
the 
Wolverines 

developed a solid rhythm with 
the 
redshirt 
freshman. 
His 

injury has brought that flow to 
a swift conclusion.

Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh said Monday that 
Peters had been placed in 
concussion protocol, but there 
is no clear indication that he 
will be cleared to suit up. In 
recent weeks, Harbaugh has 
also teased a possible return 
from 
quarterback 
Wilton 

Speight, but the redshirt junior 
is 
still 
practicing 
without 

contact so that prospect seems 
unlikely.

That leaves fifth-year senior 

quarterback 
John 
O’Korn. 

When he makes his return to the 
starting lineup, Michigan will 
have to make adjustments. He 
played for the first time since 
his benching in relief against 
Wisconsin, and the results left 
much to be desired. He finished 
2-for-8 with a measly 19 yards 
in just over a quarter on the 
field.

The Wolverines will need 

much better from him in order 
to stand a chance against Ohio 
State.

Can the Wolverines’ run 

game return to its dominant 
ways?

In recent weeks, Michigan’s 

offense has also been sparked by 
a surge from its running backs 
unit. Between junior Karan 
Higdon, 
sophomore 
Chris 

Evans and fifth-year senior Ty 
Isaac, each rusher has enjoyed 
assertive performances.

First, it was the duo of 

Higdon and Isaac who gained 
over 100 yards apiece against 
Rutgers. Then, it was the pair 
of Evans and Higdon, who both 
almost hit 200 yards against 
Minnesota. And when it was 
up to Evans to do it on his own 
— after injuries to Higdon and 
Isaac — he was still almost 
able to reach 100 yards against 
Maryland.

But against the Badgers — 

the top-ranked rushing defense 

in the nation — the Wolverines 
didn’t fare so well. They gained 
just 58 yards on 37 carries, a 
stark contrast from their earlier 
ways. Ohio State isn’t far off, as 
it is ranked No. 12 in rushing 
defense with an average of 114 
yards allowed per game and 
3.16 yards allowed per play.

With O’Korn still working 

his way back into the rotation, 
Michigan will need to rely on 
its ground game, which means 
the Wolverines can’t afford to 
slip up in that regard again.

Can 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defense stop a trio of talented 
rushers?

Michigan’s 
defense 
is 
no 

stranger 
to 
facing 
talented 

rushers. But while it took 
on the challenges of Penn 
State’s 
Saquon 
Barkley 
and 

Wisconsin’s Jonathan Taylor 
on 
two 
separate 
occasions, 

Michigan was torched by both, 
as Barkley gained 108 yards and 
Taylor gained 132.

Now, the Wolverines will 

have to brace themselves for 
Ohio 
State’s 
three-headed 

monster of running backs J.K. 
Dobbins and Mike Weber and 
quarterback J.T. Barrett all at 
once.

Dobbins 
leads 
the 
pack, 

averaging 99 yards per game and 
scoring six total touchdowns. 
Weber drops off in yards with 
an average of 60.6, but has 
reached the end zone the most 
with 12 scores. Barrett, on 
top of his impressive passing 
abilities, 
averages 
55 
yards 

per game and has scored eight 
rushing touchdowns.

Michigan’s rushing defense, 

which used to be the best unit 
in the country, has fallen back 
to No. 15. The Wolverines will 
have their hands full Saturday.

Can Michigan break the 

streak?

It 
may 
be 
the 
biggest 

game of their season, but the 
Wolverines haven’t been able to 
find success in recent years. In 
the past 13 years, Michigan has 

won ‘The Game’ only once.

The last time the Wolverines 

topped the Buckeyes was in 
2011, when Michigan pulled out 
a 40-34 win in Ann Arbor. None 
of the current Wolverines have 
ever beaten Ohio State.

They 
acknowledged 
that 

shortcoming on Monday, as 
Michigan has a bevy of fifth-
year seniors who have yet to 
secure an elusive win over its 
biggest rivals. One of them, 
senior defensive tackle Maurice 
Hurst, has said that this is 
a “one-game season” for the 
Wolverines because of how 
much they want this victory.

Whether or not they can pull 

it off is an entirely different 
question.

Fifth-year senior defensive tackle Maurice Hurst only has one more chance to beat the Buckeyes on Saturday, as is the case for many of his fellow Wolverines.

The Wolverines have much to gain and the Buckeyes have much to lose

It’s that one week of the year 

that Michigan fans look forward 
to most, even if it’s the one week 
of the last five years they’ve tried 
most to forget. 

The Michigan football team 

(5-3 Big Ten, 8-3 overall) meets 
No. 8 Ohio State (7-1, 9-2) for the 
rivalry’s 114th game this Saturday 
in Ann Arbor.

The Wolverines have a season 

to salvage, and the Buckeyes have 
hopes for the College Football 
Playoff.

The Daily breaks down this 

year’s rivalry matchup.

Michigan pass offense vs. 

Ohio State pass defense

Without 
redshirt 
freshman 

quarterback 
Brandon 
Peters, 

the starting duties fall back on 
fifth-year senior John O’Korn. 
O’Korn’s mid-season stretch of 
games showed little promise, 
though, as he completed just 
50.6 percent of his passes and 
averaged just 140.7 yards through 
his three full starts.

The Wolverines’ receivers — 

with the exception of freshman 
Donovan Peoples-Jones — have 
been all but absent since the 
original 
starting 
quarterback, 

redshirt junior Wilton Speight, 
suffered an injury against Purdue 
in September. Sophomore tight 
end Sean McKeon and redshirt 
sophomore tight end Zach Gentry 
were two of Peters’ favorite 
targets.

The 
Buckeyes’ 
secondary, 

while still a top-20 pass defense, 
might be Ohio State’s one weak 
link. It has allowed an average 
of 177 receiving yards per game. 
Regardless, 
the 
Buckeyes’ 

defensive line has an opportunity 
to tear up the Wolverines’ pass 
protection. The line has tallied 
2.6 sacks per game, and might 
be able to increase that count 
against Michigan.

If the Buckeyes can get through 

to the Wolverines’ quarterback, 
they will surely hinder an already 
out-of-rhythm offense.

Ohio State’s only Big Ten loss 

came when Iowa passed for 226 
yards and five touchdowns, but 
it’s difficult to imagine Michigan 
stringing together a performance 
like that.

Edge: Ohio State

The Wolverines have to hope 

that junior running back Karan 
Higdon and sophomore running 
back Chris Evans can contribute 

more than they did against 
Wisconsin. Last week, the pair 
combined for just 45 yards.

In the three games before, 

Evans 
and 
Higdon 
averaged 

a combined 263 yards and 2.6 
touchdowns per game.

The Wolverines will need that 

level of production, but they 
might not have a shot to reach it. 
Ohio State has the tendency to get 
into high-scoring shootouts, but 
most of its opponents’ points are 
coming in the air.

The Buckeyes have allowed just 

nine rushing touchdowns this 
season, and they managed to hold 
one of the Big Ten’s best running 
backs, 
Penn 
State’s 
Saquon 

Barkley, to just 44 yards when the 
two teams met in October.

Edge: Ohio State
Ohio State pass offense vs. 

Michigan pass defense

This will be the most pivotal 

matchup to watch.

Ohio State quarterback J.T. 

Barrett averages 245 passing 
yards per game. Michigan’s pass 
defense, however, allows just 144.

Michigan 
also 
gets 
an 

extra boost with the return of 
sophomore 
cornerback 
Lavert 

Hill, who suffered a concussion 
two weeks ago against Maryland. 
Hill and sophomore cornerback 

David 
Long 
will 
both 
be 

imperative to shutting down the 
Buckeye’s top receivers — Parris 
Campbell and K.J. Hill.

Urban 
Meyer 
has 
plenty 

more receiving weapons than 
Campbell and Hill, though. Ten 
different Buckeyes have receiving 
touchdowns this year, led by 
receiver Johnnie Dixon, who has 
10 of his own.

Potentially Ohio State’s most 

dangerous offensive weapon will 
actually be tight end Marcus 
Bough. At 6-foot-5, Bough has all 
the characteristics of someone 
that could trouble the Wolverines’ 
pass defense. Michigan struggled 
immensely against Penn State’s 
6-foot-6 tight end Mike Gesicki 
because the Wolverines don’t 
have the physical size to match 
up.

Edge: Ohio State

This 
critical 
matchup 

offers a menu full of young 
talent. Michigan’s two fastest 
linebackers, sophomores Devin 
Bush and Khaleke Hudson, will 
have to chase down Ohio State’s 
top two running backs, freshman 
J.K. Dobbins and sophomore 
Mike Weber.

Dobbins is having a stellar 

freshman 
season 
with 

1,069 rushing yards and six 
touchdowns, and he is also 
followed by Barrett, who has 689 
yards.

Michigan’s 
defensive 
line, 

though, should be up for the 
challenge. 
Fifth-year 
senior 

tackle 
Maurice 
Hurst 
and 

sophomore end Rashan Gary 
are two of the Big Ten’s best 
D-linemen, and they will make it 
difficult for Ohio State to open up 
any gaps inside.

And when Dobbins, Barrett 

and Weber try to run around 
them, Bush and Hudson will 
follow in pursuit.

Edge: Michigan
Special teams
Michigan redshirt freshman 

kicker Quinn Nordin finally hit 
a field goal after missing three 
attempts in the previous four 
games.

He converted a 39-yard field 

goal against the Badgers and 
lit up in excitement. Assuming 
Nordin’s rough patch is over and 
done, he could be crucial again 
if Michigan struggles in the red 
zone.

The 
Wolverines’ 
freshman 

punter 
Brad 
Robbins 
has 

strengths and weaknesses to 
note. While Robbins, an Ohio 
native 
himself, 
averages 
just 

around 40 yards per punt, he 
forces returners to make fair-
catch calls often with how long of 
a hang time he manages.

Neither 
Ohio 
State 
nor 

Michigan has a kick return 
touchdown this year, but the 
Wolverines do have one punt 
return for a score all the way back 
in September.

Both teams haven’t had any 

major contributions from their 
special teams this year.

Edge: Push
Intangibles
Ohio State has a lot on the line. 

The Buckeyes would surely be out 
of the playoff picture with a third 
loss, even though they are already 
moving on to the conference 
championship game.

Michigan, on the other hand, 

doesn’t have much going for it 
outside of pride. Having already 
lost the three biggest games of 
their season, it’s tough to see the 
Wolverines pulling out this last 
one.

Edge: Ohio State
Prediction: Ohio State 24, 

Michigan 7
AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh and the Wolverines have an opportunity to spoil Ohio State’s season Saturday while also salvaging their own to some degree.
