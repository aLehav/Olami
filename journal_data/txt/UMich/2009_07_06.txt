DDAhopes newpay
system will make
parking easier
By TORREY ARMSTRONG
Daily StaffReporter
There is no need to save quar-
ters to fill parking meters any
more.
The Ann. Arbor Downtown
Development Authority has
introduced an initiative to make
parking in Ann Arbor easier and
more efficient with the instal-
lation of 25 new e-park stations
on Main, Liberty, Maynard and
State streets. The new machines
were introduced on June15.
Ann Arbor is now among the
several cities - including Seattle,
Milwaukee, Detroit .and New
York - that use the electronic
payment machine technology.
The e-parks will cover nearly
150 parking spaces. Some of the
mainbenefitstomotoristsinclude
the option to pay with cash, debit
or credit cards and the ability to
add time to a parking space by
phone.
Joe Morehouse, DDA deputy
director, said the machines are
powered entirely by solar pan-
els, which save the equivalent of
3,400 9-volt batteries in energy
per year.
Plans to add extra machines
around the city are on hold

UNEMPLOYMENT

November before Chrysler LLC and
General Motors Corporation filed for
bankruptcy.
The Michigan Department of En-
ergy, Labor and Economic growth
found that unemployment in the Ann
Arbor Metropolitan Statistical Area
rose from 6 percent in May 2008 to
9.1 percent in May 2009, including
a 1.3-percent increase in unemploy-
ment from April to May of this year.
The increased unemployment
rate comes with an unprecedented
amount of job applicants. Although
fewer employers are hiring, numer-
ous Ann Arbor businesses have seen
a significant rise in the number of
students and local residents applying
for jobs since last summer. Yet few
businesses can afford to take on extra
workers.
At U Go's Convenience Store in
the Michigan Union, slower busi-
ness has forced the store to cut back
hours. The store is also no longer
taking applications because it has
already received more applications
than managers can process.
U Go's cashier Christina Wren
said she has given applications to
everyone from students to adults in
their mid-40s, adding that she thinks
the spike in applicants is because of
the current state of the economy and
the lack of available jobs.
"I think people are ready to take
lower-paying jobs because of the
economy being what it is," Wren
said.
Wren added that she thinks that
people are now just "willing to settle
having to make less:'
Vickie Crupper, associate direc-
tor at the Office offinancial Aid, said
that because of the economy, fewer
on-campus and off-campus employ-
ers are posting listings on the Stu-
dent Employment Office's Web site
for both work-study and non-work-
study jobs.

According to Crupper, there were
1,019 fewer jobs posted on the Stu-
dent Employment Office's Web site
during the 2007-2008 school year
than the previous school year. The
Web site posted a greater loss of 1,061
fewer jobs during the 2008-2009
school year.
Crupper wrote in an e-mail re-
ponse that the decrease in job post-
ings can also partially be accounted
for by the increase in Michigan's
minimum wage over the past couple
years.
University employers can also at-
test to the currentcompetitiveness of
the job market.
Beth Theros, an administrative
specialist and building manager at
MedRehab - a University of Michi-
gan Health System rehabilitation
program for patients with brain inju-
ries - received 388 applications only
a few days after posting an opening
for an entry-level position on the
University's job listing website in
March.
Theros said those positions usu-
ally.only get about a quarter as many
applications and that several teach-
ers and adults with master's degrees
applied.
"These are people that were laid
off from other industries - they were
downsized by another company,"she
said. "So they're out there scrambling
to try and get another job."
Sebille-White said in an interview
students still looking for summer
jobs should not be discouraged and
should continue searching for open-
ings and connecting with potential
employers.
"It's planning ahead, starting early
if you can ... being proactive, having
their resume reviewed, building net-
works and connections with people
who are working in the professions
that they're interested in," Sebille-
White said. "If you talk with them
and say, 'I'm really interested in the
work that you ... (do); those are all
tools to help build some of those con-
nections."

pending more funding and posi-
tive reception of the machines from
motorists.
Susan Pollay, executive direc-
tor of the DDA, wrote in an e-mail
interview that the number of sta-
tions could eventually reach 175,
given sufficient funding and sup-
port from motorists.
"The installation of the first 25
gives us a chance to see if commu-
nity members find the equipment
easy to understand and use, which
is helpful to know before commit-
ting to a larger purchase," Pollay
wrote.
A slight raise in the city's hourly
parking rate - effective Wed., July
1, 2009 - will provide some of
the revenue to fund the purchase
and installation of the original 25
machines.
Other funding comes from prof-
its made by existing parking meters
and structures, Pollay said.
"Each year, parking system costs
increase by 3 to 4 percent, but it is
impossible to raise rates until we
reach an increment that can be
divisible by dimes or nickels," Pol-
lay wrote, adding that the revenue
from the e-parks will fund the con-
struction of a new under-
ground parking structure
on South Fifth Avenue.
Morehouse said the
plan to replace the old
single-space meters origi-
nated after the DDA com-
missioned a parking study
in 2007 and found that the
old parking meters were
startingto deteriorate.
"The street meters are
nearly 10 years old and are
starting to show signs of
wear and tear, so they will
eventually need replace-
ment," Pollay wrote. The city
Though DDA members equivale

are optimistic about the machines'
efficiency and ease of use, some
motorists are cautious of the new
system.
"The old ones were more
straightforward," Ann Arbor resi-
dent Lauren Franzblau said.
Larry Brayboy, an Ann Arbor
resident and curbside bookseller
on N. Main Street, was startled
to find an e-park payment station
placed directly in the middle of his
normal selling location on Wednes-
day. He expressed concern over the
machines' susceptibility to weather
damage and vandalism.
"I guess it's nice that you can
add time on the phone and all that,
but they could be a future magnet
for mischief," Brayboy said. "They
could become targets for graffiti.
(The DDA) should consider how
much it would cost to repair dam-
age."
Brayboy added that unforeseen
repair and maintenance costs could
raise hourly rates even more.
Nonetheless, Pollay said the new
parking system is in the best inter-
ests of Ann Arbor motorists.
"Because the DDA is committed
to making downtown parking as
convenient for patrons as possible,
they opted to purchase these pay
stations rather than more meters,"
she wrote.

CVS one step closer to A2

Historic District
Commission OKs
building plan
By JASMINE ZHU
Daily NewsEditor
Last month, the Ann Arbor
Historic District Commission
unanimously approved the design
scheme for a new CVS Pharmacy,
which would move into the 209-211
State Street building and replace
current tenants Sava's State Street
Caf6 and a tattoo parlor.
According to John Baumann,
director of construction at Velmeir
Companies, whichrepresents CVS,
the projected $8-million design
plan for the building will keep the
front fagade and knock out the
back of the building.
In April, Velmeir Companies
submitted its first draft of the
building plan, which called for the
entire building to be demolished.
Soon after, the plan was with-
drawn.
Jill Thacher. Ann Arbor historic

preservation coordinator, said in a
May 8, 2009 Michigan Daily arti-
cle that the HDC rarely approves
projects that demolish an entire
building, except in rare circum-
stances, such as if the building was
a health hazard to the public.
Baumann said the current
development plan would present a
difficult task to construct.
"This is going to be a big under-
taking," Baumann said. "This is
like saving the Alamo."
Ethel Potts, an Ann Arbor resi-
dent and City Planning Commis-
sion member, expressed concerns
about the change in the scale of
the building, which would be
increased three feet in height due
to the new design.
"It could be that the current
grace and scale of the building
could be changed," Potts said,
fearing that the new dimensions
wouldn't match with the scale of
the other buildings on the block.
Potts added that the extra
height would be "too visible" of an
addition from State Street.
HDC Commissioner Patrick
McCauley said his concerns with

the proposed layout include the
building's height increase and the
new storefront thatwould be made
of aluminum.
"My only two concerns are how
raising the parapet wall would
affect the building and what the
new storefront would look like in
relation to the historic fabric of
the building," McCauley said.
Thacher echoed McCauley's
doubts about the proposed store-
front.
"I do have a little bit of concern
about the color of the storefronts,"
Thacher said. "It seems quite
bright and may distract from the
front facade of the historic build-
ing."
Thacher added that "the build-
ing has grown organically over the
century. There are really no char-
acter-defining features left behind
the front elevation."
McCauley agreed, stating that
the location's current condition
contained remnants of architec-
ture from various eras.
"It's a big of a hodge-podge of
things going on," said McCauley,
in reference to the location's cur-

rent condition.
Thacher said she thought CVS's
move to State Street was appro-
priate in keeping with historic
design.
"This is an appropriate use for
retail establishments," Thacher
said. "It does not compete with
or distract from the historic front
fagade because it's as neutral as
possible, just being plain brick."
Baumann said he was confi-
dent in the success of the store's
design.
"We're ready to take on this
responsibility," he said. "We have
a client (CVS) who's willing to put
the money up to do this ... we will
prevail."
Baumann said that if the proj-
ect is approved, it would take six
months to complete and could
begin sometime next year.
Velmeir Companies must next
submit a site plan to be reviewed
by the Ann Arbor planning com-
mission. The planningcommission
will then present its recommenda-
tions to City Council, which will
ultimately decide the fate of pro-
nosed olan.

Keeping the Promnise
State House should reject bill to cut merit-based scholarship
Why call something a promise if you have no problem break-
ing it? As Michigan struggles with an estimated $1.7-billion
budget deficit for the next fiscal year, the state is looking at
eliminating the Michigan Promise Scholarship. While some tough cuts
will need to be made to balance the budget, scholarship aid is too impor-
tant to eliminate. With the state's poor economic situation compound-
ed by ever-increasing college tuition rates, students need state-funded
scholarships more than ever. The state shouldn't break the promise it
made to students - and state residents - to help pay for their futures.

I always feel a bit silly when
people refer to me as a "Michi-
gander." The word sounds like
it should refer to some sort of
long-necked domestic bird. But I
was never ashamed to be a per-
son from Michigan until I read
an article in The Michigan Daily
about a recent Greenpeace report
(Michigan's CO2 emissions higher
than those in entire countries,
06/01/2009). The report, based
on a long-term study conducted
by the World Resources Insti-
tute, found that Michigan emits
more carbon dioxide than 167 of
the 184 countries studied. This
deplorable situation is unaccept-
able, and it demands strong and
swift action.
How can it be that Michigan
emits more C02 than Sweden,
Austria and Greece combined?
A big part of the problem lies in
Michigan's power infrastructure:
80percentofthestate'selectricity
comes from inefficient, outdated .
and dirty coal plants. But accord-
ing to Greenpeace, electric power
accounts for only 40 percent of
the state's massive carbon emis-
sions. Another 30 percent comes
from transportation andnthe fact
that so many people in Michigan
drive gas-guzzlers produced by
the Big Three automakers. And it.
certainly doesn't help that politi-
cians - most notablyAnn Arbor's
representative in U.S. Congress,
John Dingell (D-Dearborn) -
have worked very hard to prevent
much-needed progress toward
improving emissions standards
on these vehicles.
What's especially offensive
about Michigan'sinactiont-and
the entire country's - is this: If
the trend toward global warm-
ing isn't stymied, it will have dire
ramifications for the people who
contributed least to the problem
and had no say in policies that
led to it. Certainly, industrialized
nations willface- and are already
facing - serious problems as a
result of global climate change.
But the people who will suffer
the most are the world's disad-
vantaged: future flood victims
in developing nations, Africans
who won't have enough water
to drink, poor farmers strug-
gling to support their families,
traditional societies that rely on
threatened ecosystems for their

livelihoods - and the list goes on.
Americans may be able to survive
on a warmer planet, but there are
plenty of people in other parts of
the world who won't.
Of course, those in the third
world won't be the only ones get-
ting the worst out of the deal.
Young college students ought to
be fuming about excessive' fossil
fuel usage, too. After all, young
people are the ones who will bear
the brunt of the consequences
of today's carbon emissions. A
fifty-something business execu-
tive who drives a 4x4 Hummer,
ignorantly denying that global
warming is a problem and con-
suming resources like there's no
tomorrow, will probably have one
foot (or both) in the grave before
the worst consequences of those
actions are fully realized. But
that's not so for most students.
Right now, the U.S. is a bit like
a car driving recklessly at 100
mph while a group of unwilling
passengers sit in the back. If the
driver - the policy-makers, busi-
ness executives and others who
brought the U.S. to the present
situation - crashes the car, those
in the back seat will also have to
pay the consequences.
The injustice and the threat
posed by global climate change
demand action at many differ-
ent levels. At the state level, coal
plants must be replaced with effi-
cient, sustainable sources, and
Michigan's legislature should act
quickly to honor the commitment
made by Governor Jennifer Gra-
nholm in her most recent State of
the State address: a commitment
to reduce power plant fossil fuel
use by 45 percent by 2020. At the
national level, Democrats should
stand by their words and pass
legislation to limit carbon emis-
sions and push green technology
forward with additional govern-
ment investment, higher subsi-
dies and an ambitious timetable
for shifting to renewable-energy
infrastructure. And students like
us can help in some very simple
ways: educating ourselves (and
others), writing our legislators,
conserving energy and being con-
scious of how our actions affect
others and our environment.

THUMBS DOWN
A not-so fun-filled ride on
a crashing monorail at Wall
Disney World.

Michigan's House of Repre-
sentatives is now considering a
bill to eliminate the $140-million,
merit-based Michigan Promise
Scholarship. The bill, which the
Senate has already passed, could
cut the scholarship to help com-
pensate for the state's massive
budget deficit. The scholarship
was signed into law by Gov. Jen-
nifer Granholm in-December of
2006 to encourage Michigan resi-
dents to attend college by giving
financial assistance to those who
pass the standardized Michigan
Merit Exam or successfully com-
plete two years of post-secondary
education. More than 96,000 stu-
dents receive up to $4,000 per
person from the scholarship.
Most importantly, retracting
the Michigan Promise Scholar-
ship would hurt students who
depend on this money. For those
who performed well on the
MME, the scholarship pays out
the money in increments during
the first two years of post-sec-
ondary education. That means

that students attending college
this fall were already calculat-
ing the scholarship into their
budgets. Students are finding
it difficult to fund their college
education, evenwithout losing
promised scholarships. Revok-
ing this scholarship money
would make college a less real-
istic possibility for many.
Michigan needs to make col-
lege more accessible for its
residents, not less. After all, a
well-educated workforce is the
best way to rescue the state's
economy. Michigan's current
economic failures are partly a
result of the state's dependence
on the automotive industry.
The state needs to utilize every
method it can to attract more
businesses to the state, and the
best way to do that is to diversify
the state's economy. If the state
invests in higher education,
the number of college gradu-
ates in Michigan will rise, mak-
ing the state more appealing to
the diverse group of businesses

based in science and technology
that the state needs. Thesekinds
of science- and knowledge-
based businesses could help turn
around the state's economy.
But the Michigan Promise
Scholarship is more than just a
helping hand. It was a promise
to support higher education. If
the state were to eliminate the
scholarship, it would be showing
a serious lack of commitment to
higher education during a time
when education is needed more
than ever. It would also call into
question the ability of the state
government to keep its word on
important issues like education.
The bill to eliminate the Michi-
gan Promise Scholarship might
save the state money in the short
term, but improving Michi-
gap's economy for the long haul
depends upon the creation of
more jobs that require a college
education. The Michigan legisla-
ture shouldn't break its promise.
The state's students - and its own
future - depend on it.

E-MAIL ELAINE AT EMORT@UMICH.EDU

It's appropriate that in the same
week our country celebrates the
anniversary of its independence,
there are several shining examples
of corrupt tyrants being expelled
from power all over the world.
Oneoftheseexamplesisremark-
ably close to home. Just one week
ago, Detroit City Council member
Monica Conyers resigned from
office and now faces a five-year jail
sentence for allegedly accepting
bribes in exchange for her vote.
Conyers's resignation comes just
a few months after Detroit Mayor
Kwame Kilpatrick plead guilty to
felonies and resigned from office.
The city of Detroit has suf-
fered for years under the regimes
of wickedly corrupt officials like
Conyers and Kilpatrick. But the
fact that these powerful politi-
cians were finally overthrown is a
testamenttotheenduringstrength
of the people of Detroit, as well as
the strength of the state's courts,
prosecutors and media.
And yet, Detroit's revolutionary
achievement is not the only one in
the news this week. On June 28, a
day before Conyers resigned from
office, the nation of Honduras
exiled its president, Manuel Zela-
ya, in what has been labeled as a
coup d'etat by the international
community.
A coup isn't usually thought of as
a good thing, Indeed, Latin America
has seen its fair share of right-wing
coups that replace one tyrant with
someone worse. But what happened
in Honduras on June 28 wasn't a
coup. Zelaya violated the Honduran
constitution by pushing for a ballot
referendum that called for the con-
stitution to be rewritten. His reason
for this referendum-is obvious -
Honduras's eonstitution prohibits
any president from servingmultiple
terms. In fact, it goes as far as to
prohibit the constitution from ever
being changed to allow a president
to serve a subsequent term.
As Octavio Sanchez, Hondu-
ras's former minister of culture,
explained in a July 2 article in The
Christian Science Monitor, the con-
stitution clearly states that "Who-
ever violates this law or proposes
its reform, as well as those that sup-
port such violation directly or indi-
rectly, will immediately cease in
their functions and will be unable
to hold any office for a period of 10
years" (A 'coup' in Honduras? Non-
sense., 07/02/2009). This means
that the supposed coup d'etat,
technically speaking - didn't take
place. According to Sanchez, "sol-
diers arrested a Honduran citizen
who, the day before, through his
own actions had stripped himself of

the presidency."
This view of Zelaya's actions
is widely agreed upon within the
Honduran government. As Alva-
ro Vargas Llosa, director for the
Center on Global Prosperity at the
Independent Institute, observed
in a July 1 article in The Wash-
ington Post, "Every legal body in
Honduras - the electoral tribu-
nal, the Supreme Court, the attor-
ney general, the human rights
ombudsman - declared the refer-
endum unconstitutional" (Hondu-
ras coup is President Zelaya's fault,
07/01/2009). Zelaya had defied
the Supreme Court by order-
ing the military to prepare for an
unconstitutional referendum. The
head of the military refused to
comply with Zelaya's orders, was
fired, and then reinstated by the
Supreme Court. Zelaya's abuse of
power was flagrant, maniacal and
unconstitutional.
And yet the world has reacted to
Zelaya's overthrow with universal
condemnation. President Barack
Obama said, "we believe that the
coup was not legal and that Presi-
dent Zelaya remains the demo-
cratically elected president there."
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez
- who got rid of his country's term
limits via referendum last year -
has all but declared war on the new
president, Robert Micheletti.
The world needs to wake up to
the reality of the situation in Hon-
duras. Zelaya has no more right to
remain in power than Conyers. In a
June 27 editorial, The Detroit News
wrote that Conyers's corruption
"violates the public trust, breaks
her fiduciary duty to taxpayers and
is overwhelming grounds for her
removal from office" (Monica Cony-
ers should resign seat, 06/27/2009).
The same thing could have been
written about Zelaya. Just as the
workings of the legal system of
Michigan and Detroit eventually
defeated Conyers, so too has Hon-
duras's legal system triumphed
over Zelaya's attempt to grab more
power for himself. It should be cel-
ebrated - not condemned - that
Honduras, whose democratic tradi-
tion only extends back a quarter of a
century, can expel a corrupt tyrant
just as easily as the United States,
where democracy has largely flour-
ished for two hundred years.
Thomas Jefferson famously
said, "the tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time with
the blood of patriots and tyrants."
At least this Fourth of July week,
only the tyrants are hurting.
Robert Soave is the
summer managing editor.

Making a joke ofpoliti'cs

Al Franken is a funny guy.
He is also intelligent and
seems to understand the
needs of his
constituents.
And Franken
seems earnest
in his desire to
be a U.S. Sena-
tor. But despite
all this, he
should not have ED
run for the MCPHEE
position in the
first place.
Celebrity status like Franken's
clearly has an impact on an elec-
tion because it shrouds what's
most important - the issues. It
gives stars an unfair advantage
compared to other politicians
who don't have the same exposure
to the public eye. The star power
of celebrities is nearly impos-
sible to beat, especially when the
star is in public favor. Celebrities
need to stay out of political office
so that America can elect the best
people to serve in office - not the
most famous.
Franken is merely the latest in a
line of celebrities who have become
major politicians - a group that
includes Ronald Reagan, Sonny
Bono, Jesse Ventura, Jack Kemp
and Arnold Schwarzenegger. And
Franken is following in the foot-
steps of a set of civil servants who
have produced uninspired results.
This is not to nay Franken has
no shot at becoming a good - or
even great - senator. He's an
intelligent man. He graduated
cum laude from Harvard in 1973
with a degree in political science.
But talking and writing about pol-
itics is very different from holding
political office, and only time will
tell if he can be successful. And
he's goingto have to break a strong
trend of mediocrity that his celeb-

rity predecessors have created.
Unfortunately, the failures
of elected celebrities have yet
to turn off Americans to the
idea of electing them. Instead,
Americans have actually come
to embrace the idea of celebrities
in politics. Franken is the latest
proof of that, winning by the nar-
rowest of margins in last year's
Minnesota Senate race. Franken
isn't an A-lister like the Gov-
ernator or Sonny Bono, but his
notoriety as an author and come-
dian was doubtlessly a factor in
his win over incumbent senator
Norm Coleman.
Ironically, Norm Coleman was
no stranger to facing a celebrity
in an election. Coleman lost Min-
nesota's gubernatorial race to for-
mer professional wrestler Jesse
Ventura in 1998. Coleman then
defeated former vice president
and one-time Minnesota senator
Walter Mondale to win his Senate
seat in 2002.
In the Senate, many considered
Coleman a very capable politician.
He sat on important committees,
including the Committee on For-
-eign Relations. Coleman's term
was widely regarded as a success-
ful one, and his work on legislation
for renewable energy and rural
infrastructure helped serve the
needs of Minnesotans. The voters
hardly had reason to remove him
from office - but they did, and
they replaced him with a celebrity.
Something's wrong when Coleman
was able to defeat a former vice
president, but not a comedian.
The first celebrity governor,
Ronald Reagan, started this trend
for awful celebrity politicians back
in the 1960s. His star power even-
tually led him to run for president,
where America decided that it was
in fact a good idea to elect a red-
scare xenophobe. Reagan even-

tually launched a failed defense
program called "Star Wars" and
advocated an inherently flawed
economic system.
As expected, Ventura and
Schwarzenegger's reigns as gov-
ernors have not been without
controversy and criticism. The
media attacked Ventura at nearly
every turn for his absurd number
of vetoes and odd political view-
points. Their relentlesscriticism
is largely considered a reason
why he lasted only one term in
office. And Schwarzenegger's
performance has been inconsis-
tent at best, with his notable fail-
ure occurring when all four ballot
measures he sponsored in a 2005
special election were defeated.
It's a long way
from Hollywood
to Capitol Hill.
From Reagan to Schwarzeneg-
ger to Ventura, America has
given celebrities their chance to
try and positively impact govern-
ment. For the most part, they've
failed miserably. While Franken
provides another chance for a
celebrity to succeed, any success
of his willonly encourage anoth-
er knucklehead to become the
next celebrity politician - like
NBA Hall of Famer Charles Bar-
kley, who continuously declares
his desire to run for governor of
Alabama. The U.S. voters need to
stop falling for these gimmicks
and elect those who truly can
serve our nation.

Northern Illinois University and
Virginia Tech shootings that
occurred within the last two and
a half years, University adminis-
trators are considering equipping
classrooms with doors that lock
from the inside.
Physics Professor Keith Riles
introduced the issue at the Senate
Advisory Committee on Univer-
sity Affairs meeting last month
and said that adding doorknobs
that lock from the inside to Uni-

versity classrooms may help keep
students and staff safe.
Though Riles's idea is currently
not a concrete project, individuals
from the Office of Facilities and
Operations have been conducting
research and collecting feedback
to see if adding doors that lock
from the inside would be benefi-
cial to University classrooms.
Diane Brown, Department of
Public Safety spokeswoman, said
in an interview last week that cur-
rent fire regulations in the state
of Michigan require that all doors
inside campus buildings swing
outward into the hall and that
there is only one step required -
like turning a door handle - for an
individual to exit the room.
All doors currently have a sin-
gle lock that is incorporated into
the doorknob, rather than a dead

bolt and a doorknob, which would
create a second step to exit each
room.
"At home, you have a dead bolt
and a door knob," Brown said.
"That is not permitted in Michi-
gan for fire safety, so we can't just
throw on a lock. It must be inte-
grated into the door handle mech-
anism."
Brown said that if University
administration intends to act upon
Riles' idea, all of the doorknobs in
every building would have to be
replaced. She added that replacing
doorknobs in hundreds of build-
ings and thousands of classrooms
would be costly and time-consum-
ing. Furthermore, the University
would have to decide whether to
replace the doorknobs all at once
or over time as buildings get reno-
vated.

But supporters of the plan think
the benefits of the concept out-
weigh the potential costs. Riles
wrote in an e-mail interview that
it is an important project to ensure
campus safety.
"I happened to be teaching a
class in the Dennison high-rise
the semester of the NIU shoot-
ing," Riles wrote. "(I) realized
that not only could I not lock my
classroom door, but I couldn't
even barricade the door effec-
tively, as was attempted at Vir-
ginia Tech, because the Dennison
doors open to the outside - not
the inside."
Riles wrote that one of the main
arguments against installing the
new locks brought up at the meet-
ing was that doors would be locked
unintentionally, makingclassroom
access difficult during scheduled

class hours, as well as after hours.
Thomas Matthews, a Ross
School of Business senior, said he
doesn't think the new doors should
be installed, fearing that they
would be locked during inconve-
nient times.
"In a situation like the one they
are envisioning it seems like it
would be a good precaution," he
said. "But I like having the class-
rooms open all of the time for
studying."
Brown said that installing the
new doors would be a likely solu-
tion in the event of a threat, but
that it would be a huge and com-
plicated project. She added that if
a project is initiated, University
administration will have to deter-
mine who will finance it and what
the construction process will look
like.

Indie stars unite
on danceable disc

Wilco is trying to break your heart. COURTESY OFNONESUCH
Wilco (the band)
has a good laugh

By ARTHUR VELEZ
Daily Arts Writer
In today's music world, any pre-
conceived notions of what makes
a hit song have
been completely
left behind by the *
rabid nature ofD
the iTunes, blog-
hype machine LP
that largely con- XL
trols popular
music. No longer
is it necessary for an artist to be
able to sing, play an instrument or
even go on tour. The technological
veil of modern music production
has replaced the emphasis on true
talent and musical prowess.
That being said, what propels
songs to astronomical heights now
depends on the inherent catchi-
ness of a band's single. With no
easily located avenue for writing a
sure-fire hit, it's the general public's
guilty pleasures that have dictated
a song's marketability.
Enter Discovery, averitable indie
super group consisting of Rostam
Batmanglij (Vampire Weekend's
keyboard player) and Wes Miles
(lead singer of Ra Ra Riot).
Batmanglij's retro production
- guilty pleasures abound - that
combines elements of 80's pop,
funk, dub and Auto-Tune-laced
R&B, coupled with Miles's pipes,
humor and willingness makes their
debut album something akin to the
musical version of a buddy flick.
The album starts off at a fevered
pitch, opening with what could

be two of the catchiest songs of
the summer, "Orange Shirt" and
"Osaka Loop Line." The two tracks
are marked by handclaps, hi-hats
and soft synths that come to be the
band's callingcards.
The playful, futuristic nature of
Discovery is obvious in the text-
obsessed lyrics of the first track.
Miles bashes his crush, stating
"Every text that I get from you is so
deliberate," and also pointing out
a pet peeve: "You're never looking
when you type T9."
Sadly, everything goes slightly
downhill after such a grand, dance-
able start. Though the album never
returns to the swagger of the first
few tracks, its mix of popular R&B
and indie credibility lends it an air
of hilarity and makes things all OK.
A fine summer
soundtrack.
The eventual downfall of this
ambitious release is its formu-
laic nature. It seems hastily put
together, which makes sense in
light of the fact that this is merely
a side project for two extremely
active musicians. On paper, Miles
and Batmanglij should be the
poster children for a hybridization
of the blogosphere and American
Top 40, but they can't quite make
it. Rushed as it may be, LP certain-
ly has the makings for a perfectly
fine summer soundtrack.

blush - when the "Penny Lane"-ish
horn resounds in the coda of "Ever-
lasting Everything," it's obvious that
the resemblance to The Beatles is
more than a coincidence.
Knowing nods to the Fab Four run
amok on the album, including the
virtual remaking of George Harri-
son's "My Sweet Lord" on "You Never
Know," the Lennon-ized vocals of
"Sonny Feeling" an'd how "Country
Disappeared" fuses Abbey Road's
"Golden Slumbers" and "She Came in
Through the Bathroom Window" so
effortlessly Paul McCartney should
share a writing credit.
But despite all of the winks and
clues, it's less likely that Tweedy and
co. are making a move to usurp the
Liverpudlians from their musical
throne as they are simply admiring
from up close. In true Beatles style,
they're having a good laugh.
Wilco (The Album) is not a grand
artistic statement, nor does it try to
be. Weighing this album against the
rest of the Wilco catalog would be
unfair - this is not Yankee Hotel Fox-
trot 2. Here is a band willfully rest-
ing on their laurels, choosing simple
yet well-crafted songs, deft arrange-
ments and a much-needed chuckle
in favor of attempting to meet the
impossible standards set by their
fans or the ghosts of past releases.
As arguably one of America's
best live bands (those unconvinced
should seek the newly-released live
documentary "Ashes of American
Flags") and creators of a handful of
masterpiece albums, Tweedy and co.
have little left to prove. And having
already scaled the mountain of a long
and varied career, can anyone really
fault them for taking in the view?

Playing cops and robbers

By EMILY BOUDREAU
DailyArts Writer
In the early 1930s, the nation's greatest
fear was not the depression, nor even fear
itself, according to the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation.
America's greatestthreatwas ***
a man named John Dillinger,
or as the FBI called him, Pub- PublC
lic Enemy Number One. Efg ja
"Public Enemies" is direc-
tor Michael Mann's ("Miami Universal
Vice") attempt to capture the At Qaality16
characters of Dillinger (John- and Showcase
ny Depp, "Sweeney Todd")
and the man who dedicated
his life to bringing him to justice, Melvin Pur-
vis (Christian Bale, "Dark Knight"). But Mann
gets a little too caught up in the action of the
movie to fully grasp its central characters.
While there are plenty of machine-gun
fights, car chases and stake outs, the movie
leaves the audience feeling empty. Gunfire and
bank robberies are exciting, but at the same
time, it's important to understand the men
behind them.
As far as criminals go, Dillinger wasn't such a
bad guy, and he was able to outsmart the police
force. While the movie does make a quick ref-
erence to the fact that he let all the customers
keep their money - even giving some of it back
- itnever emphasizes the creativityhe showed
during his robberies. This is surprising for a
film about a man who once robbed a bank by
pretending that he was filming a movie there.
Not only does the movie miss its mark with
Dillinger, but in the time dedicated to fight
scenes, it loses the opportunity to develop the
supporting characters who are also interest-
ing historical figures. J. Edgar Hoover (Billy
Crudup, "Watchmen") comes off as just an
angry man in the film. But in real life, he was
a man obsessed with power and had a gift for

tle more than a costume-less batman. Marion
Cotillard ("A Good Year"), however, is par-
ticularly good as Billie Frechette, Dillinger's
girlfriend. It's only through her character that
any sort of personal depth is added to Dillinger.
Through their relationship, it's possible to see
more of a human being and less of a calculating,
gun-carryingmachine.
Perhaps the flaws of the film are under-
standable. At 140 minutes, "Public Enemies" is
already a long movie, and it's difficult to estab-
lish a subtle balance between fact and action.
TheplotisnotparticularlysurprisingbutMann
does manage to keep the audience wondering-
not about what will happen (as the plot is fairly
predictable), but how it will happen.
Depp does a good job with Dillinger in the
framework he has and manages to capture
Dillinger's sense of humor and daring. This

is apparent when he casually strolls into the
Chicago Police Department's "John Dillinger
Bureau" and asks for the score of the baseball
game.
Depp's Dillinger is
humorous and daring,
but a bit superficial.
"Public Enemies" makes for a good summer
movie because it's entertaining and not too
heavy. While the film could have used more
development, it's still enjoyable and its cast
performs to the best of its ability given the
limited script.

Fans could learn a lot from NASCAR

It starts early on a Saturday
morning as the fans flock from
the furthest reaches of Ann
Arbor and congregate on State
Street to take part in the sacred-
union of pre-gaming. They march
from fraternity houses and dormi-
tories alike to the front steps of the
revered Michigan Stadium - an
arena with over 100 years of tradi-
tion and a follow-
ing that extends
across the entire
country.
And then,
as fans file into
the Big House,
the Wolverine 4
enthusiasts turn
on their "inside CHANTEL
voices" and the JENNINGS

an inaudible sea
of maize, whose, shirts are louder
than their battle cries. It's astadium
known for its football tradition, the
block 'M' and the quietest 100,000
fans in America.
In 2007, Mike Hart pleaded with
fans as he looked off the field and
into the stands for the backing he
and his team needed during games.
"That's when you need the sta-
dium," Hart told The Wolverine in
the 2007 Football Preview Issue.
"That's the one thing we really need
to do this year as fans, as everyone
- make it extra hard for teams com-
ing in here. Show them it's not the
same Big House. It needs to be a lot
crazier."
But nothing has changed. We're
still quiet. We still show up late in
a drunken stupor and leave early,
stumbling home to nap before we
leave for late-night adventures with
the game out of sight and out of
mind.
Oh, how quickly we forget the
moments we will never forget and
instead, move onto escapades few
will be able to remember the next
day.
Something needs to change. And
we need to look to someone to show
us how.

We can paint our chests and turn
men's shirts into dresses but it's a
useless show of school spirit if we
only stay for a quarter.
Didn't Bo say, "Those who stay
will be champions?" Sorry Bo: We,
as fans, have failed you. We, as fans,
have failed the team.
That's one thing diehard
NASCAR fans will never compro-
mise. Their cholesterol? Sure. Their
refinement? You bet. But their loy-
alty? Not a chance.
During one interview I asked a
man, "So, win or lose, Dale Earn-
hardt Jr. is your guy, right?"
He looked at me, petrified, and
questioned why I was asking about
gay rights. Decades of being a
NASCAR fan had deteriorated his
hearing to the point that "guy, right"
sounded like "gay rights."
But later, he agreed - win or lose,
he would support Earnhardt. And it
was pretty clear partial deafness
didn't phase his staunch fandom. If
anything, it made the sound of the
cars on the track more therapeutic.
You can't say as much for Michi-
gan. After a single losing season,
some fans have already begun to
doubt Rich Rodriguez and the Wol-
verines.
Last April, an article appeared in
USA Today that said "The Wolver-
ines must improve dramatically in
Rodriguez's second season, or one
of the nation's biggest fanbases will
become restless" (Michigan - Team
Notes, 04/28/2009).

Sept. 5 is coming faster than you
think. Our offseason is slowly dwin-
dling into preseason, and what have
you done to prepare?
Do you really think Michigan
football fans bleed maize and blue?
I haven't seen so much as a paper
cut recently.

College, Pa. - governs the students'
lives starting every Thursday. Stu-
dents have to earn seats close to
the field based on dedication. They
take football so seriously that there
is a registered student group that
actually governs Paternoville. They
have a website with rules and regu-
lations, a Facebook and a Twitter.
The Izzone is whatgivestheSpar-
tans a true home court advantage at
the Breslin Center. You have to earn
your spot in the Izzone by missing
no more than two games - if you
make the cut, that is, by attending
the annual Izzone campout and are
a returning Izzone member. The
Spartans can get 3,000-plus fans to
show up wearing all white and are
one of the best student sections in
college basketball.
But I will uphold our validated
stubborn view and refuse to look at
any other Big Ten school as superior
to Michigan - at anything.
So I took it upon myself to step
away from the collegiate sports and
set out and find our own personal
"super fan" - a paradigm of fandom

in all its stupefying glory.
I just didn't think I would find my
muse on a cloudless Sunday at the
Michigan International Speedway.
I was pretty skeptical when I
showed up to MIS. I had never had
a desire to watch or learn or even be
around NASCAR.
After arriving at MIS, it didn't
take me long to meander out of the
grandstand area toward a throng
of Winnebagos heavily scented of
bratwursts and Bud Light. It's here
that I was quickly enveloped in a
society of fandom I had never expe-
rienced.
In the NASCAR world, unlike
Ann Arbor, fans don't limit their
tailgates to the day of the event.
Some came as early as Wednesday
afternoon to start the preparations
for Sunday afternoon's race. Some
students don't even know who
Michigan's opponent is until Fri-
day.
One couple I met had called in
sick to work on Wednesday, Thurs-
day and Friday so they could drive
to MIS from Traverse City. They

would do anything to set up asclose
to the Speedway as possible.
Still, the closest spot they could
find was 15 Winnebagos away.
They told me nothing could keep
them away from their long weekend
in Brooklyn, which has become a
yearly tradition for them.
Come rain or shine, Hell or high
water, they would annually camp
out for five days to watch cars race
around an elliptical track for no rea-
son except that they want to. Most
don't have an affiliation to the team
or driver, unlike us Wolverines that
are expected to be Michigan fans
because of our enrollment at the
University.
As I sat with them under their
awning, listening to their stories of
dedication from past campouts and
races, I could only think of last sea-
son's game against Northwestern on
Nov. 15 in less than favorable condi-
tions. In the Wolverines last home
game of the season, only 40,000
total fans made it to halftime -
with the student section only about
20 percent full.

MEN'S TRACK AND FIELD
Final race brings senior back to beginning

Harmsen finishes
unlikely success at
U.S. Olympic Trials
By FELIX CARREON .
Daily Sports Writer
Last year, then-redshirt junior
Dan Harmsen sat in the stands,
eagerly taking in the action of the
2008 U.S. Olympic Trials.
But this year Harmsen was in
the middle of the action, compet-
ing against some of the very same
athletes he watched a year ago at
the U.S. Track and Field Nationals,
June 25 - 28.
Harmsen finished 17th in the
preliminaries of the 400-meter
hurdles at the historic Hayward
Field in Eugene, Ore.

"It was a once in a lifetime
opportunity," Harmsen said. "It
was so cool to be there with the
best athletes, not only in the nation
but the world."
Racing against NCAA champion
Jeshua Anderson of Washington
State University and runner-up
Johnny Dutch of South Carolina,
Harmsen had to quickly adapt to
the faster pace. Through five hur-
dles, he was among the leaders,
but a technical error led to a loss
of momentum and a lost spot in the
semifinals.
As Harmsen was heading into
the final 100 meters, he cleared
the eighth hurdle but was forced to
change his step pattern. The slip-
up caused him to hurdle with his
non-dominant leg and lose some
ground on the field, finishing sixth
in the heat.

But Harmsen's journey to

In 6th grade, Harmsen traveled
to the University of Washington
to compete in the U.S. National
Junior Olympics - an experience
he shared with his father, Mark
Harmsen, who competed for the
Michigan track and cross country
teams.
The elder Harmsen videotaped
not only his son's performance in
the race but everything from his
entrance into the stadium to his
pre-race warmups. Harmsen com-
peted in the pentathlon - which
consists of the 100-meter hurdles,
shot-put, high jump, long jump and
1500-meter run - all at the age of
12.
The meet provided him with his
first taste of the national track and
