Yost After Hours:A'M' women's hockey

ONE-HUNDRED-TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM Wednesday. July 16.2014

Daily Sports Writer
Entering Yost Ice Arena with
the women's hockey team on the
ice is like walking into an office
after hours. It's one of the most
historic college rinks in the coun-
try, but the lights are half-dimmed
and the building is cold. The muf-
fled sounds of skates and pucks
fill the air. Winged helmets move
about the ice, but the wings are in
yellow tape on store-bought navy
helmets.
This is not the perennial cham-
pionship-contending men's team
coached by Red Berenson. This is
Michigan women's hockey. This is
a team where reality hits its play-
ers square in the face with every
drop of sweat.
Still, it's life for players who
have passed up bigger opportuni-
ties to play here.
"You need something to kind of
keep you going, and that for me is
hockey," said sophomore alternate
captain Jenna Trubiano.
Offered a roster spot on a var-
sity squad elsewhere, she instead
chose to play closer to her New
Baltimore,

nities for girls to play hockey in
the state of Michigan after high
school. While there was a Division
I team at Wayne State in Detroit, it
folded after succumbing to finan-
cial pressure. There are now just
two programs in the state - Fin-
landia University and Adrian Col-
lege - both Division III.
"As a female hockey player, the
number one thing you have to look
at is academics, but I think it's
kind of ridiculous that there's not
a women's D-I team to pursue in
the state of Michigan," Trubiano
said. "It's embarrassing, actually."
Susan McDowell is officially an
assistant coach for the women's
hockey team, but her experience
with the sport goes back decades.
She co-founded the team in 1994
and played at the college level.
It has been 17 years since wom-
en's hockey was up for varsity
appointment at Michigan. In 1997,
the Athletic Department put three
women's sports up for varsity-
appointment - soccer, water polo
and hockey - to choose two.

A rising fifth-year senior, Ann
Arbor native Monica Korzon,
captained AAA Detroit Honey-
baked to a state championship and
played several seasons at SUNY
Plattsburgh in upstate New York,
winning two D-III national cham-
pionships.
"My dad really wanted a son,
and he never got one," Korzon
said. "His equivalent was turn-
ing his four daughters into hockey
players. For me, it's a family sport.

and hockey as
the remaining
two sports for
promotion.
"They ended up taking water
polo," McDowell said. "The anec-
dotal information was that water
polo was going to be a $350,000
a year investment (all-inclusive),
whereas ice hockey would have
been a $750,000-800,000 deal."
The justification for the
appointment ranges from travel
costs to facility maintenance. At
the time, Canham Natatorium was
entering just its seventh year of
operation, having enough capacity
to support an extra team.
Soccer already had practice
fields and game fields in place,
leaving the question of how to
divide ice time at Yost Arena. The
process never got that far, and ice
hockey was tabled for females due

to facility and fiscal constraints.
Promoting the longtime club
sport to varsity status would pres-
ent a couple of issues. First is Title
IX, which could require the school
to add another men's sport to
accompany the addition of wom-
en's varsity hockey.
Furthermore, in order for
Michigan to maintain two varsity
hockey programs in the eyes of
the Athletic Department, it needs
two rinks, as opposed to moving
the women into Yost with the
men.
"It's not impossible," Athletic
Director Dave Brandon told The
Detroit News in January. "But,
if you were to do it the right way,
which is the Michigan way, you'd
build a facility with two sheets of
ice."
Building another facility would
add a hefty startup fee to travel
and maintenance costs for the new
varsity sport.
"It would certainly draw some
fan attraction, as all of our teams
do," Brandon told the News. "But
I'm sure the fan interest in it
would be far below the cost of the
program."
In the late 1990s, one of Michi-
gan's chief rivals, Ohio State,
forged onward with creating
women's teams. Using a selective
process, a group of athletic offi-
cials decided to create women's

ROTC members,
officers and alumni
say goodbye to
historic building
By MICHAEL SPAETH
For the Daily
Friday, members of the Univer-
sity's Reserve Officers Training
Corps held a small ceremony on
the front lawn of North Hall to pay
tribute to the building they called
home for 74 years in advance of its
scheduled demolition.
The building is being demol-
ished to make room for the new
300,000-square foot Biological
Science Building, approved by the
University's Board of Regents in
February, which will house the
Department of Molecular, Cellu-
lar and Developmental Biology, the
Department of Ecology and Evo-
lutionary Biology, and collections
from the Anthropology, Natural
History, Paleontology and Zoology
museums.
At the event, current and retired
members of the University's Air
Force, Army and Navy ROTC units
adapted the traditional Naval
decommissioning ceremony, which
signifies the end of a Naval ship's
active service, to mark the end of
North Hall's service to the Univer-
sity.
Captain Joseph Evans, professor
of Naval Science and Commander
of the University's Naval ROTC,
said though the building was never
commissioned as a ship, it served
the same symbolic purpose.

ship, faithfully served us all and all

heads push for more

In a lawsuit filed in state claims

University of Michigan Health
System faculty members and
administrators are searching the
country for the hospital's next
leader - and they want sugges-
tions.
Ora Pescovitz, former Execu-
tive Vice President for Medical
Affairs at UMHS, announced in
March that she. would step down
at the end of her initial five year
appointment in June. The Univer-
sity appointed a 13-person Advi-
sory Committee in May to find her
replacement, which includes six
professors, several hospital admin-
istrators, Martin Philbert, dean of
the School of Public Health, and
CynthiaWilbanks,the University's
vice president for government rela-
tions.
On Thursday, committee mem-
bers held an open forumfor UMHS
faculty and staff to hear their col-
leagues' opinions on what quali-
ties should be sought in the next

orteilccai acooi, te os -
tals and Health Centers, the School
of Nursing and the Michigan
Health Corporation. The EVPMA
is one of 13 senior officers of the
University, and he or she reports to
the University president.
Dr. Paul Lee, director of the Kel-
logg Eye Center and chair of the
Department of Ophthalmology
and Visual Science and head of the
Search Advisory Committee, led
the forum. He began by opening
the room to questions and concerns
relating to the search process.
Human Genetics Prof. Miriam
Meisler said she thought the basic
sciences have been neglected in
the University Medical School over
the past few years. To remedy this
problem, she said she hoped for an
executive with research experi-
ence.
"I think it would be very much
an asset if you could find some-
body who has actually functioned
as a (National Institutes of Health)
sponsored principle investiga-
tor, who knows research from the
inside and who understands the
challenges of the system," Meisler

applicants.i ey also inciuae lea-
ership experience, understanding
of current health policy, knowl-
edge of management techniques
and experience with philanthropy.
As well, in what may be the most
restricting criteria for the position,
the committee has required that
applicants hold either an M.D. or
equivalent degree.
Lee said this requirement was
not automatic, and the search com-
mittee discussed the topic exten-
sively before deciding that the
academic qualification was neces-
sary.
The extensive list of standards
mostly comes from the large scale,
prestigious nature the position.
UMHS has an annual operat-
ing budget of $3.4 billion, and in
2013 U.S. News and World Report
ranked UMHS as the number one
hospital in Michigan. Many spe-
cialties were also ranked high
nationally.
However, despite the hospital's
achievements in past years, Inter-
nal Medicine Prof. James Shayman
told the committee he feels that
the health system has lost substan-

ieaaers ana set the stanaara in
discovery, patient care and educa-
tion," Shayman said. "We're start-
ing with the presumption that
we've reached that point, and who-
ever we find to fill the role is going
to maintain the status quo. Person-
ally, I would find that search to be
a failure."
The process the University is
utilizing to find the new EVPMA
is the same that was used to find
new University president Mark
Schlissel. Both nominations and
applications will be accepted for
the position, and from the original
applicant pool the committee will
then narrow it down to a smaller
group of contenders and eventually
choose a final candidate. The list of
candidates will not be released to
the public.
The committee plans to search
throughout the fall, with the goal
of having the new EVPMA begin
work January 1, 2015. Until the
position is filled, Michael Johns,
professor of otolaryngology and
health policy at Emory Univer-
sity, will continue to act as interim
EVPMA.

CSG's response to the student
football ticket policy, on the other
hand, was a win for Proppe and
Dishell. Executives worked closely
with the athletic department and
were able to revise the student
ticket policy from last year, which
worked on a first-come-first serve
basis that many upperclassmen felt
was unfair, since they had expected
to get priority seating for senior
year upon entering the school.
Dishell said he hasn't heard much
feedback since aboutthe new policy
but understands that some students
are disappointed with the schedule
of games, a decision made solely by

years in advance.
Other important points carry-
ing over from last year are relations
between the CSG and University
administration, as well as the Uni-
versity's efforts to improve sexual
assault prevention.
The CSG task force investigation
of the University's sexual assault
services and the Office of Student
Conflict Resolution was another
accomplishment for CSG last year.
In the wake of the news that foot-
ball team kicker Brendan Gibbons
had been permanently separated
from the University for sexual
assault, the-task force found that
the University has been under-
staffed and ill-equipped to handle
the high volume of reported cases.
Their findings were submitted as a
contribution to a federal investiga-

tion of the school by the Depart-
ment of Education, the results of
which should be made public soon,
Dishell said.
Dishell has also met with new
UniversityPresident Mark Schlissel
and he said he feels there is an open
line of communication between the
two. Administration worked heav-
ily with student groups this past
year, most notably in response to
the Black Student Union's demands
for improved racial climate on cam-
pus and in facilitating discussions
during the SAFE sit-in.
Dishell said the University's
choice to exclude students from
the presidential search committee
was a setback for CSG's relation-
ship with administrators, but that
it has since created an avenue for
improved contact.

S 55 ** University to take on
enrollment mgmt. effort

New associate VP
position to provide
more cohension in
admissions process
By SHOHAM GEVA
ManagingNews Editor
Tuesday,KedraIshop, alongtime
admissions official at the Univer-
sity of Texas-Austin, stepped down
from her position as the school's
admissions director to join the Uni-
versity of Michigan in a new effort
to increase cohesion and supportfor
students in the admissions process.
Ishop was approved by the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents for the
newly created position of associ-
ate vice president of enrollment
management during their monthly
meeting on June 19. Her appoint-

ment begins on September 1.
The timing of her resignation
from UT-Austin has attracted some
scrutiny, as the school undergoes an
external admissions audit currently
underway at the school, announced
by the UT system June 20, four days
after she notified school officials
of the planned move. The audit is
in response to a series of allega-
tions that certain individuals, such
as state legislators' children and
friends, received unfair advantages
during the admissions process at
UT-Austin.
In an e-mail interview last
Wednesday, Ishop wrote that she
chose to make the move primarily
because of the University's reputa-
tion and the nature of the position.
She and UT-Austin officials have
previously stated that plans for the
move began well before the audit
was announced.

est side of Detroit,

id by its atmosohere.

A vibrant Mexican culture exists in
the appropriately named Mexican-
town, Hungarian culture thrives
in Delray, and historic homes are
the highlight in Naoum's neighbor-
hood, Hubbard Farms.
Naoum said she was drawn to
the neighborhood because of peo-
ple she knew and the lifestyle that
Southwest offers. There's a com-
munity garden and Clark Park,
which ishome to constant activities
and recreational opportunities.
Above all else, though, Naoum
said she values the community of
people that surrounds her.
"Because safety is an issue in
Detroit, I wanted to live some-
where where the residents are tak-
ing charge of that," she said.
In an effort to supplement the
police department, Hubbard Farms
residents use a community-run tex-
ting group and an e-mail listserv
that is accessible to members of
the community to look out for one
another. One of Naoum's elderly
neighbors can consistently be
found perched on his front porch,
keeping an eye on everyone's com-
ings and goings.
"We watch out for each other
because crime is present, but it
makes me feel much better know-

ing that if I screamed on my block,
there's 5 people who would come
out of their house immediately to
help," she said.
Even though crime is more
prevalent in Detroit than on the
University's campus in Ann Arbor
- according to the FBI 2012 unified
crime report, the city was the sec-
ond most dangerous in the United
States after Flint - she said she
feels safer in Detroit. It might seem
counter-intuitive, but Naoum said
her neighbors are what make all the
difference.
"In Ann Arbor, people are
screaming day in and day out, and
nobody does anything about it
because one, youthink it's someone
being drunk and stupid, or two, at
least when I was in Ann Arbor, I
felt no accountability for my neigh-
bors," she said. "With Detroit, I
think the opposite is true."
Growing a future in Detroit
When Cory Froning was a soph-
omore at the University, she signed
up for Semester in Detroit on a
whim. An Ann Arbor native, her
impression of Detroit was primar-
ily negative - she had heard of the
dangers of the city, the violence

LAWSUIT

suggests.
"We don't believe it's acceptable
that the public is essentially cut
out of these meetings, considering
the law and the bedrock idea that
the public has a right to under-
stand how such an important pub-
lic institution conducts itself," he
said.
This isn't the first time that the
University's meeting practices
have come under scrutiny. In Feb-
ruary, state Rep. Tom McMillin
(R-Rochester Hills) held a hearing
about the public's concerns about
the act during which Herschel
Fink, a member of the Free Press's
legal team, said the University are
"serial abusers of the Open Meet-
ings Act."
McMillin has since introduced
two bills to amend the Act. The
bills would make public officials

her walls knows well that it's
formed a personality all of its
own, full of character and spirit,"
Evans said.
He added that in a sense the
building was a vessel, not for
traveling on water but for the
training of students.
North Hall was built between
1899 and 1900, and is the second-
oldest building on campus still in
use after the President's House.
From 1900 to 1922, the build-
ing served as the University's
Homeopathic Hospital. It then
became the South Department
Hospital after the University
stopped studying homeopathy.
In the early 1940s, the build-
ing was renamed North Hall and
became home to the University's
Navy ROTC program, with the
University's Army and Air Force
ROTC programs joining a decade
later. All three programs relo-
cated to the Chemistry building
last May.
During the ceremony, Evans
highlighted several memorable
moments in North Hall's history.
On December 8, 1941 - the day
after Japan attacked Pearl Har-
bor during World War II - a local
newspaper reported that more
than 100 University students
stood outside the commanding
officer's office to sign up to fight
in the war, he said.

who violate it intentionally crimi-
nally and civilly liable, as well as
clarify that closed meetings are
permissible only about current,
ongoing legislation, not legislation
that's anticipated, as decided in a
recent state Court of Appeals case.
Following University President-.
elect Mark Schlissel's selection
in January, concerns were also
raised on secrecy specifically in
the presidential search process.
All Michigan public universities
have been allowed to conduct
presidential searches in private as
of a 1999 Michigan Supreme Court
decision.
Additionally, in 2010 Univer-
sity alum Robert Davis settled a
case with the University under the
Open Meetings Act over their fail-
ure to hold a public meeting while
discussing an NCAA investigation
of the University's football pro-
gram.
In an e-mail statement Sunday
afternoon, University spokesman
North Hall was also bombed
three times. The first, in June
1969, was felt two miles away
and broke 60 windows, though
nobody was injured.
University alum Captain Phil
Klintworth, an executive con-
sultant at Tetra Tech and former
professor of Naval Science who
also spoke at the event, said in
an interview after the ceremo-
ny that he was surprised there
wasn't more of an effort to pre-
serve North Hall as a historic
landmark. However, he added
that he agreed with the regents'
decision.
"From a practical standpoint, I
mean, the building is old, it cer-
tainly doesn't meet fire codes,
it's very expensive to keep it in
repair," he said. "If I were on the
Board of Regents, I'd probably
make the same call."
Commander Scott Howell,
associate professor of Naval Sci-
ence and Executive Officer of the
University's Naval ROTC Unit,
said before the ceremony that the
event was bittersweet. He added
that moving forward, he would
like to see the University's ROTC
program continue to thrive and
increase its campus visibility.
"I'm proud of our students,"
Howell said. "They're an amaz-
ing bunch of young men and
women who volunteer to serve
the country, go to school - I mean,
this is a tough school to get into, so
they're extremely bright, extreme-
ly intelligent.".

Rick Fitzgerald wrote that the
University has not yet been served
with the lawsuit and therefore
could not comment.
In an interview with The Mich-
igan Daily in February, Fitzgerald
said the University believes that
the regent's meeting practices are
both legal and effective.
"The process that the board
operates under is well-established
and well-grounded in the state
law," Fitzgerald said at the time.
"This has been an effective way to
work and we believe it is compli-
ant with the Open Meetings Act."
Among other public colleges
in Michigan, Wayne State Uni-
versity also held a private presi-
dential search process this year
and Michigan State University
also has conducted sessions of
their governing board in private,
according to The Free Press.

FROM THE DAILY
Oening the doors
The University must provide better transparency to the public
Last Friday, The Detroit Free Press filed a lawsuit against
the University of Michigan citing several alleged violations
against the Michigan Opening Meetings Act. The lawsuit
focuses on the behavior of the University's Board of Regents and
their meetings. In January 2013 and January 2014, the regents met
in California and New York, respectively, in lieu of their monthly
public meeting in Ann Arbor. This, alongside numerous questionable
unanimous votes, suggests the University isn't acting in accordance
with OMA. The University and the Board of Regents must be more
transparent with the public and stop directly violating OMA.

Former Michigan softball
player Amanda Chidester's college
career ran right in the middle of
the team's current streak of seven
straight Big Ten championships.
Now, she has a second World
Cup of Softball title to call her own.
Chidester started five of seven
games for Team USA in the World
Cup of Softball, which ended
Sunday with the Americans'
5-2 win over Canada in the
championship game.
The U.S. breezed through
last week's round-robin format,
beating each of the six other
teams by a combined score of
43-7. Then, after topping Canada
Thursday, 5-3, the Americans met

the Canadians, who finished 5-1
in round-robin play, again Sunday
for the title.
Chidester, who graduated in
2012, was a Big Ten Player of the
Year twice and an All-American
twice. She ranks in the top 10
in school history in five major
offensive categories.
The 24-year-old native of Allen
Park, Michigan hit a three-run
home run to secure an 8-1 mercy-
rule win Fridayover Japan, which
ousted the U.S. last year in the
championship game. Chidester
added two RBI in a 14-0 rout of
Chinese Taipei on Saturday. She
finished the tournament 5-for-13
with three runs scored.
The U.S. will also play in the
World Championships starting
Aug.12 in Haarlem, Netherlands.

Graham Glasgow was sentenced Monday for a charge of operating while visually impaired stemmingtfrom a March 15 arrest.
Glasgow sentenced to
12 months probation


In 1976, Michigan
established OMA with several
provisions that limitgoverning
public bodies' actions and
promote transparency with
their constituents. Public
bodies, such as the Board of
Regents, must announce their
meetings within 10 days before
their first annual meeting,
keep detailed records during
meetings, hold meetings
available to the general public
and give time for public input.
The regents seemingly
violated several of OMA's
provisions by holding informal
discussions behind closed
doors about University issues.
From January 2013 to February
2014, the board only publicly
discussed about 10 percent of
the issues presented to them
throughout the year. Similarly,
of 116 votes, only eight saw a
dissenting vote. It's unrealistic

to believe that the board
unanimously decided so many
issues - including renovations
to several buildings, a major
student housing project,
renovations to the president's
residence and projects for the
University hospital - without
some sort of communication or
conversation. These and other
impactful funding decisions
should incorporate public
involvement and voices.
The regents further alienated
the public by holding two
meetings in locations outside of
Michigan. Each year, the board
holds nine meetings in Ann
Arbor, one in Dearborn and one
in Flint to discuss University-
related issues. In January 2013
and January 2014, the regents
met in California and New
York, respectively, in lieu of
their monthly public meeting
in Michigan. Hosting sessions

in other states eliminates public
access and violates section
three of OMA.
During the past few years,
the Board of Regents has
become increasingly exclusive.
In October 2012, the University
implemented a policy where a
rope barrier was placed around
the regents table separating
officials from the public.
Similarly, regents rarely give
the public feedback on concerns
raised by attendees. These
actions promote exclusivity
and distrust among the public.
As millions of tax dollars and
the tuition of students help
fund the University, the regents
must stop their secretive
discussions and provide more
transparency for everyone.
University students and
Michigan residents deserve to
know exactly what the regents
are doing with their money.

Redshirt junior
must pay $885 in
fines, avoid alcohol
during probation
By JAKE LOURIM
ManagingSports Editor
Redshirt junior offensive
lineman Graham Glasgow
was sentenced to 12 months of
probation and a total of $885
in fines Monday in Ann Arbor
District Court after a guilty
plea to operating while visually
impaired.
On June 16, Glasgow pled
guilty to the lesser misdemeanor
after the initial charge, operating
while intoxicated, was amended.
Monday, Judge Joseph Burke
issued the sentence, which also
mandates that Glasgow complete
six days of community service by
Dec. 31..
Glasgow's attorney, John Shea,
did not have any objections to
the presentencing report but
did approach the judge first to
address a matter.
The judge then asked for any
comments from Shea or Glasgow,
at which point both expressed

Blake Countess was named to the Thorpe and Nagurski Award Watch Lists.
Watch List Update:
Countess on two lists

By JAKE LOURIM
Managing Sports Editor
The Preseason Watch Lists
for the National College Football
Awards Association awards come
out from July 7 to July 18. Last
week, redshirt junior defensive
back Blake Countess added his
name to the list of Michigan play-
ers to watch when he was named
to the Brongo Nagurski watch list
for best defensive player and the
Jim Thorpe watch list for best
defensive back. Senior defensive
end Frank Clark and fifth-year
senior linebacker Jake Ryan, who
were both named to other watch

lists last week, also made the
Nagurski list.
Countess inspired hope for
the future when he started six
games and made 44 tackles as a
true freshman in 2011. But a torn
ACL suffered in the 2012 season
opener against Alabama set his
career back a bit.
He got back on the field last
season after a redshirt year, mak-
ing 46 tackles and intercepting a
conference-best six passes. The
media elected him first-team All-
Big Ten after he started every
game, and he should be poised to
take on a bigger role on defense
this year.

"Gaga in Malaga, / No mercy in
Murcia") on "Neal Cassady Drops
Dead" and "The Bullfighter Dies."
At other times, as on "Staircase
at the University" or "Earth is
the Loneliest Place," it's hard not
to think that, like a TV psychic,
Morrissey's lyrics only succeed
in speaking to people by virtue of
their vagueness.
On a purely musical level, more
often than not Morrissey seems to
be at war with his band. There are
a few instrumental gems, like the
glittering guitars and keyboards on
"I'm Not a Man," and the splashes

most of the whininess present on
his earlier material while main-

to and fail to cohere with the music
going on around him.
The most disappointing aspect
ofWorldPeace,however,isthe ines-
capable feeling that I've heard this
all before. The instrumentals pro-
vided by Morrissey's band combine
an eclectic group of influences into
a combination that, rather than cre-
ating something new and exciting,
sounds like a group of studio musi-
cians rehashing ideas from their
other projects. With the exception
of songs like "Smiler With Knife"
and "Istanbul," a number of his
lyrics seem like leftovers from his
earlier albums and others simply
repackage platitudes as profound
discoveries - he astutely observes
on the closingtrack "Oboe Concer-
to" that, yes, the "round rhythm of
life goes round."
While the more devoted Mor-
rissey fans will likely see the same
biting social commentary and
brooding lyricism in World Peace
as they do in his other work, I can't
say that he's succeeded in casting
me under his spell.

has been the case with Israel
time and again, a fact made clear
during Friday's pro-Palestinian
protest near the Diag. In the
crowd of 100 or so peaceful
demonstrators, one sign stuck
out: it was adorned with
swastikas and read "Nazi Israel

I spoke with the person
holding the sign, a middle
aged Palestinian man named
Muhammad. He claimed Israel's
policies of stealing land, killing
civilians and operating prison
camps qualified it as a "Nazi
country." He also claimed that
only a week earlier, his home
in Gaza had been destroyed.
This type of system, he told me,
must be "uprooted" (the word he

By WILL GREENBERG
Daily News Editor
In case you didn't know, last
year was an incredibly busy pair of
semesters for the Central Student
Government.
Maybe it was something in
the air, maybe it was just a high
demand for involvement from
a restless student body, but the
activity was electric.'
Admittedly, not all of the action
was particularly cheery. Fall 2013
saw students voice their displea-
sure with the football student tick-
et policy, incidents like the Theta
Xi racist party and the University's
refusmal to allow students onnthe

presidential search committee.
From there, the winter brought
social movements like the #BBUM
Twitter campaign, which incited a
response from University admin-
istrators. CSG also conducted its
own investigation into sexual mis-
conduct, prompted by The Michi-
gan Daily's exclusive story on
Brendan Gibbons' permanent sep-
aration from the University. There
was also the #UMDivest campaign
to divest funds from companies
that hold contracts with Israeli
militia, led by the Students Allied
for Freedom and Equality.
Public Policy senior Bobby
Dishell, newly-elected CSG Presi-
dent and last year's vice presi-
dent alongside president Michael
Proppe, this coming school year
should be a chance to continue his
work from last year.
Dishell said he has been work-
ing primarily on two projects
over the summer. The first is con-
tinuina wor non at vear's Niaht

Owl bus route, which had success
in helping increase safe evening
transportation for students on the
weekends. The second, new men-
tal health program the Wolverine
Support Network, which looks to
supplement the University's Coun-
seling and Psychological Services
office, comes from Dishell's presi-
dential campaign,
He said he is in the midst of dis-
cussions with CAPS and several
student organizations, though he
declined to state who he's worked
with until plans are more final.
The plan is for the program to
be staffed by student volunteers
trained by CAPS. Dishell said the
current CAPS offices fail to cre-
ate an ideal space for discussion,
something that a student-run pro-
gram would better facilitate. He
added that the program would be
funded by CSG and be up-and-
running by the Winter Term at the
latest.
"Peer sunnnrt - it's hen dem-

onstrated at the high school level
and also on a few different college
campuses - is an effective way to
help foster mental health," he said.
As the incoming president,
Dishell also takes on the position
in the fall with both previous suc-
cesses and previous shortcomings
from lastyear's assembly.
The handling of the #UMDi-
vest campaign was the most con-
troversial issue from last year. It
started as a proposal from Stu-
dents Allied for Freedom and
Equality that encouraged the Uni-
versity to divest from companies
working with Israel. The resolu-
tion received neither approval nor
disapproval from the assembly;
the CSG assembly instead chose
to indefinitely postpone the reso-
lution, which then-CSG presi-
dent Michael Proppe said was an
unprecedented action at the time.
The result was a sit-in staged by
SAFE and their allies in the CSG
chambers.ceatinga ntenseca m-

pus conflict, where threats were
exchanged between students on
either side of the issue. The reso-
lution was eventually voted down
the following week at the most
highly-attended CSG meeting of
the year.
The incident was largely consid-
ered a failure of CSG to give a voice
to the student body by postponing
the vote instead of taking a stand
on either side. While Dishell was
not a voting member of the assem-
bly as vice president and will still
not be as president, he acknowl-
edged that he could have done a
better job of reaching out to both
sides and facilitating conversation.
He said he expects this year's
representatives are prepared to
properly represent the student.

work on a case-by-case basis to
decide if any other action would

Season premiere is
light on spectacle and
heavy on pathos
By CHLOE GILKE
DailyArts Writer
All puns aside, the season pre-
miere of "Masters of Sex" does not
disappoint. After an impressive
freshman season, "Masters" seems
to have matured during its hiatus,
smoothing out
some plodding A
plotlines and
making better Maste
use of its emo- S
tional appeal.
The most Sewon 2

engaging part
of the first sea- Showtime
son was the Sundaysat10p.m.
relationship
between star-
crossed co-workers Bill Masters
(Michael Sheen, "Frost/Nixon")
and Virginia Johnson (Lizzy
Caplan, "Party Down"), and season
two wastes no time in answering
the question of their romantic fate.
The episode is creatively' struc-
tured like a parallax, with each
reminiscing about the aftermath
of Bill proclaiming his love for Vir-
ginia. First, Bill waits quietly in the
bed, lying nearly motionless as he
overhears half of Virginia's phone
call with Ethan. Later, when we
hear Virginia's conversation from
her point of view, we realize the
full extent of what Bill was fearing.

After the will-they-or-won't-they
of their sex study in the first sea-
son, something about this round is
different. It isn't just the absence
of wires and non-clinical setting.
Bill and Virginia are bringing their
affair into the real world, where
it has real consequences. Virginia
finally calls it off with lovesick
puppy Ethan, and stoic Bill can't
escape the guilt of betraying his
lovely wife and new baby. With the
formulaic sex study out of the way,
"Masters of Sex" can explore the
real consequences of intimacy.
These are the same characters
we met last season, but each seems
to be injected with an unapologetic
new vigor. The writers are practi-
cally daring viewers to continue
liking Bill. When Libby (Caitlin
FitzGerald, "Newlyweds") leaves
baby Johnny home with daddy
as the babysitter, Bill blasts The
Everly Brothers instead of attend-
ing to his wailing child. When his
own mother comes to rescue the
kid, he berates her. He lies to Libby
about his whereabouts, driving all
the way to Illinois for an anony-
mous night with Virginia. Now,
he doesn't have the cushion of his
.sex study to act as an excuse for
his behavior. He's even anxious
to terminate his professional rela-
tionship with Virginia, refusing
her help as a secretary and leav-
ing her to supplement her income
by selling diet pills. But, somehow,
it's impossible to hate him. Despite
antics that would make Don Drap-
er shake his head in disapproval,
Michael Sheen plays Bill as a deplor-

able (but sympathetic) asshole.
This is hardly half of the amaz-
ing pathos that "Masters of Sex"
squeezes from just two episodes.
Scene-stealer Margaret Scully
(Allison Janney, "The West Wing")
continues to deal with husband
Barton's homosexuality. Barton
(Beau Bridges, "The Descendants")
undergoes electric shock therapy
for his "condition," and in a heart-
breaking scene, tries to prove he's
cured by seducing his wife. When
he asks her to turn over, Margaret
delivers the ultimate gut-punch
and says, "There is only a shred of
me left that still feels like a woman.
You can't take that from me. I won't
let you." After a close call with Bar-
ton, Janney brings her already-fan-
tastic performance to another level.
The season's second episode,
"Kyrie Eleison," is a return to
normalcy, but the relationship
dynamics have shifted so much
that it hardly feels familiar. Bill
is back to seeing patients (a sex-
crazed teen this time), Virginia
deals with a creepy research part-
ner and Libby once again tries
to bridge racial boundaries with
little success. While certainly qui-
eter, this episode is another pow-
erhouse.
"Masters of Sex" is easily the
best drama of the summer, perhaps
up there with the greats airing dur-
ing the rest of the year. Though the
title might be a turn-off for some,
the show actually focuses com-
paratively little of its energy on
sex and spectacle. It's compelling,
pathos-driven drama at its finest.

Whatever might be said about
Steven Patrick Morrissey, there is
no doubt that modern pop culture
would not exist
as it does with- C
out him. The
antipodean cul- World Peace

fusing his music is None
- both with the of Your

for countless

ment musicians
to achieve suc-
cess, while his ability to craft an
enigmatic, yet profoundly relatable
identity both on and off the stage
made the very idea of larger-than-
life pop stars like Bono, Madonna
and even Kanye West a possibility.
While traces of that looming
presence are visible on Morrissey's
latest album World Peace Is None
Of Your Business, close inspection
reveals the cracks in the fagade of
the singer's sphinxlike persona.
Fans of the British rocker -
of which there are many of the
die-hard variety - praise him
for his melancholy lyrics tinged
with shades of dark humor, his
subversive political songs and for

three of those elements are pres-
ent on World Peace, and a few of
the album's tracks are as troubling
and beautiful as any of the singer's
work. The soaring choruses of
"Istanbul" explore the tortured
psyche of a failed father over bit-
terly resonant guitars while, on
"Smiler With Knife," Morrissey
wallows in suicidal longing over
dissonant melodies, meditating on
the realization that "Time has frit-
tered long and slow /All (he is) and
was will go."
Unfortunately, those momentsof
brilliance are few and far between.
More often than not, Morrissey
crafts songs that incorporate all of
the elements that his fans adore,
but in a watered-down, incoher-
ent form that stands in stark con-
trast with the singer's finest work.
The title track, a '60s protest song-
inspired ballad, is the mostblatant-
ly political song on the album and
also one of the most clunky and dis-
jointed, with Morrissey cobbling
together a smattering of vaguely
99-percenter sentiments without
taking any particular stance on
the subject. A number of his lyr-
ics are simply indecipherable, like
the jumbled rhymes ("Babies full
of rabies / Rabies full of scabies" or

Young director's small

too, because the

rooted family
angst - however Hellion
removed from
the viewer's own IFC Films
life - almost Michigan Theater
always touches
an easy nerve.
"Hellion," Kat
Candler's indie Sundance debut'-
opens in a typical rural Texas
town during a high school foot-
ball game as Jacob Wilson (Josh
Wiggins) and his group of friends
destroy a car outside the stadium.
Amid a barrage of heavy metal, the
frantic cuts between the mania of
the game and fans and the boys
as they smash the car hint at the,
underlying anarchic impulses that
small towns rein in through com-
munity institutions like football
and its adjoining fandom.
But what happens when a per-
son doesn't grow up with these
institutions, existing in the impov-
erished periphery? Jacob Wilson
shows it isn't pretty. Through an
unsteady, handheld gaze, the cam-

era follows Jacob as he ends up in
a court-ordered juvenile facility
during the day, followed by unsu-
pervised dirt-biking and assorted
acts of delinquency in the evening,
the latter tinged with an almost
nostalgic "Sandlot"glow. However,
"Hellion" is quick to establish that
Jacob deviates far from the senti-
mental boys-will-be-boys notion
entrenched'in the myth of Texan
childhood. For the first third of
the movie we can only guess at the
source of this angst, as the narra-
tive structure isn't in a hurry to
explain a lot of the crucial details.
What's absent in plot backbone is
fleshed out by Josh Wiggins, whose
smoldering James Dean-like per-
formance wonderfully conveys
the messy knot of fear and sadness
that directs his actions. Even if it
takes a distracting amount of time
to discover why he is so angry, the
emotional truth and intensity of
Wiggins' performance draws focus
from the shaky background details.
Audiences will easily love the
impossibly cute Deke Garner as
Jacob's little brother, Wes, but the
real force comes from the conflict-
ing influence Jacob has on him. He
both shields Wes and inexplicably
draws him into his world, making
their eventual separation all the
more heart wrenching. Parental
neglect and tragedy have ingrained
Wes with an extreme passivity
that's uncomfortable to watch, the
foil to Jacob's stormy turbulence.
Being introduced to the two sib-
lings first also makes their alco-
holic father Hollis (Aaron Paul,

"Breaking Bad") much harder
to redeem, which makes the film
stronger.
"Hellion" doesn't aim for neat
resolutions: the characters are all
flawed (except for maybe Wes).
Since the weight of the film comes
from the intimate, messy psycho-
logical character studies carried
by a talented cast, the various sub-
plots feel flimsy, especially with
Hollis. His original sin, which
fundamentally ruptures the fam-
ily, is never explored, and details
such as a house in Galveston and
his prior career as a baseball
player are trotted out but never
expanded upon.
Same with his strained rela-
tionship with sister Pam (Juliette
Lewis), who steps in as a surrogate
mother for Wes after an ill-timed
CPA visit: her role adds tension,
as an audience we rationally know
she's the better caretaker for acqui-
escent Wes, but emotionally we
feel Hollis's fury and paternal loss.
Despite all of this, the final
third of the film, which escalates
the plot, works. It's contrived
and dramatic, and too neatly
foreshadowed, but it whittles
the action into a razor-sharp
point that's unyielding and just
awesome. The last minutes are
ambiguous and unsatisfying in
the best way possible. Negating
some of the drama from the cli-
max, they manage to strike the
right chord between the tonal
grittiness of the movie and the
audience desire - or by this point,
need - for some shard of hope.

Original Street Art
Fair hosts event to
say 'thank you' to
city residents
By SHOHAM GEVA
ManagingNews Editor
Monday, two days before the
Art Fair hit downtown Ann Arbor,
the organizers of the Original Ann
Arbor Street Art Fair held a party.
The Original Street Art Fair is
one of four fairs that make up the
full event.
Mostly devoid of the attributes
familiar to Art Fair attendees -
the only art that's sold is from kids
in the area during the Kids' Art
Fair, bands play and booths are
filled primarily by local businesses
and community organizations -
the Townie Street Party is also a
noticeably smaller event than the
hundreds of thousands of visitors
that flood the streets of Ann Arbor
for the actual fair.
In fact, in contrast to the actual
fair, it doesn't really attract people
from out of town at all. Instead, it's
primarily attended by Ann Arbor
residents.
Ann Arbor resident Derek
Davis, who attended this year's
Townie Street Party, said connect-
ing with other residents is one of
the highlights of the event.
"Just to see other residents, it's
cool to kind of see people that you
know from around town," he said.
"And the outside environment's

kind of neat, good music. It's very
Ann Arbor."
Ann Arbor residents Adrian
Cleypool and Gus Gustafon echoed
Davis's sentiment.
"The music, and seeingmore old
Ann Arborites - it works for that
especially well," Cleypool said.
Maureen Riley, Ann Arbor
Street Fair executive director, said
the event was started withthe goal
of strengthening bonds between
the community and the fair.
"It's an event that we put on to
involve residents in the prepara-
tions and fun of the Art Fair, and
to say 'thank you'," she said. "We
certainly know that Art Fair can
be an inconvenience to many that
work in the downtown area, and
we appreciate their willingness to
accommodate us and understand
the value of the Art Fair to the.city
and the economic impact we have
on our community."
Though the Townie Street Party
is only 10 years old to the fair's 54
years, that theme of strengthen-
ing community relations has long
been a defining factor of the city
and fair's relationship, as the two
figure out how to balance an event
that now draws roughly 500,000
people into the area, multiplying
Ann Arbor's population almost by
six as well as shutting down sig-
nificant portions of the downtown
area.
City Councilmember Christo-
pher Taylor (D-Ward 3) said the
fair is without a doubt an impor-
tant Ann Arbor event.
"The Art Fair brings millions

of dollars, and hundreds of thou-
sands of people," Taylor said. "It is
a self-evident good for the econo-
my and the cultural vitality of the
city."
Taylor, along with City Coun-
cilmember Jane Lumm (I-Ward
2) sponsored a measure this year
to allocate $10,000 to the Original
Street Art Fair in the fiscal year
2015 city budget.
He added that while a large pro-
portion of attendees are from out
of town, he thinks residents also
enjoy the fair.
"I think numbers demonstrate
that a lot of people come in from
out of town, and I think that's
great," he said. "I also think people
in Ann Arbor tend to like the Art
Fair. It's exciting, its vibrant - I'm
not sure that everybody loves all
the Art Fair all the time. I think
the residents of Ann Arbor value
the events and they like to take
part in the city and like to show
visitors what we have to offer."
Riley said when it comes to ben-
efits for the city, along with the
about $80 million in economic
impact it brings, the fair also plays
a big part in quality of life in the
area.
"Almost every ranking that
comes out that puts Ann Arbor as
a great place to live almost inevi-
tably mentions the Art Fair as one
of the reasons," she said. "The arts
and culture in this community
are one of the major factors in the
quality of life here."

Food at Art Fair
By Giancarlo Buonomo

I

I'm tempted to begin this article with
some passionate argument for the
consideration of food as art, but you're
in for such an overload of art this week
that I'll spare you. But there are a few
things that won't spare you: the sun,
the pavement, the miles of walking
and talking and bartering. You're going
to get tired, hungry, thirsty and in need
of a break. So without further ado, let
me show you how to refuel and rest
during a typical day at Art Fair.
Breakfast
It'll do you good to have a hearty
first meal and get your energy up.
For classic breakfast fare, your best
bet is Angelo's, located at 1100 East
Catherine, in Kerrytown. Angelo's is
a favorite amongst both students and
townies for their upscale diner-style
breakfasts with an eclectic twist. Some
lauded dishes include cinnamon-raisin
pancakes, Portabello Benedict, and
corned-beef hash - all served with
homemade bread.
If you're more of a coffee-and-a-
pastry type, then you should check out
Espresso Royale, which has locations
on both South University and State
Street.
Lunch
Arts Fair is just once a year, and that
means that the Arts Fair food vendors
are only here once a year. This year,
food stands will be set up on the lawns
of both the Michigan Union and the
Michigan League, and you should defi-
nitely check them out for a quick lunch
while browsing.
At the Union, vendors will include:
Greek Tavern, Gosia's Pierogies,
Chesapeake Diversified Goof, Don-
nie's BBQ, and Wild Bill's Olde Fash-
ioned Root beer, among others.
At the League, vendors will include
Eskimo Jack's, Achatz Homemade
Pie's and Greek Flame.
However, if you're in the mood for an
Ann Arbor institution, you should defi-

nitely check out Zingerman's Delica-
tessen. Considered the most popular
restaurant in Ann Arbor, this Kerry-
town deli is famous for it's sandwiches
on homemade bread - so famous,
in fact, that some guy named Barack
chose to eat there when he visited Ann
Arbor in the spring.
Dinner
Okay, I'll make one connection
between food and art. At Art Fair,
you'll be seeing a pretty spectacular
diversity of art, in all mediums, genres
and cultural heritages. It makes sense,
then, that at night you indulge in some
of the diversity that the Ann Arbor
restaurant scene has to offer.
Voted the best burger in Ann Arbor,
Frita Batidos is an homage to Cuban
street food. The "frita" is a patty, made
of ground beef or chorizo, topped with
anything from shoestring fries to avo-
cado spread and sandwiched in an
egg bun. The "batidos" are tropical
milkshakes made with coconut or pas-
sion fruit, and can even be made with
a splash of dark rum.
For Mexican, try Isalita, located at
341 East Liberty. Voted the best new
restaurant in Ann Arbor, this inventive
eatery offers small plate delicacies like
smoked mahi mahi tostadas, truffled
guacamole, and braised lamb tacos.
Be sure to order a variety of dishes to
share with everyone.
If you want something a bit lighter,
try the always popular Sadako. This
South University Japanese restaurant
has staked out its claim as the favored
sushi joint in town for its afford-
able prices and diversity of offerings.
If sushi is your thing, then you can
sample everything from austere nigiri
of fatty tuna and sea urchin, to the
rococo inventions like the "U of M"
roll with tuna, salmon, cucumber and
avocado. If raw fish isn't your bag, fear
not: Sadako has everything from Udon
to teriyaki to Katsu.

e Shenouda
tween the South University Businessmen's Association and the Ann Ar-
bor Art Association. One thousand invitations were sent out, attracting
132 artists, 99 of whom were local. This year, the Art Fair anticipates
housing around 198 artists, 73 of whom have been invited back based
on their performances the previous year.
6. Originally, the registration fee for participating artists was $1. Now,
artists apply every year to be represented at the Art Fair, and a jury of
experts, utilizing media panels to create a fair of exceptional quality,
reviews applications.
7. The Art Fair's logo was initially a fish. This year, the logo depicts two
birds circling the Burton Tower, a prominent architectural feature on the
University's campus, which is accessible from many places during the
Art Fair.
8. In 1962, the State Street Area Association instituted a few rules for
their separate fair, including the mandate of "original, quality, creative
work" and that the artists must be present, but helpers were permis-
sible.
9. Art Fair T-shirts were introduced in the early 80s.
10. After quadrupling in size during its first four years, today the Art Fair
regularly sees more than 500,000 people annually.
