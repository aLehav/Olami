A2 protesters
decry U.S. rep.'s
treatment of lower,

By BETHANY BIRON
DailyNewsEditor
As House Majority Leader
Eric Cantor (R-Va.) took the
stage at the Michigan League

yesterday, a group of protesters
outside the building erupted
in chants of "Eric Cantor you
can't hide! Eric Cantor we're
outside!" that resonated inside
the room.
The group of about So pro-
testers demonstrated against
Cantor's visit to campus and
carried an array of tombstone-
shaped signs bearing phrases
such as "RIP Higher Educa-
tion" and "RIP Equal Rights."
Students and Ann Arbor resi-

dents criticized Cantor's politi-
cal views and his neglect of
lower-and middle-class issues.
Kicking off the protests was
a satirical speech by Rackham
student Joel Batterman, who
was dressed as Cantor in a blue
pin-striped suit and glasses and
who stood beside a tombstone
labeled "The Middle Class."
Batterman's speech mocking
Cantor's policies was met with
boisterous cheers from the
crowd, which was composed

of people from a variety of age
groups and racial backgrounds.
The group's chants, like
the popular "1-2-3-4, if you'
hungry, eat the poor. 5-6-7-8
you'll be next to fill our plate,"
continued throughout Cantor's
speech.
Some students took a more
festive route in their protests
and attended dressed as zom-
bies. Batterman, who is also

45 years ago this week
(Nov. 1, 1966): The Uni-
versity requested its largest
amount of state funding ever
as it announced a record-
high proposed budget for
the 1967-1968 school year.
The University asked for
$74.6 million from the state
- 28 percent more than the
$58 million the state Leg-
islature had granted the
University for the previous
schoolyear.The University's
total operating budget was
projected at $93.3 million.
At the time, 13 of the
University's 20 graduate
departments had declined
in national rankings. The

University hoped the
increased funds would pro-
vide a boost in quality of the
academic programs.
30 years ago this week
(Nov. 1, 1981): The Michi-
gan Student Assembly
urged students to write
letters to members of Con-
gress protesting a $562 mil-
lion reduction to federal
financial aid programs.
MSA representatives
handed out paper, enve-
lopes and stamps through-
out campus. Then-MSA
PresidentJon Feigersaid he
thought the initiative would
be effective since many
University students were

from states with influential
congressmen such as New
York and Illinois.
The proposals in Con-
gress included a decrease
in Pell Grant funding from
$2.65 billion to $2.37 billion,
excluding up to 600,000
students who were eligi-
ble for the funding. There
would also be fewer guar-
anteed loans for students
because bankers were
afraid of an increase in
defaults.
15 years ago this week
(November 1, 1996): MSA
sponsored a two-hour
debate for candidates run-
ning for a seat in the U.S.

House of Representatives.
Four candidates for
Michigan's 13th congres-
sional district debated in
the Michigan League's Van-
denberg Room. U.S. Rep
Lynn Rivers (D-Mich.) was
joined by candidates from
the Libertarian, Workers

ity parties.
Rivers expressed her sup-
port at the time for increas-
ingeducation funding.
"It's better to spend
$5,000 to educate a child
than $30,000 to incarcer-
ate him," Rivers said at the
debate.

Egyptians protest
arrest of blogger

Military arrest
blogger who
opposed Mubarak
CAIRO (AP)- More than 3,000
Egyptians marched through
downtown Cairo yesterday, pro-
testing the military's arrest of a
prominent blogger-activist in the
latest sign of discontent with the
ruling generals' managing of the
country.
The activist, Alaa Abdel-Fat-
tah, was ordered held by the mili-
tary a day earlier for questioning.
The military says he is suspected
of inciting Christian protesters to
attack soldiers during an Oct. 9
protest in Cairo that turned into
the bloodiest violence since the
February fall of President Hosni
Mubarak.
His supporters dismiss the
claim, sayingthemilitaryis trying
to silence a prominent critic and

to deflect blame on its soldiers in
the violence, which left 27 dead -
most of them Christians - when
troops cracked down on the pro-
test.
In yestserday evening's march,
the crowd shouted, "Down, down
with military rule" and "Alaa,
we're behind you, don't stop,"
as they moved into central Tah-
rir Square, then headed toward
Cairo's main police station, where
Abdel-Fattah is being held.
About 200 police formed a line
around the station. There were no
clashes.
Abdel-Fattah, who turns 30
in November, was Egypt's first
blogger activist, launching a blog
years agoorganizingoppositionto
Mubarak. Since Mubarak's Feb. 11
ouster following an 18-day upris-
ing, he has been a vocal critic of
the military's rule.
"Alaa is causing them trouble

so long.

Jury convicts man
in serial killer case

Killer faced 72
charges, including 9
counts of murder
PHOENIX (AP) - An Arizona
jury yesterday found a former con-
struction worker guilty of killing
nine people in the so-called Base-
line Killer case that terrorized the
Phoenix area during the summer
of 2006.
Mark Goudeau was accused
of attacking his victims as they
went about daily activities, such
as leaving work or washing their
car. He left most of them with
their pants unzipped and partially
pulled down. The victims - eight
of them women - ranged from 19
to 39 years old
Prosecutors had called the
47-year-old Goudeau a "ravenous

wolf" driven by a hunger to rape
women and kill those who didn't
cooperate with his demands.
Defense attorneys insisted that
there are likelier suspects than
Goudeau and questioned DNA
tests linking Goudeau to the
crimes.
In all, Goudeau faced 72 counts,
including the nine murders and
various counts of kidnapping, sex-
ual assault and robbery. He was
found guilty of all but four counts,
and the jury failed to reach a ver-
dict on one charge.
"Hopefully there's going to be
some closure in my mind now,"
said Alvin Hogue, 53, whose wife
was killed with another woman
as they cooked food inside a lunch
truck in Phoenix. His wife left
behind Hogue and six children
altogether, including their then
4-month-old twin boys.

Agency had been
connected to
criminal activity
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -
President Juan Manuel Santos
dissolved Colombia's scandal-
plagued DAS domestic intelli-
gence agency yesterday, saying its
employees will be transferred to
other state offices.
He had already announced
that the agencywould be replaced
by a new entity.
The agency was caught spy-
ing on presidential foes includ-
ing judges, reporters and human
rights activists during the 2002-
2010 administration of San-
tos' predecessor, Alvaro Uribe,
Washington's closest ally in the
region at the time.
Some DAS agents and officials
also colluded with extreme-right
militias that killed and displaced
thousands and persecuted labor
activists.

Uribe's first DAS chief, Jorge
Noguera, was convicted last
month of murder in the 2004
death squad killing of a left-wing
university professor.
A later DAS director, Maria del
Pilar Hurtado, obtained political
asylum in Panama with Uribe's
help to avoid a fate similar to
Uribe's former chief of staff, Ber-
nardo Moreno.
Moreno was jailed in July
pending trial on criminal con-
spiracy charges for allegedly
ordering illegal espionage. He
says he is innocent.
About half the 6,000 DAS
employees will go to the chief
prosecutor's office, where many
investigators will join the CTI
investigators' corps. Others are
being shifted to the national
police and government minis-
tries.
"A lot of people in the DAS
have been stigmatized, unjustly
I would say," Santos told report-
ers, speaking with current DAS
director Felipe Munoz at his side.

"So many law-abiding people
shouldn't pay for a few sinners."
Munoz said 92 percent of the
agency's employees will retain
government jobs, and the agency's
liquidation will take until Dec. 31.
He said Santos would announce
the creation of a new intelligence
agency later this week.
Neither he nor the president,
who did not take questions,
explained how they would pre-
vent DAS employees who might
have been involved in illegal
activites from being incorporated
in the new agency.
It was not immediately clear,
either, how much U.S. assistance
the new agency might receive.
Before the scandal, the DAS
received some U.S. training and
equipment, including a unit that
worked closely with the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion. U.S. government officials
say the agency's use of that aid
was closely monitored to prevent
abuses.
The scandal broke in Febru-

ary2009 afterthe newsmagazine
Semana revealed the illegal spy-
ing on promiment Uribe foes. At
least 20 current and former DAS
officials have been jailed.
Two senior agency officials
cooperated with prosecutors and
have received eight-year prison
sentences in return.
The DAS has been a multi-fac-
eted agency, with responsibilities -
that encompassed not just intelli-
gence work against criminals and
leftist rebels but also protecting
Colombia's borders and handling
migration matters.
The latter responsibilities will
now be transferred to the Foreign
Ministry.
In previous administrations,
the DAS was an important tool
in the government's fight against
drug traffickers.
In December 1989, a car bomb
attack ordered by the late cocaine
kingpin Pablo Escobar ripped
open the agency's Bogota head-
quarters, killing more than SO
people.

Fraternity fires

$33M Mexican
drug ring busted
Arizona authorities have dis-

more than $33 million worth of
drugs through the state's western
desert every month for distribu-
tion nationwide, officials said yes-

The ring is believed be tied
to the Sinaloa cartel - Mexico's
most powerful - and responsible
for smuggling more than 3.3 mil-
lion pounds of marijuana, 20,000
pounds of cocaine and 10,000
pounds of heroin into the U.S.
through Arizona over the past five
years, according to U.S. Immigra-

Their efforts in that time gen-

22 suspected smugglers tied to
the ring on Thursday, the latest of

it down following a 17-month
investigation dubbed "Operation

St. Paul's leaders
split in decision to
evict protesters
LONDON (AP) - The Dean
of St. Paul's Cathedral quit yes-
terday, the second high-profile
clergy member to step down
over anti-capitalist protests that
have spilled across the historic
church's grounds.
The resignation of Graeme
Knowles leaves the cathedral
without a leader and will delay
its planned legal action to evict
the protest camp - though the
neighborhood's governing body
says it will formally ask the pro-
testers today to leave, and will
go to court if they refuse.
Knowles said his position had
become "untenable" as criticism
of the cathedral mounted in
the press and in public opinion.
Knowles had urged protesters to
leave the cathedral area to allow
it to reopen its doors.
Officials shut the church to
the public on Oct. 21, saying
demonstrators' tents were a
health and safety hazard. It was
the first time the 300-year-old
London church had closed since
German planes bombed the city
during World War II. After a
public outcry, it reopened Friday.
Knowles' resignation follows
that last week of Giles Fraser, a
senior St. Paul's Cathedral priest
who had welcomed the anti-
capitalist demonstrators to set
up camp outside the landmark,
inspired by New York's Occupy
Wall Street movement. He said
he resigned because he feared
moves to evict the protesters
could end in violence.
A part-time chaplain, Fraser

Dyer, also resigned last week,
saying he was "embarrassed" by
the decision to take legal action
to try to evict the protesters.
Senior clergy have been
divided over how to handle the
scores of tents set up outside
the iconic cathedral near the
River Thames in central Lon-
don. Demonstrators erected the
tents Oct. 15, during a thwarted
attempt to stage a protest out-
side the nearby London Stock
Exchange.
The protesters said Knowles'
resignation showed that the
management of St. Paul's is
"obviously deeply divided" over
the protests. But in a statement
on the Occupy London website,
the movement said it had never
called for any "scalps" from the
clergy.
"Our cause has never been
directed at the staff of the cathe-
dral," the group said. It called
for an "open and transparent
dialogue" between demonstra-
tors and those urging campers
to move.
Knowles, 60, called the past
two weeks a "testing time" and
said his decision to step down
did not come easily.
"Since the arrival of the pro-
testers' camp outside the cathe-
dral, we have all been put under
a great deal of strain and have
faced what would appear to be
some insurmountable issues,"
he said in a statement. "I hope
and pray that under new leader-
ship these issues might continue
to be addressed and that there
might be a swift and peaceful
resolution."
St. Paul's officials said
Knowles made his decision
known on Sunday night and has
already removed himself from

operations.
On Sunday, clergymen and
demonstrators held talks aimed
at avoiding a violent confronta-
tion over the camp.
Both the church and the local
authority, the City of London
Corporation, announced last
week they were going to court
to clear scores of tents from a
pedestrianized square and foot-
path outside the cathedral.
But cathedral spokesman Rob
Marshall said legal proceed-
ings had not yet started, and
the governing chapter "is now
discussing a range of options in
the wake of the resignation of
the dean."
Knowles' resignation does
not affect the separate legal
action by the City of London
Corporation, which is seeking
eviction on the grounds that the
protest is an "unreasonable user
of the highway."
It said it would issue aletter to
the protesters on Tuesday ask-
ing them to remove their tents.
If they refuse, the Corporation
will go to court in a bid to get
an injunction to clear the camp.
Many expect the legal process
to be lengthy and complex.
Archbishop of Canterbury
Rowan Williams, leader of
the Anglican church, called
Knowles' decision to step down
"very sad news."
"The events of the last cou-
ple of weeks have shown very
clearly how decisions made
in good faith by good people
under unusual pressure can
have utterly unforeseen and
unwelcome consequences, and
the clergy of St. Paul's deserve
our understanding in these cir-
cumstances," he said in a state-
ment.

U.S. responds with
refusal to make $60
million payment
PARIS (AP) - Palestine won its
greatest international endorse-
ment yet yesterday, full member-
ship in UNESCO, but the move
will cost the agency one-fifth of
its funding and some fear will
send Mideast peace efforts off a
cliff.
In an unusually dramatic ses-
sion at the Paris-based United
Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization, there
were cheers for "yes" votes and
grumbles for the "no's" and
abstentions. When the results
were in, many delegates jumped
to their feet and applauded and
someone let out a cry ofLonglive
Palestine!" in French.
"Joy fills my heart. This is real-
ly a historic moment," said Pal-
estinian Foreign Minister Riad
Malki. "It's the return of he who
was banished."
But the jubilation was quickly
pierced by reality: The United
States said it wouldn't make a $60
million payment to fill out its con-
tributions for this year and would
suspend all future funding.
UNESCO depends heavily on
that money - Washington pro-
vides 22 percent of its budget -
but has survived without it in the
past: The United States pulled
out of UNESCO under President
Ronald Reagan, rejoining two
decades later under President
George W. Bush.
Yesterday's vote was a grand
symbolic victory for the Pales-
tinians, but it alone won't make
Palestine a state. The issues of
borders for an eventual Palestin-
ian state, security, a solution for
Palestinian refugees, the fate of
Jerusalem and other disputes that
have thwarted Middle East peace
for decades remain unresolved.
Some argued it would even make
it harder for the Palestinians to
reach their goal.
White House spokesman Jay
Carney called UNESCO's deci-
sion "premature" and said it
undermines the international
community's efforts toward
a comprehensive Middle East
peace plan. He called it a distrac-
tion from the goal of restarting
direct negotiations between Isra-
el and the Palestinians.
Israeli Ambassador Nimrod
Barkan said the decision did "a
great disservice to international
law and to chances for peace."
"UNESCO deals in science,
not science fiction," he said in
a speech to delegates after the
vote. "However, a large number
of member states, though most
emphatically less than two-thirds
of the member states of this orga-

nization, have adopted a science
fiction version of reality."
His government said it was
reconsidering its cooperation
with UNESCO.
The request to grant Palestine
full membership passed 107-14,
with 52 abstentions. Eighty-one
votes were needed for approval
- or two-thirds of the 173 eli-
gible member delegations pres-
ent. There are now 195 members
in al.
In a surprise, France voted
"yes" - and the room erupted in
cheers. It was joined by Ireland,
Austria and the Arab states. The
"no" votes included the United
States, Israel, Sweden, the Neth-
erlands and Germany, while
many American allies abstained,
including Japan, Britain and New
Zealand.
Yesterday's vote is definitive,
and the membership formally
takes effect when Palestine signs
UNESCO's founding charter.
It is part of a broader Palestin-
ian quest for greater international
recognition in hopes of moving
closer to statehood through chan-
nels other than simply negotia-
tions with Israel.
There, however, are concerns
that strategy could backfire.
Before the vote, Israel's outspoken
foreign minister, Avigdor Lieber-
man, said that if the measure
passed, Israel should cut off ties
with the Palestinian Authority.
It was not clear whether he was
voicing government policy.
By contrast, Malki said he
hoped the vote would only pro-
vide momentum for the Palestin-
ians' quest for statehood. But he
added that it was no substitute
for the Palestinians' more high-
profile request for admission to
the United Nations.
The Obama administration
has vowed to use its veto power
in the Security Council to quash
Palestinian membership in the
broade'.N., but hadbeedhop-
ing it wouldn't come to that since
wielding its veto could under-
mine the United States' typically
pivotal role as negotiator between
Israel and the Palestinians.
However, Malki, indicated
Monday that he thought he had
enough support to win a Security
Council vote, which has not yet
been scheduled.
UNESCO, like many U.N.
agencies, is a part of the world
body but has separate member-
ship procedures and can make
its own decisions about which
countries belong. The disconnect
between memberships is rare
but not unprecedented. Two tiny
Pacific island nations - the Cook
Islands and Niue - are members
of UNESCO but not the U.N.,
while Liechtenstein belongs to
the larger world body but not the
cultural agency.

Less talk, more action
Cantor's speech offered few realistic solutions
alloween took on a more political angle this year at the Uni-
versity when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor spoke at
the Michigan League yesterday afternoon. Cantor's speech
drew a large crowd of University students and Ann Arbor community
members, including an array of protesters. While Cantor's message
lauding personal prosperity and small government is nice in princi-
ple, he should remember that actions speak louder than words. The
nation's unemployed, poor and disappearing middle class need tan-
gible help in the form of job creation and social welfare legislation
now - not in Cantor's idealized vision of the future.

More to the 'Occupy' story

couple of weeks ago, dur-
ing a weekend jaunt to New
York City, a friend and I
went downtown

to experience
firsthand the
Occupy Wall
Street protests.
We knew that a
march to Times
Square was
scheduled for
that afternoon,
and our curiosity
and our politics

MATTHEW
GREEN

beckoned us to
go. After finding the protesters, the
two of us stood with our cameras at
the ready, as if we were watching a
Thanksgiving Day parade. Suffi-
ciently neurotic from our mothers'
insistence that we'd get arrested if
we took part, we had planned only
to watch from the curb. But within
moments of arriving we were shout-
ing chants and marching alongside
two women carrying a United Auto
Workers banner. The vitality of the
protest had captivated us.
As we marched through lower
Manhattan that afternoon, I looked
at the protesters around me. The
diversity of the crowd was readily
apparent. I was expecting - from
what I'd seen in the media - a set of
undergraduate hipsters and burned
out, homeless hippies. And surely
those groups were present that day
in the streets. But just beside us, the
women carrying the union banner
were middle-aged and likely middle
class - as were so many of the oth-
ers in our midst. There were nuclear
families and cantankerous old ladies
and clergymen and kids. Though
many seemed "fringe," as I had sus-
pected, equally many did not. People
wore suits and scrubs and yarmul-
kes too. And I noticed in the throngs
of protesters a significant number
of African Americans, Latinos and
Asians.
This was notthe image of OWS I'd
seen portrayed in the news. While

the media have pigeonholed the
protesters as radical beatniks clash-
ing with the American mainstream,
the picture on the ground seemed
a relatively representative array of
U.S. demographics: racial, cultural
and socioeconomic. When it comes
to the media's coverage of the occu-
py movement, we have to take each
account with more than a few grains
of salt. Not only is the media prone to
repeating classic cliches, but in many
cases, their commentary is evidently
guessing as much as anything else.
Particularly now, everyone's spec-
ulating about the potential political
and cultural effects (or lack thereof)
of OWS. At just a couple of months
in, no one can really say what these
effects will be. In the media, pundits
debate the movement's successes or
failures based on whatever is politi-
cally provocative or shrewd in that
moment. There's no single, obvious
barometer for measuring the success
of OWS, as much as the media would
like there to be.
Though I realize I'm entering
dangerous waters making the fol-
lowing historical comparison, I
think there's a worthwhile lesson in
the history of the American Com-
munist and Socialist parties. One
can surely make the case that these
two tiny parties were inconsequen-
tial in our grander political history,
never having won any major elec-
tions and leaving no real legacy for
our contemporary political dialogue.
(Although you may be surprised to
hear that the Socialists at one point
did elect two U.S. congressmen).
From an electoral standpoint,
these two parties were largely fail-
ures. But one could also contend that
after these two parties first orga-
nized in the U.S., the Democratic
Party became increasingly liberal
in an attempt to appeal to would-be
Socialists or Communists. And in so
doing,the Democrats built our social
safety net with the New Deal. In that
case, arguably, these two third par-
ties were great successes.

In much the same way, judg-
ing the legacy of the Occupy move-
ment will depend primarily on one's
choice of yardstick. For now it's still
too early to speculate what about the
movement will be successful, but its
sustained momentum suggests that
something lastingwill come from it.
Media should
depict OWS
truthfully.

I
4

What is beyond speculation, how-
ever, is the ever-widening chasm
between rich and poor in the U.S.
Factual evidence of deepening
inequality has been trickling in
over the past few years. Those who
accuse the OWS protesters of wag-
ing class warfare neglect to see the
ways in which deregulation and a
porous social safety net have already
damaged American society. Class
warfare? A rose by any other name,
be it neoliberal or trickle-down,
would smell as sweet.
I suspect that a great deal more
Americans would get behind the
Occupy movement if only the media .
did a fairer, more accurate job of
covering the protests. A recent Gal-
lup poll suggested that 63 percent of
Americans aren't aware that one of
OWS's primary objectives is to com-
bat income inequality.
My hope is that this movement
influences our political discourse
even if it's in ways that aren't so eas-
ily definable or obvious. But in order
to get there, we need to recognize
that the media only offer us part of
the story. Because another world is
only possible once people hear the
truth.

Cantor spoke yesterday for about half an
hour and followed the speech with a ques-
tion-and-answer period. Focusing much
of his speech on what he defined as "core
American economic principles," Cantor
spoke of the importance of creating a level-
playing field and establishing a strong mid-
die class.
Cantor argued that Washington should
give Americans a "hand up" and not a "hand-
out." Though he repeatedly emphasized these
phrases, Cantor failed to explain what hand
ups actually entail or what types of benefits
they provide. Cantor tried to shed a positive
light on his conservative policies, but little of
what he discussed was tangible, realistic or
advantageous for students.
Though his goal of creating an environment
that encourages entrepreneurship is ideal,
now is not the time for the government to stop
assisting those who need help most. Cantor
spoke of the importance of giving lower-class
Americans the chance to "climb the ladder,"
yet he supports cutting Pell Grants, unem-
ployment benefits and health care assistance
to lower income Americans.
A student in attendance spoke about how
he had lost a Pell Grant and asked Cantor how
he could support the elimination of a financial
resource so beneficial to students. Cantor sim-
plyavoided answeringthe questionbyvaguely
arguing thathigher education is too expensive
and failed to give substantial ideas on how to
lower costs.
University seniors will most likely enter the
job market in six months with the national

unemployment rate near 9 percent. Yet Can-
tor has failed to get a job creation bill through
Congress. In many recent speeches, including
yesterday's, Cantor has discussed his version
of a jobs plan - the Steve Jobs plan. The basis
of the plan is to promote upward mobility of
all Americans and to not punish those who
have succeeded in making their way up the
"ladder," he said. The plan also has the goal
of encouraging entrepreneurship and innova-
tion. These are all positive goals, but the plan
fails to account for young people and unem-
ployed Americans who need immediate assis-
tance, not buzzwords.
Among attendees of Cantor's speech were
protesters wielding signs that read "RIP Mid-
dle Class" and students dressed as zombies.
Protesters were extremely vocal, and there
were times throughout Cantor's question-
and-answer period when they did not allow
him to respond to questions by interrupting
his answers or turned their backs to him.
The University prides itself on fostering an
environment that respects diversity, which
should include diversity of ideas. While stu-
dents should certainly voice their opinions
and speak out for causes they believe in, they
should remain respectful of visiting speakers
and use the event as an opportunity to engage
in meaningful discussions.
Cantor's speech, though controversial, fos-
tered important conversations on campus and
showed that students are passionate about the
future of the nation. Cantor needs to recognize
the importance of securing this future and take
meaningful action to do so.

DAN BURNS!
Give employee benefits fairly

The University of Michigan chapter of the
American Association of University Profes-
sors strongly opposes Michigan HB 4770 and
HB 4771- the bills before the Michigan Leg-
islature seeking to prohibit state employers,
including Michigan's public colleges and uni-
versities, from offering employees benefits
for domestic partners and even eliminating
that as a possible topic of collective bargain-
ing for units in which state employees are
unionized.
Faculty are widely in agreement that this
is fundamentally an issue of fairness for the
employees concerned and thatthe University
and the state, as employers, should not dis-
criminate against any class of their employ-
ees nor prevent employees from enjoying
the full fruits of their labors in equal mea-
sure to their contributions. We stand by all
our colleagues in the faculty and staff in
their rightful entitlement to the full respect
and compensation which is offered to their
peers. We deplore the continuing attempt
to roll back the rights of faculty and staff to
collective bargaining or to limit the scope of
bargaining by fiat. A free people should not
accept such disregard for their right to bar-
gain over the conditions of their employment.
In addition to this fundamental reason
for our opposition, we feel that the proposed
measures seriously compromise the con-
stitutional autonomy of Michigan's three
main universities and expect this to surface
in legal challenges, where the merits of this
autonomy will be weighed against those of
the ballot initiative Michigan State Proposal
04-2 of 2004, the legal basis for the chal-
lenges to domestic partner benefits. We feel
the wording of Prop 04-2 was disingenuous
and even misleading, and that the initiative's
proposers changed their stated interpreta-
tion very shortly after the measure passed
to cover denial of unmarried co-resident
benefits. We hope that this amendment, as
applied to employee compensation, will fail

in large measure under court challenges. We
are encouraged in this by legal challenges
already making headway against the state's
anti-affirmative action initiative of 2006.
Insofar as faculty compensation gets inter-
twined with federal research support, fed-
eral non-discrimination norms will have to
be squared away with Michigan practice, and
it seems unlikely that HB 4770 and HB 4771
will pass such review in that context.
We back the University in its claim that
national trends in employee benefit pack-
ages make unmarried co-resident benefits an
important component of compensation pack-
ages for faculty and staff recruitment. As
those responsible for the academic quality of
our future faculty colleagues, current faculty
stand firmly in support of keeping our insti-
tution competitive nationally. The state of
Michigan is not in any position of economic
strength whereby it can shrug off its need to
remain competitive in those areas, like high-
er education, which will prove essential for
its renaissance.
The fundamental reason we oppose HB
4770 and HB 4771 is basic fairness and
respect for all our faculty and staff col-
leagues. We call upon Michigan residents
to demand that of the Legislature. Forms
for writing to your representative and other
state officials are available on the web site
of the Michigan Conference of the AAUP:
http://www.miaaup.org.
Finally, we encourage all faculty read-
ers who are sympathetic with this cause, or
the others for which we stand, to join the
AAUP and strengthen our voice in this and
future debates: http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/
involved/join.
Let us unite in support of all our faculty,
staff and friends targeted by these legislative
initiatives?
Dan Burns is the interim president of the
University of Michigan AAUP chapter.

I participated in an abortion debate held by the
Michigan Political Union last Monday. Several times
throughout the event, students raised concern about
the impact of abortion bans on the poor. Legalizing
abortion, they argued, not only spares children from
suffering in dire poverty, but can also empower women
to break through the poverty cycle.
The impoverished conditions, under which the
majority of the world's population lives, are truly
appalling. However, I believe the suggestion that
legalizing abortion should play a part in reducing pov-
erty is gravely flawed for two reasons. First, it is inap-
propriate to solve societal problems by eliminating
the people affected. We don't fight malaria by killing
those with malarial infections. Similarly, we shouldn't
fight poverty by aborting the poor. Secondly, there is
no evidence that legalizing abortion helps women
break through poverty. True women's empowerment
requires education, material resources and personal
support - not abortion.
One reason given for legalizing abortion in under-
developed countries is that abortion spares children
from a life of poverty and suffering. Easing suffering is
a commendable goal, and one that I share, but when the
desire to prevent suffering leads us to eliminate those
who will suffer, we commit a grave error.
Last summer, I visited Kenya and Uganda. There I
saw village after village of malnourished children. I
mention this because I want to make it clear that in
no way do I wish to trivialize the suffering of billions
of people. On the contrary, the severity and extent
of the extreme poverty those children live in over-
whelmed me. However, the fact that those children
suffer does not make their lives valueless. The suf-
fering they endure does not take away their worth as
human beings. It is not up to us, the privileged, to say
that children, who will be born into desperately poor
circumstances, simply shouldn't be born at all. Rather,
we have an obligation as privileged residents of a privi-
leged country, to share our blessings with those who
have less.
Those on both sides of the abortion debate must
do more to improve material conditions for the poor,
both in the United States and abroad. How we choose
to provide that support - through government aid,
non-profit organizations or cultivating personal rela-
tionships - is another matter. The point is we can't,
in good conscience, fight poverty by killing those who
will experience it.
Secondly, abortion advocates are misguided when
they insist that legalizing abortion empowers women.

Susan B. Anthony, leader of 19th century campaigns
for women's suffrage, writes: "When a man steals
to satisfy hunger, we may safely conclude that there
is something wrong in society - so when a woman
destroys the life of her unborn child, it is an evidence
that either by education or circumstances she has been
greatly wronged."
Anthony recognized that women seeking abortion
do not do so because they feel empowered. On the
contrary, they are often motivated by a sense of des-
peration. There is tragic irony in the fact that while
abortion rights advocates offer slogans of "choice," it is
often the case that women seek abortions because they
feel they have no alternative. Furthermore, before we
advocate for legal abortion overseas, we should exam-
ine whether abortion has improved conditions for the
poor in our own country.
Nearly four decades after Roe v. Wade legalized
abortion in the U.S., inequality is higher, not lower,
than it was in 1973. Look at Detroit, which has 14 abor-
tion clinics. Correlation is certainly not causation, yet
it is safe to say that access to legal abortion has not kept
Detroit women out of poverty. Legalizing abortion in
Kenya will not make Kenyan women less poor. Abor-
tion will not educate them or provide better hospitals
or income. These are the areas where we should focus
our efforts to empower women - education, maternal 4
and child health care, financial opportunities such as
microfinance, etc. Misplaced emphasis on legal abor-
tion for impoverished women distracts from the lack
of educational and material resources that drives them
to seek abortion in the first place.
The reality is that women want to bring their chil-
dren into a world where they can adequately care and
provide for them. Efforts to empower women should
target the lack of educational opportunities, material
resources and personal support that lead women to
feel that they cannot bring that child into the world
- the reasons women seek abortion in the first place.
Let's work together in a genuine creative effort to find
real, workable solutions to poverty, but not by aborting
the children of the poor.
On Wednesday, Nov. 9 three women who chose
abortion will be speaking about this experience and
its effect on them to the campus community. It will be
in the Henderson Room of the Michigan League at 7
p.m. with a question-and-answer period to follow the
speakers. I would encourage anyone who is interested
to attend.

CANTOR
From Page 1A
in U.S. history, social mobility
has been possible but depends
on the willingness of the disad-
vantaged to sacrifice in order to
achieve the American dream.
Their values of ingenuity, hard
work and risk taking - on
which the country was found-
ed - should determine how far
Americans could advance up and
down the socioeconomic ladder,
he said.
"Instead of talking about
their fair share or spending time
trying to push those at the top
down, elected leaders in Wash-
ington should be trying to ensure
that everyone has a fair shot and
the opportunity to earn success
up the ladder," Cantor said. "The
goal shouldn't be to meet in the
middle of the ladder. We should
want all people to move up and
no one to be pulled down."
As part of rendering that
opportunity universally acces-
sible, Cantor praised small busi-
nesses as important job creators
for the economy.
"Small businessmen and
women are the key formula
for success and opportunity in
America," Cantor said. "They
may employ just a few people,
but each one of these individu-
als is able to start building a
better life for their families just
because one person took a risk."
In light of this summer's
debt ceiling debate that pushed
the federal government within
hours of defaulting on its debt,
Cantor also discussed partisan
gridlock within Washington.
In his speech yesterday, Can-
tor expressed hope that Republi-
cans and Democrats are capable
of finding some kind of a middle
ground on issues like the fed-

eral debt. But in an exclusive
interview with The Michigan
Daily after his speech, Cantor
said Obama and Congressional
Democrats have not cooperated
in attempting to solve the issues.
"Our side, as Republicans, we
said, 'Let's fix the problems. Let
just do it,' "Cantor said. "And we
put outa budget that was excori-
ated by the other side ... At least
we put out a plan. We are asking
for the president to counter that
proposition. Never has he done
(that) or anyone in his party."
Cantor added in the interview
that the decision to cut some
student loan programs as part of
the deficit deal - a decision he
advocated for but Obama pushed
back against - was not a pri-
mary concern since loans aren't
solving the larger problem of the
high cost of attending college.
"The underlying issue is that
higher education is too expen-
sive," Cantor said. "We've got
to figure out ways to reduce the
cost."
Mixed responses followed
Cantor's speech, which was
attended by 250 people, includ-
ing University President Mary
Sue Coleman, Public Policy
School Dean Susan Collins,
state Rep. Mark Ouimet (R-Scio
Township.) and City Council
member Stephen Rapundalo (D-
Ward 2).
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after the speech,
Coleman said she appreci-
ated Cantor coming to cam-
pus, regardless of the views he
expressed or the negative reac-
tion of some on campus.
"I thought it was a very good
opportunity for him to come,
and really talk to the University
community about his vision and
how he sees the issues of the
country and what he sees as the
solutions," Coleman said.

Business School junior Max
Heller said he enjoyed the
speech because of the stakes col-
lege students have in the topics
Cantor discussed.
"The speech was especially
relevant to members of our
generation because it was con-
cerning the topics of economic
opportunity, and for ... college
students such as ourselves, those
are important things to pay
attention to," Heller said.
In an interview after the
event, Ouimet said he valued the
presence of a Republican voice at
the University.
"It is always wonderful to get
different perspectives brought
to the University," he said.
Ouimet added that he sympa-
thizes with Cantor's position on
political gridlock, with funding
reductions at the federal and
state levels undercuttinguniver-
sity budgets.
"There isn't the resources that
there once were, so it's a contin-
ual balancing act on how do we
put all of this together," Ouimet
said. "And it's notan easy path ...
to success."
But others said they were less
enthused with the content of
the speech. LSA senior Amanda
Caldwell, chair of the Univer-
sity's chapter of College Demo-
crats, said Cantor stressed the
problems the country is facing
without offering any concrete
solutions.
"In theory, he was talking
about something I think every-
one should get behind, which
is leveling the playing field,"
Caldwell said. "But then, in
practice, he really wasn't putting
forth anything substantive that
would do so."

GORDON
From Page 1A
as MSA president. Shirvell was
also temporarily banned from
campus last fall after he report-
edly stalked Armstrong.
Shirvell was fired from his
position last year for lying dur-
ing a disciplinary conference,
using his resources in the attor-
ney general's office for non-work
related purposes and "harassing
conduct," then-Michigan Attor-
ney General Mike Cox wrote in a
statement at the time.
Shirvell said he believes that
Gordon knew Michael Ondejko,
the attorney general investiga-
tor on Shirvell's case, when he
still held his position with the
state. Shirvell claims that Gor-
don deliberately gave informa-
tion to Ondejko about Shirvell's
previous experience in a case
regarding a Michigan State Uni-
versity student.
"Ms. Gordon used her prior
relationship with the investiga-
tor Mike Ondejko to basically ...
get me fired," Shirvell said.
Gordon represented a former
MSU journalism director who
had dismissed a student Shirvell
also spoke out against, according
to Shirvell. Gordon, however,
said the claim is false. Though
she knew Ondejko from when he
served as a witness in a previous
case, she said she never engaged
in conversation with him about

Shirvell or the investigation he
was conducting.
"I never spoke to Mike Onde-
jko about Andrew Shirvell, at
any time," Gordon said. "I never'
spoke to anybodyfromthe attor-
ney general's office. None of that
ever happened - that's made
up."
Shirvell said Gordon's state-
ment that she never spoke to
Ondejko is a lie, and he believes
as his lawsuit continues, that
the lie will be revealed. Shirvell,
who will represent himself in
court, said he intends to receive
money from Gordon to compen-
sate for the economic damage he
has experienced since losing his
job. He estimates the compensa-
tion will be in the range of six to
seven figures.
Shirvell, who is currently
unemployed and living in New
York, said he believes Arm-
strong and Gordon have "tried
to destroy him in any way pos-
sible." Shirvell said he hopes to
tell his side of the story and fight
for his own justice by filing this
lawsuit.
"The one thing that they
can't take away from me is
my dignity," Shirvell said. "I
didn't commit wrong here. The
wrongdoers here are Deborah
Gordon and Chris Armstrong,
and their impact on my life in
the past year has been substan-
tial."
Gordon said the lawsuit
Shirvell filed against her will

not affect her representation of
Armstrong in his case against
Shirvell. Last week, the judge
presiding over Armstrong v.
Shirvell denied Shirvell's motion
to dismiss the claims against
him and advised Shirvell to seek
legal counsel as he was "too
emotional about the case."
Gordon added that she isn't
concerned about the lawsuit
against her, and she doesn't
feel neither she nor Armstrong
is responsible for the damages
Shirvell experienced.
"(Shirvell) is by far his own
worst enemy," Gordon said. "He
has created nothing but prob-
lems for himself. He lied about
Chris Armstrong, and he appar-
ently lied to the attorney gen-
eral, and he lost his job. Now,
the Attorney Grievance Com-
mission is considering taking
his law license away, and none
of that is his fault, according to
him."
Gordon said she will ask the
judge to order Shirvell to appear
for the second day of deposition
this Thursday. Even with the
new lawsuit, Gordon said Arm-
strong's case against Shirvell is
proceedingstrongly.
"All we ever wanted was for
him to retract the statements he
made about Chris, which were
such blatant lies, but he won't,"
Gordon said. "We have to set the
record straight, so we're going
to continue to pursue the suit
against him."

COMMITTEE
From Page 1A
Though the University
already has Counseling and
Psychological Services to help
students who face mental health
issues, MSA wanted to create
an intermediary between CAPS
and students. This is the role
the six-person mental health
commission will fill to ensure
resources are easily accessible
for students, Campbell said.
"While the University does
a tremendous job in CAPS, we
want to make sure that there
is communication between the
administrators and students,"
he said.
CAPS Director Todd Sevig
said he has talked to commis-
sion members about ways the
two organizations can work
together.
"The goal continues to be get-
ting the word out in multiple
and creative ways about mental
health resources on campus,"
Sevig said. "And the second focus
area is increasing students' abil-
ity to use the resources."
LSA senior David Catalan,
chair of the new MSA sub-
committee, said he joined the
Health Issues Commission spe-
cifically to advocate for mental
health issues awareness. The
commission aims to help stu-
dents understand the gravity of
mental health issues including
eating disorders, depression,
suicide, self-injury and bipolar
disorder.
"Our goal is to put the stigma
off that is usually associated
with having a mental illness,"

Catalan said.
To promote awareness of
these issues, the commission is
planning a variety of programs
around campus and hopes to
organize leisure and relaxation
activities - like bringing ther-
apy dogs to campus - to help
students during exam weeks,
according to Catalan.
"Last year was a hit when
(the dogs) came to the (Shapiro
Undergraduate Library), but this
year we hope to bring more pub-
licity to the event and expand to
North Campus," he said.
The commission is also in the
beginning stages of bringing
mental health first aid certifica-
tion to the University, Catalan
said. The 12-hour long program
trains people to recognize men-
tal health crises ahead of time.
These emergencies include sui-
cide, psychosis and self-injury.
"We want to open this training
to anyone that wants it," Catalan
said. "But we want to specifically
focus on training at least a few
RAs in the residence halls."
The commission is also try-
ing to collaborate with stu-
dent groups such as the mental
health-focused blog Vitality
Press and the University Law
School organization Active
Minds. Catalan started Vitality
Press this summer as a personal
project but decided to make it
a student organization to gain
more support.
LSA sophomore Abby Pilar-
ski, a second blogger for Vitality
Press, said she was inspired to
join Catalan in his efforts after
seeing a family member's strug-
gle with mental illness.
"I think it is a very impor-

tant topic to talk about, but also
to help people understand that
they are able to talk about it,"
Pilarski said. "I think people get
really scared tovoice their opin-
ions on depression and mental
health because people have such
a stigma about it."
The sub-commission mem-
bers are also interested in work-
ing with Active Minds, which
organizes an exhibit each year
to promote mental health aware-
ness. In the exhibit, students
place thousands of backpacks
around campus to illustrate the
number of college students who
commit suicide each year.
The International Association
of Counseling Services found in
a 2008 study that 95 percent of
surveyed directors of college
psychological counseling offices
saw an increase in psychological
issues among students. Another
2008 study by the National Col-
lege Health Association found
that depression diagnoses
increased for surveyed students
from 10 to 15 percent from the
years 2000 to 2008.
Catalan said he hopes the
sub-commission's efforts will
encourage students to begin a
more comprehensive dialogue
about mental health issues.
"I think we will have a big
impact, and it's just about right
now getting the ball rolling to
start a lot of our programming
and initiatives and accumulat-
ing the necessary resources,"
Catalan said. "But if anything,
we just really want to start dis-
cussion on campus because it's
something that really affects
everybody even though nobody
really wants to talk about it."

Occupy Ann Arbor protests Rep. Eric Cantor

From Page 1A
even referred to Cantor's politics
in Halloween-themed lingo.
"It's supremely appropriate
that Cantor's here on Halloween
because his vision for the country
is pretty creepy," Batterman said.
LSA senior Jordan Harris
was among those adorned in red
and black face paint as part of
the horde of zombie protesters.
Harris said she is currently con-
cerned about a "lack of human-
ity" within the U.S. political
system and a society dominated
by corporate interests.
"I'm alittle disappointed that I
feel like I've been cemented into
the corporate world, and I know
that a lot of people feel that way
also, so I think that we need to
be more open and encouraging of
organizations that have ideas that

are less one-minded," she said.
Also in the crowd of protesters
yesterday was LSA junior Aman-
da Tracy, who held a sign that
read "RIP LGBTQ Rights." Tracy
said student activism helps insti-
gate social change, especially
when it comes to wealth distri-
bution - a major concern of the
Occupy Wall Street movement.
She added that political activism
among young people will help
maintain the rights of LGBTQ
couples, and she expressed her
disappointment with a pending
state bill that could deny same-
sex partners benefits.
"The reasons our politicians
are able to get away with such
an unfair distribution of wealth
is that through our silence, we're
giving them implied consent,"
Tracy said. "But when we gather
together as representatives of

our own economic classes, we
show them that we're not blind.
We can see what they are doing
and ... they cannot govern us like
this. They are not representing
our interests."
Amin Al-Qadi, a junior at East-
ern Michigan University, came to
the demonstration withhis grand-
mother, Carolyn Al-Qadi. He said
that since Cantor comes from a
prosperous family, he fails to rec-
ognize the needs of lower- and
middle-class citizens, particularly
college students facing mounting
debt from student loans.
"He's a younger guy, so you
think he'd be able to understand
that we're going to come out
of college with thousands and
thousands in debt, but he came
from that rich 1 percent ..." Al-
Qadi said.
He added that politicians like

Cantor should make policy deci-
sions with all of their constitu-
ents in mind, particularly the
student demographic, which has
struggled with job and financial
security in recent years.
Ann Arbor resident Paula
Christensen attended the protest
with her friend Cathy Helton,
a fellow city resident and Uni-
versity alum. Helton said she is
frustrated by Cantor's dismissal
of the Occupy Wall Street move-
ment, particularly after he laud-
ed the Tea Party's social activism
two years ago.
"The minute the Occupy
Wall Street people came out, he
changed his mind completely
and said, 'Oh these people are
pinning Americans against
Americans,"' Helton said. "No,
these people are standing up for
Americans."

She added that Cantor has
consistently blocked legislation
the Obama administration has
worked to implement.
"He has done nothing but
obstruct President Obama in
every kind of situation and law
that he's tried to pass to help the
middle class, to help students,
the poor, to give health care for
everyone," Helton said. "I just
can't imagine how these people
have a conscience, I don't even
know how they sleep at night
when all they care about is creat-
ing more wealth for themselves
and their friends."
With the 2012 presidential
election just a year away, Hel-
ton said she is concerned about
ambivalent citizens failing to
cast their ballots and make their
voices heard.
"I've heard people think that

Obama hasn't done enough and
so will just sit at home and not
vote," Helton said. "He may not
be perfect, but look at what your
options are at this point. The
Republicans are just going to
crush our country."
University alum Clare Levi-
joki, who works on Occupy Ann
Arbor's press committee, said
the ultimate goal for organized
protests is to pressure politicians
to act with the interests of their
constituents - rather than their
friends and fundraisers - in
mind.
"I feel that (the Occupy move-
ment shows) there are people
that are so unhappy, they are
willing to live in tents in the
rain to demonstrate that they're
unhappy," Levijoki said. "So I'm
hoping that might push a little
change in Washington."



GRAFFITI
From Page 1A
decrease property values and has
a negative impact on the sense of
safety and security for residents
and visitors," a city of Ann Arbor
press release states.
Under the ordinance, which
was unanimously passed by the
Ann Arbor City Council in 2009,

property owners have seven to
nine days to remove graffiti from
their property after being notified
by the city.
The time frame depends on
whether the notice was posted
at the property or mailed to the
property owner. Owners can
either physically remove the van-
dalism or paint over it. If owners
do not remove graffiti from their
property within the specified

time frame, the city can remove
the graffiti and charge the cost of
removal to the property owner. If
the property owner does not pay
the city for these charges, the city
could add the charges in the own-
er's property taxes.
The Community Standards
Unit, which is working to ensure
residents' compliance with the
graffiti ordinance, works to
enforce city ordinances on public

health, welfare and safety. Offi-
cers enforce parking laws and cite
residents for violations that may
affect the city's "quality of life,"
such as failing to maintain their
lawn or leaving their garbage on
the street.
City Council member Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) said the
ordinance will ensure that high-
traffic areas like downtown will
be free of vandalism.

"I was around downtown (yes-
terday), and when you look, yeah,
it is noticeable," Kunselman said.
"You can't let that get out of con-
trol."
Kunselman said he believes
graffiti can be a valid form of pub-
lic art, but he thinks "tagging" - a
vandal's trademark image or sig-
nature - is not included in this
definition.
"Certainly, graffiti-style public

art has its place, but I think it has
to follow some protocols," Kunsel-
man said.
Referring to the Graffiti Alley
on East Liberty Street next to the
Michigan Theater, Kunselman
noted that much of the vandalism
there consists of graffiti that cov-
ered up city-sanctioned murals.
AAPD could not be reached for
comment on the new ordinance
after repeated calls.

Before the beat ends

Florence keeps faith

Driving down the Lodge
- Detroit's midnight
autobahn - last Sat-
urday evening to 107.5 WGPR's
old-school mdlange of disco,
house, boogie
and techno,
I learned
that in just
over a day's
time, it would
all be over.
Sometime
after hearing JOE
Bohannon's DIMUZIO
"Let's Start
the Dance"
(a song that may be impossible
to listen to and remain seated),
the DJ quietly announced the
station would cease to be by 12
a.m. Sunday. Sold out to urban
broadcast giant Radio One,
WGPR's "dance" was coming to a
subdued and abrupt end.
Coasting off the Forest/
Warren Ave. exit, I reached my
friend's Midtown apartment to
chat about fading high school
friendships, Occupy-wherever
and the possibility of going see a
show at the Magic Stick, a venue
I hadn't been to since I was wor-
rying about driver's tests and
senior prom. The headlining act
was Boris, the storied Japanese
noise/metal/pop/oh-what-does-
it-matter?
My friend and I planned to
show up three hours "fashion-
ably late," trying to predict the
punctualities of a three-band bill
with $17 tickets. We ended up
simply "late."
To get to the Stick's upstairs
from the parking lot, you have to
head through the Garden Bowl,
the country's oldest-running

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Hoke pleased with play of linebackers At long last, Toussaint
ByT.fimROHAnamed Blue's top back
Daily Sports Editor

You get the feeling talking to
Michigan football coach Brady
Hoke that Desmond Morgan and
Jake Ryan are two of his favorite
players.
Ryan, the longhaired 6-foot-3,
230-pound redshirt freshman,
plays like a ball
of energy and NOTEBOOK
like a tough kid
who doesn't know any better.
And after Hoke said his line-
backerswere too hesitant against
Michigan State, he inserted the
true freshman Morgan in the
starting lineup.
"I think what I like best about
themisthatthey're football play-
ers," Hoke said. "I mean, they
understand and - my boy Jake
can be - what's the right word?
"He makes plays unorthodox
sometimes."
Howso, coach?
"I've got an example, when
he knifed through and (got a)
tackle for a loss," Hoke contin-
ued. "That's a guy being a foot-
ball player. That's a guy saying
I'm not going to (go to) the edge
because I'm going to get knocked
out. But if I take the guys knees
and go up through, I've got a
chance.
"He just makes plays."
Instead of playing his assign-
ment by the book, Ryan made
the play. That's why he's second
on the team with five tackles for
loss.
"He just seems to find the
football all the time," said fifth-
year senior defensive end Ryan
Van Bergen. "If you're going to
make a mistake, make it going
1,000 miles per hour. That's what
Jake does and that's why you see
so many plays with him disrupt-
ing something. He might not be
in the right spot, but he's going
fast so it looks good."
Against Purdue, Hoke said
Michigan's linebackers played
more downhill, running to the
ball - movingvertically, not hor-
izontally.
Their reaction time and play
recognition were too slow when
the Spartans ran all over the
Wolverines. Simply put, this time
they made an "impact."
In his second-career start,
Morgan made a team-high nine
tackles, and afterwards, Hoke
praised his physicality and
instincts as a linebacker.
"I think he's going to play a
lot of football here at Michigan,"
Hoke declared.
Morgan would've played more
earlier in the season had he not
tweaked his hamstring in the

Redshirt freshman linebackerJake Ryan (right) ranks second on the team with five tackles for loss this season.

last week of training camp. His
production has grown as he has
grown more comfortable. He
has 18 tackles in the past three
games.
"Desmond does a great job of
self-critiquing and self-criticiz-
ing and making sure he doesn't
(continue to make mistakes),"
Van Bergen said. "He really
understands, for a freshman,
(he) has a maturity to know how
Michigan defense is supposed to
be played. He has the best effort
- as good an effort as anybody
else on the field."
With two freshmen starting at
linebacker - the position Hoke
played himself - it took two spe-
cial players to usurp the gang
of veterans who are still vying
for playing time at the position.
Hoke said he'd never had to rely
on so many starting freshmen
- Ryan, Morgan and true fresh-
man cornerback Blake Countess
- on a team that could still wina
conference championship.
"The best players have to
play," Hoke said. "If we don't play
the best players, not matter who
they are, where they're from,
what age they are, then we're
cheating the program. And we're
not going to cheat the program."
HAGGLING OVER HAGERUP:
When sophomore punter Will
Hagerup returned from his
four-game suspension against
Minnesota, there wasn't much
discussion about whether he'd
lost his job.
Hagerup was coming off a
fantastic freshman season - he
averaged 44 yards per punt and
had 11 punts inside the 20-yard
line. He lessened the pain of
losing all-time great Michigan
punter Zoltan Mesko to gradua-

tion.
But four games after his 2011
season debut, Hagerup has
underwhelmed and now may
have to fight off freshman Matt
Wile, who handled the punting
duties while Hagerup sat out.
Though he's punted the ball
just 12 times in four games, Hag-
erup has averaged just 35 yards
per punt, compared to the fresh-
man Wile's 41-yard average.
"I think he had the one - the
first punt was a good punt," Hoke
said of Haegrup's first 49-yard
punt. "The second punt (which
went 32 yards), the inconsistency
there. ... We've got good compe-
tition because Matt (Wile) there
is competing at both (punter and
kicker). So we'll compete there
like we do any other position."
Could the time off have left
Hagerup rusty?
"No," Hoke said flatly. "He's
punted. He might be pressing a
little bit, which I think he does."
In fairness to Hagerup, Hoke
praised him for placing four
punts inside the 20-yard line
after a windy game in East Lan-
sing.
PINK'S OUT: Iowa's Kinnick
Stadium is famous for its pink
visitors' locker room - the walls,
the floors - even the toilet - are
pink.
When Van Bergen was asked
about it, his answer dripped with
sarcasm.
"I love the pink locker room,"
Van Bergen said. "I've never had
an issue with the pink locker
room. I think it gives it a nice
decor. The Feng Shui feels real
good before a game.
"As you get in there and you
see the pink, it warms you up.
It's very welcoming. I think more

teams should go with pink. I
have no problem with it. I think
it's a great touch and better than
the oft-white jail cell look. So, I
say paint them up."
"You really know what feng
shui is?" one reporter asked.
"It's a word," Van Bergen said,
cracking a smile.
KOVACS, BARNUM AND
LEWAN UPDATES: Redshirt
junior safety Jordan Kovacs
(knee) and redshirt junior left
guard Ricky Barnum (ankle) are
day-to-day, Hoke said.
Barnum has missed three
games already this season with
an ankle injury, and he hurt his
other ankle midway through last
Saturday's game aganst Purdue.
Hoke wasn't concerned about
redshirt sophomore left tackle
Taylor Lewan.
"Taylor's fine," Hoke said. "An
ankle a little bit. Knee a little bit.
But he's fine. He did everything
(Sunday), too."
Kovacs missed the first game
in his Michigan career Saturday.
Up until the final minutes before
kickoff, his teammates thought
he might suit up.
"Thursday we found out (he
might be out)," Van Bergen said.
"It was still - the doctor said he
wasn't going to play. If you asked
Jordan, he was going to play. I
think there was probably a fight
right before we went out on the
field and they were like, 'No,
you probably shouldn't.' ... You
could tell he was hungry to be
out there. He probably could've
played but it wasn't in his best
interest.
"Jordan's a competitor. I know
he'll be back this week. He was
running around yesterday, look-
ing pretty good."

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
For the first time since he
arrived in Ann Arbor in January,
Michigan coach Brady Hoke has
named a definitive starting run-
ning back: Fitzgerald Toussaint.
Toussaint, a redshirt sopho-
more, ran all over Purdue on Sat-
urday, tallying 170 yards and two
touchdowns in the No. 13 Michi-
gan football team's 36-14 victory
over the Boilermakers.
Entering the season, Hoke and
his staff refused to name a starter,
proclaiming it an open competi-
tion in the backfield behind junior
quarterback Denard Robinson.
The pack quickly whittled down
to a three-man race between
Toussaint, junior Vincent Smith
and senior Michael Shaw.
Smith seemed to have the job
wrapped up after a 118-yard per-
formance against Eastern Michi-
gan on Sept. 17.
"Vince probably right now has
earned that right (to start)," Hoke
said two days later.
But the decision was far from
final. Hoke admitted the backfield
would still be more likely to fea-
ture arunningback-by-committee
look rather than Smithexclusively.
Against San Diego State the
following week, Toussaint was in
the starting lineup and carried the
ball four more times than Smith.
Hoke isn't flip-flopping any-
more. During his weekly Monday
press conference at the Junge
Family Champions Center, he con-
firmed that Toussaint had taken
over the starting job.
"I think it's Fitz right now, I
don't think there's any doubt,"
Hoke said. "He's earned that
opportunity."
Toussaint's 170 rushing yards
against Purdue were the most by
a Michigan running back in a Big
Ten game since Mike Hart's 195
W ,e a

yards against Minnesota on Oct.
30, 2006.
His 20-carry workload was
heavier than that of any Wolver-
ine running back in a single game
since Carlos Brown rushed 25
times against Illinois on Oct. 31,
2009. Toussaint's breakout per-
formance could also be attrib-
uted to the bye week. Against
Michigan State two weeks ago, he
received just two carries.
He looked refreshed and ready
from the outset against the Boil-
ermakers, matching Robinson's
170-yard passing performance.
The most impressive touch was
Toussaint's 59-yard touchdown
rumble late in the third quarter.
He took a pitch to the left, cut
inside a pair of blocks, split the
safeties and outran everyone to
the end zone.
"(On) the 59-yarder, he sepa-
rates the safeties and has a tre-
mendous burst as he does it,"
Hoke said. "And the other credit
goes to our wide receivers block-
ing down field like nobody's busi-
ness."
The burst, which was missing
all season, was a welcomed sight.
With his 503 yards on 82 car-
ries (a 6.1 yards per-carry aver-
age), Toussaint is Michigan's
second-leading rusher, behind
only Robinson.
After eight games, Hoke has
seen enough to name Toussaint
the definitive starter, but the oth-
ers will certainly see the field.
"I don't know what (Toussaint
being the starter) does, besides
the continuity of it," Hoke said.
"But I think they're so interchang-
able to some degree. Vince (Smith)
was a little beat up so he didn't
get as many opportunities. Mike
(Shaw) comes in and gives you a
different gear to some degree.
"But right now, Fitz definitely
will be the guy."
So, for now, the case is closed.

Michigan sets new mark at Yost Injuries, youth doom Wolverines

Wolverines riding
program-record
20-game home
winning streak
By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
If Yost Ice Arena could talk, it
would save its stories of unparal-
leled drama and celebration for
the weekend. It would tell sto-
ries of Hobey Baker winners and
National Championships and
future NHL stars.
But it's never seen a winning
streak like this before. The Wol-
verines have won 19 straight at
Yost and 20 straight at home,
counting the win over Michigan
State in The Big Chill at the Big
House. The home winning streak
is the program's longest ever.
But during the week, Yost is a
completely different place.
Coaches' voices echo to each
unoccupied corner of the his-
toric venue as the Wolverines
practice. Nine National Cham-
pionship banners hang from
the rafters, serving as the lone
reminders that these walls are
home to a special program.
In the old brick building, the
dark concourses and worn metal
bleachers are cold, lonely places
during the week.
When the weekend rolls
around, Yost comes alive. And
all of its intricacies tantalize the
A 4

fans, from the wide-eyed young-
ster taking in his first game, to
the old alumnus filled with sto-
ries from decades past.
Even the smell of Yost - a dis-
tinct aroma that every regular
can identify - seems more pro-
nounced when it's hockey night
in Ann Arbor.
In the midst of the program's
longest home winning streak of
all time, the small things that
make Yost a special place are
appreciated by Michigan's play-
ers and coaches, as much as by
its fans.
But Yost wasn't always the
place to be on Friday and Satur-
day nights in the winter.
"When I first came here, you
could sit anywhere you wanted,"
said Michigan coach Red Beren-
son, who started coaching in
1984.
"Finally, we got that turned
around and generated more inter-
est. Then the students got into it
and the fans got into it and it just
took off."
Today, scalpers seem reluc-
tant to let their prized tickets
go to anyone not wearing maize
and blue. Berenson recalls some
embarrassing series against
rivals in which Michigan fans
were in the minority.
"We filled the building for
Michigan State, but more than
half the people were from Michi-
gan State," Berenson said. "It was
insulting, really, to the Michigan
people."
Berenson describes the pro-

cess that forever changed Yost
as an education. After becoming
aware of the impact fan bases
can have on a game's outcome,
the students pulled together to
restore honor to one of the sport's
most storied programs.
During their time as Wolver-
ines, skaters forge relationships
with the venue.
It becomes a home - a safe
haven that treats its kind well.
And its intruders are met with
immediate hostility.
"When you're a team or a play-
er, when you have confidence in
a certain building ... part of it is
because of the environment,"
Berenson said. "Whether it's
the student section or the band
or the overall rink or all of the
above, it's been a positive thing
for this hockey program for a
long time."
The nurturing atmosphere
that Yost has provided isn't
tangible. From the outside, the
building on State Street doesn't
look like a hockey arena. Inside,
though, it's hallowed ice.
As Berenson puts it, if you
want to play in most state-of-the-
art arena, you should look else-
where.
When he brings recruits inside
the arena, he's helping them find
a potential home for four years
- a supportive environment that
will cheer you at your worst and
make your opponents wish they'd
stayed home.
These recruits may also be
finding their family.

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
There was so much promise.
The Michigan women's soccer
team had shown up to its pre-
season workouts in mid-August
equipped to improve on its strong
showing the year before. It was
poised to bounce back from a
heartbreaking 2-1 loss to Oklaho-
ma State in the first round of the
2010 NCAA Tournament.
Yes, the Wolverines entered
the season as a young squad with
18 underclassmen, but they didn't
care. Almost the entire start-
ing lineup returned. Forward
Nkem Ezurike, the team's top
goal scorer as a freshman, spoke
excitedly of a sophomore encore
and redshirt junior goalie Haley
Kopmeyer was ready to reprise
her role as one of the Big Ten's
best keepers.
"I think, hands down, every-
one (believes) that we will get
back to the tournament," said
redshirt junior Clare Stachel
before the season. "We are not
goingto go backwards onthat."
And early on, Michigan ful-
filled that potential. The Wolver-
ines put aside their shutout loss
to Akron to start the season and
won eight of their next 12 games,
starting the season with a record
of 8-3-2. During that period they
jumped to second place in the Big
Ten with a 3-1-1 record after five
conference games.
Michigan also scored 21 goals
during that timespan and worked

hard to shed its "offensively chal-
lenged" label, one that had clung
to past years' teams. The team
was aggressive on the attack and
was on pace to tally the most
goals in a season during Michi-
gan coach Greg Ryan's four-year
tenure. As the offense became
a weapon for the Wolverines,
Kopmeyer anchored a stifling
defensive unit. She limited the
opposition to just 11 goals in the
first 13 games and posted six shut-
outs during that period. But even
in its wins, Michigan suffered
losses. Midway though the sea-
son, the team lost starting sopho-
more midfielder Meghan Toohey
to a season-ending leg injury just
three games after starting junior
midfielder Holly Hein played her
last game of the season due to
treatment of thyroid cancer.
With the loss of key contribu-
tors disrupting the dynamic on
the field and taking an emotional
toll on the team, Michigan strug-
gled mightily towards the end
of the season. Players shuffled
positions to try to fill the void left
by Toohey and Hein, but their
absence was too much to over-
come. The team lost all but one
of their last six games and was
shut out in four of those contests,
including crippling home losses
to Northwestern and Ohio State.
Staring junior midfielder Emily
Jaffe was also sorely missed
over the final three games, as
she underwent an appendec-
tomy. The offense became ane-
mic and one-dimensional. Until

senior. defender Kim Siebert's
goal against Illinois with about
five minutes left in the season,
Nkem Ezurike was the lone Wol-
verine to score since a Sept. 23
loss to Minnesota at home - a
span of roughly nine games, dur-
ing which Ezurike scored seven
goals. The only other player who
scored more than two goals on
the team was Stachel, who tallied
five.
"We're not the same team
without Meghan on the field and
we're not the same team without
Holly," Ryan said
Michigan's late-season slide
can also be attributed to its youth.
With multiple injured players and
very little upperclassmen, Ryan
played a consistent lineup of
seven underclassmen in the final
games.
Defensive lapses and crucial
blunders - turning the ball over
deep in their own zone - made
by the young back line also gave
opponents ample scoring oppor-
tunities near the end of the sea-
son. During its late-season swoon
Michigan gave up critical goals
late in games, typical of a young
team. The Wolverines will enter
the offseason with just three
graduating seniors and will once
again return almost their entire
starting lineup next season.
Though it will be slightly more
experienced, the team will enter
next season just like it started

antbunchintentontakingthe Big

it was too late. It was always going
to be Michigan.
The whispers within the bas-
ketball program before last season
indicated Tim Hardaway's son was
already the team's best player.
He seemed to prove it early on.
But just as Michigan's strong start
soon gave way to a 1-6 stretch in
January, it became clear that as well
as Tim Jr. was playing, he was still
a freshman - there was more to be
had. Big Ten defenses were tougher
than anything he had yet seen (he
was shooting just 36 percent in con-
ference play).
Michigan coach John Beilein sat
him down after what amounted to
the team's rock bottom - the Wol-
verines' January home loss to Min-
nesota that put them at 1-6 in the
conference.
The season was on the verge of
complete collapse, the locker room
was in a fragile state. But Beilein
didn't yell at his young guard - he
just talked, trying to understand
where Tim Jr. was mentally, and
what he needed to do to take his
game up a notch. He was coaching
like a father - like Tim Sr. finally
learned to do after that apology.
It worked. Four games later at
Penn State, the Wolverines were
down nine points with less than
eight minutes left. Tim Jr. hadn't
scored a single point, but he knew
he had to spark his team.
Tim Jr. proceeded to score five
straight points, and later knocked
down two straight 3-pointers to
lead a10-0 Michigan run that ended
in a critical 65-62 road win.
But it was nothing new. He has
always thrived in the big moments.
"That's one thing about Tim -
any big game, he was going to show
up," Brown said. "He wants to be in
that situation. He wants the ball in
that situation. ... He prepared him-
self mentally for those situations,
did all the work."
It was like the district champion-
ship game in Tim Jr.'s senior year
when he poured in 45 points - 17
straight at one point - to defeat
rival Killian on the road. Tim Sr.
watched with pride, cheering his
son on loudly.
Then there was that December
night at Pine Crest. The Panthers
featured Brandon Knight, one of
the top point guards in the nation
and a consensus top-10 recruit. He
would go on to star as a freshman at
Kentucky last season before being
picked eighth overall in the 2010
NBA Draft.
This was the kind of game Tim
8B Tipoff -November 1, 2011

Jr. lived for. It felt like the state
finals - Pine Crest's gym could
only hold about 1,500 people, but at
least 2,500 were squeezed in. Col-
lege coaches from all over the state
of Florida were there to watch, and
so too was Beilein, who would get
an early preview of what his future
star could do on a bigastage.
Tim Jr. wanted to prove that
rankings don't mean anything.
He demanded to guard the all-
everything Knight, even though
he was several inches taller and a
couple steps slower than the point
guard. And at the end, the underdog
proved he could hang with the big
boys. Knight finished with 36 points
- Tim Jr. with 42.
In Latvia this summer, Tim Jr.
proved his mettle once again. He
was playing for Team USA - like
his father had 10 years earlier in the
Sydney Olympics.
Entering its final game against
Australia in a fight for fifth place,
the U19 team was desperate to sal-
vage something out of the difficult
trip. Tim Jr. responded, putting up a
personal tournament-best 21 points
to lead his teammates to a 78-77
win.
"When he gets (shots) like that
shot he hit against Illinois in the Big
Ten Tournament, to the shot he hit
against Duke, those were shots that
were certainly big shots," Beilein
said. "He lives for that, without
even maybe knowing it, because he
just stays in the moment."
How does a skinny 6-foot-3
high school guard respected by
so few colleges become an All-Big
Ten player? How does he become
NBAdraft.net's projected sixth
overall pick - eight spots higher
than Tim Sr. was chosen - in the
2013 NBA Draft?
Hard work. It's what defines Tim
Jr. as a player, ever since the seventh
grade when his father first noticed.
Tim Sr. calls him a "sponge," eager-
ly soaking up all the coaching he
can and attacking workouts and
practices with the same intensity.
He made sure his son was going to
earn his accolades.
"There's a lot of players with
(good) DNA that may not have that
same drive," Beilein said. "Tim'sgot
it. He's grown up with great focus,
(knowing) what it takes to achieve.
Tim likes to work hard, so that
he can achieve success and not be
given success."
In many ways, Tim Jr. is still
that same kid who was a handful
for his parents, the same guy his
high school teammates razzed by
calling "Timisha." His teammates
just shake their heads when he and

junior guard Eso Akunne talk end-
lessly about their favorite cartoons.
But he's also a man. There's a dif-
ferent look about Tim Jr. this year
- he's taller (6-foot-6, despite what
he's listed at on the roster), more
confident, more determined. The
quiet intensity that he carries with
him always, and then unleashes
with every two-handed dunk, is
stronger than ever. He has that air
that all great players carry - that
Tim Sr. had all those years ago.
His teammates know that he's
the team's best player.
"We don't vote or anything, but I
don't think it's a secret," Novak said.
"And I don't have any problems say-
ing that because he's not someone
who carries himself like he's bet-
ter than anybody else. He's one of
the hardest workers on the team,
got one of the best attitudes on the
team."
With that talent comes the
responsibility to lead. Novak and
Stu Douglass are the captains, and
the obvious guys that the other
playerslook up to. But they're aware
that they have to groom the next
man for the job because they're not
going to be around next year. And
they know this is Tim Jr.'s team to
carry.
He spent tons of time back in
Miami while training for Team
USA over the summer working on
his mid-range game, his ballhan-
dling and on running ball screens
- on all the skills so critical when
you're the focal point of an offense.
And he worked on his leadership,
ready to be the man his teammates
look to.
Tim Sr. trained with him. The
two hadn't got to work together like
that in a while.
It appears the dark years of
Michigan basketball are over.
The NCAA Tournament should
be reached every year, players
say. Championships should be the
expectation, they echo.
Tim Jr. answers all your ques-
tions very quickly - almost too
quickly, not even letting you get all
of the words out of your mouth. But
he stops when asked a very simple
one - is Michigan basketball back?
He pauses for a moment - an
eternity in his energized world - to
think it over.
"People can say we're back, butin
our eyes, we're not back at all," Tim
Jr. says. "We're tryingto make it all
the way to 1989 (National) Champi-
onship level.... We're trying to make
it to the Fab-5 level."
There are a few givens for Tim
Jr. this season. He's going to drain
some clutch threes. He'll have

games last season.

some highlight-reel dunks. He'll
lead the Wolverines in scoring in
more games than any other player.
He's going to explode with passion,
making those unrestrained facial
expressions he's so famous for.
The unknown is how big of a leap
he's going to make. It's an important
question because Michigan's season
depends on it. Those champion-
ships will be won on the shoulders
of Tim Hardaway Jr.
When you watch him, think of
who he is - think of a basketball
player forged by a legacy, by years of
heartbreaking family conflict, by the
work ethic that defines him and the
moments that inspire his greatness.
Think of Tim Sr., watching hap-
pily from a distance, seeing his son
reaching for his dreams.
"I love it, just (feeling) how I
would feel if I was in the stands and
bringing that into the game," Tim
Jr. said. "It's fun when you're actu-
ally out there doingthat."
Tim Sr. was there to watch his
son play against Illinois in the Big
Ten Tournament. He saw Tim Jr.
knock down the killer 3-pointer
that gave Michigan the lead for
good with two minutes left, the shot
that clinched an NCAA Tourna-
ment berth in what was supposed to
be a lost season.
It wasn't the gym at Palmetto,
but it felt like it because Tim Sr. was
at it again - talking loudly about
Tim Jr.'s play and his team, dissect-
ing his performance, criticizing him
at times. It wasn't a flashback to the
troubled past, though - Tim Sr. was
calling the game on radio for Com-
pass Media.
He had never called one of his
son's games before - he'd only ever
watched Tim" Jr. while cheering

from the stands.
This was a lot harder.
"Man, I do not never, ever, ever
want to do that anymore," said Tim
Sr. "It was strenuous, it was hard.
After that game I had a headache.
... I had to bea regular commentary
person that didn't have a son on that
team.
"I wouldn't do it anymore. It took
so much out of me. After the game, I
was sweating."
When Tim Jr. makes it to the
NBA - widely considered a matter
of when, not if - he'll finally see the
other side of his childhood, the side
that his father was living when Tim
Jr. was just that little boy, looking
up to his All-Star dad.
"Words couldn't describe how I
would feel," Tim Sr. said.
But that's a conversation for
another day. There's this season and
all of the challenges,joys, pains and
pleasures it's going to bring. Michi-
gan has more heights to reach, car-
ried by Tim Jr.
In Miami, Tim Sr. thinks about
his son, his namesake. He forged
that name, and it means something.
But Tim Jr. has his own dreams,
and Tim Sr. just hopes he achieves
them, like all fathers do. It's out of
his hands now, though.
The two Hardaways speak
almost every day, usually around
lunchtime - there's alot of silences
to make up for, after all. The father
and son don't normally talk about
basketball. They don't need to. The
father always makes sure that his
son is staying warmup in Michigan.
But father and son are both busy,
and must say their goodbyes even-
tually.
So Tim Hardaway Jr. puts his
phone down and gets up to go, his
legacy behind him but his future far
in front.

The Daily basketball beat offers its predictions for the conference standings
(in order from first to worst, from left to right)

Michigan basketball is finally on the rise. After a season of defying expecta-
tions, the Wolverines must now live up to them. In his fifth season at the
helm, John Beilein will have to adapt to life without star point guard Darius
Morris. Luckily for him, everyone else returns from a team that nearly beat
Duke in the round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament, and a talented crop of
freshmen will join them. The only question - how big of a leap can Michigan
take?

After three years of
ineptitude, Indiana will
no longer be an easy win
thanks to the arrival of
6-foot-11 forward Cody
Zeller - ESPN.com's 14th-
ranked incoming freshman.
In fact, if Zeller lives up
to the hype, the Hoosiers
have a chance to equal, or
even exceed, the eight con-
ference wins head coach
Tom Crean has in his three
seasons at Indiana. But a
shadow was cast on the off-
season when the Hoosiers
lost junior guard Maurice
Creek to a season-ending
injury. Creek, a double-digit
scorer, has now missed at
least half of three straight
seasons due to injuries. Still
recovering from the mess
left by former coach Kel-
vin Sampson, Crean finally
enters a season with experi-
ence. After last year's roster
featured just one senior, this
year's team has five seniors
and four juniors, which
should make playing against
Crean's vaunted defense
increasingly difficult.
Bottom line: Another
bad season will turn the
shade of Crean's chair from
crimson to red-hot.

Northwestern missed its
chance to reach the NCAA
Tournament last year. The
program had never made a
trip to March Madness, but
there was promise with then-
senior point guard Michael
"Juice" Thompson break-
ing school records. After a
quick start in . conference
play, though, the Wildcats
fell flat down the stretch and
finished with a losing record
against league opponents for
the 43rd consecutive season.
Senior forward John Shurna,
who shot an impressive 43
percent from 3-point range
last season, is expected to
fill the leadership void left
by Thompson's departure.
And regardless of his success
or failure in that regard, he
will inevitably draw national
attention for his awkward
shooting form. For now, head
coach Bill Carmody is dealing
with question marks at point
guard, which doesn't bode
well for a team that runs the
Princeton offense.
Quote: "I think that good
things are on the horizon. Or
near horizon. Is there such a
thing as near horizon? I don't
know, help me out." - Bill
Carmody

The tough part is over for
Fran McCaffery. The sec-
ond-year Iowa coach won't
have to worry about instill-
ing a new offensive system,
or about getting his players
used to a new coaching staff,
the typical growing pains
when a new coach takes over
a team. The Hawkeyes strug-
gled to a 10th-place finish in
the conference, though they
did upset Michigan State
and Purdue. The challenge
this season is to take a step
forward. Melsahn Basabe
will be a big part of that. The
forward surprised the Big
Ten as a freshman, showing
great athleticism. The back-
court should be solid with
the return of point guard
Bryce Cartwright and run-
ning mate Matt .Gatens. The
main issue right now is depth
- Andrew Brommer and
Devyn Marble both won't be
able to start the season on
time. But the program is on
the rise, recruiting is improv-
ing, and the fans are starting
to get on board.
Bottom Line: For the first
time in a while, the basket-
ball team might actually be
better than the football team
if things fall into place.

After reaching the NCAA
Tournament for the first
time in 10 years last sea-
son, Penn State's basketball
program must be on the
upswing, right? Well, when
you take into account that
the NittanyLions lost every-
thing from last year, the
future at Penn State looks
dreadful. Big Ten teams
will rejoice knowing that
guard Talor Battle - the
program's best ever player
- is gone, along with three
other senior starters, leav-
ing the Nittany Lions with
less than 23% of last year's
scoring. To make matters
worse, coach Ed Dechellis
left Penn State for Navy in
a move that had even mid-
major coaches scratch-
ing their heads. Enter Pat
Chambers, who arrives
after a two-year stint as
Boston University's head
coach. With little talent and
even less experience - Penn
State has just one senior
and 11 underclassman - the
Nittany Lions are likely the
conference's worst team.
Bottom Line: Penn State
should beat Slippery Rock in
its opener. That may be it.

How do they do it? How

much talent on the roster?
Head coach Thad Matta isn't

Every year, Wisconsin
contends in the Big Ten and
makes the NCAA Tourna-
ment (the Badgers have made
the Big Dance in 13 straight
years, the fourth-longest
active streak in the country).
Chalk it up to Bo Ryan. The
Wisconsin coach never fails
to instill his principles on
his teams. Point guard Jor-
dan Taylor said that Ryan
won't recruit a player unless
he knows he fits the Badger
formula. The result is strong,
physical defense, efficient
(read: boring) offense with
his swing system, and solid
fundamentals. This season,
the Badgers have a star in
Taylor, perhapsthe bestpoint
guard in the country. The key
to Wisconsin's season will
be how it reloads in the front
court after three departures.
Ryan mentioned Jared Berg-
gren, Frank Kaminsky, Evan
Anderson and Jarred Uthoff
as bigs to watch. Guard Josh
Gasser returns in the back-
court after a solid freshman
season.
Bottom Line: Expect
typical Wisconsin. Biggest
disappointment? Mike Brue-
sewitz already shaved off his
ginger 'fro..

With point guard Darius
Morris being the only part
of the Wolverines' rotation
from last year to depart,
Michigan's lineup brings
back the most continuity
of the Big Ten teams. This
could work to the Wolver-
ines' advantage early in
the year when opposing
teams are still shuffling
their lineups and figuring
out what works. Fresh-
men Trey Burke and Carl-
ton Brundidge will replace
Morris's minutes, and the
rest of the roster can expect
to see similar roles. After a
breakout freshman season,
Tim Hardaway will look
to take on even more scor-
ing to bring up a Michigan
offense that finished near
the bottom of the Big Ten
in scoring. Senior captains
Zack Novak and Stu Doug-
lass will look to make their
third seasons as co-captains
count and help send this
team deep into the NCAA
Tournament. The next
benchmark will be getting
to the Sweet Sixteen.
Bottom Line: Michigan
hopes the new Crisler Arena
will house a Bentley-like
product.

Purdue loses its top-two
scorers but should be pretty
good this year. That sentence
only makes sense because of
Robbie Hummel. The fifth-
year senior forward was
injured for the latter part of
his junior year and all of his
fourth year. He returns for
the last season of his career,
which started out promising.
He scored in double-digits
each season and led the Boil-
ermakers in rebounding in
his two full seasons. Hummel
will be supported by senior
guards Lewis Jackson and
Ryne Smith, who both start-
ed last season, but were in the
shadows of seniors JaJuan
Johnson and E'Twaun
Moore. While Purdue put
together a 14-4 conference
record and finished second
in the Big Ten last season, it
got eliminated in the second
round of the NCAA Tourna-
ment and can't help but think
of how good it could have
been withsHummel on that
team. This team hopes to
open up the renovated Mack-
ey Arena in style.
Bottom Line: Robbie
Hummel. Robbie Hummel.
Robbie Hummel. Robbie
Hummel. Robbie Hummel.

It didn't matter that Mich-
igan State wasn't ranked
in either preseason top-25
poll. When the Big Ten rank-
ings came out, the Spartans
were right back where they
always are: the top three.
All-Big Ten senior forward
Draymond Green will need
to score, rebound and most
importantly, prevent the
leadership and chemis-
try issues that plagued last
year's team. The Spartans
have a strong frontcourt, but
need to replace their starters
in the backcourt, including
two-time All-Big Ten First
Team point guard Kalin
Lucas. Sophomore Keith
Appling will step in at the
point, while fifth-year senior
guard Brandon Wood could
be the second scoring option.
The Spartans will play good
defense, but need Appling
to be serviceable enough to
allow Green and Wood to
put points on the board. If
they can, watch out for the
green and white.
Bottom line: Nobody at
Michigan cares how many
days it's been since Michi-
gan State beat the Wolver-
ines in basketball, but it's a
big number.

Tubby Smith must feel a
little like Alice in Wonder-
land - you're not at Ken-
tucky anymore, Tubby. The
Golden Gopher headman has
found coaching Minnesota
a little more difficult having
made the NCAA Tournament
just twice in his four sea-
sons. Last year, the Gophers
didn't make any postseason
tournament after dropping
10 of its last 11 games to fin-
ish ninth in the conference.
The Gophers still have one
of the better frontcourts in
the Big Ten with preseason
All-Big Ten forward Trevor
Mbakwe and center Ralph
Sampson III. Mbakwe, in
particular, is a force. But just
like last season, point guard
is a weakness. Freshmar
Andre Hollins could seize
the job immediately, though
there are more experienced
options in sophomore Maver-
ick Ahanmisi and junior col-
lege transfer Julian Welch.
Quote: "Coming into
every season, I always cry
to lead the conference in
rebounding. I want to lead
in blocked shots too, but I
have to battle with this guy
(Sampson III) every day." -
Mbakwe

distinctly remember when I
realized Michigan was get-
tingsomething special in
freshman point guard Trey Burke.
It was March, and my bud-
dies and I were pre-gaming - er,
preparing - to go out on a Friday
night. I was DJ-ing on my friend's
Macbook, and
after choosing
a jam, I remem-
bered that
Burke's high-
lights from his
senior season
at Northland
High School in LUKE
Columbus had PASCH
been posted
online earlier
that day. So, with the bass still
thumping, I opened YouTube and
cued up the video.
For two minutes, I watched
Burke put on a clinic. He drains
contested threes and scores in the
lane over defenders eight inches
taller than him. And as elusive as
he is with the ball in his hands, he
still knows when to dish to an open
teammate. It's all very impres-
sive. But I was just about ready to
dismiss it as another recruiting
video that strategically highlights
a player's strengths and never his
flaws.
Then, the final clip floored me.

A defender picks up Burke at
half court, where he dribbles left
to right. Trying to beat the press,
Burke turns on the jets, but his
opponent sticks with him nicely.
Then, ina maneuver I wasn't
aware was physically possible
without shredding an MCL, Burke
plants his right foot and stops on
a dime. His defender, meanwhile,
hits the deck - he wanted to stop
with Burke, but his ankles gave out
instead.
As Burke calmly pulls up to
bury a 3-pointer at the buzzer, my
friends and I exploded in our best
impressions of those Andl Mix-
tape audiences from back in the
day (OHHHHHH HOWDID HE -
THAT WAS COLD-BLOODED).
Seriously. Go watch the video.
The clip comes at 2:27.
Bottom line: this kid can ball.
Inexperience aside, it's fair to label
Burke the most athletic player on
the Wolverines' roster - he may
very well be the best athlete Mich-
igan coach John Beilein has ever
recruited. And whatever he lacks
in height, he makes up for with
quickness and agility.
Ignore the coach-speak. Beilein
says he won't name Darius Mor-
ris's replacement at point guard
until after the exhibition matchup
with Wayne State on Friday. He
claims that senior co-captain Stu

Douglass is havingthe best fall
practices of his career, and Burke's
freshman cohort Carlton Brun-
didge knows how to score the bas-
ketball very well.
Granted, he's probably not
lying. Douglass and Brundidge
are solid guards that fit Beilein's
offense beautifully. But Douglass
is a combo guard who's best suited
as a shooter off the bench, and
Brundidge is a tad behind Burke in
his development and would ben-
efit tremendously from a redshirt
year, or at least a year with limited
minutes.
I sat down with Beilein last
Thursday at Big Ten Media Day
and busted his chops one last time
before leaving the ballroom. I told
him I knew he's just hiding his
cards from his conference coun-
terparts - that everyone believes
Burke is getting the nod. He
chuckled and reminded me that
when he was coaching his own son
at West Virginia, Patrick Beilein
only had two career starts.
Good point. Kind of. I guess he
was illustratingthat he doesn't
always do what people expect. But
I don't buy it.
Upperclassmen at Michigan
understand the pains of having a
freshman trying to run Beilein's
intricate offense. We watched
Morris's futile attempts a couple

years ago. It was ugly. His whole
season was a disappointment. And
until he blossomed in his sopho-
more season, we were all readyto
dismiss Morris as a lost cause.
So why make the same mistake
with Burke?
Because in some ways, Burke
provides an offensive attack that
Morris never could. The kid shot
3-pointers at a 47-percent clip (!) in
his senior season. Morris knocked
down just 25 percent of his triples
last year, and that was always con-
sidered his weakness.
Opponents tell you the hardest
part of defending Beilein's offense
is that he spreads the floor incred-
ibly well. His guards can shoot
from the perimeter, which consis-
tently keeps defenders honest and
out of the paint.
But when Morris ran the point,
defenses were able to sag off of
him and clogthe lane because they
knew he wasn't going to pull up to
shoot.
Big Ten coaches are terrified
at the prospect of Beilein having
a natural shooter at the top of the
key. His starting five - or at least
what I believe his starting five will
be - will consist of four deadly
shooters. Burke will bringthe ball
up and see Zack Novak (42 percent
from 3-point range in conference
play last season), Tim Hardaway

Jr. (44 percent), Evan Smotrycz
(36 percent) and center Jordan
Morgan.
And those guys aren't just
shooting specialists. They all know
how to get to the hoop when the
situation calls for it.
Iowa coach Fran McCaffery is
particularly frightened.
"The interesting thing for me is
the seeming obsession with Mor-
ris's departure," McCaffery said
Thursday. "That's one guy. Hard-
away is a pro, Morgan is a beast
and they've got like 100 guys that
could shoot threes and spread you
out.
"And you've got a great point
guard, who may actually - I don't
want to say he's better (than Mor-
ris) yet, but he definitely shoots it
better."
Beilein - you're not fooling any-
one. Burke's a youngster, and we'll
all have to get over the inevitable
growing pains that come with hav-
ing a freshman floor general in the
Big Ten.
But Burke is your guy. And your
opponents are afraid - very, very
afraid.
-Pasch will be quite
embarrassed if Burke is not named
the starting point guard. He can

Young frontcourt bulks up, looks to take step forward

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
If "bigger, faster, stronger" is
the goal, then the Michigan bas-
ketball team's frontcourt took care
of the "bigger" and "stronger"
parts this summer.
Four of Michigan's big men are
coming off their first year of expe-
rience and used the offseason as
an opportunity to bulk up, prepar-
ing to bang with the biggest of the
Big Ten this season.
Sophomore forwards Jon Hor-
ford and Evan Smotrycz, in par-
ticular, return to the renovated
Crisler Arena with more than just
the lessons from last season.
Horford, now 250 pounds,
came back 28 pounds heavier than
he was when the Wolverines fell
to Duke in the round of 32 of the
NCAA Tournament in March.
Smotrycz, now 235 pounds,
brought back 36 pounds to Ann

Arbor - thanks to some steak,
broccoli and cheese casserole and
vanilla cake with chocolate frost-
ing.
"(Strength and conditioning)
coach (Jon) Sanderson put a plan
together for me," Smotrycz said.
"My mom was cooking; all my
favorite stuff, I was working out
six days a week. I think that all
came together and I put it all on."
Michigan also returns its lead-
ing low-post scorer and rebounder
in redshirt sophomore Jordan
Morgan, as well as sophomore
Colton Christian and junior Blake
McLimans. Six-foot-eight fresh-
man Max Bielfeldt will also con-
tribute some size. Morgan will
likely start alongside Smotrycz,
with Horford seeing significant
minutes.
Assistant coach Bacari Alexan-
der said he is excited about what
Horford's and Smotrycz's weight
gains can add on the offensive end

and on the glass.
"You look at a person's ability
to rebound the basketball when
you talk about added strength,"
Alexander said.
"I think adding that dimen-
sion, you get a guy that becomes a
statsheet stuffer."
Alexander said that Smotrycz's
added weight also allows him to
initiate and welcome contact, yet
he still has the chance to knock
down shots.
As for Horford, Alexander said
he hasn't seen a body transforma-
tion over an offseason like that of
the 6-foot-9 sophomore.
An area Michigan's big men
will need to improve on is their
rebounding. Last year, guard Zack
Novak led the team in rebound-
ing and Morgan was the only
big man in the top five. Morgan
pulled down 5.4 boards per game
last year, and the next highest
totals from the post players were

Smotrycz's 2.3 and Horford's 2.0.
"We need to grab a lot more
rebounds, and it's probably one
of my main goals to help out with
the rebounding and do the dirty
work," Horford said. "Novak's a
good rebounder, especially for
his size, but it's definitely time for
a big man to step up and lead the
team in rebounding."
And with at least a year of expe-
rience under the belt of all the post
players except Bielfeldt, Michigan
can expect more fluidity, as the
guys know the offense and can be
more comfortable in it.
Whereas Ohio State, Wiscon-
sin, and Purdue all lost a promi-
nent post presence to graduation,
the lack of moving parts for the
Wolverines could be a distinct
advantage, especially at the begin-
ning of conference play.
Although the year of experience
should help the frontcourt's pro-
gression, the absence of a bonafide

point guard could hurt. Last year,
then-sophomore Darius Morris,
who left school early for the NBA,
was able to create opportunities.
off the dribble and get the big men
easy points with dump offs and
pick-and-rolls.
But the new point guard -
whether it's senior co-captain Stu
Douglass or freshmen Trey Burke
or Carlton Brundidge - won't
have the physical presence that
Morris had.
"One of the things that Darius's
length allowed is him to see a lot
of people that others can't see,"
said Michigan coach John Beilein.
"For our guards right now, Stu,
Trey and Carlton, that is a chal-
lenge because they're not as tall.
But they do have very good vision
on the perimeter."
A rapport with the point guards
can come with time, size cannot.
And that could pose a "big" prob-
lem for opponents.
