CAMPUS SAFETY
'U' makes
. app that
measures
BAC
Mobile calculator a
part of Stay in the
Blue campaign
By JULIA LISS
Daily Staff Reporter
Rather than denying or trying to
prevent the reality of binge drink-
ing on campus, the University has
instead decided to take a more practi-
cal, proactive approach. The Univer-
sity's long-running Stay in the Blue
campaign has a new iPhone - and
soon-to-be Android - application
created by the University Health Ser-
vice, gives students an opportunity
to minimize the dangers associated
with drinking.
The app allows its user to actively
monitor blood alcohol content in a
given session of drinking by input-
ting gender, weight, or type of drink
including local drinks like a fishbowl
from Good Time Charley's and tracks
how frequently the user finishes a
drink.
The app's interface centralizes
around a meter that starts out in the
"blue" safe zone and then transitions
from maize to orange to red as the
user's BAC increases.
UHS Health Educator Marsha
Benz, one of the program's creators,
said while there will always be stu-
dents who abuse the app, she hopes it
will make a difference in some drink-
ing habits.

After snub,

CEW event

'Color Purple' writer
Alice Walker accepts
new invitation
By JEN CALFAS
Daily StaffReporter
Second time's a charm.
Alice Walker, Pulitzer Prize win-
ning author of "The Color Purple,"
accepted an invitation to speak at the
biennial Zora Neale Hurston Lecture
for the Department Afroamerican
and African Studies held in Novem-
ber.
The University originally invited
Walker to speak at the 50th anni-
versary event of the Center for Edu-
cation of Women to be held in early
2014. CEW later rescinded the invi-
tation after deciding Walker was not

the "optimum choice" speaker for the
event, according to Gloria Thomas,
director for CEW.
Walker posted her acceptance on
her blog, noting that the situation
turned out to be "a lovely turn of
events."
"I believe we have all learned
something from our efforts to reach
out to one another, and I believe also
that - if solar flares or deeply unin-
telligentwars haven't carriedus off-
it will bea good time," Walker wrote.
This event will be co-sponsored
by the CEW and the Department of
Afroamerican and African Studies.
While the Center disinvited her to
speak at one of the opening events for
its 50th anniversary, she will close
the celebration with this lecture,
which will be the 16th in the Zora
Neale Hurston lecture series.

A sea of 2,977 American flags carpeted
a patch of grass in the Diag Wednesday,
each one planted in remembrance of a vic-

tim of the Sept.11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
Beneath the flagpole onthe Diag, cadets

Harper: We must
honor donor's wishes

By WILL GREENBERG
. Daily StaffReporter
After the excitement over Uni-
versity alum Stephen Ross's record-
breaking donation to the Ross
School of Business and the Athletic
Department, Charles Munger's April
donation received more than a little
scrutiny from graduate students

Wednesday.
At a forum hosted by Rackham
Student Government at graduate
school's flagship building, students
heard from some of the University's
top administration about the upcom-
ing construction of the Munger
Residence Hall. The project will be
funded by a $100-million donation
from Charles Munger, a Univer-
sity alum and vice chairman of real-
estate giant Berkshire Hathaway.
Munger also donated $10 million for
graduate fellowships.

Syrian opposition forces frustrated
with Obama's diplomatic decisions

0

Rebels upset by
U.S. unfulfilled
promises to help
BEIRUT (AP) - Syrian oppo-
sition forces feel let down and
more divided than ever because
of President Barack Obama's
decision to seek a diplomatic
path to disarming Damascus of
its chemical weapons.
Many rebels who had held out
hopes that U.S.-led strikes on
President Bashar Assad's govern-
ment would help tip the scales as
the two sides faced a deadly stale-
mate said America has indirectly
given the embattled leader a sec-
ond wind as a statesman negoti-
ating with world powers.
"We're on our own," Moham-
mad Joud, an opposition fighter in
the war-shattered northern city of
Aleppo, said via Skype. "I always
knew that, but thanks to Obama's
shameful conduct, others are wak-
ingup to this reality as well."

Rebels who have been fighting
for 2 1/ years to topple Assad say
the U.S. has repeatedlyreneged on
promises to assist their rebellion,
offering only rhetoric. In June,
Obama announced he would pro-
vide lethal aid to the rebels, but
so far none of that assistance has
gotten to the opposition and the
Syrian leader's forces have gained
the advantage.
Violence continued Wednes-
day when government war-
planes hit a field hospital in the
town of al-Bab near Aleppo,
killing 11 people and wounding
dozens more, according to the
Britain-based Syrian Observato-
ry for Human Rights. The group,
which relies on reports from
activists on the ground, said a
Yemeni doctor was among those
killed in the airstrike.
After a feverish campaign
to win over Congress and the
American people to support
military strikes against Syria,
Obama said Tuesday he would
give diplomacy more time to

H- o,

rid the country of its chemical
weapons arsenal that Wash-
ington says was used to gas and
kill more than 1,400 people on
Aug. 21 in rebel-held parts of the
Ghouta area outside Damascus.
The death toll has not been con-
firmed, but even conservative
estimates from international
organizations put it as at least
several hundred.
The president did not say how
long he would wait.
Although Obama had said the
attacks would be limited in time
and scope with no intention of
dislodging Assad, rebel com-
manders had planned to try to
exploit them to shift the momen-
tum in their favor after months
of being on the defensive in
what has become a war of attri-
tion. Several rebels said they
were opposed "in principle" to
U.S. intervention but saw it as a
necessity to change the situation
on the ground.
However, Assad, who has
denied his forces were respon-
sible for the attack and instead
blamed rebels, fended off the
threat of military action, at
least for now, by agreeing to
relinquish his chemical weapon
stocks under a plan initiated by
Russia.
"Assad's regime is going to be
stronger because while they've
agreed to give up their chemical
weapons, they get to keep every-
thing else to fight the opposition
that has lost territory in the past
year and has now suffered a big
blow," said Ayham Kamel, a Mid-
dle East analyst at the Eurasia
Group in London. "The opposi-
tion will struggle with morale
and sense of purpose."
Moreover, the opposition
has been hobbled by increasing
infighting between al-Qaida-
affiliated militants and more
moderate rebels as well as
between militants and ethnic
Kurds in the country's northeast.
An influx of more sophisticated
weapons from Saudi Arabia ear-
lier this year does not appear to
have made a significant mark on
the ground, where Assad's forces
are on the offensive.

Families mourn lost
loved ones at World
Trade Center site
NEW YORK (AP) - Life in
lower Manhattan resembled any
ordinary day on Wednesday as
workers rushed to their jobs in
the muggy heat, but time stood
still at the World Trade Center
site while families wept for loved
ones who perished in the terror
attacks 12 years ago.
For the families, the memo-
ries of that day are still vivid,
the pain still acute. Some who
read the names of a beloved big
brother or a cherished daugh-
ter could hardly speak through
their tears.
"Has it really been 12 years?
Or 12 days? Sometimes it feels
the same," said Michael Fox,
speaking aloud to his brother,
Jeffrey, who perished in the
south tower. "Sometimes I reach
for the phone so I can call you,
and we can talk about our kids
like we used to do every day."
On the memorial plaza over-
looking two reflecting pools in
the imprint of the twin towers,
relatives recited the names of

the nearly 3,000 people who
died when hijacked jets crashed
into the towers, the Pentagon
and in a field near Shanksville,
Pa. They also recognized the
victims of the 1993 trade center
bombing.
Bells tolled to mark the planes
hitting the towers and the
moments when the skyscrapers
fell.
In Washington, Presi-
dent Barack Obama, first lady
Michelle Obama, Vice President
Joe Biden and wife Jill Biden
walked out to the White House's
South Lawn for a moment of
silence at 8:46 a.m. - the time
the first plane struck the south
tower in New York. Another jet-
liner struck the Pentagon at 9:37
a.m.
"Our hearts still ache for the
futures snatched away, the lives
that might have been," Obama
said.
A moment of silence was also
held at the U.S. Capitol.
In New York, loved ones
milled around the memorial
site, making rubbings of names,
putting flowers by the names of
victims and weeping, arm-in-
arm. Former Gov. George Pataki,
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie

and others were in attendance.
As with last year, no politicians
spoke. Mayor Michael Bloom-
berg watched the ceremony for
his final time in office.
Carol Eckna recalled the con-
tagious laugh of her son, Paul
Robert Eckna, who was killed in
the north tower.
"Just yesterday, you were 28,"
she said. "Today, you are 40. You
are forever young. Dad and I are
proud tobe your parents."
The anniversary arrived amid
changes at the Flight 93 National
Memorial in Shanksville, where
construction started Tuesday on
a new visitor center. On Wednes-
day, the families of the passen-
gers and crew aboard United
Flight 93 recalled their loved
ones as heroes for their unselfish
and quick actions. The plane was
hijacked with the likely goal of
crashing it into the White House
or Capitol, but passengers tried
to overwhelm the attackers and
the plane crashed into the field.
All aboard died.
"In a period of 22 minutes,
our loved ones made history,"
said Gordon Felt, president
of the Families of Flight 93,
whose brother, Edward, was a
passenger.

David Handschuh/AP
Geraldine Davie of Pelham, N.Y., cries after viewing name of her 23-year-old daughter, Amy O'Doherty, on the wall at
the Sept.11 memorial during the 12th anniversary observance of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.
O'Doherty was killed in the Sept.11, 2001 attack.

Florida pastor
arrested before
burning Qurans
A Florida pastor has been arrest-

3,000 Qurans.
Polk County sheriff's officials
say the Rev. Terry Jones and his
associate pastor were arrested
on unspecified felony charges in
the small central Florida town of
Mulberry on Wednesday. A news
conference is scheduled for later
Wednesday to announce specific
charges.
Media reports show he was
stopped in a pickup truck that was
towing a metal trailer filled with
Qurans soaked in kerosene. He
had said he planned to burn 2,998
Qurans - one for everyvictim who

Jones is the pastor of a small
evangelical Christian church. His
congregation burned a Quran in
March 2011 and last year he pro-

actions have sparked violence in
the Middle East and Afghanistan.

Court orders
Muslim girl to join
co-ed swim class
A court in Germany has ruled
that a Muslim girl cannot be
excused from mixed-sex swim-
ming lessons on the grounds of
religious belief.
The 13-year-old girl fromFrank-
furt had argued that the sight of
bare-chested male pupils breached
her religious modesty.
She also claimed that accepting
the school's offer that she herself
could wear a full-body "burkini"
swimsuit in the poolwould expose
her to discrimination among her
peers.
But Germany's Federal Admin-
istrative Court ruled Wednesday
that it was reasonable to compro-
mise between the girl's religious
freedom and the state's duty to
educate its citizens.

Zimmerman probe
on hold until clear
evidence found

People gather to look at the site of a car bombing in Benghazi, Libya, Wednesday. A powerful car bomb exploded near
Libya's Foreign Ministry building in the heart of the eastern coastal city of Benghazi, security officials said, one year to
the date after an attack there killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.
ibya's ministry hiet with
bomnb on 9/11 anniversary

Prime Minister
speaks out against
militia involved
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) - A
car bomb tore through a Libyan
Foreign Ministry building in
the eastern city of Benghazi on
Wednesday, a powerful remind-
er of lawlessness in the North
African nation on the anniversa-
ry of a deadly attack on the U.S.
consulate there as well as the
2001 terror attacks in the United
States.
Prime Minister Ali Zidan
issued a stern warning to mili-
tias blamed for much of the
violence that has plagued Libya
since the overthrow of dictator
Moammar Gadhafi two years
ago, proclaiming that "we will
not bow to anyone."
But the challenges are mount-
ing. The prime minister said that
armed men had just stormed a
post office in the capital, Tripoli,
takingemployees hostage.A wit-
ness at the scene, speaking on
condition of anonymity because

of security concerns, told The
Associated Press that the attack-
ers were seeking to cut off mail
to the southern city of Sabha in
retaliation for a rival tribe from
Sabha cutting off the water sup-
ply to Tripoli for a week, forcing
hospitals and homes to rely on
wells and large tanks.
Other groups have shut down
oil fields to protest corruption
or demand regional autonomy,
causing the country to lose out
on millions of dollars a day in
potential revenue.
The Benghazi blast caused no
deaths or serious injuries, but
destroyed the Foreign Ministry
branch building in an attack rich
in symbolism. The building once
housed the U.S. Consulate under
the rule of King Idris, who was
overthrown in 1969 in a blood-
less coup led by Gadhafi.
The bombing took place about
6 a.m., well before anybody was
due to arrive at the Foreign Min-
istry for work and at a time when
the nearby streets were nearly
empty.
The explosion blew out a side
wall of the building, leaving

desks, filing cabinets and com-
puters strewn across the con-
crete rubble. It also damaged the
Benghazi branch of the Libyan
Central Bank.
Pictures circulated on Face-
book showed men carrying dead
doves, with one person com-
menting that "the dog who did
this will be punished for the
guilt of killing doves." Another
photo shows black smoke smol-
dering out of the charred For-
eign Ministry building, along
with wrecked cars and burned
palm trees. A green tarp was
later placed over part of the
building.
The blast also rocked Beng-
hazi's main boulevard, Gamal
Abdel-Nasser, which runs
through the city from north to
south. Several pedestrians were
slightly wounded.
Mohammed el-Ubaidi, head
of the Foreign Ministry branch
in Benghazi, told Libyan televi-
sion that the car carried 60 kilo-
grams (132 pounds) of explosives
and was blown up by remote
control.

Alleged dispute
occured after wife
filed for divorce
LAKE MARY, Fla. (AP) -
The investigation of a domestic
dispute between George Zim-
merman and his estranged wife
is on hold because there is no
clear evidence to charge any-
one and neither side wants to
press the case, a police spokes-
man said Wednesday.
That could change if new
evidence surfaces or techni-
cians are able to extract video
that recorded the dispute from
Shellie Zimmerman's smashed
iPad, said Officer Zach Hudson.
Law enforcement analysts are
having difficulty obtaining the
video because the iPad is in bad
shape, he said.
"We have concluded the-
investigation with what we
have to work with right now,"
Hudson said.
The dispute took place Mon-
day, just days after Shellie Zim-
merman filed divorce papers.
In the papers, Zimmerman, 26,
said she had separated from
her husband a month after he
was acquitted in the 2012 fatal
shooting death of unarmed
black teen Trayvon Martin.
A police report on the dis-
pute released Wednesday shed
some light on how it started.
Shellie Zimmerman, accom-
panied by her father and a
friend, was removing some
belongings from the couple's
house when George Zimmer-
man, who still lives there,
arrived and began taking pho-
tos of her, the report said. The
house is owned by Shellie Zim-
merman's parents.
George Zimmerman record-
ed the items she removed from
the house and also the belong-
ings she had placed in her
father's truck, the report said.
Zimmerman said his wife
was "taking property that was
not agreed upon and he began
taking pictures and recording
the items," the report said.
Shellie Zimmerman then took
her iPad and started record-
ing her husband taking photos*
of her, authorities said. George
Zimmerman went in the house
and locked the front door.
What happened next is in
dispute.
Shellie Zimmerman told
investigators she heard her
father screaming from the
garage. Her father, David Dean,
told her that Zimmerman had
hit him in the face, the report
said. She said her husband then
smashed her iPad.
During a 911 call, she also
told police that George Zim-
merman was threatening her
and her father with a gun.

Later, however, she said she
had not seen a gun. Police said
they found no gun, but that
Shellie Zimmerman's father
"did have a swollen red mark
on the bridge of his nose."
At a news conference late
Wednesday, Shellie Zimmer-
man was with her attorney,
Kelly Sims, but didn't answer
any questions about what hap-
pened. Sims cited the on-going
divorce proceedings and proba-
tion as the reason. Sims defend-
ed his client's initial assertions
that her husband was armed.
Sims said Shellie Zimmerman
found packaging for a new hol-
ster in the trash that day and has
alwaysknownhimtocarryagun.
"Bottom line, Shellie had
every reason to believe there
was a gun," Sims said.
Sims said his client is hoping
to move on as soon as possible.
"The only thing Shellie
wants out of the end of this
relationship is for it to end with
a whimper and not a bang,"
Sims said.
In the report George Zim-
merman told investigators that
his wife had told him she was
done pickingup her belongings.
He said he locked the front
door and went to the garage to
close it when Shellie Zimmer-
man's father confronted him,
according to the report.
Shellie Zimmerman's father
threw down his glasses and
charged his son-in-law, accord-
ing to George Zimmerman's
account. Shellie Zimmerman
at some point hit her husband
with her iPad, George Zimmer-
man told investigators.
Police officers asked George
Zimmerman to remove his
shirt so they could see if there
were marks on his back. "There
were no signs of trauma, red-
ness or marks of any kind in
the area where he said he was
struck," the report said.
As many as seven people
were at the house - friends of
the Zimmermans - and they
all have been questioned by
investigators, Hudson said.
The friends said they didn't
see what happened and footage
from the house's surveillance
cameras was inconclusive,
Hudson added.
Both sides are refusing to
press charges, but Florida law
allows police officers to arrest
someone for domestic violence
without the consent of the vic-
tim.
Investigators are hoping
video from the iPad will allow
them to determine if charges
should be filed.
Hudson told a news con-
ference Wednesday that law
enforcement analysts are hav-
ing difficulty extracting the
video because the iPad is in bad
shape.

Pakistani Taliban, army exchange
prisoners with peace talks hopes

Exchange included
six militants,
two soldiers
DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pak-
istan (AP) - The Pakistani Tal-
iban and the army exchanged
prisoners Wednesday as a
confidence building measure
ahead of possible peace talks,
intelligence officials and mili-
tant commanders said.
The exchange included six
militants and two paramilitary
Frontier Corps soldiers, the
officials and commanders said.
It occurred in the Shawal area
of the South Waziristan tribal
region. The militants were sub-
sequently taken to neighboring
North Waziristan, the coun-
try's main Taliban sanctuary.
Militants fired in the air with
joy when their colleagues were
freed, the intelligence officials
said.
The two officials and two
Taliban commanders spoke
on condition of anonymity
because they were not autho-
rized to talk to journalists.
Pakistan's military pub-
lic affairs office denied the
exchange occurred. But the
intelligence officials and Tali-
ban commanders provided the
names of the militants who
were freed and said the two
paramilitary soldiers released
were kidnapped by the Taliban
in southwest Baluchistan prov-
ince in March 2012.
The release occurred only
days after Pakistan's main
political parties endorsed
peace negotiations with the
Taliban and their allies Mon-
day as the best way to end a
decade-long insurgency that
has killed thousands of people.
The exchange was meant to
build confidence between the
government and the militants
before formal peace talks, one of
the Taliban commanders said.
Senior Taliban leaders are
currently discussing whether
to take the government up on
its offer to hold negotiations,

said the commander and one of
his colleagues.
The Taliban said they were
open to talks at the end of last
year but withdrew that offer
in May after the group's dep-
uty leader was killed in a U.S.
drone strike.
Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif campaigned on a
platform of holding peace talks
and has maintained that line
since he took office in June.
He scored a victory when his
stance was endorsed by other
parties on Monday - a decision
that was generally welcomed
by the Taliban.
But there are plenty of skep-
tics who doubt negotiations
actually will bring lasting
peace. The government has
struck various peace deals
with the Taliban in the past,
but all have fallen apart. Crit-
ics say the agreements sim-
ply gave the militants time to
regroup and continue their
fight against the state.
"Not only is the path well
worn, it is also a path that has
on every previous occasion
been attempted and led to fail-
ure, mutual recrimination and
renewed bloodshed," an edito-
rial published Wednesday in The
Express Tribune newspaper said.
The editorial also point-
ed out that it's unclear with
whom exactly the government
would negotiate. Analysts say
there are more than 100 mili-
tant groups operating in Paki-
stan's tribal region along the
Afghan border with varying
levels of allegiance.
"Then there is the question
of just what is on the table,
what is up for negotiation,"
the editorial said. "No itera-
tion of the Taliban either his-
torically or in recent years has
wanted anything other than
the dismantling of the demo-
cratic process, the dissolution
of legislatures at the federal
and provincial levels, and the
imposition of their own nar-
row interpretation of religion."
It's also unclear what kind
of negotiated peace Pakistan's

army, considered the country's
most powerful institution,
would accept after losing hun-
dreds of its soldiers in combat
with the Taliban.
A peace deal could worry the
United States if it gives more
breathing room to Afghan mili-
tants in Pakistan who carry out
cross-border attacks against
American troops in Afghanistan.
The Afghan and Pakistani
Taliban are allies but have
aimed their guns at different
targets. The Afghan Taliban
have fought coalition forces in
Afghanistan, while the Paki-
stani Taliban have taken on the
government at home.

Dismiss stop-and-frisk
Racially divisive policy has no place in Detroit
controversial police tactic may be making its way to Detroit
- and Michigan's civil rights advocates are pushing back. Ear-
lier this summer, the Detroit Police Department brought in
the Manhattan Institute and Bratton Group to help with new training
methods. Based out of New York, the Manhattan Institute developed
New York City's controversial stop-and-frisk program, a law enforce-
ment protocol which allows officers to stop and question citizens with-
out a warrant, and search them for contraband. The consulting group
is now pushing for a similar program in Detroit, calling on the city's
police officers to become more aggressive with patrolling. Under the
contract with the Manhattan Institute, DPD Traffic Unit will "evolve
its mission from principally the issuance of tickets toward the preven-
tion of crime." While crime prevention is clearly needed in Detroit -
in 2012, Detroit had the highest rate of violent crime of any city with
a population over 200,000 - stop-and-frisk is the wrong answer for
Detroit. A police tactic riddled with racial profiling allegations has no
place in a city with an extensive history of racial tension.

which I only did because I had to let
her know that I did, in fact, come to

Those phrases, called hedges,

I recently came across a Jezebel
article in which the author, Katie

often they qualify their emotions
with 'I feel like."' She goes on to
say that it sounds indulgent, Car-

They're all fair criticisms, butwhy
does the author of this article, a
writer at Jezebel of all places, take
it upon herself to criticize the way
women - specifically women, mind
you - speak?
From one standpoint, I can see
Baker's point. Hedging - adding
words or phrases that mitigate or
weaken the certainty of a statement
- can easily soften assertions and
help women avoid the inevitable

Ignoring the impact of crime in Detroit
is next to impossible. In a 2012 survey from
The Detroit News, 49 percent of the city's
residents reported feeling unsafe in their
neighborhoods. While the Detroit Police
Department reported a 6.09-percent drop in
the city's homicide rate for 2013, 197 homi-
cides still have been reported since Aug. 5 of
this year. That being said, aggressive harass-
ing of Detroit's pedestrians won't solve the
crime problem - especially in city where
racial issues have drawn significant divides.
In New York City, where stop-and-frisk has
been in practice in some form for two decades,
claims of racial profiling at the hands of police
officers has run rampant. Between 2002 and
2012, nearly 90 percent of those stopped by
the NYPD for a stop-and-frisk were black or
Latino. Compare that number to this statistic
from New York's ACLU: "About 88 percent of
stops - more than 3.8 million - were of inno-
cent New Yorkers." Such practices haven't
built up citizens' trust in law enforcement; in
fact, some suggest it's done the very opposite.
"As a victim of racial profiling, I under-
stand the anger (stop and frisk) breeds," said
Paul Butler, a Georgetown University law

professor, in The New York Times. "Stop and
frisk breeds disrespect for the law." That dis-
respect for the program is noteworthy in the
black community: According to a 2012 poll
from Quinnipiac University in Connecticut,
25 percent of black voters supported stop-
and-frisk, while 69 percent opposed it. Given
Detroit's predominately black population -
82.7 percent of the city's residents are black
- a racially charged policy is likely to be at
least controversial, if not outright opposed in
the city.
Besides its questionable effectiveness, stop-
and-frisk may be unconstitutional, making an
implementation of the policy an illogical move.
In August, U.S. District Court Judge Shira
Scheindlin struck down the tactic in New
York, saying that it lends itself to racial profil-
ing. "Both statistical and anecdotal evidence
showed that minorities are indeed treated dif-
ferently than whites," she explained. Because
of this recent ruling and long-documented
history of racial tension within the city, bring-
ing the program to Detroit would likely create
a complicated judicial process before results
could even be seen on the streets, ultimately
doing more harm than good.

ALEXA CINQUE I
General frustration

On Sept. 7, I may have had one of the best
- and worst - experiences at Michigan Stadi-
um. I don't know if I've ever felt the energy in
Ann Arbor as much as I did on Saturday lead-
ing up to the night game against the Universi-
ty of Notre Dame. I expected the school spirit,
excitement and pride from students and fans
that contributed to the amazing atmosphere
that permeated the entire game.
I definitely did not expect the complete apa-
thy, rudeness and general poor customer ser-
vice that I experienced from the event staff.
Because of the new general-admission
policy, my friends and I decided it'd be a good
idea to get to the game early, as the policy is
intended to promote. Arriving around 5:30
p.m., there were still some wristbands left
that allow admission to the lower sections,
but not many. Before going into the "O" queue,
one of the workers told my group to split up to
go into two different gates so we could all sit
in the lower bowl.
But for whatever reason, the wristbands
were miscounted. My friend and I were then
separated from our group. At first we were
told to sit behind them in the same section.
While this wasn't ideal, we were willing to
do it. But as we were walking toward the sec-
tion, we realized that they were in section 31
and we were in 29. Feeling very frustrated, I
headed back to the ticket area and talked to an
event staff member and explained my plight,
saying that I understand that this mix up was
nobody's fault, but that I was hopingto be able
to exchange my section for 31. I was met with
a rude, uncaring attitude and was told that
this new policy is just something "I need to
adjust to."
After exchanging my own story with other
friends, I found out that I wasn't the only stu-
dent to have a subpar experience. One of my
best friends camped out the night before and
was first inline. Yet, waiting 22 hours only led
to him beingin the third row, as he was essen-
tially trampled as everyone ran to the front.

Another friend witnessed the row in front of
her be overbooked - only to be met with the
event staff having no idea how to fix the issue
and doing nothing about it.
If this general-admission policy is going
to hold up, employees of Michigan Stadium
need to be trained in how to deal with poten-
tial ticketing and seating issues. They should
also be more empathetic to the students. Just
because we're students doesn't mean that we
don't a right to fair treatment at these events.
We're paying customers who, incidentally,
have the highest ticket cost of all of the Big
10 universities. We should receive the excel-
lent customer service I know the University
strives to provide, even if we are "just" stu-
dents. Instead of being treated with dignity,
we were herded like cattle into the stadium
- packing us in so tightly to make the student
section look great on television.
The game itself was amazing. It was prob-
ably the best crowd I've ever been a part of,
and I'll never forget the chills I had as we sang
"The Victors" after the win. However, I'll also
never forget the terrible treatment I experi-
enced prior to the game.
I understand that there are more than
100,000 fans in the stadium at a time and that
some of these problems are no one's fault and
will have to be worked out with time. There
were many event staff employees that were
very understanding and kind, and I appreci-
ate their attitudes. But as Head football coach
Brady Hoke said, "This is Michigan for God's
sakes." Is it possible that other Big 10 schools,
including Ohio State University, have much
more functional and logical general-admis-
sions policies?
For now, I, along with many other Wolver-
ines, am not impressed withgeneral admission
thus far. Hopefully, the Athletic Department
will learn from its mistakes and restructure
the policy for upcoming games and seasons.

her connection with Zora Neale

lecture series and famous Harlem

author. While many of Hurston's
works were undiscovered or for-

in the back of our heads," Hayes
said. "It's just really important to
remember the lives lost on that
day."
Some students paused for
moments of reflection as they
snapped iPhone photos of the
flags. Other students, perched
idly on benches surrounding the
memorial, chatted about the pain
of a recent break-up or whether
they should drop a class. A man
held a piece of cardboard in the
Diag with words that told of a
9/11 conspiracy theory. "Bush-
UHS created a "Stay in the Blue
Video Contest," which received
an enthusiastic response from
students.,
The campaign ironically took
off after a touchdown. Heisman
winner Desmond Howard, a for-
mer Michigan football player was
featured ina video promoting the
Stay in the Blue program. Since
then, students themselves have
expanded the marketing move-
ment with the Stay in the Blue
app, intended to keep students in
"the blue" - the safe BAC range
of.06 or below.
Howard said in an interview
with The Michigan Daily that
people, especially on college cam-
puses, need to protect themselves
while drinking and stay cogni-
zant of their surroundings.
"I think that, for a lot of prob-
lems in society - not just on col-
lege campuses but especially on
college campuses, drinking is
at the root of a lot of problems,"
Howard said. "I just want people
to drink responsibly. I think
cards, including fresh fruit, eda-
mame and Chobani yogurt. Stu-
dents can pick up and redeem the
punch cards at any of the three
U-go's convenience store loca-
tions, which include the Michi-
gan Union, Michigan League
and Pierpont Commons. Victors,
located in the Hill Dining Center,
and Blue Apple, located in Bursley
Residence Hall on North Campus,
will supply the cards as well.
After receiving ten punch-
es, students can redeem one
MHealthy item free of charge.
The pilot program will begin this
month and end April 2014.

Soraya said if the punch cards
are a success, CSG plans to
expand the program beyond the
pilot locations.

her agent - that said donors spon-
soring the 50th anniversary event
threatened to withdraw their
funding due to Walker's stance on
the Arab-Israeli conflict. Walker
is represented by The Wendy Weil
Agency, but it is not clear who
from the agency wrote the letter.
Walker's latest book "The
Cushion in the Road," published
in 2013, included criticism of
Israel that the Anti-Defama-
tion League called "80 pages
to a screed" on the conflict and
"explicit comparisons between
Israel and Nazi Germany."
Cheney-Israel did 9/11," he yelled
at passersby.
Throughout the day, people
shared photos of the Diag memo-
rial on social media sites with
tags like "Watching ROTC stand
guard around the flag. Never
forget. 9/11. #USA #UMich."
Or "9/11. How time has passed.
#umich #commemoration."
Kinesiology freshman Caro-
line Alford said she was pleased
to see her friends at other uni-
versities post photos of similar
memorials on their campuses.
Though she was seven years old
at the time of the attacks, she
remembers them vividly.
"I just think it's a nice thing
to do, even though we were so
little," Alford said. "A lot of times
we forget about the big picture.
But on days like today we remem-
ber the common bond - that
we're all Americans."
As news of U.S. involvement
in Syria dominates national and
global media coverage, history
if they drink responsibly they
eliminate a lot of the things that
we see in our society."
While Laura Blake Jones, asso-
ciate vice president for Student
Affairs, didn't have specific num-
bers on how many times the app
has been downloaded, she hoped
Desmond Howard's tweet about
the app last week to 200,000 fol-
lowers and promotional incen-
tives would encourage wide
adoption by the student body.
"With Greek Life we've been
really promoting this," Blake
Jones said, "I've been getting pos-
itive feedback from them about
its effectiveness and the most
common thing I'm hearing from
them is about how great it is that
it's customized to Ann Arbor."
She added that the University
continues to evaluate the efficacy
of the app and is considering fur-
ther enhancements.
"We get lots of calls from other
campuses asking about Stay in
the Blue and how we came up
with that and how we're branding
many punch cards are distrib-
uted," Soraya said. "We hope to
expandto other campus locations
such as the Markley Hideaway."
This isn't the first time CSG
and MHealthy have partnered to
encourage good health on cam-
pus. Thursday marks the first day
of the third annual MFarmer's
Market, which provides students
with fresh, sustainable fruits and
vegetables at a reasonable cost.
Soraya also said she hopes to
promote better work ethic by
encouraging healthy eating hab-
its.
"I noticed that a lot of stu-

dents stress during finals and
grab candy because it's quick and
cheap," she said. "It doesn't pro-
mote good work ethic, but when
eating healthier, students get bet-

Thomas released a statement
in August that apologized for how
CEW dealt with Walker's invita-
tion, noting that "all donations,
for this and for other events, are
accepted with no provisos or pro-
hibitions regarding free speech."
In an e-mail to faculty in
August, University Provost Mar-
tha Pollack said the University
is committed to free speech and
diversity, and the decision to
rescind the invitation "was based
solely on the celebratory nature
they hoped to achieve at their
anniversary event."
Prof. Jonathan Marwil, who
teaches a course on 9/11, said it
adds to people's perception of
the date. Further U.S. involve-
ment in the Middle East could be
viewed as an extension of 9/11,
even if there is no direct relation,
he said.
"They all have a kind of con-
nection, in a fuzzy sort of way,
in the American mind, with
9/11," he said. "We connect what
comes afterward with what came
before, even though they may
have no connection at all."
Although the attacks still
hold deep significance for many
Americans, it's a significance that
has faded over time, he said.
"Memories don't stay sharp
unless they have a reason to
stay sharp," Marwil said. "The
memory is full of things. And I
don't think 9/11, for the majority
of Americans, has a lot of reso-
nance. I wouldn't say it has none
at all. That would be absurd. But I
don't think it has very much."
that," Blake Jones said. "I would
anticipate the Stay in the Blue app
will receive aslot of attention from
campuses around the country as
well."
Recent University graduate
Steve Coffey, one of the creators
of the app, said in an e-mail inter-
view that he is amazed at the
trust the University puts into stu-
dents to work on projects such as
Stay in the Blue.
"Frankly it's astonishing that
they even let us puta Block 'M' on
the thing," Coffey wrote. "It just
goes to show how invested the
'U' is, really at every level, with ...
providing opportunities for stu-
dents to contribute in every area."
Coffey said students are espe-
cially receptive to the app because
its message isn't condescending
or "dorky."
"They're not about to tell you
that you're going to hell if you
drink."

ter grades and their overall per-
formance is enhanced."
When asked if this program
will be effective in getting stu-
dents to eat healthier, LSA junior
Maggie Heeren said while the
punch cards will undoubtedly
prove beneficial, they may make
a minimal impact on the student
body as a whole.
"On the other hand, I don't
see a negative outcome, and it's a
good idea trying to get people to
eat healthier," Heeren said.
A frequent user of restaurant
punch cards, LSA senior Joseph
Hong said he's excited about

the possibility of using them for
University-run restaurants and
cafes.
"It personally encourages me
to buy their products," Hong said.

MUNGER
From Page 1A
Harper, vice president for stu-
dent affairs; Henry Baier, asso-
ciate vice president for facilities
and operations; Deanna Mabry,
associate director for planning
and design at the University; and
Linda Newman, senior direc-
tor for university housing, made
their pitch for the new residence
hall to the group of about 30 dis-
enchanted graduate students.
Baier described the plan's
emphasis on community spaces
and cooperative living due to an
increased need for group work
spaces as graduate programs
push for further collaboration
among students. While the pre-
senters didn't bring a mock-up or
blueprints of the plans, before-
and-after photos of the Univer-
sity Lawyers Club were used
as an example of past graduate
housing renovations. The Law-
yers Club was also funded by a
donation from Munger.
The design for the graduate
residence involves most rooms
forming blocks of seven single
bedrooms with personal bath-
rooms, with all seven tenants
sharing a common kitchen, liv-
ing area and dining area. Despite
the enthusiastic pitch, students
questioned the layout and prob-
able cost of the rooms.
Concerns focused on the sev-
en-room design, with several
students expressing concerns
about the community-living
style and audience members say-
ing the graduate lifestyle is dif-
ferent than the undergraduate
residence-hall experience.
Several of the graduate stu-
dents said the major selling point
for the graduate residence hall
should be price competitiveness.
The rough estimate of $1,000
per month for the residence hall
is significantlyhigher than many
other housing options in Ann
Arbor.
"When you're still working
from, in aslot of cases, a research
stipend or something like that,
you have to be pretty frugal
with what you're spending on
housing," said Michael Hand, a
Rackham student and RSG rep-
resentative.
Saccone said the cost and
room-complex design were the
primary concerns he received
from an online forum and other
graduate students he'd spoken
with. He added that he was dis-
appointedby the limited student
involvement in the planning
of the dormitory - which is
unlikely to see major reshaping,
according to Baier and Harper.
Harper has hosted one prelimi-
nary planning session with a
four-person student advisory
board and assisted in a larger
focus group of about forty stu-
dents weighing in on the design.
"We're just really concerned
that the project might not be
going in the right direction and,

ultimately, we're trying to help,"
Saccone said. "We're really here
just because we feel that the peo-
ple who have been involved in
this project perhaps have had a
little bit of a 'group-think' men-
tality and could use a little bit of
outside sourcing."
Harper said the residence hall
will not be for everyone, calling
the design'experimental.' Harp-
er said Munger Residence Hall
intends to cater to students in a
variety of graduate programs.
However, the residence hall
will not be suitable for graduate
students with families and chil-
dren.
Harper stressed repeatedly
in response to suggestions for
plan changes from the audience
that she and the administration
had to remain within the wishes
of Munger's vision for the resi-
dence hall, as he continues to be
deeply involved with the plan-
ning process.
"If this were 'just us' and
the funding were 'just us,' we
would have some different
kinds of options," Harper said
in response to a student's sug-
gestion to lower costs by elimi-
nating some of the costlier room
features proposed. "But I think
when you are in partnership
you make some agreements
about what you're going to offer,
then we have to honor those
agreements."
In an interview after the
forum, Harper and Baier both
said they expect the residence
hall to be highly successful,
despite mixed reactions from
students.
"It has this wonderful com-
bination of your own privacy
- your own room, your own
bathroom, your own study space
- and then you come out and you
have this fabulous living space,"
Harper said. "Whatitfeels like is
you get to be at home when you
want, sort of in your space, and
then you can be in a kind of 'cof-
fee shop' if you will with people
that you know and like."
Harper said there would like-
ly be opportunity for students
to choose roommates, though
there is currently no plan for
room assignment or other logis-
tics, like parking. Many students
voiced concerns to the adminis-
trators about unplanned details.
Former RSG President Michael
Benson said he wouldn't live in
the soon-to-be-built complex.
While Saccone and other stu-
dents expressed their misgivings
with the proposal, most offered
their gratitude for Munger's gift
and thanked Harper and the
other administrators for 'tack-
ling the problem of graduate
housing space.
Harper said she and every-
one involved in planning was
happy to have Munger's input on
the design and credited him for
helping kick-start a previously
stalled graduate housing effort.
The project is scheduled to be
completed in 2015.

Suicide bombs hit Egypt military in Sinai, kills nine

EL-ARISH, Egypt (AP) - In
near-simultaneous attacks, a
pair of suicide bombers rammed
their explosives-laden cars into
military targets in Egypt's vola-
tile Sinai Peninsula on Wednes-
day, killing at least nine soldiers
and nudging the conflict there
closer to a full-blown insurgen-
cy.
The bombings in the town of
Rafah on the border with the
Gaza Strip appear to be a deadly
. response by insurgents to a mili-
tary crackdown on their north
Sinai hideouts that has report-
edly left over three dozen dead.
Suicide attacks are a new ele-
ment in the wave of political vio-
lence triggered initially by the
ouster of Egypt's Islamist Presi-
dent Mohammed Morsi on July
3, and intensified by a violent
crackdown on his supporters'
protest camps. They suggest that
al-Qaida-inspired groups maybe
developing a new capability to
strike at security and other tar-

gets, both in Sinai and elsewhere
in Egypt.
One of the two bombings in
the town of Rafah brought down
a two-story building housing the
local branch of military intel-
ligence. It collapsed the entire
structure, two security officials
said, speaking anonymously
because they were not autho-
rized to talk to the media. They
said no bodies were found under
the rubbles, but the attack left
10 soldiers and seven civilians,
three of them women, wounded.
The second attack targeted
an armored personnel carrier at
an army checkpoint not far from
the intelligence headquarters,
the officials added.
The officials said the remains
of the two suicide bombers have
been recovered. The officials
gave a death toll of nine for both
attacks but did not say how many
were killed in each.
"The use of car bombs and
suicide attacks in a new turn,"

military spokesman Col. Ahmed
Mohammed Ali told The Associ-
ated Press. He said the bombings
appear to be revenge for the Sinai
offensive, which he said hurt the
militants by destroying weapons
and ammunition caches.
"This will not stop us, but will
increase our determination to
confront terrorism," he said.
The attacks come less than a
week after a suicide car bombing
targeted the convoy of Interior
Minister Mohammed Ibrahim,
who is in charge of the police,
shortly after he left his east
Cairo home. Ibrahim escaped
unharmed but a civilian was
killed. .
One of the al-Qaida-inspired
groups based in Sinai, Ansar
Jerusalem, later claimed
responsibility for that bombing.
The claim was never verified. If
true, it would be the first time a
Sinai-based group carried a sui-
cide attack in the heart of Cairo.
These three bombings, plus

another one in Sinai last month,
are the first in Egypt since
the 2011 uprising that over-
threw longtime autocrat Hosni
Mubarak.
The conflict in the Sinai adds
to Egypt's woes as it struggles
to regain political stability and
economic viability.
There was no immedi-
ate claim of responsibility for
Wednesday's attacks. Col. Ali
said it was still early to deter-
mine which group or groups car-
ried it out.
However, Ansar Jerusalem
issued a statement Wednesday
claiming responsibility for three
other recent attacks on the mili-
tary.
In a statement, the group
blasted Egypt's military for con-
ducting "a dirty war, deputizing
all anti-Islam forces in and out-
side Egypt, especially the Jews."
The group has ties to militants in
the Gaza Strip, and has claimed
in the past attacks on Israel.

Violent Iranian refuges
expelled from Iraqi camp

Kurt Miller/AP
Investigators examine a van that was driven by the former TSA worker, Nna Alpha Onuoha, 29, when he was arrested on
suspicion of making threats related to the anniversary of the 9/11 terriorist attacks. Alpha Onuoha, 29, was arrested shortly
before midnight Tuesday and he remained in custody on suspicion of making threats pending additional investigation.

Transfer ends
years-long effort
by Iraqi officials to
evict residents
KHALIS, Iraq (AP) - The
remaining 42 residents of an
Iranian dissident camp that was
the scene of a disputed outbreak
of violence last week left the
compound Wednesday to join
their comrades at another camp
near Baghdad airport, accord-
ing to Iraqi officials and repre-
sentatives for the exiles.
The transfer marks the end
of a years-long effort by Iraqi
authorities to evict members of
the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq dissi-
dent group from Camp Ashraf,
an isolated Saddam Hussein-era
compound that the group was
extremely reluctant to leave.
The MEK is staunchly
opposed to Iran'sclerical regime,
and thousands of its members
were granted sanctuary inside
Iraq by Saddam. It carried out a
series of bombings and assassi-
nations inside Iran in the 1980s
and fought alongside Iraqi forces
in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
Its fortunes inside Iraq
turned sharply with Saddam's
ouster following the 2003 U.S.-
led invasion. Iraq's current Shi-
ite-led government, which has
been bolstering ties with neigh-
boring Shiite powerhouse Iran,
considers the group's presence
inside Iraq illegal and wants its

followers out of the country.
Most of the residents of Camp
Ashraf, where members of the
group had lived for decades,
reluctantly moved to a former
U.S. military base near Baghdad
airport last year. A core of about
100 MEK followers had stayed
behind to protect and sell off
the group's remaining property.
A shooting on Sept. 1 left 52
of those residents dead. Another
seven people are missing, accord-
ing to the MEK. The group
blames Iraqi security forces loyal
to Prime Minister Nouri al-Mali-
ki for the killings. Iraqi officials
deny involvement and say an
internal dispute isto blame.
United Nations officials vis-
ited the camp shortly after the
shooting and condemned the
bloodshed, but they have not
reported any findings as to who
was responsible.
Maj. Gen. Jamil al-Shimmari,
the police chief of Diyala prov-
ince, where the camp is located,
and the mayor of the nearby town
of Khalis, Oday al-Khadran, told
The Associated Press that a con-
voy carrying the residents and
their belongings left the camp
Wednesday evening.
"This took a lot of patience.
We dealt with them accord-
ing to the law," al-Shimmari
said. None of the Iraqi officials
reported any incidents of vio-
lence during the transfer.
The residents were searched
by Iraqi forces before depart-
ing and were allowed to visit
the graves of loved ones who are

buried at a cemetery inside the
compound, al-Shimmari said.
The residents initially refused
to leave, but were eventually
persuaded after representatives
from the U.N. intervened, he
added.
Authorities have prevented
journalists from getting near
the camp since the shooting this
month.
A spokeswoman for the U.N.
in Iraq, Eliana Nabaa, earlier in
the day described the transfer
process as "ongoing." She could
not be reached for further com-
ment after Iraqi officials con-
firmed the transfer had begun.
Representatives for the for
MEK's parent organization, the
Paris-based National Council
of Resistance of Iran, later con-
firmed the departure.
Mohammed Mohaddessin,
chairman of the NCRI's for-
eign affairs committee, said in
an interview that the council's
president-elect, Maryam Rajavi,
urged the remaining residents
to leave over the past few days.
"The ultimate reason ... was
the safety and security of the
residents," he said.
Mohaddessin said an explo-
sion went off near one of the
buses as it passed near the
town of Khalis, not far from the
camp, but there were no inju-
ries reported. He said residents
were forced to leave behind
much of their property, includ-
ing cars and buildings they've
constructed since moving in in
1986.

Former employee
implicated in letters
with anti-American
sentiment
LOS ANGELES (AP) - An
airport security screener was
charged Wednesday with mak-
ing threats as authorities scru-
tinized a website linked to the
suspect that contains rambling
letters criticizing America as evil
and promising something more
devastating than the 9/11 attacks.
The letters were posted on a
website apparently operated by
Nna Alpha Onuoha, 29, who was
arrested late Tuesday, hours
after he quit his Transportation
Security Administration job at
Los Angeles International Air-
port.
Onouha was charged with
one count each of making a
false threat andhmaking threats
affecting interstate commerce. If
convicted, he faces up to 15 years
in prison.
The threats prompted a brief
shutdown of parts of LAX on
Tuesday, but nothing dangerous
was found.
Authorities were looking at
the website, which includes
Onouha's name and a birth date
that matches public records for
him. The site contains letters

celebrating Jesus and Israel, con-
demning al-Qaida and lament-
ing that Satan has corrupted so
many. There also are photos of
Onuoha posing with crosses.
In one posting attributed to
Onuoha, he said a message would
be released Sept. 11 and America
"will be reduced to nothing."
"Do not expect another 9/11,"
it said. "What will unfold on
this day and on the days ahead
will be greater than 9/11."
That passage is part of a
lengthy letter apparently written
to the father of a 15-year-old girl
whose treatment by Onouha dur-
ing screening at LAX in June led
the TSA to suspend him. Onouha
was upset by the girl's attire and
said, "You're only 15, cover your-
self."
The incident drew attention
when the girl's father, Mark
Fraenfelder, wrote about it on
boingboing, the blog he founded.
He said his daughter was humili-
ated and shamed. He posted a
photo of her in the outfit, modest
by modernstandards, and said he
had complained to TSA.
A federal official confirmed
the incident was the reason Onu-
oha was suspended for a week in
July. The official spoke on con-
dition of anonymity because he
wasn't authorized to talk about
the case publicly.
The letter apparently meant
for Frauenfelder was dated Aug.

25. In it, Onouha was unapolo-
getic.
"If you need an example on
how to properly dress your fif-
teen year old daughter before
you send her out on a world tour
in this world ruled by satan,
you should look up to Muslim
women," the letter said.
An email message to Frauen-
felder was not immediately
returned but he told KCAL-TV
that his daughter is a "little
freaked out" by the postings.
"It sounds like the work of a
disturbed mind, definitely. I'm
glad he's in custody," Frauen-
felder said.
TSA spokesman Ross Fein-
stein declined to comment,
referring questions to law
enforcement investigating the
matter.
Onuoha, originally from
Nigeria, had worked for TSA
since 2006, FBI spokeswoman
Laura Eimiller said. He showed
up at LAX on Tuesday after-
noon, resigned from his job and
returned several hours later to
leave a package at TSA's air-
port headquarters that was
addressed to a manager.
A bomb squad found no explo-
sives or harmful contents in the
package but discovered an eight-
page letter in which Onuoha
expressed disdain for the U.S.
and referenced the event that led
to his suspension, Eimiller said.

actions that ease suspicions it is
tryingto make nuclear arms.
The toneofoutreach insteadof
censure reflected Washington's
hopes that Tehran will seize the
moment created by change in its
political leadership and act to
ease international tensions over
its nuclear ambitions.
Still, U.S. envoy Joseph Macm-
anus warned of tough diplomatic
action unless Tehran cooperates
with U.N. expertstrying to deter-
mine whether it ever worked on
such weapons - a threat echoed
by a statement from the Europe-
an community.
Iran insists it wants to har-
ness the atom only to gener-
ate power or for scientific or
medical purposes. But West-
ern comments at a high-level
session of the U.N.'s Interna-
tional Atomic Energy Agency
reflected more than a decade
of fears that Tehran also seeks
the ability to be able to make
nuclear arms.
In comments to the IAEA's
35-nation board, Macmanus
noted the "unique moment" pro-
duced by the election triumph of
President Hasan Rouhani over
more hard-line rivals.
At the same time, he sug-
gested that the West will push
at the IAEA's November board
meeting to punish Tehran by
referring it to the U.N. Security
Council unless it cooperates
with IAEA experts trying to
probe its alleged secret nuclear
weapons work.
Iran denies having trying to
develop such arms. It and the
IAEA blame each other for delays
in reaching agreement on a probe.
Ten rounds of negotiations
over the past two years have

failed to end the deadlock. The
two sidesmeet again Sept. 27, and
Macmanus indicated that the
West will consider those talks a
yardstick of Rouhani's professed
interest in easing nuclear ten-
sions.-
The West, he said, will work
with other board members to
hold Iran accountable should
it fail to seize the moment and
"continue its intransigence and
obfuscation."
His comments appeared to be
diplomatic code for an effort in
November to again refer Iran to
the U.N. Security Council if the
Sept.27 talks end inconclusively.
Past referrals have led to U.N
sanctions. While permanent
council members Russia and
China would likely veto addi-
tional sanctions, a new referral
would still be a harsh interna-
tional expression of displeasure
with Iran.
Also voicing the threat of
referral, a statement from the
European Union warned of pos-
sible "action" if Iran does not
cooperate with probe attempts
by November.
The IAEA is particularly
interested in visiting a site at
Parchin, a sprawling military
complex southeast of Tehran,
where it suspects Iran worked
on a conventional explosives
trigger for a nuclear blast.
Washington and its allies
also worry about Iran's expand-
ing uranium enrichment pro-
gram and construction of a
plutonium-producing reactor.
Iran says both programs are
only for peaceful purposes but
the West fears Tehran could re-
engineer them to produce the
core of nuclear weapons.

Miller and O-line
still trying to jell

Sophomore slot receiver Dennis Norfleet was called "spicy" by fifth-year senior safety Thomas Gordon. He keeps teammates awake with pranks and disupts defenses
N et y

ByZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
One hot afternoon in the last
week of fall camp, Dennis Norfleet
strolled into Al Glick Field House.
A mop of dreadlocks splashed out-
ward underneath the brim of his
oversized bucket hat, bought from
the MDen.
He arrived alone, and for now,
no one chased him. That would
come soon enough. Norfleet,
Michigan's speedy sophomore slot
receiver, specializes in making
people miss, and that's fortunate
for him: people always seem to be
running after him, on and off the
field.
He is Michigan's kick and punt
returner, after all. But even team-
mates have found reasons to give
him chase. Thomas Gordon called
him a "spicy, little guy." Taylor
Lewan would like to teach Nor-
fleet a lesson, if only he could be
corralled.
Teammates describe Norfleet
as the team's jester, provoking
bigger players in the locker room
(and they're all bigger; Norfleet is

the shortest player on the roster
and misses being the lightest by
just two pounds) and providing a
needed diversion when the weekly
routine becomes too boring.
The week Norfleet showed up
with his oversized hat, the grind
of camp and two-a-day practices
had some feeling sluggish, said
Gordon, a fifth-year senior safety.
Norfleet made sure they were
awake.
"My role is basically keeping
everybody up," Norfleet said. "I'm
aguy that always has energy, aguy
that don't sleep."
Norfleet's tactics vary. He can
trash-talk about anything, said
sophomore defensive end Mario
Ojemudia. And he will goad play-
ers and coaches alike.
Lewan, though, has become
Norfleet's favorite target. Nor-
fleet and other younger players
occasionally challenge the locker-
room hierarchy by trying to dash
all the way through the "senior
pit," as redshirt freshman guard
Kyle Kalis calls it. Most don't make
it through.
Norfleet takes it a step further.

When Lewan isn't looking, Nor-
fleet will sneak up and jump on his
back or hit him on the side. Then
he'll run away.
Lewan is a 6-foot-8, 315-pound
All-American left tackle. Norfleet
weighs 169 pounds. He is just
5-foot-7.
"He's so small and Taylor's so
big, so people start laughing at
that," said fifth-year senior line-
backer Cam Gordon. "Taylor
hardly catches him, he can't catch
him."
On the field, Norfleet disrupts
defenses with similar delight.
He was recruited to Michigan as
a running back. The recruiting
website 24/7 Sports reported his
40-yard dash at 4.34 seconds. He
returned kicks as a freshman but
was stuck behind a stable of backs,
so he transitioned to defensive
back at the end of 2012. His ath-
leticism was too much to keep off
the field.
Now in 2013, he's back on
offense, this time as a slot receiver
who can also take a handoff. He
has just four career rushes for a
total of 52 yards and three recep-

tions for 17. Still, he commands
the defense's attention. Michigan
likes to use jet motion to get the
ball to Norfleet on a sweep. The
defense has to honor it.
"When you see Dennis in
motion, he's heading to get the ball
so you gotta pay attention to him,"
Ojemudia said.
If not, he'll find the open field,
and there, his size is an advantage.
Ojemudia said Norfleet is the only
player who can avoid a tackle by
ducking underneath it. Meeting
Norfleet in the open field, Gordon
said, "that's like a nightmare."
"He's like a freak of nature,"
Ojemudia said.
Norfleet's 2012 season ranked
second all-time on the Michigan
returning yard list at 827 yards. He
assumed punt return responsibili-
ties this year, too, and though he's
struggled at times to catch the ball
cleanly, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke called him a playmaker.
The trick for Michigan is to
get him in the open field. Norfleet
always seems to be running from
someone, and no one has caught
him yet.

The young interior
line passed its first
test against Nix
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily SportsEditor
What's the biggest difference
between the Jack Miller of 2012
and the Jack Miller that you've
seen so far in the first two
games of the Michigan football
team's 2013 campaign?
Well, obviously the fact that
the redshirt sophomore is now
the starting center. But his
transition from backup to the
man in charge of the snaps -
and the success he's seen there
so far - is the result of two
things on Miller's part.
The first was all the prepa-
ration Miller put in during the
offseason as part of the battle
for the starting center position
that took place all spring and
through most of summer.
"I'd say lifting is probably the
biggest thing," he said. "I don't
care how good you are, you're
an 18 year-old boy coming in
to play with 23-year-old men.
There's just a physical differ-
ence, and you have to get to that
point."
That sort of preparation
wasn't just limited to the weight
room, though. Miller said he
diligently studied the playbook
all summer, as a way to stay
"two steps ahead" of everything
by the time fall camp rolled
around.
The second change in Miller
isn't as obvious, but it's visible
to Michigan coach Brady Hoke.
"Jack, at least early in his
career, I thought sometimes
he was not confident in what
he could do," Hoke said. "I've
seen that grow, and it's part
of maturity. I believe that he
works awfully hard. He has
really stepped up in his commu-

nication, which he has to at that
position."
That couldn't have been
more evident than in last week-
end'sgame against Notre Dame.
By now, enough has been said
about the success of the Wol-
verines' interior line against
Louis Nix III. For Miller, what's
most important is how he and
the rest of the offensive line
move forward from there.
Holding off Nix was argu-
ably their biggest challenge of
the season, so overcoming that
obstacle this early in the season
provided Miller with a good
vantage point of where the line
currently stands and where it
has to go.
One thing Miller doesn't
have to worry about, though, is
chemistry with redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner.
"It's easy because Devin is a
great leader, it's been easy to get
that going," Miller said. "Every-
one up front will feel that way.
He's doing a phenomenal job
leading us right now and mak-
ing that offense go. We're really
clicking with him. That's the
objective of any good team."
Now that the offensive line
has already clicked with Gard-
ner, the next item on the check-
list is opening up the ground
game for the running backs. In
order to do that, Miller says, the
interior line still needs to work
on its chemistry. That connec-
tion is something that's made
significant progress over the
past few weeks, but still isn't
anywhere near where Miller
would like it to be.
"Jelling more up front,
(knowing) where each other is
at, and what we're thinking," he
said. "Just getting to the point, a
good O-line is nothing but con-
sistent play. You've justgotto be
consistent, focus every play and
execute every single play. Once
we get that going, I think it will
really open up the run game."

on Thursday,
where they look to build momen-

tum heading into Big Ten play.
Michigan started 5-0 in 1998 and
2002 but could set a new mark by
beating the Titans (2-3-1) in the
last non-conference home game.
"We came into Michigan, and
no one really talked about us,"said
senior midfielder Tori McCombs.
"It's really cool to see. But at
the same time, we can't really
acknowledge that accomplish-
ment until we get there."
For Thursday's game, Detroit's
biggest weapon is senior forward
Kaitlyn Quarrell, who Ryan said
can cut inside from left midfield.
The matchup with Detroit and
Sunday's tilt at Butler are the
lone tune-ups before the Big Ten
schedule begins.
Michigan beat Detroit, 1-0,

last year and is 7-2 in the all-time
series. The Titans have played all
six of their games on the road this
year, two of which were against
ranked teams. Both teams have
played Eastern Michigan: Detroit
lost, 3-2, and Michigan won in
overtime, 2-1.
Michigan comes into the game
off a 2-0win over then-No. 22 Pep-
perdine. The Wolverines allowed
Pepperdine only three shots on
goal using a reshuffled back line.
Without junior Olivia Brannon,
who is still recovering from last
season's knee surgery and is being
tested for a foot injury, Michigan
moved senior Shelina Zadorsky
to center back and added senior
Kayla Mannino on the back line.
"We just look like we're a little

bit more solid defensively with
Kayla at the back and (junior
defender) Chloe (Sosenko) at the
back," Ryan said. "There will be
times where I know we're going
to get Kayla further up the park,
because she is very creative at the
attack."
Mannino started 19 games last
season and started the first four of
this season at right midfield. She
said the transition to the back line
has been smooth.
"I've told the coaches before,
'I'll play goalie if you want me
there,' " Mannino said. "I'm open
to anything."
Mannino, Ryan said, was an
attacker when she started her
career, but the team converted her
to midfield, as it has with several

other players, such as Sosenko.
"Defense, I just have to be more
reserved," Mannino said. "There
are times where I'm really tempt-
ed to go forward because I want to
score, which is the mentality for
midfield, but I can't have that for
defense."
With senior defender Holly
Hein in the middle, this is one of
the most experienced defenses in
Michigan history. Sosenko and
Hein each ranked in the program's
top four in single-season minutes
played last season.
As the Wolverines keep win-
ning, their expectations continue
to mount. However, McCombs
said their focus is still elsewhere.
"A lot of people around us think
that we have pressure on us,"

McCombs said. "(Ryan) keeps
reminding us that nothing's won
yet. Rankings don't matter. We
come into practice, and we forget
about the weekend and we focus
on the game ahead of us. You can't
really look that much into the
future."
Michigan is now the highest-
ranked team in the Big Ten, higher
than 15-time reigning Big Ten
champion, No. 13 Penn State. But
the Wolverines would rather play
their best soccer near the end of
the season.
"That's something we just
addressed as a team because we've
had such a great start, not to let
go of that," Mannino said. "Make
sure we don't get comfortable or
complacent."

WOMEN'S SOCCER
For freshman Cole, a limitless potential

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
When freshman middle block-
er Abby Cole reached her adult
height of 6-foot-5, it was time to
raise the net.
As a freshman at Grand Haven
High School, Cole - already the
No. 3 singles player on her varsity
tennis team - was forced to ditch
the racket for her first love, volley-
ball, which fell in the fall season
on the high school calendar.
That same winter, Cole excelled
on the basketball court, leading
her team to a state title in her
freshman season, the first of two
in her high school career. Cole was
named the Class A Player of the
Year by the Associated Press, and
was recruited heavily by Division-
I coaches around the country.
Though it was a love of basket-
ball that kept Cole from playing
club volleyball, a passion for her
fall sport brought her to Michi-
gan. In her senior year, Cole was
named the No.3 senior amongthe

McElheny in 2012. Cole boasts 13

more kills than her counterpart.
But through the first five
matches of the regular season,
Cole has lived and died with the

six attack errors in 71 attempts, so
far the long ball is working. But
when other teams figure Cole out,
fewer and fewer shots will hit the
floor. The challenge then will be to
put the ball in front of the attack
line. If and when Cole learns to hit
down rather than into the corners,
she will be a force to rival middle
blockers like Stanford senior
Stephanie Browne and formidable
Big Ten defensive specialists.
It's an easy fix, says Rosen.
"It's a matter of being taught,"
Rosen said. "Lucky for us, she's
been successful at nearly every-
thing she's tried so far, so it's just
amatter of time."

Jim Abbott still inspires, 20 years later

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily SportsaEditor
A 16-year-old high school stu-
dent walked up to Jim Abbott to
ask him about the no-hitter he
tossed for the New York Yankees.
Looking up, their eyes met, smiles
were exchanged and the connec-
tion was instantaneous. The kid
reached for a handshake with his
left hand.
"When I finally met him, there
was a bunch of other people in
the room, but it seemed like it was
onlyme and him," said Joe Rogers.
"He had an aura about him that
was really inspiring."
It was just another passionate
performance delivered by Abbott,
who pitched for Michigan from
1985-88 before being drafted by
the California Angels in the 1988
Major League Baseball draft.
But this time, no sliders or slow
curveballs were involved - just a
smooth speech full of encourage-
ment and inspiration. Rogers was
directly in front of Abbott, pressed
between his uncle and family
friend, after one of Abbott's speak-
ing sessions in Detroit.
Rogers found solace in some-
one who knew what he was going
through, how he felt and what
other athletes might have thought.
Like Abbott, Rogers is missing his
right hand, leaving the left-handed
gesture inevitable. Both were born
with the same birth defect. Rogers
askedAbbott how he pulled off the
no-hitter as he itched for one last
ounce of motivation from a living,
breathing example of how to defy
the highest odds.
Rogers grew up in Marysville,
Mich., just 64 miles east of Abbott.
He fell in love with hockey and
was crazy enough to sign up for
goaltender. He excelled at the
position with one hand.
Abbott hasa similar story.
He would pelt a bouncy ball off
a wall with his left hand and field
it, again and again with the same
body part. When he got sick of
that routine, he'd pick out a single
brick on the wall and pitch a rub-
ber baseball right at it. He'd aim
for the brick in the bottom corner,
and then the one in the top-left.
He rarely missed.
Abbott didn't always dream of
playing baseball professionally,
even collegiately, but he always
wanted to attend Michigan. What
was taken away from him at birth
was given back in more ways than
he could have imagined.
Bo Schembechler once
told Abbott that he could
play quarterback at Michi-
gan. Instead, his retired
baseball number, 31, is dis-
played on the outfield wall (
at Ray Fischer Stadium.
Abbott's wish became
reality when he was
offered a scholarship to
play baseball for the Wol-
verines in 1985 by former
Michigan coach Bud Middaugh.
He helped lead Michigan to Big
Ten Championships in 1986 and
1987, and was named Big Ten Ath-
lete of the Year in his senior sea-
son.
At Flint Central High School,
Abbott took snaps under center at
football practice and got a chance
to play in several games his senior
year as a backup to Randy Lev-
els, who went on to play at Cen-

tral Michigan. His performance
at quarterback prompted a CBS
sports crew to interview Abbott
for a halftime broadcast during an
NFL Thanksgiving Day game. He
played basketball too, but baseball
became his first love long before
his high school days began.
Abbott pitched lights out. His
first start as a little-league pitch-
er resulted in a no-hitter, and he
boasted a six-game stretch with
exactly a0.00 earned run average.
But baseball was about much
more than wins and strikeouts.
"I started training for (base-
ball) and it was the one thing
where I really felt like I could be
who I was, and battle back and try
to prove myselfin alot of ways that
I looked for as a kid," Abbott said.
"It really was myoutlet."
Chuck Johnson noticed. As
a sports reporter from the Flint
Journal, Johnson came to watch
12-year old Abbott in alittle league
game when word had spread about
a young pitching phenom in the
area.
The encounter ended with a
small, quarter-of-a-page article

in the Sunday sports section. But
the lasting effects of beinga semi-
famous pre-teen, just for a day,
re-energized the dream to play
baseball at the highest level.
"It was the first time I really felt
like I was doing something note-
worthy or that people were notic-
ing," Abbott said. "It was a small
human interest story but it really
changed my perspective on how I
looked at myself."
And at age 12, Abbott started
to realize a lot more about him-
self than the average high school
student. His gifted left arm and
only hand was blossoming right in
front of him, and everyone around
him began to catch glimpses of
what could be the beginning of an
improbable journey.
w***
Rogers now plays hockey at
Notre Dame as a backup goalten-
der. Another kid without a right
hand, from north metro-Detroit,
participating in Division-I athlet-
ics. The inspiration he received
from Abbott never died. They
still speak with each other every
month just to check in on one
another.
What he took away from
Abbott's speeches the most, he
said, was how to handle all sorts of
situations. Life throws a lot at you,
and Abbott tells people they have
to know how to hit it.
"You have to hit the curveballs,"
Rogers said.
Abbott's disability gave back to
him on Sunday, Sept. 4,1993, when
he was the one throwing all the
curveballs.The New York Yankees
defeated the Cleveland Indians,
4-0. Abbott captivated an entire
nation, rather than a few hundred
kids, when he pitched one of the
most improbable no-hitters in
major league history that day.
In his previous start, Abbott
was rocked for seven earned runs
in 3.2 innings against the Indians.
"The next few days, leading up
to the (Saturday) start, there was
a lot of anxiousness and trepida-
tion," Abbott said. "I was really
excited to get back on the mound
and try to redeem myself."
What a difference a day makes.
Abbott loved day games. That
overcast, rainy Saturday morning,
he took ascab to the ballpark from
Manhattan, got to the "nice and
cozy" old Yankee clubhouse and
began his pregame routine.
The routine was nothing dif-
ferent from last time he battled
through Cleveland's lineup
with the likes of rookie Manny
"U/hat is taken
iway once is give
back twice."
- MikeAbbot
Ramirez, Jim Thome, Kenny
Lofton and Albert Belle staring
back at him. He'd first go to the
training room and get to a quiet
place. There, he could browse the
lineup and visualize how exactly
the game might go, batter by bat-
ter. Surely, he thought, what hap-
pened last time on the hill would
be avoided this time around.
Uneasiness and nerves almost
got the best of Abbott that Satur-

day, and he'd be the first to admit
it.
"I think I was effectively wild,
to be honest with you," Abbott
said. "I didn't have spot-on, pin-
point control that day."
Abbott, in fact, walked five bat-
ters and struck out just three that
Saturday. What made the differ-
ence all afternoon was his aggres-
sion.
"I think that was part of the
key to having some success that
day," Abbott said. "I was aggres-
sive, I was trying to really trust it
and really try to let it go and let the
stuff take over."
He tried something new, mix-
ing in slow curveballs to keep the
Indians' honest. Abbott credits his
catcher, Matt Nokes, with the idea
in the scouting report. With hard-
ly any strikeouts, infield ground
balls came in flurries. None more
important, of course, than the
27th out that rolled directly to
shortstop Randy Velarde, thanks
to a slider that tailed towards the
outside part of the plate. Velarde
whipped the ball over to the glove
of Abbott's best friend, first base-

man Don Mattingly.
Game over. Let the party in
New York begin.
Abbott described the feeling of
watching the ball hit Mattingly's
glove as "elation."
"The excitement of the stands
and the excitement of your team-
mates, the unbelievably, stunning
suddenness that it's over," Abbott
said. "That countdown is over and
there it is and it looks like it might
happen, you just can't believe it.
You just can't believe it and you're
beside yourself."
Two decades later, it still gets
to him.
Mattingly took Abbott out to
dinner that night at Cronie's, a
popular place for New York ath-
letes. Abbott's meal was paired
with a bottle of champagne at
Mattingly's expense.
"That's what a no-hitter is all
about," Abbott said. "It's a person-
al achievement, but it's a shared
moment with your team who had
so much to do it with. Guys like
Donnie made it all the more spe-
cial."
Abbott's dad was the one that
inspired the phrase, "What is
taken away once is given back
twice."
His parents were just teenagers
when Abbott was born, but that
single sentence was repeated as
far back as he can remember.
"My parents were my heroes,"
Abbott said. "They could have
gone a lot of different directions.
Yet, they didn't keep me away
from experience. They wanted me
to get out there and get involved
and not shy away from the real
world, soto speak."
And that's whatAbbott inspired
Rogers to do. Most conversations
after his speeches are quite gen-
eral, Abbott says. Butthe one with
Rogers remains the most vivid,
reminiscent of both men's unfor-
gettable accomplishments.
Abbott's father's phrase rings
true through the no-hitter. He
laid an egg against the Indians one
Sunday, and came back with an
uppercut that following Saturday.
It resonates with every child
with or without a disability in the
jam-packed auditoriums that he
speaks in every week. The kids
talk about what it's like to have
someone to look to and to talk to
someone who understands their
situation and scattered emotions.
"I just try to share in the idea
that so much more is possible than
we sometimes think," Abbott said.
Abbott's parents simply
allowed him to be a kid.
Being born differently,
there is no denying that
there were bumps in the
fl road. By giving back what
he received through his
parents, Abbott strives
to shatter the bumps that
similar children face every
day in sports and school.
He paved the way for
Rogers, multiple times. Rogers
was so enthralled the first time he
heard Abbott speak that he made
plans to be at his next speaking
session in Michigan. To this day,
Rogers uses quotes from Abbott's
speeches as motivation before he
takes the ice in South Bend.
It was never easy, for Rogers,

for Abbott or for anyone to fully
move past a physical disability.
"I think the most difficult part
is maintaining belief in yourself,"
Abbott said. "I think that when
you're different, you have a ten-
dency to make concessions and
try to fit in and sometimes you can
lose your way a bit in terms of who
you really are because you want
people to like you."
Not too surprisingly, Abbott's
speaking career began rolling
while he was still tossing pitches.
He estimates that he spoke with
at least one kid with a physical
disability on every road trip of his
MLB career.
"When I meet kids today who
have similar challenges, I just try
to encourage them to find some-
thing that they love to do," Abbott
said. "Not something that some-
body else thinks they can do or
tells them that they should do.
Find something they want to do,
and stay true to where they want
to go in life and what they want to
do."
That was baseball for Abbott.
His dad inspired him with a single
sentence, and in return, Abbott
has given back to many more peo-
ple than the children he's talked

to. He enthralled the entire base-
ball nation through his stints with
the California Angels, Chicago
White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers
and the Yankees.
Teams consistently bunted to
him to test his one-handed fielding
ability, but he'd drop the glove and
record an out barehanded. Play-
ing in the American League, he
was never forced to bat with the

exception to interleague play. That
didn't matter, though.
Current Yankees closer Maria-
no Rivera, recallswatchingAbbott
hit home runs in batting practice
during Rivera's rookie year of
spring training, according to The
New York Times. Abbott chuckles
about the fact that Rivera some-
how remembers the scene.
He still says that wearing a

Michigan baseball jersey is one of
his greatest achievements to date.
That, right alongside his speaking
career, are what he calls his most
rewarding decisions.
Abbott has given back what he's
received through baseball. But for
his father, himself and his audi-
ences, Abbott won't stop speak-
ing until he's given back twice as
much as he's inherited.

* GRAFFITI
GRAVEYARD
By Alicia Adamczyk, Daily Arts Writer

Walking down East Liberty
Street, it can be easy to forget
that the University's Central
Campus and hub of student
activity is hardly more than
a stone's throw away. Vacant
storefronts seem to outnum-
Sber thriving businesses, pan-
handlers camp out on street
corners and in Liberty Park
Plaza and the smell of urine
emanates from alleyways.
But for many University
students, Ann Arbor residents
and artists around the coun-
try, East Liberty Street isn't
just another struggling city
block; it's home to one of the
state's most celebrated public
art spaces.
Known as Poet's Alley,
Bubble Gum Alley or, most
commonly, Graffiti Alley, the
space, which runs from East
Liberty to Washington Street,
has provided street artists and
high-school students alike
with a blank canvas for artis-
tic expression.
According to Ann Arbor's
Wikipedia page, graffiti first
started appearing in the alley
in the 1980s, and soon a num-
ber of graffiti artists were
collaborating on murals and
other projects.
A negative reputation
In 1999, the city of Ann
Arbor commissioned artist
Katherine Tombeau Cost to
create a city-approved mural,
a five-month project that she
titled "Infinite Possibilities."
The mural was featured in
countless newspapers and art
blogs and became a symbol for
Ann Arbor's thriving public
art scene.
Graffiti slowly made its
way back to the walls, cover-
ing parts of the city-commis-
sioned artwork. Then, in July
2008, the alley was white-
washed of Tombeau Cost's
mural by vandals. Instead
of the vibrantly-colored and
illustrated bricks, there stood
a simplistic drawing of a sin-
gular figure next to the word

"lonely...".
Soon, the graffiti artists
and high-school students
were back to adding art and
expression to the blank walls,
transforming it into the color-
ful, sometimes crude, public
art display it is today. Stencils
of President Barack Obama
are placed next to the words
"You Are A Terrorist." A few
feet away, a clumsily drawn
heart encompasses the ini-
tials of two would-be lovers.
The work of Pulitzer Prize-
winning poet Carl Sandburgis
painted onto the ceiling of the
entryway.
"Who can live without
hope?"
But the alley isn't the same,
even with graffiti gracing
its walls once more, at least
not lately. Brian Woolridge,
an Ann Arbor resident who
most students knew from his
Michael Jackson-fueled dance
sessions, is noticeably absent.
Woolridge was a fixture at
the East Liberty alley since
1995, years before the original
muralwas commissioned.
"It wasn't really used for
anything, and everything
was plain and I just tried to
see what would happen if I
danced," he told AnnArbor.
com in 2011, "and I've been
dancing ever since."
But Ann Arbor's King of
Pop may have had his last
dance. As one University stu-
dent passed by the alley, he
mentioned he hadn't seen the
performer in more than a year.
In fact, much of the Liberty
Street and State Street areas
are beginning to look less and
less like home. Many of the
independently owned bou-
tiques and shops have closed,
one after the other, to make
room for Walgreens and other
national chains. As retail
vacancies on East Liberty
Street in particular continue
to rise, residents and nearby
businesses have complained
to Ann Arbor City Council
about an increase in homeless
people and loiterers around

the alley, and the city itself has
begun to crack down on graf-
fiti. But whether or not the
alley deserves its increasingly
negative reputation is a differ-
ent question.
A space for expression
During the day, the alley
buzzes with activity. High-
schoolstudentspose for senior
photos, a couple from out of
town gazes at the cartoon
drawings of Homer Simpson
and a few people pass through
on their way from the parking
garage on Washington.
Michael June, a junior at
Ann Arbor's Skyline High
School, came to the alley to
take pictures for his photog-
raphy class. He said the space
is popular with his classmates
and was the first place he
thought of when he needed
to get some inspiration for his
assignment.
"It's a (good) place for pho-
tography and expression,"
June said. "People can just
draw and spray-paint what-
ever they want ... expression is
a big thing here."
He said though he can
see how people looking in
from the street might get the
wrong impression, he's never
felt unsafe hanging out there,
especially given the relative
security of the city.
"It looks like it from the
outside," he said. "But you're
never going to get mugged in
Ann Arbor. It's a pretty nice
place here."
After June leaves, two dif-
ferent sets of photographers
walk through within the
span of 10 minutes, a testa-
ment to the alley's attrac-
tive qualities among artists.
One man carries equipment,
while another, Detroit pho-
tographer Mike Boening,
said he came to Ann Arbor to
scope out scenery for senior
photos and heard that the
alley would provide a great
backdrop.

Artists as activists

W ashington D.C.has
had a significant
impact on our lan-
guage over the pastfew years,
from the reinvention of old words
(such as
"Citizens
United" and
the concept of
a "person") to
the creation
of new ones
like "enemy
combatants." JOHN
Its latest BOHN
linguistic H
endeavor will
be to reinvent
the notion of a "trade agreement"
this fall.
Currently in D.C., the final
drafts of what will become the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
are being written. The TPP is a
massive new "free trade" agree-
ment being negotiated by the Unit-
ed States and 11 other countries
around the Pacific Rim, totalingat
40 percent of the global economy.
President Barack Obama has given
600 corporations official "trade
advisor" status, while Congress
and the public have been left in
the dark. What we, the public, do
know comes from leaks. Congress
fares not much better. Remember
those protocols by which a mem-
ber of Congress could learn about
PRISM? Same deal. They have a
few hours to look at select docu-
ments without any means of note-
taking and then are not allowed to
tell others what they have learned.
More aboutcorporate rights
than about trade, the TPP,
referred to as the son of SOPA,
will reach into Internet policy
and extend the criminalization
of certain activities. It will affect
food labeling, turning those such
as "locally grown," "renewable/
recyclable" or "sweat-free" into
acts of discrimination and barriers
to "free trade." It will extend drug
patents for the major pharma-
ceutical companies, which would
delay the production of cheap,

generic medications. It will also
raise transnational corporations
to the status of sovereign nations
in international tribunals, allow-
ing them to sue governments
whose policies (environmental,
work-place safety) have affected
their projected profits, an act
already begun under past free-
trade agreements. See: "Met-
alclad Corps. v. United Mexican
States." Already, countries and
their taxpayers have paid $365
million to corporations in this
way. The list goes on.
I am writing today to the art-
ists of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti
because I believe this to be ter-
rible poetry. And I think you
might agree. I am writing today
because we are on the eve of this
bill's passing, and while there is
still time to act, we need to act
fast. President Obama will look to
Congress to grant him Fast Track
sometime this fall, which would
allow him sole authorship of the
bill. To deny him this opportunity
would allow our Congress mem-
bers a say in that process.
Let us, as good artists, teach
our struggling writers over at
the Washington School of Poetry
about the healthy benefits of
workshopping your writing.
If you are starting an art
studio, music composition class
or creative writing workshop, I
challenge you to use that time
and space to explore and expose
the implications of the TPP. Due
to its scale, the TPP's effects will
stretch across a multitude of nar-
ratives.
Where are the stories about
threatened small farms? Where
is the dance about genetically
modified food? Where is the
satirical play about the corpo-
rate lawyers who settle disputes
between nations and corpora-
tions? Where are the paintings
of the broken faces and broken
homes of the dispossessed?
Where are photos of abandoned
factories? Where is the poetry
that reclaims our exploited

language? Where are the songs
commemoratingthe success of
past struggles? Let this art cul-
minate in a rotating gallery and
performance space where voices
are heard. Let our art fill online
galleries and the mailrooms of
our elected representatives. Let's
builda coalition of artists and
activists.
Do not let Washington monop-
olize the telling of this story. The
voices of those most affected will
not be lost, but neither will they
be replaced. Our art, as best as it
can, will serve as a humble proxy.
The Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti
area can only do so much in this
endeavor, but let us start a wave
of protest art that spreads across
the country. The scale of Wash-
ington's literature is immense.
Ours must be equally immense.
We are not alone in doing so.
We take our inspiration from
groups like the Beehive Collec-
tive and affirm our solidarity
with an international struggle
well underway by farmers in
Japan, human-rights groups in
Malaysia, protesters in Australia
and here in the United States.
For those looking to further
inform their art, campaigns such
as "Expose the TPP" and "Topple
the TPP" run by United Students
for Fair Trade (USFT) have
begun the process of inform-
ing the public and can be found
online. Sept.23 will begin the
national week of action, and the
University's chapter of USFT,
with meetings Mondays at 8 p.m.
in B810 East Quad, will have
events to look out for.
"Poets are the unacknowl-
edged legislators of the world,"
Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote near-
ly 200 years ago.
I am not here today to agree. I
ask that Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti
artists demand their acknowledg-
ment this fall.
Bohn is demanding
acknowledgement. To join,

I'm going to be completely honest: I have no idea what's happening. 4
Normally, under slightly less high circumstances, I slowly but surely drift
in and out of the game. Seeing it, but not really paying attention until the
guy beside me with the maize mohawk starts yelling, "GO BLUE!" But
now ... Look I don't even really remember who's who. So, the game. Look.
We're winning. It's really light, which is disorienting because the sky is
DARK. I also feel like now is as good a time as any to talk about how
fast all the football players run. I mean, they are FAST. OK, look, we just
scored 17 points and now it's HALF TIME and BEYONCE JUST SAID
SHE WISHES US LUCK what is this life tho. I mean, what's the point,
NOTHING CAN DEFEAT US. I feel slightly disoriented, but the march-
ingband is killing it. I can tell because I'm singing along to "Countdown,"
and they don't miss a BEAT. Way to keep up with the drunk masses, guys!
OK, we are back and the game starts off kind of tense. I'm lying because
I feel goooood and I don't really feel any tension except some sexual ten-
sion between maize mohawk and an innocent bag of popcorn. OH SHIT
they just got like 10 points. They beat us in the last quarter but WE WON
THE WAR. Victors valiant, holla back.

The last thing I remember was, "Meet in Section 30! Section 30 - don't
forget." Too bad it seems like every other friend group has done the same
thing - the line doubles around so that it faces away from the stadium.
Bleary-eyed, I curse the ticket policy.
My heart is still pounding from before. Stepping beyond the ticket
checkers, I thought I was safe - somehow convinced myself to sneak in
a couple of shooters. But a policeman cordoned me off with an arm and
looked at my pockets. "Whatcha got there?" he asked, pointing. I'd had
a serious bout of paranoia, but was with it enough to pull out my water
bottle and wallet. "They want you to buy water here," he said, snatching
it from my hand. "Oh, sorry, I understand, thanks so much!" I answered,
moving along. Close shave.
"Dude - let's just walk across the horseshoe." Before I know it, my
two friends are cutting the gap, and it's get left with the squares or hop
on board. Wordlessly, I slip away from my remaining friends to follow.
We all sort of clot around a spot near the front. "Oh, hey, is that Kyle
over there?" We stand. I feel eyes on my back, but maybe that's the buzz.
"Nevermind, that's not Kyle. But now that we're here..."
The game is a blur. We're never losing, the touchdowns are raining,
but all I can think is: Cottonmouth. Bathroom. Feet tired. Water ... I could
gofor some water. Eventually I'm completely, and we're shuffling back up
the stairs, euphoric in our delirium. We won. Thank God.

The stadium smelled terrible. Everyone smelled like beer. Everyone
smelled like sweat. Random joints were smoked. Which made everyone smell
like weed. But that's OK; it was Notre Dame.Nothingelse mattered that day.It
didn'tmatter that my legswere about to collapse. All that mattered was 41-30.
It didn't matter that Gardner threw an interception touchdown after a split
second series of horrible calls. All that mattered was that he returned it with
another touchdown.
It didn't matter that it was general admissions, and I was stuck in row 90.
Or that I could never hear the band because everyone was screamingso loud.
It didn't matter that all my friends were slowly becoming miserable, hung-
over zombies as the game progressed, and refused to sing anymore of the
Victors because their heads hurt. Some were drunk and some were high and
some were both. Their crazy dance moves didn't matter. Their embarrassing
decrees of how drunk they "really" were didn't matter. They were drunk and
there was no looking back. And, in retrospect, it didn't even matter that the
person in front of me was basically eight-feet tall. All that mattered was that
it was Notre Dame. I was there. It was Under The Lights Part II. And we beat
them.

CHALK MAGIC
The impermanence of
street artwork

HIP-HOP COLUMN
The hip hop of
summer

Local street artist
David Zinn talks
beginnings
By AKSHAY SETH
Daily B-Side Editor
"It seemed weird to pay tuition
to be taught something I was
already good at."
Ann Arbor street artist David
Zinn speaks in a low voice when
asked if he studied design in col-
lege.
He looks around the coffee
shop furtively, as if a little cau-
tious. Our meeting was meant
to be outside, but due to a small
misunderstanding, we're now
perched right in front of the main
counter, surrounded by a typical
Sunday afternoon crowd. Zinn
settles in, clears his throat and
elaborates.
"Maybe it wasn't the right deci-
sion, but it seemed logical at the
time," he said.
Zinn ended up attending the
University's Residential College
to study Creative Writing and
English instead. He didn't become
a writer. In the context of get-
ting paid to put words on a piece
of paper, he described the degree
as worthless, but was quick to
defend his teenage self's decision-
making process.
"I guess (writing) was some-
thing I wanted to be able to do," he
said. "But it was also something
I didn't already do compulsively.
But, with that in mind, I've usu-
ally only used art to pay the bills."
Over the course of almost three
decades in Ann Arbor, Zinn has
created scores of drawings on any
imaginable sidewalk in town. His
tools have included everything
from charcoal to paint, but he's
cultivated something of a reputa-
tion for his work with chalk.
The creatures he brings to life
peer out of the ground with child-
like innocence. The most famous
ones, Sluggo and The Flying Pig,
are featured on the homepage of
his website, both draped by a sim-
ple, Pixar-esque message: "Occu-
py your imagination. Or someone
else will."
"One of the things that made
sidewalk art so appealing, in addi-
tion to it being ludicrous - I mean,
you're playing with children's toys
so there's no highfalutin baggage,"
he said,"is that it's not permanent."
Permanence, Zinn explains,
can magnify the relevance an art-
ist inherently implies while craft-
ing more traditional work.
"I tried to stay away from
what a lot of people call 'real art'
because whenever you put brush
to canvas, there's this pressure
of wondering whether or not the
time, effort and durability you put
into defacing that blank space is
going to be worth it in the end."
It's a far-reaching, generalized
philosophy - one that, as Zinn
states, can be applicable to any
mode of work or life. In essence,
if you erase the staying power of
what's in front of you, you're free
to be true to the moment and, by

Zinn draws his detailed chalk creations all over Ann Arbor public spaces.

extension, yourself.
"If you stand there, worrying
about what you should do with
the tools in front of you, you'll do
nothing, and nothing will hap-
pen," Zinn explained. "If you just
remember that what you're about
to do is, in fact, pointless and
impermanent and ethereal, it can
be the catalyst that makes work
possible. It pushes you to realize
that you should just be enjoying
the process of creating."
The process has let Zinn
develop a style of sidewalk art
that, when pressed, he could only
describe as "kind of a Rorschach
test" - a Rorschach test admin-
istered by the disjointed nature
of Zinn's medium: concrete side-
walks.
"The sidewalk is actually not
a blank canvas because it has
all these wonderful specks and
pebbles and holes and cracks, so
what you're really doing is you're
connecting the dots," he said.
"It's a free association experi-
ment where you stare at all those
pebbles and bits and pieces of gum
until you see something, and you
just draw what you see."
That almost otherworldly con-
cept of subject matter presenting
itself in moments of visual inspi-
ration is one that Zinn references
when describing how he came
across Sluggo, the green alien-like
creature that inhabits many of his
drawings.
"The first time that I thought
he appeared was as a drawing of
a kid. But, no offense to this kid,
his head was strangely eggplant-
shaped," he recounted. "So, I set
out to draw this happy, dancing
child, and this happy, dancing
child has an aborigine-shaped
head thatI then had to deal with. I
tried to wing it."
It didn't work.
"Every time I tried to put eyes
on this head, it looked terrifying.
It was just an unhappy-looking

mutant child, and I kept having to
erase and erase and erase," Zinn
said. "So, out of sheer annoyance,
I drew eyes above his head. Fine.
There. Done. And as soon as I did
that, he was OK with what he
was."
Since that fateful first encoun-
ter, Sluggo has become Zinn's most
recognizable character and also
one to which ("at risk of sounding
too arty") he feels he's developed
an emotional attachment. But if
there's a place where the green
mutant won't be found, it's a wall.
Walls aren't public property
and, as a result, are out of bounds
for Zinn's artistic pursuits.
Because Ann Arbor has such open
policies about usingsidewalks and
other collective University spots
for open art, Zinn never really felt
the need to endeavor into graffiti
territory.
Ann Arbor law allows artists
like Zinn to use chalk on public
sidewalks and walkways as long
as they aren't a disturbance to
anyone walking down the street
or going to work. Graffiti, tradi-
tionally associated with images
of hooded hooligans gleefully
marauding around at night with
cans of spray paint close at hand,
is a different story. It's usually on
private property, a lot more per-
manent and therefore more likely
to be fined.
"The only issue I have with
graffiti is that it puts people on
edge when they look at me," Zinn
said. "I've had a few run-ins with
police officers who had to make
sure that it was indeed chalk I was
using, which, interestingly, is how
I found out chalk was legal."
Of course, Zinn adds, graffiti
puts local business owners in abad
mood because they are required
by the city to remove it from their
property after-the-fact or face
the risk of ever-heftier fines. As a
result, usually the only backlash
Zinn ever receives for his work

has to do with drawing on walls
classified as private property.
"It's nice to be working in a
medium where I actually don't
have to hide in darkness and
break the law," he said. "Because,
technically, it's a performance art.
I can even put outa hat for tips -
something I don't think you can
do with spray paint."
And he's done it in the past, the
first time collecting a grand total of
$3.35.
"It was a bunch of teenagers
who pointed out the lunacy of
drawing outside with a hat on your
head instead of on the ground," he
said.
Zinn speaks at length about
coming to terms with the per-
ceived irrelevance of his medium
and art. Unlike traditional forms
of expression, he never gets to
see the reactions of his intended
audience. He draws on the side-
walk and walks away. To some
degree, he describes, there's a cer-
tain freedom that comes with not
looking back.
"It's reassuring to think that
because you don't know how it's
going to be perceived, or who's
going to see it or what effect it's
going to have on them, the pos-
sibilities are endless," he said.
"Even though I don't cure can-
cer, I can draw something on the
path that someone takes to work
on a job that affects someone who
does. And even if they hated what
I do, that might be the catalyst."
When the discussion shifted
back to his time as a student in
Ann Arbor, Zinn seems a little bit
more at ease. He laughed briefly
and further explained his deci-
sion to not study design.
"That was my college self mak-
ing a decision," he said. "Think-
ing back, ifI was absolutely being
honest, I'd say that college self
was using that decision to ratio-
nalize not wanting to take the bus
to North Campus."

Nowthat everyone has
more or less survived
the tornado that is
welcome week, it's time to get
back to business. Summer 2013
proved to be
one of the
most memo-
rable in hip-
hop history.

grabbing projects, while Ken-
drick Lamar set the hip-hop
world on fire with his lyrical

as the summer officially winds
down, though, hip hop continues
to make news. I've included here
a couple of the bigger topics over
the last couple weeks to keep
you updated. Recognize.
Drake andthebuildup to
Nothing Was the Same
Following in the footsteps
of Jay-Z and Kanye, Drake has
been ultra tight-lipped about his
upcoming album, Nothing Was
the Same, set to release Sept.24.
As the date approaches, however,
details have started to appear. The
excellent,'80s-wedding-sounding
second single "Hold On, We're
Going Home" findsDrake harken-
ingback to his "Find Your Love"
sound, while the streetsingle, "All
Me," with 2 Chainz and Big Sean
is boasting at its finest.
Still, as a secretly diehard Drake
fan (I love his music, but at points,
he's just too easy to hate), I'm wor-
ried that NWTS can't live up to
Drake's last album, the momen-
tous Take Care. On that record,
Drake somehow managed to
pour his heart out without being
cheesy, effectively makingup for
his mediocre debut. Take Care was
genuine, dark, cohesive and epic.
Come on, the album cover is Drake
sitting pensively alone at atable
holding agoblet.
So far, Nothing Was the Same
has beentrue to itsname:Almost
nothing resembles Take Care.
And this is great, but is it wrong
to want "Headlines" instead of
"Started From the Bottom," ortto
feel somewhat skeptical when the
album artwork is an oil painting
of baby Drake facing old Drake
against a light, blue sky? This is a
classic case of judging a book by its
cover, I know. Then again, artists
will - and should - evolve. The
tracklist forNothing Was theSame
shows features from only Detail
and Jay-Z, a promisingsignothat
Drake's lyrical ability will shine
more this time around. There's a
song called, "Wu-Tang Forever,"
which makes me want to squeal,
and the opening track, "Tuscan
Leather," supposedly flipsothe
same Whitney Houston sample
three dfferent times, once for each
verse.
Challenged by up-and-comers
and giventhe spotlight byveter-
ans, Drake is in the prime of his
career and on the top ofhis game.
Let's hope he pulls through. Who
knows? In a fewyears,Nothing

Was theSamecouldbe the start
of an epic sentence ending with,
"after Drake released his third
album."
Lil WaynereleasesDedication5
As someone who appreciates
quality hip hop, I have a really
hard time enjoying Lil Wayne's
recent string of abysmally bad
music. This year's IAm Not a
Human BeingIIwas anail in the
coffin of sorts for Wayne's stand-
ing as a legitimate rapper. I actu-
ally had to take multiple breaks
in between songsato process the
vulgarity of Wayne's lyrics.
Where Wayne has always
shined, however, is on mixtapes.
From the legendary Da Drought
series to the prequels ofDedica-
tion S, Wayne has a knack for
picking the best beats around and
absolutelyspazzing. On Dedica-
tion 5, Wayne manages to avoid
regressing even further, which,
at this point, should be deemed a
victory.
The tape is 29 songs, which is
15 songs too many, but it's clear
that Wayne is serious about rap-
ping again. The Weeknd shows up
for a classic feature on the open-
ing track, while T.I. kills three
separate songs. The best appear-
ance, though, goes to Chance The
Rapper, who, as of rightnow, has
early-Drake-levelhype surround-
ing him. His whimsical rhymes
and nasally flow on "You Song"
make the track a highlight and,
surprisingly, Wayne keeps up.
It's easy to see Wayne's influence
on Chance's style, and I can only
imagine the excitement Chance
felt when he got a phone call
requesting him to be on the tape.
A much bigger question
remains: How is Lil Wayne going
to continue to grow? So far, his
attempts at changing have been
painfully clear: releasing a rock
album, signingeverybody to
his label and even becoming a
skateboarder. Wayne's one-time
contemporaries, Kanye West,
Jay-Z and, even to an extent, Rick
Ross, have all noticeably evolved
their art in attempts to be ground-
breakingor, atleast, relevant.
Wayne has done no such thing; in
fact, his two most famous prote-
gs, Nicki Minaj and Drake, have
already eclipsed him in growth.
Lil Wayne isn't going away, but
sooner than later a time is going
to come when people stop caring.
Wake up, Weezy. The game isn't
yours anymore.
Finally, my favoriteesongs of
the summer:
Big Sean, "Beware" feat. Lil
Wayne & Jhene Aiko; Ciara,
"Body Party"; Drake, "Hold On,
We're Going Home" feat. Majid
Jordan; Drake, "The Motion"
feat. Sampha; Earl Sweatshirt,
"Sunday" feat. Frank Ocean; Fan-
tasia, "Without Me" feat. Kelly
Rowland & Missy Elliott; J. Cole,
"Forbidden Fruit" feat. Kendrick
Lamar; Kanye West, "Bound 2"
feat. Charlie Wilson; Wale, "Bad"
feat. Tiara Thomas

From Page 1B
"It's not a shady area to me,"
Boening said. "Not from what I've
been around."
After Boening leaves to look for
a different shooting location on
State Street, a handful of Universi-
ty students meander through, Ins-
tagramming photos and sketching
in their notebooks. As the sun
shines and people pass happily on
the street, it certainly doesn't look
like the sinister space some make
it out to be.
But the night tells a slightly dif-
ferent story. With Necto Night-
club and Scorekeepers Bar and
Grill just across the street, a slew
of interesting characters can be
found smoking (possibly ciga-
rettes) just outside the clubs. A
man asks a group of bar-hoppers
for money, while a girl crosses to
the other side of the street to avoid
the scene.
There are groups of panhan-
dlers crowded on various cor-
ners on both sides of East Liberty
Street. At around 11 p.m., as the
party at Necto starts to populate
and people congregate around the
alley, it's easy to see why business
owners would be worried about
the effect the area would have on
their business.
But after the groups move into
Necto, the street is relatively quiet.

are out only pass through on their
way to or from Washington Street.
For Naser Ras, a manager at
Hommus Express, and Doreen
Sun, a manager at TK WU, the
alley poses no problems to their
businesses, which operate primar-
ily during the day.
Sun, who has been a manager at
TK WU for 10 years, said though
she personally has never had bad
experiences with panhandlers
or rowdy teenagers, the owner
of Rocky Mountain Chocolate
Factory, which closed at the end
of March and was located right
next to the alley, used to complain
about the effects of the alley on
her business.
"We have alot of homeless that
come to our store to buy food, but
I don't think it's a problem," Sun
said. "It doesn't bother us."
The space previously occupied
by Rocky Mountain Chocolate
Factory is currently unoccupied,
but will soon house Tamaki, a cus-
tom sushi restaurant.
Ann Arbor City Councilmem-
ber Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1) wrote
in an e-mail interview thatthe city
has worked closely with human
service organizations in the past
couple years to combat homeless-
ness in the area, as well as provide
support to those facing addiction
and mental health issues.
In a2011interviewwithAnnAr-
borcom, Briere said "there's a
certain lawless nature to the
ara" Now how~evehinshave

improved and Briere even receives
proposals to hold art exhibits in
the alley.
"A couple of years ago, I was
hearing that there were people in
need of help - and in denial that
they needed help - who demand-
ed money from those just walking
through," Briere wrote. "Have the
alleys changed? I think so."
A complex public space
Briere and others have taken
strides to ensure that all residents
and visitors of Ann Arbor feel
safe in the streets. But for some,
the very fact that the alley makes
people uncomfortable is reason to
celebrate it.
Over the years, Nick Tobier, an
associate professor in the School
of Art & Design, has watched the
State Street area transform from
a place that housed mostly local
businesses, to one overrun with
national chains and corpora-
tions. Tobier, whose work focuses
on public art, said Graffiti Alley
offers the city a refreshing break
from the corporatized America
that can be found in any town.
"I think that Graffiti Alley
helps contribute to the sense of
an eccentric place," Tobier said.
"It's really necessary in a complex
city to have places that are, I don't
mean deviant in a bad (way), but
I mean slightly apart from main-
stream consumer culture."

NICHOLASWILLIAMS/Daily

LSA junior Waseef Ahsan and LSA senior Saif Hassan take a rest from the heat.

panhandlers and teenagers who
make some local business owners
and residents uncomfortable are
a direct result of the State Street
changes. He said it's inevitable
that people will gravitate towards
"unbranded corporate-logo spac-
es" like the alley.
That's not to say Tobier endors-
es crime. On the contrary, he
and many other artists advocate
for the space as a way to make
sure everyone in the city has the
chance to say something or to

way.
"I'm all for safe streets; I don't
want people to feel vulnerable,"
he said. "But teenagers feel vul-
nerable. They need to feel like
there's a place where they can
leave their mark or they can do
their own thing without some-
one shouting at them."
With the rejection of the pro-
posed art millage on last Novem-
ber's ballot - which would have
provided funds for public art
installation projects such as

by the suspension of the Percent
for Art program, the future of
public art in the city remains
unclear.
In Tobier's eyes, Graffiti Alley
can help fill the void and pro-
vide Ann Arbor with a necessary
place for expression in a public
setting. He said Ann Arbor has a
ways to go in improving itspublic
art scene in all different scales.
"The reflection of a complex
society is a complex public space.
You need all types of things to be

"

LSA juniors Han Yu and Jose Gomez admire the alley on a late night stroll.
