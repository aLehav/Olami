After 21-percent drop in
2009, endowment climbs back
$600M to $6.6 billion in 2010
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
After a severe 21-percent drop in its value
last year, University officials announced yester-
day afternoon that the University's endowment
rebounded somewhat in the pastyear,growing12.3
percent.
The growth, from $6 billion to $6.6 billion as of
June 30, 2010, begins the recovery from last year's
$1.6 billion loss. However, the figure leaves much
more to gain back before the University's long-term
portfolio is back to its 2008 level when the endow-
ment reached an all-time high of more than $7.6
billion.
The return is higher than was expected by Uni-
versity officials like Tim Slottow, the University's
executive vice president and chief financial officer,
who told the regents in June that he was predicting
an 11.5-percent return on the endowment invest-

Raise will bump 'U'
president's base
salary to $570,105
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
DailyStaffReporter
The University Board of Regents
voted unanimously at its monthly
meeting yesterday afternoon to give
University President Mary Sue Cole-
man a 3-percent salary increase.
The raise took effect Aug. 30,
2010. Coleman's previous base
salary was $553,500, while her
total compensation package was
$783,850. The 3-percent raise will
result in a $16,605 increase in Cole-
man's base salary, bringing it to
$570,105.
Aside from her base salary, Cole-
man received a $100,000 retention
bonus, $75,000 in deferred compen-
sation, $24,500 in retirement pay
and $30,850 in supplemental retire-
ment pay in 2009.
Coleman also has an account for
herbusiness-relatedtravelexpenses
and other operations. In addition,
she is given a car and is provided full
use of the President's House at 815
South University Ave.

Coleman accepted a 4-percent
raise in 2008, but requested in 2009
that the regents not give her a merit-
basedsalaryincrease.In2007,Cole-
man received a 3-percent raise, but
decided to donate the money back to
the University.
According to data published by
The Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion last January, Coleman was the
sixth-highest paid university presi-
dent in the country in 2009.
The Board of Regents Person-
nel, Compensation and Governance
Committee conducted a perfor-
mance review before awarding this
year's salary raise.
At yesterday's meeting, Regent
Andrew Richner (R-Grosse Pointe
Park) read the regents' recommen-
dation for the raise. Speaking on
behalf of the regents, Richner said
Coleman's performance as well as
market trends supported the deci-
sion to award the raise.

addition to extending our personal
gratitude for a job well done, is rec-

HIV/AIDS in Africa
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
Sujal Parikh, a fourth-year
student at the University's Medi-
cal School, passed away Tuesday
night in Kampala, Uganda after
being injured in a motorcycle
accident.
Parikh was researching pedi-

atric HIV and AIDS at the Joint
Clinical Research Centre in Kam-
pala as a Fogarty International
Clinical Research Scholar.
Elizabeth Petty, associate dean
of the University's Office of Medi-
cal Student Education, said in a
phone interview that Parikh was
a "very inspirational, visionary
young man who was incredibly
humble and incredibly generous
with his time."
Petty wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that Parikh "will be dearly
missed" by the medical school
community.

"Sujal was such an exceptional
human being - a true humanitar-
ian," Petty wrote. "He was tire-
less and selfless in his passionate
efforts to address social injustice
and health disparities globally. He
touched us all so profoundly with
his insightful words, visionary
thoughts and generous actions."
Petty wrote that Parikh had
a passion for social justice and
international health, which could
be seen in the variety of organiza-
tions he participated in. Parikh
partook in the Student Advisory
Board for Physicians for Human

Rights, the Student Advisory
Committee for the Global Health
Education Consortium and the
American Medical Student Asso-
ciation's AIDS Advocacy Network
Steering Committee.
Originally from Dallas, Texas,
Parikh got his undergraduate
degree in public health and neu-

year of medical school.

ments.
The return is on par with what
several other universities across
the country have experienced,
putting the University - with the
seventh largest endowment in
American higher education and the
second largest of a public university
- in the top quartile of investment
returns for the year.
The University of Virginia
saw a 12.5-percent return on its
endowment this year, helping to
offset its 21-percent loss last year.
Similarly, Harvard University
gained 11 percent on its endow-
ment this year, which helped
make back losses it suffered in
2009 when it lost 27.3 percent of
its value. And Yale University saw
an 8.9-percent bump this year on
its endowment, which fell by 24.6
percent last year.
Presenting this year's per-
formance results in a report on
behalf of the University's Board of
Regents Finance, Audit and Invest-
ment Committee, Regent Kather-
ine White (D-Ann Arbor) boasted
about the University's investment
returns.
"We have continued to increase
our endowment distribution to
support University operations year
to year," White said. "Last year we
made $256 million in distribution
back to the units, up from $244
million in fiscal year 2009 and $227
million in FY'08."
White went on to say that over
the last five years, the endowment

programs. The previous three meet-
ings were in bowl games.
"We are excited about playing a
regular-season game in the state of
Texas, a region of the country where
we have traditionally recruited,"
Brandon said in the a statement.
"Our goal is to get as many Michi-
gan fans to the game as possible to
witness this matchup of traditional
powers."
Associate Athletic Director for
Mediat and Public Relations David
Ablauf said the Alumni Association
is already planning on having alum-
ni tours and plans are in the works
to make sure Michigan fans who
live in Texas will be at the game.
On his weekly radio show, Michi-
gan coach Rich Rodriguez said that

has contributed $1.1 billion back to
support University operations.
"Our long-term portfolio per-
formance over the last 10 years is
in the top quartile in investment
returns for other endowments
and we look forward to continuing
strong investment returns given
our strategic and prudent fiscal
policies coupled with our aggres-
sive cost containment measures,"
White said.
In an interview following yes-
terday's meeting, Regent Andrea
Fischer Newman (R-Ann Arbor)
said the growth of the endowment
is essential to keeping higher edu-
cation affordable.
"I hope we keep growing it
because we need to keep growing
it," Newman said. "We need to do
all we can to offset the cost of edu-
cation and one way to do that is
through the endowment."
Regent Julia Darlow (D-Ann
Arbor) echoed Newman's satisfac-
tionwiththe endowment'sgrowth,
calling it terrific.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman joked in an interview that
she's much happier with this year's
results than last year's.
"I feel a lot better this year than
I did this time last year," Cole-
man, said laughing when asked
for her opinion on the investment
returns.
Coleman also said she has a
great deal of faith in the Universi-
ty's investment team - ledby Chief
Investment Officer Erik Lundberg.
"They have special expertise
that they have been able to gener-
ate for us consistently ... in the top
performance," Coleman said.
tickets for the game would be split
50-50 between the schools.
According to an Alabama press
release, "The game will mark the
fourth year of a five-year agreement
between Cowboys Stadium and
ESPN to bring a top college football
game to North Texas during the
Labor Day weekend to start the col-
lege football season."
Past games featured Brigham
Young University against Oklahoma
in 2009 and Texas Christian Uni-
versity and Oregon State earlier this
season. LSU and Oregon will play at
Cowboys Stadium in 2011.
"It will have been the fourth time
that (Cowboy Stadium is) hosting
an early-season game," Ablauf said.
"They had approached Michigan
and it's agreat place for us to play."
Alabama is the defending BCS
national champion and spent most
of the season so far ranked at No.
1, before the team was defeated by

In an interview after yesterday's
meeting, Slottow said that while
he was happy with this year's per-
formance, it is more important to
consider investment returns in the
long term and not focus solely on
returns from year to year.
"Weexpectto makemoneysome
years and we expect to lose money
other years," Slottow said. "Any
one year is really meaningless.
What really matters is the five- and
10-year performance because we
have long-term commitments for
expenses and supporting faculty
and students."
To protect itself from unpredict-
ability in the market, University
officials implemented a seven-year
rolling average in 2006 that aver-
ages the endowment's most recent
28 quarterly statements to deter-
mine the value with which the
endowment's payout is calculated.
The long-term approach of the cal-
culation helps smooth out peaks
and valleys in the endowment's
value - protecting the University
from value volatility, as it did when
the endowment values across the
country fell last year.
The University's Board of
Regents also approved a proposal
over the summer that will lower
the rate of endowment spending -
taking it down a half percent from
a 5-percent annual distribution to
a 4.5-percent annual distribution.
The measure is being implemented
gradually to ensure that the total
dollar amount distributed does not
fall during implementation.

As of now, Ablauf said officials
haven't discussed whether Michi-
gan and Alabama would meet
beyond this game. The Wolverines
lead the all-time series, 2-1. Michi-
gan was victorious in the last meet-
ing, which was a 35-34 win in the
2000 Orange Bowl.
"We have such tremendous
respect for Michigan: their school,
their outstanding tradition, and
their following," Alabama Athletic
Director Mal Moore said through
a statement. "It's a terrific opportu-
nity for our student-athletes and our
entire program, in addition to being
a great benefit in recruiting. It's yet
another chance for our university
to be showcased on a national stage
early in the season at a terrific sta-
dium."

A federal judge has overturned
the murder conviction of a man
serving life for a 1986 killing in a

For medical marijuana
patients, dosing is DIY

More research
necessary to
determine effects of
drug on conditions
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
In 2008 Michigan voters legal-
ized the medical use of marijuana,
but unlike most other medicines,
marijuana does not come with a
standard dosing procedure.
The responsibility of dosing
the medicine falls to the patient
because the effects of marijuana
vary depending on the individ-
ual, the condition being treated
and the type of marijuana used.
Until scientists do more research
on the individual compounds in
marijuana, their effects on medi-
cal conditions will remain unpre-
dictable.
Dennis Hayes, one of the found-
ers ofthe Ann Arbor Medical Mari-
juana Patient Collective (A2M2PC)
and a lawyer who specializes in
medical marijuana legislation, said
that even veteran marijuana users
don't have a way to calculate impor-
tant effects such as timing, intensi-
ty and duration.
Mike McLeod, another found-
er of A2M2PC, said experts may
be able to devise an optimal dos-
ing approach for marijuana in
the future, but it won't be pos-
sible without federally-supported
research on the individual com-
pounds in marijuana. Until then, he
said, patients will have to navigate
the dosing landscape themselves.
McLeod has worked with a
doctor in California who has a lot
of experience with medical mari-
juana. They have made efforts to
compile dataon what works best for
different patients, but McLeod said
the situation is "just a real politi-
cal hot potato," adding that more
research is needed, but it won't
come until there's a change in fed-
eral drug policy.
Dr. Daniel Clauw, director of
the University's Chronic Pain and
Fatigue Research Center, helped
write the University Hospital's
ANNIVERSARY

ored Al and Judith Guskin, two
University alumni who listened to
Kennedy's speech as graduate stu-
dents and later helped spearhead
the formation of the Peace Corps.
In her speech on the Union
steps, Coleman recalled the time
she visited the White House as
a finalist for a science competi-
tion and met Kennedy. It was the
March after he established the
Peace Corps, and she said she
thanked him for his work.
"I could not have imagined that
one day I would have the privilege
to stand literally at the birthplace
of the Peace Corps and thank the
students and faculty whose enthu-
siasm made JFK's vision such a
powerful reality," Coleman said.
In addition to commending the
University community for its ser-
vice, Coleman also talked about
University alum Tom Hayden, a
well known 1960s activist who
covered Kennedy's speech as edi-
tor in chief of The Michigan Daily.
"Some say I was the voice of

my generation, but I say I was the
Guskins' mouth piece," Hayden
saidinaninterviewafter the event.
Hayden also spoke at the Hatch-
er Graduate Library last night
in front of a crowd of about 200
people about his involvement in
the creation of the Peace Corps,
activism in the 1960s and the role
of community service in today's
world.
During his time as editor of The
Daily, Hayden printed a letter by

medical marijuana guide - acom-
prehensive summary of how mari-
juana reportedly affects patients
with the qualifying medical condi-
tions specified in Michigan's medi-
cal marijuana law. He said because
marijuana hasn't undergone the
same level of testing that "classic
drugs" have, marijuana is "more
like a nutritional supplement."
Clauw, who has given writ-
ten certifications to some of his
patients, said without more knowl-
edge of the intricacies of how the
drug works, physicians don't know
what dose to recommend to their
patients. He also said the strength
and purity of the medicine varies
depending on where it comes from.
Mike Meno, the director of com-
munications for the Marijuana
Policy Project - the organization
responsible for drafting Michi-
gan's medical marijuana law - said
that substantial research has been
done on marijuana, but none of it
has been done through the Federal
Drug Administration because mar-
ijuana is a schedule I drug under
the Controlled Substances Act and
is therefore held to a "ridiculous
standard."
The Drug Enforcement Agency
has put marijuana, along with
GHB, heroin and LSD, in the sched-
ule I drug classification, the most
restrictive out of the five drug clas-
sifications listed under the CSA.
The category consists of drugs
that have a high potential for abuse
and no accepted medical use in the
United States. In 2001 the DEA
denied a petition to make marijua-
na a less restricted classification,
'citing its lack of medical use as the
primary reason.
Meno disagrees with DEA's
decision and said several studies
confirm marijuana's safety and
medicinal properties.
"It's a blatant lie for the federal
government to say (marijuana) has
no medical efficacy," Meno said.
"There are patients who are ben-
efiting from it right now."
According to Dr. Rebecca Van
Dyke, a professor in the Depart-
ment of Internal Medicine at the
University and a specialist in gas-
twnenterology and hepatology, the
lackoffederallysupported research
the Guskins, in which the couple,
inspired by Kennedy's words, out-
lined their idea for the Peace Corps
and asked readers to write in with
their opinions. Hayden said he was
surprised at the number of people
who responded to the letter.
"It was one of those mysterious
moments where people at the mar-
gins felt they mattered," he said.
Later on during his time at the
University, Hayden and a group
of other students sent a series of
questions about global policy to
each presidential candidate in the
1960 election. One of the questions
asked about the candidates' posi-
tions on a "national youth corps
serving in constructive peacetime
activity abroad in place of military
service."
Kennedy's questionnaire was
hand-delivered by one of the stu-
dents when the future president
visited campus shortly before his 2
a.m.speech, according-to Hayden.
Though he played a role in
establishing the Peace Corps,
Hayden said he felt a strong desire
to stay in the United States to
focus on improving social issues at

home, instead of going abroad.
Hayden went on to be one of the
founding members of Students for
a Democratic Society and author
of the Port Huron Statemen and
later Hayden later a California
state senator.
In his speech, Hayden also
discussed the current economic
crisis. He suggested that service
organizations today could func-
tion like the Federal Emergency
Relief Administration and the
Civil Works Administration dur-

on marijuana is not only because
of its schedule I status, but also
because it is an herbal medicine.
"The problem that we have with
marijuana and some herbal materi-
als is they have not undergone the
same level of controlled testing
and so we often can't give as good
information about how well will
this work, what are its side effects,
what might be reason to choose
this material over other material,"
she said.
Van Dyke - who said she warns
her patients against using marijua-
na because current research sug-
gests it may increase liver scarring
in patients with Hepatitis C or liver
disease - added that she thinks
the United States should change
the way it conducts drug testing so
agents like marijuana can be thor-
oughly studied.
Until more research is done on
marijuana, many new patients who
don't yet know how to dose them-
selves look to local collectives for
guidance.
Jim Cifor, owner of the Ann
Arbor Health Collective, said many
of the more than 1,500 patients
in the collective ask for advice on
what to buy. On the first visit, he
said many end up sampling a vari-
ety of products.
According to Cifor, certain
strains of marijuana are best for
specific conditions. For example,
Cifor has found that the strain
called Lavender works best for
patients with multiple sclerosis.
Arthritis patients like himself,
he said, benefit fron the collec-
tive's glycerin tincture - a liquid
extraction of the active canna-
binoids found in marijuana. To
use the tincture, patients put five
drops under their tongue and
then wait 20 minutes to see how it
affects them.
In addition to marijuana seeds
and tinctures, the Health Collec-
tive offers massage oils, lip balms,
topicalsprays, ointments and baked
goods, like their chocolate-dipped
coffee and cinnamon favored-
"canna cake" with cannabis cream
filling. Because of federal drug laws
and to avoid legal troubles, Cifor
declined to say how much his prod-
ucts cost.
ing the Great Depression and
create needed jobs. Expanding
community service programs
abroad, Hayden said, would also
contribute to shedding a more pos-
itive light on the United States.
Hayden also expressed his
approval for the Obama Adminis-
tration's $215 million increase in
"funding for the Peace Corps, but he
added that this figure is miniscule
compared to how much the United
States is spending on the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan, which will
drive the nation further into debt.
"I think the future of social
activism in the United States rests
very much with the Obama gen-
eration," Hayden said.
During yesterday's commemo-
ration on the Union steps, Julia
Darlow (D-Ann Arbor), chair of
the University's Board of Regents,
also commended the activism of
today's University students.
Kennedy's first cousin Marnee
DeVine also attended the celebra-
tion and said she is "thrilled that
international service remains such
a strong commitment on the part
of Michigan's faculty, staff."
Several speakers expressed

their hope of continuing to expand
the Peace Corps. Harris Wofford,
former Democratic U.S. Senator
from Pennsylvania and an archi-
tect of the Peace Corps, said it is
time to get serious about growing
international service.
"I'm perfectly ready to have the
University of Michigan continue
that leadership."

Purely shortsighted
State must fund Pure Michigan ad campaign
Many Michigan residents have enjoyed a laugh at the
cheesy Pure Michigan advertisements. But though the
ads - narrated by Michigan resident and actor Tim
Allen - can be easy to dismiss as a stunt, the campaign is credited
with spurring hundreds of millions of dollars in tax and business
revenue since it began in 2006. Last week, the Michigan legislature
voted once again to cut funding to Pure Michigan's already-slashed
budget. Spending needs to be cut to help keep the state's finances
in order, but Pure Michigan has been a positive contribution to the
state's economy. Restoration of Pure Michigan's funding is vital to

have horrible eyesight. My pre-
scription is close to negative six,
which means I can't read text
that's farther away
than five inches
from my face.
When I was about
seven years old, I
finally visited the
optometrist. I will
never forget com-
ing home with my
first pair of glasses
and seeing clearly VANESSA
with corrected
vision for the first RYCHLINSKI
time. I walked into ______
my bedroom and
there was carpet:
textured, patterned carpet. Maybe
it's hard to imagine, but I was fasci-
nated. I satdown andtouchedit, stuck
the tips of my fingers in, mashed it
around. How could I have not noticed
the floor that I walked and played
on every day? The fact that I wasn't
aware of this minor detail for so long
was shocking and strange.
Does your vision need correcting?
You probably have a cell phone on
you right now. Or maybe you're read-
ing this article from your laptop. Take
a look at it. What would you say if I
told you that some of the metal in your
device could be linked to the murder
of a family, a young man losing a leg or
the rape of a 10-year-old girl?
Here's a pair of glasses.
You may have heard about the
"blood diamonds" of West Africa.
What you may not know is that
there's a similar issue with so-called
"conflict minerals." The Democratic
Republic of Congo is rich in materi-
als such as tin, tungsten, tantalum
and gold, which are integral for the
production of cell phones, laptops
and other technology. The Congo

has been war-torn for more than 15
years. Those who committed mass-
genocide in neighboring Rwanda
joined the armed group FDLR (the
Democratic Forces for the Liberation
of Rwanda, in English) in the Congo's
eastern province of Kivu. The Con-
golese national military, which had
absorbed another former rebel group,
has had to fight the FDLR remaining
in eastern Congo. However, accord-
ing to the watchdog group Global
Witness, the Congolese military has
actually been working in tandem
with the FDLR to harvest these min-
erals and finance their respective
operations.
So the long and short of it is this:
The Congo has an abundance of
natural resources, a fact that several
armed groups have exploited to the
point of causing even more blood-
shed as they collect the spoils. Global
Witness has estimated that around
5.4 million people have been killed
in the last 10 years as a result of this
situation, and the country has been
additionally dubbed by the U.N. as
"the rape capital of the world," with
the number of rapes estimated to be
colossal - in the hundred thousands.
Death and rape aside, it's impos-
sible to project the statistics for how
many people whose lives have been
displaced or irrevocably altered by
this prolonged conflict. One example
is the countless men who work in the
very dangerous crude mines. They're
either coerced under threat of vio-
lence or are simply natives to the
region and are attempting to make a
living. All are subject to heavy taxes
by the armed groups that control the
area, and severe injuries are a com-
mon occurrence.
The recent Financial Reform Act
signed by President Barack Obama
included a mandate that companies

must provide information on whether
their materials were obtained from a
conflict region. This transparency is
a step in the right direction, though
it's probably going to be difficult to
track every gram of conflict material
- which often switches hands as many
as seven times, as stated by Time mag-
azine in July 2009. Nevertheless, it's
necessary that electronics companies
take responsibility for their merchan-
dise and audit their supply chains so
that consumers have the option of
buying conflict-free products.
Public should be
aware of the origin
of their goods.
The University obviously has a lot
of great technological resources. As
such, our campus should take the
initiative of putting in place poli-
cies to purchase conflict-free equip-
ment. We are now able to see the
carpet, and it's something we walk
on every day. Many of us break or
lose our phones because we can just
buy a new one, not thinking that the
new device could possibly, as stated
by Congolese Bishop Nicolas Djomo,
contain "a drop of Congolese blood."
It's not only essential that the origin
of these tainted materials become
increasingly transparent over time,
but that we also pay attention to this
information, so that as students and
as consumers, we can make mindful
decisions in the future.

Michigan's tourism industry.
In mid-September, The Detroit News
reported that the state legislature approved
a cut to Pure Michigan's funding from $17
million in 2010 to $5.4 million for the 2011
fiscal year. This is the second consecutive
year that the program's budget has been
cut by nearly $12 million, down from a high
of $28 million in 2009. The projected $5.4
million doesn't provide sufficient money for
a fall 2011 campaign, according to Travel
Michigan, the state's tourism department.
On Oct. 2, The Detroit News reported the
legislature voted down a proposed $10 mil-
lion funding increase to the program. This
makes plans for full-scale winter and sum-
mer advertisement campaigns financially
impossible.
Pure Michigan boasts some impressive
results. According to Travel Michigan, last
year the campaign brought over 2 million
tourists to the state and over $600 million
to hotels, gas stations, restaurants and other
Michigan businesses. For every $1 that the,
state spent on the program, Travel Michi-
gan estimates a $2.23 return in tax revenue
in 2010. In 2009, the return reached as high
as $5. These figures show that Pure Michi-
gan is a good investment. The state legisla-
ture needs to reconsider decreasingsupport
for such a successful program.
It's difficult to understand how the legis-

lature can justify cutting support of a flour-
ishing campaign. Though state spending has
been slashed across the board to balance the
budget, the most recent cut to Pure Michi-
gan is too severe for a program that greatly
benefits the state's economy. Other sectors
of the budget, including the inflated correc-
tions budget - Michigan spends about 20
percent of its general fund on corrections
each year, which is much higher than the
2010 national average of 7 percent, according
to a June 28 Newsweek report - should have
taken greater hits before Pure Michigan.
On Monday, Gov. Jennifer Granholm
proposed allocating $25 million from an
expected $100-million increase in state
tax revenue to Pure Michigan, according
an Oct. 11 article in The Washington Post.
With this increase in funding, the regional
winter and national summer advertise-
ments could be back on track. The Michi-
gan legislature should support Granholm's
proposal and allow Pure Michigan to con-
tinue helping our state.
Pure Michigan is an undeniable benefit
to Michigan's tourism industry and gen-
eral economic future. Its importance and
continued survival should be considered
seriously by the legislature. An increase
in funding is necessary, whether by Gran-
holm's proposal or by some other means.

ANDREW LAPIN|I
Don't blame the band

The unsung educators

As a former member of the Michigan March-
ing Band, I was disheartened at the inaccurate
information presented in Roger Sauerhaft's
recent viewpoint regarding what students call
the "You Suck" chant (Ill-timed 'You Suck'sucks,
10/13/2010). In writing this piece, Sauerhaft suc-
ceeded in perpetuating a long-standing miscon-
ception regarding the band's rolein the infamous
football Saturday tradition. I'd like to take the
opportunity to clear some things up.
The song the band plays when an opponent's
third-down conversion fails isn't called "You
Suck." It's a Jerry Bilik arrangement of the 1933
song "Temptation," originally popularized by
Bing Crosby. University tradition dictates that
the band always play "Temptation" on fourth
down, regardless of score or any other fac-
tors. The rationale, you see, is that the other
team was tempted to convert downs but was
ultimately led away from temptation by our
defense. Recent games, much to the disdain
of the Wolverine faithful, have afforded less
opportunity to play the song.
The band also plays the song at every postgame
performance, accompanied by a famous percus-
sion routine. Following every performance of
the song is an arrangement of "Hawaiian War
Chant." The reason being, as every Michigan
fan should know, "you can't have one without
the other," as Michigan Stadium announcer Carl
Grapentine informs the crowd every week. Stick
around after the game sometime and watch the
band play. They're pretty good.
The words "You Suck," as you might guess,
CAMERON NEVEU |

are not a part of the original song's lyrics. Infact,
the band is specifically instructed to never sing
"You Suck" when the song is played, because it is
the band's job to maintain a respectful demeanor
toward our opponents. (Members sing"Oh,Yeah"
instead.) This is the same reason they, along with
every Big Ten marching band, always play the
other team's fight song during the pregame per-
formance. Bands are a prominent public symbol
of a university and you will be hard-pressed to
find a college band that actively encourages nega-
tive behavior amongits fanbase.
So where did "You Suck" come from? The
same place where Yost Ice Arena's "See Ya"
cheer came from: the students. Some years
ago, the football student section started taking
creative liberties with the cheer. As the trend
caught on, people not unreasonably began to
assume it was the band's doing. Professor Scott
Boerma, the current marching band director,
once related a story of an athletic department
official telling him they "really love the 'You
Suck' cheer." That is to say that actual Univer-
sity employees think that the band is encourag-
ing 100,000 people to tell the opposing team
they suck. These officials are wrong.
If you don't like the "You Suck" cheer, don't say
it. Revert back to the song's original lyrics: "You
came, I was alone / I should have known you
were temptation." Start a movement to get other
students to do the same. But don't blame the
band. Itisn't the band's job to tell you what to say.

Writing my first paper for
Great Books 191 was sort
of like asking me to do
quantum physics
with an abacus.
No matter how
many times I read
Socrates, no matter
how nuanced my
outline was and no.
matter how many --
times I scoured
SparkNotes - -
praying the writ- TYLER
ing prompt would
magically be JONES
answered under
the "Themes,
Motifs & Symbols"
section - I knew my graduate student
instructor would ultimately show my
final copy to other GSIs to elicit a few
laughs.
When I received my grade, it was
hard for me not to chuckle a bit along
with them. But I wanted to do better
- this was material that I desperately
wanted to understand. So I went to
office hours. And then I went again.
And again. Writing papers for that
class turned into three-week long
exchanges between me and my GSI.
The entire time, I kept thinking, "This
guy has got to be getting tired of me!"
When the semester ended, I did bet-
ter than I could have imagined when I
walked into discussion section on the
first day. But more valuable than the
letter grade I recieved is the lesson in
writing I learned while toiling over
my paper with my GSI in the Depart-
ment of Classical Studies lounge.
Though I sometimes like to attribute
this to my dogged work ethic, I know
it was my GSI who taught me how to
bring my writing to the next level. I
will certainly never forget the hours
he devoted to helping me to get better.

But how many of us can say that? GSIs
are on the front lines of our education.
While professors usually simply lec-
ture, GSIs teach. Sometimes it seems
students lose sight of that.
Before you write this column off as
a sad attempt to get in good with my
Stats 250 GSI before midterms, let's
consider who GSIs are. In the 2007-
2008 academic year, the University
employed 2,234 GSIs, according to
University statistics. GSIs are not
career teachers. Many of them have no
interest in pursuing a career in educa-
tion. They are simply people looking
to pay their way through world-class
graduate programs.
Now, don't get me wrong. I, too,
have endured GSIs whose grasp of
English is. questionable at best. I
have also labored through discus-
sion sections with GSIs who never
once looked up from their notes. So
to those GSIs who don't quite under-
stand what the "I" in their title stands
for I say, consider a new line of work
after graduation.
But what about those truly out-
standing GSIs? I mean the ones
whose class you actually enjoy
attending. Where are their Arthur
F. Thurnau awards for "commitment
to and investment in undergradu-
ate teaching?" Why didn't my Great
Books GSI get a Golden Apple award
for his ability "not only to dissemi-
nate knowledge, but to inspire and
engage students in its pursuit," as the
website puts it?
GSIs are in the trenches of our edu-
cation at the University. They pick
up where the professor left off or, in
many instances, fell short. It seems to
me that these students (let's not for-
get that we're talking about students)
deserve some recognition for their
contributions to the rich community
of academic exploration and discovery

at the University. Though GSIs are eli-
gible to win a few outstanding instruc-
tor awards, I think there's something
more valuable to be earned. That
undergraduates acknowledge and
appreciate the work done by GSIs and
the effort some of them put forward to
enhance our education is sometimes
the greatest award possible.
GSIs are on the
front lines of our
eductation.
GSIs don't come up in conversation
much. Let's be honest, no one signs
up for a class because of a tremendous
GSI. But why not? When my friends
couldn't grasp a concept in Great Books
last year, they went to see the GSI for
help. When I wanted help writing my
psychology paper recently, I didn't stop
by the professor's office for some point-
ers - I went to the GSI. Being able to
learn from a truly remarkable GSI far
exceeds anybenefits ofsittingin aclass
taught by a professor who has testified
before the Senate or has written a text-
book or two.
Learning doesn't happen in a lec-
ture hall with PowerPoint presenta-
tions and i>clickers. It happens in
some dingy graduate lounge with
poor lighting and the faint smell of
day-old coffee. Sitting with someone
who loves the subject matter and
wants to convey that same level of
passion and enthusiasm to you - that
is how learning happens.

hosting a theatrical Babel

teenage biopic

'Pentecost' explores
and breaks down

much more of you than you will
ever take the pains to learn of us,"
says Yas-
min, a char-
acter in the
Department Through Oct.17,
of Theatre Thurs. at7:30 p.m.,

min's words
challenge
the Western world to imagine
other nationalities in all of their
complexities instead of disregard-
ing them as names on a map. This
idea pervades the production,
which features extended dialogue
in Arabic, Bulgarian, Russian,
Turkish, Polish, Azari and Sinha-
lese.
"One of the themes of the play
is the Tower of Babel," said Music,
Theatre & Dance junior Emily
Berman, who plays Gabriella
Pecs. "You have all these char-
acters on stage speaking differ-
ent languages that the audience
doesn't necessarily understand,
but it's constructed such that the
audience is given the informa-

tion they need in English. It's this
beautiful story about people who
are very different ... meeting in a
place and connecting on the level
that humans are all the same in
some ways. It's very universal in
that way and it's been fun explor-
ing that."
Berman's character finds a
painting in an abandoned church
in the 1990s that might bridge the
gap between the Renaissance and
Medieval periods of art history.
As characters meet and interact
in the church, they must confront
personal attitudes toward art his-
tory, politics, religion and each
other's cultures in war-torn East-
ern Europe.
"The way this play works is that
it really gives you interest in what
exactly these people are saying
and what is going on. As the audi-.
ence learns about these charac-
ters, the characters are learning
about each other," Berman said.
David Edgar, the playwright
who penned "Pentecost," met
with the cast and crew last spring
and explained that audiences do
not need any prior understanding
of European and Middle Eastern
languages to see the play. Though
all vital information is delivered
in English, the linguistic cacoph-
ony prompts audiences to pay
special attention to gestures and
emotion, thereby overcoming the
language barrier the same way
the characters do.
"It gets to a point where it
doesn't matter what language
they're speaking. Because of the

way they're physically expressing
themselves and the connection
between the group as a whole,
the language barrier kind of dis-
appears and you're able to under-
stand," said MT&D senior Joey
Richter, who plays Oliver.
To prepare the cast and crew,
Director and MT&D professor
Malcolm Tulip, along with MT&D
senior Matthew Bouse, (the dra-
maturgist or reasearcher for the
play), gave the class some home-
work: The two set up a CTools
site that included information
about wars in Europe and images
of Giotto di Bondone's artwork, a
central subject in the show.
"There's been a lot of back-
ground work on everybody's
part," said MT&D sophomore
Allison Brown, who plays Yas-
min. "We've all worked really
hard on dialects and getting
accents down. We had our lines
said for us on the CTools site. My
character is Arabic and needs to
sound Arabic, without a doubt.
You do, absolutely, have to have
an understanding for it or else
the words would be meaning-
less."
Tulip made sure his production
team was completely immersed
in the time period and culture of
Edgar's piece in order to best con-
nect with the story.
"The dialogue between Mal-
colm and the cast was so stimu-
lating," said stage manager and
MT&D junior, Rachael Albert.
"They talked at length about the
meaning of different sections and

oftentimes the final realization
was one that neither party had
originally thought."
"We spent days in those initial
rehearsals not even getting up
on our feet but watching videos
of different cultures and the way
that they danced or the way they
spoke. The show is about the per-
ception of people," Richter said.
"Pentecost" challenged per-
ceptions of diversity and oneness-
behind the scenes as well.
"Costuming the refugees was
a unique challenge to this play,"
said costume designer Corey
Lubowich, and MT&D senior.
"While the group is very diverse
and come from different coun-
tries, it was important that they
were all wearing clothes and not
costumes. They aren't wearing
traditional ethnic clothing, but
real clothes (with clear influence
from the west)."
Lubowich's designs and the set
created by MT&D senior Margue-
rite Woodward mirror Edgar's
notion that cultural differences
are often just external. In an
unnamed country in continent
ravaged by conflict, Edgar's play
emphasizes human connections.
"The most amazing thing about
'Pentecost' ... was the theme of
universality of different cultures,
races, and religions across the
world," Albert added. "Stories
have common themes and mes-
sages world wide, and despite the
language barrier, everyone was
able to somehow understand each
other."

John Lennon has been scru-
tinized and dissected not only
more than any
other member of
the Beatles, but
perhaps more N
than any other NoWhere
figure in pop cul- Boy
ture. And why
shouldn't he be? At the
His cosmic, free- Michigan
wheeling perso- Weinstein
na is the gift that Company
keeps on giving,
even 30 years after his death. Len-
non's stature as poet, prophet and
revolutionary casts a long, dark
shadow over pretty much every-
thing that happened in rock music
since 1960.
Perhaps it's a testament to the
impenetrability of Lennon's legend
that his life has avoided the dreaded
"biopic treatment" for so long (TV
movies notwithstanding), though
we have been subjected to several
documentaries on the man as well
as - nauseatingly - two films about
his murderer. But now here is Sam
Taylor-Wood's "Nowhere Boy," a
dramatization of Lennon's early
years that tragically never gets
around to answering why it needed
to exist in the first.place.
Aaron Johnson ("Kick-Ass")
plays the teen as a troublemak-
ing smart-ass, a Cockney prank-
ster who, when asked to say "a
few words" at a party, rattles off
a string of profanities. His brash-
ness is the best thing about the
movie. Seeing Lennon unfiltered
and raw like this instead of as pop
music's holy-man savior is quite
refreshing, considering Johnson's
portrayal is likely the closest thing
we'll get to the truth. Lennon's pre-
rogative was always "goof off first,
play music second." His "Nowhere
Boy" self's chief concern isn't to.
imagine there's no heaven; it's to
keep his guardian aunt from find-
ing out he skipped schooh
But the hyperlocal scope of the
film wears thin quickly. Rarely
does "Nowhere Boy" move its
hero beyond the three-block radi-
us that contains his aunt's house
(where he lives) and his mother's
(where he frequents, trying to fig-
ure out where she's been all his
life). For her part, Julia Lennon
(Anne-Marie Duff, "The Last Sta-

tion") is an emotionally unstable
woman who showers her son with
borderline Oedipal love upon his
discovery of her close proximity.
The relationship between her and
her sister (Kristin Scott Thomas,
"Gosford Park") is in many ways
the crux of whatever emotional
point the film is trying to make,
but their interactions are mostly
sidelined until the third act, at
which point the plodding dra-
matic structure somehow turns a
real-life tragic event into a deux ex
machina.
Meanwhile, the segments in
which Lennon scrapes together

loads of.fun, but only achieve mild
success. Yes it's cool to see The
Quarrymen start to make a dent

icon's youth goes
'Nowhere' fast.
in the scene as Liverpool's hip-
pest garage band, but we don't get
enough of a look at the bandmates
or their performances to feel like
we've witnessed an often-over-
looked portion of Lennon's life.
Thanks to a lack of chemistry, his
budding friendship with a young
Paul McCartney (Thomas Sang-
ster, "Bright Star") feels, of all
things, forced. And the obligatory
"this is George" scene serves no
purpose other than to wink at the
camera.
Despite the movie's short-
comings, Taylor-Wood and
screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh
("Control") should be applauded
for even daring to tackle such a
narrowly focused depiction of the
music world's most sacred cow.
But if we've learned anything
from Lennon, it's that you can't
expect a half-hearted attempt to
gain success just because no one
was brave enough to try it before.
Say what you will about Julie Tay-
mor's "Across the Universe," but at
least it had the guts to commit to
a wholly unique approach to the
Beatles. By comparison, "Nowhere
Boy" is the music-biopic equiva-
lent of the "Star Wars" prequels:
an unnecessary origin story for a
cultural icon.

DailyArts Writer
You know when a football team
with a traditional offense sud-
denly lines up in some crazy for-
mation before the snap, and the
whole stadium
buzzes at the
possibility that
some big trick Life AsWe
play is coming
up? These gim- KNW it

es dream up in
moments of bril- Warner Bros.
liance, but when
the "trick" is given away before the
snap, it almost never works out.
"Life As We Know It" begins
as if something about it could be
special, but gives away its big "sur-
prise" way too quickly - in the
trailer, in fact.
Before we step into the theater,
we're informed that the parents
of adorable toddler Sophie die in
a car accident, and that's why her
Godparents - Holly (Katherine
Heigl, "The Ugly Truth") and Eric
(Josh Duhamel, "Transformers
2: Revenge of the Fallen") - are
brought together to help raise
her despite their disdain for each
other. Before they fall in love, that
is. (Oops! Spoiler alert!)
Katherine Heigl in a movie about
raising a baby she didn't expect to
have with a man she initially finds
repulsive ... if this synopsis feels
familiar to you, you're not alone.
Once the unusual circumstances
at the outset is past, you have defi-
nitely seen the rest of this movie
before.
The film's conflict stems from

"Seriously?I got impregnated by Seth Rogen, haven't I been through enough."

life-alteringexperiences thatthrow
both Heigl and Duhamel's previous
plans to the wind, forcing them to
overcome their differences for the
sake of Sophie. But, since the audi-
ence is completely aware that this
big shock is coming, the movie not
only loses some of its edge and abil-
ity to surprise, it makes the entire
story less meaningful.
Most of the credit for this film's
shortcomings goes to its poorly
conceived trailer, but some blame
has to fall on the storyline itself,
which - after the surprise that we
knew was coming happens - feels
like almost every other Katherine
Heigl movie.
While Heigl and Duhamel are
supposed to portray a set of sympa-

thetic characters, once we realize
what their "surprising" situation
actually is, we don't really feel bad
them. Eric, a token playboy, chang-
es little to nothing about his "me-
first" lifestyle until the end, and
actually has more random hookups
because of the baby.
Holly, while pressed for time
at her bourgeoning pastry shop,
has no trouble providing for little
Sophie, whose deceased parents
left her and Eric with a complete-
ly paid for, "MTV Cribs"-style
mansion. The only expenses our
heroes have to worry about are
food and diapers, and the time
they spend in their late friends'
palace makes their experience
of raising a child feel more like a

comedic, sex-filled vacation than
a serious attempt at not screw-
ing up a kid's life. There's enough
comedy in "Life As We Know It"
to make it bearable, but that's not
saying much.
What bad coaches and bad
artists don't realize - and why
their trick plays don't work - is
that you have to master the basic,
"easy" plays before you try pulling
out something huge. This movie
has a potentially poignant starting
point that hasn't been done before,
but it becomes clear as the movie
goes on that "Life As We Know It"
is a traditional, easily understood
(and defeated) concept. It's just
run out of an unconventional for-
mation.

ket and salary data the committee
reviewed."
Richner cited a laundry list of
achievements Coleman accom-
plished throughout the past year
- including growth in the Univer-
sity's endowment, the successful
renovation of Michigan Stadium
and the smallest increase in tuition
in the past two decades. In addition,
Richner noted that Time magazine
ranked Coleman as one of theo best
college presidents in the country.
When Richner finished reading
the statement, Regent S. Martin
Taylor (D-Grosse Pointe Farms)
turned to Coleman and asked,
"What are you going to do next?"
After the regents approved the
salary increase, Coleman thanked
the board.
"Thank you very much," she
said. "I very much appreciate that.
I love working with this team, and
I appreciate the support because
without every single part of it, it
wouldn't work."
In an interview after the meeting,
Regent Andrea Fischer Newman
(R-Ann Arbor) explained why she
voted for Coleman's salary hike.
"I think it's deserved," Newman
said. "She's forgone an increase the
past few years, and the University
could (afford) it. I think it's more a
sign of recognition than it is about
the money."
PROGRAM
From Page 1A
of graduate school, serve overseas
for the required 27 months and then
return to campus to finish their
degree in either one semester or one
year, depending on the specific pro-
gram.
Master's International programs
already exist at about 50 to 70 other
schools. But the School of Social
Work is the first school of its kind
to participate in this Peace Corps
program, according to Pompe. He
added that the School of Education
program "is also fairly unique."
"Michigan is not only breaking
ground on its own end, but it's also
moving forward in a unique way
(with) the PeaceCorps's partnership
with universities as well," Pompe
said.
The Master's International pro-
gram allows students to do service
work abroad that is more directly
related to their areas of study than
regular Peace Corps volunteers, said
Bill Nolting, assistant director of the
Education Abroad Office at the Uni-
versity's International Center.
The three schools decided to
take part in the program in order to
attract students with "a strong inter-
national interest," Nolting said in an
interview last night.
However, the University's part-
nership with the Peace Corps to edu-
cate graduate students is not entirely
new.
Currently, the University has
Fellows/USA programs in both the
School of Natural Resources and
Environment and the Gerald R. Ford
School of Public Policy. Fellows/USA
is a program which allows return-
ing Peace Corps volunteers to apply
to a participating master's program
in hopes of receiving a fellowship
thanks to their service overseas,
according to Pompe.
Students who get into the pro-
gram at the School of Natural
Resources and Environment are

awarded with a full scholarship,
while those who are accepted into
the Public Policy program are given

Regent Julia Darlow (D-Ann
Arbor) echoed Newman and Rich-
ner's sentiment in an interview after
the meeting, saying Coleman was
very deserving of the pay raise.
"She didn'ttakeonethispastyear,
and the 3 percent we thought was
reallyareasonable amoun,"Darlow
said. "I definitely support it."
Coleman's raise comes amid a
2.8-percent cut in state appropria-
tions to public universities earlier
this month. In addition, the regents
voted in June to raise tuition by 1.5
percent for in-state students - the
smallest tuition increase approved
in over two decades. In addition, the
regents voted in June to approve a
3-percent tuition increase for out-
of-state students.
In addition to her official role at
the University, Coleman serves on
the Board of Directors for Johnson
& Johnson and Meredith Corpora-
tion. The most recent compensation
figures for her service on the two
boards are from 2008.
In 2008, Coleman received
$202,631 in total from Joinson &
Johnson.Ofthatsum, approximately
$95,000 was given in cash, nearly
$100,000 was given in stock options
and therest came intheformofother
compensation -like giftsato charity.
Coleman earned $144,067 for
serving on Meredith Corporation's
board in 2008. Of that amount,
$10,000 was given in cash, $42,000
was in stock options and the remain-
ing $92,000 was given in option
awards.
a $10,000 award, Pompe said.
There are currently 10 students
in the Fellows/USA program at each
of the University's participating
schools, according to Pompe.
Students who are accepted into
the Master's International program
are also given monetary incentives,
according to Nolting.
"Certainly that's one of the
aspects of the program and the
Fellows program as well, that the
schools make a commitment to offer
every conceivable type of financial
support," Nolting said.
Pompe said it was Nolting who
first reached out to the Peace Corps's
Washington D.C. headquarters to
discuss the possibility of the joint
program.
"They decided to use the momen-
tum of this 50th (anniversary) as
well as Peace Corps's new vision of
strengthening the partnership with
utiiersities to trete 'these three
new programs," Pompe said.
As aresultofthenewprogram, he
said the eace Corps office on cam-
pus will now be recruiting not only
University undergraduates to join
after they graduate, but it will also be
reaching out to students from across
the country who are interested in
goingtograduate school at one of the
three schools.
"We're drawing now on the
strengths of those three schools
within a national academic focus,"
Pompe said. "So anyone looking at
a school of social work will immedi-
ately see that Michigan is on the top.
They'll see that this program exists
as well."
The University's Peace Corps
office hopes to extend the Master's
International program to graduate
programs at other schools within
the University as well, said Pompe,
who served in the Peace Corps in
Namibia from 2006 to 2008 and is
also a master's student in the School
of Information.
"As Sargent Shriver originally
said, Peace Corps would be work-

ing hand-in-hand with universities
and we're hoping to build toward
that original goal, and Peace Corps's
committed to that as well," he said.

Regents laud 'U' support of Armstrong

In statement,
regents say campus
must stay 'vigilant'
against intolerance
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The University Board of
Regents commended the cam-
pus community's response to the
recent attacks against Michigan
Student Assembly President Chris
Armstrong at its monthly meeting
yesterday.
At the meeting, Regent Julia
Darlow (D-Ann Arbor) read a
statement on behalf of the regents.
"As the elected governing body
of the University of Michigan, we
want to express our unequivocal
support for the decisive way the
University has responded to the
unfortunate situation," Darlow
said.
While the statement did not
specifically mention Andrew
Shirvell, an assistant attorney
general for the state of Michi-
gan who has recently spoken out
against Armstrong, it indirectly
called attention to his acts of dis-
crimination.
"Looking ahead, we will
remain ever vigilant to unaccept-
able displays of intolerance," she
continued. "At the University
of Michigan, we often speak of
the Michigan Difference, those
unique attributes that set us apart.
Today, we appreciate the values
that are common to all of us."
Shirvell has gained national
attention for his criticism of Arm-
strong. On his blog, called Chris
Armstrong Watch, Shirvell criti-

cized Armstrong for his "radical
homosexual agenda."
Before the University's Depart-
ment of Public Safety banned
Shirvell from University grounds,
Shirvell protested at multiple
events that Armstrong attended
and spoke against Armstrong dur-
ing an MSA meeting - calling for
the president's resignation.
In his monthly comments to
the regents yesterday, Armstrong
thanked the University commu-
nity for its response.
"The support the University
has expressed is incredibly hum-
bling for me and has motivated me
to keep moving in my service to
the student body," Armstrong said
at yesterday's meeting. "I would
not be here if it were not for the
University of Michigan and the
reaction the University has taken
reignites my faith in this institu-
tion."
In a statement released yester-
day, the Michigan Civil Rights
Commission - a government
body that investigates alleged acts
of discrimination - condemned
Shirvell for his actions, The Asso-
ciated Press reported.
In the statement, the MCRC
said Shirvell's "conduct should
not be tolerated from anyone, let
alone a public official responsible
for representing all people equal-
ly."
Last month, Armstrong filed
a personal protection against
Shirvell in a Washtenaw County
court. According to an Oct. 13
AnnArbor.com article, Shirvell
requested that Judge Nancy Har-
ris recuse herself from the case.
Harris's sister, State Rep. Alma
Wheeler Smith (D-Salem), has
openly criticized Shirvell and
Shirvell alleges that Harris would

not be able to objectively rule on
the case.
Harris will rule on the personal
protection order on Oct. 25.
REGENTS APPROVE $3M
MORE FOR CRISLER
REVAMP
The regents unanimously
approved an additional $3 million
for renovations to Crisler Arena
at their meeting yesterday and
authorized the project for bids
and awarding of contracts.
At their July meeting, the
regents approved a schematic
design for the renovations. The
project will include numerous
structural and safety upgrades for
the 43-year-old arena.
The original plan, passed by
the regents in January, called for
all the seats in the lower bowl of
the arena tobe replaced, the aisles
widened and handrails added in
order to make the arena comply
with regulations from the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act.
The arena's roof will also be
replaced and asbestos will be
removed from the building. A new
electrical system will be put in
place, and the heating and ventila-
tion systems will be replaced.
Safety updates include new fire
detection, alarm and suppressions
system, a smoke evacuation sys-
tem and emergency lights.
The plans approved in July
also called for the band section to
be moved to the north side of the
arena and the student section to
be relocated to the west side.
The new plan, approved yester-
day, calls for the same changes to
the upper bowl of the arena.
"Due to the availability of fund-
ing and desire to replace all the

seating within the arena at this
time, the Athletic Department
wishes to add $3,000,000 to the
project budget so that the full
replacement of the upper bowl
seating can be included in this
project," Athletic Director David
Brandon and Tim Slottow, the
University's executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer,
wrote in a letter to the regents.
The project is budgeted at
$23 million, and construction is
expected to be completed in the
winter of 2012.
SIMPSON CIRCLE PARKING
STRUCTURE RENOVATIONS
APPROVED
The regents also unanimous-
ly approved renovations to the
35-year-old Simpson Circle Park-
ing Structure on the medical cam-
pus at their meetingyesterday.
The renovations will reassign
about 470 parking spaces, cur-
rently designated to staff, for
patient and visitor parking for the
new C.S. Mott Children's and Von
Voigtlander Women's Hospital.
The parking structure will
be repainted, directional signs
will be added and changes to the
entrances and exits of the garage
will be made. A new pedestrian
bridge connecting the hospital
with the parking garage will also
be built.
In a letter to the regents, Slot-
tow and Ora Pescovitz, the Uni-
versity's executive vice president
for medical affairs, wrote that
the relocation of staff parking
spots will be included in the Park-
ing and Transportation strategic
plan. The plan also calls for more
commuter parking lots on North
Campus.

Blue faces first real test in No. 9 UNH

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan hockey team's
trip to New Hampshire has been
six years in the making.
The Wildcats played the Wol-
verines to a 4-4 tie exactly six
years ago today.
Michigan
coach Red Beren-
son admitted he
doesn't like going at UNH
to play games on Matchup:
the east coast, Michigan 2-0-
but when New 1, UNH 1-1-0
Hampshire was When: Satur-
in Ann Arbor, day 7:05 P.M.
Berenson prom-
ised them Whttemore
return game in Center Arena
the future. And
on Saturday No. 3
Michigan will take on the Wildcats
at Whittemore Center Arena.
The Wolverines handled Bowl-
ing Green last weekend and blew
a 4-0 lead to tie Mercyhurst in
the season opener. But No. 9 New
Hampshire will be the first real
test of the young season.
"Mercyhurst was the first game
of the year for both teams, and we
got our jitters out," junior defen-
seman Brandon Burlon said this

week during practice. "It's defi-
nitely going to be a test early in
the year ... We're going to have to
embrace the challenge."
New Hampshire graduated its
top scorer from last season, Bobby
Butler, but 14 of its top 16 scorers
return.
It showed its offensive ability
last weekend, getting nine goals
from nine different players in two
games against No. 4 Miami.
For Michigan (2-0-0 CCHA,
2-0-1 overall), shutting down the
Wildcats' transition game will be
the first priority.
"The team we're playing is a
great transition team," Berenson
said. "That's their strength, tran-
sition and attack, so if we can do a
good job in that area it will help."
Stopping the transition will be
harder than usual, as Michigan
will play on its first Olympic size
rink this season. Olympic ice is
13 feet wider than a normal rink,
creating more space for players to
spread out, especially in the neu-
tral zone.
"As a defenseman, you have a
lot more time." Burlon said. "The
forwards aren't on you as quick as
they usually are on a regular sheet
of ice.
"You don't get hit as much. But

by the same token, there's a lot
more room for the forwards to use
and gain speed. So it's a little bit of
a give and take."
The Wolverines haven't had suc-
cess in previous East Coast trips.
The past two years, they have lost
both games to Boston University
on the road. In 2007, Michigan lost
7-2 to the fifth-ranked Terriers,
and the following year, Michigan
scored two goals in the third to tie
the game, but gave up a late goal to
lose.
Despite the long trips and the
unfamiliar teams, the players don't
treat this game any differently.
"It's usually the first real road
trip and it's usually in the begin-
ning of the year so it's fun to get
the team together as bonding in a
way," senior forward Carl Hagelin
said. "It's fun to play some of those
teams.
"They're usually ranked high
and always skilled guys."
NOTES: Sophomore forward
Kevin Lynch, who hurt his shoul-
der in Tuesday's game against
the USNTDP, skated in practice
today with no contact. Berenson is
"anticipating he will be OK to go."
... Senior forward Matt Rust, who
suffered a lower body injury last
weekend will play Saturday.

Stachel gives 'M' comeback victory

MEN'S SWIMMING ND DiVING
Wolverines strive to .
meet high standards

By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
It must have been something he
said.
Despite outshooting Purdue
(2-4-1 Big Ten, 6-9-2 overall) and
having the clear offensive advan-
tage during the first half on Thurs-
day night
in Ann PURDUE 1
Arbor, the MICHIGAN 2
Michigan
women's soccer team went into its
halftime talk down 1-0. The Wol-
verines had missed six chances on
corner kicks in the half.
"It's been that way a bit this
year," Michigan coach Greg Ryan
said referring to missed opportu-
nities. "We're getting good chanc-
es but we're just not putting them
away."
Still without a Big Ten vic-
tory, the Wolverines (1-1-2, 6-2-
4) looked to Ryan and focused on
leaving with a win.
"I just said, 'Girls, you're doing
everything right, but you've got to
be more determined to get in the
box and score a goal,' " Ryan said
after the game.
That simple piece of advice
worked, as the Wolverines quickly
illustrated their determination to
get their first Big Ten victory.

senior captain Clare Stachel said.
With less than eight minutes
left in the game, freshman Meghan
Toohey sent the ball up the right
side of the box, resting right at the
feet of Stachel. Easily beating the
Purdue defender, she buried the
ball along the right post, tallying
her first goal of the season and
securing a win for the Wolverines.
The victory was certainly a
team effort, as Michigan used
much of its bench - including its
freshmen - throughout the game
to try and spark some action on
the field.
"Our freshmen are matur-
ing and we're becoming a deeper
team, so I'm able to use my bench
more," Ryan said. "The freshmen
and the upperclassmen that came
off the bench, I thought really
added to the energy we had on the
field. That's something we haven't
had in a couple of years."
The Wolverines head to Bloom-
ington on Sunday for a match
against the Hoosiers, continuing
conference play and kicking off
the first of three road games.
"We really are just looking for
more Big Ten wins," Stachel said.
"We have lost one, tied two in the
Big Ten and as long as we just keep
winning, we're looking for that
trip to the NCAAs."

Senior Clare Stachel scored the winning goal in Michigan's 2-1 victory Thursday.

Just 56 seconds into the sec-
ond half, freshman forward Nkem
Ezurike fed off of a quick pass
from senior forward Amanda
Bowery, quickly putting Michigan
on the board.
"We knew that we had to give it
our all the second half," Ezurike
said. "It came quickly, which was
a great thing for us."
It was the third time this season
that Ezurike had buried the game-

tying goal for the Wolverines. On
the two other occasions, however,
neither team ended up capitalizing
during overtime, resulting in two
ties.
But going into overtime for
the fifth time this season was not
something the Wolverines wanted
to do.
"It's getting far into the season.
We can't keep tying. We can't lose.
We need to put these goals in,"

By ANDREW HADDAD
Daily Sports Writer
In recent years, the Michigan
men's swimming and diving team
has been defined by star power.
Peter Vanderkaay won four
NCAA championships before
graduating in 2006. His little
brother, Alex Vanderkaay, won
two. Thirteen-time All-American
Andre Schultz and 2009 National
Swimmer of the Year Tyler Clary
paced the team last season, lead-
ing the Wolverines to a seventh-
place overall finish at the NCAA
Championships.
This year is a different story.
Schultz and Clary have gradu-
ated, and the Wolverines don't
seem to have the same type of
superstars ready to replace them.
In addition, the team is extremely
young, with just eight returning
seniors to go along with 17 fresh-
men, many of whom are expected
to contribute.
It may be a rebuilding year for
the Wolverines.
But Michigan coach Mike Bot-
tom disagrees. While the team
probably won't win as many
individual championships as in
recent years, he says, it is also
more balanced than usual, which
should compensate for the lack of
star power.
"Losing Tyler and Andre is
definitely tough," Bottom said
on Thursday. "But the team has
been training extremely well. If
we keep improving the way we
are, there shouldn't be a drop-off
from the last couple years."
The closest this team has to
a star is junior Dan Madwed, a
seven-time All-American him-
self. Madwed won Big Ten titles
in four separate events last sea-
son, and he plans on showing his
versatility even more this season.
"My goal is to do whatever
coach Mike wants me to do,"
Madwed said. "I understand that
we have a lot of guys now who do
the same things I do, so my goal is
to be wherever Mike needs me to
be and help the team as much as
possible."
Bottom views Madwed as one
of the three leaders of the team,
along with senior captains Neal
Kennedy and Chris Douville.
Kennedy and Douville both
began their careers as walk-ons.
"They're both great captains,"
Bottom said. "Neither of them
were highly recruited, butthey've
fought their way up the ladder.
They can look at the freshmen
and say, 'Look what we're doing.
We're captains now.' They're
great examples of the blue-collar

culture we have here. Whether
they're a top recruit or a walk-on,
our swimmers come in here and
battle their way to the top."
With such a young team, that
work ethic will be the key to
whether the Wolverines live up to
their high standards.
"I've never coached a team
that's improved quite so quickly
as we have," Bottom said. "Part of
that is exactly because we have so
many young swimmers here who
are excited about being here and
learning fast. Youth and inexperi-
ence isn't always a bad thing."
Michigan's 17 freshmen repre-
sent the largest recruiting class
in the program's history. The
most hyped of the bunch is Kyle
Whitaker, the 2010 National High
School Swimmer of the Year and
No. 1 recruit in the country. He's
expected to be a major contribu-
tor this season.
Several other freshmen have
been receiving buzz, such as dis-
tance specialist Sean Ryan, who
will be going to the world cham-
pionships in Dubai in December,
and butterfly swimmer John
Wojciechowski.
"(Ryan and Wojciechowski)
have both been training well,"
Bottom said. "Wojciechowski
especially has been flying under
the radar a little bit, but I think
he's going to come in and surprise
people."
Despite the high turnover from
last season, the team's strongest
and weakest events appear to be
the same as usual. The 500-m
freestyle, 200-m and 400-m
individual medleys, and the long
distance events are traditional
Michigan strengths and seem to
be in good hands again.
Conversely, the diving team
has always been somewhat of a
weakness for the Wolverines. In
an effort to improve the program,
the school hired KZ Li in August
as the head coach of the men's and
women's teams. Li was the co-
head coach of the U.S. Elite Div-
ing Academy the pasttwo seasons
and, previously, Minnesota's head
diving coach from 1996 to 2003.
With Li on board, along with a
strong freshman class and lead-
ership from Madwed, Kennedy,
and Douville, Bottom sees no
reason why the team shouldn't
have performances similar to
years past.
"(Our goal) is to win all of our
Big Ten dual meets," Bottom said.
"I think we have a great shot at
winning the conference. If we
keep improving at this rate, we
can go toe-to-toe with anyone in
the country."

Iowa defensive end Adrian Clayborn is arguably the best pass rusher in the Big Ten. He's the
anchor of what Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez called one of the best defensive lines in the nation:

The Michigan Daily: You really jumped onto the scene in 2009,
what made the difference for you in your junior year?
Adrian Clayborn: I think just us as a d-line, we improved. Not
just myself. Just pushing each other, every play, every practice,
every drill. Things like that. That's what makes us better.
TMD: How good is this defensive line and defense as a whole going
to be in 2010
AC: I think the sky's the limit. It's up to what we do in camp.
If we put in the work that we know we can, I don't see why we
can't be the best.
TMD: Why did you decide to come back for your senior year? You
could have potentially been afirst-round pick.
AC: Just to finish what I started. I'd like to get my degree.
And just finish off the job. If I had left, I wouldn't have done
whatI needed to do in college. I just felt like there isn't enough
information for juniors to make their decisions. You see some
guys go and don't even get drafted. I don't want to throw out
names, but the quarterback from Ole Miss, Jevan Snead. To
not even get drafted, it wasn't his fault. But some guys don't
have enough information to make that decision. And I think
that's the biggest decision of your life.

TMD: People have compared you to Ndamukong Suh. Do you see
that?
AC: I feel like he's done his thing and he's made a name for him-
self. Let his name shine. We play two different positions. And
hopefully I can make a name for myself. I don't think its much
of a comparison because we play two different positions and it's
two different styles of play. At the same time, it's an honor to be
put in that category, because I watched him on film all summer.
And he's a great player.
TMD: Why did you watch him onfilm?
AC: Every summer, coach Ferentz gives us a couple of guys to
watch from last year, in their senior season. I watched Suh and
Brandon Graham. After watching Brandon Graham, he's an
incredible player. He goes hard every play. I watch for technique
and style. Just to see how they perform their senior year.and
what it took to do it.
TMD: What stood out about Graham?
AC: He just goes. He goes hard every play. He has some good
moves. But other than that he goes hard, and he gets to the
ball.
TMD: Last year seemed like the year of the defensive linemen in
the NCAA, a lot of guys were making plays. What do you think
ofthat?
AC: I think it's coming to the day in age, d-linemen used to just
hold up blocks and make linebackers make tackles, but now
we're the first line of defense, so why can't we make the tackles.
Like when we shed blocks and make the tackle. We're taught to
hit and shed. Why not make the tackle, we've done all the work
against the 350-pound offensive lineman.
TMD: Great pass rushers love hitting the quarterback. Is that
something you look forward to?
AC: That's the ultimate goal and that's the greatest prize. Work-
ing so hard to get around those big 0-linemen and when you
finally get to the quarterback you just want to deliver a real
blow. And take the trophy.
TMD: Did you see some of those big hits on film watching Suh and
Graham this summer?
AC: Yeah, definitely. Graham had a lot of them. And Suh, he's a
beast and you just have to work hard and get to the quarterback.
TMD: What's your go-to pass rush move?
AC: I like to use a combination, a little bit of speed and power
at the same time. I'm not that fast, but I feel like I'm explosive.
So maybe get them on their heels a little bit then blow past
them.

After losing to Michigan State for the third year in a row, the
Wolverines will look to bounce back this week against Iowa,
but it won't be easy. The Hawkeyes come to the Big House hav-
ing not given up a rushing touchdown yet this season. It will be
interesting to see how Michigan responds in wake of its first Big
Ten loss.

After the Michigan football team
dropped its first game of the season
last week to Michigan State, there's
an awful lot riding on the Wolver-
ines' matchup with Iowa.
Sophomore quarterback Denard
Robinson will get his chance to prove
that he can indeed tear up a Big Ten
defense - and a stout one at that -
while the rest of his team aims to
prove it can earn a signature confer-
ence win for the first time in Rodri-
guez's tenure in Ann Arbor.
One thing's for sure, though. The
Wolverines will have their work cut
out for them, as the Hawkeyes boast
the fourth-best defense in the coun-
try, allowing just 242 yards per game.
MICHIGAN RUN OFFENSE VS.
IOWA RUN DEFENSE
This category is where the best of
both teams clash, when an unstoppa-
ble force meets an immovable object.
Robinson is easily one of the most
exciting in the open field that college
football has seen in the last decade.
But if the Hawkeyes contain on the
ends well enough, then he may not be
a factor.
Iowa doesn't boast linebackers as
skilled as Michigan State, which held
Robinson back significantly more
than expected, as he had to settle for
five-, six- and seven-yard gains. He'll
have more potential for the big play
against Iowa, but a great deal of the
burden will beon the offensive line.
In the end there will be very few
ways to stop Denard Robinson. Look
for him to bounce back this week.
EDGE: MICHIGAN
MICHIGAN PASS OFFENSE VS.
IOWA PASS DEFENSE
Robinson will get his opportunity
for redemption this week against
the Hawkeyes after throwing three
interceptions last weekend. But
Iowa's pass defense is rated signifi-
cantly higher than Michigan State's,
so Robinson may have some trouble
getting started.
Iowa hasn't replaced cornerback
Amari Spievey, who was drafted in
the third round by the Detroit Lions
last April, but its secondary has been
everything that Michigan wishes it
was: effective.
The Hawkeyes' pass rush could be
what Robinson has to worry about
more, though, as Iowa boasts one of
the best defensive ends in the country

in Adrian Clayborn. If Clayborn gets
penetration, Robinson will be throw-
ing on the run all day, which doesn't
bode well for limiting mistakes.
This matchup, however, really
depends on Robinson and his poise,
which has been the question all week
for the Wolverines.
EDGE: IOWA
IOWA RUN OFFENSE VS. MICHI-
GAN RUN DEFENSE
The Hawkeyes are far from the
top of the Big Ten in rush offense.
They've experienced a ton of inju-
ries the past few years, especially to
star-in-the-making ballcarrier Jewel
Hampton. So, it's kind of been a rag-
tag group carrying the ball in Iowa
City.
That being said, the Michigan
rush defense has been nothing spec-
tacular either, as the Wolverines'
linebackers have underperformed on
several occasions and were torched
by Michigan State's dynamic trio last
weekend.
The load for Iowa falls into the
hands of Adam Robinson who is a low-
er-tier back in-conference. If Michi-
gan can fill holes like they failed to
do last week, then the Wolverines can
definitely shut this category down.
But that's a big if Sep

Daily Sports Editor
For Iowa football coach Kirk
Ferentz, like nearly every coach
facing Michigan in conference this
season, the goal is to keep up with
sophomore quarterback Denard
Robinson.
But after Michigan State held
him to 86 yards rushing - his low-
est total of the season - the formula
is out there to stop him. And since
Iowa boasts the second-best rush
defense in the nation, it could be the
season's toughest test for the speedy
signal caller.
Ferentz isn't so sure, though.
"We run OK on defense," Ferentz
told reporters during his week-
ly news conference. "I wouldn't
describe us as slow. But we don't
have anybody (with Robinson's)
speed."
The Iowa coach likened Rob-
inson's style to a similar Big Ten
dual-threat quarterback, Indiana's
Antwaan Randle-El, who now plays
receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
"When Indiana had Randle-El,
they ran a unique attack. And if
you've got a player like that, you're
smart to do that," Ferentz said. "My
guess is that Michigan will do that
for a long time."
The Hawkeyes, however, have one
of the Big Ten's most dynamic defen-
sive talents in defensive end Adrian

in the secondary and a few guys up
front, but we didn't rotate a lot of
guys at linebacker and that's some-
thing we have to look at more often
this week."
After struggling to play "gap-
sound football," as defensive end
Ryan Van Bergen described it last
week, the Wolverines will need to
stop the running game on first and
second downs if they have any hope
of forcing Stanzi into making bad
decisions.
But Stanzi improved greatly in
the mistake-making department -
only throwing two interceptions so
far and completing almost 68 per-
cent of his passes - while Michi-
gan's defense has been predicated
by big-play mistakes. Just last week,
the Wolverines gave up three long
touchdowns to the Spartans, some-
thing that can't happen if they hope
to keep Iowa's offense, full of talent
at receiver, under wraps.
Coming off of a tough loss, Iowa
may not be Michigan's ideal head-
to-head matchup, but the Wolver-
ines are determined to prove that
their mistake-filled game against
the Spartans last week is behind
them.
"I think we'll learn a lot," Rodri-
guez said. "A lot of what we're learn-
ing, we already kind of knew. ... We
know there's going to be some grow-
ing pains. We just have to minimize
them the best we can."

Junior defensive tackle Mike Martin has tallied 23 tackles this season along with 2.5 sacks.

Clayborn, who tallies nearly one
sack every game. Clayborn should
pose the most serious threat on the
pass rush Michigan has seen this
season, likely forcing the Wolver-
ines to double team him. That could
open up opportunities for the rest of
Iowa's skilled defensive line.
Wolverine redshirt sophomore
guard Patrick Omameh acknowl-
edged that the front four is very
talented but not necessarily that dif-

ficult to figure out.
"They're a sound defense,"
Omameh said last Monday. "They
won't throw a lot of different things
at you, but they're really good at
what they do."
That battle in the trenches on
both sides of the ball could make the
difference.
Iowa's offense isn't necessarily
the most powerful in the Big Ten,
middling in most offensive catego-

ries. But battle-tested senior quar-
terback Ricky Stanzi could very well
tear apart a Michigan defense that
has been thrown into the fire.
Rodriguez said Wednesday, how-
ever, that he could rotate more guys
on defense in hopes that someone
steps up and more players stay fresh.
"We've actually been talking
about playing more guys defensively
all year," Rodriguez said. "In the
last ball game, we played quite a few

As the second half of the season commences the Daily football beat steps back
and takes a look at the Wolverines' performance in the first six games of the 2010
season. And with a 5-1 record, there sure are a lot of things to be proud of. But at the
same time, in Michigan's loss to the Spartans last week, some glaring issues have
come painfully clear.
th Iowa on the docket, this week could send Michigan back down last season's

DEFENSIVE LIN

C for confusion here. This
is defensive coordinator Greg
Robinson's position group, an
area he took over after a very
disappointing 2009 season.
But instead of turning it into
a reliable part of the defense,
Robinson's linebackers are
still a liability. Senior Jonas
Mouton has been a bright
spot at times with some key
plays. Fifth-year senior Obi
Ezeh continues to struggle,

every time a linebacker makes
a play, it's overshadowed
by a missed assignment or

The unit has been the one
bright spot on a defense that
has allowed more than 450
yards per game to opposing
offenses, which ranks 112th

been a beast in the middle,

Roh, "That's just... stupid."

SPECIAL TEAMS

When Rodriguez asked
after the Massachusetts game
for any able-bodied student in
good academic standing to try
out for kicker, you knew the
situation is bad. The Wolver-
ines' kickers have only man-
aged two field goals in seven
attempts - good enough for
dead last in the Big Ten.
Seth Broekhuizen looks to
be the guy for now as scholar-
ship kicker Brendan Gibbons
has done nothing but disap-
point since he made his way
to Ann Arbor. And while no
one really knows why they're
missing so many field goals,
the coaches are still behind
them for the most part. So it
must be a mental issue.
Meanwhile, punter Will
Hagerup has experienced his

share of growing pains trying
to keep out of former Wolver-
ine Zoltan Mesko's shadow.
He may never be Mesko, but
he looks like his season is on
the upswing after last week's
loss to Michigan State, during
which he kicked a 62-yard-
er and had two inside the
20-yard line.
There's hope for the special
teams, but not much. Look
on the bright side though: At
least none of the
specialists have
blown a game
for the Wolver-
ines ... yet.

Out of 120 Football Bowl Subdivision teams in the NCAA, the
above graphic shows where the Wolverines rank in every major
statistical category. Check the yard markers for a visual idea of
how Michigan's offense and defense graded out statistically.
In case you didn't notice, there's quite a difference.
