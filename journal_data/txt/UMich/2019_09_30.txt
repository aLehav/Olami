Housing 
is 
an 
ongoing 
issue that continues to affect 
stakeholders in the Ann Arbor 
community. For students, it 
means pressure to sign leases 
in early fall, perhaps without 
a full understanding of their 
responsibilities 
as 
a 
tenant. 
The steady growth of student 
enrollment, an average 2.21 
percent in the past two years, 
exacerbates the issue.
Individuals such as Peter Allen, 
professor at the Ross School of 
Business and Taubman College 
of 
Architecture 
and 
Urban 
Planning, believe that students 
are an integral part to building a 
solution. In Allen’s business class, 
Real Estate Essentials, students 
are given the opportunity to 
do so. And together with the 
students from his class, in August 
Allen proposed the creation 
of a student-led development 
accelerator 
to 
address 
the 
housing crisis. 
Real Estate Essentials has 
always included a hands-on 
component. But recently, he 
has built a proposal to include 
the 
University, 
local 
non-
profits and public agencies in a 
development accelerator group. 
In a presentation to the Business 
School Dean Scott DeRue and 

Taubman Dean Jonathan Massey 
in late August, Allen presented 
the development accelerator as 
a joint effort and highlighted 
the role of his accomplished 
students as potential advisory 
team members. He identified 
four critical issues in Ann 
Arbor housing: sustainability, 
affordability, mobility and better 
neighborhoods. 
Allen believes that these issues 
can be addressed by transitioning 
publicly owned surface parking 
lots in the downtown area 
to 
become 
minimal 
public 
underground parking, introduce 
mixed-use developments with 
integrated affordable housing and 
encouraging public landowners 
not to sell but to become long-
term partners in development. 
Allen and other stakeholders 
are expecting a response from 
the deans in the coming weeks. 
Housing pressures aren’t only 
affecting students or Ann Arbor 
residents. Last November, about 
4,300 residents in the broader 
Washtenaw County area applied 
for 600 spots on the Ann Arbor 
Housing Commission’s housing 
choice voucher waitlist, which 
opened for five days for the first 
time since 2012. 

The Michigan Daily sat down 
with E. Royster Harper, vice 
president for Student Life at The 
University of Michigan, Friday 
afternoon to discuss the Sexually 
transmitted 
infection 
testing 
policy controversy, the recent 
climate 
strike, 
fraternity 
and 
sorority life housing complications 
with the transition to winter 
recruitment 
and 
Harper’s 
announced retirement from the 
University.
The Michigan Daily: After 
backlash from the University 
community, 
University 
Health 
Services reversed its policy so STI 
exams are once again covered by 

tuition through the health service 
fee. From your perspective, why 
did the University change the 
policy?
E. Royster Harper: I know it’s 
hard for students to believe, but 
when students give us feedback, 
and we hear it, that causes us 
to reconsider what it is we’ve 
done, and we’re quick to do that. 
So here’s our concern: We have 
two legitimate competing needs, 
keep costs of attendance down 
and make sure the students are 
getting the health care that they 
need. Part of the decision to keep 
the cost down was that insurance 
that most students have, were 
already paying for it. So the folks 
that were benefiting the most from 
the health service fee were the 
insurance companies because we 
were paying for stuff they would 
pay for. But students said, “Look, if 

there’s any chance that my parents 
are going to know (about STI 
examinations), then I’m going to 
be less likely to get the services.” 
We didn’t want anything to get 
in the way of students getting the 
healthcare they need. What wasn’t 
comforting 
enough, 
students 
didn’t believe it, whatever the 
rationale was, it was clear to us 
that some students would choose 
not to get tested. Our commitment 
is to make sure that our students 
are getting good health care. So 
once that was clear to us, we just 
said, “Okay, this is not the right 
decision for us”. So what students 
did is they helped us understand 
the impact in a way that we had 
not understood it before. That’s 
why we changed our minds.
TMD: 
Why 
did 
student 
activism work in this case?
Harper: I think usually when 

the University makes a decision, 
there are multiple things that they 
are trying to get accomplished. In 
this case, money and making sure 
the students get good health care, 
that it didn’t have a chilling impact. 
Students are seldom protesting 
about things that don’t matter. But 
lots of things matter. So what the 
University is weighing is when we 
consider everything, where do we 
need to be? Sometimes what we 
decide is, we can’t change. This is 
not one of those, because when we 
put everything together, it makes 
sense to change. I do think that 
sometimes all of us think if I just 
raised my voice, or I just protest, 
what I want, will occur. But when 
you are in a leadership role, you’re 
always weighing a lot of points of 
views and a lot of different facts.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Two professors involved in 
the intersection of artificial 
intelligence and mental health 
shared 
their 
work 
Friday 
evening at the Ann Arbor 
District Library in partnership 
with 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s AI Laboratory. 
Emily 
Mower 
Provost, 
associate 
professor 
of 
computer science and electrical 
engineering, 
and 
Melvin 
McInnis, professor of bipolar 
disorder and depression, are 
working together to develop 
computational 
methods 
for 
measuring 
mood 
symptom 
severity in bipolar disorder. 
McInnis is the director of the 
Heinz 
C. 
Prechter 
Bipolar 
Research Program, and Provost 
is a member. 
The panelists first discussed 
why they were involved in 
the project. Provost, who was 
always interested in human 
behavior and improving people’s 
lives 
through 
engineering, 
said she was excited to work 
at the intersection of human-
robot interaction and effective 

computing. 
“It gives me an opportunity 
not only to try to create new and 
really innovative algorithms, 
but when you put a human-
centered swing into AI, then 
you also have the opportunity 
to really join engineering and 

science,” Provost said. “To me, it 
seemed like a really interesting 
opportunity to do something 
meaningful to do engineering 
that had an impact on people’s 
lives. … We specialized and 
started working in emotion 
recognition, where the goal 

was to take in speech and try 
to quantify ambiguity that’s 
associated with how people 
express emotions, which was 
exciting.”

Then you make a decision 
about which one needs to prevail, 
and we do the same thing. We’re 
trying to balance the best interest 
of students, faculty, staff, and as a 
public institution, you’re weighing 
all those things. The points of view 
are valid, and the job is to weigh 
them and figure out in the long run, 
what’s best. What I love about the 
University is that we do respond 
when issues are raised.
TMD: International students 
began paying an additional $500 
fee this semester on top of tuition, 
and some have voiced displeasure 
surrounding the transparency of 
why this fee was instituted and 
what it will be used for. Can you 
provide some clarity on the issue?
Harper: The challenge with 
the international fee is that not all 
the needs and what the calls will 
be for those have been worked 
out. So we are in the process of 
trying to figure out, given these 
resources, how do they need to 
be deployed in a way that benefits 
international students? And so 

students, if I hear you right, some 
of them are asking, ‘What are you 
going to do?’ And the answer is, 
that’s part of the work we have to 
do. So some students might say, 
‘Well, then why are you requiring 
the fee if you don’t know?’, but 
what we do know is that there are 
needs for international students 
that are not being met, and we 
want to be able to meet those 
needs… The services that they 
need that might be unique to 
international students, that’s how 
the fee is going to be used. And we 
are in the process, then, of deciding 
what’s the best use, whether it is 
to help with internships, whether 
it’s a deeper, stronger orientation 
program, whether it is we need 
to do more send-outs where we 
actually go to the community and 
prepare students better for the 
transition, whether or not there 
are things that the International 
Center provides that they also 
will need. So there is an array of 
services that we want to make sure 
we have the resources to provide, 
so students have a fabulous 
educational experience here. But 
this is one situation where you’re 

trying to do both. You’re trying to 
make sure that the students’ needs 
are met, and we don’t want the cost 
to be so prohibitive that students 
can’t come. I think the challenge is 
for us, the administration, is if we 
stay open and allow international 
students to participate in the 
process of what would make the 
most difference to strengthen 
your experience here, then I can’t 
have the answer to exactly where 
it is the money’s going to go right 
now… So it’s much more of a give-
and-take process that we’re using. 
So, I’m glad we have the resources 
to make sure that international 
students have a really exciting and 
robust education experience.
TMD: Last week, students once 
again participated in a Climate 
Strike, joining strikers across the 
world to demand bolder action 
on climate change. Last year, 10 
demonstrators were arrested at 
the Climate Strike, and six of them 
just recently appeared at pre-trial 
for trespassing. How important 
is student activism to the spirit of 
the University, and what advice do 
you have for students who want to 
make their voices heard?
Harper: 
I 
think 
students 
protesting — and for me, protest 
means having a voice, whether 
you decide to have that voice 
with the sign or by sitting in — I 
think that’s critically important 
that the students think about 
what’s important to them, think 
about the kind of University they 
want to have because this is your 
University, and then give voice to 
it. I believe the climate work and 
the work we need to do around 
climate is going to change, but 
it’s going to change because 
students are talking about and 
advocating for right now. Here’s 
where I would pivot. It’s critically 
important that you have an orderly 
structure and organization. And 
if the time and if you choose to 
speak is in a building that closes 
at five, say, ‘Okay, I’ll be back in 
the morning to speak again’. This 
idea that I can speak my mind 
anytime, all the time, anywhere in 
any way, that’s where I think the 
fault lies. It’s not in the speaking 
of the voice, but doing it in a way 
that honors other voices, too. And 
to be quite frank, if you want me 
to hear you and you want me to 

think about what you’re saying, 
then you have to think about how 
am I doing that, in such a way 
that what’s so important can be 
heard. Some people speak for 
the theater of it, and sometimes 
students and community members 
speak because they’re really trying 
to have another point-of-view 
heard… So I think the strikes are 
important and I think the different 
points of views are important. 
The major changes I know about 
have come because somebody had 
the courage to open their mouth. 
There was a time when I would 
have had to sit in the back of the 
bus… So the issue is not in speaking 
the voice. The issue is not in the 
protesting. I think sometimes the 
tension comes when those who are 
speaking or want to have a voice 
don’t think about what the impact 
of that voice is on others. None of 
us listen, when we’re being yelled 
at. Very few of us listen if we are 
being called names.
TMD: 
With 
Winter 
Recruitment 
for 
fraternities 
and 
sororities 
beginning 
this 
year, some students have raised 
concerns regarding how this could 
create complications with finding 
housing. How does the University 
plan to help students if they find 
themselves without housing for 
the following school year due to 
rushing?
Harper: This is an issue that 
comes up for students all the 
time, this issue of, “Will I be able 
to find housing?” And so last year, 
before we put this in place, as part 
of the reason we started so early, 
we actually had staff in the office 
of Fraternity and Sorority Life 
do some work around housing. 
So housing is available, it will be 
available up until school starts.
 This place is never without 
adequate housing. So one of the 
things, we have changed the 
signup period in the residence halls 
with this in mind, so we have done 
that. And, we also last year, we, 
meaning the Office of Fraternity 
and Sorority Life, did some surveys 
to make sure that vacancies and 
housing is available for students 
further on into the term.

ILLUSTRATION COURTESY OF THE AUTHOR

ILLUSTRATION COURTESY OF THE AUTHOR

I 
used 
this 
print 
for 
a 
collaboration with a local apparel 
brand. I was excited when a 
friend reached out to me asking 
if he could print the design onto 
hoodies to sell, especially because 
it had a message behind it that 
was important to me. He later 

got back to me, saying his boss 
was hesitant about the print, that 
the Arabic was controversial and 
would exclude many customers, 
which I honestly found laughable 
and 
ironic. 
The 
text 
reads 
‘assalam ‘alaykum’ which literally 
means ‘peace be with you’ and 
is used as a formal greeting. 
Still, someone found the fact of 
the Arabic language inherently 
uncomfortable and controversial. 

I’m really grateful that I’m able 
to elevate my voice through art 
but can’t help being disappointed 
and even shocked that this kind of 
mentality persists. 
This design was initially a 
screenprint, created at the height 
of the ongoing Syrian Refugee 
Crisis of 2016. As a Palestinian 
living in the diaspora, and with 
close family ties to Syria, I felt 
compelled to create work that 

speaks to this humanitarian issue.
The text reads, in Arabic, 
‘peace be with you,’ a phrase 
often used when entering a room, 
before beginning a speech, or as a 
formal greeting. In other words, 
welcome.
Coupled with the symbol of 
intertwined arms centered on a 
full circle, this artwork symbolizes 
peace and acceptance of others 
despite perceived differences.

I’m a wolf of the streets, I 
smell your fear.
A bright sun looms over 
me, dressed up in some 
new clothes I had bought 
for the semester, I walk 
to class. Right on time, I 
make my way into Mason 
and lower the volume on 
my headphones. The halls 
are buzzing per usual and 
I sense an ordinary day in 
the making. My lecture hall 
is lively and there are busy, 
moving students all around 
me as the professor prepares 
his notes for the class. The 
projector 
luminates 
the 
wall in front of the room 
with the introductory slide 
to 
his 
PowerPoint. 
What 
seems to be the last group 
of students enter through 
the doors dispersing as they 
please. Almost all the seats 
in the lecture hall were filled 
with different people from 
different places. I may have 
been on campus for years but 
the sight of so many faces 
will always be overwhelming 
to me.
After putting away my 
phone, I began taking out my 
notebook, journal, and pens. 
There’s a growing sense of 
gratefulness within me as 
the class begins. My water 
bottle rolls to the end of my 
row while I lie my backpack 
down. It’s not within arm’s 
reach but there’s nobody who 
offers a hand. I chuckle—
there’s nobody around me 
to chuckle back. My row is 
empty. I forgot— I should’ve 
expected it if it was any 
other day. I wonder, what’s 
so wrong with me? To not be 
worthy enough for a single 
person in this school to 
willfully want to sit next to 
me. I sigh, and as expected, 
a couple of my fellow white 
classmates turn and look 

In the last several years — 
for a multitude of different 
reasons — many prestigious 
education 
institutions 
and 
organizations 
have 
made 
diversity 
a 
higher 
priority 
on their to-do list. This isn’t 
something these institutions 
should receive too much praise 
for, considering their role in 
the lack of diversity in the 
first place. However, the effort 
is 
still 
respectable. 
These 
universities — which have 
historically been a medium 
of separation between white 
people and people of color — 
are now trying to reverse that 
reputation and the societal 
inequities that have resulted 
from it. It almost gives the 
impression that a new era of 
equality is amongst us.
Though 
the 
future 
for 
the treatment of racial and 
ethnic minorities in higher 
education 
seems 
bright, 
elements of the past still rear 
their heads. There have been 
times in which I have walked 
into environments that were 
relatively diverse, yet I still 
saw the same segregation that 
I was told disintegrated with 
the Civil Rights Movement. 
I have been in spaces that 
have claimed to value the 
experiences 
of 
different 
types of people and have still 
encountered people who were 
not willing to consider ideas 
that strayed from their own 
accepted 
narrative. 
Even 
in classes that spend time 

focusing on aspects of the Black 
experience, my perspective as 
a Black woman has still been 
devalued by people who have 
never walked a day in my skin. 
Me being able to walk through 
the door did not guarantee my 
ability to get through to the 
people sitting on the other side 
of them.
This is where the problem 
lies. 
We’ve 
always 
seen 
diversity in terms of numbers 
— specifically, the percentage 
of each racial group in the 
student 
body. 
What 
we’ve 
failed to realize though, is that 
numbers say nothing about 
the experience. One can be 
in a place that is diverse and 
still not receives the benefits 
of being around people with 
different 
backgrounds 
and 
perspectives. This is, quite 
frankly, why diversity will 
never be enough. Another key 
process must be incorporated 
— integration. 
Integration is more than 
just allowing people of color to 
occupy white spaces. It is also 
inviting our cultures and our 
opinions to have a seat at the 
table. Integration is a mixture 
— of what you know and what 
you don’t. It is supposed to 
combine — or integrate — what 
people who look like you have 
to offer, as well as the offerings 
of everyone else who doesn’t. 
Having a healthy ratio of every 
race and ethnicity doesn’t cut 
it.
So 
far, 
in 
this 
current 
progression 
towards 
equal 
access, we’ve turned equality 
into a numbers game. But 
sometimes, that game tends to 
play us.

I spend a lot of time on campus 
wishing that I was anywhere else. 
Too much of this time ends up being 
spent on Instagram, where the world 
on my feed looks pinker, cutesier, 
and dreamier than how most people 
would see it. Instead of being an 
attempt to distort the truth about my 
life for likes, my Instagram feed has 
become a creative outlet for my own 
form of queer worldmaking.
Social media is an artificial view 
of reality, in which individuals post 
only the best of themselves (save for 

the less than flattering and nudes 
on “finstas” that I might show you 
later, if we get that close). Instagram 
is especially centered around sheer 
aesthetic value. Many of its users, 
including yeah, myself, care a great 
deal about their online appearances. 
When I initially began cultivating 
a “theme” for my Instagram feed, 
I sought to pink-wash Michigan 
via an obviously saturated, highly 
edited haze of filters. While it 
brought me slight satisfaction to see 
the collection of pictures that I had 
assembled together, I quickly grew 
bored of both the artificiality and 
superficiality involved within my 
process of picking my posts.

Last year, the singular 
Asian movie in the U.S. 
was Crazy Rich Asians, a 
fact agreed upon by public 
consensus. 
This 
year, 
the choice hasn’t been so 
easy. Always Be My Maybe 
(starring Ali Wong and 
Randall Park) made waves 
in 
the 
Asian 
American 
community as one of the 
first American rom-coms 
to star Asians. Bold and 
with 
appearances 
from 
familiar faces like Keanu 
Reeves, it’s an obvious 
frontrunner. But the film 
that I feel best represents 
my 
Asian 
American 
experience is The Farewell. 
A small film with a budget 
of only $3 million, it may 
not look like much, but it 
has real feeling and soul.
Directed 
by 
Chinese 
director Lulu Wang, The 
Farewell is a sobering story 
about how a grandmother’s 
terminal diagnosis leads 
the entire family to visit 
her from abroad and, out 
of love, hide the terrible 
truth. 
Perhaps 
what 
makes the premise and the 
ensuing drama so magnetic 
is the unpretentious reality 
infused it is infused with. 
The Farewell takes place 

mostly in the industrial 
city of Changchun, China. 
Like many places in China, 
in Changchun, you’ll want 
to boil your water before 
drinking it – something 
we’re reminded of as soon 
as the family arrives at the 
hotel. The hotel rooms are 
decorated 
in 
something 
not 
quite 
as 
cold 
and 
impersonal as an American 
hotel, but there’s still a 
faded grandeur. All told, we 
arrive at an unmistakably 
Chinese setting, with most 
of the movie’s dialogue 
being in Mandarin (with 
English subtitles for a non-
native speaking audience).
And yet we view all of 
this through a distinctly 
Chinese 
American 
perspective. 
Billi, 
the 
granddaughter 
and 
protagonist 
(played 
by 
Awkwafina), occasionally 
fumbles 
with 
her 
Mandarin in a way that I 
can relate to. Like Billi, 
I can scrape by in light 
conversation, but anything 
deeper than that can pose 
some 
major 
translation 
issues. More than simply 
the language barrier, the 
cultural barrier is one that 
proves challenging. When 
her family decides to not 
tell the grandmother about 
her diagnosis, Billi feels 

like the family’s deceit is 
inherently wrong and that 
it won’t bring about true 
closure. However, her more 
Chinese parents and uncle 
and aunt make it clear that 
not saying anything is a 
blessing: the grandmother 
will be able to live out her 
final days peacefully, not 
fearing death.
The 
differences 
and 
similarities 
between 
Chinese 
and 
Chinese 
Americans 
are 
at 
the 
heart of the movie. The 
Farewell 
demonstrates 
how Chinese Americans 
dance that line between 
Chinese 
and 
American, 
landing them in a no-man’s 
land. Moreover, the movie 
answers the hard question 
of which to choose: You 
can 
choose 
both, 
and 
though it can sometimes be 
alienating, being American 
and being Chinese aren’t 
incompatible 
with 
each 
other.
By talking about death, 
The Farewell succeeds in 
being a celebration of life. 
Its authentic presentation 
of the lives of average Asian 
Americans makes it shine 
brightly as one of the best 
Asian American movies of 
2019 and perhaps, as one of 
the best movies in 2019 in 
general.

The Farewell

at me from top to bottom. 
They’re 
disgusted, 
who 
allowed me to exhale in 
such a manor.
You’re staring… I see the 
side-eye, and the scared 
glances but they bounce 
off me. My rebuttal glares, 
they pierce you however, in 
an instant you look away in 
disbelief. How dare I have 
done the same thing. Keep 

turning if you must, if your 
angst continues, then you’ll 
only notice my attempts to 
look as repulsed as you do.
A diverse school and one 
with tens of thousands of 
students, yet again, I feel 
so alone. Every day. Every 
class. Every bus ride. The 
only progress being made is 
in the velocity I can make 
them shy away from me. 

Finally, mentioning it to my 
brothers, I realize I’m far 
from alone in the abyss of 
solitude. I won’t change the 
way I dress, how I talk, how 
I walk, we don’t care about 
fitting an imposed mold. 
Our brown skin has been 
shunned on what seems to 
be a consensus and we’ve 
unknowingly 
been 
alone 
— together, this whole time.

U.S. health care — without a care for the environment
C

limate 
change 
is 
a 
chronic disease. Thanks 
to our lifestyle habits, 
Earth has developed the airways 
of a smoker, tumors of trash 
and bodies of water poisoned 
by pollution. It’s no secret that 
our current treatment of the 
Earth is killing the planet and 
inadvertently killing ourselves. 
As our campus saw last Friday 
during 
the 
Global 
Climate 
Strike, the youth of today, are 
not ignorant of this fact nor 
willing to tolerate it any longer. 
The question still remains as 
to whether this spark of action 
can be fanned into a flaming 
movement. If the climate strike 
movement is in need of tinder to 
fuel its next initiative, then U.S. 
hospitals should be the next 
place it fans the flames. 
As is the case for many 
industries, health care has an 
insatiable appetite for fossil fuel 
energy, which inevitably leads 
to greenhouse gas emissions. 
Greenhouse gases are silent and 
stealthy killers. One American 
Journal of Public Health article 
found 
that 
such 
emissions 
“will negatively affect public 
health because of an increased 
prevalence of extreme weather, 
flooding, vector-borne disease 
… and malnutrition.” While the 
deadly effect of greenhouse gas 
emissions is nothing new, the 
fact that the U.S. health care 
system is one of the world’s 
largest contributors of lethal 
greenhouse gases is an irony 
that has been largely ignored 
by most hospitals. Investigators 
projected 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
“associated 
with 
health care in the United States 
would cause 123,000 to 381,000 
disability-adjusted 
life-years 
in 
future 
health 
damages.” 
Ironically, the hospitals that 
are entrusted with keeping 
American communities healthy 
are a major contributor to one 
of humanity’s greatest threats. 
In the words of a Popular 
Science article, one 2013 study 
found that between generating 
energy, using medical supplies 
and pharmaceuticals “the U.S. 
healthcare system is responsible 
for around 10 percent of the 
total emissions in the United 
States.” If all U.S. health care 
facilities in the United States 
were a country on their own, 

that country would be the 
seventh-largest 
contributor 
to carbon dioxide emissions 
in the world, according to a 
HealthLeads Article.
Unfortunately, 
the 
irony 
of the U.S. health care does 
not end with pollution. U.S 
hospitals play a significant role 
in growing America’s cancerous 
piles of landfill trash. The 
Healthcare Plastics Recycling 
Council found that American 
health care centers “generate 
approximately 14,000 tons of 
waste per day and that up to 25 
percent of that waste is plastic 
packaging and products.”
A collaborative report by 
the Center of International 
Environmental 
Law 
found 
that the breakdown of plastics 
in 
landfills 
or 
through 
incineration can lead to the 
release of microplastics that 
end up in the food we eat or the 
air we breathe. Pollutants such 
as phthalates and BPA can be 
reabsorbed by surrounding soil 
and water supplies. 
In 
response 
to 
these 
environmental atrocities, some 
would argue the U.S. health 
care system should invest in 
alternative energy sources like 
solar power or wind turbines. 
However, suggesting such a fix 
is ignorant of hospitals’ limited 
budgets and does nothing to 
reduce plastic landfill waste. 
Others 
are 
confident 
that 
incinerating 
medical 
waste 
to 
power 
hospitals 
is 
the 
answer. However, incineration 
is 
a 
double-edged 
sword. 
Incineration 
may 
reduce 
the 
volume 
of 
waste, 
but 
according to the same Center 
of International Environmental 
Law report, the toxic chemicals 
released from incineration are 
just as problematic to our health 
as the plastic left in landfills. 
Instead, the solution lies 
in rethinking plastic medical 
supplies. I envision altering 
plastic medical supplies, one 
of the most common forms of 
medical waste that ends up in 
landfills, to be plant or biomass-
based. Researchers at Michigan 
State University have already 
found success in this venture, 
according to Michigan Radio. 
While 
plant-based 
medical 
plastics is not a novel idea, I 
propose this innovation could 

go a step further by tailoring 
these plant-based plastics to be 
converted into energy without 
the need for incineration. 
Anaerobic digestion is the 
process 
by 
which 
energy 
is 
generated 
through 
the 
breakdown 
of 
plant-based 
material under intense heat 
by bacteria. With the help of 
this 
technology, 
municipal 
plastic waste from health care 
could power hospitals without 
releasing greenhouse gasses. 
Overnight, 
plastic 
medical 
waste could transform from 
being cancerous to cured. 
Not only does climate change 
demand we rethink medical 
supplies, it also demands we 
rethink health care recycling. 
By 
no 
means 
should 
the 
responsibility 
of 
reducing 
health care’s environmental 
impact fall only on hospitals. 
As future patients or health 
care 
professionals, 
we 
are 
also responsible. Therefore, 
health care recycling should 
be a grassroots movement. 
Imagine if even a fraction of 
the 3,500 tons of plastic that 
U.S. health care facilities send 
daily to landfills were properly 
sanitized 
and 
recycled 
to 
make new medical supplies. 
The same plastic waste that 
could have ended up in a 
landfill poisoning America’s 
heartland could instead be 
promoting heart health as a 
new stethoscope.
Environmental 
health 
is 
personal health. Unfortunately, 
U.S. health care has yet to 
recognize this truth. We simply 
do not have time to wait for 
health care leaders to realize 
this. Every day, the chronic 
disease 
of 
climate 
change 
only grows worse. While I 
do not want to diminish the 
importance of taking steps as 
individuals to reduce, reuse 
and recycle, I stand with the 
Climate 
Strike 
and 
know 
demands for individual efforts 
are not enough. There is no 
neutral territory when you are 
combating a chronic pandemic. 
Either you are combating the 
disease, or you are the disease. 
It is time to diagnose which side 
you are on.

The vices and virtues of the Electoral College
P

ost-2016 election, discord 
regarding the relevance 
of the Electoral College 
has become as audible as ever. 
Politicians 
and 
constituents 
alike 
have 
called 
for 
its 
abolition, condemning it as 
an 
archaic 
tradition 
long 
past its expiration date. As 
a result, many have been 
quick to propose a seemingly 
more sensible popular vote. 
Instilling 
just 
a 
popular 
vote, however, gives rise to a 
multitude of new problems. 
After 
careful 
thought, 
it 
becomes evident that replacing 
the Electoral College with a 
direct popular vote would not 
suffice. We should instead 
seek other means of reform. 
To 
understand 
why 
implementing a popular vote 
would be problematic, it is 
imperative to look back on 
our nation’s founding. Our 
country’s 
forefathers 
were 
particularly wary of direct 
democracy, despite its enticing 
simplicity. 
The 
original 
architects of the American 
republic sought to forestall the 
potential dangers it presented. 
One potential danger was the 
“tyranny of the majority” – 
the concept that, in a pure 
democracy, a majority can 
overrule a minority in all 
instances with no balance 
of powers. A popular vote 
was never considered in our 
nation, as we were founded 
with the intent of being a 
representative republic, not a 
direct democracy. 
But before delving into the 
problems 
associated 
with 
abolishing 
the 
Electoral 
College, 
it 
is 
important 
to mention that the cause 
for 
concern 
is 
far 
from 
unsubstantiated — the current 
system has proven itself to be 
far from perfect. Disapproval 
of the Electoral College often 
stems 
from 
its 
favoritism 
toward 
battleground 
swing 
states, 
with 
one 
reporter 
even naming it a national 
gerrymander: “Had two state 
borders been drawn just a 
little bit differently, shifting 
a total of four counties from 
one state to another, Hillary 
Clinton would have won the 
election.”
Additionally, 
others 
find 

issue with the fact that there 
have been five occurrences 
in U.S. history in which the 
winner of the presidential 
election and the winner of 
the 
popular 
vote 
differed. 
This 
inconsistency 
causes 
worry that the desires of the 
people are being tainted by the 
flaws of our current electoral 
process. 
Yet possibly the biggest 
concern 
people 
have 
with 
the Electoral College is its 
distortion of the one-person, 
one-vote democratic principle. 
With 
our 
current 
system, 
a grand majority of states 
are largely neglected during 
campaign season. The few 
battleground states in which 
neither the Republican nor 
Democratic parties maintain 
a 
stronghold 
often 
garner 
more 
campaign 
attention 
than the rest of the nation 
combined. In fact, two-thirds 

of campaign events during the 
2016 presidential election only 
took place in six states. To 
the ill-informed citizen, this 
statistic may be staggering and 
legitimate enough to support 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
popular vote. However, things 
aren’t quite this simple. 
Our Constitution endows 
the right to elect a president 
to states through electors, 
not individual citizens. This 
practice is fundamental to 
some of the main tenets our 
nation 
was 
founded 
upon: 
checks and balances. Divisions 
of 
power 
are 
common 
throughout our governmental 
framework, and the existence 
of the Electoral College only 
further drives in this concept. 
Meanwhile, a direct popular 
vote itself is riddled with flaws, 
despite its appearance as the 
perfect 
solution. 
Minority 

interests may be completely 
disregarded in rural areas, 
and the chance of a regionally-
popular 
candidate 
winning 
the election would certainly 
be possible. Additionally, any 
close election with suspicion 
of a miscount would prompt a 
recount, a national nightmare. 
Along with administrative 
challenges, the chances of 
realistically 
transitioning 
to a direct popular vote are 
close to none. Supreme Court 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg 
said herself that, though she 
would 
support 
eliminating 
the 
Electoral 
College, 
the 
process 
of 
amending 
the 
Constitution 
is 
notoriously 
difficult. 
Furthermore, 
convincing representatives of 
less populous states to support 
an 
amendment 
effectively 
lessening their impact would 
be especially challenging. As 
a result, any discussion for a 
popular vote appears moot.
Rather 
than 
scrap 
the 
Electoral College in pursuit 
of a popular vote, we should 
seek other ways to reform 
it. Currently, 48 states and 
Washington 
D.C. 
have 
a 
winner-takes-all process of 
allocating electors. Nebraska 
and 
Maine, 
however, 
use 
a 
congressional 
district 
method, which can allow for 
a split electoral vote. If more 
state 
legislatures 
reformed 
their 
allocation 
methods, 
mismatches 
between 
the 
results of the electoral and 
popular vote would be less 
drastic. 
Mob 
rule 
has 
revealed 
itself catastrophic throughout 
history, 
and 
the 
Electoral 
College was wisely created to 
combat any destruction a fickle 
crowd might bring. Though the 
Electoral College is imperfect, 
the proposition to implement 
a popular vote is just as 
problematic. 
Rather 
than 
continue to cry for an abolition 
rendered nearly impossible by 
our Constitution, we should 
seek meaningful reform to 
our current methodology. If 
achieved, our republic can 
make a substantial step toward 
a truer democracy.

Oil moguls shouldn’t get off scot-free
B

efore I begin this piece, 
let me just say: Climate 
change is real and it is 
caused by humans. I’m not here 
to convince you otherwise if 
you’re in denial. All I have to 
say is that you’re better off 
not defending people who are 
complicit with your drowning 
in 20 years. Oil CEOs need 
to be held accountable for 
the 
damage 
they’ve 
done 
to the environment. Time 
and time again, we see the 
responsibility 
of 
climate 
change and the destruction of 
the environment placed on the 
individual, which is incredibly 
disingenuous 
considering 
the statistics of the matter. 
The Carbon Majors Report 
compiled 
by 
the 
Climate 
Accountability 
Institute, 
a 
non-profit organization that 
monitors 
climate 
change 
and the impact humans have 
on the environment, states 
that just 100 companies are 
responsible 
for 
almost 
71 
percent of carbon emissions. 
Just 100 companies. China 
can also take the blame for the 
abhorrent amounts of carbon 
dioxide produced per year, 
with Shenhua Group being 
the top producer. But when 
considering carbon emissions 
per capita, the U.S. is still 
the leader by a large margin. 
Banning plastic straws in a 
single city may help waste 
for that region, but carbon 
emissions are global. 
Now, I’m not saying that 
reducing your plastic waste 
isn’t a noble goal. Please 
continue to monitor your 
own 
contributions 
to 
the 
global carbon footprint. What 
I am saying, however, is that 
it mostly isn’t your fault. The 
blame should fall on people 
like oil executive Bob Dudley, 
who oversaw BP’s disaster 
in the Gulf Coast in 2008. 
It should fall upon people 
like 
oil-executiver-turned-

diplomat Rex Tillerson, who 
gave millions of dollars to bad 
faith actors in favor of climate 
deregulation. It should be 
put upon the moguls who 
hold billions upon billions 
of dollars milked from the 
substances that are fueling the 
most destructive phenomenon 
in our planet’s history since 
the Fifth Extinction.
On the topic of oil moguls, 
the late David Koch can be a 
good example of what these 
people are usually up to. 
Institutions 
like 
the 
Cato 
Institute, the Institute for 
Energy 
Research 
and 
the 
Heritage 
Foundation 
have 
all been funded by Koch and 
his 
affiliated 
businesses. 
The Cato Institute has been 
noted 
to 
oppose 
climate 
change reform, with their 
main page on the topic stating 
that “there is ample time to 
develop such technologies,” 
to which I respond: There 
is not ample time. I’m sure 
you’ve heard the ultimatum 
from 
the 
United 
Nations 
that we only have 12 years 
to act. But it’s only in these 
companies’ 
best 
interests 
to 
spread 
misinformation. 
Companies like Exxon Mobil 
also participate in donating 
to bad faith actors, no doubt, 
whether they be institutes or 
political candidates.
The ultra-rich may claim 
innocence 
or 
ignorance, 
stating “it’s just business” to 
keep the blood off their hands, 
but just like it was for Pontius 
Pilate, the evil deeds are their 
responsibility. They’re having 
planet Earth executed, and 
washing its blood over the 
masses that don’t have the 
funds to ship themselves to 
Mars. They knew for years 
that 
climate 
change 
was 
happening, revealed in 330 
pages 
of 
internal 
memos 
from companies like Exxon 
Mobil and Koch Industries. 

In 1968, a document given 
by 
the 
Stanford 
Research 
Institute to the American 
Petroleum Institute, a trade 
organization which included 
and 
still 
includes 
Exxon 
Mobil and Chevron, states 
that, though they were unsure 
of 
the 
true 
ramifications, 
“there seems to be no doubt 
that the potential damage 
could be severe,’’ referring to 
the release of carbon dioxide 
and other pollutants. I find 
it completely ridiculous that 
there is a deliberate avoidance 
of responsibility and foresight 
by policy makers. If it were 
me personally, I would throw 
them in prison and forcibly 
seize 
all 
of 
their 
wealth 
and put it into research and 
development of clean energy. 
But that’s a little too radical, 
so let’s just stick with heavier 
taxes.
Climate change has been 
a focal point in the 2020 
election, 
with 
multiple 
candidates pontificating on 
their own approach to solving 
the 
crisis. 
We’ve 
recently 
had a global climate strike. 
Awareness is increasing. You 
may be asking yourself why 
it would matter that these 
individuals walk free, saying 
things like, “Who cares?” and, 
“We should be focusing on 
the actual issue.” But without 
accountability 
for 
actions, 
these same kinds of industries 
will get away with exploiting 
the planet for profit and make 
our efforts to solve climate 
change futile. The mere fact 
that these corporations would 
have consequences for their 
actions would send a message 
to those who threaten the 
environment. We care about 
our planet, and those who 
irrevocably send it to its death 
will not be tolerated.

Though most of us would have to agree 
that every quality game day ends in food, 
I’m not sure most of us recognize that some 
of the most important culinary triumphs of 
the day lie in the most unassuming of places: 
the stadium. Perhaps because making it to 
the game is such a feat among students who 
prefer the tailgate to the the actual kick-
off, we don’t often realize that by making 
it into the stadium not only are we there to 
watch football, we’re also there to feast. 
The stadium’s culinary facilities are run by 
Sodexo, a food service business that manages 
University athletics, and they are completely 
rebranding what it means to order any kind of 
food at a sporting event.
Growing up, I remember being taken to 
Metlife Stadium in New Jersey, enticed by 
the idea of a hot dog slathered in mustard and 
salty french fries. Beer scented concrete and 
sticky aluminum countertops were the staples 
of the stadiums of my childhood nightmares. 
If I was lucky and behaved (instead of 
complaining about my distaste for sports) my 
mom would let me have a Carvel ice cream 
cone. Other than that, the food options were 
fairly limited. Being diagnosed with Celiac 
disease when I was 17 basically rid me of the 
ability to eat in sporting stadiums around the 
country.
Sodexo, on the other hand, is changing 
the Big House’s culinary game completely. 
Sodexo’s job through the University is to 
coordinate both non-profit, local eateries to 
set up shop on Ann Arbor autumn Saturday’s 
around the circumference of the Big House 
and additionally to run the Big House’s 
private concessions as well. Last year alone, 
as a collective the stadium made around 
$245,000 in profit on food. This year, they 
have their sights set higher. 
On my culinary food tour around the 
stadium, I started at the Greek Eats stand. 
With options like chicken shawarma and 
loaded gyros, this stand alone revamps drunk 
munchies entirely. The chicken shawarma I 
tasted was loaded with thick garlic sauce that 
complimented the chicken well. Next to the 
Greek Eats stand you can find Ann Arbor’s 
own Bearclaw Coffee — a coffee cart stocked 
with a menu of seasonal lattes and homemade 
pastries. Just down from there the “Street 
Eats” stand specializes in a variety of tacos. 
Most popular on the menu is the “walking 
taco,” a taco bowl with layers of salty fritos 
topped with beans, cheese, salsa and beef. 
This dish is best accompanied by a fork and 
an Oberon to wash it all down. The variety 
of choices does not end there. Between each 
and every local stand are concession booths 
which now sell Impossible Burgers and have 
gluten free and vegan offerings as well. Ray’s 

Red Hots also makes an appearance on the 
perimeter of the stadium, providing your 
favorite East University bites during halftime 
or in between quarters. 
But my favorite stand has to be the “Tot 
Spot,” a concession booth that specializes 
in loaded tater tots. I would recommend the 
“Tot-chos” or the “Classic Tots,” though 
all 
the 
possible 
topping 
combinations 
compliment the golden brown, crispy tater 
tots perfectly. Other standouts include the 
minority female run “Detroit Dough” edible 
cookie dough carts that line the stadium. 
Co-founder and CEO Autumn Kyles is a 
University alum who proudly serves their 
edible cookie dough to fans every game day. 
For other sweet tooth options, RJ’s is a loaded 
milkshake stand and a family-run business. 
The matriarch of the family, Yvette Wilkie, 
started making desserts after her son passed 
away to help combat her depression, and 
now you can find their ice cream sandwich 
and donut embellished cookies & cream 
milkshakes at every game day. 
The efforts by Sodexo to make the Michigan 
football experience more than a game should 
not go unnoticed. Football is a story. You 
have your protagonists and antagonists, your 
climax and your narrative line — and you 
never know if the ending is going to be happy 
or sad. Both good games and bad games, home 
team and away team, everyone attending the 
Big House has one thing in common: We’re all 
hungry. The eats at the Big House can make 
any game, regardless of the score, a good one.

football, but also the food

FILM REVIEW

Stories about serial killers tend to involve 
obsession, not only in their examination of 
startlingly meticulous murderers, but of the people 
who investigate their crimes. One needs to look no 
further than the films “Zodiac,” “Se7en” and even 
the Netflix show “Mindhunter,” to experience the 
gradual psychological erosion that comes from 
obsession with the macabre. Of course, all three 
of these are products of David Fincher, who is 
arguably the master of this archetype. He makes 
his characters and his viewers wonder why they 
are so drawn into the grisliest human behavior 
and, in doing so, paints this obsession as a dark and 
poisonous curiosity. 
A movie that misunderstands the trope of 
the in-too-deep murder investigator is “In the 
Shadow of the Moon,” directed by Jim Mickle 
(“Cold in July”). When Philadelphia policeman 
Thomas “Locke” Lockhart (Boyd Holbrook, who 
coincidentally played an investigator in Fincher’s 
“Gone Girl,”) notices a temporal pattern of unsolved 
murders, his obsession wears away at his own 
mental stability and the relationships around him. 
“Moon” struggles to establish enough sympathy 
between the audience and Locke. An important 
aspect of understanding an investigator’s descent 
into darkness is eagerly following along with them. 
Instead of a continuous timeline, the film stitches 

together moments from every nine years of his life 
to depict the various stages of his investigation. As 
a result, the transition is blunt and dry, replacing 
character nuance with increasingly mangier facial 
hair and crazier theories.
A reason that Locke doesn’t connect with the 
audience is that the film makes foolhardy, tactless 
dives into political commentary. Locke’s work 
central to this misstep — early in the film, he marks 
himself as part of a corrupt police system, one that 
operates on racial profiling and a general dismissal 
of due process. As an audience, grappling with 
Locke’s morality for the rest of the film is certainly 
tough, and when the film coerces us to root for him 
by placing tragedy after tragedy along his journey, 
it’s hard not to be incensed at the writing.
The 
movie’s 
admission 
of, 
and 
eventual 
complicity with, the systematic violence of police 
isn’t its only serious misstep. In future vignettes, 
it perplexingly criticizes protests against that 
violence. “Why are they so angry?” Locke’s 
daughter asks him as she gazes out a window at a 
march outside. “Some people aren’t happy unless 
they’re mad. You’ll see what I mean when you 
get older,” he replies smugly. One might think 
that Locke is a villain to the story’s anxieties, 
but “Moon” is simply not that aware. It aches to 
humanize him without understanding the costs of 
doing so. 
“Moon” is truly infuriating because Mickle 
incorporates eye-catching cinematography and 
meaningful camerawork into a story that never 
deserves it. For all its visual flair, the movie is a 
sour pill to swallow. The performances are also 
lacking, making me wonder if a halfway decent cast 
could have at least made the journey worthwhile. 
Perhaps the more fascinating story of obsession 
in “Moon” is that of the filmmakers and their 
curmudgeonly desperation to say something, 
anything about current politics. This trap is one 
that many films of the last few years have fallen 
into, some notably more successful than others. 
These distractions took away from a legitimately 
interesting science fiction subplot that gave the 
story a twist that most detective stories don’t have. 
In many ways, “Moon” is just another Netflix 
movie — a compelling idea executed poorly, and a 
story that can surely be avoided.

The opening track of The Highwomen’s self-
titled debut album proclaims that they’ll “be back 
again and again and again and again and again.” 
This hook, like much of the song’s instrumentation 
and storytelling, mirrors The Highwaymen’s 
1985 theme song “Highwayman.” But in 2019, 
sung by women, these lyrics sound different. 
Simultaneously a rally cry for women in country 
music and a warning to the male-dominated 
industry, Maren Morris, Brandi Carlile, Natalie 
Hemby and Amanda Shires’s insistence that they 
aren’t going anywhere, and have been important 
all along, is refreshing. 
The Highwomen’s roster doesn’t quite read 
like the country-music-Mount Rushmore that is 
The Highwaymen, and that’s the problem. Any 
four female artists popular in country music 
today have never been given the opportunity to 
reach their stature. By staking their own claim to 
greatness, and delivering an album to back it up, 
The Highwomen pave the way for more visibility, 

more inclusion, and more women-focused themes 
in the genre, something the “bro-country” era of 
the 2010s was overshadowing.
Answering how Morris’s country pop would 
mesh with Carlile’s Americana, the group’s 
first single, “Redesigning Women,” settles The 
Highwomen into a traditional-leaning, acoustic 
country sound that persists throughout the 
album. As all four members sing in unison about 
being women who do it all: “Making bank, shaking 
hands, driving 80 / Tryna get home just to feed the 
baby,” this track is the album’s heartbeat, giving 
life to the more specific tales of empowerment 
that follow. 
“Loose Change” is one of those songs. Simple 
but catchy, Morris sings about knowing her worth. 
“Love is not supposed to be played like Monopoly” 
she cautions. The song plays with the extremes of 
a penny’s (and a person’s) value in another’s eyes, 
from being worthless when it’s “loose change” to 
being priceless when it’s “lucky.” And just like a 
penny, Morris suggests that a woman should “roll 
away” when she isn’t being treated nicely.
“If She Ever Leaves Me” finds Carlile in a bar, 
staring down a cowboy who’s been keeping an eye 
on her wife, and letting him know that even if 
they weren’t together anymore, her wife would 
never be with him. Queer country songs are 
possible, everyone! Carlile sounds as gorgeous 
as always, and it’s exciting to think that in 
a stereotypically homophobic genre, more 
explicitly LGBTQ-friendly songs are coming to 
light.
If you’re still pissed with someone you’ve 
given a few too many chances to (and also 
want to feel like you’re in an old Western film) 
“Don’t Call Me” will take you there. This song 
is the kind of funny you find pacing back and 
forth with your fists clenched. The verses and 
outro string together suggestions for how the 
person who said they “outgrew” Carlile and 
Shires should fix their mess without them. 
“Call your doctor … your lawyer … if you can 
afford one” Shires smirks. “Call your spiritual 
guide or mood enlightener, your tattoo artist.” 
She could go on.
But the absolute stand out of the album 
is “Cocktail and a Song.” Written and sung 
by Shires alone, she captures a conversation 
with her dad about his impending passing. 

It’s heartbreaking. “Don’t you let me see you cry, 
don’t you go grieving / Not before I’m gone” he 
tells her. But it’s also light-hearted. When Shires 
requests his “silver belt buckle and maybe (his) 
black Stetson hat” they both laugh, which makes 
the song sting even more.
Women of any country music era aren’t “around 
and around and around and around and around” 
like Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash are today, 
but The Highwomen demonstrate why they 

should be. It’s a shame that four individually strong 
artists had to come together to bring attention to 
women’s contributions to country music, because 
the excellence this supergroup demonstrates is 
nothing new. Still, one can’t help but feel lucky 
that they did decide to take a stand and release 
an album that stands up to their namesake. Now 
all we can do is look forward to when they “come 
back again” and keep rooting for them — and other 
women — in the meantime.

The School of Music, Theatre & Dance presented the String Showcase 
at Stamps Auditorium this Wednesday evening. Students were chosen 
by their faculty to perform in the String Showcase; the performers 
ranged from first year undergraduate music students to graduate 
students to musicians who have already received their doctorates. That 
said, I could not tell any difference in talent levels — I was pleasantly 
surprised by how exceptional the entire show was. The performance 
showcased a wide range of music. They chose a satisfying balance of 
classical and contemporary compositions.
Although the music was seemingly flawless, the performers struggled 
to maintain their emotional connection to the music. Sometimes, 
especially during the first piece, performers would comment on 
their work with their facial expressions, either smirking or stealing 
suspicious glances at their fellow performers. It was disappointing to 
see that their spirit was not fully committed to the music. 
Exceptions to this critique include the Anthony Green piece and 
Julius Conus’s Violin Concerto, as both of those pieces contained 
passion that was missing in the others. In the Julius Conus piece, 
the intensity given so generously by the violinist Kevin Sung was 
refreshing. The Anthony Green piece performed by Jonah Lyon and 
May Tang on violin, Maxwell Moore on viola and Gabrielle Hooper 
on cello was reminiscent of a classic horror film score, except far more 
dynamic and exciting. I most enjoyed the percussive and grounded 
nature of the piece. 
The finale performed by violist Stuart Carlson and pianist Mi-Eun 
Kim was especially rewarding because it was to the tune of “Smile” by 
Charlie Chaplin. The audience hummed along and chuckled to the tune. 
Ending the show with “Smile” after experiencing all the complexity 
of the pieces before seemed like a reward for attending. This is not 
to say that Carlson’s or Kim’s performance was any less nuanced or 

exceptional as the others. The performance of this song was just so 
inspiring that my inner ballerina wanted to jump up on the stage and 
dance.
The impulse to twitch along to the music happened a couple other 
times during the show when the musicians were especially committed. 
The audience couldn’t help but to be affected physically when the music 
was especially compelling. Those were my favorite moments.
The String Showcase happens monthly, so if you missed this one, 
there will be another next month. Plus, the event is free. It’s a great way 
to support artists and learn more about the exceptional work they do 
on North Campus.

ALBUM REVIEW

The answer is no. This isn’t a porn thing. 
Granted, it could be said the good vibes and 
jam-worthy beats of The New Pornographers 
are their own hearty brand of music “porn.” The 
band’s new album, In the Morse Code of Brake 
Lights, is quirky, playful and fun. More than 
that, the album is a breath of fresh air. Here, 
The New Pornographers manage to find a way to 
revitalize old themes, injecting their songs with a 
refreshing sense of wonder and excitement. 
“You’ll Need A New Backseat Driver” opens 
the album with a song of roadtrips and journeys 
— an ode to the forgotten, scoffed-at backseat 
driver. Singing “If you’re gonna travel and never 
arrive there / You’ll need a backseat driver,” the 
backseat driver, while a nuisance, is an essential 
part of any adventure. “Falling Down The Stairs 
Of Your Smile” follows this quirky spirit, joking 
about how love is messy and unexpected — like 
falling down the stairs. “Too many soapboxes, 
not enough violins / Too many shipwrecks, not 
enough sirens,” this playful spirit extends to 
embracing the unconventional and original, 
discarding the boring to take the gamble. 
Autumn, for indie bands, is the golden season 
for heavy, introspective songs and soul-searching 
compositions. There often seems to be an implicit 
agreement that summertime is for “fun” music, 
leaving fall with all the subdued ballads and 
slow tunes. The New Pornographers retaliate 
against this norm. Whether intentional or not, 
In the Morse Code of Brake Lights holds on tightly 
to their trademark high-spirited, merry music-

making. 
Don’t 
confuse 
this 
light-heartedness 
with a lack of substance, however. The New 
Pornographers don’t sacrifice any symbolism and 
thematic interpretation in order to keep their 
light edge. “Higher Beams” in particular touches 
upon the realm of struggle: “Deep in the culture 
of fear, we all hate living here / But you know 
when you can’t afford to leave?” Commentary 
on the current social climate, perhaps, where 
16-year-old girls must scold a disunited congress 
and a modern day “Red Scare” in the chilling 
form of anti-immigration sentiment became the 
monsters under the bed. 
“You Won’t Need Those Where You’re Going” 
is the most notable exception — but not the rule 
— of the album. Singing with a touch of somber 
lament, “We’re raw footage, still unedited / It’s 
awkward, rough and repetitive / But it could win 
awards when and if it’s shown,” love is messy, and 
difficult, and painful. In this brief, two-minute 
interlude, The New Pornographers embrace loss, 
honest and open in their performance and writing 
— but rather than bringing the mood of the album 
down, the track makes the rest of the album’s 
boisterous spirit more tangible in comparison.
But music doesn’t have to be sad to be serious. 
Then again, it might be even more amusing if The 
New Pornographers were a mopey ballad type 
of band — their name alone would reach a new 
level of irony. In the Morse Code of Brake Lights 
is perfect to combat oncoming winter blues 
— they bring the sunshine to fall’s crisp, cool 
weather. For those who like Scandinavian pop 
and indie bands, like Of Monsters and Men, and 
off-beat indie bands, like Passion Pit, The New 
Pornographers are a good addition to any fall 
playlist.

At times, it can feel as though there are as 
many courtroom dramas as there are courts. 
Each series goes to trial, making its case for what 
sets it apart from the hundreds of other legal 
dramas. “All Rise,” CBS’s newest effort, attempts 
to establish itself amongst the likes of shows 
from Shonda Rhimes or Aaron Sorkin. However, 
its endeavor in imitation misses Rhimes’ knack 
for storytelling and Sorkin’s wit and character.
“All Rise” follows new judge Lola Carmichael 
(Simone Missick, “Luke Cage”), and the various 
prosecutors, 
public 
defenders 
and 
court 
employees that surround her as their lives weave 
in and out of the injustices of a Los Angeles 
courthouse. Much of the episode follows the case 
of public defender Emily Lopez (Jessica Camacho, 
“The Flash”), which involves a young woman who 
may be wrongly arrested for burglary. However, 
when she first arrives to the courtroom, she’s 
pants-less due to the incompetence of the county 
jail. After a mildly racist breakdown by a bailiff, 
who then attempts to shoot the judge, the case 
comes before Carmichael, who intends to right 
the wrongs of a fatigued justice system.
 To the show’s credit, its premise is established 
swiftly and effectively. Within the first five 
minutes, the basic themes are introduced. We 
find out that Los Angeles is riddled with crime, 
but Carmichael pities most criminals for their 
environment. There’s also the snappy, wise-
cracking prosecutor, Mark Callan (Wilson 
Bethel, “Heart of Dixie”), whom Carmichael has 
history with as a lawyer and friend. Then, within 
the course of the thirty seconds it takes to walk 
through the metal detector and to the elevator, 
Callan rapidly details all of Carmichael’s likes 
and dislikes.
 While the plot may move with equal 
parts speed and deftness, it fails to connect. 
Each character on “All Rise” is thoroughly 
conventional. We have the relaxed, wise judge, 
the quippy prosecutor, a sensitive public defender 
and even a charming bailiff trying to rise above 
his station. The show does deserve credit for its 
relatively diverse cast, attempting to accurately 
reflect Los Angeles’ colorful makeup. However, 
having a diverse cast is not a sufficient substitute 
for a lacking engaging characters.
It feels as though the show also neglects to 
actively engage its characters. For example, Luke 
(J. Alex Brinson, “Travelers”) the court officer 
shoots the insane, racist bailiff who shot at the 

judge from the above scene. This might make for 
a rich study in the toll the unfortunate aspects of 
law enforcement might have on a person. Instead, 
it’s used as a way to connect characters and move 
the plot, before being quickly forgotten. It’s as if 
the show attempts to efficiently cram plot points 
into the pilot, while the characters just become 
scenery, flatly rotating around the narrative.
While “All Rise” promises a focus on social 
justice — trying to fix the problems of an unjust 
court from within — it’s hard to say that it has 
made good on that promise. The focus of the 
pilot seemed to be the personal lives of these 
people, which so far is not very interesting. The 
moments in which justice is shown to be skewed 
are few, and they seem to be more dramatic than 
anything.
The pilot for “All Rise” is unimpressive, but 
that doesn’t mean the show is bad — at least 
not yet. There are roots here for a very smart 
and provoking show that tackles the delicate 
and frightening balance of our justice system. 
What’s more, it has the opportunity to explore 
and question the position of minorities on either 
side of the Judge’s bench. Yet, I’m scared the 
show will err too much to the side of melodrama, 
neglecting character study for an overstuffed 
plot. If “All Rise” can pull off being the show it 
seems to want to be, it’ll be amazing. But for now, 
it has a long way to go.

Michigan destroys Rutgers, Knights fire coach in aftermath

In the fourth quarter, up 38 

points, Michigan went for it on 

fourth down.

The Wolverines’ latest scoring 

drive had been courtesy of third-

string quarterback Joe Milton 

and 
fourth-string 
running 

back Hassan Haskins. Facing 

fourth-and-goal at the one-yard 

line with the game all but over, 

Michigan could’ve been forgiven 

for mailing it in and kicking the 

field goal. Instead, Milton ran a 

bootleg, scored a touchdown and 

mocked ripping open his shirt, a 

la Superman.

Last week, in a blowout loss 

to Wisconsin, the 20th-ranked 

Wolverines (3-1 overall, 1-1 Big 

Ten) seemed to lack confidence 

and, more than that, killer 

instinct. While it’s hard to prove 

much against Rutgers (1-3, 0-2), 

likely the worst team in the Big 

Ten, Saturday proved about 

as good a redemption game 

as Michigan could’ve hoped 

for. It played like a team with 

something to prove, running up 

the score in a 52-0 win. It was 

the team’s first shutout since 

2016.

“Definitely helps us a lot as a 

team get that confidence back,” 

said sophomore linebacker Cam 

McGrone. “Because last week 

was a little down but this game 

with this goose egg, it definitely 

lifted our spirits.”

The 
calls 
for 
senior 

quarterback Shea Patterson’s job 

reached a fever pitch after last 

week’s setback, but Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh kept the 

faith in his signal-caller, and a 

week after not even completing 

half 
his 
passes, 
Patterson 

completed 17-of-23 passes for 276 

yards, throwing a touchdown 

and running for three more. 

Offensive coordinator Josh 

Gattis spent the game calling 

plays on the sideline instead 

of from the box, wanting to be 

a little more hands-on. And 

though Rutgers hardly offered 

a test, the move seemed to 

help. Patterson seemed more 

comfortable in the pocket, ably 

scrambling and making plays 

with his feet. Michigan trusted 

its receivers to make plays — 

the combination of juniors Nico 

Collins, Donovan Peoples-Jones 

and Tarik Black. That trio, along 

with sophomore Ronnie Bell, 

combined for 14 catches for 

248 yards in what could be the 

beginning of a more involved 

passing game. That was evident 

from the first two drives.

In each of the past three 

games, Michigan fumbled its 

opening drive away. But this 

week, on the fifth play of the 

drive, Patterson found an open 

Nico Collins along the sideline. 

Collins then turned upfield and 

ran for a 48-yard touchdown. 

After forcing a three-and-out, 

the Wolverines got the ball 

back and — after the Scarlet 

Knights extended the drive 

with two defensive penalties — 

Patterson perfectly placed a ball 

to Peoples-Jones just short of 

the end zone. Two plays later, on 

third-and-goal, Patterson took it 

in himself on a bootleg.

“Everybody 
was 
hungry,” 

Peoples-Jones said. “Everybody 

wanted to make a play.”

And even when things didn’t 

quite go right, the Wolverines 

fought through it in a way they 

couldn’t last week. When the 

defense struggled in a late-

first quarter drive, sophomore 

defensive end Aidan Hutchinson 

hit Scarlet Knights quarterback 

Artur Sitkowski and stopped 

him short on fourth down from 

the 5-yard line. After Patterson 

threw a red-zone interception 

in the third quarter, the defense 

stopped Rutgers on fourth-and-1 

at its own 41-yard line, then the 

offense marched down the field. 

Bell fought for every extra yard 

after a catch in the third quarter 

and pushed his defenders all the 

way to the 1-yard line, setting up 

a Patterson quarterback sneak 

for Michigan’s fifth touchdown 

of the day.

“There was a lot of trust 

there,” Harbaugh said. “Players 

trusting the coaches, coaches 

trusting the players, and a lot of 

work. It was good to see it pay 

off in a victory that was much 

needed.”

After the debacle in Madison, 

it was just the kind of win the 

Wolverines needed, and even 

with all caveats attached, they 

played with the kind of spark 

that was missing the first three 

weeks. They wore the Scarlet 

Knights down to a pulp and 

maintained 
their 
intensity 

throughout.

At least for a day, all the 

questions 
surrounding 

Michigan quieted to a hush.

ASH KICKING

Brown’s 
blueprint 
comes into 
focus

In year four of Don Brown running 
Michigan’s 
defense, 
there’s 
little 
question as to what he wants his unit 
to be.
He’s going to play man-to-man. 
He’s going to blitz. He’s going to tell 
his team to swarm the ball carrier 
with abandon. They’re going to do 
all that, and dare the offense to beat 
them.
When Brown coached at UMass, 
UConn and Boston College, the 
first pages of his playbook carried a 
parable about the African plains. He’s 
relayed the story at Michigan, too. 
Every gazelle knows it must outrun 
the fastest lion or be killed. Every 
lion knows it must outrun the slowest 
gazelle or it will starve.
And then, in all caps: “WHEN THE 
SUN COMES UP, YOU BETTER BE 
RUNNING!”
All this is to say that, as words like 
“identity” have gotten thrown around 
the Michigan football team this week, 
Brown has never had any question as 
to what he wants his team to be. It’s 
just a matter of whether they can do 
it.
On Saturday, without question, 
they did.
A week after Wisconsin throttled 
them in Madison, gaining 359 yards 
on the ground in one of the most 
resounding losses of Brown’s tenure, 
his unit held Rutgers to 46 rushing 
yards, 152 total yards and zero points. 
It’s Michigan’s first shutout since 
2016. 
You’d be justified to take that with 
a grain of salt — a 52-0 win against 
Rutgers is, ultimately, a win against 
the Power Five’s perpetual bottom-
feeder. It means little in terms of 
whether the Wolverines can improve 
when they play a team like Wisconsin 
again.
But, if nothing else, it provided a 
pretty good reminder of what Brown’s 
defenses can be at their best.
“We got back to playing how we 
play,” said sophomore linebacker 
Cam McGrone. “How we played 
last season, the two games before 
Wisconsin. We just got back to who 
we were.”
McGrone is one of the bolts on 
which Michigan’s defense hinges, 
a reality that was exacerbated on 
Saturday with Josh Ross sitting due 
to injury. A four-star prospect, he sat 
and watched last year. When he got in 
during the first three games this year, 
he did little to stand out. 
Against Rutgers, he felt like he was 
in high school again, flying all over 
the field, hitting the quarterback, 
viscerally impacting the game. “If 
he keeps playing like this, he’s gonna 
be a star,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh.
For a defense that had played well 
on paper but had yet to really click, 
McGrone was one of several puzzle 
pieces that seemed to fall into place. 
A defensive line group that the 
Badgers 
manhandled 
dominated 
the line of scrimmage behind Kwity 
Paye and a healthy Mike Dwumfour. 
Michigan notched two sacks, four 
quarterback hits and six tackles for 
loss. It felt like more.
“I felt like our whole D-Line was 
playing well this week,” Paye said. 
“We really took it upon us in practice 
to really dive for the quarterback and 
make sure we do everything that we 
can (to get) back there.”
McGrone 
played 
sideline-to-
sideline and the linebackers played 
with the energy they sorely lacked 
in Madison. The secondary shut off 
whatever options Rutgers quarterback 
Artur Sitkowski had downfield and 
freshman safety Daxton Hill, a five-
star who was pegged to contribute 
immediately from the moment he 
committed, made a tangible impact.
All of this comes with the obvious 
caveat that it’s what any competent 
team should do to Rutgers. Call it 
a result of that, or call it a result of 
extra motivation stemming from last 
week. Certainly both explanations 
have 
some 
truth 
to 
them, 
and 
replicating the performance against 
Iowa next week is the first real test. 
But Michigan at least has a blueprint 
now.
“I feel like our linebackers played 
well this week,” Paye said. “I feel like 
our safeties played well and I feel like 
our D-Line played well. I feel like we 
were just hungry to just come out 
here and play. Our main objective was 
just to shut them out.”
Mission accomplished.

“

A-to-Z.”
That’s how Jim Harbaugh 
framed the Michigan football 
team’s problems last Monday. Full-
scale. Thorough.
In that context, Saturday was as 
close to a no-win 
proposition as a 
football game can 
be.
Had Michigan 
lost — or even 
played to a close 
win — we’d be 
gathered here 
to eulogize this 
football season 
and discuss the 
dying pulse of the 
program writ large. Instead, the Wol-
verines beat Rutgers, 52-0. The Scarlet 
Knights turned around and fired their 
head coach Sunday morning, casting 
their net for a savior from seemingly-
interminable irrelevance.
Which is to say: Beating the worst 
Power Five program in modern histo-
ry (using SP+ and common logic) does 
not nullify last week’s loss at Wiscon-
sin, nor is anyone pretending it does.
But that doesn’t mean Saturday’s 
game was devoid of meaning. There 
are real things worth carrying for-
ward. Here are a few.
The kids are alright
It’s not just that sophomore Cam 
McGrone and freshman Daxton Hill 
showed promise of a bright future 
Saturday, though both did. It’s that 
they’re ready to play — right now — for 
a defense that could really use talent 
of that ilk.
McGrone filled in at middle line-
backer admirably for junior Josh Ross 
as the latter sat with an injury. He 
showed signs of the promised speed 
and physicality that those who fol-
lowed his recruitment expected.
“If he keeps playing like this, he’s 
going to be a star,” Harbaugh said of 
McGrone.
Hill is one of those five-star talents 
who does things that make it plainly 
clear why he was so highly-coveted. 
Saturday, there were multiple instanc-
es in which he identified a target, beat 
his man to the spot and finished the 
tackle with authority. The tackle on 
a punt return stands out, of course, 
but so did his ability to set the edge on 

runs to the sideline. 
His performance Saturday was 
remiscent of Jabrill Peppers early in 
his career. It’s hard to say whether 
Hill, akin to Peppers, is ready to play 
starter-level snaps in big games, but 
boy does that talent make it worth 
finding out.
“(Hill is) growing as a football 
player very quickly,” Harbaugh said. 
“He’s just so fast; that speed shows 
up. It shows up when it shows up. You 
see it with Dax Hill. You see it with 
Cam McGrone. You see it with guys 
like that.”
Then the key.
“I think you can probably predict 
he’ll be getting more and more time.”
Surely, that’s music to Michigan 
fans’ ears. It’s time to throw Hill and 
McGrone into the fire and see if they 
can hang. If they can, the potential of 
this defense grows noticeably.
Gattis is growing
Put the scoreline aside for a 
moment. Notching 52 points and over 
450 yards against any semi-functional 
team is a good sign for this group, but 
that’s almost secondary to the bigger 
point.
It can be easy to forget Josh Gattis 
is no more than a month into a major 
coaching adjustment. Think about 
where you were the last time you were 
mere months into such a formative life 
transition. Everything at this juncture 
is still experimental. And so, even 
against defenses that stand no chance, 
there are realizations to be gleaned as 
Gattis and his personnel work toward 
a coherent marriage. 
Saturday, Gattis had senior quar-
terback Shea Patterson on the move 
more frequently. For the first time all 
season, he found a balance of run and 
pass, with a near even split until gar-
bage time featured largely runs.
And while body language can fre-
quently mislead, Gattis looked like 
a coach back in his element on the 
sideline, conversing with the receiver 
group during breaks, yelling at the ref-
erees, high-fiving players after scores. 
Everyone is quick to judge this 
offense, and thus far, there’s been little 
to feel good about. But Gattis talked a 
lot about trust this week. Trust with 
his players. Trust in his system. Trust 
in himself. Trust that all of this will 
work.

“All week, (Gattis) emphasized 
believing in his players, and we just 
have to believe in him,” said junior 
running back Christian Turner. “I 
think him being on the sideline just 
emphasized that even more.”
Success breeds belief. Belief breeds 
success.
Both clearly take time, and if you 
asked those around the program right 
now, they’ll say it takes adversity like 
the kind they’ve faced.
Moving to the sideline is not the 
magic elixir to ensuring that bond, nor 
is bludgeoning a lowly foe. But it’s rea-
sonable to have some patience as that 
trust — and hope — builds.
Shea Patterson is not, and has 
never been, the problem
What you thought Shea Patterson 
would be is not his fault, nor has it 
ever been. He’s not good enough to 
overcome offensive line struggles. 
He’s not good enough to work through 
schematic confusion. He, himself, 
cannot overcome the pervasive issues 
present in this offense early in the 
season.
If you thought otherwise, that’s on 
you, not him.
He’s the best quarterback on this 
roster. Saturday, he showed what 
he can do when he has time and a 
coherent flow. From his throw to 
sophomore Donovan Peoples-Jones 
on the second drive of the game to his 
three rushing touchdowns, Patterson 
showed, above all, that he remains 
capable of being a well above-average 
quarterback and doing things no other 
quarterback on this roster can. His 
lone interception came on a go-route 
to junior Nico Collins, a throw that 
required a bit more air, but was far 
from a fatal error. 
Shea Patterson is who he is — no 
more, no less. What he’s not is the root 
of any problem with this team.
Those “A-to-Z” problems did not 
suddenly vanquish simply because 
Rutgers was next on the schedule. 
Much of it still lingers. But to dismiss 
60 minutes of gameplay, no matter the 
opponent, would be a mistake, par-
ticularly heading toward a legitimate 
test against Iowa next weekend.

The Michigan football team bounced back from its loss at Wisconsin with a 52-0 over Rutgers on Saturday afternoon at the Big House.

Behind 
Patterson, 
‘M’ offense 
rebounds

It took all of two minutes and eight 
seconds Saturday afternoon.
Two minutes and eight seconds for 
Shea Patterson to find Nico Collins on a 
48-yard touchdown down the sideline.
Two minutes and eight seconds for 
Collins to sprint toward his teammates, 
shoulder bumping Mike Sainristil and 
Tarik Black in celebration.
Two minutes and eight seconds 
for Michigan to discover its offensive 
groove after four vexing weeks of 
trying.
The natural caveat, of course, is the 
Wolverines’ opponent. Rutgers ranks 
118th of 130 FBS teams in ESPN’s 
adjusted 
efficiency 
metric. 
Even 
Michigan’s backups had no trouble 
shredding the Scarlet Knights en route 
to a 52-0 win.
But four weeks ago, the same could 
have been said of Middle Tennessee 
State, which ranks 122nd in the same 
metric. That night, the Wolverines left 
Michigan Stadium with a 40-21 win that 
prompted more questions than answers. 
Saturday, they did the opposite.
“Josh Gattis, all the offense coaches 
and offensive players, the precision they 
had, they improved and it showed,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. “Put 
together a really good gameplan and 
the players knew it. … And it’s good to 
see it paid off in a victory that was much 
needed.”
Through three games, the questions 
swirling over Michigan’s offensive 
identity were unavoidable. In week 
two’s overtime win over Army, the 
Wolverines ran 14 more times than they 
passed, including an inexplicable run 
of 13 straight rushing plays at the end 
of regulation. Last week, en route to a 
21-point loss at Wisconsin, Michigan 
gained just 40 yards on the ground, 
opting for an air game that proved 
equally ineffective.
At the center of it all was Patterson. 
It’s a natural place for a quarterback 
to sit when his team struggles, but 
Patterson’s start to the season only 
added fuel to the fire.
His completion percentage was down 
nine points from a year ago. His yards 
per attempt had dropped from 8.0 to 7.0. 
On the ground, he had dropped from 21 
yards per game to three.
Saturday afternoon, he was back to 
his old self. The final line — 17-for-23 for 
276 yards, four total touchdowns and an 
interception — says it all.
“Any time after a loss like that, it 
can go two ways,” Patterson said. “And 
we worked hard every single day in 
practice, trusted the game plan. I just 
really like the way we responded as a 
team.”
Patterson’s natural reaction when 
he’s asked about himself is to deflect. 
When the questions inevitably came 
Saturday, he credited the coaches’ 
gameplan, the offensive line’s pass 
protection, the receivers for getting 
open and the defense for advantageous 
field position. Not once did he mention 
himself.
But ask anyone else and you’ll find out 
what Patterson means to this team.
“Shea’s one of the best guys I know 
about handling his mentality,” said 
sophomore running back Christian 
Turner. “Media likes to bash him and 
stuff like that, but Shea’s a baller and we 
all believe in Shea and Shea believes in 
us.”
If you don’t believe him, you could 
just watch the game.
All afternoon, Patterson was clicking. 
Two plays in, he found Ronnie Bell for 
a 14-yard gain that would have been 
his second-biggest of the first three 
quarters against Wisconsin. A minute 
later came the touchdown to Collins. 
On the next drive, it only took him two 
completions to get Michigan inside the 
Rutgers’ five-yard line, because the 
second of those was a perfectly thrown 
deep ball to Donovan Peoples-Jones on 
the left sideline.
Three plays later, he strolled into the 
end zone untouched for his first rushing 
touchdown of the year.
“He did really good,” Peoples-Jones 
said. “Sat back there and made some 
really good throws. His reads. Every 
assignment that he did, he did well 
today.”
As for the questions about Michigan’s 
offensive identity? Those came with 
a notably different twist — is this your 
identity, not what is your identity?
“It 
definitely 
helps,” 
Peoples-
Jones said of the connection between 
Patterson’s 
performance 
and 
the 
Wolverines’ identity.
“… 
Whenever 
he 
plays 
good, 
everybody plays good.”

Forward depth creates line challenges for Pearson

Filling in the lineup each night 
will be quite the task for Mel 
Pearson this season.
The Michigan coach will be 
forced to narrow down the 17 
forwards on the roster to just 
12 for each game, possibly 13 
if he chooses to dress an extra 
forward as opposed to an extra 
defenseman. And when you look 
down the list, there are few — if 
any — players that are easy to 
leave out.
Since practice began three 
weeks ago, Pearson has focused 
on 
getting 
the 
Wolverines’ 
five new forwards up to speed 
on Michigan’s systems on the 
forecheck and in the defensive 
zone. But while doing that, 
he’s put together different line 
combinations every few days 
to try to get a sense for which 
players fit where in the lineup.
“You’re just trying to see what 
type of plays they can make 
offensively and if they can read 
off each other,” Pearson said 
Thursday. “You’re just looking 
for chemistry on the line, and 
you can see it. You can tell guys 
come down the ice and there’s 
just nothing there. No creativity, 
no passes, just (nothing).”
Chemistry can be a fickle thing 
to pinpoint. Sometimes it’s visible 
right away, as Pearson says, 
and sometimes it takes time to 
develop. If there isn’t chemistry 
right away, it’s hard to know if it 
will never come or if it’s just going 
to take more time to develop.
“It could take a week or two 
before you start clicking with 
someone, so the biggest thing 
is to have that open mindset of 
just trying to figure out and get 
rolling with who you’re playing 
with,” said senior forward Nick 
Pastujov. “If right from the bat 
you’re like, ‘Me and this guy don’t 
mesh,’ every single time you mess 
up, you’re just gonna be looking at 
that (as proof).
“If you look at it in a more 
positive light like, ‘OK, we 

messed up this rep but why was 
that?’ and try to get to the root of 
the problem, you can progress a 
lot faster.”
By moving the forwards to 
different lines in practice, Pearson 
has the opportunity to see how 
a wide range of combinations 
work. It also affords players 
who only played on one specific 
line last year a chance to test out 
other groupings.
Sophomore 
forwards Garrett 
van Wyhe and 
Nolan 
Moyle 
spent the vast 
majority of last 
season on a line 
with 
junior 
forward Dakota 
Raabe, and the 
trio 
finished 
the 
season 
as 
one of Pearson’s 
favorite lines. But it’s a new year, 
and Pearson doesn’t want any of 
them to feel like they can only 
play together.
“The thing about that line 
is you could put them together 
tomorrow and they’d be great,” 
Pearson said. “You know you 
have that. You know you have 
that in your pocket so to speak, 

where the other guys, if you put 
them together, you don’t know 
what you’re going to get. So, we’ll 
always have that.
“I don’t know if they’ll be 
together or not. I don’t want to 
pigeonhole anyone to think they 
only can play on that line or they 
only can play in a certain role.”
With 
just 
under 
a 
week 
until the Wolverines face the 
University 
of 
Windsor 
in 
an 
exhibition 
matchup, 
Pearson 
has 
time 
to 
figure 
out 
his 
line 
combinations. 
Adding intrigue 
to the puzzle of 
which 
players 
go 
where 
is 
freshman 
forward Johnny 
Beecher.
Beecher was selected No. 30 
overall by the Boston Bruins 
in this year’s NHL Draft and is 
known for his size and speed, as 
well as his ability to shoot the 
puck. But Beecher is only in his 
first season of college hockey, so 
the players Pearson surrounds 
him with will need to have the 

ability to both keep up with him 
and show him the ropes of college 
gameplay.
“You’d like to play with him an 
upperclassman or two that can 
talk to him,” Pearson said. “It 
doesn’t need to be, and shouldn’t 
be, always the coach that is 
coaching the player. That’s when 
you have a really good team, 
you’ve got the seniors and juniors 
who can take a player like Johnny 
and work with him and coach 
him on the bench.
“...I 
think 
that’s 
really 
important that you find the right 
guy that he will listen to and 
someone who can communicate 
with him, almost like a player-
coach.”
Pearson pointed to senior 
forwards Jake Slaker and Will 
Lockwood 
as 
players 
who 
have communicated well with 
Beecher thus far. It isn’t hard 
to imagine a situation in which 
Slaker, Beecher and Lockwood 
fill out Michigan’s top line.
The question then becomes 
which of the other 14 forwards 
get the nine remaining spots up 
front for the Wolverines. It’s a 
good problem to have, but it’s one 
Pearson will need some time to 
solve.

‘M’ holds off Purdue

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
soccer team formed a circle and 
started dancing, jumping and 
screaming prior to their game 
against 
Purdue. 
Moments 
later, they were screaming 
again — this time to celebrate 
sophomore midfielder Raleigh 
Loughman’s 
goal 
just 
49 
seconds into the game. 
The early goal helped the 
Wolverines 
(8-2-0 
overall, 
3-0-0 Big Ten) to a 2-1 victory 
in rainy conditions over the 
Boilermakers (6-3-1, 2-1-0). 
Michigan used the energy 
of this goal to keep the 
pressure on Purdue, forcing 
its goaltender, Marisa Bova, 
to make several 
saves 
under 
duress. 
“We 
came 
out 
on 
fire,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Jennifer 
Klein. “Scoring 
a goal in the 
first 
minute 
really set the 
tone.”
Junior 
midfielder Sarah Stratigakis 
played a large part in this fast 
start. She relentlessly attacked 
Purdue’s defense early, coming 
away with three shots in 
the first 20 minutes. But the 
Wolverines could not find a 
goal to add to their lead. 
After halftime, Michigan 
finally broke through on a 
set piece. Freshman forward 
Danielle Wolfe made a run up 
the left-hand side of the field 
and won a free kick just outside 
the box. Instead of shooting the 
free kick, Loughman played 
a through ball to Stratigakis. 
This caught the Boilermaker’s 
defense off guard and allowed 
Stratigakis to place the ball 
into the bottom right corner of 
the goal, just beyond the reach 
of a diving Bova. 

“That’s definitely something 
we’ve worked on in training,” 
Loughman said. “We have a 
few different set pieces we like 
to play and that’s one of them.”
The idea of practice concepts 
translating to the game was 
key throughout the night. 
“I was really happy with 
them 
just 
executing 
our 
gameplan,” Klein said. “(They 
did) the things that we worked 
on throughout the week.”
Michigan played well in 
wide areas and constantly 
switched the point of attack — 
both ideas worked on during 
the week — but its main 
emphasis was on possession of 
the ball.
“Purdue (had) the ability 
to catch us just with their 
attacking 
personalities,” 
said Klein. “We 
knew that our 
best 
defense 
was 
going 
to 
be keeping the 
ball.”
Throughout 
the game, this 
emphasis 
was 
evident, as the 
Wolverines 
had 68 percent possession, 
quickly winning the ball back 
whenever they lost it and 
rarely letting Purdue out of its 
half. 
Klein’s plan to control the 
Boilermakers’ attack worked, 
as junior goaltender Hillary 
Beall only had to make one 
save. 
Purdue’s 
lone 
goal 
came off a deflection from 
a Michigan player with 10 
minutes left. 
The 
Wolverines 
did 
not 
allow the Boilermakers an 
opportunity to equalize, as 
they followed the gameplan 
and kept the ball in Purdue’s 
half to finish the game.
As the final whistle blew, 
Michigan celebrated in the 
same way it started — singing 
and dancing in one big group.

Michigan sweeps Ohio State in 
dramatic fashion at Crisler Center

Queen’s 
“Don’t 
Stop 
Me 
Now” rattled through Crisler 
Center, jolting Michigan fans 
and players to dance as the 
Michigan 
volleyball 
team 
headed 
into 
the 
third 
set 
leading, 2-0. The Wolverines 
(9-3 overall, 2-0 Big Ten) 
dominated the first two sets 
and 
were 
met 
with 
little 
resistance from their rival Ohio 
State (8-6, 1-1). It was all good 
vibes at Crisler in the volleyball 
version of ‘The Game.’
Michigan, in the words of 
Queen, was having itself a good 
time. The Wolverines finished 
off the Buckeyes in three sets to 
sweep their rival — 25-14, 25-17, 
25-19. 
“Matches 
like 
this 
give 
you a ton of confidence,” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen 
after the match. “It’s earned. 
You 
can’t 
give 
somebody 
confidence, it’s earned, and so I 
thought tonight we did a great 
job.”
The Michigan offense tore 

apart Ohio State’s defense for 
three sets. Sophomore outside 
hitter Paige Jones and senior 
setter MacKenzi Welsh led the 
Wolverines offensively. Jones 
dominated the attacking game 
with 14 kills and a .483 hitting 
percentage. Welsh added to 
the 
offensive 
performance 
with 36 assists. Senior outside 
hitter 
Sydney 
Wetterstrom 
didn’t make a positive impact 
on the stat sheet. Wetterstrom 
struggled with six attacking 
errors 
and 
a 
.167 
hitting 
percentage. 
“She’s struggled a little bit 
offensively lately,” Rosen said. 
“She’ll get better. She’ll figure 
it out. She’s a good offensive 
player, but the fact that she’s 
finding other ways to make an 
impact and really impact us in a 
positive way.” 
But her energy and positive 
attitude kept the team going 
throughout the match. 
“I think it’s a great example 
for other players,” Rosen said. 
“That’s a senior who kind of gets 
it. I don’t know if she would’ve 
done that as a freshman, so it’s 

great for other players to see 
that’s the way you respond.”
Michigan was also boosted 
by self-inflicted wounds from 
Ohio State, with a surplus of 
mistakes including 16 errors 
between serving, attacking and 
ball handling. The Buckeyes’ 
errors allowed Michigan to go 
on substantial runs in every 
set — most notably a 14-5 
run to close out the first set. 
These Michigan runs forced 
Ohio State to use all of its 
timeouts in each set, proving 
the Wolverines’ dominance in 
this game. In a rivalry game, 
it counts for more than just 
a number in the win column, 
especially in the fashion that 
Michigan won.
“Knowing that there’s such 
an actual rivalry versus just 
two schools, it’s really cool 
and 
it’s 
super 
emotional,” 
Welsh said. “Knowing that this 
rivalry game means a lot to our 
program, and not just Michigan 
as a whole, is super cool to go 
out and play in these games and 
fight for everything that our 
program means.”

Wolverines dispatch Indiana, 5-0

Dominate.
That’s what the Michigan 
field hockey team (6-2 overall, 
1-1 Big Ten) did Friday afternoon 
in their Big Ten opener against 
Indiana (4-4, 0-1).
For some teams, playing on the 
road for the conference opener 
would pose a problem, but for the 
Wolverines it resulted in a 5-0 
shutout of the Hoosiers.
After eight saves by Indiana 
goalkeeper Sachi Ananias in 
the first 10 minutes, Michigan 
didn’t lose hope of scoring first. 
Ten minutes into the game, 
sophomore midfielder Kathryn 
Peterson lined up for a corner. 
Redshirt sophomore midfielder 
Emma Tamer received it and took 
a shot up the middle. Another 
save by Ananias forced the 
ball back into play when senior 
midfielder Fay Keijer connected, 
catching Ananias off gaurd to 
give the Wolverines their first 
goal of the night. 

“We 
were 
really 
putting 
emphasis 
on 
getting 
to 
rebounds,” 
Keijer 
said. 
“My 
teammates really set me up by 
getting those good shots on goal.”
The concentrated emphasis 
on small details mattered just 
seconds after the first goal as 
the Wolverines took advantage 

of poor passes and forced three 
Indiana turnovers over the next 
minute. Eventually the turnovers 
led to another Michigan corner, 
this time by Keijer. She inserted 
the ball to Tamer, who found the 
back of the net for the Wolverines’ 
second goal of the night. 
Michigan’s 
early 
offensive 

domination set the tone for the 
rest of the game as it scored 
three more goals, one in each 
remaining quarter. The third 
came late in the second quarter 
as Indiana gave up yet another 
corner. Again, Peterson inserted 
the ball, this time to senior 
midfielder Guadalupe Fernandez 
Lacor, who sent a shot up the 
middle. Another save by Ananias 
launched the ball into the air 
where Keijer connected, and hit 
it back into the net.
“When it came high up in the 
air, I was just looking at the ball,” 
Keijer said. “(Michigan coach) 

Marcia (Pankratz) always tells us 
to bunt it.” 
Keijer’s focus gave her two 
goals on the night, already tying 
her mark from last season.
The fourth goal came from 
junior midfielder Kayla Reed, 
with a cross-field pass from 
freshman 
midfielder 
Nina 
Apoola. 
With 
a 
flick 
over 
Ananias’s head, the Wolverines’ 
were up 4-0.
Sophomore 
forward 
Tina 
D’Anjollel contributed the fifth 
goal off another penalty corner. 
Indiana 
allowed 
Michigan 
ten 
penalty 
corners, 
which 
the Wolverines used to their 
advantage, scoring three of the 
five goals off them.
While Michigan dominated 
on 
the 
offensive 
side, 
the 
Wolverines’ defense also only 
allowed the Hoosiers one shot 
on goal, and it came late in the 
fourth quarter. 
After a preseason full of tough 
opponents, Michigan was ready 
to prove itself in the Big Ten, and 
prove themselves the Wolverines 
did. They dominated on both 
sides of the field and started their 
conference season on a high note.
“It was a really big game for us 
because it was our first Big Ten 
game,” Keijer said. “You always 
want to set the tone. We’re ready 
to take on the Big Ten and make a 
good run.”

For offensive coordinator Josh Gattis, a necessary step forward

Josh Gattis paced near the 
30-yard 
line 
shortly 
before 
kickoff, 
embracing 
players 
scattered about. He walked up 
to midfield, then back again. 
Safeties coach Chris Partridge 
approached 
and 
offered 
an 
emphatic hug.
As Gattis walked toward the 
middle of the offensive huddle, 
ready to address his beleaguered 
unit before taking the field 
against Rutgers, one could only 
imagine the thoughts going 
through his head.
Since the moment he got 
the job, the spotlight of this 
Michigan football season has 
concentrated on him, and on 
his promise of change. Through 
three weeks, that promised 
growth has been noticeably 
absent. 
For Saturday’s bout, Gattis 
decided 
to 
change 
course. 
Instead of sitting in the press 
box directing the offense, he 
decided to run the offense from 
the sideline. Spearheading a unit 
in search of an identity, Gattis 
felt his presence on the field 
could centralize that quest.
“I think this group really 
leans on leadership and they 
need it,” Gattis said on the 
pregame radio show. “To be on 
the field, to be able to provide 
that leadership, in good and bad 
times, it’s something I think that 
I want to encourage out of our 
guys. … Slept on it all week long, 
going through my mind, and 
it’s about what these kids need 
most. It’s not about what I need, 
it’s not about anything else. 
“It’s about what the kids need. 
And they need it.”
It’s difficult to say what 
tangible impact his move had 
on Michigan’s 52-0 demolition 
over Rutgers — though it’s hard 
to imagine anything altering the 
outcome. But the importance of 
such a move was not lost on his 
players.
“All week, he emphasized 

believing in his players, and we 
just have to believe in him,” said 
junior running back Christian 
Turner. “I think him being on 
the sideline just emphasized that 
even more.”
For Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh, 
Gattis’ presence 
on the sideline 
also 
clarified 
some 
of 
the 
intricacies 
underlying many 
of the questions 
about 
this 
offense.
“For Josh to 
be there as the plays are being 
formulated, he can react to the 
kind of subs he wants in the 
game, who he wants running a 

particular route or play. It flowed 
much better today,” Harbaugh 
said. “It could still be better, the 
operation and mechanics of it. 
But I thought it took a big leap 
today.”
Between 
plays, he’d hold 
up a hand signal, 
frequently 
a 
number, 
which 
would then be 
mimicked by two 
offensive staffers 
by 
his 
side. 
Staffers 
would 
hold 
up 
two 
signs behind him 
with an image — 
anything from a military tank 
to bug spray, pairs of leggings 
to a Detroit Red Wings logo. 
From there, Gattis would often 

bark marching orders to certain 
players, specifically receivers 
who looked back at him for last-
second instructions.
All 
the 
while 
Harbaugh 
stood nearby, though distant 
enough. When 
the 
offense 
necessitated 
a 
huddle, 
it 
was Gattis in 
the 
center, 
Harbaugh 
standing 
on 
the 
periphery. 
When confusion 
arose, 
it 
was 
up to Gattis to 
signal timeout. 
The two coaches sometimes 
conversed between plays, and 
regularly did so between drives. 
Sometimes, they’d turn to a 

whiteboard to demonstrate their 
ideas conceptually.
But there were no ambiguities. 
This was Gattis’ show, as it has 
been since the day he arrived.
“I thought (communication) 
was 
better,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“Everything 
was better face-
to-face 
— 
me 
communicating 
with 
him, 
him 
communicating 
with 
players, 
players hearing it 
from him and not 
going through the 
box. It was good. 
It was a good move. Glad we did 
it.”
At times, Gattis’ demeanor — 
branded as fiery and emotional 

— neared a boiling point. After 
an illegal motion penalty on 
freshman receiver Giles Jackson 
in the first quarter, Gattis 
furiously marched onto the edge 
of the field to substitute him off. 
At the next intermission, the 
two calmly talked it out. Not a 
voice through a radio. Person-
to-person.
At others, though, he opted 
for 
measured 
conversation. 
After Patterson’s interception on 
an under-thrown ball to junior 
Nico 
Collins, 
Gattis 
hardly 
appeared frustrated. He brought 
Patterson over, calmly pointed 
to the video screen, then made a 
hand gesture to suggest a tweak.
“I think coach Gattis is 
without a doubt kind of the 
leader of our offense,” Patterson 
said. “I think we all trust in him. 
Like I said, we see it every day in 
practice, so it was just a little bit 
more personal.”
Whether 
his 
presence 
on the field had any direct 
impact on play-calling or game 
management is only part and 
parcel 
to 
its 
intention. 
As 
Michigan’s new coach tries to 
forge a connection with his 
team, and with it something 
resemblant of an identity, his 
presence alone offers value. 
Maybe it was little more than 
a symbolic gesture, but when 
building trust, symbols matter.
“It’s a familiar face on the 
sideline with us,” Turner said. 
“Seeing his emotion after plays, 
whether good or bad, I think 
that definitely helped.”
As the score continued to 
widen and the starting unit took 
a breather, Gattis’ demeanor 
grew more relaxed. It was just 
a win, and one against a team 
destined for Big Ten bottom-
dwelling, but the sense of relief 
was palpable.
Slowly, time ticked away, and 
the loss at Wisconsin continued 
to fade from memory. The clock 
finally hit zero. Gattis unfolded 
his arms, embraced his team 
and, for the first time all year, 
took a confident stride forward.

RUCHITA IYER/Daily
Michigan offensive coordinator Josh Gattis called plays from the sideline on Saturday, a marked shift from the first three games of the season when he was in the booth.

All week, he 
emphasized 
believing in his 
players.

Everything was 
better face-to-
face. ... Glad we 
did it.

Against Scarlet Knights, Wolverines get contributions from new faces 

Let’s cut right to the chase. On 
Saturday, the Michigan football 
team beat Rutgers, 52-0. It was 
such a bad performance for the 
Scarlet Knights that they fired their 
coach the next day.
So, for the Wolverines, that 
meant that most of the regular 
starters were out of the game by 
the third quarter and others had a 
chance to shine.
There were a lot of contributors 
you might not be familiar with, 
younger players who suddenly 
showed up and made an impact. 
The Daily introduces you to some 
of those players, what they did and 
what it could mean for the future:
Sophomore linebacker Cam 
McGrone
McGrone got the start at middle 
linebacker in place of Josh Ross, 
who was out with an injury. He 
made several eye-popping plays and 
was all over Rutgers quarterback 

Artur Sitkowski in blitz packages. 
Though he was credited with just 
one tackle and one quarterback 
hurry, it was clear that McGrone’s 
speed could be a difference-maker.
“If he keeps playing like this, 
he’s gonna be a star,” Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh said after the 
game. “The way he runs, again, he 
played really well last week, but 
his physicality is just really, every 
week, going higher and higher.”
McGrone has also proved to 
be a larger-than-life presence off 
the field, making the kinds of bold 
press conference proclamations 
that players like Chase Winovich 
used to have.
Most notably, McGrone offered 
up a prediction that Michigan 
would rebound from its early 
struggles.
“We know we’re gonna see 
(Wisconsin) again in Indy, my 
hometown, 
for 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Championship,” McGrone said. “ 
… I know when we see them again, 
we’re gonna smack them in the 

mouth.”
Though 
he 
drew 
some 
comparisons to Devin Bush with 
his 
sideline-to-sideline 
speed, 
McGrone isn’t going to be that 
guy right away. He’s still raw, 
and he showed that in the loss to 
Wisconsin, where he struggled as 
Ross’ replacement. But if McGrone 
adds a little more polish, the 
Wolverines might have another 
great linebacker on their hands.
Freshman safety Dax Hill
Early in the second quarter, 
Michigan stalled on an offensive 
drive for the first time all game. 
Will Hart’s punt wasn’t great — it 
traveled just 41 yards — but just 
as the Scarlet Knights’ returner 
caught the ball, Hill flew in his 
face, leveling him and preventing a 
return. As Hill walked off the field, 
he wagged his fingers, a warning to 
future kick returners everywhere.
“The punt coverage was such a 
big thing from last week to this. Last 
week he was a gunner and pretty 
much in that same similar position 

and was hesitant,” Harbaugh said. 
“And all you really had to do was 
just coach him on it and that’s what 
he did and no hesitation today, you 
saw him make one of those big-
time plays as a gunner.”
Hill — a five-star recruit — was 
expected to contribute right away, 
but he’s been largely absent in the 
first few games. Saturday, then, 
was somewhat of Hill’s coming-
out party. In addition to his 
contribution on special teams, Hill 
saw time at safety in the second 
half, finishing with four total 
tackles and 0.5 tackles for loss.
He, too, is a player who could 
make a difference on defense with 
his speed, and the coaching staff 
already seems to have seen enough 
to give him more of a look.
“He just keeps coming, keeps 
coming along and he’s growing as 
a football player very quickly and 
he’s so fast and that speed shows 
up,” Harbaugh said. “It shows up 
when it shows up and you see it, 
you see it with Dax Hill, you see it 
with Cam McGrone, you see the 
guys like that, so he’s come along. 
… I probably predict he’ll be getting 
more and more time.”
Redshirt 
freshman 
quarterback Joe Milton
In Madison, the Wolverines’ 
normal 
backup 
quarterback, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Dylan 
McCaffrey, took a big hit and went 
down with a concussion. With that, 
Milton, usually the third-string, 
slotted into the backup role.

Though Milton has a cannon 
for an arm, he has struggled with 
accuracy in the past and is seen as 
turnover prone. But on Saturday, 
he came in during the third quarter 
with the game long over and 
provided about as good an audition 
as he could hope for against the 
hapless Scarlet Knights.
“He’s a leader,” said sophomore 
running back Christian Turner. 
“He doesn’t have the starting 
job right now, he knows that, but 
he doesn’t go out there and be 
lackadaisical or not being fully 
there. He knows what he’s doing. 
He’s just a good guy to have out 
there.”
The offense kept humming with 
Milton in the shotgun. He ran a 
bootleg for a touchdown early in 
the fourth quarter and later threw 
for another.
Milton won’t see the field 
much this year with two more 
experienced signal-callers in front 
of him, but he’s popular among his 
teammates and if he plays well in 
limited time, he could carve out a 
bigger role next year.
“I’ve been waiting for him to get 
his chance,” McGrone said. “Seeing 
him in the end zone, it warmed my 
heart a little bit, man. I’m pulling 
for that guy, man.”
Other skill-position players
Sophomore 
running 
back 
Hassan 
Haskins 
spent 
2018 
confined to special teams. He 
appeared at running back against 
Middle Tennessee and Wisconsin, 

but had just three combined 
attempts for negative-three yards.
On Saturday, Haskins got an 
extended look with the score out of 
hand and two of the Wolverines’ top 
three backs coming off of injuries. 
He was Michigan’s second-leading 
rusher on the day, gaining 45 yards 
on nine attempts, and had a game-
high 15-yard rush.
Haskins 
is 
blocked 
from 
extended playing time by Turner, 
senior Tru Wilson and freshman 
Zach Charbonnet, but Haskins 
seems to have secured himself 
as the No. 4 option and a capable 
replacement 
if 
Wilson 
and 
Charbonnet continue to struggle 
with injuries.
Freshman wide receiver Giles 
Jackson flashed some stuff with a 
23-yard touchdown from Milton 
in the fourth quarter. Though 
he is even more blocked than 
Haskins, with four older, mega-
talented receivers in front of 
him, Jackson has been given the 
chance to showcase his speed as 
Michigan’s primary kick returner 
— he returned one kick for 13 yards 
Saturday — and has stood out from 
the pack a little more than any of 
the Wolverines’ other freshman 
receivers.
“It’s the freshmen out there 
now and we’ll see what they can 
do,” Harbaugh said. “And they got 
valuable reps and they played well, 
they’ve been getting a lot of work. ... 
Good to see them execute the plays 
that were called.”
