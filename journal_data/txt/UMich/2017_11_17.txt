Featuring visual art, poetry 

and 
performances 
from 

University of Michigan students 
and organizations about the 
experiences of immigrant and 
first-generation students at the 
University, 
the 
Shift 
Talent 

Showcase drew a crowd of 100 
students, faculty and Ann Arbor 
community members to the 
Pendleton Room of the Michigan 
Union Thursday night. 

Hosted 
by 
University 

organizations 
Redefine, 
Call 

for Humanity, the Iraqi Student 
Association, Refugees To College, 
Students Organize for Syria and 
Zeta Omega Eta, the showcases 
highlighted 
performers 
and 

artists on campus who seek to 
express their individual cultures 
and create dialogue for social 
issues.

Prior to the performances, 

attendees 
circulated 
in 
the 

back of Pendleton, browsing 
photo exhibits and illustrations 
by 
University 
students 
and 

the Jewish Family Services of 
Washtenaw County, a refugee 
resettlement organization. The 
exhibits 
and 
performances 

displayed themes of cultural 
individuality, acceptance in the 
United States and combatting 
cultural stereotypes.

According 
to 
LSA 
junior 

Mariam Reda, a cofounder of 
Redefine and organizer of the 
event, the idea for Shift was 
developed in August and is 

Redefine’s first event. She said 
the founders wanted to focus on 
cross-cultural 
communication 

and art.

“We thought that, in the 

campus climate right now, it’s 
really necessary for students of 
all different backgrounds and 
ethnic groups to come together in 
one room with all their creative 
talents and be able to discuss one 
topic and I feel like, right now, 
it’s a really good time to have 

something like this happen,” 
Reda said. “Through this, we 
really just try to promote the 
connection 
and 
congregation 

between art and social justice.”

Cultural 
exhibitions 
from 

regions including the Middle 
East, Brazil, India, the Bahamas, 
Puerto Rico and others were 
included in Shift.

The 
performance 
element 

of Shift kicked off with a 
demonstration 
from 
the 

University’s Capoeira Club, an 
organization on campus that 
practices 
the 
Afro-Brazilian 

form of martial arts. Inviting 
audience members to perform 
and 
play 
instruments 
along 

with the organization fostered 
community among cultures from 
the beginning of the event.

Performances from individual 

students and groups followed, 
including spoken word poetry, 

Earlier 
this 
month, 
the 

University of Michigan took first 
place in the Adobe Analytics 
Challenge. The challenge focuses 
on giving college students access 
to Adobe’s analytics products 
and 
data 
from 
real-world 

organizations 
and 
companies. 

This year the groups analyzed 
MGM Resorts International, using 
data science to compete for the 
grand prize of $35,000. 

This year’s team, “Adjusted 

R Squared,” was comprised of 
three Business graduate students: 
Rajiv Khattar, Rei Liao and Erica 
Kirshensteyn, along with their 
academic adviser, Prof. Hyun-Soo 
Ahn.

Kirshensteyn said though they 

did not know each other before 
they got started, they quickly 
became a very strong team.

“The 
call 
for 
teams 
was 

fairly early on in our programs, 
so admittedly, our group was 
somewhat randomly assembled,” 
Kirshensteyn 
said. 
“However, 

our various backgrounds and 
perspectives complemented each 
other, with Rajiv coming from HR

Eight months after Ann Arbor 

City Council approved a $200,000 
review of the practices and policies 
of the city’s police department 
by the Chicago-based security 
firm Hillard Heintze LLC, many 
residents and City Councilmembers 
expected 
the 
review 
would 

result in the recommendation 
to create a citizen oversight 
board. The firm has released its 
comprehensive 105-page report on 
the department, which includes 67 
recommendations. Chief among 
those is the recommendation to 
create what many residents see 
as a watered-down version of an 
oversight board –– what Hillard 
Heintze is calling a “Co-Produced 
Policing Committee”. 

Unlike a civilian oversight board, 

the CPPC would not have the power 
to conduct its own investigations 
of complaints against the AAPD 
–– 
instead, 
it 
would 
review 

investigations conducted by the 
AAPD’s office of internal affairs 
and communicate with AAPD 
regarding such investigations on 
behalf of the community.

Thursday night, a large, 

painted 
cube 
sat 
in 
the 

Diag and invited passersby 
to chalk their answers to 
questions such as: “What is a 
mystery that can’t be solved?” 
The cube, along with hot 
chocolate, donuts and glow 
sticks were featured for the 
reveal of TedxUofM’s 2018 
conference 
theme: 
“Black 

Box.”

While the speakers have 

yet to be announced, eight 
University 
of 
Michigan 

affiliates will present talks in 
February, all centered around 
the idea of “Black Box.” 
Kinesiology 
senior 
Jackie 

Katz, 
co-director 
of 
the 

conference, said selecting a 
theme was a lengthy process.

“We chose ‘Black Box’ this 

year kind of with the idea of 
when you know the input and 
you know the output, but you 
don’t know what’s happening 
on the inside,” Katz said. “It’s 

like a mystery that needs to be 
solved, kind of like unknown. 
Also, the black box is a term 
for the recording device in 
an airplane, so it holds the 
secrets.”

TedxUofM aims to select 

an 
inclusive 
theme 
that 

will work for a variety of 
speakers and strive to find a 
concept that will excite their 
audience. Business sophomore 
Neil Desai, attendees lead 
co-director, 
said 
he 
was 

impressed with the reaction 
within the membership to 
this year’s selection.

“Black Box is kind of unique 

because someone shouted it 
out at one of our meetings, 
and right away, the immediate 
reaction was like ‘ooh, wow,’ 
and everyone just started 
talking,” Desai said. “That’s 
the biggest thing, we want 
people to be talking about this 
theme.”

Engineering senior Umang 

Lathia, TedxUofM speaker 
coach, said members research

After CSG passes resolution to encourage ‘U’ to divest, students concerned for safety

During 
Tuesday 
night’s 

Central 
Student 
Government 

meeting, which extended into 
early Wednesday morning, the 
resolution to call for a committee 
within 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Board of Regents to 
investigate and consider divesting 
from 
companies 
allegedly 

involved in Palestinian human 
rights violations passed for the 
first time in the University’s Ann 

Arbor campus history. The results 
of this vote were met with a wide 
range of intense emotions from 
students across campus as well as 
attendees of the public meeting.

For those in support of the 

resolution, 
the 
announcement 

of the final vote — 23 in favor, 17 
against and 5 abstained — yielded 
hugs and tears of joy followed by 
celebration outside the Modern 
Languages 
Building. 
One 

member of Students Allied for 
Freedom and Equality, the group 
that proposed the resolution, 
contrasted these tears from those 

of disappointment shed in years 
past by resolution supporters. 

“We see tears after every 

resolution for people that want 
it to pass because we’re so sad 
that it didn’t pass. But the tears 
this time, it was tears of joy, tears 
of disbelief, and people were 
really sobbing because it was 
so unprecedented,” the SAFE 
member, who asked to remain 
anonymous for safety concerns, 
explained.

They spoke of one Palestinian 

student who, before coming to 
the University, was urged by 

family members to choose a 
different university because of the 
marginalization of Palestinian 
voices the family had seen on 
campus. When the results were 
announced, the SAFE member 
explained, this student fell to the 
ground in astonishment.

LSA 
senior 
Hafsa 
Tout 

explained the atmosphere of 
the room as the results were 
announced. They especially noted 
the uncertainty they felt that the 
resolution would pass.

On 
Wednesday 
night, 

members and students of the 
social 
justice 
organization 

Radfun projected an image 
onto the UMMA in support of 
having University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
and 
the 

Board of Regents deny white 
nationalist Richard Spencer 
the opportunity to speak on 
campus.

Radfun, 
which 
describes 

itself as “radical anticapitalist 
deviants & forum of united 
nonconformists,” 
used 
a 

projector to place the image 
of Spencer being punched 
in the face alongside the 
message about denying him 
the 
opportunity 
to 
speak. 

The organization came into 

the spotlight by covering up 
the C.C. Little Building’s sign 
in early October in response 
to the protests against Little 
from earlier that month.

The 
projection 
was 

broadcasted for an hour and 
a half for passing students to 
see. 

LSA senior Kelly Garland, a 

member of Radfund, expressed 
concerns that the potential of 
Spencer’s visit was not being 
discussed in the student body.

“When 
we’ve 
been 
out 

talking to people about Richard 
Spencer a large number just 
don’t even know who he is and 
aren’t aware he is asking to 
come to our campus,” Garland 
said. “We see this as a problem 
because we think that the 
small group of students who 
is aware of these things asking 
the administration is easily 

ignored.”

Members 
of 
Radfund, 

including 
LSA 
senior 
Hoi-

An Pham, believe that the 
first amendment protections 
given to protect the right of 
freedom of speech should be 
reexamined and should not 
be applicable to speakers like 
Spencer.

“There are laws in this 

country that are not fair,” Pham 
said. “I think we have to look 
at the fact that there are laws 
in place that are protecting 
Richard 
Spencer, 
but 
are 

these laws actually good laws 
if they’re protecting white 
supremacists and marginalized 
bodies are getting hurt and 
shot in the streets.”

Spencer has become famous, 

in part, due to his lawsuits 
against universities who are 
unwilling to allow him to speak 

on their campuses. Spencer 
has filed lawsuits against 
Ohio State and Michigan 
State for their denials of his 
speaking engagements. 

Garland 
believes 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

should fight Spencer in 
the courts -- where a legal 
precedent 
could 
be 
set 

for denying controversial 
speakers 
on 
college 

campuses.

Schlissel has not stated 

whether or not he will 
deny Spencer’s request to 
speak on campusstating in 
a recent interview: “What 
we do is we look for a time 
and a place, if possible, 
that assures, as much as 
possible, safety, and as 
little disruption to the 
business of the University 
as possible.”

Rick 
Fitzgerald, 

assistant vice president for 
public affairs has said “The 
(U)niversity will carefully 
consider 
this 
request, 

paying close attention to 
the safety and security of 
our community.”

FRIYAY!
puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

Every Friday, The Michigan 
Daily republishes an article 
from The Daily’s archives from a 
moment in University history. 

August 7, 1957 
— American 

scientists are hatching plot 
against the complacent, ageless 
moon. Missile men of the 
Army and Air Force already 
are deeply into plans to shoot 
the earth’s nearest neighbor. 
The ingenious details of their 
conspiracy are ‘a startling 
reminder of how close man 
himself is to taking the first 
gigantic step through space.

List Plans
The scientists say they will:
1. Send a rocket careening 

around the moon to get some 
closeup pictures of both its 
known and unknown sides and 
bring them back to earth.

2. Actually hit the moon 

with a rocket that might hurl 
grenades fire mortars in an 
effort to find out what the moon 
is made of.

3. Perhaps, in the distant 

future, land a sort of automated 
tank at would roam the lunar 
surface, measuring conditions 
and reporting them back to 
earth.

Authorizes Probes
Earlier this year the Defense 

Department authorized a 
half dozen lunar probes on 
recommendation of the Earth 
Satellite Panel of the United 
States National Committee for 
the International Geophysical 
Year.

“Although it is impossible 

to predict how quickly 
man himself will follow his 
exploring instruments into 
outer space,” the panel said, 
“the inevitable culmination 
of his efforts will be manned 
space flight and his landing on 
the nearer planets. It is clear 
that he will develop the ability 
to do this and it is hard to 
conceive of mankind stopping 
short when such a tempting 
goal is within reach.”

The moon is a mere 238,000 

miles away-perhaps a couple 
of days by a rocket that takes 
time to pick its course. When 
scientists eventually make the 
trip in person, they will get a 
taste of the difficulties to be 
encountered on later trips to the 
next two space stops, Venus, 28 
million miles away, and Mars, 
48 million miles distant.

For now, however, the 

scientists must content 
themselves with much simpler 
lunar chores- probing for clues 
as to the nature of the moon; 
how it and earth were born and 
perhaps even the origin of the 
universe.

Goals Specified
Their immediate goals are 

to measure the moon’s size 
and weight, its gravity, its 
magnetic field if any and its 
atmosphere or lack of it. A 
rocket that would encircle the 
moon could get part of the job 
done. By charting the rocket’s 
position at regular intervals 
against the background of the 

star-filled universe, scientists 
could compute the pull of the 
moon’s gravity and its mass and 
weight. Sensitive telemetering 
equipment might detect a lunar 
magnetic field.

Error Noted
Estimates of the moon’s 

weight are believed to have a 
possible error of 0.3 per cent-
not much if, you are buying 
a ton of coal. But apply that 
margin to the estimated 
weight of the moon and the 
possible error turns out to be 
237 quintillion, 384 quadrillion 
short tons,

A rocket carrying packages 

of instruments to the surface 
of the moon would improve on 
the earlier measurements and 
perform some new tasks. They 
might even stick a scientific 
thumb into the moon’s surface.

DANYEL THARAKAN/Daily

Olivia Golden, former U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Children and 
Families presents on issues of poverty at the Ford School Thursday.

POLICY PRESE NTATION

with original content from a 
variety of fields.

“We hope that anyone we’re 

choosing is doing things that are 
more pushing the barrier than 
things that are more typical, so 
we try to find speakers that are 
doing 
pushing-edge 
things,” 

Lathia said.

Due 
to 
the 
diversity 
of 

speeches, Katz believes the 
conference will inspire new 
dialogues 
among 
University 

community members.

“All 
the 
speakers 
are 

affiliated with the University 
whether it’s professor, alumni, 

student,” Katz said. “It’s cool 
to get people from the U of M 
community together sharing 
ideas. I think people are all so 
interested and keep coming 
back because the conversation 
it starts with other students in 
the community.”

Though the obvious draw 

to 
the 
conference 
is 
the 

speakers, the attendees team 
creates audience-participation 
activities to break up the four-
hour-long event. Desai, who 
helps create these components, 
said a substantial part of the 
conference 
experience 
is 

interacting with other audience 
members.

“Everyone 
that 
goes 
to 

the 
conference 
is 
always 

passionate,” Desai said. “You 
have the option to livestream 
it, so the people that do decide 
to go are obviously really 
passionate about Ted talks and 
learning something new.”

According to Lathia, curious 

and ambitious people often 
attend the annual conference, 
and the resulting conversations 
are refreshing.

“People get excited about 

things and I think that makes 
such cool conversation because 
you’re not talking to people 
about their school or their 
major, what’s on their daily

inspired by and what they 
actually want to do with their 
life.”

Engineering 
freshman 

Maryam 
Younus 
combined 

multiple spoken word poems 
on preserving cultural identity 
and the impact colonialism and 
Western countries have on foreign 
identities for her performance. She 
said her piece aimed to encourage 
pride in individual cultures.

“No one should feel ashamed 

of who they are and what their 
names mean or any of the labels 
that are associated with that,” 
Younus said. “They shouldn’t feel 
afraid of other people not wanting 
to or not making the effort of 
saying their name properly … (and) 
empowering people to do this, 
empowering people to embrace 
who they are and own that.” 

Reda said the event aimed to 

promote intercultural dialogue 
through mediums like art and 
performance instead of vocal 
speech.

“We’re 
trying 
to 
promote 

a … space on campus where 
any and every talent can really 
come together in one room and 
showcase whatever they want 
about a certain topic and through 
this,” Reda said. “We’re trying to 
set the precedent that dialogue 
does not only have to be through 
speech.”

LSA junior Tariq Mekkaoui said 

Shift not only promoted dialogue 
on immigration and artistic 
expression but also encouraged 
positivity among the performers 
and the audience.

“This was the first event that 

I’ve been to at the University of 
Michigan that really emphasized 
a 
sense 
of 
happiness 
and 

sometimes 
that’s 
forgotten, 

especially 
in 
marginalized 

communities and marginalized 
identities,” 
Mekkaoui 
said. 

“It’s nice just to see a sense of 

culture and identity around this 
central theme of happiness and 
acceptance and it was just nice 
to see all these different orgs 
coming together for that central 
theme 
and 
understand 
that 

diversity can produce happiness 
in ways that I didn’t understand 
before.”

Younus said while events 

like Shift showcase the amount 
of cultural diversity at the 
University, she often encounters 
situations where she is the only 
student in a class wearing a 
headscarf. She said seeing this 
lack of representation in the 
classroom can be daunting but 
events like Shift bring cultures 
together 
in 
a 
positive 
and 

collaborative manner.

“It gets a little discouraging 

sometimes so when you get 
a large group of people like 
this together where you’re all 
embracing each other’s culture 
and learning more about each 
other, it’s refreshing and nice,” 
Younus said.

Adobe Analytics is a multi-

leveled competition requiring a 
range of skills and knowledge. 
The first round consisted of a two-
hour training session to learn the 
program and two weeks to master 
the program, the hardest part in 
this complex competition.

“As far as preparation for our 

submission, a good amount of time 
was spent simply learning how to 
use the tool and which variables 
and fields we needed to conduct 
our 
analysis,” 
Kirshensteyn 

said. “Then, it was a lot of trial 
and error to find the insights we 
ultimately presented. We came up 
with loose hypotheses and areas 
of analysis interest and began 
putting together tables and charts 
we thought might be interesting, 
which led us to looking at the data 
slightly differently and creating 
new analyses we thought might be 
useful.”

Teams analyzed MGM’s data 

in the Adobe Analytics program 
and presented their findings and 
suggestions. Only 15 to 20 teams 
got past this initial screening and 
went on to the semi-final round.

The semi-final judging panel 

consisted 
of 
expert 
analytics 

consultants, who watched each of 
the teams give a web-conference 
presentation, which up to six teams 
passed through to the final rounds 
in Lehi, Utah.

The finals in Utah contained 

mainly 
the 
same 
aspects 
as 

the semi-finals, only at higher 
stakes. Teams had the chance to 
change their slides to add more 
information 
and 
analysis 
and 

present it all in 15 minutes with 
an additional five minutes for 
questions from the judges, who 
were Adobe representatives and 
other experts in the industry.

After the judges were done, 

“Adjusted R Squared” was named 
the first-prize winner of the 
competition. Liao expressed her 
excitement at the announcement.

“We randomly came together 

as a team and I really enjoyed 
getting to know them in a personal 
level through this competition,” 
Liao said. “Both of them are very 
good at interpreting the big data 
in a structural way and drawing 
insights from their professional 
areas, which really inspired me a 
lot. I just can’t thank them enough 
for the tremendous support along 
the way.”

Khattar said she appreciated 

learning about data analytics.

“I definitely want people to 

know that we — both our team 
and other Rossers — can deal 
with data,” Khattar said. “It’s a 
common phrase right now to say 
that data is the new oil. I want 
to continue learning more about 
data analysis and how I can marry 
it with my skills in business to 
become an indispensable part of 
an organization. Tactically, I’m 
currently learning R and SQL to 
help out with some of the ‘harder’ 
data science skills to round out 
some of the more visualization 
work that we did with Adobe.”

the vote I wasn’t sure how it was 
going to go, and in fact I wasn’t 
feeling good about it,” Tout said. 
“I definitely was not expecting it 
to pass, so I was surprised.”

LSA senior Haleemah Aqel, 

a member of SAFE, expressed 
similar 
sentiments 
in 
the 

surprise she has felt since the 
passage of the resolution.

“I just can’t believe it,” she 

said. “Three years later this 
resolution passed and I honestly 
wouldn’t have expected it to 
pass by the time I graduated.”

Aqel, a Palestinian student 

who has visited Palestine five 
times, described the difficult 
experience she faced in 2015 
when, during a visit to the 
nation, she underwent a two-
week lockdown. This incident, 
which she compared to those 
experiences faced by many 
other Palestinians on campus 
while visiting Palestine, she 
explained, follows suit in the 
alleged human rights violations 
committed by companies to be 
investigated as outlined in the 
resolution. 

Students who opposed the 

resolution, however, left the 
meeting upset with the results. 
One student stated, “I think it’s 
a really sad day for freedom of 
thought on this campus,” as she 
exited the auditorium.

LSA 
senior 
Gaby 
Roth, 

a 
member 
of 
University 

of 
Michigan 
Hillel, 
an 

organization 
providing 

programming 
for 
Jewish 

students on campus, and in 
opposition to the resolution, 

explained her reaction in an 
email interview with The Daily.

“I am happy that members 

of SAFE, Palestinian students 
and allies were given a platform 
for their concerns to be heard. 
However, I am deeply upset 
that 
the 
address 
of 
these 

concerns meant that Jewish 
students’ 
sentiments 
about 

feeling 
marginalized 
were 

pushed aside. It is so upsetting 
to me that last night, people 
were pitted against each other 
and that the vote was framed as 
a win or a loss,” she wrote.

Roth 
also 
described 
her 

disappointment in CSG’s vote 
against approving Prof. Victor 
Lieberman, who teaches a class 
on the Arab-Israeli conflict, 
to be included in the lineup of 
speakers for CSG’s Tuesday 
meeting.

University of Michigan Hillel 

circulated an announcement 
following the resolution vote, 
also condemning the decision 
regarding Lieberman. While 
praising students who spoke 
out against divestment and who 
expressed their commitment 
to and relationship with Israel, 
announcement 
describes 

the resolution as “one-sided 
and hurtful” and encourages 
administrators to condemn the 
resolution.

“We trust that the Board of 

Regents will speak out against 
this one-sided resolution, as 
they have in (the) past, and 
remind the campus community 
that they have already rejected 
this resolution when it passed 
at 
University 
of 
Michigan-

Dearborn 
last 
winter,” 
the 

announcement reads. “We also 
hope that the University will 
expand its partnerships with 

Israel, develop new avenues for 
students to study in Israel, and 
encourage faculty to deepen 
their research ties with Israeli 
institutions.”

Several 
students 
took 
to 

social media to express their 
reactions on the resolution’s 
passing. 
Postdoctoral 
fellow 

Austin McCoy, in a public 
Facebook 
post, 
gave 
his 

congratulations to supporters 
and authors of the resolution.

“This is big,” the post reads. 

“It’s taken them years of doing 
the hard work of organizing 
(and defeats), protests, and 
coalition 
building 
to 
get 

this 
resolution 
passed. 
A 

great example of long-term 
organizing featuring a diversity 
of tactics.”

On 
Twitter, 
under 
the 

hashtag #UMDivest, an array 
of opinions could be found by 
those who either supported or 
opposed the resolution.

Other 
divestment 
and 

Students for Justice in Palestine 
groups at universities across 
the country, such as at Ohio 
State University and University 
of 
Wisconsin-Madison, 

acknowledged the resolution’s 
passing via social media.

SAFE sent out a press release 

Wednesday morning describing 
the work of #UMDivest in 
allowing 
Palestinian 
voices 

to be heard on campus and 
affirming the organization’s 
dedication 
to 
continue 
to 

work for equality, safety, and 
freedom of Palestinians.

“The struggle is not over. 

Efforts 
to 
dialogue 
and 

build relationships with our 
classmates 
must, 
and 
will, 

continue,” the press release 
reads. “SAFE continues to work 

to uproot seeds of division, 
and affirm the humanity of all 
groups on campus. Injustice 
anywhere is a threat to justice 
everywhere. SAFE will never 
stop fighting for what is right.”

The 
SAFE 
member 

interviewed 
by 
The 
Daily 

described 
the 
group’s 
next 

steps, specifically highlighting 
the importance of conversation 
with 
those 
of 
opposing 

viewpoints to help create a 
campus of inclusion for all 
students.

“We recognize that right 

now there are people that 
aren’t necessarily happy that 
this resolution did pass and we 
really identify with that feeling 
and we understand how it 
feels,” they said. “Reaching out 
to all of the people that have 
been invested in this resolution, 
whether pro or against, and 
ensuring 
that 
people 
feel 

comfortable, 
ensuring 
that 

people understand that their 
identities are still welcome on 
this campus and creating more 
of a conversation around that 
dialogue.”

Roth, while in agreement of 

the importance of dialogue and 
conversation, 
explained 
her 

concern about the future effects 
of the anti-Semitic nature she 
and other students feel to be 
present within the resolution.

“I worry that because CSG 

leaders were unable to see 
the subtle yet crucial forms 
of antisemitism lying in this 
resolution and the broader BDS 
movement it represents, people 
will feel emboldened to let 
these types of subtle antisemitic 
comments run rampant,” she 
wrote. “We have so much work 
to do to address hate in all 

forms, and I hope we can work 
toward doing this in a way that 
does not cast any group aside.”

Aqel described her ideas for 

moving 
forward, 
suggesting 

a 
potential 
mirroring 
of 

other universities that have 
passed resolutions similar to 
Tuesday’s.

“A good idea is to see what 

other universities similar to the 
University of Michigan, what 
their groups that have passed 
resolutions in this nature, what 
they did following the passing 
of their resolution,” she said.

University 
administration 

has spoken on the resolution 
following 
its 
announced 

result. According to University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald, the 
University’s investments are 
undertaken so as to “generate 
the greatest possible income” 
to assist the University in 
its overall missions and to 
adhere to the desires of donors. 
Because 
of 
this, 
Fitzgerald 

explained, 
the 
University’s 

investment portfolio must be 
“diversified across a full range 
of legally recognized entities.”

“The 
University’s 

longstanding policy is to shield 
the endowment from political 
pressures and to base our 
investment 
decisions 
solely 

on financial factors such as 
risk and return,” his statement 
reads. “This approach has been 
underscored 
consistently 
by 

university leaders, including 
the Board of Regents, most 
recently in December 2015. We 
do not anticipate a change in 
this approach or the creation of 
a committee.”

In an interview with The 

Daily, E. Royster Harper, vice 
president 
for 
student 
life, 

also explained this concept, 
stating the decisions behind 
the University’s investments 
are 
primarily 
made 
on 

finance rather than any social 
movements.

When asked about concern for 

potential bias incidents against 
certain 
groups 
on 
campus 

following 
the 
resolution’s 

passing, Harper described the 
effort the administration has 
been making to ensure support 
is given to communities who 
may feel targeted.

“We have Jewish students 

that are worried about their 
safety; we have Muslim and 
Arab students that are worried 
about their safety,” she said. 
“So we have a pretty active 
Department of Public Safety 
right now trying to be attuned 
to and mindful of this, and this 
conversation in the context of a 
national conversation.”

Still, Tout explained, the 

initial reactions of students 
who worked in support of the 
resolution have continued to 
change — especially for those 
students 
whose 
relatives 

attended the University and 
worked for this same cause.

“In all of the work that we 

do around the resolution, we 
sort of forget that as much as it 
means to us it means infinitely 
more to Palestinian students,” 
Tout said. “It’s amazing that it’s 
generations of their families … 
who came and worked on the 
same resolution and the fact 
that it passed this year is just 
way more shocking to them, 
and 
amazing 
and 
restores 

their faith in Central Student 
Government and the student 
body even more than it does for 
us.”

RESPONSE
From Page 1A

We hope that 
anyone we’re 
choosing is 
doing things 
that are more 
pushing the 
barrier than 
things that 
are more 
typical

on the report Thursday night, 
dozens of residents expressed 
their frustration and lack of 
faith in the effort put into the 
review. Since June, residents 
and 
City 
Councilmembers 

have been dissatisfied with the 
quality and amount of outreach 
to marginalized communities 
in Hillard Heintze’s community 
survey of perceptions of police 
practices.

Resident 
Shirley 
Beckley 

pointed out the more-than-
20-year careers Debra Kirby 
and Kenneth Bouche –– the 
Hillard 
Heintze 
executives 

who managed the review –– 
had with the Chicago Police 
Department and the Illinois 
State Police.

“You all are ex-cops. We ask 

that they don’t have ex-cops, 
so they pay attention to the 
community. So I don’t expect 
you to give us, the community, 
any kind of credence,” Beckley 
said. “And I hope our City 
Council has some kind of heart 
about them, and not use all your 
brain power, but some of your 
heart, to know that we need this 
citizens’ oversight committee.”

AAPD Chief Jim Baird 

criticized the idea of a civilian 
oversight board when it was 
proposed in 2016, saying it 
should not be done without 
a third-party audit. Bouche 
said civilian oversight boards 
generally became tools for 

residents to air grievances 
in 
ways 
he 
said 
were 

unproductive.

“Civilian 
oversight 
does 

not solve community relations 
issues and it does not bring 
to resolution critical issues 
within the police department. 
It takes issues that are one, two, 
three, sometimes five years old, 
puts them in front of civilian 
review, and they’re generally 
old enough to where the police 
department really doesn’t even 
have that much accountability 
for them anymore,” he said. “It 
becomes a mechanism for 
people who are sometimes 
disenchanted 
with 
police 

departments to become more 
disenchanted, because all 
they see is the problem.”

Councilmember 
Jack 

Eaton, D-Ward 4, pointed 
out that if investigations into 
complaints are conducted 
internally by the AAPD, 
as they are now, civilians 
have less incentive to come 
forward with complaints and 
less reason to believe those 
complaints will be handled 
fairly.

“If 
someone 
wants 
a 

place to go other than the 
police department to lodge 
a complaint, and they want 
somebody to respond and 
say, ‘This is what we found to 
be true,’ it’s more particular 
than you’re talking about,” 
he said.

News of the ban would have 

been better received if the 
Interfraternity Council issued 
a direct statement to the public 
on what led it to take this 
action. The IFC’s statement 
to the press merely states its 
members were not living up to 
IFC’s standards. That’s putting 
it mildly if the lines crossed, 
in 
fact, 
endangered 
three 

students’ lives. The emails 
The Daily obtained reveal IFC 
officials encouraged members 
to vote for the suspension to 
stave off punishment from the 
University of Michigan and 
to give themselves the agency 
to lift the ban at a time that 
they deem fit. It is not lost on 
us that this self-suspension 
comes amid the incidents at 
Louisiana 
State 
University, 

Florida State University and 
Penn State University, where 
administrators all took action 
against 
fraternities 
in 
the 

wake of the deaths of students 
who were pledging. The IFC’s 
entire public face regarding 
this self-suspension calls us to 
question whether the council 
is truly dedicated to protecting 
the 
University 
community 

or if they are just protecting 
themselves.

Part of our concern for the 

IFC’s lack of transparency 
stems 
from 
the 
council’s 

failure to outline how they 
plan to confront the problems 
facing 
fraternity 
culture, 

especially 
since 
none 
of 

these 
allegations 
are 
new. 

The University’s 2015 sexual 
misconduct 
climate 
survey 

detailed a 2.5-times-greater 
risk 
of 
sexual 
misconduct 

among members of Greek life 
compared to those not in Greek 
life. Hazing resulted in the IFC 
revoking recognition of Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon in 2011, and 
since then, several fraternities 
have been kicked off campus 
for other incidents.

For those of us outside of 

Greek life, it is cumbersome 
to get meaningful information 
about what is being done to 
confront this culture, apart 
from the extreme step of the 
University itself terminating 
or suspending the “bad apples.” 
The IFC says it is working with 
campus 
resources 
like 
the 

Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center to change 
their culture on the issue of 
sexual misconduct. However, 
given recent allegations of 
bystander retaliation in the 

case of students who attended 
a Zeta Psi party, we are left 
to wonder what changes are 
actually being made.

Greek life is a significant 

part of this campus, making up 
much of the visible social life 
and providing a community 
for almost one-fifth of the 
undergraduate population. The 
allegations that led to this self-
suspension have the potential 
to demonize swaths of students 
who most likely had nothing to 
do with these serious charges. 
We implore the IFC and Greek 
life as a whole to be more 
open with other members of 
the 
University 
community 

about issues as they arise and 
how they plan to tackle them. 
By 
not 
being 
transparent 

about the allegations leading 
to this drastic action, the 
Interfraternity 
Council 
has 

opened the entirety of Greek 
life to rumor and speculation. 
And with little explanation 
so far as to tangible plans to 
address 
and 
prevent 
these 

issues going forward, we are 
hesitant to believe that IFC is 
serious about remedying these 
troubling problems within the 
community.

P

erhaps to your chagrin, 
this is another column 
regarding 
the 
Boycott, 

Divestment, Sanctions movement 
at the University of Michigan. In 
BDS’s iteration on campus, only 
the “D” — divestment — was 
up for proposal. Rather than 
formally opposing or supporting 
one side of the debate, I wish to 
contextualize both the origins and 
current situation the University 
community is grappling with: the 
vociferous and drawn-out Central 
Student Government debate and 
subsequent vote over whether 
the University’s Board of Regents 
should create a committee to 
investigate companies in Israel 
accused of human rights violations 
against Palestinians. Speeches from 
students and community leaders 
of all affiliations highlighted their 
personal narratives that shaped 
their outlook on the resolution. 

As we understood Tuesday 

evening, there are too many sides 
not just in the Arab-Israeli conflict, 
but also concerning BDS. What 
exactly are the stakes of what’s 
being argued? In the end, these 
concerns reveal the emotions 
people invest in this issue and the 
contention that ensues as a result. 
For all sides, it’s sometimes difficult 
to articulate this into words when 
instead actions may serve more 
apropos. In many transnational 
conflicts, land and nationhood 
are both symbols of pride used 
to formulate their own identities 
and 
differentiate 
themselves 

from others.

I recognize that by presenting 

“both sides” to this argument 
I am omitting the nuances and 
multiple perspectives groups and 
individuals bring when discussing 
this issue. My intention, therefore, 
is to highlight the central concerns 
and history of what exactly is being 
thrust into the limelight.

In the eyes of both BDS’s 

supporters and detractors, each 
side considers the other to be 
expunging history. This month 
was the centennial of the signing 
of the Balfour Declaration, which 
some historians view as ground 
zero of the “100 year war” between 
Jews and Arabs. Though the 
current situation in Israel, Gaza 
and the West Bank bears little 
in common with the genesis of 
this schism, both sides of the BDS 
debate on Tuesday night cited 
the need to reinvestigate the 
circumstances that enabled the 
present-day reality.

The timing of the divestment 

vote and the Balfour Declaration’s 
centennial could not be more 
fitting. In the midst of the 
centennial, 
academics 
are 

contemplating what the current 
status of the Arab-Israeli conflict 
means. 
Bernard 
Avishai 
and 

Rashid Khalidi published pieces 
in The New Yorker and Jacobin, 
respectively, 
addressing 
these 

concerns. 
Understanding 
the 

parallels between the present 
and past allows us to see the 
continuities in political debate.

Avishai, 
though 
more 

circumspect in his telling, stresses 
that from the outset the Balfour 
Declaration had an “equality of 
obligation,” in the words of the 
British Colonial Office, to both 
Arabs and Jews. While the Balfour 
Declaration became reified in 1917, 
Jewish immigration to Palestine 
had long been in place and would 
only increase in the years before 
the Israeli state was established in 
1948 (and thereafter).

Khalidi, on the other hand, is 

more deterministic in assigning the 
Balfour Declaration as the birth of 
the conflict. From his perspective, 
the 
“triple 
bind” 
of 
Zionist 

colonization, British imperialism 
and lack of international sympathy 
played into the shorthand of the 
stick Palestinians received.

From the outset, the United 

States has considered assistance 
to Israel in the national interest. 
President Harry Truman was 
one of the first international 
leaders to express support for 
the nascent Jewish state when 
it declared statehood in 1948. 
Since then, support has ebbed and 
flowed. Most Americans today 
hold Israel in high regard, but 
both generational and ideological 
differences are indicators of either 
support or disapproval.

BDS has thus become a linchpin 

of where one stands with Israel. 
From the movement’s official 
website, BDS is a global campaign 
and “Palestinian-led movement 
for freedom, justice and equality” 
that “upholds the simple principle 
that 
Palestinians 
are 
entitled 

to the same rights as the rest of 
humanity.” 
Divestment 
entails 

foregoing investments with any 
companies that deal directly with 
Israel. In this case, the movement 
targets 
Boeing, 
Lockheed 

Martin 
and 
Hewlett-Packard 

— all of which contribute to the 
University’s endowment.

While 
conservatives 
are 

contemptuous of college students 
for not supporting free speech 
ideals, 
Palestinian 
students 

(of whom Students for Allied 
Freedom and Equality — SAFE 
— spoke on behalf) contend that 
they have been continuously 
silenced for speaking out on 
what they believe is an injustice 
to 
themselves 
and 
their 

community. All such concerns 
stem from a fear of further 
marginalization at the hands 
of a student government that 
has rejected their proposal in 
successive fashion.

J

ean-Jacques Rousseau, the 
great 18th-century Genevan 
philosopher, wrote in The 

Social Contract the 
processes to establish 
a political institution. 
The bedrock idea put 
forth in his writing 
is that there are two 
parts to society: the 
sovereign 
and 
the 

government. 
The 

sovereign 
consists 

of the populace, and 
develops an infallible 
“general 
will,” 
the 

collectively held desire that strives 
for the common good of the society. 
Moreover, to form the sovereign, 
the people must devote themselves 
to each other through conversation 
and debate. Therefore, since it is 
an introspective assembly, the 
sovereign must find “some way to 
be assured of their fidelity.” This is 
the government’s role. In trusting 
the 
government 
to 
conduct 

applications of law, the social 
contract set by the sovereign can 
ensure their safety and protection.

Certainly some of that trust 

was broken when a shooter by 
the name of Devin Kelley shot 26 
people and wounded 20 others at 
a Texas church on Nov. 5. In 2012, 
Kelly escaped from a mental health 
facility. From 2010 to 2014, as a 
member of the U.S. Air Force, Kelly 
was imprisoned for domestic abuse 
against his wife and stepchild — 
which he would eventually be 
discharged for on bad conduct. He 
had also tried to carry out death 
threats against his superiors and 
snuck guns into his Air Force base 
in Holloman, Texas.

Yet, even after all his previous 

incidents, Kelley was still able to 
purchase multiple guns. Sadly, a 
number of laws and regulations 
were already in place in order to 
prevent this from happening. When 
Kelley escaped from the mental 
health facility he was never entered 
into the department’s missing or 
endangered person’s database, as 
was protocol. Moreover, the U.S. 
Air Force had two opportunities 
to stop Kelley from purchasing 
guns but they failed to enter him 
into national criminal databases 
used 
for 
background 
checks, 

which would have disqualified him 
from owning a gun. Subsequently, 
he 
went 
through 
multiple 

background 
checks 
and 
still 

received the weapons.

Rousseau 
wrote 
that 
if 

the 
government 
exceeds 
its 

boundaries, or is not abiding by the 
contract, the people have the right 
to demand a new government. 

However, 
what 

happens when political 
laws are set into place, 
assuring the safety of 
the citizens, and the 
laws do not work as 
intended?

Is 
this 
an 

individual 
or 
an 

institutional error? 
Is the “sovereign” an 
institution?

It shouldn’t be a 

surprise that most Americans want 
stricter gun control measures. 
According 
to 
Rousseau, 
this 

majority will of Americans is 
always correct. Therefore, when 
the U.S. Air Force made multiple 
errors in carrying out currently 
existing gun regulation law, they 
certainly did not carry out the 
general will of the sovereign. 
According to Rousseau, we have 
the right to demand reparations 
and a change, which in my view 
is a significant part of our own 
government today.

However, when reading about 

the many errors the U.S. Air Force 
made, I wondered how much of 
this is due to a few bad apples as 
opposed to a larger institutional 
problem. This is important to 
differentiate. If it were an error 
by a few individuals, that would 
mean that the institution shouldn’t 
need to change, but rather that the 
individuals who made these errors 
need to be removed. Moreover, 
I think that this issue yields the 
larger question of what should 
be considered “institutionalized” 
issues — for example, sexism in 
Hollywood or police brutality 
— and what should be the 
responsibility of select individuals 
involved in the specific incidents. 
In a time where the norms and 
institutions of our country are 
being tested and questioned, how 
do we deem an institution corrupt?

Firstly, we need to ask the 

question of whether the Air 
Force members prior to this 
shooting should be judged by their 
individuality or if they are a part 
of a larger problem. In considering 
the Air Force, if only a few people 
in its history have made errors such 
as these, it would make more sense 
to reprimand these few individuals 
rather than the institution as a 
whole. Nevertheless, in this case, 
I question whether you can clearly 
define when individual problems 

within the Air Force administration 
cross over and become institutional 
problems. And if you can, can we 
even calculate it? For example, 
how do we tangibly measure that 
50 percent of the people in an 
institution are deemed corrupt?

Secondly, 
how 
much 

complacency is considered to be the 
institutionalized issue? In the time 
of the late-nineteenth to the mid-
twentieth century, the Jim Crow 
laws were obvious institutional 
measures against a group of people. 
Today, we see this obvious measure 
again with the Rohingya Muslims 
and other groups for which there 
is an institutionalized effort to 
enforce discriminatory policies. 
But today’s issues are highly 
nuanced, and not entirely clear. 
There are clear measures to try and 
combat issues such as the shooting 
in Texas, but they fall through the 
cracks. Therefore, how much error 
on the part of the Air Force makes 
the Air Force a corrupt institution?

With 
these 
issues, 
I 
find 

that accountability is the most 
important part of making the 
contract work. Rousseau states 
that the contract, in terms of 
power, should form a “one-to-one” 
ratio between the government and 
the sovereign. I stand that the Air 
Force is not a corrupt institution, 
but rather there were many issues 
with some people within the 
organization. For this reason, I 
find that with Rousseau’s logic, 
that the institutions support and 
develop policy, but errors made 
within institutions policies are due 
to individual actions. Moreover, 
I 
deviate 
from 
Rousseau’s 

philosophy slightly, where I 
think the sovereign’s only use is 
for accountability.

As citizens, we must do our 

due diligence to ensure we 
understand as many of the 
policies outside the influence 
of social pressure and then 
come together to discuss our 
differences 
before 
creating 

the general will. It is also 
important to recognize that 
the general will only exists 
through compromise. Though 
it 
is 
difficult, 
given 
the 

complexity of our governmental 
policies, I assure you that 
holding 
individuals 
tasked 

with maintaining our contract 
accountable will ensure more 
safety in the future.

IFC, we want answers

I

n the wake of the Interfraternity Council’s suspension of all 
fraternity social activity due to serious allegations of sexual 
misconduct, hazing and dozens of hospitalizations due to 

alcohol-related incidents, it would seem plausible that students would 
have more concrete information than just rumors and whispers. 
Yet, in the days since the Interfraternity Council held this vote, 
we have yet to hear anything approaching a complete explanation 
as to what happened and what they plan to do in response and to 
prevent future incidents. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board finds 
this silence troubling and inexcusable. We understand the need 
for discretion to complete their ongoing investigation. However, 
we believe that behavior serious enough to warrant the extreme 
response of suspending social events, at the very least, deserves 
a public explanation. We call on the IFC to be more transparent, 
admit mistakes and readily disclose how they plan to reform.

Friday, November 17, 2017 — 5

At some point over the 

past few months, I tweeted 
something 
about 
being 

supremely 
uninterested 

in 
any 
feminist 
discourse 

surrounding Disney princesses 
until there was one with the 
personality of Jessica Jones. 
This 
was 
probably 
partly 

because I had fallen down a 
rabbit hole of reading angry 
blog 
posts 
about 
Disney 

princesses 
while 
reading 

about the social implications 
of every Halloween costume 
ever invented.

While 
I’m 
still 
waiting 

for 
that 
Jessica 
Jones-

esque 
princess 
(though 

not as impatiently as I am 
awaiting the sequel to “The 
Incredibles,”) 
I’ve 
changed 

my mind about the feminist 
discourse part, because I’ve 
finally been able to figure 
something out that has been 
puzzling me for a while.

Why I balk — and have 

always balked — when people 
assume I want kids is due 
to a number of reasons that 
don’t need to be aired on a 
public platform, and it’s such 
an exhausting, complicated 
conversation to have that I 
usually don’t. The number of 
times any attempt at a joke 
involving not wanting kids 
has resulted in: “Oh, you’ll 
change your mind,” “oh, but 
you have such good hips for 
kids” (that is the worst) or 
any number of increasingly 
rude or invasive comments is 
material for another article. 
Yet I realized that there might 
be 
a 
correlation 
between 

my knee-jerk reaction about 
assumptions 
of 
my 
future 

parental status and the Disney 
heroines I grew up relating to.

Sometimes it feels like the 

tendency to sort ourselves 
into random curations of pop 
culture references is universal; 
I remember sitting around 
doing it at sleepovers, way 
before we reached the golden 
age of Buzzfeed quizzes. When 
I was very young, one of the 
most popular sorting games 
was with Disney heroines. 
There were a couple that were 

close to my heart — like Ariel 
from “The Little Mermaid” 
and Wendy from “Peter Pan.”

I 
spent 
a 
couple 
years 

relating very strongly to Ariel 
and Wendy both; they both 
wanted something more than 
what they had, a different kind 
of magic in their lives. They 
both decided to take chances 
on the adventures of a lifetime, 
even when they were scared. I 
wanted to be just like them; in 
some ways, I thought I was, or 
could be.

But then I watched the 

sequels 
to 
both 
of 
those 

movies, 
and, 
 
not 
to 
be 

melodramatic, but my heart 
was torn. For a long time, I 
couldn’t decide if I loved or 
hated Jane and Melody, the 
daughters of Wendy and Ariel 
respectively. Unable to parse 
it out for myself, I chalked up 
my overreaction to the sequels 
as a kind of “they’re never as 
good as the original” snobbery.

But 
I’ve 
realized 
the 

problem I had for years with 
those sequels, was not that I 
had a love hate relationship to 
the heroines; it’s that I loved 
Jane and Melody and hated 
that I related to them. It felt 
like a kind of betrayal to their 
mothers. I resented the movies 
for making me align myself 
with Ariel and Wendy, and 
then just a few years later, still 
pre-pubescence, do the same 
with their daughters. That 
put me in the uneasy position 
of watching someone I had 
related to as a girl, become a 
mother, while I was still a girl 
myself — before I had had the 

chance (or the desire) to grow 
up.

I resented the fact that once 

Wendy and Ariel were both 
adults, they were basically 
barred from the magic and 
adventure they had had as 
kids and teenagers. I felt like 
I understood the frustration 
Wendy and Ariel felt with 
their 
parents 
(like 
every 

other angsty kid) — and then 
understood it, again, once that 
frustration was directed at 
them through their children. 
It was a bizarre feeling when 
I was a kid; it’s still bizarre 
now. What I internalized from 
all of that was: Growing up for 
girls meant becoming mothers, 
and becoming mothers meant 
losing out on the magic that I 
held dear to my heart.

And this isn’t something I 

ever saw in movies with boy 
protagonists, even when they 
grew up. Within the world of 
“Peter Pan,” even Peter gets 
to go back and have magic 
once an adult, in the critically 
acclaimed (by me, I’m the 
critic) 
“Hook.” 
This, 
too, 

seemed fundamentally unfair 
to me as a child.

Was I reading too much 

into the relatability politics 
of Disney movies and their 
sequels as a pre-teen? Yes. 
Am 
I 
still 
overthinking 

those 
implicit 
assumptions 

now? 
Probably. 
Thinking 

about the ending to “Return 
to Neverland,” when Peter 
can’t believe seeing the calm, 
grown-up Wendy in front of 
his eyes, still leaves me with 
a bittersweet ache that I don’t 
think I’ve been able to do 
justice to here (and the book 
is even more heartbreaking). 
Chances are I still need some 
time to think about what all 
of it means, before I can write 
about it with the eloquence I 
want.

(Until 
then, 
I’ll 
keep 

counting 
down 
the 
days 

until 
the 
sequel 
to 
“The 

Incredibles.” And woe betide 
any small child who thinks 
that I am too old to be sitting 
right next to them in that 
theatre).

‘reputation,’ and the many 
heads of Taylor Swift

Looking at Taylor Swift’s 

career, each of her previous 
five albums come with extreme 
calculation. 
Beginning 
as 

a teeny-bop country girl in 
2006, Swift took pre-measured 
strides away from country and 
into pop with each album. With 
ruler 
in 
hand, 

Swift 
accurately 

matured with her 
audience, 
slowly 

introducing 
only 

slightly suggestive 
lyrics 
into 
her 

music as her once 
young 
audience 

grew with her (see Red’s 
“Treacherous.”) Even while 
committing to pop music with 
1989, the “old Taylor” continued 
to 
embody 
girl-next-door 

innocence. With reputation, 
this old Taylor is dead, but 
the identity of this new Taylor 
is unclear. reputation excels 
in its instrumental cohesion, 
but Swift’s three seemingly 
disparate selfs — the new, 
the old and the real Taylor 
that ostensibly exists beneath 
them both — create a Hydra-
esque character that left me 
disoriented.

Reflecting on “old” Swift, 

it’s important to recognize 
that 
much 
of 
her 
media 

criticism comes from a place 
of sexism not uncommon in 
child 
stars’s 
careers. 
The 

difficulty that Miley Cyrus and 
Britney 
Spears 
experienced 

parallels that of Swift, both 
apotheosized as wholesome 
role models for young women 
and subsequently scrutinized 
for sexual expression. Like 
many before, Swift acted as 
an asexual representative for 
young listeners, referencing 
little more than a kiss. Even 
as Swift grew up, her image 
remained 
crystallized 
in 

purity, and when Swift did 
express 
herself, 
she 
was 

shamed. At nearly every award 
show, Swift’s dancing was 
ridiculed, not because it was 
necessarily poor form, but 
because the concept of Swift 
dancing 
suggestively 
was 

deemed laughable. Swift, a 
20-something woman, could 

not possibly be a sexual being.

On reputation, Swift sheds 

the good-girl image, asserting 
that she is an adult who can do 
adult things. “...Ready For It,” 
the album opener and second 
single, is a perfect concoction 
of sexually mature content 
and a self-awareness of her 
own deceptive nature. Swift 
describes “stealing hearts and 
running off and never saying 
sorry” and, for once, feels like 

she means it. “I 
Did Something 
Bad” reinforces 
this new Swift 
who 
owns 

her 
conniving 

nature. 
This 

Swift 
is 

believable, 

painting a picture of a woman 
in her 20s who owns her faults 
and knows her value. With 
heavy electronic synthesizers 
and 808s beats, her adult 
persona aligns well with the 
production; Swift wants you 
to picture her in the club — 
vengeful 
and 
sexy, 
finally 

enjoying her adult self.

However, at times a different, 

a more clichéd Swift shows 
her face, and the paparazzi 
shot of Swift in the club is less 
convincing. On “This Is Why 
We Can’t Have Nice Things,” 
Swift turns up the party girl 
image into a patchwork of 
sarcasm, drinking references 
and clickbait. The song is 
distastefully bitter, referencing 
the beaten horse of the Kanye 
feud in saying, “It was so nice 
being friends again / There 
I was giving you a second 
chance / But you stabbed me 
in the back while shaking my 
hand.” The track attempts the 
same melodramatic technique 
that made “Blank Space” so 
intriguing, 
but 
instead 
of 

self-criticism, Swift plays a 
character to draw pity. Her 
petty persona surfaces and 
the credibility of adult Swift 
wavers.

Even while Swift asserts 

herself 
as 
an 
adult, 
she 

continues to make sweeping 
generalizations that allude to 
the old Swift being very much 
alive. This Swift is familiar but 
feels uncomfortable over deep 
bass and autotune, begging 
the 
question 
of 
whether 

Swift really matured. “Call 

It What You Want” is full of 
classic Swift one-liners about 
how “she brought a knife to 
a gunfight” and “wants to 
wear his initial on a chain.” 
What made earlier Swift able 
to deliver such idyllic naivety 
was her innocent image — the 
concept that someone young 
and 
immature 
can 
believe 

in 
fairytale 
statements. 

Unfortunately, 
people 
grow 

up and realize that life (and 
especially 
relationships) 

can’t 
be 
reduced 
to 
such 

simplification.

The album closer, “New 

Year’s Day,” finally finds that 
third persona: The real Swift. 
She’s somewhere between old 
and new — singing over only a 
piano and guitar about picking 
up after a party. Listeners get a 
glimpse behind the reputation 
veil at an artist who is lonely 
and hurt, fearing that another 
lover will become a stranger. 
The song is a stark contrast to 
the rest of the album, devoid 
of any electronic sounds or 
percussion but, perhaps for 
that reason, feels the most 
revealing. 
This 
Swift 
still 

parties (“there’s glitter on the 
floor after the party”) and 
owns her sexuality (“you and 
me from the night before”), 
but delivers in a vulnerable 
manner that doesn’t align with 
the album’s aggressive and 
vindictive theme, leaving me 
wondering if even Swift is sure 
of her own identity.

Throughout 
reputation, 

there are points of extreme 
bitterness, some valid self-
awareness 
and 
even 
more 

laughable 
martyrdom, 
but 

one thing is consistent: Swift 
is scattered. For an artist so 
committed to brand cohesion 
historically, reputation feels 
like a battle among Swift’s 
many heads. Together with 
her 
three 
producers 
(Jack 

Antonoff, Max Martin and 
Shellback), Swift delivers an 
album that excels in conveying 
a 
sexualized, 
independent 

woman, but feels disjointed 
in its lyricism. reputation is a 
cacophonous experiment from 
an artist pulled so many ways: 
Fans who want her to stay 
the same, the media looking 
for 
controversy 
and 
Swift 

who wants, finally, to express 
herself as a 27-year-old.

Legends King Crimson to 
play Michigan Theater

“I don’t think King Crimson 

has ever been a band that’s 
influenced 
by 

the 
times, 
as 

in, I think it’s 
its own thing. I 
don’t think it’s 
trying to follow 
anybody 
else 

or trying to do 
something 
that 

fits 
in,” 
said 

Jeremy 
Stacey, 

one 
of 
King 

Crimson’s three 
drummers, in an interview 
with The Daily. “It’s its own 
beast, as it were.”

Jumping in early on the 

progressive rock movement 
of the ‘70s, King Crimson was 
formed in London in 1968. 
Currently 
an 
eight-piece 

lineup, 2017’s King Crimson 
includes 
founding 
member 

Robert 
Fripp 
(guitarist, 

composer 
and 

producer), 
Tony 

Levin 
(bass), 

Jakko 
Jakszyk 

(vocals, 
guitar), 

Mel Collins (flute, 
saxophone), 
Gavin 
Harrison 

(drummer, multi-
instrumentalist), 
Pat 
Mastelotto 

(drummer, multi-
instrumentalist), 

Bill Rieflin (drummer, multi-
instrumentalist) and Stacey.

In ‘69, they opened for The 

Rolling Stones in London. In 

the ‘80s, they toured under a 
different name (“Discipline”) 
after a brief disbanding. Now, 
King Crimson is coming to the 
Michigan Theater in the final 
leg of their North American 
Fall Tour.

King 
Crimson 
is, 
and 

always has been, a collection 
of 
incredibly 
impressive 

musicians: Fripp played guitar 
on David Bowie’s “Heroes,” (a 
tune which the group covered 
in Berlin in 2016). Bassist 
Tony Levin has played with 
the likes of Peter Gabriel and 
Paul Simon. Stacey, who joined 
the group in 2016, has worked 
with an unbelievable diversity 
of 
artists, 
including 
Noel 

Gallagher, Eurythmics and Joe 
Cocker.

Stacey noted, most likening his 
experiences with the band to 
working with jazz in his 20s.

“I was always doing lots of 

things with lots of different 
people. I think the thing about 
jazz is that you improvise,” he 
said. “To improvise, you have 
to understand how the form 
of the piece goes, otherwise 
you get lost. It was very good 

for listening, which I think is 
the most important thing [as a 
musician].”

Unconstrained in his work, 

Stacey 
is 
the 
epitome 
of 

King Crimson’s charm: A bit 
nostalgic, a bit novel and just 

restless enough to be fearless.

“For me, my whole life 

has 
been 
musical,” 
Stacey 

explained. “I always feel like 
I’m on a journey. I’m very 
interested in doing extremely 
different 
things, 
and 
the 

more 
extremely 
different, 

the better… I don’t want to be 
typecast in any way.”

A fan of the simpler tracks, 

Stacey’s favorite song to play 
live is “Starless,” from the 
group’s 1974 album Red.

“It’s one of my favorite 

pieces by King Crimson. I also 
get to play drums and keyboard 
[on it],” Stacey said. “There’s a 
freedom to playing whatever I 
feel on the night. I think (it’s) 
my favorite moment of the gig, 
normally.”

This 
autonomy 
Stacey 

mentions is laced throughout 
King Crimson’s work: Each 
piece 
is 
malleable 
to 
the 

group’s interpretation.

“I feel that I’m involved in 

it more than I’ve been in other 
projects,” Stacey said. “It’s not 
like doing a job. There is input, 
and it’s a very in the moment 
form of input on stage … I can’t 
compare it to anything.”

The 
experiecne 
often 

transcends description.

“It’s very difficult to explain 

what it’s like being in the 
band — it’s very difficult. All 
the other things I’ve done all 
follow a path that’s similar to 
other paths that are followed 
by other artists — it’s standard. 
There’s nothing about this 
that’s standard in any way. 
There’s nothing about it that’s 
straightforward or normal. It 
just isn’t,” Stacey said. “It feels 

like a very good thing to be 
doing.”

King Crimson is set to 

play this Wednesday at the 
Michigan Theater.

‘Killer’ salvages its story 
with excellent production

“The Killer” is the latest 

release from Brazilian writer 
and 
director 

Marcelo 
Galvão 

(“Farewell”). 
This gunslinging 
western 
isn’t 

set in the Wild 
West, but instead 
during the 1940s 
in the desert badlands of 
Brazil, telling the story of the 
feared manhunter Cabaleira 
(Diogo 
Morgado, 
“Son 
of 

God”). 
Following 
a 
wide 

release in Brazil during April 
of 2016, the film comes to 
Netflix with English subtitles 
as 
the 
streaming 
service 

begins to expand its catalogue 
of international films. The 
film is a far-cry from a sleek, 
overproduced western, and it 
certainly doesn’t romanticize 
its subject matter. Despite 
its harsh, visceral and gritty 
aesthetic, 
the 
film 
avoids 

monotony 
with 
excellent 

production, performances and 
more than a few tricks up its 
sleeve.

One of the most immediately 

recognizable strengths of the 
film is its cinematography. 

Containing more than its fair 
share of engaging, artful shots, 
Galvão’s visual direction offers 
a fresh lens for the Western 
genre, making creative use 
of birdseye shots that travel 
over 
doorways 
and 
follow 

characters 
between 
rooms. 
The 

cinematography 
also 
changes 

stylistically 
throughout 
the 

film to fit the tone 

of specific scenes. For example, 
as 
the 
narrator 
describes 

the 
delightfully 
despicable 

owner of a small desert town, 
Monsieur 
Blanchard, 
the 

audience is shown a series of 
Wes Anderson-esque frontal 
shots of ornate “M.B.” placards 
on local buildings. During 
a climactic scene that sees 
the main character injured, 
however, 
Galvão 
instead 

uses fast paced, abstract cut-
aways that are reminiscent 
of Alejandro Iñárritu’s “The 
Revenant.” The film’s array of 
cinematographic styles flow 
together wonderfully, never 
feeling jarring because they 
closely follow the tone of the 
film.

Voiceover narration is often 

criticized in film as a crutch 
for directors who assume their 

audience is stupid. In “The 
Killer,” 
however, 
narration 

is skillfully used as a means 
to help convey the legendary, 
larger than life weight of 
the 
characters 
and 
events 

in the film. As the narrator 
tells Cabaleira’s story over a 
campfire, one can’t help but 
be drawn in. If this weren’t 
enough, the cast offers solid 
performances that couple with 
strong writing to create vivid, 
memorable 
characters. 
The 

villainous Blanchard family 
in particular are the types of 
villains that are unbelievably 
fun to hate. The film is 
certainly not one you’d expect 
to have a musical number, 
but it happens nevertheless 
as the despicable Monsieur 
and Madame Blanchard sing 
in a cabaret show about their 
desire to burn their enemies 
homes to the ground and have 
sex on the ground in front of 
the inferno. Yep.

Perhaps the one place the 

film falters is its story, which 
is at some times predictable 
and at others hard to follow. 
The story takes several twists 
and turns, following several 
tangentially related characters’ 
storylines, 
occasionally 

leaving audiences wondering 
“Who 
are 
these 
people?” 

While everything is eventually

“The Killer”

Netflix

Now streaming on 

Netflix

explained, 
it’s 
sometimes 

not without a solid 20 to 30 
minutes of head scratching 
over what the relevance of 
these scenes are to the overall 
plot. Other elements of the film 
were just plain predictable; 
more than one or two would-be 
big reveals are squandered by 
being visible from a mile away. 
These hiccups could be due 
to fault subtitle translation, 
but regardless the result is 

the same: The portrayal an 
overarching story seems to 
hinder the film more than it 
helps.

While 
the 
storytelling 

may stumble once or twice, 
“The 
Killer” 
remains 
an 

entertaining 
experience. 

Excellent 
cinematography 

blends a multitude of visual 
styles in a way that feels 
unique without feeling out 
of place, and solid character 

writing and performances fill 
the Brazilian badlands with 
an array of vibrant characters. 
The story, flawed though it may 
be, almost feels secondary to a 
film that’s more of a stylized 
portrait of a time period and 
a place. It has a central story, 
but overall the film seems 
better suited as an invitation 
for audiences to be immersed 
in the rough, wild and gritty 
world that it portrays.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
SMTD’s student showcase 
to debut new compositions

At the end of a performance, 

an 
audience’s 
applause 
is 

usually 
directed 
toward 

the 
performers 
on 
stage. 

Often times audiences aren’t 
thinking, 
however, 
of 
the 

individuals 
behind 
the 

scenes: 
the 

composers. 
The 
Student 

Composers’ 
Concert 
at 

the 
School 

of 
Music, 

Theatre 
& 

Dance 
aims 

to 
do 
the 

opposite, 
by 
showing 

off 
new 

works 
from 

different student composers at 
the University.

This will be the second of five 

different composer showcases 
put on by the Composition 
Department this school year. 
Each concert features new 
works from various students in 
the Composition Department, 
each one different from the 
last. Douglas Hertz, a second-
year Master’s student in SMTD 
said that “every single concert 
is a whole new experience.”

With 
an 
abundance 
of 

concerts at the music school, 
there’s usually some sort of 
central theme or consistent 
type of instrumentation. These 
recitals, however, differ from 
these as they contain pieces 

of varying themes and with 
a wide variety of different 
instrumentations.

“Everyone is exploring new 

styles all the time,” Hertz said 
in an interview with The Daily. 
“It’s kind of hard to stylistically 
pigeonhole any of the concerts, 
or any of the composers for 
that matter.” Most of the time, 
composers use these concerts 

to show off 
new 
works 

they’ve been 
writing.

SMTD 

is 
known 

throughout 
the 
world 

for 
its 

distinguished 
composition 
program. 
Graduates of 
the program 
have 
had 

works 

played 
by 
countless 
major 

symphony 
orchestras 
and 

have won awards from major 
organizations, 
including 

several Grammys. However, 
even with all of this legacy, 
the department is constantly 
exploring different ways to 
create new music.

The relationship between 

composer and performer is 
especially strong at the School 
of Music. With many strong 
departments 
of 
performers 

at their disposal, composers 
often take advantage of the 
notoriously talented players at 
the School of Music — and the 
relationship is mutual.

“People 
seem 
to 
really 

respect 
and 
appreciate 

composers and new music in 
a way that feels really genuine 
and inspiring,” Hertz said. 
“And I think that’s part of the 
lifeblood of being a composer 
here, is that you have such 
collaborative enterprises with 
instrumentalists, in a way 
that might not exist at other 
schools.”

Seeing 
this 
collaboration 

is a really unique experience, 
and it’s something that often 
leads to some truly magical 
moments. The school is proud 
to be a promoter of fresh music, 
and 
these 
collaborations 

between 
composer 
and 

performer 
are 
no 
better 

example of that. The School of 
Music, among other things, is 
known for its promotion of new 
music, and the Composition 
Department is at the forefront 
of this movement. Hertz said 
that performers are “hungry 
for 
new 
music,” 
and 
the 

Composition Department is 
happy to deliver.

The program consists of 

a diverse group of pieces, 
written over an expansive 
period of time.

“We 
don’t 
limit 
when 

the piece has to have been 
composed,” 
Hertz 
said. 

“However, 
they 
have 
to 

be shared with their [the 
composer’s] studio teacher… so 
sometimes people will put on 
a piece from a few years back; 
pieces that they might have 
revised and are premiering 
a new interaction — it’s very 
open.”

For 
composers, 
hearing 

their work realized can be 
an 
even 
more 
incredible 

experience. Hearing a digital 
recording 
of 
their 
piece 

performed by electronic, or 
MIDI, instruments can only do 
so much.

“MIDI only goes so far,” 

Hertz said. “It takes live 
performers to really take a 
piece to that next level.”

The 
Student 
Composers’ 

Concert is an opportunity to 
see new music be realized. It’s 
a transformative experience 
for composers and audiences 
alike. 
Hearing 
performers 

put expression into different 
composers’ work is an amazing 
experience.

Behind Enemy Lines:
Wisconsin’s Fumagalli

Jake Butt was the Big Ten’s 

tight end to watch last year. 

Michigan 
will 
face 
his 

successor this weekend in 
Troy Fumagalli.

Fumagalli, a senior for No. 

5 Wisconsin, finished second 
in the conference in receiving 
yards last year. He’s in first 
place through 10 games this 
season, 
having 
tallied 
33 

catches for 422 yards and 
three touchdowns.

He possesses all the pass-

catching 
prowess 
of 
Penn 

State’s Mike Gesicki (or Butt) 
— and is also quite the capable 
blocker. The Wolverines’ tight 
ends are certainly cognizant of 
Fumagalli’s skillset.

“Yeah, I watched (his) film 

against Maryland when we 
were studying for them,” said 
sophomore 
Sean 
McKeon. 

“He’s a great tight end, great 
technique and pass catcher 
for Wisconsin. So I think he’s 
going to probably get drafted 
this year and go pretty high, so 
I think he’s a great player.”

Perhaps the most impressive 

thing about Fumagalli is that 
he has done all this with just 
nine fingers, losing one the day 
after he was born from a birth 
defect.

The 
Daily 
spoke 
with 

Fumagalli at Big Ten Media 
Days in July about Wisconsin’s 
passing game, his impression 
of the Wolverines and whether 
he thinks Wisconsin coach 
Paul Chryst — who coached the 
tight ends when Jim Harbaugh 
quarterbacked the San Diego 
Chargers 
— 
shares 
any 

similarities with Michigan’s 
head coach.

Q: How did you injure your 

finger?

TF: When I was born, no 

circulation got to it, so they had 
to cut it off. It’s called amniotic 
band syndrome. Two days old.

Q: Does it hinder you in any 

way, shape and form?

TF: Nope. Nothing I can 

think of, honestly.

TMD: You and Jazz (Peavy) 

finished 14th and 15th in the 
conference in receiving yards 
last year. With both of you 
coming, how big of a base does 
that give your passing game to 
work off of?

TF: It’s big. We’re both 

seniors now. I think we’ve 
got to set that standard and 
move that forward. I think we 
both — I can speak for Jazz 
too — we do expect to bring 
that forward and be a more 
pivotal part. But it is big, just 
knowing that we can turn on 
the film from last year, Alex 
(Hornibrook) and us two, and 
even A.J. (Taylor) and Quintez 
(Cephus), who played quite a 
bit, and just know that we can 

look at our own film and learn 
from that and see where we 
need to grow.

TMD: 
How 
does 
that 

change the pass coverages you 
guys see, with how often you 
run the ball?

TF: The biggest thing that 

I notice is we always got a lot 
of safeties downhill, a lot of 
guys in the box. It gives a lot 
of one-on-one matchups most 
times, which is good, and the 
more we can run, the more 
play-action works, and we can 
bounce those two off of each 
other.

Q: What do you know about 

Michigan off the top of your 
head?

TF: Not a whole lot. I 

know that they’re losing a 
ton of guys. But I do expect 
Michigan to have guys ready. I 
think they have a ton of talent, 
obviously. They’re going to be 
very competitive.

Q: What’s the first thing you 

think of when you hear the 
word ‘Michigan’?

TF: I guess kind of that 

football, 
I 
don’t 
know, 

sanctuary that they got going. 
They got the Big House and all 
that. And a ton of people you 
see around, huge Michigan 
football fans, and I’ve got a lot 
of respect for that and what 
they’ve done.

Q: Everyone talks about how 

well Ohio State and Michigan 
recruit. 
Are 
they 
off-the-

charts talented, or are they 
just another Big Ten team?

TF: I think any team can 

beat any team, and any team 
can lose to any team in the Big 
Ten. But yeah, I think those 
guys are very competitive. 
I got a chance to go against 
Hooker 
last 
year, 
(former 

Buckeyes’ 
safety) 
Malik 

Hooker, I thought he was one 
of the better, if not one of the 
best, safeties I’ve played all 
year. I thought he was very 
good instinctually and the way 
he hit, it was good.

Q: Going back to Michigan, 

do you see any similarities 
between you and them with 
the pro-style offense and kind 
of defense they play?

TF: Yeah. Similar to a lot of 

the Big Ten schools, you can 
match the physicality they 
have. The effort they play with 
is also there, I would say.

Q: 
Do 
you 
see 
any 

similarities 
with 
Coach 

Harbaugh and Coach Chryst?

TF: Uh, I don’t know enough 

about Coach Harbaugh. But I 
know they used to be friends 
back in the day. Forgot what I 
heard. Something about how 
they used to do some football 
thing together. But I’m sure 
that they think they are similar. 
You know, they’re obviously 
pro-style guys and stuff like 
that.

What to Watch For: No. 5 Wisconsin 

The Michigan football team is 

heading into a hostile environment 
this weekend. ESPN’s “College 
GameDay” will be on the scene 
when the 19th-ranked Wolverines 
get there, and they will be facing a 
top-five opponent. 

Sound familiar?
This 
time, 
that 
hostile 

environment is Madison, where 
the fifth-ranked Badgers await.

And the outcome of Michigan’s 

next two contests could very well 
determine the entire perception 
of its season, as it searches for its 
first road win against a ranked 
opponent since 2006.

The Wolverines got a tune 

up against the likes of Rutgers, 
Minnesota 
and 
Maryland. 

Wisconsin, on the other hand, is the 
only team left in the Big Ten with 
an undefeated record, vying for a 
spot in the College Football Playoff.

One 
loss 
could 
all 
but 

extinguish those hopes for the 
Badgers. Here’s what to watch for 
this Saturday as Michigan looks to 
derail Wisconsin’s playoff hopes 
Saturday.

Peters’ party?
There are a lot of things 

we’ve learned about Brandon 
Peters through the past three 
games. The redshirt freshman is 
unquestionably Michigan’s starter. 
He can manage a game well. And he 
has said that he can do anything the 
coaches ask of him in this offense.

The time has come to find out 

just how true that is.

Michigan’s 
run 
game 
has 

excelled 
in 
each 
of 
Peters’ 

meaningful 
games, 
averaging 

288.3 yards through the last three 
contests with 10 touchdowns. 
Against Wisconsin, though, the 
Wolverines may find their first 
legitimate opposition to that run 
game.

The fifth-ranked Badgers boast 

the best rushing defense in the 
nation, allowing just 81.5 yards 
per game on the ground. For all 
the success Karan Higdon and 
company have had, Saturday could 

be the first time Peters is asked 
to legitimately win a game for 
Michigan.

“They are a very good defense,” 

said offensive coordinator Tim 
Drevno. “They’ve got a very solid 
front — they’re an odd front. 
They like to try to knock you 
back, the (linebackers) do a good 
job of flowing, the secondary is 
outstanding. If you’re looking for 
depth, I think they’re all juniors 
and seniors.”

It’s undoubtedly encouraging 

that Peters has yet to turn the ball 
over since taking over under center 
against Rutgers. But if Wisconsin 
does shut down the ground attack, 
taking care of the ball won’t be 
enough to escape Madison with an 
upset. 

Starting slow
To state the obvious, Michigan’s 

offense hasn’t been able to start 
games with a bang.

Since facing Cincinnati on Sept. 

9, the Wolverines have scored 
more than seven points in the first 
quarter only once.

With 
the 
exception 
of 
a 

matchup against then-No. 2 Penn 
State — during which the Nittany 
Lions scored 14 points in the first 
quarter — the Wolverines’ defense 
has managed to negate Michigan’s 
offensive flaw. And really, that’s 
been the story of the season.

But another test is on the 

horizon, one that this defensive 
unit may not be able to limit so 
easily. In running back Jonathan 
Taylor, the Badgers have the 
conference leader in rushing yards 
(1,525) and touchdowns (12).

The longer Michigan waits to 

counteract that offensive threat, 
the more likely it could hurt. If there 
were a time for the Wolverines to 
come out firing, this Saturday is it.

A one, a two, a 3-4
On Monday, fifth-year senior 

center 
Patrick 
Kugler 
didn’t 

shy away from admitting that 
Wisconsin’s unconventional 3-4 
defensive front will be a challenge 
for Michigan’s resurgent offensive 
line.

Drevno echoed that sentiment 

Wednesday, elaborating on the 

challenges the scheme may present.

“It’s a little bit different, and 

they play a traditional 3-4 where 
they’re a yard off the ball with 
those defensive linemen,” he said. 
“They’re trying to knock you back 
and free up the (linebackers). 
They’re trying to take away some 
different things on that front. So 
it’s unique.

“Most people that play that 

front want to move the front, so 
they start to slant themselves out 
of it and bring zone pressure trying 
to defeat your passing game and 
different things. But they’re trying 
to win it on the back end with the 
secondary and try to create some 
pass rushing, different things, 
gonna get to third down and bring 
some exotic looks.”

While the Wolverines’ offensive 

line has experienced a midseason 
renaissance of sorts, it is facing its 
biggest test of all Saturday — much 
like the quarterback it will be 
protecting.

The last straw
There was a time earlier this 

season when a small contingent of 
Michigan faithful took to Twitter, 

advocating for Quinn Nordin to be 
this year’s Heisman winner.

For the redshirt freshman 

kicker, that must feel like a long 
time ago.

With his miss from 31 yards 

against Maryland, Nordin has now 
failed to convert on a field goal 
attempt since Oct. 14 — missing 
two extra points in that same span.

The botched attempt against 

Maryland yielded an animated 
discussion between Nordin and 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
on the sideline. And Harbaugh’s 
message was simple: start making 
them.

“He didn’t really snap back,” 

Harbaugh said. “I said to (Nordin), 
‘I’m giving you one more shot. 
You’ve got to make the next one.’ 
And he said, ‘I got this. I will make 
the next one.’ ”

Nothing had changed in that 

regard by Monday, as Harbaugh 
reiterated his message to Nordin, 
albeit with more a more interesting 
expression.

“Strap on the iron jock,” he said, 

“and kick the ball through the 
uprights.”

Breakdown: No. 24 Michigan vs Wisconsin

For the first time since its 

blowout loss to then-No. 2 Penn 
State, the Michigan football 
team is back in the College 
Football Playoff rankings.

On the heels of a three-game 

winning streak, the Wolverines 
have checked in as the 24th-best 
team in the country in the eyes 
of the College Football Playoff 
Committee. While the opponents 
Michigan has faced between 
then and now are relatively small 
fish, the Wolverines will attempt 
to fry a big one this weekend.

Saturday, Michigan (5-2 Big 

Ten, 8-2 overall) will travel 
to Madison to take on No. 5 
Wisconsin (7-0, 10-0), eager to 
redeem its record against top 
competition.

Here’s how the Wolverines 

match up with the Badgers on 
Saturday.

Michigan pass offense vs 

Wisconsin pass defense

Redshirt 
freshman 

quarterback 
Brandon 
Peters 

may have received his first taste 
of game action on the road last 
Saturday at Maryland, but he 
will have the biggest test of his 
young career in Madison.

Michigan has faced plenty 

of stingy defenses this year, 
but none can hold a candle to 
Wisconsin. The Badgers have 
the top-ranked defense in the 
country, and they also rank first 
in both team passing efficiency 
defense and rushing defense.

Wisconsin allows an average 

of just 247.6 yards per game and 
has notched 15 interceptions 
while 
allowing 
merely 
11 

touchdowns. The Badgers are 
the only team in the nation 
holding opponents to a passer 
rating below 95, as they have 
given 
up 
just 
eight 
scores 

through the air.

If Wisconsin’s defense posts 

even an average performance, 
Peters could be in for a long day.

Edge: Wisconsin
Michigan run offense vs 

Wisconsin run defense

The Wolverines’ ground game 

has been on a good run of late, 

but it will be at less than full 
strength at an inopportune time.

Junior Karan Higdon and 

fifth-year senior Ty Isaac are 
both 
dealing 
with 
injuries, 

though the severity of each 
has been kept relatively under 
wraps. Higdon left the game 
against Maryland and did not 
return, while Isaac has missed 
Michigan’s past two contests.

Whether or not they end up 

suiting up against the Badgers, 
the load will be left to sophomore 
Chris Evans. Though Evans has 
come into his stride in recent 
weeks, 
Wisconsin’s 
rushing 

defense is even better than its 
passing 
defense. 
Opponents 

average a measly 81.5 yards 
rushing and have scored just 
three touchdowns against the 
Badgers this season.

The Wolverines’ resurgent 

ground game may come to a 
screeching halt Saturday.

Edge: Wisconsin

Michigan pass defense

If there is one area of the game 

in which Michigan can gain the 
upper hand, it will be up to its 
secondary to make it happen.

The Wolverines aren’t far 

behind 
Wisconsin 
in 
team 

passing 
efficiency 
defense, 

ranking third in the nation while 
allowing one less touchdown 
than their counterpart through 
the air this year. Michigan is 
second in passing yards allowed, 
as opponents have gained an 
average of just 144.5 yards.

Badger 
quarterback 
Alex 

Hornibrook has thrown for 17 
total touchdowns in addition 
to an average of 186.3 yards per 
game, but he leads an offense 
that places more of an emphasis 
on the running game.

The Wolverines will have a 

chance to take advantage of this 
matchup, and they can’t afford 
to waste it.

back 

Saquon Barkley deserves all 
the plaudits he receives, but 
Wisconsin’s Jonathan Taylor 
isn’t far behind as one of the best 
backs in the Big Ten.

Considering how Barkley ran 

all over Michigan to the tune of 
108 yards and two touchdowns, 
that isn’t a good sign for the 
Wolverines.

The Badgers are a ground-

and-pound team, and Taylor 
leads the charge. He averages 
152.5 rushing yards per game 
and has scored 12 touchdowns 
on his own. Michigan has a 
strong defense, allowing an 
average of just 110.3 rushing 
yards, but it might not be enough 
to stop Taylor.

In a battle of two highly-

ranked defenses, the Wolverines’ 
unit doesn’t quite measure up.

Edge: Wisconsin
Special teams
This phase of the game will be 

a decided by a contest of kickers.

Redshirt 
freshman 
Quinn 

Nordin has endured a rough 
stretch of late, missing three 
consecutive field goals and two 
extra points as well to drop his 
season record to 14-for-19.

Wisconsin 
kicker 
Rafael 

Gaglianone may have been tested 
less often, but he maintains 
markedly better, making 10 of 
his 12 field goals, good for an 
80-percent completion rate.

Earlier this season, it would 

have been hard to bet against 
Michigan’s 
special 
teams 

unit, but with Nordin’s recent 
struggles, that is no longer the 
case.

Edge: Wisconsin
Intangibles
The Wolverines have a lot on 

the line in this game, as they 
would drop out of the Big Ten 
championship picture with a 
loss.

But the Badgers have a lot more 

at stake. An undefeated season 
and a spot in the College Football 
Playoff hang in the balance. 
Camp Randall Stadium, one of 
the most energetic environments 
in college football, will likely be 
an even more hostile atmosphere 
for Michigan than that of Beaver 
Stadium last month.

While the Wolverines will 

seek to play the spoiler, the odds 
are stacked against them.

Edge: Wisconsin
Prediction: Michigan 24, 

Wisconsin 31

Wolverines look to stay on a roll

Senior 
forward 
Tony 

Calderone fired a shot last Friday 
night that found the back of the 
net and fans leaped out of their 
seats in a deafening uproar 
of cheers and applause. The 
Wolverines would go on to notch 
their first win against a top-10 
team in the nation.

They won’t hear those cheers 

this weekend.

The No. 17 Michigan hockey 

team 
(2-1-1 
Big 
Ten, 
6-3-1 

overall) travels to Madison this 
weekend to face off against 
No. 9 Wisconsin (2-2, 7-5-1) for 
the Wolverines’ second top-10 
matchup in two weeks.

On an Olympic-sized rink 

that Mel Pearson described as 
feeling like playing on an ocean 
compared to an inland lake, the 
Michigan coach noted that the 
hostile environment will require 

a heightened level of play.

“We have to play better 

defensively,” Pearson said. “That 
can be from your goaltender to 
your penalty killing to just puck 
management, we have to really 
be sharp and really know where 
we’re putting pucks.”

While the Wolverines are 

coming 
off 
an 
impressive 

weekend 
against 
No. 
7 

Minnesota, the Badgers boast yet 
another high-powered offense 
that will give Michigan reason to 
be wary.

With six goals and five assists 

under his belt, Wisconsin forward 
Ryan Wagner should be the 
biggest threat to break through 
the Wolverines’ defensive line.

“We’ve got to make sure we get 

to the net,” Pearson said. “And 
on the other end defensively, 
we’ve got to make sure we play 
between the dots and not extend 
ourselves out to the boards when 
we have to protect the middle of 

the ice.”

Pearson has made it clear in 

the past that he wants his team to 
improve defensively, but it would 
be hard to apply that same logic 
to the offense.

Spearheaded 
by 
Calderone 

and sophomore forward Jake 
Slaker – who both have seven 
and six goals, respectively – the 
Michigan offense ranks highest 
in the conference in goals scored 
per game with 3.90.

Conversely, the Wolverines 

are also tied for the second-
lowest 
total 
goals 
allowed 

defensively.

To say that the matchup this 

weekend will be contentious 
is 
a 
severe 
understatement. 

Wisconsin is coming off a loss 
to Michigan State and is looking 
to avenge the defeat, but the 
question is whether the Badgers 
will be able to stop the inertia 
of a Wolverine squad fresh off a 
momentous weekend.

Three-point shooting 
woes continue for ‘M’ 

The 3-point line is 20.75 feet 

away from the rim in college 
basketball.

In 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team’s past two games, 
its 3-point shooting has seemed 
like the distance is closer to 50 
feet.

After a lackluster 10-for-34 

showing from beyond the arc 
against Central Michigan on 
Monday, the Wolverines (3-0) 
followed it up on Thursday with 
another 
pedestrian 
8-of-23 

performance in a 61-47 win over 
Southern Mississippi. Michigan 
was just 4-for-18 before the 
Golden Eagles (1-1) ran out of gas 
and relaxed their man-to-man 
defense.

“Games like this, we need to 

really understand and work at 
what make offenses click,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“It’s not clicking right now 
because the ball is sticky. We’ve 
gotta move the ball and just 
trust what it does. (Southern 
Mississippi coach) Doc Sadler 
plays really good defense — his 
teams no matter where they’ve 
been. A bad defensive team 
wouldn’t have exposed that.”

Lights-out long-range shooting 

is typically a mainstay of Beilein’s 
offense. During the Wolverines’ 
weak 
non-conference 
slate, 

however, it evidently hasn’t been 
a significant factor for the win 
column. But the disappointing 
results forecast doubt upon a team 
that will potentially play two AP 
top-25 teams next week in the 
Maui Invitational. Then, they will 
no longer be able to skate by with 
such poor shooting. 

“I don’t know if we’ve got 

the Hardaway-, Stauskas-type 
volume and success out there 
that we’ve had before, but I don’t 
think we’re a bad shooting team,” 
Beilein said. “… I don’t think we’re 

taking bad ones. We’re trying to 
hunt them sometimes when they 
don’t need to get hunted.”

On Thursday night, fifth-year 

senior Duncan Robinson was the 
first to take a three against the 
Golden Eagles. Clink.

Up only a bucket, junior 

forward Moritz Wagner launched 
one with 26 seconds remaining 
the first half. Clink.

Tied at 36 early in the second 

half with a lifeless Crisler Center 
crowd, senior guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman had two 
open, long-range opportunities to 
change the tide. Clink and Clink.

Amidst a handful of other 

untimely misses, Michigan finally 
managed to flip the switch after 
Robinson drained a three at the 
11:37 mark to give the Wolverines 
a 41-40 lead, one it would never 
relinquish. At that point, though, 
the game could only be considered 
a sight for sore eyes despite a 
breakthrough performance by 
sophomore center Jon Teske.

“It might be an early season 

thing, or just a day thing,” Abdur-
Rahkman said. “We got a lot 
of open shots, we just weren’t 
knocking them down. I think we 
started knocking them down a 
little bit in the second half. But we 
gotta shoot better, and if we don’t 
shoot better, we gotta play better 
defensively.”

On the defensive end, Southern 

Mississippi shot a conservative 
6-for-13 from behind the line, 
including an off-balance 3-pointer 
by point guard Tyree Griffin 
that put the Golden Eagles up 
by one at the half. Against better 
competition, 
this 
shooting 

discrepancy simply won’t cut it.

When 
Michigan 
travels 

to Maui, nearly 4,400 miles 
away from Ann Arbor, it may 
be a refreshing escape for an 
inconsistent Michigan team.

As for the 3-point line? The 

Wolverines would like it to seem 
much, much closer to home.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan utilizes big second-half 
run to beat Southern Mississippi 

In its first two games, it seldom 

looked easy for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team. 

Both 
North 
Florida 
and 

Central Michigan challenged the 
Wolverines with zone defenses 
rarely utilized at the college 
level.

But against a mostly man-

to-man 
defense 
— 
facing 

Michigan’s weakest opponent 
to date statistically in Southern 
Mississippi — it seemed like 
the night the Wolverines would 
finally roll.

It wasn’t — at least until late in 

the game.

After trailing at the half, the 

Wolverines (3-0) used a 21-1 
run during the second half to 
dispatch 
the 
Golden 
Eagles 

(1-1), 61-47, at Crisler Center on 
Thursday night.

That run started with the 

fingertips 
of 
junior 
forward 

Moritz Wagner, who hit a free-
throw line jumper to bring 
Michigan within two points. 
Then, fifth-year senior forward 
Duncan Robinson hit an open 
corner three — as he did two 
possessions later to extend the 
Wolverines’ advantage to seven.

Moments 
later, 
sophomore 

forward Jon Teske — who 
again showed that he’s a much-
improved player this year with 10 
points and 11 rebounds Thursday 
— added a pair of jumpers and 
Robinson hit another three.

Robinson 
and 
Abdur-

Rahkman 
led 
Michigan 
in 

scoring with 12 and 14 points, 
respectively.

Defensively, Michigan forced 

Southern Mississippi to miss 
nine straight shots and concede 
four turnovers in what was the 
Wolverines’ best stretch of their 
young season on both ends of the 
floor. 

“We just played and trusted 

what we were doing,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“A whole lot of good things were 
happening there.” 

Added Teske: “We knew our 

shots would fall in the second 
half. So, defensively, in the 
second half, we really just got 
down and guarded.” 

The Wolverines were nearly as 

solid to start the contest, too.

Unlike 
the 
two 
previous 

games, Michigan was dominant 
to start the game and rode the 
scoring 
abilities 
of 
Wagner 

and senior guard Muhammed-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman out to a 
14-point lead midway through 
the first half.

But just as things began to look 

comfortable for the Wolverines, 
Southern Mississippi caught fire, 
using a 9-0 run to close its deficit 
to one. 

And in the final moments 

of the first half, Golden Eagles 
guard Tyree Griffin stepped back 

and sunk a corner three to give 
Southern Mississippi a 33-32 lead 
going into the break.

Suddenly, 
the 
Wolverines 

were in another battle. 

The 
start 
of 
the 
second 

half provided back-and-forth, 
defensive-minded action, as the 
teams combined for just 13 points 
eight minutes into the frame.

Shortly 
later, 
strong 
ball 

movement 
allowed 
Michigan 

to have three consecutive open 
looks from the perimeter. After 
he missed the first two, Robinson 
connected from the left corner to 
give the Wolverines a lead they 
wouldn’t relinquish. 

Despite the win, Beilein wasn’t 

impressed with his offense, which 
stagnated at moments throughout 
the contest. Just 61 points on 13 
assists marks Michigan’s worst 
scoring output of the year. 

“Our 
offense 
was 
awful 

today,” Beilein said. “I think a 
lot of that has to do with the fact 

that we hadn’t played a game of 
man-offense since maybe our 
scrimmages. It was stagnant 
and not good, and the ball was 
sticking all over the place.”

But a bright spot on that end of 

the floor was Teske, who earned 
his first career double-double 
Thursday. 

Just as he did in the Wolverines’ 

first two games, Teske provided 
a spark off the bench. After 
hitting a 15-footer and grabbing 
a defensive rebound, Teske put 
back a missed Abdur-Rahkman 
3-pointer just moments after 
coming off the bench. 

“I’m just playing my game,” 

Teske said. “Guys are pushing me 
every day in practice and telling 
me that I’m capable of doing that. 
It just showed tonight.

“First double-double of my 

college 
career 
is 
definitely 

special. Now that I’m done with 
that, I know I have a lot more in 
the tank to give to this team.”

‘M’ taken for ride in whirlwind 
road defeat to No. 5 Louisville

The 
No. 
24 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team went 
on a rollercoaster Thursday 
night in Louisville.

And it was a bumpy one.
After leading by five after 

the first half, the Wolverines 
were outscored 42-12 in the 
final 
two 

quarters, 
falling 
to 
No. 

5 Louisville, 74-49, in the 
Preseason WNIT semifinals.

As with any rollercoaster, 

the beginning was manageable 
and Michigan looked to have 
properly fastened its seatbelt. 
The Wolverines started off hot, 
led by senior guard Katelynn 
Flaherty. She drained three 
consecutive 3-pointers early 
in the game to give her team 
a spark, and she tallied on 
another one before the quarter 
ended.

“Yeah, I mean 

we 
came 
out 

and 
we 
were 

able 
to 
make 

shots early,” said 
Michigan coach 
Kim 
Barnes 

Arico to WTKA. 
“Kate was off to 
a great start. We 
did a really good 
job 
of 
finding 

her early.”

The 
Cardinals 
played 

aggressively from the start 
with 
a 
defensive 
press 

— 
creating 
problems 
for 

Michigan. 
The 
Wolverines 

handled it well, though, with 
decisive ball movement that 
helped them make the most out 
of their scoring opportunities.

Michigan’s 
defense 
held 

up well throughout the first 
quarter, led by senior forward 
Jillian Dunston. She finished 
the night with 13 rebounds 
and five steals. The Cardinals 
still found the basket, though, 
and Michigan had a 22-21 

lead at the end of the quarter. 
The Wolverines seemed to be 
handling the ride well.

The 
second 
quarter 

was fairly smooth as well. 
Michigan found a steadier 
offensive tempo while Flaherty 
continued to shine, forcing a 
Louisville timeout.

The timeout was exactly 

what the Cardinals needed, 
though. They turned their 
defense up a notch, forcing 
more turnovers and not giving 
the Wolverines any space to 
operate. Michigan struggled to 
get shots up, and had multiple 
shot clock violations. Louisville 
maintained this tight defense 
until halftime, and started to 
look much stronger than the 
Wolverines, 
who 
somehow 

managed to hang on to a 37-32 
lead at halftime.

The 
end 
of 
the 
second 

quarter turned out to be a trial 
run for the rest of the game, as 
the Wolverines couldn’t hang 

on 
anymore. 

It 
was 
the 

point 
in 
the 

ride where you 
teeter 
at 
the 

top of the hill 
in anticipation, 
and then come 
plummeting 
down 
at 
full 

force 
— 
that 

period 
where 

you think you 
can 
handle 

it, and then a moment later 
everything takes a turn for the 
worst.

The Cardinals dominated 

the entire second half, going on 
a 7-0 run following halftime. 
The ride was rough for the 
Wolverines, who struggled to 
find the rim. They went nearly 
six minutes into the second 
half 
without 
scoring, 
and 

tallied just four points by the 
end of the third quarter. At that 
point, 
Louisville 
controlled 

all aspects of the game, and 
Michigan trailed by 10 points.

“We got really stagnant on 

offense, and I think we have 
to get better at that,” Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“They 
turned 

up their defense and they 
overplayed, 
and 
we 
didn’t 

handle the pressure as well as 
we’re capable of.”

Not much changed in the 

fourth quarter — just more 
bumps and rough patches. 
The Wolverines failed to box 
out well, and Louisville took 
advantage, finishing the game 
with 35 rebounds — 12 of which 
came on offense. To make 
matters worse, junior center 
Hallie Thome fouled out and 
everything started to collapse.

While it was a rough ride, 

Michigan still had positive 
takeaways from the game.

Before 
Thursday 
night, 

Flaherty 
needed 
just 
nine 

points to pass Diane Dietz’s 
program scoring record. She 
accomplished the feat in style 
with five 3-pointers, finishing 
with 23 points.

“I’ve heard about Katelynn 

since she’s been in about the 
third grade,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We lived in the same 
state and it was going around 
that there was this third grade 
girl that was incredible.”

“She was eight then (and) 

she’s 22 now and I’m lucky to 
be her coach,” Barnes Arico 
added. “She’s a legend. She’s 
a legend in the state of New 
Jersey, and she will be a legend 
at the University of Michigan.”

There 
was 
also 
the 

adrenaline 
rush 
when 
the 

Wolverines had the upper hand 
in the first half. They showed 
they can compete with high-
caliber teams, but now need to 
figure out how to do so for four 
quarters.

If Michigan does learn, it 

might be able to design the 
tracks moving forward.

“We have to use it for a 

learning tool,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We obviously have a long 
season ahead and have to move 
forward, and we saw what we 
are capable of in the first half.”
