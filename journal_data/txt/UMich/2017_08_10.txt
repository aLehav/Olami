Michigan’s talented linebackers primed for breakout season

“They did not see us. We made sure they didn’t.”

McCray, the lone returning 

defensive starter, taking on a 

leadership role

By JACOB SHAMES

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Before last season, Mike McCray had 

recorded just two tackles in his college 
career and had never started a game for 
the Michigan football team.

McCray, a former four-star recruit out 

of high school, had always shown promise 
— a blocked punt in a victory over Appala-
chian State in 2014 had displayed as much. 
But McCray couldn’t stay on the field — 
health problems, including a shoulder 
injury that sidelined him for the entire 
2015 season, derailed his first three years 
in a Wolverine uniform.

With the graduation of three senior 

linebackers — Joe Bolden, Desmond Mor-
gan and James Ross — a healthy McCray 
finally got his chance last year and ran 

with it. He made an immediate impact in 
his first start, a season-opening victory 
over Hawaii where he made nine tackles, 
3.5 for loss and two sacks, to kick-start an 
All-Big Ten Honorable Mention campaign 
in which he totalled 76 stops, including 
12.5 for a loss as well as 4.5 sacks and two 
interceptions.

One year later, the fifth-year senior 

linebacker is the only returning starter 
from the previous season’s dominant 
defense. But that’s not the only thing dif-
ferent about McCray, according to line-

backers coach Chris Partridge.

“There’s an aura about him that’s dif-

ferent than it was last year and that’s 
important because guys will look up to 
him,” Partridge said. “He’s a hard worker 
and he’s tough, he’s a Big Ten linebacker. 
Now with that aura about him and that 
sense of leadership he’s stepped his game 
up.”

To Partridge, McCray has carried him-

self in a different manner so far in fall 
camp — a manner that is essential. The 
omnipresent theme for Michigan — young 

Transgender individuals continue the 
struggle against possible military ban 

and healthcare complications

This article is the first part of a larger piece 

dedicated to the experiences of some transgender 
individuals. The second part will be available on 
michigandaily.com soon. 

It was 1974; Charin Davenport was 18 when 

she joined the military.

Despite opposing the Vietnam War, the 

teenager from Essexville, Mich., had many 
reasons for wanting to join the Navy. A need 
to give back to the country was one; there was 
also the desire to have more experiences out-
side of the town.

“I really wanted to see the world,” she said. 

“And I did. Another part of it was I had to get 
out of there. Because there was no future, 
short-term or long-term for me there.”

She also thought that joining the military 

would help her feel like more of the gender she 
was assigned to.

“I thought at that age … the problem was that 

I wasn’t a good enough man,” the now 61-year-
old Oakland University professor said. “And 

that the Navy would help me become that man, 
that would kind of man me up. And I talked to a 
lot of veterans who felt the same way. Because 
it’s kind of that hyper-masculine environment. 
And so, in that environment, surely I would 
become the man I was suppose to be and I so 
far failed at.”

Davenport was in the military for seven 

years. While she was not out in the military, she 
was aware of several of her fellow officers who 
were also trans.

“I was not out when I served,” she said. 

“That would have been a death sentence. The 
secrecy between ourselves was far beyond any 
top-secret clearance the military could have 
had. They did not know us. They did not see us. 
We made sure they didn’t.”

The reception of returning Vietnam and 

Korean soldiers was a national shame, Dav-
enport explained, since they were not treated 
with respect. With all of the debate, the presi-
dents at the time would at least be on the side 
of the troops.

“And then on that day, the President of the 

United States Donald Trump spit on us,” she 
said. “And said, ‘No no no you’re right, spit on 
them.’ And to me, that is absolutely despicable. 
And I was so angry. So hurt. And I will never 
stop saying that. I’m angry. So angry about it.”

“I hate war, let me be very clear about that,” 

she said. “But we can never lose that bond. We 
cannot lose that bond. And Donald Trump, our 
president that we elected in this country, basi-
cally told us to fuck off.”

“I will never feel any differently about what 

he did,” she said. “Analyze all you want — there 
is no analysis to be made. That’s what hap-
pened.”

The military ban 
Davenport is one of the approximate 

134,300 retired transgender veterans who 
have served in the U.S. military — a num-
ber that is difficult to pinpoint as the ban 
on transgender individuals was lifted just 
last year under the Obama administration. 
“Don’t ask, don’t tell,” the policy regarding 
sexual orientation, was discontinued in 2011, 
but repeal did not extend to gender identity 
— transgender individuals were deemed to 
have

Students voice concern 
that DOJ investigation 
will further marginalize 

minority groups

By CHETALI JAIN

Summer Daily News Editor

Last Monday, The New York 

Times 
uncovered 
the 
Trump 

administration’s intentions to fun-
nel Justice Department resources 
into examining and potentially fil-
ing lawsuits against colleges and 
universities who take racial back-
ground into consideration when 
making admissions decisions. Mil-
lions were left wondering what 
effect the investigation and pros-
ecution would have on students 
who come from underprivileged 
backgrounds.

Such considerations, or affirma-

tive action policies, were originally 
meant to level the playing field for 
disadvantaged 
applicants. 
Sup-

porters of affirmative action state 
such policies are meant to take into 
account the access an individual 
has to resources that make them 

a stronger college applicant. They 
would argue that groups such as 
African Americans and women 
who have historically been exclud-
ed from U.S. society are given a 
fair opportunity to succeed while 
opponents believe it fosters reverse 
racism. 

Though the U.S. Supreme Court 

deemed it constitutional for race to 
be a factor in admissions decisions, 
eight states have banned this con-
sideration, Michigan included.

According to Kim Broekhuizen, 

University of Michigan spokes-
woman, the University will con-
tinue to watch for developments in 
the matter.

“As always, the University fol-

lows all applicable state and federal 
laws,” Broekhuizen wrote in an 
email.

Despite the legal restriction of 

affirmative action policies at the 
University under Proposal 2, a 
measure which bans Michigan col-
leges from using race as a factor in 
their admissions decisions, minor-
ity students like recent University 
alum Will Royster still live in a 
reality where they face unfounded 
assumptions regarding their place 
on campus.

In an interview, Royster recalled 

how his identity as a Black male 
often caused people to question 
his intelligence and his reason for 
being at the University. Royster 
studied mathematics and African 
American studies during his time 
on campus and tutored other stu-
dents in mathematics. 

“People will naturally think 

I’m an athlete …(they) think I’m 
an athlete because I’m black and I 
go to the University of Michigan,” 
Royster said. “Or it’s constant 
probes about (my) intelligence … 
even when I was in the Engineer-
ing school, there would be times 
when people didn’t want to be in 
my group for a project not know-
ing that I had one of the highest 
grades in the class. Plenty of times 
I’m in my math class and I get A’s 
… and people didn’t want to be in 
my group. When I (tutor) someone 
that is of a more privileged identi-
ty … and I show him how to get the 
answer, and I was able to success-
fully do this, it’s a startling thing 
(for him).”

Other students and faculty 

members have also been affect-
ed by the controversial topic of 
affirmative action; this past win-
ter semester, 950 maize and blue 
chairs were placed in the Diag to 
signify the students from minority 
backgrounds who wouldn’t attend 
the University due to Proposal 2. 

Postdoctoral 
fellow 
Austin 

McCoy studies racial justice. In 
a message, he said the proposed 
investigation contradicts the real-
ity of race in admissions.

“The DOJ’s proposal to inves-

tigate colleges’ and universities’ 

affirmative action policies are 
based in a faulty assumption that 
race conscious forms of redress 
have a disparate impact on white 
Americans as a group,” he wrote. 
“This faulty assumption belies the 
fact, at least in the context of UM 
before the passage of Proposal 2, 
that white students tend to enjoy 
a higher rate of acceptance and 
admission 
despite 
race-based 

affirmative action policies.”

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel, public relations chair 
of College Democrats and a col-
umnist for the Daily, said the plans 
to look into intentional race-based 
discrimination will only hurt 
diversity and underprivileged stu-
dents.

“Trump’s assertion that white 

people are disadvantaged by affir-
mative action policies is absurd 
and damaging to students of color, 
who already feel alienated by pri-
marily white institutions,” Schan-
devel said.

Conversely, 
Amanda 
Dele-

kta, who is the vice president of 
internal affairs for the University 
chapter of College Republicans, 
believes it is not the responsibility 
of colleges to make considerations 
regarding a student’s background 
during the admissions process. In 
an email, she explained she feels 
that applicants should be select-
ed based on merit alone and that 
admission policies that take into 
account race are unjust.

“Affirmative action policies at col-

leges and universities are inherently

University students screen films 
at Traverse City Film Festival

University-wide 
collaboration on 

films impress 

festival audience 

By AMARA SHAIKH

Daily Staff Reporter

At the 13th annual Traverse 

City Film Festival, two short 
films created by University 
of Michigan undergraduates 
were showcased on the big 
screen. The five-day event fea-
tured a variety of films, work-
shops and discussions about 
filmmaking.

The two student produc-

tions, 
“Malignant 
Humor” 

and “Chasing the GOAT,” were 
developed 
throughout 
the 

semester by students in screen-
writing program director Jim 
Burnstein’s and lecturer Rob-
ert Rayher’s Screenwriting 423 
class and carried out with the 
help of fellow undergraduate 
writers, actors and producers.

Though his students provid-

ed the plot and stage direction, 
Burnstein said the productions 
required 
participation 
from 

across the University.

“Two teams are assembled 

out of (Screen Arts and Cul-
tures), with our top filmmaking 
students,” he said. “Then we 
bring in from Stamps School of 
Design art designers, costume 
designers, 
sound 
designers, 

composers from the School of 
Music and even producers from 
Ross School of Business. So it’s 
the University-wide kind of 
collaboration.”

Burnstein worked with the 

LSA Department of Screen 
Arts and Cultures to establish 
a partnership with the Tra-
verse City Film Festival that 
allows two University films to 
be showcased each year. Now 
in their ninth year of collabo-
ration, Burstein said attendees 
at the festival continue to be 
impressed with the talent of 
the students.

“This 
all 
started 
when 

Michael Moore, who runs the 
Traverse City Film Festival, 
and festival director Deb Lake 

contacted me asking if I would 
do something up there at the 
festival — meaning talk about 
screenwriting as a profession-
al screenwriter,” he said. “I 
agreed, but I said I would like 
to, in return, show a couple 
of the films that are made in 
the class. When we did it for 
the first time and when it was 
done, Michael Moore turned to 
me and said, ‘So we’re going to 
do this every year, right?’ And I 
replied, ‘Absolutely.’ ”

Malignant Humor, produced 

by LSA senior Matthew Bar-
nauskas, an Arts writer at the 
Daily, follows the story of an 
improv comedy troupe that, 
upon arriving at a high school 
they’re supposed to perform 
at, find out a student there has 
committed suicide.

“Malignant 
Humor” 
was 

the second film produced by 
Barnauskas. He said the most 
rewarding part of producing 
was seeing the finished prod-
uct.

“With 
producing, 
what 

you’re basically doing is you’re 
giving the supplies to others to 
do their work,” he said. “You’re 
giving locations, you’re making 
sure there is room for the crew, 
you’re making sure everything 
is locked down tight so your 
crew can go out and make the 
film they want to make.”

LSA senior Annie Cohen, the 

supervising editor for “Malig-
nant Humor,” expressed her 
excitement for the festival.

“I personally was incredibly 

excited to attend the festival 
and get to see the hard work of 
so many people projected for 
new audiences to enjoy,” she 
said. “By the time the festival 
rolled around, I had been work-
ing on the movie for about six 
months and was just so happy 
to be able to share the work 
that we did over the course of 
the winter semester with those 
involved. Many people who 
were involved with the produc-
tion, both cast and crew, hadn’t 
seen a final version of it all put 
together so it was amazing to 
hear their new thoughts on the 
movie that I had seen probably 
50 times already.”

Matthew Solomon, associate 

professor of film history and 
theory, was one of the mod-
erators invited to the festival 
to lead discussions about film 
with the audience. Solomon 
said he was also very impressed 
with the two student produc-
tions.

“I just think they’re tre-

mendously impressive high-
level 
productions 
done 
by 

undergrads,” 
he 
said. 
“It’s 

remarkable, 
the 
production 

values and the quality of those 
films always wows the audi-
ence at Traverse City, and it’s a 
great tradition that our depart-
ment has built.”

Solomon has been attending 

the festival for nearly six years 
now, and he recommends it to 
anyone who has an interest in 
film.

“It’s a really great festival,” 

he said. “It’s really nice to meet 
the filmmakers and have such 
a vibrant audience that loves 
movies around you, so it’s a 
great experience. I highly rec-
ommend it to anyone in the 
area who has any interest in 
films. It’s one of the best festi-
vals I’ve been to.”

Both Cohen and Barnauskas 

said they are excited to contin-
ue working in filmmaking, and 
said they were grateful to have 
their experience with the Tra-
verse City Film Festival help 
them with their goals.

“I hope to work in editing in 

the future once I graduate, so 
the festival definitely helped 
with that,” she said. “This was 
the first time that I had worked 
in a setting of many editors all 
working together to create a 
mass amount of content. The 
festival turns out daily vid-
eos of recaps from the day’s 
events that had been happen-
ing throughout the week. So 
although Kat and I were only 
working on a small part of the 
festival’s editing process it was 
definitely beneficial to learn 
how a space like that can be 
run.”

Next year, both Solomon and 

Burnstein intend on heading 
back to Traverse City for what 
will be the 10th anniversary of 
showcasing University films at 
the festival.

“psychosexual disorder.” 

The University of California, Los 

Angeles report now estimates about 
15,500 members are still on active 
duty. The U.S. military is often called 
the largest employer of transgender 
individuals in the world — Daven-
port estimates about 20 to 25 percent 
of the adult transgender community 
has served.

On July 26th, President Donald 

Trump sent out a series of tweets 
proposing a possible banon trans-
gender individuals from serving the 
military on the basis of high health 
care costs. 

The move faced negative reactions 

from the Democrats and mixed reac-
tions from the Republicans. The U.S. 
joint chiefs of staff were not aware 
the tweets were about to be made. As 
of Wednesday, five active duty trans-
gender individuals are suing Trump.

In Michigan, Democrat delegates 

also called the move “discrimina-
tory,” while many Republican del-
egates have yet to comment.

In Royal Oak, Samantha Rogers, 

founder of transgender organiza-
tion TG Detroit, held a rally in sup-
port of the troops in response to 
Trump’s tweet. With 400 people in 
attendance and no counterprotest-
ers, Rogers said it was a great turnout 
as the mayor and ex-mayor of Royal 
Oak spoke to the protestors and 
transgender veterans as well.

Rogers said she was told that it 

was the largest transgender-driven 
rally in Southeast Michigan.

“Frankly I was disappointed we 

didn’t have more people because of 
the nature of the situation,” she said.

LGBT Michigan President Emily 

Kaufman, an LSA senior at the Uni-
versity of Michigan and a transgen-
der woman, said Trump’s actions 
create a culture of discrimination.

“Now the conservative people on 

Fox News are talking about trans 
people, and they’re saying the mili-
tary is not a social experiment,” she 
said. “When their ignorant viewers 
are watching and being brainwashed 
by them, they think that’s the gospel 
truth. 

Kaufman said the ban would have 

a considerable impact on employ-
ment. 

“It will increase unemployment 

for trans people — the ones that 
are serving, if they get kicked out … 
The unemployment rate is already 
extremely high, because it’s legal to 
discriminate against trans people in 
most states in employment.”

She compared the abrupt pro-

posal of the ban and its repercus-

sions to the Trump administration’s 
guidance on transgender bathroom 
choice in February — forcing trans-
gender people to use the bathroom 
of the assigned birth gender. She said 
such discrimination appears to be 
becoming a trend — something that 
is unacceptable.

“By Trump doing this, it just sort 

of adds to the stereotypes about trans 
people not being fully human and it 
creates lots of problems,” she said. 
“I think saying or doing one thing — 
like with the bathroom bill — that’s 
bad enough. It’s starting to be a trend 
— and this is just out of the blue, he 
didn’t even discuss it with anyone. 
It really is just dehumanizing trans 
people by saying that.”

Lilianna Angel Reyes, Trans Sis-

tas of Color Project founder, said 
while she stands with her trans-
gender brothers and sisters in the 
military, she wanted to emphasize 
that the publicity the issue has 
received has been largely in con-
junction with only the white trans-
gender community. 

“There technically hasn’t been 

a policy change for banning trans 
people in the military, it was Twit-
ter,” she said. “It may be coming, 
but it hasn’t been official policy. 
But when people thought it was the 
possibility of a policy, they rallied. 
When different things are going on 
in the trans community on a larger 
level, they rally — by they, I mean 
mostly white trans people.”

According to Reyes, 16 transgen-

der women of color were killed in the 
first six months this year but have 
received little rally or support. Trans-
gender women of color are also pun-
ished with heavy prison sentences, 
she said. 

“So I think that it is very difficult 

— race always plays a part,” she said. 
“Racism is always alive.”

Reyes noted many transgender 

white people transition later in life 
— after they have had careers, stable 
jobs and homes. She said their transi-
tion — though still very impactful — is 
much different than that of a trans-
gender person of color who transi-
tions at 14 or 15, who could become 
homeless or have to partake in sex 
work.

“Many of my trans brothers and sis-

ters who are of color, who transitioned 
at 15 and 16, couldn’t have even went 
into the military when they were 18 
because they were noticeably trans,” 
she said. “They had already started 
their transition, and at that point they 
could very well push you out of the mili-
tary and not let you go in...”

MORDARSKI

Short-term memory

R

ecently, on an early Monday 
morning, I was sitting in a 
crowded coffee shop sipping a 

large cup of scalding anxiety stimulant 
as I awaited an upcoming interview for 
an internship. I was running on a restful 
three hours of 
sleep due to the 
after effects of 
spending 
my 

Saturday 
night 

enthusiastically 
switching from bar to bar with old friends. 
So, extremely anxious and lacking in sleep, 
my progress of memorizing answers for 
the interview ahead was interrupted by 
some nostalgia.

Because in front of my table, a young 

boy and his mother were waiting to order. 
And just as I looked up, I caught what 
was just a typical and casual moment 
between them. He was being a kid, 
curiously looking into the cooler near the 
counter at the several treats and drinks 
while holding onto the leg of his mother. 
And she, while answering his innocent 
questions, casually reached down and ran 
her hand through his hair. He looked up 
and smiled at her.

And then there I was, the anxious, 

bloodshot-eyed, 21 year old in a suit, 
staring at these two like a madman. 
My mind, triggered from such a typical 
interaction between mother and child, 
had a nostalgia-fueled recollection of the 
countless days I spent literally looking 
up to my mother while enjoying the 
innocence of childhood. And now here 
I was, a young man in his brand new 
suit, anxiously awaiting a prestigious 
interview, nursing a large coffee to combat 
his exhaustion from an exciting weekend 
— only there because of the undying love 
and effort from his two parents.

Because I often delude myself into 

believing I am a partially self-made 
“man.” That my intelligence, work ethic 
and personality have been, and are being, 
further enhanced and crafted by my 
intervention solely. That obviously I am 
extremely thankful for benefitting from 
the massive investments and work my 
parents did for me, such as the private 
school education, excellent health care 
and lessons in morality and manners — 
but I fool myself into the thinking that my 
more recent past, which has been greatly 
controlled by me, has led me into my 
promising future.

And all it takes is a kid who vaguely 

looks like me to smile at his mother to 
trigger the wave of memories I often 
repress of the undying love my parents 
demonstrated toward me. Not just the 
big things, but more so, the thousands and 
thousands of small interactions we had 
that unfortunately I cannot remember. 
These small expressions of love that 
add up instilling a sense of worth and 
character within a child that I as a self-

serving 21 year old cannot even begin to 
grasp how much effort is required to do 
so.

Former President Obama explained 

this instilled love from the efforts of 
parents best in “The Audacity of Hope.” 
Writing about his daughter’s birthday 
party he explained, “I wonder if Sasha 
will remember that moment when she 
is grown. Probably not; it seems as if I 
can retrieve only the barest fragments 
of memory from when I was five. But 
I suspect that the happiness she felt on 
that (day) registers permanently in her; 
that such moments accumulate and 
embed themselves in a child’s character, 
becoming a part of their soul.”

And that is exactly what happened 

with my parents and I. The countless 
moments and expressions of love my 
parents had toward a young me gave me 
that sense of worth and confidence which 
allow me to passionately pursue my 
future. My qualities and work ethic come 
from the fact that there were people in my 
childhood who loved me unconditionally 
and gave me some sense of worth. But 
the enthusiasm I have of the future 
often can blind me of that past. I’m full 
of energy, excited about what lies ahead 
and constantly preoccupied dreaming 
about what could be in a way that only 
an educated, adept and ignorant young 
person can.

And my parents catch the collateral of 

this. The young boy they raised, the one 
who held their hand so tightly, crawled 
into their bed when he had nightmares 
and asked them thousands of innocent 
questions about the world, is now so 
focused on the present to determine his 
future that his focus often blinds him 
from the previous effort and love they put 
into him. My short-term memory hurts 
them.

I’m busy, preoccupied and always 

excited for the next chapter. But now, 
I’m not entering a new chapter, but a 
completely new volume of life. One 
that feels far more independent 
and exciting but has changed the 
relationship between me and my 
parents. I now have adult problems, 
problems like they have. Sometimes, 
I forget how much I cherish those 
thousands of hours that weren’t 
particularly special or important, 
just brief moments with the people 
who loved me and raised me. And I 
can take some comfort in knowing 
that my ever-present nostalgia will 
constantly remind me of that.

I’m sorry I’m getting older, mom and 

dad, I can’t help it. I’m busy thinking I can 
change the world.

A

s popular culture suggests, 
adolescence is a time that 
social lives are expected of us. 

With the rise of smartphones and social 
media, the daily flood of Snapchat 
stories and Instagram pictures imply 
more than ever that the best of times 
are had in groups — whether it be 
friends, families or even strangers.

The social taboo against being 

alone is understood since an early age. 
Those who are seen alone are labeled 
laughable and perceived as having 
neither friends nor something better to 
do (enter “when all two of your friends 
are busy” meme).

In high school, I was very much 

alone in this sense. As the result of a 
severe case of strict parents, I spent 
90 percent of my free time isolated in 
my bedroom, my social life confined 
entirely to iMessage and Facebook 
messenger.

But in college, things are different. 

As I met more people and made more 
friends throughout my first year, I 
found myself increasingly accustomed 
to being with others in every area 
of my life — whether it be attending 
lecture, eating, studying or doing the 
bare minimum on a Sunday afternoon. 
Essentially, there is nothing stopping 
any of us from spending every waking 
(and non-waking) hour with company. 
We’re surrounded by people of the 
same age, walking in the same shoes 
and carrying the same social burdens. 
There’s really no excuse to be alone.

Thus, the social dynamic of this 

summer came as a shock to me. With 
the whole campus on a hiatus from 
its usual bustling energy and only 
a few select friends remaining on 
campus, there were no more classes 
to study for together, no student 
activities to summon a crowd, no 
dining hall to serve as a convenient 
meetup site. Many days, I had no 

choice but to be alone.

As summer went on, I became 

suddenly very aware of my lack of plans 
after work and on weekends, which 
both discomforted and disheartened 
me. While I was thankful for the time 
to relax from the chaos of the school 
year, I was unaccustomed to excessive 
free time and saw my lack of plans as 
a personal setback. As I lie in bed for 
hours on end watching “Friends” at 
an inconceivably rapid rate, I couldn’t 
help feeling sorry for myself. Every 
Snapchat story seemed to be an implicit 
jab at my own seclusion, the negative 

connotation of solitude manifesting 
itself as if on demand.

Amid it all, I was forgetting that 

solitude itself is harmless. Sick of 
meaningless self-pity, I finally asked 
myself: in a world without social 
expectations and stereotypes, what’s 
wrong with being alone? If there was no 
social media, no way of comparing my 
own life to others, would my solitude 
still seem so strange, so unacceptable?

Absolutely not, I thought. There is 

nothing wrong with being alone.

Of course, this is not to say that 

we should avoid social interaction 
altogether. While it’s always healthy 
to spend time with others, quality time 
alone should never be underrated.

Remember, there are two ways of 

being alone. The first is loneliness; my 
high-school self is a good example. 
I was averse to company, actively 

withdrawing from social situations due 
to personal insecurities and strained 
relationships. 
It 
was 
completely 

unhealthy and a problem I’m happy to 
leave in the past.

The second is solitude, a wholesome 

state of aloneness marked by peacefulness, 
privacy and comfort with oneself. And 
only when I learned to accept solitude was 
I able to recognize its value.

In a sense, solitude requires self-

confidence to enjoy; when notions of 
social incompetence and superficial 
perceptions are abandoned, it is in fact 
an essential component to a healthy 
social life.

Realizing this, I finally crawled out 

of bed and stopped scrolling through 
the endless internet feeds, using my 
time alone to catch up on personal 
activities that I’m unable to do in the 
presence of other people (and no, I do 
not mean Netflix!). As I reconnected 
with my violin skills, sang old songs at 
the top of my lungs, immersed myself 
in adult coloring books and wrote my 
first poetry in months, my free time 
effortlessly flew by. Strangely, I felt 
tangibly in touch with my whole self, 
but I couldn’t have done it had I not 
been alone.

Of course, I will always welcome a 

good day spent with friends and will 
surely continue to make new ones this 
fall. However, I’ve learned to embrace 
solitude, knowing that no plans should 
be made solely to escape being alone 
— to do so would be to escape the only 
person with which I would spend my 
entire life.

From time to time, we all need 

to wind down and appreciate some 
quality time with ourselves. Don’t 
worry, the silence won’t be awkward.

“

OK, class,” my teacher yells across 
the classroom. “Father is coming 
to talk to us today, and I need you 

all to be on your best behavior!” It was 
days like these 
I enjoyed as a 
grade 
schooler 

at 
a 
Catholic 

elementary 
school: a change 
in direction and new questions. 
When Father enters the classroom, 
we all stand and say hello. He goes 
to the board and begins to explain 
the religious lesson on Genesis, 
interestingly enough.

I increasingly had become more 

involved 
in 
the 
light 
scientific 

readings that only a nine year old 
could understand, and my skepticism 
of the early teachings of the Church, 
especially Genesis, was quite high. 
Nevertheless, Father spoke to us about 
how God created Earth in seven days, 
how Adam named the animals, how 
Eve came from Adam’s rib and how the 
Devil tempted Eve with the forbidden 
fruit. To me, even as a nine year old, this 
all sounded like hogwash.

To change the direction of the 

lesson, I raised my hand and stated, “I 
have been reading about the Big Bang 
Theory. Have you read on this?” Father 
paused. “Yes, and it is good that you 
bring this up! Genesis is a description of 
how our Earth was created, but God’s 
days might be different than ours, and 
the length of time for him might seem 
like seven days, but for us millions of 
years. The Big Bang is an answer to 
that.” A voice popped up in the corner: 
“But that isn’t what it says though?” I 
added, “Aren’t we told that the Bible 
is the word of God? Does he want us 
to guess? If we have this doubt in the 
wording, how can we trust God’s words 
to begin with? Father said, “That is 
exactly what you should do. Question.”

I am presently a practicing Catholic. 

Before attending the University of 
Michigan, I attended Catholic grade 
school and classes until I was 17 years 
old, when I was confirmed. Throughout 
all of this, I have been, at one time, an 
agnostic, an extreme doubter of Jesus’s 
existence, and outspoken about my 
issues with the Church. Today, I am 
still quite skeptical of the Church’s 
teachings, but I still go to mass every 
week, read at church and participate 

in my local parish’s activities. Why, you 
might ask? Because doubt and debate 
are good. Questions about existentialism 
are good. The Church’s preaching of 
introspection is good.

In our modern culture where I 

see introspection and inquiry dying, 
I find that regardless of the church’s 
teachings, it is in these habits that I 
appreciate most. I owe a large part 
of my curiosity to my involvement 
in the Catholic church, where I was 
encouraged to question the existence 
of God, query my own self-worth and 
analyze the world around me.

I often tell people that constant self-

questioning is needed for improvement. 
The Church consistently asks us to look 
inside us to find areas in which we 
need to improve. While many would 
question the Church’s prescription 
(more time spent in prayer and time 
reading the Bible), it is the practice 
in itself that I find most appealing. 
Often, I find that in our modern 
society, people would much rather 
mindlessly scroll through Facebook 
or Twitter, watch endless hours of a 
television show and go out partying. 
While these might be fine in some 
amounts, it is what these activities are 
delaying that I am frustrated with. 
When interacting with my peers at 
the University, I am surprised with 
how many are frightened to look inside 
themselves for faults. This is also not 
just within our generation, but a more 
common problem. A 2014 Harvard 
and University of Virginia study found 
that most of the participants, all college 
students, would rather be electrically 
shocked than spend time in his or her 
own thoughts.

While I should not be taken as a 

model of introspection, I appreciate 
that the Church focuses on developing 
this side of us as humans. Too often 
today, we are quick to blame others 
and society as the issue, when often we 
don’t take a second to ponder our own 
thoughts and faults. Sometime it isn’t 
society’s fault, it is of your own doing. If 
one does, it is the fear of change and work 
needed for self-development that deters 
a sizeable part of the population. The 
Church’s advocacy for this constant self-
improvement is an important message 
many should listen to.

Though there are large sections 

of the Church that deter questioning 

God’s existence, my experience as 
a Catholic growing up encouraged 
this. For me, I think this fueled and 
developed a sense of intellectual 
curiosity, which is especially needed 
in today’s college culture. Not only 
that, but asking questions about 
existentialism, why certain behaviors 
occur, what does it mean to be human 
and countless other philosophical 
inquiries not only helps improve one’s 
sense of self, but also helps one come 
to a better understanding of what it 
means to be human.

In addition, the questioning of the 

Bible’s verses creates a sense of doubt 
in everything. For me, it has aided me 
in realizing bias. When I am reading 
an article from the New York Times 
or watching an interview on Fox 
News, I am constantly skeptical of 
the writing, looking for the particular 
parts that highlight its leaning. In 
addition, the Church’s promotion of 
doubt also makes me seek a difference 
of opinion, something I find lost on 
college campuses today. Though many 
believe they accept diversity of opinion, 
it is only when conflict occurs within 
one’s psyche that the inquiry stops. The 
Church, in my experience, has pushed 
me to enter in questioning the positions 
of others and why he or she came to 
that conclusion. I greatly appreciate 
that this doubt and advocacy for 
inquisitiveness was present in my early 
life and continues to be present.

Faith is, in my own definition, 

the 
suspension 
of 
rationale 
in 

support of something that cannot be 
conclusively 
determined. 
Though 

this is obviously the cornerstone of 
the Catholic Church and creates great 
conflict in today’s secular world, the 
underlying teachings of self-analysis 
and questioning existentialism are 
habits that modern culture should 
take into consideration. My questions 
surrounding my faith have aided my 
work in the neurosciences, my school 
and my daily life. I have found that the 
more I question my faith, the stronger I 
become as a person.

Catholic Education in a modern world

less one wanders the city, the scarier it 

becomes.

While I’ve been verbally harassed 

riding my bike through the Near East 

Side, I was harassed more frequently 

by passers-by when I used to go on 

long jogs through the streets of Bexley. 

Riding through the neighborhoods 

between 
Bexley 
and 
downtown 

Columbus, it seems any sense of 

tension or fear I feel is due more to my 

own preconceptions than the actions of 

the people I encounter there.

DETWILER

Through the Heart of It All
A

s a white girl/woman growing 

up in the wealthier and whiter 

areas 
of 
Columbus, 
I’ve 

been taught to think of the inner-city 

neighborhoods 

of 
the 
city’s 

Near East Side 

as crime-ridden, 

scary 
and 

dangerous. This 

implies that the suburb where I live is 

crime free, welcoming and safe. But 

nearly three months of commuting 

via bike from my mom’s house in the 

suburbs to the downtown restaurant 

where I’m working this summer 

has spurred an ongoing process of 

examining my own prejudices.

In the Franklin Park neighborhood, 

which runs behind a sizeable park and 

conservatory, the homes are huge and 

beautiful, built for the city’s wealthiest 

families — mostly white — at the 

start of the 20th century. But by 1936, 

the areas just outside the park were 

subject to the infamous discriminatory 

housing practice of redlining. Much 

of the Franklin Park neighborhood 

was coded as declining in desirability, 

and since then, it seems that racial 

and economic segregation between 

Franklin Park and Bexley has only 

become more severe.

As I’ve spent more time in the 

neighborhoods of the Near East 

Side, I’ve grown more comfortable 

there and have had lots of brief 

interactions with people who live 

there. These interactions have been 

new experiences for me, since the Near 

East Side has more Black inhabitants 

than the spaces I typically occupy, and 

they’ve prompted me to do a lot of self-

reflection.

Interactions 
that 
have 
been 

particularly thought provoking for 

me are the ones I’ve had with older 

Black men. Because, over the course 

of time, I’ve been verbally harassed 

repeatedly by older men I don’t know, I 

am automatically on guard from sexual 

objectification when I encounter older 

men on the street. Often, it seems that 

to behave defensively is to act in my 

own best interest, because harassment 

is frequent. I’ve noticed, however, that 

I haven’t felt objectified in any of the 

brief interactions I’ve had with older 

Black men on my bike commute. On 

the contrary, I’ve felt surprised at how 

friendly and utterly platonic our brief 

exchanges of “hellos” have been.

What I want to interrogate here 

is not whether the Black men I’ve 

encountered have been friendly to me 

— they have, unquestionably. What I 

want to interrogate is this feeling of 

surprise I’ve had when the interactions 

are just that — friendly. Why am I 

surprised when this happens? Yes, 

I do anticipate, even expect, men on 

the street generally to treat me with a 

certain degree of objectification. But 

is this expectation intensified when 

I encounter a Black man? I know 

society teaches me that Black men are 

overly sexual, but I like to think, as 

the “educated progressive” I identify 

as, that I’m impervious to these racist 

influences.

The more sympathetic theory I have 

to explain my reaction of surprise is 

this: most of the spaces I occupy are 

populated in majority by white people. 

The neighborhoods I live in and the 

sidewalks I walk down, the schools 

I’ve gone to, the restaurants I go to, 

concerts and festivals I attend, do not 

attract a lot of Black people, and they 

attract even fewer Black men over the 

age of 40 who are less affluent than I 

am. Since I rarely encounter the kinds 

of Black men I encounter on my bike 

commute, interactions with them 

have not played a part in my process 

of constructing my expectations for 

older men generally. Therefore, I am 

surprised because their friendliness 

has contradicted my expectations for 

older men, rather than contradicting 

my expectations of older Black men.

But I don’t know. Am I just making 

excuses for myself? Why do I really feel 

surprised when an interaction with a 

Black man is nothing but friendly, even 

to the point of being unmentionable?

This brings me to another question: 

Would the older Black men I’ve 

encountered have been equally as 

friendly to me if I looked like I lived 

in that neighborhood? Would they 

be friendlier to a neighbor they know 

better? Are they as friendly to other 

strangers they encounter — say, 

wealthy looking white men I’ve seen 

pass through on their road bikes? 

Were the men I’ve greeted thinking 

about how they should respond to 

my presence, or were they acting 

naturally? I don’t know, and I don’t 

presume I could authoritatively guess 

at these individuals’ experiences.

Though society has taught me 

to fear the higher crime rates of the 

neighborhoods between Bexley and 

downtown, the scariest part of my 

commute has been examining my 

own racial prejudices and, through 

the process of writing this column, 

confronting my white fragility.

In “Wanderlust: A History of 

Walking,” Rebecca Solnit, another 

white woman who I’d characterize 

as progressive, writes on the subject 

of walking through cities. But I think 

much of what she says can also be 

applied to biking: that it’s about being 

outside in public space, and that the

It’s no secret that our generation 

is one that is obsessed with itself. 
Narcissism runs deep in the roots 
of millennial culture, with social 
media being the main vehicle of 
maintaining a satisfactory virtual 
self-image. “Ingrid Goes West,” 
a new indie comedy starring the 
inimitable Aubrey Plaza (“The Little 
Hours”), searches to deconstruct 
this issue in the most twisted way 
possible.

After a stint in a mental 

institution, the film’s title character, 
played by Plaza, decides to head 
to Los Angeles in search of a new 
life and a new BFF in Instagram 
influencer Taylor Sloane (Elizabeth 
Olsen, “Wind River”). Using a hefty 
inheritance from her deceased 
mother, 
Ingrid’s 
excursions 
to 

become exactly like Taylor — dying 
her hair the same shade of blonde, 
buying the same Joan Didion novel, 
eating the same vegan enchilada 
— lead to both disturbing and 
hysterical results. Once Ingrid gets 
acquainted with Taylor and her 
pretentious husband Ezra (a great 
Wyatt Russell, “Everybody Wants 
Some!!”), her obsession slowly turns 
into a very, very dark journey of 
misguided desire.

Despite how uncomfortable it is 

to see Ingrid put herself through this 
experience, it’s not far from reality. 
In a way, Ingrid represents all 
those who feel lost and seek to find 
meaning and solace in the “unique” 
personalities that live on social 
media. “Ingrid Goes West” prevails 
overall as a satire on identity in the 
modern age. At times, the themes 
of social media and self-image skim 
the surface of being heavy-handed 
and exploitative, kind of like Jason 
Reitman’s similarly themed “Men, 
Women & Children.” But what 
that movie lacked in nuance and 
depth, “Ingrid Goes West” makes 
up for with heart and intelligent 
storytelling.

Perhaps “Ingrid Goes West” 

wouldn’t be nearly as absorbing 

without 
its 
incredible 
acting. 

Plaza, 
in 
particular, 
gives 
a 

layered 
lead 
performance 
as 

Ingrid, complementing her usual 
deadpan 
expressions 
with 
a 

profound, 
relatable 
loneliness. 

Olsen nails the Instagram queen 
personality, neither downplaying 
nor exaggerating the artifice of her 
character. Both O’Shea Jackson Jr. 
(“Straight Outta Compton”) and 
character actor Billy Magnussen 
(“Friends from College”) nearly 
steal the show. Jackson Jr. imbues 
irresistible charm into Ingrid’s vape-
smoking landlord/romantic interest 
Dan, while Magnussen’s role as 
Taylor’s douchey brother Nicky has 
the actor sliding from deceptively 
beguiling to off-the-wall bonkers.

Along with the brilliant cast, 

“Ingrid Goes West” also benefits 
from nifty aesthetic sleekness. Bryce 
Fortner’s cinematography saturates 
his shots with pulpy neon colors 
and lurid day-glo undertones. The 
script, written by David Branson 
Smith and director Matt Spicer, 
tackles timely themes, though the 
millennial 
slang 
and 
excessive 

hashtags will induce some eye-
rolling. Even the traditional, string-
heavy score stands out as the film’s 
most underrated aspect, bringing 
a nice, contrapuntal touch to the 
story’s postmodern vibe.

As entertaining and well-

acted as it is, “Ingrid Goes West” 
is not a perfect film, nor is it 
groundbreaking. Much like its 
protagonist, “Ingrid Goes West” 
feels like it can go off the edge 
at any moment of its brisk 97 
minute runtime. The opening 
scene, in which a devastated 
Ingrid assaults her ex-best friend 
Charlotte with mace, makes for a 
rather unpleasant introduction. 
There’s an intense, semi-crime 
thriller bit in the third act that 
almost pushes the film’s tone off 
balance. And for some, Ingrid’s 
character may be grating and 
even unbearable, as we watch her 
lie and cheat her way to become 
Taylor’s best friend. The point 
of her actions and their ultimate 
consequences 
makes 
for 
a 

simplistic lesson on the façade of 
living a filtered lifestyle, a lesson 
that could be encapsulated in a 
simple tweet.

The story behind “Detroit” is still 

as relevant today as it was in the late 
’60s. To this day, African-Americans 
suffer from repulsive police brutality 
and crippling institutional racism. 
Kathryn Bigelow’s (“Zero Dark 
Thirty”) retelling of the Algiers 
Motel incident during the 1967 
Detroit Riot is a graphic, brutally 
honest recount of the menacing 
mistreatment of Blacks at the hands 
of white police officers during one 
of the bleakest moments of the 20th 
Century.

“Detroit” 
introduces 
the 

beginning of the Riot on July 23rd, 
1967 following a police raid on a club 
welcoming home Black veterans 
from Vietnam. Other historical 
moments are documented, like 
Rep. John Conyers’s plea to stop 
the violence, along with Gov. 
George Romney’s deployment of 
the National Guard. Instantly, we 
are thrown into the mayhem and 
introduced to the characters who 
would later be involved in the Algiers 
incident. The madness unfolds 
rapidly, and throughout the first 
two-thirds of the movie, there isn’t 
a moment to catch your breath while 
watching the painful police brutality 
and destruction of the city.

The story is told in three acts, 

the first serving as an introduction 
to the characters and how they 
ended up in the Algiers Motel. Act 
two focuses on the incident itself, 
while the third shows the resulting 
court cases. Although each act is 
connected, they all feel like their 
own independent movie, differing 
in both pace and tension. Mark Boal 
(“Zero Dark Thirty”), journalist 
and frequent collaborator with 
Bigelow, packs a lot of intensity 
into the first two acts. The third, 

however, drags: After witnessing 
the horrors at the Motel, the rest 
of the movie feels especially slow 
and unrewarding. The 143-minute 
running time could have been cut 
to a more manageable length, but 
doing so would require sacrificing 
vital historical information. Either 
way, a courtroom drama ending is 
lackluster in comparison to the prior 
events.

Every shot and moment in the 

Motel is painful to watch, mostly 
because messes like this do occur. 
The police’s incompetence and 
everyone’s visceral fear boils over 
into a situation where every possible 
thing that could go wrong does. 
Here, Bigelow boasts her knack at 
building tension and showing utter 
chaos candidly. The camera is always 

moving, and with each cut between 
the police and their suspects — 
hostages, 
rather 
— 
everything 

intensifies. These moments are 
some of Bigelow’s most outwardly 
suspenseful, even considering “The 
Hurt 
Locker”’s 
bomb 
disposal 

scenes. 

Will Poulter (“The Revenant”) 

stars as Philip Krauss, a Detroit police 
officer who we first see fatally shoot a 
running Black shoplifter in the back. 
After returning to duty, he continues 
to cause harm, initiating the raid on 
the Algiers and killing an unarmed 
tenant. Krauss is a bitter taste of evil. 
He tries to cover up his wrongdoings 
— murdering innocent Black men 
in the Motel — by placing knives 
near the dead bodies to create the 

appearance that they were armed. 
I would like to know if this form of 
racism, paranoia and sloppiness still 
exists in the police force, though, I 
probably shouldn’t ask questions I 
don’t want the answers to. Poulter 
gives a performance worthy of an 
Oscar nom and sets the standard for 
portraying a realistic antagonist.

In an ensemble cast, Poulter is 

accompanied by many other actors 
in their prime, like “Star Wars: The 
Force Awakens”’s John Boyega, 
playing a security guard who tries 
to ease the tension. Hannah Murray 
(“Game of Thrones”) plays Julie, 
one of two white women abused 
by the police during the incident. 
We even see John Krasinski (“The 
Office”) play an attorney defending 
the police officers in the movie’s 
third act. But ultimately, it’s Algee 
Smith’s (“The New Edition Story”) 
role as Larry Reed, singer for the 
R&B group The Dramatics, that 
stands out as the most believable. 
When he walks onstage to an empty 
Fox Theater, his presence feels real, 
making the audience feel like they’re 
struggling with him through his 
pursuit for success. Bigelow forces 
the best possible performances out 
of every actor, and without such vivid 
representations of actual people, the 
movie would flounder and be nothing 
more than a C-grade History Channel 
documentary.

For those who tote “Blue Lives 

Matter” insignia and proudly say “all 
lives matter,” “Detroit” should be first 
on the what-to-watch-next queue. 
It openly shows police acting with 
dangerous biases in ways that are not 
in the public’s best interest. At a time 
when our culture is more divided 
than united, “Detroit” is an invaluable 
movie to demonstrate that history 
does, in fact, repeat itself. Although 
flawed, it’s another gripping movie to

Tal Klein discusses sci-fi 
debut novel ‘The Punch’ 

With his debut novel “The 

Punch 
Escrow,” 
author 
Tal 

Klein constructs a thrilling and 
thought-provoking 
narrative 

that blends the realms of love 
stories, hard science fiction and 
reeling suspense in one cohesive 
and addicting work. Set in the 
near future, the world of “The 
Punch Escrow” is characterized 
by teleportation as the dominant 
means of transportation as well 
as the shadowy corporation that 
controls it. The novel follows 
protagonist Joel Byram after he 
is accidentally duplicated mid-
transport and must confront 
the ensuing consequences to his 
autonomy and his marriage. In an 
interview with the Daily, Klein 
discussed his fascination with 
teleportation, his writing process 
and the cinematic potential for 
the world of “The Punch Escrow.”

Klein’s novel exists in the 

genre of hard science fiction, a 

niche category of sci-fi defined 
by its commitment to scientific 
accuracy within the fictional 
narrative. Before writing his 
novel, Klein spent three years 
doing 
rigorous 
research 
to 

understand the intricacies of 
his imagined technology and 
ensure its feasibility. The pages 
of “The Punch Escrow” are 
distinctly characterized by the 
massive footnotes at the bottom 
of almost every page, in which 
the protagonist explains the real 
science behind the seemingly 
imagined concepts and tech. 
Klein’s fluid movement between 
literary voice and scientific fact 
sets his novel apart from others 
in its genre. Teleportation in 
the novel acts as a catalyst 

for the novel’s major conflict. 
As 
a 
marketing 
executive, 

teleportation 
holds 
certain 

interest for Klein beyond its 
scientific challenges.

“I think the thing that really 

attracted me to teleportation was 
that I was told it was impossible. 
And, you know, I’m a startup 
guy. I’m an entrepreneur, and I 
started companies, and I market 
products, and whenever someone 
tells me something is impossible 
I see that as a challenge... I 
wanted to find an origin story 
for the commercialization of 
teleportation, 
like 
when 
did 

it 
become 
anthropologically 

accepted by society, and then put 
a plot inside that world,” he said.

“The 
Punch 
Escrow” 
also 

deals largely with the theme of 
societal control by a dominant 
and 
secretive 
corporation. 

This theme is largely present 
in contemporary society, with 
Snowden’s 
revelation 
of 
the 

NSA’s 
civilian 
monitoring 

programs and the practice of 
internet companies collecting 
and selling user data. When 
asked 
about 
these 
literary 

themes in conjunction with their 
presence in the real world Klein 
explained, “I think one of the 
things we have to accept is that 
as society evolves, data becomes 
currency, 
telemetry 
becomes 

currency... I don’t advocate for 
that kind of world in the book, 
and I don’t warn about that kind 
of world in the book — I see it as 
a pragmatic continuance of the 
current vector that our society’s 
on today.”

“What I do see is a large 

disenfranchisement in the world 
with this notion of governmental 
control and I think the way I 
drew corporations in my book is 
not so much corporate takeover 
of governments — it’s more 
presented in the context of people 
revolting 
against 
the 
notion 

of being managed by things 
they 
don’t 
understand. 
And 

corporations, although they may 
be capitalistic and greedy, are at 
least defined by profits and losses 
which are tangible things we can 
grasp onto,” he added.

While Klein is a successful 

chief marketing officer, he is new 
to the process of writing novels. 

In describing his writing process, 
Klein remarked on the surprises 
of being challenged after already 
achieving professional success. 
“What surprised me is how 
humbling the editorial process 
can be. It’s ruthless. And I’m 
40, so I felt like I’ve gotten to 
an age where I no longer have to 
be humble.” Regardless, Klein 

emphasized 
the 
welcomed 

humility of the process and his 
reignited passion for writing: 
“If I could change anything, 
I would have started writing 
novels earlier in life, because I’ve 
found a lot of zen in the process 
of writing.”

Klein and his team recently 

negotiated 
a 
landmark 
deal 

with Lionsgate for “The Punch 
Escrow” and two subsequent 
books. 
As 
the 
books 
don’t 

necessarily have to be sequels, 
Klein 
is 
excited 
to 
explore 

aspects of his imagined world 
that were only hinted at in “The 
Punch Escrow.” What’s next for 
Klein is another period of heavy 
research, furious writing in the 
stolen hours of the night and 
hopefully “The Punch Escrow” 
on the silver screen.

“There’s 
a 
lot 
of 
things 

that happen in ‘The Punch 
Escrow’ that I spent a lot of 
time researching that obviously 
didn’t make it into the book... 
So right now, I think in a lot 
of ways what I’m doing is a 
lot of research. Right now I’m 
researching ‘The Last War,’ and 
I’m reading a lot of books on 
letters from the front, soldiers 
from World War I and World 
War II. Lionsgate calls this 
project ‘The Future,’ they don’t 
call it ‘The Punch Escrow,’ 
because they bought a world,” 
he said.

SYDNEY COHEN

Daily Arts Writer

Of his 56 novels written over 

43 years, Stephen King has 
most often referred to his eight-
volume epic “The Dark Tower” 
as his magnum opus. Spanning 
multiple 
genres 
and 
literary 

universes, the series tells the 
story of Roland Deschain, the 
last of a noble group of pseudo-
knights called gunslingers, who 
constantly strives to reach the 
titular tower, which functions as 

a kind of lynchpin at the center 
of the multiverse, keeping the 
forces of darkness at bay.

Due to the at times outlandish 

nature of the books, a direct 
adaptation would have been 
nearly impossible. There’s even 
an argument to be made that to 
have done so would have missed 
the point of them entirely, as one 
of the major themes of the series 
is the power of art to create new 
worlds. The problem with the 
adaptation of “The Dark Tower” 
isn’t that changes were made. 
It’s that the changes that were 
made resulted in a film that only 
fleetingly brushes up against the 
epic tone to which it aspires.

The most baffling of director 

Nikolaj Arcel’s creative decisions 
comes into focus early on, as much 

of the focus takes place in the real 
world as opposed to more fantastic 
settings. Early scenes are devoted 
almost entirely to the relationship 
between Jake Chambers (Tom 
Taylor, “Broken Hearts”) and 
his family, as the young boy feels 
distanced from his family due 
to visions of the Dark Tower. 
Not only is this type of broken 
family dynamic — communicated 
through longing glances at photos 
of happier times — commonplace, 
but it is at a total disconnect with 
the rest of the story. Was there 
really no better way to begin an 
epic western-fantasy-horror piece 
than with 20 minutes of generic 
family drama?

What’s more is that after a 

brief jaunt to Mid-World, a post-
apocalyptic alternate dimension, 
the drama returns to New York 
City so Roland (Idris Elba, “Star 
Trek Beyond”) can partake in 
fish-out-of-water jokes. It’s not 
that Elba doesn’t sell the humor 
of the moments, or even that 
humor itself is unwelcome, but 
juxtaposed against a quest to save 
an infinite array of universes from 
an impending army of Satanic 
creatures, these kind of jokes have 
not only been done before, but 
they feel completely out of place.

Perhaps 
what’s 
most 

disappointing 
about 
this 
is 

that, for the too-brief scenes 
set in Mid-World, “The Dark 
Tower” is actually quite a bit of 
fun. As Roland, Elba provides a 
presence that is perhaps never as 
commanding as it should be, but 
still embodies the stoic, tragic 
essence of the character that 
makes him so interesting.

Big House program supports diverse applicants

By DYLAN LACROIX

Summer Daily News Editor 

About 30 prospective minority 

undergraduate students gathered at 
Assembly Hall in Rackham Monday 
afternoon to meet with current 
University of Michigan students 

and administrative members to 
explore the advantages of choosing 
to study at the University for their 
undergraduate career.

The luncheon was one of a series 

of events held by the Big House 
Program, which throughout the 
summer and academic year supports 
chosen underrepresented minority 

prospective students throughout the 
process of applying to the University. 
The program started in 2012.

Compared to the 26.5 percent 

acceptance rate for the University 
overall 
for 
fall 
2017, 
program 

participants 
yielded 
an 
overall 

acceptance rate of 82 percent, with 27 
out of 33 participants accepted to the 

University.

Reem 
Aburukba, 
Dearborn 

resident and Big House Program 
participant, said many who are 
often left in the dark when applying 
to college. The Big House Program 
seeks to amend this, she explained, 
by providing valuable resources to 
prospective students. This helped 
alleviate many of her concerns and 
fears around the college application 
process.

“When you’re searching things 

up online, they make it seem really 

impossible to get a really good 
personal essay,” Aburukba said. 
“But here they’re alleviating our 
fears and telling us like, ‘You need to 
expose enough of yourself to show 
them you’ve been through things 
and that you’re ready for Michigan 
and just want to make a change.’ It’s 
a difference; it gives you ideas.”

LSA junior Antonio Gallegos, 

who went through the program 
three years ago, spoke on how, 
with the mentorship offered by the 
program, his dream of attending 
the University became a reality.

“I don’t think I’d be where I 

am today without the program,” 
Gallegos said. “I didn’t even really 
think Michigan was a possibility for 
me. I’m a first generation student so 
I didn’t know anything.”

He 
shared 
how, 
once 
the 

application process was over and 
he had received admission, the 
program continued to guide him 
throughout his college transition 
period.

“The Big House really gave me 

the resources necessary to apply 
and not only apply, but once I 
came here even at my orientation 
people within PILOT, the student 

organization, were reaching out to 
me,” he said.

Throughout the summer and 

academic year, members of PILOT, 
a 
student-based 
organization 

working towards fostering diverse 
leadership within the University 
community, mentor and guide 
the chosen prospective students 
throughout the application process 
with the Big House Program.

University Regent Shauna Diggs 

gave a brief speech at the event, 
attributing 
her 
own 
personal 

success to an experience similar to 
the Big House Program when she 
applied to college.

“I went to quite a few programs 

like this, and they are in large part 
the reason I am a physician in 
private practice today, a regent at the 
University of Michigan,” Diggs said.

She went on to describe the large 

amount of opportunities that the 
University has to offer that are not 
possible at other institutions.

“There are a couple things that 

a program like this can do,” Diggs 
said. “The first is to present to you 
all the opportunities, to see the 
possibilities. Sometimes in our small 
world we can’t really see all the 
things that we can do, but when you 
come to a place like the University 
of Michigan, campus of Ann Arbor, 
Dearborn and Flint, you can really 
start to see all the things that you 
can accomplish.”

Later 
this 
year, 
program 

participants will return to campus in 
the fall to shadow current University 
students and explore academic 
options, and again in 2018 to plan 
their 
collegiate 
transition 
and 

connect with University support 
services.

Brown and 
white and 

never enough

By ELISE JAYAKAR

Michgian In Color 

Contributor 

I grew up hiding behind my 

mom’s light, long legs at grocery 
stores, burying my head into the 
cart-made skid marks and hoping 
no one pointed at the spectrum 
that lay between our skin. Meijer 
was terrifying. I worried that my 
big-hearted mother would again be 
labeled my “nanny” by some lady 
juggling a box of Cheez-Its and 
toilet paper. Even today, I can still 
feel the sting of the word “nanny” 
branded onto my mother’s heart, in 
the same way that it did mine.

As I grew older, I learned to 

manage. I maneuvered my way 
through the fruits and vegetables 
aisle without shame. I let my sassy 
first-grade confidence lead me. 
No one dared to hurt me again. I 
thought my poise and our matching 
bouncy laughs would discourage 
strangers from dividing us because 
my mother and I have the same 
cheeks, smile and heart. We speak 
the same language of love above all 
else. She taught me how to make 
lasagna and friends, and to love 
your family before yourself.

But Meijer became my enemy 

again when I was in middle school. 
The day that I became afraid of my 
best friends coming along to the 
grocery store was the same day I 
lost hope in strangers. Once again, 
I began to doubt intentions and 
replaced admiration with jealousy. 
My best friend’s skin tone always 

matched the same porcelain color 
of my mother’s, and another ordi-
nary shopper would tell my mother 
that “her daughter” is beautiful or 
how they look so much alike during 
checkout. They were never talking 
about me and my brown skin. So 
I stood at the empty cart, empty-
hearted and betrayed by the soft 
“thank you” my mother returned. 
I wondered why I was so easily 
forgotten. I wondered when race 
became the thing that could so easy 
divide us as family.

The divide split deeper. I 

noticed how “being tan” was only 
beautiful if you were olive after 
a thick hot sun. I noticed how 
bushy eyebrows meant nerdy, 
dirty, unkempt. How white boys 
never liked brown girls. I noticed 
that my body would never be 
lusted over with its dark skin 
and round features. My crooked 
middle school smile broke when 
I was 12 and a boy made fun of 
the dark hair on my legs. A hairy 
Indian could never be desirable 
and half white only counts when 
you have green eyes and porce-
lain light skin. My prepubescent 
mind didn’t understand much, 
but it knew that Lizzie McGuire 
was what was beautiful: blond 
hair and striking blue eyes. Those 
eyes, the blond hair and the hair-
less legs were the same eyes, hair 
and legs of all the friends around 
me. I have dark, tangled hair. My 
left eye is brown while my right 
is almost black, and my knees and 
elbows are chalky.

The same question of race 

becoming the thing that so easily 
divided us crossed my mind when 
I was 17 and applying to colleges. 
You see, they have added new 
boxes for race like “Asian/Pacific 

Islander,” “Native American” and 
“Other,” but I cannot squeeze so 
easily into any of the demograph-
ics listed. I cannot simply click one. 
I was never South Asian enough 
to press down on “Asian/Pacific 
Islander.” My whiteness doesn’t 
show in my skin; only in the way I 
learned how to cook and celebrate 
birthdays. And why should I press 
down on the “other” button when 
strangers at the grocery store do 
that for me anyway?

Again, 
the 
same 
question 

recurred, stripping me down to 
only bone. A prickly-bearded boy 
walked up to me in the basement 
of some bar just to ask me where 
I came from. I politely responded 
with Sri Lanka and India in my soul 
and United States soil as my home. 
The boy smirked, his lips tightened. 
“Sri Lanka is just another part of 
India,” he announced selfishly. 
“You’re American.” Lately, I’ve been 
learning how to stand up for myself, 
to be more than docile and submis-
sive. Tell me why I always have to 
prove where I am from. Tell me why 
my words are never enough.

Again, last summer, my plump 

professor bellowed, “So, are you 
Hindu or Muslim?” I told him I 
am Christian, my family is Chris-
tian, but he couldn’t comprehend 
how such tanned skin could be so 
“American.” Christianity is usually 
synonymous with white. But my 
whiteness is not what embodies my 
religious beliefs. My grandfather 
— a balding Indian man with thick 
skin and a love for spice so sizzling 
it burns your mouth — is the most 
devout Christian I know.

The Asians 

who didn’t 

turn out 

right

I sip from a teacup at the din-

ner table, half listening to my 
family’s 
ear-splitting 
conver-

sations — which, in our world, 
means light chitchat. My uncle 
and aunt are talking stocks. One 
cousin is showing us his dancing 
skills by flipping his sister over. 
My grandmother is putting salted 
fish down. On one end of the table, 
my older cousin has been roped 
into a conversation about a start-
up with my father.

“— and so you could help me 

design the software for the A-P-
P,” he says, pushing a laptop 
towards my cousin. He looks over 
at the screen.

“I mean, I guess, yeah.”
“It’s all about artificial intel-

ligence. That’s the hot industry 
right now, so many job opportuni-
ties!” My father looks pointedly at 
me.

“Uh, I’m a Communications 

major.” I shift my teacup between 
my hands.

“But communication is still 

important. A.I. is all about com-
munication!”

“Well, the major looks more at 

media —”

“Man to machine! Communi-

cating!”

My uncle looks over. “I thought 

you wanted to do business?”

“Um, I didn’t get into the pro-

gram.” My foot drums nervously 
on the floor. Truth be told, I real-
ized halfway through the year 
that I would probably hate myself 
if I ended up in a corporation sell-
ing a good I didn’t care about.

“Well, that’s okay. You can 

transfer 
to 
engineering,” 
he 

shrugs. I refrain from mentioning 
that I failed high school quantum 
mechanics.

A few days later I tell my fam-

ily that I want to work in media 
diversity, maybe through social 
media or brand management. Try 

and teach at a university later. I 
am met with a pause.

“That’s not easy,” my father 

says slowly.

“Nothing’s easy,” I retort.
My aunt bursts out laughing. 

“That’s true. I like that.”

Shame is rooted in the com-

parison between yourself and 
social standards. My cousin hosts 
a Brooklyn comedy show by that 
very name: Shame with Yang and 
Blane (free most Wednesdays in 
Brooklyn, New York). The older 
generation is not very aware of 
the side hustle, because he has a 
“real job” as an engineer. Maybe 
the irony is intentional.

Shame and I, however, are on 

intimate terms, a bubbling in the 
back of my throat I can immedi-
ately associate with my family. 
To me, it’s always been clear that 
there is a right way to live, by my 
community’s standards. Go into a 
STEM field (even law was tabooed 
by my parents), keep a healthy 
savings account, raise kids, stay 
out of liberal arts. Combined with 
the throttling pressure of acting 
as society’s model minority, being 
a social justice-loving, article-
writing loudmouth has set me up 
to feel like the worst-kept secret 
of our new American lineage. 
Even my mother, who had the gall 
to get divorced and talks openly 
about politics, resists my career 
path. I know they are afraid I will 
not reap the rewards they sought 
for me when they immigrated to 
this country. I know I will prob-
ably never be able to pay them 
back, for all they have given me.

But I also wish someone had 

told me earlier that my fam-
ily hoped for my happiness. And 
to fulfill that, you must do it on 
your own terms. My cousins, who 
write and perform in secret. Girls 
at Chinese school who want to 
be dancers, diplomats, linguists. 
Kids who don’t have the top stan-
dardized test scores and go to 
mid-tier schools, when we are 
expected to outperform everyone 
else. There are so many Asians 
who didn’t turn out right.

It is a monumental effort to 

go your own way. To reject your 
parents’ wishes, to brush aside 
their sacrifices. There are many 
reasons why a path cannot be 
feasible. But shame is not a rea-
son to live someone else’s life in 
the hopes it will one day become 
yours. It’s not an easy decision.

But nothing is easy.

Michigan announces hiring 
of Fetter as new pitching 

Democratic primary yields 
new balance on City Council

Before last season, Mike 

McCray had recorded just two 
tackles in his college career 
and had never started a game 
for the Michigan football 
team.

McCray, a former four-star 

recruit out of high school, 
had always shown promise 
— a blocked punt in a victory 
over Appalachian State in 
2014 had displayed as much. 
But McCray couldn’t stay on 
the field — health problems, 
including a shoulder injury 
that sidelined him for the 
entire 2015 season, derailed 
his first three years in a 
Wolverine uniform.

With the graduation of 

three 
senior 
linebackers 

— Joe Bolden, Desmond 
Morgan and James Ross — 
a healthy McCray finally 
got his chance last year 
and ran with it. He made 
an immediate impact in his 
first start, a season-opening 
victory over Hawaii where he 
made nine tackles, 3.5 for loss 
and two sacks, to kick-start 
an All-Big Ten Honorable 
Mention campaign in which 
he totalled 76 stops, including 
12.5 for a loss as well as 4.5 
sacks and two interceptions.

One year later, the fifth-

year senior linebacker is 
the only returning starter 
from the previous season’s 
dominant defense. But that’s 
not the only thing different 
about 
McCray, 
according 

to linebackers coach Chris 
Partridge.

“There’s an aura about him 

that’s different than it was 
last year and that’s important 
because guys will look up to 
him,” Partridge said. “He’s a 
hard worker and he’s tough, 
he’s a Big Ten linebacker. Now 
with that aura about him and 
that sense of leadership he’s 
stepped his game up.”

To Partridge, McCray has 

carried himself in a different 
manner so far in fall camp 
— a manner that is essential. 
The 
omnipresent 
theme 

for Michigan — young and 
talented, but inexperienced 

— applies to its linebacking 
corps as much as anywhere, 
and McCray has asserted 
himself 
as 
a 
necessary 

veteran voice for that group.

“Last year he was kind of 

feeling it out early, started 
gaining 
confidence 
and 

became a tremendous football 
player for us,” Partridge said. 
“This year he’s coming in 
having that background and 
he’s able to impose himself 
on the other guys and on the 
young guys.”

The impact of McCray’s 

new role as an elder statesmen 
was visible even in the spring. 
Sophomore Devin Bush Jr. 
was immediately slotted in 
as McCray’s backup at the 
WILL linebacker position 
last season, and made a big 
impact in the Wolverines’ 
spring game, tallying two 
sacks.

So far during camp, Bush 

has mostly played at the 
MIKE position vacated by 
Ben Gedeon from last season, 
and after a year learning the 
ropes from veterans such as 
McCray, he appears primed 
for a breakout in the middle 
of Michigan’s defense with 
his increased maturity and 
physical development.

“Athletically, he’s a guy 

who works just as hard 
off the field as on the field, 
really enjoys the game and 
all aspects of it,” Partridge 
said. “His ceiling’s high and 
he keeps getting better and 
better. 
Obviously 
a 
very 

savvy football player from his 
background from his father 
playing and everything like 
that, so we’re excited about 
what he’s going to be able to 
do.” 

Perhaps the biggest hole 

in the Wolverines’ linebacker 
unit, however, comes at 
the VIPER position once 
home to the do-everything 
Jabrill Peppers. While the 
competition 
to 
win 
the 

starting job is far from over, 
sophomore Khaleke Hudson 
appeared to have the upper 
hand after an impressive 
spring.

“(He’s a) guy that just 

loves 
contact,” 
Partridge 

said. “People feed off of that 

too. He’s becoming very 
well-rounded as a player, so 
he’s going to be enjoyable to 
watch.”

Hudson might be the 

most natural replacement 
for Peppers on Michigan’s 
roster — in fact, both were 
recruited as defensive backs 
before 
switching 
to 
the 

hybrid 
linebacker-safety 

position. Described as a 
“hammerhead” by Partridge, 
Hudson’s 
athleticism 

and explosiveness should 
provide a key dimension for 
the Wolverines and emulate 
to some extent what Peppers 
was able to bring last season, 
as he works to become a 
more skilled player instead of 
relying solely on aggression.

“You’re never going to tell 

Coach Brown that you don’t 
want someone to run full 
speed into things,” Partridge 
said. “That’s a small part of 
it, but he’s gonna round out 
his game just like anyone 
always would. Coach Brown 
will never say take away 
that physicality, but you 
learn how to play with that 
physicality.”

With the leadership of 

upperclassmen 
such 
as 

McCray and senior Michael 
Wroblewski, as well as the 
talent of younger players like 
Bush, Hudson and freshmen 
Drew Singleton and Jordan 
Anthony, 
Michigan’s 

linebacking corps has been 
touted by some as its best 
defensive unit. But Partridge 
stated that the pressure on 
the group to live up to those 
expectations will be key for 
them to fulfill that promise.

“There’s 
pressure 
at 

all 
moments 
and 
that’s 

something you have to learn 
how to deal with. You gotta 
just put your head down and 
keep working,” Partridge 
said. “I tell these guys all the 
time, ‘You want to be tough, 
do tough things.’ Pressure 
is a part of being tough and 
camp is a part of being tough 
and fighting through things 
and working together. We’ll 
take on all comers, anything 
that will make us tougher 
and make us a better unit is 
something we embrace.”

Ann Arbor residents voted 

Tuesday in the Democratic 
primary election for City 
Council.

In Ward 1, challenger 

Anne 
Bannister 
defeated 

incumbent 
Jason 
Frenzel 

with 944 votes to Frenzel’s 
829. Bannister was the only 
challenger to win on Tuesday 
— in Ward 3, Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman 
won 

with 1,283 votes to opponent 
Stephen Kunselman’s 1,098. 
In Ward 4, Councilmember 
Jack Eaton won with 1,256 
votes to opponent Jaime 
Magiera’s 963, and in Ward 
5, 
Councilmember 
Chip 

Smith won with 1,948 votes to 
opponent David Silkworth’s 
1,749.

Though 
the 
city 
is 

divided into five electoral 
wards — each of which has 
two representatives on the 
council who alternate election 
years — there were only four 
contests in this primary, as 
Jared Hoffert (D–Ward 2) 
ran unopposed, but will face 
incumbent 
Councilmember 

Jane Lumm (I–Ward 2) in the 
general election in November.

This will be the last City 

Council election held in an 
odd year. Residents voted last 
November to extend council 
member’s terms from two 
to four years, but the council 
members elected in this cycle 
will serve three year terms, 
making their next election 
year even.

The 
election 
was 
in 

many ways a referendum 

on the city’s position on 
development. Many residents 
were upset in April when the 
council voted 8-3 to sell the 
publicly-owned Library Lot 
to Chicago-based developer 
Core Spaces, unhappy with 
what a new skyscraper would 
mean for Ann Arbor.

The three council members 

that voted against the sale 
of the Library Lot — Lumm, 
Eaton and Kailasapathy — 
have also opposed the other 
eight members of the council, 
including 
Mayor 
Chris 

Taylor, on a number of issues 
regarding development and 
taxes. Those three will gain 
a fourth in Bannister, who 
ran her campaign against 
Frenzel’s Library Lot vote.

“I think that with my 

personal finance and my 
financial 
planning 
background 

and fiscal responsibility and 
conservation of resources, 
I think that resonates with 
people because we pay a lot 
of property taxes here in 
town,” Bannister said. “It was 
also important that now we 
have the 7-4 ratio. Knocking 
on doors, that was really 
important to voters, even if 
they were ambivalent about 
development issues, the idea 
of more debate on council was 
important to them.”

The shift from the de facto 

8-3 to 7-4 balance is significant 
— though passage of any law 
or resolution requires a six-
vote majority and mayoral 
approval, eight is the number 
of votes required to override a 
mayoral veto, create a new city 
office, take private property 
for a public use or transfer any 

unencumbered budget funds 
from one operating fund to 
another.

Though she said she had 

not 
heard 
from 
Frenzel 

or the mayor’s office as of 
Wednesday night, Bannister 
said she hoped to do away 
with any ill will the campaign 
had dredged up and focus 
on working together and 
governing effectively with her 
colleagues.

Ackerman, who spoke with 

his opponent Kunselman once 
the election results were out, 
said they exchanged their 
mutual respect and shared 
Bannister’s opinion on moving 
forward.

“Two years ago I ran on an 

approach for representation 
that first takes guidance and 
solicits guidance from the 
community, but also strives to 
work together with colleagues 
and staff to find solutions 
to that community input,” 
Ackerman said. “I think, over 
the course of the last two 
years, we’ve worked very 
hard and very well together 
to get a lot of things done, and 
a lot of things done that have 
been approved unanimously. 
I think if we continue that 
and if we continue to work 
in an environment of mutual 
respect and dignity, I think 
we’re gonna be in good shape.”

He 
stood 
by 
his 

endorsement of Bannister’s 
opponent, however, saying the 
community lost an incredible 
resource in Jason Frenzel’s 
electoral loss.

Breaking down the men’s soccer roster 

Despite a dismal 4-11-4 record, 

it wouldn’t be entirely accurate 
to call the Michigan men’s soccer 
team’s 2016 season a complete 
disappointment. 
Teams 
that 

rely on underclassmen as four 
of their top five playmakers, as 
the Wolverines did last season, 
tend to experience growing 
pains. That was certainly true 
for Michigan, as the Wolverines 
scored just 22 goals in 19 
matches last season and shot 
.081 compared to .102 for their 
opponents.

However, Michigan showed 

flashes 
at 
times, 
especially 

towards the end of the season 
— in their last four matches, 
the Wolverines averaged 2.75 
goals, defeated No. 9 Rutgers 
and battled No. 1 Maryland to 
two 
double-overtime 
losses. 

Meanwhile, coach Chaka Daley 
was able to land the No. 8 
recruiting class in the country 
according to TopDrawerSoccer.
com — a class that includes 
midfielder Umar Farouk Osman, 
the Gatorade National Player of 
the Year.

With Michigan kicking off 

preseason training Wednesday, 
and its first exhibition game 
against Wisconsin-Green Bay 10 
days away, the Daily previews 
the Wolverines’ 2017 roster.

Goalkeepers
Replacing Evan Louro will 

undoubtedly 
be 
Michigan’s 

biggest task going into the 
season. Louro, who tallied 68 
saves as a junior, was a rock 
in goal for the Wolverines 
throughout his career, making 
44 starts in three seasons and 
finishing 
with 
the 
second-

best 
goals-allowed-per-game 

average in program history. His 
decision to sign with MLS’s New 
York Red Bulls leaves a hole that 
won’t be filled easily.

Andrew Verdi, who redshirted 

as a freshman last season, could 
get the first shot at doing so. 
Verdi and Louro share a number 
of similarities: Both were part of 
MLS youth academies — Louro 
with the Red Bulls and Verdi 
with the Philadelphia Union — 
and both have national team 
experience — Louro competed 
with the United States U20 
National 
Team 
while 
Verdi 

was a member of the U.S. U18 

squad. While Verdi is short on 
experience, his talent could 
propel him into an immediate 
starting role.

The Wolverines have three 

other 
goalkeepers 
on 
their 

roster. Fifth-year senior Grant 
Mattia was the third-stringer 
last season, playing in one 
contest after not appearing in 
either of the last two seasons. 
Michigan 
also 
adds 
two 

freshmen netminders: Weston, 
Fla. product Henry Mashburn 
and 
Michigan 
native 
Jacob 

Nunner.

Defenders
The Wolverines are losing 

three 
defenders 
from 
last 

season: Lars Eckenrode, Andre 
Morris and Rylee Woods, who 
were three of Michigan’s top 
four 
defenders 
in 
minutes 

played 
last 
season. 
Morris 

and 
Eckenrode 
provided 

experience and leadership at 
centerback, 
while 
Michigan 

will miss Woods’ versatility and 
playmaking ability on the flank, 
where he tallied a team-leading 
six assists last season.

Left and right back should 

be in strong hands with junior 
Marcello Borges and senior Billy 
Stevens, respectively. Borges, 
who moved from left wing to the 
back four midway through the 
season, tied for third in assists 
with three, while Stevens has 
started 53 games over the last 
three seasons. 

Peter Brown, who started 11 

games last year, is likely to fill 
one of the vacancies at central 
defender. Other candidates to 
see time include sophomore 
Abdou Samake and junior Daniel 
Mukuna, who should provide 
good 
size 
and 
physicality. 

Mukuna, a mid-year transfer 
from Campbell, was named to 
the All-Big South Second Team 
as a sophomore.

The Wolverines add three 

freshmen to the mix in Nash 
Pirie (Barrington, Ill.), Joel 
Harrison (Langley, B.C.) and 
Jackson Ragen (Seattle, Wash.). 
Versatility is a hallmark of 
the group — Ragen, a skilled 
passer according to Daley, can 
play both centerback and the 
No. 6 midfield position, as can 
Harrison. Pirie has a reputation 
as 
an 
athletic, 
dangerous 

attacker at fullback.

Midfielders
Michigan 
comes 
into 
the 

season 
with 
a 
wealth 
of 

midfielders, 12 in all. Central 
midfielder Tyler Anderson and 
Brett Nason, the Wolverines’ 
main holding midfielder, are the 
main losses in this group.

Michigan will look for strong 

production from Ivo Cerda, 
who was named a team captain 
this season. The junior central 
midfielder scored two goals and 
added two assists last season, 
tying for fifth on the team in 
points scored.

Junior 
Robbie 
Mertz 

appeared 
to 
find 
a 
home 

as 
a 
playmaking, 
attacking 

midfielder last season. Mertz 
provided four goals and chipped 
in three assists as a sophomore, 
and will be responsible for 
connecting 
the 
Wolverines’ 

forwards, 
keeping 
them 

engaged and providing them 
with scoring opportunities.

Michigan’s recruiting class 

includes Austin Swietch, who 
Daley has described as being 
able to play holding midfield 
and attacking midfield equally 
effectively, 
Carlos 
Tellez, 

a 
hard-working 
central 

midfielder, and Marc Ybarra, 
who 
Daley 
believes 
could 

become a “top-class holding 
midfielder.” Osman, however, is 
the biggest name of the group, 
and with good reason.

As a senior in high school, 

Osman contributed to 28 of 
his team’s 30 goals, scoring 
63 goals and adding 45 assists 
in 
all. 
Osman 
joins 
fellow 

Ghanaians Francis Atuahene and 
Mohammed Zakyi on Michigan’s 
roster, and will once again team 
up with Atuahene after they 
played together at the Hotchkiss 
School in Connecticut. Despite 
his youth, his speed, skill and 
versatility should allow him 
to 
contribute 
anywhere 
and 

possibly have the game-changing 
impact 
Atuahene 
had 
as 
a 

freshman.

Forwards
The names to know here are 

Atuahene and sophomore Jack 
Hallahan, who were first and 
second, 
respectively, 
in 
goals 

for the Wolverines last season. 
Hallahan, a member of Ireland’s 
U18 and U19 national teams, 
impacted games last season with 
his pace and skill on the wing.

and talented, but inexperi-

enced — applies to its linebacking 
corps as much as anywhere, and 
McCray has asserted himself as a 
necessary veteran voice for that 
group.

“Last year he was kind of feel-

ing it out early, started gain-
ing confidence and became a 
tremendous football player for 
us,” Partridge said. “This year 
he’s coming in having that back-
ground and he’s able to impose 
himself on the other guys and on 
the young guys.”

The impact of McCray’s new 

role as an elder statesmen was 
visible even in the spring. Sopho-
more Devin Bush Jr. was imme-
diately slotted in as McCray’s 
backup at the WILL linebacker 
position last season, and made 
a big impact in the Wolverines’ 
spring game, tallying two sacks.

So far during camp, Bush has 

mostly played at the MIKE posi-
tion vacated by Ben Gedeon from 
last season, and after a year learn-
ing the ropes from veterans such 
as McCray, he appears primed for 
a breakout in the middle of Mich-
igan’s defense with his increased 
maturity and physical develop-
ment.

“Athletically, he’s a guy who 

works just as hard off the field 
as on the field, really enjoys the 
game and all aspects of it,” Par-
tridge said. “His ceiling’s high 
and he keeps getting better and 
better. Obviously a very savvy 
football player from his back-
ground from his father playing 

and everything like that, so we’re 
excited about what he’s going to 
be able to do.” 

Perhaps the biggest hole in 

the Wolverines’ linebacker unit, 
however, comes at the VIPER 
position once home to the do-
everything 
Jabrill 
Peppers. 

While the competition to win the 
starting job is far from over, soph-
omore Khaleke Hudson appeared 
to have the upper hand after an 
impressive spring.

“(He’s a) guy that just loves 

contact,” Partridge said. “People 
feed off of that too. He’s becom-
ing very well-rounded as a player, 
so he’s going to be enjoyable to 
watch.”

Hudson might be the most 

natural replacement for Peppers 
on Michigan’s roster — in fact, 
both were recruited as defensive 
backs before switching to the 
hybrid linebacker-safety position. 
Described as a “hammerhead” by 
Partridge, Hudson’s athleticism 
and explosiveness should provide 
a key dimension for the Wolver-
ines and emulate to some extent 
what Peppers was able to bring 
last season, as he works to become 
a more skilled player instead of 
relying solely on aggression.

“You’re never going to tell 

Coach Brown that you don’t want 
someone to run full speed into 
things,” Partridge said. “That’s 
a small part of it, but he’s gonna 
round out his game just like any-
one always would. Coach Brown 
will never say take away that phys-
icality, but you learn how to play 
with that physicality.”

Wolverines’ forwards is that of 
Yamann Salool, who scored three 
goals last season and was their 
top goal-scoring threat off the 
bench. Finding someone to give 
Atuahene a breather on occasion 
will be key. Zakyi, a product of 
Manchester City’s Academy and 
the Ghana U17 National Team 
who scored 60 goals his last 
two seasons for the Canterbury 
School in Connecticut, and junior 
Johann Bittner, who appeared 
in six games last season, are two

Tyree Kinnel looks to take on a leadership role in Michigan’s secondary this season.

Kinnel looks to take on leadership 
role in inexperienced secondary

The 
adjectives 
“young”, 

“talented” and “inexperienced” 
effectively 
describe 
every 

position group on the Michigan 
football team.

However, they are perhaps 

most 
applicable 
to 
the 

Wolverines’ secondary. While 
the defensive line returns four 
players who saw significant 
playing 
time 
last 
season, 

including two Bednarik Award 
candidates in Maurice Hurst 
and Rashan Gary, and fifth-
year senior Mike McCray — an 
All-Big Ten Honorable mention 
honoree — will anchor the 
linebacking corps, not a single 
one of Michigan’s defensive 
backs have even started a game.

Gone 
is 
First-Team 
All-

American 
Jourdan 
Lewis. 

Gone are All-Big Ten honorees 
Channing Stribling, Delano Hill 
and Dymonte Thomas. Gone is 
Jeremy Clark, who was denied 
a sixth year of eligibility after 
a knee injury ended his final 
season.

“If people will say that it’s 

because we did lose a lot, it’s 
obvious,” said junior safety 
Tyree Kinnel after practice 
Tuesday. “But the talent’s still 
there, the system’s still there.”

Kinnel received substantial 

playing time last season on both 
defense and special teams last 
season, playing in all 13 games 
and recording 17 tackles and 
a forced fumble. He’s likely 
to start at free safety this 
season, and along with another 
relative 
veteran 
— 
redshirt 

junior 
cornerback 
Brandon 

Watson — he has been thrust 
into a leadership role almost 
by default. But according to 
special teams coordinator Chris 
Partridge, Kinnel is more than 
capable of stepping into those 
shoes, both on and off the field.

“Tyree is a leader. Natural 

leader,” Partridge said. “He gets 
those guys going, another guy 
that loves the game and loves all 
aspects of it.”

For 
Kinnel, 
the 
most 

important aspects of his new role 
are trust and communication. 
At safety, Kinnel will be tasked 
with anchoring the back of 

the defense and making sure 
the defense is lined up in their 
proper positions. But he feels 
confident 
and 
comfortable 

with 
these 
responsibilities, 

especially 
because 
while 

much of the leadership of the 
secondary 
may 
fall 
on 
his 

shoulders, Kinnel knows he 
won’t have to do it alone. He has 
already seen a wealth of other 
players contribute.

“Being one of the older guys 

there, I feel like I do need to 
take 
that 
leadership 
role,” 

Kinnel said. “I feel like I’ve 
done a good job this camp, as 
well as Josh Metellus, he’s been 
taking 
leadership, 
Brandon 

Watson and Keith Washington 
too. 
I 
don’t 

think 
it’s 
just 

one of us that’s 
leading. 
We’re 

all 
together, 

we’re 
all 

communicating 
together, you can 
tell 
everyone’s 

talking, 
even 

the 
freshman. 

We 
all 
feel 

good 
together, 

trusting 
each 
other 
and 

communicating.”

Watson, who appeared in all 

13 games last year and recorded 
13 tackles, and Washington, a 
redshirt sophomore who had an 
impressive showing in spring 
camp, are both in the running 
to start at cornerback. Metellus, 
meanwhile, started the Orange 
Bowl at the VIPER position 
in place of Jabrill Peppers but 
moved back to the secondary, 
where he played alongside and 
developed a strong connection 
with Kinnel in last season and 
this spring’s practices.

“He’s 
doing 
really 
well,” 

Kinnel said of Metellus. “We 
trust each other and that’s the 
key. 
We 
communicate 
back 

there and just trust each other.”

Kinnel 
also 
pointed 
to 

sophomore cornerbacks David 
Long and Lavert Hill, both of 
whom saw action as freshmen, as 
players that have improved and 
benefited from their experience 
last season in maturing behind 
an 
experienced 
and 
skilled 

stable of defensive backs.

“You can tell especially the 

guys that came in in the spring, 
some of the guys that came in 
the games last year,” Kinnel 
said. “You can tell that the game 
started moving just a little bit 
slow for us. We’re just trying to 
take every rep as it can, mental 
reps, physical reps and get 
better every day.”

Kinnel’s comfort with his 

enlarged role is also increased 
due to having a second offseason 
and camp with Don Brown as 
defensive coordinator.

“I had two springs with 

Coach Brown, this is my second 
camp with him,” Kinnel said. 
“It’s great and I feel really 
comfortable. I’m good with my 
plans, just trying to help the 

other guys.”

Having 

comfort 
in 

Brown’s 
scheme 

has also helped 
freshmen such as 
safeties J’Marick 
Woods 
and 

Jaylen 
Kelly-

Powell, who both 
enrolled 
early 

at Michigan and 
participated with 

the team in the spring.

“They’re getting even better, 

which is a really good thing,” 
Kinnel said. “You can tell that 
they came in the spring, it was 
a good thing they came in the 
spring because now they came 
in knowing the plays, knowing 
what they have to do, so now 
they’re playing much faster in 
Coach Brown’s system.”

While Kinnel recognizes how 

much talent and experience 
the 
Wolverines 
lost 
from 

last season, the schemes and 
gameplans behind the nation’s 
No. 1 pass defense are solidly 
in place. Now it’s up to Kinnel, 
Watson, Metellus and anyone 
else who might step up to ensure 
the networks of trust between 
the 
defensive 
backs 
remain 

strong as well. And in Kinnel’s 
view, it’s off to a solid start.

“We’re all hungry and you 

can tell watching the film every 
day 
at 
practice 
everybody’s 

going hard,” Kinnel said. “No 
lows. High expectations, as 
Coach 
Brown 
always 
says. 

Competition brings out the best 
in all of us, we’re competing.”
