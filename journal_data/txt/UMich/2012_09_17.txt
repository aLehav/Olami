CITY GOVERNMENT
Millage
may fund
new forms
of local art

Bihg score doesn't mean much

Proposal would
provide money to
peformance art
programs
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
Every April Fool's Day, giant
papier-mache puppets parade
down Main Street as part of Fes-
tifools, the annual festival that
unites University artists and
Ann Arbor residents. Though
the program currently receives
support from a number of small
donors, it may be eligible for city
funding if a new arts millage
passes this fall.
The public art millage on the
ballot for November aims to
restructure the funding model for
public art in Ann Arbor. Public art
administrator Aaron Seagraves
said if the millage is passed, it
would eliminate strict restric-
tions and open funding to tempo-
rary work and performance art,
including Festifools.
The millage would also take
the place of Percent for Art, the

current program that yields 1
percent of city-sponsored con-
struction project funding into a
permanent art display.
Seagraves said Percent for Art
requires public art installations to
be constructed on all citygovern-
ment developments in relation to
the purpose of the department.
"Because the Percent for Art
program was attached to those
specific projects, those projects
have particular funding sources,"
Seagraves said. "So, in turn, the
public art project that develops
from the funding has to relate
to the purpose of the funding
source, so it's kind of a complex
scheme."
For example, the water-
themed sculpture in front of Ann
Arbor's Municipal Center was
funded by the Water andSewage
Department, Seagraves said.
Rather than taking funding
from specific departments, Sea-
graves said the newly-proposed
funding will come directly from
a tax that would last three years,
bringing in $459,273 each year
and costing households about
$11 annually.

enard Robinson looked
across the field, scan-
ning the sea of maroon
and white jerseys heading up
the Michigan Stadium tunnel.
Robinson took off on a jog. He
had somebody to track down.
Robinson caught up to
Michael Cox, the starting Mas-
sachusetts running back, at the
30-yard line and they greeted
each other like brothers; their
elaborate handshake included
a few windmill gestures and
ended with a bear hug. Roy
Roundtree followed right
behind, a grin splashed across

his face as he hugged Cox - his
classmate and teammate for
four years at Michigan.

of Massa- STEPHEN J.
chusetts on NESBITT
Saturday.
Robinson and Roundtree
finally parted ways with Cox

and raced to the north end
zone to sing "The Victors" with
the student section.
Cox turned the other way,
smiling all the while. None of
his teammates were left on the
field. He shook hands with a
pair of Michigan coaches, the
ones that were on his sideline
just nine months ago, and
started up the tunnel.
Everything was off-kilter for
Cox. He felt like he'd taken a
wrong turn or two in his final
visit to the Big House. He was
in the wrong locker room, on
the wrong sideline and on the

wrong end of a blowout.
But as he took his first step
up the runway, maize-clad fans
reached down for a high-five.
Maybe they remembered him,
maybe'not. Codxobliged; slap-
ping hands as the darkness of
the tunnel quickly enveloped
him for the final time in his
career.
Just like that, the man
whose return to Ann Arbor
made something of a game that
meant absolutely nothing was
gone.
And by nothing, I'm serious.

CENTRAL STUDENT GOVERNMENT
President of
CSG speaks out
against RSG's
secession plans

Parikh says divided
government is
threat to student
unity
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
After Rackham Student Gov-
ernment proposed seceding
from Central Student Govern-
ment last week - a move that
could result in the loss of more
than $200,000 in annual rev-
enue for the organization -
CSG members are speaking out
against the potential schism.
Manish Parikh, CSG presi-
dent and Business senior, said
CSG serves as one of few student
organizations that represents
both graduates and undergrad-
uates, and is an important rela-
tionship to maintain.
"It has been this way for a
reason, and it will be this way

for a reason," Parikh said.
He continued, arguing that
separate student governments
bodies would lessen the power
of the student.
"When our voice is together,
we have one singular unified
powerful voice," Parikh said.
"But if we split up into separate
factions ... our voice becomes
divided."
But RSG presidenthMichael
Benson has argued that CSG
and RSG have different inter-
ests and priorities.
According to Benson's pre-
liminary plan, the secession
would increase funding to the
student governments of the
individual schools and colleges,
and would fund a new unilat-
eral graduate student govern-
ment.
CSG would no longer collect
the $7.19 fee from every gradu-
ate student each semester, but
a similar fee would be split
between a graduate student's

With the addition ofthree new

The recent implementation
brings the total of hybrid buses
to seven - joining the four added

Bomb threat cleared at UT-Austin

The University of Texas at
Austin received a bomb threat
Friday morning that resulted
in the evacuation of all cam-

reported.
The university said in a state-
ment that the call came from
a man with a Middle Eastern

Qaeda. The caller said he had
placed bombs all around campus,
which would go off 90 minutes
after the phone call, according to
the statement.
The Daily Texan reported
that the university alerted stu-
dents to evacuate campus about
75 minutes later, and classes
were cancelled for the day. After

Obama to announce new case
on trade policy with China

Bodies of Afghan women are brought to a hospital in Alingar district of Laghman province of east of Kabul, Afghanistan
an Sunday.
Afghan insider attack
kills our Americans

President will
declare move at
campaign stop in
Ohio
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama will launch
a new trade enforcement case
against China Monday, usingthe
power of incumbency tocounter
Republican Mitt Romney's criti-
cism that he is ceding American
jobs to the Asian power.
Senior administration offi-
cials said the president will
announce the new case, tar-
geting Chinese subsidies for
exports of automobiles and
automobile parts, Monday dur-
ing a campaign trip to Ohio. The
swingstate has a large manufac-
turing base where many blame
China for depressing its indus-
try.
Obama and Romney have
both pushed China - and
through it, the economy - to the
forefront of the White House
race as they seek to refocus after
a week dominated by foreign
policy and the turbulent events
at U.S. embassies throughout
the Middle East.
Romney has accused Obama
of being weak on China to the
detriment of U.S. workers. The
president countered with claims
that Romney has investments
in Chinese companies and out-
sourced jobs to China while run-
ning the private equity firm Bain
Capital.
On Monday, with both candi-
dates returning to the campaign
trail after a weekend out of the
spotlight, Obama will try to gain
the upper hand in the debate.
Officials said the adminis-
tration will launch enforce-
ment action at the World Trade
Organization because it says
China is illegally subsidizing
exports in their autos and auto
parts sectors. The U.S. says the
practice puts American parts
manufacturers at a competitive
disadvantage and encourages
the outsourcing of production to
China.

The officials requested ano-
nymity because they were not
authorized to discuss the trade
action publicly ahead of the
president.
The administration is taking
the issue to the WTO because its
attempts to get China to address
the subsidies on its own have
been unsuccessful, the officials
said.
Jobs in the U.S. auto parts
sector dropped by roughly half
between 2001 and 2010, while
U.S. imports of auto parts from
China. have increased seven-
fold, according to the Obama

administration.
The administration is also
escalating another case it
brought against China at the
WTO in July that accuses China
of imposing unfair duties on
more than $3 billion in exports
of U.S. autos. The duties cover
more than 80 percent of Ameri-
can auto exports to China, said
the officials.
The cases stem from the
Interagency Trade Enforcement
Center Obama set up earlier this
year to target unfair practices
around the world, particularly
in China.

NATO airstrike
kills 8 local women
as U.S. withdraws
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
Afghan police killed four Ameri-
can soldiers coming to their aid
after a checkpoint attack Sunday,
the third assault by government
forces or insurgents disguised
in military uniforms in as many
days.
The escalating violence -
including a NATO airstrike that
killed eight Afghan women and
girls gathering firewood - is
straining the military partner-
ship between Kabul and NATO as
the U.S. begins to withdraw thou-
sands of troops sent three years
ago to route the Taliban from
southern strongholds.
The attacks drew unusually
strong criticism Sunday from
the U.S. military's top officer,
Army Gen. Martin Dempsey,
who called the problem of rogue
Afghan soldiers and police turn-
ing their guns on allied troops "a

very serious threat" to the war
effort.
This year, 51 international ser-
vice members have died at the
hands of their Afghan allies or
those who have infiltrated their
ranks. At least 12 such attacks
came in August alone, leaving 15
dead.
The surge in insider attacks is a
sign of how security has deterio-
rated as NATO prepares its mili-
tary exit from Afghanistan by the
end of 2014. The U.S. is days away
from completing the first stage of
its own drawdown, withdrawing
33,000 troops that were part of
a military surge three years ago.
The U.S. will remain with about
68,000 troops at the end of Sep-
tember.
NATO and U.S. forces are
working with the Afghan gov-
ernment to tighten vetting pro-
cedures and increase security
between the forces, but nothing
has so far been able to stem the
attacks on troops, which NATO
frequently asserts are standing
"shoulder by shoulder."
In unusually blunt remarks to

the Pentagon's own news service,
the American Forces Press Ser-
vice, Dempsey said the Afghan
government needs to take the
problem as seriously as do U.S.
commanders and officials.
"We're all seized with (the)
problem," said Dempsey, after
discussing the issue at a meet-
ing in Romania with NATO offi-
cials. "You can't whitewash it.
We can't convince ourselves that
we just have to work harder to
get through it. Something has to
change."
"We have to get on top of this.
It is a very serious threat to the
campaign."
A weekend of deadly attacks
began Friday night, when 15
insurgents disguised in U.S. army
uniforms killed two Marines,
wounded nine other people and
destroyed six Harrier fighter jets
at a major U.S. base in the south,
military officials said. On Satur-
day, agunman in the uniform of a
government-backed militia force
shot dead two British soldiers in
Helmand province in the south-
west.

agent pretending to be a terrorist
provided him with a phony car
bomb and watched him press the
trigger, prosecutors said.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in
Chicago, which announced the
arrest Saturday, said the device
was harmless and the public was
never at risk.
Daoud is charged with

Somalia appoints
new leader
Somalia's new leader was
inaugurated Sunday amid tight
security in the capital, Moga-
dishu, four days after President
Hassan Skeikh Mohamud sur-
vived an assassination attempt.
Mohamud, a teacher and
activist, won the election last
week against outgoing President
Sheik Sharif Sheikh Ahmed by
the legislative vote of 190 to 79.
The inauguration ceremony
was attended by some regional
leaders, including the prime
minister of Ethiopia and the
president of Djibouti.
The attempt on Mohamud's life
on his second day in office high-
lighted the serious security chal-
lenges he faces as he takes the helm
of a volatile country that has not
had a stable government for more
than two decades. Mohamud him-
self acknowledged this fact, saying
in his inauguration remarks that
security was the paramount issue.
He promised to be a democrat and
to create "an effective justice sys-
tem" that serves all Somalis.

Supporters of Pakistani religious party Jamaat-e-Islami cahnt slogans during a demonstration, in Karachi, Pakistan on
Friday as part of widespread anger across the Muslim world about a film ridiculing Islam's Prophet Muhammad.
Hezbollah urges protests against
U.S., clashes over prophet film

Demonstrations
held against U.S. in
light of anti-Islam
movie
KARACHI, Pakistan (AP)
- Hundreds of Pakistanis pro-
testing an anti-Islam film broke
through a barricade near the
U.S. Consulate in the southern
city of Karachi on Sunday, spark-
ing clashes with police in which
one demonstrator was killed and
more than a dozen injured.
In a move that could escalate
tensions around the Arab world,
the leader of the Hezbollah mil-
itant group called for protests
against the movie, saying pro-
testers should not only 'express
our anger' at U.S. embassies but
urge leaders to act.
The film, which denigrates
Islam's Prophet Muhammad,
has sparked violent protests
in many Muslim countries in
recent days, including one in
Libya in which the U.S. ambas-

sador was killed. The U.S. has
responded by deploying addi-
tional military forces to increase
security in certain hotspots.
In a televised speech, Hez-
bollah leader Sheik Hassan Nas-
rallah said the U.S. must be held
accountable for the film, which
was produced in the United
States. The U.S. government has
condemned the film.
"The ones who should be held
accountable and boycotted are
those who support and protect
the producers, namely the U.S.
administration," Nasrallah said.
He called for protests on Mon-
day, Wednesday, Friday, Satur-
day and Sunday.
He urged protesters to call
on their leaders to express their
anger too.
"We should not only express
our anger at an American
embassy here or there. We
should tell our rulers in the
Arab and Muslim world that
it is 'your responsibility in the
first place' and since you offi-
cially represent the govern-
ments and states of the Muslim

world you should impose on the
United States, Europe and the
whole world that our prophet,
our Quran and our holy places
and honor of our Prophet be
respected," he told his followers
in a televised speech.
Nasrallah said he waited to
speak out about the film until
Sunday, when Pope Benedict
XVI ended his three-day trip to
Lebanon.
In Pakistan, police fired tear
gas and water cannons at the
protesters in Karachi after they
broke through the barricade
and reached the outer wall of
the U.S. Consulate, police offi-
cer Mohammad Ranjha said.
The protesters threw stones and
bricks, prompting the police to
beat back the crowd with their
batons. The police and private
security guards outside the con-
sulate also fired in the air to dis-
perse the crowd.
One protester was killed dur-
ing the clash, said Ali Ahmar,
spokesman for the Shiite Mus-
lim group that organized the
rally.

Unhealthily intrusive
Smoking bans only further stigmitize smokers
More than a year after becoming a smoke-free cam-
pus, the University has come to be a poster child
for national tobacco-free programs. On Wednes-
day, Howard Koh, the assistant secretary for health at the U.S
Department of Health and Human Services, used the Univer-
sity as the site to officially launch the nationwide Tobacco-
Free College Campus Initiative. While the initiative may have
healthy intentions, a widespread smoking ban does not pro-
mote the tolerance expected from a college campus. Smok-
ing is a personal choice, and universities shouldn't attempt to
intrude so much into students' privacy.

We never have the elite, smart
people on our side."
- Former presidential candidate Rick Santorum said in a speech Saturday at the Values
Voters Summit, according to CBS News.
Is ignorance really bliss.?

The nationwide Tobacco-Free College
Campus Initiative aims to increase the num-
ber of smoke-free campuses. Currently 17
colleges are smoke-free, including the Uni-
versity. Since July 1, 2011, all of the Univer-
sity's campuses - Dearborn, Flint and Ann
Arbor - have been smoke-free. Under the
ban, members of the community are forbid-
den to light a cigarette on University prop-
erty, including outside associated buildings.
The smoke-free policy relies on students and
faculty informing the office of Student and
Conflict Resolution when they encounter
someone who isn't complying with the ban.
This approach is unenforceable at its core.
More than a year after the ban, students, staff
and other members of the community still
remain confused about whom they should
consult when they see someone smoking.
Even if they are aware of the office, many may
be reluctant to file a complaint, either feeling
uncomfortable 'tattling' on another campus
member or not wanting to bother with the
paperwork. Other universities adopting a;
smoking ban will likely encounter this prob-
lem of enforceability when drafting their
own policies.
Instead of turning toward an all-out ban,
universities across the country should look
for other ways to encourage students to quit

the unhealthy habit. From offering free nico-
tine patches and gum to providing counseling
services that help smokers kick the habit, the
University has taken positive steps to sup-
port smokers quitting at their own pace. If
colleges across the country want to protect
the health of students and faculty, admin-
istrations should ensure that anti-smoking
resources are provided and publicized to the
university's community. Education and sup-
port are the best ways to help addicts - not
unenforceable punishment.
"Treating smokers with respect is impor-
tant in breaking the cycle of behavior," said
Dr. Robert Winfield, director of University
Health Service. Yet respect is the last thing
smokers receive under these campus-wide
smoking bans. Universities should be mod-
els of tolerance, but policies that encourage
chastising stigmatized behavior do anything
but foster such an environment.
Koh, speaking on campus on Sep. 12,
said the University should be applauded for
"Instilling an anti-tobacco culture," While
this maybe true, a smoking ban promotes dis-
crimination against people who smoke, rath-
er than promoting a culture willing to help
people quit. Tolerance should be the norm in
a university setting and a smoking ban will
only go up in smoke.

Sam looked to his left, then to
his right, making sure none
of his fellow party members
were around to
hear what he
was about to say.
He knew, just as
well as I did,that
if anyone heard
him, the conse-
quences would
be dire not only PATRICK
for himself, but MAILLET
also for his wife
and his newborn
daughter. "I just
wish we had real elections like
you," he said, in perfect pronuncia-
tion, almost like he had practiced
the phrase in front of a mirror, "I
am tired of not having a voice."
The conversation took place
approximately three and a half
months ago while I was living in
China for the summer. For the first
month of my stay, I lived in the
southern city of Hangzhou teach-
ing English to high school students
throughout the Zhejiang Province.
Part of my job was traveling to vari-
ous schools with English-speaking
Chinese teachers who would help
translate certain parts of my pre-
sentation. Sam was one of my bilin-
gual coworkers. Sam and I would
travel throughout the province,
practicing Chinese and English
along the way. His English was
phenomenally better than my Chi-
nese, along with his understanding
of American culture. In particular,
Sam was fascinated by American
politics. No matter what the topic,
he would always somehow steer
back to talking about President
Obama or the 2012 election.
When he told me his desperation
for a "voice," I understood what he
was referencing. China is having
an election this year. This election
will take place at the end of October
and will mark the end of President
Hu Jintao's ten-year-term. China's
election is very different compared

to what we're used to in the United
States. Onlymembers of the Chinese
Communist Party are able to vote, a
group that is more than 80 million
people strong. While that may seem
like a lot, remember that China's
population is close to 1.4 billion
people, so only about .06 percent of
the population can vote. Also, the
term "vote" is used very loosely.
Their "choice" is whether or not
they support the single candidate,
Xi Jinping, to be the next leader. If
they choose "no," their party mem-
bership will almost immediately be
revoked and there's a decent chance
that they and their familycould lose
their jobs or even be detained.
Sam has been a party member for
five years. He said he applied to bea
member because it offered his fam-
ily more opportunity. So when he
said those fateful words about his
desperation for the right to free and
fair elections, I could do nothing but
sit back, shocked and speechless. I
hadn't asked him for his opinion on
our elections, nor had I even asked
him what the election process in
China was like. Sam was just des-
perate to get these radical feelings
off of his chest, and a 20-year-old
American kid who obviously didn't
know enough of the Chinese lan-
guage to rat him out was the perfect
person to express them to.
Like China, the U.S. is in an elec-
tion year, but ours isn't clouded
by repression or a lack of choice.
Regardless of how flawed one may
think our political system is, I
promise you that it could be much
worse. Unlike hundreds ;of mil-
lions of people around the world,
we Americans have an inalienable
right to make our voices heard and
to single-handedly affect the way
our lives are governed. All too often
I hear my friends say that they are
not going to vote this year because
they don't know enough about the
election, don't think that their vote
will actually make a difference, or
my personal favorite, they believe

no matter who wins, everything in
D.C. will stay relatively the same.
Some of the people who tell me this
are extremely involved citizens
who are passionate about social
issues, yet for some reason believe
that their interests are unconnected
to the presidential race. Our presi-
dential race is between two agen-
das that are more polarized than
any election in recent decades.
Unlike past elections, Americans
throughout the country will be able
to decide between two radically
different men with two radically
different approaches to solving our
nation's problems. From women's
reproductive rights to national
security, virtually every element of
American life is subject to change as
a result of November's election.
Unlike your
fellow global
citizens, you have
a voice. Use it.
Regardless of who you support,
I implore you to take an interest in
this upcoming election, especially
those of us voting in Michigan, a
toss-up state that will undoubt-
edly help shape this election. Invest
the three minutes that it takes to
register to vote with any one of
the countless volunteers who will
be scattered throughout campus.
Remember that unlike so many of
your fellow global citizens, you have
a voice.
Sam's daughter will be turning
two this spring. Perhaps by the time
she turns 18, she will have the same
extraordinary power we Americans
possess, but odds are she won't.
Remember that come Nov. 6.

Why women still can't
have it all on TV

ummer is over, and with it
went the simple, comfort-
ing pleasures of summer
reading. Perhaps you - like me -
used the extra, textbookless time
to drift away
in some fic-
tion or refill
your maga-
zine stockpile.
But of all the
things I read
this summer,
few were as
pervasive as KAYLA
a particular UPADHYAYA
article in
the Atlantic
that was emailed, tweeted at
and shared with me too many
times to count: "Why Women
Still Can't Have It All," by Anne-
Marie Slaughter, former Director
of Policy Planning for the State
Department.
Being both a feminist and a
TV columnist, I've been think-
ing about how Slaughter's argu-
ment holds up on television. Are
fictional women still confronted
with obstacles in the workplace?
The answer isn't as simple as no,
but it's a far cry from a yes. So
let's look at why women still can't
have it all ... on television.
First, some parameters.
Slaughter's piece focuses on a
very specific group of women -
upper-class, educated, predomi-
nantly white women in positions
of power. She recognizes her nar-
row scope, and while I see a lot
of limitations to her viewpoint, I
will look at a similarly privileged
group of television's highest
ranked female characters for the
sake of consistency.
Many women on television
are either really good at their
careers or really good at raising a
family - rarely both. And if they
prioritize their career, they're
demonized. No example makes
this clearer than Patty Hewes
(Glenn Close) on FX's legal thrill-
er "Damages." Patty made a firm
choice early in life to place her
legal career before everything
else, and the other characters
and the show itself paint her as
quite the monster. She's a ruth-
less ladder climber who bullies
and manipulates her son Michael
(in his words: "You wanted to
completely control of my life, so
you took away my free will. Some
pretty terrific parenting, real
mother-of-the-year type stuff.")
and habitually forgets her grand-
daughter's birthday.
At first, Ellen Parsons (Rose
Byrne) of "Damages" seems to be
the anti-Patty. She is dedicated
to her family and her career. She
even turns down her initial inter-
view with Patty's firm to attend
her sister's wedding. But as the
series continues, Ellen is forced to
make difficult choices - and the
second she starts placing the legal
stuff over the personal stuff, she's
criticized for it. In season four,
her boyfriend tells her that there

And by fun - it's a wickedly
clever concoction of puppet

that pushes the boundaries set

"Coraline." The film's beauti-

a breath of fresh air in light of
all the current children's fea-

purely mechanical and sloppy

sequence in which Norman

well done. Even if you don't end

realize it's all done in clay.
In addition, the action doesn't
feel watered-down or tame just
because it's a kids film. The
directors and animators aren't
afraid to showcase "Dawn of

blown off with shotguns At the
same time, things never really
get too out af hand because
the clay sculpting technique

The plot follows an
"Inception"-esque formula: The
characters trapped and sepa-

that they must escape within

what made "Inception" work so
well was the complex motives of
each character and the always-

them. That frantic atmosphere
is nowhere to be found in this
wannabe, where Alice (reprised
by Milla Jovovich) must escape
from an underwater facility.
And that's the story: a 95-min-

would've taken 20-30 minutes.
As a result, "Resident Evil: Ret-

Anti-Putin demonstrators
gather in Moscow streets

'U' alum launches new
venture to aid students in
entrepreneurial efforts

Thousands join
in renewed anger
toward president
MOSCOW (AP) - The first
major protest against President
Vladimir Putin after a summer
lull drew tens of thousands of
people, determined to show that
opposition sentiment remains
strong despite Kremlin efforts to
muzzle dissent.
The street protests broke out
after a December parliamentary
election won by Putin's party
through what observers said
was widespread fraud, and they
grew in strength ahead of Putin's
effectively unopposed election
in March to a third presidential
term.
Huge rallies of more than
100,000 people even in bitter
winter cold gave many protest-
ers hope for democratic change.
These hopes have waned, but
opposition supporters appear
ready to dig in for a long fight.
"We have to defend the rights
that we were deprived of, the
right to have elections. We were
deprived of honest elections
and an honest government,"
opposition activist Alexander
Shcherbakov said. "I've come to
show that and to demonstrate
that the people are opposed. I'm
opposed to the illegitimate gov-
ernment and illegitimate elec-
tions."
Leftists, liberals and national-
ists mixed with students, teach-
ers, gay activists and others as
they marched down Moscow's
tree-lined boulevards chant-
ing "Russia without Putin!" and
"We are the power here!" Many
wore the white ribbons that have
become the symbol of the protest
movement.
About 7,000 police officers
stood guard along the route of
the march, and a police helicop-
ter hovered overhead. A pro-
test rally, held on a wide street
named for the late Soviet dissi-
dent Andrei Sakharov, remained
peaceful as it stretched into the
evening. As the 10 p.m. deadline
neared, a couple of hundred peo-
ple were still on the street and
police herded them toward a sub-
way station. One of the opposi-

tionleaders, Sergei Udaltsov, was
detained along with a handful of
his supporters when he tried to
lead a group of about50 on a new
protest march.
Putin has shown less tolerance
for the opposition since his inau-
guration in May. New repressive
laws have been passed to deter
people from joining protests, and
oppositionleadershavebeensub-
ject to searches and interroga-
tions. In August, a court handed
down two-year prison sentences
to three members of the punk
band Pussy Riot for performing
an anti-Putin song inside Mos-
cow's main cathedral.
Big balloons painted with
the band's trademark balaclava
masks floated over the crowd on
Saturday, while some rally par-
ticipants wore T-shirts in sup-
port of Pussy Riot.
Many demonstrators targeted
Putin with'creative placards and
outfits. Some mocked Putin's
recent publicity stunt in which
he flew in a motorized hang
glider to lead a flock of young
Siberian white cranes in flight.
One protester donned a white
outfit similar to the one worn by
Putin on the flight with a sign
reading: "Give up hope, each of
you who follow me." Another
person held a placard that said:
"We are not your cranes."
Alexei Navalny, a charis-
matic anti-corruption crusader
and a popular blogger, remains
the rock star among the protest
leaders. When he took the stage,
young people in the crowd held
up their phones to record the
moment.
Navalny urged the demon-
strators to show resolve and
keep up the pressure on the
Kremlin with more street pro-
tests.
"We must come to rallies
to win freedom for ourselves
and our children, to defend
our human dignity," he said
to cheers of support. "We will
come here as to our workplace.
No one else will free us but our-
selves."
The rally appeared as big as
the last major protest in June,
which also attracted tens of
thousands. More of the demon-
strators, however, came not as
members of the varied politi-

cal organizations that make up
the protest movement, but with
groups of friends and co-work-
ers, some of them organizing on
social networks.
As part of a new initiative,
activists collected contact infor-
mation and addresses from
demonstrators to make it easier
to organize civic actions on a
neighborhood level.
Gleb Pavlovsky, a former
Kremlin political consultant,
who attended Saturday's rally,
estimated that up to 500,000
people have taken part in the
protests in Moscow, a city of 11.5
million.
He said the Kremlin has not
figured out how to deal with the
protest movement.
"Therefore, they alternate
between taking tough action
and stepping back from con-
frontation," Pavlovsky said. "For
the Kremlin, it is very worrying
that Moscow no longer supports
Putin, but it is very important
that this is purely a Moscow
phenomenon."
Although opposition protests
also were held Saturday in sev-
eral other Russian cities, the
largest, in St. Petersburg, drew
only a few thousand people. Pro-
tests elsewhere attracted only
hundreds or even dozens. About
100 attended an unsanctioned
rally in Nizhny Novgorod and
about 20 of them were detained.
The Moscow organizers had
spent days in tense talks with the
city government over the protest
route for Saturday, typical of the
bargaining that has preceded
each of the opposition marches.
A protest on the eve of Putin's
inauguration ended in clashes
with police, and the Kremlin
responded by arresting some of
the participants and approving
a new draconian law that raised
fines 150-fold for taking part in
unsanctioned protests. The city,
however, granted permission for
the subsequent opposition rally
in June, which was peaceful.
A day before the weekend
rally, parliament expelled an
opposition lawmaker who had
turned against the Kremlin and
joined the protest movement.
Anger over the ouster of Gen-
nady Gudkov may have helped to
swell the ranks of the protesters.

Google executive
Dave Girouard
discusses Upstart
program
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
DailyStaffReporter
Most college students are
faced with two options upon
graduation: pursue a seem-
ingly unrealistic Plan A, or fall
back on a secure, but unfulfill-
ing Plan B. One former Google
executive is trying to ensure
that more students opt for Plan
A.
About 450 people packed
into Stamps Auditorium to
attend a lecture by Dave Gir-
ouard, a former Google exec-
utive and University alum.
Girouard discussed Upstart,
a company he founded to help
match student entrepreneurs
with accredited investors
eager to mentor and financial-
ly support students's start-up
dreams.
The Friday lecture was the
second installment of Entrepre-
neurship Hour, a class through
the Center for Entrepreneur-
ship that hosts weekly seminars
with distinguished business
leaders.
Engineering sophomore Neil
Sood - vice president of proj-
ects for MPowered, a student
support organization for entre-
preneurs - briefly discussed
Girourard's career at Google,
noting his success as the presi-
dent of Google Enterprise,
including Gmail and Google
Calendar.
"It's safe to say he's a big
deal," Sood said.
Girouard first spoke to the
trajectory of his career after he
left the University. Like many
college graduates, he picked a
safe job with a large company
rather than pursuing his true
passions.
"I took the jobs that, quite
frankly, were prestigious," Gir-

ouard said. "Once you start a
job, prestige doesn't mean any-
thing."
Girouard detailed his move
from consulting to work for
Apple, which he described as
the "dark ages" in the com-
pany's history. From Apple,
he took a position at Google
for eight years, which he said
afforded him freedom he hadn't
experienced at previous jobs.
"It was fun more than any-
thing else when I got to Google
to be on a winning team," he
continued.
He said the trust his boss -
Google's CEO Larry Page, fel-
low University alum - showed
in his abilities was something
he wanted to replicate for a
younger generation, which
inspired his own business,
Upstart.
Upstart came to fruition
about a year ago when Gir-
ouard began talking to stu-
dents on college campuses to
gage interest in a program that
would fund and mentor start-
up ventures.
"Kids usually just take jobs
from the campus recruiters,"
he said. "Students have loans,
little or no access to credit ...
(but) these people have poten-
tial."
Students at the University
and nine other schools, includ-
ing Yale, Stanford and New
York University, can create a
profile that Girourard and his
team will assess before inves-
tors pick students to support.
If the student's business
becomes profitable, 3 percent
of the income will go back to
the investor over a 10-year
period. The company charges
1.5 percent of the repayment as
a service fee, which Girourard
explained as "borrowing from
their future."
Girourard said in an inter-
view that the reason he picked
the University as one of the
pilot locations was because offi-
cials on campus have been sup-
portive of the program from its
onset.

"In the end it really became
this great, great institutional
support up and down the Uni-
versity, all the way to President
Coleman, for 'entrepreneurship
matters and we need more of
it,"'he said. "That doesn't exist
everywhere, it's pretty unique."
He said his company's long-
term goal is to make Upstart
available to a broader range of
college campuses.
"We sort of did the math on
a napkin," he said. "If we can
really do what we hope in a
decade ... we can help create a
million new businesses in the
U.S."
Heather Patrick, a Univer-
sity alum and current Florida
resident, said she made the trip
to meet Girourard in-person
and discuss her entrepreneur-
ial aspirations.
"I was in my Plan B and it
was going nowhere," Patrick
said. "And if I didn't take the
risk to do my Plan A now, then
what's a better time?"
Business and LSA senior
Han Zhang said he thought the
lecture was very informative
and found similarities between
Upstart and Kickstarter, a pro-
gram that garners funding and
support for creative projects.
"I think it's an interesting
business model," Zhang said.
"There's a lot of similar ideas
that are coming out of Kick-
starter ... and I think this has
taken a unique spin on taking
future money as opposed to
present money."
LSA junior Sarah Oleinick
said she appreciated Upstart's
focus on the individual.
"The biggest question it
raised for me was pitching your
ideas versus pitching yourself,"
Oleinick said. "Upstart gives
you an opportunity to show-
case yourself and what you can
do instead of pitching some-
one your idea and having them
back that."

Electronic health
records now more
readily accessible
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily StaffReporter
The University of Michigan
Health System, along with two
local physician groups, has
entered a partnership to share
health information across the
state of Michigan.
In conjunction with the IHA
Health Services Corporation
- an Ann Arbor-based multi-
specialty group practice - and
the Huron Valley Physicians
Association - an association
of physicians from Washtenaw,
Livingston, Lenawee and west-
ern Wayne Counties - UMHS
has joined the Great Lakes
Health Information Exchange.
The program aims to provide
a secure network to access
electronic health records in
real-time for physicians in
Michigan.
IHA employs more than
1,100 physicians, nurse prac-
titioners, physician assistants
and midwives in 35 southeast-
ern Michigan practices, and
HVPA has more than 600 phy-
sicians in its coverage area.
In an announcement Friday,
UMHS claimed that instant
access to records will decrease
medical errors and enhance
patient care. UMHS said physi-
cians will be able to access data
efficiently for patients who have
visited other GLHIE facilities.
A real-time exchange also
eliminates the current practice
of faxing medical documents,
which is a much slower access
process. GLIHE will pull infor-
mation from multiple sources,

including previous hospital
admission and discharge docu-
ments, transfer notifications,
inpatient and outpatientpapers,
test results and physician notes.
Andrew Rosenberg, chief
medical information officer for
UMHS, said in a statement that
GLHIE's database modernizes
medical collaboration while
speeding up patient record
transfers in a cost-effective
manner.
"This modern health infor-
mation exchange will radically
change the way physicians are
able to share health records,"
Rosenberg said. "The ultimate
goal is to speed up access to
critical health documents while
reducing costs and improv-
ing coordinated, high-quality
care."
According to Rosenberg,
GLHIE hopes to reduce pre-
ventable mistakes, such as
unnecessary test duplications,
withthe information exchange.
"When a patient comes to us,
we can immediately see which
tests they've had and that we
don't need to repeat, as well as
which hospitals they've been
to, their allergies and any other
health history," Rosenberg
said.
Chris Holda, IHA vice presi-
dent of information technology,
said in a statement that readily
available access to basic patient
information will improve the
quality of patient care.
"IHA is looking forward to
building on our important rela-
tionship with UMHS," Holda
said. "Through GLHIE, our
expanded technical and data
capabilities will allow us to
have access to critical informa-
tion about our patients, leading
to better and more coordinated
care for our patients."

SCORE
From Page 1A
Michigan punished and pum-
meled a team that is just three
games into its move from Divi-
sion 1-AA, and it had 41 fresh-
men on its roster after having to
add 22 scholarship football play-
ers to meet the minimum NCAA
requirements.
Let's be clear from the outset
- it was an undersized, under-
manned, glorified intramural
team on the opposing sideline on
Saturday.
That isn't to show any disre-
spect to Massachusetts, but the
Minutemen came more for the
$650,000 payday than they did
a true competition. They knew
that, so did Michigan.
"If you want to be one of the
best teams in the land you need
to know what a great team looks
like and what a great program
looks like," Massachusetts coach
Charley Molnar said in a tele-
conference last week. "Going to
Michigan, that will really open
the eyes of our football players
to see what a great team looks
like, how a great program does
their business, this is how hard
they play, this is what their ath-
letes look like, this is what we
aspire to be.
"It took Michigan 100-plus
years to get where they are at,

other cafes because Elixir attracts
a specific type of coffee connois-
seur.
He acknowledged that the
economy has had some negative
effect on profits, but the losses
have not been significant enough
to deter the shop's owners, Ed and
Mike Renollet, from expanding.
"We've had a couple good years
in a row," he said. "We found a spot
that, in terms of us and our busi-
ness model, is pretty much ideal."
TIM HORTONS TO OPEN
THREE STORES
Tim Hortons, the Ontario-
based coffee and bakery chain,
will join the Ann Arbor coffee
scene in the coming months with
three stores near campus accord-
ingto local property managers, in
addition to various other Washt-
enaw Countylocations.
Brynn Burton, a Tim Hor-
tons spokeswoman, wrote in an
e-mail that the company does not
comment on stores that haven't
opened yet.
"What I can say is we are look-
ing to expand throughout the
state of Michigan, where we cur-
rently have restaurant locations,
including new areas like Ann
Arbor," Burton wrote.
Eastern Michigan University
student Nicole Minney, a man-
ager of Biggby Coffee on East
Liberty Street, said she thinks

the addition of Tim Hortons to

have a ways to go but we have
at least a vision of what a great
team looks like."
It's taken 133 years, I suppose.
A win's a win, and kudos to
the Wolverines for getting the
job done, but temper your take-
aways from this 50-point vic-
tory. It didn't mean anything.
It did nothing for Michigan's
quest for a Big Ten champion-
ship. It won't impress any poll-
sters or recruits. And it didn't
appear to do much to prepare
Michigan for a matchup with
upstart Notre Dame next week.
But Hoke and the players
kept pointing back to a differ-
ent reason that the Michigan-
Massachusetts matchup served
a purpose for Team 133. That's
the "team morale factor," as
Hoke put it.
Chemistry, morale, team spir-
it; there's something to be said
of their importance, especially
for a team that traveled a slim
majority of the 110-man roster to
a rout against Alabama in week
one, and came off a nail-biter
win against Air Force.
It was an old-fashioned beat-
down. Robinson tossed the ball
around the field to the tune of
291 passing yards - his fourth-
highest career total - but even
more importantly he connected
with nine different receivers.
Eight different Michigan players
scored touchdowns in the full-
team effort.

the Ann Arbor coffee market may
actually improve her store's sales
because customers will prefer
Biggby's coffee.
"(Customers) know they have
the cappuccinos, but they're not
the same cappuccinos we have
and ours are way better quality,"
Minney said. "I think they'll see
that we're a way superior product
and they'll come in here more."
One of the three Tim Hortons
stores is slated to open in the new
Landmark apartment complex on
the corner of South Forest and
South University avenues. No
Thai! is also expected to move
into Landmark.
NEOPAPALIS BRINGS
ITALIAN CUISINE TO ZARA-
GON WEST
Students craving a slice of
pizza will have another parlor to
consider as NeoPapalis opens on
the corner of East William and
Thompson streets in the new
Zaragon West apartment develop-
ment.
The restaurant, an authentic
Italian-style pizza bar from the
owners of metro Detroit area
shop PizzaPapalis, will feature
build-to-order pizza, salads and
sandwiches, as well as pizza by-
the-slice, according to owner Joe
Sheena.
Sheena has a son at the Uni-
versity and said his son's friends
and students on campus seemed
receptive to the restaurant's idea.
"The concept that we're build-
ing here is set for campus-style
food," Sheena said.
Time Patino, general manager
of Cottage Inn Pizza located next
door, said he doesn't think Cot-
tage Inn's sales will be affected
because his sit-down restaurant
attracts a different crowd.

"I don't think it's going to have

fourth quarter, and every starter
took the sideline to support the
rookies.
"Them having the ability
to play in this football game,
in front of 110,000 family and
friends, I think that's great,"
Hoke said.
And it is great. (Forget that
there were probably only 40,000
people left in the stadium.)
But don't forget tontake the
rosy glasses off for at least a
moment. Cox could tell you the
last time Michigan played a
game like this one. It was Oct.
17, 2009 and Delaware State
was in town - one of the three
games Cox ever got a carry at
Michigan.
The final score was 63-6. Cox
ran for 90 yards and scored the
only two touchdowns of his
career. (His 85 yards against
Michigan on Satuday was his
second-best career game.)
But that rout of hapless Hor-
nets was no barometer of Michi-
gan's success. The Wolverines
and Tate Forcier didn't win
another game that season, losing
to Penn State, Illinois, Purdue,
Wisconsin and Ohio State.
Not a nice memory, is it?
Don't get carried away. It's dog-
gone hard to take much out of a
50-point blowout, so don't hurt
yourself trying.

an impact on us, we do so much
more," Patino said. "We have a full
menu, we do a lot of catering, we
have a lot of in-house banquets."
Patino added that he's looking
forward to having a new business
open on East William Street, and
thinks NeoPapalis will be suc-
cessful.
"I think if anything it's going
to ... create business," he said.
"There's more of a reason to come
on this side of William Street."
MAPLE BRINGS CHIC
MALE CLOTHING TO E. LIB-
ERTY ST.
Though posters plastered
across campus read, "Don't shop
at Maple," Brandon Schram, Uni-
versity alum and co-owner of the
new men's clothing shop, is hop-
ing you will.
The posters, which were
placed around campus this week,
are part of Schram's advertising
campaign to garner interest in his
store.
Schram and his partner, Brad
Friedman, opened shop at 406 E.
Liberty St. about a week ago. In an
e-mail interview, Schram wrote
that the clothing and accessories
store is marketing to the male
sophisticates that populate the
University's campus.
"From day one, we wanted to
make sure that we had a pres-
ence in Ann Arbor, as we strongly
believe that our store can fit nicely
in to the Ann Arbor retail scene,"
Schram wrote.
He said that while it was diffi-
cult to leave a steady nine to five
job, he and Friedman believe the
risk will pay-off.
"(Ann Arbor) is a vibrant city
and there are thousands of stu-
dents and locals who we believe
are willing to support the type of

store that Maple is," he wrote.

Students board one of seven hybrid buses on campus on Saturday.

because its employees also use
the buses.
"Based on the amount of
service (UMHS has) devel-
oped recently starting this year,
they've started providing some
capital for the buses," Johnson
said.
For the first four hybrid buses,
Johnson said the additional
$170,000 required for a hybrid
bus, as opposed to a diesel bus,
was covered by a grant from
the Clean Energy Coalition's
Michigan Green Fleets program,
a program funded by the U.S.
Department of Energy.
Though more expensive than
traditional diesel buses, hybrid
buses offer increased fuel econ-
omy and the release of fewer
pollutants, Johnson said. Spe-
cifically, he said the buses release
30-percent less fuel emissions
than a diesel bus, cutting down
on both operational costs and
pollution.
Johnson said the hybrid buses
arrived on schedule, in line
with replacement schedules for
older buses. With a 12 to 14 year
replacement cycle per bus, John-
son said it is expected the entire
fleet will be hybrid in the next 10
years.
"It evens out the budget
impact, and in 12 or 13 years when
we try to replace them again we
don't have another big expendi-
ture," he said.
Johnson said an added ben-
efit of using hybrid buses is
lower maintenance costs. With
a diesel bus, brakes are normally
replaced at 40,000-50,000 miles,

while hybrid buses can go as far
as 85,000 miles before brake
replacements are needed.
"Because the engines don't run
at a constant high load like a die-
sel engine does, you can extend
your maintenance intervals a
little, which does provide some
cost savings," Johnson said. "The
hybrid system itself, while not
maintenance-free, is less mainte-
nance intensive."
Passengers of hybrid buses
will also experience added ben-
efits from the new buses, such as
expanded seating.
"It's a little bit smoother ride
- not as jerky - because with
electric power, you don't have the
constant shifting of the transmis-
sion," Johnson said. "Although
it helps, as far as the difference
between riding a diesel bus and
riding a hybridbus, moststudents
probably won't notice a huge dif-
ference."
Andy Berki, manager of the
University's Office of Campus
Sustainability, said the buses
increase awareness of sustain-
ability efforts on campus.
"They're important really from
avisibility standpoint more than a
direct impact on our greenhouse
gas emissions," Berki said. "If you
look at the University as a whole,
over 95% of our greenhouse gas
emissions on campus come from
heating and cooling our build-
ings, and a small percentage of
direct emissions actually come
from our transportation fleet."
Berki added that the buses also
serve as a traveling advertise-
ment for campus sustainability.
"The bus, being a hybrid bus,
it's a visible thing," Berki said.

"So it's really important for usto
have that visible element to our
sustainability efforts on campus
so people can really get a feel for
what we're doing and kind of get
on board."
Berki said he hopes students
take notice of sustainability
efforts on campus, like the new
hybrid buses, and get involved in
sustainable efforts at the Univer-
sity and beyond.
"The students on our cam-
pus are really the lifeline of our
future, so the more students that
get active and involved in sus-
tainability efforts, those are the
same students that are our future
leaders and hopefully will carry
some of this work forward after
they leave the University to make
real change," he said.
LSA sophomore Alex Por-
zondek, a frequent bus rider who
began working as a bus driver at
the start of summer, said he sup-
ports the decision to purchase the
hybrid buses for the sake of the
environment.
"I think it's a good way to keep
the environment healthy," Por-
zondek said.
Briauna Horton, an LSA soph-
omore who used the buses often
while living on North Campus
last year, said she believes sus-
tainability is critically impor-
tant to the University despite the
financial challenges.
"I believe that being more
environment friendly is worth
the cost because it helps pre-
serve our environment and that
is important," Horton said. "I
would like for (hybrid buses) to
be cheaper, but unfortunately we
are not there yet."

CSJ hears case on College
Republican leadership in
wake of attempted ousting

Organization
claims elected chair
broke Robert's
Rules
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Five months of ambiguity in
the leadership of the Univer-
sity's chapter of the College
Republicans is nearing an end
after the Central Student Judi-
ciary heard opposing arguments
from the chair and executive
board for more than four hours
into the wee hours of Friday
morning.
In April, the executive board
began impeachment procedures
against its newly-elected chair,
LSA senior Rachel Jankowski,
claiming she allegedly broke
Robert's Rules - guidelines for
parliamentary procedure - by
amending the group's constitu-
tion without prior notice.
The constitutional amend-
ments Jankowski passed, how-
ever, would prevent the chances
of her impeachment by requir-
ing a two-thirds vote of the gen-
eral membership, in addition
to an executive board vote, to
remove her from office.
In his written opening state-
ments, LSA junior Russ Hayes,
the internal vice chair of the
College Republicans, alleged
that Jankowski drafted the
amendments to shield herself
from impeachment.
"The spiritofthe amendments
passed were to circumvent
impeachment proceedings," he

respective school government
branch and the new overarching
graduate student government.
Parikh argued that CSG is
actively involved with gradu-
ate students, despite graduate
student representatives' sparse
attendance at CSG meetings. In
particular he cited a CSG assem-
bly resolution from the win-
ter 2012 semester that pledged
$35,000 to childcare funding
that is primarily used by gradu-
ate students, and the AirBus air-
port transportation program, of
which he said approximately 30
percent of participants are grad-
uate students.
He added that CSG also
developed the Graduate Student
Affairs Commission last year,
and is looking to increase its
involvement with graduate stu-
dents. Parikh noted that gradu-
ate student organizations are
an "administrative priority" to

said.
Hayes also argued the execu-
tive board was not planning to
impeach her originally in April.
The executive board, he said,
merely wanted to discuss differ-
ences between the two sides.
Hayes said while Jankowski's
actions as the president had led
to "concern," the board's pre-
ferred course of action was not
impeachment.
"Our initial cause for want-
ing to meet with Ms. Jankowski
wasn't to remove her from office,
but to sit down with her and talk
about why we had to move for-
ward as a team," he said.
One of Jankowski's improper
actions, Hayes said, was com-
mitting funds from the Col-
lege Republicans to events with
"polarizing political activists,"
like the Randy Hekman cam-
paign, then a candidate seeking
the Republican nomination for
Michigan's U.S. Senate seat.
However, Jankowski said that
is not the case.
"This event had started to
be planned under the previous
executive board," she said. "The
other members of the (current)
voting executive board were well
aware of the event."
She also argued that the
amendments to the constitu-
tion were an "attempt to provide
more transparency to the group."
"Keeping in mind that the
group's officers are elected bythe
general membership, the amend-
ment specified that the removal
of an officer must also be done
by a vote of the general member-
ship, since they were the ones
who voted the elected member
in," she said.
him.
According to Parikh, the
Student Organization Funding
Committee - the main funding
body of CSG - allocates funding
to groups regardless if they are
graduate or undergraduate stu-
dents at the University.
Parikh stressed that Rackham
is not the only school with grad-
uate students at the University.
If the separation occurred, the
Ford School of Public Policy, for
example, would have its under-
graduate students represented
by CSG while its graduate stu-
dents would represent the new
graduate student government.
"Central Student Government
has done some amazing things
(for) graduate students, and I'm
going to be taking it to another
level through the course of this
administration," Parikh said.
Rackhams student Elson Liu
has been at the University for a
decade and has been an off-and-
on member of student govern-
ment since 2007. Most recently,
Liu was a member of the Univer-

LSA junior Elena Brennan,
the College Republicans external
vice chair, said whether or not
the amendments were appropri-
ate isn't the matter at hand.
"She did not (give prior
notice)," Brennan said. "There-
fore, all of the amendments of
which Ms. Jankowski intro-
duced are in fact void."
Still, Jankowski called the
alleged violations of Robert's
Rules and any other alleged mis-
deeds of her candidacy "fabri-
cated and trumped-up at best."
Brian Koziara, a senior advi-
sor to the group who support-
ed Jankowski's amendments,
called the allegations against
Jankowski "politically motivat-
ed" during his testimony on the
witness stand.
"It's senseless to use (the
rules) just to air grievances
against voting executive board
members," Koziara said. "Of
course they were upset that
(she) got elected, and they want-
ed to remove (her) as soon as
possible."
Jankowski said the strug-
gle over control in the group
throughout the months-long
ordeal has often crossed the pro-
fessional boundary, specifically
pointing to an incident where
she claimed members of the
executive board were actively
following her in April.
"This stalking incident con-
vinced me that this was no lon-
ger a simple matter of these
voting e-board members want-
ing to air their grievances," she
said. "Rather, this had become
a politically motivated witch-
hunt and attempt to remove me
for petty personal purposes."
sity Election Commission dur-
ing the March 2012 election.
Liu said the idea of a separate
graduate student government
was brought up in 2010 when
the student government revised
its constitution, but the idea was
eventually dismissed.
"I think there is value in hav-
ing a body where every student
at the University of Michigan is
entitled to representation," Liu
said. "I think that value would
be lost if, instead of that, you
had two or more bodies inde-
pendently representing dif-
ferent segments of the student
body.
Liu added that a separate
graduate student government
still may not increase graduate
student governmental partici-
pation.
"In the more general case, I
think the average graduate and
professional student is equally
indifferent to the Central Stu-
dent Government and to their
respective school and college
government," he said.

Bill McKibben addresses the crowd at Rackham Auditorum on Friday.
Environmentalist McKibben
urges sustainable lifestyles

Founder of
350.org talks
climate change,
renewable energy
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Renowned environmentalist
Bill McKibben visited the Uni-
versity Friday afternoon to urge
activism for sustainable efforts,
and highlight environmental
issues plaguing the world.
At the event at Rackham
auditorium, co-sponsored by
the Erb Institute for Global
Sustainable Enterprise and the
Graham Sustainability Insti-
tute, McKibben shared pic-
tures and stories of his personal
battle against the oil industry,
before answering questions
from audience members.
"Unless we understand the
scale and pace of (global warm-
ing), it's hard to understand
what scale of solution we need,"
McKibben said in his opening
remarks.
McKibben's website, 350.org,
was founded in January 2008 to
raise awareness of global warm-
ing, and was inspired by findings
by Tim Hanson, a scientist for
the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration. Hanson
found that the safe limit of car-
bon dioxide in the atmosphere is
350 parts per million, and there
is currently 392 ppm.
On October 24, 2009, 350.org
helped spur 5,200 demonstra-
tions in 181 countries to pro-
test lowered carbon emissions.
Despite the protests, McKibben
said world leaders need to col-
laborate to establish policies cen-
tered on sustainable practices.
"It should've been enough,"

and FestiFools founder, who
teaches a class through LHSP
that creates giant puppets for the
April parade - said the steer-
ing committee for the festival
has had trouble finding enough
money to hold the event. Accord-
ing to Tucker, in the past, the
event has been funded by LHSP,
private donors to the School of
Art & Design, grants and the
LSA Dean's Office.
"What we do now is just try
to keep our head above water,"
Tucker said. "It would be nice to
see what's ahead five years and

McKibben said. "(Our leaders)
should be taking action, but
they're not."
During his address, McKibben
proceeded to provide an array of
examples of how the Earth has
been negatively impacted by
human pollution.
"Think about the oceans -
our metaphor for vastness," he
said. "The ocean is 30 percent
more acid than it was four years
ago. Its pH, its chemistry, has
changed in a dramatic fashion."
McKibben examined the
erratic weather patterns that
North America has experienced
in the last six months - includ-
ing the national heat wave last
March - using it as another
example of how global warming
has impacted the environment.
"You recall it because it kind
of felt nice ... but it kind of felt
ominous too," he said. "It wasn't
supposed to be like that. Every
flower and tree went immedi-
ately into blossom, and in April
when we had the typical frost,
that was that."
McKibben also discussed how
the abnormal weather nega-
tively impacted grain harvests
in North America, leading to an
increase in prices. He said that
while the 15to 16-percenthike in
costs was manageable for some,
it severely affected many Ameri-
can citizens.
He also shared his initiative to
inspire religious organizations
and schools to divest from fossil
fuel companies.
After discussing the plan,
McKibben closed with words
meant to inspire the crowd.
"I don't know if we're going to
win, but I sure as hell know we're
goingto fight," he said. '
After the speech, listeners
moved to the lobby to mingle,
and had the opportunity to get a
copy of McKibben's book signed.
what it could be like, where it
could go creatively."
Tucker said the new millage
may open the community's eyes
to the city's numerous art insti-
tutions.
"I think public art - if you
start to see fantastic public art
- it makes the invisible visible,"
Tucker said. "And (Ann Arbor)
is a town that embraces the arts
and people should know about
it," Tucker said.
Tucker added that he feels it's
a public duty for the city to pro-
vide art to its residents
"(Art) adds to the whole cul-
tural fabric of where we live,"
Tucker said. "You can't have
something that's great for only
people who can afford it."

LSA freshman Lindsey Scul-
len said she heard about the
event in her environmental writ-
ing class and came because she is
interested in working to protect
the environment.
"There were moments during
the speech where Iwanted to cry
almost," she said. "I knew it was
a problem, but I didn't realize
how large of a problem it was."
Scullen said that after hearing
McKibben's speech, she plans on
getting involved in an environ-
mental organization on campus.
Kyle Overman - an LSA
senior and a member of Students
for Clean Energy, a new organi-
zation on campus - went to the
event to support the movement
for sustainable living.
He added that SCE plans on
asking University President
Mary Sue Coleman to sign a
petition that will show the
University's commitment to
becoming 100 percent sustain-
able.
Fifth-year LSA student
Joseph Evergreen Snow
Varilone was one of the few
audience members who got a
chance to ask McKibben a spe-
cific question.
"I wanted to get a sense of
where the state of the environ-
mental movement is at, specifi-
cally the part of the movement
that has a broad following," he
said.
Varilone said he thinks the
problems McKibben spoke of
are widespread, adding that he
questions the methods of coun-
teracting global warming.
"I think, in some ways, this
is a problem more drastic than
we've ever seen before and
drastic problems require dras-
tic solutions," Varilone said.
lan Dillingham contributed
to this report.
Art & Design sophomore
Gabby Holzer said she antici-
pates seeing more temporary art
pieces in the city if the millage
passes.
"I always like to see chang-
ing art." Holzer said. " ... It will
catch your eye and it gives you
a good experience from a poten-
tially mundane task, like if you
are going to CVS or something."
Grace Ludmer, an Art &
Design sophomore and a Fes-
tiFools participant, said her
appreciation for Ann Arbor is
enhanced by its diverse art.
"(Art) creates so much more
of a culture to the community,
especially in Ann Arbor, in such
an open and young community,"
Ludmer said.

Michigan blows Saturday afternoon, manhan-
dling FBS newcomer Massachu-
out Minutemen setts from start to finish.
On the first drive of the day, the
in return trip to Wolverines looked like they were
playing against a scout team.

football team caught a break on Michigan beat down Massachu-

setts 63-13.
Robinson completed two pass-
es on the first drive - a 16-yard
toss to fifth-year senior tight end
Mike Kwiatkowski and a 26-yard
touchdown strike to freshman
tight end Devin Funchess. With
those completions, he moved to
sixth on Michigan's all-time pass-
ing yards list, passing current
New England Patriots quarter-
back Tom Brady.
Later in the first quarter,
Michigan was finally able to get

redshirt junior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint going. He
had a rough start in his return
to the backfield last week when
he picked up only seven yards on
eight carries after he served a one
game suspensionthe week before.
Against the Minutemen, Tous-
saint matched his rushing total
from last week on his first carry
of the game. And on Michigan's
second scoring drive, he slipped
a couple of tackles on an 11-yard
scamper to the end zone.

Toussaint finished the con-
test with 85 yards on just 15 car-
ries, and this may have been the
bounce-back performance that
coaches say he needed to get back
in a rhythm.
On the Wolverines' next scor-
ing drive, early in the second
quarter, Robinson completed a
quick pass to wide-open junior
receiver Drew Dileo in the mid-
dle of the field, who ran the ball
another 50 yards after the catch
down to the Massachusetts five-

yard line.
"I did think I was going to
score," Dileo said. "But I guess
that's why they call me, 'the white
receiver.'
On the play, Robinson moved
up another spot on Michigan's
all-time passing last, jumping
current San Francisco 49ers head
coach Jim Harbaugh for No. 5.

Cooper Barton reigns as

Let's hear it for the Michigan Marching Band

Patrick Fleming was buried
in his Michigan Marching
Band uniform.
Fleming, a sophomore trum-
pet player, died on Sept. 26, 2011 r
in a car crash on US-23 near
Fenton, Mich. Scott Boerma,
director of the Michigan March-
ing Band, still remembers the
call from his receptionist on
that Monday morning. He had
just stepped out of his office in
Revelli Hall to grab lunch at the
mall.
"That can't be true," he
thought, staring at the phone in
his hand. "How could that have
happened?"
He'd experienced a loss in the
band before, when he was a high
school director in Novi, Mich. -
But that student was in a long-
time battle with leukemia; they
saw that one coming, they had
time to prepare.
"That's indescribable,"
Boerma said. "You never expect
something like that to happen."

I chose band over newspa-
per in high school. I've been
around music enough to know
that it's more than a hobby. It's
a lifestyle. It's one of the biggest
commitments you can make in
college.
My oldest sister, Stephanie,
graduated from Michigan State
with a degree in horn perfor-
mance. My oldest brother, Dan,
graduated from the University
of Michigan's School of Music,
and my twin brother, Peter, is
currently enrolled there.
"Oh, so you're with the band?"
folks will ask them.
Well, they're in a band, but
not the band. Actually, only a
handful of music majors are
even in the marching band. It
takes too much time, too much
effort, too much pain. The band
is comprised of primarily LSA
and Engineering students; it's
their last hurrah in the music
world.
"I love to tell people that,"
Boerma said. "People usually
assume it's all music majors."
You see, the band that takes
the field every Football Saturday
in Ann Arbor, isn't so different
from you and me. They just work
a lot harder, and often deal with
a lot more.
This column is long overdue.
This weekend, with the Min-
utemen in town, felt especially
appropriate.
So, this is for the band. For
the 380 students that can't help
but walk in step - in eight-to-
five steps - across campus. For
those who find beauty in uni-
form horn angles and a polished
bell. For those who know that
a right foot step-off is the most
unsettling feeling in the world.
It's for the ones who know
that a season with the Michigan
Marching Band can provide
more ups and downs and a lon-
ger disabled list than the foot-
ball team - and just about as
many hours of practice.
Maybe next time you'll show
up a few minutes early and see
the band emerge from the tun-
nel into the iconic 'M.'
Maybe you'll keep an eye on
the field at halftime, knowing
the time and effort put into
earning a spot in the perfor-
mance block. Maybe you'll
remember Patrick Fleming, who
will rest forever in maize and
blue.
I know I will.

From Page 1B
was. Freshman tight end Devin
Funchess had just scored a touch-
down, the first of the game, and
the roar was loud. But it was loud-
er minutes later when Barton was
introduced on the field.
"Aww nothing," Barton,
unfazed, said of the ovation.
At half time, the 5-year old held
court in the press box. About 15
reporters gathered around Bar-
ton. The cameraman had to hold
his lens at his thigh to get at his
eye level, and one reporter kneeled
down to ask him questions.
Barton spoke at a nervous hush
at first, but then grew comfort-
able after he saw reporters smil-
ing at his answers. At one point, he
claimed he could run faster than
senior quarterback Denard Rob-
inson.
He mimicked Robinson, lei-
surely using his two fingers to
make a running motion. Then he
switched up and waved his hands
rapidly.
"I'm this fast," Barton said.
In mid-August, Barton wore a
Michigan shirt to school and was
forced to turn it inside out because
of a policy that bans all college
shirts other than those from
Oklahoma and Oklahoma State.
After hearing his story, Michigan
Athletic Director Dave Brandon
invited Barton and his family of
Michigan fans to the game on Sat-
urday. And he had a special gift for
Barton.
"Look!" Barton said as he lifted
up his Michigan shirt. Brandon
had the underside printed too, so
that way, it couldn't be reversed.
After the introduction on the field,
Barton was chaperoned around
the stadium and met players after
the game.
"We'vebeentryingto warn him
about it for the last couple days,
but it seems to me, Cooper's not
phased by much," said his father,
Chris Barton. "There's no one
thing that's cooler than the other.
This whole thing has just been
really cool."
As Chris spoke, Barton reached
up and grabbed his face. Nearby,
his mother, Shannon, who sport-
ed maize and blue painted nails,
smiled sheepishly as in disbelief.
"He's still just five," she said.
MOORE HONORED WITH NO.
87: The No.87jersey ofRon Kram-
er was on the field on Saturday, but
only before the game. Michigan
honored fifth-year senior Brandon
Moore with Kramer's Legend's
jersey and patch in a pregame cer-
emony.
That was it for the jersey on
Saturday. Moore sat out the game
with an injury.
In the 1950s, Kramer was a
two-time All-American as a offen-
sive utility man and a defensive
end. He also played basketball
and ran track and later played for
the Green Bay Packers. Kramer is
the third Michigan football Leg-
end. Desmond Howard received
the honor last year, and Bennie
Oosterbaan was recognized last
week.
"I didn't know why coach Hoke
wanted to see me in his office,"
Moore said. "I couldn't believe
it. When you think of the history
and tradition of this program and
some of the great players like Ron
Kramer, to carry on that legacy,
that responsibility, is humbling."

INJURY UPDATES: No Michi-
gan players were injured in Sat-
urday's game. Besides Moore,
sophomore linebacker Desmond
Morgan, junior fullback Stephen
Hopkins and redshirt sophomore
defensive lineman Richard Ash
did not dress due to injuries.
Hoke said Morgan and Hopkins
should play next week against
Notre Dame. He said Morgan sus-
tained a "head thing."
SHOELACE UNTIES RECORDS:
Barton might doubt Robinson's
speed, but Massachusetts prob-
ably doesn't. The quarterback
rushed for another 106 yards and
a touchdown on Saturday which
moves him into a tie for fourth on
Michigan's career rushing touch-
down list, tied with Chris Perry
with 39.
That wasn't it for Robinson.
His 16th career 100-yard rushing
game ties him for fifth with Butch
Woolfolk on the all-time Michigan
list.
Robinson threw three touch-
downs along with 291 yards
through the air. That moves him
past both Tom Brady and Jim
Harbaugh for fifth for most career
passing yards in Michigan history.
His 397 total yards moves him
into second place for total yards
in Michigan history, trailing only
Chad Henne.

being accountable for my team,"
Robinson said. "So, when it
comes to records, it's just going
out there and playing football
with the team."
Michigan scored on the next
snap on a handoff to senior run-
ning back Vincent Smith, who
punched it in fairly easily, mak-
ing the score 21-3. Smith would
score again in the third quarter
- he found the end zone twice on
just three carries on the day.
The Wolverines' only hic-
cup of the first half came on the
next possession, when Robinson
was picked off by Christian Birt
on Michigan's own 16-yard line,
which was returned easily for
Massachusetts's lone touchdown
of the day.
"Jeremy Jackson came open,"
Robinson said. "I just threw it
behind him, and it was a bad
throw. I mean, it was a good read,
just a bad throw. I got to put my
feet into it and follow through
with the throw."
Robinson got back on track
quickly though. On the next pos-
session, he found a wide-open

Justice Hayes and freshman
Dennis Norfleet made their
offensive debuts, they were two
of seven total players to carry the
ball on the afternoon.
But the focus was on squarely
on Toussaint, who didn't look
like himself in his season debut
against Air Force last week. In
that game, the Youngstown, Ohio
native managed just seven yards
on eightcarries, often hounded by
defenders before even getting out
of the backfield.
It was a far cry from the Tous-
saint that the Wolverines had
grown familiar with by the end of
last season, when he emerged as
one of the better backs in the Big
Ten.
Against the Minutemen, Tous-

field, and he took it 42 yards for
the score. And on the following
possession, Robinson took off for
the races, scrambling from one
sideline to the other on a 36-yard
touchdown run.
On the following drive, the
Minutemen marched down the
field and kicked a field goal, leav-
ing Robinson and the Wolver-
ines a solid two minutes to work
with before the half. Robinson
led a methodical eight-play drive
down to the Massachusetts one-
yard line. On the ninth play, he
kept the ball but fumbled before
reaching the goal line, and red-
shirt junior left tackle Taylor
Lewan recovered it.
"I think there was a little
debate about who actually fell
on it first," said fifth-year senior
right guard Patrick Omameh.
Dileo added: "For the record,
I'm pretty sure it was (fifth-year
senior) Elliott Mealer's touch-
down, not Taylor's."
The first half ended with
Michigan in control, 42-13.
The second half of the game
was more of the same. After the
Michigan defense forced a quick
three-and-out, the offense start-
ed its first drive of the half in
Massachusetts territory. On the
fifth play of the drive, Robinson
saint played more like his 2011
self than the version from the Air
Force game, totaling 87 yards and
averaging5.7yards-per-carry. For
an offense that's searching for
another threat to help take pres-
sure off Robinson - as dynamic
as he is, the coaching staff real-
izes he can't carry such a heavy
burden over the whole season -
Toussaint's rejuvenation was a
welcome development.
"The more threats we have
as an offense, the more danger-
ous we can be," said fifth-year
senior offensive lineman Patrick
Omameh. "Everybody knows that
we have Denard Robinson, who's
a special kind of player. The more
pressure we can take off him, the
better we'll be as a team."
Yet the way that Michigan
coach Brady Hoke talked about it
in his postgame press conference,
you would've thought that the
Wolverine backs did nothing on

Connor Barton and his family pose with drum major Jef frey McMahon.

found a streaking Roy Roundtree
in the end zone for a 19-yard
score.
The hookup was encourag-
ing for Roundtree, who has been
mostly silent this season despite
his role as the veteran leader of
a thin receiving corps. The play
was just Roundtree's fourth
reception of the season, and it
was his longest.
Once Michigan mounted a
43-point lead in the fourth quar-
ter, redshirt freshman quarter-
back Russell Bellomy entered
the game, and Robinson took a
seat. Robinson finished his day
16-of-24 passing for 291 yards,
three touchdowns and one
interception. He also rushed 10
the ground.
With a dissatisfied, edgy tone,
Hoke bemoaned the play of the
offensive line, which, in his mind,
was subpar. That was nothing dif-
ferent from the first two games
of the season - the coach has
been talking about needing more
up front since the offensive dud
against Alabama in the season
opener.
Hoke's tenor was more curi-
ous on Saturday because of how
much better the running backs -
and, by association, the offensive
line - looked against the Minute-
men. He said Toussaint looked
only "okay," and that he wished
the runner would've been more
decisive in going up field at cer-
tain times.
Part of the issue may be Sat-
urday's opponent. Massachusetts
doesn't represent the same quali-
ty of competition that the Wolver-
ines have faced to this point, and

times for 106 yards and another
touchdown. Despite the solid
all-around performance, both
coach Brady Hoke and players
said there is much to improve on,
especially on line play on both
sides of the ball.
"Of course, any win is a good
win," said senior defensive tackle
Will Campbell. "And every game,
everybody is not going to have
a perfect game, so everybody's
going to have mistakes that we
can capitalize on and correct for
the next week.
"If we play like we did today,
we will not win next week (at
Notre Dame). We need to come
out and play like Michigan
defense."
that they will face as the season
goes on. The true test of the line's
and the backs' play may be next
week against Notre Dame.
"That's a big part of it," Hoke
said when asked about the impor-
tance of finding someone to take
pressure off Robinson. "That's
why we need to block better in
the traditional run plays with the
running back ... We've got to find
more (playmakers)."
Then, unprompted, the coach
mentioned needing better play
from the line to have a running
back be a playmaker. It was a
clear reference to Toussaint, who,
along with the rest of the backs on
Saturday, finally looking comfort-
able.
But for Hoke, the traditional
running game is in a similar place
to Toussaint when he broke that
tackle, suspended in motion. He's
still waiting for that burst for-
ward.

THE QUICK BREAKDOWN
I Z E cG /U G E The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Denard-o-Meter measures the success of quarterback
Denard Robinson, the Man-o-Meter judges Michigan's "Manball," how physically it played in the trenches, and the Hype-o-Meter measures the fans' performance.

3/4
Denards

The only thing slowing down senior quarterback
Denard Robinson are his shoes, or more accurately,
his occasional lack of shoes. Well, that and the pick-
six. Saturday's was his second in three games.

2/4
Hokes

Michigan coach Brady Hoke was not very happy
with the line play on both sides of the ball, but it
was an improvement. The defense surrendered
just six points.

HYPE-O-METER
Good job. Good effort. Those who stayed were
lonely. And a large portion of the student section
4/ didn't even show up at all. The double wave was a
Big Houses failure. Just a pitiful showing.

LOOKING GOOD FEELING BLUE

FIFTH-YEAR SENIOR RECEIVER
ROY ROUNDTREE: Roundtree
was probably growing tired
of answering questions about
his lack of production. Against
Massachusetts on Saturday,
he finally answered on the
field. Roundtree had just two
receptions, but scored his
first touchdown of the season,
an 18-yard reception in the
third quarter. His attitude
always draws praise from his
teammates, as does his blocking,
but Michigan needs him to
develop into a go-to receiver.

FIFTH-YEAR SENIOR CENTER
ELLIOTT MEALER: Mealer didn't
have any glaring mistakes on
Saturday. In fact, he hasn't had
any glaring mistakes all year,
impressive for a center starting
for the first time in his career. But
after the win over Massachusetts,
players said that Mealer was
robbed of a touchdown. Redshirt
junior left tackle Taylor Lewan
was credited with the second-
quarter touchdown, though
players indicated later that it
was Mealer who actually fell on
the fumble in the end zone.
