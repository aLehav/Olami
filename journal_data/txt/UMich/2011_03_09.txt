'U' policy follows
federal law, campus
police abide by
state mandate
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily Staff Reporter
University students who get
caught on campus with marijua-
na but produce a medical mari-
juana registration card may still
face repercussions even though
state law says they are legally
allowed to possess the drug.
This is because the Univer-
sity's Alcohol and Other Drug
Policy for Students, Faculty
and Staff operates under fed-
eral law, which still mandates
that marijuana is illegal even for
medical use. However, the Uni-
versity's Department of Public
Safety abides by state regula-
tions, which allow registered
patients to use marijuana for
medical treatment.
Michigan voters passed the
Michigan Medical Marihuana
Act in 2008, which made medi-
cal marijuana legal for regis-

tered patients. Under the state
law, patients can have up to 2.5
ounces of usable marijuana and
up to 12 marijuana plants if
they grow their own medicine.
Caregivers - people who assist
medical marijuana patients who
don't grow their medicine -
can also have up to 2.5 ounces
of usable marijuana and up to
12 marijuana plants for each
patient they care for.
Michigan state law recog-
nizes findings from studies like
a 1999 report from the National
Academy of Sciences' Institute
of Medicine that conclude mari-
juana can be an effective treat-
ment for relieving pain, nausea
and other debilitating medical
conditions.
However, the University's
AOD Policy still maintains an
unequivocal ban on all marijua-
na. This is because the AOD Pol-
icy follows federal law, which
still classifies marijuana as a
Schedule I drug under the Con-
trolled Substances Act. Schedule.
I drugs are the most restricted
of the five drug classifications
and are not acknowledged to
have any medical benefits.

Athletic director
discusses his
surpising start in
business
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Exactly one year after he
took over as Michigan Athletic
Director, Dave Brandon reaf-
firmed his primary goal for

Michigan athletics: domination
over Ohio State.
"I want to kick Ohio State's
ass," Brandon said to roaring
applause in the Ross School of
Business Blau Auditorium yes-
terday.
Addressing about 70 stu-
dents, Brandon spoke about
issues ranging from his self-
proclaimed "storybook" career
to the future of the Michigan
Football program.
Brandon began the conver-
sation by pointing out that he

was an unconventional can-
didate for the job of athletic
director since he never meant
to enter the business world to
begin with.
A former Michigan football
player, Brandon graduated
from the University in 1974
with a bachelor's degree in
teaching. But his plan to go into
teaching or coaching was never
realized. Instead, he started
working in business immedi-
ately after graduating college.
In an interview after his lec-

ture, Brandon said his work in
business has been rewarding,
and he doesn't regret abandon-
ing his initial goal to go into the
teaching field.
"I felt like I could always go
back to teaching and coaching,"
Brandon said. "I didn't know
that 30 years later I would still
be in the business world, but I
always felt that (teaching) was
something I could go back to."
However, Brandon said his

New genetic tests claim to
identify athletic abilities

Scientists find
genes that play role
in strength, speed
CHICAGO (AP) -Was your kid
born to be an elite athlete? Mar-
keters of genetic tests claim the
answer is in mail-order kits cost-
ingless than $200.
Some customers say the test
results help them steer their chil-
dren to appropriate sports. But
skeptical doctors and ethicists say
the tests are putting profit before
science and have a much greater
price tag - potentially robbing
perfectly capable youngsters of a
chance to enjoy activities of their
choice.
"In the 'winning is everything'
sports culture, societal pressure
to use these tests in children may
increasingly present a challenge to
unsuspecting physicians," accord-

ing to a commentary in Wednes-
day's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
Scientists have identified sev-
eral genes that may play a role
in determining strength, speed
and other aspects of athletic per-
formance. But there are likely
hundreds more, plus many other
traits and experiences that help
determine athletic ability, said Dr.
Alison Brooks, a pediatrician and
sports medicine specialist at the
University of Wisconsin in Madi-
son.
Brooks and University of Mich-
igan physician Dr. Beth Tarini
wrote the commentary to raise
awareness about the issue.
A handful of companies are
selling these tests online. In some
cases, the tests screen for genes
that are common even among
non-athletes. As science advances,
Brooks said, "My guess is we're
going to see more of this, not less."

Bradley Marston of Bountiful,
Utah, bought a test online a year
ago for his daughter Elizabeth,
then 9.
She's "a very talented soccer
player," and Marston wanted to
know if she had a variation of a
gene called ACTN3, which influ-
ences production of a protein
involved in certain muscle activ-
ity.
One form of the gene has been
linked with explosive bursts of
strength needed for activities
such as sprinting and weight lift-
ing.
The ACTN3 test sold by Atlas
Sports Genetics was developed
by Genetic Technologies Limited,
an Australian firm. Atlas' $169 kit
consists of two swabs to scrape
cells from the inside of the cheek.
Customers return the used swabs
to the Boulder, Colo., company and
receive an analysis several days
later.

Friends, family gather for funeral of
Mich. high school basketball player

16-year-old Wes
Leonard collapsed
after making
winning shot
HOLLAND, Mich. (AP) -
Classmates, coaches and for-
mer opponents were among the
mourners who filled a southwest
Michigan church yesterday to
celebrate the short life of a teen
athlete who friends and fam-
ily say will have a long-lasting
impact.
Many of the more than 1,500
people at Wes Leonard's funeral
wore orange ribbons, and some
released orange and black bal-
loons outside the church, mir-
roring the colors of the Fennville
High team that he made a game-

winning shot for last week before
collapsing on the basketball
court.
The night before they paid trib-
ute to Leonard at the church, his
teammates honored the 16-year-
old junior as they played through
their grief to win their first game
in the state Class C tournament.
Those who knew the "larger
than life" football and basketball
star always recognized thathe was
special, even apart from sports,
his uncle, Jim Leonard, said dur-
ing the church service. National
attention in the wake of Leonard's
death has touted his character to a
far broader audience.
"It's just amazing that now
the whole world knows how spe-
cial he was," Jim Leonard said at
Christ Memorial Church. "Wes
will not be forgotten."
Leonard died of cardiac arrest

from an enlarged heart last
Thursday, moments after his shota
gave the undefeated Blackhawks
a victory to wrap up the regular
season.
Opponents said they admired
Leonard's game-winning feats in
basketball and football - he also
was the Fennville football team's
star quarterback - but they also
respected his grace, sportsman-
ship and leadership.
"No negativity," said Devin
Brock, a Bloomingdale basket-
ball player who competed against
Fennville, said of Leonard. "He
was always positive."
Fennville is a town of about
1,400 near Lake Michigan,
but the school district covers
a broader area. A bus from the
Gobles and Bloomingdale dis-
tricts arrived at the funeral with
more than 70 students.

Experts: Mass fish
deaths unusual but
not unheard of
REDONDO BEACH, Calif.
(AP) - An estimated 1 million
fish turned up dead yesterday in
a Southern California marina,
creating a floating feast for peli-
cans, gulls and other sea life and
a stinky mess for harbor authori-
ties.
Boaters awakened to find a
carpet of small silvery fish sur-
rounding their vessels, said Staci
Gabrielli, marine coordina-
tor for King Harbor Marina on
the Los Angeles County coast.
Authorities said there was also a
12- to 18-inch layer of dead fish
on the bottom of the marina.
California Fish and Gameoffi-
cials said the fish were sardines
that apparently depleted the
water of oxygen and suffocated.
"All indications are it's a
naturally occurring event," said
Andrew Hughan, a Fish and
Game spokesman at the scene.
The die-off was unusual but
not unprecedented, he said.
"In the world of fishing this is
an afternoon's catch," he noted.
Nonetheless, the scale was
impressive to locals at King Har-
bor, which shelters about 1,400

boats on south Santa Monica Bay.
"The fishermen say they've
never seen anything this bad that
wasn't red tide," Hughan said,
referring to the natural blooms of
toxic algae that can kill fish.
Hughan said water samples
showed no oils or chemicals
that could have contributed to
the deaths. He said some of the
fish were being shipped to a Fish
and Game laboratory for study
but the cause was likely to be
uncomplicated.
The fish appeared to have
come into the marina during the
night and probably couldn't find
their way out, he said.
"The simplest explanation is
the fish got lost. ... They get con-
fused easily," he said.
Hughan said there was no
safety issue at all but "it's going
to smell bad for quite a while."
Fire Department, Harbor
Patrol and other city workers set
to work scooping up fish in nets
and buckets. A skip loader then
carried them to big trash bins.
Local officials initially estimat-
ed there were millions of fish,
but Fish and Game roughly esti-
mated about 1 million.
City officials estimated the
cleanup would cost $100,000.
Fire Chief Dan Madrigal said the
fish would be taken to a landfill
specializing in organic materials.
On the water, nature was tack-

ling the problem in other ways.
"The seals are gorging them-
selves," Hughan said.
Large groups of other fish
could be seen nibbling at the
floating mats of dead creatures.
"The sea's going to recycle
everything. It's the whaole circle-
of-life thing," Hughan said.
Although the Fish and Game
authorities were focusingon the idea
that the sardines simply gat con-
fused,othertheoriesabounded.
Hughan noted that some fish-
ermen reported waves were com-
ing over the harbor breakwaters
during the night. That washes
bird excrement off the rocks and
into the marina and can cause the
water to be depleted of oxygen.
Gabrielli, the marina employ-
ee, said the fish appeared to have
moved into the harbor to escape
a red tide, then possibly became
trapped due to high winds over-
night.
Ed Parnell, a marine ecolo-
gist at Scripps Institution of
Oceanography called Gabrielli's
theory plausible, although gen-
erally he would expect that the
wind would have mixed oxygen
into the water. Parnell said these
types of fish kills are more typi-
cally seen in the Gulf of Mexico
or the Salton Sea, the enormous
desert lake in southeastern Cali-
fornia where millions of fish die
with some regularity.

Supreme Court
dismisses 'In God
We Trust' case
The Supreme Court won't hear
an atheist's latest challenge to the
U.S. government's references to
God.
Yesterday, the court refused
to hear an appeal from Michael
Newdow, who says government
references to God are unconsti-
tutional and infringe on his reli-
gious beliefs.
This appeal dealt with the
inscription of the national motto
"In God We Trust" on U.S. coins
and currency. The 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco
says the phrase is ceremonial and
patriotic and "has nothing what-
soever to do with the establish-
ment of religion."
The court refused to hear New-
dow's appeal of that decision.
"In God We Trust" was first
put on U.S. coins in the 1860s and
on paper currency in the 1950s.

MEDICAL POT
From Page 1A
The most recent version of the
AOD Policy - which is updated
every two years - came out last
August. Consistent with federal
law, the policy states that "the
use, possession or cultivation of
marijuana in any form and for
any purpose continues to violate
the UM Alcohol and Other Drug
Policy and is prohibited at the
University of Michigan."
The policy abides by federal
law because of the University's
reliance on federal funding. The
Drug-Free Schools and Commu-
nities Act states that an institute
ofhighereducationthatreceives
federal funding "must certify
that it has adopted and imple-
mented a program to prevent
the unlawful possession, use, or
distribution of illicit drugs and
alcohol by students and employ-
ees" or risk forfeiting its eligibil-
ity for federal funding.
Mary Jo Desprez, the Univer-
sity's AOD Policy and Preven-
tion administrator, wrote in an
e-mail interview that after the
Michigan Medical Marihuana
Act passed in 2008, there was
a "thorough review and dis-
cussion" of how to deal with
medical marijuana use among
students.
However, since the University
must comply with federal law to
receive federal funds for pro-
grams such as financial aid and

change the state's tax systems.
"When he got elected, he
had an agenda of change that
I think is long overdue in our
state," Fraser said. "I indicated
that I was willing and would
help them in that exercise."
Fraser said his current job as
city administrator - which will
end on April 29 - consists of
day-to-day operational respon-
sibilities similar to those of a
chief operating officer. Having
worked in local governments
across the country for more
than 47 years, Fraser said he has
enjoyed his position because it
allows him to impact the lives
of Ann Arbor residents.
"We're given the opportunity
to affect people's lives on a daily
basis in a positive way," Fraser
said. "We have the ability here
to make things better for the
folks that live in our commu-
nity."
Reflecting on his time in
office, Fraser said he is proud
he helped improve the way the
city manages its budget, espe-
cially since the Ann Arbor City
Council was worried about its

finances when he first took the
job.
However, Fraser said the city
may still have a few fiscal obsta-
cles to overcome.
"We still have some financial
struggles ahead of us," he said.
"Some of the decisions that are
being made at the state level
are going to impact cities in a
very difficult way financially, in
addition to the difficulties we're
experiencing as a consequence
of other decreasing revenues."
Fraser added that his out-
look for Ann Arbor's future is
an optimistic one. He said he
is excited the city will formal-
ly open its newly built Justice
Center - which now houses

Free Workplace Act - to con-
struct the most recent version
of the AOD Policy. She added
that the committee also looked
at what other states had done to
adjust to medical marijuana leg-
islation.
University Housing Spokes-
man Peter Logan said all stu-
dents caught with marijuana in
the residence halls will face the
same consequences regardless
of whether or not they are reg-
istered patients or caregivers, as
University Housing is in compli-
ance with the AOD Policy.
"Even if a student was caught
in a (residence) hall or an apart-
ment with what they claimed
to be medical marijuana, they
would still be subject to the
same kind of process for vio-
lation of community living
standard and go through the
same kind of conflict resolution
processes that are available to
them," Logan said.
This past year, University
Housing Security reported sev-
eral instances of residential stu-
dents with medical marijuana
cards going through student
conduct procedures for having
or using marijuana in residence
halls or on-campus apartments,
according to Logan.
While the University's policy
will comply with federal law,
DPS will enforce state law,
according to DPS spokeswoman
Diane Brown.
"The police enforce laws,
they don't enforce policy,"
Brown said. "The police will
need to enforce the laws of the
state of Michigan."
However, Brown pointed out
that the University could still

Despite his successful track
record as a city official, Fra-
ser's nine years working in Ann
Arbor included some disagree-
ments with council members.
City Council member Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1) said her
relationship with Fraser was
cordial, but they didn't always
share the same views on poli-
cies. She added that her rela-
tionship with Fraser has been
limited since most of their
interactions occur during City
Council meetings.
"We haven't always agreed,"
Briere said. "Mostly, we've
interacted enough to disagree."
She added that she isn't sur-
prised Fraser is leaving for Lan-
sing. She said Fraser told her
"he has reached a point where
he's ready to try newthings that
are of a different intensity."
City Council member Chris-
topher Taylor (D-Ward 3) said
he's appreciated the work Fra-
ser has done.
"It has been a great pleasure
working with Roger Fraser,"
Taylor said.:"His tenure at the
city has been marked by long-
term planning and resourceful-
ness in the face of tremendous
adversity."

In regard to Fraser's suc-
cessor, Briere said Ann Arbor
Mayor John Hieftje is consid-
ering asking a current staff
member to act as interim city
administrator - a standard
practice in this type of situa-
tion.
Hieftje could not be reached
for comment as of last night.
Fraser said he doesn't have
an "automatic successor" and
that council can appoint anyone
to the position, adding that he
expects the announcement will
be made within the next few
weeks.
"I expect that it will be some-
body out of my executive team,"
he said. "I'm not going to specu-
late on who that would be."

porates many aspects of being an
educator.
"I get to do a lot of interac-
tion with students and trying
to teach them lessons that I've
learned," Brandon said. "I'm
not a coach, but I coach coaches.
So I feel, to a large degree, (my
career) has come full circle."
In his speech, Brandon said
he accepted his current job
because of his long-time ties to
the University.
"I took this job because
Michigan opened up enormous
opportunities for me," he said.
Brandon pointed out how
much he's benefited from the

University in the past, including
receiving treatment as a pros-
tate cancer patient. After an
extensive search, Brandon said
he decided to get treatment at
the University's Comprehensive
Cancer Center.
"Nine years later I'm cancer-
free, and I have the Michigan
Cancer Center and the Michi-
gan Department of Urology to
thank for that," Brandon said.
Brandon said it was a no-
brainer to take a job working for
the institution that had done so
much for him.
Later, Brandon steered the
focus of his discussion to the
University's Athletic Depart-
ment, saying the program needs
to generate revenue to continue
to be self-sufficient.

"Our job is to generate the
capital we need to improve and
expand," he said.
Fielding questions about
the football program, Brandon
said improving the team will
also benefit the University as a
whole.
"As Mark Twain said, 'If
you're going to put all your eggs
in one basket, you better watch
your basket,"' Brandon said. "All
my eggs are in the football bas-
ket."
Measuring the success of the
University's athletic program
against that of Ohio State's is a
primary motivation, he added.
"I want to get to the point
that we're not as good as them,
but we're better than them,"
Brandon said.

water-filling stations, like
the two that were installed in
Mason Hall this year, to encour-
age the use of reusable water
bottles.
Art & Design senior Lauren
Sopher was inspired to write
the petition by her work on the
LSA Water Theme Semester
Student Steering Committee.
Sopher worked with Maggie
Oliver, chair of MSA's Environ-
mental Issues Commission, to
create and promote the online
petition through MSA's UPeti-

Though the commission held
events that raised awareness
about bottled water in the past,
Oliver said, this term seemed
like a good time to launch the
campaign because of the LSA
Water Theme semester.
"LSA was doing the water-
themed semester, so it's going
to be on people's minds," Oliver
said.
Sopher said buying bottled
water just doesn't make sense.
"The thing with water bot-
tles is water is a resource that
should be available to everyone.
It shouldn't be a commodity,"
Sopher said.

"thought it would be good for
students to hear from people who
have actually chaired a death
penalty case."
Though the death penalty was
outlawed in Michigan in 1846, it
was a possible outcome in this
case because it took place in fed-
eral court. The death penalty is
permissible under federal law.
Kammen said he hoped stu-
dents would value the rare
chance to speak with the differ-
ent sides involved in the case.
"I think they have a really
unique opportunity," Kammen
said. "In law school, as with
most graduate schools, you study
things in a very theoretical way...
Death penalty cases in trials are
so much different on the ground
than they are in theory, and I
think, hopefully, the students
had a unique opportunity to get
a sense of what those differences
are."
The primary strategy the
defense used to convince the jury

Kammen said, was to show that

Prioritize emergencies
Detroit needs to speed up ambulance responses
Detroit man died of a heart attack while waiting for an ambu-
lance to arrive. Relatives called 9-1-1 multiple times, but an
ambulance never came last August. Slow response times for
ambulances in Detroit are placing citizens in life-threatening situ-
ations. In January, a plan was put into place to decrease response
times, but thus far, the results have been minimal. The city of Detroit
needs to re-examine its plan for dispatching emergency responders
in order to ensure that everyone can receive medical help.

time to start

basketball exists between us and
the end of classes, final exams are
going to be here sooner than we
would like. A lucky few of us will
have better exam schedules than
the rest, but uniting us in those last
days before summer is the knowl-
edge that each of us has suffered
through a particularly difficult
two or three days of final exams,
papers and projects at some point
(or several points) in our time at
the University. This can be frus-
trating because while we should
expect our courses to be academi-
cally challenging, we should also
enjoy an academic timeline that
allows us all to finish our courses
successfully. The University needs
to better enforce a policy that
demands faculty and staff to hold
final exams during the regularly
scheduled examination window
and amend how non-final exams
are administered in the last week
of classes.
Toward the end of each semes-
ter, the University encourages fac-
ulty and staff to hold their final
exams during each course's regu-
larly scheduled examination peri-
od. While I applaud the provost's
attempts to hold faculty to the exam
schedule, the problem hasn't been
resolved - instructors aren't mov-
ing their exams to when they are
supposed to be held. As I have said

in previous columns, we have great
faculty and staff teaching excellent
courses, but their course's sched-
ule can be altered to suit their own
needs, with the cost of stressing out
some students. This is problematic
for a number of reasons.
Most notably, holding exams
in the last week of classes doesn't
afford students as much time to
prepare for their exams. The exam-
ination period following the last
day of class is designed to provide
students with adequate time to do
so. With classes, student organi-
zation work, course registration,
major events and other things
occurring the last days of class, it
can be difficult to find time to study
for each exam outside the allotted
exam period. Second, students who
have in-class exams on the last day
of their class may have multiple
exams on that same day, further
preventing them from. performing
their best to conclude each semes-
ter. This issue would be resolved
if all exams were held during the
scheduled period because exams
are better spread out, and students
can petition the University to move
exams in the exceptional case a stu-
dent has several on the same day.
Some undergraduates will dis-
agree with this. International stu-
dents and others with expensive
travel costs probably enjoy complet-
ing their exams early to allow for
longer breaks. Plane trips are pric-
ey and exhausting, and the more
time students can spend with their
family and friends back home, the
more their breaks are cost effective
and enjoyable. Moreover, in-state
and out-of-state students actually

ents who enjoy taking finals early

Front-loading
exams isn't fair
to students.

Some instructors offer non-
cumulative exams in the final week
of class and contend that their
exam need not be held in the final
exam period. For those faculty and
staff who are committed to holding
these non-final exams in the last
week of classes, students should
be given the option to take the last
exam either the day the instructor
wishes to hold the exam or during
the course's scheduled final exam
period. Giving students choices is
always helpful, and providing two
dates allows them to have better
control of their academic calendars.
Ultimately, we need a policy that
allows all students to achieve suc-
cess in their courses. This means
accommodating students who wish
to be done a week early when pos-
sible, but more importantly, afford-
ing students crucially needed study
time after an assuredly challeng-
ing semester. While some students
may benefit from moving exams to
the last day of class, all of us benefit
from having enough time to fully
prepare for each exam, revise each
paper and complete each project.
The University should ensure we
have this time.

According to several articles from The
Detroit News, the average response time for
a city ambulance is 12 minutes - four min-
utes longer than the eight-minute national
average. Many citizens estimate that ambu-
lances can take up to 20 minutes to arrive. In
certain situations, this additional time may
be the difference between life and death.
The city has restructured the system to
address citizens' concerns. The main fea-
ture of the overhaul introduces a tiered
response system, which immediately dis-
patches a basic ambulance and then sends
a more advanced one if that is deemed nec-
essary. Additionally, Detroit replaced eight
of its older, advanced ambulance units with
new, less-equipped basic life units. Accord-
ing to a March 4 Detroit News article, Dep-
uty Mayor Saul Green said "the changes will
allow the city's EMS system to improve its
average response time by 15 percent with the
ultimate goal of meeting the national aver-
age." Other changes include two proposed
ordinances. The first alters the policy requir-
ing dispatchers to respond to each call. This
change means dispatchers can prioritize
responses based on need and urgency, ensur-
ing that the people in the direst need get care
first. The second ordinance imposes a fine
on business owners who exceed an allotted
number of false alarms.

While these changes seem promising, the
city has yet to see positive results. The tiered
response system went into effect more than
a month ago, yet people in Detroit still have
to endure long wait times. According to a
March 4 MLive.com article, an older man
suffering from a stroke had to wait 45 min-
utes for an ambulance last week. This isn't an
improvement.
The reasons for the slow response times
are inefficiency and a lack of resources.
While the tiered system is a start, it isn't
being correctly executed. The new tiered
system employed in Detroit isn't akin to that
in other states where a basic ambulance is
sent first and then, if necessary, an advanced
unit is sent. In Detroit, cases are prioritized,
and only one ambulance is sent due to lack of
resources.
With outdated software, distinguish-
ing between priority cases and non-priority
cases is increasingly difficult. Thus, many
individuals who call for help are simply not
receiving it. Add to this mess broken equip-
ment, cuts inafunding and inefficient policy,
and there's bound to be confusion. Emergen-
cy responders should be acting with a sense
of urgency, and the current system doesn't
properly address emergencies. Detroit needs
to re-examine the new plan, and make
changes that actually improve services.

I like guns. They're loud, put me in touch with brash
masculinity and make me feel like I'm living on the
edge. Does this mean I should be able buy instruments
of mass murder? The debate over the role of guns in
our society is structured around two principle argu-
ments. One holds that public safety is best served by
limiting the number of people with access to lethal
force. The other connects gun ownership to a tradi-
tion of American individualism, arguing that the right
to own guns should be protected. These ideas are not
mutually exclusive - anyone who believes it's ok for
private citizens to own hunting rifles but not machine
guns has found a middle ground. Unfortunately, over
the past few years, highly-vocal extremists have man-
aged to confuse many Americans into thinking that
responsible gun laws are attacks on the freedom to
bear firearms.
There are many different kinds of guns. A sensible
debate about guns must begin with that. I first learned
to shoot with small rifles and shotguns that had to be
reloaded after each shot. Jared Loughner, the Arizona
man accused of killing six people and wounding Unit-
ed States Rep. Gabriel Giffords, used a totally different
weapon. His gun, the Glock 19, is small - seven inches
long and five inches tall - and can easily be concealed
under clothing. Loaded, it weighs two pounds - not
much more than a Nerf pistol. The Glock is a.semiau-
tomatic weapon, meaning that it shoots as fast as you
can pull the trigger. Recent changes to federal firearms
laws allow gun owners to purchase ammunition clips
with huge capacities - Loughner's Glock was loaded
with 33 rounds. The FBI estimates that a novice shoot-
er with such a weapon can fire three shots in less than
one second - or 20 shots in about six seconds.
Four years ago, Seung-Hui Cho used a Glock 19 to
kill 33 people and wound 25 others at Virgina Tech.
It's shocking that the same weapon was available for
Loughner to buy. It's a sign of a deeply flawed set of
gun laws that after two of the grisliest spectacles of
mass violence in the U.S., the weapon used to commit
them is still available in stores. Glock sales actually
increased in the days after the Giffords shooting.
Consider the implications of letting people purchase
- at Wal-Mart - weapons capable of spraying dozens

of bullets in a few seconds. Are we more or less safe
when, for $460, almost anyone can legally buya quick-
firing, concealable weapon loaded with dozens of bul-
lets?
The presence of semiautomatic pistols with extend-
ed animunition clips on the streets does not make you,
me or society as a whole any safer. In fact, it puts us
in danger. The New York Police Department, the U.S.
Border Patrol and thousands of other law enforcement
agencies arm their officers with Glocks. When almost
anyone can carry the same weapons as the police, the
police are in danger of being outgunned every time
they respond to a call.
Many believe that handguns are an important form
of personal protection. For this reason, we must dis-
tinguish between different kinds of guns. In the hands
of a responsible owner, a small revolver with six bul-
lets is enough to stop almost any crime. In the hands
of a criminal, this kind of weapon is far less dangerous
than a Glock. Common-sense restrictions on weapons
like the Glock won't keep law-abiding citizens from
defending themselves.
Some have suggested that an armed citizen can stop
a lone gunman before he does serious harm. There
was one such person at the Safeway where Loughner's
attack took place - this citizen nearly shot the man
who had wrestled away Loughner's gun.
Most incidents of mass murder in the U.S. involve
handguns. Right now, handgun laws make it possible
for almost anyone who hasn't been convicted of a
felony to buy easy-to-hide handguns that can quickly
take dozens of lives. The question of whether Ameri-
cans should be allowed to buy Glocks - or guns like
them - is very different from the question of whether
Americans should have guns. All guns are dangerous,
but only some pose a threat to society. The shootings
in Tuscan, Ariz. and at Virginia Tech prove that semi-
automatic pistols like the Glock are too dangerous to
be sold to private citizens. Responsible gun owners
should recognize that danger and join with others to
change weak laws that have cost hundreds of people
their lives.

Managing Scott's exit

Director Kevin Smith bought his own film at Sundance to distribute.
The 'State'of Smith

Kevin Smith takes
controversial new
film on the road
By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Arts Writer
One doesn't interview Kevin
Smith so much as prime him.
Simply ask the writer-director-
actor-podcast-
er about, say, Red State
the Sundance
Film Festival O r
response to Tomorrow at
his latest film 7:30 p.m.
"Red State,"
and that will Michigan Theater
be enough Tickets from $39.50
for him to
talk for a good 20 minutes about
everything from his new distri-
bution model, to the relationship
between critics and filmmakers,
to how he views his legacy as a
director.
And then sometimes, as in a
recent interview with The Michi-
gan Daily, he'll let loose with one
of his famously profane sound
bites like, "I don't want to fuck
indie film in the mouth anymore."
Whether in a script, on stage or

in person, Smith has never been
one to mince words. And when he
comes to the Michigan Theater on
Thursday with "Red State" - his
verbal high-wire act will be with
a specific goal in mind: to change
the landscape of independent
filmmaking.
Smith broke onto the indie
scene with "Clerks" in 1994, and
he's still making headlines 17
years later. After premiering "Red
State," his first work in the horror
genre, at the Sundance Film Fes-
tival in January, he sold the film
to himself instead of a distributor
and plotted a nationwide tour to
make back the movie's $4 million
budget well in advance of its wide
release in October.
It's a non-traditional strategy,
and one not without its detractors
- as the press had a mixed reac-
tion following Smith's Sundance
announcement. But the director
himself shrugs off the contro-
versy.
"Why would a journalist or a
blogger care? They're not part of
the equation. They're not buy-
ing the movie. They're not losing
an opportunity to purchase it,"
he said. "I know we did the right
thing because everyone is still
talking about it."

At the show itself, audiences
will pay premium prices to see
the movie and attend a question-
and-answer session with Smith
and the film's star Michael Parks
("Kill Bill"). Under his new SMod-
cast Pictures label, Smith's inten-
tion is to sell "Red State" without
ever buying advertising in print
or on television, saying that the
film's subject matter is too bleak
to attract a wide audience.
"The idea of doing a marketing
campaign for this movie seems
irresponsible and absolutely, baf-
flingly stupid in an economy that
has collapsed," Smith said. "And if
I can admit that, why can't other
people?"
The film itself, about a violent
fundamentalist group with a pas-
tor modeled after Fred Phelps of
the Westboro Baptist Church, is
a far cry from the carefree slack-
er comedies of Smith's past. He
got the idea for the film watch-
ing footage of Phelps being inter-
viewed for the 2007 documentary
"Small Town Gay Bar," for which
Smith was an executive producer. -
"I'm sitting there and watch-
ing this old man who looks like
your grandfather talk like Hit-
ler," Smith said of the pastor best

was the return of his one true
love, Holly Flax (Amy Ryan,
"Gone Baby Gone"). Michael
and Holly's romance returns
with the same surprising ease
it had in season five, when the
two first met. As hilarious as it is
to see a woman fall in love with
Michael, it's more heartwarming
than anything else. Good for her,
good for him! Even his employ-
ees find it hard to deter Michael
from screaming his joy from the
mountains.
And the party doesn't stop
there. Creator Ricky Gervais
made a cameo in a January epi-
sode, "The Seminar," as David
Brent, his character on the origi-
nal U.K. series. It was one of the
most memorable cold opens since
everyone in the office vomited
from Pam's (Jenna Fischer) morn-
ing sickness in 2009's "Niagara."
Hopefully Gervais will make
another appearance - until then,
promised guest stars like Will
Ferrell ("Megamind") will have to
prove worthy of this show.
The two-part finale "Goodbye,
Michael" airs in April, which
means we're down to Carell's
last four episodes (the
show returns March
24) - four more epi-
sodes of "The Office"
as we know it. But
this doesn't mean we
should stop watch-
ing. With such a
strong supporting
cast, the foundation
is in place for excel-
lent future seasons.
The show's long-
term future may be
uncertain, but it's
still not too late to
join the party.

Grace and Martin's'Home'

In a few months, seniors at
the University will be concluding
their college careers and head-
ing off into the "real world" - for
some, a question mark still wait-
ing to be filled; for others, a trip
into the corporate world of suits
and schedules. For every senior,
graduating brings up the essential
questions for the future: What am
Igoing to do? Who do I want to be?
Actor Topher Grace ("Preda-
tors") wanted to capture that

of Matt's high school friends who

"The problem (for Matt) is, he's
afraid to make a mistake," Martin
said. "He's afraid to make a wrong

perfect, like you're winning at life
on paper but then the paper kind

with?"
While Martin is perhaps a
better judge of adulthood in the
'80s than Grace (he is 37, versus
Grace's 32), he also finds "Take
Me Home Tonight" has a time-
less message for the college-age
group.
"It doesn't matter so much
what time period it actually takes
place in, but it's more what it says
about our experience as people,"
he said. "I like this one because
it looks at that time when you've
left that kind of structured world
that's set up for you ... You kind of
have to step up and get on with it
and figure out - okay, what's my
point? What am I going to do?"
The film boasts a young cast of
stars who each bring their unique
style to the production. Actors
like Martin, Fogler, Faris, Teresa
Palmer ("I Am Number Four"),
Chris Pratt (TV's "Parks and Rec-
reation") and Michelle Trachten-
berg ("Cop Out") are still on the
front end of their film careers.
"I really think there are five
20-million dollar actors in this
movie, just in the year 2019,"
Grace said. "Everybody will look
back and go, 'Man, they were all
in that movie."'

known for hate-speech slogans
like "God hates fags." Members
of the church and like-minded
individuals have been seen pick-
eting the streets of Ann Arbor in
recent years, and last week the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that
the Church's infamous staged
protests of military funerals are
protected under the First Amend-
ment. Smith says his intention
is to "defang" the organization
through what he deems his "dopey
horror movie."
Reactions to the film's Sun-
dance screening have been
mixed, which is just the way
Smith likes it.
"People who hate it, hate it with
vitriol and fire," he said proudly.
The filmmaker is billing "Red
State," also starring recent Oscar
winner Melissa Leo ("The Fight-
er"), as his second-to-last directo-
rial feature.
"I want to finish with movies
that ar' fucking weir' out there,
compelling, unnerving, disturb-
ing, controversial," Smith said.
"That's art, dude."

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

to Michigan residents is the film
Smith plans to make after "Red
State": his professed final movie,
the hockey-themed "Hit Some-
body." The film will be based on
the Warren Zevon song written
by Detroit Free Press columnist
Mitch Albom, who licensed the
rights to Smith after making him
promise to film the production in
Detroit.
"Detroit's going to serve us so
well," Smith said. "There are cer-
tain parts of Detroit where they
stopped building right around
the time where our movie takes
place." He added that he plans to
keep his promise even if Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder's recent
proposal to severely cut the state's
film tax incentives passes into law.
"If the rebate goes away, yeah,
it definitely makes (filming) a little
more problematic, but you know,
a promise is a promise," Smith
maintained. "I'm locked in with
Detroit and not in a way that I
regret."
No matter how his career plays
out, Smith is making sure he
doesn't take the safe roa . "I want
to end making sure nobody goes
'meh,' "he said.
And if the pastis any indication,
he'll end with a hell of a sound bite.

Smotrycz adds dimension
for 'M' with better post play

Sparks cracks lineup for playoffs

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Writer
Evan Smotrycz isn't the most
imposing post player in the Big
Ten.
After the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team completed its sea-
son sweep of Michigan State on
Saturday, even assistant coach
Bacari Alexander had to heckle
the freshman forward via Twit-
ter about the goofy photograph
posted on ESPN.com.
In the headline shot of
Smotrycz celebrating, his jersey
is untucked, his back is slouched
and his undershirt sleeves conceal
any muscle that may be hiding
underneath.
And then there's the hair.
It's gelled to one side and
curled up at the end, forming a
seemingly Greaser-inspired wave
of flowing locks. Smotrycz looks
more like Fonzie than an up-and-
coming Division-I athlete. And
it certainly doesn't help that the
photographer caught him as he let
out a celebratory yell - because
instead of depicting an exuberant
battle cry, he looks more a patron
at an Italian restaurant dissatis-
fied with his penne alla vodka.
Members of the Fab Five would've
cringed.
But style points aside, Smotrycz
haunted the Spartans on both
ends of the floor, finishing with
14 points, a block and three steals.
And at times, he utilized an arse-
nal of post moves and pivots in the
paint that many didn't even know
he was capable of.
Indeed, his play underneath is a
very recent development.
"Evan did almost no post
defense, no post moves in Sep-
tember, October," Michigan coach
John Beilein said after the game.
"So starting in January we really
started working with both post
defense and post offense. The last
couple weeks he's sort of attached
himself to that a little bit, know-
ing that people have taken away
his three-game - how else can he
help us?"
Beilein started playing the
6-foot-9 Smotrycz - a natural for-
ward - intermittently at center
about halfway through season.

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
While the No. 5 Michigan
hockey team was fighting for the
CCHA regular-season champi-
onship two weeks ago against
Northern Michigan, sophomore
forward Lindsay Sparks was
fighting for his season.
Throughout the season,
Sparks struggled to get into the
lineup. After starting four of
the first five games, he found
himself wearing a suit while
his team wore maize and blue
for the next nine contests. By
the time Michigan headed into
the stretch run, the offensively-
skilled forward had played in
just 10 of his team's 34 games,
mainly due to concerns about
his defense.
Sparks got his chance in the
second game of the Wolverines'
second-to-last series of the sea-
son against Western Michigan.
The good news is that he played
well, providing a spark on the
third line while registering two
shots. The bad news is that with
the postseason approaching -
where lineup changes are rare
- Sparks was still fighting for a
spot on the line-chart.

According to Michigan coach
Red Berenson, Sparks took his
game to another level in prac-
tice in recent weeks. It paid off.
He took the ice in both games of
the final regular-season series.
"You've got to take the oppor-
tunity every time you get it,"
Sparks said. "It happened to be
the last weekend. I played well
both games - last three games
- so I've got to stay in there
(and) keep playing well."
By the end of the Wolver-
ines' initial game with Northern
Michigan, Sparks recorded an
assist. It also marked the exit
for senior forward Louie Capo-
russo, who left the game with a
lower-body injury.
Two weeks removed from the
injury, Caporusso will still be
out of the lineup when Michi-
gan takes on Bowling Green in
its CCHA quarterfinals series.
Barring any unforeseen chang-
es, Sparks will still be in it. He's
found a spot (at least currently)
on the left side of Michigan's
third line, next to sophomore
A.J. Treais and senior Ben Win-
nett.
"It's been a good confidence
boost for me to play three games
in a row," Sparks said. "I feel

like I've been playing well with
Treais and Winnett and Wohl-
berg last weekend, so (I'm) defi-
nitely getting a rhythm going."
The parallels between Capo-
russo and Sparks are plentiful.
Both are slightly undersized
forwards - Caporusso 5-foot-
10, Sparks 5-foot-9 - with
speed and quick hands who are
counted on for offense first. The
two even hail from the Toronto
suburbs. But both Sparks and
Berenson agree that it isn't
Sparks's job to be a Caporusso
stunt double.
"He doesn't necessarily have
to score,"-Berenson said. "If he
gets his chances, you would like
to see him make a difference in
a game or put the puck in the net
or do what he's good at. That's
why you're out there. In the
meantime don't hurt the team
defensively. Be a solid player.
"With Louie out, somebody's
going to pick up the slack, you
never know who it's going to be.
I wouldn't put all the onus on a
player like Lindsay Sparks."
But when it comes to Friday,
Sparks hopes he can do one
thing Caporusso did alot of dur-
ing the course of the season -
help his team win games.

Freshman forward Evan Smotrycz is shooting 36 percent froi

He formed a platoon with fellow
freshman big man Jon Horford
whenever starting center Jordan
Morgan found himself benched
with foul trouble - still a frequent
occurrence, evidenced on Satur-
day when Morgan collected two
quick fouls and played just six
minutes in the first half.
But recently, Smotrycz's min-
utes at forward have been limited.
On Feb. 9, against a visiting North-
western, junior co-captain Stu
Douglass supplanted Smotrycz
in the starting five for the first
time all season, as Beilein looked
to install a more guard-heavy
offense. And the move worked -
the Wolverines racked up its high-
est point total in over a month in
the victory over the Wildcats (75).
In turn, Smotrycz has come off
the bench ever since, his playing
time seemingly dwindling with
the team's recent successes.
But on Saturday, Morgan's foul
trouble and Horford's bruised
knee provided Smotrycz with
the opportunity to show what he
could pull off against Michigan
State in the paint.
And he didn't disappoint.
Early in the first half, freshman
wing Tim Hardaway Jr. fed the
ball to Smotrycz on the low block.
He faked the shot, maintained the
pivot, took one dribble around

his man into the paint and laid it
in - all while drawing a foul from
junior forward Delvon Roe and
sneaking the ball over the out-
stretched arms of junior forward
Draymond Green.
Michigan State's two most
heralded post players were
left scratching their heads as
Smotrycz completed the 3-point
play from the free-throw line.
"I'm not trying to move all
the way to the post, but it's defi-
nitely good to have dimensions
to my game because they can't
just switch on screens," Smotrycz
said. "I can switch and take a little
guy to the post. But yeah, defi-
nitely this was the first time I was
sparring a little bit in the post."
Smotrycz's dimensions cer-
tainly make him a rising star in
the Big Ten. As he continues to
develop his game in the paint,
some defenders will forget that
they can't just crowd the lane to
stop him. After all, Smotrycz was
recruited primarily as a shooting
forward, and after going 1-for-2
from deep and 5-for-S from the
line on Saturday, he showed why
he fits so well into the shoot-hap-
py Beilein offense.
And don't forget one of
Smotrycz's best qualities on the
court - how his goofy fagade can
lull opponents to sleep.

Sophomore forward Lindsay Sparks has one goal and one assist in 13 games this season for the Wolverines.


SHADOWS
From Page 8A
all brought the ball up the floor.
The Wolverines' only true point
guard was on the bench next to
Borseth, unsure of her role.
Courtney was forced into the
responsibility of having no stabil-
ity whatsoever in terms of play-
ing time, not knowing how many
minutes she was going to get on
any given night. Against Kansas
on Dec. 9, she played 19 minutes.
Four days later, against a much
weaker New Mexico State team,
she played just nine minutes. She
kept working, hoping from her
familiar seat on the bench that
sooner or later she would get her
opportunity.
"She was one of those kids that
worked while she waited. I'm not
sure every one of them do that,"
Borseth said. "Matter of fact,
probably a greater majority of the
kids don't do that."
She got that opportunity in the
first Big Ten game of the season
against Ohio State, in the form of
Jordan's knee injury. Since then,
Courtney has been a catalyst for
Michigan's success, both through
her play and through her leader-
ship.
The following game - the first
game of 2011 - Borseth gave his
diminutive point guard the start,
only the second of her Michigan
career. Courtney walked onto
the floor with a bit of a swagger,
unafraid of the challenge. She
played like she had been starting
all season, leading the Wolverines
with 18 points in a career-high 37
minutes of play.
Courtney made Iowa defend-
ers look foolish at times - finish-
ing at the rim amidst a swarm of
towering defenders, most notably
the 6-foot-5 Morgan Johnson. She
sparked the Wolverines when they
needed it most, and led them to an
impressive third-straight win over
a ranked opponent.
After the game, Borseth called
her the "difference in the game,"
using the word "outstanding" to

describe her night.
The high school star did what
she was supposed to, leading
her college team to victories,
unabashed by the big stage. This
is what a former Miss Basketball is
supposed to do, because there are
expectations that come with such
a title. After directing the win over
the Hawkeyes, Courtney never
slowed down, and her impact has
been extraordinary for the Wol-
verines'season.
Coming off the bench, Court-
ney averaged 14 minutes, nearly
four points and a little over one
assist per game. Since beingthrust
into the starting role, she has aver-
aged 30 minutes, 10 points, and
almost two assists per game in the
regular season.
She is rarely a liability on the
defensive end, despite her height,
because her feet never stop mov-
ing. She has energy for all 40 min-
utes - and then some.
Courtney has not just been a
spark plug, but she has also taken
on a leadership role that she has
sought since arriving at Michi-
gan. Whenever there is a break
in the action, it is Courtney in the
middle of the huddle, makingsure
everybody knows what is going
on. Every other player has to look
down at her to make eye contact,
because physically she is small,
but emotionally she commands
the attention of the entire huddle.
"Sometimes I look at pictures
or I look at film and I'm like, 'Hey
that's not me, I don't look that
small out there do I?' I know that
sounds crazy, but I really don't feel
that small," Courtney said. "There
definitely are certain things I have
to do differently, but to me, on the
inside, I don't feel that small."
Simply put, she is not small
because she doesn't feel small.
Courtney is listed at 5-foot-7, but
she walks out on the court as if she
possesses the height of her room-
mates, sophomores Rachel Sheffer
and Kate Thompson, both 6-foot-
4.
Her height doesn't seem to be a
big deal to her, because she doesn't
think of herself as small.

Juniorguard Courtney Boyland has averaged 10 points per game as a starter.

"Courtney is tough," Molly said.
"Her height has never really been
an issue."
+4+
On Feb. 19, 2011, Michigan was
on the road against Wisconsin.
The team was in fourth place in
the Big Ten, one game behind the
Badgers for third, so this was a
crucial game for Big Ten Tourna-
ment seeding, as well as an NCAA
Tournamentbid.
The Wolverines had been lead-
ing for most of the game behind a
commanding performance from
Sheffer, but they trailed by four
points with two minutes left in
the game. That's when Courtney
took over. She scored six-straight
points over the last minute and
a half of the game, including the
game-winning layup with seven
seconds left. All six points came
off drives to the basket, and all of
them were made over defenders
much taller than Boylan.
"She's a kid that has the abil-
ity to get down in the paint and
score iton anybody," Borseth said
after the game. "Doesn't look like
she can do it, but she is very good
around that basket, and she put
them in tonight."

Someone who thinks she is
5-foot-7 would defer to a team-
mate in that situation. Someone
who thinks she is 5-foot-7 would
not have enough confidence to pull
off such a series of events.
Someone who thinks she is
5-foot-7 does not take it to the bas-
ket three times in a row, making
all three shots, to give her team
the lead in the last seven seconds
of one of the most important
games of the season. For Court-
ney, though, ignorance isbliss. She
thinks she is tall. She plays like she
is tall. She is tall.
+4+
After finishing third in the Big
Ten, Michigan has exceeded all
expectations set out before the
season. The Wolverines were not
predicted to finish in the top three
by anybody, including the Big Ten
coaches or the Associated Press.
Yet, here they are.
Courtney has teammates who
score more, who rebound more
and who play better defense. She
has taller teammates, more athlet-
ic teammates and teammates who
could beat her in one-on-one. She
has teammates who have earned
more collegiate awards than her,

teammates who get more cover-
age from the press and teammates
with more prestigious accolades.
Yet, the Michigan women's bas-
ketball team would not be where
they are without the girl they call
'C-Boy.' If Courtney didn't step
up like she did after Jordan went
down, Michigan would not have
had the Big Ten season they did.
Chances are, it wouldn't have
earned its spot on the NCAA
Tournamentbubble.
The Wolverines are being led
into March Madness by their
diminutive leader, a leader who
doesn't know she is small. A leader
who did not start until midway
through the season, but a leader
who has been the catalyst to the
success of the Wolverines this sea-
son. A leader who has been wait-
ing for a break since the moment
she arrived in Ann Arbor, and is
taking advantage of the one she
has been given.
"Since I got here, I have been
preparing for this," Courtney
said. "I can't tell you," her voice
trails, as she thinks of all those
hours in the gym, "A lot of people
on our team put in hard work,
but I think that there are certain
people on our team who have put
in more, and I think I am one of
those people. I have just want-
ed to get to this point so badly.
I loved my role coming off the
bench, but Lhave always wanted
to be on the court."
+4+
During a game against Indiana
at home, Courtney gets the ball in
the post, feeling the defender on
her back, waiting to make a move.
"Don't post up, you're too
short," an elderly fan next to press
row says.
Right on cue, Courtney spins
to her left, goes up strong on the
right side of the rim and flips the
ball under the net and over the left
side of the rim. The fan throws her
hands up in wonder, smiling and
clapping. Just one more doubter
proved wrong - not the first and
certainly not the last.

After the game and the post-
game meetings, Courtney pulls
on a warm-up shirt and runs back
onto the court. Even though she
just scored 14 points, she doesn't
want to stop playing.
She has made it, but she isn't
satisfied. She worked then, she
works now, and she will continue
to work in the future. After all, in
every city at every school, there
will be one person who thinks
she is too short. One person who
doesn't think she can succeed,
one person who thinks Courtney
is headed right back to the bench
when the Wolverines get healthy.
She shoots around, just her and
the basket, amid the stragglers
who haven't left the arena yet.
There may be some people milling
around, but in Courtney's mind,
she is alone.
She is back in the basement,
void of all thoughts and emotions.
It's just her and the basket again,
just like old times. She can see no
one, hear no one, and can see noth-
ingbut the basket and the concrete
behind it. The sound of the bounc-
ing ball reverberates throughout
the gym, and it gets louder and
louder as the stragglers begin to
trickle out. She really is alone.
She dribbles to the free throw
line, pauses, takes a deep breath
and launches a shot at the rim.
This is a rim that doesn't dis-
criminate against a ball shot from
the hands of an undersized point
guard.
A rim that does not have an
opinion on whether Courtney
Boylan has the physical tools to be
a Big Ten point guard. A rim that
doesn't care what doubters say,
because this rim will accept a shot
that has enough will behind it, no
matter if the shooter is 5-foot-7 or
6-foot-5.
A rim surrounded by a vast,
empty space, poorly light, seem-
ingly never finished.
Courtney is back at home in
the basement, unaware she has
becomethe starting pointguard at
the University of Michigan.
Even when she has invisible
defenders, every shot matters.

Wednesday, 2011 The Statement 3B
Jn the mornings, I must traipse to the bathroom. There
I'll be, every morning, laboriously shaving my legs or
curling my eyelashes. I have twenty minutes to become
in control and composed. I must be judicious about my flaws-
in order to protect myself. I have learned by heart the num-
ber of freckles on my cheeks and the precise angle created by
my protruding left thigh and it seems like I have been staringa;
at my reflection in the mirror since I graduated college and
couldn't find a job. The way my armpit skin folds into itself is
beginning to make me anxious. The negative space between
my legs has decreased, and so has my self-worth.
I am a freelance model, now. Mostly, I do nail-polish
1dvertisements. There is a lot of pressure in my industry,
especially due to my extensive interaction with the leg mod-
els because they are so beautiful. Yesterday, after a photo-
shoot, I encountered Linda Holtz putting on her lipstick in
the pink bubble-wrap bathroom. I called it that because the
tiles had these sort-of three-dimensional rounded edges like
they were full of something even though I knew they were
full of nothing.
Linda was pouting in the mirror, not paying attention
to me and the water was running. I was staring at her legs.
Her knees looked like Salvador Dali's elephants' but maybe
slightly more bony, if you can believe that. They tapered off
into miniature tree trunks with vines and veins. The way
things worked was, our photographer, Michael, took sepa-
rate pictures of my foot and her leg. She is known for her legs, n
and I have been told my toes look like dainty cream-puffs.
Afterward, the photos go through a process that is called, in
technical terms, "editing." Mine and Linda's collaborative
efforts sell a lot of nail-polish.
I am a happy, well-adjusted person, according to my thera-
pist, who told me a few weeks ago, and last week, that it is
completely normal, and even desirable, to cry every day. I find
myself following her advice often. My parents' insurance will
run out in a few months when I turn twenty-six, so I might as
well take advantage of the opportunity for self-improvement
afforded by my tendancy to impulsively binge and violently
purge. This is the second Ph.D. named Kelley who has told
me what my feelings mean. I resent her less than the first Dr.
Kelley, mostly because I don't have as much energy to fight
her. I am too busy being photographed. Did I mention, last
week my feet appeared in Teen Vogue?
The anger that fueled my vigorous protests against being
normal in my late teens and early twenties has dissolved and
dissipated, so that now my anger is nothing more than a vile
odor lingering above my head. My head has not become qui-
eter, but I never talk back anymore. I can't muster anger. It's
much easier to contain things. But actually, yesterday after-
noon, Melvin and I had a argument that sent me fleeing to
the bathroom.
Outside the bathroom, Melvin was inevitably sitting and
waiting. He rested in his reclining chair as I peered at my
reflection in the mirror behind a closed door, pulling at the
skin on my stomach, turning sideways and sucking in, step-
ping on and off the forbidden scale that I keep hidden under
piles of towels and empty Lysol bottles in the linen closet
Melvin was finishing a crossword puzzle. "We have to go,
Diana, are you almost done in there?" He tapped his pencil
rhythmically, furrowing his brow and looking out the win-
dow as the son crouched behind a tree that was embarrassed
by his mis-directed attention.
Then I wretched, wanting to rid myself of anything and
everything. And when it was finished, my self-loathing, my
scream for help, I stood. And before any waves of anger
broke, there was be relief because any bad feelings had been
eradicated and flushed away. But then National Public Radio
sounded from the other room as I applied soap to my middle
and pointer fingers, scrubbing harshly as "All Things Con-
sidered" buzzed from where Melvin sat so I officially knew
that it was 6:30 and we were going to be late for my public-
ity event. You'd be surprised how quickly people can iden-
tify me based solely on my toenail shape. I swallowed my
bubbling anger, gargled, and spit contempt down the silver
drain. It's more appropriate to keep things in, I thought. A
two-inch piece of wood separated the two of us, and it might
as well have been seventy-four miles of barren land because B A+ ,
he really didn't want to know what was going on behind the
bathroom door. It's a personal thing, he might think, I really
don't have any business being interested.

E J quit you three or four days after I quit smoking for
e rV y h ~~ n Zthe first, last, and ill-advised time. The two are highly
interrelated. Another three or four days and I'm stand-
ing in your kitchen in an ethereal haze of grey and blue,
watching reruns of a vampire show on HBO. You come
W .a s around the corner into the room, open up the fridge, and
dig out a bottle of water. I crawl to your back, wrapping my
arms lazily around your thin frame, and, peering over your
*a i ushoulder, suppress a smile at the bachelor pad mix of condi-
Bea utif U Iape legyufr;e ooigmpyn saepan
ments, a half-gallqn tub of salsa, and two slightly bruised
log away your predilection toward fast food. These things
should not attract me, much less hold me here.

Three or four hours later and the navy blue midnight drips
across your pale body where it lies draped across the bed.
The light swells and fades, ebbing like the Adriatic, crash-
ing over hollowed out places, pointing out traces of ribs, a
thin, oval belly-button, two hips, and all the human body
parts twisted out of place by you. You leave and return with
one of the bruised, crimson apples, rolling it across my col-
larbone, down the valley of my stomach, before pulling it to
baby's lips and biting in. I memorize the blank, white walls
of your room, empty but for a bed with thin, white sheets,
a table lamp, and an analog clock. While you were gone, I
drew an infinity sign over the twelve on your clock. I don't
think it will wash off.

When.the World Gets Wise
By Nazifa Islam
IF THE WORLD GETS WISE
DECIDEWS IT OES ANT TO
FALL

Just a Cousin
By Erin Carney
What I will never forget is the green carpet in your
room, which would later hold your vomit. And your
walls. Those dark green walls. I remember star-
ing at them for the first time, wishing I had a favorite color.
I remember you playing music for me, the Euro-techno-pop
bouncing through the line of light between your blinds, diving
down through the dark air, and slowing as it moved through
the thick Florida humidity. I remember sitting there listening,
looking at you and the green walls and the Star Trek figurines
and the cases upon cases of CDs, wishing someone would teach
me to love music as much as you did. I remember sitting on
the floor in front of your TV, the channel choice deliberately
chosen, and you pointing to the screen, looking back and forth
from my face to the woman on the show (gauging my reaction),
saying a few times, "You know that's a man, right?" And me
looking back and forth from your face to the woman on the
screen, saying curiously, "That's weird."
What Iwill never forget is how red became my favorite color
after that. How I compulsively listened to music after that.
Those things you taught me then. But now I've learned to hate
that I called it weird, and I spend hours studying my shame
over that eight year old girl, the twelve year old, the nineteen
year old. Why didn't we help you. You gave me color and music.
Why didn't we help you. It's only been two years of my life I've
served, and I'll spend the rest of it doing penance for you. See,
look at that: you're not even here and once again you've rewrit-
ten who I'll be. Why didn't I help you. Now I wander the streets

#* *9

obsessively watching the lives of others, repeatedly offering
my help, and permanently waiting on standby. You've taught
me that.
"We watched this video in biopsychology about how one
twin brother had soldiers and weapons all over his room while
the other had Barbies and dolls and pink and frills. They were
talking about how already you could tell one's sexual orienta-
tion so early. You know, because of the Barbies and the rest-"
"-like Michael," dad said, smirking over his plate. I remem-
ber he looked up, opened his mouth, and forked in another
corner of his chocolate cake. Mama kicked his fifty-three year
old knee underneath the table. The one that had the screw in
it. If grandpa had been at that dinner, he probably would have
kicked him a lot harder (wouldn't you agree?). It seems the
faces in that family picture from 1994 have remained static;
you've had no effect on them. Still negligent and indifferent.
Like I was to you. Like they are now to me (because you were
just a cousin). That dinner I remember a shockwave through
my brain as your name bled through every synapse. Looking
out at September, I realized I hadn't heard your name since
April. I wasn't able to say it again until November, but even
then it seemed like the most difficult word to expel. Everything
had gone blank by then, inexplicably erased, and I had forgot-
ten your green room, Star Trek, rural Florida, and RuPaul.
And now that you've left me alone here, heavy with grocery
bags of regret in each of my hands, the plastic twisting around
my fingers cutting off the circulation, my muscles too under-

developed to cope, I wait for the same thing for which you
waited: help. Only now am I noticing how the trestles that prop
up daily life are brittle, how it's just the neighbor's face behind
Santa's beard, and re-reading that Thoreau line over and over
and over: "life of quiet desperation." Now, just like you, I lose
something every time I talk to someone, begging in my head
that they just ask one question about me (about you), but they
don't. They only stick a spare dollar in the cup but don't make
eye contact. I'm sure you knew that feeling well. How did you
make it so long knowing that all of the conversations, the rela-
tionships, the family and friends-knowing that all of that was
just small talk? How did Iever expect you to make yourself feel
better, when you discovered that the secret behind it all was
that no one really cared if you got better or not?
I saw that shade of green on the streets not too long ago, and
I thought about your room, empty now with only the imprints
of furniture on the carpet, a few remaining tufts of dog and cat
hair floating in the air. I sat myself down on the faded green
carpet and looked around, wondering how I'm supposed to
carry on knowing that secret you taught me. My life seems so
empty now, just like this room, just like yours was. Where the
hell is everybody? Did you ever figure that out? I can't see you
and I've forgotten your scent, but I can still hear those songs.
Maybe you left behind music deliberately to help me get along.
I can't play it just yet, but I still listen for now. I cling to its
sound so desperately for now. And maybe you left me that to
help me rebuild, a small inheritance to keep me alive.
