Students visit
Washington, D.C.
to promote the
Energize Africa Act
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
The nation's capital had its taste
of some of the University's lead-
ers and best earlier this month
when Music, Theatre & Dance
junior Arian Shaw-Obasogie and
LSA junior Robert Dickinson lob-
bied Congress to pass the Energize
Africa Act, which aims to help pro-
vide affordable electricity to sub-
Saharan Africans.
Shaw-Obasogie and Dickinson
were chosen to visit Washington,
D.C. for a two-day "Power Trip"
after being the top letter senders
this summer as part of the ONE
Campaign's Power Project. The
Power Project was an initiative run
by the ONE Campaign, an interna-
tional advocacy organization with
the goal of eliminating poverty by
2030, to raise nationwide support
for the act.

If passed, the act could bring
electricity to more than 50 mil-
lion people in sub-Saharan Africa.
Shaw-Obasogie said better access
to electricity would help combat
the Ebola crisis and improve infra-
structure in the region.
Both Shaw-Obasogie and Dick-
inson promoted the act this sum-
mer through the Power Project.
Dickinson sent Congress 315 let-
ters and Shaw-Obasogie sent in
the second-highest number of
responses by recruiting more than
400 letters.
The act was passed in the House
of Representatives in May, but has
yet to be passed in the Senate. The
ONE Campaign is pushing for the
Senate'to consider the act before
the end of the year, or it will need
to be reintroduced to Congress.
During their time in Washing-
ton, Shaw-Obasogie and Dick-
inson met with Sens. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.) and Debbie Stabenow
(D-Mich.). Shaw-Obasogie also
met with congressmen from her
home state of Florida.
Shaw-Obasogie said attending
the D.C. Power Trip was the sec-
ond step in the push to get the act

Event informs
students of
research initiatives
By LARA MOEHLMAN
For the Daily
The weather Sunday was
ideal, to say the least. But mem-
bers of the University's chapter

of the American Meteorologi-
cal Society could've predicted
its beauty days before.
Members of the Meteoro-
logical Society came to the
Diag Sunday to teach passers-
by about the field of meteorol-
ogy. Society members hosted
the event as part of an outreach
effort to expose students
and community members to
research efforts currently

underway at the University, as
well asother institutions.
Engineering graduate stu-
dent Justin Tsu co-organized
the event with a fellow club
member Engineering senior
Barbara Doyle.
"There's so much more to it
than just (weather) news and
rocks falling from the sky," Tsu
said. "In general, meteorology
is all about applied physics of

the atmosphere. It's how wind
moves - it's how the resulting
movement of wind can cause
different types of weather."
About 10 student and non-
student organizations joined
AMS on the Diag with infor-
mation, demonstrations and
models. Other participat-
ing organi ations included

With historical

Evolving organization
aims to serve
each generation of

and MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporters
Bound volumes of The Mich-
igan Daily line the bookshelves
of the editorial conference
room - others lie in stacks on
the floor. Still, more fill cabinets
behind the news desk. The edi-
tions date back to Sept. 29, 1890,
the first day of production as a
newspaper.
The Daily enters its 125th
year of existence Monday, and,
with that anniversary, the paper
celebrates a longstanding tradi-
tion of fostering student jour-
nalism, serving the University
community and covering the
stories that matter not only on
campus, but also in Ann Arbor,

the state of Michigan and even
the nation.
In the first edition, the Daily
ran a story about the rugby
team's upcoming season, an ad
for fraternity pins and notes
from faculty about new cours-
es in foundry work and water
analysis.
Over the subsequent 124
years. the Daily has covered
integral parts of this campus'
history.
The Daily witnessed the
terms of 12 of the University's
14 presidents. And it has been
the first to report on important
scientific breakthroughs, like
the announcement of the polio
vaccine.
The Daily has written about
the impact of Supreme Court
decisions stemming from the
University's admission poli-
cies and covered anti-war and
anti-draft protests during the
Vietnam War, as well as the
experiences of a student jailed
during one.

that Michigamua was all male at
the time.
"Michigamua does not violate
Title IX because Title IX has no

Limnology and Ecosystems
Research, the National Oceanic

tion - which includes with the
Great Lakes Environmental
Research Lab - the Michigan
Solar Car Team and the National
Weather Service of Detroit/Pon-
tiac.
Rackham student David Ben-
son-Putnins said he came to
WeatherFest to recruit students
for the Solar Car Team. The team
recruits members studying in
the Department of Atmospher-
ic, Oceanic and Space Sciences
because they are equipped with
a background in meteorology
and can help predict the weather
for a five-day race.
"How fast the battery empties
depends on how fast we drive
and how much solar radiation we
get," he said.
Each booth offered a different
perspective on meteorology.
Engineering graduate stu-

dent Nathan Boll represented
the Cyclone Global Navigation
Satellite System project on cam-
pus. Boll, a NASA ambassador
involved in science education
and outreach for NASA pro-
grams, said CYGNSS is "record-
ing GPS signals reflected off the
surface of the ocean that will tell
us about the wind speed inside of
tropical storms from space."
"Part of this public outreach-
activity is to educate people
about the opportunities for
research that are going on here
at the University of Michigan
and the surrounding area, but
also the impacts of NASA sci-
ence on our local community,"
Boll added.
Boll said the data collected
from CYGNSS would allow
researchers to build better
computer models to predict the
path and strength of hurricanes
before they make landfall. Such
technology could help keep peo-
ple safe by providing more accu-
rate weather warnings.
University alum Andrea
Reynolds, outreach workshops
manager for the Ann Arbor

Hands-On Museum, explained
the function of the infrared cam-
era at her booth.
The camera highlighted
the coolest and hottest places
on your body. She said meteo-
rologists use these cameras in
weather satellites to find out
"where storms are ... and how
high clouds are in the atmo-
sphere."
University alum Rich Poll-
man, the warning coordination
meteorologist at the National
Weather Service of Detroit/Pon-
tiac, said he came to WeatherFest
to support AOSS and to teach
people "how to be prepared for
severe weather and how to get a
hold of that weather information
so that they can act in times of
emergencies."
Pollman, a graduate of the
AOSS class of 1992, said he
enjoyed speaking with members
of the AOSS department about
what it is like to work for the
National Weather Service.
"It's always fun to come back
here and help out the old depart-
ment and see the new students
that are here."

Health-resources
increasingly
strained in west
African country
MONROVIA, Liberia (AP)
- Doctors are in short supply.
So are beds for patients. Six
months after the Ebola outbreak
emerged for the first time in an
unprepared West Africa and
eventually became the worst-
ever outbreak, the gap between
what has been sent by other
countries and private groups
and what is needed is huge.
Even as countries try to
marshal more resources, those
needs threaten to become much
greater, and possibly even insur-
mountable.
Fourteen-year-old D.J. Mul-
bah was taken by his mother
and grandmother on Saturday
in desperate pursuit of a cov-
eted bed at the Ebola clinic run
by Doctors Without Borders in
Monrovia, Liberia's capital. Too
weak to stand, he was put into
a taxi with his backpack and a
bucket for vomit. Now he lay
on the dirt beside the worried
women.
"He's been sick for a week
with a runny stomach," said his

mother, wiping the sweat off the
boy's brow with her bare hands.
"We tried calling an ambulance
days ago but nobody ever came.".
Beds are filling up as fast as
clinics can be built. Ambulance
sirens blare through standstill
traffic. Often there is nowhere to
take the sick except to "holding
centers" where they await a bed
at an Ebola treatment facility.
By 8 a.m. a dozen people who
likely have Ebola are crouch-
ing and sitting on the ground
outside the padlocked metal
gates of a facility with a capac-
ity of 160 patients. Soon a tri-
age nurse approaches, her voice
muffled through a surgical mask
covered by a plastic face shield.
The clinic will take the boy. D.J.
manages a faint smile. Seven of
the 30 beds made available Sat-
urday morning were vacated by
survivors. The rest had died.
Statistics reviewed by The
Associated Press and- inter-
views with experts and those
on the scene of one of the worst
health disasters in modern his-
tory show how great the needs
are and how little the world has
done in response. Some foreign
medical workers have bravely
fought on, a few even contract-
ing Ebola themselves as they
cared for patients. Experts warn
that the window of opportunity

yfillas
reign ai
to snuff out the dreaded disease
may close unless promises of
additional assistance immedi-
ately become reality.
The existing bed capacity for
Ebola patients in Liberia, Sierra
Leone and Guinea and Nigeria
is about 820, well short of the
2,900 beds that are currently
needed, according to the World
Health Organization. Recently
737 beds were pledged by coun-
tries. Yet even after the prom-
ised treatment facilities are
built, they will still be at least
2,100 beds short.
The shortage of health work-
ers is also great. WHO has
estimated that 1,000 to 2,000
international health workers
are needed in West Africa. More
than local 200 health workers
have died of Ebola trying to save
patients, complicating recruit-
ment efforts.
Doctors Without Borders,
which has more Ebola clin-
ics than anyone, currently has
248 foreign aid workers in the
region.
President Barack Obama has
ordered up to 3,000 U.S. mili-
tary personnel to West Africa to
train health workers and build
more than a dozen 100-bed field
hospitals, including reserved
sections for infected aid work-
ers in Liberia.

conservative grassroots organiza-
tion, - and other similar corpora-
tions, labor unions and nonprofit
organizations - citing them as an
infringement of First Amendment
rights. The nuns warned that this
lack of transparency can endanger
democracy by indirectly influenc-
ing voters with money.
"Money can affect politics, but
only people have the vote," Camp-
bell said, "What we're trying to do
is wake people up ... They buy ads,
they try to confuse us and so many
of us are getting depressed, so I
realized that if we don't vote, we
are going to lose our democracy."
The tour hit Michigan's major
cities, including Kalamazoo, Flint
and Ann Arbor, and the sisters will
be in Detroit on Monday. In their
10 state tour, they kicked off in Des
Moines, Iowa at an event in which
Vice President Joe Biden, who is
also Roman Catholic, offered his
support to the sisters and organiz-
ers.

Following the opening event,
the New York Times reported dis-
cord among bishops and the Vati-
can concerning the strategy and
actions of the sisters involved in
the Nuns on the Bus movement.
While the sisters stress social
justice and political action, they
spoke little about church teach-
ings.
Despite holding support from
Biden, there is disagreement over
whether the organization has
official support from the Vati-
can. Pope Francis, the head of the
worldwide Catholic Church, has
not clearly articulated his stance
on political action undertaken by
members of religious orders.
This year's tour has been orga-
nized to include sisters from each
state they are touring. These nuns
are particularly active in their com-
munities, and ride with the group
during the extent of the tourof their
state.
Sisters from Michigan in atten-
dance included Sr. Nancy Sylvester,
president of the Leadership Confer-
ence of Women Religious;;Sr.Linda
Werthman, University of Detroit
Mercy Board of Trustees member;

and Sr. Carol Coston, the first direc-
tor of Network, a national Catholic
social justice lobby group thatorga-
nizes Nuns on thefBus.
"I feel very passionate that we
have to get out and encourage
people to vote," said Sr. Mary Ellen
Gondeck, a justice coordinator for
the Sisters of St. Joseph of Caron-
delet. "They have to learn, under-
stand the issues, and vote for the
person they believe best will carry
forward what is best for the com-
mon good, and then they have to
hold them accountable."
Political action and mobilization
is and has become more prevalent
amongsisters, despite the reported
pushback by some Vatican officials.
Many congregations have cre-
ated "justice teams," which often
address political and social equity
and to offer hope, and some of the
sisters in attendance participated
in a movie titled Band of Sisters,
which follows sisters fighting for
the rights of immigrants, among
other political and social issues.
The Nuns on aBus tour will con-
clude in October, completing more
than 60 events throughout the
nation.

As Danielle, Markowitz chat-
ted up other potential new mem-
bers, discussing everything from
fashion to parties.
"Did you guys go to splash
bash?" Danielle said. "I went to
splash bash and I woke up in the
morning and I was all red and I
call it the splash bash rash."
Rho omegas, the sorority sis-
ters who help facilitate rushing,
told Danielle to leave the prop-
erty during the rush process.
"I'll call the police," one said in
the video.
"I'll call my daddy," Danielle
retorted. "Do you know how
wealthy he is? We are upper mid-
dle class."
Markowitz came up with the
idea after talking to friends in
Greek life last semester.
"I always thought that guy rush
is very relaxed and allows you to
focus more on meeting the broth-
ers and being yourself, but with
girls, at least in the beginning, it's
almost like putting on a show and
it seems very fake," Markowitz
said. "Maybe that's not fair to say
because it's not completely like
that, but that's how it seems from
an outside perspective."
While many wondered if he
was using this video as part of a
larger social commentary regard-
ing the Greek community, Mar-
kowitz said the only motivation
behind this project was to have
fun.
"I really just wanted to mess
with people and have some fun
with this whole idea," he said.
"When we went into this, I
thought, 'if no one likes this at
least we'll have fun doing it,' but
fortunately people have liked it."
Nevertheless, his jokes about
sex, socioeconomics and the dra-
matic antics of rush have drawn
some controversy. In the video,
people had mixed reactions, with
taking offense to Markowitz's
comments, while others played
along or fought back laughs.
"Some people flipped out and
were going crazy about it, which
I thought was funny because it

shouldn't be such a serious pro-
cess," he said. "It's supposed to be
about fun and meeting people and
joining a sisterhood that's going
to last for the next four years, but
people do and that's where you
get these funny reactions."
Markowitz noted one comment
in his video that pokes fun at
the Kappa Kappa Gamma soror-
ity, when he said he heard it was
nicknamed "Visa Visa Master-
card." He said it was written as
part of Danielle's character, who
he portrayed as "an oblivious
freshman girl who only knows
the stereotypes."
"I think some girls got mad at
first because they thought I was
attacking them or their soror-
ity specifically or that I was only
doing this to them," he said. "By
going to all the houses, I just
wanted to get a reaction from
everyone altogether, and not
make any generalizations."
Despite enjoying the pro-
cess, Markowitz said there was
a moment when he thought he
might have gone too far.
"I had a breakdown before we
got to the last house that no one
knows about," he said. "I was real-
ly afraid of making people mad, if
people had been mad I would have
felt really bad, and all my friends
there (said) you have to finish this,
so I'm really happy I did."
It was Markowitz's first video
and first time using a body mic.
Most jokes were improvisational,
and others were collaborative. He
credits his fellow ComCo mem-
bers for a scene where he hand-
cuffs himself to a sorority fence.
After drawing much ire from rho
omegas about his presence, he
starts to chant "Let me rushl"
while sitting on the ground hand-
cuffed.
Markowitz said he plans to
make more videos in the future,
but is keeping his ideas to himself
for now. Danielle, he said, will
probably not be making any more
appearances, though he cannot
say for sure that she is done for
good.
"I don't plan on putting on a
dress that many more times," he
said. "I knew that if this whole
thing didn't go well, then I would
just be that weirdo in a dress."


BIRTHDAY
From Page 1A
Through the best of Michigan
Athletics' accomplishments and
through the worst of defeats, the
Daily has been on campus.
The paper has grown from 8.5
inches by 11.5 inches to our cur-
rent broadsheet size of 11 inches
by 20 inches.
So pick up a Daily, grab a cup-
cake from a Daily staffer on the
Diag today and read the paper
in print and online. Here's to the
next 125.
In the spirit of this milestone,
The Daily reached out to a host of
notable alumni to talk about their
experiences working for the paper.
These include Stephen Henderson,
Detroit Free Press editorial page
editor; Jeremy W. Peters, New
York Times Washington bureau
* reporter; and David Shepardson,
Detroit News Washington bureau
chief.
What was the best part of
workingfor the Daily?
Peters: "It was something that
I, and all the other people who
worked there at the time really
had a great sense of institutional
pride about. It felt really good to
be part of a product that came out
every single day that we helped
shape and were ultimately respon-
sible for. I think that when you're
20 years old, that's something that
most 20- year-olds don't really
have. It was really formative in
that way."
Shepardson: "The friendships I
developed with the people at The
Daily. You have this experience
you share with everyone there. It
is hard enough for professionals to
put on a newspaper every day. The
fact that kids, who are basically
unsupervised, who really don't
have lots of experience ... it is a
miracle that it gets out every day."
Did you have a favorite moment
or story you covered as a Daily
staffer?

Shepardson: "While I was
working for The Daily I was also
working as a freelance writer at
The Detroit News, where I work
now. I was trying to balance sleep-
ing, not sleeping and classes and I
had to cover an event at the front
of Angell Hall. I had been sitting
there taking notes for a while and
was so tired I started to close my
eyes. Long story short, my room-
mates were flipping around the
channels and saw me on the Uni-
versity Public Access channel,
they ended up seeing me asleep."
Henderson: "The divestiture
from South Africa was a huge
deal on campus, the diversity of
the student body was a big deal,
the University was just starting
to move in the direction of things
like a speech code that they were
trying to institute and the code of
non-academic conduct...I think it
was sort of the sum total of all of
those issues, having to deal with
them day in and day out, havingto
make lots of decisions about how
to handle them, it's the sum total
of that experience that I think I
remember the most."
Peters: "The year 2000, when
Bush and Gore were running
againsteach other... Michigan was
even more of a swing state than it
is right now. (Bush) and Gore were
returningto Michiganalot,so that
gave me the opportunity to, for the
first time, as a20-year-old, cover a
presidential campaign. That expe-
rience stayed with me. One of the
great things about the Daily was
that ... the editors always tried to
be very generous in sending you
out on assignments around the
country, if warranted. One of the
things I got to go do was go down
to the Supreme Court during the
first ... the case that was actually
right before Bush v. Gore. That
was one of the things that, again,
I never really expected being able
to do at 20, and definitely gave me
a taste of what I thought I wanted
to do with my career."
What impact did The Daily
have on your career?
Henderson: "The Daily was the
reason that I was able to have the
kind of career I've had now. I pret-
ty much have the same job today at

the Detroit Free Press that I did at
The Michigan Daily 23 years ago.
And I don't think that's a coinci-
dence. The things that I learned
there and the sort of momentum
coming out of the paper because
of that opportunity are what sort
of pushed me into every position
that I've had in professional jour-
nalism."
Shepardson: "I had so many
experiences from covering the
inauguration, to interviewing Dr.
Ruth (Westheimer), covering stu-
dent protests and the presidential
search, really covering an unbe-
lievable amount of news on cam-
pus. It really inspired me to want
to be a journalist when I really
hadn't thought about it before. It is
a wonderful institution that really
no class could ever replicate."
What advice would yougive to
the Daily and/or Daily staffers
moving forward?
Henderson: "I think that
technology is key to The Daily's
future, and actually is a way to
enhance the paper's relationship
with, and the experience of the
students on campus. The Daily
has the opportunity to be much
more engaged, over longer peri-
ods of time, with the students
on campus because of technol-
ogy. I think concentrating on
it - I mean, I think the paper's
done a good job so far - moving
in that direction, that's the right
instinct. That's what will help
them survive for another 125
years."
Peters: "I would say stick with
it ... There's no doubt that I got
more out of The Daily than I did
any class. And that's not to dis-
parage any of my professors, or
the education that I got at Michi-
gan, but again: it was ours. We
really felt this sense of ownership
over what we produced every day.
And I think that staying with it,
as hard as it was - you know,
you're putting in 30 or 40 hours
a week when you're an editor, and
that's not easy to do when you
have class and ot her responsibil-
ities as a college student. I think
it's often tempting for people to
cast it aside. But I'm glad that I
stuck with it for as long as I did."

SAMUEL WEISS I
Police-militarization

A patriot against immigration?

Like many members of the University
community, I found the police response to
the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson,
Missouri, disturbing. Law enforcement's
militarized response to mostly peaceful
protestors made them look less like a
police force than an occupying army. Their
aggressive tactics sparkedprotests around the
country, including on the University's campus.
The issue of police militarization, however,
is not confined to Ferguson. Last week, MLive
reported that a University police officer was
suing the department for improperly using
a Department of Justice grant to purchase
below-standard body armor. Leaving aside
the merit of the suit, why is our campus police
department attempting to buy military-grade
body armor in the first place?
My current employer, the American
Civil Liberties Union, has documented
how America's police forces have become
militarized and the tragedies that have
too often resulted as a consequence. Police
departments do not buy military equipmenton
their ownbutinstead receive itthroughgrants
from the Department of Homeland Security
or Department of Justice, or simply are given
the equipment for free by the Department of
Defense. The federal agencies provide the
hardware with no training and little oversight.
The results can be absurd: small town police
departments across America have acquired
automatic rifles, armored personnel carriers,
bayonets and other objects designed for use on
a battlefield, not our neighborhoods.
A Detroit Free Press investigation revealed
that Michigan is not immune to the national
trend. The police of Dundee, Michigan,
obtained a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected
Vehicle, built to protect soldiers from
improvised explosive devices and weighing
around 30,000 pounds, to serve its roughly
3,900 residents. Lake Angelus, Michigan,
obtained 13 military rifles despite its
department having a single full-time officer.
The consequences of these programs have
been tragic. Police departments with military
weapons increasingly use them not merely for
extreme circumstances but also for mundane
purposes such as serving drug warrants. In
one of countless harrowingexamples,aSWAT
teamin Lima, Ohiokicked down a door to look
for a suspected drug dealer. He was not home,
but the police nonetheless opened fire on

Tarika Wilson, his girlfriend, as she held her
infant son. The infant survived his injuries but
Ms. Wilson did not. In addition to the many
victims of individual errors by militarized
police, their use of military equipment and
tactics undermine public confidence in the
police, which in the longrun is agreaterthreat
to public safety than the rare circumstance in
which military equipment could possibly be
useful.
As is so often true with our criminal justice
system, the burdens of our militarized police
disproportionately fall on the poor and peo-
ple of color. This disparity was on display in
Ferguson and empirical examinations of the
deployment of SWAT teams have confirmed
that their use is inordinately against marginal-
ized communities. African American students
on Michigan's campus, through efforts such as
the Being Black at the University of Michigan
campaign, have recently been articulating the
ways that students of color can still feel like
second-class citizens on campus, among them
being increased suspicion from the police
towards students of color. Equipment that
encourages more distant and aggressive polic-
ing can at the least encourage divisiveness and
at the worst end in tragedy.
The University of Michigan has a legacy of
protest of which we should all be proud. Past
generations of University of Michigan stu-
dents have rallied against the Vietnam War,
demonstrated to end racial segregation, and
pushed the University to fight for affirmative
action up to the U.S. Supreme Court on several
occasions (even if our record once there looks
a bit like Brady Hoke's). In 1968, on the morn-
ing of Martin Luther King's funeral, a group
of University of Michigan students peacefully
chained the doors of the Fleming Adminis-
trative Building until the University agreed
to take steps to make sure African American
students and professors were full and equal
members of the University of Michigan com-
munity. A militarized police department
like the one we saw in Ferguson would have
responded to such civil disobedience with
battle fatigues, grenade launchers full of tear
gas and assault rifles drawn. The University of
Michigan is too good for such a response. We
don't need militarized police.

June 19, The Kojo Nnamdi
show on NPR's WAMU sta-
tion reported on the immi-
gration crisis
that left both
the American
government and
its citizens con-
cerned and anx-
ious about the
influx of wide-
eyed children ABBY
seeking asylum TASKIER
away from their
impoverished
and violent homelands. I remember
sipping on a cup of coffee in my par-
ents' house, reclining on the plush,
blue couch in the family room while
listening to Sheena Wadhawan, the
legal program manager at Casa de
Maryland, outline the tremendous
hurdles that Central American chil-
dren jump in order to cross the U.S.-
Mexico border.
The risks the children endure
laid out by Wadhawan are almost
unfathomable. She says, "rape is
almost ubiquitous for young women.
They're selling Plan B, the morning-
after pill, all around the route, which
girls take in advance, so because
of the high probability that they
will suffer sexual assault along the
way. Kidnapping, assault, murder,
starvation, heat, harassment by
gangs, by various customs officials,
havingto give bribes".
Girls preeminently taking Plan
B, assuming they'll get raped? This
surely made me cringe when I
recalled the countless number of
stories of girls I knew irresponsibly
popping Plan B pills like Pez. I can't
believe that anyone wouldn't sigh in
discomfort or empathetic pain at the
graphic detailingof these conditions.
Those are the only reactions I can
assume from anyone who's just
heard that Honduran gang members
publically dismembered children as
young as 5 years old in order to send
a message of who's boss.
Following this conversation
exposing Americans to another
world of systematic violence, one
taking place on our neighbor's lop-
sided continent, the program brings
various callers on air who ardently

oppose America's absorption of Cen-
tral American children as citizens.
The callers start off with a pre-craft-
ed phrase like, "my heart bleeds for
the children," or, "please don't think
I'm insensitive," but... this ain't
my problem.
Well, while the complexities of
U.S. immigration policies extend
far beyond this situation, which has
recently been quelled by a myriad of
forces, including the more aggressive
attitudes taken onbythe U.S. Border
Patrol, I fully believe that this is
America's problem. When I lived
in Havana from January to May of
2014, I became blatantly aware of
the discrepancy between my initial
perception of U.S. involvement in
Latin America's economic and social
systems, and the reality.
For four months, I'd ride the
Cuban yank tanks all around town
and be blinded by the excessive
number of revolutionary billboards
that stood tall next to the palm trees.
iViva la revolucidon! Long Live the
Revolution! And next to those bill-
boards that so assiduously push the
communist agenda were other, more
disturbing declarations. El bloqueo
es genocidio. The embargo is geno-
cide. I couldn't remember a time
other than in a high school U.S. his-
tory class that I'd spoken about the
U.S. embargo against Cuba. And at
home, it didn't matter. But here Iwas
in Havana, being taunted by Ameri-
ca's incursions, failure to recognize
the need for socialist ideologies in
Latin America and the eventual 1962
embargo that would plague Cuba
with severe economic impediments.
Unfortunately, although the
Castro government is more
dictatorial in nature than it is truly
socialist, the American influence
over Cuba's economy has a lot to do
with Cuban suffering.
The fierce North American
attitude toward Latin American
democracy, however, is not unique
to Cuba. In Guatemala, for instance,
one of the Central American
countries from which children are
fleeing today, U.S. incursion brought
civil war and a 30-year military rule
over the country. In 1954, when the
elected president of Guatemala,

Jacobo Arbenz, proposed land
reform and attempted to seize idle
lands from United Fruit Company,
supplemented by demonstrations
more democratic than socialist,
the U.S. government led a covert
operation attempting to "liberate"
Guatemala from communism.
What liberation meant here was
the maintenance of the U.S.'s unfair
economic foothold in Guatemala.
Not to mention, a strategic political
ploy against Soviet Russia to
maintain capitalism under the
heavy weight of the Cold War. But I
wonder when or how anyone might
know about America's detrimental 1
influence over Latin American
popular mobilism if not through the
insulatedbubble of academia.
Guatemalawas afruit notallowed
to ripen, and Cuba, a ripened piece of
fruit then taken off the shelf. Ameri-
ca's influence over what present-day
Latin America looks like is, like its
operations, covert. But that is not to
say that American influence has not
damaged and extinguished popular
mobilismthat couldhave turned into
positive socialism. Not every social-
ist movement has to turn out like
Cuba. If America is willing, through
the Cuban Adjustment Act, to make
Cuban refugees automatic citizens
of the United States, then why can't
that same privilege be extended to
the Central American children who
attempt the journey to the United
States knowing that along the way
they could be raped and murdered?
We say that we are patriots, and
we proudly accept our national
identities. But how can we claim
to be patriots when we ignore
the historical significance of U.S.
imperialism?
The heavy inpouring of the
children is over, but immigration
from Latin America and into the
United States is ongoing. If your
sympathies are extended and your
hearts are bleeding, but you still
don't think that it has to do with you,
then ask yourself if you area patriot.
And if you are, then this is definitely
your problem.

TREVOR DOLAN I
When students vote, Democrats win

People aged 18 to 29 composed 19
percent of the electorate in the 2012
election. This 19 percent had enor-
mous sway, and 60 percent of them
voted for President Barack Obama.F
Our capacity to affect our country's
political future issignificant, and we
all have a responsibility to acknowl-
edge this capacity by exercising our
right to vote. The right to vote gives
students a voice.
Many students share progressive
values.We feel that nature is a shared
resource that should be protected,
not exploited. We know that
everyone deserves equal treatment,
regardless of their gender identity
or sexual orientation. We agree
that women should be paid as much
as men and that a woman should
have total agency over her body. We
understand that a quality education
is a universal right and that no child
should be penalized because of her
socioeconomic status. We believe
that every person deserves affordable
healthcare and a living wage.
The Democratic Party embod-
ies and espouses these progressive
values. By coming out on Election
Day and voting for Democratic can-
didates, you are voting for men and
women who will fight on your behalf
to craft policies and legislation that
reflect your values. Unfortunately,
it's unlikely that many of us will
make it to the polls this year. In 2012,
64.7 percent of the eligible popula-
tion in Michigan voted, but in 2010
only 42.9 percent made their voices
heard at the polls. Midterm elec-
tions have historically low turnout
because there isn't a presidential
election to draw people to the polls,
and 2014 will be no different.
It is important to understand,
though, that the future of Michigan
depends on this midterm election.
This year we will be electing a new
U.S. senator, as well as a new gover-
nor, lieutenant governor, secretary

of state and attorney general. Every
state house and senate seat is up for
election, as are all 14 of Michigan's
U.S. Congressional seats. This year
we will not be electing a president,
but we will be defining Michigan's
political climate and determining
the composition of the U.S. Congress.
This is an incredibly important elec-
tion for the state of Michigan, and
the significance of your vote this year
cannot be overstated.
Michigan's governor and state leg-
islature develop policies and legisla-
tion with very real consequences for
Michiganresidents. Michigan'shigh-
er-education funding has declined
28 percent since 2008, and Republi-
can Governor Rick Snyder's budget
cuts have resulted in Michigan K-12
schools losing $393 million in state
funding. This past year, the Michi-
gan state legislature passed a law
mandating that a woman must pur-
chase an additional insurance policy
if she wants reimbursement for an
abortion, unless her life is at stake.
This law - dubbed "rape insurance"
because women now have to antici-
pate the possibility of being raped
and purchase insurance before the
assault - is a striking example of the
tangible impact that state-level leg-
islators can have on the lives of their
constituents.
So, the people we elect this year
will pass laws that significantly
impact us. Who do you want to make
such important decisions?
In 2013, Republican legislators
in Michigan attempted to pass a bill
mandating that women undergo
transvaginal ultrasound procedures
(wherein an ultrasound probe is
inserted into the vagina) before
having an abortion. In late 2012, the
Michigan state legislature passed a
"right-to-work" bill that seriously
undermined labor union funding
(Governor Snyder had previouslysaid
thathe would avoid addressingsuch a

"divisive issue"). In 2011, Republican
state Representative Tom McMillin,
introduced a bill that would ban
municipalities from adopting
nondiscrimination ordinances that
include LGBTQ residents. It's clear
that Republican state legislators do
not share our progressive values.
Meanwhile, there are a number of
Democratic candidates and elected
officials who fight passionately
for the causes we support.
Gubernatorial candidate Mark
Schauer has advocated for increasing
K-12 education funding. State
Senator Rebekah Warren, and state
Representatives Adam Zemke, Jeff
IrwinandSamSinghhaveintroduced
an amendment to Michigan's Elliott- 6
Larsen Civil Rights Act that would
ban discrimination based on sexual
orientation and gender identity. State
Representative and state Senate
candidate Dian Slavens has called
for stronger regulation of toxic waste
disposal in Michigan.
The list of Democrats advocating
for progressive values goes on.
Unfortunately, Republicans hold a
strong majority in both houses of
Michigan's state legislature. If we
want to see our state government
advocate for the values that we
support so strongly, we need to
change that. If we want to win back
the governor's seat and the state
legislature, we need to get out the
vote among University of Michigan
students. If you aren't registered *

moment, when Eli Gold (Alan
Cumming, "Web Therapy")
turned with curious eyes to
Alicia and asked her to run
for state's attorney - the very
position her husband held at
the beginning of the series.
This kind of subtle symmetry is
why "The Good Wife" has been
able to improve for five straight
seasons - and the sixth season
premiere is no different.
"The Line" proves that even
six seasons and some major
plots twists in, showrunners
Robert and Michelle King
know exactly what their line
is. The sixth season dives right
back into the scene between
Eli and his Saint Alicia, with
Alicia casually brushing off
any possible chance of her
candidacy, glass of red wine in
hand. Already there is a quiet
shift in character significance
- the show flashes next to
Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry,
! "Gilmore Girls") as he is
walking out of Florrick/Agos,

on the phone with his star-
crossed love. Suddenly, he is
shoved to the ground by two
police officers and taken to
a holding cell, not given a
phone call despite his lawyerly
protestations. Through the
clever reintroduction of A.S.A.
Finn Polmar, the man who was
with Will in his final breaths,
(a tragically shorn Matthew
Goode, "Belle") it comes to
light that Cary is in a bad spot
- arrested for aspisting in the
sale of 900 grams of heroin,
which earns him a bail of $1.3
million.
And then the opening credits
begin. The classically "Good
Wife" extended intro quietly
repositions the men in Alicia's
life. What once was a show
surrounding Alicia's inner
conflict between Will and her
husband Peter, now focuses
on these three men: Eli the
irksome "meheerleader, Cary-
friend and partner and the sly
promise of something more
with enigmatic Finn, friend
and rival. It's a testament to
Alicia's character that despite
the intense loyalty fans felt
towards Will, the crackling
chemistry between her and
Finn is exciting rather than
disappointing.
Though jailed (and at one
point gratuitously shirtless)
Cary is the focus of. the
episode, in particular during a
moment of shocking, suspense-
less violence instigated by
terrifyingly suave drug lord
Lemond Bishop (Mike Colter),
once again he is just a backdrop
for things to happen to. Despite
Czuchry's talents, Cary has yet
to really be given a chance to do
something, instead functioning
as the underplayed Will to
Alicia's Diane. Hopefully with
the new era of Florrick/Agos/
Lockhart he can take on the
more proactive role that Will
once held.

We've played these games
before. We've watched the shows,
read the books and played games of
guess-who until the final third-act
revelation.
The point is that viewers have
much higher standards for crime
shows than they used to. They
need to be surprised, enamored,
disturbed, entertained, intrigued
and drawn in until the very last
scene. We know the game, and we
know the rulesto play itby. Creator
Peter Nowalk and executive
producer Shonda Rhimes have
played as well, and like the
enigmatic Professor Annalise
Keating (Viola Davis, "The Help"),
they play much better than we do.
The show begins with four law
students at a prestigious university,
panicking. They are in the woods

somewhere, trying to figure out
how best to hide all of the evidence
linking them to someone's murder
- the identity of whom is withheld
untilthe very end of the episode.
Then flash back three months
earlier. New student Wes Gibbins
(Alfred Enoch, the "Harry Potter"
series) walks into a class with
legendary law professor and
defense attorney Annalise Keating.
You have to imagine Annalise
and Olivia Pope from "Scandal"
having a Kenobi-Luke Skywalker
relationship once upon a time,
though this doesn't take place in
the same arena as Pope's Gladiators
(so far as we know). Annalise,
however, is far more dubious than
Rhimes's anti-heroine. It's also
what makes her dangerous. She
might have come from the same
house that made "Grey's Anatomy"
but Keating would find her wits
far more matched by the likes of
Claire Underwood from "House of
Cards" than Meredith Grey. Or for
that matter, even OliviaPope.
Onescene involves Weswalking
in on Professor Keating in quite
possibly the' most awkward.
situation you could imagine for
any student. He finds out that
his professor is having an affair
with another man. When she
confronts him about it, she shows
justhowslyshe canbe, convincing
both Wes and the viewer of her
struggling marriage. It's later in
the courtroom, however, when we
find out the affair might very well
be just another tool Keating was


using to manipulate the case to her
favor, exploiting her lover, a cop,
by undermining his testimony and
ruiningthe case ofthe prosecution.
"I want to be her," one of the
students proclaims.
Needless to say, Davis steals the
show. Keating definitely looks to
be one of the breakout characters
of the fall and Davis brings the
performance you'd expect from
an actress of her caliber. Davis
manages to craft a character that's
charismatic, admirable, flawed,
'tough, manipulative, brilliant, sly
and everything else you've ever
felt about that favorite professor of
yours who knows a little too much
to be nice.
The show's still young and has
a lot of room for improvement.
Hopefully, the show chooses to
focus more on Keating than the
students.
However the minor plot
issues aside, Rhimes, Norwalk
and company definitely seem
to have found a great vessel for
the stylized soap and pulp that
Rhimes is a master of forming
into high entertainment. Like
the days of Agatha Christie and
Raymond Chandler himself, this
seems to be a series focused not
on simple whodunnits but on the
underlying foundations for why
and how people commit murder:
love, jealousy, passion and revenge.
As Miss Marple once said, "there's
never anything simple about
murder." Professor Keating would
more than agree.

'Parenthood' excE

Adventure Club was among the many acts performing at Freedom Hill Amphitheater in Sterling Heights last weekend.
Wii lifts 'Twins'

'Saturday Night Live'
alums elevate flawed
dramedy
By BRIAN BURLAGE
Senior Film Editor
In director Craig Johnson's
sophomore effort, "The Skeleton
Twins," the first thing we see is a
man wearing
a mask. It's not B-
a superhero The Skeleton
mask, and
it's not quite Twins
a Halloween AtThe Michigan
mask either. Theater
Rather, as the
manleansover Roadside Attractions
the camera
we see that it's a happy medium,
a seemingly off-brand version of
a Pennywise/Frank Anderson
hybrid that's too endearing to be
scary. And from the first second
of the first scene, the film centers
itself on the idea that people wear
all kinds of masks. Each charac-
ter, however far from or close to
normal, hides behind their self-
constructed fagades, barriers and
lies. For 93 minutes, wall after wall
is built and then breached, until it
becomes cyclical. The real prob-
lem is, in being so determined to
bury their mistakes, the characters
obscure themselves from us, the
viewers, aswell.
Between the two of them, Bill
Hader ("Superbad") and Kristen
Wiig ("Bridesmaids") have 15 years
of experience at "Saturday Night
Live." Theyare, at heart, two of the
goofiest and most original talents
the show has produced, especially


as Wiig's big-haired Gilly and Had-
er's gossipy socialite Stefon became
sideshow staples. Since their depar-
ture from "SNL," the two have
steadily maintained the wacky
friendship that defines their col-
laborative success. "Having worked
together really helped me per-
sonally," Hader stated in a recent
interview,"because I was able to be
vulnerable around Kristen. It was a
new kind of part for me, and it was
nice beingthere withsomeone you
knew had your back and who you
could fail in front of" Wiig added"
shortly after, "And we have a very
brother-and-sister vibe in reallife."
Hader and Wiig play Milo and'
Maggie, a brother-sister team
dubbed "The Gruesome Two-
some" by their father when they
were younger. When we first see
them as kids, they are, like their
father, wearing masks. But they're
happy. Autumn light fills the room
they roughhouse in, and it falls on
their backs as they play outside by
the pool, laughing and giggling
freely. The movie itself keeps this
feel of autumn; a sad air of decay
infiltrates nearly every scene. Their
lives string along like a single pro-
longed Halloween night, filled with
mystery, darkness and strangeness
that each seem, despite the duo's
best efforts, entirely inescapable.
Only when we learn that Milo and
Maggie impose this hardship on
themselves do we truly understand
how farbehindthe masksthey hide.
The movie was co-written by
Johnson and Mark Heyman, whose
work includes "The Wrestler" and
"Black Swan." it's easy to imagine
their creative process - two friends
in a room juggling lines, tossing
them back and forth without hav-


ing a clear sense of direction. Many
of the scenes transpire in this way,
and depend on the dialogue and
the character's subtle energies.
Meaningful conversations build
around seemingly inconsequen-
tial things like long-sleeved shirts,
Halloween costumes and goldfish.
Hader and Wiig's performances
are both thoughtful and heartfelt.
In moments of unease or despair,
they use the gravity of their talent
to keep the scene from falling apart.
Hader, in particular, delivers a con-
fident and powerful performance
as a sexually frustrated (and heart-
broken) gay man, driven to insidi-
ous measures by his own unfailing
desire for Rich (Ty Burrell, ABC's
"Modern Family"), his high school
English teacher. Wiig's character
Maggie, meanwhile, is allegedly
happy in her two-year marriage to.
Lance (Luke Wilson, TV's "Enlight-
ened"), but sleeps with several
"bad" men on the side.
What makes "Skeleton Twins"
so difficult to digest are the char-
acters' repeated, self-aware indul-
gences in the very things that
harm them - and others - most.
These issues comprise so much of
the film's drama, and after several
of them are actually resolved, the
characters simply create new ones.
Their self-involvement and inward
conflict become exhausting. It's like
they want to suffer. They want to
remain within their microcosm of
mutual self-torture. And as strong
as the script and performances
may be, the idea that a brother and
sister, two best friends united by
their unique place in the world,
would prefer emotional turmoil for
themselves and for each other just
doesn't hold up.

After five seasons of tear-jerking
greatness, "Parenthood" has
established itself as one of TV's
warmest
and most
comforting Parenthood
shows.
"Parenthood" hursdaysllpm
is the° kind NBC
of show you
watch after a long day of classes
or on a quiet Saturday night, the
Bravermans perfect company for a
sleepy room with the faint buzz of
activity coming from the hallway.
To use a metaphor that would
infuriate Max Braverman,
"Parenthood" is the television
equivalent of a warm bowl of
soup. Yet underneath the feel-
good family focus, there's a
characteristic dramatic substance
- "Parenthood" doesn't shy
away from the grittier aspects of
family life, like marital strife and
illness. The characters seem real
and the events don't happen in a
vacuum. One Braverman's struggle
soon becomes the entire family's
business, and they must work
through their issues collectively, as
afamily.
The sixth (and final) season
premiere of "Parenthood" sets
up this year's main conflict with
virtuosity and grace. Patriarch
Zeek Braverman (Craig T. Nelson,
"Coach") collapses during a
birthday Vegas getaway and
shows a troubling lack of regard
for maintaining his well-being.
He leaves the hospital against
doctor's orders, gambling on his
health to literally gamble at the
hotel. Showrunner Jason Katims
hinted that one event would tie all
the Braverman storylines together
for the final 13 episodes, and this
is certainly a great one. Zeek has
had a heart condition for a while,
but the possibility of losing the
glue of the family, the stubborn
father they need to maintain the
mythical Braverman icon, could be
one of the most ambitious stories
"Parenthood"hasever told.
Speaking of ambitious, Adam
(Peter Krause, "Six Feet Under")
andKristina(MonicaPotter,"Patch
Adams") are finally ready to open

a

The back of your head is ridiculous,
their charter school for special
needsyouth. Lastseason,Kristina's
sudden decisionto just buildaschool
seemed a little ridiculous, but the
plot has a refreshing urgency once
their son Max (Max Burkholder,
"The Purge") decides he's not ready
to attend schoolyet.
Burkholder is a phenomenal
actor, flawlessly presenting what
it's like to grow up with Asperger's
and the fear that comes along
with never understanding the
motivation behind the other kids'
cruelty. His parents react to his
request for eternal homeschooling
with appropriate respect. They
keep quiet and let him decide to
attend Chambers Academy on his
own terms. Out of everything to
be missed from new episodes of
"Parenthood," the chance to see
Max navigate his teen years (and
his parents guiding him along
the way) will be one of the most
significant losses.
Though "Parenthood" has
touched on pretty much every
family drama trope in the book,
the undercurrent of every issue is
that it's impossible to handle alone.
Amber (Mae Whitman,"The Perks
of Being a Wallflower") tries to
keep her pregnancy a secret, but
confessingto cousin Haddie (Sarah
Ramos, "American Dreams")
is cathartic. Amber can't figure
out whether she's happy about
the pregnancy, lt-alone whether
she wants -to actually keep the

baby. Haddie gives her the sage
advice to spill everything to her
mom, because that's what family
is for - sharing the burden of
personal struggle, helping but not
overstepping.
But aside from all the feel-
good elements of the episode,
"Parenthood" proves it's still
capable of a good gut-punch. Joel
(Sam Jaeger, "Take Me Home")
and Julia (Erika Christensen,
"Swimfan") are stillseparated after
last season. Seeing them apart is
just painful, because it's obvious
that they're perfect for each other,
and Joel is an amazing father. Joel
tries to kiss her in an emotional
moment, and when Julia pulls away
and looks at her husband like she
wishes more than anything she
could kiss him back, it's a poignant
moment.
It's a shame that we've only
got twelve more weeks with the
Braverman, but if this premiere
is any indication, the final season
is sure to be a treat. There's no
shortage of things to smile at
(baby Aida is walking!), but plenty
to provide a fix for melodrama
enthusiasts (literally any scene
with Drew). Whatever happens,
it's comforting to know that the
Bravermans will stand together
and support one another through
it all. Unpretentious and simple,
familiar but never 'predictable -
"Parenthood" is richer than the
best cup of chickennoodle.

It's an expectable approach to a
£ somewhat vague problem: throw
money and time at a show in an
,m attempt to save it from becoming
stale, or in this specific case, attract
industry approval. Part of those
efforts are visible right off the bat.
In lieu of the clunkily digestible
format used in past seasons -
block of sketches + studio audience
interaction/exposition + another
block of sketches - "Key & Peele"
opts to scrap all those bits with the
pair doing live comedy in front of
an audience entirely. Instead, we
get a larger sketch, sprinkled piece-
by-piece into the pauses between
smaller sketches, to give the
30-minute runtime asmoother feel.
The format could achieve what
wf it's intendingto,butinorder to do so,
must lean heavily on the strength of
the larger piece that ties the episode

best, the riffing feels mechanical,
no heart or soul of its own, with the
we rest of the dialogue serving only to
foreshadow more sketches: still the
thumpingheartof"Key&Peele.'

Yet in spite of how disappointing
those interludes may be, they don't
diminish the quality ofthe film-scale
production or writing propping up
the show's otherwise laugh-out-
loud, instantly-quotable ("afternoon,
my octeroon") skits. Last week's
funniest bit involved Key's character
filling in a Black family about what
to anticipate at Cousin Delroy's
upcoming wedding to *gasp*
another man. The scripting and
jokes are expectably crisp though
it's the character-work, carried by
veteran actors in small, pulpy roles
- Lance Reddick ("The Wire")
plays a tobacco-gnawing uncle
dumbfounded he won't be allowed
to break into his own rendition of
"It's Raining Men" - that elevates
the sketch from good to it-has-770-
thousand-hits-on-YouTube good.
Of course, that inherently edgy
premise doesn't hurt. But going
deeper, one always-palpable
strength of "Key & Peele" has been
its focused tendency to lampoon
societal inequalities. It's the reason
why having two people of color
hosting their own show is so
necessary, and ultimately, another
reason why we get a chance to
lighten, enliven serious discussions
about those inequalities in everyday
talk.
The ability to anchor race-
sensitive arguments with its
hosts' volatile chemistry is the
essence of what makes "Key &
Peele" great television - a shining
inkling of what "Chappele's Show"
accomplished. And if the millions
of views their sketches net online
are any indication, the world wants
to watch. So despite that lethargic
parody of "True Detective" used
to string together the whole affair,
despite the growing pains, the
season four premiere succeeds in
setting the table for an intriguing,
expanded new chapter inthe show's
legacy. Oras The Valets would putit,

Response to Morris injury abhorrent, inexcusable

esaw sophomore
quarterback Shane
Morris wobble after
taking a hit to the head in the
middle of the fourth quarter
of Saturday's game against
Minnesota.
We watched from the stands,
the press box and the replays on
TV as he reached for offensive
lineman Ben Braden, who
held Morris upright for a brief
moment. We watched tight
end Khalid Hill motion for a
hunched Morris to go to the
sideline.
We saw running back Justice
Hayes signal to the sidelines
for medical assistance to come
on the field while offensive
coordinator Doug Nussmeier
called for Morris to get on the
ground so his evident injury
could be assessed.
And yet Michigan coach
Brady Hoke said he didn't see
any of that transpire.
We watched as he left Morris
in the game for one more play -
a direct violation of the NCAA
concussion policy:

injury existed, referring only to

m
s

Morris "further aggravating an
injury to his leg" ina statement
to reporters. He added he is
"confident proper medical
decisions were made."
They very clearly were not.
Whether Hoke witnessed
what occurred on the field
or not, it's his job to know
everything that goes on
around his football team,
with the health of players
at the forefront of those
responsibilities.
And so it is the position from

health, immediately.
We do
not condone
someone
who
jeopardizes
the health of the student-
athletes for which he is
responsible. Because if Brady
Hoke cares about his players
and taking his 15 boys and
turning them into men as he so
often preaches, then the first
lesson he should be teaching

is that no win on the gridiron
is more important than their
health.
It's a serious matter to say
someone should be removed
from his or her job, and we treat
it as such.
But after this incident, it's
difficult to trust someone who,
since his introductory press
conference in 2011, has asserted
his job was about preparing his
players for life.
"One of the great things that
this great game of football does
is teach young men life skills,"
he said then.
Hoke has preached
accountability and leadership,
but he showed little of either
Saturday.
Part of beinga leader is the
humility to admit mistakes, and
he failed to acknowledge an
egregious error.
We're students too, growing
and learning like the athletes.
And we were appalled to see
Morris left on the field. We
imagine our parents mortified,
watching someone else's blatant
disregard for their son or
daughter's health.
Because if Morris indeed
suffered a concussion, even a
light bump to the head could
have been fatal.

After the hit, Hoke didn't
even ensure the quarterback
got off the field to follow
basic protocol to check for a
concussion.
There were a number of ways
to get this done: He could have
called one of his two remaining
timeouts. He could have taken
a delay-of-game penalty. He
could have demanded a direct
snap to a running back instead
of having Morris drop back to
pass, again.
We're left wondering who
is responsible for the athletes'
well-being if not the man
in charge. Is it-the best-in-
the-business neurologist
Michigan employs to stand
on the sidelines? Or the
"distinguished" group of
athletic trainers?
Hoke's statement said
coaches "have no influence
or authority" on whether an
injured player stays in a game.
But Saturday, in direct violation
of NCAA protocol and common
sense, they left Morris on
the field, preventing medical
professionals from evaluating
him.
But here's a better question
we're left wondering, one Brady
Hoke himself asked in July.
"Why do you coach? Why do

you really coach? If we're doing
everything we can for 115-
the sons - on our roster, (then
we're doing our job). FootbalPs
only going to last for so long.
The only pressure is, every day,
preparing those guys for life
after football."
And did leaving Shane
Morris in the game, one that
you're already going to lose,
prepare him for life after
football?
This isn't about winning and
losing anymore. It isn't about
hot seats or upholding tradition.
This is about the well-being
of players, and whether they're
prepared to lead a life outside of
football.
Brady Hoke's actions were
indefensible, and we can
no longer stand behind his
employment at Michigan.
It's a shame Dave Brandon
can, though.

They don't celebrate mediocrity at Michigan

In the Crisler Center
parking lot, a group of men
in their mid-60s ate cold
cuts and drahk beer Saturday
morning. Forty-five years ago,
they were Michigan's heroes -
Bo Schembechler's first team.
Forty-
eight
members
of the 1969
Michigan
football team
gathered in
Ann Arbor
this weekend MAX
to celebrate COHEN
the 45-year
anniversary
of their
Big Ten championship and
monumental defeat of Ohio
State. They spent the tailgate
before Michigan played
Minnesota laughing and
smiling, telling stories of their
glory days, which they claim
grow more exaggerated by the
year.
They take pride in starting
what they consider to be
the modern era of Michigan
football. They're the ones
who survived Schembechler's
first training camp, the one
where he hung the "Those who
stay will be champions" sigh.
They toppled undefeated and
top-ranked Ohio State, even
though nobody gave them a
chance. Starting quarterback
- Don Moorhead tells a reporter
his team beat the Buckeyes,
not upset them. Schembechler
made sure they had no doubts
they could win the game.
They speak lovingly of
their coach; he brought them
together when they needed him
and still connects them even
after his death.
A sign stretched across
the top of one of the group's
tents reads, "'69 Bo's Boys,
We Stayed." At their 40-year
reunion, each player received
a shirt that says "We Stayed."
This year, they received hats

with the same message.
They come back'to Ann
Arbor to bask in their legacy, to
reunite with old friends and to
remember their coach and some
of their teammates who are no
longer with them. A handful of
the men still live in Ann Arbor,
while some travel from as far as
Arizona.
They wear their Big Ten
championship rings, each with
a big block 'M' facing outward.
The right guard from the 1969
team, Dick Caldorazzo, never
misses a home game, wearing
his ring to each one. Most of
the players consider the victory
over the Buckeyes to be one of
the greatest moments of their
lives.
They stayed when others left,
and they are forever champions.
But it almost wasn't so.
Like the 2014 Michigan
football team, their season
also seemed to be headed
toward irrelevancy. Unlike this
team, they found a way to pull
together.

But the Wolverines were
resolute. They dominated the
second half, winning 35-9.
Then they won five straight
games and didn't lpse again
until the Rose Bowl.
This year, skepticism has
mounted by the week.
That much was
evident by the tailgaters
in the parking lot spaces
surrounding the 1969 team.
The current Wolverines were
2-2, their season teetering on
the brink of disaster, just like
the 1969 team's season once
was. The tailgaters wondered
aloud whether Brady Hoke
was the man to win Big Ten
championships and if this year's
team still had a chance.
Hoke has been resolute that
his team can get the job done.
His players have been, too,
insisting the team is good based
upon what goes on in practice.
The words of 1969 defensive
end Michael Keller about his
own team after five games are
reminiscent of what many of
this year's Wolverines had been
insisting all season.
"We knew we were good,"
Keller said. "We knew we were
good enough to play better
than we did.... From then on,
we just kicked the crap out of
everybody."
Keller had no doubts about
when this year's team needed to
start performing if it wanted to
follow his own team's path.
"Itstarts today," he said
Saturday.
Against Minnesota, this,
year's Michigan team
had its own opportunity
to start something bigger, a
game that could turn around its-
season. The players and coaches
emphasized they understood

the stakes and that the team
could get the job done. The
concept feels laughable now.
Early on, the 2014 Wolverines
followed the pattern of the 1969
team's game against Minnesota.
They trailed, 10-7,.at the half.
But history doesn't always
repeat itself. The 1969 team
scored 28 straight points in the
second half against Minnesota.
This year's team surrendered
20 in a row, 30 if you include
the first half.
The Wolverines were
outmanned in every way, on
offense, defense and special
teams. They did nothing the
champions of the past did. They
showed little fight on the field.
It was a sad chapter in what's
now sure to be a sad season.
People stopped questioning
Brady Hoke, instead screaming
with conviction for his
dismissal, chanting for it in
the stadium. He had decided to
start sophomore quarterback
Shane Morris and kept him
in for too long, to the point
where he could barely stand.
Then, when replacement
Devin Gardner's helmet came
off, necessitating a trip to the
sideline, he put in Morris for

Hoke was the first person to

Morris struggles,
defense sputters in
blowout home loss
to Minnesota
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan football team's
season continued to spiral out of
control on Saturday when it lost,
30-14, at home to Minnesota. It
was the Wolverines' first loss
to the Golden Gophers since
2005 and just their second since
1986. Here are the five things we
learned in Michigan's second
straight loss:
1. The Wolverines are a bad
football team:
Maybe we already knew
this, or maybe we were naive
enough to think that Michigan's
struggles would go away once
Big Tenplay started. Either way,
there's no truer conclusion from
the Wolverines' horrific 30-14
loss to Minnesota other than it's
a bad football team.
From start to finish, the
Wolverines looked unprepared,
unmotivated and lost on the
field. The crowd booed even
louder this week calling for
Michigan coach Brady Hoke's
and Athletic Director Dave
Brandon's jobs. It's hard to
blame them considering the
Wolverines had just 171 total
yards of offense, 12 first downs
- three of which were earned
through penalty - allowed 206
Minnesota rushing yards and
have lost three games in the
month of September for the first
time in program history.
And all this coming at the
hands of a struggling Minnesota
team.
2. Quarterback Shane
Morris is not the answer:
After the Wolverines lost

to Utah last week, it was clear
they needed a change. So the
coaching staff went with backup
quarterback Shane Morris. The
sophomore had a long afternoon,
going 7-for-19 with 49 yards,
one interception and a fumble.
But his struggles went beyond
his numbers. Morris spent
all afternoon over-throwing
receivers and missing targets.
He also sustained a leg injury
in the third quarter, but stayed
in the game. Then, early in the
fourth he was hit in the head,
drawing a roughing-the-passer
penalty. He appeared to be
wobbly and needed to lean on
a lineman to stand. Running
back Justice Hayes looked to the
sideline on Morris' behalf, but
the coaching staff kept him in.
He ended up being carted off
the field at the end, but even
when he was healthy at the
beginning of the game, Morris
was far from the solution to
Michigan's issues.
3. Brady Hoke is a dead man
walking:
Argue what you want, but an
embarrassing loss to Minnesota
all but nailed Hoke's coffin shut..
Michigan has just four wins
in its last 13 games, the most
impressive last year against a
subpar Northwestern opponent
that required triple overtime.
Maybe Brandon won't do
it until the end of the season,
or maybe one more loss like
Saturday's will be all it takes
to do it midseason, but it's
hard to see this administration
retaining Hoke for a fifth year.
4. This team will probably
be missing key players against
Rutgers:
This one is harder to predict
considering Hoke never shares
injury updates with the public,
but junior receiver Devin
Funchess was badly limping and
needed help off the field at the
end of the game. He said earlier

this week that he'll be playing
with an injury all season, but
this could be too much to bear
considering he couldn't get to
the sideline on his own.
Morris also appeared to
have a leg injury, but was able
to manage, until he was steam-
rolled early in the fourth
quarter by Minnesota's Theiren
Cockran.
5. Bold Prediction:
Michigan will win ONE
conference game:
It's going to be a long Big Ten
season if the Wolverines come
out playing the way they did
Saturday. And thus far they've
given fans no reason to think
they'll play any differently.
So, for now, it feels like this
Michigan team is only going to
win one more game.
How can this team win
anymore than one? How can
they beat Rutgers on the road
or Penn State under the lights
if the Wolverines play like
they did yesterday? Teams like
Indiana and Maryland are going
to be a handful for this severely
underperforming Michigan
squad.

Michigan dedicates
field, beats Rutgers
By BEN KIM
For the Daily
With alumnae from teams
one to 41 in the stands for
Facility Dedication Day, the
pressure was heightened for the
Michigan field hockey team to
defend its home field. And the
Wolverines didn't disappoint.
No.14 Michigan (2-1 Big Ten,
7-3 overall) salvaged a weekend
split with a 2-1 win over Rutgers
(0-3, 4-5) on Sunday.
The win came after its first
loss in nearly four weeks in a
2-0 defeat against. Maryland
last Friday.
"The big point of focus was
to stay focused," said Michigan
coach Marcia Pankratz. "To not
get distracted by all the stuff
going on and to play quickly."
The first half was a perpetual
tug of war for control over the
game, though the Wolverines
were able to score early on
their second shot of the game.
Redshirt freshman forward
Carly Bennett scored in the
seventh minute after recovering
a blocked shot from junior
forward Shannon Scavelli.
Michigan was able to maintain
the offensive pressure with
three additional shots, all
coming from penalty corners.
Just when the Wolverines
seemed to have control of the
game, Rutgers came back with
three consecutive corners of
its own. The Scarlet Knights
were able to convert on their
final corner with a goal from
midfielder Sophie Wright in the
19th minute, tying the game at
one. Both teams were unable to
score again for the rest of the
half, despite having a combined
13 shots.

victory
"We have a very experienced
backfield, so I was proud of
them," Pankratz said. "Sammy
Gray did a great job marking
and defending today and (junior
fullback Lauren Thomas) is
always solid. It was important,
because it wasn't one of our best
games. It was an important win
to pull out."
The beginning of the
second half took on a different
progression for Michigan,
as it lost three players in less
than two minutes of play to
penalty cards. Redshirt senior
midfielder Ainsley McCallister,
junior midfielder Jamie Dean
and redshirt senior fullback
Leslie Smith were awarded
yellow, green and yellow cards,
respectively.
"I don't think we've ever
been down three players in
my 20 years," Pankratz said.
"They defended that very well,
and then when you get those
three players back, it's a big
momentum shift."
Rutgers was unable to
capitalize on its° numbers
advantage, getting just two
shots in the second half. The
Wolverines, though, were able
to utilize the "momentum shift"
when sophomore midfielder
Eliza Stein scored the game-
winning goal in the 48th
minute.
Despite Friday's loss and
the good, but not great, play in
Sunday's win, Pankratz was
still pleased with the weekend.
"We tried to have time to
make a couple of adjustments
to help tactically get them a
little bit more aggressive, and
it worked a little bit, but we can
get better at it," she said. "It's a
work in progress. But it's being
able to win those games that are
a struggle that is important, soI
was proud of them for that."

By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS

The stage was set perfectly
for a Maize and Blue comeback.
As the clock winded down in
the second half Sunday at U-M
Soccer Stadium, the Michigan
men's soccer team was staging
its final attack. They were
awarded a flurry of corner
kicks, and the Nittany Lions'
defense seemed on the brink of
collapse. But there was never a

crosses into the back of the net.

score line read No. 7 Penn State

Back lme embraces
5-3-2 scheme in win

Wolverines move
to 4-1 in Big Ten
after shutout of
Michigan State
By SHAWN HEROOR
Daily Sports Writer
To an outsider, a move to a
5-3-2 formation may look like
a conservative switch. But
according to Michigan women's
soccer coach Greg Ryan, the
change in formation will play to
the Wolverines' strengths.
On Saturday, the Wolverines
bought in on his plan en route
to a 2-1 victory over Michigan
State.
The new formation, which
features five defenders across
the backline, looked shaky at
times. The Wolverines were
bailed out with a couple of
great saves by freshman keeper
Megan Hinz, but held the
Spartans to only one goal and
three shots on target.
Ryan credited the center
backs with holding the Spartans
to few opportunities. He praised
junior Christina Ordonez, who
played all 90 minutes despite
battling a sickness.
"Defensively, we really

THE MICHIGAN
DAILY TOP-10 POLL
Each-week, Daily sports staffers fill out ballots, with
first place votes receiving 10 points, second-place
votes receiving nine, and so on.
1. FLORIDA STATE: If you squint
hard enough, Florida State's logo
isn't offensive.
2. ALABAMA: Nick Saban never
would have let Shane Morris back
into the game. Unrelated: He's a
competent football coach.

3.OREGON: With wins over
South Dakota and Wyoming, the
Ducks seem destined to beat every
university along the Oregon Trail.
4. OKLAHOMA: Boomer. Sooner.
* Bye Week. Creativity.

7. BAYLOR: SMU, Northwestern
State and Buffalo. Aggresive
scheduling, Bears.
8. UCLA: An elite public school
that plays football in the Rose Bowl
regularly. A Michigan fan's wet dream.
Is it fitting that we could only loadthe
Cocks logo at 2 A.M.?
9. NOTRE DAME: We would've
ranked Notre Dame higher, but the
Fighting Irish somehow scored just
31 points agaist Michigan.
10. MICHIGAN STATE: The
Spartans beat the Cowboys on
Saturday. Completely unrealistic.
Different continents.

5. AUBURN: Real sad about those
trees, huh?

6. TEXAS A&M: Our Managing
Editor says this line shouldn't
contain anything-overtly sexual.
