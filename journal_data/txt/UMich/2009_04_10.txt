LSA ACADEMIC ADVISING
Students:
Advice too
scattered

Double majors,
pre-med students
report lack of central
guidance resource
By AMY MUNSLOW
Daily StaffReporter
LSA junior Ashlee Mosley
decided to double major in Latin
and political science as a way to
pursue her divergent interests.
Little did she know that there was
no one adviser to guide her on
how to fulfill the requirements of
both majors.
Mosley said while she was gen-
erally able to find information
online to plan her double major,
there were a lot of "loopholes"
in requirements, and she wasn't
clear about which advisers to see
to resolve her questions.
As students in the College of
Literature, Science and Arts like
Mosley choose their classes for
next fall, some feelthattheir advis-
ing needs are notbeing adequately
met bythe Newnan LSA Academic
Advising Center. Major problems
cited by students include long
wait times for appointments, over-
generalized advice and conflicting
information between LSA advisers
and concentration advisers.
Tim Dodd, director of the
Newnan LSA Academic Advising
Center, said that the center isn't
designed to give students guid-

ance specific to their majors, and
pointed to concentration advis-
ers as sources of information for
specific majors.
"It makes the best sense to
train general advisers to know
the whole curriculum and the
vast array of resources out there,"
Dodd said. "A concentration
adviser who can give detailed
advice about that department's
requirements, internship possi-
bilities and opportunities to par-
ticipate in that disciplinary and
departmental community."
Dodd said students like Mosley
have avariety of advisers they can
see, but there is no one contact
person for questions specific to
double majors.
"Students can and should see
all of their assigned advisers -
general, first major, second major,
minor - as they have questions
about certain aspects of their aca-
demic program," he said.
Since LSA undergraduate reg-
istration began Monday, students
with both single and double majors
have reported experiencing frus-
tration with a lack of available
advising times as they struggle to
schedule their classes.
LSA freshman Charles Mark-
man said that while his adviser
was helpful, it was difficult to
schedule an appointment.
"I tried to geta hold of her, but
was four weeks down the line
before I could actually meet with
her," he said.

Downtown theater
must raise $40,000
by next Wednesday
to keep curtain open
By MALLORY BEBERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Ann Arbor's 27-year old, nonprof-
it Performance Network Theatre
is in a race against time. By next
Wednesday, the Performance Net-

work must raise $40,000 to keep its
actors working and its stage busy.
Carla Milarch, the executive
director of the Performance Net-
work, said the theater company
has been suffering from a decrease
in state art funding and corporate
support for the last few years. But
Milarch said the Performance
Network has been able to stay in
business because of individual
donations and special event fund-
raisers.
But with the current economic
crisis, the Performance Network

has seen those donations slip away.
"We took some significant hits in
our last few months in a couple of
key areas and so what that has done
is basically change our revenue pro-
jection for the end of the year," she
said.
To try to compensate for the
decrease in revenue, the Per-
formance Network has slashed
employee bonuses and parking sub-
scriptions, Milarch said. She added
that to eliminate more spending,
the Performance Network has post-
poned the date of its seventh show

of the 2008-2009 season. The show
will be the opener for the 2009-
2010 season instead.
"There are a number of differ-
ent ways across the board that
we've cut budgets and done all the
cost saving that we can do without
making major compromises to the
structure of the organization," she
said.
But it hasn't been enough.
Milarch said to raise the $40,000 by
next Wednesday, the Performance
Network has launched a grassroots

B-School project competes for $25K

MRun set for cross-state fundraiser

Website project to

more exposure
By DAVID TAYLOR
For the Daily
The Ross School of Business
likes to bill its classes as "action-
based learning," in which students
can grapple with real-world busi-
ness quandaries. And for Andrew

Charnik and Jeffrey Richman,
such was the case when they were
asked to create their own business
venture.
The result for the two Ross
School of Business graduate stu-
dents is "Relive" - a business
plan that melds the atmosphere of
live, small-scale concerts with the
struggles of up-and-coming artists
in an online community.
The idea afforded them the
chance to compete for $25,000
to make the business a reality.

Their team was chosen out of
160 teams as a semi-finalist in
the New Venture Championship
competition, which started yes-
terday and will continue through
the weekend.
The competition - which is
in its 17th year - is hosted by the
University of Oregon's Lundquist
Center for Entrepreneurship. It
pits student entrepreneurs against
one another for the chance to win
prize money.

HOPPING AROUND THE GLOBE

Members of campus
running group hope
to cover 178 miles in
less than 24 hours
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
While many students will be
sound asleep at sunrise tomorrow
morning, around 30 University
students will be wide awake, clad
in running shoes, spandex and
maize T-shirts, preparing to run
across the state of Michigan.
The 2009 Race Across Michi-
gan is sponsored by MRun, a
student running club at the Uni-
versity. The event is the first of its
kind at the University, and MRun
members are hoping to make it an
annual event.
The students will be running in
pairs, and each pair will run five
to 10 miles. The group members
hope to complete 178 miles from

ARIEL BOND/Daily
MRun members run across the bridge near the CCRB yesterday during practice.

Detroit to South Haven in less
than 24 hours. The goal of the race
is to raise money for the Girls on
the Run of Michigan, an organiza-
tion that promotes a healthy life-
style for young girls.
MRun has already raised $1,150
for the organization through cor-
porate sponsors, individual fund-
raising and online donations on
the team's website.
Elliott Manzon, founder and
director of the race, said each and
every penny the group raises helps
more girls to participate in the
Girls on the Run program.
Sarah Brewer, co-director of
the race, who was also a coach for
GOTR last year, said she's excited
to raise money for such a great
cause.
"I saw firsthand how donations
were being used to sponsor girls

who could not afford the program
fee and how much this after-
school program meant to them,"
she said.
David Metler, president of
MRun, said the idea for the race
started as a joke when he suggest-
ed the group run across the coun-
try. Instead, the group came up
with the more feasible alternative
of running across the state.
The race will make the group
the first to run across the state of
Michigan, Brewer said.
Participants are divided into
five vans depending on how long
they want to participate, Brewer
said. She added that throughout
the race, they plan to blog and post
pictures on www.raceacrossmi.
com.
Manzon said he's excited to

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
" Layoffs, closures
planned for Detroit
Public Schools
The state financial overseer of
the Detroit Public Schools yester-
day proposed closing 23 schools
and laying off 600 teachers as part
of an effort to consolidate facilities
in a shrinking district that's facing
a projected $303 million deficit.
Robert Bobb said he also asked
the state for $200 million in federal
stimulus funds to improve schools
where about 7,500 displaced stu-
dents would be sent, strengthen
safety and security, and improve
other schools.
"We have the professional staff
in place to ensure that students are
placed in the optimal educational
environment, where safety and
security is at the forefront both on
the school campus as well as in the
community," Bobb said at a news
conference.
The first of a series of town hall
meetings for the public on the re-
structuring plan is scheduled for
April 28, and a final decision on the
plan is expected May 8. Bobb said
some of the laid-off teachers could
return, but another round of po-
tential school closings will be an-
nounced this summer.
WASHINGTON
Obama: Millions
can save money by
refinancing
President Barack Obama says
millions of Americans can save
money by refinancing their homes
and takingadvantage of record low
rates on fixed mortgages.
Speaking at the White House,
Obama yesterday emphasized
that that average rates on 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages have dropped
to 4.78 percent. That is the lowest
rate on record.
Said the president: "People can
really take advantage of this."
Obama touted an increase in
refinancing nationwide as a sign
that federal programs to help hom-
eowners are working.
But he warned people to watch
out for scam artists. He said if peo-
ple offering to help people stay in
their homes ask for money upfront
then "it's probably a scam."

* Winds drive fires
scorching parts of
Texas, Okla.
Gusting winds and dry condi-
tions fueled wildfires across Texas
and Oklahoma yesterday, destroy-
ing or damaging homes, forcing
evacuations and shutting down
parts of a major highway in Okla-
homa.
Firefighters were battling a
12.5-square-mile wildfire in Wil-
barger County that scorched sev-
eral businesses west of Electra,
Texas Forest Service spokesman
Bill Beebe said. The fire also forced
schools in Montague and Callahan

counties to evacuate.
Montague County Judge Ted
Winn said as many as 10 fires were
raging across northern Texas,
where winds were reported at
about*60-mph. A fire at Lake Min-
eral Wells State Park in Parker
* County that destroyed one home
andthreatened SO otherswasbeing
spread by 40 mph winds, county
spokesman Joel Kertok said.
Kertok said crews didn't have
control of the fire and firefight-
ing efforts by air were grounded
"because the winds are so high."

U.S. warship keeps
close eye on Somali
pirates, hostages
Somali pirates and their hos-
tage American sea captain were
adrift in a lifeboat Thursday off the
Horn of Africa, shadowed by a U.S.
destroyer with more warships on
the way in a U.S. show of force.
The U.S. brought in FBI hostage
negotiators to work with the mili-
tary in trying to secure the release
of Capt. Richard Phillips of Under-
h bill, Vt. An official said the bandits
were in talks with the Navy about
resolving the standoff peacefully.
As the high-seas drama
stretched into a second day, the
freighter that was the target of the
pirates steamed away from the life-
boat under armedU.S. Navyguard,
with all of its crew safe - except
for the captive captain.

Obama seeks $83.4B for wars

Increase would push
cost of wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan to
almost $1 trillion
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dentBarack Obamaasked Congress
yesterday for $83.4 billion for U.S.
military and diplomatic operations
in Iraq and Afghanistan, pressing
for special troop funding that he
opposed two years ago when he
was senator and George W. Bush
was president.
Obama's request, including
money to send thousands more
troops to Afghanistan, would push
the costs of the two wars to almost
$1 trillion since the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks, according to the
Congressional Research Service.
The additional money would cover
operations into the fall.
Obama is also requesting $350
million in new funding to upgrade
security along the U.S.-Mexico
border and to combat narcoterror-
ists, along with another $400 mil-
lion in counterinsurgency aid to
Pakistan.
"Nearly 95 percent of these
funds will be used to support our
men and women in uniform as
they help the people of Iraq to take
responsibility for their own future
- and work to disrupt, dismantle
and defeat al-Qaida in Pakistan
and Afghanistan," Obama wrote
in a letter to House Speaker Nancy

tedt U.S. assets and personnel and
conduct anti-terror operations.
The official request was sent
early Thursday evening.
The requestwould fund an aver-
age force level in Iraq of 140,000
U.S. troops. It would also finance
Obama's initiative to boost troop
levels in Afghanistan to more than
60,000 from the current 39,000.
And it would provide $2.2 billion
to accelerate the Pentagon's plans
to increase the overall size of the
U.S. military, including a 547,400-
person active-duty Army.
Some Democrats were not
pleased.
"This funding will do two
things - it will prolong our occu-
pation of Iraq through at least the
end of 2011, and it will deepen
and expand our military pres-
ence in Afghanistan indefinitely,"
said anti-war Rep. Lynn Woolsey,
D-Calif. "Instead of attempting to
find military solutions to the prob-
lems we face in Iraq and Afghani-
stan, President Obama must
fundamentally change the mission
in both countries to focus on pro-
moting reconciliation, economic
development, humanitarian aid,
and regional diplomatic efforts."
But House GOP 'leader John
Boehner of Ohio predicted that
Republicans would overwhelm-
ingly support the request, provid-
ed congressional Democrats don't
seek to "micromanage" the war by
adding a timeline or other restric-
tions on the ability of military offi-
cials to carry on the fight.

CHARLES DHARAPAK/AP
President Barack Obama is applauded by military personnel during his visit to Camp Victory in Baghdad, Iraq,
last Tuesday.

Pelosi, D-Calif.
Robert Gibbs, the White House
press secretary, acknowledged
that Obama has been critical of
Bush's use of similar special legis-
lation to pay for the wars. He said
it was needed this time because
the money will be required by
summer, before Congress is likely
to complete its normal appropria-
tions process.

"This will be the last supple-
mental for Iraq and Afghanistan.
The process by which this has
been funded over the course of the
past many years, the president has
discussed and will change," Gibbs
said.
Last June, Congress approved
$66 billion in advance 2009 fund-
ing for military operations. All
told, the Pentagon would receive

$142 billion in war funding for the
budget year ending on Sept. 30.
The request is likely to win easy
approval from the Democratic-
controlled Congress, despite frus-
tration among some liberals over
the pace of troop withdrawals and
Obama's plans for a large residual
force of up to 50,000 troops -
about one-third of the force now
there - who will train Iraqis, pro-

After six-month decline,
economy is leveling off

FDA reversal OKs

Wells Fargo forecasts
strong profit, Dow
Jones rises nearly
250 points
WASHINGTON (AP) - At last,
after a nerve-racking six-month
descent, the economy appears to
be leveling off.
But don't assume the bumps
are over.
Stock investors, shoppers
and home buyers are less jittery.
Once-frozen credit markets are
slowly thawing. And economic
indicators that had been going
from bad to worse are showing
signs of stabilizing - though still
at distressed levels.
There were fresh signs yester-
day thatthe full force of the reces-
sion may be petering out: a strong
profit forecast from Wells Fargo,
a drop in unemployment benefit
filings and several retailers pre-
dicting solid April sales. On Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrials
rose nearly 250 points.
Still, with unemployment ris-
ing, it will be at least several
months before the country's eco-
nomic engine pops into a growth
gear. Job losses - and the fear of
them - act as a headwind against
consumer confidence and spend-
ing, which account for more than
two-thirds of the U.S. economy.

table, which is what the economy
has felt like since the middle of
last fall, I think we can be reason-

Drug will remain on
market until replaced
by equivalent therapy
NEW YORK (AP) - A liq-
uid morphine painkiller given
by family caregivers to dying
patients can remain on the mar-
ket, federal regulators have
decided after hearing protests
over their decision to remove it.
The Food and Drug Adminis-.
tration had announced last week
that it was ordering manufactur-
ers to stop making 14 medications
including the liquid morphine.
All were developed so long ago
they had never received FDA
approval.
But yesterday, the FDA's Dr.
Douglas Throckmorton told The
Associated Press the morphine
liquid will remain on the market
until it's replaced by an approved
version or some equivalent ther-
apy.
The reversal was welcomed by
experts in hospice care and pain
relief. One doctors group had told
the FDA that last week's order
would "cause extreme suffering
for many patients who are near-
ing the end of life."
The order has not changed
for the other painkillers, at least
for now, said Throckmorton,
deputy director of the agency's
Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research.
The agency said last week that
the unapproved drugs might be
unsafe, ineffective or poor qual-
ity. The order gave manufactur-

ers 60 days to stop making those
products.
The liquid morphine is highly
concentrated. Other approved
forms of liquid morphine are
more dilute, and Throckmorton
said the FDA had thought the
other forms could take the place
of the concentrated form.
But reaction from hospice
experts and others "helped us
understand" that some patients
need the unapproved version,
Throckmorton said.
In interviews, experts said
they didn't have firm numbers on
how many patients use the con-
centrated liquid. But Dr. Diane
Meier, director of the Center to
Advance Palliative Care at the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine
in New York, estimated that it
may be at least 2 million Ameri-
cans a year.
She called Thursday's deci-
sion "fabulous.... It's incredibly
refreshing and makes me hopeful
about our government."
The high morphine concen-
tration is crucial, she and others
said. It allows caregivers to rap-
idly relieve pain by placing just a
few drops in the mouth of a per=
son who has trouble swallowing,
perhaps because of confusion,
lethargy or other conditions.
The more dilute morphine
requires much more liquid, which
could make an impaired person
choke or sputter, or refuse to take
the medication, experts say.
Caregivers can administer the
concentrated solution at home,
where - morphine shots often
aren't a good option.

Shown is the headquarters of Wells Fargo & Co., in San Francisco, yesterday. Wells
Fargo & Co. said yesterday it expects record first-quarter earnings oft$3 billion.

ably confident that that is going to
end within the next few months,
and we will no longer have that
sense of a free-fall," President
Barack Obama's top economic
adviser, Lawrence Summers, said
yesterday.
But Summers, who spoke at the

Economic Club of Washington,
said it was too soon to forecast
how strong the rebound would be
and when it would take hold.
The economy shrank at a 6.3
percent rate in the final three
months of 2008, thef worst show-
ing in a quarter-century.

Judge blocks effort
to turn over Cobo

Motion to appeal
the decision
already delivered
DETROIT (AP) - A judge yes-
terday blocked Cobo Center from
being turned over to a regional
authority that would have brought
a $288 million upgrade and expan-
sion of the downtown convention
center.
But a motion to appeal already
has been delivered to the Michi-
gan Court of Appeals.
Wayne County Circuit Judge
Isidore Torres ruled that Mayor
Ken Cockrel Jr. had no author-
ity to veto Detroit City Council's
rejection of the plan. The council
filed a lawsuit last month chal-
lenging the veto.
"The act (to create the authori-
ty) does not permit a mayoral veto
of a resolution disapproving the
transfer of a qualified convention
facility, and ... the mayor's veto of
the City Council's resolution dis-
approving the transfer of Cobo is
null and void," Torres wrote in the
ruling.
A motion to appeal Torres'

ruling was delivered yesterday
afternoon to the Michigan Court
of Appeals, mayoral spokesman
Anthony Neely told The Associ-
ated Press via e-mail.
The filing may not be official
until Friday morning, Neely said.
Cockrel told reporters Thurs-
day afternoon that the future of
the city and the North American
International Auto Show, which
is held each year at Cobo, are at
stake: He said he believes Torres
"made the wrong decision," and
said a viable alternative hasn't
been put forward.
"There is no plan that council is
offering," Cockrel said.
City Council President Monica
Conyers, who led opposition to the
Cobo deal, said in a statement she
was pleased with Torres' decision,

Doug Fox, senior co-chairman
for the 2010 show, said he was
disappointed with the judge's rul-
ing but remains hopeful a com-
promise can be reached. He said
if all options become exhausted,
organizers may have to consider
whether the show can continue at
Cobo.
"In order to protect the status
of this show, the stature of this
show, we will have to explore any
or all options," Fox said when
asked about whether organizers

would consider a move to a subur-
ban Detroit location.
Oakland County Executive L.
Brooks Patterson, who had sup-
ported the Cobo deal, released a
statement after the judge's deci-
sion saying he planned to work to
see whether the auto show could
be held in the suburbs.
Patterson said hehas no interest
in negotiating a deal that would be
satisfactory to Conyers.
"What City Council has done is
overturn five years of hard nego-
tiation that was Detroit's last best

chance to secure long-term fund-
ing for Cobo Hall and frankly the
North American International
Auto Show," Patterson said.
Torres heard arguments in the
case March 26, but had delayed
issuing a ruling while trying to
facilitate an agreement between
the mayor's office and council. The
act was signed into law in January
by Gov. Jennifer Granholm.
Granholm still believes a revi-
talized and expanded Cobo is
critical, her spokeswoman Liz

A photographic memory
Policy change shines light on the hidden cost of war
More than 5,000 soldiers have lost their lives in the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But for the last 18
years, the Pentagon has barred news outlets from
photographing the return of war dead. As a consequence of
this policy, the American people have been sheltered from
the fact that American men and women are dying. Thank-
fully, the Obama administration has decided to lift the ban
and allow photographs of the returning caskets, provided
that the family members of the deceased offer their consent.
This promising new policy treads the fine line between pro-
tecting military families and informing the public about the
true costs of war. Now it's up to the media to responsibly
report on the consequences of our foreign entanglements.

During the first Gulf War in 1991, Presi-
dent George H.W. Bush banned news cov-
erage of returning war dead. This rule
remained until the Obama administration
lifted the ban in February. The new policy
permits journalists to photograph return-
ing war dead, but only with the consent of
the deceased soldiers' families. Last Sun-
day, the coffin of Air Force Staff Sgt. Phillip
Myers became the first to be photographed
under the new rules.
Although the old policy's stated purpose
was to shield military families from an
invasion of privacy during a time of grief, it
also shielded the American people from the
reality of our losses in foreign wars. Seeing
firsthand the caskets coming home helps
people to realize our presence in the Middle
East has consequences, and will hopefully
motivate voters to select the country's lead-
ership with these realities in mind. This
effect was certainly not lost on Bush when
he gave the order to prohibit such photo-
graphs in 1991. Since then, the lack of photos
in the news has helped to rev up support for
war and hide the very real cost of the wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The most important effect of the new
policy is that it allows the media to more

accurately inform the public. The media
has a right and a responsibility to show the
American people the reality of the govern-
ment's actions. And a government policy
that prevents the media from fulfilling
this vital function is counter-intuitive in a
democracy supposedly based on open and
fair government.
But despite the importance of keeping the
public informed, it's understandable that
the administration's rules strive to protect
grieving families. These families have suf-
fered a tremendous loss, and they shouldn't
be forcibly subjected to additional hardship.
At the same time, the new policy is only an
improvement as long as requiring consent
doesn't become a form of de facto censor-
ship. If giving families a choice results in
another media ban, the policy would need
to be revisited. It's critical that the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan be portrayed in a
comprehensive and accurate fashion.
Distorting reports to promote failed poli-
cies was a hallmark of both Bush adminis-
trations. But with a president in office who
seems to recognize the folly of America's
foreign policy and a populous motivated by
the visible cost of war, there is hope for a
quick end to these wars.

With City Council members
struggling to come to an
agreement on building
heights in down-
town Ann Arbor,
the split seems to
be between those
who feel that Ann
Arbor is plagued by
the threat of mono-
lithic skyscrapers
blotting out the
sun and those who BEN
feel that any oppo-
sition to develop- CALECA
ment projects is
economically unvi-
able. But city zoning projects such as
the Ann Arbor Discovering Down-
town (A2D2) proposal are more than
just about mixingpastoral livingwith
a vibrant downtown culture. The way
we design our cities has a massive
effect on cultural understanding and
on the health of both residents and
the environment.
Making urban growth viable for
smaller communities can be chal-
lenging, but the issues are anything
but new. In the 1916 New York build-
ing code, skyscrapers could only usea
certain percentage of their lot's space
as they climbed higher, and buildings
tapered inward to allow more light to
filter down to street level. Conserva-
tive solutions like that, along with
making sure buildings are spaced far
apart enough to allow light to filter
to the street, improve the pedestrian
quality of a downtown area. Beyond
that, investors shouldn't set up a gar-
gantuan tower in a small community
- having a local Tower of Babel isn't
going to win brownie points with the
local population.
Suburban sprawl in smaller com-
munities also promotes greater socio-
economic divide. Neighborhoods
that are driving distance away from

each other are prone to segregation
along socioeconomic, racial or cul-
tural lines. When inadequate hous-
ing is available near city centers, the
poorest people are often forced to
live farther toward the outskirts of a
community, facing longer and more
expensive commutes. Building up in
city centers creates more affordable
housing, gives people the opportu-
nity to be within sight of a variety of
different backgrounds and promotes
a culture of understanding and a
unique local culture. Those who long
for backyards and quiet can still have
those things - at the cost of direct
access to the downtown area. But it
becomes a choice, not a necessity.
Multi-story apartments of mod-
est size located close to most conve-
niences can significantly reduce the
car culture because they promote
biking and walking as primary means
of transportation. These might seem
like simple energy reduction argu-
ments, but they also affect the health
of residents. Encouraging walking
and biking around town improves
air quality and gives residents more
exercise than communities that
require car or bus travel. Physical
health improves with more exercise
and better air quality, which subse-
quently lowers healthcare and insur-
ance costs. More pedestrians also
reduce safety risks for those going
out alone at night.
In an urban community, green
design can enhance the well-being
of citizens by making indoor spaces
more livable. Better lighting and use
ofspace in residential andcommercial
buildings promotes greater produc-
tivity and mental health. Apartment
living with well-designed buildings
also cuts down on water, electrical
consumption, lighting and cooling
costs. Besides lower water consump-
tion from lawns, apartments with

more efficient climate control and
insulation save considerable energy. 0
By ensuring that there is ample green
space within walking distance of
urban areas, there is a quality of life
and sense of community.
The benefits
of building up
are limitless.
Ann Arbor and cities around the
country have struggled to strike a
balance between established commu-
nities and future downtown growth.
With concerns over quality of life
and environmental impact growing,
cities should be more accepting of
urban development. While ostenta-
tious skyscrapers are probably not
the answer for smaller cities, 18- and
20-story buildings are a modest addi-
tion to urban communities and pro-
mote closer communities.
A developer looking to build up
in the heart of cities like Ann Arbor
should work with the City Council to
determine what fits the population's.
demands the best. But limitations on
maximum height are a disservice to
the city as a whole. No one should
expect a downtown area to turn
into Manhattan overnight. Changes
generally take a lot of time - even
more so under economic conditions
like the ones we face right now. Ann
Arbor will only become a metropolis
if its population fights to create that
reality.

TO THE DAILY:
Vincent Patsy's latest column is another in
an increasingly long line of - frankly - garbage
(Switching thefrequency, 04/07/2009).
Of course I understand the importance of free
press and the practice thereof. In fact, I applaud
Patsy for using the tools available to him to
share his opinions. I simply wish he or someone
else would read those opinions before troubling
the general public with them.
The beauty of this particular column is that it
practically defeats itself. Patsy explicitly defines
the difference between land and capital, and
then proceeds to compare radio and television
waves to a copper mine. Even in the loosest
terms, broadcast waves are no more property as
part of land than an airplane is flying overhead.
As Patsy put it, "capital is the stuff put on to that
space." Radio and television waves are gener-
ated. They do not exist like natural resources.
The "strict" economic arguments fall through
by definition.
As for the argument that parents would make
better mediators than the federal government
- look around. Parents already can't moni-
tor everything their children are exposed to
in today's digital age - how many "To Catch a
Predator" specials do we need to see? How many
kids need to disappear after agreeing to meet
someone they met online? This is not the fault
of radio or television. But it certainly is not per-
fectly defended by parental supervision, either.
The idea of freeing the airwaves from gov-
ernment control is as old as the airwaves them-
selves. The arguments expressed by Patsy are
interesting, to say the least. ButI had hoped that
the right to free thought would have been exer-
cised as liberally as the right to free speech.

TOTHE DAILY:
Jason Mahakian's latest comic is the height
of irony and exemplifies the smug but ignorant
mentality of many in the University community
(Thegreatergood, 04/06/2009).
In it, a "bright" young woman addresses an
archetypal stoner. "We're raising money for
cancer! What are you guys doing?" "Ummm...
smokin' weed, man," the Hash Bash-attending
burnout sheepishly answers. A question to the
reader is posed: "One day, one campus. Two great
causes?" The implication is that legalizingcanna-
bis is frivolous in comparison to fund-raising for
cancer. Nothingcould be further from the truth.
It has been known to science since at least the
early '70s that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is
an extraordinarily powerful anti-tumor agent.
Recent research has confirmed this by finding
that THC injected directly into rat brains shrinks
brain tumors. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
ingesting cannabis oil can reverse even advanced
cancer, as seen in the documentary "Run From
the Cure: The Rick Simpson Story."
Clearly, cannabis is among the most promising
cancer therapies in the world. Unless the Ameri-
can Cancer Society is workingto legalize medical
cannabis and educating people about the power
of THC to reduce tumors, they are probably pre-
venting patients from getting a highly effective,
non-toxic therapy.
Does the young lady in the comic become an
unwitting dupe of those who would suppress
natural cancer treatments? Does our stoner
friend unknowingly represent the vanguard of
the search for a cure? Wipe that smirk off your
face and stop rolling your eyes long enough to
research the science of cannabis as medicine and
find out for yourself.

J 's not easy to write a col-
umn about race relations, as
they directly concern blacks
and whites, even
though the Uni-
versity audience
consists of mostly
white students.
Any ongoing, for-
ward-thinking
conversation about
racial taboos in -
society will uncov- MATTHEW
er squeamish
responses. HUNTER
How comfort-
able are we with
talking about race? How comfortable
are we with the word "reparations" -
let alone any real conversation about
reparation policy - and with the
word "slavery"? Would we honestly
account for our personal opinions
about race relations in a public space?
The answers to these questions pro-
vide insight into the role race plays
on the surface. But instead, racial
dialogue is often watered-down or
held in spaces where anonymity can
be guaranteed (i.e., online comment
forums).
I am certainlynotalways complete-
ly forward. I have strategically edited
out certain emotional responses or
"radical" suggestions for change.
Some might think, for example, that
a proposal for a $4 trillion stimu-
lus package for black community
rebuilding is a bit much, but often it
takes dramatic efforts to account for
dramatic disparities, like consistently
lower-quality education at predomi-
nately black schools. But rather than
trying to satisfy both sides - either
those who ignore race-talk or those
who, like me, bask in racial liberation
glory - it's more important that these
conversations thrive.
An active attempt must be made
to confront the challenges of speak-
ing about racial issues in public. For
the most part, it seems whites have
a harder time talking about race.

Whites are comparatively silent on
racial issues. Though many blacks
seem more vocal about race, there
are blacks that are quiet about race or
have deemed that racial barriers have
been overcome. If we compare these
groups in the context of life experi-
ence and privilege, some truths are
made apparent.
Many blacks live with oppressive
forces every day. Blacks sometimes
face concern when driving in seclud-
ed white rural areas of America or
fear racially motivated police brutal-
ity. And some blacks have to worry
if a noose will be hung for them in a
high school courtyard. It was fear
that motivated the group of black
teenagers called the Jena Six who
were charged with beating Justin
Baker. The Jena Six were angry after
Baker and his friends hung a noose
for black students after previous vio-
lent conflicts. In contrast to blacks,
many whites can go a longtime with-
out considering what it's like to be
oppressed. It's as if silence is a result
of privilege.
Perhaps this can be applied to
silent blacks as well. It seems there
are two "types" of blacks that pre-
dominate the silent scene. However
rare the population of ultra-conser-
vative blacks is, it remains a dominant
influence in politics and the media.
Clarence Thomas and Ward Conner-
ly appropriately represent a white-
endorsed force against progressive
racial dialogue in their consistent
opposition to affirmative action. But
the fact that they are black provides
them little support from blacks -
rather, they are used as leverage for
racial conservatives to cite "excep-
tional blacks".
There are also blacks that choose to
be silent in professional spaces. These
are spaces where the consequences of
speaking out on racial issues leads to
being made an outcast by white co-
workers who are less concerned with
one's racial struggles. When delving
only briefly into the history of blacks

that were or are racially outspoken,
it becomes apparent that they were
either killed off (like Martin Luther
King and Malcolm X) or they were
utterly discredited as racial radicals
(like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson).
Even President Barack Obama can't
actively speak out on these issues. He
was given space for one "race speech"
in response to growing racial con-
cerns and criticisms.
While the above arguments are
simple observations for me, I admit
that they may not be objective. But
one thing we can all see is that racial
barriers, still exist. And instead of
Forward-thinking
dialogue is needed

confronting these issues, we often
turn the other cheek. This is not to
say that white people should suddenly
spew racial opinions loosely to a pre-
dominately black audience. There are
more practical solutions, but I under-
stand they may not be easy.
If black people do complain in pub-
lic space, begin by trying to under-
stand their frustration rather than
by discrediting them. Go to an edu-
cational forum on people of color and
domesticviolence or crime disparities
in the black community. Go talk to
an elderly black woman whose home
has been Detroit for 60 years. Learn
about a different racial perspective
than your own. Let us not be a part
of a post-racial era that has become
comfortable with racial silence but
rather an era that is fueled with con-
versations of greater racial under-
standing.

HBO defies popular

its smart new series

tently at work in
HBO's "The No. 1
Ladies' Detective Agency," which
takes great pleasure in shifting
expectations about shows set in

contemporary Africa.
Based on the series of nov-
els by British author Alexander
McCall Smith, the show follows
Botswana's only female detec-
tive, Precious Ramotswe (singer
Jill Scott). The show essentially
transplants a basic procedural
format - Precious, like the pro-
tagonists of FOX's "House" and
USA Network's "Psych," is an
expert at solving mysteries - to
an African backdrop. The show's
execution, however, keeps every-
thing fresh.
Scott, who is better known as
a singer than an actress, is excel-
lent as Precious, bringing the
right amounts of humor and grav-
ity to the role. Whether goad-
ing a corrupt insurance agent or
being faced down by a gangster,
it's easy to think of Precious as a
detective whose ambition some-
times exceeds her skills. At the
same time, Scott's relationship
with her secretary Grace Makutsi
(Anika Noni Rose, "Dreamgirls"),

who serves as her proficient - if
socially inept - partner, keeps
the tone especially light, thanks
to the strength of both perfor-
mances.
It's especially rare to find a pro-
gram that manages to establish
its identity so quickly. The show's
Botswanan backdrop is as much of
a character as its cast, and the lei-
surely pace lets all of Botswana's
facets be thoroughly explored.
From the shots of the African
savanna to the booming capital
city of Gaborone (all backed by a
pan-African influenced sound-
track), the show affectionately
wears its cultural and geographic
influences on its sleeve.
Thankfully, "Detective Agency"
doesn't blatantly play off view-
ers' emotions the way some mov-
ies about Africa do. Outside of
some unsubtle visual bits in the
pilot about the political problems
of the region, the show sticks to
focusing on the human drama of
its characters. The show doesn't

gloss over the realities of the coun-
try, though, as plotlines delve into
such subjects as HIV/AIDS and
child abduction. "Detective Agen-
cy," however, doesn't try to pull off
melodrama where it can't, and it's
better because of it.
But the show's mishandling
of its procedural format derails
things slightly. The episodes thus
far have been anchored around the
agency solving cases of the week,
but the action never builds a sense
of weight toward an overarching
storyline. The case inevitably gets
solved, but without any indication
that it'll actually matter by the
next episode. The show ends up
feeling more lightweight than its
pedigree deserves.
Still, solid performances and
the show's undeniable charm
make it hard to nitpick its faults.
Even if "The No. 1 Ladies' Detec-
tive Agency" relies too heavily on a
basic formula, it gets enough right
for a satisfying, if familiar, end
product.

lies - those
few items that
are immune to the effects of time,
staying forever unchanged. Like
Twinkies.
The Indigo Girls are a bit like
Twinkies. They've been around
forever, never unanimouslypopu-
lar but they always have a cult of
fervent followers. The content of
their songs is complicated and
obscured by heavy metaphor, and
the topics of their songs are often
at the center of some kind of con-
troversy. The duo's newest album,
the two-disc Poseidon and the
Bitter Bug, follows this pattern.
It's folksy and sweet, but it's still
full of hidden morals. Poseidon
is about as good as the duo's last
few albums, but not asgreat as the
music the Indigo Girls put out in
their prime.
The first disc features 10
tracks, with Amy Ray and Emily
Sailers backed by a band and sup-
ported by all the usual trappings
a well-polished production stu-
dio can offer. Even so, the Indigo
Girls are known for their live acts
and folksy sounds, and perhaps
it's because of this that Ray and
Sailers include a second disc to
the release; it contains stripped-
down acoustic versions of the
same material found on the first
disc. The acoustic versions of the
songs, itseems, maintains a sound
more consistent with their previ-
ous, less-produced material.
Because Ray and Saliers are
not ones to fix what seems to be
working,theystickto theirsigna-
ture sound: folk music heavy on
acoustic guitar and vocals while
light on keyboard, percussion
and other frills. The Girls' voices
are notable as well; Sailers's soft
falsetto complements the hippie
vibe of the music and Ray's deep-
er voice adds a rough edge to the
tunes. Yet unlike the pure and
simple melodies of their big hits
in the early'90s (like "Galileo" or
"Romeo and Juliet"), this album
feels a bit contrived. An over-
produced and formulaic sound
turns even the best of their lyrics'
Americana imagery to sap.
While the album's sound holds
the disc down, the lyrics carve
out moving stories with artistic

perfection. Three main themes
(Americana, nostalgia and tradi-
tional myths and fables) are used
on the album. They are fashioned
by metaphor and imagery intelli-
gent enough to seize beauty over
melodrama - most of the time.
"Fleet of Hope" champions
the beauty of the human capacity
for hope. Allegorical in nature,
the song begins with the story of
a girl and a fisherman speaking
to one another while they stare
toward an ocean's horizon: "We
will have caught on to some-
thing by the end of the day / but
mostly we think about the one
that got away."
The listener is then taken
through a series of previous
periods of despair but always
comforted by the chorus's quali-
fier: "'Cause the fleet of hope is
so pretty when she's shining in
the port / and the harbor clings
to the jetty / for protection and
Why the Indigo
Girls are like
Twinkies.
support / Out in the choppy
waters the sharks swim and
play /you're all washed up when
Poseidon has his day." Put in
words as poetic as these, listen-
ers can almost forgive the ste-
reotypical emo imagery.
By far the most dramatic and
emotionally charged track on
the album is "True Romantic." It
opens with bare vocals and sparse
guitar chords, building slowly
before exploding into rocking
belts, soaring piano and pounding
kick drums and cymbal crashes.
The track's painful admission of
personal faults gives listeners a
glimpse of the Girls' inner modern
rock goddess. And that goddess
looks a lot like Alanis Morissette.
The duo might have done
better by picking and choosing
between the full and acoustic ver-
sions of the album, as some songs
work well backed by the band but
falter in their acoustic counter-
parts, and vice-versa. The album
continues the Indigo Girls' trend
of turning out mildly disappoint-
ing efforts - something fans
have come to expect as the past
seven or so albums have fallen
flat compared to 1992's heralded
Rites ofPassage. Poseidon and the
Bitter Bug is full of poetically bril-
liant but melodically mediocre -
and occasionally cloying - folk
music.

Students abroad
in Italy unaffected
by earthquake

Kim proves he's still in charge
Limping slightly,
North Korean leader

country's parliament "-

University officials
report no students
attending schools
near disaster zone
By MALLORY JONES
Daily StaffReporter
While the ground violently
shook and buildings collapsed
during a 6.3 magnitude earth-
quake in Italy on Monday, Michi-
gan students studying abroad kept
sleeping.
According to The New York
Times, the earthquake in L'Aquila
killed 150 people and has left
40,000-50,000 people homeless.
But Michigan students studying
abroad in Italy were not near the
epicenter and their experiences
remain unaffected, officials from
the University's Office of Interna-
tional Programs and students in
Italy report.
After the earthquake, the OIP
made sure that all Michigan stu-
dents in Italy were safe by con-
tacting program coordinators,
Nicole LeBlanc, assistant direc-
tor of the OIP, said.
"That's one of the first things
we do," LeBlanc said. "We always
monitor global events and make
sure everybody's alright."

Claire Harold is living and study-
ing in Milan, which is about 380
miles from the disaster zone. She

campaign that calls for assistance
from the Ann Arbor community.
The Performance Network
hopes to raise $20,000 from both
old and new community support-
ers. For every dollar raised, the
Performance Network will match
the contribution with money
from a $20,000 grant raised by
leading community supporters
and the Performance Network's
board of directors, she said.
To get the word out, Milarch
said the Performance Network is
taking advantage of every avail-
ableresource itcan. Milarch added
that the campaign calls on old and
new sponsors alike to make any
contribution that they can.
"We've had everything from a
dollar to $750 gifts," she said.
According to Milarch, as of 1
p.m.on Thursday,the Performance
Network had raised $4,900.

said she was unaware of the earth-
quake until the U.S. Embassy sent
an e-mail notifying U.S. citizens
abroad.
Harold said although she did
not need any type of aid, she was
surprised at the lack of direct
communication between the stu-
dents and the University.
"The University has not con-
tacted me or anyone else I have
talked to for that matter," she said
in an e-mail interview. "I was told
they would in a time like this."
LeBlanc said the University
does not have any students study-
ing in L'Aquila.
LSA junior Alexandra White
is studying in Rome, which is
about 90 miles east of L'Aquila.
She said she slept through the
tremors and heard about the
earthquake from friends and
family checking to make sure
she was OK, and from The New
York Times.
"I don't know anyone who was
directly affected by it, and while
the reports of the destruction and
devastation are sad, I have not
been directly affected," she said
in an e-mail interview.
White said while Rome was
unaffected, students there are
pitching in to help the victims.
"(A) school here in Rome, John
Cabot University, has put out col-
lection and donation boxes around
campus for students to donate
clothes, home goods and canned
food for the earthquake victims,"
she said.
"We are just trying to keep the
momentum going," she said.
Milarch said the company's
board of directors will meet at
the end of the campaign next
week to discuss the Performance
Network's future. If the goal of
$40,000 has not been met, she said
the board might consider closing
the Performance Network.
If all goes well with the cam-
paign, the Performance Network
will continue to fundraise after
the Wednesday deadline, Milarch
said. Performance Network
officials hope to raise $150,000
through grants from foundations,
fundraiser events and private
underwritings by Oct. 1.
She said the Performance Net-
work is hoping to collect as much
as $75,000 of the $150,000 from
new sources.
Milarch said anyone who is
interested in making a donation
can directly call the Performance
Network or visit its website www.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - A
visibly grayer and thinner Kim Jong
I1 proved yesterday he remains in
charge of communist North Korea,
presiding over parliament in a tri-
umphant return to center stage
after months out of the public eye
following a reported stroke.
Limping slightly, Kim arrived
at the grand hall housing the 687-
seat Supreme People's Assembly to
a standing ovation and praise for a
weekend rocket launch heralded as
"historic" at home though assailed
in some nations as provocative.
A master at building drama, Kim
fed the world's curiosity for months
about his health after reports said
he had a stroke and underwent
brain surgery in August - though
North Korea has denied that he
was ever ill.
Kim solemnly acknowledged
his reappointment as chairman
of the powerful National Defense
Commission, which under North
Korea's constitution makes him the
nation's top leader while his father,
late North Korea founder Kim Il
Sung, remains "eternal president."
"Having comrade Kim Jong Il at
the highestpostcofour country again
is a great honor and happiness for
our military and people and a great
happy event for all Korean people,"
a newscaster said on state TV.
State media made no mention

In this image made off KRT footage distributed by APTN, North Korean leader Kim Jong 11 reads a document during the first
session of Supreme People's Assembly of the country yesterday in Pyongyang, North Korea.

of Kim from August until October,
when there indications that he had
re-emerged, with accounts of his
visits to farms, factories and mili-
tary bases. But no video images of
him were released until this week.
And Thursday's appearance was
his first at a major public event, with
taped video footage broadcast the
same day, finally putting to rest any
question about whether he has recu-
perated from the reported stroke
that sparked fears of a succession
crisis in the nuclear-armed nation.
Kim looked healthy, if older,
on Thursday, but the weight loss
appeared to have been sudden,

leaving the skin on his once-pudgy
face hanging loosely.
Despite the limp, it was clear
"Kim JongIl has no problem ruling
the country," said Yang Moo-jin, a
professor at Seoul's University of
North Korean Studies.
Outside observers were watch-
ing closely for signs he may be lay-
ing the groundwork for a successor
following the health scare.
Kim has ruled the impoverished
nation of 24 million with absolute
authority since his father's death
in 1994, allowing no dissent or
opposition. Both Kims thrived on
an intense cult of personality, with

their portraits hanging in nearly
every room.
However,noneof Kim'sthreesons
was elected to parliament in March,
and they are not believed ready to
assume the leadership mantle.
In a significant appointment
Thursday, Kim's brother-in-law,
Jang Song Thaek, a senior Workers'
Party member, was named to the
powerful defense commission.
Kim appears to be boosting
Jang's authority, perhaps to pave
the way for him to assume more
power, said Cheong Seong-chang,
a North Korea expert at South
Korea's Sejong Institute.

Military family lets press cover its dead son

Pentagon recently
lifted 18-year ban on
covering a fallen
soldier's return home
DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del.
(AP) - The body of a Marine killed
in Afghanistan arrived at Dover Air
Force Base on yesterday, marking
the third time this week that the
media were allowed to witness the
return of a fallen U.S. serviceman
from overseas.
A Northwest Airlines 747 cargo
plane that left Ramstein, Germany,

bearing the body of Marine Lance
Cpl. Blaise A. Oleski of Holland Pat-
ent, N.Y., arrived at 4:50 p.m. at the
Delaware base, home to the nation's
largest military mortuary. Oleski,
22, was killed Wednesday in Hel-
mand province, the Pentagon said.
As the sun sank lower in a cloud-
dappled blue sky, casting shadows
on the tarmac, a white-gloved
Marine Corps carry team boarded
the plane. Steppingin cadence, they
flanked the flag-draped transfer
case bearing their comrade's body.
Songbirds chirped in the dis-
tance as mortuary chaplain Maj.
Klavens Noel said a prayer over the
fallen Marine.

Members of Oleski's family then
watched solemnly as the team gen-
tly moved the transfer case to the
end of a cargo loader, which was
slowly lowered to the ground.
Dover base commander Col. Man-
son Morris, accompanied by Marine
Lt. Col. Carl Henger and acting Navy
Secretary B.J. Penn, stood rigidly as
Oleski's body was transferred into a
waiting mortuary vehicle.
Oleski's family gave permis-
sion for the media coverage and
watched as the transport vehicle
drove off into the distance.
Oleski was assigned to 3rd Bat-
talion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd
Marine Division, II Marine Expe-

ditionary Force, based at Camp
Lejeune, N.C.
The Pentagon's 18-year ban on
media covering the return of fallen
U.S. service members to the Dover
mortuary ended Sunday with the
return of an Air Force staff ser-
geant killed in Afghanistan. An
Army specialist killed in Iraq was
returned Tuesday and the press
was allowed to watch.
The new Pentagon policy gives
families of deceased troops the
right to decide on media coverage.
Of the four families who have been
given the option under the new pol-
icy, three have consented to cover-
age, military officials said.

referral from the adviser to someone
else who could answer his questions.
Despite the fact that there is one
adviser for every 554 LSA students,
Dodd said that Markman's case is
unusual and that most students are
able to see an adviser within a few
days of their inquiries.
He added that the Advising Center
strives to meet the needs of students
by working with the LSA Academic
AdvisingConsultingGroup-agroup
made up of 35 students that provides
feedback on new advising programs
- and the Student Affairs Panel on
Academic Advising, the LSA Student
Government subcommittee charged
with overseeing advising.
"As a result, we are very

Charnik said the goal of their
music industry-centered busi-
ness is to create a more accessible
online community of fans, lesser-
known artists and venues with a
website.
"[Relive]is a concept that records
live performances, markets them
and then distributes them for the
benefit of small concert venues and
emerging musicians," he said. "In
the long term, we want to develop
an online community that really
connects people with live perfor-

instant access to their fans and vice
versa."

have made many helpful changes
in what we do and how we do it
as a result of student participa-
tion in our planning and decision
making," he said.
LSA freshman Jordan Bailey, a
political science major, said he was
able to schedule an appointment to
see his adviser within a reasonable
amount of time, but it only added
to his confusion when he received
conflicting advice from his concen-
tration adviser.
"When I went to my political sci-
ence adviser, he definitely told me
about a different path than my LSA
adviser," he said.
Students looking to enter the
medical field are faced with the
challenge of fulfilling numer-
classes in the Business School.
"We, as ateam, sculpted our ideas
into a viable business for our class,
New Venture Creation ES615," he
said. "My personal interests are in
the music industry in general, so I
was happy to help create something
that would bring new value for
emerging artists."
Richman said after they came up
with the initial plan for the busi-
ness, they spent considerable time
consulting with experts in vari-
ous fields. Though they plan to run
the business themselves, they have
taken full advantage of the resourc-
es the University has to offer, Rich-
man said.
"We've spent a lot of time talk-
ing to all sorts of people: profes-
sors, people in the music industry,
those who operate venues and pro-
duce music," he said. "We also have
a music industry adviser with 30

ous medical school admissions
requirements in addition to regu-
lar LSA requirements, often with-
out what they describe as sufficient
help from advisers specific to the
health field.
LSA freshman Keely Browning,
who hopes to go to medical school,
said she was frustrated by the lack
of pre-health advisers.
"Pre-med requirements are hard
to fill," she said. "More specific
advising would be really helpful."
Dodd said he recognizes that
there is a shortage in appointments
for pre-health students and said he
hopes the problem will be recti-
fied next semester by a pre-health
resource room where peer advisers
will answer questions for students.
years experience - we're hoping
that it all pays off."
Richman said it could take a
while for the business to get off
the ground, but that making the
competition is an important first
step.
"The one thing we're doing right
now is going to these types of com-
petitions to network a little with
different investors and to hopefully
win some money to start moving
ahead in our planning," Richman
said excitedly. "We're hoping to use
(the prize money) to launch a beta
version of our website, find finan-
cial partners and start to bring on
additional staff."
Following the competition,
Charnik and Richman said they
hope to work with students at the
University interested in computer
science or programming to get
going with their business plan.

work on a project that will help
the group connect with the state of
Michigan.
"The chance for us to do a road
trip across the state is really mean-
ingful," Manzon said. "Especially
to the University of Michigan, since
we are racing across Michigan and
raising money locally that stays in
Michigan, which is something real-
ly positive."

Brewer said donating the pro-
ceeds to GOTR made sense not only
because it is a local charity, but also
because of its "shared passion for
running with important life les-
sons."
The members of MRun plan to
get the girls in GOTR involved in
the race by having them run with
the group for one mile down Huron
Street. Brewer said that by running
with the girls, MRun members hope
to share with them what they've
learned from the sport.
"Each one of us has discovered

how much running can enrich a
person's life," she said. "I hope that
this can be shared with as many
girls as possible through our sup-
port of the Girls On The Run pro-
gram."
Manzon said the group is hoping
to expand the race in the future.
"I think this is going to be a con-
tinual event that happens every
year," he said. "We'd like to make
a race against other schools and
continue to get Girls On The Run
involved across the state not just
locally."

Senior claims 101st
victory as a member
of the Wolverines to
break team record
By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Writer
It was game, set, 101st match
win for Chisako Sugiyama yes-
terday - the senior set a school
record for most wins in a career.
The accomplishment over-
shadowed another successful day
for the Michigan women's ten-
nis team, which beat Texas A&M
6-1 at the
Varsity TEXAS A&M 1
Tennis MICHIGAN 6
Center.
"This feels really good," Sugi-
yama said through the Athletic
Department. "I didn't even know
what the top mark was when I first
arrived here, and I had no idea
that I would even have a chance
to match it or surpass it."
During the match, it seemed
like every spectator's eyes were
focused on Sugiyama, who sur-
passed former Wolverine Sarah
Cyganiak on the all-time singles
wins list. Sugiyama tied Cyga-
niak's mark Sunday against Penn
State.
"(Cyganiak) was an amazing
player who did so many great
things for Michigan," Sugiyama
said. "I'm just thrilled to even be
compared to her. I have to thank
all three coaches, the assistant
coaches, the trainers and of
course my team. I couldn't have
done it without all of their sup-
port."
Sugiyama's record-setting
match was not without drama.
After she jumped out to a quick
4-1 lead, her opponent, Morgan
Frank, won consecutive games to
seize the momentum and cut the
deficit to one game.
In the ensuing game, Sugiyama
charged the net and won on a slic-
ing drop shot. Frank dropped her
racket and looked to the sky, the
match - and Sugiyama's place in
Michigan tennis history - all but
sealed.
Sugiyama went on to win 6-4,
6-3.
"I knew (Frank) was going to
be a good player, she made me
work hard," Sugiyama said. "She
was the kind of player, I think, a
year ago, I would have lost to."
Frank was very vocal through-
out the match, at one point yell-

time we lose three games (against
MAC opponents) like we have,
(we) definitely shouldn't be over-
looking them."
Michigan's only loss to a MAC
squad last season was also to Cen-
tral Michigan. The Wolverines
blew a 3-0 lead and allowed seven
unanswered runs in the process.
The Chippewas outdid last
year's performance, notching 10
unanswered runs in seven innings
before Michigan managed a run in
the bottom of the seventh.
After the loss to Eastern Michi-
gan on Mar.17,junior firstbaseman
Mike Dufek said the Wolverines
"knew (they) were supposed to
win" and overlooked the Eagles.
The next week, Cislo said the Wol-
verines "weren't prepared" when
they were downed by Bowling
Green 8-3. On Wednesday, it was
the same story.
"We weren't playing with fire in
our bellies," senior catcher and tri-
captain Tim Kalczynski said. "Any
team we play is a threat, and we
just haven't been playing crisp like
that."
Michigan will play in five more
games against MAC teams this
season.

often than Maloney may have origi-
nally hoped.

Wednesday for the first time after
injuring his shoulder against Oak-
land on Mar. 31st. Junior catcher
Chris Berset, who started in 37
games last season, played catch
before the game. He suffered a bro-
ken thumb on his throwing hand
against Jacksonville in February.
Maloney said both players should
be ready for action next weekend
against intrastate rival Michigan
State.
NOTES: Michigan will take on
Illinois in a three-game series in
Ann Arbor this weekend, starting
tonight at 7 p.m. The series is an
important one for the Wolverines,
as they sit just one game behind the
Fighting Illini for first place in the
Big Ten.... Rick Samuel, a left-hand-
ed pitcher from White Lakewilljoin
the 2009 recruiting class, according
to an Athletic Department state-
ment. The preferred walk-on is the
seventh player to join the class.
"I'm very excited about this
group, especially since all of them
are from Michigan," Maloney said
in the statement.

Senior Chisako Sugiyama broke the Michigan record for career wins with her 6-4, 6-3 victory yesterday.

ing, "My grandmother could play
better than me!"
Probably not - but Sugiyama
tends to make players feel that
way.
Though most of the afternoon
was focused on Sugiyama, Michi-
gan coach Ronni Bernstein said the
senior leader is all about the team.
"She wants to do well for her-

self, obviously, but wants to do
well for the team, too," Bernstein
said. "When you have that com-
bination and you're a good com-
petitor, good things are going to
happen."
And good things definitely hap-
pened for the Wolverines yester-
day. They won the initial doubles
point before Sugiyama took the

court for her match.
The other five Wolverine vic-
tories were decided in two games
apiece. By the time the Aggies
got on the scoreboard with their
lone point, the overall match was
already decided. Michigan closed
it out on a positive note in the No.
3 singles spot with sophomore
Denise Muresan's 6-3, 6-3 win.

For the 40,000 fans Michigan
football coach Rich Rodriguez
hopes come out for tomorrow's
spring game, the event will be a
chance to get a first glimpse at the
2009 edition of the Wolverines.
And they'll also get to see a few
faces they might remember from
seasons past.
To prepare for his first open-
to-the-public spring game, Rodri-
guez has worked with the Athletic
Department
to make the
festivities Annual
more fan springgame
friendly. Part
of that is the When:

scrimmage.
When Ron Bellamy, a Michigan
wide receiver from 1999-2002,
was asked by assistant athletic
director for football Scott Draper
to play in the game, he jumped at
the chance.
"Scott knows I'm a Michigan
man until the day I die," Bellamy
said. "And he knows that once he
asked me, I wasn't going to turn
down the opportunity to be back
in that stadium and be a part of
something special."
Other big-name players on the
roster include Rick Leach (quar-
terback from 1975-78), Anthony
Thomas (running back from 1997-
2000), Aaron Shea (tight end from
1996-99) and Scott Dreisbach
(quarterback from 1995-98).
At practice Tuesday, Bellamy
comfortably roamed the sidelines,
chatting with coaches and others
in attendance. Although the staff

the facilities, the place where we
warm up before the game," he
said. "Every fan is interested in
that, and I think that's important
to keep the interest in the game.
"Michigan football is going to
sell itself, but I think it's special
that you're allowing the fans to be
a big part of it."
Members on the team, how-
ever, aren't so focused on the off-
the-field hoopla.
"I'm excited to just be out there
playing football," junior lineback-
er Obi Ezeh said. "I don't really
get caught up with it. It will be
nice to be back in the Big House,
that's for sure, but other than that,
I'm just excited to go out and
play."
Unfortunately for Ezeh,
Rodriguez said the game will be
"watered down." He said that
Michigan may have some news
packages this year, and Rodriguez
doesn't want to give too much
away to Western Michigan and
Notre Dame - the first two team
the Wolverines will face this sea-
son.
Althoughitwon'tbeafullgame,
there will be certain situations,
like two-minute and goal-line
drills, which will pit the first-
team offense versus first-team
defense. And fans will get to see
their first glimpse of quarterback
Tate Forcier. The highly touted
early-enrolee will take most of the
reps with the first-team offense
because redshirt junior Nick
Sheridan sustained a leg fracture
earlier this spring.
"We don't have enough guys, I
think, to have atruegame, amaize
and blue team," Rodriguez said.
"But (fans will) be able to see guys
compete a little bit, watch some of
our young guys out there for the
first time and have a little fun. It
will be mostly live, so hopefully
there will be a few plays they'll be
enjoying."

is completely different than when
the wide receiver was with the
program, Bellamy has a long his-
tory with Rodriguez.
While at Archbishop Shaw
High School in New Orleans,
Bellamy was recruited by Rodri-
guez, the offensive coordinator at
Tulane at the time.
"I've known Coach Rodriguez
for a while," Bellamy said. " I used
to go to games and stuff when he
was at Tulane. He ran the same
offense. So I've seen his offense
for quite some time, but it's new
to a lot of Michigan folks."
Bellamy, who played in his fair

share of Michigan spring games,
is excited to see the changes that
Rodriguez and Co. are bringing to
the event.
Other activitiesplannedinclude
locker room tours, an introduc-
tion of ex-Wolverines who played
in this year's Super Bowl and a
field goal challenge for Univer-
sity students. Prior to this year,
the day usually involved just a
scrimmage and an autograph ses-
sion.
"I like the marketing idea,

the game, let them see what the
players go through, let them see
