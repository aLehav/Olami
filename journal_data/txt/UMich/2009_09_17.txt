New evidence should
exonerate Vinson,
attorneys say
By JILLIAN BERMAN
and JACOB SMILOVITZ
Daily News Editors
At a press conference yesterday,
officials from the University's In-
nocence Clinic announced that the

clinic filed a motion Monday to free
Karl Vinson, a man they say is in
prison because of false evidence.
In the motion, the organization,
which seeks to exonerate wrong-
fully convicted prisoners, argues
that Vinson could not have com-
mitted the crime for which he has
spent the last 23 years of his life in
prison.
After clinic officials secured the
scientific evidence they believe ex-
onerates Vinson, they informed the

Wayne County Prosecutor's office
in June 2009, in hopes that the of-
fice would join them in asking for a
relief of judgment.
After meeting with senior
members of the prosecutor's staff
multiple times and testing a slide
from the victim's rape kit - at the
Innocence Clinic's expense - the
prosecution is still dragging its feet,
according to Law School Associate
Dean Bridget McCormack, co-di-
rector of the Innocence Clinic.

"We filed our motion on Monday
because we couldn't move forward
in good conscience," she said.
In 1986, Vinson was accused of
sexual criminal conduct and break-
ing and entering with intent to com-
unit a felony. In May of that yoar, ht
was sentenced to concurrent sen-
tences of 10 to 50 years and 5 to 15
years for, as prosecutors claimed,
raping a nine-year-old girl.

Breaking tradition,
the Big House now
pumps in music
By MALLORY BEBERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Michigan fans young and old
take pride in the marching band.
This year, though, officials threw
tradition to the wind and decided to
give the band a break. That's right,
Michigan has finally jumped on the
"canned" music bandwagon.
For the first time ever, the Big
House is playing popular music
over the public address system dur-
ing some breaks in game play.
Mark Riordan, the assistant ath-
letic director for marketing, said
the Athletic Department spent a lot
of time during the off-season dis-
cussing new ways it could enrich
the game day experience.
"All of our peers play music," he
said. "We were pretty much the last
school in our stature to do this."
In a press conference on Monday,
head football coach Rich Rodriguez
said anything that creates a more
interactive and lively experience in
the stadium is fine by him.
"The best experience is if we're
playing well and winning," he said.
"But you notice how long these TV
timeouts are? Oh, it's brutal. So with
all that dead time that you have with
the TV timeouts, if there's a way
that you can use the band, and the
student section, and the crowd and
music and get everybody into the
game so they enjoy the experience
and come back whether you win or
lose, that's a positive thing."
The Athletic Department hopes
to play music that Michigan fans

can relate to.
Riordan said the Athletic Depart-
ment want to play songs applicable
to the Michigan experience and
also avoid songs already claimed by
other schools.
"Lose Yourself" by Eminem and
"Seven Nation Army" by the White
Stripes have been played because
of the both artists' connection to
Detroit.
So far, Riordan said, feedback
has been mixed, though it has been
"more favorable than unfavorable
both weeks."
"I think it's a really good thing ex-
cept when they play songs played in
other team's stadiums" said LSA se-
nior Noah Weber. "I think 'Lose Your-
self' is an awesome choice but they
need to use (canned music) wisely"
Weber said the techno hit "Zom-
bie Nation" by Kernkraft 400,
which was used in both games this
year at the Big House, had long
been a favorite in Beaver Stadium
at Penn State University, and thus
should be avoided.
Business senior Jason Javer likes
the addition too.
"I think the music is really posi-
tive and adds a good atmosphere," he
said. "Because it's such a big stadium,
it really brings everyone together."
Junior safety Troy Woolfolk said in
Monday's press conference that he
didn't particularly like the music.
"I don't like none of the music,
but I have a tendency to dance some
of time, so regardless of what it is,
I'm going to dance to it," he said.
When asked what songs he would
prefer to hear instead of the music
currently played at the Big House,
Woolfolk had a few suggestions.
"See, I'm from Texas, and y'all
might not really know the type of

The embezzlement scandal of 1973

Being the president for
sny organization csn be
a dsunting task, snd for
the University's 1973 Stu-
dent Government Council
president, this task was
made even mnre daunting
when he was charged with
embezzlement.
Lee Gill's rival can-
didates pointed fingers
when $8,500 from the SGC
account was transferred
to another account in
Detroit under Gill's name.
The word embezzlement
was thrown around, but
solid evidence could not
be found, according to an
Oct. 16, 1973 article in The
Michigan Daily.
The $8,500 was with-
drawn by Gill from the

Huron Valley Bank in the
formo of a cashier's check,
and the transfer was made
tn provide easier access to
the money, he claimed. It
also kept the money away
from University officials.
Once in the Detroit bank,
however, the money story
becomes a little murky.
Gill claimed that he put
the money under his name
because several bank tell-
ers told him that he lacked
the proper identification to
open a corporate account.
He then set up two
accounts, one under his
name, and another under
K. Haywood, a friend who
went to the bank with
Gill, because Gill had only
brought a student ID.

Gill asserted that he had
every intention of return-
ing the next day to properly
open the account.
HoweverMonte Labadie,
the offical of Manufac-
turer's National where Gill
opened the account, gave
a different report. Labadie
said that Gill made no men-
tion of corporate accounts.
His suspicions were only
heightened when Gill did
not have appropriate iden-
tification, and the cashier's
check was made out to the
bank instead of the orga-
nization from which the
money came.
The bank's Loss Preven-
tion Department called
Huron Valley Bank after
receiving a call from

Labadie. According to John
Kennedy, the head of the
department, Gill had the
money taken out of the SGC
account and made into a
cashier's check per his per-
sonal request.
Henry Johnaon, vice
president of Student Ser-
vices, looked into the mat-
ter, and had no reason to
suspect that there was any
criminal activity going on.
In the end, Gill, David
Fowler, the SGC adminis-
trative vice president, and
SGC Treasurer Rosemary
Mullin went into the bank
the next day and removed
the money, which waa
promptly returned to Ann
Arbor.

Baucus unveils
health care
reform plan

GOP criticizes
long-awaited plan
from Senate Finance
Commitee chair
WASHINGTON (AP) - His calls
for compromise rebuffedby Repub-
licans, the Democratic chairman
of the Senate Finance Committee
unveiled sweeping legislation yes-
terday to remake the nation's costly
health care system largely along the
lines outlined by President Barack
Obama.
Sen. Max Baucus' proposal,
months in the making, drew quick
criticism from liberals who said his
vision was too cramped and from
Republicans who deemed it overly
expansive. Yet whatever its fate,
its mere release marked a critical
turning point in Congress' long and
tumultuous debate over Obama's
top domestic priority.
The Finance Committee is to
meet next week to vote on the
plan, and after combining it with

another panel's bill, Major-
ity Leader Harry Reid intends to
begin debate on the Senate floor
late this month or early Octo-
ber. Across the Capitol, Speaker
Nancy Pelosi has been waiting to
see Baucus' health care prescrip-
tion before advancing compan-
ion legislation toward a vote by
the House.
"We cannot let this opportu-
nity pass," Baucus, D-Mont., said
as he outlined a $856 billion plan'
designed to protect millions who
have unreliable insurance or no
coverage at all, at the same time
restraining the explosive growth of
medical costs.
Congressional budget experts
estimated the proposal would
reduce the ranks of the uninsured
by 29 million over a decade. They
also predicted the plan would trim
federal deficits by $49 billion over
the same period and suggested sav-
ings in the range of hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars might result for the
decade that follows.
Many of the bill's major provi-
sions would be delayed until 2013,

Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.) explains his health care proposal ata press conference in Washington, D.C. yesterday.

after the next presidential election.
But the impact of one of the
key concessions Baucus made in
a so-far-unsuccessful search for
Republican support - allowing
cooperatives, rather than the fed-
eral government, to sell insurance
in competition with private indus-
try - was judged harshly.
"They seem unlikely to establish
a significant market presence in
many areas of the country," wrote
Douglas W. Elmendorf, head of the
Congressional Budget Office.
Supporters claim the co-ops
would compete effectively with pri-

vate companies and help hold down
the cost of insurance, but CBO's
assessment is likely to re-energize
advocates of direct government
competition.
White House press secretary
Robert Gibbs called the overall
legislation an "important building
block" that "gets us closer to com-
prehensive health care reform."
Reid, too, described it as
"another important piece to the
puzzle" on the road to health care
legislation.
Pelosi said that while the bill
would do less than House legisla-

tion to make coverage more afford-
able, its emergence "will move this
historic debate forward."
Senate Republican leader Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, who has
labored to keep his rank and file
united in opposition, called ita par-
tisan proposal that "cuts Medicare
by nearly a half-trillion dollars and
puts massive new tax burdens on
families and small businesses, to
create yet another thousand-page,
trillion-dollar government pro-
gram. Only in Washington would
anyone think that makes sense,
especially in this economy."

FBI searches Colorado house in terror probe

Denver man with
suspected links to
al-Qaida questioned
over possible New
York City bomb plot
AURORA, Colo. (AP) - Federal
agents yesterday searched the home
of a suburban Denver man identi-
fied by law enforcement as having
a possible link to al-Qaida, carting
away several boxes of evidence.
The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task
Force went through the home of
NajibullahZazi, as well as the near-
by residence of his aunt, Rabia Zazi,

FBI special agent Kathleen Wright
said Wednesday.
Zazi denies that he's a central
figure in a terrorism investigation
that -fed fears of a possible bomb
plot and led to several police raids
in New York City on Monday.
Zazi, 24, was being interviewed
at FBI headquarters in Denver
late Wednesday but was not under
arrest, according to his attorney,
Arthur Folsom. Zazi provided
authorities a DNA sample, a fin-
gerprint, handwriting samples and
information about his travel his-
tory, Folsom said.
"My client is not involved in any
terror plot," Folsom declared. "He
answered every question they had."
The U.S. Attorney's Office in

Denver said it had no immediate
comment.
One agent wearing protective
clothing escorted a dog belonging
to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives into Zazi's
apartment. FBI agents left Zazi's
apartment with at least six boxes.
One box was labeled "swabs," and
others were marked "fragile" and
"glass."
Agents also escorted three
women and a man from the apart-
ment. Two of the women covered
their faces with headscarves, and
the third used a canvas chair to
shield her face. All were driven
away in an SUV.
The searches came a day after
two law enforcement officials told

The Associated Press that a joint
FBI-New York Police Department
task force had put Zazi under sur-
veillance because ofsuspectedlinks
to al-Qaida.
The task force also feared Zazi
may be involved in a potential plot
involving homemade hydrogen per-
oxide-based explosives like those
cited in an intelligence warning
issued Monday, said the officials,
who spoke on anonymity because
they were not authorized to speak
about the investigation.
After Zazi traveled to New York
City over the weekend, FBI agents
and police officers armed with
search warrants seeking bomb
materials searched three apart-
ments and questioned residents in

a predominantly Asian neighbor-
hood in Queens.
Naiz Khan, an Afghan immi-
grant who grew up with Zazi in
New York City, said the FBI ques-
tioned him for about two hours
about Zazi, whom he said stayed at
his apartment last week.
No arrests were announced, and
the FBI and NYPD have refused to
discuss the case.
New York Police Commissioner
Raymond Kelly and FBI Direc-
tor Robert Mueller said Wednes-
day there are no specific terrorist
threats to the city.
"There are no guarantees. We
live in a dangerous world," said
Kelly, who called New York the
world's best-protected city.

Txt u 8er
State should make texting and driving a secondary offense
Few would disagree that drunk driving is extremely dan-
gerous for both the drunk driver and any surrounding
cars on the road. But while driving under the influence is
a punishable offense, another activity that can be just as danger-
ous has long been regarded as totally acceptable. That activity
is texting. A bill to ban texting while on the road is currently
making its way through Michigan's House of Representatives.
This bill could be worthwhile, but if the state legislature really
wants to curb texting it will be wary of passing a law that broadly
empowers law enforcement and instead concentrate on a media
campaign instructing drivers not to text.

Over-glamorizing gays

I

When it hit theaters this sum-
mer, "Bruno" got the gay
community talking - and
not just about all
of its overt male
nudity. Though
the film was argu-
ably pro-gay,
given its satirical'
take on American
homophobia, many
in the LGBT com-
munity wereM
horrified by its MATTHEW
over-the-top per- GREEN
sonification of gay
stereotypes. And
in truth, despite possibly good inten-
tions, Bruno did occasionally cross the
line. But I'm not convinced that Sacha
Baron Cohen's gay caricature, however
offensive, really had an impact on the
way in which the mainstream straight
population views gay men.
After all, gays are everywhere these
days. In addition to their greater vis-
ibility intoday's more open societygay
menarebecomingincreasinglypresent
in popular film and television. Scads of
sitcoms and feature films expose view-
ers to what being gay is all about. That
is, of course, if being gay means being
fashion-obsessed, effeminate, gos-
sipy and irrepressibly horny. Critics of
"Bruno" are kidding themselves if they
don't see these stereotypes in perhaps
less explicit terms all over film and
television.
Such objectification isn't really
new to show business. In another era,
an audience might have laughed at a
white actor in blackface acting how
white society expected a black man to
act. White people, who may never have
had any meaningful experience with
blacks, gleaned all their knowledge
of black life through these images.
But African Americans had a distinct

culture during times of oppression to
give them some sense of self, and gay
adolescents have no such heritage
granted to them at birth. This vacancy
leaves them devoid of a model for self-
expression apart from what they see
on television as howa gay man is sup-
posed to act.
I realize now that such hackneyed
expectations were probably the hard-
est part for me in accepting. that I was
gay. My uber-progressive parents,
though probably less than thrilled,
were totally accepting of my sexual-
ity when I toldthem. And everyone in
high school sort of figured that I was
gay, so coming out wasn't exactly a
challenge. My only real problem with
my sexuality was the inadequacy it
made me feel for being a bad dancer
and having merely average fashion
sense. I obsessed over feeling that I
was something other than what gay
guys are supposed to be, and in many
ways, I tried to change myself. It's
ironic, I suppose, that in an attempt to
embrace what I was, I sought only to
emulate others.
But since I've seen through the fal-
lacy that I have to look a certain way
or like certain music to be a respect-
able gay man, I've grown more frus-
trated by the way the entertainment
industry illustrates gays. It seems that
whenever there's a gay character in
a blockbuster movie, he's always the
empathetic best friend or chic shop-
ping buddy of a female protagonist in
some sort of romantic quandary.
In television, it's much of the same.
Even on HBO, which is generally
considered "gay-friendly," the same
skewed archetypes peep through
all over the place. Airing "Angels in
America" and "The Laramie Project"
in addition to adding gay subplots to
virtually every original series has rev-
olutionized the way that gay identity

is addressed in entertainment. But in
shows like "Entourage," "True Blood"
and (most notably) "Sex and the City,"
pigeonholing of the gay male as an
oversexed materialist abounds. It's ter-
rific that each series features gay roles,
but is it so much to ask that a sitcom
highlight a gay character who is not a
decorator, fashionista, or sexaholic?

Hollywood
needs fewer gay
stereotypes.
There are, to be sure, examples of
seemingly "normal" gay characters
here and there. ABC's "Brothers and
Sisters" comes to mind for featuring
complex gay roles while avoiding cli-
ches. During its run on HBO, "Six Feet
Under" organically explored the emo-
tions and intricacies of a committed
gay couple. And who could forget the
decidedly un-stereotypical "Broke-
back Mountain"?
But for the most part, Hollywood's
representation of gay men is pretty
two-dimensional. It's time for writ-
ers and producers to incorporate more
multifaceted gay personae into their
shows. "Bruno" was uncomfortable
for audiences because we are so inun-
dated by flamboyant gay depictions in
the media that viewers weren't consis-
tently able to understand the film's big
joke. Adding new gay themes would
add freshness to tired plotlines, and
would help straight and even gay peo-
ple view gay life more favorably.

to find common ground with someone
you wouldn't spit on if they were on

to abdicate his responsibility, he was
making a valid point: an integral part
of curbing violence involves teaching
healthy relationships.
Where to begin? Well, let's lay out
the key questions. Howviolent do some
relationships really get? Where do col-
lege students fall in this and whyPAnd
the crown jewel: in what ways can we
foster healthy relationships?
Wolverines, we have a problem. You
know we are living in some scary times

need to run the serial number on her

ing to an article in the Los Angeles
Times on Aug. 25. It's one thing if you
can explain away the heightened vio-
lence among young people by faulting
celebrity eccentricity or just another
hyper-macho man in the running to
be the next Ike Turner. But college
students, in significant numbers, are
just as guilty of being perpetrators of
violence in relationships. A 2008 study
in the Archives of Pediatric Medicine
reported that 17 percent of college stu-
dents had been violent toward lovers
or peers and 40 percent experienced
emotional, sexual or physical violence.
What gives? Researchers in the
study say the support systems of col-

lege students suffer when they make
the transition into college. Further,
young folk may be running amok
because they aren't under the thumb
of parental units anymore. And then
there's the reason young folks do any-
thing on campus: social validation.
That's right, the 25.6 percent rate of
campus violence found in the study
is linked to the perennial need to be
accepted by peers for the reputation
of, in short, being a jerk.
So, let's turn the tide and get to this
healthy relationships stuff. Adoles-
cent Health Working Group, an orga-
nization I worked with this summer,
compiled these major tenets of healthy
relationships: pleasure, autonomy,
consent, equality and respect.
Pleasure. This may sound basic,
but it's less commonly thought about
than it may seem. Time spent with.
your partner should be enjoyable and
make you feel like you are a better
person. I'm not just talking about the
monthly orgasm tally either. Your con-
versations, date nights and having sex
should feel good to you significantly
more than it rakes your nerves.
Autonomy. You and your part-
ner need space in your togetherness.
This involves anything ranging from
instilling separate activities to sepa-
rate friendship networks. But the
catch is, you shouldn't have to fight to
get a weekend alone. And your all-boys
vacation shouldn't feel like a threat
to your relationship. You both should
feel as comfortable together as you are
apart. Check your clinginess.
Consent. First off, your commit-
ment doesn't translate to an all-access
pass to booty. Like the airport, consent
means there are routine check-ins
when you first arrive and along the
way. Desires should be discussed and
both parties should be clear on what is
okay and what is not okay sexually. As
a gentle suggestion, conversation on
sex should include protection methods
and contingency plans in the event of
contraceptive failure.
Equality. Ah, my favorite. The key
aspect of this concept is that decisions

impacting the relationship are made
together. This can involve discussions
on how date night is spent to thinking
about household labor divisions in the
future. Equality also means that there
are some things that won't be 50/50.
But you discuss those things and com-
pensate each other elsewhere if neces-
sary.
The top five ways
to maintain a
strong union.

Respect. I'll cut to the things Are-
tha hasn't touched on. Your partner
should respect your culture, bound-
aries and opinions. By culture, this
could be race-related or geographical.
If you are a geek from Boston with a
cute accent, your partner should value
that and not make ita constant punch
line. Boundaries are crucial, too. You
should have an expectation that if
you tell your partner you are too busy
cramming, that they hold off texting
you mug shots of their nether region.
On the opinion front: your politics
should get in the way of the feelings of
the person in front of you. No matter
the subject, you should be able to dis-
agree agreeably.
As these healthy relationship tidbits
are fundamentally about communi-
cation overall, I'll leave you with the
words of India.Arie.While her lyrics in
"Talk to Her" refer to women, all gen-
ders need apply. "Whenyoutalktoher,
talk to her like you'd want somebody to
talk to your mama... Cause everything
you do or say, you got to live with it
everyday. She's somebody's baby. She's
somebody's sister. She's somebody's
mama."

SFantasy football
v t w stereotypes

ARIEL BOND/Daily
Rich Rodriguez said he did not see an infraction on a play during which it appears Jonas Mouton punched a Notre Dame player.
No disciplinary action for
Mouton's apparent punch

One Daily writer's
journey through this
year 's draft
H ailing from Chicago,
I have zero loyalty to
the Detroit Lions. But
when Detroit's Louis Delmas
returned a fumble 65 yards to the
end zone last Sunday, I threw a
hissy fit. Drew Brees was on the
verge of his sixth touchdown
pass, which in fantasy football
terms means
"cha-ching."
You see, there
are few things
better than the
start of the fan-
tasy football
season for me.
Well, except
for the spec- ALEX
tacle that is a PROSPERI
fantasy foot-
ball draft.
On the night before this semes-
ter commenced, a dozen of my
friends gathered for a live draft at
my house.
After 16 rounds, tons of pizza
and the trio of Donte Stallworth,
Michael Vick and Plaxico Burress
being drafted in the final round
("That would be one sick prison
team," one owner said), it became
clear that every live draft I've
ever done includes the same six
types of people.
THE UNKNOWN: Simply put,
he's unpredictable. His insults
are overshadowed by his awful
picks, like drafting the Pittsburgh
defense in round seven.
He chews a Nutri-Grain bar
to assure he stays focused, and if
members of the opposite sex were
present, we would kick him out of
the room.
But tonight, his ineptness pro-
vides the entertainment. Wheth-
er it's making fun of Joe Flacco's
unibrow or making way-too-soon
jokes about Steve McNair, he's

hilarious.
And just how good is he at
drafting?
When debating between
two backup quarterbacks, he
used the "eeny meeny miny mo"
tactic.
THE BUZZKILL: The draft is
blazing along. Insults are flying
left and right and potato chip dip
is all over the table - courtesy of
me. Then it's the buzzkill's turn to
pick. His draft strategy is similar
to the Minnesota Vikings circa
the 2003 NFL Draft, taking for-
ever on every pick.
Some people think there is skill
when drafting players. In reality,
a monkey could pick a winner.
By round eight, when he takes
quarterback Matt Cassel, he is
still taking too long, which earns
him death stares from the other 1t
owners.
THE ODD COUPLE: If there was
ever a reality show about two col-
lege kids who are close friends but
absolutely hate each other, these
two would be more popular than
Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie.
Better yet, if there was an award
for two fraternity brothers who
act most like sorority girls, they
would also win.
Here is one of their sarcastic
exchanges:
Owner 1: "He'll get alot of car-
ries," after he drafts running back
Steven Jackson.
Owner 2: "Thanks for that
inside analysis."
And this:
Owner 1: "John Carlson, he'll be
good."
Owner 2: "Good research."
Owner 1: "Mark Schlereth said
it, so it has to be true."
THE "GREATEST": The oldest
member of the group is making his
picks over the phone from Boulder,
Colo. Although he has told every-
one he's taking Adrian Peterson
No. 1 overall, he refuses to make it
without calling in. This forces the
draft to start seven minutes late
and throws the whole night into a

frenzy.
He thinks he's so football-savvy
that he took the troubled Brandon
Marshall in round five and Chris
Henry one pick later.
An enormous ego leads him to
proclaim that he's not worried
about spending his final two picks
on guys no one else has heard of.
He's the guy who will instant
Message you after each pick and
chastise it. He even proclaims that
the auto-draft is smarter than one
of our owners. Sadly, he's the guy
who will probably win the league.
THE MOM: He's making sure
there are plenty of chips and
drinks available. He even offers
to drive people home after. But his
biggest accomplishment in the
draft comes in round five. Since
it's a live draft, we have a draft
board where each person attach-
es a sticker corresponding to his
pick.
Each position is color coordi-
nated. So when he drafts tight end
Antonio Gates in the fifth round,
giving him four different posi-
tions, he announces, "I have one of
every color. Yes!"
His excitement rubs off
on another owner, who, after
drafting tight end Tony Gonza-
lez says, "Oh my god, it's a new
color!"
THE NOT-SO-SMART ONE:
He's in the Business School and
has Michael Turner, Marion Bar-
ber, Roddy White, Kurt Warner,
Joseph Addai and Greg Olsen
after round six - not a squad to
kill for, but not bad, either.
The problem: all his picks have
byes during either week four or
week six. You can pencil him in
for a big "L" those two weeks.
Sometimes, cheat sheets just
aren't enough.

Charlie Weis doesn't appear to
be a fan of Big Ten officials.
Or, as the Notre Dame head
coach might see it, Big Ten officials
aren't fans of Charlie Weis.
During his Sunday press con-
ference, Weis complained about
the officiating during Michigan's
upset win of the Irish on Saturday.
As a part of his comments, Weis
indirectly referenced a play dur-
ing which Michigan linebacker
Jonas Mouton hit Irish center Eric
Olson.
Video replays show that Mouton
delivered a quick punch to Olson's
chin as play came to a stop at the
8:48 mark of the second quarter.
When asked about the episode
yesterday, Michigan coach Rich
* Rodriguez seemed caught off
guard.
"What are you talking about? I
know they were talking about one
incident, and from what we saw
on film, we didn't see anybody
throw a punch or anything like
that," Rodriguez said. "The little I
saw on the clip, I saw the guys got
tangled up together and Jonas was
trying to free himself. There were
a whole lot of officials out there.
I'm sure if there was an infraction,
they would have called it."
Rodriguez said Mouton will not
receive disciplinary action from
the team.
It's no secret that Saturday's
emotion-filled rivalry game led to
some added intensity. Mouton's
hit didn't appear to be a serious
infraction. It just happened to be
caught on camera.
It's hard to say if the conference
will discipline Mouton. In theory,

the league has made a priority in
recent years of ensuring such inci-
dents are few and far in between.
Sportsmanship and player safe-
ty have been rallying points for
coaches, players, officials and fans
for years. And in 2008, the Big Ten
officials made, those categories
their "points of emphasis" for the
season.
Who knows how well the Big
Ten officials took those sugges-
tions to heart. Some oflast season's
biggest incidents, like Wisconsin's
Jay Valai's helmet-to-helmet hiton
Ohio State's Dan "Boom" Herron
in October, went untouched by the
league and the Badgers.
Although Mouton will not by
disciplined by the team, the coach
added that he and his staff take a
stalwart approach to unsports-
manlike conduct.
"Let me make it perfectly clear
- no personal fouls will go unpun-
ished," Rodriguez said. "No penal-
ties go unpunished. Personal fouls
in particular, there is no place for
that in the game of football, not
only in the game but every day in
practice. We take great pride in
that."
Bill Carollo, the new Big Ten
coordinator of football officials,
told ESPN.com in June that
unsportsmanlike conduct, espe-
cially helmet-to-helmet colli-
sions, will again be major points
of emphasis for Big Ten officials in
2009.
"If you're going into the end
zone pointing at the guy you just
beat on a pass play and taunting
him, or making abig hit and stand-
ing over him like you just knocked
him out, that will not be tolerated,"
Carollo said.
According to ESPN.com, Big

Ten officials now will receive
video training tapes to high-
light proper enforcement. Head
coaches will receive similar vid-
eos throughout the season, with
the first scheduled to arrive next
Wednesday.
In Michigan's loss to Notre
Dame last September, former
tight end Carson Butler punched
an Irish player in the head after
the game was out of reach. Butler
was ejected from the game but
did not receive a suspension from
the Big Ten or Rodriguez.
DuringRodriguez's short Mich-
igan tenure, Butler has been the
only player to have such an inci-
dent. Rodriguez would not defend
Butler's actions at his Monday
postgame press conference.
"A guy was grabbing him or
something at the end and he retal-
iated in the wrong way," Rodri-
guez said in September 2008. "He
apologized for it, but you've still
got to keep your poise better than
that."
NOTES: Wide receiver Junior
Hemingway wore a green jer-
sey during Wednesday's prac-
tice, denoting limited contact.
Rodriguez said Hemingway also
practiced Tuesday and "looked
pretty good." Hemingway injured
his ankle two weeks ago dur-
ing his two-touchdown perfor-
mance against Western Michigan
and missed last Saturday's win
against Notre Dame. ...With right
guard David Moosman out with
a shoulder injury, redshirt junior
John Ferrara stepped in with the
No. 1 offense during yesterday's
practice. Ferrara, who switched
from defense to offense midway
through last season, started five
games last year at left guard.

first-round pick - Steve Slaton -
scored just four points last weekend.

Wolverines, along
with super-recruit
Evan King, hope to
learn from last year
By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Writer
Last year, the Michigan men's
tennis team entered its season
with high expectations.
Fifth-year coach Bruce Berque
was erasing years of mediocrity
and constructing one of the bet-
ter tennis programs in the Big
Ten, Michigan was coming off
two straight 20-win seasons after
not having one since 1988.
The team expected success and
in the beginning of the season, it
came. And then, so did the slump.
"We hit a patch where we
started thinking, 'We've arrived,'
" Berque said. "And we saw what
happened when we stopped lis-
tening, stopped working quite as
hard."
Michigan lost 11 of 13 matches
from Feb. 7 through March28 and
plummeted from No. 14 to No. 51
in the national rankings.
And while the Wolverines fin-
ished the season on a high note,
winning 10 of their last 11, Berque

thinks his team expected more.
"There were a few brightspots,"
he said. "But overall, we all feel
like it could have been better."
This year, Michigan is looking
to play well for the fall season,
which is centered more around
individual improvement, because
most tournaments are scored on
an individual basis.
It is then that veterans, like
juniors Jason Jung and Chris
Madden and seniors George
Navas and Mike Sroczynski, will
attempt to prove they learned
from last season.
They'll need to put those les-
sons to work with a tough non-
conference schedule during the
winter season, in which they play
No. 15 Kentucky and No. 17 Wake
Forest.
Their coach thinks they're
ready.
"I think they're going to take
some of those lessons they learned
(last season)," Berque said. "They
know that we've got more than
enough talent to have a very good
season."
By "more than enough talent,"
Berque is referring to the arrival
of highly-touted freshman Evan
King.
The freshman missed the first
week of classes to play in the Unit-
ed Stpates Open Juniors, where fe

try, Augustin Velotti of Argentina.
King was the No. 5 recruit nation-
ally, according to tennisrecruiting.
net, and Berque said he might be
the -most high-profile recruit in
Michigan tennis history.
But through it all, it sounds like
King has taken a page out of the
book of a fellow high-profile fresh-
man, current Michigan quarter-
back Tate Forcier:
"I don't think the pressure
affects me, because I don't put a
lot of pressure on myself, anyway,"
King said. "I just want to help the
team play well."
King is originally from Chi-
cago but moved to Florida after
his junior year in high school to
train full-time with the United
States Tennis Association High
Performance program while tak-
ing online classes through Laurel
Springs Prep Academy. He said
it's good to be back in the Mid-
west.
"I definitely missed it," King
said. "In Florida, there really isn't
a winter season, and I like indoor
tennis a lot."
King and the rest of the team
will have to play outdoor tennis
for at least another month. The
Wolverines' season kicks off at the
Napa Valley Invitational in St. Hel-
ena, California on Frijay.

A BAD BITE FOR A GOOD CAUSE

Greek leaders: Rush not
affected by poor economy

Panhel, IFC report
'nearly identical'
numbers compared
to previous years
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
This year, don't expect the
parade of girls down Hill Steet to
slow, despite the struggling econ-
omy.
Neither the Interfraternity
Council nor the Panhellenic Asso-
ciation - the University's largest
Greek councils - have noticed
a dip in the number of students
interested in joining Greek life in
spite of a record unemployment
rate in Michigan and economic
woes acros4 the country.
Mary Beth Seiler, director of the
University's Office ofGreek Life, said
Panhel officials were pleased to see
the number of potential new mem-
bers is almost identical to last year's.
"It was a pleasant surprise for
us," she said.
According to IFC President Ari
Parritz, their mass meeting had
one of the largest turnouts he has
seen in recent years.
"My freshman year, for example,
though we weren't in a big eco-
nomic crisis, if you want to call it
that, we had maybe half to three
quarters less people than we had
present this year," he said.
Parritz said an increase in the
number of fraternities on campus
could be a reason for the higher
numbers of participants, since
the IFC hasn't changed any of its
advertising tactics.
"We're fortunate that our num-
bers continue to grow," he said,
"and that we continue to be an

attractive source for students with
many people realizing early on that
Greek Life is a great way to find
your place."
Parritz said Greek Life officials
have been worried about the eco-
nomic impact on rush for the past
couple of years, but their concerns
haven't materialized.
"Peoplewereaskingaboutitinthe
winter and in the year before, butwe
haven't noticed any downturn in our
numbers," he said. "The numbers
were up in the winter in the height
of the crisis and they haven't shown
any sign they'll go down."
Seiler said students who are
concerned about the costs of rush
should consult Panhel's website
wherefinancialinformationisread-
ily accessible. According to Panhel's
website, sorority dues range from
$900 to $2,300 and are decided on
an individual chapter basis.
According to a Daily article from
Feb. 10, the IFC doesn't publicly
release the cost of rush.
Panhel President Rachael
Reeves wrote in an e-mail that she
hasn't received too many questions
from potential new members about
the costs of joining a sorority.
She added that she thinks many
realize it can be a good deal to join
the Greek community.
"Sorority dues go toward things
such as having a great chef so that
you do not have to make your own
meals, sisterhood events, and other
things that generally really enrich
your experience here at U of M,"
she wrote in the e-mail.
To alleviate any financial con-
cerns, the two councils do offer
scholarship opportunities.
Parritz said the IFC is sponsor-
ing eight new scholarships this
year, worth about $1,000 each.
"We recognize the need and
the large commitment it takes to

become part of the Greek commu-
nity," he said. "Since (IFC's) financ-
es are flexible, instead of creating
another program we wanted to
give it back to the community into
the area that needs it most -which
is the new members."
Reeves said the individual
sororities offer many scholarship
opportunities to their members
once they have joined the soror-
ity. She said Panhel also offers
other opportunities like the ones
funded by the Junior Panhel
fundraiser.
Since the Multicultural Greek
Council holds recruitment later in
the year, it's still not clear how the
economy will affect rush, Carmen
Loo, MGC's vice president, wrote
in an e-mail.
"Students are very worried about
their economic situations, especial-
ly with the costs of dues and rush,"
she wrote in the e-mail. Therefore,
"people might be reluctant to go
throughthe recruitment process."
Loo said new members often ask
about the costs of Greek Life dur-
ing recruitment, but MGC doesn't
have a number to give them most of
the time because each house han-
dles their dues differently.
"Each organization works dili-
gently to lower costs by giving
out more scholarships," Loo said.
"Many organizations have also
increased their fundraising efforts
by providing fundraisers and pro-
grams that canpotentiallyincrease
houses' treasury."
She added: "MGC organizations
especially have been keeping up
with scholarship funds and trying
to help new members as much as
possible."

INNOCENCE CLINIC

argue new evidence suggests Vin-
son spent 23 years in a cell at the G.
Robert Cotton Correctional Facil-
ity in Jackson, Mich. for a crime he
didn't commit.
Law Prof. David Moran, the other
co-director of the Innocence Clinic,
called the case a "scientific train
wreck;' adding that the new evidence
"conclusively exonerates" Vinson.
During the trial, Vinson present-
ed multiple witnesses who testified
he was at his mother's home at the
time of the crime, the brief states.
But the prosecution had what
the jury found to be damning evi-
dence - evidence, it turns out, that
is completely false.
A mixed blood and semen stain
was found at the crime scene on
the victim's bed sheet and sent for
forensic testing in 1986 to the now-
defunct Detroit police crime lab.
Paula Lytle, a police forensic ex-
aminer, testified that her tests on
Vinson's blood sample showed him
to be a non-secretor, meaning his
blood type does not reveal itself in
his bodily fluids other than blood.
Another police examiner, Officer
Robert Lloyd, also testified at the tri-
al. Lloyd said that fingerprints were
not found at the crime scene. Lloyd
told the jury that a "non-secretor"
is less likely to leave fingerprints be-
cause he or she perspires less.

clear that she will draw the line at
dangerous cuts that would hurt citi-
zens or harm our ability to grow the
economy and create jobs," said Liz
Boyd, Granholm's press secretary.
Rep. Pam Byrnes (D-Lyndon
Twp.) said the House's Democratic
caucus proposed allocating funds
for four key areas including the
Michigan PromiseScholarship, early
childhood education, police and fire
safety, and Medicaid coverage.
Byrnes said although Demo-
crats in the state want to increase
revenue through higher taxes, that
option is complicated by the Michi-
gan's current economic state. The
Republican-controlled Senate is
also unwilling to raise taxes as a
means of creating more revenue.
"The only other alternative is to
generate more revenue of which
would mean more taxes to people,"
Byrnes said. "And now we have the
highest unemployment rate in the
nation, and doing the general tax
increase would not be very well re-
ceived by the citizens of Michigan
at this time."
Sen. Liz Brater (D-Ann Arbor)
agrees with the solution of raising
taxes to help fund the state's vari-
ous commitments.
"There's a number of ways we
could solve the problem, but basi-
cally the kind of cuts they're talk-
ing about are very draconian and
they're not going to be able to pro-
vide needed essential state services
unless we provide some additional
revenue," she said.
"The problem is that there's se-
rious philosophical disagreement
between the leadership of the Sen-
ate and the House about what is
the role of state government," she

brief, is that Lloyd did not clarify
for the jury that by "non-secretor"
he meant a person who excretes
very little or no oils from his or her
skin, and has nothingto do with the
type of non-secretor Lytle's tests
had shown Vinson to be.
The Detroit crime lab, which
conducted the tests back in 1986,
was shut down last fall after an ex-
ternal audit found a slew of errors
in the lab's analyses in murder and
other crime cases over the years.
Wayne County Prosecutor Kym
Worthy told The Associated Press
last September that the audit found
erroneous or false findings in 10
percent of 200 random cases tested
and subpar quality control compli-
ance overall at the lab.
The audit also demonstrated a
"shocking level of incompetence"
in the lab, constituting a systemic
problem, said Worthy at a news
conference last fall. The lab met
only 42 percent of a required 100
percent of recognized work stan-
dards, Worthy said.
In a report published in Febru-
ary, Dr. Judith Westrick, an associ-
ate chemistry professor at Lake Su-
perior State University, re-analyzed
blood and saliva samples from Vin-
son. Westrick's tests found Vinson
to be an AB secretor, meaning that
both A and B blood antigens should
have been found in the semen stain
found at the scene of the rape.
Because A and B blood antigens
were not found at the crime scene,
the brief argues, "Vinson could
not have been responsible for this

crime."
Additional testing conducted
in 2009 showed the semen to be
that of someone with blood type
O, further exonerating Vinson for
the crime, according to Innocence
Clinic officials.
"If blood type O antigens came
from the semen source, then Mr.
Vinson could not be the semen
source because the forensic analy-
sis would have detected the pres-
ence of A and B blood types, but
only found type O," the brief reads.
"Therefore, Mr. Vinson could not
have been responsible forthis crime
because his blood type should have
been detected in the sheet stain but
was not detected!'
At the press conference yester-
day, Karl's brother, Robert Vinson,
said Vinson's conviction and in-
carceration has taken a toll on his
whole family, especially his mother,
who has had to live with the knowl-
edge her son has been in jail for 23
years for a crime he didn't commit.
MoransaidVinsonhasmaintained
his innocence throughout, adding
that he has been denied parole sev-
eral times because he has refused to
admitcguilt to the parole board.
Innocence Clinic officials are cur-
rently waiting for Judge Vera Massey
Jones to decide on the case. There is
no timeframe for that process,though
Moran said he's confident it will get
resolved soon, as Jones is known for
keeping a clean docket.

continued, "that makes it difficult
to come to these necessary compro-
mises."
According to Bauer, there is a
$232 million difference between
the House and Senate's higher edu-
cation budgets, which is due in part
to the House's full funding of the
Michigan Promise Grants at $140
million.
Byrnes said the state has federal
stimulus money from the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act
that can provide a cut of the fund-
ing for state universities, but that
the Promise Scholarship was not
included in these funds.
"We're able to use those federal
funds to do this, so there should be
no cuts actually to the operating ex-
penses of the universities," Byrnes
said. "And that's why the proposal
of the Senate was to cut the promise
grant because that was not tied into
the operating expenses."
The University planned their
budget for the 2009-2010 academic
year according to estimations based
on state appropriations of $316
million, according to Cynthia Wil-
banks, the University's vice presi-
dent for government relations.
"That is the requirement under
the federal stimulus program that
the state must maintain funding at
the 2006 fiscal year level," she said.
According to Wilbanks, the Uni-
versity's funding from the state,
which is at about 22 to 23 percent
of the general fund, has steadily
declined since 2002, when state
funding for the University was at its
peak at $363 million.
"It's certainly a reflection today
of the downturn in the economy in
the state of Michigan and I think all
of us who rely in some way on state
support know that the current ex-
penditures of the state are not sus-
tainable based on the current rev-
enues that the state is receiving, so

something's got to give" Wilbanks
said.
Bauer said the conference com-
mittees, appointed by the House
Speaker and the Senate Majority
Leader during their meeting yester-
day, will work to forge compromises
and solve the differences between
the two bodies.
Those conference committee re-
ports will then be presented as a re-
vised budget to the full House and
Senate.
According to Bauer, after these
reports are created, the House and
Senate cannot further amend the
budget and can only vote it up or
down.
Brater said while the legislature
is trying to prevent a government
shutdown through these recent ne-
gotiations between legislative lead-
ers, she has heard word of a possible
continuation budget, which would
involve a resolution that extends
the currentyear's budget for a short
period.
"It's possible we could have a
continuation budget. I've heard talk
of that to reenact a single budget
temporarilyuntil we solve the prob-
lems," Brater said. "But that would
be somewhat only a short-term fix
because there's not enough money
in this current fiscal year's budget.
I mean there's more money being
spent in the fiscal year's budget
than we currently have to spend."
Brater said the only sector in
which she supports cuts is the De-
partment of Corrections.
"That of course is very contro-
versial but we need to be shifting
what we're spending in correc-
tions to preventative programs and
to prevent criminalization later in
life," Brater said. "I think we know
what we need to do to stabilize this
economy and certainly invest in
higher education is key for the 21st
century workforce."

Obama won't
make 'quick'
decision on
Afghanistan

WALKING ON WIRE

On Tuesday, Adm.
Mullen said a troop
increase was needed
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama said yesterday
there will be no quick decision on
whether to send more U.S. troops
into the widening war in Afghani-
stan, saying "my determination is
to get this right."
The president's comments
came one day after Adm. Mike
Mullen, his top military adviser
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, endorsed an increase in
U.S. forces as likely necessary to
battle a deepening insurgency.
The U.S. and NATO commander
in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley
McChrystal, also has delivered a
grim assessment of the war and is
expected to follow up soon with
a request for thousands of addi-
tional troops.
"I'm going to take a very delib-
erate process in making those
decisions," said Obama, taking
questions from reporters as he sat
in the Oval Office with visiting
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper. "And so I just want to be
absolutely clear, because there's
been a lot of discussion in the press
about this: There is no immediate
decision pending on resources."
Even as Obama spoke about a
methodical war review, admin-
istration officials were briefing
key lawmakers on McChrystal's
review and on White House pro-
posals for 46 benchmarks to gauge

progress in the stalemated Afghan
war and the hunt for al-Qaida in
neighboring Pakistan.
The Obama administration's
road map to winning the war in
Afghanistan relies heavily on
clearing terrorists from Pakistan,
according to the list of bench-
marks provided to lawmakers.
Stabilizing Pakistan always has
been a key part of the administra-
tion's strategy for South Asia. But
its prominence in the long-await-
ed benchmarks for the Afghan
war signals a longer regional view
than just gauging whether the
conflict is being won.
"It's going to be much broader
than justcombattroops," Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Commit-
tee, said after beingbriefed by top
Obama administration officials
yesterday about an on-the-ground
assessment of the situation in
Afghanistan. "Everybody ought to
realize that this is a much broader
issue than that."
His Republican counterpart on
the committee, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., emerged from the brief-
ing calling the proposed Obama
benchmarks "a start," but not spe-
cific enough.
The president has already
ordered 21,000 more troops to
Afghanistan, increasing the U.S.
commitment there to 68,000 by
year's end.Yetviolence inAfghan-
istan has soared to record levels.
More U.S. troops - 51 - died in
Afghanistan in August than in
any other month since the U.S.-led
invasion in October 2001.

Slain Yale student was suffocated,
medical examiner reports to police



Police: Raymond
Clark III 'person of
interest' in killing
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A
Yale graduate student found stuffed
in the wall of a research center had
been suffocated, the medical exam-
iner reported yesterday as police
awaited DNA tests on evidence
taken from a lab technician who
worked in the building.
Police call Raymond Clark III a
"person of interest" in the slaying
of Annie Le. Authorities hoped to
compare DNA taken from Clark's
hair, fingernails and saliva with
more than 250 pieces of evidence
collected at the crime scene on
the Ivy League campus and from
Clark's Middletown, Conn., apart-
ment.
"It's all up to the lab now," Police
Chief James Lewis said at a news
conference. "The basis of the inves-
tigation now is really on the physi-
cal evidence."
Police served two search war-
rants - for DNA from Clark and for
items in his apartment - late Tues-
day. They served two more yester-
day morning, for more items from
the apartment and for Clark's Ford
Mustang, Lewis said.
Investigators said they expect
to determine within days whether
Clark should be charged in the kill-
ing. He was escorted in handcuffs

from his apartment and released
early Wednesday into the custody
of his attorney, police said.
Lewis said Clark and several
other people are under constant
police surveillance. He said police
expect to seek an arrest warrant for
anyone whose DNA matches evi-
dence at the crime scene.
Clark is not talking to police,
Lewis said.
"Atsome pointhe maybe willingto
answer questions, but at this pointhe
has invoked his rights," Lewis said.
"He has an attorney. We couldn't
question him if we wanted to."
Clark's attorney, David Dwor-
ski, said his client is "committed to
proceeding appropriately with the
authorities." He would not elaborate.
A police lab is expediting tests on
Clark's DNA. University of Connect-
icut genetics professor Linda Straus
Baugh says testing can be done in
days ifa case gets top priority.
Clark's job as an animal-services
technician at Yale put him in con-
tact with Le, who worked for a Yale
laboratory that conducted experi-
ments on mice. She was part of a
research team headed by her faculty
adviser, Anton Bennett, that focused
on enzyme research that could have
implications in cancer, diabetes and
muscular dystrophy. Members of
the team have declined to comment
on the case or their work.
Clark, his fiancee, his sister and
his brother-in-law all work for Yale
as animal lab technicians.

Le's body was found Sunday
stuffed behind the wall of the base-
ment where lab animals are kept.
The Connecticut state medical
examiner said Wednesday that Le
died of "traumatic asphyxiation."
Authorities released no details
on how she died, but traumatic
asphyxiation could be consistent
with a choke hold or some other
form of pressure-induced asphyxi-
ation caused by a hand or an object,
such as a pipe.
Clark and Le were both 24
years old, but Clark has a muscular
build that contrasts sharply to Le's
4-foot-11, 90-pound frame. Clark
also reportedly had a troubling
brush with the law in high school
after being accused of harassing a
girlfriend.
Until recently, Clark's family
lived in nearby Branford, a small
middle-class suburb of New Haven.
In September 2003, when he was
a senior at Branford High School,
Clark reportedly upset a girlfriend
so much that police warned him to
stay away from her.
The New Haven Independent
reported that when the girl tried to
break up with Clark, he attempted to
confront her and wrote on her locker.
The girlfriend and her mother
told a detective that she had been
in a sexual relationship with Clark
and that he once forced her to have
sex. The relationship continued
after that incident, according to the
Independent, a news Web site.

The youngwoman did not pursue
the case, and no charges were filed.
TheIndependentreportedthatClark
waswarnedin2003thatpolicecould
pursue criminal charges against him
if he contacted the girl.
Branford Police Lt. Geoffrey
Morgan told The Associated Press
on Wednesday that his department
would not release the unsubstanti-
ated 2003 report. Morgan would
neither confirm nor deny the news
report, citing cooperation with
police investigating the killing.
Clark played baseball at Bran-
ford High School, where longtime
athletic director Artie Roy remem-
bered him as a quiet student who
threw a mean knuckleball.
"He was a seriously good pitch-
er and a good infielder," Roy said.
"He wasn't a typical off-the-wall
knucklehead kind of kid who
bounced all over the place," he
said. Clark also participated in
clubs that raised money for chari-
ty and the Asian Awareness group,
according to the school's 2004
yearbook, the Milestone.
On her MySpace page, Clark's
fiancee, Jennifer Hromadka, calls
Clark was a "wonderful boyfriend."
She added that she'snot perfect, but
cautioned people not to judge her.
"Who are you to judge the life I
live? I know I'm not perfect and I
don't live to be, but before you start
pointing fingers make sure your
hands are clean!!" the 23-year-old
wrote.

CIA Director Leon Panetta addresses the media in Dearborn yesterday.

In Dearborn, CIA
chief said al-Qaida
remains a threat
DEARBORN, Mich. - The
director of the CIA beseeched
Arab-American and Muslim lead-
ers yesterday to join efforts to
reduce the threat of terrorism in
the U.S.
Speaking in the heart of Michi-
gan's large Middle Eastern Com-
munity, Leon Panetta said the
country is safer than it was when
it was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001,
though al-Qaida still remains a
threat.
"I need you. The nation needs
you," Panetta said during a
25-minute speech to about 150
people at an iftar, the evening
meal that breaks the fast during
the Islamic holy month of Rama-
dan.
The address represented one of
the Central Intelligence Agency's
highest-profile recruiting efforts
aimed at Arab-Americans and
Muslims. Panetta said it was his
first speech at a Ramadan break-
fast dinner.
Theagencythisyearannounced
a five-year plan to boost fluency in
Arabic and other languages the
CIA deems critical to its work.
Panetta aims to raise foreign lan-
guage proficiency inside the CIA
from less than a third to at least

half of all analysts and intelli-
gence operatives.
He told the gatheringhe hopes
to increase the share of the
agency's work force that has for-
eign language skills. The agency
seeks highly skilled workers in
90 different areas, including
analysts, engineers and doctors,
he said.
"We have to reflect the face of
this nation, and we have to reflect
the face of the world," said Panet-
ta, drawing applause from the
gathering.
Earlier, he told reporters
he never considered resigning
from the job he took in Febru-
ary, despite a battle with Attor-
ney General Eric Holder over
Holder's his decision to investi-
gate some agency officials in past
interrogations of terrorism case
detainees.
"My concern is ... that we don't
get trapped by the past. My feel-
ing is ultimately, we're going to
be able to move on," Panetta said.
"I think the reason I felt the way
I did is because I don't believe
there's a basis there for any kind
of additional action."
He also sought to allay concerns
of many in the Arab and Muslim
communities who say they have
felt the sting of suspicion and dis-
crimination since Sept. 11. About
300,000 people with roots in the
Arab world live in the Detroit
area.

music that we listen to down there,"
he said. "There's this one song called
'Stanky Leg' Yeah, I know. And that
gets me into my groove."
As for the canned music's rela-
tionship with the band, Riordan
said the Athletic Department is not
"trying to take away anything from
the Michigan Marching Band.'
However, a marchingband mem-
ber who didn't feel authorized to
speak on the subject and requested
anonymity, told the Daily that the
band resents the pumped-in music.
"I appreciate where the players
are coming from in that it can help
motivate them," the band member
said, "but when you have one of the
best marching bands sitting there
waiting to play, at times it's some-
what disappointing to hea rmusic
coming over the loudspeakers."
Riordan said the band shouldn't
feel edged out, since the canned
music is only played in short clips.
How much canned music is
played and when it's played de-
pends upon each individual game.
"Ideally we want to play right be-
fore the team comes out of the tun-
nel, when the band is not playing,"
Riordan said. "We don't have any
set spots, we are really just trying to
go with the flow and feel what the
crowd is like at the time and play
what's appropriate."
"It's nicely intermixed with
cheering," said LSA senior Natalie
Wengroff.
LSA senior Adam Lynn specu-
lated the change could work in the
Wolverines' favor on the field when
they need it most.
"It's a home field advantage to get
the crowd rallied up like that," he
said. "I think it will be the deciding
factor for us against Ohio State."

President of the AFL-CIO Richard Trumka addresses the AFL-CIO convention in Pittsburgh Tuesday.
Former coal miner leads AFL-CIO

Richard Trumka is
first new AFL-CIO
president in 14 years
PITTSBURGH (AP) - Richard
Trumka, who rose from the coal
mines of Pennsylvania to the top
ranks of the nation's labor move-
ment, took the helm of the AFL-
CIO yesterday, ushering in a more
aggressive style of leadership and
vowing to revive unions' sagging
membership rolls.
The first new AFL-CIO presi-
dent in 14 years, Trumka pledged
to make the labor movement
appeal to a new generation of
workers who perceive unions as
"only a grainy, faded picture from
another time."
"We need a unionism that
makes sense to the next genera-
tion - young women and men who
either don't have the money to go
to college or are almost penniless
by the time they come out," Trum-

ka told hundreds of cheering del-
egates in a speech at their annual
convention.
Trumka, 60, a charismatic,
former head of the United Mine
Workers, embraced the challenge
of rebuilding union ranks that
have fallen from a high of 35 per-
cent in the 1950s to just 12.4 per-
cent today.
It's a feat his predecessor, John
Sweeney, failed to accomplish as
the U.S. continued to lose mil-
lions of manufacturing jobs and
employers grew more resistant to
union organizers.
Trumka insisted that unions
remain the best way to lift work-
ers into the middle class during a
time of economic turmoil. He said
the growing number of Americans
working as temps, contractors
and telecommuters are "walking
a tightrope without a net" as they
work for low wages, no health care
and little job security.
"Even though it wasn't the labor
movement that got us into this

mess, we are the people who are
going to lead America out of it," he
declared.
Trumka plans to be a more
vocal and visible spokesman for
labor's cause than Sweeney was.
That includes more events, more
public speaking and more TV and
radio appearances.
"Richie is probably more force-
ful than John," said Gerald McEn-
tee, president of the American
Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees. "John had
the workers' interest in his heart,
but Richie has them in his heart
and his gut."
With a union-friendly Demo-
crat in the White House and
Democrats in control of Congress,
unions have their best chance in
decades of getting their top pri-
ority: overhauling labor laws to
make it easier for workers to form
unions. If that happens, labor lead-
ers predict a renaissance in orga-
nized labor, with millions of new
workers signing up.

Gators ready to whup Kiffin'sVols

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Writer
Many first-year coaches
want to believe that their
team's play on the field will "do
the talking."
But Lane Kiffin is not like
many first-year coaches.
Before his Tennessee Volun-
teers team even took the field,
Kiffin felt it necessary to trash
talk one of the Southeastern
Conference's most established
coaches, Florida coach Urban
Meyer.
* "Just so you know, when a
recruit's on another campus,you
can't call a recruit on another
campus," said Kiffin in Febru-
ary of the recruitment referring
to NuKeese Richardson. "I love
the fact that Urban had to cheat
and still didn't get him."
The comments caused a
firestorm of media attention
including NCAA reprimands
and a demand for a Kiffin
apology fromi Florida Athletic
Director Jeremy Foley.
But the Gators still have a bad
taste in their mouth, and Lane
Kiffin is still as smug as ever.
This Saturday, Kiffin gets
a chance for his coaching to
catch up with his talking as the
Vols take on the top-ranked
Gators in The Swamp.
The Gators have made it no
secret that Kiffin's comments
are providing them with extra
incentive to win this week's
game. That must be terrify-
ing for the Volunteers. Kiffin's

comments pissed off Heisman
winner Tim Tebow, who has
the whole world, media and
other various mystical powers
rallying behind him. If I recall
correctly, the last time Tebow
was riled up -- following Flor-
ida's lost to Mississippi last
year -- the Gators rattled off 11
straight double-digit wins.
So strap in, Lane Kiffin. I
hear Tebow is a big fan of "an
eye for an eye."

As the Michigan football
team heads into this weekend,
fans already feel like their for-
tunes have turned.
With an upset over Notre
Dame, atop-25 rankingand two
straight games where the Wol-
verines are likely to be favored
by double-digit points, all signs
point to a breakthrough season.
But around the Big Ten, the
questionsthathaunted the Wol-
verines ayear ago - quarterback
play, whether or not they were
legitimate contenders and head
coach job security - have been
passed to their brethren.
This week's slate of games
will go a long way to answering
some of those concerns.
MICH. STATE AT
NOTRE DAME
The Spartans head to South
Bend with the same blank
expressions that the Irish wore
last week, as both teams try to
figure out what happened in
their previous last-second loss-
es. They both know they can't
afford another. The loser of this
game will probably head into a
downward spiral for the rest of
the season.
Michigan State coach Mark
Dantonio continues to field
the most prominent question
posed to Michigan's coach Rich
Rodriguez: Who is the starting
quarterback? Kirk Cousins took
a majority of the snaps in the
loss to Central, but Oklahoma
transfer Keith Nichol has the
legs and arguably more talent.
Whoever plays the majority
of the snaps willbe forced to put

up some big numbers to make
up for a weak secondary that
gave up 352 passing yards to the
Chippewas. If Notre Dame can
get huge performances from
their two NFL-caliber wide-
outs, Michael Floyd and Golden'
Tate, the Irish could go beyond
the 400-yard mark again.
Even with all that offense,
expect this one to still be hard-
hitting as both teams fight for
their seasons.
RATING:
NO.8 CAL AT MINNESOTA
Minnesota has chosen to go
down the path Michigan took
last year.
The Wolverines upset ninth-
ranked Wisconsin at home, and
many wondered whether it was
a sign of things to come or a
lucky outcome against an over-
rated team.
If Minnesota can beat No. 8
Cal approximately a year later,
many of those same people will
wonder about which way the
season will go.
On paper, Cal's Jahvid Best
should run around, over and
through Minnesota's defense.
However, the Gophers have
all upperclassmen starters
on defense, and no piece of
paper can value veteran lead-
ership. Look for them to make
life tough for Cal quarterback
Kevin Riley.
In addition, it will be the first
big game in the newly-opened
TCF Bank Stadium, which
means the crowd will be as
loud as it has ever been for the
Gophers. Throw in the jet lag

ARIZONA AT IOWA
Even in a matchup of 2-0
teams, both coaches face a
dangerous question: are they
secretly on the hot seat?
Arizona's Mike Stoops is in
his sixth year with the Wild-
cats but has given them just one
season over .500. On the other
sideline is Kirk Ferentz. After
two conference titles in three
years, the Hawkeyes have fallen
into Big Ten mediocrity.
The expectations were high
this year, with many pundits
predicting a top-three confer-
ence finish for Iowa. That fin-
ish, along with Ferentz's job
security, could be in jeopardy
after needing two blocked kicks
to squeak out a one-point vic-
tory over Northern Iowa.
Both teams are in similar situ-
ations with young squads trying
to replace star players. Iowa's
Shonn Greene has jumped to
the NFL only to be replaced by
Adam Robinson at runningback.
Arizona must replace its three-
yearstartingquarterback,Willie
Tuitama, with sophomore Matt
Scott. Scott threw just 11 passes
a year ago.
The game might be close, and
it certainly matters, but it prob-
ably won't be well-played.

MAN ON A MISSION
After two years as a Mormon missionary,
Chase Tennant is back with the Wolverines

I
I

SAID ALSALAH/Daily

Junior Chase Tennant is back on the Michigan men's soccer team after a two-year hiatus, during which he lived in Portland, Ore. as a missionary for the Mormon church.

By JAKE FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
For too long, he desperately
tried to convince his companion
to accompany him on a run, but to
no avail. His companion refused to
leave the apartment and he could
not leave his companion, so he was

stuck. No running.
Such was life on a Mormon Mis-
sion in Portland, Ore. for junior soc-
cer player Chase Tennant. So after
almost two years of living with
various companions, he returned
to Ann Arbor out of shape and 12
pounds too heavy. Tennant had
been far removed from pop culture,

current events, academics, and soc-
cer, and obviously had some catch-
ing up to do.
Back in 2004, Tennant was still
a highly touted high school soccer
recruit in Rochester. His family was
extremely involved in the Mormon
Church, and Tennant was already
planning to take a mission trip dur-
inghis college years.
"Ever since I was a young kid,
I was always brought up under
the church," Tennant said. "It's
always played abigpartinmy fam-
ily's life as well as mine. I think
that's why, my whole life, I had
the goal of going on a mission was
because from a young age, I was
taught about the principles of the
church."
Tennantinformed schools of his
intentions and anxiously awaited
inquiries from soccer coaches at
major programs. Akron and Bos-
ton College both refused Tennant
a scholarship, fearful that a two-
year absence from the team might
interfere with the chemistry of the
squad. But Michigan coach Steve
Burns was already experienced in
the mission process. Cam Camer-
on, a redshirt freshman on Burns's
2004 team, was preparing to leave
for a mission in Montreal later that
year, so Burns took his chances on
Tennant. The gamble paid divi-
dends right away.
Tennant immediately startedfor
the Wolverines at defense and mid-
field, earning Big Ten All-Fresh-
man Honors. He shined once again
sophomore year and even garnered
serious attention from the Colum-
bus Crew, a professional team that
offered Tennant a tryout. After the
conclusion of the season, he bade

his coaches and teammates fare-
well and embarked on his two-year
mission trip.
The first stop was a missionary
training center in Provo, Utah. For
two months, Tennant underwent
intensive Spanish classes coupled
with religious seminars to further
his understanding of the Mormon
principles. He was sent to relay
these messages in Portland, Ore.,
Tennant's home for the following
22 months.
During this span of time, Ten-
nant's relationship with soccer
drastically changed. After living
and breathing soccer asa Division-I
athlete, his playing was now lim-
ited to a weekly pickup game in a
local gym.
"The competition that I was
playing against when I was out
there wasn't very high," Tennant
said. "So Iwas kind of on my own to
keep up my skill and my fitness."
But Tennant's strict schedule
allowed for merely 30 minutes of
free time for conditioning each
day. Even this half hour was con-
strained by the wishes of Tennant's
companion. Companions shared
apartments in the Portland metro-
politan area and rotated every few
months. The two were required to
remain within eyesight and earshot
of one another at all times.
Tennant's life was tightly struc-
tured. He woke up at 6:30 a.m. and
slept at 10:30 p.m. He spent most
days knocking on doors and arrang-
ing appointments to teach people
about the Mormon Church. He
aimed at serving people in whatev-
er capacity he could, often assisting
with yard work alongside his fellow
missionaries. After massive storms

hit Portland in December 2007,
Tennant helped restore the com-
munity by clearing the wreckage. .
"One of the things that I gained
most from my mission is learning
to kind of forget about myself and
put myself in other people's shoes,"
Tennantsaid. "To kind of see every-
one as equals, trying to help every-
one and anyone rather than being
egotistical and just thinking about
my own well-being."
Tennant's service to the Mormon
Church ended last December. He
was ready to come home,yetunpre-
pared for the severe transition that
lay ahead. Tennant had changed
significantly in the past two years,
and so had Ann Arbor. Only three
players from his sophomore sea-
son remained on the squad. Most
of Tennant's previous teammates
had either graduated already or
were graduating in the spring. His
parents had moved to Chicago, and
he lacked the support system nec-
essary to endure such a tough time.
Although the two had never met,
Cameron reached out to Tennant
and the two became quick friends.
"Right when he got back, I called
him often,". Cameron said. "Of
course when you go on a mission,
most of the guys that you know on
the team have graduated, so the first
thing we did was hang out with the
team a lot. I asked him to come out
with some friends and we would go
out to either parties or get-togeth-
ers or church activities."
Although Cameron alleviated
the stresses of the social transition,
Tennant was forced to recondition
his body alone.
"When I got back I was pretty
out of shape," Tennant said. "I

remember the first couple weeks,
we would play pick up soccer here
in Oosterbahn (Fieldhouse) and I
just felt out of place. I felt alot slow-
er. I guess my spirits were down for
a while."
As a result, he worked harder.
Tennant desperately tried to hurry
the training process, but ultimately
injuredhis ankle, requiringsurgery
in February. He continued to train
while rehabilitating his ankle, mak-
ing great progress in the summer
months. Tennant's attitude quickly
impressed his new teammates and
reinforced Burns's decision to give
him a scholarship.
"He's comeback amanverysim-
ply," Burns said. "He's a guy that
his teammates all like being around
andhe knows whentohave fun. But
he also knows when to be a serious
and when to be a leader and address
guys that need to raise their level of
play."
Tennant reclaimed his role as
a starter and was named assistant
captain before the season began.
In his second game back, Michigan
and Drake were tied late in the sec-
ond half. In the 88th minute, Ten-
nant found the ball 25 yards out.
And as ifhe never missed a beat,the
22-year old junior ripped a shot just
below the crossbar.
"As soon as the ball went into
the goal, I just didn't know what to
do," Tennant said. "I was just kind
of in shock. I just started running
around. It really helped me feellike,
'Ah I'm part of this team again.' I'm
kind of putting my stamp, I'm put-
ting my foot back down and people
can start thinking, 'Alright this is
the Chase that we've been waiting
for.'"

By JAKE FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
When Michigan's leading goal
scorer Mauro Fuzetti limped off
the field in the 11th minute of
last night's game with a hyperex-
tended knee, the entire Wolver-
ine men's soccer team looked as
though it needed treatment. The
Wolver-
ines were MICHIGAN 3
being out- DETROIT MERCY 1
hustled,
outplayed and outmatched by a
University of Detroit Mercy team
that had only notched one win on
the season.
Then, in the 56th minute,
Fuzetti reentered the game, and
the Wolverines were cured. Mich-
igan (5-1) erased a one-goal deficit
with a dominant second half to
secure a 3-1victory.
Without Fuzetti to lead the
scoring attack in the first period,
Michigan's offense lacked cohe-
sion. Wolverine midfielders relied
greatly on long balls while for-
wards appeared intent on pen-
etrating the defense one-on-one.
The Michigan team that had
thrived all season on extended
possessions and extra passes had
disappeared.
"Guys get a little bit nervous,
maybe," senior captain Danny
Gray said. "We still have young
guys and they're still becom-
ing accustomed to the Division I
game. They get out here, it's game
day under the lights. They want to
show off in front of their family

Wolverines. But when the forward
did return, his presence was felt
immediately.
In Michigan's next offensive
sequence, Junior defender Adam
Keller threw a long pass into the
attacking box where the ball was
deflected towards Fuzetti. The
star forward met the ball in the
air with his left foot and blasted it
into the net to equalize the score
at one.
"He could have started (the
second half), but once the energy
and adrenaline kind of comes out
of the game, you can put a player
like Mauro Fuzetti in, and he can
really have an impact," Michigan
coach Steve Burns said.
His impact resonated with the
Wolverines through the remain-
der of the second half. They out-
shot Detroit 9-5 in the period and
quickly thwarted any hope of a
Titans' comeback.
Freshman midfielder Hamoody
Saad scored his second goal in two
games on a free kick, a shot he bent
around Detroit goalkeeper Bran-
don Waterstradt.
Junior defender Jeff Quihano
added a late goal for good mea-
sure, and the Wolverines were able
to rectify the disastrous opening
stanza.
"We're just having a hard time
feeling teams out, I guess," Gray
said. "It just takes us so long to
get accustomed to the fact that
we can beat these teams. I don't
know what the problem is, we
just gotta come out with more
confidence."

TRAILER REVIEW
UP IN THE AIR
PARAMOUNT
"Up in the Air" was critically lauded as one of the best pictures of the year at the
Telluride Film Festival, and with its artfully constructed trailer audiences should
have high expectations for its release this fall. In the trailer a very lonely-looking
George Clooney lyrically narrates disheartening advice behind a montage of stun-
ning aerial shots and wordless thespian interactions. Still, the trailer gives almost
nothing away about the film's plot. The movie looks to have a strong ensemble of
comedic actors, featuringJason Bateman of "Arrested Development" fame and Vera
Farmiga ("The Departed"). This justglows with Oscar potential.

SAADI AND UP HILL PRODUCTIONS

Laith al-Saadi and Jill Jack were two of the many artists showcased at this summer's Sonic Lunch series

A satisfying Lunch

Local concert series just
capped off a successful
summer of music
By MIKE KUNTZ
Daily Arts Writer
Everyone loves food, music and free
stuff. It's a rare happening when a local
event combines all three, even more so
in an inviting, engaging and communal
way. Sonic Lunch, a free concert series
in downtown Ann Arbor, did just this
over the past summer - and with tre-
mendous results.
Held every Thursday afternoon from
the first week in June to the second week
of September in Liberty Plaza (the park
at the corner of Liberty and Division),
the event brought together an assorted
mix of local music and cuisine. Perform-
ers played on a stage in the middle of the
park while local restaurants set up shop
in the square.
Musicians ranged from veteran per-
formers to up-and-coming locals. The
Sonic Lunch lineup this year included
The Macpodz, The Ragbirds, Jill Jack,
Tumbao Bravo, Laith al-Saadi, Shout
Sister Shout and several others.
The concert series's genesis began
three years ago as the brainchild of
local entrepreneurs and music aficio-
nados Hal Davis and Michael Cole, who
sought to make an informal music series
with an emphasis on local culture. After
gaining corporate sponsorship and rec-
ognition from Bank of Ann Arbor, the
Ann Arbor Chamber of Commerce and
local radio station 107one, the event
known as Sonic Lunch was born.
"It's like a Concert in the Park series
- something you might see anywhere,"
said Erin Zindle, lead singer, songwrit-
er and multi-instrumentalist of The
Ragbirds. "But in a town as culturally
vibrant as Ann Arbor, it makes for some-
thing completely different."
The Ragbirds, originally from Ann
Arbor, play a blend of traditional and
contemporary folk with a Celtic lean.
They have strong ties to the local com-
munity - the record release for their-
newest album, Finally Almost Ready, is
scheduled at the Blind Pig on Sept. 25.
"There's a very wide spectrum of
bands here, and you can really see it
at an event like Sonic Lunch," Zindle
explained. The event paired The Rag-
I. '.

birds with acts like experimental rock-
ers The Macpodz, which made for an
eclectic mix of local music from all
tastes and persuasions over the course
of the summer.
The Ragbirds have been playing at
the event since it began, and have seen
the stylistic breadth of the performers,
as well as their own audience, grow
steadily each time.
"Sometimes as much as a couple hun-
dred people will show up," she contin-
ued. "People bring lawn chairs, and kids
are always dancing around the park. Of
course, I'm sure having free food helps,
too."
Local restaurants and food chains
were involved with Sonic Lunch in a
major way, offering giveaways, T-shirts
and gift certificates each week. Pass-
ers-by were often just as enticed by the
music, which was audible from blocks
away, as they were by the food. Magnet-
ic emcee and local DJ Martin Bandyke,
was also part of the mix.
Bandyke is most commonly recog-
nized as the morningDJ on Ann Arbor's
107one and for his weekly eclectic music
program Fine Tunings. It's his wealth
of music knowledge and genuine inter-
est in the local scene, however, that
make him endearing to so many. Sonic
Lunch employed his charisma and deep
roots in the local scene to introduce this
year's performances, adding further
color to an event already ringing with
local flair.
Bandyke also had a central role in
choosing this summer's lineup, a task
few in the area are more qualified to do.
His fostering of bands like The Ragbirds
and The Macpodz from early on in their
careers made them easy picks for the
event, showing just how close-knit and
supportive the Ann Arbor musical com-
munity can be.
Kari Fedewa, the marketing offi-
cer for the Bank of Ann Arbor and the
event's title sponsor explained just how
crucial Bandyke's role was in creating
a comfortable atmosphere for both the
audience and performers.
"He's kind of a local legend around
here, between the radio and his involve-
ment with local music," she said. "We
were lucky to have him this year."
Fedewa and other event organizers
made a big push with social network-
ing for this summer's series, offering
updates through Facebook, MySpace
and Twitter. She was glad to see audi-

ences increase as a result.
"I was surprised that people some-
times drove an hour or two to come this
year," she said. "The social network-
ing sites made a huge difference. We're
always learning how to best get the
word out to everybody."
Plagued by rain over the course of
the summer, several events had to be
rescheduled, pushing the series into
September. Michigan folk troubadour
Jill Jack was the last artist to play, clos-
ing out the series on Sept. 10. Despite
the rain, this summer's series was
markedly more attended than in previ-
ous years.
"The attendance was up, particularly
in the beginning," Fedewa explained. "A
rain-out in the second week maybe hurt
momentum a little bit, but audiences
were still pretty strong throughout the
summer."
While social networking and radio
plugs certainly spearheaded the mar-
keting campaigns for the event, getting
the word out on the street was just as
much of a focus for Sonic Lunch's orga-
nizers. With ad posters taped to tele-
phone poles and coffee shop bulletin
boards throughout the city as well as
local sidewalk chalk artists stenciling
"Sonic Lunch" logos up and down Lib-
erty, Sonic Lunch is certainly aiming to
make its presence known.
Fedewa foresees the event grow-
ing even more in the future, and next
summer she aims to attract even big-
ger names and audiences. This time
around, the social networking sites are
still being used to gather feedback from
Lunch-goers this past summer, and the
sites are open to taking suggestions for
next summer's performers.
When asked if Sonic Lunch is at a
disadvantage because its smaller venue
can't cater to more high-profile artists
and an increasing audience, Fedewa
didn't seem too concerned. After a
summer of great music, great food and
enthusiastic audiences, she shouldn't
be.
"Its central spot between State and
Main is really an ideal location," she
said. "I think we're going to be staying
here for a while."
And hopefully they will be. The Sonic
Lunch series was an unquestionable
success this summer, and those in Ann
Arbor in the summer of 2010 should
have an even juicier series to look for-
ward to.

J fyParis Hilton's quest for her BFF isn't
satisfying your craving for celebrity-
centered "reality" tube trash, don't
fret. There's a whole
lot more where that
came from. Jessica

singer - is reportedly L

yet another vapid real-
ity vehicle.
The show, tentatively titled "The Price
of Beauty," will air on VH and will follow
Simpson as she explores the world to gain
a deeper understanding of what beauty
means across different cultures. It's a cute
idea, especially consideringthe fact that
Simpson has recently been trashed by the
tabloids for her supposed weight gain.
Hopefully the renowned ditz will wow her
audience with a new slew of catch phrases
philosophizing on the origins of canned
tuna.
If JSimp is a little too clean-cut for your
tastes, then you may be interested in the
show that famed Hollywood trainwreck
Lindsay Lohan is supposedly hawking.
UK's Mirror recently reported that LiLo
is approaching Britney Spears's manager
with hopes to sell the concept for a real-
ity TV show that will, in the words of the
source who leaked the item, "encapsulate
her trials and tribulations as she gets back
on her feet and actually becomes a work-
ing actress again." Good luck with that,
LiLo. Hopefully L.A.'s rehab centers have
lax camera crew restrictions after she
comes down with another case of extreme
"exhaustion."
Speaking of actresses everyone loves
to hate (or hates to love, depending on
personal preference), Megan Fox - the
famed Hollywood intellectual known for
such gems as "If you eat Chinese food,
your farts come out like Chinese food. If
you eat Mexican food, your farts come
out like Mexican food," - is back spewing
vapid word-vomit across glossy maga-
zines. Now that she's successfully proven
her "talents" as a demonic high school sex
vixen in Diablo Cody's upcoming "Jenni-
fer's Body" - as opposed to her standard
role as mere non-demonic high school
sex vixen - Fox thinks it's time to shit all
over director Michael Bay and his "Trans-
formers" empire, which helped place the
silicone siren on the nation's radar in the
first place.
In a recent interview, Fox referred to
Bay as "Hitler," and went on to ridicule
the director by saying that when "he's not
in director mode, I kind of really enjoy
his personality because he's so awkward,
so hopelessly awkward. He has no social
skills at all." First of all, LOL. It makes far
too much sense that the creator of such
epic blockbusters as "Pearl Harbor" and
"Armageddon" would have next to no
social skills.
In response to Fox's hilarious allega-
tions, a group of three "Transformers"
crew members - who, let's admit it, were
probably comprised of Bay himself, along
with a lowly production assistant or two
- published a public hate letter to Fox on
Bay's own website, thus igniting a classic
flame war between a big-mouthed Hol-
lywood bimbo and a nerd squad of film
techies.
Say what you will about Fox's propen-
sity for feedingridiculous quotes to the
press and her self-conscious attempts
to mold herself into America's Next Big
Sex Symbol, but she never ceases to bea

delightful spectacle. It isn't hard tocome
out on top when you're up against the
nerdy director of big-budget, no-brain
summer fanfare.
Speaking of pointless-yet-entertaining
online disputes, Twitter is slowlyturn-
ing into celebritards' primary haunt for
airing their personal grievances. Who
cares whether or not Twitter is actually
relevant? Celebrities are just happy there
is finally a platform that accommodates
their narcissism by allowing them to proj-
ect well-crafted beads of wisdom into 140
characters or less.
The latest high-profile bitch fight
comes courtesy of the much-hated King
of Celebrity Trash Talk Perez Hilton, who
managed to royally piss off Demi Moore
by linking to photos via Twitter of Moore's
15-year-old daughter Tallulah Willis
wearing a revealing top while out party-
ing. Hilton accused Moore of being an
inept mother, while Moore tweeted back
accusing Hilton of hawking child porn.
Regardless of who came out looking better
in the skirmish (because there truly are no
winners in a Twitter tussle), one thing is
clear: We have entered a brave new world
of celebrity ego battles. Prepare for this to
become a regular occurrence.
Of course, anysynopsis of the world
of celebrity pseudo-drama would be
incomplete without a proper salute to the
King of Pop himself, Michael Jackson. In
the days and weeks following Jackson's
early demise, an awful lot of ugliness has
emerged about Jackson's personal demons
and his family's non-existent integrity.

stroking his overly engorged ego by steal-
ing the mic from teenage country singer
Taylor Swift as she accepted her award for
Best Female Video, West proceeded to blog
a booze-tinged half-assed apology.

The arrangements onReckoning,
as with nearly all R.E.M. record-
ings in the '80s, are kept pretty
spare - often there is nothing
more than vocals, a guitar or two,
drums, bass, the occasional piano
or mandolin and some percussion
here or there. The musical texture
of the band rests squarely in Peter
Buck's Rickenbacker guitar, which
echoes everything from The Byrds
to Big Star to Gang of Four - all of
whom he has cited as among the
band's primary influences.
Apart from the songwriting,
it's the goofy nods and youthful
segues - the funky hidden track
between "Camera" and "(Don't
Go Back to) Rockville" is more
akin to their contemporaries The

Replacements - that push Reck-
oning above the rest of the band's
catalogue. I'd like to think Stipe's
spelling of "r-e-a-c-t" in the last
verse of "Harborcoat" is an hom-
age to Patti Smith (via "Gloria") -
he was, after all, a huge fan of her
Horses.
Reckoning makes it easy to for-
get how hard it is to make lasting
pop songs that aren't pinned down
by sappy lyrics or overproduction.
The genius of R.E.M. comes from
taking a bright hook, be it instru-
mental or vocal, and winding it
through darkly emotive lyrics
and haunting melodies. Reckon-
ing shows a legendary band in its
prime, and if it's not enough to
make you a believer, goddamn
your confusion.
