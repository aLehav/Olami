A 

University 
of 
Michigan 

student reported 
being 
sexually 

assaulted by her 

Graduate Student Instructor 
this summer in June. She 
filed the report, met with a 
U-M Title IX investigator and 
submitted evidence to back 
up her claim months ago. But 
the University’s investigation 
of the student’s case has 
been ongoing for almost four 
months now — and she’s 
running 
out 
of 
patience.

The 
School 
of 
Music, 

Theatre & Dance senior — 
who will be referred to as 
Taylor in this article — said 
her relationship with her 
GSI began in the middle 
of 
her 
junior 
year. 
The 

GSI is a doctoral student 
studying conducting under 
Prof. 
Michael 
Haithcock. 

He 
teaches 
band 
classes 

and 
is 
a 
GSI 
for 
the 

Michigan 
Marching 
Band.

For 
a 
while, 
the 

relationship was consensual. 
But the student said her 
GSI 
became 
increasingly 

aggressive 
during 
their 

time together. At the end of 
their relationship, she said, 
he sexually assaulted her.

That GSI did not respond 

to an email request 
for an interview.

After 
reporting 

the 
incident 
to 

the 
Office 
of 

Institutional 
Equity 
this 

summer, 
Taylor 

says she feels like 
her mental health 
and 
professional 

future is not being 
considered 
by 

the 
University.

Much 
has 
been 

said about biases in 
the University’s sexual 
misconduct 
reporting 

process 
against 
accused 

students. 
An 
investigation 

of this student’s case by The 
Michigan 
Daily 
reaffirms 

the tired runaround students 
and faculty still face when to 
comes to reporting concerns 
to their safety and well-being.

***
Taylor’s story begins this 

February when she added 
her GSI on Facebook. He 
was her GSI for concert 
band 
and 
immediately 

started 
messaging 
her.

Taylor 
didn’t 
think 

anything of the conversation 
at first, as close relationships 
between 
faculty 
and 

students 
in 
SMTD 
are 

common 
between 
long 

hours practicing, traveling 
together and a smaller, tight-
knit academic community.

The GSI first made physical 

contact with Taylor on an 

SMTD 
band 
trip, 
touching 
Taylor’s 
legs 

and kissing her 
multiple 
times 

— 
without 
her 

consent. 
Afterward, 

she messaged him expressing 
she felt his conduct was 
inappropriate. 
The 
Daily 

reviewed screenshots of these 
texts provided by Taylor. 
They then didn’t talk until 
after spring break. Though 
he was still her conductor, 
Taylor 
said 
he 
seemed 

to 
purposely 
avoid 
her.

But then he approached 

her again, informing her that 
he registered a relationship 

with her. 

Faculty 

members 

and 
teaching 

staff 
to 
are 

required to register 

relationships with students, 
but The Daily was not able to 
confirm the GSI filed such a 
record due to privacy laws.

So 
they 
began 
dating. 

Despite 
some 
of 
his 

unsettling practices, Taylor 
was flattered. The GSI was, 
after all, extremely well-liked 
among students and faculty.

“I was like, oh my god, like 

he’s paying attention to me 
and he’s like, everyone loves 

him,” 
she 
said. 

“So I was like, 
wow, I must be 
really 
special.”

He 
did 
not 

acknowledge her 
in public, she said, 
and the two did 
not go on dates. 
Texts detail few 
people knew about 
their 
contact.

The GSI: Nope!! 

I 
had 
many 

problems like that.
I 
worked 
in 
4 

different places so far 

and in the beginning 

something 
like 
that 

always happened. But now 
I know and I can avoid it.

Let’s 
be 
careful

At 
school 
we 
just 

say 
“hi” 
for 
a 
while.

Taylor: Yes I know we 

should be careful. I don’t 
have 
to 
talk 
to 
you 
at 

school at all not even hi.

Taylor 
mentioned 
she 

heard from other students 
the GSI had been accused 
of harassment at previous 
schools. 
The 
Daily 
filed 

a 
federal 
information 

request to the University 
of 
Minnesota-Duluth, 
the 

institution 
he 
worked 
at 

immediately prior to coming 
to Michigan, but there were 
no 
Title 
IX 
complaints 

with 
his 
name 
on 
it.

Taylor said after those 

text messages, he started 
becoming 
aggressive. 
He 

began to accuse Taylor of 
cheating on him, which she 
denies. In the texts shared 
with The Daily, he repeatedly 
accused her of going to bars 
and having sex with other 
men, and that it was a well-
known fact in the music 
community. 
Throughout 

the texts, Taylor protested 
his accusations, which he 
glossed 
over 
every 
time.

He 
replied: 
“Learn 
a 

lesson...you 
can 
regret 

about things you’ve done 
but the past is always part 
of 
what 
you 
are 
today.”

“Sometimes I still question, 

like, did (the harassment 
and assault) really happen?” 
she said. “Because I, for 
most of the relationship, did 
anything he wanted. I did 
whatever, just to make him 
like me because I thought 
he was like an important 
person in the music world — 
and making connections and 
networking is so important.’”

She went to pick him up 

from the airport on June 
4. When they went back 
to her place, Taylor said, 
he sexually assaulted her.

She was bleeding heavily 

afterward, 
and 
continued 

to bleed for days after the 
encounter. She texted a friend 
in a panic. She went to an 
OB-GYN, who later confirmed 
to The Daily Taylor visited his 
office and reported the assault.

The International Youth and 

Students for Social Equality 
hosted David North, national 
chairman 
of 
the 
Socialist 

Equality Party, Tuesday evening 
for a lecture on the global history 

of socialism, discussing what he 
perceived to be the corruption 
of the ideology’s true intent 
on the left and the need for a 
worldwide socialist revolution. 
An audience of approximately 50 
University of Michigan students 
and members of the Ann Arbor 
community gathered in Angell 
Hall to listen to North and Niles 

Niemuth, the Socialist Equality 
Party’s candidate for Congress in 
Michigan’s 12th District.

North 
is 
currently 
on 
a 

speaking tour celebrating the 
80th anniversary of the founding 
of the socialist organization 
“Fourth International” by Soviet 
revolutionary Leon Trotsky.

In his lecture, North urged 

a better historical awareness 
among students to contextualize 
contemporary events taking place 
in the world and allow for a better 
understanding 
of 
socialism, 

which he argued has been 
corrupted by the modern left.

David North, Chairman of the Socialist

North spoke to a crowd of 50 students, residents on ideology, progressive politics

The University of Michigan’s 

Office for Institutional Equity 
released a report on Monday 
regarding University responses 
to reports of sexual harassment 
pertaining to staff, faculty and 
third parties during the past year. 
The report was the first to include 
details of sexual misconduct 
among faculty; annual reports 
on sexual misconduct among 
students have been released 
since 2014. In future years, there 
will be a single report released by 
OIE yearly, including all sexual 
misconduct cases for students, 
faculty, staff and third parties.

“We share this information 

in order to be transparent, 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
these 

behaviors

A recent study conducted by 

University of Michigan Rackham 
student Shannon Ang has revealed 
that social media use among older 
adults can limit the effects of pain

Ang, the study’s lead author

Department of Sociology and 
Institute for Social Research, 
was 
curious 
of 
the 
long-

term 
consequences 
of 
online 

participation 
through 
social 

networking platforms. He was 
interested specifically in the elderly 
population because of the lack of 
studies related to the age group.

“I was interested in whether 

social media would be able to 
supplement the effects of people 
who are in pain or are physically 
limited,” Ang said.

“I can’t wait to get out of here,” Taylor said. “I don’t wear anything Michigan anymore. I don’t want to go to tailgates or 
go to football games. I don’t want to support this school. Like, I’m not afraid to say out loud that I hate U-M. I don’t care if 

U-M is this prestigious university … It feels unfortunate that I came here.”


In 
a 
statement 
released 

early Monday morning, the 
Senate Advisory Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs 
at 

the University of Michigan 
addressed 
the 
recent 

letter issued by LSA Interim 
Dean 
Elizabeth 
Cole 

regarding the retraction of 
a recommendation letter by 
Associate 
Professor 
John 

Cheney-Lippold. 
SACUA 

stressed the importance of 
“academic freedom and the 
rights and responsibilities of 
academic tenure.”

The statement comes after 

an earlier statement released 
Sept. 24 from SACUA, revealing 
their 
“disappointment” 

in a professor that would 
allow 
his 
personal 
beliefs 

to 
limit 
opportunity 
for 

University 
students. 
The 

earlier 
document 
echoes 

the statement produced by 
University President Schlissel 
and Provost Martin Philbert 
advocating for the creation 
of a panel that would attempt 
to find a balance between 
political 
ideology 
and 

professors’ 
commitment 
to 

their students, and ultimately 

placed 
emphasis 
on 
the 

notion that “faculty members’ 
personal 
political 
beliefs 

cannot interfere with their 
obligations to our students.”

However, 
the 
new 

proclamation 
specifically 

pertains to the letter by Cole 
which reveals the sanctions 
placed 
on 
Cheney-Lippold 

by the administration. These 
sanctions 
restrict 
Cheney-

Lippold from receiving a salary 
increase for one year and voids 
him of sabbatical credits for 
two years.

These penalties followed 

Cheney-Lippold’s refusal to 
pen a recommendation letter 
for LSA junior Abigail Ingber 
after learning her study abroad 
location was in Israel. Shortly 
after, 
Rackham 
student 

Lucy 
Peterson 
followed 

suit, refusing to deliver a letter 
for a student wishing to study 
in the same area.

Peterson 
wrote 
in 

an op-ed published by The 
Daily that her “action attests 
to (her) ongoing engagement 
with the theory and practice 
of social justice pedagogy 
as well as (her) concern for 
the 
injustices 
suffered 
by 

Palestinians.”

Shortly after, Cole addressed 

Cheney-Lippold 
directly 
in 

a letter published Oct. 3 and 
said future decisions to write 
a letter of recommendation 
should put students ahead of a 
political agenda.

“In the future, a student’s 

merit should be your primary 
guide for determining how and 
whether to provide a letter of 
recommendation,” Cole wrote. 
“You are not to use student 
requests for recommendations 
as a platform to discuss your 
personal political beliefs.”

In 
the 
new 
statement, 

SACUA said Cole’s response 
could 
possibly 
create 
“a 

chilling effect on members 
of the academic community 
who may, for legitimate and 
deeply held personal reasons, 
feel 
uncomfortable 
about 

providing letters to certain 
organizations or individuals.”

SACUA cited its previous 

statement, 
declaring 
the 

assembly wished to affirm 
a 
“community 
standard,” 

and 
thus 
objects 
to 
the 

preceding letter being used 
as 
“endorsement” 
for 
the 

disciplines placed on Cheney-
Lippold.

Similarly, 
SACUA 

reasserted their commitment 
to the American Association 
of 
University 
Professors’ 

Statement 
on 
Professional 

Ethics, which, again, places 
a 
student’s 
merit 
as 
the 

dominant factor in assessing a 
student’s request for a letter of 
recommendation.

However, 
Hans-Joerg 

Tiede, 
associate 
secretary 

of 
the 
AAUP, 
has 
also 

recently 
addressed 
the 

penalties placed on Cheney-
Lippold. 
Tiede 
suggested 

the 
University 
reconsider 

their 
decision, 
claiming 

the 
sanctions 
“violate 
the 

association’s standards of due 
process.”

SACUA 
emphasized 

recommendation letters are 
“personal 
endorsements,” 

and the declining of this act 
should not cultivate a fear of 
retribution. Moreover, SACUA 
stressed in the case of a member 
of the University community 
being so afraid that they might 
feel coerced to administer a 
letter or recommendation, or 
advocate for opinions they 
do not truly hold, would then 
lead to “the integrity of the 
recommendation 
(being) 

tarnished and the academic 
freedom that is central to 
our 
University 
(becoming) 

impugned.”

University responds to sexual 
misconduct,” 
interim 
OIE 

head Jeffery Frumkin said in 
the report. “These behaviors 
have no place at Michigan, 

and 
we 
encourage 
every 

member of our community 
who has concerns about sexual 
misconduct to reach out.”

Frumkin has taken up the 

role as Title IX Coordinator 
after Pamela Heatlie stepped 
down last week. Frumkin also 
will serve as the associate 

vice 
provost 
for 
academic 

and faculty affairs and senior 
director 
for 
institutional 

equity for OIE. According to 
the University, efforts to find 
a permanent replacement for 
head of OIE will begin soon.

Counting reports made from 

July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, 

OIE received 235 reports 
of 
sexual 
misconduct 

made by faculty and staff. 
232 of these reports were 
addressed by OIE, while the 
other three were addressed 
by 
Human 
Resources 

under applicable collective 
bargaining 
agreements. 

Approximately 90 reports 
were addressed by OIE 
during the previous year, 
indicating a 161 percent 
increase 
in 
reports 

received this year.

The 
majority 
of 

reports — 53 percent — 
were addressed with a 
consultation, while only 
11 percent of reports made 
resulted in an investigation.

According to the report, 

consultations are defined 
as “questions or reports 
that 
can 
be 
addressed 

appropriately 
without 
a 

review or investigation.” 
Of the 18 investigations 
completed at the time of 
the report’s release, seven 
investigations 
found 
no 

policy violation, five found 
inappropriate 
behavior 

(but not severe enough to 
be considered hostile) and 
seven were found to be policy 
violations.

Of the 10 corrective actions 

made by OIE as a result of these 
investigations, three instances 
resulted 
in 
termination 
of 

employment. In five instances 
in which OIE found a policy 
violation 
or 
inappropriate 

behavior, 
the 
respondent 

resigned. In two of these 
instances, 
the 
resignation 

occurred before the end of 
the investigation or before 
corrective action was enacted. 
In cases where the employee 
resigned, 
the 
employee 
is 

often not eligible for future 
University 
employment, 

according to the report.

During the past reporting 

year, OIE received 277 reports 
of sexual misconduct made 
by students, also seeing an 
increase in reports from the 
previous year Of these reports, 
the majority of issues reported 
were related to sexual assault 
or 
sexual 
harassment, 

representing 49 percent and 
28 percent of issues reported, 
respectively. 
Of 
reports 

made by students, only seven 
percent, or 20 cases, resulted 
in an investigation.

SACUA releases new statement in support 
of “academic freedom,” in rec. letter case

SAM SMALL

Daily Staff Reporter


She attempted to pass it 

off as a menstrual period 
to her GSI and her family. 
However, Taylor does not get 
her periods regularly and the 
bleeding became the biggest 
red flag of a potentially violent 
experience 
to 
her 
mother. 

Taylor’s mother then reported 
the incident to the University.

Now, 
it’s 
October. 

Taylor’s 
evidence 
is 
in, 

and 
her 
statements 
have 

been collected. But she still 
doesn’t have a verdict in her 
case. And she has no idea 
when she might receive one.

***
According 
to 
the 

University’s 
student 
sexual 

misconduct 
policy, 
here’s 

what should have happened 
when Taylor’s mother first 
reported 
the 
incident 
to 

the 
Office 
of 
Institutional 

Equity 
on 
June 
20, 
2018:

Once a situation is reported 

to OIE, the Title IX coordinator 
makes an initial assessment 
of the report and ensures the 
claimant receives a written 
explanation of resources and 
options 
available 
to 
them.

After the initial assessment, 

a 
coordinator 
will 
decide 

whether to investigate the 
case, 
and 
move 
toward 
a 

formal resolution, or whether 
to move directly into finding 
alternative 
resolutions 
and 

additional 
remedies. 
The 

claimant’s wishes, the evidence 
and the code of conduct all 
play a part in the decision.

If 
the 
coordinator 

decides the case should be 
investigated, they’ll assign an 
investigator, usually a member 
of the Title IX staff, to the file. 
The investigator meets with 
the claimant, the respondent 
(the alleged abuser) and any 
relevant witnesses on separate 
occasions 
to 
offer 
them 

the opportunity to present 
information 
and 
evidence. 

During these meetings, the 
policy 
dictates 
both 
the 

claimant and the respondent 
can have an “adviser” of their 
choice — that’s code for a lawyer.

According to the policy, the 

University tries to complete 
every investigation within 60 
days, though it acknowledges 

extenuating 
circumstances 

might lengthen the timeline. 
Regardless of the length, the 
policy stipulates both parties 
will 
be 
updated 
regularly.

After 
the 
interviews 

have 
been 
conducted 
and 

the 
evidence 
collected, 

the investigator will write 
what’s called a “preliminary 
investigation 
report” 
that 

includes 
all 
the 
known 

information. 
Both 
parties 

can 
review 
the 
draft 

report, and they have five 
days 
to 
submit 
comments.

But 
in 
practice, 
the 

process isn’t so regimented.

After 
Taylor’s 
mother 

called OIE, the investigation 
officially commenced on June 
20. Taylor said she immediately 
requested a no-contact order, 
which 
meant 
neither 
she 

nor her GSI could initiate 
any 
kind 
of 
contact 
with 

each other — not in person, 
over text or on social media. 
 

As per the U-M policy, OIE 

senior 
investigator 
Daniel 

Ferency was assigned to be 
the investigator in the case. 
Taylor said Ferency reached 
out to her to ask if she wanted 
to give a statement. They 
exchanged emails to find a 
time to meet, and like the 
policy 
mandates, 
Ferency 

alerted 
Taylor 
to 
support 

resources on campus she could 
access if she wanted. He also 
said she had the right to bring 
a lawyer or any other support 
person 
to 
their 
meeting.

When she got to the meeting, 

though, Taylor was caught 
off-guard. A note-taker was 
present at the meeting, taking 
down her comments while 
Ferency questioned her on her 
experience. She said she wasn’t 
given any warning there would 
be a stranger in the room.

Shortly after the meeting 

with Ferency, she left for a 
summer study abroad trip. 
It was taking a while for 
her medical records to be 
submitted 
to 
Ferency 
as 

evidence, and she emailed him 
about it on June 27 to remind 
him she was still working 
on 
getting 
them 
to 
him.

“You should look out for your 

statement 
either 
tomorrow 

or Friday,” he replied to her 
via 
email 
that 
same 
day.

However, Taylor didn’t hear 

anything else from Ferency 
until July 16 — over three weeks 

after he said he would pass 
along her statement for review.

“When we met on June 19, 

2018, I mentioned that the 
next step in the OIE process 
would be for me to send you 
a summary of your interview 
statement for your review,” 
Ferency wrote in his email. 
“A copy of the summary is 
attached. As we discussed, you 
are not required to review this 
summary. If you choose to 
review it, it can be helpful to 
have a support person present 
… If you decide to review 
this summary, the deadline 
to provide any comments or 
suggestions you may have is 
July 18, 2018. If I don’t hear 
from you by July 18, 2018, I 
will assume you approve of the 
statement as drafted, and will 
move forward with the review.”

During 
this 
process, 

Taylor 
was 
out 
of 
the 

country, 
in 
another 
time 

zone, 
without 
anyone 

who could be an effective 
“support 
person” 
for 
her.

Taylor said she found 15 

mistakes in the report and 
sent her corrections to the 
investigator. 
Eventually, 

Ferency did grant her extra 
time 
to 
make 
corrections, 

and 
she 
turned 
in 
her 

revised copy of the statement 
as soon as she was able.

The next time she heard 

from Ferency was at the end 
of August, just after the 
60-day mark, when she shared 
him on a Google document 
containing screenshots of her 
text messages with her GSI.

Shortly after, the school 

year started. Taylor, who is 
studying music performance, 
had to audition for different 
ensemble classes. One of them 
is a required two-credit class. 
To her horror, she was placed 
in the same GSI’s band class.

After a back and forth with 

OIE and SMTD administrators, 
it 
was 
determined 
Taylor 

could get a waiver for the 
performance 
class, 
which 

meant 
she 
wouldn’t 
need 

to 
fulfill 
that 
graduation 

requirement. 
She 
said 
it 

was a devastating solution.

“That’s six hours a week of 

rehearsal,” she added. “That’s 
four or five concerts in a 
semester. That’s opportunity 
to perform your pieces, work 
with current composers, to 
go play other schools. I’m 

losing all of that while he gets 
to keep that and they don’t 
see anything wrong with it. 
(This is) my only option.”

According to Taylor, there 

are other orchestras or bands 
that need extra players, but she 
hasn’t been asked to participate.

“Instead of asking me, they’re 

asking other students that are 
also not in orchestra but I don’t 
know why they’re not asking 
me because I have nothing,” 
she 
said. 
“Those 
students 

are in band or something ... 
The guy who is head of bands 
here is, like, best friends with 
him and he has made it very 
clear that he does not like me 
and does not support me.”

The director of bands is 

Music prof. Michael Haithcock 
— the GSI’s direct supervisor. 
The Daily reached out to 
Haithcock 
for 
a 
comment. 

He declined to comment via 
email, and said he hoped the 
GSI would sue The Daily 
“if he is found innocent.” 

***
The waiver meant Taylor and 

her GSI would no longer have 
to be in the same classroom. 
But she still had other classes 
in the music school, so she ran 
into him around the building.

She recalled changing her 

shoes in her car one morning 
before class. While she was 
sitting in the car, he pulled up 
right next to her and sat there 
staring for long enough that 
Taylor became uncomfortable.

“I was pretty freaked out 

so I called [SMTD Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion officer 
Freyja Harris] … she found 
me in my car and she actually 
walked me all the way to a 
practice room,” Taylor said.

She 
also 
had 
a 
piano 

class 
in 
the 
basement 
of 

the music school, and said 
the GSI would sit outside 
her 
class 
for 
two 
weeks.

“I 
told 
(SMTD) 
Dean 

(Mark) Clague and I know 
that 
Dean 
Clague 
had 
to 

say something to him more 
than 
once,” 
Taylor 
said. 

“But eventually he stopped.”

Throughout 
these 

experiences at the beginning 
of this school year, she was 
not in regular communication 
with 
Ferency 
or 
anyone 

from OIE. She and Ferency 
exchanged emails on Sept. 5, 
and he gave her directions on 
how to enable her lawyer to 

release medical forms on her 
behalf. But Taylor still had a 
lot of questions about how her 
case was being handled, and no 
one was offering her answers.

She finally turned to SMTD 

administrators and informed 
them of the situation. They were 
upset to find OIE had given 
administrators essentially zero 
information on the situation 
going into the school year.

Taylor said once she and 

her mom got Clague up to 
speed, they found him to be 
very 
helpful. 
However, 
he 

could only do so much, and 
by mid-September, the lack of 
communication and the drawn-
out process finally prompted 
her to request a different 
investigator. On September 18, 
Ferency emailed the student 
to let her know her case had 
been transferred to another 
OIE 
senior 
investigator, 

Suzanne 
Quinn 
McFadden. 

The 
student 
was 
hopeful 

that things would speed up. 
Instead, it was more of the 
same. She didn’t hear anything 
from McFadden until Oct. 5.

“I am writing to let you 

know that I am now working 
on your investigation with 
OIE as your case was recently 
transferred to me,” McFadden 
wrote in an email on Oct. 5. 
“I just wanted to check-in 
with you and offer an update. 
I am currently drafting the 
preliminary 
report 
which 

will be sent to you shortly.”

There was no follow-up to 

let the student know what, 
exactly, 
McFadden 
meant 

by “shortly.” At the time of 
publication of this article, the 
student still has not received 
the 
preliminary 
report.

“I don’t know. It’s been a 

while and I just haven’t seen 
it,” she said. “I haven’t even 
seen 
his 
statement, 
which 

like, it started in June — we 
should 
at 
least 
have 
each 

other’s statements by now.”

On Oct. 12, Elizabeth Seney, 

deputy Title IX Coordinator 
for 
Investigations, 
emailed 

the student to tell her the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Sixth Circuit’s recent decision, 
which determined that public 
universities have to give accused 
students the opportunity to 
cross-examine 
the 
accuser 

and witnesses at an in-person 
hearing, will apply to her case.

According 
to 
an 
email 

interview 
with 
Jeffery 

Frumkin, 
the 
newinterim 

Title 
IX 
coordinator 
and 

senior director of OIE, the 
University is still developing 
the process for these hearings. 
But this likely means this 
particular investigation will 
continue to be drawn out.

Taylor is wary of what 

this process will look like.

“I don’t trust any process 

coming from this school,” she 
said. “I don’t want to do ‘the 
cross-examination.’ But I also 
don’t want him to get away free.”

SMTD is also becoming a 

hostile environment for Taylor. 
She said one of her professors 
dismissed her sexual assault 
claims during class when she 
was absent during the first 
few weeks of the fall semester. 
She 
also 
said 
Haithcock 

blocked 
her 
on 
Facebook.

But 
she 
did 
have 
some 

positive 
interactions 
with 

faculty. She confided in her 
private music teacher about 
her situation and also felt 
like she had strong contact 
with Clague. Clague referred 
The Daily to Public Affairs 
when reached for comment.

She is sometimes escorted 

from her car and to classes 
by Harris, SMTD Diversity, 
Equity 
and 
Inclusion 

officer, who Taylor said was 
also 
a 
comforting 
figure 

in 
the 
administration. 
 

Harris is unable to comment 

on specific investigations due 
to FERPA rules. She explained 
to The Daily, however, that 
while 
her 
role 
rapidly 
is 

becoming a support system for 
SMTD students and faculty, 
she needs to remind them that 
she is not always the point 
person to go to because she 
does not investigate claims.

“In order to be able to 

support someone in my ongoing 
role, I need to let them know 
who is the right person to share 
to,” she said. “I don’t want to 
muddy the water — I want to 
support them. So, it’s what I 
tell them up front — you can 
tell me anything but I am not 
going to be the one to take you 
to the rest of the process. It 
depends on the situation. I am 
trying not to create issues (for 
the students) in their process.”

facing many students today is they 
seem to orient themselves in the 
absence of adequate historical 
knowledge,” North said.

The culprits of this lack of 

knowledge 
among 
youth, 
in 

North’s view, are the educational 
institutions in which they are 
taught.

“There is an utterly reactionary 

climate that prevails in many of 
the humanities departments of 
many universities, such as the 
University of Michigan,” North 
said. “The prevailing philosophy is 
postmodernism, which … is culled 
from the basement of bourgeois 
thought. It is the most backward, 
reactionary 
and 
dishonest 
of 

all approaches to the study or 
consideration of the past.”

North 
also 
criticized 

the affirmative action policies 
of many universities, which he 
portrayed as “quota systems.” 
He said the systems facilitate 
competition among students and 
divide society while competing for 
access to higher education. The 
Supreme Court upheld the state 
of Michigan’s ban on affirmative 
action policies in 2014, claiming the 
U.S. Constitution does not give the 
judicial branch the power to decide 
whether race can be used as a fact 
in the admissions process without 
voter input.

“Students are forced to compete 

for a limited number of positions, 
with applications asking for race 
and ethnicity … We know that 
quota systems are being set up,” 
North said. “There is no way a 
quota system can ever be fair.”

North posited these campus 

issues have much to do with the 
economic standing of professors. 
He said these wages for professors 
make the educators unable to 
understand 
the 
problems 
of 

students.

“If you’re a tenured professor … 

your wealth is in the top 10 percent 

and probably closer to the top 5 
percent,” North said.

As a response, North encouraged 

students to challenge this status 
quo both at the University and 
nationwide by engaging with 
socialist theory.

“I think as young people 

are drawn into social struggle 
they will come to recognize 
the incompatibility of what is 
presented 
on 
campuses 
from 

genuine revolutionary scientific 
theory,” North said.

North’s 
criticisms 
also 

targeted 
organizations 
such 

as 
the 
Democratic 
Socialists 

of America and contemporary 
figures on the American left, 
including Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., and congressional candidate 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He said 
his criticisms stemmed from their 
insufficient opposition to American 
foreign policy, as well as their focus 
on identity politics.

“A 
socialist 
who 
preaches 

national 
defense 
is 
a 
petty 

bourgeois reactionary at the service 
of the king capitalism,” North said. 
“When Bernie Sanders goes around 
defending America (and) praising 
Trump for defending America’s 
borders, he exposes himself as 
a petty bourgeois charlatan and 
reactionary.”

North decried the inadequacy 

of 
today’s 
leftist 
parties 
in 

promoting a worldwide socialist 
revolution, claiming the parties 
veer from campaign promises 
once elected.

LSA freshman Noah Streng 

said he found the event interesting 
and said engaging with socialist 
theory has changed his worldview 
since arriving at the University.

“I wish more people would 

have come out to come see it,” 
Streng said. “I started … learning 
about socialism a lot more since 
I got to college, and it’s really 
changed my perspective on the 
world pretty much upside down.”

Ang’s colleague on the study, 

Tuo-Yen 
Chen 
of 
Nanyang 

Technological 
University 
in 

Singapore, was also interested 
in how social media could alter 
pain’s role in depression.

“Social media has not been 

considered 
as 
a 
potential 

intervention 
strategy,” 
Chen 

said. “So, Shannon and I were 
wondering 
whether 
utilizing 

social 
media 
could 
lessen 

depression 
among 
individuals 

with pain.”

With 
the 
onset 
of 
such 

discomfort 
among 
elderly 

individuals, 
social 
interactions 

outside of the household naturally 
become limited. Ang and Chen 
sought to study how those affected 
could potentially be influenced by 
virtual interaction through social 
media.

Before the study, Ang and Chen 

hypothesized that social media 
usage would be helpful in relieving 
depression amid pain and that 
people might already be using 
social media to supplement their 
own social networking.

The 
basis 
of 
Ang 
and 

Chen’s research emerged from 

the National Health and Aging 
Trends Study, a publicly available 
data set that gathers information 
from more than 8,000 senior 
citizen Medicare beneficiaries.

“The purpose of NHATS is to 

foster research to guide efforts to 
reduce disability, maximize health 
and independent functioning and 
enhance quality of life at older 
ages,” Vicki Freedman, a research 
professor 
at 
the 
University’s 

Institute for Social Research’s 
Survey 
Research 
Center 
and 

a 
co-principal 
investigator 
of 

NHATS, said.

The survey asks its participants 

general questions on if they 

are 
experiencing 
feelings 
of 

depression, pain or have trouble 
falling asleep. In addition to queries 
on depressive symptoms, NHATS 
also inquires about senior citizens’ 
online activities.

For the purpose of their study, 

Ang and Chen focused mainly on 
the responses to the single question 
of if respondents had used a social 
media site in the past month. 
According to the survey, 17 percent 
of respondents had used a social 
networking platform in the past 
month.

SOCIALISM
From Page 1


In 
a 
statement 
released 

early Monday morning, the 
Senate Advisory Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs 
at 

the University of Michigan 
addressed 
the 
recent 

letter issued by LSA Interim 
Dean 
Elizabeth 
Cole 

regarding the retraction of 
a recommendation letter by 
Associate 
Professor 
John 

Cheney-Lippold. 
SACUA 

stressed the importance of 
“academic freedom and the 
rights and responsibilities of 
academic tenure.”

The statement comes after 

an earlier statement released 
Sept. 24 from SACUA, revealing 
their 
“disappointment” 

in a professor that would 
allow 
his 
personal 
beliefs 

to 
limit 
opportunity 
for 

University 
students. 
The 

earlier 
document 
echoes 

the statement produced by 
University President Schlissel 
and Provost Martin Philbert 
advocating for the creation 
of a panel that would attempt 
to find a balance between 
political 
ideology 
and 

professors’ 
commitment 
to 

their students, and ultimately 

placed 
emphasis 
on 
the 

notion that “faculty members’ 
personal 
political 
beliefs 

cannot interfere with their 
obligations to our students.”

However, 
the 
new 

proclamation 
specifically 

pertains to the letter by Cole 
which reveals the sanctions 
placed 
on 
Cheney-Lippold 

by the administration. These 
sanctions 
restrict 
Cheney-

Lippold from receiving a salary 
increase for one year and voids 
him of sabbatical credits for 
two years.

These penalties followed 

Cheney-Lippold’s refusal to 
pen a recommendation letter 
for LSA junior Abigail Ingber 
after learning her study abroad 
location was in Israel. Shortly 
after, 
Rackham 
student 

Lucy 
Peterson 
followed 

suit, refusing to deliver a letter 
for a student wishing to study 
in the same area.

Peterson 
wrote 
in 

an op-ed published by The 
Daily that her “action attests 
to (her) ongoing engagement 
with the theory and practice 
of social justice pedagogy 
as well as (her) concern for 
the 
injustices 
suffered 
by 

Palestinians.”

Shortly after, Cole addressed 

Cheney-Lippold 
directly 
in 

a letter published Oct. 3 and 
said future decisions to write 
a letter of recommendation 
should put students ahead of a 
political agenda.

“In the future, a student’s 

merit should be your primary 
guide for determining how and 
whether to provide a letter of 
recommendation,” Cole wrote. 
“You are not to use student 
requests for recommendations 
as a platform to discuss your 
personal political beliefs.”

In 
the 
new 
statement, 

SACUA said Cole’s response 
could 
possibly 
create 
“a 

chilling effect on members 
of the academic community 
who may, for legitimate and 
deeply held personal reasons, 
feel 
uncomfortable 
about 

providing letters to certain 
organizations or individuals.”

SACUA cited its previous 

statement, 
declaring 
the 

assembly wished to affirm 
a 
“community 
standard,” 

and 
thus 
objects 
to 
the 

preceding letter being used 
as 
“endorsement” 
for 
the 

disciplines placed on Cheney-
Lippold.

Similarly, 
SACUA 

reasserted their commitment 
to the American Association 
of 
University 
Professors’ 

Statement 
on 
Professional 

Ethics, which, again, places 
a 
student’s 
merit 
as 
the 

dominant factor in assessing a 
student’s request for a letter of 
recommendation.

However, 
Hans-Joerg 

Tiede, 
associate 
secretary 

of 
the 
AAUP, 
has 
also 

recently 
addressed 
the 

penalties placed on Cheney-
Lippold. 
Tiede 
suggested 

the 
University 
reconsider 

their 
decision, 
claiming 

the 
sanctions 
“violate 
the 

association’s standards of due 
process.”

SACUA 
emphasized 

recommendation letters are 
“personal 
endorsements,” 

and the declining of this act 
should not cultivate a fear of 
retribution. Moreover, SACUA 
stressed in the case of a member 
of the University community 
being so afraid that they might 
feel coerced to administer a 
letter or recommendation, or 
advocate for opinions they 
do not truly hold, would then 
lead to “the integrity of the 
recommendation 
(being) 

tarnished and the academic 
freedom that is central to 
our 
University 
(becoming) 

impugned.”

University responds to sexual 
misconduct,” 
interim 
OIE 

head Jeffery Frumkin said in 
the report. “These behaviors 
have no place at Michigan, 

and 
we 
encourage 
every 

member of our community 
who has concerns about sexual 
misconduct to reach out.”

Frumkin has taken up the 

role as Title IX Coordinator 
after Pamela Heatlie stepped 
down last week. Frumkin also 
will serve as the associate 

vice 
provost 
for 
academic 

and faculty affairs and senior 
director 
for 
institutional 

equity for OIE. According to 
the University, efforts to find 
a permanent replacement for 
head of OIE will begin soon.

Counting reports made from 

July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, 

OIE received 235 reports 
of 
sexual 
misconduct 

made by faculty and staff. 
232 of these reports were 
addressed by OIE, while the 
other three were addressed 
by 
Human 
Resources 

under applicable collective 
bargaining 
agreements. 

Approximately 90 reports 
were addressed by OIE 
during the previous year, 
indicating a 161 percent 
increase 
in 
reports 

received this year.

The 
majority 
of 

reports — 53 percent — 
were addressed with a 
consultation, while only 
11 percent of reports made 
resulted in an investigation.

According to the report, 

consultations are defined 
as “questions or reports 
that 
can 
be 
addressed 

appropriately 
without 
a 

review or investigation.” 
Of the 18 investigations 
completed at the time of 
the report’s release, seven 
investigations 
found 
no 

policy violation, five found 
inappropriate 
behavior 

(but not severe enough to 
be considered hostile) and 
seven were found to be policy 
violations.

Of the 10 corrective actions 

made by OIE as a result of these 
investigations, three instances 
resulted 
in 
termination 
of 

employment. In five instances 
in which OIE found a policy 
violation 
or 
inappropriate 

behavior, 
the 
respondent 

resigned. In two of these 
instances, 
the 
resignation 

occurred before the end of 
the investigation or before 
corrective action was enacted. 
In cases where the employee 
resigned, 
the 
employee 
is 

often not eligible for future 
University 
employment, 

according to the report.

During the past reporting 

year, OIE received 277 reports 
of sexual misconduct made 
by students, also seeing an 
increase in reports from the 
previous year Of these reports, 
the majority of issues reported 
were related to sexual assault 
or 
sexual 
harassment, 

representing 49 percent and 
28 percent of issues reported, 
respectively. 
Of 
reports 

made by students, only seven 
percent, or 20 cases, resulted 
in an investigation.

Latest statement addresses letter by LSA Interim Dean Elizabeth Cole, sanctioning of professor 

SACUA releases new statement in support 
of “academic freedom,” in rec. letter case

SAM SMALL

Daily Staff Reporter


She attempted to pass it 

off as a menstrual period 
to her GSI and her family. 
However, Taylor does not get 
her periods regularly and the 
bleeding became the biggest 
red flag of a potentially violent 
experience 
to 
her 
mother. 

Taylor’s mother then reported 
the incident to the University.

Now, 
it’s 
October. 

Taylor’s 
evidence 
is 
in, 

and 
her 
statements 
have 

been collected. But she still 
doesn’t have a verdict in her 
case. And she has no idea 
when she might receive one.

***
According 
to 
the 

University’s 
student 
sexual 

misconduct 
policy, 
here’s 

what should have happened 
when Taylor’s mother first 
reported 
the 
incident 
to 

the 
Office 
of 
Institutional 

Equity 
on 
June 
20, 
2018:

Once a situation is reported 

to OIE, the Title IX coordinator 
makes an initial assessment 
of the report and ensures the 
claimant receives a written 
explanation of resources and 
options 
available 
to 
them.

After the initial assessment, 

a 
coordinator 
will 
decide 

whether to investigate the 
case, 
and 
move 
toward 
a 

formal resolution, or whether 
to move directly into finding 
alternative 
resolutions 
and 

additional 
remedies. 
The 

claimant’s wishes, the evidence 
and the code of conduct all 
play a part in the decision.

If 
the 
coordinator 

decides the case should be 
investigated, they’ll assign an 
investigator, usually a member 
of the Title IX staff, to the file. 
The investigator meets with 
the claimant, the respondent 
(the alleged abuser) and any 
relevant witnesses on separate 
occasions 
to 
offer 
them 

the opportunity to present 
information 
and 
evidence. 

During these meetings, the 
policy 
dictates 
both 
the 

claimant and the respondent 
can have an “adviser” of their 
choice — that’s code for a lawyer.

According to the policy, the 

University tries to complete 
every investigation within 60 
days, though it acknowledges 

extenuating 
circumstances 

might lengthen the timeline. 
Regardless of the length, the 
policy stipulates both parties 
will 
be 
updated 
regularly.

After 
the 
interviews 

have 
been 
conducted 
and 

the 
evidence 
collected, 

the investigator will write 
what’s called a “preliminary 
investigation 
report” 
that 

includes 
all 
the 
known 

information. 
Both 
parties 

can 
review 
the 
draft 

report, and they have five 
days 
to 
submit 
comments.

But 
in 
practice, 
the 

process isn’t so regimented.

After 
Taylor’s 
mother 

called OIE, the investigation 
officially commenced on June 
20. Taylor said she immediately 
requested a no-contact order, 
which 
meant 
neither 
she 

nor her GSI could initiate 
any 
kind 
of 
contact 
with 

each other — not in person, 
over text or on social media. 
 

As per the U-M policy, OIE 

senior 
investigator 
Daniel 

Ferency was assigned to be 
the investigator in the case. 
Taylor said Ferency reached 
out to her to ask if she wanted 
to give a statement. They 
exchanged emails to find a 
time to meet, and like the 
policy 
mandates, 
Ferency 

alerted 
Taylor 
to 
support 

resources on campus she could 
access if she wanted. He also 
said she had the right to bring 
a lawyer or any other support 
person 
to 
their 
meeting.

When she got to the meeting, 

though, Taylor was caught 
off-guard. A note-taker was 
present at the meeting, taking 
down her comments while 
Ferency questioned her on her 
experience. She said she wasn’t 
given any warning there would 
be a stranger in the room.

Shortly after the meeting 

with Ferency, she left for a 
summer study abroad trip. 
It was taking a while for 
her medical records to be 
submitted 
to 
Ferency 
as 

evidence, and she emailed him 
about it on June 27 to remind 
him she was still working 
on 
getting 
them 
to 
him.

“You should look out for your 

statement 
either 
tomorrow 

or Friday,” he replied to her 
via 
email 
that 
same 
day.

However, Taylor didn’t hear 

anything else from Ferency 
until July 16 — over three weeks 

after he said he would pass 
along her statement for review.

“When we met on June 19, 

2018, I mentioned that the 
next step in the OIE process 
would be for me to send you 
a summary of your interview 
statement for your review,” 
Ferency wrote in his email. 
“A copy of the summary is 
attached. As we discussed, you 
are not required to review this 
summary. If you choose to 
review it, it can be helpful to 
have a support person present 
… If you decide to review 
this summary, the deadline 
to provide any comments or 
suggestions you may have is 
July 18, 2018. If I don’t hear 
from you by July 18, 2018, I 
will assume you approve of the 
statement as drafted, and will 
move forward with the review.”

During 
this 
process, 

Taylor 
was 
out 
of 
the 

country, 
in 
another 
time 

zone, 
without 
anyone 

who could be an effective 
“support 
person” 
for 
her.

Taylor said she found 15 

mistakes in the report and 
sent her corrections to the 
investigator. 
Eventually, 

Ferency did grant her extra 
time 
to 
make 
corrections, 

and 
she 
turned 
in 
her 

revised copy of the statement 
as soon as she was able.

The next time she heard 

from Ferency was at the end 
of August, just after the 
60-day mark, when she shared 
him on a Google document 
containing screenshots of her 
text messages with her GSI.

Shortly after, the school 

year started. Taylor, who is 
studying music performance, 
had to audition for different 
ensemble classes. One of them 
is a required two-credit class. 
To her horror, she was placed 
in the same GSI’s band class.

After a back and forth with 

OIE and SMTD administrators, 
it 
was 
determined 
Taylor 

could get a waiver for the 
performance 
class, 
which 

meant 
she 
wouldn’t 
need 

to 
fulfill 
that 
graduation 

requirement. 
She 
said 
it 

was a devastating solution.

“That’s six hours a week of 

rehearsal,” she added. “That’s 
four or five concerts in a 
semester. That’s opportunity 
to perform your pieces, work 
with current composers, to 
go play other schools. I’m 

losing all of that while he gets 
to keep that and they don’t 
see anything wrong with it. 
(This is) my only option.”

According to Taylor, there 

are other orchestras or bands 
that need extra players, but she 
hasn’t been asked to participate.

“Instead of asking me, they’re 

asking other students that are 
also not in orchestra but I don’t 
know why they’re not asking 
me because I have nothing,” 
she 
said. 
“Those 
students 

are in band or something ... 
The guy who is head of bands 
here is, like, best friends with 
him and he has made it very 
clear that he does not like me 
and does not support me.”

The director of bands is 

Music prof. Michael Haithcock 
— the GSI’s direct supervisor. 
The Daily reached out to 
Haithcock 
for 
a 
comment. 

He declined to comment via 
email, and said he hoped the 
GSI would sue The Daily 
“if he is found innocent.” 

***
The waiver meant Taylor and 

her GSI would no longer have 
to be in the same classroom. 
But she still had other classes 
in the music school, so she ran 
into him around the building.

She recalled changing her 

shoes in her car one morning 
before class. While she was 
sitting in the car, he pulled up 
right next to her and sat there 
staring for long enough that 
Taylor became uncomfortable.

“I was pretty freaked out 

so I called [SMTD Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion officer 
Freyja Harris] … she found 
me in my car and she actually 
walked me all the way to a 
practice room,” Taylor said.

She 
also 
had 
a 
piano 

class 
in 
the 
basement 
of 

the music school, and said 
the GSI would sit outside 
her 
class 
for 
two 
weeks.

“I 
told 
(SMTD) 
Dean 

(Mark) Clague and I know 
that 
Dean 
Clague 
had 
to 

say something to him more 
than 
once,” 
Taylor 
said. 

“But eventually he stopped.”

Throughout 
these 

experiences at the beginning 
of this school year, she was 
not in regular communication 
with 
Ferency 
or 
anyone 

from OIE. She and Ferency 
exchanged emails on Sept. 5, 
and he gave her directions on 
how to enable her lawyer to 

release medical forms on her 
behalf. But Taylor still had a 
lot of questions about how her 
case was being handled, and no 
one was offering her answers.

She finally turned to SMTD 

administrators and informed 
them of the situation. They were 
upset to find OIE had given 
administrators essentially zero 
information on the situation 
going into the school year.

Taylor said once she and 

her mom got Clague up to 
speed, they found him to be 
very 
helpful. 
However, 
he 

could only do so much, and 
by mid-September, the lack of 
communication and the drawn-
out process finally prompted 
her to request a different 
investigator. On September 18, 
Ferency emailed the student 
to let her know her case had 
been transferred to another 
OIE 
senior 
investigator, 

Suzanne 
Quinn 
McFadden. 

The 
student 
was 
hopeful 

that things would speed up. 
Instead, it was more of the 
same. She didn’t hear anything 
from McFadden until Oct. 5.

“I am writing to let you 

know that I am now working 
on your investigation with 
OIE as your case was recently 
transferred to me,” McFadden 
wrote in an email on Oct. 5. 
“I just wanted to check-in 
with you and offer an update. 
I am currently drafting the 
preliminary 
report 
which 

will be sent to you shortly.”

There was no follow-up to 

let the student know what, 
exactly, 
McFadden 
meant 

by “shortly.” At the time of 
publication of this article, the 
student still has not received 
the 
preliminary 
report.

“I don’t know. It’s been a 

while and I just haven’t seen 
it,” she said. “I haven’t even 
seen 
his 
statement, 
which 

like, it started in June — we 
should 
at 
least 
have 
each 

other’s statements by now.”

On Oct. 12, Elizabeth Seney, 

deputy Title IX Coordinator 
for 
Investigations, 
emailed 

the student to tell her the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Sixth Circuit’s recent decision, 
which determined that public 
universities have to give accused 
students the opportunity to 
cross-examine 
the 
accuser 

and witnesses at an in-person 
hearing, will apply to her case.

According 
to 
an 
email 

interview 
with 
Jeffery 

Frumkin, 
the 
newinterim 

Title 
IX 
coordinator 
and 

senior director of OIE, the 
University is still developing 
the process for these hearings. 
But this likely means this 
particular investigation will 
continue to be drawn out.

Taylor is wary of what 

this process will look like.

“I don’t trust any process 

coming from this school,” she 
said. “I don’t want to do ‘the 
cross-examination.’ But I also 
don’t want him to get away free.”

SMTD is also becoming a 

hostile environment for Taylor. 
She said one of her professors 
dismissed her sexual assault 
claims during class when she 
was absent during the first 
few weeks of the fall semester. 
She 
also 
said 
Haithcock 

blocked 
her 
on 
Facebook.

But 
she 
did 
have 
some 

positive 
interactions 
with 

faculty. She confided in her 
private music teacher about 
her situation and also felt 
like she had strong contact 
with Clague. Clague referred 
The Daily to Public Affairs 
when reached for comment.

She is sometimes escorted 

from her car and to classes 
by Harris, SMTD Diversity, 
Equity 
and 
Inclusion 

officer, who Taylor said was 
also 
a 
comforting 
figure 

in 
the 
administration. 
 

Harris is unable to comment 

on specific investigations due 
to FERPA rules. She explained 
to The Daily, however, that 
while 
her 
role 
rapidly 
is 

becoming a support system for 
SMTD students and faculty, 
she needs to remind them that 
she is not always the point 
person to go to because she 
does not investigate claims.

“In order to be able to 

support someone in my ongoing 
role, I need to let them know 
who is the right person to share 
to,” she said. “I don’t want to 
muddy the water — I want to 
support them. So, it’s what I 
tell them up front — you can 
tell me anything but I am not 
going to be the one to take you 
to the rest of the process. It 
depends on the situation. I am 
trying not to create issues (for 
the students) in their process.”

facing many students today is they 
seem to orient themselves in the 
absence of adequate historical 
knowledge,” North said.

The culprits of this lack of 

knowledge 
among 
youth, 
in 

North’s view, are the educational 
institutions in which they are 
taught.

“There is an utterly reactionary 

climate that prevails in many of 
the humanities departments of 
many universities, such as the 
University of Michigan,” North 
said. “The prevailing philosophy is 
postmodernism, which … is culled 
from the basement of bourgeois 
thought. It is the most backward, 
reactionary 
and 
dishonest 
of 

all approaches to the study or 
consideration of the past.”

North 
also 
criticized 

the affirmative action policies 
of many universities, which he 
portrayed as “quota systems.” 
He said the systems facilitate 
competition among students and 
divide society while competing for 
access to higher education. The 
Supreme Court upheld the state 
of Michigan’s ban on affirmative 
action policies in 2014, claiming the 
U.S. Constitution does not give the 
judicial branch the power to decide 
whether race can be used as a fact 
in the admissions process without 
voter input.

“Students are forced to compete 

for a limited number of positions, 
with applications asking for race 
and ethnicity … We know that 
quota systems are being set up,” 
North said. “There is no way a 
quota system can ever be fair.”

North posited these campus 

issues have much to do with the 
economic standing of professors. 
He said these wages for professors 
make the educators unable to 
understand 
the 
problems 
of 

students.

“If you’re a tenured professor … 

your wealth is in the top 10 percent 

and probably closer to the top 5 
percent,” North said.

As a response, North encouraged 

students to challenge this status 
quo both at the University and 
nationwide by engaging with 
socialist theory.

“I think as young people 

are drawn into social struggle 
they will come to recognize 
the incompatibility of what is 
presented 
on 
campuses 
from 

genuine revolutionary scientific 
theory,” North said.

North’s 
criticisms 
also 

targeted 
organizations 
such 

as 
the 
Democratic 
Socialists 

of America and contemporary 
figures on the American left, 
including Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., and congressional candidate 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He said 
his criticisms stemmed from their 
insufficient opposition to American 
foreign policy, as well as their focus 
on identity politics.

“A 
socialist 
who 
preaches 

national 
defense 
is 
a 
petty 

bourgeois reactionary at the service 
of the king capitalism,” North said. 
“When Bernie Sanders goes around 
defending America (and) praising 
Trump for defending America’s 
borders, he exposes himself as 
a petty bourgeois charlatan and 
reactionary.”

North decried the inadequacy 

of 
today’s 
leftist 
parties 
in 

promoting a worldwide socialist 
revolution, claiming the parties 
veer from campaign promises 
once elected.

LSA freshman Noah Streng 

said he found the event interesting 
and said engaging with socialist 
theory has changed his worldview 
since arriving at the University.

“I wish more people would 

have come out to come see it,” 
Streng said. “I started … learning 
about socialism a lot more since 
I got to college, and it’s really 
changed my perspective on the 
world pretty much upside down.”

Ang’s colleague on the study, 

Tuo-Yen 
Chen 
of 
Nanyang 

Technological 
University 
in 

Singapore, was also interested 
in how social media could alter 
pain’s role in depression.

“Social media has not been 

considered 
as 
a 
potential 

intervention 
strategy,” 
Chen 

said. “So, Shannon and I were 
wondering 
whether 
utilizing 

social 
media 
could 
lessen 

depression 
among 
individuals 

with pain.”

With 
the 
onset 
of 
such 

discomfort 
among 
elderly 

individuals, 
social 
interactions 

outside of the household naturally 
become limited. Ang and Chen 
sought to study how those affected 
could potentially be influenced by 
virtual interaction through social 
media.

Before the study, Ang and Chen 

hypothesized that social media 
usage would be helpful in relieving 
depression amid pain and that 
people might already be using 
social media to supplement their 
own social networking.

The 
basis 
of 
Ang 
and 

Chen’s research emerged from 

the National Health and Aging 
Trends Study, a publicly available 
data set that gathers information 
from more than 8,000 senior 
citizen Medicare beneficiaries.

“The purpose of NHATS is to 

foster research to guide efforts to 
reduce disability, maximize health 
and independent functioning and 
enhance quality of life at older 
ages,” Vicki Freedman, a research 
professor 
at 
the 
University’s 

Institute for Social Research’s 
Survey 
Research 
Center 
and 

a 
co-principal 
investigator 
of 

NHATS, said.

The survey asks its participants 

general questions on if they 

are 
experiencing 
feelings 
of 

depression, pain or have trouble 
falling asleep. In addition to queries 
on depressive symptoms, NHATS 
also inquires about senior citizens’ 
online activities.

For the purpose of their study, 

Ang and Chen focused mainly on 
the responses to the single question 
of if respondents had used a social 
media site in the past month. 
According to the survey, 17 percent 
of respondents had used a social 
networking platform in the past 
month.

SOCIALISM
From Page 1


R

ecently, with the marked 
radicalization 
of 
U.S. 
politics, 
the 
discussion 
of socialism has resurfaced as an 
actual governmental solution for the 
problems facing the United States. In 
fact, just the other day, I was walking 
across the Diag at the University of 
Michigan and a large banner read that 
“capitalism has failed” and “socialism 
has the answer.” Initially, I had just 
scoffed at it, thinking of it as just 
another one of those socialist “seize 
the means of production” memes. But 
when I looked into it, I realized this 
was an actual problem.
According 
to 
a 
Harvard 
Institute of Politics poll in 
spring 2016, 33 percent of the 
18 to 29-year-old respondents 
supported 
socialism 
and 
a 
startling 
51-percent 
majority 
did not support capitalism. The 
Chicago Tribune cited a study in 
which 44 percent of the young 
respondents would prefer living 
in a socialist country. Obviously, 
there was something that was 
changing the political dynamics 
of the millennial generation, so 
I set out to look at some of the 
major points made by those in 
support of socialism and dissect 
why some of my peers had begun 
to lean so far left.
Desire for economic equality 
was the most frequently cited 
reason for support. As stated by 
Anthony Giddens in The Class 
Structures 
of 
the 
Advanced 
Studies, socialist societies cause 
the “disappearance of classes.” 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., used 
this argument frequently in his 
attacks on the top 1 percent. But 
I question, is income inequality 
really that big of an issue?
When 
an 
economy 
is 
restructured such that it is 
socialist — as defined by Merriam 
Webster dictionary — “a system 
or condition of society in which 
the means of production are 
owned and controlled by the 
state.” (It’s worth noting that 
there are many other definitions 
out there, yet this seems to be the 
most widely accepted). As such, 
there is no freedom of choice 
in your labor. It is by default 
owed to the state. Because of 
this, there is no free market in 
which supply is meeting demand. 
Rather, people don’t have many 
options in purchasing a good 
and are forced to pay others for 
work they may — and perhaps 
even society as a whole — find 
unnecessary. 
In 
this 
sense, 
socialism actually suppresses an 
individual’s freedom to choose 
how they want to live.
For example, consider I have 

a lemonade stand in the Upper 
Peninsula. When it gets cold 
outside, I will not get very many 
customers. Because of this, I will 
be forced to close my shop and 
find another endeavor that will 
cater to the market so I can make 
money. I make a choice to provide 
for the whims of society for my 
own survival. If I go against 
the market, there is decreased 
demand for my product and I 
will not earn as much. However, 
in a socialist economy, the 
government owns the means 
of production for my lemonade 
shop. The government defines 
what the market needs, and as 
such, defines when and which 
type of lemonade an individual 
can consume.
By doing this, the government 
forces a redistribution of wealth 
in the population — something 
that has gained a lot of support 
recently. But this is largely 
immoral, and here’s why. Using 
the same metaphor, imagine 
I have invented a new type of 
lemonade that not only tastes 
great but is also very healthy. 
Suddenly, as a result of my hard 
work, there is a lot of demand 
for my product and I become 
part of the 1 percent. Then, the 
government comes by and says I 
shouldn’t be allowed to be making 
that much money because there 
are people who are making much 
less than I am. As a result, they 
redistribute my added wealth to 
the poor, deciding for me how 
much money I need.
The money that I got from 
selling the lemonade, however, 
is money I earned. Blatantly 
taking it from me on the pretense 
of equity is theft. Now, I’m not 
saying there shouldn’t be taxes. 
There are things — public goods 
— that the government provides 
and for which it should charge 
me, such as the military, police, 
etc. But I don’t, in any way, owe 
my money to those under the 
poverty line. I did not steal from 
them to get rich — I made the 
money entirely on my own.
Perhaps a more dangerous side 
effect of this idea of equity in 
wealth is a lack of competition. 
If I knew I, as a lemonade maker, 
would make the same amount 
of money no matter what I did, 
would I have decided to innovate 
and create that better tasting, 
healthy 
lemonade? 
Probably 
not. I would have done the 
bare minimum, as there was no 
incentive for me to do any better. 
I would get paid the same. This 
is perhaps the greatest aspect 
of capitalism. A free market 

means that there will always 
be competition, and therefore 
innovation. 
Without 
a 
free 
market, Jeff Bezos would not 
have had the incentive to create 
Amazon. Nor would Larry Page 
and Sergey Brin have created 
Google.
Obviously, the example of 
the lemonade stand was an 
oversimplification 
of 
a 
very 
complex 
economy. 
However, 
the basic principles that drive 
its existence in a capitalist 
and socialist society still hold 
true. There’s a reason why 
the standard of living in the 
United 
States 
has 
increased 
so dramatically over the last 
few decades. There’s a reason 
why the Heritage Foundation 
reports that “62 percent of 
‘poor’ households own a car,” 
with 
“poor” 
operationalized 
as “anyone with ‘cash income’ 
less than the official poverty 
threshold.” There’s a reason why 
the United States leads the rest 
of the world in scientific and 
technological innovation.
So, to answer my previous 
question, 
no. 
I 
don’t 
think 
income inequality is something 
we need to be very concerned 
about. A study by the Brookings 
Institution said of Americans who 
have at least finished high school, 
got a full-time job and waited 
until age 21 to get married and 
have children, only 2 percent are 
in poverty and nearly 75 percent 
are in the middle class. Just those 
three things. As long as every 
individual has equal opportunity 
in being able to do those things, 
the resulting inequality is of 
little matter. All people should 
feel capable of being able to 
move between classes if they 
work toward it. In this sense, 
inequality is actually a positive 
force, creating competition and 
thereby 
providing 
incentives 
for individuals to work toward 
benefiting human society. The 
market 
will 
simply 
reward 
individuals 
based 
on 
their 
contributions to it.
This is not to say that we have 
reached that point yet. There 
are obviously many flaws in the 
United States that prevent equal 
access to some basic institutions. 
To solve these issues, there are 
two approaches: one that uses 
the government more and one 
that doesn’t. Both are very valid 
approaches, about which debate 
is warranted.

Put the act in activism
W

hen social media rose 
in popularity in the 
early 2000s, it was 
difficult to imagine it would have 
the influence in our lives that it 
currently does. The connectivity, 
creation of personal platforms and 
ability of the everyday person to 
share information and ideas almost 
instantaneously has created a new 
level of public discourse that is 
historically unimaginable. With a 
simple Wi-Fi connection, anyone 
is able to publicly present their 
opinions, call for change or engage 
with national leaders and public 
figures. And with this new power 
of the people, it would be difficult 
to deny the effect of social media 
campaigns in our current social and 
political climate, especially those 
with such widespread support for 
#NeverAgain and #MeToo. These 
movements have led to pervasive 
demonstrations across the country, 
especially among young people. 
Incited and motivated by students 
following the Parkland shooting 
on Feb. 14, #NeverAgain led to 
national 
protests 
in 
American 
schools on March 14. #MeToo has 
been exposing stories of sexual 
harassment and assault primarily 
on social media since actress Alyssa 
Milano’s use of the hashtag in fall 
2017. This brought it to the forefront 
of American social movements, 
despite its 2006 creation by activist 
Tarana Burke. Social media has 
the power to both create and 
revive topics of social and political 
importance.

The hashtag itself has become a 
popular symbol of support, standing 
before some of the most pressing 
issues of our time. By searching 
through hashtags, social media users 
are able to see a full thread of people 
discussing what they are interested 
in. They are able to join in by posting 
opinions or stories, sharing those of 
others or engaging in conversation 
with those who both agree and 
dissent. There is a connectivity never 
before available that spreads the 
ideas of our nation across state lines 
almost immediately.
And with the most recent 
political trouble of Justice Brett 
Kavanaugh’s 
Supreme 
Court 
confirmation, social media again has 
been an important way for citizens 
to debate, present opinions, or clarify 
details and facts. These movements 
are guided even further into the 
limelight through the support of 
celebrities and users with large 
followings, as evident from the 
plethora of celebrity commentary 
regarding Kavanaugh. Entertainers 
Ellen DeGeneres, Chelsea Handler, 
Ava DuVernay, Amy Schumer and 
countless others have posted their 
support for Christine Blasey Ford 
and America’s women following 
this appointment, but one strong 
emphasis has been made among 
many 
of 
these 
statements 
of 
sympathy and the need for action: 
Vote.
While 
social 
media 
is 
undoubtedly 
a 
great 
platform 
to spread information and gain 
support for political and social 

issues, this does not directly equate 
to consistent action. Retweeting 
an infographic or powerfully-
written thread on Twitter can 
make someone feel as if they are 
engaged in our nation’s politics, but 
in reality, social media is frequently 
used as a passive form of activism. 
Despite social media’s usefulness 
in movements, this activism — 
referred to as slacktivism — can 
oftentimes end with a simple 
share. Agreeing with something 
and posting a brief opinion about 
it does not always materialize into 
something actionable. Social media 
users, especially those who were 
raised in the age of social media and 
are accustomed to being bombarded 
with 
a 
constant 
stream 
of 
information, can treat movements 
like trends. While everyone else 
is posting about a topic, they feel 
as though they should too. Social 
media encompasses vast amounts 
of social pressure, and many users 
follow these trends to keep in tune 
with the landscape of their favorite 
social networking sites. It’s the 
basis of their newsfeed for the 
week surrounding the event, but 
when the timeline starts returning 
to its original mix of news and 
personal updates, so does their 
real-life concern about the issue. 
Slacktivism.

Socialism is not the answer

Can Dems ever beat the system?
W

ith the 2018 midterm 
elections fewer than 
three 
weeks 
away, 
experts find the Democrats have a 
higher chance of winning back the 
House of Representatives than the 
Senate. Senate and House candidates 
are running in the same country 
with the same problems and political 
climate — why is there a six in seven 
chance Democrats can win back 
the House but only two in nine for 
the Senate? One reason is that there 
aren’t nearly as many Republican 
Senate seats up for election as there 
are Democratic seats. This certainly 
accounts for some of the disparity in 
chances, but there is also a much more 
fundamental component working 
against the Democrats — one that 
should be even more of an impetus 
for soul-searching than the 2016 
election. The Senate systematically 
favors the voices of Americans in 
less-populated states over those in 
densely-populated urban centers.
This is because of the Great 
Compromise. If you cannot seem to 
recall the details of that agreement 
from AP U.S. History, I’ll give a 
quick overview: In drafting the 
Constitution, delegates from different 
states had varied ideas about how 
best to form the most “perfect union.” 
A large controversy — one that nearly 
prevented the Constitution from ever 
being ratified — was deciding whether 
to choose the New Jersey Plan or 
the Virginia plan. The New Jersey 
Plan proposed that each state would 
be granted equal representation 
in the federal legislative body, 
despite differences in population. 
The 
Virginia 
Plan 
proposed 
that representation be based on 
population, so more populated states 
would be given more votes than less 
populated ones. Rather than choose 
one plan, the framers decided to have 
a bicameral legislature — one house 
(House of Representatives) would be 
given representation proportional to 
population and the other (the Senate) 
would have two representatives from 

each state, regardless of population 
size.
But the two legislative bodies 
aren’t necessarily equal in power or 
purview — for example, the Senate 
has the power to ratify treaties and 
confirm presidential appointees. So, 
the house with equal representation 
amongst states is more powerful 
than the one that would favor 
more populated states. This sounds 
fair, but if we focus on the voices 
of individuals rather than states, 
the house that disproportionately 
represents individuals from less 
populated states holds much more 
power than that which represents 
individual 
voices 
more 
evenly. 
The population distribution of the 
country has drastically changed 
since the 18th century — only one in 
five Americans lives in a rural area 
today. This has huge implications for 
the representativeness of the Senate. 
States containing only 17 percent 
of the U.S. population could have a 
majority in the Senate on their own. 
In a modern context, the Senate 
was responsible for confirming 
the most recent Supreme Court 
nominee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. 
The majority that confirmed him, 51 
senators, represented only 44 percent 
of the United States population.
Because the Senate is such a 
powerful political institution and it is 
constructed in a manner that favors 
the population within less populated 
states, it is imperative that both major 
parties have a strong presence in 
these states. Democrats tend to excel 
in more urban, densely-populated 
areas though, while Republicans are 
favored in rural areas, and this divide 
is only becoming more salient. Many 
experts theorize that this divide 
is born out of the contemporary 
“culture wars” — an ongoing battle 
between 
“traditional” 
American 
values and the multiculturalism and 
progressivism of the left. I am not 
equipped with the research to affirm 
or disavow that idea. It certainly holds 
some amount of explanatory power, 

though a single story rarely provides 
a holistic picture. And as hard as 
red-state Democrats have tried to 
stay away from centering culturally-
relevant 
issues, 
they 
inevitably 
arise and find their way into the 
conversation.
For 
example, 
Sen. 
Heidi 
Heitkamp, D-North Dakota, is 
fighting an uphill battle in her 
re-election campaign, and her 
support of Brett Kavanaugh proved 
to be harmful to her poll numbers. 
There is a strong chance she would 
have lost enthusiasm among her 
base had she voted the other way, 
though. This instance feels like a 
microcosm of Democrats’ larger 
identity crisis: Their base is simply 
too densely packed to win in our 
system, but straying from the base’s 
priorities might cause that base 
to become disillusioned with the 
party and the democratic process in 
general. 
Thus, the Democrats are in a 
bind, and they will be until they 
find a message powerful enough 
to break through the urban-rural 
divide. 
The 
electoral 
system 
is replete with un-democratic 
institutions like the Senate, the 
electoral college, gerrymandering 
and systemic voter suppression. 
The latter two have made their way 
into the mainstream Democratic 
fight, (and they’re on the ballot in 
the form of Proposal 2 and 3 for 
Michigan voters this November! 
Remember to vote, because we can 
work toward change in our system!) 
but the electoral college tends to 
be viewed in a similar vein as the 
Senate: It is an institution so deeply 
ingrained into our system that any 
attempt at changing it feels like a 
futile battle. As long as that is the 
attitude, Democrats must focus on 
overcoming the divide if they have 
any hope of gaining federal power.

The issue that was #NeverAgain talked about
R

emember back in February 
when we had the school 
shooting in Parkland and 
we started having protests because 
people were mad that, you know, kids 
were dying? Yeah, remember that? 
Do you also remember how nothing 
actually changed? Well, now is the 
time to fix that. 
With midterm elections just 
around the corner, it’s time to recall 
these issues that seem to fade into 
the background a month after they 
happen and actually do something 
about it. The first question is: What do 
we do?
We know why some form of 
gun control is necessary. Kids are 
dying from a lack of regulation on 
dangerous weapons. I’m not going 
to waste too much time trying to 
convince anyone who doesn’t think 
the Second Amendment is outdated, 
seeing as it was written over 200 years 
ago when guns shot one bullet at a 
time, and that laws can and should be 
changed because that’s just common 
sense. Considering things like slavery 
were legal and women and African-
Americans didn’t have the right to vote 
in the original Constitution, I’m sure 
we can all agree that some change 
truly is good.
There are plenty of ways to 
deal with the current issue of gun 
control. One common idea is stricter 
background checks. According to 
The Trace, current background 
checks are riddled with loopholes 
and typically take only minutes, 
and just 2 percent end in rejection. 
With the NRA controlling gun sales 
with little effective government 
regulation, guns can easily fall into 
dangerous hands. According to CNN, 
universal background checks have 
been associated with a 39-percent 
reduction in death, and federal laws 
expanding background checks have 
been predicted to reduce the death 

rate by 57 percent. Implementing 
these changes would take very little 
away from gun enthusiasts and would 
simply make the process safer.
Also on the table are mandatory 
trainings, practice times, waiting 
periods and first and second-level 
licensing, making acquiring a gun 
similar to a driver’s license. This, paired 
with making assault weapons and 
bump stocks, which are attachments 
that allow semi-automatic weapons to 
act as fully automatic weapons, illegal 
gives us much more comprehensive 
gun laws that could lead to fewer 
incidents such as Parkland.
Now that the midterm elections 
are upon us, these ideas finally have a 
chance to see the light of day, or should 
I say, the eyes of Congress. This is our 
first chance since Parkland to really 
voice our opinions on this crisis in a 
direct, consequential way. Many of us 
participated in marches and protests 
in the wake of the Parkland shooting, 
calling for these changes, among 
others, which is fantastic. Protesting 
is a great way to generate support for 
an issue. But no matter how many 
protests you go to, if you don’t actually 
vote for the change you’re marching 
for, no change will come.
In the coming weeks, look for 
candidates that support stricter gun 
control laws. In the race for Senate, 
Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., 
supports 
banning 
high-capacity 
magazines with more than 10 bullets, 
and prohibiting foreign and U.N. aid 
that restricts U.S. gun ownership. She 
opposes allowing firearms in checked 
baggage on Amtrak trains, prohibiting 
lawsuits against gun manufacturers, 
banning 
lawsuits 
against 
gun 
manufacturers for gun violence and 
decreasing gun waiting period from 
three days to one.
Likewise, Green Party candidate 
Marcia Squier supports graduated 
licensing, training for guns and 

universal background checks. In 
contrast, 
Republican 
candidate 
John James considers the Second 
Amendment the be-all and end-all of 
gun control.
For governor, Democrat Gretchen 
Whitmer 
supports 
strengthening 
gun laws by adding safety locks 
and background checks. However, 
Republican Bill Schuette is endorsed 
by the NRA for his unwavering 
support of the Second Amendment.
The University of Michigan 
is doing its part to protect those 
involved in the shootings and in 
the protests against gun violence. 
In February, the University issued 
a statement saying that they would 
honor students’ rights to free 
speech if disciplinary actions were 
taken against them during protests 
against the Parkland shootings. The 
University is now awarding the 2018 
Wallenberg Medal to the B.R.A.V.E. 
(Bold Resistance Against Violence 
Everywhere) Youth Leaders of the 
Faith Community of Saint Sabina 
and March For Our Lives from 
Parkland, Fla., on Nov. 14 at 7:30 
p.m. in the Rackham Auditorium. 
Representatives from both groups 
will be present to receive this award. 
Now it’s the students’ turn.
The support rallied in the 
wake of the Parkland shooting by 
students and universities alike was 
inspiring. Millions of kids and adults 
banded together to make positive 
change. But within three months, 
the demonstrations faded into the 
shadows. We cannot let this movement 
die out. Now is the time to act. Vote 
responsibly and knowledgeably. Vote 
for people who will protect your rights 
and your schools. Now is your chance 
to enact change.

After 
scouring 
through 

the perfectly aesthetic and 
thought-out Instagram feeds of 
fashion icons and style bloggers 
from across the world, I often 
think to myself: What is my 
personal aesthetic? How do I 
stand out and speak about who 
I am through the way I appear? 
This is a question that puzzles 
many of us, especially as young 
adults who are still learning to 
navigate the complex maze that 
is the world of fashion.

Before delving deeper into 

the semantics of style, it is 
essential to understand what 
it means to have a personal 
style. Does it equate to having a 
quasi-uniform that defines you 
by being the only theme in your 
closet, or is there something to 
more to it? It has often been seen 
that having a personal style is 
associated with a patterned use 
of a particular fabric, type of 
dressing or silhouettes, to name 
a few. As a result, some would 
say that their style is more 
athletic, while some would call 
theirs denim-oriented. But it 
really boils down to having that 
one thing which clicks for you. 
Taking the example of Victoria 
Beckham, her style is not 
limited by colors, fabrics or even 
the type of garment but does 
indeed have one overarching 
theme: 
minimalism. 
More 

importantly, 
one’s 
personal 

style is regularly thought to be 
clothes-centric when the truth 
of the matter is that it could 
encompass any part of the 
overall physical image. Thus 
accessories, makeup and even 
shoes are all fair game when it 
comes to labelling something as 
a “style.” To put things simply: 
Having a personal style means 
having a theme that is constant, 
and it can take multiple shapes 
and sizes.

While it’s not very hard to 

grasp the concept of having a 
personal style, defining it for 
oneself is an entirely different 
ballgame. Most of us youth 
today tend to explore a variety 
of trends and are constantly 
striving to be in the know, 
hence seldom do we consciously 
recognize the pattern in our 
choices. Understanding what it 
means to have a personal style 
and then defining it greatly 
complement one another due to 
the fact that they are influenced 
by the same set of factors. Both 
involve an understanding our 
own self and identity in terms 
of not only what suits our body 
the best but also what truly 
reflects our personality. This 
is then followed by finding 
the signature pieces that rule 
the dynamic of our closet to 
eventually 
building 
around 

the mood projected by those. 
It sounds like an awful lot 
of things need to be done 
when most of it is actually 
subconscious. However, it does 
require time. In many ways, the 
theme of our image needs to be 
isolated from factors such as 
seasons and trends, though this 
does not mean that it is to be 
frozen in a set frame.

As ideal as it sounds to be 

able to ignore other factors, 
it isn’t always reality. This is 
something that we are more 
than well aware of. In a world 
that 
is 
so 
fast-paced, 
the 

fashion industry is not one 
to be left behind with trends 
changing as early as a fortnight. 
Inadvertently, 
stability 
and 

consistency are not always 
available. In the past decade, 
the fashion industry has seen a 
dramatic rise in the number and 
the diversity in trends, be it the 

pairing of graphic t-shirts that 
have a ’90s vibe with something 
more chic or the return of 
pastel colors and fanny packs. 
We want to belong to each niche 
coterie but still remain true to 
the image of ourselves that we 
have constructed.

The 
next 
question 
that 

arises is how one finds the 
balance between exploring this 
constantly expanding galaxy 
but still retaining an individual 
sense of style. I believe a big 
part of answering this question 
comes from the ability to 
visualize what our ideal closet 
looks like. Is it one that is 
dominated by a single theme and 
does not deviate, or is it one that 
is constantly evolving but can 
yet identify with a consistent 
trope? With factors such as 
fast fashion and social media 
having such a huge presence 
in our life, the scope of a trend 
cannot be predicted. Some 
brands churn out collections 
as per micro seasons that 
usually last anywhere between 
two to four weeks while social 
media propagates the next big 
thing. Speaking from personal 
experience, the width of the 
choices available regarding all 
facets of style, ranging from 
clothes to accessories, baffle 
me. For a person who prefers 
dressing in basics with a touch 
of professionalism but also 
enjoys exploring new ideas, 
I am often at a loss of how to 

find the best of both worlds. 
However, what I am coming 
to learn is that it isn’t as hard 
as it seems. Instead I see my 
approach to my wardrobe as a 
threefold process.

The 
first 
might 
sound 

overused, but it is indeed simply 
learning to be confident in my 
choices. It is unsettling to see 
everyone around you look a 
certain way and even if that 
does not call to you, there is an 
underlying pressure to conform. 
However, Carolina Herrera — 
classic fashion designer — put it 
very aptly: “If everyone follows 
trends, then we will all look the 
same, and what fun is that?” 
Recognizing what works for 
you is integral and if you don’t 
feel it, that piece of fashion is 
never truly yours.

The second step in defining 

one’s style is understanding 
what the core trend is — 
whether it is the fabric, style, 
cut or even the embellishment. 
Taking the example of bomber 
jackets, they have been a hit 
with the masses for a while now 
and each store has a different 
take on them. However, at 
the core, the trend isn’t really 
the jacket itself. Rather, it is 
the touch of masculinity that 
it provides which could be 
achieved through a biker jacket, 
or the way you accessorize or 
even the shoes one wears. This 
allows me to find the same 
thread in my theme and join the 
dots.

Finally, the last step in 

finding this balance is being 
OK with the fact that personal 
style can change with time. It 
is not permanent — instead, it 
should evolve and grow since 
the version that you are this 
moment is not permanent.

As we explore new avenues, 

attempt 
to 
understand 

our image — but moreover 
ourselves, especially as we 
enter adulthood — we question 
the importance of having a 
personal style. Having one can 
definitely have its advantages 
— it lends a certain sense of 
uniformity to one’s image but 
still leaves space for creativity 
and varied expression. Ideally, 
it makes you feel better, since it 
tends to be the embodiment of 
pieces and ideas that give you 
happiness. Furthermore, one’s 
personal style often reflects 
what inspires them, which can 
be motivating because when 
you feel good, you end up doing 
better. However, not having 
been able to identify one or 
choosing not to have a particular 
style is not something bad 
either. At this point in our lives, 
we are still figuring out what 
we want to do and who we want 
to be — answers often reflected 
through our image. Not having 
those is perfectly OK. 

One’s personal style is not 

limited to the clothes or the 
way he or she looks, but it 
is 
an 
encompassing 
theme 

in our lives. And not having 
one gives us the freedom to 
be 
more

“When the Night 

Comes for Us”

Netflix

As ideal as it 

sounds to be able 

to ignore other 

factors, it isn’t 

always reality. 

This is something 

that we are more 

than well aware 

of. In a world 

that is so fast-

paced, the fashion 

industry is not one 

to be left behind 

with trends 

changing as early 

as a fortnight. 

The fall cold and rain was 

more than obvious, both from 
the natural lighting set up of 
the Forum at the University 
of Michigan Museum of Art 
(UMMA) and also from the chill 
that rushed in every time doors 
flew open as people poured in 
for MUSIC Matters’s “A Night 
at the Museum” concert. But 
perhaps the point was coziness; 
the audience was laid-back but 
grooving as they danced and 
sipped on their fizzy drinks 
under dim, yellow lighting to the 
sound of the performances.

“A Night at the Museum” 

followed the more extravagant 
SpringFest, an annual MUSIC 
festival 
hosted 
every 
April 

at the University by MUSIC 
Matters. The proceeds from the 
event were used to fund MUSIC 
Matters’s first social venture 
with Books for a Benefit, a 
nonprofit organization founded 
on campus. “A Night at the 
Museum” delivered the same 
level of ambition as SpringFest 
to unify the campus with music, 
sparking social change on a 
microcosmic level. It operated 
on a smaller scale, at a more 
compact venue with special 
attention to some of the local 
performances from SpringFest: 
The Kelseys, Andrea Doria and 
OSSI MUSIC. The effect was an 
event unlike anything else I’ve 
encountered at past concerts as 
three completely unrelated, yet 

equally as impacting, acts took to 
the stage.

Each act had a sound and style 

that was distinctly their own. 
The Kelseys, a band consisting 
of a lead singer, guitar player, 
bassist and drummer, had an 
alternative rock sound that was 
undeniably peppy even when 
lyrics veered into a more somber 
realm. It gave me the same effect 
as listening to Young the Giant 
or Vampire Weekend. I was 
especially drawn to the stage 
presence and personality of the 
members as they each grooved 
to the music in their own distinct 
way: The bassist was intensely 
focused on his playing, the 
drummer’s smile was contagious 
as he broke into silent fits of 
laughter, the guitarist’s dance 
moves were wide and smooth and 
the lead singer was deliberate in 
his close-eyed singing.

Andrea Doria can also be 

described 
as 
an 
alternative 

rock band that consists three 
members: a drummer and two 
guitar players who alternate as 
lead singers. Each of their songs 
came as a pleasant surprise, one 
psychedelic and sticky, the next 
truer to the alt-rock sound we all 
know and love. The bandmates 
frequently implemented different 
instruments 
throughout 
the 

performance, swapping them 
in and out and between one 
another, allowing each member 
to play to their strengths.

My 
favorite 
performance 

of the night was that of OSSI 
MUSIC. 
Composed 
of 
eight 

members, I found myself losing 

track of who played what as some 
of the members managed to play 
more than one instrument; I 
was especially amazed by the 
member who’d switch from 
keyboard to trumpet, sometimes 
in the same song. Despite a wide 
variety of elements to their 
music, it never felt crowded; 
their sound was meditative and 
subtle, luminous in its sway over 
the audience as each instrument 
and sound was strummed on in 
an as-needed basis. Each lead 
singer also brought forth a style 
and story that was all their own 
when they grabbed the mic, 
their voices bright and emotions 
palpable. I was mesmerized.

Despite having to shift from 

one act to another, the transition 
was seamless. MUSIC Matters 
skillfully facilitated a social 
environment for its audience 
members. From an informal 
introduction to the purpose 
and goals of MUSIC Matters 
to 
DJing 
psychedelic 
music 

between performances, a laid-
back element was prominent and 
well-orchestrated. The obvious 
ease and mingling between the 
members of MUSIC Matters and 
band members in the audience 
only 
added 
to 
the 
casual 

atmosphere of the event.

Overall, “A Night at the 

Museum” was a memorable 
display of the talent of local 
music acts. Though not as 
grand as SpringFest, the event 
achieves MUSIC Matters’s goal 
of unification through music by 
making its expression on campus 
the focal point of the event.

STYLE NOTEBOOK

“The Night Comes for Us” 

turns the gore setting up to 10 in a 
martial-arts showcase, with more 
corn-syrup blood than a Midwest 
corn-maze on Oct. 26 (not everyone 
can go out on a Wednesday). 
And along that line of thinking, 
“Night Comes” might be the best 
Spooktacular option this skeleton 
season, dropping ghosts and ghouls 
in lieu of Indonesian gangsters 
drop-kicking each other. 

Writer/director 
Timo 

Tjahjanto’s (“May the Devil Take 
You”) film follows an ex-Triad 
enforcer Ito (Joe Taslim, “The 
Raid: Redemption”) who, after 
an abrupt moral epiphany, turns 
against the organization to save a 
young girl, Reina (Asha Kenyeri 
Bermudez, 
“The 
Doll”). 
The 

ensuing power-struggle as the 
Triad tries to tie up their loose 
end brings the brawl to a night-
club, a high-rise, a warehouse and 
a human meat locker, evening out 
to be one of the best installments 
of splatter-cinema in a long time. 
“Night 
Comes” 
is 
low-in-the-

throat, involuntary-yelp gory — 
the type of movie that is perfect to 
watch with a group of friends, but 
one that might raise questions if 
you enjoy it a little too much alone. 

The 
focus 

on the story 
and characters 
is light — a 
new 
fighter 

will 
appear 

and 
throw 

themselves into the foray with no 
need for introduction or purpose 
or explanation before they are 
impaled on a meat hook or thrown 

from a building, never to be seen 
again. It’s a movie light on plot, 
and it only could have improved by 
going lighter. Is the aim of everyone 
with a gun in the movie comically 
bad? For sure. Should all martial-
arts movies have a Batman ban 
on firearms? Absolutely. Does the 
Triad seem to have an unending 
supply of goons willing to throw 

themselves 
at 

the good guys? 
Think “World 
War Z” with 
machetes. 
No 

one should go 
through 
the 

trouble of HDMI-ing their laptop 
to their living room TV to watch 
this film if they want a Netflix 
distributed picture with plot. Don’t 

even turn on subtitles, actually. 
Just sit back and watch heads roll.

And 
there’s 
an 
important 

distinction 
to 
be 
made 
here 

between a film that is just so 
candidly gory that it can be made 
out to be fun and a film like “Night 
Comes,” which seems to have been 
specifically crafted by a technical 
hand. The choreography and the 
camera work of the fight scenes 
is second to none, Tjahjanto 
finding ways to incorporate the 
battleground of each scene into 
the action itself. The individual 
characters aren’t as stylized as 
characters in a film by someone 
like Tarantino, but the feel of the 
action — leaving logic at the door — 
is strikingly reminiscent. 

Tjahjanto, 
a 
director 
with 

more than a couple of thrillers 
in his filmography, has a terrific 
understanding of what to show 
in a fight scene. He begins a scene 
by gliding his camera around his 
brawlers, giving the audience a 
sense of where the fighters are 
and what tools in the environment 
might later be at their disposal. No 
stone is left unturned, each of these 
props eventually put to murderous 
use as Tjahjanto bounces through 
the progressing engagement. He 
cuts away very sparingly during 
the fights, giving the action a sense 
of spectacle that disappears when 
each kick or punch gets its own 
shot. The last movie with action as 
impressive as “Night Comes” would 
be “Ip Man,” a lofty comparison in 
terms of martial arts films. 

‘Night Comes’ is a violent 
romp through Indonesia

Nearly every day when I came 
home from middle school, I would 
turn on the TV to find that TNT 
was once again airing “Charmed.” 
Though the show originally aired 
long before I had progressed 
from the likes of Disney and 
Nickelodeon, 
I 
found 
myself 
drawn to its reruns. What more 
could a 13-year-old girl ask for? 
Witches, demons, love stories and 
three powerful sisters — it was a 
helplessly cheesy series I couldn’t 
get enough of, and I’m not the only 
one.
The mention of the original 
“Charmed” conjures a memory in 
many people — mostly women — 
of watching it with their moms, at 
sleepovers or just by themselves 
when they were home sick from 
school.
Perhaps this nostalgia is what 
inspired The CW to bring it back 
— its feminist-centric reboot of 
“Charmed” has just premiered. 
There are some differences: The 
women of the original “Charmed” 
were 
updated 
to 
the 
much-
younger Mel, Macy and Maggie. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
name 
changes, the series plot remains 
pretty much the same: Two of the 
girls find a sister they never knew 
they had, their mother is dead 
and there are demons constantly 

hunting them.
The pilot quickly establishes 
the personalities of each of the 
girls: Maggie, the youngest (Sarah 
Jeffery, “Shades of Blue”), is 
an incoming college freshman 
looking to rush a sorority; Mel, 
the middle sister (Melonie Diaz, 
“The First Purge”), is a stern 
graduate student heavily involved 
in feminist activism. Mel and 
Maggie lived together with their 
mom their whole life, so they are 
shocked when after their mom’s 
death, Macy (Madeleine Mantock, 
“Age Before Beauty”), a brainy new 

hire at the college nearby, shows 
up at their door telling them she’s 
their sister.
From here, the show follows 
the traditional “Charmed” route. 
The sisters meet the cheeky 
whitelighter Harry (Rupert Evans, 
“The Man in the High Castle”) 
who explains to the charmed ones 
that they are powerful witches, 
just like their mother, and that he 
has powers of his own. This sets 
the main conflict of the pilot, with 

the sisters deciding whether they 
want to accept their magical fate.
With all of the similarities 
to the original “Charmed,” the 
reboot had to make some changes 
to establish itself as something 
new. This comes through the often 
heavy-handed “wokeness” that 
permeates the pilot. Some of the 
representation comes naturally 
— all three sisters are women 
of color and the fact that Mel is 
openly gay is less of a plotline than 
a simple detail. The show does 
not want you to forget how woke 
they are, delivering such lines as, 
“Being a witch is a full pro-choice 
enterprise,” and slipping in a dig at 
Donald Trump.
Some may point this out as a 
glaring flaw in the show, but as 
someone that used to watch the 
original “Charmed” religiously, I 
have to disagree. You don’t go to the 
network that airs such mindless, 
guilty-pleasure 
television 
like 
“Riverdale” looking for a top-
quality show. Nobody is going to 
turn on “Charmed” expecting a 
high-caliber script and Emmy-
award winning acting. The viewers 
are going to be people just like I was 
— mostly young, mostly female, 
mostly looking for something 
to entertain them. And if that 
thing just happens to be a show 
that promotes true sisterhood, 
progressive feminism and modern 
pro-women movements, I see no 
problem with that. 

‘Charmed’ revamp brings 
little to the witchy series

‘Bad Times’ conjures ’60s 
nightmares and dreams

Nestled in the pine woods not 
far from Lake Tahoe stands the 
El Royale Hotel, a palace of kitsch 
bisected by the Calif.-Nev. border 
where guests can choose which 
state they would like to stay in. In 
the ’50s it was quite the happening 
place, but today it stands silent and 
empty, taking only the occasional 
guest — a monument to a bygone 
era of bright-eyed American 
optimism. This is where writer-
director Drew Goddard (“The 
Cabin in the Woods”) lays his 
scene in his new film “Bad Times 
at the El Royale.” Set over the 
course of one night, the film 
follows six strangers, the only 
guests at the eponymous hotel. 
Among them is an aging priest 
(Jeff Bridges, “Only the Brave”), 
a 
travelling 
vacuum-cleaner 
salesman (Jon Hamm, “Tag”) and 
a struggling jazz singer (Cynthia 
Erivo, “Widows”). Each of these 
people has a secret, and as the 
night drags on, the guests will 
learn that not all is as it seems at 
the El Royale.
I won’t mince words: “Bad 
Times” was the most fun I’ve had 
watching a movie all year. From 
start to finish, the film crackles 
with energy and an ever-building 
momentum that doesn’t let up 
until the credits roll. This is 
largely thanks to the film’s uber-
talented cast which features 
incendiary performances from 
both its established A-listers and 
its up-and-comers. Particularly 
impressive are the performances 
given by Bridges and Erivo. 
Bridges brings surprising depth to 
his often gritty exterior as Father 
Daniel Flynn, a priest struggling 
with the onset of dementia. Erivo, 
meanwhile, gives the powerhouse 
performance of the film as 
Darlene Sweet, a jazz singer who 
never found her big break. Erivo 

all but disappears into the kind 
hearted but jaded singer who’s 
seen far too much injustice in 
her lifetime; she plays Darlene 
with energy, empathy and an 
unmistakable hint of rage at a 
world that has never seemed to 
give her a moment’s rest.
Throughout its nearly two and 
a half hour runtime (which, mind 
you, never once feels drawn out 
or tedious), the film draws on a 
number of stylistic inspirations 
ranging from the pulp serials 
and B-movies of the ’50s and ’60s 
to the character-driven action 
stylings of Quentin Tarantino. 
That said, to simply call the film 
a tribute piece and leave it at that 
would be wildly underselling the 
directing and storytelling chops of 
Drew Goddard. Unexpectedly one 
of the most visually enthralling 
films of the year, Goddard’s 

camerawork takes the audience 
creeping and swerving through 
the cavernous El Royale, no 
doubt a nod to Stanley Kubrick’s 
iconic tracking shots in “The 
Shining.” What’s more, Goddard 
masterfully weaves a story that 
reaches a thematic depth which 
elevates the film beyond being 
just another style-over-substance 
venture. Goddard isn’t looking to 
merely replicate his favorite pulp 
films; he has got something to say.
Running through the film 
like the bright red line that runs 
through the middle of the El 
Royale is an exploration of binary 
choice. American society is all 
about binary choices: Coke or 
Pepsi, Apple or Android, liberal 
or conservative. But, Goddard 

asks, do any of these choices really 
matter? Does the outcome truly 
differ, or is the appearance of 
choice merely a tool with which 
to placate the everyman in a world 
that is moving increasingly out of 
his control? The El Royale’s entire 
business model is based on selling 
guests the (meaningless) choice 
between a room in Nev. and a 
room in Calif. This is where “Bad 
Times” truly separates itself from 
the pack in terms of “homage” 
films; 
Goddard 
writes 
with 
purpose and intent. The film is all 
about illusory facades — choice 
where there is no choice, kindness 
where there is hatred. It’s for this 
reason that the gaudy retrofuturist 
stylings 
of 
the 
’50s 
should 
serve as the perfect aesthetic 
backdrop for the film; beneath 
the mask of post-war American 
prosperity and optimism lay a 
nation plagued with xenophobia, 
nationalism and racial unrest. 
Behind 
Dwight 
Eisenhower’s 
clean-cut military polish lay a 
government committing human-
rights atrocities around the globe. 
The world of “Bad Times” exists 
to serve its story and its message, 
not the other way around. 
Genre films are often dismissed 
by critics and cinephiles to the 
point where the label has become 
almost condescending. With “Bad 
Times at the El Royale,” Drew 
Goddard proves that production 
value, creative ingenuity and 
attention to detail need not be 
reserved for the latest Oscar-
winning drama from Tom Hanks 
and company. The film deserves 
to be discussed as more than just 
a genre-homage, and if this film 
doesn’t generate any buzz come 
awards season, it will have been 
a criminal injustice. A complete 
thrill-ride from start to finish with 
a thought-provoking message to 
boot, “Bad Times at the El Royale” 
is undoubtedly one of 2018’s best 
releases.

“Bad Times at 
the El Royale”

20th Century Fox

Goodrich Quality 16

There’s a music venue about 
15 minutes away from my home 
called Ravinia Festival. It’s a 
beautiful outdoor space tailor-
made for an ideal summer 
evening sitting on an expansive 
lawn listening to the BoDeans or 
assorted almost-corpses from The 
Beach Boys. Naturally my family 
buys a cheese plate or two, packs 
about 40 blankets and candles and 
heads to Ravinia for a night every 
July.
When I think of these nights, I 
think of cargo shorts. I don’t know 
why. It could be that most of my 
memories from Ravinia seem to be 
lodged firmly between 2004 and 
2007. It might be that most of the 
old people I was with at Ravinia 
were, in fact, rocking cargo shorts. 
More likely, in recounting some of 
my earliest cultural immersions of 
any form, I’ve confounded a North 
suburban Chicago music venue, a 
timeless look and those above me 
who introduced me to music.
That’s how we end up here: at 
parents, and music. Because both, 
together, mean a lot to many.
Formative listening is one of 
my favorite things. I realize it 
might be tender or sensitive for 
some folks, but I also think it’s 
very healthy for the soul — even 
to just think about. It’s something 
I do often, and it’s something I 
think you should do too: Listen to 
your mom’s music every once in a 
while.

I’m not really sure what that 
means either, but for the purposes 
of this exploration, allow me to 
walk you through my mother’s 
music.
Ever 
heard 
of 
Joan 
Armatrading? I hadn’t either, 
until she soundtracked my mom’s 
weekly Mah Jongg games in our 
kitchen during my elementary 
years. I don’t particularly enjoy 
Joan Armatrading’s music, but 
I enjoy hearing about my mom’s 
Joan Armatrading tradition: Each 
year, when Armatrading plays 
Chicago, she heads to the City 
Winery (apparently a real place 
where things happen) with the 
same friend (who may or may not 
exist) who has been accompanying 
her to Armatrading concerts for 
years. I really like the sentiment 
and story. Joan Armatrading 
is, consequently, a good dose of 
medicine.
More 
digestible? 
Mary 
J. 
Blige. There’s a song she sings 
— it’s called “Just Fine” — that’s 
impossible, physically, to resist 
tapping your foot to, and before 
you know it, you’re dancing at 
5:00 p.m. on a Friday again, 
because Shabbat is imminent 
and the table needs to be set up 
before the grandparents arrive. 
That vignette might have been 
me exclusive. But that’s what my 
mom listens to, so I listen too.
There comes a point in the road 
— not a metaphorical road, a real 
road — where you need to break 
it down. If you’re my mom, this 
is most of the time. If you’re me, 

this is rare. If you’re human, you 
listen to Valee’s “Womp Womp,” a 
new favorite for my mother. When 
drives to the grocery store become 
parties 
and 
drivers 
become 
dance circle commandeers, this 
is where we turn. It’s where my 
mom turns, at least, and for that 
I am thankful. It’s fun to womp 
womp. If you’re buying the womp, 
don’t stress over its source. Your 
dad’s music? Sure. Siblings, aunts, 
uncles, grandparents too. If your 
best friend has stuff you like, go 
for it.
Much of this column has been 
thematically 
centered 
around 
different types of proverbial 
“resets.” I haven’t done this on 
purpose, but the trend also kind 
of makes sense. As I’m nearing the 
end of my writing process for this 
piece, my mind is consumed by 
worry about my lack of ideas for 
future columns. I’m also thinking 
about which frozen Trader Joe’s 
meal I will heat up for dinner, 
why I will choose taquitos for 
the second night in a row and 
how I’d like to stay away from a 
column with a “how much other 
work I need to do” cliché. But now 
there’s way too much meta going 
on, which is probably even worse. 
Ultimately this column will need 
to end with jumbled thoughts 
before opening Spotify to propel 
me through my next chunk of 
work. I have the Sunday Scaries, 
I’d like a semblance of familiarity 
amidst other general chaos and 
I need an excuse to listen to Van 
Morrison.

Michigan wraps up road-trip with weekend split

The 
No. 
13 
Michigan 
women’s volleyball team hit 
the road to take on two Big 
Ten foes this past weekend. 
The Wolverines (18-3 overall, 
7-3 Big Ten) looked to pull 
off an upset in Champaign on 
Friday night while battling 
No. 7 Illinois (18-3, 7-3) in 
a thrilling match that went 
down to the wire.
When 
the 
dust 
settled, 
Michigan fell to the Fighting 
Illini, 22-25, 26-24, 24-26, 
25-23, 13-15 despite arguably 
the 
Wolverines’ 
finest 
defensive 
showing 
of 
the 
season. Senior libero Jenna 
Lerg, senior outside hitter 
Carly Skjodt and sophomore 
defensive specialist Natalie 
Smith all recorded double-
digit digs — finishing with 
26, 17 and 16, respectively. 
Ultimately, 
attack 
errors 
dashed Michigan’s hopes of 
taking down Illinois.
In addition to her season-
high 17 digs in the back row, 
Skjodt led all players with 
25 kills on offense while 
only committing five errors. 
The match marked Skjodt’s 
fifth double-double of her 
magical senior campaign to 
this point. On a night when 
Michigan struggled to gain 
any momentum on offense 
— yielding just a .185 attack 
percentage for the match as 
a team — it turned to Skjodt 
when she was needed most, 
resulting in a season-high 76 
attempts for the Wolverines’ 
most powerful pin attacker.
Knotted at one set apiece, 
Michigan and Illinois found 
themselves 
deadlocked 
at 
the back end of an intense 
third set with the scoreboard 
in Huff Hall reading 24-24. 

In front of a crowd of 2,542, 
the Fighting Illini used their 
height 
and 
experience 
to 
stave off the Wolverines when 
it mattered most. In the final 
two points of the set, Illinois 
looked to their two tallest 
seniors 
— 
6-foot-2 
setter 
Jordyn Poulter and 6-foot-3 
middle blocker Ali Bastianelli 
— to secure a pair of crucial 
kills and close out the set. 
After that, the Fighting Illini 
worked around a handful of 
hiccups in the fourth set to 
capture a 15-13 win in the 
match’s decisive fifth set.
“Illinois is a really good 
team 
— 
it 
would’ve 
been 
a 
great 
win 
for 
us,” 
said 
Michigan coach 
Mark 
Rosen. 
“Our kids played 
well, and we had 
a 
really 
good 
chance 
in 
set 
three, 
but 
we 
couldn’t 
quite 
pull it out.”
Following 
the 
narrow 
loss, 
Michigan 
made 
the 
trip to Evanston to take on 
Northwestern 
(11-11, 
1-9) 
less than 24 hours later. 
With little time to digest the 
previous 
night’s 
outcome, 
the 
Wolverines 
put 
their 
resiliency on full display from 
the start. Michigan jumped 
out to a 9-3 lead — an opening 
run that set the tone for the 
Wolverines’ eventual 25-17, 
25-23, 
25-14 
sweep. 
After 
splitting their two matches 
over 
the 
weekend, 
the 
Wolverines are currently tied 
for third place in the Big Ten 
standings.
Freshman 
outside 
hitter 
Paige Jones led all players 
with 12 kills against the 
Wildcats 
while 
registering 

an impressive .450 attack 
percentage — the highest clip 
against a Big Ten opponent 
of her young career. Jones’ 
stat line marked a major 
improvement 
from 
the 
previous 
night, 
when 
she 
committed nine errors on 32 
swings against Illinois.
“Paige is a young player 
who’s continuing to learn and 
figure out what it takes to be 
successful day in and day out 
at this level,” Rosen said. “She 
struggled 
(against 
Illinois) 
last night, but I thought her 
rebound tonight was really 
good. You really have to like 
that in a player 
— 
everyone’s 
going to have 
an 
off 
night 
where 
they 
struggle a bit, 
so it becomes a 
matter of how 
they respond. I 
thought Paige 
responded 
really well in 
practice 
this 
morning and then in the game 
this evening for sure.”
Meanwhile, the Wildcats 
held Skjodt, Michigan’s most 
dangerous offensive weapon, 
in check throughout most of 
the match — limiting her to 
just eight kills and forcing her 
into five errors.
“We kind of expected that 
(from Skjodt) a bit because 
she took so many swings last 
night,” Rosen said. “She was 
feeling that soreness a little 
bit today so she was trying 
to be a smart, shotty player 
tonight. For her, she can get 
away with that because she 
knows when she needs to dial 
it up. She had a couple huge 
kills at the end of the second 
set when it was pretty tight; 
she knew she had to take a 

couple big swings.”
On the defensive end, the 
Wolverines’ weekend at the 
net was marked by two huge 
performances by a pair of 
young 
middle 
blockers 
— 
sophomore 
Kiara 
Shannon 
recorded seven blocks against 
the Fighting Illini on Friday 
and 
freshman 
Kayla 
Bair 
notched six of her own against 
the Wildcats on Saturday.
“They’re really getting to 
a high level,” Rosen said of 
Shannon and Bair. “One’s 
a 
freshman 
and 
one’s 
a 
sophomore so we know we’re 
going to have to work through 
that youth and watch them 
continue to develop, but I 
thought they took a really big 
step this past week. Between 
last night and tonight, but 
have done a really good job 
making an impact on the 
match — they did a great job.”
After 
setting 
Skjodt 
a 
staggering 
76 
times 
on 
Friday night, one of the most 
noticeable 
adjustments 
in 
Michigan’s 
approach 
was 
its balanced attack during 
Saturday’s 
match. 
Senior 
setter 
MacKenzie 
Welsh 
paced the offense with 31 
assists, and three Wolverines 
saw at least 15 attack attempts 
in the team’s bounce-back 
effort. Welsh’s decision to 
spread the ball around made 
her very effective at the helm 
of Michigan’s offense while 
keeping 
Northwestern’s 
defense uncertain throughout 
the match.
“Mack was really good last 
night and then really good 
again tonight,” said Rosen. 
“She did a great job with 
her selection, her decision-
making, and her adjustments 
when she got a feel for the 
defense. She’s running a very 
efficient offense right now.”

Sophomore midfielder Nicki Hernandez scored a goal in Michigan’s win.

‘M’ beat MSU, 2-0, in 
regular season finale

Just 
forty 
seconds 
into 
Sunday’s game at U-M Soccer 
Stadium, 
the 
ball 
already 
found the back of the net.
After starting strong with 
an early goal, the Michigan 
women’s soccer team (5-5-1 
Big Ten, 9-8-1 overall) beat 
Michigan State (0-8-2, 5-9-3), 
2-0, ending the team’s regular 
season with a win on Senior 
Night.
The Wolverines took their 
early lead off a pass from 
sophomore midfielder Sarah 
Stratigakis 
to 
sophomore 
midfielder Nicki Hernandez 
in 
the 
penalty 
box. 
Hernandez 
hit 
a 
low 
shot 
to 
the 
bottom 
right 
corner of the 
net, relieving 
pressure 
on 
Michigan 
from the start 
as fans were 
still adjusting 
blankets, just settling in to 
pay attention to the game.
“Getting one early was our 
mission 
today,” 
Stratigakis 
said. “Our energy was up and I 
think overall we were playing 
really well together and as a 
team.”
The Wolverines kept up 
the momentum throughout 
the first half, winning balls 
out of the air and controlling 
possession 
with 
multiple 
chances 
in 
the 
Spartans’ 
box. 
Toward 
the 
end 
of 
the half, though, Michigan 
State increased pressure on 
Michigan’s back line, with one 
shot hitting the crossbar and 
almost tying the game. But the 
Wolverines held the shutout 
with key saves by sophomore 
goalkeeper Hillary Beall. 
“We 
realized 
they 
had 
some 
momentum, 
but 
we 
just got together and talked 

about what we needed to do 
as a team, and we continued 
to high press them and just 
be more greedy out there,” 
Stratigakis said. “Once our 
talent came out, we just 
outmatched them.”
With a 1-0 lead going into the 
second half, Michigan started 
converting its possession into 
chances more readily, with 
shots on goal from Stratigakis, 
senior 
forward 
Reilly 
Martin, freshman midfielder 
Meredith 
Haakenson 
and 
redshirt 
junior 
midfielder 
Katie Foug.
In 
the 
73rd 
minute, 
sophomore forward Emma 
Cooper finally made it 2-0 
when a corner 
kick 
by 
Foug 
was tapped by 
Stratigakis 
to 
Cooper 
who 
shot from the 
right side of the 
box.
After the goal, 
the Wolverines 
kept 
up 
their 
speed 
of 
play 
and 
continued 
to generate chances in the 
final minutes, including a 
through ball to Foug resulting 
in an open net. But the score 
remained 2-0 by the end of 
the game despite Michigan’s 
opportunities in the penalty 
box.
The win, with a finish as 
strong as its start, earned the 
Wolverines a place in the Big 
Ten 
tournament 
beginning 
Oct. 28. Michigan will secure 
either a seven or eight seed 
depending on the outcome 
of Michigan State’s game at 
Nebraska on Wednesday.
“At this point, it’s just 
about showing up and doing 
what we’ve been working 
on every day in training and 
what we’ve learned in every 
game,” said Michigan coach 
Jennifer Klein. “It was a great 
performance by the team, and 
I’m very happy with them.”

Harbaugh doubles down about pre-game antics

The 
controversy 
around 
Saturday’s pre-game rituals didn’t 
end before the game Saturday. Nor 
did it end after. 
Apparently, it’s still not over.
Monday 
afternoon, 
during 
his 
weekly 
media 
availability, 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
doubled down on his claim that 
Michigan State and its head coach 
Mark Dantonio orchestrated the 
events that transpired.
“That that was bush league,” 
Harbaugh said, repeating a phrase 
he used after the game. “That 
it has all the evidence of being 
orchestrated.”
What were those events, exactly? 
Depends who you ask.
It centers around the Spartans’ 
pre-game walk, a tradition in the 
program of walking the length 
of the field with arms linked. 
Harbaugh says Michigan requested 
information ahead of time about the 
timing of that walk, in order to stay 
off the field until it was over.
According to him, the response 
was vague.
“We contacted them because 
they send us a book, pregame 
operations, that was the most 
detailed, finest I’ve ever seen,” 
Harbaugh said. “Has everything in 
it, in writing. But (the walk) is not (in 
it) — so we called them and asked, 
‘What time are you guys doing your 
walk? Because we don’t want to put 
our players out to warmup until 
after you guys do your traditional 
walk.”
First, Harbaugh said, they were 
told it would be at 9:45. Then they 
were told 9:55. Then, according 
to 
Harbaugh, 
Michigan 
State 
responded that it might not even 
happen.
“That walk happened another 10 
minutes after that,” Harbaugh said, 
“and at no point was there any kind 
of heads up or, ‘Hey, could you guys 
please leave the field?”
Wolverines players remained 
on the field warming up as the 
Michigan 
State 
players 
lined 
up to do the walk shortly after 

10am. That’s when the altercation 
transpired, with fifth-year senior 
defensive 
lineman 
Lawrence 
Marshall getting “clotheslined” 
and junior cornerback Lavert Hill 
getting his headphones ripped off 
his head, according to Michigan.
This led to junior linebacker 
Devin Bush scraping up the 
Spartans’ midfield logo with his 
cleats before the game, and the 
Wolverines proceeding to celebrate 
on the logo after the 21-7 win.
Michigan State players claimed 
the timing of the walk was ordinary 
practice, that no team had ever 
remained on the field while the 
Spartans were walking. Dantonio 
addressed the ordeal at a press 
conference Sunday. His comments 
hinted at a desire to move forward.
“The whole thing to me was 
sort of juvenile,” Dantonio told 
reporters. “Things are going to 
happen in rivalry games. So, I stand 
by what I said yesterday.”
Harbaugh clearly didn’t take 
kindly to that.
“Using the word ‘juvenile,’ I 
think that’s kind of brushing it 
under the carpet. Their strength 
coaches were out there leading it. 
Their assistant coaches were out 
there. Coach Dantonio was right 

behind,” Harbaugh said. “That had 
all the ear-markings and evidence 
of an orchestrated, storm-trooper 
march.”
After the game on Saturday, 
shortly after Harbaugh said the 
move was “bush league,” Dantonio 
denied the claim.
“That’s B.S.”
Repeat?
“You heard me. That’s B.S.”
Monday, 
Harbaugh 
clapped 
back.
“As I said, it’s the opposite of 
B.S. Coach (Dantonio) said it was 
B.S., that’s not B.S., that’s fact,” 
Harbaugh said. … “I’ll go one step 
further and use Coach Dantonio’s 
words from a few years back: ‘It’s 
not a product of a team, but their 
program.’ ”
Harbaugh called on the athletic 
directors to discuss the incident, 
saying, “I think that’s something 
(Michigan 
Athletic 
Director) 
Warde (Manuel) will address.”
Late Monday evening, Michigan 
State issued a statement once again 
disputing Harbaugh’s accusation. It 
reads as follows:
“Regarding 
last 
Saturday’s 
pregame timeline, both teams were 
distributed pregame timing sheets 
and were in communication earlier 

in the week about Michigan State’s 
pregame 
tradition 
of 
walking 
the field upon arrival to Spartan 
Stadium. There has never been an 
on-field issue with this tradition in 
the 12 years under head coach Mark 
Dantonio. The timing of Saturday’s 
pregame tradition did not change 
from previous games, nor did the 
communication change between 
both schools. MSU was scheduled to 
leave the Kellogg Center for its walk 
to the stadium at 9:45 a.m. and left at 
9:47 a.m. The team was scheduled 
to arrive at Spartan Stadium at 
approximately 10 a.m. and walked 
the field at approximately 10:02 
a.m. As a courtesy, Michigan was 
granted field access before MSU’s 
arrival with the understanding 
from both sides that the U of M 
student-athletes would leave the 
field during this tradition. Michigan 
was on the field prior to 10 a.m. as 
previously agreed upon, but when 
multiple MSU staff members asked 
both U of M student-athletes and 
staff members to please move off 
the field for the pregame field walk, 
this did not occur.”
On a related note, Michigan and 
Michigan State square off again in 
390 days. Might want to mark that 
one on your calendar.

Offensive lineman set to 
transfer from Michigan

James Hudson is leaving 
the Michigan football team, 
U-M spokesperson Dave Ablauf 
confirmed to multiple sources 
on Monday night. The redshirt 
freshman offensive tackle saw 
action in three games this 
season.
After 
switching 
from 
defensive line, Hudson seemed 
like a potential replacement 
for fifth-year senior Juwann 
Bushell-Beatty as a starter 
along the Wolverines’ offensive 
line in 2019. But when Bushell-
Beatty left Saturday’s game 
against Michigan State with 
a left leg injury, sophomore 
Andrew Stueber — not Hudson 
— substituted in.
Harbaugh, during his weekly 
press conference, explained his 
decision Monday.
“(Stueber) has done a good 
job,” Harbaugh said. “He’s 
progressing well. He went a 
little bit ahead (on the depth 
chart). James had dislocated a 
finger in a previous ball game, 
Andrew had more reps and 
went ahead on the depth chart 
this week.”
Hudson is the Wolverines’ 
second 
departure 
of 
the 

past week. Last Wednesday, 
redshirt freshman linebacker 
Drew Singleton announced his 
intentions to transfer, joining 
defensive 
lineman 
Deron 
Irving-Bey, tight end Tyrone 
Wheatley 
Jr. 
and 
receiver 
Eddie McDoom as previous 
exits in 2018.
The Toledo, Ohio, native 
was a heavily-hyped prospect 
“in the ballpark” of a starting 
role according to Harbaugh. 
Offensive 
line 
coach 
Ed 
Warriner 
echoed 
Hudson’s 
improvement on Sept. 12.
“His 
growth 
over 
the 
summer and then this fall has 
been tremendous,” Warriner 
said. “He’s fully invested now 
as an offensive lineman. In 
the spring he was putting a 
toe in the water to see what 
he thought. He gave us a good 
effort and showed some talent, 
but there were times it was 
frustrating for him because it 
was just so new. To go against 
our defensive ends every day, 
it’s 
challenging. 
He’s 
way 
beyond 
that. 
He’s 
gained 
confidence in himself and his 
ability to do the job, knowing 
what to do when he’s out there.”
Hudson 
will 
have 
three 
years of eligibility remaining 
once he chooses a new school.

Poole adapting to fill Abdur-Rahkman’s role

Spend any time with sophomore 
guard 
Jordan 
Poole 
and 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman 
and the difference between the two 
personalities is instantly apparent.
Abdur-Rahkman, now graduated 
and playing in the NBA’s G League, 
was perpetually calm and collected. 
On the other end of the spectrum, 
Poole is among the most colorful 
players in college basketball. Even 
before his now-iconic buzzer beater 
against Houston in the NCAA 
tournament, he had become a cult 
figure 
among 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball fans despite averaging 
just 12.5 minutes per game in his 
freshman season.
While they are polar opposites 
off the court, Poole now has to step 
into Abdur-Rahkman’s role as the 
Wolverines’ starting shooting guard.
“Jordan has to have a bigger role 
now,” said assistant coach DeAndre 
Haynes on Monday. “And I think he’s 
accepted that role. And we told him 
last year, losing Muhammad, we’re 
gonna have to dial you up a little bit 

more.”
After a year of working with Poole, 
Michigan’s coaching staff knows 
that he will never replicate Abdur-
Rahkman’s composure. But on the 
court, they need him to replace 
Abdur-Rahkman’s 
trademark 
reliability.
Poole’s primary role in the 
Wolverines’ offense will be as its 
go-to three-point shooter after they 
lost their top three deep-ball threats 
from last season.
Three-point shooting, though, 
has never been a challenge for Poole. 
Coach John Beilein estimates that 
he has done 30 to 40 shooting tests 
in preseason without failing a single 
one.
“For the most part, he’s really had 
this good feel for, ‘what’s a good shot 
for me and what’s a good play for me?’ 
” Beilein said. “ ‘I’m not gonna turn 
the ball over, I’m gonna take a quality 
shot.’ ”
Where Poole will have to adapt to 
his new role is by limiting turnovers. 
That — along with defense — was 
the main issue that kept him off the 
floor for large swaths of his freshman 
season. He posted 25 turnovers to 

just 20 assists, a stark contrast to 
Abdur-Rahkman’s 132-to-30 assist-
to-turnover ratio.
Since Michigan’s August trip to 
Spain, though, Poole has developed 
a newfound ability to protect the ball. 
In the Wolverines’ 17 practices thus 
far, he and junior point guard Zavier 
Simpson have combined for the same 
assist-to-turnover ratio as Simpson 
and Abdur-Rahkman did last season.
“I think he learned a lot from 
Muhammad,” Beilein said. “You 
don’t need to be all out there like 
that to be really good, you just need 
to have substance to your game. The 
assist-to-turnover ratio is really the 
biggest thing.”
Poole’s defensive progress has 
also bolstered the coaching staff’s 
confidence in him. Simpson and 
redshirt junior Charles Matthews 
took the accolades on that end of the 
floor, but Abdur-Rahkman was the 
same reliable presence defensively as 
he was on offense.
While Beilein cites Poole’s lack 
of turnovers as most significant 
improvement, Haynes calls his 
defense “the biggest thing” he’s 
changed over the offseason.

“These last couple practices, he’s 
been terrific on the floor defensively,” 
Haynes said. “Cause we told him last 
year, ‘Man, you gotta play both ends 
of the floor.’ And now, he’s starting to 
do it, and he’s starting to realize that 
‘Hey, if I do these things, I can stay on 
the floor but I can also help my team 
win.’
“And I think Muhammad is 
another guy that he shows you what 
it took, and I think (Poole is) doing it 
as well, he’s starting to step up and 
say, ‘I gotta be a better defender this 
week.’ ”
Unlike Abdur-Rahkman, Poole 
will never be muted in his on-court 
emotion, nor will he slip under the 
radar as a hidden star. But after a year 
of learning from Abdur-Rahkman, 
he is prepared to fill his void on 
the court. That, coupled with his 
signature confidence, is exactly what 
the Wolverines need.
“I always feel like I was built 
for this stage,” Poole said. “… Me 
and (Abdur-Rahkman) are two 
completely different players, but 
coach 
(Beilein) 
wouldn’t 
have 
recruited me if he didn’t have faith in 
me to step into that role.”

Boka filling leadership 
role for the Wolverines

When a team has just three 
seniors and ten freshmen, such as 
the No. 12 Michigan hockey team, 
each senior has to step up and 
take on a solid leadership role.
But that isn’t an issue for senior 
defenseman Nick Boka, who has 
been acting as a leader since he 
was a junior.
“I had comments last year, 
even as a junior, about him 
reaching out,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. “I think he’s 
got a nice way about him with the 
players away from the rink, too, 
especially with the young guys. 
I think that’s important, to make 
them feel included.”
Boka downplays his role with 
the Wolverines’ freshmen, but 
it’s clear that helping out the 
younger players is something 
that’s important to him. His 
freshman 
year, 
the 
2015-16 
season, Michigan also had just 
three seniors on the team — 
forwards Justin Selman and 
Cristoval Nieves and goaltender 
Steve Racine. 
The three made an impression 
on a young Boka, and he tries to 
follow their example today.
“I remember coming in as a 
freshman, we only had three 
seniors that year, and just how 
amazing those guys were to us 
and all the freshmen,” Boka said. 
“The way they played, they left it 
all out there and I think that, for 
me, is definitely something I try 
to do.”
Perhaps correlated with Boka’s 
leadership role is a newfound 
maturity on the ice. Controlling 
his emotions has always been 
an issue, but it’s something he’s 
started to take more seriously in 
the latter half of his career as a 
Wolverine.
After an incident in January, 
when he yelled a curse word so 
loudly that it reverberated inside 
Notre Dame’s Compton Family 
Ice Arena, Boka has appeared to 
have much better control over 
his mental game. He’s still an 
aggressive, 
emotional 
player, 

but it doesn’t go to extremes 
anymore.
“We need Nick on the ice,” 
Pearson said. “He’s more valuable 
to us on the ice than in the penalty 
box. … We told him, ‘Sometimes, 
it’s tougher to take a bad hit and 
not retaliate,’ and I think that’s 
what he’s done this year. He’s 
shown he can do that.”
Working 
on 
your 
mental 
toughness and emotional control 
isn’t easy, especially for a player 
like Boka. But with the help of 
famed motivational speaker and 
life coach Greg Harden — who 
has worked with players like 
Tom Brady — Boka is figuring out 
how to keep his emotions from 
affecting his play.
“I 
can’t 
thank 
(Harden) 
enough for what he’s done for 
me,” Boka said. “I continue to 
go see him probably every other 
week and just talk. Talk about 
life. He’s helped me a ton.” 
And it seems that the work on 
his mental game is paying off. 
Boka has played some of his best 
hockey at Michigan since that 
game against the Fighting Irish 
in January.
The improvement that Pearson 
saw in the second half of last 
season has carried through the 
offseason and into the beginning 
of this season, with Boka out to 
one of the best starts of his career 
after notching two assists in 
three games.
Boka still prides himself on 
being a shutdown blueliner first 
and sees any offensive success 
he has as a bonus. His on-ice role 
has expanded this year, with his 
skating ability allowing him to 
earn playing time on the power 
play.
Pearson says he can play in any 
situation, but it seems that his 
biggest role expansion has come 
off the ice — not on it.
“I think (being one of three 
seniors) is a huge responsibility,” 
Boka said. “I think little things, 
giving guys rides or hanging 
out away from the rink, I think 
all that goes a long way. That’s 
something I took away from those 
three seniors my freshman year.”
