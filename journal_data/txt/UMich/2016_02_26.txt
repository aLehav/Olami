Techlab to allow 

outside researchers 

to contribute to 

driverless car tech.

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily News Editor

The University of Michigan 

launched the pilot of TechLab at 
Mcity, a program for transpor-
tation startups to partner with 
researchers at the automated 
vehicle testing site, Thursday.

TechLab is meant to bring 

driverless innovation closer to 
consumer markets by provid-
ing companies working with 
transportation technology with 
access to Mcity’s nationally 
recognized research facilities, 
according to a press release.

“By creating a structure that 

allows startup companies from 
around the globe to access top-
flight talent and resources that 
would otherwise be unavailable 
to them, we believe we have 

hit upon a model that will cre-
ate a winning opportunity for 
all involved,” Thomas Frank, 
executive director of the Col-
lege of Engineering’s Center 
for Entrepreneurship, said in a 
press release.

Frank was not immediately 

available for comment Thurs-
day evening.

Mcity launched in July 2015 

as the world’s first controlled 
vehicle test site for research-
ing automated vehicle technol-
ogy and developing driverless 
cars ready for the mass market. 
Housed on North Campus, it 
was created by the University’s 
Mobility Transformation Cen-
ter and the State of Michigan 
Department of Transportation.

Zendrive, created by former 

employees at Google and Face-
book, is the first startup par-
ticipating in TechLab. Zendrive 
uses mobile sensor technol-
ogy to measure driver safety in 
actions like acceleration, break-
ing, swerving and phone use.

Student association 
hosts series of events 
to promote discussion

By SOPHIE SHERRY

Daily Staff Reporter

The Muslim Students’ Asso-

ciation hosted an event Thursday 
aimed at demonstrating solidarity 
with Black Lives Matter, an activ-
ist movement advocating for the 

freedom and liberty of people in 
the Black community.

LSA senior Sarah Khan, a pan-

elist and MSA’s social justice and 
activism director, said the goal of 
the event was to combat instances 
of racism that are found in a vari-
ety of communities and expressed 
by a wide range of identities. 
Khan is a managing editor for The 
Michigan Daily’s Michigan In 
Color section.

“As a non-Black person of color, 

my hope for this event is to combat 

the anti-Black racism that is pres-
ent in my own community,” Khan 
said. “I hope that this event will 
give us the foundation to under-
stand why the Muslim community 
must stand in solidarity with the 
Black community. This is the MSA 
beginning to take accountability.”

Panelist Dawud Walid, execu-

tive director of the Michigan 
chapter of the Council on Ameri-
can-Islamic Relations, began the 
discussion by asking the audience 
to take a different approach to 

identity.

“The term ‘solidarity’ is to me 

trying to find the common points 
and stand with someone who is 
maybe outside of yourself,” Walid 
said. “I’d like for us to try and 
reframe this and look at this as us 
actually being integrally connect-
ed and part of each other.”

LSA senior Arnold Reed, an 

adviser to the Black Student 
Union, was also on the panel. 
Reed said BSU was the first place

Residents 

concerned about 
potential pollution 
from new structure

By LYDIA BARRY

Daily Staff Reporter

University of Michigan offi-

cials and Ann Arbor residents 
met Thursday evening to dis-
cuss the University’s proposed 
Transportation Operations and 
Maintenance Center, slated to 
be built on Green Road between 
Hubbard Road and Baxter Road.

The meeting yielded a large 

turnout of residents hoping to 
gain a deeper understanding 
of the potential issues with the 
new center, which will serve as a 
bus depot where North Campus 
buses will be stored and receive 
maintenance.

At the meeting, residents 

expressed several main areas of 

concern, including environmen-
tal impact on the surrounding 
area and potential traffic issues. 
The local neighborhood asso-
ciation has created a site with 
information on the proposed 
facility. Ann Arbor resident 
Dan Beard told officials that he 
thought the University hadn’t 
not fully consider the conse-
quences of its actions.

“It’s really disturbing that the 

University is consolidating its 
pollution output so close to low-
income housing,” Beard said.

University 
Planner 
Susan 

Gott said the center’s location 
was determined to be the most 
logical proposal because of an 
increased number of people rid-
ing University buses and subse-
quent need for a larger vehicle 
storage facility.

“The existing facility … is not 

meeting the current operational 
needs and therefore a new facil-
ity will incorporate space that 
better incorporates better buses 
than could fit into the original 

facility,” Gott said. “The reason 
this location is selected is to try 
to bring the beginning trips to 
where the early morning and 
evening demand is. There is an 
efficiency for relocating onto 
North Campus.”

During the meeting, City 

Councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm 

(D-Ward 2) also spoke out 
against the proposal. She said 
she thought there was another 
option the University could uti-
lize to increase bus count with-
out 
affecting 
neighborhoods 

— the city’s Wheeler Center, a 
garage which she said is cur-
rently under capacity.

“We have a state-of-the-art 

garage facility, the Wheeler 
Center,” Lumm said. “What the 
city could do for the Univer-
sity is to offer an incredible col-
laboration opportunity. All of 
our vehicles are maintained at 
the Wheeler Center. It sounds 
like an excellent collaboration 
opportunity.”

In response to concerns, Uni-

Eight individuals 

have officially 
declared their 
intentions to run

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily News Editor

As the deadline for filing 

petitions 
approaches, 
eight 

contenders 
have 
officially 

stepped forward in the 2016 
election for Ann Arbor City 
Council.

Five out of the 10 seats on 

Council are open in Novem-
ber’s election, along with the 
position of mayor. Five of 
the six current office holders 
— Kirk Westphal (D–Ward 
2), Julie Grand (D–Ward 3), 
ChuckWarpehoski 
(D–Ward 

5), Graydon Krapohl (D–Ward 
4) and Mayor Christopher 
Taylor — are running for re-
election thus far.

To vote in the upcoming 

City Council elections, indi-
viduals must be both a regis-
tered voter in Ann Arbor as 
well as a resident of the can-
didate’s ward. In the past, stu-
dents have noted it is difficult 
for them to coalesce around 
one candidate because of the 
way the wards are drawn.

“So where the campus is 

located touches all five wards. 
Every address in the city 
including the dormitories is 
assigned — they’re on the map

From THE MICHIGAN DAILY

Anyone who has taken a Blue 

Bus can attest to its tendency 
to be inefficient and consis-
tently 
overcrowded. 
These 

issues serve to create a siz-
able gap between Central and 
North Campus: Students who 
live on Central are disincentiv-
ized from enjoying the natural 
beauty and arts on North, while 
students who must travel from 
North to Central are alienated 
from much of University life. 
Intercampus transportation is 
very clearly an issue that needs 
to be solved.

Fortunately, the University 

of Michigan and the city of 
Ann Arbor have begun moving 
forward with plans to build a 
light rail, named the Ann Arbor 
Connector. The first part of the 
project that would ultimately 
run throughout the city of Ann 
Arbor is the branch of the train 
that would unite North and 
Central Campus. Paid for by 
the University, the city of Ann 
Arbor, and most likely with 
funding from federal, state 
and public and private part-
nerships, the light rail would 
be expensive in the short run, 
but beneficial to students in 
the long run. This light rail 
system would improve student 
life in myriad ways, providing a 
quicker, safer, more accessible 
way to move between our cam-
puses. A light rail system would 
be more reliable than the cur-
rent busing system because it 
would move at the same rate no 

matter the level of car traffic. 
What’s more, students could 
get down to Central Campus 
faster during game days and 
event days when the roads are 
teeming with pedestrians and 
parents. Additionally, because 
light rails are automated, they 
could run later and longer than 
the buses we have now.

This 
project 
would 
not 

only benefit students in their 
everyday lives, but it would 
also prove advantageous for 
the University and the city of 
Ann Arbor. It would reduce 
the number of cars on the 
road, alleviating the extremely 
heavy traffic Ann Arbor faces 
on a daily basis. Light rail has 
also been proven safer than 
cars.

The city of Ann Arbor would 

also benefit because this proj-
ect would reduce the city’s 
carbon footprint. More than 
46,000 people commute to 
the city each day, and with a 
light rail, commuters would 
be able to park their cars near 
a train stop and then take the 
monorail to their workplace, 
leveraging the fact that rail 
systems are four times more 
efficient than cars. This would 
take cars off the road — making 
them safer — and save time for 
commuters and students who 
need to drive or take the bus. 
The light rail is planned to be 
powered entirely by renewable 
resources, which would fur-
ther reduce our emissions.

In the long run, the light 

rail would save the Univer-

Student org holds 
event for National 
Eating Disorder 
Awareness week

By NEIL SCHWARTZ

For the Daily

The Body Peace Corps held 

a group presentation and dis-
cussion in the Michigan Union 
Thursday evening to discuss the 
positives and negatives of body 
image associated with eating 
disorders.

“Riots Not Diets” was one 

part of a week-long event, held in 
conjunction with Active Minds 
and the University of Michigan’s 
Counseling 
and 
Psychologi-

cal Services for Eating Disorder 
Awareness Week. The series of 
events focused on promoting pos-
itive body image through online 
articles, poster making, sharing 
experiences about eating dis-
order recovery, clothing drives, 
events and fundraisers. 

Throughout the presentation, 

event coordinators Traci Ayub, a 
first-year master’s student at the 

School of Public Health, and LSA 
senior Rachael Ankley encour-
aged the audience to talk about 
current issues society is facing 
regarding the portrayal of body 
image and eating disorders.

One student commented on 

the large volume of body image 
stories focused around adoles-
cent girls and younger women 
and the lack of stories about 
the transition to adulthood and 
beyond, where she said these 
issues remain a major concern. 
Another 
student 
highlighted 

the sensationalized way losing 
weight is treated, which they said 
leaves out the emotional struggle 
that those affected by eating dis-
orders might go through.

Ayub and Ankley emphasized 

those issues in their presenta-
tion, along with several other 
topics, such as the prevalence 
eating disorders in marginalized 
social and ethnic groups. In par-
ticular, Ayub discussed the feel-
ing of being alone that she said 
members of this group may expe-
rience, along with fears about 
being accepted by their peers.

“We started mentioning sto-

ries about men, stories about 
people of color, stories about 

those in the LGBT community... 
anything that wasn’t that typical 
story about the white woman,” 
Ayub said. “That is an important 
story, but it is being told already. 
It’s just that there are not a lot of 
identities talked about in terms of 
eating disorders.”

The 
presentation 
also 

explained 
several 
underly-

ing concerns in the treatment 
of eating disorders. One of the 
most common ways individuals 
with eating disorders suffer in 
everyday life, they said, is from 
comments of others about their 
image.

“You can’t tell if somebody is 

healthy looking at them,” Ayub 
said. “And a lot of times, we try to 
police people of a certain weight. 
You’re not really helping them. 
They are aware of their health 
status. They have seen a doc-
tor; they know whether they are 
healthy or not.” 

The coordinators also pre-

sented facts about eating disor-
ders. Approximately 28 percent 
of women and 10 percent of 
men at the University who were 
screened in a U-SHAPE survey 
were found to have an eating dis-

Council to address possible dioxane 
contamination in A2 groundwater

Work session to feature 

remarks from Dept. 
of Environmental 

Quality

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Ann Arbor City Council will hear 

the Michigan Department of Envi-
ronmental Quality’s plans for mov-

ing forward with the plume of toxic 
1,4-dioxane in the city’s groundwa-
ter during a Monday working ses-
sion.

The contaminated plume — 

located underground in Scio Town-
ship and Ann Arbor, and creeping 
toward the Huron River, which is 
where the city’s drinking water is 
drawn from — was caused by Gel-
man Sciences’ improper disposal of 
1,4-dioxane from 1966 to 1986. Pall 
Corporation, which acquired Gel-
man in 1997, is the company cur-

rently liable for the contamination.

Public scrutiny on this issue was 

re-energized in recent months by 
the Flint water crisis, and local lead-
ers have been clamoring for DEQ to 
take a harder stance.

In a Washtenaw County Board of 

Commissioners meeting earlier this 
month, DEQ representative Robert 
Wagner said state regulations and 
legal settlements dictate Pall is only 
required to “risk manage,” rather 
than clean, the dioxane plume.

According to the City Council 

meeting agenda, Pall Corporation 
was invited to give a presentation at 
the meeting but will not be attend-
ing.

Councilmember Sabra Briere 

(D–Ward 1) said her first priority is 
to learn how soon DEQ’s cleanup 
guidelines for 1,4-dioxane will be 
revised. With revised guidelines, 
Briere hopes that further legal 
action could be taken against Pall 
Corporation to compel a more thor-
ough monitoring and cleanup sys-
tem.

The current DEQ standard for 

1,4-dioxane is 85 parts per billion 
in groundwater, despite EPA stan-
dards saying 3.5 parts per billion is 
carcinogenic. Ann Arbor has been-
pushing for the revision of DEQ 
standards for the past three years. 
Wagner hadassured the Washt-
enaw County Board of Commission-
ers that revised standards would be 
released soon despite unforeseen 
delays in releasing them in the past.

“Once we have (revised stan-

dards), the city and the county are 
in a position to go to the courts, and 
ask the courts to enforce to that 
standard instead of the 85 parts per 
billion,” Briere said. “That allows 
us to open up the entire discussion 
about how the enforcement works, 
what the cleanup looks like, how 
effective the cleanup needs to be.”

She added that she thought that 

the current agreement between the 
state and Pall Corporation over-
whelmingly favors Pall.

“Unlike every other major pol-

lution issue in this state, the state 
of Michigan is paying for this, not 
the polluter,” Briere said. “All the 
time that the DEQ spends on this is

University 
researchers collect 
norovirus samples

Researchers at the Medical 

School began collecting samples 
from the recent outbreak of 
norovirus that swept campus 
earlier this month, the University 
announced on Wednesday. 

More than 100 students were 

infected by a strain of the virus 
causing diarrhea and vomiting. The 
University confirmed last week that 
the initial infections were traced to 
dining halls, though the outbreak 
may have spread beyond residence 
halls. 

Though the virus is fairly 

common, it is difficult to grow in 
laboratory settings. Dr. Christiane 
Wobus, a microbiologist at the 
Medical School, has studied the 
disease in mice for the past 10 
years and is now investigating 
stool samples from members of the 
campus community who recently 
experienced symptoms. 

No approved vaccines or 

treatments currently exist for the 
virus. Wobus and other researchers 
will compare the human samples 
to the infected mice and attempt 
to determine the way the virus 
interacts with human cells. 
Detroit mayor finds 
$50 million in 
unused city bonds

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan 

revealed $50 million dollars in 
unspent bond funds as a part of his 
new budget plan, The Detroit News 
reported on Thursday. 

The unspent funds date back to 

1987, and will be allocated toward 
improvements to public safety 
and parks. Duggan’s proposal 
allocates $11.7 million to city parks, 
$7.5 million to the Detroit Police 
Department’s Real Time Crime 
Center and $7 million toward 
updating the police department’s 
8th precinct in northwest Detroit. 

John Hill, the city’s chief 

financial officer, presented the four-
year balanced budget plan, which 
calls for conservative spending by 
the city for the foreseeable future. 

Discussion of the plan centered 

around shortages in pension 
funds. The city’s bankruptcy plan, 
organized by the former state-
funded emergency management 
team, promised full funding 
of pension obligations to city 
employees. Duggan announced 
in his remarks, however, that the 
forecast was inaccurate. He hopes to 
put together an organized approach 
before the city must begin making 
payments in 2024. 

 

Odeh’s verdict 
vacated by federal 
appeals court

A federal appeals court approved 

an appeal on Thursday in the case 
of Rasmea Odeh, a former Jackson 
resident originally found guilty for 
lying on immigration forms, the 
Detroit Free Press reported.

Odeh, originally from Palestine, 

was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney 
for the Eastern District of Michigan 
for not revealing her role in a 1969 
civilian bombing in Israel when 
entering the United States. Her case 
quickly became a rallying point for 
Palestinian rights groups around the 
country.

Workplace shooting 
in Kansas plant

Four to seven people have 

been killed and 20 injured in a 
workplace shooting in Hesston, 
Kan. on Thursday, NPR reported. 
The suspected shooter, identified by 
employees as coworker Cedric Ford, 
opened fire at Excel Industries, 
a local manufacturing plant. 
According to a local sheriff, Ford 
was fatally shot by authorities.

Nearby Hesston College put the 

campus on lockdown in response 
to the shooting. About 375 students, 
plus staff members, remained on 
school grounds for several hours.

To help create Mcity, the Uni-

General Motors. In addition 
to Mcity, the state of Michi-

in the country.

The 32-acre testing site simu-

and you can see what ward they’re 
in,” said Jacqueline Beaudry, Ann 
Arbor city clerk, in an interview. 
“Students can choose to register 
to vote in Ann Arbor and some 
do.”

To have their name on the bal-

lot for primary elections, which 
will take place in August, partisan 
candidates must submit a peti-
tion containing 100 signatures by 
April 19.

To verify a signature is viable, 

Beaudry said the city cross-ref-
erences the petition with a data-
base of registered voters, which 
is linked to the Secretary of State. 
According to Michigan law, voter 
registration and drivers operat-
ing licenses must have the same 
address.

Beaudry said only one candi-

date — Diane Giannola, a Demo-
crat seeking the Ward 4 seat 
currently held by Krapohl — has 
filed a completed petition as of 
Thursday, though petitions for 
others have already begun to cir-

culate. Giannola is a former mem-
ber of the Ann Arbor Planning 
Commission, and works as in the 
University of Michigan’s Tech 
Transfer lab as a Venture Accel-
erator Manager. She is a Univer-
sity alum.

Ann Arbor resident Will Leaf 

has also pulled petitions to repre-
sent the First Ward. He is attempt-
ing to run again after challenging 
current 
councilmember 
Sabra 

Briere (D–Ward 1) last year. Leaf 
intends to run as a Democrat, hop-
ing to fill the seat currently held 
by Sumi Kailasapathy (D–Ward 
1). Kailasapathy has not yet pulled 
a petition for re-election.

There are aso independent 

candidates, such as Ann Arbor 
resident Kevin Leeser in Ward 5, 
running. Independant candidates 
must file a petition comparable 
to those for partisan candidates 
by July 21 to be on the November 
general election ballot.

Leeser has pulled petitions to 

run as an independent candidate 
for a seat representing the 5th 
Ward. He lost in last year’s elec-
tions to Chip Smith (D–Ward 5), 
when he ran as a write-in candi-

date. Lesser is a U-M Health Sys-
tem nurse and University alum.

This year he is vying to fill the 

seat on Council currently held by 
Warpehoski. In last year’s cam-
paign, Leeser focused primarily 
on bicycle and pedestrian safety. 
He has also expressed opposition 
to the ongoing Ann Arbor deer 
cull, of which Warpehoski is in 
favor.

For both mayoral and Council 

seats, each term lasts two years, 
with half of Council eligible for 
reelection each year. This year 
is also a mayoral election year 
— Taylor, currently running for 
mayor without opposition, pulled 
his petitions last month.

Candidates running for mayor 

must collect 50 signatures from 
residents in each ward of the city, 
requiring them to collect a total of 
250 signatures.

“Even if he had, say, 100 but 

they were all from the Fifth Ward, 
he’d still need to get the 50 from 
each of the other wards,” Beaudry 
said.

eral benefits of the proposed

For students, the new center 

will mean the opportunity for 
increased seating on each bus, 
Hank Baier, associate vice presi-
dent for facilities and opera-
tions, said.

“We currently cannot service 

articulated buses at our cur-
rent facility,” Baier said. “We 
can transport more passengers 

between North Campus and 
Central Campus, which is our 
biggest student demand.”

The center’s future North 

Campus location will also mean 
buses will no longer need to 
drive from the current facilities’ 
South Campus location to North 
Campus each morning to begin 
their routes, meaning less fuel 
will be used, Baier added.

“The more people we put per 

trip, the better our emissions 
characteristics, so it also helps

sity — and, in turn, students 
— money. According to a newly 
released report analyzing pub-
lic transit alternatives in Ann 
Arbor, a light rail is the most 
cost-effective 
option. 
That 

being said, the entire project is 
estimated to cost between 500 
and 700 million dollars and 
add an additional 8-percent 
increase in annual operating 
costs to both the University 
and the city of Ann Arbor. 
Subsequently, in the immedi-
ate future, students could see 
a tuition hike. It should be 
noted, however, that similar 

projects in the past have been 
paid for with a combination of 
federal, state and University 
funding, along with public and 
private partnerships. The Uni-
versity would not be taking on 
this project alone.

Though the project would 

be expensive in the immediate 
future, it would likely save the 
University and students money 
in the long run. A light rail 
would provide an easy, acces-
sible, convenient, ultimately 
less expensive and more envi-
ronmentally friendly way to 
bridge the gulf between our 
campuses and greatly improve 
the quality of student and city 
life.

he felt at home at the University 
of Michigan, and emphasized the 
positive effects finding that the 
community had on him. Solidar-
ity, he noted, was key to many 
communities on campus.

“I want to get to the topic of 

building solidarity, which is why 
we are all here today — margin-
alised students here at UMich,” 
Reed said. “There’s Black stu-
dents, there’s Latino students, 
there’s Native American students, 
and there’s not a lot of us here. We 
can’t afford not to come together 
in solidarity.”

He stressed the importance of 

MSA and BSU students attending 

each other’s events for the educa-
tional experience.

“If we can erase that petty 

mindset that comes with Uni-
versity students who are so cen-
tered upon making sure that 
their individual organization or 
their resume, or these superficial 
things, are so padded with junk, 
then we can really make change,” 
Reed said.

University 
alum 
Donavan 

McKinney, 
another 
panelists, 

took a different approach to 
the idea of solidarity. Though 
he echoed Reed’s sentiments 
about coming together as a cam-
pus community, McKinney said 
he advocated for the Muslim 
and Black communities coming 
together economically, by mak-
ing contributions to one another’s 

organizations and events.

LSA senior Lehman Robinson, 

who attended the event, said he 
has personally struggled with the 
intersectionality of his Black and 
Muslim identities. 

“Being a Black Muslim it is 

important to combine our com-
munities and I found it hard to be 
Black and be Muslim at the same 
time,” Robinson said. “I find it 
harder to go into the BSU being 
Muslim.”

This is the third and final MSA 

event for Black Heritage Month. 
MSA also hosted a discussion of 
the African and African-Ameri-
can history of Islam, and a talk on 
mass incarceration from the lens 
of a Muslim narrative leading up

Ayub emphasized the need

Councilmember Chip Smith

appointed in DEQ’s continued 
failure to update its 1,4-dioxane

of trust in the community of DEQ.

“Frankly, DEQ’s got a little 

bridge building to do on Monday 
night,” Smith said. “We’ve been 
very patiently waiting for (the new 
standards) as this plume creeps 
closer and closer to the river and 
impacts more and more private 
wells.”

“Their failure to deliver on this 

is a pretty big failure, in light of 
the DEQ’s failures in other areas 
— namely Flint — I think there is 
rightfully an awful lot of concern 
in our community,” Smith added.

Ann Arbor woman killed in collision
Incident involving 

truck caused 
closure of all 

eastbound traffic

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

A car crash on I-94 resulted 

in the death of a 21-year-old Ann 
Arbor woman Wednesday night. 
Another woman was in critical 
condition after the incident.

The collision of a semi-truck 

and a car occurred just after 6 

p.m. on I-94 East, near Pittsfield 
Township. A 30-year-old woman 
was driving in the far left lane 
when, according to the Michi-
gan State Police, she lost con-
trol and swerved in front of the 
semi-truck, killing the 21-year-
old passenger. The crash is still 
under investigation.

The incident resulted in the 

closure of eastbound I-94 for 
six hours Wednesday night. It 
happened amid a heavy and 
wet snowfall, which began that 
afternoon and accumulated sev-
eral inches of slush and snow. 
The National Weather Service 

released a winter storm advi-
sory in the days leading up to 
the snowfall, predicting upward 
of 10 inches in some areas. The 
peak of the snowfall happened 
Wednesday 
afternoon 
into 

nighttime, covering the time that 
the I-94 accident took place.

Other 
car 
accidents 
also 

occurred due to the severe 
weather Wednesday. The sys-
tem, formally named Winter 
Storm Petros, hit much of the 
southeastern parts of the state.

Earlier this month, rookie NYPD Officer 

Peter Liang was convicted of manslaughter 
for the death of Akai Gurley. This punish-
ment is being hailed as a landmark convic-
tion in the fight to stop police brutality and 
the repeated shootings of unarmed Black 
men by the police. However, Gurley’s death 
differs from many other shootings because 
Officer Liang did not intentionally shoot, 
but rather accidentally discharged his 
weapon, which ricocheted into Mr. Gurley. 
Also controversially, Liang was only a rook-
ie, and was paired with another rookie and 
placed in one of the most dangerous hous-
ing projects in New York City. He wasn’t 
properly trained in when to use his weapon, 
and didn’t have a superior officer present to 
direct him.

While I am happy there is finally some 

degree of justice for a shooting of an 
unarmed Black man by a police officer, I am 
not happy the NYPD has made Officer Liang 
— an Asian American — the scapegoat for 
hundreds of shootings perpetrated by white 
officers. In this case, rather than seeking 
real justice, it feels as though the NYPD is 
going after a minority officer to “make up” 
for hundreds of unjust killings.

Since 1999, there have been more than 175 

fatal shootings by on-duty officers in New 
York City. Of these, only three have led to 
indictments. Before the conviction of Liang, 
only one shooting led to a conviction.

That case, the 2003 shooting of Ous-

mane Zongo, involved a plainclothes officer 
intentionally shooting an unarmed Black 
man in the back four times. That officer, 
Bryan Conroy, is white and was convicted 
of criminally negligent homicide. He was 
sentenced to probation. Now, Officer Liang 
is being sentenced to up to 15 years in prison 
for accidentally discharging his weapon.

In a perfect world, justice would be served 

for every unjust shooting, but unfortunate-

ly, this is not a perfect world. Eric Garner’s 
murderer was let off the hook in the same 
city, despite a video showing him violating 
a protocol by putting Garner in a chokehold 
and killing him. Even other accidental police 
shootings, like the shooting of Aiyana Stanley-
Jones in Detroit, led to charges being dropped 
and jail avoided. In the case of Jones, a white 
Detroit police officer killed a seven-year-old 
girl in her sleep during a SWAT raid on the 
wrong house. His charges were dropped, 
despite the fact that he had accidentally killed 
a young girl. The only difference between 
Liang and the DPD officer is their race.

I’d like to stress that I believe Peter Liang 

should go to prison. Anyone who kills anoth-
er person, criminal or cop, should face jus-
tice. The problem is this shooting is another 
example of racial discrimination against peo-
ple of color by the justice system. This senti-
ment is highlighted by the New York City City 
Comptroller John Liu, who said, “In the wake 
of unfortunately so many deaths of unarmed 
Black men, some cops gotta hang. The senti-
ment in the Asian community is: It’s easier 
to hang an Asian, because Asians, they don’t 
speak up.” And that is exactly what is going 
on in this case.

Justice is necessary in our society. How-

ever, racial bias disguised as racial justice 
is not acceptable. Don’t be so quick to cel-
ebrate the conviction. Had Peter Liang been 
white, this case could have gone much dif-
ferently. Maybe this is the first step in a long 
road to equality, but most likely, this is just 
another act of racism by the justice system.

I won’t celebrate the conviction of Liang, 

but I will celebrate if one day, the officers 
like the ones who killed Eric Garner and 
Aiyana Jones — white men who knew what 
they were doing — face the same standard of 
justice as Peter Liang.

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

“For many years, it’s been clear that the detention facility 

at Guantanamo Bay does not advance our national 

security — it undermines it”

I 

was recently rejected when I took a 
chance and decided to ask out the guy 
I’m into. To be quite honest, it was 

mortifying. I’m still try-
ing to come back from 
it. The moment it hap-
pened, I texted everyone 
I knew, frantically hop-
ing for someone to tell 
me it wasn’t the end of 
the world, even though to 
me it was. It was among 
the dozen or so replies I 
received in the wake of my 
dilemma that I realized 
just how useless it is to 
seek comfort after some-
thing as silly as someone saying no.

There’s this weird habit among girls when 

it comes to helping each other face rejection. 
When a boy says no to us, it’s a knee-jerk reac-
tion to exclaim “He’s intimidated! We’re too 
smart, we’re too pretty, we’re too funny and 
they’re too insecure, too scared or their egos 
are too fragile to be able to deal with it.” As 
though the worst thing in the world is for a 
boy to just genuinely not like us. 

I’ll tell you right now I’m the furthest 

thing from being intimidatingly pretty, 
smart or funny. I stand at 4 foot 11 with 
frizzy hair and big scary eyes. I laugh way 
too hard at my own jokes even when no one 
else is laughing. I’ve been known to make 
awkward comments and talk far too often 
about chickens. I’m nothing extraordi-
nary. In fact, I’m a little weird. There’s no 
way anyone could ever find me the least bit 
intimidating, unless I’m hungry and even 
then I’m probably more akin to the puny 
Scrappy Doo, always futilely trying to fight 
the big monsters. 

The other fraction of the answers I 

received consisted of some variation of “You 
don’t want to be with someone who doesn’t 
want to be with you anyways.” Technical-
ly this is true. I don’t want a guy to lie and 
string me along pretending to like me for 
the sake of protecting my feelings. I under-

stand what my friends are saying is only a 
defense mechanism to try to make me feel 
better. But I don’t think we should cut down 
the guy who rejects one of us, or tell each 
other that we “wouldn’t want to be with 
him anyways” — because we do. We want 
to be with the boy who doesn’t like us. We 
still think he’s great and his rejection isn’t 
a good judge of his character. We’re allowed 
to be hurt and still want the boy who doesn’t 
look at us in that way. I think that’s OK. 

Sometimes we like a boy and he doesn’t 

feel the same. Is there something inherently 
wrong with him for not being into me? Am I 
an unlovable little troll?

I like to think of this as the cultural 

equivalent of men saying women are crazy 
when we show our emotions. It makes us 
feel inferior, as though we are unable to 
handle ourselves. The implication is very 
much the same when we jump so fast to the 
conclusion that men are just intimidated of 
a woman asking them out — that men can’t 
handle not being the dominant figure.

How many times have we, as women, 

rejected a guy who was perfectly nice based 
on a simple lack of attraction? It was noth-
ing against them. We weren’t intimidated by 
their intelligence, their looks or how funny 
they were. They were perfectly wonderful 
guys. We just didn’t view that guy in that 
way. So why is it so hard to accept the same 
might go for us?

Guess what? Sometimes men just don’t 

like us. Plain and simple. There’s nothing 
wrong with us and there’s nothing wrong 
with them. Moments like mine are humbling 
reminders that I’m good enough regardless 
of whether or not he likes me. Rejection 
sucks, but it’s not a testament to who I am 
as a person and it doesn’t mean he’s terrible 
for saying no.

Sometimes a simple no is all we need to 

hear for us to move on to things that are bet-
ter for ourselves.

When a woman is rejected

I

t’s been a tough week. I was 
lucky enough to evade exams, 
but a smattering of papers, 

meetings 
and 

readings 
ate 

up all my time. 
Between 
the 

stress of school 
and the confus-
ing weather out-
side, I couldn’t 
help but pine for 
summer.

For the 10th 

straight 
year, 

I’m 
returning 

to camp in the 
summer. It’ll be my second year 
working in the camp’s trip cen-
ter, where I’ll facilitate backcoun-
try hiking and canoeing trips for 
campers ages nine to 17.

The trips I lead are the same 

trips I took as a camper however 
many years ago. If you were to 
tell 11-year-old me that I’d be a 
tripper (as we’re so affectionately 
called), I probably wouldn’t have 
believed you. My relationship with 
my summer camp’s trip program 
has been complicated, to say the 
least. Capsizing canoes and pour-
ing rain didn’t exactly make for 
the most desirable experience. 
Still, a disproportionate amount of 
my memories from camp — espe-
cially those from my earlier years 
there — are from camping trips, a 
mere three or four days out of the 
24-day session.

Perhaps the brightest memory I 

have from my trips as a camper is 
the way my trippers would respond 
to our pleas to know the time. No 
matter what point of the day it was, 
the time the trippers told us was 
always — infallibly — seven o’clock.

Obviously as an 11-year-old, this 

was not an adequate answer to this 
question. (Granted, telling 11-year-
old me it was 5:45 when the time was 
actually 5:46 wouldn’t have been an 
acceptable answer.) It felt almost evil 
that they’d withhold the exact time 

— a seemingly harmless number — 
from us. It seemed the worst thing 
knowing the time would do was loan 
us some form of comfort or control.

My summer camp has since real-

ized that withholding the time from 
campers on trips merely heightens 
their anxiety, especially for those 
campers who have never been on 
a trip before. As a tripper, I am no 
longer allowed to tell my campers 
it’s seven o’clock. But I’ve come to 
question whether or not this “ban” 
is a good thing.

Two summers ago, I read Neil 

Postman’s “Amusing Ourselves to 
Death,” which focused primarily on 
how technology changes discourse 
within a society. In the first chapter 
of this book, Postman uses the con-
cept of time to argue how technol-
ogy changes human perception and 
behavior. He argues that minutes 
and seconds never existed before 
the creation of the clock. The power 
of nature as timekeeper quickly 
subsided to these quantifiable mea-
sures of time.

I had never thought about our 

concept of time being based solely on 
man-made conventions before, and, 
by extension, I had never thought 
about the implications of such an 
unnatural mode of telling time. And 
while structured time may be neces-
sary for societal organization and 
progress, perhaps humans were not 
meant to lead lives according to the 
point values affixed to seconds and 
minutes and hours.

Yet how often do we find 

ourselves obsessing over these 
arbitrary measures of time? As 
students, we’re constantly remind-
ed of deadlines, meetings and lec-
tures, rigid in time, dictating our 
every action. Even as I write this 
article, I fret over the fact that I 
only have 26 more hours to com-
plete it, and between now and then 
I have classes to go to, meals to eat 
and homework to finish.

To compensate for the limited 

number of hours in a day, I often 

forgo opportunities to do things I 
actually want to do in order to free 
up more time for the assignments 
that demand completion by a cer-
tain date and hour. Instead of read-
ing a book I’ve been waiting to read, 
I’ll work on an English assignment; 
instead of exploring Ann Arbor, I’ll 
practice chemistry problems.

Of course, I attend this univer-

sity to receive an education, and I 
must do these things to rightfully 
earn my degree. I also find time to 
participate in activities I enjoy, but 
I can’t help but yearn for the days 
where I take out trips. When I lead 
trips, I get to break free from the 
constructs of time. The only dead-
line we have is the time the bus 
comes back to pick us up and take 
us home. The rest of the time we get 
to spend how we choose.

On trips, we eat not because it 

is time to do so, but because we’re 
hungry; we sleep not because it’s 
late, but because we’re tired; we act 
not because we feel like we’re wast-
ing time sitting idly, but because 
we want to do so. When we forget 
about time, we allow our spirits to 
run wild and free. And as a result, 
the gratification we feel from our 
actions is amplified greatly.

As college students, we constant-

ly try to find ways to fill our time, 
whether it’s catching up on a class’s 
reading or making progress toward 
our inevitable careers. In this, we 
often neglect that our college years 
are some of the last we have to do the 
things we’ve always wished to do 
without defaulting on our responsi-
bilities. Soon enough, we will have 
jobs and families and other obliga-
tions to tend to on a daily basis. So 
why not take some time off and do 
the things we love without worrying 
about the passing hours?

I may not be allowed to say it to 

my campers this summer, but for 
me, it’ll always be seven o’clock.

I 

lowered myself onto a shrink-
wrapped examination table and 
focused on the ceiling tile grid 

above me while 
my 
physical 

therapist 
prod-

ded me with a 
cold, metal ultra-
sound probe. I 
rustled the sani-
tary paper on the 
table as I winced 
in 
anticipation 

for the pain that 
inevitably 
fol-

lowed the pro-
cedure. I never 
expected that such a painful physi-
cal condition would be incited by a 
mental illness.

I have experienced very acute 

pelvic pain for as long as I can 
remember. Pelvic pain frequently 
occurs in women as a response to 
different stress factors. For those 
who don’t know what pelvic pain 
feels like, it can feel anywhere from 
a slight cramping to a needle pok-
ing you in your abdomen or lower 
pelvic area. Pelvic pain is often 
chronic, and is frequently induced 
in women by certain stressors, 
such as sexual intercourse or preg-
nancy. Unfortunately, in my case, 
the sharp pelvic pain occurred 
during and after sex.

As you can imagine, this made 

sex extremely painful, frustrating 
and sometimes impossible. For the 
most part, my partners were sympa-
thetic to my situation, but I remained 
frustrated. To this day, I believe that 
being able to have consensual and 
enjoyable sex is a very important part 
of a healthy relationship. Not being 
able to experience the intimacy that 
comes with sexual intercourse was 
deeply exhausting.

The cause of the pain was 

unknown, but my primary doctor 
referred me to a physical therapist 

at the University of Michigan’s 
Von Voigtlander Women’s Hospi-
tal with the intuition that physi-
cal therapy might be a good first 
course of action to take. I put on 
a gown twice a week and sat on 
an examination table in a small, 
softly lit room and waited for a 
doctor to direct me in embarrass-
ing pelvic-strengthening physi-
cal therapy exercises. With every 
visit, the pelvic exercises became 
more invasive and mentally chal-
lenging. I couldn’t even begin 
to tackle certain exercises due 
to mental roadblocks that I was 
too scared to overcome. I ques-
tioned if the embarrassment was 
worth the physical therapy visits 
because, after all, this was a shot 
in the dark. No doctor knew if 
these exercises alone would actu-
ally help fix my problem. I noticed 
very little changes in my condi-
tions after six months of mentally 
straining physical therapy.

Recently, I learned that my gen-

eralized anxiety disorder strongly 
attributed to the presence of the 
pelvic pain that I experienced. The 
physical pain I experienced was ago-
nizing, but the mental suffering was 
worse. I worried incessantly about 
pleasing my partner or the act of 
sex itself. This worry triggered my 
body to defend itself by signaling my 
pelvis to contract, making penetra-
tion painful. I started to associate 
sex with pain and as a result of that 
I avoided sexual and romantic rela-
tionships with men and women in 
fear of the embarrassment that came 
with intercourse. It was noticeable 
that as my anxiety toward the situ-
ation grew, my condition worsened. 
I started to develop an unreasonable 
fear of the pain, and I was unable 
to progress in my physical therapy 
exercises without going into a panic.

As I treated my anxiety, I noticed 

a change in my level of personal 

comfort during romantic situations. 
My physical responses in these situ-
ations also benefitted tremendously 
as I paired physical therapy exer-
cises with anxiety treatments.

Painful penetration is a symptom 

shared by women who have anxi-
ety. It is common for women with 
anxiety to experience the inability 
to self lubricate, making sex pain-
ful. Anxiety-induced pelvic pain 
is another noteworthy example of 
how mental health directly affects 
physical wellbeing in women. It is 
important to be aware that, in many 
women, pelvic problems go untreat-
ed due to the lack of knowledge on 
this health issue.

For a long time, I didn’t know what 

caused the pain. I went in for physi-
cal therapy and ultrasounds, and 
even debated receiving steroid shots, 
all in the hope of relieving even the 
smallest amount of pain. It became 
evident to me that women’s health 
takes a backseat to men’s health 
when I learned that limited research 
has been done on the causes of pel-
vic problems in women. It continues 
to be very strange to me that even 
though many women suffer from this 
condition, there is a lack of interest in 
medical research on this topic.

Women have long been neglect-

ed in the medical world, especially 
women who come from backgrounds 
of abuse and poverty. It is impor-
tant that we continue to encourage 
women’s mental and physical health 
research so that we can produce 
knowledge and resources and make 
them widely available. We can create 
a strong support network between 
women through the sharing of per-
sonal anecdotes. The solidarity that 
we develop when we share our stories 
has the power to give us the courage 
to inspire change in women’s health.

Breezy, happy ‘Light’

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

Daily Arts Writer

In my mind, I always think I like 

Ra Ra Riot more than I actually do. 
The thing about Ra Ra Riot is that 
they have a few 
jams, but only 
just a few. “Can 
You Tell” and 
“The Orchard” 
are 
the 
shit, 

and if anyone 
says otherwise 
they’re 
just 

lying. The prob-
lem I now real-
ize, though, is that “Can You Tell” 
and “The Orchard” are the only 
Ra Ra Riot songs that I’ll never 
tire of — every other song they’ve 
ever produced sounds identical 
and annoying after three listens. 
And as I’m sitting here at Espres-
so Royale listening to their latest 
album, Need Your Light, I find it 
hard to decipher one song from 
the next.

Produced 
by 
Rostam 
Bat-

manglij, formerly of Vampire 
Weekend, Need Your Light is a 
10-track, feel-good album falling 

somewhere in between Passion 
Pit’s high-energy, upbeat vibes 
and Vampire Weekend’s baroque/
indie-rock sound. Overall, the 
album as a whole isn’t awful — Ra 
Ra Riot’s sound has come a long 
way, no doubt. With dazzling vio-
lins intertwined with Wes Miles’s 
iconic chirpy vocals and electronic 
synth beats, Need Your Light is one 
of the least depressing albums I’ve 
ever listened to. It could be played 
at an ’80s dance party, on the 
beach as you sip a pina colada or as 
you lay in an eno, swaying peace-
fully on a breezy summer evening, 
high on all sorts of good stuff.

Despite the fact that this album 

almost took away the pain of my 
broken foot with its peaceful, 
positive energy, I failed to add a 
single song to any playlist. It’s not 
that any song in particular is bad, 
they just all sound the same. For 
example, “Absolutely” is a pretty 
solid jam, in that I could play it in 
the car for a few weeks without 
tiring of it, but will it be played a 
year from now? Nah. Similarly, I 
would dub “Call Me Out” a high-
light of the album — it’s catchy, 
features the iconic Ra Ra Riot 

violin/cello integration and sur-
prisingly features lyrics that actu-
ally vary every line or two — but, 
again, I can barely remember 
what it sounds like after listening 
to the rest of the album.

The only significantly different 

songs, at the end of the day, aren’t 
even Ra Ra Riot products at all — 
Rostam was featured on “Waters” 
and “I Need Your Light,” resulting 
in the two best and the two most 
stylistically distinct songs on the 
album. “Waters” is a smooth, 
calming track while “I Need Your 
Light” is just all around solid. But 
I think it’s only solid because Ros-
tam made it solid. It’s less synth-
pop and more indie-rock, Vampire 
Weekend-esque with the soaring 
vocals and lack of bombastic Ra 
Ra Riot instrumentals; the minute 
“I Need Your Light” ends, though, 
we’re back to the same old Ra Ra 
Riot sound that dominates the 
album.

But this is where my song-by-

song commentary ends — the 
remainder of the album isn’t much 
to elaborate on aside from the fact 
that it very well might have been 
intended for Cyndi Lauper to sing.

Intelligent ‘Yorker’ 

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

The New Yorker is known for its 

polished prose, witty cartoons and 
sophisticated style. With Amazon 
Prime 
Video’s 

“The New York-
er 
Presents”, 

the magazine’s 
elegance 
has 

been transmut-
ed to screen. 
Overseen 
by 

Oscar-winning 
filmmaker Alex 
Gibney (“Going 
Clear: 
Scien-

tology and the 
Prison of Belief”), the series offers 
short narrative films, documentary 
work, poetry, animation and car-
toons, as well as exposure to some 
critically acclaimed artists of a 
variety of mediums. Compelling in 
both form and content, “The New 
Yorker Presents” seems poised not 
only to become the strongest cur-
rent option of docutainment but to 
be another weapon in Amazon’s 
battle as it strives to reach the kind 
of popularity that Netflix has a 
streaming service.

The pilot opens with a segment 

on people that have the “Truman 
Show Delusion” — they think their 
lives are being filmed without their 
consent for reality television — 
which immediately hooks viewers. 
It features a segment from Gibney 
 

about how 9/11 could have been 
prevented, if the CIA hadn’t kept 

information from the FBI. Though 
a complex and perhaps risky seg-
ment to start out with — especially 
considering they only have 34 min-
utes to fill — it’s comprehensive; an 
outline is given of all the informa-
tion to which the CIA had access 
and withheld from important FBI 
agents. By analyzing these events 
through the tension between these 
two organizations, the writers 
of this segment stay away from 
sounding too much like govern-
mental conspiracy theorists. 

The show adds a dose of humor 

in the form of a short narrative film, 
“Le Café de Blazac” — shot with a 
perhaps semi-ironic yet still aes-
thetically pleasing sepia filter — in 
which Paul Giamatti (“Sideways”) 
plays Honore de Blazac, the 19th 
century French author known for 
drinking unbelievable amounts of 
coffee daily. An even shorter come-
dic piece by Simon Rich (creator of 
“Man Seeking Woman”) features 
Alan Cumming (“The Good Wife”) 
playing God speaking to Brett Gel-
man (“The Other Guys”), who runs 
around preaching in his under-
wear, as per God’s instructions.

Within the first few episodes, 

there’s an interview with perfor-
mance artist Marina Abramovic. 
Due to time constraints, it feels like 
a more superficial introduction to 
her work than she may deserve, but 
it’s functional and fun nonethe-
less. The main investigative piece 
is a profile on biologist Tyrone 
Hayes, which is as entertaining 
as it is informative. Finally, one of 

the most evocative pieces is the 
exploration of racialized violence 
in America through art by writer 
Edwidge Danticat, in a segment 
titled “Black Bodies in Motion and 
in Pain,” inspired by Jacob Law-
rence’s Migration Series.

The b-roll in “The New Yorker 

Presents” is just as skilfully made 
and beautiful to watch as the foot-
age from the main stories, and the 
score always perfectly comple-
ments the segment. The animated 
cartoon sequences and The New 
Yorker office vignettes provide 
breathing space in between the 
more complex stories, and balance 
out the journalistic and creative 
elements. Unlike other NYC-cen-
tric media, it’s completely acces-
sible to those who aren’t familiar 
with the magazine — though for 
those that do read it, there are 
familiar touches. The style of The 
New Yorker’s copy — down to the 
fonts — is echoed in the cinematog-
raphy.

“The New Yorker Presents” may 

feel uneven in terms of what kind 
of content is in each episode, but 
that doesn’t detract from it; rather, 
it’s one of the strongest points of 
the show. The combination and 
complementation of documenta-
ry-style work, animated cartoons, 
narrative films and storytelling, 
poetry and conversations with art-
ists is what makes the series fun 
to watch in a way that a straight 
documentary often struggles to 
accomplish.

‘Love’ is complex

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Most TV shows that face the 

subject of love head-on tend to 
take a formulaic route: boy-meets-
girl 
premise, 

simplistic sup-
porting charac-
ters, romantic 
setting, 
some 

sort of conflict 
and 
resolu-

tion, etc. It’s a 
rather 
broad 

and 
touchy 

topic that has 
been 
recycled 

over and over again for years in 
pop culture. But who says love 
doesn’t still contain some artistic 
merit? For Netflix’s newest origi-
nal series, “Love,” all those clichés 
about love, romance and relation-
ships are thrown out the window 
for a practical, grounded perspec-
tive on every aspect of the show’s 
namesake. 

Despite 
its 
grating, 
gener-

ic-sounding name, “Love” is a 
down-to-earth, charming comedy 
bolstered by strong writing, two 
standout leads and a stinging sense 
of realism. Set in L.A. (my home-
town), the story follows two thirty-
somethings, the socially awkward 
Gus (Paul Rust, “I Love You Beth 
Cooper”) and the aimless Mickey 
(Gillian Jacobs, “Life Partners”), 
and their developing relationship 
from strangers to friends to pos-
sibly more than friends. Through 
awkward dates, revealing confron-
tations between exes and other 
romantic and sexual misadven-
tures, Gus and Mickey successfully 
and hilariously guide the show’s 
exploration of relationships and 
female outlooks on modern love.

Executive-produced by “Train-

wreck” and “Knocked Up” direc-
tor Judd Apatow, “Love” is exactly 
what you would expect from an 
Apatow production: risqué and 
vulgar, yet full of poignancy and 
heart. It isn’t always laugh-out-
loud funny, but for those who enjoy 
observational humor within the 
underpinnings of day-to-day con-
versations or physical cringe com-
edy, “Love” is the perfect show to 
watch. With a UCB pedigree, Rust 
masterfully embodies the nerdy 
Midwestern nice guy archetype 
as Gus, but his character’s deep-
seated aggression and disappoint-
ment with life’s constant downfalls 
elevates Rust’s acting. Having 
been on six seasons of the NBC-
turned-Yahoo! cult hit “Commu-
nity,” Jacobs effortlessly delivers 
as Mickey, transcending the well-
worn high-functioning alcoholic 
archetype through a subversive, 
passionate performance.

Though its first season is only 10 

episodes, “Love” is steadily paced, 
the characters and plotlines unrav-
eling gradually with each episode 
(Mickey and Gus don’t even meet 
until the end of the first episode). 
One of “Love” ’s greatest strengths 
is making sharp examinations on 
the ecstatic highs and destructive 
lows of human interaction through 
its protagonists’ points of view. 
The third episode, “Tested,” finds 
Gus having trouble with his job as 
an on-set teacher tutor for a bratty 
young TV actress (Iris Apatow, 
“This is 40”), while Mickey has sex 
with her boss, radio host Dr. Greg 
Colter (Brett Gelman, “Another 
Period”), to avoid getting fired. 
“Party in the Hills” depicts Gus 
and Mickey having different expe-
riences at the same party, with Gus 
spontaneously jamming out with a 

few hipster dads to Paul McCart-
ney and Wings’s “Jet,” while 
Mickey tackles an uncomfortable 
situation with two former beaus 
(stand-up comedian Kyle Kinane 
and Rich Sommer, “Mad Men”). 
In “The Date,” Mickey stays home 
and does whatever she can to avoid 
drinking again after going sober, 
while Gus and Mickey’s perky Aus-
sie roommate Bertie (the winning 
Claudia O’Doherty, “Trainwreck”) 
go out on a date that twists and 
turns into an unexpected outcome.

In addition to a tongue-in-cheek 

title sequence and an eclectic 
soundtrack that includes Queen, 
Jamie xx, Diane Coffee and Biz 
Markie, “Love” is stylistically on-
point. As a native of Los Angeles, I 
can definitely say that the cinema-
tography in “Love” does a fantastic 
job of encapsulating both the beau-
ty and energizing nightlife of the 
city, from the hipster-friendliness 
of Echo Park to the laid-back hive 
of Silver Lake. It’s typical to just 
display West Hollywood or Bever-
ly Hills, but “Love” unearths some 
hidden spots in the L.A. backdrop, 
which only adds to the visual and 
emotional experience of watching 
the show.

“Love” isn’t necessarily about 

falling in love or finding love, but 
about human connection and 
interaction in the realest, rawest 
sense. The show doesn’t roman-
ticize or glamorize love; it simply 
shows the complicated, troubled 
and occasionally amusing nature 
intertwined within the context 
of love, whether it’s dealing with 
a breakup from a long-term rela-
tionship, a toxic attachment to an 
old lover or throwing out a collec-
tion of Blu-Ray DVDs to signify the 
media’s distorted idea of what love 
really is.

TV REVIEW
‘Cooked’ brings food 
back to the TV table

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

“For is there any practice less 

selfish, any labor less alienated, any 
time less wasted, than preparing 
something deli-
cious and nour-
ishing for people 
you love?” Best-
selling 
author 

and 
journalist 

Michael Pollan 
writes about his, 
and our, rela-
tionship 
with 

food in a poetic 
cadence, sending an ode to his-
tory and the years of evolution that 
have been shaped by what, where 
and why we eat. Based on Pollan’s 
“Cooked: A Natural History of 
Transformation,” Netflix brings 
his culinary stories and insights 
to screen in “Cooked,” a four-part 
documentary series that ties food 
to the core of our civilization and 
humanity.

Each 
episode 
of 
“Cooked” 

focuses on one of the four natu-
ral elements — fire, water, air and 
ground — and explores the uni-
versal impact that it has had on 
both biology and human nature. 
Continuing the stories of subjects 
in Pollan’s book, the documentary 

series takes on “food” from a global 
perspective, featuring individuals 
from countries like India, Morocco 
and Peru. While what we eat is so 
often categorized by culture and 
regional cuisine, “Cooked” is able 
to paint a picture that shows the 
act of feeding, in all its variety, as 
simple. “We are a product of cook-
ing,” Pollan narrates, arguing that 
the very act of heating up our food 
is what made us human from the 
start. “Fire,” the first episode of 
the series, primes the audience to 
explore humanity through the lens 
of cooking as a group of aborigi-
nal hunters sets fire to a deserted 
landscape. It burns, catching from 
shrub to shrub, but however for-
eign their way of hunting might 
seem, “Cooked” effectively shows 
that the simplest natural elements 
connect us all at our most basic 
need.

From economics to chemistry, 

“Cooked” is able to clearly articu-
late the complicated systems in 
preparing food without losing 
its audience in the process. Cov-
ering an impressive range, Pol-
lan effortlessly transitions from 
detailing the microflora composi-
tion of “designer cheeses,” prod-
ucts of modern fermentation that 
favorably alter human immune 
systems, to discussing the socio-

logical implications of Sunday 
family dinners. The series presents 
food as a relationship, not a prod-
uct, and recognizes the complexity 
of the topic without entitlement or 
blame.

Simply put, the series calls for 

a cooking renaissance. It does not 
push a political or activist agenda 
down the throats of its viewers, 
nor does it scream of boycot-
ting corporations that infiltrate 
our minds and bodies with high 
fructose corn syrup. “Cooked” 
doesn’t forcefully rally for some 
monumental change in society, but 
rather, hopes to reconnect us with 
nature. Pollan explores the time-
consuming, complicated and beau-
tiful relationship between humans 
and food, as sweeping shots of 
desert landscapes and exquisite 
close-ups of bubbling stew show 
that humanity simply could not 
exist without the primal act of 
mixing water and ingredients and 
then heating it up. The docu-series 
is soft-spoken and light, and while 
it fails to capture an unwavering 
and undivided focus, it succeeds in 
gracefully maneuvering through 
the technical aspects of cooking 
as well as backing out to a cultural 
lens. Instead of lecturing people 
back to the kitchen, “Cooked” lures 
them back in.

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Senior Arts Editor

On paper, the ongoing plots of 

“Togetherness” 
seem 
recycled 

from practi-
cally 
every 

other dram-
edy 
about 

white people 
in their 30’s. 
Brett 
Pier-

son (co-cre-
ator 
Mark 

Duplass, 
“The 
One 

I 
Love”) 

and his wife Michelle (Melanie 

Lynskey, “Two and a Half Men”) 
desperately try to reignite their 
spark, which has faded after years 
of marriage. Meanwhile, Brett’s 
dorky best friend, Alex (Steve Zis-
sis, “Jeff, Who Lives at Home”), 
struggles to deal with his feel-
ings for Tina (Amanda Peet, “The 
Whole Nine Yards”), Michelle’s 
sister who’s way out of his league.

The show works so beautifully, 

though, because these characters 
are more than their apparent stock 
roles. With Duplass’s wide-eyed 
earnestness, Brett is well-meaning 
in a way that makes his occasional 
whininess endearing. As well, 
his friendship with Alex is one of 

the most charming male friend-
ships on TV, supportive and joyful 
even during their most unlikable 
moments.

In the second season premiere, 

though, Duplass isn’t the only cen-
tral player at the top of his game. 
Following a radical period of 
weight loss for Zissis, Alex is now 
a successful actor filming a movie 
in New Orleans, with a hot young 
girlfriend of his own. He’s just as 
kind and funny as he was last year, 
but his smile is wider and more 
confident after spending some 
time away from Tina and gaining 
some professional success. Seeing 
this happy new Alex, Tina can’t 

TV REVIEW
Sweet ‘Togetherness’

help but awkwardly step in and try 
to regain his favor, buying him a 
ridiculously expensive compass for 
his birthday. Whether Tina has real 
feelings for Alex or if she just self-
ishly craves his puppy-love atten-
tion, she can’t stand their awkward 
dynamic following his first season 
declaration of love for her. Peet is 
hilarious in her cringe-inducing 
portrayal of Tina as transparently 
jealous and desperate.

Lynskey is another standout, her 

expressions subtle yet managing to 
convey so much. The first season 
ended in a cliffhanger, with Brett 
pledging to be a better husband 
while 
Michelle 
simultaneously 

commits her first infidelity, sleep-
ing with her friend David (John 
Ortiz, “Silver Linings Playbook”). 
Now, the full scene and its after-
math is shown to us in disturbingly 
immersive flashbacks, the sound 

design filled with nightmarish bass 
courtesy of Braids’s “Lammicken.” 
It’s painful, over the course of the 
episode, to see Brett striving to be 
the perfect husband, planning little 
playful surprises and asserting 
his dedication to Michelle. Brett 
notices that something’s been off 
with Michelle, but he attributes it 
to her distrust of his romantic ges-
tures. He has no idea that Michelle 
has had an affair, and going for-
ward, the show will surely build 
towards this devastating revela-
tion.

As affecting as the flashback 

scene is, Zissis and Peet share the 
strongest scene of the episode, the 
ending scene. Frustrated with the 
way Alex has been subtly push-
ing Tina away, she confronts him 
at the ice machine in their New 
Orleans hotel. After an episode full 
of wide smiles and gentle media-

tion, Alex finally lets his confident 
movie star persona fall away, and 
he expresses all the hurt Tina 
caused him by breaking his heart. 
It’s a magnificent scene, with both 
the characters dropping the pas-
sive-aggressive bullshit and laying 
their emotions on the table.

Above all, that emotional hon-

esty is what’s most impressive 
about “Togetherness.” The series 
easily could’ve been just another 
carbon copy of every other show 
of its genre, but its sincerity and 
genuineness makes it something 
heartfelt and deeply emotional. 
Like the Pfefferman dynasty of 
“Transparent” or the Cole fam-
ily of “Casual,” the friends at the 
center of “Togetherness” help the 
series transcend the genre’s cli-
chés. To watch them, feel for them 
and become deeply invested in 
them is a special feeling.

Daily Film Writers 
predict Oscar wins

By DAILY FILM-WRITERS

Best Picture:
Who Will Win: “The Big Short,” 

the sensationalized account of the 
2008 financial crisis, is sure to take 
home Best Picture, and it certainly 
deserves it. With the swerving 
cinematography and electrically 
intricate storyline, director Adam 
McKay (“Anchorman”) finds a 
way to simultaneously entertain 
and educate the American public 
about arguably the stodgiest, most 
boring industry. With its fresh, 
populist take on big business 
alongside some of the biggest 
names in Hollywood, “The Big 
Short” is hard not to root for.

Who Should Win: “Room,” 

the indie darling of this awards 
season, is the excruciating but 
uplifting tale of Jack (Jacob 
Tremblay, “Before I Wake”) and 
his Ma, played to perfection by 

Brie Larson (“Trainwreck”). The 
beauty of “Room” comes from 
the dichotomy of being the most 
anxiety-producing film of the year 
and existing as a quiet testament to 
growing up, highlighting the love 
between parents and children. The 
humanity of the plot and the subtle 
but 
effective 
cinematography 

bolster the unadulterated power 
of the performances of Tremblay 
and Larson, leaving the viewer 
unnerved and exhilarated by the 
film’s close.

— Rebecca Lerner
Best Original Screenplay:
Who Will Win: It can be easy to 

look toward the most harrowing or 
dramatic film when predicting the 
Best Original Screenplay winner, 
but overlooking equally clever 
but lighter films can lead to some 
unexpected upsets. “Spotlight,” 
which presents an incredibly 
precise mix of honest fact and 
subtle 
emotion 
in 
depicting 

Boston Globe journalists exposing 
the Catholic Church molestation 
cover-up, seems like the most 
likely winner for 2016.

Who Should Win: Don’t let 

“Inside Out” ’s clever and engaging 
exploration of emotions within a 
developing mind fall completely 
to the side — it’s an unexpected 
but equally viable candidate for 
its ability to characterize such a 
complex concept. We often have 
trouble understanding feelings 
within ourselves, but “Inside Out” 
makes it look easy.

— Lauren Wood
Best Director
Who 
Will 
Win: 
On 
the 

Oscar campaign trail, there’s 
no shortage of “The Revenant” 
hardship stories. Between the 
frigid temperatures and unique 
natural-light shooting, director 
Alejandro 
González 
Iñárritu 

(“Birdman”), who induces as 
much pain in his characters as 
Darren Aronofsky (“Noah”) or 
Stanley Kubrick (“The Shining”), 
crafted a mind-blowingly visceral 
survival story in the American 
West.

Who Should Win: There’s 

an incredibly strong case to be 
made for George Miller (“Happy 
Feet”), 
whose 
“Mad 
Max” 

revival, “Fury Road,” stunned 
critics 
and 
audiences 
alike 

with its phenomenal effects, 
nearly 90 percent of which were 
practical. But my choice is Tom 
McCarthy (“Win Win”), whose 
Boston-focused journalism story, 
“Spotlight,” is perhaps the only 
movie ever to make a Microsoft 
Excel 
sequence 
absolutely 

riveting.

— Daniel Hensel
Best Actor
Who Will Win: Leo’s not going 

to win because he deserves to 
(the Academy loves snubbing 
“deserving” winners). He’s going 
to win because he gave the sort 
of immersive performance award 
shows go crazy for. Remember 
when Matthew McConaughey 
almost starved to death for 
“Dallas Buyers Club,” or when 
Daniel Day-Lewis broke two ribs 
getting into character for “My 
Left Foot?” The Academy loves 
when actors suffer for their art, 
and Leo’s performance in “The 
Revenant” this year finds the 
actor at peak suffering. He slept 
in animal carcasses and ate raw 
liver for a month. He’s practically 
killing himself for the Oscar. And 
the Academy is going to go crazy 
for that. 

Who Should Win: “Room” 

featured 
both 
of 
the 
year’s 

strongest 
performances. 
Brie 

Larson is a deserving shoe-in 
for Best Actress, and her co-star, 

nine-year-old Jacob Tremblay, 
should be a shoe-in for Best Actor. 
But he’s not even nominated. 
He’s not even nominated for Best 
Supporting Actor. And yet his 
performance as a young child who 
is born and raised in a small room 
is full of the one thing lacking 
in that of the actual nominees: 
honesty. The scene in which 
Tremblay comes eye-to-eye with 
the sky for the first time in his life 
is one of the year’s most powerful 
because Tremblay’s performance 
is so simple and pure. This year’s 
actual nominations for Best Actor 
are weak and disappointingly 
typical of the Oscars — older white 
guys playing biographical roles. 
Why not bring in a ringer and 
give Tremblay the recognition his 
performance deserves?

— Madeleine Gaudin
Best Actress
Who Will Win: She has won 

Best 
Leading 
Actress 
from 

BAFTA, the SAG, the Golden 
Globes and Chicago Film Critics 
Association. If past awards are 
any indicator of who will win 
the Oscar (which they are), odds 
are good for Brie Larson as Ma in 
“Room.” Her performance is, in 
fact, incredible. She elicits such 
raw, visceral emotion, primarily 
interacting with only one other 
actor in a very confining set in 
the first half of the movie. Her 
liberation from the room that 
coincides with her emotional 
and mental incarceration is a 
frightening experience that’s well 
delivered by Larson. Through 
Larson’s performance, “Room” 
creates a vivid reality.

Who Should Win: Although 

all the nominees are deserving 
of the Oscar in some respect, 
Saoirse Ronan’s (“Atonement”) 
performance 
in 
“Brooklyn” 

is 
especially 
heartwarming 

and beautiful — that said, her 
character in the movie naturally 
lends itself to this type of 
performance, so the difficulties 
of playing such a character 
are 
limited. 
Brie 
Larson’s 

performance, on the other hand, 
is downright impressive. She had 
little to work with (a single set and 
a child actor), yet she makes Ma 
feel like a real person. Larson has 
earned this Oscar.

— Joe Wagner
Best Cinematography
Who Will Win: 13 nominations 

later, is it finally time for the 
acclaimed Coen brothers (“Hail 
Caesar!”) 
cinematographer 

Roger Deakins (“Unbroken”) to 
take home the gold? Not likely. 
Sicario looked great in a horribly 
dismal sort of way, but methinks 
the 
Academy 
will 
recognize 

Chivo’s downright breathtaking 
accomplishments 
with 
“The 

Revenant” as the visual splendor 
to win it all this year. It will be the 
third time Emmanuel Lubeszki’s 
(“Birdman”) won consecutively, 
and the only hat trick ever by a 
cinematographer at the Oscars.

Who Should Win: Sorry Roger, 

but I’m going to have to go with 
one Mr. John Seale (“The English 
Patient”) on this one. “Mad Max: 
Fury Road” is the rare big-budget 
film where every single cent of the 
however-many-millions went to 
make sure every single frame was 
masterful — the intimate kind of 
masterful that can’t just be done 
in post. “Fury Road” had a unique 
splendor completely unmatched 
by 
any 
other 
action 
movie, 

even including films within its 
own franchise. Not even “The 
Revenant” ’s jaw-dropping nature 
photography could beat Seale’s 
ultrastylized wasteland.

FILM PREVIEW
TV REVIEW
‘Girls’ grows up

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

When “Girls” debuted on HBO 

in 2012, the show filled a hole in 
the media: a realistic portrayal 
of young people in New York 
City. 
Before, 

there 
was 

“Sex and the 
City,” a show 
about success-
ful 
women, 

established in 
their 
careers, 

looking 
for 

romance; 
and 
“Gossip 

Girl,” 
about 

the drama of 
trust fund teens on Manhattan’s 
Upper East Side. To viewers, 
the women on these shows were 
certainly #goals; there was no 
wardrobe more strongly coveted 
than Carrie Bradshaw’s, no love 
affair more worshipped than 
Blair Waldorf and Chuck Bass’s. 
They were glamorous and fun, 
their problems always fixed 
with a mimosa and a new pair 
of Louboutins. And they were 
totally unrealistic.

“Girls,” 
the 
semi-autobio-

graphical brainchild of Lena 
Dunham 
(“Tiny 
Furniture”), 

tells a much less glamorized 
story of young women trying to 
make it in the Big Apple. Han-
nah (Dunham), Marnie (Allison 
Williams, “Peter Pan Live!”), 
Jessa (Jemima Kirke, “Tiny Fur-
niture”) and Shoshanna (Zosia 
Mamet, “The Kids Are Alright”) 
live as dysfunctional 20-some-
things, 
navigating 
unpaid 

internships, disheveled apart-
ments, college classes and awk-
ward hook-ups.

The girls of “Girls” are cring-

ingly narcissistic, needy and 
often self-destructive in their 
personal and professional lives 
— and while we try hard not 
to, we see our own millennial 
selves in them. Or, better yet, we 
know a self-absorbed Hannah, 
a micromanaging Marnie, an 
annoyingly aloof Jessa. Despite 
the show’s serious flaws — there 
isn’t a single person of color in 
the core cast, for instance — the 
series’s ugly familiarity, the raw 
and unfiltered misadventures, 
has kept an audience coming 
back for five seasons.

But there’s a shift in season 

five: “Girls,” believe it or not, 
seems to be growing up. Since 
Lena Dunham announced in 
January that the show will end 
after six seasons, some clo-
sure is inevitable — as it’s still 
a scripted series, albeit a more 
realistic one, the girls need to 
find solidity (in life, jobs, rela-
tionships, etc.) by the show’s 
finale.

For Marnie, adulthood is 

coming in hot — maybe a little 
too hot. Season five opens with 
Marnie standing before a win-
dow in an upstate New York cot-
tage, dressed in full nude Spanx, 
glaring down at the preparations 
for her outdoor wedding.

Turns out, she and her sing-

ing partner Desi (Ebon Moss-
Bachrach, “The Lake House”) 
have decided to marry after 
all, even though he’s a grade-
A jerkface. But then again, it’s 
hard to feel sympathy for Mar-
nie, who fails miserably at keep-
ing her inner bridezilla under 
wraps. Though she insists on 
being a breezy bride — she tells 
Bebe (Bridget Everett, “Train-
wreck”), the makeup artist, that 
she wants an artsy wedding that 

still reflects her heritage as a 
“white Christian woman” — 
Marnie would rather die than 
have a hairpin out of place.

Naturally, everything falls 

apart. Hannah, fresh from her 
stint as a junior high teacher, is 
back to her old selfish ways — 
bringing her date into the bridal 
room to hang out, then later 
sneaking out for a romp in the 
backseat of his car — and gener-
ally not paying attention to Mar-
nie on the one day she deserves 
it. Jessa has a sneaky hook-up 
as well, with none other than 
Hannah’s ex-boyfriend, Adam 
(Adam Driver, “Star Wars: The 
Force Awakens”). Even Bebe’s 
in the wrong: she misinterprets 
Marnie’s “Joni-Mitchell-meets-
Ralph-Lauren” hair and makeup 
vision as “Selena-Gomez-meets-
Jesus,” giving the bridal party 
shockingly bad makeovers. And 
on top of everything, Marnie’s 
biggest fear comes true: it rains 
for her outdoor wedding.

After a hurricane-level melt-

down, in which Marnie con-
fronts Hannah about her lack of 
support as a friend and maid of 
honor (“The very least you could 
do right now is to pretend that 
I’m doing the right thing,” she 
says) the girls hug it out, Marnie 
wipes off her makeup and they 
all throw raincoats over their 
dresses. When life gives you 
lemons, I guess.

Though Marnie’s marriage 

seems too unstable to last, her 
actions hint at more growth to 
come in “Girls,” which will be 
refreshing to see after years of 
the characters’ same old antics. 
But then again, the show prides 
itself on being realistic — and 
there’s nothing more human 
than sticking to habit.

Bench gives ‘M’ a boost

By SIMON KAUFMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

When 
sophomore 
forward 

Kameron Chatman jumped up 
for an offensive rebound midway 
through the second half in the 
Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
game against Northwestern on 
Wednesday, Caris LeVert and Zak 
Irvin rose, too, from their spots on 
the bench.

The junior and senior guards 

popped 
out 
of 
their 
seats, 

fired up and animated, yelling 
encouragement at their younger 
teammate as he grabbed the 
offensive board and then drew a 
foul in the paint. Chatman sank 
both of his free throws to give 
the Wolverines (10-6 Big Ten, 
20-9 overall) their first lead of the 
game en route to a comeback win 
over the Wildcats.

With Irvin having an off night 

shooting and LeVert missing his 
14th game of the season due to a 
lower-left-leg injury, Chatman 
bodying in for a rebound and 
coming through from the charity 
stripe was a welcome sight for the 
elder players.

Chatman’s two free throws 

were part of a 19-point effort from 
Michigan’s bench Wednesday, 
taking some of the pressure off 
of Irvin and junior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr., who have sometimes 
been the Wolverines’ only reliable 
options with LeVert out.

“We 
play 
team 
basketball 

regardless of what’s going on,” 
Walton said. “I don’t think it’s 
really reliant on me or Zak, 
it just so happens that we’ve 
been playing well. Guys like 
(sophomore 
guards 
Aubrey 

Dawkins 
and 
Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman), they’re doing 
smaller things that are really 
starting to help.”

Dawkins tallied 11 points after 

coming off the bench for Irvin. 
He sank four field goals and was a 
perfect 3-for-3 from deep. He also 

did work on the boards, grabbing a 
game-high seven rebounds.

Sophomore 
forward 
Ricky 

Doyle also added to the bench’s 
production. Doyle came in for 
junior forward Mark Donnal late 
in the second half after Donnal 
picked up his fourth foul, and he 
sank two late free throws down 
the stretch to help Michigan ice 
the game. Doyle finished with six 
points and two boards.

“The bench was huge today,” 

Beilein 
said 
after 
the 
win. 

“Everything 
from 
Kam 
just 

getting in there and getting the 
rebound and making the foul 
shots, Ricky making those foul 
shots at the end, obviously Aubrey 
was a catalyst again for us.”

On defense, Michigan held 

Northwestern’s bench to just 12 
points, marking the first time 
since the Wolverines’ loss to 
Michigan State three weeks ago 
that they’ve had better bench 

production against an opponent. 
Coming into Wednesday’s game, 
Michigan’s 
bench 
had 
been 

outscored, 80-41, in its previous 
four games.

Unheralded starters such as 

Abdur-Rahkman 
and 
Donnal 

have had major contributions, too. 
Abdur-Rahkman led Michigan 
with 19 points Wednesday, and 
Donnal had 17 and 25 points 
against Ohio State and Maryland, 
respectively. 
But 
with 
the 

Wolverines’ lack of depth due to 
injuries, it’s more important now 
that they get production outside of 
their starting five.

Last season, when Michigan was 

plagued by injuries, the bench was 
also a huge factor. The Wolverines’ 
non-starters played 38 percent of 
the team’s minutes last year and 
have played 33 percent of their 
minutes this year. In comparison, 
during Michigan’s Final Four run 
in the 2012-13 season, it was more 

reliant on its starting five, with 
the bench accounting for just 20 
percent of its minutes.

“You see all of our good teams 

over the years, we had a bench 
that could come off and just get 
us some baskets,” Beilein said. 
“(Senior guard Spike Albrecht) 
would find somebody open, he 
would do something. (Former 
Michigan players) Jordan Morgan 
or Jon Horford would come off 
the bench and get something 
done, so that’s key for us. They’re 
earning the trust every day. We 
continue to work with them, and 
they’re doing it.”

With just two regular-season 

games left and then the potential 
of playing multiple games on 
consecutive days in the Big Ten 
Tournament, Michigan’s bench 
could be the difference between 
staying on the bubble for the 
NCAA Tournament and locking 
in a spot on Selection Sunday.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Sophomore forward Kameron Chatman has played sparingly this season but grabbed a crucial rebound Wednesday.

SOFTBALL
Michigan heads 
out to California

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

In 
its 
opening 
weekend 

of play, the No. 2 Michigan 
softball team lost, 8-0, to No. 1 
Florida, the first ranked team 
on its schedule.

Last weekend, the Wolverines 

played No. 13 Florida State 
twice, defeating the Seminoles, 
6-2 and 10-3, respectively.

Friday, Michigan (8-1) heads 

to Palm Springs, Calif., where 
it will face two more ranked 
teams — No. 9 Washington and 
No. 12 Oklahoma — in addition 
to North Carolina State, a team 
that was ranked No. 23 just last 
week. The Wolverines will also 
face Oklahoma State and Long 
Beach State in the Mary Nutter 
Collegiate Classic.

Michigan has shown it can 

compete with some of the top 
teams in the nation, and the 
upcoming tournament provides 
another opportunity for the 
Wolverines to match up against 
more high-quality competition.

“We played some good teams 

this past weekend, and we had 
some close games,” said junior 
right-handed 
pitcher 
Megan 

Betsa on Wednesday. “That was 
good for us. Tight games are good. 
(They) help us learn, help us know 
what we need to work on.”

Michigan will first compete 

against the Sooners, who have 
won seven straight games after 
losing their first two. Oklahoma 
is 19th in the NCAA in batting 
average and 18th in runs per game.

The Sooners will trot out left-

handed pitcher Paige Parker 
— the ace of their staff — who 
is averaging 8.8 strikeouts per 
seven innings.

For Michigan senior second 

baseman Sierra Romero, the 

game has some special meaning, 
as her younger sister, Sydney, 
starts at third base for Oklahoma.

“I’ve never really gotten to 

play against my sister,” Romero 
said. “I think it’s going to be 
a lot of fun, to see how she’s 
grown since she’s been training 
at (Oklahoma). I’m excited to 
play against her and have a little 
sibling rivalry going on.”

In its third game, Michigan 

will take on North Carolina State, 
which is led by right-handed 
pitcher Courtney Mirabella.

In the fourth game, the 

Wolverines will try to contain 
Washington’s bats. The Huskies 
rank No. 9 in the country in 
batting average and No. 4 in 
scoring per game with a solid 
nine runs.

Yet Michigan coach Carol 

Hutchins remains undeterred.

“I 
don’t 
care 
about 
the 

opponents,” Hutchins said. “We 
just need to play good softball, 
catch and throw. We’re trying to 
work on staying in our process, 
in our moment, one pitch at a 
time, and I think we can get 
better at that.”

Romero continues to anchor 

the 
Wolverines 
offensively, 

with a team-leading five home 
runs, 13 RBI and a whopping 
27 
total 
bases. 
Meanwhile, 

Betsa has maintained her solid 
performance from last year, 
averaging a nation-leading 12.9 
strikeouts per seven innings.

For Betsa, however, despite 

her success in the strikeout 
column, the numbers do not 
come easy.

“I’ve been struggling getting 

behind in the count,” Betsa said. 
“That’s what I’m definitely going 
to work on this weekend, spinning 
the ball through the zone and 
getting ahead in the count.”

Abounader keeps tradition 
alive as St. Edward product

By MIKE PERSAK 

Daily Sports Writer

Junior 184-pounder Domenic 

Abounader has been one of 
the leaders for the Michigan 
wrestling team this season. The 
first-year captain is 20-1 on the 
season, climbing all the way to 
the No. 2 national ranking for his 
weight class. But for those who 
knew him in high school — when 
he won three state championships 
with St. Edward High School 
outside Cleveland — Abounader’s 
success comes as no surprise.

“The number one thing about 

Dom (is that) he’s about the most 
competitive kid I’ve ever been 
around,” said Abounader’s high 
school 
assistant 
coach, 
John 

Heffernan. “He wants to try to win 
everything. That kind of set him 
apart more than anything else.”

There was a time in the early 

2000s when you would look at 
the Wolverines’ roster and see 
St. Edward High School well-
represented. The private school 
in Lakewood, Ohio, produced 
some impressive wrestlers for 
Michigan, including two-time 
national champion Ryan Bertin 
and All-Americans Andy Hrovat 
and Mike Kulczycki.

Though that recruiting pipeline 

has started to die down recently, 
the Wolverines’ ears perked up 
when they heard Abounader’s 
name thrown around.

“Over the years, we’ve had 

a nice relationship with the St. 
Edward High School program,” 
said Michigan head coach Joe 
McFarland. “When Dom was 
in his early high school years, 
people were telling me to keep 
an eye on him. So we just started 
following him, and it worked out 
really well for us.”

Of course, a wrestler like 

Abounader wasn’t easy to catch. 
He had multiple offers from 
Division I schools, so the “nice 
relationship” the Wolverines have 
with St. Edward gave them a hand 
with Abounader’s recruitment.

“Mike Kulczycky actually … 

came back and started helping 
St. Edward’s,” Abounader said. 
“He knew that Michigan was on 
my radar, and if I had questions, 
he would answer my questions. 
But he ultimately let me make my 
decision for me.

Since the commitment, there 

have been a series of close calls 
for Abounader that have kept 
him from making it all the way 
to the top of his division. In his 
freshman year, he finished with a 
16-11 record overall, losing a close 

match in the first round of the 
NCAA Championships.

In 
his 
sophomore 
year, 

Abounader finished 22-8 but was 
eliminated in the second round of 
the NCAA Championships after 
another close match.

Even though his one loss this 

year came to the only wrestler 
ranked ahead of him in his 
weight class — Cornell’s Gabe 
Dean — the big junior believes he 
has found himself since that loss, 
and now has what it takes to win 
the close matches that have felled 
him in the past.

It was this hard work that 

Abounader has been putting in 
that earned him the distinction of 
being named captain of the team.

“We like the way he approaches 

everything,” McFarland said. “He 
has a lot of grit and toughness to 
him, and we like that.”

With 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Championships starting March 
5 and the NCAA Championships 
on March 17, Abounader looks to 
put all of his hard work to good 
use in his attempt to defend his 
Big Ten title and add an national 
championship to his resume. If he 
does, just like all of his successes 
up to this point, it will come as 
no surprise to those who have 
followed him.

Michigan riding late 
wave of momentum 

Wolverines have 
won five of six 

entering regular-

season finale

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

When the Michigan women’s 

basketball team lost to then-No. 
17 Michigan State on Feb. 3, the 
Wolverines’ 
postseason 
path 
became 

fuzzier. Sitting 
below .500 in 
conference 
play, 
it 
was 

possible 
Michigan could 
finish as one 
of the bottom 
four teams in 
the Big Ten and 
would 
need 

compete in a 
play-in 
game 

to qualify for the conference 
tournament.

The Wolverines needed a 

bounceback, and luckily for 
them, they got it four days later 
with a victory against Illinois at 
Crisler Center.

It was the beginning of a 

seven-game stretch to close 
out Michigan’s regular season, 
one that would give a glimpse 
into what sort of damage the 
Wolverines could deal in the 
postseason. Every game in that 
schedule was a must-win.

But even if Michigan couldn’t 

entirely sweep the final stretch, 
sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty knew the implications 
of at least having a strong and 
meaningful finish.

“I think we really could 

win the Big Ten Tournament,” 
Flaherty said after beating the 
Fighting Illini, “and I think it’ll 
come down to if we go in there 
with momentum.”

Almost a month after that 

statement, the Wolverines (9-8 
Big Ten, 17-11 overall) are fifth in 
the conference standings, have 
won five out of their last six games 
and have only one game left 
against Rutgers before heading to 
Indianapolis for the conference 
tournament next week. 

Michigan is certainly riding 

a high wave of momentum with 
its only loss in the last month 
coming at No. 6 Maryland on 
Feb. 17, but even that game was 
a tight contest. The Wolverines’ 
hard-hitting defense put them 
in the lead for most of the game 
against a frantic Terrapin squad, 
and it was just down the stretch 
that the game slipped away.

As for Michigan’s top two 

scorers, Flaherty and freshman 
center 
Hallie 
Thome 
have 

been making huge strides this 
season to get the Wolverines in 
a position to win.

Flaherty has six 30-plus point 

games, and Thome has continued 
to be an effective rebounder 
under the glass — most recently 
helping Michigan to a 70-65 
victory at Northwestern.

But when Flaherty and Thome 

are on top of 
their game, it 
doesn’t always 
guarantee 
a 

win 
for 
the 

Wolverines. 
Instead, 
Michigan’s 
ideal 
output 

is a balanced 
attack. 
The 

other 
big 

impact players 
have been junior guard Siera 
Thompson 
and 
sophomore 

forward Jillian Dunston, who 
lead the team in assists and 
rebounds, respectively. 

For Michigan to continue the 

momentum that could carry it 
far into the Big Ten Tournament, 
that balanced team effort is 
going to need to be on display 
Sunday to pull off a victory at 

Rutgers, which would nicely 
cap off the Wolverines’ regular 
season going 6-for-7.

Though the Scarlet Knights, 

led by C. Vivian Stringer in her 
21st season in Piscataway, gave 
Michigan a headache last season 
by 
sweeping 
the 
two-game 

series, they are unranked this 
time around and sit below the 
Wolverines in the conference.

In 
the 
two 
teams’ 
only 

meeting this season, Rutgers 
(7-10, 16-13) could pack quite 
the punch for Michigan. Guard 
Tyler 
Scaife 
and 
forward 

Kahleah Copper are averaging a 
team-leading 17.2 and 17 points, 
respectively.

Sunday’s game may ultimately 

be decided by which team 
rebounds the ball better. Copper 
and center Rachel Hollivay have 
combined for 14.3 rebounds per 
game this year, compared to 
Thome and Dunston’s 11.2. The 
paint will be a war zone — a 
battle that the Wolverines can’t 
afford to lose.

With a win Sunday, Michigan 

could rest easy knowing it 
finished off the season in a 
respectable 
fashion. 
Next 

Thursday, the 
Wolverines 
will begin play 
at the Big Ten 
Tournament, 
where a deep 
run could put 
Michigan 
on 

the bubble for 
its first NCAA 
Tournament 
appearance in 
three years.

If not the Big Dance, the 

Wolverines would have another 
chance at earning a WNIT title, 
which they almost seized last 
season.

Sunday represents a crossroads 

for Michigan: lose and some of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
hard-earned 

momentum could vanish; win 
and they could see more than 
only one game next weekend.

Michigan’s DMR team: 
‘How did this happen?’

Four-man group 
recalls school-

record performance 

last weekend

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

Mike McGuire was standing 

at the finish line of the men’s 
distance medley relay. His arms 
were crossed, and he was staring 
at a stopwatch. He was chuckling. 

“Wait until you see how fast 

you ran,” said McGuire, the 
assistant coach of the Michigan 
women’s track and field team, to 
Mason Ferlic.

The fifth-year senior — who 

had just finished the anchor 
1,600-meter leg — had caught up 
to the lead runners and put the 
Wolverines in third place after 
the pack had trailed for most of 
the race.

“3:55,” McGuire said. 
Overhead on the board, the 

final time of 9:27.67 flashed. It 
was good enough to qualify for 
nationals and three seconds 
better than their goal of 9:30. 
And, even though nobody knew 
it at the time, they broke the 
school record made in 2004 
by national champions Nate 
Brennan, 
DarNell 
Talbert, 

Andrew 
Ellerton 
and 
Nick 

Willis. Both Brennan and Willis 
went on to be Olympians. 

All Ferlic could respond was, 

“How did this happen?” 

* * * 

In the Alex Wilson Invitational 

last weekend in South Bend, Ind., 
the Michigan distance medley 
relay team was run by, in order, 
sophomore 
Chase Barnett 
in the 1,200-
meter 
leg, 

fifth-year 
senior 
Phil 

Washington 
III in the 400-
meter segment, 
sophomore 
Brennan 
Munley in the 
800-meter portion and Ferlic. 

Originally, 
however, 

Washington was only considered 
an alternate. Freshman Taylor 
McLaughlin was set to run just 
that morning. 

“I actually came to the track 

in khakis and (Timberlands) 
so I was really not prepared to 
run,” Washington said. “But 
(McLaughlin) said, ‘Oh, I threw 
up this morning,’ so I was like, 
‘All right.’ I just started warming 
up with him, and throughout 
the warmup, he was filling me 
in and saying he felt queasy, but 
he wasn’t sure if it was nerves 
or not. So I told him to keep on 
warming up because this was a 
huge opportunity.

“(Assistant 
coach 
Kevin 

Sullivan) made the call 10 
minutes before (that I was 
running) and at that point I 
was freaking out. Outside I was 
like, ‘Yeah, I’m ready,’ but on the 
inside I was like, ‘Oh my god.’ ”

Washington — who has been 

plagued by injuries for the past 
two seasons — has been struggling 
to regain footing as a competitor 
for the Wolverines. Going into 
the meet, he was divided between 
cheering for his teammates and 
being disappointed in potentially 
only riding his teammate’s success 
to championship season without 
contributing. 

“I had to start stretching and 

doing some sprints,” Washington 
said. “Normally, I think about my 
race, but this was a lot different 
because I didn’t have to think. I 
just went right in, and when I got 
the baton, I kind of blanked out 
and just went for it.”

The rest of his teammates had 

the same “go for it,” attitude. 
Program 
history 
dictates 

Michigan has been a formidable 
opponent in the distance medley 
relay event, but Michigan coach 
Jerry Clayton and Sullivan had 
been wary of putting athletes in 
the event until this year. 

They were waiting for the 

right group of guys. 

“We needed to have the right 

athletes in place to make (the 

distance medley relay team),” 
Sullivan said. “We weren’t going 
to waste a race on the DMR. We 
just weren’t at that place last 
year. This has been, historically, 
a great event for track and field. 
We have some of the fastest 
times ever in the country. It has 
been a really important part 
of our program. We wanted to 
build until we had a team that 
had a group of guys ready to 
compete for nationals.” 

But this season’s distance 

medley relay team was not 
expecting to do anything but try 
to secure a spot in nationals.

In Michigan’s indoor training 

facility, a board that is hung 
up lists off the records. Every 
Wolverine dreams of having 
their name up there. 

“I remember 

looking at the 
board 
and 

seeing it and 
thinking there’s 
not a chance in 
hell we’re going 
to beat that,” 
Munley said. “I 
saw the names, 
and 
I 
didn’t 

even have to 

look at the times, I thought, ‘That’s 
not happening.’ ”

* * * 

Barnett started off the race 

with a split time of 2:56.9. He 
passed the baton to Washington 
last among his competitors. Yet 
it wasn’t the fact that he was 
doing poorly, it was just others 
were doing extremely well. 

Washington was able to pass a 

couple of guys after completing 
his leg in 47.5 seconds, but by 
the time the baton got to Munley 
for the third leg, the Wolverines 
were battling to stay relevant in 
the race. 

“We were either the second 

to last or last,” Munley said, 
who finished his leg in 1:47.3. 
“There were some really fast 
guys (in the first two legs). We 
were competing with guys that 
were top in the nation. I was 
hurting (in the last 200 meters), 
but I was trying to get the baton 
to (Ferlic). Once I did I was like, 
‘Let’s see what you can do, I 
tried my best.’ ”

The final leg, run by Ferlic, 

was where the distance medley 
relay team caught up to the 
lead 
pack. 
Not 
surprising, 

considering the laundry list of 
impressive performances he’s 
had over his collegiate career. 
His name is almost synonymous 
with Michigan track and field. 

Ferlic’s strategy was clear: 

eyes forward, pass competitors 
and go fast.

“Before I got the baton, I was 

worried,” Ferlic said. “I had a 
little bit of self-doubt because 
the guys who were anchoring 
the other DMRs were dedicated 
milers. I was hoping to run 
four flat. And if we were that 
far behind, the pressure was on 
to run just that much faster to 
catch these guys. I didn’t know 
if I was able to do that. But I 
figured that we were here and 
we had one shot and I can’t have 
negative thoughts before I get 
the baton because then we’re not 
going to be in it.”

Ferlic has been angling to run 

a sub-four mile for his entire 
collegiate career, coming away 
disappointed in the Iowa State 
Classic, where he achieved his 
standing personal best of 4:00.50. 

But, while Ferlic has run a 

1,600-meter race in 3:55, 1,600 
meters isn’t a mile — it’s nine 
meters short. And those nine 
meters mean a lot to Ferlic, 
who refuses, understandably, to 
count 3:55 as meeting his goal. 

“As soon as I finished in third 

I was like, ‘Damn that actually 
went pretty well,’ ” Ferlic said. 
 

“But I still didn’t know the time 
until I saw it flash on the board 
and I saw 9:27, and I was like, 
‘Holy crap, are you serious?’ ” 

According to Barnett, there 

were whispers that the time was 
close to the school record set 
more than a decade before — but 
no one was sure. 

It wasn’t until they were back 

at their “camp” at the meet that 
Sullivan thought to look up on 
his phone what the standing 
record was. And when he saw 
the result, the entire distance 
medley relay team was in shock. 

“In a DMR, the legs are so 

uneven you don’t really know 
where you are in the race or on 
the clock, so you don’t really get 
a sense of what you’re doing until 
after,” Barnett said. “We were 
still on this high that we didn’t 
only hit a national time, we hit 
a really good national time and 
then to come off that … there was 
a lot of hugging and yelling.”

* * * 

A lot of the success has been 

chalked up to a culture change 
on the team, partly due to the 
new coaching staff of Clayton 
and Sullivan in their third and 
second years, respectively. 

Sullivan, who also serves as 

the Michigan men’s cross country 
coach, is noted, especially, as 
transitioning the team to a 
more 
inclusive 
environment, 

stemming 
all 

the way back 
to training for 
cross country 
season. 

“As a fifth-

year 
senior, 

I’ve definitely 
been through 
a lot and I’ve 
definitely seen 
the team go 
from 
a 
last-

place, not-taken-seriously team 
in the Big Ten to now possibly 
contending for a top-three spot 
in the Big Ten,” Washington said. 

But according to both coaches 

and Munley, the captains of the 
team have also stepped up to the 
line and have instituted team 
bonding events like cookouts and 
movie outings. Other changes 
have included switching the 
location of the athletes’ lockers 
frequently to prevent cliques and 
a whiteboard in the locker room 
that lets the athletes keep track 
of each other’s goals. 

“You can literally go there, 

read it and have that connection 
with that person,” Washington 
said. “And if you see them in 
practice, you can encourage it.” 

Added 
Ferlic: 
“With 
that 

culture 
change 
of 
going 

toward excellence and having 
everyone on the team expected 
to contribute, it kind of just 
increased 
the 
competitive 

atmosphere among all pockets of 
athletes on the team. Everyone 
now wanted to do their part to 
help the team be good. I think 
it united the team in a common 
cause. Instead of it being certain 
guys or one event group is good 
and the other isn’t as good, we all 
wanted to do well and motivate 
each other.”

Within the four distance medley 

relay team members, especially, 
the sense of camaraderie is 
palpable. The group joked that in 
15 years, they’re still going to be 
calling each other up asking how 
they are. 

Because, according to Barnett, 

“it’s a lifelong thing.”

“To look up on the board 

that’s up there right now and see 
the names that are up there, it’s 
pretty special to have a part in 
it,” Barnett said. “It’s special to 
be more of a piece (of the team), 
not just someone who was here, 
but someone who did something. 
I still have goals for the next 
couple years and stuff to get 
done. But it’s cool to actually 
leave that mark.”

And, 
according 
to 

Washington, they’re “tight.”

Unabashedly, 
the 
quarter 

informally thinks of themselves 
as a “misfit crew.”

* * * 

Despite the high the four 

have been riding, there’s no 
denying that the NCAA Indoor 
Championships, where they’ll run 
the distance medley relay again, 
looms large. The competition 
will take place March 11 and 12 in 
Birmingham, Ala. 

But if Clayton and Sullivan, 

particularly, have taught their 
team anything, it’s that each 
race 
should 
be 
approached 

individually and you can’t “make 
a race bigger than it is.” Sullivan 

preaches that 
no 
matter 

the 
setting, 

the 
distance 

medley 
relay 

will 
still 

always 
be 

4,000 meters. 

“I 
know 

at 
nationals, 

when 
I 
get 

the baton, I’m 
going to run 

until my legs break,” Munley said. 
“I have to do it for these guys 
because they’re working just as 
hard as I am for it. You never know 
what could happen, anything 
could happen on any given day. 
But I have to do my best and strive 
for my hardest, and maybe some 
good will come out of it.” 

It’s going to take a lot 

of practice, but nothing is 
impossible 
anymore. 
The 

four Wolverines have already 
displaced 
four 
national 

champions overlapped with two 
Olympians. 

“I don’t think people expected 

us four,” Washington said.

“We’re this weird dream team 

— we just ran faster,” Ferlic said. 

And nobody on the distance 

medley relay team is exactly sure 
how they did it.

Junior forward Alex Kile scored a hat trick in Thursday’s win at Minnesota.

Kile’s hat trick 
lifts Michigan 
over Gophers

By MAX BULTMAN 

Managing Sports Editor

MINNEAPOLIS — For the 

better part of two and a half 
periods, the Michigan hockey 
team 
was 

locked 
in a tight 
contest befitting of a series 
that could decide the Big Ten’s 
regular-season champion.

But with a furious scoring 

run late in the third period, the 
Wolverines cruised to a 6-2 win 
over Minnesota at Mariucci Arena 
on 
Thursday, 

vaulting 
into 

first place in 
the conference 
standings. 
Junior forward 
Alex 
Kile 

notched a hat 
trick 
with 

one 
goal 
in 

each 
period, 

and 
freshman 

forward Kyle Connor added two 
goals of his own in the win.

For a 6-2 game, though, 

Thursday’s contest was hardly 
electric for the first two periods.

Michigan struck first when 

Kile capitalized on a turnover 
from 
Minnesota 
defenseman 

Ryan Collins directly in front of 
the Golden Gophers’ net. Collins 
lost control of the puck while 
surveying the ice in front of him, 
and Kile made him pay, burning 
Minnesota goalie Eric Schierhorn 
on a bang-bang play.

“That’s a tough play,” Kile said. 

“Sometimes the ice gets chippy, 
and the puck just kind of rolled 
off his stick. Kind of feel bad for 
(Collins), but the puck was right in 
the slot and I just faked backhand, 
went forehand, and it actually hit 
off his stick into the net.”

It was a big break for the 

Wolverines, who finished the 
period with a 9-6 edge in shots 
on goal but were able to cash in 
only once.

The second period was a 

different story. Minnesota came 
out firing, outshooting Michigan, 
8-1, in the first eight minutes of the 
second despite missing on a pair of 
nifty chances directly in front of 
senior goalie Steve Racine.

“We knew they were going to 

come out hard,” Racine said. “I 
think the first might have been 
one of our better periods all year, 
and they hadn’t played in a little 
while, so I think they were just 
getting their legs under them.

“We did a good job weathering 

the storm.”

Racine kept Michigan steady 

all game, stopping 31 of 33 shots 
and preserving a slim lead while 
the Wolverines’ offense tried to 
get going.

Minnesota’s 
Justin 
Kloos 

and Darian Romanko both had 
chances to tie the game early in 
the second, but Racine stoned 
Romanko with a big left-pad save, 
and Kloos couldn’t thread the 
needle while streaking to the net 
from the right boards.

The 
Wolverines 
weathered 

the Golden Gophers’ storm until 

their offense capitalized on its 
first big chance of the period. 
With Michigan on a power play 
12:22 into the period, Kile tapped 
home his second of the day off 
a rebound from junior forward 
Tyler Motte — whose goal streak 
ended Thursday at 12 games. 
Schierhorn poked the puck away 
from Motte as he neared the goal, 
but it went straight to the waiting 
stick of Kile, who roofed it to give 
Michigan a two-goal lead.

“He’s one of our gifted scorers,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson. “The thing I like about 

him 
is 
he 

scored 
those 

blue-paint 
goals. 
Like 

where did all 
those 
goals 

come 
from? 

Right 
near 

the 
crease, 

right in tight, 
rebound, 
second-

effort goals. That’s where you’re 
sticking your nose into the danger 
areas and you’re paying the price 
to score goals.”

Going into the break, Michigan 

still held that lead, but the final 
outcome was hardly decided.

That changed sharply halfway 

through the third period. With 
9:49 left, a fight broke out deep in 
the Minnesota end. Michigan’s 
Brendan 
Warren 
and 
Justin 

Selman were sent off for roughing 
after the whistle, and Minnesota’s 
Nick Seeler and Jack Glover were 
awarded matching penalties. But 
Glover was also given a penalty 
for cross-checking, giving the 
Wolverines a man advantage.

Michigan made the most of the 

power play, going up 3-0 when 
junior 
forward 
JT 
Compher 

found Connor all alone on the 
right side of the crease for an easy 
goal with 8:06 to play.

Kile added his third tally of the 

game with just over five minutes 
remaining, tapping in a rebound 
for his 14th of the season, and 
junior 
forward 
Max 
Shuart 

scored another with just under 
four minutes left. Then, with 
2:58 to play, Connor got loose on 
a breakaway, beating Schierhorn 
to go up 6-0.

Moments 
later, 
Minnesota 

defenseman 
Steve 
Johnson 

scored the Golden Gophers first 
goal of the game, ending Racine’s 
bid for a shutout. Michigan’s 
defense collapsed with the huge 
lead, and Tommy Novak scored 
for Minnesota again with 1:32 
left to spoil an otherwise strong 
outing from Racine.

The Wolverines were more 

than happy to emerge with the 
conference lead, regardless of 
the lost shutout.

“This wasn’t a 6-2 game,” 

Berenson 
said. 
“Certainly, 
it 

could have been a different game 
had Steve Racine had not made 
some key saves at key times in the 
game. … I just thought the score 
didn’t indicate the game. They’re 
a better team than that, and we 
were lucky at times, and our 
goalie had to make a difference.”
