CONSTRUCTION ON CAMPUS
Student Vision Retreat seeks input
to renovate unions, sports facilities

Campus leaders
brainstorm ways to
improve buildings
By JENNIFER LEE
Daily StaffReporter
Future generations of University stu-
dents may soon reap the benefits of reno-
vated buildings and student spaces if a
vision by campus leaders and University
officials to drastically improve campus
buildings becomes reality.
A group of student leaders, University
officials and architecture consultants

from around the nation gathered on Sat-
urday for a Student Vision Retreat - an
event held to discuss ways to improve
the University's unions and recreational
sports facilities before the University's
bicentennial in 2017.
Saturday's discussion marked the
beginningofa phase ofstudentinput that
is being facilitated by Michigan Student
Assembly President DeAndree Watson
and student leaders. After evaluating
student feedback, the Division of Student
Affairs intends to draft a plan for the
design, construction and funding of the
renovations.
At the start of the discussions, Watson
encouraged students to incorporate their

experience on campus into the vision for
improving buildings such as the Michi-
gan Union, Michigan League and Pier-
pont Commons.
"Think about what issues exist today
and how a student would respond to
those 20 to 30 years from now (and) what
should be in place for these students to
have a worthwhile campus experience
for the future," Watson said.
Loren Rullman, associate vice presi-
dent for student affairs, attended the
retreat and said he has been evaluating
the conditions of buildings on campus for
the past few years to determine potential
renovations that could enhance student

MSU marches against racism

Campus Clubs Photos of the Week
I EMERSONIAN RETREAT

In response to hate crimes at
Michigan State University, several
hundred MSU students silently
marched last Thursday near cam-
pus to end racism, according to
an Oct. 7 Lansing State Journal
article.
The participants carried signa
that read messages such as "Love
knows no colors" as they walked
from the Brody Complex to Akers
Hall, the article reports.
Organizers said the march
was in response to recent events
on campus involving a racial slur
written on a white hoard and an
African-American doll found
hanging from a ceiling. The uni-
versity addressed the incidents
early in the week at a town hall

meeting, according to the Lansing LION TRANQUILIZED AT

sex, hugs and handjobs," Heifer's
piece already had 300 comments,
according to an Oct. 7 article in
College Media Matters.
Heifer's article received hoth
praise and criticism for the subject
matter.

A mountain lion was tran-
quilized last Wednesday after
it took residence in a tree near a
residence hall on campus at the
University of Colorado Boulder,
according to an Oct. 5 article in
the Boulder Daily Camera.
The article reported that
the lion was about four feet
long and was estimated to be
between 1 and 2 years old. After
the sedatives took effect, the
cat was removed from the tree
and released in a more suitable
location. No one was harmed in
the incident.

A series of bike lanes stretch-

three neighborhoods has joined
Detroit's popular RiverWalk and
Dequindre Cut to make parts of
the city more accessible to bicy-
clists.
The Greenlink project allows
riders to travel more safely
through parts of Southwest

It also is the first large scale
segment of the city's Urban Non-

"Detroit has a strong bicycle

SACRAMENTO, Calif.
California becomes
first state to ban
tanning for minors
California has become the first
state to make it illegal for teenag-
ers under 18 to use tanning beds.
Gov. Jerry Brown said yester-
day that he has signed SB746 into
law. It goes into effect Jan. 1.
Currently, children 14 and
under cannot use tanning beds
in California. Children ages 15-17
can tan with their parents' per-
mission.
The bill's author, state Sen.
Ted Lieu, says California is the
first state to set a higher age limit.
Texas has the next highest age
limit, banning tanning bed use by
teenagers under 16.
Lieu says 30 other states also
have some age restrictions on the
use.
ANCHORAGE, Ala.
Alaskan volcano
threat increases
Lava has reached the edge of
a crater in a volcano in Alaska's
remote Aleutian Islands, indicat-
ing the mountain could explode
and send up an ash cloud that
could threaten aircraft.
The Alaska Volcano Observa-
tory says satellite images show
lava at the edge of the crater rim
of 5,675-foot Cleveland Mountain
on uninhabited on Chuginadak
Island, about 940 miles southwest
of Anchorage.
Volcano monitors say if the
dome continues to grow, it could
overflow the rim and increase the
possibility of an explosion.
The observatory says an erup-
tion could send up an ash cloud
20,000 feet or more.
The nearest village, Nikolski, is
on another island about 50 miles

east and has 18 permanent resi-
dents. The village was not con-
sidered in harm's way in previous
eruptions of the volcano.
ANKARA, Turkey
Smugglers release
bees in attack on
Turkish police
A Turkish news agency says
suspected smugglers set loose a
swarm of bees on 15 police offi-
cers searching for contraband
cigarettes hidden among a truck-
load of hives.
The state-run Anatolia agen-
cy says police, acting on a tip,
stopped the truck in the south-
ern city of Adana yesterday. The
alleged smugglers then set some
of the bees free to prevent police
from searching the vehicle.
There was no information on
the officers' conditions.
The agency said the truck was
later searched by officers in bee-
keeping gear who seized some
32,500 packs of smuggled ciga-
rettes.
The truck driver and two bee-
keepers were arrested.

VISION
From Page 1A
life.
As a part of the process, the
University has conducted numer-
ous surveys and focus groups,
collaborated with consultants
and sent representatives to tour
other universities around the
nation for inspiration on how to
design the buildings.
Rullman said duringthe event
that while the University values
strengthening academic pro-
grams and initiatives, it also plac-
es importance on enhancing the
campus atmosphere to meet the
increasing needs of the growing
student body.
"We are totally committed to
the student experience," he said.
"We know that what happens
in the classroom is critical, but
we also happen to believe that
the learning, the experience, the
interactions we have outside the
classroom is really what defines
and creates the Michigan experi-
ence."
During the event, planners
and architects from consultant
groups that have been working
with the University on poten-
tial renovation plans shared
their designs with students and
encouraged feedback on their
ideas.
Greg Havens, planner and
architect for Sasaki Associates in
Watertown, MA., presented the
results of a recreational sports
study, which identified poten-
tial improvements for the three
recreational facilities at the Uni-
versity - the Central Campus
Recreation Building, the Intra-
mural Sports Building and the
North Campus Recreation Build-
ing.
The study calls for the

improvement and expansion of
outdoor field space with upgrad-
ed turf, revitalization of the
Intramural Sports Building and
a focus on student and faculty
well-being and fitness.
The study also highlighted
the lack of space in the Univer-
sity's gyms and sports facilities.
With over 41,000 students cur-
rently enrolled, the designs of
the facilities allot six square feet
per student. However, the indus-
try standard is eight to 10 square
feet per student, according to the
study.
Haven proposed adding
134,000 square feet to the facili-
ties, with about 84 percent, or
112,560 square feet, of the total
additional space allocated to
the North Campus Recreational
Building and the remaining por-
tion to the Central Campus Rec-
reational Building.
At the retreat, Public Policy
senior Nina Bhattacharya voiced
her concern about the lack of
dance spaces at the University's
gym facilities. As a member of
the Maya Dance Team, she said
her team frequently has to prac-
tice in front of the posting hall
in Angell Hall and use the win-
dows as makeshift mirrors.
A University Unions study
- presented by the Milwaukee-
based firm Workshop Architects
- found that the League, Pier-
pont Commons and the Union
were lacking spaces that inte-
grate student needs such as all-
purpose dining, socializing and
studying.
Jan van den Kieboom, owner
and lead architect of Workshop
Architects, commented on the
quiet atmosphere that most peo-
ple encounter when first enter-
ing the main doors in the Union,
which he said contrasts with
bustling student unions at other

universities.
To remedy this and other
outdated features, the Univer-
sity Unions study recommended
transforming the main floor to
create a more engaging area for
students, completely renovating
the building's lower level and
turning the outdoor courtyard
into a glass atrium and perfor-
mance space while keeping the
history and unique architecture
intact.
Both studies also drew atten-
tion to the opportunity North
Campus presents in improving
student life facilities, largely due
to the physical space available
on North Campus.
Van den Kieboom specifically
noted the diverse and artistic
atmosphere of North Campus
and the need for a common
building that more succinctly
brings students from an array of
disciplines together.
"North Campus has got this
kind of funky ethos of creativity
and a need to be revitalized with
a kind of building that would
really draw students, that has
strong destination qualities,"
Van den Kieboom said. "We see
Pierpont Commons as having
a real opportunity to do some-
thing completely different than
what we now have."
In an interview after the
event, Rullman said he felt
the students were enthusias-
tic and dedicated to creating a
better student experience for
the future generations of stu-
dents. He said he was especially
impressed with their response
since many of them will not be
here when the renovations actu-
ally take place.
"I was really impressed with
that sense of legacy and tradi-
tion and responsibility," Rul-
lman said.

DENARD
From Page 1A
Wildcats stacked the box, daring
him to throw the ball. Robinson
saw it on tape, so he knew he'd
have to win the game with his
arm.
"That was our plan," said
Northwestern coach Pat
Fitzgerald. "He's gonna throw
the ball up there for you. We got
three picks, we should've had at
least five."
'Six games into the season,
the formula is set - Michigan's
offense relies solely on Robin-
son. Defenses like Northwest-
ern's are going to make him
throw the ball to beat them. The
rest is up to the internal struggle
of the 6-foot-1, 193-pound junior
quarterback from Deerfield
Beach, Fla. - who'll win: Good
Denard or Bad Denard?
This is the question Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke has to
answer over the final six games
of the season. How often we see
Good Denard is the difference
between one of the best college
football players ever to play the
game and a talented athlete
whose legs bought him glory.
Good or Bad, he is the begin-
ning, middle and end of the
Michigan offense.
Good Denard steps into his
throws, firing bullets between
defenders.
In one instance, he hit
Hemingway near the sideline
with a laser, splitting zone cov-
erage, then threw a perfect slant
to Jeremy Gallon.
On the next play, with plenty
of time to make a better throw
or decision, Bad Denard stepped
into his pass and sailed it way
over Hemingway's head for his
third interception of the half.
Earlier, ina display of bril-
liance, Good Denard hit
Hemingway on a beautiful
pass, throwing the ball before
Hemingway made his last cut
towards the sideline.
The next play, Bad Denard
threw off his back foot, letting it
go before Hemingway finished
his route. Interception.
The next drive, Bad Denard
stepped up to run, then decided
to throw the ball to Vincent
Smith. But he didn't set his feet
and lofted a pass into double
coverage for an interception in
the redzone.
Fighting to find Good Denard,
Borges sits Robinson down after
plays like that: "What did you
see? No, what did you actually
see?"
Down 24-14 at halftime,
Michigan's defense hadn't fared
much better, but the offense
could've pointed its finger
squarely at Bad Denard.
"Well the coaches and the
players, all of us look at each
other (at halftime) and we know

we're goingto hold each other
accountable," Robinson said.
That includes Bad Denard.
With his teammates chirp-
ing in his ear, with his coaches
calming him down, Good
Denard started the second half
with two-straight completions
to Roy Roundtree, including a
57-yard bomb. Northwestern
was put on notice - the game
was again in Good Denard's
hands.
Michigan scored touchdowns
on four of its five second-half
drives, and Robinson completed
7-of-8 passes for 139 yards.
"I did alright in the second
half," Robinson said after Good
Denard beat Northwestern
42-24. "Started stepping into the
throws like I'm supposed to, like
coach told me to."
Such is the case of Robinson's
season.
Fully aware of the battle
between Good and Bad Denard,
Robinson said he started Sat-
urday's game with that same
fluttery excitement that built up
before he played under the lights
in week two on a national stage
versus Notre Dame, a heated
rival.
"Oh yeah, this is a Big Ten
game," Robinson said. "We're
trying to win the Big Ten - so
yeah.
"I guess I get too excited. I
just need to calm down."
When he does, his arm is as
dangerous as his legs, which
accounted for 117 yards, includ-
ing two 25-yard runs in the sec-
ond half. His legs have scared
the whole Big Ten into game-
planning against them.
How good could he be if he
routinely sets his feet, makes
the right decision and takes
advantage of the one-on-one
opportunities defenses are
spoon-feeding him?
What if his arm was just as
dangerous as his legs, like in
Saturday's second-half?
"I'm not quite sure they made
a whole lot of (halftime) adjust-
ments," Fitzgerald said.
"A young man named Denard
Robinson - he's pretty good. A
pretty good player. The best that
we've seen in a while. He was
outstanding."
This was said about aruarter-
back who threw three intercep-
tions, yet created 454 total yards
of offense - the third highest
total of his already storied
career.
Was he the hero? The goat?
Or both?
For Michigan, as long as Bad
Denard lingers, victories and
games like these should feel
cheapened, as simply signs of
how legendary its star quarter-
back could be.

members, and two of the eight
positions will be up for re-elec-
tion during the state-wide elec-
tion next November.
Horning said there is alack of
tolerance for the conservative
minority on the board, and he
hopes that with strong candi-
dates, Republicans can gain the
power to make decisions at the
University.
"It's critical that we get two
great candidates that can win a
year from now, because the first
thing we can do is lock it up, and
then the second thing we can do
two years from now is take con-
trol," Horning said.
Horning said that when he
held his position on the board,
he did not agree with the board's
decision to provide health ben-
efits for same-sex couples, and
he still does not approve.
"I wasn't against it because
I'm a gay-basher, I was against
it because I'm a fiscal conserva-
tive, and it doesn't make sense
to spend expenditures for ben-
efits for one group of people that
you're not doing for another," he
said.
Additionally, Horning said

he is against affirmative action
and the University's decision
to allow Graduate Student
Research Assistants to union-
ize. If elected, he would like
to institute a flat tuition plan
in which University students
would pay the same amount per
credit hour for all four years.
Bill Kauffman, a former Uni-
versity professor of aerospace
engineering, spoke about the
need for increased transparency
at the University.
Kauffman said he would hire
someone to audit the Univer-
sity's finances, which he alleges
has not been done since the
1980s.
Kauffman added that if he
were elected, he would propose
a policy in which the top 10 per-
cent of Michigan high school
students would be automatically
accepted to the University.
"It's your university, and you
have the right to get in. There
have to be limits on out-of-state
and out-of-country enroll-
ments," Kauffman said.
The next candidate to speak
was Doug Smith, a former assis-
tant clinical professor, who is a
University undergraduate and
Medical School alum. He echoed
Kauffman's sentiments that it is
too difficult for in-state students

to be accepted to the University,
adding that financial aid funding
should be prioritized to students
from Michigan.
"We need to make sure that
qualified students from the state
of Michigan are enrolled, and we
need to make sure that the finan-
cial aid that's available doesn't
get spent on the out-of-state and
foreign-born students," Smith
said.
In an interview after the
event, Smith said even though
his views are conservative, he
doesn't identify with a political
party and considers most of the
issues discussed at the meeting
to be non-partisan.
"Oversight, following the
rules and engaging in protect-
ing the future of the University
- I don't see that as Republican
or Democrat at all," Smith said.
"The people on the extremes
prevent the problems from get-
ting fixed."
Kauffman said in an inter-
view after the event that a new
administration is needed at the
University in order to change its
priorities.
"We're taking on the estab-
lishment," Kauffman said. "I
know the deficiencies at U of M,
and I think I know the correc-
tions."

No deaths reported
in suicide bombing
and rocket fire
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
A suicide bomber and rocket fire
struck U.S.-run outposts near
the Pakistani border as the war
in Afghanistan hit the 10-year
mark Friday. The Afghan presi-
dent said there will be no end to
the war until militants can no
longer operate freely in Paki-
stan.
No deaths were reported
among U.S. service members at
the three outposts in Paktika
province, and it was unclear if
the attacks were timed to coin-
cide with the anniversary of the
start of the war. But the contin-
ued violence was a reminder of
the resilience of the insurgency,
which thrives in part because of
sanctuaries in Pakistan.
A suicide bomber detonated a
vehicle packed with explosives
near the entrance to Combat
Outpost Margah, which had
also been hit with 22 rockets,
accordingto an Associated Press

reporter at the scene. Combat
Forward Operating Base Till-
man was hit with a half-dozen
rockets and Forward Operating
Base Boris was struck with two.
In Washington, President
Barack Obama noted the anni-
versary in a quiet style, offering a
written statement and holding no
publicevents to mark the moment.
He said the United States is safer
thanks to the sacrifice of troops,
diplomats and intelligence ana-
lysts during the war.
Obama saluted the more than
1,700 U.S. troops who have died,
along with the coalition and
Afghan forces killed. He said
that because of the effort, "our
citizens are safer and our nation
is more secure."
Afghan President Hamid
Karzai claimed the Taliban are
being propped up by Pakistan,
saying the militants can't lift a
finger without the Pakistanis.
The war will only end when
something is done to rout insur-
gents from their sanctuaries
across the border in Pakistan,
Karzai said in an interview with
the BBC that aired on Friday,
exactly 10 years after the U.S.

and its allies invaded Afghani-
stan on Oct. 7, 2001.
The invasion was aimed at
toppling the hard-line Taliban
regime and punishing it for
giving safe harbor to al-Qaida,
which orchestrated the Sept.
11 attacks on the United States.
Over the years, the U.S.-led
coalition became mired in a bat-
tle against insurgents who have
been weakened by international
troops yet continue to plant
bombs and stage suicide attacks
and assassinations of top Afghan
figures.
"Definitely, the Taliban will
not be able to move a finger with-
out Pakistani support," Karzai
said. "The fact is the Taliban
were and are stationed, in terms
of their political headquarters
and operational headquarters,
in Pakistan. We all know that.
The Pakistanis know that. We
know that."
Militant sanctuaries in Paki-
stan won't go away unless the
government of Pakistan cooper-
ates with Afghanistan and the
international community finds
an effective way to remove the
hide-outs, he said.

FROM THE PUBLIC EDITOR I
Unsigned editorials

EDITOR IN CHIEF

MICHELLE DEWITT
and EMILY ORLEY
EDITORIAL PAGE EDITORS

NICK SPAR
MANAGING EDITOR

Unsigned editorials reflect the official position of the Daily's editorial board.
All other signed articles and illustrations represent solely the views ofttheir authors.
FROM T HE DA sIY
Transform train travel
Federal grant would connect the Midwest
Wbile a high-speed rail is still a distant fantasy for Mich-
igan, a higher-speed rail is in the foreseeable future.
The Michigan Department of Transportation recently
received a $196.5 million federal grant to be used for the construc-
tion of a high-speed train line. The grant will improve public transit
in the state and has the potential to build commerce and generate
revenue throughout the Midwest.

Two editorials (known at
The Michigan Daily as
"leftsides") that appeared
on the Daily's opinion page in
recent days caught my attention,
and I think provide a good oppor-
tunity for a larger discussion about
this paper's unsigned leftsides and
the editorial voice behind them.
Before I even dive into the
substance of this discussion, it's
important to clear up a couple of
preliminary issues that I think are
often misunderstood. Unsigned
editorials represent the stance of
the Daily as an institution upon a
given issue. They are voted on and
drafted by members of the Daily's
editorial board, which any Univer-
sity student can join, upon meeting
certain staff requirements.
The ultimate authority to deter-
mine the content of leftsides rests
with the editorial page editor(s),
who are elected in a staff-wide
election specifically because that
position involves speaking for the
paper as an institution. The Daily
is unusual in that it does allow the
editor in chief to have some edito-
rial oversight over the opinion page.
However, should there ever be a
conflict between the two compet-
ing authorities, the editor in chief
should defer to the editorial page
editor as to the content of leftsides.
In the first of the two lefts-
ides that inspired this discussion
(From the Daily: The right to choose,
09/26/2011), the Daily took a largely
predictable, liberal stance on an
individual's right to late-term abor-
tions. Curiously, however, the left-
side used the phrase "partial-birth
abortion" to describe the proce-
dure. In fact, that phrase - which
is an inflammatory concoction of
opponents of late-term abortion
and is generally avoided by those
who support the procedure - was
used 10 times in the leftside.
In the second leftside, (From the
Daily: Problematic panhandling,

09/27/2011), the Daily expressed
frustration at the presence and
prevalence of "aggressive" panhan-
dlers. Alarmed, the Daily's editorial
board advised that "police should
be patrolling downtown Ann Arbor
and enforcing panhandling policies
in order to protect businesses and
encourage commerce."
Reading both leftsides initially
made me uncomfortable, and feed-
back received from other readers
confirmed a lot of my own feel-
ings. Importantly, however, my
own reaction was tempered by an
understanding of the exceptionally
difficult task it is to write a leftside,
and I hope to impart some of that
understanding.
I served as the Daily's editorial
page editor nearly five years ago,
so maybe that makes me a biased
commentator, but nevertheless, I
have always believed that leftsides
are harder to write than anything
else in the Daily. Synthesizing the
opinions of the editorial board,
reconciling that synthesis with the
precedent that embodies the Daily
institutional voice and ultimately
crafting a competent defense of that
position is a challenge faced by the
editorial page editors each day -
and largely unappreciated by read-
ers or even other Daily staffers.
Recalling my own experience,
I used to spend easily two or three
hours each night rewriting leftsides
that had already been drafted by a
writer and edited by an associate
editor. I considered it important
to present a strong, principled and
nuanced editorial, and regardless
of what others may have written,
it was ultimately my job to ensure
that the final product was as near
perfect as possible.
The Daily's institutional voice -
an unbridled advocate of students'
rights and a progressive world view
- often demands a viewpoint that
is easyto sell to the largely progres-
sive University community. But

nuance and responsiveness to real-
ity are important to maintain, and
they are easily ignored on a campus
like this one. Very few readers are
skeptical to the leftist viewpoint
this page generally takes, and that
can invite complacency.
It's clear to me that both leftsides
discussed above could have used
more refinement. Using the term
"partial-birth abortion" doesn't
help propel the Daily's position on
late-term abortion. Indeed, the left-
side should have pointed out the
politically charged nature of that
term and avoided it in favor of the
more accurate and less inflamma-
tory"late-term abortion."As for the
panhandling leftside, the Daily's
institutional voice wouldn't sup-
port more police patrols to enforce
panhandlinglaws. Instead, it would
argue that the University commu-
nity shouldn't allow recent crimes
in the community to become an
excuse to single out and target a
socially and politically vulnerable
group like panhandlers.
That said, I recognize that it's
easy to sit back and second-guess
any number of points made in lefts-
ides. It is incredibly difficult to write
a good leftside, and the editorial
page should always expect criticism
- much of it unfair. The only thing
that the editorial page editorscan do
is to scrutinize every little detail of
the opinions expressed in a leftside,
and ensure that enough efforts are
made to thinkthings through.
The voice of the Daily is a vital
asset to this paper's credibility, and
it deserves every lastbit of attention
on every production night.
-The public editor is on independent
critic of the Daily, and neither the editorial
board nor the editor in chief exercise
control over the contents of his columns.
The opinions expressed do not necessarily
constitute the opinion of the Daily.

The grant will fund the engineering,
design and construction of the train that
will travel at 110 miles per hour. Michigan is
using $140 million to build 135 miles of train
tracks. The goal is to ease traffic congestion,
decrease delays and improve reliability in an
effort to attract more passengers. The money
will also be put toward improving safety
and signals for the existing train that runs
between Detroit and Kalamazoo.
The improvements will be made to the
existing train lines connecting Detroit and
Chicago. The two cities are vital hubs in
the Midwest, and making transportation
between them easier and faster is essential to
growing the economy and encouraging com-
merce between the two cities.
Advancements on American train travel
have lagged behind travel throughout Asia
and Europe, which have functioning high-
speed rail lines. In March, Chicago made
substantial advancements on a high-speed
line that connects to St. Louis, and build-
ing a route to Detroit is the next logical step.
Prompt and efficient train travel is essential
for encouraging people to use trains as an
alternative to other forms of transportation.
Improvements to existing tracks and
building more tracks are an important
investment in Michigan's infrastructure.
The development will also make Detroit and

the state more attractive for businesses as
well as prospective residents because Detroit
will be connected to other major cities.
With growing concerns about the nation's
environmental impact, the use of mass
transit is more important than ever. Public
transportation such as trains and buses are
more eco-friendly options than automobiles.
Making train travel more appealing than
driving is necessary to help citizens make
eco-friendly choices that are also friendly to
their wallets and schedules.
The construction of the project is also
goingto have economic benefits. The Depart-
ment of Transportation estimated that 800
workers will be hired to work on the develop-
ment, which will help put Michigan residents
back to work.
While many Americans are concerned
about government spending, this is the type
of investment that will make the country and
state stronger. Investments in infrastructure
and projects that create jobs are crucial for
rebuilding the economy in both the short-
term and the long-term.
Improvements to public transportation
systems throughout the state should be
encouraged. The government at the state
and federal level should continue to support
similar ventures that help rebuild Michigan,
economically and structurally.

'Boy Meets World' writers
thank The Michigan Daily
TO THE DAILY:
I wanted to thank Proma Khosla for the
fun Boy Meets World piece (From the vault:
The teen love and bromance of 'Boy Meets
World,' 9/28/2011).
I received my M.A. degree in telecommu-
nication arts from the University in the mid-
80s. A few years later, I found myself writing
for "Boy Meets World." All told, I wrote
about 20 episodes and served as one of the
show's producers.
Every word in your piece was wonderful
and true. Even your subtle criticisms were
accurate. Believe me, no one laughed harder
Don't select Tina Fey as 'U'
commencement speaker
TO THE DAILY:
Though Tina Fey would make for an
"entertaining" commencement speaker, no
doubt, I don't believe she would have some-
thing inspiring to share with the graduating
class, nor do I believe that she has contrib-
uted anything truly meaningful to society or
impacted our lives in any significant way.
Yes, Fey has become very successful, and
is an amazing comedian, butI believe at this
point in the University's history, the focus
has shifted toward technology and entre-
preneurship. Just look at President Mary
Sue Coleman's address to the campus this
past Tuesday where she announced that the
University will be investing $25 million in its

at the show's inconsistencies than us. And
the comedic moments you mentioned were
Writers' Room favorites, too.
We are proud of the show - it had a good
heart. I spoke to the other writers, including
Michael Jacobs, the creator and executive
producer. Here are Michael's words:
"I am grateful for Proma's appreciation
of what we tried to do, which was mostly
to offer indelible moments about important
values, and what separated us is that the dia-
logue was on a level that spoke up to our audi-
ence and never pandered. The audience had
to think sometimes, and that was the best
thing we did for them."
Thank you, thank you.

own start-ups. I believe that Michigan needs
to highlight this, and in a big way by bringing
one of the premiere entrepreneurs to cam-
pus. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg not
only exemplifies this aspect of the University,
but he has created a tool we all use every sin-
gle day and has fundamentally changed the
way we communicate.
The other argument being made is that we
have not had a woman be the commencement
speaker at the University for a couple of years.
While that is true (though, is five years really
that much?), is it really a worthy argument?
In today's world, where women are becoming
more and more successful, some even say more
so than men, dowe really need to discriminate
anymore? Gender shouldn't be a factor when it
comes to choosing a commencement speaker.

"Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes
along that changes everything." That's a quote from
Steve Jobs when he announced the iPhone back in early
2007. It was the third time he had revolutionized a piece
of technology and most certainly would not be his last.
People call him the "Edison of our time," a "genius,"
a "true visionary," some are even calling him "God."
To me, he was an inspiration, someone who, until last
Wednesday, would not even let death stop him from
doing what he loved - making technology that not
only changed the way we do things, but also changed
the way we view the world. Here was a man who, back
in 2004, was told by doctors that he had just three -to
six months to live. Imagine if they were right. Phones
would still have clunky keyboards and tiny screens, and
"apps" would be an unknown word. Tablets would still
be those awkward laptops with the screens that twisted
and folded down (gasp!), and "pinching to zoom" would
be a foreign concept.
Now, you could argue that others had invented some
of these technologies, or that Jobs had these products
in the pipeline way before his death. Truth is, no could
sell them like El Jobso. Apple is, and always has been,
the only company whose product announcements I fol-
low with absolute scrutiny and excitement. Every key-
note, every "one more thing," is like unwrapping that
last gift during the holidays. Each time he unearths
the next great iDevice from underneath the sleek black
clothes onstage, my heart jumps a beat. Each time
Jobs showed the world his next creation, a wide grin
appeared across his face like a proud father holding his

newborn son.
What I truly admire about Steve Jobs is his persever-
ance. In 1985, he was kicked out of his own company,
one that he built just 10 years earlier in his parent's
garage. Instead of throwing in the towel and calling
it quits, he immediately went on to start another com-
puter company, "NeXT," and bought Pixar Animation
Studios, which would later go on to make some amazing
movies which I think we all know and love. Skip ahead
a decade - Apple stock is worth a mere $6 a share when
Apple buys NeXT, bringing Jobs back "home." Today,
Apple stock goes for roughly $380 a share.
His perseverance was more than just green arrows
on the NASDAQ. It was showing the world that if you
have a passion and a vision, and you really believe in
yourself, absolutely no one can stop you from "making
a dent in the universe," as Jobs once said. As a senior, I
take that to heart. As each day brings me one step clos-
er to graduation, I aim to leave my mark at this great
University, my own "universe," in whatever wayI can.
Thank you Steve Jobs, for instillingthat "live each day
as if it is your last" mentality in me.
There are so many great quotes from Jobs that I
could have included here, but they are too numerous to
fit on one page. If you haven't yet, do yourself a favor
and watch his 2005 commencement speech at Stanford
University.I promise you won't be disappointed.
I will leave you with the Jobs quote that always
seems to stick with me: "Stay hungry. Stay foolish."
Jake Steinerman is an LSA senior.

AAPS expelling
students of
different races
at unequal rates

Report finds
African-American
students suspended
more than others
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Parents of students in the
Ann Arbor Public School sys-
tem received a letter last week
detailing statis-
tics of student
behavior and $ A
disability ratios J
based on race
and ethnicity. s
The Sept. 27
letter written by
Elaine Brown, assistant super-
intendent for student interven-
tion and support services at Ann
Arbor Public Schools, included
data from the 2009-2010 school
year which revealed the school
system suspended and expelled
more African-American stu-
dents compared to students of
other races and ethnicities.
According to the letter, the
district is expanding the Posi-
tive Behavior Intervention Sup-
port model - a program that
aims to establish an academic
environment that increases
scholastic growth - in more
schools to try to decrease the
ratio of disciplinary actions
taken against students.
"(The school system) is pro-
moting and teaching and imple-
menting what good behavior
should look like, so we can
address some of the concerns
we have about suspension
and expulsion," Brown said.
"Therefore, if you (are) proac-
tive about it, then you eliminate
some of those poor behaviors."
As part of the Individuals
with Disability Education Act,
the state must collect data to
determine if there is an unequal
amount of students in a racial or
ethnic group with disabilities,
I the letter states. The data is bro-
ken down into four categories:
"identification of children with
disabilities," "identification of
children with disabilities in a
particular impairment catego-
ry," "placement of children in
particular education settings"
and "incidence, duration, and
type of disciplinary actions,
including suspensions and
expulsions," the letter states.

The state is required to
inform parents if there is a sig-
nificant disproportionate of any
race or ethnic group in the four
areas.
Data from the 2010-2011
school year also revealed that
the school system exceeded the
maximum ratio of 3.0 for a race
or ethnic group that is consid-
ered "cognitive impaired." The
ratio of African-American stu-
dents with cognitive impair-
ments for the 2010-2011 school
year was 3.11 - a decrease from
4.37 during the during the
2009-2010 year, according to
Brown.
Brown said this high ratio is
"nothing new," and the school is
working to decrease the ratio to
meet the IDEA guidelines.
"This year we're still working
on reviewing and revising our
processes and procedures and
trying to improve and get off the
so-called list," Brown said.
According to Brown, if the
district exceeds the accept-
able ratio, it must spend 15 per-
cent of the total grant money it
receives from IDEA to improve
the numbers. Brown said 15
percent of the grant money
totals to $400,000 for the 2010-
2011 school year.
To decrease the ratio of Afri-
can-American students with
cognitive impaired disabilities,
Brown said the school system is
reevaluating its cognitive test-
ing procedures.
"We're constantly monitor-
ing our (Individual Education
Programs) so that we're using
the most appropriate assess-
ment and that we're not using
any biased assessments so that
we can make sure and ensure
that we are doing the most
appropriate things for all stu-
dents," she said.
Andrea Horvath, the mother
of a sophomore at Commu-
nity High School and a kinder-
gartener at Ann Arbor Open
School, said she was confused
upon initially readingthe letter.
"When I read it, I had to
read it two times to understand
exactly what it meant," she said.
Horvath also expressed con-
cern about the issues addressed
in the letter.
"If that's what the statis-
tics are, then it's probably a big
problem," Horvath said.

to be the graduation speaker and
to get an honorary degree."
Abramson will be the first
woman to speak at a University
commencement ceremony since
then-CNN Chief International
Correspondent Christiane Aman-
pour spoke at Spring Commence-
ment in 2006. Coleman said the
University made a "special push"
to choose a woman to speak this
year.
"I sent my note out to the fac-
ulty and the community to nomi-
nate people to think about women
as they were nominating, and we
got some fabulous candidates
" Coleman said. "And having
Jill Abramson get this fabulous
position, I just thought was such
a happy and wonderful coinci-
dence."
The University's Board of
Regents is expected to approve
Abramson as the speaker and an
honorary degree recipient at its
monthly meeting on Thursday.
Abramson became executive
editor of The New York Times
on Sept. 6 - succeeding former
executive editor Bill Keller -.
and is the first woman to lead
the newspaper in its 160 years
of existence. She has worked at
the Times since 1997 and previ-
ously served as the newspaper's
managing editor and Washington
bureau chief.
"It's a huge honor to have this
job, and I've been focused in these
beginning weeks on appointing
my team of other editors to lead
the news report and that's been
exciting," Abramson said.
Rick Berke, the national page
editor of The New York Times
and a former Daily managing
editor in the late 1970s, said in

an interview with the Daily that
Abramson has had one of the most
successful careers compared to
other reporters and editors at the
Times. He added that Abramson
is the best person to deliver a
speech to students who will soon
step out of academia and into the
professional world.
"I think the timing is perfect,"
he said. "She's the brand new edi-
tor of what I selfishly think is the
finest journalistic institution in
the world ... I think she can be
an inspiration to a lot of young
people about getting to the top of
their career."
Charles Eisendrath, director of
the Knight-Wallace Fellowship,
played a large role in influenc-
ing Coleman's decision to choose
Abramson for the commence-
ment speaker.
Eisendrath pointed to the simi-
larity of Abramson being the first
woman executive editor of the
Times and University President
Mary Sue Coleman's being the
first woman to lead the Univer-
sity. When the Times announced
Abramson's promotion on June
2, Eisendrath called Abramson's
secretary that day to beat other
schools that would likely ask her
to give a keynote address.
"I knew if we didn't grab her,
Harvard would ... I wanted her
for Michigan," Eisendrath said.
An Honorary Degree Commit-
tee typically reviews potential
speakers and submits nomina-
tions to the University president,
but there was no time to get the
committee's approval, so Eisen-
drath went straight to Coleman.
"I called Mary Sue and said,
'What do you think? There's no
time for a committee delibera-
tion. You either have to say OK or
not OK."' Eisendrath said. "She
called back the next day and said,
'You bet."'

Eisendrath, a close friend of
Abramson, met her about six
years ago when she was a judge
for the Livingston Awards for
Young Journalists, an organi-
zation founded by Eisendrath
that grants awards to journalists
under age 35. When Abramson
heard about the Knight-Wallace
Fellows and their travels to plac-
es such as Russia, Turkey and
South America she wanted to get
involved, Eisendrath said.
"It was half a joke about trav-
el, but word at the time was that
the only place she gets to travel
are Washington, New York and
maybe L.A.," Eisendrath said.
Since getting involved with the
program, Abramson has traveled
with the fellows to Argentina
and Brazil. Last December, she
led a seminar in Sao Paulo, Brazil
about the WikiLeaks scandal and
the Times's decision-making pro-
cess about choosing what to print.
Amber Hunt, a 2010 Knight
Wallace Fellow and current Asso-
ciated Press editor for North
Dakota and South Dakota, met
Abramson on the trip to Brazil.
"She came across as such a true
fan of the Times and an honest-
to-goodness, gritty-as-hell New
Yorker to the core," Hunt said.
"It's clear she takes a lot of pride
not just in journalism, but in her
specific job. They have a strong
woman at the helm."
Hunt added: "It was quite a
surprise to watch the Times's
future No. 1 samba like a pro in
Sao Paulo."
In addition to traveling with
the fellows, Abramson has visited
the reporters in Ann Arbor and
invited them to The New York
Times office in New York City.
She's also helped shape the fel-
lowship by creating ways for the
journalists to learn multimedia
and online production skills.

"She's passionately interested
in helping young journalists,"
Eisendrath said.
In the past, the University has
invited successful journalists to
give a commencement address,
including ABC News anchor Rob-
ert Woodruff in 2008 and Auto-
mobile Magazine founder David
Davis Jr. in 2004. Other journal-
ists have received University hon-
orary degrees like Washington
Post columnist Eugene Robinson,
who gave the graduate exercises
address last spring.
Berke said journalists have an
interesting perspective about the
world and society because they're
"observers to history."
"Our jobs are to try to give
people a sense of what's going
on in the world from a closed in,
yet detached perspective, and I
think that kind of background
experience can be very valuable
when it comes time to talking to
graduates about life and the coun-
try and what might be ahead for
them," Berke said.
Jeremy Peters, a media report-
er for The New York Times and
a former Daily news editor,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
Abramson's speech will likely
resonate with students who are
about to "enter a world that is so
unpredictable."
"She has had a front row seat as
our society has undergone seis-
mic change over the last decade,
and she has seen it all through
the prism of a business that has
evolved more dramatically than
most," Peters wrote.
In the event of breaking news,
a natural disaster or other world
catastrophe, Abramson said she
is confident she'll still make it to
Crisler Arena to give her speech.
"I don't foresee that a news
event would prevent me from
coming," she said.

Big House Big Heart aims to raise $1M

15,000 runners
raise money for
cancer research
By AARON GUGENHEIM
For the Daily
While sweating, smiling and
listening to the pump of reggae, a
silent stampede of runners raced
down South University Avenue
yesterday on their way to the Big
House.
The runners participated in
Big House Big Heart, a series of
races devoted to raising money
for local charities and the Univer-
sity of Michigan Health System.
Proceeds from the event, which
featured a 5K, 10K and two one-
mile races, support three UMHS
programs: the Program for Neu-
rology Research & Discovery, C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital and Von
Voigtlander Women's Hospital
and the Cardiovascular Center.
Big House Big Heart started in
2007 with more than 5,000 par-
ticipants and a $150,000 contribu-
tion to charities. Since then, it has
grown in runners and donations
each year.
This year, the event had approx-
imately 15,000 participants and
775 volunteers, of whom 200 are
student-athletes at the University.
Colleen Greene, the logistics
chair for Champions for Charity -
the organization hosting the event
- expressed enthusiasm about the
growth of the event. The organi-
zation now raises money for 147
non-profits while also supporting
UMHS, Greene said. She added

that this year the organization
hopes to top $1 million.
Significantly, the race was
extended across the globe, with
500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan
participating in the 5k and 10k
races via a virtual feed.
Sgt. Christopher Wright, a vol-
unteer for last year's race, helped
organize the run this year in
Afghanistan.
At the race in Ann Arbor, run-
ners finished on the 50-yard line
in the Big House. Brandon Bethke
was firstto finish in the 10Kwith a
time of 30:38.
Bethke is a post-collegiate run-
ner based in Ann Arbor hoping to
make the Olympics in 2012. He
qualified for the 5K the Olympic
trials with a time of 13:25 at the
Payton Jordan Invitational inPalo
Alto, Calif.
Bethke said he ran inthe race to
check his training progress, since
he's preparing for the Pan-Amer-
ican Games, with the next Games
scheduled to take place in Toronto
in 2015. He added that he was
excited to participate in the event.
"Running for a cause is what it
is all about," Bethke saidbefore he
shuffled off to take pictures with
eager fans.
LSA junior Thomas Yeh, anoth-
er participant, was supporting a
charity called My Team Triumph.
Theorganization,whichhaschap-
tern in eight states, pairs people in
wheel chairs with runners to push
them through the race.
"It is about being able to reach
out and help out," Yeh said.
Yeh added that the races pro-
vide a forum for disabled people to
experience something they other-

wise couldn't.
This year, 45 runners from
MRun, a University running club,
helped push three wheel chair
users in the race. MRun also vol-
unteered with My Team Triumph
for the Dexter-Ann Arbor Half
Marathon and helped raise money
for the charity with a bake sale
and a team raffle.
For Karleigh Kroll, a student in
the School of Education, the race
was an opportunity to run with
friends.
"I have been wanting to run a
10K, and a bunch of my friends

were running it and I thought
it'd be fun," she said.
Though Kroll has been casu-
ally running for two years, this
was her first race and she didn't
train much for it.
"I pretty much just got up and
ran," she said.
Despite it being her first race,
Kroll said she really enjoyed it
and finished with a time of about
one hour.
"It was a lot of fun. If this is
what all lOK's are like, I'll run
them over and over again," she
said.

NATURE TALKS
TEDx flourishes in the Arb
Nichols Arboretum hosts gathering of people
and ideas in zero-waste environment
By Jeff Waraniak I Daily Arts Writer

'Thrones' wins,
others die

Attending a TEDx event is like
taking a much-needed deep breath:
enriching, rejuvenating and some-
thing you might only have the
opportunity to do every once in a
while.
Yesterday afternoon, over 200
students, University staff mem-
bers and environmental enthu-
siasts took the opportunity to
gather in the Nichols Arboretum
Amphitheater to hear a series of
talks focusing on environmental
sustainability and its applications
in all areas of life - ranging from
education, to art, to the deep-
breathing practices of yoga.
TED is a nonprofit organization
that began in1984 with the mission
to connect people acrossthe realms
of technology, education and
design (hence the acronym). Since
then, TED has evolved into a global
platform for innovative thinkers to
share their ideas through online

videos, annual conferences and
independently organized events
under the title of TEDx.
"TEDxNicholsArboretum"
marked the third TEDx event held
at the University in the past two
years. Unlike the previous confer-
ences, no formal advertising pre-
ceded yesterday's event in an effort
to generate zero waste.
D.J. Ferguson, an English teach-
er at Chelsea High School, kicked
off the sustainability talks by ask-
ing audience members to remem-
ber something important they
learned in high school. As audi-
ence members racked their brains
for an answer, Ferguson demon-
strated that the most valuable les-
sons probably didn't come from a
textbook.
"Human beings learn through
experiences," Ferguson said in
his talk. "We're not designed to
sit down. Sitting down is the most

unnatural position you can be in as
a human being."
Ferguson explained his belief
that the purpose of education
should be to create sustainable
human beings, not to plow through
lesson plans or bolster standard-
ized test scores.
"We are literally educating our-

selves away from everythingthatis
essentially human," Ferguson said.
The second speaker, profes-
sor of physics and yogi Jasprit
Singh, connected the sustainable
mentality to the practice of yoga.
Explaining that yoga calls for its
practitioners to "build themselves

'HIMYM' continues legendary run
By Kelly Etz I Daily Arts Writer

We need to talk about
"Game of Thrones."
You know, the HBO
show about the feuding king-
doms in a fantastical realm,
nomi-
nated for
13 Emmys
in its first
season
(including
Outstand-
ing Drama
Series) and
winning for KAVI
Support- SHEKHAR
ing Actor PANDEY
in a Drama
Series
(Peter Dinklage, like a boss).
Indeed, I already slathered
the show with praise midway
through its run, but its excel-
lence increased exponentially
as the season wound down -
the final few episodes would
have probably earned The
Michigan Daily's first six-
star reviews. By the season
finale, "Game of Thrones" had
already catapulted from the
"best shows on television" to
the best shows of All Time
discussion, partly because
of a devilishly magnificent
sequence that changed dra-
matic television forever.
Beware all ye who ven-
ture further in this article:
HUMONGOUS SPOILERS for
"Game of Thrones" lie ahead.
Throughout the season, the
show has captured numerous
storylines in tandem, each
with its own protagonist -
from the roguish dwarf Tyrion
Lannister (Dinklage) to the
solemn, honor-bound Jon
Snow (Kit Harington) to the
fierce, oft-disrobed Daenerys
Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) -
but the lead leading man was
unquestionably Ned Stark
(Sean Bean), the reluctant,
think-first stab-later ruler.
Ned's dilemmas have been
not only the centerpiece of
show, but also the marketing
campaign, as Bean was the
most recognizable actor ina
cast almost entirely composed
of unknowns (sorry, chubby

There are few shows that can to
carry a storyline as well as "How
I Met Your Mother." For six sea-
sons now, the
CBS show has.*** a

away just yet, CBS
as it even makes
clear we're nowhere near the end
of the story. While this kind of
drawn-out storyline could become
tiresome for other sitcoms, "Moth-
er" pulls it off perfectly.
Season seven kicks off by tying
up all the loose threads left over
from last season's finale. There's
Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) as a
groom, but no hint as to whom his
bride will be just yet. Four episodes

in, it looks to be a toss up between
Robin (Cobie Smulders) and Nora
(Nazanin Boniadi, "Iron Man").
Knowing the way the series usu-
ally goes, the answer won't be
revealed for quite a while.
The new episodes also tie in
Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lily's
(Alyson Hannigan) news about
their baby on the way. The series
has already set up some sure-to-be
entertaining plotlines surrounding

ney to wear a tie covered with rub-

long arcs are no stranger to "Moth-

ery room sans Marshall. er" without the love drama. The
Another season-long joke is also new season has Robin mooning

over Barney, while he's smitten
- or so it appears - with Nora.
There's also Ted's realization he's
not going to give up on love just yet,
which again leaves him toeing the
line between endearing and whiny.
And Victoria (Ashley Williams,
"Something Borrowed") returns,
announcingthat maybe Ted isn't as

guy from "A Knight's Tale").
Plus, Bean has the epic-geek
cred for playing fan-favorite
Boromir in "Lord of the Rings."
After setting him up as the
Glorious Hero of "Game of
Thrones," in one of the most
startling moments in the his-
tory of the medium, the ninth
episode of the series concluded
with the merciless execution
of Ned Stark in front of hun-
dreds of spectators ... including
his daughters. Beloved father
and husband, steadfast soldier
and the only decent man in
all of Westeros - Ned's dead,
baby. Ned's dead.
True, this twist was first
unleashed in George R.R.
Martin's novel from which
the series is adapted, but to be
able to effectively pull it off
in an immensely expensive
television series is astonish-
ing. TV shows kill off major
characters constantly, even the
main characters - but never in
the penultimate episode of the
first season. Imagine if Jack
Shephard died after falling
ins aheroin-smuggling plane
instead of Boone on "Lot"
Or if Tony was popped by the
thugs sent by Uncle Junior at
the end of the first season of
"The Sopranos."
SPOILERS
are coming.
No viewer would have even
imagined that either of those
characters could have died,
because television conventions
dictate thatrdoes notrhappen -
that's why "Game of Thrones"
changed the game. Itcraised the
stakes to a level once thought
impossible, where any charac-
ter from the presumed lead to
the stray extra is expendable.
Ever since The Incident (the
clever term I coined for Ned's
execution), it's been impossible
to watch other shows with the
same level of investment and
enthusiasm. Take last season
of "True Blood": At the end
of the eighth episode, Sookie
gets shot in the gut and starts
to bleed out. Pre-"Thrones,"
the cliffhanger would have
barely registered, knowing
her life was never actually in
danger - o and behold, Sookie
made a full recovery within
the first five minutes of the
next episode (vampire blood
works wonders). But in this
post-"Thrones" world, it felt
cheap, almost pathetic in its
predictability.
This issue is exacerbated
in network television, which
takes even fewer risks and has
even lower stakes. As much as
I like "Terra Nova," its formu-
laic necessity makes sure there
is no tension thatthe Shannon
family will ever be ripped to
bits by a T-Rex at any moment.
The only network show to
come close to the incredible
stakes of "Game of Thrones"
was "24," where any given
supportingcharacter could be
killed off in any given episode,
no matter how beloved they
were (miss you, Edgar Stiles).
But the key phrase is support-

ingactor - at the end of the
day, Jack Bauer was always
goingto be fine.
"Game of Thrones," in its
impeccable greatness, has
ruined all other dramatic tele-
vision for me. Until the rest of
the industry catches up to this
new bar of television storytell-
ing, I'll just have to bide my
time with the passing flings
of fall premieres and pilots.
(There's always a chance one
of the stewardesses on "Pan
Am" will get murdered. Oh
wait, no there isn't) Of course,
that's only until "Game of
Thrones" returns in the spring
- in the meantime, I'll be
chanting "April is coming" as
my new mantra.

cooking contest
By SARAH SQUIRE
Web Development Manager
Saturday's cook-off was
advertised as a competition, but
the six carts and throngs of visi-
tors were all winners.
The six food carts of Mark's
Carts on West Washington
Street went head-to-head in a
cook-off sponsored by French
cookware manufacturer Le
Creuset on Saturday. Custom-
ers tasted free samples of each
cart's entry and submitted bal-
lots marking their favorites.
To first-time diners, the cook-
off looked like a special event.
But for returning visitors, the
mix of students, families and
other Ann Arbor locals enjoying
the live music was just another
afternoon at Mark's Carts.
"It's a favorite place of city
staff for lunch during the day,"
said Ann Arbor resident Jamie
Kidwell, who saw a sign adver-

came for dinner the night before.
"They did class it up a little bit, I
think (the food is) still all good
on any day."
Sarah Suhadolnik, a third-
year graduate student at the Uni-
versity, came to Mark's Carts for
the first time Saturday after she
heard about the carts and cook-
off through a friend of a friend.
"It was great," Suhadolnik
said. "Surprisingly, I liked the
kimchi stuffing best, which is
definitely outside of my normal
food repertoire."
After the day's taste, Suhabol-
nik said she'll probably come
back to Mark's Carts to eat.
Each cart was given a differ-
ently colored Le Creuset pot to
create a dish in the same style
as its regular menu. Most of the
owners modified one of their
popular dishes for both new and
returning customers.
"Let's give each of the carts
a pot, the same pot, so they are
on a level playing field and see
what they can do with it," said

Michigan.
Ranallo said the goal of the
event was to generate business
for Mark's Carts and Downtown
Home and Garden. The competi-
tion was second to the publicity.
"We figure today they're all
winners because of the crowd
and the exposure, but we will
crown a winner," she said.
At 1 p.m., Ranallo collected
the 221 ballots and disappeared
to calculate the winner. By 1:30
p.m. the crowd had thinned, and
most people who had castballots
earlier had moved on with their
weekend plans.
The people still sitting in the
courtyard turned toward Hut-K
Chaats after hearing a scream
of delight. Ranallo had snuck
behind the cart, which serves
a healthy version of traditional
Indian street food, to tell Sumi
Bhojani the cart's shanu chaat
won the cook-off.
Sumi's husband Swaroop Bho-
jani, owner of the Hut-K Chaats
cart and Hut-K Chaats restau-
rant on Packard Road, was less
shocked than his wife at the
announcement.
"Frankly, I wasn't surprised
because this is the most popular
dish at the restaurant," he said.
Though shanu chaat, a sweet
and spicy dish consisting mainly
of chickpeas, is a regular on the
restaurant's menu, this was the
first time it was served at the
cart.
"We loved (the event). Good

Mark Hodesh, owner of

smiles on Saturday.
"Perfect weather, good pub-
licity and (the cook-off) was a big
hit," he said.
In addition to the cook-off,
Hodesh cooked five gallons
of chili and chef Matt Banks
smoked two briskets for anyone
visiting the store to taste.
Downtown Home and Gar-
den's third-annual pickling con-
test, which offered 54 pickles,
medleys, chutneys and salsas
for patrons who wished to par-
ticipate in judging, took over the

the store.
Phillis Engelbert, co-owner
of another cart in Mark's Carts
called The Lunch Room, said she
sold out most of the dishes on the
menu in addition to giving away
all the samples for the cook-off.
Hodesh and Ranallo are open
to holding more cook-offs in the
future. They were already dis-
cussing possibilities for future
events and special offerings

after the winner of Saturday's
cook-off was announced.
"It was just a good vibe out

over Robin as he'd like to believe.
Here's where the series can
sometimes string a storyline out
too long. Ted and Robin again?
That's been over for four seasons
now and we've heard her referred
to as "Aunt Robin" almost since
the beginning. We're over the two
of them. As for Robin and Bar-
ney, who knows? But the pairing
feels odd, as the two don't seem to
share the needed chemistry.

Putting the who's-in-love-
with-whom drama aside, the
show's other flaw is that it fre-
quently walks the line between
clever and overdone. The audience
doesn't need the jokes spelled out
for them on the voice-over. The
needless sum-up after every com-
mercial break is tiresome, and
Bob Saget's ("Full House") con-
stant freeze-frame interruptions
disrupt the flow.
Despite these relatively small
flaws, the series often has perfect
comic timing, shown to remark-
able effect in the new season

when Ted is narrating his encoun-
ter with Victoria, while Lily, Mar-
shall and Barneyare negotiating a
bet on which the stakes are Bar-
ney getting a look at Lily's preg-
nancy boobs. It's the perfect mix
of humor and reflection.
Undoubtedly, the series is one
of the best long-running com-
edies on TV. And even though
we really (really!) want to know
who Ted ends up with already,
it's not about the destination, it's
about the journey. And the jour-
ney is definitely what "Mother"
does best.

Backstabbing
thriller reaches the
core of politics
By EMILY BOUDREAU
DailyArts Writer
In the opening scene of "The
Ides of March," Stephen Mey-
ers (Ryan Gosling, "Drive") is
trying to get a
pair of podi-
ums raised two
extra inches in TheIdes
preparation for
a debate. Why? Of Marh
To make the AtQuality16,
other guy look Rave and State
shorter. And
making the Columbia
other guy look
shorter, making the other guy
look bad, is an essential part of
"The Ides of March."
"The Ides of March" is a politi-
cal thriller (loosely based on the
play "Farragut North") centered
around the Democratic Primary
Elections in Ohio - though many
might recognize a few restau-
rants in Detroit, as well as some
Ann Arbor scenery, extras in the
background. Meyers is a wide-
eyed campaign manager and
consultant working for Governor
Mike Morris (George Clooney,

"The American") and is one of the
best political minds in the busi-
ness. Just as it seems his team
has everything figured out and
the election in the bag, scandal
erupts through an interplay of
sex, media and political figures,
and "The Ides of March" becomes
a meditation on integrity.
The cast is flawless. Phillip
Seymour Hoffman ("Moneyball")
plays Paul Zara, the intelligent
but old-fashioned chief campaign
manager for Morris. Through
no fault of his own, his role gets
a little bit buried under all the
dirt. Clooney - also the film's
director - doesn't have much
screen time, but his articulate,
moderate stances on issues and
his charisma draw the audience
to him whether we see his face or
not. Morris is so earnest and so
likeable when he speaks that it's
shocking when he turns out not
to be as wholesome as he looks.
Clooney successfully capturesthe
disconnect between the private
and public face of a candidate.
Gosling is the actor who will
most likely walk away with the
Oscar nomination for best actor
after his performance as Meyers.
He works behind the scenes and
crafts Morris. He decides who
gets elected and maybe one of the
most powerful men in America.
Meyers does not have Morris's

open-faced charm, but he is not
a traditional politician. Gosling
rises to the challenge of portray-
ing the tragic arc of a man with
ideals in a dirty world. As a result,
his story and his character grip
the audience with the most force.
Like Clooney's other political
movie, 2005's "Good Night and
Good Luck," "The Ides of March"
moves slowly and it's important
to keep track of details. How-
ever, the plot's momentum does
build energy. By the end of the
film, whole scenes can be carried
out by a smoldering exchange of
glances between characters -
which might sound boring, but
when paired with the film's omi-
nous soundtrack and dark setting
makes foranail-bitingexperience.
The political tragedy has been
done before - like in 2006's "All
the King's Men." But "The Ides
of March" looks at the people
who make politicians rather than
the politicians themselves. More
importantly, the film does so in a
post-Clinton, post-Spitzer, post-
Weiner world where scandals
are so easily revealed. While the
rules andthetechnologyinvolved
in the political game might have
changed, the story has not, and
though "The Ides of March"
exposes some flaws in the politi-
cal system, it doesn't suggest that
they can be changed.

Last semester, three girls jour-
neyed to Havana obsessed with
culture and came back to the
states with the culture-centric
Cuban hip-hop group Obsesion.
Obsesion, fronted by Magia
L6pez and Alexey Rodriguez,
has been rapping and play-
ing music in Cuba since 1996.
The group's music resonates
throughout the country, as they
sing in Spanish to fans around
the world about Cuban political
problems, religion, customs and
culture.
When LSA seniors Amara
Lopez, Anna Megdell and Nicole
Mueller traveled to Cuba with
the University's anthropology
department, their GSI Vanessa
Diaz - the group's friend and
translator - introduced them
to Obsesion. The three girls
felt such a connection that they
decided to bring the group to
Ann Arbor for Cuba Week, a
celebration of Cuban hip hop
through music, film and lec-
tures, which took place Oct. 3 - 7.
"We wanted to find a way to
continue our experience person-
ally," Megdell said. "It was really
hard to come home. We wanted
to share our experience with
Ann Arbor because we feel so
rounded in both communities."
With a little self-motivation
and outside help, the girls wel-
comed Obsesion to the Univer-
sity for a week.
On Tuesday, Obsesion attend-
ed Professor Ruth Behar and
Professor David Frey's anthro-
pology classes to speak about
Cuban life and developments,
as well as their lyrics and travel
process. On Wednesday, in an

coherently," Prof. Singh outlined
seven ways in which the practice
promotes "good life" in much
the same way as sustainability.
The seven concepts that Singh
listed included physical well-
ness, creativity, balance, loving
and receiving love, freedom of
expression, meditation and the
ability to see oneself in others.
Shortly after his talk, Prof.
Singh led the audience in a brief
yoga session. Every audience
member could be seen reaching
his or her arms to the sky and
heaving in chestfulls of warm
arboretum air.
While the first half ofthe event
focused on the individual's role in
sustainability, the second set of
talks examined sustainability on
a community level.
Jennifer Canvasser, an Envi-
ronmental Health Organizer at
the Ecology Center in Ann Arbor,
opened the second session by
explaining how toxicology often
gets overlooked when thinking
about sustainability since harm-
ful chemicals are difficult to
trace.
"We don't always know what
we're being exposed to," Can-
vasser said. "Toxic chemicals
are out of sight and out of mind
because we just don't see them or
talk about them."
Designer and Program in the
Environment instructor Kat
Superfisky gave one of the final
talks of the day, describing how
sustainability isn't just about effi-
ciency, but beauty too.
"Sustainability can and should
be sexy," Superfisky said. "If we
have a beautiful world, we're
going to want to live in that
world."
At the close of the event, Busi-
ness senior Poonam Dagli, one of
the event's principal organizers,
said she was incredibly pleased
with the audience and the feel-
ings stirredby the talks.
"Sometimes sustainabil-
ity is something that can get you
down," she said. "But right now,
I feel really uplifted, like I can go
out and do anything."
That and a deep breath are
exactly what TEDx is all about.

Michigan hounds Wildcats, overcomes halftime deficit

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
EVANSTON - It's fitting
that football is played in four
quarters, because the Michigan
football team's defense had an
identity for each in Saturday's
game against Northwestern.
The defensive unit didn't dis-
play its dominant form until the
third quarter of the 12th-ranked
Wolverines' 42-24 win at Ryan
Field.
During the first quarter, the

Michigan defense was porous,
being gashed by the option and
giving up 14 points.
In the second quarter the
defense was inconsistent, mak-
ing a huge stop on 4th-and-1 but
also givingup 132 yards passing.
Behind the porous and incon-
sistent defense, the Wolverines
(2-0 Big Ten, 6-0 overall) went
into halftime down 10 points,
24-14.
As the Wolverines mounted
the comeback, the fourth quar-
ter was when the corps provided

the killer instinct - finishing
the second-half shutout.
But the tone was set in the
third.
Early in the third quarter,
when Michigan pulled within
three at 24-21, Wildcat quarter-
back Dan Persa was stopped for
no gain. A sack followed on the
next play. And on 3rd-and-16,
senior defensive lineman Ryan
Van Bergen broke free, crush-
ing Persa and forcing an early,
incomplete throw.
Persa stayed in the grass a

split second longer. Van Bergen
got up and strutted off the field.
This was the defense that they
were supposed to be playing -
the third-quarter defense.
"We knew as a front four, it
would come down to us," Mar-
tin said. "We knew we had to get
to the quarterback."
The Wolverines ended the
day with four sacks, three in the
second half.
The third quarter also pro-
duced the calling card for the
Michigan defense - turnovers.

While the Wolverines lost the
turnover battle, 3-2, the turn-
overs they did force had a bigger
impact. Michigan junior quar-
terback Denard Robinson threw
three interceptions, setting up
10 'of Northwestern's 24 total
points.
It would have been 14 had
Wildcat receiver Christian
Jones not dropped a pass in the
endzone with seven seconds left
in the first half.
But the Northwestern inter-
ceptions were all in the first

half.
Junior linebacker Brandin
Hawthorne's diving intercep-
tion late in the third quarter
sparked a drive that put Michi-
gan up 35-24. Sophomore safe-
ty Thomas Gordon's strip and
fumble recovery came on North-
western's next drive, with the
Wildcats in Michigan territory.
"We're very confident in our
abilities to get turnovers," Mar-
tin said. "If you get a lot of guys
to the ball, good things are going

Roundtree, Hemingway and receiving corps step upin dutch

Daily Sports Editor
EVANSTON - Entering
Saturday night's game against
Northwestern, Michigan red-
shirt junior wide receiver Roy
Roundtree had as many recep-
tions this season as he did games
started - five.
After one half against the
Wildcats (0-2 Big Ten, 2-3 over-
all), Roundtree was nonexis-
tent on the stat sheet yet again.
The Wolverines trailed 24-14
and were in desperate need of
a spark heading into the second
half.
Roundtree, Michigan's recep-
tions leader last season, was
the catalyst of an eight-play,
80-yard drive out of the break
that helped spark the Wolver-
ines' 42-24 victory.
On the opening drive of the
second half, No. 11 Michigan
(2-0, 6-0) was faced with a 3rd-

and-11 from its own 19-yard
line. Junior quarterback Denard
Robinson dropped back in the
pocket, looking for a receiver.
He found Roundtree cut-
ting left down the middle for a
17-yard gain to keep the drive
alive and keep the dynamic
Wildcat offense off the field.
Just two plays later, Robinson
found Roundtree again - this
time for a 57-yard bomb. On play
action, Robinson rolled right
and noticed Roundtree streak-
ing down the field in single
coverage. Robinson lofted the
ball up, and Roundtree beat the
Wildcat defender on the jump
ball at the Northwestern three-
yard line.
"We were working all sum-
mer on stuff like that," Robinson
said. "That's what he does. Our
wide receivers can get big like
that."

Freshman Di Giuseppe scores twice in 'M' weekend sweep of Bentley

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Sunday marked freshman
Phil Di Giuseppe's first birthday
as a Wolverine.
And he kicked off the celebra-
tions a day early with a pair of
goals in the BENTLEY 1
series fina- MICHIGAN 5
le of the
the Michi~ BENTLEY 1
gan hockey MICHIGAN 4
team's
weekend sweep of Bentley Uni-
versity.
Di Giuseppe's goals on Satur-
day night were just two of the
nine that No. 6 Michigan (3-0)
scored over the course of two
days. And though there were

moments during both games
when Bentley seemed to give
the Wolverines a little more
than they bargained for, the 5-1
and 4-1 outcomes silenced the
Falcons.
"It was a good weekend over-
all," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "Bentley played real-
ly well, they played hard and
they gave us everything that we
could handle."
But Di Giuseppe had no dif-
ficulty taming the Falcons on
Saturday.
He tipped a loose puck in the
net for his first career goal a
little more than 10 minutes into
the first period to give Michigan
its first lead of the night. And
after Bentley responded with a

goal of its own midway through
the second stanza, Di Giuseppe
received a feed in the crease
from sophomore forward Luke
Moffatt on a power play to beat
the goaltender and give Michi-
gan a lead it wouldn't relinquish.
The puck found itself in the
back of the Bentley net two more
times after that - junior for-
ward A.J. Treais capitalized on
another Michigan power play in
the third period and freshman
forward Alex Guptill added an
empty-netter.
It was Di Giuseppe, though,
who set Michigan's tone for
the night. A Bentley goal that
appeared to put the Falcons in
the lead in the second period
was waved off due to goalten-

der interference. That was the
wake-up call the Wolverines
needed in order to get their act
together, and that was when Di
Giuseppe answered with his
second goal.
Di Giuseppe claims it was all
a matter of being in the right
place at the right time and gives
full credit to his linemates.
Whether it was opportunistic
or not, Berenson recognized the
improvement in DiGiuseppe's
play over the course of the
weekend.
"I think (Di Giuseppe) played
simpler and not as cute," Beren-
son said. "We're after him to
use his speed, and then (we) can
make our moves. If you're not

Late-game goals propel 'M' PORISMONDAY COLUMN

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
The puck lying in the net
behind Michigan fifth-year
senior goalie Shawn Hunwick
was a wake-up call.
Bentley looked like it had just
done the improbable on Satur-
day: a team ranked 10th out of
12 in the Atlantic Hockey Asso-
ciation preseason poll apparently
took a one-goal lead late in the
second period against the No. 6
Michigan hockeyteam.
Ultimately, a wake-up call was
all that it was.
After a few brief seconds of
celebration, the referees waved
off the goal due to a goaltender
interference penalty on Bentley
forward Joe Campanelli.
The scare, though, was real.
The Falcons hung close with
the Wolverines for both games
of the weekend series, even
though the score was lopsided
in the two Michigan victories.
Bentley trailed by just one goal
entering the final frame in both
contests, but the constant Michi-
gan onslaught - the Wolverines
dominated shots 93-41 on the
weekend - eventually broke
down the Falcons in each game.
"We've been conditioning
pretty hard all spring and sum-
mer," said sophomore forward
Luke Moffatt. "I think right now
(it's) just the fatigue factor. We're
able to wear down the other team
and by the third period, they just
can't keep up with us."
Conditioning from three
games prior to the weekend
series also earned Michigan (3-0)
an upper-hand in the third peri-
od. Bentley (0-2) hadn't played
a single game before this week-
end's series.
Third-period performance
decided each contest. The Wol-
verines outscored Bentley a com-
bined 5-0 in the final frame, led
by junior forward A.J. Treais and
freshman forward Alex Guptill,
who each scoredtwo goals apiece
in the third period.
Still, it took the near-Bentley

goal to light a spark under the
Michigan offense.
Freshman forward Phil Di
Giuseppe tapped in the go-ahead
goal just 34 seconds after the
penalty thanks to a feed to the
crease by Moffatt.
"That was a pretty big momen-
tum switch," Moffatt said. "We
were able to get that power play
goal and boost up the whole
bench, and it gave us a lot of
momentum after that."
Conditioning hasn't been the
sole contributor to the boost
in third-period play. Michigan
coach Red Berenson replaced
Guptill on the first line with
freshman forward Travis Lynch
for the third period on Friday.
Senior forward David Wohlberg
had been playing center with
Guptill and senior forward Luke
Glendening on the wings, and
Berenson believed they could
generate more offense with
Wohlberg there too.
The move paid off. Glendening
scored the Wolverines' second
goal ofthethird period on Friday,
and Lynch and Wohlberg record-
ed assists. All three of Michigan's
third-period goals in that game
came in a three-minute span,
transforming a one-goal game
with five minutes remaining into

a blowout.
Scoring has been contagious
for Michigan this season: it
scoredthree goals in five minutes
against Niagara, and just 80 sec-
onds separated goals by Guptill
and Treais on Saturday, although
Guptill's was an empty-netter.
"College hockey is all about
momentum," Berenson said.
"That's the great thing about
Yost Ice Arena and playing at
Michigan. If we can get some-
thing going and the crowd gets
into it and the players just get'
into it, there just seems to be
another level. And it can intimi-
date an opponent and the game
changes."
The momentum on Saturday
came from Bentley's mistake
rather than anything that the
Wolverines did. Hunwick likely
would have made a routine save
if Campanelli hadn't impeded his
path to the puck, butthe momen-
tum swing proved decisive.
And Michigan capitalized

"That was big," Berenson said.
"We were lucky that it didn't

ED MoCH/Daily
Michigan fans congragated en masse Saturday at Ryan Field. The Wolverines felt right at home in Evanston,
Don't take the l ouse
experience for granted


EVANSTON -
Nathan Anderson trudged
up to Gate T at Ryan
Field three hours before
kickoff. He held a gallon of sweet
tea in one hand and a bag of chips
in the other.
Nathan,
a junior at
Northwest-
ern, lives for
game day. But '
he's stuck in a
city that hard-
ly has a foot- STEPHEN J.
ball culture to NESBITT
speak of.
Nathan
rarely sees a sellout at Ryan
Field. The smallest stadium
in the Big Ten seats a capacity
crowd of 47,130 - a mere 62,771
less than at Michigan Stadium. .
He knew Saturday would be dif-
ferent, but it wouldn't be pretty:
Michigan was coming to town.
So he arrived three hours
early to sit outside the student
entrance, which opens 90 min-
utes before kickoff, and sat out-
side Gate T for hours, wishing to
feel the typical college football
atmosphere.
The minds are brilliant, the
teams are good - but the two
don't mix. More students in
Evanston stroll around in busi-
ness suits on football Saturdays
than in Wildcat purple. Along
the front of the stadium, a ban-
ner proclaims, "Northwestern:
Chicago's Big Ten Team." This
season, Illinois countered with
a rival campaign to claim the
Fighting Illini as "Kings of Chi-
cago."
In proximity, Northwestern
is Chicago's team. But in reality,
due to the small student body,
Northwestern has the second-
fewest alumni living in the
Chicagoland area of any Big Ten
school.
In the early hours on Satur-
day morning, block 'M's lined
the shoreline of Lake Michigan.
Tailgates dotted every open
parking lot on campus - all of

them hoisting Michigan flags and
tents.
Northwestern students
receive football tickets as part
of their tuition package - atten-
dance is first come, first served.
No one was there to battle
Nathan, as he sipped his sweet
tea and waited for the gate to
swing open.
Once the cold lake wind and
snow begin swirling over Evan-
ston, Nathan said showing up an
hour before the game would still
guarantee a spot in the front 15
rows.
The Michigan game marked
the first home game of the scho-
lastic year with the students on
campus for the fall semester. The
situation for the team - and the
fans - was clear:
If we don't win thisgame,
nobody will come back to the next
one.
So they came. The stadium
filled to the brim. An attendance
of 47,330 was announced.
On the sidewalk bordering
Central Street, directly in front
of the stadium, a pair of Michi-
gan fans were searching for
tickets.
"I've got two for $180 each,"
one scalper said.
"I went to the Michigan-Notre
Dame game and got two for $150,
man," the fan said.
"Yeah, well this is a big game,
too."
Not for Michigan. But it was
giant for Northwestern coach Pat
Fitzgerald and Wildcat football.
The students and Northwest-
ern faithful faced an opposing
sideline nearly 70-percent filled
with Michigan fans. That was
hard. It was the Little Big House.
z But then they suffered the
same second-half heartbreak the
Wildcats' have conditioned them
to expect.
In the post-game press con-
ference, Fitzgerald knew what
everyone was thinking. He ended
his opening statement by plead-
ing with students to return, to
remember the first-half Wildcats.

"There was great fan support
tonight, especiallyour students,"
Fitzgerald said. "It was an abso-
lutely outstanding environment,
one not only that we thank them
for but one we expect of them as
we move forward.
"So we'll see them back here in
a couple weeks for homecoming."
But many won't be back.
Before the game, one student
remarked on the student sec-
tion's 2011 T-shirts.
"We should have a new motto
on them," she said. "How about,'
All we do is almost win?"'
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
doesn't have to coddle the stu-
dent section. Fitzgerald has
to coddle the entire fan base.
Michigan students don't have to
be told by a head coach what is
expected of them.
It's almost hard to fathom a
scenario where college students
would choose not to attend a full
slate of games they've already
paid for. But that's the Michigan
difference - or one of them.
At Michigan, the expectations
are from within, not beamed
down from Hoke or Athletic
Director Dave Brandon. It's why
Michigan, unlike Northwest-
ern, has home-field advantage.
It's why every home game since
November 8, 1975 has drawn a
crowd of more than 100,000.
"It was a good environment,
we just let our fans down," said
Northwestern quarterback Dan
Persa. "We've got to play a lot bet-
ter than that."
The difference is that when the
Wildcats let their fans down, they
don't come back. Denard Robin-
son can always expect 100,000
surrounding the field at Michigan
Stadium.
We're lucky at Michigan. We're
blessed.
Don't take the Big House
experience for granted. Nathan
wouldn't.

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
EVANSTON - As the saying
goes, third down's the charm.
Maybe not exactly those
words, but junior quarterback
Denard Rob-
inson and the NOTEBOOK
Michigan foot-
ball team certainly established it
as a new mantra against North-
western.
The offense was nearly
untouchable when eyeing the
first-down marker in No. 11
Michigan's 42-24 victory over
the Wildcats on Saturday, con-
verting on 14 of 17 third-down
opportunities.
"They just made plays," said
Northwestern defensive end
Tyler Scott. "We didn't exe-
cute here and there, which was
huge. That's one of our goals as
a defense, to get off the field on
third down, and we didn't exe-
cute."
The Wildcats couldn't get the
defense off the field, which kept
the dangerous Robinson in the
backfield and star Northwestern
quarterback Dan Persa stuck on
the sideline.
Michigan burned up time
and won the time-of-possession
battle in each quarter, finish-
ing with 37:57 to the Wildcats'
22:03.
"Yeah, that was a big deal,"
Robinson said. "We were hold-
ing the possession of the ball and
that's what we focus on every
game. We want to win that."
And of the three missed third-
down conversions for Michigan,
only one led to a punt.
The Wolverines' second scor-
ing drive was punctuated by
Michigan coach Brady Hoke's
decision to send the offense back
on the field after redshirt soph-
omore running back Fitzger-
ald Toussaint was stopped at
the line of scrimmage on third
down.
Hoke called a timeout and

gathered the specials teams unit
around him. At the last minute,
he motioned the offense back
onto the field.
"Coach Hoke, he gives us that
look and we tell him, 'Hey we
can get this,' " Robinson said.
"And that's what we do."
Robinson took the snap, fol-
lowed his blockers and danced
for a four-yard gain and a first
down.
Third down may be the
charm, but the fourth-down
conversions aren't so bad, either.
ONE MAN'S BOO-BOO ... :
Michigan fans know the feeling
all too well. It's a sinking, empty
feeling that settles in anytime
Denard Robinson leaves the
field injured.
Last season, Robinson left
10 of the Wolverines' 12 games
with some form of injury, creat-
ing a major void at quarterback.
Through five games this
season, Robinson hadn't been
forced out of a single play with
an injury. That streak ended
midway though the third quar-
ter in Evanston.
After a 12-yard run to the
Northwestern one-yard line,
Robinson ran off the field flexing
his left hand.
"It was nothing, a little boo-
boo," Robinson said after the
game.
Sophomore quarterback
Devin Gardner, who has played
sparingly this season - and
almost exclusively in two-quar-
terback sets - came on in Rob-
inson's absence.
On third down, Gardner ran
a bootleg right off a play-action
call and beat the defender to the
pylon to give Michigan the lead,
28-24.
Gardner finished the game by
completing his only two passes
for a total of 25 yards.
"Devin is a great quarter-
back," said senior running back
Michael Shaw. "It's tough being
behind Denard,but ... whenyour
number's called you have to be

Junior quarterback Denard Robinson helped Michigan overCome a slow start with four total touchdowns S

ready to perform, and that's why
you come to Michigan.
"Everybody on our roster can
play. Coach said all the time it's
not who's at the position, the
expectation is for the position,
so if your number is called you
gotta go in there and ball. That's
why you're here."
In his typical "Hokespeak,"
the head coach had a succinct
wrap-up of Gardner's perfor-
mance.
"Good," Hoke said. "It was
good to see Devin be very quar-
terback-like."
SAFETY COMES STANDARD:
Redshirt sophomore safety
Thomas Gordon entered his
recruitment process with every
intention of being a quarterback.
Redshirt junior safety Jordan
Kovacs was walk-on three years
ago.
Somehow, the misfit second-
ary has combined to be one of

the more lethal safety duos in
the Big Ten.
Gordon and Kovacs each have
a pick and have combined for
four turnovers in six games.
Early in the fourth quarter
against Northwestern, Gordon
stripped Wildcat wide receiver
Jeremy Ebert and fell on the
loose ball.
On the ensuing Northwest-
ern possession, Kovacs made
his presence felt. Persa lined
the Wildcats up on fourth down
from the Michigan 37-yard line,
tryingto reducethe 11-point def-
icit. Persa looked left, then right,
but he didn't look over the top.
As Persa went through his
play call at the line, Kovacs crept
up toward the line of scrim-
mage. And when Persa took the
ball, Kovacs came hard on the
blitz.
The guard and tackle
split. When Persa looked up,

Kovacs was three steps away,
untouched. As Kovacs lowered
his shoulder for another of his
devastating hits, Persa ducked.
Kovacs blew the helmet right
off the quarterback, who stayed
up and tried to scramble. But the
play was whistled dead. Ten-
yard sack, Michigan ball.
Northwestern coach Pat
Fitzgerald was furious that
Kovacs wasn't called for grab-
bing Persa's facemask - Fitzger-
ald received a 15-yard penalty
for arguing the call.
"You know, I've got to worry
about three kids' college funds,
so I'm going to leave it at that,
how does that sound?" Fitzger-
ald said.
No more arguing from the
coach, but he wasn't pleased.
But no penalty was called and
Kovacs was credited with the
sack, effectively ending the
Wildcats' chances.

skating right then nothing hap-
pens."
That cuteness is a reference
back to Friday's self-proclaimed
slump. The Falcons' early first
goal on Friday night was unan-
swered by the Wolverines until
the second stanza, when senior
defenseman Greg Pateryn
tipped in a shot deflected off
Bentley netminder Kyle Rank.
And even though Michigan
walked away with four more
goals after that, it didn't always
play like the better team. The
Wolverines knew nothing about
Bentley going into the week-
end's series, but after Friday,
they became first-hand witness-
es to the Falcons' unexpected
speed. When Bentley picked up
its pace in the second period,
Michigan became sloppy.
Over-passing was a prob-
lem for the Wolverines, but the
over-skating was an even big-
ger one. The players aren't sure
what exactly its origins are

ines' first touchdown of the half,
but maybe more importantly, it
immediately deflated the Wild-
cats' confidence. In the first half,
Northwestern intercepted Rob-
inson three times and held the
potent Michigan offense in check.
"When you're working so hard
to stop an offense and you do it
consistently on a play-by-play
basis, and then they hit a big one
on you, it really hits you hard,"
said Northwestern coach Pat
Fitzgerald.
"It kills you."
Roundtree wasn't the only
Michigan receiver who had suc-
cess on the jump ball.
On just his second pass attempt
of the game, Robinson spotted
fifth-year senior wide receiver
Junior Hemingway streaking
down the middle of the field and
launched the ball high into the
seasonably warm autumn air,
allowing Hemingway justenough
time to adjust his body and come
down with the 48-yard reception.
"I looked back, I saw (Robin-
son) moving up in the pocket,"
Hemingway said. "I was wonder-
ing, 'I wonder if he's gonna run?'
He threw it and I thought, 'Oh
man, yes!'
"I just went up and made aplay
on it, because I knew we needed
it."
Robinson wasn't surprised.
Hemingway came down with the
ball.
"I mean, Junior's always going
to make big plays," Robinson
said. "I think he's one of the best
receivers in the country."
Hemingway and redshirt
sophomore Jeremy Gallon led the
Wolverines with five receptions

year.
Michigan was a season-best
14-of-17 on third downs - a huge
part of that success came from
the receivers' ability to make
plays when the Wolverines need-
ed them most.
And that ability was a big rea-
son Michigan was able to come
out of Evanston with its first road
victory of the year.
"Just doing what we're sup-
posed to do," Hemingway said.
"Executing our plays, making the
blocks when we're supposed to
make them."
But it's what doesn't show
up on the stat sheet that keeps
receivers like Roundtree on the
field when they're struggling to
make receptions.
"Football's notjust, as a receiv-
er, 'I'm gonna catch the ball, and
if I'm not catching the ball I'm
unhappy,' " said senior running
back Michael Shaw. "(Roundtree)
blocks his butt off every play.
Catching is what he does well,
but blocking is also what he does
great."
It's always nice to get recep-
tions, but for Roundtree and this
Michigan team, they don't care
about who does what - and that
may be the biggest reason for the
Wolverines success so far this
season.
"(Roundtree) keeps working
the same way in practice no mat-
ter what, and that's why I think
we win, because we've got a lot
of unselfish guys," Shaw said.
"Things might not go their way,
but they keep grinding it out
because you never know when
your number's gonna be called.
"And when it's called, you
have to perform."

The turnovers were neces-
sary only because of North-
western's level of play in the
first half. Outside of a first-
drive three and out, North-
western bent the Wolverines
defense to its will. The Wild-
cats scored on four of their
seven first-half drives. Michi-
gan's players admitted the
upbeat tempo caused some
confusion early on.
Persa used the opportunity
to beat them through the air,
and the option run beat them

LOOKING GOOD

FIFTH-YEAR SENIOR JUNIOR
HEMINGWAY: Junior "the jump-
ball king" Hemingway added to his
collection early inthe first quarter
by snagging a 48-yard pass away
from a Northwestern cornerback.
The play set up Michigan's first
touchdown of the game. He also
had two more catches that went
for more than 20 yards. Halfway
through the season, Hemingway
can add another title to his name:
Go-To Receiver. He had five
receptions and his second 100-
yard game of the season. He's
the only receiver to eclipse the
century mark this season and the
only to catch five passes in a game.
After struggling with injuries for
most of his career, Hemingway is
finally healthy. In a year where the
passing game has been criticized
more than it has been praised,
Denard Robinson is thankful for
the 6-foot-1, 225-pound reciever.

THE MICHIGAN RUNNING
BACKS: Sure, redshirt sophomore
Fitzgerald Toussaint got 14
carries, but he had just 25 yards.
His other two counterparts,
senior Mike Shaw and junior
Vincent Smith, combined for nine
carries and -33 yards. While the
running backs may be "Feeling
Blue" because of their numbers,
they have something else to be
sorry about. Sometimes they're
not needed in the running game.
Denard Robinson has carried the
rushing load more and more as the
season has wore on. Remember
when Brady Hoke said he wanted
Robinson to run about 15 times
a game? Robinson has rushed
more than 20 times in three of
the past four games. By the end
of the season, the running backs
may be better known for their
blocking than their rushing. That's
all Michigan needs these days.
