UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
Two 'U
satellites
launched
into space
Student-built
devices to collect
data for NASA
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily Staff Reporter
Two University student-built satel-
lites; one about the size of a small tissue
box and the other slightly larger than a
loaf of bread, were launched into space
from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in
California early this morning.
The satellites, Radio Aurora Explor-
er-2 and M-Cubed, succeeded the
student-built Radio Aurora Explor-
er-i, which launched from Alaska last
November.
RAX-2 and M-Cubed will conduct
tests for officials at NASA. The RAX-2
will collect data on plasma density irreg-
ularities in the ionosphere, an upper
layer of the Earth's atmosphere. The
M-Cubed will test the Virtex-5 Field-
Programmable Gate Array, an image-
processing instrument.
Undergraduate and graduate students
have been working under the direction
of faculty adviser James Cutler, assistant
professor of aerospace engineering and
atmospheric, oceanic and space science,
to design, build and test' the satellites
in North Campus labs. RAX-2 has been
in development since January and the
M-Cubed since 2007.
University alum Allison Craddock,
engineering support manager for the
RAX-2 team, said data collected from
the RAX-2 will improve students' under-

For the Daily
For the first time in the history of
the Michigan Green Chemistry Gover-
nor's Award, the governor presented the
award to the recipients.
At the third annual Michigan Green
Chemistry and Engineering Confer-
ence at the University's North Campus
Research Complex yesterday, Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder presented the award
in three categories - academics, small
business and large business - to winners
from across the state.
The conference works to bridge the
gap between research conducted by the
private sector and public institutions.
Sponsored by the Michigan Department
of Environmental Quality, the confer-
ence also aims to facilitate discussions
abouthowtoturnresearch and ideasinto
marketable products.
In his speech to the crowd of about
200 researchers and business leaders,
Snyder stressed the importance of rein-
venting Michigan's economy with green
technology.
"Green chemistry is fundamentally
about innovation ... and the best part
about these new ideas is that they're not
just new ideas that are entertaining, but
they're new ideas that can make a differ-
ence in people's lives," he said.

Law aims to curb illegal
alcohol sales, to take
effect Nov.1
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
For University students accus-
tomed to buying kegs of beer with the
help of older friends or the possession
of fake IDs, this Halloween might be a
last hurrah.
A state law set to take effect Tues-
day will require retailers to attach a
tag with the buyer's name, address,
phone number and state ID number

to each keg they sell. The measure is
intended to curb underage drinking
and put responsibility on keg retail-
ers. However, Ann Arbor keg sellers
say the law could undermine their
businesses.
Under the law, which passed with
bipartisan support in the state Legis-
lature last December, retailers must
keep records of keg sales for at least
one year. The records will be open to
police and other local law enforce-
ment officials for inspection at any
time.
Additionally, a person who removes
a tag from a keg may face as many as
93 days in jail and a fine of more than
$500.

State Rep. Mark Meadows (D-
East Lansing) said the law creates a
paper trail for police to hold the buyer
accountable in case officers discover
that a keg was illegally given to an
underage person.
"It was prompted by problems that
we had in the community in terms of
identifying the individual who's really
responsible for the problem," he said.
Meadows said establishments
that illegally sell alcohol to minors
are particular targets of the legisla-
tion. He added that the law passed
at the urging of many of the state's
public universities, but the Univer-
sity of Michigan was not among them,

This weekend, hoards of students
will roam the streets of Ann Arbor
dressed as celebrities, witches, ani-

while wearing costumes comprised of
tight and revealing clothing.
Emily Richard, shift manager at
American Apparel on Rast Liberty
Street, said the store fills with shop-
pers searchingfor the perfect costume
in the week leading up to Halloween
- the store's busiest time of the year.
Though American Apparel doesn't
offer packaged costumes, she said it
sells enough metallic spandex and
lacy leotards to meet the demand of
students trying to complete theircol-
legiate Halloween ensemble.
Richard said she thinks female stu-
dents often opt for more revealing cos-

Before Auto-Tune and an odd sense

In the 1970s, University alum Rich-

LSA freshman Abby Lyng and Engi-

having the perfect costume is a one-

students often compete for recogni-

their costumes.

Lyng said she dislikes dressing up in

Idaho professor discussed shooting
students before killing graduate

University professor
committed suicide
after killing 22 year
old he dated
BOISE, Idaho (AP) - A Uni-
versity of Idaho professor who
committed suicide after killing
a graduate student he had dated
previously talked about shooting
students in his classroom and was
targeted in a complaint alleging
he was engaging in "sex orgies"
with students, according to newly
released documents.
The slain graduate student,
Katy Benoit, 22, complained to
university officials in June that
assistant psychology professor
Ernesto Bustamante had pointed
a gun at her three times. Benoit
was urged to take safety precau-

tions and go to police.
Another student evaluating
Bustamante last fall complained
his teaching was erratic and thathe
had discussed shooting students. In
December, a complaint called into
a university hotline accused Busta-
mante of having sex with students
and coercing one into having sex
with him and others.
University officials have
defended their response to Ben-
oit's complaint, saying they
contacted Moscow police imme-
diately after she came forward.
They told law enforcement that
a student had been involved in a
domestic violence issue but did
not detail Benoit's allegations.
University spokeswoman Tania
Thompson said under school poli-
cy, Bustamante first had a chance
to respond to the complaint,
which he was served in early July
after university officials received

permission from Benoit.
"He, at that point, has a right
to respond to those allegations,"
Thompson said.
Bustamante denied Benoit's
allegations and told administra-
tors that they had a friendship
that had dissolved after she stole
prescription pills from him. Ben-
oit later told university officials
she "screwed up" the relationship
by stealing the pills, but she was
really scared after he threatened
herwith agun.
Bustamante resigned his posi-
tion effective Aug. 19, and three
days later, police said he shot Ben-
oit nearly a dozen times outside
her Moscow home. Bustamante
committed suicide in a hotel room
shortly after shooting Benoit and
was found with six guns and med-
ications for bipolar disorder and
severe anxiety, police said.
Bustamante, who had been
known to alternately refer to
himself as a "psychopathic kill-
er" and "the beast," disclosed he
took medication for bipolar dis-
order shortly after he was hired
in 2007. As early as the fall of
his first semester, three or four
students went to psychology
department chairman Ken Locke
to express concerns about Busta-
mante's behavior, saying he was
"flirtatious" and showed favorit-
ism to students.
Benoit had met Bustamante in
the fall of 2010 when she took a
psychology course he was teach-
ing, and by the end of the semes-
ter, they were dating.
During student evaluations
of Bustamante that fall, another
student complained about the
professor's behavior.
"He talked about shooting
students, which was disturbing,
and implied that he was (and we
should be) drunk and high every
other day," said the student, who
is not identified in the teaching
evaluations.
In December 2010, Bustaman-
te met with administrators to
discuss a complaint that an anon-
ymouscaller put into a univer-
sity hotline, saying Bustamante
was having sexual relationships
with students.

Though there might be a

those things are overplayed."

its enemy, the Hamas militant
group that rules Gaza - a tiny
coastal Palestinian territorythat
borders both countries.
Egypt's improved ties with
Hamas appear to have helped
secure a long-elusive prisoner
swap last week, in which Israel
agreed to trade more than 1,000
Palestinian prisoners for a single
Israeli soldier, Sgt. Gilad Schalit,
who was captured and held by
Hamas in Gaza for more than
five years.
But Grapel is no Schalit.
He was volunteering at a legal
aid group in Cairo when he was
arrested in early June on suspi-
cion of spying for Israel during the
grass roots revolt that overthrew
Mubarak. He was never charged.
Grapel made no secret of his
Israeli background, entered
Egypt under his real name and
his Facebook page had photos
of him in an Israeli military
uniform. Such openness about
his identity suggested he was
not a spy, and even in Egypt,
where hostility toward Israel
runs high, the arrest was wide-
ly ridiculed.

Spending on
elections threatens
judicial impartiality
WASHINGTON (AP) - Inter-
est groups pumped millions of dol-
lars into state judicial elections at
unprecedented levels around the
country inthe last election cycle, a
trend that threatens to undermine
the impartiality of judges, a report
issued yesterday said.
Political parties and advocacy
groups working independently
from the candidates are account-
ing for a greater share of spending
on judicial elections. Such inde-
pendent expenditures accounted
for $11.5 million, or nearly 30 pei-
cent, of the money spent in the
2009-2010 election cycle. That's
up more than 60 percent from the
2005-06 election cycle.
That growth helps explain the
nasty tone of some judicial elec-
tions.While candidates ran mostly
positive advertisements, interest
groups accounted for three out
of every four attack ads, said the
report, which was compiled by
three organizations, including the
Brennan Center for Justice at New
York University School of Law.
"The story of the 2009-10 elec-
tions, and their aftermath in state
legislatures in 2011, reveals a
coalescing national campaign that
seeks to intimidate America's state
judges into becoming accountable
to money and ideologies instead of
the constitution and the law," said
the report.
High-court candidates across
the U.S. spent $38.4 million dur-
ing the 2009-2010 election cycle.
Retention races in four states -
Illinois, Iowa, Alaska and Colo-
rado - cost nearly $4.9 million,
more than double the $2.2 million
for all retention elections nation-
wide for the entire decade.
The most expensive high-court
elections took place in Michigan,
Pennsylvania and Illinois, where
the courts were closely divided
along party lines.
The nation's costliest reten-
tion election in a quarter century
took place last year when Illinois
Chief Justice Thomas Kilbride
faced a simple up-or-down vote
to keep his seat. Business groups

sought his ouster after he helped
overturn a state law capping dam-
ages in medical malpractice cases.
Kilbride raised $2.8 million while
businessgroups drew $688,000 in
their campaign.
In Michigan, the state GOP
spent an estimated $4 million and
the Michigan Democratic Party
spent $1.6 million. The report
said the independent spending
dwarfed that of the candidates,
to the point that the candidates
"seemed like bystanders in their
own elections." The judicial elec-
tions in Michigan were the most
expensive in the country.
Perhaps the most abrupt
change took place in Iowa where
not a single penny was spent in
state high-court elections from
2000 to 2009. That changed when
the Iowa Supreme Court struck
down a state law banning same-
sex marriage. Nationalgroups, led
by the National Organization for
Marriage, spent nearly $1 million
to vote out three state justices try-
ing to retain their seats. A group
called Fair Courts for Us, led by
former governor Robert Ray,
also spent about $400,000 in an
unsuccessful bid to support the
incumbents.
The report described the
results of the Iowa election as
chilling because the campaign
was intended to send a warning to
judges in all states.
But Brian Brown, president
of the National Organization for
Marriage, said he believes talk of
intimidation by interest groups is
just incorrect. Rather, he said, that
the groups are putting their trust
in voters.
"Is it intimidation when some-
one saysto a politician you've gone
too far. I can't vote for you again?"
Brown said. "That's not intimida-
tion. That's democracy at work."
The report also noted that a
patchwork of disclosure laws
can leave the public in the doubt
about who funds the indepen-
dent expenditure efforts to elect
or remove judicial candidates.
In Iowa, the laws made it clear
who was supporting the effort
to remove three justices. But in
Michigan, the report said it was
impossible to confirm who bank-
rolled the two party's spending
in the judicial elections.


Amid criticism, Perry drops
out of upcomillg debates

Ohio gym teacher
convicted of having
sex with students

Gov. will not join
debate at Oakland
University
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Rick
Perry may skip some upcoming
GOP presidential debates, side-
stepping a campaign staple that
hasn't been kind to the Texas
governor in his first two months
on the national stage. It's a deci-
sion that ultimately could cause
other Republicans to bow out of
the more than half-dozen face-
offs scheduledbetween now and
the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3.
Perry does plan to participate
in a Nov. 9 debate at Oakland
University in Rochester, Mich.
- his sixth - but he hasn't com-
mitted to any others beyond
that as political advisers hunker
down to determine how best to
proceed. He's juggling fundrais-
ing and retail campaigning with
only two months before the first
votes in the Republican nomina-
tion fight are cast.
"We haven't said no, but
we're looking at each debate,"
campaign spokesman Mark
Miner said yesterday. "There are
numerous - 15, 16, 17 - debates,
and we're taking a look at each
one and we're makingthe appro-
priate consideration."
He said that "while debates
are part of the process, they're
just one part."
Former Massachusetts Gov.
Mitt Romney, considered the
Republican candidate to beat
because of his leads in national
polls, fundraising and organi-
zation, also has not committed
to debating beyond Michigan.
His campaign has made debate

commitments on a case-by-case
basis depending on how each fits
his schedule and strategy. For
instance, he skipped the leadoff
debate in South Carolina in June
when the GOP field was stillgell-
ing and few top-tier candidates
participated.
For Perry, who is not nearly as
well-known as Romney, there's
more to it than time manage-
ment.
As he reboots his fledgling
campaign, Perry clearly also is
trying to reintroduce himself
to the nation on his own terms.
After a couple of recent rocky
debate performances hurt his
poll standings, he's returning to
the play-it-safe strategy he suc-
cessfully employed in running
threetimesforgovernorofTexas.
The state's longest-serving
governor, he never has lost an
election and has debated his
rivals only when it couldn't be
avoided. Perry has long conced-
ed he's not a strong debater, and
he contends that his up-close
charisma and ability to take
a more personalized message
directly to voters is the key to
his success. His closest advisers
have built campaigns around
that approach and their candi-
date's ferocious campaign-trail
energy.
It's unclear whether this
approach will work in a nation-
al campaign, where debates
provide candidates new to the
national stage with a huge dose
of free media as they look to
make themselves better known
to primary voters. The stakes
are high. Do well, and you could
enjoy a burst of momentum as
Minnesota Rep. Michele Bach-
mann did over the summer. Do

poorly, andyou riskfallingout'of
favor as Perry can attest.
This year, the Republican pri-
mary debates have drawn large
audiences and have significantly
shaped the contours of the race.
Eight debates already have been
held, and nearly a dozen more
are scheduled before January's
end.
Media companies and state
Republican Party leaders sched-
ule them without the campaigns'
consent. It's up to the candidates
to decide whether they partici-
pate.
Perry has made his disdain for
the encounters clear.
"These debates are set up for
nothing more than to tear down
the candidate," he said Tuesday
on The O'Reilly Factor on Fox
News Channel. "So, you know, if
there was a mistake made, it was
probably ever doing one of the
(debates) when all they're inter-
ested in is stirring up between
the candidates instead of really
talking about the issues that
are important to the American
people."
Rival campaigns jumped on
Perry.
"You have to go to debates if
you want to succeed in the new
era," chided Steve Grubbs, chair-
man of Herman Cain's Iowa
campaign.
But Republican strategist
Ford O'Connell, a former aide
to John McCain's 2008 presi-
dential campaign, said Perry
must play to his strength, not his
weakness.
"During those debates, he
looks like the Washington Gen-
erals while Mitt Romney is the
Harlem Globetrotters scoring
all around him," O'Connell said.

Judge rejects
teacher's insanity
plea for having sex
with five students
LEBANON, Ohio (AP) - A
high school teacher was convict-
ed yesterday of having sex with
five students, some of them foot-
ball players, after an Ohio judge
rejected an insanity defense that
argued the teens took advantage
of her.
Stacy Schuler was sentenced to
a total of four years in prison for
the encounters with the Mason
High School students at her home
in Springboro in southwest Ohio
in2010. She can ask ajudge to free
her from prison after six months.
The 33-year-old Schuler, who
could have faced decades in pris-
on, cried as she was handcuffed
and led out of the courtroom.
The five'teens testified that
Schuler, a health and gym teach-
er, had been drinking alcohol at
the time of the encounters and
was a willing participant who ini-
tiated much of the contact. The
teens were about 17 at the time.
The age of consent in Ohio is 16,
but it's illegal for a teacher to have
sex with a student.
"This is a noble profession
that you have, and I've heard a
lot of good things about you, but
I know that you had the opportu-
nity, as all teachers do, to affect
the lives of our children," War-
ren County Common Pleas Judge
Robert Peeler said. "You crossed
a line."

Schuler's lawyers argued that
she had medical and psychologi-
cal issues and couldn't remember
the encounters.
Before sentencing Schuler on
16 counts of sexual battery and
three counts of providing alcohol
to a minor, the judge said it would
be a "magnificent leap" to believe
she didn't know her actions were
wrong.
Schuler didn't testify during
the four-day nonjury trial, and
she and her attorneys declined to
address the judge before he sen-
tenced her.
But parents of two of the teen
victims made tearful statements.
A father spoke of his son's
depression and lost motivation
and said the teen almost didn't
go to college. He asked the judge
to hand down a sentence to send
a message that Schuler's acts are
not acceptable and there are seri-
ousconsequences.
"it impacts the teaching com-
munity as a whole, how a single
teacher who made the wrong
decision multiple times overshad-
ows 99.9 percent of the teachers
that truly do care, not pretend
to care, about their students," he
said.
A mother said her son turned
to and trusted Schuler during an
extremely low period when his
father had cancer and related
health problems.
"These young men may appear
pas if they are tough guys, but in
reality, they are truly hurting,"
she said.
"She took advantage of their
vulnerability. She crossed the line
and it is unacceptable."

A virtual problem
State funding should be given to public schools
W hile cyber schools were once an idea of science fiction,
online learning has recently become more widely accept-
ed. Cyber schools - which allow students to take classes
on the Internet - are a beneficial alternative for students who don't
learn at the same speed as their peers. Though cyber schools are a
new resource that should be explored, public schools are struggling
and should be the government's first priority. The money in the gov-
ernment's educational budget should first fund public schools rather
than help develop cyber schools.

Another case for sustainability

State Senate Bill 619 lifts enrollment
restrictions on cyber schools in Michigan.
The bill will allot the same amount of per-
student funding as public schools and help
develop cyber schools substantially. How-
ever, cyber schools do not perform as well
academically. K-12 Inc. is the largest online
education group and partners with many
public schools. The group had only 25 percent
of its 24 schools meet the Adequate Yearly
Progress measurement - which determines
academic success based on standardized
tests under the No Child Left Behind stan-
dard - according to the National Education
Policy Center's 2009-2010 annual report.
Innovation in the education system is cru-
cial to increase the effectiveness of all Michi-
gan schools. However, more research needs
to be conducted before placing students in
front of a screen every day. Pennsylvania and
Ohio have thousands of students enrolled in
online schools, but their success is limited.
Though there are obvious problems in the
current public school system, these can be
remedied through additional education fund-
ing. Overfilled classrooms and program cuts

are hurtingschools throughoutthe state, and
government officials need to address these
immediate problems before investing money
in cyber schools. Integrating online learning
into traditional classrooms is a better use for
the money than giving it directly to cyber
schools. This could encourage true innova-
tion and help a larger number of students
than the few that benefit from cyber schools.
If there is money immediately available,
it should first go toward the state's pub-
lic school system. However, cyber schools
should not be completely ignored. In the
future, they may become a viable alternative
to traditional schooling. For certain students,
online courses- can be more effective than
traditional classrooms.
The current education system has many
issues that are worsened by the elimination
of programs and increased class sizes. It is
important for the nation to explore innova-
tive schooling options, but not at the expense
of traditional public schools. If there is avail-
able educational funding, it should primarily
be distributed to the public schools that edu-
cate the majority of Michigan's students.

L6 inish your food - there
are starving kids in Afri-
ca." I know I've been
told this numer-
ous times. I also
know that more
often than not,
I've retorted,
"Yeah, well it's
not like I can
send it to them
anyway." And, M HA
I'm sure many NAHATA
of you have also.
But cliche rep-
rimands aside,
the unequal distribution of Earth's
scarce resources is becoming an
increasingly serious issue - an issue
that will be even more pressing in
the upcoming years based on the
recently released United Nations
statistics regarding population
growth.
According to a recent U.N. popu-
lation report, the world population
will hit 7 billion on Monday. In 1998,
there were 6 billion people in the
world, meaning that this last billion
was added in just 12 years. What's
more, by the end of the century the
population is expected to cross 10
billion. Needless to say, this is a lot
of people being added at a fast pace.
With so many people, sustain-
ability is an obvious problem. The
question becomes: Does the Earth
have enough resources to provide
for such a rapidly growing popula-
tion? As an Oct. 23 Guardian article
puts it, "Every additional person
needs food, water and energy, and
produces more waste and pollution."
Moreover, in a world dependent on
industrialization, our ability to
manufacture and produce adequate
amounts of food is directly related to
our access to fossil fuels - a resource
we all know is quickly depleting.
However, there is good news. In
an Oct. 23 New York Times op-ed,

mathematical biologist Joel Cohen
reassures that we will indeed be
fine in the short term. The Earth
is capable of feeding, housing and
providing for many more than 7 bil-
lion people, at least in the foresee-
able future. This is largely thanks
to advances in technology, which
allow us to make more with less.
But that isn't to say there aren't sig-
nificant long-term problems associ-
ated with large population growth,
namely in regard to management
and distribution of the Earth's
resources.
The mainproblemisthatalthough
there are enough resources - food,
water, a place to live - to support
every individual on the planet,
most of these resources aren't used
to provide basic necessities. Cohen
reports that each year the Earth
produces enough grain to support
upwards of 9 to 11 billion individu-
als. And, yet, almost 1 billion people
still go hungry. This is because only
46 percent of the grain produced is
used to feed people - the rest goes
to feeding livestock. At the rate the
world population is growing, this
mismanagement of resources will
make it more and more difficult to
provide for everyone.
Another issue is that resources
are disproportionately concentrat-
ed in relation to population. It is
no secret that access to resources
is highly concentrated in the West.
Underdeveloped countries, on the
other hand, tend to have extremely
dense populations and little to no
access to resources. Cohen reit-
erates that in the future, water
shortages will be prominent in
Northern Africa, India and China.
Coincidentally, these regions are
also undergoing the fastest popula-
tion growth. Eventually, this trend
presents a situation where the areas
with the most people to take care
of will be forced to do so with the

least resources. Needless to say,
this poses future geopolitical and
national security threats.
But, again, what does this have
to do with us in the West? We have
the resources. We're not surviving
on $2 a day or going hungry. So, why
should we worry? Well, if ever there
was a case for sustainability - for
conserving resources, for reducing
wasteful consumption, for recycling
- it is now. And, if ever there was a
place where wasteful consumption
needed to be reigned in, it is here.
Regardless of whether or not you
believe in climate change, there has
never been a larger need for envi-
ronmentally friendly initiatives - if
for no other reason than the fact that
the demand for resources will con-
tinue to increase, while Earth's lim-
ited supply inevitably runs out.
Can the Earth
handle 7 billion
people Monday?
There are enough resources out
there to provide for everyone - all
7 billion of us - as long as they are
used efficiently. It's not necessarily
that there are starving kids in Africa
that would like to eat your half-eaten
dinner; it's that what went into feed-
ing you, could also have been used
to feed them. Go green, not because
it's trendy or because global warm-
ing will wipe out Los Angeles if you
don't (though that might very well
happen), but because it's the only
way to sustain humanity in light of
how fast it is growing.

Life's too short

The passing of our Michigan Marching
Band member and friend, Patrick Fleming, on
Monday, Sep. 26, 2011, was a shock to all of us.
A second-year member of the trumpetsection,
Fleming died in a car accident while driving
to classes at the University's Flint campus. He
was an intensely dedicated Michigan March-
ing Band member, who worked late at night at
a senior center, drove to classes in Flint and
rushed back to Ann Arbor each day for our
rehearsals. Also an extremely likeable person,
Fleming always wore a gleaming smile.
Of course, nothing prepares you for some-
thing like this. Upon hearing the news of his
passing, we immediately informed the admin-
istration of the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance as well as the University Dean of Stu-
dents. The Division of Student Affairs imme-
diately assembled a team to speak with our
band members, informing them of the vari-
ous counseling options available. I will never
forget how our band members held onto each
other and took care of each other in the days
and weeks that followed. It was one of the sad-
dest experiences imaginable, but it was also so
very inspirational.
Within a day of learning of the news,
longtime marching band supporter Donald
Shepherd established a new scholarship in
Fleming's name, to be awarded to a deserv-
ing student each year, beginning in the fall of
2012. On the day of the accident, both Univer-
sity Athletic Director Dave Brandon and head
football coach Brady Hoke called us to express
their condolences. Hoke also attended Flem-
ing's visitation service the following week.
Before we could even ask, Brandon suggested
that we have a moment of silence before the
National Anthem at that weekend's football
game. Fleming's spot in the marching drill was
left vacant during our performances that day.
Two days following Fleming's accident,
several members of the Michigan State Uni-
versity, the Ohio State University and the
Eastern Michigan University Marching
Bands appeared at our rehearsal with signed
cards of support. The Spartan Marching
Band had assembled 'the previous day and
produced a DVD of them performing Amaz-
ing Grace for us. The Ohio State band mem-
bers, who made an eight-hour round trip to
be with us that day, presented us with a drum
major baton specially engraved with a dedi-
cation to Fleming. These students had also
reached out to the other Big Ten marching

bands, collected flowers and cards of sympa-
thy, and gave them to us at our rehearsal that
afternoon. I'll never forget the looks in our
students' faces as this unbelievable show of
support was taking place.
During the week that followed, e-mails,
phone calls and cards appeared from all of the
Big Ten bands, other Michigan universities
and university bands from across the country,
including the Universities in Georgia, Texas
and Florida, to name just a few. A moment of
silence for Fleming was given duringthe Skull
Session at OSU that Saturday and also at the
University of Michigan v. Northwestern game
the following weekend. The Northwestern
University Marching Band had wristbands
made that were inscribed with "We Are With
You." These wristbands combined their pur-
ple with our maize-and-blue and were worn
by their band duringtheir game against Mich-
igan. Michigan Marching Band members who
traveled to Evanston that day were presented
with wristbands to bring home for every mem-
ber of our band.
This outpouring of support from our broth-
ers and sisters throughout the band world has
left us all in awe of the activity in which we're
involved. At a time when poor sportsmanship
and over-the-top competitiveness can domi-
nate in football rivalries, we were reminded
this season that human kindness and compas-
sion exist and thrive in our band community.
None of us will ever look at another univer-
sity marching band through the same lens as
before, and hopefully we'll all cheer just a little
bit louder when given the opportunity.
So, Michigan fans, perhaps this might
inspire more of us to reconsider our approach
to game days in the Big House. Maybe booing
our student visitors from other schools is con-
tradictory to what we call the "Michigan Dif-
ference." Maybe chanting "You Suck" during
and at the end of the Michigan Band's tradi-
tional "Temptation" is notthe class act that we
claim to uphold in Ann Arbor. Maybe "killing
our visitors with kindness" would be a better
plan of attack than demonstrating the kind of
poor sportsmanship witnessed too often in
athletic arenas these days. Life is too fragile
and too short to waste with negativity and ill
intentions. Go Blue!

Freting au thefutur

a

Two years ago, I wrote a
column entitled "Major-
ly Undecided," in which
I expressed my confusion about
choosing a major
and my appre-
hension in doing
so. Jump for-
ward to this year,
and I now face
the same strug-
gle, only this
time in relation LEAH
to career paths. POTKIN
I have, thank-
fully, made some
progress since my 2009 column: I
declared myself as an English major
and applied for graduation. How-
ever, in applying for graduation, I
couldn't help but be reminded of the
question looming overhead: What
will I do when I graduate?
In the same way I saw declar-
ing a major as a struggle, I now see
"declaring" a profession as one.
More and more often I hear stu-
dents say they have no idea what
they want to do, yet more and more
often the question is asked. Howev-
er, struggling students should not be
discouraged by their lack of direc-
tion, but rather should be excited
about all the opportunities they
have waiting for them in that "real"
world once game days and nights at
the UGLi are things of the past. It's
certainly not easy to think this way,
especially in this highly competi-
tive academic environment, but it's
essential in order to keep our heads
above water inthis brutal hunt - the
career hunt, that is.
I am well aware that there are the
lucky few students in majors such as
business and engineering who are

less affected by this struggle, and,
in many cases, already know where
they'll be working next year and
their likely career paths. However,
the majority ofstudents in social sci-
ences and the like share in the strug-
gle, and many in the latter group are
envious of students in the former
group - not because they have jobs,
but because they know what career
they would like to pursue.
Recently, however, I realized
that my current inability to answer
the daunting "what do you want to
do" question is not as terrible as it
seems. The chances are slim that my
first job will be in the same field I
end up working in, and it's vital that
I stop thinking of my first job out of
college as determining the rest of my
life. I didn't realize the unnecessary
stress I've caused myself by thinking
this way until recently, when I lis-
tened to a graduation speech given
by late Apple CEO Steve Jobs at
Stanford University. He spoke about
how hard it is to connect the dots
when you're in college, as it's nearly
impossible to comprehend how, and
if, things will ever line up. I, for one,
am guilty of trying to preemptively
connect the dots. Jobs's speech
reminded me - not to be clich6 -
how funny it is the way things work
out and how sometimes it is best to
allow things to happen rather than
fret about making them happen.
So for those of us about to jump
into the fray, it's essential to adopt
and maintain an optimistic and
open-minded attitude, despite the
setbacks and uncertainty that will
inevitably accompany our initial
employment quests. Remember,
thankfully, how young we gradu-
ates-to-be still are and that time is

on our side. I often hear people (my
parents) say that 60 is the new 50,
and frankly, I'm not one to argue.
My dad runs marathons, my mom
has more energy than I do and both
have yet to show signs of hearing
loss or memory lapse. But despite
being part of a generation in which
life expectancy is over age 80, it's
easy to feel old when life shifts from
a structured four-year path to a
windy and unpaved road. In reality,
we've lived hardly a quarter of our
lives, which leaves us plenty of time
to secure a career and connect those
scattered dots.
The dots might
not all connect
in college.
I'm not sayingstudents shouldn't
strive to achieve their best and
pursue their dream jobs as soon as
possible, but I am saying they don't
have to stress so much about it hap-
pening on day one. And while many
of us know that, I think the hard-
est part is accepting it as truth.
Because, really, who wouldn't
want to know what's in store for
the future? For now, however, it's
important to hold our heads high
and shamelessly embody inde-
cisiveness. It worked for me two
years ago, so I can only assume it
will work once again.

"Thou art a filthy toe rag and thy member is small of stature."
o beyon the Bard

Shakespeare's roots
aren't integral to
Anonymous'
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
Long after most of our names
have faded away, the words of
Shakespeare will remain fresh
on the lips
of the world,
whether or
not the Bard . y
penned all Anonymous
his celebrated AtQualityl6
works. But
what would Columbia
happen if one
of English literature's great
champions were not a man from
humble origins, but a nobleman?
What then were the words of
Hamlet, Prospero and Macbeth
supposed to mean?
According to director Roland
Emmerich's Â° "Anonymous" the
claimofauthorshipfor therevered
dramas belongs to Edward de
Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford.
In the film, the plays were writ-
ten during a time of uncertainty
with an obvious political agenda.
So instead of simply standing as
works of art, they're considered
artifacts of a conspiracy. What
follows is a taut, relentless story
that contains all the elements of
anepic tragedy.
During this tumultuous time,
Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Red-
grave, "Atonement") is under
the council of a powerful fam-
ily called the Cecils. In order to
protect their wealth, the Cecils
urge the queen to pronounce

King James of Scotland her
successor. To prevent such an
ascension and reveal the Cecils'
intentions, de Vere uses a man
named Shakespeare - a very
drunk Shakespeare - as a front-
man to release plays, at once
protecting himself and freeing
himself to take political jabs.
It should be noted the film
never opens with "Based on a
True Story." As such, "Anony-
mous" should be received as his-
torical fiction, not fact - which
may unfortunately dull its
potency as an argument against
Shakespeare. But then again,
we should be thankful that the
premise of the film - the tan-
talizing question of whether
Shakespeare was a fraud -
doesn't at all eclipse the story. So
while the film may not be cred-
ible academically, it neverthe-
less succeeds as a driven Tudors
political drama.
"Anonymous" knows only one
direction: forward. The plot's
vibrant pacing allows the audi-
ence to be enthralled by the
story's political intrigue and
passion, while wisely choosing
moments to paint an intimate
portrait of Edward de Vere.
As the Oxfordian champion,
Rhys Ifans ("Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows: Part 1")
walks the cold corridors with
heavy eyes, ink-stained hands,
but more importantly, the con-
fidence of a Renaissance genius.
Ifans conveys a weary knowl-
edge we never once dare dis-
pute, nor do we question his
passion. Above the groundlings,
he mouths out his plays' lines as
they are delivered on a wonder-
fully rendered stage, and when

the actors step forward to take
a bow he revels in the audience's
applause.
But Ifans only makes up a
half of de Vere's entire charac-
ter. The story is also deeply con-
cerned with his past, chiefly his
romance with Elizabeth I. Jamie
Bower's ("The Twilight Saga:
Breaking Dawn - Part 1") per-
formance as the young earl in
his mid-twenties completes the
film's de Vere as both a poet and
a lively nobleman trapped by the
duties of his social status.
Originally supposed to be
de Vere's frontman instead
of Shakespeare, Ben John-
son (Sebastian Armesto, "The
Tudors") and de Vere perhaps
share the most interesting
relationship. Caught between
envy and admiration, it eats at
Johnson to watch the plays, to
know de Vere's voice clearly
speaks volumes over his own.
Yet despite Johnson's compara-
tively incompetent skill, it's later
revealed that de Vere respects
him and yearns for his approval.
While the rest of the film is con-
cerned with political ambitions,
this aspect touches lightly on the
nature of writing but fortunately
manages to see enough screen
time to round the film out.
In the end, Johnson declares
de Vere "the soul of the age."
No matter who penned them,
Shakespeare's works have
climbed to the pinnacle of Eng-
lish thought and literature,
remaining an irrevocable part of
today's cultural capital. The film
inspires debate with an enter-
taining story and solid perfor-
mances, and helps to clarify and
refine the work of Shakespeare.

A phone is a lifeline, a solu-
tion to a problem. The power
these handheld devices possess
is remarkable and often taken
for granted. Students silently tap
their coveted Droids or iPhones
- strategically placed behind a
notebook or calculator - using
touch-screen technology to text,
check Facebook or just to stay
awake during lecture. But some
students at the University don't
take them for granted, because
they know what it's like to make
an app - from start to finish.
In the College of Engineering,
students enrolled in Electrical
Engineering and Computer Sci-
ence 441: Mobile App Develop-
ment for Entrepreneurs learn
about the importance of soft-
ware engineering by develop-
ing mobile applications and the
many opportunities glowing
beneath their fingertips. The
course educates students on how
the mobile landscape is formed,
and expects students to have
designed, tested and released a
functional mobile app by the end
of class.
The types of programs in the
class run the gamut from an app
called ASKMessaging, which
helps people struggling with
fine motor control type e-mails,
to an app called Boolinkr that
finds and sells used books, vid-
eogames or any product with a
barcode.
Roki Soeharyo, an LSA senior,
is taking EECS 441 this semes-
ter and is one of three students
working on Boolinkr. Accord-
ing to Soeharyo, users who have
Boolinkr will automatically
detect other devices that have
the app and are selling the prod-
uct the user is looking for.
"I think that there's a big
market for used books, video-
games, movies and whatnot,"
Soeharyo said. "People have
tried exchange programs before,
and this is just one way to trade
things locally."
ASKMessaging is a continua-
tion of a EECS 481 Winter 2011
semester project. EECS 481 is
another software engineering

Lawyer Richard Bernstein to
receive Neubacher Award for
raising disability awareness

'U' alum, professor
helped make
Michigan Stadium
more accessible
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
University alum Richard
Bernstein's work is reflected in
Detroit Metro Airport, Detroit
buses and even the Big House.
And tomorrow, his work will be
recognized by the University.
Bernstein, an attorney who
returned to his alma mater to
teach about social activism, will
receive the James T. Neubacher
Award tomorrow for his work
to raise awareness about dis-
abilities. Bernstein, who is blind,
focuses on pro bono cases repre-
senting people with disabilities.
Some of his successes include
improving disability access in
Detroit Metro Airport and the Big
House as well as making Detroit
buses wheelchair accessible.
The annual award is bestowed
upon a person affiliated with
the University who has raised

awareness and understanding
of disabilities. The Neubacher
Award, first presented in 1990,
is given in memory of University
alum James T. Neubacher, an
advocate for disability aware-
ness who died in 1990.
Anna Schnitzer, chairwoman
of the Neubacher Award Com-
mittee, said the award commit-
tee chose Bernstein because "he
has actually done so much (for
disability awareness)."
"He is so dynamic," Schnitzer
said.
Representing the Michigan
Paralyzed Veterans of America,
Bernstein filed a lawsuit against
the University in 2007 advocat-
ing for better wheelchair access
in Michigan Stadium. Though
the lawsuit was dropped, it
resulted in expanded wheelchair
accessible seating in the Big
House, which was included in
the renovations that were com-
pleted last year.
"Everyone can now look at the
Big House with a tremendous
sense of pride and excitement,"
Bernstein said. "The University
of Michigan stadium is now the
benchmark and is now the lead-
ing stadium for accessibility all

across the country."
Bernstein, who works at the
Farmington Hills, Mich.-based
Sam Bernstein Law Firm, said
that he was inspired to help peo-
ple with disabilities during his
time at Northwestern University
Law School.
"I used to pray every day that
God wouldgive (me)the strength
to make it through law school,"
Bernstein said. He said he prom-
ised God that if he became an
attorney, he would dedicate his
life to "trying to make life better
for people with disabilities and
special needs."
Bernstein said he looks for
cases in which people are "fac-
ing tremendous injustice and
tremendous hardship" and who
would otherwise go unrepre-
sented in court.
Bernstein said he hopes his
speech, which he will deliver
tomorrow when he receives the
award at Rackham Graduate
School, will "inspire and incite
folks to recognize the fact that
whatever it is they care about ...
that students find their purpose,
know why they were created and
live life with that kind of pas-
sion."

KEGS
From Page 1
according to University spokes-
man Rick Fitzgerald.
"The University of Michigan
did not actively lobby for passage
of the state's keg labeling law,"
Fitzgerald wrote in an e-mail
interview.
Even as Meadows and other
state legislators applauded the
law, which will make Michigan
the 31st state to mandate keg tags,
other lawmakers questioned how
effective it will be in reducing
underage binge drinking.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said he is unsure if local
law enforcement will actually
examine whether every keg is
tagged and whether every retail-
er maintains accurate records.
Irwin said he is "skeptical"
the law will have a pronounced
impact since it will likely incrim-
inate more retailers for selling
alcohol to minors but looks past
underage demand of the prod-
uct. He added that minors binge
drink due to a lack of education
and discourse with adults about
responsible alcohol consump-

tion.
"I think that this is prob-
ably not the best way to address
underage drinking," Irwin said.
"I think it creates this wall
between young people and the
responsible people in their lives
who may be able to guide them in
the right direction."
Irwin added that the law
could also increase the appeal
of binge drinking for under-
age people. The government is
not capableof en\ding underage
drinking, he said, and legisla-
tion that aims to reduce access to
alcohol for minors inspires more
demand.
"If it makes it sort of more
difficult for young people to get
their hands on it, I think it does
increase the impetus for some
young people to go overboard
and to abuse it to excess," Irwin
said. "People who are under 21
will always find a way to access
alcohol if they want to."
Eddie Galyana, owner of
Strickland's Market on Geddes
Avenue, said he believes the law
"doesn't make sense" because it
will increase sales of liquor and
other alcoholic products besides
beer.

"The people who buy the
kegs - they're actually going to
turn around and buy different
things,"'Galyana said.
Galyana said he expects his
store's keg sales to decrease by
about 10 to 15 percent once the
legislation starts next week.
"I'm sure the sales are goingto
go down," he said. "The custom-
ers will be scared. Nobody wants
to get in trouble. It's a risk."
Similarly, Jet Elia, owner of
Jimmy's Sgt. Pepper's Party
Store on East University Avenue,
said the law will likely "kill"
keg sales because students don't
want to be held responsible for
serving alcohol to minors.
"Do you blame them?" Elia
said. "They don't want any sort
of misdemeanor ontheir record."
LSA senior Greg Juliano said
he thinks some students will be
deterred from purchasing kegs,
particularly students who do so
with fake IDs, since police will
be able to access store records.
He added, however, that stu-
dents who are over 21 will likely
not be discouraged from buying
kegs.
"I don't think it'll kill sales,"
Juliano said.

plan around (satellite disruptions)
and understand which signals are
gettingthrough," she said.
The RAX-2's mission is simi-
lar to its predecessor, the RAX-1,
which ceased activity premature-
ly due to power issues.
Rackham student Sara Spange-
lo, anRAX teammember,wrote in
an e-mail interview that the RAX-
2, funded by the National Science
Foundation, was built quickly as
a result of what the team learned
from the construction of the
RAX-1. Craddock echoed Spange-
lo's sentiment, praising the prog-
ress students made this year. '
"(The RAX-2) is a reflection

of students learning from expe-
rience, and implementing new,
more inventive technologies
firsthand," Craddock wrote in an
e-mail interview.
Students will be monitoring
and "talking" to the satellites
over the course of their missions
to ensure their success, Engi-
neering junior Matt Regan said.
Leading the M-Cubed integra-
tions and testing team, Regan was
responsible for creating testing
procedures for the one kilogram
satellite prior to its launch.
Other RAX and M-Cubed
teams will monitor the satellites'
communication capabilities and
electrical systems while in orbit.
Craddock said though team mem-
bers were excited until the day
of the launch, the next step of

the process - analyzing how the
satellites behave in orbit - is par-
ticularly nerve-racking.
"It's not something we can just
celebrate and kick back about,"
she said.
While Regan and most of the
M-Cubed and RAX-2 team mem-
bers viewed the launch on a live
stream from the Frangois-Xavier
Bagnoud Building on North Cam-
pus, Craddock and a handful of
students traveled to California to
watch the satellites depart aboard
a Boeing Delta II rocket.
"It's really cool to see, because
you know all of your work up to
this point is getting on that rocket
and getting flung out into space,"
Craddock said. "There's a real
passion and dedication in our stu-
dents."

AWARD
From Page 1
Snyder referenced bridges
made with carbon fiber cables -
instead of steel so the bridges are
more durable - as an example of
greeninnovationthat has already
been applied in society.
"After about 10 years, the steel
rusts out, and we need to make
large-scale replacements of bridge
struts and steel to keep them
going," Snyder said. "Ifyoureplace
it with carbon rope, it never rusts.
It's stronger than steel and will
last for many more years."
Simon Ng, associate dean of
research at Wayne State Uni-
versity's College of Engineering,
won the governor's award in the
academic category. Ng created a
catalyst that forms biodiesel fuel
from sources like vegetable oil
and animal fats that could poten-
tially bring down the price of bio-
diesel fuel by as much as $1 per
gallon.
In the category of small busi-
ness, KTM Industries of Lansing,
Mich. was recognized for creat-
ing biodegradable starch foams
for insulation cooler and pack-
aging markets. KTM partnered
with Michigan State University
to create the material, which has
a smaller carbon footprint and
replaces petroleum-based alter-
natives.

Recycled Polymeric Materials
Inc. - a subsidiary of Diversified
Chemical Technologies based in
Detroit - claimed the top award
in the large business category for
commercializing the recycling
of waste rubber into gaskets and
other automotive parts. The gas-
kets are exported to more than 15
countries and are used for more
than 38 vehicle platforms.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman spoke atyesterday's
event and discussed the Univer-
sity's commitment to green tech-
nology in the classroom and the
laboratory. The University offers
more than 640 courses in several
disciplines that focus on sustain-
ability, Coleman said. Addition-
ally, the University no longer uses
mercury, a toxic pollutant, in its
laboratories.
Coleman said she is amazed by
the level of student dedication to
science and sustainability issues.
"It's an enthusiasm that I
haven't seen since my days as a
student during the space race,
and the national drumbeat for
better science," Coleman said.
"But environmental threats far
exceed the challenges of Sputnik
and the space race. They have
serious implications for the entire
planet."
While the winning products
of the governor's award are used
commercially, other innova-
tions presented at the conference

are still in experimental stages.
Showcasing his project to the
crowd, Rackham student Shawn
Eady described his research that
uses enzymes found in anaerobic
bacteria to create more effective
hydrogen gas, with water as the
only byproduct.
"About 9,000 molecules of
hydrogen can be produced per
second, per enzyme molecule ...
which is more than enough than
we'd ever need," Eady said. "That's
about enough to fill up a NASA
fuel engine within like an hour."
Eady predicts that the tech-
nology, which will most likely be
used in fuel cells for transporta-
tion, will be commercially viable
by 2030.
LSA senior Olivia Kramer, part
of a group that works to make
campus laboratories environ-
mentally friendly, presented her
group's efforts to create guide-
lines and evaluations for Univer-
sity teaching and research labs.
The group members, who are in
Environment 391: Sustainabil-
ity and the Campus, drafted a
lab guide for t'esearchers to make
their work more efficient and cre-
ated a checklist for the Office of
Campus Sustainability to certify
green laboratories.
"We conducted a survey to see
what lab users actually thought
would help them create more sus-
tainable lab behaviors," Kramer
said.

Media Day reveals
new-look Big Ten

By MIKE LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
ROSEMONT, Ill. - With the
2011 women's basketball season
just around the corner, the Big
Ten will have a new look.
Defending conference cham-
pion Michigan State is hop-
ing for a repeat performance.
Though the Spartans lost three
starters, including four-year
starter Brittney Thomas, they
return redshirt senior Lykendra
Johnson, the reigning Big Ten
Defensive Player of the Year.
The Michigan women's
basketball team, which lost
Veronica Hicks to graduation, is
looking to secure its first NCAA
Tournament berth under head
coach Kevin Borseth. Now in his
fifth year, Borseth is coaching
solely his recruits, as the cur-
rent seniors comprise his first
recruiting class.
"Last year we won 17 games
and were a little short of get-
ting in the NCAA Tournament,"
Borseth said yesterday at Big
Ten Media Day. "And (that is)
something that our players are
very determined to get back to
this year."
One major change in the Big
Ten came with the addition of
Nebraska. Though the Corn-
huskers went just 13-18 last year
and didn't play in a postseason
tournament, they will be one
more team to add to the mix.
Starting this year, there are
two major rule changes. One
change is the location of the
three-point line - it is now the
same distance as the men's col-
lege three-point line at 20-feet
and 9-inches.
"I don't think it's going to
affect the game that much
because you had two lines out

there (before)," said Michigan
State coach Suzy Merchant.
"And to be honest, our kids
(shot) behind the men's line
more times than we didn't."
Added Borseth: "I guess mov-
ing it back really made it easier
on the floor because those two
lines were pretty confusing from
that perspective."
Another rule change is the
addition of the semi-circle under
the basket, which prevents play-
ers from taking charges under
the rim. This is also a men's rule
that has been adopted for the
women's side.
One reason that the NCAA
committee may have added the
semi-circle was for the players'
protection.
"I guess you don't want kids
to take charges underneath the
basket," Borseth said. "(Basket-
ball) already has the ability to
be (a) pretty volatile game any-
way, with all the collisions. We
certainly don't want to add any
more."
After all the changes that have
occurred, from players graduat-
ing, to the addition of Nebraska
to the couple of rule changes, the
Wolverines will have one more
change to deal with. But this
change should help immensely.
With the renovations to
Crisler Arena this past off-
season, there is a new look to
the stadium. Not only did the
arena receive a total overhaul,
but Michigan also built a new
player development center. The
renovation is not completely fin-
ished, and the players have still
yet to see the center.
"I walked in and it's like you
can't even speak because your
mouth is open," said Borseth.
"You look at it and say, 'Wow,
this is absolutely unbelievable."'

Sophomore guard Tim Hardaway Jr. led Michigan's push in the second half of
conference play last season and will be the leader of the offense this season.

Jr. was often criticized for his
somewhat greedy shot selec-
tion on the perimeter. But his
coach continued to give him the
green light, and his turning point
came at Penn State in February,
when Hardaway Jr. notched 13
of Michigan's final 26 points in a
crucial comeback victory.
The freshman silenced his
critics and went on to average
17.5 points per game in the final
12 contests of the season.
DENY, DENY, DENY: Big Ten
commissioner Jim Delany was
present at Media Day, and he
wound up fielding far more ques-
tions about the possibility of Big
Ten expansion (specifically, the
potential of bringing in Notre
Dame) than about the upcoming
basketball season.

Delany vehemently denied any
notion of expansion, repeatedly
claiming he is very happy with
the conference as it stands.
"There's expansion stories all
over the country, but we're not
part of any of them," Delany said.
"What I think about Louisville
or West Virginia or Notre Dame
or BYU is more as a sports fan
than as a conference commis-
sioner, because our conference is
not involved in these issues."
The commissioner said that
he has not had any recent con-
tact with Notre Dame on the
issue of expansion. When asked
if the conference would be will-
ing to expand within the next
few years, Delany said he would
"never say never," but he couldn't
firmly answer hypotheticals.

Wolverines topple nation' No.
defense in series opener at Yost

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson said that the fourth-
ranked Wolverines had some-
thing to prove in their series
against No. 6 Ferris State. Michi-
gan holds the higher ranking, but
the Bulldogs brought an unde-
feated record with them to Yost
Ice Arena.
And they've beaten some ofthe
nation's top programs in No. 16
Miami and RPI. The Wolverines
failed to establish themselves in
their firsttest of the season at No.
14 Northern Michigan.
Michigan made a statement
on Thursday. Ferris State (2-1
CCHA, 6-1 overall) had sur-
rendered just five goals all year
- less than one per game. The
Wolverines equaled that mark in
the openinggame of the series.
"It's good to score against a
team that doesn't allow goals,"
Berenson said. "We knew goals
would be precious, and maybe
that's why we played a little more
opportunistic."
Michigan (1-1-1, 5-1-1) found
most of its success by moving
the puck down low. It fired nine
shots on goal from the top of
the crease in the second period
despite failing to get a shot from
close range in the first.
The Wolverines capitalized on
those second-period opportuni-'
ties to jump out to a 3-0 lead.
"It's all aboutthe dumps," said
sophomore forward Derek DeB-
lois. "We weren't really skating it
into the zone that well so (it was)
just getting pucks by their 'D'
and working hard. Good things
happen when you go to the net"
Michigan's power play came
alive after sluggish play against
Northern Michigan. The Wol-
verines entered the contest just
5-for-28 withthemanadvantage,
and their failure to convert on a
five-minute penalty in overtime
against the Wildcats forced them
to settle for a two-point shoot-
out victory. The power-play unit
played effectively on Thursday,
converting on two of five chanc-

es. Freshman forward Phil DiGi-
useppe scored Michigan's first
goal of the night on a power-play
chance off a feed from junior for-
ward Chris Brown. Senior for-
ward David Wohlberg converted
for the Wolverines' third goal
when he fired an open wrist shot
in space in front of the crease
with the man advantage.
Michigan, at least temporar-
ily, put to rest any concerns about
the effectiveness of its power
play. The Bulldogs had denied
opponents on 27 of 28 power play
opportunities before Thursday.
"I can't tell you it was any
great execution," Berenson said.
"It was shots finding their way
into the back of the net and sec-
ond efforts on loose pucks and
a little bit of puck luck. But if
you have the puck in their zone
enough, things will happen."
The Wolverines' forwards
harassed Ferris State goalie Tay-
lor Nelson in the later periods.
Screens and traffic in front of
the goal combined with Michi-
gan's improved ability to get the
puck down low created scoring
chances.
"I think just getting the puck
to the net (worked for us)," senior
forward David Wohlberg said.
"The goalie couldn't see much.
(As) Red says, what the goalie
can't see, he can't save."
Berenson still wants to see
more success from the other
end of his special teams. Both
of the Bulldogs' goals came on
the power play. Yet Michigan
made improvements in the areas
it focused on after the Northern
Michigan road trip. The offense
played with more opportun-
ism in its second CCHA series
and proved its power play could
score. The defense, despite strug-
gling with a man down, denied
Ferris State in 5-on-5 play.
"We had to play better than
we played last weekend, and that
might be a common theme all
year," Berenson said.
Brown said that he considered
Michigan the underdog coming
into the series. The Wolverines
didn't play like it.

Junior forward Chris Brown
was adamant this week about
Ferris State's emergence as a
CCHA contender, going as far as
to call the Michigan hockey team
"underdogs" in their two-game
set against
the Bull- FERRIS STATE 2
dogs. MICHIGAN 5
If that
was the angle the fourth-ranked
Wolverines were going for
Thursday night, they didn't play
the part too well.
Michigan doubled the total
number of goals that Ferris State
has allowed this season - from
five to 10 - and turned a tight
first period into an emphatic 5-2
victory. Despite an undefeated
start to the season, the Bulldogs
were handed their first loss.
The game was expected to be
low-scoring since Ferris State
boasted the nation's top defense.
"Their defensemen are like

forwards," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson of the Bulldogunit
that was allowing just .83 goals
per game entering the contest.
"They jump into the play. There's
a lot of activity."
The defensemen's aggres-
siveness is surprising for a unit
so focused on team defense. In
the game's first 20 minutes, the
teams traded blows. Both sides
repeatedly sent pucks down into
the opposition's zone, but no
skaters were there to recover in
scoring position.
That all changed after the first
intermission.From that point on,
the nation's top defense couldn't
prevent Michigan (1-1-1 CCHA,
5-1-1 overall) from collecting the
puck around the net.
There was also fancy pass-
ing, like the kind junior forward
Chris Brown displayed early
in the second period when he
fooled Ferris State netminder
Taylor Nelson.
On the other side of the
pipes, freshman forward PhilÂ°Di

Giuseppe - perhaps the most
pleasant surprise of coach Red
Berenson's latest recruiting class
- was waiting eagerly.
When Nelson committed to
Brown's potential shot, he over-
compensated by sliding and left
Di Giuseppe with more than
half a net to work with. That
was more than enough room for
Michigan to open the night's
scoring with a power-play tally.
Just four minutes later, fresh-
man forward Travis Lynch
scored his fourth goal of the
season. After junior defenseman
Lee Moffie found sophomore
defenseman Mac Bennett, Lynch
skated in to clean up.
And two minutes after Lynch
extended the Wolverine lead,
senior forward David Wohl-
berg's goal made it clear that,
despite sweeping Miami (Ohio)
the previous weekend, No. 6 Fer-
ris State (2-1-0, 6-1-0) needed to
be brought down to earth.
The Bulldogs scored as the
period winded down and added

one more later in the evening
after Michigan sophomore for-
ward Derek DeBlois scored his
first goal of the season.
Up 4-2, with Ferris State's first
loss imminent, Berenson was
satisfied.
But the Wolverines' finest
moment of the evening came
when the result wasn't in any
jeopardy.
Skating against an empty net
late in the third period, Brown
looked up and salivated at the
sight of the open goal.
Then he looked to his left and
saw his linemate Di Giuseppe
matching his stride - the rising
talent who plays wise beyond his
years. For Brown, the decision
was easy. The dish from Brown
to set up Di Giuseppe's second
goal was exactly what Berenson
wanted to see.
"A lot of players have a tough
time doing that, but good for
(Brown)," Berenson said. "It
shows you what kind of a team
we are."

Win over No. 20
Illinois would give
Michigan a Big Ten
Tourney berth
By SAMANTHA PEARSON
Daily Sports Writer
A lot is at stake for the Michi-
gan women's soccer team this
Saturday.
The result of the Wolverines'
game against No. 20 Illinois in
Champaign will be a huge deter-
minant in whether Michigan
will advance into the Big Ten
Tournament starting Nov. 2 in
Evanston.
"It's been a weird Big Ten sea-
son," said senior captain Court-
ney Mercier. "There are six
teams currently all within one
point of each other.
"The only control we have on
the selection is by assuring a vic-
tory against Illinois this week-
end."
The six teams that will be
vying for a spot in the Big Ten
Tournament include Michigan,
Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio State,
Nebraska, and Purdue.

Here we go again. Another loss to the Spartans, another second
half full of questions. Let's be honest, Michigan State was the
best team the Wolverines played. Michigan hasn't shown much
so far this season, and with Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio State loom-
ing, wins are becoming more precious than ever. At the begin-
ning of the year this week looked like a win. After Purdue lost to
Rice in Week 2, it was a guarantee. Now, the Boilermakers are
coming off an upset of Illinois and appear to have settled on a
quarterback. Now is the time to start holding your breath.

Western Michigan (Sept. 3): Good thing the
rain came. And the blitzes, too. Looked like Greg
Robinson was coaching until the second quarter.
Notre Dame (Sept. 10): Nothing to see here.
Michigan rallied with a 28-point fourth quarter
to stun the Fighting Irish and get the victory.
Eastern Michigan (Sept. 17): After struggling
early, Michigan relied on the legs of Denard
Robinson and Vincent Smith for the 31-3 win.
San Diego State (Sept. 24): Denard Robinson's
200 yards rushing outshone his lousy day pass-
ing, while Michigan bullied the Aztecs up front.
Minnesota (Oct. 1): The Gophers and the 58-0
score were a pleasant distraction from the real-
ity of Big Ten play.
Northwestern (Oct. 8): Dan Persa almost got it
done. Then Michigan put him on his back for the
entire second half and came away with a victory.

Michigan State (Oct. 15): It wasn't as bad as
the previous three years, but in a way that made
it worse. Seniors, you're leaving having never
beaten the Spartans.
Purdue (Oct. 29): Guard your ACLs! The knee
injury has plagued Purdue the past two seasons.
Quarterback Rob Henry was the latest victim.
Iowa (Nov. 5): The faces change, but it always
seems like Kirk Ferentz finds the same types of
players. This is just another solid Iowa team.
Illinois (Nov. 12): Nathan Scheelhaase-to-A.J.
Jenkins and Jason Ford is the whole offense.
Consider Scheelhaase a poor man's Denard.
Nebraska (Nov. 19): The legendary blackshirts
make their debut at the Big House. By the time
Jared Crick and Co. leave, it may get ugly for 'M.'
Ohio State (Nov. 26): No Tressell? No Pryor?
Ohio State's still deeper than Michigan, but a lot
could change by Thanksgiving.

IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR SOUL

weight room and bolted up a flight of stairs to find Dave.
"Hey, Dave, you got an offer," Tom said, pausing to catch
his breath.
Tom had just hung up after a phone call from a North-
western coach in Evanston. Northwestern - just 40 miles
away from Lemont - had extended to Dave his first offer to
play college football.
Dave turned to his father. He knew he wasn't done play-
ing football.
"Don't worry, Dad, there will be more," Dave said.
It was the first breakthrough in a long, rollercoaster
recruiting journey for Dave. Until that point, he and the
coaches had been forced to plead with schools to take a look
at his tape.
But the tape was pretty convincing.
"I can still remember when Dave and Coach Coneset
were putting together highlight film," Lemont head coach
Eric Michaelson said. "Itwas like the Ten Commandments,
it was taking so much time.
"Finally (Coneset) said, 'Hey, come here.' Whoa. I'd be
following the play and then all of the sudden you see Dave
just beatin' the dogstuffing out of a kid."
Before Northwestern offered, Dave didn't start to get-
ting any attention from college programs until he accept-
ed an invitation to a recruiting combine in Iowa City. His
Scout.com recruiting profile listed size as his only disad-
vantage.
"That was the only thing anyone ever said to me," Dave
said.
"Dave doesn't have a problem with his size," Tom added.
"It's just the media that has a problem with his size. Every-
one else has a size problem."
At 6-foot-2, 265 pounds, few expected Dave
to survive at an elite college program. But the
same recruiting profile also listed Dave's "nasty
streak" asa positive.
In Iowa City, the size issue took a backseat
while the nasty streak did the talking. And one
defensive tackle in particular paid the price in
one-on-one drills.
"This kid, he was just running a train on
everyone that was at that combine," Dave said.
So instead of following the regular rotation,
Dave stepped out and picked his opponent -
the biggest, strongest lineman there.
"Hey, give me the kid with the dreads," Dave "'o
said.
Man to man: you versus me. Dave plowed
right through him.
"The next time he came up, he was obviously
pissed that I beat him," Dave said. "He goes,
'Hey, I want the boy with the fade.' And I beat
him again."
Size really didn't matter. Dave could play.
As Dave expected, the offers started rolling in
from across the country.
The father-son duo traveled to 19 universi-
ties during the recruiting process. Make no
mistake, this much attention on a football play-
er was unusual for a middling football town like
Lemont.
Interestingly enough, Dave was looking for
a strength and conditioning coach more than
anything. He found one he liked in Mike Bar-
wis at West Virginia.
"His sales pitch is the best in the country,
and I heard them all," Dave said. "One of the
things that he did in the recruiting visit was he
ran up to this big yoga ball and jumps on it. He
just stood there and talked to me and my dad Dave Mol
for 10 minutes, standing on the ball.

"I saw what he did and figured, if he does what he does,
he can make me do what he does."
But West Virginia was dealt one swift stroke of bad for-
tune. While the Molks were in the car en route to Morgan-
town, W. Va., Dave got a call from Michigan - his final
offer.
Ann Arbor became the last of 19 stops on the recruiting
trail. Michigan fifth-year senior defensive end Ryan Van
Bergen - Molk's roommate - still teases Molk about his
visit.
"Dave Molk is the one guy in the history of all official
visits to request to go to the weight room on his visit to lift,"
Van Bergen said, laughing. "How meat-headed is that?"
The moment he got back into the car to head home, Dave
told his father he was going to become a Wolverine, select-
ing Michigan over front-runners Wisconsin and Iowa.
Tom felt the fit, too. It just took one step onto the Michi-
gan Stadium turf. He admits that he shed a few tears that
day at Michigan.
Dave remembers his father saying, "If Gail would have
seen you walk into that empty stadium at Michigan ..."
In seventh grade, when Dave Molk glanced over his
shoulder in the opening strains of The Star-Spangled Ban-
ner, he saw something he never wanted to forget.
He saw his mother and father settling into lawn chairs
on the hill. She was bracing herself against the cold wind.
Her hair was gone. What he saw was just fine. It was Mom.
He relives that memory, that scene, every football Sat-
urday.

"It's kind of something I've never told anyone before,"
Dave said, stopping to clear his throat.
"But at a certain point in the national anthem, I turned
around, looked up and saw her. And at that same point
every game I've ever played, I look up into the flag and say,
'I love you, Mom.
"And every time I start to tear up and then I get really
pissed off. That's part of the reason I head-butt Jack so
hard."
The toughest center in the nation promised to never
use his mother's death as a crutch. But he's taken her with
him from the Lemont High School football field to the Big
House and every stadium in between.
He won't let himself forget her. She was the side of Dave
Molk that rarely shows itself, the side that almost nobody
knows.
"I got my heart from her, no doubt about it," Dave said.
It's been nearly 10 years since Dave's mother passed
away. Dave hasn't scored another touchdown - he doesn't
want to. His one and only touchdown was for her.
The ball he gave her still sits on display in the Molk
home.
"It's always hard, for any kid doing anything - it doesn't
have to be football," Dave said. "She didn't see me graduate
high school. She didn't see me come to Michigan. She's not
going to see me graduate college. She's not going to see me
play in college.
"There's a lot of stuff that she's not going to see. But I
know in some way, shape or form, she saw them."
His mother has been gone for a decade of his life, but
Dave knows she hasn't missed a snap.

Perimeter defense key to stopping Boilermakers

Everyone in Lemont remembers exactly when Dave
Molk, now the starting center on the Michigan football
team, exploded onto the football scene. It wasn't a snap, a
pancake block or a pregame speech. It was an offseason -
during the winter and spring, when the field outside Lemont
High School was iced over and nothing but the weight room
was open.
Dave entered high school at 5-foot-6 and 180 pounds - "a
pudgy little freshman kid," according to Lemont strength
coach John Coneset.
After noticing him on the freshman team, Coneset took
Dave under his wing and brought him into Coneset's world
- the weight room.
Dave was hooked.
The following season, Dave started on the Lemont Indi-
ans varsity team's offensive line as a sophomore.
From Lemont to Michigan, his size was questioned every
step of the way. He was too small. That's why Dave loved
the weight room. It's a direct comparison that never lies: you
versus me. Dave never lost the battle.
Within two years, he added 100 pounds and was out-
lifting Coneset. Dave also grew seven inches, which helped.
"Saying Dave liked the weight room would be anunder-
statement," Coneset said, glancing around at the rows of
equipment. "He loved this place. He was always the last one
out of here."
Dave was always the last one out of the weight room, but
that didn't mean he had reached the end of his workout.
Coneset and the other members of the Lemont coaching
staff alternated staying past 5 P.M. to lock up the weight
room after Dave finished his workout. They would go home
for dinner. Dave wouldn't.
"I'd work out at the high school gym for two-and-a-half
hours," Dave said. "When Coneset would finally say, 'Dave,
I'm getting outta here, you've got to leave,' I got in my car
and went to Powerhouse Gym for another hour and a half."
Thinking back, Dave's old teammates laugh - he never
had any company at Powerhouse.
4 "No, absolutely not," former Lemont tight end Sean
Brickey said. "Dave was a madman."
Even his best friends didn't understand it. Why would the
undersized lineman spend all his time in the weight room,

where no one even noticed?
The answer isn't so difficult for
Dave. It's in his blood.
He comes from a family of the big-
gest, strongest men you can find. His
father is 6-foot-5. Steve is 6-foot-4.
The other half of the equation came
from his mother.
"She's the toughest person I've ever
met," Dave said. "She might be a rea-
son I have never let an injury get to me,
because she never showed her pain.
She dealt with unimaginable pain, so
nothing I could have would compare."
Dave didn't use the game of football
to cope with his mother's death, but
rather to remember her life.
"She showed me just how precious
life is," Dave said. "I realized that I
wanted to do everything I could do to=
get the most out of mine.
"I wanted to make the most of whatx
I have because I knew, saw and experi-
enced how short it can be."
Today, a photo of Dave sits propped
against the window facing outof Cone-
set's office, overlooking the weight
room. The overlayingtext on the photo
reads, "Offensive Player of the Game:
David Molk - Eastern Michigan."
Coneset asked Dave for a copy of the r
photo after Michigan's win over the,
Eagles in 2009. Dave had it delivered
to the weight room. Michigan's All- Fifth-year senior c
America candidate will send another
photo when he reaches the NFL.
That Lemont High School weight room is where Dave
Molk was born asa football player.
"Fastest and strongest - that's why I love the weight
room," Dave said. "That's where I make my money. That's
where my football career lives: strength and speed. I knew
that my size wouldn't matter if I got to the defender before
he got to me."
Dave Molk has always had a mean streak.
He and his brother will stand up to anybody and stare
them down. It's seen both on the football field and at home.
Tom gave his sons boxing gloves at the ages of six and
seven. But Tom readily admits that losing their mother like-
ly played a part in the boys' aggression.
"Steve expelled his anger in a place that was considered
unauthorized," Tom said. "Dave had another place to expel
his anger, and that was on the football field."
Seated on a workout bench in the Lemont weight room,
Tom pauses, shifts his gaze and laughs.
"When he put the helmet on, it flips a switch for him and
he becomes somebody that nobody can like," he continued.
That switch was first flipped in elementary school, when
Dave started playing football. He was too delicate. He was
getting picked on by the team bully.
"Dave, you have to stop being nice," Tom told him at the
time. "When you put that helmet on, you're a gladiator. Play
like it."
Dave did just that. The next time the bully spit in his face-
mask, Dave took him down, faster than any pancake block
he's ever thrown.
Everyone learned a lesson that day. The bully never
came back to Dave. Tom realized his son's raw power. Dave
learned that he loved to hit.

Edwin Baker to the perim- larly, as Hoke said, the linebackers
here he found plenty of run- need to read the play quicker and

react faster.
Mattison and Hoke used the
bye week to fix these problems,
because Hoke expects Michigan's
perimeter to be attacked again this
week against Purdue.
The same stretch play that
Michigan State ran with Baker and
similar bubble and quick-hitting
screen passes that both teams ran
could come back to haunt the Wol-
verines, Hoke said, because Purdue
runs the same plays.
"I think their backs are fast,"
Mattison said, referring to junior
running backs Ralph Bolden and
Akeem Shavers. "They seem very,
very quick. They have a lot of ways
that they try to get to the perimeter
with the ball."
Added Martin: "They do a good.
job of getting the ball in a lot of
guys hands. ... They have a lot of
weapons. We've just got to make
sure we execute on defense and we
run to the ball and get guys down."
The problems that have plagued
the whole defense - a lack of
aggressiveness getting off blocks,
everyone running to the ball,
missed tackles - are worrisome
because they are all fundamental
basics of Mattison's defense and

trademarks of the unit during the
Wolverines' first five games.
In practice this week, the defen-
sive players worked on wrapping
up, running through offensive
players and finishing tackles. If
they did it wrong, the coaches
ripped them and forced them to
stay after practice to hit the sleds.
Running to the ball is a combi-
nation of aggressiveness to get off
the initial block and awareness to
contain, meaning that Michigan
instructs every player to funnel the
ball back to the middle of the field
to another defender.
"We've seen what's happened on
film," said fifth-year senior defen-
sive tackle Will Heininger. "We
just have to turn the ball in. Every
coordinator I've ever had in high
school, it was, 'Turn the ball inside
to your guys, and then have every-
one pursue.
"And we're not good enough -
we don't have all 11 NFL players
where everyone can make the play
- we've got to get everybody to the
ball and everyone do their assign-
ment. (Then) it doesn't matter if
they run inside or outside."
Purdue junior quarterback
Caleb TerBush has been the facili-

tator of the equal-opportunity
Boilermaker offense, which fea-
tures two 300-yard rushers and
three 200-yard receivers. During
the bye week, many Michigan play-
ers watched TerBush play one of
his best games of the season, as he
completed 64 percent of his passes
and spread the ball to eight dif-
ferent receivers. Purdue upset No.
23 Illinois, thanks in large part to
TerBush.
But Michigan practiced all
week with the mindset of fixing its
defensive problems.
"This game is about Michigan,"
Martin said. "Coach has really
been talking about that. Because it
doesn't really matter what Purdue
does.... It boils down to what we do
and how we execute."
Hoke said his team practiced
faster and more downhill this
week, as the defense returned to its
fundamentals.
"If you're hesitant at all, that
half a step that you're behind can
cost you as a defense," Hoke said.
"I think we played a little bit ten-
tative, and you can't play tentative.
If you're going to make mistakes,
make them aggressive. I can han-
dle that."

enter Dave Molk picked Michigan over Wisconsin and lowa.
That passion is what has kept him in the game of football
from the youth leagues to Michigan and beyond. His Lem-
ont teammates joke that, if it weren't for the sideways smile
he cracks after every big hit, sometimes no one can tell if
Dave enjoys the game of football.
"Dave was never aggressive off the football field," said
former Lemont cornerback Ryan Buttney. "But he's on a
mission on the field."
Dave is always searching for a chance to showcase his
strength. He loves nothing more than hearing that he's fac-
ing a nose guard on Saturday touted as one of the best in the
nation.
"He loves that, because he just wants to smatter him,"
Tom said. "He wanted to knock him on his ass, 'Welcome to
college football."'
Before every game at Michigan, Dave welcomes one of
his teammates to college football by head-butting another
offensive lineman - hard. He claims he gave redshirt junior
lineman Ricky Barnum a concussion last season.
True freshman lineman Jack Miller has been the victim
this season.
"I like Jack," Dave said. "He doesn't like it. He always says
it's OK if he knows it's coming. Usually, when I come back
from the coin toss, I'll just kind of run up to him and grab
him, and slam my head into him."
That tenacity, before games and at the line of scrimmage,
is why Dave was already on his third helmet of the season by
the Big Ten opener.
"Dave told me he compresses his facemask so much that
it pulls out of the sides and cracks the back of his helmet,"
former Lemont offensive lineman Nick Palermo said. "I just
looked at him. 'You just told me you crack helmets.'''
Tom Molk flung the door open, entered the Lemont

Gail Molk looked back, watching her 12-year-old
son prepare to play the final game of his seventh-
grade season in the Lemont youth football league.
It was the last game Gail.would see.
After battling breast cancer for 12 years, the can-
cer had spread to her brain in the fourth relapse.
Years of off-and-on chemotherapy had sapped her
strength and left her bald. She wasn't wearing a wig
that November day at the football field.
"The whole game, all I could do was turn around
and look at my mom," Dave said 10 years later, blink-
ing back tears. "It was so scary. The cancer was fully
in effect. That was right near the end of the season,
when it was the worst."
Late in the game, Dave's team rumbled down to
the five-yard line.
"Molk," coach Jeff Christiansen barked. "You're
in at tailback. Go ahead and score."
For the two-way lineman, this was a first. He
lined up four yards behind the quarterback and took
the first-down handoff - stuffed. Second down -
stuffed.

By Stephen J. Nesbitt 7/ Daily Sports Editor
With the early strains
of The Star-Spangled Banner hanging in
the brisk autumn air, Dave Molk glanced
over his shoulder. His mother and father
were settling into lawn chairs on the
grassy hill next to the Lemont High
School football field.

On third down, Dave knocked straight through
the line and fell into the endzone.
Without a second thought, he picked himself up
and kept running. He ran through the gate at the
back of the endzone, around the cement sidewalk
and all the way up the hill. Glassy-eyed, he handed
the football to his mother.
"This is for you, Mom."
Gail never let that football go.
A month later, Dave and his older brother Steve
gathered around their mother in the family room as
her life left her.
Tom Molk, their father, sat alongside his wife.
As a family, they didn't want Gail to pass away in
the hospital. They'd conceded that the cancer had
finally won, but they wouldn't let it dictate how she
would leave them.
On December 12, 2001- three days before Dave's
13th birthday - Gail passed away in the Molk fam-
ily room, surrounded by her boys and husband.
