New ed.

doubts
0 Officials, experts
worry federal gov't
could overstep role
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Editor in Chief
Though President Barack Obama's
remarks Friday morning were met
with unbridled enthusiasm from a
majority of the 4,000 people who
packed Al Glick Field House to see
him, the higher education policies he
unveiled in the speech faced scrutiny
and trepidation from higher educa-
tion leaders and experts.
During his address, the president
unveiled a handful of policies aimed
at making college more affordable.
These projects include an expan-
sion of federal aid to universities that
would be tied to tuition costs, a Race
to the Top competition for states
to earn federal dollars and a higher
education report card that would
require universities to release more
information about their financial aid
offerings.
Several public university presi-
dents across the country, includ-
ing University President Mary Sue
Coleman, expressed concern that
the Obama administration was
tying federal aid to tuition levels as
states continue to cut higher educa-
tion appropriations, creating budget
shortfalls for many public institu-
tions.
After Obama's speech, Coleman
said she supported the president's

Outside event,

several issues
By HALEY GOLDBERG and
AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily News Editor and For the Daily
Despite the 20 degree weather,
members of the University com-
munity, Ann Arbor and Michigan
residents joined the capacity crowd
of 4,000 people that slowly passed
through security and filed into
Al Glick Field House early Friday
morning to hear President Barack
Obama present his plan for financial
aid reform.
Attendees expressed a variety
of perceptions about his address
and the president's overall perfor-
mance as a leader thus far, some
demonstrating strong support, oth-
ers expressing feelings of disillu-
sion. In addition to the students who
waited eagerly outside, clutching
tickets they had waited all-night to
receive, a group of protesters also
formed outside the event, dispelling
the president's stance on issues from
abortion to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
Before the speech, LSA senior Jon
Hornstein said he looked forward
to hearing Obama's plans for high-
er education, particularly since he
intends to work in higher education
consulting after graduation. After
the speech, Hornstein said he felt
Obama's address was well delivered.

4,000 pack Al
Glick Field House
on Friday
By BETHANY BIRON and
JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Managing News Editor and
Editor in Chief
Speaking before a bleary-
eyed capacity crowd of 4,000
who waited in the wee hours
of the morning Friday to
secure a prime spot, President
Barack Obama stressed the
importance of higher educa-

tion by announcing a handful
of new proposals to combat
student debt.
During his address at Al
Glick Field House, the Michi-
gan football team's indoor
practice facility, Obama
unveiled a plan that would
allocate $10 billion in federal
aid each year to colleges and
universities that limit tuition
increases. Ann Arbor was
Obama's last stop on a three-
day, five-state, trip following
his State of the Union address
on Tuesday.
"We are putting colleges on
notice - you can't keep - you

can't assume that you'll just
jack up tuition every single
year," Obama said. "If you
can't stop tuition from going
up, then the funding you get
from taxpayers each year will
go down."
Obama also proposed a
$1 billion Race to the Top
program that would award
funding to states that make
an effort to continue to fund
higher education and limit
tuition hikes.
"We're telling the states,
if you can find new ways to
bring down the cost of col-
lege and make it easier for

we'll help you do it," Obama
said. "We will give you addi-
tional federal support if you
are doing a good job of mak-
ing sure that all of you aren't
loaded up with debt when you
graduate from college."
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Secretary of
Education Arne Duncan said
the administration is working
to make more resources avail-
able to students. The presi-

Newly-opened
hospital to be
certified
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
High ceilings, natural light-
ing and cork flooring may appear
to simply be the trappings of the
posh Ross School of Business.
However, those pleasing aesthet-
ics serve a different purpose - to
uphold the University's commit-
ment to sustainable building
practices.
Despite formalizing its com-
mitment to Leadership in Ener-
gy and Environmental Design
only a year ago, the University is
home to several LEED certified
buildings that are adhering to
more environmentally sustain-
able practices. The Ross School
of Business, the Samuel T. Dana
Building and the newly-opened
C.S. Mott Children's and Von
Voigtlander Women's Hospital
are among the first LEED certi-
fied buildings on campus.
The U.S. Green Building Coun-

cil oversees the LEED program,
with guidelines that provide a
framework for a host of building
types and projectsi LEED certi-
fication requires the use of recy-
clable and sustainable materials
in the building process, water
and energy conservation, avoid-
ing harsh or poisonous chemicals
in the construction and main-
tenance of the building, and the
creation of a positive atmosphere
for those who will occupy the
building.
Terry Alexander, executive
director of the Office of Cam-
pus Sustainability, said the first
building on campus to achieve
LEED certification was the Dana
building, fittingly the home of
the School of Natural Resources
and Environment, but the Uni-
versity formally adopted LEED
last January as a standard for
all new large-scale construction
projects.
"That was an actual formal
decision by the Environmental
Sustainability Executive Coun-
cil that (University) President
(Mary Sue) Coleman chairs to
adopt LEED as a design policy
for the campus," Alexander said.

CONTINUING SERIES
SUSTAINABILITY
ON CAMPUS
"At this time it's all new non-
clinical, non-medical buildings
over $10 million (must be LEED
certified)."
Along with implementing
LEED standards, USGBC also
evaluates buildings after their
construction to ensure obser-
vance of the guidelines.
According to Jaime Van
Mourik, director of higher edu-
cation for USGBC, LEED stan-
dards strive not only for energy
efficiency, but also for the use
of sustainable materials. Van
Mourik said that while the first
sustainability push in the 1970s
focused almost solely on energy
conservation, the focus was too
narrow, which led to the creation
of the LEED standards in 2000.
"At this time, higher education
is actually the leading market
sector of all the different mar-
ket sectors ..." Van Mourik said.
"There are over 4,700 LEED

"If your laptop is recovered,

CSG President DeAndree

dance at the event, praised the
work of DPS on campus and
their initiatives to make law
enforcement more transparent
to students and staff.
"I'm really excited that they
are eager to engage the stu-
dent body in the process, that
they're actively listening to the
concerns that are coming from
our student safety commission
and that they look forward to
working with them to imple-
ment some of the strategies in
the best possible manner," Wat-

After the meeting, Piersante
said DPS is working to under-

date more students would be
able to attend meetings.
"What I would like to do is
reach out with different stu-
dents and the dean of students
to find out what is a good time
for students to get to these
things," Piersante said. "Yes, I
would like to see more student

Crime meetings were a
product of former DPS Chief
Greg O'Dell, who committed
suicide last month. Piersante
said O'Dell would have wanted
the meetings to continue.
"I knew Greg fairly well for
about 15 years going back to
when he was a deputy chief
in Ann Arbor and when I was
a deputy chief here, and we
worked together," Piersante
said. "I have a lot of respect
for him, and I want to continue
this program in the future."

registered and certified (higher-
education related) projects in the
nation. You could think of one
project per campus."
The USGBC's ultimate goal is
to convert all existing buildings
and implement LEED standards
for new construction to create a
sustainable building model for
the nation.
"We say that within a gen-
eration everybody will be living,
working, playing, doing anything
and everything in a green build-
ing," Van Mourik said.
Van Mourik added that the
costs and difficulty of work-
ing with LEED standards has
decreased dramatically over the
years, as the market has adopted
the standards and manufactur-
ers have begun producing special
LEED products.
"When the LEED building
system launched in 2000, the
concept of green building was
still very new." Van Mourik said.
"We've seen quite the transfor-
mation in the way the industry is
working, professionals are being
trained and what manufacturers
are doing. To date, we have over
175,000 LEED accredited profes-
sionals across the globe."
Alexander added that adopt-
ing LEED practices costs about
4 percent more in building costs
than using non-LEED materi-
als and standards. Several other
buildings on campuswould prob-
ably qualify for LEED certifica-
tion, but the University has not
formally pursued the certifica-
tion process, he said.
"Not everything you do for
LEED has an actual payback to
it." Alexander said. "There are
things that LEED requires you
do that does have a payback, such
as water conservation and energy
conservation."
Alexander said that at the time
of the Council's decision to adopt
LEED standards, the clinical
buildings were exempt because
the USGBC had not yet finalized
the guidelines for medical facili-
ties. However, Alexander saidthe
USGBC has since published these
standards, and he expects the
Council to vote on adopting them
in the next few months.
Both Alexander and Van
Mourik said that LEED certi-
fication for medical centers is
especially challenging due to the
energy-intensive nature of medi-
cal technology. However, theC.S.
Mott Children's and Von Voigt-
lander Women's Hospital which
opened last December expects to
be LEED certified and has sev-
eral innovative features to help
it achieve qualification. The deci-
sion on its certification isnexpect-
ed next month.
Loree Collett, administrative
director of Children's and Wom-
en's Services at the University
of Michigan Health System, said
the University began the build-
ing process fully committed to
achieving LEED certification as a
priority - the question was more
a matter of degree. Collett cited
the non-wax rubber flooring and
the "green roof" as some of the
main elements of the building's
bid for LEED certification.
"Our roof has somewhere
between 16 and 24 inches of dirt,
of barriers, gravel, plants, differ-

ent things in order to make this
(a) green roof. So, we have right
around 70,000 little seedlings
growing up on our roof." Collett
job creation."
DesJardins added that his class
questioned how Obama has heav-
ily credited a college education to
improving the economy. While
DesJardins said a college educa-
tion undoubtedly allows people to
get better-paying jobs, he added
there's value in a liberal arts edu-
cation in and of itself.
"They were worried about how
tightly he had linked the idea of
education, and some instrumen-
tal goal, the instrumental goal
being, get a job," DesJardins said.
DesJardins said the students
were also disappointed that
Obama's speech focused on sev-
eral other issues - like manufac-
turing, job creation and the auto
industry - aside from higher edu-
cation.
"The first thing to come out
of their mouth was, 'Great cam-
paign speech,"' DesJardins said.
"It seemed like the first order
was, this seems like a campaign
speech, and then the second or

said. "It's literally like havingdirt
and plants on top of the roof, and
what it does for us is it extends
the life of the roof of the building
about twice as long as a tradition-
al roof. It also helps reduce the
heating and the cooling costs."
Collett added that part of the
LEED certification is creating a
positive environment for those
working in the building. She said
she feels working in the build-
ing is easier and more enjoyable
because it has windows on all
floors and advanced HEPA air fil-
tration - a medical grade system
for infection control.
Rackham student Graham
Brown, team coordinator and
former board member for Stu-
dent Sustainability Initiative,
said the group has worked with
the University in advocating for
the construction of LEED build-
ings.
"I am very enthusiastic about
the progress that the Univer-
sity has made over the last few
years moving toward sustain-
ability." Brown said. "I think
that it is important to recognize
that three years ago, there was
no office on campus of sustain-
ability, there was no central coor-
dinated effort. What happened
on campus with regards to sus-
tainability and operations was
very 'ad hoc' and sort of disorga-
nized."
Graham said he was pleased
with the progress the University
has made toward sustainability,
but hopes to see the implementa-
tion of the most rigorous LEED
Gold or Platinum standards in
the future.
University alum Brian Swett,
who received a dual Master's
degree inthe Ross SchoolofBusi-
ness and the School of Natural
Resources and the Environment,
now oversees LEED projects for
Boston Properties, a real estate
firm in Massachusetts. During
his time at the University, Swett
said he was part of an advisory
panel for the construction of the
new Ross School of Business and
lobbied for the use of local and
sustainable materials, in addition
to energy efficiency.
"I think the University did a
much faster job of building this
into theireducationthanthey did
in building it into their building
standards," Swett said, referenc-
ing the beginning of the Univer-
sity's sustainability initiative in
2008.
Swett said having a Master's
of science and Master of Busi-
ness Administration, as well as
his hands-on expertise in LEED,
made him a much more competi-
tive candidate in the job market.
He added he was able to market
himself to companies as someone
with a new, valuable skill set for
the future.
"One of the things that sets
the University graduates apart
is their ability to take classes
in other schools and get dual
degrees," Swett said. "Those
integrated skill sets, you don't
get within one master's program.
Michigan does a phenomenal job
of allowing students to bridge
(many disciplines) and get a dual
education."
Swett said the availability of
LEED products and profession-
als has undergone a "night and
day" transformation from where
it was ten years ago, making

building a LEED certified struc-
ture much more economical.

third order was that there is this
education policy written into this
too."
Obama's visit to the University
reaffirmed Michigan's status as a
swing state in November's elec-
tion. According to a Detroit Free
Press/WXYZ-TV poll taken last
week, Obama led former Massa-
chusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by 48
percent to 40 percent in a poll of
600 voters. Romney led the presi-
dent 46 percent to 41 percent in
the same poll taken in November.
The Obama campaign itself has
also acknowledged Michigan's
importance in the 2012 race. In a
video posted on its campaign site,
Jim Messina, Obama's campaign
manager, showed six different
combinations of states Obama
could win to reclaim the presi-
dency. In each scenario, Michigan
was included as a state Obama
needed to win.

French authorities have filed

vision, but added that it would
be impossible to achieve with-
out additional state funding. The
state government cut funding to
Michigan's 15 public universi-
ties by 15 percent last year under
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder.
"What isn't sustainable is hav-
ing the state every year cut, cut,
cut, cut," Coleman said. "Then
you can't make it up, without low-
ering quality."
The tuition-based plan Obama
introduced on Friday would
increase the amount of directly
administered federal aid offered
to $10 billion - up from its cur-
rent $3 billion. In total though,
the amount of federal aid affected
by Obama's new proposals is min-
imal since a majority of the $140
billion in federal financial aid is
administered as grants or loans
that are already given directly to

students.
Stephen DesJardins, director
of the University's Center for the
Study of Higher and Postsecond-
ary Education, teaches a gradu-
ate course in higher education
policy and watched and analyzed
Obama's speech with his students
in class on Friday.
DesJardins said it could be dif-
ficult for the administration to
implement such wide reaching
policies because, in reality, the
higher education industry is quite
nuanced. He added that the fed-
eral government has little control
over institutions of higher educa-
tion.
"The federal government's
lever, their policy lever, is the
power of the purse," DesJardins
said. "They really have very little
leverage other than that on insti-
tutions, especi:rtn in a state like
Michigan, wvhere institutions
have constitutional autonomy.

A greener future
States should regulate marijuana like alcohol
olorado may become the new battleground for marijuana
legalization. A proposal likely to be on the ballot this Novem-
ber asks the state government to regulate cannabis like alcohol.
Colorado joins Washington and Missouri, who will soon have similar
ballot propositions, while a smaller push occurs in Michigan. Numer-
ous pro-legalization groups have pushed the initiative in Colorado to
try to make the illicit drug safer and to combat the problems that have
come with medical marijuana legalization. All states, fromtolorado to
Michigan, should explore legalization initiatives and begin regulating
marijuana in a safer and more realistic manner.

T he political reality of a rally

W hen I saw President
Obama stride onstage,
my thoughts tuned
to "The West
Wing." There
simply will never
be a television
series that can
surpass itssuperb
cast, writing, and
direction. If you
disagree with ANDREW
me, I'll happily WEINER
punch you in the
throat.
When creator
and writer Aaron Sorkin left after
season four, however, the political
drama - following two terms of a
fictional White House - suffered.
Seasons five and six came and went,
but the show found its spark again
in season seven, focusingon a presi-
dential election.
The result was exhilarating to
watch - a Hispanic Democrat tak-
ing on a moderate Republican. Like
much of the show, you take its rep-
resentation of presidential politics
with a grain of salt as opposed to
a true depiction. Still, watching a
behind-the-scenes depiction of a
presidential campaign is fascinat-
ing. The back room dealings, secrets
and lies, personal relationships and
problems scattered along the way
make for a great plot. The part I
couldn't get over, however, was how
those problems disappeared when a
candidate got onstage to address a
crowd.
Seeing what occurred immediate-
ly before and after rallies and speech-
es makes you realize how much of a
production these events are. Bright
lights, camera crews and makeup
teams - are we on Capitol Hill or the
back lot of Universal Studios?
When I was in Iowa for the
Republican caucuses early this
month, I could've sworn I'd stum-
bled onto the set of "The West
Wing." The night before the Tues-
day caucus, candidate Mitt Romney
hosted a rally at a large manufac-
turing warehouse about 15 minutes
outside of Des Moines. I immedi-
ately wondered how much thought
went into pickingthat specific loca-
tion. A safe estimate is "a lot."

Immediately upon entering the
building, attendees were immedi-
ately blinded by bright floodlights,
which illuminated a small raised
stage already surrounded by hun-
dreds of supporters. To play up
the scene to the cameras, those
who came were packed into a tiny
section of the facility - it could
have held hundreds more far more
comfortably. But, hey, it's all about
appearances.
I went into every event in Iowa
with a moderately negative atti-
tude, but the rally won the top
prize. Being smashed against
people in support of Romney, or
any of the Republican candidates,
is hardly on my daily to-do list. A
teenaged girl with dyed purple hair
pushed next to me, attempting to
make small talk. "You know what
I'm worried about?" What are you
worried about, crazy girl? Besides
matching your flannel pants to your
hair color, of course. "Occupiers."
I struggled to stifle a laugh.
"Why?"
"I don't know," she mumbled,
"something about them's just not
right."
I kept staring at one blinding
light hanging from the high ceil-
ing that would shine down on the
former governor of Massachusetts
when he finally emerged. Every
part of this was so horrifyingly cal-
culated. I looked around for a grain
of truth, but the light kept remind-
ing me I was on a television set, not
observing the political process.
Mitt Romney came out and I
mused on who had picked out his
wife's necklace, how his sons had
been instructed to stand, why his
speech said absolutely nothing of
substance but was still interrupted
by cheers and, most importantly,
how good they looked doing it.
Romney's team designed the set;
all the news channels had to bring
were the cameras.
On Friday, like thousands of other
students, I came to see President
Barack Obama speak at Al Glick
Field House. Fortunately, I was out-
side the fences caging the packed
audience. They only used a small
portion of the football field, but I
was too excited to see the president

to put much thought into that.
I'll admit it. I was wholeheart-
edly seduced by the entire event.
Students camping in the cold for
tickets, my White House Press Pool
pass, Obama calling out Denard -
how crazy cool was this! When the
speech started, I listened atten-
tively and agreed with most of what
he proposed - smiling like a crazy
person the whole time.
At a certain point, I realized
Obama's sleeves were rolled up.
Those cuffs were too perfect,
there's no way he rolled them him-
self. The illusion was shattered and
I emerged from fantasyland.
Is this
Capitol Hill or
Hollywood?
A light hanging from the ceil-
ing shined on Obama just like it
had shone on Romney a month
ago. American flags and Block 'M's
were strategically placed around
Glick. His speech pandered to his
audience, and he said very little of
substance. When the crowd in Ann
Arbor erupted after the president
said, "Go Blue!" I didn't roll my eyes
like I did in Iowa.
Call it hypocrisy, parochialism or
whatever suits you best. From poli-
tics to personal relationships, we
give passes to those we agree with
for doing similar things to those we
don't. To borrow the construction
of journalist Sydney Harris: We're
ideological and they're partisan.
We play aggressive and they play
dirty.
This frame of mind isn't ben-
eficial to anyone. It's what leads to
gridlock, it's what leads to a wid-
ening partisan gap and it's what
ultimately leads to hatrmes no mat-
ter what political party or leader is
responsible.

If passed, the ballot proposal would
allow citizens to possess marijuana in small
amounts. The initiative is led by the Campaign
to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol. The
group's goal is to control the illicit drug and
take it out of the underground market, earning
state revenue off taxation and keeping it out of
the hands of young people. In 2006, a similar
proposal was up for vote in the state but failed
largely due to the lack of funding for advertis-
ing. Today, with a well-established medical
marijuana industry in Colorado to fund cam-
paigning, the ballot is expected to be more
widely accepted.
While medical marijuana is legal in Colora-
do, the current system is in need of change. The
state has seen countless dispensaries pop up in
the last decade. Many communities are angry
at the pot-peddlers that cater to customers
who some deem ineligible for medical canna-
bis. About 88,000 Colorado residents currently
have medical marijuana cards. Of these, an
unusually large number are men in their 20s
and 30s. The federal government complicates
the issue by shutting down legal dispensaries
in Colorado and across the nation that have
"stepped outside their legal boundaries," even
though those boundaries remain largely unde-
fined. By legalizing cannabis, Colorado resi-

dents would be rid of the shroud of hypocrisy
surrounding medical marijuana use.
When a similar legalization effort was put
on the ballot in California in Nov. 2010, stark
opposition was seen by the state's beer indus-
try. Since Colorado hosts Coors and countless
other private microbreweries, the proposal
may face the same opposition. Alcohol indus-
tries opposed to the bill view marijuana as a
form of unwelcome competition. In this fight
for recreational dollars, the alcohol industry
doesn't have much of an argument. In a recent
study published in The New York Times,
researchers found thatsmokingthe equivalent
of a joint a day for seven years has no appar-
ent effect on lung function. Alternatively,
thousands of deaths are caused by alcohol's
long-term health effects. The alcohol indus-
try's arguments are driven by self-interest and
should not be taken into account by voters.
Young and old alike will continue to smoke
marijuana whether it's made legal or not.
Though the current abuse of the medical mari-
juana system raises doubts about legalization,
the decriminalization of marijuana would cre-
ate a safer and more efficient way to deal with
the issue. Colorado voters should choose to
legalize cannabis to better control substances
in their state.

As students at a university, that as a result of reduced state funding continuously increases tuition,

Obama's poor human rights record

We need to elect Obama to
another term in office
TO THE DAILY:
Dear Mr. President:
The night followingyour Fridayvisitto cam-
pus, thousands of dollars in potential campaign
contributions were spent on cheapbeer and the
momentary escape from a tired future in a bro-
ken world. For us students, it's a weekly exer-
cise in avoiding the confrontation of problems
we no longer believe we can solve. Our dreams
have been tempered by cynicism, and our fears
have been enflamed by anger and hatred. We
have lowered our sights and raised our guard.
We still believe in change, but the more things
change, the more they seem the same.
President is uninformed on
auto industry, student debt
TO THE DAILY:
Michigan residents should be deeply
offended by President Barack Obama's
remarks in Michigan on Friday. The Presi-
dent credited himself for bringing auto jobs
back to Michigan, when in fact the automo-
tive industry was bailed out by the American
taxpayer at our own expense.
In a time when millions of Americans face
bankruptcy, it's an outrage that such large
companies with power and privilege are
bailed out for their own mistakes. To show
up in Michigan and boast of such crony capi-
talism and imply that Michigan's vote can
be bought for a price is truly an insult, to all
Michigan residents and especially to those
working for auto companies that were not
bailed out.
Adding insult to injury, the president
chose one of America's most expensive public
universities to demand college costs be held
in check, when in actual fact it is his own
policy of giving easy credit and large loans to
college students that spurs the skyrocketing

In your office resides the power to reverse
millennia of human suffering. The great-
est statesmen have wanted nothing more and
demanded nothing less. They have refused
"the tranquilizing drug of gradualism." For
them, there was no such thing as a political
necessity. There were only necessary politics.
And so, late Friday night and early Satur-
day morning we toasted to four more years.
We do wish you four more years. For the
American undergraduate, college is our own
four-year term. It's a term of learning and
growth. It's a time of little responsibility and
great exploration. It is, above all else, four
more years before we too must enter a world
yet to be repaired.

cost of education. Indeed, rising tyition costs
at the University of Michigan significantly
outpace the inflation rate.
The national student loan debt is now over
$1 trillion, and unfair bankruptcy laws that
exempt student debt from bankruptcy pro-
tection are leading hundreds of thousands of
bright young people into a lifetime of crush-
ing debt.
As usual, the president invokes the rhetoric
of class warfare and the fallacies of Keynes-
ian economics to justify what are nothing
more than wealth distribution schemes.
Only Ron Paul has the presence of mind
and the courage to speak the truth about
students loans: that just as easy lending laws
enabled banks to make billions on mortgage-
backed securities while millions lost their
homes, easy student loans are a snare for
students who take them, and a barrier to the
education of those who cannot get a loan.
The only winner is the banks.
This is one more reason why informed and
serious students support Congressman Ron
Paul for president.
Vincent Patsy
University alum and Campus Coordinator for
Michigan for Ron Paul

President Barack Obama's recent campus visit, fol-
lowing his highly touted State of the Union address,
has elicited a predictable upsurge of sycophantic
praise for the president. A recent viewpoint written on
behalf of the University's chapter of the College Demo-
crats stressed how "honored" we all should feel for his
brief 30-minute campaign speech. However, praise for
Obama seems to be based more on the fact that he's less
insane than the Republican frontrunners and members
of Congress rather than on his actual record of accom-
plishments. A critical examination of Obama's major
domestic initiatives and foreign policy actions reveals
not only significant discontinuities, but even exacerba-
tion of some of the most egregious policies established
by the Bush administration.
It didn't take long after Election Day 2008 for
Obama to show what kind of "change" he so proudly
proclaimed during his campaign. Almost immediate-
ly upon assuming office, the Obama administration
gave Bush administration officials full immunity from
criminal prosecution for what every major human
rights group, the United Nations and multiple army
general investigators have termed war crimes. Instead
of focusing on war criminals, Obama has vigorously
prosecuted whistleblowers who've exposed govern-
ment waste and crimes at a higher rate than all other
previous administrations combined. Daniel Ellsberg,
the highly respected journalist who leaked the Penta-
gon Papers, stated that Obama was worse than Bush
and Nixon on such issues. Obama's hypocritical excus-
al of the Bush administration's crimes, with the osten-
sible desire to "look forward" while at the same time
prosecuting the heroic whistleblower Thomas Drake
for exposing the fraud and illegality of the previous
administration's National Security Agency, is simply
inexcusable. All of this is coming from a president who
campaigned specifically on transparency and rule of
law and a strong critique of the Bush administration's
lawlessness.
Just in the past month, Obama signed the National
Defense Authorization Act into law. The Act gives the
U.S. government the right to indefinitely detain nearly
anyone, including American citizens, without charge
or trial. This has been bitterly condemned by the
American Civil Liberties Union and many other civil
liberties organizations for its blatant unconstitutional-
ity and violation of international law. While Obama has
asserted that his administration will choose to inter-
pret the new provision in a way that does not allow
detention of American citizens, this has no bearing
whatsoever on how a President Mitt Romney might

choose to interpret the law. The ability to indefinitely
detain citizens without charge or trial has been the
hallmark of authoritarian governments and is a viola-
tion of our constitutional and human rights.
Another Bush initiative that Obama has vastly
expanded is the use of drone strikes in Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. The media typically
presents a sanitized picture of these strikes against
"militants" that dehumanizes the victims of U.S.
bombing while only briefly mentioning the cold and
calculating collateral damage. So far, the number of
children killed by drone strikes authorized by Obama
has reached nearly 200. In fact, of the 2,000 people
killed in these strikes, very few have even been identi-
fied. This has made it difficult to assess who exactly is
being killed and what justification there is for killing
them. The utter lack of oversight and accountability
involved in these operations has caused Human Rights
Watch to call for an end to drone operations until the
Obama administration can show they were lawful and
didn't disproportionately kill civilians. The admin-
istration has refused to honor the ACLU's Freedom
of Information requests regarding the drone attacks,
allowing the administration to continue killing whom-
ever it pleases at will while keeping victims invisible
and as far from the public mind as possible. If we were
forced to look into the faces of the innocent who have
been so recklessly killed by U.S. bombing before see-
ing Obama's speech on campus, perhaps we might feel
more outraged than honored by his presence.
While it's understandable that most college students
are concerned with Obama's education policy and what
he'll do for Michigan, it's important to remember what
most of us claim to believe about human rights. If we,
as a student body, have a minimal level of moral integ-
rity, we should be willing to stand against the numer-
ous well-documented ongoing human rights violations
committed by the Obama administration. While I
haven't mentioned even a fraction of this administra-
tion's abuses here, these examples speak strongly to
this administrations disregard for the rule of law and
human rights. It's time for liberals to stop ignoring
these issues and acting as though the only criticisms of
the president must come from conservatives. Instead
of blindly supporting this president due to the fear of
a worse alternative, we should be doing whatever is
in our power to end government abuses carried out in
our name, no matter what political party or leader is
responsible.

Missing 'Community'

The premiering fil, "For a Good Time, Call ..." was offered a $2 million distribution deal from Focus Features.
Sun dance delivers

Independent film
festival brought
raunchy fun to A2
By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer
The streets surrounding East
Liberty were swarmed late
Thursday night as the Michigan
Theater played host to a little
piece of Sundance Film Festival.
The lines streaming out of the
theater - though bested by those
filled with hopeful attendees of
* President Obama's speech out-
side the Union earlier the same
day - illustrated the amount
of support and curiosity for the
independent cinema hosted at the
theater.
Inside, the usually noticeable
staircase and chandelier were
lost in a sea of heads. All who
entered were greeted by gigantic,
golden snowflakes projected onto
the opulent ceiling.
When executive director Russ
Collins finally walked out to
introduce the premiering film,
"For a Good Time, Call ...," he was
greeted by deafening applause.
Attendees sent a loud and clear
message - they were there for an
event, not just a movie.
The film's director, Jamie
Travis, aroused the expectant
crowd's attention by saying: "I
know you're here for something
raunchy ... I hope you're satisfied."

Judging by the laughter echo-
ing through the theater's main
hall in the hour-and-a-half that
followed, Travis's wish may very
well have come true. The audi-
ence viewed a "Bridesmaids"-
esque female comedy revolving
around two college enemies
united after graduation by their
mutual friend Jesse (Justin Long,
"Funny People"). Katie (Ari
Graynor, "The Sitter") needs a
roommate to help pay her apart-
ment's steep rent and Lauren
(Lauren Miller, "50/50") needs
somewhere to live after getting
dumped by her egocentric boy-
friend Charlie (James Wolk, "You
Again").
When Lauren loses her job, she
joins Katie as a business partner
in her secret night-time business:
a phone sex hotline. According
to first-time screenwriter Katie
Anne Naylon, this premise wasn't
just a figment of her imagination.
"I briefly had a phone sex line
in my college dorm," said the
Florida State alum.
Producers Naylon and Miller
found the initial funding to create
the project from Miller's brother,
investment banker Dan Miller.
Naylon later contacted Travis
after reading a New York Times
profile on him, and he was on
board within a matter of weeks.
"I loved how 'estrogenic' this
was. I loved how daring this was.
We automatically formed this
great group of four at Lauren's
table and created the film," Tra-

vis recalled.
It seems Dan Miller wasn't
the only one who valued the
script's bravado. Twenty-four
hours after premiering in Sun-
dance, the film was offered a
$2 million distribution deal by
Focus Features, joining a group
of 11 other Sundance films that
garnered distributors.
But Thursday night wasn't
about distribution deals for the
individuals behind "For a Good
Time, Call ..." - it was about the
people in the audience.
"Although we've already had
our world premiere, this feels
more like one because the people
(who) are watching this film (are)
the people we made this film for,"
Travis said.
He added: "The response was
great ... I kept thinking, 'You guys
are missing all the jokes, stop
laughing!"'
The audience also heard sexy
jokes told by members of the
film's crew present for the event,
including Miller, Naylon, Travis
and 'U' alum Wolk. At one point,
Miller dished about the only
statement co-star Mimi Rog-
ers made about ex-husband Tom
Cruise during filming - "He real-
ly likes riding motorcycles."
For Travis, the night ended on
a hopeful note: "I'm going to Can-
ada tomorrow to do a KFC com-
mercial, but if the film continues
to do so well, hopefully I'll be
back in the movie business really
soon."

Fifty-three days have
passed since the most
recent episode of "Com-
munity" aired. In those 53 days,
Liz Lemon got a boyfriend, "Jus-
tified" returned and "Homeland"
won a Golden
Globe. But
none of these
successes
can make me
forget about
the blatant
lack of Green-
dale in my KAYLA
life. I can't UPADHYAVA
stop thinking
about all of
the unreal-
ized Jeff Winger speeches, Troy
and Abed shenanigans, and
Britta leather jackets that we've
been denied.
This past November, NBC omi-
nously announced a midseason
schedule devoid of "Community,"
the oft-experimental and most
innovative sitcom you're appar-
ently not watching. Instantly,
Twitter and Facebook erupted
in a fury of expletives and witty
references. I'm still pumping out
tweets ending with "#savecom-
munity" and urging my friends to
kidnap their unfriendly neighbor-
hood NBC execs or occupy Rob-
ert Greenblatt's office.
NBC has assured distressed
fans that the show will finish
filming and air at least the rest
of the season (Troy and Abed in
the ... TBD). But it's clear "Com-
munity" hasn't brought in the
revenue necessary to keep the
big bad network execs satisfied,
and there's little we Human
Beings can do to stop them from
huffing and puffing and blow-
ing Greendale all the way to the
Dark Timeline. Not even Abed as
Batman can save us.
The Legion of Mainstream
Awards Shows was our only hope,
and now it might be too late. I've
been following red carpet events
long enough to know that when it
comes to television, nomination
committees just can't seem to get
it right. I'm still not convinced
that the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association actually watches
television.
As much as I hate giving so
much power to awards shows,
they do affect television ratings.

The viewership of "Mad Men"
increased significantly after the
show raked in several consecu-
tive awards, and "Modern Fam-
ily" became Wednesday night's
highest rated program after win-
ning its Emmy.
After years of my favorite
shows getting snubbed, you'd
think I wouldn't get too worked
up during nomination announce-
ments. But the fact that people
aren't throwing all the awards at
"Community" continues to baffle
me.
It all comes down to the eccen-
tricity of "Community." It's a
show about a community college
study group, but it's also a show
about alternate realities, apoca-
lyptic paintball battles, space
buses and secret-air-conditioner-
repairman societies. The scruffy
and sassy genius Dan Harmon
created "Community" for an odd-
ball audience made up of people
who wear costumes to midnight
releases of comic-book-based
films, speak in puns and still
haven't recovered from the can-
cellation of "Freaks and Geeks"
or "Arrested Development."
Unfortunately, though we
make up about 90 percent of
Twitter users, we're a small
demographic of inter-nerds and
TV junkies who have many a
limited-edition collector's lunch
box but nary a Nielson box. But
the value of a fresh and daring
show like "Community" isn't
something a Nielson box can
calculate.
And while the Golden Globes
are always trying to be "edgy"
and "new" in order to attract a
younger and more diverse audi-
ence, they are about as cutting-
edge as an episode of "The Big
Bang Theory," CBS's time-slot
competitor to "Community."
Some of the best comedies
are those that break the sitcom
mold and take risks, but these
shows don't necessarily bring in
awards. "30 Rock," which can
be as bizarre as "Community,"
is an obvious exception, as it has
received countless awards. But
one of its huge pulls is the popu-
larity of its stars, Tina Fey and
Alec Baldwin. "Community" has
comedy veteran Chevy Chase
and Joel McHale of "The Soup,"
but they aren't the focus - it's an

ensemble show, and many of its
actors are still newbies by Hol-
lywood standards.
Awards shons also love com-
edies that mix feel-good comedy
with social issues. "Glee" caters
to this notion, dedicating epi-
sodes to issues like homophobia
or teen drinking, resolving prob-
lems quickly and then dropping
the issue or watering it down
with a song and dance. The seri-
ous moments are obvious and
trite, making it mindless comedy.
"Modern Family" is sometimes
guilty of this, too.
Too good for
the red carpet.
"Community" makes us
think. At the surface level, it's a
whirlwind of pop culture refer-
ences and absurdity. But these
characters are real people with
real problems - problems that
can't be resolved in one episode
or even a whole season. Jeff has
been dealing with his compli-
cated feelings toward Annie
since season one, Abed's familial
issues are a recurring theme and
Britta is always struggling to
balance her abrasive personality
with a desire to fit in.
No other sitcom can pull off
a Christmas claymation episode
crafted with equal parts wit and
character development, or an
episode about a normal gather-
ing of friends and pizza that
turns into an ingeniously spun
web of six alternate timelines.
This show wasn't designed for
the masses or for mainstream-
awards attention, but if the
all-powerful peacock decides to
make "Community" join Horse-
bot 3000 in its grave, NBC won't
just be forcing us to say goodbye
to the best ensemble on televi-
sion - they'll be setting back
comedy and condemning uncon-
ventionality in sitcoms. Let's be
real, they'll be Britta-ing televi-
sion for the rest of us.

Alluring 'Lost Girl'
combines sexy, sci-fi

Neeson prevails in 'Grey'

In the world of genre tele-

assumption that a bigger budget

millions of
viewers tune in every week to
see the fantastic, heavily stylized
visual effects. But some of the
best genre shows of all time, such
as "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and
its spinoff "Angel," operated on
modest budgets, relying instead
on the abilities of their casts and
strength of their stories to craft
spellbinding, evolving shows.
"Lost Girl" - a supernatu-
ral crime drama that debuted
in Canada in 2010 before being
picked up by Syfy this year - has
low production value, but that
hardly detracts from the show.
Yes, the makeup and costumes
are sometimes hideous, and the
special effects are painstakingly
'90s-esque. And of course itwould
be nice for all genre shows to have
the production value of "Game of
Thrones," "The Vampire Diaries"
or "The Walking Dead." But "Lost
Girl" has plenty going for it, and to
simply write it off because it looks
cheap would be unfair.
The show follows Bo (Anna
Silk, "Being Erica"), a stunningly
beautiful bartender who is irre-
sistible to just about everyone.

despite the
slightly heavy

it tries to peddle, doesn't disap-

nal (if not believable), the action
is nail-bitingly good, and best
of all, there's not a single idiotic
pun anywhere.
Writer-director Joe Carna-
han ("The A-Team"), known for
a particularly irritating brand
of overblown and over-directed
adventure flicks, somehow man-
ages to avoid the trap of making
set pieces a higher priority than
actors. The effects are felt clear-
ly at every gripping turn. Each
character is properly fleshed out
and has a distinctive voice that
adds to the rather somber base of
morality the film has been built
around. But Carnahan and new-
comer Ian MacKenzie Jeffers,
who wrote the short story that
inspired the film, don't give us
much of a chance to get too lost
in the bleakness, creating raw
tension through their surpris-
ingly original script.
It's obvious from the get-go
that Neeson is the driving force
behind this film and he adopts
the role well, letting his perfor-

situation. The character he
plays, John Ottoway, is a wolf

OPINION
From Page 1A
"I think that he brought some-
thing to the table that was going
to relate to us," Hornstein said.
"He talked about affordable
education, something that is all
near and dear to our hearts and I
think he gave a call to action a lot
of times ... I definitely think he
inspired people, which is what I
was looking for."
Tee Thompson, who owns
an independent event produc-
tion company in Detroit, said
she was impressed to see Sec-
retary of Education Arne Dun-
can attend the event, which she
added showed the importance of
affordable higher education to
the Obama administration.
"I was standing next to a stu-
dent who said she's in law school
and her current loan amount
is $200,000," Thompson said.
"To look at rewarding higher
institutions as a result of them
impacting the students and the
reduction of tuition is important,
that is significant to taking our

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

country to the next level."
Some of those in the crowd
said their views of Obama have
changed since his election in
2008. LSA senior Kerith Asma,
who waited in line for five hours
for her ticket to see the presi-
dent, said she has become disil-
lusioned with Obama.
"I've definitely been a little bit
disappointed in the execution of
his policies and how things have
gone," Asma said. "But at this
point, I'll probably still vote for
Obama based on the lack of qual-
ity Republican candidates."
Engineering junior Dan
Caldwell waited nine hours for
his ticket and said the past four
years have strengthened his sup-
port for Obama.
"I actually like Obama more
than I did when he was going
into office," Caldwell said. "I
didn't have a lot of faith in him
because there was a lack of the
type of experience I typically
look for, but I definitely like him
a lot better now that's been four
years."
Caldwell added that he would
also wait nine hours to hear a
speech from the top Republi-

can candidate. As an indepen-
dent and a first-time voter in a
presidential election, Caldwell
attended the event to hear about
Obama's policies, which he hopes
to have the opportunity to do for
the emerging Republican candi-
date as well.
University alum Karen
Wanza, who volunteered for the
Obama campaign in 2008, attrib-
uted mounting criticism that
the president has failed to enact
change to the Republicans hold-
ing a majority in Congress and
blocking legislative initiatives.
"I feel sorry for him," Wanza
said. "I don't think he realized it
would be such a setback with the
Republicans crippling Washing-
ton."
University alum Bruce Sander-
son compared Obama's struggle
to pass legislation in Congress
to junior quarterback Denard
Robinson's fight to persevere
through the opponents' defense
during Michigan football games.
"Obama could be Denard, but
he's got Boehner on his heels
dragging him down," Sanderson
said. "If we could manage to get
free of Boehner or get some more

defense, we could maybe make
some progress."
While the crowd was largely
comprised of Obama supporters,
a group of about 25 vocalizing
a variety of complaints against
President Obama protested out-
side the field house during his
speech.
While the University's chapter
of College Republicans decided
not to participate in the protest,
some members of the official
branches of the Republican Party
in the state came out to demon-
strate their opposition toward
the president.
Norm Shinkle, chair of the
Republican Party in Ingham
County, said there were people
from multiple counties around
Michigan protesting against
Obama's policies.
"We just want our president
and his friends to know that
there are some people who think
he hasn't done a very good job
and that he shouldn't get reelect-
ed," Shinkle said.
Multiple student protest-
ers said they did not approve of
Obama's economic policies, but
they were not against Obama's

presence at the University.
LSA junior Matt Jones, the
student coordinator of the pro-
test, said while it was an honor
to have the president speak at the
University, he protested to rep-
resent the percentage of Michi-
gan residents that "completely
disagree with the direction the
president is takingthe country."
Engineering freshman Sam
Shrago agreed with Jones, add-
ing that he feels the president's
policies have hurt businesses and
decreased job opportunities.
"We respect the office of the
presidency, but we just believe
he's done a terrible job and he's
killing businesses and killing
jobs," Shrago said.
Jones added that protestors
did not intend to "take cheap
shots at President Obama," refer-
ring specifically to the actions
of protesters toward Republi-
can House Majority Leader Eric
Cantor, when he spoke atthe Uni-
versity in October. Inthe middle of
Cantor's speech, protesters associ-
ated with the Occupy movement
stood up and turned their backs to
Cantor.
The protesters outside of

Obama's speech included those
who were anti-abortion, anti-
fracking, anti-Israel and Tea Party
members. LSA sophomore Joe
Lipa, events chair of Students for
Life, an anti-abortion advocacy
group, said he was frustrated that
the issue of abortion has become
less of a prominent issue of nation-
al debate.
"We're seeing unprecedented
attacks both on the unborn and
also on religious freedoms," Lipa
said.
While most of the protesters
left after the majority of ticket
holders entered the field house,
three people showed up to pro-
test hydraulic fracturing - the
process of inserting water and
chemicals in the ground to
extract natural gas - in Michi-
gan when attendees left the
event.
LuAnne Kozma, cofounder of
Ban Michigan Fracking, said her
group aims to ban fracking com-
pletely since it allows dangerous
chemicals to enter the ground-
water supply.
"We already know that frack-
ing isn't safe and that it is never
going to be safe," Kozma said.

At Sexpertise, students learn about sexual health

UHS sponsors
events, activities to
foster discussion
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily StaffReporter
While Why Pornography Mat-
ters and Body Mapping aren't
your typical college classes, last
week students had the opportu-
nity to attend such classes at the
University's fourth annual Sex-
pertise conference.
The event, which was held at
the Michigan League last week
from Wednesday to Friday, fos-
tered discussion on a variety

of topics dealing with sexual
health, relationships and the
role of sex in society. Members
of Sexperteam - a sexual health
education group comprised of
students and sponsored by Uni-
versity Health Service - hosted
the conference in an effort to
promote increased discussion of
sexuality on campus.
Brittany Sandefur, a UHS
sexual health educator, said
she thought Sexpertise was a
success, noting that about 150
people attended the three-day
event.
"It went really well," Sand-
efur said. "We had a little bit of
a lower turn-out than we would
have hoped for, but the people

that did come got a lot out of it
and the presentations were real-
ly great."
Though it was Sandefur's first
year overseeing Sexpertise, she
said she believes sexual educa-
tion is an important part of cam-
pus life.
"It's important to continue
to have these kinds of conver-
sations on campus," Sandefur
said. "It can be surprising how
infrequently they happen and
how students don't have enough
information about their bodies ...
So it's good to have these conver-
sations often so that everyone
has the information they need to
make safer, healthy decisions for
themselves"

University alums Laura
McAndrew and Olga Semenova,
former members of Sexperteam,
held a presentation at this year's
Sexpertise called, Pleasure:
What you have and how to use it.
Participants who came to their
presentation played interactive
games that cultivated discussion
on sex, including drawing cards
with an activity on it and lining
up in order of riskiness.
In an interview after the
event, McAndrew said she hopes
Sexpertise helps students feel
more comfortable discussing
their sexuality.
"There's so much learning
that can be done and so many
resources on the (University)

campus for learning more about
sexuality," McAndrew said "...
Sexual health is a really impor-
tant part of everyone's general
health and that there's no need
to feel embarrassed about seek-
ing out information or seeking
out healthcare related to sex and
sexuality."
McAndrew said Sexpertise
has evolved since its first con-
ference, as organizers have been
able to better pinpoint topics
of relevance for University stu-
dents.
"When Sexpertise started,
there was probably less certainty
about the audience and we've
really been able to identify what
students are looking for in the

program," McAndrew said.
Semenova credited the pro-
gram's evolution to the sugges-
tions of participants in years
past.
"Every event has evaluation
afterwards," Semenova added.
"So if they express they want
something on a different topic,
it's possible to get that topic
goingthe next year."
LSA sophomore Billy Diaz,
who attended McAndrew and
Semenova's presentation, said he
enjoyed the games and interac-
tive aspect of Sexpertise.
"It's awesome," Diaz said. "I
think (Sexperteam is) a great
group who likes educating peo-
ple and they're good at it."

Occupy Oakland protestors burn an American flag found inside Oakland City Hall during an Occupy Oakland protest on the steps of City Hall, Saturday.
Occupy protest resurfaces in
Oakland, clashes with police

Over 400 arrested,
0 City Hall broken
into and vandalized
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - For
weeks the protests had waned,
with only a smattering of people
taking to Oakland's streets for
occasional weekend marches
that bore little resemblance to
the headline-grabbing Occupy
demonstrations of last fall.
Then came Saturday, which
started peacefully enough - a
midday rally at City Hall and
a march. But hours later, the
scene near downtown Oakland
had dramatically deteriorated:
clashes punctuated by rock and
bottle throwing by protest-
ers and volleys of tear gas from
police, and a City Hall break-in
that left glass cases smashed,
graffiti spray-painted on walls
and an American flag burned.
More than 400 people were
arrested on charges ranging
from failure to disperse to van-
dalism, police spokesman Sgt.
Jeff Thomason said. At least
three officers and one protester
were injured.
On Sunday, Oakland officials
vowed to be ready if Occupy
protesters try to mount another
large-scale demonstration. Pro-
testers, meanwhile, decried Sat-
urday's police tactics as illegal
and threatened to sue.
Mayor Jean Quan person-
ally inspected damage caused by
dozens of people who broke into
City Hall. She said she wants a
court order to keep Occupy pro-
testers who have been arrested
several times out of Oakland,
which has been hit repeatedly
by demonstrations that have
cost the financially troubled city
about $5 million.
Quan also called on the
loosely organized movement to
"stop using Oakland as its play-
ground."
"People in the community and
people in the Occupy movement
have to stop making excuses for
this behavior," she said.

Saturday's protests - the
most turbulent since Oakland
police forcefully dismantled an
Occupy encampment in Novem-
ber - came just days after the
announcement of a new round
of actions. The group said it
planned to use a vacant building
as a social center and political
hub and threatened to try to shut
down the Port of Oakland for a
third time, occupy the airport
and take over City Hall.
After the mass arrests, the
Occupy Oakland Media Com-
mittee criticized the police's
conduct, saying that most of
the arrests were made illegally
because police failed to allow
protesters to disperse. It threat-
ened legal action.
"Contrary to their own pol-
icy, the OPD gave no option of
leaving or instruction on how
to depart. These arrests are
completely illegal, and this will
probably result in another class
action lawsuit against the OPD,"
a release from the group said.
Deputy Police Chief Jeff Isra-
el told reporters late Saturday
that protesters gathered unlaw-
fully and police gave them mul-
tiple verbal warnings to disband.
"These people gathered with
the intent of unlawfully enter-
ing into a building that does not
belong to them and assaulting
the police," Israel said. "It was
not a peaceful group."
Earlier this month, a court-
appointed monitor submitted
a report to a federal judge that
included "serious concerns"
about the department's handling
of the Occupy protests. Police
officials say they were in "close
contact" with the federal moni-
tor during the protests.
The national Occupy Wall
Street movement, which
denounces corporate excess
and economic inequality, began
in New York City in the fall but
has been largely dormant lately.
Oakland, New York and Los
Angeles were among the cit-
ies with the largest and most
vocal Occupy protests early on.
The demonstrations ebbed after

those cities used force to move
out hundreds of demonstrators
who had set up tent cities.
Caitlin Manning, an Occupy
Oakland member, believes that
Saturday's protest caught the
world's attention.
"The Occupy movement is
back on the map," Manning said
Sunday. "We think those who
have been involved in move-
ments elsewhere should be
heartened."
In Oakland, social activ-
ism and civic unrest have long
marked this rough-edged city
of nearly 400,000 across the bay
from San Francisco. Beset by
poverty, crime and a decades-
long tense relationship between
the police and the community,
its streets have seen clashes
between officers and protesters,
including anti-draft protests in
the 1960s that spilled into town
from neighboring Berkeley.
Before the Occupy movement
spawned violence, mass arrests
and two shutdowns of the Port
of Oakland, the city was disrupt-
ed by a series of often-violent
demonstrations over a white Bay
Area Rapid Transit officer's fatal
shooting of an unarmed black
man named Oscar Grant on New
Year's Day 2009.
Occupy protesters have
invoked Grant's memory, refer-
ring to the downtown plaza
named after Frank Owaga,
the city's first Asian-American
councilmember, by renaming
the former space they occupied
with tents as Oscar Grant Plaza.
Hundreds of Occupiers again
descended on the plaza to reflect
on Saturday and discuss what's
next.
Dozens of officers, who main-
tained guard at City Hall over-
night, were also on the scene
Sunday.
"They were never able to
occupy a building outside of
City Hall," Interim Police Chief
Howard Jordan said Sunday.
"We suspect they will try to go
to the convention center again.
They will not get in."
Jordan said they will call

for mutual aid from other law
enforcement agencies if needed
Sunday and defended his offi-
cers' response to the protesters
on Saturday.
"No we have not changed
our tactics," Jordan said. "The
demonstrators have changed
their tactics, which forces us to
respond differently."
Quan, who faces two mayoral
recall attempts, has been criti-
cized for past police tear-gas-
sing, though she said she was not
aware of the plans. On Saturday,
she thought the police response
was measured, adding that she
has lost patience with the costly
and disruptive protests.
She also said she hopes pros-
ecutors will seek a stay-away
order against protesters who
have been arrested multiple
times.
"It appears that most of them
constantly come from outside of
Oakland," Quan said. "I think
a lot of the young people who
come to these demonstrations
think they're being revolution-
ary when they're really hurting
the people they claim that they
are representing."
Saturday's events began when
a group assembled outside City
Hall and marched through the
streets, disrupting traffic as they
threatened to take over a vacant
convention center.
The protesters then walked
to the convention center, where
some started tearing down
perimeter fencing and "destroy-
ing construction equipment"
shortly before 3 p.m., police said.
The number of demonstrators
swelled as the day wore on, with
afternoon estimates ranging up
to 2,000 people, although city
leaders say that figure was much
closer to several hundred.
A majority of the arrests
came after police took scores of
protesters into custody as they
marched through downtown,
with some entering a YMCA
building, Thomason said.
One of those taken into custo-
dy at the facility was KGO radio
reporter Kristin Hanes.

Rupture comes as
Egypt bars several
Westerners from
leaving country
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's For-
eign Ministry said yesterday it
has ended a contract with three
Washington lobbying firms to
cut expenses, denying reports
that the Americans were the
ones to sever the contract.
The rupture occurred as Cairo
faces criticism from Washington
for banning at least10Americans
and Europeans from leaving the
country as part of an investig
ation into foreign-funded civil
society organizations. Among
those barred was Sam LaHood
of the U.S.-based International
Republican Institute, who is the
son of U.S. Transportation Sec-
retary Ray LaHood.
The ban sparked anger in the
United States, and Washington
warned on Tuesday that the
campaign raised concerns about
Egypt's transition to democracy
and could jeopardize American
aid that Egypt's battered econ-
omy needs badly after a year of
political and social unrest.
The travel ban was part of an
Egyptian criminal investigation
into foreign-funded democracy
organizations after soldiers
raided the offices of 10 such
groups last month, including the
IRI and its sister organization,
the National Democratic Insti-
tute, as well as several Egyptian
organizations.
The Egyptian investigation is
closely linked with the political
turmoil that has engulfed the
country since the fall of Hosni
Mubarak nearly a year ago. The
generals who took power after
Mubarak's fall have accused
"foreign hands" of being behind
protests against their rule, and
they frequently depict the pro-
testers themselves as receiving
foreign funds in a plot to desta-
bilize the country.
The December raids have
drew sharp U.S. criticism, and

President Barack Obama has
spoken by telephone with Field
Marshal Hussein Tantawi, the
head of the ruling military coun-
cil, to emphasize "the role that
these organizations can play in
civil society," State Department
spokeswoman Victoria Nuland
said Thursday.
The Egyptian Foreign Minis-
try's statement was issued two
days after Politico reported that
former Republican Rep. Bob Liv-
ingston, former Democratic Rep.
Toby Moffett and longtime lob-
byist Tony Podesta ended their
contract with the Egyptian gov-
ernment.
The lobbyists confirmed in
a statement Saturday that they
were immediately terminat-
ing their four-year relationship
with the Egyptian government.
"We hope that Egyptians
continue to enjoy the deepen-
ing of democracy in their coun-
try, and that Egypt remains a
strong, stable and vital ally of
the United States," the three
lobbyists said in a joint state-
ment.
Politico reported earlier that
the firms came under criticism
after circulating talking points
justifying Egyptian security
forces' raids on a number of
NGOs including American
groups.
Meanwhile, a delegation from
Egypt's Defense Ministry has
arrived in New York, Egypt's
state news agency reported.
MENA quoted military atta-
che Gen. Mohammed el-Kishki
as saying that the visit was
aimed at discussing "coopera-
tion between the two countries
in military affairs."
Egypt's army, which took
power after the February 2011
ouster of Hosni Mubarak,
receives 1.3 billion dollars a year
in U.S. foreign assistance.
The country's aid pack-
age has come under pressure
by members of Congress who
want assurances that Egypt
will abide by a 1979 peace treaty
with Israel, and that the mili-
tary rulers will respect demo-
cratic freedoms.

PETITION
From Page 1A
Raiman, who signed the petition,
said he stands by its objectives.
"We do have the same goals as
this professor or this group of pro-
fessors who created the petition
and we're supportive of the same
cause," Raiman said.
The petition expresses opposi-
tion to the classification of GSRAs
as public employees as this vio-
lates the precedent of a 1981
Michigan Employment Relations
Commission ruling.
"The rationale underlying that
decision was based on the fact
that the primary role of GSRAs is
to conduct research in support of
attaining graduate degrees," the
petition states.
The petition was initially
launched on Ulaby's academic
website, but he was forced to move
it as he was in violation of Universi-
ty policy, accordingto a statement
released on Friday by the Gradu-

ate Employees' Organization - the
union representing graduate stu-
dents on campus. The page now
directs users to a new site from
which they can sign the petition.
An e-mail sent by Ulaby at 12:50
p.m. on Friday and obtained by
The Michigan Daily encouraged
Engineering graduate students to
sign the petition.
"Establishing a union for Grad-
uate Student Research Assistants
(GSRAs) would be detrimental to
their educational goals and would
change the collaborative men-
tor/mentee relationship between
a faculty adviser and a gradu-
ate student into an adversarial
employer/employee relationship,"
the e-mail read. "If you agree with
my statement, I invite you to join
me by signing the open letter to
the Regents."
According to Raiman, the use
of an official listserv to solicit
signatures garnered some contro-
versy, particularly those opposed
to Ulaby's message. The e-mail
also stated at the bottom its direct

affiliation with the University.
"This message is an official
communication from the College
of Engineering of the University
of Michigan to the students," the
e-mail stated.
A GEO statement on Friday con-
demned the message ofthe petition.
"We were disappointed when,
on Thursday, a professor of engi-
neering established a UM web-
site petitioning the University
Regents not to recognize Gradu-
ate Student Research Assistants
as employees." the release stated.
Liz Rodrigues, GEO communi-
cations chair,said she had not seen
the e-mail sent by Ulaby. She said
GEO's feelings were expressed in
their release, but they would like
to move forward.
"Really we're just working
towards an election," Rodrigues
said.
The argument over whether
or not to classify GSRAs as public
employees will culminate with
the hearing before an administra-
tive judge on Wednesday.

OBAMA
From Page 1A
dent's student aid reforms would
mostly increase the amount of
need-based Perkins Loans avail-
able to low-income students.
"We can't do it by ourselves,"
Duncan said. "So we're going
to try to put out a $1 billion tax
incentive to states and to col-
leges to do the right thing. We're
challenging states to continue to
invest even in tough times and
we're challenging universities
to do two things - keep tuition
rates down and increase gradu-
ation rates."
Obama put pressure on Con-
gress to make the American
Opportunity Tax Credit -
which provides college students
with up to $10,000 over four
years - permanent, and to dou-
ble the number of federal work
study jobs available to students.
The Obama administration
will also boost its efforts to
make financial aid information
more accessible for families by
creating several online tools
that provide comprehensive
information about what types of
aid institutions offer.
"From now on, parents and
students deserve to know how
a college is doing - how afford-
able is it, how well are its stu-
dents doing," Obama said. "We
want you to know how well a car
stacks up before you buy it. You
should know how well a college
stacks up."
Speaking under an array of
Big Ten championship banners
and atop a platform placed upon
a block 'M' on the indoor field,
Obama also congratulated the
football team on its Sugar Bowl
win, calling the team "a force to
be reckoned with" under junior
quarterback Denard Robinson,
who was sitting among con-
gressmen and state officials dur-
ing the speech.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily before the
speech, Robinson said he was
impressed with the amount of
student support.
"It's great to see President
Obama, I couldn't miss it," Rob-
inson said. "A lot of people came
out and came to support him."
After the speech, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
lauded Obama's attention to the
need for the federal government
to collaborate with universities
around the nation in an effort
to develop efficient policies
that minimize student debt and
increase accessibility.
"College affordability is

extraordinarily important for
all of us and I was so pleased
that he recognizes the complex-
ity - the fact that the state has
a role, the federal government
has a role, universities have a
role - and all of them have to be
working together to make this
possible," Coleman said.
Coleman stressed the need for
the state to continue to invest in
higher education, particularly
following years of repeated cuts
in funding allocation to public
colleges within the state, includ-
ing a 15-percent reduction in
funding in 2011 under Republi-
can Gov. Rick Snyder.
"One of the things that
(Obama) did point out very
clearly was the dramatic disin-
vestment that the states have
made, and one of the most harsh
has been in Michigan," Coleman
said. "We have suffered from
that, and we've done a good job
of cutting costs, we've contin-
ued to try to cut costs but we
have to have a reinvestment by
the state."
Coleman added that achiev-
ing the goal of effectively work-
ing;a a thiversities, state
governments and-the- federal
government to increase college
affordability is going to be chal-
lenging, but an endeavor she is
optimistic about for the future.
"I think universities should
be challenged to find more effi-
cient ways to save money, and
we've been doing that aggres-
sively at Michigan for the past
10 years and I have no problem
finding ways," Coleman said "...
And we're unwilling to lower
quality, because I think what the
president said that is important,
is that we have the best higher
education system in the world.
And we do not want to lose that,
quality matters.
Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-
Mich.) said before the speech
that investing in higher educa-
tion is key to augmenting eco-
nomic conditions in the state,
particularly through utilizing
its vast recourses in the indus-
trial and technological fields.
"When we talk about the
future and the opportunities
for us in the technologies in the
skilled trades, engineers, sci-
ence, it doesn't happen without
education and it doesn't work
if, when you get out of school,
you've got more debt than it
would take if you were buying a
house," Stabenow said.
State Sen. Rebekah War-
ren (D-Ann Arbor) said in an
interview before the speech
that Obama's message of col-
laboration amongst all forms of

government to decrease student
debt and increase accessibility
to higher education is crucial.
"The take away is the federal
government and the state gov-
ernment can work together to
provide as many resources as
possible so that our young peo-
ple who are bright and talented
and willing to work hard to go
to college have the financial
resources to do this."
Warren added that while it's
too early to tell how the state
plans to craft its plans to invest
in higher education, she encour-
ages students to get involved
and voice their opinions.
"We've got to invest in higher
education," Warren said. "What
exactly that looks like, I'm open
to a lot of different ideas, but
I'm looking for as many young,
smart people around the table
saying what's the best way to
invest resources."
Engineering junior Dan
Caldwell said he didn't expect
Obama would have a perfect
solution to make college more
affordable, but he wants "to feel
like (Obama) cares about what's
going to happen to'us., ,
"They gave a loi of-assistance
to people when the mortgage
crisis happened ... I'd like to
see that for people coming out
of college. That similar assis-
tance will hopefully be given,"
Caldwell said. "Obviously, kids
coming out of college are the
future of the country."
LSA senior Chaim Frenkel
said while Obama's message
should resonate with all stu-
dents, he could personally relate
to what the president had to say.
"Student loans are such a pain
for all of us and I personally pay
eight times the average student
loans and it's definitely going
to be something in the future
that needs to be amended and
moving forward it's clear that
affordable education for all is a
necessary part of progressing
society," Frenkel said.
American Culture Prof. Lori
Brooks said she waited five
hours yesterday morning to get
tickets to the speech. Brooks
brought her infant son to the
speech because she wanted him
to see the country's first Afri-
can-American president.
"I'm looking forward to see-
ing my son being educated in
this country," Brooks said, "And
I'm hoping that I'll be looking
forward to my son's educational
future."

Buckeyes bully

Michigan s inexperience
reemerges in loss to Ohio State

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
COLUMBUS - No. 4 Ohio State
challenged the Michigan basketball
team to play hard-nosed, rough-
and-tumble basketball in the paint,
and Michigan responded - with a
0 whimper.
The Buckeyes physically domi-
nated the 20th-ranked Wolver-
ines inside, leaving 14 offensive
rebounds, 16 second-chance points
and dire foul trouble for Michigan
in their wake.
"They have tremendous ... tal-
ented guys," said Michigan coach
John Beilein. "What might work as
a box out against another team does
not work against them. You have to
finish every possession with a legal,
strong box out. It's just a couple
(rebounds) that we could have con-
trolled that really would have been
important in this game."
* Standing at 6-foot-3, Ohio State
guard Lenzelle Smith Jr. punished
the Wolverines with eight offen-

sive rebounds and a game-high 17
points. His 12 rebounds were also a
game high.
"I knew that was goingto be our
edge, rebounding and just doing
the little things," Smith said. "I
stuck to that early and just got
myself in a position where I could
get the rebounds. We weren't mak-
ing many shots, so it was a better
chance on getting rebounds."
Smith has forwards Jared Sull-
inger and Deshaun Thomas to
thank for his success. The two
sophomores bullied Michigan's big
men and cleared the path for Smith
to get extra looks on weak-side
rebounds and tipped balls.
"I just try to know the angle and
where the ball is going to bounce
depending where they shoot,"
Smith said. "When Jared got his
second foul, my eye lit up. I knew
it was go time and needed to go to
work."
The Buckeyes' toughness also
got the Wolverines in foul trouble.

Five sons return to Barwis for NFL preparation

In a nondescript building

found a new home for his sons.
He's training

"I'll take care

Barwis - who redefined
strength and conditioning at
Michigan for three seasons under
then-coach Rich Rodriguez -
decorated the dojo's entrance
with memories. Among the signed
jerseys, three small pictures stand
out. They show his three Michi-
gan teams, gathered at midfield
after a practice, most without
their shirts - showing off his
work - and all smiling.
Front and center stood a lean,

ing with Barwis at his Barwis-
Methods center in Plymouth gives
them the best chance to realize
their NFL dreams.
Only one framed jersey hangs
on the wall inside the dojo. It
belongs to former Michigan soc-
cer player Justin Meram, and
it's signed, "To Mike, Thanks for
kicking my ass." Flags hang from
the rafters above it - one West
Virginia and one Michigan -
reminders of how many kids he's
helped. He hasn't changed much.
On the wall by Van Bergen, Bar-
wis put up a quote from General
George Patton in big red type:
"May God have mercy on my
enemies, because I won't."
Rap music pulsed through
speakers, and Barwis screamed
at Van Bergen over DMX's "Gon'
Give it to Ya." He slapped Van
Bergen, as hard as he could, in the
ribs on each side. That was the
cue to start.
Van Bergen was at the Eccen-
tric bench, which Barwis himself

helped design. It looks like a nor-
mal bench press, but with wires
and other weights attached to
the structure, it acts asa "reverse
bench press" and forces Van Ber-
gen to pull the weight towards his
chest instead of letting gravity
pull the bar down. Then, he push-
es the weight up, using the same
muscles as a normal bench press.
Watson took a break to watch.
He's the one who needs Barwis
most. Without an invite to the
combine, unlike Molk and Mar-
tin, and without extensive game
film to take pride in, unlike Koger
and Van Bergen, Watson is a long
shot to make it to the NFL. The
tight end has one career catch
and one career touchdown to his
name. It wasn't necessarily his
fault - as he bounced between
tight end and defensive end
thanks to the coaching change,
finally landing at tight end under
Brady Hoke.
Now, Watson tells Barwis that
he's not afraid totake his shirt off
in public, that he has abs for the
first time in his life.
. He admired the 12-foot-tall
American flag on the wall behind
Van Bergen.
"He's going to knock this wall
down, push it out, then have a real
big dojo," Watson said, motioning
towards it.
Barwis will need the space if
his reputation continues to bulge
as efficiently as the guys he trains.
Not too far from Watson, Detroit
Tigers third baseman Brandon
Inge worked out, doing lunges
with bands strapped to his ankles.

"He's the best motivator I've
ever been around in my life," Inge
said of Barwis, who also has a
mixed martial arts background.
"You can't really argue with any-
thing he says, because he'll prob-
ably choke you out if you do."
Van Bergen finished his set,
jumped up and barked at Molk,
imitating DMX's woofs as the
song blared.
Like the others, Van Bergen
relishes havingtime to devote to
sculpting his body. During the
season, extra time to lift was rare.
Plus, he suffered a pinched nerve
in his neck against Michigan State
when he tried to uproot a ball car-
rier on a goal-line play - some-
thing he and Martin did routinely
all season. From that game on, he
couldn't fire his pectoral muscle
or tricep.
"Most people don't know I
played the last half of the season
without a right arm," he said.
His pinched nerve is fine
now, but he estimated he's about
70-percent recovered from a par-
tially torn ligament in his foot,
which he played through in the
Sugar Bowl. That injury won't be
fully healed for another month.
Every weekday, he meets at
the dojo at 9 a.m. and doesn't get
home until 6 p.m. On Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays, the
five have "hell days," working out
nearly every muscle in their bod-
ies. On Tuesdays and Thursdays,
they do combine-specific drills
and Barwis teaches them how to
run - the most efficient ways to
cut and to accelerate.

They take planned periodic
breaks to stretch or eat one of the
six nutritional meals Barwis maps
out for the nine-hour period.
"Every day - same meal," said
Van Bergen, who attributed half
of the credit for his toned look
to Barwis' nutrition plan. "I can
tell you exactly what I'm going
to have later: I have seven eggs,
four pieces of whole-wheat toast
and one eight-ounce cup of yogurt
waiting for me."
Van Bergen and Watson move
onto other drills, while Koger
does lunges with ankle resistance
and catches a ball thrown by one
of Barwis' assistants. Meanwhile,
across the room, one of Barwis'
star pupils puts on a show.
Laying on a bench, Molk
strengthens his neck by resisting
pressure an assistant applied by
pressinga towel to his forehead.
If you didn't know any better, you
might have thought Molk was
being tortured. After more than
10 minutes of struggling, Molk's
neck was no longer distinguish-
able, swollen and puffy.
"You look like acartoon
character," Van Bergen shouted,
laughing.
The rest of the morning, Molk,
the Rimington Trophy winner,
strengthened his strong left leg
and tested out his healing right
leg. He had surgery two weeks
ago to repair a torn tendon in his
right foot suffered minutes before
the Sugar Bowl. But it doesn't stop
Barwis, who tests Molk, making
the center push back as he applies
pressure to the leg.

"I can squat 700 pounds," Molk
gasped in between reps. "But I
(can't handle) a 190-pound man."
Barwis smiled. He'd do any-
thing for Molk. On Wednesday,
when Molk realized he had a doc-
tor's appointment for the injury
(which has a 4-month recovery
period) it was Barwis who came
in at 6 a.m. to work Molk out.
And when Molk needed a ride to
the airport, it was Barwis who
dropped everything to take him.
"I love all my guys," Barwis
would say later. "Molk's like my
son. Van Bergen's like my son.
Koger's like my son. That's how
we are."
Every day for three years, Bar-
wis worked out Martin and Molk
at the same time, mostly because
they were the only two who could
keep up with each other. They
were competitive in everything.
If Martin lifted 500, Molk put on
510. It's the kind of atmosphere
Molk envisioned when he com-
mitted to Michigan and to Bar-
Wis.
When the morning workouts
are done, Molk explains how
important strength training was
in his college choice, how the
right program could prepare
someone for the NFL and how
Barwis blew everyone away.
"Mike was the best - the best,"
Molk said. "Hands down. Top of
the line. The best guy. The best
system. The best sell. The best
knowledge base of the people that
I talked to, and I talked to a lot of
strength coaches.... There was no
one who even compared to Mike."

Barwis' system, designed to
build lean but strong-as-a-bull
lineman, developed Molk and
Martin into "two of the strongest
players in the United States,"
according to Barwis. But when
Brady Hoke was hired in Janu-
ary 2010, Barwis was replaced by
Aaron Wellman, whom Hoke was
more comfortable with.
"The whole season was awk-
ward without (Barwis)," Molk
said. "I was so used to having him
around, so used to the voice, the
pre-game speeches, the workouts
- that was night-and-day differ-
ence. And it was weird not having
him there, because all of the ath-
letic ability everyone had going
into (the Sugar Bowl) and going
into the season was attributed to
Mike."
The difference between Well-
man and Barwis was black and
white, Molk explains.
"Mike knew it because he was
the guy who led the research,"
Molk said, notingthe strength
and conditioning journals that
have published Barwis' work.
"Wellman read the research. It
is what it is."
Molk hopes he can work out for
teams before April's NFL Draft.
He said he plans on lifting at the
Combine, and that the highest
he's ever repped in the 225-pound
bench press was 38 times - and
that was after a brutal workout.
The record is 49 reps.
"Who knows what I can do
fresh," Molk said. "Mike (Mar-
tin's) the only one who's going to
be near me."
I asked Molk if he was worried
he wouldn't be able to work out
for NFL teams and prove he's not
too short (he's listed at 6-foot-2)
to play center.
"He's got plenty of film," Bar-
wis interjected, on his way out
the door to lunch, as Van Bergen
opened up his eggs in another
room.
Watching from afar, Barwis
said he still was Molk's and
Martin's and Van Bergen's and
Watson's and Koger's biggest fan.
Those who come in contact with
him tend to stay close. Guys he
sculpted 15 years ago still come
around. And Friday morning,
before four of his sons showed
up to workout, one he trained 19
years ago called looking for family
advice.
"I'm always goingto be that
guy - I'm kind of like the dad,"
Barwis said.
"I never forget about my kids."

For the Daily
The Michigan women's gym-
nastics team left Crisler Cen-
ter on Friday night with a win
against Illinois, but that wasn't
enough to allay the bitterness
the team felt about their frus-
trating performance.
"We definitely just need to
regroup as a team, and decide,
well, we're small, but we're
strong," said freshman Sachi
Sugiyama. "We just need to get
stronger - especially mentally."
For the second week in a row,
Michigan's fate came down to
the final rotation, and yet again,
they didn't disappoint. After
struggling on beam, the 19th-
ranked Wolverines rallied on
floor to narrowly defeat the 14th-
ranked Fighting Illini, 194.225-
193.700.
There were many questions
coming into Friday's meet con-
cerning Michigan's response to
the loss of junior Natalie Beil-
stein to a season-ending ankle
injury. Many of those questions,
though, will have to wait until
the Wolverines can develop a
fail-safe performance and post a
decisive total score.
Michigan (3-0) got out to a
strong start on Friday. Impres-
sive performances by Sugiyama
and junior captain Katie Zurales
led the Wolverines to top finish-
es on vault, followed by sopho-
more Joanna Sampson, who tied
for third. Michigan then contin-
ued its success on uneven bars,
recording its best performance
of the year (49.125). With five
scores of 9.800 or higher, the
Wolverines added to their lead
thanks to the routines of sopho-

Freshman Sachi Sugiyama sustained a fall on beam but helped 'M' to victory

more Shelby Gies and freshman
Annette Miele.
"I thought Annette Miele did
a fabulous job on uneven bars
stepping in for (Beilstein)," said
Michigan coach Bev Plocki.
Miele, who made her col-
legiate debut on balance beam
against Ohio State, was one of
the athletes who Plocki has spot-
lighted in Beilstein's absence. In
her first performance on uneven
bars this season, the freshman
showed few signs of inexperi-
ence.
It was only a matter of time,
though, before the Wolverines
would face their nemesis - the
balance beam. Despite strong
performances from Sampson,
Gies and junior Brittnee Marti-
nez, Michigan posted its worst
overall score this season for the
event (47.675). After being forced
to count two disappointing falls,
the Wolverines struggled in their
third rotation, which allowed
Illinois to take the lead.
"I told the kids after beam
coming into floor, 'I hate to
always be going into the last
event needing to rally to win a
competition, but you guys have

done it well up to this point, so
let's keep it going,"' Plocki said.
Michigan's clutch perfor-
mance on the balance beam last
week helped secure their nar-
row victory in the fourth rota-
tion over Minnesota. This week,
even with the advantage of being
the home team, the Wolverines
reverted to what Plocki called
a "frustrating" performance.
Fortunately for Michigan, the
balance beam wasn't too kind
toward Illinois, either. The
Fighting Illini recorded their
own share of falls on the balance
beam, which allowed the Wol-
verines a chance to get back into
the meet.
Once again, the Wolverines
displayed their late-meet hero-
ics, led by sophomore Reema
Zakharia, who tied for the event
title on floor (9.900). Round-
ing out the quartet of Michigan
gymnasts - who all recorded
scores of 9.800 or higher - were
Sugiyama, Zurales, and Samp-
son. Michigan's strong perfor-
mance on floor proved too much
for Illinois and helped lead the
Wolverines to athird win despite
their stumbles on beam.

Wolverine midseason awards

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's basket-
ball team has successfully com-
pleted the first half of its grueling
Big Ten schedule. After posting
one of the program's best records
in history, the Wolverines (5-3
Big Ten, 16-5 overall) are looking
to secure their first NCAA tour-
nament bid since 2001. Michigan
picked up wins against Illinois,
Indiana, Minnesota, Northwest-
ern and Ohio State - the Buck-
eyes were the Wolverines' first
and only win against a ranked
team this season - and dropped
one game to in-state rival Michi-
gan State and two to Penn State,
who was ranked in both contests.
There have been a few impor-
tant factors in Michigan's first-
half success:
Offensive MVP: Junior for-
ward Rachel Sheffer has stepped
up in conference play, scoring
double digits in six of the team's
eight conference games. She's
also established a post pres-
ence that Michigan had been
searching for all season. Sheffer
has gone up against some of the
toughest, most physical forwards
in the nation and has mostly come
out with success. She can also
shoot the 3-pointer respectably -
she's 33 percent on the season -

careers, and they know that Col-
lins can lead them there.
There's no shortage of players
who want to play for the team.
The Firebirds don't recruit like a
college team, but making the team
is a competitive process. Coaches
hear about players, talk to them,
watch them play and scout them
out a little bit. It's not an easy pro-
cess.
When Luke played, the Fire-
birds' roster was mostly com-
posed of Arizona kids with the
occasional exceptions.
Today, the team hosts players
not just from around the United
States, but from Sweden and Mex-
ico as well. It's not surprising to
Waldersen, who knows the extent
of Collins' reputation as a WHL
scout across the country. But it is
a little surprising to Luke.
"Thinking about it, you'd think,
'Move away from Arizona to play
hockey,' " Luke said. "(It's) what
I did and what a lot of kids end
up doing. But now, I think, as
hockey's growing, more and more
come to play. It's a better team,
people will come in from every-
where if there's an opportunity."
There's definitely opportunity.
Though no player is ever a shoe-
in to make it to the next level of
hockey, the Firebirds see their fair
share of talent skating through
the doors of Oceanside.
When Luke started playing
for Collins, he made it his goal to
make it to the U.S. Development
Program. He was whisked off to
Ann Arbor to play for his junior
and senior years of high school -
his aspirations came true.
He thanks Collins for that.
"He's got experience, he's
played a lot, he knows about the
game," Luke said. "He's had suc-
cess. He had a junior program he
started from scratch. He's just one

of the best coaches, such a well-
respected guy that you trust his
opinions."
This year, Collins' team has
gone 13-7-2 since the regular sea-
son started in September. When
an Arizona team can play games
against teams from Michigan or
Pennsylvania and hold its own,
people notice.
And a little bit of attention is
all the team wants. It's a sport
dominated by teams from hockey
hotbeds like Michigan or Massa-
chusetts, and winning is the only
surefire way the Firebirds can set
themselves apart.
As Luke puts it, kids want to
play on teams that win.
Collins' teams win. That's how
they get respect. That's how Luke
got noticed.
Mike Lehto's job is to get
people excited about hockey.
This is coming from a man who,
after growing up in Michigan's
Upper Peninsula, had never been
exposed to basketball as a child
because hockey was all he knew.
Lehto lights up when talking
about hockey. And as the Rocky

making her a dual threat.
Defensive MVP: Junior guard
Jenny Ryan has been the bread
and butter of the Wolverines'
stellar defense this season, lead-
ing the team in rebounding and
steals. Standing at 5-foot-9, she
may not be the most intimidating
player on the court, but the inten-
sity she brings on defense is her
best quality. She's always sprint-
ing up and down the court and
vocally directing the defense. All
of her teammates agree that she is
the spark of the Michigan defense
- Sheffer said Ryan is the leader
on defense and someone who pro-
vides energy for the team.
Biggest win: The game against
Ohio State was by far Michigan's
biggest win, as it came against the
only ranked team the Wolverines
have beaten all season. Though
the Buckeyes have been a peren-
nial leader in the Big Ten, they've
dropped the last three matchups
against the Wolverines. This year,
Michiganwon inconvincingfash-
ion, upsetting their then-unde-
feated rival, 73-62. All the pieces
seemed to fit together on offense,
and the Wolverines played one
of their best games defensively.
Michigan held the Buckeyes' top
two scorers to 10-of-34 shooting,
and three Wolverines broke into
double figures.
But despite one of the best

starts in program history, the
Wolverines can't seem to break
into the top-25. To add to that,
each of the three times the team
garnered votes in the polls, it
proceeded to lose the following
week.
It may be bad luck, but if
Michigan wants national notori-
ety, it has to prove it deserves of
inclusion in the top-25. Inclusion
could come with wins against the
top teams in the Big Ten, and the
Wolverines still have a chance to
crack the top-25 if they can win a
few more key games.
Michigan State: This time,
Michigan will have home-court
advantage, but that still may not
be enough. The Wolverines will
have to put up a fight in the paint
- Michigan State has a physical
forward in Lykendra Johnson,
who dominated the paint against
the Wolverines, and a couple
other forwards who helped the
Spartans outrebound the Wol-
verines, 44-29, in their previous
game. Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth has been emphasizing
the importance of rebounding
all season, and this is a game in
which the Wolverines have to win
the battle on the boards.
At Nebraska: No matter who
you are, it's tough to win on the
road. And it's even tougher to win
on the road against a top-25 team.

If the Wolverines want to pick up
another marquee victory, they
have a chance to do it in Lincoln.
The 19th-ranked Cornhuskers
has had an up-and-down season,
barely pulling out a double-over-
time win against Northern Ari-
zona, and losing to Penn State at
home after beating them on the
road. But the Wolverines will first
have to shut down Nebraska's
three potent scorers who con-
tribute to one of the highest-scor-
ing offenses in the conference.
The entire Michigan squad will
have to channel its performance
against Ohio State in order to take
down Nebraska on the road.
Purdue: This is another game
that Michigan has the potential
to win. This is the only time the
Wolverines will face the Boil-
ermakers in the regular season,
and it happens to be their sec-
ond-to-last game. It could decide
Michigan's seed in the Big Ten
Tournament and possibly its seed
in the NCAA Tournament. Pur-
due is on top of the Big Ten right
now, and if the Wolverines win,
this game could match the sig-
nificance of the victory over Ohio
State.
Michigan will have to contain
senior Brittany Rayburn and
sophomore Courtney Moses -
something not many teams have
been able to do.

crash in from the weak side and

eight on the offensive end.
The Wolverines took a quick
5-0 lead in the opening min-
utes. After the Buckeyes quickly
answered, the scoring went back
and forth from there. A combi-
nation of solid defense and poor
shooting from both teams kept
it a low-scoring affair, as both
Michigan and Ohio State shot
under 40 percent from the field
in the half.
The Buckeyes looked to have a
serious advantage with Sullinger
establishing himself in the paint
early. But Michigan responded by
switching to a 2-3 zone out of the
second media timeout. Ohio State

would dart for the NBA. Nobody
confuses Luke for a ginger Nos-
tradamus.)
Michigan isa much differ-
ent team than last season. They
aren't dominated by freshmen
anymore. They actually have
seniors this time around. And I
certainly think this edition of the
Wolverines is better. Whereas
the loss last season put their Big
Ten record at 2-7, they're just one
game out of first place in the con-
ference at 6-3 after this one.
But Luke's words still ring
true. Fans were thrilled that
Michigan performed as well as
it did last season simply because
the performance was ahead of
schedule - the team was really
building toward the future. Next
year, some surely thought, we
won't be inexperienced. We won't
be too youngto competefor cham-
pionships.
But even though most of the
Wolverines now have a full year
under their belt, it doesn't sud-
denly make them experienced
vets. Sophomores are largely
better to have than freshmen,
but they still aren't even upper-
classmen. They're still relatively
inexperienced, and they still
have plenty to work on before
they reach their ceilings. (Maybe
this isn't true for the five-star,
McDonald's All-American types,
but Michigan doesn't have any
of those on its roster.) And the
loss to Ohio State was a reminder
that, for all the experience that
key freshmen got last season,the
players aren't as ripe as Michigan
coach John Beilein wants.
Redshirt sophomore forward
Jordan Morgan has done a much
better job of staying out of foul
trouble so far this season. But
faced with his biggest challenge
yet in Buckeye bruiser Jared Sull-
inger, he reverted to his old ways,
picking up his fourth foul early in
the second half.
It was the definition of need-
less. Tim Hardaway Jr. was
good against the Buckeyes, but
his inconsistencies elsewhere
have been well-documented.
And sophomore forward Evan

used this season. The Wolverines
kept the ball out of the paint, and
the Buckeyes usually missed any
open 3-pointers they got.
"I think you'll see that from
time to time during the year, try-
ing to change the matchups we
have," Beilein said. "We always
try to do things just to change
up, so they never get comfortable.
You let this team get comfortable,
they got too many bullets in that
gun."
Ultimately, Ohio State did get
comfortable. When the Buckeyes
extended their lead to eight points
early in the second half, Michi-
gan responded with a 7-0 run to
tighten the game once more. But
Ohio State answered with an 8-0
run of its own just before Mor-
gan's fourth foul. The Wolverines
couldn't come back after that.
And Sullinger finally came
alive late in the game to help seal
it for the Buckeyes, who found
their shootingtouch in time to put
it away late in the second half.
Smotrycz has proven my argu-
ment better than any other player
with his up-and-down perfor-
mances this season. He picked
up his fourth foul just a couple
minutes after Morgan, and like a
lot of other second-year players,
often shows upbig or completely
disappears in games. Of course,
there's also the fact that the
team's best player this year -
playing Beilein's priority position,
no less - is the least experienced
of them all. Trey Burke hasn't
often played likea freshman this
season, but he's still a rookie. For
all his skills, he has more develop-
ing to do. This isn't to say that this
year is over, and that we shouldn't
have high expectations until next
season, when all the sophomores
are juniors and Beileinbrings in
what is by far his most talented
crop of recruits.
This edition of Michigan is,
without a doubt, a good team, and
has the potential to make a pretty
deep run in the NCAA Tourna-
ment. But that doesn't mean that
we should expect all the growing
pains to go away. Losses like this
one are goingto happen because
the Wolverines still don't have all
the weapons they need.
"I think every (first) half we
play here has been (close), and
then (Ohio State) just has tremen-
dous talent," Beilein said after
the loss. "We have to hit the open
shots that we had, and we have to
finish plays at the rimto stay in
there."
Those are plays that truly
experienced, veteran teams make
without even thinking - when
Michigan can do that consis-
tently, you'll know Beilein has the
seasoned team he wants.
By the end of lastseason, the
freshmen were playing beyond
their years. And based on
Beilein's track record of teams
improving overthe course of a
season, we can expect them to
once again make significant prog-
ress before the year is over.
But before you get too frus-
trated by performances like
Sunday's, just remember: most of
the team is still young. They're
building, but construction isn't
finished just yet.

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Sophomore forward Luke Moffatt started his hockey career in Arizona before joining the USNTDP in Ann Arbor.

Mountain District coach-in-chief
for USA Hockey, he tries to evoke
those same emotions in children
from Arizona, Colorado, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and
Utah.
Coach-in-chief is what it
sounds like - overseeing all
aspects of youth hockey in Lehto's
six states, from teaching volun-
teers who have never put on a pair
of skates before how to become
capable coaches or to funneling
players through state wide and
regional clinics in hopes that
some of them will make the pres-
tigious USNTDP.
Lehto has seen a steady
increase in the number of regis-
tered hockey players in the Rocky
Mountain Dis-
trict - the
number stood
at 39,117 in the "Jt's
2010-11 year.
It seems who I a
impressive'
when you real- It'S t
ize that. Lehto
had to build a
hockey com-
munity out of virtually nothing.
But then you realize that number
is spread out between six states
- and it can't compare to the
over 54,000 registered skaters in
Michigan alone.
The spread-out nature of
Lehto's district creates logisti-
cal obstacles. Playing another
team isn't just another game - it
becomes full-fledged road trip.
And road trips start to take a toll.
In Michigan, a trip to another
team's rink could be a 30-minute
car ride. When Luke played, he
took 30-minute rides to the air-
port.
It becomes exhausting.
Luke pointed to his freshman
year of high school as an example
- he had 46 absences.
"That was bad," Luke said,
laughing. "I had to lie about going
to school all the time. I'd get doc-
tors notes from family friends.
We were only allowed to miss so
many days for our activities, (the
school) was really strict."

Traveling wasn't a big problem
for Luke. His parents made sure
his homework was always com-
pleted on time, and he was fortu-
nate enough to be able to afford
flights to Boston three times a
year.
But that's not always the case.
Lehto talked about a team with
hopes of making a trip to a nation-
al tournament. Those dreams
might have to be put on hold since
only 11 of the 22 players have the
means to afford the trip.
Traversing long distances is
inevitable for teams like the Fire-
birds, who have to take the time to
find quality teams to play against.
Families aren't the only ones
suffering from financial burden -
towns are too.
Rinks in these
communities
art of weren't built
with one every
Lm now. couple of miles
like they were
UI," in Canada.
Some rinks
in the Rocky
Mountain Dis-
trict have to operate 24 hours a
day to accommodate all the dif-
ferent programs from different
towns that need to use the ice.
Availability of ice isn't some-
thing Lehto can control. But he
does work hard to make the most
of the facilities available to him -
fillingup local rinks for 20 hours a
day isn't a small feat.
He views hockey like any other
product. It has to be something
consumers want and can get easy
access to. It has to generate excite-
ment and be able to withstand in
the long-term.
Coach-in-chief may entail
something different in the south-
west than it does in Michigan. But
Lehto thinks he's doing a pretty
good job at it.
"We have a small following, but
it's a dedicated following," he said
proudly. "Our program is as big as
any other. Can it get as big as it is
back east? It certainly could."

Sometimes Luke tries to come
up with witty responses for when
doubters ask him about the via-
bility of hockey in Arizona.
But for all the attitude he
might give to teammates or other
curious fans, he doesn't really
mind at all. In fact, his hockey
upbringing is something he's
rather proud of.
Some things, like pond hockey,
he admits that he'll never truly
know. He found a way to make
do, though.
Luke and his "neighborhood
gang" would substitute a frozen
pond for concrete and spend
hours playing roller hockey in the
cul-de-sacs near his home. The
risk of a car unexpectedly flying
around the corner was always
impending, but the kids didn't
mind. They just wanted to play.
In high school, Luke was
known as the "hockey kid," and
his pastime set him apart from
his classmates who spent all their
time playing traditional Arizona
sports like baseball or football.
He was an outlier then, but not
anymore. Michigan teammate
Chris Brown is from Texas, and
Mike Chiasson is from Nevada.
They all get it - they're all part
of the same desert club.
It's impossible for Luke to put
himself in a hypothetical situa-
tion: What if he had never lived in
Arizona? What if he had grown
up in Michigan?
He sat and racked his brain for
some sort of answer. After a few
moments of thought, he finally
came up with an answer.
"I don't wish I'd grown up in
Michigan," Luke said firmly. "I'm
glad I grew up in Arizona. I had a
wonderful experience there with
hockey. Everything has ended up
working out for me so far."
Even if it means going through
the rest of his life reassuring peo-
ple that its possible to find ice in
the desert?
"It's the same questions every
time, but it's something kind of
cool. It's part of who I am now.
It's fun. I'll answer (the question)
1,000 more times."


BIGS
From Page 1B
Redshirt sophomore center
Jordan Morgan and sophomore
forward Evan Smotrycz couldn't
match the Buckeyes' strength
down low and resorted to fouling.
Both had four fouls and had to be
spelled by lightly used reserves.
With sophomore center Jon
Horford out indefinitely with a
foot injury, Beilein had to call on
junior forward Blake McLimans
and sophomore forward Colton
Christian. Both saw their most-
ever playing time in a Big Ten
game.
"It just takes some of our flow
offensively away," Beilein said of
taking Morgan and Smotrycz out.
"Our defense actually was pretty
good during that span, but it was
our offense that hurt during that
span when we had to go to the
bench."
Offensively, the Wolverines
couldn't manage to overcome
Ohio State's frontcourt, even when
Smotrycz and Morgan were in.
Michigan was unable to cre-
ate opportunities for itself inside
the 3-point arc and could only
get points in the paint on passes

to slashing teammates and feeds
right under the basket. Pen-
etration into the lane resulted in
either a kick-out or an off-balance
shot.
Freshman point guard Trey
Burke was baffled by Ohio State
guard Aaron Craft and had toset-
tle for jump shots. He made three
3-pointers but couldn't get to the
rim at will like he's accustomed
to.
"They kind of double-teamed
me off the pick-and-roll, so it
wasn't really like I could just turn
the corner," Burke said. "Aaron
Craft wouldn't let me use the
screen. That was their game plan
- not to let me use the screen.
They had a pretty good scheme
on me."
Down the stretch, when the
Buckeyes extended their lead to
double digits, Michigan's only
hope of a comeback was to drain
its 3-pointers, which had mixed
results.
Ohio State didn't even have to
revert to fouling when the Wol-
verines tried to get inside. In fact,
Michigan had zero free throw
attempts until 2:33 was remain-
ing in the game. It was almost the
first time since the 1996-97 sea-
son that a Big Ten team was held
without a free throw.
