ONE-HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

CAMPUS CONTEXT

President slated to 
roll out strategic 

initiative on inclusion 

by spring 2016

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

University 

President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
and 
his 

administration 
have 
spent 
the 

last academic year 

working to roll out new policy 
initiatives 
regarding 
several 

campus issues — most notably 
athletics, diversity, alcohol abuse 
and Greek life. This week, The 
Michigan Daily reviews the events 
that got the ball rolling. Today, 
we consider Schlissel’s work to 
address campus diversity, namely 
through the gradual unveiling 
of his administration’s strategic 
campus plan to be released by the 

end of this year.

The overview: Diversity has 

long been a battle-tested issue 
at 
the 
University. 
Currently, 

minority 
enrollment 
lies 
at 

11.53 percent — and in recent 
years, students have continually 
lobbied the University to make 
the campus more welcoming to 
minority students, both in terms 
of social climate and admissions.

The 
changes: 
University 

President Mark Schlissel has 
worked to address the school’s 
apparent lack of diversity by 
introducing 
a 
campus-wide 

strategic plan, which he will 
unveil at the end of this school 
year (also the end of his second 
year in office). Most recently, 
this 
has 
included 
launching 

the HAIL Scholarship, which 
offers full-ride tuition for high-
achieving, low-income students. 
Initiatives through the Office of 
Student Life have also sought to 
heavily incorporate students in 
catalyzing culture shift at the 

Speakers focus on 
humanizing those 

affected by 
the crisis

University students and Ann 

Arbor residents gathered on the 
Diag on Tuesday at a vigil for 

Syrian refugees.

The 
University’s 
Muslim 

Graduate Students Association 
and 
Muslim 
Law 
Students 

Association held the vigil to 
honor Syrian refugees who lost 
their lives and those who are 
still struggling to reach a safety. 
The flood of Syrian refugees 
into Europe has sparked debate 
in recent weeks as world leaders 
struggle with how to handle the 
influx of people fleeing unrest in 
their home country.

Third-year law student Omar 

El-Halwagi, 
co-president 
of 

MLSA, said he and the president 
of MGSA decided to hold the 
vigil to call attention to issues 
impacting Muslims globally.

“There is no greater human 

rights crisis right now than 
the Syrian refugee (crisis) and 
we’re all watching it unfold,” 
El-Halwagi said. “We’ve been 
watching it unfold for years. We 
finally felt there was enough 
momentum to get something 

done.”

El-Halwagi said he hopes 

students become better informed 
on the issue so that it will be more 
likely they will take action in the 
future.

“We have the next generation 

of leaders attending this school 
and they need to be able to be 
aware of what’s going on,” he said. 
“I also think college campuses 
are really ripe for activism and 
advocacy. By being able to put on 

Dimitri Nakassis 
wins $650,000 
to pursue study 

focused on classics

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

In the fall of 1993, then-LSA 

freshman Dimitri Nakassis was 
flipping through a course pack to 
decide which classes he wanted 
to take when he stumbled upon 
two courses that piqued his 
interest: Introduction to Field 
Archeology, and Intro to Greek 
Art and Architecture.

Twenty-two 
years 
later, 

Nakassis’ research on Mycenaean 
Greek society — which represents 
the last phase of the Bronze Age 
in Ancient Greece — and the 
relationship between its nobility 
and working class earned him the 
2015 MacArthur Fellowship. He 
is one of 24 individuals to receive 
the fellowship, a stipend of 
$625,000 that is often referred to 
as the “genius grant.” This year’s 

winners also include Atlantic 
correspondent Ta Nehisi-Coates 
and playwright and actor Lin 
Manuel Miranda. 

“It’s part of a bigger project of 

trying to understand Mycenae 
society, not just by looking at the 
people in the palace and not just 
looking at the palace, but also 
by looking at what’s happening 
outside the palace,” he said. “So, 
if you wanted to understand Ann 
Arbor, you couldn’t just look at 
the University campus, right?”

Much of Nakassis’s study is 

dedicated to researching ancient 
Greek linear tablets, which are 
scripts that recorded the earliest 
form of the Greek language. The 
tablets are administrative palatial 
documents that note the events 
at the palace and the individuals 
present.

“Like a lot of students, I 

wasn’t really sure what to major 
in,” 
Nakassis 
said. 
“Initially 

my plan was to double major or 
have a double concentration in 
history or economics. I was in 
my room at Markley and I was

Study says 

emergency room 
talks could change 

risky behavior

By LYDIA MURRAY

For the Daily

The results of a recently 

released five-year trial from the 
University of Michigan Injury 

Center discovered that short 
interventions by hospital staff or 
computer programs correlated 
with decreases in underage 
alcohol consumption.

Patients ages 14-20 admitted 

to the emergency department 
were asked to report on their 
drinking 
behaviors, 
and 

researchers evaluated whether 
or not their behaviors were 
considered risky.

Those 
whom 
researchers 

found to be “risky drinkers” 

were then randomly assigned 
to receive a short intervention 
by means of a therapist or a 
computer program.

Associate 
Psychiatry 
Prof. 

Maureen Walton, one of the 
study’s lead authors, outlined the 
research metrics:

“We 
asked 
them 
three 

questions 
about 
how 
many 

drinks per week they have and 
how many days per week that 
they 
drink,

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON CAMPUS

Sanders visits alma mater

WEDNESDAY:

In Other Ivory Towers

Bernie Sanders spoke at the 

University of Chicago Insti-
tute of Politics on Monday, the 
Chicago Sun-Times reported. 
Sanders is a presidential can-
didate for the Democratic 
party.

The talk was part of the 

IOP’s Road to 2016 series, 
which consists of several 
events relating to the upcom-
ing presidential election and 
offering equal opportunities 
for all presidential candidates 
to speak.

In his speech, Sanders 

encouraged the students to be 
active members of their com-
munity.

“Change never takes place 

from the top down,” he said. 

“We need the idealism and the 
energy and the intelligence 
of millions of young people 
to join us in the fight to make 
America the kind of country 
we know it must become.”

Sanders was well received 

by the students in Hyde Park, 
where he received his under-
graduate degree in 1964.

“(Sanders) was electrify-

ing,” said University of Chica-
go freshman Jacob Johnson. 

Mental health services

Silvio Weisner, director of 

George Washington Univer-
sity’s Mental Health Services, 

was forced to step down last 
week after it was discovered 
he is not a licensed psycholo-
gist in Washington D.C., the 
GW Hatchet reported.

After discovering his lack 

of credentials, Peter Konw-
erski, dean of student affairs, 
said administrators respond-
ed swiftly.

“Immediate 
action 
was 

taken to ensure compliance,” 
Konwerski said. 

According to the District 

of Columbia Department of 
Health, Weisner’s license to 
practice in D.C. is awaiting 
reinstatement, though he is 
licensed to practice in Vir-
ginia.

Roundtables 

planned to discuss 

revisions to 

misconduct policy

BY JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

At Tuesday’s Central Stu-

dent 
Government 
meeting, 

CSG President Cooper Charl-
ton, an LSA senior, announced 
initiatives to work with stu-
dents on the issue of sexual 
assault.

Charlton said CSG will host 

roundtables with students on 
sexual assault prevention and 
to gather feedback on proposed 
changes to the sexual miscon-
duct policy in the next two 
months. 

Dates for the roundtables 

are Oct. 1, Oct. 26 and Nov. 3. 

“This 
is 
something 
we 

should all be fighting for, and 
I encourage you to show up,” 
Charlton said.

Charlton also requested that 

CSG allocate $3,800 in funds 
to bring a production of The 

Haze to campus. The play is an 
autobiographical one-woman 
show by San Francisco resi-
dent Heather Marlowe about 
untested rape kits.

“There are over 400,000 

rape victims in the United 
States whose rape kits have 
gone ignored at the hands of 
local law enforcement agen-
cies,” Charlton said. “Heather’s 
purpose and her objective is to 
use theater and performance 
to bring this issue to the fore-
front.”

Charlton said several stu-

dents reached out to him about 
bringing the play to campus, 
and he thought the perfor-
mance would spread aware-
ness of the issue to students at 
a minor cost to CSG.

Budget amendments

CSG voted on and approved 

the Fall 2015 budget with a 
few amendments, including a 
2-percent increase in the bud-
get for the Student Organiza-
tion Funding Committee.

LSA senior Kevin Ziegler, 

CSG treasurer, said the finan-
cial committee reduced both 
operations and payroll by 1 per-

cent to raise SOFC’s funding to 
$200,000, constituting half of 
CSG’s Fall 2015 budget. SOFC 
is the CSG committee charged 
with allocating funding to stu-
dent organizations. 

Ziegler said it is CSG’s duty 

to make sure the student fees 
that make up the budget are 
spent responsibly.

“Not only just spending 

money, but establishing pro-
grams that benefit students 
for years to come — keeping 
that in mind in spending our 
money,” Ziegler said.

Ziegler also discussed how 

CSG can properly use its money 
to avoid funds being left over 
after the budget period are 
allocated for ends. In Fall 2014, 
there was $34,000 left over 
in unused capital from CSG’s 
commission discretionary and 
legislative discretionary funds.

Ziegler said this could be 

avoided by this year by the 
assembly if they properly apply 
for and utilize the money set 
aside for them.

“All leaders on campus can 

use the CSG funds in different 
ways,” Ziegler said.

CSG talks sexual assault 
awareness, finalizes budget

Professor discusses 
important issues, 
helps pre-meds for 
future interviews 

BY SANJAY REDDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Tuesday afternoon, 30 stu-

dents convened in the Student 
Activities Center to consider 
ethical questions in medicine.

Hosted by the Career Cen-

ter, the long-running event was 
originally designed to introduce 
undergraduate pre-medical stu-
dents to the ethical issues phy-
sicians face on a daily basis. The 
program also provides critical 
exposure to the kinds of ethi-
cal questions posed in medical 
school admission interviews.

The event featured a presen-

tation by Emergency Medicine 
Prof. Andrew Barnosky, who 
has led the session since its 

inception. Barnosky stressed 
the importance of exposing stu-
dents to medical ethics issues 
early on in their careers.

“(It) allows them to gain 

some degree of orientation and 
familiarity with issues that 
will become of growing impor-
tance as they advance in their 
careers,” he said.

During the presentation, Bar-

nosky discussed ethical issues 
currently generating intense 
debate in the medical field, 
including 
physician-assisted 

suicide, abortion and stem cell 
research and physician profit 
motives.

Barnosky put these topics 

into the context of a medical 
school interview, explaining to 
students how best to approach 
controversial 
questions. 
He 

emphasized that there’s no one 
correct answer to these ethical 
dilemmas: No matter what you 
answer, he said, doctors need to 
convey to the interviewers that 
you will put patient interests 

above your own and promote 
fair treatment for all patients.

A Q&A session followed the 

talk. Students in the audience 
volunteered to read controver-
sial medical ethics questions 
aloud and share their likely 
response if they were faced 
with the situation in the field.

University 
alum 
Andrea 

Berkemeier, who said she is 
applying to medical school dur-
ing the 2016 application cycle, 
said she found the event useful.

“I felt that the question-

answer session at the end was 
very helpful,” Berkemeier said. 
“It was framed in a very posi-
tive, constructive way.”

Berkemeier added that, as a 

pre-med student, opportunities 
to work with these issues are 
hard to find.

“As a pre-medical student 

you don’t necessarily have the 
opportunity to address and 
think about these questions 
until you are preparing for 
medical school interviews,” she 
said.

something like this, we’re really 
able to engage with the student 
body.”

Public Health student Amaal 

Haimout, president of MGSA, said 
she was inspired to collaborate 
with El-Halwagi after one of her 

friends told her that 200 refugee 
families were relocating to Grand 
Rapids.

“Now, it’s definitely a personal 

issue because it’s a car ride away,” 
Haimout said.

Haimout said many University 

students are unaware of the 
crisis, and the vigil aimed to draw 
attention to the cause.

“I don’t want to generalize, 

but there are a lot of privileged 
students here,” she said. “I 
thought it’d be a great way to 
empower those who are relocating 
to Michigan to go out of their way 
to help those who need help.”

LSA senior Dana Basha and 

Muslim 
chaplain 
Mohammed 

Tayssir spoke at the event. Both 
are of Syrian descent and both 
have family members who fled 

the turmoil in Syria.

Basha urged students to see the 

situation not as a set of statistics, 
but as difficult circustances facing 
human beings.

“I 
refuse 
to 
make 
this 

something that’s characterized 
by numbers,” Basha said. “These 
are human beings that have been 
facing atrocities and torture the 
human mind cannot fathom.”

Medical 
School 
student 

Mariam Salman echoed Basha’s 
desire to humanize those affected 
by the situation in Syria.

“It is really easy to just forget 

that they are people with their 
own families and their own 
backgrounds and memories and 
loved ones,” she said. “They have 
lives and dreams that have been 
shattered.”

An association of more than 

60 
research 
universities 
in 

the United States and Canada, 
the 
nonprofit 
AAU 
focuses 

on policy studies and federal-
government relations in areas 
such as research policy and 
research funding. For example, 
the AAU released the results 
last week from a national survey 
designed to study sexual assault 
on college campuses. 

The University was one of the 

AAU’s founding members when 
the association formed in 1900.

“No one better understands 

the challenges and opportunities 
facing higher education than 
Mary Sue Coleman,” University 
President Mark Schlissel wrote 
in a statement released Tuesday 
afternoon. “I deeply appreciate 
her willingness to take on this 
crucial role for our nation, and 
I look forward to continuing to 
work with her.”

Coleman 
served 
as 
the 

University’s 
13th 
president 

until her retirement in 2014. 
She’s no stranger to the national 
stage when it comes to higher 
education policy. During her 
tenure at the University, she 
served as AAU chair from 2011 
to 2012 and was appointed 
to 
co-chair 
the 
Obama 

administration’s 
National 

Advisory Council on Innovation 
and 
Entrepreneurship. 
A 

biochemist 
by 
training, 

Coleman was also selected last 
fall to serve on the board of the 
Mayo Clinic. 

According to Barry Toiv, 

the AAU vice president for 
public affairs, the position will 
be based in Washington D.C. 
Toiv said the AAU president 
frequently interacts with the 
presidents and chancellors of 
AAU member institutions and 
organizes 
their 
twice-yearly 

meetings in Washington D.C. 

“The 
day-to-day 
job 
is 

mainly about coordinating and 
participating in the work of 
the AAU staff, which focuses 
on advocating with Congress, 
the 
Administration, 
and 
the 

public on such issues as support 
for federally funded research, 
federal research policy, support 
for federal student aid programs, 
and higher education policy,” 
Toiv wrote in an e-mail interview.

Toiv 
said 
the 
AAU 
is 

not 
releasing 
details 
about 

Coleman’s compensation for the 
new position at this time.

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D—

Dearborn) 
applauded

Department 
of Theatre and 
Drama marks 
centennial 

The University was the first 

U.S. university to offer theater 
production classes for credit in 
1915. The Department of Theatre 
and Drama is now celebrating its 
100th anniversary, as well as 125 
years of offering acting classes 
for credit.

In celebration of the centennial, 

StarKid, a successful group of 
writers, 
directors, 
designers, 

actors 
and 
directors, 
formed 

at the University in 2009, will 
perform a reunion concert during 
Homecoming on October 8.

The festivities will continue 

with 
alumni-hosted 
career 

sessions featuring Tony-winning 
Broadway director Jack O’Brien.

Student 
performances 
of 

University 
alum 
and 
famed 

playwright Arthur Miller’s “All 
My Sons” will run Oct. 8 to Oct. 
18 at the Arthur Miller Theatre 
at the School of Music Theatre & 
Dance’s Walgreen Drama Center.

University. An example of this 
recent inclusion was engaging 
students in discussion regarding 
the best place to relocate the 
Trotter Multicultural Center.

The context: Entering into 

his first year as president of the 
University, Schlissel was quick 
to prioritize addressing the issue 
of diversity and inclusion on 
campus. Doing so was a pillar of 
his inaugural address on Sept. 7 of 
last year.

“The University of Michigan 

must be a diverse and democratic 
community: open and accessible,” 
Schlissel said. “As members of 
this community we will always 
seek out, encourage and value all 
voices.”

***

One year before Schlissel’s 

arrival, the Black Student Union 
launched its #BBUM movement 
on Twitter. The “Being Black 
at the University of Michigan” 
hashtag, which Black students 
used to share their experiences on 
campus, went viral and sparked 
similar social media reactions on 
other college campuses.

Two months later, on Martin 

Luther King Jr. Day in 2014, 
the BSU held protests on the 
steps of Hill Auditorium, where 
they listed seven demands they 
wanted the University address in 
seven days.

The 
BSU 
asked 
for 
an 

increased 
budget, 
affordable 

housing 
on 
central 
campus, 

for the Trotter Multicultural 
Center to be moved to Central 
Campus, a Race and Ethnicity 
class requirement, emergency 
scholarships, exposure of Bentley 
Historical Library documents 
on race at the University and 10 
Black enrollment.

In a January interview on 

the anniversary of the #BBUM 
protests, 
then-Engineering 

senior Robert Greenfield — who 
was BSU’s treasurer at the time — 
said the movement’s momentum 
had slowed significantly.

“University 
administration 

is made of the highest and best 
servants of our University, and 
the BSU is very appreciative of 
how they have collaborated with 
us,” he said. “However, as of 
now, it is the overall sentiment 
of the BSU that progress is not 
being made, and as an executive 
board, we’re questioning the 
administration’s 
willingness 

due to how fast things are 
progressing.”

***

Arguably, 
the 
#BBUM 

campaign played a pivotal role in 
amplifying the discussion about 
campus 
diversity, 
providing 

momentum 
for 
change 
that 

continued to roll forward as 
Schlissel took office.

In September 2014 — just 

weeks 
into 
Schlissel’s 
first 

semester at the University — 
with #BBUM and subsequent 
conversations in recent memory, 
the 
administration 
issued 

a 
“Diversity, 
Equality 
and 

Inclusion Report” report with 
13 recommendations for how to 
increase diversity on campus and 
improve campus climate.

The 
recommendations, 

generated by a committee through 
the Office of the Provost, included 
the creation of a committee to 
research the level of inclusion 
among faculty members, a plan to 
partner with schools to increase 
minority enrollment, a public 
campaign by the provost in 
support of diversity and a call for 
the creation of the “strategic plan 
for diversity.”

In a September 2015 interview 

with the Daily, Schlissel said the 
fully developed plan will likely be 
released by the end of this school 
year. The final result will come 
from the collective feedback 
of individual evaluations from 
each of the University’s schools 
and colleges as well as from each 
administrative office.

Last 
February, 
Schlissel 

announced several enterprises in 
the works focusing on diversity 
and inclusion on campus — many 
of which were recommended 
by University Provost Martha 
Pollack’s 
committee 
in 

September. 
These 
included 

partnering with predominantly 
underrepresented 
school 

districts, 
creating 
a 
task 

force dedicated to hiring and 
promoting minority staff as well 
as a diversity summit to take 
place in the fall.

“The plan has to work towards 

the goal of making the University 
community look like the public it 
serves,” Schlissel said in February. 
“It sounds simplistic: There aren’t 
numerical quotas — that’s not 
either legal or desirable — there’s 
a shared ambition and we’re trying 
to release the creativity of all of our 
different units.”

February’s 
announcement 

marked 
the 
plan’s 
formal 

introduction. Seven months later, 
its formal deadline was set; less 
than seven months from now will 
mark the beginning of strategy 
implementation that will likely 
influence climate, culture and 
general practices for years to 
come.

“It’s not the kind of thing I’m 

convinced where we have a three-
year plan and then we’re done,” 
Schlissel said in September. “I 
am convinced that my successors 
are going to be working on this 
because of how far society has 
to go to be truly inclusive and 
diverse society; the kind that 
matches our ideals.”

***

The first leg of Schlissel’s plan 

launched Sept. 2 when Schlissel 
announced the High Achieving 
Involved Leader Scholarship.

The scholarship program is 

currently being piloted for two 
years by the University with 
aims to attract academically 
strong students from low-income 
families — applying to students 
from urban, rural or suburban 
neighborhoods. 
The 
program 

offers four years of free tuition 
to the University, and is valued at 
$60,000.

“As a public university, we 

want to make sure that we 
remain accessible and affordable 
to talented students in the state,” 
Schlissel said. “No matter where 
they are in the state, no matter 
what community they grow up 
in, what high school they went to, 
what their parents do, what their 
circumstances are.”

The University has yet to 

release the demographics of 
the 6,269 students in the 2015 
freshman 
class. 
However, 

enrollment 
data 
from 
2015 

shows 3.84 percent of the newly 
admitted student body was Black. 
This brings the total percentage 
of Black students enrolled at 
the University to 4.63 percent 
— slightly lower than in the 
previous five years.

In his September interview 

with the Daily, Schlissel said the 
University would “start to see 
modest incremental changes in 
the direction of diversity now,” 
based on changes made to the 
admissions and financial aid 
procedures in the last year.

Prior to Schlissel’s arrival, 

the administration had put in 
place the Center for Educational 
Outreach, which came out of 
a 
2007 
Diversity 
Blueprints 

Committee. The CEO offers more 
than a dozen programs aimed to 
both increase the University’s 
presence 
in 
underserved 

communities and offer academic 
aid to those students.

The 
center 
aided 
4,558 

students in 2014 from third 
grade through high school in 124 
schools in the state of Michigan. 
Schlissel’s proposed plans to 
increase 
partnerships 
with 

underrepresented schools is a 
start to solving the low minority 
enrollment numbers, as there 
currently is no concrete data 
on how well similar programs 
already in place — such as the 
CEO program — affect minority 
enrollment. 

***

So far, of the seven demands 

the BSU laid out for the University 
to address, four have been 
addressed. The administration 
has nearly doubled the BSU’s 
funding — from $37,000 in 
2014 to $60,000 this year. BSU 
members have been encouraged 
by some of the administration’s 
efforts in areas such as providing 
emergency funds to students, as 
well as the revising the Race and 
Ethnicity requirements so that 
Intergroup Relations courses will 
count toward it.

However, 
BSU 
members 

say there is more to be done 
— especially in areas such as 
increasing minority enrollment 
and moving the Trotter Center 
closer to campus.

In 
response 
to 
#BBUM, 

Pollack promised in January 2014 
to improve the building. At the 
time, Pollack and Harper listed 
the Trotter Center’s relocation 
among their top three priorities 
to be addressed immediately. 
The other two were improving 
campus climate and increasing 
minority enrollment.

The University has agreed 

to ultimately move the Trotter 
Center closer to campus. The 
Office of Student Life hosted a 
number of student focus groups at 
the current location in September 
to discuss four potential options.

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president for student life, said 
in a September interview with 
the Daily that wherever the 
new location may be, it will be 
finished by 2017.

***

LSA senior Arnold Reed, the 

2014-2015 BSU speaker, said 
though the BSU has not worked 
very closely with Schlissel, the 
organization has been pleased 
with the administration’s efforts 
thus far and is looking forward 
to increased collaboration in the 
future.

“The 
gap 
between 

administration and students is 
narrowing over time, which I’m 
appreciative of,” Reed said. “I 
hope to continue working with 
them in years to come.”

Robert Sellers, vice provost for 

equity, inclusion and academic 
affairs, said, overall, students 
are 
happy 
with 
the 
steps 

Schlissel has taken over the past 
year. Sellers served as chair of 
Pollack’s committee on diversity 
and inclusion.

“The number of students 

that I talk to have been excited 
about where we are and where 
we’re going,” Sellers said. “The 
fact that he has been very public 
and upfront with regards to this 
being an important part of his 
presidency. Also the fact that 
he has laid forth a diversity 
strategic planning process that 
will engage the entire University 
towards thinking about and 
developing and recommitting 
to a strategy that will not only 
create a more diverse campus, 
but one that’s equitable for all 
students, faculty and staff and 
allow us to utilize the various 
kinds of experiences that a 
diverse campus brings.”

A priority for Sellers and 

Schlissel 
is 
to 
improve 
the 

Diversity Matters website as 
a place for students to share 
experiences and foster discussion 
online. They hope the new version 
of the website will help connect 
students with pre-existing online 
resources while also creating new 

platforms for interaction.

Moving forward: Reed said he 

was happy Schlissel has a plan, 
but said he cannot be sure of how 
much of an impact it will make at 
this point.

“A plan is a great place to start, 

but a plan is definitely just a plan 
until action is put behind it,” 
Reed said. “I’m going to be very 
interested to see how that action 
is put behind it and how students 
are going to be playing a role in 
that narrative. I think that it’s a 
good thing for him to be talking 
about it and rallying behind it, but 
I just want to see what becomes 
of it in the years to come. We’re 
definitely holding administration 
to that plan.”

Something everyone seems 

to agree upon is that diversity 
issues cannot be solved within 
one year’s time. Sellers is pleased 
with how much Schlissel has 
accomplished 
over 
the 
past 

year as well as his approach 
to 
addressing 
diversity. 
He 

said while Schlissel can lead 
the efforts to improve campus 
diversity, it’s up to members of 
the University community to put 
an effort into creating change.

“It’s important for folks to 

understand that he has made 
a great deal of progress in the 
eight months, in terms of his 
commitment, both publicly and 
privately, more so than one could 
even begin to imagine,” Sellers 
said. “He has a serious view of 
this, so he doesn’t see this as a box 
to check off his checklist in terms 
of issues to address, but he sees it 
as a long-term commitment.”

Sellers continued highlighting 

the importance of Schlissel’s 
long-term outlook.

“That long-term commitment 

means that it’s not going to be 
solved in a semester. The issues 
that face this University, or 
frankly face higher education 
in our society, cannot be fixed 
in a semester,” Sellers said. “I 
would, quite frankly, be afraid if 
that was his approach. That just 
tells me that he’s serious about 
it because he sees this as a long-
term effort that the University as 
a whole must engage in to have 
real transformation, and to have 
real, sustained achievement.”

Reed also noted the ongoing 

process of promoting diversity as 
well as his confidence in Schlissel 
to take on the job.

“There’s 
things 
that 
we 

can always improve. This is 
something that you can’t just 
work on once — it’s a continual 
process,” Reed said. “I’m excited 
to see what comes of it. He’s still 
pretty new at this point and he’s 
growing into his role. I’m just 
really excited to see where he 
can take these issues. He’s a very 
strategic thinker and he’s very 
methodical in his movements, 
and I think that we’ll be able to 
see a lot of cool things being done 
this upcoming year.”

flipping through the course 
catalog. Archeology wasn’t ever 
something that I had thought 
of as something I could study at 
the University. I mean, I knew 
archeology was a field, but it 
never occurred to me to major in 
classical archeology.”

Nakassis, who went on to 

major in classical archeology 
when he was a student, also 
took classes in ancient Greek. 
Doing so catered to both honing 
his 
academic 
interests 
and 

reconnecting with his family 
roots — his father grew up in 
Greece, where, he said, learning 
the ancient language was part of 
the high school curriculum.

“They were just the best 

classes. They were so well taught 
and so interesting and I was 
pretty much hooked after that,” 
Nakassis said. “From there, I had 
a very, very clear idea of what I 
wanted to do … It was just sort 
of luck of the draw, having really 
great and inspiring professors.”

One 
of 
his 
influential 

professors during his time at 
the University, Nakassis said, 
was Susan Alcock, who was a 
MacArthur recipient in 2000.

“It feels weird to think of 

myself or to be in the same 
category with someone like 
her,” he said. “That’s the other 
weird thing about winning the 
MacArthur. So much attention is 
on you and part of me just wants 
to be like, ‘I’ve only been able to 
get here because I’ve had, like, 
the best professors.’ I really feel 
like, at Michigan, I was exposed 
to some of the best professors in 
the field.”

The University is currently 

the only college in the state with 
a classics department. Michigan 
State University’s final classics 
major graduated in May 2014.

“I think it is an unfortunate 

reality of the financial crunch 
that 
a 
lot 
of 
universities 

are 
feeling,” 
Nakassis 
said. 

“Michigan’s a shining light, for 
sure, in classics … it would be 
better for the people at Michigan 
if it weren’t the only one.”

and we asked them about binge 
drinking, which for youth is five 
or more drinks in one occasion,” 
she said. “Just based on the 
responses to those questions, we 
determine what’s risky drinking.”

The results of the trial were 

overwhelmingly positive, as both 
outlets of intervention proved 
effective in reducing alcohol 
consumption 
and 
drinking-

related consequences.

Particularly 
promising 

was the effectiveness of the 
computer program, which was 
significantly able to reduce the 
frequency 
of 
alcohol-related 

injuries. According to the study, 
a brief computer intervention 
correlated with a decrease in the 
instances of driving under the 
influence in the 12-month follow-
up period.

“The idea that technology 

can be used to deliver health 
interventions, 
not 
just 
for 

alcohol as it can be used for other 
behaviors as well, is an exciting 
way to address health behaviors 
in a low-cost way,” Walton said.

Medical 
School 
student 

Stephan 
Diljak, 
co-president 

of 
the 
University’s 
chapter 

of 
the 
American 
Medical 

Student Association, said the 
potential of increasing the role 
of technology in mitigating 
behavior is a “cool idea.”

“It seems to me that it sounds 

very similar to methods that 
have been proven to work to 
get people to quit smoking,” 
he said. “This sort of thing has 
more of an effect than family or 
friends on getting people to quit. 
I definitely believe that it could 
be a valuable way to get people 
to change their behavior for the 
better of their health.”

The results of the trial are 

promising, but there is still a long 
road ahead before any policy can 
be implemented, including the 
need for repetition of the trial.

“I 
don’t 
think 
it 
will 

immediately change practice,” 
Walton said. “I think changing 
practice in clinical care takes time. 
One of the limitations of the study 
is that it was conducted in a single 
emergency department setting 
and before you would implement 
this as part of clinical care we 
would like to see it replicated.”

Walton and her team are also 

currently applying for funding 
to attempt to replicate their 
findings in eight emergency 

departments across the country.

Medical School student Shai 

Madjar said broadening the 
study’s scope could potentially 
change the delivery of health 
interventions in the long run.

“From a medical point of view, 

I think that it’s really hard to 
change people’s behavior — even 
risky behavior,” he said. “In the 
hospital, you often have so little 
time talk to people, so if you can 
show that a brief intervention 
like the ones discussed in the 
trial can have an impact that 
stays true over time that would 
be really important.”

This ability for a computer 

intervention to have such a 
significant effect on behavior 
could have long-term effects 
on how patients and doctors 
interact. 
Walton 
added 
that 

the medical community will 
undoubtedly continue to look into 
ways to curb underage drinking 
— an issue the University has also 
grappled with in recent years.

“I think there’s a real interest 

in medical studies, including 
the emergency department, in 
reducing injury and alcohol is a key 
risk factor in injury and therefore 
I think that a lot of hospital 
personnel are very committed to 
this issue,” Walton said.

I 
 

realized that I no longer belonged to the 
church as I made my way up to the altar, 
arms crossed tightly across my chest. I 

glanced nervously around, 
noticing some heads turned 
and stares directed my way. 
I imagined a door straight 
to Hell itself opening the second my feet 
touched the front of the church, but was met 
instead by a kind, smiling priest who laid his 
hand on my shoulder to give me a thoughtful 
blessing. On the way back, I didn’t even notice 
the eyes that were glued to my back.

Religion is not my thing. And this past 

April, I attended mass for the first time in 
quite a long time. Although Catholic, I have 
admittedly lacked a presence at church for 
the last nine years — unless, of course, you 
count watching “The Ten Commandments” 
on ABC every Easter.

In 2013, the daily news revolved around 

the reelection of a new pope. I watched as 
my deeply religious high school friends raved 
and frequently asked, “Who are they going to 
choose to lead the Church?” as if a “Dancing 
with the Stars” finale was approaching. Most 
days, after listening intently until I became 
lost, I went back to my turkey sandwich, 
uninterested and not willing to spark up yet 
another debate about religion.

At the time, I considered myself a “bad 

Catholic” for not being present at church on 
Sundays and for believing in things not con-
doned by the Church. Soon, I began to identi-
fy as a “nonaffiliate” and saw all church-goers 
as that one guy who stands at the corner with 
a megaphone screaming that we must all 
repent our sins or risk winding up in Hell.

I lost touch with religion because it was 

easy — easier than trying to explain that I was 
a “Catholic that is totally OK with (insert) and 
(insert) and (insert).” I never looked back too 
much on religion and began to enjoy my church-
free, cartoon-filled Sunday mornings. That is, 
until recently, when I heard that Pope Francis 
would make a historic visit to the United States.

I tried to think back — Who was Pope 

Francis? All I had heard about our new pope 
over the past two years was that he was quite 
progressive. Not horribly, but enough to make 
me turn my eyes to the head of a Church I had 
all but abandoned.

So, I decided to find the answers to my 

questions. Along the way, my friend forwarded 
me an article from CatholicVote.org, which 
immediately caught my attention. It focused 
on the pope’s papal visit to bless AIDS victims 
and, because the most at-risk groups are 
homosexuals, I was preparing myself to find 
a harsh response in the text. What I read was 
surprisingly open and heartfelt, especially 
since it was coming from what my mind 
viewed as the most conservative person on 
the globe.

“God loves you all, without distinction, 

without limit,” he said. “He loves those of 
you who are sick, those who are suffering 
from AIDS and AIDS-Related Complex … He 
loves all with an unconditional and everlast-
ing love.”

The pope’s further comments continued to 

provide support and blessing for all who have 
suffered greatly, welcoming those individuals 
into the heart of the Church.

I could feel my illusion of the Church 

cracking and shattering from its very foun-

hoever is responsible for 
the phrase “no press is 
bad press” couldn’t have 

foreseen 
the 

flurry of news 
stories, 
social 

media posts and 
general nonsense 
that has swirled 
around 
Greek 

life 
at 
the 

University these 
past few months. 
Fraternities and 
sororities 
have 

been 
told 
by 

administration 
that they’re partly responsible for 
a devaluation of degrees, resulting 
from Michigan’s “party culture.” 
Similar comments made by Dean 
of Students Laura Blake Jones 
referenced 
a 
“work-hard, 
play-

hard mentality” and “downward 
spiral.” Suffice it to say the Greek 
life community has been taking a 
beating for the past few rounds and 
needs to get off the ropes. With the 
Mud Bowl, they might just have 
their opportunity.

For the past eight decades, the 

gentlemen of Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
have preserved this tradition on their 
front lawn, combining muck, adren-
aline and the sheer beauty that is 
two-hand touch football. To put this 
into perspective, the original Mud 
Bowl game was played in 1933, when 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was in his 
first year as president and World War 
II was just peeking over the horizon. 
Since then, the contest has become 
a staple of Greek life, as fraternities 
vie each year in a tournament for 
the privilege of playing SAE. The 
game, usually held during homecom-
ing weekend, has raised more than 
$100,000 for Mott Children’s Hospi-
tal in the last five years alone.

However, this year is different. 

The SAE chapter has been operat-
ing off campus for four years now, 
following their suspension in 2011 
due to allegations of hazing, and this 
summer had its charter revoked by 
the national organization. Combined 
with the administration’s recently 
tense attitude toward Greek life, the 
responses to this year’s game have 
been unusual and complicated. Devin 

Berghorst, an assistant director of the 
Office of Greek Life, has discussed 
sanctions for fraternities seeking to 
enter this year’s tournament, based 
on the Interfraternity Council’s poli-
cy against attending events hosted by 
non-sanctioned groups. The Univer-
sity hasn’t outright forbidden frater-
nities from entering the tournament, 
but instead threatens punishment for 
participation. This is unprecedented, 
considering the guarantee in the IFC 
constitution of self-governance.

I would like to stop for a minute 

and recognize the fact that I am, in 
fact, a GDI*, unaffiliated with any fra-
ternity and by no means an authority 
on the inner workings of the IFC or 
the event. However, I am a third-par-
ty observer with the added bonus of 
freedom from bias and agenda.

That being said, with all the 

diplomacy and finesse of a dump 
truck, the choice of the administra-
tion to insert itself into this conflict 
is emblematic of the misguided, 
short-sighted nature of the new 
campaign to corral Greek life. The 
University’s approach is reminiscent 
of a substitute teacher attempting to 
settle down a horde of rowdy school-
children. The Mud Bowl exemplifies 
some of the best aspects of Greek 
life — charity, a deep love for tradi-
tion and the ability for a community 
to come together for a common goal 
(thousands of dollars to a children’s 
hospital). So why pick this fight? 
Students have entered as individu-
als, completely unaffiliated with 
their fraternities and national orga-
nizations, yet the University’s overly 
watchful eye remains.

The University should disabuse 

itself of the notion that attempts 
like this, meant to preserve order, 
will do any more good than unnec-
essarily provoking and victimizing 
nearly 20 percent of the under-
graduate population. Party culture 
and Greek life are not synonymous; 
speaking as someone who isn’t in a 
fraternity, I can guarantee that if 
that fifth of the population were all 
to drop out tomorrow, there would 
still be parties at Michigan. Stu-
dents would still tailgate on Satur-
days and underage drinking would 
continue to occur. Events like the 
Mud Bowl exemplify the organiza-

tion and responsibility that Greeks 
often bring to this sometimes 
overly criticized “party culture.” 
Despite 
concerns 
about 
safety 

from the Office of Greek Life, for-
mer SAE president Brett Mizzi has 
confirmed that students have hired 
security, purchased event insur-
ance and formulated risk manage-
ment plans for the 2015 Mud Bowl.

Philanthropic organizations such 

as the Juvenile Diabetes Research 
Foundation, Service for Sight and 
Camp Kesem are consistent ben-
eficiaries of the efforts of college 
students who will be playing and 
spectating at Mudbowl LXXXII. 
On-campus groups such as Dance 
Marathon field several teams every 
year from Greek life. Their con-
tributions to the community are 
immense, but what kind of message 
does the University administration 
send when it lets such a staunch 
position against Greek life stop stu-
dents from doing something as light-
hearted and altruistic as the annual 
Mud Bowl game?

If September’s events are any 

indication, the relationship between 
University administration and the 
Greek life community this aca-
demic year will be nothing short of 
ridiculous. Only the University and 
administrators like Berghorst can 
steer clear of this.

How? 
Treat 
fraternities 
and 

sororities with respect, instead of 
like misbehaving children. Accept 
that the work-hard-play-hard men-
tality is something that draws a 
lot of highly motivated students to 
apply to the University in the first 
place. Be willing to recognize the 
positive contribution that commu-
nity makes to our school.

Is Greek life perfect? Absolutely 

not. But the Mud Bowl is about 
healthy tradition, raising money for 
charity and a group of college guys 
pushing each other around in the 
mud. It’s fun, it serves a cause and 
it’s relatively innocent.

So can we please start treating it 

that way?

L

ast fall, I enrolled in Classic Civiliza-
tion 101 to fulfill my first-year writing 
requirement, knowing full well that 

it would require a heavy 
workload of both read-
ing and writing. Drafting 
papers was still somewhat 
new to me, especially ones 
built around such specific 
topics or given prompts, 
like those I knew I would 
encounter in this class.

In order to tackle the 

challenge 
of 
first-draft 

composition, 
I 
started 

by getting out a stack of 
notecards and writing my 
way through lists of bullet points. But even 
with those cards set out in front of me, the 
white page of my word processor stubbornly 
refused to fill with text. So instead of staring 
at the screen, I armed myself with a mechani-
cal pencil and one of my well-worn yellow 
legal pads, decided how many pages I needed 
to fill to meet my word-count goal and got 
started scribbling words.

When workshopping the early drafts of our 

papers in class, I mentioned that my neatly 
typed pages of text had started out as hand-
writing, and drew incredulous stares from my 
peers. None of them had written their papers 
by hand, and all took a moment to think about 
how that might work. We were writing fairly 
long papers, aiming for 1,600 words — about 
eight double-spaced pages, which, for me, 
meant seven or eight pages, handwritten. In 
filling those pages, much of what I wrote was 
mediocre, and the content wasn’t incredibly 
cohesive, but I got something down to meet 
my word- and page-count goals.

It was in transcribing those 1,600 words 

that something changed. In so closely going 
back over what I had written, I gave myself a 
chance to edit while still in a stage of initial 
composition. Instead of trying to find connec-
tions between my ideas, the material and how 
to transcribe them, I was putting down a lot 
of raw material and watching with satisfac-
tion as it filled up the pages of my blank piece 
of paper. By not starting on the computer, I 
came back to what I had written with a more 
organized idea of where I wanted the writing 
to take me, and now I had a quantity of text 
already written, from which I could begin to 
more thoroughly develop my ideas.

As a matter of fact, we use different 

neurological pathways when we write out 
words by hand versus when we type — so I’ve 
been told by fellow writers, and as has been 
confirmed by a variety of studies, including 
a 2012 study conducted by researchers 
Karin James and Laura Engelhardt at 
Indiana 
University. 
Through 
imaging 

children’s brains, the researchers found that 
handwriting activates different regions than 
typing, and with greater overall stimulus. 
The study also addressed the variety found 
in handwriting, and how, when writing on 
paper, creative and personal expression can 
come into play. Everyone’s handwriting, even 
their styles of shaping letters, are incredibly 
diverse. It’s by practicing shaping those letters 
that children can come to better understand 
what each one means.

Compositions on paper can also be eas-

ier to navigate than ones on the computer; 
there’s complete freedom to write notes in 
margins, box off parts of a page, or to circle, 
underline or highlight passages of text. And 
then there’s the content that’s generated — 
not just an abstract, virtual document made 
of megabytes, but something more solid and 
real. Even while in the process of composing 
words, the time it takes to write them out and 
later to type them up allows a deeper reflec-
tion on the ideas being presented, as well as 
on the composition and cadence of sentences.

While it may seem like a daunting task to 

write a paper longhand before a single word 
makes it into your blank document, I believe 
it saves time in the long run. Writing a com-
position before typing it grants space that’s 
needed for ideas to sink in and form more 
fully. Having a break between modes also 
leaves breathing space for an author to see his 
or her text with fresh eyes, and to more easily 
pinpoint spelling errors, grammar mistakes 
and breaks in continuity. While keyboards 
must play a role at some point — and while 
I only deem my papers complete after care-
ful refinement on the computer — typing on 
the computer isn’t the only way to transcribe 
a first draft or to do writing that’s academic 
and serious in nature.

Even these words, though they have under-

gone changes after I transcribed them onto 
a screen, were drafted first by hand. And in 
future writing exercises, I fully intend to 
continue using a mix of analog and digital 
in generating and refining my ideas. Though 
it may require I invest more time in the pro-
cess, I know the effort I put in will result in 
me building a more complete understanding 
of the ideas I’m ultimately trying to put forth. 
Besides, who needs to spend all those hours 
staring at a computer screen when a pad of 
paper is so much easier on the eyes? This 
fall, I plan to once again fill my yellow legal 
pads with ideas written out in hasty graph-
ite scratches, knowing with full confidence 
that I’ll be able to turn those scribbles into 
polished, word-processed text by the time my 
paper’s due.

dations. Was all that I had thought 
about religion for the past couple 
years a lie? A new pope, one who 
could see the entire community, 
demonstrated an inclusiveness that 
the Church was always supposed 
to 
provide. 
Contemplating 
this 

big question, I returned from the 
excerpt only to find the shocking 
revelation that this description was 
not of Pope Francis, but Pope John 
Paul II. In the 1980s.

People think they understand 

what the Catholic Church is teach-
ing, but when we see something we 
disagree with, it’s easier to back 
away than try to understand and 
search for answers. The Church 
is inclusive, and the pope embod-
ies the unity of a congregation of 
people, all different yet viewed 
the same in the eyes of God. I had 
judged an entire religion based on 
my experience in one small church, 
in one small town; I had based my 
thoughts about the inclusion of all 

different kinds of people on matters 
I thought all Catholics believed in. I 
didn’t want to be a part of a church 
that seemed to close its doors to the 
differences found in all people.

In my search for answers and 

clarification, 
I 
found 
beautiful 

words and acts of kindness from 
Pope Francis himself during his trip 
to our country, most of which were 
not so different from those before 
him. Sure, Pope Francis might have 
what the the author Stephen White 
affectionately 
states 
a 
“family 

resemblance” to his predecessors, 
yet he takes on his teachings with 
an off-the-cuff air of lighthearted-
ness filled with wisdom and humor. 
After arriving on American soil for 
the first time, he stopped to bless a 
young boy with cerebral palsy. And 
while reinforcing the virtues of 
family, he added in a light “I won’t 
speak of mother-in-laws” riff before 
launching into the teaching, captur-
ing both attention and laughter. 

I believe, though, that Pope 

Francis will gain a recent and large 
following not only through his 
compassionate and inclusive nature, 
but also through his ability to inspire 
people to dream higher and live 
the lives we were meant to live. His 
teachings and words of wisdom can 
apply to all people, whether devoutly 
religious, completely nonreligious, 
simply on a break from church 
or anywhere in between. If wise 
and compassionate words are ever 
needed, look to to Pope Francis and 
his desire to motivate and give hope 
to every person on this planet.

“Sure, 
a 
person 
sometimes 

dreams of things that are never 
going to happen,” Francis said in a 
recent speech in Cuba. “But dream 
them. Desire them. Open yourselves 
to great things.”

Nothing new in dull 
‘Grinder’ premiere

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

In “The Grinder,” Rob Lowe 

(“Parks and Recreation”) stars 
as 
Dean Sanderson, 
a 

fictional tele-
vision 
actor 

known 
for 

his role as a 
dashing law-
yer 
on 
the 

eponymous 
show-within-
a show.

At 
the 

beginning 
of 

the 
episode, 

Dean watches 
the 
series finale with his 

brother Stewart (Fred Savage, 
“The 
Wonder 
Years”), 
his 

brother’s family and his father 
Dean Sr. (William Devane, “24”). 
 

Brother Stewart works as a real-
life attorney in their suburban 
hometown with his wife Debbie 
(Mary Elizabeth Ellis, “New Girl”) 
and their two kids. When Dean 
shows up, Stewart begins to feel 
like a secondary character in his 
own life, thanks to Dean’s fame 
and success acting as Stewart’s 
real-life job. 

While 
struggling 
with 
an 

eviction 
case, 
however, 
the 

endlessly charismatic Dean helps 
Stewart by deciding to become a 
real lawyer.

This plan is met with obvious 

skepticism by his brother Stewart, 
who is reasonably offended by how 
cavalier Dean acts about pursuing 
a career as a lawyer. Unfortunately 

for the show’s credibility, Dean’s 
decision is met with enthusiasm 
from everyone except Stewart.

The concept of “The Grinder” 

sets it miles apart from the cookie-
cutter 
comedies 
and 
sitcoms 

plaguing fall pilots, and the show 
has the potential to be both biting 
satire and trippy meta-humor 
in the future. However, the first 
episode doesn’t quite deliver the 
funny insight into fact versus 
fiction promised by its premise. 
Along with its responsibility, the 
show must also deliver a solid, 
albeit 
somewhat 
conventional, 

family 
comedy 
with 
great 

chemistry 
between 
its 
leads 

and some well-placed jabs at 
Hollywood legal dramas.

Neither Savage nor Lowe fall 

into the trap of being the unfunny 
straight man. The consequence, 

however, is that the series doesn’t 
use 
its 
talented 
supporting 

cast. The notable exception is 
newcomer Colin Kalopsis who 
plays Stewart’s 13-year-old son 
Ethan. Kalopsis is given some of 
the best lines in the show, and it 
wouldn’t be surprising if we’ll be 
seeing a lot more of him in the 
future. On the other hand, Ellis’s 
role as Debbie is relegated to the 
stereotypical wife-character — 
ironic, given the show’s aims at 
exposing television clichés, and a 
shame given Ellis’s talent.

Rarely does a show’s pilot 

reveal exactly what its makers 
have up their sleeves, and it’s 
likely that the pilot of “The 
Grinder,” though an entertaining 
half hour of comedy, has yet to 
show the true potential of what 
the series can be.

TV REVIEW
Evolution of A2 
craft breweries

Ann Arbor 

breweries thrive 
since mid-’90s 

By KAREN HUA

Daily TV/New Media Editor

It was a Thirsty Thursday.
I headed deeper downtown, 

against a campus crowd flow-
ing the opposite direction for 
the night. East Washington 
became submerged in a golden 
sunset, hues of amber and red 
from pale to dark.

Arbor Brewing Company’s 

monthly beer-tasting event had 
a “Michigan-made” theme that 
night. Ochre ambiance and a 
hearty aroma greeted me at 
the door. I shuffled between 
two dozen varieties all brewed 
in-state, from porters to pales 
to “Peanut Butter Chocolate 
Stout.” I mingled among retired 
men 
indulging 
flavor 
from 

mason jars with the utmost 
precision — a drastic difference 
from conventional University 
drinking culture.

According to the Brewers 

Association, Michigan alone 
produced more than 825,000 
barrels of craft beer last year 
across 159 craft breweries — a 
quantity that’s nearly quadru-
pled over just the past decade. 
During the recession in 2008, 
while the cost of germinated 
barley soared 25-to-40 percent 
and hops prices tripled, craft 
beer production continued to 
rise steadily in the state.

A 
historically 
German 

immigration town, Ann Arbor 
opened its first commercial 
brewery in 1838, during a cen-
tury when the U.S. brewery 
count was at an all-time high 
of about 4,100. The numbers 
majorly dipped during Prohibi-
tion and the Great Depression, 
but by current day, we have 
almost recovered the histori-
cally high counts — just shy of 
3,500 at the end of 2014.

Though beer was nationally 

re-legalized in 1933, no compa-
ny brewed commercially in Ann 
Arbor for 46 years following the 
end of prohibition until Matt 
and Rene Greff opened Arbor 
Brewing Company in the sum-
mer of 1995, with Grizzly Peak 
emerging three weeks later, two 
blocks down.

An 
influx 
of 
short-lived 

brewery 
openings 
cluttered 

the mid ’90s, led by a series of 
closes and financial struggles 
that made locals wonder if craft 
brew would just be a fad. How-
ever, those that prevailed are 
some of the most successful 
businesses today. Jon Carlson 
and partners would go on to 
invest in the local development 
firm 
Mission 
Management, 

which is responsible for suc-
cessful Ann Arbor breweries 
like Grizzly Peak, Blue Tractor 
and Jolly Pumpkin.

David Bardallis has docu-

mented the city’s entire brew-
ing history in his book, “Ann 
Arbor Beer: A Hoppy History of 
Tree Town Brewing,” published 
in 2013. He graduated from the 
University’s 
Dearborn 
cam-

pus in ’94; as he came of legal 
drinking age, the craft beer 
boom took off. He is now a home 
brewer and connoisseur of local 
product — the man even has the 
word “bar” in his name.

Rene and Matt Greff wrote 

the 
foreword 
to 
Bardallis’s 

book, and they have hosted a 
beer-tasting series every month 
since 1997.

“It’s partly flavor, it’s partly 

quality — but I think even more 
importantly is the local aspect: 
Being engaged with and know-
ing the people who make your 
beer. There’s a whole commu-
nity feel,” Rene said.

A veteran in the brewing 

industry now, she believes pas-
sion for beer can stem from 
college. By partnering with a 
University graduate from India, 
the Greffs recently began oper-
ations on their first overseas 
brewery in Bangalore.

In the following two weeks, 

I worked my way backward in 
time, filling in the details from 
management firms to Peanut 

Butter Stout. To my surprise, 
Jolly Pumpkin’s history extends 
only six years, but the roots of 
its owners intertwine deeply.

Maggie Long, managing part-

ner and executive chef at Jolly 
Pumpkin Café and Brewery on 
South Main, was raised around 
Detroit 
and 
completed 
her 

graduate degree at the Univer-
sity. The restaurant’s old-world 
tropical décor transported us to 
a colonial South America.

Before we started, she inter-

jected, “Hold on, I just gotta 
text my six farmers back.”

Her commitment to local-

ness doesn’t just stop with food. 
Jolly Pumpkin’s liquor license 
only allows them to distrib-
ute to themselves, so they sell 
exactly what they brew in Dex-
ter, Mich.

Long began as executive chef 

at Grizzly Peak, where she met 
Ron Jeffries — head brewer at 
the time — a University gradu-
ate and local brewing legend. 
In 2004, Jeffries started the 
first Jolly Pumpkin in Dexter, 
where he became one of the 
first people in the country to 
brew sour beers. Long’s desire 
to make a local impact followed 
him there.

“Six years ago, sours were 

still on the obscure end, so we 
wanted to make this a really 
comfortable, 
approachable 

place,” Long said.

Now, Jolly Pumpkin is most 

known for their two entry-
level sours, Bam Biére and Bam 
Noir. Long strove to make their 
beers as versatile as possible, 
suitable to pair with anything 
on the menu, eliminating the 
need for expertise. In doing so, 
she has encouraged a humble 
community of drinkers, not 
exclusive or pretentious with 
ale epistemology.

“Beer’s such a great world, 

especially in Ann Arbor. Every-
body kind of does different 
things, so they all have their 
own niches,” Long said. “If 
somebody doesn’t like one style, 
they can go somewhere else and 
have another style.”

Jolly Pumpkin is now a 

70,000-square-foot facility for 
brewing and bottling. Back dur-
ing first year of business, its Oro 
de Calabaza golden beer won a 
Gold Medal at the Great Ameri-
can Beer Festival. The company 
has won national and interna-
tional accolades almost every 
year since, including the most 
recent at the seventh annual 
Hong Kong International Beer 
Awards, where they took home 
more first-place prizes than any 
other brewery.

Later in the week, I headed 

over to Blue Tractor BBQ & 
Brewery, which also only brews 
and sells on the premises. Steve 
Barnes, formerly general man-
ager of Grizzly Peak, moved 
over to manage Blue Tractor 
three years ago. An Ann Arbor 
native, he echoed Long’s senti-
ments about Jeffries.

“There are chefs and there 

are cooks. The cooks just take 

the recipes and put it together 
and here it is. But the chef 
creates something new,” he 
says. “Whereas Ron, he was sort 
of like a chef-brewer. He could 
create new things and start 
things from scratch and have 
these ideas and they turned out 
great.”

Barnes then led me right 

around the corner, simply a wall 
separating what we just drank 
from what was currently being 
produced. From a sweaty sauna 
to a refrigerator-cold room, he 
detailed the complex procedure 
of the two-week process from 
grain to glass.

“I give (my head brewer) free 

reign to do whatever he wants 
to do,” Barnes says. “That’s 
what I did with Ron. Not 
everything works, but that’s 
how you learn.”

Later that day, down the 

street, Grizzly Peak Brewing 
Company reflected the same 
sentiment — a fearlessness to 
push the envelope and make 
mistakes with brewing.

“Beer has been able to sus-

tain itself through any of the 
fads because of the fact that 
people started doing new and 
interesting things, as opposed 

to the same lager over and over 
again,” said Stacy Baird, Griz-
zly Peak’s general manager.

Baird was hired only six 

months 
ago, but 
she 
has 

already revamped the menu 
and modernized the space to 
invite younger, chicer custom-
ers into her usual mix.

Both she and Duncan Wil-

liams, the head brewer, were 
born and raised in southeast-

ern Michigan. Williams came 
under Jeffries as an assistant 
in 2001, but took over as head 
brewer when Jeffries left to 
open Jolly Pumpkin.

On his job, the brewpub 

and the entire Ann Arbor 
craft brewing scene, Williams 
explained, “It’s a mixture of 
innovation and tradition.”

For rookies or the adventur-

ous, Grizzly Peak offers a sampler 
of five-ounce selections of beers, 
sorted from lightest to darkest, 
or less hoppy to more hoppy, to 
encourage drinkers to try new 
items side by side.

Just as Baird and Barnes are 

relatively new faces of manage-
ment in the industry, new faces 
arrive from around the world in 
Ann Arbor each fall. Just as Baird 
and Barnes are willing to try 
new things with brewing, more 
millennials are also willing to 
expand their palates to appreci-
ate quality brews.

“A lot of younger people are a 

big part of the reason (the craft 
brewing industry is so success-
ful). The millennials and the 
like are fuelling a lot of that. If it 
wasn’t for them, it couldn’t sus-
tain itself.” Baird said.

Ultimately, all four brewing 

companies share the same goal 
of growing appreciation for their 
craft and their product — not only 
to the University’s college crowd, 

but to the entire city of Ann Arbor.

“The community just gives us 

the ability to bring more people 
into the area, and because we’re 
so close in proximity, they don’t 
have to walk far. We gently feed 
off each other,” Long said.

“There’s been this amazing 

camaraderie right from the very 
time we opened,” Rene said. “We 
know that we’re competitors, but 
we feel like there’s enough busi-
ness to go around, and we’re real-
ly more like all in this together.”

Long added, “The explosion 

of the brewery in the area and 
throughout the state has cre-
ated jobs outside of brewing, like 

hop farms. So when you create 
the demand on a relatively small 
scale, there are offshoots that 
come of it.”

Long’s sentiment has basis in 

fact, as Michigan’s craft brewing 
businesses contributed almost 
$1.9 billion to the U.S. economy 
last year — 3.4 percent of the $55.7 
billion contributed by craft brew-
eries nationally. National brewer-
ies have also created more than 
424,000 jobs related to breweries 
and brewpubs.

From two breweries down the 

street two decades ago to three 
brewpubs and nine microbrewer-
ies to date, it’s clear the craft-brew 

boom is infectious.

Over on the east side of town, 

down Packard Street, Pointless 
Brewery & Theatre is set to open 
next year, which will serve impro-
visational theater with in-house 
brews. This spring, more than 
500 people raised almost $53,000 
on Kickstarter for the new busi-
ness, proving the local dedication 
to craft brewing.

On the other side of town on 

West Liberty Street, Glasshouse 
Brewing is just set to open its 
doors later this summer. The Pay-
eur family hones their focus 
on what will strictly be a brew 
house and beer bar.

Homeopathic meds 
for a hypochondriac

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

There 
are 
few 
things 
I 

loathe more than my sinuses. 
As unpredictable as Michigan 
weather and as capricious as 
my spending habits, my nasal 
chambers are likewise among my 
tragic flaws — that along with being 
the offspring of a hypochondriac 
and a practicing physician (read: 
I’m a de facto over-informed 
nervous wreck when it comes to 
all things disease).

When the congestion struck 

last week, I shied away from my 
rote scanning of WebMD’s symp-
tom checker and turned to the 
Daily Arts desk for medicinal 
advice — yeah, I was that desper-
ate. Among the run-of-the-mill 
suggestions of my counterparts 
(“Get lots of rest! Drink flu-
ids! Call your mom!”), a voice of 
homeopathic reason surfaced.

This ally of a Senior Arts 

Editrix 
seemed 
under 
an 

uncharacteristically 
maternal 

trance as she spent a full eight 
minutes focused on my impending 
wellness 
trajectory. 
 
She 

recommended I visit the People’s 
Food Co-op in Kerrytown — the 
alleged Ann Arbor health oasis. 
She jotted down her homeopathic 
musings and fully ignored my 
skepticism. She rattled off various 
herbal supplements, micro and 
macrobiotic 
rich 
foods, 
and 

teas she swore by. She rapidly 
questioned my health history 
and eating habits as I pondered 
her lack of a medical degree. She 
applauded my consumption of 

ginger and seaweed salads, but she 
shuddered at my gluten and dairy-
laden diet with a rhetorical health 
ultimatum, only to inquire, “Do 
you want to get better?”

I let her ramble and listen 

to herself for a hot second, 
but 
then, 
unsuspectingly, 

something about her outlook 
appealed to me. Though I often 
approach my illnesses with a 
routine pragmatism — doctor, 
prescription, repeat — I was 
tempted to abandon my trusted 
methods. In my head, my fleeting 
teenage status seemed sufficient 
rationale. And yet, the more 
I listened to her blasphemy, 
the more tokens of wisdom I 
vowed to cash out at the co-op. 
This 
alternative 
means 
of 

healing had its own brand of 
practicality. Turning to nature 
made sense, and though I had 
no intentions of acclimating to 
a full-on Emersonian lifestyle, 
an unrefined, non-commercial 
means of healing seemed a more 
feasible rebellion than getting 
tatted up. And besides, I trusted 
her strong jawline — a result of 
admirable discipline and devotion 
to facial yoga.

So to be spontaneous and 

carefree in the hopes of it 
radiating some allure, I did the 
characteristically uncharacteristic 
thing: I decided not to pick up my 
prescriptions and rather follow the 
advice of my temporary healer.

Toting my list of all things 

natural, I approached the co-op 
threshold with a slight hesitation, 
but then I kept hearing those 
words: “Do you want to get better? 

Do you want to get better? Do you 
want to get better, Caroline?”

Though I suspected the market 

to be a combination of hole-in-
the-wall fruit stands and spice 
emporiums, 
I 
was 
pleasantly 

surprised by its normalcy — a 
standard grocery store layout and 
an above average produce selection 
with the enticing additions of a hot 
food bar and adjunct café. Sure, I 
was taken aback at the organic cat 
food, but the remaining selection 
was positively intriguing.

It was an easy feat as I perused 

the aisles, finding my editor-
endorsed products in a matter 
of minutes. As I strolled home, 
still resonating with the voice 
of perpetual doubt in my head, 
I silently swore not to gauge my 
health progress for at least a week.

Within days, I saw the light, the 

one I assumed mentally obstructed 
my Editrix and others whom 
I’d assumed fell victim to that 
naturalistic shit … sorry, phooey. 
As I popped supplements of 
concentrated garlic, brewed green 
tea around the clock, simmered 
and sipped miso soup, munched 
on nori and irrigated my nasal 
passages as necessary, my sinuses 
cleared along with my mind. Less 
than a week into my homeopathic 
practices, I was left with nothing 
more than a lingering sniffle.

Though I won’t advise skipping 

a doctor’s appointment in times 
of 
serious 
somatic 
setbacks, 

for seasonal bouts of colds and 
coughs, I’ll continue to trust my 
off-beat Editrix and head to the 
People’s Food Co-op when I want 
to get better.

TV REVIEW
‘Grandfathered’ 
ages John Stamos

Little potential for 
FOX comedy past 

its premise

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

“Grandfathered” might be a sin-

gle-camera comedy on FOX, but it 
has the feel of a CBS sitcom with-
out 
the 

live studio 
audience. 
There 
are broad 
jokes occa-
sionally 
based 
on 

race 
and 

sex, 
with 

simplistic characterizations and 
saccharine 
bonding 
moments. 

Based on the series premiere, it’s 
difficult to tell whether the show 
will go the way of “How I Met Your 
Mother” or “The McCarthys.” 
There are some promising ele-
ments, like the focus on family and 
age, but it’s also hard to see where 
the show can go past its pilot.

John Stamos (“Full House”) 

stars as Jimmy Martino, a restau-
rant owner who discovers that 
his ex-wife Sara (Paget Brewster, 
“Criminal Minds”) had a child 
years ago and never told him. Her 
son, Gerald (Josh Peck, “Drake and 
Josh”), visits Jimmy at work and 
introduces him to his own daugh-
ter. Not only is Jimmy suddenly a 
father, but he’s a grandfather.

The pilot proceeds exactly as 

you’d expect. Jimmy’s world is 
rocked by the sudden realization 
that he has a family. He’s reluctant 

to get involved until he spends 
time with them, and then decid-
ing to dedicate himself to his new 
family. His actions are completely 
predictable — from Jimmy’s initial 
hesitation to his eventual change 
of heart — but it’s cute in a fluffy 
heartwarming sitcom way. There’s 
nothing really complex about it, but 
it’s reliable for an “awww” or two.

Though the show has some 

charming moments, it’s low on 
laughs. The cast attempts nobly 
to succed in remedying this, espe-
cially Brewster, who showed her 
comedic chops on the last season 
of “Community” earlier this year. 
Her delivery is sharp, and her 
lines are reliably funny, like when 
she mentions that she accidentally 
burned her baby with a seatbelt 
and “I swear, he looked right at me 
and gave me the finger.” Stamos, to 
his credit, commits himself entire-
ly to the role of Jimmy, playing his 
character as if Robert Downey Jr.’s 
Tony Stark was suddenly given a 
new family. Stamos is suave, con-
fident and vain, but the nuances 
in the writing just aren’t there 
beyond Jimmy’s predictable heart 
of gold. He’s like Barney Stinson of 
“How I Met Your Mother” without 
any of the fun character quirks.

The rest of the cast is similarly 

underdeveloped. Peck plays Ger-
ald as an overeager man-child, 
thrilled to finally meet his dad and 

receive relationship advice from 
him, but any shades of resentment 
he might have are toned down in 
favor of their immediate bond-
ing. Christina Milian (“Baggage 
Claim”) plays blank slate Van-
essa, the mother of Gerald’s baby 
and the woman he hopes will be 
more than a friend. Kelly Jenrette 
(“Frisky Dingo”) and Ravi Patel 
(“Past Life”) play two employees 
at Jimmy’s restaurant who most-
ly just exist to make jokes about 
Jimmy as a womanizer, though 
there’s a fun aside where Jenrette’s 
character makes friends with Sara.

Most of the jokes in “Grand-

fathered” fail to elicit more than 
a vague smile, and every charac-
ter’s role can be summed up in 
a sentence or less. Arguably the 
most important flaw to address, 
though, is how “Grandfathered” 
can continue past its pilot. Will 
it be possible to sustain a whole 
series of television based on its 
simple premise? Will the show find 
a comfortable groove as a hangout 
comedy like “New Girl,” or will it 
fall back on obvious subplots like 
a re-coupling of Jimmy and Sara? 
With its cast and its heart, “Grand-
fathered” could join the other 
high-concept sitcoms whose audi-
ences have grown over the years. 
The real question is whether view-
ers will be willing to watch past 
the uninspired first episode.

FOX
New doc shines light 
on Black Panthers

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

“The Black Panthers: Van-

guard 
of 
the 
Revolution,” 

directed by Stanley Nelson, is 
the first fea-
ture-length 
documentary 
to 
tell 
the 

Black Panther 
Party’s story 
from 
begin-

ning to end. It 
is mesmeriz-
ing the entire 
way through, 
not 
only 

painting 
a 

three-dimen-
sional picture 
of the Party, but lending itself to 
comparisons to the present day 
without once explicitly calling 
“today” into focus.

Nelson never inserts his voice 

into “The Black Panthers”; for-
mer and current Panthers speak 
for themselves, as do journal-
ists, FBI informants and police 
officers who were involved. 
Each tells his or her own side of 

a story — stories that are often 
neglected, forgotten or white-
washed in tellings of the Civil 
Rights Movement today. “The 
Black Panthers” deconstructs 
the popular conception of the 
Party 
as 
the 
trigger-happy 

radical alternative to civil dis-
obedience, and it paints a vivid 
portrait of the Party’s charis-
matic leaders.

The documentary also covers 

much more than the timeline 
of events that led to the Party’s 
eventual split, capturing how 
the 
Black 
Panthers 
shocked 

and fascinated the nation. He 
devotes a significant amount of 
time to how the Black Panthers 
represented a different kind 
of pride, a new kind of fashion 
iconography and an obvious 
sex appeal that attracted young 
people. Former Panthers talk 
about how the majority of the 
Party was in their late teens and 
early twenties, and the youthful 
vibrancy radiated when they 
marched down the street. Some 
who joined later on discussed 
how the Panthers represented a 
new kind of image that they could 
aspire to as younger children.

It’s unfortunate that the 

chauvinist sexist aspects of the 
Party, while addressed, only 
take up a few of the 116 minutes 
in the documentary. However, 
the strength and resilience of 
the many black women in the 
Panther Party break through. 
Women describe answering the 
phones with one hand while 
bouncing their crying children 
in the other or asking to carry 
guns along with the men. One 
describes how a woman volun-
teered to be the first person to 
walk out of a house unarmed, 
waving a white flag in the mid-
dle of a bloody shootout with 
police officers.

Overall, 
the 
documentary 

deserved a better ending, artisti-
cally and technically. It ends with 
a “where are they now” epilogue, 
focusing on only some of the Pan-
ther’s more famous leaders, end-
ing the dynamic story on a softer 
note. This concluding tactic also 
fails to add the element of cohe-
sion to tie it all together. While 

this is unfortunate, it doesn’t 
detract too much from the over-
all work.

A documentary is only ever as 

good as its story, and this story is 
electric. It’s impossible to avert 
one’s eyes from the stunning 
black-and-white 
photographs 

and the video footage, grainy as 
they may be.

This story is one of anguish 

and heartbreak, of a collective 
response and rally in the face of 
police brutality and societal pres-
sure to back off and back down. 
It is a story of the passion for 
change found in youth, but also of 
the dangers faced by movements 
that become too big too quickly. 
It is a story of hope and relentless 
refusal to give up the fight for jus-
tice, quiet victories and bloody 
defeats and unapologetic pride. 
In short, it’s a similar story, more 
or less, of the Black Lives Matter 
movement today.

Nelson chooses not to make 

any explicit comparisons to the 
civil rights struggle that occurs 
today, but the comparisons are 
blindingly obvious. They repre-
sent a different kind of pride in 
being black in the face of bigotry 
and hatred, heard loud and clear 
in their chant “Black is Beauti-
ful.” Across social media, trends 
like the #melanin tag and orga-
nized events like #Blackout have 
taken off, especially on photo-
friendly platforms like Twitter 
and Instagram. There are pho-
tographs of the Panthers stand-
ing in the middle of the street 
handing out their newspaper to 
people in cars, subtly highlight-
ing the group’s recognition of 
the media’s impact. This makes 
for another comparison with the 
Black Lives Matter movement, 
which largely stems from social 
media. Perhaps most obviously, 
one of the focuses of the Pan-
thers was police brutality, an 
issue that has become a focal 
one in the movement today. Nel-
son’s unflinching gaze at police 
brutality stripped bare doesn’t 
feel understated or overem-
phasized; it just feels like the 
truth. It feels familiar. This may 
be why the documentary hits 
home — it reflects it.

Haidar enjoying breakout senior season

Even when she 

comes off the bench, 

Haidar makes an 

impact for Michigan

By BETELHEM ASHAME 

Daily Sports Writer

With five minutes left on the 

game clock, nerves began to run 
high on the sideline and in the 
crowd. The score was deadlocked 
at 0-0, and time was running out 
for the Michigan women’s soccer 
team.

The Wolverines had dominated 

the game against Iowa, controlling 
possession 
and 
dictating 
the 

run of play on their way to 
manufacturing the majority of 
the scoring opportunities in the 
match. They held a 12-1 advantage 
in corner kicks and produced 27 
shots while allowing just three, but 
the potential for victory seemed to 
be drifting further and further out 
of reach as the game clock wound 
down to four minutes, then three 
minutes, then two.

Michigan threw players into the 

attack. Senior defender Christina 
Murillo scrambled down the left 
flank, dribbling through scores of 
defenders, and launched a cross 
into the middle of the box filled 
with Wolverines and Hawkeyes 
awaiting the delivery, either to 
slam the ball in the direction of 
the goal or punt it far away from 
the penalty box.

All the eyes in the U-M Soccer 

Stadium looked up, and one head 
soared above the rest. Michigan 
senior 
forward 
Lulu 
Haidar 

buried the ball in the back of the 
net, unleashing the home crowd 
and team into a joyous frenzy. 
It was the 88th minute, and 
Michigan finally found its game-
winner. And its hero.

Though an underrated player 

on the team, Haidar has the ability 
to take control of a game and 

impact the final score, according 
to Michigan coach Greg Ryan.

“Lulu is the kind of kid that’s 

very confident when she gets 
around the goal,” Ryan said. 
“She’s not tall by any means, but 
she has great timing, she reads 
the flight well, and she can head 
the ball better than most of our 
players. The confidence she has 
in the attacking part of her game 
helps her keep at it and keep going, 
knowing if she gets that chance, 
she’s going to score.”

But that climactic finish only 

tells part of the story of a player 
who knows how to make the most 
of her opportunities.

To start the season, Haidar 

has tallied five goals and one 
assist while playing in eight of 10 
matches and starting just three. 
The results haven’t always come in 

the past — Haidar has more goals 
than in her first three seasons 
combined — but now she’s a spark 
plug whenever she enters the 
game.

“Lulu’s one of the best soccer 

players on our team in terms of her 
attacking ability,” Ryan said. “She’s 
got great skill, she can shoot from 
anywhere and has a very powerful 
shot, and she sees the field well 
and is able to make great passes to 
give her other teammates chances 
to score, so she’s got all the great 
qualities of an attacking player.”

Her position on the team as a 

non-starter but a key role player 
affords her the opportunity to 
come into a game and dramatically 
affect the outcome.

Part of the explanation for her 

strong start may be related to her 
summer job. Haidar spent the 

summer playing on Motor City 
FC – a Women’s Professional 
Soccer League 
U-20 
team. 

There, 
her 

team captured 
the 
league 

championship, 
and 
she 

won 
Golden 

Boot 
and 

Tournament 
MVP awards.

“It 
was 

a 
great 

experience for me, and it had a great 
effect on me as of now,” Haidar 
said. “It was a good opportunity to 
play other teams and to challenge 
myself as a player, and it helped me 
stay in the game and stay in shape 
in addition to working out and 
practicing on my own.”

Ryan 
believes 
that 
her 

productive offseason is paying 

dividends 
both for her 
and for the 
team 
as 
a 

whole.

“Just 
like 

Christina 
Murillo 
playing 
for 

Mexico in the 
World 
Cup, 

when 
your 

kids play at 

a high level over the summer, it 
helps tremendously because they 
come back already ready to go,” 
Ryan said. “I think Lulu came back 
in great shape because she played 
a lot, so she was really ready to put 
her best foot forward, and she has. 
Some of our players that didn’t 

play much this summer, it has 
showed in their ability to impact 
the team.”

Sharing Ryan’s belief, Murillo 

thinks the team has responded 
well to the example Haidar has set 
in the early stages of the season.

“It’s really amazing to see a 

player like Lulu who’s not always 
starting but who goes into the 
game and makes a difference,” 
Murillo said. “That’s inspired 
other players to think ‘I’m getting 
90 minutes, so I need to be making 
more of a difference in the game.’ ”

Making 
the 
most 
of 
her 

opportunities, Haidar serves as 
a reminder of the importance of 
each member of a team through 
her perseverance, dedication and 
passion for the game. For a senior’s 
final hurrah, she’s making quite a 
statement.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Senior forward Lulu Haidar has tallied five goals and one assist in Michigan’s first 10 games this season. Haidar has made the impact despite starting just three of the Wolverines’ games.

“She’s got all of 

the great qualities 

of an attacking 

player.”

Johnson again looking to 
rebound from ACL tear

The running back 
did not allow time 
for sadness during 

his recovery

By MAX BULTMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

Drake Johnson gave himself 

one hour for pity.

The day he found out he 

had torn his anterior cruciate 
ligament for the second time, 
Michigan’s 
then-redshirt 

sophomore running back needed 
to get his feelings out. He drove 
around, listening to Boyz II Men 
and Mariah Carey, wallowing in 
the raw emotion of being told he 
had reinjured his ACL. But just 
for an hour.

“After 
that 

… I had to get 
back,” Johnson 
said. “I couldn’t 
have 
any 

more negative 
emotions if I 
wanted to play 
(again), so it 
was like, ‘It’s 
time 
to 
get 

going.’ ”

Johnson, who grew up in Ann 

Arbor and came to Michigan 
from Pioneer High School, made 
immense strides at the end of the 
2014 season. He rushed for 122 
yards and two touchdowns in a 
breakout game against Indiana, 
and by the time the Ohio State 
game rolled around, he was 
verging on being the go-to back.

But in the third quarter 

against the Buckeyes, Johnson 
injured his knee as he scored a 
touchdown. He didn’t return 
to the game, and it was later 
revealed he had torn the same 
ACL he had injured his redshirt 
freshman season, in 2013.

It could have been a devastating 

blow to his confidence and to his 
career. But Johnson didn’t let his 
second torn ACL keep him down 

long.

Today, 
Johnson 
exudes 

optimism even when talking 
about one of the most difficult 
injuries 
an 

athlete 
can 

face. He worked 
himself 
back 

to 
health 
in 

time for camp, 
a 
nine-month 

process for the 
same 
injury 

that took him 
six the first time around.

“I was in a wheelchair for a few 

weeks,” Johnson said. “Luckily it 
was over winter break, so I kind 
of, like, wheel-chaired around 
my house. I got really bored, so I 
tried to do tricks on it, do wheelies 
on it and stuff, entertain myself. I 
got really good, actually.”

After 

getting 
out 
of 
the 

wheelchair, 
Johnson 
began 
the 

rehab process 
and expected 
to be ready for 
full contact by 
the first day 
of fall camp. 
But 
when 

he saw the speed at which his 
teammates were playing, he 
realized he wouldn’t be able to 
jump back in as quickly as he 
initially wanted.

And when he finally got the 

green light to return in August, 
he had to play catch-up to an 
even deeper stable of running 
backs 
than 
the 
Wolverines 

had last season. But according 
to Johnson, there hasn’t been 
any envy or hostility between 
him, redshirt junior De’Veon 
Smith, junior Derrick Green and 
redshirt sophomore Ty Isaac.

Instead, 
he 
says 
the 

competition has helped the backs 
learn from each other.

“I watch De’Veon, I watch 

Derrick and Ty all practice, 
and they do good things. They 

do dope things,” Johnson said. 
“You’re like, ‘Wow, that was 
dope.’ They make cuts, they make 
blocks, they make all these plays 

and 
you’re 

like, ‘I should 
do that!’

“That’s 

the kind of 
environment 
we have. I’ll 
pop off a long 
run, and I’ll 
look back, and 

they’ll be like, ‘Hey Drake, how’d 
you do that?’ Or, I’ll come back 
and I’ll watch them pop off a long 
run: ‘Hey, how’d you do that?’ ”

And so far, that growth is 

showing on the field. Through 
four 
games, 
Michigan 
is 

averaging 202 rushing yards per 
game. Johnson has gotten just 
11 carries for 57 yards, but right 
now, he’s focused on being part 
of a unit that amasses large totals 
together.

After two torn ACLs, he’s not 

taking any role for granted, even 
if that means standing on the 
sideline, watching Smith carry 
the load. He isn’t content to warm 
the bench, but at the same time, 
he roots for his fellow backs, his 
friends, to succeed.

“We aren’t having to have 

this pissing contest to see who 
can kick the other in the shins 
harder,” Johnson said.

But Johnson is getting closer 

to being able to take back part of 
the load, adding burst and agility 
to a backfield that is mostly built 
for power.

“Obviously, 
like 
I 
said, 

everyone wants to be the starter,” 
Johnson said. “But I’m happy 
with wherever they’ll play me. I 
just want to be effective for the 
team, essentially. If that’s being 
a third-down back, if that’s goal-
line back, if that’s second-string 
back. Whatever it is, I just want 
to help the team in a positive 
manner.”

The time for pity has long 

since passed. Now, Johnson just 
wants to play football.

in spring practice, Michigan’s 
secondary knew there were going 
to be changes in 2015. The unit 
wasn’t sure what those changes 
entailed, though, until it got onto 
the field.

Suddenly, 
the 
cornerbacks 

were in the faces of wide receivers, 
running 
backs 
and 
linemen. 

Rather than standing five yards 
back and waiting for the play to 
reveal itself, the Wolverines were 
on top of the offense right at the 
snap.

That only intensified come 

August, 
when 
the 
Michigan 

football coaching staff increased 
man coverage in the secondary.

The 
cornerbacks 
were 

exhausted, but, aside from a few 
miscues, they were thriving — 
recording 90 turnovers in three 
weeks of training camp practices.

With eight returning starters 

and over a dozen key contributors 
back from last season, much of the 
Wolverines’ development into the 
nation’s second-best defense this 
fall can be attributed to simply 
growing up.

But in recording a shutout over 

then-No. 22 Brigham Young, the 
secondary made it loud and clear 
what the key to their success was — 
they were manning up more than 
many had in their entire careers.

“We noticed all the way 

through camp we were doing 
man, that’s all we practice really,” 
said redshirt junior cornerback 
Jeremy Clark. “We were really 
prepared for a season of it. We 
were all on board with it.”

Like any football decision, 

increasing man coverage in the 
secondary comes with pros and 
cons. It’s more physical, risky 
and challenging, but can equate 
to more turnovers, fewer big 
plays and — most importantly 
for Michigan — a smash-mouth 
identity that sends chills down 
opposing offenses’ spines.

“It’s a compliment to me that 

(Michigan defensive coordinator 

D.J. Durkin) thinks we can play 
like that in man coverage,” said 
senior cornerback Jeremy Clark. 
“It’s tiring, but as Coach Durkin 
says, we want to play aggressive, 
and to do that we’ve got to play 
man coverage. We love it.”

On Saturday, the Wolverines 

stood tall against the Cougars’ 
four 6-foot-4 or taller receivers, 
holding 
quarterback 
Tanner 

Mangum to just 12 completions 
on 28 attempts.

In four games this season, 

Michigan 
has 
held 
opposing 

quarterbacks 
to 
a 
93.93 

quarterback rating, 43.4 points 
below 
those 
quarterbacks’ 

season averages. That, too, can be 
attributed to the man coverage.

“I really like it — it allows 

them to be aggressive with the 
receivers and take control,” said 
senior safety Jarrod Wilson. “I 
know it’s tiresome for them, but it 
makes my job easier so I can just 
focus on the quarterback and get 
my reads off the quarterback and 
make some plays.”

Having to track the receivers 

from the opening snap tires 

cornerbacks out over the course of 
the game, and corner may be one 
of Michigan’s thinnest positions. 
But the Wolverines feel more than 
ready to continue meeting that 
challenge.

“If you tell a corner they can’t 

sit back on their heels, they have 
to be aggressive and go after the 
receiver, they’re not going to 
hesitate,” Wilson said. “(Playing 
man’s) got them excited now, and 
they’re rising to that challenge.”

Though Michigan has just 

three interceptions in four games, 
the entire defense has felt the 
effect of the man coverage.

In addition to being second in 

the nation in yards allowed, the 
Wolverines are fourth in points 
allowed, 10th in pass defense and 
17th in tackles tackles for loss per 
game with eight, all thanks to the 
secondary.

“Every time we get a sack, we 

know it’s because our secondary 
made sure nothing was open,” 
said senior defensive tackle Mario 
Ojemudia. “I definitely tip my 
hat to the secondary — they’re 
playing great.”

Hackett discusses athletics in chat

Michigan’s interim 

athletic director 
met with students 
Tuesday evening

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Around 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, 

Michigan 
interim 
Athletic 

Director Jim Hackett was sitting 
in an armchair in the Pond Room 
at the Michigan Union when his 
phone rang. He took it out of his 
pocket and looked at the number.

“This 
is 
Coach 
(Jim) 

Harbaugh,” 
Hackett 
said, 

drawing awe from the crowd. 
“But I’m going to call him later.”

Hackett had other business to 

tend to. Tuesday night, he held 
a town hall meeting with about 
30 students to exchange ideas 
about the student experience in 
Michigan sports. Topics ranged 
from the school’s new Nike 
apparel contract, to the Maize 
Rage seating policies, to football 
scheduling.

Hackett’s appearance — and 

his postponement of business 
with his famous football coach 
— came as part of the Athletic 
Department’s mission to interact 
more with the students than the 
previous regime did in an effort 
to gain their support.

Five senior associate athletic 

directors accompanied Hackett 
to help convey the department’s 
vision.

“I brought help because the 

way I run athletics is, really, 
I don’t make every decision,” 
Hackett said. “I believe in 
empowering others with great 
talent — I should say better than 
I am in lots of aspects of our 
business — to hear with me what 
you’re talking about.”

In the 11 months he has been in 

office, Hackett has worked with 
his team on fairly comprehensive 
changes 
throughout 
the 

department. He has reunited the 
Michigan fan base and revived 
morale, an effort punctuated 
by two key accomplishments: 
the hiring of Harbaugh and the 
new apparel contract with Nike 
worth $169 million over 15 years.

The latter of those was the 

first topic of discussion at the 
meeting Tuesday. A student first 
asked about the impact the Nike 
deal will have on campus. For 
instance, the contract dictates 
that the company must hire four 
Michigan students as corporate 
interns each year. The Athletic 
Department is still working 
on the process of selecting 
those interns, but the new deal 
nonetheless 
promises 
wide-

ranging benefits.

“It turns out the financial 

rewards, which are extensive, 
isn’t the whole reason we picked 

them,” Hackett said. “We kind of 
assumed Michigan would get its 
due. It’s a really powerful brand. 
So we went after thinking about, 
which one aligns with our notion 
of, we want to be kind of the 
smart Athletic Department.”

To shift the conversation with 

the apparel companies away 
from money and product and 
toward the University took some 
convincing. Now, the discussion 
centers around the campus: 
Besides the student internships, 
the Athletic Department and 
Nike are attempting to plan 
community events or teaching 
exercises.

Those aspects and the product 

combined to make Nike a more 
popular choice in the decision 
than Adidas or Under Armour. 
Tuesday, Hackett took a poll of 
how many students preferred 
each brand in the spring — 
the last time he held a similar 
fireside chat — and the answer 
was overwhelmingly Nike.

At the same time, another 

student followed up, wanting 
to make sure that the tradition 
of Michigan was being upheld, 
which 
Hackett 
said 
was 
a 

priority, 
though 
Nike 
does 

dictate most of the conversation.

“This is college,” Hackett 

said. “This isn’t pro. This isn’t 
Las Vegas. It’s not trying to be 
super 
flashy. 

It’s not trying 
to be a fashion 
statement. It’s 
a statement of 
a college. It’s 
Michigan.”

Of 
course, 

much of the 
apparel 
news 

at 
Michigan 

has 
centered 

around the football uniforms 
carrying the Jordan brand’s 
jumpman logo. Hackett said 
former Heisman Trophy winner 
Charles Woodson first advised 
him of the possibility of working 
with Jordan’s brand.

Hackett, in turn, took the idea 

to his football coach.

“The minute I took this to 

Coach Harbaugh,” Hackett said, 
“he said, ‘Sweet.’ ”

The conversation soon shifted 

to basketball, where most of the 
discussion regarding the student 
experience has revolved around 
the Maize Rage. In recent years, 
students have called for their 
section to take up more of the 
lower bowl in an effort to create 
a more exciting environment. 
Hackett faced this question at 
his last town hall meeting in 
April, when he answered that 
the Athletic Department was 
working on a solution.

When 
a 
student 
brought 

the issue back up on Tuesday, 
Hackett and his team said 
expansion was still a goal, but 
it also poses a conflict to season 

ticket holders. Putting more 
student seats in the lower bowl 
could move dedicated season 
ticket holders higher up.

“It 
is 
a 

challenge, 
and there’s no 
promises 
on 

what we can 
do because of 
that 
tension 

between those 
two 
groups, 

but we’re open 
to having this 
conversation,” 

said Rob Rademacher, one of 
Hackett’s aides and the Athletic 
Department’s chief operating 
officer.

The basketball talk included 

another popular point of debate, 
the idea of putting two Final Four 
banners from the Fab Five teams 
back in the rafters at Crisler 
Center. The University took 
down the 1992 and 1993 national 
finalist banners in 2002 as part 
of the NCAA sanctions. The 
10-year period of dissociation 
between four former players and 
the University ended in 2013.

A Maize Rage member on 

Tuesday 
advocated 
for 
the 

banners being replaced, citing 
popular opinion from the group 
at a meeting Monday night.

Much like the expansion of 

the student section, that issue 
has 
broader 
consequences, 

though. 
Elizabeth 
Heinrich, 

the chief student development 
and compliance officer, noted 
that the NCAA has vacated 
Michigan’s wins from those 
Final Four seasons. As a result, 
the tournament runs did not 

technically 
happen, 
per 
the 

NCAA’s definition.

Hackett 
and 
his 
team 

said they would be open to 
commemorating those teams in 
some other way, but reinstating 
vacated banners might prove to 
be too great of a challenge.

Most of the rest of the 

discussion 
centered 
around 

football, including opponents 
and 
the 
Michigan 
Stadium 

experience. One student asked 
about 
the 
scheduling 
quirk 

that resulted in the Michigan 
State and Ohio State games now 
being in Ann Arbor in the same 
season and away from home 
every other season. That was 
a concession the Wolverines 
were forced to make when the 
Big Ten added Maryland and 
Rutgers, expanded to 14 teams 
and divided into East and West 
divisions.

Other Big Ten opponents, as 

well as marquee non-conference 
opponents, could remedy that 
effect, with one standing out in 
particular: Notre Dame, which 
ended its series with Michigan 
last season.

The rivalry has reentered 

the conversation in the media 
over the past couple of weeks, 
with Hackett, Harbaugh and 
Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly 
all coming out in support of a 
renewal.

“There’s not a negative force,” 

Hackett 
said 
Tuesday. 
“I’m 

really open to it, and I believe 
in it. I think it’s a destiny kind 
of game, with two programs — 
one is the No. 1 in total number 
of wins, the other is the No. 
1 in percentage of victories. 

They should be playing, and I 
wanted to send a signal to the 
whole world that Michigan’s not 
sitting there mad because they 
were the ones that exited the 
last time. We have to get over 
that.”

Hackett 
was 
unavailable 

for 
further 
comment 
after 

the fireside chat, but Chrissi 
Rawak (one of 
Hackett’s aides 
who 
handles 

external 
relations) 
and 
Kurt 

Svoboda, 
the 

department’s 
associate 
athletic 
director 
for 
media 

relations, 
confirmed no phone calls have 
been made. Michigan does not 
have an open date on its schedule 
until 2018.

In the present, the students 

were focused on their experience 
at Michigan Stadium. A graduate 
student inquired about creating 
a separate section for graduate 
students, 
to 
help 
improve 

attendance. Another asked about 
finding a way to group people 
together to make the experience 
more enjoyable and avoid making 
students sit alone at the top of 
the stadium. A third brought up 
the idea of allowing students on 
the field before the game as a 
promotion.

The Athletic Department does 

not have plans in the works on 
any of those fronts, but accepted 
the feedback. Hackett and his 
team’s main goal Tuesday was to 

move closer to the students after 
a tumultuous era under former 
Athletic Director Dave Brandon.

Before 
the 
meeting, 
the 

engagement team went over its 
goals for both the department 
and the students using a number 
of charts and lists taped on the 
wall. Phase one, as they called 
it, focused on the present, with 

phases 
two 

and three on 
the near and 
distant future, 
respectively.

In the near 

future, 
the 

department 
vowed 
to 

“confront 
emotional 
issues” 
such 

as lack of trust 

and lack of voice. The session 
before the meeting included 
surveys from students, including 
“tension wires,” the results of 
which 
were 
skewed 
heavily 

toward feeling like a customer 
over family and feeling muted 
over having a strong voice.

In the distant future, the 

Athletic 
Department 
wanted 

students to build a foundation of 
support at what Hackett went on 
to call an elite university — with 
one caveat, he said.

“We don’t want to be an 

arrogant place,” he told students. 
“We want to be humble. We 
want to win and be humble 
about it and have the pride that 
this is the best place. But if you 
go around talking about it, then 
it’s arrogance. I hope that comes 
through that we’re not trying to 
be an arrogant group of people.”

F

irst, a joke: University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, if by “party 

culture” you mean sitting 
alone in your room, listening 
to a Pete Holmes podcast and 
thinking about masturbating, 
then I am definitely devaluing 
my education.

Thank you.
Spoiler Alert: This ends at 

3:30 a.m. with a couch, a movie 
and my Someone Special. 
Gush, nay?

Here goes:
I flirted with a woman. Yes, 

me, the leaser of a Murphy 
bed/owner 
of 
a 
Squirrel 

puppet. Most of my bumblings 
with women become fodder for 
my 
I’ll-Show-Them-When-

I’m-Famous book, but this one 
was different. No, wait, not 
different. Worse. 

She’s where my night began. 

(Wide shot of a crowded 
college street. “Baba O’Reilly” 
plays.)

At the Greenwood Block 

Party — a massive devaluation 
of our education — while my 
good 
buddy 
Graham 
was 

using these girls’ apartment-
bathroom, 
a 
beautiful 

sophomore (for anonymity’s 
sake, let’s call her “Richard 
Nixon”) asked me about my 
apartment.

“Yeah, it’s a pretty sweet 

deal,” said I, all seductive and 
such. “Got a Murphy bed, it 
folds out of the wall. Got a red 
couch, which is, you know, 
different, which I like. Love it! 
(cough) Oh, and I have my own 
room — yeah! — I put up these 
really cool posters like...”

Oh how we plummet when 

we can’t grow wings!

We 
asked 
Beth 
(Oops. 

Richard Nixon.) to join us 
at another party. She waved 
goodbye. Guess Nixon didn’t 
want to hear about my “Raiders 
of the Lost Ark” poster or my 
bagel supply or my stuffed 
meerkat Jerome.

Ricky-Nix, if you’re reading 

this: Sorry for going on about 

my posters, and sorry Graham 
was so weird. He’s just a lonely 
guy who really needed your 
bathroom.

And Graham: Don’t worry 

about that last paragraph. 
Just playing the game, ya 
dig? Coffee later? I like your 
sweater, bud! That wool?

The evening wore on.
Graham and I ended up 

at a bar: Mash, where our 
education further decreased 
in value. We whittled away 
the hours waiting for girls to 
talk to us first, a strategy that’s 
worked zero percent of the 
time, if you’re not counting that 
one day my female doctor told 
me I had a “weird ear canal.”

Once or twice, I peeked 

at the dance floor, imagining 
some 
attainable-looking 

woman holding a sign that said, 
“Hey, Alex Bernard! I’m not at 
all turned off by your weird, 
tiny wrists. Let’s do mind-
blowing oral sex!” (Note to self: 
Look up definition of “oral.”) 

Or maybe a woman giving 

me The Look, the one that said, 
“Yes. You. You’re what I had in 
mind.”

But 
I’m 
never 
that 

Somebody In Mind for anyone. 
I think when people are 
attracted to me, they’re proud 
of themselves for being so 
open-minded.

Which is fine, really. I’m 

proud of them too.

The dance floor was empty 

though, just a puddle of man-
sweat and a pounding in my 
head that was either the Queen 
cover band or that medical 
condition my doctor keeps 
calling, “Sadness.”

Explanation: I’d just broken 

up with somebody, which — in 
the words of my great-great-
grandfather — sucked major 
dick. They always do, break-
ups, or at least, they should. 
This one did — for reasons 
too intimate to disclose to my 
dozens of readers (Hi, Mom). 
It sucked.

So how I felt in Mash that 

night was … fine. Exactly 
fine. 
Rejected, 
foolish, 

uncomfortable. But fine. God, 
it was — is — terrible to be so 
Just OK.

The night wore on and on 

again and again, like it wanted 
to wear on. Eventually, I went 
to the bar alone and ordered 
my third free Coke. On TV, 
football was starting or ending. 
It was 1:30 a.m.

A girl slid next to me. She 

was blonde. Attractive too, 
which is my type.

She: “Personal question: 

Are you single?” I was. “Look 
over my shoulder.” – Shit. – 
“See my friend?” I did. “She’s 
also single and thinks you’re 
attractive. Can I set you guys 
up?”

I said I was flattered but fine, 

with my friends, didn’t want 
to do anything tonight, had 
cholesterol and chlorophyll 
and yada-yada-yada. It goes on.

But why? Why say no, you 

lonely man?

I don’t know. Back off, 

Sharon.

Maybe, I just didn’t think 

she was attractive. Maybe I 
just wanted to hang out with 
Graham. Maybe I hadn’t had 
enough Cokes to say “yes.” Ha.

Graham came up to me, gave 

me a look that said, “Whatever 
it is, me too,” and murmured 
our code word:

“Scott-Pilgrim.”
Which means, “Let’s go 

watch ‘Scott Pilgrim.’”

So we did, the first half. 

And then, at 3:30 a.m., I rose 
from his couch, high-fived 
my Special Someone, left 
Graham’s 
apartment 
and 

dragged myself home, where I 
sat in my chair for a while.

Then, after that while, I 

sighed, opened my computer, 
clicked a Pete Holmes podcast 
and devalued my education.

At 4:30 a.m., I went to bed.

If you have a crush on Alex, 
email him at adbnard@umich.
edu. He won’t know otherwise.

Another Thing: I devalued my education last night

My Cultural Currency: Aunties

I

t is a truth, universally 
acknowledged, 
that 
every 

Indian woman over the age of 

40 must be referred to as “Auntie,” 
regardless of blood relation.

Aunties™ are a permanent 

fixture at every temple celebration, 
birthday, engagement, and, of 
course, wedding. She is, at once, 
indiscreet 
and 
inconspicuous, 

extroverted 
and 
passive-

aggressive, 
all-knowing 
and 

ignorant.

The Auntie is the 

most 
formidable 

creature in Indian 
society — whether 
it is in the diaspora 
or the motherland 
itself — and an entire 
group 
of 
Aunties 

are a force to be 
reckoned with.

Every 
Indian 

woman you know 
will either be or is 
already an Auntie 
and, before becoming 
full-fledged Aunties, 
we all manage to 
develop 
Auntie 

tendencies early in 
life.

The 
Aunties 

have 
three 
true 

purposes and, when 
the dormant Auntie 
gene is activated in 
an Indian woman, 
it becomes her life’s 
mission to achieve 
those three goals. 

First, Aunties must be in touch 

with all of society’s gossip.

An Auntie will not leave a 

room of people before finding out 
exactly whose son had “an affair” 
with whose daughter. They know 
which Uncle — a topic for another 
day — got in a fight with whom 
over temple donations, which 
Auntie wore fake jewelry to which 
event and whose kid got into what 
trouble at which school.

If 
you’re 
ever 
having 
a 

conversation with an older Indian 
woman and you feel like she’s 
looking at you funny — like she’s 
peering straight into your soul — 
you’re not going crazy.

That’s exactly what she’s doing. 

Whether or not you want her to 
know your business is irrelevant.

Second, an Auntie must always 

come out on top of the food chain.

In the Game of Thrones, as 

everyone is well aware, you either 

win or you die. Indian society is 
basically Game of Thrones, but 
with lower stakes.

And finally, an Auntie’s ultimate 

goal — her Mount Everest — is to 
get every eligible bachelor and 
bachelorette married off.

There you are at the temple 

dining area, waiting in line to get a 
second helping of pakora. The line 
in front of you is thinning out and 
you’re almost there, the pakoras 
are almost on your plate. The 

tongs are in your hand; you think 
you’re going to make it scot-free 
when suddenly someone grabs 
your hand and says, “So how are 
you beta? How is school? What 
is your major? Where are you 
working? You have boyfriend?”

Aunties are walking, talking 

Shaadi.com 
profiles. 
They’re 

always eager to tell you about 
Mr. Patel’s son who is working as 
an engineer in San Francisco. If 

you’re in medical 
school, 
you’re 

basically catnip to 
them.

That 
being 

said, there are, of 
course, anomalies, 
the black sheep, 
the outliers: Vodka 
Aunties. These are 
the Aunties that 
are too forward-
thinking, 
don’t 

keep their children 
on a leash and ask 
kids, “Please, don’t 
call 
me 
Auntie, 

OK? Just call me 
Dolly.”

Vodka Aunties 

are 
lone 
wolves 

— 
unprotected 

against the wrath 
of the alpha Auntie 
pack. Their every 
action, 
every 

outfit and every 
conversation 
is 

measured 
and 

judged to filth by 

the alpha Aunties.

The other day, my roommates 

and I were sitting on our couch 
one late Sunday night, all of us 
tired from a long day of studying. 
We were nursing cups of chai and 
gossiping about the South Asian 
student groups and dance teams 
on campus. That’s when it hit me.

We were on our way developing 

Auntie tendencies and it’s only a 
matter of time before we become 
full-fledged Aunties.

MORALLY BANKRUPT: 

The Greek life crisis

By Chloe Gilke, Managing Arts Editor

E

verything is immaculately organized. 
The Panhellenic Association’s recruit-
ment mass meeting will convene in the 

Michigan League’s Ballroom from 5 to 8 p.m. 
There will be 17 tables, one for each chapter in 
Panhel and each table will be decorated with 
posters, paper cutouts and smiling girls in skirts 
and T-shirts.

I double-check the time written in my pink 

Moleskine before I step out the door — 6:00 
isn’t too late, unless this thing was supposed to 
actually be a three-hour commitment. But that 
doesn’t make sense. Would our sisters actually 
keep us tied to chairs in the League for three 
hours, testing our dedication before the rush 
process even begins? I’m freaking out. And I’m 
not even rushing.

Greek life is a powerful social system on 

campus — powerful enough to make a seasoned 
journalist sweat through three layers of BareM-
inerals powder and powerful enough to draw a 
crowd of hundreds to a standard Thursday eve-
ning mass meeting.

At the beginning of my freshman year, I 

considered joining a sorority. I ended up mak-
ing some friends in my hall and getting really 
busy with my film classes, and I chose not to 
rush. But sometimes I think about how my col-
lege experience would have been different if I’d 
stood in the League Ballroom three years ago, 
and found my family of sisters who made me 
miss home and Chicago a little less. Even as a 
senior, that’s an appealing prospect.

But I’m not writing this to justify my own 

decision to tough it out and carve out my friend 
group the old-fashioned way. I’m not writing 
this to put down anyone who joined Greek Life 
and loves it, and I’m not trying to capitalize on 
the stories of those who tried it and decided it 
wasn’t for them. I’m writing this article for my 
Ballroom-mates who chose not to hide behind a 
pink Moleskine and a prestigious editorial posi-
tion at the campus newspaper. I’m writing this 
for all those orphans, floating by the intricately 
decorated tables, plastering on a smile and wait-
ing to find their family.

According to data compiled by the University 

in winter 2015, 21.43 percent of the undergradu-
ate population is involved in Greek life. Students 

who would like to join Greek Life are presented 
with several options: 28 official fraternities in 
the Interfraternity Council, 17 sororities in the 
Panhellenic Association and 12 sororities and 
fraternities in the Multicultural Greek Council. 
The recruitment process and other aspects of 
Greek life are formally governed by these stu-
dent-led groups.

The Panhellenic Association (referred to as 

‘“Panhel” by many members of the Greek com-
munity) mandates that Potential New Mem-
bers (PNMs) participate in a formal September 
recruitment process. After the mass meet-
ings, each PNM participates in a series of mix-
ers and parties, briefly meeting women from 
every sorority before the second and third set 
events, where their choices are narrowed down 
through a mutual selection process. By Octo-
ber, sororities make bids on their top PNMs, 
each woman selects her favorite of the bids and 
pledges to the corresponding sorority.

The University’s Interfraternity Council 

website labels its recruitment system as “open” 
and “informal,” which means that the experi-
ence of rushing a frat differs a lot from house to 
house. But in general, young men who rush fra-
ternities do not have to attend events and meet-
and-greets at every fraternity; most guys pick 
between one and three frats to rush. Events are 
focused on evaluating the potential for a guy 
to join as one of the brothers, and male PNMs 
spend more time at an individual house during 
the rush process than their female equivalents. 
After weeks of parties, events and brotherly 
bonding, a fraternity will choose whether or not 
to make a bid on a guy, and if he is lucky enough 
to be accepted to more than one fraternity, the 
young pledge picks his favorite of the bunch.

When interviewed, many members of the 

Greek community for this story were tight-
lipped about what goes on behind closed doors 
during those recruitment events. This is no sur-
prise, considering that the IFC and Panhel are 
notoriously watchful during regular recruit-
ment months, and are especially so in the recent 
firestorm of Greek controversy.

On Thursday, Sept. 10 (coincidentally, the 

same night as the Panhellenic Association’s 
mass meeting), members of every Greek chapter 
attended a mandatory discussion with Universi-

ty President Mark Schlissel and other members 
of University administration. Schlissel talked 
openly about his frustration with Greek life’s 
party culture, perpetuated through viral videos 
like “I’m Shmacked” and evidenced through 
incidents like Sigma Alpha Mu’s destruction 
of the Treetops Resort this past January. And 
party culture has consequences vastly worse 
than a night in the emergency room: A recent 
University-wide survey cited that members of 
Greek life are 2.5 times more likely to experi-
ence sexual assault than their non-Greek peers.

LSA sophomore Julia Baer, a Delta Delta 

Delta sister, recalled her rush experience as 
being “a blur,” but was quick to point out that 
she never experienced any of the darker, news-
headline-worthy aspects of Greek life.

“I feel like this reputation that exists because 

of a few people, and that’s really a shame, 
because it’s not representative of the commu-
nity at all,” Baer said.

LSA senior Jessica* recalled picking out 

her outfit before the first mixer of recruitment 
season freshman year. Her Rho Omega — an 
upperclassman sorority member in charge of 
overseeing groups of PNMs — called Jessica 
with a few helpful tips and reminders.

“She said that some of the houses I was gonna 

go to were going to have cheese and cracker 
plates out, and that it was actually a test,” Jes-
sica said. “If I actually ate the cheese and crack-
ers in the houses, I would never get in.”

For Jessica, this was the moment where she 

decided that she wouldn’t continue rushing.

“That’s just so not me. Obviously, I was going 

to eat the cheese and crackers. I love cheese and 
crackers! It became this symbolic thing, like I 
can’t join an organization that wouldn’t accept 
me because I eat cheese.”

Jessica said she was ostracized by some of her 

friends after she decided not to rush. She had 
already talked to a few older girls in one of the 
sororities, and one friend had even approached 
the president of a chapter and promoted Jessica 
to her. Since she’d asked for favors and other 
girls had gone out of their way to comply, Jes-
sica’s Greek friends felt slighted.

“That was actually the hardest thing to 

say no to. Once I felt like I was already being 

accepted by this group, to refuse that, it actually 
tarnished my friendship with those people,” 
Jessica said.

This subtle not-hazing, low-grade emotional 

warfare is a typical experience of rush for many 
girls. With the Panhel mandate of visiting every 
sorority and making connections in every room 
comes the inevitability of getting cut and facing 
rejection from many of the houses.

Baer remembered adoring Tri Delta so much 

that she thought of “suiciding” it — choosing 
Tri Delta as her only preference, meaning that 
if she weren’t accepted she would not be a part 
of Greek life. But Baer weighed her options and 
decided that she’d rather join a less-preferred 
sorority than spend all that time and effort in 
recruitment for nothing.

“I would not go through (recruitment) again. 

It’s emotional torture. It’s awful. But I was 
like, ‘I’m just gonna put everything down, and 
whatever house I get in, I’ll be in. I’ll make great 
friends no matter what,’ ” Baer said.

Not everyone sees Greek life in such an egali-

tarian way.

Many rushees refer to a website called 

GreekRank, which allows users to anonymous-
ly rate chapters based on qualities like “looks,” 
“classiness,” and “social life.” Comments on the 
site perpetuate “tiers” and other reductive ste-
reotypes of particular chapters, but the data on 
the site is irresistible, and influences many girls’ 
rush preferences.

Baer, who hails from New York, believes that 

many in-state girls, who hear rumors about the 
tendencies of chapters, allow all the labels to 
influence their decisions in rush.

“A lot of people coming from Michigan come 

into rush with the idea that they have to be in 
‘XYZ’ or they won’t do it,” Baer said. “For me, 
being in Tri Delt hasn’t been about rank at all. 
That’s not what I wanted, that’s not what it is. 
I have a great group of friends, my best friends, 
and it’s not a status thing at all.”

Baer doesn’t sugar-coat the exhausting weeks 

of rush and the stress that comes with choosing 
houses to preference, but she insists upon the 
merits of the end result — philanthropy, friend-
ship, sisterhood, and a home away from home.

“I think, in general, girls go through this 

thing that’s like, mentally draining and emo-

tionally draining. But from there on, it’s smooth 
sailing.”

When LSA senior Michael* rushed a non-IFC 

frat, he expected a good time.

The Interfraternity Council (or, as one 

source affectionately dubbed them, the “frat 
police”) is in many ways the laid-back brother 
of overachieving Panhel. They oversee the two-
week periods of fraternity rush in the fall and 
winter, help with coordinating events and set 
recruitment deadlines and other rules that keep 
fraternities in line with University standards. 
Without the IFC to organize mass meetings 
and promote their chapters, non-IFC frats are 
on their own for recruitment — but they also 
have leeway in extending the rush and pledge 
periods … and the freedom to bend a few rules.

“The first event I went to, they gave us some 

free pizza, free beer and free weed, so that’s 
fine, I’m down with that,” Michael recalled.

Having older male friends in fraternities is a 

large part of why many guys rush fraternities. 
Though Michael was a self-professed “straight-
edge dude” during his freshman year, as he 
became more entrenched in Ann Arbor culture 
he made more friends involved in alternative 
Greek Life, so he decided to rush during his 
junior year.

“Partially, I would say, it was a peer-pressure 

thing. (My friends) invited me to check out the 
house, and I was like, ‘Why not?’ And this par-
ticular frat had the reputation of being a not-
standard frat, and (a standard frat) is something 
I knew I wouldn’t be into,” Michael said.

Despite the fact that he was rushing a non-

IFC frat, Michael recognized some of the same 
dynamics from his uncles’ playful hazing sto-
ries of eating goldfish (yes, the swimming kind) 
and being locked in basements with kegs.

“I do believe they do hazing, but it’s not like 

they’re going to beat your ass with a paddle or 
anything like that,” Michael said.

Michael started to have his doubts about 

recruitment when he saw how long it went on 
— from free pizza in early October until the 
middle of January, when PNMs finally gradu-
ated to pledges.

In his three months of rushing, Michael had 

to memorize facts, songs and perform in front of 

the brothers. He had to clean bathrooms, wear a 
sweatpants uniform, give up his phone and stay 
locked in a room until one of the brothers grant-
ed him permission to leave. Toward the end, 
every minute he wasn’t in class, he was sup-
posed to spend at the frat. Finally, he decided he 
couldn’t take it anymore.

“Their justification for making you go 

through all of this is that, when you’re done, you 
get to be part of this awesome social group and 
live in this cool house, and you have brothers 
forever, and it’s gonna be great. I didn’t doubt 
that these guys were going to be friendly after-
wards, but I didn’t agree with their condition 
that to be a part of this group, you have to accept 
the emotional abuse.”

The week before recruitment ended, Michael 

notified the brothers that he was dropping out. 
They begged him to stay, offered to change and 
to cut the bullshit and start treating him bet-
ter. In Michael’s words, both sides behaved like 
a couple in an “abusive relationship,” where 
one cannot control the horrors it inflicts and 
the other can’t resist the desire to be loved and 
accepted. Despite the bartering (the frat offered 
to let him back in without completing the last 
week of “events”), Michael broke it off.

Michael remains good friends with a lot of 

the guys in the frat, and made sure to tell me 
several times that his experience “wasn’t the 
worst thing ever in the world” and that the frat 
he rushed is generally one of the gentler, more 
“forward-thinking” ones on campus.

He sees the appeal in joining a fraternity, 

especially as a means to community-building.

“They welcome you with open arms. They 

say, ‘We’ll give you all the weed and all the girls 
you want,’ not telling you up-front what you 
have to do to actually get to the end. It isn’t sold 
as the intense kind of experience that it actually 
is.”

Several of the young women interviewed for 

this story referred to rush as “a blur,” a rigid and 
exhausting three weeks that one has to endure 
get to the wonderful part of Greek life — the 
sisterhood and the house and the luxury of par-
ticipating in recruitment from the other side. 
For fraternity members, however, the lack of 
rigid governing structure means that the hard 

part can bleed over into the months following 
recruitment, the pledge period and the whole 
first year.

According to one study, women who rushed 

sororities were more likely to self-report feel-
ings of low self-esteem than before they rushed. 
A Northwestern University study cited soror-
ity rush as a catalyst for self-objectification 
and poor body image in college-aged women. 
For example, curvier women are more likely 
to experience feelings of low self-worth after 
judgment from their peers. According to the 
study, for every additional point in a woman’s 
Body Mass Index — a standardized calcula-
tion of weight in reference to height — she is 44 
percent more likely to drop out of rush. Even 
after rush, women in sororities are more likely 
to maintain dysfunctional and harmful eating 
patterns than their non-Greek peers.

For fraternity members, hazing has lasting 

impact self-esteem and self-worth. A 2005 study 
reported that “striving to belong to a particular 
group, especially during ritualized initiations, 
may result in the justification of that effort, 
thereby inoculating individuals against any dis-
sonant cognition they may harbor concerning 
the consequences of group membership.” The 
desire to be a part of the group can desensitize 
members to harmful group practices like objec-
tification of women, alcohol and drug abuse and 
other destructive behaviors.

How do these tragedies happen in organiza-

tion that’s built on principles of friendship and 
philanthropy?

The members of Greek life interviewed for 

this article point out the difficulty of rebuild-
ing the foundation of Greek life, making it more 
fair and inclusive. The University’s Greek com-
munity is celebrating its 170th anniversary 
this year, and there’s no denying that campus 
has undergone significant political and social 
changes since the 19th century. Greek life, in its 
great size and prominence, is just a little slower 
in getting with the times.

The Multicultural Greek Council offers 

Greek opportunities for students who want 
to join a group of other philanthropy-minded 
students in their ethnic community, but Baer 
wishes that Panhel’s homogenous reputation 
would break down and encourage more diverse 

recruitment.

“Something that has really bothered me is 

hearing the way people talk, even within the 
Panhellenic system, there being sororities that 
are, like known as being, ‘Jewish’ and ‘not Jew-
ish.’ That creates the issue of someone feeling 
like the outsider in such a tight-knit commu-
nity. But this is college, and we’re so integrated 
and always interacting with such amazing and 
diverse people … I do wish there was that kind 
of diversity in Greek life,” Baer said.

While leadership in Panhel and the IFC did 

not respond to requests for a comment, sorority 
and fraternity members claim that Greek lead-
ership is trying to change the system. But it isn’t 
easy.

“The guys, after I left (the fraternity), told 

me that they were in the process of trying to fix 
everything. But they were running up against 
opposition from alumni who were expecting 
(the frat) to continue with the same traditions 
that they were a part of,” Michael said.

Baer echoed the frustration of trying to 

reshape an institution that has had 170 years to 
calcify its traditions.

“I wish I knew how to fix it.”

At the Panhel mass meeting, I stand toward 

the back of the ballroom. I’m always a wall-
flower, but today, I’m also an old, sweaty upper-
classman who doesn’t want to block the fresh 
recruits from the view of a table that might have 
info about their future home and their future 
sisters. I can’t see exactly what’s written on 
the posters and am only gleaning bits of what 
the older girls are saying to the mass meet-
ing attendees. (I hear something about grilled 
cheese for charity, which sounds amazing from 
every angle.)

If any of these girls took a look at my banged-

up Moleskine or heard the tinny of some 
Neutral Milk Hotel song playing from the ear-
buds dangling around my neck, they’d know I 
definitely don’t belong in this room right now. 
Maybe I never belonged. But I’m here now, so I 
might as well grab a pamphlet and listen.

I

t’s a Game Day in late September, and hoards of maize 
and blue-tinged students are streaming down State 
Street to the sounds of The Weeknd’s “Can’t Feel 

My Face.” But just as the University cements its place on 
Playboy’s annual list of top party schools, it’s equally the 
stomping grounds of the hipster — so much so that the town 
garnered the dubious distinction of being the 15th most 
hipster city in America.

So where is the hipster in Ann Arbor? Probably in a 

restaurant. Nothing better encapsulates taste, that elusive 
hipster currency, better than Ann Arbor restaurants. Freed 
from its functional properties, the cuisine of a trendy small-
plates spot is a formalistic delight for the hipster. At once 
appealing to sensual faculties, restaurants, which Ann Arbor 
is abundant in (as well as cocktail bars, cafes and gourmet 
grocery stores) also fulfill the intellectual desire to know 
how the ingredients work, to observe ingredients perform as 
they should, stripped from the corporate magic of chemicals 
and preservatives. Restaurants are where the Ann Arbor 
hipsters are.

Transparency is the name of the game in Ann Arbor’s 

foodie culture. In Ann Arbor, you can buy juice from Babo 
with just six or seven ingredients, all of which are organic 
fruits and vegetables. At the farmer’s market, sellers move 
their local, pesticide-free goods straight into the reusable 
cotton totes of local Ann Arborites. On the menu at Mani 
Osteria, a popular Italian small plates restaurant, the dishes 
are named by ingredient, followed by a small description 
of further ingredients. “Cauliflower Fritti: shallots, pickled 
chile, bacon jam” is the antithesis of “Big Mac,” which 
reveals nothing of its origins or its parts. In Ann Arbor, you 
can eat ice cream that was made in front of you at Blank Slate 
or check Lab’s tumblr to see where their cold brew coffee is 
from.

Of course, transparency comes with a hefty price tag, 

and seems marketed to its own (predominantly white) 
demographic. And more so, authenticity and transparency 
can become their own fetishes: Whole Foods sold Asparagus 
Water’ (ingredients: asparagus, water) for $6 at a store 
in Brentwood, California and a small bowl of bone broth 
(ingredients: bones, water) can be purchased at Brodo 
in Manhattan for $9. But this story of authenticity and 
transparency dates back to times well before most of Ann 
Arbor’s present day hipsters were born.

Where is the hipster from?

The term “hipster” first bubbled to the cultural surface 

in the late 1930s, when jazz gained popularity in Harlem. 
Musicians, artists and followers alike were dubbed “hepcat” 
and their identity accrued the effortless aura of cool. In 1939, 
the language of this identity was transcribed in the satirical 
book, “The Hepster’s Dictionary of Jive” by Cab Calloway 
(who, incidentally, became the first African-American to 
publish a dictionary). The book is full of jazz world jargon, 

conversational entries about munchies, women and music: 
“peppermint candy (n): sweets following a reefer session 
(use of weed creates a craving for sugar)”; “v-8 (n): a chick 
who spurns company, is independent, is not amenable”; and 
“armstrongs (n): musical notes in the upper register, high 
trumpet notes.”

Much like “The Hipster Handbook” published in 2003, 

Calloway’s guide does the curious job of thickening simple 
slang into argot, withholding even as it discloses. Because 
the crux of the book, its uninscribed entry, is that only a real 
“square” would read a book to understand “jive” — how to be 
a real one is the aporia of the text.

All Calloway will write is that a hepcat is “a guy who 

knows all the answers, understands jive.”

How the hipster became white

This dictionary encapsulated the contradictions of 

being a hepcat. After all, the hepcat was necessarily on the 
uncodified fringes of the world, rejecting the old style of 
swing for the bold new genre of jazz. Yet a nihilistic set of 
postwar politics and literary intellectuals, who included Jack 
Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, would soon create conditions 
amenable to canonizing this subculture, and culling it from 
its racial roots. But in order for this term to reach a new level 
of prominence, the aesthetic hold of the hepcat-cum-hipster 
needed to be expanded, transforming the Black musician 
into a mythic figure who had taste for not only jazz and 
chicks, but all of culture.

This strategy is most famously articulated by Norman 

Mailer’s 1957 article “The White Negro.” In it, Mailer argues 
that the political threat of death — its paranoid clamp on the 
Black psyche — inspired the violent and visceral experience 
of jazz, an art that short-circuited the “sophisticated 
inhibitions of civilization” for the “obligatory pleasures of 
the body,” writing that “in (the Black man’s) music he gave 
voice to the character and quality of his existence, to his rage 
and the infinite variations of joy, lust, languor, growl, cramp, 
pinch, scream, and despair of his orgasm.”

In 2015, it’s impossible to overstate the discomfort of 

reading an article like this, of watching Mailer organize 
the aesthetics of jazz by his racist assumptions of Black 
psychology, of seeing him brand the stereotype of primitive 
Blackness under a guise of progressiveness. Yet it remains 
important because it spells out how a section of Whites 
co-opted the moral paradigm of the Black hepcat to navigate 
their own postwar existentialist nightmare: “The hipster 
had absorbed the existentialist synapses of the Negro, and 
for practical purposes could be considered a white Negro.” 
Within this moral paradigm, the hipster is an individualist 
warrior: “Hip morality is to do what one feels whenever and 
wherever it is possible, and — this is how the war of the Hip 
and the Square begins.”

Even Ann Arbor registered this breaking down of 

mores. As Alan Glenn notes in an essay about the history 

of counterculture in Ann Arbor, a School of Public Health 
professor wrote to The Michigan Daily in 1960 to complain 
about the “‘bearded, long-haired, sloppy, unsanitary-looking 
students, who appear to be a refugees from some beatnik 
cave.’ He wondered “just what kind of future citizens they 
will make if they are unwilling or too lazy to present a clean 
appearance at this early stage of their lives.” A few years later 
the Daily’s fashion supplement announced (with more than a 
little sarcasm) that ‘the rigid tradition that had girls wearing 
dresses and boys wearing pants has been broken.’”

The hipster today

This all set the stage for our current hipster stock, behind 

whose music preferences lurk certain philosophical stakes, 
a reflexive cynicism for the mainstream, and a bottomless 
appetite for authenticity. This authenticity is of a taste let 
loose on a whole new swath of cultural material.

In this current conception, mainstream art has effectively 

been plumbed of its merits, its spiritual and intellectual 
flesh picked off the bones by a capitalist machine. The 
“mainstream” product is designed to assuage our sensitivities 
and pleasure centers with unrelenting precision. In the age 
of algorithms and predictive analytics, hipsters instinctively 
know that the cultural goods floating down the mainstream 
have been sent down the river by a corporation and their 
business plan.

Think of Nathaniel Rich, writing in this October issue 

of The Atlantic about the handful of songwriters behind 
a disproportionate number of Top 40 hits, “Ruthless 
digitization, outsourcing, focus-group brand testing, brute-
force marketing...have been applied with tremendous 
success in pop, creating such profitable multinationals 
as Rihanna, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift.” Or think of 
the 2005 screenwriting book by Blake Snyder that breaks 
down the blockbuster into a 15-beat structure and whose 
reverberations still echo in summer mega-hits, or maybe the 
patent Amazon filed for “anticipatory shipping,” a method to 
deliver packages before shoppers even purchase it.

Together, these revelations confirm what hipsters 

always felt in their bones: that cultural popularity is not a 
form of American meritocracy so much as it is the result of 
an aggressive business strategy. This is why the hipster is 
attracted to the elusive substance of authenticity as an acid 
to cut through the gunk of consumer waste.

Authenticity is a way of showing things for how they really 

are. No longer caught in the morass of consumerism, but also 
without the moral compass of mainstream, hipsters find a 
new way of determining value, and that way is taste. Taste 
is written into the secret language Calloway transcribed, 
taste is the dog whistle that only the enlightened can sense, 
taste is the result of a finely developed palate, a palate that 
registers not in moral terms of good and evil, but well or 
poorly executed. Taste cares about form, not function.

But against this optimistic reading of taste as pure 

an Ann Arbor etymology

Personal Statement: Being average

by Michael Flynn, Daily Arts Writer

choice, Colin Gunckel, assistant professor of american 
culture and screen arts and cultures, sees taste as a mode 
of class distinction — much like what sociologist Pierre 
Bordieu elaborated on in “Distinction: A Social Critique in 
the Judgement of Taste.” Like Bordieu, Gunkel believes 
these preferences are generated arbitrarily, and are empty 
signifiers of status. He noted in an e-mail, “The category (of 
hipster) is associated with having a superficial relationship 
to consumption. Going to the ‘hot’ new restaurant or bar that 
everyone is talking about, going to the art show you read 
about on the cover of the weekly, listening to whatever they 
read about on whatever website, dressing like your friends, 

I 

am average.

The Oxford English Dictionary definition of average 

as an adjective is thus: “Of the usual or ordinary 

standard, level or quantity.” That doesn’t seem like a terrible 
thing to be. But for so many people in this generation (and 
in any generation), that is a dirty word. “Average” is the one 
thing most people dread to be. People want to be exceptional. 
People want to make the most money, make the biggest 
difference and be the best friend, partner, student and citizen 
they can possibly be.

This aversion to average-ness is not innate, except in some 

particularly narcissistic cases, but rather the product of 
external forces. Parents tell their children that their abilities 
are exceptional, and all but guarantee that they will do great 
things with their lives. The University of Michigan continues 
this rhetoric, telling tens of thousands of young people that 
they are the “leaders and best,” that they will go on to change 
the world and be successful. After all, if they got into U of M, 
they can’t possibly be average, right?

For a long time, I thought that was I. I thought I was a 

person of exceptional ability, that I was guaranteed a bright, 
successful future. I like to think I’m a reasonably grounded 
individual, but I went through a large chunk of my life with 
an inflated sense of my own contribution to society, without 
much objective proof of that belief.

I went to Campolindo High School, a public school in 

California with a reputation for sending its students to elite 
colleges. I spent my four years there as a high-functioning 
slacker, in academics and in life. I took AP classes, but didn’t 
put an exceptional amount of effort into them. I played 

sports, but didn’t stick with any of them for very long and 
never made varsity. I played guitar, but never joined the 
school band, and didn’t stay in any of the bands I joined 
for much longer than a year. I graduated from Campolindo 
with a solid but unexceptional GPA and an extracurricular 
resume that didn’t show any focus.

Somehow, this (and probably also legacy status, thanks 

Dad) got me into the University of Michigan. I wasn’t a 
harder worker than many of my peers in high school, but 
somehow I got into an elite university. The illusion of my 
own exceptional ability and drive carried on.

When I finally arrived at Michigan, I began to realize that 

I wasn’t prepared for the workload that an elite university 
requires. I continued to procrastinate. I continued to cram 
for tests and write papers the night before they were due. 
The same strategies that had worked for me in high school 
were beginning to crack. And I let them continue to crack. I 
was not galvanized into action. I was complacent.

Looking back on it, I could have easily done something 

about it, but I had no intrinsic desire to do so. I never had 
any real intrinsic desire to succeed academically. The 
reason I worked reasonably hard in school was out of fear of 
disappointing my parents. My father, in particular, placed a 
great deal of weight on academic success. 

It wasn’t until sophomore year that I had a moment of 

clarity. I was procrastinating on homework by Googling 
recent Class of ’14 graduates that I knew to see what they were 
up to. One of them had a website with a link to her resume, 
and as I looked through it, I realized that this was a truly 
exceptional student, with a near-perfect GPA, leadership 

positions in student organizations and work experience. 
The realization of how far removed I was to that level of 
commitment and success hit me like a brick. The illusion of 
my own exceptional ability was shattered.

From that simple realization came a feeling I hadn’t felt 

before: a strong desire to work hard, not for anyone else but 
myself. I felt that I could do so much better than I had done, 
and I resolved to do so. I resolved to leave average behind 
and begin the journey to becoming excellent.

Since then, I’ve made some progress toward that goal, 

though not as much as I would have liked. I’ve raised my 
GPA, if only marginally. I’ve volunteered and pursued 
extracurricular 
activities, 
even 
achieving 
leadership 

positions in some of them. I haven’t stopped faltering and 
making mistakes, but I’ve become better at recognizing 
those mistakes and keeping myself from making them again.

Perhaps the most significant effect of my epiphany is my 

newfound feeling that, while it’s not how I’d like to remain, 
being average at the time of life that I’m in isn’t a terrible 
thing. Barring the unforeseen, I have many more years to 
learn, to grow, to find areas I excel in. And what better place 
to be young and average than the University of Michigan? 
Just by virtue of attending this University, I am exposed to 
new perspectives and accrue meaningful experiences. I will 
take interesting classes and pursue activities that I love. I 
will gather skills that will help me survive in the real world, 
regardless of how well I do academically.

I hope to continue improve as a human, and I hope to truly 

excel in something someday. But for now, I am average. And 
for the time of life that I’m in, average is quite all right.

living in the right neighborhood — people are suddenly into 
paying $20 for the privilege of eating artisanal toast, because 
that’s what’s trending. In other words, people associate 
hipsters with having no kind of original, meaningful or 
personal relationship to culture.”

Indeed, to Gunckel, as well as a set of left-leaning 

intellectuals, the mythic aura of authenticity surrounding 
the hipster masks the real damage: “I think the close 
association of the hipster with the creative economy 
obscures the detrimental economic shifts that gentrification 
is having in certain cities. Equating this demographic with 
‘hipness’ is a way of foregrounding that supposed dimension 

of the category, without owning up to their privilege and 
the role many of us — hipster or otherwise — may have in 
gentrification.”

Abandoning the territory of mainstream consumerism, 

hipsters are free to wander wherever they please, led only 
by a cultivated taste, a deep wallet, and, yes, the rigid norms 
of a class structure. Perhaps our Ann Arbor hipster is really 
just our existentialist tastemaker, choosing to choose in the 
daunting face of late-capitalist society. Sartre condemned 
man to freedom, but for the hipster set loose in the culinary 
garden of Ann Arbor, this is a delightful possibility.


Wednesday, September 30, 2015 // The Statement
8B

This past summer I was lucky enough to receive photo passes to a handful concerts 

around Ann Arbor. Never did I think I would be so fortunate to photograph Mumford 
& Sons, a band I have loved since their first album. For some of the concerts I’ve 
photographed I’m a fan of the band, while others I might just know a couple songs. With 
Mumford & Sons, I knew every lyric to every song they played.

When the band first came out, I was enthralled. Here was a group that I had loved for 

years, standing no more than a few feet from me. After the initial excitement subsided, 
I kicked into photographer mode, because I’m not just there to enjoy the concert but to 
make something of it too. This is where the allure of photographing your favorite band 
begins to fade. Because while I remember singing along to the chorus of “Snake Eyes” as 
I took the last of my photos, I can hardly remember what it was like listening to the two 
songs they played previously. 

When you’re a part of the audience, you can simply enjoy the show. When you 

photograph a concert, you are constantly on watch for the opportunity to take that perfect 
shot. It’s like you’re in a state of zen, where you block out everything happening around 
you and solely focus on what coming through your lens. This is encouraged by the “three 
song rule” which limits photographers to only shoot the first three songs the band plays, 
adding even more pressure to take great photos. So after Mumford & Sons play “Lovers’ 
Eyes,” “I Will Wait,” and “Snake Eyes,” I am escorted out of the photo pit and I make my 
way to the back of the venue to watch the rest of the show.
