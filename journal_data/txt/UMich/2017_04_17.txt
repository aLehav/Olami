Rallygoers hoisting signs above 

their heads stating, “Make Ethics 
Great Again” and “We Want Our 
Future Back,” marched Saturday 
afternoon through the sidewalks 
of downtown Ann Arbor while 
participating in a Tax March as 
the final hours for the deadline 
to file for federal and state taxes 
approach.

Ann 
Arbor’s 
Tax 
March, 

organized 
by 
Progressives 
at 

the University of Michigan and 
Michigan To Believe In, a subset 
of 
Bernie 
Sanders’s 
national 

movement, 
“Our 
Revolution,” 

was just one part in the series 
of marches occurring around 
the world on national Tax Day 
with more than 44 states and 
five countries getting involved to 
demand that President Donald 
Trump release his tax returns 
over 
concerns 
of 
financial 

entanglements and conflicts of 
interest. A larger march was held 
in Washington, D.C. at the Lincoln 
Memorial. 

The local march was followed 

by a rally on the University of 
Michigan Diag with speeches 
by U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–
Mich.), members of Michigan’s 
House of Representatives and

Following the election and 

subsequent 
inauguration 
of 

President Donald Trump, the 
liberal-leaning 
campus 
has 

seen several politically charged 
protests varying from small 
vigils to large marches, attracting 
thousands to the Diag this year.

While the political atmosphere 

directly following the election 
on campus was extremely active, 
there has appeared to be a drop 
in the number of demonstrations, 
something 
that 
postdoctoral 

fellow Austin McCoy said could 
be due to the fact that there 
haven’t been as many directly 
instigating causes as of late.

“We haven’t really seen any 

precipitating causes that have 
galvanized people,” McCoy said. 
“Even if people disagree with a lot 
of the administration’s policies, 
they (the Trump administration) 
haven’t done anything that has 
provoked a massive response.”

McCoy, 
who 
has 
worked 

with the Black Lives Matter 
and Collective Against White 

Supremacy movements in Ann 
Arbor, also said he believes part of 
the drop-off could be the natural 
cycle of the school year as people 
are preoccupied with exams and 
deadlines.

“I think part of it is the rhythm 

of the school year; obviously, 
we’re coming to the end of the 
semester and folks are more 

busy,” McCoy said.

McCoy said he thinks people 

were more prone to protest 
directly after the election as a 
response to the anger and fear 
they might have been feeling, 
but now he said he thinks a lot 
of longer-term organizing is 
happening.

“There are some people who 

said they weren’t surprised, but 
there might have been a lot of 
collective shock and that sort of 
drove people to organize, because 
people felt like they wanted to do 
something,” McCoy said. “It was 
sort of a short-term response, go 
out protest, voice your anger voice 
your fears — now I think what’s 

After 
months 
of 
winter, 

warm weather finally began 
to emerge, music could be 
heard throughout campus and 
students delayed studying for 
exams to watch performances 
with up-and-coming bands and 
artists, try new food trucks 
and participate in a number 
of activities led by student 
organizations.

SpringFest, 
the 
sixth 

annual festival held on North 
University Avenue and Ingalls 
Mall, drew in a crowd of over 
3,000 on Friday and showcased

Desiigner, 2 Chainz and Lil Yachty headline marquis for annual SpringFest charity concert

Hip-hop artists 2 Chainz, Lil 

Yachty and Desiigner finished off 
2017’s SpringFest to an enthusiastic 
student crowd Friday night at 
the Crisler Center. The trio’s 
performance marked the first 
student-run concert at the Crisler 
Center in 15 years when Phish 

performed thanks to a newly 
minted 
partnership 
between 

MUSIC Matters and Universal 
Music Group.

Hosted by MUSIC Matters, the 

trio’s 
performances 
concluded 

a day-long series of eventsand 
activities that took place on the 
Diag and North University Avenue. 
Throughout the day, attendees 
enjoyed performances from local 
bands Shmongo and The Stellars, 

along with UMG-affiliated artists 
Ocean Park Standoff, Nightly and 
Saint Mesa. Other events included 
music industry-oriented panels 
hosted by UMG, yoga classes, an 
MTank-led pitch competition and 
a rap cypher hosted by Hip Hop 
Congress.

Desiigner 
opened 
the 
later 

concert in bombastic fashion, 
climbing the stage and chaotically 
jumping into the crowd throughout 

his performance. He performed 
recently released singles “Up” and 
“Thank God I Got It,” while also 
touting his hit triple-platinum 
song “Panda” later on in his 
performance.

The atmosphere marked from 

the beginning remained constant 
as Lil Yachty took the stage, with 
the artist running through notable 
hits such as “Broccoli” and “Shoot 
Out The Roof” while jumping 

around throughout Crisler’s lower 
bowl for much of his set.

In an interview after the concert, 

Lil Yachty lauded the fervent 
energy of Crisler throughout the 
entirety of the show.

“I love Michigan, seriously,” 

Yachty said. “It’s amazing. It’s cold, 
but the vibes are dope and there’s a 
lot of positive energy.”

If you click past the home page 

of popular pornography website 

Pornhub, an entirely different 

image of the company appears. The 

webpage, titled Pornhub Cares and 

adorned with a little heart-shaped 

icon, is the new side of Pornhub that 

recently gave a $25,000 scholarship 

to University of Michigan graduate 

student Natalie Nevarez, according 

to the Washington Post. 

“Pornhub works hard to make 

millions of people happy every 

single day,” the website reads. “This 

is no easy feat and we couldn’t do 

it without some of the awesome 

women on our team of developers, 

engineers and analysts. We do, 

however, recognize that women are 

vastly underrepresented in tech, 

with the latest diversity reports 

estimating that women are filling as 

little as just 20-30% of positions in 

the field.”

The application involved 

an essay and an optional video 

to discuss the type of work an 

applicant does. Pornhub Vice 

President Corey Price said in a 

statement that Nevarez, who is 

finishing her Ph.D. in biopsychology, 

was a perfect choice for the award.

“We wanted to do our part 

in not only recognizing women’s 

outstanding accomplishments in 

the STEM fields, but also encourage 

them to continue to achieve 

both their academic and societal 

aspirations and make the world 

around us a better place,” Price 

said. “Natalie embodies everything 

we were looking for and more. Her 

academic achievements in STEM 

really stood out to us as did her 

inspiring personal story to give back 

and provide for her community.”

This is the second year the 

scholarship has been offered. It was 

announced to Nevarez she won the 

award via video chat with Pornhub 

Aria, a pornstar and spokeswoman 

for the website.

Nevarez told the Daily she was 

thrilled to learn she won the award.

“To me, it really is for paying off 

debt and being able to move to a new 

city,” Nevarez said. “I know it will 

improve my quality of life and it’s 

really going to help.”

As the daughter of migrant 

farmers, Nevarez grew up moving 

around California and Arizona 

every six months so her 

parents could follow 

the seasonal crops. She 

knew she didn’t want 

that kind of life for 

herself, and looked to 

education as a way out.

“I basically just saw 

an education as a way to 

get out of that lifestyle,” 

she said. “Neither of my 

parents had finished 

elementary school, so 

I knew that was a big 

contributor to why we 

had the lifestyle we had. 

… (Migrant work) is a 

lifestyle that really takes 

your parents away from 

you and I didn’t want 

that.”

Since then, her 

educational journey has taken 

her down many different paths.

Stephen Kunselman, a former 

City Council member from 2006 
to 2008 and from 2009 to 2015, 
has declared his intent to seek 
the Democratic Party nomination 
for a council seat currently held 
by 
Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman (D–Ward 3).

Kunselman, who is currently 

an energy conservation liaison for 

the University of Michigan, said 
he intends to submit nominating 
petitions 
with 
the 
required 

number of valid signatures early 
this week. Kunselman lost in the 
August 2015 Democratic primary 
to Ackerman and lost the August 
2008 primary to the current 
mayor, Christopher Taylor.

“Having served 4 terms for 8 

years on City Council, I am proud 
of the many campaigns that I have 
won, and lost, in the 7 campaigns 
I have participated in since 2006,” 

Kunselman wrote to the Daily. “I 
am happy to do my part to ensure 
the visions and positions of our 
elected officials get the electoral 
scrutiny they deserve.”

Kunselman 
named 
several 

reasons for running, chief among 
them his opposition to the Core 
Spaces building proposal, the 
closure of the city’s material 
recovery facility and the city’s 
redaction 
of 
communications 

with 
the 
Federal 
Railroad 

Administration regarding a new 

Amtrak station.

“I hadn’t anticipated running 

again, but it became increasingly 
clear 
after 
talking 
with 

downtown 
business 
owners, 

neighbors 
and 
supporters, 

that our City government is 
going in the wrong direction,” 
Kunselman wrote.

In an email with the Daily, 

Dave Askins, the former editor of 
the Ann Arbor Chronicle, wrote 
Kunselman’s run will bring more 
diversity and competition to the 
race.

Kunselman’s 
entry 
will 

also 
raise 
the 
number 
of 

contested elections this year 
to three, including in Ward 5 
incumbent Chip Smith versus 
David Silkworth, and Ward 4 
incumbent Jack Eaton versus 
Jaime Magiera.

Askins pointed out that each 

candidate’s victory is contingent 
on 
how 
much 
they 
could 

energize their voter base. The 
2015 primary was a close race, 
with Ackerman winning by 40 
votes.

“If neither Ackerman nor 

Kunselman can get a large set 
of a new kind of voter to go to 
the polls in August, then the 
outcome will likely again depend 
on the ability of those candidates 
to motivate their existing loyal 
supporters,” 
Askins 
wrote. 

“Those supporters have a clear 
geographic 
distribution 
– 

Ackerman has stronger support 
in the Burns Park area of the 
ward nearer downtown, and 
Kunselman 
enjoys 
greater 

support in the parts of the ward 
farther from downtown.”

a University Law professor all 
urging for the release of Trump’s 
taxes and speaking out against 
the detrimental effects of the cuts 
made to various government-
funded 
organizations 
and 

programs under Trump’s budget 
proposal.

During her speech, Dingell 

addressed the current propositions 
made by Republican leaders and 
Trump to refocus on tax cuts and 
reform amid the recent failures 
to repeal the Affordable Care Act, 
stating the results of these ideas 
will directly affect working and 
middle-class Americans.

“It’s gotten so bad that we now 

have to fight to preserve Meals on 
Wheels,” Dingell said.

She went on further to decry 

the recent increase of military 
spending under Trump’s new 
budget — a total of $54 billion — 
stating the need to prioritize the 
immediate 
concerns 
affecting 

American 
citizens 
before 

expanding the U.S. armed forces.

“Schools not bombs,” Dingell 

said. “We’ve got to take care of our 
own citizens before we increase 
the 
world’s 
largest 
defense 

budget.”

University Law professor Eli 

Savit, who currently serves as 
senior adviser to Detroit Mayor 
Mike Duggan, discussed how the 
deteriorating building conditions 
of the Detroit public school system 
are the results of the influence 
corporations and billionaires have 
on altering politics.

“You see, Michigan, unlike 

every other state virtually in 
the United States, doesn’t pay a 
single dime towards public school 
maintenance,” Savit said. “It comes 
back to money and politics. The 
rich, the corporations, millionaires 
and billionaires, they can bundle 
money for legislatures, they can 
start pacts, they can influence 
elections, and we don’t even get to 
know who’s behind them.” 

Ypsilanti resident Lani Chisnell, 

who marched and attended the 
rally, discussed how the Trump’s 
decision to not release his tax 

returns is only one of the many 
things she believes is wrong with 
the president.

“The taxes, it’s just a piece of a 

larger puzzle, it’s just a piece of a 
larger problem,” Chisnell said.

She discussed how organizing 

marches like the Tax March 
will be the most effective way 
of continuing the momentum 
of 
creating 
change 
in 
the 

government.

“I think we have to keep 

showing up, we have to keep 
trying, we have to keep pushing, 
and I think everything little thing 
we can do, we have to try and do 
it. If we can get any sort of traction 
with this, I think it’s important.”

New Hudson resident Adam 

Belcher, who served in the 82nd 
Airborne Division of the U.S. 
military in Afghanistan during 
2009, discussed why he felt 
compelled to attend the Tax March 
in Ann Arbor after choosing to not 
voting in the 2016 presidential 
election.

bring innovative and exciting 
musical performances to the 
University of Michigan and 
give back to the community 
through sustainability. 

Booths and displays at the 

event 
exhibited 
emerging 

ideas, products and works of 
art across the disciplines of 
the 
arts, 
entrepreneurship 

and sustainability. The event 
concluded with a nighttime 
concert featuring performers 
Desiigner, Lil Yachty and 2 
Chainz.

Representatives 
from 

the Universal Music Group, 
the 
nation’s 
leading 
music 

production 
company, 
were 

also in attendance. In years 
past, 
UMG 
has 
supported 

the organization by sending 
artists to perform, but this year 
decided to send representatives 
from UMG to campus to host 
interviews and panels.

LSA senior Hannah Tanau, 

communications 
chair 
for 

MUSIC Matters, described how 
Sony, another supporter of the 
festival, and UMG recognized 
summer music festivals cater 
to college-aged students, but 
there aren’t similar events on 
college campuses.

“The 
summer 
festival 

business is really saturated,” 
Tanau said. “There’s so many, 
and they’re not on college 
campuses, so (UMG and Sony) 
saw what we were doing at 
Michigan and thought it was 
really innovative and not being 
done anywhere else, so they 
wanted to come and add on to 
what we had here, and they’re 
hoping to take that and expand 
it across all Big Ten schools.”

Tanau 
also 
mentioned, 

unlike in the fall semester, 
when 
students 
can 
take 

advantage of the numerous 
campus-wide activities such 
as football games, there aren’t 
many 
traditions 
or 
events 

for students to participate in 
during the winter term.

“We feel like in the fall, 

we have events like Football 
Saturdays where everyone can 
come together and unite over 
school spirit, but in the spring 
there isn’t really any event like 
that,” Tanau said. “There’s 
so many people here and 
everyone has so many different 
passions and everyone is really 
involved in their own world 
during the year and there isn’t 

anywhere they can showcase 
that and share that with the 
rest of campus, so we really 
created SpringFest to unite our 
campus, show people what they 
care about.”

One of the most popular tents 

was the Sound Lounge, which 
was run by Sony and UMG. The 
tent hosted a variety of disc 
jockeys and panels with people 
who are part of the music 
industry. The up-and-coming 
band Ocean Park Standoff was 
part of the first panel, along 
with Cynthia Sexton, the UMG 
executive vice president of 
partnerships and content. The 
panel discussed the industry 
and the ways bands interact 
with the people behind the 
scenes.

Samantha Ronson, a member 

of Ocean Park Standoff, one 
of the music performances 
during the day, discussed the 
importance of one’s dedication 
to 
their 
work, 
especially 

in music management. She 
advised students who aspire 
to become musicians to find 
people who want to succeed 
just as much as they do to 
support them.

“I have had all the best 

managers and fired all of them, 
because most managers don’t 
actually want to work,” Ronson 
said. “They just want to take a 
check. If I could give any advice 
to up and coming people, it 
would be this: I’ve had every 
big manager you could have. 
Don’t get that guy. Get the guy 
who is going to wake up in the 
morning and think about you 
first. You want a hustler. You 
want someone who believes in 
you.”

Members of the band also 

talked about how much work 
has to be done in order to even 
get a song on the radio, let alone 
make it big. Lead singer Ethan 
Thompson said the amount of 
work has given him a whole 
new appreciation for all artists.

“It’s a lot of work that has 

made me respect so many 
artists that have made it to the 
top,” Thompson said. “Even the 
superstars are still hustling on 
a day-to-day basis.”

Todd 
Goodwin, 
vice 

president 
of 
college 
and 

lifestyle marketing at UMG, led 
an interview with University 
students about the rebirth in 
popularity of vinyl records 
in the Sound Lounge and 
discussed where he sees the 
future of the industry heading 
with younger audiences.

Goodwin 
stressed 
music 

could 
be 
shared 
through 

experience 
and 
through 

events like SpringFest at the 
University.

“I just got to a point where 

I wanted to do something 
different with how record labels 
specifically reach out to college 
students,” Goodwin said. “I 
feel that it’s so important you 
connect with people through 
experiences and not handing 
them products or selling them 
product, because at the end of 
the day you’re selling art and 
it’s someone’s passion project 
who 
put 
blood 
and 
tears 

into that. You don’t want to 
dissociate that, and what better 
way to bring that to people than 
through experiences.”

Goodwin also discussed how 

he wanted to make the event 
“college-centric” by bringing 
in 
college 
students 
from 

around the country who work 
for UMG, instead of people 
who have 15 to 20 years in the 
industry, to remain true to the 
festival.

“They’re doing all the work 

that you’d normally get a 
professional crew to do and 
they’re doing it because they 
love music and being a part of 
something that is inherently 
for them,” he said.

LSA 
junior 
Pratik 
Joshi 

enjoyed much of what the 
event had to offer, from the 
startup tent to the food trucks, 
appreciating how it brought the 
community together.

“I think it’s really good for 

just getting students engaged 
on campus, in that we get a 
chance to really explore some of 
the things we have to offer and 
it kind of allows us to connect 
with the outside community, 
like with the Detroit Barbeque 
place, we have a chance to see 
cool startups that we might not 
have heard about,” Joshi said.

Similarly, Music, Theatre & 

Dance freshman Cassie Nielsen 
came to SpringFest to see her 
friend’s band perform, but 
got to experience other parts 
of the event, such as the food 
trucks and some of the student 
startups.

“It brings a lot of the people 

from the school to the Diag, and 
you see a lot of the things people 
have been working on — like 
bands and everything — that 
are on campus,” Nielsen said. 
“So I think it’s interesting.”

going on is you (have) a lot of long-
term organizing.”

Immediately 
after 
Trump’s 

election there were a number of 
marches on campus, including one 
led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, while 
after the inauguration the Ann 
Arbor Women’s March attracted 
about 3,000 people in the Diag.

McCoy said he sees groups 

on campus now concerned more 
with striving to make the campus 
culture 
more 
inclusive 
and 

then will protest as a response 
if something bad comes out of 
Washington.

“A lot of the student groups 

here 
seem 
to 
be 
concerned 

with changing campus culture 
and campus policies here, and 
when they perceive something 
bad to happen that comes from 
Washington, then there will be a 
protest,” McCoy said.

LSA junior Rowan Conybeare, 

the 
chair 
of 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan’s 
chapter 
of 

College 
Democrats, 
personally 

participated 
in 
the 
Women’s 

March and said she feels the 
excitement may have died down a 
bit, but thinks the desire to resist 
Trump’s policies is still strong.

“President Trump has done a 

ton of awful things already and 
he hasn’t even been in office 100 
days, and I’m worried that it could 
become a feeling of normalcy,” 
Conybeare said. “That’s another 
one of the goals of College Dems 
is to make sure we know and 
students know that this is not ok, 
even if things continue to happen.”

In 
a 
similar 
vein, 
LSA 

sophomore 
Brad 
McPherson, 

a co-founder of Progressives at 
the University of Michigan, said 
he doesn’t think a drop in the 

number of protests implies people 
are becoming complacent to the 
administration.

“I don’t think that the drop off 

in numbers implies a drop off in 
enthusiasm,” 
McPherson 
said. 

“Protests in general are a really 
good message because they show 
the president that people are still 
very concerned about what he’s 
doing in office.”

Conversely, students on the 

other side of the political aisle, such 
as LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 
the president of the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans, 
said he thinks a lot of the liberal 
protests on campus can somewhat 
undermine the left’s goals by 
desensitizing people to issues.

“It’s kind of an issue of the boy 

who cried wolf; you have all of 
these protests where these liberals 
are 
accomplishing 
absolutely 

nothing except desensitizing the 
call to their own goals,” Zalamea 
said. “If you have a protest all the 
time — which is what they’re doing 
— it kind of defeats the whole 
purpose of drawing attention to 
one particular goal.”

Additionally, 
Zalamea 
said 

he thinks some of the protests 
were actually contradictory in 
nature, such as when Democratic 
organizers 
claim 
to 
support 

both low-income manufacturing 
workers 
and 
extreme 

environmental regulations.

“In fact, that’s probably one 

of the reasons the Democratic 
Party is having such a hard time 
of retaining members — is because 
they have so many hypocritical 
arguments,” Zalamea said. “That 
conflict of interest is very common 
among liberals and the Democratic 
Party in general.”

Thinking toward the future, 

Conybeare also said that while 
protesting 
and 
marching 
is 

impactful, she believes it will not 

directly translate into political 
success 
unless 
people 
follow 

through.

“I also think we can go further 

than just protests; they are super 
impactful and create a ton of 
excitement, but there’s more,” 
Conybeare said. “Protests aren’t 
going to get Democrats elected, 
so we need to continue knocking 
doors and canvassing and talking 
to students.”

Speaking about the upcoming 

Michigan gubernatorial race as 
an example, Conybeare said just 
because there appears to be a 
lot of resistance to Republicans, 
Democrats cannot just assume 
they will win office.

“Even after what Governor 

Snyder did to the people of Flint, 
Democrats cannot just assume it’s 
ours,” Conybeare said. “As a party, 
we need to be careful not to take it 
for granted, but I think it can give 
momentum in the long run.”

McPherson 
predicted 
there 

will be another uptick in protests 
as midterm elections approach 
because of the unpopularity of 
Congress and Trump.

“I think as we get closer to 

midterm elections we’re going to 
see another ramp up of protests 
in general as people express their 
discontent,” McPherson said.

Addressing 
the 
lack 
of 

organized protests by conservative 
students on campus, Zalamea 
said he thinks it is the result of a 
currently a unified Republican 
government, but also believes 
liberal college students are more 
prone to protest. 

“Maybe it just boils down to the 

progressive left’s methodology, 
when something upsets them I 
guess their go-to thing is to just 
protest about it,” Zalamea said. 
“Whereas 
with 
conservatives 

you see discontent mainly just 
resulting in action right away.”

on campus, 2 Chainz closed the 
night. Last performing at the Hill 
Auditorium for SpringFest in 2014, 
2 Chainz opened his performance 
with an energetic performance of 
Drake collaboration “All Me.”

Students in attendance were 

largely impressed with the artists’ 
energy onstage throughout the 
concert, in addition to Desiigner 
and 
Lil 
Yachty’s 
constant 

interactions with the crowd during 
their performances. Engineering 
junior Madhav Sharma said he 

thought the energy the artists 
brought made the concert engaging 
throughout the night.

“I was on my feet the whole 

time,” he said. “Even though their 
sets weren’t terribly long, all three 
artists made up for that by keeping 
their 
performances 
constantly 

engaging.”

LSA senior Alex Bedard praised 

the energy of the stadium.

“The atmosphere of the show 

was amazing,” he said. “The Crisler 
Center was a better venue than 
I had ever anticipated, and the 
headliners definitely brought their 
best.”

As a part of MUSIC Matters’s 

initiatives, proceeds from the 

night concert’s gate receipts will go 
toward a summer camp for Detroit 
youth. The camp, set to occur this 
coming summer, will be hosted at 
the University and will involve a 
variety of workshops and classes 
meant to promote arts, culture and 
higher education.

In addition to hosting the 

summer camp, MUSIC Matters’s 
latest SpringFest will serve as a 
blueprint for similar college music 
festivals to be hosted across the 
country by UMG. With the two 
organizations’ partnership being 
the first of its kind, UMG plans on 
bringing a similar festival model to 
multiple other college campuses in 
the coming years.

Rosenthal 
— 
hypothesized 

Saudi Arabia and Iran have 
intentionally escalated the civil 
war in order to deter each other’s 
regional influence.

They evaluated each country 

on three variables: increased 
militarization, 
socio-religious 

conflicts 
and 
financing. 

Evaluation 
of 
these 
factors 

confirmed the Syrian civil war 
is one of many proxy conflicts 
between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

William 
Woods, 
an 
LSA 

and Music, Theatre & Dance 
international exchange student, 
appreciated 
the 
project’s 

relevance and perspective.

“I was interested in the thing 

about Saudi Arabia and Iran’s 
support of the Syrian civil war, 
but that’s because it’s on the news 
all the time,” he said. “I always 
want to know what people’s 
takes are on it, or what kind of 
information is covered in it.”

Engineering 
freshman 

Mackenzie Abele, LSA freshmen 
Brielle 
Bonetti 
and 
Medha 

Krishen and LSA junior Kawthar 
Mohamud 
investigated 
the 

effects of international laws 
and policies in regard to child 
soldiers.

They 
used 
case 
studies 

from three different regions 
that had implemented laws to 
prohibit the use of child soldiers: 
Afghanistan, 
the 
Democratic 

Republic of the Congo and 
Myanmar. 
Their 
hypothesis 

proposed these laws aimed at 
demobilizing and reintegrating 
child soldiers back into society 
were not being implemented 
effectively.

Through their analysis, they 

found significant decreases in 
the proliferation of child soldiers, 
but suggested all three nations 

would benefit from improved 
education. Their results led them 
to believe, given the complex 
political environments in these 
regions, involvement of outside 
actors would soon be necessary.

“Countries have been taking 

steps which is a completely 
different 
thing 
than 
they 

would have done 50 years ago,” 
Mohamud said. “We have to look 
towards the optimism of the 
future.”

One project directly discussed 

the Trump administration.

LSA 
sophomores 
A’ndre 

Gonawela, Michael Roth Jr. 
and William Solmssen and LSA 
freshman Corrina Lee wanted 
to understand the implications 
of President Trump’s plan to 
diminish the U.S. trade deficit 
with Mexico by imposing a tariff 
on Mexican imports.

They explored the effects of 

likely protectionist trade policies 
under the Trump administration 
through 
an 
analysis 
of 
10 

historical 
U.S. 
tariffs. 
They 

concluded the tariff could be 
detrimental, and could result 
in losses in political capital, 
retaliatory tariffs and rising 
consumer prices.

The fourth project covered 

the environmental policies of 
countries in the South China 
Sea. LSA junior Riley Plamp, LSA 
sophomore Nicholas Ranger and 
Engineering junior Ravi Shah 
created a graded scale to evaluate 
each country: China, Vietnam, 
Indonesia and the Philippines.

Their average score was better 

than they anticipated, though 
the Philippines was the only 
country with a positive net score. 
They suggested that innovative 
methods of prevention in the 
Philippines 
helped 
them 
to 

achieve this score. 

“One of the more interesting 

policies that they implemented 
was they put religious statues 
underwater to try to stop blast 

fishing so it would make people 
not want to detonate bombs 
underwater for fear of blowing 
up the statues,” Plamp said.

LSA freshmen Jonah Klausner 

and Sebastian Leder Macek, LSA 
sophomore Alexandrea Somers 
and Engineering student Yifan 
Yu investigated how transitions 
from closed economies to open 
economies 
affect 
education 

levels and income inequality.

They 
hypothesized 
the 

transitions in Vietnam, Egypt, 
Poland 
and 
Namibia 
would 

show improved education and 
increased 
income 
inequality. 

The group found openness in 
trade weakly correlated to better 
primary education and strongly 
correlated to better secondary 
and 
tertiary 
education. 

Furthermore, income inequality 
generally increased but might 
not be sustained in the future.

“When countries open up to 

trade, there are policies they can 
implement to soften the blow, to 
mitigate the income inequality 
that can come with opening 
to trade,” Klausner said. “If a 
government were to get their 
hands on our journal, they might 
know that sponsoring vocational 
training for folks with lower 
income can help.”

The final project by LSA 

sophomore Anna Haynes and 
LSA freshman Martha Abrams 
were motivated by common 
speculations 
claiming 
the 

Georgian invasion of 2008 and 
the Ukrainian invasion of 2014 
are linked.

They sought to analyze the 

similarities 
in 
Russian 
war 

crimes across conflicts. The case 
studies of Georgia and Ukraine 
suggested war crimes committed 
by Russians are significantly 
similar. 
These 
findings, 
the 

presenters argued, could help 
inform policy and strategy for 
international 
intervention 
in 

future crises.

T

he end of the semester 
is a hectic time. If 
there’s 
anything 

indicative of this, it’s the fact 
that I’m writing this 
column in the notes 
app on my phone as 
I walk to my next 
class. 
Whether 

April 
is 
plagued 

with exams, papers, 
projects, internship 
searches 
or 
good 

old-fashioned 
showers, 
this 

month is incredibly 
stressful. I myself 
have been struggling 
with balancing my finals and 
pre-final exams — don’t ask 
— so I asked myself what I 
would want to read if I were 
procrastinating 
studying, 

on the verge of tears or 
both. I decided I wanted to 
read something interesting, 
unrelated 
to 
school 
and 

something happy or funny. 
So, in this column, I’ll be 
discussing some good news. 

Researchers 
from 
the 

University of California at 
Berkeley have discovered the 
mystery as to why shoelaces 
come untied. Apparently “the 
force of your foot striking 
the ground and the motion 
of your leg combine to help 
loosen and ultimately untie 
the knot,” colloquially known 
as “walking,” unties shoes. 
Even more insightful, the 
orientation of the bow itself 
is important — horizontal and 
even bows are better than 
uneven bows. I personally 
never learned how to tie my 
own shoes correctly, so I’m 
using this incredibly scientific 
information to aid me in 
my quest to loop the bunny 
around the tree.

In 
the 
age 
of 
internet 

phenomena, 
wholesome 

content can be hard to find. 
Fear not! If you have access to 
the internet, it’s likely you’ve 
heard of April the giraffe and 
her drawn-out, livestreamed 
pregnancy. 
Though 
some 

questioned the morality of 
livestreaming a giraffe’s birth, 
hundreds of thousands were 
fascinated, and a few delved 
into the ethics of animal 
privacy. Day after day, people 

waited impatiently in front 
of their computers to watch a 
giraffe give birth live on the 
internet. Well, the wait is over. 

After an absurdly 
long period of time, 
April 
gave 
birth 

to an infant male 
giraffe on April 15 
at 
approximately 

9:55 a.m.

I’m not a huge 

sports 
fan, 
but 

I 
do 
like 
social 

justice. If you like 
either 
of 
these 

things you might 

be pleased to hear 

that 
the 
commissioner 
of 

Major 
League 
Baseball, 

Rob Manfred, has recently 
expressed sentiments for the 
Cleveland Indians to move 
away from its team logo. The 
current logo, which features 
a stereotypical depiction of 
what is meant to be a Native 
American, has been the subject 
of significant controversy. The 
Cleveland team ironically calls 
Progressive Field its home, so 
perhaps its field’s name will 
inspire it to distance itself 
from the logo.

Feeling hopeless about the 

political scene? Feeling sad 
that no one is offering you an 
unpaid 
political 
internship 

in Washington, D.C.? Fond of 
astronomy? If you answered 
yes to any of the previous 
questions, 
you’re 
in 
luck! 

Scientists at NASA are saying 
that Jupiter’s moon Europa or 
Saturn’s moon Enceladus may 
be our best bets for nearby 
habitable locations. Enceladus 
in particular has potential, as 
signs are suggesting that the 
key ingredients necessary for 
inhabitation might be found 
there. The recent discovery of 
hydrogen inside Enceladus has 
caused much excitement within 
the scientific community, and 
there’s nothing purer than 
joyous scientists.

The Huffington Post has 

a 
section 
of 
their 
website 

dedicated to cute dog videos. 
This epitomizes good journalism 
in my humble opinion.

Good things are happening 

in 
our 
own 
backyard! 

University 
of 
Michigan 

undergraduate students have 

created 
an 
affordable 
and 

time-saving 
alternative 
to 

measuring hemostasis — or 
natural blood clotting abilities 
— in patients before they 
receive treatment. Timeliness 
is essential in medicine, and 
results 
must 
be 
accurate, 

understandable and quick so 
that medical professionals can 
make good decisions swiftly.

Margaret 
Atwood 
is 
a 

mystical, 
palm-reading 

spider enthusiast. She is also 
the author of more than 60 
published 
works, 
including 

“The 
Handmaid’s 
Tale,” 

which has recently regained 
popularity as a result of the 
current political climate. If 
you’re 
fond 
of 
mysterious 

old women and you haven’t 
run out of free articles from 
the New Yorker, I highly 
encourage you to read their 
profile on Atwood.

It’s easy to get caught up in 

finals, and even easier to get 
caught up in the hype that 
surrounds negative political, 
economic 
or 
environmental 

news. These stories are handed 
to us, appear often on our 
Facebook newsfeeds and are 
shared quickly — often with 
commentary on Twitter. When 
I started my search for pieces of 
news to include in this column, 
I had to look far and wide to 
find good news, not because 
there isn’t any, but because the 
striking taglines and clickbait 
get more attention, pushing 
positive stories to the bottom 
of the heap.

I don’t want to encourage 

people to avoid bad news. 
Being aware of the state of our 
nation and of the international 
plights occurring each day is 
vastly more important than 
protecting 
your 
feelings. 

Simultaneously, 
though, 

it can be easy to read only 
disheartening 
stories, 
tales 

of 
lying, 
cheating, 
murder 

or fraud. It’s imperative that 
we pay attention, but it’s 
equally important to see that 
virtues of kindness, respect 
and honesty are not entirely 
missing from the world.

M

y lack of flexibility, 
intense personality 
and 
acute 

alcoholism all contribute to 
my 
consistently 

pathetic 
performance in the 
yoga classes I have 
been taking. Every 
other day my body 
is subjected to a 
constant torment as 
I scream internally 
through 
the 

pretzel-like 
poses 

my 
all-too-calm 

instructor asks me 
to perform.

Surrounded by the healthy, 

flexible, 
barefoot 
individuals 

all breathing rhythmically to 
the 
tranquil 
nature 
sounds 

that substitute music, I often 
find myself wondering what in 
the name of good god did I do 
to my myself. I feel individual 
tendons being ripped apart to 
the soundtrack of wind chimes 
blowing in the Pacific Northwest.

For years I have subjected 

my body to athletic and aerobic 
punishments with no thought 
about the later ramifications. 
I never stretched. I lifted too 
many weights. I ran too many 
miles in a pair of shoes from 
President Obama’s first term. 
So, at the young and pathetic 
age of 21, I was already paying 
this minor physical price. Yet 
yoga, even as terrible as I am 
at it, has already made me 
feel somewhat better, more 
flexible and recharged when 
I start my day.

If only there were a way 

we could stretch and heal the 
mind, the same way we do 
with our bodies.

I am reminded every year 

with the arrival of Easter 
of 
my 
annual 
“sit-alone-

in-church-pew-and-think-
about-yourself” tradition. As 
a pseudo-Catholic, I venture 
home on this holiday to join 
my family for the most holy 
and central day of my religion. 
During this brief time, I 
force myself into a moment 
of pure mental reflection — 
and recently, I have not been 
content with what I find.

For here at this university, 

and in life in general, I often 
allow for the darker shades of 
my psyche to wage war upon 

the 
rational 
and 

calm 
elements 
of 

my mind. Jealousy, 
insecurity and envy 
can often consume 
me as I blindly and 
abusively 
pursue 

temporary goals in 
the hope of satisfying 
desires. Essentially, 
I don’t stretch, I 
do too much and, 
worse, 
I 
often 

lock myself away with these 
thoughts, never moving as I act 
as the audience to the ongoing 
war inside my mind between 
pessimism and optimism.

And I submit myself to 

this pathetic mental torment 
through multiple methods. I 
am jealous over the seemingly 
incredible lives of specific 
people, with their overbooked 
social scene and the constant 
attention 
directed 
toward 

them. I see what others have 
and then I just want. And 
these are all common emotions 
felt 
among 
every 
human 

being, yet I will amplify the 
severity of such desires with 
senseless quick fixes with 
lack of any true character 
building. I never take the time 
to understand my desires, I 
simply throw artificial things 
at them hoping they’ll work. 

Life cannot be sustained 

through 
knee-jerk 

satisfactions. 
Instead 
of 

actual character building and 
understanding one’s identity, 
I 
have 
lived 
before 
with 

makeshift qualities and traits 
pretending to be happy for a 
night. And yet each time that 
fails, I seem to never understand 
the lesson. Many times I have 
woken up unsatisfied with 
my life and have yet again 
submitted myself to blending 
into the anonymous crowd of 
the “haves” instead of the “have 
nots,” and I pretended that with 
the next bar, the next drink, the 
next hook up, I’ll satisfy that 
desire. I’ll feel complete.

These 
are 
the 
knee-

jerk 
mental 
reactions 
to 

our overall human desires. 
Life 
is 
distracting 
with 

money, 
sex 
and 
others’ 

perceived happiness, so it is 
understandable that we jump 
into these temporary artificial 
solutions to experience some 
capacity of joy.

With yoga, one lesson I 

have 
come 
to 
understand 

is that actually engaging in 
the stretches properly, one 
must totally relax into a state 
that is uniquely natural, free 
from outside distractions and 
worldly desires.

Though 
I 
am 
actually 

horrible at the physical aspects 
of yoga, I have succeeded in 
applying the mental aspects to 
my life in some respects. The 
time away from the seemingly 
endless 
social 
competition 

clears my head. The outside 
distractions, the artificiality, 
the 
temporary 
solutions 

are removed for a clearer 
perspective of what I want to 
get from life.

Life cannot be sustained 

on just temporary knee-jerk 
reactions to real goals in 
life. Cheap movements for 
easy, temporary results — not 
results that matter and last. 
Popularity, alcohol, drugs — 
nothing like this will sustain a 
person forever.

Yoga is hard.

O

n June 12, 2016, a 
gunman 
opened 

fire in Pulse, a gay 

nightclub in Orlando, Fla. 
50 people were killed and 
53 
others 
were 
wounded, 

marking 
the 
shooting 
as 

the greatest act of violence 
against LGBTQ individuals and 
the largest mass shooting by 
a single shooter in the history 
of the United States. While 
dozens of victims lay in need of 
blood, the LGBTQ community 
mobilized to help support them. 
Despite their best efforts, queer 
men were left helpless in their 
attempt to save the survivors 
of this tragedy — barred from 
donating blood. 

Why? Because they are gay.
In the 1980s, as a reaction 

to the HIV epidemic and its 
portrayal as a “gay man’s” 
disease, the Food and Drug 
Administration 
banned 
men 

who have had sex with men 
from donating blood. When the 
policy was first put into place, 
there was a lack of concrete 
medical 
information 
about 

HIV and AIDS, which led the 
medical community to believe 
HIV almost solely affected the 
gay community. Thus, it was 
deemed 
more 
important 
to 

ensure the safety of transfusion 
recipients 
than 
ensuring 

equality 
in 
donations. 
For 

this reason, a ban on gay men 
from donating blood seemed 
reasonable at the time. 

However, 
with 
modern 

medical science and a greater 
understanding of how HIV 
is spread, an updated policy 
is necessary. Though a 2010 
study found there is a higher 
prevalence of HIV within the 
gay community, heterosexual 
relationships account for 25 
percent of new HIV infections 
annually in the United States. 
Alternative 
risk 
assessment 

policies, rather than a ban on 
an entire group of individuals 
from blood donations, will allow 

more people to donate blood and 
also decrease the likelihood of 
transmitted infections.

Though this ban has been 

altered recently going from a 
lifetime deferral to the current 
one-year abstinence policy for 
gay men, the current policy is 
still rooted in discrimination. 
While changing the policy to 
a 
12-month 
deferral 
allows 

gay men to donate blood, it 
effectively 
functions 
as 
a 

lifetime ban for most of these 
men. It poses the underlying 
assumption that homosexual 
men 
are 
promiscuous 
and 

dirty, therefore increasing their 
likelihood of contracting HIV, 
regardless of the details of their 
respective sexual experiences.

Because 
of 
this 

discrimination, we propose a 
change in the FDA’s rules on 
how it determines eligibility for 
blood donation. Italy, since 2001, 
has utilized a system where 
blood donor eligibility is based 
on an individual risk assessment 
of sexual behaviors. With this 
policy change, deferment of 
donation could not be based 
upon sexual orientation, but 
was determined, in detailed 
interviews 
from 
medical 

professionals, 
by 
exposure 

to risk. In cases where risk is 
identified, donors are barred 
from donating for four months 

following the exposing event. 
Following this change, there 
was no increase in the amount 
of HIV-positive blood donors 
when comparing homosexual 
to 
heterosexual 
donors. 
As 

heterosexuals 
accounted 
for 

40 percent of HIV antibody-
positive cases in donors, this 
form of assessment not only 
eliminated the discriminatory 
policies 
toward 
homosexual 

men, 
but 
also 
prevented 

numerous 
heterosexual 

HIV-positive 
donors 
from 

contaminating the blood supply.

A study conducted by the 

Williams 
Institute 
at 
the 

University 
of 
California 
at 

Los Angeles School of Law 
calculated 
that 
lifting 
the 

ban would result in 360,600 
additional 
donors 
providing 

nearly 615,300 pints of blood 
each 
year. 
A 
2014 
article 

described how the Red Cross 
needs 80,000 units of blood a 
day, but only receives 36,000. 
Allowing donations from gay 
men who do not engage in 
risky behavior would help to 
minimize this shortage.

Luckily, there are ways each 

and every one of us can help. In 
February, a group of students 
put on a blood drive where 
straight allies donated blood 
in the name of gay people who 
were banned from donating. 
With the University of Michigan 
wrapping up its 200th year, 
there are many things to keep 
in mind. In those 200 years, 
the University of Michigan has 
been a constant hotbed of social 
change, and Michigan Medicine 
has been a pioneer within the 
medical field. If we truly are 
the Leaders and the Best, it 
is time for our community to 
take action to change the FDA’s 
discriminatory policy.

If only there was 
a way we could 
stretch and heal 

the mind, the 

same way we do 
with our bodies.

While changing 
the policy to a 

12-month deferral 

allows gay 

men to donate, 
it effectively 
functions as a 
lifetime ban.

HBO

The Leftovers returns tonight at 9 p.m.
‘The Leftovers’ presents 
a miraculous final season

HBO series returns for its third immaculate and visceral season

Think 
about 
endings. 

They’re necessary, of course, 
but suffocating. An ending 
is a constraint; scripts need 
third acts, series need finales. 
That’s the convention we’ve 
accepted, and it’s one we’ve 
adhered 
to, 
fastidiously. 

But to consider the thrilling 
possibility of ambiguity — that 
maybe not every event needs 
a logical conclusion, not every 
question needs an answer — 
is to entertain the taboo. Is a 
television show’s final season 
worthwhile if, by the end of 
it, some threads remain loose? 
Does a purposefully reticent 
final act render the entire 
journey, well, pointless?

Here’s the thing, though: 

“The 
Leftovers” 
is, 
in 

every 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 

art. And its final season is 
nothing short of stunning. 
It’s thrilling and ambitious, 
frustratingly 
brilliant 
and 

emotionally 
draining, 
an 

artistic achievement that both 
celebrates and challenges the 
medium in equal measure. 
With my sincere apologies to 
“The Americans,” “Veep” and 
“Fargo,” “The Leftovers” is 
unquestionably the best show 
on TV.

So, in short, no — I don’t 

really care to find out where 
everyone went on October 14. 
I’m more challenged by the 
innumerable 
new 
questions 

the 
series 
poses 
than 
its 

original, big one. And by all 
available accounts, so too is 
the 
show. 
Perhaps 
Damon 

Lindelof learned from “Lost” 
’s infamous firestorm of an 
ending. Maybe he, like Kevin 
(Justin Theroux, “The Girl On 
The Train”) in last season’s 
awe-inspiring 
“International 

Assassin, ” had to endure some 
sort of narrative purgatory 
to come out on the other side 
renewed, invigorated, ready to 
confront his demons.

This line of thinking, one 

of closure and acceptance, 
extends 
to 
the 
show’s 

characters, 
as 
well. 
Each 

principal character — from 
Kevin, who must now reconcile 
with his bizarre Messiah-like 
stature, to Matt (Christopher 
Eccleston, 
“Legend”), 
the 

preacher who seems constantly 
put-upon by his own God, to 
Nora 
(Carrie 
Coon, 
“Gone 

Girl”), from whom life seems 
to be constantly taking away, 
and without justification — is 
grappling with his/her own 
existential struggles. Just as 
the show’s creators deny us any 
form of concrete resolution, so 
too do the writers refuse to let 
their characters off the hook.

Since its first season, the 

principals on “The Leftovers” 
have been stuck in a world 
that now makes no sense, 
unforgiving 
and 
ultimately 

devoid 
of 
meaning, 
while 

everyone around them tries 
to continue their lives as 
normally as they can. Death, 
and dealing with its fallout, 
is comparatively easy; what 
do you do when there is no 
body to bury and no biological 
process as explanation? What 
is the point of grief, of trauma, 

of this condition of inherent 
dissatisfaction, when you will 
never find the answers you so 
desperately seek? There are no 
documented seven stages to 
squeeze yourself through, and 
“coping mechanisms” take on 
new meaning. In the show’s 
new season, we’re alternately 
treated to people suffocating 
themselves with plastic bags 
and slamming car doors on 
their own arms. 
It’s all bizarre, and 
it’s all just to feel 
something.

And if that reads 

as 
unbearably 

pretentious, don’t 
worry. Beginning 
with 
its 
second 

season (for what it’s worth, I 
still ride hard for the show’s 
oppressively depressing first 
season; never before has a 
season of television so actively 
explored and interrogated the 
notion of grief as a human 
necessity), Lindelof and his 
team have found increasingly 
creative ways to make the show 
unassumingly, darkly funny. 
The show laughs with you, 
skeptical viewer, whenever it 
gets the chance; its mastery 
of tone is utterly jaw-dropping 
and 
downright 
impressive. 

Lindelof is fond of his winking 
religious symbolism (the new 
season premieres on Easter, 
hilariously) and astoundingly 
complex imagery, sure, but 
there’s also a wordless, slow-
motion 
sequence 
featuring 

Regina 
King 
(“American 

Crime”) 
and 
Carrie 
Coon 

jumping on a trampoline set to 
Wu-Tang’s “Protect Ya Neck 
(The Jump Off),” and it’s one of 
the best things I’ve ever seen.

The 
third 
season 
of 

“The Leftovers” also revels 
in 
the 
second 
season’s 

radical 
narrative 
structure. 

Season two was so tightly, 
immaculately constructed that 
it seemed almost impossible to 
repeat, but season three proves 
no different. The POV switches 
and shifts in perspective still 
manage to work wonders here, 
and when characters get their 
own 
standalone 
episodes, 

they are, without fail, always 
incredible. 
The 
change 
in 

setting, too, provides another 
gorgeous visual backdrop for 
Lindelof’s searching narrative; 
Australia is a whole different 
beast than Texas, and the 
show produces a number of 
surprises here, from another 
stunning, 
season-opening 

vignette to the return of one 
of the series’ most mysterious 
characters, 
who 
transitions 

from 
the 
shadowy 
fringes 

of last season’s plot right to 
the center of our characters’ 
stories.

It seems as if there are 

too 
many 
“best 
on 
TV” 

designations to bestow upon 
“The Leftovers” in its final 
season: 
Coon’s 
consistently 

heartbreaking 
performance, 

Max 
Richter’s 
magnificent 

score (and Liza Richardson’s 
music 
supervision), 
Mimi 

Leder’s direction, Lindelof’s 
toying 
with 
narrative 

convention, etc. I could go 
on forever. But what remains 
“The Leftovers” ’s singular 
achievement, to me, is its 
ability to provoke some feeling 

within you.

It’s a visceral experience, 

watching this show. Whether 
you find it actively disturbing 
or wondrously liberating, it’s 
a series that is unafraid to 
grapple with big questions 
and uncomfortable ideas, in 
ways that elicit only the most 
buried of our emotions. It 
confounds, but it frees. It’s 
art that agitates; it’s television 

that 
actually 

tries, 
without 

pretense, 
to 

be 
something 

more. 
“The 

Leftovers” 
is 

not a bingeable 
experience. 
It’s 
not 

comfortable, and it takes time 
to digest. But what Lindelof 
and his team have crafted 
here, this inimitable artistic 
achievement, 
is 
impossible 

to ignore. However the show 
decides to conclude, whatever 
meaning we eventually derive 
from its thorny questions of 
religion and closure and the 
lies we tell ourselves to keep 
living, we can rest in knowing 
that the journey has been, 
without flaw, worth it.

TV REVIEW

Still from “After the Storm”
‘After the Storm’ a simple 
yet heartbreaking drama

Plain but stirring “Storm” presents a raw story of struggle 

“After the Storm” is a plain 

movie. It says what it means 
without flourish or affectation, 
tells its story with no stylistic 
embellishments and really, it’s 
all the better for it. Directed by 
Hirokazu Koreeda (“Our Little 
Sister”), “After the Storm” tells 
the story of Ryota (Hiroshi Abe, 
“Everest: Kamigami no Itadaki”), 
a struggling detective who is 
trying to relive his former glory 
as a prize-winning novelist. 
Ryota’s life is a bit of a mess: He 
can’t seem to stop himself from 
gambling away all his earnings, 
and he subsequently can’t pay 
for his young son’s childcare. 
His father has recently died, so 
he goes to visit his aging mother 
Yoshiko (Kirin Kiki, “Sweet 
Bean”) but Ryota’s sister suspects 
that he’s only trying to sponge off 
of her pension. Everybody likes 
him, but nobody quite trusts him.

The movie is a slow burn. 

We follow Ryota through the 
most mundane parts of his days, 
but this apparent slowness is 
deliberate and careful. We watch 
him buy a soda from the corner 
stone, meet with his detective 
partner to work on a case, go to 

the racetrack and lose all his 
day’s earnings. We watch him go 
back to his apartment, the rent 
for which he can rarely afford, 
and watch him go to sleep on a 
mattress on the floor. It’s all so 
deceptively casual, even when 
we see him meet with his son 
and ex-wife, and try and fail so 
hard at being a good and present 
father. Koreeda films it all exactly 
the same way, with 
no judgment or 
affectation. This is 
just the way things 
are, he seems to 
say.

Really, it’s the 

sharp writing that 
ties it all together. Koreeda’s 
script, like his direction, is highly 
realistic, with the characters 
speaking like actual people. 
It’s easy to forget it’s a movie 
at some points because of the 
earnest authenticity. That’s not 
to say that the story isn’t properly 
dramatized because it absolutely 
is. It’s just that there’s none of the 
flash or the spectacle we’re used 
to in family dramas.

The performances too are 

spectacular. In his portrayal of 
Ryota, Abe is simultaneously 
beaten down and hopeful. He 
can make the smallest action 
devastating with a slight shift in 

his eyes. There’s a heartbreaking 
vulnerability to his performance 
that permeates every scene, 
whether he’s shouting at the 
racetrack or sitting with his son 
in a playground. With every 
brilliant 
flashing 
smile, 
you 

can see exactly why Kyoko, his 
ex-wife (Yoko Maki, “The Lion 
Standing in the Wind”) fell for 
him, and why she ultimately left 

him.

Koreeda makes 

absolutely 
sure 

that we see the 
whole story, but he 
also never lingers 
too long over a 
given 
moment. 

It simply unfolds in real time, 
making the emotions hit that 
much harder. “After the Storm” 
is a slice of life drama, achingly 
realistic in its portrayal of family 
and expectations unmet.

It’s been a long time since 

I’ve seen a movie this gentle 
and careful. It never turns 
into a trite morality play or a 
melodrama. It has no cheap 
plot machinations or unearned 
emotional catharsis. It’s a lovely 
little film, unglamorous and 
unembellished. It is what it is, 
nothing more, nothing less — 
and that might just be why it’s so 
great.

DAILY MUSIC COLUMN

Uncertainty: Isn’t it great?

In her last column, Lo talks about music, pain & dancing through it

“It’s 
really 
interesting 
what 

happens when your passion is bigger 
than the tools you have to deal with 
it. It creates this energy that’s raw. 
Isn’t it great?”

 — Abbie Porter

That’s how Greta Gerwig’s 

character describes early punk 
band The Raincoats in Mike Mills’s 
“20th Century Women.” They’re 
not a pretty-sounding band, and 
they’re not talented either, but 
they’re not supposed to be. They 
want to be raw and passionate and 
energetic and always and forever 
stay that way.

The narrator says, when Abbie 

moved to New York, “She learned 
to dance when she got sad.” In 
her performance, Greta Gerwig 
dances to badass punk songs like 
a prototype of Molly Ringwald in 
“The Breakfast Club,” swinging 
her arms and bouncing off the 
ground with a furious yet elegant 
energy. I watch and I’m envious. 
I don’t recommend trying to copy 
her unless you really want to tire 
yourself out.

I can say that because I’ve tried 

to dance like Abbie, because I’ve 
turned my iPod up to full volume 
and blasted The Jam and The 
Clash and Talking Heads and 
other punk bands you can dance 
to and tried to let go of my feelings 
through their songs. I’ve done this 
before and after I’ve come out as 

trans. The night a long essay is 
due and the day after I turn it in. 
After a great night or a terrible 
night. It doesn’t matter. I think 
I’m always going to be doing this, 
turning to music against my better 
judgement to solve my problems, 
looking to dance my way through 
stress. I’ve tried to make Siouxsie 
Sioux or David Bowie and Byrne 
or The Menzingers or just any 
artist with strong enough vocals 
coupled with a decent bass line and 
aggressive enough guitar be my 
therapists.

It doesn’t work. Music never 

really heals you. I’ve known that, 
at least part of me has, ever since I 
tried to ease pubescent heartbreak 
in 9th grade with a Dashboard 
Confessional CD. I think there’s 

a slight loss of loneliness through 
the 
lyrics 
and 
vocals, 
some 

fulfillment in moving your body 
until it’s exhausted. But whatever 
freaks me out is always still there 
when the headphones get quiet 
again.

I like to think I’ve actually 

gotten mature enough that I 
don’t look to music to solve my 
problems. I pray, and I breathe 
and I try to break a situation 
down into manageable pieces. 
Sure, maybe I’ll put on The 
National, but only as background 
music while I work on whatever I 
need to. Music can calm me, and it 
can make me feel great for three-
to-seven minute at a time, but it 
can’t fix anything about me.

But I still need songs in order to 

connect with the rest of the world. 
The new Father John Misty 
record is about me and you. That 
new Kendrick you’re hearing? 
That’s about us, too. And Abbey 
Road. And 1989. Your favorite 
record is about me, whatever it 
may be. And I hope my favorite 
record is about you. The way I 
write and think and talk about 
these songs, I’m putting in all 
the emotions that I feel when I 
hear them, trying to show these 
artists to you with a piece of me 
still inside. It’s still the best way I 
know how to communicate.

I put so much of myself into 

every song I hear. I’ve changed my 
hair, my clothes, even my name 

— but I know that my love for my 
favorite songs is constant. Even 
though I know they can’t love me 
back, and that odds are I’ll never 
create anything with a fraction of 
their power. I know that I’m never 
going to write a song like “Town 
Called Malice” or “And She Was” 
or “Train in Vain.”

So why am I here?
There was a night last summer, 

when I was only out to a few 
people, and when my burden felt 
like it was trying to jump out of 
me in a daring escape every single 
lonely evening, when I listened 
to Against Me’s “Transgender 
Dysphoria Blues” (the song) over 
and over again. That track has 
always fucked me up, has always 
captured my pain so acutely that 
I can’t handle it, that I basically 
fear its power. In listening to it 
on repeat, I tried to make myself 
numb, trying not to be the kind 
of person who feels slashed to 
her core every time she hears it. 
I wanted to be immune to Laura 
Jane Grace’s diagnosis of our 
condition. I didn’t want her song 
to affect me like it did.

It never worked. I still feel 

awful and powerful and present 
whenever I hear that song. And 
I’m so glad. I’m so glad that 
another person’s art can have that 
kind of effect on me, because it 
must mean that, deep down, we all 
have within us the unfathomable 
potential to stir the most intense 

feelings possible in someone else.

This is ridiculous to admit, but 

one of my honest-to-God greatest 
fears is getting to a point in my life 
where I can’t enjoy new music, 
where I’ll be stuck listening to 
whatever the equivalent of classic 
rock radio is in 2040. I’ll be raving 
about how Kendrick Lamar will 
always be the greatest rapper of all 
time, how no pop star can top Carly 
Rae Jepsen and how no punk band 
could ever match The Menzingers’ 
energy and power. I never want to 
be stuck like this. I always want to 
be able to hear what’s next.

If I get my way, music will 

always fuck me up. It will always 
push my heart up my throat. It 
will always make me smile or 
cry, or make my body tremble 
with anxiety and joy. It will 
always force me to a point beyond 
comprehension, and it will always 
make my body dance and move in 
a way it physically shouldn’t.

The passion I have for the 

greatest artists will always exceed 
my capacity to describe them. 
And whatever name I attach to 
the art that builds me up, whether 
when I plug my now-discontinued 
iPod classic into a computer it 
says “Adam’s ancient iPod” or 
“Lauren’s life-sustaining music 
device,” I look at those songs and 
I feel ready and OK and at least 
somewhat prepared for my life 
ahead of me, even if I can’t even 
begin to picture it. Isn’t that great?

HBO

Silicon Valley returns Sunday, April 23
‘Silicon Valley’ remains 
both intelligent and witty

HBO’s hit series returns with fresh wit and disaster for the crew

Throughout its third season, 

“Silicon 
Valley” 
sharpened 

its comedic wit and honed its 
storytelling abilities to produce a 
hilarious comedy replete with a 
compelling and sound plot. There 
were no missteps or questionable 
decisions. It became a show that 
viewers could enjoy purely for how 
well-rounded it was. Now entering 
its fourth season, “Silicon Valley” 
not only maintains its momentum, 
but advances it. A fitting follow-up 
to its impeccable third season, the 
outstanding latest season reveals 
that series visionary Mike Judge 
(“Office Space”) is not content 
to rest on his laurels, despite 
the show’s plethora of Emmy 
nominations.

Picking up several weeks after 

the events of the end of season 
three, the fourth season premiere 
wastes no time in resuming Pied 
Piper’s meandering journey in the 
tech capital of the world. The series 
immediately drops audiences into 
the action as Richard Hendricks 
(Thomas Middleditch, “The Final 
Girls”) attempts to put his fraud 
allegations behind him. “Silicon 
Valley” doesn’t shy away from 
diving back into its plot, and 
audiences 
are 
rewarded 
with 

updates on each of the show’s 
central characters.

A hallmark of the series’s first 

three seasons is the constant barbs 
between Gilfoyle (Martin Starr, 
“Operator”) 
and 

Dinesh 
(Kumail 

Nanjiani, “Franklin 
& 
Bash”). 
Their 

frequent trade-off of 
insults consistently 
produces some of 
the most hilarious 
moments of “Silicon 
Valley.” The show 
evidently has no 
intention of robbing 
audiences 
of 
these 
fantastic 

scenes, featuring a verbal spar in 
which Dinesh brags, “I’ll never 
underestimate my talents again,” 
before Gilfoyle replies: “Don’t 
worry — I’ll continue to do it for 
you.”

Another strength of “Silicon 

Valley” ’s new season is its 
commitment to developing diverse 
and charismatic characters. With 
a large cast, the series has at times 
struggled to give equal weight to its 
various, competing narratives.

In this latest season, however, the 

show strikes an effective balance 
among its different storylines. The 
result is more screen-time for some 
of “Silicon Valley” ’s most likeable — 
yet underrepresented — characters. 
More scenes with the eccentric 
Gavin Belson (Matt Ross, “Turn 
the River”) and his naïve security 
chief Hoover (Chris Williams, 
“Dodgeball: A True Underdog 
Story”) are always welcome.

One of the best results of these 

multiple 
plotlines 
in 
“Silicon 

Valley” is the return of venture 
capitalist Russ Hanneman (Chris 
Diamantopoulos, “The Art of 
the Steal”), in all his absurd, calf-
implant glory. After featuring in 
only one episode of season three, 
Hanneman has re-entered the 
show and seems poised for a 
prominent role in the new season. 
Despite the time off, Hanneman 
hasn’t lost sight of the important 
things in life, telling Hendricks 
during a meeting at his child’s 
school: “My fucking nanny got 
another DUI and lost her license, so 
now I’m stuck picking up my own 
kid like an asshole.”

Throughout this most recent 

season’s first two episodes, “Silicon 

Valley” 
maintains 

its brand of smart 
yet ridiculously fun 
humor. The show 
separated 
itself 

during its initial 
seasons 
through 

employing 
witty, 

thoughtful 
jokes. 

This latest season 
continues to depend 
on this style to 

produce hilarious scenes, and 
viewers should appreciate “Silicon 
Valley” ’s type of thoughtful — but 
not overly sophisticated — humor.

That’s not to say that the series 

doesn’t boast its share of more 
juvenile humor — it most certainly 
does. This quality is especially clear 
in the show’s most recent season, 
which includes several hilarious, 
low-brow scenes. Nowhere in 
“Silicon Valley” ’s new season is 
this more apparent than in the 
season premiere, which contains 
a running gag of employees at 
prominent Silicon Valley firms 
being relocated to offices directly 
across from bathrooms that make 
for 
incredibly 
awkward 
and 

frequent eye-contact.

In its first three seasons, “Silicon 

Valley” established a high comedic 
and entertainment standard for 
itself that appeared difficult to top. 
Still, this latest season manages 
to do just that, and provides both 
excitement and laughs in equal 
doses from start to finish.

beginning, became the best 

choice he made.

A dream come true
Jake Lourim dreamed of 
writing for The Michigan 
Daily since he was 6 years 
old and went to sleep 
thinking about Michigan 
sports.
» Page 2B

Before 
this 
weekend, 

Michigan 
baseball 
coach 

Erik Bakich billed his team’s 
showdown 
against 
No. 
18 

Oklahoma as a “heavyweight 
fight”. The Wolverines showed 
they were more than prepared 
for 
this 
battle, 
sweeping 

the Sooners in commanding 
fashion and notching their first 
ranked win of the season in the 
process. 

Over the course of the sweep 

in which it outscored Oklahoma 
25-8, No. 13 Michigan (6-3 Big 
Ten, 29-7 overall) allowed just 
15 hits and a .161 average – the 
lowest totals the Wolverines 
have allowed in a three-game 
series this season. 

While Oklahoma (5-4 Big 

12, 27-12 overall) lacked No. 
2 starter Jake Irvin (5-0, 1.30 
earned run average) – a potential 
first-round pick in next season’s 
MLB Draft – Michigan was also 
shorthanded. The Wolverines 
were without junior left-hander 

Michael Hendrickson, a regular 
weekend starter, who was given 
an extra day of rest. However, 
with junior right-hander Alec 
Rennard’s dominant start on 
Saturday, that void was filled.

On Thursday, junior left-

hander Oliver Jaskie recorded 
seven 
strikeouts 
in 
seven 

innings – his longest start of 
the season – while the next 

day, junior right-hander Ryan 
Nutof rebounded from a three-
run first inning to put away 
the Sooners over five straight 

scoreless 
innings. 
In 
the 

series finale, it was Rennard’s 
turn. The transfer from Santa 
Rosa Community College has 
assumed a variety of roles for 
Michigan this season, including 
spot starter, long reliever and 
closer, and against Oklahoma, 
he made a weekend start for the 
second time this season.

Despite striking out the first 

two batters he faced, it wasn’t all 
smooth sailing for Rennard on 
Saturday. He threw 43 pitches 
through the first two innings – 
needing 12 pitches to strike out 
Oklahoma leadoff hitter Ben 
Hollas – and allowed a run in 
the second inning on two bloop 
singles and a wild pitch.

“After 
that 
first 
batter, 

however many pitches it was, 
I was like ‘I gotta make the 
adjustment and find a way to 
improve,’” Rennard said. “You 
can’t let every hitter go 10 or 15 
pitches deep. It was just making 
better pitches early on so I 
could get them to swing at it, 
get them to ground out, fly out, 
get them off balance.”

Added Bakich: “That’s kind 

of a storyline with our staff. 
We seem to find our groove and 
find our rhythm and settle in.”

Rennard 
certainly 
found 

his groove. Over the next four 
innings, he threw an efficient 
45 pitches, not allowing a hit 
the rest of the way. Saturday 
saw Rennard at his best – a 
self-described “location guy” 
who lacks the velocity to blow 
hitters away, he instead relied 
on his ability to attack the 
strike zone and force outs by 
inducing soft contact.

“I don’t think I have a power 

fastball that’s going to blow by 
you,” Rennard said. “I’m going 
to beat you by pitching smarter 
than you, put (pitches) in and 
out on both sides of the plate, 
keep it low but try to outsmart 
you rather than overpower 
you.”

The weekend also saw an 

impressive performance from 
Michigan’s 
bullpen, 
which 

allowed just two runs in total. 
Perhaps the most important 
contribution came from senior 
right-hander 
Mac 
Lozer. 

Throughout the season, Lozer 

– who has allowed just two hits 
in 8.1 innings – has excelled at 

snuffing out rallies.

In both of his appearances 

against 
Oklahoma, 
Lozer 

entered with runners on base, 
and left them stranded both 
times. He finished off the 
Sooners on Friday with three 
strikeouts for his first save of 
the season, and relieved junior 
right-hander 
Jayce 
Vancena 

to strand a Sooner runner on 

second in the seventh inning of 
the series finale.

“Our starters do such a great 

job, and if they get into a little 
sticky situation, that’s what 
I’ve been doing for years,” 
Lozer said. “Alec had a great 
outing, and Jayce is one of our 
best pitchers. I’m glad I could 
help them out just like any 
other pitcher.”

Added Bakich: “For him, it’s 

his intangible skill set as much 
as his physical skill set. He’s 
obviously a very good pitcher – 
good fastball, good slider, good 
command of both. But I think 
it’s his mindset in there and the 
attack that he has. He knows 
he’s coming into a fight.”

Hendrickson 
is 
slated 
to 

pitch Tuesday against Michigan 
State, and is likely to return to 
the weekend rotation. But the 
depth of Michigan’s pitching 
staff, both in the rotation and 
in the bullpen, gives it the 
versatility 
that 
has 
proven 

invaluable so far, and it gave 
the Wolverines the boost they 
needed to secure their biggest 
series win of the season.

How my dream came true

M

y first walk started on 
Sybil around 7 a.m., 
five hours before the 

home opener 
kicked off 
two years 
ago. Around 
7:40 outside 
the stadium, 
a fan saw Jon 
Jansen across 
the street and 
yelled, “How 
ya doin’, 
Johnny?” So 
Jansen smiled and answered, 
“Can’t wait for kickoff!”

“Me too,” the fan replied. “I 

couldn’t wait for kickoff last 
Monday.”

I couldn’t wait either. I 

couldn’t wait when I was 6 years 
old.

If I hadn’t seen anything on 

that walk, I might never have 
gone for another one. But I saw 
everything I ever dreamed of 
seeing: the sun creeping over 
the scoreboard at Michigan 
Stadium, the band warming up 
in the dark at Elbel Field, the 
Michigan legends walking the 
streets.

Players and coaches often 

describe moments in sports as 
some variation of “the shot you 
dream about when you’re playing 
in the backyard as a kid.” Well, 
this was my dream. On summer 
days growing up, I’d research 
the upcoming year’s Michigan 
football team and project the 
season. On walks to school, when 
I could see my breath in the 
cold air, I’d whisper to myself a 
broadcast call of that weekend’s 
game. One day a year, the best 
day, my dad and I would make 
the trek down to Ann Arbor and 
spend the afternoon in the Big 
House.

But the story starts much 

earlier, with some late nights, a 
house in Troy and a tired 6-year-
old. When I couldn’t sleep at 

night, I’d go downstairs to see my 
parents. My dad would tell me 
to go back to bed and imagine I 
was in the press box covering the 
Michigan football team. I’d do 
that and go right to sleep.

The last Michigan game I 

attended with Dad, we sat near 
the 20-yard line on the east side 
of the stadium. Before we left, we 
gazed across the field at the press 
box, counting from the right to 
try to figure out where the Daily 
writers sat. We dreamed that I’d 
one day sit there, too.

When that day came, I started 

waking up early every Saturday 
to walk around. Sometimes I’d 
see a lot of stuff. Sometimes I’d 
see old friends, or meet new 
people. Sometimes I wouldn’t see 
much at all. Sometimes I’d just 
feel.

I exposed myself to a fair 

amount of ribbing from friends. 
Why, they wondered, did I set 
my alarm and wake up before 
sunrise on a Saturday to go … 
walk? Sometimes for as long as 
four hours? Nobody understood. 
Really, it just felt right. All I’ve 
wanted since I was a kid was to 
be a part of this.

I’d visit the golf course and 

watch kids throw footballs back 
and forth. I’d stop and see Tom 
grilling hot dogs at the tailgate 
at Main and Pauline. I’d say hello 
to Ruth and Rhonda, the elevator 
operators in Levine Tower, and 
wish them a happy game day.

I’d hear the band warming up 

at Elbel. I’d soak in the energy 
of State Street as kickoff neared 
and the tailgaters awakened. 
And the best view in town, in my 
opinion, is from the bridge on 
Stadium Boulevard, overlooking 
Ocker Field, the football practice 
facility and the rest of Ann Arbor 
in the distance.

I’d start walking at dawn and 

leave the press box at dusk, eager 
not to miss a minute. Each walk 
starts and ends at the same spot, 

but in between there is only one 
rule: You cannot rush. There is no 
rushing a dream.

Once, in high school, I went 

to see Lloyd Carr speak in my 
hometown. I shook his hand 
afterward, and he asked if I 
was coming to Michigan. So I 
told him I wanted to be a sports 
writer, and he told me about a 
great newspaper they have in 
Ann Arbor called The Michigan 
Daily. Then he signed a piece 
of paper that’s still at home 
somewhere: “Jake — See you at 
Michigan,” he wrote, and then he 
did, when I started working for 
the newspaper he once told me 
about.

Oh, yeah, I always stop there 

on my walk, in the brick building 
on Maynard Street with the 

stained-glass windows and 
wooden doors. When I first came 
in during high school, it was love 
at first sight if ever there was 
such a thing. That day may have 
changed my life more than any 
other. The next morning, I woke 
up at home, went across the hall 
and told Mom and Dad, smiling 
from ear to ear, “I’m going to be a 
Wolverine.”

I first came to production 

on the first Thursday night of 
freshman year, and it was the 
most magical thing I’d ever 
seen. I didn’t ever want to leave. 
So that became my college 
experience — working five nights 
a week, from 6 p.m. until “We 
made a paper,” sharing a place 
with people who loved what 
I loved. We watched sports 

and played chair monkey and 
invented more newsroom games 
and made papers. I laughed all 
night with Max and Max, sent 
our pages in a different language 
each night, told Emma what was 
new, answered Shoham’s bell 
and waited all night with The 
Thursday Night Crew. And I 
learned this: As it turns out, the 
best parts of a dream are the ones 
you can’t even dream yet.

One day, of course, it was time 

for my last walk. I made it my 
best one, circling campus a few 
times, watching the team get 
off the bus outside the tunnel, 
standing on the field until they 
kicked me off. I came down from 
the press box to watch the players 
touch the banner, and again to 
watch the band at halftime. I 

watched the snow transform the 
Big House into a wonderland.

After it was over, the last 

stories published, we went down 
to the field to enjoy the final 
scene. We threw the football 
around and made snow angels 
and ran out of the tunnel. Then 
I stuck around and sat in the 
stands of Michigan Stadium, dark 
and empty and beautiful.

I cried. I had lived my dream. 

It was pitch-black by then, so 
after a while I stood up, grabbed 
my briefcase and started to walk.

It takes many people to make 

a dream come true, and if you’re 

reading this, you’re one of them.

Beginnings and endings

I 

went through some old 
emails today. Found one I 
sent in June 2013.

I introduced myself and 

said I was interested in joining 
the sports 
section 
of The 
Michigan 
Daily. It 
would be a 
great way 
to combine 
my loves 
for sports 
and writing, 
I wrote, 
“while also 
enhancing my on campus 
[sic] experience.” I must have 
thought that was a killer line 
back then.

The truth was, the Daily’s 

New Student Edition had just 
arrived at my house, and I had 
been thumbing through the 
pages in my porch. I had seen 
all the places the Daily had 
sent writers — all the things 
they had seen — and couldn’t 
believe it. Someone from the 
Daily was really there when 
Trey Burke made ‘The Shot?’ It 
sounded like the coolest job in 
the world.

I fired off a shoddy email 

with a couple of typos and 
figured I would see what came 
of it. I’m sure many others did 
the same.

The first response came 

from Zach, who was polite 
enough not to mention my 
typos. He told me there was no 
interview process to join. If I 
wanted to write, I could write.

Greg responded a few days 

later. He told me I’d need 
to submit a hair sample, my 
social security number and my 
facebook profile info. If he’s 
reading this, I bet he’s still 
laughing at that joke.

Anyway, he told me what the 

process would be and that he’d 
love to show me around during 
orientation. I told him I’d be 
sure to stop by as soon as I got 
to campus. And then I didn’t.

It’s not that it took me 

terribly long to join — I think 
I still made it in by the end of 
September — but, looking back, 
I can’t believe I waited that 
long.

I clearly wanted to be part 

of the sports staff, but, for 
whatever reason, I didn’t 
actually nudge myself through 
the door.

Having since had access to 

that same sports editor email 
account, I know how many 
people send the same kind of 
email before their freshmen 
years. I know how many never 
show up. I don’t fault them for 
it.

I only feel bad that they 

don’t even know what they’re 
missing.

***

Sometime early this 

semester, John said something 
that caught me off guard. I 
don’t remember where it came 
from, I just remember the 
unexpected weight of it: “All 
beginnings are hard.”

I’m sure there was a relevant 

reason for him saying that 
particular sentence at that 
particular moment, but I 
wasn’t paying very close 
attention. Instead, I was 
thinking about all my botched 
beginnings.

I remember my first State 

News practice, when I hurled 
some irrelevant dig at Jake 
and he responded with the 
verbal embodiment of a second 
chance: “What did you say?”

He’s now one of my best 

friends in the world.

I remember my first date 

with Allison, the panic attack, 
and the certainty that there 
wouldn’t be a second.

I wrote parts of this column 

on the way home from visiting 
her in Cleveland, two years later.

I remember my first ever 

sportswriting internship, where 
I knocked a plate out of Roy 
Williams’ hand, botched a bunch 
of names and got my stories torn 

to pieces by a grizzled editor. 
(There’s no present comparison 
here. I just sucked.)

In that moment in John’s 

classroom, I just sort of 
nodded back at him, searching 
my mind for an exception 
to his rule but finding only 
confirmation.

Those emails with Greg and 

Zach never came to mind, but, 
looking at them today, they too 
were part of a rocky beginning. 
So was the fact that it took me 
months to follow up on them.

But what Greg and Zach 

never mentioned in their 
emails was how the Daily 
would change my life — how 

Max, Alexa, Alejandro and I 
would chase Jim Harbaugh’s 
car from a private hangar to 
the Detroit Metro Airport; 
how my roommate and I would 
tape every article we wrote 
our freshman year to our dorm 
wall; how I would stay up all 
night waiting for the paper to 
be delivered one night; how, 
before I knew it, all of this 
would be over.

***

I put off writing this as long 

as I could because I couldn’t 
convince myself to start. The 
beginning of this column 
would be, quite literally, the 
beginning of the end.

Nothing seemed like the 

right topic. No one idea seemed 
worthy of being the last thing 
I said in a newspaper that has 
meant the world to me.

Somehow, I got it in my head 

that I should look for that email 
I sent four years ago. It was a 
good reminder that the end of 
my Daily career doesn’t need to 
be magnificent and special; the 
beginning wasn’t, either.

What really mattered was 

in the middle: broomball; 
El Azteco; chair monkey; 
medieval baseball; Thursday 
nights; free press food; those 
12 Big Ten cities; those nights 
in Chicago; all of the people 
who were there for all of it.

Right now, I’m watching 

Kevin give edits to a kid who 
is writing his first story. I have 
no idea whether he will ever 
come back — whether this is 
his last story, too, or whether 
it’s only the beginning. I don’t 
know whether he’s going to 
experience all these feelings 
and places and people who 
make this place so special.

But he walked in the door, 

and he started. Sometimes, 
that’s the hardest part.

Bultman will be pretty bored 

starting now. He wants to 

thank you for reading all these 

years, and you can email him 

at bultmanm@umich.edu or 

tweet at him @m_bultman.

Wolverines salvage series victory on the road 

Heading 
into 
the 
seventh 

inning Sunday, the Michigan 
softball team stared an unpleasant 
fate square in the face. 

Just three outs stood in the 

way of an unimaginable series 
loss to the Big Ten bottom dweller 
Maryland (2-9 Big Ten, 9-30-1 
overall).

A two-out, two-run triple in 

the bottom of the fifth off the bat 
of outfielder Sarah Calta gave the 
Terrapins a 3-2 lead, leaving the 
Wolverines (11-2, 31-9-1) with just 
three outs to salvage at least a run 
to extend the game.

The plucky Terrapins had 

nothing to lose and everything to 
gain — seeking little more than to 
play spoiler.

Michigan, on the other hand, 

needed the win to stay within a 
game of Minnesota (10-1, 38-3) 
atop the Big Ten standings. A loss 
would have all but extinguished 
Michigan’s 
chances 
at 
its 

10th-straight Big Ten regular-
season title.

With 
“better 
energy,” 
as 

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
described, 
the 
Wolverines 

managed to piece together a rally.

After Maryland left-hander 

Hannah Dewey walked the bases 
loaded, senior centerfielder Kelly 
Christner came through with a 
single that dropped into shallow 
left field to tie the game at three. 
Sophomore outfielder Coutney 
Richardson then came through 
with a long sacrifice fly to the 
right field warning track to grab 
the lead. 

Senior 
right-hander 
Megan 

Betsa shut the door from there, 
closing out the game and claiming 
the 
series 
with 
a 
scoreless 

seventh.

Overall, Hutchins was pleased 

with her pitchers’ performance 
on the weekend, even when the 
offense sputtered. 

“Megan’s been a rock for us,” 

Hutchins said. “She’s our leader. 
She’s throwing right now with an 
offense that’s underperforming. 
So she’s got to have nerves of steel, 
and I was really proud of her. I 
thought she really had a gutsy 

performance today.”

After cruising to a 5-1 victory 

Friday evening behind another 
stalwart effort from Betsa, the 
Wolverines headed into Saturday 
looking to take control of the 
series.

Instead, Michigan was held to 

only one hit in its first six innings, 
heading to the final frame down 
2-0.

The Wolverines looked primed 

to sneak out the win in the seventh 
inning, though, when Richardson 
knocked 
home 
freshman 

outfielder Thais Gonzalez with 
nobody out.

An offense that had otherwise 

been anemic all day came to 
life in hopes of salvaging an 
eighth-straight victory over the 
Terrapins. 

But the comeback on this day 

wasn’t meant to be, as the rally 
would halt there. With runners 
on first and second base for 
Michigan, Hutchins called for a 
sacrifice bunt from sophomore 
catcher Katie Alexander to move 
both runners into scoring position 
with only one out. 

Though senior third baseman 

Linsday Montemarano followed 
that up with the single the 
Wolverines needed, Richardson 
was subsequently thrown out 
at home. Freshman shortstop 
Madison Uden then grounded out 
to third base, ending the threat 
and giving the Terrapins their 
first win over the Wolverines 
since Feb. 17, 2012.

Hutchins knows Michigan’s 

offensive production — scoring 
just 10 runs all weekend against 
a team that came in allowing 6.57 
runs per game — won’t cut it.

Her 
decision 
to 
jumble 

the lineup Sunday — moving 
sophomore 
second 
baseman 

Faith Canfield to the leadoff spot, 
Alexander to fifth and placing 
sophomore 
outfielder 
Natalie 

Peters in the ninth spot among 
the fray — conveyed as much.

“We’re counting on people 

to do their part. If people don’t 
do their part we’re gonna move 
people around, we’re gonna put 
other people in,” Hutchins said. 
“I believe that any one of my kids 
can get it done at anytime — I 
believe in all of them. I just need 
them to believe in them. They 
need to believe in themselves.”

Richardson, though, was a 

bright spot amongst the offensive 
turmoil. Her double Saturday 
accounted for the team’s only 
run, her solo home run gave the 
Wolverines an early lead Sunday 
and she capped off a banner 
weekend with the go-ahead sac-
fly in Sunday’s win. 

On 
the 
weekend, 
the 

Wolverines will breathe a sigh 
of relief on the way back to Ann 
Arbor. They skirted potential 
disaster, conquering two of three 
on the weekend in advance of a 
midweek game against Michigan 
State.

But in the long term, the 

unforeseen weekend-long fight 
highlights a sporadic offensive 
output that has plagued the team 
all year — a reputation it will try to, 
and need to, shed if it harbors any 
hopes of a Big Ten Tournament 
and NCAA Tournament run.

Michigan falls short of Super Six

The final score was 196.4625. 
It was illuminated on the 

scoreboard, it showed up on the 
monitors, it sat on the record 
sheet. It was a decent score, 
good enough for a fifth-place 
finish at the NCAA Semifinals. 
But for the Michigan women’s 
gymnastics 
team, 
it 
wasn’t 

enough to send the team to the 
Super Six.

And for seniors Talia Chiarelli 

and Nicole Artz, it marked 
their final meet as Michigan 
gymnasts. 

“They’ve been my role models, 

they’ve been my sisters, my best 
friends,” said sophomore Olivia 
Karas. “I mean, anything you 
could possibly say about two 
people. … I could go on for hours 
about what they’ve done for this 
program, this team, the people 
on this team, the people before 
me on the team.

“It’s just been like a whirlwind 

of things they’ve done. They’re 
the best two captains I could 
have asked for. You can’t ask for 
much more in senior captains 
and friends and people, and I’m 
so lucky I got the opportunity 
to get to know them as well as I 
did.”

Out of six teams in a bracket 

stacked with top-ranked teams, 
the Wolverines finished fifth. 
Only the top three teams in 
the session move on to the next 
round, and those spots were 
claimed 
by 
Louisiana 
State 

(198.2750), Florida (197.8125) 
and 
Alabama 
(197.6000). 

Nebraska also topped Michigan 
with a score of 197.2125, while 
Georgia rounded out the bottom 
of the bracket with 195.8000.

Artz, Chiarelli and junior 

Brianna Brown were the only 
gymnasts on the roster with 
previous NCAA Tournament 
experience. Artz finished her 
final season with eight All-
American 
honors, 
including 

second-team honors on bars and 
floor, where she tied for ninth 
and 15th, respectively.

Brown also tied for ninth on 

the bars and received second-
team honors for the event with 

a score of 9.9000. Sophomore 
Olivia Karas, one of four 
athletes who participated in 
the all-around, tied for 11th 
and finished with a score of 
39.4250 and received second-
team honors for vault, where 
she tied for fifth with a score 
of 9.900. 

The Wolverines — who came 

into the meet with Big Ten, Big 
Ten Tournament and NCAA 
Regional titles — stumbled in 
their early events and were 
unable to come back with 
enough firepower to make up for 
where they fell short.

Paige Zaziski, a junior all-

around transfer from Arkansas, 
initially fell on the bars, resulting 
in a 9.1375. The score wasn’t 
counted, as five other routines 
were hit on the bars, and Zaziski 
made a comeback on the beam 
with a team-high 9.8875.

The rest of the beam scores 

weren’t as beneficial, though. 
Chiarelli lost her balance on a 
side aerial and suffered a fall, 
resulting in a 9.3250. Freshman 
Lexi Funk fell as well, forcing 
Michigan to take one of the two 
falls.

“From the very first event, 

our last person up missed a 
bar routine,” said Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki. “That was 
not a fall we had to count, but 
in a competition like this, every 
single tenth counts. We ended 
up counting a 9.825 instead of 
probably a 9.900, so that wasn’t 
devasting, but it was like the 
first break of the meet. And 
then we went to beam … and we 
counted a fall there.”

A lackluster vault rotation 

didn’t help the cause, either. 
Karas and sophomore Emma 
McLean 
were 
the 
only 

gymnasts to hit above a 9.8000, 
with a 9.9000 and 9.8375, 
respectively.

“We 
just 
did 
not 
vault 

anything 
near 
what 
we’re 

capable of vaulting,” Plocki said. 
“There was no one error that 
made the difference, it was a 
combination of things.”

Even though the floor scores 

saw improvement, the damage 
had been done. The Wolverines 
knew in the last rotation that 
mathematically, a berth to the 
Super Six wasn’t an option. 
Their season was over.

As Plocki put it: “Just not our 

night.”

Wolverines throttled by Buckeyes

An airplane boasting a banner 

that read, “Ass Kickin’ Hot Sauce” 
flew above Michigan Stadium on 
Saturday morning. That same day, 
Ohio State’s men’s lacrosse team 
matched the condiment’s fiery 
intensity.

In the Battle of the Big House, 

the ninth-ranked Buckeyes (2-1 
Big Ten, 11-2 overall) scored first, 
just 13 seconds into the contest. 
Their efficiency set the tone for 
the rest of the game en route to an 
18-7 victory.

The 
visitors 
kept 
their 

momentum going with another 
goal just over a minute later by 
attacker Jack Jasinski. Michigan 
(0-3, 8-4) stalled to step up their 
aggressiveness on the offensive 
end, firing its first attempt four 
minutes into the first half. The 
Wolverines finally scored with 
9:57 left in the period after senior 
Ian King weaved through the Ohio 
State defense to cut the deficit to 
2-1.

The Buckeye defense remained 

stingy, which transitioned into 
efficient offensive play. Michigan’s 
shots on goal were either blocked 

by the goalkeeper or flew just 
outside of the net. By the time 
the Wolverines scored their first 
goal, Ohio State had been 3-for-5 
in scoring its shots on goal while 
Michigan was just 1-for-7.

From the third goal of the 

game until halftime, the Buckeyes 
scored on every one of their shot 
attempts except for their final try 
in the waning seconds of the first 
quarter. Ohio State scored once in 
each of the last four minutes of the 
quarter, going 7-for-10 before the 
second-half faceoff.

“It 
just 
comes 
down 
to 

execution,” said Michigan coach 
John Paul. “That’s a Final Four-
level team you’re seeing out 
there. They’re clicking. … They’re 
executing at a really high level.”

Buckeye attacker Tre Leclaire 

led the charge for the away team, 
picking up two goals and three 
assists before the midway point 
of the second quarter. One of his 
goals came after an unnecessary 
roughness 
penalty 
by 
the 

Wolverines that gave Ohio State a 
man-up advantage.

After the team fell behind by 

eight goals, Michigan replaced 
junior Tommy Heidt with senior 
Robbie Zonino in goal, needing 

an offensive catalyst. Sophomore 
midfielder Decker Curran had the 
hot hand. He scored twice in two 
minutes to cut the lead to 9-3 with 
7:22 left in the second quarter. 
However, 
Buckeye 
midfielder 

Christian Feliziani scored shortly 
after for his first goal of the 
season, and Ohio State tacked 
on one more goal to end the half 
ahead, 11-3.

The Buckeyes continued their 

scoring barrage in the second 
half, scoring just 17 seconds into 
the third quarter. Their success 
on faceoffs came from midfielder 
Jake Withers, who ranks fifth in 
the country and has a faceoff win 
percentage of 66. Ohio State scored 
again two minutes later to widen 
its lead, 13-3. The Wolverines 
notched a point with 10 minutes 
remaining in the quarter by junior 
midfielder PJ Bogle, but Leclaire 
struck once again to push the lead 
to 10.

“Especially early in the game, 

we struggled,” Paul said. “Their 
faceoff guy is the best in the 
country. But I thought we did a 
really good job getting the ball 
into ground ball situations and not 
letting them win stuff clean.”

Again, the Buckeyes’ efficiency 

was remarkable. By their 14th 
goal, both teams had attempted 
22 shots — Michigan had made 
just four goals. The Wolverines’ 
inability to score was due in part 
to Ohio State’s fourth-ranked 
defense that allows under eight 
goals per game.

Curran remained a bright spot 

for Michigan, though, earning 
a hat trick in the third quarter. 
He ended with a career-high 
four goals. The Wolverines also 
committed 10 fewer turnovers.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

ultimately outshot the Buckeyes, 
49-34, Ohio State left Ann Arbor 
with an overwhelming victory. 
Michigan simply couldn’t execute 
on the offensive end, as the 
Buckeye goalkeepers combined 
to stop 15 shots. It was Michigan’s 
third loss in three Battle of the Big 
House contests.

“I liked what our offense was 

doing and what our offense was 
getting,” Paul said. “We just 
weren’t finishing the same way 
they were.”

Though trending up, 
‘M’ loses the Battle 

In the Battle of the Big House, 

Ohio State showed why it is a 
top-ten team in the country. 

On Saturday afternoon in 

front of a record crowd of 18,588, 
the Michigan men’s lacrosse 
team (0-3 Big Ten, 8-4 overall) 
couldn’t contain its rival’s elite 
offense in an 18-7 loss to the 
ninth-ranked 
Buckeyes 
(2-1, 

11-2).

That crowd — a mix of spring 

football game attendees and 
newfound hype for the lacrosse 
team — saw an 
inexperienced 
team, but also 
evidence of the 
strides the team 
has taken in its 
sixth 
varsity 

season.

With 
one 

game 
left 
in 

Big Ten play, 
the Wolverines 
have 
already 

reached a new season-high win 
total with eight, a season-high 
goals per game average at 10.50 
and a season-high team assist 
total with 75. They also beat a 
ranked team for the first time in 
program history.

The 
Buckeyes, 
though, 

exposed how much more room 
Michigan has to grow. While 
the Wolverines have scored 58.2 
percent of their shots on goal this 
season, against the Buckeyes, 
Michigan converted just 31.8 
percent on 7-for-22 shooting.

Despite having more shots, 

committing fewer turnovers and 
fewer penalties, the Wolverines 
could not capitalize Saturday.

“It comes down to execution,” 

said Michigan coach John Paul. 
“They’re executing at such a 
high level right now, that’s a 
Final Four-level team you’re 

seeing out there. They turned 
the ball over a lot more, we 
cleared better. You take a look 
at these (stats) and you’d think, 
‘Probably a pretty close game.’”

The face-off circle was one 

area where Michigan really 
struggled this weekend. On 
the season, the Wolverines are 
undefeated 
when 
controlling 

the draw. Ohio State, however, 
controlled the face-off circle, 
winning 22 of 29 Saturday. Of 
its seven wins, four directly 
followed goals for Michigan.

Despite 
the 
loss, 
the 

Wolverines still had some positive 

performances. 
Sophomore 
midfielder Decker 
Curran recorded 
a 
career-high 

four goals and 
this 
season, 

Michigan’s 
second, 
third, 

fourth and fifth 
point leaders are 
all 
sophomores, 

which bodes well 

for Michigan’s future.

With his four goals, Curran 

surpassed his season total from 
last year. As a freshman, Curran 
started eight games and led 
all freshmen in scoring. This 
season, Decker has tallied 13 
goals and six assists, putting him 
in fifth place for overall scoring 
on the team despite playing in 
just 10 of 12 games.

“We know where we are and 

we know where we want to get 
to,” Paul said. “We know how 
much we’ve improved this year 
over years past, and we just have 
to have resolve, come back and 
have a good week of practice to 
get ready for (Johns) Hopkins.”

Against Johns Hopkins, the 

Wolverines will look to secure 
their first Big Ten victory since 
2015, and build upon the potential 
they have shown all season.

BASEBALL
‘M’ sweeps Oklahoma 
with sixth-inning rally

Junior centerfielder Johnny 

Slater 
started 
what 
would 

become a five-run rally in the 
sixth inning with a hard-hit 
double to left field.

Behind 
that 
high-scoring 

frame, 
the No. 13 
Michigan 
baseball 
team (6-3 Big Ten, 29-7 overall) 
earned a 6-2 victory Sunday 
to sweep its non-conference 
adversary, No. 18 Oklahoma (5-4 
Big 12, 27-12 overall).

After a scoreless first inning 

for both teams, the Sooners got 
on the board first with a duo of 
singles off junior 
right-hander 
Alec Rennard in 
the bottom of the 
2nd inning.

Michigan 

was 
quick 
to 

respond, though, 
with a run in 
the third. After 
sophomore right 
fielder Jonathan 
Engelmann 
singled to left-center field, senior 
catcher Harrison Wenson walked 
and, with an infield hit from 
sophomore second baseman Ako 
Thomas, the bases were loaded. 
Junior 
centerfielder 
Johnny 

Slater launched a sacrifice fly into 
the outfield to bring Engelmann 
home from third to tie the game, 
1-1.

Neither team produced runs 

in the fourth or fifth innings, 
highlighted by groundouts and 
flyouts.

“The 
conditions 
played 
a 

factor,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “You knew there 
weren’t going to be any long balls 
today with the wind howling 
in. So it was going to be a game 
that probably was going to come 

down to some two-out hits, some 
situational hitting, some bunting, 
some 
stealing, 
pitching 
and 

defense.”

When Slater doubled off the 

left-field wall in the bottom of 
the sixth inning, senior shortstop 
Michael Brdar followed it up 
with a double of his own to give 
the Wolverines baserunners on 
2nd and 3rd. After intentionally 
walking redshirt sophomore left 
fielder Miles Lewis, Oklahoma 
hit junior first baseman Jake 
Bivens by a pitch for the second 
time to send Slater home for 
Michigan’s first run of the frame.

Sophomore designated hitter 

Nick Poirier then forced a walk, 
sending Brdar home. With a 
two-run lead already in hand, 

Engelmann 
singled to left 
field to send two 
more 
runs 
in. 

Wenson finished 
up the scoring 
with a sac fly 
to 
left 
field, 

forcing 
Poirier 

home to give the 
Wolverines a 6-1 
lead.

Junior 
right 

hander Jayce Vancena relieved 
Rennard in the top of the seventh 
inning, but as Oklahoma tacked 
on a run on an RBI double from 
catcher Brady Lindsly, Bakich 
substituted senior right hander 
Mac Lozer in. He would go on to 
retire the side on two groundouts.

“I’m glad I could be there for 

my guys,” Lozer said. “We took 
three games away from a really 
competitive and really good 
Oklahoma team.”

While 
the 
Sooners 
were 

missing some pivotal characters 
from their squad, such as Jake 
Irvin, who boasts a 1.30 earned-
run average over 34.2 innings 
pitched, the Wolverines have to 
be pleased with three wins over 
a highly-touted opponent.

Five Things We Learned: Spring Game

It was both a good and bad day 

for the Michigan football team, 
depending on how one would look 
at things.

On one hand, the Wolverines 

won. On the other hand, the 
Wolverines also lost. Such is 
the result of Michigan’s annual 
spring game. Saturday’s game 
was certainly more exciting than 
those of past years, featuring a late 
comeback from one team before a 
well-executed drive by the Maize 
team gave it a 31-29 victory.

Here are five things we learned 

from Saturday:

1. Wilton Speight’s backups 

are pretty talented

The quarterback competition 

seems fairly decided in redshirt 
junior Wilton Speight’s favor. 
After all, Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh went on the record on 
April 10 in saying Speight is the 
starter. But on Saturday, it was 
Speight’s presumed backups who 
dazzled.

Aside from one key mistake — 

an ill-advised throw that resulted 
in a pick-six — redshirt freshman 
Brandon Peters was outstanding. 
He displayed poise in the pocket 
while also showing off a cannon 
for an arm. He even led the Maize 
team on the game-winning drive, 
which included a deep bomb to 
redshirt freshman wide receiver 
Nate Schoenle. Peters finished 
9-of-17 for 160 yards passing 
with one touchdown and one 
interception, and even scrambled 
for a 12-yard touchdown at the 
beginning of the fourth quarter.

Fifth-year senior John O’Korn 

was impressive as well, although 
much of his success didn’t come 
until late. O’Korn, who started 
against Indiana last season when 
Speight was hurt, ran three times 
for 42 yards while completing 
three passes for 60 yards and a 
touchdown.

2. The Glasgow family name 

is in good hands

Graham is already in the 

NFL, and Ryan will be soon. 
Meanwhile, 
Jordan 
— 
the 

youngest of the three Glasgow 
brothers — continues to carve out 
a role for himself in Ann Arbor. 
Glasgow earned a reputation as 
being a special teams dynamo 
last year, and appears poised for 
a breakout season this year. He 
has been practicing mostly at the 
VIPER position vacated by Jabrill 
Peppers. In the spring game, 
however, he was exceptional at 
safety, flashing excellent ball 
skills throughout the day while 
coming up with the biggest play of 
the game, a 100-yard interception 
return for a touchdown after 
picking off Speight in the endzone.

3. The kids might be alright
Youth has been a common 

theme for Michigan this offseason, 
as the Wolverines seek to replace 
over a dozen graduated starters 
from both sides of the ball.

Key among those are the 

receiver and tight end spots. 
The trio of Amara Darboh, Jehu 
Chesson and Jake Butt graduated 
and is off to the NFL, while 
sophomore wide receiver Grant 
Perry — who would be one of 
the most experienced returning 
players — remains in limbo while 
he faces four criminal charges 
and an impending court case.

On Saturday, though, several 

key youngsters stood out at 
each position. At receiver, early 
enrollee Tarik Black impressed 
the most, snagging several balls 
down the sideline, including an 
11-yard touchdown reception from 
O’Korn. At tight end, meanwhile, 
Zach Gentry and Nick Eubanks 
played well. Gentry, converted to 
the position from quarterback, 
scored the first touchdown of the 
game, catching a pass up the seam 
before making a safety miss and 
taking it to the house for a 55-yard 
score. His counterpart Eubanks 
looked smooth as well, making 
two catches and nearly hauling in 
a deep ball down the sideline that 
popped loose from his grasp at the 
last second.

4. No Kenny, no problem?

Michigan graduated kicker and 

punter (there’s a recurring theme 
here) Kenny Allen after last year. 
Allen was adept at both of his jobs, 
knocking in 37 field goals at an 
82-percent clip over two seasons 
while averaging 43.3 yards on 54 
punts last year.

But like at other positions, there 

may not be too much of a drop-off 
from Allen’s replacements. Quinn 
Nordin, formerly the No. 1 rated 
kicker out of high school, knocked 
in a 48-yard field goal that would 
have been good from 50-plus, and 
Kyle Seychel kicked the game-
winning field goal (even after 
an attempted icing) to give the 
Maize team steak for dinner. Will 
Hart handled punting duties for 
both sides, kicking it eight total 
times for an average of 39.5 yards 
per punt.

5. The defense still looks 

good

The Wolverines have said it 

many times over through the 
offseason: they expect there to be 

little drop-off between last year’s 
defense — No. 1 in the nation 
— and this year’s unit. Game 
action against real opponents 
will tell whether that is the case, 
but for now, this year’s defense 
does indeed look pretty good. 
The defensive line and blitzing 
linebackers 
created 
problems 

in pass protection, beating the 
offensive line for five total sacks. 
Meanwhile, there were three total 
interceptions — two of which went 
the other way for touchdowns 
— made on presumed starter 
Speight and Peters. Players such 
as sophomores Khaleke Hudson 
and Devin Bush Jr. laid the wood, 
and defensive coordinator Don 
Brown was as aggressive as ever 
with his play-calling. There will 
be some struggles along the way 
as this youthful unit continues 
to develop and gain experience 
— after all, the offense did record 
several big plays on the day. 
But the ceiling for the defense 
remains as high as ever.

Peters leads Maize to victory

At the start of last season, Jim 

Harbaugh didn’t know who his 
quarterback would be. Redshirt 
sophomore Wilton Speight and 
redshirt juniors John O’Korn 
and Shane Morris all presented 
compelling cases for the starting 
job.

But on the first Saturday of 

September, Speight stepped onto 
the field at Michigan Stadium to 
take the first snap of the 2016-
17 season and never looked 
back. Starting all but one game 
— due to a shoulder injury — 
Speight threw for 2,538 yards 
and 18 touchdowns with a 61.6 
completion percentage.

Coming 
into 
the 
2017-18 

season, it would be safe to 
assume that the now-redshirt 
junior would take the field for 
the Michigan football team in 
its season opener at Cowboys 
Stadium in Arlington, TX.

But that’s not the way redshirt 

freshman quarterback Brandon 
Peters sees it.

After the Wolverines’ annual 

spring game Saturday, Peters was 
asked if he was trying to be the 
starter for this season opener.

“Of course,” Peters said with 

a smile. “Why would I not want 
to?”

His 
performance 
Saturday 

proved that sentiment.

As the starting quarterback for 

the Maize team that topped the 
Blue team, 31-29, Peters tackled 
the competition against Speight 
and O’Korn, both of whom led the 
Blue team, head on and came out 
on top. He completed 9 of 17 passes 
for 160 yards and tallied both a 
touchdown and an interception. 
Meanwhile, Speight went 9-for-26 
for 78 yards with two interceptions 
and no touchdowns, and O’Korn 
went 3-for-6 for 60 yards and a 
touchdown.

Peters struck first halfway 

through the first quarter, finding 
junior tight end Zach Gentry wide 
open in the middle of the field. 
Gentry returned the favor, making 
junior 
defensive 
back 
Louis 

Grodman miss and taking it to the 
end zone for a 55-yard touchdown.

It wasn’t until the third quarter 

that Peters made his first mistake. 
Off balance, he threw the ball to 
no one in particular, and senior 
cornerback 
Brandon 
Watson 

pounced on it. Peters tried to stop 
him, but Watson took the pass 
straight to the end zone for a pick-
six, giving the Blue team its first 
lead of the game.

“As soon as I let go of it, I just 

followed the play,” Peters said. 
“... I didn’t really see him when I 
threw it.”

Eager to make up for his error, 

Peters quickly marched his side 
down the field, and then handed 
the ball off to sophomore running 
back Kareem Walker for what 
looked to be an easy score. But an 
illegal formation penalty negated 
the touchdown right before the 
end of the quarter.

Peters didn’t let that drive 

go to waste, though. Just eight 
seconds into the fourth quarter, 
he scrambled into open space and 
rushed 12 yards into the end zone 
to retake the lead at 21-17.

“I just felt the pressure and 

my read wasn’t there, so I made 
myself check down and made a 
big play,” Peters said.

Though the game looked to be 

over when junior safety Jordan 
Glasgow intercepted a pass from 
Speight in the red zone and took 
it 100 yards to the opposite end 
zone, O’Korn came into the game 
with just under five minutes 
remaining and made his presence 
felt. 
Leading 
two 
straight 

scoring drives, one in which he 
threw an 11-yard touchdown to 
freshman wide receiver Tarik 
Black and another in which he 
handed it off to junior running 
back Karan Higdon for a two-
yard touchdown, O’Korn carried 
the Blue team to a 29-28 lead. 
With just 1:38 left on the clock, it 
looked like O’Korn had sealed the 
comeback victory.

But the day belonged to Peters, 

and he made sure of it.

“The first play, I was like, ‘Let’s 

call a deep shot,’ ” Peters said. 
“And (offensive coordinator Tim 
Drevno) was like, ‘OK, let’s do it.’ ”

From his own 40-yard line, 

Peters unloaded a rocket pass 
toward sophomore wide receiver 
Nate Schoenle, who was running 
down the right sideline. The 

ball came down perfectly into 
his grasp for what looked like a 
50-yard completion. 

“I saw it was man coverage 

and that route is perfect for man 
coverage, and we just executed,” 
Peters said.

Strategically moving the ball 

and calling timeout in a four-play 
sequence, Peters set junior kicker 
Kyle Seychel up for a chance at 
the game-winner with just a few 
seconds left. Seychel left no doubt 
about it, nailing the 31-yard field 
goal as time expired.

Peters — ranked as the sixth-

best 
pro 
style 
quarterback 

nationally in his class in the 
ESPN300 — didn’t take part in 
the quarterback competition last 
year, eventually redshirting in 
his freshman season. Though a 
quarterback battle hasn’t been 
expected to take place this year, 
he acknowledged that Harbaugh 
preaches competition above all 
else.

And 
while 
Speight 
is 

undoubtedly Michigan’s starter, 
Peters made it clear that he intends 
to turn it into a competition. 

Bush shines on defensive side

When Devin Bush Jr. came 

to Michigan, waiting wasn’t an 
option.

As defensive coordinator Don 

Brown recalls, the Wolverines 
made Bush the second-string 
WILL linebacker “virtually when 
he walked in the door.”

And on Saturday afternoon, 

almost a year after walking in 
that door, it was easy to see why.

Bush 
finished 
with 
three 

tackles on the day, serving as 
one highlight of a Michigan 
defensive unit that put Wilton 
Speight under pressure during 
the entirety of the spring game. 
The redshirt junior quarterback 
took three sacks — a number that 
could have been inflated if not for 
Speight’s own evasiveness — and 
threw two interceptions, one of 
which resulted in a 100-yard pick-
six in the fourth quarter.

If the Wolverines weren’t 

barred from tackling the men 
behind center, Speight would 
probably be hurting, and Bush 

would have been a big reason why 
— accounting for two of the three 
sacks himself (for a loss of 21 
yards) and showcasing his ability 
to blow up plays in the backfield if 
Brown calls for such.

More 
importantly, 
though, 

Bush’s 
performance 
Saturday 

afternoon was a microcosm of 
the accumulation of factors that 
contributed to his development 
over his first year in Ann Arbor.

And 
that 
first 
year 
of 

development 
was 
a 
busy 

one. Though the sophomore 
linebacker was featured at the 
WILL linebacker spot during 
his freshman year, he lined up 
as a starter at the MIKE position 
during the spring game.

Contributing early on at the 

WILL had benefits in and of 
itself, as Bush was given the 
opportunity to learn behind 
Mike McCray, the early de 
facto leader of this Wolverine 
defensive unit.

“Mike’s always gonna be there 

when I need help,” Bush said. 
“He’s always gonna correct me 
when I’m wrong. He’s hard on 

me too. He wants me to make 
the play that no one thinks I can 
make.

“We’ll be in meeting rooms, I’ll 

probably drop a pick, he’ll turn 
back, look at me, and just stare at 
me like, ‘Why ain’t you catch the 
ball?’ ”

But as Bush explained, being 

forced to learn the responsibilities 
of both roles slowed the game 
down for him and allowed him to 
quickly acclimate himself within 
Brown’s system — pinpointing the 
Orange Bowl as the moment that 
things finally clicked into place 
and he began feeling comfortable 
in meetings for the linebacker 
corps.

“I 
think 
he’s 
just 
more 

comfortable because he’s been 
here since last spring, been here 
for a whole year now,” McCray 
said. “It looks like he’s just more 
comfortable out there and just 
having fun.”

Outside 
of 
the 
on-field 

improvements and the mentorship 
he received from McCray, though, 
Bush has evolved physically as 
well. Despite being only four 
pounds lighter than he was at the 
beginning of Michigan’s spring 
practices — something Bush 
joked was a byproduct of eating 
more salad and grilled chicken 
— he says he has still dropped fat 
and added muscle. And Brown 
has taken notice of his sophomore 
linebacker’s new physique.

“I mean, just look at him,” 

Brown 
said. 
“I 
teased 
him 

yesterday — he walked by me 
and he didn’t have a shirt on — I 
go, ‘I remember last year, you 
were a short, pudgy guy.’ And 
he’s chiseled. He’s got a Division 
I body now.”

That “Division I” body, coupled 

with his newfound comfort on 
the defensive side, could make 
Bush an enticing marvel come the 
fall. After all, Brown is looking 
forward to seeing it himself.

“It’s so nice when you have a 

young guy like that and he can 
play two spots,” Brown said. “You 
could ask some guys to do that, 
and they’d look at you like, ‘Are 
you kidding me?’ But he handled 
it really with ease.

“We’re excited to see him when 

it’s live and in color, for sure.”
