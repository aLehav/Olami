The University of Michigan’s 

Central 
Student 
Government 

met Tuesday evening to address 
issues regarding anti-Semitism 
on campus, University efforts to 
transfer to clean energy sources 
and further revisions to the 
CSG election code. Additionally, 
the assembly continued their 
discussion regarding improved 
sexual assault prevention training 
and 
appointed 
several 
new 

student representatives. Before 
agenda items were considered, 
however, Business junior Lauren 
Ward announced her resignation 
from the assembly due to issues of 
inclusion. 

Ward referenced a previous 

virtual confrontation between her 
and a fellow CSG member, but did 
not disclose who was involved in 
this dispute. 

“I would feel remiss in my 

resignation from Central Student 
Government if I didn’t at least tell 
you all why I’ve chosen to leave 
this poisonous position,” Ward 
said. “What are we doing? Not 
just representatives, but CSG as a 
whole?”

Ward ran as a representative 

on the eMerge campaign last 
spring — the ticket made history 
when president Anushka Sarkar, 
an LSA senior, and vice president 
Nadine Jawad, a Ford senior, 
became the first women of color 
elected together since at least 1993. 

A representative of Procter 

& Gamble Co. visited the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

on Jan. 22 to lecture Ross 
School of Business students 
on 
marketing 
tactics 
and 

its role as part of the Tide 
brand. However, the lecture 
went awry after the students 
attending 
asked 
questions 

centered almost exclusively 
around popular phenomenon 
Tide 
Pods. 
Ross 
students 

have since said they were told 
the 
questions 
jeopardized 

the 
business 
schools’s 

relationship with P&G. 

While the representative, 

Business 
alum 
Courtney 

Ratkowiak, opened the floor 
for 
questions 
related 
to 

marketing, students, utilizing 
the anonymous feature of the 
question-app Pigeonhole Live, 
sent in a number of questions 
based on a popular meme 
centered around millennials 
eating Tide Pods.

P&G 
is 
an 
American 

multinational 
consumer 

goods corporation. They own 
a series of brands including 
Gillette, Old Spice, Febreze 
and 
Tide, 
among 
others. 

P&G has had a longstanding 
recruiting relationship with 
the Business School.

The 
lecture 
took 
place 

outside of normal class hours 
on a Monday night, and 
included a mix of Business 

students and non-Business 
students. 
According 
to 
a 

junior who wished to remain 
anonymous, 
the 
fact 
the 

lecture occurred outside of 
the class schedule contributed 
to the students’ attitude.

Some of the highest voted 

questions 
included: 
“What 

new flavors of tide pods do 
you have coming out?” and 
“How many tide pods a day 
keep the doctor away?”

“The problem was they used 

this anonymous app called 
Pigeonhole,” the anonymous 
junior said. “I think that was 
where they went wrong; as 
soon as they did that for the 
first time, the dynamic of the 
presentation changed.”

According to the junior, 

attendees 
wanted 
to 
post 

something 
funny 
as 
the 

questions 
continued. 
The 

representative appeared to be 

flustered, and skimmed over 
the joke-questions, answering 
only the serious ones.

“I definitely think most 

people, 
including 
myself, 

walked out of the presentation 
thinking that it was funny,” 
the junior said. “Then they 
told us P&G was reconsidering 
a relationship with Ross, and 
that 
jeopardizes 
people’s 

chances of working for them, 

Students Allied for Freedom 

and Equality held a teach-in 
Tuesday night to discuss the alt-
right’s affinity for U.S. support 
of the state of Israel, as well as 
criticisms of Israeli government. 
In 
response, 
University 
of 

Michigan Hillel held a counter-
event intended to fuel discussion 
on whether equating Zionism 
with Nazism is a modern form of 
anti-Semitism. Both events were 
highly discussed by members 
of the University community — 
tensions between pro-Palestinian 
and 
pro-Israel 
groups 
have 

remained high since the passing of 
SAFE’s #UMDivest resolution last 
November.

SAFE’s 
discussion 
on 
the 

intersection of Israel and the far 
right honed in on the example 
of Richard Spencer, a white 
supremacist who is currently 
in talks with the University 
to speak on campus. Spencer, 
SAFE proposed, seems at once 
to espouse both anti-Semitic and 
Zionist views. The teach-in was

Award-winning author talks novel, personal roots with panel of ‘U’ professors

On Tuesday, author Yaa Gyasi 

spoke at the University of Michigan 
in front of a crowded Rackham 
Auditorium to discuss her award-
winning novel “Homegoing.” After 

its publication, Gyasi won the 
National Book Critics’ Circle’s John 
Leonard First Book Prize. The novel 
has also been selected as the 2018 
book for the Washtenaw Reads 
program.

“Homegoing” 
highlights 

the story of two half sisters and 
their descendants through eight 
generations, 
going 
over 
two 

hundred years of Ghanaian and 
American history. It also highlights 
illuminating themes of racism, 
family and unity.

To begin the event, Yaa Gyasi, 

sat down with English professors 
Gaurav Desai and Aida Levy-
Hussen. She opened the discussion 
by reading a powerful excerpt from 
her novel, detailing the life of her 

character “Afiyah” and the physical 
abuse she suffered at the hands of 
her father. She then transitioned 
to the discussion with Desai and 
Levy-Hussen, as they discussed 
the novel’s origins and several of its 
central themes. In their discussion, 
Gyasi explained how she traveled 
to Ghana to conduct research after

The

Peer 

Educators at the University 
of Michigan hosted the third 
annual Panhellenic Speak Out 
on Tuesday night, providing a 
forum for survivors of sexual 
violence to share their stories 
in a confidential space.

At the event, attendees were 

welcomed 
to 
share 
stories 

in 
an 
open, 
unmoderated 

session that lasted two hours. 
Survivors shared stories from 
a wide range of experiences; 
some read poetry, some told 
their stories unscripted and 
some spoke for friends who 
were unable to speak.

LSA senior Ally Cohen and 

Kinesiology senior Cass Bouse-
Eaton 
worked 
to 
organize 

the event, with preparations 
beginning in August. Both 
have been involved with the 
event and PPE for several 
years, and they expressed their 
hope it would empower more 
survivors to share stories and 
spur action.

HEARTBREAK
puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

As of Monday, Michigan 

Medicine 
is 
now 
offering 

online healthcare for minor 
illnesses such as the flu or pink 
eye, allowing patients to seek 
treatment from the comfort 
of their homes. These eVisits, 
accessible at MyUofMhealth.
org, are available to adult 
patients seven days a week for 
$25.

Patients are able to fill out a 

questionnaire regarding their 
symptoms, similar to answering 
questions 
at 
the 
doctor’s 

office. The questionnaire is 

then reviewed by healthcare 
providers, who reference the 
given patient’s health record 
and respond with a prescription 
or care plan within 24 hours.

Michigan Medicine patients 

were already able to use an 
eVisit for cold and flu-like 
symptoms such as a sudden 
fever, body aches, chills, red 
eye, urinary problems, vaginal 
irritation, 
sinus 
issues 
and 

diarrhea.

The 
eVisit 
program 

successfully piloted last year at 
some of the Michigan Medicine 
Health Centers. Eighty percent 
of the patients who used eVisits 
during the pilot were able to get 
care without ever going into the 

doctor’s office.

In some cases, health care 

professionals 
will 
ask 
the 

patient to come into the office 
for an in-person examination 
or 
follow-up 
visit. 
Patients 

who are asked to come into the 
office are not charged for the 
eVisit.

A main advantage of eVisits 

is that they allow flexibility for 
people with busy schedules, as 
well as those who can’t afford 
to miss work. Additionally, 
online 
visits 
keep 
patients 

with contagious illnesses at 
home and prevent them from 
spreading viruses.

“Michigan 
Medicine, 
and 

other health systems across 

the country, are looking for 
ways to be more responsive 
to what patients want,” 
Larry An, medical director 
for the Telehealth Program 
at Michigan Medicine, said 
in a University press release. 
“The greatest advantage is 
convenience and providing 
the right care to patients 
with minimal disruption to 
their daily lives.” 

Michigan 
Medicine 
is 

hoping to expand its online 
care services in the future 
by extending online care to 
pediatrics, making virtual 
visits available to children 
within the next year or so.

Chicago-based 
rapper 

CupcakKe blew away records on 
Jan. 26 with her performance 
at Pride Night at Necto Night 
Club in Ann Arbor. Despite a 
building capacity of 952, 1,112 
people lined up outside the club 
to see her perform, more than 
any event the club has ever 
hosted.

Necto 
has 
welcomed 
a 

number of big-name artists 
to perform in the past — 
including Avicii and Zedd — but 

CupcakKe, whose legal name is 
Elizabeth Harris, destroyed the 
previous records.

Harris has been catapulted 

into nationwide popularity in 
recent months, largely owing to 
the overtly sexual and repetitive 
lyrics 
that 
characterize 

her music. Her first song, 
“Vagina,” was released when 
she was 17, and several others 
— including “Deepthroat” and 
“LGBT” — have gained enough 
recognition for her to release 
an album earlier this year. She 
has also appeared at a number 
of festivals and shows, even 
joining pop artist Charli XCX 

onstage 
at 
Lollapalooza 
in 

Chicago last year.

“I 
always 
try 
to 
stay 

versatile,” Harris said in an 
interview with Forbes. “So I 
try to do stuff about pedophiles 
because no one is talking about 
that. Sex, but it’s not just sex. 
Out of all my albums, there’s 
probably like six or seven sex 
songs. So it’s a lot of subjects I 
like to touch — I want to touch 
every subject as I could possibly 
touch as an artist.”

Despite 
this 
steadfast 

commitment to singing about 
issues that matter (and to 
touching), Harris is yet mostly 

known for her decidedly 
more 
vulgar 
work. 
She 

relishes the obscene, and 
she stated that she cares 
very little what others think 
of her.

“I have three alter egos. 

Number 
one: 
Elizabeth, 

she’s a stay-at-home, humble 
person. 
Then 
CupcakKe, 

the one on stage. The wild, 
sexual being. Number three 
is Marilyn Monhoe. She’s 
always on the internet to 
make jokes, have fun. … 
I’m finna say whatever the 
(expletive) I want.”

By Chris Steele

At a mass meeting on language 

requirements last night students 
voted to establish a literary college 
student union and to stage a boycott 
if the faculty takes unfavorable 
action on the language requirement 
at its next meeting, March 3. 

A call for a disruption sit in in 

Dean William Hay’s office today 
was approved on a first vote, but 
was reconstructed and defeated at 
the request of its sponsor, Radical 
Caucus, because it failed to gather a 
large enough vote. 

The motion for the student union 

was made by Daily Editor Mark 
Levin. He called for a referendum 
on the language requirement to be 
held in the next two weeks. 

In making his proposal Level 

called a disruptive sit-in a “very 
ineffective tactic” which would 
not bring effective “pressure on 
faculty members/” A disruptive sit-
in would only result in suspensions 
and arrests, he said. 

Several Radical Caucus members 

voiced objection to the student 
union proposal. Eric Chester, Grad, 
said “It’s a stall.” He conceded the 
disruptive sit-in might fail but the 
real question was “intimidation.” 
“Are we going to let the legislature 
and the faculty intimidate us?” he 
asked. 

Parliamentary action followed 

in which an unsuccessful attempt 
was made to combine Levin’s 
proposal with the Radical Caucus 
sponsored sit-in. Levin’s proposal 
was eventually passed by a vote 105 
to 96. 

A 
short 
discussion 
of 
the 

implementation of Levin’s motion 
followed the one hour debate on the 
major proposals from Levin, Radical 
Caucus and another student. 

The 
meeting 
named 
three 

students to recommend members 
of a provisional steering committee 
which would organize the student 
union. The three students are 
Radical Caucus chairman Marty 
McLaughlin, Ron Landsman, ‘70, 

and Bill Bleich, ‘69. 

The motion for the disruptive 

sit-in was introduced by Bernard 
Elbaum, ‘71, a Radical Cacaus 
member. His motion called for a 
sit-in in the LSA building to begin 
at 1 p.m. today. Students sitting-in 
would have locked all doors and 
remained in the building until the 
language requirement was abolish. 

The Radical Caucus motion was 

passed by a vote of 114 to 86, but was 
later withdrawn. 

McLaughlin moved to reconsider 

the motion and to defeat it because 
there were not enough people to 
support the sit-in. 

Radical Caucus had previously 

pledged to reconsider the motion 
if there were not 200 people in 
support. 

The vote following McLaughlin’s 

motion 
was 
overwhelmingly 

against the disruptive sit-in. 

Debate on how to arrange 

the referendum on the language 
requirements failed to reach any 
definite conclusion.

E NTRE PRE NEUR SHIP AT ROSS

Elmira Bayrasli, a professor and an entrepreneurship expert, discusses the impact entrepreneurship has on the economies of low and middle-
income countries at the Ross School of Business Tuesday. 

BRIAN AUSTIN KOSASIH/Daily

and for the most part everyone 
was galvanized to be like ‘Oh, 
we need to do something about 
this.’”

In fact, not long after the 

lecture 
had 
commenced, 

course 

instructor Burcu Tasoluk 

emailed the students informing 
them of P&G’s reaction to 
the students’ questions and 
behavior during the lecture.

The email, obtained by The 

Daily, 
noted 
hosting 
guest 

speakers is a privilege and 
presents an opportunity to 
hear 
valuable 
information 

from business professionals. 
It also referenced the Ross 
Student Code of Conduct and 
Statement 
of 
Community 

Values, encouraging students 
to adhere to the prescribed 
guidelines for behavior.

“(We) 
received 

correspondence 
from 
P&G 

following 
Monday’s 
lecture 

indicating 
disappointment 

with students’ inappropriate 
questions 
during 
the 
Q&A 

and their conduct thereafter 
(including on social media),” 
the email read. “Such behavior 
is disrespectful to the speaker, 

and reflects poorly on us, 
Ross, and the University of 
Michigan.” 

When students next attended 

class, they were informed of 
P&G’s response to the guest 
lecture 
and 
instructed 
to 

form an action plan on how 
to remedy the relationship 
with P&G. Students broke into 
groups and brainstormed ways 
to reach out to P&G.

The 
main 
goal 
of 
the 

action plan as outlined in the 
marketing class was to “reflect 
acknowledgment, 
ownership, 

and accountability of what 
happened.” A small task force 
of students wrote an apology 
letter to the P&G guest lecturer.

According 
to 
Business 

junior Connor Baechler, the 
incident negatively impacted 
students who wanted to start 
careers or internships with 
P&G. However, the recent Tide 
Pod memes had such a wide 
reach that Baechler thought 
the questions were almost 
inevitable. 

“On 
one 
hand, 
it 
is 

disappointing 
that 
current 

Ross students would disrespect 
a Ross alum during a serious 
presentation, 
even 
if 
it 

appeared to many that the 
presenter was not flustered 
by the inappropriate student 
responses,” Baechler told The 
Daily in an email interview. 

“Furthermore, 
P&G 
is 
a 

crucial 
recruiting 
partner 

for Ross and its status as 
a top business school, and 
the company expects strong 
candidates from the school in 
return. I feel especially sorry 
for any Ross students who are 
actively interested in starting 
their careers at P&G... (but) 
from another perspective, the 
timing of such a presentation 
(for a Tide product!) could not 
have been worse, with all the 
memes and spoofs about the 
‘Tide Pod Challenge’ floating 
around social media. I do 
not think P&G executives or 
Ross 
administrators 
could 

understand how prevalent the 
joke had become to any college 
student, not just Ross.”

Carolyn 
Yoon, 
Business 

professor of marketing and 
course 
coordinator, 
stated 

the Business School will use 
this situation as a case study 
and 
learning 
opportunity 

for 
students 
tasked 
with 

maintaining 
professional 

relationships in the future.

“What 
happened 
in 
the 

marketing course that day 
is not indicative of who our 
students are or our culture, 
and P&G understands that,” 
Yoon said. “We look forward 
to maintaining our partnership 
with P&G, as well as our many 
other corporate partners.”

 

that’s been going on, I think 
this is an easy way to start 
getting 
involved 
and 
for 

survivors to take the first steps 
in sharing their stories,” Cohen 
said. “It’s a great way to have a 
platform that’s comfortable for 
the survivors — that’s on their 
own terms — which is very 
important in our society right 
now.”

Bouse-Eaton 
and 
Cohen 

emphasized their role was 
to facilitate conversation on 
all levels — especially for 
college students. Bouse-Eaton 
identified a lack of awareness 
as 
a 
primary 
obstacle 
to 

making progress with sexual 
violence in society.

“I hope that it opens people’s 

minds if they haven’t thought 
about 
this 
issue 
before,” 

Bouse-Eaton said. “I hope it 
helps survivors in the room 
feel more comfortable coming 
forward, or at least know that 
they are not alone in their 
struggle, and that there are 
people here to support them, 
whether that’s a peer educator, 
a friend in their chapter, a 
boyfriend, a girlfriend, etc.”

To some extent, there has 

been progress toward this goal. 
This is the first Speak Out at 
the University since the advent 
of the #MeToo movement, 
which 
has 
encouraged 

survivors to share their stories 
on social media since late 
last year. The movement has 
brought with it one of the most 
significant ongoing national 
conversations 
about 
sexual 

violence in decades.

The event also carried a 

certain additional weight for 
Michigan 
residents. 
Larry 

Nassar, a former Michigan 
State 
University 
and 
USA 

Gymnastics 
doctor, 
was 

handed a third sentence of 
40 to 125 years in prison on 
Monday, 
following 
three 

weeks of closely watched court 
hearings in which victims 
of his sexual abuse publicly 
testified about his actions.

Perhaps partially catalyzed 

by 
the 
Nassar 
sentencing, 

the #MeToo movement and 
other public events over the 
last 
several 
years, 
Bouse-

Eaton said she has seen more 
survivors come out to share 
their stories with each event.

“It is such a widespread 

problem, but it’s one that we 
haven’t been talking about 
for a long time,” Bouse-Eaton 
said. “I feel like every year, 
it’s gaining momentum; people 
are feeling more comfortable 

saying, ‘Me too.’”

One attendee, who asked 

to remain anonymous, went 
to the event for this purpose 
— to support a platform for 
survivors.

“I wanted to be in a space 

where you can hear people 
share their stories because 
I don’t think they’re shared 
enough,” the attendee said. 
“And I think it’s important to 
have spaces where you can be 
emotional. Sometimes it feels 
like you don’t have enough time 
to do that on this campus.”

The 
attendee 
also 

underscored the importance 
of spreading awareness and 
thinking about how one might 
be facilitating sexual violence 
as a bystander.

Despite the gravity of the 

subject matter, Bouse-Eaton 
expressed 
her 
hope 
and 

confidence that the event — 
and the work of survivors, 
allies and leaders — would lead 
to positive change.

“It’s not really an event 

that you tell people to get 
excited for because it’s very 
emotional and upsetting for a 
lot of people, but it’s also very 
powerful and life-changing,” 
Bouse-Eaton said. “And we tell 
people every year: It’s not fun, 
but it’s important.”

receiving a grant from her alma 
mater, Stanford University. She 
detailed visiting a British castle 
in Ghana, and how its prominent 
structure hid its dark history 
of British officers abuse of their 
Ghanaian wives and other local 
people.

“It’s the only time, I think, 

in my life where I felt like this 
space might be haunted,” Gyasi 
explained. “Where I felt like 
something is happening here that I 
wanted to explore further.”

The experience stuck with her, 

and ultimately motivated her to 
begin her project.

Levy-Hussen said she was 

captivated by the structure of the 
novel.

“What really resonates for me 

was the structure of the novel 
itself,” she said. “It was structured 
as this intergenerational family 
tree.”

While Gyasi said she initially 

intended 
on 
highlighting 
the 

experiences 
of 
four 
people 

in 
two 
different 
generations, 

she 
ultimately 
realized 
the 

importance of time and wanted 
to emphasize it in her writing. 
Therefore, she decided to write 
about the family over the course 
of eight generations, showing 
how successive generations were 
affected by the experiences of their 
ancestors.

Gyasi said she used the structure 

to emphasize the effects of slavery, 
and that slavery continued long 
past the civil war.

“In many ways, this novel felt to 

me like a response to people who 
say things like, ‘Slavery happened 
a 
million 
years 
ago,’” 
Gyasi 

explained.

She then discussed how Aish, a 

character in the novel born after 
the Civil War, was essentially 
treated as a slave while working 
as a sharecropper because of the 
deficiencies of Reconstruction and 
the unjustifiable implementation 
of Jim Crow laws in the south. 

held in West Quad, with around 25 
people in attendance. 

The presentation was divided 

into three segments: Richard 
Spencer 
and 
the 
ethnostate, 

Zionism as a political tactic, and 
the myth of Israel being the only 
democracy in the Middle East. 
Each section was separated by 
10 minute breaks for questions. 
Ultimately, SAFE attempted to 
prove Israel is the kind of model 
ethnostate 
Spencer 
strives 
to 

create. 

The 
presenters 
began 
by 

identifying and defining some 
key terms, including “Zionism” 
and “ethnostate.” One of the 
presenters, an LSA junior who 
requested to remain anonymous to 
avoid potential harm in associating 
her name with these views online, 
gave the definitions. However, she 
also recognized the plurality of 
definitions people may have for 
these terms.

“Zionism has a lot of different 

meanings for a lot of people, but 
this is the working definition for 
the purposes of this presentation: 
a moderate political ideology that 
supports a Jewish nation state,” she 
said. “An ethnostate is a political 
state that is populated by and run 
in the interest of an ethnic group.”

The presentation then moved on 

to highlighting some of Spencer’s 
quotes and interviews that show 
him pointing to Israel as an 
example of an ethnostate, while 
at the same time exhibiting anti-
Semitism. One of the clips was an 
interview with Spencer and an 
Israeli reporter, where Spencer 
defends his supporters’ chants of 

anti-Jewish slogans, while at the 
same time praising Zionism.

In the second section, another 

presenter who also wished to 
remain anonymous due to safety 
concerns, talked about restrictions 
placed on Ethiopian Jews in 
trying 
to 
obtain 
citizenship, 

and the lack of recognition of 
international 
refugees 
within 

the Israeli government. He used 
this as evidence for the Israeli 
government’s aversion to non-
white Jews.

“They want to keep the state 

of Israel to look a certain way and 
to have a certain demographic 
population,” the presenter said. 
“They don’t want people who are 
not white Jews to live in their 
community.”

The third section discussed the 

idea of Israel as an apartheid state, 
citing 
various 
discriminations 

Palestinians 
face, 
including 

eviction 
from 
their 
homes. 

The presenter also referenced 
discriminations 
specifically 

against Palestinian women, such as 
harrassment for wearing religious 
clothing.

During 
the 
question-and-

answer periods between sections, 
there 
were 
multiple 
debates 

between audience members and 
the presenters. These discussions 
centered around topics such as the 
difference between Spencer and a 
typical Zionist, and the difference 
between criticizing Israel and 
criticizing the Israeli government. 
One presenter clarified SAFE’s 
goal was to condemn Israel’s 
policies, but not to discredit the 
entire country.

Jake Ehrlich, a second-year 

student at the school of Social 
Work and a member of the Jewish 
Communal Leadership program, 
said he came to the teach-in to 
understand how people felt about 

the issue.

“I thought it was fruitful, I 

was hoping the content would 
be focused more on specific 
intersections on anti-Semitism, 
philo-semitism, Spencer and the 
alt-right,” Erlich said. “I think 
it sort of slid into more general 
topics, which is fine but was a little 
misleading.”

In direct response to the SAFE 

event, 
students 
at 
Michigan 

Hillel organized an “alternative 
conversation” with Heidi Budaj, 
the regional director of the Anti-
Defamation League, a civil rights 
organization that combats anti-
Semitism 
and 
discrimination. 

More than 80 students gathered 
at Weill Hall Tuesday night for the 
talk.

Budaj 
also 
said 
white 

supremacist 
Richard 
Spencer’s 

request to speak on campus in part 
prompted her lecture.

“The 
other 
catalyst 
as 
to 

why I’m here tonight is because 
Richard Spencer declared that 
he is a Zionist,” Budaj said. 
“Unfortunately some students on 
campus seize upon that and are 
letting that divide minority groups 
on campus when they should be 
working together.”

Budaj’s 
lecture, 
“Alt-Right 

Rising: 
The 
New 
White 

Supremacists” 
was 
held 

immediately after SAFE’s event. 
Budaj rejected Spencer’s alignment 
with Zionism.

“He 
equated 
some 
of 
his 

ideologies with there being a 
Jewish state, but he is ignoring 
diversity that exists throughout 
the state of Israel when he made 
that 
statement,” 
Budaj 
said. 

“Anything that he says is certainly 
not espoused by the Jewish 
community and Zionists are not 
looking for support from someone 
like that.”

LSA senior Sarah Parkes helped 

organize Budaj’s talk. 

“I was upset with some of 

the events that were happening 
on campus that were equating 
white supremacy with Zionism,” 
Parkes said. “A group of students, 
including myself, were really upset 
and wanted to provide a space for 
those with a gut feeling that the 
event that SAFE was putting on 
was a bit anti-Semitic.”

Members of SAFE attended the 

Hillel event after their own talk, at 
times criticizing Israel’s treatment 
of Palestinians. One student, who 
asked not to be named, said Hillel 
originally planned Budaj’s talk to 
overlap with SAFE’s event, and 
criticized the lack of dialogue. 

“SAFE moved their event earlier 

because we wanted to have this 
discussion and we didn’t want 
to be in two separate rooms, so 
that’s why some folks came to our 
talk and we came to this one,” the 
SAFE member said. “I’m surprised 
that that wasn’t brought up, That 
was the literal intention behind the 
talk.”

The student said she took 

further issue with the talk because 
of the way it was initially pitched. 
Originally, the event was titled 
“Equating Zionism with Nazism: A 
Modern Form of Anti-Semitism,” 
but Budaj’s discussion went in 
a 
different 
direction, 
instead 

examining the re-invention and 
subsequent ascent of the alt-right. 

Budaj said Spencer, who coined 

the term alt-right and is the face 
of 
the 
so-called 
identitarian 

movement, represents a “suit and 
tie” faction of white supremacism, 
one that is less overt and more 
subtle. 

eMerge emphasized boosting 
representation of marginalized 
communities through student 
government. Ward, said, however, 
she often felt alienated as a Black 
woman on the assembly. 

“It’s been evident that [students 

of color] have historically been 
silenced due to efforts of other 
members,” Ward said. “I can 
personally attest to this, as I’ve 
had my own alarming experience 
with this, proving it’s true.” 

Following 
the 
meeting, 

Speaker Alexandra Contis, an 
LSA Senior, addressed Ward’s 
resignation in an email statement 
to The Daily, citing interpersonal 
conflict between both parties. 
Contis said she alerted the 
Division of Public Security and 
Safety after a text message she 
received from Ward. 

“The 
morning 
after 
the 

November 28 Assembly meeting 
in which Lauren Ward and I had 
a heated exchange, I received a 
threatening text message from 
Lauren,” Contis wrote. “Because 
of the nature of the text and 
because I was in a university 
building at the time, DPSS was 
called on my behalf.”

The Daily could not confirm 

a corresponding report on the 
DPSS crime log before or after 
Nov. 29. CSG communications 
director Cassie Fields, an LSA 
senior, provided The Daily with 
the alleged texts Ward sent 
Contis.

With elections for next year’s 

CSG officers and representatives 
commencing this semester, much 
of the meeting addressed current 

problems regarding the election 
process and the need to make 
changes 
promptly. 
Proposed 

changes would clarify ambiguity 
in the assembly’s constitution. 

Kinesiology junior Okpalefe 

Edevbie 
emphasized 
the 

importance of ensuring CSG 
elections reflect the values and 
reputation of the organization.

“It’s important as an assembly 

that we start having an open, 
honest, discussion about CSG 
elections,” Edevbie said. “The 
behavior I’ve witnessed falls short 
of the integrity and character 
of this institution, and it’s not 
representative of the values and 
ideas of this assembly.”

LSA 
sophomores 
Sierra 

Stephens and Isabel Baer then 
presented a resolution to support 
mandatory consent and mutual 
respect training for incoming 
University 
theatre 
and 
film 

students. Stephens said drama, 
film 
and 
theatre 
students 

encounter 
many 
classroom 

experiences in which they may 
feel discomfort or non-consensual 
activity, 
which 
reinforces 

the need for supplementary 
training in order to avoid sexual 
misconduct between students.

“It is unacceptable for a student 

to feel uncomfortable or unsafe 
in their learning environment,” 
Baer said. “We pride ourselves on 
being a community of scholars, 
but it’s impossible to learn in an 
environment without respect or 
consent.”

The 
assembly 
concluded 

the meeting by proposing an 
emergency meeting to vote on 
amendments regarding revisions 
of the election code, helping to 
ensure a smooth election process 
in the coming months. The 
emergency meeting is scheduled 
for Wednesday.

W

hen Carl Sagan died 
in 1996, we lost 
one 
of 

the 
world’s 

greatest 
science 

communicators, 
leaving a vacancy 
that 
has 
yet 
to 

be 
filled 
by 
any 

modern 
scientist. 

He 
wrote 
essays 

to 
advocate 
for 

science 
education, 

published books and 
created one of the 
most popular science television 
programs, 
“Cosmos.” 
When 

I was a kid, my grandmother 
would 
record 
television 

programs so I would have 
something to do when my 
family visited. Between the 
episodes 
of 
Adam 
West’s 

“Batman,” I would watch the 
recorded reruns of “Cosmos” 
while sitting on her floor 
eating my Cheerios. I may not 
have understood all the topics 
and concepts at the time, 
but I found it intriguing and 
exciting.

Sagan was able to make 

science enjoyable for everyone. 
He 
presented 
information 

so that someone who didn’t 
know anything about the topic 
could understand it. He really 
stood out in the way he never 
talked down to his audience. 
He made science approachable. 
In an interview with Rolling 
Stone magazine, Sagan said, 
“a lot of my motivation is that 
understanding science is fun. 
It’s communicable fun.” He 
wanted to share his enjoyment 
of science with the public, 
and if you watch any episode 
of “Cosmos,” you can see him 
having fun sharing scientific 
knowledge with his audience. 
We need more people like Carl 
Sagan, those who can bridge 
the gap between the technical 
academic research and the 
public, who should be informed 
on the newest discoveries in 
the world of science.

In the United States today, 

many aspects of science have 
become politicized. Those who 
reject that climate change is 
happening, or deny that humans 
cause it, do so not necessarily 
because they don’t believe in 
science, but because they are 
told by politicians and the 
media that it is not happening. 
They are fed the story by these 
non-scientific sources so much 
that they believe that this is 
the new truth. This is when 
people start questioning the 
authority of scientific experts 
on the subject. They have 
been told one story regularly, 
so when someone comes out 
to 
claim 
otherwise, 
they 

immediately believe whatever 

is being said—even if they 
are the ones conducting the 

studies. 
These 

people have become 
brainwashed 
by 

the 
24/7 
news 

culture 
that 
now 

plagues our society. 
However, 
this 
is 

not the majority of 
people. While some 
people can fall into 
the false narrative, 
many 
people 
can 

smell the B.S but 

there remain few places people 
can go where they feel they are 
being told the truth.

In 
a 
survey 
conducted 

during the summer of 2017 by 
the Pew Research Center, 57 
percent of people responded 
that the media does a good job 
at covering science. This was 
interesting to me because if 
the majority of people think 
the media does a good job at 
covering science, why are so 
many people misinformed? It 
is not that the media ignores 
scientific research, but the 
issue is in the way that the media 
presents these discoveries. In 
the same survey, 73 percent 
of responders said the biggest 
problem 
with 
news 
about 

scientific findings is the way in 
which news reporters cover it, 
while only 24 percent believed 
it was the way the scientists 
published it. I believe that if 
people were able to receive the 
information on discoveries and 
new developments in research 
from 
scientists 
themselves, 

more people would be able to 
trust what they were being 
told. We have become so 
accustomed 
to 
the 
media 

filtering this information for 
us. Scientists need to be more 
aware of how to present their 
findings to the public and build 
a larger public profile.

I don’t want to say there 

are no longer any scientists 
attempting to connect with the 
public. There are examples of 
researchers actively engaging 
with people outside of research. 
On Feb. 25, 2016, just weeks 
after the official announcement 
of the detection of gravitational 
waves, Brian Greene, a professor 
of mathematics and physics at 
Columbia University, appeared 
on The Late Show with Stephen 
Colbert 
to 
promote 
this 

discovery to the audience. He 
was excited and explained the 
discovery in terms that everyone 
could understand. This is the 
kind of interaction that scientists 
need to be making with the 
public about every important 
discovery.

Another public scientist is 

Neil deGrasse Tyson. In 2014, he 
brought back Sagan’s “Cosmos,” 

with great success. Rebooting 
“Cosmos” was well timed with 
the new discoveries being made 
in the field of astrophysics and 
cosmology. It reached a large 
audience 
and 
was 
popular 

enough to be renewed for another 
season. Tyson did a great job 
with the show, however, he often 
acts in ways outside the show 
that could discourage people 
from being interested in science. 
Tyson’s tweets are where he 
is the most condescending. In 
a tweet concerning last year’s 
solar eclipse, Tyson wrote “Total 
Solar Eclipses occur somewhere 
on Earth every two years, or 
so. So just calm yourself when 
people tell you they’re rare”. 
Tyson took a cosmological event 
many people were excited about 
and told them they should “calm” 
themselves. This is the kind 
of interaction with the public 
that leaves a bad impression 
on people. It perpetuates the 
image of a pompous scientist 
and restricts the number of 
people willing to listen to what 
scientists have to say.

In the interview with Rolling 

Stone mentioned earlier, Sagan 
said, “Science, as communicated 
in some places, sounds as if it 
were the last thing in the world 
that 
any 
reasonable 
person 

would want to know about. It’s 
portrayed as impossibly difficult 
to get into and a thing that sort 
of rots your brain for any good 
social interaction.”

This stigma is continued when 

scientists tweet like Tyson and 
talk down to those who are not 
as scientifically knowledgeable 
as them. Those of us in the 
scientific community need to 
work towards reversing this 
stereotype.

I understand that not every 

scientist can be Carl Sagan. If 
every person doing scientific 
research was treated like a 
movie star, they would never 
be able to perform the research 
in the first place. What every 
researcher can do is be open to 
the people they interact with 
every day, share their excitement 
about their work and explain 
why it is important. Those 
with the ability to reach a large 
audience need to be responsible 
and thoughtful with how they 
share their knowledge. The 
conjunction of these approaches 
will lead to a scientifically 
literate public confident in the 
information they receive. This 
will create a culture in which 
we will be able to think critically 
about complex issues and be 
able to push our knowledge of 
the world even further.

S

unday 
night 
at 
6:30 

p.m., the nation came 
together 
to 
watch 
a 

beloved 
American 

tradition: the Super 
Bowl. 
I, 
however, 

was buried in my 
English 
homework 

deep 
within 
the 

Stacks. I consider ed 
this to be my own 
method of protest. It 
served as my mini-
boycott 
against 

what I believe is a 
capitalistic, 
violent 

and deadly sport.

Not that my protest made 

any difference. Over 111 million 
people tuned in to the Super 
Bowl last year, and this year 
viewership peaked around 103 
million. It is a key element of 
American society: People eat, 
sleep and breathe football. 
The NFL receives a massive 
viewership—even 
more, 
it 

makes a lot of money. Franchise 
values 
have 
increased 
30 

percent over the last seven 
years to $1.2 billion. Annual 
revenue is at $9.2 billion. They 
have immeasurable sponsors 
and partnerships. Additionally, 
the NFL dominates television 
— out of the top 10 most 
watched TV programs in 2012, 
the NFL held the first eight 
spots. It is watched and loved 
by all demographics of society, 
regardless of race, gender or 
class. If you’re American, you 
most likely enjoy football.

Despite its successes, new 

and 
disturbing 
studies 
on 

brain degeneration in football 
players have shaken the nation. 
But these findings are only 
new in their exposure, not in 
their discovery. Although it 
seems obvious that repeated, 
aggressive 
pounding 
of 

200-pound bodies will lead 
to health concerns, it was 
only in 2009 when the NFL 
officially acknowledged the 
effects 
of 
long-term 
and 

repeated concussions. More 
than that, it was only in 
2016 
when 
the 
connection 

between football and chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy, a 
degenerative 
brain 
disease, 

was admitted by the NFL’s 
senior adviser for health and 
safety. During the dillydallying 
of this information’s release, 
countless former and current 
players have died due to the 
sport they love. These are 
players who were talented, 
dedicated to and passionate for 
a game whose consequences 
were not fully revealed. They 
accepted 
football’s 
outward 

roughness and injury, but were 

unaware of its inward and 
long-term consequences.

The 
players 
cannot 
be 

entirely 
blamed 

for 
joining 
a 

sport 
that 
is 
so 

obviously harmful. 
The NFL lied for 
years, 
omitting 

information 
about its dangers 
and 
placing 
all 

responsibility 
on 
the 
medical 

community. 
But 

researchers 
have 

been suggesting the relation 
between football and brain 
damage 
since 
1994. 
The 

connection has just always 
been disputed by the League. 
The problem lies in the slow 
but painful development of 
disease; many of the players 
don’t 
experience 
symptoms 

until years after they have 
retired. 
In 
the 
meantime, 

more players get injured, and 
medical arguments lose steam 
and credibility.

For example, when former 

Pittsburgh 
Steelers 
player 

Terry Long committed suicide, 
brain analysis demonstrated 
that he had CTE; however, 
the NFL’s Mild Traumatic 
Brain 
Injury 
Committee 

claimed that the connection 
between 
his 
suicide, 
CTE 

and 
football 
was 
“purely 

speculative.” But it’s not just 
the medical experts, such as 
the MTBI committee, that 
undermine the significance 
of these findings. Coaches are 
guilty of encouraging players 
to continue to play despite 
presenting obvious concussion 
symptoms. For example, New 
England Patriots linebacker 
Ted Johnson was sent back 
on the field, against medical 
caution, just four days after 
his concussion.

We cannot expect players 

to create cautionary measures 
for themselves. Football is 
their job; they must perform 
well for financial reasons, 
to maintain celebrity status 
and to follow the passion that 
made them successful in the 

first place. It is the duty of 
the league to protect them; 
a simple acknowledgment of 
the danger of concussions is 
different and less assertive 
than exposing the long-term 
effects that come with the 
sport. The NFL needs to be 
clear to budding and seasoned 
players alike: If you play, and 
if you play long and hard, you 
have a high risk of developing 
CTE.

Committees like the MTBI 

cannot serve effectively if 
they are clouded by bias; 
many of the members were 
simultaneously 
physicians 

for professional teams. Their 
denial was justified by what 
they claim is confusing and 
unfamiliar research. Andrew 
Tucker, MBTI member and 
Baltimore Ravens physician, 
once stated, “the picture is 
not really complete until we 
have the opportunity to look 
at the same group of people 
over time.” This mentality 
is outrageous, as it basically 
claims a willingness to let 
people die before constructive 
measures can be taken.

With growing knowledge 

and confession by the NFL, 
a certain responsibility also 
falls into the hands of the 
fans. As a person who enjoys 
watching 
soccer, 
I 
know 

how difficult it can be to 
turn your back on something 
that not only brings you 
entertainment, but memories 
and a sense of community. 
NFL fans will not just be 
giving up football if they 
stop watching: They will lose 
the atmosphere and culture 
that comes along with it. I 
believe that this is a minor 
price to pay. Otherwise, they 
are simply accomplices in 
a greater crime. The NFL 
cannot continue neglecting 
the truth if they start to lose 
viewers over it, so we must 
demand for them to change. 
Show your outrage and skip 
the Super Bowl next year. 
Delete your fantasy football 
account. Do not be complicit 
in what is an obvious and 
glorified 
death 
sentence 

for many young, unaware 
and devoted men. Despite 
the overwhelming presence 
of the NFL in American 
society, we are in control of 
its success. If we display our 
distaste, we won’t destroy an 
old tradition: We will create a 
new and important standard 

The price of the Super Bowl

n light of a powerful 
feminist movement that 
has 
reinvigorated 
the 

fight for equality and brought 
together millions in an effort 
to 
fundamentally 
change 

the way women are seen and 
treated in American culture, 
it is important to begin a 
dialogue 
from 
a 
different 

perspective. One that is just 
as important but is quite often 
not given a voice. 

Let’s talk about men, our 

struggles with vulnerability, 
insecurity and our relationship 
with each other as well as with 
the women around us.

There is an expectation in 

our culture that we as men must 
always be powerful, strong 
and composed. Any display of 
emotion is considered to be a 
show of weakness and sharing 
struggles and insecurities is 
socially unacceptable. We are 
always fine, never hurting, 
riding tall on a high horse 
through thick and thin. But 
what happens if we fall? Are 
we allowed to be human, show 
emotion without being judged 
or seen as less of a man?

The truth is, we as men 

often 
feel 
insecure, 
suffer 

from heartaches and struggle 
with our identity, but we keep 
quiet because of the immense 
pressure 
to 
maintain 
our 

masculinity. We are expected 
to sustain a “manly facade” by 
participating in competitive 

sports, 
going 
to 
the 
gym 

to 
build 
our 
bodies 
and 

achieving financial success. 
This 
pressure 
from 
both 

men and women in our lives 
has created a culture that is 
slowly destroying our ability 
to have deep and meaningful 
relationships 
with 
those 

around us.

I know that in my own 

life, I have often put up a 
brick wall to hide my pain, 
even from people who have 
shown 
me 
unconditional 

love and support. I did not 
feel comfortable sharing my 
emotions with others because 
I was terrified of being seen 
as less of a man. I stood strong 
when I was weak and acted 
confident when I felt insecure, 
all in an effort to protect my 
image. Our culture taught me 
that vulnerability is weakness 
and it was only until recently 
through self-reflection and 
meditation that I began to 
understand vulnerability is 
the purest form of courage.

We all have flaws, but also 

the ability to acknowledge 
and share them with the 
world. The world is what 
connects us and helps us 
realize that deep down we 
all want the same things. We 
want to be loved, understood, 
make a difference and believe 
that we are enough. The 
absence of honest and open 
connection between men has 

created a culture that does 
not fulfill these basic human 
needs 
and 
has 
negatively 

affected our community for 
generations.

We must start an honest 

dialogue to question why 
men are always expected to 
be strong and why emotion, 
pain and struggle are seen 
as weakness. These are not 
male or female issues, these 
are human issues and they 
can only be solved through 
joint collaboration as well 
as a fundamental change in 
culture.

So as men, let’s do our part: 

Join the feminist movement, 
question 
cultural 
norms 

and fight for equality. Let’s 
talk to each other about our 
struggle with body image, 
heartbreak and insecurity. 
Let’s talk about how we treat 
women and let’s talk about 
the pressure to be strong even 
when our lives are falling 
apart.

I challenge us to fully 

and 
honestly 
acknowledge 

when we are hurting and to 
develop real and vulnerable 
relationships with the people 
around us.

I challenge us to work 

together with women to start 
a movement that redefines 
what it means to be a man.

It’s hard not to fall in love 
with Jessica Williams (“The 
Incredible 
Jessica 
James”) 
and Phoebe Robinson (“Broad 
City”). The two best friends 
— both outspoken New York-
based comedians who host 
the aptly titled podcast “2 
Dope 
Queens” 
— 
not 
only 
have 
infectious 
personalities 
and a magnetic 
rapport, but are 
also 
intensely 
attuned to almost 
everything 
happening 
in 
pop 
culture. 
Whether 
it’s 
dishing about the 
latest Hollywood 
gossip, 
introducing new 
comics 
to 
the 
stage or illuminating issues 
important to Black women, 
Williams and Robinson have 
accrued a healthy amount of 
deserved 
attention 
through 
“2 Dope Queens.” And what 
better way to realize that 
potential 
than 
through 
a 
deliciously 
profane 
and 
immensely entertaining four-
part HBO comedy special?
Like “2 Dope Queens” the 
podcast, “2 Dope Queens” the 
HBO special gives Williams 
and Robinson a platform to talk 
about the timeliest topics, but 
also manages to finesse their 
chemistry just as effectively 
on-screen. Part of what makes 
the HBO adaptation of “2 Dope 
Queens” so successful is how 
much 
spirit 
Williams 
and 
Robinson fill within an hour.
On their podcast, Williams 
and Robinson would spend the 
first few moments delivering 
some 
cheeky 
observational 
humor — usually about Bono or 
Beyoncé — before transitioning 

into the rest of the show, all of 
which is live and replete with 
celebrity interviews, stand-
up sets from up-and-coming 
and 
established 
comedians 
or Williams and Robinson 
exchanging 
more 
witty, 
incisive banter. This structure 
works 
to 
their 
advantage 
visually 
as 
well; 
HBO’s 
cinematic production values 
bolster “2 Dope Queens”’s 
appeal — matching the queens’ 
brand of topical, 
niche 
humor 
with the iconic 
ornateness of the 
Kings 
Theatre 
and 
a 
colorful 
stage resembling 
a 
Brooklyn 
rooftop 
in 
the 
summer. 
The first part, 
“New 
York,” 
captures 
this 
aesthetic charm 
in 
its 
opening 
sketch, 
wherein 
a 
stubborn, 
oblivious attendant brushes 
off Williams and Robinson 
for 
not 
having 
tickets 
to 
their 
own 
show. 
As 
they 
Google themselves to confirm 
their 
identities, 
Williams 
and Robinson refer to this 
situation as “Black-on-Black 
aggression,” 
a 
phrase 
the 
two often jokingly use when 
making light of racial disparity 
within the Black community. 
Though very brief, the bit alone 
demonstrates Williams and 
Robinson’s comedic talent and 
timing, especially considering 
the former was a “Daily Show” 
correspondent and the latter 
has a healthy pedigree of 
sketch comedy experience. 
“New York” continues to 
enthrall, 
as 
Robinson 
and 
Williams 
welcome 
their 
audience 
with 
the 
same 
rowdy, high-ball energy they 
incorporate into their podcast. 
They invite a string of stand-
up comics — Michelle Buteau 
(“Key 
and 
Peele”), 
Mark 

Normand (“Horace and Pete”) 
and Baron Vaughn (“Grace 
and Frankie”) — each of whom 
offers an equally dynamic and 
distinctive set of personal 
stories and observations on 
New York culture. Williams’s 
old boss Jon Stewart (“The 
Daily 
Show”) 
makes 
an 
appearance, 
his 
segment 
dedicated to discussing New 
York “moments” and taste-
testing New York pizza, which 
wouldn’t be nearly as satisfying 
if it were just recorded. 
While “New York” has a 
stronger opening, the second 
episode, “Hair,” is centered on 
a more grounded issue — Black 
hair and the complex discourse 
surrounding it. “Hair” also 
includes a consistently funnier 
lineup of stand-up acts — 
Aparna Nancherla (“BoJack 
Horseman”), 
Rhea 
Butcher 
(“Take My Wife”) and Sheng 
Wang (“Fresh Off the Boat”) 
— and the unexpected arrival 
of fan favorite Sarah Jessica 
Parker (“Sex and the City”). 
Parker’s earnest attempt to 
learn more about Black hair 
from Robinson and Williams 
drives her segment away from 
being an awkward display 
of 
“white 
cluelessness” 
— 
an issue that Robinson and 
Williams discuss and exploit 
in their podcast, sometimes to 
a fault.
For 
those 
familiar 
(and 
even unfamiliar) with “2 Dope 
Queens” as a podcast, the HBO 
special 
does 
an 
admirable 
job of bringing Robinson and 
Williams’s moxie to television, 
even if it doesn’t experiment 
with the podcast’s structural 
formula. The first two episodes 
are both fairly breezy for an 
hour, though they occasionally 
lag during extended jokes that 
lose steam pretty quickly. Still, 
“2 Dope Queens” remains a 
testament to Robinson and 
Williams as an unstoppable 
comedic duo, as pop culture 
commentators and as badass 
forces of nature.

‘2 Dope Queens’ podcast is 
matched by smart special

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

This weekend it was my turn 
to meet a stranger at a concert.
In my defense, I didn’t sign 
up to do that. About a week ago, 
I had signed up to review the 
Estonian National Symphony 
concert at Hill Auditorium. 
I have always been a fan 
of conductor Neeme Järvi, 
particularly 
his 
recordings 
of the Sibelius symphonies 
and 
his 
performance 
of 
Pärt’s “Cantus for Benjamin 
Britten” from the BBC Proms. 
When emailing for my press 
ticket to the event, I assumed 
that I would be sitting in an 
upper 
balcony 
somewhere, 
presumably far away from the 
ticket-paying audience.
After arriving at the concert, 
however, I was seated in a 
mostly empty row next to an 
elderly woman. I prepared as I 
usually do for a review, reading 
through the program with 
a pen and circling a couple 
of ideas that I might want 
to refer to later. After about 
five minutes of circling and 
reading, the woman next to 
me asked me what I was doing. 
Was I at this concert for a class, 
she asked?
I briefly explained that I 
was a writer for The Michigan 
Daily. I tried to start a light 
conversation, asking if she was 
a fan of Järvi as I was. After 
talking for a bit the lights went 
down and the concert began.
First on the program was 
Heino 
Eller’s 
“Homeland 
Tune,” the fifth movement 
from his “Five Pieces for String 
Orchestra.” Eller, I learned, is 
one of Estonia’s more famous 
composers, having been Arvo 
Pärt’s 
primary 
composition 
teacher. 
Järvi 
entered 
the 
stage to tremendous applause, 
obviously enjoying the cheers 

of 
a 
friendly 
crowd. 
He 
began the first piece almost 
immediately, the applause of 
the audience fading suddenly 
into the calm, chordal opening 
of “Homeland Tune.” While 
this piece was definitely not 
the most adventurous work 

on the program, it was a 
pleasant six-minute opening 
to the concert. The orchestra 
responded brilliantly to Järvi’s 
every move — the crescendos 
and 
decrescendos 
reaching 
incredibly expressive levels of 
subtlety. I found myself being 
drawn into a lull throughout 
the piece, easily losing myself 
in the fabric of the work.
Next was Brahms’s “Piano 
Concerto No. 1 in D Minor,” 
a 
tricky 
but 
rewarding 
piece. 
It 
opened 
with 
a 
long introduction from the 
orchestra, the winds and brass 
having entered the stage after 
the first performance. Garrick 
Ohlsson, the piano soloist for 

the evening, demonstrated his 
interpretative ability during 
the slower portions of the first 
movement. The slower passages 
were 
captivating; 
Ohlsson’s 
ability to give repeated phrases 
new meanings was incredible. 
The cadenza in the second 
movement 
was 
absolutely 
stunning. At one point, it felt 
as if time itself was slowing 
down. The third movement 
was seamless too, the energy 
from the opening passages 
seeming to fade over the 
entire movement into the slow 
ending.
Ohlsson’s performance was 
met with almost instantaneous 
applause. As a quick encore, 
he 
played 
Rachmaninoff’s 
“Prelude in C-sharp, Op. 3 No. 
2.” This most famous of all 
Rachmaninoff’s preludes was 
neither too rushed nor too slow, 
Ohlsson’s incredibly engaging 
way of playing repeated pieces 
breathing new life into the 
work. This was met with two 
more rounds of applause, the 
audience begging for another 
encore.
During the intermission, I 
talked with the woman sitting 
to my right. She is an alumni 
of both the undergraduate 
and graduate programs here 
at the University and has 
been living in Ann Arbor ever 
since. We talked a bit about 
the University Musical Society 
and the tremendous growth it 
underwent while she lived in 
Ann Arbor.
She 
explained 
that 
she 
was from the Detroit area 
and that she had gone home 
to study the week before 
finals her freshman year. The 
night before her final, as she 
prepared to go to sleep, her 
dad came to ask her where her 
final was the next morning. 
After explaining that her final 
was in Haven Hall, her dad 
had unbelievable news: Haven 

TV REVIEW

 Just in time for the release 
of the “Black Panther” 
soundtrack this Friday 
(which looks amazing), Ken-
drick Lamar and SZA have 
shared the 
music video for 
their newest 
collaboration 
“All The Stars,” 
an airy single 
off the film’s 
soundtrack. 
Framed by 
an electronic 
dance beat and 
soaring vocals, the song bold-
ly declares the grandeur that 
can be found in love and per-
severance. It’s a song meant 
for royalty, perfectly match-
ing the narrative of “Black 
Panther,” which is centered 
around African nobility.
 The music video fits the 
film’s premise to an even 
stronger degree. The first 

shot depicts a regal Lamar 
standing on a boat, buoyed 
by a sea of waving hands; the 
strength of his posture makes 
him appear carved out of 
stone, a position 
of fortitude that 
he maintains as 
the pre-chorus 
of “Love, let’s 
talk about love 
/ Is it anything 
and everything 
you hoped 
for?” leads him 
into the open 
embrace of a matriarchal 
figure. Her stature is sur-
real; larger-than-life, she 
looms over Lamar, protecting 
within the folds of her robe 
a crowd of children. The hue 
of each of their crimson hats 
adds to the overall splendor, 
and Lamar cuts a path to the 
group’s center like Moses 
parting the Red Sea.

 As SZA takes over the 
chorus, we are taken to the 
heavens, zooming in on a 
depiction of Africa made 
entirely out of stars until 
the outline is magnified to 
abstraction until there is 
only SZA dancing amid the 
swirling nebula of space, as 
she croons “All the stars are 
closer.”
 This music video glows. 
Each individual featured is 
costumed in bright colors 
and striking patterns, and 
their backdrops are equally 
vibrant: electric blue jungles 
and intricate gold throne 
rooms. “All The Stars” honors 
the beauty in love, in ancestry 
and, most importantly, in the 
many complexities of a cul-
tural heritage that has often 
been diminished by stereo-
types and generalization.

Fridays @ 11:30 p.m.

Hall had burned down earlier 
that night! The next day, after 
arriving back on campus, she 
learned that it was true. Haven 
Hall was destroyed in a fire on 
Jun. 6, 1950. She took her final 
in Hill Auditorium, leaning on 
clipboards in the first rows of 
the audience as her professor 
paced the stage.
At this point, it was time 
for the second half of the 
program to begin, and though 
I had many questions about 
the fire and her experiences 
at the University, I turned and 
applauded as the orchestra 
re-entered the stage. This was 
Eduard Tubin’s “Symphony No. 
5 in B Minor,” a roaring work 
for full orchestra featuring two 
timpanists placed on opposite 
ends of the back portion of 
the stage. Tubin is another 
composer 
who 
I 
was 
not 
familiar with, though I soon 
learned that he was another 
famous 
Estonian 
composer. 
He had fled the Soviet Union 
in 1944 and resided in Sweden 
for most of his life. This work 
was full of quick, aggressive 
passages — particularly in the 
brass. The biting sound of the 
bass trombone and the muted 

rotary valve flugelhorns was 
quite 
frightening, 
as 
were 

the thundering sounds of two 
timpanis playing loudly in 
unison. It was a captivating, 
almost frenetic work, and it 

demonstrated the orchestra’s 
ability to navigate fast music 
with ease.
As the second round of 
applause began, the woman 
sitting next to me waved 
goodbye. It was past 10:00, 
she explained, and she had to 
get home. Her sudden arrival 
felt like the proper ending to 
the entire evening: The works 
of 
unfamiliar 
composers 
paired with my accidentally 
meeting a friendly stranger, 
the 
eclectic 
peculiarity 
of 
the repertoire on the concert 
paired with the peculiarity 
of my experience and the odd 
familiarity of the music paired 
with the friendly nature of this 
charming woman. It reminded 
me to constantly be open to 
new 
experiences. 
Though 
I knew nothing before that 
concert of Estonian composers 
or Estonian classical music, I 
have two new pieces to listen 
to and become familiar with. 
And though I knew little about 
the history of Haven Hall and 
Hill Auditorium before that 
concert, I have an interesting 
story to tell now of a first-hand 
account of the University’s 
history.

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

I like romantic comedies 
as much as the next person. 
In fact, I’d hazard that I like 
them quite a bit more than 
the next person. The easy, 
predictable textures of the plot 
and 
characters, 
the 
willing 
suspension 
of 
disbelief, 
the 
insistence 
that 
all 
problems 
can 
be 
solved 
with 
the 
right 
combination 
of 
words, 
timing 
and flowers — it’s 
formulaic, sure, 
but the formula 
works. It’s the 
marshmallow 
fluff 
of 
the 
entertainment 
world: devoid of substance but 
hard to resist. That’s why I was 
surprised to find that Rachel 
Joyce’s new novel, “The Music 
Shop” — a romantic comedy 
in book form if ever there was 
one — fails to deliver the sugar 
rush it promised.
“The Music Shop” opens in 
1988 on Frank, “a gentle bear 
of a man” who owns a derelict 
music shop and refuses to 
sell anything more modern 
than vinyl records, even as 
the rest of the world becomes 
enamored with CDs. Frank 
has a preternatural ability 
to divine what song a person 
needs to hear to overcome the 
challenges in their life; Joyce 
describes finding the right 
song as “meeting a stranger 
in the dark, saying to them, 
‘You’ll 
never 
guess 
what?’ 
and 
the 
stranger 
saying, 
‘Hey, but that’s exactly how 
it is for me.’” This ability and 
Frank’s somewhat overdrawn 
selflessness has made him 
beloved in his community of 

quirky shop owners: Maud, the 
tough-as-nails tattoo artist; 
Father Anthony, the ex-priest 
and owner of a religious gift 
shop; the Williams brothers, 
identical 
twin 
funeral 
directors; and Kit, Frank’s 
hapless and overeager shop 
assistant. 
Nevermind 
that 
this cast of zany characters is 
drawn 
directly 
from films like 
“You’ve 
Got 
Mail” and “Four 
Weddings 
and 
a 
Funeral,” 
or 
that 
the 
fact 
that this tight-
knit 
community 
centered 
on 
“Unity 
Street” 
is 
almost 
too 
sickly-sweet 
to 
mention. 
With 
the 
exception 
of Kit, who is at 
times 
genuinely 
hilarious, more often than 
not 
these 
characters 
border 
on 
caricature, and 
the suspension 
of 
disbelief 
required 
by 
the 
reader 
to 
imagine 
them 
as 
anything 
more than one-
dimensional is 
slight at best.
Enter 
Ilse 
Brauchmann, 
a 
beautiful 
woman 
with 
a 
mysterious 
past 
who 
brings 
color 
into 
Frank’s 
life (think “Notting Hill”). In 
the style of the classic meet-
cute, she and Frank connect 
instantly: “Their eyes locked 
and everything else gave way 
and disappeared.” But Ilse 
is engaged to another man, 
and Frank has to be satisfied 

with the weekly music lessons 
he 
gives 
her. 
Joyce 
can’t 
be entirely blamed for the 
cheesiness of this line or the 
romance that grows around it; 
she’s working within a genre, 
and certain traditions have to 
be (begrudgingly) respected. 
But convention can turn very 
quickly into cliché, and Frank 
and Ilse’s fledgling romance, 
and the obstacles in its way — 
Frank’s inability to let himself 
be loved, Ilse’s hesitation to 
reveal her secrets — can feel 
too contrived to keep the 
reader invested. At some point, 
you want to shout, “Get over it 
already! We know you’ll get 
together in the end anyway!”
Joyce struggles in this book 
to find the line between charm 
and kitsch. The story has good 
bones: 
Joyce’s 
impressive 
depth of knowledge about 
and passion for music, her 
sensitivity to suffering, her 
insistence upon the power 
of love to heal 
and 
redeem. 
It would make 
a 
good 
movie, 
with the perfect 
amount of heft 
and 
heart 
to 
fill a 90-minute 
escape 
from 
the world. But 
the same things 
that 
would 
make it a hit if 
Julia 
Roberts 
and Hugh Grant 
were 
to 
play 
it 
on-screen 
become 
lost 
in 
translation 
on 
the 
page. 
Without 
the 
substance 
to 
support 
the 
longer format of a novel, the 
charm of the “The Music Shop” 
becomes both overplayed and 
hollow, like a soufflé that’s 
risen too high and caves in on 
itself, leaving the reader with 
nothing but a toothache.

BOOK REVIEW

 Snoop Dogg is back. How-
ever, the Doggfather is return-
ing not as “gangsta,” but as 
preacher. Last week, Snoop 
released a string 
of four gos-
pel singles to 
accompany the 
announcement 
of a new album, 
Bible of Love. 
The tracks, 
each featuring 
a powerhouse vocalist, are 
the most musically rich and 
dynamic we’ve ever heard 
from the founding father of 
G-funk: Gospel choirs, piano, 
organ, vocal runs, clapping 
— the whole nine yards. Most 
interestingly, Snoop’s rhymes 
are only featured on one of 
the four songs, “Blessing Me 
Again (ft. Rance Allen),” the 
rest dominated by gospel vocal 
chops.

 Needless to say, Snoop’s 
newest project reflects the 
rapper’s biggest career pivot 
yet. Sure, we’ve seen multiple 
carnations of 
the D.O. Double 
G: From his 
revolutionary 
debut album, 
Doggystyle, to 
his pop single 
with Katy Perry, 
“California 
Gurls,” Snoop has been all 
over the map, arguably as 
much as any rapper could be. 
Yet, this religiously driven 
music is something Snoop has 
never touched, and the move 
raises some questions: Has he 
reinvigorated his faith? Does 
he feel especially blessed after 
reflecting on the fortunes of 
his career? Does he simply feel 
secure enough as an artist to 
pursue a venture into gospel? 

With lyrics like “I got a whole 
lot that I can really thank Him 
for / When I was moving fast, 
He had to slow my roll” and 
“Seems like He testing me 
again / But on the flip side, it’s 
like He blessing me again,” all 
three motivations seem pos-
sible.
 Either way, the tracks them-
selves are enjoyable to listen 
to. Overwhelmingly positive, 
they are a breath of fresh air 
during what many consider a 
time of general strife, which 
is perhaps the effect Snoop 
was pursuing. The best part: 
As gospel as these singles are, 
they still retain a hint of hip 
hop, with big bass and 808s, 
providing a nice cross-genre 
blend that will get listeners on 
their feet in the name of the 
Lord.

The actual story behind the 
Winchester Mystery House is an 
interesting one. After the deaths 
of her husband and daughter, 
Sarah Winchester 
became 
the 
majority 
shareholder 
in 
the 
lucrative 
Winchester 
Repeating 
Arms 
Company 
and 
moved 
into 
an 
unfinished 
farmhouse 
in 
Cali. She used her 
fortune to build a 
haphazard seven-
story mansion that 
became 
famous 
for 
stairs 
that 
went 
nowhere, 
windows looking into other 
rooms and other architectural 
oddities.
Some 
believed 
that 
the 
construction, 
which 
would 
continue day and night for 38 
years until Winchester’s death 
in 1922, was a hobby to help the 
widow and mother cope with her 
grief, while others maintained 
that she believed her family was 
haunted by the ghosts killed by 
Winchester firearms and that 
the house was built to contain 
their spirits. “Winchester: The 
House That Ghosts Built” looks 
to adapt the tale of the titular 
Mystery House and firearms 
heiress by focusing on the 
supposed family curse. What 
could have been a thought-
provoking psychological horror 

story about the effects of grief 
is instead watered down into a 
boring, derivative flick fueled 
by thoughtless jump scares and 
a script that mistakes repetitive 
dialogue for thematic heft and 
character development.
This 
would 
have 
been 
disappointing 
if 
“Winchester” just 
had its premise 
going for it, but 
it’s 
fronted 
by 
Helen 
Mirren 
(“Collateral 
Beauty”) in the 
title 
role 
and 
Jason 
Clarke 
(“Mudbound”) 
playing 
the 
psychiatrist 
sent 
to 
evaluate 
her 
mental health, two 
incredibly talented 
performers 
who 
are 
given 
nothing to work with. There’s 
no 
relationship 
that 
builds 
between them, though the script 
pretends otherwise. Neither is at 
all engaging beyond the names 
behind them. Instead, they’re 
just 
points-of-view 
for 
the 
audience to experience the next 
jump scare.
To 
its 
credit, 
the 
script 
— co-written by the Spierig 
Brothers (“Jigsaw”), who also 
direct — tries to give Clarke’s Eric 
Price an arc, but his development 
is so muddy that it’s difficult 
to pin down exactly how we’re 
supposed to see him changing. 
Is he supposed to be recovering 
from the guilt of his wife’s death, 
as the third act implies? Is he 
overcoming his skepticism, as 
his dialogue, which consists 

almost entirely of him saying, 
“Fear is all in your head” to 
everyone — including himself — 
would support? There’s a play at 
combining the two ideas, but like 
the movie itself, it never resolves 
into anything coherent.
Meanwhile, Mirren, one of the 
best actresses of her generation, 
walks around acting like a 
medium on a third-tier reality 
TV show. “Oh,” she says at one 
point, her hands fluttering about 
as if swatting at invisible flies, 
“this spirit is so angry. It has a 
power we’ve not seen before.” 
The silliness of her performance 
is outmatched only by Eamon 
Farren (“Twin Peaks”) as Ben 
Block, another visitor to the 
Winchester house. Farren, a 
native 
Australian, 
affects 
a 
Southern accent so ludicrous it’s 
as if he injected molasses directly 
into his veins. Given his seeming 
omnipresence, he’s likely meant 
to be a foreboding presence, but 
with a drawl like the love child 
of Foghorn Leghorn and Colonel 
Sanders, it’s impossible to take 
him in any way seriously.
When horror is good, it 
possesses an ability to examine 
the human psyche that no other 
genre can lay claim to. The story 
behind Sarah Winchester and 
the house she built begs to be 
given this treatment, but the 
Spierig Brothers are apparently 
content with something lesser. 
Instead of genuine scares, we 
have deformed faces pop out 
while the music blasts. Instead of 
interesting mythology, we have a 
movie that wantonly violates its 
own rules. Instead of ingenuity, 
we have Jason Clarke shooting 
and killing a ghost.

‘Winchester’ is laughably 
inept at producing horror

Notebook: Michigan hoping to cut down on penalties, LaFontaine sees the ice

Last weekend in the Michigan 

hockey team’s critical series 
with No. 17 Wisconsin, there 
was no shortage of punches 
thrown from either team. With 
rivalry games against in-state 
foe Michigan State on the 
horizon for the Wolverines, 
physicality and aggression are 
likely to play a role once again.

And though not all penalties 

are avoidable, Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson thinks his team has 
been taking too many of what he 
describes as “selfish penalties.” 
Given this, discipline has been a 
major talking point of practice 
this week. 

“We 
just 
talk 
about 
it,” 

Pearson said. “And just play 
whistle to whistle. … And I 
think you’re willing to take a 
few penalties, but it’s the ones 
that aren’t team penalties — and 
I call those the selfish penalties 
— where you retaliate for a hit 
you didn’t like. And we talk 
about the emotional control to 
your game because the game is 
hype, you’re on the edge and you 
can get your aggression out by 
playing clean whistle to whistle.

“It’s hard though. It’s a rival 

and there’s a lot of stuff going 
on on the ice. But you have to 
stay in the game and play for the 
team.”

Pearson highlighted senior 

forward Dexter Dancs’ second 
period roughing penalty Friday 
night as an example. After taking 
a hit along the boards, Dancs 
proceeded to retaliate instead 
of restraining himself. Due to 
a coaching decision, Dancs was 
benched in Saturday’s game for 
the first time this season.

But this week, Dancs has 

already made great strides with 
regards to his work ethic and 
discipline in practice. It hasn’t 
gone unnoticed.

“I like Dexter,” Pearson said. 

“I like Dexter Dancs this week. 
He’s been fabulous. I like the 
energy that he’s brought to 

practice and we haven’t seen 
that for a while. And whether it’s 
not playing a game, or whatever 
it is, he’s a senior and he doesn’t 
have many kicks at the can so 
to speak. …And every once in a 
while you need a little bit of a 
wake-up call or reality check. 
And I think that maybe was it 
with Dexter.”

And demonstrating discipline 

is not just necessary to be seen 
from senior leadership, but up 
and down the roster as well. The 
past weekend, penalties were 
drawn by Michigan players of 
every class.

But 
the 
significance 
of 

exhibiting this self control is not 
lost on the newest members of 
the team.

“I think there’s a difference 

between 
playing 
aggressive, 

competing 
hard 
and 
being 

undisciplined,” said freshman 
forward Jack Becker. “So I think 

it’s just playing between the 
whistles and not getting into 
the extracurriculars after the 
whistles, like all of the chirping 
and talking.”

Eyes on the PairWise
With three weekends left 

until 
the 
postseason, 
the 

PairWise Rankings are getting 
harder and harder to ignore.

A statistical ranking tool, the 

PairWise indicates the teams 
that will be in the running 
for selection to the NCAA 
Tournament, which begins in 
late March.

At the end of last season, the 

Wolverines finished 37th in the 
PairWise, a far cry from a top-16 
tournament bid. But the 2017-18 
season is telling a very different 
story. Following its series split 
with Wisconsin, Michigan has 
been inching up in the ranking 
system, currently sitting at 15th. 
Just moving up a few more spots 

when the season ends would 
almost guarantee a tournament 
spot.

And though Pearson believes 

that his team should maintain 
focus on the games that lie 
ahead of it, the rankings have 
certainly been on the minds of 
him and the rest of the coaching 
staff.

“Do you want me to lie?” 

Pearson joked after practice on 
Tuesday. “We don’t talk about 
it with our team much but as 
coaches, we keep an eye on it. …
It could affect decisions a little 
bit as far as who you play. Do 
you play a shorter bench, do you 
pull your goalie earlier in games 
now maybe if you’re behind? So 
I think you have to have a pulse 
on what’s going on and where 
you’re at.”

This 
awareness 
of 
the 

rankings includes the coaches 
watching the games of other 

teams 
that 
are 
close 
to 

Michigan’s positioning in the 
PairWise. But in regards to 
conversations with the team, 
all that is discussed is working 
to make the Wolverines better 
every day and how to find 
success in their next outing.

“You want them to feel that 

encouragement,” Pearson said. 
“If (the current ranking) makes 
them play harder, if that makes 
them play better, you can use 
that. But we tend to stay on the 
safe side and worry about the 
things we can control, and that 
will take care of itself.”

And the players seem to be 

maintaining this positive outlook 
and not overemphasizing the 
rankings, while still keeping 
them in mind.

“I mean, it’s definitely hard 

to not pay attention to them, 
because it kind of tells you 
if your season is going to go 

longer,” said freshman forward 
Mike Pastujov. “But really, right 
now we’re just trying to finish 
out the end of our season and get 
as many wins as possible.”

LaFontaine sees the ice
Since 
the 
calendar 
year 

flipped, 
sophomore 
Hayden 

Lavigne had been Michigan’s 
go-to in the net. Given this, 
his classmate Jack LaFontaine 
hadn’t 
seen 
any 
playing 

time since the Great Lakes 
Invitational.

That 
was 
until 
Saturday 

night, when the Wolverines’ 
four-goal deficit in the second 
period sent LaFontaine in to 
replace Lavigne. In his late-
game outing, LaFontaine made 
18 saves, allowing no goals, 
making the loss sting a little 
less.

Though it didn’t take place 

at an ideal time, Pearson noted 
that LaFontaine’s ability to step 
up and play when Michigan 
needed him was commendable.

“It’s unfortunate that he had 

to go in in that circumstance 
because obviously Hayden had 
a tough night, but in a way it 
was good because Jack got an 
opportunity to get in there and 
get some minutes in,” Pearson 
said. “ …And it was almost two 
periods of shutout hockey for 
him, which was good.”

Given this, Pearson made 

clear that Lavigne is still the 
clear starter, as he earned 
himself the spot. The netminder 
had a stellar showing Friday 
night, saving 37 pucks, bailing 
out Michigan in its 5-3 win. 
But with LaFontaine proving 
competitive 
as 
well, 
the 

Wolverines do not have to worry 
on nights that Lavigne doesn’t 
play his best game.

“If Hayden plays like he did 

Friday night, it will be tough 
for Jack to get in,” Pearson said. 
“Now if Hayden plays like he did 
Saturday, the door is open. It’s 
Hayden’s job, he’s the starter. 
And if he continues to play 
well he will continue to get the 
starts.”

Michigan coach Mel Pearson is pleased with how senior forward Dexter Dancs has played this week and praised the energy Dancs has brought to practice.

Harbaugh, Michigan slated for quiet National Signing Day

Jim Harbaugh is set to sign his 

fourth recruiting class as head 
coach of the Michigan football 
team.

National 
Signing 
Day 
is 

Wednesday, and the Wolverines 
currently 
have 
the 
nation’s 

17th-best 
recruiting 
class, 

according to 247Sports. That’s 
currently off the pace Harbaugh 
set the previous two years as 
Michigan signed the No. 5 and 
No. 8 classes in 2017 and 2016, 
respectively.

That’s not the only difference 

this year, either. While with 
previous 
classes 
there 
was 

usually a flurry of activity near 
signing day, it’s been quiet 
this year — much more quiet. 
With the addition of an early 
signing period in December, the 

Wolverines — and many teams 
around the country — have 
already signed a large proportion 
of their class.

But that’s not to say that 

national signing day won’t be 
without its stakes. Michigan 
is hoping to hold onto its top-
ranked 
recruit 
in 
four-star 

linebacker Otis Reese. As a 
6-foot-4, 206-pound prospect 
from Leesburg, Ga., Reese is 
currently the subject of a spirited 
recruiting battle between the 
Wolverines and Georgia. Reese 
took several visits to see his 
hometown team play during 
the regular season. He took an 
official visit to Michigan on Jan. 
19 before taking one more trip to 
Athens on Jan. 26.

Reese is the former high school 

teammate of freshman defensive 
tackle Aubrey Solomon, who 
committed to Michigan on the 

same day as Reese in the summer 
of 2016.

While the Wolverines may be 

waiting for Reese’s signature, 
it will be a significant amount 
of time before they gain the 
signature of another prospect 
who 
had 
previously 
been 

committed.

Kevin Doyle, a three-star 

quarterback, 
announced 
his 

intentions on Feb. 4 to sign with 
a school other than Michigan.

“Thank you Coach Hamilton 

and Coach Harbaugh for the 
opportunity,” Doyle wrote in a 
statement posted on Twitter. “I 
am officially decommitted from 
the University of Michigan. I 
will be signing with a new school 
on Wednesday, Feb. 7th.” 

Doyle had been committed to 

the Wolverines since Sept. 24 
after a whirlwind recruitment. 
He 
told 
Scout.com 
that 

Michigan’s 
courtship 
began 

after Hamilton watched one of 
his games on television.

Doyle, the Gatorade State 

Football Player of the Year 
for Washington, D.C., visited 
during the Air Force game 
and 
committed 

shortly 
after 

that. 
His 

decommitment 
leaves 
the 

Wolverines with 
one quarterback 
for the class in 
four-star 
Joe 

Milton, 
who 

signed 
at 
the 

early 
deadline 

and 
enrolled 

for the winter semester. Milton 
will be one of four scholarship 
quarterbacks on the roster next 
season, along with sophomore 
Shea 
Patterson, 
redshirt 

freshman Brandon Peters and 
freshman Dylan McCaffrey.

Doyle’s departure may have 

put a dent in the class. But it 
wasn’t too long before Michigan 
earned 
another 
commitment, 

this time from kicker Jake 

Moody.

Moody 

tweeted 
his 

decision 
to 

commit to the 
Wolverines 
on Feb. 4, the 
same day Doyle 
announced 
his 

decommitment.

“This has been 

the 
toughest 

decision in my 

life,” Moody wrote. “After sitting 
down and talking with my 
family, I have decided to commit 
to the University of Michigan.”

Moody, a native of Northville, 

is regarded as one of the top prep 
kickers in the nation. He told 
hometownlife.com that he may 
greyshirt, which would mean 
signing a letter of intent while 
delaying enrollment until the 
winter semester. In that scenario, 
Moody would essentially sit 
out his freshman season while 
retaining full eligibility.

“If the scholarship isn’t there 

this fall, then I would probably 
greyshirt, 
and 
that 
would 

probably give me a buffer year 
in between Quinn (Nordin),” 
Moody told hometownlife. “And 
if I grey-shirted, I could also 
redshirt if I wanted to if it looked 
like I couldn’t play. Then I could 
get two years in between Quinn.”

The 
Wolverines 
currently 

have 
20 
players 
committed, 

with eight ranked as four-star 
prospects and 12 ranked as 
three-star prospects.

Michigan falls to Northwestern on the road, 61-52

ROSEMONT, Ill. — One team 

made shots and the other one 
didn’t.

It’s as simple as a basketball 

game can become. There are 
reasons for why the Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team 
shot 

38.6 percent from the floor and 
Northwestern shot 50 percent 
from deep in the second half.

But the reasons don’t matter. 

It 
doesn’t 
matter 
that 
the 

Wolverines (8-5 Big Ten, 19-7 
overall) didn’t trail Northwestern 
at all in the first 20 minutes of 
Tuesday’s game after getting off 
to an uncharacteristically quick 
start.

What matters is that the 

20th-ranked 
Wolverines’ 

stagnant offense and pitiful free-
throw shooting finally caught up 
to them, as they eventually fell, 
61-52.

“We came out and really 

played well,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “We had a 
good plan. When they adapted 
to our plan, we could not adapt 
very well. We have some habits 
that keep us from getting better, 
and the only thing we can do is 
practice and try to get better.”

The free throws have been the 

least glamorous stat as of late, but 
they weren’t the singular issue 
by any stretch. The Wolverines 
couldn’t 
get 
anything 
going 

against Northwestern’s matchup 
zone defense. That was part of 
the difference in this game as 
opposed to last week’s game 
between the teams.

Back 
then, 
Michigan 

overloaded one side of the court 
and beat the Wildcat defense 
with sheer numbers to pull away 
in the second half.

This time, the shooting never 

woke up. Instead, the Wolverines’ 
mistakes kept coming.

Meanwhile, 
Northwestern 

kept 
applying 
pressure 
and 

making shots, going 4-for-8 from 
beyond the arc. McIntosh got 
whatever he wanted wherever 

he wanted it, finishing with 24 
points.

Michigan, on the other hand, 

crumpled, as Wagner was the 
only Wolverine with anything 
resembling rhythm.

Down eight with just over 

four minutes to go, freshman 
guard Jordan Poole corralled a 
rebound. He looked ahead and 
saw sophomore guard Zavier 
Simpson streak ahead of the 
crowd. Poole attempted a long 
bounce pass, but threw it directly 
off the foot of Northwestern 
forward Scottie Lindsey.

The Wildcats went the other 

way, and McIntosh hit a floater in 
the lane to extend the lead to 10.

“We 
were 
pretty 
good 

(defensively) I think,” Wagner 
said. “I mean, a similar gameplan 
to last time. Obviously it didn’t 
work out as well as we planned 
it, because they made a lot more 
shots, and they found their way 
to the rim a lot better.”

In the first half, things got off 

to a rocky start when freshman 
forward Isaiah Livers turned his 

ankle on an attempted layup and 
couldn’t return to action for the 
rest of the game.

At first it didn’t seem to 

affect Michigan, as it got out 
to a quick start right away. A 
3-pointer from fifth-year senior 
forward 
Duncan 
Robinson 

gave the Wolverines a quick, 
13-3 lead at the under-16 media 
timeout.

Northwestern battled back, 

though. Behind 11 and 10 first-
half points from Lindsey and 
McIntosh, 
respectively, 
the 

Wildcats were within striking 
distance much of the half. They 
trailed by just three at the 
intermission.

That’s 
when 
they 

overwhelmed Michigan.

“They have not shot the ball 

as well this year. Their numbers 
are down,” Beilein said. “… 
They spread you out, and all of 
a sudden, you’re in close outs, 
you’re in close outs, you’re in 
close outs. And so, they started 
the second half by jamming it 
inside, but then, the 3-pointers 

got us the rest of the way.”

Who knows if the Wolverines 

would 
have 
been 
able 
to 

overcome 
Northwestern’s 

shooting 
barrage 
if 
Livers 

hadn’t gotten hurt. It’s entirely 
possible they wouldn’t have.

Still, Wagner cited Livers’ 

energy, defensive effort and 
versatility as things Michigan 
missed, and Beilein mentioned 
that the injury likely made 
things 
tougher 
on 
fifth-

year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson, who had to play 36 
minutes in Livers’ stead.

Either way, the poor shooting 

the Wolverines have recently 
been able to get away with was 
exposed this time. They won’t 
get another opportunity to 
right the ship until they travel 
to Wisconsin on Sunday.

So all that’s left to do now 

is wait, hope a healthy Livers 
can return with the energy his 
teammates value and see if the 
hot shooting that’s been flashed 
in select games this season can 
return. 

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

The Michigan men’s basketball team has played poorly over the past few weeks, especially on offense, an area in which it struggled against Northwestern.

From ugly to uglier

R

OSEMONT, Ill. — The 
message is clear as day for 
the Michigan men’s bas-

ketball team: 
There isn’t 
much to gain 
from beating 
low-tier Big 
Ten teams 
in its final 
stretch of 
regular sea-
son games, 
but there’s a 
hell of a lot to 
lose.

Despite a 19-6 record coming in 

to Monday’s game against North-
western, an NCAA Tournament 
bid is far from a lock. Based on 
their recent press conferences, 
those stakes did not look to be lost 

on coach John Beilein and the 
20th-ranked Wolverines. After 
all, they have eked into the Tour-
nament by the skin of their teeth 
the past two seasons thanks to 
miraculous Big Ten Tournament 
runs and a kind selection com-
mittee.

And yet, as Michigan entered 

Allstate Arena to a crowd that 
was overwhelmingly made up of 
Wolverine fans to face a Wildcats 
team they had limited to just 47 
points eight days prior, you would 
have never known. The nearly 
unwatchable display of basket-
ball that fell in Northwestern’s 
favor, 61-52, was resemblant of a 
Michigan team that seemed on 
the outside looking in. It would 
have perhaps inspired the casual 
observer to turn the TV off and 

read a book. Or socialize with 
others. Or anything else.

The deflated showing began 

early at the 18:23 mark, when 
freshman forward Isaiah Livers 
rolled his ankle on a transition 
layup. His day of contributions 
would be done after two minutes. 
Perhaps as much can be said of 
Michigan.

The first half offered poised, 

but unremarkable basketball. A 
32-29 halftime advantage might 
as well have been a tie. Both 
teams looked lazy and hesitant.

“I don’t think we fastbreaked 

well. I don’t think we got two feet 
in the paint well,” Beilein said. 
“We’ve got a situation where we 
fake a jump shot, the guy jumps 
out of the way and we just pass 
it to somebody else. It’s just hab-
its that we’ve gotta continue to 
change.”

As for the second half, that’s 

when the wheels really came off. 
But when the Wolverines falter, 
they don’t do it with turnovers or 
obvious sloppiness. It’s a sweep-
ing malaise that permeates every 

other facet of their game. They 
shot 5-for-20 the entire half 
including 1-for-10 from 3-point 
land, a byproduct of Northwest-
ern’s zone adjustments and a 
simple inability to hit open looks.

“We’ve gotta shoot the ball bet-

ter,” Beilein said. “We’re not made 
that way. But when we’re shooting 
the ball well we’re pretty good. 
When we shot like we did today, 
it’s not gonna do much good.”

Added junior forward Moritz 

Wagner: “We didn’t do a good job 
of making decisions, (we) missed 
shots that we usually make. … I 
think there were a lot of shots that 
we could’ve made and that we’ve 
made in the past.”

Dare I mention their free 

throw woes, too? Going 13-for-19 
on the night is considered a tre-
mendous improvement after Sat-
urday’s abysmal 12-for-28 output 
against Minnesota.

“It sucks,” Wagner said. “You 

play basketball to make shots. 
It’s fun to win. If you miss free 
throws - I think we missed like 
five free throws in a row, that’s 

not fun. Especially in crunch 
time.”

In multiple instances, even the 

basics were thrown out the win-
dow. In a 2-on-1 fast break down 
eight points, freshman guard Jor-
dan Poole tried to rifle a pass to 
a cutting Zavier Simpson that hit 
Northwestern’s Scottie Lindsey 
square in the leg. Shortly after, 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
nearly turned the 
ball over going up 
the court on an 
errant pass over 
Duncan Robin-
son’s head, saved 
by a timeout.

An anomalic 

performance 
should not neces-
sarily be a cause 
for concern — no 
team in college 
basketball has skirted that fate 
this season. But at this point, it’s 
not an anomaly.

Since its 20-point defeat at 

Nebraska, Michigan’s offense 
has shown that it plays to the 

level of its competition. And with 
the exception of the game at No. 
3 Purdue — where Michigan 
dropped 88 points in a narrow 
loss — that hasn’t been a good sign 
when playing conference cellar-
dwellers.

“It’s getting late in the season, 

a lot of film out there,” Abdur-
Rahkman said. “A lot of teams are 
doing a lot of things and adjusting 

to the way people 
are playing. We 
just gotta make 
adjustments, too.”

The Wolver-

ines have hardly 
impressed in their 
past five games 
to be considered 
locks for the 
tournament, let 
alone the 20th-
best team in the 

nation. Maybe this punch in the 
face will bring them back to the 
reality.

If that’s not the case, then 

the ugly play is only going to get 
uglier.

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

Michigan coach John Beilein thought his team failed to adapt after playing well early in its 61-52 loss.

“It’s getting late 
in the season, 
a lot of film out 

there.”

Wolverines look scared 
against strong defenses

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team is now in a two-
game slump after ending its six-
game win streak last Thursday 
in a matchup against Purdue.

Though 
the 
Boilermakers 

came out strong, the Wolverines 
fired back and held a significant 
lead until Purdue went on a 
16-point run to tie the game. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Kayla 

Robbins had a chance to win the 
game with two free throws, but 
missed both and sent the game 
into overtime.

“The game was not based on 

one play,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Airco told WTKA.“There 
were 
a 
lot 
of 
different 

opportunities throughout the 
course of the game when we 
could’ve gotten one stop or one 
score and the game would’ve 
been different.”

It seems that the downfall of 

the Wolverines was based on 
Purdue’s 
defensive 
pressure. 

The Boilermakers changed the 
defense halfway through the 
game to four guards, playing 
into freshman forward Hailey 
Brown’s weakness.

“So we got kind of settled 

in to what they were doing 
defensively 
and 
then 
they 

switched it,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Once they changed the defense, 
we were never really able to get 
in a rhythm.”

The 
defensive 
aggression, 

even at the beginning, clearly 
threw Michigan for a loop. The 
Wolverines were able to recover 
at halftime, but then lost their 
footing.

“Purdue made a run and we 

really couldn’t stop the run. 
We were in a position to win 
the game a few times down the 
stretch and we weren’t able to 
do that,” Barnes Arico said to 
WTKA. “But it was probably 

the first time all year where we 
looked a little scared and looked 
different prior to any other 
games we had played in this 
year.”

Shortly after the tough loss on 

Thursday, Michigan traveled to 
Rutgers to face another strong 
defensive team.

This 
time, 
the 
Scarlet 

Knights didn’t rely on a mid-
game defensive shift to beat the 
Wolverines, but instead applied 
the pressure early on which 
resulted in 26 turnovers.

“That’s been a theme of 

ours this season and when 
we’re successful we really do 
a great job of taking care of the 
basketball 
and 
Rutgers 
just 

swarmed us,” Barnes Arico 
said to WTKA. “We got rattled 
a little bit, that’s a tough place 
to play. They really do it on 
the defensive end; they’re a 
swarming defensive team. They 
pressured us, and they forced us 
into a lot of turnovers.”

It is clear that the Wolverines 

are afraid to suffer another loss 
and strong defensive teams 
seem to be their weakness. 
The Boilermakers and Scarlet 
Knights used their defensive 
skills to out-maneuver Michigan, 
which led the Wolverines losing 
back-to-back games for the first 
time this season.

“That’s what Purdue and 

Rutgers are both known for 
— is their toughness on the 
defensive end, really physical, 
really scrappy, really in your 
face, 
bumping 
and 
clawing 

and playing aggressive on the 
defensive end,” Barnes Arico 
said to WTKA. “Probably the 
two most defensive programs we 
have in our league.”

The Wolverines will look to 

stop those defensive setbacks 
and bounce back to stop the 
losing 
streak 
on 
Thursday, 

when they face off against 
Northwestern.

Michigan in

Color


Y 

ou 
can’t 
scroll 
through 

your 
news 
feed 
without 

encountering 
the 
latest 

Insider 
video 
highlighting 

some trendy restaurant with some weird 
food. The latest trends fall into several 
categories: lots of cheese, extra desserts, 
colorful combinations and fusion food.

Now that millennials are killing chain 

restaurants, a successful business is all 
about avoiding uniformity, and with 
that has come a wave of ethnic cuisines 
mutilated by whitewashed fusion food.

When done right, combining different 

cultural influences in food can lead 
to fantastic new dishes. Some of the 
best cuisines developed over years of 
mixing cultures in experimental dishes 
(Vietnamese food famously combines 
French and Asian influences).

But I’m not here to talk about culinary 

exploration. I’m here to bitch about a new 
explosion of “trendy” fusion food, which 
all too often whitewashes a beautiful 
cuisine to make it more appealing and cool 
for the hipster crowd.

Leave My Dumplings Alone
Dumplings (or jiaozi) are an honored 

tradition in my house. They are made 
for every special occasion: Chinese New 
Year? Dumplings. Mid-Autumn Festival? 

Dumplings. Birthday? Dumplings. Family 
reunion? Dumplings!

My mother taught me how to make them 

from scratch, which she learned from her 
mother. Dumplings are more than a food 
— they are a bonding activity with cultural 
importance. My Chinese family makes 
fun of my cousin for her lack of dumpling 
making skills, teasing she will never be 
able to find a husband if she can’t make a 
decent dumpling.

Dumplings 
are 
simple, 
delicious 

and carry sentimental and traditional 
importance for my family and culture.

Then white hipsters found them:
Pho Dumplings.
French Onion Soup Dumplings.
Reuben and Pastrami Bao.
Hamburger Dumplings.
Nutella Dumplings.
Each combination more disturbing 

than the last. In some cases, it is a Chinese 
restaurateur creating the food, but the 
market is always hipster millennials for 
whom regular “ethnic food” is so 2005. It’s 
2018 — if your food isn’t one of a kind or 
including avocado, how can you expect to 
draw the right crowd?

Gone is appreciating simple, well-

prepared 
food 
made 
with 
fresh 

ingredients. Gone is my mother’s and 

grandmother’s 
kitchens 
smelling 
of 

noodles and stir-fry. Instead, you take my 
food, put a cheap chocolate spread inside 
and call it revolutionary.

That’s Not A Burrito
Mexican or other Latin American 

cuisine is far from my cultural area of 
expertise. I know that the Chipotle concept 
of a burrito is nowhere near what a real 
burrito is like, and we have taken the idea 
of a burrito and turned it into something 
different entirely.

It started with the breakfast burrito 

and has since evolved into burger burritos, 
cheesy Turkish street food burritos, pho 
burritos, ramen burritos, Korean barbeque 
burritos, orange chicken burritos, chicken 
parmesan burritos, Indian curry burritos 
and, of course, the sushi burrito.

Why are people obsessed with putting 

a perfectly nice dish inside of a tortilla 
and calling it a burrito? Do you want to 
eat with your hands that badly? Did you at 
least wash them first?

None of these things are burritos, and 

you are just ruining good food by eating it 
this way. Why do you want to eat a burrito 
full of noodles? Are you just embarrassed 
because you can’t use chopsticks? Tortillas 
(especially the Americanized wheat-flour 
kind) don’t add much flavor so what are 
you adding to the food by eating it this 
way?

Stop trying to be trendy and just go 

support a local restaurant of your desired 
cuisine run by people actually from that 
region.

Stop Ruining Sushi
While I am not Japanese, I do have a 

deep appreciation of sushi. Outside of 
dumplings, there has been nothing more 
disappointing than watching all the 
variations of sushi, each more elaborate 
and difficult to eat.

It started with the sushi burrito, which 

was my first real experience with this type 
of trendy fusion food. It was the summer 
of 2016 and I was in Philadelphia when 
I encountered a food truck catering the 
sushi burrito that I had seen plastered all 
over my social media. So I tried it.

This triggered my hatred of fusion food.
Sushi, in its purest form, is all about the 

fresh fish on its own or with a simple bed of 
rice. With the sushirrito, I was faced with 
a giant lump of rice, aggressively average 
salmon and some vegetables all shoved in 
soggy seaweed, which was difficult to bite 
through.

Sushi is already bite size — why do you 

have to make it more difficult to eat? It is 
a convenient and delicious meal that fits 
perfectly between your chopsticks and in 
your mouth. 

Since I have seen a wave of new types 

of “sushi:” sushi donuts, cheesy sushi, 
sushi cake, sushi pizza, fried sushi topped 
with potatoes, flaming hot Cheetos sushi 
burrito, just to name a few.

Sushi is a perfect food and does not 

deserve this perversion.

*****
The larger issue here is not just the 

destruction of delicious foods, but the 
connotations they carry.

My sisters and I used to complain when 

my mom sent us Chinese food for school 
lunch, because we wanted to fit in. In 
middle school, I laughed along with my 
friends at the Korean girl eating what 
we called a meat Popsicle. Meanwhile, 
at home, my mom prepared dishes like 
chicken feet or “stinky” tofu.

Then Chinese food became trendy, but 

only if it was prepared in a way geared 
towards affluent white people. The crowd 
at P.F. Chang’s is very different than my 
family’s favorite hole-in-the-wall noodle 
joint. Mapo dofu and hot pot become 
orange chicken and lo mein. How are 
lettuce wraps and miso salmon supposed 
to be Chinese? Foods from minority 
groups are stigmatized as exotic until rich 
hipsters decide they are mainstream.

This Americanized food has now taken 

on a new shape in the fad fusion food 
industry in an attempt to capture the 
younger audience who is bored of chain 
restaurants yet still craves their trendy, 
inauthentic “ethnic” food.

Culinary innovation is a good thing, but 

telling a group that their food is inferior 
for years to pervert its original form into 
something flashy and disgusting does no 
favors to the culinary world.

Critical Questions: Identity Politics

A

re Middle Eastern and 
Northern African people 
Caucasian, 
African 
or 

Asian? Last November, the 

group of students who identify as ME/
NA said no to all three and demanded 
to be recognized as a distinct category 
by the University of Michigan through 
their #WeExist campaign.

It makes sense that ME/NA students 

would want their own identity in 
official records. Though many of 
them have fair skin and their families 
originate from the continents of Asia 
and Africa, their group has different 
needs when compared to whites, Blacks 
and Asians. (I, as a personal opinion, 
would also want to split “Asian” into 
East, Southeast and South, as each of 
those groups’ needs are also wholly 
different).

The 
#WeExist 
campaign 
is 
an 

example of a campaign of identity 
politics, or a brand of politics in 
which 
racial, 
cultural, 
religious, 

socioeconomic or other groups pursue 
their own interests in isolation from 
the rest of the body politic.

The expression “identity politics” 

became the subject of much negative 
attention during the 2016 presidential 
election, and it hasn’t been getting a 
good rep since then.

The left heard of it in regard to 

white 
identity 
politics, 
in 
which 

white Americans—who are finding 
their share of the population and 
influence 
decreasing—voted 
for 
a 

candidate who spoke to their concerns 
while marginalized groups suffered. 
Meanwhile, the right accused Hillary 
Clinton of pandering to voters of 
different racial groups to court votes. 
Even Bernie Sanders, the furthest-
left candidate, later criticized the 
Democrats’ 
emphasis 
on 
identity 

politics.

Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. 

even went on to say in his book, “The 
Disuniting of America”, that focusing 
on our differences more than our 
similarities will result in a “cult of 
ethnicity” that will disintegrate the 
cooperative, compromise-based model 
of the United States’s democracy.

It has been observed since ancient 

times that the democratic process 
goes smoothly if the constituents 
are 
homogeneous. 
Elites 
in 
the 

Athenian and Roman republics had 
a common, unwavering background 
that was not subject to compromise. 
In an increasingly multicultural and 
polarized world, are identity politics 
and democracy compatible?

A 2016 survey of major democracies 

by the United Nation World Happiness 
Report offers a bleak picture. For one, 
the happiest nations in the world are 
“fairly 
homogeneous 
nations 
with 

strong social safety nets” without the 
same kind of racial identity politics 
that exists in the U.S.

However, identity isn’t just about 

race; it encompasses gender, religion, 
ethnicity and a variety of other factors 
that make up a human being. Some of 
my international friends like to tell me, 
“Americans are obsessed with race.” 
But the example of Taiwan shows other 
countries can be just as “obsessed” 
with identity as we are, yet still thrive.

In 
Taiwan’s 
2016 
election, 
the 

Democratic Progressive Party, headed 
by Tsai Ing-wen, won by a landslide. 
Their victory was helped largely by an 
identity shift in Taiwan.

Two months before the election, 

Chou Tzu-yu, a Taiwanese singer in 
the K-pop girl group TWICE, was 
berated by Chinese netizens who were 
offended by her display of a Republic 
of China flag during an appearance 
on a Korean TV show. The other 
members of TWICE showed the flags 
of South Korea and Japan, signaling 
the countries they came from.

The incident resulted in TWICE 

being barred from Chinese television 
and Tzu-yu being forced to pull out of 
an endorsement, causing the president 
of her record company to apologize 
to the Chinese media. Tzu-yu also 
released an apology on the day before 
Taiwan’s elections, affirming there is 
only one China and she is proud to be 
Chinese.

Tzu-yu’s apology was met with 

outrage in Taiwan, and may have 
influenced the election results by 1 to 2 
percent in favor of Tsai, who supports 
Taiwanese independence. Why did this 
happen?

In Taiwan, a majority of citizens 

now identify as solely Taiwanese (as 
opposed to Chinese or a combination of 
the two). Though the People’s Republic 
of China tries to push a narrative of 
eventual reunification, this becomes 
more unrealistic as the identity of the 
island’s people is shifting.

Two years before the elections, 

university students stormed Taiwan’s 
legislature, protesting against what 
they saw as former President Ma Ying-
jeou’s closed-door efforts to rapidly 
integrate the island’s economy with 
that of the mainland.

That identity politics can coexist 

with democracy in Taiwan shows 
its universal nature, for we are all 
embedded in some sort of identity.

However, 
we 
cannot 
just 
stay 

within our identity groups and expect 
everyone to listen to every one of our 
demands, especially if our group is 
smaller and weaker. That is the kind 
of identity politics that was criticized 
during the 2016 elections.

Here is where coalition building 

comes in; when we make temporary 
alliances with other groups to achieve 
a common goal.

Sometimes the alliance is difficult 

to forge, especially if your group and 
another group seem radically different, 
or even outright antagonistic. For 
example, Ta-Nehisi Coates writes that 
rich industrialists prevented the white 
and Black working class from allying 
themselves through the invocation 
of racist attitudes against African 
Americans.

Despite this, psychology experiments 

demonstrate that if group members 
contact each other and find even 
simple commonalities (if both sides 
agreed the roads were bad in their 
municipality, for instance), there is 
more goodwill and trust. University of 
Oxford psychologist Miles Hewstone 
found this to be true with groups as 
separated and distrusting of each 
other as Protestants and Catholics in 
Northern Ireland.

Moreover, though people in our 

identity groups may share a common 
thread, at the same time we are 
composed of multiple identities; this 
is known as intersectionality. I am 
Japanese-American, a straight male, a 
New Jerseyan, an out-of-state student, 
an immigrant and a non-practicing 
Buddhist. Each of these aspects is 

inseparable from my existence.

You cannot talk about economic 

inequality without talking about race 
and gender. You cannot talk about mass 
incarceration without talking about 
Black males and institutional racism. 
You cannot talk about American jobs 
being shipped away without talking 
about middle-class whites. You cannot 
talk about affirmative action without 
talking about being dark-skinned and 
low-income.

Our racial, socioeconomic, sexual, 

cultural and religious identities are 
so intertwined that simply offering 
solutions across the board targeting 
only one of these aspects will not work. 
Simply fixing economic inequality will 
not lead to true equality for minorities, 
as there are more institutional hurdles 
to climb over.

Similarly, not all people in a given 

group are the same. Just because 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
made 

comments 
about 
undocumented 

immigrants does not mean Latinos 
who are here legally will all vote for 
Democrats (in fact, 28 percent of them 
voted for Trump, slightly more support 
than what Mitt Romney received 4 
years earlier).

Contrary to what some pundits 

think, identity politics is a universal 
phenomenon 
and 
the 
U.S. 
just 

expresses it differently from other 
countries as a reflection of its own 
unique racial history. Our democracy 
will not collapse because of identity 
politics; rather, it can survive and 
thrive if we learn to compromise and 
respect each others’ differences.

An oral history of MiC

F

or 
Michigan 
in 
Color’s 

fourth 
anniversary, 
we 

sat down with two of our 
three co-founders — Kayla 

Upadhyaya and Rima Fadhallah — to 
discuss their lives after graduation, the 
challenges they faced and their hopes 
for the future of the section. Reflecting 
on their time at MiC, the two were 
confident in the platform they built. 
However, they were still excited at all 
the new updates since their departures. 
From the “Off the Record” blog to the 
MiC spiritwear to the new MiC desk 
on the left side of the newsroom, the 
section has grown immensely — and so 
have our founders.

Kayla, now a writer in New York 

City, never expected to be heavily 
involved in journalism after leaving 
college. However, after her experience 
with MiC, she was able to translate 
her newfound passions and skills 
into a successful career in media. She 
attributed her extensive preparation for 
the industry to the innovative nature of 
MiC. Currently, she enjoys a career in 
pop culture as a TV critic and reporter 
for Eatery NY.

When we asked Kayla to give some 

advice she had for people of color 
entering journalism, she told us it 
comes down to finding the right 
mentors. She actively sought ones 
who shared a social identity with 
her. As a result, her mentors were 
able to offer specific advice because 
they understood her situation. These 
relationships eventually became so 
strong that Kayla felt she wouldn’t be 

in the position she is in today had she 
not formed and embraced them, so 
they gave her significant first-hand 
experiences in navigating difficulties 
in the workplace.

Rima, on the other hand, participated 

in the Teach for America Program 
after graduating in 2014. Outside of 
work, she also started a blog called 
The Road To. The goal was simple: to 
promote positivity and goal setting. 
The movement started when she used 
the tag #RoadtoOctober to set a goal to 
get healthier by her birthday. Others 
quickly adopted that template, and 
the brand spread. Rima credited this 
success — both in teaching and online — 
to MiC. Her reasoning was because this 
space allowed her to get to know herself 
as a writer and develop her identity as a 
leader in a community of diverse people 
who all wanted a common goal.

We also asked Rima for advice for 

people of color entering education 
(though she is currently applying for 
MBA programs). She told us that as a 
leader, “It’s important to learn how to 
work with people and set aside your 
anger and ego.” For her, she came to 
this realization soon after joining TFA.

When 
she 
started 
teaching 
at 

a 
predominantly 
Black 
school 
in 

Detroit, she saw that the most of her 
fellow teachers hailed from much 
more affluent upbringings than their 
students. As someone who grew up 
in a predominantly Arab school with 
white teachers who also didn’t share 
her life experiences — and therefore 
had trouble relating to her culture and 

identity — Rima quickly realized the 
need for teachers to empathize with 
their students. She felt her impact would 
be felt most if she worked within the 
system and educated her co-workers on 
approaching people of color and cultural 
responsiveness. 
This 
realization 

allowed her to impact her workplace 
because it opened up previously closed 
lines of communication between her, 
her co-workers and the students they 
served.

Before Kayla helped form MiC, she 

was employed by The Daily as an arts 
writer. In this capacity, she was able 
to combine her interest in popular 
culture with her growing passion 
for writing. Though she was able to 
gain valuable experience in the field 
she’d eventually end up working in, 
she recognized that The Daily’s work 
environment was far from perfect. On 
the other hand, Rima and Jerusaliem 
(MiC’s third co-founder) were not 
as involved with the paper before 
forming the section.

Nevertheless, 
Rima 
still 
felt 
a 

similar need to create a more inclusive 
paper. Kayla, who had already been 
writing for The Daily for a few years, 
was focused on how to make existing 
writers of color more comfortable in 
the newsroom. Rima and Jerusaliem, 
however, were more concerned with 
recruiting students of color. After 
realizing that both of these goals could 
be achieved by working together, the 
three went to Andrew Weiner, the 
editor-in-chief in 2013.

This meeting with Andrew proved to 

be the catalyst for the section’s creation. 
MiC started as a simple column on the 
opinion page. They didn’t have a desk 
in the newsroom; they didn’t even 
have a tab on the homepage. At the 
time, that didn’t matter. As second-
semester seniors, their main concern 
was building a strong foundation for 
future editors of the section. However, 
there were still many events on campus 
the section covered.

According to Kayla and Rima, the 

biggest issues MiC covered during her 
time on The Daily was #UMDivest 
and #BBUM. At the time in early 
2014, #BBUM had gained traction the 
preceding November, and the debate 
over divestment began to roil campus. 
Because of this, MiC was able to serve 
as a platform for people to share their 
perspectives on the issue. While before 
MiC was founded, some groups may 
not have felt comfortable voicing their 

opinions in The Daily, Kayla believes 
that 
MiC 
gave 
these 
historically 

underrepresented groups a space on the 
paper to express their opinions. 

While this led to some unexpected 

issues — primarily, the editors were 
criticized for being overly partisan 
in their coverage of the #UMDivest 
movement 
— 
Kayla, 
Rima 
and 

Jerusaliem’s resolve did not waver. In 
Kayla’s words, it’s not MiC’s fault that 
it became political. “People of color 
often face this criticism, but it’s not our 
fault that our entire existence has been 
politicized,” Kayla told us. Additionally, 
Rima told us that the section had trouble 
gaining legitimacy in the newsroom. 
Andrew even believed they wouldn’t be 
able to find enough content. However, 
after getting the green light, the pieces 
started rolling in.

When we asked Kayla and Rima how 

activism in MiC differs from activism in 
other spaces, they had similar answers. 
Kayla told us that, in her mind, there is 
no difference in the types of activism. 
“It’s just a different stage of activism,” 
she said. Though when most people think 
of activism they envision protests on the 
street, that’s only the end stage. Before 
people can take to the streets, they must 
first address the issues from a personal 
point of view. Rima largely agreed, “If 
you look at history, writing has changed 
so much,” she told us. “You have to realize 
that writing in itself is resistance.”

Towards the end of our interview, 

we asked Kayla and Rima what they 
want MiC’s readers to know. Kayla told 
us that she wants them to value the 
diversity within the section and know 
that one piece doesn’t — and couldn’t — 
represent the experiences of all members 
of that group. “It is most beneficial to 
hold people’s multitudes in mind while 
reading submissions,” she told us. “As 
students of color have such a wide range 
of perspectives and experiences that all 
contribute to the vibrancy and dynamic 
of MiC.”

We ended the interview by asking 

for any advice for current and future 
editors. Rima went first: “Block out 
noise as much as you can and always 
think about what’s best for the space.” 
Kayla followed with, “Always think as 
big as possible. So many of the goals 
from our first year were thought to be 
unachievable, but you’ve all been able 
to accomplish so much more than 
thought possible. Don’t limit yourself 
or think this is something that won’t 
happen. Always dream big.”

E

ach year, Michigan in Color 
invites graduating editors to 
write about their experience 

and advice for the incoming cohort. 
In honor of MiC’s fourth birthday, we 
extended the opportunity to all former 
editors to reflect on their time at MiC. 
Here’s what they had to say:

Adam 
Brodnax, 

Business Senior, MiC 
‘17

“Giving 
advice 

to a space I just 
left feels so hard to 
articulate. 
I 
miss 

this space so much 
and after meeting 
Rima just the other 
day, she brought to 
life the beauty of its 

conception and reiterated the necessity 
of its existence. I felt so fired up after 
meeting her and seeing you all — wishing 
I was still here celebrating in the joy of 
our writers and being present to parse 
their pain. I felt the power of this space 
as a contributor with its ability to heal 
and build resilience. And I felt the 
weight of this space as an editor with 
the responsibility we have to this space.

Michigan in Color was a space where I 

figured myself out. It was a space where 
I could unwrap — to let my insecurities 
and internalized hate fall away. In just 
my short time with this space, I’ve felt 
the depth of emotions with my fellow 
editors. From protecting our space with 
all our might to being on the offense 
when our contributors were shown hate, 
we’ve fought for each other through our 
love for this space. The advice I would 
leave you as MiC grows is that as it 
thrives, blossoms and sprouts, don’t 
forget to tend to the soil. Venture into 
the possibilities, but don’t forget that 
this space was built on a revolutionary 
act. Storytelling is a liberating act of 
resistance. To give power, agency to 
People of Color is a revolutionary act.

To, Jason, Ashley, Christian, Halimat 

and the new cohort — I know that you 
all will carry this space forward with 
grace and continue to fight for justice. 
I am blessed to have contributed to this 
space, and I am so grateful for what you 

all do.”

“Anyone 
who 

knows 
me 
today 

knows 
I 
have 

trouble 
holding 

my tongue when it 
comes 
to 
politics. 

I’m politically charged, to say the 
least, and I’m not afraid to show it. 
Growing up, however, I hated politics. 
Despite my love of reading, writing 
and history, I slugged through the 
required government classes in high 
school, avoiding the AP options at all 
costs. It wasn’t until my senior year of 
high school, during President Obama’s 
re-election campaign that I took a leap 
of faith and willingly enrolled in a 
political science class. That campaign, 
for me, became distinctly about the 
people behind the policies (and the 
“binders full of women;” #tbt to GOP 
shame of the past). Like a match, my 
passion for politics was ignited, I was 
sucked in by the presidential debates 
and the discussions that followed 
among my classmates. 

The following year, as a bright-

eyed freshman who has always had a 
secret dream of being an investigative 
journalist, I joined The Michigan Daily 
as a Copy Editor, too scared to trust my 
own voice as a writer. Week after week, 
I was tasked with fact checking news 
and opinion stories; I was intrigued by 
the political stories and used them as an 
opportunity to learn more about local 
government and the facts thrown around 
during the popular political debates. 
I enjoyed contributing, even ever so 
slightly, to these political conversations. 
But I became eerily comfortable with 
the format of hiding opinions behind 
numbers and charts. And while cold 
hard calculated facts tell one side of a 
story, rich and important narratives are 
lost among these generalizations. 

I distinctly remember the first time 

a Michigan in Color story was sent to 
the Copy desk, I had read a few of their 
stories before, and as the only person of 
color at the desk that evening (and one 
of very few on the entire staff), I jumped 
on the opportunity to edit the story. It 
wasn’t the story itself that stuck with 
me, but the way it engaged and evoked 
a deeper understanding of the issues it 
raised. It was the harmonious marriage 
of narrative and political discourse I 
never knew I was looking for. I knew 
I had to join this incredibly passionate 
and inspiring group of people.

My passion for law and policy was 

born out of a commitment to humanize 
political discourse — to unearth the 
stories that have been silenced by years 
of denying the rights and humanity of 
minorities in this country and abroad. 
Michigan in Color fills an important 
void that extends beyond the Michigan 
campus; it brings to light the lived 
experiences behind the often empty 
political discussions that have become 

increasingly 
important 
in 
today’s 

climate. MiC plays an integral role in 
reversing the whitewashing of history 
— and more importantly, herstory.

To the current and future generations 

of MiC editors, writers and readers, I urge 
you to take ownership of this platform 
— don’t be afraid to engage and to share. 
As a Zoroastrian Pakistani-American, 
I’ve always been more comfortable 
starting the deep discussions rather 
than contributing to them, and this 
was a role I truly enjoyed having as a 
MiC editor. My own confusion with my 
identity and narrative is something I’m 
still trying to work out. My favorite part 
of being an editor was helping writers 
take even the most barebones of ideas 
and helping them craft their story. MiC 
is a community where deeply complex 
identities and narratives have always 
been welcome, where people of color 
are allowed to be more than the limited 
representations of us that currently 
exist. I encourage you to be bolder 
than I was, to find your voice in this 
community and unapologetically share 
your story. This platform is and always 
will be here to amplify your voices.”

“I joined Michigan 

in Color in a bit 
of 
an 
unorthodox 

way. 
I 
wandered 

in 
from 
another 

section of The Daily 
in the middle of the 
academic year, really 
unsure of what was 
next for me as a 
writer, or what my 
next big thing would 

be. I was met with an amazing group of 
people, Sabrina, Toni, Demario, Ashley 
and Christian, who welcomed me with 
open arms as one of their own and 
helped me find a new sense of direction 
and purpose for myself as a writer and 
activist.

My one semester as a senior editor 

for MiC was well spent. We hosted an 
amazing open mic event where I was 
able to meet and connect with many 
wonderful storytellers of color on 
campus, some of whom I’m still close 
with today. It was a blessing not only 
to support communities of color to 
share their truths, but also to have the 
chance to share my own. Michigan in 
Color challenged me and taught me to 
be brave and unapologetic, and I haven’t 
been the same since.

My cohort of MiC editors also had the 

amazing opportunity to interview the 

Rev. Jesse Jackson. The reverend drew 
on his more than 50 years of experience 
in civil rights activism to share with us 
his insights on the state of our current 
socio-political climate following the 
latest presidential election. His words 
reminded us of the urgent need for us to 
work together to shift the tide of racial 
political climate more toward justice, 
but also reassured us that we, students 
of color, had all we needed to carry on 
in our fight for true hope and equity. 
I’m filled with gladness to have had the 
chance to share that deeply profound 
and spiritual experience with my MiC 
family when we needed it the most.

My time in MIC was short, but I will 

forever be grateful for the opportunity 
to serve the students of color at the 
University of Michigan and work with 
such talented, dynamic, people. To the 
new MiC team, you have the privilege 
to be a part of a movement that is so 
special and will undoubtedly leave a 
legacy at the University and beyond. 
Cherish this time, it really flies by! Use 
this time to branch out, connect with 
other communities on campus and learn 
empathy, but also use this time to learn 
to appreciate and develop the amazing 
skills and talents you bring to the table 
toward activism and advancing justice. 
I’m so proud of the growth and success 
MiC has achieved over the past several 
months and am so excited to see what it 
will achieve in the future.

In solidarity, always and forever!”

Dear future Michigan in Color editors

T

he Michigan in Color of today 
is not the same as the one of 
yesterday, or even the one 
of tomorrow. From radical 

column to bona fide Daily section, MiC 
continues to grow to meet the needs of 
communities of color across campus. 
Along with sharing the narratives of the 
lives of students of color, we are expand-
ing to focus on lighter content with com-
mentary on pop culture and a new blog 
and podcast. In honor of MiC’s four-year 
anniversary, we wanted to pay tribute 
to the amazing women who founded this 
space, the editors who helped us grow and 
the future we have left to create.

Written in 2014
D

ear Future Michigan in 
Color Editors,

We are so excited to 

welcome you to the MiC 

family. We know that you are going to 
have an amazing time with this magi-
cal space, and we have no doubt that you 
will be overwhelmed with the amount 
of love, affirmation and knowledge that 
you will gain from your experience. 
Before you start serving those who will 
interact with our space, we want the 
opportunity to first serve you by telling 
you MiC’s story…

We created MiC because we believe 

wholeheartedly in the power narrative 
has to facilitate social change, so we feel 
it is appropriate and necessary to include 
the MiC (hi)story in this constitution: 

Rima: The week before my senior year 

began I was at my apartment on Thomp-
son street talking to my mom on the 
phone. My mom is an avid novel reader, 
and she was telling me about how eth-
nocentric the novels she reads are and 
how she would love for someone to start 
a publication that was devoted to publi-
cizing the narratives of people of color 
to make readers aware of the multi-
tude of experiences that fall under this 
umbrella. She said: “Take us for exam-
ple. Someone could write a book about 
being an Arab American from Dearborn 
and just walk us through their every-day 
lives. It doesn’t even have to be heavy! It 
could simply be about the food the char-
acter eats, or the way she interacts with 
her family. My point is, I’ve been read-
ing the same perspective and I just want 
something different! People should be 

aware of other experiences and people 
of color should be the ones writing about 
their own lives.”

This idea, that the dominant nar-

rative excludes and silences people of 
color’s voices, should sound very famil-
iar because it is the premise of Michigan 
in Color. Its truth was the reason we 
approached the Daily with our vision 
for the column. But MiC didn’t come 
with the snap of our fingers, and as your 
founding editors, we want you to keep 
MiC’s history in mind as you invest in its 
future.
R

ima: I grew up in Dear-
born, Michigan — home to 
the largest concentration 
of Arabs in one city outside 

of the Middle East. Ironically, I didn’t 
realize how “Arab” I was until I came 
to Michigan, a school that is 72 percent 
white. I spent my first three years trying 
to understand why I felt uncomfortable, 
and realized really early on that I wasn’t 
alone in feeling this way, that most peo-
ple of color do not feel represented or 
welcome on Michigan’s campus. Plac-
es like the Michigan Daily, a publica-
tion even whiter than U of M, made me 
especially uncomfortable, but I really 
believed in the necessity of a column 
where people of color could share their 
stories. I felt that my campus’s publica-

tion should make room for a space like 
this if it was going to claim to be rep-
resentative of all students on campus. 
I first approached the Daily expressing 
interest in one of their columnist posi-
tions because I love to share my opin-
ions (who knew?) and I felt the position 
could help me make connections within 
the Daily. 

I e-mailed the Daily a few times over 

the summer about the application and 
received no response. When I got to 
campus early that Fall, I approached a 
[white] Daily staffer about the oppor-
tunity and he responded pretty conde-
scendingly: “We’re no longer accepting 
applications for that position and, no 
offense, but we usually only offer those 
positions to really important people. 
Like students who are really heavily 
involved on campus. You can still join 
edit-board though if you’re interested 
in writing for Opinion.” I was extremely 
confused by this man’s response con-
sidering he didn’t even know my name, 
but I thanked him anyway and decided 
I would join edit-board because it was 
the only way I could be involved with 
the Daily and possibly forge relation-
ships with people who might believe in 
my vision.

After the first few edit-board meet-

ings, I realized that biting my tongue 

was something I would have to get used 
to doing while in the student publication 
building. After all, that’s what the other 
two POCs in the room did — even when 
[white] people on edit-board said crazy 
things like: “Race isn’t a thing — it’s a 
social construct. Because it’s not biologi-
cally a thing, I’m not going to treat it like 
it’s a thing,” or “Detroit is useless. We 
should just burn the whole city down,” 
or “What the hell is the point of diversity 
education and why do we talk so much 
about it? There’s no point in educating 
people about diversity,” and lastly, “Why 
do we keep blaming Israel for every-
thing! There are horrible things going 
on everywhere in the world - why do 
we keep picking on Israel!? (*cries and 
shoves gummy bears in her mouth*)” 
It made me sick to my stomach to hear 
the “leaders and best” saying such igno-
rant, silencing and offensive things. If I 
wasn’t already convinced walking into 
the Publication Building, my few weeks 
with edit-board furthered my convic-
tion in starting our column. I couldn’t 
keep my mouth shut for long though.
O

ne day, a staffer sent out an 
e-mail to the entire Daily 
staff likening an annual 
Michigan 
Daily 
football 

match to, in his careless words, a “Shi-
ite vs. Sunni rivalry.” At this point, I was 
tired of having to bite my tongue when 
it didn’t seem anyone else around me 
felt accountable for theirs. I emailed 
then Editor in Chief, Andrew Weiner, 
because I got a pleasant and friendly 
vibe from him; still, I didn’t expect 
much, but I hoped he would be respon-
sive to my concerns at the very least. 
Sure enough, Andrew set up a meeting 
with me and included Zeinab Khalil — 
a fierce Daily columnist who was also 
extremely triggered by the malicious 
email — and the [white] asshole (we’ll 
refer to him as WA) who wrote the 
email.

The only thing that came out of that 

meeting was Zeinab and I realizing 
more and more how silencing white 
privilege can be, and Andrew recogniz-
ing that the Daily may have a serious 
problem with diversity and inclusion. 
WA refused to apologize even after 
Andrew asked him to several times. 
Instead, he raised his voice to try to 
intimidate Zeinab and I because he was 
very uncomfortable with two women 
of color putting him on the defensive. 
By the end of the meeting, Andrew still

annual Michigan Daily football match

could not get WA to apologize and had 
to, instead, apologize profusely on WA’s 
behalf. Andrew told Zeinab and I that 
he wanted to meet with us again in the 
coming weeks to discuss ways to make 
the Daily more inclusive to and repre-
sentative of people of color on campus. 

Shortly 
after 
this 
incident, 
I 

approached Zeinab Khalil with her idea 
for the column and she helped me refine 
my ideas and come up with a more solid 
vision for the column. I always admired 
Zeinab’s critical mind and devotion to 
social justice — her belief in the vision 
made me so much more confident talk-
ing to other friends and using their feed-
back to create a more holistic plan for 
the column. Zeinab and I agreed that we 
would present our notes to Andrew dur-
ing our follow up meeting with him. 

Andrew was extremely receptive and 

willing to implement pretty much any-
thing we asked for. He told Zeinab and I 
that he would love for us to co-found the 
space. Zeinab politely declined the offer 
because she was busy founding the kick-
ass Michigan Women of Color Collective 
(MWOCC), an organization that signifi-
cantly transformed the face of student 
activism within communities of color 
during our senior year and is a huge rea-
son why MiC is so successful today. 

During this conversation, Andrew 

introduced me to Kayla, a senior and 
another woman of color, who had been 
writing for the Daily since her fresh-
man year. I remember hearing Kayla 
speak at one of the Daily mass meetings, 
and I always admired her boss status 
from afar. She edited the Arts section 
of the Daily and had been working for 
the Daily for three years. Andrew said 
that she heard about the column idea 
and was very interested in co-founding 
the column with me. Kayla then got in 
touch with Jerusaliem, another talented 
woman of color whom she felt would be 
perfect for the third editing position. 
Jerusaliem, Kayla, Zeinab and I col-
laborated on a Google Doc titled “POC 
Space in the Daily” and “Name/Mission 
Statement” that we have saved for you in 
your “History and Constitution” folder. 
These documents were basically the 
building blocks for what is now Michi-
gan in Color and could probably help you 
understand better the raw thoughts we 
had before MiC became the monster it is 
today.

Shortly after Zeinab helped Kayla, 

Jerus and I finalize our Mission State-
ment, Vision and name. For the first 
time, Kayla, Jerus and I met up at State 
street’s Espresso Royale as the MiC Edi-
torial Team (still strangers) to write the 
first ever MiC Drop (that we decided 
we would publish, not coincidentally, 
on Martin Luther King Jr’s birthday). 
Before we published it though, Jerus and 
I attended MLK Symposium events and 
started spreading the word about Michi-
gan in Color and encouraging people to 

apply to contribute. We individually and 
collectively reached out to our friends 
within the Daily, in various student orgs 
and even on other campuses to spread 
the word. We attended meetings to get 
people to sign up and obviously, we 
Facebooked and Tweeted our asses off. 
All that was great, and while we’re sure 
it helped spread the word about what we 
were doing, we want you to understand 
how important personal relationships 
were in making MiC happen.
Z

einab’s Women of Color Col-
lective was an organization 
that united over 200 amaz-
ing women of color from all 

walks of life. At any given meeting, there 
were at least 30 women ready to share 
their hearts and speak their truths. In 

MWOCC’s Facebook group, women of 
color can post to an audience of 240 
other WOC who are ready to listen and 
respond with love, support and affirma-
tion. Because of the relationships that 
came out of this wonderful collective, 
student groups of color were able to 
forge personal, social and political rela-
tions for the first time in our four years 
at the U. Prior to our senior year, we had 
all belonged to different communities 
of color who dealt with issues indepen-
dently, rarely receiving support or offer-
ing a lending hand to other communities 
of color on campus dealing with similar 

issues. 

Because of MWOCC, real relation-

ships happened across these lines of dif-
ference, and because of the genuine love 
that transcended these imaginary walls, 
real activism and coalition building 
happened. Without MWOCC, momen-
tous movements like the Black Student 
Union’s #BBUM (Being Black at Michi-
gan), and Students Allied for Freedom 
and Equality’s #UMDivest campaign/
sit in — two student-led movements that 
gained national attention that year — 
would not have been able to garner as 
much genuine support and allyhood as 
they did. Largely because of the rela-
tionships we built in MWOCC, your 
founding editors were able to attract 
contributors and a solid reader base who 
trusted and believed in us. MWOCC 
helped us form real relationships with 
women who would ride and die for us 
and our movement. It helped Jerus, 
Kayla and I understand one another as 
more than just co-editors — by the end of 
the year, we became life-long sisters in 
a movement larger than we could imag-
ine. Our time together as MiC editors — 
though far too short — has changed each 
of our lives forever. 

We can’t stress enough how impor-

tant keeping the trust and genuine rela-
tionships will be in the years to come. 
Because MiC has developed a name 
for itself, it is unlikely you will have to 
worry about outreach (after the first few 
weeks, we were overwhelmed with the 
amount of submissions we were getting). 
But that’s not our point.
Y

es, you are editors and man-
agers of this column, but 
what you are working with 
is so much more important 

than marketing and statistics. MiC was 
attractive because there was a need for 
a platform that amplified the voices of 
people of color, but it was 
successful 

because people knew, loved and trust-
ed someone involved with Michigan 
in Color. While keeping this trust will 
undoubtedly look different than gaining 
it, it will require from each of you just as 
much reflection, humility and love as it 
did from us.

And trust us, you will receive it in 

return. The amount of support, affir-
mation and love that we got from 
those interacting with this space got 
us through our toughest days. You will 
receive random e-mails from people 
across the nation telling you that they 
appreciate your work. You will be show-
ered with compliments in Tweets and 
Facebook posts. You will have allies who 
defend your work every time someone 
posts a stupid and ignorant Facebook 
comment under an article. You will run 
into people on campus who remind you 
how much they love you for the work you 
are doing. And you will be worthy of all 
of it because you are amazing, brave and 
dedicated to this movement. You are the 

facilitators of a discourse that needs to 
be happening in our nation. You are the 
enablers of voices and narratives who 
have been silenced, discouraged, mar-
ginalized and oppressed for far too long. 
 

You will be playing defense and 

offense at the same damn time. You will 
be defending this space from anything 
that tries to harm it (we wouldn’t be sur-
prised if, as it gains more traction, the 
“no whites allowed” element becomes 
more controversial). You need to truly 
believe in our MiC Drops and embody 
MiC’s Purpose and Vision because you 
will need to defend them time and time 
again if you haven’t had to already. You 
will be playing offense because you will 
have to constantly ask what communities 
of color on campus need and want out of 
MiC and then ask yourselves whether 
MiC is fulfilling this need. A huge part 
of your job is to continue to develop this 
space so it is all that it can be for POCs at 
or affiliated with Michigan.

And the job description ain’t the half 

of it. You will each be a full-time poster 
child for this space, whether you like it 
or not. This reality is why you should be 
able to defend anything and everything 
you do as editors, students, activists and 
young adults. There will be times when 
your activism — both in and outside of 
MiC — will come under attack (in our 
experience, especially if you are pro-
Palestinian). You need to support one 
another during these times but contin-
ue to be brave and unapologetic about 
the work that you do because it’s not 
about you. It is so important to embody 
MiC’s vision and purpose in all that you 
do, because your undying belief in this 
movement is the reason spaces like these 
are visible, replicable and powerful. In 
these moments of controversy, consis-
tency and conviction is key. You need 
to think about the bigger picture at all 
times: could the backlash, criticism and 
verbal violence from white peers be 
exactly why a space like MiC needs to 
exist for us? If communities of color are 
upset or unsatisfied, what could we be 
doing better to ensure they feel welcome 
and represented in a space created for 
them? 

Our intention is not to scare you (and 

we know you’re too badass and commit-
ted to be scared anyway), but we want 
you to know that the worst thing you can 
do for yourselves, for others and for MiC 
is to undermine the power and impor-
tance of this work. As you change lives 
this year, don’t let modesty get in the 
way of recognizing and celebrating the 
revolution you are leading, but be hum-
ble enough to learn from those around 
you every step of the way.
W

ith much love and respect,

I felt that 

my campus’ 
publication 
should make 
room for a 

space like this 
if it was going 
to claim to be 
representative 
of all students 
on campus.

showcasing the journey of a 
young girl trying to find her 
truth about her Vietnamese 

culture. With 10 different dances, 

the entirely student-run show 
features over 120 student and 

guest performers.
