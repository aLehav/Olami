Sustainability
research funding.
doubled, carbon
emissions down
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily StaffReporter
The University is on track to
become a lot greener.
According to a newly released
report, the University has
doubled its funding of sustain-
ability research since 2003 and
has made significant progress
toward its 2025 long-term goals
- known as "Planet Blue" - of
advancing education, research
and efforts to make the Univer-
sity itself more sustainable.
In a press release, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
said environmental sustainabili-
ty is very important to the school.
"We understand our legacy as
a leader in reviving Michigan's
Great Lakes and forests, integrat-
ing environment and business in

our curriculum and protecting
vital systems throughout the
world," Coleman said.
Coleman laid out the Univer-
sity's long-term sustainability
goals ina major address in 2011.
On an operations level, the
report stated that the University
has made strides in decreasing
carbon emissions from its vehicle
fleet, purchasing more sustain-
able foods and participating in
greener landscaping practices.
Nonetheless, Andrew Berki,
manager of the University's
Office of Campus Sustainability,
said keeping operations sustain-
able will be difficult considering
the fact that the University will
continue grow at a rate of1 to 2
percent per year..
"With growth and an increase
in growth of research activities,
we'll see a higher demand on
utilities and energy use," Berki
said. "I think that will provide us
a challenge going forward."
Efforts to remain sustainable
despite growth could include
projects in energy conservation,

Hopwood Awards
recognize talented
students
By DANIELLE WALLICK
For the Daily
Following the likes of Pulit-
zer Prize winner and University
and Daily alum Arthur Miller,23
students received Hopwood and
other writing contest awards

in the Rackham Auditorium on
Tuesday afternoon.
The Hopwood Under-
classmen Awards Ceremony
announced and honored the
undergraduate winners of the
writing contests administered
by the LSA Hopwood Awards
Program in the fall term.,Hop-
wood categories include fiction,
non-fiction and poetry.
The awards are made possible
each year by Avery Hopwood, an
American dramatist who gradu-

ated from the University in 1905.
He left one-fifth of his estate to
the University with the stipula-
tion that it be used to encourage
creative writing by students.
This year, $11,900 was award-
ed, with prizes ranging from
$100 to $3,000. Another con-
test administered by the Hop-
wood Program in April awards
$16,100 in prizes.
Other awards included four
poetry prizes, as well as the
Roy and Helen Meador Writing

Award and the Roy W. Cowden
Memorial Fellowship, given
each year to undergraduate stu-
dents based on financial need
and writing talent.
The first Hopwood awards
were presented in 1931. Since
then, more than 32,000 student
writers have received a cumula-
tive total of more than $3.4 mil-
lion in prizes. The awards were
presented by the director of the
Hopwood Awards Program,

BUSINESS
. New sites help-
students find
* subject tutors

ON DISPLAY

Companies offer
support to students,
marketing to tutors
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
Wouldn't it be nice to get
a tricky homework question
answered in the middle of the
night or find a tutor who your
friends have already used and
recommend? Two new compa-
nies targeting students - one
started by a University student -
are working to do just that.
LSA sophomore Ryan Gott-
fried is ;helping students find
tutors with his new website,
TutorScoop. TutorScoop is an
academic social networking site
that connects students at the
University with tutors who are
trained in a range of subjects.
Gottfried launched the web-
site in beta form on Jan. 17, but
developed it for about a year
prior to its release.
TutorScoop aims to simplify
the process for students to find
tutors. There are currently more
than 75 tutors and 300 students

signed up, and these numbers
continue to rise, Gottfried said.
"Thousands of UM students
seek out tutors each year, and
TutorScoop is here to finally
make that process easier," Gott-
fried said.
The site not only enables
tutors to find students online,
but it also gives them the ability
to build up their businesses and
brand themselves. Bookings and
payments are both done online.
TutorScoop empowers its stu-
dent base by allowing customers
to review their tutors and give
recommendations to their peers.
A student who finds a tutor with
good reviews and a schedule
that suits his or hers can book an
appointment instantly.
"We are quite literally a ser-
vice for students, by students,"
Gottfried said.'
Gottfried hopes to expand his
program to other colleges in the
fall and eventually add a video
chat feature. A rewards program
is also in the works. The hope is
that students who are very active
on TutorScoop can also earn
benefits from local businesses.

ANTI-GAY VANDALIZATION AT BOSTON CO L[ LAW SCHOOL
GLBTQ office defaced

BORDER PATROL

The Boston College Law
School's GLBTQ office was van-
dalized after the long Martin
Luther King Jr. Day weekend
ewith homophobic slurs and
derogative terms like "frig,"
"gay bukkake," and "bean
flicker," The Heights reported
Thursday.
The incident was reported
to BC Law Dean Vincent D.
Rougeau and the Newtown
"Police Department who are cur-
rently conducting an investiga-
tion, The Heights added.
Rougeau released a letter rep-
rimanding those responsible.
"The administration of Bos-
ton College Law School con-
demns this reprehensible action

and will not tolerate hateful or
threateningspeech of any kind,"
the letter said.
"This behavior is the antith-
esis of all we stand for as an
institution, and is an assault on
our shared values of a welcom-
ing, loving and inclusive com-
munity."
UNC responds to sexual .
assault complaint
University of North Carolina
administrators answered alle-
gations on Thursday against the
university's management of sex-
ual assault cases from earlier in
the month, The Daily Tar Heel
Monday.

The complaint was co-
authored by Melinda Manning,
former assistant dean of stu-
dents, who claimed UNC pres-
sured her to under-report cases
of sexual assault on campus.
Falsely recording crime statis-
tics at a federally funded uni-
versity formed the basis of the
complaint.,
Leslie Strohm, vice chancel-
lor and general counsel, said
the allegations were completely
false and responded strongly to
them.
"The allegations, with respect
to the under-reporting of sexual
assault, are false," Strohm said.

Public gathering ban Obama backs Senate
abolished in Myanmar immigration plan

Decades-old ban
abolished under
more liberal regime
YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -
Myanmar's nearly 2-year-old
reformist government has abol-
ished a ban on public gather-
ings of more than five people
that was ordered in 1988 on the
day a military junta took power
after crushing nationwide pro-
democracy protests.
The state-run Myanma Ahlin
newspaper reported Tuesday
that Order No 2/88 was abol-
ished as it was not in line with a
section of the constitution that
says existing laws should remain
valid as long as are not contrary
to the constitution, which guar-
antees basic rights such as free-
dom of expression.
The order had been applied

selectively to crush dissent
against the military regimes that
held power until the elected gov-
ernment of President Thein Sein
took office in 2011. His admin-
istration has instituted political
liberalization, including lifting
strict censorship.
The order had declared "Gath-
ering or marching in processions
and delivering speeches on the
streets by a group.of 5 or more
people are banned." The junta
used many catch-all or vaguely
defined orders and laws as a
means of suppressing dissent,
and courts generally handed out
stiff sentences, jailing thousands
of political prisoners. Most have
been freed under amnesties pro-
mulgated by President Thein
Sein.
In December 2011, a "Peaceful
Assembly Law" was implemented
specifically allowing public pro-
tests. However, permission must
be obtained in advance, without

H,-,,OK

which organizers are subject to
penalties including prison terms.
Several people have been arrest-
ed under the statute.
Exercise of the new-won free-
doms has tested the patience of
the authorities. Last year, sensa-
tionalistic photos and stories in
the media threatened to exacer-
bate already deep tensions trig-
gered by violent clashes between
two separate ethnic communi-
ties in western Myanmar.
A defense ministry statement
published in state media Tues-
day blamed unspecified embas-
sies, organizations and media of
releasing news and announce-
ments that could cause misun-
derstanding of the military and
the government in connection
with fighting against guerrillas
of the Kachinethnic minority in
the north.
The statement carried in the
Myanma Ahlin daily said the
embassies and media had made
one-sided reports of the army's
activities that failed to mention
destructive acts carried out by
the Kachin Independence Army,
and its attacks on government
convoys carrying food supplies
to bases.
It said the army was carrying
out its duty to ensure the people's
safety and smooth and secure
transportation, and "has inevita-
bly launched military operations
in self-defense." It added that the
military reiterated its commit-
ment to fostering eternal peace
and national unity with ethnic
minorities including the Kachin.
The statement did not men-
tion any specific organization,
but the foreign ministry last
week issued a statement reject-
ing a U.S. embassy statement of
concern over government mili-
tary activities.
The same issue of the newspa-
per reported that two villagers
were injured when their motor-
cycle hit a land mine planted by
the Kachin, and stated that the
guerrillas had burned down a
jade company building in sante
area.

Pres. says 'now is
the time' to tackle
long-standing issue
LAS VEGAS (AP) - Declar-
ing "now is the time" to fix
the nation's broken immigra-
tion system, President Barack
Obama on Tuesday outlined
broad proposals for putting mil-
lions of illegal immigrants on a
clear path to citizenship while
cracking down on businesses
that employ people illegally
and tightening security at the
borders. He hailed a bipartisan
Senate group on a similar track
but left unresolved key details
that could derail the complex
and emotional effort.'
Potential Senate roadblocks
center on how to structure
the avenue to citizenship and
on whether legislation would
cover same-sex couples. - and
that's all before a Senate mea-
sure could be debated, approved
and sent to the Republican-con-
trolled House where opposition
is sure to be stronger.
Obama, who carried Nevada
in the November election
with heavy Hispanic support,
praised the Senate push, saying
Congress is showing "a genuine
desire to get this done soon."
But mindful of previous immi-
grations efforts that have failed,
he warned that the debate
would be difficult and vowed
to send his own legislation to
Capitol Hill if lawmakers don't
act quickly.
"The question now is sim-
ple," Obama said during a cam-
paign-style event in Las Vegas,
one week after being sworn in
for a second term in the White
House. "Do we have the resolve
as a people, as a country, as a
government to finally put this
issue behind us? I believe that
we do."
Shortly after Obama fin-
ished speaking, cracks emerged
between the White House and
the group of eight senators,

which put out their proposals
one day ahead of the president.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a
potential 2016 presidential can-
didate, faulted Obama for not
making a citizenship pathway
contingent on tighter border
security, a central tenet of the
lawmakers' proposals.
"The president's speech left
the impression that he believes
reforming immigration quickly
is more important than reform-
ing immigration right," Rubio
said ina statement.
House Speaker John Boehner
also responded coolly, with
spokesman Brendan Buck say-
ing the Ohio Republican hoped
the president would be "careful
not to drag the debate to the left
and ultimately disrupt the dif-
ficult work that is ahead in the
House and Senate."
Despite possible obstacles
to come, the broad agreement
between the White House and
bipartisan lawmakers in the
Senate represents a drastic shift
in Washington's willingness
to tackle immigration, an issue
that has languished for years.
Much of that shift is politically
motivated, due to the growing
influence of Hispanics in presi-
dential and other elections and
their overwhelming support for
Obama in November.
The separate White House
and Senate proposals focus on
the same principles: providing
a way for most of the estimated
11 million people already in the
U.S. illegally to become citizens,
strengthening border security,
cracking down on employers
who hire illegal immigrants and
streamlining the legal immigra-
tion system.
A consensus around the
question of citizenship could
help lawmakers clear one major
hurdle that has blocked previ-
ous immigration efforts. Many
Republicans have opposed
allowing illegal immigrants to
become citizens, saying that
would be an unfair reward for
people who have broken the law.

Details on how to achieve
a pathway to citizenship still
could prove to be a major stick-
ing point between the White
House and the Senate group.
Obama and the Senate law-
makers all want to require peo-
ple here illegallyto register with
the government, pass criminal
and national security back-
ground checks, pay fees and
penalties as well as back taxes
and wait until existing immigra-
tion backlogs are cleared before
getting in line for green cards.
Neither proposal backs up those
requirements with specifics.
After achieving legal status,
U.S. law says people can become
citizens after five years.
The Senate proposal says
that entire process couldn't
start until the borders were
fully secure and tracking of
people in the U.S. on visas had
improved. Those vague require-
ments would almost certainly
make the timeline for achieving
citizenship longer than what the
White House is proposing.
The president urged lawmak-
ers to avoid making the citizen-
ship pathway so difficult that it
would appear out of reach for
many illegal immigrants.
"We all agree that these men
and women have to earn their
way to citizenship," he said.
"But for comprehensive immi-
gration reform to work, it must
make clear from the outset that
there is a pathway to citizen-
ship."
"It won't be a quick process,
but it will be a fair process,"
Obama added.
Another key difference
between the White House and
Senate proposals is the adminis-
tration's plan to allow same-sex
partners to seek visas under the
same rules that govern other
family immigration. The Sen-
ate principles do not recognize
same-sex partners, though
Democratic lawmakers have
told gay rights groups that they
could seek to include that in a
the final bill.

Senate committee
aproves blue cross
legistation
A legislative committee has
approved bills, to overhaul Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Michigan
that don't include abortion pro-
visions that led Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder to veto the measure
in December.
Legislation passed quickly on
Tuesday would transform the
state's largest health insurer
from a charitable trust into a
customer-owned nonprofit. The
bills aren't expected to run into
much resistance in the Republi-
can-led Senate.
Less clear is how they'll fare
in the GOP-controlled House,
where newly elected members
know less about the issue.
Snyder opposed the last-min-

who like going out in the buff.
U.S. District Court Judge
Edward Chen refused to block
the ban temporarily or to allow a

"In spite of what plaintiffs

BP investigation
closed by Justice
Department
BP PLC closed the book on
the Justice Department's crimi-
nal probe of its role in the Deep-
water Horizon disaster and Gulf
oil spill Tuesday, when a federal
* judge agreed to let the London-
based oil giant plead guilty to
manslaughter charges for the
deaths of 11 rig workers and pay a
record $4 billion in penalties.
What the plea deal approved
by U.S. District Judge Sarah
Vance doesn't resolve, though,
is the federal government's civil
claims against BP. The company
could pay billions more for envi-
ronmental damage from its 2010
spill.
Vance noted that the compa-
ny already has racked up more
than $24 billion in spill-related
expenses and has estimated it
will pay a total of $42 billion to

fully resolve its liability for the
disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.

Flood kills
23, displaces
thousands
A U.N. official in flood-hit
Mozambique says at least $15
million in aid is needed to help
after flood waters have killed 38
people and displaced hundreds
of thousands.
The U.N. says more than
150,000 have been displaced by
flooding in the southern African
nation of Mozambique over the
last several days. Marie Con-
selee Mukangendo, of the U.N.
children's agency UNICEF, said
Tuesday the overall death toll
stands at 38.
Mukangendo said the Chika-
halani camp alone is holding
an estimated 65,000 people but
has only 28 latrines. She called
the situation dire. The U.N. said
it estimates at least $15 million
would initially be needed in
relief aid.
Mozambique suffered record
floods in 2000 that killed more
than 700 people.

he said, could have seeped into
void spaces inside the barge.
Lally said a plan to pump oil
from the stricken barge onto
another barge - a process
knodwn as lightering - had been
approved but it was unclear
how long that would take or
when the river might reopen to
vessels..He said the other barge

was in route.
Environmental impact, Lally
said, has been minimal because
a boom is containing the leak
around the bargwe and the leak
is slow.
On Tuesday, tugs were pin-
ning the ruptured barge to the
bank on the Louisiana side of
the river, across from Vicks-
burg's Riverwalk and Lady
Luck casinos. Their engines
churned the muddy water for
which the Mississippi is so
famous. A few workers could
be seen walking on top of the
stricken barge.
An orange boom bobbed in
the water just downstream and
another boom was set up as a
second line of defense to keep
the oil from spreading.
The economic impact is
another matter.
At least 54 vessels, includ-
ing towboats and barges, were
idled Tuesday on the closed
16-mile stretch of one of the
nation's vital commerce routes.
Vessel traffic tends to be
less in January than during

peak harvest season, when
grain from the U.S. heartland
is shipped south to be loaded
onto massive ships near New
Orleans.
"The Coast Guard advised
our hazardous materials unit
that the river would be closed
indefinitely to all traffic," Lt.
Julie Lewis of the Louisiana
State Police said.
About 168.4 million tons of
cargo a year moves along the
Mississippi River between
Baton Rouge, La., and the
mouth of the Ohio River, car-
ried by nearly 22,300 cargo
ships and 162,700 barges,
according to the Army Corps
of Engineers. About 3.6 million
tons of cargo is handled annu-
ally by the port of Vicksburg.
When low water threatened
to close the river earlier this
month, the tow industry trade
group American Waterways
Operators estimated that 7.2
million tons of commodities
worth $2.8 billion might be
sidelined over the last three
weeks of January.

Urges end to
Security Council
overcome divisions
UNITED NATIONS (AP)
- The international envoy to
Syria told the Security Council
on Tuesday that "Syria is being
destroyed bit by bit" and his
mediation effort cannot go for-
ward unless the council unites
to push the Syrian government
and opposition forces toward
some compromise.
The Security Council has
been divided over Syria for
months, with the United States,
Britain, France and other West-
ern powers backing the armed
opposition and pushing for res-
olutions that raised the threat
of sanctions. Three times, Rus-
sia and China have cast vetoes
to block those resolutions.
"I'm embarrassed to be
repeating the same thing: Syria
is being destroyed," Lakhdar
Brahimi, the joint U.N-Arab
League envoy to Syria, said
after closed-door consultations
with the Security Council.
Brahimi blamed both Syr-
ian President Bashar Assad's
government and the Western-
backed opposition forces.
"Objectively, they are coop-
erating to destroy Syria. Syria is
being destroyed bit by bit. And
in destroying Syria, the region
is being pushed into a situa-
tion that is extremely bad, and
extremely important for the
entire world," Brahimi said.
He said that is why the Secu-
rity Council has a duty to over-
come its divisions.
Brahimi suggested that the

Security Council revisit the
Geneva Communique of June
2012, a broad but ambiguous
proposal endorsed by the West-
ern powers and Russia to pro-
vide a basis for negotiations.
Assad's role in any transi-
tion government was a red line
during the negotiations of the
Geneva Communique, and was
left vague. The United States
and Russia continue to dis-
agree on Assad's role, though
both signed off on the commu-
nique.
Brahimi says the Secu-
rity Council should now look
toward the provisions of the
Geneva Communique as a solu-
tion.
"A very critical element is the
creation of this governing body,
which is really a transition gov-
ernment, with full executive
powers," Brahimi said.
"I think there was a very
clever creative ambiguityinthis
creation, but I told them that
ambiguity has to be lifted now.
Now you have to say what those
full executive powers would be.
All the powers of state have got
to go to that government," he
told reporters outside the coun-
cil.government-funded Korea
Institute of Geoscience and
Mineral Resources.
Without a council push on
the Assad government and
opposition, the Geneva Com-
munique and his mediation
"cannot be implemented as it
is.
Brahimi addressed wide-
spread rumors that he was
about to quit, as his predeces-
sor, former U.N. secretary-
general Kofi Annan, did last
year when he ran into a similar
impasse.

Threat of atomic
device could worsen
nation's isolation
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -
With North Korea appearing set
to detonate an atomic device, the
U.N. agency that detected two
previous tests says itis preparedto
confirm anexplosion when it takes
place. But experts say it might be
difficult to establish whether the
blast is nuclear in nature.
The best indication of a test
will be seismic tremors and gases
released into the air, phenom-
ena that the Preparatory Com-
mission for the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty identi-
fied from previous testing.
The Vienna-based organiza-
tion's most potent detection tools
are more than 150 seismic sta-
tions across the globe. Although
very small in yield, North Korea's
first test in 2006 was picked upby
the CTBTO, as was a second test

in 2009.
Last week, North Korea
warned that it plans a third
nuclear test to protest tough-
ened international sanctions
meant to punish it for firing a
long-range rocket in December.
The world sees the launch as a
ballistic missile test banned by
the U.N., while Pyongyang says
it launched a satellite into orbit
as part of a peaceful space devel-
opment program.
The U.S., South Korea and
their allies have pressed the
North to scrap its nuclear test
plans, saying it will only worsen
the country's decades-old inter-
national isolation.
The threats have placed scien-
tists and experts in South Korea
-on high alert as any test is likely
to aggravate tensions on the
Korean Peninsula.
South Korea's Defense Minis-
try said Tuesday it believes North
Korea has nearly completed its
nuclear test preparations, con-
firming satellite analysis last

week by the U.S.-Korea Institute,
a research group at the Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies.
Its satellite images' of the
Punggye-ri site - where the pre-
vious two tests were conducted
- show that the North Koreans
may have been sealing a tunnel
into a mountain where a nuclear
device would be detonated.
In the event of such an under-
ground nuclear test, both the
CTBTO facilities and earthquake
monitoring stations in South
Koreacan detectseismic tremors.
But although this is a strong
indication of a test, it is not an
absolute confirmation.
An earthquake expert at the
state-run Korea Meteorological
Administration said his office
aims to find out the magnitude
of the tremor, the time it started
and the exact location on the map
within 10 minutes of the explo-
sion. He spoke on condition of
anonymity because he wasn't
authorized to speak to the media.

Equal funding, unequal opportunity
Comprehensive education reform is needed in Michgan
n the face of economic downturn, Michigan has struggled to ade-
quately fund its education system. Last week, however, Michi-
gan Sen. Rick Jones (R-Grand Ledge) introduced proposals that
would make public education funding equal across the state. While his
bills bring focus to an important policy conversation, these proposals
won't solve the larger problem of embarrassingly low-funded public
education in Michigan. More comprehensive education reform must
be enacted across local, state and federal levels.

romI classrIJ1oERS
From classroom, to camaraderie

Jones's bills would phase in equal per-
pupil funding within the next 10 years. The
first of his proposals aims to amend the state
constitution to ensure that by the 2020-2021
state fiscal year, schools will be guaranteed
equal per-pupil funding throughout Michi-
gan's public school districts. Jones says it's
unfair that some districts receive roughly
$7,000 per student, while others receive up
to $10,000 or more. Jones also plans on intro-
ducing a separate bill that will assist public
schools with busing costs, especially those in
rural areas. This bill will pay public schools
50 cents per mile toward school transporta-
tion costs.
Through his various proposals, Jones
hopes to overcome the setbacks created by
Proposal A, which passed in March 1994
and was designed to close the spending gap
between public school districts. But over the
years, the disparity between districts has
grown. Proposal A tied school funding direct-
ly to the number of pupils present in each dis-

trict. However, there are several components,
like the economic status of a school district's
residents, that make Michigan's failing fund-
ing system much more complex than this.
State funds are only-one of three components
of per-pupil funding.
The three levels of public education fund-
ing - local, state and federal - all play an
essential role in Michigan's public school
system. On the local level, schools are aided
by property taxes. This becomes a problem
for school districts in low-income neighbor-
hoods. Federal aid may attempt to level the
playing field by assisting these low-income
communities, but the state government is still
left to cover the bulk of costs. In order to real-
ly solve this funding crisis, local and federal
funding systems must be reformed as well.
By solely focusing on state funds, Michi-
gan fails to consider which school districts
need more aid due to possible socioeconomic
factors. Though Jones's proposal to equalize
state funds brings attention to Michigan's

focused on the Flamingo craps
table - the bones bouncing as if in
a dance, the table hushed as if col-
lectively conjuring a spell - and
he's definitely not listening to me.
Our other friend Josh however, is.
"Joe," he says, turning to me with a
face full of awe that only the star of
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II:
The Secret of the ooze" deserves,
"That is Vanilla Ice."
The magnitude of this revelation
is - unlike our mid-level Las Vegas
hotel - all-inclusive. The man looks
like Robert Matthew Van Winkle
simply because he is Robert Mat-
thew Van Winkle. And on our last
night in a city that goes to extreme
lengths to disprove reality, I'm
reminded that some things are real.
They exist; they endure; they last.
Terry was my high-school speech
teacher. I competed on his team for
threeyears, and overthe past decade
we have grown to be good friends.
Last week, I flewto Las Vegas for the
most necessary of rites: the bachelor
party. In March, I'll attend his wed-
ding. At some point I stopped being
his student and he stopped being my
teacher. We are friends.
The classroom, any classroom, is
at its best when both comfortable
and challenging. Learning needs

rules, but it also needs and builds
trust. Students and teachers share a
brief but valuable bond, and though
this closeness occasionally mani-
fests in troubling ways - despite
their uncommonness, we're now
unsurprised to hear of classroom
romances or more extreme and
unwanted advances - schools take
great care to educate faculty on the
risks and repercussions of inappro-
priate relationships. Our Office of
Institutional Equity cautions gradu-
ate student instructors and faculty
that romantic relationships - even
if they're believed to be consen-
sual - are inherently problematic
because they begin in an unequal
power dynamic between teacher
and student.
But what about friendship? I
remain in touch with many former
teachers, just as I remain in touch
with many former students. When
did Terry stop being my teacher and
become the friend who helped me
creep on Vanilla Ice for 20 uninter-
rupted minutes?
I suppose any answer must
return in part to the idea of equality.
Friends, for their myriad differences
and occasional disagreements, must
see each other as equals. They must
value, on par with their own, the
hopes and fears and gifts and gaffes
of the other. Even if total equality is
impossible, the pursuit of it is not.
Academia is fond of analytical
thinking, and to assess friendship
in these terms may seem calculat-
irig and distant. Isn't friendship
a natural process, one of the few
mysterious wonders left, even in
the quantitative world of Facebook
"friends" and Twitter followers?
Moreover, by actively examining
equality, do we push it further away?
Maybe. But what is learning? What
is curiosity, if not the deliberate and
sustained effort to step outside of

our known world to better under-
stand ourselves? Perhaps friend-
ships developed between one-time
teachers and students are as much
about considering our own capacity
for friendship as they are expecting
friendship in return.
Friends must see
-each other as
equals.
I don't have a full answer. What I
know is this: In my class, we aren't a
group of friends. I hope friendships
do form among students in class, but
that isn't my primary goal, nor do I
seek out friends, favorites or "stars."
We are, first and foremost, fellow
readers and writers abiding by the
same contract. Sharing (hopefully)
a common aim, with me often - but
not always.- serving as the guide.
After class is over, I don't write
recommendation letters or serve as
references for friends; I stand up for
talented and thoughtful students.
Not long after we saw him, Mr.
Ice raised an issue with Terry's
throwing of the bones. We weren't
delivering the numbers he needed.
He told us that he needed different
numbers and went to the next table
over. Eventually, Terry crapped out
and we wondered what tattoos we'd
get on our knuckles.
Mine, without question, would be
"READ" and "RITE."

Cant ight fire with fire


On Jan. 22, four people were injured during
a shooting on the Lone Star College campus in
Houston, Texas. This comes in the wake of sev-
eral otherschoolshootings, including the tragic
Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. In
the days following violent shootings across the
country, two solutions have been proposed by
both gun-control and gun-rights advocates that
include reducing and increasing access to these
weapons, respectively. The latter is a danger-
ous response advocated by some supporters of
gun rights and may even lead to more destruc-
tion. While some legislators are pushing for
an increased presence of guns on our campus,
they're not considering the possible repercus-
sions of arming the student body. Proposed leg-
islation in Texas would allow students to carry
concealed weapons on campus, but would this
really eradicate the problem? Or would it make
it worse?
After the shooting at Lone Star College,
Texas lawmakers are pushing the Campus
Personal Protection Act, a bill that allows
concealed weapons on college campuses. The
argument behind this proposal is if more of the
"good guys" are armed, then civilians can pro-
tect themselves and prevent tragic incidents.
The Michigan legislature also had this idea
back in December, but thankfully, Gov. Rick
Snyder vetoed the bill. In fact, Snyder related
his opposition toward the bill back to his own
days as a resident adviser at the University of
Michigan, when a student began firinga shot-
gun, killing a fellow resident adviser and a stu-
dent on Good Friday in 1981.
Fighting fire with fire only makes the issue

worse. If students on our campus were armed,
then I would feel more at risk, not safer. Yes,
it's true that those who will have a concealed
weapon will have extensive training, but when
thrown into dangerous situations people can
be impulsive and extremely reckless, especially
college students. Take, for example, the shooter
at Lone Star College who was set off by some-
one bumping into him.
Adding guns to a college campus wouldn't
increase the feeling of safety - it would do
the opposite. According to a recent study from
the University of Toledo, nine out of 10 facul-
ty members believed it would be a bad idea to
allow concealed weapons on a college campus.
The University of Toledo sent questionnaires to
1,125 faculty members at 15 randomly selected
state universities. 97 percentof faculty mem-
bers at Kent State, the University of Toledo and
Ohio University felt safe on campus, 94 percent
opposed concealed-carry and 82 percent said
they would feel less safe if faculty, students and
visitors were allowed to carry guns.
Our current firearm regulation system is
not perfect and, as exemplified in countless
other shootings since Columbine, gun control
is a complex issue. The last thing schools need
is an additional threat to their safety. If legis-
lators want to look for a solution, they should
take a look at the accessibility of guns. Instead
of trying to add more guns to the equation,
they should be increasing safety measures and
taking steps to ensure guns don't fall into the
wrong hands.

"Free" software isn't
aboutprice
TO THE DAILY:
A Jan. 17 article "Freedom soft-
ware advocate warns about privacy
concerns" erred when describing
me as an "open source advocate."
In 1983,Ifounded the free software
movement to win freedom for com-
puter users. The "free" in free soft-
ware refers to freedom, not price.
Therefore, please describe me as a
"free software advocate". ,

The term "open source" was
coined in 1998 by people who want-
ed to bury the free software ideals.
They have a right to their views, but
I disagree with them, so it is mis-
leading to use "open" or "closed" to
say where I stand.
I didn't speak of "surveillance
that Stalin can only dream of," since
Stalin died in 1953. I said "could."
Here's a list of shocking examples
of digital surveillance - there are
many more.
I think the article was unfair to
the Luddites. They didn't blindly
oppose technology. Rather, they

fought technology that caused mas-
sive unemployment and poverty -
as is the case in the United States
today.
The article ends with a cor-
rection stating, accurately, that I
didn't develop Linux. Linux is a
kernel that was started by Linus
Torvalds in 1991. However, when
people say "Linux operating sys-
tem," they mean the operating sys-
tem I started in 1984, which is the
GNU system.

Berki said that it is important
to involve more University stu-
dents in sustainability research,

education and outreach. There are
currently 600 courses on sustain-
ability offered at the University.
"I would really like to see stu-
dents get really involved in (Cen-
tral Student Government and,
the Student Sustainability Initia-
tive)," Berki said. "Theyboth have
strong environmental interests
(and) they advocate for environ-
mental sustainability in an orga-
nized fashion."
Berki said he's pleased with the
effort the University has made
toward sustainability.
"The one thing that I'm most
proud of is the holistic approach
we take here," Berki said. "More
focus is being put on sustainabil-
ity on all levels."
Don Scavia, director of the
Graham Environmental Sustain-

ability Institute, said two focuses
of research are energytechnology
and consumer choice.
"I think there's some really
important research going on in
energy technologies," Scavia said.
But Scavia said research is
practical only if students are edu-
cated in sustainability practices
that they canbringback into their
personal lives.
"Everyone - in our personal
lives - needs to think carefully
about how we use energy, how we
use water, how much waste we
generate," Scavia said. "We need
to find ways to use less and be
more efficient in what we use."

"Those who receive (awards)
today join a distinguished com-
pany," Delbanco said.
After the presentation of the
awards, David Grann, a staff
writer for The New Yorker, read
excerpts from his works of non-
fiction. Gran said he admired
the Hopwood program because
of its ability to inspire up-and-
coming authors.
"In a time where, as a writer,
I'm keenly aware of the diffi-
culty and dwindling resources
to create an environment where
cultural young writers can
thrive, I want to pay a particular
attribute to the recipients today,
and also to this program, which
is really a value in this day and
age," Grann said.
LSA sophomore Tessa Wiles
won $800 in the Hopwood fic-
tion category for three satire
pieces entitled "How to Domi-
nate an Industry," written from
the perspective of John Mayer,
"The Danger in Associating
with a Blameless Nailfile," writ-
ten from the perspective of a

nail file and "The Tale of Joan

from the perspective of Joan
Rivers.
She said she entered the piec-
es on a whim, and was excited
and shocked upon learning.she
had won.
"I never expected works
about John Mayer and Joan Riv-
ers to win a distinguished writ-
ing prize," Wiles said.
LSA sophomore Yoav Gaffney
also won in the fiction category.
His piece, "Stories about Jeru-
salem," was inspired by the year
he spent in Jerusalem. lie won
$1,000.
"I didn't think I was going
to win," Gaffney said. "I didn't
think I was going to submit it
honestly, but my English teacher
told meI should."
For the fiction, nonfiction and
poetry Hopwood awards, two
judges in each division read the
entries and made recommenda-
tions. Prizes were awarded to
each judge's first and second-
place choices, and the combinel
score for each contestant deter-
mined the amount of the prizes
the contestants received. Entries

where students and tutors could
work together from across the

InstaEDU was launched last
May, and continues to look for
more tutors, including tutors
from the University.
"We have Michigan tutors
that we really, really love," Ali-
son said.
InstaEDU. users create a
profile and then are'able to see
through Facebook or Gchat
plugins whether tutors are
online and available. Once a stu-
dent puts in a request, he or she
is matched with whichever tutor
responds first in InstaEDU's
online classroom. At the core of
InstaEDU is an ability to get stu-
dents help the second they need
it, Alison said.
"That whole setup is designed
to give students and tutors either

rial)."

BUDGET
From Page 1A
bringing a popular music artist
to perform in Hill Auditorium in
the spring. These events will be
sponsored through the CSG dis-
cretionary funds.
After the CSG assembly
meeting last Tuesday, Osborn
stressed the importance of
increasing the budgeted spend-
ing for SOFC.
Though Osborn said MUSIC
Matters was a "great student
organization" bringing a new
event to campus, he said he
wanted to ensure that CSG
would oversee its planning.
"What I wanted to explicate
-to everyone was that if we were
going to sponsor MUSIC Mat-
ters with such a large amount,
CSG should be involved with the
event," Osborne said.
The proposed funding toward
SOFC was increased by about
$8,000. Furthermore, the fund-
ing towards MUSIC Matters
was increased from $8,000
to $10,000, and the funding
towards the St. Patrick's Day
Tailgate was increased from
$8,000 to $15,000 dollars.
LSA representative Arielle
Zupmore, an organizer of MUSIC
Matters, suggested that represen-
tative involvement in the event
could include helping the group
with the organization of Spring-
Fest - a culmination of student
organizations on campus before
the concert. CSG members could
also be members of the "artist-
selection committee" for the
concert and help determine any

environmental implications of the
upcoming concert.
"Thankfully, we were able to
compromise," Osborne said. "We
will hopefully be able to allocate
more funds toward student orga-.
nizations on campus that need
it."
To be able to accommodate
for the increases in the budgeted
expenses for about $2,200 was
reallocated from the originally
budgeted funding for CSG Com-
missions. Additionally, $500 was
taken from each of the legislative
and discretionary accounts and.
the proposed $35,000 towards
graduate childcare subsidy was
cut in half.
As per an agreement last
spring between the GEO and
university administrators, the
CSG would provide a total of
$150,000 over the course of two
years to subsidize parts of the
childcare costs of graduate stu-
dent instructors and graduate
student staff assistants.
"Because the Office of Finan-
cial Aid has been very difficult
with getting back to us on seeing
whether this is a pilot program
we can actually implement, we
decided to only provide $17,500
this semester," Osborn said.
"Hopefully we will be able to
provide the other $17,500 during
the fall semester."
Though the budget was
approved as final during the
meeting, Osborn noted that
changes in student enrollment
before the drop/add deadline
could affect CSG revenue from
student fees by up to $5,000. Any
such changes will be addressed
in the next assembly meeting.

GRANT
From Page 1A
said an addition to the program
is very much needed. Currently,
the conservation lab is manned
by six staff members who work
on both the general and special
collections. The amount of work
covered by the employees is
"overwhelming," Zachary wrote
in an e-mail interview Monday.
"The new conservation librar-
ian will expand our capacity to
treat rare books and manage
conservation projects as well as
provide outreach to help other
organizations in the region care
for their libraries," Zachary
wrote.
Many of the books and proj-
ects are detached from their
bindings or have damaged pages,
Zachary said. Some of these
projects include theater post-
ers from an early 20th-century
Shakespeare Company, a Turk-
ish manuscript by Ebu Bekir
Nusret dating back to 1765 and
a pamphlet from the Hubbard
Collection of Imaginary Voyages
circa 1867.
Bryan Skib, associate Uni-
versity librarian for collections,
wrote in an e-mail Tuesday that
the Graduate Library's addition-
al position will help provide for
the library's future
"The additional staff will
help us keep up with the local

demand for conservation ser-
vices, and will enhance our abil-
ity to train future generations of
conservators," Skib wrote.
Skib, the Graduate Library's
former development officer, is
exploring several options to
raise another $1 million to match
the Mellon grant and support
the addition of the new librarian.
"Donors have in recent years
shown strong interest in sup-
porting our conservation pro-
grams," Skib wrote. "The Mellon
grant will provide them with a
wonderful opportunity to make
a significant, long-term contri-
bution that will serve to extend
the useful life of the Library col-
lections."
Zachary said she is optimis-
tic that additional funds can be
raised.
"Our experience has been that
many people are enthusiastic
about the preservation of books
- especially of the extraordi-
nary collections in the U-M
Library," Zachary said.
Dean of Libraries Paul Cou-
rant said in a statement that
the grant will be an invalu-
able resource for the University
Library.
. "We're enormously grate-
ful to the Mellon Foundation
for their support, which will
enhance our ability to preserve
the cultural and scholarly record
and to share our holdings with
the world."

Pres. has yet
to hold press
conference on
drug cartel battle
MEXICO CITY (AP) - Two
months after President Enrique
Pena Nieto took office promis-
ing to reduce violent crime, the
killings linked to Mexico's drug
cartels continue unabated.
Only the government's talk
about them has dropped.
Eighteen members of a band
and its retinue were kidnapped
and apparently slain over the
weekend in the northern border
state of Nuevo Leon by gunmen
who asked them to name their
cartel affiliation before they
were shot and dumped in a well.
Fourteen prisoners and nine
guards died in an attempted
prison escape in Durango state.
Nine men were slain Christmas
eve in Sinaloa. In the state of
Mexico, which borders the capi-
tal, more than a dozen bodies
were found last week, some dis-
membered.
The difference under this
administration is that there have
been no major press conferences
announcing more troops or federal
police for drug-plagued hotspots.
Gone are the regular parades of
newly arrested drug suspects
before the media with their weap-
ons, cashor contraband.
Pena Nieto has been mum,
instead touting education, fis-
cal and energy reforms. On
Monday, he told a summit of
Latin American and Caribbean
leaders in Chile that he wants
Mexico to focus on being a play-
er in solving world and regional
problems.
Some political observers
praise him for trying to change
the conversation and presenting
an alternative face of Mexico.
Critics suggest the country's
new leaders believe that the
best way to solve a security cri-
sis is to create distractions.
"What Pena Nieto is doing is
... sweeping violence under the
rug in hopes that no one notic-
es," said security expert Jorge
Chabat. "It can be effective in
the short term, until the vio-
lence becomes so obvious that

you can't change the subject."
The Pena Nieto government
declined to respond publicly to
the critics. But in an interview
last month with The Associated
Press, he said he would not put
any goals or deadlines on his
campaign against organized
crime and would focus on pre-
vention.
"That way we avoid generat-
ing fertile ground where vio-
lence and insecurity can keep
growing," Pena Nieto said.
Secretary of Interior Jose
Osorio Chong had a closed-door
meeting with the governors of
Mexico's central states about
security on Monday. In a press
conference afterward, he prom-
ised to increase patrols along a
highway system already bris-
tling with military and police
roadblocks and checkpoints.
The apparent weekend kill-
ing of 18 members of Kombo
Kolombia, which had played
at a private performance late
Thursday, was the largest mass
kidnapping and killing since
20 tourists disappeared and
were later found dead in 2011
near the resort city of Acapulco.
Searchers this week were pull-
ing bodies from a well in north-
ern Mexico that they said likely
belonged to the band.
An area known as the
Laguna, where Coahuila and
Durango states meet, has been
the scene of numerous battles
between factions of the Sinaloa
and the Zetas cartels.
The State of Mexico has had
70 slayings so far this year,
according to Gov. Eruviel Avila.
La Familia has moved in from
the neighboring state of Micho-
acan and is fighting for territory
with a smaller gang known as
the United Warriors. Mean-
while, masked vigilantes patrol
towns in the southern state of
Guerrero on the Pacific coast,
where citizens have grown tired
of organized crime usurping
local authority.
Communications expert
Ruben Aguilar said the Pena
Nieto government is right to
change the focus from security,
which had been the main topic
throughout the six-year admin-
istration of President Felipe
Calderon, who left office on
Dec. 1.

Head of Egyptian
military says
country unstable

Amid political
violence, military
leader expresses
concern
PORT SAID, Egypt (AP) -
Residents of this Mediterranean
coastal city burying their dead
from Egypt's wave of political vio-
lence vented their fury at Egypt's
Islamist president and the Mus-
lim Brotherhood on Tuesday,
demanding his ouster and virtu-
ally declaring a revolt against his
rule, as the head of the military
warned Egypt may collapse under
the weight of its turmoil.
Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi'
strongly worded comments,
his first since the crisis began,
appeared aimed at pushing both
sides in Egypt's political divide
to reconcile and find a solution
to the rapidly spreading protests
and riots across much of the
country the past six days.
But his breaking of his
silence falls heaviest on Presi-
dent Mohammed Morsi, who
has been unable to contain the
unrestby trying a tough hand, as
protesters defied his declaration
of a month-long state of emer-
gency and curfew in Port Said
and two neighboring cities.

At least 60 people have been
killed and hundreds injured since
Thursday in clashes between
police and protesters angry over
what they call Islamists' moves
to monopolize power and failure
to address the country's multiple
woes. In his comments, el-Sissi
signaled the military would not
move to put down protesters, say-
ingtroops are ina"grave predica-
ment," forced to balance between
"avoiding confrontation" with
citizens and protectingstate insti-
tutions.
In Cairo on Tuesday, rock-
,throwing protesters clashed
with police firing tear gas for
another day in battles that esca-
lated after nightfall near Tahrir
Square. The mayhem forced the
nearby U.S. Embassy to suspend
public services Tuesday, and the
night before masked men tried
to rob the neighboring five-star
Semiramis Hotel, a Cairo land-
mark, trashing the lobby before
being forced out.
Protesters in many cities
around the country have battled
police, cut off roads and rail-
way lines and besieged govern-
ment offices and police stations.
But the most dramatic fray-
ing of state control has been in
the three cities along the Suez
Canal, particularly Port Said, at
the canal's Mediterranean end.

al invention. From $10
But don't go
in expecting to
see the same show Marsalis put
on in 2012 for his 50th birthday
or, for that matter, anythingsim-
ilar to the other 13 visits he has
made to the University's campus
through University Music Soci-
ety. This one, like all the others
before it, is going to be different.
"We have a setlist of all of the
music that we have played (at
Hill Auditorium) within the last
at least 15 years," JLCO drum-
mer Ali Jackson said. "We never
try to repeat the same music
we've played. Every time we
come, we play a different setlist."
Jackson, a Detroit native who

went on to study with jazz leg-
ends Max Roach and Elvin Jones
in New York, spends over a third
of the year touring with the
other 14 members of the orches-
tra - a testament to the group's
commitment to keeping jazz
alive and relevant.
"It's one of the greatest art
forms our.country has ever pro-
duced, if not the greatest," Jack-
son said. "There's going to be
very few opportunities from this
point in time moving forward
where you'll hear an ensemble
this size with this quality of
musicians. It becomes more and
more rare. This is something
that (people will) tell their kids
about one day."
It's with this understanding
of jazz's depreciating relevance
among the average American
listener that JLCO constructs its
tours, shows and programs.
"Education is the future of
any idiom. If you can't get good
information, then you basically
will not sustain your art form,"
Jackson said. "It is very crucial
that we educate young people,
middle-aged people, old people
- all people about jazz music
and every aspect of jazz music
and the cultural component that
makes jazz and its art form so
unique."
JLCO's devotion to education
comes in the form of workshops,
seminars and narrated concerts.
"Essentially Ellington," which
expanded its availability to all
50 states in 1999, is a free, year-
long high school program focus-
ing on the life and work of Duke
Ellington. Through mentorship,
student conferences and an

eventual year-end festival, stu-
dents explore Ellington's major
work and hone their craft in the
process.
Musicians of all talent levels
can also work with members
of JLCO at.the Irene Diamond
Education Center at Frederick
P. Rose Hall in New York City,
where cliqics and workshops
are held when the orchestra isn't
touring.
"Whether you're a young
musician and you want to know
more about jazz, or you're just a
fan of the music or however you
come to the music, there's infor-
mation out here," Jackson said.
For Jackson and the other
members of JLCO, the edu-
cational responsibility that
comes with playing with one of
the best jazz orchestras in the
world has evolved into a way of
life.
"If I go to Minnesota, for
example, and I know the teach-
ers and educators there and
they say, 'Hey man, Ali, can you
come by my school and work on
my rhythm section?' (I'm) more
than happy to," Jackson said.
But similar to the one hap-
pening on campus this Thurs-
day, shows at large venues like
Hill are particularly crucial for
expanding jazz's listenership
and influence. The members of
JLCO will be playing some of
the most renowned music the
genre currently has to offer,
in hopes that the sound they
are celebrating from their own
25-year history and long before
will be resonating in the ears of
their audience for days to come.
Or, perhaps, for a lifetime.

"Go ahead Academy, make my day."
Jamie Foxx is one
exceptional Oscar snub

By CONRAD FOREMAN
Daily Arts Writer
Oscar nominations were
announced recently and, as
always, there were several snubs
and surprises. One of the most
discussed snubs, especially
among some of my co-workers
here at the Daily, is Leonardo
DiCaprio not receiving a nomi-
nation for Best Supporting Actor
for his role as Calvin Candie in
"Django Unchained." As good as
I believe his performance was,
Christoph Waltz deservedly
received the nomination instead.
Not to mention that Leo's snub
wasn't the biggest to come out of
"Django": It's acrime that Jamie
Foxx isn't nominated for Best
Actor.
Perhaps it's because his co-
stars turned in such phenomenal
performances in their over-the-
top roles, but it seems to me that
Foxx isn't receiving the proper
recognition for',the amazing job
he did as the titular role in Quen-
tin Tarantino's latest master-
piece.
It's natural that Foxx would

be overlooked. His character is
quiet for much of the film. This,
however, makes his performance
all the more impressive. The eyes
are the most expressive feature
of an actor, and Foxx is able to
convey powerful emotion with
them, in spite of his sparse dia-
logue. When Dr. King Schultz
gives him a beer, Foxx takes a sip,
then stares down at the beer with
subtle surprise and intrigue, as if
to say, "Oh, so that's what it tastes
like." This is a miniscule detail
that's easy to overlook, but that
stood out to me as Foxx going the
extra mile in his role.
On the other hand, when Djan-
go does decide to speak up, dam-
mit can he steal a scene. Upon
arrival at Candie Land, he gives
Calvin Candie's henchmen a
tongue-lashing that sets the tone
for his character for the rest of
the film. He then goes.toe-to-toe
with Candie himself, not backing
down when Candie expresses his
curiosity in Django, instead look-
ing him in the eye and stating,
"I'm curious what makes you so
curious." A simple line, yes, but
Foxx's delivery makes it great

and makes it known to Candie
that Django is not a man to be
messed with.
I recently had an hour-long
debate with my roommate, in
which I defended "Django" as
an incredible movie and well
deserving of its 'Best Picture
nomination. You could say that
there are better, more productive
ways to spend your time at 3 a.m.,
and you'd probably be right. But
hey, it's my job (sort of). Among
the things we disagree upon is
Django's speech at the end of the
film. He thinks that it is unim-
pressive and unnecessary. But I
remember seeing that scene and
being blown away by the sheer
badassness of Django.
Why is
DiCaprio
getting all of the
sympathy? <
The two most important fac-
tors, to me, in measuring, the
greatness of a performance are
the ability to capture the audi-
ence's attention' and believ-
ability. Foxx possesses both in
"Django." Even when Christoph
Waltz is delivering his lines with
slicing precision right next to
him, my eyes were always curi-
ous to see what Django is doing
in the background - how he's
reactingto the scene and absorb-
ing his surroundings. As for
believability - from the opening
sequence of the film, Foxx takes
on the character completely,
while also injecting some of that
signature swagger that helped
him win the Best Actor Oscar
for "Ray."
Unfortunately, come Oscar
night, Jamie Foxx will be just
a spectator like the rest of us
(at least as far as the individual
awards are concerned), rooting
on his co-star, Waltz. I imagine
(hope) he'll get drunk and even-
tually break out into a chorus
of "Gold Digger" at some bar at
3 a.m., already having forgotten
about the Oscars and deep into
preparation for "The Amazing
Spider-Man 2." But he knows,
and I like to think he knows I
know, that he deserves to be,
nominated. He plays his charac-
ter with emotion and intensity -
a badass in love who is smart and
cunning - like a Foxx.

class, something he or anyone in
Ann Arbor hasn't been able to say
:in more than 20 years.
He told his class, and the play-
ers, that the Michigan basketball
=team was the No. 1 team in the
-country. Now sitting in Colas'
class, Robinson wasn't born the
last time that happened.
The players recieved a stand-
ing ovation from their class-

mates.
"A smile broke out across our
faces," Robinson said. "But it's
business. The hardest thing is
staying on top."
* Michigan (6-1 Big Ten, 19-1
overall) will most likely be
without its starting center, red-
shirt junior Jordan Morgan,
on Wednesday when it tips off
against Northwestern at the
Crisler Center.
Morgan suffered a right-ankle
injury less than two minutes into
Michigan's 74-60 victory over
Illinois on Sunday.
While Michigan coach John
Beilein said that the ankle was
probably sprained and an X-ray
showed no sign of a broken bone.
He did say there was "a lot of dis-
coloration" in the ankle, and that
he didn't expect Morgan to prac-
tice or play in the next couple
days.
Michigan's leading big man
has started all 20 games this
season, averaging a little over
six points and five rebounds per
game. His numbers don't tell the
whole story, though, as Morgan
is seen as the vocal and physical
leader of the defense.
"Jordan has really learned
how to be a defensive special-
ist in some regard," Beilein said.
"He does a wonderful job for us

in the last line of defense ... if
everything breaks down and he
plays it poorly, we would give up
a lot oflayups."
Beilein said that they would
have "some sort of competition
in practice" to see who would be
starting in place of Morgan, but
it seems to be a decision between
freshman Mitch McGary or red-
shirt sophomore Jon Horford.
Beilein also downplayed the
significance of who starts, since
McGary and Horford will likely
play the same amount of minutes
on Wednesday.
Redshirt freshman Max Biel-
feldt, who averages less than six
minutes per game, will also play
a role in picking up Morgan's 20
minutes per game. Both poten-
tial starting big men have stam-
ina issues - Horford is coming
off a left-knee dislocation that
sidelined him for a month, and
McGary plays at such a high
intensity that he gets winded
after long stretches on the court,
so Bielfeldt will be counted
on for significant minutes on
Wednesday.
In terms of the Big Ten sched-
ule, Morgan's injury might have
come at the perfect time. On
Saturday, Michigan travels to
Bloomington to take on an offen-
sive juggernaut in No. 3 Indiana.

Wednesday, Michigan plays
Northwestern (3-5, 12-9), which
averages almost 20 points less
per game than the Hoosiers and
don'f have a big presence down
low.
The Wildcats have been deal-
ing with the loss of their best
player since December. Senior
forward Drew Crawford was
ruled out for the season after suf-
fering a right-shoulder injury.
The loss of Crawford raised a
lot of questions about the, Wild-
cats, and through a month of Big
Ten play, not many of them have
been answered.
It's been a season of incon-
sistencies so far in Big Ten play.
In the Wildcats' last game, they
lost by 15 to a Nebraska team that
had one previous conference
win. This was coming off three
straight strong performances,
including wins at then-No. 23
Illinois, at home against then-
No. 12 Minnesota and a close loss
to then-No. 2 Indiana.
It's difficult to gauge how
Michigan will play without Mor-
gan for the first time this season,
but even that's easier then trying
to figure out which Northwest-
ern team shows up.
Morgan or not, the Wolverines
shouldn't have an issue in their
first game on the No. 1 perch.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
How to be a Michigan athlete

By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
Three words bunched together
create a remarkably simple phrase
- "Be an athlete." As simple as they
might be, those words have had a
massive impact on the freshman
class of the No. 25 Michigan wom-
en's swimming and diving team.
Marni Oldershaw and Ali
Deloof, two of the team's top per-
forming freshman, have become
very familiar with those three
words over the course of their first
season at Michigan. The mantra,
"be an athlete," is the one that
Michigan coach Mike Bottom
constantly reminds his swimmers
to follow.
"It's just completely. commit-
ting yourself to what you're doing
'and being able to overcome kind of
ranything, in sport or in your life,"
Oldershaw said. "I really take that
.to the classroom, I take it to social
situations, I take it to the pool, - it
follows us." 4
The phrase itself is not imagi-
native. It's not unique. It can apply
to any athlete playing any sport at
any level. So why has this mantra
meant so much to this team and
.propelled the freshman class to
compete at such a high caliber?
It's because the Wolverines

have made the phrase their own,
something that applies only to
them. It is almost as if the fresh-
man have created a guide on how
to "be an athlete."
Team first
"You don't swim for yourself,
and I think that truly gets me
through all the hard parts, all the
hard aspects of my whole life right
now," Oldershaw said. "It's not
about me, it's about the team, and
that really helps."
The team has blossomed in the
past month, showing strength
across the board in a number of
events, and is currently 3-1 in 2013
and 4-2 in the Big Ten. The fresh-
man class has made major con-
tributions in every victory, and
senior Ashley Cohagen attributes
their success to a team commit-
ment.
"It's not about you, it's about the
people on the sidelines cheering
for you which is a really cool thing
and it really helps you get through
your races," Cohagen said.
Just keep swimming
"Whenever we're doing a hard
set, (assistant coach Mark Hill)
always says, 'Just keep moving
forward. You'll be fine, just keep
moving forward,' " Deloof said.
Added Oldershaw: "The hurt
goes away but the work you've

done will stay."
Overall, this season hasn't been
an easy one for the Wolverines.
With the retirement of former
coach Jim Richardson just before
the fall semester began, Bottom
took on the task of head coach for
both the men's and women's team,
and the entire program experi-
enced growing pains as a result.
Not only did the freshman class
have to adjust to being on a brand,
new team, it was entering an envi-
ronment no one had experienced
before.
While the adjustments may not
have been easy, the team has done
surprisingly well considering the
circumstances. Seven swimmers
currently hold top-10 ranks in the
Big Ten, and despite starting the
season with some rough losses,
the team is now 4-4 overall.
Making waves
Bottom is constantly throwing
curve balls at his team, challeng-
ing them to do more than just win.
Whether it's moving faster in the
pool or break records that have
been around for decades, his style
of coaching has prepped them to
deal with any situation and given
them the tools to surprise their
opponents.
"It's not about winning or los-
ing, it's about causing chaos or

disruption, is the way that Mike
puts it," Oldershaw said. "Beating
someone you're not supposed to
beat, going a time you're not sup-
posed to go."
The Wolverines were able to
pull this off in an underdog victo-
ry against then-No. 15 Ohio State
by surprising their opponents and
topping the scoreboard the entire
night. They won eight events dur-
ing the meet and went 2-3-4-5 in
two races, and 2-3-4 in two others,
to add to their point margin.
"Anything that's thrown our
way during meets we can handle,
but (other teams) are not as pre-
pared," Cohagen said.
The meet against Ohio State
was not one the team anticipated
winning, but by creating chaos
and doing more in the pool than
they were expected to, they came
out with the victory.
Being a college athlete is never
easy. But having to adjust to a new
environment while also dealing
with the pressures of academics
and 'team pressures makes suc-
cess all the more difficult to attain.
While its season has been far from
perfect, the women's swim team
has lived up to the mantra "be an
athlete," and the expectations for
their success are far greater than
they were a few short months ago.

8B Wednesday January 30,2013 The Statement

You're going to Hollywood
By Haley Goldberg

Name: Jayne Jaeger
Hometown: Chicago, Ill.
School: Music, Theatre & Dance
Concentration: Vocal Performance
Thisfall, Music, Theatre £t Dancefreshman Jayne Jaeger
made it to Hollywood on American Idol. What's it like to be
a contestant on America's biggest TV talent show? Jaeger
brings us back into the audition room as she recounts her
experience.
What was it like trying out for American Idol this year?
I went to the first audition in July in Chicago at the United
Center. There were probably thousands of people lined up
outside waiting to audition. It was
pretty hectic.
What happened after the United
Center audition?
After the audition at the United
Center, I had to do a couple rounds
of auditions before getting to sing for
the judges ... I did three auditions and
the fourth was in front of the judges
... Nicki Minaj, Keith Urban, Randy
Jackson and Mariah Carey.
What was it like singing in front of
the judges?
It was really scary because it was
weird seeingthem there. I've
watched the show for a really long
time, and it almost didn't seem real
that they were actually there talking
to me. But it was a cool experience.
How long were you in front ofthe
judges and what song did you sing?
Probably 10 to 15 minutes ... I sang
"I Want To Hold Your Hand" by
the Beatles but the version from the
movie "Across the Universe."
How did the judges react?
I told them that Iwas a voice performance major, so I think
that kind of tipped them off to say they didn't quite know
if they saw me as a pop singer and they were debating it
among themselves for a little bit. Then they actually had
me sing an opera song, since they knew that was whatI was
studying. So at that point I didn't really think I was going
to get through because I thought they were going to tell me
to just study opera. But in the end, three out of four of them
agreed and you need three "yeses" to get to Hollywood...

Keith said yes, Mariah said yes, Nicki said yes and Randy
said no.
Was this yourfirst time trying out for a TV talent
show?
I tried out with my sister for "America's Got Talent" when I
was younger, but I didn't even make it past the first round,
so this is my first time actually getting it together and try-
ing out for something... I tried out to see just what would
happen, and it's cool to see how far Ican make it in this
try. But if I try out again, I think I would go into it with a
lot more drive since I know the process a little bit more. I
know things that I have to fix that might help me to make it
further.

singers get discovered?
I think it's a really good opportunity not only to get your
name out there, but kind of see how the industry works in
terms of what kind of drive it would require ... because even
though (talent shows) seem like an easier way in, you'd still
have to work really hard at your image, your songchoice
- just everything in your package to make sure that it was
marketable.
Could you telliwho were the "characters" at the audi-
tions?
There were some definitely crazy people that I saw at my
Chicago audition. Once you heard people singing in the
bathroom warming up, it was easy to
tell who was kind of a joke and who
had a chance of actually making it.
And then there were some definite
characters-that ended up making it
through who had good voices and
probably didn't need their whole
physique, but it kind of added to their
whole thing.
Was your audition featured on the
show?
They didn't feature my audition, but
they flashed my face for like a second.
I was happy with that.
What advice do you have for people
trying out for TV talent shows?
I think the ultimate advice for trying
out would be know who you are as an
artist because you can make any song
work as long as you know what your
personais and can portray that and
they can tell who you are. A big thing
they said is, "We're not going to make
you into something. You have to have
it figured out and we can market it."
TERESA MATHEW/Daily That was their big critique for me -
that they didn't think I knew who I
was as an artist. And that was true because I really didn't.
You could tell there were specific people who were kind
of like Katy Perry or Jessie J, and then on the otherhand
there were the rocker girls, the Carrie Underwood girls or
the artsy Ingrid Michaelson girls. It was really important to
know what kind of singer you were, whichwas my biggest
problem.
Do you know now?
Not yet. I'd have to really work on it and think about it ifI
was going to audition again.

Do youthink you'll tryout again?
I think so. If not for "American Idol" then maybe for "The
Voice" or "The X Fator." Just because it was a really good
experience, and I didn't really lose anything from it ... I've
always been an "American Idol" fan. I've never actually
watched "The Voice" or "The X Factor," so I think this is a
good one for me to audition for since I already knew it well
enough based off watching it.

So, Devon, let's say the world
endstomorrow. What animal do
you think would have the best
chance of taking over the human
race?
Um...
And ruling them (us)?
I would say ... dogs, probably.
Dogs? Why?
Dogs form packs:They multiply.
They can live really anywhere.
But there are so many differ-
ent kinds of dogs. Would it be,

wars? Class wars between the
chiluahuas and the labradors?
I feel like the dogs would mon-
grelize very quickly.
What does that mean?
Like they would all become
mutts.
Oh, interesting. Why not?
I've read some articles that said

I haven't heard about squids.
Why?
I don't really know; I didn't
really read into it. Ijust read the
headlines that squids are most
likely to take over after the gla-
ciers melt and the waters rise,
swinging from the submerged
trees.
Uhhh ... I just don't think squids
could kill all of the other species in
the manner necessary to take over
the world.
So how are the dogs going to
take over? An uprising? Or is it
the failure of the human race to
sustain itself and so itjust dies
out?

Like what?
Like you couldn't have lions
because lions just require too much
to grow. Lions would decimate their
food source. They're too much of a
tertiary predator.
That's what they call me on

had known that was my age, on his way to col-

crying that summer but the grief and feelings
of confusion remained. It never got easier, as
dealing with death never does, but as every-
one must, I went on with my life. Over a year
later, I realize I'll never know what Shorts
was thinking or feeling that night before his
graduation; there will never be an explana-
tion, it will never be all right, but I know his
memory will never fade. A premature death
is a tragedy but it sends permanent ripples
through communities, touching everyone
near and far.

Behind the scenes with Filmic
by Austen Hufford

outtakes photo by nick williams/daily

At the end of December, Tabassum
Mohibi opened her acceptance
e-mail to the University. She imme-
diately hugged and cried with her best
friend, who also got in. The next day, Mohibi
opened up the acceptance e-mail once- again
and watched the embedded YouTube video.
"It made me want to come here even
more," Mohibi said. "When I saw the video,
it made me feel maybe I belong there."
In 92 short seconds, the video - entitled
"The Letter M" - attempts to emulate what
it means to be a Michigan Wolverine. Dining
Hall Block 'M' Belgium waffles, blue books,
the Fishbewl and the ubiquitous M-card all
make an appearance. The video has been
watched almost 70,000 times and the com-
ment section is filled by admitted students
and alumni alike.
The video, however, wasn't created by a
professional film crew or the University's
marketing department: It was envisioned
and produced by Filmic Productions, a Uni-
versity-student-run film studio.
Founded in January 2011, Filmic has been
responsible for some of the most memorable
marketing materials for University students,
including "The Michigan Transportation
Musical" and Desmond Howard's "Stay in
the Blue" video campaign, which aired in
the Big House on game days throughout the
football season.
"The last two years have been a whirl-
wind, because we haven't really stopped
making videos," said Stephanie Hamel,
Filmic producer and LSA senior.
Composed of 21 University students,
Filmic contracts projects from the Univer-
sity and other companies - as they see fit.

Smaller teams play the primary role on spe-
cific projects, but in most productions all
Filmic members play a part. .
Filmic has become known by University
administrators and staff for their unique
take on marketing. Mary Jo Desprez, the
University's alcohol and other drug policy
and prevention administrator, said their
perspective as students helps them create
a high-quality product that the campus can
relate to.
"Here's this incredible group of creative
students who all work together very well,
but they also work really professionally,"
Desprez said. "What sets them apart is the
ability to navigate those things as well as
keeping their finger on the pulse of what's
interesting and relevant to students."
Three years ago, some of the founding
members of the group were taking their first
ever film class.
In the winter semester of 2010, three of
the eventual Filmic founders become part-
ners for their Introduction to Media Pro-
duction group projects. LSA seniors Roddy
Hyduk, Steve Coffey and Josh Buoy enjoyed
collaborating in 2010, and continued to work
together in their next production class the
following semester.
The team, however, wanted to get more
production experience than just through
the Department of Screen Arts and Cultures
alone, which they felt is not solely produc-
tion-focused and includes theory and cul-
tural components.
"Our goal from the beginning was to do
more work than the production courses
offered through Screen Arts and Cultures
allowed us to," Hyduk said.

And so Filmic was formed early 2011 and
quickly found their first project: an online
contest ran by a Canadian design and man-
ufacturing firm where participants had to
make a 30-second video about how to fry an
egg. The deadline was in three weeks. The
project was just interesting enough to get
Filmic out of their notepads and behind the
camera.
Production began in earnest and soon
they had completed two whole days of film-
ing for their 30-second clip. They ended up
fifth out of about 200 entries.
In a series of coincidences, Filmic quickly
progressed from entering free-for-all online
contests to producing professional videos for
the University.
Business Prof. Thomas Lyon is the father
of one of Filmic's founding members and
owned the house where they filmed their
egg video. After viewing the final product,
Lyon asked the group to produce a promo-
tional video for the Erb Institute - a group
which promotes using business to create an
environmentally sustainable society. Filmic
spent most of winter 2011 semester produc-
ing that video.
"We didn't necessarily have a specific type
of work we wanted to get to. We just wanted
to create content and do it well;" Hyduk said.
"The Erb Institute was the first opportunity
to create content for the University and that
kind of just kept leading to more and more
opportunities."
Upon completion, two Filmic members
showed the video to Dean of Students Laura
Blake Jones. A few weeks later - now the
summer of 2011 - Jones offered Filmic the
chance to produce four short public service

announcements for the Sexual Assault Pre-
vention and Awareness Center, the Spectrum
Center, Expect Respect and Stay in the Blue.
Filmic accepted the project and began
working. They had one month to come up
with the ideas and another month to produce
the films.
"It was when we learned to best work
with one another as a team because we had
.to finish four PSAs in two months," said LSA
senior Chris Duncin, one of Filmic's original
members.
Group members-said they learned to work
on tight deadlines through trial, error and
many sleep deprived nights - skills which
continue to affect how Filmic works. They
spent long hours during summer 2011 work-
ing together as a team. According to Filmic,
each 30-second PSA required about 300
hours of work.
The PSAs were shown at home foot-
ball games throughout the 2011 season,
and Filmic hasn't looked back since. Cur-
rently, the group is working on five projects
including videos explaining the University's
budget and a film encouraging students to
explore Ann Arbor.
Buoy noted with pride how Filmic videos
are now shown to students throughout their
collegiate career: when they are admitted,
on Campus Day, at orientation and during
football games.
"It has been the coolest experience to
kind of have a little bit of influence on every
step of those first important moments of the
college career," Buoy said. "For me, it's the
coolest legacy I think we ever could have
left, and we're so thankful to have been able
to do that."

about. Topics varied from BDSM to asexuality to sexual

4B3 The Statement

Wednesday, January 30, 2013 // The Statement 5B

The first time I ever got drunk, I
was a sophomore in high school.
It was 2009 - a pretty indistinct
year with all things considered - except a
new phenomenon was crashing down with a
vengeance on kids my age: the rise of reality
television.
Prime time gems like "Flavor of Love" or
"A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila" peppered
the television lineup like a bad case of her-
pes. Then came "Jersey Shore" - the pen-
ultimate reality television show for getting
plastered, having sex with strangers and
living an entirely irresponsible life ... while
simultaneously becoming famous and get-
ting paid.
These stars were impossible to ignore
- their faces plastered on billboards, com-
mercials and advertisements. So I, much like
every other teenager, investigated what the
hype was all about and eventually bought
into everything the reality TV paradigmhad
to offer.
My friends came over for a sleepover, and
we flipped on a "Jersey Shore" marathon.
After my parents went to sleep upstairs, we
snuck to the back of the living room, quiet-
ly shuffled some potted plants around and
broke into the liquor closet. We mixed some
vodka and orange juice and began to play a
"Jersey Shore" drinking game.
"Every time someone refers to themselves
in third person - drink!"
"Every time someone references gym, tan
or laundry - drink!"
"Every time they have to blur out a body
part - drink!"
By episode three, we were passed out
drunk on the couch. The next day we awoke
with killer hangovers and the vodka safely
back in the cabinet half filled with water
(sorry, Mom and Dad).
In my young mind, drinking and real-
ity shows like "Jersey Shore" seemed to go
hand-in-hand. I thought getting wasted,
dressing awfully and making altogether
bad life choices like Snooki and the Shore
gang made them seem "cool." And what kid
doesn't want to be cool?
It's easy to write off this kind of anecdote
as teen stupidity. That was "so high school"
- after graduation, students receive the gift
of maturity along with their diplomas. But
the effects of reality shows have a tendency
to burrow much deeper than one drunken
sleepover. They can alter perception of
what is right and wrong and can perpetuate
drinking, drugs and sex throughout genera-
tions.
Communications Prof. Susan Douglas
teaches a course that analyzes the effects of
reality shows like "Jersey Shore."
"Let's say you're thirteen and watch-
ing 'Jersey Shore' at night," Douglas said.
"You're seeing all of this behavior, and these
people that are famous because of this show,
which can provide aspirational representa-
tions. You want to aspire to these behaviors
with the goal of becoming famous."
The result: you aspire to these behaviors
with hopes of becoming famous.
Even for students in college, the idea of
being on a realitytelevision show can persist

as a last resort. LSA sophomore Mackenzie
DeWitt sometimes jokes with friends about
how she plans to be on "The Bachelorette."
"When your life turns to complete crap,
it's always a viable option to go on TV and,
make a fool out of yourself," she said. "If we
can't become professionals, we can always
become reality TV stars!"
One of the largest dangers of these shows
is the overwhelming glorification of drink-
ing and party lifestyle: Entire populations of
young adults can have a similar experience
to my own in high school.
"Shows like 'Jersey Shore' totally normal-
ize binge drinking," Douglas said. "They go
out every night and drink massive amounts
of alcohol until they have something that
really resembles alcohol poisoning, which
is harmful. We do know that binge drinking
- unlike social drinking - is a problem on
campuses including ours because it is a dan-
gerous health behavior."
DeWitt echoed Douglas's sentiments from
her own experience on campus.
"It seems as though students assume the
more they drink, the more it will be like it
"A BC claims that t
vivacityt."s th
e ondrinkn but in my1
becu eset as we
sameway me cote
doesn't mean either
- Commu cations Pro
is on television," DeWitt said. "They search
for that level of excitement and drama and
vivacity."
Reality shows don't only perpetuate an
emphasis on drinking in viewers, but they
also heavily encourage it on set as well. Emo-
tionally dramatic shows like "The Bachelor"
amp up the alcouae ontent'to make contes-
tants irrationally emotive.
When the women go to the Bachelor
house there's often no food, only alcohol.
Producers supply them. with wine, and if
that isn't enough to create drama, they crack
open the vodka, a fact that Douglas teaches
in her introductory communications course.
The cast is encouraged to engage in drunken
conduct, a behavior that is then transferred
to TV viewers regardless of age.
"I think reality television portrays drink-
ing as something fun that has little to no
consequences," DeWitt said. "It sensation-
alizes drinking because it shows these huge
parties that are exciting and colorful and
people meeting other people ....- and that's

really not how it is at afrat p,
ple."
Reality television can also
