The Michigan Athletic Department is in the
early planning stages of hosting an outdoor
hockey game in Michigan Stadium, officials
said yesterday.
The game is planned for Dec. 11, 2010, Matt
Trevor, the, Michigan hockey team's Sports
Information Director, said in a phone interview
yesterday.
Early yesterday afternoon, Athletic Depart-
ment officials contacted Michigan State offi-
cials about playing a game in Michigan Stadium.
The stadium, which is currently undergoing a
3-year, $226 million renovation, is scheduled to
be completed by August 2010.
"They're intrigued," Trevor said. "The
planned opponent at this point is Michigan
State, through an expressed interest in favor
of playing an outdoor game at Michigan Sta-
dium."

GIVING IN A DOWN ECONOMY
Some delay
donations in
bad economy

As crisis worsens,
some donors ask to
fulfill their donations
over a longer time .
By DANIEL STRAUSS
Daily StaffReporter
While the full impact of the eco-
nomic downturn is still unclear,
the University is starting to see a
decrease in immediate payments
by donors who have pledged money
to Michigan.
Accordingto University officials,
the economic downturn hasn't
forced donors to go back on their
pledges, but many are taking more
time to pay their pledged amounts.
With donations stretched over lon-
ger periods of time, the University
may have to modify some programs
because funding that was thought
to be available for this year may not
be available until later.
This comes at the same time that
the total amount of money donated
to the University has declined along
with the University's endowment.
But Vice President for Devel-

opment Jerry May said the vast
majority of donors are fulfilling
their pledges as if the economy
were perfectly healthy.
"Eighty-five percent of the cash-
pledged goals have been paid,"
May said. "We've got a little over
$300 million unpaid that people are
making pledged payments on. We
are only about 4 percent behind in
terms of people's pledge payments,
so 96 percent of people are paying
their pledges on time."
But May added that though few
donors have canceled their pledg-
es, there are some donors who
have extended the period in which
they make payments to fulfill their
pledged donations.
"No one has canceled their
pledge," May said. "No one has said
'I pledged $100,000 in the cam-
paign but I'm giving you $20,000
but I can't give you any more,"'
"What we do have is some anec-
dotal information that a handful of
people - oh, let's say 10 to 15 - that
say 'what I need to do is elongate
my pledge, so I was going to pay
it over the next three years, I now
need to extend that to the next
five,"' he said.

FINANCING YOUR EDUCATION
Granhoim pitches
cut to need-based
scholarships

From the Editor: On plagiarism

Plan would trim
need-based funds
by 5.8 percent, boost
merit-based monies
By MALLORY JONES
For the Daily
Balancing the need to keep
dealing with the task of keeping
college affordable in the wors-
ening Michigan economy, Gov.
Jennifer Granholm's new bud-
get proposal calls for a funding
increase of $59.5 million to the
Michigan Promise Grant, a merit-
based scholarship program that
gives students up to $4,000 to
help pay for college tuition.
The proposed budget also
includes combining multiple
existing. need-based programs
into one fund, called the Michi-
gan College Access Grants. Over-
all, need-based programs would
take an $18.8 million funding cut,
or 5.8 percent, if this action were

to be enacted.
While the proposal reduces
funding to need-based programs,
the budget proposal would make
more students eligible for fund-
ing, according to Tiffany Brown,
a spokesperson for Granholm's
office.
She said that with the new
Michigan College Access Grant
fund, students who were not pre-
viously able to get money from
the earlier programs will now
have the opportunity to qualify
for state aid.
"We are tryingto streamline to
make need available to more stu-
dents," Brown said.
At the University of Michigan,
in the 2007-2008 school year
3,152 students received a total of
$3,155,000 from the Michigan
Promise Grants program, accord-
ing to Pam Fowler, executive
director of the University's Office
of Financial Aid.
Granholm's proposed budget
would raise statewide funding for
Michigan Promise from $80.5 mil-

Powwow won't return to Criler Arena next year
Citing too much University

For the Daily
The Ann Arbor Dance for Mother Earth
Powwow, which has been a University tradi-
tion since 1972, will be held outside of Ann
Arbor for the first time in almost 20 years.
Each April, Native Americans nationwide
gather alongside University students and Ann
Arbor community members to kick off the
national powwow season with the Dance for
Mother Earth Powwow.
After refusing direct funding from the Uni-
versity, the Native American Student Associa-

Army National Guard facilities,
improve water and sewer systems
and boost public housing.
Projects announced yester-
day include $7.85 million to make
upgrades at Camp Grayling, Fort
Custer in Augusta and a reserve
forces support center in Lansing.
Gov. Jennifer Granholm also
said some communities that sub-
mitted proposals for drinking
water and sewer system upgrades
last spring and summer will be
among the first eligihle for stimu-
lus caslf.
The stimulus package could pro-
vide $168.5 million for sewer proj-
ects and $67.5 million for drinking
water upgrades this year.
Projects in Benton Harbor, Big

Port Huron, Macomb County and

those likely to be funded first.

Senate Democrats
preserve pet projects
Senate Democrats yesterday
preserved pet projects sought by a
lobbying firm under federal inves-
tigation and tried to nail down
support for big domestic spend-
ing increases in hopes of passing
a wrap-up budget bill by week's
end.
Democrats defeated, by a 52-43
vote, an amendment to strip 13
projects that the PMA Group has
pressed for. The firm, now dis-
banded, is accused of illegally using
straw donors to filnnel campaign
cash to lawmakers.
At the same time, Democrats
sought a few GOP votes for the
$410 billion bill after two Demo-
crats came out against it over the
cost and two more threatened to
withhold support over changes in
U.S. policy toward Cuba.
Democrats and their allies con-
trol 58 seats in the Senate, but 60
votes will be needed to close debate
and free the measure so President
Barack Obama can sign it. Demo-
crats probably will need votes from
perhaps five or six Republicans if
the measure is to pass Thursday
night or Friday.

Ford to cut $10B
in debt with cash,
equity offer
Ford Motor Co. took another
step yesterday to stay cost-com-
petitive with government-financed
automakers General Motors
and Chrysler when it offered to
exchange up to 40 percent of its
debt for cash and stock.
The company and its financial
arm are putting up $2.2 billion in
cash to entice holders of $10.4 bil-
lion in convertible notes, other
unsecured debt and secured term

debt to take the offer. The company
said reducing the debt will cut the
amount it pays in interest and put it
in better position to compete with
General Motors Corp. and Chrysler
LLC.
"This is all part of a restruc-
turing plan to make the company
healthier in the end," said Ford
spokesman Mark Truby. f

Sudanese president faces charges

Omar al-Bashir
indicted for war
crimes and crimes
against humanity
THE HAGUE, Netherlands
(AP) - The president of Sudan
became a wanted man yesterday
when the International Crimi-
nal Court charged him with
war crimes and crimes against
humanity in Darfur - its first
action against a sitting head of
state and one that could set the
stage for more world leaders to
be indicted.

President Omar al-Bashir's gov-
ernment retaliated by expelling 10
humanitarian groups from Darfur
and seizing their assets, threaten-
ing lifesaving operations, a U.N.
spokeswoman said.
Susan Rice, the U.S. ambas-
sador to the United Nations, said
the United States supported the
court's action "to hold account-
able those who are responsible for
the heinous crimes in Darfur." Up
to 300,000 people have died and
2.7 million have fled their homes
in the region.
U.N. officials in Sudan will
continue to deal with al-Bashir
because he remains the president
of the country, U.N. spokeswom-

an Michele Montas said in New
York.
Inthe Sudanese capital of Khar-
toum, the government denounced
the warrant as part of a Western
conspiracy aimed at destabilizing
the vast oil-rich nation south of
Egypt. "There will be no recogni-
tion of or dealing with the white
man's court, which has no man-
date in Sudan or against any of its
people," the Information Ministry
said.
Several thousand people wav-
ing pictures of al-Bashir and
denouncing the court turned
out in a rally in Khartoum. Some
waved posters of chief prosecutor
Luis Morena Ocampo's face with

pig ears superimposed to chants
of, "Cowardly pig, you will not get
to the Sudan."
Al-Bashir, who denies the accu-
sations, drove through the capital
after the warrant was announced,
waving at crowds. Security was
tightened at many embassies, and
some diplomats and aid workers
stayed home amid fears of retali-
ation against Westerners.
The decision by the court lays
the groundwork for potential
indictments of otherheads of state
who have been mentioned as pos-
sible targets of war crimes investi-
gations, including leaders of other
African nations and Israel.
"Head of state immunity no lon-

ger is a bar to prosecuting heads of
state who commit war crimes and
crimes against humanity during
their time in office," said David
Crane, an international law pro-
fessor at Syracuse University.and
former prosecutor of the Sierra
Leone tribunal that indicted Libe-
rian President Charles Taylor and
put him on trial in The Hague.
Slobodan Milosevic was indicted
while still president of Yugoslavia
in 1999 by the tribunal for the for-
mer Yugoslavia.
Both Milosevic and Taylor were
indicted by temporary courts.
yesterday's ruling is significant
because the International Crimi-
nal Court is permanent.

Detroit mayor vetoes city Rove, Miers to testify

council's vote on Cobo

in prosecutor tirings

Cockrel confident he
has the authority to
veto council's vote
DETROIT (AP) - Mayor Ken
Cockrel Jr. yesterday followed
through on his promise to veto
the Detroit City Council's 5-3 vote
shooting down a deal to turn Cobo
Center over to a regional authority.
Flanked by about two dozen
members of local unions, Cockrel
said he is confident Detroit's city
charter gives him the authority to
veto the council's action.
"I believe we're on solid legal
ground and I took this action today
with that understanding," he said
yesterday afternoon inside the
downtown convention center.
Council President Monica Cony-
ers has vowed to take the matter
to court if there is a veto. She says
the city would not get an adequate
return on its investment in Cobo
under the plan.
Conyers told reporters during
a late afternoon news conference
that the Council would review its
options, but "we don't need to over-
ride, because he doesn't have the
authority to veto it."
"Ifhe wants acourtbattle, I guess
we'll have a court battle."
Six of nine votes normally would
be needed' to override a mayoral
veto,but the councilis downto eight
members with Cockrel's ascension

Former Bush aides
agree to testify
about the firings of
U.S. attorneys
WASHINGTON (AP) - Former
top Bush aides Karl Rove and Har-
riet Miers agreed yesterday to tes-
tify before Congress under oath
about the firings of U.S. attorneys,
a controversy involving allega-
tions of political interference that
grew into a constitutional stand-
off between two branches of gov-
ernment.
The Bush White House had
fought attempts to force Rove
and Miers to testify, and the
agreement - steered by aides to
President Barack Obama - ended
that dispute. Both the White
House and lawmakers, especially
now that Democrat ObamA has
replaced Republican George W.
Bush - were leery of having a
judge settle the question about
the limits of executive privilege,
for fear of losing.
The agreement calls for Rove
and Miers, Bush's top political
adviser and White House counsel,
to be interviewed by the House
Judiciary Committee in closed
depositions "under the penalty

for perjury," said House Judiciary
Committee Chairman John Cony-
ers, D-Mich. The committee says
it also might call the two for public
testimony.
The arrangement ends a law-
suit over whether former White
House aides couldbe forced to tes-
tify about matters on which they
advised the president. Bush had
ordered Wove and Miers not to tes-
tify in the U.S. attorneys investiga-
tion, and the Judiciary Committee
sued a year ago.
Last July, U.S. District Judge
John Bates rejected Bush's con-
tention that senior White House
advisers were immune from the
committee's subpoenas, siding
with Congress' power to inves-
tigate the executive branch. The
Bush administration had appealed
the decision.
Until this dispute, Congress had
never gone to court to demand the
testimony of White House aides.
Bates had suggested that the two
sides settle to avoid a ruling that
would be binding of future presi-
dents and members of Congress.
Justice Department officials
said the committee and the Obama
administration would make i joint
filing to the court asking the judge
to stay the lawsuit over the issue.
If the agreement is breached, the'
case could be revived.

Flanked by about two dozen members of local unions, Detroit Mayor Ken Cockrel
Jr., addresses members of the media yesterday in Detroit.

still is required by council to over-
ride his veto.
It's not clear if any action will be
taken by the council at next Tues-
day's formal session, but for a city
facing a budget deficit that could
approach $300 million justify-
ing a costly court fight could be
difficult.
Inaletterinformingthecoun-
cil Wednesday of the veto, Cock-

rel wrote that the body's own fiscal
analyst issued a report that said the
transfer to an authority would save
Detroit up to $500 million over the
next six years.

Freeing up funding
State should improve probation programs for offenders
M ichigan prisons consume around 90 percent of the state's
corrections spending. Sound excessive? It gets even
worse when one considers that two thirds of the people
who should be benefiting from projects funded by this money aren't
even inside these prisons. With a report released Monday find-
ing that one in every 27 Michigan adults are in jail, on probation
or parole, it's long past time to take a closer look at how the state
spends money on corrections. Michigan lawmakers should invest in
better supervision for offenders to be monitored outside of the jail
cell, not just because it's in their economic best interests to do so but
also because this strategy would emphasize the rehabilitative pur-
pose of the state corrections department.

A movement for liberty

Monday's report by the Pew Center on
the States estimated that there are about 5.1
million people on probation or parole in the
United States - a number that tripled from
1982 to 2007. Including prisoners behind
bars, the number exceeds 7.3 million.
Michigan in particular has the 13th high-
est rate of adults under community super-
vision or behind bars. And while costs for
a prison inmate average nationally around
$29,000, the cost for a parolee or proba-
tioner ranges from only $1,250-$2,250.
Considering Michigan's current economic
troubles, allowing low-risk inmates to take
advantage of correctional probation and
parole programs would be a smart way to
save money.
Due to Michigan's strict release policies,
the state has considerably more people in
prison for longer periods of time. A high rate
of prisoners costs the state more money -
money that could be saved if more prison-
ers were released to community supervision
programs. This saving from downsizingpris-
on spending could be redirected to improve
Michigan's current probation and parole
programs. 'The Michigan Prison Re-Entry
Initiative already has programs in place
designed to help successfully guide prison-
ers back into their communities. The state
can the use money saved to improve these
community supervision strategies through
advances in technology.
By developing better technology for reha-
bilitation programs in the community, such
as electric monitoring and rapid-result drug
and alcohol tests, supervisors can better keep

the offender on the right track. The offend-
ers will also benefit because this gives them
a better opportunity for transitioning back
into society. The greatest returns will come
to the state by implementing programs that
decrease recidivism rates, save money on
prison spending and rehabilitate the inmate
population.
Better technology and programs are mak-
ing it much easier to monitor offenders on
parole. In states like Hawaii, for example,
a focus on the rehabilitation of offenders
in their own communities has proven to be
effective. Participants are offered programs
with extensive counseling and treatment,
and are required to comply with regular drug
tests, office visits and treatment require-
ments. Programs that are more specialized
to the specific needs and interests of the
individual offenders are more likely to be
successful. Michigan correctional programs
should adopt creative programs like this
one that improve the corrections system in
Michigan and save the state money.
Through strengthened and expanded
community supervision strategies and tech-
nologies, the state can achieve long-term
solutions for the well-being of the prisoners
and the economy. It's time to follow the lead
of other states and start reducing both the
money - and the people - funneling into
an outdated prison system. Many of these
prisoners can be safely overseen in their own
communities, working with extensive coun-
seling and treatment through the help of
improved technologies - that will save the.
state money that can be put to better use.

T heFeb. 16 editionofNewsweek
magazine had an interesting
but unsurprising cover story:
"We Are All Social-
ists Now". The
story demonstrat-
ed how the size of
the U.S.'s govern-
ment spending as
a percentage of the
economy is quickly
approaching Euro-
pean levels. Gov-
ernment spending PATRICK
was 34.3 percent of ZABAWA
the country's Gross
Domestic Prod-
uct a decade ago
- it's projected to be 39.9 percent in
2010. But despite Newsweek's argu-
ments that U.S. public policy is shift-
ing toward socialism, there are still
strong contingents of Americans who
are notsocialists. Forone, stronganti-
socialist movements are developing
on campuses across the world. And
Americans' increased opportunity
for choices ensure that their freedom
is increasing even as the government
takes over their banks. Indeed, we
are not all socialists now.
Yes, it's worth noting that Obama,
who favors an interventionist govern-
ment, attracted most of the country's
young voters. For every young adult
who voted for Republican candidate
John McCain on Election Day, two
voted for Obama. But while it may
seem that young voters are becoming
ever more socialist in their views, the
Ron Paul campaign revealed other-
wise. In many states' Republican pri-
mary elections, Paul - who supports
dismantling the federal income tax
and significantly shrinking the size of
government - received from young
voters nearly twice the percentage of
votes than he received from other age
groups. His college-student support
was bolstered by his frequent visits
to university campuses, and he even

spoke at the University of Michigan
while Obama and McCain did not.
But even now that the 2008 pres-
idential election is over and the
energy surrounding the Ron Paul
campaign has diminished, students
around the nation are continuing to
pursue efforts to counter the nation's
socialist policies. Just two weeks
ago, I joined students from college
campuses around the world for the
International Students for Liberty
Conference in Washington, D.C.
The conference, first held last year
by a group of Ivy League students,
brought together student leaders to
hold discussions with prominent pro-
liberty, anti-government advocates.
In just one year, the conference has
expanded to include students from
over a dozen countries outside the
United States.
One of the conference's keynote
speakers, editor in chief of Reason.
com Nick Gillespie, spoke not only
about how anti-government move-
ments are growing but why govern-
ment's growth hasn't prevented the
expansion of freedom. He argued
that despite increasing government
in the economy and our personal
lives, we are more free today than
ever before.
Gillespie's point was thought-
provoking and surprisingly accurate.
Over the past twenty years, the size of
the government has grownto unprec-
edented levels. Even the conservative
Bush administration enacted the
biggest social welfare program ever,
implemented senior prescription
drug coverage and nearly socialized
the banking and mortgage industries.
Government has become increasing-
ly involved in overseas warfare and
now has restricted gay marriage in
29 states.
But despite government's new
involvement in American's personal
and economic lives, Gillespie had a
point when he stated that we are in

fact more free today than we were
twenty years ago. We are more free
because we have more choice. Trav-
el opportunities abound as airlines
travel to nearly every small city in
the United States now, not only large
ones. The advent of personal comput-
ers, the Internet and cell phones has
brought about a new era of commu-
nication. Information is now acces-
sible to people of any educational
background through user-friendly
sources such as Wikipedia.

Why Americans
aren't as socialist
as they may seem.

4

It is the human desire for choice
that has continued to increase its
freedom. Choice has continued to
motivate innovators to make new
products and come up with new ways
for people to communicate. Socially,
more people tbday support the abil-
ity to "choose" to marry a partner
of the same sex or allow women the
right to "choose". Is the similar word
usage coincidental, deliberate or just
inevitable?
So while Newsweek argues that
we are all socialist now, students'
activism and the number of choices
we have today points to the contrary.
Yes, government is gaining more con-
trol of our lives at an alarming rate,
but there are many factors working
against that control. And as anti-
government student groups rise and
innovations continue to develop,
government will have many forces to
reckon with in its quest to limit our
freedoms.

Staying safe at school

I recently "came out of. the closet" and, to
my surprise, the world outside my little cha-
rade hasn't changed much - except for'a newly
found happiness, of course. I made this decision
a little after Christmas and I haven't looked back
since, but I have to admit that the decision itself
was the most difficult one I've ever had to make.
The pressure it presented and the unknown that
waited on the other side wasn't easy to set aside
or overcome. However, coming out has made
my life infinitely better, and other gay teenag-
ers should know that they don't have to live in an
environment that forces them to keep their sexu-
ality secret. I'm saying this in hopes that some-
one, somewhere will be helped by knowing that,
because I understand the fear, pain and doubt
that keepingthis secret creates.
For years, my sexuality was something I didn't
talk about even among my friends, and when the
topic was brought up I would begrudgingly spout
out mumbles, half-truths and lies. It was difficult,
but manageable. How hard is it to lie and say you
had a crush on some random girl from English?
The answer is surprisingly complex. It's both
the easiest and most difficult thing to do. This lie
makes you seem more "normal," but it, also rein-
forces the feelings inside you that you're some-
thing inferior.
I lived knowing that I wasn't being true to
myself I went through the motions of daily life
and kept myself excessively busy with clubs,
sports and organizations, but I knew all along
that it was to stop myself from thinking about the
part of myself I was covering up. It was suffocat-
ing and undeniably painful to lie to the entirety of
my family and friends - every sentence I uttered
needed to be checked and each action analyzed.
The consistent fear that someone would discover
my secret was the worst part. Slipping or making
a mistake was simply not an option.
Despite this dishonesty, I had an amaz-
ing high school experience. I was able to make
friends and form bonds without worrying about
being judged any more than the average teen-
ager. With my busy schedule, I found a love for
writing and athletics and steadily whittled away
the four years. Looking back, I wish I was strong
enough to come out back then because I think

high school would have felt more complete if
everyone knew, but emotionally I wasn't ready to
let everyone know what I had kept hidden since
grade school.
During my first year here at the University,
the strain of retaining my facade started to
become too much. I had trouble sleeping and,
despite the fact I was living away from home, I
still had to watch everything I said. Why could
other people live their lives and be happy, but I
couldn't? I decided to take my life into my own
hands and come out. After a near heart attack, I
was finally able to tell my parents what I wanted
to for years. Without a second's hesitation they
both said that I was their son, and their love for
me would never falter. For me, this was the most
liberating experience of my life, and I am more
than proud to say that I have been supported by
everyone I have told thus far. Ican only wish any
other gay person who makes this decision the
same luck.
The best advice I can give is to make sure
you're ready, because your life will change, hope-
fully it will be for the better, but it will doubtless-
ly change. Some people never tell a soul, others
come out in middle or high school. Others still,
likemyselfwaituntilcollegeandthe"realworld."
But all teenagers struggling with their sexual-
ity should know that you're not alone. Despite
the way you may be feeling right now, you're not.
There are people you can talk to and steps you
can take. If you're not ready to tell your parents
or friends, call a hotline and talk about it. Maybe
there is one person you feel comfortable with: tell
them. The University offers help as well, and the
Spectrum Center exists for just this reason. The
center has a coming-out support program and
people are there just waitingto help you.
Instead of feeling isolated and weak, feel strong
- the first step is knowing you have options. I've
lived through my personal Dark Ages and I'm
stronger for it. I hope reading this helps at least
one person, because if it does, telling my story
was worth it. I'm gay: who cares? If you're gay
too, stand and be proud.

Lebler's odd secret to success .
Unconventional of his life. He has set career highs
offseason workout for goals (eight) and assists (seven).
After a choppy first half, the junior

and contributed significantly on theaB ighe n s

By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Daily Sports Editor
This summer, Michigan hockey
junior forward Brian Lebler used
some strange workout equipment.
"We had big monster truck tires,
and outside we had big sledgeham-
mers and stuff, and we just kind of
pushed stuff (and) ran," said Leb-
ler, who has scored six goals in the
second half of the season. "We just
did a different workout everyday
pretty much."
Lebler, afBritishColumbianative,
while working out this summer in
his backyard, followed an unortho-
dox training plan.
For cardio, Lebler and a friend
of his who plays hockey at Mercy-
hurst would run to a lake 20 to 25
minutes, away. They would then
swim for 15 minutes before jog-
ging back to Lebler's house. After
lunch, the two would weightlift
by flipping tires and racing with
them.
"(We would) just do something
different, so it's a little more fun
and easier to work hard," Lebler
said.
And it paid off. Lebler, who's
listed at 210 pounds, returned to
Michigan last fall in the best shape

just six tallies all of last season.
"On his behalf, he had to take a
step," Michigan coach Red Beren-
son said. "He's a junior. He really
hadn't done anything. He'd been
consistently average or below aver-
age.
"He has to watch his weight.
He has to watch what he eats. He
has to work harder than the aver-
age player just to keep up. So he
made a commitment this summer,
which was good. That's a sign of
maturity and a sign of a real, 'Hey,
this is serious. If I'm going to get
any better, if I'm going to play at
all at Michigan, I better do what I
can do in the summer to be more
ready.' "
This is the first time Michigan
has seen Lebler clicking on the ice.
Last season, he was scratched for
14 of the Wolverines' 43 games,
including the CCHA Champion-
ship game and the entire NCAA
Tournament.
Berenson said the scratches may
have been due to Lebler's "heavy"
skating and lack of quickness. The
junior has always been one of the
Wolverines' more physical players,
but playing at a weight of well over
200 pounds while his faster team-
mates played at around 180 pounds
certainly impacted his production..

top players

SAID ALSALAH/Daily
Junior Brian Lebler has a career-high number of both goals and assists this season.

"The (first) couple falls, he was
in okay shape, but this time he came
in real good shape," Michigan asso-
ciate head coach Mel Pearson said.
"He really made a concentrated
effort to get leaner, shape his bodya
little bit more, get in better shape."
Lebler took the big step over
the summer, but it wasn't until the
Great Lakes Invitational in late
December that it started to show.
With sophomore forward Aaron
Palushaj playing at the World
Junior Championships, Lebler got
the chance to play on the first line
alongside offensive playmakers

Louie Caporusso and David Wohl-
berg.
The line exploded, posting four
goals, and Lebler returned with
confidence in the second half.
Now, Lebler's adding to Michi-
gan's biggest strength - its deep
offense, in which all four lines
regularly contribute to the score-
board.
"Definitely in the second half,
I think he's got a little bit better
role on the team now, and you see
that," Pearson said. "What he did
last summer is starting to show up
now."

Daily Sports Writer
The Big Ten Network will
release its men's basketball All-Big
Ten team Monday. But instead of
waiting four more days, here's a
sneak preview of the likely group.
Hint: It's'an all-sophomore roster.
FORWARD EVAN TURNER,
OHIO STATE
Also my pick for Big Ten Player
of the Year, Turner is as versatile
as they come. He leads Ohio State
in scoring, rebounding and assists.
He's the Big Ten's leading scorer in
conference play and has six dou-
ble-doubles on the year.
But it's Turner's efficiency that
makes him so dangerous. The
sophomore shoots 51 percent from
the field, including 45 percent
from behind the are.
How valuable is he to Ohio
State? The 6-foot-7 Turner fills
the middle position in the Buck-
eye's 2-3 zone, which is usually
occupied by a team's tallest player.
Because of his length and athleti-
cism, Turner wreaks havoc on the
defensive end. He is the glue that
has kept Ohio State on the NCAA
Tournament bubble and he's the
best player in the conference.
FORWARD MANNY HARRIS,
MICHIGAN
Another no-brainer. Michigan
coach John Beilein asked Harris
this season to be more of a com-
plete player, and Harris has deliv-
ered. He has 86 more rebounds
and 44 more assists than at this
point last year. And unlike his first
season, he'll end the season with a
positive assist-to-turnover ratio.
Inconsistency is Harris's lone
weakness. He scored in single dig-
its three times in a crucial four-
game stretch for the Wolverines,
and he scored just nine points in a
heartbreaking loss at Iowa on Feb.
22.
But Harris has played the role
of Superman more than once. He
willed Michigan to victory against
Northwestern on Feb. 15 when he
scored 25 second-half and over-
time points, and he scored 27 while
looking unstoppable in an 87-78

upset of Purdue on Feb. 26.
GUARD KALIN LUCAS,
MICHIGAN STATE
Lucas is the best player on the
eighth-ranked Spartans, the best
team in the Big Ten. The point
guard has flourished in conference
play, averaging 16.2 points.
But the most impressive part of
Lucas's game is his ability to take
care of the ball (134 assists to just
55 turnovers).
ESPN.com senior college bas-
ketball writer Andy Katz wrote in
January: "If Lucas can be a deci-
sion-maker, a decisive presence
for the Spartans, then they have
a chance to win the Big Ten and
reach their ultimate goal: getting
to (the Final Four)."
Lucas has done just that, and
Michigan State is certainly on the
right path to playing in the final
game of the season.
GUARD TALOR BATTLE,
PENN STATE
Despite standing just 5-foot-
11, Battle averages more than five
rebounds per game. Along with 17
points and five assists on average
per game, Battle has emerged as
one of the top two point guards in
the Big Ten. And his 2.2:1 assist-
to-turnover ratio has helped Penn
State turn around from a medio-
cre Big Ten program to a possible-
NCAA Tournament team.
And Battle has shown up in big
games. In Penn State's big wins
over Purdue and Michigan State,
Battle posted 21 and 29 points,
respectively.
CENTER JAJUAN JOHNSON,
PURDUE
This was the toughest pick.
Michigan junior DeShawn Sims,
Northwestern's Kevin Coble and
Penn State's Jamelle Cornley were
also in the running, but at the end
of the day, it's likely the second-
best team in the Big Ten will have
someone on this list. Johnson has
anchored Purdue's tough defense
with 2.2 blocks per game. His
6-foot-10 frame and. long arms
make him a force on the offensive
end as well, where he has nine
16-point or better performances.

what Izzo did, didn't he?" 60-50 on Jan.
's Spartans won the men's 22.
--season conference title, Borseth said it's a disadvantage
-seth's squad has further to for both teams to face each other
d sophomore guard Veron- so soon after their last matchup.
ks isn't buying her coach's He emphasized that the Wolver-
e. ines, even though they are in last
n't think he's far from that place, can compete with any team

in the.Big Ten.
Michigan (3-15, 10-19) has
maintained a positive attitude
throughout a tough conference
season'.Of its 15 conference losses,
just four have been by more than
10 points. And three of those four
have come at the hands of each of
the top three seeds in the tourna-
ment: Ohio State, Michigan State
and Purdue.
"As the year has progressed, the
sense of urgency really has height-
ened," Borseth said.
But that urgency he talked
about hasn't resulted in victories.
The Wolverines will need four
wins to secure a new haircut for
Borseth. If Michigan wins the
tournament, it will automatically
receive a bid to the NCAA Tourna-
ment. But the Wolverines haven't
won four consecutive games all
season. Their longest win streak is
three games, and it has only hap-
pened once this season. To make
matters worse, Michigan is 2-12
away from Crisler Arena this sea-
son and 1-0 on neutral courts.

For the Wolverines to fix their
issues for the Big Ten Tourna-
ment, they will have to close out
games, which has been a problem
all season long.
"Just keep going hard all
throughout the game," senior
guard Jessica Minnfield said. "We
can't let down, not one possession.
We just got to keep playing each
possession like it's oar last." -
Hicks echoed Minnfield's senti-
ments but also said the team's cur-
rent confidence level is in a state
of flux.
"I think that we have a confi-
dence level that has been consis-
tent with what we've been having
all year," Hicks said. "But it could
be higher. Clearly the losses that
we had mean something, because
you have to find a way to win.
"When you're winning consis-
tently, it's almost expected. When
you start losing consistently, that
almost becomes habitual, too. So
I think that it's just finding a way
to turn it around and get used to
winning."

DONORS
From Page 1A
When asked if these delays will
affect University programs, Judith
Malcolm, the director of communi-
cations and donor relations for the
University's Office of Development,
said because donors are extending
their payment times, the University
now has less money to set aside for
programs originally expected to
receive more money sooner.
If they were putting this into a
scholarship account, it means there
will be less money there earning
interest," Malcolm said. "If their
gift was to be spent now, yes it does
mean there's less money to be spent
so if they were funding a scholarship
there is less money for the students."
The total donations to the Uni-
versity between the 2007-2008 fis-
cal year and the 2008-2009 year
have declined from $184,214,257 to

$155,191,066 according to the Uni-
versity Board of Regents website.
University officials acknowledge
that a small part of this decline is
because of the economic downturn.
The donations total isn't likely to
increase anytime soon, May said. He
predictsothat in the coming months, as
the University further feels the impact
of the financial crisis, getting new
donations willbecome more difficult.
"I think new commitments are
going to be harder to get," May said.
"We've just gone through a tremen-
dous period in the last eight years of
this campaign where we had a cam-
paign,andthatwasthethingthatwas
really positive. Now we don't have
a campaign, we have what we call
regular fundraising, so there's not the
same sense of deadline, if you will."
The downturn comes onthe heels
of the University's record-setting
Michigan Difference Campaign,
which raised $3.2 billion since it
became public in 2004.

State officials hope
to learn from Danish
green economy
By MALLORY JONES
For the Daily
Gov. Jennifer Granholm will
meet with members of the Danish
Royal Embassy on campus today to
discuss the first leg in their part-
nership to address the prospect of
an environmentally sustainable
economy in Michigan and across.
the United States.
The Climate Group, an interna-
tional nongovernmental organiza-
tion that works with businesses and
governments to stop climate change,
willfacilitatethe partnership,which
POWWOW
From Page1A
Rackham Graduate School stu-
dent Conner Sandefur, a member
of NASA, said the move reflects
NASA's, desire to redirect the
powwow's management away
from the University's Office of
Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs and
back to the Native American com-
munity.
Sandefur said that while MESA
has done a great job planning the
event in the past, the red tape of
University bureaucracies do not
allow Native American students to
have as much direct involvement
with the Native American commu-
nity as they would like.
"We are taking back our central
control of the powwow to honor
our community," he said. "One

is meant to help create jobs in the.
field of sustainable energy.
Allison Hannon, Midwest
regional manager for The Climate
Group, said the event, which will
take place in the Michigan League,
will "maintain a dialogue" between
the two governments.
"We're bringing the .Danish
minister, sort of the European
experience, over to Michigan and
to the Midwest where we're try-
ing out figure out 'how we really
do address climate change in the
U.S.," Hannon said.
The event, titled "Switching
Gears," will include two panel dis-
cussions with Michigan business
leaders, including representatives
from Ford Motor- Co. and Whirl-
pool Corp., said Andrew Hoffman,
a professor in the School of Natural
of the great things that have hap-
pened this year is we have been
able to connect with the greater
community. Native American stu-
dents get to meet elders who feel
comfortable coming because it's
not within the confinements of the
University setting."
Amer Ahmed, associate direc-
tor of the Office of Multi-Eth-
nit Student Affairs, told the
Ann Arbor News yesterday that
the University will respect the
group's decision to relocate the
powwow.
"The University of Michigan
has been proud to support the Ann
Arbor Powwow in whatever capac-
ity the community felt comfortable
with," he told the News.
Ojibwe Lecturer Howard Kime-,
won, who has attended the pow-
wow in the past, said he hopes that
the move will bring back traditions

Resources and Environment and
the Ross School of Business.
Sen.Debbie Stabenow(D-Mich.)
will speak via video, and Granholm
will speak in person and sign an
agreementwithConnieHedegaard,
the Danish Minister for Climate
and Energy, officially cementing
the collaboration between Michi-
gan and Denmark.
Hannon said the Danish gov-
ernment officials chose to partner
with Michigan because they want-
ed to work with a part of the Unit-
ed States where sustainable energy
would have a large impact.
"With Gov. Granholm being the
chair of the Midwest Governors
Association and talking aboutgreen
jobs and green manufacturing and
a new energy economy this seems
like really one of the most logical
that have been absent in the past.
"I think that people are start-
ing to wake up now," he said. "Last
year, tradition wasn't there at all, it
was all governed by the University
of Michigan."
Sandefur also said one of the
major reasons for the move is the
controversy surrounding about
1,900 Native American remains
currently located in the Universi-
ty's Museum of Anthropology.
University officials maintain
that they can't turn over any of the
artifacts because the Native Amer-
ican Graves Protection and Repa-
triation Act requires them to keep
all artifacts that are not considered
"culturally identifiable." But last
March, members of the Saginaw
Chippewa tribe asked the Univer-
sity to return culturally identifi-
able objects, of which they claim
ownership.

places to engage," Hannon said.
Hannon said Hedegaard and
others will be able to provide
Michigan officials with advice
on dealing with climate change
because Denmark has a wide vari-
ety of experience in sustainable
energy.
It is the home of one of the
largest wind manufacturing com-
panies in the world and is a par-
ticipant in the European Union
Emissions Trading Scheme, which
puts a price on carbon emissions.
Haanon added that Denmark is
a leader in sustainable technolo-
gies and will even host a meeting
of the Conference of the Parties
- the highest meeting body of the
United Nations Framework Con-
vention on Climate Change - in
December.
Sandefur said one of the reasons
NASA is relocating the powwow is
because the remains have yet to be
returned.
"(We are making) a statement
that this is a wrong thing and that
Michigan is supposed to be the
leaders and the best," Sandefur
said. "Let's be a leader and return
the remains."
Kimewon said he thinks the
remains should no longer be
housed at the University,
"I strongly believe that native
human remains should go where
they belong in the Earth and finish
their journey," he said.
Though the powwow won't be at
its usual home this year, Sandefur
expects that the attendance rate
will remain high. He added that
they will be offering free shuttles
from the Michigan Union to Saline
Middle School.
HOCKEY
From Page 1A
tor John Lewandowski refused to
confirm yesterday that plans for a
game at the Big Mouse were in the
works, according to the Lansing
State Journal.
In 2001, the two in-state rivals
met at Spartan Stadium in front
of more than 74,000 people in a
game dubbed the Cold War. The
game ended in a 3-3 tie. Rumors of
a rematch in the Big House have
been passed around, but talks have
never beenas serious as now.
Trevor also said that the Michigan
vs. Wisconsin outdoor hockey game
at Camp Randall Stadium scheduled
for Feb.'6, 2010 would be confirmed
by the University of Wisconsin Ath-
letic Departmentlater this week.
Trevor stressed that planning
for the game at the Big House is in
the most preliminary stages, but
said "it's definitely planned. People
want to do it and everyone's behind
it - it's a matter of moving forward
and figuring out how."
"There's still a lot to be decided,"
he said. "We have to decide what
time the game will be, how much
tickets will be, what companies can
provide the outdoor ice.
"We'll contact the NHL and see
how the Blackhawks did it, and talk
to the people that did the Cold War
game at Michigan State back it
2001," he said. "And then we'll see
how the Badgers do it next year."
Trevor also said that packaging
the game with an NHL matchup is
not out of the question, since the
production of the game is still in its
early stages.

"People are always saying, 'Oh,
the Red Wings should play a game
at the Big House,' " Trevor said.
"We definitely want to do it ... but
there's a lot of stuff that we would
have to go through."

STUDENTS IN THE CYPHER REACH FOR AUTHENTICITY
WITH THEIR COMMITMENT TO FREESTYLE RAPPING
BY RHIANNON HALLER I DAILY ARTS WRITER

IT'S AROUND 9 p.m. on a
Tuesday in East Quad's Abeng
Multicultural Lounge. A few
students sit in comfy armchairs7
listening to hip-hop beats, recit- de
ing poems to each other and spt
discussing a mixtape they plan it i
on recording. Kinesiology senior spa
Walt Lacey begins freestyling co
and the people around him begin
to clap. As the clapping gets st
louder, the energy in the room in
builds. People cheer in response .m
to certain lines and jeer at others; a
a few guys start dancing and the ti
beat gets more complicated as The tc
Cypher's Tuesday meeting comes s
into full swing.o
After a few minutes of one or h
two people rapping, everybody 1
joins in with a chorus of "Tell them1
to get back!" The flowing energy1
continues, and then the group qui-
ets down as a female voice comes
in, humming softly while gradu-
ally getting louder. People begin
rak in over her takin turns and

The Cypher is a hip-hop collective
dicated to perfecting the art of both
oken and written word. Lacey founded
n 2004 when he saw the need for a safe
ace for Michigan's student hip-hop
mmunity to practice its work.
About 15 minutes pass, and the free-
tyle circle - or "cypher," as it's known
the hip-hop com-
unity - breaks. After
few minutes of chat- FINDING
ing, Lacey walks up
oa .chalkboard and IN THE
crawls a few wordsh
on it: passion, legacy, TO CREA
heart, love, struggle,
life, movement, hip RHYThM
hop, music, rhythm,
bass and soul. These
words act as prompts for a free-writ-
ing exercise, which concludes The
Cypher meeting.
Engineering freshman Alex
Wyszewianski and LSA junior Isaac
Boachie-Ansah are two regular
Cypher attendees. Wyszewian-
ski heard about The Cypher when
he went to a freestyling event on
the Diag during Welcome Week.
Boachie-Ansah discovered The
Cypher by randomly running into
a group of people freestyling on the
Diag during his sophomore year.
For him, attending Cypher meet-
ings was originally just a creative
outlet. But now .it has become
something more.
"The Cypher became a family

for me," he said.
Though The Cypher's members all
joined the group for differentreasons,
it's clear that they're held together by
a common thread: a love for hip hop.
"It's what I was raised on," says
Boachie-Ansah.

and didn't become

Wyszewianski views hip hop as a
tool to further a social agenda. He says
that hip-hop artists not only express
their opinions, but also tell people
what they think should be done to
effect change.
"A lot of other music doesn't have
this," he explained.
The kind of hip hop the members
of The Cypher are talking about, they
insist, isn't the kind students dance
to at college parties. Wyszewianski
explains that there are four elements

Food gets political

Med school smokers

recent debate with a vegan con-.
vinced me that I haven't been eating
enough red meat.
Last summer, on a quest to better under-
stand the.fast food and
meat-packing industries,
I read Eric Schlosser's
"Fast Food Nation." The
book chronicled the rise of
the fast food system, from
its humble beginnings
as an innovative restau-
rant style to the world- KARA
enveloping industry it is MORRIS
today. Since then, I've had
trouble purchasing meat from supermarkets
without understanding its origin. I've been
interested in - and terrified by - the world
of food politics.
"Food politics?" Stand aside, restaurant
critics; there's food news to be told.
Wonder why consumers weren't imme-
diately notified when the peanut butter
supply went awry? Is there merit to organ-
ics besides the higher price tag? And why
the heck were strains of E. coli found in
raw spinach? Welcome to the world of food
politics.
Before reading Schlosser's novel, I held a
fairly stereotypical view of vegans and vege-
tarians. I thought of them as do-gooder ani-
mal lovers and PETA activists who wouldn't
eat meat because they couldn't condone the
killing of an innocent animal. I had also.
heard stories of vegans who were purists
and didn't want to put anything but untaint-
ed fruits, veggies and grains into their bod-
ies. Others, I had been told, decided to forgo
meat for religious reasons.A friend of mine,
meanwhile, complained that vegans held
themselves morally superior for their pro-
animal choices.
While some vegans fit these claims, there
is an entirely different point of view of veg-
4nism concerned with environmental issues,
America's overconsumption, worker's rights
and consumer health.
In short, environmental issues concern
the state of the land and animals. As the fast
food industry has grown, early "home-on-
the-range" farms have given way to larger
factory farms. More similar to chemical
processing plants than grazing pastures,
these "farms" have been known for raising
animals in tight, uncomfortable conditions
before sending them to slaughterhouses.
Aside from the strain put on the ani-
mals, the factories and the transportation
involved in connecting them have had
increasingly negative effects on the environ-
ment as the popularity of meat has grown.
Factory-farmed animals are often raised on
grain. Instead of the animals roaming for
food, energy must be put into growing and
harvesting their grain.
Another problem vegans and vegetar-
ians try to combat is the overconsumption
of meat products. Where we once sat down
to one serving of meat or fish per day, facets
of our culture have encouraged larger por-
tions, like 12-ounce rib-eye steaks. We've
also been encouraged to dine on meat more

frequently. McDonald's thinks it can sell us a
chicken biscuit sandwich for breakfast, and
apparently it can.
Still, others are concerned with workers'
rights. If you've ever read an excerpt from
Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle," you'll know
about the calamities involved in the meat-
packing business. There's an entirely differ-
ent debate concerningminimum wage pay
and the mishandling of unions by the fast
food industry.
Finally, some consumers are just genu-
inely concerned about well-being. They are
worried about the health of animals raised
conventionally in Concentrated Animal
Feeding Operations (CAFOs). Animals
raised in CAFOs are under more stress and
thus more susceptible to disease. Some fac-
tory farms have been known to supplement
their animals' diets collectively with growth
hormones and antibiotics. This raises even
more debates; what effect do the hormones
have on our bodies-and what happens when
bacteria become resistant to the antibiotics?
These views could not exist without
attention to the other side of the vegan/veg-
etarian debate. Is it even sustainable to move
from conventional farming back to individu-
al farms? How much would the price of food
rise? Never mind the price of food; would
Not all vegans are
self-righteous hippies.
we even be able to produce enough food to
feedl ourselves? And are CAFOs really a bad
thing? It isn't easy to get those beautifully
marbled cuts of meat from muscular animals
that have been able to run freely.
No debate is without its quirks. One good
example is PETA's recent suggestion to Ben
and Jerry's to use human breast milk in
their ice cream, claiming, "breast is best!"
So when you feel like scoffing at someone
who says "No thanks, I'm a vegetarian," con-
sider their motivations - are they shallowly
concerned or do they have substantial rea-
sons for passing on that succulent meat dish?
In the world of food politics, this is only
the meat argument. Other debates arise -
concerning the disputed health benefits of
organics, community supported agriculture
and the weaknesses of the FDA.
It's also interesting to look at the com-
bination of Washington politics and food
politics. Recently, famed Chez Panisse's
chef Alice Waters has made strides with the
Obama household, making suggestions for a
vegetable garden on-site at the White House.
And don't think the local farmers market
is without its politics. Although it generally
conveys a strong farm-to-table sentiment,
some farmers have come under fire for gar-
nering one too many tables on market days.

Hilarity ensues," Co-director
and fourth year med student
Tom Scott-Craig said.
Although the movie being
parodied isn't a musical, the
Galens script includes sev-
eral "spoof songs" like "Dots
Just Want to Have Fun" and
an old school rap by the lead-
ing character. The songs also
include dances, which are part
of annual traditions like the
"Babe Dance" and the "Stud
Dance" typically performed
by senior students.
"The latter is basically
a bunch of guys bumbling
through a choreographed
dance," Scott-Craig said. "And
then we take our shirts off."
The content of this year's
Smoker shatters the usual
image of a studious University
medical student and uncovers
the fact that even the people
beneath the white coats have
interests beyond medicine.
"The stereotype is 'work
work work' - don't get me
wrong, that's true - but the
wealth of talent and the col-
lective sense of humor among
med students is mind-bog-
gling," Scott-Craig said. "I
think that's also part of the
surprise of the show, even to

fellow students, like 'Wow
she's an incredible singer' or
''I didn't know that guy could
shred on the guitar!"'
Producer Joshua Cohn,
fourth year med student,
agrees with Scott-Craig and
believes that medical school is
changing.
"The stereotype of the
medical studentwithout inter-
ests in anything else besides
studying, if such a person ever
really existed, is dying off,"
said Cohn. "People come into
school with amazing back-
grounds, interests and talents,
and they don't want to lose
that part of themselves."
After watching the
rehearsal, it's clear that the
participants are more than
just medical students. In fact,
except for the stray pair of
scrubs here and there, it was
difficult, to distinguish the
med students from the "real"
music students practicing
"The Pirates of Penzance"
in the Student Theatre Arts
Complex.

cal community here and there,

promises awell-crafted riot of
laughter and exactly the kind
of tasteless humor college stu-
dents crave most.

'f 'STRAW DOGS' (1971)
A controversial classic

By TIMOTHY RABB
For the Daily
With the arrival -of tlfe 1970s came
a nationwide re-evaluation of the ideal
"viewing audience" in American cinema.
Filmmakers undertook a collective effort
to appeal to the interests of a variety of
social groups as they attempted to tran-
scend the singular notion of a traditional
white middle-class family that was prev-
alent in the 1950s and '60s.
As aresult,the dawnofthenew decade
saw a new cinematic characterization
of human nature and a penchant for its
darker side. Films -like "A Clockwork
Orange" depicted psychological isolation
in its most grotesque forms using perva-
sive visuals of sex and violence.
One of the most brutal of these films is
British director Sam Peckinpah's "Straw
Dogs," released in 1971. The depersonal-
ization the movie foists upon the viewer
can best be summed up in the verse by
philosopher Lao-Tzu from which the
movie borrows its name: "Heaven and
earth are not humane, and regard the
people as straw dogs."
"Straw Dogs" tells the story of a
young American professor named David
(Dustin Hoffman) who leaves the United
States with his English wife Amy (Susan
George) amid the turmoil of the Viet-
nam War. David, a weak-willed and sul-

len pacifist, hopes to abandon the chaos
of his former life in favor of the pastoral
fields of Britain. Rather than finding
peace, however, David is forced to bear
the harassment of the raucous group of
men he has employed to repair his cot-
tage. When he attempts to befriend the
troublemakers in the spirit of peace-
ful conflict resolution, a few of the men
lead him away from his property under
Peckinpah's brutal
look at our
animalistic nature.
the guise of a hunting trip, only to creep
back into his home and violate his wife
in what may be one of the most intensely
disturbing rape scenes of contemporary
cinema.
The horrific nature of the scene does
not lie solely in its demoralizing effect
on Amy, but also in her reaction to the
forcible sexual advances of her assail-
ant. During the attack, Amy's emotions
seem to vacillate between revulsion and
pleasure. Many of the feminist critics of
the film considered this lack of clarity to
be evidence of misogynistic undertones.
Because of the controversial nature of

the scene, Britain banned the film in
1984 after it passed new decency laws.
The film was also not licensed for DVD
release until 2002.
Though the movie's controversial
approach to sexuality contributes to its
appeal, the most compelling scene of the
movie is the culmination of violence at
the end, when David is forced to rely on
animal instinct to defend his property
from a large group of men that includes
his wife's attackers. It is at this point that
thetrue intention ofthemovie isrevealed
to be a character study of David.
As he prepares to face the men who
intend to kill him, David is subjected
to a spontaneous transfiguration that
renders his demeanor unrecognizable:
He methodically repairs the displaced
right lens in his glasses and plays a vinyl
album that espouses a cacophonous har-
monization of bagpipes. David's abil-
ity to casually adapt to the destructive
onslaught of his oppressors suggests
that the viewer has been deceived, and
that this bumbling pacifist may actually
kill for a living.
Sam Peckinpah's stunning film is
important in the context of the moral
debate it poses with its infamous rape
scene. But the film's real value of the film
is its use of provocative visuals to char-
acterize human beings as inherently ani-
mal in nature.

ing and rapping), graffiti, turn-tabling and
breakdancing. Some also add a fifth element:
the message.
Much attention is paid to the message in
The Cypher's writing exercises, which are
Lockett's favorite part of the Tuesday gather-
ings. Although he likes freestyling, he says it's
not as enjoyable for him as writingbecause he's
"not as quick a thinker as the rest of the guys."
He writes about whatever comes to mind at the
time - being broke, school and family issues -
explaining that the last thing he penned was
a Peter Pan-esque rap about how he doesn't
want to grow up.
LSA freshman Cholton Price, another avid
writer in The Cypher, said, "I've been writing
for as long as I can remember." Usually he jots
down the first thing that comes to his head,
sometimes touching on more personal sub-
ject matter like his father, who passed away in
2003.
Butwhatever The Cypher's members choose
to write about, they take pride in writing and
rapping for themselves instead of for execu-
tives and mainstream audiences.
"I'm not talking about rap on the radio,"
Wyszewianski said. "Not some greased-up,
bulletproof man staring at you thug-mugging
on the wall sellingrecords that were made with
money earned from selling crack-cocaine."
Wyszewianski blames the mainstream
media for the studio gangster image. He says
that people are spoon-fed negative stereo-
types perpetuated by record executives and
the media, influencing the general public to
equate hip hop with violent, drug-dealing

gangbangers.
For these reasons, the Ann Arbor hip-hop
community is kept underground. But members
of The Cypher don't necessarily see that as a
bad thing. Lockett explains that hip hop has to
be underground in order to stick to its roots,
because "once an artist gets signed, it becomes
more about what sells."
Boachie-Ansah agreed. "If you want to keep
an art form pure, you have to keep it from
becomingsomething that will turn into profit,"
he said.
Although hip hop might be underground as
far as the masses are concerned, to the mem-
bers of The Cypher, it's a lifestyle. Riddell says
thathe feels most comfortable with others who
are involved in the hip-hop community, equat-
ing it with a brotherhood.
But The Cypher is not the only organization
on campus supportingthehip-hop community.
Freestyle Fridays, an offshoot of The Cypher, is
a more informal group in which anybody who
is interested can participate in freestyle rap
battles. During warmer months, this happens
on the Diag around 2 p.m. every Friday, and
when it's cold outside the group meets by the
posting wall in Mason Hall. Several members
of The Cypher also attend The U-Club Poetry
Slam every other Thursday.
Hip hop in Ann Arbor is not limited to cam-
pus. In addition to frequent hip-hop shows at
The Blind Pig, The Firefly holds an event called
Elevator Sundays, featuring an open mic with
the world-renowned DJ Graffiti.
While the hip-hop community might appear
to be underground to the general public, it's
very much alive for those involved. Groups like
The Cypher, along with bars and clubs around
Ann Arbor, support a thriving scene of artists
who are destroying negative stereotypes with
their words, beats and harmonies.
