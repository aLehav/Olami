Program aims to 
improve access to 
healthcare abroad

By TOM McBRIEN

Daily Staff Reporter

Three patients who would 

have normally died of kidney 
failure received the first kidney 
transplants in Ethiopia thanks 
to a partnership between the 

University 
and 
Ethiopian 

doctors.

The 
partnership 
between 

the University Hospital and 
St. Paul’s Hospital Millennium 
Medical 
College 
in 
Addis 

Ababa aims to train Ethiopian 
doctors 
in 
sub-specialties 

such as transplantations and 
obstetrics while also helping the 
University train its students and 
faculty.

By focusing on building the 

kidney transplantation services 

first, the program intends to 
train Ethiopian specialists and 
improve hospital services such 
as 
laboratory 
facilities 
and 

the intensive care units — all 
improvements that can then be 
spread to hospitals across the 
country.

Senait 
Fisseha, 
adjunct 

professor 
of 
obstetrics 
and 

gynecology at the University 
and a native Ethiopian, has 
dreamed of participating in 
a program like this since she 

started her medical training.

“When I came here for school, 

all along from undergrad I had 
a conception of going back to 
work on building the healthcare 
system in Ethiopia,” she said.

As a medical fellow, Fisseha 

traveled 
to 
Ethiopia 
about 

two times per year, building 
connections she hoped would 
someday benefit her country. 
First, she established ties with 
the 
Ethiopian 
Ministry

Reps also discuss 
new DPSS unit for 

sexual assault, 
abuse victims

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Representatives 
from 
the 

University’s Division of Public 
Safety and Security briefed 
Central Student Government 
on new initiatives aimed at 
preventing alcohol and drug 
abuse on campus and aiding 
survivors 
of 
criminal 
and 

sexual assault. The assembly 
also discussed CSG’s ongoing 
initiative to keep dining halls 
opening earlier on football 
game days.

Prevention of alcohol 

abuse by minors

Bryan Baker, the DPSS liaison 

to student life, said the division’s 
goals for reducing alcohol abuse 
by minors on campus will be 
attained through several new 
initiatives.

One such effort is a plain 

clothes detail. Officers have 
already been patrolling campus 
in plain clothes and distributing 

minor in possession tickets. The 
detail began this year and is 
funded through a special grant.

DPSS officer Justin Berent 

said the detail was not conceived 
as an undercover operation to 
trick underage students.

“We always have some kind 

of badge,” Berent said. “Not 
entrapment, it’s just reducing 
underage drinking.”

Special Victims Unit

Berent 
has 
been 
with 

DPSS for five years and is 
now a member of the UMPD 
Special Victims Unit, which is 
dedicated to responding to and 
investigating cases of sexual 
assault, 
domestic 
violence, 

stalking and child abuse.

The unit comprises of five 

officers 
trained 
to 
handle 

various emergency situations 
and who also receive specific 
training 
for 
dealing 
with 

trauma.

“If you’re involved in a 

traumatic 
event, 
we 
know 

how your body and your mind 
responds to that,” Berent said.

Baker asked CSG to spread the 

word about other new resources 
provided by DPSS with students 
in mind, including statistical 
information about past crimes

After speech in 

Detroit, ‘U’ president 
cautions fraternities, 

sororities

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Reporter

Questions about Greek life 

just seem to follow University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

wherever he goes.

After 
speaking 
to 
the 

Detroit 
Economic 
Club 
on 

Tuesday afternoon as part of a 
presentation called “Powering 
Michigan’s 
Future 
with 

Innovative Ideas and Human 
Capital,” 
Schlissel 
spoke 
to 

reporters about what he deemed 
the potentially self-destructive 
nature of Greek life.

According to reports from 

both the Detroit Free Press 
and the Detroit News, Schlissel 
said fraternities and sororities 
may slowly fade out of campus 
culture if they continue down 
their current paths.

“Unless 
… 
the 
students 

themselves moderate some of 
the risky behavior … they may 
naturally wither and people 
may want to stop joining them,” 
he said.

Schlissel 
and 
other 
key 

administrators 
met 
with 

students from all chapters of 
University Greek life last month, 
where 
Schlissel 
told 
those 

in attendance that the party 
culture associated with Greek 
life is a stain on the University’s 
reputation.

“The value of their degrees 

are going to go down because 
the reputation of the University 
of 
Michigan 
won’t 
be 
the 

excitement in the Big House or 
our teams doing well under our 
fantastic new coach,” Schlissel 
said in the meeting. “It’s not 
going to be the kids who receive 
the Rhodes Scholarships and 
the 
Fulbright 
Scholarships, 

and 
the 
famous 
professors 

who do the work that you’re 
going to get reflected on for, 
or the National Medal for the 
Arts that our faculty won this 

Roland Blackwood 
fields questions from 

undergraduates 

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Roland Blackwood, associate 

professor of pediatrics, spoke 
to 
undergraduate 
students 

about his work fighting health 

care inequality in Southeast 
Michigan, and provided advice 
on thriving in the pre-med 
track and medical school on 
Tuesday night.

Blackwood noted several 

statistics 
that 
point 
to 

disparities 
in 
health. 
For 

example, white women have 
the greatest life expectancy 
and Black men have the lowest.

A 
person’s 
location 
and 

environment can dramatically 

affect health outcomes, too, he 
noted.

“Health can be related to 

all kinds of factors,” he said. 
“One of the things that people 
don‘t realize is that where you 
live can affect how long you 
live … In one ZIP code, the 
life expectancy can be 72 and 
another it‘s 86.”

Turning 
to 
his 
efforts 

to fight these inequalities, 

After vandalism 
charge, sentence 
includes $5,000 

in restitution

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

The criminal case against 

a former member of the 
University’s disbanded Sigma 
Alpha Mu chapter has resulted 
in a probation sentence.

University 
alum 
Jesse 

Krumholz received two years 
of probation for a misdemeanor 
charge 
on 
Tuesday, 
the 

Associated Press reported. His 
sentence also includes paying 
$5,000 in restitution and $400 
in costs, as well as 100 hours of 
community service, which he 
has already completed.

Otsego County Prosecutor 

Michael Rola was unavailable 
for

afternoon.

Raising money for research

WEDNESDAY:

In Other Ivory Towers

A 
philanthropy 
event 

focused on hockey is coming to 
Evanston, Illinois to raise funds 
for brain tumor awareness, the 
Daily Northwestern reported 
Sunday.

The event, named Dropping 

the 
Puck 
on 
Cancer, 
is 

scheduled to begin Jan. 16 over 
the Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
holiday weekend.

According 
to 
the 
Daily 

Northwestern, the fraternities 
involved 
are 
the 
school’s 

chapters of Beta Theta Pi, 
Sigma Chi, Phi Kappa Psi and Pi 
Kappa Alpha. They are seeking 
more Greek organizations to 
collaborate with.

They 
will 
host 
the 

tournament for about two 
weeks 
during 
the 
winter 

semester after Interfraternity 
Council 
and 
Panhellenic 

Association recruitment has 
ended.

The 
organizers 
of 
the 

event said they hope it will 
be 
successful. 
They

Former Rep. John Dingell during the Mackinac Policy Conference in the Grand Hotel May 2014.

Former U.S. 
representative 

retired at start of 

this year

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily Staff Reporter

Former Congressman John 

Dingell was admitted to the 
Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit 
Monday and will undergo a 
heart procedure, according to a 
statement released by his wife’s 
office.

In a short statement, Rep. 

Debbie Dingell (D-Dearborn) 
said her husband was “resting 
comfortably under doctor’s care 
and is his usual feisty self.” 

Dingell also underwent a 

heart procedure at the same 
hospital last March to correct 
abnormal heart rhythms. 

The statement also noted 

that Rep. Dingell will remain 
in Michigan for the week, and 
will not travel to Washington. 
The 
House 
is 
in 
session 

Tuesday through Thursday of 
this week. 

Preceding the official state-

ment from his wife’s office, 
Dingell also tweeted the news 
earlier in the afternoon.

“Back in the hospital,” the 

tweet read. “Being old sucks.”

Dingell, 89, retired from 

Congress following the end of 
his term this January. He first 
took office in 1955, following his 
father who previously held the 
seat, and is the longest serving 

member of the body in history 
with 59 years in office. 

During his time in the House 

Dingell chaired the House and 
Commerce 
Committee 
and 

sat on multiple subcommit-
tees within it, including those 
for Health, Environment and 
Economy, and Oversight and 
Investigation. 

He was heavily involved in 

a slate of landmark legislative 
environment 
achievements 

during his time in office, among 
them the Clean Water Act, the 
Clean Air Act and the Nation-
al Environmental Policy Act. 
Dingell was also an advocate 
for health, sponsoring bills to 
protect patient rights through 
requiring private insurance for 
all Americans and increasing 
responsibilities for insurers, 

as well as contributing to the 
Affordable Care Act. 

In 2014, Dingell was award-

ed the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom by President Barack 
Obama, which is the highest 
honor a civilian can recieve. He 
holds a honorary degree from 
the University, awarded at the 
2015 spring commencement. 

Dingell is also a frequent visi-

tor to the University’s campus,, 
teaching class sessions at the 
Ford School of Public Policy 
during the fall semester. He 
has also donated six decades of 
papers to the University’s Bent-
ley Historical Library, includ-
ing correspondence bills and 
photographs. At the time, the 
donation was one of the larg-
est to the library’s historical 
archive.

Farmer donates 
woolly mammoth 
fossils to Natural 
History Museum

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

A mammoth win for pale-

ontologists occurred Monday 
when the farmer who found 
woolly mammoth bones on his 
property in Washtenaw County 
donated the specimen to the 
University.

Last week James Bristle was 

installing a drainage pipe in his 
Chelsea, Mich. soybean field 
when he discovered the unusual 
bones. What he first mistook as a 
fence turned out to be a rib bone. 
When Bristle realized the mag-

nitude of his discovery he con-
tacted the University and Dan 
Fisher, a professor of paleontol-
ogy and director of the Univer-
sity’s Museum of Paleontology.

The mammoth will be named 

the Bristle Mammoth after the 
farmer who found it. Fisher said 
the discovery is in the top 10 most 
significant mammoth discoveries 
in Michigan’s recorded history.

University 
researchers 

believe the mammoth is a hybrid 
of a woolly mammoth and a 
Columbian 
mammoth 
which 

lived around 11,700 and 15,000 
years ago.

Fisher hopes to display the 

mammoth at the Museum of 
Natural History after they exca-
vate it. With a skull, two tusks, 
the pelvis, ribs, vertebrae, its 
shoulder blades uncovered, so 
far the researchers have 20 per-
cent of a full mammoth skeleton.

Detroit activist 
Grace Lee Boggs 
dies at age 100

Activist and civil rights pioneer 

Grace Lee Boggs passed away 
Monday morning. She turned 100 
this past summer.

Free 
Press 

reported 
that 
Boggs 
died 

peacefully in her home. Boggs is 
to be cremated and a memorial 
will be held for her later this

Throughout her life, she was a 

prominent figure in activism for 
Black power, Black revolution, 
educational reform and more.

Michigan Senate 
raises fines for selling 
cigarettes to minors

Tuesday, the Michigan Senate 

unanimously approved a bill that 
increases the fines for selling 
cigarettes to minors. The offense 
is a misdemeanor and was 
punishable by a fine of $50 for 
more than 27 years. 

If the Michigan House of 

Representatives also approves 
the bill, the fine would be raised 
to $100 for the initial violation 
and 
has 
the 
possibility 
of 

becoming a $500 fine for each 
subsequent violation. 

The bill was sponsored by 

Sen. Steve Bieda (D–Warren)
and will now move to the 
House of Representatives for 
consideration. 

Local weed advocate 
protests deer cull 

At the Monday night Ann 

Arbor City Council meeting, 
councilmember Chuck Warpe-
hoski (D–Ward 5) shared con-
cerns of an open carry protest in 
response to the deer cull. 

The deer cull, approved by 

City Council in mid-August, is 
planned for this winter. The cull 
is a controlled kill of 100 deer to 
help with population control in 
the city. 

Charmie Gholson, a longtime 

friend of Warpehoski, wrote on 
her Facebook page advocating 
for an open carry protest in front 
of City Council members’ hous-
es. She said she wanted to show 
council members what a cull 
would look like in the city. 

Gholson also told MLive that 

she is against the cull because 
students often go to natural 
areas and city parks to smoke 
marijuana at night. She said she 
is worried tht the cull sharp-
shooters could harm the high 
school and college students. 

Warpehoski shared the status 

with his fellow council mem-
bers and said he was looking at 
this issue as a learning moment. 
He said the cull is intended to 
help Ann Arbor’s ecosystem 
and lower the amount of deer-
induced accidents. He also said 
the cull is done inconspicuously, 
unlike the open carry protest.

expenditures.

CSG treasurer Kevin Ziegler, 

a Business senior, said more than 
2,600 students have benefitted 
from the pilot program since its 
inception last month.

“The highlight of this program 

is the safety and well-being of 
students on this campus, which I 
think everyone in this room can 
get behind,” he said.

Public Policy sophomore Jacob 

Pearlman, CSG student general 
counsel, said the program was a 
high priority for CSG members 

and that they should encourage 
more students to show up for 
early game day dining, in part 
by reaching out to student 
organizations.

“The more swipes, the better it 

looks,” Pearlman said.

Alcohol consumption in 

Munger Graduate Residences

Dentistry student Alexander 

Ziegler 
proposed 
drafting 
a 

resolution to allow residents of 
the Munger Graduate Residences 
to consume alcohol in their own 
hall.

The newly opened Munger 

Graduate Residence exclusively 
accommodates 
graduate 

students, a large number of 
whom are older than 21 and can 
legally drink and possess alcohol.

Ziegler said Michigan Housing 

informed 
the 
residents 
that 

alcohol would only be permitted 

in the lounges or dorm rooms. 
The rule, he said, restricts 
the ability of the community 
members to drink in any other 
meeting room or communal area 
within the residence hall.

“Last weekend, there was 

supposed to be a Medical School 
event and they were told shortly 
before the event that they could 
not have alcohol, which forced 80 
to 100 people into an apartment,” 
Ziegler said.

Why I’m basic and proud to be

I

t’s 
government’s 
primary 

responsibility to make and sell 
all the products and services 

that 
private-

sector business 
can’t or won’t. I 
believe the most 
basic of these 
responsibili-
ties to be infra-
structure. So, I 
want to take this 
column to talk 
about our infra-
structure. Most-
ly because I’m 
trying to bore 
you all to death.

Let’s quickly define our infra-

structure in the local context. To be 
simple, let’s call it our roads, bridg-
es and all the pipes that run beneath 
our streets. To be even simpler, let’s 
just talk about our roads.

In Michigan, 40 percent of the 

major urban roads are in poor con-
dition. To give some context, that 
puts our state at fifth-worst in the 
nation in a list including Washing-
ton, D.C. But why care? The simple 
answer is it costs you money. The 
average Michigan driver will spend 
$686 per year in added vehicle 
repair costs from poor road condi-
tions. That’s the third-highest rate 
in the nation. 

Now drive 50 miles south and 

notice that Ohio has better roads 
than we do. How is the worst state 
in the Union able to do road repair 
right? The simple truth is Ohio 
spends more on roads than we do — 
by just $60 per person per year.

While I’m not a statistician, I do 

understand that correlation may 
not mean causation. Surely a state’s 

economy is more complex than the 
health of its infrastructure. But let’s 
ask again: Why care? The complex 
answer is that better roads mean 
more trade, more trade means more 
business and more business means 
more jobs.

It seems as though when Demo-

crats — full disclosure, I am one 
— want to demonstrate a positive 
effect from increased government 
spending, we point across the pond 
to Europe. When Michigan Repub-
licans want to claim the opposite, 
they cite the Mackinac Center for 
Public Policy. It’s startling then 
that both the European Union and 
the Mackinac Center hold the same 
to be true: Investment in infra-
structure grows the economy, and 
the return on investment is huge.

Better roads decrease the cost of 

transportation for everyone. That 
means a better bottom line for com-
panies operating in Michigan. Those 
companies grow and hire more. 
And specialized manufacturers and 
service providers thrive in that eco-
nomic environment. The effect is so 
evident that the return on invest-
ment can be as large a 0.24- percent 
growth in the economy per 1-percent 
increase in transportation spend-
ing. In Michigan, that would mean 
almost $450 million in economic 
growth for every $10 million invest-
ed in our transportation system. 

But despite everyone’s advice, the 

majority of our state’s legislators 
in Lansing disagree; Ann Arbor’s 
delegation is not among them. The 
result of this disinvestment in our 
basics is too many broken roads 
and crumbling bridges. Michigan’s 
general-fund revenues are nearly 
the same size they were 15 years 

ago — in real dollars, not adjusted 
for inflation. I think a lot of bad pol-
iticians are proud of that fact. But 
good public servants would only 
take pride in that fact if their state 
were healthy and wealthy. Seem-
ingly, ours is neither. 

The blunt truth is, when it comes 

to our roads, Lansing has failed the 
people of Michigan. Now it’s up to 
local governments, from progressive 
Ann Arbor to conservative Grand 
Rapids, to clean up the mess — a mess 
that can be measured in flat tires, 
decreased business and lost jobs.

Now, these are the fixes we need 

today. However, I challenge us to 
expand our understanding of infra-
structure from one that gives sin-
gular priority to the car to one that 
knows the only solutions to a city’s 
needs will take the walker, biker, 
bus rider and rail user into account. 
I challenge us to understand that 
the car cannot and should not be 
the future of the American city.

But if you can’t trust your gov-

ernment to get the basics right, how 
can you trust them to tackle the 
exceptional?

In Ann Arbor, we want to tackle 

the exceptional. So let’s ceaselessly 
strive to get the basics right. Let’s 
ensure our streets are maintained 
and safe, let’s clean up our customer 
service, and let’s pick up recycling 
and plow snow on time, every time.

If I can be of any help, when it 

comes to the basics or the excep-
tional, feel free to reach out.

ZACHARY
ACKERMAN

O

n a rainy Saturday after-
noon, I anxiously sat on a 
large, mildly heated tour bus 

that was driving 
around 
Detroit 

for 
the 
course 

History 
and 

Future of Detroit. 
My 
anxiety 

stemmed 
from 

sitting on the bus, 
pretending to be a 
tourist in the land 
I call home. I’m a 
native Detroiter, 
born and raised 
in the place popu-
larly known as Motor City, the birth-
place of Motown, the Murder Capital, 
post-apocalyptic and, most recently, 
post-bankruptcy. Detroit is often asso-
ciated with negative attributes, yet 
recent efforts to revitalize the city is 
constantly challenging this narrative. 
Because few people know the his-
torical landscape of Detroit, and often 
formulate their judgements around 
personal or second-hand experiences 
with the city, their judgments about 
the city’s current standing are often 
ill-informed. 

I’m a defensive Detroiter, because 

I always feel the city is being scruti-
nized for its every action. I feel a duty 
to be prepared to counteract any nega-
tive critique or generalized stereotype 
of the city. Detroit is constantly being 
watched so closely, so precisely, that 
Detroit’s name appears in national 
headlines on a regular basis.

Though I acknowledge that there is 

a lot that cities can learn from Detroit, 
I feel uncomfortable being observed 
as an ongoing case study. By taking 
the course, I was able to see Detroit 
through the lens of these academ-
ics and journalists who were curious 
about the city’s decline, and how it 
would manage to climb out of what 
seems like a rabbit hole.

A tour of Detroit was the central 

component of the course. I took the 
class to continue learning about the 
history and contemporary conditions 
of Detroit. I also had ulterior motives 
to see what history, or whose history, 
of Detroit was actually presented.

The class visited several neighbor-

hoods and landmarks in the city and 
suburbs of Detroit, 95 percent of which 
I had visited before and was familiar 
with. Whenever students were let off 
the bus, people quickly whipped out 
their digital devices to collect their 
own primary documentation of their 
exposure to Detroit. I couldn’t help but 
feel like a bystander, one who was anx-
ious to know people’s perceptions of 
the images their cell phones captured. 
I wanted to know what questions I 
could clarify, or what misjudgments I 

could rectify with information.

Despite being a life-long resident 

of the city, I’m no expert on Detroit. 
From taking the course, and even 
from taking the tour, I have learned 
a great deal of historical details. 
Yet, there were points in lecture 
and on the tour when I felt obligat-
ed to speak. While I couldn’t recite 
historical dates or cite specific poli-
cies that have led to the systematic, 
institutional and political demise of 
the city, I could talk about what cit-
izens were doing to transform their 
own communities. I could touch 
on the intricacies of illusioned but 
somewhat accurate bureaucracy of 
the Detroit city government, bound 
by both external (lost sovereignty 
to an emergency financial manager 
for the city and the school district) 
and internal mechanisms (Detroit’s 
City Charter).

I hesitated to speak for fear of 

being labeled the know-it-all. Insert-
ing myself into the space of my 
professor’s authority and offering 
commentary felt intrusive. I felt as 
if I actually didn’t belong with my 
classmates on this tour; I belonged 
on the streets, with the other people 
going about their day.

This is sometimes the complete 

opposite of how I have felt in class-
rooms, where I have been singled out 
to speak on first-hand accounts of 
living in Detroit, as if students from 
Detroit were either the witnesses or 
defense attorneys against the pros-
ecuting evidence of Detroit’s demise. 
There never seems to be a comfortable 
place to situate my identity as a Detroi-
ter at the University — I’m either a 
tourist or a representative, a student 
or a teacher. While these identities can 
co-exist, they often come with inter-
nal tension.

I’m curious to know if this tension 

exists for residents of other metropoli-
tan areas. I recently visited Boston. 
Being the independent adventurer I 
am, I mapped out a plan to visit Bos-
ton’s historic sites. I contemplated tak-
ing a trolley tour to give me a history of 
Boston and visit its historic relics, but 
the tour of the Freedom Trail that out-
lined landmarks of the Revolutionary 
War didn’t include places that encom-
passed Boston’s Black history. There 
was a separate Black Freedom Trail 
(because, of course, in our society, 
cultural histories are not a part of U.S. 
history, just a diversion from the main 
narrative) that I chose to explore in 
combination with the Freedom Trail.

I felt my identity as a tourist exposed 

entering into museums and other 
obvious tourist destinations. Though 
walking throughout the streets of 
Boston, I wondered how often resi-
dents of a city get to know their own 

history, their neighborhoods and their 
people. Do residents travel to different 
areas of the city? How frequently do 
residents visit their own museums and 
cultural centers? How often are we 
confined to our immediate boundaries 
that we never seek to know every part 
of a place that we tie our identities to? 

College students are easily sus-

ceptible to being confined in their 
immediate space known as the college 
bubble. Students come from all across 
the world to expand their education, 
though they sparingly capitalize on 
supplementing their education with 
becoming familiar with the area our 
institutions are rooted in.

As residents of Ann Arbor, how 

much do students know about Ann 
Arbor history? How many people 
know Michigan Stadium is the larg-
est stadium in the country, and the 
third-largest stadium in the world? 
Or that President Lyndon B. Johnson 
revealed his plan of the Great Soci-
ety at the University in May of 1964? 
That Ann Arbor was the birthplace 
of the White Panther Party, which is 
an anti-racist political organization? 
That in 1975, Albert H. Wheeler was 
Ann Arbor’s first African-American 
mayor? Or how Ann Arbor’s historic 
train depot was transformed into 
a renowned restaurant called the 
Gandy Dancer? Do students know 
that the Office of Academic and Mul-
ticultural Initiatives was created as a 
result of the first Black Action Move-
ment? Is our interaction with cities 
transactional? Are students merely 
tourists of the city that supports their 
educational grounding?

Cities are transformational land-

scapes, most profoundly for the lives 
of its inhabitants. It’s imperative that 
residents have a grounding in the his-
tory and landscape of the city in its 
entirety, which is why initiatives such 
as place-based education are vital to 
educating future generations. Being 
a well-informed citizen doesn’t just 
mean attaining a certain educational 
level, but also knowing about the com-
munity that one inhabits.

Understanding your community is 

a part of understanding your identity. 
I encourage everyone to expand their 
knowledge and identity by continu-
ously engaging with their communi-
ties through events and community 
forums, visiting historic sites or learn-
ing the unconventional community 
spaces that designate the unique 
atmosphere of each city. Only through 
understanding our history, and there-
by understanding ourselves, can we 
build livable, inclusive and sustainable 
cities for generations to come.

FROM THE DAILY

T

he First Amendment protects professional journalists, 
alongside all other citizens, enabling them to print news freely 
without censorship from the government. Unfortunately, 

collegiate journalists at schools without independent papers are 
not afforded the same protections from their governing bodies: 
school administrations. Currently, there’s no legislation in Michigan 
protecting the freedom of the student presses from administrative 
censorship. Without a clear right to editorial freedom expressed under 
law, collegiate newspapers, in both public and private schools, are at 
risk of being taken advantage of by school administrators and others 
seeking to repress students’ free speech rights.

Defending student journalists

Michigan must pass legislation to protect collegiate newspapers

At Northern Michigan University, the 

newspaper staff’s investigations into the 
administration 
and 
Board 
of 
Trustees’ 

actions resulted in the removal of journalism 
faculty adviser Cheryl Reed. The newspaper’s 
administrative board provided no clear reason 
for the removal. In addition to removing Reed 
as the faculty adviser, current managing editor 
Michael Williams was prevented from taking 
the position of editor in chief, even though he 
was the only applicant. Reed and Williams 
filed a lawsuit last month to defend their 
rights as journalists. Clearly, some sort of legal 
protection must be put in place to protect the 
free speech of college journalists.

A similar incident occurred at Butler 

University, a private school in Indianapolis, 
when the student newspaper faculty adviser, 
Loni McKown, was spontaneously removed 
and temporarily replaced with a public 
relations staffer from the university as an 
interim adviser. The Butler administration’s 
reasoning for McKowan’s removal cited her 
accidental forwarding of a confidential e-mail 
and her involvement in student editorial 
decisions. Even though students from the 
paper expressed their disagreement with 
the latter suggestion, the university still 
ousted McKowan as an adviser. Replacing a 
journalist with a public relations employee 
is an absurd action that limits the freedom 
of collegiate journalism. The administration 
acting for its own PR benefits at the expense 
of journalists furthers the need for protection 
of students that professionals have through 
the First Amendment.

According to the Student Press Law Center, 

only nine states have laws protecting students’ 

free expression, in varying degrees; addition-
ally, two states have adopted student speech 
rights in their education codes. Of the nine 
states with legal protections, California’s 2006 
law allowing First Amendment rights to be 
extended to high school and collegiate news-
papers from prior review and restraint from 
their administration in both the private and 
public sectors, is the most extensive. The state 
of Michigan should adopt similar legislation 
to protect free speech of all student journal-
ists and to ensure non-financially independent 
newspapers remain editorially independent.

The objective of collegiate journalism, 

beyond offering an outlet for students to be 
connected to their environment, is to act as a 
check and balance on the workings of school 
administrations. Without the watchful eye of 
the media, corruption may occur within the 
offices of high-ranking administrators. This 
combination of education and administrative 
oversight is a valuable resource for University 
communities to have. Administrators should 
welcome the challenge of being held account-
able. Furthermore, just as student journalists 
shed light on managerial administrative mis-
givings for the student body, they also bring 
dishonest acts by students to the attention of 
those with authority.

Censorship of journalism harmfully affects 

the education of future journalists. If young 
journalists are not allowed to report freely, 
they will not properly learn and practice the 
ethics of journalism and therefore not be able 
to keep university administrators in check. 
Ensuring their freedom of speech through law 
is the only practical option to keep the college 
press free.


Health, which was supportive 
of her efforts.

“Unless you accept that many 

men and women will be left to 
die, there is no other option,” 
Fisseha said. “And transplants 
are much more cost-effective 
long-term than 
dialysis. So the 
government 
is 

committed 
to 

making 
this 

work.”

In 
2011, 

Fisseha reached 
out to Surgery 
Prof. 
Jeffrey 

Punch, 
a 

transplantation 
specialist 
with 

experience 
doing 
mission 

work in Africa, and Internal 
Medicine Prof. Akinlolu Ojo, 
a Nigerian nephrologist with 
research projects in Africa.

The 
three, 
motivated 
to 

enact lasting change, agreed 
that the program had to focus 
on training.

“There are many universities 

around the United States and 
Europe where faculty or large 
groups of people will go and 
do these big fancy surgeries 
and 
leave,” 
Fisseha 
said. 

“That usually does more harm 
than good in that country 
because they’re not thinking 
of complications or teaching 
the local faculty. So (Punch) 
was really careful from the 
beginning to say that that’s not 
what he wants to do.”

Though the program focuses 

mainly 
on 
transplantation 

services, Punch said all sub-
specialty care should improve 
due to associated infrastructure 

and training changes.

“The lab has to get better, 

the nurses have to get better, 
the ICU has to get better. Even 
housekeeping has to get better 
because 
everything 
needs 

to be cleaner,” Punch said. 
“Everything has to get better 
for transplant to be a success, 
and that’s why it took so long. 
They have other needs, too, 
like open-heart surgery, and 

many of the 
things 
that 

they 
needed 

to put in place 
for 
kidney 

transplant 
to 

be 
successful 

will be there 
when 
they 

get around to 
initiating 
an 

open-heart 
program at St. 
Paul’s.”

Fisseha 

and Punch both said despite 
the success of the first three 
transplants, many Ethiopians 
who 
need 
dialysis 
or 
a 

transplant will not be able to 
receive medical care. From 
observing 
their 
neighbors’ 

efforts, 
Ethiopian 
officials 

realized 
the 

training 
and 

infrastructure 
improvements 
need 
to 
be 

methodical 
and thorough.

“Many 

of 
the 
other 

countries 
that 
have 

started kidney 
transplants like Ghana, Nigeria 
and Kenya, they’re honestly not 
doing it in a systematic way and 
honestly I think it’s hurting the 
development of that process 
in 
their 
countries,” 
Punch 

explained. “The way it’s going 

to work in Ethiopia is there 
will be one major center that 
will be very well established 
and will become hopefully a 
high-volume place, so then it 
will have the resources to train 
additional people that can start 
other programs in surrounding 
cities.”

The 
program 
organizers 

hope the supply of life-saving 
surgeries can match the demand 
within 20 years. Despite the 
slow training progress, Fisseha 
explained, the new program 
provides additional cause for 
optimism.

“We are seeing a fascinating 

trend of a lot of young faculty 
who would otherwise leave the 
country staying in-country to 
train and serve their people. 
So 
really 
it’s 
been 
quite 

rewarding,” she said.

There is no predetermined 

end to the partnership. Even 
after the formal program ends, 
program 
organizers 
hope 

collaboration will continue.

“I suspect it won’t end in 

a year, but it will probably 
end by three years. I don’t 
know 
how 
that 
timeframe 

will work exactly. And then 
we will hopefully continue to 

collaborate 
because I think 
it’s 
mutually 

beneficial,” 
Punch 
said. 

“It’s 
an 

opportunity 
for 
our 

residents 
to 

train and see 
diseases 
they 

don’t see back 

here. I’ve seen more cases of 
tuberculosis in Ethiopia than 
I have during my 25 previous 
years as a doctor. And that will 
benefit me if I ever run across a 
case of TB around here, which 
may happen.”

Blackwood discussed various 
programs 
within 
the 
the 

University’s Office of Health 
Equity 
Inclusion, 
where 
he 

serves on the leadership team.

“The 
goal 
of 
our 
office 

is to eliminate health care 
disparities in our lifetime,” he 
said. “One of the things that 
we can do to affect change is to 
create a safe environment and 
to increase representation by 
underrepresented 
minorities 

and 
by 
disadvantaged 

populations.”

Though the talk was intended 

to focus solely on health care 
disparities, Blackwood spent 
much of the time counseling 

pre-med students and sharing 
his own accounts of pursuing 
a career in medicine. When 
Blackwood asked students to 
raise their hands if they were 
pre-med, 
nearly 
all 
of 
the 

roughly 30 attendees put their 
hands in the air.

“I found my own path with 

the gifts that I was given,” 
Blackwood 
said. 
“You 
are 

all 
unique 
individuals. 
You 

have strengths and you have 
weaknesses. Find them.”

He 
then 
said 
students 

should work together to get 
into medical school instead of 
competing with one another.

“When 
you 
become 
a 

physician, you will have to work 
together; it’s a collaboration,” 
he said. “When are you going to 
start?”

LSA 
junior 
Jenna 
Yousif 

attended the event and said 
she found Blackwood’s talk 
encouraging.

“I thought it was pretty 

inspirational 
because 
I 
am 

currently undecided in what I 
want to do, and I think his talk 
pushed me in a direction to 
explore medicine further,” she 
said. 

a 
former 
SAM 
member, 

also received two years of 
probation after he also plead 
guilty to malicious destruction 
of property totaling more than 
$200, but less than $1,000. 
Two other members, Business 
juniors Joshua Kaplan and 
Zachary Levin — the former 
president and treasurer for 
SAM, respectively — turned 
themselves in to the Ann 
Arbor Police Department in 
March on charges of providing 
alcohol to minors. They have 
yet to be sentenced.

They are the only four to 

be charged in connection to 
a January incident during 
which 270 former SAM and 
Sigma 
Delta 
Tau 
sorority 

members caused more than 
$430,000 
in 
damages 
at 

Treetops Resort in Gaylord, 
Mich. during a ski trip.

SAM 
has 
since 
lost 

recognition by the University 
as a student organization and 
was disbanded by its national 
headquarters in March. The 
University’s chapter of the 
Sigma Delta Tau sorority, 
which 
also 
attended 
the 

January trip, is currently 
on 
disciplinary 
suspension 

for their failure to intervene 
during the incident.

past week. It’s going to be 
the ‘Shmacked’ videos. So it’s 
really up to you what the value 
of your education is going to 
be, what the reputation of this 
institution’s going to be.”

Schlissel revisited this point 

Tuesday, 
adding, 
“Parties 

at frats and sororities send 
the wrong message that the 
University of Michigan is a 
party school and not a serious 
research university.”

The University has recently 

taken 
a 
number 
of 
new 

measures to stymie alcohol 
abuse 
in 
particular, 
which 

administrators note is fairly 
prevalent in Greek life and 
linked 
to 
higher 
rates 
of 

sexual assault in the Greek 

community. These new policies 
include 
targeted 
education 

efforts and invoking parental 
involvement following alcohol-
related hospital visits.

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president for student life, has 
also said the University is 
considering delaying the Greek 
rush process in the future.

“Does it make sense to have 

students come, and in a week, 
by the whole pledging process, 
we have thrown them into a 
whole environment that we’re 
worried about?” Harper asked 
in 
a 
September 
interview 

with 
The 
Michigan 
Daily. 

“Should we stay on this path 
we have, where we’ve been so 
committed to self-governance, 
that we allow rush to happen 
sometimes less than a week 
after students get here? So 
we’re certainly going to take a 
look at that.”

Schlissel, 
Harper 
and 
a 

number of other administrators 
have noted that their concern 
for Greek life is not meant to 
seem punitive. Administrators 
have frequently said it’s a 
matter 
of 
students’ 
health 

and wellness. They are also 
quick 
to 
acknowledge 
the 

“good” Greek life contributes 
to the University. Harper and 
Schilssel, in particular, have 
accounted for the philanthropic 
aspects of Greek life — as well 
as GPAs that are, on average, 
higher than the rest of the 
student body.

Schlissel repeated this point 

on Tuesday.

“It’s not my ambition to 

get rid of fraternities and 
sororities,” he said. “There’s a 
tremendous amount of positive 
they bring to our campus.”

“That condo was my life, 

okay? I loved every stick of fur-
niture in that place. That was 
not just a bunch of stuff that got 
destroyed, it was ME!”

Edward 

Norton’s 
narrator 
goes 
on 
to 

thank 
the 

academy for 
a 
harrowed 

performance 
as 
someone 

who actually 
cares 
about 
his 

IKEA furniture. “Fight Club” 
reprimands 
the 
materialist 

society that defines itself by 
the things one owns: “you are 
not how much money you have 
in the bank. You are not your 
fucking khakis.” And maybe 
that’s true about people, but in 
a movie, it’s kind of important. 
In fact, the very essence of 
a movie is defined by the 
stuff that occupies the frame. 
No matter how mundane or 
trivial something seems, the 
director and set designer have 
specifically chosen that object 
to exist in their movie. And 
the effects can be incredibly 
rewarding.

Take this scene from “The 

Godfather pt. 2”: the slant of 
Fredo’s chair prevents him 
from sitting all the way up. In 
the first shot of him, his chin 
is tucked in, creating a double 
chin effect compared to the cut, 
defined features of Michael. 
And when Fredo does try to 
sit up to express his anger, the 
chair pulls him back down; 
Fredo comes off as weak and 
squirmy. He’s trying to exert 
his power over Michael, but the 
chair deprives him of any shred 
of influence that might stem 
from his seniority. And, yes, 
Copolla could have achieved 
the same effect without the 
chair, relying only on his actors, 
but the chair adds a visual 
representation that words alone 
simply could not express.

Sometimes 
the 
object 

captures 
the 
essence 
of 
a 

movie’s 
message, 
rather 

than simply emphasizing a 
desired effect. The last scene 
of “Inception” created much 
debate over whether the top 
fell over, whether Cobb had 
entered reality or remained in 
the dream world. But the top 
itself is an act of deception, 
because it doesn’t really matter. 
The top was not Cobb’s totem 
to use to distinguish between 
the dream and real worlds but 
his wife’s. Cobb’s totem goes 
unnamed (though it’s probably 
his wedding ring), and Cobb’s 
using his wife’s totem is a 
clear violation of the rules and 
advice he gives to every other 
character in the film. Why? 
Because for Cobb, the ability 
to see his kids again, thereby 
achieving the happiness he 
has so longed for, supersedes 
whether it or not that feeling 
derives from reality.

Taking it further, one can 

view “Inception” as a metaphor 
for the creation of a film: 
dreams are the movie itself, 
Cobb is the director, Ariadne 
is the writer, Eames the actor, 
etc. Read in this context, 
the film concludes that the 
realizations and feelings we 
have when watching movies, 
these dreams, are as real and 
as important as anything we 
might experience outside the 
theater. 
The 
spinning 
top, 

this tiny black piece of round 
plastic, has been the focus of 
your attention, but you should 
have been watching everything 
that happens around it.

And why this interest in 

objects, you might ask? Why am 
I not concerned with characters 
and camera angles? Because, 
dudes, I watched “The Big 
Lebowski” last night. And it, 
more than most films I’ve seen, 
takes great pride in the things 
that occupy its space, none 
more so than the Dude’s rug. 
You, know, the one that really 
tied the room together.

I 
watched 
“The 
Big 

Lebowski” for the first time 
years ago, before I knew what 
drugs were, before I stopped 
using the bumpers when I went 
bowling, before I understood 
the Gulf War. But this time, I 
got it. I got “The Big Lebowski.”

And no, it’s not a straight 

genre picture as you might 
think. It’s not a western, as the 
opening shot of tumbleweed 
strolling from the outskirts of 
the desert into the middle of 
LA or Sam Elliot’s The Stranger 
in full cowboy garb might 
insinuate. It’s not a reimagining 
of the film noir, with its 
mistaken 
identity 
plot 
line 

complete with a femme fatale, 

as many critics have stated. And 
it’s not a stoner cult comedy as it 
has come to be associated with. 
Yes, there are strands of all of 
these genres (and musicals and 
screwball comedy and political 
satire), but they are not what 
the film is about.

I had this realization when 

the German nihilists (“say what 
you will about the tenets of 
National Socialism, but at least 
it’s an ethos”) break into the 
Dude’s house, sans rug, smash 
some of his stuff and drop a 
ferret into the bathtub with the 
Dude. After the nihilists left 
and I regained my composure, 
it hit me: this movie is really 
about just how wrecked this 
one dude’s house can get. It’s a 
test of one man’s will.

The Dude is subjected to 

countless 
beatings, 
various 

events of bludgeoning of his 
car, kidnappings and drugging. 
He is used for sex for the sole 
purpose of obtaining his seed, 
and innocent, crazy eyed Steve 
Buscemi dies. And on top of it 
all, his house is destroyed. And 
it’s important that the Dude be 
the recipient of this insanity 
rather than the instigator of 
it. He’s a human punching 
bag, a modern Job, his house 
the plaything of porn star 
kingpins, thugs and nihilists 
(read: 
writers/directors 
Joel 

and Ethan Cohen). And it all 
happens because of a soiled 
rug — a rug that tied the room 
together, kept his life together. 
Without the rug, it all falls apart.

This rug is something of 

a holy grail, and it leads the 
Dude on a path of deceit 
and 
occasional 
death 
and 

destruction. And it’s a difficult 
path, a painfully funny path 
and sometimes a sad path, but, 
through it all, the Dude never 
drops his moral compass. He 
never forgets that lives are on 
the line, nor does he let cruelty 
go without at least calling it out 
first (I’m sure he’d stop it if he 
could. But he can’t, because of 
pacifism, man). He demands 
integrity and compensation, but 
never overstays his welcome.

The 
rug 
represents 
this: 

something unattainable that 
challenges the protagonist. The 
Dude is constantly given the 
opportunity to veer from the 
path, to make a wrong decision, 
to be immoral or inconsiderate, 
but he never does. Such is the 
power of the Dude’s rug, and 
the power of objects in film.

And if you say that I’m reading 

too much into it — well, that’s 
just, like, your opinion, man.

‘Code Black’ does 
ER drama wrong

New CBS series 
dissapointing for 

hospital drama fans

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

There are few genres that are 

as formulaic as doctor shows. 
The most successful medical 
dramas all had 
something else 
going for them: 
“Scrubs” 
was 

funny, 
“ER” 

was addicting 
and 
“Grey’s 

Anatomy,” 
well, “Grey’s” 
will 
probably 

just last forev-
er. But CBS’s 
new 
offering 

is none of these things. “Code 
Black” is clunky and tries too 
hard to make you care before 
you can. If you like seeing blood 
pooling on sterilized hospi-
tal floors in one corner of the 
frame while a different patient 
collapses in another, then this 
show is perfect for you. But, if 
you like developed characters 
and a reasonable lack of clichés, 
then keep looking.

The gimmick in “Code Black” 

that differentiates it is found in 
the title. “Code black” is the term 
for when an ER has too many 
patients and not enough staff or 
resources to provide for all of 
them. This particular hospital in 
L.A. deals with this frequently.

The 
cast 
features 
Luis 

Guzmán (“Narcos”) as a nurse 
who refers to himself as Mama 
and likes to break into song 
occasionally. He’s close with 
the residency director Dr. Ror-
ish (Marcia Gay Harden, “How 
to Get Away with Murder”), a 
tough doctor with a no-time-
for-bullshit demeanor and a 
subtly hinted at tragic past, 
involving a mysterious accident.

Harden does her best with 

what she has been given, but her 
lines are often cringeworthy. 
And it doesn’t help that there 
are more than a couple shots of 
her looking around or walking 
through the halls of the hospi-
tal in slow motion, taking it all 
in as people and noises fade and 
blur, reminiscent of everyone’s 
favorite angsty doctor, Mer-
edith Grey.

The patients in the pilot 

include a gunshot victim, a 
brain-dead 
dad, 
a 
pregnant 

woman passed out on her floor 
because no one realized she was 
suffering from carbon monoxide 
poisoning, a cute kid with a col-

lapsed lung and a stoned teenag-
er with a mysterious head injury, 
among others. They get even 
fewer lines than typical guest 
characters on hospital dramas, 
because there are so many of 
them. And the brand new resi-
dents feel bland; there isn’t a 
single one who stands out.

If I were a child, I would 

complain that watching this 
made me dizzy. As a profession-
al adult TV critic, I would also 
like to complain that watching 
this made me dizzy. Of course, 
an ER is a busy scene, with 
everything happening at once; 
but it’s possible to convey that 
without having to use canted 
angles quite so often.

This show is made for people 

who are still angry about Derek 
dying on “Grey’s Anatomy” and 
need something to fill that void 
if they’re boycotting it — or 
the people who just need more 
pseudo-doctor talk every week. 
It’s not quite “the new ER” like 
it was made out to be.

“Code Black” may eventually 

build its characters into inter-
esting enough people to make 
up for the transparent cases and 
clichéd writing, but it probably 
won’t. After flatlining for the 
majority of the pilot, there are 
few miracles that could jump-
start the heart of this show.

TV REVIEW


Wild Child pure, 
human on ‘Fools’

New album by 

indie-folk duo has 

European sensibility

By DANIELLE RAY

Daily Arts Writer

I first heard of Wild Child last 

semester when my friend came 
back from studying abroad and 
began 
gush-

ing to me about 
their 
show 

in 
Paris. 
She 

quickly became 
obsessed 
and 

so did I, think-
ing I had dis-
covered 
this 

cool, upcoming 
French band before anyone else.

Little did I know, they’re from 

Austin, Texas. But still.

Wild Child’s third studio album, 

Fools, delves even further into this 
foreign-sounding 
pattern; 
this 

effort reminds me more of Coeur 
de pirate — a French-Canadian 
singer-songwriter who produces 
fresh, indie-sounding tunes — than 
anything I’ve ever heard come out 
of Texas.

This is particularly evident on 

“Stones,” the fourth track that 
embodies a mix between Coeur 
and Ingrid Michaelson, as it bobs 
and flows up and down between 
melodies. Track seven, “Take It,” 
keeps the Coeur influence and 
bouncing beat, but also adds in a 
little Adele — a little European soul 
and sass — as lead vocalist Kelsey 
Wilson asks you to “take it, take it 
... how about trusting when I’m not 
around?”

The whole sound of Fools is 

highly refreshing, highly different 
than the mass-produced, cotton-
candy pop music so common today 
— even highly different from other 
American folk or indie bands, as 
it weaves in a European style that 
makes it obvious as to why a Texas 
band could sell a show halfway 
across the world.

The title track begins the album; 

Wilson coos, “thinking that I might 
go crazy. How am I supposed to 
breathe now, baby?” While Wil-
son’s voice is pure and beautiful, 
and the lyrics are enchanting, it’s 
neither of those that pull you into 

Wild Child’s latest effort. Rather 
it’s the fact that Fools sounds more 
like it was mixed in your hipster, 
audio-file friend’s basement than 
a master studio. It becomes highly 
apparent that Wild Child’s latest 
effort isn’t only special because of 
its unique foreign sound, but it’s 
also because of the deep connec-
tion between Wilson’s raw vocals 
and her listener.

Even more so than on previ-

ous albums, Wild Child sounds 
pure, simple and human on Fools 
— unprocessed, if you will. Wilson 
definitely takes center stage on 
all 12 tracks, but Alexander Beg-
gins also makes equally enthrall-
ing appearances, most notably on 
“Meadows,” by far the standout 
track on the album.

“Meadows” begins as a little 

ditty, much like the majority of 
the tracks on the album, but it 
then builds to a crescendo half-
way through that features much 
more obviously processed vocals 
that directly contrast with the 
raw allure of the first half of the 
song. As Wilson asks you to “rid 
your devils; run through fields of 
meadows,” the vocal processing 
mimics that diabolical feeling in its 
opposition to the soft, pure, angelic 
sounds at the start.

Fools is an album that slowly 

draws you in, getting better and 
better with each track. “Bullets,” 
track three, begins by sounding 
almost like a Christmas song. The 
chord progression and rhythm is 
oddly similar to “Jingle Bells,” but 

it ends up sounding more like a 
French-influenced indie-pop tune.

“Meadows” is the next big step-

ping stone as track five, followed 
by “Saving Face,” showing up in 
spot number eight. “Face” is the 
only true duet between Wilson and 
Beggins, and their soulful croon-
ing really makes you believe their 
tale of a love-torn relationship.

“Trillo Talk” closes out the 

album, a seemingly-happy-sound-
ing up-tempo number about a 
breakup: “you say I should have 
been a better babe, and you can 
go be a better babe for anyone else 
but me.” Starting with the voice in 
her head at the beginning of the 
phrase and slowly traveling to her 
lower register, Wilson conveys the 
sense of regret by adding a little 
rasp, a little edge, to her sound.

I can only imagine “Trillo Talk” 

to be an answer to “Rillo Talk,” the 
penultimate track on their previ-
ous studio album, The Runaround 
— a haunting ballad about trying 
to make a relationship work (but 
that’s kind of up for interpretation, 
as are much of Wild Child’s lyrics). 
On “Rillo,” Wilson’s voice is soft, 
dejected almost, and on “Trillo” 
she ramps it up, conveying her 
newfound couldn’t-care-less atti-
tude about the relationship.

Wild Child will be in Ann Arbor 

on Halloween, seemingly appro-
priate to the spooky feeling behind 
Wilson’s voice. Ten out of 10 would 
recommend going, singing along to 
“Meadows,” calling the devil out to 
play the day after Devil’s Night.

JR JR in good form 
on third studio album

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

It’s the first Saturday of the 

year without a football game 
and I’m not entirely sure what to 
do with myself. 
It has been a 
hectic week to 
say the least, 
and 
I 
could 

be using this 
time to write 
that essay that 
I 
have 
been 

putting off or 
doing 
some 

much-needed cleaning of my 
kitchen. Instead, I am spending 
the lovely but dreary day sit-
ting in the same sofa crease for 
six hours, catching up on all the 
shows I have missed. (Is anyone 
else loving “Scream Queens?”)

Besides Kerry Washington 

perpetuating 
my 
obsession 

with Scandal, I have also come 
across an up-and-coming band 
on my Spotify Discover Weekly 
playlist. JR JR, formerly known 
as Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr., is a 
classic 
American 
indie-pop 

band that originated in Detroit 
and now consists of Daniel Zott 
and Joshua Epstein. The two 
met each other while playing 
in other Detroit music proj-
ects, and they began record-
ing in Zott’s basement in Royal 
Oak. They recently released a 
self-titled album on Septem-
ber 25th that deals with the 
classic theme of youth, shed-

ding uncomfortable skin and 
being reborn as their true 
selves. It’s a typical recipe for 
the quintessential “coming-of-
age” soundtrack, yet Zott and 
Epstein manage to transform 
a seemingly simple sound into 
one of poignancy and nostalgia. 
In this third studio album, they 
strip down unnecessary bells 
and whistles to focus on their 
own combination of ideas, cre-
ating songs like “Gone,” which 
to be sung in a karaoke bar, and 
“Hypothetical,” 
which 
uses 

musical techniques I have never 
heard before.

“Caroline” tells a story of 

coming to terms with your own 
decisions 
through 
vibrating 

synthetic piano and lyrics, “Oh 
my Caroline / No one is going 
to live my life for me.” “In The 
Middle” is reminiscent of a 
Duran Duran disco dance track, 
complete with distorted voices 
and electric guitar riffs.

My personal favorite track, 

“Philip the Engineer,” feels like 
the last song played at a bar 
before closing for the night, using 
strange dystopian future meta-
phors to represent fading youth 
and broken relationships. “Time 

makes grownups sound like kids 
/ You can’t stop the time / So 
kiss your kids goodbye,” the song 
fades, tugging on your heart-
strings and forcing you to reflect 
on your own childhood.

“In My Mind (Summertime)” 

switches gears, sounding like an 
indie version of the Beach Boys 
that you would listen to while 
watching the waves lap up on 
the beach. The subdued “In my 
mind / You’re the summertime / 
So please don’t go away” are com-
forting words for someone not 
quite ready for winter yet. (Seri-
ously, where did Fall go?)

 These common ideas of find-

ing love, finding yourself and leav-
ing things behind while growing 
up is what makes JR JR univer-
sal, despite how un-hipster they 
make make you seem. I’ve recently 
become quite nostalgic for myself 
(is that a thing?) and have been

ALBUM REVIEW

‘The Affair’ balances 
tone in season two

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

Over the course of the first 

season of “The Affair,” the series 
struggled to nail down what 
exactly its tone 
should be. The 
pilot, 
possibly 

the 
best 
epi-

sode, pulled it 
off better than 
any other epi-
sode. It was a 
slow-paced, 
atmospheric 
show 
based 

around 
an 

affair, 
filtered 

through the conflicting perspec-
tives of two lovers telling their 
story to the police. Each episode 
was essentially a pair of quiet, 
contemplative short stories, with 
a tantalizing crime mystery lurk-
ing in the background. As the 
season went on, “The Affair” 
focused a little too much on that 
overarching crime plot. By entic-
ing the audience with murder and 
melodrama, the slow pace of the 
personal drama became increas-
ingly dull.

Luckily, the season two pre-

miere of “The Affair” manages 
to recapture that precarious tone 
established by the pilot. Once 
again, there is a pair of under-
stated short stories that share 
many of the same events and 
characters, and once again, there 
is a future timeline focused on 
the characters dealing with the 
police. The balance is crucial; too 
much slow-paced teasing and the 
audience will grow tired of wheel-
spinning, but too much crime and 
bombast and the show will lose 
the intensely personal tone that 
makes it unique.

This year, instead of focusing 

exclusively on Noah Solloway 
(Dominic West, “The Wire”) 

and Alison Bailey (Ruth Wilson, 
“Saving Mr. Banks”), the series 
has added two new perspectives: 
those of Helen (Maura Tierney, 
“ER”) and Cole (Joshua Jackson, 
“Fringe”), the two spouses Noah 
and Alison betrayed by sleep-
ing together. The first half of the 
premiere shows a day in the life 
of Noah as he meets with Helen 
to finalize their divorce and deals 
with his children’s resentment 
towards him, only to return home 
to his happy relationship with 
Alison. The second half shows 
Helen’s perspective for the first 
time. Much like with Alison’s 
last year, it becomes obvious that 
Noah probably isn’t exactly the 
great guy the audience imagines 
him being.

In many dramas featuring infi-

delity and divorce, the exes are 
gradually phased out once their 
roles in the story are seemingly 
complete. In “Mad Men,” Betty 
and Megan’s episode counts 
were greatly reduced after their 
divorces from Don, and viewers 
recoiled whenever they made 
future appearances. Like “Break-
ing Bad,” however, “The Affair” 
benefits by taking the male lead’s 
victimized wife and giving her 
a more prominent, complex role 
in the narrative. Not only does 
Helen serve to pay for Noah’s 
expensive lawyer in the future 
timeline, but the audience finally 
gets a glimpse into her inner psy-
chology. The show gives a previ-
ously underdeveloped character 
a newfound agency.

Another great advantage to 

the addition of new perspectives 
is that it gives the show many 
more possible avenues to explore. 
When looked at as a whole, not 
much actually happened narra-
tively last year. Noah and Alison 
began an affair and ended up 
separating from their partners to 
be together. At some point in the 

future, we know that someone 
will kill Cole’s brother, Scotty 
(Colin Donnell, “Arrow”), and 
Noah will be suspected, probably 
because Scotty got his underage 
daughter Whitney (Julia Goldani 
Telles, “Bunheads”) pregnant. 
There were subplots, like Noah’s 
financial reliance on his disap-
proving in-laws and the writing of 
Noah’s new book, but most screen 
time was devoted either to Noah 
and Alison’s gradual romance or 
the sluggish telegraphing of Scot-
ty’s murder. So the introduction 
of two new perspectives hope-
fully indicates that the second-
ary characters will play more of a 
role, and that there’ll be a slightly 
deeper plot reserve to draw from 
in upcoming episodes.

More striking than the strong 

acting and naturalistic direction 
of “The Affair” is its pace and 
tone, which make it stand out in 
the TV landscape. Some viewers 
will inevitably be put off by long 
takes of people sitting motion-
lessly and silently contemplating 
their mistakes, but with these 
well-drawn characters, it’s fas-
cinating to watch them slowly 
work through their issues and fall 
again and again into patterns of 
self-sabotage. Helen has always 
been presented the same way, as 
an angry nuisance to Noah, but as 
she lies dejected during sex with 
new boyfriend Max (Josh Stam-
berg, “Parenthood”), it’s imme-
diately clear how much purpose 
her life has lost in the wake of 
Noah’s deceptions.

Like the first season, the second 

season of “The Affair” starts on a 
very solid note, striking a wise 
balance of character introspec-
tion and serialized crime story-
telling. As long as future episodes 
maintain that equilibrium and 
remain dedicated to the show’s 
exploration of memory bias, this 
season may surpass the first.

Blocking gets 
Ways on field

Redshirt freshman 

says he enjoys 
battles against 

opposing defenders

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Moe Ways smiles when he 

thinks about it. It’s a pleasant 
feeling, really.

The sensation comes late 

in games, after the Michigan 
football team’s wide receivers 
have blocked for the better part 
of 60 minutes. The redshirt 
freshman wide receiver looks 
across the field and sees a 
change in the opposing team’s 
cornerbacks and safeties.

“They slow down a little bit, 

they stop filling the hole quite 
as hard, they start to play off a 
little bit more,” Ways said.

The 
tendencies 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ 
receiving 
corps 

could be seen as irksome to 
opponents, a thorn in their 
sides. On multiple occasions 
this season, Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh has praised the 
group’s blocking for springing 
long runs.

Ways sees the frustration in 

his opponents. They comment 
on his position group’s blocking 
during games. The 6-foot-3, 
205-pound receiver indicated 
they are frequently needled 
and engage in 
a little bit of 
trash talk as a 
result.

“They 
say 

a little bit,” 
he said with a 
laugh.

The 
trash 

talk 
is 
the 

price of a job 
well done. The 
Wolverines’ 
rushing attack has become a 
constant threat, a dramatic 
change 
from 
recent 
years. 

Michigan had rushed for at 
least 200 yards in three straight 
contests before Saturday’s game 
against Maryland, when it fell 
just short with 198.

Though improved offensive 

line play has been at the 
forefront of the rejuvenated run 
game, the team’s wide receivers 
can be seen crushing bodies 
downfield on many of the team’s 
big gains on the ground.

Ways, perhaps more than 

the rest of Michigan’s wide 
receivers, 
has 
parlayed 
his 

blocking success into additional 
playing 
time. 
Harbaugh 

considers redshirt junior Jehu 
Chesson to be the best blocker 
of the team’s wide receivers. 
Ways and redshirt junior Amara 
Darboh round out Harbaugh’s 
top three.

But where Ways differs from 

Darboh and Chesson is that he 
has not yet established himself 
as a consistent pass catcher, at 
least not during games. Ways 
has one catch for 21 yards in the 
team’s first five games. Instead, 
his blocking has earned him 
playing time.

“Moe 
is 
really 
asserting 

himself,” Harbaugh said last 
week. “I think he’s climbing 
the depth chart right now. He 
just … he’s showing up in the 
play. On the down, he is finding 
somebody to block.”

Ways does not know exactly 

how he developed his blocking 
skills. He considers most of his 
success to be natural, a desire to 
be more physical than the guy 
lining up across from him.

In high school, Ways was 

more 
focused 
on 
catching 

passes. He could block a little 
bit, but when you catch 55 passes 
during your senior year, there 
isn’t much time for blocking.

When 
Ways 
came 
to 

Michigan, though, he felt he 
needed to uphold a tradition 
of excellence at running the 
ball. He did not see the field as 
a freshman, but felt ready to 
contribute any way he could 
this season. Ways was never told 
blocking was a path to seeing 
the field, but it worked out all 
the same. He was asked to block 
in certain packages and series, 
and he succeeded. He hasn’t 
looked back.

“As a group 

actually, 
we all want 
to 
be 
great 

blockers,” 
Ways 
said. 

“We 
take 

pride in that. 
We want to 
be known as 
one 
of 
the 

best blocking 
groups in the 

country, just help our team out, 
help the running backs keep 
getting loose.”

The players primarily charged 

with setting the running backs 
loose have noticed, too.

“When we run the ball inside 

and they come flying in and crack 
a safety or whatever it might be, 
it’s a fun thing to watch,” said 
sophomore offensive lineman 
Mason Cole. “They’re doing a 
really good job, and they work 
really hard at that.”

As Ways progresses in his 

career, he wants to be known as 
more than an excellent blocker. 

For now, though, as he 

works on the other aspects of 
playing the position, he can 
take solace when he looks at 
the man guarding him late in 
games. If his opponent shows 
the slightest bit of hesitation 
in any regard, it means he has 
done his job.

On another blank slate, 
Rudock uses old lessons

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

When Jake Rudock came 

to Michigan, much of what he 
found was new. He was in a new 
city, on a new team with new 
coaches and a new playbook.

Rudock 
transferred 
to 

Michigan from Iowa, where he 
started for the better part of the 
last two seasons. He arrived in 
Ann Arbor as a college graduate, 
but 
also 
as 
a 
newcomer. 

Fortunately for Rudock, he could 
take solace in the fact that he had 
been through the acclimation 
process before.

“It was similar feelings and 

memories of freshman year,” 
Rudock said. “But it was different 
enough, where you know you’ve 
had experience playing. I think 
that makes it a little bit easier, 
and I think it allows you to mesh 
better with the guys. And also, 
second time around, you have 
that familiarity with it. You’ve 
done it before. You’ve had to 
create new friends, create new 
relationships on the field.”

The first steps to assimilation 

came when Rudock arrived over 
the summer, and all the “new” 
started coming at him fast. 
He had to learn the plays and 
compete with returning junior 
Shane Morris, all while getting 
his bearings.

Rudock remembers calling his 

teammates “buddy” and “pal” 
while he continued to learn their 
names. He had to strike a balance 
this summer between being the 
new guy, but also playing the 
position most associated with 
leadership. He had to know his 
place, but also earn respect.

“I think one of the big things 

is the guys let you know,” Rudock 

said. 
“Maybe 
not 
verbally, 

but from their body language 
and how they react to things, 
they kind of let you know if, 
‘Hey, you’re overstepping your 
boundaries, you just got here.’ ”

Five games in, he appears to 

have earned the respect to lead 
his offense, as 
coaches 
and 

teammates 
speak 
positively 
about 
his 

even keel and 
leadership 
capabilities.

“He’s 
a 

great leader,” 
said 
redshirt 

freshman 
receiver Maurice Ways. “He’s 
not really a vocal leader, but 
when he talks, you listen.”

While 
he 
has 
quickly 

developed into the type of 

leader Michigan sought when 
it brought him in, there is still 
at least one aspect of his game 
that needs more time to flourish: 
chemistry with his wideouts.

At Iowa, Rudock wasn’t thrust 

into game action as a freshman, 
which gave him more time to 

grow into the 
offense and to 
perfect timing 
with receivers 
before 
he 

tested 
it 

against 
opponents. 
This 
season, 

Rudock 
took 

the first snap 
and 
every 

meaningful 

one since. And with limited time 
— Rudock called his acclimation 
process ‘accelerated’ — he has 
sometimes struggled to get on 
the same page with receivers.

He has missed on multiple 

deep balls, often overthrowing 
his receivers. That has led 
to criticism of the fifth-year 
senior, who was billed as a safe 
option coming into the season 
but has already thrown more 
interceptions (six) than he did 
in 12 games last season. His 
quarterback 
rating, 
117.4, 
is 

lower than in either of his two 
seasons as a starter.

But 
QB 
rating 
and 

interceptions aren’t the stats 
that Rudock uses to measure 
himself. This is his last year 
of college football, and if that 
means he gets stuck with the 
game-manager label, Rudock is 
just fine with that — as long as 
he’s winning.

“I’m OK with (only being 

measured by) wins and losses,” 
Rudock said. “The more wins, 
the better, and just let everything 
else take care of itself.”

All-Star big brother comes home

St. Louis Blues’ 

visit reconnects ‘M’ 
sophomore, former 

house guest

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

Niko Porikos rattles off the 

names of hockey players like an 
encyclopedia.

There’s the story about when 

he started playing hockey.

“It was class of ’05 — Nystrom, 

Gajic, Woodford,” Porikos said. 
“I was actually a soccer player. 
That was my No. 1 sport by far. 
They kind of brainwashed me 
into starting hockey, and ever 
since then, I’ve never looked 
back.”

Ask him about what he did 

for fun this summer, and more 
names flow out.

“There 
was 
a 
wedding, 

Milan Gajic, he got married in 
(Los Angeles),” Porikos said. 
“Went down with the family 
for a couple weeks, made a little 
vacation out of it.

“The first (NTDP player) we 

had was (Andrew) Vlassopoulos, 
played for Colorado College after 
USA. He’s living in (Los Angeles) 
and we visited him while we 
were down there.”

The Porikos family has been 

in and around Michigan hockey 
for Niko’s whole life. He grew 
up with aspiring NHL players 
roaming 
around 
the 
house, 

hosting four different National 
Talent Development Program 
players. Youth soccer star or 
not, Porikos was always going to 
grow up a hockey player.

The sophomore walk-on may 

know everyone in the phone 
book, but his smile portrays a bit 
of his excitement about the All-
Star he shared a house with this 
past weekend.

St. Louis Blues defenseman 

Kevin Shattenkirk headed to 
Ann Arbor last weekend as part 
of a team bonding trip, and 
didn’t waste an opportunity to 
spend time with the player he 
calls a little brother.

“I’ve been back plenty, still 

like to come and visit my old 
house,” Shattenkirk said. “We 
still keep in pretty close contact. 
It’s always cool to come back here 
and be able to see everyone.”

Added 
Porikos: 
“Saturday, 

I hung out with him for a few 
hours, just like old times. Just 
hung out on the couch watching 
TV.”

Host families, also known as 

billet families, are a common 
way for NTDP 
players, 
who 

live 
and 

train in Ann 
Arbor, to find 
housing 
as 

they play for 
America’s 
most 
prestigious 
junior 
hockey team. 
Shattenkirk 
and Porikos shared a house 
when Niko was in seventh and 
eighth grade.

“Pretty big years, hockey-

wise,” Porikos said. “I am an 
only child too, so growing up, it 
was cool having older guys in the 
house to look up to.”

It didn’t hurt that Shattenkirk 

was a first-rate player for the 
NTDP team, drafted 14th overall 
by the Colorado Avalanche in 
2007. In him and others, Porikos 
had older brothers to horse 
around with, and an inside look 
at what junior hockey is like at 
the highest level.

“There were a couple of skates 

where they had me come out and 
just mess around,” Porikos said. 
“(Shattenkirk) would come out 

to our team 
practices, 
too, once in a 
while. He was 
definitely into 
helping 
me 

out whenever 
I asked him 
anything 
about hockey 
or 
anything 

else.”

Shattenkirk 

played three years at Boston 
University and has played for 
the Blues since 2010. Coming off 
his first All-Star appearance, 
the 26-year-old was relaxed 
after practice in Ann Arbor 
alongside good friend Vladimir 
Tarasenko, 
who 
signed 
an 

eight-year deal with the team in 

the offseason.

“It’s really just nice to get 

away and have fun together,” 
Shattenkirk said. “We know 
that when we come to practice 
there are a lot of things we have 
to work on, and that for an hour 
and a half each day we have to 
put in the work. But for the most 
part, we’re here to get to know 
some of the new guys and come 
together and have some fun.”

Porikos 
is 
coming 
off 
a 

frustrating, 
injury-plagued 

year at Michigan. He still faces 
an uphill battle for a game-day 
roster spot, but he believes his 
timing and confidence have put 
him in a much better place this 
season.

Porikos and Shattenkirk try 

to see each other at least once a 
year, and Niko even went down 
to a Blues game with former 
Wolverine Dylan Larkin last 
spring.

There’s a story there too, of 

course. Larkin just made the 
Detroit Red Wings’ opening-day 
roster after leaving Michigan 
early, and will face Shattenkirk 
in St. Louis on Nov. 21. For now, 
though, Larkin joins Porikos’ 
ever-growing encyclopedia.

D

ear Emma,

I’m currently rushing 

and I was wondering if the 
sorority drama you hear about 
is true. Is that just the way 
Greek life is?

Thanks,

Drama Distaste

Hmm ... this one is tough. 
I’ll 
start 
by 
saying 
this: 

Moderation isn’t just good 
advice when it comes to 
chocolate. (I once threw up in 
the back of a movie theater in 
the fifth grade after our teacher 
handed out giant Hershey’s 
bars in class one day.) Your 
sorority can be an amazing 
part of your time at the 
University. I’m not Greek, but 
the interpersonal conflicts you 
are referring to are universal, I 
would think. As such, I would 
suggest you read this article 
from my friend Chloe Gilke, 
and keep in mind: you have 
agency 
over 
how 
engaged 

you are going to become with 
any drama that may occur, or 
really in any aspect of Greek 
life. I’d also add: don’t let Greek 
life be the only thing you do. 
Explore passions and interests 
outside of Greek life (and focus 
on classes!) so things like the 
sorority drama doesn’t take 
over your life. Also, it seems to 
me like rush might not give you 
a clear enough idea of what life 
post-bid day will actually look 
like, so give it some time, then 
empower yourself to quit if it 
really is just too dramatic for 
your taste.

Dear Emma,

I have the poster given to me by 
an old muse hanging above my 
bed, a few years after the whole 
calamity concluded. Am I stuck 
in the past?

Best,
Poster Puzzled

I have a hard and fast rule about 
these things: after a breakup, 
or even after it is clear feelings 
just aren’t mutual, that person 
ceases to exist. It’s childish, but 
effective. Snapchat, Facebook, 
teddy bears, even the shirt I 
wore on a date or something if 
I’m really hung up on someone 
— it all goes either into storage 
or into the garbage. The point 
isn’t to get a new wardrobe; it’s 
to hasten the recovery period. 
Things that make you dwell on 

that person, that relationship 
— or worse, trying to stay 
friends when one or both of 
you isn’t capable of being an 
actual friend — drag out your 
emotional attachment to a 
person who is not right for 
you, for whatever reason. I’d 
say it’s time to take it down, if 
only because here you are, a 
few years after the relationship 
ended, still talking about her. 
Buy yourself a new poster, or 
accept that this person will 
always have a little place in 
your life, and that’s ok too. Or 
better, find a new gal to help 
you spice up your apartment 
walls with decorations.

You’ve got 99 problems, send

THOUGHT BUBBLE


The time is upon us: Whether you are a senior searching 

for a way to sustain a living after graduation, or a 

freshman looking to build that resume, career fair brings 

feelings of pain and fear to us all. We came up with five 

types you are guaranteed to find at every career event 

— this is what they are thinking, though they probably 

won’t be saying it.

3B

THE LIST

THE GO-GET TER
“I’ve already taken another job offer, I just came here 
to watch other people squirm.”

THE HONEST ONE
“I know nothing about your company — I just live in 
constant fear of living in my parent’s basement after 
graduation.”

THE FUN ONE
“I’m incredibly hungover from Skeeps last night. 
After I give you my resume I’m going to go vomit in 
the Union restroom.”

TO FAIR OR NOT TO FAIR

THE DREAMER
“I’m woefully under-qualified for this position, but if I 
act confident enough maybe you won’t notice.”

THE LEGACY
“This conversation is just a formality, as my uncle 
is a VP at your company and I’m a shoo-in for this 
position.”

Don’t look at my Spotify

I

’ve heard from my friends — 
an alarming number of times 
— that if they’re ever in need 

of a good laugh, they go and look at 
my Spotify account. It’s not even 
the names of the playlists, they say 
— it’s what’s in them.

I’ve always been known to have 

an eclectic taste in music, to say 
the least. The sight of an Indian-
American kid from the Bay Area 
with an amateur beard listening 
to Jagged Edge must be jarring 
for anyone, but it’s apparently 
provided ample comedic fodder 
for my friends. Prompted to 
answer the question, “What kind 
of music do you listen to?” I always 
accompany my response with 
an, “It’s kind of weird, but…” or 
“Actually, I don’t like EDM, but 
instead…” It’s not a fun addition 
to a conversation, but one I feel 
is necessary to prevent an early 
departure from the other camp.

I 
watched 
“Straight 
Outta 

Compton” this summer. The scene 
in which a crowd full of white kids 
reciting violent, racially charged 
lyrics word-for-word made me 
think. For Black people, this music 

was revolutionary. For white kids, 
this music was just hella cool. I 
began to wonder if I was guilty of 
the same appropriation.

I love listening to R. Kelly 

and Chris Brown (questionable 
people, 
unquestionably 
great 

music). I can quote lyrics off the 
dome from Boyz II Men’s II (“On 
Bended Knee” is probably the 
best track). And I also know the 
unfortunate fact that Keith Sweat 
hosts a festival called SweatFest 
(dates for 2016 haven’t been 
announced yet). R&B, however, 
is just as rooted in African-
American culture as is hip-hop, 
just as important to Black identity 
as is gangsta rap, but with a 
different intent.

Nineties R&B is more sensual 

than 
modern 
music, 
more 

interested in vocal range and 
ability than dance-friendly beats. 
Jazz, funk, and blues are the 
backbone of the style. The lyrics 
are often full of cheesy, on-the-
nose wordplay about genitals 
instead of the profundity that is 
“I wanna be like Kanye.” It’s also 
very awkward when I 

play this kind of stuff aloud in my 
apartment. Is it wrong for me to 
like this? Am I allowed to?

There’s an inherent weirdness, 

I know, to the concept of an Indian 
kid playing Marvin Gaye aloud in 
his dorm room. Race and music 
have always been inextricably 
linked, and the conversation is 
still ongoing. But most of this 
conversation 
is 
about 
those 

creating the music, and not the 
ones listening to it.

After watching Dr. Dre say, 

“Aftermath” to Suge Knight’s 
face, and while I was staring at 
the credits rolling, questioning 
my entire Spotify profile, I tried to 
placate myself by saying, At least 
I don’t use the n-word. But that’s 
superficial. I realize it’s more 
than that — it’s recognizing and 
respecting what this aspect of a 
long-suppressed culture means, 
what its history is, what I’m 
really listening to when I listen to 
D’Angelo’s Black Messiah. I think, 
at least, that I can like it. And I do.

And Mariah Carey is the best 

recording artist of all time.

S

tudents clad in finely pressed black suits and 
professional dresses walked briskly around the 
Michigan Union at the first day of the Career 

Center’s annual Fall Career Expo Tuesday.

About 
1,600 
students, 
wearing 
their 
most 

impressive attire, fill nearly every room of the Union. 
Walking through the lobby, groups can be heard 
chatting about their previous internship experience 
and their job goals for next summer.

Among them, Business junior Kristin Green sat on 

a bench outside the reading room.

“I am building up my confidence to talk to 

companies for tomorrow so I just walked around,” she 
said, herself wearing a white dress and heels.

The Business School hosts daily recruiting events 

on campus. But Green doesn’t see herself working 
at one of the companies that most eagerly recruit 
students on campus. She says she would feel lost at a 
large corporation.

Most rooms were packed with students who 

were both nervous and eager for their turn to try 
impressing a recruiter, with some long lines spilling 
into the hallways. Many students not waiting in line 
were either leaned against a wall scribbling down 
notes or slipping their feet out of flip flops and into 
black heels.

“Were you planning on talking to recruiters 

today?” I asked Green.

“I was thinking about it,” she laughed in response. 

“But, I don’t know… I’m just working on my confidence. 
I got all dressed up — it took me a while — but I don’t 
know. I just wanted to scope things out … Tomorrow 
there are a lot more (companies) on my list.”

 ***

Though the semester has just begun, students are 

already under the gun to land a “perfect” summer 
internship or, if graduating, an elusive, full-time job 
offer.

That’s where the Expo comes in.
The event, which has been in the works for the 

past two years, features 185 organizations — about 29 
more than last year — with 90 companies recruiting 
on Tuesday and 95 different companies today. Many 
of the participating organizations return to campus 
after the two-day event or stay for an interview day 
on Thursday.

For students hoping to secure a job or internship, 

the Fall Expo is one of the Career Center’s biggest 
events to get students to connect with recruiters. Last 
year about 25,000 students attended the Expo, and 
according to Career Center director Karin Borland, 
attendance has increased each year by about 500 
students.

While various organizations host other specialized 

career fairs throughout the year, the Career Center 
says it gears its Expo to all University students 
regardless of year or major. Sally Schueneman, the 
Career Center’s career events manager, notes about 
85 percent of this year’s visiting organizations are 
open to all majors.

But that message may be lost on some, as student 

organizations and University offices outside of LSA — 
specifically the Engineering and Business schools — 
have developed specialized resources for career and 
internship guidance.

***

Ever since Engineering junior Ted Xiao spent 

this past summer interning at Optimal CAE Inc., an 
automotive supplier, he has been actively trying to 
meet recruiters and network a new opportunity for 
next summer.

Since classes began the first week of September, he 

and his classmates have had constant recruiting and 
information sessions, many of which entice students 
with food in addition to the networking opportunity. 
Though Xiao said he has so far only attended around 
five information sessions, he said many students 
attend at least two a day.

“If you play your cards right you don’t have to pay 

for food for like three weeks,” Xiao said, referencing 
the number of midday and evening events offered.

While the Career Center Expo hosts companies 

offering some positions for students pursuing 
engineering jobs, many engineering students instead 
focus their energy the Engineering Career Fair, which 
was held on North Campus last Monday and Tuesday.

The engineering fair, hosted annually since 1986 

by the Society of Women Engineers and Tau Beta Pi, 
the National Engineering Honor Society, boasts that 
it is the University’s largest career fair. With 340 
companies and over 4,200 students in attendance, the 
student-run event took over almost every engineering 
building. (Though it should also be noted that some of 
the participating companies at the engineering career 
fair make a second appearance at the Fall Expo.)

Engineering professors are aware of the all-day, 

two-day fair and understand that many students may 
not be in class. Almost everyone wears a suit, many 
with a pin indicating the wearer’s major on the lapel.

“Homework this week is kind of out the window,” 

Xiao said. “It’s only a few days so it’s not going to kill 
you ... for the most part.”

Engineering junior Eddie Godbold attended both 

events — the engineering fair and the Fall Expo. 
Though he said there were more opportunities for 
engineering students at last week’s fair, the Expo 
allowed him make a second impression at some of his 
favorite organizations.

“The only reason I really came is because I’m 

considering maybe an opportunity outside of just 
purely engineering and there’s a couple companies 
here that were at both,” Goldbold said. “I just wanted 
to follow up and show that I’m very interested in their 
companies.”

***

With so many companies and so many students 

waiting in line for their turn to impress a recruiter, 
students know they must come armed with their 
resume, an “elevator pitch” and a strategy. Research 
and preparation on the companies they plan to 
approach are key.

Four days before the Career Center hosted the Fall 

Expo, it offered the “Great Expo-Prep-Tacular,” an 
all-day opportunity for students to prepare for the 
career fair with drop-in career advising and mini 
clinics. Additional events were offered in the weeks 
prior.

The Career Center hosted a similar program last 

year. This year, in addition to featuring staple events 
focusing on what to expect at the career fair and how 
to speak and follow up with employers, the program 
included a session focused on freshman opportunities 

at the fair.

Tyler 
Wang, 
a 
Career 
Center 
recruitment 

coordinator, led a clinic advising students the best 
ways to speak with recruiters.

“Students really want a prescription for how to be 

successful,” she said. “They want to know, ‘What do I 
say? How much time do I have to say it and how many 
people should I talk to?’ ”

“Really the advice we give is that there’s not just 

one cookie cutter way to be successful at the career 
fair,” she said. “What we want is for students to be 
able to make a genuine connection with an employer 
and be able to take that connection to the next level by 
getting an internship or a job.”

LSA senior Ali Miesel said she found the pre-Expo 

preparation extremely helpful. She hoped to take 
advantage of the opportunities provided to get an 
interview.

“I definitely have a lot of preparation to do (before 

the Expo) but coming here gave me ideas on how to do 
that,” Miesel said on Friday.

In addition to the prep day, the Career Center 

hosted another event Monday evening for students to 
ask additional questions and meet alumni returning 
as recruiters in a more informal “speed-networking” 
styled setting.

“Our goal is to help students be successful,” Wang 

said. “If students are looking for an internship or a job 
or if they’re just trying to figure out what they want to 
do with their lives, we want to provide them with all 
the tools and resources necessary to help accomplish 
that goal. That’s really our job: to help students.”

***

Borland said she thinks the Expo has a reputation 

for 
featuring 
many 
corporate 
opportunities. 

However, she emphasized that there are a wide 
range of jobs, including opportunities in investment 
banking, consulting, marketing, HR and at large 
corporations, as well as opportunities to work at non-
profit organizations and government agencies.

“There are what I call the hidden gems,” Borland 

said.

Though Public Policy junior Heidi Payter spent her 

time at the Expo talking to two organizations, she 
said she didn’t feel like there were many participating 
companies that met her interests.

“They do a lot of stuff at Ford and I feel like they 

help me more than this did, but it was still useful.” 
Payter said. “I used it for practice so when I have to 
do one for a scary business that I really want to work 
at, then I’m ready.”

For students who may not find their interests 

represented at the Expo, Borland said not every 
career industry lends itself to the career fair set up.

“It really reflects how different career fields do 

their recruiting,” Borland said.

Since the Expo is considered a first step in the 

internship process, the Career Center does not have 
data determining how many students are eventually 
able to procure an internship through connections 
made at the career fair.

However, Schueneman said the center does try to 

keep tabs on where graduating seniors first end up 
after college. She said about 93 percent of students 
end up at either their first choice of job or graduate 
school post-graduation.

Staking Your Claim:

How students tackle the job search process


Wednesday, October 7, 2015 // The Statement
6B

by Samiha Matin, Daily Staff Reporter

I

’m a reason why the University can proudly declare they 
have students coming from more than 140 countries 
or more. I’m one of the many, many people which 

helps make this place have a global, diverse community — 
simply because I come from another place. I’m the token 
friend who you tell stories about to your other friends from 
high school. The friend from the exotic place. The friend 
whose nationality is more important than her personality, 
it occasionally seems.

I remember when I was the only one standing in an 

auditorium of 500 or more international students, as 
they called out “Bangladesh” during the International 
Orientation Program. There was a typical scatter of 
applause; some people, however, looked mildly curious, as 
if trying to wonder where my country was located. I blindly 
searched across the auditorium, desperately hoping for 
another face like mine. There wasn’t.

We were told during orientation that from now on, we 

were going to be representing our countries at Michigan. A 
foreboding chill ran down my spine as I realized the impact 
of the sentence. I’d stepped into America for the first time 
in my life two days before. I’d only ever gone abroad twice, 
and both times were for religious pilgrimages to Saudi 
Arabia nearly six years ago. I was undecided about my 
major. I’d hardly ever eaten with a fork. What I knew about 
American culture was everything I’d learned by watching 
television and movies.

How could I, when I barely knew what to do with my life 

and constantly suffered from existential crisis, represent 
a country that consisted of a variety of people? How could 
they expect me to be excited about such a big burden? It was 
almost as if living up to a good image and become a minority 
model was the only way I could make my mark here.

When I moved into my apartment last year, I didn’t 

know what to expect. On one hand, I’d heard stories from 
other Bangladeshi expatriates, who talked about how 
the transition was immensely difficult due to the racist 
treatment they had received. I’d also heard that it wasn’t 

true in most occasions, and people had a tendency to 
embellish stories to gain sympathy.

I dragged my luggage into the room after the family who 

had sheltered me for a night since coming to Ann Arbor 
dropped me off, a piteous look upon their faces.

That night, my roommate commented that I must be very 

rich and privileged to be able to afford to come here from 
far away. The same thing was said by many other students 
in my classes, when they realized I was an international 
student.

I frowned, not because what they said wasn’t true, but 

because of the condescending tone they would sometimes 
use to say it. As if I was a filthy rich kid from a third-world 
country, wasting her parents’ money by getting a foreign 
degree. As if I had so much money stashed up somewhere 
that I was drowning in it.

I glanced at the clothes I wore, and wondered about the 

jeans and T-shirts I’d bought from Bangladesh. I’d never 
buy anything from here, I decided, because when you 
converted dollars to the currency used in my country, it 
accumulated to an exorbitant sum of money. I had no desire 
for brand clothes or makeup; I couldn’t even afford them. I 
had brought my brother’s used luggage into my apartment, 
and piled all my clothes there when I was packing. 

It didn’t seem as if my attire played any part in giving 

people such an impression. Was it simply because I came 
from a place that I’d gotten hurdled by these assumptions?

Another setback came when my roommates and I 

divided the chores of cleaning the bathrooms and taking 
out the trash. I found my roommate making a comment 
along the lines that I had probably not done them and I’d 
better do them now, as Bangladeshi households, along with 
many countries in Asia, hired domestic workers. I wanted 
to tell her that it wasn’t the case in all families, and there 
were many friends and relatives I knew who’d pay for the 
servants’ education, and even their marriages, as my father 
and uncles do. I wanted to tell her that such a system existed 
because majority of the people didn’t have access to good 

jobs, education, health care and working at houses gave 
them something to get by. I wanted to engage with her, and 
ask her why she was holding me responsible for a system 
that had been circulating for centuries. I couldn’t hold her 
accountable for mistakes politicians made here; why was 
she doing the same thing to me?

But I couldn’t. I felt a strong sense of dual identity that 

prevented me from saying another word. On one hand, 
I was a Michigan student, who had received the most 
amazing resources and opportunities my friends at home 
would die to have for. I have my parents’ financial support 
for undergraduate studies, and the only way I could repay 
them back was doing exceptionally well in academics and 
extracurricular activities and get into grad school.

At orientation, I was told, almost compellingly, to give 

a good image of my country. And yet, it gets harder to put 
on a smile and never getting the chance to explain that I’m 
experiencing a double standard.

My status as a Michigan student is firmly tied to the fact 

that I am international. I’m not eligible for any type of aid or 
scholarships. I’m a citizen of a country, which is famous for 
corruption, political instability and religious extremism. I 
cannot go home for the next three years, because tickets 
are too expensive. All my free time involves juggling 
two jobs, and looking into prospective summer jobs and 
internships so that I can save up and go to graduate school. 
I’m constantly watching my parents’ resources deplete into 
nothingness as they make sure I get the best education. In 
my country, I never walked alone at night. In my country, 
I’ve been molested and dealt with misogyny that’s a 
thousand times worse than here. I’ve been told there’s no 
value in education, and I’ve watched society try to heave its 
sexist views onto me time after time.

I’m both privileged and unprivileged in many aspects, 

but I’m more than a statistic to proudly display. I’m more 
than a stereotype formed about students coming from 
obscure places. I’m more than the product of the society I 
grew up in, and I hope this is acknowledged someday.

optiMize: Saving the world, one idea at a time

E

rin Johnson had just moved into her dorm room at 
Bursley and found her way around campus when 
she saw a poster: “ ‘Why not me?’ Stop waiting 

for someone else to change the world.” The poster for the 
student organization optiMize would ultimately chart the 
course for her time at the University.

A year later Johnson, a sophomore studying business and 

international studies, is president of the organization. She 
said prior to joining optiMize she had minimal experience 
in entrepreneurship, but the passion and support from 
members of the organization inspired her.

“ ‘Stop waiting for someone else to change the world’ — 

seeing that phrase come to life, that’s probably why I got so 
involved,” she said.

Since 2012, optiMize has helped students with social 

innovation ideas make them a reality. The programs pairs 
student-entrepreneurs with experienced mentors, and 
offers $100,000 in prize money to the student groups that 
advocate for their ideas most successfully. The top five 
teams each win $5,000 in funding to create their design. The 
projects are funded primarily through donor money, but the 
group also receives funding from LSA

Mentors can come from all backgrounds: “near peer” 

mentors are students who have previously participated in 
the program, while older mentors from LSA, alumni, and 
entrepreneurs in the Ann Arbor community.

“Maybe someone has an idea but they have no idea how 

to get started, or no idea how to put it into action,” Johnson 
said. “Everyone has the soft skills; the mentors come in and 
really help them with the hard skills: how exactly are you 
going to implement this, how exactly are you going to take 
this idea and like what channel are you going to go through, 

who are you really going to market to?”

Last year ADAPT — a core team composed of Engineering 

junior Laura Murphey and Art & Design senior Sidney 
Krandall — won the competition by creating an umbrella 
attachment for wheelchairs.

The team met at an optiMize “speed dating” event, which 

pairs students interested in participating but do not have a 
partner or a clear idea yet with others in the same boat. One 
of members came up with their idea when she visited the 

Ann Arbor Veteran’s Association hospital and asked what 
the patients needed. It’s this kind of problem solving Erin 
loves.

“That’s the coolest thing I think about optiMize is that 

when people notice a problem, they can follow through, and 
we provide them with the resources to actually take that 
idea or the problem that they saw and help them along the 
solution,” she said. “Seeing people go and take real world 
experience and being like ‘I’m going to change that, that’s 
not that hard to change’ like making an accessory for a 
wheelchair — that improves so many people’s lives, that 
makes so much of a positive impact, but all you had to do 
was figure out how you’re going to attach an umbrella to a 
wheelchair.”

Since last year, ADAPT has used its winnings to expand 

and become a real company working on several other 
attachments for wheelchairs, and to improve disabled 
people’s lives.

For people like Johnson, it’s these success stories and 

the reach optiMize has that keeps her passionate about the 
organization.

“As soon as I got there I knew this was (a good fit for 

me), because I have a lot of experience with community 
service, and stuff like that, but it was always like a one on 
one basis — I tutored this person after school, I do this, I 
do this — but like I never felt like the work I was doing was 
making an impact on the community as a whole,” she said. 
“Being able to even help someone take their idea and even 
play the smallest part in helping them make that dream, that 
passion, into something real. That was the most rewarding 
thing for me.”

As president, Johnson hopes to share her positive 

experience with as many people as possible and spread 
optiMize’s message that there doesn’t have to be a tradeoff 
between work and life. She believes in this message so much 
that after graduation, Erin would like to work somewhere 
with the same principles as optiMize.

“People talk about concepts of work-life balance a lot, 

and what we want to show people is that just because you’re 
doing something to make a living doesn’t mean you can’t be 
passionate about it,” Johnson said. “Doing what you love 
and going to work everyday — they don’t have to be these 
two mutually exclusive things. The more overlap your life 
passions have with what you do on a daily basis — that’s 
what it should be.”

What took me seconds to swipe with 

a green paintbrush on the world map I 
painted for the literacy center took an hour 
of a bumpy and at times terrifying ride from 
the foothills of the Himalayas into the faces 
of the mountains. We weren’t even close to 
the top, but still at times I had the feeling 
we were at the cusp of the world, and all 
that was keeping me from a free fall to the 
bottom was the balance I’d acquired from 
our morning yoga sessions. The goats we 
encountered on our drive up the mountain 
seemed to be masters of this, as they 
climbed up seemingly ninety-degree cliff 
faces.

I have climbed the Sierra Nevadas of 

Spain, the Appenninos of Italy, and just 
this spring, the Appalachians of our home 
country, but the stark monstrosity that is 
the Himalayas was something I had never 
experienced. A journey up one side of the 
monster, and we seemed to be on top of the 
world. The layer of smog and smoke over 
the sprawling city of Dehra Dun looked 
like a surreal mist nestled in a fold of the 
foothills. The quick incline from the rolling 
hills made it seem like we were just floating 
in the clouds over the city. Even more 
amazing than the view was the fact that 
after a while we started to encounter the 
villages in these mountains. Little homes 
were perched just as precariously as the 
goats on the edges of the cliffs. The purpose 
of our excursion was to meet, speak with, 
and bring supplies to the women working 
for ANKURI that live in one of the mountain 
villages, Rikholi.

ANKURI is an organization promoting 

the long-term independence of village 
women through craft-making. Through

financial independence, they are able 
to gain agency in many other aspects 
of their life. ANKURI is such an inviting 
and accommodating experience for the 
women. It allows them to dip their feet 
into the workforce and see what financial 
freedom tastes like. Many are inspired for 
their children to succeed even further, and 
it gives the kids the chance to see how their 
mother is empowered by working. This 
initiative will help to foster an environment 
of independence in the village for the future 
generations as well. 

The isolation of the community makes 

it even more difficult for women to hold a 
job. Their husbands are already traveling a 
distance to the tourist town of Missouri to 
work, which leaves the women at home. 
ANKURI is unique because the owner, 
Rachna, understands the wool must be 
brought to them. Barriers of transportation 
already bar them from other work, so with 
ANKURI they have one less challenge to 
being a working woman and supporting a 
family.

These women come from similar 

backgrounds, 
yet 
they 
are 
diverse 

individuals. 
However, 
many 
of 
the 

environmental factors working against 
them are similar. Abusive husbands, lack of 
safe job availability, cultural norms, families 
that have married them to husbands miles 
and miles away, and the pressure of caring 
for a family all impact the power they 
possess over themselves and their family. 
Knitting brings them together, and forms a 
community of powerful women.
