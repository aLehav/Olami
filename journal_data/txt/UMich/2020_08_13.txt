T

here may finally be some 
clarity 
surrounding 
college football.
After a meeting on 
Tuesday morning, Big 
Ten Presidents and Chancellors voted to 
postpone fall sports.
“The mental and physical health and 
welfare of our student-athletes has been 
at the center of every decision we have 
made regarding the ability to proceed 
forward,” Big Ten Commissioner Kevin 
Warren said. “As time progressed and 
after hours of discussion with our Big 
Ten Task Force for Emerging Infectious 
Diseases and the Big Ten Sports Medicine 
Committee, it became abundantly clear 
that there was too much uncertainty 
regarding potential medical risks to 

allow our student-athletes to compete 
this fall.”
Men’s 
and 
women’s 
soccer 
and 
cross country, field hockey, volleyball 
and football will all be affected by the 
decision.
The unprecedented move comes in 
times dominated by confusion. The 
decision was made a day after the Big Ten 
refuted multiple reports that the college 
Presidents of the conference voted to 
cancel fall athletics over the weekend. 
Reports are that the PAC-12 will follow 
the Big Ten’s path and postpone its 
season, with hopes of a Spring season for 
the sports affected.
“For the second time in five months, 
the Big Ten Conference made the 
unfortunate but necessary decision to 
postpone an athletic season in order to 
protect the health and well-being of our 
student-athletes, staff, and community 
members,” Michigan athletic directory 
Warde Manuel said in a release Tuesday. 
“As a result, all fall sport schedules have 
been postponed. This latest decision was 
reached after careful consideration and 
the grim knowledge that this pandemic 
continues 
to 
affect 
our 
country 
adversely. I am deeply saddened for our 
student-athletes and remain committed 
to our ongoing promise to provide them 
with a world-class education. We remain 
grateful to our global Michigan family 
for their unwavering support.”
The decision to cancel contradicts the 
wishes of its players and coaches, who 
took to Twitter Sunday to tweet support 
for playing football. Jim Harbaugh on 
Monday released a statement in support 
of playing football, saying his program 
has been able to limit the spread of 
COVID-19. Nebraska coach Scott Frost 
said Nebraska will explore every option 
to play football, even if the Big Ten votes 
to cancel.
“Our football team, our coaching staff, 
our support stadd in Schembechler Hall 
have all stepped up, followed every rule, 
and done everything in their power 
magnificently to give all the opportunity 
to compete,” Harbaugh’s new statement 
on Tuesday said. “I am extremely 
proud, thankful and appreciative of 
our team and how they have conducted 
and represented our program and 
university.”
A spokesperson for the football 
team told The Daily that the team will 
continue to hold voluntary practices, 
meetings and strength and conditioning 
for 20 hours per week, including practice 
on Tuesday. The statement released by 
athletic director Warde Manuel says that 

all athletic activities will be suspended 
immediately, including practices. The 
Daily was told that line will change 
on the announcement, as the Big Ten 
cleared Michigan to work under the 
20-hour rule.
University President Mark Schlissel 
released 
a 
statement 
on 
Twitter 
supporting the decision to postpone, in 
contrast with Harbaugh.
“I fully support the difficult Big 
Ten decision to postpone fall athletics 
competition,” Schlissel wrote. “There are 
too many poorly understood health and 
safety concerns unique to intercollegiate 
athletics to move forward with practices 
and competition at present -- and the 
impact of extreme physical exertion on 
the health risk of COVID-19 has not been 
well-assessed.
“I join athletic director Warde Manuel 
and everyone at Michigan Athletics 
in expressing my empathy to all who 
were looking forward to competing, 
coaching, 
supporting 
and 
cheering 
us on as members of the Wolverine 
family. I particularly feel badly for our 
student-athletes who gain so much from 
participation in their sports and are 
such outstanding representatives of the 
university. We will work hard to return 
them safely to competition.”
The delay gives both America and 
colleges time to contain the spread of the 
virus and adjust to the return of students, 
one of the biggest hurdles that still faces 
colleges trying to return safely and 
educate its students. In order for there to 
be sports, first the student population on 
campus must be healthy and the Big Ten 
needs to know the impact that students 
have on the numbers of COVID-19 cases.
“While I know our decision today will 
be disappointing in many ways for our 
thousands of student-athletes and their 
families,” Warren said, “I am heartened 
and inspired by their resilience, their 
insightful and discerning thoughts, 
and their participation through our 
conversations to this point. Everyone 
associated with the Big Ten Conference 
and its member institutions is committed 
to getting everyone back to competition 
as soon as it is safe to do so.”
Time, right now, is all the Big Ten 
has that can make the possibility of any 
sports a reality, something that schools 
across the country have been trying to 
get more of throughout the summer as 
the decision has been delayed time and 
time again. Now, it has until spring to 
make a the final decision.

Big Ten votes to postpone 
Fall sports season

Decision reached following multiple 
days of speculation


In an email to students and fac-
ulty Monday, University of Mich-
igan President Mark Schlissel 
outlined the new interim policy 
on sexual and gender-based mis-
conduct, which will go into effect 
Aug 14. The policy will apply to 
students, faculty, staff and third 
parties on all three campuses and 
Michigan Medicine.
“Improving how we prevent 
and address sexual and gender-
based misconduct in our com-
munity must always remain a 
foremost priority at U-M,” Schlis-
sel said. “We strive to do better, 
always, and creating an umbrella 
policy that covers all members of 
the U-M community is one key 
measure we are implementing.”
The policy includes definitions 
for prohibited conduct, separate 
procedures for addressing allega-
tions against students and allega-
tions against employees or third 
parties, and clarifies confiden-
tial resources and ways to report 
misconduct. 
This policy, which was ori-
ginally set to be released in early 
2020, was postponed in order to 
take the Department of Educa-
tion’s new regulations into con-
sideration. The new regulations, 
announced in May by Secre-
tary of Education Betsy DeVos, 
announced new title IX proced-
ures and protocol which will 
change the policy draft shared by 
University administration in the 
fall. 
According to the University 
Record, one of the most signifi-
cant changes is the new federal 
regulations having a more nar-
row definition for sexual harass-
ment. 
Rather than the previous def-
inition, which said sexual harass-
ment is conduct that is “severe, 
persistent, or pervasive,” the 
new definition says it is conduct 
which is so “severe and pervasive 
and objectively offensive that it 
effectively denies a person equal 

access to education.”
The new University policy 
includes a definition of Title IX 
regulations to meet federal regu-
lations, as well as a broader def-
inition that includes sexual and 
gender-based misconduct out-
side of federal regulations. It also 
includes two separate procedures 
for staff, faculty and third par-
ties, depending on which defin-
ition the allegation falls under.
The 
policy 
also 
retained 
reporting 
obligations, 
despite 
federal regulations removing ref-
erences and requirements related 
to responsible employees. Indi-
viduals with reporting obliga-
tions are identified and obligated 
to report information regarding 
prohibited conduct to the Office 
of Institutional Equity.
For 
students, 
new 
federal 
regulations also require that 
cross examinations be held by a 
student’s adviser. These advisers 
can be outside attorneys provid-
ed by the University for students 
who need them.
Public Policy junior Emma 
Sandberg is the executive dir-
ector of Roe v. Rape, a nonprofit 
organization that advocates for 
sexual assault survivors. In an 
interview with The Daily, Sand-
berg emphasized the policy chan-
ges announced by Schlissel are a 
huge improvement over previous 
policies. 
“One thing that we have been 
advocating for throughout the 
past year is for the University to 
provide students with free attor-
neys, rather than advisors for 
cross examination,” Sandberg 
said. “According to the Univer-
sity Record, it looks like U of M 
has this demand in their policy 
changes, which is a major win for 
survivors.”
According to Sandberg, the 
group was also glad to see the 
University maintain the prepon-
derance of evidence standard and 
continue to investigate off cam-
pus sexual misconduct, both of 
which were not required under 
the new federal regulations. Both 
of these were among the seven 
demands made by a petition that 
circulated in May regarding the 
new regulations.

‘U’ updates sexual 
misconduct policy

The University of Michigan prides 
itself on being one of the nation’s 
top public research universities. 
Across all three campuses, 20,540 
graduate students and 8,598 faculty 
members study and work at the 
University, many of whom are 
active in research. In addition, over 
1,500 undergraduates participate 
in the Undergraduate Research 
Opportunity Program at the Ann 
Arbor campus.
Despite 
the 
thousands 
of 
researchers, 
the 
University’s 
anonymous 
reporting 
system 
received only seven reports in 
2019 related to “issues arising in 
the research setting,” according 
to University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen.
A Michigan Daily investigation 
found that flaws in the system 
deterred student researchers from 
reporting alleged abuse. The Daily 
spoke to three students who claimed 
the small size of their lab prevented 
them from using the University’s 
reporting system to report alleged 
misconduct. The Daily also found 
that little oversight of research 
supervisors 
strengthens 
the 
hierarchical system in research labs. 
Jason Altom, a graduate student 
in Harvard University’s chemistry 
department, died by suicide in 
1998. Two of the three suicide notes 

Altom left called for changes to the 
department that he felt could have 
prevented his death.
“Professors here have too much 
power over the lives of their grad 
students,” Altom wrote in one of his 
notes.
After 
extensive 
coverage 
by 
The New York Times, Harvard’s 
chemistry department adopted a 
series of changes, including a three-
member 
committee 
to 
monitor 
student 
researcher 
progress 
and free, confidential access to a 
therapist. Since Altom’s passing, 
journalists have uncovered alleged 
research abuse at other institutions 
like Stanford University and the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
In a report released last month, 
WilmerHale, the law firm hired 
to investigate former University 
of Michigan Provost Martin A. 
Philbert’s 
sexual 
misconduct 
allegations, 
found 
he 
harassed 
women, including graduate students 
who worked in his research lab. 
Philbert made comments about their 
bodies, 
redireced 
conversations 
toward sex and insisted on receiving 
hugs.
In 2005, specific allegations of 
sexual assault arose in which one 
of Philbert’s research assistants 
reported Philbert had “asked her 
for sex, to marry him, to run away 
together and to ‘have caramel (sic) 
colored babies’ with him.” The report 
found “significant evidence that 
Philbert engaged in a wide range of 
sexual misconduct, including sexual 
harassment, for at least fifteen years.”

Abuse in research 
goes unreported

 Students allege 
ineffective filing system 
due to major flaws

The new regulations 
set to take effect 
on Aug. 14


As the Michigan Union reopened 
Monday morning for the second 
time this calendar year, University 
of Michigan alumni Isabel Wil-
liams, Amanda Wasserman and 
Lucy Rosenthal stopped to say 
goodbye. The trio, who met their 
freshman year, roamed the silent, 
empty halls, reminiscing on game 
days and late-night food runs 
together one last time before their 
senior year housing lease ends later 
this week.
“It’s definitely very sad look-
ing not seeing everyone else run-
ning around here,” Rosenthal said. 
“I think everyone was so excited 
to explore the new spaces and see 
what this building had to offer, 
because they put so much time and 
money into making this a great 
place for student events.”
When the Union opened its doors 
Jan. 13 after a two-year, $85 million 
renovation, students were greeted 
with a 500-person line, food trucks 
and a ceremony with a speech from 
University President Mark Schlis-
sel.
That same day, a woman in 
Thailand was hospitalized with 
a “novel pneumonia virus” — the 
first known COVID-19 case outside 
China. The century-old building, 
where John F. Kennedy introduced 
the Peace Corps and Martin Luther 
King Jr. met with student leaders, 
closed its doors only three months 
later. When students come back to 
campus in the weeks, physical dis-
tancing and face covering require-
ments will be in place. The contrast 
between the Union’s reopenings 
strikes Rosenthal. 
“It could not be more different,” 
Rosenthal said.
Thinking back to simpler times, 
Williams passed by the old Sweet-
waters location and remembered 
milestones of her four years in Ann 
Arbor.
“I was like, this is where I had 
this meeting, and this is where I 
booked that flight, and this is where 
I studied for that test,” Williams 

said. 
Yet as Wasserman scanned the 
one-person tables and spread apart 
chairs in the north study room, she 
worried about incoming students 
getting the same college experience 
they had. 
“Even studying wise, like going 
somewhere to study with a bunch 
of friends or getting a study room, 
I don’t know how that’s gonna work 
anymore,” Wasserman said. 
Williams said there’s an added 
level of fear every time a student 
goes to a public place.
“It’s like is this actually safe?” 
Williams said. “Should I be doing 
this? It’s sad and it’s a stress that 
they shouldn’t have to deal with … 
I don’t know how I would balance 
it. I’m so glad I don’t have to make 
that decision.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Madeleine 
Lynch is one of tens of thousands 
of students who will have to make 
those decisions shortly. She stood 
in the north study room Monday 
morning, impressed with the safety 
precautions. 
“I think they’re doing a pretty 
good job keeping everything safe,” 
Lynch said. “I’ve seen all the one-
way signs and I used some Purell 
that was around there. I liked 
the way it was all over the place. 
I noticed there’s only like three 
people at each of these tables, and 
it seems like it’ll be a pretty good 
space. I’d feel safe studying here.”
Lynch is hopeful for a good year 
despite the circumstances. 
“I’m still hoping for a pretty good 
experience, even though you have 
to stay far away from other people,” 
Lynch said. “I’m hoping it’s still 
gonna be a meaningful experience.” 
A floor below, Blue Market 
manager Ann Heiden said many 
students over the years sign up 
for their first job at the basement 
retailer freshman year and keep 
punching in until graduation. 
“It becomes a family,” Heiden 
said. “You work with these people 
— it’s just beautiful.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

Just weeks before fall classes 
start, over 1,400 University of 
Michigan community members 
signed an open letter urging the 
University to provide transpar-
ency in the reopening plans for 
this fall and an analysis outlining 
exactly how these plans will keep 
the community safe. 
The letter — written to the Uni-
versity July 27 — drew professors, 
staff members and graduate and 
undergraduate students to call 
for the logistics and proof of what 
a “public-health informed” fall 
semester will look like. Though 
class instruction modes have been 
adjusted and planned for classes 
still meeting in-person, the letter 
explains, little information has 
been released regarding contain-
ment of the virus.
“We have heard very little about 
other key containment strategies 
such as widespread testing, con-
tact tracing, and isolation of the 
sick,” the letter reads. “The imple-
mentation of these containment 
policies across the whole campus 
would be quite complex and, with 

just one month remaining, we 
have not seen a demonstration that 
plans are in place.”
Physics professor Dante Ami-
dei, one of the contributors to the 
letter, said it is a call for transpar-
ency. 
“We — the folks who are going to 
be bearing this risk — believe that 
as a public institution, the Univer-
sity has a responsibility to put all 
the cards out here on the table, to 
show us the plan and show us an 
analysis of that plan that says that 
this is going to be safe,” Amidei 
said. “We understand that noth-
ing can ever be risk free, but there 
are many examples of analyses like 
this that can take these factors 
into account and estimate the risk 
or not of a plan.”
On 
Aug. 
3, 
the 
University 
released several updates for the 
fall semester, including a require-
ment that all students self-quaran-
tine for 14 days prior to returning 
to campus. The announcement 
also alluded to providing all stu-
dents living in University Housing 
with COVID-19 testing. There are 
no details regarding whether fac-
ulty, staff and students living off-
campus are included.
Though 
the 
University 
has 
released details to testing and iso-
lation methods, Amidei said the 
University is still responsible for 
providing reasoning for how these 
decisions protect its community. 
According to Amidei, the writers 

have since drafted a second letter 
calling for greater transparency on 
the risk analysis.
“We’ve seen the plan, but there 
was nothing in that message about 
point two, which is asking to see 
a critical analysis of the plan that 
shows why it is safe,” Amidei said. 
“We believe this is a public health 
issue that can be addressed by sci-
ence. We want to see the science. 
We would like to see the met-
rics that are being used and the 
expected impact of this plan on the 
health of the surrounding commu-
nities.”
Rackham student Jeff Lock-
hart is a member of the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization’s COVID 
Caucus. Lockhart said detailed 
guidance and procedures sur-
rounding employee infections for 
those currently on campus, includ-
ing researchers and maintenance 
staff, has been provided. 
“There has been, all summer, 
detailed guidance and updates on 
what to do if you have symptoms 
and who to go to in terms of your 
supervisor,” Lockhart said. “If 
someone in your workplace is out 
getting tested, you know what to 
do with their workspace and who 
you can and can’t share the infor-
mation about test results with 
because there’s privacy concerns 
there.”

Students and staff contrast the current changes 
in the building with its pre-pandemic state

Over 1,400 community 
members sign open letter 
calling for transparency


The Daily spoke with Sen. Gary 
Peters, D-Mich., on July 24 about 
his re-election campaign to the 
U.S. Senate, the federal govern-
ment’s COVID-19 response and 
racial inequality. John James is 
the Republican nominee running 
against Peters for the Senate seat 
in this November’s election. The 
James campaign declined multiple 
requests for an interview.
This interview has been edited 
and condensed for clarity.
TMD: Why should young peo-
ple, and college students in par-
ticular, be excited about your 
campaign?
GP: Well, a big focus for my 
campaign is to make sure higher 
education is affordable for all stu-
dents. No matter who they are, 
no matter where they live, they 
should have the opportunity to 
achieve their version of the Ameri-
can Dream and get the education 
they need in order to do that. That 
means we need to make college 
education more affordable. One 
way I’m working to do that is for 
those students who are taking out 
student loans, we need to lower 
the interest rate for student loans. 
At a time with record low interest 
rates, the rates that students pay 
should also be tied to those lower 
rates. That’s why I worked on leg-
islation with Elizabeth Warren to 
lower those rates and we’ll contin-
ue to work to get that passed, but 
getting that passed will require a 
Democratic majority in the Sen-
ate. We’re going to keep working 
on that. Additionally to that, for 
those students, it’s not just about 
taking loans. We should expand 
Pell (Grant) eligibility, so that stu-
dents can get the grants they need 
to pursue their education and not 
be saddled with high loans.
The other issue that is critically 
important to me and one we have 
to be focused on as a society — and 
one that’s going to particularly 
impact students in the years ahead 
— that’s the existential threat of 
climate change. I am passionate 

about protecting our environ-
ment and understand that climate 
change is a critical issue. We have 
to set ambitious goals to reduce 
carbon emissions and do common 
sense things like put the United 
States back into the Paris Accord 
after Donald Trump pulled us out 
of the Paris Accord. The United 
States needs to be a leader in deal-
ing with climate change and we 
need folks who are passionate 
about it in elected office, and that’s 
me.
TMD: Where would you place 
yourself in today’s Democratic 
Party, ideologically?
GP: Well, I think folks would 
consider that I would be a moder-
ate Democrat, somebody who is 
willing to work in a bipartisan way 
in order to get things done, but 
is also a proud Democrat, a very 
proud Democrat. I think part of 
that — the fact that I’m willing to 
work in a bipartisan way— is that 
I do believe that we have to get 
things done. 
Government has to actually 
come together in order to solve the 
very tough problems that we face 
as a society. There is an organiza-
tion called the Center for Effective 
Lawmaking. It is a nonpartisan 
center that was put together by the 
folks at Vanderbilt University and 
the University of Virginia. And 
they actually ranked all senators 
and congresspeople based on their 
effectiveness, which means their 
ability to get legislation passed... 
The last ranking they put out was 
the last Congress, and out of the 
48 Democratic Senators in the U.S. 
Senate, I was ranked the fourth 
most effective. And that’s in my 
first term (as a senator) in Wash-
ington (D.C.),and in the U.S. Sen-
ate, seniority matters. The longer 
you’re there, the more ability you 
have to get things done. And yet 
just in just my first term, I was 
ranked the fourth most effective.
TMD: As a member of the fed-
eral government, how would you 
evaluate the federal government’s

The University of Michigan 
recently announced students must 
adhere to a mandatory two-week 
quarantine before they arrive on 
campus in the fall. This policy 
received criticism from students 
who are currently working and 
those who are living in on-campus 
housing. 
Business junior Kayla Hurd said 
in a tweet that the University’s 
reopening plans do not consider 
low-income students who have in-
person jobs.
Business sophomore Madelyn 
Larson worked as a pool atten-
dant all summer and said the 
announcement of the two-week 
quarantine came very late, not 
giving her enough time to give her 
boss a two-week advance notice.
“It was very much just a blanket 
statement,” Larson said. “I under-
stand that (the administration) 
have obviously a lot going on … but 
I think that advance notice could 
have been given since they have 
known since March that there is a 
pandemic.”
LSA sophomore Riann English 
also voiced concerns about the 

mandatory 
quarantine, 
saying 
there was no way the University 
could determine whether some-
one has followed the proper proto-
col of enhanced social distancing. 
“I think, in theory, it’s a good 
idea, but in practice and in reality, 
(you) cannot control what people 
do,” English said. “You don’t know 
where other people have been or 
what they’re carrying.”
University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen directed The Daily 
in an email to the enhanced 
social distancing section of the 
announcement sent Monday. She 
also wrote that students who are 
in Ann Arbor are allowed to break 
their quarantine to work. 
“Students are not prohibited 
from working once they are in 
Ann Arbor,” Broekhuizen wrote. 
“This 14-day period of enhanced 
social distancing is designed to 
minimize the spread of COVID-
19 as our students return to Ann 
Arbor from all over the country.”
Working on campus will also 
likely look different this fall as 
many campus employees — includ-
ing students — will continue to 
work remotely if they are able. 
Larson further explained how 
the guideline puts low-income 
students at a disadvantage of con-
tracting COVID-19 and losing pay.
“On top of the 1.9 percent 
tuition increase, the jobs that are 
available are much more likely 
to be in-person, necessary jobs 

which are obviously more risky 
and could lead to coming into 
contact with somebody who is 
positive (for COVID-19) and then 
you’re gonna have to take another 
two weeks (off),” Larson said.
Some students also expressed 
concerns 
about 
the 
upcom-
ing semester and the risk of the 
COVID-19 virus spreading on 
campus, including in dorms and 
community spaces such as frat 
houses. LSA sophomore Rakira 
Urquhart said she was worried 
about the confined dorm spaces 
on campus.
“I know that the room sizes are 
like 12 by 12, so it just didn’t make 
sense to me that, you know, they 
were going to have people living to 
people in such a small space with 
everything going on,” Urquhart 
said. “Who knows what my room-
mate, or what I would do … outside 
of the room?”
English also noted she doesn’t 
understand why there are not 
more 
restrictions 
on 
housing 
given the current COVID-19 pan-
demic. 
“I feel like everyone should be 
in a single,” English said. “I know 
the other universities have tried 
to do that, to a certain extent — in 
my knowledge — but (Michigan) 
hasn’t done that in any capacity at 
all.”

A

mid the global COVID-19 pan-
demic, the American people are 
struggling to find a healthy rou-
tine. Across the country, people are reck-
lessly jumping the gun, looking to return 
to pre-pandemic life while their fellow 
American brothers and sisters die. Bars 
and restaurants are packed, parties rage 
and crowds gather with reckless aban-
don, often without masks. Our immedi-
ate future seems bleak and irredeemable. 
These pivotal times, while uncertain, 
present an opportunity to explore the 
potential good of humanity. In the Unit-
ed States, from large corporations to 
small businesses, people are working to 
mitigate the devastating impact of this 
virus. Any innovation, from the simplic-
ity of curbside pickup to the advanced 
science of vaccine development, pushes 
us toward the light at the end of the 
tunnel. Many manufacturers — includ-
ing the auto industry — have switched 
gears to provide our hospitals with ven-
tilators and face shields. Non-essential 
workspaces have closed their doors and 
switched to contactless business mod-
els. Grocery delivery has minimized 
the number of people in public spaces. 
Video interface technology has made at-
home work possible for countless peo-
ple, saving countless lives. Nevertheless, 
we have not done enough. The novel 
coronavirus continues to wreak havoc 
on our country. Thousands are dying. 
Yet, we press on. The University of 
Michigan’s leaders have concocted a 
plan for hybrid and in-person classes, 
for moving into apartments and dorm 
rooms and for finding public spaces to 
study. They have sent emails detailing 
plans for a “safe” return, stressing the 
importance of masks, social distancing 
and have encouraged a self-imposed 
quarantine before returning to campus. 
Our schedules have been altered, spring 
break is no longer and all final exams will 
be held online. This is certainly a great 
start, but it is clearly not enough. 
Aside from the unassailable reality 
that many of the proposed rules 
(especially the self-imposed quarantine) 
are impossible to enforce, the crux 
of the matter is this plan’s failure to 
address the bigger picture. In order to 
not only contain this virus, but to keep 
our economy afloat, feed our people and 
provide proper social services, many 
still need to put themselves in harm’s 
way. These essential frontline workers 
bear the brunt of this pandemic to 
ensure the safety of others. If we truly 
cared about their well-being, we would 
do everything in our power to physically 
distance, stay home and avoid all public 
buildings and crowded spaces. Those 
with the ability to distance themselves 
have a responsibility to do so in order 
to reduce the risk to those without the 

same luxury. This same logic applies to 
returning to school in the fall. Whether 
it is public, private, elementary or 
college, those of us who do not have 
to go back should be leaving space for 
those who have no other choice but to 
return to school.
The basic rules and requirements in 
place will not necessarily stop the spread 
of the virus. The University’s leaders have 
set aside quarantined housing for sick 
students, implying they foresee a number 
of students falling ill due to their return 
to campus. What happens if just one 
student dies? Does school continue? Do 
they send everyone back home, exposing 
their families and communities? Would 
it have been worth it to put students 
back in the classroom? If the return 
to in-person classes results in one 
mistake, one accidental transmission, 
the sickness and possible death that 
follows will be the consequence of our 
lack of innovation. 
There is an opportunity for the 
University to show the country what the 
Leaders and the Best can do when faced 
with an unthinkable challenge. Just as 
car companies have switched gears to 
manufacture medical equipment, the 
University could switch gears to provide 
an education to their students that is 
worth the tuition — sans the risk of 
exposure to the virus. Adapting classes 
for virtual instruction, educating our 
students about the impacts and science 
of this pandemic, implementing new 
software and project creation tools and 
providing sanitary spaces for faculty to 
virtually lead labs and demonstrations 
from campus is just the tip of the 
iceberg. Beyond the coursework, the 
University could utilize the planned 
tuition increase to fund laptops and 
internet access for students who do 
not have proper resources at home, 
establish curbside pickup routines for 
University services such as dining halls, 
use dorms to exclusively house students 
that live in difficult home situations 
and provide ample advising resources 
for students to improve their access to 
the University’s myriad of resources. 
This can be accomplished while almost 
entirely limiting in-person interaction. 
While no solution is perfect, we have 
the responsibility and the power to inno-
vate, adapt and overcome this pandemic. 
Challenges of such magnitude will con-
tinue to cost lives, and the more we push 
the envelope to allow for a “normal” 
college experience, the farther we fall 
behind in our ability to lead others to a 
brighter, and healthier, future. 

W

hat felt like a distant real-
ity for the past six months 
is finally here. In just a few 
short weeks, students across the nation 
will be reckoning with school start-ups 
— whether that means cautiously moving 
into a new apartment on campus or log-
ging onto Canvas from your hometown. 
As we gear up for the long-anticipated fall 
semester, inboxes are filled with campus-
wide public health-advised guidelines for 
courses, clubs and sports, and I can’t help 
but feel a little nostalgic for a time before 
COVID-19 and masks. The optimist in me 
had hoped that summer would be the end 
of it, but now a corona-less future seems 
unimaginable — or at least until 2024. 
Working at a local grocery store this sum-
mer, I feel my current cynicism deepen 
with every customer that refuses to wear 
a mask during their 10-minute grocery 
runs despite Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s 
statewide orders — that, and seeing vid-
eos and Snapchat stories of “COVID-19 
petri dish” parties and gatherings. 
I’d like to think my peers and I will 
be more responsible and considerate 
on campus, but higher risk of infection 
on college grounds across the country 
has already been deemed inevitable 
by a New York Times survey prior to 
the new academic year. Unfortunately, 
this is not all that surprising given the 
night-life crowds that took over Ann 
Arbor bars after Whitmer’s rescinding 
of the Safer at Home Order in June and 
Theta Chi’s careless summer kickback. 
Our image as the Leaders and the Best 
was rightfully scrutinized then, and it is 
bound to face even heavier surveillance 
during this experimental semester. 
As university students, it’s high time 
our increasingly expensive schooling 
be put to productive use this semes-

ter. According to a New York Times 
article, we are impulsive, risk-taking 
college students that study together, 
live together, party together and sleep 
together. And they’re right. As thou-
sands of students are welcomed back, 
campuses will become what psycholo-
gists call a strong situation in which 
external environmental forces define 
the desirability of potential behaviors 
despite an individual’s personal tenden-
cies and personality. This is especially 
true in cultural systems like that of uni-
versities where the norm is the often 
anti-intellectual nature of college stu-
dent culture. The enduring coronavirus 
calls for a reevaluation of hookup cul-
ture and reckless school spirit, and we 
must be the ones at the forefront of this 
battle against amateur human tendency. 
While reopening campuses seems 
like a doomed endeavor from the begin-
ning, we should take this opportunity to 
redefine our college experience apart 
from tailgating and Thursday night 
excursions — whether that means 
spending more time on Zoom meetings 
and nights in, or looking deeper into the 
flaws of our own college culture. Amid 
a global pandemic that doesn’t seem 
to be going anywhere any time soon, 
it’s time for a cultural reset, if you will 
— one that encompasses a little more 
accountability for our actions. The only 
question is: Are we up for the challenge? 
For everyone’s sake, I sure hope so. 
This quarantine period has woken 
America up to the glaring systemic 
issues of highly politicized public health 
initiatives, structural racism within 
every established institution and the col-
lateral damage from U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement policies. It 
would be for naught if we did not bring 

those issues back to our own schooling 
as many have done with the newly resur-
faced review and reassessment petition 
for the University of Michigan’s Race 
and Ethnicity requirement as well as the 
student-led petition in response to ICE’s 
recent international student regulation. 
A return to normalcy is not necessar-
ily in order. Rather, heavier precautions 
and inquiry imposed by administration 
and the student body is vital to ensure 
that we do not succumb to the normal 
we once knew. We must keep demand-
ing more from our institution and 
from our peers as privileged pioneers 
of higher education. This fall will be 
extremely uncertain, but one thing is 
for sure: Public health must be a priority 
in the eyes of every individual on cam-
pus. In the best of scenarios, our collec-
tive efforts to reduce risk of infection in 
an environment that thrives on social 
interaction will still result in unforgiving 
blame for any campus-related cases. So 
don’t give our academic administration 
another reason to look down upon the 
fickle and instinctive college population. 
As future leaders, having experi-
enced this hardship will make us more 
perceptive to better problem solving 
and policy making. We will have expe-
rienced the frustration and courage to 
let disproportionately unheard voices 
be heard as we pursue a new normal. 
This semester will be trying for us all, 
but I remain — perhaps naively — opti-
mistic in the fact that we will come out 
of this as better change makers, six feet 
apart. There’s nothing I hate more than 
being disappointed, so wear a mask, 
wash your hands and don’t be a jerk.

Back to school, not to normal

I

n the past month, I have 
observed friends and peers 
drop their fraternity and soror-
ity life memberships due to the his-
toric and current racism embedded 
in the institution. Every year, there 
are more videos of historically white 
fraternities and sororities (HWFS) 
chanting racist slurs or being 
exposed for racist practices in their 
rush strategies. As a new member, 
there have been many mandatory 
educational trainings on not being 
a bystander when it comes to sexual 
assault or alcohol abuse, but I was 
never educated on racism in Greek life. 
It was never prioritized in our discus-
sions on what needed to change. 
Greek life members must under-
stand the institution they are 
associating themselves with and 
supporting. When HWFS were first 
establishing themselves on college 
campuses across the country, there 
were few people of color permitted 
into higher education institutions. 
However, even as the population 
of students of color grew, rules and 
regulations were put in place to keep 
on-campus organizations, including 
Greek life, white. For example, codes of 
exclusion were added to many frater-
nity and sorority charters, mandating 
that members be white and Christian. 
Even before the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act, in the 1950s, many states 
enacted anti-discrimination laws 
that pushed fraternities and sorori-
ties to desegregate. While official 
practices of exclusion based on race 
were removed by the 70s, national 
chapters never pushed for diversity. 
Through favoring legacies in recruit-
ment, requiring hair to be done a 
certain way for events, rushing for 
girls that “fit into our group” and 
not prioritizing diversity, HWFS 
have remained — for the most part — 
white and from a higher social class. 
At the University of Alabama, 
there was only one Black woman 
offered a bid into a historically white 
sorority from its founding in 1904 
up until 2013. Moreover, in 2015, a 
video surfaced of Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon at the University of Oklahoma 
singing a racist chant that uses 
racial slurs and supports lynching. 
Just recently, fraternity members at 
the University of Arkansas mocked 
the death of George Floyd.
Many organizations on campus 
are made up of people that have 
similar backgrounds, cultures and 
values. It is human nature for people 
to want to congregate with people 
they relate to. So what is wrong with 
Greek life being this way? The differ-

ence between Greek life and other 
organizations on college campuses 
is that Greek life events often make 
up the majority of members’ social 
and philanthropic activities. When 
members live with their chapter, 
party with their chapter and do com-
munity service through their chap-
ter, they aren’t simply surrounding 
themselves with people from the 
same background: They are only 
surrounding themselves with people 
from the same background. This envi-
ronment allows members to live in the 
glorious ignorance of white privilege 
and face little to no consequences for 
their racist and oppressive actions. 
When I joined Greek life, I made 
a promise to myself that I would not 
allow it to take over my entire life. 
I am involved in other clubs, have 
separate groups of friends and have 
made my chapter only a fragment of 
my university life. So, I had to ask 
myself, what harm am I causing by 
supporting my national chapter, both 
physically and financially? 
A social media post has circulated 
from a Duke University anti-Greek 
life Instagram account that discuss-
es the “FratPAC” — a political-action 
committee dedicated to increasing 
Greek life presence in Congress and 
to “enhance the fraternal experi-
ence.” The post claims that Greek life 
membership dues are going to this 
PAC. The FratPAC donates to both 
Democrats and Republicans and 
claims to be unbiased. However, the 
list of senators receiving donations 
in the 2020 cycle is predominantly 
white. Pushing for more Greek mem-
bers in government is pushing for 
more white people in government. 
Another issue with the FratPAC 
is the legislation it lobbies for. One 
example is the Safe Campus Act, 
which would prevent universities 
from being able to independently 
investigate sexual assault allega-
tions or punish the accused until the 
case is closed by the police. Not only 
does this violate Title IX, but crimi-
nal cases can take years and this 
would allow the accused to remain 
in their chapter with the opportu-
nity to continue to perpetuate harm 
within the campus community. 
Other legislation they have lobbied 
for includes a requirement of more 
proof for sexual assault cases, tax 
breaks for Greek houses and less 
punishment for hazing measures. 
What the social media post from 
Duke does not acknowledge, how-
ever, is that it is individual donors 
and chapters who donate to the PAC, 
not national Greek organizations. 

While your chapter may be donat-
ing to the FratPAC, being a member 
of Greek life does not automatically 
mean your money is supporting 
this committee. Linked is the list 
of donors for the 2020 cycle. Mem-
bers of Greek life have the power to 
demand that their chapter does not 
donate. 
I have not dropped Greek life 
because I believe members have 
the power to cause a change in the 
organization. While I cannot speak 
for other chapters, I am proud of 
the internal changes and efforts my 
chapter has made in recent months. 
These changes include forming a 
guide with petitions and educa-
tional resources, a new Diversity 
and Inclusion chair position, a list 
of classes that members feel have 
helped them gain new perspec-
tives, a fundraiser for The Bail 
Project and Detroit Justice Center 
and the formation of a book club to 
support artists from different cul-
tures/backgrounds. 
This is not to say that my soror-
ity is different from the “bad ones” 
or is not a part of the problem. This 
is to say that members of Greek life 
who choose to remain members 
should support change, inclusion 
efforts and diversity in their chap-
ters and condemn their chapters 
when change is being rejected. 
For Greek life to truly change, 
however, there must be efforts at 
both the local and the national 
organization level. The national 
headquarters of HWFS need to 
make inclusion and diversity a pri-
ority in their efforts moving for-
ward. Educational programming 
should include training on white 
privilege, supremacy and racism. 
Social media accounts should not 
just be a plethora of white faces in 
expensive clothing on vacations.
If Greek life wants to remain on 
college campuses, they need to not 
only accept change but be a part 
of the effort. Racism is a rampant 
issue in America, and while Greek 
life is not the root cause of it, it does 
currently perpetuate segregation, 
white privilege, ignorance and 
racism on college campuses. Mem-
bers of Greek life across the nation 
need to change the structure and 
culture of the entire institution by 
holding their chapter, organiza-
tion and peers accountable for con-
scious progress towards inclusion 
and against racism. 

O

n July 31, details from the 
independent investigation of 
former University of Michigan 
Provost Martin Philbert confirmed 
years of unchecked sexual harassment, 
a pervasive fear of retaliation and 
inaction by the University. In an open 
letter following the report, University 
President Mark Schlissel said the 
University administration “should make 
any changes necessary to prevent this 
from happening ever again.” And yet, 
on Aug. 14, new Title IX regulations 
from U.S. Secretary of Education 
Betsy DeVos will erode institutional 
responsibility 
and 
strip 
away 
protections for those brave enough to 
report sexual violence on campus. 
As a member of Student Sexual 
Assault and Harassment Legal Advocacy 
Service, an independent project by 
law students to advocate for survivors 
reporting sexual misconduct through 
the University’s Title IX process, it is 
clear to me what needs to change — and 
it is clear to me that I need to speak up 
now to advocate for that change.
Our institution stands at the crossroads 
of an opportunity to reimagine and 
recreate its Title IX processes and an 
impending mandate to strip away many 
of the measures that protect survivors. 
The University has not announced its 
plans for changing policies to comply 
with the new federal requirements, and 
it will have little choice but to follow 
these new rules, no matter how 
misguided they may be. 
But federal regulations establish a 
floor, not a ceiling for reform, and there 
are more insidious problems with the 
Title IX policies: problems for which 
the University itself is responsible. 
These problems are not often visible 
to those who haven’t gone through the 
reporting process themselves. But they 
are problems the University has full 
power to change. In light of Philbert’s 
harmful behavior and the institutional 
indifference that enabled it to continue 
for over a decade, the University should 
use this moment to change.
Oversight of OIE: In his message 
regarding the Philbert investigation, 
Schlissel 
includes 
among 
the 
recommendations proposed that when 
sexual misconduct involving the Office 
of the Provost is reported, the Office of 
the Provost should not oversee the Office 
of Institutional Equity (which conducts 
Title IX investigations) as usual.
This is an excellent start. I challenge 
the University to go further. There 
should be independent oversight of 
OIE in all instances — not just those 
in which its supervising office is 
implicated. The Office of the Provost 
is charged with oversight of a wide 

swath of departments at the University, 
including Academic Human Resources, 
Office of Financial Aid, Office of 
Undergraduate Admissions and the 
deans of every college and school on the 
Ann Arbor campus. Conflicts of interest 
thus do not only occur when a sexual 
misconduct report is made involving 
an Office of the Provost employee or 
faculty member; they are present when 
a report is made involving any of the 
other units reporting to the provost. 
It is not enough to merely have 
different administrators responsible 
for different divisions. Intimidation 
and fear of institutional retaliation are 
possible in many different ways from 
many different places. It matters little 
whether the University considers such 
intimidation or retaliation likely — what 
matters is that such fears are keenly felt 
by survivors. I should know. I felt 
those fears myself when I reported a 
sexual assault as an undergraduate at 
another university.
It’s vital that survivors feel secure 
in reporting assault or harassment 
when it occurs. If they don’t feel sure 
that those overseeing their reports will 
react and behave independently and 
appropriately, or if it seems that there 
are far too many people who could 
influence or become involved in their 
reports, horrendous acts by students 
and faculty alike will continue to 
be kept secret by those who suffer 
them. Part of supporting survivors is 
trusting their accounts of flaws and 
risks in this process.
What comes to mind in terms of 
oversight 
is 
the structure 
many 
universities have in place for their 
ombuds offices: In order to assure 
true independence, the ombudsperson 
must report directly to the highest 
position 
in 
their 
independent 
institution. If the University wants 
sexual misconduct investigations to be 
truly, securely independent, it should 
consider the same for OIE.
Broad Discretion of Hearing Officers: 
The University’s sexual misconduct 
policy provides that, when an incident 
of assault or harassment is investigated 
and goes to a hearing, the lone hearing 
officer “has absolute discretion to 
decide upon a format for the hearing.” 
Giving one individual responsibility 
over the hearing and its outcome, and 
then giving that individual “absolute 
discretion” over how the hearing is to 
be conducted, is a recipe for disaster.

OPINION


In the prologue of his 2019 memoir, cho-
reographer Mark Morris wrote that “the 
live aspect of performance is what appeals: 
the dancers, the musicians, the audience — 
all living beings in the same room. People 
might say they’ve watched a dance on You-
Tube and they have. But they haven’t. It 
isn’t live.” Morris is so passionate about this 
point that he reiterates it in almost every 
subsequent chapter. By the time the book is 
finished, his emphasis of live dance set to 
live music feels practically annoying. 
And yet, on May 29, the New York Times 
published an article on Morris’s new adven-
tures with Zoom — the choreographer used 
the video communication platform to cre-
ate four new works, all now available on 
YouTube. While Zoomed choreography 
may feel like a monotonous phrase as we 
approach the second half of August, Mor-
ris was one of the earlier pioneers in this 
world of digital dance creation. In the May 
article, dance critic Gia Kourlas framed the 
process as inventive; she was excited by the 
now-customary technique, curious about 
his inspiration to still create amid stay-at-
home orders. Morris told Kourlas that he 
felt annoyed by the idea that our lives must 
be on hold throughout this pandemic. “This 
is how we’re living,” he said, “and there’s no 
real reason to fight it” — an admirably quick 
adjustment for someone who, just last year, 
published a book so adamantly in favor of 
live performance.
At the beginning of May, I sat on my 
living room floor and wrote the introduc-
tion to this series, telling the brief story 
of theatres that still remain dark today. I 
asked readers: What happens when we’re 
left with a stage wholly mediated by posts, 
shares, comments and likes? At the time, 
I’m not sure if I thought the ghost lights 
would be off by now, at the end of The Dai-
ly’s summer editions. In May, many ballet 
companies still planned to return to their 
stages come fall; many summer festivals 

still had not announced cancellation. And 
yet, as the days grow shorter, most Ameri-
can stages remain completely empty. Thus, 
as this series comes to a close, it seems my 
question should remain at our forefront — 
what happens when we’re left with a stage 
wholly mediated by posts, shares, com-
ments and likes, and what happens when 
that digital stage continues indefinitely 
into the future? 
I have several potential answers, many 
of which I hope remain embedded in my 
various installments of this series. I wrote 
about Christopher Wheeldon’s “Within 
the Golden Hour” and examined how the 
blooming natural world can provide in-per-
son beauty when ballet goes online. I wrote 
about Tiler Peck’s online dance classes and 
the larger movement of celebrity acces-
sibility afforded by COVID-19. I examined 
and analyzed the many ways in which this 
pandemic exposed structural failures of 
artistic funding: Companies now face fiscal 
meltdowns in part created and aggravated 
by a government that does not acknowl-
edge the economic importance of an arts 
sector. Millions of dancers and backstage 
workers will likely be out of work for over 
a year. With the rise of national protests for 
Black lives, I wrote about the deep-rooted 
racial prejudice of ballet’s past and pres-
ent along with this art form’s substantial 
role in the ripples of white supremacy that 
permeate our shores. I wrote about ballet’s 
structural failures to support Black artists 
and suggested that quarantine be used as 
an active moment to listen, learn and lean 
into the acknowledgement of such wrong-
doings. I also wrote about my deep love for 
this art form. More than once this summer, 
the sounds of ballet’s music and the pat-
terns of its movement have eased my head 
and heart of depressing anxiety generated 
by our country’s sociopolitical reckoning 
that is no doubt far from over.

It takes only a page or two of reading 
to realize that the cover of “Milkman” is 
deceptive. The binding of the 2018 win-
ner of the Man Booker Prize depicts an 
innocuous, fluorescent-pink sunset — 
one of those once a year, stop-and-snap-
a-photo sunsets that makes “Milkman” 
stands out among its fellow books.
The sedative lightness of the cover 
seems to admit innocuousness. But 
“Milkman” is not innocuous. Nor is it 
gentle, or quiet, or apologetic — nothing 
that the cover may suggest about a sub-
dued, romantic narrative. To say I wasn’t 
excited to read the Booker winner would 
be a lie — based on the superficiality of 
covers and excerpts, I have rooted for 
“Milkman” since its nomination on the 
long-list — but the way I fell in love with 
reading “Milkman” was not in the pleas-
ant, blushing manner I had expected. It 
was a cycle of shock, recoil and return.
Anna Burns’s third novel narrates the 
story of an 18-year-old girl (referred to 
as “Middle Sister,” as none of the charac-
ters in “Milkman” are prescribed actual 
names) over the course of two months. 
Her unnamed town is saturated with vio-
lence — violence from the ubiquitously 
demonized enemy countries “over the 
water,” violence from the renouncers 
of the state that control Middle Sister’s 
town and violence from the state police 
as they intervene in a village of scattered 
revolutionaries. 
Surprisingly, 
though, 
this war-zone setting is but an offhand 
normality in the book. Instead, it is Milk-
man, a paramilitary that begins making 
unwarranted advances on middle sister, 
that takes the place of chief antagonist 
in the book.
At first glance, Burns lays out an invid-
ious landscape that seems to hyperbolize 
the dark experience of growing up as a 
woman in the late 20th century. Maybe, 
Burns seems to suggest, the descent of 
society would look like this for all gen-
ders. But on second thought, the land-
scape Middle Sister walks — and how 
her 
hyperaware, 
rightfully-paranoid 
thoughts congeal in it — becomes pain-
fully real. Middle Sister’s encounters 
with Milkman while walking, her fears 
of being drugged, the pernicious com-
ments coming from third brother-in-law, 
all resonate uncomfortably with the real-
ties meeting women today.
This daring, critical kick at that expe-
rience of being a woman pays off. The 
apotheosis of the book’s dark and appli-
cable portrayals is perhaps Tablets Girl, 

a “girl who was actually a woman,” that 
is one of the local outcasts in Middle 
Sister’s town due to her propensity to 
poison people. This usually takes place, 
most suitably and without retribution, 
in bars. People flee from Tablets Girl, 
people watch their drinks when Tablets 
Girl is around. It’s not just Burns’s clear 
allusion to date-rape that that is to be 
appreciated here, but her spiked humor 
and exaggeration also.
This is not to reduce “Milkman” down 
to a forced, constricted focus on gender-
politics though. Burns’s writing alone is 
remarkable (something I refuse to say 
passively). “Milkman” is brimming with 
endlessly long paragraphs, lose-your-
train-of-thought stretched sentences and 
digressing thoughts from Middle Sister 
that render the book incredibly complex. 
At first, I was perturbed by this formal 
and royal-esque writing, especially upon 
an encounter with a paragraph spanning 
four, almost five, pages. But as I contin-
ued, I found myself — in an unlikely way 
— reading Middle Sister’s voice in an 
uninterrupted pattern even more critical 
and translucent than I expected possible. 
This is assisted by Burns’s near-perfect 
draw of synonyms through the book, 
making her writing appear dependably 
careful and personal.
I was enamored by the characters in 
“Milkman” and the abrasive humor that 
was tacked onto them. It isn’t often that 
I get a full cast of characters (narrator, 
antagonist, family) that are so real, so 
exciting to encounter. Most memorable 
are the “wee sisters,” Middle Sister’s 
three younger sisters who, despite their 
young ages, are infatuated with topics 
such as French revolutionaries, going 
through “Kafka phases” and eavesdrop-
ping every moment they get. Characters 
like the wee sisters offer unexpected 
gratification along Burns’s dark time-
line of events. The real humor displayed 
make “Milkman” all the more authentic 
and pleasurable.
I love “Milkman” because it is a fruit-
ful attempt to offer me hints of a human 
experience I will never be able to under-
stand, let alone be familiar with. Perhaps 
the most evocative and vivid account in 
the vein of social-rebellion and unwant-
ed-gaze I have ever encountered, “Milk-
man” is a narrative that has been told 
repeatedly, even frequently in the 21st 
century. Burns’s unequivocal writing 
turns this narrative into a fearsome 
chant, one well worth shouting along to.

Imperial 
Triumphant’s 
newest 
album, 
Alphaville might be the most versatile album 
of the year. To call the black metal trio strange 
would be an understatement; their latest work is 
a raging, depraved inferno that combines brutal 
death metal, jazz and even doo-wop to disorient-
ing effect. 
Despite Alphaville’s colossal battery and 
sheer weirdness, the album has its mellifluous 
moments. The constant variation in genre, tone 
and energy expertly paints a picture of Imperial 
Triumphant’s worldview — metropolitan and 
decaying, yet tangible and stimulating. 
One needs to look no further than the album’s 
vexing opener, “Rotted Futures,” to get a taste 
for the band’s verve. The song swaps feverishly 
between organic whirring, whimsical blast beats 
and a haunting, odd meter guitar riff. “Value 
established / Society elated / Alas, the eclipsing 
hour / Where our fear turns to profit” singer 
Zachary Ezrin bellows, describing consumption 
and decay as two sides of the same coin.
Mind-boggling rhythms become a crucial 
trait of Alphaville, especially in the opening mel-
ody of “City Swine” and the overpowering dirge 
of “Atomic Age.” Musical patterns are anything 
but uniform; they more closely resemble the 
erratic thuds of a Godzilla on his nightly ram-
page than even beats. The album’s perspective 
on modern existence is bruised and warped, so 
its time signatures are too.
Beyond provoking some crazed headbang-
ing and horrified facial expressions, Alphaville 
incorporates beautifully intricate melody amid 
the madness. The opulently jazzy intro of 
“Transmission to Mercury” is a breath of unpol-
luted air before the song diverges into primal 
growls and breakneck speed. Yet, the most satis-
fying aspect of the track — and largely the album 

itself — is its willingness to bring together the 
angel and the demon sitting on its two shoulders. 

The dancing brass notes eventually do return 
to “Transmission,” overlaying death metal 
drums and a dissonant choir. The record is at 
its best when it adamantly refuses to sacrifice 
one style for another. Creating an entire run-
time dedicated to these clashes in genre would 
have likely been too inaccessible for any audi-
ence. So instead, Imperial Triumphant opts for 
something more multicameral, patiently build-
ing up contrary ideas until there is no choice 
left but to fuse them. The results are short last-
ing but explosive, perhaps most successfully on 
the bridge of “Atomic Age.” This passage, a few 
ascending melodies smashed violently onto a 
wall of sonic chaos, always incites a relisten from 
me.
Predictably, another one of these exultant 
peaks arrives at the title track’s chorus, which 
can only be described as a cross between “The 
Twilight Zone” and symphonic metal. The jux-
taposition of a feeble, Vaudevillian tune over 
brazen, guttural chanting haunts me. It’s simply 
glorious, like the sun flares of a dying star shining 
through storm clouds from another dimension. 
Between Code Orange’s Underneath and 
Loathe’s I Let It in and It Took Everything, 2020 
has been a fascinating year for metal fusion. 
Alphaville fits nicely into this dynamic, despite 
being the quirkiest of the bunch. While the 
inherent barrier to enjoying such an experi-
mental release may shorten its staying power, 
Alphaville is undeniably one of the freshest 
and most challenging metal albums of the year. 
Even though listening to the entire album in 
one sitting can be an overwhelming demand, 
Alphaville is more than worthwhile.

The White House briefing room seethes 
with reporters. Many are confused, enraged 
and even terrified. All, though, are dead 
focused on the press secretary.
“I think we are very much still in a discov-
ery period regarding who They are and what 
They want,” she says. 
A reporter interrupts her. “These are very 
dangerous words, you understand? They? 
Them? To anyone in this country who looks 
differently, or speaks differently, or behaves 
differently? Do you see how using language 
like this, right now, could lead to more civil-
ian deaths?”
The press secretary doesn’t respond to the 
question, because Fox News butts in — “Isn’t 
it possible this is an act of radical Islamic ter-
rorism?”
So begins the apocalypse in George 
Romero and Daniel Kraus’s “The Living 
Dead.” Not with a bang, not with a whimper, 
but with the American government bun-
gling its response to a devastating pandemic, 
and fanning the flames of division at a time 
when everyone needs to pull together. Sound 
familiar? 
George Romero, who created, or at least 
finalized, the modern concept of the zom-
bie, had been working on this novel for 
decades before his death in 2017. Daniel 
Kraus, co-author of “The Shape of Water” 
novel, swooped in to finish it. The book, at 
635 pages, is thick enough to be wielded as 
a weapon if the dead do indeed walk (and 
in the last half of 2020, who knows at this 
point?). 
“The Living Dead” has a breadth Romero, 
whose films were usually low budget and 
independent, never achieved. Without need-
ing to rely on special effects, which even in 
Romero’s masterpieces weren’t always the 
most convincing, Romero and Kraus’s zom-
bies shamble through, and destroy, a wide 
range of locales all over North America. An 
aircraft carrier off the coast of California 
and Toronto’s Fort York are two highlights. 
The characters also vary in color, gender 
and sexuality, continuing and expanding on 
Romero’s interest in America’s diversity and 
how the American mainstream responds to 
it, which has been clear since his first zom-
bie film, ’68’s “Night of The Living Dead.” 
Kraus and Romero maintain a light, 
page-turning prose, with a descriptive flair, 
reminiscent of Stephen King at his best. The 
novel also has a razor sharp sense of time, 
averting the potholes that long, apocalyptic 
fiction usually stumbles into. Stephen King’s 
“The Stand,” while a masterwork, tears for-
ward as a virus destroys America, but stalls 

after the outbreak ends, and never quite cap-
tures its initial tension. Even the ever-popu-
lar “The Walking Dead” series, both on page 
and screen, loses its momentum as the nar-
rative leaves behind the horrifying intensity 
of total, apocalyptic chaos. 
“The Living Dead,” unlike its shambling 
creatures, rockets forward until the very 
last page. It knows when to draw out tense 
moments of uncertainty, when to explode 
in bloody horror, and when to condense and 
summarize. This helps since the narrative is 
split between a number of viewpoint char-
acters, and takes place over 15 years. When 
the virus ceases to be a threat, like in “The 
Stand” and “The Walking Dead,” things are 
no less intense since the factors that let the 
disease run rampant, America’s myriad divi-
sions, have only worsened. This book is ter-
rifying cover to cover as its plot, while full 
of the gore, bullets and ironic, sanguinary 
Romero wit fans will expect, has a crushing, 
almost prophetic relevance.
In “Night of the Living Dead,” a Black 
character survives hordes of zombies, only 
to be killed by white militiamen in the 
film’s final frame. In “Dawn of The Dead,” 
zombies are drawn to a shopping mall, and 
wander dead-eyed through its saccharine 
halls. In “Land of the Dead,” the rich live on 
the upper floors of a skyscraper, while the 
lower classes make dangerous supply runs 
to maintain their lavish lifestyles.
“The Living Dead” packs these satirical 
threads into one epic narrative, threading 
together Romero’s interests in America’s 
prejudice, consumerism, wealth gap and 
institutional failure. By doing so, it unin-
tentionally analyzes what is helping the 
COVID-19 pandemic utterly destroy Amer-
ica.
The zombie attacks begin in nursing 
homes and low income areas. Middle and 
upper class Americans ignore them as long 
as possible, and the government does not 
offer a coordinated response, instead play-
ing down the danger until the last possible 
moment. This is nothing far-fetched. As 
one character puts it, “It’s Regan laughing 
off AIDS. It’s Bush saying, ‘Mission accom-
plished.’ ” It is also Trump and his cronies 
ignoring COVID-19. 
“If our inattention is part of why this 
started where it started, and why no one can 
stop it . . . Maybe it had to happen,” another 
character laments. “It feels like we’ve been 
sleepwalking through a dreamworld we 
convinced ourselves was working just fine 
for everyone. It may be too late, but at least 
we’re waking up.”

MICHIGAN IN COLOR

A letter from the editors

As the summer comes to a close, 
and our time as Managing Editors 
is now complete, we would like to 
close off with a letter and a hope 
for MiC — an ode to a summer of 
revolution, if you will. Neither 
of us could have predicted what 
we signed up for, but we are more 
than proud of what we were able 
to accomplish. Thanks to a group 
of brilliant and talented writers 
and staff, we were able to pull off 
a summer of enlightening and edu-
cational series of writing which 
not only shared personal experi-
ences or reflections, but provided 
scholastic and experiential insight 
into the many departments and 
institutions that feed the Black 
and Indigenous plight in America 
— a truth that is often rejected and 
whose existence is perpetuated 
through journalism. Not only did 
we learn so much from our peers, 
but we are so grateful to have been 
given this opportunity to amplify 
issues in our country which have 
been occurring since the genesis 
of our nation, and which built the 
nation. These issues will persist 
until we confront them in every 
system through which we function 
— social, governmental, economic, 
etc. — we hold our peers account-
able for this same confrontation, 
actively educate ourselves on how 
these systems affect society at 
micro and macro levels and utilize 
that education to grow and change 
with an united front. 
Michigan in Color started out 
as a safe community exclusively 
for BIPOC to write and share their 

experiences at the University of 
Michigan and in the broad United 
States. We tried our best this sum-
mer to uphold MiC traditions while 
also adjusting to inevitable change 
and pursuing necessary actions as 
a section to carry on the change we 
instigated this summer. Before we 
give up our positions, we would like 
to remind others, especially at The 
Michigan Daily, that the sentiment 
of change which began this sum-
mer can not and should not stop 
here. The newspaper’s responsibili-
ty does not only rest in its published 
content, but in the team that they 
hire to write, edit and administrate 
that content for the paper. In all of 
our efforts to expand content and 
staff, we must be adamant about 
centering the Black and Indigenous 
voice — especially those of womxn. 
As the MiC section, we also want 
to hold each section accountable 
for this responsibility as individual 
groups — it is not enough to have 
Michigan in Color at the paper; 
this work must be demonstrated by 
each and every section at the paper. 
Simply put, MiC cannot and will 
not be your excuse or your teacher. 
We must treat MiC as an individual 
section which operates on our own 
basis. We are not diversity issue 

scapegoats and we must operate as 
a whole group to rectify our wrong-
doings for a greater future. 
But 
this 
conversation 
and 
demand 
for 
accountability 
is 
far greater than the paper — we 
would like to inspire a bigger call 
to action for our readers, as this 
time is one to take advantage of. 
We have sat comfortably for too 
long in great periods of perfor-
mative activism. As we continue 
to stand complacent in the visual 
apologies granted to us by large 
corporations and brand names who 
participate in oppressive systems, 
we ourselves perpetuate them and 
we ultimately oppress one another. 
Amidst this pandemic and simul-
taneous civil rights and liberation 
movements sprouting globally, we 
have been given the opportunity 
to demand more from ourselves, 
from one another and from those 
who puppeteer these systems. We 
encourage you to be intentional 
and reflective with each pursuit 
of activism you engage in: Is this 
truly the most beneficial way for 
you to wield your privilege and/or 
space for the liberation movement 
at hand? 

Bon Appétit: how racism 
hides behind the screen

On 
Thursday, 
popular 
food 
magazine Bon Appétit lost three 
employees of color as a result of 
racial discrimination in the work-
place and weeks of unsuccessful 
contract negotiations. The news 
comes two months after a 2013 
Instagram photo of Adam Rapo-
port, Bon Appétit’s former editor-
in-chief, in brownface resurfaced, 
which sparked criticism around 
the publication’s systemic racism 
and calls for Rapoport’s resigna-
tion by staffers. Soon after, the staff 
of the magazine posted a public 
statement on Instagram recog-
nizing their complicity in a racist 
workplace culture and planning to 
make change for their BIPOC staff-
ers as they “begin to dismantle rac-
ism.” 
With over 6 million Youtube 
subscribers, the Bon Appétit chan-
nel has amassed a large following 
— many of whom watch their Test 
Kitchen series featuring video con-
tributors of color Priya Krishna, 
Sohla El-Waylly and Rick Marti-
nez. Amidst the magazine’s dec-
laration in early June to instill an 
equitable work environment for 
BIPOC staffers, the three chefs 
went into weeks of contract negoti-
ations asking for compensation and 
video appearances equal to what 
the publication offered their white 
counterparts. However, Bon Appé-
tit and its parent company, Condé 
Nast, failed to meet their demands. 
El-Waylly, a Bengali-American 
assistant editor, publicly accused 
the magazine of only compensat-

ing white editors who appear in 
the Test Kitchen videos and not the 
people of color. She also revealed 
that, even with over fifteen years 
of professional experience, she 
was making a salary of $50,000 
to assist white editors with much 
less experience. She believes she 
was “pushed in front of video as 
a display of diversity” and told 
BuzzFeed News how they asked 
her to stand in the background 
of photo shoots and video shoots 
amongst other exploitive measures 
for tasks she did not sign up nor get 
paid for. After speaking out about 
her mistreatment, she received 
a new contract offer on June 8, 
which included a raise but nothing 
close to the salary of her white co-
workers. Consequently, El-Waylly 
recently announced she would no 
longer be appearing in Bon Appétit 
videos but would still be contribut-
ing to the magazine’s recipes and 
articles. 
Krishna and Martinez report-
edly received offers on June 8, 
which would have guaranteed 10 
video appearances per year — sig-
nificantly less than their white 
co-workers, some of whom were 
guaranteed up to 60 appearances. 
Both refused to accept these offers. 
In a Twitter post, Krisha, an Indi-
an-American food writer, stated 
their diversity and equity plans 
were “all lip service” and said the 
contract would actually give her 
a lower wage than how much she 
currently earns. She also stated 
how non-white members...

Despite being physically distanced 
from my family, I am hopeful that 
I’ll still be able to recall their moral 
guidance while simultaneously 
developing my character and find-
ing myself in an overwhelmingly 
new environment. 
Initially, I perceived my family’s 
Middle Eastern values as a sort 
of setback when thinking about 
beginning college. I felt as though 
I had a reputation to uphold and 
the pressure to behave in which-
ever way would make my parents 
the happiest.

Understanding burn-out for BIPOC womxn

 Design by Hibah Chughtai

This summer has held some of 
the ugliest as well as the most radi-
cally beautiful moments of my life 
thus far. In its entirety, this season 
has taken it out of me. By it, I mean 
my energy, my tears, my heartache 
and my time. While I appreciated 
all of the work I was doing while 
trying to cope with living in a pan-
demic, I can’t say that I always did 
it well. I have a habit of dropping off 
the grid for periods of time, letting 
myself drift into a hermetic state 
and only popping back up after sev-
eral days. It is even harder for me 
to name this as something that is a 
symptom of larger problems rather 
than a quirky flaw that I have. I get 
burned out, and instead of dealing 
with guilt or stress, I disappear. 
Over the past few weeks, I have 
had this conversation with multi-
ple friends who identify as womxn, 
and there seems to be a recurring 
pattern. We put so much pressure 
on ourselves to be the best stu-
dents, look beautiful always, advo-
cate for ourselves, live as models 
of what womxn should be, act as 
supports for our friends and family 
and thrive romantically. I am not 
saying all of these equally affect 
all womxn or that they encompass 
all of our troubles, but I acknowl-

edge that they’re deeply real. The 
spinning plates of life are hard to 
grapple with and contribute to this 
burnout. When I say burnout, I am 
referring to the World Health Orga-
nization’s definition, of a syndrome 
of chronic workplace stress that 
has not been well managed and has 
led to energy depletion, exhaustion, 
as well as other symptoms. Women 
are more likely to experience burn-
out than their counterparts, par-
ticularly in the workplace. We hold 
ourselves to the highest standards, 
both at home and at work, and we 
so often are not recognized for our 
efforts. This is an exhausting cycle 
to live within, and it is impossible 
not to be tired from it. Womxn, 
especially womxn who identify as 
black, Indigenous and people of 
color, hold themselves to a stan-
dard that is unattainable, but we 
don’t know any other way to be. We 
were taught to try to thrive with 
breadcrumbs, tricked into believ-
ing there was only so much to go 
around so we would have to settle 
with less. We were made to believe 
that by making ourselves smaller, 
there would be ways for us to slip 
between the cracks and make it 
through. In reality, shaping our-
selves to the cisgender, white, het-
eropatriarchal system only means 
erasing or drowning out aspects 
of our cultures, histories and iden-

from wrong when our parents 
couldn’t. I learned early on not 
to use words that can hurt other 
people and the importance of fam-
ily because of you. For helping me 
pass through every step of school 
by proofreading my essays, pushing 
me to think about my career and 
giving me general life lessons when 
they were most timely. I learned 
to be a functional adult because of 
you. For covering for me whenever 
I needed support, whether that be 
when my car broke down in the 
middle of Ohio without our parents 
knowing or when you invited me to 
your apartment in Chicago and let 
me get away from the noise of col-
lege. I always know the first per-
son I can call because of you. For 
always dealing with our parents in 
the most civil way and never saying 
anything without precise calcula-
tion. I recognized the significance 
of emotional intelligence because 
of you.

I was raised by you and our 
mom, although at very different 
levels. While our mom bore the 
responsibility of being an author-
ity figure in the household, you are 
the one who could empathize with 
me as my equal — who shares many 
of the same childhood memories 
that I vaguely remember. You take 
all of what someone else might 
perceive as my flaws and make 
me feel comfortable with them. 
You forgive me for not speaking 
as much, knowing I enjoy time to 
myself, but still somehow earnestly 
push me to escape my bubble. You 
respect my decisions, fears and 
dreams no matter how irrational 
or unplanned they may be, vowing 
instead to work through them with 
me. You stand as an equal no mat-
ter how much older and more suc-
cessful you become and never let 
distance keep us apart.
All relationships change with 
time, but I know you will always 

tities. I think burnout in BIPOC 
womxn has everything to do with 
being told to change ourselves to fit 
an oppressive system. 
The first step in realizing there 
is a problem is naming it. Nam-
ing that we suffer from burnout 
gives us back our power. It lets us 
recognize that we are human and 
all of the effort and toil we put in 

does place stress upon us. I found 
that when I name my burnout and 
take care of myself best is when

What postponement means for college athletics, Michigan

The Big Ten made it official on 
Tuesday, ending days of speculation 
and contradicting reports with a 
decision to postpone the fall season. 
In a perfect world, that would be the 
end of all the questions and things 
would be cut and dried.
But it isn’t a perfect world, it’s the 
NCAA.
And that means this decision 
opens up a whole lot of questions that 
Michigan’s athletic department — 
and every other athletic department 
in the Big Ten — hoped it would 
never need to answer. Most of them 
don’t have answers yet, but we tried 
our best to lay them out, with what 
we know right now.
Why was this decision made?
Put simply, because America 
didn’t get COVID-19 under control. 
Back in March, when winter sports 
shut down, nobody thought fall 
sports would be cancelled. When 
Korea brought back professional 
baseball, Germany brought back 
soccer and the rest of Europe’s top 
leagues soon followed, case numbers 
in the US were steadily declining 
through May — things still looked 
good. Then things took a turn for 
the worse in July, when the effects of 
states relaxing lockdowns and social 
distancing took hold, and some 
refused to impose or continue mask 
mandates.
On top of that, this is still a virus 
we’re learning about as we go. It’s 
become almost conventional wisdom 
that it doesn’t affect kids badly, and 
certainly the mortality rate is low 
among the college age population. 
But recent studies have indicated 
increased risk of myocarditis, an 
inflammation of the heart muscle. 
College administrators have seen 
those studies, and that played a role 
here.
Last week, the mother of Indiana 
offensive lineman Brady Feeney 
went viral with a Facebook post 
that detailed her son dealing with 
potential 
heart 
problems 
after 
contracting COVID-19. Incidents 
like that one give colleges pause, 
both from a health and a liability 
perspective. By punting to the 
spring, the Big Ten is giving medical 
experts more time to develop a 
treatment and to understand exactly 
what the lasting effects of COVID-
19 are. It’s also giving the country 
more time to get its act together and 
start putting up numbers in line with 
what, for example, the European 
Union is dealing with instead of the 

tens of thousands of cases America 
has every day.
What are the chances a spring 
season actually happens?
Nobody knows. Anybody who 
says they do is lying.
If the reaction from coaches, 
players and politicians — including 
the President — right now is any 
indication, it will take a lot of 
political will to completely cancel the 
season. The financial ramifications 
would be massive, though athletic 
departments are already dealing 
with major hits from the NCAA 
Tournament cancellation. But the 
bottom line is, there needs to be 
confidence that a season can happen 
safely.
As many have pointed out, 
you can’t bubble college athletes. 
They’re unpaid student-athletes, a 
distinction the NCAA would very 
much like to keep intact. Colleges 
across 
the 
country, 
including 
Michigan, are bringing students 
back in a matter of weeks. Some have 
already done so. If those students all 
get sent home by the end of October 
because of outbreaks, are we really 
going to have a football season in the 
spring?
Without major changes with 
regard to a vaccine or therapy for 
COVID-19 or a dramatic decline 
in case numbers, it’s hard to see a 
coherent argument for doing that. 
On the other hand, if the SEC and 
Big 12 go ahead and have a full season 
without a disaster happening, it’s 
hard to see why the Big Ten wouldn’t 
want to follow suit.
If nothing else, the Big Ten bought 
itself valuable time by postponing its 
schedule.

What does this mean for winter 
sports?
Nothing good.
Unlike football, soccer and field 
hockey, most winter sports are 
indoors — where the virus spreads 
easier. Smaller rosters for sports 
like basketball could make things 
more navigable than, say, football, 
but money from football pays for 
nearly every other sport. So without 
that money guaranteed, would 
administrators want to hold, say, a 
women’s gymnastics season with 
the athletic department facing a 
major revenue loss already? It’s 
unclear right now.
The only rule the Big Ten, and 
the NCAA at large, has seemed to 
adhere to since the pandemic hit is 
that it won’t make a decision until it 
needs to make a decision. And even 
then, it might find a way not to make 
a decision.
All this is to say, speculating about 
winter sports right now is a fool’s 
errand.
Are athletic scholarships still 
being honored?
There’s no reason to believe they 
wouldn’t be. Unlike, for example, 
a professional contract that might 
have an incentive for games played 
or be contingent on appearing in 
games, athletic scholarships aren’t 
dependent on games happening. 
Moreover, pulling them would only 
add to what’s already been a public 
relations nightmare. Ohio State 
quickly released a statement that all 
athletes will remain on scholarship, 
other schools will follow its lead. 
What will the financial impact 
be 
for 
Michigan’s 
athletic 
department?

Much of that depends on whether 
there will actually be a spring 
football season or not. 
If that happens, it means lots of 
TV money. It might even mean some 
fans in the stands if things get better 
in a drastic and unrealistic way.
If that doesn’t happen, the 
revenue shortfall could easily reach 
nine figures. Michigan has already 
budgeted $61 million less than last 
year and athletic director Warde 
Manuel wrote in an open letter last 
week that number “could easily 
double if the decision is made not to 
play any sports.” At Michigan State, 
athletic director Bill Beekman said 
Monday that no football might result 
in an $80-85 million revenue loss.
Michigan likely has the financial 
means to avoid cutting programs, 
but this isn’t the case for everyone 
(nor is it a stone-cold guarantee for 
Michigan). Regardless, the impact 
will be far-reaching, whether there’s 
ultimately a season or not.
What will the football program 
now?
As 
of 
now, 
Michigan 
has 
suspended 
athletic 
activities, 
including 
team 
practices, 
until 
further 
notice. 
The 
release 
announcing so, however, noted 
that the University “will decide 
on organized team and voluntary 
student-athlete activities as soon 
as information becomes available.” 
That leaves the door open for some 
kind of training.
It’s hard to see things shutting 
down altogether the same way 
they did in the spring. As Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh noted in his 
statement Monday, the football team 
has worked out without creating an 

outbreak. Students are still coming 
to campus. There’s not much reason 
not to train.
As those advocating for a season 
have noted, football (and other 
sports) 
give 
players 
structure. 
It forces them to follow social 
distancing protocols. A season could 
still happen in the spring, so might as 
well be ready for that possibility.
What happens with eligibility?
It’s completely unclear right 
now. The Big Ten is in uncharted 
territory. There’s no rules to govern 
whether an early enrollee is allowed 
to play a spring season, because 
there’s never been a spring season. 
There’s no rules to govern whether 
players will retain eligibility in a 
cancelled season because that’s 
never happened either.
In the spring, the NCAA allowed 
athletes to retain eligibility but this 
isn’t necessarily the same. This 
wasn’t a uniform NCAA decision 
and some conferences may play 
in the fall. Moreover, it’s unclear 
whether the Big Ten will be able to 
play in the spring or not.
What happens with the NFL 
Draft?
Again, nobody knows. The NFL 
can push its draft date back as far as 
June 2, but whether it will is another 
story. Whether draft-eligible players 
will want to risk injury in a spring 
season even if the draft gets moved 
back is another matter altogether. 
That will likely depend on each 
individual player.
How do the players feel about 
this?
With the caveat that Michigan’s 
football team shouldn’t be treated 
as a single entity, a vocal contingent 
of players publicly stated on Monday 
that they wanted to play..
A number of players tweeted out 
“#WeWantToPlay” on Monday and 
were joined by Harbaugh, who sent 
a statement outlining the reasons 
he believed a fall season should 
happen. All of them had to do with 
low positive test numbers and strong 
adherence 
to 
protocols 
within 
Michigan’s program.
But Michigan’s football program 
isn’t reflective of every other 
football program in the Big Ten. 
Michigan State and Rutgers both 
had to quarantine after positive 
tests. Elsewhere at Michigan, four 
teams had to pause practices due to 
positive tests. Even if 80 percent of 
players buy into social distancing, a 
few people can ruin it for everyone.
Michigan football seemed to do 
things right. But that alone isn’t 
enough.

Reactions to a devastating day for sports

Sitting on practice field behind 
Schembechler Hall, the Michigan 
football team learned what most 
already knew: Their season — like 
those of the MAC and Mountain 
West — would have to wait. The 
Big Ten, the first Power Five 
conference to do so, postponed 
their season, with hopes of playing 
in the Spring.
They were in the middle of a 
break between practices when the 
news came down. Their meetings 
Tuesday morning went normally, 
avoiding the rumors that had 
circulated the day prior about 
season cancellation, President’s 
votes and rogue teams. The 
second part of their preseason 
schedule, practice, would start at 
3 p.m., but a text from Compliance 
Services brought them back to 
Schembechler slightly earlier. 
“I’m feeling a little conflicted 
because, you know, there’s been 
a lot of work put in and it’s a lot 
of time for us to get right over 
the summer, and it just getting 
canceled randomly –– well, not 
randomly, but getting canceled –– 
has put a toll on our team and our 
morale overall,” offensive lineman 
Trente Jones said. “Right now I’m 
just a little conflicted.”
“We’re 
pretty 
devastated, 
everyone’s 
pretty 
devastated,” 
senior defensive lineman Jess 
Speight said.
“We’re all bummed, but we’re 

taking it day by day,” junior 
quarterback Max Wittwer said. 
“There were rumors, we heard the 
MAC canceled their season and we 
didn’t think it would have any role 
to play in the decision made by the 
Big Ten. We heard all the stuff, we 
just figured that we would surpass 
them, basically.”
The players, like the rest of the 
college football world, are now left 
with questions. About eligibility, 
about when competition returns, 
about practice, about everything. 
And those feelings of devastation, 
dread and loss turned quickly into 
a grasp on what it all means. 
“Right now, we don’t know how 
eligibility is going to work,” Jones 
said. “That’s why a whole bunch of 
the seniors are kind of worried, but 
I feel like the messages have been 
clear with playing and time and 
stuff like that.
“I don’t know how it would 
work with the spring season and 
then having a fall season, or would 
we go to Spring season every year? 
That was my thoughts when I 
initially heard it.”
Michigan 
will 
continue 
to 
practice for 20 hours a week after 
getting clearance from the Big Ten, 
and ultimately finished doing so on 
Tuesday.
While Jones is worried about 
the details, it’s clear from talking 
to the players that they see this as 
simply a delay, a roadblock. That if 
the country does what it needs to, 
there’s a chance that football can 
return and that those 20 hours a 
week will prove vital.
“Any season getting canceled 

is pretty sad,” freshman defensive 
back RJ Moten said. “I mean, it just 
gives us more time to prepare for 
the season and especially the big 
games that we have here.”
But for that to happen, the 
players on Michigan know it’s 
not in their hands. That clichéd 
line “control the controllables” 
will only get them so far. The 
Wolverines 
controlled 
what 
they could, and it still got them a 
canceled season. The frustration is 
clear that what they can’t control 
will end up deciding their sport’s 
feasibility, that this is a problem 
beyond Jim Harbaugh’s office or 
the gridiron.
“I hope (we can play later), 
especially with the whole corona 
thing,” Moten said. “Everybody 
needs to know that it’s serious.”
“It’s very unfortunate about 
how this whole situation was 
handled,” Wittwer said. “I feel if 
they implemented the programs 
and protocols that we had here 
in Schembechler Hall, then this 
really wouldn’t have been an 
issue.”
The heads of Michigan players 
as they left practice weren’t held 
high, smiles didn’t reach past their 
masks and to their eyes. Carrying 
boxes of takeout, they hardly spoke 
as they went to their cars, they 
looked at their feet and pulled out 
of the parking lot quietly. All the 
work they’d put in since last fall, the 
precautions taken as they returned 
to campus, those practices and 
hashtags didn’t work. The dreams 
of a fall season died on the practice 
field behind Schembechler Hall.

Student-athletes call 
for beginning of union 

After a day in which college 
football seemed to be on the 
brink of cancellation, the athletes 
themselves took to social media to 
express two things.
They want to play.
And they want a say in how it’s 
done.
Players from all five power 
conferences joined in posting a 
graphic outlining their wishes for 
the season late Sunday night and 
into the early hours of Monday 
morning.
“We want to play football this 
season,” it reads.
“Establish universal mandated 
health & safety procedures and 
protocols 
to 
protect 
college-
athletes against COVID-19 among 
all conferences throughout the 
NCAA.
“Give players the opportunity to 
opt out and respect their decision.
“Guarantee eligibility whether 
a player chooses to play the season 
or not.
“Use our voices to establish 
open 
communication 
& 
trust 
between players and officials; 
ultimately create a college football 
players association representative 
of all Power 5 conferences.”
Clemson quarterback Trevor 
Lawrence 
and 
Ohio 
State 
quarterback Justin Fields were 
among the high-profile players to 
share the graphic. From Michigan, 
defensive back Hunter Reynolds 

— who helped create the Big 
Ten Unity Proposal — tweeted, 
“#WeWantToPlay and not just P5 
football players. There are athletes 
in other conferences and other 
sports who put in just as much 
effort to have as safe a season as 
possible.”
Earlier on Sunday, multiple 
reports 
indicated 
the 
college 
football season could be postponed 
as early as this week. Big Ten 
commissioner 
Kevin 
Warren 
reportedly favors moving the 
season to the spring, and is said to 
have the backing of the majority of 
presidents in the conference.
Though movements like the Big 
Ten Unity Proposal have gotten 
players meetings with Warren, 
athletes themselves have been left 
out of the actual decision-making 
process — both in the Big Ten and 
in the country at large. That’s no 
surprise. It’s how college athletics 
has worked since its inception. 
And it’s why the idea of a players 
union shakes the very model on 
which the NCAA is built to its 
core.
Amateurism does not comport 
with the notion that athletes are 
employees, with all the rights that 
come with being such. With Name, 
Image and Likeness legislation 
being debated in Congress and the 
COVID-19 pandemic throwing the 
fall season into question, players 
are seizing the moment.
If they can succeed, it’s hard to 
imagine just how far-reaching the 
consequences could be.

Kevin Warren talks about ‘uncertainties’ that led to Big Ten decision

Big Ten commissioner Kevin 
Warren had a lot to say about the 
postponement of sports in the 
conference this fall — unfortunately a 
lot of it translates to ‘We don’t know.’
“This is a holistic decision,” 
Warren said in an interview with 
the Big Ten Network. “There are just 
too many uncertainties now to go 
forward and have fall sports in the 
Big Ten.”
Which essentially just echoed 
what he said in the statement put out 
by the Big Ten today:
“The mental and physical health 
and welfare of our student-athletes 
has been at the center of every decision 
we have made regarding the ability to 
proceed forward. As time progressed 
and after hours of discussion with 
our Big Ten Task Force for Emerging 

Infectious Diseases and the Big 
Ten Sports Medicine Committee, it 
became abundantly clear that there 
was too much uncertainty regarding 
potential medical risks to allow our 
student-athletes to compete this fall.”
Essentially, the Big Ten, along 
with its presidents and chancellors, 
don’t know what the consequences 
of holding fall athletics will be, and 
that makes them worried enough to 
vote the season down. When asked 
whether the vote was unanimous, 
Warren demurred.
“Our schools, we don’t always 
agree.” Warren said. “... But I think 
people understand, and I take that 
from a passion standpoint, that we 
will be together in the Big Ten. So 
I just think it’s important to make 
that very clear. I would rather not 
have a detailed discussion about your 
question of whether the vote was 
unanimous or was it not unanimous.”
Translation for this one: it was 

not unanimous. And it’s pretty well 
known who at least one of the non-
unanimous voters are. Nebraska 
said, in a statement today backed 
by its system president Ted Carter, 
chancellor Ronnie Green, athletic 
director Bill Moos and head football 
coach Scott Frost:
“We are very disappointed in the 
decision by the Big Ten conference 
to postpone the fall football season, 
as we have been and continue to be 
ready to play,” the joint statement 
read.
Michigan 
president 
Mark 
Schlissel confirmed with a statement 
on Tuesday that he voted in favor of 
postponement despite football coach 
Jim Harbaugh advocating playing in 
the fall.
After tip-toeing ever-so gracefully 
around the question surrounding 
unanimous 
voting, 
Warren 
reaffirmed that the season being 
postponed had to deal with many 

factors surrounding the spread of the 
virus, not just one. 
Directly 
addressed 
was 
myocarditis, the heart affliction 
that seems to be worrying medical 
professionals as a possible effect of 
COVID-19, but Warren said the new 
concern over it was not a primary 
reason for the vote, rather just added 
to the many concerns and of course 

“uncertainties.” 
Despite all this lack of certainty 
by the commissioner and conference 
alike, Warren put on a face to assure 
the audience of one final thing about 
the Big Ten before the end of his 
interview:
“We will continue to be absolutely 
dominant, not just academically but 
athletically.”

Ethan Sears: The stories we’ll miss without a fall season

There’s this moment I can’t get out 
of my head. I haven’t been able to for 
five months — not since mid-March, 
when COVID-19 shut down college 
sports. 
It’s 
Duncan 
Robinson, 
and 
he’s standing in 
the far corner, 
poised 
behind 
the 
3-point 
line. There’s a 
little over two 
minutes left and 
Michigan, in a 
packed 
maize 
and blue Staples 
Center, is close — so close — to the 
Final Four. From where I’m sitting, 
up in the auxiliary press box, up near 
the ceiling, you can see Robinson’s 
defender leave him, the ball come to 
him and then float towards the net. 
All those fans down there in maize 
and blue, they lose their collective 
minds. Robinson turns to the bench 
and yells. The game is all but over, and 
that weird, improbable run is going 
to go for another week on the sport’s 
biggest stage. 
In that singular moment back in 
March of 2018, it feels like the whole 
world is coalescing around Michigan 
basketball and every character on that 
team, Duncan Robinson chief among 
them.
That singular moment, it’s why we 
love sports.

Robinson’s story has been told again 
and again. You’ve almost certainly 
heard it before, but as a quick reminder 
we’ll rehash it here. Robinson started 
his college career playing Division 
III ball at Williams College. He 
transferred to Michigan and, after 
sitting a year, worked his way into 
the rotation as a 3-point specialist. 
In his senior year, he struggled and 
got replaced by Isaiah Livers, then 
a freshman, in Michigan’s starting 
lineup. He came off the bench the 
rest of the year, found a key role on a 
team that went to the Final Four, and it 
seemed likely that the story would end 
there. Out of college, he signed a two-
way contract with the Miami Heat 
and seemed consigned to basketball 
purgatory. Then he started hitting 
threes for them, too and now he’s in 
the NBA bubble, playing a key role on a 
playoff team. When his contract is up, 
he’s going to make a ton of money. 
That’s cool as hell.
I’m not telling you this because 
you didn’t already know — this is 
probably the 100th time you’ve heard 
Robinson’s story. I’m talking about 
this now for the same reason I can’t get 
that snapshot out of my head:
When I think about why it’s a shame 
the Big Ten postponed fall sports, I 
think about Duncan Robinson.
Hold on a minute. Don’t laugh. 
I know Duncan Robinson plays a 
winter sport. I understand there’s 
better reasons to have sports or not, 

there’s more at play here than one 
guy’s human interest story. Playing 
sports right now might not be the 
smartest thing. Having students back 
on campus — especially if, like a lot of 
schools, your coronavirus mitigation 
plan amounts to a shoulder shrug and 
an eye roll — might not end well.
The Big Ten’s decision puts moral 
and public health obligations over 
financial gains and, all told, it’s the 
right call. The U.S. has done a terrible 
job at fighting the coronavirus. We’re 
reaping what we sowed, but that 
doesn’t mean we can’t lament it. So 
let’s get back to Duncan Robinson and 
all the other stories that make sports 
worth watching.
Remember when Jordan Poole hit 
the shot? If you’re this far into this 
story, you probably remember where 
you were sitting and who you were 
with. I’ll never forget talking with 

Duncan Robinson after Jordan Poole 
hit the shot.
Robinson had fouled out of the 
game. He thought it’d be his last 
college game, thought he’d been 
partially responsible for a crushing 
loss. The look on his face, the tone 
in his voice when he spoke in the 
locker room. That was something to 
remember.
“I don’t think I’ve ever cried tears 
of joy,” Robinson said that night. “But 
I was damn close.”
Forget, for a minute, about the 
fact that Robinson is now an NBA 
player with an NBA career and all the 
amenities that come with it. Because 
right then, he was a college kid and the 
best thing he’d ever been involved in 
had just gotten improbably extended 
for another week.
Now think about all the athletes 
at Michigan (and elsewhere), all with 

their own stories and hours of work 
and breakthroughs to get to where 
they are, and what they all must 
have been on Tuesday when the 
announcement came down.
Think about Nick Blankenburg, 
a junior defenseman on the hockey 
team who plays every game for his 
grandfather, and Nick Granowicz, his 
teammate, who’s playing for his mom. 
Think about Mohammed Zakyi and 
Omar Farouk Osman, who started 
their soccer careers playing with paper 
bags and folded clothes, and now likely 
won’t have their senior years. Think 
about Paige Jones and all the people 
in New Bremen, Ohio watching her 
play volleyball for Michigan. Think 
about Maddie Nolan working her 
way back from a microfracture to play 
basketball for Michigan.
Think about what they’re feeling 
now, after their fall seasons got 
canceled. Those that play in the winter 
can’t be feeling good about their 
chances of having a season either.
The Big Ten made the right 
decision. But as long as we can 
acknowledge that, let’s also take a 
minute to appreciate all the stories, 
all the players, all the games and 
everything else we won’t get to have 
this year, because it’s all improbable, 
and at any moment it could all be over. 
Now, more than ever.
