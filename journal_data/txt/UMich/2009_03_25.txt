RUNNING A BUSINESS RIGHT
Ross won't
up focus on
ethcsyet
Critics push for revitalized
ethics effort in business schools
after greed helped worsen
the nation's financial crisis
By MALLORY JONES
and DEVON THORSBY
Daily Staff Reporters
As the Federal government bails out many of the
nation's companies and financial institutions, ques-
tions have arisen about the integrity of the people
leading American businesses. In the face of these calls
for a change in the way business operates, the Ross
School of Business is altering the way it teaches its
future business leaders.
An article published in The New York Times on
March 5 suggested business schools nationwide are
adjusting their curricula to instill better business val-
ues in their students. The Ross School of Business is
among these schools, according to professors and stu-
dents in the school.
But while school officials say the downturn is often
discussed in Business School classrooms, they report
that there are no immediate plan's to alter the schools
curricula.
Valerie Suslow, associate dean for degree pro-
grams at the Business School, said the school has
always tried to promote ethical business practices to
its students. According to Suslow, the school has con-
sistently focused on teaching the implications of man-
agement decisions.
"The best business schools are serious about instill-
ing a sense of responsibility and ethics," Suslow said.
"But in the real world, unfortunately, there are some-
times tremendous financial and social incentives that
can work against what we have tried to instill as good
leadership practices."
Suslow said because the events surrounding the
current financial crisis are still unfolding, no new
courses have been created specifically on the topic.
Butwhile no concrete changes have taken place, Sus-

CONCENTRATING IN COLLECTIONS
Calling all curators: 'U'
to offer Museums minor

New concentration
will prepare students
for a variety of
museum-related jobs
By VALIANT LOWITZ
Daily StaffReporter
Beginning in Fall 2009, the Uni-
versity will make an addition to its
already extensive list of undergrad-
uate minors.
The minor in Museum Studies
is an 18-credit-hour program that
will incorporate themes ranging

from museums in society to objects
and collections.
According to the University's
History of Art website, the new
minor's goal will be to teach stu-
dents the purpose of museums, in
both a historical and modern con-
text, and prepare them for a number
of careers in museum-related fields.
The minor will also focus on the
ways in which museums add mean-
ing to objects, and how such objects
are redefined within the context of
the museum setting.
Raymond Silverman, director
of the Museum Studies Program
and professor of History of Art
and Afro-American and African

studies, said the minor is open to
all students who are interested in
museum work.
"Being a minor, it's going to be
an introduction to museums," Sil-
verman said, "It will be a stepping
stone into jobs at a range of differ-
ent types of museums, depending
on the interests of the student. A
very conscious decision was made
not to make it a concentration."
He added that the minor will
give students the flexibility to work
in any section of a museum that
interest them.
"Larger museums have a good
deal of specialization," Silver-

At swearing-in
meeting, outgoing
leaders disagree on
the state of assembly
By JENNA SKOLLER
Daily StaffReporter
At a meeting to swear in
Abhishek Mahanti and Michael
Rorro as the new leaders of the
Michigan Student Assembly, the
body's new beginning was juxta-
posed with a difference of opinion
about the current state of MSA by
two people who know it well.
Teary-eyed, outgoing Presi-
dent Sabrina Shingwani said her
four years in MSA were extremely

beneficial because the experience
exposed her to events and causes
and helped her form friendships
with a diverse group of people.
Shingwani stressed the impor-
tance of representatives mak-
ing the most of their time on the
assembly. She said representatives
should realize MSA's powerto cre-
ate change on campus and make it
their responsibility to bring about
that change.
"Look through the old minutes
and you will be overwhelmed by
everything that MSA has accom-
plished until now," she said. "It's
up to you to carry on that legacy of
hard work."
Outgoing Vice President Arvind
Sohoni said MSA helped him form
lasting friendships, but that he
doesn't feel that MSA effectively

serves the needs of the students to
its fullest extent.
"I leave knowing that we're
still a little bit short of reaching
our potential," he said. "We're
in a body far too concerned with
our internal struggles, whether it
be the latest code change or our
retreats, neither of which has a
direct effect on our student con-
stituents."
"In my mind, MSA should have
two fundamental goals: first, to
serve the student body in the most
effective, efficient way possible,
second, to develop experienced
student leaders," Sohoni contin-
ued. "At this point, I'm not sure
we're doing either as effectively as
we would like."

NEWS BRIEFS
. DETROIT
GM begins white-
collar layoffs with
160 pink slips
Dreaded white-collar job cuts at
General Motors Corp. started yes-
terday as the wounded automaker
began to deliver on promises to
the government to shrink its work
force so it can be profitable at lower
sales levels.
Yesterday morning, GM told 160
people at its manufacturing engi-
neeringoperations inWarrenMich.,
that they would be laid off as of April
1, spokesman Tom Wilkinson said.
It's the beginning of 3,400 sala-
ried layoffs in the U.S. and part of
the 47,000 job cuts that GM wants
to accomplish worldwide by the
end of the year, Wilkinson said.
"It will impact every area of
" the business. Some of those will
be through normal attrition, but
there will be a significant number
of involuntary separations coming
from now through the early part of
May," Wilkinson said.
WASHINGTON
Iverson ordered to
pay $260K for
bar fight in 2005
NBA star Allen Iverson must pay
$260,000 for standing idly by and
watching his bodyguard beat up
another man in a 2005 bar fight, a
federal appeals court ruled yester-
Wday.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit
rejected the Detroit Pistons guard's
attempt to throw out the verdict
decided by a jury in 2007.
Bar patron Marlin Godfrey
accusedIverson'sbodyguard,Jason
Kane, of punching, kicking and hit-
ting him with a bottle because he
refused to vacate the VIP section
at Washington club Eyebar to make
way for the basketball star and
his entourage. Godfrey suffered a
concussion, a ruptured eardrum, a
burst blood vessel in his eye, a torn
rotator cuff, cuts and bruises, and
emotional injuries.
A three-judge appeals court
panel wrote that Iverson stayed out
of the fray in the back corner of the
VIP area, standing on a couch or
bench and observing.
DETROIT
Woman gets three
years probation for
hosting sex party
A woman accused of hosting a
party at her Detroit home featur-
ing lap dances, sex and her par-
tially nude 16-year-old daughter
has been sentenced to three years'
probation.
Wayne County Circuit Judge
Thomas Jackson yesterday sen-
tenced the woman, who pleaded
guilty last month to maintaining or
operating a house of ill fame.
Jackson also sentenced Samuel
Benning, who was arrested at the
Dec. 7 party, to at least one year in

prison. The Detroit man pleaded
guilty to drug and other charges.
Jackson found Stanley Ferguson
of Detroit guilty in a bench trial of
an alcohol charge. He will be sen-
tenced April 16.
FARGO, N.D.
City comes together
in race against river
As the swelling Red River lapped
within 30 feet of his back door, Car-
lis Kramer's property resembled
nothing so much as a bustling con-
struction site.
In a well-ordered ballet, four
people loaded sandbags, four others
hauled them to the house and anoth-
er person stacked them into a dike.
This is how Fargo responds to
the threat of record flooding: Hun-
dreds of people from all walks of
life have joined forces to shield the
community from the rising river,
racing to fill 2 million sandbags.
The effort has drawn football
players, soldiers, high school stu-
dents, even a Microsoft engineer
- all fearful of enduring another
disaster like the devastating floods
of 1997.
"A friend of mine brought his
neighbor's kids, and friends of
family bring boyfriends and girl-
friends," Kramer said.
The 1997 floods forced tens of
thousands of people to flee homes
in North Dakota, Minnesota and
southern Canada in one of the cost-
liest and largest flood evacuations
in U.S. history before Hurricane
Katrina.

Insurers offer to stop
charging the sick more

Proposal introduced
in a letter to key
senators yesterday
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
health insurance industry offered
yesterday for the first time to
curb its controversial practice
of charging higher premiums to
people with a history of medical
problems.
The offer from America's
Health Insurance Plans and the
Blue Cross and Blue Shield Asso-
ciation is a potentially significant
shift in the debate over reforming
the nation's health care system
to rein in costs and cover an esti-
mated 48 million uninsured peo-
ple. It was contained in a letter to
key senators.
In the letter, the two insurance
industry groups said their mem-
bers are willing to "phase out the
practice of varying premiums
based on health status in the indi-
vidual market" if all Americans
are required to get coverage.
"The offer here is to transition
away from risk rating, which is
one of the things that makes life
hell for real people," said health

economist Len Nichols of the
New America Foundation public
policy center. "They have never
in their history offered to give up
risk rating."
Insurers are trying to head
off the creation of a government
insurance plan that would com-
pete with them, something that
liberals and many Democrats
are pressing for. To try to win
political support, the industry
has already made a number of
concessions. Last year, for exam-
ple, insurers offered to end the
practice of denying coverage to
sick people. They also said they
would support a national goal of
restraining cost increases.
The latest offer goes beyond
that.
Insurance companies now
charge very high premiums to
people who are tryingto purchase
coverage as individuals and have a
history of medical problems, such
as diabetes or skin cancer. Even if
such a person is offered coverage,
that individual is often unable to
afford the high premiums. About
7 percent of Americans buy their
coverage as individuals, while
more than 60 percent have job-
based insurance.

"This changes everything,"
said Karen Ignagni, president
of America's Health Insurance
Plans, the leading trade group.
"When you have everyone in
the system, and you can bring
(financial) assistance to working
families, then you can move away
health status rating."
The companies leftthemselves
several outs, however. The letter
said they would still charge dif-
ferent premiums based on such
factors as age, place of residence,
family size and benefits pack-
age.
And importantly, the industry
did not extend to small business-
es their offer to stop charging
the sick higher premiums. Small
employers who offer coverage
can see their premiums zoom up
from one year to the next, even if
just one worker or family mem-
ber gets seriously ill.
Ignagni said the industry is
working on separate proposals
for that problem.
"We are in the process of talk-
ing with small business folks
across the country," she said. "We
are well on the way to proposing
a series of strategies that could be
implemented for them."

Geithner, Bernanke
call for increased
oversight of U.S.
financial companies
WASHINGTON (AP) - Point-
ing with dismay to the AIG deba-
cle, the nation's top economic
Sofficials argued yesterday- for.
unprecedented powers to regulate
and even take over financial goli-
aths whose collapse could imperil
the entire economy. President
Barack Obama agreed and said he
hoped "it doesn't take too long to
convince Congress."
Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner and Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke, in a
rare joint appearance before a
House committee, said the messy
federal intervention into Ameri-
can International Group, an
insurance giant, demonstrated
a need to regulate complex non-
bank financial institutions just
as banks are now regulated by
the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.
"AIG highlights broad failures
of our financial system," Geithner
told the House Financial Services
Committee. "We must ensure that
our countrynever faces this situa-
tion again."
But the two appeared divided
over where the authority should

reside. Geithner suggested his
Treasury Department's powers
be expanded. Bernanke was non-
committal, even suggesting the
FDIC.
Both officials sought to channel
the widespread public outrage over
the millions of dollars AIG spent
in post-bailout bonuses into sup-
port for regulatory overhaul. Gei-
thner was expected to lay out more
details on the administration's plan
Thursday when he appears again
before the committee.
Democrats in the Senate say
the administration wants the
proposal on taking over non-
banks to move separately from
the larger financial industry reg-
ulatory bill, to get it going more
quickly.
At the White House, Obama
told reporters, "We are already
hard at work in putting forward
a detailed proposal. We will work
in consultation with members
of Congress. That will be just

ro

-ision passed by a
-507 vote, makes
om for broader
government

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's
Labor Party voted yesterday to
join the incoming government
of Benjamin Netanyahu, lending
a moderate voice to a coalition
dominated by hard liners and eas-
ing concerns of a head-on con-
frontation with Washington over
Mideast peacemaking.
Chants of "Disgrace! Dis-
grace!" echoed through the
convention hall after Defense
Minister Ehud Barak pushed
through the proposal despite
angry opposition from party
activists who feared Labor would
give only a superficial gloss to a
government little interested in
movingtoward peace.
Labor's move gives Netanya-
hu's coalition a majority of 66 in
the 120-seat parliament.
Labor's decision, by a 680-
507 vote, paves the way for a
broader government than the
narrow and hawkish one Netan-
yahu would otherwise have
had to settle for, increasing his
chances of gaining international
acceptance.
Barak was set to remain
defense minister, a key position
in the new Cabinet, that could
allow Labor to promote peace
efforts with the Palestinians.
On the other hand, the
expected appointment of Avig-
dor Lieberman as foreign min-
ister could overshadow Barak's
input. Lieberman is widely per-
ceived as a racist because of his
demands that Israel's minority
Arabs take a loyalty oath or for-
feit their citizenship.
Yesterday, Jewish extremists
marched through the north-
ern Israeli-Arab town of Umm
el-Fahm, demanding residents
show loyalty to Israel and set-
ting off stone-throwing protests
by Arab youths that police dis-

persed with stun grenades and
tear gas. No serious injuries were
reported, butresidents denounced
the march on one of Israel's larg-
est Arab communities.
In Israel, the prime minister
sets the tone for his government,
and Netanyahu remains deeply
skeptical about negotiations with
the Palestinians. The past year of
U.S.-backed talks have produced
no discernible results, because
the leadership of both sides
appeared too weak to make the
necessary concessions on vital
issues like borders, refugees and
settlements.

Netanyahu claims the Palestin-
ians are not ready for statehood
and suggests economic develop-
ment instead. The Palestinians
reject that and have received the
backing of Secretary of State Hil-
lary Rodham Clinton. She empha-
sized several times during a visit
here this month that the Obama
administration's goal is creation
of a Palestinian state that would
live in peace next to Israel.
Yesterday's contentious vote
drove a wedge through Barak's
Labor party, opening the way for
a possible split - if not now, then
in the future.

FR 'M THEDlY
Opening the door
Diverse viewpoints have value in the academic world
Y ou may remember the Patriot Act - President George
W. Bush's overzealous, freedom-curtailing response to
national security threats. The act resulted in many prom-
inent intellectual voices being kept out of the country based solely
on their personal ideologies. But last Wednesday, in a letter to the
Obama administration, the American Civil Liberties Union joined
with other civil rights and free speech groups to protest these
McCarthy-esque ideological-exclusion policies left over from the
Bush administration. It's imperative that the Obama administra-
tion overturns this prejudiced protocol in favor of promoting tol-
erance, academic freedom and diversity.

Fun, fearless and flawed

Ideological-exclusion policies were
authorized as part of the Patriot Act under
the Bush administration in 2001 to pre-
vent the immigration of people with cer-
tain ideological values. The logic behind
the policy is that these people have beliefs
that make them dangerous. But in prac-
tice, prominent intellectuals seeking to
visit American universities and confer-
ences have been turned away at the border
for no good reason. Last Wednesday, doz-
ens of organizations, including the ACLU,
the Center for Campus Free Speech and
the National Education Association, sent
a letter to administration officials detail-
ing their opposition to these policies. The
ACLU's letter also requests a re-evaluation
of cases already decided under this poli-
cy, including one scheduled for court this
week.
Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss intellectual
who is Muslim, was invited to speak at
the University of Notre Dame but was
denied-entrance to the United States in
2004. Adam Habib, a South African politi-
cal critic, was also denied a visa in 2007.
If the only difference between citizens and
intellectuals who have been turned away is
that one holds an American passport and
the other does not, this standard is clearly
wrong. In the name of academic freedom,
these intellectuals must be allowed to enter
the nation, or we won't be able to benefit
from their intelligence, insights and, yes,
criticism.
This sort of isolationist behavior is detri-

mental to society. To increase understand-
ing of different cultures, the government
has to lead the way in fostering open
debate. Listening to and accepting criti-
cism from people with different beliefs is
the only way to increase our understand-
ing of others. By censoring these views,
the government effectively discriminates
against those with different beliefs, add-
ing fuel to the fires of extremism - which
actually can be dangerous. Closing our
borders to diversity only increases igno-
rance and fear.
It's the role of universities to provide
students with access to ideological per-
spectives that they might not otherwise
encounter. This is an impossible mission
to fulfill if the government so strictly
screen applicants to enter the U.S. based
solely on ideology. In order to create
students who are truly well rounded,
universities' right to sponsor controver-
sial speakers and teachers must not be
infringed so drastically.
Not everyone who criticizes America is
a danger to our nation. The Bush admin-
istration's assumption that everyone who
criticizes America is dangerous was clum-
sy and offensive - and Obama must revive
America's international image by discard-
ing this discriminatory practice. For eight
years America's borders have been closed
and America has suffered. It's time to open
our borders and our eyes to the rest of the
world, including those who challenge our
views.

Cosmopolitan's continued pop-
ularity in the modern age as
a "woman's magazine" has
long mystified me.
Despite the gener-
alized testimonies
of douchebaggy
pick-up-artists,
women are an
extremely varied
group of people -
shocking, I know,
especially consid- EILEEN
ering we comprise
half the freaking STAHL
planet. So until
recently, I was
completely clueless as to what univer-
sal womanly trait Cosmo's marketing
team could be cashing in on. After
some careful thought, I've realized
that Cosmo could be craftier than it
looks. Rather than a superficial love
of shoes, the magazine may actually
be catering to a deep-seated biologi-
cal and emotional urge among women
that even I subscribe to. The thing is,
Cosmo doesn't handle this in the most
stellar way.
I should mention my legendary
love-hate relationship with Cosmo. I
eagerly devour each new issue so that
I can rant about how it isn't fit to be
used for kindling. My main beef with
Cosmo is that it claims to be for fun,
fearless, independent women and yet
devotes a huge amount of space (sev-
eral feature articles and an entire
section called the "Man Manual")
to the capture and keeping of men.
The number of techniques devoted to
"man snaring" is depressingly ridic-
ulous, offering advice ranging from
the decent (don't sleep with him on
the first date) to the cringe-worthy (if
you want him to call you back, always
wear high heels) I can't imagine how
a Cosmo Girl can be fearless when
she's constantly analyzing her boy-
friend's "hand holding technique."
So I was very surprised to find
myself agreeing with the majority
of an April 2009 article "The 50 Best
Relationship Tips Ever." Some of them

were fairly obvious but nonetheless
true, like number 24, which pointed
out that men don't have a psychic
mind-reading mechanism to know
what you want for your birthday.
Others were more poignant, such as
"deliver an ultimatum to geta commit-
ment only if you're prepared to walk
away." I thumbed through the rest of
the magazine, as well as a few back
issues I've kept in order to write this
very column, and realized the articles
I could get behind were all devoted to
relationships, not dating.
It was then I realized that Cosmo's
boy craziness is marketed to the
"female" desire for a healthy rela-
tionship. There is a small but vocal
group among feminists that claim
this yearning is artificial and wrong,
and that the only women who sub-
scribe to it have been duped by the
conniving minds of patriarchy. Actu-
ally, it's quite real and has its basis in
evolutionary biology. Since women
carry and nourish a baby, finding a
man to protect her while in this vul-
nerable state meant the difference
between life and death for a woman
and her offspring. Men, on the other
hand, could take the "quantity over
quality" approach.
Of course, that raises the point that
there's also an "evolutionary basis"
for your boyfriend to impregnate the
entire cheerleading team, so let me
stress that evolutionary biology just
explains why we think about rela-
tionships more than men, not that
we're the only ones who want them.
Actually, I'm of the opinion that most
emotionally mature adults will ben-
efit from spending their lives with
someone else. Having a good partner
in life means more than just compan-
ionship or having a live-in pickle jar-
opener. Another humanbeingsharing
your life means that you will always
have someone who offers you unique
insight on your shared experiences,
providing a fantastic opportunity
for new perspectives and personal
growth. Those who enjoy such a
beautiful connection tend to con-

sider themselves lucky, and not just
women in relationships with men. In
fact, when you take homosexual rela-
tionships into account, there doesn't
have to be male involvement at all.
My love-hate
relationship with
Cosmo magazine.
So I'm fine with Cosmo wanting to
help ladies maintain their. relation-
ships. What I have a problem with is
their apparent obsession with find-
ing a man right now, which perme-
ates the magazine so much that even
the "Single Girl's Bible" usually fea-
tures some how-to-land-a-dateable-
guy advice. While relationships are
lovely, it obviously isn't healthy to
want to get into them like your life
depends on it. Seeing as most rela-
tionships end in failure, people who
are only happy when they're dating
can count on being miserable a lot.
Plus, if you're not comfortable with
the person you are when you're sin-
gle, when you do get into a relation-
ship you won't exactly offer the other
person a lot of growth opportunities.
I dated a guy at a similar point in
my life, and all I could do was glibly
agree with every (often questionable)
point he made.
I maintain that Cosmo has a lot of
room for improvement, both in terms
of its man craziness and its diet pill
advertisements every ten pages. But
perhaps because tm now dating
someone wonderful myself, I realize
that women shouldn't feel ashamed
for wanting advice on making their
relationship a success, and Cosmo
is sometimes good at offering that.
Now if they'd only sort through their
dependency issues.

TO THE DAILY:
Upon picking up Tuesday's copy of the Daily, I
was disappointed to see yet another half-thought-
outfilmcriticismbyBlakeGoble (Playingfor keeps,
03/24/2009). What irritated me was not so much
the list of films but rather his arrogance and dis-
respect for his readers. In the article, he names
the best sports films ever made. He bases these
claims on four rules which are seemingly picked
at random: "No Kevin Costner films. No Boxing
films..." He offers no reason for dismissing sports
classics like "Field of Dreams", "Million Dollar
Baby" or "Raging Bull." Was he merely trying to
be a contrarian? Not only is his list illogical, but
he flaunts his unrivaled arrogance: "Don't like
the rules? Tough. I don't have to justify them."
Apparently, the Daily's film criticism has
shrunken to the level of two middle school kids
arguing on the back of a bus while on their way
to school. I can hardly fault Mr. Goble for having
personal tastes, but as a film critic, his articles
should have some sort of coherency and govern-
ing logic. Examining the work of any good film
critic, one will discover this logic. When a critic
provides no rational for their judgements, they
become merely a snob. And that's the last thing
I want to read.

TO THE DAILY:
I was disappointed to open my copy of the
Daily on Monday morning to find no mention
of the 17th Big Ten Championship title won by
the women's gymnastics team. Under the lead-
ership of coach Bev Plocki, this team has won
the last three conference titles.
With much of the team starting their sea-
son recovering from surgery, the Wolverines
entered the competition this past weekend in
Champaign as the underdogs. But the entire
team stepped up to score a season-best 197.075
when they needed it most.
This victory was highlighted by individual
wins from Trish Wilson, who scored a 9.95
on the uneven bars, and Kylee Botterman,
who scored a 9.95 on floor and came in 2nd all
around.
Both Wilson and Botterman returned this
season from major injuries. Yet there was no
mention of these feats anywhere to be found in
the Daily.
These girls deserve to be recognized for
their incredible determination and for refusing
to ever change their goals. So I send them my
highest congratulations - and the Daily ought
to be ashamed that it didn't beat meto it.

MSA CAMPUS SAFETY COMMISSION VIEWC
Lobby for car
one of the most prominent complaints from the stu-
dent body in recent years has been the lack of action
about poor street lighting in some off-campus neighbor-
hoods. Although there haven't been many visible results
to date, the Michigan Student Assembly has been working
diligently on the issue for months. We are optimistic that
we will all begin to see brighter streets by the end of this
semester.
It has been a difficult problem to fix, due in part to both
a lack of funding in the city budget and the inherent dif-
ficulties with navigating the city bureaucracy. Through
our efforts, we are close to finalizing the installation of
additional city streetlights in the neighborhood south of
Hill Street.
These lights will reach some of the darkest areas, such
as the triangle intersection of East University, Oakland
and Tappan streets.
While the new city lights will undoubtedly make the
streets safer, the MSA Campus Safety Commission is
committed to doing much more to ensure that students
have a safe way to walk home every night. Doing so will
require help from all of you.
The MSA CSC has launched a project to ensure that
every off-campus house and apartment building is
equipped with an automatic porch light that turns on by
itself at night and off in the morning. These lights will act
as a deterrent against home invasions, especially during
breaks when many houses would ordinarily be completely
dark.
Additionally, these lights will contribute to making the
streets brighter and safer. Imagine how much of a differ-
ence would be made by installing lights in the front of
each house.
After securing the funds to provide property owners

npus lighting
and management companies with the light sensors at no
cost, the MSA CSC contacted a number of them through
the mail to ask for support in our efforts. A meeting in the
fall with a large contingent of local landlords and prop-
erty managers regarding the lighting issue encouraged
MSA's belief that we would get a sizable buy-in for this
project.
Sadly, this was not the case. It has now been over a
month since we sent letters asking for participation and
we have only received one response, albeit a very positive
one.
Dan of Dan's Houses has committed to installing the
sensors on nearly 75 properties located in off-campus
neighborhoods.
So we are reaching out to students to ask for their help.
We now need you to lobby your landlords and manage-
ment companies to participate in this project. We need
you to call, e-mail or visit your landlords to voice your
concerns about dark streets and to tell them that you want
an automatic porch light from MSA.
Ensure landlords that the cost to them is nearly noth-
ing - we provide the sensor for free and your landlord
puts it on an existing socket and bulb. All landlords are
required to do is send an e-mail to campussafety@umich.
edu and the sensors will be ordered and delivered to them
as quickly as possible.
Please take one minute out of your day to reach out
to your landlord so that we can truly take a step toward
making the night bright.
Students with questions about this project can e-mail
the MSA CSC at campussafety@umich.edu.
This viewpoint was submitted on behalf of
the MSA Campus Safety Commission.

Opposite Clive Owen, Julia Roberts makes
'Duplicity' an unlikely success
By Kavi Pandey I Daily Arts Writer

In a world where most films
middlingly muddle within a single
genre, "Duplic-
ity" achieves a
near-impossible * *
feat: It manages
to be a sweet Duplicity
romantic com-
edy, an intelli- AtQuality16
gent crime-caper and Showcase
and an eye- Universal
opening social
commentary all at the same time.
This inspired genre-balancing,
combined with exceptional per-
formances, makes "Duplicity" a
tremendously entertaining film.
The movie begins with MI6
agent Ray Koval (Clive Owen,
"The International") hooking up
with a woman named Claire Sten-
wick (Julia Roberts) in Dubai.
Stewick turns out to be a CIA.
agent whose mission was to sleep
with Koval and steal state secrets
from him. Years later, the two
find themselves working as spies

for rival pharmaceutical and cos-
metic corporations led by Tom
Wilkinson ("Valkyrie") and Paul
Giamatti ("Sideways"). Koval and
Stenwick end up working togeth-
er, albeit grudgingly, to con a very
large payload out of their respec-
tive bosses. Twists come early and
often, though, and what's happen-
ing on the surface is usually quite
different than the reality.
With "Duplicity," Julia Roberts
has finally emerged from hiber-
nation and reclaimed her throne
as a leading lady in Hollywood.
She exudes the same combination
of beauty, wit and toughness that
defined her stardom in "Pretty
Woman" and "Erin Brockovich."
It's nice to have her back, and
she more than matches the gruff,
forceful performance of co-star
Clive Owen.
Anyone who has seen the
"Extras" series finale knows how
maddeningly hilarious Owen can
be (if you haven't, watch it now).

In "Duplicity," Owen shows off
his comedic talents, swapping his
trademark scowl for a mischievous
grin that rivals Roberts's famous
smile. Owen is sure to bring audi-
ences to tears with his attempt at
a slow Southern drawl (which is
part of a disguise he uses to seduce
a woman). It's a pleasant surprise
to see his character as the sensitive
foil to Roberts's more emotionally
detached role. Koval is concerned
with love and relationships, while
Stenwick always seems to be
focused on her work.
Giamatti and Wilkinson also
stand out among a very solid
supporting cast. Giamatti is the
embodiment of the greedy CEO -
a sleazy, hot-tempered man who
only wants to make money and
destroy the competition. In con-
trast, Wilkinson plays a sage-like
businessman with ruthless capa-
bilities. The peak of his career
is long gone and he is becoming
increasingly disillusioned by the
treachery and dishonesty that has
invaded his trade. Their feud is
showcased during a slow-motion
old-man fight that is quite possi-
bly the funniest opening-credits

sequence in cinematic history.
From their line of work, Koval
and Stenwick have learned to trust
nobody, so they constantly question
each other's motives and almost
derail their scheme at several key
moments. That's where "Duplic-
ity" subtly begins its social inspec-
tion, satirizing the deception and
betrayal that plague global busi-
ness. It's both cringe-worthy and
comical to see the corporations in
this movie spend millions of dollars
protecting formulas of skin lotions
and hair-care products from the
competition.
After scoring with "Michael
Clayton," writer and director Tony
Gilroy adds another significant
accomplishment to his resume
with "Duplicity." He has brought
down the house once again with
sly dialogues, fleshed-out charac-
ters and a unique framing struc-
ture that is too cool to be spoiled.
It's disappointing to see such a
terrific film being dumped on a
crowded weekend in March. Even,
though "Duplicity" is too light to
turn heads during the awards sea-
son, it's a remarkably good time at
the cinema.

The 47th AAFF ABC is no better with 'Ted'

goes global on
opening night

By BLAKE GOBLE
Daily Arts Writer
Waiting in line for the night's fes-
tivities, one couldn't help but soak in
the scene. Ahab beards and intricate
scarves were everywhere. Schakolad
flowers were devoured with complimen-
tary wine and beer from Arbor Brewing
Company. Salsa music competed with
an organ player, creating a groovy vibe.
Seva's vegetarian fare met harmoniously
with Totoro's delicious pork and chick-
en. And Ann Arbor's middle-aged literati
got to mingle with teenage freaks to rap
about how cool it is that Bruce Conner is
gonna show up later this week.
All these happenings at the Michigan
Theater could only mean one thing: The
47th Ann Arbor Film Festival opened
Sights, sounds and
sensational food.
last night and, as always, it was a hell of
an event. The opening-night gala recep-
tion was a splendid affair, complete with
all the amenities of a posh and proper
function. At 47 years old, this event felt
as fresh as ever.
The night was like a grand three
course meal. First was the gala, where
Ann Arbor's tastiest treats met with its
most artistically inclined individuals.
Second, the main theater opened and
several speeches ushered in the event.
Finally, opening-night screening selec-
tions brought the affair to an end.
The opening gala was excellent.
The scene was set for a good time and
a geography theme was nicely present
in the design. Google Maps slide shows
went perfectly with inflatable globes
in the Theater lobby. Think geography
class, but cooler. Like Festival Executive
Director Donald Harrison said, this year
was a "new world of indie cinema."

Sights, sounds and sensational food
bombarded the opening crowd. It was
a place to eat sushi during cattle-call
shorts without feeling awkward. The
seemingly smaller number of people
than last year's opening didn't matter.
The word was excitement, and everyone
knew it.
Showcasing this year's international
theme, the Festival's opening speeches
were candid and captivating. Russ Col-
lins, executive director of the Michigan
Theater, graciously welcomed everyone
to the event. Ann Arbor Mayor John
Hieftje did aglobal rollcallwith the audi-
ence. Festival Artistic Director Christen
McArdle shared her excitement, detail-
ing what's happening in this year's pro-
gram. And Donald Harrison emceed the
whole opening, reminding everyone to
take notice of the geography motifs but,
above all, to have a good time.
But in the end, the screenings were
what everyone was there for. Like a
champagne bottle thrown against a boat,
Thomas Oraschen's "Freude" opened
this year's event with a bang. In-your-
face and out of control (with naked ladies
and gorillas), the short was as wildly
eclectic as those that followed.
Stop-motion animation was used to
perfection in Michael Langen's "Cahlia"
and PES's "Western Spaghetti." "Out of
Print," from Danny Plotnick, was the
most accessible work of hipster dismay
this side of "High Fidelity." Pat Rober-
stun and The Weather Underground
showed up too in "P.R." and "Clear
Glasses," respectively. And the inimi-
table Don Hertzfeldt ended the open-
ing with his outstanding piece, "i am so
proud of you."
But that was only a slice of the open-
ing. And even in itself, the whole opening
was just a sliver of a week's worth of deli-
ciously diverse film. So if last night was
any indicator, the 47th AAFF is going to
be magnificent.
Like the slogan goes, "Welcome to the
new world of independent cinema." A
grand welcome indeed.

ers have been released to O

dissatisfaction with work Wednesdays
has proven to be univer- at 8:30 p.m.
sally relatable. Mirroring ABC
these plotlines, ABC's
new sitcom "Better off
Ted" tries to provide another Window into
the working world.
"Better off Ted" is an office-centered
satire revolving around Ted (relative
newcomer Jay Harrington), the head of
research and development at a monolithic
corporation named Viridian Dynamics.
The company, headed by ambitious boss
Veronica (Portia de Rossi, "Arrested Devel-
opment") works on outlandish projects like
weaponized pumpkins and intentionally
uncomfortable office chairs to increase
productivity. The company then attempts
to pawn off these odd items on unsuspect-
ing investors.
"Ted" feels like ABC's attempt to pro-
duce a critically acclaimed comedy in the

style of "Arrested Development" or "The
Office," and the show's stylistic choices
make it feel more than a little tired. The
wittily blas6 voiceover, the lack of a laugh
track, the roaming camera - all these
elements have been done better by other
shows. "Ted" even goes so far as to hire
"Arrested Development" alum de Rossi to
portray a character noticeably similar to
the ditzy Lindsay Bluth. The muted color
palette and intro and exit music's cloying-
ly sweet piano tinkling right before and
after commercial breaks are overly ironic
nods to the 1950s work culture that "Ted"
attempts to ape. All of this window dress-
ing comes off as extremely forced.
The program also suffers from its chop-
py storyline. Several plot elements are
introduced for a brief period of time - for
instance, Viridian Dynamics's decision to
cryogenically freeze research scientist Phil
(Jonathan Slavin, "Race to Witch Moun-
tain) for a year, or the burgeoning romance
between Phil and disgruntled office drone
Linda (Andrea Anders, "Joey") - but are
left unresolved at the end of the episode.
While pilot episodes tend to be less cohesive
than regular episodes, the complete lack of
conclusion left an unacceptably large num-
ber of loose ends. The script feels disjointed
and could benefit from a more focused sense
of humor.
"Ted" is not hopeless, though. Its strong

cast - especially supporting members sci-
entists Lem (Malcolm Barrett, "My Best
Friend's Girl") and Phil - adds some spice
to the lackluster writing. Harrington, as
the titular character, manages to be both
convincing as a high-powered businessman
and down-to-earth enough to sympathize
with. And Portia de Rossi, despite the com-
monalities between this role and her pre-
vious sitcom work, is excellent as always,
providing the funniest performance among
the group. One exception is Ted's daughter
Another 'office'
wannabe.
Rose (relative newcomer Isabella Acres),
who is unnaturally precocious and holds a
more serious tenor than the deadpan humor
shared by rest of the cast.
While nontraditional sitcoms normally
struggle to find an audience, the position
of "Ted" on a major network's primetime
lineup may help it last longer than its com-
petitors. While the show suffers from plot
mishaps and forcedstylistic choices,if"Ted"
is given enough time to find its footing, its
solid premise and strong cast may solidify
its place in the modern sitcom world.

Power Down to

MAX COLLINS/Daily
Ann Arbor resident Ken Anbender goes through artwork at the Fourteenth Annual Exhibition of Art by Michigan Prisoners held at the Duderstadt Center Gallery. The
show will be running until April 8 and is meant to bring attention to the abilities of those in the state's prisons. It highlights more than 300 works of art by over 200 artists.

to Suslow. She said professors gear
their curricula to the issues facing
the business world today, which
includes ethical decisions in the
workplace.
Mario Macis, an assistant pro-
fessor in Business, Economics and
Public Policy, took the current
economic state into account in the
creation of his curriculum this
semester.
"Certainly the fact that we are
in an economic downturn affected
my choice of topics," Macis said.
Macis is currently teaching a cur-
riculum based on CEO incentives
and responsible actions in the

workplace.
Decisions made by CEOs in
major corporations, like the
bonuses doled out by executives
at American International Group,
have been cited as a major factor
in the need for government aid as
of late.
Joel Slemrod, an Economics and
Business School professor, said he
often pulls his curriculum from
current events. The economic
difficulties occurring worldwide
have allowed for more opportuni-
ties to discuss recent events in his
classroom, he said.
"We always try to relate the
curriculum with what's going on

now," he said. "The day-to-day
events and the state of the econo-
my are even more prevalent than
they used to be."
Business junior Amanda
Vogelsang, said she sees no signifi-4
cant change in the teaching styles
in her classes, but added that her
instructors have started gear-
ing classroom discussions toward
ethical business decisions in the
future.
"I don't really notice any large
change in the classroom, although
many of my professors have
emphasized the importance of
responsible business practices,"
she said.

In Power Down,
colleges compete
to sign up the most
power savers
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
If all students and faculty at the
University switched their comput-
ers to power-saving modes, they
could conserve as much energy
as removing 4,500 cars from the
road. And this month as part of
the Power Down for the Planet
competition, University officials
are trying to get the campus to do
just that.
The competition, which the
University entered last Mon-
day, pits several colleges against
each other to see which one can
reduce its carbon emissions the
most by setting personal comput-
ers to energy-saving modes. The
U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's Energy Star program
and the Climate Savers Comput-
ing Initiative are sponsoring the
contest, which runs until April
17.
Bill Wrobleski, director of
Technical Infrastructure Opera-
tions for the University's Admin-
istrative Information Services,
said the program's purpose is to
change the energy consumption
habits of students and faculty at
the University.
"By individuals committing
we're hoping to make some sort
of a widespread impact and also
to educate everybody about the
potential positive effects they can
have," Wrobleski said.
To participate in the com-
petition, students, staff and
faculty must go to www.power-
downfortheplanet.org and pledge
to use the power-saving settings
on their computers. The univer-
sity with the highest percentage
of pledges will win.
By pledging, computer users
agree to set their computers on,
sleep mode when not in use and
turn them off at night.
A student steering committee
of about eight members has been
working to promote environ-
mentally friendly computing and
encourage students to participate
in the competition.
LSA freshman Anne Laverty, a
member of the steering commit-

tee, said she joined the committee
to push students toward taking
small steps to better the environ-
ment.
Laverty said switching com-
puters to a power-saving mode is
"a simple thing everyone can do
that will really just pay off in the
long run."
Power Down for the Planet will
sponsor UMix in the Union April
17. Members from the steering
committee are planning activities
like relay races, which end in par-
ticipants turning off computers
and taking trivia quizzes about
green computing facts.
Since the event will be held on
the last night of the campaign, the
steering committee will collect
the final pledges from students
attending UMix.
Wrobleski said if a large per-
centage of the 80,000 computers
located on campus were regis-
tered in the campaign, the Uni-
versity could "make a big dent in
the power usage," while also sav-
ing some green.
"If we can affect as many stu-
dents as we think, we can save
more than 1.6 billion kilowatt
hours of energy," he said. "That's
$150 million. More importantly,
that's one million tons of reduc-
tion in carbon emissions."
While reducing energy con-
sumption will save the University
money, Wrobleski said cutting
down on energy costs is not the
goal of the campaign.
"What we're doing here is we're
trying to change the behavior
of individuals and departments
across the University," he said.
The competition also involves
a video-making contest in which
students can film a story about
their green computing prac-
tices. The videos will be posted
on YouTube, and students with
winning films will receive priz-
es like laptops, software, cash
and bicycles.
This year's contest is the first
with competitors from universi-
ties like Ohio State, Penn State
and Purdue competing. Wrobleski
saidhehopes itbecomes an annual
event with more universities par-
ticipating each year to cut down
energy consumption throughout
the United States.
"Thisisoneofthosecaseswhere
we thought either we can just try
to tackle this in Ann Arbor, or we
could try to tackle this across the
country," he said.

"Amidst all of our other demands,

Council is hoping to receive fund-

lic housing. This recent backing
from the stimulus package will
only go to non-public low-income
housing.
However, Greden believes that
some of the county's grant will
benefit the city.
"I believe that some of the
money can be used by the city to
conduct a capital needs assess-
ment of our public housing facili-
ties," Greden said.
Capital needs assessments
enable city officials to learn about
the current status of public low-

reduce the burden on hospitals of

Usually, hospitals receive two
forms of compensation for provid-

The first is through tax breaks.

most hospitals are, pay lower taxes.

MSA would not be run as it has
traditionally been in the past, but
would instead cater directly to
students' needs.
"The upcoming year will not be
business as usual for MSA," Mah-
anti said. "(Rorro) and I have a
very clear vision for what we want
to do."
"I was pleased to support money
for weatherization in the stimu-
lus package, as well as the energy
packages Congress has passed in
recent years," he said. "I have long
supported these funds as a way
to help people make their homes
more energy efficient and thus
more cost effective. Moreover,
weatherization is a key piece of the
climate change puzzle."
Nationally the weatherization
program has historically received
$200 million. The 2009 stimulus
package has added an extra $5
billion.
"As we move forward," Dingell
wrote, "I will continue to express
my strong support for these pro-

However, there is a gap between

On the ice, he's ferocious. With a 6-foot-i, 200-pound frame, he's a dominant physical presence on the blueline, a play-
er who loves to deliver crowd-pleasing hits on opponents. His intensity often sends him to the penalty box at least
once a game.

what they're interested in and puts a smile on their faces. He grabs clipboards to organize volunteers and steers teammates, who *

Meet the two sides of sophomore defenseman Tristin Llewellyn.
By Nicole Auerbach U Daily Sports Editor

THE ENFORCER

THF NICF C,1Y

ZACHARY MEISNER
Sophomore Tristin Llewellyn delivers a vicious hit. Llewellyn has spent an hour and a half in the penalty box this season.

Beyond delivering hits that echo
off the walls of Yost Ice Arena,
Llewellyn is also known for his
penalty minutes.
Against Nebraska-Omaha on
Feb. 13-14, Llewellyn was a con-
stant fixture in the penalty box. He
accumulated 18 penalty minutes on
the weekend, including a 10-min-
ute misconduct.
The Wolverines are the nation's
third-most penalized team, and
Llewellyn leads them with 90 min-
utes in the box - the next-highest
amount on the team is 20 minutes
fewer.
Some of Llewellyn's minutes
came from lazy penalties in the
beginning of the season, Michigan
assistant coach Billy Powers said.
But now, Llewellyn limits inop-
portune penalties and those caused
simply by poor footwork.
"He's not taking penalties
where he's put himself in a vulner-
able position and his only reaction
would be to take a penalty," Powers
said. "He's playing better position-
ally, which is allowing him to find
those strong, solid hits when you

don't have to take penalties."
Llewellyn struggled with his
confidence and his ability to keep
up with the faster pace of colle-
giate competition during his fresh-
man year. After an offseason spent
focusing on agility and skating
techniques, Llewellyn has shown
slow and steady on-ice maturation
- as well as increasing self-confi-
dence - throughout this season.
"He was recruited as a guy that
was very trustworthy, a defensive
defenseman who brought that
physical element to the table," Pow-
ers said. "Now that he's adapted
better to the pace, and he's a lot
more confident in the speed of the
game, now you're starting to see
the physical Tristin come out a
little more.
"A year ago, where he had to go
looking for hits - this year, they're
coming to him a little bit better.
He's reading plays better."
Llewellyn's improved skating
and positioning have played impor-
tant roles in his strong sophomore
season. He's improved his plus-
minus rating by two points (cur-

rently plus-11), tallied 24 blocked
shots on the year and has allowed
just three even-strength goals since
January.
Llewellyn isn't the kind of guy
who hesitates to stick up for a
teammate or avoid a fight, either,
a habit that has led to some time
in the penalty box. But that tough
attitude helps make him a more
menacing physical presence on the
blueline.
"Hockeyis business,"Llewellyn's
father, David, said. "He doesn't like
people messing with his family,
which would be his team. That's
probably why he tries to stickup for
his teammates.
"He plays a very aggressive style
of hockey. Part of that probably
comes from when he was younger
playing Juniors, he had to do that to
stay alive."
Underneath the jersey and hock-
ey pads, though, Llewellyn is seem-
ingly a different person. When he's
not with his "family," he's often at
the hospital visiting sick children,
trying to put them at ease with
their surroundings.

(Left to Right) Alyssa, Sophomore Tristin Llewellyn, senior Travis Turnbull and freshman Luke Glendening at C.S. Moti's.

Llewellyn quickly realized
Alyssa was shy. After a few min-
utes in her hospital room two
weeks ago, he noticed that the
thin, blonde nine-year-old had
clammed up since he entered the
room, seemingly intimidated by a
new visitor's presence.
He quickly crossed the room to
stand next to Alyssa's bed.
"What's the name of your dog?"
he asked softly, pointing at the
giant stuffed animal on her lap.
His question immediately
engaged Alyssa, and after a few
minutes of conversation between
the two, she was grinning ear-to-
ear.
"There are athletes that go in
there and instantly know what
to say and make not only the kids
but the families more comfortable
that they're here," said Ed Boul-
lion, volunteer supervisor for the
"From the Heart" program.
"Tristin's one of them. We have
those naturals that come up here

and are doing it because they want
to do it. They get as much out of it
as the families. He'll always call
me or ask me questions to follow
up on what's going on."
Llewellyn is one of the most
common visitors on Thursday
nights, the time designated for
Michigan student-athletes in
"From the Heart," a program that
brings athletes to the hospital to
cheer up sick children.
Llewellyn began making regu-
lar hospital visits six years ago.
But the first patient he visited hit
closer to home than the others.
In 2003, while playing for the
Honeybaked hockey program
with current Michigan teammates
Aaron Palushaj and Matt Rust,
Llewellyn fired a slap shot that
flew into the stands during one
game. The puck hit Llewellyn's
younger brother, Darby, in the
head, fracturing his skull and
forcing him to spend nearly half a
week at C.S. Mott's. Llewellynvis-
the locker room grinning.
"(Llewellyn) loves to do things
like that," David said. "If he
believes he can put a smile on a
kid's face, he'll do it."
It was a stark contrast from a
half hour earlier when Llewellyn
was skating hard and fighting for
pucks during the game against
Western Michigan.
But even after watching him
slam players into boards and spend
time in the penalty box, those who
spend time around Llewellyn
aren't at all shocked by his off-ice
persona.
"No, it doesn't surprise me,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said. "He's an aggressive player but
he's a good person, a good kid. He's
got a big heart. I think he's another
humble kid. He didn't have every-
thing handed to him. He's worked
his way up. I think he'd be a good
example of what we'd expect from
all our players."
Powers reiterated Berenson's
point with an explanation of

ited his brother each day, and he
tried hard to convince the nurses
to let him bring in a Nintendo for
Darby to play with - to no avail.
"He treated me a lot nicer than
when he's just a normal brother,"
said Darby, now 12.
Spending three days in the
hospital gave Llewellyn a sense
of familiarity, and now he directs
other athletes around floors to
different rooms with little diffi-
culty. His attractionto C.S. Mott's
began with the personal connec-
tion he felt during Darby's recov-
ery.
But the constant trips to the
hospital aren't the first thing that
pops into his mind when he thinks
of the accident.
"It was even more annoy-
ing, because he was six, so I was
13," Llewellyn said. "You always
wrestle with your brother, right?
For six months, no contact. He
was sitting there poking every
button Ihad."

CTH E N TE RSECTIONSThe Wolverines' final game of
the season at Yost Ice Arena on
Marchl14 was special for more than
just the players.
Sitting in wheelchairs behind the
glass near the Michigan bench, two
teenage boys enjoyed the hockey
game, a special vacation from the
hospital.
Derek and Kyle are two patients
at C.S. Mott's whom Llewellyn has
been visiting frequently since Jan.
19.
"He's a nice guy, really person-
able," Derek said, adding that he
enjoyed watching the game and
meeting the players.
Llewellyn, senior Travis Turn-
bull, freshman Robbie Czarnik and
freshman Luke Glendening, who
have also met the boys at the hospi-
tal, spoke excitedly of the two boys'
visit in the week leading up to the
game. They said they couldn't wait
to give them a tour of their locker
room after the contest.

Sophomore Tristin Llewellyn showed coaches his softer side during his recruitment by helping out with his little brother's team. win, Llewellyn and the boys all left

Llewellyn's recruiting.
Because Llewellyn was the first
commitment in hisclass and lives in
Ann Arbor, Powers and the rest of
the coaching staff got to know him
better than most recruits. And one
of Llewellyn's biggest selling points
was his relationship with Darby.
Llewellyn often helped out at
his brother's hockey practices
- a trend that still continues.
Llewellyn has also coached hockey
camps that his younger brother
has attended.
"We knew that he got on the ice
and helped that team at practice,"
Powers said. "When you see an
older kid taking his younger broth-
er under his wing and stuff, things
like that really stick out. They real-
ly show character and show that
he's really got a good heart.
"You don't find a lot of teenage
kids spending time with a 10-year-
old. ... The fact that he's willing to
give his time (now) to those in need
and be a role model, well, that's not
a surprise."

Michigan's baserunning blunders halt comeback in embarrassing upset defeat

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan baseball coach Rich
Maloney is a little too good at fore-
shadowing.
"In the great game of baseball,
anyone can win any game," Malo-
ney said before yesterday's game.
He was right.
A week after the Wolverines
beat Eastern Michigan in Ypsilanti,
Michigan suffered a disappointing
3-1 loss to the Eagles at Ray Fisher
Stadium yesterday.

"I think we just assumed we were
gonna win the game," Maloney said.
Again, he was right.
Junior first baseman Mike Dufek
was one of
the play- EASTERN MICH. 3
ers dem- MICHIGAN 1
onstrating
that overconfidence. After Michi-
gan beat Indiana University-Pur-
due University Fort Wayne 9-2 on
Sunday, Dufek was blunt about his
teammates' expectations.
"We know that we are supposed
to win," he said. "It's only a matter

of us focusing and playing well."
Two days later, Maloney sensed
that overconfidence in his team. He
saw an obvious lack of energy com-
ing into yesterday's game.
"I even talked to the team before
the game," Maloney said. "I said,
'Let's understand that anyone can
knock you off.' Maybe this will be a
lesson learned for later days."
The sluggish Wolverines fell
behind in the fourth inning when
Eastern Michigan sophomore Matt
Skirving hit a two-run home run
over the right field wall.

And in uncharacteristic fashion,
Michigan couldn't respond to an
early deficit. Another run in the
sixth inning extended the Eagles'
lead to three.
In the bottom of the seventh
inning, the Wolverines cut the defi-
cit to two with senior Kevin Cislo's
RBI groundout which sent catcher
Tim Kalczynski home.
Michigan threatened in the
eighth, advancing runners to first
and second with a single and a walk,
but the Eagles got out of the inning
by picking Kalczynski off first base.

And again, during the ninth, the
Eagles picked off redshirt junior
Nick Urban at first, thwarting hopes
of a Michigan final-inning rally.
"We obviously killed ourselves,"
Cislo said. "We had a good week-
end (against IPFW), and we came
in with our heads high and got
knocked down right away."
Michigan's limited offensive
production didn't help its lethar-
gic early-inning play. The Wolver-
ines have scored one run or fewer
three times this season, and all
three games were losses. Despite

10 hits in yesterday's game, Michi-
gan couldn't figure out how to move
runners around the bags.
With the Wolverines opening
conference play Friday at Iowa,
Maloney knows his team can't keep
stranding runners if it hopes to be
a legitimate contender for the Big
Ten Championship. Not overlook-
ing opponents is key, too.
"At some point, you have to have
that fight inside yourself," Malo-
ney said. "They've got to make the
plays, they've got to get the hits,
and they've got to get the pitches."

Why, then, such a deplorable

to her but to myself
A mother's protective nature
always pulls through. She sat in
silence, tears rolling down her
made-up face. All she said was,
"Why didn't you tell me?" in heart-
wrenchingconfusion, over and over
again. Then she wanted to know
how, where, why. She partook in my
own epic disbelief. She wasn't judg-
mental; she simply had no frame
of reference for what I was going
through. I'd finally broken the
thick, critical exterior and brought
to her something to identify with, if
only just barely.
Apparently, that was all that
I needed. I needed to explain to
my mother, someone who I know
would unconditionally love and
care for me, even if she would never
be able to comprehend the magni-
tude of my situation. Since then, I
have been able to re-think the past
year and a half of my college experi-
ence. Sometimes, all one needs is to
cry in her mother's arms.
As my perspective changed, hers
did as well. Lately,she's beenhound-
ing me about getting back on birth

She has opened her mind once again

prehend what had happened to me.
What I want is to encourage women
on campus to have integrity, under-
standing and the capability for rea-
son that my mother didn't have and
that plenty of other women certain-
ly don't have. This isn't something
that occurs because of throw-
ing yourself at someone and then

just happens, without a single cause
and certainly no solution.
Compassion is absolutely neces-
sary, and when I overhear people on
campus talking about "some slut,"
I feel sick. I may very well.be that
"slut," that "whore," that wicked
"she-demon" flaunting her past to

My one piece of advice for girls
facing what I have: tell your mother.
Just tell her. Regardless of how you
think that she will react, don't har-
bor that pain inside any longer than
you have to. Tell her without expec-
tations built up in defense. Regard-
less of her reaction to your story,
you need to let it out to the woman
who understands you the most. Her
reaction may surprise you - and
trust me, it feels so much better

VIDEO OF
THE WEEK
More madness
For many people, March is a time
when most everything else is sub-
ordinated to college basketball. You
spend your days glued to the televi-
sion, bracket in hand, waiting for the
scores to roll in. And that's with only
64 teams in the tournament.
In this video, brought to you by
The Onion, the NCAA has appar-
ently decided to increase the number
of teams in March Madness to 4,096.
But don't panic. College basketball
analysts Tim and Joe are going to
distinguish the "contenders from the
pretenders" when they debate the
newly-expanded tournament in "The
Stream Room."
Was it a good idea to enlarge the
tournament? Definitely, Joe says,
because too many teams were unjust-
ly excluded in years past. Now, the
tournament will include teams from
Divisions II and III, community
colleges, online colleges and trade,
technical and devotional schools,
Regrettably, however, Oxnard Cali-
fornia's Advanced Truck Driving
School was left out this year because
its coach didn't register the team in
time for the tournament.
This revamped tournament will
now be called June Madness. People
will be able to watch 500 games a day
and, if they so choose, 24 games at
once. It's really for the fans, Joe says.
Start filling out those brackets. It
could take a while.

THEME PARTY SUGGESTION
Spring Awakening - After a seemingly intermi-
nable winter, it's finally warming up outside, which
means it's time to reunite with the friends you
haven't seen since November. To do this, throw a
party in the Arb on a sunny afternoon. Bring plenty
of alcohol, blankets and, if you must, a Frisbee. Let
the sun warm the outside of your body while the
alcohol warms the inside. Bring a jacket, though.
It'll probably be snowing again when you leave.
Throwing this party? Let us know. TheStotement@umich.edu

STUDY OF THE WEEK
Moderate drinking in social settings can be healthy
Moderate levels of alcohol consumed in social settings can reduce
ratesofheartdisease andstroke, accordingtoastudyrecentlypublished
in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.
For the study, the researchers looked at the drinking habits, social
networks and cardiovascular health of 19,356 Japanese men aged 40
to 60. Drinking patterns were divided into seven categories, includ-
ing "never," "past" and "occasional." For those who drank more
often, the researchers charted how many grams of alcohol they con-
sumed per week.
After nine years or more of observing the study participants, the
researchers discovered 629 strokes and 207 coronary heart diseases.
Those who drank more heavily, defined as 300 grams of alcohol per
week or more, increased their risk of stroke. But those who drank mod-
erately or lightly in social settings with friends actually reduced their
chances of contracting stroke and heart disease.

RANKINGTHE R/
THE KEY TO INTERPRETING COLLEGE RANKINGS IS UNDERSTANDING THE METHODOLOGY BEHIND THEM. WHICH OF

'NKINGS
THESE WILDLY DIFFERING SYSTEMS ARE WORTHWHILE?

BY STEPHEN OSTROWSKI
DAILY STAFF WRITER
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN calls itself
home of the leaders and best, And while the catch-
phrase might smack of arrogance, there is plenty
of support that this school does lead the pack and
is one of the best - application rates, research
grants, alumni base apd college rankings.
The U.S. News and World Report lists the Uni-
versity as the 26th-best institution of higher educa-
tion in the country, wedged comfortably between
the University of California at Los Angeles and the
University of Southern California, respectively.
Forbes Magazine, meanwhile, listed the Univer-
sity at161st, right between Lake Forest College and
Wisconsin Lutheran College.
In the world of college rankings, neck-breaking
double takes abound. But it's the nature of the
business that discrepancies exist - why would
Forbes begin ranking schools if its list was going to
match up almost exactly with U.S. News, the lead-
ing rankings publication? The flip side to that, of
course, is how could a dozen different publications
differentiate their rankingsysternsenough to make
printing them worthwhile? The trick is widely vary-
ing methodologies so that the same qualities that
got a university in one publication's top 20 barely
warrant a ranking above 200 to another publica-
tion.
College rankings might not be what they appear
to be, but they can't be written off altogether. At
least prospective students don't think so. Accord-
ing to Michigan Cooperative Institutional Research
data, 41.6 percent of students entering the Uni-
versity in Fall 2008 said that rankings were "very
impnrtant" in decidincEwhere tn attend. nmnared

3.YALE
Report 26. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
Undoubtedly the recognized authority on college rankings, the U.S. News list
can be likened to the hyper-masculine, turbo-Neanderthal fourth-grader that dom-
inates the blacktop and crushes the meek competition. But name recognition does
not necessarily translate into respect.
The.Education Conservancy, an education reform organization, has an open letter
on its website signed by several university presidents that criticizes the U.S. News
rankings as "misleading" and says that its system tends to "overlook the importance
of a student in making education happen and overweight the importance of a uni-
versity's prestige in that process."
As detailed on its website (college.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com), U.S. news
obtains its rankings by averaging together differently weighted components. First
is peer assessment, weighed at 25 percent, for which university administrators rate
schools' academic programs on a 1-5 scale. Second is retention rate, weighed at 20
percent, which measures how many students graduate in six years or less and how
many freshmen return the next year. Another 20 percent is faculty resources, con-
sisting of class size, faculty pay, the highest college degrees obtained by professors,
student-faculty ratio and percentage of fulltime faculty.
Then, there is student selectivity (measured by standardized test scores),
accounting for 15 percent. The next 10 percent is financial resources or "average
spending per student on instruction, research, student services, and related educa-
tion expenditures."

Playing apparent foil to the U.S. News is Forbes Magazine, whose rankings are
based on "the quality of education (universities) provide and how much their stu-
dents achieve."
. Rankings are determined in conjunction with the Center for College Afford-
ability and Productivity and include five components. First, weighed at 25 percent,
is the number of alumni in the yearly "Marquis Who's Who in America" list, a
directory of influential people in the nation. A description of the rankings system's
methodology on Forbescom said this measurement was selected over the peer
assessment method used by U.S. News and student opinion prioritized heavily in
Princeton'Review. The Forbes list focuses on alumni achievement more directly
than any other rankings.
Accounting for another 25 percent is student evaluation of professors, compiled
from entries on RateMyProfessor.com. Anyone who's posted a too-harsh review
on the website out of temporary anger might see how this measurement could be
imperfect. But Forbes attests that the method is sound, as the website serves as
a sort of consumer review forum free from the control of university administra-
tors.
Rounding out the list's components are four-year graduation rate (16.66percent),
average student debt (16.66 percent), and number of awards won by students and
faculty. Among the awards considered are the Rhodes Scholarship and-Fulbright
grants for students and the Nobel Prize and Guggenheim Fellowship for faculty.

Rankings 18. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
Harvard is ranked 28th. Enough said?
On its website,The Washington Monthly prefaces its rankings with the follow-
ing: "Welcome to The Washington Monthly College Rankings. Unlike other college
guides, such as the U.S. News and World Report, this guide asks not what colleges
can do for you, but what colleges are doing for their country." Kennedy allusions
aside, The Washington Monthly aims to create rankings of colleges based on one
question: "Are they doing well by doing good?"
To actually measure universities' devotion to the adage "do good by doing good,"
The Washington Monthly determines its rankings by three components. The first
is a school's capability to perform as an "engine of social mobility"based on the pro-
jected graduation rate of Pell students (grants received by lower-income students).
Factored in next is research in the humanities and sciences, determined by
money spent on projects, the number of PhDs awarded in Science and Engineering
and the number of alums who go on to obtain PhDs.
Finally, The Washington Monthly weighs service to the community, measured
by percentage of students in ROTC, alums in the Peace Corps and grants given to
community service projeets. Michigan is one of six institutions to send over 2,000
volhnteers to the Peace Corps, according to the Peace Corps website.
Any rankings system that casts Harvard outside the top 10 is pretty anomalous
- but keeping in mind President Kennedy's designation of the Peace Corps on the
steps of -the Michigan Union, any rankings system that gives priority to student
service seems pretty noble as well.

Perhaps the most novel rankings system belongs to the Global Language
Monitor, a linguistics organization ranking schools based on, according to lan-
guagemonitor.com, a school's "appearance on the Internet, throughout the blo-
gosphere, as well as global print and electronic media."
This system seeks to measure prominence of a school's "brand name" by
counting how many times its name is mentioned online as well as in print and
electronic media. GLM attains this information with its "Trendtopper analysis"
system; which the company has used to track trends in word usage over the last
five years.
GLM President Paul J.J. Payack said on the website that the students who go
farthest are those who carry the best name recognition.
"Prospective students, alumni, employers, and the world at large believe that
students who are graduated from such institutions will carry on the all the hall-
marks of that particular school," Payack said. "Our TrendTopper analysis is a
way of seeing the schools through the eyes of the world at large."
That is good news for Michigan students: GLM has the University ranked
third, behind only Harvard and Columbia.
GLM's ranking system is certainly an innovative idea, given the increasingly
digital, Twitter addicted world. But should-GLM's rankings grow in.clout, uni-
versities might try to inflate their rank with obnoxious viral videos. It'll be a sad
day when a university tries to garner attention via "I'm On a Boat"-type YouTube
stardom.
