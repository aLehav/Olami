Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton takes pictures with churchgoers after speaking at the House of Prayer Missionary Baptist Church in Flint on Sunday. 

Presidential hopeful 

discusses water 

crisis

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Democratic presidential can-

didate Hillary Clinton visited 
Flint on Sunday to attend a com-
munity meeting with Flint Mayor 

Karen Weaver. During remarks 
at the meeting, Clinton discussed 
her support for the Flint commu-
nity amid the city’s water crisis 
and federal states of emergency.

The Flint water crisis began 

in April 2014 when the city 
switched from Detroit city water 
to Flint River water. In the weeks 
and months following the switch, 
citizens began reporting adverse 
health effects, but the city didb’t 
return to Detroit water until Oct. 

2015.

Clinton’s visit follows her 

mention of the Flint water cri-
sis in the last two Democratic 
debates and on the campaign 
trail. Additionally, the visit came 
just two days before the New 
Hampshire primary, where Clin-
ton trails Bernie Sanders by 20 
points, according to a NBC/Wall 
Street Journal poll.

Clinton’s 
appearance 
was 

preceded by a sermon by Pastor 

Kenneth L. Stewart in the House 
of Prayer Missionary Baptist 
Church where the meeting was 
held, in which he encouraged 
patrons to wait for God’s assis-
tance in the crisis.

Clinton discussed the need 

for both immediate action in the 
form of infrastructure improve-
ments and long-term monitoring 
and care for the affected chil-
dren. Lead exposure in young 

Gathering 

initially created in 
response to Return 
of Kings meet-up

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Writer

Nearly 100 protesters gath-

ered in the Diag Saturday night 
to attend a rally for women’s 
rights awareness in response 
to a proposed meet-up of self-
proclaimed men’s rights group 
Return of Kings in downtown 
Ann Arbor. The protest carried 
on despite the event’s cancella-
tion late last week.

LSA 
sophomore 
Susanna 

Wang created the rally’s Face-
book event protesting ROK’s 
meet-ups, which turned into 
a community effort to address 
women’s 
rights 
and 
issues 

including reproductive health, 
sexism on campus and discrimi-
nation against sexuality. Both 
city organizers and students 
said their aim was to frame the 

rally positively — as a show of 
feminism and solidarity — rath-
er than an angry reaction to the 
proposed meet-up. One of the 
event’s organizers, Lauren Ash-
ley, a Hazel Park resident, said 
the interest the event garnered 
on Facebook moved her to alter 
its message.

“When we found out over 600 

people were interested in com-
ing … we wanted to turn this 
into something good and focus 
on the positive,” Ashley said. 
“Instead of focusing all of our 
energy and resources on these 
awful men, we wanted to cel-
ebrate women instead.”

ROK gained national atten-

tion on social media last week 
after 
announcing 
“interna-

tional tribal meetups” for mem-
bers. The group, led by founder 
Roosh Valizadeh, is infamous 
for advocating agendas such 
as the legalization of rape on 
private property and gender-
based subjugation. The Uni-
versity’s Department of Public 
Safety and Security and the Ann 
Arbor Police Department said 

Agency says sexually 
active women not 
on birth control 

should avoid alcohol

By KATIE PENROD

Daily News Editor

On Tuesday, the Center for 

Disease Control released a 
statement recommending that 
sexually active women who 
are not on birth control should 
refrain from drinking alcohol. 
Since the statement’s release, 
the CDC has received harsh 
backlash from women citing the 
recommendation as antiquated 
and extreme.

During pregnancy, if women 

consume alcohol, they are at 
risk of giving their newborns 
fetal alcohol syndrome. This 
syndrome 
can 
encompass 

symptoms such as learning dis-
abilities and heart defects.

Women’s 
Studies 
Prof. 

Joanne Motino Bailey, director 
of the Nurse Midwifery Ser-
vice at the University, said she 

thought that while there is some 
merit to the CDC’s recommen-
dation, the way it was released 
assumed a lot about sexually 
active women.

“I have no idea what their 

tactic is in this very broad, far-
reaching 
justification,” 
she 

said. “I think it would be totally 
appropriate for women who are 
planning a pregnancy to avoid 
alcohol; that makes complete 
sense. But this broad-arching 
idea, assuming women are hav-
ing sex with men, is making 
men’s responsibility not even 
considered.”

LSA 
senior 
Stephanie 

Mecham, director of circle 
engagement for Lean In at the 
University, echoed Bailey’s sen-
timents, saying that the CDC’s 
statement leaves out certain 
subsets of women and leads to 
questionable assumptions about 
who is sexually active and in 
what way.

“I think it’s really problemat-

ic because it definitely excludes 
a lot of people. It excludes a lot 
of people who identify as queer 
or lesbian and people who are

Over 50 from Flint, 

Dearborn and 

Ann Arbor discuss 
implementing change

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Members of the University 

community gathered at the Uni-
versity’s Flint campus Saturday 
morning for the inaugural Tri-
Campus Community Engagement 

Summit, where students from the 
Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint 
communities came together to 
explore issues including rights 
of campus workers, community 
organizing, body image and refu-
gee support.

The event, which drew roughly 

50 students, was centered around 
the theme of social justice and the 
University’s Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. symposium: #WhoWill-
BeNext. The day’s workshops and 
activities were entirely student-
run, a product of planning and 
preparation from a cross-campus 

committee of student leaders.

In her opening address to stu-

dents, Susan Borrego, chancellor 
of the University’s Flint campus, 
said though the meeting was 
held in Flint due to a scheduling 
conflict, the relocation was ulti-
mately a valuable opportunity for 
students to engage in community 
networking within the context of 
the city’s current water contami-
nation crisis.

“It couldn’t be a more impor-

tant moment in the life of this 
community,” Borrego said, add-

rent Business students, potential

Dyson’s talk covered a wide 

range — he jumped from sharing 
an anecdote about receiving a call 
from O.J. Simpson to discussing 
the significance of race in profes-
sional athletes’ reputations, drop-
ping names like Cam Newton 
and Serena Williams, to political 
responsibility in Flint, Michigan.

U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee 
introduces two pieces 

of legislation to 

provide aid to Flint

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D–Flint) 

has introduced two bills aimed 
toward helping the community 
of Flint and preventing similar 
health effects in the future.

The Flint water crisis began 

in April 2014 when the city 
switched from Detroit city water 
to Flint River water. The water 
from the Flint River had a much 
higher corrosive quality than the 
Detroit water which allowed lead 
from the pipes to contaminate 
the water. Following the switch, 
citizens began reporting adverse 
health effects, but the city didn’t 

switch back to Detroit water until 
October 2015.

State Sen. Jim Ananich (D–

Flint) said he thought it is pri-
marily the responsibility of the 
state to help the citizens of Flint, 
but any additional aid is appreci-
ated. The state legislature recent-
ly approved a nearly $28 million 
dollar request from Gov. Rick 
Snyder (R) to fund efforts in Flint.

“This is a state failure and the 

state needs to fix it, that is pretty 
widely acknowledged,” Ananich 
said. “But the support from the 
federal government and all across 
the country is really nice to see.”

Kildee’s “Families of Flint Act” 

is a comprehensive bill aimed at 
providing long-term funding for 
infrastructure improvements and 
developmental care for affected 
children.

In an interview Sunday, Kildee 

said fixing the damaged pipes in 
Flint is the first major component 
of the bill.

“One part is to pay for sig-

nificant improvements to Flint’s 
water system, so the damage that 
was done by the highly corrosive 
water will be a temporary prob-
lem, and Flint will have a water 
system it can count on for years,” 
he said.

Sharon 
Swindell, 
assistant 

professor of pediatrics at the 
University, said lead poisoning 
in children is one of the most 
salient health concerns from 
the crisis because it can lead to 
developmental issues.

“There is no safe level of lead 

in a person’s body,” Swindell 
said. “Children, who have a lot of 
brain growth and development 
in the first six years, are vulner-
able to cognitive and develop-
mental effects.”

Kildee said the more long-

term focus of the bill involves 
ensuring 
affected 
children 

receive the necessary support to 
overcome any issues in the years 
to come.

“A big part of what the bill 

would pay for is the educational, 
nutritional, behavioral needs of 
people who have been affected 
by lead poisoning, especially 
children,” Kildee said.

As part of the bill, the state 

would be required to match 
every dollar of federal funding 
with state funds. This year, the 
state has approximately $575 
million in lapse funds — leftover 
money at the end of the fiscal 
year. Snyder is currently draft-
ing a recommendation for how to 
appropriate these funds.

Kildee said due to the state’s 

budget surplus this year, he 
believes the matching mecha-
nism is feasible for the state.

“The state actually has the 

money right now,” he said. “This 
year they had a budget surplus. 
I think that is a perfectly good 
source of money for them. The 
state has no excuse for what they 
did to Flint and for not helping 
Flint because they have money.”

Students highlight 

perceived lack 
of institutional 
transparency

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

Students discussed non-inclu-

sive behaviors in the classroom 
and the University’s perceived 
lack of transparency in relation 
to issues of mental health at a 
forum on Friday.

During the discussion, facili-

tators and attendees suggested 
initiating a required training 
process for faculty and GSIs to 
combat the stigmatization of 
mental health issues and to cre-
ate more inclusive classroom 
environments for students with 
mental illnesses.

The LSA Undergraduate Edu-

cation Campus Climate Commit-
tee held the forum to address of 
mental health stigmas on cam-
pus and how those issues mani-
fest themselves in a classroom 

setting, according to facilitators 
Shamaila Ashraf and Toni Wang, 
both LSA juniors. The discus-
sion focused on possible changes 
that could go beyond the Univer-
sity’s established resources for 
students with mental illnesses 
like College And Psychological 
Services and Wolverine Support 
Network.

The Campus Climate Com-

mittee was formed in 2013, and 
this is the second of several such 
planned forums. Wang said the 
poor treatment of students suf-
fering from mental health issues 
in 
educational 
environments 

was the focus of the earlier dis-
cussion and continued to be sig-
nificant in this subsequent form 
because of its direct impact on 
daily life.

“There are definitely some 

professors or GSIs who may 
make it a more intimidating 
environment for people to reach 
out, but I think that even those 
who are more understanding of 
those issues aren’t being reached 
out to,” Wang said. “This is 
because students aren’t being 
told it is OK if you are struggling 

through mental health issues 
and we want you to be mentally 
well to thrive here and feel like 
you belong.”

She added that she believes 

the University lacks visibility 
when discussing mental health, 
which prevents students from 
utilizing resources the campus 
offers, also, contributing to the 
stigma professors and students 
associate with mental illness.

“There’s no transparency in 

terms of the resources and if 
people will listen to those stu-
dents,” she said. “I think that’s 
a huge issue, that openness, 
because there’s no conversation. 
People don’t talk about it even 
though there’s so many strug-
gling with it, because they feel 
like they would be shamed.”

Ashraf said these forums are 

key to sparking action in a school 
as large as LSA, which has many 
departments 
acting 
indepen-

dently.

“It has to be taken into account 

when you’re looking at how to 
gauge what is a problem,” she 
said. “In the psychology depart-

A national activist group 

called Ultraviolet sponsored 
a plane banner protesting 
Governor Rick Snyder’s (R) 
potential involvement in 
the Flint water crisis.

The banner read “SNY-

DER POISONED KIDS IN 
FLINT” and flew over the 
Crisler Center during the 
rivalry 
basketball 
game 

against Michigan State Uni-
versity.

“It is time that all Michi-

gan residents – Spartans 
and Wolverines alike – 
stand up and demand that 
Governor 
Snyder 
resign 

immediately,” 
Shaunna 

Thomas, 
co-founder 
of 

UltraViolet, said in a press 
release.

Ultraviolet intended for 

the banner to draw atten-
tion to their petition for 
Governor Snyder’s resig-
nation 
for 
mishandling 

Flint’s toxic water. Ultra-
violet is an online advo-
cacy group that advocates 
against sexism. The group 
has over 700,000 members, 
and almost 32,000 of those 
members have signed the 
petition for the Governor’s 
resignation.

After Flint’s emergency 

manager decided to change 
the city’s water supply 
to the Flint river in 2014, 
residents 
began 
voicing 

concerns over the discol-
oration and off taste of the 
water. 
Despite 
multiple 

reports proving there to 
be lead in the city’s water, 

Snyder only called a state 
of emergency in December 
2015, 18 months after the 
initial switch.

Thomas said Snyder was 

aware of the lead in Flint’s 
water for at least a year but 
neglected to take action, 
alleging that the governor 
sent bottled water to state 
employees last year, which 
they have used as evidence 
for his knowledge of the 
lead in Flint’s water.

The petition also empha-

sizes the poor and Black 
community of Flint the 
water crisis affected, as 
well 
as 
the 
permanent 

health damages to children 
and pregnant women.

Wednesday they were investigat-
ing ROK’s original plan to meet 
up, but did not release a statement 
after the cancellation.

AAPD Sergeant Patrick Magu-

ire said though the backlash 
against the meet-up took place 
primarily online, AAPD officers 
still needed to monitor real-life 
implications. 
Maguire 
stood 

outside Nickel’s Arcade, ROK’s 
proposed assembly point in Ann 
Arbor on Saturday night, but said 
aside from a few protesters inside 
the arcade, the space was fairly 
quiet throughout the night.

“We’re just keeping an eye on 

things tonight,” he said.

A majority of attendees at the 

rally were local community mem-
bers and activists. Groups used 
the rally to promote other wom-

en’s rights issues — many carried 
signs for Planned Parenthood and 
Students for Choice. Second-year 
law student Dana Ziegler, member 
of Law Students for Reproductive 
Justice, said it was important for 
her organization to stand united 
with those at the rally.

“We saw that the undergrads 

had organized this event, and saw 
it as a great opportunity to turn 
it around into an educational and 
positive event, ” she said. “It’s 
important not to just talk about 
this event as a reaction to this 
group, but as a reaction to the 
prevalent sexism in our society.”

Multiple protesters also spoke 

of lending their voices to the cause 
as individuals. Ann Arbor resident 
Chris Thomas said it was impor-
tant for him as a Black man to 
attend.

“Utilizing the support networks 

that are built between things like 
Black Lives Matter and the femi-

nist movement brings about a bet-
ter place for everyone,” he said. 
“As we all sort of gain rights, we 
gain a better world.”

The rally drew protesters from 

communities as far as Lansing and 
Detroit, many of whom spoke dur-
ing the rally’s slate of speakers or 
as part of an open-mic speakout-
style session. The Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center 
staffed a debriefing room in the 
Michigan League for the dura-
tion of the event, and organizers 
repeatedly referred to the rally as 
a “safe space.”

Though multiple speakers did 

touch on prevailing issues of vio-
lence against women, the occasion 
ultimately celebrated feminists’ 
rights and the women present at 
the event. 

“Tonight, our kings are in caves, 

it seems,” one attendee chanted 
from the crowd during a speaker. 
“We won.”

to sharing a few lyrics from classic 
hip-hop songs. The lecture, howev-
er, mainly focused on the relation-
ship between business and social 
movements and a legacy of leader-
ship, which was the theme of the 
conference.

The Detroit native had a lot to 

say about the importance of being 
authentic in business and social 
movements; he cited himself as an 
example.

“I’ve got to be who I am, talk like 

I do, cite some blues lyrics, some 
Shakespeare, some hip-hop, some 
great poetry, some Black preach-
ing, some country music — which I 
love very greatly — and that is who 
am and that is why I am comfort-
able doing what I do and express-
ing the full range of my identity as 
much as my gifts will allow me,” 
Dyson said.

Dyson also talked about the 

importance of knowing how to 
“code switch” as a person of color 
in the business world and shared 
with the audience advice he gave 
to his own son. Code switching 
refers to when a speaker alternates 
between two different forms of 
speech, which can mean either 
switching dialects or languages.

“When you’re working in busi-

ness you’ve got to be the most noble 
sellout you know how to be,” he 
said.

He emphasized that he didn’t 

want to overstate the importance of 
race, noting that people are diverse 
in many ways, but said individuals 
shouldn’t be afraid to be who they 
are, even in professional situations.

“There is something to be said 

for coming from a society where 
the experiences of our culture 
have been limited according to 
artificial barriers like race, class, 
sexual orientation and gender and 
the like,” Dyson said. “So at the 
end of the day it makes a differ-
ence, and yes, business does have 
a role to play in the distribution 
of justice and the application of 
it, both in a board room, both in 
the corporate culture, and in the 
broader society that those corpo-
rations or businesses or conglom-
erates or startups affect.”

Victor Olowu, a Chicago resi-

dent attending the conference, 
said he thought that Dyson was 
amazing, albeit unconventional, 
and he felt he took a lot away 
from the talk. Olowu was espe-
cially impacted by Dyson’s story 
of General Motors’ actions in the 
Flint water crisis, where the com-
pany switched from Flint River 
water back to Lake Huron water 
in Oct. 2014 due to fear of its cor-
rosion, much before the city itself 
changed its water supply a year 
later. The initial change to Flint 
river water occurred in April 2014. 

“Businesses should make their 

stance on ethical issues known, 
regardless of the financial con-
sequences,” Olowu said. “Com-
panies should think about the 
communities around them and 
how their actions affect them.”

The annual conference is host-

ed by the Black Business Students 
Association and is the longest-
running student-led conference on 
campus. Business senior Giancarlo 
Moise, a member of the BBSA, said 
he felt the conference was impor-
tant to students because they were 
able to get advice from individuals 
with a range of experiences.

“(The speakers) have met so 

many influential people through-
out their life — they had been 
shaped by so many different 
things, and we can experience 
that by listening to them,” he said.

Business 
senior 
Christian 

Abney, who is also a member of 
BBSA, said the student organiza-
tion and the conference have had 
a profound impact on his educa-
tional experience.

“Especially the MBA is much 

more than a classroom experi-
ence,” Abney said. “It’s the dif-
ferent people that you’re meeting, 
the different groups that you are 
involved in, the different cultures 
that you’re exposed to and bring-
ing that into business.”

Moise agreed.
“I thought it was powerful 

that many of our classmates who 
weren’t African American were 
there sitting next to us,” he said. 
“BBSA has had an impact outside 
of just students of color within the 
Ross community. When our dean, 
Alison Davis-Blake, talked about 
the Black Lives Matter vigil, that 
was powerful for all of us, and that 
was powerful because it wasn’t 
just the BBSA students that were 
there — everyone stood up in soli-
darity for that movement.”

Both students said they thought 

the talk was inspiring and made 
them more optimistic about find-
ing ethical companies to work for 
post-graduation.

“To a certain degree, busi-

ness needs to lead a lot of change, 
because business is given a plat-
form,” Abney said. “Especially 
for successful businesses — it’s 
just like anything else, if you are a 
celebrity, or a politician or an ath-
lete, you are given a platform and a 
means to reach people in order to 
create some type of change.”

infertile or unable to have chil-
dren,” she said. “In the phrasing 
of their recommendations they 
just said any young women who 
are having sex and not on birth 
control need to be worried about 
being pregnant, which obviously 
isn’t factual. It just marginalizes 
a lot of people who are already 
excluded from the mainstream.”

One of the concerns cited in the 

CDC’s recommendation was the 
number of unplanned pregnan-
cies in the United States, mean-
ing women may not be aware that 
they are pregnant and at risk of 
giving their newborns fetal alco-

hol syndrome. Bailey said about 50 
percent of pregnancies are unin-
tended, a fact the CDC empha-
sized as a reason for restricting 
alcohol use if women are not using 
a form of birth control.

Bailey said though avoiding 

alcohol makes sense for women 
planning a pregnancy, there is 
conflicting 
empirical 
support 

for the true effects of drinking 
on fetuses, and noted the CDC’s 
approach is severe.

“Fetal alcohol syndrome is a 

real thing,” she said. “As far as 
we know, fetal alcohol syndrome 
occurs in women who are drink-
ing very large amounts of alcohol, 
like a fifth a day. Even of those 
women who are chronic alcohol-
ics who drink that much, not all 

children that they give birth to 
while they’re consuming that 
alcohol are going to have fetal 
alcohol syndrome. We don’t really 
know what is different in each 
gestating embryo and fetus.”

She added that other countries 

have different approaches to alco-
hol during sexually active times 
for women as well as for preg-
nancy. This, she said, adds to the 
discrepancies surrounding the 
true risk associated with alcohol 
consumption.

“There’s never been data that 

people support across the board 
that says ‘this is a safe amount’ 
in the United States,” she said. 

children can lead to developmen-
tal issues and can cause behav-
ioral problems and affect future 
academic performance.

“This is no time for politics as 

usual,” she said. “Flint should be 
able to start making the repairs 
you need to have clean water as 
soon as possible. We need to do 
so much more to provide health 
care and educational support for 
Flint’s children.”

Clinton talked about lead 

poisoning as an issue affecting 
communities across the coun-
try, citing her work dealing with 
lead-based paint exposure dur-
ing her tenure as one of New 
York’s senators.

She said she would stand by 

the Flint community and fight to 
ensure they are taken care of.

“As a senator I fought for chil-

dren,” she said. “I will fight for 
you in Flint no matter how long 
it takes.”

Citing an amendment to a 

bipartisan energy bill proposed 
by Senator Gary Peters (D–
Mich.) and Debbie Stabenow (D–
Mich.) — which would provide 
$200 million in federal fund-
ing for Flint — Clinton said she 
supported legislation aimed at 
assisting the city.

U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Flint) 

also recently sponsored compre-
hensive legislation, which would 
provide $765 million in federal 
funding to Flint for both short-
term infrastructure repairs and 
long-term support for affected 
children. The bill additionally 
requires the state to match every 
dollar provided by the federal 
government with state funding.

In an interview Sunday Kildee 

said he thought Clinton’s sup-

port helps raise the issue to the 
national level it needs to get the 
proper response.

“I think her presence helps 

elevate this to the national 
issue it should be at,” he said. 
“A national issue is a legiti-
mate issue that Congress should 
take up. The moral outrage that 
people feel that she expresses 
doesn’t mean anything if it’s not 
translated to help for the people 
of Flint, and that’s the message 
that she helped deliver.”

Flint resident Laura Henry 

said she believes Clinton will 
help ensure Flint will receive the 
support it needs to get through 
the crisis.

“I think it was very nice of 

her to come,” she said. “It was 
an awesome experience. I think 
she is going to look out for us. She 
is going to do the best she can to 
make sure we get all of the help 
and resources we need.”

ment, students could be facing 
something there that students in 
the economics department aren’t. 
That’s just how LSA pans out.”

LSA junior Jacqueline Saplicki 

Lausell said she found the forum 
productive and was inspired by 
some of the discussions she had.

“It’s humbling to always see 

that people want to give back to 
their communities in ways that 
won’t only benefit themselves,” 
she said. “The question of inclu-
sivity is something that this cam-
pus has struggled with and what 
I found very impactful from this 
discussion is that we as students 
are looking for several ways to 
combat problems that have arisen 
in the general cookie-cutter mod-
els of education systems.”

LSA senior Jessica Feather said 

she felt motivated after the forum 
to become more involved in the 
campus community before she 
graduates.

“I’m really excited that I’m not 

the only one who sees issues on 
this campus, nor am I the only 
one who experiences them,” she 
said. “Of course, a lot of my expe-
riences aren’t the same as others’, 
but I like how we can express 
solidarity and really connect 
with each other in such a safe 
space and actually develop ideas 
for what can tangibly promote 
change on campus.”

Feather added that the forum 

made her feel more connected to 
the campus community.

“There is a community that 

I’ve missed out on but can also 
still connect to,” she said. “I’ve 
also come away with the under-
standing that my school does care 
about me and students do care 
about each other, which is really 
heartwarming and relieving in a 
way.” 

ing that she hopes students will 
consider not only the theme 
#WhoWillBeNext but also who 
will be now.

“Here we are today in the 

midst of one of the largest acts 
of injustice on a community 
for quite some time,” Borrego 
said. “It wouldn’t be completely 
accurate to say this is new.”

Outlining other instances of 

environmental injustice, such 
as contamination of water and 
improper waste disposal, she 
said then disproportionately 
affected low-income communi-
ties due to their lack of political 
capital.

She ultimately urged stu-

dents to collaborate with each 
other and consider ways in 
which they could positively and 
respectfully impact the Flint 
community. 

“The consciousness that we 

bring to this work always has 
to be ‘What’s our relationship 
to power in the community?’ 
— ‘what’s our relationship to 
power in our daily lives?’ ” 
Borrego said. “How do we not 
exploit a people but use our 
power and resources to make 
more space?” 

Following Borrego’s address, 

students 
attended 
various 

workshops, 
all 
promoting 

community engagement and 
networking, and focusing on a 
different campus issue.

At the workshop on workers’ 

rights, students from the Uni-
versity’s chapter of Fight for 
15, a student organization dedi-
cated to encouraging the Uni-
versity to raise minimum wage 
for its student and non-student 
workers to $15, gave a presen-
tation on their cross-campus 
work between the Ann Arbor 

and Dearborn campuses.

LSA junior Rebecca Wren, 

a member of Fight for 15, said 
she hopes the workshop will 
encourage students from the 
University’s other campuses to 
engage with the organization 
in the future. The organization 
is currently active on both the 
Ann Arbor and Dearborn cam-
puses.

“One of the most rewarding 

experiences of doing the cam-
paign is meeting the Dearborn 
students because I think there 
is a lot of isolation from the 
campuses in general,” Wren 
said, attributing the barrier 
between the Ann Arbor and 
Dearborn campuses to a lack 
of transportation. 

“If more things could bring 

the campuses together, I think 
that would be really great for 
students to see the differenc-
es in their campuses but also 
see the similarities we have 
together as students,” Wren 
added.

Teia McGahey, a junior in 

the College of Arts, Sciences 
and Letters at the University’s 
Dearborn campus, who is also 
involved in Fight for 15, echoed 
Wren’s optimism.

“I thought today’s conversa-

tion went really well. I think it 
just sort of reflects the whole 
conference — the power of 
bringing the three campuses 
together,” McGahey said. “A 
big part of why I’m here is 
student power, and knowing 
how much we can get done if 
we work together, and finally 
being able to bridge the gaps 
between Dearborn, Ann Arbor 
and Flint to really make big 
changes on our campuses and 
hopefully reflect the changes 
that students want to see for 
the future.”

Ideology of higher education

T

here’s a difference between 
being 
Black 
and 
being 

mixed.

Even 
when 

you’re 
mixed, 

people see your 
skin as a shade of 
brown, which is 
associated 
with 

being Black. It’s 
nearly impossible 
to make a distinc-
tion that you’re 
part white, and 
there’s 
nothing 

wrong with that. 
But even when 
people do know you’re mixed, the 
Black half can trump the white one 
in how often it is mentioned and used 
to explain stereotypes.

Barack Obama wasn’t the first 

Black president. He was the first 
mixed president. Yes, he was the 
first president of African-Ameri-
can descent (his father was from 
Kenya), but his mother is a white 
woman. He has had to deal with 
blatant racism all of his life.

As for me, I am fortunate to not 

have dealt with the systematic rac-
ism that many Black and mixed 
people have faced in the past and 
face in the present. I haven’t been 
kept out of places because of my 
race and haven’t faced hate speech 
or lived in fear every day like some 
have and still do. But the subtle rac-
ism and racist jokes that have been 
directed toward me have made me 
realize that my racial identity has 
been defined by others in terms of 
my Black half or my “Blackness.”

One of my nicknames in high 

school was “Two Percent.” It didn’t 
have to do with my preference for 
2-percent milk, but for the percent-
age of Black I seemed to act like. I’ve 
been told that I’m not Black enough 
and that I “talk white,” and I’ve been 
called both degrading and meant-to-
be-endearing — yet in-poor-taste — 
versions of the n-word.

The weird part of it is that, 

depending on the situation, I either 
went along with it, shrugged it off 
or got visibly angry.

I went along with “Two Percent,” 

just taking it as a joke. But it made me 
ponder what that really meant. What 

does being Black mean? I think in 
that sense, my speech, politeness and 
intelligence were taken into account. 
Those who called me “Two Percent,” 
albeit not maliciously, referenced 
being Black as uneducated, impolite 
and less sophisticated.

And what does “not being Black 

enough” mean? Yes, I know I’m only 
halfway there as far as ancestry, but 
not every Black person has to act the 
same. In times when “not being Black 
enough” was said, Black was used as 
a stand-in for words like thug, crimi-
nal or rebel. I was not that, and a 
majority of Black people aren’t. With 
media perception and stereotypes, 
Black people are often viewed in that 
light and discriminated against by 
way of racist projections.

When I was told I talked white, it 

was implied that Black people have 
a less sophisticated vocabulary with 
a vernacular that is similar to that 
of the slave, Jim, in Mark Twain’s 
“The Adventures of Huckleberry 
Finn.” How a person speaks should 
not be analyzed in relation to his or 
her race. Speech, like other aspects of 
the individual, cannot be used as an 
overarching comparison to a race or 
any other identity as a whole.

It’s similar to how everyone 

doesn’t respond the same way to 
different types of humor. Yes, my 
friends, I know you think this Black 
joke is funny. I myself have made 
some in my past. But for now, it rubs 
me the wrong way, and I’d rather 
you not say it. Don’t say, “Oh, it’s just 
words” or “Sticks and stones may 
break my bones, but words will never 
hurt me.”

Drake, who is mixed like me, 

describes in a few bars some of what 
it can be like to have your personal-

ity compared to that of a stereotypi-
cal Black person in another’s eyes in 
his song, “You & The 6.”

“I used to get teased for being 

Black

And now I’m here and I’m not 

Black enough

‘Cause I’m not acting tough
Or making stories up ‘bout where 

I’m actually from.”

Someone who is white and Black 

(and in Drake’s case, Jewish) is both 
discriminated against for his or her 
perceived Blackness and for also not 
being what he or she was expected 
to be like as a Black person. People 
who are mixed are not only criti-
cized for acting Black and for being 
mixed, but also for not acting Black 
or not acting mixed.

My racial identity has always been 

something confusing to me. I am 
Black. I am white. Neither race is 
monolithic or has certain values or 
rules to abide by. Each person is an 
individual, following the direction of 
how our parents, other people impor-
tant to our lives and society raised us. 
A friend asked me last summer what 
the differences between my two cul-
tures of white and Black are like. I 
couldn’t pin down an answer because 
I can’t pin down my culture. There 
are certain things I take from each 
of my parents — some fit stereotypes 
and some do not.

It’s not that I am ashamed to be 

seen as just Black because of my 
skin color. Like I said, it’s hard to 
tell unless I mention that I have a 
Black father and a white mother. 
It’s just that categorizing me as 
Black doesn’t take into account a 
whole other part of me.

This kind of covert racism may be 

what Black people face every day. But 
I don’t know for sure because I’m not 
just Black. I can’t speak for what the 
Black experience may be like from 
my individual perspective because 
I’m not a Black man.

It’s like the Old El Paso commer-

cial in which a little girl is given the 
decision of hard or soft taco shells 
after her family is arguing over which 
one is better to use for the meal. I’m 
Black. I’m white. Why not both?

A

re you happy with your college educa-
tion? Do you feel you’re paying a fair 
price for it?

I’ve 
graduated 
with 

degrees 
in 
both 
the 

humanities (Arts & Ideas 
in the Humanities) and 
the 
sciences 
(cognitive 

science) and I, for one, feel 
majorly ripped off.

Don’t get me wrong: I 

loved many of my courses, 
especially the ones in the 
Residential College with 
Cindy Sowers and all my 
great English classes. But 
reflecting on my experience 
— the work I did, the work my teachers and fel-
low students did, the other services provided by 
the University, etc. — I don’t see how one justi-
fies the outrageous cost of tuition. How can the 
University and the state, understanding the 
immense societal benefits of education, limit 
people’s access to it and enslave them with huge 
debt if they seek it? Upon reflection, I see that if 
we want to reform higher education so it serves 
us best as a state and society, then we must start 
by examining and reforming the ways many of us 
are currently thinking about higher education.

In our day-to-day lives, we 

students tend not to experi-
ence studying as real work; 
that is, not like the work we 
do when we serve tables at a 
restaurant, or shelve books in 
a library. Even though every-
one involved in higher educa-
tion would agree (if explicitly 
asked) that education is real 
work, we behave as if it’s not.

The ideology of higher 

education today functions 
primarily 
through 
our 

actions, not our thinking about our actions. 
We act as if reading books, listening to lec-
turers and participating in classroom discus-
sions are luxuries (non-essentials) that we 
buy for ourselves, like seeing a movie or stay-
ing at a hotel. We pay $100,000-plus for these 
academic activities. And yet, when we think 
about it, many of us don’t recognize student 
life as truly worth personally paying exorbi-
tant amounts of money.

Even though much of the real work of 

learning is collaborative, and hence neces-
sarily communal, economically speaking, 
we behave as if it’s individualistic — as if we 
were buying a really expensive service for 
ourselves instead of working for the benefit 
of the community. We’ve been conditioned to 
experience studying as fundamentally differ-
ent from other kinds of work — both physi-
cal and intellectual — and thus we’ve become 
psychologically alienated from our labor.

Other workers receive compensation in 

exchange for their work. It’s presumed that the 
products they make or the services they provide 
aren’t for themselves, but for others. And so we 
think the formula of exchange makes sense.

The only way we wouldn’t apply this same 

formula to higher education is if we conceived 
of higher ed as a service we receive, or else 
as work we do mostly for selfish benefit. But 
the services of our university — specifically 
the teaching faculty — demand we recipro-

cate their work with our own. Unfortunately, 
education can’t be so easily commodified, and 
so it doesn’t work well for our predominantly 
commercial economy.

I think those of us involved in higher educa-

tion would do well to revisit some of the essays 
written by some of the early advocates of 
public education. For example, Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau, an early European advocate of pub-
lic childhood education, argued based on the 
principle that higher education ought serve 
the common good. Since in Rousseau’s phi-
losophy, the socialist-democratic state enacted 
the will of the people, he thought the state, and 
not the individual family, ought be in charge of 
the children’s education. As Rousseau saw it, 
“Families dissolve but the State remains.”

Rousseau argued this in the face of a bour-

geois society that generally preferred to edu-
cate its children privately, for the benefit of 
their individual families. Ironically, one argu-
ing for public higher education today faces a 
similar dilemma. Today, the country’s upper 
class sends its children to college primarily 
for private familial benefits (ensuring a high 
socioeconomic position for the family mov-
ing forward, etc.). Consequently, people of the 
lower classes also conceive of higher education 
in this bourgeois, egotistic way. By mistaking 

the ruling class’s selfish use 
of higher education as the 
only use of higher education, 
we prevent ourselves from 
conceiving of higher educa-
tion in all its great pro-social 
(ahem, socialist) potential 
— that is, higher education 
as serving not just the indi-
vidual student but also his/
her community, city, state, 
society — the common good.

When you’re uneducated 

(i.e., ignorant), you’re often 

a liability to those around you (much like the 
GOP’s denial of climate change makes them a 
hazard to the rest of the planet —literally). But, 
when you’re educated, you’re not only not a 
liability, you’re also positively helpful. It dou-
bly benefits those forced to interact with you 
for you to know things, like how to form an 
intelligent opinion about something, or that 
our country was founded on slave labor, and so 
on. Really, if higher education is for all, then all 
ought to be sponsoring you — the individual — 
and your individual education as a way of say-
ing: “Thank you for learning things! Keep up 
the good work! We appreciate you!”

The working class, if it were to understand 

itself as such, would realize that the work of 
studying is basically the same as the other work 
it does, and thus it would not tolerate paying to 
do the work of higher education. We should rec-
ognize how our current ideology of education 
enables us to pay such exuberant amounts of 
money for work that we really do for one anoth-
er. If we’re unwilling to revolt against our eco-
nomic system in general — as perhaps we ought 
to — then we might instead reasonably demand 
free intellectual training prior to entering into 
wage slavery (i.e. professional life). It seems 
that should be among our minimum demands 
from our own government.

ednesday night, CNN 
hosted a town hall for 
Democratic 
presiden-

tial 
candidates 

Bernie 
Sanders 

and Hillary Clin-
ton. At this point, 
I’ve 
watched 

both Sanders and 
Clinton speak so 
many times — 
both on TV and 
in person — that 
I pretty much 
have their stump 
speeches memo-
rized. Here’s a 
radical idea: We’re going to create 
an economy that works for all of us, 
not just for the millionaires and bil-
lionaires.

That said, there were a couple 

of moments last Wednesday that I 
found truly compelling, and both 
were related to faith. To no end, the 
Republican candidates boast about 
their religious beliefs, but on the 
Democratic side, we’ve only seen 
glimpses into how faith affects the 
candidates’ motivations and values.

That changed Wednesday. In one 

form or another, both Sanders and 
Clinton were asked about their reli-
gion and spirituality. And based on 
what I heard, their answers should 
end the conversation that religious 
observance and belief in God are 
necessary to be a leader of this 
country. In fact, as a Jew who wres-
tles with the existence of a higher 
power, I find their views on religion 
inspiring and necessary.

Anderson Cooper, the modera-

tor of the town hall, asked, “What 
do you say to a voter out there who 
sees faith as a guiding principle in 
their lives and wants it to be a guid-
ing principle for this country?”

Sanders went first.
“It’s a guiding principle in my 

life,” he responded. “Absolutely it 
is. You know, everybody practices 
religion in a different way. To me, I 

would not be here tonight, I would 
not be running for president of 
the United States, if I did not have 
very strong religious and spiritual 
feelings. I believe that as a human 
being, the pain that one person feels 
… if we have children who are hun-
gry in America, if we have elderly 
people who can’t afford their pre-
scription drugs, you know what, 
that impacts you, that impacts me.

“And I worry very much about 

a society where some people spiri-
tually say, ‘That doesn’t matter to 
me, I got it. I don’t care about other 
people.’ So my spirituality is that 
we are all in this together.”

If you didn’t catch it, there was 

no mention of God or Jesus or 
scripture. And this isn’t to say there 
is anything wrong with discuss-
ing those things (Clinton did), but 
whether you agree with Sanders’ 
views or not, is there anything we 
should want more than a president 
who strongly values the commu-
nity and its power? Isn’t that what 
America should be about?

I found that Clinton’s religious 

views resonated with me, too. 
Toward the end of answering a 
question from a rabbi about how 
she finds the ego to run for presi-
dent and have humility, she spoke 
of gratitude.

“Everybody knows I have lived a 

very public life for the last 25 or so 
years, and so, I’ve had to be in pub-
lic dealing with some very difficult 
issues — personal issues, political, 
public issues,” she said. “And I read a 
treatment of the prodigal son parable 
by the Jesuit Henri Nouwen, who I 
think is a magnificent writer of spiri-
tual and theological concerns. And 
I read that parable, and there was a 
line in it that became just a lifeline 
for me. And it basically is practice the 
discipline of gratitude.

“So regardless of how hard the 

days are, how difficult the decisions 
are, be grateful. Be grateful for being 
a human being, being part of the 

universe. Be grateful for your limita-
tions. Know that you have to reach 
out to have more people be with you, 
to support you, to advise you. Listen 
to your critics. Answer the questions. 
But at the end, be grateful. Practice 
the discipline of gratitude and that 
has helped me enormously.”

This answer is incredibly impor-

tant because, again, it did not 
invoke God. Yes, Clinton has been 
open about her belief in God in the 
past, but it’s telling that when she 
was talking about what her “life-
line” is, she chose to talk about the 
very human act of practicing grati-
tude — not prayer or other religious 
acts. I find that commendable.

I thought maybe I was preach-

ing to the choir on this issue (pun 
intended). But according a recent 
Pew survey, 51 percent of Ameri-
cans would be less likely to support 
a candidate who is an atheist. For 
context, that is a greater percentage 
than people less likely to support a 
candidate who has used marijuana, 
or is Muslim, or is gay or lesbian, or 
has had an extramarital affair. This 
may be an obvious thing to say, but 
as far as we’ve come in regard to 
LGBTQ rights, women’s rights, civil 
rights, there is still a large amount 
of religious (or nonreligious) intol-
erance in this country. To be fair, 
that 51 percent number is 12-per-
cent less than it was in 2007. But I 
still don’t get why a definite belief 
in God should be mandatory to 
receive someone’s vote.

Gratitude, humility and commit-

ment to community: These are the 
values that should be of importance 
when picking our next president, at 
least in my opinion.

It shouldn’t matter whether Sand-

ers or Clinton believe in God or not, 
because it shouldn’t matter how 
they’ve arrived at those values.

What matters is they have them.

T

he day after Rihanna’s 
ANTI dropped, I was 
annoyed with myself. I 

was so hype to listen to the record, 
downloaded it as soon as I saw it had 
been released 
and got left 
feeling empty 
after a couple 
of listens, 
because I had 
bought into the 
year-long hype 
and had started 
to believe that 
Rihanna’s 
eighth record 
really would be 
a classic.

But why would I think that? 

Rihanna has a collection of singles 
that rivals any artist ever, but she 
has never made a great album, so it 
shouldn’t be surprising that ANTI 
fell short of high expectations. Even 
with some interesting tracks and 
charismatic performances, it’s mostly 
a directionless record devoid of big 
highs or intriguing moves.

And I don’t think I was alone in 

my disappointment. It’s hard to gauge 
exactly how excited people were by 
ANTI — by traditional metrics, the 
album is a relative flop, only because 
Tidal decided to give it away for 
free to everyone — but regardless 
it doesn’t feel like it really captured 
massive enthusiasm. Lead single 
“Work” has performed solidly but 
remains far from ubiquitous, and 
nothing else on the album feels like 
it has hit potential. Given the massive 
build-up, it’s hard to truly call ANTI 
a success.

So now I’m wondering, how 

exactly did we get here? What made 
Rihanna one of the biggest stars in 
the world, and how can she keep it 
up? ANTI won’t drop Rihanna from 
the A-List, and I’m sure tons of 
people will still enjoy the album, but 
Rihanna might have to step it up next 
time if she wants to continue domi-
nating the world. Let’s take a look 
back through Rihanna’s career to see 
if we can predict her future.

Phase One: Turn the music up
Rihanna’s first two albums are 

almost entirely nonessential. You can 
literally stop both of them after track 
one and barely miss a thing. Both 
Music of the Sun and A Girl Like Me 
lead off with enormous singles and 
then drag on through filler song after 
filler song, as if Rihanna only had 
enough budget and industry clout 
to score one big hit for each record. 
(We can talk about “Unfaithful” 
as also being an important part of 
A Girl Like Me, but strip away the 
nostalgia and it’s little more than a 
cheesy young singer’s heartbreak bal-
lad that’s way too Rob Thomas to be 
good Rihanna.)

But two very strong songs is an 

OK showing for the beginning of 
a career for unknown artist from 
Barbados. “Pon de Replay” is a 
fast-paced dancehall track that 
does exactly what it’s focused on 
doing (making people dance), while 
“S.O.S.” takes a catchy “Tainted 
Love” sample and makes it prettier 
with Rihanna’s voice, her lilting hook 
sticking in your head pretty much 
forever. Sure, both of these songs 
would likely be entirely forgotten by 
now if not for the rest of Rihanna’s 
career, but they remain catchy and 
fun today and they’ll easily make the 
cut when Rihanna’s Greatest Hits 
finally comes out (no small feat.)

Phase Two: That Rihanna rain 

just won’t let up

2007’s Good Girl Gone Bad was 

the start of my personal favorite 
Rihanna phase, one she perfected 
two years later on Rated R: the “You 
should be terrified of me, because I 
will slit your throat if you even look 
at me wrong.” persona. Plenty of 
people will mark “Umbrella” as the 
turning point where Rihanna became 
more than just a generic radio pres-
ence, and that song is obviously a 
huge career highlight, but give me the 
Jay-Z-less “Disturbia,” an irresistibly 
produced track that gels perfectly 
with Rihanna’s newfound swag. 
Here, she haunts the sticky synths 
and relentless bass drum, suffocating 
the track by inserting her voice in 
every crack she can find and disori-
enting the whole dancefloor by layer-
ing hooks on top of hooks until every 
microsecond is catchy as fuck. With 
its lack of features and darker, more 
unique production, it’s the first track 
of Rihanna’s career that a lesser star 
wouldn’t have been able to pull off.

Rated R is still one of the most 

badass Rihanna albums. While it’s 
another Rihanna record mostly nota-
ble for its singles, those singles just 
keep getting better, and her run of 

hits just keeps getting more impres-
sive. “Hard” is a radio song that, 
despite its near-meaninglessness, is 
still awesome for taking Young Jeezy 
and barely smoothing over his jag-
ged edges (compare with Juicy J on 
“Dark Horse” or Kendrick on “Bad 
Blood.”) And “Rude Boy” … well, 
I love “Rude Boy” and I can barely 
explain why. It’s just a great hook 
overflowing with attitude — what 
more do you want from a Rihanna 
song?

Throughout the next few years, 

Rihanna sang hooks on festival-ready 
rap tracks like “Run This Town” and 
“All of the Lights” while also releas-
ing Loud, which for my money is 
front-to-back her best record. Loud 
is the most blatantly radio-ready 
album in Rihanna’s catalog, but it 
came at a point when she had com-
pletely perfected the art of the single. 
The big songs here are the relaxed 
“What’s My Name,” where Rihanna 
and Drake get drinks and smile at 
each other over a mid-tempo snare 
and synth beat, and “Only Girl in the 
World” — still probably the heavi-
est shout-a-long chorus of Rihanna’s 
whole career.

At this point, Rihanna is a huge 

star — someone with the guts and 
power to pull a hit out of something 
as ridiculous as “S&M” and make 
listenable otherwise awful tracks like 
“California King Bed.” But she gets 
even bigger from here.

Phase Three: One perfect song
I want to talk about the phrase 

“lightning in a bottle” for a moment. 
It’s a phrase used so much that it’s 
basically meaningless, but let’s actu-
ally imagine what I’d get if I actually 
captured the power of lightning. I’d 
have a blast of nearly unfathomable 
energy, a pure destructive force of 
nature contained within a tiny space, 
ready to level any room, any area it 
gets released in.

Basically, I’d have “We Found 

Love,” a song that transcends all 
cultures with its easily translatable 
refrain, synths that hit directly to 
your pleasure centers and a build-up 
and release that is physiologically 
impossible to resist. It is one of the 
greatest moments of the decade, 
simply two professional escapists 
(Calvin Harris and Rihanna) creating 
the most blissful release and chaotic 
fun that could possibly be made and 
packing it within a three-minute mp3, 
giving all of us all a tool that could 
bring an entire room to a frenzy.

Phase Four: ANTI
I could never understand the 

success of 2012’s Unapologetic. 
Released a year after Beyoncé’s 4, it 
was a similarly confused, toothless 
move toward adulthood, filled with 
boring ballads and terrible deci-
sions. “Diamonds” is easily one of 
Rihanna’s weakest singles, devoid of 
either fun or innovation, “Pour It Up” 
never hits a payoff and the filler feels 
like a 50-year-old ad exec’s idea of 
trap. And also, there’s a Chris Brown 
duet on here?

But somehow from that we all 

decided that ANTI was poised to be 
a classic. That’s slightly understand-
able, though, since the supposed 
previews we got were “FourFiveSec-
onds,” which blew all our minds 
because there hasn’t been more star 
power on one song since the first 
“We Are the World,” and “Bitch Bet-
ter Have My Money,” a single/video 
combination that set the record for 
least fucks ever given, ever.

But neither of those songs even 

ended up on the album. ANTI is a 
banger-free work with a focus on 
vibes and grooves over choruses, and 
that style doesn’t play to Rihanna’s 
strengths. It’s entirely possible that 
the record is a grower, or even a cult 
curiosity, but after “Work” fades 
away there won’t be anything from 
ANTI left in the national conscious-
ness.

Phase Five …
There’s a line from “Work” that 

I’ve been rolling around in my head 
the past week: “Nobody texts me in 
a crisis.” Is it too much to call that 
one line the perfect encapsulation of 
Rihanna’s entire career in the spot-
light? We’ve seen Beyoncé and Nicki 
Minaj hang out and eat hamburgers, 
we’ve seen Kanye with the Kardashi-
ans on E!, but nobody can imagine 
what it would actually be like to hang 
out with Rihanna. She’s the Kobe 
Bryant of pop music — an immense-
ly talented machine whose closest 
thing to a public persona is “winner 
with no time for human concerns.”

Of course, that’s not always a great 

place to be, and when you’re off your 
game, fans will be less forgiving if 
they don’t feel personally invested 
in what you do. While Taylor Swift 
has built an entire brand out of being 

close and open with her fans and 
Kanye has seemingly taken us along 
on every personal crisis he’s ever 
had, with Rihanna, we only really 
see her final product — polished 
hits or mediocre filler. If that hit well 
dries up, there’s little for her to fall 
back on.

Going back through Rihanna’s 

work, there’s a very obvious com-
mon thread: a few huge songs on 
every album and almost nothing else. 
Can an artist build a legacy off that? 
Do tremendous flashes of greatness 
make up for a lack of consistency? If 
the only Rihanna album I’d advise 
anyone to buy is her future Greatest 
Hits compilation, what does that say 
about her as an artist?

So I have an honest proposal 

for the future: Rihanna should stop 
releasing albums.

One of the few things I can say for 

certain about Rihanna’s personality 
is that she doesn’t give a shit about 
the expectations of others. So why 
should she tie herself to the out-of-
date traditional album cycle? We all 
saw what just happened with Beyon-
cé’s “Formation” video —everyone 
I know is talking about it, and it’s 
the only few minutes of work she’s 
put out in many months. If Rihanna 
can pull off a new singles-only strat-
egy, she can be the subject of these 
national conversations multiple times 
each year while only giving us what’s 
she always been singularly interested 
in — the best possible hit songs. With 
just a few killer tracks divorced from 
any mediocrity Rihanna can break 
the Internet every six months, have 
the song of the summer annually and 
leave us constantly wanting more.

Coen’s ‘Hail, Caesar!’ 
peak for director duo

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

The Coen brothers (“Inside 

Llewyn 
Davis”) 
return 
to 

Hollywood with their latest 
film 
“Hail, 

Caesar!” 
The 

film 
follows 

studio 
fixer 

Eddie Mannix 
(Josh 
Brolin, 

“Sicario”) 
through 
a 

day in the life 
in which he 
chases 
down 

a 
kidnapped 

lead, negotiates the marriage 
of a pregnant starlet and keeps 
the cameras rolling at Capital 
Pictures (the same studio from 
the brothers’ 1991 film “Barton 
Fink”). With the humor of “The 
Big Lebowski” and the anti-
climatic aimlessness of “Inside 
Llewyn Davis,” this is Joel and 
Ethan operating at peak Coen.

No clear plot emerges until 

the studio’s mega star, Baird 
Whitlock (George Clooney, “The 
Descendants”), 
is 
kidnapped 

and held for ransom by a group 
of 
communist 
screenwriters. 

Spinning around this central 
plot are a series of overlapping, 
interwoven side stories used to 
illustrate the constant action of 
Hollywood and to cast Mannix 
as a point of sanity in the midst 
of pure chaos.

These side stories include a 

hilarious scene in which cowboy 
character actor Hobie Doyle 
(played charmingly by Alden 

Ehrenreich of “Blue Jasmine”) 
has been unfittingly cast as an 
urban socialite and is coached 
by 
his 
director, 
Laurence 

Laurenz (Ralph Fiennes, “The 
Grand 
Budapest 
Hotel”), 

through the lines “would that it 
were so simple.” It’s one of the 
funniest scenes of the movie 
and proves the staying power 
of a more developed joke over 
a slew of one-liners. Likewise, 
while trying to make sure 
his depiction of Jesus in the 
studio’s latest big budget epic 
“Hail, Caesar!” is respectful, 
Mannix sparks some hilarious 
banter between an Orthodox 
priest who is concerned about 
the realism of the chariots, 
a disinterested rabbi and a 
pastor who wants to discuss 
the metaphorical tangibility of 
Christ.

The humor is varied in “Hail, 

Caesar!” from pure goofiness 
(Tilda Swinton of “The Grand 
Budapest Hotel” plays twin rival 
tabloid journalists) to absurdist 
commentary on faith (Mannix’s 
priest tells him he confesses 
too much and sends him away). 
With an overwhelming pace and 
sometimes 
overdone 
humor, 

every moment of the film is 
an opportunity to make fun of 
a new part of the Hollywood 
machine. At the heart of much 
of that humor is, surprisingly, 
Channing Tatum (“22 Jump 
Street”). All grown up from 
the 
days 
of 
“Dear 
John,” 

Tatum shines as a tap-dancing 
communist 
who 
finishes 
a 

homoerotic dance number and 

then boards a submarine headed 
to the USSR. It’s hilariously 
absurd and proof of Tatum’s 
refined comedic abilities.

Relative 
newcomer 

Ehrenreich 
is 
absolutely 

wonderful as a singing cowboy-
turned-Hollywood-big-shot. 
He brings an out-of-place, yet 
much needed, earnestness to 
the flashy, calculated world of 
Capital Pictures. A scene in 
which he twirls his spaghetti 
like a lasso, trying to wrangle 
his date’s fingers, is one of the 
only times the film allows itself 
to be nothing more than sweet 
— a much-needed break from 
the onslaught of satire and social 
commentary.

“Hail, Caesar!” is bursting at 

the seams with talent, so much 
so that powerhouse actors like 
Jonah Hill (“True Story”) and 
Frances McDormand (“Moonrise 
Kingdom”) are given one scene 
apiece. Everything about it is 
over the top, from the characters 
to the plot to the homoerotic 
tap dance number. And while 
it’s entertaining every step of 
the way, it sometimes feels like 
the Coens are trying to cram 
too much into an hour and 
40 minutes. The film opens a 
hundred doors and can’t find 
the time to close them all.

“Hail, Caesar!” ends exactly 

where 
it 
begins, 
with 
the 

immediate crises taken care of 
and similar disasters looming 
on the horizon. The anticlimax 
manages to still be satisfying 
— a feat that few besides the 
Coens have mastered.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
Greenwell in A2

By ALLIE TAYLOR

For the Daily

On 
Monday, 
author 
Garth 

Greenwell will read a section of 
his debut novel, “What Belongs 
to You,” at Lite-
rati Bookstore. 
The novel draws 
from 
Green-

well’s four years 
living in Sofia, 
Bulgaria, where 
he taught Eng-
lish at a Bulgar-
ian high school. 
The main narra-
tive of the book 
describes a relationship between 
an American man living in Bel-
gium and a young Bulgarian man 

whom he meets and pays for sex, 
and how the relationship between 
the two men develops over the 
course of a few years.

Broken up into three parts, 

“Mitka,” “A Grave” and “Pox,” the 
book also explores the narrator’s 
childhood growing up in Ken-
tucky, where, in the early 1990’s, 
people felt as though their lives 
had no dignity if they admitted to 
being queer. 

“The structure of the book 

came from thinking about what 
it means to be a queer person in 
places like these,” Greenwell said 
in an interview with The Michi-

All of the information that the 

reader learns about the narrator 
of the novel, who is never named, 

lines up with Greenwell’s personal 
autobiography.

“That’s the kind of game the 

book is playing,” Greenwell said. 
“It wants to explore the blurred 
space between fiction and autobi-
ography.”

Greenwell wrote this book over 

three years while in Bulgaria, 
waking up at 4:30 a.m. (two hours 
before he was to teach) and writing 
by hand in a notebook.

“It was the most private experi-

ence of my life,” he said. “To have 
this very private thing become 
public has been bizarre. It’s not 
quite like a journal, because I was 
thinking of it as art, but a very pri-
vate kind of art. But, it is similar in 
the sense that I really did feel like 
I was writing entirely without an 
audience, and therefore able to say 
and explore anything I wanted.”

Greenwell said that it was mov-

ing to see his book placed in a cat-
egory of books and writers — such 
as James Baldwin’s “Giovanni’s 
Room” and Edmund White’s “A 
Boy’s Own Story” — that saved his 
life when he was a 16-year-old boy 
in Kentucky struggling with being 
queer.

“Those books told me my life 

had dignity,” he said. “And in Bul-
garia, that is still the case, that gay 
people are told one thing about 
their life: their lives have no dig-
nity and no value. I wanted to write 
a book that gave those lives dignity 
and that recognized the value that 
those lives and communities have.”

“What Belongs to You” has been 

incredibly well received, with The 
New York Times regarding it as 
“an instant classic,” and Publishers 
Weekly claiming that “it’s the first 
great novel of 2016.”

“It’s a surreal experience. The 

response is beyond anything I 
could have imagined or hoped 
for,” Greenwell said. “Shocked and 
bewildered is kind of what I feel.”

TV REVIEW
FOX succeeds with 
superb ‘Grease: Live’

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

I wasn’t expecting much from 

“Grease: Live.” NBC, who brought 
back the format of the live musical 
a couple years 
ago with “The 
Sound 
of 

Music,” 
was 

coming off a 
production 
of 
“The 

Wiz” 
which 

brought in big 
numbers and 
earned critical 
acclaim. 
I 

questioned 
whether FOX could do something 
to even come close to that 
production, 
especially 
given 

that “Grease” is a fun musical 
without much substance and 
the dialogue scenes drag like 
nobody’s business. “Grease: Live” 
isn’t able to overcome all of the 
musical’s problems, but it is able 
to put the production quality of 
the NBC musicals to shame with 
pure energy and ambition.

This 
live 
production 
of 

“Grease” brings in elements 
from both the original stage 
production and the better-known 
movie adaptation. It opens with 
“Grease is the Word” and replaces 
“It’s Raining on Prom Night” and 
“Alone at the Drive-In” with 
“Hopelessly Devoted to You” 
and “Sandy,” respectively. It also 
includes “Those Magic Changes” 
from the musical, which is only 
an instrumental in the film. 
The book is reworked by Robert 
Cary and Jonathan Tolins (who 
worked on the latest Broadway 
revival of “On the Town”).

However, the live broadcast 

didn’t work through all of the 
musical’s problems, mainly its 

tedious book sequences. Especially 
in the first hour, the dialogue 
doesn’t have any energy or sense 
of direction. Scenes happen, but 
moments like Sandy (Julianne 
Hough, “Dancing with the Stars”) 
and Patty’s (Elle McLemore, 
“Army 
Wives”) 
cheerleading 

competition are slowly paced 
and way too long. (When you’re 
looking at 15 minutes between 
musical numbers, you can’t afford 
to have anything not work.)

FOX upped the game from 

NBC’s musicals in the sheer scale 
of the event. Director Thomas Kail 
(coming off directing the “little-
known” new musical “Hamilton”) 
was clearly given support to tell 
this story in a bold, audacious way. 
In the first number (“Grease is the 
Word”), the camera follows Jessie 
J around the show’s backstage 
areas before opening up into a 
massive outside set. The scale 
of the live action is much higher 
than anything NBC has done. In 
the dance scenes in the gym, the 
camera swoops around the room, 
capturing the gorgeous dance 
moves in a creative and ingenious 
manner. The production even 
makes the smaller numbers big, 
with usually forgotten songs 
like “Freddy My Love” (sung by 
Keke Palmer, “Scream Queens”) 
and “Those Magic Changes” 
(performed by Jordan Fisher, 
“Teen Beach Movie”) getting the 
full production number treatment.

The musical’s cast is filled with 

a wide range of names and talent. 
Aaron Tveit (“Graceland”) and 
Hough play Danny and Sandy 
respectively, and neither bring 
much to their parts. They’re 
charming and sing well, but 
I was hoping for a little more 
depth to their performances. Ana 
Gasteyer (“Saturday Night Live”) 
and Wendell Pierce (“The Wire”) 

have fun in the show’s thankless 
adult roles. The group that 
shines the most, though, are the 
Pink Ladies: Frenchy (Carly Rae 
Jepsen, who played Cinderella on 
Broadway), Marty (Palmer) and 
Jan (Kether Donohue, “You’re the 
Worst”). Each of them brings a 
sense of warmth and fun to their 
performances and have their own 
standout moments.

The MVP of the broadcast, 

though, 
is 
Vanessa 
Hudgens 

(“High School Musical 3: Senior 
Year”), who gives a career-
defining performance as Rizzo. 
Hudgens’s dad passed away from 
cancer the night before the show, 
but she’s still able to bring snark 
and sharpness to her character. 
Rizzo is the emotional core of 
the show, getting the only song 
where powerful thoughts and 
feelings are shared in “There are 
Worse Things I Could Do.” Just 
thinking about her delivery of 
“But to cry in front of you / That’s 
the worst thing I could do,” the 
closing line of the song, still sends 
chills down my spine and brings 
tears to my eyes. Just watch the 
performance; this is what live TV 
is all about.

By the end of “Grease: Live,” 

I’d forgotten about all my nitpicks 
and bought into the energy of 
the show. By the time the show 
was telling me that it was the 
one that I wanted and that we go 
together, I had a huge smile on 
my face, mostly because of what 
it was able to pull off in a live 
setting. The boldness of the big 
musical numbers and Hudgens’s 
performance more than made up 
for some of the earlier dragging.

NBC is planning to perform 

“Hairspray” in December, but 
they’ll be facing a new high 
standard. The game has just been 
changed. It’s your move, NBC.

WAKE-UP CALL

SHARPSHOOTING SPARTANS BLOW BY WOLVERINES

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

Normally, 
it’s 
redshirt 

sophomore 
guard 
Duncan 

Robinson who puts on a 
3-point-shooting 
clinic 
at 

Crisler Center.

But 
Saturday, 
that 
role 

belonged to a different 3-point 
specialist: 
Michigan 
State 

guard Bryn Forbes.

Forbes 
connected 
on 

his first five attempts from 
downtown and finished the 
game with eight 3s on his way 
to a team-high 29 points, and 
the 10th-ranked Spartans in 
total shot a blistering 14-for-
22 from beyond the arc in the 
game to capture the 89-73 
victory. The one-sided loss was 
the Wolverines’ second this 
week, coming just five days 
after they allowed a 28-0 run 
and fell to Indiana.

“It’s very frustrating no 

matter who we’re playing,” 
said junior forward Zak Irvin. 
“But especially Michigan State, 
we really wanted to win this 
game ... especially when we’ve 
got them laughing at us on our 
home court. These past two 
games, teams have just punked 
us. We can’t let that happen.”

National Player of the Year 

candidate 
Denzel 
Valentine 

was his usual do-it-all self for 
Michigan State, flirting with 
a triple-double with 21 points, 
eight assists and nine rebounds. 
Valentine 
proved 
difficult 

to stop even when double-
teamed, as he knocked down 
an improbable rainbow jumper 
early in the first half with four 
Michigan hands in his face.

The Wolverines, meanwhile, 

struggled to find a shooting 
rhythm, missing their next 
eight 3-point attempts after 
junior guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. knocked down a triple for 
their first points of the game. 
They finished 4-for-16 from 

beyond the arc in the first half.

Michigan (7-4 Big Ten, 

17-7 
overall) 
found 
itself 

down 32-15 after Forbes’ fifth 
3-pointer, but the Wolverines 
made a late push to cut the 
lead to 11 following a stretch 
in which the Spartans lost 
three turnovers in under two 
minutes and Forbes missed his 
first two shots of the game.

The half closed on a 3-point 

shooting 
battle 
between 

Walton and Forbes, with each 
player hitting two triples in a 
50-second span before Walton 
missed a shot at the buzzer 
and sent the Wolverines into 
the locker room trailing by 
16 
points. 

They 
weren’t 
able 
to 

recover 
in 

the second.

Thanks 

to 
their 

two-big 
man set of 
freshman 
Deyonta 
Davis 
and 
senior 
Matt 
Costello, 

the Spartans (7-4, 20-4) also 
had a significant advantage 
down low, which they finally 
exploited in the second frame 
to put their in-state rival away.

Costello took it to Michigan 

junior forward Mark Donnal 
early in the half, scoring the 
Spartans’ 
first 
six 
points 

after being limited to just 
one in the first. Donnal, 
clearly overmatched, wound 
up picking up his third foul 
and sat on the bench for the 
remainder of the half.

“We have to get to the point 

where enough is enough,” 
Irvin said. “We have to have 
the mentality that we have to 
play defense in order to win 
games, especially against these 
past two opponents that we’ve 
played. We’re not just gonna 

beat people by shooting 3s and 
making jump shots.”

Behind Irvin — who scored 

12 points in the second half and 
a team-high 19 in the game — 
the Wolverines made a small 
effort to stay in the game, but 
a 3-pointer from freshman 
Matt McQuaid and a steal-
turned-fast-break dunk from 
Costello brought the Spartans’ 
lead to 69-42 with just over 10 
minutes to play.

Costello made a face at the 

CBS television camera below 
the basket, knowing the game 
was effectively over.

He was right. The Spartans 

hardly let up from there, only 

allowing 
a 

futile 
14-2 

Michigan 
run 
in 

garbage 
time to cut 
the 
deficit 

to 16 — the 
Wolverines’ 
second 
straight 
double-digit 
home loss.

Michigan was without star 

senior guard Caris LeVert 
for the 10th straight game 
due to injury, but coach John 
Beilein refused to make any 
excuses, branding Indiana and 
Michigan State as elite teams.

The Wolverines have shown 

glimpses of being able to play 
with elite teams — it has only 
been a month since they beat 
then-No. 3 Maryland at home 
without LeVert — but they 
are now left trying to find a 
way to fix things after getting 
overwhelmed this week.

“We really just need to do 

some soul-searching,” Irvin 
said. “We’ve gotta get back on 
track. It’s been a tough week 
for us, and no one’s gonna feel 
sorry for us. We’re just gonna 
learn from this experience 
and move on.”

Michigan’s two problems

A

fter two embarrassing 
home defeats — Tuesday 
against Indiana, 80-67, 

Saturday 
against 
Michigan 
State, 89-73, 
neither of 
them even 
half as close 
as the score 
indicated — 
the Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team 
shouldn’t be worried about losing. 
It shouldn’t even be worried about 
being in a suddenly precarious 
NCAA Tournament position.

The bigger concern is that 

Michigan was run out of its own 
building twice in one week.

Two issues are in play here. 

One is that the Wolverines 
aren’t nearly good enough. Their 
coach, John Beilein, admitted 
that to begin his postgame press 
conference Saturday. Michigan 
has played without senior guard 
Caris LeVert for 10 games, and it 
survived for a while — escaping 
Minnesota by five, Rutgers by 11 
and Penn State by seven, and even 
upset then-No. 3 Maryland — but 
now the injury is starting to take 
its toll. Without their most prolific 
scorer, best individual defender 
and captain, the Wolverines had 
no answer for either Indiana or 
Michigan State.

In 14 games played this season, 

LeVert was the team-leading 
scorer in eight, the team-leading 
assist man in eight and the team-
leading rebounder in four. The 
Wolverines started 6-2 in his 
absence, but any notion that they 
are the same team with him that 
they are without him has been 
disproven.

This issue of not being good 

enough is the one Beilein blames 
for the past two losses. He shot 
down any notion of his team 
lacking leadership, mental 
toughness or any other intangible 

quality related to success.

“Our kids are trying 

everything that they got,” Beilein 
said. “Everything they got. 
Those are typical excuses. I told 
them the same thing at Indiana. 
They’re so much better than us. 
… We gotta get better. We just 
gotta get better.”

Moreover, Beilein thinks this 

problem is fixable.

“It’s not about leadership 

right now,” he said. “It’s about 
everybody just (continuing to 
work) and persistence. Time is a 
friend of truth. Just persistence at 
doing the right things. Just trying 
to get better.”

Beilein will help his team 

get better, as he has shown he 
can. Michigan has had more 
ground to make up with less time 
remaining, and has done it. That 
ability shouldn’t be questioned.

Michigan’s bigger problem 

right now, while Beilein may deny 
it, is that it didn’t just lose its past 
two games on its home court. It 
got embarrassed.

With 11 minutes to go in the 

second half Saturday — still a 
quarter of the game remained — 
Michigan State’s Matt McQuaid 
drilled an open 3-pointer from the 
corner. On the next possession, 
the Spartans’ big man, Matt 
Costello, jumped in front of a 
pass and took it the distance for 
a dunk, laughing deliriously into 
the TV camera on his way down.

“You’ve got them laughing 

at us on our home court,” said 
sophomore forward Zak Irvin. 
“In these past two games, teams 
have just punked us, and we can’t 
let that happen. We gotta learn 
from that.”

Michigan called timeout, and 

when it did, Costello ran toward 
Denzel Valentine and locked arms 
with him. Michigan fans started 
to file out of Crisler Center, a 
thousand or so every few minutes 
until the game ended.

Beilein can turn losses into 

wins, but he can’t keep things 
respectable when they’re about 
to get ugly. Saturday’s game 
was 69-42 at that point, and the 
Spartans kept the gas pedal down 
until a hard-earned “Go Green, 
Go White!” chant echoed from 
the rafters.

At one point in the second half, 

Irvin had finally seen enough. 
During a timeout, he lit into 
his team on the bench, with 
another double-digit blowout loss 
looming.

“Just upset,” Irvin said later. 

“Just frustrated with these past 
two games we’ve had. Just trying 

to fire up the guys and blowing off 
some steam. Obviously the game 
wasn’t going our way, but I didn’t 
want anyone to just lay down and 
let them walk all over us.”

Michigan State did. And that 

might be Michigan’s bigger 
problem. Because in a hundred 
matchups in East Lansing, no 
matter what happened, no matter 
who was on either team, the 
Spartans would never, ever, ever 
let the Wolverines do the same 
thing.

So Michigan has to fix that, too. 

And there, Zak Irvin is going to 
need some help.

With 14:02 left in the game 

and the score already out of 
hand, Irvin drove to the hoop, 
drew a foul on Michigan State’s 
Gavin Schilling and scored the 
basket. He pumped his fists 
and roared, begging his team 

to follow his lead and make it a 
game again.

“We were getting our butt 

kicked the whole game, and I just 
didn’t want anyone to give up, 
because this is Michigan State,” 
Irvin said. “They were laughing 
at us. (Indiana) was laughing at 
us. We’re at home. We gotta be 
able to protect home court. For us 
not to care, that’s something that 
can’t happen. We’re Michigan. 
We gotta take pride in that.”

Instead, the Spartans scored 

13 of the next 15, culminating in 
Costello’s dunk.

Irvin made a similar play at 

the 6:48 mark, driving around 
a defender, eluding another and 
floating a hook shot into the hoop. 
Again, he tried to fire up his team.

Instead, the Spartans scored 

six straight points, inching 
toward their largest lead of the 
game.

Irvin cannot win games like 

Saturday’s by himself, but he did 
everything he could to at least 
make it respectable. He needs 
some help, though. Maybe from 
LeVert, when he comes back. 
Maybe from Walton, who carried 
the team for a couple of games in 
January but struggled last week. 
Maybe from another player. 
From someone.

“We really just need to do some 

soul-searching,” Irvin said. “We 
gotta get back on track. It’s been 
a tough week for us, like I’ve said, 
and no one’s going to feel sorry 
for us.”

The Wolverines themselves 

refuse to make excuses such as 
LeVert’s injury. Beilein blames the 
talent gap. Irvin blames the lack 
of toughness. In reality, a little of 
both probably went into the two 
losses this week.

Michigan can fix the first 

problem, little by little. But the 
second, as Irvin knows, needs 
some attention.

MSU’s Forbes outduels Walton

Forbes scores 
29 on 8-for-10 

3-point shooting in 
Spartans’ blowout

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

With the the Michigan State 

basketball team up by 11 on 
Michigan, junior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. ran a full-out, stride-
by-stride 
sprint 
with 
guard 

Bryn Forbes after a ball that 
broke lose on the block ‘M’ at 
centercourt rolled toward the 
baseline. Walton dived onto the 
hardwood, getting to the ball 
before Forbes, but knocked it out 
of bounds. 

Ball to Michigan State. 
He rested on his back and 

looked up at Crisler Center’s 
rafters as “Eye of the Tiger” 
pumped out of the speakers. 
This would be the Wolverines’ 
biggest chance at swinging the 
game in their favor and getting 
within 10 points of the Spartans. 
After allowing Michigan State 
(7-4 Big Ten, 20-4 overall) to get 
to an 18-point lead in the first 13 
minutes, mostly due to Forbes’ 
8-for-10 half that included seven 
makes from beyond the arc for 
23 points, it looked like this 
could be Michigan’s chance at 
getting a solid footing. 

It wasn’t, and the game 

continued to escalate in the 
Spartans’ favor. By halftime, 
Michigan State was up big, 
44-28. By the end of the game, 
Michigan (7-4, 17-7) was barely 
breathing, with the Spartans 
working 
their 
lead 
up 
to 

28 
points 
before 
ultimately 

winning, 89-73. 

Walton, 
the 
only 
active 

member on Michigan’s roster 
from the state of Michigan, 
mentioned that missing last 
year’s game against Michigan 
State was painful and that this 
season, he was going to make 
sure his presence was felt. And it 
was, at times, but his highs and 
lows were always highlighted by 
his matchup with Forbes. 

The game started out with a 

Forbes 3-pointer — just a small 

hint of the onslaught to come — 
but Walton responded on the next 
play with a triple of his own. It 
happened again later, with a little 
over a minute until halftime, but 
this time, Walton struck first. He 
sunk a 3-pointer, and 20 seconds 
later, Forbes responded. 

Then Forbes, a Lansing native, 

attacked again, hitting another 
3-pointer 
to 
close 
out 

the 
half 
on 

back-to-
back 
scoring 

possessions. 
That 
was 

Michigan’s 
biggest 
problem: 
For 

every 
basket 

it made, the 
Spartans had 
more than just a counter-attack 
ready.

“Once (Forbes) got real hot, 

they moved Walton, who’s a 
phenomenal defender, on him, 
and we didn’t get as many 
(shots) the second half,” Izzo 
said. “Trying to get those three 
perimeter guys to guard is very 

important, and Walton can’t 
guard all three. I thought he 
shut him down pretty good the 
second half.” 

Junior forward Zak Irvin, 

who 
led 
the 
Wolverines 

with 19 points, thinks that 
the Wolverines had a bigger 
problem, one involving mental 
toughness and a lack of a 

personal stake 
in the game. 

“I was just 

fed up with 
the way we’ve 
been 
playing 

the past two 
games,” Irvin 
said. 
“I 
feel 

like we need 
to take it more 
personally, 
especially this 

game against Michigan State, I 
mean this is a huge game against 
the best team in the state, and 
I just feel like we weren’t there 
today.”

Though his some of his 

teammates may not have “taken 
it personally,” it was obvious 
who had. 

Walton played a physical game 

up against Forbes, who led the 
Spartans on 10-for-13 shooting 
for 29 points, but Forbes still 
made nearly every shot he took, 
whether it was an open look or a 
contested layup.

Walton didn’t fare as well, 

shooting 3-for-10 for 11 points, 
but helped slow down Forbes in 
the second half. 

“As a kid out of Michigan, you 

definitely want to beat Michigan 
State,” Irvin said of Walton. 
“I felt the same way when we 
played Indiana. Out of Indiana, 
you really wanna beat that team 
and you want to play well. 

“(Walton) fought hard. Some 

of those, he just had to tip his 
hat. (Forbes) made some tough 
shots, but other ones, he had 
wide-open looks.”

Saturday’s 
rivalry 
game 

wasn’t anywhere near being 
a close contest — from tip-off 
until the final buzzer — and it 
was obvious that the Wolverines 
needed a boost, or at least to feel 
a stronger connection to what 
was supposed to be the biggest 
contest of the year.

MEN’S LACROSSE
Michigan falls at 
North Carolina

By KIT MAHER

For the Daily

Lacrosse 
is 
a 
game 
of 

possession, and success starts 
with the basics. Fundamentals 
beat flash.

The Michigan men’s lacrosse 

team 
was 
reminded 
of 
the 

importance 
of 
fundamentals 

Saturday after traveling to Chapel 
Hill, N.C., for the second time 
in program history. Heading 
home with a 20-10 loss against 
No. 6 North Carolina left the 
Wolverines looking at one specific 
area in need of improvement.

“Ground balls,” said Michigan 

coach John Paul. “If I were to 
pick out one thing that we need 
to work on this week, that’s it. 
We really dominated the draw, 
we just couldn’t pick up ground 
balls. That was true all over the 
field today.”

Though 
Michigan 
played 

the majority of the game in its 
defensive end, co-captain and 
senior attackman Kyle Jackson 
led the offense with four goals. 
His offensive surge began within 
minutes of the game’s start.

With the Wolverines down, 

7-3, at the start of the second 
period, Jackson turned up the 
heat with two goals within the 
first three minutes to cut the Tar 
Heels’ lead in half. But Michigan 
was unable to keep the margin 
close, as the Tar Heels answered 
with three consecutive goals.

Jackson scored again with 

5:52 left in the second period, 
but once again, North Carolina 
responded with a goal to make 
it 10-6 with three minutes left in 
the half.

Jackson was a force on the 

field and played a major role in 
keeping Michigan’s momentum 
up throughout the first half, 
and the Wolverines trailed by 
just four at the halftime break. 
Another offensive leader was Ian 
King, who racked up 2 goals and 
3 assists throughout the game.

While Michigan kept it close 

for most of the first half, North 
Carolina started to pull away in 

the third period. The Tar Heels 
dominated ground balls, 13-1, 
added three goals and shut out 
the Wolverines in the period.

“A lot of the third quarter, we 

really didn’t have the ball, so we 
weren’t getting as much of a flow 
offensively,” Jackson said.

In 
the 
fourth 
period, 

North Carolina continued its 
offensive surge with four more 
unanswered goals. Freshman 
midfielder Decker Curran ended 
North 
Carolina’s 
run 
with 

his first career goal, assisted 
by 
junior 
midfielder 
Mikie 

Schlosser. With 9:14 left in the 
game, the two teams traded 
goals until the game ended with 
a final score of 20-10.

Even though the outcome 

was not ideal, the team is using 
Saturday’s loss as a way to gauge 
which aspects of the game they 
need to work on.

“There were some things 

that we need to take a hard look 
at that were apparent in this 
game,” Paul said. “Hopefully, we 
can use this as a tool to continue 
to get better.”

Mental toughness is one thing 

Paul believes his team needs to 
develop more as they head into 
rest of the season.

On the technical side, the 

Wolverines will go back to the 
basics with ground ball practice 
as they prepare to meet Colgate 
next Sunday.

“Ground balls are a pretty 

good measure of toughness,” 
Paul said. “I think all our guys 
would agree that was something 
we had to be better at.”

Playing an elite program, 

such as North Carolina, was an 
opportunity for the Wolverines 
to test their abilities, and though 
the loss wasn’t pretty, the team 
is still looking positively at its 
prospects this season.

“I 
know 
that 
everyone 

worked as hard as they could, 
but obviously we can improve 
in a couple aspects of the game. 
The guys worked hard, and we 
can only move on from here,” 
Jackson said.

‘M’ rolls to pair of 
rivalry meet wins

Men’s and women’s 
teams cruise to wins 

over Spartans

By MAGGIE KOLCON

For the Daily

Normally, 
when 
Michigan 

and Michigan State face off, 
an intense showdown from 
the in-state rivalry is to be 
expected. But the Michigan’s 
men’s and women’s swimming 
and diving teams were all 
smiles during Saturday’s dual 
meet at Canham Natatorium. 
The Wolverine women swept 
every event to win, 180-81, and 
the men finished first in every 
event except diving to win in 
convincing fashion, 173-93.

Despite it being Senior Day, 

sophomore Clara Smiddy and 
freshman Becca Postoll claimed 
two 
individual 
events 
each, 

making their mark on the meet as 
underclassmen for the women’s 
team. Freshman Katie Duggan 
also won the 500-yard freestyle 
event to claim her first career 
individual win.

On 
the 
men’s 
side, 
nine 

Wolverines 
won 
individual 

events. Junior Jason Chen placed 
first in the 50-yard backstroke 
and the 100-yard individual 
medley, making him the lone 
male Wolverine to win two 
individual events. Senior Matt 
McNamara had an outstanding 
50-yard breaststroke, in which 
he edged out Michigan State’s 
Alec Kandt by less than a tenth of 
a second.

Because 
of 
Michigan’s 

dominance in the meet, it was a 
bit of a surprise to see Michigan 
trailing the Spartans in the last 
event, the 200-yard freestyle 
relay. 
But 
Michigan 
senior 

Anders Lie Nielsen came from 

behind to win, ending the day on 
a high note.

“We had an all-senior relay 

in the end there, and we were 
trailing a little bit,” Nielsen said. 
“I just got really excited because 
I love winning. I love winning for 
the team, you know, so I didn’t 
really have a choice. I had to get 
my hand on the wall so I did it.”

The 
Wolverines 
used 
the 

dual meet as an opportunity to 
experiment, 
placing 
athletes 

out of their comfort zones and 
into different events than they 
normally swim. Senior Dylan 
Bosch, an Olympic hopeful, tried 
out the 500-yard freestyle event, 
which was a departure from his 
normal butterfly events. He won 
by a significant margin of more 
than 15 seconds.

“Today’s theme was just to 

celebrate each other and to have 
fun,” said Bosch. “We always 
try to swim as hard as we can 
in everything we do. I think 
it’s actually kind of good to not 
always put a huge emphasis on 
your event and the three that 
you’re going to be swimming at 
championships.”

For the men, this win closed 

out their fifth undefeated season, 
and for the women, it gave them 
an opportunity to prepare for the 
Big Ten Tournament, which they 
will be hosting in two weeks. 

“It’s super exciting that we’re 

hosting Big Tens,” said senior 
Sarah 
Kamstra. 
“Today, 
we 

were all focusing on thinking of 
this as a rehearsal almost of the 
next meet, really just working on 
consistency.”

The 
men’s 
team 
will 
be 

resting up for their own Big 
Ten 
Championships, 
which 

start Feb. 24. With the help of 
their experienced seniors, both 
teams have a positive outlook 
for what is sure to be an exciting 
postseason.

SWIMMING & DIVING
Wolverines trounce Big Ten foes

‘Murderer’s Row’ 

continues to 

shine in wins over 
Maryland, Rutgers

By MATTHEW KENNEDY

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan wrestling team 

traveled 
east 
this 
weekend, 

hoping to clinch a third-place 
finish in the Big Ten. With 
dominating wins at Maryland 
and Rutgers, the eighth-ranked 
Wolverines are guaranteed at 
least that finish.

The wins come a week after 

Michigan (7-1 Big Ten, 12-2 
overall) suffered a blowout loss 
to No. 1 Penn State.

“Everybody 
knew 
what 

needed to be done and how we 
needed to bounce back,” said 
junior captain Adam Coon. “The 
team is really great in that it can 
bounce back and continue to 
fight. It doesn’t need someone 
to fire them up. Everybody is 
self-motivated and able to get 
himself up and get the job done.”

The Wolverines’ first East 

Coast 
test 
was 
Friday 
at 

Maryland. The first four weight 
classes traded decisions to tie 
the match at 6-6. After those, 
however, it was all Michigan.

Junior Brian Murphy and 

sophomore Garrett Sutton, the 
157- and 165-pound wrestlers, 
respectively, 
each 
won 

decisions 
to make the 
match 
score 

12-6. 
From 

there, 
things 

only 
got 

worse for the 
Terrapins 
as 
the 

Wolverines’ 
so-called 
“Murderer’s Row” took the floor.

Redshirt sophomore Aaron 

Calderon pinned the Maryland 

wrestler 
in 
the 
177-pound 

round to garner six points for 
Michigan. After a major decision 
by junior Domenic Abounader, 
the No. 4 184-pound wrestler 
in the country, and a technical 
fall forced by sixth-year senior 
Max Huntley, the No. 6 197-
pound wrestler in the country, 

the scoreboard 
read 
27-6 

and 
victory 

was 
all 
but 

assured for the 
Wolverines.

Still in store, 

though, 
was 

heavyweight 
Adam 
Coon, 

who registered 
Michigan’s 
second pin of 

the day to cap a 33-6 victory.

Two 
days 
later, 
the 

Wolverines moved from College 

Park to Piscataway to take on 
No. 12 Rutgers.

The 
match 
against 
the 

Scarlet Knights proved to be a 
lot tougher than Friday’s bout, 
with Rutgers taking a 16-10 
lead with just three weight 
classes remaining. Those three 
weight classes, though, were all 
Michigan needed.

Abounader 
started 
the 

comeback for Michigan with 
a five-point technical fall in 
the 184-pound match. His big 
performance was followed by 
Huntley, who had an even bigger 
six-point pin in the 197-pound 
bout. With one match remaining, 
Michigan had suddenly jumped 
out to a 21-16 lead.

Still, 
though, 
the 
match 

was not over, as Rutgers could 
potentially tie or take the lead. 
Coon, an All-American, made 
sure that didn’t happen, pinning 

the 
Rutgers 
heavyweight 

wrestler to guarantee a 27-16 
victory for the Wolverines.

“I got to my attacks right 

away 
and 
there’s 
always 

improvement to make,” Coon 
said. “But overall, I had a couple 
solid matches and was happy 
with this weekend.”

The 
weekend 
sweep 
was 

especially impressive given the 
proximity of the two matches 
and the fact that they were both 
on the road.

“(Two weekend road meets) 

definitely prepares them,” said 
Michigan assistant coach Sean 
Bormet. “Rutgers has a good 
arena for wrestling, they have a 
good crowd — it’s a loud crowd, 
it’s a real excitable crowd. It was 
great for our guys to compete in 
that kind of environment again. 
That’s what it’s like at the Big 
Tens and the NCAAs.”

Alec Pantaleo and the Michigan wrestling team bounced back from a loss to Penn State for a strong weekend showing.

“That’s what it’s 

like at the 

Big Tens and 
the NCAAs.”

Wolverines go 2-1 
in weekend series

Loss to Georgia 
spoils otherwise 
strong weekend 

for Michigan 

By MIKE PERSAK 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

tennis team has been steadily 
climbing the rankings this year, 
and the ITA National Indoor 
Championship in Madison gave 
the team another opportunity 
to impress against some of its 
toughest competition of the 
year.

A loss to No. 2 Georgia (5-1) 

marred what was an otherwise 
successful 
weekend 
for 
the 

Wolverines 
(4-2), 
who 
beat 

No. 11 Miami (4-2) and No. 18 
Louisiana State (6-2).

“It’s 
definitely 
a 
tough 

weekend with three in a row,” 
said Michigan coach Ronni 
Bernstein. “Each team is tough. 
There’s no easy match when 
you come (to the ITA National 
Indoor Championship).”

Michigan’s biggest test came 

Saturday 
against 
the 

Bulldogs, but 
it was unable 
to pull off the 
upset. 
The 

bottom of the 
Wolverines’ 
lineup 
struggled 
to 

get 
anything 

going 
in 
a 

match 
that 

they lost, 4-1.

Back-end 
struggles 
have 

been a theme so far this year 
for Michigan, something the 
team will need to improve in the 
future.

“It’s just kind of the top of 

the lineup coming through right 
now,” Bernstein said. “So we 
just have to work on that, get 
everybody getting it done.”

Despite 
this 
loss, 
the 

Wolverines felt good about its 
weekend overall, successfully 
fulfilling the expectations they 
set for themselves in every 
match.

“As far as how we competed 

all weekend, I’m really happy 
with the girls,” Bernstein said. 
“I feel like coming away, we 
competed really hard, and we 
talk about that a lot.”

Michigan was led in its 

matches by freshman Brienne 
Minor, 
who 
was 
the 
only 

Wolverine to go undefeated in 
singles matches over the three-
day tournament. While the first-
year player is new to the scene, 
she has been impressive the 
entire season, and it should be 
no surprise to see her as one of 
the top performers on the team.

“Her 
level 
has 
really 

exploded,” 
Bernstein 
said. 

“She’s coming and volleying and 
not just relying on her ground 
strokes, which are amazing. But 
she’s just playing at a high level. 
She’s playing loose and she’s 
playing confident.”

It was this kind of play that 

led Michigan to its two wins on 
the weekend, and the kind of 
play that has gained the team 

some national 
recognition 
this year. But 
the team tries 
not to focus 
on 
rankings 

or what others 
say about their 
team.

“It’s 
still 

early, 
so 
I 

don’t 
know 

how accurate 

(the rankings) are,” Bernstein 
said. “You just have to keep 
winning, and the rankings will 
come.”

Next weekend the Wolverines 

will host Notre Dame in hopes 
of continuing the winning ways 
of their young season. If they 
do, whether the team wants to 
acknowledge it or not, there’s no 
doubt they will continue to rise 
in national prominence.

“You just have 
to keep winning 
and the rankings 

will come.”

Michigan sweeps Blue Devils

Wolverines rout 

No. 25 Duke, 

continue five-match 

winning streak

By JARED BERSON

For the Daily 

The Michigan men’s tennis 

team’s 
hot 
start 
Sunday 

should’ve served as a warning 
for No. 25 
Duke 
that 

the ranking 
didn’t 
intimidate the Wolverines. After 
earning the doubles point with 
a 2-0 sweep, Michigan didn’t 
let up, sweeping Duke 7-0 to 
extend a stretch in which the 
Wolverines are 32-1 over their 
last five matches.

Michigan 
juniors 
Jathan 

Malik 
and 
Tyler 
Gardiner 

opened doubles play by taking 
a 5-0 lead and cruising to a 6-2 

win. Sophomore Runhao Hua 
and redshirt sophomore Alex 
Knight then completed a rally 
from being down, 4-2, to take 
the No. 1 doubles game 6-4 and 
secure the doubles point for 
Michigan.

The 
doubles 
momentum 

that Michigan built paid off 
immediately, as Hua jumped 
all over Blue Devil TJ Pura, 
establishing a 5-0 lead in the first 
set of his singles match before 
closing it 6-3. Michigan won all 
six opening sets of singles action, 
continuing its strong run of play.

The No. 1 singles match, 

which 
featured 
Duke 

sophomore Nicolas Alvarez, a 
2015 All-American and Malik, a 
British international student in 
his first year with the Michigan 
program, did not disappoint. 
Malik dominated the first set, 
6-2, but Alvarez came back with 
an early break in the second set. 
Malik got the break back for 
4-4 in the second, displaying 
superior net skills to win break 

point. Alvarez started showing 
frustration after being broken 
in the second set and really 
appeared flustered when Malik 
clipped 
an 
alley-line 
from 

beyond the baseline to gain 
a 5-4 advantage. A beautiful 
lob at 5-4, 15-15, sparked the 
break that clinched the match 
for Malik. At match point, the 
crowd clapped for Malik, who 
kept Alvarez deep beyond the 
baseline and finished the match 
with a clinical volley to claim a 
6-2, 6-4, victory for Michigan.

“When I play my best, I don’t 

think there’s very many players 
in college tennis who can beat 
me,” Malik said following his 
impressive performance.

Michigan junior Kevin Wong 

finished off his Blue Devil 
opponent quickly, breezing past 
Ryan Dickerson, 6-2, 6-2. Just 
minutes after Malik closed out 
his win over Alvarez, Knight 
polished off Catalin Mateas, 6-4, 
6-2, and the Wolverines went 
up, 4-0, to clinch the match. The 

Wolverines clinched the match 
in only one hour and 52 minutes, 
sweeping all eight matches that 
were finished and improving the 
team’s record to 5-1 overall.

But Michigan did not let up. 

Hua, a sophomore from Shanghai, 
ended his strong performance on 
the day with a commanding 6-4, 
6-3 win over Pura, and Michigan 
sophomore Carter Lin pulled out 
a tough 3-set match over Duke 
senior Josh Levine, winning 6-4, 
4-6, 6-4.

“We have no seniors, and that’s 

really unusual, to have the same 
team returning,” said Michigan 
coach Adam Steinberg. “My goal 
was to get these guys together by 
this year… and I feel like we can 
go from a good team and become 
great.” 

Regardless 
of 
a 
lack 
of 

experience, 
the 
Wolverines 

believe they can succeed. 

“We can be the best team in 

the country,” Knight said. “We 
know we have a chance to win 
every spot.”

Wolverines salvage split

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

EAST 
LANSING 
— 
The 

Michigan 
hockey 
team 
had 

everything to lose. And entering 
Saturday’s 
matchup, 
the 

Wolverines were already hurting.

After sweeping then-No. 15 

Penn State, Michigan faltered 
in a rivalry loss to Michigan 
State in Joe Louis Arena — its 
first loss since Dec. 12 — and the 
circumstances surrounding the 
defeat made it hurt even more.

The 
Wolverines 
gave 
the 

Spartans the first taste of lifting 
the ‘Iron D’ trophy. They fell at 
the hands of an opponent that 
boasted just two wins in the 
Big Ten, on a night when senior 
goaltender Steve Racine had 
arguably his best performance 
of the season.

And as if that weren’t enough, 

the Wolverines allowed Michigan 
State to send them plummeting in 
the PairWise Rankings.

But Saturday in East Lansing, 

No. 5 Michigan (8-2-2-1 Big Ten, 
17-4-4 overall) set the tone from 
the opening whistle, ensuring 
lightning wouldn’t strike twice 
and capturing a 4-1 victory.

“I 
think 
(Friday’s) 
loss 

really sunk in with us,” said 
senior forward Justin Selman. 
“We hadn’t really faced much 
adversity in a while. As much 
as it stinks to lose, it was a good 
little wake-up call for us late in 
the season. It kind of gave us a 
second gear today.”

With 14 minutes gone in 

the second period, though, the 
Spartans weren’t making it easy 
for Michigan. The Wolverines 
were 
holding 
onto 
their 

advantage, but after Michigan 
State (3-9-0-0, 7-19-2) rattled 
the post twice and started 
forcing Racine to work, their 
one-goal lead seemed destined 
to be erased. Then Michigan 
found an answer from the place 
people have grown to expect — 
its first line.

Junior forward JT Compher 

picked up the puck and fed it 
to junior forward Tyler Motte 
in the slot. The puck wasn’t on 
Motte’s stick for long, though, as 
he threaded the needle between 
two defenders back to Compher 
down low.

The 
Wolverine 
captain 

coasted across the crease and 
coolly finished the chance before 
pounding the glass in celebration.

The 
horn 

sounded. 
Michigan, 2-0. 

“We 
knew 

the things we 
did 
wrong 

last 
night,” 

said 
junior 

forward Tyler 
Motte. 
“We 

didn’t 
really 

capitalize 
on 
chances. 

It wasn’t a matter of effort or 
attitude. We knew coming into 
this building we had to have 
another good start, and that’s 
where our mindset was.”

The Wolverines were the first 

to find twine — the only time 

they have scored first in four 
games against the Spartans this 
year. Just over eight minutes into 
the first period, Selman picked 
up a loose puck and fired from 
the slot, beating Michigan State 
goaltender Jake Hildebrand and 
giving Michigan the lead.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

outshot the Spartans, 20-3, 
in the first period, Michigan 
couldn’t generate many quality 

chances, 
and 

Selman’s 
finish was the 
only one of the 
frame. 
After 

Compher 
lit 

the 
lamp, 

though, 
the 

goals seemed 
to 
come 
in 

bunches 
for 
the 

Wolverines.

Just 
under 
two 
minutes 

into the third period, Selman 
notched his second of the night 
on a finish in front. The goal 
wouldn’t have been possible if 
not for the effort of freshman 
forward Brendan Warren, who 

battled for a puck behind the net 
before feeding Selman for the 
easy opportunity.

Michigan’s fourth tally came 

from Motte, good for his 25th 
goal of the season.

“It’s something we talked 

about 
in 
the 
intermission,” 

Motte said. “He saw that their 
two forwards were shadowing 
on both sides, so I tried to get 
some speed up the middle. I 
didn’t think I was going to be 
in on a clear breakaway… but it 
was something that (Werenski) 
called out in the locker room and 
we went with it.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
blueliners 

looked 
much-improved 

throughout the matchup, as the 
Spartans’ only goal came on the 
power play off the stick of Villiam 
Haag. Racine built on his strong 
Friday night outing, ending with 
32 saves on the night.

The weekend was in no way 

perfect for Michigan. But with 
their backs against the wall, 
the Wolverines had the option 
of crumbling under pressure or 
rising in the wake of adversity. 
And they chose the latter.

ICE HOCKEY
Racine stars vs. 
Michigan State

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

EAST LANSING — As the 

Michigan hockey team stood 
in line to shake hands with 
Michigan State following its 4-1 
victory over its in-state rival, 
senior goaltender Steve Racine 
stood at the end of the line.

He shook every Spartan hand 

before he reached Michigan State 
goaltender Jake Hildebrand, his 
counterpart on the other side 
of the ice. Racine gave him a tap 
on the stomach, acknowledging 
the pair’s play over the weekend, 
which featured 149 saves between 
the two goaltenders.

After 
Hildebrand 
was 

victorious Friday night following 
the Spartans’ 3-2 overtime win 
at Joe Louis Arena, Racine got 
the better of the matchup in the 
second game.

But 
the 
two 
netminders 

weren’t particularly to blame for 
either outcome. Neither team 
scored what seemed like a “bad” 
goal for the goaltender.

This was especially true for 

Racine, who gave up three goals 
Friday and one Saturday.

Friday, Michigan State’s goals 

came from a penalty shot, a 
Spartan left all alone in front of 
the net and a power-play goal. 
While Saturday, Racine gave up 
only one goal on the power play.

Racine’s 
performance 
in 

East Lansing marked just the 
second time all season that 
the Wolverines have held an 
opponent to one goal or fewer, 
with the first back in November 
against Dartmouth.

“I think my game has been 

on track the last couple weeks,” 
Racine said. “The guys have been 
playing really well in front of me.”

More 
importantly, 
Racine 

bailed out Michigan when it 
needed him to.

As has been a trend all season, 

the Wolverines gave the puck 
away multiple times in the 
defensive zone, resulting in open 
shots from dangerous areas. But 
Racine was up to the task, stoning 
the Spartan skaters both nights.

“They actually have a couple 

good forwards, and they generate 
chances,” Racine said. “I think I 
got lucky a couple times, and the 
puck hit the post, but other than 
that, (the defense) did a good job 
of limiting their chances, and you 
saw that on the scoreboard.”

While Racine’s record since 

the Great Lakes Invitational, 
where he returned from an injury 
sustained in November, has been 
9-1-1, he believes his confidence 
has been level throughout.

“I think my confidence has 

been pretty good all year,” Racine 
said. “(Michigan assistant coach 
Steve Shields) helps a lot with 
that. It’s just about working hard 
in practice and getting better 
every day, and I think that’s 
where it comes from. When I’m 
practicing well, it seems to be 
that the weekends go pretty well 
as well.”

And with the offense playing 

the way it has been, averaging 
4.79 goals per game, Racine and 
the defensive play are key to 
Michigan’s play down the stretch.

“(Team defense) is still a work 

in progress,” Racine said. “But 
we’re getting better every week, 
and we know we can score goals. 
It’s about limiting the other team’s 
chances, and we’ll be unbeatable.”

Last season, Michigan was 

unable 
to 
find 
consistency 

between 
Racine 
and 
junior 

goaltender Zach Nagelvoort, with 
the duo switching off throughout 
the season.

But with Racine playing the 

way he has the last two months, 
those 
days 
of 
inconsistent 

goaltending may be over.

Michigan downs Illini

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

After taking a proverbial punch 

in the gut by losing to No. 17 
Michigan State Wednesday, the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team had to 
pick itself up in time for a matchup 
against Illinois.

Sunday, the Wolverines dealt 

the punches, downing the Big 
Ten’s last-place team, 96-83.

“Going into MSU, we didn’t 

play how we wanted to,” said 
freshman center Hallie Thome. 
“So coming out today, we knew 
we had to pick it up. As you saw 
from the start, we had ourselves 
together, and knew we needed to 
get this W.”

Michigan (5-7 Big Ten, 13-10 

overall) began the game with a 
four-guard lineup to match up 
with the Fighting Illini’s similar 
starting 
five. 
This 
allowed 

freshman guard Boogie Brozoski 
to make the first start of her career.

With quicker feet on the floor, 

the Wolverines turned up the 
defensive intensity early, forcing 
Illinois (1-11, 8-15) to commit four 
turnovers in the first four minutes. 
With the swipes and corralled 
loose balls, Michigan turned the 
Illini’s errors into a nine-point 
lead. Illinois added insult to injury 
with sloppy ball handling, turning 
the ball over five more times in the 
first quarter to fall behind, 27-17.

“I think having a four-guard 

lineup makes it easy for us to 
press and pressure the ball,” 
said sophomore guard Katelynn 
Flaherty. “We have a motor 
and energy and emotion. In the 
beginning of games, we’ve gotten 
off to bad starts and we were 
all over the floor, and our guard 
lineup was quick today.”

Meanwhile, Flaherty — who 

has been getting off to slow starts 
in recent games — was almost 
perfect from the floor. She racked 
up 14 points in the first stanza 
alone on 6-for-7 shooting.

Flaherty 
scored 
her 
16th 

point with 3:56 left in the second 
quarter. With that basket, she 
became 
the 
26th 
player 
in 

program history to score 1,000 

points. She is just the second 
player to reach the mark by her 
sophomore season. She would go 
on to earn a career-high 36 points.

While Flaherty and the rest 

of the Wolverines were lighting 
up the scoreboard, the Illini 
struggled, 
knocking 
down 

just nine field goals in the first 
half. They frequently missed 
shots down low and killed any 
momentum with 11 first-half 
turnovers. Illinois shot 39 percent 
in the first half, but was down 
48-36 at halftime after shooting 
14-for-14 from the free throw line.

In comparison, Michigan shot 

59 percent, bolstered by 21 points 
off of turnovers — most of them 
layups in transition.

“We picked up, pressed and 

were super aggressive from the 
start,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico. “In the first half, 
that transition off of those forced 
turnovers and easy buckets really 
helped us to establish a presence 
and gain a lead pretty early.”

The 
12-point 
lead 
seemed 

much larger, as the Wolverines 

seemed to control nearly every 
facet of the game, outshooting and 
outhustling their opponent.

Illinois cut the deficit to single 

digits three minutes into the third 
quarter and added onto it with a 
3-pointer. But Flaherty halted the 
run on her own, nailing back-to-
back 3s to put Michigan back up 
by 12. Along with Flaherty, the 
Wolverines’ post players were 
integral in building on the lead. 
Senior forward Kelsey Mitchell 
started 4-for-6 in the paint, and 
Thome started a perfect 5-for-5, 
missing only one of her eight shots 
from the charity stripe.

“When I go to the free throw 

line, I can’t think much,” Thome 
said. “I just gotta do it, take my 
time, and make sure I’m all good.”

The Illini cut the lead inside 

10 again with a minute left in the 
third, trailing, 71-64, going into 
the fourth quarter. But thanks to 
a combined 61 points from Thome 
and Flaherty, the lead never 
dipped below seven, as Michigan 
maintained a comfortable lead 
until the final buzzer.

Flaherty reaches 1,000 points

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Just when Katelynn Flaherty 

started to heat up and come closer 
to a career milestone, she had to 
wait just a little longer.

For a seven-and-a-half-minute 

stretch that began in the first 
quarter, the sophomore guard 
went cold and couldn’t get a good 
look at the basket to make her 
mile shot.

Even though she knew she was 

close to breaking 1,000 career 
points — only one basket to be 
exact — Flaherty was just focused 
on ensuring a win for the Michigan 
women’s basketball team, which 
had just endured its worst loss of 
the season to Michigan State four 
days prior.

Between the two shots she let 

off during her scoreless span, one 
was an air ball and the other hit 
the front of the rim before falling 
into the hands of Illinois’ defense.

But 39 seconds later, they left 

Flaherty alone in the corner, and 
she returned to form.

Flaherty grabbed the bounce 

pass, bent her right knee in, flung 
the ball up and watched the net 
swoosh as she became the 26th 
player in program history to reach 
1,000 career points.

As 
the 
second 
sophomore 

ever and second-fastest player 
in program history to reach the 
landmark, Flaherty’s performance 
didn’t sway thereafter. In fact, she 
didn’t miss a shot for the next 20 
minutes, as she scored a career-
high 36-points to cap off the 
Wolverines’ 96-83 win Sunday.

“Katelynn Flaherty, holy cow,” 

said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “She’s something special. 
I’m just getting so accustomed to 
her doing this night in and night 
out, I didn’t even realize that she 
scored 36 points until the end of 
the game.”

Added Flaherty: “It feels great 

(to reach 1,000). Everyone kinda 
made a big deal out of it. I’m not 
trying to think about it when 
I go out there, but I’m happy I 
achieved the goal.”

Though Illinois was the first 

team on the board, it never held 
a lead once Flaherty’s first basket 

fell just two minutes into the 
game. On 5-of-6 shooting in the 
first quarter, she helped Michigan 
jump to a 10-point lead by the end 
of the first quarter.

The Fighting Illini were frazzled 

against a high-tempo, four-guard 
Wolverine starting lineup that 
included Flaherty, senior guard 
Madison Ristovski, junior guard 
Siera Thompson and freshman 
guard Boogie Brozoski. Illinois 
committed 18 turnovers total, 
one of which ended with Flaherty 
scoring on a fast-break layup. Soon 
after, Michigan created a 3-on-1 
opportunity that nearly fell apart 
when Brozoski missed the mid-
range jumper in transition.

Luckily for Michigan, Brozoski 

collected her rebound, kicked 
it out to the 3-point line, where 
Flaherty had no trouble finishing 
it off. It wasn’t until later that 
Brozoski 
had 
the 
assist 
on 

Flaherty’s 1,000th career point.

In the third quarter, the 

Wolverines’ 
hard-pressing 

defense continued to show huge 
strides with Illinois narrowing 
the scoring deficit to six points. 
Earlier in the season, Michigan 
may have let this one slip, but the 
Wolverines locked in instead.

If not for the motivating 

loss in East Lansing last week, 
Flaherty may not have had 
the same performance Sunday 
against Illinois.

According to Barnes Arico, 

though, 
much 
of 
Flaherty’s 

success has hinged upon the 
sacrifices that Michigan’s leading 
scorer has made throughout her 
lifetime. Last week, the coaching 
staff had the team read an article 
about how athletes struggling 
with 
adversity 
can 
lead 
to 

success. The main takeaway was 
that “you have to struggle to be 
rewarded,” something applicable 
to Flaherty’s path — including a 
499-point freshman season.

“People really work hard for 

things,” Barnes Arico said, “but 
people 
don’t 
understand 
the 

amount of time Katelynn Flaherty 
has shot the basketball and 
worked on her game to get to the 
level that she’s at.

“The sacrifices and the struggle 

that she has gone through to get 
to this point, it’s so nice to see her 
having the success that she is.”
