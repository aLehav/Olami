In the midst of college
football's bowl season and
winter break, a professional
hockey game at the Big House
will bring life to the Universi-
ty's campus on Jan. 1, 2013.
During a rare Wednesday
morning meeting, the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents met in
a special session to discuss and
approve the National Hockey
League's lease of Michigan
Stadium for its Winter Classic
- the league's annual outdoor

hockey game.
The NHL will pay the Uni-
versity $3 million to rent the
Big House and will use the
stadium from Dec. 1,. 2012 to
mid-January, according to a
communication to the regents
from Athletic Director Dave
Brandon and Timothy Slot-
tow, the University's executive
vice president and chief finan-
cial officer. The Winter Classic
game will take place on Jan. 1,
2013 and has an alternate date
of Jan. 2, 2013.
During the meeting, Bran-
don said the NHL is expected to
donate a "significant" amount
to student scholarships at the
University from its charitable

NEWS BRIEFS
EAST LANSING, Mich.
Michigan State to
require freshmen
to be insured
A new Michigan State Univer-
sity policy requiring freshmen
to either have health insurance
or pay to join a plan through the
school has drawn some opposition
from state lawmakers.
The East Lansing school is the
first public university in Michi-
gan to mandate coverage, the
Lansing State Journal and the
Detroit Free Press reported yes-
terday. The school said that about
25 percent of public universi-
ties nationwide have the same
requirement.
Republicans in the state Legis-
lature have set a Feb. 15 hearing to
discuss the policy from the state's
second-largest public university.
Michigan State University Pro-
vost Kim Wilcox and Associate
Provost June Youats are expected
to testify at the hearing.
"It's a one-size-fits-all plan,"
said state Rep. Kevin Cotter,
R-Mount Pleasant. "The univer-
sity is saying, 'You are going to
have this.' This is mandated cov-
erage."

buildings to close
More than a dozen Detroit Pub-

improve learning.
In addition to the closures
announced yesterday by state-
appointed emergency man-
ager Roy Roberts, four newly
constructed schools will be
opened.
City, Kettering, Finney, South-
western, Crocket and Mumford
high schools are among the build-
ings that will close. Finney and
Crocket students will attend the
new, EastEnglish Village Prepara-
tory Academy. Mumford students
will move from the old building
into the new, $50.3 million Mum-
ford High.
NEW YORK
Yemen killed 270
in revolt last year
Yemen's president, who is in
New York protected by diplomatic
immunity while he receives medi-
cal treatment, ordered a crack-
down on Arab Spring protesters
last year that killed at least 270
people nationwide, Human Rights
Watch said in a new report yester-
day.
At least 120 protesters and
bystanders were killed in just one
city that was the focus of anti-
government demonstrations, the
group said.
The report, based on inter-
views with more than 170

Yemeni experts and witnesses,
provides more detail than the
sketchy accounts of deaths that
trickled out of Yemen last year.

After U.N. veto,
Europe seeks to .
weaken Assad
BEIRUT (AP) - The Euro-
pean Union will impose harsher
sanctions on Syria, a senior EU
official said yesterday, as Rus-
sia tried to broker talks between
the vice president and the oppo-
sition to calm violence. Activists
reported at least 50 killed in the
regime's siege of the restive city
of Homs.
Russia, a close ally of Syria,
and the West are pushing down
starkly different paths in try-
ing to deal with Syria's nearly
11 months of bloodshed. After
blocking a Western and Arab
attempt to bring U.N. pressure
on President Bashar Assad to
step down, Russia has launched
a bid to show it can resolve the
turmoil.
Moscow is calling for a com-
bination of reforms by the
regime and negotiations, with-
out calling for Assad to go. Its
provisions are so far finding no
traction with the opposition,
which dismisses promises of
reform as empty gestures, refus-
es any negotiations while vio-
lence continues and says Assad's
removal is the only option in the
crisis. ,
Russian Prime Minister Vlad-
imir Putin said outside forces
should let Syrians settle their
conflict "independently."
"We should not act like a bull
in a china shop," Putin said,
according to the ITAR-TASS
news agency. "We have to give
people a chance to make deci-
sions about their destiny inde-
pendently, to help, to give
advice, to put limits some-
where so that the opposing
sides would not have a chance
to use arms, but not to inter-
fere."
Russian Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov, who met with
Assad Tuesday in Damascus,
told reporters in Moscow
that the Syrian president del-
egated to his vice president,
Farouk al-Sharaa, responsi-
bility for holding a dialogue
with the opposition.
Lavrov blamed both
Assad's regime and opposi-
tion forces for instigating the
violence, which the U.N. says
has killed well over 5,400
people.
"On both sides, there are
people that aim at an armed
confrontation, not a dia-
logue," Lavrov said.
Rebel soldiers are playing
a bigger role in Syria's Arab-
Spring inspired uprising,
turning it into a more mili-
tarized conflict and hurtling
the country ever more quick-
ly toward a civil war.
In their meeting Tuesday,
Assad said the government
was ready to talk to the oppo-
sition and would cooperate
with "any effort that boosts
stability in Syria."
The regime's crackdown
on dissent has left it almost
completely isolated interna-
tionally and facing growing
sanctions. The U.S. closed

its embassy in Damascus on
Monday and five European
countries and six Arab Gulf
nations have pulled their
ambassadors out of Damas-
cus over.the past three days.

Germany, whose envoy left
Syria this month, said he would
not be replaced.
In Brussels, a senior EU offi-
cial said the 27-nation bloc will
soon impose harsher sanctions
against Syria as it seeks to weak-
en Assad's regime.
The official said the new
measures may include bans
on the import of Syrian phos-
phates, on commercial flights
between Syria and Europe, and
on financial transactions with
the country's central bank. The
European Union imports 40
percent of Syria's phosphate
exports.
The official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity in keep-
ing with EU rules, said some
measures would be adopted at
the EU foreign ministers meet-
ing on Feb. 27. But he stressed
the nature of the measures to be
adopted remained unclear since
the ministers are concerned
over the impact on the Syrian
public.
The U.N.'s top human rights
official Navi Pillay called on
nations to immediately act to
stop the bloodshed, saying she
was "appalled" by the Syrian
regime's offensive against the
central city of Homs, where
activists say hundreds have
been killed since Saturday.
She said the killings show
an "extreme urgency for the
international community to cut
through the politics and take
effective action to protect the
Syrian population."
In New York, U.N. Secre-
tary General Ban Ki-moon told
reporters that the Arab League
planned to send observers back
to Syria and had asked the U.N.

to consider a joint mission.
The U.N. chief provided no
specifics, but the idea appears
aimed at giving the regional
group a boost after the league's
earlier mission was pulled out of
the country because of security
concerns.
Ban called the continuing vio-
lence "unacceptable" and added:
"I fear that the appalling brutality
we are witnessing in Homs, with
heavy weapons firing into civilian
neighborhoods, is a grim harbin-
ger of worse to come."
On the ground, Syrian forces
persisted with their assault on
Homs, the country's third largest
city, trying to put down what has
been an epicenter of the uprising.
The Britain-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights
said at least 53 people were
killed in Wednesday's shelling
of the Homs neighborhoods of
Bayadah, Baba Amr, Khaldi-
yeh and Karm el-Zeytoun. The
group also said that 23 homes
were heavily damaged in Baba
Amr alone.
Omar Shaker, an activist in
Baba Amr, said his neighbor-
hood was under "very intense
shelling" by tanks, mortars,
artillery and heavy machine
guns. Shaker added that he
counted five bodies Wednesday
in his district. The death tolls,
which the groups say they gath-
er from activists on the ground,
could not be independently con-
firmed. Syrian authorities keep
tight control on the media.
"The situation is dire. We are
short of food, water and medi-
cal aid. Doctors have collapsed
after treating the wounded
without rest for five days,"
Shaker said. "We want Lavrov to

Right now the best way that I can impact the world
is through entertainment. One day, and that day will
come, I can impact the world through politics.

Negative political ads subtract from campaigns
uper Bowl advertisements are expected to be funny and eye-
opening, but ads that are openly racist are something new.
Last Sunday, football fans around the state of Michigan looked
on with amazement as a political advertisement degraded a specific
group of individuals. Former U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra's campaign to
be the Republican nominee to face Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) in the
November election turned brutal after a clearly racist advertisement
was aired during the Super Bowl. Hoekstra's campaign team cre-
ated a commercial targeting Stabenow's spending, calling her "Deb-
bie Spend-It-Now," and turned the focus on China and Asian peoples.
Political candidates should focus on promoting themselves through
campaign ads and not try to offensively defame another candidate or
culture. No political advertisement should offend a culture.

For most undergraduates on
campus, the upcoming elec-
tion will be our first as eli-
gible voters. And
while many of
us haven't yet
formally had our
political say, we
have undoubt-
edly constructed
our own set of
political ideas.
I myself have SARAH
developed a ROHAN
political atti-
tude which most
would define as liberal. However,
like all things politics, it's never
quite so simple.
I have at the forefront of my mind
aproblem entirelyseparate from, and
yet utterly pertinent to, my political
concerns for America: the Middle
East. Such a concern makes politics
far more than a simple issue of bi-
partisanship. So, while I tend to be
left-leaning in my social values, my
attitude toward Israel more closely
resembles a conservative outlook..
This concern, however, is just
a personal example of a univer-
sal issue which young voters will
grapple with for the first time this
November. There will rarely ever
be any one candidate who embodies
the entirety of one's political ethos.
We must consider what issues mat-
ter to us most and how we deal with
them when they seem to conflict.
To make an educated decision,
one must be an educated voter. It's
all too easy to define a candidate
by only one of his many political
positions. For example, students
often see Ron Paul as the candidate

who supports the legalization of
marijuana. Oftentimes, however,
the same voters will know little
to nothing about his job-stimulus
proposals. To vote for a candidate
without knowing his positions on
all but a few issues is to inadequate-
ly exercise your right to vote.
As young people, we tend to
be more shortsighted, concerned
mainly with issues dealing with
the here and now. Young voters
are more likely to pay attention to
policies concerning social liber-
ties, such as gay marriage, military
action, job. availability and drug
policies. It's easy to ignore issues
like social security and Medicare,
which will only affect our genera-
tion in the distant future. But, as
voters, we must remember that
whomever we elect will have a say
in these important issues which
affect not only our fellow citizens,
but will likely one day affect us too.
Finally, as inexperienced voters,
we stand in a unique position. Too
often we hear more weathered vot-
ers restrictively define themselves
as either Democratic, Republican
or Independent. Having not yet offi-
cially committed to any party, first-
time voters should take the time to
consider candidates independent
of their party affiliation. In other
words, vote for policies and posi-
tions rather than parties.
Few of us yet possess the burdens
and responsibilities of a mortgage,
paying taxes and facing the costs
of raising children. And though the
issue of healthcare is extremely
important in this election, most of
us do not yet have to worry about
funding our own healthcare cover-

age. As voters acquire these respon-
sibilities with time and age, their
interests tend to shift from "what
is.best for the country" to "what
is best for me." Before it's too late,
let's reflect on and decide what we
believe is best for our country. We
should cultivate a habit of voting
for the well-being of society at large
instead of the well-being of our own
special interests.
Voters should
consider all of a
candidate's ideas.
This upcoming election, I will
have to decide whether to re-elect a
president whose social values closely
reflect my own, but whose attitudes
toward Israel might be less aligned
with mine than those of other. can-
didates. Another student on cam-
pus who identifies with Ron Paul's
stance on marijuana legalization, but
who believes in aggressive foreign
policy, will have to make a choice
as well. I can't tell students which
of their often-conflicting opinions
should take precedence and which
should be swept to the side. What I
can suggest is that students become
versed in the many complex and
varied policies of each candidate. In
this way, first time voters can best do
justice to their own opinions and to
those of their fellow citizens.

Political campaigns have recently become
more negative and demeaningtoward oppos-
ing parties and candidates. The ads have
started a dangerous trend that offends both
parties and individuals involved. Accord-
ing to a National Public Radio report, nega-
tive political advertising in campaigns has
become bigger than ever and continues to
increase. In the 2000 presidential election,
neither George W. Bush nor Al Gore ran neg-
ative advertisements. But today, these nega-
tive ads flood our televisions and computers,
demeaning opposing candidates and their
parties. Campaigns are no longer aimed at
promoting an individual candidate, but rath-
er at putting down the opposition.
Hoekstra's commercial against Staben-
ow's spending record is blatantly racist and
offensive. It shows a young Asian woman
riding her bicycle through a rice paddy field,
while speaking broken English. Surprisingly,
she has no accent whatsoever, yet still speaks
poor English in choppy sentences. These
racist tactics are unacceptable as a means
of political propaganda. In no way should
candidates be running racist advertisements
that are demeaning to an entire culture and
ethnic group. Commercials can change the
way thousands of individuals view certain
groups or think about a different culture.
Political advertisements are aired publically
for thousands of viewers to see, and employ-
ing racist ideas is not acceptable. Political
campaigns need to refocus their advertising
on promoting the candidates and sharing
information with the public.

Not only are negative advertisements like
Hoekstra's offensive, but they are not a pro-
ductive means of campaigning. By degrading
certain individuals and offending a group's
culture, political advertisements don't gain
the positive support they are hoping for.
If candidates began creating informative
advertisements, they would be backed by
hope and encouragement, rather than by fear
and hatred. Unfortunately, negative adver-
tisements have a stronger effect on people
than positive advertisements, but this isn't a
reason to insult another culture.
Political campaigning in the United States
has gotten out of control. Huge sums of
money are spent creating negative advertise-
ments to poke fun at opposing parties and
candidates. Candidates waste thousands of
dollars to hurt the opposition rather than
inform the general public about their own
goals and ambitions.
Political candidates need to focus on creat-
ing informative advertisements that promote
a specific candidate, rather than offending a
certain party or culture. It is unacceptable
to use racist tactics and ideas in advertise-
ments that can prove to be tremendously
degrading to individuals from different cul-
tures. Political advertising campaigns in the
United States are more negative than ever
and in return, we're not learning anything
new about a candidate's objectives and ideas.
Campaigns need to start focusing on inform-
ing the general public, rather than bashing
their opponents and offending individual
cultures in the process.

On the first day of my creative writing class,
I couldn't find a seat. The class was full. I was
forced to steal a desk from another classroom.
After the usual introductions and icebreakers,
my teacher said, "It will be very difficult to get
an A in this clags. You will have to really wow
me." I could feel the classroom emptying.
Creative writing is a class that most people,
including niyself, take because they want to. It
only fills a creative expression requirement for
LSA students. When people were asked why
they wanted to take this class, the answers
were some form of "I like writing and I had
time in my schedule." But when he said that
it would be hard to get an A, all the students
started regretting their decision to take this-
'fun' class.
At the next class, I had no problem finding
a seat. The phrase "it will be hard to get an A"
guaranteed that at least one third of the class
would drop by our next meeting.
Students work hard to find teachers that
will boost their GPAs. They look on ratemy-
professor.com or maizeandbluereview.com,
The Michigan Daily's own teacher review
website. Students look for teachers who give
out lots of As or they ask friends who they
think are the easiest teachers. If things aren't
what they expected when they enter the class,
they drop. And those who stick with it get
punished with low grades for not taking the
easy way out.
I took the class because I had always want-
ed to take a creative writing class, and I'm not
going to lie, I thought it would be a little bit of
a GPA booster. Once my GSI told me it would

be basically impossible to get an A, the GPA I
was aiming for was thrown out the window.
But I didn't want to switch out. It was probably
impossible and waytoo much of a hassle for me
with my schedule, and I actually liked my GS.
Besides the fact that he decided to make a fun,
non-required, non-core class extremely dif-
ficult to succeed in, he was interesting, funny
and seemed to have a good grasp on how to
teach creative writing. I wanted this class tobe
a fun distraction from my other intense classes,
but instead it just became one more thing for
me to stress over. I can't enjoy the class as fully
as I would have because I know this class will
be another dent in my GPA.
Worse than knowing that my GPA will
suffer is knowing that the other people who
switched out moved to an easier section. They
will get a higher grade in the course and will
look like better students than me. I am getting
punished for sticking with my assigned teacher
and not-working the system to get the highest
GPA possible.
I am not advocating grade inflation. Instead,
I am just advocating for a change in the system.
A change that would make grading scales more
universal for each specific course. The Univer-
sity should look at the grades all G5Is or profes-
sors give out in a specific class. If there is a huge
discrepancy between different sections year
after year, something needs to be done. Some-
thing needs to change so students in every sec-
tion have the same chance at getting an A, B or
C. It should be fair.

ne of the most disappoint-
ing revelations of growing
up, at least for me, is that my
life really isn't,
and won't be,
straight out of a
chick flick. No,
my biggest prob-
lem in life is not
having to bribe
my way into law
school " to get
back together ADRIENNE
with my ex-boy- ROBERTS
friend, or break-
ing up with an
attractive and successful man in ten
days so that I can finish a.story for
a world-famous magazine, all while
maintaining a lady-like demeanor
and wearing gorgeous clothes.
No, like many other college stu-
dents, my life is much less glam-
orous. My days are filled with
awkward encounters, frequent cups
of cheap coffee, saying the wrong
things at the wrongtimes and gener-
ally being broke. So when I saw Kris-
ten Wiig portray Annie Walker in
"Bridesmaids" as a single, struggling
and swearing 30-something woman,
I could see myself in her more than
in any other character portrayed
in those predictable romantic com-
edies.
While Wiig was praised for
her role, a growing concern arose
because of the portrayal of women
as ridiculous, loudmouth losers. In a
Jan. 29 Detroit Free Press article by
Georgea Kovanis, women are criti-
cized for losing themselves when
they are crass because it "is very
male in tone" and "we are following
in the footsteps of men." This senti-
ment has been expressed by many:

Women with strong personalities
are viewed as intimidating and
manly.
Kovanis is correct in the fact
that this new-found freedom of
language is a step toward territory
previously claimed by men. But I
think it's totally wrong to think
that women just want to emulate
men and not form their own iden-
tity. Of course, we all need to know
when and where not to use this lan-
guage, but honestly, it can be liber-
ating.
Off-color jokes made by women
demonstrate a certain power that
women are gaining. Think Tina Fey,
Chelsea Handler and Amy Poehler.
These women use dirty humor fre-
quently and they speak their minds.
They are also respected by men and
women alike. Yet, there seems to
be a disconnect between comedic
and strong women in Hollywood
and the attitudes toward women in
everyday life.
The problem does not lie in how
funny or how lame women's jokes
are. Instead, there seems to be a
deeply rooted fear of women with
bold personalities. When Jodi
Kantor's book, "The Obamas," hit
shelves last monththere was a mass
outcry over the fact that this book
described Michelle Obama as an
angry black woman who was overly
protective and harsh. In reality, the
book provides examples of Obama
not wanting to move her children to
the White House before the end of
their school year and having some
difficulty adjusting to her new life.
This sounds like an honest depic-
tion of many women today, not a
crazed and vicious first lady.
Many women have always been

strong, sometimes angry and a little
bit vulgar. Representing women like
this in movies and television, and
now in biographies, is new. The atti-
tudes and personalities of women
are not. Women are not trying to act
like men. They are just becoming
more comfortable showingwhothey
There is a fear of
females with big
personalities.

are and what they think.
It's one thing to think comedic
and strong women are funny from a
distance, but it's another to respect
women who aren't actresses and
celebrities. Women can't continue to
live vicariously through the people
on our TVs. We should be proud of
the people we are with our closest
friends and family, not the inhibited
persona that we share with the rest
of the world.
Yes, women are generally poised,
collected and put-together. But it
would be inaccurate and unfair to
only portray that image. Sometimes,
we have loser tendencies, and that's
okay. There are many Annie Walk-
ers in the world, and the more that
this is accepted, the easier it will be
for women to express themselves
publicly like we do with our best
friends behind closed doors.
When it's appropriate, of course.
After all, we do have standards.

A panel of University officials answer questions from students at Rackham Auditorium yesterday.

but I also realize that as a pub-
lic institution with tens of thou-
sands of students, it is hard and
illegal with the ban of affirma-
tive action for the administra-
tion to make changes specifically
for students of color."
Seven administrators opened
up the event, each giving short
addresses on how their offices
have been furthering the cause
for minority student admission
and recruitment.
Ted Spencer, associate vice
provost and executive director
of the Office of Undergradu-
ate Admissions, commented on
the drastic increase in applica-
tions for admission to the Uni-
versity.and predicted that the
University will receive about
45,000 applications this year, an
increase from 39,570 last year.
"The quality of students con-
tinues to be better than the
year before," Spencer said. "The
number of outreach programs
to ensure opportunities for peo-
ple who otherwise would not
have an opportunity has also
increased along with the appli-
cations."
During the forum, students
had the opportunity to voice
their opinions and ask questions
to the administrators about
minority retention.

expects the contract to be
finalized soon.
Brandon emphasized that the
event is not University spon-
sored, which means no student
tickets will be made available.
"We're not in the business of
marketing this event, we're not
in charge of the sponsors. This is
all going to be the NHL," Bran-
don said. "The NHL is really
taking over the stadium for that
day, and they're marketing the
spaces in whatever manner they
feel appropriate."
The University will use one
of its 12 available one-day-only
liquor licenses on the event. Beer
typically isn't sold at Michigan
Stadium during Michigan foot-
ball games. According to the
communication, the usual con-
cessionaire for football games,
Sodexo, Inc., is expected to pro-
vide concessions and staff at the
. game.

in the last three years for the Big

LSA sophomore Korbin Felder
asked about the decline in the
number of accepted African-
American males over recent
years, noting that the Univer-
sity currently has about 492
self-identifying black males on
campus, a decline from its aver-
age 600.
"How can you explain this
decline?" he inquired. "Is it
because people are not applying
or is it something else? Because
(officials) are talking about all
these programs you have, but
the numbers show differently."
Spencer responded that the
trend in decreasing African-
American male representation is
occurring across the nation, and
added that the number of males
in general attendingcollege is on
the decline.
Another student asked about
the lack of African-American
faculty, claiming that she could
count the number of African-
American professors and gradu-
ate student instructors she has
encountered on one hand.
In many of the cases brought
up bystudents, administrators
responded with possible solu-
tions to the posed problems.
After the meeting, Lester
Monts, senior vice provost for
academic affairs, praised the
gathering for facilitating dia-
logue on a complicated issue

among the campus community.
"I think we need to do more
to create these kinds of town
hall meetings to listen to the
students, but also to inform stu-
dents about what is going on in
these various programs on the
campus," Monts said. "I thought
it was very informative, very
organized and very beneficial to
everyone involved."
In an interview after the
event, Central Student Govern-
ment President DeAndree Wat-
son said the event was overall a
positive experience for students
in attendance.
- "I'm really glad that the stu-
dents were able to participate
and receive some very valu-
able information," Watson said.
"I think that it was extremely
informative and I think that the
administration was able to talk
about a lot of the initiatives and
projects that the University is
doing to increase diversity."
He added that it's important
for students to voice their per-
spectives on issues to adminis-
trators in an attempt to develop
effective future policy.
"At the same time, it was real-
ly great that students were able
to have their voices heard and
were able to talk about some of
the priorities that they want to
see the University accept and
work toward," he said.

"We are able to differenti-
ate very small deviations in the
single-base mismatched DNA
in a very long sequence," Fan
said. "Our technology should be
able to amplify the difference as
long as there is one. However,
we would like to shift to longer
DNA sequences in the upcoming
months."
In the traditional method of
external cavity detection, sci-
entists shine a laser separated
from the sample into a test tube
containing the DNA in ques-
tion, according to Fan. The laser
causes the sample to emit a fluo-
rescent light of different colors,

we've found so far are caused by
incompatibility between Google
Apps and assistive technologies
- (computer) programs that
many people with disabilities
use to augment or replace the
standard computer interface,"
she said.
Vincent specifically noted
that programs like Dragon Nat-
urallySpeaking, software that
allows users to input informa-
tion using their voice instead
of using a keyboard and mouse,
isn't fully accessible using the
Google system.
"What we're finding is that
Google has coded some parts
of its apps in a way that won't
accept speech input," she said.
Bill Wrobleski, director of
infrastructure projects for
NextGen Michigan, said the
University decided to start
working with Google in order
to establish better online col-
laboration tools for students
and instructors. NextGen Mich-
igan works to invest in efficient
technologies that allow the
University to facilitate a better
relationship among students,
faculty and staff.
The transition will allow
students to be able to sign into
their University e-mail accounts
through Google and access pro-
grams like Google Dots, Cal-
endar and Talk. The project
also offers accessibility to the
Google Apps for Education pro-
gram, which provides K-12 and
university school systems with
a variety of applications and
online tools to further interac-
tive learning outside the class-
room.
Rita Girardi, marketing com-
munications specialist for Next-
Gen Michigan, said the program
is working to combat issues for
the disabled community with
help from the James Edward
Knox Center Adaptive Technol-
ogy Computing Site - an orga-

which scientists compare to a
standard for differences that
indicate mutation.
"Our detection method is
different, we call it intra-cav-
ity detection," Fan said. "The
uniquely designed test tube that
contains biological samples is
put into the laser cavity. The
sample thus becomes an essen-
tial part of the laser."
Fan said the detection meth-
od increases the intensity of the
fluorescence, making the colors
more visible and allowing scien-
tists to detect the mutation more
easily.
"If we put the molecule into
the laser to undergo detec-
tion, the small differences that
results from the traditional ana-
log~detection using florescent
light will be significantly ampli-
fied by the laser," Fan said.
Fan added that he hopes that
nization committed to helping
students with temporary and
permanent disabilities cope
with the technological demands
of the University.
She added that Google is con-
tinuing to make its applications
accessible to all users, ad the
University is monitoring these
improvements.
"We are aware that there are
accessibility challenges with
this move to Google and are
mindful of our responsibility
to balance the wider benefits
of this initiative with the needs
of the disabled members of the
U-M community," she said.
As the University continues
to work with Google to increase
accessibility of services, Berl-
iss-Vincent said officials are
developing an online forum
for students and faculty to list
issues that arise and offer alter-
natives resources.
"Ultimately, Google bears
responsibility for products that
are fully usable by students,
staff, and faculty with disabili-
ties," she said. "Until Google
implements full accessibility,
the primary solution will be to
post information about known
problems and any identified
work-arounds ... This list will
be continually augmented as we
find out new information."
Wrobleski said that as part of
the process in choosing Google,
the University held a series of
seetings, online surveys and
product tests from student vol-
unteers to gather input on what
the campus community pre-
ferred.
"It was clear that we need to
provide a broader set of tools to
students and faculty in particu-
lar, but also our staff," Wrobles-
ki said. "Last year, there was a
fairly thorough campus input
gathering process, as well as
an evaluation of the products,
and Google won hands down in
terms of what the campus want-
ed us to move towards."
Wrobleski added that the
transition will save the Uni-

the technology will become suc-
cessfully commercialized in two
years.
"Our next challenge is to
ensure that our technology is
fully applicable in high resolu-
tion DNA melting analysis," he
said. "We know the technology
works, but we hope our method
will be able to provide better
resolution, better sensitivity and
more capability to analyze lon-
ger DNA sequences."
According to Fan, the tech-
nology will be useful in many
fields and have a large impact on
society and health care.
"DNA analysis is very impor-
tant for many fields and appli-
cations including personalized
medicine, medical diagnosis,
and biochemical research," Fan
said. "Our technology could
be involved in anything that is
related to gene analysis."
versity $750,000 a year due to
reduced machine and staffing
costs.
"We can turn off certain volt
systems so we save on hard-
ware and software costs asso-
ciated with those," Wrobleski
said. "Also, there's a lot of work
efforts associated with run-
ning those systems and we can
rededicate that to other pur-
poses."
Girardi said the project will
continue to encourage student
feedback, and she has estab-
lished a Google Guides program
to assist staff members and stu-
dents as they transition to the
new forum.
"We have been trying to reach
out to students to get input on
how to best launch this and
how to bring this change about
for them," Grardi said. "We've
had probably about 160 students
so far registered to be Google
Guides. These are students who
will be working throughout the
summer or spring to assist staff
and faculty as they move to
Google."
Business senior Stepha-
nie LaRue, one of two cam-
pus Google ambassadors, said
launching the project includes
many informational events on
campus.
"As a Google Ambassador,
I serve as a liaison between
Google and the University,"
LaRue said. "I get to promote
Google on campus and hold
events, give out free stuff and
learn more about upcoming
Google products."
LaRue added that she is look-
ing forward to the integration
of Google web services into the
University system.
"Google Calendar and Gmail
have everything on them. I
would have no idea what my
schedule was without Google
Calendar," LaRue said. "Google
Forms and Docs are two of
the services I use nearly every
day for group projects to work
schedules to student organiza-
tions."

Chill of 104,173 attendees.
Brandon said he expects the
event to draw in excess of $14
million in economic activity
to Ann Arbor. Newman added
that the economic boost is one
of the key reasons the regents
approved the lease.
"One of the factors that we
discussed when considering this
was the economic value to the
city of Ann Arbor and the sur-
rounding community and the
goodness this would do for res-
taurants and hotels and shops
and other activity in the area,"
Newman said. "5 think that at a
time of year where it's otherwise
quiet, doing something like this
makes a lot of sense."
Speaking at the start of the
meeting, University President
Mary Sue Coleman said it was
important to discuss the lease
with the board before making
made a final decision.
"Since this is an unusual and
highly visible use of the facility,
we thought it prudent for the
board to discuss the proposed
arrangement and ... vote on
authorization to proceed," Cole-
man said during the opening of
the session.

Six of the eight regents -
Denise Ilitch (D-Bingham
Farms), Katherine White
(D-Ann Arbor), Andrea Fisch-
er Newman (R-Ann Arbor),
Andrew Richner (R-Grosse
Point), S. Martin Taylor
(D-Grosse Point Farms) and
Laurence Deitch (D-Bingham
Farms) - participated in the
meeting via phone. Five of the
six approved the plan as Ilitch
recused herself from the vote
because of her affiliation with
the Red Wings - she is the
daughter of Mike Ilitch, the
owner of the Red Wings, Detroit
Tigers and Comerica Park.
"While I have no direct inter-
est in the National Hockey
League, it is well known that
my family has an interest in the
Detroit Red Wings Hockey Club
and Comerica Park," Ilitch said.
"It is important to me to avoid
any appearance of conflict in
this matter."
The Detroit Red Wings and
the Toronto Maple Leafs are the
two teams expected to play in

s PU.S., Japan agree to move troops.

Thousands of forces
will move to Guam,
10,000 will stay in
Okinawa
TOKYO (AP ) - Japan and the
United States agreed yesterday
to proceed with plans to trans-
fer thousands of U.S. troops out
of the southern Japanese island
of Okinawa, leaving behind the
stalled discussion about closinga
major U.S. Marine base there.
The transfer, a key to U.S. troop
restructuring in the Pacific, has
been in limbo for years because
it was linked to the closure and
replacement of the strategically
important base that Okinawans
fiercely oppose.
The announcement Wednes-
day follows high-level talks to
rework a 2006 agreement for
8,000 Marines to transfer to the
U.S. territory of Guam by 2014 ifsa
replacement for Marine Corps Air
Station Futenma could be built
elsewhere on Okinawa.
That agreement has been effec-
tively scuttled by opposition on
Okinawa, where many residents
believe the base should simply

be closed and moved overseas or
elsewhere in Japan. More than
half of the 50,000 U.S. troops in
Japan, including 18,000 Marines,
are stationed on Okinawa, taking
up around 10 percent of the island
with nearly 40 bases and facilities.
The two governments said in
a joint statement that the trans-
fer of thousands of U.S. Marines
to Guam would not require the
prior closure of Futenma, as the
original pact required. Details of
the realignment will be discussed
further, but about 10,000 troops
will remain on Okinawa, as in the
original agreement.
Foreign Minister Koichiro
Gemba told a news conference
that he hoped the progress on the
realignment plan would help the
two countries step up deterrence
in the Asia-Pacific region. He
also said Tokyo and Washington
would continue efforts to eventu-
ally close Futenma.
Progress on the issue is impor-
tant to the United States, which
is revising its military and diplo-
matic posture in Asia - in what
is being called the "Pacific Pivot"
- to reflect the rising power of
China and increasing tensions
over territorial disputes through-
out the region.
Washington is also under

pressure to make the most of its
resources as budget cuts loom in
Congress with combat operations
are ending in Iraq and Afghani-
stan.
Wednesday's statement was
vague on specifics of what lies
ahead. But senior Japanese offi-
cials have said 4,700 Marines
will be transferred to Guam. The
remaining 3,300 would reported-
ly rotate among Australia, Hawaii
and the Philippines.
Pentagon press secretary
George Little said from Washing-
ton that talks would continue with
both sides working on mitigating
the impact on Okinawa, develop-
ing Guam as a strategic hub and
maintaining an effective U.S. mili-
tary presence in the region. He
also said discussing troop num-
bers and locations was premature
as the bilateral talks continue.
Tokyo is hoping the reduction
of troops on Okinawa will ease
opposition and demonstrate its
desire to stand by promises to
reduce the island's share of the
troop-hosting burden. Officials
say they remain committed to
closing Futenma, which the U.S.
and Japan agreed to do after the
1995 rape of.a schoolgirl by three
American servicemen led to mass
protests.

Lawmakers in New Jersey are

Proposed amendments to ban
gay marriage will be on the bal-
lots in North Carolina in May
and in Minnesota in November.
A three-judge panel of the 9th
Circuit ruled Tuesday against
California's voter-approved
same-sex marriage ban, known
as Proposition 8.
The panel gave gay marriage
opponents time to appeal the 2-1
decision before ordering the state
to allow same-sex weddings to
resume. The judges also said the
decision only applies to California,
even though the court has juris-
diction in nine western states.
Lawyers for the coalition of
conservative religious groups
that sponsored Proposition 8
said they have not decided if they
will seek a new 9th Circuit hear-
ing or file an appeal directly to
the U.S. Supreme Court.
Washington state's momen-
tum for same-sex marriage has
been building and the debate
has changed significantly since
1998, when lawmakers passed
Washington's Defense of Mar-
riage Act banning gay marriage.
The constitutionality of that law
ultimately was upheld by the
state Supreme Court in 2006. But
earlier that year, a gay civil rights
measure passed after nearly
30 years of failure, signaling a
change in the Legislature.

More airports to test
GAtj lower-hassle screening


NATE CHUTE/A
Jeff Giard, right, holds up a rainbow flag in support of same-sex marriage on the corner of Third and E streets as traffic flows through Marysville, Calif after a
federal appeals court declared California's same-sex marfiage ban unconstitutional on Tuesday.
Path to Supreme Court unclear after
Proposition 8 ruled unconstitutional

TSA program
hopes to streamline
security process
WASHINGTON (AP) - A new
passenger screening program to
make check-in more convenient
for certain travelers is being
expanded to 28 more major
U.S. airports, the government
said yesterday. There will be no
cost to eligible passengers, who
would no longer have to remove
their shoes and belts before they
board flights.
The airports include the three
used by hijackers to launch the
terror attacks in September
2001: Washington Dulles Inter-
national Airport, Newark Lib-
erty International Airport in
New Jersey and Boston's Logan
International Airport.
The Transportation Secu-
rity Administration's program,
already in a test phase in seven
other airports, is the Obama
administration's first attempt at
a passenger screening program
responsive to frequent com-
plaints that the government is
not using common sense when
it screens all passengers at air-
ports in the same way. Under
the new program, eligible trav-
elers have the option to volun-
teer more personal information
about themselves so that the
government can vet them for

security purposes before they
arrive at airport checkpoints.
"Good, thoughtful, sensible
security by its very nature facili-
tates lawful travel and legiti-
mate commerce," Homeland
Security Secretary Janet Napol-
itano said.
The program works this way:
Participating travelers will
walk through a dedicated lane
at airport security checkpoints.
They will provide the TSA offi-
cer with a specially marked
boarding pass. A machine will
read the barcode, and travelers
deemed "low-risk," will likely be
allowed to keep on belts, shoes
and jackets and leave laptops
and liquids in bags when being
screened.
Not everyone is eligible to
participate in the program,
which is already being tested
at airports in Atlanta, Dal-
las, Detroit, Miami, Las Vegas,
Los Angeles and Minneapolis-
St. Paul. Eligible travelers are
some of those who participate
in American and Delta airlines'
frequent flier programs, as well
as travelers in three other trust-
ed traveler programs run by the
Customs and Border Protection
agency, which do charge fees
to participate. About 336,000
passengers have been screened
through the program since the
testing began last year, accord-
ing to the Transportation Secu-
rity Administration.

Experts say 9th
Circuit ruling
is purposefully
narrow
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Con-
servative critics like to point out
that the federal appeals court
that just declared California's
same-sex marriage ban to be
unconstitutional has its decisions
overturned by the U.S. Supreme
Court more often than other judi-
cial circuits, a record that could
prove predictive if the high court
agrees to review the gay marriage
case on appeal.
Yet legal experts seemed to
think the panel of the San Fran-
cisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit of
Appeals struck down the voter-
approved ban on Tuesday pur-
posefully served up its 2-1 opinion
in a, narrow way and seasoned
it with established holdings so
the Supreme Court would be less

tempted to bite.
The appeals court not only
limited the scope of its decision
to California, even though the
9th Circuit also has jurisdiction
in eight other western states, but
relied on the Supreme Court's
own 1996 decision overturning a
Colorado measure that outlawed
discrimination protections for
gay people to argue that the voter-
approved Proposition 8 violated
the civil rights of gay and lesbian
Californians.
That approach makes it much
less likely the high court would
find it necessary to step in, as it
might have if the 9th Circuit panel
had concluded that any state laws
or amendments limiting marriage
to a man and a woman run afoul of
the U.S. Constitution's promise of
equal treatment, several analysts
said. '
"There is no reason to believe
four justices on the Supreme
Court, which is what it takes to
grant (an appeal) petition, are

champing at the bit to take this
issue on," University of Michigan
law school professor Steve Sand-
ers said. "The liberals on the court
are going to recognize this was
a sensible, sound decision that
doesn't get ahead 'of the national
debate ... and I don't think the
decision would be so objection-
able to the court's conservatives
that they would see a reason to
reach out and smack the 9th Cir-
cuit."
Lawyers for the coalition of
religious conservative groups
that qualified Proposition 8 for
the November 2008 ballot and
campaigned for its passage said
they have not decided whether to
ask a bigger 9th Circuit to rehear
the case or to take an appeal
directly to the Supreme Court.
However, they said they were
optimistic that if the high court
accepts an appeal, Tuesday's rul-
ing would be reversed.
"The 9th Circuit's decision
is completely out of step with

every other federal appellate
and Supreme Court decision in
American history on the subject
of marriage, but it really doesn't
come as a surprise, given the his-
tory of the 9th Circuit, which is
often overturned," Andy Pugno,
the coalition's general counsel,
said in a fundraising letter to
Proposition 8's supporters. "Ever
since the beginning of this case,
we've known that the battle to
-preserve traditional marriage
will ultimately be won or lost
not here, but rather in the U.S.
Supreme Court."
Regardless of their next steps,
gay and lesbian couples were
unlikely to be able to get mar-
ried in California anytime soon.
The 9th Circuit panel's ruling
will not take effect until after the
deadline passes in two weeks for
Proposition 8's backers to appeal
to a larger panel, and the earliest
the Supreme Court could consid-
er whether to take the case would
be in the fall.

Yet these changes are being
made at the expense of qualified
lecturers such as MacPherson.
Fitzgerald said the department
made its decision after much
deliberation, and gave the lectur-
ers fair warning. He added that
the deptartment has been avail-
able to offer assistance to those
affected. He said the layoffs that
are happening in the philosophy
department are not indicative of a
general trend of lecturer layoffs at
the University.
"I know the department
feels strongly that this is the
right move for the department,"
Fitzgerald said. "Generally, there
certainly are people who would
see this as a positive move to have
more introductory classes taught
by faculty ... tenure and tenure-
track faculty."
Kirsten Herold, vice presi-
dent of the Lecturers' Employee
Organization and a lecturer in
the School of Public Health,
administers union contracts for
LEO, which sets guidelines for
the relationship between lectur-
ers and the University. Herold
said the University is expecting
to have more tenure-track faculty
teaching undergraduate courses
- which has already begun to
happen over the years in depart-
ments such as geology, Spanish
and English - but added that
the situation in the philoso-
phy department has been more
extreme.
"(MacPherson and Sax are)
being laid off because they're lec-
turers," Herold said. "The depart-
ment has basically decided that
they don't want lecturers any-
more. It's not because of the qual-
ity of undergraduate education,
because these two are incredibly
good and popular teachers."
Usually, if a department wants

to replace lecturers with profes-
sors, the lecturers are relocated
within the department to teach
a lower-level course. However,
Herold explained that MacPher-
son and Sax are already teaching
introductory courses.
Herold added there is a greater
distinction between the levels of
courses in other fields of study
and it is easier for the University
to haveinstructors other courses,
noting that lecturers can teach
introductory levels and profes-
sors can teach advanced mate-
rial. But that isn't the case in
a department like philosophy,
where tenure-track faculty teach
lower level courses, according to
Herold.
Herold said the philosophy
department is not financially
struggling since it holds inde-
pendent wealth from private
endowments, and therefore firing
lecturers is not a financial neces-
sity but a strategic decision for
the department to employ more
researchers.
"They didn't have to do this,"
Herold said. "This is not a depart-
ment that is struggling ... in terms
of their budgets. They did it
because they wanted to."
Herold said she is outraged
about how MacPherson and Sax
have been treated.
"I'm really upset about this,"
she said. "I'm so frustrated and
angry about it ... their profession-
al life has been spent here."
MacPherson said the letter he
received justified the layoffs as a
"curriculum change" and called
the letter "very cold, very imper-
sonal."
MacPherson said these chang-
es mean that smaller courses,
which are usually taught by lec-
turers, are being replaced with
larger, lecture-based courses
taught by professors, adding that
increased class sizes take away
from how students will learn in
the classroom. With larger class-
es, mostofthe studentswill inter-
act more with graduate student
instructors rather than directly
with the instructor, he said.
"I think it will decrease the
quality of education because
instead of having a class of maybe
50 students ... now it's this mega-
course," MacPherson said. "You
may not even really get to interact

with the professor at all."
MacPherson added that phi-
losophy is taught more effectively
in a smaller, more personal setting
that better facilitates learning.
"If you increase the class size of
a philosophy class, you're defeat-
ing the purpose of teaching phi-
losophy ... you may as well not
teach it," MacPherson said. "It
makes me feel ... bad for the stu-
dents."
Sax agreed with MacPherson,
and said he doesn't see the ben-
efits of tenured faculty teaching
over lecturers.
"I can't see any principal dif-
ference between a lecturer, as a
teacher of undergraduates, and
a tenure-track faculty member,"
Sax said. "I couldn't say in general
it's going to get worse, unless of
course classes get bigger."
Sax said all student-teacher
relationships begin in the class-
room, and if a class size is too
large, it will be harder for conver-
sations to take place. He said the
fact that tenure-track professors
at the University have to put their
research first can also affect how
well students get to know their
teachers.
"I think I had a phenomenally
good relationship with my stu-
dents," Sax said. "I don't want

to be anything other than what
I have been doing. It's a dream
job for me ... I love my work," Sax
said.
Despite the concern of grow-
ing class sizes, Fitzgerald said
new measures are being taken by
the University to prevent classes
from swelling in the wake of the
new faculty hires.
LSA senior Grace Bowden said
in general, she has had better
learning experiences with some
of her lecturers than with profes-
sors, who are not always as acces-
sible.
"They are enjoying teaching,
they're not doing it for research
as much," Bowden said.
Bowden, who took a bioethics
class taught by MacPherson last
semester, said she is outraged by
the decision to let him go.
"I think it's a huge shame to lay
off people that are really fantastic
teachers just because they're not
full professors," Bowden said.
Bowden said MacPherson
engaged students and challenged
them to consider other perspec-
tives, adding he always put the
class first.
"He was super interactive," she
said. "A lot of professors do tend
to just lecture but he always asked
us questions."

Largest ever study
on region cites
violence as
tourism killer
PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad
(AP) - Rising crime across the
Caribbean threatens the region's
tourism-based economy and has
exposed a weak and ineffective
judicial system, according to a
sweeping U.N. study released
yesterday.
Every Caribbean nation
except Barbados and Suriname
reported a spike in homicide
rates and gang-related killings
over the past 12 years even as
violent crime has fallen or stabi-
lized in most other places across
the globe, according to the 2012
Caribbean Human Development
Report.
The U.N. said it was the larg-
est survey ever to focus on crime
in the Caribbean.
U.N. officials singled out
Jamaica and Trinidad for

alarming levels of gang-related
homicides that almost doubled
from 2006 to 2009.
Jamaica has the world's third-
highest murder rate, with about
60 murders per 100,000 inhabit-
ants, while Trinidad reported a
fivefold increase in its murder rate
over the past decade and now has
36 killings per 100,000 people.
"The report challenges gov-
ernments of the English and
Dutch Caribbean to action," said
Trinidad Prime Minister Kamla
Persad-Bissessar, adding that
she supports the report's recom-
mendations.
The Caribbean Community
trade bloc found that gang-
related crime costs member
countries as much as 4 percent
of their gross domestic product.
Jamaica loses $529 million a
year, according to the report.
"Violence limits people's
choices, threatens their physi-
cal integrity and disrupts their
daily lives," said Helen Clark,
the U.N. Development Program
administrator who unveiled the
report in Trinidad.

'M' boils 'Huskers in Lincoln

Getting to know
Nebraskan custom

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Editor
LINCOLN - On Wednesday,
Michigan basketball coach John
Beilein stepped foot in the state
of Nebraska _
for the first NEBRASKA 46
time. And MICHIGAN 62
after beat-
ing the Cornhuskers handily
on Thursday night, he's prob-
ably sad he has to return to Ann
Arbor so soon.
Following a tight, low-scoring
first half, the 22nd-ranked Wol-
verines rode a 15-4 run to open
the second half to pick up their
second road win of the season,
62-46.
Neither offense could get
the ball to drop early on. By the
second media timeout, Michi-
gan (8-4 Big Ten, 18-7 overall)
was 4-for-12 from the field, and
Nebraska (3-9, 11-12) was just
1-for-12.
Per usual, though, the Wol-
verines were able to rely on
senior guard and co-captain
Zack Novak to knock down shots
while the rest of the offense
stalled. By that second timeout,
he was responsible for three of
Michigan's four buckets, two of
which came from behind the arc.
On his second basket of the
game, Novak became the 45th
player in Michigan basketball
history to register 1,000 career
points.
He is just the 28th Wolverine
to top 1,000 career points and
500 career rebounds. He fin-
ished the game with a game-high
14 points on 6-of-9 shooting.
"I didn't know," Novak said,
laughing about his milestone.
"Maybe if I did it in a timely
fashion it'd be cool ... I've been
playing 35 minutes a game for
four years. I don't think that
averages out very well."
Aside from Novak, neither
offense fared very well in the
first half. Michigan was a mere
32 percent from the floor, while
Nebraska was shooting 22
percent. And neither defense
seemed particularly imposing -
the shooters simply had trouble

NATI HARNIK/AP
Senior guard Zack Novak scored a game-high 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting against Nebraska in Lincoln on Wednesday.

Wit, you do whatrwith
the corn?
Husking, for the
non-Nebraskan, is the act of
removing an ear of corn from its
outer shell. Aside from being a
practical thing to do on account
of the fact that the outer shell
of corn isn't particularly tasty,
one's ability to husk quickly is an
admirable skill and highly valued
in America'sbreadbasket. In fact,
people from
the great state MATT
of Nebraska SPELICH
participate in
an inter-state On Women's
competition Basetball
every year in
which contestants separate the
wheat from the chaff by separat-
ing the cobs from the stalks.
While the contemporary
Huskers play only for pride, they
are vigilant not to forget the
spirit of corn husking- a physi-
cal activity to distract them from
remembering that they are stuck
in Nebraska. Nebraska is new
to the Big Ten this year and has
taken the conference by storm.
Its women's basketball team
has clawed its way to third in
the conference and 13th in the
country, thanks to the dynamic
scoring powers of junior guard
Lindsay Moore and sophomore
forward Jordan Hooper.
You, dear reader, are probably
asking yourself whya sports arti-
cle that has nothing to do with
corn or how it's picked wouldput
so much emphasis on the history
of corn husking in the first three
paragraphs. If this thought has
truly crossed your mind, you
obviously have no appreciation
for mindless games with the sole
purpose of punctuating long
stints of tedious physical labor.
You are probably a student at the
University of Michigan, and so,
despite your lack of appreciation,
I will connect the pieces for you.
Corn husking is more than
what it seems. It is a way of life.
Granted, not all of Nebraska is
stuck in the Stone Age, but the

land is just as flat and boundless
as it was before mechanized trac-
tors and pickers. It is that flatness
that can drive a person to strange
ends, so strange thatthey spend
years of their life bouncing a ball
and shooting it into a hoop over
and over again until their fingers
bleed. It is that kind of oddness
that drives them into the gyms
instead of into the streets so that
they can get their mind off of
their breadbasket existence for a
short while.
The point is simply thus:
whether it's corn-husking, ball-
bouncing or cow-tipping, the
Nebraskan is ruthless, for they
know no other way to be. The
Michigan women's basketball
team has a game scheduled in the
Cornhusker State on Thursday,
and only the Lord knows if they
will make it out alive, let alone
with the win.
An intelligent warrior knows
to fear those with nothing to lose,
and therefore all who travel to
Lincoln mustbe weary. However,
for the Wolverines, who are fresh
off a loss to Michigan State last
Sunday and are clinging desper-
atelv to the sixth spot in the con-
ference, perhaps they may have
less to lose than eventhe Corn-
huskers, which is a disconcerting
notion to any and all Lincolnites.
I wish to leave you with this
amusing antecdote before Thurs-
day's game, because I feel it is the
only justifiable way to end this
travesty of dog-day journalism -
Cornhusker is a funny word for
those on the outs. A colleague of
mine once asked why Nebraskans
say husking and not shucking -
which is simply another way to
describe the removal of the hard
outer layer of a corn ear. Though
I've since learned that it's con-
sidered a sin to use the word
"shuck" in the state of Nebraska,
my answer to his question was
far simpler - who would want
to be called the "Shuckers?" It
sounds like someone with low
self-esteem and a speech impedi-
ment.

sinking shots.
The Wolverines also had trou-
ble penetrating inside, failing to
score a single point in the paint
in the first half.
Beilein must have had a con-
versation about that in the locker
room at halftime, as sophomore
forward Jordan Morgan got a
couple of looks underneath early
in the second frame. He finished
with eight points after going
scoreless in the first half in Lin-
coln.
"We just wanted to get two
feet in the paint, not settle for
shots," Morgan said. "When we
execute and get early, easy bas-
kets, we're tough to guard."
Sophomore guard Tim Hard-
away Jr. has struggled recently,
coming into Wednesday night's
matchup shooting a dismal 21 per-
cent from 3-point range. And he
didn't help his average against the
Cornhuskers, going 0-for-7 from
the field in the first half, including

0-for-5 from long range.
He didn't register his first
bucket until the 16:55 mark in the-
second half - a finger roll after
finding an open lane to the bas-
ket.
He wound up with six points,
none of which came on 3-point-
ers.
"I felt bad after the Michigan
State game, and I don't want to
hurt my teammates in any way,"
Hardaway Jr. said. "This is Zack,
Stu (Douglass) and Corey Per-
son's last season. Just think-
ing about that, you just want to
give it all you got the rest of the
season ... just make a concerted
effort to do the little things like
rebound, take charges and play
great defense."
Added Novak: "We're trying
to get our guy going - we all got
a ton of faith in him.
"The longer this little slump
goes, we just know that at the
end of the year he's going to

make up for it."
Junior guard Matt Vogrich, on
the other hand, was able to snap
out of his recent shooting funk,
knocking down three-straight
triples late in the game to ice the
contest. It was the first time he's
registered a 3-point bucket since
the Wolverines beat Northwest-
ern on Jan. 11.
Vogrich played a big role in
the second-half turnaround -
the team was a lights-out 76 per-
cent from'the field in the half.
Despite Nebraska's obvious
shooting struggles, some credit
has to be given to the Michigan
defense, which allowed the few-
est points since allowing just 41
to Wisconsin at Crisler Center
on Jan. 8.
"It was really big," Novak
said. "We really didn't want to
let any offensive woes dictate
what we were doing on defense,
and I was proud that we didn't
do that today."

Wolverines welcome hometown Winter Classic

Event organizers
hope to shatter
attendance record
By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
With the National Hockey
League scheduled to make
a "major announcement" in
Detroit on Thursday, members

of the Michigan hockey team
reacted with enthusiasm to the
news that the Winter Classic is
expected to be held in Ann Arbor
next January.
Fifth-year senior goalie Shawn
Hunwick grew up a fan of the
Detroit Red Wings, who are
expected to face the Toronto
Maple Leafs in the New Year's
Day affair.
And the Winter Classic is an
event that he's quite familiar

with - in 2010 he went to Fen-
way Park, home of the Boston
Red Sox to watch his brother
Matt skate for the Boston Bru-
ins.
"It was pretty much the best
sporting event I've ever been
to," Hunwick said. "We had
tickets on the (Green) Monster."
So it shouldn't come as a sur-
prise that his face brightened
when asked about the outdoor
game.
"It's just really cool, especial-
ly when it's around New Year's
Eve," Hunwick said. "Around
that time, the city's buzzing."
Yesterday, the University's
Board of Regents voted to
approve the lease of Michigan
Stadium to the NHL for a sum
of $3 million.
Though the game is slated
to be played over winter break,
Athletic Director Dave Bran-
don anticipates no problem
filling seats, especially consid-
ering how many Maple Leafs
fans will likely make the trek
across the border. Ann Arbor is
roughly a five-hour drive from
Toronto, and the Maple Leafs
are known to have an interna-
tional presence.
The Wolverines knocked off
Michigan State at The Big Chill
at the Big House in 2010 in a
game that drew 104,073 fans.
Brandon said on Wednesday
that he's "hell-bent" on ensur-
ing the Winter Classic shatters
the mark set in that game.
Though Hunwick has played
in his fair share of outdoor
games, the appeal of playing
and watching outdoor games is
still as strong as ever.
"Every city wants to host,"
Hunwick said. "I think you
should be able to fill up stadi-
ums, especially baseball stadi-
ums. It's really a cool event."
Sophomore forward Luke
Moffatt didn't have to think
twice when asked if he would
attend a Winter Classic in Ann
Arbor.
"Absolutely."
Moffatt acknowledges that

The flexibility
o f surnames

fashion design into
their own hands
By CHLOE STACHOWIAK
Daily Music Editor
Take one step into Emily Pit-
tinos's East Quad dorm room and
it's immediately apparent you're
stepping into a space used for more
than study and sleep.
Trash bags packed with fluffy
wool are crammed beneath the
bed. Jars of fabric dye line the sink.
Handmade headbands dangle bril-
liantly from a reading lamp. It may
not be a layout worthy of an HGTV
special, but for Pittinos, it doesn't
need to be: Ever since she started
making yarn, her bedroom doubles
as a makeshift yarn workshop, a
place where raw materials stand
beside twin beds and spinning
supplies outnumber textbooks.
Pittinos's habitations haven't
always been clogged up with spin-
ning wheels and fibers, though.
Working with yarn is an art form
she has only known for a year -
even if the tools and fantastically
colored products piled on her floor
suggest otherwise.
"It's all super new to me," she
said. "I have a friend who I met in
high school who lives in Maine.
They have their own sheep farm,
and when I went there in the sum-
mer, his mom taught me how to
spin in a couple hours. I ended up
doing that the entire time I was
there, and when I got home, I
bought my own spinning wheel."
It didn't take long for her craft
to grow into something bigger, as
the Arts and Ideas major designed
her own fiber-focused independent
study through the RC. From there,
she taught herself to spin, dye and
blend wool - dorm-room style.
"I had to create my own method
for dyeing," she said. "Usually, you
have to boil the water, but I can't
really do that."
This method involved glass
jars, an electric heater and a tiny
sink. It may be unconventional,
but that's exactly what sets her
apart from the rest of the crafting
pack. Twisting the materials into
jars allows Pittinos to put her own
spin on every product she creates,
resulting in rich hues and eclectic
designs typically unseen in the

ALLISON KRUSKE/Daily
Student designer Ryan Perkins found his sewing machine on the side of the road.

fiber fairs and Etsy.com networks
she frequents.
It's hard to say exactly where
Pittinos's woolen art will take her
next, but with handmade purs-
es and the Ann Arbor Art Fair
already on her mind, it's clear that
she isn't short on ideas.
Pittinos isn't the only student
balancing university life with
design. Ryan Perkins, an Engi-
neering senior and creator of the
clothing line R. Perkins MFG, is
also finding time to pursue his
fashion interests - all while main-
taining a student's schedule.
The hectic workload began two
years ago, when Perkins taught
himself to sew, starting with a
leather backpack and later grad-
uating to jeans. While his first
machine was outdated (he found it
discarded on the side of the road)
and not actually designed to with-
stand the thickness of denim, Per-
kins gave his find a chance and still
uses it to sew his products.
"This is one of the best and
strongest home sewing machines
you can find," he said. "Everything
else is geared toward old ladies
making finger puppets."
One year later, R: Perkins MFG
was born - a brand complete with
a website and list of goods and ser-
vices including pants, scarves and
free men's haircuts for his bravest
customers. The line's highlight,
however, is its custom-made jeans
- a passion that started when
Perkins grew tired of paying too

much money for designer denim,
he wasn't entirely happy with.
"I kind of use other designers as
inspiration, or 'uninspiration,' if
that makes sense," he said. "A lot
of brands use different embellish-
ments and colored threads ... I like
to keep it as simple as possible."
But this minimalistic style
isn't executed simply. One pair
of jeans takes Perkins at least 15
hours to make, a feat tackled with
handmade patterns and vintage
equipment in his Broadway Street
apartment. The intricate process
limits his production to one pair a
week, but ensures customers (who
pay in cash, paintings or beer) a
quality of material and craftsman-
ship they can't find in stores.
Because of his rigorous class
schedule and interest in engineer-
ing-related jobs, Perkins plans on
maintaining R. Perkins MFG as
a side project for now. But with
steady business on his website and
possible deals with local vendors,
there's no telling when the proj-
ect will transform into something
more.
From self-taught sewing to jam
jars bloated with yarn and dye,
little about the artistic process is
black and white for student design-
ers Pittinos and Perkins. Their
secret isn't following the rules, but
redefining them: It's about setting
down textbooks, grabbing their
work by the needle and turning
each stitch and splash of color into
something more personal.

ince the day of my birth,
I have been both blessed
and burdened with the
inheritance of a hyphenated last
name. The 16 characters don't

sign-in sheets,
they definitely.
don't make
the cut for
the standard-
ized testing
box, and they JULIA
comprise one SMITH-
hell of an EPPSTEINER
unappealing
signature.
But perhaps a hyphenated name
is memorable, like sharing in
the Additional section of your
resume that you bear the skill of
reciting the entirety of Christo-
pher Walken's gold watch "Pulp
Fiction" monologue. Mom and
dad, I love you up to the sky and,
down again, but what were you
thinking? Did you hypothesize
what might come of my kids'
comically never-ending names?
For my mama, choosing to
keep her maiden name Smith and
not take my dad's name was more
practical than anything else. As
a lawyer, she had already made a
name for herself, established an
identity in the workplace and all
aspects of life. It wasn't a par-
ticularly feminist or ethics-based
decision, and it wasn't just the
avoidance of the paperwork that
comes with getting new credit
cards and all of that not-fun
business. Hyphenating her name
with my dad's just made sense,
but for others, it's a forceful and
moralized decision involving
issues such as women's equality,
religion and tradition.
For Kim Kardashian, on the
other hand, plans were in place"
to follow the customary path and
become Mrs. Kim Humphries,
despite manager-mother Kris
Jenner's resolute advice not to.
The reasoning was that Kim's
fame, identity and career are
all intimately attached to her
last name. Thankfully for Kim,
she hadn't yet gotten around to
legally switching her name in
the - don't hold your breath - 72
days they were married.

The trend of brides opting to
keep their maiden names and
hyphenate their children's last
names with their husband's is
possibly a fashion of the '90s, but
one that is possibly still continu-
ing - it's difficult to decipher.
But it's one with interesting
ramifications that are finally ris-
ing to the surface. Not for myself,
I must specify.
Stuff White People Like, aka
Christian Lander, addressed the
inclination toward hyphenated
last names, describing it as "a
direct result of white women
thinking it's sexist and outdated
to take on their husband's name."
Theorizing about the prospects
of this "recent phenomenon,"
Lander "(has) a feeling that col-
lege lacrosse and soccer jerseys
are going to look pretty strange
in the next few years."
Why limit
the many
possibilities of
last names?
The situation isn't as dramatic
or problematic as I've been mak-
ing it out to be, because there
truly are alot of options. And it
seems that most people who were
given hyphenated last names
were not raised in traditional
families with traditional values
and would probably be open to
progressive alternatives such as
using one's middle name as their
last name for their children's
surname. To clarify, let's imagine
a very distant scenario - I; Julia
Alix Smith-Eppsteiner, marry
phantom spouse John Doe. This
would mean that our hypotheti-
cal kids would be named Emma
Alix-Doe and Alexander Alix-
Doe, for example.
In the past week, I've gotten
a sense for students' opinions on
the subject from a wide range of
personalities and majors across
the University's campus, includ-
ing those of my classmates. My

As 3 a.m. approaches, the dim
street glows with the fluorescent
spotlight under which LSA junior
Dana Pennington waits. Ankles
aching and arms straining to fend
off the invasive winter air, she lis-
tens for the next call.
"All right, for this next take, just
smile, laugh, jump around - have
fun with it," the director says.
Ignoring the blistering pain of
too-tight heels, Pennington nods
to the surrounding crew. A music-
video shoot tonight and a Sociol-
ogy exam tomorrow morning - as
a full-time student and part-time
model, it's all just a part of life.
Facebook may be the hot spot
for folders of your roommate's
best angles and that freshly photo-
shopped profile pic, but for many
students on campus, looking good
means more than 14 "likes" - it's a
career.
"You're getting judged on exact-
ly how you look ... most people feel
that way on a daily basis, but (as
a model), that's your career. The
way you look is how you make your
money," Pennington said.
With the opportunity to walk
the runways of local designers and
slither into extreme makeup and
atypical fashion (cardboard and
paper gowns, anyone?), many stu-
dents turn to SHEI Magazine to
dip their manicured toes into the
modeling industry. As the Univer-

sity's student-run fashion maga-
zine, SHEI offers models a peek
into the profession. For Business
junior Cynthia Zhang, who has
worked as a model since the age
of 16, her four years at SHEI have
blossomed into bookings with
fashion chains such as Macy's,
Neiman Marcus, Rag & Bone and
Saks Fifth Avenue.
SHEI welcomes students of all
backgrounds and serves as the
medium through which first-timers
like Art & Design sophomore Grace
Treado gain exposure to the surreal
world in front of the camera lens.
"Someone told me to go to the
SHEI model call, just on a whim
in between classes," Treado said.
"They just called me back ... and
they were like, 'We want you to
do a shoot, and next week we have
a fashion show coming up and we
need extra people.' "
The publication is a celebra-
tion of fashion in which aspiring
writers, photographers and styl-
ists express their passion for the
industry through an annual issue.
SHEI employs models for events
and student-conceptualized photo
shoots, as well as providing oppor-
tunities with local designers. In
Pennington's case, it got her a gig
in a music video for Ann Arbor-
based band The Hop's single "Hi
Tonight."
Weekends consumed by spend-
ing hours sunk into a make-up
chair, stylists molding a model
into an unrecognizable version
of herself, ten minutes of the con-
stant shutter of a photographer's
camera - a tedious, repetitive
process is involved in creating the
glamorous illusion. When asked
about the dedication required for

the "sporadic" career, each model
bemoaned the growing time con-
flicts, which interfere with her sec-
ond life as a student.
"Before I do any modeling things,
I make sure I get my schoolwork
done," Zhang said. "And if I have to
choose between the two, I definitely
go with school. That's what a stu-
dent's supposed to do, right?"
Despite the tiring conditions,
Zhang revels in the ability to evolve
in front of the lens, pioneering the
extreme designs in which fash-
ion transcends the racks of local
boutiques and_ solidifies as art. For
Zhang and Pennington, the runway
is a stage and the model is the per-
former and the audience, enthralled
by the very act in which she takes
part.
"It's your moment on stage,"
Zhang said.
"I am (scared by it), but that's the
reason I like it ... Knowing there are
so many people that I'm directly.
putting the show on for, it's really
exciting," Pennington added.
As a model and photographer,
Treado appreciates, the creative
and technical aspects of posing for
the camera. Describing fashion as
one of many creative outlets, she
expressed surprise at the respect
she has gained for modeling as an
alternative form of art.
"It proved every expectation I
had about modeling to be wrong,"
Treado said. "I thought if I started
(modeling with) SHEI, I'd dress in
a couple of pretty outfits, like maybe
my face will show up in a magazine
and that'll be it. But this was all
edgy and conceptual and weird."
Whether it be trekking a car-
peted runway in 7-inch Louboutins
or rushing through the next outfit-

change of a hectic show backstage,
models not only suffer for their art,
they suffer for the art of others -
designers, photographers and styl-
ists. For Zhang, Pennington and

Treado, models work to represent
a collective vision. As described by
Treado, artists embrace a multi-
tude of creative outlets, but "fash-
ion is just a different one."


THIN RED LINE
From Page 6B
World War II film, "The Thin Red
Line." He saw his film, a dramati-
zation-of the Battle of Guadalca-
nal, as a look into the unspoiled
Eden of the Pacific island invad-
ed by the "green poison" of war.
Instead of honoring the dead
and the dying who struggled to
keep the world free, Malick gave
us birds twisting in agony as the
pristine forests of Guadalcanal get
shredded apart by artillery.
It's beautifully shot and there's

no denying that Malick has an eye
for composition, but it's utterly
unmoving, especially when framed
against perhaps the greatest con-
flict the world has ever known.
With a degree in philosophy, it's
surprising that Malick failed to
realize material things can always
be replaced - come peacetime, the
island will slowly restore itself. It's
the hunan element of war - the
millions of young soldiers who laid
their lives on the line in the Pacific
theater - that is truly irreplace-
able.
And when he tries to deal with
these human characters, Malick
is, unsurprisingly, inept. The

film's central character - a man
who deserts his unit in favor of
the simpler life of an island native
- is impossible to relate with. His
internal musings are cloying, and
though they're obviously meant as
the words of a jaded man tired of
fighting, they come off instead as
a veneer of meaningless posturing
that cloaks his internal cowardice.
"What's this war in the heart of
nature?" he asks. "Why does nature
vie with itself? The land contend
with the sea? Is there an avenging
power in nature?"
Snore. His companions are no
better. There's a soldier who kills
an enemy and muses that nobody

can touch him for killing that man
and committing murder. No shit,
Sherlock - this is war. Another
soldier, whose words end the
movie, ask questions that are even
more insipid: "Where is it that we
were together? Who were you that
I lived with? The brother. The
friend."
Through his pretension, Malick
manages to suck all the power and,
for that matter, all the dramatic
tension from one of the clearest
examples of good versus evil in
recorded history. Who says phi-
losophy majors don't contribute to
society?

Students blogging
the latest trends


around campus
By KELLY ETZ
Daily TV/New Media Editor
For students with lectures,
exams, papers and a host of other
time-sucking activities, where
should fashion rate on the impor-
tance scale? Should personal
appearance be an issue worth wor-
rying about?
According to LSA sophomore
Stefanie Rubinstein and Business
sophomore Zoe Baris, the way you
present yourself may be just as
essential as your other qualifica-
tions when it's time for that all-
important interview or the first day
of a brand new internship. It can
even be a factor in how professors
consider in determining a student's
credibility - not anything to scoff
over when the time comes to ask for
a letter of recommendation.
"You are your personal brand,"
Baris said. "So, what you wear to an
interview, what you wear to class,
even what you wear out to a quick
lunch or something, you are seen
and that is how people perceive
you."
"I don't want to raise my hand
in a class if I feel like I look like a
schlup," Rubinstein added. "You
want to project yourself as a good
image."
Rubinstein and Baris teamed
up this past summer to produce
their own fashion blog, The Chic
Classmate. Filled with clever 'tips
- winterwear under 50 dollars,

curiosity on the topic of last-
name options was in fact spurred
during a discussion in my English
course that looks at "Love, Mar-
riage, and the Rise of the Novel"
in the 17th and 18th centuries.
I heard a variety of responses,
from "I want my wife to have my
last name, I insist upon it. I'm a
believer in traditional stuff" and
"I want to honor my husband,
he's the old-fashion type, you
know?" to opinions such as "if my
wife had a cool-ass last name, I'd

must-have accessories, the chicest
backpacks - and photographic
inspiration from the runways to the
Diag, the blog takes an inside look
at the street style here on campus.
"When average people put them-
selves together, it's not like they
have a stylist," Rubinstein said.
"They are going on their own to
put together something amazing
and they aren't even thinking about
the fact that people are looking at
them."
Recently reaching its 100th
post, The Chic Classmate covers all
things broadly defined as "stylish,"
- including posts on haute cou-
ture designers such as Chanel or
Versace - while also trimming the
focus to view fashion through the
lens of the average college student.
In their Model Student posts, they
highlight "ordinary students who
are doing extraordinary things
around campus."
Another student blogger, LSA
junior Nikki Williams, is the Uni-
versity of Michigan correspon-
dent for the website Hercampus.
com. Her Campus is tailored spe-
cifically to college-age women and
has specific sites for over 100 col-
lege campuses across the United
States. Each individual campus site
is a primarily student-run venture,
allowing the student correspon-
dents to get an in-depth feel for
what the online magazine industry
is all about.
The Michigan site is structured
simply - it lets the content do the
talking and is chock-full of Ann
Arbor-inspired goodness. Williams
contributes with her own fashion
blog, taking an insider look at the
up-to-the-minute trends - all-
take hers," to a female speaking
about hyphenation as a symbol of
a merging of heritages.
A friend of mine made me aware
that some people are, as of late,
opting to combine names to create
something fantastically fresh. This
would look like Phillip Glass and
Lucinda Childs getting married
(Yes, I'm still stuck in "Einstein
On The Beach" mode) and their
children's last name being some-
thing awful sounding like Chlass
or Glilds.
Though these trendy alterna-
tives may clash against tradition
in the eyes of about 70 percent of
Americans, opinions like "it's kind
of just what happens" in reference

white, sailor stripes, '70s-inspired
- breaking out on campus and edu-
cating the site's visitors on how to
fill their closets, rock the latest bur-
geoning craze or start one of their
own.
"For my personal fashion blog, I
just write about what I like," Wil-
liams said. "My blog today actu-
ally ran about fur trends and how
to wear fur in a classy way. So, a
lot of it is just what I'm seeing as
a trend."
These blogs are a means for Uni-
versity students to exercise their
ingenuity abit and work outside the
oft-rigid guidelines of their own
particular avenues of study, which
include economics, business and
communications.
"This is something that - sur-
prisingly for me, because I didn't
expect this - has become a prior-
ity," Rubinstein said. "I love that
this is a way we can stillbe involved
with fashion and things that are
creative because you don't always
get that opportunity."
College students go through
many ofthe same fashion struggles,
a necessary evil when students are
suddenly faced with the real world.
Blogs like The Chic Classmate and
Her Campus keep fashion and per-
sonal style from becoming another
burden to add to an ever-growing
list.
The goals of these ventures are
to provide a place for University
students - those behind the scenes
and in front of the screens - to find
the time to actually enjoy them-
selves: to share the personal with
the public and to take a moment
from a busy schedule to revel in the
creative.

name in marriage feel a smidgen
complacent and unconsidered for
my peace of mind. I have no clue
what the trend of last names will
be a decade from now or what I'm
going to do when and if I get mar-
ried, but an altering of identity
should never bea kind of assumed
notion, nor should anything in life
be. Summer sunbathingcomes and
goes, love comes and goes, trends
come and go - soI say let's listen
to the words of the old scholar and
"question everything."

Like in the salons of 77th
and 78th century France,
this weekly installment
will feature two Daily Arts
writers discussing the finer
points of arts mediums
from at least 70 years ago.
Any defense of a Terrence
Malick film must inevitably
respond to attacks on the direc-
tor's style - many of which are
superfluous. His films - like
Spielberg's, Scorsese's and even
Cameron's - are big, themati-
cally and stylistically. They're
concerned with broad ideas and
painted with broad strokes.
I hear "pretentious," "conde-
scending" and "aimless" all lobbed
at Malick as insults (all of which,
nowadays, seem to ring as compli-
ments), but I can hardly see how his
films, as accessible and univ4l as
they are, could ever be considered
exclusivist. To say the films are
unconcerned with character, nar-
rative and cohesion is to acknowl-
edge their strongest assets. There
are few directors working in the
American commercial mainstream
(aside from maybe David Lynch)
whose work so effortlessly evokes
the cosmic.
In this regard, I value his films
for the same reasons I'm drawn to
dislike them. To watch them with
an open mind is to submit oneself
to a wholesale rejection of irony -
an embrace of fairly traditional,
conventional representations of
-beauty. The poetic presentation of
nature stands as a radical tonic to
pretension. Malick's treatment of
the natural world doesn't seek to
inundate us with crafty juxtapo-
sitions or contrivance. They are
independent of artifice and full of
it. He edits reels and reels of foot-
age into a world merely inhabited
by his actors. His films are babies
of the editing room and yet seem
to live outside the screen as whole
worlds unto themselves.
Malick's action film, "The Thin
Red Line," is (next to "Badlands")
easily his most accessible and
engaging. It deserves merit as few

war films do for valorizing noth-
ing and nobody. It presents visceral
combat in two taut, seismic swells
- climbing the hills of Guadalca-
nal, decimating the landscape and
soldiers both.
It's hard to deny the sensual-
ity of Malick's films - even when
"sex" itself appearstobe something
feared and treasured rather than
enjoyed. We're free to ignore the
spoken overtones barely keeping
the film from collapse. "Line" asks
us to submit to its totality, and if we
allow it, it transports. The whistle
and crash of artillery, sweating
foreheads, stenches of rotting flesh,
sunlight sweeping out from clouds
as soldiers meet their doom - these
are the accoutrements of an utter
compositional marvel.
And of course, Malick's duali-
ties are obvious. Conflicts are laid
out plainly. And when it comes
to Malick's best work, of which
"The Thin Red Line" can safely
be included, that conflict seems to
exist, all too tragically, in the jaded
construction of our own flimsy, aes-
thetic vainglory.
-JOE DIMUZIO
Hollywood is full of would-be
"auteurs" trying to deliver pro-
found messages that end up seem-
ing trite and heavy-handed. None
are more infuriating, however, than
Terrence Malick, Hollywood's res-
ident Mr. "I studied philosophy at
Harvard, so I'm smarter than you."
His recent Oscar-nominated film,
"The Tree of Life," is particularly
infuriating - Sean Penn's adult
character is deeply impacted by
childhood scars inflicted by his
daddy, Brad Pitt, but his mother
was nice and somehow this all
ties into Creation and the Bible. It
features empty, flowerly voiceover
about "the way of nature and the
way of grace," randomly intercut
with what looks like a nature docu-
mentary.
Critics and the Academy alike
rave about how it's ingenious
and different, but it's not. It's
the same vapid, pretentious crap
that Malick has spoon-fed us for
decades. In 1998, for example,
Malick gave us his attempt at a

Avtomobile is one of the several thrift stores in Arm Arbor.

Ann Yurko, a volunteer at the store,
explained several times, "We're the
best-kept secret in Ann Arbor!"
Upon first glance, the store
seems understocked and unprom-_
ising, but hidden among the fair
share of unmemorable articles
are some remarkable finds, such
as flashy '80s sweaters, dizzying
arrays of flowery button-ups and
thick-heel pumps in every color.
Since St. Vincent is a charitable
business, it accepts everything

and trashes nothing, resulting in
sometimes freaky commodities.
Gail Hallman, the jewelry counter
volunteer, recalled a giant crucifix
someone donated that was made
out of mystery bones. "We never
found out if they were human bones
or not, but we did end up selling it,"
Hallman said. "It was very creepy."
Thrifters looking for a bone-
free shopping experience may
want to head over to Avtomobile,
a newer store on East Liberty.
Shopping at Avtomobile is kind of
cheating when it comes to buying
used clothes - most of the clothes
are re-creations made from vin-
tage fabrics and materials, and
some items are brand-new and
fresh off the printing press. But
you don't have to worry too much
about originality - there aren't a
ton of duplicates, and all the prints
are the creations of artist Maris
Turner, who owns the store with
Sara Renner.
Avtomobile has a discrete home
in a cozy basement, with exposed
rock walls and a faint smell of burn-
ing firewood that complements the
clothing's outdoorsy "Up North"
theme. The store has an unprece-
dented sense of character, each item
evoking strong Americana pride,
and more specifically, an affinity for
all things Michigan-related. There's
even a section dedicated to authen-
tic vintage University apparel, con-
taining years of Wolverine pride

you won't be able to buy at The M
Den.
But Avtomobile is a well-trav-
eled shop. You can find vintage
tees that come from a variety of
locations such as Houston, Iowa
and - oh dear - East Lansing.
Traveling is a necessity for Turner
and Renner.
"We're closed Monday and Tues-
day," Turner said. "So we'll drive
around and take road trips to some
weird antique stores - sometimes
tourist trap areas and sometimes
even Salvation Armies, but we try
not to go there as much."
"We're very picky with our fab-
rics," Renner added.
Avtomobile's stock is diverse,
including,. jackets with colorful
Native American prints and an
assertively feminine collection of
polka-dotted silky blouses destined
to be worn with a poodle skirt.
Probably the most unforgettable
item at Avtomobile is a small series
of black sweatshirts with nothing
but "DEATH" printed on the front.
Looking ahead to the sum-
mer season, however, Avtomo-
bile plans to roll out less morbid
designs in the future.
"I design whenever I'm
inspired," Turner said. "I try to
be consistent with the seasons -
we'll be doing stuff that's more
spring-related, more happy, more
upbeat. ... But we don't want to
force anything."

All of the prints sold at Avtomobile are designed by co-owner Maris Turner.
