Dean, professors
will influence policy
via Institute
of Medicine
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
Last week, three University
faculty members were inducted
into the Institute of Medicine,
a health branch of the National
Academy of Sciences that aids
lawmakers and businesses with
health policy by collaborating
with the best of the best in the
medical and research fields.
Oncology Prof. Eric Fearon,
chief of molecular medicine and
genetics; Public Health Prof.
Arline Geronimus and Medical
School Dean Dr. James Woollis-
croft were officially elected to the
IOM, the University of Michigan
Health System announced Mon-
day.
As inductees, they will work on
and presint research with more

than 2,000 members who volun-
teer their time and knowledge
annually for issues that impact
the public. With the addition
of the three faculty members,
UMHS now has 53 faculty who
are past and present members of
the IOM.
Woolliscroft called the recog-
nition an honor, noting that the
induction was a tribute to his
mentors as well.
"Success is built on what peo-
ple are willing to invest in you
over the course of your career," he
said. "Now I see this as an oppor-
tunity to invest myself in others
as people have done for me."
He added that he sees this as
a responsibility of his profession,
and that he enjoys teaching peo-
ple through both academia and
medicine.
"That's simply how I look at
what-we do in academic medi-
cine," he said. "You take care of
the patient in front ofyou through
your clinical work, and you take
care of the patients of the future
through education and research."

Finance reports
show expensive
race in Ward 2


Data shows a total
of $53K raised in all
city council races
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Candidates' campaign finance
data is in for the most recent
reporting period for the Ann
Arbor City Council elections
with combined funds for all the
candidates reaching upward of
$53,000.
Topping the list was Jane
Lumm (Ward 2-I) with $20,875-
which exceeds the $18,950 pre-
election total Lumm generated in
the 2011 election - raised for this
last filing period, which ended on
Oct. 20. Lumm's funds are about
double that of Kirk Westphal,
Lumm's Democratic challenger
in Ward 2.
Money raised for Ann Arbor
City Council elections through
October 20, 2013.
LSA senior Conrad Brown, a
third Ward 2 candidate, filed a
reporting waiver, which means

he expects to collect less than
$1,000. Brown is an indepen-
dent candidate, running with the
Mixed Use Party.
Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1) will
face-off against new candidate
Jeff Hayner, an independent, for
the Ward 1 seat. Briere collected
$11,800 while Hayner collected
about $2,700.
Hayner said the difference
in funds is likely a disadvantage
for him, but he's still been able
to reach voters and create inter-
est in his campaign. Hayner said
Briere has been able to utilize her
additional resources for mailings,
while he has had to do more work
door-to-door soliciting, which
makes it harder to inform a large
amount of people.
"Instead of using $1,800-
worth of postage, I'm taking a day
and having all the neighbors give
their neighbors a note by hand,"
Hayner said. "I'm running a zero-
balance campaign; I'm not going
to have any debt when I'm done."
He also noted that informing
reaching voters is hard enough
even with mailings, noting the

Cousin admitted fatally
stabbing mom, four kids

Syria files weapons report
amid renewed violence

Suspect still in
custody after
resisting arrest and
assaulting officer
NEW YORK(AP) - A Chinese
immigrant who neighbors said
struggled to survive in America
was arrested Sunday on five
counts of murder in the stabbing
deaths of his cousin's wife and
her four children in their Brook-
lyn home - using a butcher knife.
The suspect, 25-year-old Min-
gdong Chen, implicated himself
in the killings late Saturday in
the Sunset Park neighborhood,
police said.
"They were cut and butchered
with a kitchen knife," said Chief
of Department Philip Banks III.
Two girls, 9-year-old Linda
Zhuo and 7-year-old Amy Zhuo,
were pronounced dead at the
scene, along with the youngest

child, 1-year-old William Zhuo
- all attacked in a back bedroom,
policesaid. Their brother, 5-year-
old Kevin Zhuo, and 37-year-old
mother, Qiao Zhen Li, were taken
to hospitals, where they were
also pronounced dead.
Chen is a cousin of the chil-
dren's father and had been stay-
ing at the home for the past week
or so, Banks said.
Chen came to the United
States from China in 2004, the
chief said, but neighbors say he
could never hold down a job.
"He made a very soft comment
that since he came to this coun-
try, everybody seems to be doing
better than him," the chief said.
"We're not really sure what that
means."
The chief said Chen still
speaks only Mandarin Chinese
despite being in the U.S. for
almost a decade.
On Saturday night, Chen
apparently had been acting in'a
"suspicious" way that concerned

Li, Banks said. She tried to call
her husband, who wasn't home,
but couldn't reach him.
Banks said Li then called her
mother-in-law in China, who
also was unsuccessful in reach-
ing her son. The mother-in-law
reached out to her daughter in
the same Brooklyn neighbor-
hood, Banks said.
She and her husband came
to the house and banged on the
door. When it opened, they faced
a grisly sight: a man they didn't
know, covered with blood. The
couple called 911, and officers
investigating another matter
nearby responded quickly, Banks
said.
"It's a scene you'll never for-
get," he said. The victims had
wounds in their necks and torsos.
Chen was in custody and not
immediately available to com-
ment; it was not clear whether
he had a lawyer. Banks said he
had at first resisted arrest and,
while being processed, assaulted

a police officer.
Bob Madden, who lives near-
by, was out walking his dog Sat-
urday night when he saw a man
being escorted from the two-
family brick.house by police. He
was barefoot, wearing jeans, and
"he was staring, he was expres-
S7sionless," Madden said.
Yuan Gao, a cousin of the
1 2 mother, came by the house Sun-
day and stood on the street, along
with the neighborhood's mostly
8 7 9 Chinese residents.
Some said that at Chen's latest
5 1 2 temporary home, days before the
brutal killings, late-night argu-
4 7 2ments were loud enough to be
heard outside.
Gao said Chen was emotion-
9ally unstable. "He's crazy," she
said.
1 3 Gao also said Chen kept get-
ting fired from various restau-
I 28 rant jobs after only a few weeks.
Fire department spokesman
Jim Long said emergency work-
4ers responded just before 11
p.m. to a 911 call from a person
stabbed at the residence in Sun-
set Park, a working-class neigh-
borhood.

Chemical weapons
set to be destroyed
by mid-2014 in
'ambitious timeline'
THE HAGUE, Netherlands
(AP) - Syria has filed details of
its poison gas and nerve agent
program and an initial plan to
destroy it to the world's chemical
weapons watchdog, the organi-
zation said Sunday.
The Organization for the Prohi-
bition ofChemical Weapons said in
a statement that Syria completed
its declaration as part of a strict
and ambitious timeline that aims
to eliminate the lethal stockpile by
mid-2014.
Thegroupbased in The Hague,
said Syria made the declaration
Thursday. The announcement pro-
vides "the basis on which plans are
devised for a systematic, total and
verified destruction of declared
chemical weapons and production
facilities," the group said.
Such declarations made to the
organization are confidential. No
details of Syria's program were
released.
Syria already had given pre-
liminary details to the OPCW
when it declared it was joining
the organization in September.
The move warded off possible
U.S. military strikes in the after-
math of an Aug. 21 chemical
weapon attack on a Damascus
suburb. Syria denies responsibil-
ity for the deadly attack.
OPCW inspectors were hast-
ily dispatched to Syria this
month and have visited most of
the 23 sites Damascus declared.
They also have begun overseeing
destruction work to ensure that
machines used to mix chemicals
and fill munitions with poisons
are no longer functioning.
Syria is believed to possess
around 1,000 metric tons of
chemical ,weapons, including
mustard gas and sarin.
It has not yet been decided
how or where destruction of
Syria's chemical weapons will

happen. Damascus' declara-
tion includes a general plan for
destruction that will be consid-
ered by the OPCW's 41-nation
executive council on Nov. 15.
Norway's foreign minis-
ter announced Friday that the
country had turned down a U.S.
request to receive the bulk of
Syria's chemical weapons for
destruction because it doesn't
have the capabilities to complete
the task by the deadlines given.
The announcement came
among renewed fighting in Syria.
Al-Qaida-linked rebels battled
government troops for control
of the Christian town of Sadad
north of Damascus, activists said..
The rebels have been trying to
seize the town for the past week,
and residents in the rebel-held
western neighborhoods of Sadad
are trapped in their homes, said
Rami Abdurrahman of the Brit-
ain-based Syrian Observatory of
Human Rights.
The rebels appear to have
targeted Sadad because of its
strategic location near the main
highway north from Damascus
rather than because it is inhab-
ited primarily by Christians.
But extremists among the reb-
els are hostile to Syria's Chris-
tians minority, which has largely
backed President Bashar Assad
during the conflict.
The official Syrian news agen-
cy said troops wrested back con-
trol of eastern parts of Sadad, but
were clashing in other areas.
Also Sunday, Syrian Kurdish
gunmen were trying to secure
their hold over a major border
crossing with Iraq after captur-
ing the captured the Yaaroubi-
yeh -post in northeast Syria on
Saturday. Abdurrahman said the
Kurdish gunmen were fighting
pockets of fighters from extrem-
ist rebel groups in southern
Yaaroubiyeh.
Syria's chaotic more than 2
1 year-old conflict pits Assad's
forces against a disunited array
of rebel factions. Al-Qaida-
linked hard-liners have fought
.other rebel groups as well as
Kurdish militias who have taken

advantage of the government's
weakness to cement control over
territory dominated by the eth-
nic minority.
The main Western-backed
opposition group, the Syrian
National Coalition, accused Iraqi
forces of fighting moderate Syr-
ian rebels at Yaaroubiyeh, and
shelling the area in cooperation
with Kurdish militants.
Iraq's Interior Ministry
spokesman, Saad Maan Ibrahim,
rejected the accusations, saying
they are "baseless because Iraq
and its security forces have noth-
ing to do with the fighting at the
Syrian border crossing."
In neighboring Lebanon,
another two people -were killed
by sniper fire during fighting
between rival sects in the north-
ern city of Tripoli, the official
state news agency reported. It
said that a soldier in the city also
died Sunday of his wounds.
At least 10 people have been
killed since clashes flared earlier
this week, security officials said.
Syria's. civil war effectively
has spread to Lebanon's sec-
ond largest city, where it has
inflamed tensions between two
impoverished Tripoli neighbor-
hoods-home to Assad opponents
and supporters.
The Bab Tabbaneh district is
largely Sunni Muslim, like Syr-
ia's rebels. The other neighbor-
hood Jabal Mohsen mostly has
residents of Assad's Alawite sect,
an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
The latest round of fighting
began four days ago. Tensions
had been mounting since Oct. 14,
when a Lebanese military pros-
ecutor pressed charges against
seven men, at least one of whom
was from Jabal Mohsen, for their
involvement in twin bombings
near two Sunni mosques in Trip-
olionAug.23thatkilled47people.
Lebanon shares its northern
and eastern border with Syria.
Lebanon's Sunni leadership has
mostly supported the rebels,
while Alawites and Shiites have
backed the Assad government.
Members of all three sects have
gone as fighters to Syria.

Obama faces GOP criticism
over health-reform issues

HHS Secretary
target of tough
questioning on
health law
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Republicans said Sunday they
intend to press Health and
Human Services Secretary
Kathleen Sebeliusonthe Obama
administration's troubled
launch of healthcare.gov, the
online portal to buy insurance;
and concerns about the privacy
of information that applicants
submit under the new system.
The Obama administration
will face intense pressure next
week to be more forthcoming
about how many people have
actually succeeded in enrolling
for coverage in the new insur-
ance markets. Medicare chief
Marilyn Tavenner is to testify
during a House hearing Tues-
day, followed Wednesday by
Sebelius before the House Ener-
gy and Commerce Committee.
The officials will also be grilled
on how such crippling technical
problems could have gone unde-
tected priorto the website's Oct.
1 launch.
"The incompetence in build-
ing this website is staggering,"
said Rep. Marsha Blackburn,
R-Tenn., the second ranking
Republican on the panel and an

opponent of the law.
Democrats said the new sys-
tem needed time to get up and
running, and it could be fixed to
provide millions of people with
affordable insurance. Kentucky
Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat,
said the system was "working in
Kentucky," a state that has dealt
with "some of the worst health
statistics in the country. ... The
only way we're going to get our-
selves out of the ditch is some
transformational tool," like the
new health insurance system.
Blackburn said she wanted
to know much has been spent
on the website, how much more
it will cost to fix the problems,
when everything will be ready
and what people should expect
to see on the site. Blackburn
and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich.,
raised questions of whether the
website could guard the privacy
of applicants.
"The way the system is
designed it is not secure," said
Rogers, who is chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee.
The administration sought
to reassure applicants about
their personal information.
HHS spokeswoman Joanne
Peters said when consumers
fill out their applications, "they
can trust that the information
they're providing is protected
by stringent security standards
and that the technology under-
lying the application process

has been tested and is secure."
The botched rollout has led to
calls on Capitol Hill for a delay
of penalties for those remaining
uninsured. The Obama admin-
istration has said it's willing to
extend the grace period until
Mar. 31, the end of open enroll-
ment. That's an extra six weeks.
The insurance industry says
going beyond that risks under-
mining the new system by giv-
ing younger, healthier people a
pass.
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.
Va., who is seeking a yearlong
delay to the penalty for non-
compliance, said his approach
would "still induce people to get
involved, but it will also give us
the time to transition in. And I
think we need that transition
period to work out the things."
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.;
who has urged the Obama
administration to postpone the
March 31 deadline, said she was
concerned applicants would not
have a full six months to enroll.
The administration was
under no legal requirement to
launch the website Oct. 1. Sebel-
ius, who designated her depart-
ment's Medicare agency to
implement the health care law,
had the discretion to set open
enrollment dates. Officials
could have postponed open
enrollment by a month, or they
could have phased in access to
the website.

New system under
consideration to
increase clarity,
LANSING, Mich. (AP) -
Green is a great school. Red is bad
one. Lime, yellow and orange are
in-between.
Michigan's new color-coded
school accountability system
already could be up for an over-
haul just two months after its
debut. Some lawmakers say.
schools should get A-F grades
just like students do, so parents
and others can easily understand
performance.
"tt's not clear, it's not concise
and it's not transparent. Nobody
knows what a lime green means,
but everybody knows what an
A means," said House Educa-
tion Committee Chairwoman
Lisa Posthumus Lyons, an Alto
Republican who is expected to
start hearings this week on her
soon-to-be introduced legislation
to switch to letter grades.
Letter grades - implemented
in roughly 15 states - seem intui-
tive on their face since schools
are used to evaluating students
with letter grades of their own.
The tricky part is determining
how the rankings are calculated
and making sure they are cred-
ible.
Indeed, Lyons' bills would do
more than change the perfor-
mance scorecard from colors
to letters. She said she wants
to change the formula so that
grades "accurately reflect"
schools' quality.
In the 2012-13 scores released
in August, some schools were
rated red despite being seen as
traditionally high-performing,
while other schools got green
scores despite having no perfor-
mance data because they were
new, according to critics.
Another complaint is that
Michigan's separate top-to-bot-
tom percentile ranking ofschools,
which is part of its accountabil-
ity system under a waiver from
federal no Child Left Behind.
requirements, closely correlates
with student poverty rates. And
others complain that the top-to-

bottom list and separate color
grades are not aligned, confusing
educators and the public.
One goal of the House bills is
to eliminate the top-to-bottom
ranking and replace it with A-F
grades so there is a single system.
That does not mean that designa-
tions such as "reward,""priority"
and "focus" schools would neces-
sarily go away because they are
in the state's waiver to the U.S.
government. But priority schools
in the bottom 5 percent and sub-
ject to state intervention could
be "F" schools. Reward schools
in the top 5 percent could be "A"
schools.
The letter grades would be
based on students'. proficiency
and growth measured through
standardized test scores.
"We're not saying it's letters
are better than colors. We're say-
ing that the thinking that goes
into the creation of the letters
is what has to be replaced," said
Gary Naeyaert, executive direc-
tor of the Great Lakes Education
Project, a school-choice advocacy
group founded by former Repub-
lican gubernatorial candidate
Dick Devos and his wife Betsy
that has given input on the leg-
islation. "There's a lack of buy-
in among the school community
because of the convoluted, ultra
complex, impossible methodolo-
gy of the top-to-bottom ranking,
which now has consequences for
schools."
Naeyaert criticized the state
Education Department's deci-
sion to hold schools accountable
for the achievement gap between
the top- and bottom-scoring stu-
dents instead of measuring the
gap between specific racial or
demographic groups. Education
Department officials declined to
be interviewed for this story.
Education Trust-Midwest, an
education policy and research
organization in Royal Oak, also
supports an A-F system but
says legislators should be care-
ful when revising the "nuts and
bolts" of the accountability sys-
tem. They may be tempted to let
schools off the hook if there is
blowback aboutbeing given a "D"
or "F," said Amber Arellano, the
group's executive director.

Abyei residents vote
on boarder resolution

Voting continues
despite risks, lack of
official support
JUBA, South Sudan (AP) -
Hundreds of people in the disput-
ed border region of Abyei voted
Sunday in a referendum that
they hope will decide whether
they join Sudan or South Sudan,
a local leader said, but the exer-
cise lacked the official backing of
either of the governments.
The exercise was proceed-
ing peacefully Sunday, said Luka
Biong, spokesman for the Abyei
Referendum High Committee, a
civic group that is organizing the
vote. He said the results of the
three-day vote will be announced
on Oct. 31.
"This reminds me of what
happened in January 2011 when
the people of South Sudan voted
for their independence," he said.
"This was a special moment, a
historic moment. This was like
crowningthe history of the strug-
gle of the people of Abyei. I saw
my people so determined."
Both Sudan and South Sudan
claim ownership of the oil-rich

Abyei area, whose status was
unresolved after South Sudan
became independent from its
northern neighbor in 2011.
The region's majority Ngok
Dinka people are believed to be in
favor of joining South Sudan. The
Sudan-allied Misseriya nomads,
who come to Abyei to find pasture
for their cattle, are not participat-
ing in the referendum.
The voting was "going on very
smoothly" across Abyei, con-
firmed Zacharia Deng Majok, a
member of the Abyei Referendum
High Committee.
"People are in a jovial mood
here," he said. "The morale of the
people is very high because they
knowthey are making a choice for
their future."
Up to. 100,000 people are.
expected to participate in the
vote despite warnings that the
event might trigger violence in
the border region. The African-
Union had warned against hold-
ing a referendum, saying such
action could increase the risk of
violence between the Ngok Dinka
and the Misseriya. The Misseriya
have warned that a referendum in
which they are not participants
should not take place.

Lowering tuition, expanding opportunities
Wayne State's new policy will boost student population in Detroit
his past week, Wayne State University in Detroit announced that
it will extend in-state tuition to admitted students from the Great
Lakes states - Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - and Ontario, Canada beginning in Janu-
ary 2014. Wayne State offers in-state tuition to veterans and undocument-
ed students, and the new policy will give the same offer to a wider range
of individuals. Students affected by the policy can now save an average of
$13,000 for 30 credits a year.

The me, myself and Igeneration

Ninety-five percent of the students at Wayne
State are from Michigan, and enrollment has
been steadily decreasing since 2009. The new
tuition policy was implemented in the hope to
attract more students to the university. Wayne
State Provost Margaret Winters told the Detroit
Free Press that the lowered tuition fees may
draw more students to the university "beyond
our normal recruitment area, and become bet-
ter known in other states." Winters also added
that the new policy keep the university com-
petitive: "All our competition has spread their
areas more widely. We needed to remain com-
petitive with them."
In addition to drawing students to Wayne
State, the lowered tuition rates will also draw
more people to the city of Detroit. In the last
several decades, Detroit has been experienc-
ing economic decline and a.rapid decrease in
population. In the last decade alone, population
has decreased by about 25 percent. By entic-
ing more potential students to Wayne State, a
wider range of individuals can gain exposure
to the city. Increasing exposure to the city can
simultaneously increase awareness of Detroit's
thriving culture beyond the common miscon-
ceptions and stereotypes of the Motor City.
As new students live, learn and engage with
Detroit, they can form ties with community
organizations, take part in local internships
and contribute to the city's economy.
Though Wayne State's new tuition policy is
an excellent way to invite more students to the

area, the lack of similar policies nearby may
undermine the university's efforts. A success-
ful program implemented in western states
called the Western Undergraduate Exchange
allows students to apply to more than 140 col-
leges and universities at a reduced tuition rate.
The success of the program lies in the ability to
bring together several institutions, so that they,
all benefitcfrom building an educated workforce
and increasing the diversity of their student
body. Adopting a similar program in the Mid-
west would allow more students to seek afford-
able education outside of their home state, and
would strengthen the program at Wayne State.
Despite the lack of other institutions par-
ticipating in a collective program, Wayne
State's efforts to provide affordable educa-
tion to a wider range of students is nota-
ble. College and university prices across
the country have been steadily increasing.
Here at the University, in-state tuition has
increased about 40 percent since 2004. The
constant rise in tuition prices sends a clear
message: that institutions will maintain a
rigid structure with little regard for stu-
dent's needs. Wayne State is sending us a new
message. With prices constantly increasing
and higher education becoming less acces-
sible, Wayne State is taking the initiative to
solve these pressing issues. Hopefully, more
institutions can follow their example to pro-
vide solutions for the steadily increasing cost
of higher education.

As I was combing through
articles for a column, topic
this week, a Thought Cata-
log post caught
my eye. It was
titled: "Millenni-
als: We Suck. But
It's Okay, Because
We're Going
To Change The
World." Before I
come back to this
article, let me HARSHA
backtrack a little. NAHATA
A lot has been
said about our
generation, most of it not very nice.
We've been called self-absorbed, eas-
ily distracted, entitled, apathetic and
lazy. The cover of Time Magazine
labeled us the "ME ME ME Genera-
tion." After all, we are the generation
of gold stars, short attention spans
and Facebook.
We've been criticized for being
unrealistic about job opportunities
- how dare we be picky in this econ-
omy - and difficult to manage in the
workplace - going back to the whole
"gold star, unable to take criticism,
easily distracted with Ipxods and
texting" thing. In short, we've been
dubbed pretty much the "Worst.
Generation. Ever." - courtesy of
Will McAvoy, the fictional anchor of
HBO's "The Newsroom."
But, thankfully, we have the
Internet to save the day, or at least
tell us what's wrong with us. A Sep-
tember 2013 Huffington Post article
kindly elaborates on "Why Genera-
tionYYuppies are Unhappy." In case
you were wondering, it's because of
our unrealistic expectations, overly
ambitious career goals and the fact
that every elementary school teach-
er we had told us we were special.

Sorry to break it to you: We're not
really all that special.
Basically, we were overly pam-
pered growing up and are now
unprepared for the world - the
really depressing and dysfunctional
world - we have to face. Or so they
say.
Jokes aside, there's some truth
to be found here. We are 'coming of
age' in an increasingly difficult real-
ity. We're the first generation to be
living in a world of approximately
seven billion people. That's bound
to cause some problems. We're
growing up in a world of decreasing
economic opportunity, increasing
income inequality, looming climate
change and numerous bloody con-
flicts. It's not exactly the most opti-
mistic picture. Not to mention the
fact that older generations continue
to put off solving some of today's
most pressing problems, leaving
them for us to deal with down the
road.
And, the fact that we didn't grow
up exactly as our parents did is, in
fact, what will prove to be our great-
est asset.
Yes, we are overly idealistic but in
a world where almost 50 percent of
people live on below the equivalent
of $2.50 a day, don't we have to be?
Yes, we expect more of ourselves
and our jobs - we want to be doing
something we love, not just earning
a living - but it's this passion that'll
inspire us to work hard at what we
do every day. Yes, we were singled
out and propped up on pedestals as
kids, but that also gives us the con-
fidence needed to stand by and push
for the big reforms that many of our
social systems need.
The Thought Catalog post
claimed that our generation, as a

result of how much we are exposed
to, is growing up with a taste of
everything, but not enough in depth
training in anything. And while this
makes us seem easily distracted or
apathetic, it's also forcing us to be
innovative and chart our own paths.
We have fewer traditional pros-
pects, but we have the confidence,
passion and creativity to make new
opportunities - provided, of course,
that we're able to get away from
Facebook long enough to do so. As
the article says, "we might not rein-
vent the wheel" but we're seeking
to reinvent everything since. We're
seeing that certain political, social
and economic systems that have
been in place for years, don't apply
as well to the world we live in. And
because we were told from an early
age that we can do anything we set
our mind to, we're determined to
find ways to change them.
That's not to say that some of
the criticisms aren't valid - we're
not exactly the best-informed gen-
eration. Ironic, given the amount of
access we have to information. With
so many things constantly compet-
ing for our attention, we're con-
stantly forced to decide what is and
isn't important. And, I'll admit, we
haven't been the greatest at doing so.
Buzzfeed articles of adorable yawn-
ing kittens certainly don't help. But if
we are able to find ways to focus our
energy, the very things "Generation
Y" is criticized for can become our
biggest strengths. In fact, that pas-
sion, confidence and ability to remain
idealistic is essential now more than
ever, given the world we will be
inheriting.

An open letter to Sir Walter Wannabe

Dear Sir Walter Raleigh Wannabe,
I came across your piece titled "Why
Chivalry is Dead, From a Man's Per-
spective" last week after it
was shared on myFacebook
newsfeed. I read it once,
twice and then a third time
for good measure, looking
for a hint of satire. When I
didn't find it, I read about
Elite Daily, thinking maybe
the publication is a sort of
offshoot of The Onion. It SARA
isn't. You actually feel this MOROSI
way, and I'm baffled.
In your opening argu-
ment, you mention that you grew up in a tight
knit Italian family, and because of that, feel
you're equipped with a strong set of values. I,
too, grew up in a tight knit Italian family, and
I feel similarly. I can even relate to your ref-
erence of the wooden spoon. But it seems as
though you and I have very different takes on
"why women act the way
they do" - something on
which, according to your
biography, you are quite M ale ch
the expert.
I don't believe chivalry is is still ve
dead. I do believe the way -.
society defines "chivalry" al
has changed with time.
you say that the women
in your life have taught you
"the value of chivalry and etiquette." And, as a
woman, I appreciate that. But the truth is, your
mother and grandmother's experiences with
chivalry reflect the society in which they grew
up and dated - one that left little room for the
empowerment and success of women outside of
the nuclear family, and is very different from
ours. In fact, one of my favorite stories that my
dad tells is about the time, at age 10, he beat up
a boy for saying my grandmother was a terri-
ble mother because she worked outside of the
home as an elementary school teacher.
As women have gained more respect, the
way society regards chivalry has shifted. It's no
longer about a man finding a woman to provide
care for the family while he purses the Ameri-
can Dream. It's about mutual respect.
You say that you're "the only single guy
you know that actually takes a girl out to a
restaurant on a first date." Along with "don't

i
e
.,
1

flatter yourself," I have to say you might want
to reconsider the men with which you sur-
round yourself. I have plenty of friends who
are willing and happy to spend the time and
money to take a girl out on a date. I'm sure
you'd get along great with them.
Then again, maybe you wouldn't. I grew
confused when you proceeded to say: "When
did it become acceptable to just text a girl,
inviting her to come bang? Don't get me
wrong, I'm not complaining about those
instances ..." Correct me if I'm wrong, but
it seems there are times that you dismiss
the traditions you swear by, and conform to
exactly what it is that you are condemning.
You also claim that the death of chivalry has
led to the subsequent end of simple gestures,
like holding doors open. I disagree, as I see this,
among other displays of courtesy on campus,
every day. I do not expect anyone - male or
female - to hold the door open for me, espe-
cially just because I am a woman. I am fully
capable of opening the door myself. But if do
you hold the door open for
me as I scurry into Mason
Hall, I'm going to appre-
auvinism ite it and I'm going to
thank you. I'm also going
:ry much to look over my shoulder
to see if anyone is coming
ye. in behind me before let-
ting the door close. It isn't
about chivalry; it's about
mutual respect.
Your argument that chivalry is dead only
shows that male chauvinism is still very
much alive.,
You state: "The real problem here is that
women, for one reason or another, have
become complacent and allowed men to get
away with adhering to the bare minimum ...
and receiving what we ultimately want any-
way - sex." There is a strong differentiation
between any definition of chivalry and chau-
vinism, and by putting the blame on women
for an imagined epidemic of disrespect, you
are surely displaying the latter.
Since you offered us so much enlighten-
ment, I'd love to return the favor. If you con-
tinue to hold on to said perspective, sir, do not
expect a high return rate on second dates.

Notfar enough

ast week I had the pleasure
of watching "Lee Daniels'
The Butler." The film was
phenomenal,
and I highly rec-
ommend see- .:
ing it. Although
the storyline
revolves around
a butler named
Cecil Gaines-
who works in
the White House PATRICK
for 34 years, the MAILLET
movie ultimately
says more about
the Civil Rights movement. The
movie ends with Gaines - a man
raised on a cotton plantation -
meeting President Barack Obama.
After leaving the theater, I couldn't
help but think about how far Amer-
ica has come when considering this
country's incredibly recent history
with racism and discrimination.
The day after watching the movie,
I had lunch with my friend Morgan,
who was in a noticeably bad mood.
After I asked her what was wrong,
she told me that she had just left a
class in which the discussion was
-whether or not gay marriage is con-
stitutional. As you can imagine at a
university such as Michigan, the vast
majority of the classroom supported
the constitutionality of gay mar-
riage. Interestingly enough, it wasn't
a comment that had caused Morgan's
irritation; it was the fact that this
conversation was even happening
that was so frustrating to her.
Morgan's parents are gay. Even
though she has lived in the "liberal"
city of Ann Arbor her entire life,
Morgan and her family have had to
deal with the universal, constant
adversity that gay parents face. Just
last week during parents' weekend,
Morgan was faced with a challenge.

Woolliscroft also said he's
looking forward to researching
issues pertinent to the nation
and reporting on sub-committees
related to health and safety.
Fearon, whose research is
related to the progression of colon
and rectal cancer, described the
process as intense: members of
the IOM nominate individuals for
consideration, and then a board
takes several months to evaluate
the candidates to determine who
will be elected.
Despite the honor, Fearon said
joining the IOM wasn't a career
* goal.
"It's great to be recognized and
have your group recognized for
their work in science and in medi-
cine, but ultimately your goal is to
help people," Fearon said. "With
anything you just try to do the
best work and the best research
you can and try to make an impact
that way."

$11.1 million of the $14.4 mil-
lion that the University collects
each year from past patents and
licensing agreements is directly
attributable to innovations from
medical research. Licenses were
granted to 54 Medical School
inventions as part of 40 license
agreements with corporate busi-
nesses in the past fiscal year.
Licensing and patents do not
always translate into successful
products,but the Medical School.
has established a new initiative
to aid in the translation from
research lab to marketplace.
Headed by Ward, the Fast
Forward Medical Innova-
tion Initiative aims to combine
research and entrepreneurship
efforts in order to foster com-
mercialization.
Among the initiative's pro-
grams is the implementation of
Innovation Strike Forces, groups

of employees that will identify
and accelerate promising ideas,
then connect the dots between
researchers, clinicians and busi-
nesses.
"The new innovation program
is to help faculty think in different
ways about their ideas and to pro-
vide them with an innovation road
map so that we can get their ideas
to impact through product devel-
opmentmuchearlier,"Wardsaid.
Ward said although ideas are
protected through invention
disclosures and patents, many of
them do not necessarily become
products. To ease the transi-
tion from biomedical research
to clinical application, Ward
plans to work closely with the
Office of Tech Transfer, the Col-
lege of Engineering Center for
Entrepreneurship, the Business
Engagement Center and other
campus offices.
"We've got a top-ranked Med-
ical School, College of Engineer-
ing and Business School, so one

Trojan horse attack
inflitrated security
system, lead to
massive shutdown
HADERA, Israel (AP) -
When Israel's military chief
delivered a high-profile speech
this month outlining the great-
est threats his country might
face in the future, he listed
computer sabotage as a top
concern, warning a sophisti-
cated cyberattack could one
day bring the nation to a stand-
still.
Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz was
not speaking empty words.
Exactly one month before his
address, a major artery in Isra-
el's national road network in
the northern city of Haifa was
shut down because of a cyberat-
tack, cybersecurity experts tell
The Associated Press, knock-
ing key operations out of com-
mission two days in a row and
causing hundreds of thousands
of dollars in damage.
One expert, speaking on con-
dition of anonymity because
the breach of security was a
classified matter, said a Trojan
horse attack targeted the secu-
rity camera system in the Car-
mel Tunnels toll road on Sept.
8. A Trojan horse is a malicious
computer program that users
unknowingly install that can
give hackers complete control
over their systems.
The attack caused an imme-
diate 20-minute lockdown of
the roadway. The next day, the
expert said, it shut down the
roadway again during morning
rush hour. It remained shut for
eight hours, causing massive
congestion.
The expert said investiga-
tors believe the attack was the
work of unknown, sophisti-
cated hackers, similar to the
Anonymous hacking group that
led attacks on Israeli websites
in April. He said investigators
determined it was not sophisti-
cated enough to be the work of
an enemy government like Iran.
The expert said Israel's
National Cyber Bureau, a two-
year-old classified body that
reports to the prime minister,
was aware of the incident. The
bureau declined comment,
while Carmelton, the compa-
ny that oversees the toll road,
blamed a "communication
glitch" for the mishap.
While Israel is a frequent
target of hackers, the tunnel is
the most high-profile landmark
known to have been attacked.
It is a major thoroughfare for
Israel's third-largest city, and
the city is looking to turn the
tunnel into a public shelter in
case ofemergency, highlighting

its importance.
The incident is exactly the
type of scenario that Gantz
described in his recent address.
He said Israel's. future battles
might begin with "a cyberat-
tack on websites which provide
daily services to the citizens of
Israel. Traffic lights could stop
working, the banks could be
shut down," he said.
There have been cases of
traffic tampering before. In
2005, the United States out-
lawed the unauthorized use
of traffic override devices
installed in many police cars
and ambulances after unscru-
pulous drivers started using
them to turn lights from red to
green. In 2008, two Los Ange-
les traffic engineers pleaded
guilty to breaking into the city's
signal system and deliberately
snarling traffic as part of alabor
dispute.
Oren David, a manager at
international security firm
RSA's anti-fraud unit, said that
although he didn't have infor-
mation about the tunnel inci-
dent, this kind of attack "is the
hallmark of a new era."
"Most of these systems are
automated, especially as far
as security is concerned.
They're automated and they're
remotely controlled, either over
the Internet or otherwise, so
they're vulnerable to cyberat-
tack," he said. Israel, he added,
is "among the top-targeted
countries."
In June, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran
and its proxies Hezbollah and
Hamas have targeted Israel's
"essential systems," including
its water system, electric grid,
trains and banks.
"Every sphere of civilian
economic life, let's not even
talk about our security, is a
potential or actual cyberattack
target," Netanyahu said at the
time.
Israeli government websites
receive hundreds and some-
times thousands of cyberat-
tacks each day, said Ofir Ben
Avi, head of the government's
website division.
During Israel's military
offensive on the Gaza Strip last
year, tens of millions of web-
site attacks took place, from
denial of service attacks, which
cripple websites by overload-
ing them with traffic, to more
sophisticated attempts to steal
passwords, Ben Avi said.
Under constant threat, Israel
has emerged as a world leader
in cybersecurity, with murky
military units developing much
of the technology. Last year,
the military formed its first
cyberdefense unit.
Israeli cybersecurity experts
say Iran and other hostile enti-
ties have successfully hacked

into Israeli servers this year,
and that Israel has quietly per-
mitted those attacks to occur in
order to track the hackers and
feed them false intelligence.
Israel is also widely believed
to have launched its own
sophisticated computer attacks
on its enemies, including the
Stuxnet worm that caused sig-
nificant damage to Iran's nucle-
ar program.
Bracing for serious attacks
on Israeli civilian infrastruc-
ture, Israel's national electric
company launched a training
program this month to teach
engineers and power plant
supervisors how to detect sys-
tem infiltrations.
The Israel Electric Corp.
says its servers register about
6,000 unique computer attacks
every second.
"Big organizations and even
countries are preparing for
D-Day," said Yasha Hain, a
senior executive vice president
at the company. "We decided to
prepare ourselves to be first in
line."
The training program is
run jointly with CyberGym, a
cyberdefense company founded
by ex-Israeli intelligence opera-
tives that consults for Israeli
oil, gas, transportation and
financial companies.
On a manicured campus
of eucalyptus trees across
from a power plant in Israel's
north, groups are divided into
teams in a role-playing game
of hackers and power plant
engineers.
The "hackers," code-named
the Red Team, sit in a dimly lit
room decorated with cartoon
villains on the walls. Darth
Vader hovers over binary code.
Kermit the Frog flashes his
middle finger.
In another room, a minia-
ture model of a power station
overflows with water and the
boiler's thermometer shoots
up as the role-playing hackers
run a "Kill All" code. The exer-
cise teaches employees how to
detect a possible cyberattack
even if their computer systems
don't register it.
About 25 middle-aged
employees attended the first
day of training last week. The
course will eventually train
thousands of workers, the elec-
tric company said.
CyberGym co-founder Ofir
Hason declined to comment on
the toll road shutdown, but said
the company has seen a number
of cyberattacks on infrastruc-
tures in recent years.
The country is especially
susceptible because Israel has
no electricity-sharing agree-
ments with neighboring states,
and all of the country's essen-
tial infrastructure depends on

Calif. gunman
dead following
brutal rampage

Gunman kills one,
injures three before
being shot by police
RIDGECREST, Calif. (AP)
- Sergio Munoz was known
around this small desert city to
acquaintances as a personable
dad, and to police for his long
rap sheet.
In recent weeks, he began
losing the moorings of a stable*
life - his job, then his family.
Kicked out of the house, he had
been staying at a friend's place,
using and dealing heroin.
Life fully unraveled. when
Munoz, with two hostages in his
trunk, led officers on a wild chase
Friday after killing a woman and
injuring his crash-pad friend.
He shot the friend after he had
refused to join what Munoz
planned would be afinalrampage
against police and "snitches."
Munoz knew the authorities
well enough that after the initial,
pre-dawn slaying he called one
patrol officer's cellphone and
announced that he wanted to kill
all police in town. But because
he would be outgunned at the
station he would instead "wreak
havoc" elsewhere, Kern County
Sheriff Donny Youngblood said
at a news conference Friday.
Munoz kept his word, first
firing at drivers in Ridgecrest,
according to police, then taking
shots at pursuing officers and
passingmotorists duringachase
along 30 miles of highway that
runs through the shrub-dotted
desert about 150 miles north of
Los Angeles. He ran traffic off
the road, firing at least 10 times
at passing vehicles with a shot-
gun and a handgun, though no
one was hurt.
In the end, Munoz pulled
over on U.S. 395, turned in his
seat and began shooting into the
trunk - which had popped open
earlier in the pursuit to reveal a
man and woman inside.
As many as seven officers
opened fire and killed him. The
hostages were flown to a hospi-
tal in critical condition, but were
expected to survive. Their names
have not been released and police
have not said anything about
their relationship to Munoz
except that he knew them.
In the neighborhood where

the first shooting happened,
people said Munoz was an affa-
ble man who would stop to chat,
revealing no signs of inner tur-
moil.
"He didn't show any anger,"
said Edgar Martinez, who
would see Munoz at a nearby
gym and said he cleaned his
house several years ago.
Others described him as
respectful and humble.
But recently, his life began to
crumble.
First, he became unemployed.
According to his Facebook page,
Munoz worked at Searles Valley
Minerals, a company that makes
products such as borax and soda
ash by extracting a salty mix
from beneath a desert lake bed.
It was not clear whether he lost
his job at Searles, or another
business, and officials at Searles
were unreachable Saturday.
Last Sunday, Munoz, 39, was
arrested again - police found
ammunition and a syringe atthe
house where the, slaying would
happen five days later. Munoz is
a felon with convictions dating
back to 1994, when he was sen-
tenced to more than two years
in prison for receiving stolen
property. In May, he was arrest-
ed for possessing ammunition
as a felon, but the felony charge
was dismissed.
After making bail on the lat-
est arrest, Munoz returned to
the house where he first started
staying about two weeks ago.
A neighbor heard Munoz
bemoaning his life, saying he was
losing everything due to drugs.
"He was a cool guy," said the
neighbor, Derrick Holland. "He
was just losing his mind."
Munoz's estranged wife, San-
dra Leiva, said that they sepa-
rated because she finally had
enough of his bad choices.
"Tough love and drugs, that's
what brought him down," Leiva
said.
On Saturday morning,
Munoz's 15-year-old daugh-
ter, Viviana, reflected on her
father's life in a Facebook post.
"Your such a great dad
when you were not on drugs...I
remember how you used always
try and teach us how to dance
all crazy with your chicken legs
haha," she wrote. "You were a
good father and person, you just
made a sad choice."

Iaconesi and
Persico combine
arts activism
By GIANCARLO BUONOMO
For the Daily
In even a brief look at the web-
site for SalvatoreIaconesi and Ori-
ana Persico's project Art is Open
Source (AOS), the word "activism"
immediately comes to mind. Click
here, and discover how Iaconesi
and Persico, both native Italians,
created a smartphone app that
directed protesters to safety dur-
ing the 2011 Occupy movement
protests in .Rome. Click there,
and meet AngelF, a digital baby
whose right to unlimited informa-
tion was broughtbeforethe United
Nations. Everything feels straight
out of "The Matrix," without the
kung-fu sequences.
So, are Iaconesi and Persico the
Neo and Trinity of the art world?
The Daily sat down with the art-
ists after they gave a lecture for the
Penny W. Stamps Distinguished
Speaker Series.
"In all of our art, in general, we
really tend to be non-judgmental,"
Iaconesi said. "Obviously we have
an opinion, but our interest is not
to expose this opinion. Our inter-
est is to expose mechanisms,-how
things work."
In a world that has increasingly
become a complex technological
network, AOS tears off the com-
forting blanket of advertising and
instant gratification to educate
everyone on how technology influ-
ences our lives, or in some cases,
becomes ourlives.
"It's like water infrastructure,"
Iaconesi said. "When you turn on
the water in the sink, you don't
think that you are producing pol-
lution from the pipes."

"So," he continued, "technology
has basically disappeared, and it
has become a part of our common
life, a utility." -
Technology is an ubiquitous
utility of modern life, no doubt.
So ubiquitous in fact that it raises
some interesting, and possibly
uncomfortable, questions. For
example, can someone have a
"real" identity and a digital one?
AOS claims that that there isn't
much of a separation.
"Digital technologies have
made the idea of identity liquid,"
Iaconesi said.
Added Persico: "The possibility
to express 'multividuality' is enor-
mous now."
However, this fluidityis notlim-
ited to the "real" world versus the
digital world. According to AOS,
"multividuality" is present in the
"real" world allthe time. The mod-
ern "multividual" can be one per-
son with their boss, another with
a friend, another with a professor
and it's all a result of rules.
"Imagine how you live your life
everyday," Iaconesi said. "Depend-
ing onwhere you are, in what con-
text you are, different sets of rules
apply."
In its lecture, AOS used shop-
ping malls as an example of this
scenario. A shopping mall has
many rules and restrictions about
whatshoppers can buy, where they
can eat, how late they can stay, etc.
However, because a shoppingrmall
is designed to look like a public
space, it gives shoppers an illusion
of freedom. This example illus-
trates a less obvious, but possibly
more dangerous one.
"This is a very similar situation
to what happens online," Iaco-
nesi said. "Facebook, Twitter are
designed as public spaces; they are
made to look, as much as possible,
like public spaces, but they really
are not, like the shopping center,

and this has incredible limits on
your freedom of expression.
"What our problem is is that
(Facebook) is a social infrastruc-
ture that is privately owned."
For AOS, the private ownership
of what has essentially become a
country with over a billion resi-
dents is troubling, because this
"United States of Facebook" is a
country without a bill of rights or
due process.
"Facebook, when you subscribe
to the terms of service, actually
tells you that it is free to change,
at any time, without consent, the
terms of service," Iaconesi said.
"It's very dangerous," he con-
tinued, "because it's a thing that
changes, that affects your privacy,
but there's no social process con-
nected to it. Facebook can change
in ways that go way beyond my
basic rights."
With statements like these, it's
hard, yetagain, not to label Iacone-
si and Persico as activists. But, once
again, they insist that they just give
people, like students atthe Univer-
sity, the necessary information to
make their own choices regarding
social media.
"The very first beginning of
everything is giving the possibil-
ity to visualize all of these mecha-
nisms that are going on," Persico
said. "Then we will see. It's not our
job to judge."
Evenifpeople know all of these
scary truths about technology,
from Facebook's privacy viola-
tions to the horrible workingcon-
ditions in iPhone factories, they
probably remain plugged into
social media. Iaconesi and Persico
are perfect examples - even after
years of research and lecturing,
they still use Facebook, Twitter,
email and smartphones to educate
others.
"We live in contradictions,"
Persico said.

Something is rotten in the state of California.

Zombies are the new black.
'Walking Dead'
comes back to life

New showrunner
resurrects popular
zombie tale
By DREW MARON
Daily Arts Writer
At its core, "The Walking Dead"
is about a whole lot more than just
killing zombies. It's a show about
how we keep
our humanity in A-
a world gone to
hell and whether The Walking
or not we can go Dead
back to the way
things were. The Season four,
show's problems episodes one
have always and two
been the direc-
tion the two Sundaysat
previous show- 9 P.M.
runners were AMC
taking it in.
Frank
Darabont (director of "The Shaw-
shank Redemption" and first head
writer for "The Walking Dead")
definitely brought the tragedy of it
all with a cinematic scope seldom
seen in television, yet the first sea-
sonlacked a real overarchingstory-
line to bridge the gap from episode
to episode. Darabont's successor in
the second season, Glen Mazarra,
tried to fix that with more story
arcs and action, but despite stellar
ratings, the characters never felt
like they were striving toward any-
thingbeyond simply"not dying."
With third-time's-the-charm
showrunner Scott Gimple, how-
ever, "Walking Dead" fans can rest,

assured. The show's focus is finally
whereitneedstobe: givingus hope
in aworld where so little ofit exists.
Right off the bat, the first epi-
sode of season four, "30 Days
Without an Accident," goes down
the checklist of previous wrongs in
pretty much the easiest way pos-
sible: making Michonne (Danai
Gurira, "Treme"), the mysterious
sword-wielding survivor, smile.
And more than just smile, mind
you. She laughs, she jokes and she
cries (more on that in a second).
One of the biggest problems the
past three seasons have faced is
its female characters. The most
notable examples being Andrea
(Laurie Holden, "The Shield")
and Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies,
"Black November") with the for-
mer repeatedly failing atbeingjust
as tough as one of the boys (only to
fail... alot) and the latter being the
third-worst parent on television
behind Donald Draper and Walter
White.
Though I'm sure a lot of peo-
ple might be relieved those two
are gone, I honestly kind of wish
Scott Gimple took a shot at flesh-
ing them out first. From these first
episodes, Gimple shows an innate
understanding of these characters
and how living in this world has
changed them, for good or bad.
Carol (Melissa McBride, "Liv-
ing Proof") started off as a mousy
housewife in an abusive relation-
ship. Four seasons later, she's a
badass, teachingthe younger mem-
bers knife fighting and the more
unpleasant aspects of the zombie
apocalypse.

But undoubtedly the biggest
change has been just how much
deeper we seem to be getting into
Michonne. Her constant paranoia
and scowling last season became
tiresome and one-note, and fans of
the comic series were worried their
beloved post-apocalyptic samu-
rai would never be fully realized.
Fortunately, Gurira finally shows
us what the producers saw in the
actress when casting her last sea-
son. She is establishing a familial
link with the prison the rest of the
group already shares. Her vulner-
ability reveals itself in full force
in the second episode, "Infected,"
where Michonne tearfully breaks
while holding baby Judith. It was
heart-rending while still keeping
Michonne's pastcfirmlyin the camp
of mysterious, adding even more
layers to her enigmatic past.
"Walking Dead" creator Robert
Kirkman has always said the title of
the show is a reference both to the
zombie-like walkers and the survi-
vors themselves who are dead - in
the sense that without society and
thethingsweconstitute as"making
us alive" we are, ina sense, "dead."
It's a bleak idea, and the show
reflected that continuously these
past three seasons, but what it
has ignored' is the presence of
hope. Season four reminds us of
the little things that keep these
people going: the hope that
maybe, despite all the suffer-
ing and death, there still might
be light at the end of the tunnel.
That's what "The Walking Dead"
is about: not avoiding death, but
fighting for life.

I don't always drink. lot whet I do, it's self-obsession."
DJ Khaled is'Suffering'
from mediocrity

Hollywood glamorizes Beats
ByKAREN YUAN
For the Daily
Allen Ginsberg was an amateur
photographer. Throughout his
years with fellow Beat poets and
artists, he took hundreds of pic-
tures of familiar faces - Kerouac,
Burroughs, Cassidy - to document
the lives they led. Few of the pic-
tures were candid shots, and Ithink
this was because Ginsbergknew, at
least remotely, that their lives were SONY PICTURES CLASSICS
made for the camera. There was Drop the Beatnicks.

By ALLEN DONNE
Daily Arts Writer
I cannot be the only one to
wonder who DJ Khaled is or
what he does. Here's an artist
who has released seven albums,
has become a recognized name
in music, but doesn't perform in
any songs except for the inter-
spersed yet emphatic yelling
of his name. With the recent
release of his album, Suffering
from Success, I journeyed into
Khaled's seventh release, deter-
mined to discover this role and
how he is "suffering from suc-
cess."
Immediately, the tone of
the album is established with
an excerpt from Obama's sec-
ond election victory address
with "All I Do Is Win" play-
ing in the background. From
this lone excerpt, we discover
the album's purpose - that DJ
Khaled and ls featured com-
pany are the best there are. And
Khaled does nothing to make
this subtle, directly saying on
a later track that they are "the
best music."
Such a tone, though,
should've been expected. A sim-
ple glance at the list of features
just yells megalomania. Rick
Ross appears multiple times
on different tracks mainly as
a caricature that grunts while
Meek Mill screams as if he
were still stuck on a helicopter.
Big Sean shows up a few times
and says "I do it" and "Oh
God." Even Drake sacrifices
his well known soft side to fit
the theme of the album. And,
of course, everyone raps about
how great they are, money, or
both. One track is even disre-
spectfully titled "I Feel Like
Pac / I Feel Like Biggie" to
describe the level of greatness
these rappers believe they have
achieved.
With such little depth in sub-
ject, the best way to describe
the first half of the album is
a blur. There were moments
where I had to check if I was
listening to one continuous
song with many interludes. It
is actually amazing how much
substance these artists can
derive from material goods,
women, personal status and
net worth. In between, Khaled
continues his declaration of
phrases that sometimes come
out of nowhere. And noisy,
booming beats overpower the
ear drums. Even the words,
though screeching in delivery,
are hard to discern when the
bass starts to crescendo - not
that it matters. Once we've
understood the lyrics to one
song, we've understood the
lyrics to

Too niche for
its own good.
On the surface, all these people
have problems that are remotely
relatable. Unfortunately, the pre-
miere fails to give them any signifi-
cant depth.Their simplicity,instead
of adding toward any sense of like-
ability or personality, just makes

the show appear more fake than
it probably already is. At the very
least, the contrived confessionals
do little to dispel the stereotype
that reality TV isn't very reflec-
tive of reality. For other reality TV
programs, this could be forgivable
if the results were entertaining,
but for now, the apparent fakeness
is kind of a problem considering
the show's main themes center
on wholesome family values and
American patriotism.
The more informative elements
of the show share in this shallow-
ness. Each stunt has some math-
ematical factor to it, whether it
be trying to find the right speed
to land a car jump or figuring out
the physics behind surviving a
high fall. The premiere doesn't
ignore the math side to the stunts
completely, but when it does work
with math, it keeps things rather
simplified, appealing to the lowest
common denominator. That isn't
to say the calculations should be as
in-depth as possible, but it's clear
the show held back for the sake
of a greater mass appeal. Anyone
looking to learn more about the
technical side of beinga daredevil
will be disappointed, because the
show shies away from any detailed
insight.

The same can be said when
"Daredevils" touches on the pro-
fession's history. Stunt perform-
ing has faded in appeal over the
decades and become more of a
niche form of entertainment, but
- the show doesn't explore this
development to any great degree,
and when it does, it's mostly for the
purposes of romanticizingthe pro-
fession instead ofactually tryingto
be informative. Evel Knievel is the
most referenced daredevil icon in
the premiere, a sort of ideal stunt-
man every daredevil tries to live up
to and surpass. Beyond this admi-
ration, however, and a few tidbits
about Knievel's most famous stunt,
the show spends little time on any
historical relevance there may
be on the subject. Perhaps this is
enough to earn the show's place on
The History Channel (well, prob-
ably not), but it certainly doesn't
help raise the show above its oth-
erwise mediocre quality.
The show's few redeeming fea-
tures reside inhowit creates stakes
and builds suspense, but that's sort
of a given based on its premise.
Beyond that, the premiere makes it
difficult to recommend "American
Daredevils," unless one has apar-
ticular interest or passion in the
subject matter.

"We Are the Champions" plays ironically in the distance.

The Michigan hockey team picked up a come-from-behind victory over Boston University on Friday but finally took its first loss of the season with a 2-1 loss to UMass-Lowe ll the next night. The Riven Hawkhs are the preseason Hockey East-favoite.

in 22 years. Then, two of their

Berenson admitted that his
team hadn't proved it could win

- it was even simply finding
ways not to lose.
For two periods, the fears
of the 5,535 fans in atten-

the beginning of last year,
Michigan entered with a high
national ranking. Like last year,
it boasted a slew of offensive
weapons but had uncertainty at
the goaltender position. After
40 minutes on Friday, the Wol-

verines were outshooting No.

were somehow, inexplicably,
impossibly on the wrong end of
the scoreboard, down 1-0.
"It was a little bit of a frus-
trating experience," said junior
forward Alex Guptill.
The sentiment was seemingly
echoed by sophomore forward
Andrew Copp, who paused to
glance back at the scoreboard

with a mixture of surprise
and disbelief when the public-.
address announcer read off the
shot totals at the end of the sec-
ond period.
And who could blame them?
They had a chance to beat one
of the most storied programs
in the country and, in the eyes
of Berenson, a top-10 team.
Instead, they were losing

For the Daily
The Michigan men's soc-
cer team continued its strong
play of late on Saturday night,
defeating Indiana, 2-1, at U-M
Soccer Stadium. The Wol-
verines beat the defending
national champions in con-
vincing fashion for their first
three-game winning streak of
the season and their first-ever
home win against the Hoosiers.
"Beating the national cham-
pions helps our mentality and
the culture we're trying to
create with Michigan men's
soccer," said Michigan coach

Chaka Daley. "To get that
result was something we talk-
ed about in terms of creating
our own legacy."
While Indiana (1-3 Big Ten,
5-10-1 overall) has an unim-
pressive record this season,
Daley was well aware that this
was a program-defining victo-
ry over a team that has histori-
cally dominated the Big Ten.
Michigan (3-2, 7-4-3) played
aggressively from the opening
whistle, as redshirt senior mid-
fielder Tyler Arnone sent the
ball beautifully from the right
flank to senior forward Mal-
colm Miller in the second min-
ute. Miller slid past the ball,

barely missing the opportunity
to poke it into the left corner.
Michigan continued knock-
ing on the door throughout the
first half of play, outshooting
Indiana, 7-4.
The Wolverines seemed
especially likely to get on the
board first during a sequence
in which four players had great
chances to score, but none
could capitalize. Between the
37th and 39th minutes, Arnone
blasted the ball high over the
net off a deflection, senior mid-
fielder Fabio Pereira had his
shot blocked by Indiana goal-
keeper Michael Soderlund and

"And I remember hearing one

"I laughed."
This is the new reality for the

Wolverines were the youngest
team in the NCAA Tournament.
This year, they're even younger.
And for the 12 players out of 14
who are freshmen or sopho-
mores, most don't even remem-
ber the old, anonymous days of
Michigan basketball, when the
team regularly played in a half-

"Nobody knows what it was

situation."

Redshirt junior forward Jon Horford remembers when Crisler was half empty.

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
The Michigan men's basketball team's sophomore class has quickly become leaders on a team with 12 underclassmen.

2007, Beilein was here for his
first media day as Michigan's
coach, with a considerably
smaller crowd.
Then, Crisler Arena was old
and rather lifeless. Players that
day did interviews on the court
under the numbing buzz of the
fluorescent lights.
Now, in the new media room,
in the renovated Crisler Center
with the new hardware on dis-
play in the trophy cases in front,
Beilein looked out at the biggest

"Look at this room," Beilein
said. "The environment changes
very quickly when you're able to
make the run that we did."
The change didn't happen
quickly, until suddenly it did.
Since Beilein took over in 2007,
the program has advanced in
neat increments almost every r
year. In Beilein's first season,
Michigan lost the most games
in its history. The next year,
Michigan beat Duke and UCLA,
both ranked No. 4 at the time,
and earned a herth in the NCAA

Tournament. Michigan returned
to the tournament in 2011. In
2012, the Wolverines shared a
Big Ten title.
But last year, the program
progressed by leaps: the first No.
1 ranking in two decades; the
National Player of the Year; and
an appearance in the National
Championship.
Within weeks, Michigan's
players became household
names. The campus that
wouldn't even show up to games
three vears earlier flooded the

streets followingthe champion-
ship game loss. Ann Arbor had
become a basketball town.
Now, of all the players on the
roster, only Morgan has expe-
rienced a season without an
NCAA Tournament - his red-
shirt year in 2009-10. Redshirt
junior Jon Horford is the only
other upperclassman on this
year's team.
So during a film study just
more than a week ago, the team
watched a game from the 2010-
11 season. The video panned
over the student section. Mor-
gan was in his second year then.
Horford was a freshman. He
estimated, exaggerating only
slightly, that there were about
40 students at the game. In the
film room, the rest of the team
was incredulous.
"And I'm like, yeah, you guys
don't really know what we went
through," Morgan said.
Thanks to the Final Four run,
and the unusually young roster,
the Michigan basketball culture
has shifted remarkably quickly.
Now, the team isn't worried
about how many fans will show
up. This year, more students
requested student tickets than
space allowed. Now, the team
is more concerned with limit-
ing the distractions of budding
stardom.
It seems life has gone on as
usual only for the diminutive
sophomore point guard Spike
Albrecht, an influx of Twitter
followers notwithstanding. .
"I'm the same old Spike," he
said to a group of reporters, add-
ing: "I mean, I look like all of
you guys, so I kind of blend in on
campus."
But his taller teammates have
had a harder time hidingAnd
most have everyday interactions
that would've seemed comi-
cally farfetched while Morgan
or Horford were underclass-
men. Sophomore forward Mitch
McGary was recently asked to
sign someone's forehead. ("It

was a dude," McGary said. "I'm
like I'm not going to sign your
forehead, dude, I'm sorry.") A
group of girls asked him for a
kiss, and he declined that, too.
Sophomore guard Nik Staus-
kas says he'll often walk by
gaping students on campus.
They won't say anything as they
walk by, but they will Tweet at
him minutes later, he says, tell-
ing him they saw him. Horford
said after the Final Four he was
often as much as 20 minutes late
to class because people asked
him for pictures or autographs,
and-"I don't have the heart to
tell people you gotta leave me
alone," he said.
Beilein says he tells the team
that they live every day "on
Times Square."
"If you want to read about
yourself, you could go read about
yourself all day long," Beilein
said. "It's very important they
understand what's really impor-
tant. And it's not that clutter."
After Beilein spoke, the play-
ers answered questions from
the media in a neat row of tables
along the west sideline, under
the new bright lights and still-
sparkling concourses of Crisler
Center. Then the players dunked
and laughed and warmed up for
practice. Professional scouts
watched from beyond the south
baseline.
Morgan says that for 12 of
his teammates, this is normal,
expected. Only he and Horford
know how far the program had
to come to get here.
When they are gone, for bet-
ter or worse, those memories
will be gone.
It's just something you had
to go through to understand,
Horford said. And for now, it's
just fine with him if Michigan's
newest starsnever understand
again.

only answered any lingering
doubts about their program, but
demonstrated how it's stronger
than it has been in the better
span of a decade.
With a little less than 17
minutes remaining, the build-
ing groaned when an apparent
Michigan goal was disallowed.
But it didn't really matter in the
end.
Five minutes later, freshman
forward Tyler Motte tied the
game with a one-timer, and the
team's reaction was as much a
sigh of relief it was as a celebra-
tion.
Last year, the Wolverines
might not have found an equal-
izer.
But the freshman was in the
right place at the right time - as
he has been all season - to net
his fourth career goal.
"You go out in practice every
day, and this is the reason you
come here, to play games like
these," Motte said.
The Boston University net-
minder responded later in the
period by punching senior for-
ward Luke Moffatt in the head,
a play that went unpunished
by the referees. But Michigan
didn't need to fight back, not like
that. Halfway through the final
period, Guptill was upended
ona reakaway and awarded a
penalty shot. It was a dubious
call, but after equally suspect
calls at New Hampshire, it was
a fortuitous break a week in the
making.
Guptill made the Terriers pay,
going five-hole on the goaltender
to put Michigan ahead for good,

and Yost's 90-year-old structure
shook in response.
"It'll get louder,"Berenson
said. "If our team plays well,
we'll hear about it."
That the Wolverines lost to
Massachusetts-Lowell, 2-1, on
Saturday night was little more
than a minor inconvenience.
The River Hawks were the top-
ranked team-in the preseason
polls and projected to win Hock-
ey East, and "it was anyone's
game, right down to the very
end," according to Berenson.
"You can't win them all," said
senior defenseman Mac Bennett.
They won't, but they've come
pretty close so far.,Michigan
faced five ranked opponents in
its first six games - perhaps the
toughest stretch it'll encounter
in the regular season - and fin-
ished 4-1-1.
So come back to Yost, because
this year, the Wolverines are for
real.
They've proven as much
through the first three weekends
of the season, erasing lingering
doubts and establishingthem-
selves as the team to beat in the
Big Ten.
As the final moments of Fri-
day's win ticked away, freshman
forward JT Compher and Ter-
rier defenseman Doyle Somerby
tussled behind the Boston
University net. Somerby gave a
shove as the final horn sounded,
hut by then Compher had began
to skate towards center ice with
his stick raised.
There were no questions left
to answer; that fight was already
won.

second-half flurry for Michigan


By MIKE PISCIO TTA
For the Daily
For the second straight game,
the Michigan men's soccer team
found itself tied 1-1, heading
into the final five minutes of the
match against Indiana on Satur-
day. And for the second straight
game, the Wolverines managed
to seal a 2-1 victory against a Big
Ten foe thanks to a late game
winner. Junior midfielder TJ
VanSlooten's 87th-minute goal
propelled Michigan to a victory
over the Hoosiers for the surg-
ing Wolverines' third consecu-
tive win.
With three minutes remain-
ing and overtime looming,
freshman defender Rylee Woods
sprinted down the left flank and
whipped in a hopeful cross into
the Indiana box. Hoosier 'goal-
keeper Michael-Soderlund came
out to claim the ball, but instead
of catching it, he fumbled the
ball into the path of freshman
defender Lars Eckenrode. Eck-
enrode instinctively poked
the ball toward the path of the
oncoming VanSlooten, who slot-
ted the ball into the back of the
net to give Michigan the lead.

2. Michigan's offense won't be
potent until it buries its chances.
The Wolverines tallied 83
shots in two games. They scored
on just three of them.
For what has been deemed one
the deepest units he's ever seen,
Berenson has reason to be upset
with a .036 shot percentage.
It's clear Michigan can create
chances, which should theoreti-
cally mean more goals, but that
hasn't been the case. .
"We have to score more than
one goal at home," Berenson
said Saturday. "We've got to take
advantage of our chances better
than we did tonight."
Freshman forward Tyler
Motte had one of those scoring
chances late against the River
Hawks on Saturday, when he
received the puck nearthe crease
with an open net but sent it wide
left. Senior forward Derek DeB-
lois also failed to finish with an
open net, pushing his shot just
wide.
It doesn't help when both of

the Michigan defense as it had
trouble winning the ball in the

chances for Indiana in the first
half, and eventually, a goal from
Andrew Oliver in the 43rd min-
ute.
"We had a much better per-

Pereira said. "Our resiliency is
what changed the game."
With freshman goalkeeper
Grant Mattia in net, the Wol-
verines' defense needed to be at
its best for the final 45 minutes,
and it stepped up to the chal-
lenge. Michigan completely shut
down the Indiana attack, allow-
ing only one shot on goal, which
came in the final minute of the
game, and preventing any other
chances to preserve the victory.

With the introduction of
VanSlooten and freshman for-
ward Yamann Sahlool, the Wol-

The Wolverines' attack was

but Indiana's Andrew Oliver beat
him and headed the ball into the

1-0 lead. Despite being outplayed
in the first half, the Hoosiers sur-
prisingly led at the break.
Due to an injury, Grinwis was
replaced by freshman goalkeep-
er Grant Mattia at the half. He
played valiantly in the first game
action of his career, blanking
Indiana the rest of the way and
allowing Michigan to get back in
the game.
The breakthrough came in the
70th minute, as Pereira crossed
the ball from the right corner
to freshman forward Yamann
Sahlool. The substitute beat the

Hoosiers' back line and grace-
fully headed the ball into the top
left corner for the second goal
of his career, to finally tying the
game at 1-1.
"Yamann scored a great goal
tonight, just put himself in the
right position at the right time,"
Daley said. "His header into the
back of the net got our momen-
tum going."
The game winner came in the
88th minute as a run.by Woods

Woods served the ball into the

Freshman defender Lars Eck-

ball and found VanSlooten who
knocked it past the goalie from
just a few yards out to complete
the come-from-behind 2-1 win
over the Hoosiers.
Michigan is proving to be a
strong second-half team, with
this trend continuing against
Indiana.
"Earlier in the year, I think we
lacked confidence late in games,
but now (the players) are saying
that we're a second half team
and that their energy gets better
as the game goes on," Daley said.
"They were late goals, but they
were really good goals at the end
of the day."
Indiana's only shot on goal in

Ten teams will play comparable,

means the Wolverines won't be

Meanwhile, Compher continues
to create scoring chances when

"We're all the same age, and
we've all been together for a few
years," Allen said. "Me and Tyler

so I think we have a lot in com-
mon on the ice and off the ice."

3. The all-freshmen line is play- 4. Penalties will be costlier than
ing like it's a veteran line. usual.

At the end of Friday's contest
against Boston University, with a
slim 2-1 lead in the waning sec-
onds, Berenson sent out the third
line of freshmen Motte, JT Com-
pher and Evan Allen.
The 11th-ranked Terriers
pulled their netminder in the
final minutes in attempt to tie
the game and fired more shots in
the third period than the previ-
ous two, but the young line held
on for the win.
The move was bold of Beren-
son, who said prior to the sea-
son that he had planned to put
younger players with experi-
enced ones. It demonstrates his
early trust in unproven players at
the collegiate level.
"I justhad agood feel for these
three," Berenson said. "They're
competing hard. They're always
making good decisions on the
ice."
All three were members of the
U.S. NationalTeamDevelopment
Program last year and show solid
chemistry on the ice. Saturday's
game was the first in the past five
games that Motte did not score.

The Wolverines have allowed
five power-play goals thus far,
good for 27th fewest in the
nation.
The middle-of-the-pack num-
bers don't tell the whole story.
Michigan takes 13.2 penalty
minutes per game, which both
players and coaches alike have
said disrupts the team's rhythm
and flow.
The Wolverines have strug-
gled the most during games in
which they have sat in the penal-
ty box the longest. Against RIT,
Michigantook seven penalties in
the second period and allowed
four goals in the same frame.
Tied at one midway through
the third period of Saturday's
contest, junior forward Phil
Di Giuseppe again proved why
the penalties are costly. He was
called for checking from behind
and subsequently given a game
misconduct. The five-minute
major that ensued strained
Michigan's defense and kept the
Wolverines out of the offensive
zone.
The penalty ultimately result-

ed in a goal allowed, which stood
as the game winner.
"Killing a five-minute pen-
alty is tough," Bennett said. "I
thought we almost had it, but it
was too little, too late. They capi-
talized, and we couldn't come
back from that."
When the Wolverines play
their best hockey, they stay out
of the box and hold onto the
puck longer. Michigan will have
to stay disciplined against rivals
like Michigan State and Ohio
State later in the season if it
wants any shot at keeping games
close.
5. Bold Prediction: Michigan
won't lose again in 2013.
The Wolverines played three
top-20 teams with an untested
defense and were without their
starting goaltender for half of
their games to the start the sea-
son and finished 4-1-1.
Michigan won't face another
top-20 team this year if the rank-
ings remain similar to where
they are now, which looks good
for the Wolverines on paper.
Their next two opponents -
Michigan Tech and Nebraska-
Omaha - have combined for
three wins this season, and the
competition afterward, teams
like Niagara and Ferris State,
doesn't appear much better.
As the defense gains experi-
ence and with Racine eventually
back to full health, the season
looks promising to end the calen-
dar year.

Lacking consistency, 'M' falls to Purdue

By ZACH SHAW
Daily Sports Writer
Just three days after sinking
No. 10 Michigan State in four sets
in East Lansing, the No. 17 Mich-
igan volleyball team found itself
facing yet another ranked Big
Ten opponent in No. 21 Purdue.
Any momentum from the
rivalry win on the road failed to
carry over to Cliff Keen Arena
Saturday as the Wolverines (4-6
Big Ten, 14-7 overall) fell to the
Boilermakers, 3-1.
The match began with a back-
and-forth battle in the first set.
The balanced and powerful Pur-
due offense was countered time
and again by the fearless Wolver-
ine defense as the intensity rose
with the score. Eventually, how-
ever, Michigan gave way as the
Boilermakers (6-4, 15-6) took five
of the last six points for a 25-20
victory.

"Our goal is to be balanced
offensively; we don't want to be a
team built on one player that can
be stopped."
On a team talented enough to
beat the nation's elite over the
- past two seasons, consistency
has been the biggest obstacle
for Michigan this season. Satur-
day was no exception, as 20 of
28 Wolverine errors occurred in
the last two sets. It was flashes of
brilliance followed by futility.
"Before we can look at other
teams, we need to focus on us,"
Rosen said. "We need to focus
on being more consistent in our

E THELIOII

As well as Purdue played in the
first set, the Michigan defense
buckled down in the second. The
Wolverines played near-perfect
volleyball, committing just two
errors while never trailing en
route to a 25-13 win.
"I thought our team did an
amazing job coming back in the
second set," Rosen said. "It was a
really good change that we made
defensively. Our blocking, floor
defense, we were getting digs,
but we also managed to get a lot
of points in transition and that
was big for our team."
The third set began as a mir-
ror image of the second, and it
appeared Michigan would go
on to its fourth Big Ten victory
in its last five tries. Led by flaw-
less serves and unrelenting digs,
the Wolverines cruised to a 16-9
lead, much to the delight of the
1,220 fans, many of whom stood
up in anticipation of an easy vic-
tory.
But over the next several min-
utes, Purdue scored eight unan-
swered points to take the lead.
It would be the final lead change
of the night, as the Boilermak-
ers won the third set, 25-22, and
effortlessly clinched the match
with a 25-20 fourth-set win in
which they never trailed.
