The School of Music, Theatre 

& Dance at the University of 
Michigan hosted a forum for 
students and faculty Tuesday 
night, shedding light on University 
sexual misconduct policies. The 
forum also offered a space for 
students to voice concerns, and 
included a panel of representatives 
from University offices dealing 
with cases of misconduct. Despite 
the discussion, some students said 
they still left the event with more 
questions.

The event came amid piling 

accusations against Prof. David 
Daniels, 
a 
world-renowned 

countertenor singer, and the 

University’s alleged inaction in 
addressing them, as well as 
The 
Daily’s 
account 
of 
an 

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

student’s experience navigating a 
painful investigation process.

Jason Corey, associate dean of 

Graduate Studies at the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance, opened 
up the event by citing the need for 
transparency between students 
and the offices that handle sexual 
misconduct allegations at the 
University.

“We heard from many of you 

that there was a need for face-to-
face opportunities for students to 
voice concerns and ask questions 
about how sexual misconduct 
incidents are handled,” Corey 
said. “We thought it best to have 

One of the most popular 

classes that fulfills the Race 
and 
Ethnicity 
requirement, 

Cultural Anthropology 101, or 
Introduction to Anthropology, 
is 
moving 
away 
from 
its 

previous 
honors 
discussion 

course to pilot a new section 
similar to the Program on 
Intergroup 
Relations 
this 

upcoming winter semester.

Last spring, students filed 

their 
grievances 
toward 

the previously altered Race 
and 
Ethnicity 
requirement, 

highlighting 
that 
major 

lectures 
including 
Cultural 

Anthropology 
101 
and 

History 
101 
merely 
graze 

over these topics and make 
“vague connections to race 
and 
ethnicity 
rather 
than 

a 
structured 
focus.” 
The 

problem, 
they 
reported, 

was the size of these classes 
hindered the students’ ability 
to 
cultivate 
effective 
and 

critical discussions. Students 
sought a more consolidated 
class where race and ethnicity 
was the main thread.

LSA 
sophomore 
Hannah 

Walsh said she found this 
problem to be present within 
her race and ethnicity course, 
History 105, Introduction to 
Religion.

“I was really excited to learn 

more about different religions, 
cultures and different parts of 
the world and how everyone 

thinks and acts differently — 
which is what the requirement 
is for,” Walsh said. “Yet, I 
learned 
about 
Christianity, 

cults and other random vague 
terms that did not fit one 
religion or another. It was 
all very abstract; I came out 
knowing how to define sacred 
and profane but not even 
learning the slightest bit of 
history about Buddhism or 
Islam.”

With 
these 
problems 
in 

mind, 
Stephanie 
Hicks, 
a 

lecturer within the Program of 
Intergroup Relations, reached 
out to Cultural Anthropology 
prof. Jason De Leon to find a 
way to foster more centralized 
discussion 
and 
to 
provide 

a more dialogic experience 

within their courses.

“IGR is unique because it 

allows students to learn in 
different ways as it isn’t a 
traditional 
lecture 
course,” 

Hicks said. “Students get to 
engage 
with 
experimental 

learning, they get to take part 
in various activities, they get 
to focus on their own learning 
experiences — so I think there 
is a real possibility to help 
the students understand the 
concepts they’re learning in 
Anthro in a really different 
way.”

Taking into consideration 

the current political climate, 
De Leon—who won a coveted 
MacArthur 
genius 
grant 

last year for his research on 
immigration— 
believes 
the 

new discussion section will not 
only be more beneficial toward 
students 
looking 
to 
create 

connections between race and 
ethnicity and anthropology, but 
will also help the University as 
a whole in its attempt to create 
a more inclusive and diverse 
community. 

“In general, I think more 

sustained and official venues 
that can provide students 
an opportunity to discuss 
issues od (Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion) are always 
needed, especially in this 
current political climate,” De 
Leon wrote in an email to The 
Daily. 

Gloria Hwang, CEO of a 

bike helmet company called 
Thousand, 
Boma 
Brown-

West, senior manager of the 
Environmental Defense Fund 
and Erin Patten, CEO of hair 
product company DāO Detroit 
and spoke to about 50 students 
and faculty at the University of 
Michigan Tuesday night for a 
panel of business professionals 
on 
sustainability-focused 

workplaces. 
The 
panel, 

titled “The Voice of Business 
Sustainability,” was moderated 
by Taryn Petryk, director of 
Diversity and Inclusion at the 
Ross School of Business. 

The event was hosted by 

the Frederic A. & Barbara M. 
Erb Institute, a dual-degree 
program 
and 
partnership 

organization 
between 
the 

Business 
School 
and 
the 

School for Environment and 
Sustainability. 

Petryk started the discussion 

by saying the goal of the panel 
was to bring awareness to 
and normalize conversations 
around diversity and identity.

The University of Michigan 

Central Student Government 

met Thursday evening in the 
Hussey Room of the Michigan 

League to discuss proposals 
up 
for 
approval. 
CSG 

President Daniel Greene, 
a Public Policy senior, 
kicked off the meeting by 
announcing the Inclusivity 
Project, 
an 
initiative 

student government will 
be pursuing within the 
University’s 
Diversity, 

Equity 
and 
Inclusion 

strategic plan. According 
to Greene, the goal of the 
initiative is to improve 
the diversity of student 
organizations through a 
total evaluation of each 
organization’s procedures 
to foster diversity and 
inclusivity. 

“The hope is to get to 

the everyday peer-to-peer 
interactions,” 
Greene 

explained. 
“We 
believe 

that if you are a student 
of an underrepresented 
community, 
having 

student organizations be 
more inclusive will be a 
legitimate 
and 
genuine 

step in the right direction 
for 
improving 
campus 

culture.”

As Greene explained, a key 

part of the Inclusivity Project is 
a demographic survey that will 
be conducted within the next 
several weeks.

“We’re going to start working 

alongside student organizations 
to build a pseudo-DEI plan for 
their organizations,” he said. 
“We want to analyze current 
cultural procedures internally, 
look at barriers to participation 
and the inclusivity of all visible 
and invisible identities, and 
then loop back around and 
provide 
organizations 
with 

recommendations for short term 
and long term strategic plans.”

Greene 
expressed 
plans 

for continued evaluation of 
the 
inclusivity 
policies 
of 

Central Student Government 
itself 
through 
CSG’s 

yearly 
demographic 
survey. 

Surveys past have found the 
body to be from predominantly 
higher-income 
backgrounds, 

and assemblies historically have 
been made up of a majority white 
students. 

“It’s critical to ensuring the 

inclusivity and representation 
within

Student 

Government

CAMPUS ORCHESTR A

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: THOUSANDS RALLY FOR CHOICE IN D.C.: STUDENTS 
MAKE TREK TO JOIN IN PROTEST

As part of National Hunger 

and Homelessness Awareness 
Week, 
Michigan 
Movement 

and 
the 
Shelter 
Association 

of Washtenaw County hosted 
a 
Campus 
Homelessness 

Awareness Day on the Diag at 
the University of Michigan on 
Tuesday to educate students on 
homelessness 
in 
Washtenaw 

County.

LSA 
sophomore 
Marissa 

Ernst, 
a 
member 
of 

Michigan Movement, a student-
run nonprofit organization that 
aims to provide aid to individuals 
in the community experiencing 
homelessness, 
explained 

Tuesday’s 
event 
worked 
to 

raise awareness around issues 
students might feel distant from.

“We’re 
trying 
to 
raise 

awareness 
for 
hunger 
and 

homelessness week because it’s 
a lot bigger of an issue in Ann 
Arbor than people really realize 
when they get distracted by 
student life,” Ernst said.

On Jan. 31, 2018, homeless 

service 
providers 
surveyed 

people in Washtenaw County 
experiencing 
homelessness 

as 
part 
of 
the 
Housing 

and 
Urban 
Development-

mandated Point-In-Time count. 
They found homelessness is 
down nearly 25 percent since 
2015, but nearly 300 people still 

experience 
homelessness 
in 

the county. Forty-five of those 
experiencing 
homelessness 

are under the age of 18, and 73 
families are homeless. 

In 
Michigan, 
over 
9,000 

people experience homelessness, 
and this number extends to 
more than 500,000 people in the 
United States. When looking at 
demographics of homelessness in 
Washtenaw County, the survey 
found African Americans are 
disproportionately more likely 
to 
experience 
homelessness. 

African Americans make up 
13 
percent 
of 
the 
county’s 

population, but total 48 percent 
in the homeless population. In 

2016, a report showed 342 people 
experienced 
homelessness 
in 

Washtenaw County. 

Tuesday’s event also provided 

information for students on 
how 
to 
get 
involved 
with 

organizations working to combat 
the issue of homelessness in the 
community. Local organizations 
listed 
include 
The 
Delonis 

Center, 
Groundcover 
News, 

Washtenaw Housing Alliance, 
Ozone House, Avalon Housing 
and Food Gatherers. On-campus 
organizations 
include 
Maize 

‘N Blue Cupboard, Michigan 
Affordability 
and 
Advocacy 

Coalition, UMSFP and Michigan 
Movement.

“Hear our voice, we want 

choice.”

This was the message hundreds 

of Ann Arbor residents and 
University students carried to 
Washington, 
D.C. 
yesterday, 

where they were joined by tens of 
thousands of demonstrators from 
around the world at an abortion 
rights rally to “mobilize for 
women’s lives.”

The crowd — which was 

estimated between 100,000 and 
300,000 people — filed towards 
the Lincoln Memorial in a scene 
reminiscent of the 1963 civil 
rights rally, when 250,000 people 
gathered at the same spot.

Echoing Martin Luther King’s 

“I have a dream” speech, Yard 
said, “Let freedom ring for all 
women.”

“We are here to petition the 

President, the Supreme Court, and 
the Congress to not overturn Roe 
v. Wade and to stop dismantling 
access to abortion,” Yard said.

“How ironic that as the Soviet 

Union throws off its shackles and 
the Berlin Wall comes tumbling 
down, 
President 
Bush 
would 

enslave the country and not allow 
a woman to have an abortion,” 
she said. “We will build a political 
army such that has never been 
seen before in this country for 
freedom for women in this land to 
choose.” 

Parts of the rally were aimed 

at future elections. “We have 
seen the effects of mobilizing 
pro-choice opinions in the recent 
elections in New York, New Jersey 
and Virginia, and now politicians 

are seeing it is a political liability 
to be anti-choice,” said Madeleine 
Hansen, president of Michigan 
NOW.

Politicians 
and 
entertainers 

spoke and sang voicing their pro-
choice opinions. “While the other 
side is bombing clinics, we’ll be 
electing candidates,” said Alan 
Cranston (D-California).

Many families and mother-

daughter teams attended the rally. 
“It is an important family issue,” 
said Linda Coselman of Ann 
Arbor, who was there with her two 
daughters.

In a wheelchair, wearing a straw 

hat with a coathanger attached, 
and holding the sign “Seniors 
nostalgic for choice,” Cybil Fisher 
sat in the front row at the rally 
with her daughter Rita Frydman.

CSG discusses new inclusivity project

offices that handle these cases 
and support all students to speak 
directly about the policies and 
procedures of our University.”

Elizabeth 
Seney, 
assistant 

director 
of 
the 
Office 
of 

Institutional 
Equity 
then 

described the role of OIE as a 
neutral party addressing concerns 
of 
discrimination 
violating 

University policies. She walked 
the 
audience 
through 
OIE’s 

general process of reaching out 
to the complainant to hear what 
next steps the complainant wants, 
whether that be an investigation or 
a disciplining of the respondent.

Seney said the reports OIE 

receives are often from a third 
party sharing information about 
an incident with a complainant and 
respondent. If the parties involved 
in the incident are anonymous, she 
said, OIE is restricted in what they 
can accomplish.

“We are limited in our ability to 

follow up based on the anonymity 
of that,” Seney said. “So I want to 
be totally transparent and I don’t 
want to sugarcoat this and say 
it’s fine to report anonymously 
because we can address it in the 
same way. We are limited. We don’t 
know who to reach out to get more 
information, we don’t know what 
the person wants to see happening 
with the information.”

Margie Pillsbury, a detective 

in the Division of Public Safety 
and Security, talked about the 
department’s reporting process, 
noting DPSS’s close ties to OIE in 
cases of sexual misconduct within 
the University.

“If a survivor decides to make 

a report to us, we work closely 
with OIE trying to reduce the 
implication of contacts and make 
it easier for survivors,” Pillsbury 
said.

Kaaren Williamsen, director 

of Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center, and Emily 
Hyssong, the Counseling and 

Psychological 
Services 
worker 

for the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance, spoke about how their 
organizations are confidential for 
survivors. SAPAC and CAPS focus 
mainly on support and giving 
people immediate help, they said.

Associate Dean of Students 

Sarah Daniels said the Dean of 
Students Office becomes involved 
in these matters because their 
goal is to ease the impact of 
anything that interrupts the lives 
of students, including matters 
of sexual misconduct. Daniels 
spoke of the supportive and 
protective measures the office 
offers to students involved in OIE 
investigations.

The majority of the event was 

devoted to audience questions. 
One audience member asked the 
panelists what they are doing to 
help students focus on educational 
opportunities 
or 
simply 
get 

through their days in spite of a 
sexual misconduct investigation. 
Seney responded, emphasizing 
her wish to make conditions for 
students better, but noting the 
limitations of the University.

“I don’t know that we can ever 

— just in full being realistic and 
transparency — I don’t know that 
any part of the University or the 
University as a whole can fully 
eliminate any negative impact for 
any sexual misconduct,” Seney 
said. “What we are trying our 
absolute hardest to do is to number 
one prevent it, and number two 
do the best we can on that second 
part.”

Seney also said this kind of work 

becomes more difficult in small 
environments such as the Music, 
Theatre & Dance School. Upon 
some pushback from the audience, 
Daniels explained the difficulty 
in accommodating students in a 
school where class options are 
limited.

“Measures 
can 
get 
more 

complicated when we have a 
smaller environment and a smaller 
community and fewer options,” 
Daniels said. “What I mean by that 
is when we’re looking at a school 

like LSA that has 15,000 students 
and a whole lot of majors and a 
whole lot of options, we’ve got 
choices.”

Multiple 
audience 
members 

asked about what the panelists’ 
offices could do to discipline 
faculty 
members 
making 

comments on cases or siding 
publicly with a respondent over 
a claimant. Williamsen said in 
these 
cases, 
students 
feeling 

uncomfortable about a faculty 
member’s comments could come to 
SAPAC to discuss their concerns.

“We do work with people 

confidentially with things like that 
all the time to figure that out and to 
figure out what do I do with this,” 
Williamsen said. “This doesn’t 
feel right, I don’t want to go to that 
class anymore, I don’t want to go 
to that space anymore, and I don’t 
have a word with this, but this is 
getting in the way of participating 
in my life.”

Toward the end of the question-

and-answer 
session, 
Seney 

highlighted her willingness to 
hear out concerns, questions and 
suggestions from students and 
faculty regarding the effectiveness 
of OIE’s system.

“I know that I can’t fix 

everything and for me, I recognize 
that, but I really encourage people 
to share their feedback and any 
concerns and ask any questions,” 
Seney said. “And I can assure you 
that I will always do my best to 
address those concerns.”

Mark Clague, associate dean 

for Academic and Student Affairs 
at the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance, echoed this sentiment, 
describing the school’s next steps 
in addressing student concerns. 
Clague announced the formation 
of a faculty and staff ally group, 
plans for a symposium centered 
on sexual misconduct in the 
performing arts and workshops 
with SAPAC relating to these 
issues.

“We want to talk to you about 

these issues,” Clague said. “We 
are 
mandatory 
reporters 
so 

when things are brought to us 

they go directly to OIE through 
the reporting forms. But we can 
help finesse this to the best of our 
abilities. We’re not perfect either 
… but we’re really trying hard to 
make a difference”

LSA freshman Andrew Gerace 

said he attended the event because 
of the prevalence of these issues 
within the University, something 
he became more aware of after 
reading The Daily’s articles on 
sexual misconduct issues within 
the School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance. He said he felt the panel 
was a step in the right direction, 
but there are still questions to be 
answered.

“I have more questions walking 

out than I did walking in,” Gerace 
said. “Me personally, I felt like 
many of the questions had to be 
re-asked because some of the 
answers seemed to be sliding off … 
Often people trying to slack away 
or avoid questions … Effectively, 
the question was more obvious 
than the answer we were given and 
so I feel concerned that there’s still 
more hidden in the shadows that 
I really need to learn more about 
whether it’s in this panel format or 
other situations, we really need to 
keep this dialogue going.”

Gerace said he looks forward to 

going to more events on this topic. 
He aims to hold the panelists and 
their offices to their words in order 
to better establish trust, he said.

“In 
the 
hope 
that 
more 

happen, I really am planning on 
working to hold the people that 
spoke here today accountable to 
their words because I think that 
they’re now, from a position of 
trust, telling us what their roles 
and responsibilities are, and I 
think that in the situations that 
occur where what they’ve told us 
is not the way it’s happening, it’s 
breaking our trust even further,” 
Gerace said. “I hope we all can 
work together to reform what’s 
been broken and move forward.”

“I think there’s something 

new that may be happening 
here,” Political Science prof. 
Vince Hutchings said to the 
audience Tuesday. Overall, the 
panel found that 2018, though 
not a presidential election, still 
revealed telling information on 
voter sentiment and behavior.

Hutchings 
was 
joined 
by 

Walter Mebane, a professor in the 
Department of Political Science, 
and Kenneth Goldstein, professor 
of Politics at the University of 
San Francisco. Each of them 
presented on their own niche 
of election analysis, to provide 
a commentary on effects of 
the elections on the future of 
American politics, specifically for 
the Democratic Party in 2020.

Goldstein 
presented 
an 

analysis of voter demographics 
based on categories such as 
gender, 
race 
or 
education, 

responding to the refrain of the 
“blue wave” Democrats predicted 
would win out in races. 

“The big question on everyone’s 

mind is, ‘Was this a wave?’” 
Goldstein said. “It feels wave-ish 
to me.”

Among independent voters, 

Goldstein noted, Democrats did 
better than Republicans for the 
first time since 2008. This kind of 
energy, he believes, is something 
that Democrats will attempt to 
duplicate in 2020 by campaigning 
heavily in states like Wisconsin, 
which 
Democratic 
candidate 

Hillary Clinton largely ignored 
in 2016.

Mebane presented next on 

“election forensics,” or the use of 
“statistical methods to determine 
whether the results of an election 
accurately reflect the intentions 
of the electors.” He analyzes 
Twitter users’ posts regarding 
the election.

“I 
liked 
hearing 
about 

Twitter,” LSA junior Sydney 
Moore said of the event. “There 
were a lot of young people there 
and that’s the medium a lot of us 
use so I thought that was very 
interesting.”

LSA junior Alexis Miettinen 

appreciated the fact that despite a 
generational difference, scholars 
can acknowledge the salient 
influence social media has on U.S. 
voters.

“I think it’s interesting to see 

academic people who aren’t really 
into that realize how important it 
is in elections and in daily life,” 
Miettinen said.

Due to social media users’ 

inclination 
to 
surround 

themselves with others who 
are like-minded, Mebane said, 
“people aren’t even seeing the 
same world.” He calls this tunnel 
vision a “communication silo.”

“I don’t expect that that source 

of this polarization is going to 
go away any time soon,” Mebane 
said.

As 
the 
final 
presenter, 

Hutchings brought attention to 
the fact that though Democratic 
support undoubtedly increased 
in this year’s election, the extra 
push came from younger and 
more educated voters, rather 
than women or racial minorities 
as many would have thought or 
predicted. In Ann Arbor, campus 
precincts cast 4,977 votes last 
week, up from 1,541 votes in the 
2014 midterms.

It is surprises like these, the 

panelists agreed, that show just 
how important it is to have a 
conversation following elections 
about what happened and how 
it should be addressed moving 
forward.

“Elections 
are 
about 

narratives,” 
Goldstein 
said. 

“And the narratives and trends 
influence 
how 
our 
elected 

officials govern in the future.”

“Our goal at Ross and in 

the world when talking about 
diversity is to really normalize 
the 
conversation,” 
Petryk 

said. 
“All 
those 
identities 

who make up who we are 
and really being able to apply 
them 
into 
the 
conversation 

because sometimes, especially 
at Ross, it can be scary to 
even acknowledge or identify 
ourselves.”

Panelists discussed equity 

and inclusion in the workplace 
and 
the 
current 
business 

sustainability 
landscape 

for 
communities 
of 
color, 

LGBTQ employees and other 
marginalized 
groups. 
The 

panelists 
all 
noted 
their 

personal identities and the role 
they play in their work.

For 
Brown-West, 
she 

discussed how her surroundings 
as a child were homogeneous. 

She said it wasn’t until later in 
her career that she found her 
voice in her professional life. 
She also said while the employee 
pool 
remains 
predominantly 

white, 
she 
has 
noticed 
a 

progression toward inclusivity 
and less gender inequality as 
well as an added emphasis on 
sustainability in the business 
world.

Brown-West also said there 

were certain people — whom 
she called her “angels” — who 
helped her feel included while 
she was starting out in her 
career. Now, in her current 
position, she tries to help others 
feel the same way.

“Growing up feeling like the 

odd one out in many places that 
I was navigating, it’s helped 
me make sure that people feel 
as if they have this space to 

actually speak,” Brown-West 
said. “If we’re going to be able 
to actually solve some of these 
environmental 
challenges 
… 

we’re going to need a whole 
range of different experiences, 
of different backgrounds, of 
different points of view to come 
up with solutions because the 
solutions that we’ve had to date 
are not going to help us resolve 
these problems.”

Patten shared a formative 

experience 
from 
a 
former 

job during which a higher-
level 
employee 
told 
her 

that 
her 
natural 
hair 
was 

“inappropriate” for the work 
environment. She said it was in 
this situation she first realized 
the impact of her identity in her 
work life.

She 
said 
this 
experience 

has stuck with her and was 
part of her inspiration for 
forming DāO . An acronym for 
“Defy All Odds,” Patten said 
two of DāO ’s core values are 
creating products for everyone 
and reflecting the diversity 
seen in Detroit, where DāO is 
headquartered.

One thing Patten said was 

she felt like she could never 
feel like herself in corporate 
environments. She said people 
who 
looked 
like 
her 
were 

normally 
considered 
the 

people receiving philanthropic 
help 
rather 
than 
making 

the decisions on the other 
end. In the same vein, she 
touched on current notions 
to include “fake” diversity in 
marketing to attract customers 
rather than including diverse 
employees in the company and 
actually speaking to minority 
consumers.

“One 
of 
our 
hashtags 

or our phrases we use in 
DāO is ‘Own your identity,’ 
really encouraging not only 
us 
as 
founders, 
but 
even 

our 
customers 
to 
question 

everything,” 
Patten 
said. 

“It’s really important to have 
different voices and we really 
wanted it to reflect Detroit.”

Rackham student Katherine 

Cunningham said she attended 
because 
these 
overarching 

issues 
of 
environmentalism 

predominantly affect minorities 
and there is a need for greater 
understanding of identities and 
diversity to be able to create 
positive change.

“When it comes to big issues 

like climate change, the impacts 
are 
disproportionately 
on 

minorities and marginalized 

communities and it’s really 
important for people who are 
aspiring to work in this field to 
be aware of the different lenses 
that they need to approach this 
topic and other sustainability 
topics,” Cunningham said. “The 
idea of needing to know who 
you are and come back to your 
own roots so that you can do 
your work better, that resonated 
with me a lot.”

Patten said consumers like 

when brands are eco-friendly 
because it adds a feeling of 
empowerment. Hwang agreed, 
saying her experience at the 
footwear company TOMS, and 
now Thousand, taught her there 
does not have to be a trade-
off 
between 
environmental 

sustainability 
and 
revenue 

and product success. Hwang, 
Patten 
and 
Brown-West 
all 

agreed there are economic and 
other benefits such as social 
equality and added awareness 
in incorporating sustainability 
into business and production.

Hwang started her company 

to save lives after a friend died 
from a biking accident. She said 
at one point she was approached 
about sharing her background 
and rise to business leadership, 
but she said she didn’t feel 
relatable because her identity 
differed from the norm. Since 
then, she said she has come to 
understand her diversity is a 
benefit rather than a hindrance.

“I don’t look like everyone 

else who I have viewed as a 
founder,” Hwang said. “Being 
a good-looking white guy — 
not that. Diversity matters in 
the sense that you can come to 
better business decisions.”

At the conclusion of the 

discussion, all three panelists 
encouraged 
attendees 
to 

own 
their 
identities 
and 

be 
comfortable 
in 
their 
 

skin. They also said while 
minorities may feel like they are 
a low-power position right off 
the bat, they should realize the 
value in differences and what 
they bring to the table.

“My biggest advice is — 

especially when you are in 
this 
room 
that 
feels 
very 

intimidating — remember why 
you deserve to be there,” Brown-
West said. “Remember what 
value you bring. Remember 
that 
your 
experiences 
can 

add to that conversation and 
your way of thinking can add 
 

to that conversation, and that 
will help build this cocoon of 
confidence around you.”

in order to justify displacing 
indigenous people and excluding 
non-white aliens.” Another goal 
of the teach-in was to change the 
way people view immigration as a 
whole, shifting the framing from 
a legal issue to a moral issue and 
stressing a historical approach to 
how we view immigration.

This 
event 
was 
proposed 

in light of a lecture scheduled 
for Nov. 15 hosted by the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans 
with 
Mark 

Krikorian, the director of the 
Center for Immigration Studies, 
titled “The Real Immigration 
Debate: Whom to Let In and 
Why.” Some at the University, 
like postdoctoral fellow William 
Lopez, 
have 
taken 
issue 
 

with 
the 
event. 
Krikorian’s 

organization, 
which 
was 

founded in 1985 by University 
alum John Tanton, has been 
designated a hate group by 
the 
Southern 
Poverty 
Law 

Center, and the Latino/a Studies 
Department wanted to approach 
the conversation surrounding 
immigration from a different lens.

A 
panel 
composed 
of 

undergraduate 
and 
graduate 

University students discussed 
recent changes in immigration 
policies and public reception 
to these policies, the most 
pressing issues in immigration, 
and 
some 
immediate 
and 

long-term solutions to these 
problems. The panelists’ areas of 
expertise ranged from refugee 
policy to border control to the 
politicization of undocumented 
immigrants.

Panelist 
Nicolas 
Espinosa, 

a Ph.D. candidate, said while 
anti-immigration 
narratives 

supported by CIS are becoming 
“more 
aggressive 
and 
more 

blatant since pre-2016,” they 
aren’t necessarily new.

“We’ve seen this historically,” 

Espinosa said. “There’s always 
been a pretty significant anti-
immigrant 
movement, 
this 

effort from folks like CIS to 
paint immigrants as folks who 
are dangerous, or taking jobs, 
or exploiting the system. The 
narratives are just kind of being 
re-canned … That’s not to say that 
they didn’t exist before, they’re 
just becoming more intense and 
more out in the open.”

Panelist junior Ayah Kutmah, 

an LSA junior, said the current 
political narrative is that we are 
letting in too many refugees, 
when “in reality, (the United 

States is) not letting in people who 
should be considered refugees, 
pointing to the years-long process 
most refugees must go through to 
come to the United States.

“The 
backlog 
in 
refugee 

cases, the fact that it takes two 
 

years for a refugee case to 
be decided to be admitted to 
the United States … is against 
refugees,” Kutmah, who worked 
at Human Rights Watch over the 
summer, said. “The fact that from 
the moment they set foot in the 
United States, they incur the debt 
of the plane tickets, that’s huge.”

Peña said one of the biggest 

problems related to immigration 
in the U.S. was Border Patrol’s 
inhumane 
treatment 
of 

immigrants who cross the border 
at Mexico. 

“(Immigrants) 
are 
fleeing 

violence, 
gangs 
threatening 

their lives and domestic violence 
issues over there and so a lot of 
the women are fleeing from that 
… and so they’re suffering from 
a lot of trauma and PTSD (post-
traumatic stress disorder), like 
they break down in tears and 
forget what they’re talking about 
and stuff like that,” Peña said. 
“But because of border patrol, like 
the way they treat them, they add 
to the PTSD that they are already 
suffering from.”

identify where we’re having 
shortcomings in terms of the 
communities 
and 
parts 
of 

campus we represent,” Greene 
said.

Later 
in 
the 
meeting, 

representatives in attendance 
were 
invited 
to 
discuss 

resolutions 
proposed 
by 

members of student government.

One CSG member, Rackham 

student 
Nicholas 
Fadanelli, 

proposed 
amending 
the 

Statement of Students’ Rights 
of the Office of Student Conflict 
Resolution in order to clarify 
students’ rights in dealing with 
OSCR.

“The Statement of Students’ 

Rights is what OSCR uses when 
it comes to dealing with students 
who break University policies,” 
Fadanelli said. “To amend the 
statement 
of 
student 
rights 

would allow OSCR to better deal 
with these issues.”

Following 
Fadanelli’s 

comments, 
his 
resolution 

was voted on by members in 
attendance and advanced to the 
CSG rules committee for final 
approval.

While 
several 
resolutions 

were advanced to the committee 
for approval, only one proposal, 
A.R. 8-320, titled “A Resolution 
to 
Require 
SOFC 
Fund 

Recipients to Use Compostable 
Dining Materials,” was fully 
enacted.

CSG representative Michael 

Nwansi, 
an 
Engineering 

senior, was the author of the 
adopted resolution, which will 
take effect at the start of the 
winter 
semester. 
According 

to Nwansi, the success of the 
plan is contingent upon the 
cooperation of two University 
organizations: 
the 
Student 

Sustainability Initiative and the 
Student Organization Funding 
Committee.

“SOFC gives away a lot of 

funds to student orgs to help 
them fund their events,” Nwansi 
said. “SSI is a service on campus 
that gives free compostable 
materials 
to 
students. 
My 

resolution mandates that orgs 

applying for money from SOFC 
have to use those compostable 
materials at their events.”

According to Nwansi, the 

proposal hopefully will have 
a measurable impact on the 
environmental 
consciousness 

and 
sustainability 
of 
the 

University as a whole without 
being a burden on student 
groups.

“I sat down with the SOFC 

chairs to think through how 
this 
would 
work,” 
Nwansi 

said. “We decided that in their 
record keeping there will be a 
tab where they would record 
if organizations applied for 
compostable materials or not.”

Because 
the 
resolution 

will not be implemented until 
January, 
Nwansi 
explained 

there is still time for SOFC to 
determine how it will carry out 
the policy.

“This requirement won’t take 

effect until the beginning of next 
semester,” Nwansi said. “They’ll 
have some more leeway and time 
to change things if they find a 
smarter or more efficient way to 
deal with the logistics.”

I 
 

have had a smartphone since 
I was 13 years old. And before 
that, I had an iPod Touch that, 
with the will of a Wi-Fi connection, 
gave me consistent access to the 
Internet. So for at least the last eight 
years, I have been the owner of some 
type of smart device. And while I 
have always considered myself a 
responsible person and taken care 
of these devices, sometimes things 
happen outside of your control. For 
example, you could hypothetically 
fall down the stairs with your phone 
in your back pocket, affecting the 
already-cracked screen and causing 
the display to give out about a week 
later. Hypothetically.
But regardless of the many ways 
I could have hypothetically broken 
my phone, it happened. I went to 
pick it up, check the time and see if 
any new notifications had graced 
my screen, but was met with an 
unresponsive device. I got slightly 
irritated. And after 40 minutes of 
trying different methods of getting 
it to turn on, my frustration turned 
to panic and I borrowed a friend’s 
phone to call my parents.
I explained the situation quickly 
and with the anxious breath of 
someone in the midst of a crisis at 
12:30 a.m., my parents agreeing to 
figure it out in the morning. They 
did handle it, which I am extremely 
grateful for, but the process left 
me phoneless for two days. I was 
disconnected, apart from my old 
Dell laptop which, bless its soul, 
is on its last leg of life and needs to 
be constantly charging in order to 
work. And I know that two days 
may not seem like a long time, but 
try and give up your phone and 
Apple account for a few days to see 
the effects. It was just enough time 
to make me evaluate my technology 
use and the way that it has become 
central to the way I live.
I initially reflected on my reaction 
to breaking my phone in the first 
place. Imagine the feeling you have 
when you misplaced your phone 
for 10 minutes and are scouring the 
room for it, and amplify that by 10. 
I was filled with anxiety, as though 
I had just lost a hand. Phones and 
mobile communication have become 
so ingrained in and connected to us 
that any misplacement of the device 
is devastating to our day-to-day 
functionality and comfort. When it 
was taken away, I became acutely 
aware of this relationship.
I was quickly met with a set of 
challenges that I did not anticipate 
having. Without my phone I 

realized I did not have an alarm 
clock, affecting how I woke up for 
class over the next few days. I do 
not wear or even own a watch and 
have always used my phone as my 
personal tracker of time. For two 
days I only had a rough estimate 
of what time it was. Phones have 
pulled so many basic technologies 
together into one device, foregoing 
some uses that I did not even realize 
I frequently needed. This intensifies 
our tech reliance: So much of what 
we need and do is based on one 
device. Losing it is like losing what 
used to be 15 of your most useful 
objects.
I found myself on several 
occasions reaching for something 
that was not there. I would be 
studying and suddenly grab for 
the empty table to my right. Think 
about how many times you pick 
up your phone, even if you are not 
actively scrolling or using it. It has 
been reported that millennials 
check their phones 150 times a 
day. Something so habitual truly 
becomes essential to the way you go 
through your life, even when it is not 
necessarily beneficial to you.
Yet, in this disconnect I found 
that without minute breaks in my 
studying and working, I was more 
productive. My concentration was 
not interrupted by sending a quick 
message to a friend, or reading the 
headline that the New York Times 
sent to my notification center. 
This break in our concentration 
flow is proven to cause issues 
with productivity. However, I still 
missed my five-minute social media 
breaks. I was not Snapchatting or 
seeing the top new tweets on my 
feed. I felt like I was not expressing 
myself as regularly as I normally 
do, and I felt a distance from the 
people I frequently chat with. 
Communication has manifested 
itself in so many different ways in the 
age of social media, and a break from 
it felt isolating. While this cultural 
phenomenon of being “plugged in” 
all the time can have a distracting 
quality, it is the way that information, 
ideas and expression are shared 
in our society, so disconnecting 
can make us feel as if we are 
missing 
something. 
Managing 
and balancing our screen time is 
something that we could benefit 
from in practical ways, especially 
when tech usage manifests into 
insignificant scrolling and wasting 
time. But cutting it out completely 
or resisting its importance in our 
new communication system is an 

intractable mindset. 
The consistent access to and 
use of our phones, in combination 
with the fact that 77 percent of 
Americans now own a smartphone 
(95 percent owning some type of 
cell phone), keeps us connected to 
not only technology, but to each 
other. Mobile communication has 
given humanity, for the first time, 
instantaneous access to the people 
in our lives at any point. This is a 
new cultural phenomenon that is 
criticized but also indulged in by our 
society. While we may feel that we 
do not owe anyone a timely response 
to whatever they may need, due 
to the rapid nature of information 
that we are so accustomed to, we 
oftentimes expect it from others. 
My first phoneless day left many 
of my friends confused until they 
saw me in the evening. They were 
not given the typical daily updates 
of where I was and what I was 
doing. These interactions, while 
typically short, give us a constant 
access to one another that has never 
before existed. It also has created a 
certain level of anxiety about where 
people are and what they are doing. 
Without these habitual updates, 
loved ones can be sent into a frenzy 
of concern. When you do not check 
in, it implies that something is off or 
wrong. It’s crucial to maintaining 
interpersonal connections.
Millennials 
are 
the 
first 
generation to grow up in an age 
of mobile communication. This 
is reflected greatly in our use of 
technology and the importance that 
it plays in our daily lives. Phones 
have become an extension of us, 
both a useful tool for many day-to-
day functions and a way to intensify 
interpersonal communication. But 
alongside the growth of constant 
access to one another and the use 
of devices, tech reliance has also 
developed — a new dependence that 
people of other generations may not 
be able to understand. A reliance 
that should be better managed in 
order to inspire productivity.
After my parents brought me 
my new phone, I asked them how 
they used to make and keep plans, 
how they handled communication 
without cell phones. “Erin, we 
just did it!” And as with all new 
advancements, we just keep doing 
it. Cell phones are just the new “it.”

O 

n its surface, Netflix’s 
“Bojack 
Horseman” 
simply looks like an 
absurd cartoon about a celebrity 
horse, 
but 
anyone 
who 
has 
seen the show can attest that 
its themes extend far past just 
whimsical animal puns (though 
they are admittedly some of 
my favorite parts of the show). 
Despite centering around the lives 
of 
mostly 
anthropomorphized 
animals, “Bojack Horseman” is 
perhaps the most honest portrayal 
of the human condition currently 
on television, and its most recent 
season fearlessly explores the 
complex facets of addiction, the 
marginalization of women and 
the lack of accountability in our 
society.
Season 
five 
of 
“Bojack 
Horseman” follows Bojack as 
he balances a demanding acting 
job on the set of his new action 
drama “Philbert” with growing 
depression and drug addiction. 
This season focuses largely on the 
theme of accountability, or more 
specifically, a lack thereof. We 
get a taste of this early on with 
Vance Waggoner, a remorseless 
former “Hollywood” star who 
has a history of horrible behavior 
involving 
sexual 
harassment, 
assault and anti-Semitism. After 
a few years out of the spotlight, 
Vance lands a gig as Bojack’s 
co-star on “Philbert,” a role that 
is meant to revive the “reformed” 
actor’s career.
Though as viewers we can 
laugh at Vance’s excessively dark 
and endless transgressions, we 
must also recognize that Vance 
is just an exaggerated version of 
the celebrities and public figures 
whom we constantly forgive in 
our society. This cycle is one we 
all know far too well — a celebrity 
scandal 
breaks 
the 
celebrity 
apologizes and spends some time 
out of the public eye and shortly 
after, the public welcomes the 
“new-and-improved” 
celebrity 

back with open arms.
Waggoner’s 
character 
holds 
obvious relevance to the #MeToo 
movement that has taken our 
society by storm. With so many 
once-beloved 
public 
figures 
shockingly exposed as sexual 
assaulters and harassers, a number 
of them have inevitably slipped 
through the cracks back into the 
public’s warm embrace. Perhaps 
most notably, Louis C.K., who just 
last year was at the center of the 
#MeToo movement, and has now 
already kickstarted a return to the 
stand-up stage. It is instances like 
these that reveal just how fickle the 
public is. Louis C.K. is funny and 
affable, so naturally, mere months 
after we discovered his history 
of sexual misconduct, we have 
already begun to forget.
Though 
Vance 
Waggoner’s 
character 
is 
a 
blunt 
social 
commentary on society’s inability 
to hold the rich and famous 
accountable, it is merely a precursor 
to the season’s much darker 
climactic 
ending. 
Throughout 
the season, we witness Bojack 
gradually spiraling out of control 
as his dependency on painkillers 
takes over his life. Eventually, his 
sense of self becomes so warped 
that he mistakes a scripted action 
scene for real life and violently 
chokes his co-star Gina while 
filming. Not wanting her best 
shot at a successful acting career 
to die in the shadow of such a 
massive scandal, Gina publically 
“clears things up” in an interview, 
covering her bruises with makeup 
and assuring the public that it was 
just good acting.
This 
interview 
scene 
is 
incredibly honest and powerful. 
Not only does Gina illustrate 
an 
often 
overlooked 
barrier 
to 
survivors 
of 
assault 
who 
contemplate coming forward, but 
the situation also represents a very 
real instance in which a powerful and 
destructive force once again escapes 
the consequences of his actions.

There 
is 
a 
scene 
in 
the 
10th episode in which Bojack 
rationalizes that everybody does 
regrettable things, that, “We’re all 
terrible, so, therefore, we’re all OK.” 
This quote embodies every reason 
our society habitually fails to hold 
people accountable. We adopt 
this mindset because it is easy. It 
is easy to believe that, “We’re all 
terrible, so, therefore, we’re all OK” 
because a lack of agency means 
that we never had any control over 
our actions in the first place. It 
means that we are not responsible 
for ourselves, so, therefore, our 
transgressions are not our fault. 
These rationalizations are simply 
coping mechanisms. But in this 
case, we cannot just cope — we 
must respond.
With the #MeToo movement in 
full force, I can only hope that we 
as a society have begun to realize 
that we must hold others as well as 
ourselves truly accountable. The 
trauma suffered by survivors of 
sexual assault is too painful for us 
to remain complacent. We cannot 
simply rationalize wrongdoings 
with the same old justifications 
like “Boys will be boys” or “It’s just 
locker room talk” because these 
excuses normalize attitudes and 
beliefs which should unequivocally 
be condemned. An apology is not 
enough to warrant forgiveness 
because redemption is not a binary 
state, but instead a gradual and 
continuous effort. Yes, we all do 
terrible things sometimes, but 
this fact is not some equalizer that 
justifies all wrongdoings.
Season 
five 
of 
“Bojack 
Horseman” closes on a hopeful 
note as Bojack checks himself 
into a rehabilitation facility for his 
addiction. He realizes the changes 
he himself must enact in order to 
be better — it’s time society does 
the same.

S

ignatories 
to 
the 
recent 
statement 
criticizing 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
decision to discipline Prof. John 
Cheney-Lippold for refusing to 
support a student who wanted to 
study in Israel framed the issue 
solely in terms of freedom of 
speech. In fact, two principles were 
in contention: a professor’s right to 
express his views and a student’s 
right to study at an institution of 
her choosing. Since the University 
believes its primary commitment 
must be to students, and since 
Cheney-Lippold’s 
freedom 
in 
other contexts is unaffected, the 
University chose to support the 
undergraduate. The signatories, 
however, 
ignored 
the 
student 
entirely. Their statement mentioned 
the professor’s free speech rights 
four times — the young woman’s 
thwarted academic aspirations, not 
once.
I suspect, moreover, that the 
signatories’ commitment to freedom 
of speech is not absolute, but 
conditional and qualified. Suppose a 
professor refused to write for a woman 
who wanted to study physics because 
women can’t do science. Or suppose he 
refused to write for a student seeking 
to attend a Muslim university because, 
in his view, Muslims are terrorists. Or if 
no letter were provided for an African 
university because, in the professor’s 
opinion, African universities are 
academically inferior. All such actions 
are examples of free speech. But, if the 
University penalized the offending 
professor, I seriously doubt we’d see 
an outraged protest. Most signatories 
probably would stay silent or demand 
the administration chastise their 
ignorant colleague.
Insofar as this is true, the central 
issue is not freedom of speech at all, 
but political and historical analysis. 
 
Not all, but certainly many signatories 
support Prof. Cheney-Lippold because 
they share his sympathy for the 
Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions 
movement.
If the political claims of the BDS 
movement are central to the entire 
debate, what then can be said about 
their credibility? In all my classes, and 
especially my course on the Arab-
Israeli conflict, I go to great lengths 
to introduce divergent views and 
historiographic debates. But, it is 
precisely because I oppose simplistic, 
politically inspired interpretations 
that I now critique the BDS narrative. 
I hasten to add that I would do 
exactly the same if faculty petitions 
circulated in support of an ahistorical, 
exclusively pro-Israel perspective.
The BDS movement makes two 
chief claims. First, it says that Israel 
must be boycotted because it violates 
international norms of human rights. 
Indeed, in demanding sanctions 
against only one country, BDS 
suggests that Israel has the world’s 
worst human rights record. 
To be sure, within Israel, which 
defines 
itself 
as 
an 
expressly 
Jewish state, Arabs are second-
class citizens, with lower per capita 
funding and a pervasive sense of 
marginalization. 
Unfortunately, 
however, in privileging one ethnic 
or religious group, Israel resembles 
a great number, probably a majority, 
of U.N. member states. And if we 
consider not merely ethnic relations, 

but the totality of civic rights, Israel 
does far better than most. Arguably, 
the most respected global survey of 
minority rights and democracy is the 
Democracy Index compiled by the 
U.K.-based Economist Intelligence 
Unit. In this survey, which ranks 
countries from No. 1, most democratic 
(Norway), to No. 167, least democratic 
(North Korea), Israel ranks No. 30. 
Israel is in the same cohort as the U.S. 
(No. 21), France (No. 29), Belgium 
(No. 32), etc.
No other Middle East country 
ranks lower (i.e., better) than No. 
69, and the great majority come in 
at No. 100 or worse. The Palestinian 
territories, No. 108, have been 
condemned by Human Rights Watch 
for systematically torturing political 
prisoners. Neither the West Bank 
under the Palestinian Authority 
nor Gaza under Hamas offers any 
semblance of free elections, freedom 
of the press or tolerated dissent.

By contrast, Arab citizens of 
Israel have exactly the same civic 
and political rights as Jews. An 
Arab party is the third largest in 
parliament. Arabs serve on the 
Israeli Supreme Court, in the cabinet 
and in the army high command. 
They have equal access to all public 
institutions. Christian Arabs have 
higher rates of university enrollment 
and lower poverty rates than Jews. 
None of this remotely resembles 
apartheid South Africa, to which BDS 
leaders routinely compare Israel. So 
why does BDS single out Israel for 
censure, rather than Middle Eastern 
autocracies? I say nothing about 
the truly appalling human rights 
records of China, Russia, Sri Lanka, 
Venezuela, the Philippines, etc.
The second BDS claim is that 
outside Israel proper, in the West 
Bank 
and 
Gaza, 
settlements 
and security controls constitute 
outrageous abuses of an innocent 
population. I readily agree that 
Israel’s 
ongoing 
expansion 
of 
West Bank settlements is morally 
offensive and politically myopic.
Palestinians 
themselves, 
however, 
bear 
significant 
responsibility for these conditions. 
Their leaders have had many 
opportunities to end the conflict. 
But for almost a century, a 
combination of chronic political 
fragmentation 
and 
deep-seated 
popular anger over the Zionist 
intrusion into Arab lands has 
made it impossible for any leader 
to accept a permanent Jewish state 
without risking his political, indeed 
physical, demise. 
All told, from 1937 to 2014, 
eight international proposals to 
end the conflict were made. All 
would have given Palestinians 
control over substantial parts, 
in one case 100 percent, of the 

territories 
comprising 
modern 
Israel and Palestine, but all would 
have required compromise. Jews, 
not because they were more moral 
but because demographic realities 
curbed their appetite, accepted at 
least six, possibly seven, of these 
proposals. Most of what Palestinians 
now claim they want — including a 
West Bank state with its capital in 
East Jerusalem — was offered in 
these proposals. But opponents of 
any substantial Jewish presence 
rejected all eight proposals and 
accompanied those rejections with 
military and terrorist attacks. Jews 
responded with military measures 
designed to prevent fresh attacks. 
Those responses and the ensuing, 
progressive deterioration in the 
Palestinians’ territorial and political 
position only deepened Palestinian 
bitterness, which inspired fresh 
rounds of violence, which led to 
further Israeli restrictions in a 
downward spiral to which no end 
is in sight.
As a result, virtually everything of 
which Palestinians now complain — 
refugees in 1947-49, the West Bank 
occupation from 1967, settlements 
after 1977, the 2002 security wall, the 
post-2007 Gaza blockade — came 
in direct response to Arab-initiated 
violence whose instigators, with 
extensive popular support, were 
expressly committed to destroying the 
Jewish state.
Gaza illustrates this dynamic 
all too well. Despite the blockade, 
Gaza Hamas has managed to inflict 
considerable financial and political 
damage. But, the West Bank is 15 times 
larger than Gaza, far closer to Israel’s 
heartland and far more open to Iranian 
troops and weapons. Israelis fear that 
if they withdrew from the West Bank, 
Hamas — which is allied to Iran, sworn 
to Israel’s extermination and arguably 
the most popular Palestinian party — 
would take control of the West Bank 
just as they seized Gaza after Israel 
left. A Hamas-dominated West Bank, 
with Iranian troops and weapons 
next door to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, 
would threaten Israel’s very existence. 
No Israeli government — right or 
left — could ever countenance such 
a possibility. More than religious or 
ideological imperatives, this deep-
rooted existential fear now drives 
Israeli settlement expansion and 
suspicion of a two-state solution.
To be sure, Zionism presented the 
Arabs of Palestine with an extremely 
painful dilemma: In effect, they were 
asked to pay the price for European 
anti-Semitism for which they bore 
no responsibility. Nonetheless, faced 
with hard choices, Palestinians during 
the last hundred years responded in 
ways that often proved profoundly 
self-destructive. To accept the BDS 
image of Palestinians as victims 
of entirely gratuitous repression 
is to caricature history. And to 
single out Israel from among 193 
U.N. members as the country 
whose human rights record is most 
deserving of boycott is to defy 
impartial logic.

EVENT PREVIEW

From 
the 
moment 
Carlie 
Hanson walked into the golden-
yellow-painted 
dressing 
room 
in the rear of Detroit’s historic 
Fox Theater, any trace of tension 
vanished. She greeted me with 
a smile and open hug. She’s as 
relatable as can be: going off about 
astrology (she’s the most Taurus 
person you’ll ever meet), stanning 
Harry Styles, wondering what the 
hell Justin Bieber is doing, eating 
her feelings and figuring it all out 
as she goes.
At 18, she sits opposite me on the 
millennial / Gen-Z cultural border: 
loving Soundcloud artists, growing 
up on Usher’s Confessions and 
Justin Timberlake’s FutureSex/
LoveSounds and rebuking any 
labels, especially in terms of 
genre and sexuality. Hanson, who 
recently took a turn with Billboard 
Pride’s Instagram account, will be 
dropping an EP early next year and 
has begun infusing her traditional 
pop sound with rock-inspired 
guitars, undoubtedly primed by the 
Metallica and Five Finger Death 
Punch her mother played growing 
up in Wisconsin.
“I want to tell you all about (the 
EP) but I can’t. It talks about a long-
distance relationship I have with a 
girl. I’m still figuring it out myself. 
I don’t even know how to label my 
sexuality and I don’t know where I 
am. So, I don’t know how much I’ll 
put into my music but I don’t want 
to not talk about it,” she said during 
our conversation.
Hanson 
reminisces 
about 
her home life, grapples with her 
new life — in the studio, in L.A. 
and on the road — and does so 
with an infectious confidence, 
only revealing the magnitude of 
her achievements through the 
bewildered excitement in her voice. 
Her performance at The Fox last 
month was her first joining Troye 

Sivan on The Bloom Tour, fresh 
off a summer of making music in 
L.A., visiting friends in Wisconsin 
and playing a handful of festivals 
to get her feet wet. (By showtime, 
it’s clear she has already found her 
sea legs).
“Festivals aren’t my favorite 
right now because not a lot of 
people know me, so I’m definitely 
more for the sweaty venues and 
intimacy,” she said, sitting with her 
leg up on a fold-out chair opposite 
of my couch. “(The Fox is) so big I’m 
going to freak out. The ceiling and 
everything? Oh my god. Have you 
seen the Beyoncé and Jay-Z video? 
The one they shot in the … Louvre? 
Yes! It looks like that.”
She’s not wrong. As most of her 
friends from Wisconsin are about 
to end their first semester of college, 
Carlie has just ended the Bloom 
Tour. Hosting the back-to-back-
to-back queer, blonde ambition of 
Hanson, Kim Petras and Sivan, 
the historic Fox Theater’s intricate 
architecture 
reads 
as 
equally 
revolutionary and religious.
The singer’s synth-pop package 
is especially “of the moment.” She 
knows you think she looks like 
Billie Eilish. She knows you might 
even think she is Billie Eilish whose 
EP release party she attended last 
year. 
“I take that as a fucking 
compliment, she’s a badass … like 
damn, I’ll take it!” she said.
This year, she found herself on 
Taylor Swift’s personal playlist and 
moving to Los Angeles.
“I hated (L.A.) at first — well, not 
hated it — but (my apartment) was 
so bare and I don’t know how to 
build anything or make furniture, 
but (my best friend) Dale helped me 
build everything, and I love it now. 
It’s cozy,” she said of her studio.
She lights candles beneath 
Nirvana, “Call Me By Your Name” 
and Mac Miller posters. But despite 
the beach sunsets back-dropping 
her writing sessions, Hanson finds 
herself at a loss on how to make 

friends as an 18-year-old in the 
city without a fake ID, hoping to 
eventually get rich and move all of 
her friends out.
“Yeah, I definitely (feel lonely 
sometimes). It’s hard because I’ve 
lived with my family my whole life. 
Now I turn 18, and I’m all on my 
own. It’s such a weird transition,” 
Hanson said. “I have two sisters at 
home, older and younger and I have 
an older brother. He lives in Texas. 
Anyway but, it sucks being without 
them. My friends and I used to go 
hiking in the bluffs, I miss doing 
that. And I fucking miss driving. I 
miss my Toyota.”
Before picking up on the Bloom 
tour, Hanson opened for Jeremy 
Zucker on a club tour, making a 
stop at Ann Arbor’s own Blind Pig 
in September.
“I remember getting to the 
dressing room. I’m a huge Nirvana 
fan, and I was like I wonder if Kurt 
or someone signed the wall and I 
saw his name with the year ’91 and 
I went on YouTube and saw the 
video,” she said before clapping in 
a moment of clarity: “That was the 
concert where I had the moment! 
I came off stage and was like ‘holy 
fuck this is really what I’m doing?’ 
It happens really randomly and I 
think tonight it’s going to hit me 
too. I know Troye fans are just die-
hards,” she said. “I think tonight I’ll 
definitely feel that way.”
As we wrap up, she hugged me 
again, thanked me and with sincere 
excitement said: “That was so fun! 
It’s going to be a fun fucking show.”
She wasn’t wrong. Hanson’s 
strongest 
asset 
remains 
her 
personability, which exudes from 
her music and stage presence.
“I’m super excited to go back to 
(my apartment) and sleep after this 
tour,” she said, on the first night of 
the tour, but surprisingly has not 
been able to sleep since getting back 
(per her Instagram).
Carlie Hanson’s new single, 
“Toxins” is out now, and her EP is 
expected in early 2019.

Carlie Hanson is the most 
Taurus person you’ll meet

CARLIE HANSON

Ah, November. Many think 
of the first magical snowfall 
of the season with light traces 
of 
footprints 
crisscrossing 
through the frosted grass. 
Others may be reminded of 
the lengthy American holiday 
season and dash off to buy 
Christmas gifts for loved ones. 
More broody types may reflect 
only on the oncoming cold 
and how ill-prepared they are 
to receive its wrath. For me, 
November is all of these things 
plus one more: November is 
the month when the art scene 
in Ann Arbor explodes. 
If you’ve been toying with 
the idea of seeing a University 
production, now is the time 
to finally commit, pull on 
your snow boots and trudge 
over to the theater. Trust me, 
it’s a wonderful change from 
pulling on your beer-stained, 
lost-cause white sneakers and 
trekking over to a frat house. 
If dance is the art form that 
makes your heart sing, consider 
the School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance’s “hand&hand” senior 
BFA showcase. Senior BFA 
students 
Alyssa 
Gorman, 
Annelise Senkowski, Kandis 
DeAnne 
Terry 
and 
Amy 
Wensley will each showcase 
a group and solo work this 
weekend at the Betty Pease 
Studio Theater. Each piece 
highlights an aspect of their 
personal experience, either at 
the University or throughout 
their personal lives. 
Annelise Senkowski
Senkowski’s 
solo 
work 
focuses on the hiraeth, a 
Welsh word best translated 
to “a nostalgia for something 
that never was.” Senkowski’s 
theme draws heavily from 
her childhood, having left her 
home at the age of 14 to pursue 
professional Classical ballet 
training 
at 
the 
University 
of North Carolina School of 
the Arts. Now a senior at the 
University, 
Senkowski 
still 
feels like the “home” she’s 
nostalgic for isn’t a location in 
the world. 
“When I go home, it doesn’t 
feel like the place where I 
should relax, rest and sink my 
feet into the ground. I dream 
of that feeling of settlement 
that comes when your plane 
lands and you’re home, but 
I don’t really have that,” 
Senkowski said. 
But she’s not regretful. 

“I want the audience to 
acknowledge that there’s a 
hole in everyone,” Senkowski 
said. 
Any type of longing naturally 
leads to a feeling of isolation, 
and Senkowski has chosen to 
link her solo work with her 
group work on the isolation 
of women, specifically within 
relationships. She pressed the 
importance of women lifting 
each other up to combat this 
isolation. 

“We’ve always fought to 
have a place at the table, but 
we’ve got to get rid of the 
notion that there’s only one 
place for women. We can all 
have a seat at the table, we 
just need to help each other,” 
Senkowski said. 
Kandis DeAnne Terry 
Terry’s work is focused on 
the importance of healing, and 
her vehicle to do so is color. 
She embraces color therapy as 
a way to accept the energies of 
others while being cognizant 
of how our individual energies 
enhance the bigger picture. 
“Our (energies), just like 
our bodies, are made up of 
many parts and colors, seven 
to be exact. Violet, Indigo, 
Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, 
& Red,” Terry said in an email 
interview with The Daily. 
Terry sees each of these 
colors as associated with a 
particular 
chakra. 
Violet, 
for example, is the chakra 
associated with naturalistic 
instincts. The green chakra 
fuels 
one’s 
connection 
with 
others. 
Terry 
sees 
these 
chakras, 
and 
their 
corresponding 
colors, 
as 
integral 
to 
understanding 
herself. 
“I have found that each of 
my energy chakras matter. 
Each is unique and have their 
own function and key to 
healing. Although one chakra 
may be stronger or channeled 

more often than the other, 
does not mean the rest are 
not just as useful or needed,” 
Terry wrote. 
Alyssa Gorman 
Gorman puts her finger 
on the moment every college 
student can relate to — the 
feeling 
of 
being 
torn 
in 
different directions, crushed 
by expectations from every 
facet of life. 
“As I am graduating in one 
month, I have found myself 
constantly looking for the 
next thing (job, opportunity, 
audition, etc.) instead of living 
in 
the 
moment,” 
Gorman 
wrote in an email interview 
with The Daily. 
Like many others, Gorman 
has found her community to be 
an incredible support system 
to find her inner peace in the 
face of this chaos. 
“To have a group of people 
to cheer you on and build up 
through the highs and the 
lows is so important to your 
physical, mental, and spiritual 
well-being,” Gorman wrote. 
Gorman 
will 
use 
contemporary jazz to bring her 
experiences to light on stage. 
Amy Wensley 
Projecting your energy on 
the outside world can be just 
as important as focusing on 
yourself, especially with the 
rampant effects of climate 
change 
already 
seen 
and 
those to come. Wensley uses 
movement to highlight the 
importance of caring for the 
world that we inhabit. 
“In 
regards 
to 
the 
environment, in some ways, 
we’re improving, and in some 
ways, we’re lacking,” Wensley 
wrote in an email interview 
with The Daily. 
Wensley’s 
group 
work 
focuses 
on 
the 
theme 
of 
migration, 
specifically 
of 
ethnic 
groups 
around 
the 
world. Her ideas stem from 
migrations in her own family. 
“My theme of ‘migration’ 
stemmed from research about 
my 
multicultural 
heritage: 
my 
96-year-old 
grandpa’s 
challenges in the 1930s-50s 
with 
his 
Native 
American 
roots, my late grandfather who 
immigrated from Malta in the 
1950s, and my first-generation 
American mother growing up 
in 
metro-Detroit,” 
Wensley 
wrote. 
All 
choreographers 
will 
present 
their 
works 
from 
Thurs. Nov. 15 to Sat. Nov. 
17 at the Betty Pease Studio 
Theater. 

LeBron James takes his 
talents to the small screen

HBO

This year, LeBron James 
opened a public elementary 
school in his native Akron, 
traded 
barbs 
with 
the 
president of the United States, 
did voiceover work for the 
animated film “Smallfoot” (he 
was not Meechee), endorsed 

Texas Senate candidate Beto 
O’Rourke, wore a fabulous 
Thom Browne short suit, did a 
shot of tequila with no hands on 
“The Ellen Show” (for charity) 
and had producing credits on 
no fewer than five television 
shows and sold another four to 
networks. Oh, and in his free 
time, he played some basketball.
The King is now as exciting 
to watch off the court as he is to 

watch on it. Whatever led James 
to join the Lakers this summer 
— the renown of the franchise, 
Magic Johnson’s persistence, a 
championship-hungry 
young 
core — the move to Los Angeles 
positions him to be a player in 
the entertainment industry, in 
the off-season and in eventual 
retirement. And James has,

feels tied to him in some way. 
Collectively, they tell a kind of 
extratextual story of an athlete 
at the culmination of his own 
political 
awakening, 
deeply 
curious about the institutions 
and forces that have made his 
life what it is.
Showtime’s 
“Shut 
Up 
and 
Dribble,” 
a 
three-part 
docuseries airing this month, 
is an attempt to place James’s 
activism 
in 
a 
historical 
tradition. A sweeping history 
of political activism in the 
NBA, 
the 
program’s 
title 
is a cheeky jab at the Fox 
News 
anchorwoman 
Laura 
Ingraham, 
who 
made 
the 
remark in February after James 
criticized Donald Trump in 
an ESPN interview. “Shut Up 
and Dribble” is also a rebuke 
to anyone who would neglect 
the fraught racial and power 
dynamics tied up in basketball 
by calling it “just a game.”
“In America, Black athletes 
were 
supposed 
to 
be 
the 
workers, 
not 
the 
owners,” 
narrates sportswriter Jemele 
Hill in the first episode’s 
opening minutes. “They were 
supposed to be the talent and 

never 
the 
power 
brokers.” 
It’s a reminder of how radical 
James’s TV empire is — it 
marks his ability to bridge that 
gap, to take ownership of his 
future at a time when the NBA’s 
stars are beginning to wield 
unprecedented power.
Any discussion of LeBron 
James 
will 
be 
met 
with 
inevitable 
comparisons 
to 
Michael Jordan, who parlayed 
his 
NBA 
success 
into 
his 
own commercial empire and 
whose number James wears 
in homage. But James has 
taken 
care 
to 
distinguish 
himself 
from 
Jordan. 
The 
second episode of “Shut Up 
and Dribble” critiques Jordan’s 
silence on social issues. When 
declining to endorse the Black 
Harvey Gantt in his Senate 
race against the openly racist 
Jesse 
Helms, 
Jordan 
said, 
famously — if apocryphally — 
that “Republicans buy sneakers 
too.” Jordan’s story is told 
alongside those of forgotten 
athletes who gambled their 
careers 
on 
their 
political 
convictions and lost. “Maybe 
the best way to stay popular is 
to remain a mystery,” says Hill.
James 
doesn’t 
buy 
that. 
“The Shop,” a freewheeling 
barbershop-set group talk show 
on HBO, is proof of his belief 
that celebrity obliges him to be 
outspoken. With fellow NBA 
and WNBA players, comedians 
and rappers, he probes issues 
of race, fatherhood and fame. 
Is it 100 percent authentic? 

Probably not — it’s TV, after 
all. But it feels like earnest 
conversation amid the joking 
there are a few moments of 
real insight. Jordan is invoked 
here too: In one episode, Eagles 
defensive end Michael Bennett 
recalls “looking for Michael 
Jordan to say something, and 
he never did.”
The shows James doesn’t 
make 
appearances 
in 
are 
equally bold and compelling. 
“Warriors of Liberty City” 
on Starz follows a Miami 
neighborhood where a career 
in the NFL is seen as the only 
way out. “Student Athlete” on 
HBO is a critical look at the 
maze of NCAA rules. And the 
scripted shows in production 
will venture outside the world 
of sports — Netflix is making a 
SpringHill series about Madam 
CJ Walker, America’s first 
Black female millionaire, with 
Octavia Spencer (“The Help”) 
set to star.
Who better to make TV than 
someone 
who 
has 
publicly 
grappled with spending the 
majority of his life in the 
spotlight in front of a camera? 
In a sense, James is the 
rare child star who endured 
the 
lifetime 
of 
attention 
uncorrupted by fame. He has 
emerged from it all with a rare, 
keen understanding of what it 
means to be a public figure in 
2018. And in television, he may 
have finally found a meaningful 
vehicle to make sense of his 
strange world.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

What do you get when you 
simmer a pot of oatmeal on low 
heat, add a French minor, a dash 
of cinnamon, a drizzle of almond 
butter, an affinity for yoga and 
nearly fifty thousand Instagram 
followers? This is just one recipe in 
the cookbook of lovely ingredients 
that makes up LSA sophomore 
foodie Maddie Ross.
Ross or, as she’s known on 
her wildly popular health and 
wellness Instagram account, @
cest.madeleine is the human form 
of sunshine. Where some people 
hide behind their iPhone screens, 
scrolling with a looming cloud 
of doubt and self-destruction, 
comparing themselves to pixelated 
8-inch images of acquaintances 
and strangers, Ross is quite the 
opposite. In fact, she’s used her 
Instagram platform to express 
herself in a positive way. Where 
many use Instagram to alter who 
they are, she uses the social media 
app to get to the center of exactly 
who she is.
Her account is filled with 
encouraging, honest captions and 
gorgeous photographs of stacked 
avocado toasts, bowls of creamy 
oatmeal, pieces of grilled fish and 
white sweet potato fries grilled to 
perfection with a pool of earthy 
green pesto for dipping on the side. 
From experience, I can tell you that 
Ross’s cooking abilities and sunny 
disposition are anything but phony. 
In fact, the conversation I shared 
with her over homemade oatmeal 
bowls was blissfully authentic, 
peaceful and warm.
Against the wall of the quaint, 
chic kitchen she calls her own 
during the school year — decorated 
with a sign that reads “chop it like 
it’s hot” — I observed her in her 
element, standing over the stove, 
simmering banana slices on a 
pan sprayed with avocado oil and 
crackling with sweet maple syrup.
“I don’t mind that my bedroom 
is so small because I spend most 
of the time in here anyway,” She 
said with a smile, gesturing to her 
kitchen. “The kitchen is my happy 
place.”
She prodded at the browning 
bananas with a seemingly magical 
touch as the kitchen began to smell 
how a cold Sunday morning should. 
I could tell immediately that Ross 
feels her best in the kitchen — she 
traversed the space naturally, has a 
terrific handle on multitasking and 
created art out of bananas, oats, 
almond butter and granola. I never 
thought much about the magic 
touch of someone gifted at cooking 
until I had the chance to really 
watch someone with said touch in 
their element.
“Cooking and baking and then 
photographing my meals is like 
my art form,” she said when asked 
what her process is for sautéing, 
baking and mixing her delicious 
Instagram photos into life. “I 
normally go by what will look 
pretty and what will taste good too. 
I’ll admit it’s a little bit of both.”
She certainly has her go-to’s, 
though — toast, salmon, anything 
with eggs and anything with 
avocado.
Ross admits her Instagram 
account, 
which 
is 
currently 
aesthetically pleasing and drool-
worthy, wasn’t always so beautiful 
and well-thought out. She started 
the account after struggling with 
disordered eating the summer 
before high school. It was, in perfect 
13-year-old fashion, donned with 
the title “The Dancing Foodie” and 
was a private account that she hid 
from her family and friends. Once 
those around her found out about 

her secret hobby when she was 
observed photographing her meals 
and gaining interest in culinary 
art, the account came off private, 
underwent a slight transformation 
and began to pick up major traction.
“I mean Instagram for me is 
about connection — it’s how I found 
joy in food again. I met some of 
my best friends at school through 
the community I’ve found on my 
account,” she said.
It seems that Ross was a bit 
of a revolutionary in the small, 
conservative town in rural Ohio 
she calls home, and the community 
she inspired back home has only 
grown since coming to college.
“Some people say that I invented 
avocado toast in Bowling Green, 
Ohio. I definitely didn’t invent it, 
but I was sort of the first to do it.” 
She claimed when asked how her 
upbringing informed her desire 
to create a community for herself 
through Instagram.
“The closest Whole Foods to 
where I live is the one here, so we’d 
drive the hour to Ann Arbor just for 
Whole Foods,” she said. 
If a pro on the pro / con list 
of attending the University is 
proximity to Whole Foods, Ross 
is certainly in the right place. 
Despite her love for Ann Arbor 
and delight in being somewhere 
that has spaces that cater to her 
passions 
— 
specifically 
Tiny 
Buddha Yoga, Fred’s, Zingerman’s 
and her favorite Indian restaurant, 
Cardamom — Ross has a larger 
desire to travel, something the two 
of us share.
She listens nearly exclusively 
to old French music, loves Nina 
George’s novel “The Little Paris 
Bookshop” and has lately been 
exploring different flavor profiles, 
especially Indian and Moroccan 
food. Her travel to-do list is 
overflowing with zip codes in 
countries she’s never been before 
in addition to spots on every corner 
of the United States — normally in 
the pursuit of the foodie havens 
popping up from coast to coast.
“I want to go to L.A., just for 
the food scene. I also really want 
to go to Seattle and Portland — oh, 
and Australia. I feel like I’d love it 
there. And I just picture myself in 
France, maybe Paris, just reading 
and writing and eating a baguette.”
Her travel dreams and future 
destinations stems from her love 
of unique cultures, interesting and 
new flavors and her intense desire 
for adventure and exploration. One 
of her more recent explorations, 
which has planted her desire to 
travel even more, was a yoga retreat 
and trip to Costa Rica, where 
she spent time being mindful, 
immersing herself in unfamiliar 
culture and food and enjoying 
trying new things — like surfing.
“I’m 
open 
to 
anything. 
Especially 
food-wise, 
I’ll 
try 
anything.” She declared, as I 
scraped my bowl of oatmeal clean 
and listened to her stories of Costa 
Rica — including her first time 
surfing, which she deemed scary 
but liberating. Ross appears to 
feel the freest when she is on the 
pursuit of a new adventure, headed 
to a new place or with the promise 
of a unique experience.
The woman she is through her 
beautiful, inspiring photos on 
Instagram is absolutely faithful 
to who she is in real life. In a 
world so quick to document their 
lives in an extremely obscured or 
dismantled way on social media — 
Ross is redefining the norm. Never 
have I met someone whose social 
media accounts are a glimmering, 
authentic mirror reflection of 
exactly who she is — spunky, 
creative, honest and bright. Her 
plans are big, and her dreams 
are lofty but after meeting her in 
person. I have no doubt that she 

will achieve them all.
“Well, sourdough bread saved 
my summer,” she said. “I told 
myself, ‘Maddie, you have to do 
something with your summer,’ so 
I started to make sourdough bread. 
A loaf of sourdough bread is my 
absolute favorite food. But it has 
to be homemade … and naturally 
leavened. I’m a bread purist.”
“Now I could see myself opening 
up a cafe or a bakery…” she trailed 
off thinking for a moment, her 
spoon, cradling a final spoonful 
of oatmeal, suspended in the air. 
“Well, my real dream is to open 
a half bookstore, half bakery. 
I’ve always seen myself running 
a business or being a business 
owner.”
It’s extremely clear why Ross 
can see herself running a business; 
she is passionate and clear in her 
visions, astute and unique in her 
observations 
and 
enthusiastic 
about life. Where Maddie Ross 
exists, negativity does not. It 
seems her major goals in life are 
to always head toward the light 
and away from the darkness, 
remembering to come back to her 
base: good ingredients, wholesome 
meals, lasting conversation, long 
walks and great books. She has 
set concrete values, passions and 
ensures that she gives her full heart 
and an equal amount of her energy 
to each.
One of these is connecting with 
people, something that, as a foodie 
and a social media presence, comes 
as no surprise. 
“Everyone eats, you know? 
To me, the easiest way to crack 
into even the toughest people is 
through a good meal. I love feeding 
people. I love talking to people. I 
love having real, human moments. 
I try my best to fall as far away from 
superficiality as I can.”
Ross was getting ready to head 
to a yoga class after our breakfast 
conversation, in keeping with 
her desire to be in touch with her 
mind and her body, and sported a 
perfectly on brand “Bakers Gonna 
Bake” sweatshirt.
I asked Ross what her life 
philosophy is, beginning from a 
past of disordered eating and self-
doubt, and having grown into such 
a remarkably strong, sanguine 
woman. 
She 
is 
a 
refreshing 
presence in our city and the world 
of Instagram, bringing us doses 
of realness and mentorship with 
every stride forward. 
“I want to lean into the grey 
areas. Sometimes, I’m so locked 
into black and white thinking like 
it’s all or nothing,” she said. “And it 
doesn’t have to always be perfect. 
It doesn’t always have to be in my 
control. I try to focus on what I can 
control, cherish the simple miracles 
and bask in the little moments, 
letting it all happen as it may.”
I headed away from her inviting, 
amiable corner of town and back 
into the frigid and grey world 
outside, feeling a bit sunnier, a bit 
luckier and refreshed from such 
raw conversation. We planned a 
coffee date to find Ann Arbor’s 
best oat milk latte and exchange 
our favorite books but until then 
I’ll have to drool over her recent 
Insta post and channel my best 
Madeleine Ross positivity on my 
most stressful days: Take a deep 
breath, make a good meal and 
remember to be mindful. We all 
need a reminder to stop and be 
present, to share the good in the 
world with faith that goodness will 
be returned back to you.
My 
best 
advice 
to 
head 
toward the real is to follow @
cest.madeleine and allow her to 
inspire you to kickstart start your 
own journey toward the real and 
away from the superficial — in 
food, in relationships and most 
importantly, in life.

STUDENT PROFILE

From an early age I was taught 
to laugh. As a kid, my primary 
caretaker was an ex-doctor from 
the former Soviet Union with an 
ample bosom and several gold 
teeth that twinkled in the light 
every time she smiled. Her name 
was Raya, and she was my favorite 
person in the entire world. Every 
year of my life till the age of five was 
spent with Raya. We would make 
authentic Russian beet borscht and 
watch “Anastasia” and laugh. Oh 
god, we would laugh. Raya was the 
queen of her own kind of borscht 
belt comedy. She compared finding 
love at her age to finding a parking 
spot, every spot being either 
taken or handicapped. Her jokes 
were dirty, and the punchlines 
were always in Russian. I never 
understood them, but I understood 
the hearty belly laugh that followed 
each kicker. It would start deep, 
like a sneeze and travel up through 
her entire body exiting with a bit of 
spittle and excessive force. Her eyes 
would close and the cavernous lines 
like parentheses around her mouth 
would grow longer to highlight her 
wide, golden-toothed grin. Two 
years after her death, I still hear her 
laugh.
Funny women have always had 
a presence in my life. Raya taught 
me to laugh at myself, to laugh in 
the face of pain, to laugh it all away. 
She was my adopted grandmother, 
and she never let me go hungry. 
Come to think of it, I think my 
chubby childhood has something 
to do with Raya’s forceful hand in 
the kitchen. So, dear reader, when 
I hear that ridiculous and oft used 
insult, women aren’t funny, I 
imagine Raya laughing a laugh so 
big that those awful men and their 
micropenises combust from the 
sheer feminine power.
In 2007, Vanity Fair published 
an essay by Christopher Hitchens 
titled “Why Women Aren’t Funny.” 
Yes, really. In the essay, Hitchens 
argued for the “superior funniness 
of men” versus the “inferior 
funniness of women.” According 
to Hitchens, women are inherently 
serious due to their childbearing 
and childrearing capabilities. He 
goes on to write, “For some reason 
women do not find their own 
physical decay and absurdity to be 

so riotously amusing, which is why 
we admire Lucille Ball and Helen 
Fielding, who do see the funny 
side of it. But this is so rare as to be 
like Dr. Johnson’s comparison of a 
woman preaching to a dog walking 
on its hind legs: the surprise is 
that it is done at all.” So, according 
to Hitchens, women do not find 
death as funny as men and they 
are too serious, therefore they are 
incapable of being as funny as men 
or funny at all.

In response to this essay, Vanity 
Fair published an eloquent rebuttal 
by Alessandra Stanley titled, “Who 
Says 
Women 
Aren’t 
Funny?” 
Stanley neatly and savagely lines 
up the ways women have slayed 
the comedy game for centuries. 
She even drops a line about our 
matriarch Sarah cracking a joke 
way back in Genesis. Yeah, we’ve 
been funny for a while. Stanley 
also mentions Kate Sanborn who 
wrote in her 1885 book “The Wit of 
Women”: “No man likes to have his 
story capped by a better and fresher 
from a lady’s lips.” Not much has 
changed since 1885; men still hate 
getting out-witted by funny females. 
Even the “King of Comedy” A.K.A. 
Jerry Lewis claimed again and 
again that women aren’t funny. 
Jerry Lewis repeatedly said he 
didn’t feel “comfortable” with 
women performing comedy and 
when asked if he had a favorite 
female comedian he responded 
that he didn’t have any. When the 
“King of Comedy” says women 
aren’t funny, it becomes more clear 
that maybe the problem isn’t a few 
sour men but a deep-rooted double-
standard riddled with misogyny 
that has infected the entire comedy 
industry. In her essay, Stanley 
writes, “It used to be that women 

were not funny. Then they couldn’t 
be funny if they were pretty. Now a 
female comedian has to be pretty — 
even sexy — to get a laugh.” It turns 
out, no matter what, women are 
criticized for being too much or not 
enough.
If you ask a female comedian how 
they feel about men like Hitchens 
or Lewis or any other white male 
comedian thinking we aren’t funny 
we will answer with a resounding, 
“we don’t f****ing care if you like it” 
(Tina Fey said that). While we don’t 
care what old, dead, white men 
have to say about the inconsistency 
of having boobs and a sense of 
humor, it still sucks. It sucks that 
as women we still have to justify 
our funniness and that we have to 
remind the world that women are 
funny: Remember when Tina Fey 
and Amy Poehler did Weekend 
Update? “Broad City” is still on, 
right? What about that time Cardi 
B co-hosted “The Tonight Show”? 
That was something. Joan Rivers 
once said, “Men find funny women 
threatening. They ask me, ‘Are you 
going to be funny in bed?’” If funny 
women are threatening, angry and 
funny women are a bloody threat. 
But look how far we’ve come! 
Women are killing the comedy 
game, occupying more roles in 
leadership positions on comedy 
networks and making space for 
women in TV, film and the internet 
for their content. So yeah, it sucks 
that women have more to prove, but 
it’s also amazing how much female-
driven content is out there today.
Women are funny because 
funny isn’t gendered. Women are 
funny because jokes should rely on 
one’s wit and talent not on what is 
between one’s legs. And guess what, 
like most subjective things, taste 
differs. And like most performers, 
not everyone excels at their craft. 
So yes, some women may not be 
funny but just as many, probably 
more, men are failing at funny too. 
Men claimed women are unfunny 
because they wanted them in the 
audiences and their beds rather 
than on the stage. The argument 
that women can’t be funny is an 
antiquated, misogynist claim that 
has no evidence or proof, and thus I 
proclaim it dead. Bye forever, good 
riddance.

Women are funny, okay?

Pearson addressing faceoff struggles

Some people get a thrill out of 
the chase — whatever that chase 
entails.
That 
is, 
unless 
you’re 
Michigan hockey coach Mel 
Pearson and what you’re chasing 
is the puck.
Despite 
having 
won 
52 
percent of its draws this season, 
the No. 16 Michigan hockey 
team (5-4-0 overall, 1-1 Big Ten) 
has lost the faceoff battle in each 
of its previous three games. 
And it’s no coincidence that 
the Wolverines’ two top faceoff 
winners, sophomore forward 
Josh Norris and junior forward 
Nick Pastujov, both struggled 
this past weekend against Notre 
Dame.
Norris — who was nursing a 
minor hand injury last weekend 
— won just 13 of 39 faceoffs over 

the weekend, while Pastujov 
took seven of 22 puck drops in 
the circle. The two forwards 
have taken 54 percent of the 
draws thus far for Michigan, so 
in many senses, the team goes as 
they go.
“When you’re not playing 
with the puck, you’re chasing,” 
Pearson said after Tuesday’s 
practice. “You have to try and 
get it back instead of having 
possession, so you’re chasing 
the puck a little bit. And part 
of that is intensity too. Just the 
preparation and being ready to 
play.”
Pearson made it clear that the 
blame cannot always be placed 
solely on whoever is taking the 
faceoff. The team that retains 
possession after the draw is 
recorded with the faceoff win. 
So, in instances where there is 
a 50-50 puck, the team to gain 
control records the win. This is 

where the overall intensity that 
Pearson addressed comes into 
play — another issue that the 
Wolverines have struggled with 
early on this season.
Perhaps overshadowed by the 
team’s recent faceoff woes is the 
performance of junior forward 
Adam Winborg. While Michigan 
has won 85 of 190 draws in its 
last three games, Winborg has 
quietly won 18 of 26 draws over 
that same stretch — the only 
games in which he has seen 
significant ice time this season.
“It’s one of those things that 
will help keep him in the lineup 
when you’re winning faceoffs 
like that,” Pearson said. “It gives 
me a lot of confidence to play him 
against anybody — especially 
in draws in our zone because 
I know he has more than a 50 
percent chance to win those 
faceoffs.”
Winborg played in all but one 

regular season game last year, so 
his lack of ice time thus far may 
come as a bit of a surprise. But 
given his success in the faceoff 
circle, particularly in light of the 
Wolverines’ recent struggles, 
Winborg is a silver lining and 
figures to continue receiving ice 
time moving forward.
Though Michigan has won 
two of its last three games, 
faceoffs are an area of play that 
need to see improvement. As a 
result, Pearson stated that one 
of their big focuses in practice 
recently has been the faceoff: 
taking more of them, addressing 
strategy on draws and ensuring 
that skaters “are dialed in and 
ready for the drop of the puck.”
This is especially important 
with its upcoming matchup 
against No. 5 Penn State this 
weekend — which leads the Big 
Ten with a 62 percent faceoff-
win percentage this season.

Freshmen class ready 
to make impact for ‘M’

Coming into this season, 
the 
biggest 
questions 
for 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team were how 
to replace the program’s all-
time leading scorer, guard 
Katelynn Flaherty, and how 
to maintain the team’s recent 
success. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
answer 
is 
twofold: 
the 
improvement 
of 
returning 
players and the evolution of 
freshmen. 
Prior 
to 
this 
season, 
Michigan 
welcomed 
its 
highest-ranked 
recruiting 
class since the program’s 
creation. 
Highlighted 
by 
guard Amy Dilk and forward 
Naz 
Hillmon, 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico’s 
freshman 
class consists of four former 
ESPNW 
100 
recruits, 
including 
forward 
Emily 
Kiser 
and 
guard 
Ariel 
Young, 
with 
guard 
Danielle Rauch 
rounding 
out 
the group.
“They’re 
definitely 
a 
special group of freshmen,” 
said 
senior 
center 
Hallie 
Thome. “They’re going to 
make an everlasting impact 
on this program for sure.” 
For a team that has as 
many freshmen as it does 
upperclassmen, the younger 
players will play a pivotal 
role 
for 
the 
team 
going 
forward, with their collective 
successes 
telling 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ overall success.
In order to get there, 
though, the freshmen will 
need the guidance of the 
older players to help them 
improve 
their 
skills 
and 
better adjust to college ball.
“I think that if you’re on 
a team that’s just something 
that 
you 
expect,” 
said 
sophomore 
forward Hailey 
Brown on the 
older 
players’ 
mentorship 
role. 
“… 
This team is 
very 
unique 
because we can 
all learn from 
each other. It’s 
not necessarily 
that 
I’m 
someone’s mentor, it’s like, 
‘What can I teach you, but 
what can you teach me as 
well?’ I think it’s a very cool 
role to have but it also works 
the other way, too.”
Due in large part to the 
skill level of every player 
on 
the 
Michigan 
roster, 
the freshmen have already 
noticed a vast improvement 
in their game. 
For Hillmon specifically, 
the competition she faces in 
practice on a daily basis is 
far more competitive than 
what she faced in high school 
games, let alone in high 
school practices. 

“In my high school, I 
was the only big, so I didn’t 
really have anyone pushing 
me 
every 
day,” 
Hillmon 
said. “But … (now) I have a 
lot of people to push me in 
practice and make me want 
to be better. The competition 
day-in and day-out is very 
different from high school.”
In addition to the change 
in 
basketball 
competition 
for the freshmen, they have 
also experienced the same 
transition to college life that 
every 
university 
student 
experiences at some point in 
their life.
Going about that transition 
can be hard for anybody, so it 
has been especially helpful 
for Hillmon and the other 
freshmen to not only have 
each other, but also have the 
older players guide them.
“It’s 
been 
awesome 
having 
someone 
to 
go along this 
journey with,” 
Hillmon 
said. 
“I 
would 
probably 
be 
terrified if I 
was the only 
freshmen, 
so (it’s nice) 
being able to talk to them and 
really vent when something 
isn’t going our way because 
it’s so different from high 
school. 
Having 
somebody 
there to encourage us — they 
know exactly what’s going 
on through my mind — so 
them being there to help me 
through it, just to talk to 
somebody or go and get food.
“But 
the 
upperclassmen 
are very helpful in that way, 
too, because they’ve been 
through it and they try to 
grab our hands and take us 
there with them, so that’s 
been very helpful as well.”
Barnes Arico has loved 
watching the bonds form 
between 
her 
older 
and 
younger players, and looks 
forward 
to 
watching 
the 
freshmen 
continue 
to 
grow 
as 
the 
season unfolds.
“I 
think 
we all are so 
excited 
about 
(the freshmen) 
class,” Barnes 
Arico 
said 
after an 88-40 
win over Mount St. Mary’s 
on Friday night. “They’re a 
special group, led by Amy 
Dilk, starting at the point 
guard position for us. … But 
the rest of the freshmen 
really stepped up and were 
outstanding tonight as well. 
They’re a great group and 
they’re just gonna continue 
to improve as the season goes 
on.”
While this freshmen group 
may still be adjusting to the 
college life, once they are 
fully settled in and find their 
footing, they’ve got a chance 
at making a big impact in the 
Big Ten.

In Villanova trip, Eli Brooks returns to his past

The first thing to understand 
about Spring Grove, Penn. is that 
it’s a small town’s small town.
According to the 2010 Census, 
it houses a population of 2,167. 
It’s known for a paper mill, 
and the smell wafting from it. 
Spring Grove Area High School 
graduates roughly 200-250 kids 
a year and exceedingly few go 
on to play any type of sport at a 
higher level.
This is also the place that 
produced Eli Brooks.
The sophomore guard stood 
in the Crisler Center media 
room last Friday, in the lead-
up to the No. 18 Michigan 
men’s basketball team’s contest 
against Villanova, fielding the 
type of questions you’d expect 
for a homecoming. Jon Teske 
and Jordan Poole are giving up 
their allotted tickets for Brooks, 
but that’s still not enough. 
Brooks thinks eight people are 
getting tickets on their own in 
addition to the 12 or so he can 
get for friends and family.

There’s also the matter of 
his recruitment — one that, at 
a time, seemed a lock for the 
Wildcats. Brooks was on-record 
calling Villanova his dream 
school and when Jay Wright 
extended an offer, it felt like a 
commitment was a formality.
Wright himself said as much 
at the Final Four, the last time 
these two teams met.
“They do have a freshman 
on the team right now that I 
thought we were going to get 
from 
Pennsylvania,” 
Wright 
said then. “And probably not 
allowed to say who I really felt 
we were getting and John beat 
us for him. And he’s going to be 
a really good player for them.”
Reflecting on it last week, 
Brooks 
called 
it 
a 
“tough 
decision,” saying a visit to 
Michigan swayed him at the 
time. Two years removed from 
his commitment, it’s not too 
dissimilar from the language he 
used then.
Brooks’ 2017-18 season was 
somewhat antithetical to the 
Wolverines’. He broke into the 
rotation early, and was the first 

freshman to earn a starting spot, 
unseating Zavier Simpson two 
weeks into the season. He kept 
that job until January. Then he 
didn’t.
The rest of the way, Brooks 
averaged 4.3 minutes per game. 
Simpson 
lapped 
him, 
then 
Jaaron Simmons passed him in 
the depth chart. Brooks was, in 
all but name, out of the picture.
“I think that it happens to the 
seniors, who come to college as 
freshmen,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “They basically 
don’t have days where — they’ll 
have a day or two and then they 
get back to it. They don’t have 
Zavier Simpson guarding them 
every day in practice. Or sit on 
the bench, and then go in two 
minutes and do something good. 
So, you lose all your confidence.”
This year, Brooks’ role is 
already more defined. He has 
played over 20 minutes in both 
of Michigan’s first two games, 
knocking down two 3-pointers 
in the opener to go with four 
assists. As the Wolverines look 
for ways to score, it’s Brooks 
who could reap rewards.

But back to Spring Grove.
The first inkling that Eli 
Brooks might have a future in 
basketball came when he was 
11. His dad’s men’s league was 
down a player, so they asked 
Eli to step in. He dropped six 
points, holding his own against 
a bunch of bigger, better dudes.
“They tried to block my last 
shot,” Brooks said, “then it went 
in. So it was pretty fun.”
By the time Brooks was a 
junior in high school, he was the 
best player the town had seen, 
maybe ever.
“I’ve never seen anyone who 
can create an atmosphere like 
Eli did,” said Greg Wagner, 
Spring Grove’s athletic director. 
“We would travel ... and people 
would come to see Eli. Not just 
the game, but to meet Eli. And 
after games, there would be 
mobs on the court of people 
who wanted to meet Eli, get a 
picture taken with Eli, have Eli 
sign their shirts and things like 
that.”
The stories start to flow like 
beer from a tap. There was the 
time a guidance counselor from 
another school emailed Wagner, 
prompting an internal freakout, 
only to have it be a picture 
of Brooks in the stands with 
a youth basketball program. 
There were all the road games 
that Spring Grove’s fans drove to 
so they could get a glimpse.
There was the first league 
championship since 1971, and 
then there were the crowds. In 
a town of 2,167, there would be 
crowds between 1,800-2,000 
packed into Spring Grove’s gym, 
standing room only, the air thick 
with humidity.
There’s one other athlete to 
come out of Spring Grove in 
recent years: Hali Flickinger, 
a 2016 Olympian who placed 
seventh 
in 
the 
200-meter 
butterfly. When she competed 
in Rio, the town held viewing 
parties in the park. The thing 
about small towns — they’re 
proud of their exports.
When 
Brooks 
eschewed 
Villanova, 
he 
became 
just 
that, an export. It’s games 
like 
Wednesday’s 
that 
will 
determine just how successful 
of one he’ll be.

a lot of people 
to push me in 
practice ...”


Patterson ‘back in that killer mode’

Shea 
Patterson 
remembers 
when he first met Jim Harbaugh. It 
was last December in Mississippi 
when the now-junior quarterback 
found 
the 
Michigan 
football 
coach’s straight-forward approach 
and character endearing. 
So 
much 
so 
that, 
during 
the pair’s first recruiting visit, 
Patterson turned to his friend with 
a prophetic message.
“I want to play for that guy.”
Almost a year later, Patterson 
is indeed playing for Harbaugh 
— and quite well. Patterson has 
thrown for nearly 2,000 yards 
and 17 touchdowns in 10 games as 
a Wolverine, delivering striking 
consistency 
with 
just 
three 
interceptions and a 66 percent 
completion percentage. 
Patterson said that Harbaugh 
naturally 
helped 
with 
his 
knowledge and understanding 
of the game. That has been 
reflected in Patterson’s success 
in transitioning from Ole Miss’ 
spread offense to more complex 
sets at Michigan.
But 
Harbaugh’s 
effect 
on 
Patterson extends far beyond a 
playbook.
“I think he reminded me of 
that feeling again,” Patterson said. 
“Because every coach is different. 
But just his drive, his work ethic 
and the way he runs things here 
reminded me and has gotten me 
back in that killer mode.”
That killer mode is a product 
of an obsession for the game of 
football. It’s well-known that 
Harbaugh has it — from the 
cleats he wears on the sideline to 
mottos like “crave contact” — and 
Patterson says he does as well.
“Just his passion for the game 
— you can really see it,” Patterson 
said. “I think I’m one of those 
guys, too. I love the game. I love 
everything that comes with it. So 
does he, not only as a player back 
when he was playing, but as a 
coach. You can see it.”

That’s just a start for the 
similarities between the two. 
During his weekly radio show 
Monday, Harbaugh said that he 
and Patterson are “on the same 
page,” and even took it a step 
further. 
“I think I get him,” Harbaugh 
said.
The parallels are not glaring 
in front of the media. Harbaugh 
can be unpredictable, tense and 
combative at times. Patterson, 
meanwhile, is soft-spoken and 
even-keeled.
But the two have meshed on 
the football field. Patterson has 
seen clips of Harbaugh during his 
playing days evading defenders 
to complete throws on the run — 
something Patterson continues to 
do successfully at Michigan.
In 
the 
third 
quarter 
last 
Saturday 
against 
Rutgers, 
Patterson rolled to his left and 
threw across his body 30 yards 
down the sideline. It was not a 
high-percentage play — but it 
was for Patterson. He put it in 
perfect position for sophomore 
receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones 
to make the catch for a third-down 
conversion.
“He made some throws that 
were just unbelievable,” Harbaugh 

said Saturday. “Put in the right 
spot, with the wind blowing, 
swirling.”
It was not always this seemingly 
easy for Patterson. When he joined 
Michigan’s roster last winter, his 
eligibility for the 2018 season was 
still up in the air. And though many 
expected he would eventually win 
the starting quarterback job, it 
was not necessarily a guarantee 
for him.
“‘You got to earn it, you got to 
earn everything.’ That’s the first 
thing (Harbaugh) ever told me,” 
Patterson said. “He said when I 
came in, ‘Nothing’s going to be 
given to you. Everything’s going to 
earned. We got some really good 
quarterbacks here, you’re going to 
have to find a way to be the guy.’
“Once I had the opportunity 
to do that through play and the 
season as it goes, we continued to 
build that bond.”
That bond has Patterson and 
the Wolverines in an exceptional 
position now at 9-1 and ranked 
inside the top four. Eleven months 
after he first met Harbaugh, 
Patterson knows his message to 
his friend was the right call.
“It’s been everything and more 
of what I thought it was going to 
be,” Patterson said

 Marshall ready for his last day at ‘M’

This time last year, Lawrence 
Marshall didn’t know whether or 
not he’d be back for a fifth year. 
At that point — a redshirt 
junior — Marshall had played in 
10 career games, with just nine 
tackles to show for it. Defensive 
line 
coach 
Greg 
Mattison 
approached Marshall after last 
season and expressed a desire to 
have him return. Still, Marshall 
was understandably reticent. He 
could have easily departed as a grad 
transfer and found a more regular 
role elsewhere; it would’ve been 
hard to blame him.
Then Mattison told Marshall 
a story that helped bring clarity 
to the situation. Mattison left 
Michigan for Notre Dame in 1996, a 
year before the Wolverines won the 
national title. 
“‘Lawrence, you don’t want to 
feel that way,’ ” Marshall recalls 
Mattison saying, “ ‘leaving and 
Michigan 
winning 
a 
national 
championship and you left at the 
wrong time.’
“I was like, ‘I don’t want to be 
that person.’ ” 
But the decision wasn’t that 
simple — Marshall knew there 
were real reasons to leave. He made 
a pro/con list that included “not 
really playing, not really producing 
as you want to produce.” He knew 
that was a possibility. 
Then, defensive end Chase 
Winovich decided to return for 
a fifth year, quarterback Shea 
Patterson 
announced 
he 
was 
transferring to Michigan and 
Marshall’s mind was made up.
“I talked to Chase. I knew 
(Bryan) Mone was coming back. 
I talked to Jared (Wangler) a little 
bit. I talked to Brandon Watson, too. 
We all just came up with a plan,” 
Marshall said. “Our plan was to beat 
Michigan State, beat Ohio State, go 
to the Big Ten championship, win 
that, go to the playoffs, go to the 
national championship, and we 
have all that at stake right now.

“When you look at the paper you 
were like, ‘Oh my god, this is a great 
team.’ ”
Now, with those goals either 
accomplished or in reach, standing 
weeks away from glory in his 
fifth season, Marshall already 
feels validation. He’s carved out a 
valuable niche on this team, playing 
in seven games and filling in as 
a starter when defensive tackles 
Aubrey Solomon and Michael 
Dwumfour 
went 
down 
with 
injuries. 
When he walks out of the 
tunnel Saturday against Indiana 
for his final home game, Marshall 
admits he “might cry.” Standing in 
Schembechler Hall, senior Tyree 
Kinnel chimes in with a retort: “Of 
course you’re going to cry.”
And who could blame him?
Marshall and his fellow fifth-
year seniors, in particular, have 
seen plenty in their careers. 
The group will walk on the field 
Saturday with a 42-27 record, and 
with more highs and lows than 
most programs experience in a 
decade.
“My journey, it’s been different,” 
he said. “A lot of ups and downs 
— with playing time, with the 
team, not going to a bowl game my 
freshman year — to now, it’s like a 
180.” 
Marshall and his recruiting class 

came in under coach Brady Hoke, 
in an environment starkly different 
from the one they leave. Saturday 
will be reflective for a group that 
withstood those hardships — and 
is emerging triumphant through 
them.
“When we came in, we were 
5-7. We’ve gone through kind of a 
roller coaster, from people telling 
you you’re the greatest thing and 
people telling you you’re almost 
nothing,” Wangler said. “… You 
definitely know what the bottom 
feels like, and (now) you’re getting a 
taste of the top feels like. You really 
just want to keep that momentum 
going and do something special 
with that.”
This isn’t that fairy tale ending 
yet, of course. That can only come 
two, three weeks down the line 
— and then, perhaps, beyond. 
“The goal wasn’t just to win nine 
games — that was never the goal,” 
Marshall said.
But Marshall made a decision 
last season to stick it out, with the 
hope of being in the very position he 
and his teammates currently stand 
in. Senior Day on Saturday will be a 
time for him to appreciate that.
He stands back and shares a 
wide smile.
“Great decision I stayed, right?” 
he says. “I would’ve missed out on 
this.”

What Scientologists taught me about rocks, and 
other discoveries in their brand new Detroit Church

ILLUSTRATION BY CHRISTINE JEGARL


E

very 
Monday 
we 
would crack the spine 
of our “Handwriting 
Without Tears” workbooks, 
an artifact of early 2000s 
elementary school curriculum, 
a time when public schools 
could 
still 
afford 
such 
luxuries. While these cursive 
primers 
generally 
honored 
their promise of dry eyes, 
the exercise of tracing dotted 
lines instead of keystrokes was 
contentious. 
Our 
teachers 
found 
themselves 
playing 
defense 
against a classroom of 10-year-
old children acutely aware of 
the forthcoming extinction of 
script. The translucent blue 
iMac G3 perched in the corner 
of the classroom mocked the 
obsolescence of learning to loop 
letters together. The naivety 
of third grade did not blind us 
from the Lucida Handwriting 
font accessible on a word 
processor. How could they 
contend with the frustration of 
learning to connect a cursive 
“o” to a “l” when the two letters 
were just three millimeters 
apart on a computer keyboard?
My teachers would resort 
to a honeyed threatening — 
a survival tactic refined by 
elementary school educators 
in 
admirable 
fashion. 
The 
sweetness 
of 
their 
candy 
apple red teacher voice would 
mask the startling proposition 
that 
your 
cursive 
abilities 
would determine your future 
academic efficiency: “You will 
need cursive every day once 
you go to middle school to take 
notes.”
What? 
As 
a 
burgeoning 
member of the type A breed 
of student, this notion was 
distressing. 
My 
teacher’s 
correlation of cursive writing 
with success propelled the 
hamster wheel of academic 

anxiety that has not stopped 
turning even 14 years later.
When 
I 
reached 
middle 
school, I kept waiting for the 
day when my fragmented print 
would be rebuked with a red 
pen comment, “Please write 
cursive next time.” But it never 
happened. In high school, I 
braced myself before my first 
Advanced Placement history 
lecture, 
frantically 
trying 
to remember how to write a 
cursive “b.” But the connected 
script 
would 
soon 
prove 
unnecessary as my layman 
handwriting kept pace with the 
slides.
A skill that was once lauded 
by my teachers as indispensable 
became 
irrelevant 
only 
a 
few years later. Just as I can 
no longer tell you what the 
state flower is or how to 
distinguish 
a 
brontosaurus 
from a Tyrannosaurus rex, 
my knowledge of cursive has 
dissolved into the dark hole of 
elementary school acumen.
The cursive alphabet is now 
buried in my hippocampus 

beneath a clutter of keyboard 
shortcuts. The hazy remnants 
of penmanship lessons yield 
a 
mediocre 
signature 
and 
lecture notes that begin with 
the 
intention 
of 
beautiful 
calligraphy but, by the second 
page, evolve to an improvised 
cursive-print hybrid.
I hold no spite for the 
years of cursive lessons we 
endured. Yet, as pupils whose 
identity is so often lauded as 
the iGeneration, I think it is 
important to point out that the 
technology of our classrooms 
was so often juxtaposed against 
an unease for losing the relics of 
traditional schooling. We were 
not immune to the nostalgia 
for the blackboard hallmarks of 
education.
There is perhaps no fiercer 
representation of this reality 
than cursive. It is the reason my 
teachers held their penmanship 
lesson plans so tightly despite 
the headwinds of replaceability 
blowing from Silicon Valley. 
 
No matter how many times 
“Fast 
Company” 
publishes 

another article popularizing 
the technological dependence 
of our generation, it should not 
be forgotten that our 8-year-old 
eyes witnessed the two worlds 
collide. We faced pressure to 
write cursive just as much as 
the burden to type 40 words 
per minute.
Of course, I can understand 
how the belief was formed 
that our generation does not 
understand how the world 
operated 
before 
technology. 
 
The wandering thoughts of 
diarists and sweeping language 
of freedom from an era gone 
by 
are 
now 
encrypted 
by 
slanted 
strokes 
foreign 
to 
today’s readers. Their once-
perfected 
penmanship 
now 
makes our eyes squint as we 
shield embarrassment of the 
unreadability 
of 
a 
bygone 
era’s thoughts. And there will 
certainly be no inked wedding 
invitations 
with 
romantic 
calligraphy or tender script 
journal entries in my future.
Even 
more 
extreme, 
our 
relationship with the pencil 

has become intermittent. After 
a summer of tapping screens 
and dancing on keyboards, we 
reunite with the pencil at the 
first lecture of fall semester. The 
alien sensation of scribbling for 
90-minute intervals welcomes 
us back to the classroom with 
hand cramps and fresh calluses 
reinforcing the endurance lost 
during the summer months. It is 
a reminder of the dispensability 
of writing on a page.
So, I get it. I get how we are 
often viewed as robots who 
lack the grit of paper and pen 
academia.
The inferiority of students 
in our generation is expressed 
through our chicken scratch 
handwriting. But we were in 
the room when our teachers 
espoused 
their 
polemics 
defending cursive. We heard 
the 
whispers 
of 
parents 
worried we were watching 
too much television. And we 
remember 
when 
the 
first 
laptop carts were wheeled into 
the classroom and we dropped 
our pencils.

after 
moving 
to 
Michigan, 
I 
took 
a 
mathematics 
test. 
Our 
teacher 
walked 
slowly 
up and down each aisle, 
handing every student their 
test with a straight face. 
This was a pre-algebra test 
that would determine if we 
were 
competent 
enough 
to stay in the “advanced” 
math track, and everyone 
was expected to pass, as 
it covered concepts from 
the previous year, seventh 
grade. 
The only problem was 
that in the seventh grade, 
my school in Mexico taught 
me 
geometry, 
not 
pre-
algebra. Algebra was our 
subject in the sixth grade, 
but we didn’t use calculators 
or graphing paper. Slope 
was foreign to me, and the 
easy test every “advanced” 
student was supposed to 
fly through wasn’t a breeze 

for me. The next day, the 
teacher again walked up 
and down each aisle, but 
this time she was smiling at 
students. 
Congratulations! You get 
to stay in this class. You get 
to have high school credit 
before going to high school. 
You get to call yourself 
smart. You are “advanced.” 
My test was facing down 
when she walked by my 
desk. Her eyes darted away 
from mine and my smile was 
met only with pursed lips. I 
turned it around and saw I 
had gotten a failing grade, 
only a fifth of the questions 
were marked as correct. She 
never directly spoke to me 
or offered to help me catch 
up. She simply requested a 
meeting with my parents to 
talk about the logistics of 
moving me to the math class 
“adequate” for my level.
“The 
advanced 
mathematics class is too 
fast-paced. 
Andrea 
will 

never be able to catch up. 
I believe it will be best for 
her to have an easier class. 
She will adjust better. She 
doesn’t need to be in the 
“advanced” level. Not every 

student can learn at the level 
of my algebra students.”
At which point, my father 
simply excused himself and 
went home, sat me at the 
dining room table, opened 
my algebra book and told me 
that I was going to stay in the 
class. Every day after that, 
we sat at the table for two 

hours. He taught me how to 
foil, how to find the slope, 
corrected my homework 
and went over my tests with 
me. He sat with me after 
work every day because 
he knew I could do it. My 
father so believed in me 
that he became something 
he wasn’t supposed to be: 
my algebra teacher.
My father became a lot of 
other things for me. He was 
a mentor for my reading, a 
book scout for our monthly 
book club, a dance lover 
during 
my 
recitals. 
He 
even encouraged me to play 
soccer despite my objective 
lack of athleticism. He was 
always 
there 
at 
games, 
watching me fall, step on 
the ball or score on the 
wrong goal, but he never 
once told me he thought I 
shouldn’t do it. He never 
once told me I shouldn’t do 
anything.
I always quietly believed 
my father to be a feminist, 
but I never worked up the 
nerve to ask him because, 
where 
we 
come 
from, 
most men are everything 
but feminist. My father 
grew up in a society where 
men are dry of tears and 
emotion and women have 
nothing but. Men are strong 
and practical and women 
care for nothing other than 
cooking, vanity and gossip.
At 
family 
reunions, 

men are never seen in the 
kitchen. After dinner, they 
never pick up their plates. 
During the party, a man is 
seldom seen taking care of 
a crying child or changing 
a diaper, and at the end of 
the night when it is time to 
clean up, the men wait in 
the living room while their 

wives and daughters clean 
the kitchen. My dad was 
always different, and often 
got made fun of because of 
it. When he went back to 
the kitchen to heat up his 
own tortilla, my mother’s 
competency was questioned. 
When he made sure us kids 
were fed (and didn’t get 
away with only eating cake), 
jokes were made about who 
“carried the ropes” in the 
relationship.
These 
gendered 
lines 
and toxic stereotypes color 
and shape family life in 
Mexico. Breaking them is 
not easy, and the acceptance 
of new and more egalitarian 
family dynamics is harder 
yet. Which is why I was 
surprised that when I called 
my father and asked him 
if he was a feminist, he 
responded with a decided 
yes. He had never acted to 
make me believe he wasn’t, 
but I never thought he 
would admit to it.
“Para mi, el feminismo 
significa que los hombres 
y mujeres deben tener las 
mismas 
oportunidades, 
derechos y obligaciones. Las 
mujeres deben de sentirse 
orgullosas de ser mujeres y 
de ser diferentes.”
“To me, feminism means 
that 
men 
and 
women 
should 
have 
the 
same 
opportunities, rights and 
obligations. Women should 
feel proud to be women and 
to be different”
Maybe 
speaking 
those 
words out loud in front of 
the rest of our family in 
Mexico would have brought 
about even more jokes and 
sneer name calling, but here, 
to me, it meant everything. 
Throughout my life, my 
father has become many 
things for me. He has been 
my math teacher, my soccer 
fan, my reading mentor 
and a shoulder to cry on. 
He has believed in me and 
encouraged me to pursue 
my dreams and passions 
despite any hardship. Never 
once has he made me believe 
that I am not enough. I am 
a feminist because of my 
father, and he is a feminist 
because of me.

On feminism, a question for my father

hen we walked 
into the recently 
opened Church of 
Scientology in Detroit, located 
downtown at 1 Griswold Blvd., 
a man in an ill-fitting black suit 
jumped up from behind the 
front desk and immediately 
told us to fill out a “survey,” 
asking for our full names, 
addresses, 
phone 
numbers, 
emails and reason for the 
visit: “Do you want to be more 
successful?” 
“Do 
you 
have 
deep 
insecurities 
from 
your 
past that 
are holding 
you back?”
“When 
you’re 
finished, 
you can go 
to the room 
on the left, 
and Tony will meet you,” he 
said.
A few days earlier I made 
a 
reservation 
for 
a 
tour, 
carelessly 
using 
my 
real 
name and email address. I 
realized that was a mistake 
when I received a message at 
7:00 p.m. on Friday from the 
church “host” Tony, asking if I 
was a student and if my friends 
were also students, and “If so, 
would you please let us know? 
See you soon, Tony.”
This time I used false 
information 
and 
only 
my 
first name. My two friends 
who came with me, Dom and 
Annie, used false information 
as well.
Founded by L. Ron Hubbard 
in 
1952, 
the 
Church 
of 
Scientology 
was 
originally 
intended as a mental health 
science based on his writings 
on 
“Dianetics,” 
the 
study 
of the human as a spiritual 
being, before it was rebranded 
as a religion in 1953 for tax 
purposes.
Since 
its 
inception, 
the 
church and its core members 
have been convicted of a 

litany of crimes, including 
fraud, 
domestic 
espionage, 
illicit association, extortion, 
violations of labor law and 
practicing medicine without 
a license. The church has 
also been accused of money 
laundering, coercing members 
to have abortions, child slavery, 
ledging 
smear 
campaigns, 
brainwashing, 
organized 
harassment 
of 
journalists 
and institutionalized assault 

by executives levied against 
lower officials.
We hand in our surveys, and 
Annie notices an open guest 
book, grabs a pen and begins 
to write in it. “OH!” the man 
yelps, and throws his hand 
beneath hers. “This is only for 
… This is only for those who 
are ready for it,” he says.
We each nod, like nothing 
could be more natural.
W

e walk through 
the 
high-
ceilinged 
lobby 
and bear left. The décor is 
anachronistic, aiming for posh 
1950s New York Plaza Hotel 
but accomplishing something 
closer to a sterile hospital 
foyer accented with imitation 
gold. Lining the left wall is a 
large black-and-white portrait 
of founder L. Ron Hubbard, 
next to a bookshelf with 
dozens of pristine copies of 
“Dianetics” for sale, each copy 
wrapped in a thin plastic. We 
pass under his gaze and enter 
a long, rectangular offshoot of 
the lobby filled with several 
media viewing stations. These 
stations each have a large 

television placed in front of 
an ottoman, with touchscreen 
controls at the base of the 
television so you can choose a 
video and adjust the volume. 
The videos cover topics like 
“The Analytical Mind” and 
“Past Traumas.”
We meet Tony here. He’s 
a heavier set man with a 
scattered dark beard. He’s 
also wearing a black suit and 
a strange tie that’s cream-
colored 
lengthwise 
and brown at 
the knot. He 
shakes 
our 
hands and asks 
our names.
“What 
brings you in 
today?”
“Just 
interest,” 
I 
reply.
He 
brings 
us over to one of the viewing 
stations and tells us to take a 
seat. The videos will explain 
everything we could want to 
know. He selects one.
A disembodied voice begins 
asking us rhetorical questions 
while clouds fill the screen.
“In your own daily life, do 
you 
sometimes 
experience 
self-doubt? 
Negative 
thoughts? Unreasonable fears, 
upsets or irrational behavior? 
The painful experiences of our 
past clearly have an effect on 
our present behavior. But to 
what degree? And why?”
A woman appears on the 
screen 
throwing 
objects 
— 
clothing, 
a 
suitcase, 
memorabilia — out of her 
apartment window, shrieking, 
“It’s over! It’s over!” at a man 
standing below.
“What causes the mind to 
depart from rational thought? 
Behavior? That is the subject 
of Dianetics.”
The 
video 
goes 
on 
to 
describe, in so many words, 
the mind as a record keeper 
— that these past records are 
what keeps us from present 

happiness. It’s not clear to 
me what separates this from 
mainstream psychology, so 
I ask Tony. He replies that 
psychology studies not the 
whole person, but the brain 
and the functions of the 
body. I ask for a little more 
clarification. 
“It 
doesn’t 
address them as a spiritual 
being,” he presses.
He further explains the 
concept 
of 
the 
repressed 
mind with an analogy: “It’s 
like having a rock in your 
shoe. If you have a rock in the 
bottom of your shoe, you don’t 
know that it’s there. You walk 
around, your foot hurts, you’re 
changing the way that your 
gait goes, throws your back 
out, your hip starts to hurt, 
having problems in different 
places. It all stems from 
having a rock in your shoe, 
but until you find that piece 
that you don’t know about, you 
can’t solve it.”
He walks with us over to 
a shelf and picks up a golden 
machine. It has an oval face 
with a little black arrow that 
moves back and forth. The 
design looks like what science 
fiction 
writers 
in 
1980s 
thought 
technology 
would 
look like in the 2000s: flashy, 
overly large, reminiscent of an 
old radio box refurbished and 
painted gold.
“That’s 
why 
we 
have 
auditing 
sessions. 
Auditors 
use these E-Meters to help 
find that rock.”
Tony says that there are 
dozens 
of 
people 
in 
the 
building trained to use these 
machines 
during 
sessions, 
wherein an auditor asks the 
subject 
pointed 
questions 
about 
themselves 
while 
the subject holds onto two 
metal 
clamps 
attached 
to 
the 
E-Meter. 
The 
auditor 
registers movement via the 
small, sensitive dial of the 
E-meter, and that movement 
apparently registers negative 
brain activity.
Annie steps up to test it 

out. She holds the two metal 
clamps, and Tony pinches her 
on her arm — “This is a tiny 
trauma, but it will register 
on the E-Meter” — and we all 
lean in to watch the needle. It 
wavers back and forth, and I 
can’t tell what the verdict is.
Tony follows it closely. “See, 
look how it moves,” he says. 
We all nod, assuming he can 
see something on that meter 
that we could not.
Tony was in the Navy before 
he became a Scientologist. 
Prior to enlisting, he studied 
psychology at a university but 
dropped out. He told us that 
L. Ron Hubbard’s “Dianetics” 
made far more sense to him 
than anything he read in his 
textbooks.

We walk around the left 
wing for a little while longer, 
asking him more questions 
about 
himself 
and 
the 
building.
T

he 
Church 
of 
Scientology 
of 
Michigan moved to 
this downtown location just a 
few weeks ago. The building 
dates back to 1927 and was 
designed 
by 
prominent 
American-Italian 
architect 
Corrado Parducci, who also 
designed the Masonic Temple 
and The Guardian Building 
just across the street. The 
church purchased the entire 
building 
and 
occupies 
all 

eight floors. Two are course 
rooms, where Scientologists 
study their literature. One is 
dedicated to auditing; one is 
a bookstore; one is a service 
center; one is administrations; 
one is for the executives; one is 
a chapel (on the day I visited, 
a christening was taking place 
there).
Before the building was 
purchased by the church, it 
was occupied by a bank. Long 
before that, it was the site of 
the first building on record 
ever constructed in Michigan, 
the 
Ste. 
Anne’s 
Catholic 
Church. 
The Church of Scientology 

spent 
the 
last 
10 
years 
renovating the interior, and 
it officially opened on Oct. 14 
of this year. David Miscavige, 
the leader of Scientology 
himself, gave an opening 
address. According to the 
church, the ceremony was 
attended by a crowd of more 
than 2,000.
Tony is visibly proud of the 
building and brings us to the 
old bank vault, which they’ve 
converted into a conference 
room. The ceiling is low. 
Tony’s voice is clear among 
a 
claustrophobic 
silence. 
Looking down over the white 
circular table in the center 
is another black-and-white 
photo of L. Ron Hubbard, 
the same as the one in the 
lobby. There’s a Keurig on 
a low rise shelf beneath a 
large television mounted to 
the wall.
I ask if we 
might see the 
rest of the of 
the floors.
“We 
have 
free 
personality 
exams 
on 
the 
fourth, 
would you be 
interested?”
T

he 

fourth 
floor 
is filled with more men in 
ill-fitting suits. A large one 
strides by wearing a Yankees 
beanie. 
A 
shorter, 
older 
woman dons a black turban. 
A man with a thin, sculpted 
beard wears two gold hoop 
earrings. Later, we learn his 
name is Eddie.
Tony brings us over to the 
Testing 
and 
Registration 
Center, and sits us down at 
four desks, each with exam 
books. The test is called the 
Oxford Capacity Analysis™ 
Exam, and there are 200 
questions, 
each 
answered 
with a +, M (for “Maybe”) or -. 
Here are a few of them:
“60. Do you consider the 

modern ‘prisons without bars’ 
system doomed to failure?”
“98. Would you use corporal 
punishment on a child aged 
ten if it refused to obey you?”
“130. Are you aware of any 
habitual physical mannerisms, 
such as pulling your hair, nose, 
ears, or such like?”
“163. Would you like to ‘start 
a new activity’ in the place in 
which you live?”
By question 70 I’ve noticed 
that I’m profoundly hungover, 
and begin losing the ability 
to 
answer 
the 
questions 
earnestly, so I bubble them in 
at random, making zig-zags 
like I did in middle school 
science classes. Annie begins 
to do the same. A woman 
peers over from behind the 
registration desk, noticing our 
rapid bubbling. She chews her 
gum slowly and glances back 
down at her phone. We wait 

for Dom, who’s taking the 
exam quite seriously. Twenty 
minutes later (there was a 
School Smart™ timer on each 
of our desks) we hand our 
scantrons in together.
As we wait for our results, 
several people show up to 
stand next to the registration 
desk, and begin whispering 
to each other with worried 
expressions. Then the woman 
behind the desk asks Annie 
if she’d like to have her 
consultation first, and she 
agrees. She’s taken to one of 
several glassed-in conference 
rooms behind the registration 
desk and waves us goodbye. 
Dom is next, and he goes 

with Eddie, the man with 
the golden hoop earrings and 
the sculpted beard. About 
10 minutes later, the woman 
finishes with Annie and calls 
me back.
I sit in a chair facing the 
window, which looks over the 
Detroit River. I can see the 
shoreline of Windsor, Canada 
with the bright Caesars sign 
above the city. 
The woman sits next to 
me at a white desk. 
She’s 
not 
chewing 
gum 
anymore.
“I’m Maya,” she says. “Have 
you ever taken a personality 
test before?”
Maya has a reserved aura, 
and hunches her shoulders 
over the desk as she talks. Her 
hair is dark and vaguely curly, 
her face noticeably round.
“Yes,” I reply.
“Cool. So this is a tool that 
we 
use 
— 
it’s not my 
opinion 
of 
you. It’s your 
opinion 
of 
yourself.”
I nod, and 
she 
pulls 
out a graph 
with 
my 
fake 
name 
and 
fake 
information 
in the top 
left corner. 
The graph has 10 sections, 
labeled A through J, and 
each section has a trait at 
the top and its counter at the 
bottom. “Stable” is opposite 
“Unstable,” “Happy” opposite 
“Depressed,” 
“Responsible” 
opposite “Irresponsible” and 
so on. The graph goes from 
+100 at the top, along the 
positive traits, to -100 at the 
bottom, along the negative 
traits. My graph is entirely in 
the negative half of the grid.
Maya is being cautious, and 
says with a tone of regret, 
“Right here is the normal 
area,” circling the top half 
of the graph, “And here …

What Scientologists taught me about rocks, and other discoveries in 
their brand new Detroit Church

“Would you use 
corporal punishment 
on a child aged ten if it

carelessly using my real

is where you’re at.” My graph 
put me at -100 for nervousness, 
-88 for depression and -79 for 
instability.
I nod.
“I see.”
“So the results are ... that it 
shows that you’re unstable…”
I nod again, and she lowers her 
voice.
“You’re … depressed.”
Another nod.
“You’re 
a 
really 
nervous 
person.”
“Hm.”
“Sometimes 
you’re 
really 
active, sometimes you’re not 
active at all.”
“Mhm.”
“And 
then 
right 
here 
is 
aggressiveness. So you’re really 
putting yourself out there. Then 
… over here is … you’re kind of 
irresponsible.”
“OK.”
“But, 
you’re 
a 
pretty 
appreciative person.”
She looks up from the graph 
and smiles at me.
“That’s cool.”
Maya lists the rest of my 
character flaws, and suggests 
that I am likely dealing with some 
past trauma from my childhood, 
probably something related to 
abandonment by parental figure. 
When she’s done, she asks me 
how all of this makes me feel.
“Well, it checks out,” I tell her.
Maya offers me some literature 
on upcoming courses, as well as 
an evaluation packet. The front 
reads, “This is your personalized 
route to happiness and success. 
Start today!”
She points to a pamphlet 
on a course titled “Personal 
Efficiency.”
“This personal efficacy (sic) 
course really helped me when 
I started out,” she says. “When 
I came in, I was like -100 on 
everything. Now I’m in the 
normal range.” When I later 
researched the course online, 
I saw it had a required seminar 
“donation” of $50.
Maya attended culinary school 
in California and was hoping to 
become a baker when she found 
the church. Struggling in a bad 
relationship, she took the Oxford 
Capacity Analysis™ Exam at a 
Scientology center in August, 
and subsequently signed up for 
some classes. In September, as 
the relationship worsened, she 
decided to leave California and 
work full time for the church. I 
asked if she still baked. She said 

yes, sometimes.
“The church really helped 
me work through things from 
my past,” she said. “I’m more 
confident now, my chart is 
better.”
When I hear the trajectory 
that led Maya to the church, I 
feel guilty, as if my half-hearted 
attempt at joining Scientology 
was a direct slight towards her, 
and one she didn’t deserve. 
But later, when Dom, Annie 
and I compared our graphs, we 
noticed they that each appeared 
disturbingly similar. We are 
all, according to the Church of 
Scientology, very nervous, very 
depressed, very unstable and 
very aggressive.
In my mind, the scam was 
too obvious. What cult would 
recruit you by saying you’re 
fine as you are? Certainly not 
one as successful as the Church 
of Scientology. Though their 
numbers have greatly diminished 
since their peak in the late 20th 
century, estimates hold that 
anywhere between 20,000 and 
40,000 people worldwide are 
committed to Scientology today. 
Their reach is undeniable, and 
not just among well-publicized, 
powerful celebrities like Tom 
Cruise 
and 
John 
Travolta. 
Average people dissatisfied with 
their lives continue to seek solace 
in the church.
Despite the documentaries, 
the exposés and the criminal 
charges, the church continues 
to successfully recruit members 
because there is no shortage of 
vulnerable people who crave the 
acknowledgement of personhood 
this sort of organization claims 
to offer. Ultimately, the escape 
that Scientology promises with 
just a few paid courses and some 
overpriced books is too enticiting 
to deny when reality offers only 
duller truths.
For those who don’t have a 
support system in place when 
they’re distraught and need to be 
heard, I can imagine that it’s not 
strange and amusing for a kind 
woman with dark curly hair to 
hold their hands softly on a desk, 
look them in the eyes and affirm 
quietly, “You’re … depressed.” 
It’s a revelation.
Eddie, the man who spoke 
with Dom about his character 
insufficiencies, takes us to the 
elevator. As we wait for it to 
arrive, Eddie tells us that he went 
to Vermont for a year to play 
soccer on a full ride, but tore his 
ACL, so he had to quit the team 
and lost his scholarship. He went 

home for a year, and then did 
community college for another 
before transferring to New York 
University. He joined the church 
in 2011.
He mentions multiple times 
that his wife is 
upstairs, 
and 
that his kid is 
downstairs in the 
children’s 
room. 
In the lobby, we 
see a boy no older 
than 12 running 
around 
in 
a 
Pokemon T-shirt. 
This is Tony’s son, 
Jason. Tony tells 
Jason to go back 
downstairs.
Eddie 
brings 
us back through 
the lobby offshoot 
with the watching 
stations, talking quickly as we 
walk behind him. He grabs a 
plastic-wrapped book from one 
of the shelves and hands it to 
Dom.
“This one book 
more than anything 
else really helped 
me. This is the one 
that 
you 
should 
definitely get. Don’t 
walk out of here 
without that book. 
It’s only $20, it’s not 
like a big thing. I 
don’t know, a lot of 
people try to push 
it, but I don’t like to 
push it too hard. A 
lot of people need to 
take it at their own 
pace. 
I’m 
reading 
— you know what 
I’m 
reading 
right 
now? — I’m reading 
‘Battlefield 
Earth.’ 
It’s like a fiction 
book, 
by 
L. 
Ron 
Hubbard. 
There’s 
a lot of technology 
in it. It’s about like 
aliens, 
this 
and 
that … Here, and 
this book too has 
all the stuff, it’s got 
impact, self reliance, 
communication, 
everything, 
you 
know 
it 
can 
like, 
bring 
your 
responsibility 
up, 
and I told you, if 
you want to do the 
seminar, 
just, 
I’ll 
give you my cell 
phone number, let 
me know when you 
come back, it’s only 

$30 more. I’m not gonna charge 
you $50, you know, that’s fucked 
up. A lot of people are pushy 
pushy but I’m not like that. We 
do have other small pamphlets, 
if you think you’d be into that, 

for like $5 dollars. It’s up to you 
guys, it’s about what you guys 
want to get out of it. DVDs too. 
Here, take one. Anything? No? 
Have you guys seen the vault?”

When I hear the trajectory 
that led Maya to the church, I 
feel guilty, as if my half-hearted 
attempt at joining Scientology was 
a direct slight towards her, and one 
she didn’t deserve.

I

f you don’t want to 
be stereotyped, don’t 
tell 
people 
you’re 
from the South.
People will usually be 
hesitant to make judgements 
on background information 
they receive, but letting 
people know you grew up in 
the Bible Belt is a surefire 
way to get pegged as a 
country-music loving, farm-
raised, bull-riding redneck 
or hillbilly.
I 
mean, 
they’re 
not 
entirely 
wrong, 
though. 
Have you been to Missouri?
But I’m from Memphis. If 
you think it’s like Nashville, 
you’re wrong. But if you 
think it’s like Detroit, I’d 
give you a pass, because it’s 
not too far off. But Memphis 
is Memphis and there’s no 
other way to put it.
So I grew up in the heart 
of the South in good ol’ 
Memphis, Tennessee. It’s 
funny how different the 

perception 
is compared 
to the reality. 
It’s one of those 
cases where people 
think one thing but 
it turns out to be the 
complete opposite. We 
don’t have that much clout 
on country music (though 
Johnny Cash started his 
career there), but we’re 
built on hip hop, blues and 
rock-n-roll. We’re the blue 
district in a sea of red. We’re 
the cultural preservation 
where all other things are 
changing.
But if there’s anything 
about Memphis that’s not 
a far departure from the 
southern stereotype, it’s the 
cuisine.
Memphis has a rep for a 
lot of things: music, a history 
of civil rights activism and 
ducks. But nothing defines 
Memphis better than its 
food.
T

here’s 
twofood 
genres that I’d say 
best exemplify the 
city. And number one would 
probably be hard to miss: 
Memphis barbecue.
It’s unavoidable. You’ve 
heard of it. But the odds 
that you’ve actually had it 
are slim.
In October, I went on 
a trip with the Kayaking 
Club at the University of 
Michigan to Slippery Rock, 
Pennsylvania. After a long 
day in the river, we decided 
to Yelp the best nearby 
restaurant 
and 
take 
a 
chance, since we were kind 
of in the middle of nowhere.

So 
two 
Midwesterners, 
a 
West Coaster and 
a New Yorker walk 
into a barbecue place. A 
Memphian sits down.
It was pretty clear they 
had no idea of the depth 
that barbecue goes – I could 
tell when they were shell-
shocked from me asking if 
the barbecue was dry-rub or 
wet-rub. To them, barbecue 
was just another meal, an 
entree to get by. Here’s 
the proper breakdown of 
the fine detail you should 
always 
pay 
attention 
to 
when judging barbecue: wet 
or dry, sweet or sour and 
type of meat.
Memphis 
barbecue 
is 
pretty well defined. Slow 
cooked pork ribs, almost 
always 
dry 
rub, 
with 
vinegar and pepper-based 

sauce or rub.
These are the fine details 
that 
are 
etched 
into 
a 
Memphis history that go 
unnoticed by outsiders.
Continuing on the road 
trip, trying to kill some 
time, we played a guessing 
game that involved giving 
hints to lead the others to 
the word we were thinking 
of. So when it was my turn 
to give hints, I gave a few 
that I thought would be a 
dead giveaway
“Hound Dog.”
When 
they 
responded 
with silence, I put in a less 
confident, 
“Heartbreak 
Hotel,” before giving in and 
saying, “Graceland.”
At the time, I wasn’t 
sure if it was just because 

they 
were 
uncultured 
swine or not, but I thought 
Elvis Presley should be a 
universally recognized icon. 
Then I realized something. 
We 
had 
primarily 
been 
listening to country music.
The unspoken rule of long 
road trips is that you play 
music to cater to everyone’s 
tastes. So odds are they had 
subconsciously 
grouped 
my taste of music based on 
my Southern roots. But the 
capital of country music is 
Nashville. Trust me, it’s not 
Memphis.
Part of it is growing up 
right next to Graceland. But 
part of it might be like it is 
with barbecue — there’s so 
much that isn’t immediately 
obvious until you’ve lived 
there. And the same with 
B.B. 
King 
and 
Justin 
Timberlake and Three 6 

Mafia and so on. It’s not 
something you just group 
together as one thing unless 
it’s music in Memphis.
I

f you like spice, you’d 
love the second food 
type 
food: 
wings. 
I’m not going to lie, I’m an 
addict for wings. I had a 
near-two-week 
streak 
of 
eating at Mr. Spots in Ann 
Arbor every day. It was way 
worse in Memphis.
It’s a subtler part of 
the city you don’t really 
appreciate until you leave 
Memphis. 
When 
I 
first 
came to Ann Arbor, the 
first thing I looked for were 
local wing shops. It’s not 
really a struggle you’d find 
in Memphis, where every 
corner has a shop that’s at 

least an eight out of 10.
Inside 
the 
good 
food 
bubble of Memphis, you 
don’t really realize how 
different it is elsewhere.
L

ast month I was 
shopping for a used 
bike and found a 
guy on Craigslist who lived 
in Farmington Hills. He 
wanted to meet late in the 
evening, and though I was 
a little spooked at first, he 
was kind enough. He was 
an Indian national who had 
run out of luck on his U.S. 
visa, and unfortunately was 
about to be deported and 
therefore was selling his 
stuff cheap.
We conversed a little 
bit about the bike before 
gradually drifting to discuss 
where 
we 
were 
from. 
When I told him I’m from 
Tennessee, his disapproval 
was obvious. I drew a 
contemptful 
side-eyed 
glance from him, a joking 
(but not really) raise in the 
bike’s price, even the not 
so subtle, “I hate Trump.” 
It was clear he thought of 
Tennessee as a backward 
place responsible for the 
country’s 
reactionary 
immigration policies, and 
that I was a reflection of it.
I never did correct him. 
Probably still thinks he 
sold his bike to a right-wing 
country hick who helped 
him get deported.
But that’s most people. 
Maybe not to that extreme, 
but a lot of South is unfairly 
grouped as one stereotype. 
You tell people you’re from 
the South, expect questions.
“Where’s your accent?” 
or “Is this your first time 
seeing snow?”
Expect skeptical glances 
during 
election 
season. 
Expect to be defaulted as a 
country music lover.
Because I’ve been there 
and done that. But don’t 
worry, I’m not from any 
place in the South. I’m from 
Memphis, born and raised.

Taste of the South

BY TIEN LE, DAILY SPORTS WRITER

Memphis has a rep for a lot of things: 
music, a history of civil rights activism 
and ducks. But nothing defines 
Memphis better than its food.


The UM Boxing Club competes in shows and tournaments 
year round, culminating in the United States Intercollegiate 
Boxing Association (USIBA) Nationals Tournament in March. 
Many competing boxers join the club with zero prior experi-
ence, some of who bring back championship belts at the year’s 
end. Found throughout their practice space in the Sports 
Coliseum are the letters TDSM - teamwork, dedication, slight 
work, and motivation. The mantra can be heard echoed at the 
breakdown of each practice, six nights per week.
