Though the first presidential 

debate drew wide interest on 
campus 
Monday 
night, 
that 

interest may not necessarily 
have equated to any changes in 

voter preference, according to a 
Michigan Daily poll conducted 
directly after the debate.

As part of an ongoing initiative 

to better gauge the campus 
political climate, The Michigan 
Daily sent out a poll to 1,500 
students 
and 
received 
302 

responses. Eighty-one percent of 

respondents said they watched 
the first presidential debate — the 
same percent of respondents also 
reported they will “definitely” 
vote in the upcoming election.

The 
majority 
of 
students 

surveyed indicated that overall, 
Democratic presidential nominee 

On 
his 
path 
to 
the 

Republican 
presidential 

nomination, Donald Trump 
has both built a dedicated base 
in some parts of the population 
and noticeably isolated others.

On 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s campus, a new club 
— Students Against Trump 
— has formed in response to 
Trump’s often controversial 
persona and words.

During the election, Trump 

has created a persona built 
in large part on a tendency 
to stray from his scripted 
speeches, tweet on-the-spot 
and say whatever may be on his 
mind. Many of his supporters 
cite this as a positive, but 
others have also pointed to 
statements he’s made — such 
as proposing to build a wall 
between the U.S. and Mexico 
and 
to 
shutdown 
Muslim 

immigration into the country 
— as alarmingly offensive.

Given that division, the new 

student group’s main goal, the 
group says, is to stop Trump 
from 
reaching 
the 
White 

House.

Bradley McPherson, LSA 

sophomore and president of 
Students Against Trump, said 
he felt the need to create an 
organization in response to 
the candidate last May, after it 
became clear Trump would be 
the likely Republican nominee.

“Looking at Trump’s policies 

and his character, we thought 
we had to make a larger point 
against him,” McPherson said. 
“We thought we should speak 
out against all these factors 
and that culminated in the 
creation of the club.”

Specifically, the club hopes 

to block people’s perception of 
Trump as a viable candidate 
for office. Both Trump and 
Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton have historically high 
unpopularity ratings among 
the national voting population 
— 
a 
recent 
ABC 
News/ 

Washington Post polling found 
that 56 percent of adults view

School of Public Health student Rebecca Ahmad-Robinson and LSA sophomore Maya Green listen to other audience members speak during a debate on the Black Lives Matter movement held by the Michigan 
Political Union in the Michgian League on Tuesday.

A 
debate 
Tuesday 
night 

sponsored by The Michigan Political 
Union came to an abrupt halt after 
hundreds of community members 
and University of Michigan students 
gathered outside the Michigan 
League’s Vandenberg Room to call 
for the inclusion of Black voices.

The 
debate, 
which 
featured 

members of MPU, was slated to 
discuss the merits of the Black Lives 
Matter Movement and whether it 
was “harmful to racial relations in 
the United States.”

Social Work student Lawrielle 

West, one of the protest organizers, 
called 
the 
debate 
unacceptable 

because of its patronizing and 
diminutive focus.

“You 
cannot 
trivialize 
my 

experience as a Black person by 
debating it,” she said. “How can you 

debate my experience? I’m not saying 
I’m better than you or that only Black 
lives matter or that my life matters 
more than yours, but I’m saying that 
Black lives do matter.”

The protest began at the Diag 

and marched toward the Michigan 
League, chanting phrases such 
as “Black lives matter” and “No 
justice, no peace.” As the crowd 
entered during the start of the 
debate, several protesters asked

The University of Michigan’s 

College of Literature, Science and 
the Arts hosted a gathering of 
more than 100 students, professors 
and advisers promoting solidarity 
against racism Tuesday night 
in response to racially charged 
posters found on campus Monday.

Along with an announcement 

of the event, LSA Dean Andrew 
Martin 
released 
a 
statement 

supporting 
those 
students 

impacted by the incident Monday.

“We 
stand 
with 
President 

Schlissel and University leaders in 
condemning the racist posters and 
flyers spread on campus today,” 
the statement said. “These posters 
advocating 
white 
supremacy 

strike at the very heart and soul 
of the College. Their presence 
marred our physical spaces—in 
Haven and Mason halls—where 
we hold our classes and where our 
faculty and staff work, and are an 
assault on everything we believe 
in as a liberal arts college and as a 
diverse community.”

Tuesday 
evening, 
Martin 

said he wanted the event to be 
welcoming in nature, and hoped 
to foster reflection on the events 
from the last few days and, more 
broadly, the climate on campus for 
the last few years.

Tuesday marked National Voter 

Registration Day. In Michigan, the 

last day to register to vote in the 

presidential election is Oct. 11 — a 

mere two weeks away.

With 40 days until the 

election and 13 days until the 

voter registration deadline, voter 

mobilization efforts are in full 

swing around campus. Partisan 

voter registration efforts organized 

by the University of Michigan’s 

chapters of College Democrats and 

College Republicans will continue 

to take place in the Diag and Mason 

Hall.

Nonpartisan initiatives, like 

Central Student Government’s 

Voice Your Vote registration drive, 

will launch efforts on Sunday to 

register students outside of each 

residence hall on campus. The 

initiative will conclude next Friday, 

Oct. 7.

Those not registered to vote in 

the upcoming presidential election 

yet must do so by mail or in person, 

not online. To check the specific 

voter registration guidelines for 

Michigan, visit the Michigan 

Secretary of State’s website.

If students are unsure if they 

are registered to vote in the state of 

Michigan, they can also check their 

registration status online.

Chelsea Clinton spoke with 

students across the country 
in honor of National Voter 
Registration 
Day 
Tuesday, 

in a phone conference about 
the importance of millennial 
participation in the upcoming 
presidential election.

Clinton, 
daughter 
of 

Democratic 
presidential 

nominee 
Hillary 
Clinton, 

stressed 
the 
significance 

of 
college 
communities 
in 

elections, 
saying 
millennial-

aged voters make up roughly 31 
percent of the electorate.

“We are in the middle of a big 

push to register people and get 
them to go out and vote,” Clinton 
said. “And I hope that last night’s 
debate demonstrated the clear 
contrast between my mom and 

her opponent, and demonstrated 
what is at stake this November.” 

After speaking about voter 

registration and the significance 
of voter mobilization, Clinton 
also 
fielded 
questions 
from 

students at universities across 
the country.

Clinton first addressed a 

question about the differences 
between 
Hillary 
Clinton’s 

education policies and President 
Barack Obama’s. 

In her response, she said 

Obama 
does 
not 
receive 

enough credit for his education 
initiatives, also highlighting the 
ways Hillary Clinton aims to 
address education as a part of 
her platform.

“There are several things 

that my mom wants to address 
in 
regards 
to 
education 

policy that would build off of 
President 
Obama,” 
Clinton 

said. “For example, she wants 

to enable anyone and everyone 
to index their loan payments 
as a percentage of their income 
so that nobody has to make a 
professional decision to service 
their debt.”

During Obama’s terms, he 

instituted the “Pay as You 
Earn” plan to expand income-
based repayment — a plan that 
caps students’ monthly loan 
payments based on income and 
family size. The program lowers 
monthly payments and expands 
the length of the repayment 
period.

A student on the call also asked 

Clinton about the best ways to 
motivate students to vote, given 
the large numbers of people who 
feel apathetic toward both major 
party candidates.

In a recent Michigan Daily 

poll of a sample of students on 
campus, 
though 
respondents 

indicated 
overwhelming 

support for Hillary Clinton, 
13 percent also indicated 
support for Libertarian Party 
candidate 
Gary 
Johnson, 

more 
than 
the 
support 

Trump received.

“Voting is a very personal 

thing. ” Clinton said. “What 
I encourage you to do is ask 
people who are not inclined 
to vote is ‘What issues do you 
care about?’”

This sentiment of voter 

apathy 
resurfaced 
when 

Clinton was asked about 
engaging former supporters 
of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) 
who feel disaffected and 
question whether Hillary 
Clinton is equally liberal.

“My mom has offered the 

most progressive platform 
of 
a 
major 
presidential 

candidate ever,” Clinton said. 
“This is apparent when you 
look at her record fighting 
for children, fighting for 
more investment in public 
schools, fighting for criminal 
justice reform from her time 
as a young lawyer until now 
during her campaign.”

University announces start of preferred pronoun initiative

The University of Michigan 

announced 
Tuesday 
that 

effective 
immediately, 

students 
will 
be 
able 
to 

indicate 
their 
preferred 

gender 
pronoun 
on 
class 

rosters.

Provost 
Martha 
Pollack 

and E. Royster Harper, vice 
president for student life, said 
in an email to the campus 
community that a pronoun 
committee 
comprised 
of 

faculty and staff members 
has developed this process 
over the past year. A petition 
authored 
by 
Wolverines 

for 
Preferred 
Pronouns 

last March called for the 

University to put pronoun 
preferences on class rosters, 
gaining 795 signatures.

The 
email 
defined 
a 

preferred 
pronoun 
as 
a 

gender pronoun with which 
an individual would like to 
identify and expects others to 
use when referring to them.

“Students 
can 
designate 

pronouns 
in 
Wolverine 

Access 
through 
the 
new 

Gender Identity tab within 
the 
Campus 
Personal 

Information section,” Pollack 
and Harper wrote in the 
email. “This page will be used 
to enter/update and/or delete 
pronoun information with the 

University.”

This change is considered 

part 
of 
the 
University’s 

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
initiative, which will be fully 
launched on Oct. 6.

Pollack and Harper also 

encouraged 
students 
and 

faculty to examine the rosters 
on Wolverine Access and be 
mindful of addressing people 
correctly.

“Asking about and correctly 

using someone’s designated 
pronoun is one of the most 
basic ways to show your 
respect for their identity and 
to cultivate an environment 
that 
respects 
all 
gender 

identities,” they wrote. “If 
you make a mistake and use 
the wrong pronoun, you can 
acknowledge that you made a 
mistake, and use the correct 
pronoun next time.”

Students were encouraged 

to 
change 
their 
prefered 

pronoun before mid-to-late 
October 
because 
faculty 

members have been asked to 
review class rosters again at 
the end of the month and use 
the updated pronoun at that 
time for the remainder of the 
semester.

“I want each and every student 

here to know that you are welcome 
here, and we’re proud that you are 
here, and your faculty members 
and your staff that work with you 
on a daily basis are proud of you,” 
Martin said.

After Martin’s remarks, the 

gathering was loosely structured, 
and invited students to engage in 
individual discussion with one 
another.

While 
the 
flyers 
were 
a 

large part of the conversations, 
discussions 
also 
addressed 

broader topics of racism on 
campus and in society at large. 
LSA freshman Bailey Dozier-
Shabazz said she appreciated the 
opportunity to share her thoughts 
about the fliers.

“It makes me feel a little bit 

unsafe, like I’m not even wanted 
here,” Dozier-Shabazz said.

Students like LSA freshman 

Carlena Toombs attended the 
event looking for answers as to 
how the University would respond 
to the fliers.

“I came to the event just to 

observe how exactly LSA plans to 
deal with the issues such as the 
racist flyers, because I love the 
University of Michigan, but I’m 
still having trouble finding what 
is the place of the Black students 
here,” Toombs said.

While 
Toombs 
said 
she 

appreciates steps taken by the 
University, she added that the 
response was not entirely in line 
with what the Black campus 
community wants.

“I feel like it’s very hard for 

(the administration) to do what 
we, Black students, want them 
to do, but, at the same time, I 
appreciate them allowing things 
like protests to go on, which I feel 
like is as much as they really can 
do, politically,” Toombs said

Reginald Hammond Jr., student 

administrative assistant at the 
Lloyd Hall Scholars Program, said 

he thinks the event was a strong 
beginning to a greater movement 
on campus.

“This is the beginning of 

discussions, of building a culture 
where people feel comfortable 
expressing how they feel and 
being in a place with other people 
who are unlike them who embrace 
their differences,” Hammond said.

LSA sophomore Chanelle Davis 

said the flyers were an attempt 
to hijack the Black experience of 
oppression.

“It was offensive to me as 

a Black person, because I feel 
like people like that often try 
to take away from what we as 
Black people or we as people of 
marginalized identities try to do: 
get the world to understand why 
we are oppressed,” Chanelle said. 
“And I feel like we try to have the 
conversation a lot and for them 
to portray things like they’re the 
ones being attacked, that they’re 
the ones not being able to be who 
they are freely is not accurate — it’s 
not fair to us.”

COMMUNITY

Hillary Clinton performed better 
in the debate, with 68 percent 
choosing 
Clinton, 
whereas 

Republican presidential nominee 
Donald 
Trump 
received 
9 

percent. A significant number of 
respondents — 18 percent — said 
neither candidate performed well.

The 
Daily’s 
poll, 
however, 

showed that tuning into the debate 
didn’t necessarily equate to a 
change of preference. The majority 
— 59 percent — of respondents said 
the debate did not influence their 
vote, while 27 percent reported 
the debate somewhat influenced 
their vote and just 2 percent stated 
the debate greatly influenced their 
vote.

Aaron Kall, director of debate at 

the University of Michigan, agreed 
with respondents that Clinton won 
the debate. However, he added that 
the lack of lasting influence the 
debate had on young voters could 
prove problematic for Clinton 
moving forward.

“I think the main reason cutting 

into her support of younger voters 
are these third-party candidates 
and so debates are an excellent 
way for her to bring some of those 

candidates into the fold,” Kall said. 
“But if she’s not talking about issues 
and subjects that relate to them and 
they either don’t vote or vote for a 
third party, then she could be in 
real trouble.”

In the most recent survey of 

overall voter preference on campus 
conducted by the Daily on Sept. 
18, 80 percent of respondents said 
they would vote for Clinton, while 
her primary opponent Trump 
received 9 percent when only 
given the choice of the major party 
candidate, with 11 percent voting 
“other.”

In the poll of students after last 

night’s debate, the “other” not 
present on the stage had a stronger 
showing: 67 percent of students 
favored Clinton, 14 percent favored 
Trump, and 19 percent said “other,” 
though it is important to note that 
the sample for the post-debate poll 
was different than the sample for 
the Sept. 18 poll and the former had 
double the number of respondents.

When asked which candidate 

has the better temperament to be 
president in the post-debate poll 
— something Trump repeatedly 
assured voters of during the debate 
— a majority chose Clinton over 
Trump, 75 percent to 7 percent 
respectively. Sixteen percent of 
respondents felt neither candidate 
has 
the 
temperament 
to 
be 

president.

In 
response 
to 
student 

favorability 
toward 
Clinton 

post-debate, 
Taiwo 
Dosunmu, 

communications 
director 
for 

University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, 
said 
he 
thought 

students had picked up on how well 
she performed and the qualities 
she possesses that would make 
her a better president than her 
opponent.

“Last night’s debate showed 

how unfit Donald Trump is to be 
president,” Dosunmu said. “The 
students surveyed by the Daily saw 
this clearly, and they saw — just 
as clearly — how well Secretary 
Clinton performed. She was calm, 
cool and collected. She displayed 
the command of policy details 
we have come to expect from her, 
while being humorous, likable and 
confident. It should be no surprise 
that a majority of respondents 
listed Clinton as their choice for 
president.”

In the Sept. 18 survey, students 

listed social issues, the economy 
and gun violence as the top three 
issues that mattered the most 
to them in this election — all of 
which were covered in the debate. 
The issue of college affordability, 
however, was only mentioned by 
Clinton briefly twice, and not by 
Trump at all.

Wednesday in East Lansing and 
Grand Rapids. Holton’s visit 
follows a recent one from Kaine, 
who came to campus two weeks 
ago, and precedes a Friday event 
in Novi featuring Republican 
nominee Donald Trump. In her 
remarks, Holton highlighted 
the importance of grassroots 
campaigning, and repeatedly 
asked the audience to continue 
to volunteer and encourage 
people in their lives to vote for 
Clinton.

“I’m going to talk about you,” 

she said. “You are the key to 
this election. You all know that, 
right? You all know Michigan 
is often the key to the national 
election.”

Mai Le, an attendee and Ann 

Arbor resident, said she found 
Holton’s message reassuring.

“I 
really 
think 
me 
and 

everyone in this room really 
want to see a Clinton campaign 
victory on November 8th,” she 
said. “Hearing how directly we 
are making a difference for the 
campaign was very inspiring.”

Over the past few decades, 

Michigan has been a blue state, 
except for a victory by President 
Ronald Regan in 1988. However, 
the GOP has dominated state-
level politics over the past few 
years, and Trump has stated he 
wants to flip Michigan several 
times. Nonetheless, Clinton has 
maintained a lead in the state 
against 
Trump 
throughout 

the election season. The most 
recent RealClearPolitics polling 
average shows Clinton leading 
by 4.7 points.

After 
the 
event, 
Holton 

repeated 
her 
emphasis 
on 

volunteering in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily, saying 
Michigan could determine the 
outcome of the election on a 
national scale.

“Michigan is a battleground 

state,” she said. “It always 
is like Virginia is. It’s just so 
important. We are fighting for 
votes everywhere. If Michigan 
supports Hillary Clinton, the 
nation will support Hillary 
Clinton, and she will be our next 
president.”

Students on campus have 

been actively involved in the 
election with organizations like 
the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Democrats 
hosting 
a 
series 
of 
voter 

registration drives. Additionally, 
the first Michigan Daily election 
survey indicated overwhelming 
support for Clinton among a 
sample of students.

Holton told the Daily she 

believes the student vote is 
valuable in the presidential race, 
but even more so in state and 
local elections.

“I’m really thrilled to hear 

that students are involved in 
the top of the ticket, but also 
we’ve got great candidates up 
and down the ticket,” she said. 
“Our students don’t always fully 
engage in those races … The 
student vote can really make 
a difference for that and it can 
really make a difference for the 
top of the ticket too. Students 
are our future, and when they 
participate, Democrats win.”

Ann Arbor resident Jane 

Campbell, an event attendee, 
said she believes candidates 
visiting the state indicates the 
significance of this election.

“It’s really important to see 

the major candidates and their 
surrogates here in Michigan, so 
that people can understand the 
seriousness of the election,” she 
said. “I do not understand how 
anyone cannot vote in this or 
any election.”

the audience of about 50 students, 
“Do you want to hear what Black 
people have to say?” One of the 
protest organizers also led a call-
and-response chant, including the 
statement, “Your life is not up for 
debate, neither is mine.”

The protest and debate came a 

day after racially charged posters 
were found in University buildings 
and 
around 
campus, 
which 

the University condemned in a 
statement Monday afternoon. A 
separate protest was held Monday 
night by students in response to 
the posters, and the College of 
Literature, Science and the Arts also 
hosted an event Tuesday night for 
students to discuss the fliers.

LSA 
senior 
Joshua 
Strup, 

president of the MPU, said the 
group made the decision to hold its 
debate before the racially charged 
incidents that have occurred at the 
University and Eastern Michigan 
University this past week. However, 
he added that he still supported 
going forward with it.

“We feel that it’s a disservice to 

the issue itself to shy away from it 
because of additional events that 
it deserves to be recognized, it 
deserves to be heard, it deserves to 
be discussed and to not do so would 
be a dismissive attitude,” he said.

The protest had a mixed impact 

on the debate, halting parts, but not 
all of it. For several minutes after 
the protesters entered the event, 
debaters continued to speak, while 
protesters 
continued 
chanting. 

Shortly after the chanting began, a 
new MPU speaker took the podium 
and 
engaged 
with 
protesters, 

asking questions and discussing 
the issues at hand. Protesters then 
took to the podium directly, and 
spoke one by one to a mostly quiet 
crowd, when a disagreement broke 
out over whether white people 
should be speaking at the event. 
The protesters began leaving the 
room shortly afterward, chanting 
as they went, and effectively ending 
the debate.

Standing outside the event while 

protesters were inside, University 
Spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said 
he thought it was positive that 

protesters and event organizers 
were engaging each other.

“As often happens on this 

campus, groups with different 
points of view find a way to get 
together,” he said. “The dialogue is 
really important. Listening as well 
as talking are important for both 
sides on this campus.”

Many protesters and audience 

members, however, said though the 
two groups had been in the same 
room, not much open dialogue had 
occurred.

LSA sophomore Allison Hellman, 

a MPU member, said she did not 
feel the protesters respected the 
decorum of debates, which resulted 
in four of the intended speakers not 
having the opportunity to speak.

“I thought the protest was fine,” 

she said. “I thought the initial 
coming in and saying their piece 
was fine. I had an issue with once 
they had said what they were 
supposed to, what they were going 
to say, continuing to impede civil 
discourse.”

LSA junior Corey Walker, who 

was an audience member, said after 
the event that he also did not support 
the disruptive nature of the protest.

“I am Black, so yeah, I want to 

make life for myself and my family 
better,” Walker said. “At the same 
time, I don’t necessarily think that 
their tactics are going to get us 
there simply because when you do 
things like what they did today, like 
shut down any type of discussion 
whatsoever, 
not 
being 
willing 

to 
listen, 
interrupting 
people, 

discounting facts, screaming and 
yelling in people’s faces, using 
profanity, trying to silence people’s 
voices, it doesn’t move the ball 
forward.”

Walker added that he felt the 

Black 
Lives 
Matter 
movement 

often follows this format, calling it 
unproductive to achieve long term 
goals.

“As demonstrated here today, I 

don’t think this movement is about 
bridging gaps or actually finding 
solutions to problems; I think it’s 
about people who have a specific 
agenda screaming and yelling, 
which is fine,” he said. “But in order 
to make progress, you have to set 
specific policy goals in order to 
think about what you want.”

LSA freshman Na’kia Channey, 

who spoke at the protest, said she 
wished more dialogue had occurred 
between audience members and 
protesters. Citing the disagreement 
that broke out over whether white 
students should have been able to 
talk during the protest, she said she 
thought the white students should 
have been allowed to ask relevant 
questions about the purpose of the 
protest and Black Lives Matter 
as a whole. This, she added, is 
important for allies to understand 
the movement.

“I know white people have 

questions about Black Lives Matter,” 
she said. “And though they can look 
stuff on the internet, I think it makes 
sense that we let them ask questions 
so we can tell them why they need 
to support our movement.”

However, she also noted the 

importance of incorporating Black 
voices in the conversation.

“I totally agree that Black voices 

need to be listened to,” she said. 
“It’s very important that when our 
narrativism is endured so often that 
we need people to finally listen to 
what we say.”

LSA 
junior 
Chanice 
Taylor, 

secretary of the Michigan chapter 
of the NAACP, said before the 
march she believes their actions 
were important as they attracted 
attention to racist events affecting 
the Black community on campus.

“I’m here to show my support and 

bring awareness that these things 
do happen on campus,” she said. 
“Although we are making strides as 
far as diversity, we still have a long 
way to go.”

Eastern 
Michigan 
University 

seniors Cina Webster and Kaya 
Mills also said they joined the 
protest because they thought the 
debate signified the need to raise 
awareness about these issues among 
the student body.

“Tonight showed that there is 

a ton of ignorance,” Webster said. 
“Willful ignorance.”

“This is only the first step,” 

Mills said. “We have to continue 
doing things like this, we can’t stop. 
Because if we stop, then they think 
‘Oh they’re satisfied.’ But we’re still 
dying.”

The truth about class

LAUREN SCHANDEVEL | OP-ED

B

ear with me for this 
metaphor.

Imagine you have two 

seeds. You plant one seed in a 
sunny patch of nutrient-rich soil 
and water it every day. You plant 
the other seed in a dark shed 
and neglect it for months. Not 
surprisingly, the first seed grows 
tall and healthy while the other 
does not.

Can you attribute the success 

of the first seed or the failure 
of the second to any inherent 
quality? Of course not; you 
provided the conditions, which 
produced the results.

Now imagine two children. 

One child grows up in a safe, 
affluent 
neighborhood 
and 

attends 
an 
excellent 
school, 

where they are encouraged to 
pursue their interests and given 
the resources necessary to do 
so. The other child grows up in a 
poverty-stricken 
neighborhood 

and 
attends 
a 
school 
with 

crumbling infrastructure, a poor 
student-to-teacher ratio and a 
shortage of even the most basic 
resources. The first child goes 
on to graduate from a renowned 
university and pursue a lucrative 
career that allows them to raise 
their children in an area similar 
to the one in which they grew up. 
The second child, on the other 
hand, does not graduate from 
high school and instead works 
a low-wage job and remains in 
their neighborhood, where they 
raise their children in precisely 
the same conditions.

Can we attribute the success 

of the first child or the perceived 
failure of the second to any 
inherent quality? Of course not; 
as with the seeds, we provided 
the conditions, which produced 
the results.

If the rationale of our metaphor 

holds, then why do we still 
operate under the assumption 
that one’s socioeconomic status 
is the product of one’s character? 
More specifically, why do we act 

as though poverty and wealth 
are deliberate choices, rather 
than phenomena created and 
perpetuated by a rigidly stratified 
class system?

For decades, we have blissfully 

and collectively operated under 
the assumption that America 
is a fruitful meritocracy where 
all dreams, no matter how 
ambitious, can be achieved with 
just the right amount of hard 
work and determination. This 
is the foundation on which our 
country was built, and its blind 
optimism resonates today with 
the same magnitude that it did 
more than 200 years ago. Our 
country’s elite are lauded for 
their 
competence 
while 
our 

poor are degraded for their 
deficiencies, all while those of us 
making the observations remain 
grossly unaware of how exactly 
our system works to maintain 
these inequalities.

Here is a bitter pill to swallow: 

America is an oligarchy in which 
a handful of (primarily wealthy 
and 
white) 
citizens 
inherit 

automatic and unlimited access 
to elite academic institutions, 
political influence and positions 
of power. Poor people and people 
of color are not left out because 
they do not have what it takes to 
thrive — they are left out because 
we never intended for them to 
thrive in the first place.

Now you may be asking 

yourself: “What about all of 
those inspiring stories I’ve heard 
in which someone who comes 
from next to nothing manages to 
succeed despite all odds?”

The answer lies within the 

question. These individuals are 
exceptions — not in the sense that 
they did not earn their success 
(if anything, they are especially 
deserving of it), but rather that 
their 
systemic 
disadvantage 

made the probability of their 
success far lesser than their more 
affluent counterparts.

Nevertheless, the myth of the 

American Dream demands a 
sacrifice, and these individuals 
are 
subsequently 
tokenized 

and heralded as examples of 
the culmination of hard work 
and “pulling oneself up by the 
bootstraps.” We parade them 
in front of their communities 
as if to say: “You could achieve 
the same results, you just didn’t 
work hard enough.”

So I’ll revisit the metaphor: 

If a seed grows in a dark room, 
is it viewed as a miracle or an 
expectation?

Think about it.
We are conditioned to believe 

that our every accomplishment 
is the product of our character 
alone rather than a combination 
of character and circumstance, 
of the resources we are given 
and the ways in which we 
utilize them. Not only does this 
mentality perpetuate the notion 
that the wealthy are inherently 
superior; it allows us to live 
comfortably in the presence of 
extreme poverty by blaming the 
poor for their own misfortunes.

If 
we 
can 
confront 
our 

perceptions of class head-on, 
work diligently to undo our 
inherited 
biases 
and 
unite 

to 
strengthen 
and 
elevate 

one another in a way that is 
productive and decent, then 
we can successfully develop 
solutions to the flaws in our 
system that threaten to divide us.

What are the consequences 

of allowing all of our seeds to 
grow in ideal conditions? Are 
we afraid some will crowd 
out others, that there is not 
enough sunlight and water to go 
around? Do we feel threatened 
by 
the 
prospect 
of 
equal 

opportunity? What will become 
of our garden?

I’ll tell you what will happen: 

It will grow bigger and more 
beautiful than ever before.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

Lauren Schandevel is an 

LSA sophomore.

E

arlier this year, George 
Will, the championed 
conservative columnist, 

announced he was leaving the 
Republican Party. “The long 
and the short of it is, as Ronald 
Reagan said when he changed 
his registration, I did not leave 
the 
Democratic 
Party, 
the 

Democratic Party left me,” Will 
responded to a shocked press. 
Reduced to an outsider within 
his own political family, Will 
evoked the father of modern 
conservatism to try and explain 
away his position.

We, 
too, 
are 
distraught 

Republicans, and have both 
served on the executive board 
for the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Republicans 
in the past.

But for us, supporting Donald 

Trump 
means 
abandoning 

our core principles of limited 
government, individual freedom 
and 
strong 
international 

leadership. Trump’s candidacy 
has left us and many other 
life-long Republicans with the 
vexing choice of voting for a 
candidate who is clearly unfit 
for the office or defying years 
of party loyalty. We believe in 
putting our nation over party 
identity.

Nevertheless, not all of our 

Republican-minded friends feel 
the same way we do. Two weeks 
ago, UMCR officially endorsed 
Mr. Trump and announced 
its intention to partner with 
Trump’s national campaign.

We respect UMCR’s decision 

to support Trump and its 
right to make that decision. If 
anything, the 2016 campaign 
has lacked the basic decency 
that should exist in any election 
— for the most part, voters’ 
opinions must be respected and 
left open for discussion. After 
all, if we expect any societal 
shift toward healthy debate to 
occur, then we must begin to 
ease the tense disapproval we 
place on those who oppose our 
personal viewpoints.

But while we respect the 

decision, we cannot support 
it. As former UMCR members, 
we are writing this column to 
other students who may find 
themselves similarly caught in 
the awkward position between 
loyalty and voting according to 
what their conscience tells them. 
We urge you to do the latter.

UMCR 
President 
Enrique 

Zalamea’s 
comment 
to 
the 

Michigan Review that “any 
Republican 
is 
better 
than 

Hillary 
Clinton” 
seems 
to 

exemplify many Republicans’ 
attitudes 
this 
election. 
But 

to us, it is far from clear that 
Mr. Trump can accurately be 

described as “Republican” in 
any way but nominally. His 
nomination was secured with 
about 56 percent of the popular 
vote in the primaries when just 
14.8 percent of eligible voters 
participated — numbers that 
hardly imply the blessing of the 
party’s constituents. Trump has 
never held office as a Republican 
and has, in the past, actually 
donated to Clinton’s campaigns. 

And while we take issue 

with many of Clinton’s policy 
proposals 
and 
high-profile 

episodes of impropriety, we 
have major concerns about the 
long-term impact of a Trump 
presidency on the United States. 
Trump has spent months trying 
to convince voters to let him 
“make America great again,” 
but his policies would likely 
produce the opposite outcome.

Trump blames both free trade 

agreements and low interest rates 
for the state of the economy — a 
state he seems to believe is much 
worse than it actually is. But 
dismantling 
the 
international 

trade laws that have governed 
peaceful global commerce since 
the end of World War II or raising 
interest rates prematurely risk 
throwing the U.S. economy into 
another recession.

And despite an emphasis 

on national security, Trump 
threatens 
our 
country’s 

safety 
through 
incendiary 

remarks and feckless “policy” 
proposals 
that 
scapegoat 

entire ethnicities, nationalities 
and religions for failures of 
international governance and 
unintended 
consequences 
of 

war. Trump demonstrates an 
alarming misunderstanding of 
foreign affairs and heaps praise 
on dictators while admonishing 
prisoners of war. In August, 
50 
former 
senior 
security 

officials 
publicly 
declared 

their unwillingness to support 
Trump, a candidate who, in their 
view, put the entire country’s 
security “at risk.” 

Above 
all, 
Trump 
has 

transformed our once cherished, 
civil, issues-focused process of 
selecting elected officials into a 
sideshow circus scene bent on 
increasing entertainment value 
and spreading fear and anxiety 
throughout the public.

The laundry list of concerns 

is 
seemingly 
unending: 
He 

poses a severe risk to global 
economic stability by way of 
his inexplicable comments on 
debt, trade, taxes and alliances; 
he exacerbates social tensions 
throughout the United States 
by pitting cultures and races 
against 
one 
another; 
his 

amateurish 
understanding 

of international conflicts and 

the rules of engagement are 
startling for a major presidential 
candidate; his overall vulgarity, 
crassness and egotism all affect 
his 
standing 
among 
world 

leaders and private American 
citizens alike, which hinders 
our ability to advance foreign 
and domestic interests.

Disregarding these obvious 

red 
flags, 
endorsements 
of 

Trump consistently paint him 
as a change agent who will be 
restrained by a powerful team of 
advisers and cabinet members. 
Unfortunately, this optimistic 
view is only a fool’s paradise.

If Mr. Trump chooses his 

cabinet as he has chosen his 
campaign team — which has 
included a former consultant 
to a Ukrainian autocrat and 
a man who was once charged 
with domestic violence — then 
the prospects for any sort of 
restraint are doomed. As for 
Trump’s role as a change agent, 
it is unfathomable to expect 
someone with zero political 
experience 
and 
a 
flagrant 

disregard for the truth or facts 
of any situation to bring about 
the type of change necessary to 
fix our country for the better.

We need someone who can 

bring opposite sides together. 
Donald Trump cannot do this. 
We need someone with the 
mental fortitude to stick by 
their core policy beliefs and 
compromise when necessary. 
Donald 
Trump 
cannot 
do 

this. We need someone who 
will represent peace to our 
neighbors and diplomacy to 
those who oppose us. Donald 
Trump cannot do this. We 
need a proven, level-headed, 
open-minded individual who 
recognizes the principles that 
built this nation from nothing 
into a superpower. Who we need 
is categorically the antithesis of 
Donald Trump.

The future looks considerably 

bleak 
for 
Republicans 
of 

our stripe. We still ascribe 
to the ideas that guided our 
party through the centuries, 
beginning with Lincoln, and 
we need candidates who will 
carry this tradition once again 
— Donald Trump will not. It is 
tough to be optimistic in such 
an uncertain and frustrating 
political climate. However, we 
cannot give up the efforts to ease 
the strangling tension within 
the country. Our goal now will 
be to move forward supporting 
responsible 
candidates 
with 

sensible policies, resisting the 
forces that seek to undo us.

This November, vote nation over party

VICTORIA NOBLE AND BEN KELLER | OP-ED

A

s a 3-year-old, I had a 
polarizing incident of 
accidental racism.

We had been learning about 

Martin Luther King Jr. and the 
civil rights movement 
during Black History 
Month in preschool. 
So, when my dad ran 
into one of his close 
business 
colleagues 

(a longtime local civil 
rights 
leader) 
one 

day, I asked a poorly 
phrased albeit well-
intentioned question 
for which I still feel 
guilt: 
“Dad, 
we’re 

supposed to be nice to 
Black people, right?”

My parents believe firmly in 

racial equality, and my Jewish 
roots tie me in many ways to 
the civil rights movement (more 
on this later). My dad was so 
embarrassed. 
He 
apologized 

profusely to his friend and then 
made sure I understood that, 
of course, all people were to be 
treated with the same level of 
respect, regardless of their skin 
color. I shouldn’t have had to ask.

Children’s 
minds 
are 

malleable. It was that easy to 
change the way I spoke about and 
understood race.

***
Too often, I think, white 

people 
feel 
defensive 
when 

they’re called out for “white 
privilege.” Many feel they’re 
being guilted for something 
totally beyond their control. I get 
it. I’ve been there. “White” is such 
a broad word that doesn’t capture 
the wide swath of backgrounds 
it represents — the U.S. Census 
classifies “white” as “a person 
having origins in any of the 
original peoples of Europe, the 
Middle East, or North Africa.”

As someone who is both 

culturally 
and 
religiously 

Jewish, my life of privilege 
growing up stems directly from 
the struggle of my people. My 
great-grandparents 
left 
the 

hardship and pogroms of Poland 
and Russia shortly before the 
Holocaust, and my grandfather 
grew up poor in Staten Island to 
immigrant parents who spoke 
Yiddish and alongside more 
traditionally American “white 
people” who beat him up for 
being a “dirty Jew.”

Knowing my family story, 

and having awareness of the 
cyclical persecution of Jews 
over thousands of years, there 
was a time where I felt defensive 

about 
being 
called 

out 
for 
“white 

privilege” 
because 

I 
was 
reluctant 

to 
let 
my 
current 

societal 
standing 

supplant a much more 
complicated 
history 

that is such a big part 
of my identity.

Ultimately, though, 

it’s 
important 
to 

understand 
that 

there is a difference 

between 
generalizing 
white 

culture (and its numerous ethnic, 
socioeconomic, etc. backgrounds) 
and recognizing that the mere 
appearance of whiteness is a 
safeguard in and of itself.

We shouldn’t shy away from 

acknowledging “white privilege” 
— it exists. It is our responsibility, 
then, to be an ally to those whose 
voices aren’t as easily heard. We 
must employ our privilege to 
share their perspectives when 
they don’t have a platform to do 
so, until the time comes when 
that’s no longer necessary. This is 
admittedly easier said than done.

***
My only excuse for my 3-year-

old folly is innocent, accidental 
ignorance. 
However, 
that 

ignorance is something I was 
almost 
immediately 
coached 

out of, and it’s a mistake I revisit 
somewhat often, most recently 
after fliers that directly targeted 
people of color were posted in 
Mason Hall.

One sheet explained “Why 

White Women Shouldn’t Date 
Black Men,” and another called 
for “Euro-Americans” to stop 
“apologizing,” “living in fear” 
and “denying your heritage.” “BE 
WHITE,” the latter read.

There is no excuse for the fliers 

posted on our campus. There is 
no excuse for people who not only 
remain willfully and aggressively 
ignorant, but also encourage and 
espouse ignorance.

Very rarely, if ever, do children 

ask if it is OK to “be nice to” a 
white person. I can’t imagine how 
my dad’s friend must have felt to 
hear a 3-year-old kid ask that.

Very rarely, if ever, do white 

people sincerely fear for their 
lives when they get pulled over by 
a police officer. My parents don’t 
worry I’ll be killed if I’m caught 
running a stop sign.

Very rarely, if ever, based on 

Intergroup 
Relations 
training 

I’ve done as a student at this 
University, do white people get 
asked where they’re “from, from” 
as if their home state must not be 
their place of official origin.

If there’s one thing that I’d 

like people to learn from 3-year-
old me, it’s that ignorance 
and 
insensitivity 
to 
others’ 

experiences can be overcome. 
A lesson I’ve picked up from 
my peers in the last few years 
regarding issues of identity, from 
race to religion to gender, is that 
it’s OK to feel uncomfortable, 
and it’s OK if you don’t know 
someone else’s life experiences 
— provided that you make an 
effort to educate yourself.

Ask the questions you think 

might be stupid. Stumble upon a 
microaggression, but understand 
when someone reacts adversely 
and listen to them explain why 
what you’ve said is hurtful. Listen. 
Listen to others’ perspectives, 
and if you can’t empathize, 
sympathize. And when the time 
comes, spread your newfound 
knowledge to the people who 
stand where you once did.

I want to be optimistic.
My 
hypothesis 
is 

that 
ignorance 
sprouts 

from 
any 
combination 
of 

misunderstanding, 
resistance 

to change or even fear of that 
which 
seems 
unknown 
or 

different, and my hope is that 
we can help those with fear or 
even indifference in their hearts 
understand and acknowledge 
their unfounded biases in an 
effort to subvert even the most 
poisonous of thoughts.

At a time when racial disparities 

in this country are so much more 
complex and nuanced than 50 
years ago, yet simultaneously just 
as pronounced — and a time when 
racial and cultural division seems 
to be growing — it is important 
that people of all colors speak out 
and unite to work through our 
problems together. I believe in us.

Every once in awhile, a 

band will release an album 
whose cover art is more than 
impressive. Rather than simply 
putting a pretty picture to a 
collection of songs, it profoundly 
influences 
the 
listening 

experience. 
Perhaps 
it 
invites, 

intrigues 
or 

just 
mystifies. 

In the best of 
cases, it evokes 
an 
emotional 

response 
from 

the 
listener 

before the music even starts. 
Whatever the exact case may 
be, Return to Love is one of 
those albums. Illustrated in 
immensely 
satisfying 
detail 

and contained by a thick white 
border, the cover’s naturescape 
is a crucial, almost necessary 
introduction 
to 
the 
album. 

Invoking 
nature 
and, 
by 

extension, solitude, it primes 
the listener for an experience 
centered 
on 
self-discovery. 

At the same time, the pure 
whiteness 
that 
surrounds 

this image indicates a crisp, 
aesthetically intelligent quality, 
setting a standard that the 
music itself surely matches.

On Return to Love, LVL 

UP’s third studio album and 
first for Sub Pop, the four-
piece outfit finds a highly 
rewarding 
medium 
between 

fuzz-infused punk bombast and 
lo-fi subtlety. After meeting at 
 

SUNY Purchase in New York, 
Mike Caridi, Dave Benton and 
Nick Corbo joined forces as LVL 
UP and introduced themselves 
to the world on 2011’s quietly 
released 
Space 
Brothers, 
an 

album 
comprised 
almost 

entirely of quick in-and-out jams 
— its 13 tracks clock in at just 
over 23 minutes total. Drummer 
Greg Rutkin joined them on tour 

— he’s now a permanent fixture 
in the band — though he doesn’t 
write any of the material. The 
other three split song-writing 
responsibilities roughly evenly, 
which is surprising given the 
generally cohesive nature of 
their 
work 
together. 
Now, 

following 2014’s breakthrough 

Hoodwink’d, Return 
to Love finds LVL 
UP crafting the most 
fleshed out, lyrically 
complex 
material 

they’ve released to 
date.

Opening on single 

“Hidden 
Driver,” 

the 
influence 
of 

’90s 
fuzz-folk 

is 
immediately 

apparent; one almost expects 
Jeff Mangum to jump in with a 
nasally “two-headed boy” after 
the opening chords. LVL UP’s 
lyrics are also just as inscrutable 
as Mangum’s always were. For 
a brief taste: “Hidden driver / 
forming shape inside my chest 
/ omnipotent in the way that it 
arrests / every sense and every 
lesson.” The exact meaning 
of these opening lines doesn’t 
ever become particularly clear, 
but the song finds the band 
grappling with the idea of god — 
God? — and the biblical Fall.

While fuzz permeates the 

album, some tracks are also 
characterized by touches of 
synthesizer. An absolute master 
class on restraint, the playful 
synth line that comes in at the 
two-minute mark (and only 
appears twice) on “She Sustains 
Us” is a testament to LVL UP’s 
arguably newfound maturity. 
This synth in particular, as well 
as other artificial sounds that 
crop up here and there — the 
sample that opens the track, for 
example — also add an exciting, 
almost genre-defying dimension 
to the band’s overall vibe.

Despite all of the change 

or 
deviation 
from 
previous 

direction 
that 
characterizes 

Return 
to 
Love, 
longtime 

fans need not be in dismay! 
Fuzz permeates, but refuses 
to dominate, and tracks like 
“Cut from the Vine” find more 
of the clean, singular guitar 
melodies that largely defined 
their previous releases. What’s 
more, the band members’ voices 
haven’t changed a bit. Still the 
perfect complement for their 
guitar-driven brand of quasi-
punk, their voices are never 
particularly urgent, and remain 
constant while the guitars set 
the emotional tone.

Bordering on monotone, LVL 

UP’s laid-back, gently lilting 
vocals bring a casual quality 
to an album whose thematic 
content could be considered 
anything but. Here, LVL UP 
confront the idea of a higher 
being on “Hidden Driver” and 
condemn someone who has 
recently betrayed a friend to 
“grow old and never find love.” 
In addition to covering all of 
the usual bases of indie lo-fi 
alt-rock, the band has widened 
their focus, singing beyond just 
their own distinctly personal 
experiences. 
They 
continue 

to embrace individuality, but 
have contextualized it with the 
knowledge of a much greater, 
much 
more 
significant 
and 

unpredictable unknown. The 
idea of a singular, omnipotent 
deity 
appears 
not 
only 
on 

“Hidden Driver”—see “Naked in 
the River with the Creator” and 
“Cut from the Vine — and could 
reflect the instability ubiquitous 
in recent years for the four New 
Yorkers. In interviews, they 
have said that they decided they 
would be going their separate 
ways if things didn’t come 
together. Thankfully, signing 
to Sub Pop seems to have had 
more of a humbling effect 
than an ego-inflating one. In 
small print — at the bottom 
of the aforementioned album 
cover, beneath the river, the 
mountains and the entirety of 
the lush landscape — are two 
words: “Thank you.”

FOCUS FEATURES

“As you can see here, we’re very lost.”

Completionism: the act of 

consuming all works by an 
artist, film director or musician.

Here is a completionist’s 

confession: I have refrained 
from watching films I knew 
would 
be 
good 
because 
I 

hadn’t watched their directors’ 
previous films. The same is true 
for albums and bands. I have, 
conversely, watched countless 
films I was 99 percent sure 
would be terrible beforehand 
(and those predictions were 
mostly right).

I 
suppose 
my 
obsession 

with completion goes back to 
“Moonrise Kingdom,” the 2012 
film by Wes Anderson, which 
was the movie that got me into 
movies. When I was younger, 
my form of rebellion against 
my parents was to reject their 
offers to watch movies with 
them in theaters or on home 
video. Unfortunately for me, my 
mother studied film in college, 
so her film literacy and taste 
have struck me as superlatively 
impressive since I developed an 
interest in film. In other words, 
I missed out.

But when I saw a trailer for 

“Moonrise Kingdom,” a twee 
love story between two young 
troubled teenagers on a New 
England island in the summer 
of 1965, my interest in film 
blossomed. I never acted on the 
desire — the demands of my high 
school debate schedule proved to 
be too much of an obstacle — but 
“Moonrise Kingdom” remained 
in the back of my mind, waiting 
to be serviced.

About a year later, in my 

senior year of high school, 
the film started appearing on 
television and I recorded it. 
Upon watching that fateful 
recording, I understood like 

never before how films could 
be so transforming. As soon 
as the film finished, I scoured 
the internet for all of Wes 
Anderson’s other films. For a 
few days before first semester 
finals, I locked myself in my 
room and watched all his works 
— “Rushmore” and “Fantastic 
Mr. 
Fox” 
made 
particular 

impressions on me — all while 
remaining keenly aware that 
a new film of his, “The Grand 
Budapest Hotel,” was due to be 
released in a few short months. I 
became obsessed.

That directorial deep dive 

has never left me. In the years 
since, captivated by a singular 
film and determined to watch 
the 
director’s 
remaining 

filmography, I have watched the 
works of Steven Spielberg, Noah 
Baumbach, the Coen Brothers, 
Terrence Malick, Woody Allen 
and countless others. There’s 
a certain joy in truly knowing 
a director. Freed from the 
blind spots of one’s neophyte 
friends, the completionist can 
trace the styles, subjects and 
collaborators of directors from 
small, hobbled-together debut to 
peak artistic craft (note: usually, 
but certainly not always, around 
the third or fourth film), to late-
period gem.

There are, of course, short-

comings. Not all films by a 
director — even some of the best 
directors — are good. There’s a 
lot of suffering in dedication. 

But those who find themselves 
in a deep dive can find some-
thing to love in any film by a 
director to whom they commit 
themselves. I don’t particularly 
love “The Darjeeling Limited,” a 
mediocre film by Wes Anderson, 
but its style adds to the broader 
tapestry of Anderson’s twee 
works and his oeuvre would 
probably be worse without it.

And I suppose it starts ear-

lier: my first art love was archi-
tecture and it still captivates me 
today. Growing up in the envi-
rons of Chicago, an architec-
tural mecca, I was exposed to 
countless works by Ludwig Mies 
van der Rohe and Frank Lloyd 
Wright. A life goal of mine is to 
see every Frank Lloyd Wright 
building ever built (and still in 
existence).

I’ve adapted the deep dive to 

music, too. Over the summer, 
my boss, in a company meeting, 
referenced Neil Young, and then 
looked at me and asked, in an 
apparent slight to my age, “Do 
you even know who Neil Young 
is?” I do in fact know who Neil 
Young is, but I couldn’t name any 
songs by him or Buffalo Spring-
field. As much as I claim to love 
the rock ‘n’ roll of the 1960s and 
1970s, I’m clearly missing many 
key names. I decided to listen to 
the discographies of all the art-
ists inducted into the Rock and 
Roll Hall of Fame. I started in 
June with Chuck Berry, moved 
into James Brown and now I’m 
working through Ray Charles. 
It’s taking forever: three artists 
over four months.

And yet, it’s been fruitful. 

These are legends, individu-
als whose work changed music 
forever. Art is a cyclical phe-
nomenon of copying, inspira-
tion and innovation. We owe it 
to ourselves to experience the 
enlightenment of discovery. The 
best place to start is with the 
masters.

“How does my breath smell?”

Movies 
about 
the 
elderly 

and teenagers are hard to get 
right. When they are successful, 
however, it feels even more 

rewarding. With elders, there 
are inevitable biases that explain 
why movies starring older actors 
(besides Michael Caine, Meryl 
Streep or Morgan Freeman) are 
less common. Essentially, viewers 
would 
rather 
watch 
young, 

beautiful actors in roles that 
don’t remind us of our impending 
death (or inevitable wrinkles). 
Jerry Lewis attempts to negate 
this with his performance in 
“Max Rose.” Sadly, any producer 
who sees the movie will be far 

WILL STEWART

For the Daily

Jerry Lewis doesn’t defend his icon 
status in 2013’s bland ‘Max Rose’

After premiering at Cannes, the film finally receives wide release

from eager to finance an elderly-
focused movie anytime soon.

Jerry Lewis’s (“The Nutty 

Professor”) career spans over 
half a century. From his work 
in the ’50s with 
Dean 
Martin 
to 

his 
philanthropy, 

Lewis 
has 
been 

one of the most 
prolific comedians. 
Today — although 
few 20-something 
year olds are fans 
— his name is still 
relevant.

“Max 
Rose”, 

written and directed by Daniel 
Noah (“A Girl Who Walks Home 
at Night”), stars Lewis as the 
titular character, a 90-year-old 
widower struggling through day-
to-day life. Lewis ventures away 
from comedy to more serious 
territory here, and his fans will 
be disappointed by the result. 
The movie premiered at Cannes 
in 2013, though it only recently 
gained wide distribution. What 
happened during these three 
years in between is unknown; 
unfortunately, 
“Max 
Rose” 

should have never made it past 
Cannes.

The 
movie 
begins 
with 

a 
montage 
of 
sentimental 

flashbacks of Max’s recently 
deceased wife that’s meant to 
tug at the viewer’s heartstrings, 
similar to the opening sequence 

of Pixar’s “Up.” However, unlike 
“Up,” “Max Rose” fails to come 
even close to as heartbreaking. 
His 
granddaughter 
Annie, 

lackadaisically played by Kerry 

Bishé 
(“Argo”), 

takes 
care 
of 

Max despite his 
stubbornness. The 
movie 
revolves 

around 
Lewis 

trying to construe 
clues of his wife’s 
infidelity 50 years 
ago. This plotline 
feels meaningless 
and does nothing to 

deepen the love Max Rose felt for 
his wife. Rather, viewers spend 
the entire time wondering why he 
even cares about this past scandal 
since his wife has just died.

The performances in “Max 

Rose” are the most painful 
feature. Lewis tries to express 
Max’s depression and mourning, 
but it never feels believable. The 
dialogue only fuels the poor 
acting; 
every 
sentence 
feels 

forced and unnatural, and every 
statement is overly dramatic, as 
if it were a part of a speech. His 
son, Christopher (Kevin Pollak, 
“A Few Good Men”), is especially 
guilty of supplying the worst 
lines, with small talk that feels 
like something overheard on an 
awkward first date. His deliveries 
are so unrealistic that it’s always 
clear that he is, in fact, acting in 

front of a camera with a film crew 
behind him.

“Max Rose” feels half-baked 

at best, almost like Noah failed to 
make a deadline in its production. 
Its plot is choppy and its acting 
feels like it was barely rehearsed. 
Even with fine tune-ups, it is 
unlikely that “Max Rose” would 
ever be a successful movie; it 
would take an entire overhaul.

Max Rose, the character, lacks 

any redeeming qualities, so much 
so that I hope no one I know 
ages like him. The movie does 
nothing to comment on the pains 
of getting old and portrays elders 
as 
stubborn 
and 
unpleasant, 

characteristics that should not be 
the only takeaways. There is no 
authentic development between 
Max’s family, and his friendships 
feel unrealistic. If “Max Rose” 
was trying to increase empathy 
toward elders, it failed.

“Max Rose” is nothing but a 

brief glitch in Lewis’s expansive 
career. As a comedian with a 
plethora of material, the movie 
will be quickly forgotten in his 
legacy. Considering that this 
could be one of Lewis’s last 
performances, viewers and fans 
will want to like it, but it isn’t 
worth pretending. Liking “Max 
Rose” only because Lewis is old 
is purposeless; fans will always 
be able to revisit their favorite 
material and enrich their lives 
with laughter.

Having an account on social 

media is like living a double life. 
On the internet and our mobile 
devices, we show the parts of 
ourselves that we want people 
to see, but not necessarily the 
entire picture of who we are. 
We 
frequently 
display 
the 

good parts of ourselves, not 
the more vulnerable aspects of 
our personality and daily life. 
Essentially, what we create, 
produce and express online 
becomes our virtual identity.

Since the dawn of the modern 

selfie, Instagram has become 
one of the more prominent 
determinants of virtual identity 
in the digital age, totaling 
about 400 million users since 
December 2015. Facebook and 
Twitter 
have 
given 
people 

the agency to connect with 
friends and post their personal 
thoughts on specific issues, 
but Instagram has been the 
forefront of showcasing the 
image and lifestyle of a person.

 Along with every other 

social 
networking 
site/app, 

Instagram is a program that 
feeds us the autonomy to 
present what we want to our 
friends and followers through 
sharing 
photos 
underscored 

with funny, witty and thought-
provoking captions. But more 
importantly, it’s how we present 
ourselves on Instagram that 
dictates the kind of person we 
want to be perceived as online. 
Two recently growing trends 
on Instagram, “finstas” and 
“thirst traps,” have established 
just how our virtual identities 
can either feel genuine or 
excessively distorted. 

Finstas? Thirst traps? What 

are these strange words you 
speak of? Don’t worry, Baby 
Boomers and Gen-Xers. Let me 
break it down. A “finsta” is short 
for “finstagram,” a combination 
of “fake” and “Instagram”; 
the word itself refers to a 
second, 
private 
Instagram 

account users create in order 
to post funny, embarrassing 
photos of themselves, only for 
their closest friends to see. 
Though a finsta is deemed as 
something “fake,” the irony of 
it is that a finsta account is the 

closest thing your friends have 
to seeing an unfiltered, real 
version of yourself.

“Finstas 
provide 
an 

opportunity 
to 
post 
things 

without the typical barriers of 
social media,” said Engineering 
senior Susan Rusinowski. “It 
allows users to reclaim the 
platform and have fun without 
the fear of being judged.”

Rusinowski is among the 

multitude 
of 
mostly 
high 

school 
and 
college-aged 

students around the country 
who’ve 
created 
a 
finsta 

account. In addition to being 
more 
unfiltered 
(literally 

and 
figuratively), 
finstas 

are also less concerned with 
creating and publishing the 
perfect 
picture 
with 
the 

perfect caption, acting almost 
like a personal photo diary 
exclusively for the eyes of the 
users and a select group of 
people. In fact, finstas can even 
have the power to build self-
esteem. Rusinowski notes that 
having a finsta has made her 
a lot more open about herself, 
as well as less embarrassed at 
funny or unflattering pictures 
of herself on social media.

“It’s forced me to be more 

real about my day to day 
life on social media and feel 
more comfortable laughing at 
myself,” she said.

This contrasts greatly to 

the other popular trend on 
Instagram, the “thirst trap,” 
which, according to Urban 
Dictionary, 
is 
any 
photo 

or 
statement 
on 
a 
social 

media 
platform, 
especially 

on 
Instagram, 
posted 
to 

intentionally create attention 
or “thirst.” A thirst trap can 
be anything as suggestive as 
a steamy workout selfie or as 
explicit as an almost completely 
nude, 
just-got-out-of-the-

shower photo.

Make no mistake: thirst traps 

are not the same as ordinary 
Instagram users posting selfies. 
There’s 
a 
huge 
difference 

between posting a selfie for 
the sake of attention, showing 
off your sexiness, a photo blog 
tracking your health and fitness 
progress or a post with a body-
positive message. In any case, 
posting photos of yourself is in 
and of itself a form of flaunting. 

Yet thirst trappers capitalize on 
this flaunting by objectifying 
their bodies and publishing 
totally perfected versions of 
themselves. 

Take English thirst trapper 

Liam Jolley (132k followers), 
for example. Nearly all of the 
photos that appear on his 
Instagram profile are shirtless, 
nearly nude pictures of himself, 
whether at the gym, in the 
bathroom or by a luxurious 
pool (note: the phrase “TURN 
ON POST NOTIFICATIONS” 
is emblazoned in his bio). 
Most thirst trappers, such as 
Jolley, attempt to relate to 
their audience, captioning their 
photos with common phrases 
or an abundance of hashtags, 
even when they have literally 
nothing to do with the photos 
themselves.

While 
thirst 
traps 
may 

have the most benevolent of 
intentions, they can have a 
negative, 
even 
detrimental 

impact on the users themselves, 
as it can affect men and women 
suffering from body dysmorphia 
and eating disorders. A recent 
article on Out.com changed 
that 
most 
thirst 
trappers, 

predominantly gay men, are 
suffering from body dysmorphia, 
having to exercise and take 
photos of themselves constantly 
in order to feel somewhat better 
about their self-perception.

This all goes back to this 

idea of not just how we want 
to present ourselves on social 
media, but whether or not we are 
willing to be more vulnerable 
on our online accounts. Based 
on my observations, I find that 
finstas allows us to embrace our 
flaws, while regular Instagram 
allows us to hide them, and 
thirst traps allows us to repress 
them excessively. Sure, it’s nice 
to look at attractive people and 
there’s almost nothing like the 
dopamine rush you get when 
your profile picture or the 
gorgeous pic you took of the 
sky gets a ton of likes. Then 
again, anything we post, publish 
and 
share 
isn’t 
necessarily 

100 percent of who we are. 
Sometimes, it’s who we want to 
be. Though it may be impossible, 
we should strive to at least try 
to be the realest person we can 
be on social media.

American history and mythology 
to create original productions 
that comment on modern issues. 
From these stories spring themes 
of hardship and triumph meant to 
inspire new ideas and challenge 
the status quo.

Centering 
around 
a 

hallucinated 
journey, 

“RoosevElvis” focuses on two 
characters: Ann, an introverted 
meat-processing 
worker, 
and 

Brenda, a taxidermist with a 
bubbly personality who grew 
up in North Dakota. When 
Ann and Brenda decide to take 
their imaginary adventure to 
Graceland, they choose to embody 
the personas of Elvis Presley and 
his idol, Theodore Roosevelt, 
respectively.

In an interview, Libby King, 

who plays Ann/Elvis, described 
what it’s like to play two different 
characters in one.

“I am doing things that I would 

never be comfortable doing,” she 
said, like dancing on stage as a 

confident 
figure 

with “male energy.” 
Despite her fun role 
as 
Elvis 
Presley, 

King also has the 
challenge of playing 
Ann.

“The 
harder 

parts 
are 
Ann’s 

character 
and 

her 
story… 
she’s 

incredibly 
lonely. 

But there is a lot of 
loss in Ann’s life 
and Elvis’ life,” she 

said.

King co-lead for “RoosevElvis,” 

Kristen Sieh also designed the 
costumes for this show, including 
her own character of Brenda/
Teddy.

“I always try to think in this 

sense of stage picture or ways that 
design can communicate story 
or feeling,” she said, adding that 
her character Teddy is “trying to 
be a badass in the West,” and she 
is “always keeping in mind of the 
constraints of the kind of clothing 
people would wear in the 1870s.

Alongside King and Sieh is 

associate director Jake Margolin 
and director and co-writer, Rachel 
Chavkin. The winner of two Obie 
Awards, Chavkin has directed 
many shows not only for The 
TEAM, but other off-Broadway 
production groups. Nevertheless, 
“RoosevElvis” is a show that is 

different from the rest.

“ ‘RoosevElvis’ is the most 

intimate work The TEAM has 
made … not only in terms of the 
vibe, but the fact that there were 
only four of us in the room writing 
this together.”

The show stands in a category 

of its own for many reasons: 
a two-woman show with four 
characters, 
the 
experimental 

use of light, design, music and 
choreography and the modern 
themes of gender, sex and identity. 

“The demand for consistent 

emotional 
and 
intellectual 

complexity, nuance upon nuance 
and layering upon layering of 
image and language … that is a 
thing I don’t find anywhere else,” 
Chavkin said.

From touring in places like 

London and Boston, The TEAM 
is anticipating a different and 
younger audience here in Ann 
Arbor.

Because the show exemplifies a 

powerful theme in self-discovery, 
having an audience on a college 
campus goes hand in hand with 
the concept that young people 
are “still solidifying their sense of 
self,” Sieh said.

In addition to the show, there 

will be a Q&A on Thursday, 
with The TEAM. Given their 
excitement for a younger crowd 
and the show’s discussion of 
gender 
archetypes, 
Chavkin 

finished the interview with one 
question in mind: “It feels like 
there is such a live conversation 
that 
gets 
at 
the 
center 
of 

Americans … who gets to be a hero 
in America? That, for me, is really 
the heart of this.”

“I’m now realizing we’ll never be ‘How to Get Away With Murder.’ “

Fall TV season is here, and with 

it comes the return of series with 
vague, dramatic, one-word titles. 
Turn on “Scandal” 
or “Revenge,” and 
the next 40-some 
minutes 
will, 

without 
doubt, 

be 
filled 
with 

blackmail, 
not-

so-secret 
affairs 

and, if we’re lucky, 
a 
mysterious 

disappearance. 
While these high-
drama 
shows 

border on ridiculous, they do 
promise to be entertaining. At the 
very least, they should deliver on 
some good, old-fashioned, heart-
wrenching angst, however ABC’s 
new drama series “Notorious” 
falls short of even the bare 
minimum.

“Notorious” centers around 

the 
(corrupt) 
relationship 

between a news producer and 
criminal justice lawyer, working 
together to influence the media. 
The lawyer Jake Gregorian (Dan-
iel Sunjata, “Graceland”) is able 
to control his clients’ public per-
ceptions, while producer Julia 
George (Piper Perabo, “Covert 
Affairs”) gets insider tips on 

breaking stories. Jake and Julia, 
characters that creator Josh Bur-
man (“Drop Dead Diva”) based on 
celebrity attorney Mark Geragos 
and “Larry King Live” producer 
Wendy Walker, write a narrative 

absent of ethics, 
morals and integ-
rity. Sexy, right?

Wrong. 
The 

series 
kicks 
off 

with a pilot that 
stuffs in one pre-
dictable twist after 
another, throwing 
originality out the 
window and set-
tling for less than 
mediocre. All the 

boxes for “just another network 
drama” are neatly checked off: 
the high-profile murder, the 
unprofessional affair, the threat-
ening blackmail. The “surpris-
ing” developments come and 
go so fast that any semblance 
of anticipation or heat simmers 
down to nothing. As the series 
attempts to move at a fast and 
exciting pace, the “Notorious” 
pilot becomes a textbook case of 
quantity over quality, confusing 
lies for drama and power for sex 
appeal.

While the drama attempts 

(and fails) to hit the audience 
with punchy plot lines, character 
development 
is 
completely 

neglected. By the end of the 
pilot, Jake and Julia still read 
completely flat as Perabo and 
Sanjata deliver lines that are 
painfully 
overdramatized. 

Without any insight into their 
backstory or the foundation of 
their relationship, the audience 
is unable to connect with the 
two main characters, who are 
seemingly driven only by power 
and success. The pilot does not 
create a deeper understanding 
of their motivations, nor does 
it allow viewers to empathize 
with the backhanded way Jake 
and Julia go about reaching 
their goals. There’s no chemistry 
on a personal or professional 
level, 
making 
their 
super-

secret relationship hard to buy. 
Unfortunately, 
they’re 
just 

boring.

“Notorious” has some big 

shoes to fill as it stands in for 
“Scandal” on ABC’s coveted 
TGIT 
lineup 
of 
Shondaland 

shows. But despite the beautiful 
people and high-drama plotline 
that fall suspiciously close to 
the 
Shondaland 
structure, 

“Notorious” 
is 
not 
even 
in 

the same ballpark as Shonda 
Rhimes’s series. The characters 
are weak, the story directionless 
and the drama convoluted. After 
only one episode, “Notorious” 
already tastes stale.

‘Notorious’ is far from 
Shondaland’s elite work

Lewis battling through rust from injury

Jourdan Lewis is 21 years old 

and listed at 5 feet 11 inches, 
186 pounds. He’s one of college 
football’s top athletes at one of 
its most challenging positions 
— cornerback — and is in what 
most people would call the best 
shape of their lives.

And 
yet, 
speaking 
to 
a 

group of reporters Tuesday, he 
sounded like a man starting to 
feel his age.

“As a freshman, I felt like I 

never had to pay attention to 
anything like (taking care of 
my body),” Lewis said. “Just go 
out there and play. But now I 
have to go out there and warm 
up 30 minutes before I get out 
there. … I can’t eat everything 
now, my metabolism is slowing 
down, I’ve been getting a little 
bigger.”

Lewis made his return to 

action Saturday against Penn 
State after missing the season’s 
first three games with nagging 
injuries that trace back to his 
core.

He wasn’t pleased with his 

performance — which saw him 
record a tackle for loss and 
break up a pass — and admitted 
some rust. He was unabashed in 
conceding he held a Penn State 
receiver, due in part to that rust. 
And he especially wasn’t shy in 
saying that he felt his soreness 
after the game.

“My first game back, it really 

hurt,” Lewis said. “I have to be 
honest. I haven’t been through 
anything physically (challenging) 
like that in a while.”

Lewis is lucky, though, to get 

that rust out in a 39-point win. 
His next game may not allow for 
him to be so cavalier in taking or 
admitting penalties.

Michigan has blown through 

its 
first 
four 
opponents, 

winning by a combined margin 
of 153 points. But when No. 
8 
Wisconsin 

comes to town, 
the Wolverines 
will be facing 
a 
team 
that 

is 
capable 
of 

burning them on 
both sides of the 
ball.

With redshirt 

freshman 
quarterback Alex Hornibrook 
now under center, the Badgers 
spread 
the 
ball 
around 
in 

their 30-6 win over then-No. 
8 Michigan State on Saturday. 
Five different receivers had 

at 
least 
two 

catches, 
led 

by junior Jazz 
Peavy, who had 
four receptions 
for 96 yards.

Peavy, listed 

at 6-foot-1, is one 
of many Badger 
receivers 
who 

will 
pose 
a 

physical 
challenge 
for 
the 

Michigan secondary. And with 
the Wolverines losing their 

tallest 
cornerback, 
Jeremy 

Clark, for the season with an 
ACL injury, Lewis will need to 
be at the top of his game in a 
hurry.

“We’re really preparing for 

those receivers,” Lewis said. 
“Those guys are big and physical 
and fast.”

While Lewis says he normally 

likes to lead by example — and 
All-American play is not a bad 
example to set — his injury 
forced him to become more 
vocal early in the season.

“If you can’t go out there and 

play, you have to impact the 

team in different ways,” Lewis 
said. “So I definitely was more 
vocal in trying to inspire those 
guys to play at their best.”

Now Lewis is back on the 

field, and he can go back to 
letting his play do the talking. 
He was not satisfied with his 
first game back, saying he wants 
to be more technically sound 
going forward.

But Lewis’s most important 

plays are no doubt ahead of him.

“I feel like I’m at full speed,” 

Lewis said. “Does it hurt a little 
bit? Yeah. But you have to play 
through that a little bit.”

Wisconsin native Bredeson ready for Badgers

March 1, 2014, is a day 

that Wisconsin native Ben 
Bredeson will never forget. It 
was the day that the football 
team he rooted for as a child, 
the 
Badgers, 
gave 
him 
a 

scholarship to play football. 

But a lot can change in two 

years. Instead of suiting up in 
Wisconsin red and white, he’s 
playing for the No. 4 Michigan 
football team as a left guard. 
There are many factors that 
went into his choice to play 
for the Wolverines, with their 
brand new coaching staff being 
the main determinant. 

So far, the decision is paying 

off. 

Most 
true 
freshmen 

offensive linemen don’t get 
the opportunity to play, but 
Bredeson has appeared in every 
game this season as relief for 
an experienced line. This week, 
he will prepare for the eighth-
ranked Badgers in the first top-
10 matchup of his career. 

“I’ve been getting texts since 

the beginning of the year from 
people who are excited about 
the game,” Bredeson said. “Not 
anyone who’s on the team, but 
just friends from back home. 
The majority — I think like a 
third of my graduating class — 
all went to Madison, so I have 
a lot of friends from the school, 
and I’m pretty excited about it.”

Bredeson has a lot of friends 

and family coming out to Ann 
Arbor for the weekend, and 
though they may have always 
rooted for Wisconsin growing 
up in Hartland, he’s giving 
them a reason to question their 
fandom — if friends of the 
Bredeson family didn’t already 
have enough. 

Ben’s brother, Jack, is a 

sophomore right-handed pitcher 
for the Michigan baseball team. 

“I was going to come here 

anyway,” Ben said. “But (having 
Jack on campus) has helped a 
lot. He’s given me the lay of the 
land and it’s nice to have a close 
family member here, so when 
you just need someone from 
home, you can call him.”

The brothers played hockey 

and football together often, but 
Ben never dabbled in baseball. 
He says he’s “very awful, 
terrible” at his brother’s game, 
and on top of that, he’s afraid of 
the ball.

He grew up playing hockey 

instead, 
starting 
the 
game 

when he was three years old. 
He says it was his first love, 
and though he decided to shift 
his focus to football once high 
school started, the skating 
skills have transferred over to 
the gridiron. 

“Hockey 
is 
all 
footwork 

there,” Bredeson said. “It’s not 
really the same style, but just 
being light on your feet and 
being able to change direction 
quick. Being able to read plays 
before it happens and read 
body language and then just 
reacting to it. It translates to the 
offensive line world pretty well 
— surprisingly well.”

Despite the move from high 

school to college, which included 
a move from left tackle to guard, 
Bredeson seems to have a handle 
on his role on the football team. 
Having his brother on campus 
definitely helps, but the support 
from his teammates has been 
incalculable. 

Fifth-year senior Ben Braden 

has taken Bredeson under his 
wing. Though they’re battling 
for the same job, Bredeson is not 
surprised at all about Braden’s 

willingness to help. 

“(Braden has helped) a lot 

more than you can imagine,” 
Bredeson said. “He and I roomed 
together all camp and we room 
together 
in 

the 
hotel 
for 

game 
nights. 

He’s 
helped 

me with plays,

to 
Michigan. 

That was before 
Bredeson 
even 

really 
knew 

Gary. Now, the 
two 
practice 

together 
all 

week.

“Rashan and I are great 

friends,” Bredeson said. “Just 
to watch him compete, it’s so 

much fun to watch. He has that 
intensity and that fire in him 
every single play, and you can 
see it. It’s real visible, and you 
can really appreciate it going 
against him.”

Though 
many 
Wolverines 

maintain that they’re preparing 
for Wisconsin the same way they 
prepared for earlier opponents 
this season, the game will be a 
little different for Bredeson. 

“I’m from the state and I grew 

up watching them all the time, 
but it’s just going to be a huge 
game for us,” Bredeson said. 
“It’s a big top-10 matchup and 
they’ve been coming out strong 
at the beginning of the year, and 
so have we, so it’s gonna be a 
heck of a game on Saturday.”

Robbery reported on N. Thayer St. Tuesday

On Tuesday at 12:30 a.m., 

two men entered and robbed 
an apartment on the 400 block 
of North Thayer Street, near 
the School of Nursing. Five 
residents, who are University 
of Michigan students, were 
present, according to a crime 
alert issued at 6:39 a.m. by the 
University of Michigan Division 
of Public Safety and Security.

According 
to 
a 
press 

release from the Ann Arbor 
Police Department, the men 

approached the house and asked 
if they could charge their cell 
phone. Once they were inside, 
one man pulled out a handgun 
and demanded credit cards, 
computers and cash. Though 
several items were stolen, no 
one was hurt and no shots were 
fired.

It is unknown in which 

direction the men fled from 
the house, and a K-9 track was 
unsuccessful.

The suspects were described 

as each being approximately 
6’0” to 6’5” and 200lbs.

Detectives 
are 
still 

interviewing victims and are 
hoping to get more information 
in the coming days. Detective 
Lieutenant Matthew Lige said 
as more information becomes 
available, AAPD will inform the 
campus community.

This is a developing story.

On Tuesday, Central Student 

Government 
released 
the 

second of two statements this 
week supporting Black students 
after racially charged posters 
were found on the University of 
Michigan’s campus Monday.

“If we are truly are the 

‘Leaders and Best,’ then we 
must work to ensure that every 
student feels welcomed, safe, 
and valued at Michigan,” the 
statement said. “Until we do so, 
we cannot honestly describe 
ourselves as such.”

The posters, found Monday 

in Mason and Haven Hall, 
listed 
“reasons 
why 
white 

women shouldn’t date black 
men” and “race differences 
in intelligence.” A third type 
called upon “Euro-Americans” 
to stop “denying your heritage” 
and “be white.” A group called 

the Alt-Right movement has 
claimed 
responsibility 
for 

creating and distributing the 
fliers. The Alt-Right is a white-
supremacist organization that 
has been labeled as a hate-group 
by the Southern Poverty Law 
Center. According to U.S. News, 
the group has targeted people 
of color, Jewish people and 
women.

More 
than 
200 
students 

gathered 
in 
the 
Fishbowl 

Monday 
night 
to 
protest, 

calling for more action from the 
administration. Some attendees, 
like LSA junior Lakyrra Magee, 
wished to see quicker turnover 
to the University President 
Mark Schlissel’s diversity plan, 
which aims to create a long-term 
strategy for increasing diversity 
on campus, with a benchmark of 
2025.

“It’s possible to do both,” 

Magee said, referring to the 
University addressing current 
events 
and 
the 
five-year 

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
plan. “But they’re not doing it. 
We want Schlissel to address us 
… about 2017, not 2025.”

Last Friday, CSG also released 

a statement in support of the 
#BlackLivesMatter 
movement 

in 
solidarity 
with 
Eastern 

Michigan University students 
after racist graffiti was found 
in EMU dorms and academic 
buildings.

Tuesday’s 
statement 

expressed a similar sentiment 
from the one on Friday, calling 
for solidarity.

“Let us start affirming that 

#BlackLivesMatter — today and 
everyday,” the statement said.

UM Medical School hosts 
ceremony for body donors

Students express appreciation in Rackham Auditoriam Tuesday night

In 
Rackham 
Auditorium 

Tuesday 
night, 
about 
300 

medical and dental students, as 
well as their family and friends, 
attended 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
Anatomical 

Donations Program’s annual 
memorial service for those 
who have donated their bodies 
to medical research.

The 
service 
included 

speeches from students about 
the importance of donors and 
the impact they have on student 
education, performances by the 
Auscultations Student Choir 
and a closed casket viewing in 
honor of the people who gave 
their bodies to science.

Dean Mueller, director of 

the 
anatomical 
donations 

program, said the students 
who worked with the donors 
took the initiative to show the 
importance of the donation.

“We are here to memorialize 

the donors that give their 
bodies to science,” Mueller 
said. “It’s really more of a thank 
you service from the students 
to the donors, and it is just a 
great way to ground everybody 
and bring them back home and 
help everybody remember why 
we’re doing what we’re doing 
and how important it is.”

The 
Revised 
Michigan 

Anatomical Gift Law, which 
was amended in 2008, allows 
residents 
to 
donate 
their 

bodies “for the purpose of 
transplantation, 
therapy, 

research, or education … ” 
This decision can be made by 
authorizing a donor symbol 
to 
be 
imprinted 
on 
one’s 

driver’s 
license, 
writing 
a 

donor statement in wills or 
making the decision while 

terminally ill. Once registered, 
the 
Anatomical 
Donations 

Program facilitates the usage 
of the donor at the University 
of Michigan.

First-year Dental student 

Peter Arvanitis spoke about 
the 
benefits 
of 
having 

physical 
subjects 
to 
learn 

from, 
describing 
them 
as 

crucial to long-term practical 
knowledge.

“As great as our anatomy 

faculty is here at Michigan, 
there are certain things that 
can’t be conveyed only through 
diagrams 
and 
lectures,” 

Arvanitis said. “As some of the 
other students here can attest, 
the things that can be taught 
through diagrams and lectures 
are 
sometimes 
forgotten 

shortly after the next test. But 
learning with our donors was 
tangible, it was vivid and that 
solidified the concepts in my 
mind.”

First-year Medical student 

Marwa 
Ayyash 
said 
she 

considers the act of donating 
one’s body to education to be 
extremely charitable and kind.

“It’s 
really 
honorable 

because as students it really 
helps us a lot and for the 
families; I think it’s a noble 
cause,” she said. “It allows 
the families and the person 
who donated their body for 
this to help shape our lives as 
doctors.”

In a speech written as a 

letter to her donor, second-
year Medical student Kathryn 
Brown said a deep connection 
forms between the student and 
the donor.

“To our donor, today we 

learned about the anatomy of 
the legs,” Brown said. “Those 
words might sound simple or 
boring maybe, but I want to 
thank you because with your 

help, it was amazing. These 
hands, did they once cradle 
new life? Your well-worn feet, 
to what corners of the world 
did they walk? … You can’t 
tell us, but just know that we 
wonder and appreciate that the 
answers are important.”

A common theme among 

student responses was the 
importance of giving thanks 
to both the donors and their 
families and friends. First-year 
Dental student Andrew Brown 
said without donors, he and his 
classmates’ formal education 
would not be possible.

“I think I speak for our class 

when I say, as we continue 
on these journeys, we will be 
forever grateful for the gifts 
that you have given to us, to 
this school and to the future of 
our health care,” Brown said.

Attendees Crystal Childs 

and Sam Cross from East 
Leroy, Mich., and Charlotte, 
Mich., 
respectively, 
said 

they were grateful for the 
hospitality and the memorial 
service for their loved ones. 
Cross was supportive of the 
donation process and said she 
hopes that the University’s 
students will use the education 
they gain from donations to 
cure illnesses tomorrow.

“I can see the great benefit of 

it, that it does help in research 
of diseases and what goes on in 
the human body,” Cross said.

Childs, 
who 
lost 
her 

stepfather 
to 
Lewy 
Body 

Dementia last September, said 
she agreed with Arvanitis.

“I think it’s great,” Childs 

said. “Hearing the students 
speak about how much it 
means to them spoke to me. A 
book is a book and a lecture is 
a lecture but to really solidify 
education you have to touch 
and see.”

Clinton unfavorably and 63 
percent say the same for Trump.

While 
he 
acknowledged 

the unpopularity of the two 
candidates, 
McPherson 
said 

he believes the TV media is 
pushing a false equivalency on 
the ratings between the two 
candidates that shouldn’t exist.

“Our goal is to correct the 

perception 
of 
Trump. 
We 

don’t think he is qualified at 
all, especially compared to 
Clinton,” McPherson said. “I 
imagine him being in the most 
powerful position ever and 
there is no way that it could end 
well.”

The 
group 
hopes 
to 

eventually plan a rally in the 
University’s diag to speak out 
against Trump. As of now, they 
are bringing in activists and 
volunteers to interact with club 
members.

“We want to funnel people 

who aren’t involved to join what 
is more of an activist group,” 
McPherson said. “We have 
more of a Democratic tilt, but 
we do have some Libertarians 
that feel like they have to vote 
for Clinton.”

While ultimately McPherson 

said he thinks Clinton is the 
better candidate, he added that 
the group aims to spark critical 
conversation 
rather 
than 

promote Clinton’s candidacy.

“Even if you vastly disagree 

with Clinton, you can’t say that 
Trump would be the better 
option,” 
McPherson 
said. 

“What we do is more about 
visibility, getting people to talk 
with friends and family about 
the election.”

The group’s anti-Trump view 

was also held by the majority of 
a sample of students in a poll 
conducted by The Michigan 
Daily. Almost 75 percent of 
repondents said they planned 
to vote for Clinton.

Public Policy junior Molly 

Aronson, a club member, said 
besides 
disagreeing 
with 

Trump’s conservative policies, 
she believes that the GOP 
candidate is a dangerous choice 
for the country.

“People are talking about 

the election in the sense that 
Clinton is the lesser of two 
evils,” Aronson said. “I see it 
in the opposite sense because 
if 
Trump 
were 
elected 
it 

could create a dangerous 
environment for a lot of people.” 

Similar to Aronson, LSA 

sophomore Lauren Schandevel 
said she believes voting in this 
election is more than just a 
question of whose policies you 
prefer. Schandevel, who helped 
to create the club at its onset but 
is no longer a member said she 
finds Trump’s inflammatory 
rhetoric alarming.

“It mobilizes sections of 

the 
population 
that 
have 

been dormant for awhile but 
now they feel like someone is 
speaking for them,” Schandevel 
said. “(It’s) creating this kind 
of atmosphere where people 
feel like it’s acceptable to hate 
and to be open about it. I think 
that’s a really dangerous thing.”

Schandevel also noted that a 

large emphasis in this election 
is the lasting legacy the next 
president will have choosing 
a replacement for deceased 
Supreme Court Justice Antonin 
Scalia.

“This is going to be someone 

who is either going to preserve 
progressive policies that have 
done a lot of good ... that’s 
decades of lingering effects of 
this presidency,” Schandevel 
said.

However, it is also this 

lingering effect of a SCOTUS 
justice that is the primary 
influence 
on 
Engineering 

sophomore Jack Kuchta in his 
decision to vote for Trump. 
Kuchta said that his foundation 
is built on conservative values, 
citing his Catholic upbringing.

“For me, a big reason that I 

would vote for Trump is to pick 
a conservative, pro-life justice 
to replace Antonin Scalia who 
definitely held my conservative, 
pro-life values,” Kuchta said.

Kuchta added that, as a 

conservative on a primarily 
liberal campus, he has felt 
threatened by people attacking 
him for what they assume are 
his views, based on depictions 
of Trump supporters in the 
media.

Referencing Clinton calling 

half of Trump supporters a 
“basket of deplorables,” Kuchta 
said Clinton and the media are 
painting Trump supporters in 
a negative light, leaving people 
assuming 
that 
all 
Trump 

supporters 
as 
racists 
and 

homophobic.

“We don’t want Trump solely 

for him ... I know people who are 
voting for Trump solely because 
they 
want 
a 
conservative 

justice,” Kuchta said. “For me, 
if 
someone 
loves 
someone, 

cool, that doesn’t affect me. 
If they want to get married, 
that’s totally fine by me. A lot 
of people think conservatives 
are complete homophobes. It’s 
a very bad representation of 
conservatives.”

When 
asked 
about 

the 
creation 
of 
this 
club, 

the 
University’s 
College 

Republicans, 
who 
endorsed 

Trump, wrote in a statement, 
“The creation of this club 
doesn’t come to much of a 
surprise 
given 
the 
liberal 

bias of this university. Aside 
from supporting Mr. Trump’s 
presidential campaign, College 
Republicans 
will 
also 
be 

working with the campaigns of 
Congressman Dave Trott and 
Congressman Mike Bishop. We 
encourage all conservatives to 
uphold our values by supporting 
our local and congressional 
Republican candidates.”

College Democrats declined 

to comment on the existence of 
Students Against Trump.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | SEPTEMBER 28, 2016


I can already hear my sister’s 

response to this column: “WE GET 
IT SYLVANNA, YOU’RE GRADU-
ATING EARLY.”

My younger sister, Phoebe, is 

probably happy I started off with a 
blatant acceptance of how humble-
brag this space can get. So there you 
go, Phoebe. This is my public accep-
tance that I, Sylvanna Leah Gross, 
am kind of an asshole.

Moving forward.
This space is meant to be a com-

ment on how every senior is in this 
weird limbo of almost having to 
be an adult with taxes and mort-
gages while still forgetting that you 
should be taking vitamins every 
day, not just when you remember 
you should be taking them. It’s 
dedicated to seniors who feel like 
they’re occupying a liminal space 
where they can’t be considered 
full-blown adults yet, but are being 
forced to make very adult decisions. 
It’s for people like me, who are 
scared to move forward.

Being scared isn’t a bad thing. 

It’s a natural response to going into 
the unknown. It’s what you should 
be when something happens that 
you’re not familiar with. From my 
basic understanding of the sciences, 
it’s a biological response. So why are 
seniors so scared of being scared?

For me, it’s the fact that for the 

first time there is no absolute for-
mula for what we have to do. Grow-
ing up, I knew the formula that my 
teachers pounded into my head: 
high school, college, job. But it was 
relatively easy to make the jump 

from high school to college. One 
quick application, a couple of rejec-
tions and a couple of acceptances 
and one decision to the best public 
university in the world.

But now, the jump isn’t as clear-

cut. I could get a job. Or I could get 
a master’s degree or go into a doc-
torate program or earn a fellowship 
or go into an internship or take time 
off and travel (this last option is 
not supported by my bank account, 
unfortunately).

I’m the type of person who always 

had a plan. But for the first time in 
my life, I have no clue what my next 
step will be. I know I want to go 
to law school, but I also know I’m 
not ready yet for that step. Because 
once I go, I have to get a job. And 
once I get a job, that’s my life.

I completely understand that I 

am making this process feel way too 
black and white. Of course there are 
alternative ways of living your life, 
and there are many reasons why I 
am being insensitive to how I had 
the privilege of going to college and 
so am not in the place to complain. 
But, I am complaining. Because I’m 
scared and I know a lot of you are too.

So here’s some tips on relaxing 

and being less scared for at least 10 
minutes.

1. You are not alone
2. It will feel like you are alone 

but let me repeat, YOU ARE NOT 
ALONE

3. But maybe, find yourself a 

quiet place and be alone physically

4. Put on your relaxing music 

(U2 or some Jason Mraz puts me in 

a good mood)

5. Drink a glass of water
6. Lay in your bed
7. Put your phone down and 

turn on “Do not disturb”

8. Just listen (it is very possible 

you might mistake this as a nap, it is 
very important you do not mistake 
this as a nap)

9. Think about your mom, or 

dad, or siblings, or significant other 
or any person who stands beside 
you no matter what

10. If you want to pass on step 8 

for whatever personal matter, think 
about cute cuddly puppies or think 
of the funniest memory you have

11. Remember, you are not alone.

“I’ve been thinking about Andy Warhol’s idea of 

repetition in his work. His idea is that with the 

repetition of an image, that image is then deflated 

of meaning. I disagree with Warhol’s notion as 

of late because the more I see the presidential 

candidates ,the less numb I feel about them. 

Watching the debate was disturbing on many 

levels. What was even more disturbing was seeing 

everyone laugh about it. People can laugh all they 

want, but one of those two people will be leading 

our country very soon.”

oming into college, it’s safe 
to assume you’ll have a group 
assignment or two. They can go 

in many directions: some nice, others 
painful. In my experience, everyone just 
wants to get the work done as quickly 
as possible — with as few conflicts as 
possible. More motivated members 
pick up the slack for the less motivated 
ones, and so the vicious cycle of disdain 
toward group projects begins. Last year 
when an assignment in one of my class-
es called for pair work, we would switch 
partners throughout the semester to get 
to know all the people in the class. The 
assignments were short and I’d meet 
with my partner for an hour or so to get 
the job done, refraining from talk of our 
personal lives, where we were from or 
even what brought us to the University 
of Michigan. 

During the second rotation, my part-

ner took the time to ask me how my day 
was, which was weird. I was used to get-
ting straight to business, not dabbling 
in something as wishy-washy as the 
quality of my day. Why would we waste 
time on this? It wasn’t going to change 
anything and would only detract from 
the time we had to complete the assign-
ment. But as we asked each other ques-
tions, delving into one another’s lives, 
the conversation became more natural 
and enjoyable. Suddenly, 30 minutes 
had gone by and I’d made a connection 
with someone who is still my friend 
today. In taking the time to learn about 
this person’s life, I found that he was 
an international student here and had 
lived in many different countries before 
coming to the University of Michigan. I 
remember thinking how cool that was, 

that someone would choose to come all 
the way to Michigan out of all the uni-
versities in the world to choose from.

Fast forward to winter semester of 

last year. As part of my involvement in 
the Center for Positive Organizations — 
a research center in the Ross School of 
Business — I was taking a class called 
The Foundations of Positive Organiza-
tional Scholarship. We examined the 
research behind positive leadership and 
positive business, learning that every-
one you interact with has a story that is 
unique to them. According toresearch, 

there’s strong evidence to support that 
connecting with people can elevate your 
mood, build resilience, increase creativ-
ity and even improve your health. That’s 
amazing to me. By talking to others, and 
listening to their stories, we can feel 
better about ourselves in multiple ways.

The business program at the Uni-

versity is extremely group-oriented. 
I have group projects for almost all of 
my classes, and I’m constantly meeting 
different people; however, oftentimes 
we aren’t really talking to one another. 
When I met with my partner for The 

Foundations of Positive Organizational 
Scholarship, I at first didn’t take the 
time to learn about who he was, what 
his purpose was in the Business School 
or what made him tick. I cared about 
what he brought to the table and how 
he would help me get the A I so badly 
wanted.

Taking a step back, I realize how 

much healthier and productive we are 
when we get to know one another and 
indulge in each other’s stories. After 
learning about positive organizational 
research, my eyes were opened to this 
unique background people are con-
stantly carrying around on their shoul-
ders. I thought about the myriad types 
of students we have here on campus 
and how they have such different life 
experiences than mine. We have in-
staters, out-of-staters, first-generation 
students, fourth-generation students, 
transfer students, graduate students 
and people from all over the world here 
in one place, with so many different sto-
ries and purposes.

With recruitment for summer intern-

ships in full swing, classes, homework 
and extracurriculars, I know I’m not 
alone in forgetting about self-care. 
However, it only takes a few minutes 
to chat with someone in the Starbucks 
line, or reach out to an old friend you 
haven’t spoken with, or even call your 
grandmother to say hello. After learn-
ing about the type of impact these con-
nections with others can have on the 
mind and body, there’s no reason not to 
take a chance and learn something new 
about someone each day.

ric Fretz showed up early, wearing a smile 
and a tan baseball cap. He emailed me upon 
his arrival — stating where exactly he was 

sitting — and he made sure to be accommodating, 
suggesting we move away from the noise of the 
coffee shop to ensure a clearer recording.

He must have picked up my nervous, slightly 

unsure demeanor, as he began to answer each 
of my questions before I had the chance to ask 
them. Fretz talked for nearly 45 minutes without 
interruption.

A faculty adviser — and previous member — 

of the University of Michigan Student Veteran 
Association, Fretz was one of many veterans 
on campus who shared with me their stories 
transitioning from military life to academia.

From conversations with several, a common 

thread emerged — that at the University don’t 
know there is a large community of veterans 
on campus, made up of students and faculty 
much like Fretz, who have faced unpredictable 
challenges 
and 
welcomed 
numerous 

opportunities associated with military life.

These students and faculty have had a variety 

of unique experiences during their time in 
the military, including deployment, learning 
a new set of social rules, acquiring a different 
language and experiencing a stronger sense of 
camaraderie than a student organization on 
campus can typically provide.

Similarly, some of the veterans said people are 

also unaware of the lack of external awareness 
and naïveté these veterans often encounter when 
re-entering civilian life.

Yet if asked, these men and women will gladly 

share their stories, and they will arrive to the 
interview prepared and timely (in fact, with time 
to spare) — just like their military service taught 
them to.

Fretz first arrived on campus in 1985 on a Navy 

ROTC scholarship. After graduating four years 
later, he went into active duty for the Navy for 20 
years. Upon returning to the University in 1998 
to pursue a dual Ph.D. in the Combined Program 
in Education and Psychology, Fretz faced a lot 
of adversity. From being mobilized twice, to 
having two children, to managing other family 
circumstances, it took him 12 years to complete 
the program.

“I just wanted to serve,” Fretz said of his 

military aspirations.

Challenges

Fretz said there are many struggles veterans 

have when adjusting to civilian student life.

“There’s a fascinating sort of cohesion and 

unity of purpose that is common to almost all 
(veterans),” he explained. “There’s this element 
in the military of trust and common purpose 
that’s very hard to replicate and find in the 
civilian world, and one of the things that vets 
report consistently that puts them most ill at 
ease, that gets them the most off-balance, is this 
lack of comradeship.”

Because of this, Fretz has a particular way 

of depicting the contradictory feelings veterans 
sometimes have in his student veteran transition 
course.

“There’s that picture of this fully grown Adam 

Sandler in a tiny desk surrounded by tiny desks 
with tiny kids, and that one picture gets such a 
visceral response from the vets, because that’s 
how they feel,” Fretz said.

“They are so acutely aware that they are 

older and they have had these experiences and 
they have sort of changed their world view, 
and they behave differently, they understand 
accountability differently, they manage their 
time differently, their life priorities,” he added. 
“That extreme edge of youth has been forcibly 
scraped off them and they just feel that very 
acutely.”

Timothy Nellett, another veteran and program 

coordinator for UM’s Peer Advisors for Veteran 
Education, said he enlisted in the U.S. Marine 
Corps in 2005. After four years in service, Nellett 
started going to college, first attending two 
different community colleges before transferring 
to the University. Nellett feels the best way to 
describe the student veteran community is by 
calling them the “non-traditional of the non-
traditional.”

Philip Larson, a veteran of the U.S. Air Force 

and the U.S. Air Force Reserve, is now director 
of the UM Student Veterans Assistance Program. 
He said student veterans oftentimes face 
situations where their peers seem immature, in 
the sense that they are lacking in life experience.

“To a person who has just been launching 

aircraft carriers off the deck of the JFK, or a 
person who has been trying not to get blown 
up by an IED, this is an extremely foreign 
environment,” Larson said, emphasizing the 
differences between student veterans and more 
“traditional” college students who are focused 
on Greek life or joining student organizations. 
“They feel very outside and alone.”

Business senior Jonathan Chen, current 

president of the Student Veterans Association 
on campus and former sergeant in the Marine 
Corps, agreed with those sentiments.

“Part of you wants to let it go,” Chen said. “But 

then another part of you is like, this is a huge 
part of my life, I have something to contribute. 
Sometimes it’s fighting between those two … 
At first it’s just like any other social identity, 
you’re trying to figure out your place within the 
University, you’re trying to figure out your place 
within society.”

Campus climate

Fretz also noted another significant issue: 

a liberal-leaning political climate generally 
associated with the University.

“It tends to be left-of-center and not 

particularly pro-military,” Fretz said. “They just 
feel like they’re not particularly understood, 
sometimes they feel like they’re treated with 
contempt … A lot of times they do feel excluded. 
It’s interesting, they’re not monolithically 
conservative, 
but 
they 
are 
monolithically 

respectful of their time in the military.”

One recent example of the conflicting military 

rhetoric on campus was the incident regarding 
the showing of “American Sniper” in April 2015. 
Students raised concern about the film’s anti-
Islam images, while others, including veterans, 
said they felt students’ negative responses to the 
film were indicative of a lack of appreciation for 
their military service.

This has led to divergent responses about 

whether vets decide to be vocal about their 
military career on campus. Fretz referred to this 
as “coming out” as a vet — some student veterans 
remain “closeted”, while others are open about 
their experiences and find either that people do 
not quite know how to react to them, or react to 
them negatively.

Cassie Michaels, now a University graduate, 

was enlisted in the Marine Corps prior to coming 
to the University. Michaels completed one 
semester of college at UM-Flint before enlisting, 
and one additional there while applying 
to transfer to the Ann Arbor campus after 
serving. Michaels was in her early 20s entering 
sophomore year, making her a few years older 
than her peers.

She echoed many of the sentiments of other 

veterans, such as feeling unaccustomed to 
campus life. In particular, she recounted a story 
about a class that had an iClicker question in 
lecture, and though the traditional freshmen 
and sophomores in the class had an iClicker with 
them, she didn’t have one and did not know what 
they were. She also failed her first assignment at 
the University, something that was also novel to 
her. Both instances, she said, led to her feeling 
behind and made her feel she did not align to the 
campus climate.

As part of an even smaller demographic on 

campus — female veteran students — Michaels 
said she felt challenged and alone. Though she 
started going to SVA meetings upon arriving to 
campus, she found she was the only female there.

“We may have had the same experiences while 

in the military, but they still wouldn’t be the 
same because they would be male and I would be 
female,” Michaels said. “I just didn’t feel like my 
experiences would be valid.”

Dentistry junior Alyssa Carrillo, who was a 

dental lab technician in the Air Force for four 
years before beginning college in fall 2013, said 
her troubles identifying with fellow veterans 
also stemmed from there being so few females 
who were in the military on campus. Her own 
experiences now contribute to much of her work 
as a peer adviser in the Office of New Student 
Programs, where she often reaches out to other 
female veterans.

“We’re all just student vets trying to figure 

out how to integrate ourselves into the culture,” 
Carrillo said. “I always get all the time ‘you’re a 
vet? You look like you’re 18 and you’re a woman’ 
— it’s just the stereotypes. But I kind of like that. 
I think it’s cool to not be a stereotype.”

Cultural transition
Along with these challenged, veterans said the 

transition veterans have to make from military 
life to academia is also a significant change. 
Fretz, for example, transitioned between life as 
an ROTC student, receiving another bachelor’s 
degree while serving time in active duty and 
getting a Master’s during his time as a reservist.

“I had to jump back and forth between the 

academic world and the military world, and 
those changes are very dramatic,” Fretz said. 
“Everybody has their reasons for raising their 
hand, but once you raise your hand and swear 
that oath, it’s like you’re not in Kansas anymore 
… You realize these huge shifts in how systems 
work, and these different worlds.”

Fretz said he experienced a cultural mismatch 

on a number of occasions. For example, 
in graduate school, per requests from his 
professors, he was doing multiple projects at 
once, often while sacrificing his school work. He 
said he had a military mindset that his professors 
were similar to his senior officers, and that they 
must have had good, important reasoning behind 
giving him so much work.

He added that he has found it interesting 

interacting with veterans who are similar to 
how he was, from a faculty member perspective 
now saying he understands his students’ natural 
tendency to exhibit respect toward authority 
figures. However, he tells them that in a 
university setting, it is preferred they interact 
with their professors in a way that is usually 
much different from their senior officers.

Graduate student Aaron Silver, president 

of the Ross School of Business Armed Forces 
Association, said he came to the University to 
pursue a master’s degree in business following 
five years as an active-duty artillery officer. 
During his time in the military, Silver was 
primarily stationed in Germany but also had two 
deployments overseas.

“I think all of those that go through the 

transition experience a little bit of what I 
call a culture whiplash,” Silver said. “The 
military is a lifestyle and to some degree, you’re 
indoctrinated. It’s a culture with certain norms 
and mores and expectations and shared beliefs 
and shared values, and when you leave that 
culture, life is different.”

Silver, however, made sure to highlight that, 

“while it can be a little jarring to go from military 
time to Michigan time, (veterans) pay it forward 
with our shared experiences.”

Mental health misconceptions

The 
veterans 
interviewed 
also 
talked 

extensively about misconceptions attached to 
veteran stability.

“It’s all too common for someone to say, ‘You 

were a vet? Did you get deployed? Did you kill 
anyone?’ ” Fretz said. “This idea that every vet is 
kind of a ticking time bomb, or when you survey 
employers ‘What’s your biggest concern hiring 
vets?’ and everybody just thinks that all vets 
have PTSD, and it’s really not true.”

Larson echoed Fretz’s sentiments and said 

veteran students come back from combat to 
a — albeit unintentional — naïveté about their 
experiences on campus.

“Two months ago, or a year ago, they were 

in charge of multi-million-dollar aircraft, they 
were in charge of keeping other people safe, 
they were in charge of other people’s well-
being as an enlisted NCO,” Larson said. “And 
they come to this campus and nobody gets it — 
nobody gets it.”

Nellett recounted a situation where a student 

once found out how old he was — older than 
most of the other students in the class — and 
asked him what he had been doing with his life, 
inappropriately insinuating that, because he 
was older, he must have been taking time off or 
not taking school seriously. When the student 
discovered Nellett was in the military, she 
simply responded, “Please don’t kill me.”

“There are some people out there that are 

like that and create more of a divide than there 
needs to be, and it mostly stems from a place of 
ignorance,” Nellett said. “I really don’t think 
that most of the time it’s coming from a place of 
malicious intent — it’s really a lack of awareness 
or understanding.”

While on campus, Michaels said she had 

feelings of anxiety in crowded lecture halls, 
nightmares and struggled in high-pressure 
situations — all of which she said are symptoms 
of her Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

“I may jump and flinch whenever I hear 

a loud noise, or I may feel panicked when I’m 

in an enclosed area with a lot of people, but 
you just have to trust me that I’ve got this,” 
Michaels said. “When people think of veterans, 
they automatically think of this broken person 
who can’t function in society, and I think that in 
order to change that, the veterans that are doing 
well and becoming these really successful, 
functional citizens, they need to identify 
themselves as veterans … And the reason why 
they don’t is because of the stigma.”

Because people experience things differently, 

veterans stressed that traditional students 
should not generalize student veterans in 
the same way student veterans should not 
generalize the student population as ignorant of 
the military experience.

“Like any other social identity, we come with 

our stereotypes, we come with the stigmas that 
are attached to it,” Chen said.

Larson added that veterans tend to have their 

own culture that would be beneficial to campus 
diversity — something Fretz echoed — that could 
improve other students’ misunderstandings.

“From the veteran’s perspective, they find it 

puzzling and frustrating that the mental health 
thing is always made salient,” Fretz said. “You 
never know what journey people are on, and so 
you shouldn’t discount them — everybody has 
something to teach here.”

Resources

Among the challenges, many resources 

are also available at the University, including 
several led by veterans.

The Student Veterans Assistance Program, 

run out of the Office of New Student Programs, 
has goals similar to those of student veteran 
organizations on campus in ensuring veteran 
students have the resources necessary to be 
successful in their academic, professional and 
social careers at the University and beyond.

Larson, 
the 
director 
of 
the 
Students 

Veterans Assistance Program, said he works 
on a number of efforts to organize University 
veteran services, such as assisting with 
college applications, collaborating with VA 
representatives in the Office of the Registrar 
and coordinating with certifying officials to 
ensure students get the appropriate veteran 
benefits. Additionally, he works with the Office 
of Financial Aid, University Housing, graduate 
student organizations and individual college 
advising within the University, as well as 
coodinates peer mentor activities.

“Along with the academic stress, they may 

have other life stressors, and so if we can help 
out with the life stress part, the academic stress 
becomes a lot more manageable,” Larson said.

In his work, Larson said he is able to reduce 

misconceptions students have about what 
the military does, honor veterans’ sacrifice 
and service and help them use their military-
instilled skills in conjunction with a UM 
education, all in an attempt to improve the 
military-to-academia culture shock that he had 
seen in previous years.

“Students came out of the military with … 

different kind of language, different kind of 
skillsets, different kind of expectations,” Larson 
said. “And when they got to campus, they found 
themselves in a different cultural environment 
than what they were used to.”

HOW STUDENT 

ADAPT TO 

CAMPUS LIFE

VETERANS 


I 

am sitting on the bottom stair in February of 2016, 
glancing at the nearby door to my house, waiting to 
hear the knock. This is not only my first Tinder date, 

but my first date in my life.

I hear a faint stirring, then steps, and I know she is here. 

It’s midnight, because that’s the only time we could meet 
up. We have messaged back and forth for a couple days, 
first on Tinder, then on Facebook Messenger. Our con-
versations flow naturally, at least online. We have a lot in 
common — she’s into the same indie shit that I am. She 
has the aggressive sarcasm that I am attracted to, and the 
aggressive forwardness that I feel I need, especially for a 
potential first girlfriend.

I take a deep breath, heart hammering, and open the 

door. We go up to my room, sit on the bed, and talk.

At first she is surprisingly shy compared to the bluntness 

of her messages, but we quickly become more comfortable 
together and she begins to resemble the girl that I already 
feel like I know. Somehow, her rambling, punctuation-less 
text speak is reflected in her quirky way of speaking, with 
her loose form of sentence structure. Her sarcasm and 
irony are immediately present, though in pleasantly lower 
doses than online — you can easily obscure your feelings 
with text, hiding your smiles and your laughs and your 
shock, but now I see her laugh freely and I feel relieved 
that the irony only goes so far.

She tells me random anecdotes from her past, most very 

funny but with weird, dark undercurrents that somehow 
make them funnier. I tell her boring things about myself, 
such as how I won the spelling bee in eighth grade or what 
classes I’m taking. At one point, she says that I’m sharing a 
lot, but not sharing my “soul” like she is. I know what she 
means, but I’m not sure what to do differently. No deeply 
revealing stories have immediately leaped to mind.

She is very forward, just like online, saying something 

lame and then asking, “Did you like that pick-up line?,” 
even making startlingly early jokes about what our chil-
dren will be like. She scoots closer to me and touches my 
knee and rubs my arm and nestles her head in the crook of 
my neck and gives me a back massage and then stares down 
at me from above, unable to stop laughing, as she sits on 
my stomach and my legs prop up her back. We sit together 
in silence or lie together whispering or laugh uncontrol-
lably for reasons we can’t remember, and I think about 
how unusually intimate this is and how this is something 
I’ve never experienced before, at least in this context. This 
came from Tinder?

In addition to this dreamlike intimacy, I have two 

dominant emotions: 1. Incredulity that someone actually 
dressed up and put on makeup and tried to look good for 
me, and 2. thankfulness that this girl is forward enough to 
freely admit her intentions and her feelings, because I am 
absolutely terrible at discerning someone’s feelings for me. 
This is what I’ve always perceived as the main reason I’ve 
never had a girlfriend.

And then she asks, “Are you maybe ever going to kiss 

me?” And it’s not in the blunt, funny, here-goes-nothing 
“kiss me you dummy!” way; it’s in the nervous, unsure, 
confused way. She is confused because in all the moments 
where we stared each other in the eyes or laughed inches 
away from each other, I did not kiss her. And I do not know 
why.

Minutes pass, and I am trying to think of some way to 

kiss her, but I feel paralyzed. I have kissed two girls before 
in my life. The first kissed me in high school because I had 
made my feelings clear and the ball was in her court. The 

second kissed me outside a frat house bathroom because I 
hadn’t been actively pursuing her but I guess she wanted 
to. And now there is this girl and I have never considered 
myself a shitty kisser and this girl is throwing herself at 
me and making it clear what she wants and I fucking can’t.

I am frozen for minutes and she probably feels my heart-

beat, hard and fast. Then I blurt out, “Can I ask you to do 
something weird?”

“Um,” she says, and I quickly say, “I mean, not really 

weird. Not super weird or anything. Just kind of weird.”

“OK, try me,” she says.
“Can you … kiss me?” I ask.
Well, there’s my soul.
She takes a deep breath and I tell her I know it’s stu-

pid or weird and I’m sorry and I don’t know why, and she 
scowls and says “no,” like I’m wrong to feel weird about it. 
I hope I am, but I’m not sure.

She kisses me. We kiss. I think it’s fine but I really don’t 

know because a few minutes after it’s over, she leaves. OK, 
it’s 5:00 in the morning, so that’s fine, but it still feels a 
little abrupt. And when she gets home she messages me 
“sweet dreams,” so it wasn’t weird enough for her to ice me 
out completely. But a few days pass and we don’t talk much 
and I ask if she wants to hang out again and she agrees but 
it just doesn’t happen. And every time I think about any 
embarrassing aspect of that night — the question I asked 
her, the kiss itself, the moments afterward with her staring 
at the ceiling, the way she stepped out the door without 
really smiling as she said goodbye — I feel fucking humili-
ated and I shut my eyes and press my palms into my eyelids 
so hard I see color.

I am not sure what happened. Maybe I am a truly awful 

kisser or I did something weird while it was happening. 
Maybe my self-consciousness was a massive turn-off. I’m 
not sure what in particular screwed things up, because 
everything was going so well before, and even if things did 
get a little weird, was that really enough to undo the emo-
tional intimacy we achieved before? Or maybe that wasn’t 
real emotional intimacy; maybe it was just one touchy girl 
and a lot more physical attention than I was ever used to.

But what I do know is that my persona as a writer is 

inextricably linked to every other aspect of my personality 
and life, including dating. Every person I meet, I wonder 
what exactly they think about me, not just general feel-
ings of like/dislike but extremely specific details. I strive 

to remember and write down everything that happens to 
me. I wonder about old friends, I speculate about future 
friends, sometimes I think about every single person I 
know and wonder what everyone is individually doing at 
this very moment and what they did yesterday and years 
ago and what they’ll do years from now and I become over-
whelmed and want to pass out so my head isn’t filled with 
so many unanswerable questions.

In sitcoms, the characters go on dates with new people 

every episode, and every new guest star is a caricature — 
“the one who’s obsessed with model trains” or “the one 
who’s attractive but dumb.” At the end of each episode, the 
guest star leaves and Monica Geller or Jessica Day or Ted 
Mosby moves on. But I can’t move on like that.

This is part of why I don’t date regularly. As much as I 

might yearn to flirt at parties and sleep around, I am not 
someone who can, because I am seriously self-conscious, 
and I don’t have the ability to forget anyone or flatten them 
into a two-dimensional guest star in my life. As a writer 
who strives to be a good person, my stubborn penchant for 
imagining the vast complexity of everyone’s lives is help-
ful. But as a 20-year-old who sometimes wants almost des-
perately to be in a loving long-term relationship, it’s shitty. 
It’s very frequently my absolute favorite quality about 
myself, but in times like these, it’s my least favorite.

So there I was sitting with a girl who really liked me and 

I couldn’t make a move because I was obsessively worrying 
about what would happen and what she would think and 
what could go wrong and what she could tell her friends 
about me. I was paralyzed everywhere, wanting and feel-
ing but physically unable to do what I needed to do.

What I try to remind myself now is that this is still a 

transitional period. As I meet new people and date more, 
I’ll learn to get out of my own head. I will learn to care more 
about what I want than what other people want, to be self-
ish but in a healthy way. I’ll learn to forget the people who 
deserve to be forgotten for their ultimate insignificance to 
my life. And one day, I will be in a relationship that doesn’t 
require so much constant scrutiny and self-consciousness.

But on the worst days, I am worried that it will never 

happen, and that it will be because of me. It will be because 
of my insistence on thinking of people as individuals with 
a dizzying, incomprehensible array of hopes, dreams, fears 
and particular reasons they feel the way they do about me.

Scared of Romance

Wednesday, September 28, 2016 // The Statement 
7B

by Lydia Murray, Daily Staff Reporter
I’ve Moved Around a Lot 

A

s someone who dreads the inevitable question of 
“Where are you from?” I’ve learned a crafty answer 
to the complicated question. For people I will 

never see again, I’ll say I’m from Michigan, citing a city 
I lived in for at least a year or two. Sometimes, if I’m feel-
ing bold, I’ll lie and make up a hometown, usually a place 
I’ve at least visited — Baltimore, Connecticut or Auckland. 
During classroom introductions, my M.O. is omitting the 
hometown part of the line of questioning and hoping no 
one notices.

But for those who I will see on a regular basis, I have to 

at least try to tell the truth: I don’t have a hometown. “It’s 
complicated” I often start, followed by “I moved around a 
lot” or “I was born in Michigan, but I lived overseas for a 
lot of my life.”

This, of course, always leads to follow up questions of 

where and when, but then most people forget without 
truly understanding.

Growing up around the globe was the most incredible, 

rewarding experience I could have asked for. In my life-
time, I have lived in three countries and nine houses. I’ve 
traveled to more countries than the number of years I’ve 
been on this earth by a margin of almost 10. I’ve spent 
Thanksgiving watching the sunrise over the Angkor Wat 
temple in Cambodia; Christmas in Auckland, New Zea-
land, at a McDonald’s, waiting to catch a flight to Christ-
church; and New Year’s watching the fireworks off the 
banks of Venice.

But with all the glory and adventure associated with my 

third-culture kid life, there are hardships that have left 
scars on my personality. I’ve lost more best friends than 
most kids have in a lifetime. No one outside of my imme-
diate family can really claim they’ve known me my whole 
life. I don’t have a specific place to call home.

While most kids counted down the days to summer, I 

dreaded it, because a summer never passed when a friend 

— or myself — didn’t move away. I remember numerous 
days spent crying as yet another best friend moved away.

And this sentiment carried over into my life at college. 

Coming to the University of Michigan, I thought finally 
I would have an uninterrupted four years where no one 
would leave me, but this illusion was quickly shattered. At 
a school with a 97-percent retention rate, two of my friends 
made plans to transfer. With a class size of approximately 
6,000, this meant just 180 people would leave — and I was 
best friends with two of them.

During my last week of exams, I watched all of my 

friends go home for the summer as I prepared to remain in 
Ann Arbor, with my family still 7,000 miles away. I tried my 
best to keep myself together as I watched my best friends 
pack up their rooms, knowing they would not be returning. 
Somehow I managed to hide my despair as I waved good-
bye after they packed their final boxes, but as soon as their 
backs were turned, I ran up to my room to wallow. This 
wasn’t supposed to happen here. I was supposed to have 
four whole years.

A friend told me the other day that she thought I hated 

her when we first met because I was so quiet. I’m sorry to 
anyone if I seem that way. It’s hard sometimes to let myself 
make friends when I live with the constant expectation 
that they will just leave again soon.

And friendships are not the only difficult aspect. In 

part, I’ve come dislike most holidays since returning to 
the United States. You could argue that I’ve simply become 
spoiled from my glamourous travels, but my issue mostly 
stems from a lack of real tradition or sentiment attached to 
them — especially Thanksgiving.

Last year at Thanksgiving I discovered what it is like 

to be the only person living in South Quad. Fun fact: If no 
one else is using the showers, there is no warm water. That 
weekend I watched Netflix and called home at a predeter-
mined time, accounting for the 12-hour time difference to 

see my family enjoying the few days off with a vacation in 
Gui Lin, China. I would check Instagram and Facebook 
and see other people’s family photos and golden turkeys, 
while hiding under the covers in my empty dorm room.

With every passing holiday my first year in college, I was 

reminded of what normal kids do — Memorial Day barbe-
cues, giant Christmas parties with extended family, New 
Year’s bashes with hometown friends. These are all things 
I didn’t feel like I missed out on until suddenly I had no 
family and no adventure to supplement traditional activi-
ties.

But this year, Thanksgiving will be different. Instead 

of 20 hours via plane from me, my family is a 30-minute 
drive down the highway — with no traffic. I can go home 
not only for Christmas but for Mid-Autumn Festival and 
Thanksgiving or just to do laundry.

Nonetheless, this new home isn’t my hometown. I don’t 

have childhood memories playing in the backyard. I have 
no childhood friends waiting. Those memories and those 
people are scattered in India, China, Singapore, the United 
Kingdom and many others.

But just because I lack a hometown doesn’t mean I lack a 

home. Home may not be a city filled with a string of memo-
ries dating back to my first steps. It may not come with a 
collection of friends who have known me since kindergar-
ten. But home is where I walk in the door to be greeted by 
my energetic Border collie. Home is where I can eat rice 
and stir fry every day while laughing at the dinner table 
with my sisters. Home isn’t about the place, it’s about the 
people, the feeling and the atmosphere.

And this new home in Random Suburb No. 9 is only 

temporary. Already my family discussions center around 
the next step, the next place. Los Angeles, Rio, Stockholm, 
Tijuana. But no matter if home is thousands of miles away 
or just a few blocks down the road, I know it will always 
be there for me.

Camp Kesem is a non-profit organization that 
provides a free summer camp for kids affected 
by a parent’s cancer. I’ve never encountered 
a more positive, welcoming and loving 
environment, and I’m proud to spread the CK 
magic. At Camp Kesem, our hands get dirty a 
lot, and whether it’s from working with tie-dye 
or throwing paint, dirty hands mean everyone 
just did something fun. In this photo, campers 
hold hands during a game of human twister.

Black unit, the oldest campers, put their hands together 
after a tie-dye session at Arts and Crafts.
