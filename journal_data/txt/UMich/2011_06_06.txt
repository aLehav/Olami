U' trespass policy revisions
receive criticism from ACLU

IN MEMORY
Dr. Jack
Kevorkian
dies at 83
'U' Medical School
alum known for
physician-assisted
suicides passes away
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
ManagingNews Editor
Jack Kevorkian - a doctor
best known for his advocacy of
assisted suicide - died of a blood
clot on Friday at Beaumont Hospi-
tal in Royal Oak, Michigan at the
age of 83. Kevorkian was born and
raised in Michigan and graduated
from the University's Medical
School in 1952.
Members of the University
community who had formerly
worked with or met Kevorkian
said that while they may not have
agreed with his motives, they
respected his steadfast beliefs and
ability to challenge aspects of the
American health care system.
Kevorkian, who was com-
monly known as "Dr. Death," was
sentenced with 10-to-25 years in
prison in March 1999 after assist-
ing in the suicides of at least 130
terminally ill patients through-
out the 1990s. After Kevorkian's
release from prison in June 2007,
he promised to never perform
an assisted suicide again. How-
ever, he continued to advocate
for the option while living out the
remainder of his years in Bloom-
field Hills, Michigan.

historian at the University who
met Kevorkian on several occa-

Group claims
revised policy may
inhibit free speech
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
Though representatives from
the American Civil Liberties
Union said recent changes to the
University's trespass policy are an
improvement, they are concerned
that potential abuse by Depart-
ment of Public Safety officers and
a lack of an independent body to
oversee appeals may still impede

free speech rights.
The new trespass policy,
which goes into effect on July 1,
will limit the duration of a ban
to one year unless DPS feels an
extension is warranted, expand
bans to include all three Univer-
sity campuses and set up further
review and appeals processes to
the DPS Oversight Committee.
Michael Steinberg, legaldirec-
tor of the Michigan chapter of the
ACLU, said that while the new
policy remedies previous inad-
equacies of the former policy, the
ACLU has major concerns about
allowing the DPS chief of police to
hear appeals about the overuse of

trespass warnings by DPS officers.
"We are still concerned that
there is no appeal to an indepen-
dent body," Steinberg said.
A letter written bythe Univer-
sity's undergraduate ACLU chap-
ter prompted the state chapter to
get involved in the trespass policy
reform, he said. Before the pro-
posed changes were introduced,
Steinberg said the University had
"perhaps the most egregious"
trespass policy in the state.
"We applaud the University of
Michigan for taking the ACLU's
constitutional concerns seriously,"
Steinberg said.

RELIEF EFFORTS
UMHS sends volunteers to aid in Joplin, MO

U' employees assist
victims of tornado
devastation
By CLAIRE HALL
Daily StaffReporter
Following the disastrous tor-
nado that struck Joplin, Missouri
two weeks ago, the University
of Michigan Health System has
answered the national call for
volunteers by the American Red
Cross to assist the victims of the
natural disaster.
Kara Gavin, UMHS director
of public relations, said her office
sent out an e-mail to 25,000 staff
members and students involved in
UMHS, urging individuals to vol-
unteer and assist those affected
by the tornado.
Gavin said the e-mail also
encouraged UMHS employees
with medical training - nurses,

physicians, psychologists and
social workers - to contact the
Red Cross if they were interested
in deploying to Joplin or other
southern states that were affect-
ed.
"The response ... hasbeenvery
gratifying," Gavin said. "Dozens
of our staff have indicated already
that they'd be willing to deploy."
Beginning this week and
running through the end of the
month, the Washtenaw County
chapter will offer two workshops
for UMHS volunteers serving
down south - one for general
health services and the other spe-
cifically for mental health profes-
sionals, Cieslinski said. She added
that the training will be short-
ened from the normal eight-hour
session to a three-hour session.
According to Cieslinski, the
Red Cross may be able to send
UMHS volunteers to Joplin as
early as Friday.
"I think that there are six

or seven people that are already
scheduled to take the health ser-
vices workshop and I have about
five social workers that will be
taking the mental health work-
shop," Cieslinski said.
Sam Warkentien, a UMHS
emergency room nurse, traveled
to Joplin two days after the dead-
ly tornado swept through the city
on May 22. A former intern at St.
John's Regional Medical Center
in Joplin, Warkentien said she
was eager to return to help with
the devastating aftermath of the
natural disaster.
"I went down there as an indi-
vidual," Warkentien said. "I didn't
go down there with the Red Cross
or as a representative from the
University of Michigan. I went
downthere as a person who's from
the area who wanted to help."
Warkentien said she spent
several days walking the streets of
Joplin with a group of fellow vol-
unteers providing medical advice,

food and information about where
to get clean water and other sup-
plies for those in need.
Warkentien added she hopes
to go back to Joplin later in the
month with the Red Cross.
"I prefer to go back with an
organization this time," Warken-
tien said. "I understand they want
organized helpers in the area to
help with disaster relief because
the aid was starting to get to a
point where it was getting a little
bit crazy."
Warkentien and her UMHS
co-workers who plan on deploying
to Joplin will be doing so on their
own vacation time in order to not
deprive UMHS patients of care,
according to Gavin.
"(UMHS is) always willing
to pass along the call for volun-
teers and, as much as we can help,
our staff lend their skills where
they're needed while also mak-
ing sure that our patients here are
served," Gavin said.

MSA President DeAndree
Watson wrote in an e-mail inter-
view he was honored and thrilled
to hear about the initiative, espe-
cially after being part of Students
4 Progressive Governance, an
organization that's goal was to
create a government model and
constitution that better serves
the students of the University.
"It makes me proud to see
that other students outside of the
University see value in (MSA's)
new structure," he wrote.
Watson added he believes the
features of MSA - which was
modeled after the U.S. govern-
ment - promotes democratic ide-
als that provide opportunities for
more students to engage in stu-
dent government.
"I think that our government
structure plays a significant role,"
he said. "I believe that we have
the most dynamic and democratic
structure in the area, which is a
great way to uphold our institu-
tional value of being the Leaders

we are setting the example."
In addition to modeling them-
selves after MSA, the UA student
government recently toured the
University's campus, including

the MSA chambers. UA students
met with University student men-
tors and MSA representatives and
were provided with the oppor-
tunity to ask questions about the
inner-workings of MSA.
After meeting with the stu-
dents, Watson wrote that he
noticed they were highly engaged
and enthusiastic.
"I absolutely love seeing stu-
dents begin taking active roles
in their communities at such an
early age," he wrote. "I am certain
that great things are in store for
each of them."
Watson added that creating
a lasting relationship between
MSA and high-achieving schools
like UA is a crucial step forward
in strengthening ties with com-
munities outside of the Univer-
sity, a major initiative of himself
and MSA Vice President Brendan
Campbell.
"Brendan and I had already
planned to use MSA as a means
of strengthening the efforts that
currently exist to reach out to
underrepresented communities,"
he said. "This was a major theme
of our platform as candidates, and
we intend to work diligently on
this issue over the next year."

Ann Arbor approves budget for 2012 fiscal year

City Council cuts
funding to police,
fire departments
By PATRICIA SNYDER
Daily StaffReporter
The City of Ann Arbor
approved a budget on May 31 for
the 2012 fiscal year, which includes
cuts to the fire and police depart-
ments and amendments to various
public programs and services.
City Council member Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1) said the newly
approved budget deals mostly with
moneys allocated to the general
fund, which is primarily used to
pay administrative and operational
expenses such as paying the sala-
ries of members of the police and
fire departments as well as for vari-
ous forms of upkeep around the
city.
The approved budget will
eliminate 30 fire and police depart-
ment positions - most of which are
currently empty - including five
police officers and five fire mar-
shals, Briere said. Retirements,
however, may save positions so
only two active members of the fire
department and four active mem-
bers of the police department will
be laid off, she said.
STOPPI

Briere said there was also a
debate within City Council over
an ordinance that passed provid-
ing 1 percent in additional funding
to the city's Public Art fund, which
Briere said the council viewed as
"a community driver ... and some-
thing that (could) increase eco-
nomic competition."
Briere added that the approved
budget will likely have both posi-
tive and negative impacts on the
city, including ridding the com-
munity of debt while potentially
threatening the needs of its citi-
zens.
"The city budget will ben-
efit from this approved budget,
because it's cleared its balance and
people know to some extent exact-
ly what we're spending money on,"
Briere said. "The city may find that
shrinking city government doesn't
meet all of the needs of all the peo-
ple living in the city."
City Council member Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) said trans-
ferring $86,000 from the general
fund balance to the human services
fund helped to lessen the effects of
significant cuts to the human ser-
vices account that were previously
made. The human services fund -
which would have been reduced by
9 percentin funding - gives money
to local, non-profit organizations,
a service that Kunselman said is

important.
"Ann Arbor is one of two cit-
ies across the state that actually
provides funding for various non-
profits for helpingwith human ser-
vices," he said.
An additional $7,000 from the
general fund balance was used to
allocate funds for a third primary
election - where he and two other
council members will be up for
reelection, he said.
Kunselman added that the
council - in a 6-to-5 vote - agreed
to provide an additional $90,000 to
the Parks & Recreation fund, spe-
cifically recreation.
Kunselman acknowledged that
cuts to the police and fire depart-
ments could affect the city, adding
that the cuts to these departments
"are significant concerns." Howev-
er, he said the current state of the
economy calls for these measures.
"We're also in a time with our
world and the economy, where it's
just not much that we can do," he
said. "We cannot borrow money to
pay for staff, we have to have a bal-
anced budget by law."
Kunselman said the budget
cuts do not represent a positive
circumstance for the city of Ann
Arbor, but added that a optimistic
outlook on the situation is needed.
"I don't think we can describe
any of this as positive, but I think

we can definitely represent our-
selves as being stoic and hope for a
better day in the years ahead," he
said.
The newly approved budget
represents the main "priorities"
of the city, which Kunselman said
is generating revenue, He added
that a parking agreement with the
Downtown Development Author-
ity would allow 17 percent of
parking revenue generated to be
allocated to city general funds.
Susan Pollay, executive direc-
tor of the Downtown Develop-
ment Authority, wrote in an e-mail
interview that the DDA said the
agreement with the city is part of
an effort to help the city amid a
struggling economy.
Pollay added that a major issue

surrounding the current financial
struggles is the issue of property
taxes, citing the University as an
example of an entity exempt from
payment of these gainful taxes.
"As an illustration, the U of M
has approximately 20 percent of
the property within the city limits,
and since the U of M is a nonprofit
it doesn't pay anytaxes," she wrote.
Pollay wrote that the approved
budget for the city of Ann Arbor
is directly correlated to the funds
provided by the state of Michigan.
"This year, on top of all the
other issues facing the city, the
state of Michigan passed a bud-
get that significantly reduced the
amount of state shared revenues it
will give back to the cities," Pollay
wrote.

Learning from Dr. Death
Parsing Kevorkian's message from his ego
ack Kevorkian, widely known for his support for eutha-
nasia, died painlessly from a thrombosis on June 3. In the
early '90s,. Kevorkian, a graduate from the University's
Medical School, thrust the right-to-die issue into the American
mainstream, and in the following years there were legislative
attempts both to block and legalize euthanasia. The complex
moral and legal intricacies of this issue were somewhat lost
with Kevorkian's theatrics, but that should not damage the merit
of his position - an autonomous individual, if they so choose,
should be allowed to end their suffering through death.

The Ivory Tower of the Univer-
sity canfeel like a dungeon at times.
It's only when you notice that all of
your friends are
within five years
of your age,
professors are
the only people
outside of that
bracket you've
interacted with
recently, and ANNA
you don't even CLEMENTS
remember how
to start a conver-
sation with someone who doesn't
know what a blue book is, that it
becomes clear you've become fully
socialized as a college student.
We're living in a microcosm, where
tragedies iiiclude parties getting
booted before 2 am., and stress
exists on a schedule. This might
be fun for now, but what happens
when we graduate and try to reen-
ter the "real world" only to realize
that it has become alien?
One of the nice things about the
University is that it's integrated
with the Ann Arbor community.
This makes it possible - easy even
- to get involved. We have classes
here such as Project Outreach and
Project Community, which place
students in'volunteer positions in
schools, prisons, hospitals, commu-
nity centers and more. Language
programs also offer opportunities
to connect with the "real world."
Through Proyecto Avance, Latino
Mentoring Association, students
are paired with adults and kids from
Spanish-speaking backgrounds to
work on English language skills and
help with homework, respectively.,
These all can become lasting con-
nections, and because of the rela-
tionships I developed in my Project
Community class, after the semes-
ter ended I returned to volunteer in
my placement location.
Besides coursework and volun-
teering, employment both on and
off-campus connects students with
the city. Students who do outreach
for University programs have the
opportunitytoconnectwith alumni
and prospective students through
phone calls, tours and hosting
events. For instance, Teaching and
Inspiring Environmental Steward-
ship brings visiting groups to the
Dana Building, incorporating tours
of the award-winning sustainabili-
ty center with other environmental
education activities. Off-campus
jobs can also connect students with
people they wouldn't otherwise
come into contact with. Especially
in smaller businesses with more of

a regular clientele, students can get
to know individuals outside of stu- 4
dent groups.
Why are interactions like this
important? Social theorists and
professionals can tell you: Know-
ing people means getting ahead.
Your volunteer coordinator might
recommend you for a job or your
client may drop information on off-
campus opportunities. Learning
the proper etiquette for conversing
with different people is important.
After attending an institution as
diverse as the University, it should
be expected that one would know
how to interact with people from a
wide range of social identities, not
just one's own. That sort of flex-
ibility is crucial to expanding per-
sonal opportunities.

Knowing
people means
getting ahead.

At the outset of Kevorkian's
radical pursuits, there were no
parameters to guide a physician
or regulate the death of a ter-
minal patient. Michigan had no
laws against physician-assisted
suicide, so when he was charged
with the murder of Janet Adkins,
he was found innocent, as there
was no specific law that he vio-
lated. He provided the termi-
nally ill Alzheimer's patient with
a machine that would deliver a
lethal dose of potassium chloride
if she desired it, and this was the
way she ended her life. It wasn't
until the enfant terrible killed a
patient himself that he was final-
ly sent to prison for murder.
The morality, medical appro-
priateness and legality of these
issues got lost in the wake of
Kevorkian's histrionics. Rath-
er than focusing on the issues
surrounding assisted suicide,
euthanasia became intimately
associated with "Dr. Death" and
its legitimacy waned. Rather
than seeking a forum to deter-

mine euthanasia's regulation,
Kevorkian continued to assist
suicides solely based on his and
his patients' views. Intuitively,
this may seem sufficient, but
these are precarious evaluations
especially when 50 percent of
the decision is coming from a
terminally ill patient.
Part of legalizing physician-
assisted suicide must include
a comprehensive and rigor-
ous review process that both
the patient and doctor must go
through before the treatment is
provided. Oregon, where eutha-
nasia is legal, requires the per-
mission of two doctors and a
terminal diagnosis predicting
death in fewer than six months,
yet these regulations are insuf-
ficient. At a minimum, there
should be a panel of medical pro-
fessionals that review euthanasia
requests. The patient should also
undergo a psychiatric evaluation
to determine his or her mental
health. If the patient is termi-
nally ill and mentally stable, a

medical professional trained for
euthanasia should provide the
means to perform such a task.
This issue has massive impli-
cations and asks humanity to
challenge very fundamental con-
cepts of life. But euthanasia's vol-
atile nature should not prevent it
from being explored and evalu-
ated. The fear of discussing a
macabre topic as well as the inev-
itable public backlash should not
prevent physicians from provid-
ing individuals a peaceful alter-
native to an agonizing death.
The complex nature of physi-
cian-assisted suicide requires
transparent and thorough over-
sight for death requests made by
patients. Kevorkian was brave
to foray into this area, but his
myopia damaged both his legiti-
macy and more importantly,
the legitimacy of his cause. His
actions show how this practice
needs more oversight, but also
how the medical paradigm must
be expanded for those unable to
meet an end as peaceful as his.

The ivory tower analogy for col-
lege makes methink about Rapun-
zel, trapped in a tower with no
escape besides her freakishly long
hair. The story has one of those not-
very-politically-correct endings
where she waits helplessly until she
is rescued by a prince. I don't really
know how he fits into this whole
metaphor, but my hunch is this: If in
college I surround myself with only
people like me, then I will build
up a sort of helplessness that will
separate me from accessing oppor-
tunities. And there is no hope of a
social-capital-superman to rescue
me by introducing me to everyone
I'll need to know post-grad.
Getting acquainted with people
outside of your own group can pro-
vide an avenue for learning about
life, but it can also make post-col-
lege culture shock less dramatic.
Between jobs, volunteering and
just varying venues for hanging
out, there are a plethora of places to
meet people who don't look like you,
talk like you or share your lifestyle.
It might not be comfortable at first,
but going to the University without
getting to know Ann Arbor is like
getting a sandwich with only the
lettuce - it serves its function, but
it's far from reaching its full poten-
tial in flavor and variety.

As a Spanish major and a Mexi-
can-American, I am interested in
understanding Latin American
culture. Cer-
tain classes
through
the Spanish
* department
- like His-
tory 348: Latin
America: The
National Peri- NICK
od and Span- BRINGARDNER
ish 430: Race
and Nation in
Latin America - have exposed me
to the breadth and richness of Latin
America. From taking these classes,
I, like many other historians, soci-
ologists and poets, realized how
illogical it is to brand people in the
United States as Latino. Latino is
not a race.
Latino is an American con-
struct and a blanket term covering
over 400 million people spanning
beyond three continents. Using
one simple term like Latino doesn't
begin to capture the complexity of
the people it includes, or the scope
of its use. To me, race implies color,
but Latinos cover the entire spec-
trum. They range from the whitest
of Spaniards (yes, even redheads) to
the piel morena (the U.S. standard
"Mexican or something" medium
brown skin tone) to the black of
Caribbean Spanish-speakers from
the African Diaspora who ended up
in every country from the Domini-
can Republic and Cuba to Argentina
and Venezuela. That's right; Latinos
can be black, white, red and yellow.
For some reason, the skewed Amer-
ican perception imposes its ideas of
racial identity onto people of this
obscure category. It puts Domini-
cans or Cubans (or any othernation-
ality with dark skin) in an odd spot.
How can they tell the census that
they're Hispanic/Latino and Black
at the same time? Bi-racial doesn't
exactly cover it either - the same
way mestizo didn't really cover
their collective history.
Collective culture also exists
between the many different eth-
nicities covered by Latino, but that
doesn't make any of them inter-
changeable. Similar to the way
an American may get offended by
being called Canadian by an igno-
rant foreigner, Cubans don't like
being mistaken for Peruvian or
Puerto Rican. Each country car-
ries an individual identity, but our
perception of Latino is limited to
the countries we are exposed to and
blends the rest together, making
Latino only Mexican or only Puer-


to Rican when it should be more
inclusive than that. Unfortunately,
its vibrant and diverse culture has
limited exposure in the U.S. and the
popular Latin perception has been
manufactured to mean something
different from what it is, and often
carries negative connotations of

name - my last name is German
and not Mexican. So I thought
learning Spanish and understand-
ing the culture would bridge the
perceived gap. During academic
breaks I would search for Spanish
novels to read and maintain fluency.
I remember two summers ago when
I really felt like I was Latino. My
entire reading list was comprised
of "Latino" novels: "Cronica de una
muerte anunciada" (Chronicle of
A Death Foretold), "The Mambo
Kings Play Songs Of Love", "The
Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao"
and "The Savage Detectives." But
then I had to catch myself during a
few moments because I, still with a
bit of lingering prejudice, wondered
why authors with names like Daniel
Alarc6n and Junot Diaz were writ-
ing in English. I realized I would
have been remiss if I did not accept
that moving to the United States
and having children who speak
English is part of Latino history.
Latino means so many things. So
using race as a means of identifica-
tion is problematic. We know that
already - we are college students.
We have probably beaten this "race"
horse to death both inside and out-
side the classroom. But that doesn't
mean everyone else is enlightened.
It takes close study and questioning
of a subject to fully understand it.
Acceptance of the broad concept of
Latino is easy, but striving to under-
stand the depth of the various cul-
tures within Latino is a better way
to approach the subject.

Some days I just can't win.
I went to a party last weekend.
It was one of those nights that
my friends had
persuaded me
to go out, and
I succumbed
like the social
weakling I
am to heavy-
weight peer
pressure - a VANESSA
mistake, I RYCHLINSKI
would find out
later. It was
an unusually dead Friday ,and
to top it off, it was raining. Once
we finally got to our destination
- a huge mansion-type house on
South Division - I was wet and
completely unenthused. Sitting
on the couch in the large living
room, I sulked, glowered even,
as I sipped on a very full-flavored
beer someone had given me.
After being angrily bored for
some time I decided to make the
most of my situation. I turned to
my buddy keeping me company on
the couch and said those fateful
words, "Hey, you wanna dance?
Let's dance!"
After about five minutes, I was
actually enjoying myself. There
were other people getting down.
My best friend had finally made
her way to the dance floor from
wherever she was in this mon-
strous house to join me. The DJ
was decent, and there were no
unwelcome undergrads trying any
nonsense. Sigh. Almost perfect.
Right on schedule, the fun-
sucking University Police chose
this moment to show up and issue
a noise violation. Most of the par-
ty-goers scattered by instinct, and
my friends and I decided to take
our leave. I walked over to the
couch, picked up my purse, which
had been knocked to the floor and
my phone was gone. I searched
everywhere, under tables and
the piano standing nearby. I even

Party foMf
ripped apart the couch, the scene
of my prior melancholy moodi-
ness. Oh the humanity - my
phone was gone.
Needless to say, I was angry.
A person that tends to see red
more often than not anyway, I
was completely incensed that my
phone had been filched from the
very room I had been standing in,
when I had left it unattended for
about fifteen minutes total, after
sitting on my derriere for the
entire night.
The story of the Awful Friday
Night is not over yet, however. I
walked home using a shortcut
to get through my parking lot
behind my apartment - the typi-
cal Ann Arbor hole-in-the-fence.
This hole has been mended sev-
eral times, though I once heard
a girl living below me yelling at
someone in the process of kick-
ing it, and it is quite handy, I will
admit. Upon squeezing through
the fence, I saw that the passen-
ger side mirror of my car, which
I habitually parked in the same
spot had been ripped off the side
of the vehicle.
After spending several days
phoneless, I looked at the call
information from the night the
phone was taken and the perpe-
trator had made a whole host of
text messages. I called one num-
ber after another. The story was
the same with every call - these
were people from my own phone
book, not the thief's like I had
thought originally. Whoever it
was had contacted around ten
people with offers of graphic sex-
ual favors. From looking at the
phone records, some of the con-
versations were quite extensive.
Good thing I have no shame, I
tell you. The list included ex-boy-
friends, an awful one-time hook-
up, girlfriends, gay friends - the
whole gamut. When I turned an
old phone on that day, I received
several texts from people appar-

ently attempting to follow up on
the dizzying array of promiscu-
ous fun I had suggested.
I found this night, besides an
exercise in anger management,
quite interesting. What is it about
students here at this school that
makes them think that they can
do whatever they want? True, no
lasting harm was caused. Both
of the situations can be fixed. I
ordered a new phone, I duct-taped
my mirror and I contacted every
person to explain what had hap-
pened (the ones who had errone-
ously thought that the sexting was
genuine lamely tried to tell me
that they knew it was all a joke).
The night was an
exercise in anger
management.
But none of that is the point. It
costs money to go to this school,
and it's the truth that most stu-
dents take classes and live here,
on the parental dime. I'm not an
exception to this, quite honestly.
But there is something seriously
wrong with a campus where stu-
dents think it is acceptable to
make a joke out of someone else's
property. At the end of the day,
it's not really about the damages.
It's about the fact that now I don't
park my car in a certain spot in
my own enclosed parking lot. It's
about the fact that someone I don't
know sitting near me at a party
could be a thief with an imbecilic
sense of humor. It's about the fact
that some people who live here
are apparently entitled assholes.
And that's just too bad.

TRESPASS
From Page 1
Mallory Jones, a former news 6
editor at The Michigan Daily and
former chair of the University's
chapter of the ACLU, said the
group became involved in chang-
ing the University's trespass poli-
cy because of the warning issued
against Andrew Shirvell - for-41
mer Michigan assistant attorney
general known for makingclaims
that former Michigan Student
Assembly President Chris Arm-
strong was tryingto instill a "rad-
ical homosexual agenda."
Jones said she believes the
former policy lacked clarity, and
the ACLU was concerned about
the balance of power between
DPS and the University commu-
nity.
"Parts of (policy) were just
very broad and kind of troubling
in terms of free speech issues,"
Jones said. '"So basically, we
were just worried about it and we
thought that it was kind of nerve-
wracking that DPS had so much
power when it came to banning
people from the entire campus
for breaking any University rule."
Jones said the one-year reex-
amination on trespass warnings
is the best improvement to the
policy, but she would have liked
to see appeals cases handled by a
third party.
"Before, if you were banned
with a trespass warning it was
for life, which we felt was a little
extreme," Jones said.
The University announced
the changes to thetrespass policy
on June 1, after a months-long
policy review conducted by Suel-
lyn Scarnecchia, University vice
president and general counsel
and Joe Piersante, interim execu-
tive director of DPS. At a press
briefing on June 1, Scarnecchia
said the review began in part
because of outcries from the Uni-
versity's undergraduate chapter
of the ACLU.
DPS is currently reviewing
approximately 1,800 adult and
200 juvenile trespass warnings
issued since 2001, and Piersante
said at the briefing he anticipates
rescinding about half of the issu-
ances bythe end of the summer.
The new policy will allow
officers to limit the scope of the
trespass warning to a part of one
campus or apply the warning to
the entirety of the three campus-
es. Scarnecchia said at the brief-
ing that the policy is not perfect,
but increased transparency and
detail have made it more useful.

'X-Men: First Class' proves brilliant

Marvel distinguishes
itself with mutants
and Kevin Bacon
By PROMA KHOSLA
Senior Arts Editor
Holy X-Men, Batman.
Rejoice, fans, for after the horrif-
ic bloodbath of2006's "X-Men: The
Last Stand", and
the enjoyable ****
but utterly for- X-Men:
gectable "X-Men
Origins: Wol- First Cass
verine" in 2009,
the X-Men fran- At Quality16
chise is back and and Rave
restored to its Marvel
former glory.
Bryan Singer, who directed the
brilliant "X-Men" and "X2: X-Men
United," returns to his roots
behind the scenes by providing the
story and producing "X-Men: First
Class." The result is distinguished
enough to forgive Singer for his
time apart from the mutants and
hope that he never, ever, strays
again.
Director Matthew Vaughn
("Kick-Ass") breathes new life
into the script, giving just the
right amount of screen time to

character development, action and
even those obligatory nuggets of
romance. Like its predecessors, the
film doesn't pretend to be strictly
true to the comic books. Rather, it
continues crafting the genesis of
the mutant phenomenon in film
form.
The film's opening is identical
to that of the 2000s series-opener,
"X-Men," featuring a young Erik
Lehnsherr (newcomer Bill Milner)
bending metal gates in World War
II-era Poland as he is separated
from his parents by a concentra-
tion camp. This sequence is just as
effective as it was in the first film,
even if it does save screenwriters
the creative hassle of coming up
with another kick-ass introduction.
After that and a brief stint at
a certain Westchester mansion,
the story unfolds in 1963 as Erik
(Michael Fassbender, "Inglouri-
ous Basterds") and Charles Xavier
(James McAvoy, "Wanted") find a
host of other mutants to join forces
with the CIA in order to thwart a
powerful mutant bent on starting
war amongst humans.
Ah, yes. That ruthless antago-
nist, Sebastian Shaw, is none other
than the Nazi who incited Mag-
neto's initial bursts of mutant mad-
ness and is played by the rascally
Kevin Bacon. As utterly bizarre as

it is to see Bacon as the villain in
a superhero movie, he plays Shaw
with casual coolness - like a bratty
billionaire used to getting what he
wants - which makes the charac-
ter just terrible enough to keep an
audience invested in Eric's vendet-
ta against him.
This explains all of the once-
and-future Magneto's ingrained
ideas about human inferiority and
the brotherhood of mutants. Fass-
bender's Magneto is perfection -
and that's saying something for a
character only ever played by Sir
Ian McKellan. He speaks four lan-
guages, goes through subtle emo-
tions faster than most of us can
chew a kernel of popcorn and, like
his costars, he's pretty damn easy
on the eyes.
The supporting cast shines,
particularly Jennifer Lawrence
("Winter's Bone") as Mystique and
Nicholas Hoult (TV's "Skins" in
the UK) as Hank McCoy. January
Jones (TV's "Mad Men") and Lucas
Till ("Battle: Los Angeles") provide
some one-dimensional eye candy in
the background, which is probably
best.
It's tempting, after seeing the
power of this script and cast (pun
intended), to want a franchise from
our First Class mutants, since that's
the way successful superhero mov-

"Finger to your head, do you think I'm pretty?"

ies roll nowadays. But the best part
of "X-Men: First Class" is how per-
fectly it completes the movie set. It
stands alone while connecting Pro-
fessor X and Magneto to the first
three - I mean, two - films and
answering the burning questions
about their friendship, enmity and
the origins of the iconic wheelchair
and dorky-looking helmet.
After 11 years and countless
other superhero movies to con-
tend with, the X-Men franchise is
as popular and relevant as ever -
for at the heart of the movies and
comic books lies the fundamental

question of how humans treatcthose
who stand out. Differences in cul-
ture, language and habit aren't any
weirder than blue skin or telepathy
(though the latter two are undoubt-
edly much cooler).
Mutation, after all, is the key
to our evolution. Though jarring,
change can often be golden. "First
Class" proves that the X-Men fran-
chise is as adaptable as the charac-.
ters who inhabit it. The new movie
stands apart from its fellows in the
best possible way.
As the film itself declares,
"Mutant and proud."

Jarrod Gorbel breathes acoustic soul into the Ark

By JULIA SMITH-
EPPSTEINER
ManagingArtsEditor
Jarrod Gorbel, lead vocalist and
guitarist of the disbanded group
The Honorary Title, is now on
summer tour
with his first Jarrod
* full-length solo
album Devil's Goe
Made a New Friday at 8 p.m.
Friend as the The Ark
folk- Ameri- $15
cana classic
soul opener for
S the critically acclaimed Irish rock
band, Bell Xl (best known for the
song "Eve, the Apple of My Eye"
that musically backed the notori-
ous lesbian kiss scene in season
two of "The D.C.").
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily, Gorbel explained: "It

was a pretty smooth transition
(from band to solo artist) but it's
an upward battle because people
know my band name. But they
don't know my name yet so it's a lit-
tle bit like starting over ... it's hard
work butI knew that going into it."
The Ark of Ann Arbor is stop
number five for Gorbel to promote
his solo acoustic voice. What Mich-
iganders have the opportunity to
hear live is his powerful vocals on
an arrangement of his 11 tracks
from Devil's Made a New Friend,
which Gorbel's pitch manages to
ascend over with a gritty texture.
His lyrics add a weightiness to
the sound with ideas about basic
desire, aging, God, replaced inno-
cence, breath, anticipation, love
and defeat.
Gorbel didn't hesitate when
asked where his songs are best con-
ceived.

"When I'm driving alone I come
up with a lot of stuff. Or probably
before I fall asleep in bed, an idea
will pop up. Those are the two
spots," Gorbel said.
To saturate his touring experi-
ence in a certain grounded raw-
ness, 33-year-old Gorbel added a
June "living room" concert series
to the tour where he will play small
intimate shows at the homes of
strangers who submit an applica-
tion.
He mentioned a somewhat sar-
castic concern with the living room
venues: "As long as there's no psy-
chopaths I think I'll be alright."
But Gorbel continued to say that
the living room intimate perfor-
mance always sets (itself) apart
from your average show. This type
of venue would not be easy or even
doable for some musicians but it is
for Gorbel.

"I just can just walk in a room
and play acoustically and it works
and its easy and it makes people
happy, so why not?" Gorbel said.
No reason I can think of (besides
the possible psychopaths offering
up their tainted abodes).
Besides Devil's Made a New
Friend, Gorbel released an EP titled
Bruises From Your Bad Dreams in
mid-February. This features a duet
with Nicole Atkins, "Miserable
Without You," a definite hit radio
song and I mean that in the best
way possible (an unbeatable, pack-
ing, feel-good, nostalgic, driving
tune all at once).
He explained how this striking
collaboration came together.
"I just did a bunch of live videos
of all the songs from my full-length
record, and I had her sing on one
of those videos," Gorbel said. "And
that's kind of how we met. But she

lives in my neighborhood, friends
of friends.
"I felt like our voices blended
well together, so when it came time
to record another song written as
a duet I thought she'd be perfect.
I just reached out to her and that
was it."
As lyrics in this Brooklyn-hit of
a song are "I'm miserable without
you/ So much so I have to/ Let go
of my hometown/ Brooklyn I was
so proud/ I'm leaving New York for
California," I asked the tattooed,
angel-faced artist if those lyrics
were coming from a real place and-.
if he had really made the move.
Gorbel responded, "No, but I
might."
I would recommend getting a fill
of Jarrod Gorbel live before he runs
away with his guitar to the West
Coast and meets the salty Atlantic-'.
Ocean with his soaring timbre.

Woody Allen makes molecules pulsate

4

ByJENNIFER XU
DailyArts Editor
Guess who's coming to town this
weekend? Why, it's Woody Allen of
course! The bespectacled director's
latest, "Midnight in Paris," his 42nd
feature film in the last 40 years, is
premiering at the Michigan The-
ater this Friday. Now I don't usually
like going to the movie theater and
getting ripped off by Harvey Wein-
stein and his fat cat pals over the
latest IMAX extravaganza, but for
Woody, I'm willing to do anything.
I have taken a day off from work,
gassed up the car and chosen my
outfit. I'll even cook myself a special
breakfast, all for this impending
event.
I've long been a fan of Allen's
work, having followed his career
with the fascination and obsession
as one might have the Beatles in
the 1960s. As of last year, I'd seen
all 41 of the director's feature films,
read all his books, as well as rented
a few other tangentially related
cinematic treasures. This includes
various episodes of his TV movie
"Don't Drink the Water," a docu-

mentary about his relationship with
jazz music and his new wife (and
adopted stepdaughter, yes) Soon-Yi
Previn and a really bizarre short by
Godard called "Meetin' WA,"where
blurry and off-centered frames
combine to make some sort of New
Age nonsense (it wasn't good, don't
watch it).
It's difficult to explain why this
man has affected me throughout
my formative years and how he
remains so inextricably linked to
my life. Since I'm not Jewish, don't
have marriage problems nor do I
live in New York City, alot of people
question my boundless passion for
his oeuvre. There's nothing I can
say to these remarks except smile
and turn away.
My first induction into the Allen
canon was "Match Point." It was a
movie unlike anything I had seen
before, packing such a mess of reve-
lations into so short a space of time,
it took my breath away. I couldn't
get enough. I wanted to live in that
world, partake in pseudo-intellec-
tual conversations about art and
music and Fellini, say la-di-dah,
la-di-dah in big floppy hats and ties


and sit on a park bench swoonily
appraisingthe New York skyline.
I'm not alone in my infatuation.
They say in France people go gaga
over his newest releases, lining up
on every street corner of the Rue
des Bladiguigu (this is not a real
place, by the way) in order to catch
his latest release, almost as if it were
a legendary rock concert. Here it's
not so different, though the way we
approach it is a splash more incog-
nito. I plan on seeing "Paris" at the
Maple Art Theater in Bloomfield
Hills, a deserted brownstone build-
ing with just three screens to its
name, that shares a warehouse-like
parking lot with the Independent
Bank next door. But walk inside the
modest abode and you'll find a veri-
table hubbub of a scene: Old Jewish
ladies, clutchingtheir monocles and
pearls hoarded from bygones past,
that remember going to the the-
ater the day that "Annie Hall" pre-
miered, the magic that seeped into
the dimly lit room when Alvy Singer
bowed his head and faltered, "Annie
and I broke up." It's a little bit akin
to living in an Edith Wharton novel
- without the condescension, of
course.
There's been a lot of talk about
"Paris" being a return to form for
Woody, a zingier, fluffier departure
from his usual work that recalls his
1980s love letters to New York City,
a la "Radio Days" or maybe even
"Broadway Danny Rose." This spot
of news was released in the effort
to get more butts in seats come
opening night, but whether it flops
or flies is irrelevant in the larger
scope of things.
I've touched upon this in a
review I wrote last fall on "You
Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"
- namely that my brethren, the
faithful Woody Allen devotees,
will come in droves regardless
of whether we think the movie
will be good or bad or merely OK.
We've become immune to the crit-
ics that grace the virtual pages of
Rotten Tomatoes and turned a
blind eye to the white hairs creep-
ing into the leading man's lustrous
mane. For us it's still 1970, Woody
and Diane Keaton are the Holly-
wood It Couple and Soon-Yi is but
a fetus percolating in some Korean
lady's womb.
It's weird, but this time capsule
effect has become problematic

cally evaluate these films: Every

day in the theater. I loved "Curse of

and "Melinda and Melinda." This
might make me terminally unfit to
be a critic, but I don't really care.

KEVORKIAN
From Page 1
sions, said Kevorkian "was a
major historical figure in modern
medicine."
However, Markel said that
while Kevorkian sparked conver-
sation about suicide for those not
necessarily struggling with men-
tal health issues like depression,
he might not have taken the right
approach.
"(Kevorkian) sent the right
message, if you believe that, but
he was the wrong messenger,"
Markel said.
As a person, Markel said Kev-
orkian was opinionated and "held
his own" and because of this
never doubted his personal verac-
ity in his beliefs.
"I never questioned his integ-
rity in what he believed in,"
Markel said.
John Finn, medical direc-
tor of palliative care at St. John's
Hospital and former executive
medical director of Hospice of
Michigan, knew Kevorkian and
described the doctor as someone
he respected despite the fact that
he found him to be "a very bizarre
man."
"He's not a man you can have
a conversation with," Finn said.
"When you looked in his eyes,
they were empty like black holes.
You'd get a chill."
Finn, however, credited Kev-
orkian with attempting to solve
the problems of the American
healthcare system, though he
said he believes his methods were
unjust.
"He identified the problem,
which is physicians failing in
-their responsibilities to relieve
suffering, but his methods were
unorthodox and inappropriate,"
he said.
He added that many of Kev-
orkian's patients were isolated,
lonely and potentially depressed
and therefore in no state to
mindfully choose whether to live
or die. Throughout his career,
 Finn said he's seen that people
who are terminally ill usually
want to live longer, so Kevork-
ian's patients were atypical and
with certain assistance may have
chosen to live out their natural
lives.
In a June 3 press conference,
Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's
lawyer for his trials throughout
the 1990s, said that while others
challenged Kevorkian's motives,
he stayed strong in his beliefs.
"When politicians and
churchmen and medical societ-

ies asserted their claim that only
they could make decisions for suf-
fering and dying people, Dr. Jack
Kevorkian had the strength of his
own conviction to risk his own
freedom, and at times, his own
life for the rights of his patients,"
Fieger said.
Fieger added that Kevork-
ian revolutionized the concept
of suicide by working to help
people end their own suffering
because he believed physicians
are responsible for alleviating
the suffering of patients, even if
that meant allowing patients to
die.
"Dr. Jack Kevorkian didn't
seek out history, but he made his-
tory," Fieger said.
Maria Silveira, professor
of internal medicine, said she
became involved with palliative
care in part because of the atten-
tion Kevorkian brought to the
complex issue of unintended suf-
fering.
"(He) had a tremendous
impact and fueled the public
awareness of unintended suffer-
ing and the need to address it,"
Silveira said.w
Silveira added that the atten-
tion he received especially affect-
ed the legal code of Michigan and
pushed legislators to make assist-
ed suicide illegal in 1994 as well
as lead to the development of the
Michigan Advisory Committee
on Pain and Symptom Manage-
ment.
Peter Jacobson, professor
of health law and policy in the
School of Public Health, said he
disagrees with the belief that
Kevorkian greatly impacted the
medical system. He said that in a
time when debate over the issue
was desperately needed, Kevork-
ian brought attention to himself
rather than the patients who
needed care.
"He deflected the impor-
tant debate with the potentially
criminal behavior of his actions,"
Jacobson said. "Juries didn't like
how he went about his actions,
but a lot of the people would like
the choice (of what care they
receive)."
Jacobson added that in a sys-
tem where it is acceptable to aid
patients in death, it is necessary
to have checks in place - like
two observing physicians and a
more careful analysis of patients'
cases to see if their illnesses can
be treated - in order to best serve
the public.

Tressel says Ohio State will prevail against'M'

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily SportsEditor
"Don't forget: On Nov. 26 we're
going to kick (Michigan's) ass!"
I With the sun beating down on
him in 90-degree weather, Jim
Tressel sounded like it was the first
day of fall camp.
In Tressel's first public address
since resigning as head football
coach at Ohio State - a gathering of
200-plus fans outside his Columbus
home - the 58-year-old gave the
crowd exactly what they were look-
ing for, taking one last stab at rival
Michigan.
The embattled coach stepped
down last Monday amidst months
of swirling accusations and specu-
lations surrounding the entire
Buckeye football program.
With Luke Fickell officially
named as the interim coach to
replace Tressel, students in Colum-
bus decided to honor Tressel,
who left with a 9-1 all-time record
against the Wolverines.
Rather than go ahead with plans
for a Mirror Lake jump for Tres-
sel as originally planned, Ohio
State seniors Tawni Shaffer and
.*ndrew Haviland organized a col-

lective effort to show their support
for Tressel's 10 years at the helm of
Buckeye Nation. At 6 p.m. Saturday,
a group of more than 200 walked
from Lane Road Park in Upper
Arlington to Tressel's home.
And Tressel - with his wife
Ellen - met them with open arms.
"We're going to be Buckeyes
for life," Tressel said with his arm
around his wife. "What's that old
saying? Buckeye born and bred, a
Buckeye 'til I'm dead."
The doorstep rally lasted about
25 minutes. Tressel and his wife
posed for pictures on the porch
of their home, shook hands and
thanked those in attendance for
their support.
"Honestly, even with all the
things that have happened these
last two months, we really thought
Coach Tressel deserves us to recog-
nize all the good things he's done,
no matter what comes out (later),"
Shaffer said Monday. "He's done so
many things for the university, so
many things to help athletes.
"Every person has their faults."
Students, alumni and fans alike
sang the alma mater and held
up signs reading, "You're in Our
Prayers," "We Support You, Jim!"

and "We Love You, Coach Tressel."
A similar rally took place in Colum-
bus when then-head coach Woody
Hayes was fired in 1978.
For a coach whose downfall was
covering up scandal involving doz-
ens of players receiving improper
benefits from a Columbus tattoo-
parlor owner, the gathering was
nothing short of a celebration.
"I'm still a Buckeye through and
through," Nick Jack, an Ohio State
student, told The Plain Dealer. "I
love the team and I love the coach-
es. I've always thought really highly
of (Tressel) and after this night, it
takes it to another level."
But the students might be singing
another tune when the 2011 season
comes around this fall.
Five of Ohio State's key play-
ers, including quarterback Terrelle
Pryor, running back Boom Herron
and wide receiver DeVier Posey, are
suspended for the first five games of
the season. In addition, the NCAA
ruling regarding Tressel and Ohio
State's iniquities is expected to be
released mid-season.
But while celebratingthe coach's
success puts a pretty face on Colum-
bus for now, Tressel's ousting might
simply be scratching the surface on

a troubling punishment for Ohio
State.
"Down here at Ohio State, we
really do still support him," Shaf-
fer said. "Some have some hard
feelings, but we just have to wait
and see what happens. No matter
what, we're pretty forgiving. Even if
something else were to come out, I
don't think it would change the stu-

Like every good get-together in
Columbus, before the crowd dis-
persed from Tressel's driveway, a
round of "We Don't Give a Damn
About the Whole State of Michi-
gan" ensured that the rivalry hasn't
lost any luster.
"Buckeye Nation, we'll still back
up the football team," Shaffer said.
"It's the biggest rivalry, I think it'll
still be going on strong this year."

Former Ohio State coach Jim Tresses resigned Monday after 10 years in Columbus.

MEN S GOLF
'M' places 10th, Kim
takes third at NCAAs

Foote, Irons say OSU not alone

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Writer
A day into the NCAA Champion-
ships, the Michigan golf team didn't
seemtohaveit. TheWolverinesshot
a combined 307 through 18 holes
and stood in 25th place out of the
30-team field.
But then, led by senior Lion Kim,
Michigan came charging back the
next two days to grab the No.10 spot
in the country. The 10th-place finish
is the Wolverines' second-best per-
formance since 1952. The 2009 team
finished sixth overall.
And Michigan was oh-so-close
to putting itself into the next round
of the NCAA Championships. The
Wolverines' 892 three-day total
was just three strokes off of Duke,
which was the final qualifier for the
eight-team match play tournament
that followed Tuesday-Thursday's
stroke play.
"Obviously we are disappointed
we did not advance," Michigan
coach Andrew Sapp said through
the athletic department. "We really
fought the final two rounds to put
ourselves in a position to sit on the
final hole to see if we made it. It is
painful to miss by a few shots rather
than 20, but after being tied for 25th
after the first day and to see us even
have a chance to make match play, I
could not be any more proud of this
team. They have a lot of heart."
Kim's 215 over the three days
spurred Michigan's surge up the
leaderboard in Stillwater, Okla. That
score earned Kim third place in the
individual competition.
His 73 on Thursday marked the
final round of his historic Michi-
gan career - perhaps the best in
Wolverine history. Kim earned his
second All-American honor to put
himself in the company of just four
other Michigan golfers. And his
trip to Augusta National earlier this
spring marked the first time a Wol-
verine competed in the Masters.
"Lion has had an unbelievable
career," Sapp said. "He was a tre-
mendous player. He was a tremen-
dous leader. He was a tremendous
representative of this University. He
gave all he had for four years and it
was my honor to have been a part of
his golfing career.
"We will certainly miss him, but I
know he has helped shape this pro-
gram into what it is today. He will be
remembered for a long time."

But it wasn't just Kim doing the
work to lift Michigan15 spots in two
days. The other four Wolverines
were crucial in leading the charge
back up the leaderboard.
"After the first round, we could
have packed up our tents and gone
home," Sapp said. "We did not do
that. We fought tooth and nail for
the last two days and really gave
ourselves the best shot at advancing.
For them to do that and not give up
really shows the character of these
young men. (Junior) Matt (Thomp-
son) had a sensational final day with
eight birdies and sophomore Jack
(Schultz) made so many up and
downs for par today to really help
this team.
"Even (freshman) Joey (Garber)
and (sophomore) Rahul (Bakshi)
really played with resiliency and
fought back after slow starts today.
I am just so proud of them."
Thompson's 70 on Thursday put
him in 20th place overall with 220
and Garber finished 56th highlight-
ed by his 72 on Wednesday.
Their emergence gives the team
two key pieces for continuing their
success into next year. Only senior
Alexander Sitompul joins Kim in
graduating this year.
"With four of the five start-
ers returning, they really gained
some valuable experiences," Sapp
said. "Hopefully, it builds a hunger
inside of them to want to get back
(to the NCAA Finals) next year and
go even farther. I am just so proud
of how hard this team worked and
the effort they put in each and every
day. We are looking forward to the
future because it is bright."

"Any of the stuff that went on

Irons said it was "common" to

And Tressel's ignorance towards
Pryor's new cars, which, accord-
ing to ESPN, has become the new

"I think it's hard to imagine that

"Anybody who got a new car

The details emerging from
Ohio State and even the situation
surrounding quarterback Cam
Newton at Auburn - in which
Newton's father allegedly brokered

rewards - are the norm for Irons.
"Especially with some other

Mustangs were prohibited from

"It's common," Irons said. "I've
