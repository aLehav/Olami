'M' players off to hot summer start

By JAKE LOURIM
Managing Sports Editor
The Michigan baseball team
suffered its share of growing
pains last season, flirting with the
.500 mark all season against an
average Big Ten.
But a change of scenery has
been good to the Wolverines
this summer as they tune up
in summer leagues around the
country.
Michigan players are seeing
time in the Cape Cod League, the
New England Collegiate Baseball
League, the Coastal Plain League
down south and the Prospect
League throughout the Midwest
and the Great Lakes.
These summer leagues,
most competitively the Cape
Cod League, give players an
opportunity to stay in shape
over the summer while away
from college. Any player can play
provided that he does not get
paid and has college eligibility
remaining.
The Daily does a quick
rundown of the Wolverines in
action this summer.
Senior outfielder Jackson
Glines, Brewster Whitecaps/
Cotuit Kettleers (Cape Cod
Baseball League): Glines has
played in just seven games for
Brewster, but he made them
count. He was 8-for-21 - good
for a team-leading .421 average -
with two RBI and a run scored.
But he was just a temporary
outfielder for Brewster and was
released early in the season when
the Whitecaps regained their
regulars. Since joining Cotuit,
Glines has cooled off, hitting.242
in nine games with six runs and a
stolen base.
Junior infielder Travis
Maezes, Brewster Whitecaps
(CCBL): Maezes ranks second for
the Whitecaps in batting, trailing
only his Michigan teammate
Glines. In 17 games, he's hitting
.385 with 12 runs, a homer and
five RBL He has added two stolen
bases.

Junior infielder/right-
handed pitcher Jacob
Cronenworth, Orleans
Firebirds (CCBL): Cronenworth,
Michigan's last season, has
pitched in nine games for a total
of 12.1 innings. He leads the
league with five saves and has a
2.18 earned-run average. His bat
has been slumping this summer
with just three singles and eight
strikeouts in 24 at-bats.
Junior left-handed pitcher
Evan Hill, Brewster Whitecaps
(CCBL): Hill, who developed
into Michigan's ace last season,
has been one of Brewster's most
reliable pitchers. His 1.92 ERA
is second among pitchers with
at least 10 innings pitched, and
he has also shared some of the
closing duty, ranking fifth in the
league in saves. In his only start,
he lasted just 3.2 innings and
gave up six runs - three earned
- with six hits and two walks.
Sophomore catcher Harrison
Wenson, St. Cloud Rox
(Northwoods League): Wenson
has struggled in the Northwoods
League, hitting .210 in 81 at-bats
- second-most among four
catchers on the team. He has four
doubles but also 24 strikeouts and
has the worst average among the
catchers.
Junior right-handed pitcher
Donnie Eaton, Kalamazoo
Growlers (Northwoods
League): Control issues have
plagued Eaton this summer.
He pitched 23.1 innings with
a team-leading 0.77 ERA in 13
appearances for Michigan last
season. Though he walked 16
for the Wolverines, he got out of
trouble with 26 strikeouts and
just eight hits. This summer, he
hasn't been so lucky, walking 19
and surrendering 25 hits in 24.1
innings for a 5.54 ERA.
Sophomore infielder
Hector Gutierrez, Danbury
Westerners (New England
Collegiate Baseball
League): Gutierrez is another
underclassman who has
struggled with the bat, hitting
just .200 in 65 at-bats. He has
drawn seven walks and stolen
a team-high four bases but also
struck out 21 times, tied for the
team lead.


Fifth-year senior catcher
Kendall Patrick, Sanford
Mainers (NECBL): Patrick is
another catcher who figures to
be in the conversation for the
starting role next year after the
graduation of Cole Martin. He's
hitting .228 with a home run, four
RBI and nine walks in 21 games
for Sanford. He has also been hit
by pitch a league-leading nine
times.
Sophomore left-hander
Brett Adcock, Sanford Mainers
(NECBL): Adcock is picking up
where he left off in Ann Arbor
after a strong finish to the season
earned him BigTenAll-Freshman
Team honors. In two starts for
Sanford, Adcock is 2-0 with a 3.27
ERA, includinga five-inning, one-
hit shutout with nine strikeouts
on Monday.
Sophomore infielder
Ramsey Romano, Morehead
City Marlins (Coastal Plain
League): Romano missed of his
freshman season the beginning of
the summer with a wrist injury,
but he's off to a hot start now. In
six games and nine at-bats, he has
four hits, two RBI and two walks.
Since returning to action in late
June, he has been used mostly as
a pinch-hitter.
Sophomore infielder Carmen
Benedetti, Morehead City
Marlins (CPL): After a strong
freshman season at Michigan,
Benedetti also didn't play his first
game this summer until June 29.
So far, he's 1-for-4 with a single, a
walk and a strikeout.
Redshirt sophomore Cam
Wysocki, Danville Dans
(Prospect League): Wysocki's
strong start this summer earned
him a spot in the Prospect League
All-Star Game, where he pitched
a scoreless inning with two hits
and a walk. Overall, he's 2-2 with
a 2.38 ERA and two saves in 15
relief appearances. He's also
2-for-3 at the plate.
Sophomore right-hander
Mac Lozer, Danville Dans
(Prospect League): Though not
in as much action as Wysocki,
Lozer has also been strong for
Danville. He's 1-0 with a 3.60
ERA in eight relief appearances
and has struck out 13 in 10
innings.

By MAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Known for his quick starts off
the blocks into the pool, former
Michigan swimmer Tyler Clary
couldn't have gotten a much later
jump into his most recent venture.
Clary won the gold medal in
the 200-meter backstroke at the
2012 London Olympics, fulfilling
a dream and setting an Olympic
record in the process. Shortly after
those Olympics, though, Clary
was presented an opportunity to
pursue another childhood dream -
race car driving.
The seed for Clary's pavement
dreams were planted at a young
age, ironically through his other
passion of swimming. The Clary
family often went to the Fontana
Speedway to run a merchandising
booth to fundraise for his club
team.
"Being around the cars all the
time, I knew it was something that
I wanted to do," Clary said. "I just
never really had the opportunity
until after the London Olympics."
An interview with Dave Despain
on the popular auto racing show
WindTunnel publicized Clary's
interest in racing, leading to
Benny Gordon contacting Clary
on Twitter, offering a test run in a
stock car.
Gordon had driven on the
Nationwide Series and been around

the sport a long time, but had never
met Clary prior to offering him an
introduction to the sport he had
always harbored interest in. It
must have been surprising to both
when Clary's test run placed him
just a quarter-second slower than
the racers who had competed on
the same track in Kenly, North
Carolina just hours earlier in a
ProCup race.
More impressive than that was
that it was just the second time
Clary had even driven a manual
transmission car, a significant
barrier to racing that Clary
apparently handled quite easily.
Still, a lot of other things had to
fall into place for Clary's lifelong
interest to materialize into a
buddingcareer opportunity.
"The nice thing about being
in Charlotte is that all of those
opportunities are really close,"
Clary said. "So that lessensthe time
commitment needed in order to get
out to the track and develop. My
schedule works out perfectly with
a couple of the series. For example,
the U.S. Legends Summer Shootout
Series I'm able to do because we
don't have practice Wednesday
mornings."
Moving to Charlotte, while
not solely fueled by his endeavor
to the race track, is a clear signal
of the drive Clary possesses,
willing to uproot himself from a
comfortable situation training at

Michigan to live where his passions
can intersect. When he finishes
swimming, he says, he plans to
pursue auto racing as a full-time
career.
Clary acknowledges the hurdles
that remain between where he
is now and the point he would
someday like to be - the Sprint
Cup Series. While currently
training for the 2016 Olympics in
Rio de Janeiro, he is also working
onreachingalevel ofdrivingwhere
he can earn sponsorships to drive
faster cars on more reputable tours.
But he's also embracing the fun
aspects of being a semi-pro race car
driver.
Clary reminisced about one
of his first test runs in Barstow,
California, where he and his
girlfriend, Caroline, were allowed
to take a trophy truck out for a
spin, going 100 miles per hour
through the desert. He hopes to
do something similar with friends
from his other job, the one that's
already earned him national fame
and some impressive hardware.
"There's been a lot of support
(from the swimming community)
and a lot of people that think it's
cool," he said. "One of the things I
do want to do with a couple of my
swim friends is get them together
at a track and getthem in a car with
me and see if I can't scare the crap
out of them going really fast on a
road course."

Gardner and
Funchess for
Maxwell, Ryan and
Clark for Bednarik
By JAKE LOURIM
ManagingSports Editor
The Preseason Watch Lists
for the National College Football
Awards Association awards come
outfrom July 7 to July 18. On Mon-
day, two Michigan players made
the Maxwell Award watch list and
two more made it for the Bednarik
Award.
Senior defensive end Frank
Clark, Bednarik Award (best
defensive player): Clark has
struggled with inconsistency for
parts of his career, but he earned
All-Big Ten second-team honors
last season. He made 43 tackles
and led the team with 12 tack-
les for loss while starting all 13
games. His 4.5 sacks were sec-
ond on the team to linebacker
Cam Gordon, and his two fumble
recoveries were first.
The 6-foot-2, 270-pound
Cleveland native topped his
freshman and sophomore years
combined last season in tackles,
tackles for loss and sacks, putting
his name on the list of 76 play-
ers to watch for the nation's best
defensive player.
Fifth-year senior linebacker
Jake Ryan, Bednarik Award
(best defensive player): Ryan
also made the watch list for best
defensive player despite missing
the first five games last season
with a torn ACL he suffered last
spring. He managed to play in the
last eight games, however, start-
ing five and making 30 tackles,
4.5 for loss.
Ryan made a name for himself
as a redshirt freshman in coach
Brady Hoke's first season, play-
ing in every game and starting 11.
He then broke out in 2012 with 88
tackles, 4.5 sacks and 16 tackles
for loss, the last of which ranked
third in the Big Ten.
Fifth-year senior quarter-
back Devin Gardner, Maxwell

Award (college player of the
year): Gardner enters his sec-
ond full year as a starter with 16
starts under his belt. He started
12 games last year, missing the
Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl with
injury, and he earned All-Big
Ten honorable mention from the
media.
He passed for 2,960 yards and
21 touchdowns last season and
added 483 rushing yards and
11 more scores on the ground.
His 376 total yards and five total
touchdowns against Notre Dame
earned him Maxwell Award
Player of the Week honors, and
he set a program record with 503
passing yards against Indiana.
This year, he'll cap a career that
he started as a third-string quar-
terback in 2010 and continued as
a starting wide receiver in 2012
before assuming the starting
quarterback role late in 2012.
Junior wide receiver Devin
Funchess,MaxwellAward(col-
lege player of the year): Funch-
ess will officially move to wide
receiver this year after appearing
in every game and starting 15 at
tight end his first two seasons.
Last season, he caught 49 pass-
es for 748 yards and six touch-
downs, earning first-team All-Big
Ten honors from the media. His
748 yards were a program record
for a tight end.
This season, he figures to
step into a starting role at wide
receiver to fill a need. The Wol-
verines lose wideout Jeremy Gal-
lon (1,373 yards) from last year's
team, and the top returning
receiver is redshirt sophomore
Jehu Chesson, who caught 15
passes for 221 yards last season.
Notable upcoming watch list
announcements: July 14, Butkus
Award (nation's best lineback-
er);, July 15, Biletnikoff Award
(nation's best wide receiver); July
16, Davey O'Brien Award (nation's
best quarterback); July 18, Walter
Camp Award (nation's most out-
standingplayer).

ley's ("Broadchurch") character
is forced to be the "mysterious
old figure who knows about the
threat" for the first few episodes,
but once they allow him to get
more involved in the story, he's
great.
"The Strain" isn't a perfect
show. The first few episodes had
pacing issues and couldn't quite
match the tension of the pilot.
However, the show's scares
are effective and the produc-
ers filled the cast with fantastic
actors. Despite the problems,
once the story picked up and the
scares became more plentiful, it
became clear that "The Strain"
was worth the huge investment
from FX.

A2 Election Commision meets
to discuss response to ballot error

City Council approves
Main Street road closures
for football Saturdays

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
Tom Wieder, Bob Doscola's attorney, voices concerns about the state's desicion to count the misprinted ballots at a meeting
of the Ann Arbor Election Commission Tuesday.

After name omitted,
Ward 3 candidate
files motion in
federal court
By SHOHAM GEVA
ManagingNews Editor
Tuesday morning, the Ann
Arbor Election Commission
met to discuss issues with mis-
printed absentee ballots for the
August primaries, focusing on
a motion filed in federal court
Monday that seeks to bar the
city from counting one of the
races on the incorrect ballots.
The ballots, which left off the
name of Ward 3 City Council
candidate Bob Dascola due to a
proofing error, were sent out to
roughly four hundred individu-
als in the ward June 20. After
the error was pointed out to the
city clerk's office on June 27,
new, corrected ballots were sent
out on June 30.
Dascola is running in the
Democratic primary against
Julie Grand and Sam McMullen.
No Republican or independent
challengers are currently run-
ning for the seat.
On the day the error was dis-
covered, the state Bureau of
Elections initially instructed
the city clerk's office that all
votes on the first, incorrect bal-
lot except for the Ward 3 City
Council seat should be counted
if the second, corrected ballot
wasn't returned. However, on
June 30 the state reversed its
position, instead instructing

the clerk to count every vote on
the first ballot, including for the
Ward 3 seat, if the voter didn't
return a second ballot. Only if
a second ballot was returned
would the first ballot be dis-
carded.
In a letter to the clerk's
office, Christopher Thomas,
state director of elections, cited
potential concerns about voter
disenfranchisement as rationale
for the new decision.
As of a motion filed Monday
afternoon, Dascola's campaign
is contesting the state's revised
instructions and asking the
court to enjoin the city from
counting Ward 3 votes on the
incorrect ballots. During the
public commentary section of
the meeting, Dascola's attorney
Tom Wieder said it is the cam-
paign's position that a ballot can
only be counted as a ballot if it's
an accurate representation of
the race, and that the state has
not yet presented any legal evi-
dence to prove the opposite.
"It's a piece of paper that has
two names on it but that's not
the contest in this primary," he
said of the original ballot. "To
say that you can count votes
from a non-contest just doesn't
make any sense as far as we're
concerned."
City attorney Stephen
Postema, one of the commis-
sion's three members along with
City Clerk Jacqueline Beaudry
and John Seto, Ann Arbor chief
of police, said at the meeting that
the city will look to the courts
for guidance on whether or not
the votes should be counted.
He added that he considers the

issue to be primarily between
the state and Dascola, though
the lawsuit is filed with the city.
"When I talk about the dis-
pute, there is a dispute between
the state and Mr. Dascola as to
this interpretation of the count-
ing of the ballots," Postema said.
"The state has clearly weighed
in in a manner that (the Dascola
campaign) disagrees with, and
that's why the court's going to
rule and of course we will follow
any ruling."
The city attorney's office has
not yet expressed an opinion on
whether or not they believe the
votes are valid. Postema said the
city's position will be made clear
in a response to Dascola's motion
that will be filed with the court
this week. He added that the city
is still waiting to receive some
additional materials from the
state about the issue.
Beaudry reported at the
meeting that only somewhere
between zero and ten voters
have returned just a first bal-
lot thus far. She added that her
office has also been telephoning
affected voters in the area in an
effort to reduce that number.
However, margins in City
Council Democratic primaries
have traditionally been tight -
in 2010, current Councilmember
Stephen Kunselman (D-Ward 3)
won the Ward 3 primary by six
votes - and Wieder said espe-
cially given how close races have
been, the misprinted ballots are
a concern for the campaign.
The commission will meet
again next week to continue
discussing the issue and receive
updates on the lawsuit.

Ann Arbor residents
express concern over
traffic, accessibility
to downtown area
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Editor in Chief
At their bimonthly meeting
Monday night, the Ann Arbor City
Council debated proposed road
closures during football games at
Michigan Stadium after receiving
input from John Seto, Ann Arbor
Police Chief.
The council addressed the clo-
sure of northbound Main Street
three hours prior to games and the
closure of southbound Main Street
one hour prior - procedures that
have elicited concerns from resi-
dents in the area.
Following a 2013 report from
the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security, Ann Arbor Police and
University Police implemented
new safety procedures regard-
ing traffic flow around the sta-
dium. After receiving input from
the community, several proposed
modifications to the procedures
were enacted in an effort to allevi-
ate congestion for local residents.
Seto held a forum on July 1 to
discuss the potential impacts of
road closures with city residents.
"It's a balance between security
and inconvenience," Seto said at
the July 1 meeting.
At Monday's meeting, Seto said
his experience with crowds during
the 2013 season led him to believe
that closing northbound traffic
three hours prior was an appropri-
ate response, because it allowed
officers to secure half the road
before the largest crowds began
descending on the stadium.
After hosting the public forum,
he noted that residents primarily
voiced concerns over post-game
congestion, not the pre-game clo-
sures.
Councilmember Jack Eaton
(D-Ward 4) opposed the mea-

sure, stating that he was generally
opposed to the closing of any roads
on game days. However, Eaton
- along with Ann Arbor Mayor
John Hieftje - commended Seto's
efforts to involve community
members in the implementation of
such procedures.
Also opposed to the proposal,
Councilmember Sabra Briere (D-
Ward 1) expressed doubts that the
measures added considerably to
security, and questioned why simi-
lar closures were not instituted
after the games if vehicle traffic
was considered such a danger. She
suggested that Council amend the
proposal to close northbound traf-
fic for one hour after the game.
Seto said after games, police
must balance security with the
need to move fans away from the
stadium efficiently.
"We've made those consider-
ations and thought about it last
year," Seto said. "To reduce the
risk to stadium (patrons), one of
the ways is to get people out of
there as quickly as possible."
He also noted that, once closed,
the road could be overrun with
pedestrian traffic and therefore
difficult to reopen until all the
crowds fully disperse.
Those in favor of the proposal
cited the 2013 federal report and
the general need to promote safety
as justification for any inconve-
nience in traffic flow.
"This came from federal securi-
ty officials," Councilmember Mar-
gie Teall (D-Ward 4) said. "The
idea that we would second guess
this is kind of scary to me."
"When you have vehicles and
that many pedestrians at the
beginning of the game, we certain-
ly can't stop everything, butwe can
certainly minimize the opportu-
nity," added Councilmember Ste-
phen Kunselman (D-Ward 3). "I
see this opportunity as minimiz-
ing the opportunity for something
bad to happen."
The measure eventually passed
Council with Briere, Eaton and
Councilmember Sumi Kailasapa-
thy (D-Ward 1) opposing.

Eradicating
More awareness needs to be directed toward diverse demographics
ashtenaw County recently reported a total of 33 new
HIV cases for 2013, increasing reported cases by
37 percent since 2012. With seven more cases than
2012, Washtenaw County experienced the largest number of new
infections since 1999. Similar to historical statistics, men who have
sex with men, or MSM, still comprise the majority of new infections
at 80 percent in the county. However, the number of new cases
among young adults and African Americans MSM are rising rapidly.
In order to decrease the number of new infections, the county, state
and national governments must work to emphasis the severity of the
disease to younger and more racially diverse audiences.

f you've turned on the computer
in the past couple days, chances
are that you've come across talk
or maybe even

Williams, Jamie Anderson and
Michael Phelps. And while others

gross publicity stunt, and complained
of their indecency, I would like to
applaud the message ESPN has sent.
While I definitely

I really appreciate
his and ESPN's sayingE
willingness to ignore deserv
American beauty y
standards. And their1
that's exactly why he
belongs on the pages
of a major magazine
- not in spite of his weight, but
because of it.
The outrage over Prince's
photographs shows the degree to
which big media has institutionalized
thinner beauty standards, and
gradually prompted American
readers to accept them. While
the naked photos of traditionally
attractive celebrathletes were
celebrated for depicting strength and
discipline, Prince's was written off as
inappropriate. Why?
As a culture we've moved from
appreciating function, to appreciating
aesthetics. The body of an incredible
athlete is worth less than if it were
more attractive, regardless of the
power capability of either. For some,
it can be extended to other objects as
well. Food is better if it looks better
in an Instagram post, not if it delivers
the best nutrients. Clothes are judged
on their style and brand name, not
their quality. Which is fine - we're
entitled to our own preferences. But
this superficiality shouldn't be applied
to everything. Especially people.
The best thing about the placement
of Prince in the magazine is that it
can help us move away from those
hurtful judgments. Exposure breeds
acceptance, and printing and posting

these images is an excellent first step
in correcting media bias. But, more
importantly, it's just more normal.
More American bodies resemble
Prince's than any of the other athletes
pictured. And while theirs should
be celebrated too, it's important to
recognize that perfection isn't the
standard. Another great addition to
the ESPN's series is paraolymipan
Amy Purdy, and the general diversity
in sport, race, gender and ability is
also awesome to see.
But while the pictures of Prince are
wonderful, I can't help but wonder if
it points to another double standard
in sports. Would the pictures have
been used if the heavier athlete were
female? I kind of doubt it. While
American culture is exceptionally,
aesthetically focused for both genders,
it's less so for males. In business,
sports, music and other arenas, the
focus seems more
on performance
than on beauty.

American athlete
in that sport. Very
few articles will
focus on his physique, or cast him
into the "sex symbol" role. Now do
the same for Lindsay Vonn, a female
of similar status in the sport. So
many more are about her dateability,
past relationships and body. Both
are attractive, yet Ligety is mostly
photographed in action or by the
podium, while several, if not most,
of Vonn show her in a bikini and
on the red carpet. Fair? Not really.
Women lose out on the opportunity
to be appreciated for their talent and
dedication for their sport. They don't
train year-round just to be sex icons,
but rather to be the best in their sport
- just the same as the men do.
So I didn't mean to make this
positive addition of naked Prince into
a negative, but its implications are
clear and important. We can't give
acceptance a gender. For a while, the
trends were for both genders to face
body scrutiny. That trend is dangerous
and unacceptable, and it goes without
saying that everyone deserves to
love their bodies. It's time that we
throw that trend in reverse, and it's
refreshing to see ESPN doing so - but
improvement isn't just for the guys.

Fresh 'Obvious Child'

Washtenaw County's
increase in positive cases
mirrors trends in Southeast
Michigan and the United States
as a whole. While a 37-percent
increase in cases in Washtenaw
County is dangerous by itself,
the spike also has the potential
to set a deadly precedent
within the next few years.
Since people contract HIV
through other humans, having
more uneducated or unaware
citizens causes a harmful
domino effect.
When HIV was first
discovered in 1981, several
grassroots organizations -
and eventually the federal
government - began
movements to educate
the public and raise
awareness about the disease.
Unfortunately, with the
continued development and
effectiveness of antiretroviral
drugs used to combat HIV,

awareness and education
towards the youth has tapered
off. Given the disconnect
between the severity of the
disease witnessed when it
was first discovered and the
demographics of recently
transmitted cases, creating
a new campaign targeted at
younger and more diverse
audiences is a necessary step
in decreasing the number of
newly infected patients.
The predominant way to
stop this hazardous cycle is
through raising awareness
and educating others on HIV
prevention. This task, however,
proves difficultgiventeenagers
and young adult's disaffiliation
with the HIV/AIDS movement.
About one-third of new HIV
cases in Washtenaw County
are those between the ages of
15 and 24. Similarly, in 2013,
the Center for Disease Control
reported that young, Black

MSM is the demographic most
seriously affected by the HIV/
AIDs epidemic with 55 percent
of all new infections among
young MSM.
I A higher number of youth
and minority race infections
disproves the notion that
HIV is a disease of the past.
However, those under 30 often
believe that contracting HIV
isn't a realistic possibility. This
incorrect perception likely
contributes to the infection
spike with those under 30.
Millennials must receive
comprehensive and resilient
education about effective
methods for preventing HIV
infection and the detrimental
effects it has on its victims.
By heavily engaging youth,
minority races, MSM and
other severely affected
demographics, we can work
toward eradicating HIV from
the nation's population.

several key scenes. Several comedi-

If I had to find one criticism with

white knight. The film tries to coun-

tendency to always have the right

his character from feeling far less

Since I was little, my dad
warned me of three "dangerous"
conversation topics that inevitably
lead to arguments: money, religion
and politics. My status as a broke
college student usually saves me
from offending anyone within the
first topic. However, the following
two subjects continually find pesky
ways of intertwining and infringing
upon human rights. Religion and
politics provide us with societal
frameworks. These very, separate
spheres of thought and belief
encourage humanity to flourish, to
foster goodwill towards one another,
to seek peace and to provide guidance
amidst the towering specter of
uncertainty. Yet, when these vastly
different and complicated worlds of
subjectivity collide, we, as citizens
dismantle and scatter into our
respective corners like billiards balls
at the start of a game.
When religion and politics are
muddled together, the shouting
match commences and we begin
to disregard the impact our beliefs
hold over the rights of our fellow
citizens. For example, an offensive
- well, in my opinion - float
appeared in my hometown's Fourth
of July parade. It was merely a
pickup truck with a trailer scuttling
behind it; the float's message was a
crudely sprayed equation upon the
trailer's side. In black spray paint,
the message read: "God's marriage=
1 man + 1 woman. Honk ifyou agree."
I most certainly wasn't about
to honk. The only reaction the
supposedly "correct" equation
incited was a fervent desire to
display a particular finger to the
elderly, scruffy "mountain man"
sitting in the trailer. However,
the presence of children and the
realization my reaction would
encroach upon the freedom of
speech of these individuals stopped
me. Even if I didn't agree with
the message or if I believe it was
displayed at the wrong place and
time, the parade was open to all
forms of speech. Yet, I possessed
a sneaking suspicion if a pro-
marriage equality float appeared,
its creators would be accused of
shoving their beliefs down the
townspeople's throats.
While the parade incident was
a minor example, last week the
infiltration of religion upon politics
led the Supreme Court to disregard
the rights of thousands of female
workers. In a close 5-4 ruling
last Monday, the Supreme Court

justices ruled in favor of owners of
the Hobby Lobby retail chain in a
dispute regardingthe responsibility
to cover contraception in the
insurance offered to their
employees. The Christian families
who own Hobby Lobby and
Conestoga Wood Specialties
challenged a provision of the
Affordable Care Act requiringthem
to offer contraception coverage.
Under the grounds of protecting
their religious freedom, the owners
argued offering insurance coverage
for contraception forced them to
endorse abortion.
The Affordable Care Act provides
exemptions to religious institutions,
hospitals and schools, but for-profit
companies, like Hobby Lobby,
were originally expected to cover
contraception in employee health
care plans. Now, because Hobby
Lobby is considered a privately-
held company - or a company
with the majority of shares owned
by five or less people - they're
no longer required to cover birth
control methods such as Plan B or
intrauterine devices. Prices for birth
control methods like IUDs can range
up to $1,000, and now the entirety of
these costs must come directly out of
female workers' pockets.
Although the company may only
be owned by a small number of
Christiansthe numerous individuals
employed bythe company most likely
come from a diverse array of creeds
and shouldn't have their employers'
beliefs imposed upon them. The
women requesting contraception
coverage may not even wish to
prevent pregnancy. According to a
study by the Guttmacher Institute,
1.5 million women use birth control
aid in the treatment of ovarian
cancer, ovarian cysts, endometriosis
and endometrial cancer. Likewise,
Guttmacher also found 58 percent
of birth control users utilize these
methods to reduce menstrual pain,
prevent migraines and treat acne.
Like many other treatments and
prescriptions, birth control can be a
costly medical necessity.
A decision of women's health rests
exclusively with the woman affected
by it and the beliefs she follows. I find
it preposterous an issue of women's
health was decided by five men, the
justices who comprised the majority
decision, and will continually be
decided by religiously motivated
employers.

Among these schools is Pennsyl-
vania State University in University
Park, Pennsylvania. Penn State, like
Michigan, received nation-wide
scrutiny on its administration's
response to sexual assault following
allegations of sexual abuse by former
assistant coach Jerry Sandusky.
Although Penn State had the high-
est number of reported instances of
sexual assault from 2010 to 2012, it
also had the greatest rise of reported
allegations in that time frame, from
4 reported assaults in 2010 to 56 in
2012.
Penn State has recently imple-
mented several programs to aid stu-
dents, faculty and staff in responding
to and preventingsexual misconduct.
These include self-defense courses,
mass educational initiatives, open
campus discussions and changes to
police protocol.
LisaPowers, director ofthe Office
of Strategic Communications at Penn
State, said the university takes the
issue of sexual violence on campus
very seriously and encourages open,
national discussion on the issue. She
added that she believes high rates of
reported assault reflect victim com-
fort with coming forward.
"We certainly believe training is
effective, and we know that if more
people are aware they are gener-
ally more likelyto come forward and
report,"she said."That's agood thing,

since we know this is a crime that is
vastlyunder-reported."
Lisa Lapin, associate vice presi-
dent of University Communications
at Stanford University, which had
the fifth highest number of reported
sexual offenses in 2012, echoed simi-
lar attitudes toward reported assault.
"We consider the numbers actu-
ally a success, because underreport-
ingisachronicprobleminallcolleges
and universities," she said. "We look
at the increase in our numbers to
mean that our outreach programs
are working and we're helpingpeople
get access to the resources that they
need."
On the other end of the spectrum,
Johns Hopkins University, which
only had 6 total reported instances
of sexual assault from 2010 to 2012,
started takingsteps to improve their
sexual misconduct policy following
the Department of Education's man-
date clarifyinguniversity's active role
in investigating allegations of sexual
assault under Title IX, though the
school isn't currently under investi-
gation.
Dennis O'Shea, executive director
of Media Relations and Crisis Com-
munications at Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, said the university revised
their sexual violence policy in
December 2012. It has created a 24/7
crisis hotline for survivors of sexual
assault to feel comfortable reporting

attacks and hired a sexual violence
prevention, education and response
coordinator. They are working to
reword their policy to make it more
understandable to students.
Though O'Shea did not wish to
comment on the low number of
reported assaults, he said the school
is in the process of forming a Sexual
Violence Advisory Committee with
students, faculty and staff to help
the school address prevention and
response.
"We're in no way complacent," he
said. "There is more to do and we are
determined to do it. We will live up
to the standards we have set for our-
selves."
Though university spokespeople
andfederalresearchers believegreat-
er numbers of reported instances of
assault is an improvement, it is still
only part of the problem in combat-
ing occurring sexual assault across
campuses.
For the University, Rider-Milkov-
ich said it will take continuous, vig-
orous and community-wide effort
to end instances of sexual assault on
campus, both reported and not.
"We're looking at the long hori-
zon here," she said. "Anytime you're
talking about shifting culture, you're
looking at a long horizon, but I think
that Michigan has the infrastructure,
the commitment, the expertise and
the willto makethathappen."

TRANSIT
From Page 1
with Disabilities Act
Some of the environmentally-
friendly features of the building
include the use of storm water
collected from the roof in public
restrooms, heated driveways and
sidewalks to decrease snow-salt
usage and the reuse of materials
from the former transit building in
the new facility.
Contractors and manag-
ers of the center also partnered
with small Ann Arbor-based
and Detroit-based businesses in
excavating and facilitating the
building. Managers chose these
companies under the guidelines of
federal programs devoted to fos-
tering growth in local economies
and helping minority individuals
and women run businesses. The
center received $7 million in fed-
eral funds towards the renovation
project.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.)
spoke at the event on the impor-
tance of mass transit to help move
communities forward. He said
though he loved to see American
automobiles on the road, mass
transit is critical in helping those
that can't afford their own vehicle.

Dingell also congratulated the
Ann Arbor community for its
achievement, and noted that this is
one step of many to improve qual-
ity of life in the city.
Quoting Churchill, he said, "It is
not the beginning of the end, it is
perhaps the end of the beginning.
More needs to be done and has to
be done quickly."
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje echoed Dingell's observations,
speaking on the affordability of
public transit for citizens. He also
brought up the federal funds the
AAATA received to build a new
train station in Ann Arbor.
"I think that this is one of the
best things that we can do for our
city in the future, it helps every-
one, it lifts all boats," Hieftje said.
Larry Krieg, Ypsilanti repre-
sentative on the AAATA's board
of directors, was in attendance at
the event. He said he was excited
to see the center transform into a
social gathering site over the next
few years and was proud of the
eco-friendly and user-friendly fea-
tures of the building.
"The whole thing is so accessible
to mobility challenges, that's avery
important thing," Krieg said. "Peo-
ple say that ifa system, a building
or a transportation system, works
well for disabled people, it'll work
better for everyone else."

'U' ranks second in total number of reported sexual assaults

More survivors
coming forward first
step in changing
campus culture
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily NewsEditor
According to a recent analysis
done by the Washington Post on
data from the U.S. Department of
Education, the University of Michi-
gan had 34 total reported instances
of sexual assault last year - the sec-
ond highest number in the nation.
The University had 64 total
recorded instances of sexual assault
on campus from 2010 - 2012. There
were 0.78 reported offenses per
1,000 students in 2012.
Of the nearly 1,570 colleges and
universities listed, Pennsylvania
State University had the highest
number of reported sexual assaults
with 56 in 2012. Harvard ranked
third, behind the University, with
31.
In contrast, 45 percent of univer-
sities with enrollment of 1,000 or
higher had 0 reported instances of
sexual assault last year.
Overthe pastyear,theUniversity
has been no stranger to scrutiny by
both outside law enforcement and
students over its handling of sexual

assault allegations.
The Michigan Daily reported
in January the permanent separa-
tion of Brendan Gibbons, a kicker
for the University's football team,
from the University for sexual mis-
conduct. Following a complaint
filed by former University professor
Doug Smith, the U.S. Department
of Education Office for Civil Rights
opened an investigation on the Uni-
versity's handling ofthe separation.
Central Student Government also
commissioned atask force to review
the circumstances surrounding the
separation. The task force found the
University responsible for mishan-
dling Gibbons' sexual misconduct
case after two months of scrutiny.
Though high reporting rates,
coupled with the allegations sur-
rounding Gibbons' separation could
create an unfavorable perception of
the University, Holly Rider-Milkov-
ich, director of the Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Center,
said she believes the rates are likely
not different from other universi-
ties nationally. What's different,
she said, is the atmosphere around
reporting incidents when they hap-
pen, making high reporting rates
more of a positive than anegative.
"When I see those high report-
ingrates, Ithinktomyselfthat's one
more student who has felt comfort-
able in sharing the feeling of harm
and has connected to the spectrum

of resources," she said. "I am proud
of the reporting rate that we have
achieved."
RecentchangestoUniversity
sexual misconduct policy
In January 2014, the White
House Council on Women and Girls
published a sexual assault report
entitled "Rape and SexualAssault:A
Renewed Call to Action" that stated
nearlyl in5 women have been sexu-
ally assaulted while in college and
7 percent of college men admitted
to committing rape or attempting
rape. The data reveals that only 12
percent of student survivors report
the assault to law enforcement.
To combat these statistics and
others on sexual assault on campus-
es, the University began a30-month
long study on campus climate
regarding sexual assault and new
methods to prevent and respond
to it for the purpose of revising the
sexual misconduct policy at the
University. The policy sets the Uni-
versity's procedures for responding
to sexual assault cases and issues on
campus.
During an initial interim stage
beginning in 2011, the directors of
office of Student Conflict Reso-
lution, the Office of Institutional
Equity, SAPAC and a staff member
in the Office of the General Counsel
gathered to review data and brain-

storm new initiatives. Survivors of
sexual assault and others impacted
by the previous policy were also
consulted.
Rider-Milkovich said the new
policy respects the values and
expectations of University staff,
students and faculty.
"Unlike many campuses, the
University of Michigan's policies
are unique to our needs and it's
unique to what we value," she said.
"It's not an off the shelf product."
The new University policy
encourages any and all reporting
of sexual misconduct, and gives
faculty and administration a great-
er responsibility in investigating
assault allegations. Two full-time
investigators also work regularly on
analyzing and studying sexual mis-
conduct cases.
Since the implementation of the
interim policy in 2011, the Univer-
sity has seen far greater reported
instances of sexual assault - the
number of reports in 2012 is more
than double thatof2010.
SAPAC student director Kathryn
Abercrombie attributed the spike
of reported incidences to the policy
change.
"We've seen the number of
reports rise because there has been
a different reporting process that
make it easier for survivors tocome
forward," Abercrombie said.
LSA senior Katelyn Maddock

agreed. She lauded the University's
system of supporting sexual mis-
conduct survivors and giving them
the confidence to report crime.
"High reporting doesn't really
reflect that we have a problem,"
Maddock said. "I think it does
reflect that people are coming for-
ward. We have a really good system
in place."
Reporting sexual assault
across U.S.universities
In light of the White House
report, the Obama administration
created a task force to combat cam-
pus sexual assault as well as nation-
wide sexual violence.
"To make our campuses safer,
change still needs to come from
many quarters: schools must adopt
better policies and practices to
prevent these crimes and to more
effectively respond when they hap-
pen,"the reportstated. "And federal
agencies must ensure that schools
are livingup totheir obligations."
Federal law agencies took action
again last May when the U.S.
Department of Education's Office
for Civil Rights opened an investi-
gation on over 60 universities for
possible violation of Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972
which prohibits gender-based dis-
crimination in federally funded
programs and organizations.

ing, but we didn't think that
was the proper fit and wanted to
do the leasing correctly," he said.
"We tried to select a good vari-
ety of retailers and restaurants."
"Sweetwaters is a wonder-
ful tenant and a great addition
to the building," he said. "They
are local, they have a great brand
and a great image."
Sheila Li and her husband Roy
Xu, owners of the new Sweetwa-
ters cafe, said they were happy
to be able to share more of the
Sweetwaters experience with
Ann Arbor customers.
"It has been very exciting to
have the grand opening and to
see customers come in and enjoy
the atmosphere and the design of
the store," Li said. "We already
have a steady customer base,
since Sweetwaters have been in
Ann Arbor for over 21 years."
Li also highlighted several
unique sustainable designs of
the store, including LED light-
ing, an energy-saving instant
water heater, motion sensors for
lighting control and a self-suf-

ficient green wall that features
live plants, as features she was
particularly proud of.
The cafe will be the first cof-
feehouse to be certified LEED by
the U.S. Green Building Coun-
cil, she said. LEED certification
indicates that a business has met
certain construction and build-
ing prerequisites that reduce the
impact they have on the environ-
ment.
Sweetwaters founder Lisa Bee
said they are thrilled to be in the
East Liberty space. The energy
level and the business at the new
cafe have been great and it's get-
ting busier every day, she added.
"We have a lot of students
who are customers," she said. "I
really think students are going
to make the cafe their own and
we'll adopt to their taste."
Slurping Turtle Sous Chef
Juan-Paulo Garcia said his res-
taurant, which neighbors Sweet-
waters, has been successful since
its April 21 opening and the loca-
tion has exceeded their initial
expectations.
"Sweetwaters will be a great
addition and will definitely bring
a lot of foot traffic to the area,"
he said.
