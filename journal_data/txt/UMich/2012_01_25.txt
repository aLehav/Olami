President Obama
lauds importance of
college affordability
By KATIE BURKE
Daily Staff Reporter
In his annual State of the Union
address last night, President Barack
Obama highlighted the necessity of
economic and educational reform
along with Congressional coop-
eration as the country continues its
economic recovery.
Obama emphasized the impor-
tance of creating more jobs, holding
a higher standard of accountability
for Wall Street and Washington,
increasing accessibility to higher
education and continuing efforts
for peace in the Middle East, all by
creating an "America built to last."
U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.) said in an interview with
The Michigan Daily after the
address that he felt the speech's
overall outlook was hopeful regard-
ing ongoing efforts toward national
recovery.
"It had an optimistic tone,"
Dingell said. "(Obama) talked about

making America better and he
pointed out the state of our union is
gettingstronger."
Job growth efforts have helped
spur the creation of three million
jobs in the past 22 months, Obama
said. The president added that its
necessary to prepare citizens for
new jobs through higher education
to successfully strengthening the
nation.
"To prepare for the jobs of
tomorrow, our commitment to
skills and education has to start
earlier," Obama said.
A major obstacle to this objec-
tive is the rising cost of higher edu-
cation, Obama said. He proposed
changes such as making additional
room in state budgets for financial
aid and encouraging colleges and
universities to keep their costs low
by using technology and allowing
students to graduate sooner.
"Higher education can't be alux-
ury -- it is an economic imperative
that every family in America should
be able to afford," Obama said.
Obama added having all stu-
dents graduate from high school
is imperative, and he encouraged
states to pass laws mandating that

Forum fosters
discussion on
transporation
improvements
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
In an effort to improve condi-
tions for bicyclists in Ann Arbor,
the Office of Campus Sustain-
ability and Parking and Trans-
portation Services sponsored a

town hall meeting at the Michi-
gan League last night to foster
discussion on transportation in
Ann Arbor.
Students, Ann Arbor citi-
zens and city and campus offi-
cials discussed the upcoming
implementation of a bike rent-
al system and brainstormed
the possible development of
increased bike lanes on city
streets, and the creation of addi-
tional areas for bicycle parking
on campus.
University Planner Susan
Gott said improving bicycle

parking conditions is an impor-
tant initiative for the Uni-
versity, particularly through
adding more parking stations
or advanced structures on cam-
pus.
"We are looking for the best
areas for the structures," Gott
said. "Would it be in our highest
use areas, for example around
the residential halls where we
have high volumes of students,
or by our transit centers..."
She added the University is
taking "competing interests
into consideration" in order to

create the most effective pro-
gram for students.
Steven Dolen, executive
director of Parking and Trans-
portation and panelist at the
forum, discussed how the
upcoming bike rental system
was developed largely as a
response to student need for
bike transportation on campus.
"The rental program. is our
first step in really showing our
commitment," Dolen said. "I
think it's a small step, but it is
something we can do quickly

The Student Assembly of the

support of medical amnesty and
tuition equality at last night's meet-
ing.
The tuition equality plan would
allow undocumented residents

Three-phase
program to be
completed by 2017
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily News Editor
With the help of a three-
phase cost containment
model, University officials
have devised a long-term plan
that will save the University
an estimated $355 million by
the end of fiscal year 2017.
Ongoing cost containment
efforts, which first began in
fiscal year 2003, have kept the
University financially sound
amid the difficult economic
climate in the state of Michi-
gan, said University Provost
Philip Hanlon in an interview
with The Michigan Daily.
"I think this kind of fiscal
discipline is one of the things
that separates us from the
other elite universities in this
very difficult period," Hanlon
said. "The University of Mich-
igan ... remained on a stable
upper trajectory through the
collapse of 2008, the financial
collapse ... because of the fiscal
discipline we introduced."
The first phase of the con-
tainment model - held dur-
ing fiscal years 2003 through
2009 - saved the University
approximately $135 million in
recurring costs by increasing
energy efficiency, changing

Sole Sisters, a boutique on East
Liberty Street, will be closing its
doors at the end of the month -
joining the growing list of busi-
nesses in the area that have ceased
operating in the past few months,

including Poshh, This and That, @
Burger and Borders.
According to local business
owners and Tim Faley, manag-
ing director of the Institute for
Entrepreneurial Studies in the
Ross School of Business, the rise
in store closures in the area could
be related to a variety of factors,
including the closure of Borders in
September and increased competi-
tion from upscale restaurants that
have began to flourish in the area.

health care benefit strategies
and increasing productivity of
staff members:
Currently, the University
is in phase two of the model,
which will be completed by
the end of the current fiscal
year and is expected to save
the University an additional
$100 million.
Phase three, projected to

save an additional $120 mil-
lion, will commence at the
beginning of fiscal year 2013
and end in fiscal year 2017.
The entire model will result in
a total savings of about $23.7
million per year by the end of
fiscal year 2017.
Hanlon said long-term plan-
ning for savings is what makes
the plan successful.

"The winner for us is the
fact that we have this annual
effort, this annual commit-
ment to cut between 1.5 to 2.25
percent out of our budget,"
Hanlon said. "We know that
we need to do that in 2013 to
2017, so we're already putting
in place the programs which
may take a long time to devel-

A family affair

Though the University offers
35 club sports, the University
Taekwondo Club prides itself as
serving an outlet for students to
make connections, strengthen
their skills and experience a
smaller tight-knit community
within the larger student body.
Engineering senior Jorge
Pena, a member of the club, said
he practices at least three days
each week. He joined the club
as a junior transfer student, but
has been practicing taekwondo
for 19 years, and he was chosen
as the University's 2010-2011
Club Sports Outstanding Male
Athlete.
Pena assists coaches Naji
Husseinia nd Jacque Husseini,

a husband and wife duo, during
practices. Pena said the Hus-
seinis' relationship helps tie the
club together and makes it feel
more like a family.
"When I first'got here, and I
first started meeting the coach-
es Naji and Jacque, I noticed
(that) there was something dif-
ferent in this club," he said. " ...
You can really feel more like a
family. They were like the mom
and dad...of the entire club."
The club has received mul-
tiple first-place titles in division
championships, during its sea-
son, and Pena attributes the suc-
cess of the club and its members
to the hard work and dedication
of the coaches.

"(The Husseinis) have
stepped in to the club, to take
the lead," Pena said. " ... They
run the classes, they run the
trainings. Ihave never seen that
much passion about taekwondo.
They have so much love for this
sport."
Pena said he is excited to
bring attention to the club and
to acknowledge the work of the
group's officers and coaches.
"That's one of the reasons
why I want to make a name for
the taekwondo club," he said.
"To promote it and (show) what
we have done...(and) to give
some recognition to them."

Russian opposition leader
F"; 'rrbarred from election process

Candidate for
president was critic
of Vladimir Putin
MOSCOW (AP) - Russia's
elections commission said yes-
terday a prominent opposition
leader will be disqualified from
running for president in March,
a move that would prevent his
party from fielding observers.
Russian news agencies quoted
elections commission secretary
Nikolai Konkin as saying yester-
day that the body would formally
block Grigory Yavlinsky from the
ballot later this week, after find-
ing that hundreds of thousands
of the signatures submitted on
his nominating petition were
invalid. .
Yavlinsky is leader of the lib-
eral Yabloko party and a critic of
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin,

who is seeking a return to the.
presidency in the March 4 elec-
tion.
The election commission
already has registered Putin and
three other contenders: Commu-
nist Party chief Gennady Zyu-
ganov, ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky and socialist Just
Russia leader Sergei Mironov.
Since their partjes are represent-
ed in the parliament, their reg-
istration is easier than for other
potential candidates.
The rejection of Yavlinsky's
candidacy, however, is likely
to sharpen political tensions
that have been strong since last
month's unprecedented massive
protests sparked by alleged fraud
in parliamentary elections.
Although Yavlinsky has not
been a key figure of those pro-
tests, his party fielded thou-
sands of election observers in
the December election who

documented evidence of fraud
in favor of Putin's United Russia
party.
On Monday, Yavlinsky said
authorities wanted to prevent
him from running in order to
block genuine competition. He
says other candidates are only
nominal rivals and are following
Kremlin guidance.
Yabloko has not had any seats
in the parliament since 2007.
Politicians who want to run for
president but whose parties are
not in parliament must submit 2
million signatures in support of
their candidacy.
Konkin said that examinations
of about 600,000 of the signa-
tures-submitted to support Yav-
linsky's nomination found some
25 percent of them to be invalid,
largely because the signatures
were photocopied. That is higher
than the 5-percent rejection level
allowed by law.

Forwer Massachusetts Guv. Mitt Romney, right, smiles during a Repsblican presidential debate an Jan. 23.
Ro-mney addresses housing,
banks fr Florida GOP primary

Candidate humanizes
Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac
LEHIGH ACRES, Fla. (AP)
- Republican presidential can-
didate Mitt Romney came to
ground zero of the housing cri-
sis yesterday to assail rival Newt
Gingrich over his ties to the gov-
ernment-backed mortgage com-
panies that helped make it worse,
a message Romney has been
pushing since he landed in the
state. But that meant he also had
to talk about banks - and he con-
tinued what's become a habit of
comparing companies to people.
Romney was standing outside
a Fannie Mae-foreclosed home in
a struggling neighborhood tell-
ing a small crowd why they're
having so much trouble. "In this
case, it's because of the banks,"
he explained. "Well, the banks
aren't bad people: They're just
overwhelmed right now."
During a Monday roundtable
with business owners struggling
in Florida's hobbled housing
market, the former Massachu-
setts governor told the group that
their troubles with banks came
because the lenders were worried
about staying in business.
"The banks are scared to death,

of course," he said. "They're feel-
ing the same thing that you're
feeling. And 'so they just want to
pretend that all this is just going
to get paid some day."
Both comments echoed the
now-famous line Romney deliv-
ered from a hay bale at the Iowa
state fair: "Corporations are peo-
ple, my friend!"
They're also part of a string
of comments Romney has made
that his opponents have used to
pummel him as wealthy and out
of touch with average Americans.
Ahead of the New Hampshire
primary, he said he once feared
being "pink-slipped" and later
said "I like to fire people." He was
referring to insurance compa-
nies, but both Democrats and his
Republican rivals attacked him
for it.
In calling corporations people,
Romney meant that the money
companies make benefits indi-
viduals and ultimately employs
people and creates jobs. And
in Florida, he's been trying to
explain that banks are scared
they'll go out of business because
so many people have stopped
paying their mortgages. He's also
argued that regulations passed
during the Obama administra-
tion give banks less flexibility if
they're trying to help consum-
ers renegotiate the terms of their

mortgages.
He's focusing on the hous-
ing market because it's a critical
issue in Florida, where the GOP
primary will be held on Jan. 31.
Gingrich, his chief rival, earned
more than $1.6 million working
as a consultant to Freddie Mac.
The mortgage giant was heavily
involved in the subprime lending
business that helped drive the
housing bubble.
"Housing has become a mess
in large measure because the
government got in the middle of
it," Romney said. "I'm running
against a guy, as you know, in
this primary, who was out there
working for one of those guys in
the case of Freddie Mac."
Freddie Mac, a government-
sponsored enterprise, was origi-
nally designed to help more
people get access to mortgages to
buy homes.
Romney himself hasn't out-
lined any specific proposals to
help fix the housing market. He
says improving the economy will
allow Americans to regain their
footing and keep their homes.
Since coming to Florida,
though, he's softened his rhetoric.
Last year, he told the Las Vegas
Review-Journal that the govern-
ment should let the foreclosure
crisis "run its course and hit the
bottom."

U.S. flexes military muscle in bid
to deter Iranian aggression in Gulf

NATO allies respond
to threats to close
vital strait
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Mili-
tary power near the strategic
Strait of Hormuz could be bol-
stered by additional .British
forces, the country's defense sec-
retary said yesterday, as a defiant
Iran shrugged off Europe's oil
embargo and moved ahead with
plans to hold naval exercises
alongside the oil tanker shipping
lanes it has threatened to block.
Tehran's bravado was in sharp
contrast to the widening interna-
tional pressures seeking to curb
its nuclear program.
Australia became the latest
country to shun Iranian oil, and
the European Union's foreign
policy chief traveled to Israel
for talks certain to convey the

West's belief that increasing eco-
nomic isolation, rather than a
push toward military action, is
the most effective tool against
Iran's leadership.
Iran also has accused Israel of
masterminding a series of covert
attacks such as a malicious com-
puter virus designed to infiltrate
uranium enrichment labs and
targeted slayings of members of
Iran's scientific community. Isra-
el has made no direct comments
on the claims, but dangled hints
that clandestine operations are
possible by Iran's many foes.
The EU on Monday joined
Washington in backing sanctions
targeting Iran's vital oil industry,
which accounts for about 80 per-
cent of its foreign currency reve-
nues. The vote in Brussels came a
day after a Western flotilla - two
British-and French warships and
the American aircraft carrier
USS Abraham Lincoln's battle

group - entered the Gulf in a
show of force against any Iranian
attempts to disrupt the route for
one-fifth of the world's oil.
Iran's commanders, mean-
while, are preparing their own
message. Plans remain in place
for the powerful Revolutionary
Guard to send its maritime forc-
es for maneuvers next month in
the Strait, which is jointly con-
trolled by Iran and, Oman and
has become the latest flashpoint
for a potential military confron-
tation.
"Elements within the Euro-
pean Union, by pursuing the
policies of the U.S. and adopting
a hostile approach, are seekingto
create tensions with the Islamic
Republic of Iran," the official
Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted Ali Asghar Khaji, a senior
foreign ministry official, as say-
ing. He called the EU decision
"irrational."

Kennedy's hearse
sells at auction
The man who paid $176,000 for
the white hearse used to transport
President John F. Kennedy's body
following his assassination in Dal-
las plans to include it in his collec-
tion of about 400 cars in Colorado.
Stephen Tebo, a collector and
real estate developer from Boul-
der, bought the hearse Saturday
that was being offered by Barrett-
Jackson Auction Co. of Scottsdale,
Ariz. It sold for a bid of $160,000,
plus a $16,000 buyer's premium.
The 1964 Cadillac hearse car-
ried Kennedy's body as well as
first lady Jacqueline Kennedy
from Parkland Memorial Hospital
to Air Force One at Dallas' Love
Field for the flight back to Wash-
ington on Nov. 22,1963, according
to the auction company.
"It was a solemn duty that it
had taking him from the hospital
where he was pronounced dead to
Air Force One," said Craig Jack-
son, CEO and chairman of the auc-
tion company. "I think everybody
in the world remembers watch-
ing the hearse leave the hospital,
heading toward Air Force One. It
just sort of sunk into everybody
that he's gone."
CAIRO
* Army relaxes
emergency laws
Egypt's military ruler yester-
day decreed a partial lifting of the
nation's hated emergency laws, an
apparent attempt to ease criticism
of his policies ahead of the first
anniversary of the'popular upris-
ing that toppled Hosni Mubarak.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi
said in a televised address that
the draconian laws, in force for
more than three decades, woultI
be lifted effective today but would
remain applicable to crimes com-
mitted by "thugs." The military
has often labeled organizers of
anti-government demonstrations
"thugs."
Tantawi's decision to partially
lift the emergency laws, which

give police far-reaching powers,
would likely not satisfy rights
groups that have been campaign-
ing for their total removal.

Even experienced stargazers
were stunned by the intensity
of the aurora borealis that swept
across the night sky in northern
Scandinavia after the biggest
solar flare in six years.
"It has been absolutely incred-
ible," British astronomer John
Mason cried from the deck of
the MS Midnatsol, a cruise ship
plying the fjord-fringed coast of
northern Norway.
"I saw my first aurora 40
years ago, and this is one of the
best," Mason told The Associat-
ed Press, his voice nearly drown-
ing in the cheers of awe-struck

fellow passengers.
U.S. space weather experts
from-the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration
said. yesterday evening that so
far they had heard of no prob-
lems from the storm that trig-
gered the auroras, which made it
as far south as Wales, where the
weather often doesn't cooperate
with good viewing.
It was part of the strongest
solar storm in years, but the sun
is likelyto get even more active in
the next few months and years,
said physicist Doug Biesecker at
the U.S. Space Weather Predic-
tion Center in Boulder, Colorado.
"To me this was a wake up call.
The sun is remindingus that solar
max is approaching," Biesecker
said. "A lot worse is in store for us.
We hope that you guys are paying
attention. I would say we passed
with flying colors."
Even before particles from
the solar storm reached the
Earth on Tuesday, a different
aurora Monday night was danc-

ing across the sky as far south
as Ireland and England, where
people rarely get a chance to
catch the stunning light show.
Those northern lights were
likely just variations in normal
background solar wind, not the
solar storm that erupted Sunday,
Biesecker said.
Tuesday's colorful display
may not have moved that far
south, limiting its audience, but
those who got to see it got bril-
liance in the sky that had not
been around for years.
"It was the biggest northern
lights I've seen in the five-six
years that I've worked here,"
said Andreas Hermansson, a
tour guide at the Ice Hotel in the
Swedish town of Jukkasjarvi,
above the Arctic Circle.
He was leading a group of
tourists on a bus tour in the
area when a green glow that
had lingered in the sky for
much of the evening virtually
exploded into a spectacle of
colors around 10:15 p.m.

U.N. Security
Council could act
despite Russian
objections
BEIRUT (AP) - With Arab
pressure mounting to end 10
months of bloodshed, the Syr-
ian regime vowed yesterday to
solve its own problems even if
"half the universe" is conspir-
ing against it.
The remarks signaled that
Arab League efforts to stem the
violence are collapsing - some-
thing that could pave the way
for ,the U.N. Security Council
to step in, even though Russia is
firmly opposed to punitive mea-
sures against its longtime ally.
Syrian Foreign Minister
Walid al-Moallem brushed off
the threat of referring the issue
to the Security Council - a
move that could lead to tougher
sanctions - rather than try-
ing to resolve it regionally. The
prospect of U.N. involvement
has raised fears in Syria that
an international intervention
could be next.
"If they go to (U.N. head-
quarters in) New York or the
moon, as long as we don't pay
their tickets, this is their busi-
ness," al-Moallem said at a news
conference in Damascus.
He was reacting to an appeal
by the Gulf Cooperation Coun-
cil for the U.N. Security Council
to take all "necessary measures"
to force Syria to implement an
Arab League's ambitious peace
plan announced Sunday to cre-
ate a national unity government'
in two months. Damascus has
rejected the plan as a violation
of national sovereignty.

"The decision was made after
careful and thorough monitor-
ing of events in Syria and the
conviction by the GCC that the
bloodshed and the killing of
innocent people there is con-
tinuing," the statement by the
six-nation GCC said.
It also announced its six
member nations - Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman
and the United Arab Emirates -
were withdrawing the 52 moni-
tors they had contributed to an
Arab League observer mission
that has been heavily criticized
for failingto stop the crackdown
since it entered the country in
late December. That would leave
only about 110 observers on the
ground, League officials said,
a major blow to an effort that
many see as the only hope for a
regional solution to the crisis.
Several members of the
15-member council agreed yes-
terday that it was time for the
full group to take action.
"This council should fully
support the Arab League's
efforts to broker an end to the
bloodshed and a peaceful transi-
tion to democracy in Syria," U.S.
Ambassador Susan Rice said
during the council's monthly
debate on the Middle East.
British Ambassador to the
U.N. Mark Lyall Grantexpressed
concern about weapons prolifer-
ation via sales to the Syrian gov-
ernment or illegal smuggling to
the regime or opposition.
But the potential for U.N.
involvement is a highly charged
issue. Any resolution would
have to get past veto-wielding
Security Council members Rus-
sia and China, which already
rejected one Western-backed
draft that threatened an arms
embargo.


$214 million lures
Fielder to Tigers

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN

First baseman
agrees to nine-
year contract
DETROIT (AP) - The Detroit
Tigers responded to a jarring
injury with an audacious move.
Free-agent first baseman
Prince Fielder and the Tigers
agreed yesterdayto a nine-year,
$214 million contract that fills
,the AL Central champions'
need for a power hitter, a per-
son familiar with the deal said.
Detroit boldly stepped up in
the Fieldersweepstakes after the
recent knee injury to star Victor
Martinez. Aweekagothe Tigers
announcedthe productive desig-
nated hitter could miss the entire
season after tearing his left ACL
during offseason conditioning.
CBS first reported the agree-
ment with Fielder.
The person told The Associ-
ated Press the deal was subject
to a physical. The person spoke
on condition of anonymity
because the contract was not
yet complete.
The Tigers won their divi-
sion by 15 games before losing
in the AL championship series
to Texas. Adding the 27-year-
old Fielder gives the Tigers two
of the game's premier sluggers,
pairing him with Miguel Cabre-
ra.
With Fielder now in the
fold, general manager Dave
Dombrowski and owner Mike
Ilitch have a team that figures
to enter the 2012 season as a
favorite to repeat in the divi-
sion - with an eye on win-
ning the franchise's first World
Series title since 1984.
"Everyone" knew Mr. Ilitch
and Mr, Dombrowski were
going to make a move when
Victor went down," outfield-
er Brennan Boesch said in a
phone interview with the AP.
"But I don't think anybody
thought it would be this big."
The move also keeps Field-
ers name in the Tigers' family.
His father, Cecil, became a big
league star when be returned
to the majors from Japan and
hit 51 home runs with Detroit

in 1990. Cecil played with the
Tigers into the 1996 season, and
young Prince made a name for
himself by hitting prodigious
home runs in batting practice at
Tiger Stadium.
A few years ago, when Prince
returned to Detroit as a mem-
ber of the Milwaukee Brewers,
Tigers Hall of Famer Al Kaline
recalled that power show.
"You can't ever say that you
look at a kid that age and say that
you know he's going to hit 40
or 50 home runs someday, but
Prince was unbelievable," Kaline
said then. "Here's a 12-year-old
kid commonly hitting homers at
abigleague ballpark."
In an interview with MLB
Network Radio on SiriusXM,
Cecil Fielder said he was
"shocked" by the news that
Prince was heading to Detroit.
"He's been there in Detroit
most of his young life so I
think he'll be comfortable in
that place," Cecil Fielder said.
"I know Mr. Ilitch is probably
excited because he's been want-
ing that kid since he was a little
kid, so he finally got his wish."
With Cabrera and Fielder,
Detroit will begin this season
with two players under age 30
with at least 200 career homers.
According to STATS LLC, that's
happened only once before. At
the start of the 1961 season, the
Milwaukee Braves featured
29-year-old Eddie Mathews (338
homers) and "27-year-old Hank
Aaron (219).
Several teams had shown
interest this winter in Fielder,
who had spent his entire career
with the Brewers. He visited
Texas, and the Washington
Nationals also got involved in
the discussions.
The bdefy slugger hit .299
with 38 home runs and 120
RBIs last season. He is a three-
time All-Star and was the MVP
of last year's event in Phoenix.
Fielder has averaged 40 hom-
ers and 113 RBIs over the past
five years. He's also been among
the most durable players in the
majors, appearing in at least 157
games in each of the last six sea-
sons.

A little less conversation
Obama and Congress need to work together
ast night President Barack Obama gave a forward-looking
State of the Union address that offered many worthwhile pro-
posals in the face of major domestic issues, read: the economy.
While he addressed a wide range of topics, the president specifically
elaborated on issues relevant to students across the nation, including
access to education and a grim employment outlook for many college
graduates. In order to make his proposals a reality, however, Congress
must not continue their inefficient trends and stalling tactics, but
rather, work with all parts of government in creating a better future
for the United States.


That was the least funny milk-related thing since
'Milk.' #sotu"

"Crying over spilled milk" joke received few laughs during the State of the Union address.

The proposals put forth by Obama to
improve access to higher education were fair-
ly moderate, but were encouraging - a clear
improvement over the status quo. He called
on states to stop deftnding higher education
as a means of addressing budget crises, the
policies have a long-term impact of creat-
ing an ill-prepared workforce. The Univer-
sity has been significantly affected in recent
years by Lansing's massive funding cuts, and
tuition has risen at unprecedented levels in
response to decreased public funding. Michi-
gan's legislators must take Obama's message
to heart and work toward more affordable
higher education.
Several ideas Obama detailed are especial-
ly relevant to students, including doubling
the number of work-study jobs over the next
five years and extending federal tuition tax
credits. He expressed his desire for Congress
to stop interest rates on student loans from
"doubling" within the next six months. Final-
ly, he told colleges and universities that they
must work hard to stop tuition increases, or
risk losing public funds. Obama's proposals
would offer some relief to the countless stu-
dents struggling to pay for higher education
despite universities' focus on maximizing
endowment investments rather than increas-
ing accessibility to eager students.
As part of his plan to address unemploy-
ment, which has decreased during his ten-
ure, Obama called on Congress to take its
responsibility seriously in funding essen-

tial research and development projects.
High-tech research jobs have the potential
to become careers for many college gradu-
ates and concurrently deliver incalculable
benefits to society. Part of the president's
proposal to protect and expand private and
public research and development revolved
around a call to shift multi-billion dollar sub-
sidies from oil companies to the development
of clean energy projects, which would benefit
states like Michigan, where the advanced bat-
tery industry is, thriving and only has room
to grow. This proposal, in particular, would
serve dual purposes by creating jobs and
moving toward a more sustainable nation.
Although many of Obama's proposals were
a positive step forward, they can't be ana-
lyzed ina vacuum. When all is said and done,
the State of the Union is only a speech. A
year's worth of detailed plans can't be deliv-
ered in an hour-long address - especially one
interrupted by what seemed like 59 minutes
of clapping. It can't be ignored that over the
past three years the Obama administration
has fallen short of many of his fundamental
campaign goals, including promises to imple-
ment a public option for health care, closing
the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and ending
the Bush-era tax cuts. To assure that the pro-
posals put forward last night positively affect
students, and the entire country, Americans
must avoid becoming apolitical bystanders
expecting our government to benevolently
work in the public's interest.

socially awkward, especially with
historically subjugated populations.
However, the Republicans do some-
thing the penguin doesn't - they
mask the awkwardness through slo-
gans like "take our country back,"
which charges voters emotionally so
they don't have to vote logically.
Who do the conservatives want
to take the country back from and
what time do they wantto go back to?
Trust me, it's awkward.
For women, the GOP wants to take
the country back to pre-1960, before
women were reproductively liber-
ated by events like the FDA approval
of birth control pills. Former Repub-
lican presidential candidates Rick
Perry and Michele Bachmann and
current Republican presidential can-
didates Newt Gingrich and Rick San-
torum have all stated that abortion
should be banned, even in cases of
rape, incest or danger to the mother.
Almost the entire field of candidates
- the above group plus Mitt Romney
and former Republican presidential
candidate Jon Huntsman - wants to
cut federal funding for services like
Planned Parenthood and Women,
Infants and Children. So, let's get this
straight: All pregnancies - even pre-
carious ones - should be carried to
term. Then, the government should
further deprive the baby of needed
plantiing and sustenance. These guys
aren't pro-life, they're pro-birth and
apathetic about life.
But that's not all. U.S. Rep. Mike
Pence (R-Ind.) and some of his

enough to make decisions about their
bodies. Even the ostensibly small-
government supporter Ron Paul
has said that he wants Roe v. Wade
repealed. Why? So the government
can monitor every woman's uterus?
Women are now earning more col-
lege degrees than men. If anything,
maybe men - in male-dominated
politics - aren't smart enough.
For African-Americans, the GOP
wants to go back even further to the
early 1950s, before the Civil Rights
Movement. As election season heats
up, Republicans have been advocat-
ing for tighter voter identification
laws that require photo IDs in'several
states to help places like Wisconsin,
which Republican National Commit-
tee Chairman Reince Priebus says is
"riddled with voter fraud" as quoted
in a Dec. 2 ThinkProgress.org article.
However, a study at the Brennan
Center for Justice found that a scant
0.0002 percent of Wisconsin votes
were cast fraudulently during the
2004 elections.
Maybe you're thinking, "What's
wrong with improving election
integrity, and how's this relevant to
African-Americans?" First, the idea
that the GOP wants accurate elec-
tions is laughable - remember the
2000 presidential election when the
Republicans tried to stop the Florida
recount? Second, think about who
these laws affect most - the young,
the poor and African-Americans, all
Democrat-heavy voting blocs.
If voter fraud is not a signifi-

The good ol'days
weren't good
for everyone.

Examples of GOP social awkward-
ness are everywhere. At a time when
support for gay marriage is more
than 50 percent for the first time
according to Gallup, the Bachmanns
are still running "cure the gay" clin-
ics, and Santorum is comparing
homosexuality to "man-on-dog" bes-
tiality. Despite the progress Ameri-
cans have made in religious tolerance
post-9/ll, Gingrich is still saying that
Sharia law is a "mortal threat" to our
freedoms,, and former Republican
presidential candidate'Herman Cain
wouldn't consider appointing Mus-
lims in his administration.
"Take our country back" sounds
nice because it brings back memo-
ries of the "good ol' days," but the
GOP doesn't acknowledge that
those days weren't good for every-
one. Undoing the progress made
since that time would make Amer-
ica a laughingstock to the Western
world. But even worse than being
awkward, undoing social progress
would be devastating to many. Don't
be fooled by the slogan.

Engage in productive discourse

Watch out poison ivy, you've got some com-
petition. On Jan. 7, proud parents Beyoncd and
Jay-Z welcomed a joyful little cherub into the
world and named her Blue Ivy. No, this ridic-
ulous name isn't a joke. The couple forever
branded their child with a color and plantas her
identity. It could be worse, though. She could be
named Apple, Maddox, Suri or Seraphina - all
names of children who are blessed and cursed
with having world-renowned celebrities as
their parents. Why do celebrities think it's
okay to give their children such bizarre names?
Are they trying to make them feel special and
unique? These children are already destined to
have an off-beat and unusual upbringing, and
giving them strange names is only going to add
to the stresses of their lives.
I honestly think that celebrities use their
children's names as a competition. Let's play
"Who can give their child the most horren-
dous, embarrassing name?" They're using
their child's birth certificate in order to gait
fame and media coverage. If Beyonce had
named her child Mary, do you think anyone
would have cared? No. In true diva fashion,
she made sure that her child's name reflected
her career - flashy and showy.
I know what you're thinking: "How does a
celebrity naming their child something odd
affect me at all?" Step outside the box. Maybe
Tom Cruise naming his child Suri doesn't
personally affect you, but it certainly affects
society - though oftentimes this effect is
unconscious. The naming of a child was once
a beautiful, meaningful moment. Children
were named after their great-grandpa Tom,
who earned a medal of honor in World War
I. They received the name of their aunt Sue
who joined the nunnery and dedicated her life

to God. And now? Children are being named
after fruits, cars and plants. Once again, celeb-
rities have taken control of another aspect of
our lives.
Whether you realize it or not, their deci-
sion to give their children wacky names has
an influence on all of us. Every year, thou-
sands of people change their names. They're
"too boring" or "too plain." Since when are
Denim, Speck and Seven better names than
Robert, Joseph and Thomas? Celebrities
never fail to change and control society. We
seem to be their little puppets, eagerly await-
ing their next drastic move so we can attempt
to imitate it.
Celebrities give their children unusual
names because they can. It makes them feel
powerful and better than everyone else.
Celebrities are constantly in competition with
one another. They have to be the first to get
married, the first to have twins and the first to
name their child some ugly excuse for a name.
They crave attention and are willing to accept
it in any form - negative or positive. And we
the public? We drink it all up. We love the
hip, new, risky things celebrities do. We try
to be just like them. Sure, maybe you haven't
named your child Moses or Camera, but you
can't deny that as a child, you once longed to
change your name to match that of your favor-
ite celebrity.
Maybe our generation hasn't completely
fallen into the dreaded whirlwind of exotic
baby naming, but that doesn't mean the gener-
ation following us won't. All I'm saying is this:
don't be surprised if your grandson winds up
with the name Rocket or Jermajesty.

In the Dec. 11 viewpoint "It's time to talk about Pal-
estine," co-authors Bayan Founas and Noor Haydar use
inflammatory rhetoric and obscenely inaccurate myths
about the Middle East in order to propagate the idea that
Israelis are engaged in a systematic oppression of the
Palestinian people. While both sides in the Arab-Israeli
conflict are justifiably frustrated with the sluggish pace
of the peacemaking process over the past several years,
it's counterproductive and flat out dishonest to claim
that the Israeli government is racist and expellingIsraeli
Arabs from their homes. It is similarly troubling that
the co-authors and their organization, Students Allied
for Freedom and Equality seem to suggest that Israel is
somehow not rightfully entitled to enjoy the same rights
as any other sovereign nation when dealing with issues
of national security.
While it may seem admirable that SAFE "simply
believes in the self-determination of the Palestinian
people" and is committed to "promoting the rights of
Palestinian refugees to return to their homes," some
historical perspective can shed light on the underlying
goals of these initiatives. The 1947 United Nations par-
tition plan would have created two states side-by-side,
but the Palestinians rejected it. When Isreal declared
its independence, the Palestinians again were given an
opportunity to live peacefully within the new state with-
out leaving their homes. Some instead decided to vacate
their properties, relying on Israel's Arab neighbors'
promise to "drive the Jews into the sea." The 1978 Camp
David Accords also presented an opportunity for a last-
ing peace, which was again rejected by Palestinian lead-
ers. Back in 2000, President Bill Clinton hosted a round
of peace talks between the two camps again. In addition
to spurning yet another opportunity for peace, Palestin-
ian leadership afterword initiated the bloody Second
Intifada against Israeli civilians
More recently, the Palestinian-administered Gaza
Strip fell into the hands of Hamas - a terrorist organi-
zation steadfastly dedicated to the destruction of Israel
- by way of democratic elections. While both parties
desire a long-term peace, every Israeli effort to cede con-

trol and sovereignty to Palestinian leadership has been
met with hostility, escalated tensions and, in the cases of
the Intifada and Hamas, gutless and cowardly violence
targeted at defenseless Israeli civilians. Such radical tac-
tics are embraced by Palestinian leaders like Mahmoud
Abbas, who continually refuses to recognize Israel as a
Jewish state, and Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian Liberation
Organization's chief negotiator, who has suggested that
any future Palestinian state must expel all Jews from
within its borders.
SAFE claims that its only cause is to advocate for the
self-determination of the Palestinian people. They deny
any association with the PLO as well as Hamas and
Fatah, and decline to take a position on Palestinian state-
hood. Such a form of advocacy is dangerous, for uncon-
ditionally supporting the Palestinian people's right to
self-determination implicitly supports the institutions
and policy platforms of the very organizations the Pal-
estinians have chosen to lead. Dating back to Israel's
founding, history has demonstrated that Palestinian
decisions made under the guise of "self-determination"
have come at the expense of both public safety and long-
term peace in the region.
I take issue with SAFE's reasoning behind itswalk-out
demonstration during Israeli diplomat Ishmael Khaldi's
speech at the University last semester. Founas and Hay-
dar's contention that Khaldi should not have been per-
mitted to speak at the University runs counter to the very
idea ofliberty that they advocate for the Palestinian peo-
ple. Israel sent a diplomat to campus to give students an
opportunity to question, and contribute to, the dialogue
surrounding the negotiations in the Middle East. Given
the opportunity to participate and determine their role
in the peace process, SAFE chose to go for shock value
and engage in destructive dialogue, something that their
Palestinian counterparts have demonstrated time and
time again. Should we really be surprised?

Sole Sisters on East Liberty Street will close at the end of the month, according to owner Tamar Fowler.

Sisters, said the company expe-
rienced a decrease in sales over
the course of the past six to eight
months that has made continu-
ing business operations difficult.
Though she moved to East Lib-
erty from Fourth Avenue in 2010
in hopes of increased foot traffic,
ultimately she said the rent on
East Liberty was too high.
"It's heartbreaking, of
course," Fowler said. "You put
* so much time and effort into it ...
' it does hurt a little, but it's still
good because I've tried ... we
made it three and a half years. I
met some really great people; I
love my customers, I really got

them."
Sole Sisters, which opened
in March 2010, will hopefully
be revived in the future as she
explores methods of revivingher
business and new ways to sell
her shoes, handbags and jewelry,
Fowler said.
- Faley wrote in an e-mail
interview that in order for busi-
nesses to remain open, they must

costs paid to operate the store,

op."
In an interview with the Daily,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said a major reason for
implementing cost containment
plans was to combat against the
increasing likelihood of funding
cuts from the state than when
she first came to the .University
in 2002. Last year, the University
received $47.5 million less from
the state, and over the past 10
years, funding has decreased by
about 30 percent.
"It's just a good practice, being
as efficient as you possibly can
and making sure you're using
best practices," Coleman said.
"Certainly, the pressures from
the state and our desire to keep
tuition as low as we possibly can,
the increases in tuition as low
as we possibly can, have really
prompte d us to do some really far
reaching initiatives."
Coleman added that savings
have been implemented in areas
that will not negatively impact
academic standards.
"Through every single thing
that we've done, we've tried to
protect what happens in the
classroom," Coleman said. "We
want to make sure that we don't
cut (extracurricular) programs
back because we think they're
so important to the education of
students."
Coleman said the containment
plans have ultimately resulted in

end restaurants that serve liquor
to supplement food profits.
"While restaurants and retail
shops all operate on thin mar-
gins, the bottom line is that a
higher-end restaurant with a
liquor license - if it they can
attract a consistent stream of
customers - are advantaged and
can support a higher rent than
small retail shop or fast-food
restaurant," Faley said.
Faley added that downtown
Ann Arbor development asso-
ciates prefer a wide variety of
storefronts, mixing retail, res-
taurants and other specialty
shops. However, he said main-
taining this. diversity has been
challenging as niche stores close
due to low profits and high rent.
"It will be interesting to see
how far the mix along the Liber-
ty Street corridor will ultimately
swing," Faley said.
In order to decrease the
expense of maintaining a store-
front, Fowlerplans to displayher
merchandise at private parties
and events, as well as develop a
website for online shopping.
"I feel good about it .. closing
these doors is just going to open

However, other storeown-
ers on East Liberty said they
don't feel as optimistic about
the future.of their businesses.
more efficient work at the Uni-
versity.
"We sort of transformed the
system," Coleman said. "By
transforming the way we look at
that and having groups of facili-
ties people be responsible for a
certain part of the campus, we've
really made the work more effi-
cient and better. So there's some
ways in which our cost cutting
has created better systems than
we used to have."
Some of the planned savings in
each phase will also be incurred
from changes to health benefits
for University employees and
retirees, totaling yearly savings
of about $30 million. The Univer-
sity recently changed its health
benefits coverage for current
employees, who now have to pay
about 30 percent of their benefit
costs. Additionally, the Univer-
sity has begun to self-insure,
rather than paying outside com-
panies to provide benefits.
In 2013, retirees will also
begin paying more for benefits,
which would result in an esti-
mated savings of $9 million a
year by 2020 and ultimately, $165
million a year by 2040, for the
University.
The Committee on Retiree
Health Benefits, which was
appointed by the office of the
Provost in 2009, recommended
the change in retiree benefits last
February. Laurita Thomas, asso-
ciate vice president for human
resources and a member of the
committee, said the change was
made after comparing benefits

Angela Eddins, owner of Rocky
Mountain Chocolate Factory,
said she is concerned about the
high rent and low foot traffic,
attributing decreased sales to
a number of factors, includ-
ing the closing of Borders - a
major draw for customers to
the area.
"Borders's closing has killed
all of us," Eddins said. "We've
been open for years and we can
see our sales from when Borders
was open to when it closes, and
it's downhill."
Eddins said many customers
may also view the East Liberty
strip as unappealing due to the
high number of panhandlers,
adding that very few customers
visit her store.
"It's dead now ... It's like a
ghost town out there," Eddins
said.
Cecelia Kuzon, a sales associ-
ate at Allure Boutique, also said
she has noticed decreased busi-
ness in the area, particularly on
weekdays, since the recent clo-
sure of nearby stores.
"I think it definitely has a
lot to do with the economy and
also ... Poshh closed ... so that's
affected our business a little bit,
because not as many people even
come down this road to shop,"
Kuzon said. "I'd say business is
struggling."
offered by the University to peer
institutions and found that the
benefits the University offered
were very competitive.
"Our retiree health benefit
was one of the best in the nation
and it was also the most expen-
sive for the employer," Thomas
said. "There was an opportuni-
ty to save resources so that we
could control the cost increase
for tuition and other revenue
resources, so we decided to make
that change with lots of input
and consideration from our com-
munity, current retirees and cur-
rent faculty and staff."
Thomas added that employ-
ees who will be mostly affected
by the change are those that are
not yet hired, since the change
will be more gradual for current
employees and retirees.
"We wanted to protect current
retirees and those close to retire-
ment," Thomas said.
In addition to the cost con-
tainment initiative, the Univer-
sity's space saving initiative,
which started in 2007, has saved
the University about $462 mil-
lion in construction costs and
$18 million in annual costs by
increasing current space utiliza-
tion efficiency and decreasing
requirements for construction
expansion..,
Before the space saving ini-
tiative started, the University's
average growth rate in square
feet was 2.02 percent. Since the
initiative started, however, the
rate decreased to .43 percent,
which has helped save costs.

University President Mary Sue
Coleman said in a press release
after the speech that she sup-

accessibility of higher education,
which came after she sent an
open letter to the president last
month in which she provided sug-
gestions for decreasing the rising

Panelist John Swerdlow, senior
assistant director of Outdoor
Adventures, said he is looking
forward to the bike rental system
and the increased convenience for
students.
"I think that we can create
some opportunities with the rent-
al bikes, whether it's for freshman
or working out day trips open
for the weekend when students
might otherwise not be renting
bikes," Swerdlow said in an inter-
view after the event.
Swerdlow added implementing
a sharing system, which would
allow students to use bicycles on
campus for free as needed and
then pass them off to their peers,
is more difficult, as he has wit-
nessed the program fail in differ-
ent towns.
"The idea of the bike sharing is
very exciting, but as I've been to
many of these communities (with
bike sharing programs) and seen
it's difficult to plan successfully,"
he said. "I think people will need

LSA junior Luz Meza, co-chair
of MIRA, said undocumented
Michigan residents who have
attended school in the state are
discouraged from pursuing high-
er education because they can't
afford it. Meza said out-of-state
tuition and the inability to obtain
student loans makes paying for a
college education unrealistic for
undocumented students.
While growing up in southwest
Detroit, Meza said she had several
friends who were undocumented,
and this discouraged them from
doing well in school, adding that
even friends who were strongstu-
dents were still unable to afford
the high cost of college tuition.
Maria Ibarra, a senior at the
University of Detroit Mercy and
an undocumented Michigan resi-
dent, spoke on behalf of tuition
equality. Ibarra, who came to
Michigan when she was 9 years
old, said the University of Michi-
gan was her "dream school," but

the federal government, outside
of the (student) loan programs,
doesn't provide much direct assis-
tance to colleges and universities
that support things like tuition,"
Traugott said.
Domestic economic reform was
also at the forefront of Obama's
address. As multinational com-
panies continue to outsource
jobs, Obama stressed the impor-
tance of keeping and creating jobs
in America, especially in cities
dependent on manufacturing, like
Detroit.
"What's happening in Detroit
can happen in other industries,"
Obama said. "... It now makes
business sense ... to bring jobs
back home."
Obama noted the successful
growth and restructuring of the
automotive industry after the
federal government bailed out
Chrysler and General Motors in
2009.
"Today, General Motors is back
on top as the world's number-one
automaker," Obama said. "Chrys-
ler has grown faster in the U.S.
than any major car company. Ford
is investing billions in U.S. plants
and factories. And together, the
entire industry added nearly
160,000 jobs."
Obama also specifically refer-
enced Michigan resident Bryan
Ritterby who attended the speech,
and found work at age 55 at a local
wind turbine manufacturer.
"He found work at Energetx,
a wind turbine manufacturer in
Michigan," Obama said. "Before
the recession, the factory only
out."
Dolen added that some bik-
ers said covered bike parking is
unnecessary since bikes would
be exposed to wet conditions as
they are riding anyway. Despite
the discrepancies, most parties
agreed that there is a need for
additional bike parking, includ-
ingbetter enclosed parking areas.
These structures could be open
areas in vehicle parking struc-
tures, according to Dolen.
"Enclosed is better, because
it is better protected, and has a
higher level of security," Dolen
said.
Rackham student Parrish
Bergquist has collaborated with
the city of Ann Arbor on several
projects 'involving the Univer-
sity. She said she is pleased with
the new bike renting system, but
hopes bike sharing will eventually
be implemented.
"Bike sharing is still in the
planning and resources gathering
phase because we haven't found a
funding source for that and that's
what we are working on right
now," Bergquist said.
Emma Kelly, an LSA sopho-
more who spoke at the forum
about her biking habits, said she
leaves her bike at home during
the winter because there isn't a
place to store her bike to keep it
her inability to afford out of state
tuition and receive financial aid
kept her from attending school in
Ann Arbor.
LSA freshman Daniel Morales
was an undocumented resident
until last July, and said the Uni-
versity's heritage as a promoter of

diversity conflictswith its current
policy towards undocumented
students.
Morales said adopting a policy
of tuition equality would correct
the University's conflicting ideals.
"(It would be) fixing a flaw in
(the University's) residency policy
that was discouraging diversity
on campus while simultanieously
the University was promoting,
and asking for, diversity on cam-
pus," Morales said.
The meeting also featured a
presentation on possible renova-
tions to University Unions and
recreation buildings by Bill Can-
ning, director of the Department
of Recreational Sports, and Loren
Rullman, associate vice president
for student affairs.
Rullman and Canning have
been working with LSA sopho-
more Louis Mirante, a CSG
representative, as well as other
students on a task force to identify
problems at University Unions

Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said
in a press release that he wel-
comed the emphasis on the manu-
facturingindustry and it's place in
the nation's economic revival.
"(Obama's) focus on American
manufacturing is already paying
off in Michigan, where manufac-
turing is on the rebound and can
help lead the way to a new era of
prosperity for the middle class,"
Levin wrote in the release.
Public Policy senior Joe Sand-
man, communications direc-
tor for the University's chapter
of College Democrats, said he
is particularly looking forward
to Obama's upcoming visit to Al
Glick Field House on Friday after
the president spoke about educa-
tion and the Michigan economy
in the State of the Union address.
"(The visit is) really exciting,"
Sandman said. "I think he'll talk
about the role of education in
advancing the economy here in
Michigan."
LSA senior Anton Dirnberger,
chair of the University's chapter
of College Republicans, wrote
in an e-mail interview that the
speech was more of a campaign
tool than an address of national
issues.
"The President is going to be
visiting five battleground states

wrote. "... This State of the Union

from increased storage space on

"If we have enclosed bike racks
by the residence halls and storage
right now, students willlkeep their
bikes there," Kelly said. "I know
there is a lot of wear and tear with
the snow and if we had covered
or enclosed bike structure there
it might promote year round bik-

LSA senior Catherine Kent
said she came to voice her per-
spective, adding she developed
a particular interest in bicycle
use on campus after developing
a project for her SustAinability
on Campus class to make campus
more bike-friendly.
"There were (four) aspects
to my project - distribution of
education materials to students,
infrastructure bike lanes and bike
pathways, bike sharing/rental
program and collaboration of city
and University," Kent said. "Some
of these are happening already
and some aren't, so that's why I'm
here."
The attendees also discussed

Mirante said a survey was
e-mailed to students earlier this
month asking what improve-
ments they hoped to see in these
facilities. He added that another
survey will be sent out on Mon-
day.

Business senior Matt Eral, the
Assembly's speaker of the house,
said the next step for the resolu-
tions is implementation, which
begins by talking to University
administrators.
The meeting was lightly
attended, with only '22 represen-
tatives at opening role call and
24 at closing. After two represen-
tatives resigned from CSG, the
number of representatives needed
for quorum decreased to 21. Cur-
rentlythere are 42 standingmem-
bers in the Student Assembly,
which is less than the set capacity
of 54 if every school sent the max-
imum number of representatives
possible.
Eral said he was happy with
the results of the meeting, but
not with the meeting's atten-
dance.
"It can be a little disconcert-
ing," Eral said. "The more reps
that come, the bigger sphere of
influence (CSG has)."

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.corm is

Jordan's return impactful
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer

Junior Natalie Beilstein suffered an injury in Michigan's victory over Minnesota last weekend in Minneapolis.
Wolverines prepare for season
without standout Beilstein

By GLENN MILLER JR.
For the Daily
In her 23rd year of coaching
the Michigan women's gymnas-
tics team, Bev Plocki knows about
winning. Her teams have gone
571-202-2, won 18 Big Ten cham-
pionships, eight NCAA Regional
championships, and made 10
NCAA Super Six appearances.
She's coached 146 All-American
first- orsecond-team athletes, and
been named Big Ten Coach of the
Year 10 times.
To put it simply, Bev Plockiis a
winner. So when Plocki says the
Wolverines will be fine after los-
ing junior Natalie Beilstein, it's
easy to believe her.
"They're fighters, and so I have
every confidence in the world
that we will be able to pull things
together and have a successful
season," Plocki said.
Beilstein, who suffered an
ankle injury in Michigan's win
over Minnesota on Saturday,
will miss the remainder of the
2012 season, as confirmed by the
Michigan athletic department on
Tuesday.
"It's a majorblow, I'm not going
to lie," Plocki said. "It's definitely
going to affect us. We've got to
pull together as a team and step
up to the plate and take the atti-
tude that what doesn't kill us will
only make us stronger."
Not only is Beilstein a two-time

All-American on the floor routine,
but she is also a team leader, one
of just three juniors on this year's
senior-less squad. In the season
opener against Ohio State, Beil-
stein recorded two career-high
scores on uneven bars (9.800) and
floor (9.925). Last week against
Minnesota, she tied for first on
bars before suffering the injury
during her floor routine.
"She's actually taken it pretty
well," said junior captain Katie
Zurales. "(Though) I think she
was kind of upset and pretty
shocked to find out that her Achil-
les is gone."
Despite losing one of its best
athletes, the Michigan squad
remains confident in its youth and
determination.
"We still have enough talent on
this team, and we're still going to
be awesome this year - we just
need to stay positive and keep
believing," Zurales said.
Plocki is an experienced leader,
and she and her staff have already
begun the necessary prepara-
tions to move forward without
Beilstein. While Beilstein's injury
was unfortunate and unexpected,
it creates an opportunity for sev-
eral other Wolverines to step up
and contribute to the undefeated
squad. Plocki expects sophomore
Kristen Nagle to be an immediate
contributor. Nagle, the only Mich-
igan native on the team, has yet to
compete for the Wolverines in her

collegiatecareer and is expected
to be in the lineup for the first
time on Friday against Illinois.
"This is a great opportunity for
Kristen," Zurales said. "She hasn't
gotten to compete for us yet, so
it'll be really awesome to see her
in the floor lineup and hopefully
onvault."
Michigan has been strong this
season on vault and floor, despite
its struggles last week against
Minnesota. The Wolverines will
look to freshman Annette Miele
to fill the void on the uneven bars.
Miele made her collegiate
debut on balance beam against
Ohio State, but she is expected
to be in the bar lineup this week.
Plocki is also planning to slowly
incorporate both Miele and soph-
omore Reema Zakharia into line-
ups as the season progresses.
Plocki is prepared to continue
Michigan's undefeated record and
make a return to the Super Six in
April.
"I've had years in the past
where we've had smaller teams or
we've had a lot of injuries," Plocki
said. "I think when your back is up
against the wall, that's when you
find out what kind of team you
have.
"We have always had teams
that have come out and end up
having a good season despite
whatever has been thrown at us. I
think this team will be no differ-
ent."

"I'm back."
No, Michael Jordan isn't
returning to basketball, like
he announced in his two-word
press release in 1995. But anoth-
er Jordan has made a comeback
in a significant way. This Jordan,
however, plays for the Michigan
women's basketball team.
During the Dec. 30, 2010 game
against Ohio State, sophomore
guard Nya Jordan suffered' a
season-ending ACL injury, Her
starting position was assumed by
junior guard Courtney Boylan,
but Jordan's confidence during
Big Ten games was something
the team missed in her ahsence.
Jordan underwent surgery and
intense physical therapy dur-
ing the offseason to help get her
ready for the 2011-12 season.
At the beginning of this sea-
son, Jordan, now a junior, made
significant progress from her
injury, but her knee wasn't feel-
ing completely comfortable.
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth
noticed this ' and started fresh-
man guard Nicole Elmblad in her
place. Though Jordan has seen
action in all of the games this
season, it wasn't until Big Ten
season rolled around that she hit
her stride.
Borseth altered the starting
lineup, putting Jordan back in
to replace Elmblad, even though
he believes her knee won't be
back to 100 percent until next
season. Though he reiterates
that the last five players on the
court are the true starters, Bors-
eth understands what Jordan
brings to the table during con-
ference play.
"Nya gives us a great deal of
confidence," Borseth said. "She
plays at this level, she under-
stands how to play at this level
(and) she can play really tough
in traffic."
Borseth also said Jordan
guards and rebounds well, mak-
ing her an asset on the defensive
end.
Her confidence and ability
to hold her own against tough
Big Ten opponents is something
Elmblad doesn't have as a fresh-
man. Elmblad has yet to adapt to
the aggressiveness of conference
play, which is one of the reasons

Blue gets a true road win

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
WEST LAFAYETTE - Michi-
gan finally got the elephant off its
back - the elephant of road woes
- but it sat there until the Mack-
ey Arena clock read 00:00.
After
leading for MICHIGAN 66
almost the PURDUE 64
entire first
half, the Wolverines opened the
second half in dominant fash-
ion. With a 10-point lead mid-
way through the second stanza,
it looked like Michigan would
coast to its first true road win of
the season.
But Purdue wouldn't go away.
The final minutes of the Wolver-
ines' 66-64 victory saw the scoie'
go back and forth like a seesaw.
Redshirt sophomore forward
Jorgan Morgan made the even-
tual game-winning dunk, slam-
ming it home and hanging on
the rim with authority, to give
Michigan a 65-64 lead with 1:31
remaining.
The Boilermakers had mul-
tiple chances to take the lead
right.back, as they continuously
collected their misses, but senior
Robbie Hummel's wide-open
3-point attempt clanked out and
sophomore guard Tim Hardaway
Jr. grabbed the rebound to seal
the win.
"On the road, we would nor-
mally be down and the crowd
would get to us, but this time
we ended up coming back,"
Hardaway said. "We were just
thinking about our home games
- Northwestern and all the other
games (like) Minnesota - that
(the opposing team) came back,
took a lead, and how we finished
strong."
The beginning of the second
half belonged to Michigan (6-2
Big Ten, 16-5 overall), whose
10-point lead was the biggest
margin of the night for either
side. The spurt was largely due to
Hardaway, who came out strong
in the second half.

Michigan relaxes
during bye week

Daily Sports Editor
For one of the only times this
season, Shawn Hunwick woke
up Monday morning to an empty
athletic sched-
ule. So what NOTEBOOK
did the fifth-
year senior goalie do with his
free afternoon?
"I went to class," Hunwick
said.
What a concept. As Michigan
coach Red Berenson says, when
you play a sport at Michigan,
"you're not a normal student."
So players like Hunwick,
who has a class required for his
degree that also cuts into hockey
practice, have to make special
arrangements. Hunwick always
leaves halfway through the
three-hour class, goes to prac-
tice, then makes up the work
later in the day. For once, Hun-
wick could stay for the entire
class. The rare mid-season bye
week comes at a fortuitous time
for the Michigan hockey team.
An especially physical series
against Notre Dame left the Wol-
verines in need of rest.
"I think we're all pretty sore
after that series," said junior
forward Chris Brown. "At least I
am, I'm pretty sore. We all took a
beating, and we also gave a beat-
ing out there."
Berenson said the mental
healing during a bye week is just
as important as mending sore
muscles.
"As a player, I liked the physi-
cal rest to a certain extent, but it
was the mental rest that really ...
takes some of the mental pres-
sure off," Berenson said. "If I'm
a student, it gives me a chance to
get my head clear."
Even practice on Tuesday had
a different feel. Skaters divided
into teams and played a 3-on-3
competition. Berenson holds the

contest every year the team has
a bye week. In the past, he even
awarded a trophy.
On 'Tuesday, the blue team,
which included Hunwick and
Brown, were the victors. The
trophy, though; is no longer.
Berenson plans different types
of games throughout the bye
week targeting certain aspects
of the team's play that need
improvement. He hinted toward
a possible skills competition on
Thursday. Berenson, who played
in college and then in the NHL
from 1960-78, can appreciate
what a little rest can do for a
hockey player.
"There's never a day when
you're a player that something
doesn't hurt," Berenson said.
"The only time I woke up and
nothing hurt was when I started
coaching.And I thought, 'There's
something wrong."'
BREAKAWAY BREAK-
DOWNS: Brown and freshman
forward Alex Guptill, two of
Michigan's top scoring threats,
were undefended in Notre
Dame's zone on Saturday. No one
but the goalie was near.
Brown passed it to Guptill.
Guptill passed it back. Then they
exchanged again. A few feet
from the crease, one final pass.
It was too far. Brown's pass slid
inches past Guptill's stick.
On a two-on-none breakaway,
the duo didn't mustera shot.
The Wolverines haven't con-
verted on a breakaway in recent
memory. Berenson said the team
would focus on odd-man rushes
and the quality of puck touches
during the bye week.
After the game on Saturday,
Berenson said he was relieved
the missed opportunity didn't
decide the game, which the Wol-
verines ultimately won, 2-1.
"They were both playing very
unselfish," Berenson said. "But
it's okay. Somebody score."

The sophomore scored seven
points and assisted on a Novak
layup during an 11-3 Michigan
run. He finished with a game-
high 19 points -13 of which came
in the second half.
"I thought (Hardaway's) hus-
tle, getting that basket, was huge
for Michigan," said Purdue coach
Matt Painter. "He's a rhythm guy
- he gets into streaks. ... That's
why I told our guys, 'Don't let
Tim Hardaway get his head up,'
and we let him get going."
But Purdue (4-4, 14-7), fight-
ing to turn around its season,
wouldn't go away. The Boiler-
makers made five second-half
3-pointers, thanks to their hot-
shooting seniors.
After Hummel and Ryne Smith
traded threes, Lewis Jackson's
and-one play off of a layup gave
Purdue its first lead since the
opening minutes of the game..
The Boilermakers stretched their

lead to as many as four on mul-
tiple occasions in the second half.
Jackson led Purdue with 17
points and eight assists, and
Hummel was close behind, net-
ting 16 and dishing out six dimes.
But the Boilermakers failed
to pull away. Michigan tied the
game on a layup by freshman
point guard Trey Burke and later
took the lead, 63-62, on a Hard-
away floater that came with just
under three minutes remaining.
Redshirt sophomore forward
Jordan Morgan followed an
impressive showing at Arkan-
sas with another steady perfor-
mance, scoring 12 and pulling
down seven rebounds - a cate-
gory the Wolverines surprisingly
won, 30-23.
Senior guard Stu Douglass
also impressed, going on a five-
point scoring stretch early on and
carrying Michigan on a 10-0 run-
that gave the Wolverines an early

14-5 lead.
The senior, who entered the
game averaging just over seven
points per game, led Michigan
with seven first-half points and
finished with 12.
With a roadtrip to Columbus
this weekend looming large on
Michigan's schedule, it would
seem that the Wolverines would
be relieved to finally pick up a
true road win. But Beilein was
quick to dispel that notion.
"It's a relief to win another
game, but ,like I said, I don't
dwell on it," Beilein said. "The
ball bounced our way. It wasn't a
mindset. Our mindset's been the
same whether it was at Arkansas,
whether it was here, whether it
was (at) Indiana.
"The home and the away
games - we're just trying to get
wins, guys and gals. We're just
trying to get wins. Whether it's
home or away, it's the same deal."

'M' can't get comfortable


WEST LAFAYETTE -'
M ichigan basketball
games are appar-
ently not for the faint-
hearted.
After the team's 66-64 victory
at Purdue on Tuesday night,
Beilein took his seat in front of
the media, let out a sigh of relief
and quickly noted that four of
his team's last five games have
come down
to the final
second. As
his squad was
celebrating
the win in
the locker
room down
the hall, the LUKE
58-year-old PASCH
coach looked
worn out
by the team's grueling Big Ten
schedule.
A two-point overtime victory
over Northwestern. A one-point
win over Michigan State. A
heartbreaking two-point non-
conference loss at Arkansas.
And then this - the team's first
true road win after eight lead
changes in the final nine min-
utes - a two-point victory at
Purdue.
There's little doubt that
Beilein has picked up a few extra
gray hairs in the past few weeks.
You could see it in his face
after watching his team blow a
10-point second-half lead.
The Mackey Arena crowd
came alive. Michigan looked
flustered. Robbie Hummel
blocked a shot and scored at
the other end to give his team a
four-point lead. Beilein looked
up at the scoreboard, concerned,
and called a timeout.
Here we go again.
But this time, Beilein's guys
battled, and you have to tip your
cap to the coach.
Yesterday, he showed his
team clips of New York Giant
quarterback Eli Manning's
riveting performance against
the San Francisco 49ers in Sun-
day's NFC Championship. He
lectured his players about being
resilient in the face of adversity,
just like Eli was when he was
knocked to the ground on pass
after pass.
So exhale, coach. You deserve

Michigan coach John Beilein and Michigan topped Purdue, 66-64, on Tuesday,

it. You got your guys to play like
road warriors for the first time
this season. They outshot, out-
rebounded and outhustled the
Boilermakers all game long, and
they did it all in front of a rau-
cous opposing student section.
Breathe that sigh of relief.
But don't get too comfortable.
In fact, maybe don't even take
your shoes off when you get
home, because the truth is that
Michigan has hardly touched
the heart of its conference
schedule.
There's no doubt that the
Wolverines have impressed
early in conference play - its 6-2
record so far is tops in the Big
Ten and worlds better than it's
1-6 start a season ago.
But if you really want to prove
you belong at the top, and that
you can win against anyone,
anywhere, then now is your
chance.
There's no time to reflect on
this win. No room for compla-
cency.
On Sunday, Michigan travels
to Columbus to take on No. 4
Ohio State, where Beilein has
never won. Then, the Wolver-
ines come home to play No. 16
Indiana, where they can avenge
a two-point loss they suffered

earlier this month in Bloom-
ington. And then they hop on
the bus to East Lansing, where
No. 10 Michigan State will be
looking for blood after dropping
three straight contests against
Michigan.
It's a murderer's row of Big
Ten opponents that'll be nearly
impossible to come away from
unscathed. .
And Beilein can pretend all
he wants that he doesn't know
what's coming. After the game
on Tuesday, he claimed that he
only knew the Buckeyes were
coming up this weekend because
his wife told him that she wants
to make the trip with the team.
I don't buy it, not for one sec-
ond.
But if Beilein really doesn't
know, I'm certain his players do.
In the locker room, a number of
them talked about how the win
at Purdue was a huge confidence
booster going into the heart of
their Big Ten schedule.
So it's time to embrace it,
coach. You want to prove that
you're built to last in this league?
Don't kick your feet up just
yet. Go prove it now.

The film to premiere at the Michigan, "For a Good Time, Call ...," is geared toward college-age audiences.
Sundance return

A2 will be premiere
location for 'For a
Good Time, Call...'
By ADITI MISHRA
DailyArts Writer
"Third time's the charm,"
said Michigan Theater director
* Drew Waller about hosting Sun-
K dance USA for the third year in a
row, echoing the excitement and
anticipation within one of Ann
Arbor's characteristic establish-
ments.
The Michigan Theater stands
amid central Ann Arbor as a
remnant of the glorious "good
s old days" of American cinema,
- acknowledging and featuring
of smaller-budget independent
productions that often tend to be
far more competent and master-
ful than their blockbuster coun-
terparts. It seems a natural fit
for Sundance, which shares the
mutual goal of promoting inde-
pendent talent.'
Sundance's Senior Program-
mer David Courier discussed the
strong relationship that the fes-
tival and Ann Arbor have built
over the past three years. .
"(Michigan Theater CEO and
Executive Director) Russ Collins
is the greatest, and Michigan
Theater has been remarkable.
This has been a very, very happy
partnership. Ann Arbor was a
no-brainer for us," Courier said.
For the Michigan Theater,
the collaboration is the perfect
opportunity to attract new the-
atergoers.
"We're hoping people under-
stand that they're not only going

to get the quality experience of
being at the Michigan Theater,
but also have that great, added
bonus of watching a Sundance
movie," Waller said. "For those
who are new to being a part'of
the Michigan Theater, it'll be a
great introduction. Everybody's
going to be laughing, and why
not be in a shared experience
like that?"
Ann Arborites aren't the only
ones who have something to
gain from this event.
"For filmmakers, it's an
opportunity to connect with
growing audiences in local com-
munities," Courier explained.
Sundance will be premiering
"For a Good Time, Call..." in Ann
Arbor tomorrow night. In atten-
dance will be first-time director
Jamie Travis, screenwriter and
co-star Lauren Miller ("50/50"),
and supporting actor and 'U'
alum James Wolk ("You Again").
The theater had no idea what
they would be showing when
they were re-selected this year
for participation in Sundance.
"This is a year for female
comedies. ("For a Good Time,
Call...") is about two friends who
are enemies in college and end
up becoming friends after. It's
definitely going to relate to a col-
lege town. It's a sexy, raunchy,
female-driven comedy," Courier
said.
"This film was selected
because it will be a crowd-pleas-
er," Waller added. "Sundance
knows that even though we're
one of the smallest cities select-
ed, we're the largest venue. They
want to make sure the film they
give us is going to have every-
body walking out saying 'That

was fantastic!'"
As one of the larger Sundance
venues, the Michigan Theater
is trying to fill 1,700 seats for
an independent movie in Ann
Arbor, a relatively small city.
Some of the other cities selected
include Los Angeles and New
York - veteran cities for orga-
nizing film festivals that should
have no problem finding an
audience for whatever movie set
to premiere. But Waller is confi-
dent the theater will rise to the
challenge.
"Ann Arbor, though it is a
smaller community, has a very
smart collective of people,"
Waller said. "They get it, they
understand art, and they come
to us. We're able to present this
as the thing you need to go to, so
that's really worked in our favor.
The obstacle, if you'd call it one,
is getting people of all ages to
know that they need to come to
this."
Waller also said that this
year's premiere appeals to one
large part of Ann Arbor's popu-
lation: its students, members of a
generation that he believes will
most appreciate everything "For
a Good Time, Call..." has to offer.
"The people behind this film
are them," he explained. "If they
_ came and watched this film,
the students would recognize
that the actors are their age,
the screenwriters are their age
and the directors are their age.
They're going to perceive this
in a completely different way
than some of our older mem-
bers. They're going to respect it
because it was done on a shoe-
string budget and, you know,
anybody can do this."

Spotted: The Little
Sophisticates
Children played in their
winter wonderland at the 2012
Plymouth Ice Festival. Sub-
stantially bundled, the children
still wore their imaginations
on their sleeves. Their bold
and zany colors were reminis-
cent of former United Nations
diplomat Shail Upadhya's col-
orful suits (Google him). The
kids dressed for the jobs they
wanted: a Detroit Lions player,
a Disney princess, even Spi-
derman. No matter what they
wore, the children conquered
fear in fashion through eclec-
tic, bold ensembles reflecting a
keen eye for pattern play.

Welcome to the Random Student
Interview, where there's plenty
of alcohol, porn and illegal activ-
ity.
What are you doing on Saturdays
now that there aren't any football
games?
Well most Saturdays I sleep in, head
to the gym for an hour or two and
then I'll do some work before going
out - usually dinner with some
friends and then out to some clubs
or bars.

Touch4. Do you have a hot date or
something?
More like Ijust came from a really
gross one.
Ew. Although I'd normally not
ask you this,because truly I don't
think I want to know, this is the
RSI... so ... what happened?
(Laughs) It wasn't really a date.
More like a conversation that
included bad breath and hand
germs.

You actually go to the gym! You,
literally look like you have the
metabolism ofa4thgrader.
(Laughs) Every day! .


I'm impressed. But um, why do
you smell like alcohol?
'Cause I've been drinking, duh.
On a Thursday at 1p.m.? Getting
into the game early, I see. I like
where your head's at. Got any
more?
It helps me talk more in my discus-
sion class.
Then I'mnot surprised you're
agreeing to talk to me now!
I'm totally messing with you. I
just used some mouthwash and
Purell-ed my hands. It's a deadly
combo.

Oh, a"conversation?" That's
what we're calling it, OK. What
do youthink of SOPA?
To be honest, I can't say that I am
fully aware of every single stipula-
tion within the legislation.
Yeah, um, me either. That's why
I'm asking you. That was a very
eloquent answer, by the way.
But I can certainly say that I am
not in favor of it. In general, I am
against government censorship.
People describe these "slippery
slopes," and I think censoringthe
Internet can send us falling.
Well, what if you like to watch
porn?
Then you should have every right
to do that. Recently, there have
been issues with X-rated material
being watched in public, which
I think can be regulated, but if
someone wants to watch porn in
the privacy of their own home,
the government should have no
right to tell them no.

I agree! It's no different than
streaming Netflix. What about
illegally downloading music?
I don't illegally download music.
With YouTube, it's all free any-
way.
I illegally download music all the
time.
I just don't seea reason to.
I don't want to pay iTunes for it.
I don't pay iTunes for it; I just watch
it on YouTube.
Ah, butwhat happens whenyou
leave your computer?
If I love a.song enough, I'll pay for
it, so I can put it on my iPod.
YouTube is like your taste tester.
I guess. The 30-second clip that.
iTunes gives you is kind of stupid. I
can see the whole thing somewhere
else.
It's so stupid. It doesn't even give
you the good parts of the song.
Yeah, I think it's more to make sure
you're buying the song you want.
I think you're right, my B. Well,
hopefully you'll still be allowed
to watch porn considering your
date didn't work out.
- Jake is an LSA sophomore

he tension on the Diag was so
* palpable it seemed to tighten
the slack lines tied to trees
surrounding the horrifying
display. Pictures of suppos-
edly aborted fetuses werejuxtaposed next
to the graphic, blown-up pictures of Holo-
caust victims, the body of a dead African
child and a bolded textbook definition of
genocide.
As a proud pro-choicer, I went home to
change into my stylishly cut "I Stand With
Planned Parenthood" American Apparel
t-shirt, crafting a scathing opinion piece in
my head to write for The Michigan Daily. I
loudly ridiculed the pro-lifers, whom I char-
acterized as having "crazy eyes," with my
friends and huffed and puffed and worst of
all I dismissed the students huddled around
tables on the edge of the Diag, so frustrated
they weren't being heard that they enlisted
full color graphics that screamed.
At the time it seemed like the pro-lifers
were seriously screwing themselves over.
But I do remember seeing one young
woman, a student, standing nervously
behind the display, pro-life pamphlets in
hand. I wish I had talked to her, instead of
openly laughing at what I perceived at the
time to be really poor activism.
So months after the inflammatory dis-
play, just in time for the 39th anniversary of
Roe v. Wade, I visited the group behind the
Genocide Awareness Project - the Univer-
sity of Michigan Students for Life.
To some extent I got what I expected.
Some of the students I talked to described.
abortion as murder, genocide or killing

babies, and they referred to the clinics as
"abortion mills."
But on the other hand, the students were
rational and passionate, quick with statis-
tics. These were students accustomed to
defending their position.
LSA junior Carmen Allen, the articulate
president of Students for Life, gained noto-
riety after she helped bring the Genocide
Awareness Project to campus. When her
classmates realized she was the fiercely
pro-life Carmen who helped organize the
controversial display, she said she felt huge
walls go up in classes.
"When you do something like that, it's
one easy step to become a name instead of a
number," Allen said.
Wearing a controversial belief on your
sleeve isn't always going to win you friends.
Allen recalled one time when she was
standing in Liberty Plaza with a piece of
duct tape over her mouth to represent the
voices of "the unborn" and a pro-choice
man told her she didn't have a right to talk
about women's rights.
I know what it's like to be screamed at for
your beliefs. Standing behind a pro-choice
booth in the sweltering July heat, I bit my
tongue while one old man screamed, "How
can you as a young woman support killing
children?" I reached for one of my statis-
tics, for one of those talking points to refute
him. But it's not easy to think clearly when
someone is personally attacking you, using
your own identity to silence you.
Allen says she grew up vaguely pro-life
in line with her Christian beliefs, but when
she came to college, she finally understood

where her beliefs originated after someone
close to her had an abortion.
"It became more personal - it's not text-
book anymore," she said. "It's not even a
debate or an argument anymore. It's, 'Oh
my gosh, I know what this is.'"
I found this to be a trend among most of
the Students for Life members - they had
come to these political decisions on their
own. LSA junior Anna Paone said she came
from a liberal family and didn't become
When Allen's
classmates realized

li fe, she said she! felt

pro-life until right before she came to col-
lege. Allen said her family warned her that
being too involved in the pro-life movement
could mar her chances for employment.
. As Allen recalled her father telling her
to get back to "real stuff," I could hear my
own father sighing in exasperation when he
looked at my lefty, activist-heavy resume.
The same condescending tone, the same
dismissiveness of youthful engagement.
Watching people trash flyers for a cause
that keeps you awake at night.
I was surprised by how relaxed the atmo-

sphere at the meeting was. I'd pictured the
students behind the Genocide Awareness
Project display as fervent and self-righteous
- almost foaming at the mouth. But every-
one was casual, breaking into committees
to discuss an upcoming fundraising gala.
LSA sophomore and Students for Life
public relations chair Joe Lipa said the
reason he's pro-life is because he wants to
"save lives."
When Lipa described how Students for
Life held vigils outside of a local Planned
Parenthood buildings and handed out pam-
phlets containing information on the "truth
about abortion," I had to stifle an instinctu-
al groan. But it was impossible not be taken
in by an engrossing story Lipa told about
witnessing one woman forgo an abortion.
More important than the story was how
he told it.
"It took place in the dead of winter," Lipa
started with a flourish.
Breathlessly, he explained how he and
another student saw the anxious young man
whose girlfriend was planning on having
an abortion smoking outside the Planned
Parenthood facility. How after talking to
the two representatives, the young man
resolved to change his girlfriend's mind.
How the girl knelt to pray in the snow. How
the girlfriend, as Lipa told it, changed her
mind.
And though I don't thinka woman should
be talked into or out of what I view as a pri-
vate choice, I was taken in. My instincts
told me to question the story. I thought that
it was too perfect, but the cynic in me was
quieted by Lipa's smile. This was the story
that he probably drew on when people were
telling him again and again to shut up.
Which brings me back to the Genocide
Awareness Project situation.
It got us angry, but it also got us talking
(albeit in raised voices) about a topic that
for a lot of people is just another item on the
political agenda. The abortion issue period-
ically garners national attention, like when
pro-lifers attempted to defund Planned
Parenthoods across the country last year.
But in an era when people are constantly
bemoaning the lack of student activism,
look no further than the intense, ongoing
pro-life/pro-choice debate, which is less
about politics and more about deciding
what we value as a society.
I can't pinpoint exactly when I became
pro-choice. But it was probably around the
time I was peer pressured to sign a virgin-
ity pledge in my eighth grade health class,
when I realized my body was public prop-
erty and my sister's, my friends' and my
choices were fodder for national debate.
It's pretty easy to be pro-choice at the
University. I may have been raised in the,
religious west side of the state, but I grew
up in East Quad, where being pro-choice
is as ubiquitous as the Bob Marley posters
pasted on dorm room walls.
It's easy to get trapped in an echo cham-
ber when you think the Truth belongs to
your side. And even if we can't agree, wev.
can occasionally step across the protest
line, stop the chanting, and listen.

Anatomy
of a tutoring session
On one afternoon I was at 826, Seth Greenberg,
a second-year MBA student, was tutoring Harib
Moheyuddin, a seventh grader at Forsythe Middle
School in Ann Arbor, in math.
He's a
Moheyuddin was working on solving variable equa-
tions, and he had two worksheets spread out in front of
him. He was solving for x in the equation
9x+2=+3x
lft = 2
X =
Moheyuddin breezed through the first set of prob-
lems on the sheet. But then he reached problem E,
which asked him to solve for x in the equation, 3(x + 4):
= 18, and paused.
Greenberg asked him if he understood how to
solve the problem, but Moheyuddin didn't. Greenberg
explained the two ways to do it, drawing the solutions
out on a sheet Moheyuddin looked at for the rest of the
session and then packed away.
He finished, thanked Greenberg, and began filling
out the tutorevaluation sheet. On the second question,
which asked him how he felt about tutoring that day
and offered him the choices of an upside down kanga-
roo ("confused") or an open hand next to one showing
a peace sign (7 out of ten) among others, he circled
-I
I asked him why he had chosen the shield.
"It feels like a badge more than a shield," he said.

The extra "something" is 826's emphasis on creative writ-
ing.
Steven Gillis, the novelist who opened 826michigan in
2005, said he believes students who cannot write proficiently
are "lost."
"A lot of kids fear the blank page," he said. "A lot of kids
think they can't write or have trouble reading. And if you
can't read and write, everything just falls apart."
826michigan, as a feature of its philosophical culture and
its mission statement, strives to prevent that falling apart. The
2,330 students it helped last year span the literacy spectrum
from English-as-a-second-language learners to adept writers
who simply need a community to debate whether "serene" or
"tranquil" is the better word to use in their short story.
"What we're trying to tell them is, as long as you're writ-
ing, you can't do anything wrong," Amy Wilson, 826michi-
gan's communications coordinator, said. "So much of it is just
having somebody to say, 'Wow, you're doing really well,' and,
'This is really cool,' and, 'Maybe let's add onto it in this way."'
Wilson, who graduated from the University in 2010, is gre-
garious and somehow motherly. She sat back as I asked her
whether students seemed to at least appreciate writing more
once they had dropped in for afterschool tutoringor took part
in an in-school program. She smiled, said she had seen stu-
dents growingmore "fluent" with language, and then paused.
When she started speaking again, she had whirled herself
into one of 826michigan's mostbeloved stories. A few years ago,
the center's program director, Amy Sumerton, was struggling
to inspire a particularly averse fourth or fifth grader to write.
"And slowly, slowly he was making progress," Wilson
recalled, "and then she came in one day and he said, 'Amy,
I'm so glad you're here. There's this question I've been want-
ing to ask you all week. Is there such a thing as too much
narrative tension?' This is an eight-year-old student who had
been forced to write in his journal before. And that's amaz-
ing. We love that story."
A classroom adventure
Janet Popper, a third grade teacher at Haisley Elementary
School in Ann Arbor, was among 826michigan's early advo-
cates.

Popper graduated from the University in the 1970s and
has enjoyed writing ever since a nun read her essay aloud
when she was in middle school. She's been taking her stu-
dents on field trips to 826michigan for several years now, and
returned Jan. 13 with about 25students.
The students filed in and sat around the tables in 826mich-
igan's tutoring center while the staff fired up a PowerPoint
presenting a story. It went like this: Katie, a two-headed
dragon, had stolen the fabulous Popper Diamond, and
Jacques, a robot, his genius sidekick Evan, and Owen, chief
of police, had been charged with tracking it down. They do
so, cornering Katie the dragon ina cave, where she confesses
she has been stealing ever since she lost her favorite toy when
she was young.
Just then, a voice blasted out of the 826 staff's computer.
Calling from an Estonian castle - "definitely not Skyping in
from the basement downstairs," Selasky, the tutoring intern,
cautioned me on one of my earlier visits - was the villainous
Dr. Blotch.
Dr. Blotch was a 212-year-old Louisiana resident who
owned a booger ranch in Brazil. He hated children and
hated their stories even more, approving of none of them
and rejecting 1,300,454,556,553. But he was demanding 200
pages from Popper's class in an hour, promising none of their
endings to Jacques, Evan and Owen's lark would earn her
approval.
Dr. Blotch then signed off, and the students began scrawl-
ing furiously. A few bandied about possible endings with one
another, imagining stories of redemption for Katie or-hero-
ics for Evan, but most were silent, crafting their most daring
endings and then drawing the scene on a separate cover page.
Popper, who'd been observing from afar in the back of the
classroom, leaned toward me and explained thatthe enthusi-
asm and freedom of 826 is what keeps her coming back.
She pointed to a student she identified as the quietest in
her class and told me she'd seen her hollering and laughing
throughout the 826 visit.
She looked across the room at the kids, their heads down
in a study of their creative work.
"They're all engaged," Popper said. "This is engaged
learning. That's why I come, right there."

The storefronts

gets kids
hitting the books.
By Andrew Schulman

seemingly gratified by her indecision.
A (fittingly) literate history -
In 2000, the author Dave Eggers was liv-
ing in Park Slope, Brooklyn, something of a
nest then for aspiring writers and literary
types. Entering his third year as the editor of
McSweeney's, a literary magazine that had
not yet blossomed into the eminent publishing
house it is today, he was in the midst of writing
his first book, "A Heartbreaking Work of Stag-
gering Genius," published that year.
He was also nurturing the seedling that gave
rise to 826 National, the umbrella organization
to which 826michigan and its six sister centers
belong.
While he was mingling with fellow writ-
ers, he was contemplating the shortcomings of
urban public schools with some of his college
friends who had become teachers.
The solution - to somehow link his writer
friends with the struggling school children -
was right there.
What was missing was a conduit.
He found that conduit in 826 Valencia, the
street address of the building in San Fran-
cisco's Mission District that Eggers opened in
February 2002 to house his first tutoring cen-
ter and the headquarters of the burgeoning
McSweeney's.
Eggers, his McSweeney's staff and a few
local volunteers plied in the back of the build-
ing, inviting students to join them.
When Eggers's landlord told him the
Valencia building was zoned for retail, Egg-
ers installed a "pirate store" at the front of the
building, specializing in "scurvy-be-gone" eye
patches and other buccaneer memorabilia.
But for all of Valencia's promise of improv-
ing students' writing, they didn't hurry in.
Eggers soon determined that 826 Valencia was
suffering from a trust gap. Here he was, hop-
ingto lure kids into tutoring with a pirate store,
and nobody- even knew the tutoring was hap-
pening.
Gerald Richards, 826 National's CEO, lik-
ened it to a stranger proposing to sell kids ice
cream.
But finally news of 826's programs spread.
Students rushed in, their parents struggling to

nudge them past the miniature planks for ham-
sters and back toward the workshops.
The store, once a liability, was now winning
kids over by the dozens.
With help from the storefronts, very con-
sciously designed to meet the community on
the street, 826michigan's Liberty Street Robot
Supply and Repair (see side box), 826DC's
Museum of Unnatural History and 826NYC's
Brooklyn Superhero Supply Co. are all doing
just as well as the San Francisco location.
"It wouldn't be 826 without some sort of
front-facing, strange, magical, surreal place
that is a Bigfoot research center or a space
travel store," Richards said. "It has to have
the quirky, interesting, different, front-facing
piece of it, because I think that is the thing that
draws in everybody."
. But Richards said that the store fagade's
main function is to "de-stigmatize" tutoring,
to foster a sphere wholly apart from, and even
somehow polar to, the classroom.
"The kids, when they say they're going,
they're not like, 'I'm going to get tutoring,' "he
said. "It's like, 'I'm going to 826. I'm going to
the pirate store,' or, 'I'm going to the superhero
store.'"
Ann Arbor-bound
When 826michigan opened on June 1, 2005,
826 Valencia was thriving and Eggers had
unwrapped two more 826s, in Los Angeles and
Brooklyn.
But in Ann Arbor, the organization faced a
similar crisis of credibility. Few teachers in the
area had heard of 826, and those who had were
skeptical that the organization could offer any-
thing more than what students received in the
classroom.
That started to change when 826 employ-
ees started visiting classrooms, according to
826michigan's executive director Amanda
Uhle.
"In almost every case we would go into one
classroom because one teacher really believed
in us and was really excited," Uhle said. "And
then it didn't take long for the other teachers to
be like, 'Well, wait a minute, this looks like it's
pretty helpful and pretty good."'
