Faculty 
directors 
of 
the 
Semester in Detroit program, an 
initiative that allows University 
of Michigan students to study 
and intern with community-
based organizations in the city 
of Detroit, published a statement 
Tuesday questioning the ethics 
and effectiveness of the newly-
announced Detroit Center for 
Innovation. 
The 
statement 
represents the views of SiD 
directors and does not speak on 
behalf of SiD as a University and 
Residential College program. 
The 
Center, 
which 
they 
anticipate will cost upwards 
of $300 million, will provide 
teaching 
in 
subjects 
like 
technology 
and 
artificial 
intelligence to undergraduate 
and graduate students. It will 
also serve as a conference center 
and hotel in downtown Detroit. 
Plans to open the 14-acre 
center have received backlash 
from 
students 
and 
faculty 

since the announcement was 
made on Oct. 30 by University 
of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel. 
Days 
after 
the 
announcement, 
Amytess 
Girgis, 
One 
University 
spokesperson and LSA junior, 
circulated a petition calling 
on the University to consult 
with Detroit residents before 
undertaking large development 
projects. It also criticized the 
University for building the 
Center on the site of a since-
failed Wayne County jail. 
As 
of 
publication, 
almost 
400 people have signed the 
petition. 
Tuesday’s statement was 
written 
by 
SiD 
Director 
Stephen Ward in collaboration 
with other SiD faculty and poses 
four questions to the University 
related to the funding of the 
Center and the impact the 
project will have on Detroit 
residents.

Sunrise Movement activists occupy

Staged sit-in advocates for Green New Deal, urges to fight climate change

ANCHAL MALH
For The Daily

Approximately 
200 
people 
attended a panel Friday entitled, 
“Who is Xi: A Chinese Political 
Saga of the New Era.” The event 
focused on Xi Jinping, the current 
leader of China and was hosted by 
the Michigan China Forum, a non-
profit student organization that 
seeks to empower future leaders 
in the U.S. and China to excel on a 
global landscape.
The event started off with an 
introduction 
of 
the 
panelists: 
associate professor of Public Policy 
Ann Lin, Public Policy professor 
Alan Deardorff, Weiser Center 
for Emerging Democracies fellow 
Jundai Liu and Political Science 
professor Mary Gallagher. After 
talking 
about 
their 
academic 
backgrounds, the panelists jumped 
into a discussion of several topics. 
The 
panelists 
discussed 
President Xi and his methods of 
reshaping contemporary Chinese 
politics. Lin explained how Xi came 
to power. For a long time before 
2013, there was a lack of central 
power in China, she said. Lin 
believed Xi was a very influential 
leader for China in that he was 
able to guide China’s growth and 
trigger significant change during a 
time of stagnation.

Sunrise Movement activists hold a sit-in inside US Rep. Debbie Dingell’s office to advocate for the Green New Deal Friday.

The University of Michigan’s 
Outlaws 
and 
OUTreach 
student 
organizations 
hosted 
“#TransMatters in Law,” at the 
Trotter Multicultural Center on 
Friday. The event discussed the 
current status of name changes, 
gender markers and current law 
related to transgender rights.
The 
event 
started 
with 
an 
overview of the name-changing 
process of an individual in Michigan, 
which involves five major steps: filing 
a petition, going through fingerprint 
and 
background 
checks, 
filing 
required documents, publication of 
the name change in legal journals 
and attending a hearing. 
Law School student Richard 
Phillips is a member of OUTreach, 
a law-student-run, pro bono project 
team aimed at advocating for LGBTQ 
rights. Phillips explained the current 
state of name changing in Michigan. 
 
“I think there is this idea that 
doing legal changes and taking 
control of your own identity and 
changing something as intimate as 
your own name is something that 
one can do easily,” Phillips said. “But 
as you will find, with even just some 
cursory research, you will find that 
there is this convoluted process, and 
it cost a lot of money.”

Activists 
from 
Sunrise 
Movement Ann Arbor, a group 
focused on climate change and 
committed to garnering support 
for the Green New Deal, occupied 
the office of U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, in Ypsilanti 
on Friday. About 50 students and 
community members participated 
in the sit-in which began at about 
4:30 p.m. They sang, chanted 

and shared stories about why the 
Green New Deal matters to them. 
Dingell was not present. After 
about two hours, a majority of 
protesters left, but a smaller group 
who said they were willing to 
take an “escalated risk” spent the 
night in her office. On Saturday, 
three of these protesters were 
arrested at about 2:15 p.m. 
Sunrise Movement Ann Arbor 
protesters have staged multiple 
sit-ins at Dingell’s office asking 
her to co-sponsor the Green 

New Deal, a resolution to fight 
climate change and economic 
inequality first introduced by 
U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Edward 
Markey, 
D-Mass. 
Sunrise 
protesters initially met with 
Dingell in February to urge her 
to sign on, staging their first sit-in 
at her office last April and again 
this September. Dingell was not 
present at either protest and has 
not given a definitive response on 
whether she plans to sponsor the 

resolution. 
Although 
she 
is 
not 
a 
Green New Deal sponsor as 
of publication, Dingell has not 
been inactive in the fight against 
climate change. On Thursday, 
Dingell introduced the 100% 
Clean Economy Act of 2019, 
legislation setting a nationwide 
goal of achieving 100 percent 
clean energy economy with net-
zero climate pollution by 2050.

Palestinian-American activist

Arab Student Association hosts Linda Sarsour for discussion on identity

Palestinian-American activist Linda Sarsour speaks on intersectional feminism at Rackham Auditorium Friday.

Palestinian American political 
activist 
Linda 
Sarsour 
joined 
students on Friday as a part of the 
Arab Student Association’s Focus 
Week to discuss issues in the Arab 
community. Sarsour’s talk was the 
last event of the club’s Focus Week 
and touched upon feminism in Arab 
communities. About 100 students 
gathered in Rackham’s Auditorium 
on Friday night for the event. 
Sarsour hails from Brooklyn, 
New York, and identifies as an Arab, 
Muslim and Palestinian woman. 
During her talk, she discussed the 
importance of her identity and how 

all of her identities intertwine to 
make her the woman she is today. 
She also talked about how each 
identity intersects to influence her 
work as a political activist. 
Sarsour was the co-chair of 
the Women’s March in 2017 in 
Washington D.C. During the event 
at Rackham, she told the audience 
her perspective on becoming a 
representative for the Arab and 
Muslim community in America. 
Sarsour said when she joined the 
committee, it became a goal for 
her to ensure all of the groups she 
identifies with were heard during 
the event. 
“I had a pact to make and this is 
what women of color do,” Sarsour 

said. “If I’m on the table, I pull up 
chairs to the table that I’m at. It 
was my opportunity to say, ‘Who 
do I bring to the table from the 
communities that I come from?’” 
Sarsour also said through her 
work with the march she wanted to 
challenge stereotypes surrounding 
Muslim-American women.
“(The March is) figuring out 
how to kind of reintroduce what 
Muslim-American 
and 
Arab-
American women are, and that we 
too have a seat at the table when it 
comes to what feminism looks like,” 
Sarsour said.
Dentistry student Maya Youness 
told The Daily she was excited 
to get to hear Sarsour speak. She 

said her biggest takeaway from 
Friday’s event was learning not to 
sugarcoat the problems in different 
communities. 
“Don’t compensate,” Youness 
said. “Talk about things the way 
they are.” 
Sarsour 
said 
feminism 
in 
Western culture is often limited to 
a Caucasian perspective and leaves 
out what women of color experience. 
Sarsour explained white women 
often feel uncomfortable when she 
begins to discuss political and social 
conflict that affect women of color 
and their communities.

Sunrise 
Movement 
activists insist Dingell take 
more 
extreme 
action 
to 
fight climate change in her 
district. 
Protesters 
were 
determined 
to 
elongate 
their protest this time and 
stay until Dingell gave a 
definitive answer regarding 
the 
Green 
New 
Deal. 
Sunrise 
Hub 
Coordinator 
and LSA sophomore, Arya 
Kale, expressed the group’s 
frustration with her lack of 
response. 
“It’s not even that she’s 
saying, ‘no’; she’s just not 
giving us an answer — if 
she says ‘no,’ we know what 
action we have to take, and 
that’s putting somebody else 
into office,” Kale said.
Naina 
Agrawal-Hardin, 
Sunrise hub coordinator and 
Washtenaw 
International 
High 
School 
student, 
explained 
why 
Sunrise 
members keep coming back. 
 “We’re sitting in because 
of these twin crises we’re 
seeing in our country, which 

are climate change and also 
this skyrocketing inequality 
that’s costing millions of 
Americans not only their 
right to a livable future, but 
also their right to a good 
job and a living wage and 
dignified 
work,” 
Agrawal-
Hardin said. “We’re here to 
tell Congresswoman Debbie 
Dingell she can’t ignore us 
anymore; it’s been 10 months, 
and we need an answer.” 
At the sit-in, protesters 
took 
turns 
sharing 
why 
they believe it is critical 
for Dingell to co-sponsor 
the Green New Deal. Many 
highlighted the fact Dingell 
has 
accepted 
more 
than 
$40,000 from DTE Energy 
in campaign contributions, 
sharing concerns this money 
could be a factor in Dingell’s 
lack of support for the Green 
New Deal.
Students 
took 
turns 
giving testaments to their 
personal experiences with 
consequences 
of 
climate 
change. 
They 
spoke 
of 
the health implications of 
declining air quality and the 
environmental consequences 
of 
oil 
pipelines 
and 
deforestation, among other 

concerns, 
urging 
Dingell 
to take decisive action. At 
one point, protesters went 
around the room explaining 
the reasons they each fight 
for the Green New Deal. 
Responses included worries 
about the futures of younger 
siblings and future children, 
the 
disproportionate 
effects of climate change on 
marginalized 
communities, 
and 
the 
preservation 
of 
Michigan’s Great Lakes. 
After 22 hours of protest 
in Dingell’s office, Ypsilanti 
police removed LSA junior 
Preston 
VanAlstine; 
Washington University in St. 
Louis senior Allie Lindstrom; 
and Chair of Young Democrats 
of Michigan Leaha Skylar 
Dotson from the office. The 
protesters were taken to the 
Ypsilanti police station and 
released about two-and-a-
half hours later. 
In a statement to The Daily, 
Maggie Rousseau, Dingell’s 
communications 
director, 
said 
the 
congresswoman 
encourages constituents to 
visit her office.
“Congresswoman 
Dingell 
always welcomes constituents 
to her offices. She and her 
staff 
listen 
and 
help,” 
the statement said. “This 
group was accommodated 
overnight, for almost 24 
hours 
in 
extraordinary 
circumstances. The terms 
of our lease in this building 
prohibit 
people 
from 
sleeping in the space and 
a note from the building 
manager made that clear. 
Dingell and her staff strive 
to 
be 
good 
tenants 
to 
continue serving the people 
of the 12th Congressional 
District from her Ypsilanti 
office.”
Lindstrom explained why 
the three chose to remain in 
the office.
“We didn’t want to go 
quietly,” 
Lindstrom 
said. 
“We felt that if we left, it 
would feel like we were 
being silenced. We felt like 
Congresswoman 
Dingell 
didn’t feel the pressure to 
answer and tell us what 
she was going to do for our 
generation and how she was 
going to take action.”

Abdul 
El-Sayed, 
former 
2018 gubernatorial candidate 
and 
former 
executive 
director 
of 
the 
Detroit 
Health 
Department, 
made 
an appearance at the protest, 
giving a speech expressing 
his support for the protester’s 
work. He emphasized the 
importance 
of 
working 
together to solve climate 
issues.
“What we’re saying is that 
we are not willing to wed our 
children and our children’s 
children 
to 
a 
system 
of 
economics, to a climate, that 
fundamentally fails them,” 
El-Sayed said. “... Who suffers 
the most? People of color, 
our poor folks, our people in 
urban and rural communities. 
We’ve got an opportunity to 
say that enough is enough, 
that we need a Green New 
Deal.”
El-Sayed spoke to The Daily 
regarding 
the 
importance 
of the Green New Deal for 
Michigan. 
“We’ve got a responsibility 
to 
act, 
and 
this 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
progressive 
districts in the state, and 
our 
representatives 
ought 
to represent us,” El-Sayed 
said. “The beautiful thing 
about the Dingell legacy is 
that it was once the most 
progressive on issues related 
to climate, and I’m not seeing 
that right now — and we can 
do so much better. And what 
these folks in here recognize 
is that we don’t have time, and 
we’ve got a set of solutions, 
and the question is, why are 
they not being enacted?”
Ultimately, 
Lindstrom 
said 
the 
experience 
was 
frustrating but it would not 
deter Sunrise activists from 
returning. 
“We need a congressperson 
in office who’s going to fight 
as hard for our futures as 
we are, and while we left 
the 
office 
on 
Saturday, 
that is not the last time 
Congresswoman Dingell will 
hear from us, because this is 
not something we can take 
lightly,” Lindstrom said. “Our 
lives are at stake, and we’re 
not being heard. We will 
continue to show up until we 
know we are.”

EMMA MATI/Daily
Panelists Ann Lin, Mary Gallagher, Alan Deardorff and WCED fellow Dr. Jundai Liu discuss Chinese President Xi Jinping’s role in reshaping Chinese 
politics and relations with the United States at an event held by the Michigan China Forum in Weill Hall Friday.


Every now and then, there 
is an increase in awareness of 
mental health and wellness 
issues. 
These 
spikes 
in 
attention occur after events 
such as World Mental Health 
Day or a highly publicized 
incident 
of 
suicide. 
Thus, 
it’s extremely important to 
advocate for mental health but 
there are times when people 
fail to be compassionate or 
understanding.
On 
Nov. 
12, 
writer 
and 
singer 
Summer 
Walker canceled most of her 
North 
American 
tour 
due 
to her struggles with social 
anxiety. 
The 23 year old had been 
receiving 
backlash 
from 
some fans who had criticized 
her for not interacting with 
them 
during 
the 
concert 
meet and greets. She has 
a 
strict 
no 
hugging 
or 
touching policy when fans 
meet her which left some 
feeling unappreciated and like 
they were not getting what 
they paid for.
Walker defended herself on 
Instagram and said she avoids 
contact with others due to 
her experience as an empath. 
Being 
an 
empath 
means 

absorbing 
other 
people’s 
energies and feelings, so if 
someone is stressed, she gets 
stressed, and if someone has 
negative energy, she can feel it 
too. Despite this explanation, 
people are still saying that she 
is “scamming” or invalidating 
her mental health issues and 
telling her to do her job.
Some 
fans 
may 
not 
completely 
understand 
her 
reasonings for cancelling the 
tour, but this situation brings 
up an important dialogue 
about the pressures artists, 
especially Black women in 
the 
music 
industry, 
face. 
Black 
women 
in 
America 
are often not taken seriously 
in so many aspects of life, 
especially considering artists 
like Selena Gomez and Ariana 
Grande have canceled tours 
and 
meet 
and 
greets 
for 
mental health reasons and 
were met with understanding, 
not anger. Similarly to the 
terrifying discrimination we 
face when going to the doctor’s 
office and being told our pain 
is just an over exaggeration, 
the dismissal of our struggles 
with mental health is summed 
up to being a ‘scam.’ 
Why can’t other people 
trust us when we say enough 
is enough? Why is it that we 
have to prove our pain and 

struggles for other people to 
sympathize? I want to know, 
would they feel the same way 
if she cancelled her tour due 
to a broken leg or a bad case 
of the flu? I doubt it, because 
as a society, we do not look 
at health holistically. Taking 
care of yourself is more than 
drinking water and eating 
vegetables. It’s also knowing 
your limits and taking a step 
back when things become 
overwhelming.
There 
needs 
to 
be 
an 
understanding 
of 
personal 
boundaries 
that 
people 
create to protect themselves. 
Although being a celebrity 
is known as a position of 
privilege, and in many ways 
it definitely is, there is a lot 
of pressure to open your life 
to the world and accept any 
criticism that comes your way. 
Personally, I’m very proud 
of Summer for knowing when 
enough is enough and making 
changes in her life to protect 
her own mental health. What 
is the point of anything in life 
if you’re not doing it for your 
own growth and happiness? 
Many people can take a play 
from her book and reevaluate 
what you can cut out of your 
life to make it better for you.

Hey Black child 

Hey Black Child, 
The one that still lingers in 
the body of a twenty-one-year-
old young woman, struggling 
to find her place, do you know 
who you are? To the nine-year-
old girl who struggles with her 
natural hair, do you know who 
you want to be? And to the one-
year-old little girl, still fresh 
and innocent, do you know who 
you can be? 
If you’re listening, I want to 
share something with you. 
My mom made me read a 
book called The DNA Field 
and The Law of Resonance, 
and from viewing the title of 
the book my initial reaction 
was disappointment. The title 
screamed pretentious scientific 
theory, which decreased my 
level of interest. Ever since I 
was young, I never really liked 
science. For me, learning the 
concepts always seemed too 
complicated and I always ended 
up feeling dumb afterward. I’ve 
felt like this for a long time, 
until I gave the book a chance. 
To my surprise, I learned 
something I did understand. I 
learned about the heart. 
I learned that the heart is 
the most powerful generator of 
energy in the human body. The 
heart has an electromagnetic 
field that is 60 times stronger 
than the brain. So corny cliche 
sayings 
like, 
“follow 
your 
heart,” are actually valuable, 
and not just filler lines for the 
endings of Disney movies. The 
book says the power of your 
heart is so strong that if you 
really trust your heart, if you 
really wish with your heart, 
then the things you deeply 
want to manifest are not so far 
behind or out of reach. 
Initially I thought this was 
so cool, but then reality settled 
in. The soft voice that grew up 
but remained tied to my being, 
asked me a question. The Black 
child within me asked, “Why 
did we stop trusting our heart?” 
That was a valid question and 

called for a moment of self 
reflection. Black child, we grew 
up. We started trusting our 
brain over our heart. 
But that’s not all we did. 
We were forced to grow up. 
Black child, we were forced 
to recognize our place in the 
world. And by place, I mean 
the place in which society has 
tried to keep us stagnant. We 
had to learn how to conduct 
ourselves in a society that 
continuously 
monitors 
and 
judges our behavior. We had to 
learn how to breathe in a world 
where the air is so heavy and 
polluted with stereotypes. We 
had to learn that no matter the 
complexion of our pigment, we 
were still beautiful, no matter 
what the world said. We were 
so preoccupied with learning 
how to heal the wounds that cut 
through our melanin, we forgot 
about our heart. We were so 
busy growing up and learning, 
we simply began relying on 
our mind. We forgot about our 
heart.
But Black child, it’s okay. 
Self-reflection 
is 
good 
and 
leads us into a moment of self 
enlightenment. 
I told you in the beginning I 
was going to share something 
with you. 
Black child, I want you to 
know your heart is so strong. 
I hope you never forget that. 
We become so consumed in 
growing up and trying to 
become what we want to be, 
we’ve settled with the power 
of our minds. But the same way 
your mind can help you finish 
an exam and write a paper, your 
heart can help you manifest 
anything you want. 
Black child, remember the 
cliche disney lines that tell you 
to be true to your heart, because 
this world is tough. Sometimes 
remembering 
to 
love 
your 
melanin is tough and that’s not 
something the mind can teach. 
Keep your heart close because 
it’s been scientifically proven 
that its the strongest force in 
your body. Black child, your 
heart can help you manifest 

who you want to be. 
Black child, we were born 
in this skin for a reason. Your 
skin is divine. The way your 
hair kinks, coils, and curls in 
its own order is divine. The way 
your skin glistens boldly under 
the sun, is divine. The way you 
rise like the sun time and time 
again, is the heart of a divine 
child. 
You’re going to learn that 
there are stereotypes about you 
that aren’t true. You’re going to 
learn to navigate this world that 
feels like it loves the aesthetic 
of your culture, but couldn’t 
care less about you. But Black 
child, as you learn with your 
mind I want you to remember 
that your heart is your greatest 
power. 
 When they call you ghetto 
for dancing the way you dance, 
it’s easy to let those words 
marinate in your mind. But 
remember the sacred rhythm 
between you and your heart. 
No one hears it but you, so keep 
dancing. Let that remind you 
of who you are. When they tell 
you you’re too loud and you find 
yourself trying to be quieter, 
don’t let it consume you. Don’t 
let it marinate your mind. Sing 
your song from the roof to the 
mountain tops. You are not 
loud, you are not ghetto, your 
heart is just creating a world 
where you can be who you want 
to be. You are your own order 
and you are divine. 
Don’t think what you can be, 
feel what you can be. 
Black child, it’s okay to 
grow, 
it’s 
okay 
to 
flaunt 
your 
intelligent 
mind, 
but 
please remember your roots. 
Remember your heart and that 
it is full of life and nutritious 
like fruit. 
Hey Black child, one last 
thing,
In the words of Countee 
Cullen, “Hey Black child, do 
you know who you are? Do 
you know who you really are? 
Do you know you can be what 
you want to be?” Just ask your 
heart, not your mind, and your 
manifestations will come easily.

With the release of Marvel 
and DC movies, superheroes 
have experienced a meteoric 
rise in popularity. Since the 
reintroduction of comics into 
mainstream pop culture, the 
superhero 
genre 
has 
been 
subject to all the usual questions 
of diversity. (Notably, it wasn’t 
until 2018 that Marvel finally 
introduced its first film to star a 
non-white superhero.)
Comics 
giant 
Marvel 
attempted to address this issue, 
with new, diverse characters 
taking on the names of iconic 
heroes. After Carol Danvers 
took on the moniker Captain 
Marvel, a Pakistani American 
teen becomes the new Ms. 
Marvel. When Bruce Banner lies 
dying from radiation poisoning, 
a 
Korean 
American 
named 
Amadeus Cho turns into the 
next Hulk.
However, all this progress 
seemed doomed to come to 
a grinding halt. Marvel had 
been 
accused 
of 
pandering 
in 
their 
creation 
of 
these 
new superheroes. In a 2017 
interview with ICv2, Marvel 
sales executive David Gabriel 
said, “What we heard was that 
people didn’t want any more 
diversity. They did not want 
female characters out there. 
That is what we heard, whether 
we believe that or not. I do not 
know that that is really true, but 
that’s what we saw in sales.”
“We saw the sales of any 

character that was diverse, any 
character that was new, our 
female 
characters, 
anything 
that was not a core Marvel 
character, people were turning 
their nose up against. That was 
difficult for us because we had 
a lot of fresh, new, exciting ideas 
that we were trying to get out 
and nothing new really worked,” 
Gabriel said 
Gabriel’s statements sparked 
much backlash, and it seems, 
two years after the interview, 
that Marvel has reversed its 
stance. As part of a storyline 
event, Marvel released a series 
called The New Agents of Atlas. 
The comics star an unlikely team 
of Asian and Asian American 
heroes who team up across 
several Asian metropolises to 
save the world.
Agents of Atlas demonstrates 
what representation can be: 
Their identity is an important 
part of their character, but is 
not the only thing that defines 
them and often presents subtly. 
The team challenges the myth 
of the monolithic Asian and 
combats the oft-cited criticism 
that casting a person of color is 
merely a cosmetic choice. Their 
individual ethnic identities can 
be essential to their character. In 
the case of White Fox, her name 
isn’t just a colorful moniker: 
she is a kumiho, a magical 
nine-tailed fox straight out of 
Korean mythology. Meanwhile, 
Shang Chi and Crescent are 
masters in martial arts from 
their respective countries. And 
Luna Snow is a double threat, 
working as both a K-pop singer 

and a superhero.
As a Chinese American, I was 
thrilled to finally be able to see 
parts of myself and my friends, 
especially 
in 
the 
smallest 
things. From mentions of lack of 
fluency in the “mother tongue” 
to popular dishes, the comics 
serve up an authentic depiction 
of Asian and Asian American 
culture. One great example is 
when the team goes into hiding, 
all they have to eat is spam. 
They eagerly make good use 
of it, making spam fried rice, 
spamsilog, and spam musubi – 
dishes that are popular in the 
Philippines and Hawaii.
After New Agents of Atlas, 
Marvel brought the heroes back 
in a five-part series Agents of 
Atlas. Now, we’re nearly at the 
close of that series. (Issue #4 
was released on November 13.) 
So, what’s next? 
I’m 
hoping 
that 
Marvel 
will make Agents of Atlas a 
permanent part of their lineup. 
It’d be a good opportunity to 
explore the new characters 
it’s created, like Wave, its first 
Filipina hero. And these two 
series have already successfully 
brought niche characters – like 
White Fox, who was created for 
Marvel’s foray into webtoons, 
Korean webcomics – into the 
main Marvel universe. 
Most importantly, Agents of 
Atlas has proven that a win for 
representation can be a win for 
Marvel, too.

Yasuke

Black 
history 
does 
not 
begin 
with 
commodification.It has existed and thrived in 
many parts of the world before the Trans-Atlantic 
Slave trade. This is more evident with people 

such as “Yasuke,” otherwise known as the first 
Black Japanese Samurai. Arriving from Kyoto, 
Japan in the year 1579 as a servant for European 
missionaries, Yasuke gained the attention from the 
Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga. The warlord was 
so impressed by his charcoal skin, beautiful features 
and physique that Yasuke became Oda Nobunaga’s 
Samurai uniting Japan until 1582.

Why we should turn to carbon capture

It is time to kill the death penalty

W

ith each passing 
day, I, and many 
other 
students 
at the University 
of Michigan, give 
more 
and 
more 
hours of thought 
to 
how 
we 
can 
use 
our 
degrees 
after college. This 
decision takes time 
to plan out, rethink 
and develop into a 
carefully 
planned 
trajectory 
for 
what we expect our societal 
purpose to be. After months 
of thinking every day about 
where I want to go in life, 
I 
decided 
on 
a 
specific 
engineering pathway I could 
pursue: carbon capture.
A relatively novel topic of 
research, carbon capture is 
the process of recollecting 
carbon 
dioxide 
emitted 
into the atmosphere and 
reinserting 
the 
material 
back 
into 
underground 
storage. By converting the 
carbon dioxide gas into its 
liquid form for easy storage, 
the carbon capture process 
creates an immediate effect 
of greenhouse gas reduction 
in the atmosphere. Based 
on the extent of greenhouse 
gases that can be taken 
away from the atmosphere 
using this method and other 
similar ones, I believe the 
process of carbon capture 
will be the defining method 
to fight climate change in 
several major ways.
For 
instance, 
Chevron 
demonstrated 
one 
major 
benefit of carbon capture 
by developing greenhouse 
gas mitigation technologies. 
This company has been one 
of the pioneers of developing 
this 
process 
despite 
challenges in the research 
process 
and 
in 
making 
this process economically 
feasible. In this way, Chevron 
is guiding the models for 
carbon capture and storage 
implementation throughout 
global 
institutions 
and 
frameworks geared toward 
reaching the goals of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Special Report on 
Carbon Capture and Storage. 
Consequently, the company 
is doing its part to promote 
the systematic and effective 
development of the use of 
carbon capture and storage 
technologies.
In 
another 
example, 
Petra 
Nova, 
an 
energy 

provider based in Texas, 
has 
demonstrated 
the 
successful 
repurposing 
of 
carbon into fuel. 
This company has 
carried out both 
large 
quantities 
of 
carbon 
capture 
as 
well 
as 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
oil 
production, 
signifying 
a 
revolutionary 
method 
of 
repurposing a nonrenewable 
resource. In addition, the 
company 
has 
set 
itself 
apart 
by 
implementing 
a process that uses and 
reuses 
natural 
resources. 
In this way, Petra Nova is 
showing the practicality of 
carbon capture and storage. 
Consequently, the company 
is allowing other institutions 
to realize the feasibility of 
implementing 
the 
carbon 
capture process.
A final example can be 
seen with Shell’s mentality 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
the 

widespread implementation 
of the carbon capture and 
storage 
process. 
Sally 
Benson, a director of Shell’s 
Global Climate and Energy 
Project, commented on the 
idea that the research energy 
companies do to develop 
the carbon capture process 
doesn’t carry any meaning if 
it’s not used or implemented 
by policy. 
“As academics, we can do 
all the laboratory research 
to show the technology’s 
power. But until we have 
the industry implementing 
projects and sharing their 
insights, we’re not going 
to 
make 
the 
significant 
progress required to meet 
our climate goal,” she said. 
In this way, this company 
is working toward making 
policymakers aware of the 
importance they hold in the 

future of our contribution to 
climate change solutions.
In different circumstances, 
these 
three 
companies 
exemplify only a few of the 
many ways that the process 
of carbon capture can create 
a crucial, beneficial impact 
on our society today. By 
leading 
the 
initiative 
to 
promote the use of these 
technologies, 
providing 
information that proves this 
process’s functionality and 
emphasizing the significance 
of systematic implementation 
of 
the 
research 
behind 
these 
technologies, 
these 
companies 
are 
propelling 
society’s 
perspective 
on 
the carbon capture process. 
In 
doing 
so, 
they 
have 
demonstrated the influence 
that carbon capture can have 
not only on the quality of 
our environment, but also on 
how our society approaches 
the climate issue.
Considering 
the 
proven 
benefits of carbon capture, 
I believe the adoption of the 
initiative models are enough 
to effect the drastic change 
necessary for environmental 
improvement. 
Therefore, 
these 
adoptions 
should 
occur 
at 
institutions 
throughout the world. Here 
at the University, College 
of 
Engineering 
faculty 
and staff are leading the 
Blue Sky Initiative aimed 
at reducing and removing 
the 
emission 
of 
carbon 
dioxide into our atmosphere 
as 
well 
as 
repurposing 
collected carbon gas into 
other 
infrastructural 
materials. 
Volker 
Sick, 
DTE 
Energy 
Professor 
of 
Advanced 
Energy 
Research, 
commented 
on 
the 
opportunity 
that 
we 
have as a society to utilize 
the carbon capture process: 
“We 
believe 
innovations 
in carbon dioxide removal 
and utilization technologies 
can 
generate 
a 
carbon-
negative, 
dollar-positive 
effect 
that 
will 
reduce 
emission 
footprints 
while 
generating billions of dollars 
of 
economic 
activity 
in 
the decades ahead.” As a 
result, we should continue 
to push for this type of 
interdisciplinary, 
multi-
beneficial 
work 
for 
its 
monumental influence on the 
quality of our environment.

R

odney 
Reed 
was 
scheduled to be dead 
by 
Thanksgiving. 
After 
sitting 
on 
death row in Texas 
for over 20 years, 
his death sentence 
was 
suspended 
indefinitely. Reed 
was 
arrested 
in 1996 for the 
murder of Stacey 
Stites, a 19-year-
old 
woman. 
The 
key 
piece 
of evidence tying him to 
the crime was the semen, 
appearing to match Reed’s, 
found in Stites’s body. He 
maintains that the two of them 
were in a consensual sexual 
relationship, but at the time of 
his conviction, no witnesses 
came forward to corroborate 
the 
statement. 
However, 
Reed’s lawyers say someone 
has recently backed up Reed’s 
claim of a consensual sexual 
relationship with the victim 
— a claim that should lead 
to a new trial. Moreover, his 
lawyers say that Stites’s fiancé 
at the time, Jimmy Fennell, a 
former police officer, admitted 
to the crime while imprisoned 
for kidnapping and rape of 
a different woman in 2008. 
In 
addition, 
the 
District 
Attorney’s office has refused 
to test the murder weapon, 
a belt, for DNA. Examples 
of convictions where there 
still exists some doubt as 
to 
whether 
the 
defendant 
is 
guilty, 
such 
as 
Reed’s 
case, demonstrate that the 
death penalty is an immoral, 
expensive and biased form of 
punishment. 
Cases like these rise to 
prominence every few years: 
Someone who has been sitting 
on death row for an extended 
period of time tries as hard 
as possible to be heard when 
they say they are innocent. 
The media tends to report it 
as the date of execution draws 

closer, petitions for a new 
trial circulate the internet and 
the accused sits in his cell (it 
is almost always a 
man, as only 54 of the 
almost 2,700 people 
on death row are 
women), 
wondering 
if he will be granted 
a 
new 
trial. 
The 
complications 
surrounding 
the 
death penalty make it 
so problematic that it 
should be abolished. 
Even if someone supports 
the death penalty on moral 
grounds, they may support 
its 
abolition 
because 
of 
how 
expensive 
it 
is. 
In 
Pennsylvania alone, estimates 
put the cost of the death 
penalty at more than $350 
million. 

Judges tend to be more 
sympathetic 
in 
hearing 
appeals of death penalty cases 
than in most other cases. The 
majority of cases in which the 
prosecution seeks the death 
penalty do not end in capital 
punishment. The ones that do 
go through a lengthy appeals 
process, during which many 
of the sentences are reduced 
to life without parole. This 
means that most of the death 
penalty cases will end with 
the same ruling as life without 
the possibility of parole, but 
the process will be far more 
expensive due to an appeals 

process and draw resources 
away from areas where they 
could have more of an impact. 
These 
extended 
processes, 
however, are necessary for 
the death penalty to continue 
because of how serious such 
cases tend to be. One of the 
greatest risks in any trial is 
the possibility the accused is 
actually innocent, but those 
stakes become exponentially 
higher 
in 
death 
penalty 
proceedings.
Capital punishment is also 
biased in its sentencing because 
it is disproportionately used 
against 
African-American 
defendants. More than half of 
the current death row inmates 
are people of color. In the 
early 20th century, when it 
was most used against people 
accused of rape, 89 percent 
of the defendants were Black. 
Moreover, in the 38 states that 
still use the death penalty, 
98 percent of the prosecutors 
are white. That means white 
people are deciding that Black 
lives should end at a higher 
rate than white lives. Capital 
punishment, 
therefore, 
worsens the inequality of 
an 
already 
discriminatory 
system. Such disparities are 
unacceptable in a country 
that bases its criminal justice 
system on the idea of equality 
under the law. The death 
penalty is also unequal gender-
wise. The vast majority of 
people on death row are men, 
and defendants are almost 
seven times more likely to be 
handed a death sentence if the 
victim is a woman. 
That brings us back to 
Rodney Reed. He has fought 
tirelessly to get a new trial, and 
was lucky enough to receive 
it. Regardless, the high costs 
and problematic enforcement 
of the death penalty means it 
should be abolished.

“

Cancel culture” is back 
in the news thanks to 
President Barack Obama’s 
recent 
comments 
on the standards of 
“wokeness” 
among 
young 
people 
and 
in social media. As 
people argue cancel 
culture’s merits and 
causes, they invariably 
point to generational 
or political factors, 
such as the unique 
sensitivity 
of 
young people or a 
particularly 
offensive 
political atmosphere. However, 
these explanations miss the 
mark. To fully explain the 
phenomenon of cancel culture 
we have to look at the structure 
of social media.
Young people calling out 
harmful 
speech, 
demanding 
resignations 
and 
organizing 
boycotts is not new. What has 
changed is the means by which 
they do these things. Before 
the growth of social media, 
people were limited to paper 
petitions, 
in-person 
protests 
and 
newspaper 
op-eds 
for 
spreading their message and 
taking action. Now, anybody 
can log on to Twitter and send 
out a tweet, and if things go 
right, it will go viral, potentially 
reaching millions of people. 
This is incredibly powerful. It is 
what has driven movements like 
the Arab Spring and #MeToo. 
It has contributed to genocide 
in Myanmar and mob violence 
in 
India. 
Analyzing 
cancel 
culture 
requires 
examining 
the powerful mechanisms that 
drive social media.
Often, it seems as if cancel 
culture takes place in another 
universe. Typically, I don’t know 
the cancelers or the canceled 
personally, but I see their content 
online and feel the effects of 
their interactions offline. How 
does a small group of people 
on the internet dominate the 
national 
conversation 
and 
have real effects on people’s 
lives? Through platforms that 
encourage virality, engagement 
and extremity. 
Social 
media 
companies’ 
primary source of revenue is 
advertisements. 
More 
user 

engagement allows more ads 
to be sold. Because of this, 
companies focus on driving 
user 
engagement, 
searching for ways 
to 
grab 
users’ 
attention and hold 
it for as long as 
possible. And what 
content drives the 
most 
engagement? 
Studies 
find 
that 
negative, 
divisive 
emotions 
such 
as 
fear and anger do. 
So, thanks to the 
structure 
of 
social 
media, posts that provoke these 
emotions – content related to 
cancel culture certainly fits 
this category – rise naturally. 
Additionally, the emphasis on 
virality leads to features that 
quickly amplify and distribute 
content. Twitter trends, the 
Facebook 
news 
feed, 
the 
YouTube recommender system 
and the Instagram discover 
page simultaneously push viral 
content to keep you engaged 
and use you to make content 
more viral, a positive feedback 
loop 
that 
circulates 
posts 
quickly and widely. This is how 
a disproportionate amount of 
content related to cancel culture 
ends up in our feeds, on our 
minds and in our conversations.
Without social media, cancel 
culture would manifest itself as 
relatively normal generational 
activism. There would be good 
and bad, overzealousness and 
moral clarity. All still exist today, 
but now they exist alongside the 
democratization of information, 
the magnification of shame, 
the anonymity of social media 
and the growth of permanent, 
searchable 
digital 
records 
of our lives. This emboldens 
some people and makes others 
feel 
vulnerable, 
leading 
to 
aggression, defensiveness and 
self-censorship, 
fueling 
the 
influence of cancel culture as 
a concept and as an agent of 
change.
But what about the good, 
the speaking of truth to power, 
the legitimate criticism that 
is often labeled derogatively 
as cancel culture by those 
threatened by it? Doesn’t social 
media 
empower 
movements 

like #MeToo? Doesn’t it give 
a voice and a platform to the 
marginalized? Yes. This is the 
paradox of social media — its 
vast capacity for both good and 
bad. Implementing technology 
that deemphasizes virality or 
engagement could undermine 
important 
social 
movements 
and mute constructive criticism. 
Yet, maintaining the status 
quo is clearly not desirable 
either. Does the answer lie 
beyond technology? Education, 
morality and art — do these 
institutions have the answer? 
It seems to me that these 
non-technical 
institutions 
do indeed hold the answer, 
if there is one. Social media 
companies have no incentive to 
change the mechanisms driving 
their platforms — virality and 
engagement are key to their 
bottom line. Additionally, it’s 
not clear we should want them 
to. Many of the same features 
that drive the negative parts of 
cancel culture give a platform 
to marginalized people, and 
are 
an 
important 
tool 
for 
social 
movements. 
This 
is 
where 
non-technical 
factors 
come in. Education, morality 
and art all have the ability to 
change people’s minds. For 
example, 
Mary 
Gaitskill’s 
novella 
“This 
is 
pleasure” 
explores 
cancel 
culture 
and #MeToo from multiple 
perspectives, 
producing 
a 
complicated, 
nuanced 
piece 
that is thought-provoking and 
demands 
moderation 
from 
readers. 
Theoretically, 
art 
like “This is pleasure” could 
inspire meaningful, widespread 
changes, making people less 
likely to use social media for 
gratuitous 
denunciation 
and 
encouraging 
less 
charged, 
more offline engagement. I’m 
not 
particularly 
optimistic 
about such a transformation, 
though. It would require a 
collective awakening that seems 
impossible in today’s highly 
polarized environment where 
more pressing issues such as 
climate change fail to garner a

This past Wednesday evening, Hill Auditorium hosted the Orchestre 
Métropolitain de Montréal as part of the group’s 2019 United States tour.
According to the program, Orchestre Métropolitain began in 1981 with 
a mission “to share its passion for symphonic music and make it accessible 
to all.” Today, the Orchestre Métropolitain is the premier orchestra 
in Quebec and regularly tours to parade their musical capacity. The 
Orchestre Métropolitain visited the University Musical Society at a key 
point in the group’s history, as they will embark on their 40th season in 
2020.
Hill Auditorium was packed wall-to-wall with appreciators of classical 
music. Despite the impressive turnout, I did not see many students in the 
seats.
The performance from Orchestre Métropolitain and Joyce DiDonato 
was a showcase of pure musical talent at the classical, refined level. The 
Orchestre Métropolitain is an example of career orchestral musicians, 
and I believe it is beneficial for students to see the results of that kind of 
musical passion in the form of a beautiful performance from groups like 
the Orchestre Métropolitain.
The Orchestre Métropolitain were joined by multiple Grammy Award 
winner Joyce DiDonato. In the past, DiDonato has held residencies at 
Carnegie Hall and the Barbican Centre in London (an artist-in-residence 
is someone who is recruited by a particular institution to produce creative 
work for them on a regular basis). DiDonato treated Hill Auditorium to 
her sought-after vocals, absolutely sweeping the Ann Arbor audience 
off of their feet, yielding many a rose upon the stage at the end of her 
performance of excerpts from Mozart’s “La Clemenza di Tito, K. 621.”

The orchestra was led by Maestro Yannick Nézet-Séguin, who has an 
extensive track record as far as musical directorship goes. Nézet-Séguin 
has been the conductor of the Orchestre Métropolitain since 2000 and has 
directed music at the Metropolitan Opera, the Philadelphia Orchestra and 
the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra.
One aspect of Nézet-Séguin’s work that caught my eye was his level 
of comfort with being at the center of the stage. Nézet-Séguin cracked 
smiles, embraced DiDonato and found ways to make the audience laugh. 
The conductor is a position that would seem to carry immense pressure 
and duress, but I saw genuine joy from Nézet-Séguin as he guided the 
orchestra. It was apparent that Nézet-Séguin truly enjoyed the music he 
was cultivating, and it was heartwarming to see real passion at the root of 
this masterful directorship.
It was a remarkable experience to watch the combination of masterful 
conductorship and pure vocal talent with a robust orchestra to back it all 
up.
After leaving Ann Arbor, the Orchestre Métropolitain will continue 
their tour in New York and Philadelphia.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

ZACHARY M.S. WAARALA
Daily Arts Writer

When I tell someone that I’m a country music fan, I usually 
hear one of three different responses. Unless the person is a fan 
themselves, they either laugh me off completely, contextualize 
their interest in the genre (“I listen to it in the summer 
sometimes”) or they mention Dolly Parton. The latter comment 
is demonstrative of “the great unifier” at work, a term that the 
WNYC podcast “Dolly Parton’s America” coined for Dolly in 
its first episode. The podcast’s host, Jad Abumrad, claims that 
deciphering this universal admiration for Dolly is what sparked 
the creation of the series in the first place. Which other musical 
artist can boast crowds of drag queens and red hat wearers 
alike? Which other musician can do this as a woman over 70 
years old? Only Dolly.
My first introduction to the blonde, bedazzled “Backwoods 
Barbie” was memorably immersive. In the summer of 2013, my 
family took a trip 
to Dollywood in 
Tennessee. 
The 
theme park draws 
its 
inspiration 
from the Smoky 
Mountains 
that 
surround it, close 
to 
where 
Dolly 
actually grew up. 
In fact, a replica 
of her childhood 
home sits tucked 
away 
amid 
roller 
coasters, 
carousels 
and 
food 
stands 
in 
the center of the 
park. 
Dolly 
is 
omnipresent 
throughout 
the 
park’s 
150 
acres 
— 
on 
lamppost 
signs, 
in 
loudspeakers, 
etched 
on 
the 
backs of benches. 
But 
this 
two 
room 
cabin 
is 
undoubtedly 
the heartbeat of 
the Dollyverse. When my family huddled inside, we all spoke 
in hushed tones. Then another couple entered behind us and 
simply stared. Although it hit me then that Dolly is somehow 

sacred, I still didn’t understand why.
At first glance, she’s a walking, talking 
contradiction. Displaying a tiny cabin 
in the middle of a commercial theme 
park and presenting both as authentic is 
just one instance. Claiming to be “real” 
underneath her over-the-top appearance 
is another. But the examples continue. 
On recent albums like 2014’s Blue Smoke, 
Parton draws inspiration from a place and 
lifestyle that she left over 50 years ago. 
Dolly is a serious songwriter, but in any 
given interview you’ll find her making a 
joke about her breasts. Her iconic hit “9 to 
5” is a feminist anthem, but Dolly steers 
clear of making any overtly political 
statements. 
In 2019, artists making a stand is not 
only encouraged, but expected. Dolly 
has seemingly 
already 
made 
a 
stand 
by 
penning 
and 
singing “9 to 
5,” 
so 
what 
would 
be 
the harm in weighing in on the 
politics of today? If anything, my 
inclination is that not speaking up 
would be career-damaging. This 
is what the fifth episode of “Dolly 
Parton’s America,” titled “Dollitics,” 
investigates. 
As it turns out, Dolly has her own 
set of rules. “I don’t do politics,” 
Parton asserts in an interview with 
Abumrad, “I have too many fans on 
both sides of the fence. Of course, I 
have my opinion about everything, 
but I learned years ago to keep your 
mouth shut about things.” This was 
disheartening to hear. As a woman 
with so much fame, wealth and 
reach she could a lot of good with 
her platform politically. “Keeping 
her mouth shut” sounded more like 
a business strategy. But as Abumrad 
points out as the episode continues, 
Dolly doesn’t actually keep her 
mouth shut at all. She just doesn’t 
throw stones. 
Her implicit activism spans back to the beginning of her 
career. Never one to back down from difficult topics in song, 
“The Bridge” from 1968 is about an unmarried pregnant woman 

committing suicide. In 1980, an even more popular Parton 
released the album 9 to 5 and Odd Jobs, which includes several 
songs advocating for the humanity of marginalized people. 
In “Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos),” she sings for the 
migrant workers that are sent back to Mexico and end up dying 
in a plane crash. “The radio said they were just deportees,” 
Dolly cries. In “Dark as a Dungeon,” Dolly illuminates the poor 
working conditions in mines. 
And in the sixth episode of “Dolly Parton’s America,” a 
frustrated present-day Parton admits that “(She hates) those 
Christians that are so judgemental” toward the LGBTQ+ 
community. She refuses to go right out and say it, and she 
refuses to bash anyone, but Dolly is very much her own kind 
of activist — one that charmingly disarms others by making 
jokes about her own appearance, one that accepts everyone, but 
definitely doesn’t always agree with them. Her stance is quiet 
in interviews, but loud on her albums. This is just one piece of 
the puzzle that makes Dolly so enchanting, but it’s especially 
relevant in 2019. 
As the election cycle picks up speed this year, I’m curious to 
see how artists respond. Will more statement songs like “This 
Is America” be released and become popular? Will pop instead 
lean away from reality and into otherworldliness or escapism? 
If one thing is for certain, it’s that Dolly Parton won’t be 
endorsing anyone. But I still think that her approach to politics 
is useful. It’s a strategy for starting a dialogue. Acceptance as 
a means of meeting people where they are, not as a way to let 
harm continue unnoticed.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

KATIE BEEKMAN
Daily Arts Writer

GEORGE BUSH WHITE HOUSE

I had never been to The Fillmore before I went last 
Wednesday night for a ScHoolboy Q concert, with Nav 
as the opener. It seemed counterintuitive to me to see a 
herd of hyped-up young adult rap fans in such a classically 
beautiful theater. Talk about an interesting juxtaposition. 
The wooden floors were what really concerned me: I’ve 
seen the way wooden floors react to lots of jumping, and 
I wasn’t certain they were going to make it through the 
show. I calmed down and rationalized that the people 
running the venue knew what they were doing.
When Nav came out, I was concerned for the fate of the 
rest of the show. The crowd was dead and the performance 
had little energy behind it, with Nav simply walking 
slowly back and forth across the stage, attempting to get 
the audience to sing along to no avail. I never do this at 
concerts, but I stood looking at my phone or talking to 
my friends most of the time. I kept complaining about my 
legs hurting. It was already 8 p.m. and I had class the next 
morning. 
I kept my hopes up for ScHoolboy Q. I had wanted to see 
him in concert ever since some of my high school friends 
told me that he is a terrible live performer. I had heard 
he performed even 
his most energetic 
songs in such a 
half-hearted 
way 
that the audience 
couldn’t 
get 
invested 
in 
the 
performance. This 
fascinated me, as 
SchoolBoy 
had 
always 
been 
an 
artist whose music 
pumped me up. I 
wanted to put it to 
the test and see if 
he could prove his 
critics (my friends) 
wrong.
Long 
story 
short, he did.
Although 
not 
flawless, 
the 
performance itself, 
in 
combination 
with 
the 
energy 
from the crowd, 
allowed 
for 
a 
perfectly 
imperfect concert. 
ScHoolboy himself 
sounded 
great, 
rapping 
a 
large 
portion of the most 
of the songs, as opposed to letting the audience or backing 
track do the work for him. The audience was filled with 
diehard fans who screamed their approval after the first 
note of every song played.
One thing that pleasantly surprised me was how he 
actually played the majority of his songs all the way 

through. Many of his most popular tracks, such as “THat 
Part” with Kanye West, “CHopstix” with Travis Scott, 
“Floating” with 21 Savage, and “Collard Greens” with 
Kendrick Lamar, have substantial features on them. Many 
of the rap artists I’ve seen live only perform their portions 
of the song and then move on. For ScHoolboy, it definitely 
worked in his favor to perform the full versions of the 
songs. When there were lulls in the energy of the crowd, 
he would play one of the fan favorites and get everyone 
back into it again. Even the people in the balcony were 
standing up and dancing around to “Man of the Year” and 
“Numb Numb Juice.” 
ScHoolboy said the crowd at The Fillmore was the 
best he’d ever seen in Detroit. During pretty much the 
only time he spoke to the crowd, he said: “I’m not gonna 
lie, I don’t really be having that much fun in Detroit but 
tonight is kinda fun, dog, this is kinda tight.” Giving us the 
credit we deserved was a smart move on ScHoolboy’s part 
because the energy in the theater amped up even more 
after his speech. 
The setlist itself was quite comprehensive, covering 
most of his biggest hits while also covering a decent 
portion of the album behind this tour, CrasH Talk. The one 
place where ScHoolboy erred was with the song he chose 
to end the show. His penultimate song of the evening was 
“Hell of a Night,” which, by all standards, would have 
been a great song 
to close with. It’s 
a popular, high-
energy tune that 
had all of The 
Fillmore jumping 
off the walls.
Unfortunately, 
ScHoolboy 
tried 
to do something 
a little different 
by 
ending 
with 
“Blessed,” 
a 
slower song that 
isn’t available on 
any 
streaming 
services. 
Although 
it 
would have been 
a 
wonderful 
addition 
to 
the 
setlist 
at 
any 
other point (who 
doesn’t 
love 
an 
ode 
to 
the 
original 
fans?), 
ending the show 
with it killed the 
excitement 
that 
the rest of the 
show had built up. 
I still left sweaty 
and buzzing, but 
definitely not as much as I would have if he’d ended with 
a more “predictable” song. Despite being disappointed 
by the final note, I still left the concert satisfied and 
impressed by both his performance and the excitement of 
the crowd. For my first concert in Detroit, I really can’t 
complain.

The dawn of the holiday season calls for one thing and one thing 
only: a new Netflix Christmas flick starring Vanessa Hudgens. If 
we cannot have “High School Musical 4,” at least we can rely on 
an annual romcom starring Hudgens to spread tidings of comfort 
and joy. Last winter, we were gifted with “The Princess Switch,” 
where Hudgens plays a successful baker who trades places with 
her princess doppelganger and winds up falling in love with a 
prince. Though not exactly the “The Princess Switch” sequel 
we asked for, “The Knight Before Christmas” offers the same 
cheerful spirit and fairytale romance that we’ve been yearning 
for all year.
The movie starts with Sir Cole (Josh Whitehouse “Poldark”) 
who, at one moment, is a medieval English knight preparing for 

his younger brother’s knighthood, and the 
next, is magically transported by a wise old 
witch into a small town in Ohio in the year 
2019. Heeding the witch’s advice, Cole is 
determined to search for his life’s “quest” 
before Christmas day. Upon his arrival to 
the modern world, Sir Cole bumps into 
Brooke (Vanessa Hudgens “High School 
Musical 3”), a kind, but romantically 
skeptical high school science teacher. 
After an awkward, yet pure encounter, 
the pair meet again later that night, when 
Brooke nearly runs Sir Cole over with her 
car during a snowstorm. Out of both guilt 
and intrigue, upon learning that Sir Cole 
has no place to go, Brooke offers him a bed 
in her guest house. As the days leading up 
to Christmas go by, Sir Cole and Brooke 
prepare for the holidays together, Sir Cole 
teaching Brooke about the customs in his 
world and Brooke sharing the traditions in 
hers. A friendship between the two soon 
develops, which of course, quickly begins 
to morph into something more.
Though at surface level “The Knight 
Before Christmas” is intended strictly 
for a preteen, female audience, the movie is arguably enjoyable 
for anyone in search of a little holiday pep with a sprinkle of 
romance. Unsurprisingly, this movie follows a similar framework 
to “The Princess Switch”: a twist of fate, followed by a meet-cute, 
which ultimately leads to a budding romance. The unpredictable 
elements of “The Knight Before Christmas” are far and few in 
between, and the film certainly does not pack a whole lot of 
cinematic punch; however, it does successfully invoke a sense of 
nostalgia for the most wonderful time of year. 

With the majority of their time together filled with bread-
baking, tree-chopping and hot chocolate drinking, Brooke and 
Sir Cole are certainly no Kate and Leopold, but their love story is 
sweet and seasonal, which is a box that all holiday movies should 
check. I’ve seen my fair share of low-budget Netflix films — 
some are truly awful, without purpose or direction. But, despite 
its lack of originality or spunk, “The Knight Before Christmas” 
is a wholesome reminder that the holiday season is around the 
corner and maybe that is all that it needs to be.

Netflix’s Christmas miracle, starring Vanessa Hudgens

FILM REVIEW

SAMANTHA NELSON
Daily Arts Writer

These days, it’s hard to tell whether reality television is scripted or 
not, especially when some Kardashian scandal just so happens to get 
leaked to the press right before the latest season of “Keeping Up With 
the Kardashians.” The “reality” aspect makes it more entertaining 
to watch because it takes us away from the drama in our own lives, 

even if deep down most of us know that it’s all scripted and carefully 
produced. But this transformation to more realistic reality television 
came after a renaissance (watch some clips from the first seasons of 
“Keeping Up”), and there’s one show that seemed to miss the memo. 
That show is “Blind Date,” a reboot of a show from the early 2000s by 
the same name. Each persona is made to be a caricature of a person 
that couldn’t possibly exist in real life, which is the main indicator 
that this show didn’t make enough effort to assimilate to the current 
standard of the reality television genre.
The premiere follows two pairs every 
episode and takes each of them through their 
first date from an activity, to a bar, to a hot tub. 
The first pair’s introduced as “Party Peter” and 
“Sexy Kristen,” which you can immediately tell 
are the only two characteristics the episode 
is going to milk for the rest of their date. The 
immediate labeling of these two was already 
concerning, but what was even more alarming 
was the daunting realization that Peter referred 
to himself as “Party Peter,” a self-declared “fun 
drunk.” This was maybe after three shots. 
The only hint of three-dimensionality we see 
in Peter is his initial interview, when he takes 
on the “I work too much to find love” persona, 
which sounds like something out of a Wattpad 
story in itself. 
And it gets worse. The second pair, 
Angelique and Slick 23, have perhaps the most 
uncomfortable and cringey date of human 
existence, as if the first one wasn’t torture 
enough. It kicks off with an interview with 
Angelique, who repeats an unnecessary amount 
of times repeating how lying is a turn-off for 
her. They meet, and he introduces himself with 
an accent that he doesn’t have, then they go to 
a sex toy shop for a wholesome first date. For 

the entirety of their date, Slick 23 refuses to tell her his real name, yet 
they somehow make it to the hot tub until Angelique decides to leave. 
Probably for episode length reasons.
While the first date was bad, the second one did not allow the 
show to redeem itself in any way, but was admittedly a pinch more 
entertaining simply from the absurdity of it all. The show also inserted 
random meme-like edits to make fun of the characters, which were 
hardly ever funny or additive to the quality of the episode as a whole. 
Reality television is supposed to be trashy and dramatic, but this show 
is so far detached from “The Bachelor”-level trashy television that I 
had a near-existential crisis thinking about its place in the world of 
television as a whole. Save yourself the precious half-hour that “Blind 
Date” took up in my life and take a power nap or call your mom. It’s 
not worth it.

‘Blind Date’ is pointless but has returned to television

TV REVIEW

SOPHIA YOON
Daily Arts Writer

Cozy is one of those words that seems to have been exploited by 
Pinterest. It’s all about “cozy” interior decorating, “cozy” recipes 
for winter weekends or “cozy” winter trends. Cozy seems like milk 
foam in coffee: pretty, but perhaps unnecessary.
However, when you take into consideration the bleak and 
barbarous backdrop for the word, you might feel a bit more in its 
corner. Cozy fights the cool grey wash that hovers over everything 
in the winter, battles the glum exhaustion that plagues student’s 
faces 
and 
replenishes 
everyone’s 
deprived 
senses, 
which 
are 
exhausted 
from 
the 
boredom 
of 
a 
snow-
covered world. Really, 
cozy feels like a small 
soldier in a transitional 
time.
Out 
of 
all 
your 
transitions in flux at the 
University right now — 
between 
Thanksgiving 
break to finals season, 
from home life to campus 
life, 
from 
worrying 
about 
your 
current 
classes to building next 
semester’s schedule — 
the overarching transition is from late fall to established winter, 
a winter that has lost the excitement of initial snowfalls and has 
settled into something slower and darker. 
And quieter, too. The whiter the world looks, the quieter it gets. 
Natural sounds and human voices are pretty much gone, and if 
you take your earbuds out and listen to the ambient noise around 
you, you’ll find all that’s left is the mechanical noise of traffic and 
heating units. It’s not very pleasant, I’d actually highly recommend 
putting your earbuds back in. 
Once you plug your earbuds in, you might find yourself in the 
middle of a cozy playlist. You know the kind — singers murmuring, 

soft and low, among the susurrus of guitars and ukuleles, cellos 
and basses ringing rich and deep; all of the noises are soothing but 
a bit incomprehensible. That’s okay, though, because somehow the 
music fills a very human need: it’s warm. If the purpose of art is 
to accompany humans through life, then cozy art is vital. We slog 
through winter in search of warmth and company and are often 
met with bleak grey skies and an overwhelming feeling of isolation. 
All of winter can often feel like one massive, unending cloud 
passing over the sun, whose warmth is just barely out of reach. 
So we make art that has warmth at its heart. It’s humanity’s take 
on hibernation. We consume warm music and comforting movies 
and spiced dishes to fill our souls, as well as our senses. This art is 
a way to create a fire. We 
hang string lights and 
burn candles and brew 
tea to bury the bleakness 
of the ice and cold. 
The only true thing I 
know about transitions 
is that they are always 
happening. We as human 
beings are in a perpetual 
state 
of 
transitioning. 
Even 
endings 
and 
beginnings 
are 
not 
completely 
definite. 
Rather 
than 
endings, 
life seems to be strung 
together 
by 
infinite 
beginnings 
dovetailing 
one another. 
I think the same is true of the art we consume. The last few songs 
of our playlist often become the first few songs of our next one. One 
movie we like leads us to seeing another from the same director. 
We drift through art as we transition from excitement at winter 
into a slower seasonal sadness, from being able to freely enjoy the 
warmth of the world to being cooped up inside, from the comfort 
of a brief break at home to facing finals. Winter can feel like one big 
blank page, equally intimidating to artists, students and humans 
alike. And so we fill it with our own warmth, our own art. 
With art, we make our own homes, we ease our endless 
transitions.

The night Nico Collins fused talent with production

Monday, November 25, 2019 | michigandaily.com

Nico Collins took his time walking 

off the field Saturday night. Helmet off, 

Collins peered up at a cluster of visiting 

Michigan fans. He heard a few “Let’s 

Go Blue” chants mixed in with “Beat 

Ohio,” a smattering of yells rendering 

both incoherent.

Collins looked up and pointed his 

right arm at the fans. They responded 

in kind.

It was the final act — disappearing 

into the locker room shortly after — on 

a night Collins likely won’t forget any 

time soon. One in which the talents 

that have been plainly apparent to any 

casual fan finally met the expectations 

that came with them, when potential 

fused with production and became a 

tantalizing reality.

“Nico was just ridiculous out 

there today,” said Michigan coach 

Jim Harbaugh. “Great game for Nico 

Collins.”

As Collins and senior linebacker 

Josh Uche sat down to speak to the 

media following Michigan’s 39-14 

drubbing of Indiana on Saturday, Uche 

grabbed hold of the stat sheet, gestured 

to Collins and pointed to what could 

only have been Collins’ line. 

As he saw it — six catches, a career-

high 165 yards and three touchdowns 

— Uche’s eyes widened in excitement. 

Collins shook his head and smiled.

It’s a smile that the junior has worn 

through questions about targets and 

opportunity, frustration and struggles. 

One that’s stayed steadfast as he’s been 

handed the mantle of explaining the 

inexplicable: How a 6-foot-4 receiver 

with All-American-level ball skills 

had just 66 career catches coming into 

Saturday.

There will be no such questions any 

longer.

“Man’s a beast,” Uche said. “I 

been know that. Everyone in the 

organization, we knew that. But it’s 

like, anyone can be a practice All-

American. But to see it come to fruition 

on game days is magical. Knowing 

what somebody’s capable of doing and 

seeing them execute, it’s just great to 

see.”

For Collins, it wasn’t a night that 

seemed preordained for anything 

out of the ordinary — at least, at first. 

His outsized performance began, in 

earnest, in the middle of the second 

quarter, shortly after he and his unit 

had made some tweaks.

“As the game went on, we found 

ways to attack the defense. And that’s 

what we did,” Collins said. “It was 

kind of just, like, going to the sideline, 

(offensive coordinator Josh) Gattis 

asked us, ‘What do we see out there? 

What plays are working?’ And we told 

him.”

That gave Collins the chance to 

vocalize what he saw: Frequent one-

on-one coverage with scant safety help 

over the top. Against an overmatched 

Hoosiers’ secondary, Collins knew 

what he could do if given the chance.

“I was like, ‘The cornerback, I’m 

left one-on-one. (There are) back-

side opportunities,’ ” Collins recalled 

saying. “(Senior quarterback) Shea 

(Patterson) believed in me, and I 

believed in him.”

He and Patterson subsequently 

connected on a 24-yard touchdown, 

leaping over a cornerback after a simple 

“go route” into the end zone for a 21-14 

lead. 

But he was just getting started.

Late in the third quarter, the game 

teetering for Indiana, Collins darted 

over the middle on a slant route. 

Patterson delivered a bullet before 

the safety could cut it off, and Collins 

did the rest, galloping 76 yards for the 

knockout blow. 

“It was good to get Nico on some 

crossing routes, some slant routes, 

some deep ins,” Harbaugh said. “He’s 

very good at it, he’s a big target, a big 

catch radius, and his assortment of 

routes that he’s running has picked up 

quite a bit. And he’s coming through.”

His third and final touchdown came 

on a play that has become a staple in 

Michigan’s red zone arsenal, with 

Collins running a post over the middle, 

posting up like a power forward and 

using his big body to box out the 

cornerback. When executed, there 

are few cornerbacks that can win that 

battle one-on-one.

This particular instance — the 

exclamation point on the night — was 

a 19-yard connection to extend the 

Wolverines’ lead to 39-14, where it 

would end a quarter later. Collins stood 

up and flexed both arms. He walked 

to the sidelines, where he’d remain the 

rest of the night. Collins’ 165 receiving 

yards spearheaded a receiving corps 

that accounted for 366 in total.

Things won’t come nearly as easily 

next week against Ohio State, perhaps 

the nation’s best team. But as the 

Wolverines try to pull off a feat few 

expect, facing a challenge that requires 

the best performance of the season and 

then some, there is one main source of 

hope.

“Shea’s going through the reads, 

finding all the receivers,” Collins said. 

“That’s pretty much it. He’s just going 

through the progressions, finding the 

open receiver. He’s giving us a chance.”

Saturday, Nico Collins took his 

chance. Next Saturday, Collins will be 

instrumental in helping his team take 

theirs, too.

M

oments like these are 
the reason Michi-
gan went out and 
got Shea Patterson in the first 
place. Why they brought him 
to the Big House to toss around 
snowballs 
two winters 
ago and why 
his visit to 
a basketball 
game was 
treated like a 
parade.
He is not, 
never was 
and never 
will be the 
savior of this program — and 
those who expected as such 
placed an unattainable burden 
on his shoulders. Those people 
set themselves up for failure 
before Patterson even took a 
snap.
But they nabbed Patterson, 
a blue-chip, five-star recruit, 
from the transfer market 
because he is the most talented 
player to play quarterback at 
Michigan since Denard Rob-
inson, and it’s not particularly 
close. By certain traits, his tal-
ents even supercede those of 
Robinson. He’s the most natural 
passer Michigan’s had since 
Chad Henne; he’ll finish this 
year with the most efficient 
two-season stint at quarterback 
since Henne in 
the mid-2000s. 
None of that is 
hyperbole.
And right now, 
he’s playing the 
position at a level 
this program 
hasn’t seen in 
quite awhile. Just 
in the nick of 
time.
Michigan went 
on the road Saturday and beat 
a quality Indiana team, 39-14, 
behind 366 passing yards and 
five touchdowns from Pat-
terson. In the last two weeks, 
the senior has 750 yards, nine 

touchdowns and one intercep-
tion, while completing over 
67 percent of his passes. He’s 
thrown for four-plus touch-
downs in consecutive games 
for the first time in program 
history.
“We’re riding him,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
after Saturday’s game. “His play 
has just been outstanding. But 
he’s really seeing the field well, 
he’s taking care of the football 
at all times.”
After an uneasy first half of 
the season, Patterson has set-
tled into offensive coordinator 
Josh Gattis’ new offense, mak-
ing quicker and more deliberate 
decisions to put the defense in 
conflict horizontally and verti-
cally.
He’s doing so in a way that 
oozes command and gives 
his talented receiving corps a 
chance to make plays.
“When Shea has time like 
that, we know we can move the 
ball,” said junior receiver Nico 
Collins. “We were just out there 
having fun today. And I feel like 
we’ve been having fun as an 
offensive unit since the second 
half of that Penn State. I feel 
like we’re finally clicking. 
“We’ve got one game left, and 
it’s time to finish strong.”
Which brings us to this 
week, a game which requires 
no clarification 
to espouse its 
importance. 
Ohio State 
comes to town 
as arguably the 
most complete 
team in the 
country. The 
Wolverines are 
rightly a hefty 
underdog.
But with Pat-
terson playing the way he is, 
and the offense subsequently 
humming, Harbaugh and his 
staff have a luxury they haven’t 
had in this game in the previous 
four meetings.

In 2015, Jake Rudock went 
into this game on a good run 
in his own right. But the talent 
gap between those teams — the 
Wolverines in their first year 
under Harbaugh facing a Buck-
eyes squad that went on to win 
the National Title — was too 
wide for it to matter. The year 
after, Michigan wasn’t sure 
Wilton Speight would play due 
to injury. Even when he suited 
up (a few boneheaded mistakes 
clouding an otherwise under-
rated performance), Speight 
was never able to do the things 
Patterson can. In 2017, John 
O’Korn’s dreadful performance, 
capped by an inexplicable arm 
punt on the drive that could 
have won the game, marred 
what was otherwise a masterful 
gameplan. An average quarter-
back probably leads Michigan 

to a win that year.
Last year, Patterson was effi-
cient, but stuck in an offense 
that inherently compressed his 
skillset. He threw for 187 yards 
and three touchdowns against 
the Buckeyes, but the contrast 
in offensive paces and styles 
stuck out like a sore thumb. 
Ohio State boat raced the Mich-
igan defense for 62 points with 
ease; the Wolverines scratched 
and clawed for everything they 
could.
This year, the combination of 
talent and system are coalesc-
ing at the perfect time, and they 
give Michigan one clear reason 
for hope going into Saturday.
“We understand the level 
of intensity this game brings,” 
Patterson said Saturday. 
“Everything we do leading 
up to this game next week is 

already plain throughout the 
season. I think Ohio State, just 
the word ‘Ohio State’ in itself is 
enough for us.”
If the Wolverines somehow 
pull off a win for 
just the second 
time in 16 years 
in this rivalry, 
it will all but 
surely come with 
another monster 
performance 
from their senior 
quarterback. For 
the first time in 
the Harbaugh era, 
that hypothetical 
seems far from outlandish.
The staff doesn’t have to go 
into this game holding their 
quarterback’s hand. They aren’t 
asking him to simply manage 
the game. The goal isn’t to avoid 

turnovers and let the defense go 
win a rock fight. They are not 
designing a game plan in spite 
of him; he’s at its crux.
They’re going to ask Shea 
Patterson to 
go out and win 
this football 
game, to play 
his game and 
lead this team 
to a win that 
would recon-
figure the 
perception of 
Michigan foot-
ball. 
They’re 
going to ask that because he can 
do it.

This Shea Patterson gives Michigan a chance

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily
Senior quarterback Shea Patterson has thrown for 750 yards and nine touchdowns in his last two games, while completing over 67 percent of his passes.

When Shea has 
time like that 
... we can move

We’re riding

Irish outlast Wolverines, 76-72

Down three with 30 seconds 
remaining 
on 
Saturday, 
the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team had an opportunity to 
force overtime against Notre 
Dame. Freshman guard Michelle 
Sidor found herself open from 
three, with a chance to keep 
the Wolverines’ perfect season 
intact. 
The shot clunked off the right 
side of the rim, sealing a 76-72 
victory for the Fighting Irish 
(4-2).
The Wolverines (4-1) started 
off strong offensively, largely 
thanks to tough play down 
low from their bigs. In the first 
quarter alone, they picked up 
six offensive rebounds that led 
to nine second-chance points. 
Senior forward Kayla Robbins 
led this effort, picking up three 
first-quarter offensive boards. 
“Kayla was outstanding,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “We really challenged her 
this week to get a double-double 
and try to be a great rebounder, 
and I thought she was really a 
great rebounder for us tonight.”
The Wolverines’ dominance 
in the paint continued through 
the second quarter. They added 
six more offensive rebounds, two 
of which came from sophomore 

forward Naz Hillmon. At the end 
of the first half, Michigan had 22 
total rebounds to Notre Dame’s 
10. 
Late in the first half, the 
Wolverines struggled to pull 
away, largely because they had 
several players in foul trouble. 
Robbins, senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson, and freshman center 
Isabel Varejão each picked up 
two fouls in the first quarter, 
which limited their minutes for 
the rest of the half. 
“(Losing 
players 
to 
foul 
trouble) doesn’t give subs to 
everybody else and it forces 
people to play a lot of minutes,” 
Barnes Arico said. “I thought 
that also when we tried to put 
them back in in the first half, 
they were very tentative, and 
not playing aggressively because 
they were afraid to foul.”
Errant 
passes 
and 
miscommunications 
also 
hampered Michigan offensively. 
They gave up 11 turnovers in the 
first half, and Notre Dame tallied 
13 points off of those turnovers.
A flat offensive start in the 
second half allowed the Irish 
to jump to a three-point lead. 
After three minutes without a 
bucket, Michigan turned to its 
upperclassmen for offense. 
They responded in a big way. 
Junior forward Hailey Brown 
nailed two straight 3-pointers, 

and Robbins converted a three 
point play in what felt like a 
turning point. 
But Notre Dame kept up the 
pressure. Led by guard Destinee 
Walker’s 
nine 
third-quarter 
points, including two 3-pointers, 
the Irish cut the Wolverines’ lead 
to four entering the game’s final 
period. 
The 
fourth 
quarter 
was 
all 
Notre 
Dame. 
Defensive 
adjustments allowed the Irish 
to shut Michigan down in the 
paint, and the Wolverines only 
managed two field goals in the 
entire quarter. They didn’t help 
themselves 
on 
free 
throws, 
either — they were a poor 7-of-12 
from the line in the fourth. 
As 
the 
buzzer 
sounded, 
Michigan knew it had let this one 
get away. It had led for almost the 
entire game and used its superior 
height to dominate off the glass. 
But its careless mistakes and 24 
turnovers ultimately led to their 
defeat. 
“I would definitely say that 
they were more so our turnovers 
(and not forced by Notre Dame),” 
Brown said. “Whether that be a 
travel, or even we’re catching it, 
reversing it and throwing it right 
to the team’s hands.”
Added Barnes Arico: “I think 
we just need to be able to make 
our free throws and finish games 
out.”

‘M’ finishes best season in six years 
with Sweet 16 loss at North Carolina

2013 was a very different time. 
Barack Obama had just entered 
his second term, Avicii was at 
the top of the charts and the 
Michigan women’s soccer team 
was in the Sweet Sixteen. 
The players on this year’s team 
were just entering their preteen 
phase then, and Michigan coach 
Jennifer Klein was coaching in 
Washington. 
Fast forward six years and the 
Wolverines found themselves in 
the same spot as that 2013 squad. 
In one of the team’s most prolific 
campaigns in recent history, 
No. 19 Michigan (17-6-1 overall, 
8-2-1 Big Ten) made its deepest 
run into the NCAA Tournament 
since 2013 before falling to No. 
2 North Carolina (22-1-1, 9-0-1 
ACC) in the Sweet Sixteen, 4-0, 
on Sunday. 
Prior 
to 
the 
loss, 
the 
Wolverines 
relied 
on 
their 
improved goal-scoring ability, 
balanced offensive attack and 
depth in their 3-2 victory over 
Texas Tech on Friday in the 
second round of the tournament. 
Against 
the 
Red 
Raiders, 
Michigan dominated from the 
opening whistle. In the fifth 
minute, Big Ten Midfielder of the 
Year, junior Sarah Stratigakis, 
was given a penalty kick and got 
the goalkeeper out of place, only 
for the ball to hit the post. But, 
just three minutes later, she had 
the opportunity to atone for her 
miss. She took the ball down the 
field by herself and blasted a left-
footed shot to the upper right 
corner of the goal. 
She gave two thumbs up 
after the goal and kept moving 
forward.
“I think it speaks to her 
strength and determination not 
to allow for something like that 
to get her down,” Klein said on 
Friday. “Stratigakis is a player 
that has the ability to bring 
pressure on the goal and create 
opportunities not only for herself 
but for her teammates.”
Stratigakis’ 
goal 
was 
a 

confidence builder and provided 
the Wolverines with a sense 
of relief. Coming into Friday’s 
game, Michigan was 13-0 when 
Stratigakis had at least one point 
in a game. 
Texas Tech then equalized the 
game in the 22nd minute, killing 
Michigan’s 
momentum. 
The 
score carried into halftime. 
After playing an action-filled 
first half, the Wolverines had 
depth to their advantage. They 
were able to give their starters 
time to breath and the ability to 
have a fresh set of legs. 
“We really feel the deeper the 
bench is the more opportunities 
the team gets,” Klein said. 
“We knew it was going to be a 
physical battle and required a lot 
of players to run. We wanted to 
make sure we were rotating them 
to keep them fresher longer.”
Freshman forward Danielle 
Wolfe came off the bench and 
proved to be exactly what was 
needed to break the tie. 
Less than two minutes after 
entering the game, Wolfe headed 
in a perfectly placed pass from 
senior midfielder Brooke Cilley 
into the goal. This broke the tie, 
putting the Wolverines ahead, 
2-1.
“I think she values the minutes 
that she is given,” Klein said. “She 
knows she has the opportunity 
to be impactful with what she is 
given and takes advantage of it. 
She is a team-first mentality kid.”
The freshman’s impact wasn’t 
over. She added another goal 
in the 83rd minute, heading it 
in off a pass from sophomore 
midfielder Skylar Anderson. Her 
second goal of the day proved to 
be the game-winner, putting the 
Wolverines ahead 3-1. 
The Red Raiders were able to 
notch another goal in the 88th 
minute, but it was too little too 
late. 
No one on this roster had 
ever played in a game of this 
magnitude before, but to Wolfe, 
as a freshman, playing in the 
Sweet Sixteen had an added 
significance. 
“Its 
nothing 
like 
I 
have 

played in before,” Wolfe said. 
“Definitely an experience and a 
moment that was super surreal. 
I never thought I would get here 
and definitely took it all in.”
After the game, Klein and her 
team relished in their victory but 
remained focus on the task at 
hand — beat No. 2 overall seed, 
North Carolina. 
“Our job is not done yet. We 
are going to shock the world,” 
Klein said after the win over 
Texas Tech. 
It didn’t happen. 
The Tar Heels presented a 
level of competition that proved 
insurmountable. North Carolina 
posted an NCAA-high 18 shutouts 
and outscored opponents, 60-8, 
coming into the game.
With only one loss on the 
year, the Tar Heels came as 
advertised. 
Six 
minutes 
in, 
they notched their first goal. 
Michigan managed to keep up 
with North Carolina’s offensive 
pressure and fast pace of play for 
the first 20 minutes, as the two 
teams had equal shot totals. 
However, the Tar Heel’s bench 
proved to be better than that of 
the Wolverines. North Carolina 
was subbed in six different 
players at a time. They were able 
to play 21 players to Michigan’s 
17. 
The Tar Heels went on to 
win, 4-0, in pursuit of their 23rd 
national title. 
The Wolverines were outshot 
19-7. Junior goalkeeper Hillary 
Beal tallied eight saves in the 
effort. Her strong play was 
unable to overcome the opposing 
offensive onslaught.
The team knows there was a 
silver lining to this loss and the 
season as a whole. In only her 
second season as coach, Klein’s 
emphasis on offensive efficiency 
led the team to nearly double its 
goal total from a year before. 
2013 and 2019 have come 
and gone for Michigan. But 
Klein has led her program in 
a direction that could make 
the Wolverines’ next Sweet 
Sixteen 
hiatus 
considerably 
shorter.

Michigan 
tops 
Hoosiers, 
39-14

BLOOMINGTON — Five minutes 
in, and the game already seemed like a 
nightmare.
Indiana running back Stevie Scott 
punched the ball in the end zone and 
here it was, prophecies of a “trap game” 
coming true right in front of Michigan’s 
eyes, the monkey that is the Hoosiers 
still on its back.
Then, the Wolverines got the ball.
And as soon as Michigan’s offense 
got going, it didn’t really stop. Senior 
quarterback Shea Patterson moved the 
ball all over the field, throwing for five 
touchdowns as the wide receivers put on 
a show and the 13th-ranked Wolverines 
(9-2 overall, 6-2 Big Ten) pulled away 
in the second half to beat Indiana (7-4, 
4-4), 39-14, in a prelude to next week’s 
matchup with Ohio State.
“We heard this week that their 
coach was saying that they’re one of the 
toughest teams in the Big Ten and we 
took that as disrespect,” said fifth-year 
senior offensive tackle Jon Runyan. “So 
we came up here and we showed them 
how we play football. And we’re happy 
with the results.”
The game began with a span of 19 
frenetic minutes in which the teams 
scored two touchdowns each, in a 
reversal of your usual November Big 
Ten tilt. Michigan’s first drive was as 
methodical as the Hoosiers’, capped 
off with a 50-yard pass to freshman 
Giles Jackson and then, two plays later, 
Ronnie Bell’s first touchdown of the 
season. 
Quarterback Peyton Ramsey ran the 
ball in from the one-yard line to begin 
the second quarter. Junior wideout 
Donovan Peoples-Jones responded with 
a highlight-reel catch for a score of his 
own, then flexed for the crowd.
“Just man coverage, and then he ran 
a heck of a route and I just got the ball 
where he could catch it,” Patterson 
said. “All those guys out there tonight 
— Nico (Collins), Tarik (Black), Ronnie, 
Donovan — just give them a chance.”
After that touchdown, Don Brown’s 
defense seemed to remember what 
it was. The Wolverines adjusted to 
Indiana’s 
pass-first, 
spread-style 
offense and forced three consecutive 
three-and-outs. Meanwhile, Patterson 
threw 29- and 24-yard passes to Collins, 
the latter for a touchdown.
Michigan led by just seven at halftime. 
It seemed the perfect blueprint to 
another one of those Michigan-Indiana 
games that’s far too close for far too 
long, but as the third quarter dawned, 
the Wolverines began to pull away.
First, it was a Quinn Nordin field goal. 
Then, Collins found himself open in the 
middle of the field with only green in 
front of him for an easy touchdown — 
and Michigan tacked on a two-point 
conversion with backup quarterback 
Dylan McCaffrey to increase its lead 
to 18. After that, a strip sack gave the 
Wolverines the ball on the Hoosiers’ 
19-yard line, and Patterson connected 
with Collins again for the wideout’s 
third touchdown of the day as his 
teammates flashed three fingers to 
celebrate.
“Just momentum changing, that we 
were able to get the ball out and then 
Nico capitalized on that,” said senior 
linebacker Josh Uche. “... It was just a 
great momentum killer for them.”
Indiana threatened to put together 
a few drives, getting to Michigan’s 32 
before the fumble in the third quarter 
and driving to the Wolverines’ four 
at the start of the fourth before a 
failed fourth-down conversion left the 
Hoosiers empty-handed.
As the clock wound down, Michigan 
continued to have its way, relishing — 
finally — an easy win over a team that 
seems to always make it difficult. Cheers 
of “Let’s go blue” and “Beat Ohio” rained 
down over Memorial Stadium as the 
Wolverines got their 24th-straight win 
in the series.
All week, people spoke of this as a 
trap game, the game before The Game 
against a deceptively good opponent 
Michigan couldn’t overlook. And for 
a few seconds, the ingredients for an 
upset were there.
But as they settled in, the Wolverines 
changed the recipe and dominated — 
just the way they knew they could.
“We knew after those first two 
touchdowns, when they started slowing 
down a little bit, we knew the game was 
ours,” said sophomore defensive end 
Aidan Hutchinson. “All the momentum 
stayed with us the rest of the game and 
you could hear the crowd simmer down 
for the rest of the game. They know 
what team is in control.”

BLOOMINGTON 
— 
Shea 
Patterson’s previous pass had fallen 
hopelessly incomplete, a wide-open 
Donovan Peoples-Jones looking on 
as the ball clattered to the end-zone 
turf.
Staring into a third-and-9 from 
the Indiana 11 with Michigan 
trailing by seven, Patterson could 
have easily wilted. He could have 
found Nico Collins underneath, 
short of the first down, or fled the 
pocket in search of a few extra 
yards.
And a few weeks ago, that’s what 
he might have done. Why risk an 
interception with a field goal all 
but assured? That’s the mentality 
Patterson seemed to play with 
earlier in the season, throwing just 
five touchdowns in the Wolverines’ 
first five games.
But not now. This Patterson 
stood in the pocket, unfazed by 
the Hoosiers’ blitz, and fired a 
perfectly-thrown 
back-shoulder 
pass to Peoples-Jones, allowing 
his star receiver to make a play. 
Seconds later, this Patterson took 
to the air, both fists clenched in 
celebration. And when it was all 
over, this Patterson jogged off the 
field victorious, with 750 passing 
yards and nine touchdowns over his 
last two games.
“He beat his man and ran a 
heck of a route,” Patterson said, 
understandably shifting the credit 
onto Peoples-Jones’ highlight-reel 
catch.
Then, in a rare moment of public 
self-reflection, he turned the praise 
onto himself: “I just gave him the 
ball where he could catch it.”
Over the next three quarters, 

Michigan never looked back en route 
to a 39-14 win. And as a nervous first 
half devolved into an unexpected 
rout over the 7-4 Hoosiers, that 
mentality — as simple as it seems — 
carried the Wolverines.
It’s what allowed Patterson to 
find Collins for a trio of touchdowns, 
including two on contested end zone 
throws he might not have attempted 
a month ago. As Collins took a 
slant route 76 yards to the house on 
the second of those touchdowns, 
it would have been easy to heap 
praise on him. Doing so would have 
been justified, with his afternoon 
providing enough content for a fine 
NFL Draft highlight package.

It would also ignore the catalyst 
that makes this offense go.
“Shea’s going through the reads, 
finding all the receivers,” Collins 
said. “That’s pretty much it. He’s 
just going through the progressions, 
finding the open receiver. He’s 
giving us a chance.”
The offense, of course, doesn’t 
start and end with Patterson. When 
asked 
about 
their 
connection, 
Collins’ first reaction was to credit 
the offensive line and that’s fair. This 
offense, so predicated on options, 

only works if the quarterback has 
enough time to go through his reads.
It also only works if the run game 
keeps defenses honest — something 
it struggled with at times early in 
the season — and if receivers are 
getting open. It’s why Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh repeatedly 
defended Patterson in the face of 
early-season criticism. Even now, 
he’s wary of pinning too much credit 
or blame on one player. “A lot goes 
into each and every (play) — all 11 
(players),” Harbaugh said. “All 11 
being in sync.”
None of that, though, happens 
without Patterson.
“His rhythm, his getting the 
ball out, is all on time,” Harbaugh 
said. 
“Everything 
has 
become 
very precise with Shea, with the 
receivers, with the tight ends, 
backs. The passing game has been 
operating on time extremely well.”
When 
the 
Wolverines 
were 
written off for a dead a month ago, 
Patterson was ridiculed for saying, 
“We’re right where we want to be.”
Saturday 
night, 
sitting 
at 
a 
podium beneath Memorial Stadium, 
he acknowledged that wasn’t the 
case — it took “growing pains” to 
get where Michigan is now. But with 
one game left to define his legacy, he 
also knows what’s left to play for. 
“Just the word Ohio State in itself is 
enough for us,” Patterson said.
Minutes 
later, 
as 
Harbaugh 
sat in the same seat, extolling 
his 
quarterback’s 
performance, 
he paused and turned to a team 
spokesperson.
“Another record I think today?”
First Michigan quarterback to 
throw for four touchdowns in back-
to-back games, came the response.
“First quarterback in Michigan 
history? Wow.”

Senior quarterback Shea Patterson threw for 366 yards and five touchdowns against Indiana, helping Michigan to a 39-14 win.

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily
Michigan’s defense turned the game around after giving up 14 points on Indiana’s first three drives, shutting it down the rest of the way.

With defensive 
turnaround, 
‘M’ looks to 
Ohio State

BLOOMINGTON — Peyton Ramsey 
watched the play and jumped. His arms 
flew upwards. He landed past the goal line. 
He pumped his fist once, then pumped it 
again. He shouted.
It was only five minutes into Saturday’s 
game, and if Indiana had come in wanting 
to make a statement, there it was. An 
80-yard drive into the end zone where 
the Hoosiers’ offense hummed, where 
Michigan’s defense was set on its heels. 
A shot across the bow. And Indiana kept 
attacking.
Three drives into the game, the 
Hoosiers had 153 yards of offense, two 
touchdowns and a chance to expose the 
Wolverines a week ahead of their biggest 
game. A chance to make beating Ohio 
State seem like a pipe dream. That early 
success ended up being nearly all Indiana 
got.
It wasn’t a matter of adjustment, 
sophomore 
defensive 
end 
Aidan 
Hutchinson would say hours later, seated 
in front of a microphone still in uniform. 
It was about just settling in and letting the 
defense do its thing.
“We knew after those first two 
touchdowns, they started slowing down a 
little bit,” Hutchinson said. “We knew the 
game was ours.”
After the promise of the game’s opening 
20 minutes, Indiana ran into the same 
wall that befell Michigan State, Maryland 
and Notre Dame. In the end, Michigan 
won, 39-14, holding an offense that came 
into Saturday ranked top-15 in SP+ to less 
than five yards per play and next to no 
production after three opening drives that 
seemed to poke holes in a maize and blue 
facade.
Instead of Ramsey flying upwards, his 
fist swinging in celebration, the lasting 
image of this game for Michigan’s defense 
will be sophomore linebacker Cam 
McGrone facing the Michigan sideline, 
swaggering towards the bench and 
pointing his left arm to the side, indicating 
change of possession a second before it 
was called. That came toward the end of 
the third quarter, after Josh Uche, Carlo 
Kemp and Hutchinson converged on 
Ramsey, notched the third sack on the day 
and forced the ball loose. One play later, 
junior wideout Nico Collins was in the end 
zone with Michigan’s last touchdown of 
the day, a blowout having been codified.
“I finally was able to get one, got the 
ball out and then my man Nico capitalized 
on that,” Uche said. “… It was just a great 
momentum-killer for them.”
By that point, though, the Hoosiers’ 
momentum was all but dead. And a week 
before the Ohio State game, Michigan’s 
defense changing course mid-game and 
coming out with an emphatic win brings 
to mind what it couldn’t do against the 
Buckeyes last year.
When Ohio State hit the Wolverines 
with crossing routes early on in Columbus 
last year, Michigan tried to adjust with 
zone coverage. But when the Buckeyes 
moved their pieces on the chessboard in 
accordance, Don Brown’s defense had no 
answer — ending in a 62-39 defeat.
This year’s game won’t be last year’s. 
But with everyone’s eyes looking forward 
to Nov. 30, the Wolverines’ defense 
figuring something out on the sideline and 
dominating the rest of the game will at 
least placate some nerves.
“We just did what we were supposed 
to do, just stayed on the little things, 
on the details,” Uche said. “We just 
executed. Each player was executing their 
assignment. We just hunkered down on 
that. Coach Brown called an excellent 
game, and we just did what we were 
supposed to do.”
The schematic similarities between the 
Hoosiers and Buckeyes, both of whom run 
up-tempo, spread offenses, were brought 
up postgame. Left unsaid was the obvious: 
that stopping Indiana and stopping Ohio 
State are two entirely different things, 
both in theory and in practice. 
“We don’t see them as unbeatable,” 
Hutchinson said of Ohio State. “Every 
team can be beat and we’re just gonna go 
out there and do our job.”
By his own estimate, Jim Harbaugh will 
take about six hours to revel in Saturday’s 
win before he moves his thoughts forward. 
“I stop thinking about this game,” he said, 
“and pretty much go right to this one.”
The next week will grapple with 
a situation as frustrating as it is true. 
Michigan’s defense is playing about as 
good as it could be right now, and that still 
may not be enough next Saturday.
Still, at around 1 a.m. Sunday morning, 
when the enjoyment wears off and 
Harbaugh starts thinking about the 
weight that has dragged down his first five 
years in Ann Arbor, he’ll know his defense 
is as ready as it can be.

Wolverines get past Wright State in penalties, 5-4, advance to Sweet 16

The Ultras had moved from 
their 
resident 
bleachers 
and 
congregated at one end of the 
field. With each penalty kick came 
screams and gasps from the stands 
which were filled to capacity. As 
junior midfielder Marc Ybarra 
lined up to take his shot, though, 
there was a moment of near silence, 
punctuated by nervous murmurs. 
Everyone knew Michigan’s season 
hung in the balance.
Ybarra launched his shot to the 
right side of the goal as the keeper 
dove left. The crowd erupted in 
cheers. After a hard-fought game 
that remained 0-0 after regulation, 
No. 17-ranked Michigan (11-4-5) 
prevailed over Wright State (10-8-
3) to win 5-4 in a shootout, ensuring 
its place in the third round of the 
NCAA Tournament.
The first 90 minutes held 
no guarantees of such success, 
though. The Wolverines were 
tasked with finding their defensive 
footing with the absence of junior 
defender Jackson Ragen, replaced 
by freshman Carter Payne who has 
seen little playing time in the last 

month.
“For Carter, who hasn’t played 
since early in the season, to just 
jump in and compete was great,” 
said Michigan coach Chaka Daley. 
“Corfe (on Wright State) was a 
special player to go up against and 
(Carter) got noticeably stronger as 
the game went on.”
Offensively, both halves as 
well as extra time were defined 
by close chances for Michigan 
that couldn’t be converted. The 
Wolverines took 15 corner kicks 
over the course of the game but 
were unable to get on the board, 
despite a few resulting shots 
on goal. A near goal in the 14th 
minute captured this dynamic, as 
a corner kick from senior forward 
Jack Hallahan put a loose ball 
right in front of the net, but a shot 
from junior midfielder Carlos 
Tellez sailed it right over the 
crossbar.
After relative dominance in 
possession during the first 20 
minutes, 
the 
Raiders’ 
attack 
activated 
and 
brought 
about 
a number of close chances in 
Michigan’s 
territory. 
Wright 
State’s 
offense 
produced 
numerous shooting chances only 

to be stumped by the Wolverines’ 
defense at the last second. Raiders 
midfielder Deri Corfe almost scored 
on three occasions, his nearest 
miss coming in the 24th minute as 
Michigan freshman keeper Owen 
Finnerty swatted his shot from the 
bottom left of the goal.
This dynamic continued into the 
second half, with the Raiders often 
hovering in and around Michigan’s 
box. The crowd appeared especially 
frustrated in the 76th minute 
when a shot from junior forward 
Mohammed Zakyi missed the 
right goal post by inches. A string 
of opportunities for Michigan from 
multiple free kicks and corner kicks 
in the last five minutes of regulation 
also fizzled out.
During 
extra 
time, 
the 
Wolverines 
regained 
much 
of 
the control they had lost but still 
couldn’t convert their opportunities 
in the box. A moment of hope was 
quickly extinguished in the 103rd 
minute as sophomore forward 
Derick Broche launched the ball 
into the back of the net off a pass 
from Zakyi, only to find out that 
Michigan had been called offsides.
As the clock approached the end 
of 110 minutes of frustrating play 

for both teams, a potentially season-
ending shootout seemed inevitable. 
But Michigan had prepared for this 
possibility.
“It was definitely a hard fought 
game and by the end everyone was 
tired,” Ybarra said. “We knew we 
had to put ourselves in a spot where 
just a few moments of keeping your 
head clear and a bit of quality on 
the shot meant you knew you were 
going through.”
The Wolverines carried this 
mindset 
with 
them 
into 
the 
shootout. A save from Finnerty gave 
them the margin they needed and 
Ybarra’s shot made it official.
“Finnerty ran all five the right 
way,” Daley said. “We teach our 
guys be clinical in their approach so 
that they can save one — if they can 
save that one it gives us a chance.”
That isn’t to say Michigan was 
necessarily content squeaking by so 
narrowly. 
“We’re 
lucky 
with 
these 
shootouts at home,” Daley said. 
“We’re 2-for-2 in the last two years 
at home but 0-for-2 away.
“So we learned we probably 
can’t let it get to that point. But any 
way you can advance this time of 
year, you take it and run.”

Owen Finnerty’s penalty save gave Michigan a win over Wright State.

DURHAM, N.H. — Almost 
before 
anyone 
knew 
what 
was happening, Jake Gingell’s 
attempt 
at 
a 
pass 
out 
of 
Michigan’s 
defensive 
zone 
ended up on the tape of forward 
Angus 
Crookshank’s 
stick. 
The 
sophomore 
defenseman 
couldn’t do anything but watch 
as Crookshank steadied the puck 
and fired home a shot that cleanly 
beat senior goaltender Hayden 
Lavigne.
In the blink of an eye, New 
Hampshire tied the game at one 
goal apiece.
Thirty-nine minutes of back-
and-forth 
hockey 
later, 
the 
Wildcats were once again on the 
receiving end of an errant zone-
clearing pass. Once again, it was 
Crookshank who intercepted it.
Once again, his shot found 
twine — this time, to end the game 
just 36 seconds into overtime.
Two plays rarely tell the story 
of an entire game, but for the 
Wolverines in Saturday’s 3-2 

overtime loss to New Hampshire, 
the 
pair 
of 
defensive-zone 
turnovers 
that 
directly 
led 
to goals come pretty close to 
summarizing the night.
“We had a lot of turnovers in 
the third period tonight in what 
I call the danger zone, the top of 
the circles to the blueline, and 
that’s on our forwards,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
after the game. “We didn’t do a 
very good job for our defensemen, 
helping them out. Our forwards 
turned the puck over a number of 
times, and on the winning goal, 
same thing.”
In the third period, Michigan 
recorded just two shots on net 
while the Wildcats fired 11 shots 
at Lavigne. The total number of 
attempted shots, which includes 
shots that were blocked or missed 
the cage, was even more damning 
— the Wolverines were out-
attempted, 34 to 5.
Michigan 
struggled 
throughout the weekend to clear 
its own defensive zone and create 
extended pressure in the offensive 
zone. Saturday’s third period 
was a microcosm of the issue — 
difficulty clearing coupled with a 
few key penalties and an inability 
to capitalize on the few scoring 
chances that arose ultimately was 
the Wolverines’ downfall.
On 
Friday, 
Michigan 
was 
able to grind out a win because 
it finished just a couple more 
chances than the Wildcats did, 
and the turnovers were rarely at 
key moments of the game or in 
high-danger areas. On Saturday, 
the reverse was true.
The 
Wolverines 
most 
noticeably slipped in the third 
period, but the issues that led 
to New Hampshire’s overtime 
winner were present throughout 
the game.
Michigan was on its heels 
early after senior forward Jake 
Slaker slashed a Wildcat just 
under two minutes into the 

game. While the Wolverines 
were able to kill off the penalty, 
having to go on the penalty kill 
so early — and then kill four more 
penalties throughout the game 
— put pressure on Michigan’s 
defensemen.
When New Hampshire began 
to pressure harder and harder 
late in the third period, the 
Wolverines had little left after 
killing four of five penalties in 
the game and eight of nine on the 
weekend.
“They pushed hard, we ran 
out of gas,” Pearson said. “We 
couldn’t get out of our zone. … We 
took a couple penalties, obviously, 
bad penalties, and we were on our 
heels. We just never recovered 
from that, even in overtime.”
And along with having to 
work to kill numerous penalties, 
Michigan struggled to clear the 
puck out of its defensive zone.
Whether there was a turnover 
in the neutral zone, or a bad pass 
out of the defensive zone, or any 
other of the number of ways the 
Wolverines failed to clear the 
puck, Michigan couldn’t buy time 
in the offensive zone.
The Wolverines could hardly 
press for a go-ahead goal as the 
game wound to a close. Every 
time Michigan was on the 
breakout, the Wildcats there to 
pounce on an unforced turnover 
or force one themselves.
“The turnovers are going to kill 
you,” Pearson said. “We have to 
get that out of our game.”
On Saturday, it was two 
turnovers 
that 
killed 
the 
Wolverines’ chance for their 
first sweep since Oct. 18-19. One 
led to a tying goal early in the 
second period and one led to the 
overtime game-winner.
In both situations — and 
throughout the game — it was 
mistakes by Michigan that led 
to chances for New Hampshire, 
and the Wildcats were ready to 
capitalize.

DURHAM, 
N.H. 
— 
After 
surviving a tough third period in 
which it was outshot by nine, the 
Michigan hockey team (4-8-2) 
found itself heading to overtime 
against New Hampshire (6-5-1) on 
Saturday night.
The quick break didn’t offer 
enough of a reset, though, and 
just over 30 seconds into the 
extra 
period, 
forward 
Angus 
Crookshank stole the puck in 
the low slot and capitalized. 
With that goal, Crookshank stole 
the Wolverines’ chance for the 
weekend sweep, as they fell, 3-2, to 
the Wildcats.
“Tough loss,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. “I like our team 
at times, I think, through the first 
two periods tonight. Obviously, 
third period we ran out of gas. … 
We were on our heels, and we just 
never recovered from that, even in 
overtime.”
Just 
like 
Friday, 
Michigan 
started Saturday’s game spending 
considerable time in its defensive 
zone. That said, at no point during 
the opening frame did things seem 
out of control.
The Wolverines’ penalty kill 
unit was successful on both of 
its runs during the first period. 
The first of those penalties came 
within the first two minutes. And 
soon after that, Michigan found its 
footing on the attack.
Halfway 
through 
the 
first 
period, the Wolverines went on 
their first power play of the night 
after forward Chase Stevenson 
interfered with senior forward 
Nick Pastujov. Michigan put the 
extra man to use, with senior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood 
and 
sophomore 
forward 
Jimmy 
Lambert getting multiple shots. 
And then with about 30 seconds 
remaining with the advantage, 
junior forward Michael Pastujov 
collected the puck near the right 

side. He worked his way to the right 
circle and sent a wrister through 
two defenders and into the net to 
give his team a one-goal lead.
New Hampshire’s offense had 
a streaky element to it. Once in 
the offensive zone, it used bursts 
of speed to quickly attack, but the 
Wolverines’ defensemen excelled 
early. They used their sticks 
effectively to defend rushes and 
also blocked multiple shots.
Senior 
goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne — starting for the first 
time this season — looked calm 
early on. Nevertheless, just over 
a minute into the second frame 
the Wildcats scored on him. 
Sophomore 
defenseman 
Jake 
Gingell collected a pass in the 
defensive zone but Crookshank 
stole it and successfully took on 
Lavigne. Pearson was still pleased 
with Lavigne’s overall play, though.
“Well, he earned it last week 
at Michigan State,” Pearson said. 
“He played extremely well. He’s a 
senior, he has won a lot of games 
for us, and he has worked hard in 
practice. So, it was his time and his 
turn. I thought he did a good job 
tonight.”
With the score tied early in the 
second period, the game started 
to get more physical around the 
boards as both sides searched for 
the edge. Michigan seemed to have 
established that edge with under 
seven minutes to go in the frame. 
Sophomore forward Garrett Van 
Wyhe took the puck down the 
right wing and dished it to senior 
forward Jake Slaker in the crease. 
Slaker then went forehand to 
backhand and snuck one past 
goaltender Mike Robinson for the 
lead.
But then just a few minutes 
later, after freshman forward 
Johnny Beecher got called for 
cross-checking, defenseman Max 
Gildon leveled the game from the 
right circle. That goal started a 
pause from scoring, as neither side 
took claim in the third period. New 

Hampshire hit resume shortly 
after, though.
What’s hard to swallow for the 
Wolverines is that they excelled 
in many facets but couldn’t come 
out on top. The offense showed 
signs of improvement from prior 
weekends. The penalty kill unit 
showcased its consistency, shutting 
down four opportunities Saturday 
against a top-tier special team’s 
unit. It wasn’t enough.
“We worked really well as a unit 
of four,” said senior defenseman 
Luke Martin. “Everyone knew if 
we got strung out, what to do. If 
you were in a different spot it didn’t 
matter. I thought we did that really 
well, and we had really good sticks. 
And just a good commitment.
“Everyone was bought in. Could 
really see it.”
Yet 
with 
all 
the 
bright 
spots, there’s a certain level of 
disappointment that comes with 
letting a potential road sweep slip 
from one’s hands. With all the 
glory, there is still pain.
“No moral victories,” Pearson 
said. “We have to find a way to win 
those games.”
