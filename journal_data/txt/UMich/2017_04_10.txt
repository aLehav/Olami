Top health professionals with 

different backgrounds and areas 
of expertise, including University 
of Michigan alumni, delivered 
lectures and participated in a 
panel Friday afternoon regarding 
infectious diseases and moderated 
by Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN Chief 
Medical 
Correspondent 
and 

neurosurgeon.

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

delivered the opening remarks for 
the convention to over 300 people. 
Schlissel, who received a medical 
degree from John’s Hopkins 
University, 
understands 
the 

potential threat of an emerging 

infectious disease.

“The next pandemic is not a 

matter of if, but a matter of when,” 
Schlissel said. 

Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of 

the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases at the 
National Institutes of Health, 
presented the 16th annual Horace 
W. Davenport Lecture. Fauci 
has served as a key adviser to the 
White House and the Department 
of Health and Human Services 
under five presidents.

His work at the NIH and with 

a range of presidents has taught 
him the importance and influence 
presidential 
involvement 
can 

have on controlling an outbreak, 
which he said will inevitably 
occur during a president’s term. 

Michigan 
politicians 
were 

among the approximately 10,000 
people in attendance of this year’s 
Hash Bash, signifying the push 
for marijuana legalization in the 
state.

State Rep. Yousef Rabhi (D–

Ann Arbor) spoke at the event 
and advocated for the legalization 
of marijuana, saying it would 
eventually solve infrastructure 
issues.

“If we can put a ballot initiative 

through 
that 
will 
legalize 

marijuana in Michigan and raise 
some real tax revenue for this 
state, we can fix our roads, we 
can fix our schools, we can make 
sure that we have infrastructure 
for the future of this state,” Rabhi 
said.

Rabhi’s 
language 
mirrored 

that of many other Michigan 
Democrats, 
including 
former 

State Rep. Jeff Irwin, who was 
replaced by Rabhi and is now the 
director of Michigan Coalition to 
Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol. 
The coalition aims to gain enough 
signatures 
to 
put 
marijuana 

legalization on Michigan’s ballot 
in 2018.

LSA senior Erin Dunne, who 

wrote her honors thesis on Ann 
Arbor’s Hash Bash, has dedicated 
much of her time to legalization 
efforts. Considering the number 
of organizations working toward 
legalization and the beliefs of 
voters, Dunne said she believes an 
initiative for legalization would 

likely pass.

“This 
year, 
many 
of 
the 

organizations working towards 
the same goal are part of the 
Coalition to Regulate Marijuana 
Like Alcohol,” Dunne said. “The 
resulting committee is drafting 
the 
language 
of 
initiative. 

That committee involves the 
Marijuana Policy Project, MI 
Legalize, the Michigan Cannabis 
Coalition, the National Patients 
Rights Association, the (American 
Civil Liberties Union) and the 

Marijuana Law Section of the 
state bar of Michigan.”

Despite the large turnout at 

Hash Bash, many still dissent 
to 
legalization. 
Though 
the 

University of Michigan is smoke 
free, 
Engineering 
freshman 

Lincoln 
Merrill, 
publicity 

chair 
of 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s chapter of the College 
Republicans, 
said 
legalization 

would make those who aren’t 
interested 
in 
marijuana 

vulnerable to its effects.

“Rather than affecting the 

University area, the new law 
would affect the student body 
as they could then freely roam 
Ann Arbor to smoke with no 
consequences,” 
Merrill 
said. 

“Legalizing 
marijuana 
would 

expose a lot of people who want 
nothing to do with the drug to 
secondhand smoke, but people 
should have the right to not 
breathe that secondhand smoke 
when in public.”

Ann Arbor residents on Main 

Street Sunday afternoon could 
hear FestiFools before they saw it. 
Loud drums and live music paraded 
through the city, interspersed with 
thousands of people who gathered to 
watch the event.

For the 11th year in a row, 

FestiFools took over the streets of 
downtown Ann Arbor. This year’s 
theme, 
“WishFool 
Thinking,” 

produced hundreds of giant puppet 
floats — from a giant bird made 
entirely out of balloons to President 
Donald Trump wearing a bib 
emblazoned with the Twitter logo.

Founded by Mark Tucker, arts 

director for the Lloyd Hall Scholars 
Program, and former LHSP student 
Shoshana Hurand, FestiFools is an 
annual public arts spectacle hosted 
by WonderFool Productions, a local 
nonprofit dedicated to community 
arts. The puppets are created by 
students in the Arts in Public Spaces 
class taught by Tucker, as well as in 
community art workshops. 

LHSP student Anna Minnebo, 

an LSA sophomore, participated in 
FestiFools for the second time this 
year. She said being in the FestiFools

Several distinguished alumni, 

including 
Sanjay 
Gupta, 
chief 

medical correspondent for CNN, 
actor Darren Criss and Cecilia 

Muñoz, former director for White 
House Domestic Policy Council, 
each touched on their own personal

“The Victors” that were composed

Students decorate a cube at the Community of Cultures bicentennial 
festival at Pierpont Commons on Friday 

 

Integrating Inclusion and 
Equity into the Academy

WHAT: Dr. Sam Museus from 
Indiana University will speak 
about specific strategies for 
supporting and representing 
diverse faculty at universities.

WHO: National Center for 
Institutional Diversity

WHEN: 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.

WHERE: Rackham Graduate 
School, Assembly Hall 

As the University of Michigan 

reaches its 200th year, two 
Presidential 
Bicentennial 

Professors have paid tribute to 
the innovation the school has 
been known for by announcing 
the Campus of the Future 
Competition.

For 
this 
contest, 
Joanna 

Millunchick, a material science 
and 
engineering 
professor, 

and Mika LaVaque-Manty, a 
professor of political science, are 
inviting University students and 
post-doctoral fellows from all 
disciplines to come together to 
create projects that reinvent the 
idea of the University and what 
is means to be a Wolverine. 

All University students have 

the opportunity to submit a 
project abstract by May 1, which 
could lead to a project showcase 
in October and the chance to win 
$25,000 in prizes. The projects 
will be assessed by a panel of 
judges during the showcase 
next semester. Students from all 
majors are encouraged to submit 
their ideas.

Millunchick expressed her 

excitement for the competition 

and working with students. 

“I’m really looking forward 

to seeing all the ideas, and 
getting the students to expand 
on what they’re thinking,” she 
said. “So far, the people I’ve 
met are so inspirational. It’s 
fun working with the students, 
that’s my favorite part always.”

The Campus of the Future 

Competition emphasizes three 
main scales: the room scale, 
building scale and total campus 
scale. These encompass the 
scope of what one’s project 
could focus on — they also 
challenge students to come 
up with new ideas as to how 
the University could change 
its methods to accommodate 
more individuals with diverse 
backgrounds.

According to the competition’s 

message, the University hopes 
to adapt to the ongoing needs of 
the community with the quickly 
shifting world. 

LaVaque-Manty 
further 

explained the many dimensions 
of this project and how there are 
various interpretations of what 
the prompt could mean.

“You can think of campus of 

the future in all kinds of ways,” 
he said. “When we use the word 
‘campus,’ we might be meaning 
higher education in general or 
university campuses or we might 
be meaning campuses here — and 
we might be talking about space 
in the Diag. It means all the 
things that happen on campus.”

Ann Arbor restaurant BurgerFi 

shut down abruptly, with only a sign 

on the door to notify customers. 

“The BurgerFi Restaurant is 

now closed Indefinitely with No 

Plans of Reopening,” the sign read. 

“The Owner and Staff would like To 

Thank All Our Guest [sic.] for their 

support throughout our tenure. We 

apologize for the short notice and 

Inconvenience this may have caused. 

Once again, Thank You All.” 

No additional information has 

been released about the closing.

BurgerFi first opened in 2013, 

moving into New York Pizza Depot’s 

former location under the University 

Towers apartment building at the 

corner of South University and Forest 

Streets. According to the restaurant’s 

website, it is part of a national 

franchise that began in 2011 and has 

been growing rapidly.

Students and locals were 

confused about the restaurant’s 

unexpected closing. Because there 

was lack of warning, customers were 

left wondering about the reason 

behind the shut-down.

LSA freshman Maria Ficaro is 

living in University Towers next year, 

and she was excited to have BurgerFi 

right under her apartment.

“I was looking forward to having 

all these food places close by, let alone 

right under me — like BurgerFi,” 

Ficaro said. “I’m confused on why 

they randomly shut down without 

giving an explanation. All of a sudden 

I walk by and there is a sign saying 

they closed down. Not cool.”

Business sophomore Maddie 

Demeter, a current University Towers 

resident, had a similar experience.

“Maybe two weeks ago, I was 

walking by and I saw (the sign),” 

Demeter said. “I was really surprised, 

the whole inside was empty. I hadn’t 

been in a while and I remember 

thinking I should go, and then it was 

closed! So I never got to go one last 

time.”

Demeter said she’s seen people 

walking in and out of the space 

since it closed, but the restaurant 

seems to be completely empty now. 

She’s hoping something new moves 

in, though she hasn’t heard about 

anything yet. 

“On South U, there are quite a 

few vacancies that need to be filled 

so I hope something comes soon,” 

she said.

musical performances.

“True Blue was really great,” 

Alcantara said. “That was one of 
the larger crowds I think I’ve ever 
performed in front of. ‘Glory’ felt 
particularly strong. It’s a great 
feeling when you perform a song 
and it goes over with the crowd as 
well as it did (that night).”

As Darren Criss, event emcee, 

took the stage, he reminded 
the audience of the University’s 
prevalence 
on 
Broadway. 
A 

2009 graduate, Criss achieved 
prominence on the hit TV show, 
“Glee,” where he portrayed an 
openly gay student and singer. He 
now stars in a national tour of the 
musical “Hedwig and The Angry 
Inch.”

“Every time I look to see a 

Broadway show, even without 
knowing it, there’s about an 80 
percent chance there are at least 
two Michigan graduates in it,” he 
said.

Criss’s hosting brought many 

students, such as LSA freshman 
Caylin Luebeck, to the event, who 
then found much more. 

“The show definitely surprised 

me — it included a lot more of 
a variety of performances than 
I expected,” Luebeck said “My 
favorite part, that’s hard. It was 
probably when the Men’s Glee 
Club sung ‘Glory’ from ‘Selma.’ It 
was a very powerful and moving 
performance.”

Parts of the show also included 

video interviews of alumni who 
fell in love at the University, a 
“Dear Squirrel” video about the 
squirrels on the Diag and a video 

tribute to notable University 
professors. There was even a 
segment highlighting the role of 
the Diag in students’ lives.

“Oh, the Diag,” Criss said. 

“Separation between Church and 
State. Literally, as in our streets.”

One such professor, Ralph 

Williams, an Arthur F. Thurnau 
Professor Emeritus of English, 
touched on how Ann Arbor acts as 
a place where people of all races, 
religions and backgrounds can 
come together and share their 
stories.

“The story of us not a single 

story, but the stories of all of us 
who have been part of its history,” 
Williams said. “Michigan belongs 
to us, and in a deep way, we belong 
to it. Being a part of its history 
expands each of us across the 
whole globe.”

Many 
of 
the 
University’s 

sports legends were also honored, 
including former NFL player 
Desmond Howard, Fab Five 
members Jimmy King and Ray 
Jackson, former basketball player 
Diane Dietz and former softball 
player Sierra Romero.

Michigan football coach Jim 

Harbaugh made an appearance as 
well, giving a speech referencing 
former Michigan football coach 
Bo 
Schembechler’s 
notable 

speech, “The Team.” Harbaugh 
spoke on improving race relations 
as well as the importance of 
remembering 
how 
everyone, 

regardless of background, is on 
the same team.

“Over the past century, the 

University 
has 
reformed 
its 

outlook on races relations and civil 
rights,” Harbaugh said. “True 
leadership is standing up behalf 
of the marginalized to always do 
what is right.”

James Toy, founder of the 

Spectrum 
Center, 
Muñoz 

and 
Douglas 
Scott, 
founder 

of Environmental Action for 
Survival, also spoke.

Scott 
graduated 
from 
the 

University in 1966 after years of 
participating in protests during 
his time at the University.

“As a graduate student in the 

School of Natural Resources 
(and Environment), I was one 
of the small group that decided 
to plan what became the largest 
environmental teach-in,” Scott 
said. “Once again, the University 
of Michigan led the way for 
American social progress.”

Muñoz, 
a 
third-generation 

Wolverine, has a long history at 
the University of Michigan in 
her family. Muñoz graduated in 
1984 and is the former director 
of White House Domestic Policy 
Council. 

“In all, the Muñoz family has 

had someone at Michigan every 
decade, for 100 years,” Muñoz 
said. “I grew up in the Detroit area 
in a nearly all white neighborhood. 
At Michigan, I learned firsthand 
about the positive impact of 
blending cultures.”

Right before the Michigan 

Marching 
Band 
broke 
into 

“Victors 
Valiant,” 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

closed the event with a speech 
referencing the University’s far-
reaching contributions to society, 
both on earth and in space.

“On this stage and all around the 

world, we see that the University’s 
stars are everywhere,” Schlissel 
said. “They’re succeeding in 
every discipline and pushing 
the frontiers of discovery and 
imagination into the night sky and 
beyond.”

TRUE BLUE
From Page 1A

Irwin justifies legalization by 

discussing the “failure” of the 
war on drugs, as he wrote in a 
Facebook post. In 2014 over 20,000 
arrests were made in Michigan for 
marijuana possession, a tally that 
Rabhi said is too high.

“The war on drugs has failed 

us,” Rabhi said. “It has cost us too 
many millions of taxpayers’ dollars 
locking up the wrong people.”

LSA junior Rowan Conybeare, 

chair of the University’s chapter of 
College Democrats agreed and said 
arrest doesn’t solve the institutional 

problems associated with crime.

“If Michigan were to legalize 

marijuana, 
it 
would 
prevent 

thousands of arrests for petty 
crimes, and help to end the 
cycle 
of 
disenfranchisement 

perpetuated by the criminal 
justice system.”

Additionally, though African 

Americans comprise only 14 
percent of Michigan’s population, 
35 percent of marijuana arrests 
were 
of 
African-American 

individuals. 
Rabhi 
said 
the 

disproportion is no coincidence.

“I’m here with you because the 

war on drugs is a race war,” Rabhi 
said. “It is a war against people of 
color.”

Merrill 
argued 
the 

enforcement of marijuana as 
illegal is inappropriately titled a 
“war” when, in reality, police are 
simply upholding what has been 
federally illegal for a long time.

“There 
is 
certainly 
an 

argument that marijuana is over 
classified and punishments for 
its use should not be as harsh, 
but there is no ‘war on drugs,’ ” 
Merrill said. “It has been the law 
for decades, and police simply 
enforce the law of the land rather 
than wage war on citizens for 
their drug use.”

Despite a canceled flight due to 
bad weather, Fauci delivered his 
lecture via video.

“If 
history 
has 
taught 

us anything, it’s that every 
administration 
is 
likely 
to 

experience an infectious disease 
crisis,” Fauci said.

Through his collaboration with 

presidential 
administrations, 

Fauci also noted the necessary 
elements to prevent and control 
an epidemic.

“We need global surveillance, 

transparency, 
infrastructure, 

clinical 
research 
cooperation 

and platforms for vaccines and 
drugs,” Fauci said, specifically 
emphasizing the need for a flu 
vaccine. “We’ve come to the 
time now where we must have a 
universal influenza vaccine.” 

Fauci ended his lecture by 

stating the title of a report he 
co-published nine years ago: 
“Emerging infections: a perpetual 
challenge.” He reasoned that, 
even in the medically advanced 
age of 2017, emerging infections 
and infectious diseases are still a 
“perpetual challenge.”

Dr. Paul Farmer, professor 

at 
Harvard 
University 
and 

co-founder and chief strategist 
of Partners in Health, was the 
keynote speaker for the 21st 
annual Robert Fekety Lecture.

Farmer drew on his experiences 

going abroad, specifically during 
the Ebola epidemic, to emphasize 
the importance of viewing serious 
illnesses and outbreaks from the 
point of view of the patient.

When he went to West Africa, 

Farmer noticed the shocking 
public health deserts, a term for 
places where minimal health 
infrastructures are in place. He 
also saw clinical deserts, meaning 
there 
were 
few 
caretakers 

available too, which contributed 
to the quick spread of Ebola, and 
the many resulting deaths.

“Liberia was a public health 

desert, which is why Ebola 
spread,” Farmer said. “It was also 
a clinical desert, which is why it 
killed.”

To prevent an outbreak like 

Ebola in the future, Farmer 
emphasized 
the 
need 
for 

sustainable health infrastructures 
that will balance public health, 
prevention and clinical care for 
treatment of patients.

“Responding 
to 
pandemics 

involves staff, stuff, space and 
systems for care as well as public 
health work,” he said. “We need 
to build academic medical centers 
in clinical deserts,” Farmer said. 
“We can’t just have public health 
fortresses.” 

The largest event on the 

convention agenda was a panel 
hosted 
by 
Gupta, 
featuring 

four health professionals with 
different areas of focus. 

Dr. Martin Cetron, director for 

the Division of Global Migration 
and Quarantine at the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 
set the tone for the conversation 
when he talked about the potential 
future of a pandemic.

“Outbreaks 
are 
inevitable, 

pandemics are optional,” he said, 
propelling the conversation into 
a discussion about pandemic 
preparedness and the role of the 
media in outbreaks.

Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, former 

director of the Detroit Health 
Department 
and 
University 

of 
Michigan 
alum, 
believes 

pandemic preparedness requires 
knowing when and how to start 
the process of taking action.

“Pandemic 
preparedness 

means 
being 
able 
to 
move 

information, people and supplies, 
and knowing when to set that in 
process,” he said.

The same difficulties health 

officials 
face 
with 
knowing 

how and when to categorize an 
epidemic as an outbreak applies 
to the media, according to New 
York Times reporter Donald 
McNeil. McNeil covers “plagues 
and pestilences” for the NYT and 
said the media has gotten better 
at knowing when it is appropriate 
to publish a story that will alert 
the world to a disease.

“You have to decide when 

to cover new outbreaks and 
when to drop everything else 
you’re doing,” McNeil said, also 
noting the media cannot always 
wait for the CDC or the World 
Health Organization to send out 
an alert. 

El-Sayed 
said 
these 

improvements in the media 
can help the public health 
community inform the world 
about a particular disease.

“Often, it’s hard for public 

health to act as it needs if there’s 
not media coverage of an issue,” 
El-Sayed said. “In an outbreak, 
communicate early and often, 
to everyone, and set values from 
the start.”

panels — one of which will be led by 
Ty Roberts, chief technology officer 
at UMG — throughout the day.

In addition to UMG’s features, the 

festival will also host activities such 
as Rap Cypher, yoga sessions on the 
Diag lawn, an MTank-led spinoff of 
the television show “Shark Tank” 
and a Bicentennial art installation 
that is to be painted throughout the 
day by current Art & Design seniors. 

MUSIC Matters is also working 
with project managers at both the 
Michigan League and the Michigan 
Union to find a permanent home for 
the installation afterward.

The festival’s main themes include 

arts, 
community, 
sustainability 

and social identity, with a variety 
of multicultural and sustainability-
focused student organizations being 
present throughout the festival. 
SpringFest will also feature a 
“Mental Health Zone” with support 
from both School of Nursing Student 
Government and the Wolverine 
Support Network.

MUSIC Matters will also be 

renewing their past food truck 
partnerships, with offerings from 
a variety of southeastern Michigan 
restaurants, including El Taco Veloz, 
Shimmy Shack and Detroit BBQ 
Company.

SpringFest’s 
evening 
concert 

will be taking place at the Crisler 
Center at 7:30 p.m. Proceeds from 
gate receipts will be going toward 
a University-hosted arts camp for 
Detroit youth this coming summer. 
Tickets start at $19.99 for students 
with valid UM IDs, and at $29.99 for 
the general public.

class this year was an exciting 
experience.

“I volunteered at FestiFools last 

year, and I thought it was really 
awesome and was bummed I 
didn’t take the class, so that’s why I 
registered for it this year as a second-
year LHSP student,” Minnebo said. 
“It was really cool being able to do 
art for art’s sake, while also being 
able to make a statement. A lot of 
the puppets this year were very 
political, so it was interesting to see 
how that came about.”

LSA freshman Alex Mullen 

came to the event to because he 
heard it was a fun occasion unique 
to Ann Arbor, and because he 
had friends participating in the 
festivities.

“I think it allows for really odd 

freedom of expression that you 
wouldn’t see in a lot of other places,” 
he said. “There’s some level of 

political commentary happening 
— there’re a lot of gaudy depictions 
of our current president and other 
political figures.”

Whether the designs were 

inspired by this year’s theme or by 
recent political occurrences, pieces 
such as a giant dog topped with 
Betsy DeVos’ head and Ann Arbor 
Mayor Christopher Taylor linking 
arms with his puppet doppelganger 
certainly turned heads at the event.

“Seeing the previous few years, 

I don’t know if it was every this 
overtly political,” Minnebo said. 
“I just wonder if it’s because of the 
time we’re in now or especially the 
town we’re in. A lot of the puppets 
were made that way — everybody 
wanted to make a Trump puppet 
and kind of take that on, and it was 
kind of encouraged, but to do it in 
a different and interesting way. I 
think it adds another layer to the 
parade.”

LSA sophomore Emily Miu 

participated in Festifools as well, 
and found it interesting that 
the public art was latent with 

underlying commentary. 

“This is a parade, it’s FestiFools 

and it’s about being foolish.” Miu 
said. “It doesn’t have to be political, 
but it still ended up having those 
themes, and that’s got to mean 
something, you know? I think it’s 
because a lot of art is inspired by 
passion, and what’s been happening 
around us to humanity and society 
has inspired a lot of passion in 
people who want to voice this.”

Ann Arbor resident Cara Rosaen 

said multiple factors came together 
to make FestiFools the experience 
it is, and she found the interactive, 
community-building 
aspects 

particularly interesting.

“We’ve lived here almost our 

entire lives and we’ve never been!” 
Rosaen said as she lifted her son 
onto her shoulders. “I actually got to 
see the place where all these statues 
and paper-mache things are kept, 
which is so cool. We saw them there, 
and then actually got to see them in 
action today. It’s colorful, silly, make 
believe and imaginative. This is a 
‘keep Ann Arbor weird’ moment!”

As of now, the University’s 

proposals for GSI and GSSA 
salaries and benefits do not 
appear to respect the value 
of 
their 
labor. 
Graduate 

students play a particularly 
tangible role in undergraduate 
education, often serving as 
a valuable link between a 
student’s desire to learn and 
achieving mastery in a subject 
by teaching small discussion 
sections 
that 
complement 

large lecture courses. GSIs 
alleviate much of the burden 
of 
grading 
and 
additional 

instructional 
hours 
that 

would otherwise fall on the 
backs of faculty. In addition 
to doing this labor, graduate 
students have coursework of 
their own to attend to, making 
it hard for them to find time 
to supplement their income 
through other jobs.

While 
the 
relationship 

between 
graduate 
students 

and the University is complex 
given their dual status as 
students 
and 
employees, 

our 
GSIs 
deserve 
better 

than an administration that 
refuses to recognize the need 
for substantial changes to 
accommodate 
rising 
costs 

of living. In exchange for 
their invaluable labor, part 

of what the members of GEO 
wish to gain is a raise of 17.5 
percent over three years to 
accommodate the increasing 
cost of living in Ann Arbor, a 
request to which, as of March 
15, the University responded 
with an offer of substantially 
less over the next three years. 

GEO is also seeking changes to 

graduate worker health benefits 
that cap the amount spent on 
copays for mental health services, 
which many graduate students 
seek out. Additionally, they urge 
the University to expand paid 
parental leave to be inclusive of 
all parents, not just birth parents, 
allowing graduate students to 
assist their newly grown families 
when they need it most. While 
reasonable negotiations are to 
be expected, we are seriously 
concerned that the University has 
not budged on its proposal for a 
meager increase in wages and 
other benefits.

Most 
troubling 
is 
the 

University’s outright refusal 
to negotiate on the issue of 
unionized diversity labor by 
graduate students. Payment 
for diversity work has been a 
major issue for many campus 
movements. 
The 
students 

the 
University 
constantly 

seeks 
out 
for 
input 
and 

labor 
on 
diversity 
issues 

are often the very students 
most 
disenfranchised 
by 

the current campus climate 
they’ve been tasked to help 
repair. Recent events have 
shown 
that 
addressing 

barriers to equity on campus 
isn’t easy for anyone. Asking 
graduate 
students 
whose 

time and wallets are already 
extraordinarily 
strained 

to spend time on diversity 
efforts 
without 
pay 
and 

unionization 
flies 
in 
the 

face of the principles the 
University 
claims 
went 

into the DEI plans. If the 
University is serious about 
implementing its DEI plan, 
it must pay for unionized 
diversity labor.

GSIs 
and 
GSSAs 
are 

integral 
to 
our 
campus’s 

continued 
functioning, 
yet 

the 
University’s 
attitude 

toward the current contract 
negotiations with the GEO 
have 
not 
recognized 
the 

serious struggles they face 
under the current contract. 
This 
bargaining 
period 

could have been a test for the 
University to put the principles 
of this year’s DEI plans into 
action. We’re not confident the 
University has passed.

T

he work required to 
make the University 
of Michigan campus a 

more diverse, more equitable 
and more inclusive community 
of scholars requires a long-
term 
commitment. 
That’s 

why, when we developed and 
launched our Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion strategic plan 
last fall, it was a five-year plan.

And, like with any plan of this 

magnitude and significance, 
there were immediate calls for 
us to do more and do it quicker. 
That’s a natural reaction.

But today I want to make 

sure 
that 
our 
community 

knows just how important 
this work is for all of us. It is 
so important that there is a 
team of more than 200 UM 
employees on the Ann Arbor 
campus who are devoting all or 
a portion of their professional 
lives to this work.

Additionally, 
there 
are 

countless numbers of faculty, 
staff and students across our 
campus who are assisting by 
sharing 
their 
experiences, 

offering 
their 
advice 
and 

volunteering their services in 
many different ways.

Student 
involvement 

in 
the 
DEI 
planning 
and 

implementation processes is 
critical. Many units across 
campus 
have 
involved 

undergraduate and graduate 
students in their work. My 
office has a student advisory 
board. The Division of Student 
Life has established two DEI 
Student Advisory Committees 
made up of 25 undergraduate 
and 
25 
graduate 
student 

volunteers. I recognize and value 
the historic and contemporary 
contributions made by students 
to the University’s progress with 
respect to both the DEI planning 
process 
and 
more 
broadly 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
over many years at the University. 

A fundamental motivation 

for creating a strategic plan was 
to make the unpaid DEI work 
of countless members of our 
community (including graduate 
students) the responsibility of 
the University.

That 
means 
the 
bulk 

of the day-to-day work of 
implementing the DEI plans 
across campus must fall to 
the faculty and staff who have 
been given the responsibility 
of DEI plan implementation 
and who are paid for that 
work. At the same time, we 
also recognize the personal, 
professional and educational 
benefits that being involved 
with DEI work provides. I have 
personally 
benefitted 
from 

them throughout my career.

To address the issue of the 

appropriate role for graduate 
students 
within 
the 
DEI 

strategic 
planning 
process, 

my office is working with a 
task force equally comprised 
of graduate students and DEI 
strategic plan implementation 
professionals. The task force 
will have two charges.

First, the task force will 

go through all the unit DEI 
plans 
and 
identify 
where 

unpaid 
graduate 
student 

work may exist. The task 
force will then recommend 
appropriate ways to address 
this work (including providing 
appropriate 
compensation). 

The work needs to be tasks 
for which graduate students 
are uniquely qualified to do 
or it should be done by faculty 
or staff. The work also should 
have some educational benefit 
to graduate students since they 
came to the University to get 
the best education possible.

The 
second 
charge 
of 

the task force is to identify 
existing 
opportunities 

within the plans as well as 
recommend new mechanisms 

by which graduate students 
with interest in DEI issues 
can gain valuable educational 
and professional development 
experiences with appropriate 
compensation. 
Possible 

examples include: a new DEI 
innovation 
fund; 
possible 

new 
Rackham 
Graduate 

School Diversity Allies grant 
supplements; 
internship 

opportunities 
through 

the 
National 
Center 
for 

Institutional Diversity and the 
Office of Diversity, Equity & 
Inclusion; as well as potential 
educational 
opportunities 

in other units across the 
University.

I am confident that this 

task 
force 
provides 
the 

best process to address the 
shared concern that graduate 
students, 
particularly 

under-represented 
graduate 

students, 
should 
not 

be 
required 
to 
perform 

uncompensated work within 
the DEI plan. It is a process 
that will include graduate 
students in designing their 
roles in the DEI plan. We also 
anticipate creating additional 
funding for graduate students 
to work in concert with the 
DEI plan that will provide 
graduate students important 
educational benefits.

Ultimately, the University 

is interested in fostering a 
supportive relationship with 
graduate students that is both 
mindful of their time and 
respectful 
of 
their 
efforts. 

Through these outlined actions, 
we believe that together we can 
achieve these goals.

FROM THE DAILY

We stand with our GSIs and GSSAs
T

he Graduate Employees’ Organization, the labor union that represents 
graduate student instructors and graduate student staff assistants 
at the University of Michigan, is in the process of negotiating a new 

contract for union members. GEO hopes the new contract will address issues 
of the rising cost of living in Ann Arbor, health care and diversity labor 
under the University’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion plan. The climate 
surrounding the negotiations has become more heated in recent weeks, with 
the union holding a number of protests, including a 400-person sit-in at the 
Fleming Administration Building. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board calls 
upon the University to support a contract that acknowledges the changes in 
cost of living and other benefit needs graduate students face since their last 
contract negotiation, and we implore the University to pay graduate students 
for diversity labor under their new contract. 

L

ast week, my best friends 
from home visited Ann 
Arbor because they have 

each 
dropped 
out 

of school to pursue 
music careers and, 
through a web of 
connections 
and 

mutual friends, they 
were 
given 
studio 

time in Detroit. So 
they 
would 
spend 

their days mostly in 
the city, and then 
come back here and 
hang out with me.

And while I was spending time 

with them, I realized, among other 
things, that I don’t feel very close 
to very many people in Ann Arbor. 
How could I? After all, I went to the 
same school from the time I was 3 
years old to when I graduated high 
school, so I’ve known many of 
the people who visited me for my 
entire waking life. Immediately 
once they arrived, the choice of 
whom to spend time with was 
abundantly 
clear: 
With 
my 

friends from home suddenly here, 
there was not really anybody else 
to be around.

And yet, I don’t think I saw as 

much of my friends from home 
as I could or as I wanted to. 
And this is because I do a lot of 
different things on this campus. 
I have two majors and a minor in 
three departments whose work 
and faculty members I respect 
enormously. I work with a lot of 
change-making 
organizations: 

the Prison Creative Arts Project, 
Students4Justice 
and 
the 

Program on Intergroup Relations, 
to name a few. I truly admire what 
these organizations stand for, and 
I am more than willing to help in 
any way I can.

In 
a 
Positive 
Psychology 

textbook referencing a 2002 
positive psychology study, the 
author notes that the investigators 
Ed Diener and Martin Seligman 
found that the most consistent, 
salient 
characteristic 
among 

people who scored the highest 
on a happiness survey was 
“their strong ties to friends 
and family and commitment to 
spending time with them.” This is 
something one of my friends from 
home pointed out to me while he 
was here.

And yet it’s something I’ve not 

thought about during my time 

at the University of Michigan. I 
think my way of understanding 
how to be happy at the University 

was to do the most 
things, to get most 
involved, as a means of 
leaving my mark on this 
campus as someone 
who tried to change all 
the fucked-up things 
that happen here.

Because, 
from 
its 

origins, this university 
is really unjust, both 
in its history and in 
the 
way 
in 
which 

the 
discourse 
surrounding 

that history takes shape, as the 
powerful 
Stumbling 
Blocks 

exhibit shows: This land was 
stolen from Native Americans, in 
part, with the understanding that 
Native children would be able to 
attend this school, and yet not a 
single Native American attended 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

during the next 130 years.

Today, at a school which is 

meant to represent the world 
in which we live and, I believe, 
the world in which we want 
to live, only 13.8 percent of 
the class of 2020 comes from 
underrepresented backgrounds. 
Despite these statistics, of course, 
the 
University 
brands 
itself 

as “Always Leading. Forever 
Valiant,” and it has made this 
year’s 
graduation 
ceremony 

one to explicitly celebrate the 
University’s history — fraught 
with discrimination — instead 
of inviting a dynamic speaker to 
help graduates construct a more 
egalitarian future.

The answer is not in celebrating 

our past. The answer is in 
interrogating our past relentlessly 
and brutally. Invite a Native 
American whose ancestors were 
lied to by University founders 
and administrators to speak to 
the class of 2017. Invite somebody 
whose ancestor was denied entry 
into this country by the Chinese 
Exclusion Act of 1892, drafted 
in part by former University 
President James Angell.

All of this — our past and the 

way we go about discussing it — 
is pathetic and inexcusable. And, 
as I type out these aspects of our 
University that I myself already 
know, I feel rancor boiling within 
me. I begin to look at students 
entering and exiting Mason Hall 

with this rancor attached to all 
of them, because I see them all 
as not doing anything about the 
deeply problematic aspects of 
this school. I see them only in the 
context of this; I see them as lazy, 
ungrateful, blind.

And so I work to change this 

campus by joining organizations. 
I will not become the blind, lazy 
idea of people that I sense all 
around me. But I’m not writing 
this just to say that. I’m writing 
to say that this work has not 
brought me happiness. My days 
are grossly routinized: wake 
up, 
homework, 
class, 
class, 

homework, 
meeting, 
dinner, 

sleep. I barely speak to people 
here — why would I, if I think of 
the average University student as 
complacent and fundamentally 
silent? I don’t laugh for extended 
periods of time here. “There is too 
much work to be done,” I think. 

Nor am I writing this to 

criticize the people in my life or 
the people on this campus. Not at 
all. I’m writing this as a certain 
diatribe against myself and the 
way in which I have lived on 
this campus. I have not worked 
to 
foster 
deep, 
long-lasting 

relationships. 
I 
have 
known 

people in meetings and lectures. I 
have not known people by taking 
walks with them and singing and 
dancing and playing Scrabble and 
Boggle with them.

Instead, I have seen people in 

this campus largely as products 
of this university’s history — 
the anger I feel toward the 
people around me, right now, 
just having recorded a few of 
the horrendous historic aspects 
of our University’s history — is 
proof of this. I am writing this, 
instead, to catalyze a shift in the 
way I see people here: not merely 
colleagues and peers, but people 
with stories and lives to share.

I’m reminded of a quote by 

the transcendent author Audre 
Lorde: “Caring for myself is 
not self-indulgence, it is self-
preservation.” I think I have 
somehow denied myself the 
ability 
of 
self-care, 
denied 

myself the time and space to 
create deep and long-lasting 
relationships, which are, I do 
believe, the key to happiness.

DAILY TV/NEW MEDIA COLUMN

A girl kills herself, leaving 
behind 13 cassette tapes

Understandably, 
a 
number 

of viewers have published their 
criticisms in the week since “13 
Reasons Why” premiered. In this 
piece from The Mighty, a website 
dedicated to publishing stories 
from people with serious health 
conditions, Alyse Ruriani explains 
her issues with the show, and with 
“Thirteen Reasons Why,” the novel 
on which it’s based.

I agree with some of Ruriani’s 

points; she mentions that the series 
doesn’t address mental illness’s 
role in suicide, which is a pretty 
glaring oversight considering “a 
mental disorder and/or substance 
abuse is found in 90% of suicide 
deaths.” At a time when so many 
people still don’t understand the 
nature of mental illness — that 
you don’t have to have quantifiable 
reasons why you’re suicidal, that 
you can be suicidal because mental 
illness attacks your mind just as 
clinically as physical illness attacks 
your body — it’s true that greater 
exposure to stories explicitly about 
mental illness are necessary.

Maybe it’s better to think of “13 

Reasons Why” not as a story about 
suicide, but a story about bullying. 
It’s not an entirely accurate 
portrayal of depression, with its 
cause-and-effect storytelling, but it 
does paint a devastating picture of 
how acts of bullying can pile up and 
build off each other, how relentless 
bullying can make a person believe 
they’re worthless. Organizations 
like The Trevor Project and It Gets 
Better exist for a reason.

But I also don’t think that even if 

“13 Reasons Why” was meant to be 
an accurate depiction of suicide, not 
every story about suicide needs to 
fit into that majority statistic. I don’t 
think “13 Reasons Why” is trying 
to pass itself off as the definitive 
portrait of depression and suicide. 
Can’t this just be a story about one 
girl and what drove her to suicide? 
Do we have to expect it to fit into all 
of our preconceived notions about 
why things like this traditionally 
happen?

Besides, though “13 Reasons 

Why” 
rarely 
explicitly 

acknowledges mental illness (it’s 
mentioned that Clay used to take 
pills and see a therapist, but that’s 
mostly just hinted at), it never 
outright dismisses the possibility of 

Hannah having clinical depression. 
Perhaps this is simply a story with 
uninformed characters, a story full 
of people determined to scapegoat, 
to find someone to blame instead 
of accepting that not everything is 
easily explainable.

That might seem like a cop-out, 

to suggest that it’s not the show 
that’s ignorant but the characters, 
but there’s evidence for it. “13 
Reasons Why” is frequently self-
aware in ways that people overlook.

There’s one scene in particular, 

in the final episode of the series, 
that illustrates this beautifully. 
The two main characters, Hannah 
and Clay, each sit down with their 
guidance counselor, Mr. Porter, 
at different times. Director Kyle 
Patrick Alvarez (“The Stanford 
Prison 
Experiment”) 
toggles 

back and forth between these 
two conversations, showing us 

Hannah’s final attempt to seek help 
at the same time that he shows us 
Clay confronting Mr. Porter with 
his failure to save her.

“13 Reasons Why” — which, it 

must be said, isn’t a great show, 
though it’s often quite a good one — 
paints Clay a little too frequently as 
the hero. That continues in the final 
episode, as he walks Mr. Porter 
through the final day of Hannah’s 
life, showing him that it was his 
negligence that led to Hannah’s 
final decision to kill herself.

And it’s true: We watch Mr. 

Porter’s session with Hannah, and 
we see him repeatedly stumble. 
When Hannah admits she was 
raped, he reveals his simplistic 
view of sexual assault, subtly 
victim-blaming by suggesting that 
if Hannah didn’t explicitly tell her 
rapist to stop, she must’ve initially 
consented then changed her mind. 
He repeatedly tries to rush her into 
an explanation for her feelings, 
then rushes her into revealing the 

identity of her rapist. Finally, he 
sets up a false dichotomy: Hannah 
must either press charges and 
directly confront Bryce, or “move 
on.”

What makes the sequence a 

great one, though, is that Mr. Porter 
isn’t a bad person. He’s probably a 
poorly trained counselor, but he 
recognizes his mistakes, and he 
sometimes says the right things. 
When Hannah asks him if he can 
promise Bryce will go to jail, he 
says, “I can’t promise you that, 
Hannah. But I will promise you 
this: I will do everything in my 
power to keep you safe and protect 
you in this process.”

While 
the 
series 
generally 

positions Clay as the hero of the 
narrative, the righteous avenger 
seeking justice for Hannah by 
confronting her bullies, Mr. Porter 
makes some good points in this 
scene. “Whatever happened to 
Hannah, between you and her, 
with other kids, she made that 
choice to take her own life,” he says. 
Later, when Clay suggests people 
should try to do better, Mr. Porter 
says, “We can try to love each other 
better, but we’re imperfect people. 
We love imperfectly, we don’t 
always get it right … you can know 
all the signs and understand the 
issues and still come out missing 
something.”

In that moment, the show’s true 

philosophy comes out. “13 Reasons 
Why” isn’t suggesting that there 
were 13 individual reasons Hannah 
killed herself, even if Hannah 
suggests that. In the wake of loss, 
everyone searches for closure, 
for some reason to explain how 
something so tragic could happen. 
Just because the characters of “13 
Reasons Why” never seriously 
consider mental illness as the sole 
cause for Hannah’s hopelessness 
doesn’t mean the show itself 
endorses that point of view.

In 
the 
end, 
“13 
Reasons 

Why” subverts its own title, 
acknowledging that people are 
essentially unknowable. Maybe 
Clay, or Mr. Porter, or anyone 
could’ve prevented Hannah from 
resorting to suicide. What’s even 
more terrifying, what few of the 
characters consider, is that maybe 
there was nothing they could’ve 
done.

ALBUM REVIEW

Future Islands returns 
with stunning ‘Far Field’

On their fifth LP, Future Islands evokes beauty and expanse

Three 
years 
since 
their 

breakthrough album Singles, 
an album “of singles” that 
flexed about as much as the 
title might suggest, Future 
Islands have returned with 
their fifth LP, The Far Field. 
Hailing 
from 
Baltimore, 

Maryland, 
the 
three-piece 

have been committed to their 
particular 
brand 
of 
hard-

edged synth-pop revival for 
over 11 years. The Far Field is 
a stunning summation of this 
dedication and experience, and 
perhaps the most linear record 
in the band’s discography. 
Future Islands regularly tours 
with drummer Michael Lowry, 
but recruited him to play for 
the studio recordings this time 
around, lending the album 
a greater sense of direction. 
Despite the relatively boring 
“Candles,” 
The 
Far 
Field 

delivers on the promise that 
Future 
Islands 
made 
with 

Singles in 2014: a purposeful 
step 
towards 
accessibility 

without compromise of the 
band’s core values.

Singles “Ran” and “Cave” 

signal 
urgency, 
frontman 

and vocalist Sam Herring’s 
familiarly hearty rasp soaring 
over 
fast 
footstep-like 

cymbals. In the music video 
for “Ran,” Herring, fittingly, 
runs 
across 
a 
countryside 

before closing out the last 
minute crooning from behind 
dancing embers. Like Future 
Islands’ 
live 
performances, 

Herring’s face contorts itself, 
the visible strain in his brow 
evidence of his earnestness, an 
earnestness perhaps even more 
central to the band’s identity 
than Herring’s voice.

Although The Far Field is 

stylistically distinct from the 
rest of the group’s releases, it 
is also, in some ways, a return 
to form. On the lyric sheet 
included with the vinyl edition 
of the album, just below the 
list of acknowledgments, is 
a small note that the album’s 

title was inspired by Theodore 
Roethke’s poem of the same 
name, itself the fifth in a 
series titled “North American 
Sequence.” The poem informs 
not just the album’s themes, but 
the band’s mission statement.

“I learned not to fear infinity 

/ The far field, the windy cliffs 
of forever / The dying of time 
in the white light of tomorrow 
/ The wheel turning away from 
itself / The sprawl of the wave 
/ The on-coming water.” So 
ends the second part of “The 
Far Field,” evoking images of 
vastness, the same way The Far 
Field does with its 
soaring 
quality 

and 
occasional 

slow builds, from 
individuality 
to 
infinity. 
In 

Evening 
Air, 

Future 
Islands’ 

second 
album, 

was 
similarly 

inspired 
by 
a 

Roethke poem. (The artwork 
for both albums was also done 
by the same artist, Kymia 
Nawab.) Practically, the effect 
here is almost insignificant, 
but the connection does bring 
a greater sense of purpose and 
cohesion to the band’s work.

The 
opening 
track, 

“Aladdin,” rises out of nothing 
with a fade-in that will have 
you wondering for a moment 
whether you actually clicked 
play. The sort of detail that 
reveals its importance over 
listens, this fade-in is an 
indicator of Future Islands’ 
commitment to a theme. It 
makes sense that an album 
that confronts the relationship 
between the finite and the 
infinite must become slowly, 
from nothing, as did man. 
Where Roethke is “renewed by 
death, thought of [his] death, 
/ The dry scent of a dying 
garden in September,” Herring 
struggles, on “Cave”: “Is this 
a desperate wish for dying? / 
Or a wish that dying cease? / 
The fear that keeps me going 
and going and going / Is the 
same fear that brings me to my 
knees.” What’s more, Roethke’s 

“dying garden” is reflected 
in the roses (“Through the 
Roses,” “Black Rose”) of The 
Far Field. “Through the Roses” 
struggles with reconciling the 
highs and lows of life, before 
the 
chorus’s 
proclamation 

that “It’s not easy, just being 
human.”

Though 
keyboardist 

Gerrit 
Welmers’s 
and 

bassist 
William 
Cashion’s 

arrangements are expansive 
and 
sprawling, 
Herring’s 

accompanying 
narratives 

are 
often 
autobiographical 

in nature. “Black Rose” finds 

Herring wishing 
for 
another 

chance 
at 
love 

with a particular 
significant other, 
while 
“Beauty 

of 
the 
Road” 

is 
similar 
in 

thought and the 
most 
pointedly 

autobiographical, 

opening with the lines: “Left 
out on the road eight years ago 
/ And you left too but I never 
really thought you would go.”

On The Far Field, lyrical and 

stylistic decisions juxtapose 
the singular man and the 
expansiveness 
of 
being, 

continuing 
Future 
Islands’ 

obsession — a welcome one — 
with nature. All of the band’s 
album titles, save Singles, refer 
to nature (Wave Like Home, 
In Evening Air, On The Water, 
The Far Field) and mentions 
of blizzards, gardens, fire, 
rain and the overwhelming 
power of water are sprinkled 
throughout the album. The 
album’s only duet, “Shadows,” 
even invokes religion, with 
mentions of Dante and the 
Garden of Eden that further 
contextualize the experience 
of the individual. Masterfully 
creating a space both large 
enough to lose yourself in and 
simultaneously small enough 
that you may just see what 
looks 
like 
your 
reflection, 

peering back out at you, The 
Far Field leaves us with one 
final suggestion: “All finite 
things reveal infinitude.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Directed by Olivier Assayas 

(“Clouds of Sils Maria”), “Personal 
Shopper” is the story of Maureen 
(Kristen 
Stewart, 
“Certain 

Women”), an American expat 
living in Paris and working for 
a wealthy model as a personal 
shopper and assistant. Maureen 
is grappling with the recent death 
of her twin brother, Lewis, of 
a genetic heart condition. The 
siblings believed that they both had 
connections to the spirit world, so 
after his death, Maureen believes 
Lewis is attempting to contact her 
from beyond the grave. She also 
begins receiving messages from an 
unknown number, someone who 
knows intimate details of her life, 
and is strangely transfixed by them.

The film is difficult to categorize. 

It’s at once a tense psychological 
thriller, an understated exploration 
of grief and loneliness and a horror 
movie. Really, the film is a study 
in tonal shifts, some of which 
are more effective than others. 
Assayas attempts to balance these 
shifts by grounding the story in a 
kind of bland, muted affectation 
that encompasses the entire film. 
Characters speak at a low mumble, 
the visuals are bleak and graded 
grey, the edits are slow and blunt. 

The result is a deceptively simple 
surface that hides just how much is 
happening tonally and within the 
internal lives of the characters.

“Personal Shopper” takes a 

rather unconventional and tricky 
approach to storytelling. At a quick 
glance, it may appear meandering 
and plotless, but in reality, all of the 
drama happens within Stewart’s 
Maureen. It’s tightly focused on 
tracking her emotional progression 
as she tries to grapple with all of 
these feelings, which Stewart, 
who thrives in muted tones 
and 
understated 

characters, conveys 
in 
a 
brilliant 

performance. 
Maureen is a truly 
perfect 
character 

for Stewart — the kind of person 
whose stony and careful exterior is 
just a fragile cover for the deep well 
of feelings underneath.

Despite 
Stewart’s 
strength 

as 
an 
actress 
and 
Assayas’s 

clear understanding of plot and 
character mechanics, “Personal 
Shopper” is, well, a bit of a slog 
to get through. For one thing, it’s 
self-indulgent: For example, about 
halfway through the film, we’re 
treated to a nearly ten-minute 
sequence of Maureen anxiously 
answering and receiving texts 
from the unknown number on a 
train, mostly shot in tight shots of 

the phone itself. It’s so long and 
slow that you can’t help thinking 
there had to have been a better way 
to convey this information.

Even though its drama is well-

articulated through a carefully 
considered character arc, the movie 
still feels slow and meandering. It 
seems more concerned with being 
artful than with being empathetic. 
That is, there are some moments 
of genuine tension in the movie, 
but those moments are few and 
far between. We’re left with 
watching a character experience 

a lot of emotions, 
but nothing in the 
story apart from the 
character 
herself 

exists to enhance 
those 
feelings. 
I 

don’t suppose that it’s a particularly 
bad thing for a story to rely on an 
actor’s performance, but “Personal 
Shopper” would be absolutely 
nothing 
if 
not 
for 
Stewart’s 

charisma. There are no external 
conflicts, no ways for the audience 
to feel what Maureen is feeling — 
only ways for us to see it. To make 
a story resonate, storytellers need 
to work a lot harder than simply 
telling us what happened. As it 
stands, “Personal Shopper” gives 
its audience no reason to care. It’s 
a shame, too — it could have been 
beautiful.

‘Pure’ a big undertaking 
that brings mixed results

Father John Misty returns with poetic brilliance and pretension

Two years ago, Father John 

Misty (originally known as Josh 
Tillman) proved his worth with I 
Love You, Honeybear. The album 
was a fully formed and emotional 
follow-up to Fear Fun, his first 
enterprise as “Father John Misty” 
since parting ways with the Fleet 
Foxes. Misty’s newest release, 
Pure Comedy, is less musically 
interesting than most of what he 
has done up until this point, but 
it has enough lyrical substance 
to keep his fan base happily 
questioning 
the 
meaning 
of 

life and mulling over the many 
shortcomings of humanity for as 
long as they please.

Pure Comedy starts off on a 

strong note. “Total Entertainment 
Forever” stands out in particular, 
calling into question the creepily 
dominant role that technology 
has come to play in our lives. The 
song approaches the subject from 
an eerie angle, and closes off with 
a strong stanza predicting how 
someday historians will find us “In 
our homes / Plugged into our hubs 
/ Skin and bones / A frozen smile 
on every face.” The closing line, 
“This must have been a wonderful 
place,” hammers in the sinking 
feeling that the rest of the song has 
been building up: the sense that 
our elaborate technologies are only 
keeping us busy and distracted, 
while history trickles away all 
around us.

Pure Comedy sees its strongest 

moments when it is exploring 
messages like this, and to be 
fair, the album does a lot of 
exploring. 
Questions 
of 
the 

validity of millennial life and 
the pervasiveness of corruption 
ebb and flow through songs like 
“Things It Would Have Been 
Helpful to Know Before the 
Revolution,” “Birdie” and “Two 

Wildly Different Perspectives,” 
and 
manifest 
in 
their 
most 

memorable form in “Leaving 
LA,” a thirteen-minute-long self-
described “diatribe” that sums up a 
lot of the main points of the album. 
It’s melodically repetitive and 
doesn’t quite need to be thirteen 
minutes long, but it does include 
some striking and well-crafted 
scenes, like a van cruising past 
commercial billboards on its way 
out of L.A., and a child (presumably 
the young Misty) choking on a 
piece of watermelon candy in a 
JCPenney.

For all of Misty’s 

lyrical 
passion, 

he 
sometimes 

overshoots 
his 

target. Not all of his 
insights are exactly 
revelations; 
in 

“When the God of Love Returns,” 
for instance, he remarks on how 
the true hell is human nature, 
and how “this place is savage and 
unjust,” both of which are fair 
messages, although not really 
new ones. In addition, “Ballad 
of a Dying Man” notes how we 
leave this world “as clueless as we 
came,” at the end of a song that 
aligns Misty’s perspective with 
that of a dying man, even though 
he likely has never been one. Misty 
is an intelligent songwriter, but 
he can get carried away with his 
own language, just enough that it 
fails slightly to match up with a lot 
of the substance that would have 
been behind it.

The album also doesn’t take on 

very much in the way of melodic 
experimentation. Misty proved in 
I Love You, Honeybear that he was 
able to explore musically within 
an album, and there are ways in 
which he tries to take this in a new 
direction on Pure Comedy. “Birdie” 
makes for a cool, synthetic blend 
of styles, featuring electronics, 
piano and echoey vocals, and “The 
Memo” features an interesting 

change 
in 
tone 
toward 
the 

end of the song, as well as the 
incorporation of automated voices. 
The penultimate track, “So I’m 
Growing Old on Magic Mountain,” 
also finds a gentle, artful tone 
with which to start closing off the 
album. However, since the album 
starts out with some variety and 
then regains its depth toward the 
end, it would have been nice to see 
more inventiveness throughout its 
duration. This is true in particular 
because Misty so clearly fashions 
the journey of the album as a 

sort of Odyssean 
exploration 
of 

the 
experience 

of humanity, and 
since humanity can 
look like so many 
different things, the 
music of the album 

could have reflected some more 
variety.

Misty clearly understood the 

gravity of his undertaking, since 
the album is nearly an hour and 
fifteen minutes long. He genuinely 
wanted to make sure that he 
was successfully saying what he 
wanted to say with Pure Comedy, 
and really, this is when it all comes 
down to the listener. Misty indulges 
himself in going a little overboard 
with his own language, and an 
album that tries so hard to impress 
lyrically could have benefited 
from a little more attention to the 
innovative potential of the music 
itself. However, he clearly cares 
about the messages he is trying to 
get across in terms of consumer 
culture and general reliance upon 
entertainment, and this sentiment 
does come through in his lyrics. In 
spite of the album’s shortcomings, 
anyone who is already a fan of 
Misty’s poetic habits and the less 
romantic, more philosophical side 
of his songwriting will find at least 
a few key messages to appreciate in 
Pure Comedy.

Where women play a role 
in the gender-bent theatre

Writer Eli Rallo explores the blurring lines of gender and theatre

The future of the world is 

female. The future of art is female. 
The future of theatre is female.

When I was a naive eight-

year-old interested in theatre and 
music, my parents enrolled me in 
a theatre program at a local dance 
studio. We were doing “Hairspray 
Jr.” and did not have enough boys 
in the cast. Because of this, I was 
cast as the charismatic, titular 
male host of the “Corny Collins 
Show,” Corny Collins. In the 

world of theatre, this is called 
“genderbending.” 
Genderbent 

casting occurs in one of two ways: 
Either the role is changed to suit 
the gender of the actor or the actor 
plays the opposite gender.

In my case, at eight years old, I 

was playing the opposite gender 
— slicked back hair, a tiny suit, 
Converse high tops, and I looked 
like, well, a little boy. At this age, 
I didn’t have the mental capacity 
to 
really 
think 
about 
what 

genderbent casting meant and 
how conversations about gender 
have really made a home in the 
theatre. However, as I’ve grown 

up, thinking about that moment in 
my life — in which I took on a male 
role without a single comment 
or complaint — has led me to 
discover an interest with gender 
and casting in the theatre.

Genderbent 
theatre 
casting 

began in the time of Shakespeare, 
when women were not a part of 
theatre, which led to men dressing 
in women’s clothes and playing 
the female roles. It is so intriguing 
to me that one of the most 
liberating forms of expression was 
once confined to the patriarchy in 
a completely nonsensical way.

As as kid, I was playing a 

male role because the director 
had no choice. But now, as an 
eighteen-year-old in a constantly 
progressing world, the choice to 
have a woman occupy a historically 
male role defies an array of norms. 
It provides for thought-provoking 
conversation; it is not just a choice 
made out of necessity, but for a 
myriad of other reasons.

Today, it is becoming more 

common to see women playing 
male roles as social criticism or 
artistic choice by the director of 
the piece. To me, it is stunning 
and important to see a female 
“Hamlet” 
(Diane 
Venora 
in 

Joseph Papp’s adaptation), a role 
originally created to be played 
by a male. Seeing a female as this 
strong leading character changes 
the message of the show and 
provides a new context to its well-

known plot. 

There has been controversy 

surrounding genderbent casting 
for years. The best example of this 
can be found through the original 
1954 Broadway production of the 
musical “Peter Pan.”

Ever since Mary Martin took 

the stage as the iconic lead role, 
women have been cast as Peter. 
This raises the debate whether 
the cross-gender casting of Peter 
Pan reflects the movement toward 
equality of women in society or 
if it reflects the old concept that 
suggests a boy who is effeminate 
and can’t grow up has to be played 
by a female.

Due to these controversies, 

greater than just the necessity 
for more gender bent casting 
in professional theatre is the 
necessity for more strong, resilient 

female lead roles. If the world sees 
an array of female characters in 
theatre holding important jobs, 
carrying big decisions and being 
the catalyst for action instead of 
timid stock characters or damsels 
in distress, there may be no need 
to bend male roles to make social 
statements.

Until the theatre community 

recognizes the power of a female 
driven plot or a female lead, 
directors must continue to look 
at casting in a way that seeks 
to inspire the female, not leave 
her to the same types of roles 
she is “expected” to play. This 
genderbent style of casting seeks 
to show the audience that women 
can do anything men can do.

Wolverines’ offense sputters against Ohio State, Michigan 

fails to maintain perfect conference record in Columbus

Michigan’s ninth inning comeback effort falls short, Wolverines’ 

nine-game winning streak is snapped by the Fighting Illini

The fairytale script was there.
Down 9-7 in the ninth inning, 

with two men on, two men out and 
a 2-2 count, junior third baseman 
Drew Lugbauer launched a ball 
deep to left field.

The 
crowd 
erupted, 

anticipating a walk off three-

run home run – only to watch the 

ball drift foul.
The strong winds kept the ball 

from staying fair. On most other days, 

that shot would have been gone.

The very next pitch, Lugbauer 
struck out. 

“You’re not always going to 
get the fairy tale ending,” said 

junior 
right-hander 
Alec 

Rennard.

The loss marked the 
lone blemish for the No. 

18 Michigan baseball 

team (6-3 Big Ten, 

25-7 overall) in 

its 
three-game 

series against 

Illinois (1-5, 

11-18) – the 

defeat 

snapped a nine-game win streak from 
the Wolverines.

Similar to the first game of the series, 

the Fighting Illini got on the scoreboard 
early Sunday.

In the top of the second inning, Illinois 

managed three runs with only one ball 
leaving the infield. After a leadoff single 
by right fielder Jack Yalowitz, Michigan 
junior left-hander Michael Hendrickson 
loaded the bases with a hit by pitch and 
a walk.

Then, third baseman Trent Hammond 

bunted down the third baseline. The 
ball was fielded by Hendrickson, whose 
throw bounced in front of junior first 
baseman Jake Bivens and slipped past 
him to the wall – allowing two runs to 
score. Two at-bats later, the Fighting 
Illini added another run on a fielder’s 
choice, giving them a 3-0 lead.

The following inning, Michigan’s 

woes continued when Illinois left fielder 
Dan Rowbottom hit a three-run home 
run.

Hendrickson’s outing ended after 

that homer. In 2.1 innings, he allowed 
two walks, six hits and six runs (three 
earned) – the most runs the lefty has 
given up on the season.

The 
Wolverines 
had 
allowed 
16 

combined runs in the first three innings 
of their last four games.

“Our mindset has consistently been 

good to start each game,” said Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich. “But for whatever 
reason, we weren’t as sharp (in) three of 
the four games this week.”

Despite being down by six, the 

Wolverines responded quickly, cutting 
the deficit to two with four runs in the 
bottom of the third.

With 
the 
bases 
loaded, 
senior 

centerfielder Johnny Slater hit a single 
to 
right 
field, 
scoring 
sophomore 

designated hitter Nick Poirier and 
sophomore 
right 
fielder 
Jonathan 

Engelmann. Two at-bats later, with an 
0-2 count, Lugbauer belted the ball to 
right field for a double, adding two more 
runs.

In the fifth, Michigan scored another 

run as sophomore second baseman Ako 
Thomas advanced home following a wild 
pitch. But the Fighting Illini picked that 
run back up in the seventh off a double by 
second baseman Michael Massey.

However, it could have been a much 

worse inning for the Wolverines. With 
men on second and third and no outs, 
senior right-hander Mac Lozer and 
freshman left-hander Tommy Henry 
escaped the jam with two strikeouts and 
a ground-out.

In the bottom of the eighth, Michigan 

had 
a 
comeback 
opportunity 
with 

runners on first and second. But the 
Wolverines were unable to capitalize, 
leaving both men on base. On the day, 
Michigan stranded eight runners. 

HUNTER SHARF

Going into its final game of the series against 

Ohio State on Sunday, the Michigan softball 
team was riding a 14-game win streak. Only one 
day earlier, it blasted 26 hits in a doubleheader, 
symbolic of a swelling offense that had found its 
rhythm. It was invincible so far against Big Ten 
competition. 

The Wolverines had been making it look easy.
But that didn’t mean that it always would be 

easy. And Sunday shed light on that.

In its first time being shutout in over a month, 

No. 18 Michigan (8-1 Big Ten, 28-8-1 overall) 
fell, 5-0, at the hands of its conference rival, 
the 25th-ranked Buckeyes (7-2, 23-9). Though 
the Wolverines took the series with consecutive 
victories Saturday, they left Columbus with 

their previously perfect conference record 

gone.

“Today wasn’t easy,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “We get our 

toughness when things don’t go our 

way, not just when things go our way. 

And we need to be tougher when 

things aren’t going our way.”

In a storyline that seems all 
too familiar for Michigan this 

season, it left eight runners 

stranded on base Sunday, 

finding just three hits on the day. For a team 
seeing so many wins as of late, this problem 
may be easy to overlook, but it has continued to 
plague the Wolverines all season.

With a solo home run in the bottom of the third 

inning, Ohio State took a 1-0 lead that Michigan 
would not be able to recover from. In the fifth 
inning, the Buckeyes sealed the deal under 
pressure, picking up four additional runs with 
two outs on the board. The offensive surge led to 
the removal of senior right-hander Megan Betsa 
from the circle, putting junior right-hander Tera 
Blanco in her place to finish the game.

The Wolverines saw their best scoring 

opportunity in the final inning with two outs 
and bases loaded. But they couldn’t capitalize, 
stranding all three runners and ending the game.

Hutchins was less than pleased with the day’s 

performance.

“We had so many poor at-bats,” Hutchins said. 

“We swung at poor pitches and we didn’t have 
anybody step up and give us confidence in our 
lineup.”

But that’s not to say Ohio State’s sole victory on 

the weekend wasn’t well deserved. The Buckeyes 
had triple the number of hits as Michigan and 
stayed dominant in the circle as well.

Ohio State’s right-hander Shelby McCombs — 

the 
third-best 

pitcher 
in 
the 

Big Ten, according 
to 
earned-run 

average — commanded 
the 
circle 
with 
10 

strikeouts, 
neutralizing 

the Wolverines’ offensive 
efforts throughout the day.

“I 
thought 
Shelby 

McCombs 
was 
outstanding 

today,” Hutchins said. “She threw a 
great game against us and she built 
on her confidence. Her presence kept 
getting better and better. But again, when 
you’re facing good pitching you have to 
counter it. And we really just played into 
her game. It was her win.”

However, Saturday’s story was much 

different.

In the pair of games, Michigan outshined 

the Buckeyes across the board.

Seven separate Wolverines pounded out hits 

in both games, contributing to 13 total RBI on 
the day. Senior shortstop Abby Ramirez and 
junior first baseman Aidan Falk registered four 
hits apiece, with Falk bringing in four RBI.

A starter, a walk-on and a prayer

A

ndrew Robinson’s house 
was on State Street, and 
Dymonte Thomas’ was 

right behind it on White Street. 
So last sum-
mer, as the 
two were in 
Ann Arbor 
preparing for 
the Michigan 
football sea-
son, Thomas 
was always 
cutting 
through Rob-
inson’s yard.

Whenever Thomas went 

anywhere, he walked down 
Robinson’s driveway, and then, 
because he’s Dymonte Thomas, 
“next thing you know we’d see 
him in our living room, just 
saying ‘What’s up?’ and stuff,” 
Robinson said.

That’s how the bond formed 

between the two men who 
shared almost nothing except a 
yard and a football team. Their 
friendship developed in the com-
ing months, after softball games 
and bowling outings and Thurs-
day night Pizza House dinners 
along with kicker Ryan Tice.

And then Thomas and 

Robinson blinked, and it was 
around 2:30 p.m. on Nov. 19, 
2016, about an hour before 
kickoff of Thomas’ last game 
at Michigan Stadium. So as 
warmups proceeded around 
them, the two did what they 
always do at that time on Sat-
urdays: They met in the north 
end zone, took a knee, locked 
arms and prayed.

***

College football gets 

stressful, Robinson notes. 
So it’s good for him to have 
a “jokester” on the team like 
Thomas, who could walk into 
the locker room, crack a joke 
and lighten spirits.

“He is the way I am,” Thom-

as said. “I don’t know, it was 
just one of those friendships 

that you have where you just 
automatically connect really 
well.”

That’s how the friendship 

developed between the two, 
by playful ribbing. Robinson’s 
younger brother would come 
visit, and Thomas would say to 
him, “Oh, the better Robinson’s 
here. When are you going to 
come here and take your broth-
er’s spot?” Thomas would drop 
an interception, and Robinson 
would tease, “That’s what you 
get for not having hands.”

Their football careers have 

almost nothing in common. 
When they prayed together 
last year, Thomas was a senior 
starting safety, Robinson a 
redshirt sophomore backup 
long snapper. Thomas could be 
an NFL Draft pick later this 

month; Robinson will never 
have that opportunity.

Thomas was a four-star 

recruit in 2013, the No. 71 
recruit in the nation and the 
No. 9 safety according to 
247sports.com. He chose Mich-
igan over Ohio State and Notre 
Dame. Robinson had to send 
out his game film in order to 
receive a visit from Michigan. 
He picked the Wolverines over 
Ohio and Grand Valley State.

But the two shared some 

connections — family was 
important to both, as was 
religion. Thomas used to pray 
before games with reserve 
cornerback Terry Richardson, 
who played at Michigan from 
2012 to 2015. After Richard-
son graduated and transferred 
to Marshall, Robinson asked 

Thomas before last season’s 
opener against Hawaii if he 
could pray with him during 
warmups.

The free moment always 

came after Thomas finished 
stretching with the return 
men, and Robinson finished 
practicing with the kickers. 
Thomas would flag Robinson 
down — “I wouldn’t pray with-
out Andrew,” he said — and the 
two found a brief moment of 
peace before the chaos started.

Thomas typically led. He 

fought nagging injuries, so he’d 
pray for health. He’d pray for 
Robinson to perform his job 
if called upon. He’d pray for 
either to be able to bounce back 
if Thomas dropped an inter-
ception or Robinson botched 
a snap.

After the prayer, Robinson 

would give Thomas a pep talk. 
The message, in Thomas’ mem-
ory: Show why you’re one of 
the best safeties around. Domi-
nate the day. Know that God’s 
got your back, and he’s going to 
protect you.

After they finished, they 

stood up and hugged in a long 
embrace, and then they resumed 
their football duties. They did 
not skip a prayer last season.

***

Once last season, Robinson’s 

mother told him she saw a fan 
tearing up in the front row 
watching the weekly prayer. 
The Wolverines pray as a team 
before every game, but Thomas 
and Robinson also enjoyed the 
chance to make their ritual 
public. 

“I look back at life and real-

ize how blessed I am,” Thomas 
said. “I think it’s the right 
thing to do to give God credit, 
not only in silence but in front 
of people as well.”

Thomas graduated in 

December and is spending his 
final months in Ann Arbor 
training and preparing for 
the NFL. His Michigan career 
finished strong, yet as he looks 
back, the prayer meant most to 
him in the toughest times. His 
first season, he played defense 
in just three games and fin-
ished with seven tackles. He 
had to soak up the playbook 
and adjust to his college stud-
ies.

“When you go through 

(adversity) and some things 
that just don’t go your way, I 
won’t necessarily say you get 
away from God, but you kind 
of focus on trying to get better 
at whatever you’re struggling 
at,” Thomas said. “…At first, 
it was just hard, and I felt like 
God was leaving me, but then 
Andrew helped me realize that 
I can get through anything 
with God, and God’s never 
going to let me walk down a 
path by myself. He will always 
be there for me.”

As for Robinson, football 

returns to Michigan Stadium 
on Saturday for the annual 
Spring Game, and Thomas 
won’t be there waiting in the 
end zone.

Robinson has thought about 

what will happen then and 
thinks for now that he will 
pray by himself, until he and 
someone else find the same 
connection. When they do, 
watch for them. They’ll be in 
the same end zone, under the 
same goalposts, arm in arm, 
around noon.

Michigan surrenders early lead to Blue Jays

For 
three 
minutes 
on 

Saturday in Baltimore, the 
Michigan 
women’s 
lacrosse 

team was sitting pretty.

Senior 
midfielder 
Kim 

Coughlan put the Wolverines 
(1-3 Big Ten, 5-10 overall) on the 
board two 
minutes 
into 
the 

contest. 
Thirty seconds later, senior 
attackman 
Jess 
Angerman 

found the back of the net, and 
Michigan held a 2-0 lead over 
Johns Hopkins. 

But the shutout held for just 

30 more seconds, before Blue 
Jay attackman CeCe Finney 
gave her team its first goal of 
the game. One minute later, 
Finney scored again, and after 
that the Wolverines’ Potemkin 
lead collapsed into a 15-8 loss.

Three minutes after Finney’s 

second goal, midfielder Nicole 

DeMase gave Johns Hopkins 
(1-3, 9-4) the lead for good. The 
Blue Jays flew away with the rest 
of the half, as they scored five 
more goals — eight unanswered 
in total — to 
take an 8-2 lead 
with 10 minutes 
remaining 
in 

the period.

Following 

Johns Hopkins’ 
eighth 
goal, 

Michigan 
coach Jennifer 
Ulehla 
decided to pull 
sophomore 
starting goalie 
Mira 
Shane 

in 
favor 
of 

redshirt freshman Alli Kothari.

Kothari 
proved 
valuable 

for the remainder of the first 
period, saving two shots and 
allowing no goals. Her saves 
started 
to 
build 
up 
some 

momentum for the Wolverines, 
and with just 23 seconds 

remaining 
in 
the 
period, 

freshman midfielder Chandler 
Kirby scored the team’s first 
goal in over 27 minutes – a 
much needed boost going into 

the locker room.

Just 
38 

seconds 
into 

the second half, 
Coughlan found 
the back of the 
net for the second 
time. A mere 13 
seconds 
after 

that, 
freshman 

midfielder Molly 
Garrett put the 
ball past Blue Jay 
goalie 
Caroline 

Federico, 
and 

suddenly 
the 

Wolverines found new life.

Johns Hopkins expanded the 

lead back to four just before the 
28-minute mark — capping off 
a barrage of three goals in two 
minutes to begin the period — 
and that difference held steady 
for eight more minutes.

The Michigan resurgence 

was still not over, though, as 
freshman attacker Lilly Grass 
and redshirt junior attacker 
Bianca Brueckner both found 
the back of the net to narrow 
the 
Wolverines’ 
deficit 
to 

just two – the team’s smallest 
margin since the 20:13 mark of 
the first period.

But 
the 
resurgence 

disappeared as quickly as the 
mirage it appeared to be. The 
Blue Jays outscored Michigan 
6-1 in the closing half of the 
second period to secure a 15-8 
lead and win their first Big Ten 
game of the season.

For 
the 
Wolverines, 
the 

loss marks the third straight 
in as many Big Ten matches 
since they won their opening 
conference game against Ohio 
State. 
Michigan 
will 
have 

two more chances to earn 
wins against Big Ten teams at 
home and improve its standing 
before the Big Ten Tournament 
in College Park.

But the 

resurgence 
disappeared 
as quickly as 
the mirage it 

appeared to be.

“There were a couple of 

opportunities that we had 
that maybe we missed,” 
Rennard said. “But I think 
we did a really good job 
on offense, defense and 
pitching to settle things 
down.”

Despite the loss, the 

bullpen proved to be a 
bright spot. In six and 
two-thirds 
innings 
of 

relief, the bullpen allowed 
only one run and struck 
out 
seven. 
Rennard 

highlighted the bullpen’s 
strong 
effort, 
coming 

in for Hendrickson and 
allowing only one run in 
3.2 innings.

“(My mindset) was just 

to throw up zeroes, and 
keep the team in it by 
doing the best job I could 
and swing the momentum 
back 
in 
our 
favor,” 

Rennard said.

In 
order 
to 
ensure 

that Sunday’s game is an 
anomaly, Michigan must 
be ready to play from the 
start.

“We all (need to) lock 

it in from pitch one,” 
Rennard 
said. 
“You’re 

supposed 
to 
be, 
and 

sometimes 
it 
doesn’t 

happen. So from pitch one 
having that mentality of 
being aggressive and not 
feel out the first inning.”

During the second game, Falk 

blasted a three-run bomb, seizing 
the lead that Ohio State previously 
held. Blanco was a presence at the 
plate as well, adding four RBI in the 
game, including a three-run double 
that cushioned Michigan’s victory 
in the sixth inning.

Sophomore second baseman 

Faith Canfield posted a career-high 
four hits in the second game, going 
7-for-10 on the day.

Canfield’s elite performance in 

the doubleheader is consistent with 
her recent achievement at the plate. 
She now bats .373 on the season 
— the third-best average for the 
Wolverines.

“I’ve just kind of been getting 

comfortable,” Canfield said. “And I 
just go up (to the plate) to attack, see 
ball hit ball, just keeping it simple.”

Betsa had yet another impressive 

showing as well, fanning 21 
Buckeyes over 10 total innings 
pitched on the day. The ace tossed 
a complete-game win in the first 
slate and relieved Blanco for the last 
three innings of the second. She was 
untouchable in relief, allowing zero 
hits and collecting nine strikeouts.

Moving forward, Michigan is 

looking to have a lot more days like 
Saturday.

“My goal is for us to just keep 

getting better,” Hutchins said. 
“We’ve gotten a lot better in the 
last month and two months, but 
I thought we took a step back 
(Sunday). We can’t ever think that 
were done getting better.”

Hudson leads the way in VIPER competition

Entering the 2017-18 season, 

replacing Jabrill Peppers is the 
undisputed top priority for the 
Michigan football team.

The 
redshirt 
sophomore 

took ‘making an impact all 
over the field’ to a whole new 
level last year, spending time at 
linebacker, safety, nickelback, 
running back, slot receiver and 
wildcat quarterback. Peppers 
more than lived up to the hype 
he brought with him to Ann 
Arbor as the No. 2 player in the 
2014 recruiting class, and the 
accolades poured in.

He earned Big Ten Defensive 

Player of the Year, Linebacker of 
the Year and Return Specialist 
of the Year honors — and 
that’s just on the conference 
level. Peppers, a Unanimous 
First Team All-American, also 
received 
the 
Paul 
Hornung 

Award for his trademark quality 
of versatility in his final season 
as a Wolverine.

But 
Peppers’ 
main 
role 

was the VIPER — a hybrid 
linebacker/safety in Michigan 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 

Brown’s system.

The Wolverines caught a 

glimpse of life without Peppers 
in their 33-32 Orange Bowl loss 
to Florida State. That game 
pushed the question of who 
would replace him at the VIPER 
next season to the forefront.

Halfway through spring ball, 

the spot is still up for grabs, 
but sophomore defensive back 
Khaleke Hudson looks likely to 
be Michigan’s answer.

“It means a lot that Coach 

Brown trusts me enough to be 
the VIPER,” Hudson said. “... 
Everyone’s been working hard, 
but it just means a lot to be there. 
I feel that it’s a good fit for me, to 
be able to play in the box (and) 
play outside.

“It’s a position where you 

could be all over the field, you 
could be at safety, you could 
be at linebacker, you could be 
in the slot, so you have a lot of 

responsibilities.”

Hudson 
and 
fellow 

sophomore defensive back Josh 
Metellus have been taking reps 
at both VIPER and safety so far 
this spring, but Hudson seems 
to have the upper hand over 
his classmate. Despite minimal 
playing time on defense last 
year, Hudson did see action 
at 
safety 
in 
two 
games, 

contributing eight tackles and 
one pass breakup.

While 
splitting 
time 
at 

multiple positions could serve as 
a distraction for some, Hudson 
sees the experience as beneficial 
to his growth. As the VIPER, 
Hudson would have to balance 
pass defense and run stoppage, 
both of which require a different 
mindset and skillset.

“You see everything from a 

different perspective,” Hudson 
said. “You might see everything 
farther back (and) then you 
see it up close in the box. Just 

knowing what everyone else 
does makes your job even easier.

“One play, you could tackle 

someone who’s fast, the next 
you could tackle someone big 
and strong. You just have to be 
prepared for who your opponent 
is.”

Hudson made a name for 

himself on the special teams 
unit last season for his ability to 
see a play develop ahead of time. 
Blocking a punt against both 
Illinois and Indiana — putting 
him in a tie for the team lead — 
Hudson was named the special 
teams player of the game twice.

Guided by Michigan special 

teams coach Chris Partridge, 
who also heads the linebacker 
unit, Hudson carved out a 
role for himself on kickoffs, 
punt 
returns 
and 
returns. 

Interestingly, 
Partridge 
was 

the head coach at Paramus 
Catholic High School in New 
Jersey where he helped develop 

Peppers into the special teams 
threat that he is. 

“He coaches it well. He gets 

us prepared for each team,” 
Hudson said. “… I just worked 
hard, and good things happen 
when you work hard.”

With that strong work ethic 

on display in spring ball as 
well, Hudson has distinguished 
himself from the competition 
at VIPER. While the question 
of replacing Peppers will likely 
persist well into the fall, Hudson 
has begun to give the Wolverines 
an answer.

And with his new role starting 

to take shape, Hudson has begun 
to hear a different question.

“Everyone’s asking me about, 

‘How does it feel replacing 
Jabrill?’ ” Hudson said. “But I 
just take it as, ‘I’m gonna play 
the best I play and be the best 
Khaleke,’ and just work hard 
and do everything top notch and 
work 100 percent every day.”

MEN’S GYMNASTICS
‘M’ struggles at Big 
Ten championships

At 
the 
Big 
Ten 

championships in Champaign 
this 
weekend, 
the 
No. 
9 

Michigan men’s gymnastics 
team competed with hopes 
of staying competitive in the 
stacked conference.

But out of the seven schools 

competing, 
the 
Wolverines 

finished in dead last, with No. 
3 Ohio State taking home the 
win followed closely by No. 4 
Illinois.

Michigan 
(3-5 
Big 
Ten, 

7-13 overall) was led in the 
all around competition by its 
top 
gymnast, 

sophomore 
Emyre 
Cole, 

who 
finished 

in sixth place 
with a score of 
80.650. 
Cole 

also 
offered 

an 
impressive 

performance in 
the floor event, 
taking 
third 

place 
with 
a 

score of 14.700.

The 

Wolverines 
had 
previously 

been in good form, winning 
two 
of 
their 
last 
three 

individual meets — a 409.200-
405.300 
loss 
against 
No. 

7 
Penn 
State 
sandwiched 

between a 402.10-386.80 win 
over No. 8 California and a 
414.950-368.600 victory over 
No. 17 UIC — coming into this 
weekend’s championships.

Michigan 
also 
received 

impressive performances on 
the vault, courtesy of Cole as 
well as sophomore Anthony 
McCallum. 
McCallum 

placed 
second 
overall 
for 

the 
second 
straight 
year 

with a score of 14.800, just 
behind Minnesota’s Yaroslav 
Pochinka, 
who 
scored 
a 

14.900. Cole tied for third 
with Minnesota’s Zach Liebler 
and Vitali Kan with a score of 
14.700.

The Wolverines didn’t score 

as well in the pommel horse 
as their top scorer, freshman 
Mack Lasker, finished in ninth 
place with a score of 14.000 — a 
far cry from the winner of the 
event, Illinois’s Brandon Ngai, 
who paced the competition 
with his score of 14.550.

Despite the tough finish in 

the pommel horse, Michigan 
bounced back in the high 
bar. Sophomore Adam Dean 
finished tied for second with 
Minnesota’s Jalon Stephens 

with a score of 
14.500. 
Dean 

tied, and was 
close 
behind 

Illinois’s Tyson 
Bull, who won 
the event with a 
score of 14.550.

The 

Wolverines 
also failed to 
impress on the 
rings. 
Their 

best finisher in 
the event was 

sophomore 
Ryan 
Dunning, 

who was 13th with a score of 
13.700.

The 
final 
event 
of 
the 

weekend was the parallel bar, 
where the Wolverines were 
once again carried by Cole. 
Cole finished tied for seventh 
with 
Nebraska’s 
Anton 

Stephenson and Ohio State’s 
Jake Dastrup with a score of 
14.200.

Michigan has to bounce 

back 
quickly 
after 
its 

disappointing 
last-place 

finish, as the Wolverines will 
compete next weekend at the 
NCAA Championships next 
weekend, hoping to improve 
upon their ninth-place finish 
from last year.

Michigan claims weekend sweep

Confidence 
seemed 
to 
be 

radiating from the Michigan 
men’s tennis team on Sunday 
as it defended its home court to 
continue climbing up the Big Ten 
leaderboard.

The energetic Wolverines (6-1 

Big Ten, 16-4 overall) surged into 
sole possession of second place in 
conference standings after two 
home wins against Minnesota 
(4-3, 15-6) on Friday, 5-2, and 
Wisconsin (4-2, 14-4) on Sunday, 
4-0. 

Strong doubles play was crucial 

for the Wolverines to find success 
against the Badgers. On the No. 1 
doubles line, senior Jathan Malik 
was paired with freshman Connor 
Johnston — a potentially daunting 
place for such a young player.

But not for Johnston.
After being up 5-2 and having 

the opportunity to seize the 
match, 
Johnston 
and 
Malik 

squandered the game, giving 
Wisconsin hope. But that didn’t 
faze Johnston, as he and Malik 
took the next game and the 
match, 6-3, to secure the doubles 
point for Michigan.

“I definitely use energy to my 

advantage,” Johnston said. “I try 
to win points and just go as crazy 
as I can and I feed off of that. The 
crazier I go, the better I play.”

Johnston’s role is strictly in 

doubles play for now, but the 
energy he creates clearly benefits 
his team.

The Wolverines are 15-0 on the 

season when securing the doubles 

point, and senior Kevin Wong 
stepped up to make sure they 
wouldn’t suffer their first blemish 
Sunday.

Capitalizing 
on 
an 
early 

opportunity, 
Wong 
found 
his 

groove to break his opponent 
and take a 4-1 lead in the first 
set. Although things seemed to 
be smooth for Wong, Wisconsin 

freshman Chase Colton fought 
back to win three straight games 
and lock up the first set at four 
all. However, Wong’s experience 
proved to be too much for Colton, 
as he surged to a 6-4, 6-4 win to 
give the Wolverines one of three 
singles wins to take the match, 4-0.

“I was proud of him today,” said 

Michigan coach Adam Steinberg. 
“He’s had an injury and the last 
few weeks he hasn’t really played 
much singles, and to come out 
in these conditions with a win 
against a really good player from 
Wisconsin, that was a big lift for 
us. I thought if we gave out an 
MVP for today, it’d be him.”

Michigan has been dominant 

in Big Ten play, but it doesn’t want 
the train to stop chugging.

“Obviously it’s not our goal,” 

Steinberg said. “Our goal is to be 
number one, so that’s what we are 
trying to do and what we are really 
focusing on.”

With just four matches left 

before the Big Ten Tournament, 
Michigan’s play has been stellar 
enough to potentially take the 
top spot, but the Wolverines must 
continue to bring a high level of 
energy if they want their goals to 
become results.

‘M’ remains unbeaten in Big Ten

The No. 8 Michigan women’s 

tennis team rebounded from 
a tough match against North 
Carolina on Thursday to notch 
two conference road wins this 
weekend against Rutgers and 
Maryland.

The Wolverines (8-0 Big Ten, 

16-4 overall) — who had their 
six-match win streak snapped by 
the Tar Heels in Chapel Hill — 
came away with two convincing 
victories this weekend, taking 
down the Scarlet Knights (1-8, 
6-12) 6-1, and the Terrapins (3-4, 
12-5) 4-1.

“Maryland was really tough,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 

Bernstein. “We got off to a slow 
start in doubles, and we had 
to rely on the singles to come 
through. I’m proud of our playing. 
We had our backs against the wall 
today.”

Sophomores Kate Fahey and 

Brienne Minor — the No. 1 and 
No. 2 singles players — led the 
Wolverines. Fahey won her match 
handily, emerging with a 6-3, 
6-0 victory over the Terrapins’ 
Alexandra Stanova. Minor had 

a much tougher match, battling 
back after losing the first set to 
win 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 over Ekaterina 
Tour.

Fahey and Minor also won 

their singles matches Friday 
against Rutgers, proving that the 
two continue to be the driving 
force behind Michigan’s success 
this season.

“Those two, being sophomores, 

playing up high like that, it gives 
everyone else confidence all the 
way down the lineup,” Bernstein 
said. “We need to put six people 
out there that are fighting and 
competing for the win.”

The Wolverines also received 

support from the other singles 
lines 
Sunday, 
as 
freshman 

Chiara Lommer brought home 
a victory at No. 4 singles against 
Kate Yemelyanenko, 6-1, 6-2. 
Freshman Valeria Patiuk also 
produced a strong effort, winning 
her match at No. 6 singles, 6-3, 
6-0 over Caroline Williams. The 
other two singles matches were 
abandoned before they were 
completed once Michigan had 
clinched the match overall.

Maryland did have success 

against Michigan in the doubles, 
as they took two out of the three 

matches. Fahey and junior Alex 
Najarian took the No. 1 doubles 
match, 6-2, over Stanova and 
Kristina Hovsepyan. However, 
the Terrapins captured a victory 
in the No. 2 doubles match, 
where Tour and Williams took 
down Minor and junior Mira 
Ruder-Hook, 6-2. Maryland also 
took the deciding No. 3 doubles 
match, with Cassandre Thebault 
and Arnelle Sullivan defeating 
Lommer 
and 
senior 
Annie 

Wierda, 6-1, to win the doubles 
point. 

“I think the biggest takeaway 

is that we need to figure out our 
doubles and get to where we 
need to be in May over the next 
couple of weeks,” Bernstein said. 
“We’re not even giving ourselves 
a chance. We need to change it up 
a little bit, maybe give people new 
looks in partners.”

The Wolverines will return 

home this weekend with matches 
against conference foes Iowa 
and Nebraska after the solid 
performances on the road.

“It was good, we had a tough 

weekend just being on the road,” 
said Bernstein. “I just think these 
tough matches are only gonna 
make us better moving forward.”

BASEBALL
Lugbauer’s grand slam
propels ‘M’ to victory

With one swing of the bat, 

junior 
third 
baseman 
Drew 

Lugbauer rejuvenated the No. 18 
Michigan 
baseball 
team 
and 
the 

depleted crowd at Ray Fisher 
stadium.

In the bottom of the fifth, 

with the bases loaded and the 
Wolverines down 8-3, Lugbauer 
sent the ball over the left-field 
wall for his second grand slam of 
the season.

“Once Drew (Lugbauer) got 

that big hit, even though we were 
down a run, I think the mindset 
of the guys was, ‘We know down 
a run is nothing,’ ” said Michigan 
Coach Erik Bakich. “The belief 
system was we’re going to find a 
way to tie it up and find a way on 
top.”

And three at-bats later, the 

team did just that, as redshirt 
sophomore 
left 
fielder 
Miles 

Lewis scored on a fielder’s choice, 
tying the game at eight apiece.

From there, Michigan (5-2 Big 

Ten, 24-6 overall) completed its 
seven-run comeback to notch a 9-8 
victory against Illinois (0-4 Big Ten, 
10-17 overall) on Friday, marking 
the Wolverines’ largest come-from-
behind effort of the season.

In first game of the weekend 

series, Michigan’s ace left-hander 
Oliver 
Jaskie 
simply 
wasn’t 

himself. The junior survived just 
three innings, surrendering seven 
runs (five earned) on five hits 
and three walks. It was Jaskie’s 
shortest outing of the season.

The Fighting Illini got to Jaskie 

right away, as leadoff batter Jack 
Yalowitz began the game with a 
home run. Illinois added another 
run on a passed ball by senior 
catcher Harrison Wenson.

After showing promise by 

retiring the side in order in the 
second inning, the Fighting Illini 
again overwhelmed Jaskie in the 
third, increasing their lead to 7-0. 
The inning was highlighted by a 

bloop single by designated hitter 
Casey Dodge that scored two 
runs.

Despite the large deficit, the 

Wolverine players never thought 
they were out of it.

“We kind of just felt like we 

knew we were going to come 
back,” Lugbauer said. “We believe 
in each other and just play our 
game.”

Bakich wasn’t as optimistic, 

noting he was “very concerned” 
with his team down seven runs.

However, 
in 
the 
fourth, 

Michigan began to mount its 
comeback, putting up three runs.

The rally started with a one-

out single by senior centerfielder 
Johnny Slater, who then stole 
second. In the next at-bat, senior 
shortstop Michael Brdar blasted 
a double to left-center, scoring 
Slater. Both Lewis and sophomore 
right fielder Jonathan Engelmann 
followed with a pair of singles, 
scoring two more runs.

In the seventh, two innings 

after the Wolverines tied the 
game, Michigan established its 
first lead. Lewis – who went 3-for-
3 on the day with two runs batted 
in and two runs scored – hit a 
double to the wall in left-center, 
scoring Lugbauer to make it 9-8.

In the top of the eighth, Illinois 

attempted a comeback of its own. 
But with runners on the corners 
and one out, senior right-hander 
Mac Lozer produced a strikeout 
and fly out to retire the side. 

“(The victory) was great, it 

sets the tone (for the rest of the 
series),” Lewis said. “It’s maybe a 
wake-up call to not come out so 
flat tomorrow.”

The comeback win displayed 

the fighters mentality that has 
been stressed to the team all 
season. Bakich and his players 
credit this to their extensive 
mental toughness training in the 
offseason.

“I think the belief system is 

there that we can comeback,” 
Bakich said. “But it’s one thing to 
think you can do it and it’s another 
thing to actually do it.”

Wolverines notch one-hitter against Illinois

If the No. 18 Michigan 

baseball team learned anything 
from Friday’s comeback win 
over Illinois, it was to come out 
strong from the first pitch.

The Wolverines put that 

lesson into practice in the 
second 
game 
of 

their series 
against the 
Fighting Illini (0-5 Big Ten, 
10-18 overall), as Michigan 
sent seven Wolverines up to bat 
and scored three runs in the 
first inning alone en route to a 
7-0 victory.

Sophomore second baseman 

Ako 
Thomas 
reached 
base 

first from the leadoff spot, 
hitting a slow rolling ball to 
the shortstop and beating the 
throw to first. Though he was 
later thrown out at the plate, 
his hit started the ball rolling 
for the rest of the lineup. 
Redshirt 
sophomore 
left 

fielder Miles Lewis smacked 
a double to the corner of left 
field, scoring senior shortstop 
Michael 
Brdar 
and 
senior 

centerfielder Johnny Slater.

The Wolverines (6-2, 25-6) 

are 
currently 
12-0 
when 

leading after the first inning, a 
big incentive to 
strike early.

“We 
talked 

about the last 
two 
games 

and 
playing 

from a deficit 
and 
digging 

ourselves 
a 

hole,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 
Erik 

Bakich. 
“If 

that’s the case, that’s the case, 
we’ll do it if we need to, but it’s 
not exactly how you want to 
draw it up.

“We wanted to get a good 

lead and establish a lead and 
try to extend it.”

Michigan kept up its scoring 

in the next inning, when junior 

third baseman Drew Lugbauer 
singled 
to 
centerfield 
and 

picked up two runs batted-in 
to give him 41 on the season — 
increasing his lead atop the Big 
Ten.

On 
the 
mound 
for 
the 

Wolverines was junior right-

hander 
Ryan 

Nutof, 
who 

had one of his 
best outings of 
the season. He 
allowed 
only 

one hit through 
six 
scoreless 

innings. 
Nutof 

had 
been 

struggling 
the 

most out of the 
weekend starters 

— posting a 5.84 earned-run 
average — but he was sharp on 
the bump against Illinois.

“We walked a few early, had 

to pitch out of some pressure 
situations early,” Bakich said. 
“But as the game progressed, 
Ryan Nutof in the fourth, fifth 
and sixth was better than he 

was in the first, second and 
third.

“And then (junior right-

hander) 
Jayce 
Vancena 

followed his lead and so did 
(sophomore right-hander) Jack 
Bredeson of just attacking the 
strike zone and letting the 
defense work behind them.”

Vancena 
and 
Bredeson 

rounded out the pitching effort 
for 
Michigan 
on 
Saturday, 

contributing to the one-hitter 
— a feat the Wolverines hadn’t 
accomplished since 2012.

The Fighting Illini posed 

the biggest threat to Michigan 
in the third inning. Third 
baseman Trent Hammond got 
the team’s first — and only — 
hit of the day with a double 
to left field. With a runner 
in scoring position, Thomas 
denied Illinois’ Jack Yalowitz 
with a diving stop. When 
Nutof later walked a Fighting 
Illini batter to load the bases, 
Thomas came up clutch once 
again with an easy putout to 
first to end the inning.

After putting up five runs 

through the first two innings, 
the Wolverines cooled down 
for the rest of the game. 
Michigan tacked on two more 
runs in the sixth and eighth 
innings to extend its lead, and 
Illinois couldn’t come up with 
a response.

All but two of the Wolverine 

batters managed a hit, with 
Thomas and Slater leading 
the team with four and three, 
respectively. 
Both 
singled 

each time from the one and 
two slots, respectively, in the 
batting order. Their ability 
to reach base is crucial for 
Michigan.

“Anytime you can get the 

top of your order on base, 
those guys are table setters, 
they’re catalysts,” Bakich said. 
“Especially those two because 
they can get in motion and 
advance into scoring position, so 
anytime we get them on base we 
create scoring opportunities.”

The Wolverines have now 

won nine straight games and 
will look to continue their 
streak in the series finale 
Sunday afternoon.

Michigan can’t claim second comeback win

On 
Sunday, 
the 
Michigan 

baseball 
team 
learned 
the 

difference a day can make. After 
taking their first two games in 
the series against Illinois, the 
Wolverines fell to the Fighting 
Illini in the third game of the 
series, 7-5.

Sunday’s 
game 
closely 

mirrored Friday’s. In both games, 
Michigan fell into a hole early, 
surrendering six and seven runs, 
respectively, through the first 
three innings. The only difference 
was the Wolverines’ ability to 
forge a rally.

While they made an impressive 

comeback in Friday’s outing to 
steal the game, 9-8, the resurgence 
wasn’t in the cards Sunday. 

In the bottom of the ninth 

inning with one out, sophomore 
second baseman Ako Thomas 
started off the effort by taking 
base after being hit by a pitch. 
With the tying run at the plate, 

senior centerfielder Johnny Slater 
hit a single to left field to put two 
men on base.

In a situation like that, senior 

shortstop Michael Brdar is the 
one player the Wolverines would 
want at the plate. Coming into 
Sunday’s game, he carried a 
17-game hitting streak and had 
his chance to extend it in the 
ninth frame. Unfortunately for 
Michigan, that streak came to an 
end. Brdar popped a ball up to left 
field for the second out.

With one more out to work 

with, junior third baseman Drew 
Lugbauer stepped to the plate. He 
has come to be known as the player 
who can provide for Michigan 
in big moments. Lugbauer is no 
stranger to walk-off home runs, 
as he hit a three-run home run 
against 
Northern 
Illinois 
on 

March 19. He currently has nine 
home runs on the season, with the 
most recent being a grand slam in 
Friday’s game against Illinois to 
help the Wolverines overcome 
their deficit.

The two-ball, two-strike, two-

out pitch was perfect. Lugbauer 
crushed it towards the left-field 
wall. But the high winds forced 
the ball foul — robbing him of 
the walk-off home run — and he 
struck out swinging on the next 
pitch to end the game.

“I don’t want to say there 

is 
(complacency), 
but 
that’s 

obviously a slight part of it,” said 
junior right-hander Alec Rennard. 
“I think that is one factor, you 
don’t want to get complacent, you 
want to stay hungry. No matter 
how much you win by, you always 
want to focus on how much you 
didn’t do right.”

The loss ended a nine-game 

winning streak for the Wolverines, 
who have been prone to pull out 
comeback wins as of late. Michigan 
came back from a three-run deficit 
Tuesday against Notre Dame and 
a seven-run deficit Friday against 
the Fighting Illini.

“We kind of just felt like we 

knew we were going to comeback 
the whole time,” Lugbauer said 

Friday. “Even when we were 
down seven, we were like ‘Alright, 
whatever.’ … We were smiling and 
laughing, no worries, that’s just 
kind of the team we have this 
year.”

While this mindset worked 

Friday, it may have hurt Michigan 
on Sunday.

The Wolverines weren’t able 

to connect their hits like they had 
earlier in the series. Friday and 
Saturday’s game saw a lot of action 
from Michigan, as they totaled 25 
hits through two days. On Sunday, 
though, just five players combined 
nine team hits. 

“It’s just that early deficit 

where we’ve been fortunate to 
be able to comeback and come 
out on top,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “It didn’t end up that 
way today. That’s what happens 
when you play with fire that many 
times, eventually you get burned.

“It’s too bad we had to learn 

this lesson this way. But if I know 
this group at all, which I do, 
they’ll bounce right back.”
