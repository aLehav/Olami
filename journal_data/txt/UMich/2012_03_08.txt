STUDENT GOVERNMENT
* Three more
seek CSG
presidency

New Students for
Puppies party
launched
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
As the Central Student Gov-
ernment presidential election
ears, it now appears that six
candidates will vie for the execu-
tive position as several students
announced candidacies yester-
day.
Business School junior Man-
ish Parikh publicly announced
his candidacy for president
yesterday alongside running
mate Omar Hashwi, an LSA
sophomore. Additionally, the
Defend Affirmative Action Party
announced they will soon be
choosing a candidate for presi-
dent, and Dentistry student
Andrew Horne shared plans to
run as part of the newly formed
Students for Puppies party with
running mate Daniel Ruff, a fel-
low Dentistry student.
Parikh and Hashwi made
the announcement at a CSG
candidates meeting last night
in advance of the upcoming
election, and said they will be
running as independents unaf-
* filiated with any party.
Now with Hashwi's candidacy
for vice president, four of the
five students who vied for MFor-

ward's nomination in January
are now running for either CSG
president or vice president. LSA
junior Aditya Sathi won MFor-
ward's nomination at the party's
convention, but since then Busi-
ness School junior Shreya Singh
and Public Policy junior Kevin
Mersol-Barg each formed a new
party and announced their can-
didacies for president.
Aside from only attending a
handful of CSG assembly meet-
ings, Parikh has no ties to stu-
dent government as he embarks
on his candidacy for president.
However, Hashwi was the lead
vote recipient in the LSA assem-
bly representative elections last
March, and has worked on proj-
ects in CSG such as implement-
ing Saturday night dining in the
residence halls and increasing
wireless Internet speeds on cam-
pus.
Parikh said his position as an
outsider makes him uniquely
qualified for office.
"I feel strongly that a lot of
people who pursue student gov-
ernment are resume builders,"
Parikh said. "I'm not saying
(that's what) past leaders in spe-
cific have done, but that's kind of
the culture."
Parikh added that CSG has
also lost its importance and
direction on campus.
"There has been serious apa-
thy that the students at large

Federal appeals court,
hears Proposal 2 case

Judges to decide
fate of state's
affirmative action
ban
By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
Parties advocating for and
against the state's ban on affir-
mative action were back in court
yesterday as a federal appeals
court heard arguments pertain-

ing to the policy's constitutional-
ity.
Proposal 2, a ballot proposal
passed in 2006, eliminated the
ability to consider race in the
admissions process at public
universities in Michigan. Yes-
terday's appeal, the latest step in
a years-long legal process, was
heard before a 15-judge panel at
the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals
in Cincinnati, which hears fed-
eral appeals in cases originating
from Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky
and Tennessee.
Last July a three-judge panel

ruled in favor of striking down
the ban. The court later decided
to reexamine the case before a
larger panel.
Groups initiating the appeal
included the American Civil Lib-
erties UnionBy Any MeansNec-
essary - an organization that
support affirmative action initia-
tives - and the National Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of
Colored People.
ACLU attorney Mark Rosen-
baum, one of the attorneys who
argued the case, said the repeal
of Proposal 2 would allow for

race to be debated in admissions
processes in the state of Michi-
gan.
"(Under Proposal 2), if you
want to argue that your racial
identity should also be consid-
ered as part of the mosaic of a
diverse student body, you are
forbidden from raising that sub-
ject," Rosenbaum said.
The case did not deal with
the constitutionality of affir-
mative action policies, as in
the Grutter v. Bollinger case in
2003, in which the United States

UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION
Task force to examine
child misconduct at 'U'

Group proposed by
President Coleman
aims to protect
minors on campus
By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
In the wake of the recent
incident involving alleged child
pornography at the University
of Michigan Health System and
the widely publicized incidents

at Penn State University, the
University is in the planning
phases of assembling a task
force to prevent inappropriate
conduct with children at the
University in the future.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman first announced
her intention to implement the
task force, which will investi-
gate all University programs
involving children, at the Sen-
ate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs meeting on
Dec. 5. According to University
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald, the

task force is currently in the
information-gathering stage,
and will be comprised of Kelly
Cunningham, the University's
director of public affairs, and
Donica Varner, associate gen-
eral counsel.
Cunningham and Varner will
research the structure of Uni-
.vegityprograns, such as, day-
cares and summer camps, and
the details of their policies on
criminal activities before exam-
ining methods of improvement

Police stress need for caution

Candidates to
be chosen at
convention on Sat.
By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
While Law Prof. Bridget
McCormack has long challenged
her students to practice law ethi-
cally and with integrity, she may
soon have the chance to apply

those same values in the Michi-
gan Supreme Court.
McCormack - who has been
teaching at the University Law
School since 1998 and is current-
ly the associate dean for clini-
cal affairs - is running for the
Democratic nomination for the
state Supreme Court. The state
party will choose its nominee at
its endorsement convention Sat-
urday in Detroit. If nominated,
McCormack will continue on
to a nonpartisan election that

begins with a primary election
in August and a general election
on Nov. 6. This year, there are
three seats up for election in the
seven-seat court.
McCormack said she hopes to
receive the nomination this Sat-
urday because she believes her
personal ethics and experience
would be a valuable addition to
the state Supreme Court.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Bing: Emergency
manager won't fix
Detroit's finances
The future of cash-starved
Detroit still could end up in the
state's hands, but it may not be
through a financial overseer
appointed by the governor.
In his third State of the City
speech since being elected
mayor, Dave Bing told residents
that he and Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder have similar opinions on
Detroit going into state receiver-
ship.
"Gov. Snyder and I both agree
that an emergency manager is
not the best approach," Bing said
Wednesday in the nearly 30-min-
ute address. "We're working
hard toward a solution to resolve
our city's financial challenges."
A preliminary review shows
Detroit has a budget deficit of
about $200 million. A 10-person
review team currently is poring
over the city's books and opera-
tions. They are expected within
weeks to report their findings to
Snyder as to whether a financial
emergency exists in Detroit.
TUPELO, Miss.
Santorum says a
win in Mississippi
will redefine race
Urging conservatives not to
yield, Republican Rick Santorum
told supporters yesterday that
they could make the GOP presi-
dential contest a two-man race
if they deliver him a victory next
week and offer an embarrassing
loss to rival Newt Gingrich in the
South.
Santorum and Gingrich have
been competing to emerge as
front-runner Mitt Romney's
chief rival, yet they continue to
split the party's right-leaning
bloc. The division has allowed
Romney to shore up delegates
and momentum, including six of
the 10 states that weighed in on
Super Tuesday. Santorum won
three yet remained far behind
Romney.
SAN DIEGO, Calif.
Activists launch
viral video on
African atrocities
American filmmakers who
reported on wartime atroci-
ties in Africa for a 50-minute
work called "Invisible Children"
drew more attention than they
imagined when their project
was released in 2005. They soon
founded a nonprofit organization
to campaign against the brutal-
ity.
The group's new 29-minute
video is gaining even more atten-
tion, thanks to social media. The
work released Monday is part of
an effort called KONY 2012 that
targets the Lord's Resistance
Army and its leader, Joseph

Kony, a bush fighter wanted
by the International Criminal
Court for crimes against human-
ity.
VIENNA
Iran may clean up
nuclear work
Satellite images of an Ira-
nian military facility appear to
show trucks and earth-moving
vehicles at the site, indicating an
attempted cleanup of radioactive
traces possibly left by tests of a
nuclear-weapon trigger, diplo-
mats told The Associated Press
on Wednesday.
The assertions from the diplo-
mats, all nuclear experts accred-
ited to the International Atomic
Energy Agency, could add to the
growing international pressure
on Iran over its nuclear pro-
gram, which Tehran insists is for
peaceful purposes.
While the U.S. and the EU
are backing a sanctions-heavy
approach, Israel has warned
that it may resort to a pre-emp-
tive strike against Iran's nucle-
ar facilities to prevent it from
obtaining atomic weapons.

CSG
From Page 1A
have developed towards the stu-
dent government," he said. "They
don't think the student govern-
ment is medium for affecting
change, they think that student
government is not a serious
institution, and they've failed to
capture the imagination of the
common student on campus."
Parikh identified two current
problems with CSG. The student
government makes unfulfilled
promises and fails to serve as a
direct representation of its con-
stituents, he said.
"(CSG says) that we think that
this will make campus a better
place. It may be a fantastic idea,
but that is not role of any govern-
ment," he said. "The role of gov-
ernment is to do what the people
who have elected you to office
want you to do."
Hashwisaidhe met Parikhlast
year at the library after Parikh
overheard him talking about
student government. Parikh said
he and Hashwi agreed to work
together in the future out of their
mutual interest to help students
while distancing themselves
from party politics.
"We do not intend to be politi-
cal people in our future," Hashwi
said "We want to help people; we
want to improve their lives. We
sincerely do."
Parikh said they had not final-
ized their candidacy plans until
Tuesday and have not released a
public platform yet.
While candidates may often
criticize their opponents' plat-
forms, Parikh lauded the ideas of
his opponents.
"We want to focus on the
strengths of our opponents,"
Parikh said. "All of (them) have
certain strengths. They do bring
positives to the table - their
leaders have done good things in
the past, and we feel that we will
recognize these strengths."
Before his decision to run for
office, Parikh said he belonged
to the University's Model United
Nations organization and found-
ed his own business, Sumo Deal,
a non-for-profit that offered dis-
counts at Ann Arbor businesses.
Parikh also stressed his casual
and open approach to governing
if elected.
"You're not going to see us in
suits and ties," Parikh said.
DEFEND AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION TO CHOOSE CAN-
DIDATE
Election director Peter

Borock, a law student, said the
Defend Affirmative Action Party
will also run a candidate for pres-
ident and vice president, though
they have yet to formally declare
their ticket.
ManymembersofDAAP could
not attend the meeting because
they were in Cincinnati yester-
dayto protestoutsidethe 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals as it re-
opened the case determining
whether the use of affirmative
action in college admissions at
public universities in Michigan is
legal. DAAP candidates and oth-
ers who missed yesterday's meet-
ing will be meeting with Borock
on Sunday.
When DAAP enters into the
race, the total number of CSG
presidential candidates will be
raised to six.
NEWLY-FORMED PARTY
ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR
CANDIDACY
In addition to Parikh's
announcement yesterday, Den-
tistry student Andrew Horne, a
representative of the CSG assem-
bly, also made his presidential
campaign public. He and running
mate Daniel Ruff, also a Dentistry
student, will be running as part of
the newly formed political party,
Students for Puppies.
Horne said he is still collabo-
rating with his campaign team to
form Students for Puppies' plat-
form.
"Our party is Students for
Puppies, and I don't know what
we stand for," Horne said. "We're
working on our position - we're
talking with our campaign man-
ager and getting things sorted
out."
He added: "(Puppies are) a
great animal. The University
right now uses them as therapy
dogs outside some exams. We
might go that route and cam-
paign for more puppies on cam-
pus, we might not. We're still
undecided.
Horne said he believes he
and Ruff will win the upcoming
election, emphasizing that his
campaign is not a joke.
"Absolutely, it's a serious cam-
paign," he said. "I would not be
running for president of CSG
if this was not a serious cam-
paign."
The decision to run was due
in part to his long tenure spent
in student government.
"It's a long time coming. I've
been in CSG for three years now,
and I've seen three different
presidents and vice presidents,"
Horne said. "I think it's time to
see some change."

pany does not install alarm sys-
tems in its properties.
During his address to resi-
dents, Jones suggested that
renters, who may not be allowed
to install wired alarm systems,
implement wireless alarm sys-
tems to secure their property.
Khan said an invasion has not
occurred at a CMB rental prop-
erty in several years. However,
she noted that she has observed
that the students' forgetfulness,
particularly in leaving doors
propped open, has led to inci-
dents at other rental properties.

of those recommendations, and
I'm pleased that we are going
to do that and we may get addi-

follow up on those too."
Coleman said the ulti-
mate goal of the program is to
ensure the safety of children
in all University programs and
investigate current policies on
reporting criminal activity.
"I want to know across the
University the way in which
underage children are interact-

to know what our policies are,

and what we need to be doing."

"We tried to be proactive and
send e-mails to our residents
to remind them to maintain a
high safety standard by locking
their doors and windows and
just being extra careful," Khan
said. "Since the assaults, the
residents are being more care-
ful and are not propping doors
open like they used to for their
friends."
AAPD detective Dave Mon-

gently with any information and
evidence they have received.
"If I were a resident, my pri-
mary concern would be that I
wouldn't want to have my home
broken into," Monroe said. "Sec-
ondly, I would want the attack-

In several incidents, burglars
have knocked on a resident's
door in order to see if a home is

roe said residents should make
their homes "look occupied,"

"We've certainly learned a lot

I'm very disappointed in what

Though the charges against

minor.
"Call us when you're con-

Dial back talk on Iran
GOP candidates shouldn't demand violence
Since President Barack Obama took office in 2009, there has
been a consistent trend of rhetorical extremism among politi-
cal candidates and policymakers ranging from unqualified
personal attacks to inappropriate statements on social issues that has
dominated our political discourse. Still, the recent barrage of rheto-
ric from the Republican presidential candidates promoting a military
attack on Iran, in violation of international law, as a legitimate option
for dealing with their nuclear prqgram is far more dangerous. The
current political climate surrounding an attack on Iran goes against
American intelligence and only quickens the path to violence.

f you are a driver or have a
friend who drives, you may have
noticed that rising gas prices
are draining peo-
ple's pockets. In
fact, driving and
fueling behaviors
have begun to
change as a result
of the 14.1-per-
cent year-to-date
increase in regu-
lar fuel costs. JASON
Analysts expect PANG JAO
gas to push to
$5 per gallon by
summertime when drivers ramp up
their gas expenditure. I will expand
on two causes that I consider most
culpable and explore U.S. political
and business options.
One of the most recognized causes
for the price hike is the Iranian dis-
pute. The nuclear program in Iran
has been widely criticized by both
the Obama and Bush administra-
tions for elevating geopolitical risks
in the Middle East. While countries
and international organizations have
condemned and even placed sanc-
tions against the oil-rich country,
Iran is not backing down. Claiming
its nuclear program is devoted to the
country's energy production, Iran
threatens to cut off its oil exports and
even seal off the Strait of Hormuz if it
were attacked by Israel or the United
States. The former threat was par-
tially carried out in February when
Iran stopped crude oil export to Brit-
ish and French firms in response to
the European Union's new sanctions,
while the latter still remains a grave
threat to the global economy.
The Strait of Hormuz is a strate-
gic waterway, and 20 percent of the
world's oil is transported through it.
Though the risk of Iran obstructing
the strait is small - as it would result
in Iran losing all of its oil revenue
- the potential downside to such
an action is significant and brought

the West Texas Intermediate Crude
Oil benchmark price up 7 percent
since the inception of the dispute in
December 2011. While the sealing of
the strait is highly improbable, evi-
dence suggests Iran may intend to
drive up the price of oil to boost the
Iranian economy, which is positively
correlated with the price of oil.
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, celebrated the revolts
in Tunisia, Egypt and Bahrain that
pushed the oil price above $110 per
barrel last spring, claiming that the
revolutions are in line with the Irani-
anspiritduringits 1979 revolution. In
reality, there have been more social
and political crackdowns and human
rights infringements in Egypt. Per-
haps Iranian officials wish to avoid
a civil war like those in the Middle
East and North Africa to preserve
their power. An Iranian-American
student at the University, who pre-
ferred to remain unnamed, called the
government "incredibly corrupt." As
long as the Iranian economy can keep
profiting off of the oil price, the gov-
ernment will take on any measure to
aid that cause.
A second contributor to high fuel
costs is the reduced supply of refined
petroleum. Since 2010, four east
coast refineries processing approxi-
mately 1 million barrels of oil daily
are expected to or have already
ceased operations. Analysts conclude
that thinning demand is cuttingmar-
gins below what some smaller refin-
eries can afford, driving them out of
businessbefore the real demand rises
for the spring and summer time. The
United States exported more refined
petroleum than it imported in 2011
for the first time since 1949 as a result
of a higher foreigngasoline price that
drove domestic fuel supply abroad.
With a smaller supply of gasoline and
a heavily inelastic demand for petro-
leum due to lack of economical sub-
stitutes such as natural gas vehicles,
hybrids, or electric vehicles, Ameri-

can drivers could face record-setting
gas price by this summer.
Strategically, the United States
should not wage a war against Iran as
it could lead to another global reces-
sion triggered by a 20-percent drop
in crude oil supply. Similarly, the
United States should monitor Israeli
responses to Iran's nuclear program,
as an Israeli attack on Iranian soil
may trigger retaliation by Iran.
Supply and
politics cause
high prices.
Domestically, the United States
has the option to establish energy
initiatives that would eventually
transition the country from an oil-
driven nation to a society predomi-
nantly fueled by natural gas, which
has been trading at a decade-low
price of $2.50 per million British
thermal units. This can be accom-
plished through tax breaks on
gas stations that provide liquefied
petroleum gas and reimbursement
to drivers that convert their vehi-
cles to use LPG, which costs about
$3,000 per conversion.
If you are an investor in the stock
market, I would not leave the trad-
ing day short on oil, gasoline or any
healthy energy stocks that have
wide distribution channels in the
United States. You should be espe-
cially cautious when holding secu-
rities that are highly sensitive to oil
price, such as airline and industrial
companies. Be sure to consult with
your financial adviser and hedge
your own exposure to the energy
market.

It isn't breaking news that all of the Repub-
lican candidates - aside from Ron Paul -
have all at one point or another advocated
something similar to Rick Santorum's threat
last month to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities
if they weren't dismantled during his presi-
dency. Last week, Obama spoke at the annual
American Israeli Public Affairs Committee
convention, a 'pro-Israel lobbyist gathering,
where he committed the United States to
using military force against Iran to prevent
it from acquiring a nuclear weapon, if sanc-
tions were unable to stop them. The debate
on this issue within the political mainstream
has narrowed to a point where any option
that doesn't include a preventative war with
Iran is simply not taken seriously.
While the Iranian nuclear program's
"threat" to Israel and the United States is
constantly regurgitated in nearly every major
mediaoutlet, U.S. intelligence disagrees with
this claim. The most recent National Intel-
ligence Estimate a collective report from
all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies - states that
there is no evidence that Iran is attempt-
ing to build a nuclear weapon. The fact that
under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
Iran has the right to pursue nuclear devel-
opment for a civilian purpose also seems to

have been forgotten.
The number of people who now view Iran
as a threat is nearly equivalent to the num-
ber of people who viewed Iraq as a threat in
2003. This goes to show how much political
rhetoric can influence the general popula-
tion. The fact that Americans want to go to
war does not make ita worthy cause.
There are also economic factors to con-
sider. The Republican candidates all stress
cost-cutting measures to reduce the deficit,
but a war would only increase the budget
gap. Wars are extremely costly, and would
put the nation into further debt. The Repub-
licans' stance on going to war with Iran does
not line up with their aim to slash the budget.
The threats against Iran have gotten out
of control. These claims go directly against
U.S. intelligence. The Republicans' push for
an attack also goes against their platform to
reduce the national deficit. Without concrete
evidence that Iran is makinga nuclear weap-
on outside of the Non-Proliferation Treaty,
the threat of a war should be put to rest. It
is time for our political leadership to move
away from counterproductive threats of vio-
lence and toward real diplomatic solutions
that express true concern for the security of
all parties involved.

Take back the tap

The debate over bottled water has been
going on for a long time. While everyone has
their own opinions on it, we should ultimate-
ly have options. These options are the reason
why, regardless of your beliefs about the bot-
tled water debate, we should allow empty reus-
able bottles into Michigan Stadium.
From the tailgates, cheering, standing and
hot weather (at least at the beginning of the
season), everyone needs water at the games.
But the only option we currently have is to pay
the ridiculous price of $4 per bottle or drink out
of one of the 28 water fountains in the stadium.
With more than 100,000 fans in attendance at
each game, that amounts to about 3,570 peo-
ple per one water fountain. The stadium also
provides little cups with a minimal amount of
water in them. However, you need a lot of these
cups to really quench your thirst - the obvious
issue of waste will be discussed later.
While most people buy bottled water out
of convenience or because they have no other
choice, some people still believe bottled water
is healthier than tap water. Contrary to popular
belief, bottled water is not safer than tap water.
There are more stringent standards and more
safety tests for tap water than bottled water.
The chemicals from the plastic bottle can also
leach into your water.
The manufacturing of bottled water uses
more water and energy than the amount of
water that actually goes into the bottle. The
Pacific Institute estimates that for every liter of
water in a plastic bottle, two liters of water are
used to make the plastic and bottle the water.

The manufacturing of polyethylene tere-
phthalate bottles, water extraction, bottling
and distribution amounts to up to 2,000 times
the energy cost of producing tap water.
A large problem with all the bottled water
in the stadium is the waste it produces. The
initiative to allow reusable water bottles into
the stadium can even help the Athletic Depart-
ment save money on waste pick-up by having
less waste produced from plastic water bottles.
Reasons mentioned for banning reusable
bottles were to avoid bringing alcohol into
the stadium and to expedite fans' admission
through the gate. Thankfully, there is an easy
solution to these problems: allow only empty
reusable bottles. This way, there is no way of
sneaking alcohol in the bottles and security
guards can easily and efficiently shake the bot-
tle to make sure it is empty - problem solved.
Some people are also worried about throwing
reusable bottles at other fans and onto the field,
but people can still buy a plastic bottle and
throw it, in addition to other items such as food
or clothing.
Our stadium is the Big House for a reason.
Let's use the power of all our fans to create a
more sustainable stadium. To sign the petition
to allow empty reusable water bottles in the Big
House, go to:

When I was seven, my par-
ents gave my younger
brother Tom and me a
cookie each. I
quickly devoured
mine, but Tom
was more inter-
ested in going
outside to play.
It was late, but I
promised Tom
that if he gave
me his cookie M
we could play. MATTHEW
He agreed, and ZABKA
while I ate his
cookie, Tom
asked my parents for permission to
go outside. They said no. My brother
- the tattle-tale - told my parents
what had happened, and I had to sit
in the corner for an hour.
Even though he was only five,
that day Tom learned even his older
brother could not control everything.
Today, tweets with the hashtag
"#250gas" suggest a similar les-
son has escaped in our 18-and-older
voting population: There are things
that even the president of the United
States cannot control.
As students filled up cars with
expensive gas to go wherever under-
graduates go for spring break, presi-
dential candidate Newt Gingrich
asserted that if he were president, gas
prices would plummet. "There is no
reason we can't get gasoline down to
$2 and $2.50 a gallon," Gingrich said
during a speech on Feb. 20 in Tulsa,
Arizona. His 2008 book is titled
"Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less: A
Handbook for Slashing Gas Prices
and Solving Our Energy Crisis."
Gingrich's argument for more
drilling appeals to the law of supply
and demand, which tells us that, all
else constant, if the supply of a com-
modity such as oil increases, its price
will fall. Increased drilling would
increase the supply of oil and thus
lower the price of gasoline.
His argument, however, ignores
the word "demand" in the law of
supply and demand, which also
tells us that, all else constant, if a
commodity's demand increases, its
price will increase. Since oil is sold
on the world market, "Drill Here,

Drill Now, Play Less" and #250gas
could only work if American oil
production increased enough to
counter increasing world demand.
The accompanying graph shows
U.S. oil production since 1940. Note
the decrease since the mid-1980s
that has resulted from drying wells
in Texas and the small increase
since 2008 as the result of new
technologies and drilling oppor-
tunities in places such as North
Dakota. Today, the United States
produces about 5.5 million barrels
of oil per day.
Let us assume that Gingrich were
elected in November and suppose
that in eight short years his policies
somehow caused the United States'
oil output to double, adding an addi-
tional 5.5 million barrels per day.
Would this be enough to counteract
rising world demand and lower our
gas prices to $2.50?
To answer this question we need
look at only one country. The U.S.
Energy Information Administra-
tion predicts China, which cur-
rently uses 9.1 million barrels per
day, will in 2020 use 12.7 million
barrels per day - an increase of 3.6
million barrels per day. So China
by itself could consume all of the

additional oil that we assumed the
United States would produce under
the Gingrich administration.
In addition, the assumption that
the United States could double oil
production in eight years is unrealis-
tic. The latest increase since 2009 in
U.S. oil production comes largely out
of North Dakota, and at its current
oil production level, doubling U.S.
production would require more than
twelve North Dakotas.
All of this suggests that while
increased drilling may reduce the
price Americans would otherwise
pay at the pump, demand outstrip-
ping supply will cause gas prices to
trend upward, regardless of a presi-
dent's oil policy.
Back in the 1980s, as I took my
brother's cookie, I knew I could
not possibly follow through on my
promise. ButI was seven, and I real-
ly wanted his cookie.
Today, a 68-year-old politician is
promising American voters $2.50
gas, something he knows he cannot
deliver.
Buthe really wants your votes.

PROPOSAL 2
From Page 1A
Supreme Court upheld the Univer-
sity's admissions policy that con-
sidered race in the holistic review
of an applicant. Rather, the case
examined whether an applicant's
presentation of his or her racial
background can be considered in
their application.
Rosenbaum said the execution
of Proposal2 in Michigan is a form
of inequity, and the case was mon-
umental as a civil rights hearing.
"In 2012, the way to discrimi-
nate is to take off the table racial
topics," Rosenbaum said. "It's to
say we cannot have advocacy -
pro or con - about racial topics."
BAMN national coordinator
Donna Stern said in a press release
yesterday that the consequences
of Proposal 2 are profound for
racial minorities in Michigan.
"Prop 2 has already sharply
reduced opportunities for tal-
ented young black, Latino and
Native-American students to
become doctors, lawyers, engi-
neers, professors and other lead-

ers," Stern said in the release. "It
is leading to a new form of Jim
Crow - separate and unequal -
in our nation."
African-American enrollment
at the University has decreased
by 15 percent from 2006 to 2010.
Enrollment in the University Law
School has declined by 28 percent,
according to the release.
Reverend Wendell Anthony,
president of the NAACP's Detroit
branch, said, in the BAMN press
release that the current stance on
race in the admissions process is
detrimental to the state's higher
education system.
"Proposal 2 treats those who
value equal opportunity unfairly,
diminishing the quality of our sys-
tem ofhigher education," Anthony
said.
In an article published yester-
day in the Detroit News, Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette
said the ban on affirmative action
is rooted in constitutional values
of equality.
"Ourtcitizens approved an
amendment to ensure everyone
has equal opportunity under the
law," Schuette told the News,

pledging to defend the amend-
ment in court.
Jennifer Gratz - awoman from
Southgate, Mich. who successfully
sued the University in 1997 for its
former admissions process that
gave points based on racial back-
ground, and was ruled unconstitu-
tional by the U.S. Supreme Court
in the 2003 case Gratz v. Bollinger
- told the News that she thinks
the ban will be upheld.
"I believe that court will move
swiftly to reverse the three-panel
decision and uphold the will of the
voters of Michigan," Gratz said.
Gratz said the ban against affir-
mative action has strong legal
standing.
"There isn't a legal scholar that
I have spoken with that has indi-
cated that the ruling was faulty,"
Gratz said, according to the News.
"It takes way too much mental
gymnastics to saythat ending race
preferences is discriminatory and
I believe that ruling was extreme-
ly faulty."
The University, which is a
named defendant in the case,
declined to comment on the
appeal.

a commitment to integrity,"
McCormack said. "I would have
in mind all of the work I've done
on behalf of clients over the years
trying to get justice."
McCormack has received a
number of awards during her
time at the University, including
the Detroit & Michigan National
Lawyers Guild Award in 2012,
the Patriot Award from the
Washtenaw County Bar Asso-
ciation in 2011 and the Justice
for All Award from the Criminal
Defense Attorneys of Michigan
in 2010.
She has also run clinics dealing
with general litigation, domestic
violence and ethics in order to
provide practical experience for
students in the Law School.

In 2009, McCormack founded
the Michigan Innocence Clinic,
which uses non-DNA evidence
to prove wrongful accusations
of individuals convicted in
Michigan courts. The Clinic has
worked to exonerate five sus-
pects in its three years of exis-
tence.
McCormack said the clinic is
intended to provide justice and
public security when the justice
system is unable to do so.
"One of the hopes of the work
of the clinic is to show the ways
in which - when the justice sys-
tem gets it wrong - communities
are less safe and none of us are
better off," McCormack said.
Kimberly Thomas, a clinical
professor of law, said if elected,
McCormack's presence will be
greatly missed at the University
since she would have to resign
from her position to remain

impartial as a justice.
"(McCormack) puts anempha-
sis on getting students to look
hard and think for themselves,"
Thomas said. "She has made a
positive impact on the faculty."
Paul Reingold, a clinical pro-
fessor of law, said McCormack's
persistence and ambition are
valuable assets in her campaign.
"She has worked very hard to
get the nomination. If she gets it,
her hard work will pay off, and it
will give her a leg up in the cam-
paign," Reingold said.
Law School student Jus-
tin Benson wrote in an e-mail
interview that McCormack
would provide useful insight and
knowledge to the Court.
"Given that she is co-director
of the Innocence Clinic, I believe
that she may bring a perspective
to the bench that I believe is lack-
ing," Benson wrote.

Defense Secretary
warns against
involvement in
unrest
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Defense Secretary Leon Panet-
ta pushed back on Wednesday
against fresh demands for U.S.
military involvement in Syria
to end President Bashar Assad's
deadly crackdown on his people.
"What doesn't make sense is
to take unilateral action right

about advising President Barack
Obama to dispatch U.S. forces.
"I've got to make very sure we
know what the mission is ...
achieving that mission at what
price."
The panel's top Republican,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
said the estimated 7,500 dead
and the bloodshed calls for U.S.
leadership that a Democratic
president, Bill Clinton, dis-
played during the Bosnian war
in the 1990s and that Obama
eventually showed on Libya last
year.
"In past situations, America
has led. We're not leading, Mr.
Secretary," McCaintold Panetta.
The Pentagon chief later
added that the United States is
not holding back and is leading
in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and
the war on terrorism.

Top-heavy Big Ten begins tournament,

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
With only one team truly on
the bubble, the 2012 Big Ten
Tournament has fewer implica-
tions on the NCAA Tournament
field than last year.
The conference is top heavy,
and this weekend's tournament in
Indianapolis will have more to do
with how the Big Ten's elite will
position themselves for an NCAA
seed, rather than which teams
will get into the tournament.
Only Northwestern is on the
brink - hoping to reach its first
tournament in school history -
and is facing perhaps the most
pressure of any Big Ten team this
weekend.
Looking out for No.1
Michigan State picked a bad
time to hit the skids. After being
in control of the conference for
most of the season, the eighth-
ranked Spartans lost two straight
games to close the year, and Ohio
State and Michigan won their last
two to draw even and tie for a con-
ference championship.
This slide could be cause for
worry, as the postseason is not
an ideal time for a team to head
south (except for this year, when
the Final Four is in New Orleans),
but it might not be so bad. The
back end of Michigan State's
schedule included a visit to Indi-
ana - which had beaten now-No.
1 Kentucky and then-No. 1 Ohio
State in Assembly Hall - as well
as a contest with the Buckeyes.
To add injury to insult, fresh-
man guard Branden Dawson -
the team's third-leading scorer
- was lost for the season (and
likely next season) to a knee inju-
ry last weekend. Still, the Spar-

tans have the top seed in the Big
Ten Tournament and are looking
to vault themselves to the top of
the NCAA field.
Best case: No. 1 seed in the
NCAA Tournament.
Worst case: No. 3 seed in the
NCAA Tournament.
Ohio State was the runaway
favorite to win the conference at
the start of the year, and though
the Buckeyes did win a share of
the title, they performed well
below expectations. Whether
because of a reduced support-
ing cast or simply for lack of
improvement, star forward Jared
Sullinger leveled off this season
and lacked dominance at times.
It's been Deshaun Thomas that's
stepped up and carried the Buck-
eye offense for much of the year.
Still, No. 7 Ohio State has the
toughest frontcourt in the confer-
ence, and when guard William
Buford's shot is on, the Buckeyes

can be the most dominant team
in the Big Ten. A No. 1 seed is still
within reach if Ohio State wins
the tournament this weekend, but
the Buckeyes will likely settle for
a two-seed.
Best case: No. 1 seed in the
NCAA Tournament.
Worst case: No. 3 seed in the
NCAA Tournament.
Not much to lose, not much to
win
A year ago, Michigan had to
sweat out Selection Sunday, but
this year's team can rest easy. The
Wolverines won a share of the Big
Ten and look to be headed for a
No.3 seed.
On Feb. 25, the Wolverines'
title hopes seemed to be dashed
when Purdue came in on senior
night and gave Michigan its first
home loss of the season. At that
point, the Wolverines needed to
win out and would need a lot of
help to attain their goal of win-

ning a conference championship.
In a series of games that usu-
ally are left to fantasy, the breaks
went Michigan's way and a soft
late-season schedule brought
the Wolverines their first banner
since 1989.
Michigan would likely jump
to a two-seed by winning the Big
Ten Tournament, while a winless
weekend might bump the Wolver-
ines down a notch.
Best case: No. 2 seed in the
NCAA Tournament.
Worst case: No. 4 seed in the
NCAA Tournament.
Wisconsin looked like it might
be headed for the NCAA bubble
early in the Big Ten season. Fol-
lowing a blowout loss to Michi-
gan, the 14th-ranked Badgers
had lost three straight and were
uncharacteristically shaky at
home. But order was restored and
Bo Ryan took the Badgers to a
fourth-place finish. Senior Jordan

Taylor regressed from last year,
but Wisconsin is still able to grind
down top competition.
The Badgers don't seem to have
peaked this season and the post-
season may treat them very well.
Best case: No. 3 seed in the
NCAA Tournament.
Worse case: No. 6 seed in the
NCAA Tournament.
Indiana has masqueraded as an
elite team, beating three top-10
opponents this year,but ithas also
had trouble away from Assembly
Hall. This weekend will provide
something in-between home and
the road, as the tournament will
be held in Indianapolis. But the
15th-ranked Hoosiers could sur-
prise as a five-seed, especially if
its hot-and-cold shooters start
boiling.
Best case: No. 3 seed in NCAA
Tournament.
Worst case: No. 6 seed in
NCAA Tournament.
In and around the bubble
Purdue should ease into the
NCAA Tournament, but a first-
round loss to Nebraska could
shake things up.
Robbie Hummel has been on
fire lately, and Purdue may be
nearing its peak.
Best case: No. 6 seed in the
NCAA Tournament.
Worst case: Barely sneaks in.
Northwestern is ever-so-close
to letting coach Bill Carmody
answer questions about some-
thing other than the fact that
the Wildcats have never reached
the Big Dance. One win will put
Northwestern square on the
bubble and a second win against
Michigan should put the them in.
Best case: In the NCAA Tour-
nament.
Worst case: NIT.

'M' reports
potential
violation
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily SportsEditor
The Michigan football team
picked up its 14th commitment of
the 2013 class on Tuesday - line-
backer Mike McCray from Trot-
wood, Ohio - but the compliance
department was later alerted to
two possible minor recruiting vio-
lations made by wide receiver Roy
Roundtree and linebacker Kenny
Demens.
Both instances occurred on the
players' Twitter accounts.
Roundtree is an alum of
McCray's high school, Trotwood-
Madison High School. On Tues-
day, he tweeted congratulations to
the recruit.
"S/O to my lil brotha Mike
McCray @MJM92013 for com-
mitting to Michigan today,"
Roundtree wrote.
Later, Demens followed suit.
"@MJM92013 Welcome to the
Maize & Blue my dog," Demens
tweeted.
Both tweets have since been
deleted. The Twitterspeak, how-
ever innocuous it seems, is in
violation of an NCAA rule that
prohibits players connected to a
program from contacting recruits
before National Signing Day.
"NCAA rules do not allow com-
ments about possible recruits on
an institution's social media page
or a page belonging to someone
affiliated with the institution," the
NCAA rule states. "In addition,
these pages cannot feature photos
of prospects and messages can-
not be sent to recruits using these
social media technologies other
than through their e-mail func-
tion."
Notre Dame ran into similar
trouble last week, when tight end
Tyler Eifert tweeted his impres-
sions of a recruit thatvisited South
Bend. The Fighting Irish reported
the potential violation.
The violations by Michigan and
Notre Dame are not expected to
earn much of a punishment.
A message seeking comment
from the NCAA has not received
a response.
2013 class
ranks high
with Scout
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
DailySportsEditor
The Michigan football team
scored big in Scout.com's first
ranking of the top-300 2013
recruits in the nation.
The Wolverines, who have
already picked up 14 commit-
ments for the 2013 recruiting
class, saw 12 of those commits
land on the top-300 list. The only
other school to reach double-
digit recruits was Texas (11).
Three members of the class
- offensive lineman Patrick

Kugler, quarterback Shane Mor-
ris and safety Dymonte Thomas
- earned five-star rankings from
Scout.
The Longhorns are the only
other program with multiple
five-star commits (2).
Most notable is that while
Michigan had 12 recruits in the
top-300, the rest of the Big Ten
fielded just eight total commits.
Ohio State had five, while Michi-
gan State, Nebraska and Penn
State each picked up one.
It appears the battle is back
on: The Little Ten and the Big
Two.
The individual rankings of
each Michigan ranked commit,
per Scout:
MICHIGAN, 12 recruits:
Kugler (No. 25), Morris (28),

Michigan loses first varsity
lacrosse match in Ann Arbor

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Senior defenseman Greg Pateryn has been a steady presence on the blue line for Michigan this season.
SPateryn finds balance as
Blue's defensive anchor

By SCOTT FREEDMAN
For the Daily
The Michigan men's lacrosse
squad suffered a tough defeat in
the newly minted varsity pro-
gram's first
home game LOYOLA 15
Wednesday MICHIGAN 8
night.
The 15-8 loss against No. 9
Loyola (Md.) leaves Michigan
coach John Paul and the Wol-
verines at 1-6 approaching the
halfway point of the season.
Despite the loss, Paul was
pleased by the effort from his
team.
"We came in knowing that
this was going to be a really
challenging season, with what
we had coming in, to get wins,"
Paul said.
"And so we didn't make that
our goal. Our goal is to set the
stage for what our program is
going to be."
Michigan jumped out to an
early 1-0 lead, but Loyola, led
by a five-goal performance from
junior Mike Sawyer, quickly
reclaimed control. The Grey-
hounds went on an eight-goal
run after initially trailing.
Loyola led, 8-2, at the half in
Ann Arbor.
Re-energized by an offensive
upsurge in the third quarter, the
Wolverines brought the game
within five goals on a strike by
midfielder Willie Steenland
early in the fourth.
But Loyola's 42 shots - and
two goals coming in 50 seconds
as the clock wound down -
proved overwhelming for Mich-
igan freshman goalkeeper Emil
Weiss.
Loyola certainly dominated
the stat sheet, outclassing the
Wolverines in every major cate-
gory, including faceoffs, ground
balls, turnovers, and an impres-
sive 4-for-4 on man-up opportu-
nities.
Michigan has faced a tough
schedule so far this year, com-
prising six consecutive road
games to start the year.
The Wolverines finally had
their first official home game
as a varsity program in front
of a crowd of nearly 500 at the
Oosterbaan Fieldhouse.
"It felt good to play in front
of the hometown crowd," said

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Watch senior defenseman
Greg Pateryn during any of his
shifts for the Michigan hockey
team, and your body will wince
every time his 216-pound frame
slams into the boards.
It's not Pateryn you feel bad
for. It's the unfortunate oppo-
nent on the receiving end of one
of his blows.
The defensive corps takes
pride in Pateryn's brute force on
the ice.
Having smart, puck-moving
defensemen is important - hav-
ing someone who's not scared to
get a little physical is even more
so.
"(Physicality) is one of his
strengths," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "He's got that
mentality. Some of the big guys
don't want to play too physical
because they might hurt some-
body. Pateryn isn't that way."
t Not all of the aggressive-
ness comes naturally - to some
degree, the mindset has been
instilled in him through coach-
ing, as Pateryn was taught to be
"the meanest kid on the ice."
"I played for (Michigan State
defenseman) Torey Krug's dad
growing up," Pateryn said. "He
was always a really high-intensi-
ty guy, never took anything from
anyone.
"(He) put that mentality in

Martha Cook brings international cuisine to annual event.

by John Bohn
Daily Arts Writer

it's the main hallway you notice first. The unobserv-
ant may miss the elaborate gothic carving of Shake-
speare's Portia above the entrance, and it's probably
best to keep your head forward on South U anyway. But
once you're inside, it's the main hallway that strikes you:
high-vaulted ceilings leading to a replica sculpture of the
Venus de Milo; the tall, Gothic, framed windows to the
left overlooking a terrace and rolling lawn; the elegant
Gold Room to the right where the Elizabethan and Jaco-
bean drama blazes an autumnal hue.
It's a place of dandy dreams, of nostalgia for experi-
ences this generation never had, of an era we can only
catch glimpses of through the films of classic Hollywood
or the novels of Fitzgerald. And it's here that every Fri-
day, Martha Cook, an all-female residence hall, hosts an
afternoon tea.

ronistic style of" "Usually it's food.

have an escort (a
fact commonly mis-
understood in public gossip), it's only on the day of the
International Tea that the hall, one of the four remain-
ing all-female housing options at the University, opens
its doors to the public. On this day, the usual English-
summer-home quaintness of Martha Cook is energized
by the radiance of diverse cultures far and wide.
From Gold Room to the Philippines
After experiencing the initial awe that comes with
the firststep into Martha Cook, those invited to a typical
Friday tea will first pass the hors d'oeuvres table in the
main hallway, where the ornate tableware would blend
in with the surrounding decor if not for the assortment
of foods laid upon it. To get a beverage, enter the Gold
Room, where you have a choice of either atea of the day
or a fruit juice from one of the two girls serving with
ornamental cups and kettle. Depending on the formal-
ity of the affair, the Gold Room could be filled with an
ensemble of well-dressed residents and their guests.
There is also the adjoining Red Room, named for its
red color scheme, which is just as elegantly furnished
as the Gold Room. The Red Room, however, has a per-

sonal touch: a large portrait of Martha Cook herself, the
grandmother of building architect William Cook. And
while it's impossible to literally dress up this Martha
Cook for International Tea, the building is still able to
pay the homage to her name.
Tomorrow, residents of Martha Cook will host vari-
ous tables featuring the food of aparticular country.TThis
year, the event is organized by Art & Design senior and
Martha Cook resident Elaine Czech. As Ethnic Council
Chairwoman on Martha Cook's Student Board, Czech
is in charge of planning a variety of ethnic events for
the dorm such as movies, dances and trips to museums:
International Tea is the largest eventshe is in charge of.
"It's usually a well-oiled machine," Czech said. "We
do this every year, and everything is so set in place."

Not only does this event align with the University's
overall philosophy of multicultural awareness, but it
also gives the residents of MarthaCook a chance to show
their rich heritages.
"A lot of people like to do a country they are from,"
Czech said. "Freshman year, I did Malta. That's where
my heritage is from. Last year, my friend and I did the
Philippines. She had a family friend cook authentic Fili-
pino food."
For Nursing freshman Meghan Conger, it was a sur-
prise to find that Italy had not been represented in two
or three years. Italian herself, Conger was prompted by
this fact to sign up for a table to represent her family's
heritage this year. At the Italiantable, she willbe provid-

ARTS RECOMMENDS
In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.
"All the President's Men"
Super Tuesday and the hoopla surrounding the
Republican primaries really puts you in the mood
for a good old political thriller. "All the President's
Men," the breathtaking and devious take on the
Watergate scandal, provides dirty politics mixed
with some inspiring investigative journalism. Plus,
fabulous performances from Dustin Hoffman and
Robert Redford make this an instant classic.
WARNER BROS.
Hunky Dory - David Bowie
Hunky Dory is an album that's silly, lovely and
tragic all at the same time, with tracks ranging
from hopeful pop tunes to acoustic heartbreakers.
Yet they all somehow flow effortlessly, tied together
by Bowie's dynamic voice and soulful piano play-
ing. It's an album about uncertainty, with Bowie
singing about lamentingthe past, being uncomfort-
able with the present and unclear about the future.
_______Who can't relate to that these days?
RCA
"Dune" - Frank Herbert
Missing the beach after a sunny spring break?
Escape back to the sandy paradises of last week's
much-needed hiatus with "Dune." Frank Her-
bert's classic may have been published when your
parents were toddlers, but it's far from dated. Fol-
low Paul Atreides as he struggles to survive in a
strange land - and don't forget: "The spice must
flow."
ACE TRADE
"How to Make it in America"
You're probably done with midterms. Now it's
back to those desperate last-minute applications
for internships and jobs. If that's you, HBO's "How
to Make It in America" is perfect procrastination
material. It's derided by many as too "Entourage"-
esque, but the sitcom about young hustlers trying
to make it in New York's fashion game isn't tit-
filled feel-goodery, but a motivating story of ideal-
istic struggle.

Ten Thousand Villages volunteer
How did you start volunteering at Ten Thousand Villages?
I actually came in as a customer. I spoke with the manager and
the staff and I was really intrigued. Having parents that are
missionaries, I wanted to get involved, and this was a really good
way to do it.
What do you like about volunteering?
It's really fun to learn about the people that make the products, the
organizations and even the countries they come from.

A storefront of fair-trade culture in A2

Ten Thousand
Villages stocks
artisan handicrafts
By NICOLE SAVITSKY
DailyArts Writer
Nestled between fine eateries
and other distinctive boutiques,
Ten Thousand Villages is a fair-
trade retailer that sells artisan-
crafted home decor, personal
accessories and gift items from
across the globe. Featuring prod-
ucts from more than 130 artisan
groups in some 38 countries, the
Main Street store is part of a net-
work of over 390 retail outlets
throughout the United States
selling fairly-traded products.
Ten Thousand Villages, which
stems from a project birthed in
the basements of churches, has a
title that doesn't always resonate
at first encounter. But if one has
any background knowledge about
fair trade, Ten Thousand Vil-
lages, the oldest fair trade retailer
in North America, may inspire a
compelling visit.
Fair trade is an organized social
movement and market-based
technique that aims to help pro-
ducers in developing countries
create better trading conditions
and promote sustainability, advo-
cating the payment of a higher
price to exporters as well as the
establishment of higher social
and environmental standards.
* Most notable fairly-traded items
found in the United States are
handicrafts, coffee, cocoa, sugar,
tea, bananas, honey, cotton, wine,
fresh fruit, chocolate, flowers and
gold.
Now in its 66th year, the com-
pany still attempts to uphold
these values. In 1946, while trav-
eling in Puerto Rico, Mennonite
Missionaries encountered women
weaving elaborate table linens
and inquired about where they
could be bought and sold. They
returned to eastern Pennsylvania

with these treasures in hand, and
friends of the missionaries were
captivated and wanted to place
their orders for the next visit.
These missionaries later founded
the first Ten Thousand Villages
location in Bluffton, Ohio.
"At that moment, a light bulb
went (on)," said Bill Henderson,
the Main Street store manager.
"These people could become a
direct conduit from artisan to
consumer and cut out the mid-
dleman, allowing the artisan to
make more money for the delicate
work they put in."
Ten Thousand Villages has
cultivated trading relationships
in which artisans receive a fair
price for their work and con-
sumers gain access to distinctive
handcrafted items. Seeking to
establish long-term buying rela-
tionships in places where skilled
artisans who are under- or unem-
ployed lack other opportunities
for income, their network helps
struggling artisan groups who
are in need of assistance.
In Cambodia, for example,
people are shunned for their
imperfections, even those result-
ing from being maimed by land
mines or other such types of
devices. Artisans who belong to
this maligned group compose
jewelry and accessories out of the
bombshells and materials that
brought about their disfiguration.
Other artisan groups, such as
those in India, consist of women
rescued from human traffick-
ing who make recycled saris as
an outlet to help them cope with
their trauma.
Despite this solemn back-
ground to certain kinds of fairly-
traded items, when a customer
enters the Ten Thousand Villages
in Ann Arbor, the background
music and clamor of customers
evoke worldly vibes of serenity,
and the message is digested: "Our
mission is to promote dignity,
hope and a living wage for arti-
sans around the world by selling
their handicrafts, by telling their

stories and by educating locally
about Fair Trade," reads the com-
pany's mission statement.
Henderson explained that the
aim is not to bombard the cli-
ent with fair trade information,
but instead to whet their appe-
tite with the sounds and colors
that greet them. The direction is
to educate the community about
what it means to sell fairly-traded
products, but it is important that
the customer seeks this education
out first.
"We like to combine the
process of selling and telling,
connecting stories with the prod-
ucts," Henderson said.
In that vein, goods found
throughout the venue have expla-
nations above them stating mes-
sages such as "fair trade means
Guillermina Salome and Eulogio
Medina can share their cultural
heritage."
Wind-chime mobiles from
Cambodia prove a popular seller,
utilizing only wood scraps so
that no livingtrees are harmed in
their composition. Pieced togeth-
er through recycling, flowerpots
are sculpted using pre-consumer
waste of candy-wrapper excess
from factory floors.
Henderson's favorite gift idea
involves recycled paper place-
mats used to satisfy the tradi-
tional first-anniversary gift of
"paper," once again telling and
selling more than one story.
Thoughstudents are not alarge
part of the foottraffic through the
store, Ten Thousand Villages has
participated in fair trade fashion
shows on the Diag and has associ-
ated with the ethnic restaurants
during Taste of Ann Arbor.
The Ann Arbor location, enter-
ing its eighth year of residency
this fall, was developed by local
individuals who wanted to help
support the fair trade movement
and began to raise money through
festival sales and various startup
committees. Other Ten Thou-
sand Villages locations across the
country supported the hunt for

a retail space by donating money
until the location could stand on
its own. The Ann Arbor shop does
the same for burgeoninglocations,
and it donates to other non-profit
retailers throughout the city.
Henderson began as a volun-
teer, as most employees do, but
decided to put his extensive retail
background to use, attaining
the position of event coordina-
tor. This allowed him to educate
the community about fair trade,
before rising to his current mana-
gerial status.
"The important thing is to
find something you're passionate
about and turn that passion into
an opportunity," Henderson said.
Deeply rooted interests in
crafting are not necessary in
order to find meaning in this
business. Before joining Ten
Thousand Villages, Henderson
attended workshops about trans-
forming one's interests into busi-
ness opportunities. Starting a
new business can be a daunting
task, but with his love of retail,
Henderson essentially became a
business coach, helping develop-
ing countries turn their lifestyles
into a source of income.
The items on sale at Ten Thou-

sand Villages demonstrates how
crafting can reflect the culture,
tradition and history of a place,
existent long after the culture
has undergone contemporary
transformations. Though it gives
expression to imagination and
creativity, the art of crafting may
appear to be fading away because
it entails a painstaking amount
of handiwork and devotion -
however, new media affirms that
handcrafting is growing in popu-
larity.
Websites like Etsy.com attempt
to empower people to change the
way the global economy works,
building relationships in a vir-
tual handmade marketplace that
reconnects producers with con-
sumers. Attempting to take the
antiquated aspect out of crafting,
Etsy recognizes that people value
authorship and provenance as
much as price and convenience,
thereby "bringing heart to com-
merce and making the world
more fair, more sustainable and
more fun," according to the Etsy.
com website.
"It's all new to me, but it seems
like (Etsy shares) a common goal
- we both want to connect buyers
with sellers, but we also hope to

improve that seller's standard of
living," Henderson said.
Social media and the Internet
succeed in spreading awareness
about the products that Ten Thou-
sand Villages houses, but Hender-
son remains firm that the physical
stores aren'tgoing anywhere. Peo-
ple want to touch, feel and look at
the product, so he only keeps two
of everything, presenting the cus-
tomer with a personal choice: "It's
all handmade, so whichone doyou
want?" Henderson said.
Art fairs and other exhibitors
will often seek involvement with
the store, but they must be certi-
fied fair trade. Fair trade in the
North American marketplace is
still small, however, so there is
a window for further education.
Ten Thousand Villages' next
project aims to organize a coali-
tion with the Ann Arbor City
Council, proposing to declare
Ann Arbor asa fair trade city. Not
onlywill thisbringTen Thousand
Villages to the forefront of the
leading fair trade retailers, but it
will also raise awareness of what
- in addition to the artwork it
houses - is currently available in
the community that is also fairly
traded.

TEA TIME
From Page 1B
herfoodfromtheEuro Marketon
Packard. With a variety of East-
ern European foods, Euro Market
offers a truly authentic Russian
culinary experience. So authen-
tic, in fact, that Achtenberg's
figure-skating coach - who orig-
inally tipped her off to the Euro
Market and is from Russia her-
self - has to translate the labels
for her since they are written in
Cyrillic. Others in years past have
had the food catered from an eth-
nic restaurant. When such food is
harder to find, the Martha Cook
dining hall can provide it.
When asked what kinds of tea
the tables serve, Czech respond-
ed, "Usually, it's food. The ironic
part of International Tea is that
rarelyis there ever tea served."
Making the tradition
Tea was served, though, back
when International Tea was more
like a regular Friday tea instead
of the big event it has become. As
Czech explained, many of Mar-
tha Cook's traditions start out as
small events that gradually grow
in size and prominence within
the hall community. Interna-
tional Tea is an example of such
a process.
International Tea has been
going on for over 40 years. While
it was originally proposed as an
educational experience for Mar-
tha Cook residents, the form of
this education has changed dras-
tically. Some of its most notable
qualities, such as itspublic nature
and its emphasis on food, were
not always there.
As 'U' alum Catherine Davis
remembers it, there was an
International Tea at least one of
her two years in Martha Cook
(1968 to 1970). It had just been
proposed by the Martha Cook
Multicultural Council, and it
amounted to card tables set up in
the hall with poster displays to
represent the countries and their
cultures. These were the old kind
of displays: 25-cent poster-board
covered with cut-out magazine
pictures and hand-lettering. The

The Gold Room is one of the elegant spaces in which International Tea will take place.

food wasn't culturally specific,
remaining the same as the serv-
ings of a normal Friday afternoon
tea. All of this was intended as
an educational experience exclu-
sively for the residents of Martha
Cook.
Flash forward four decades,
and the event has turned into a
tradition with authentic food,
personal histories and some-
times even a sense of humor. Last
year, LSA senior Emma Lawton
decided to do atable on the Great
Lakes. She served water. It was
just tap water, but she reasoned
that all tap water in Michigan
comes from the Great Lakes
Basin. And while the Great Lakes
are pretty close to home, home
is a rather complicated concept.
This year, Lawton will do a table
on San Marino, a small, land-
locked country on the eastern
Italian peninsula. Through a San
Marino state law, Lawton, whose
grandfather was born in San
Marino, was able to become a cit-
izen of the small state whose cul-
ture has had so much influence on
her family and upbringing.
"(International Tea) is a way
to share what's going on in San
Marino," Lawton said. "It's a very
small country, one most people
haven't heard about, but it's very
important to me because my fam-

ily is from there and it's some-
thingI grew up with."
A local treat called tizzelle cui-
sine will represent San Marino.
"It's a type of cookie," Lawton
said. "A wafer that you make in a
waffle bowl."
Lawton described tizzelle as
being easy to make for 500 peo-
ple, which is good, as Interna-
tional Tea has attracted such a
high number in recent years.
In addition to the food, there
can be demonstrations of repre-
sented countries' art and culture.
At the San Marino table, one will
find the San Marino flag as well
as its ceramics and pottery, an art
the country is known for.
"My family actually owns a
pottery factory in San Marino,"
Lawton said. "SoI have examples
of plates you would see, the tradi-
tional kind of pottery."
In years past, Chinese art dis-
plays, Mexican folk dances, Tae
Kwon Do demonstrations and
bagpipe performances have all
helped create the diverse atmo-
sphere of the event. This year,
Czech plans to have a projector
display of international danc-
ing and music to fill the build-
ing with an ethnic flare, which
will either be colorfully foreign
or familiar, depending on the
event-goer.
Fashion parades, Scottish
kilts and more
In an attempt to bridge the
cultural distance between the
United States and the rest of
the world, International Tea
at Martha Cook traditionally
provided the local area with a
globally aware and education-
ally rich event. By 1990. the

event was beginning to resemble
its current incarnation.
"I remember it being a big deal,
but probably not as big a deal as
it is now," wrote 'U' alum Beth
Yaros Johnston in a statement.
"There was usually a lot of food
with some dancing. I remember
opening it up to the campus but
it was mostly friends of residents,
although it was always pretty
crowded."
During the past five years, rep-
resenting culture through food
has become the main focus of the
event, according to Martha Cook
Director Marion Law.
Holding the position of direc-
tor since 1997, Law has seen
quite a few spectacles at Interna-
tional Tea, from women in fash-
ion parades bearing the national
dress of a country to a great vari-
ety of musical and dance groups
like Korean drummers or Czech
dancers. Of course, everyone has
their favorites.
"Personally, I enjoy my hus-
band Dave having the opportu-
nity to wear his kilt while helping
to serve haggis to dubious guests
at the Scottish table," wrote Law
in a statement.
Tomorrow from 3 p.m. to 5
p.m., the main hallway of Martha
Cook will be lined with flags of
many nations as the Gold and Red
Rooms are filled by the scents and
sensibilities of 18 different coun-
tries. The tables of the countries
represented this year - Russia,
Poland, San Marino, Ireland, Sin-
gapore, India, Antarctica, Arme-
nia, Sweden, Germany, Italy,
Finland, Switzerland, Argentina,
Basque Region (Spain), England,
Albania and Scotland - will each
celebrate, with their own part
and parcel. humanity's diversity.
