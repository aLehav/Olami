Former factory 

worker emphasizes 

importance of 

monitoring

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

At a speak-out Monday, Noi 

Supalai, former union president 
and garment worker from Bangkok, 
Thailand, addressed a group of 
students to share her experience as 
an employee at a Thai factory where 
she produced Nike apparel.

The event was hosted by the 

campus chapter of United Students 
Against 
Sweatshops 
to 
raise 

awareness about proper oversight 
of apparel factories overseas,

In 
November 
2015, 
Nike 

announced it would stop allowing 
independent inspectors, such as 
the Worker Rights Consortium, to 
monitor work conditions in Nike 
apparel factories. Instead, the 
company said it would internally 
self-monitor its own activities — a 
decision that groups like USAS have 

said they fear will lead to potential 
worker abuse.

Morgan 
Currier, 
USAS 

International 
Campaigns 

Coordinator, began the speak-out 
with an interactive exercise, asking 
the attendees to think critically 
about the role students play in 
perpetuating the abuse of foreign 
laborers and ways in which they 
can improve worker conditions. 
She said institutions such as the 
University of Michigan, by signing 
contracts with brands like Nike, 
indirectly allow such practices to 
continue to exist. The University’s 
Athletic Department signed an 
apparel deal with Nike in 2015 that 
does not expire until 2027.

“We believe that we should only 

be doing business with brands who 
respect the rights of their workers,” 
Currier said. “What we do in USAS 
is we support the organizing efforts 
of workers around the world. We 
don’t believe in charity; we believe 
in solidarity.”

Jasmine Rand 
delivers remarks 
for Diversity and 
Inclusion Week

By MADELEINE GERSON

Daily Staff Repoter 

Jasmine Rand, the attorney for 

the families of Trayvon Martin, 
Michael 
Brown 
and 
Tamir 

Rice, spoke at the University of 
Michigan Monday, discussing 
her work work on racial relations 
in the United States and human 
rights activism.

Rand, a professor at University 

of Miami School of Law, is also 
active in civil rights movements 
and was recognized by the 
National Bar Association as one 
of the top 40 lawyers under 40 in 
the nation in 2013.

The event is one of several 

this week sponsored by the 

Greek 
Life 
Diversity 
and 

Inclusion Task Force, Central 
Student Government and the 
Black Business Undergraduate 
Society as part of a campus-wide 
Diversity and Inclusion Week.

During her remarks, Rand 

emphasized how her personal 
background 
and 
experiences 

led her to discover her passion 
for law and commitment to 
advocating for underrepresented 
communities. 

“I am a first generation high 

school graduate,” Rand said. “I 
was born to a teenage mother. 
Do not judge me by my successes. 
Judge me by the number of times 
I fell down and stood back up 
again. Do not judge me by the 
number of times I have appeared 
on CNN.”

Rand told the audience that she 

believes social justice is an issue 
relevant to all careers and fields 
of study.

“It 
doesn’t 
matter

Lauren Southern 
and Cathy Young 
condemn First 

Amendment abuse

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Cathy 
Young, 
Reason 

Magazine 
contributing 

editor, and Lauren Southern, 
Canadian 
journalist 
and 

activist, came to the Michigan 
League 
Monday 
night 
to 

present a joint lecture on free 
speech on college campuses. 
Both Young and Southern 
ultimately 
defended 
the 

importance 
of 
what 
they 

characterized as the often 
abused First Amendment right.

Hosted by the Michigan 

Review, Young and Southern 
gave a talk titled “Fighting 
the Speech Police.” The event 
was attended by about 60 
people, including students and 
community members.

Young 
spoke 
first 
at 

the 
event, 
discussing 
her 

experience 
coming 
of 
age 

in the Soviet Union and the 
ways Russia restricts radical 
and controversial free speech. 
She connected the country 
to college cmpuses, saying 
the necessity to conform to 
dominant ideology is prevalent 
and reminds her of the strict 
conditions for free speech in 
the Soviet Union.

In particular, Young cited 

recent incidents such as a recent 
occurrence at Yale University. 

Former Yale official Erica 
Christakis sent out an e-mail 
to students saying warnings on 
showing appropriate cultural 
sensitivity in the selection of 
Halloween costumes were too 
restrictive, sparking backlash 
that ultimately led to her 
resigning from her position.

“We are not talking simply 

about 
disagreement; 
we’re 

talking about punishing people 
who voice their own kind of 
speech,” Young said. “When 
they restrict speech based on 
its ideological content, as I 
think has been documented, 
there’s a blatant use of double 
standards 
with 
regard 
to 

left-wing 
and 
right-wing 

inflammatory 
comments. 

This certainly promotes the 
view that these ideas are not 
legitimate speech.”

Young 
said 
she 
thinks 

certain forms of expression 
should be excluded as free 
speech, especially viewpoints 
that are generally considered 
unacceptable 
in 
society. 

However, she warned these 
selective 
restrictions 
could 

cause problems later on.

“When we make the decision 

to stigmatize certain ideas, we 
should be very, very careful to 
draw the circle of ideas which 
are considered beyond the pale 
very, very narrowly, so that 
we don’t end up stigmatizing 
legitimate ideas,” Young said.

Southern, 
in 
contrast 

outlined 
a 
more 
radical 

approach 
to 
free 
speech. 

She said there should be no 
restrictions for speech, even

SACUA says 
ART 2.0 could 
perpetuate poor 
faculty relations

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan’s 

release 
of 
course 
evaluation 

data continued to be a topic 
of 
controversial 
discussion 

among 
faculty 
at 
Monday’s 

Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs meeting.

On Friday, the University 

relaunched a tool initially only 
available to faculty, ART 2.0, 
which 
now 
allows 
students 

to see select data from course 
evaluations for University classes. 
The launch came after months of 
dispute following the University’s 
initial announcement that they 
were exploring releasing the 
data, which drew significant 
pushback 
from 
faculty 
over 

concerns of bias and misuse. Joint 
committees of SACUA members 
and Central Student Government 
representatives 
have 
been 

working over the past few months 
in an effort to mitigate the 
concerns, and recommended the 
release of the data with several 
stipulations in February. How 
many of those stipulations will 
be followed with the University’s 
tool wasn’t clear Monday.

At the meeting, Physics Prof. 

Gus Evrard, team leader for ART 
2.0, said the release of course 
evaluations with the tool aims

Students emphasize 
need for religious 

tolerance at 

gathering on Diag

By TIM COHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Monday night, more than 70 

students attended a vigil held 
by Michigan Pakistanis after 
a suicide bombing Sunday in 
Lahore, Pakistan, left at least 72 
civilians killed and more than 
300 injured.

The vigil attendees included 

students 
affiliated 
with 

Michigan Pakistanis as well as 
other University of Michigan 
students. LSA junior Shahrooz 
Ali, who was not a Michigan 
Pakistanis member, noted the 
event was an opportunity for 
students to come together to 
mourn in solidarity.

“What happened on Sunday 

was an unnecessary act that 
left 
those 
innocent 
lives 

murdered,” Ali said. “Those 
people were just at the park, 
celebrating a day of God with 
their families. As a Muslim, I do 
not understand the reason why 
the bombers felt it necessary 
to commit this crime. Islam 
preaches a message of peace, 
for all people to come together, 

and love each other.”

During the vigil, student 

members 
of 
Michigan 

Pakistanis spoke about the 
impact of the suicide bombing. 
President 
of 
Michigan 

Pakistanis Eman Hijab, an 
LSA junior, told the crowd 
it was important to not be 
desensitized 
to 
senseless 

acts of violence like Sunday’s 
bombing.

“At a time when hope has 

diminished, faith in humanity 
weakened and overwhelming 
grief pervades, we stand in unity 
with one another.” Hijab said. 
“We must remind ourselves 
to never become complacent

From organizations focusing on 

social justice to students who like 
boxing, Mason Hall was filled with 
students aiming to raise awareness 
about what their groups offer the 
campus community on Monday.

LSA senior Elise Jayakar was 

tabling for Intergroup Relations, 
an organization within the 
University of Michigan that works 
to involve students and faculty in 
discussions about gender, sexuality, 
socioeconomic background and 
race. Jayakar, who is pursuing an 
IGR minor, said the group hopes to 
engage interest from students.

She said she believes it is 

important for students to get 

involved in IGR to understand 
various identities that exist on 
campus.

“I think what we’re hoping is 

that more people get involved, and 
also that social identities become 
something that’s on peoples’ minds,” 
she said.

IGR’s name, Jayakar added, 

may contribute to students’ lack of 
awareness about the program.

“Our title is ‘The Program on 

Intergroup Relations,’ which doesn’t 
specifically tell you it’s linked to 
social justice; we’re trying to make 
that connection so that people 
know,” she said. “When you just hear 
the name, it doesn’t really tell you 

all of that, so we’re hoping to have 
people make that connection.”

Jayakar said she strongly 

recommends getting involved in the 
program or taking a course from 
the organization due to her own 
experiences.

“Out of everything I’ve done in 

college, this is the most influential 
and most impactful thing,” she said.

The African Students Association 

also tabled Monday to sell tickets to 
and advertise for “Afrolution,” their 
18th annual cultural show on Friday. 
The show will feature music, dance, 
fashion and spoken word poetry to 
display culture from the African 
continent.

ASA Vice President Ashley 

Ogwo, an LSA senior, said the show 
aims to give the campus community 

more exposure to the continent and 
highlight the positive aspects of 
various African cultures.

“We use it as an opportunity to 

educate our audience and also give 
them a night of fun entertainment,” 
she said. “We show a variety of what 
the continent has to offer in terms of 
entertainment and also in terms of 
people and culture.”

Another group tabling in Mason, 

the UM Boxing Club, is sending 
one of its members, Social Work 
graduate student Wendy Cortes, to 
the National Boxing Championship 
in Los Angeles. However, while the 
team and the University compensate 
most of Cortes’ costs, she is still 
expected to contribute to some of the 
expenses of traveling and lodging.

The Malaysian Students Association hosts Malaysian Cultural Night, an event celebrating traditional and contemporary Malaysian culture, in the Lydia 
Mendelssohn Theater Monday.
Showcase highlights Malaysian culture 
through performances of songs, dances

Event focuses on 

clash between 

traditional values, 

modern society 

By RHEA CHEETI

For the Daily

Monday night, the Malaysian 

Students 
Association 
hosted 

Malaysian Culture Night, during 
which MSA members showcased 
various aspects of their heritage 
through a stage performance 
featuring traditional Malaysian 
songs and dances.

The performance took place in 

the Lydia Mendelssohn Theater 
in front of approximately 500 
people, featuring a play that 
focused on dreams and their 
significance in the Malaysian 
community.

LSA 
sophomore 
Zaryff 

Razali, who directed the play, 

said perceptions surrounding 
his concentration in history at 
the University of Michigan was 
the motivation for the show’s 
theme.

“I’m a history major, and 

in Malaysia, that’s something 
that people often look down 
upon. I wanted to show people, 
especially 
Malaysians, 
that 

there was a part of our history 
that we were ignoring,” he said. 
“A lot of it was my own historical 
introspection. I’m looking at all 
these facts that I just found out 
and how much I want to show it 
to everyone else as well.”

The 
play, 
written 
by 

students, 
focused 
on 
what 

happens 
when 
traditional 

values 
and 
modern 
society 

clash through the perspective 
of 
a 
typical 
Malaysian 

family. 
Event 
organizers 

said 
it 
aimed 
to 
highlight 

how 
characters’ 
thoughts, 

aspirations and goals in life 
are shaped by circumstances 

around 
them, 
using 
dream 

scenes as contrasting elements 
throughout the performance.

Dances performed during the 

event included the Lion Dance, 
which symbolizes the arrival of 
good fortune and the expulsion 
of darker forces and spirits. 
Another dance, The Bamboo 
“Buluh” Dance, is traditionally 
used to celebrate success in 
battle, but currently performed 
during festivities. It was adapted 
for the play to symbolize conflict 
and struggle.

LSA 
senior 
Muhammad 

Farqani Mohd Noor, who acted 
as an emcee for the event and 
performed in one of the dances 
during the play, said after 
the event that MSA plays an 
important part in his life.

“While 
we’re 
studying 

abroad, we’re also ambassadors 
of our country in a way, and 
in that sense we’re trying to 
showcase our culture,” he said. 
“I think this event helps to 

make sure that I’m not detached 
from my Malaysian society, and 
I’m not forgetting my culture 
and my roots. It makes U of 
M feel like home, and I have a 
Malaysian family that I can rely 
on.”

LSA senior Yu Jun Soh, who 

also danced in the performance, 
said she thought the show 
has a positive impact on the 
Malaysian students on campus.

“We’re showing Malaysian 

culture, 
and 
showing 
the 

campus what our community 
is about,” Soh said. “I think 
that’s really important because 
we 
do 
have 
a 
significant 

Malaysian community, so this 
is the one time we can really 
share our culture and share our 
background with everyone on 
campus.”

The event also featured a 

mini-banquet 
with 
various 

Malaysian foods, including Mee 
Goreng, a spicy fried noodle 

See MALAYSIA, Page 3

with acts of terrorism and 
not allow ourselves to become 
desensitized to happenings in 
Pakistan or around the world.”

For many in attendance, 

the 
vigil 
also 
offered 
an 

opportunity for students to 
share 
their 
connections 
to 

Lahore.

Hijab said her family are 

natives to Lahore, and that 
some of her fondest memories 
were from the trips that she 
took to see her grandparents 
who are still there.

“Sunday’s tragedy really hit 

close to home for me because 
all of my family is in Lahore,” 
Hijab said. “Going through 
the agony of not knowing 
whether my family was OK or 
not was absolutely terrorizing, 
and to think that so many 
citizens of Pakistan go through 
this on a daily basis is very 
disheartening.

The targeting of religious 

minorities in Pakistan was 
addressed candidly by several 
of the other speakers at the 

vigil. LSA sophomore Babu Zia 
spoke about his experiences as 
a Lahore resident, saying he 
has seen significant changes 
in Pakistan from when he was 
younger to the summer he 
spent in the city as an intern 
last year.

“Ten years ago, when I 

moved to Lahore with my 
family, 
it 
was 
completely 

different,” Zia said. “When I 
returned last year, it was a very 
different place. The democracy 
in Pakistan that we cherish 
gives equal rights to Christians, 
to people of all religions, but 
what these terrorists are doing 
is trying to break the country. 
 

And what we are seeing now in 
Pakistan is that the once united 
country is broken.”

Hijab 
said 
she 
thought 

overall, the vigil played an 
important 
role 
on 
campus 

because it brought people of all 
faiths and ethnicities together 
to talk openly about religious 
pluralism and tolerance.

“It is important that at times 

like this we all come together to 
talk and work to create a more 
positive campus environment 
for all students,” Hijab said.

Former University football 

player Logan Tuley-Tillman 
received a sentence of two years 
probation from the Washtenaw 
County courts on Monday, the 
Detroit Free Press reported. 

In February, Tuley-Tillman 

pleaded guilty to two felonies, and 
in exchange the court dropped 
one count and allowed him to 
be sentenced under the Holmes 
Youthful Trainee Act, which 
allows guilty pleas to be removed 
from an individual’s record 
after the probation period for 
individuals between ages 17 and 
24.

Tuley -Tillman plead guilty to 

one charge of illegally capturing 
or distributing an image of 
an unclothed person and one 
of committing a crime with a 
computer. The second original 
charge of capturing or distributing 
an image of an unclothed person 
was dropped as part of his deal.

On Sept. 7, after discovering 

two short videos of herself, a 
19-year-old woman went to the 
University of Michigan’s Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Awareness 
Center to file a complaint about 
Tuley-Tillman, which resulted in 
the case.

One day after first meeting with 

police detectives on Sept. 9, Tuley-
Tillman was dismissed from the 
University football team where he 
played as an offensive lineman.

DTE plans to create 
10-acre solar panel 
field in Detroit 

DTE Energy has announced 

plans to develop a large field of 
solar energy panels, spanning 
10 acres, in Detroit, the Detroit 
Free Press reported.

The projects aims to help 

stabilize a particular Westside 
neighborhood and to utilize 
public property which currently 
lies vacant.

DTE plans to build the solar 

array on a city-owned site south 
of the I-96 freeway at Greenfield 
Road. The area is currently 
known as O’Shea Playground, 
but was decomissioned by the 
city’s recreation department 
in 2011. Since that time, the 
lot has been stripped and has 
experienced fire damage.

The neighborhood 

surrounding the area has 
suffered population loss and 
effects from neglected homes 
over the past several years. City 
officials partnering with DTE 
on the project said they hope the 
solar array will act as a catalyst 
to improve the neighborhood. 

The city also plans on 

using federal funds for the 
demolition of nearby blighted 
homes and to train residents for 
environmentally friendly jobs 
focused on reusing the area.

The Detroit City Council still 

has to approve the deal before 
any work can begin.

Engineering prof. 
chosen to lead 
ADVANCE 
program

Jennifer Linderman, 

associate dean for graduate 
education in the College of 
Engineering, was named the 
new director of ADVANCE, a 
University program aimed at 
promoting diversity and faculty 
success.

Linderman will take over 

the position starting Sept. 1, 
replacing the founding director 
Abigail Stewart. Stewart will 
return to her role as a faculty 
member.

 In a press release, Linderman 

said she was excited to lead a 
program she had been involved 
in as a faculty member.

 “I am deeply honored to be 

selected to lead this program 
that is so important to the 
recruitment, retention and 
development of faculty leaders,” 
she said.

with terms generally considered 
offensive or ones that groups 
like racial minorities, women 
and transgender people.

Southern has often received 

scrutiny and criticism due to 
her radical opinions on many 
controversial topics, such as a 
Youtube video “Why I am Not a 
Feminist” she uploaded in April 
2015, which has nearly 882,000 
views.

She began her remarks by 

discussing 
her 
experience 

at a march to combat rape 
culture, called a Slut Walk. 
After holding a sign that read, 
“There is no rape culture in 
the West,” she said she was 
harassed, yelled at and had her 
sign taken away, which she said 
was indicative of the way free 
speech is restricted, both in the 
United States and Canada.

“It’s 
just 
so 
unfortunate 

that we actually have to do 
this speech in general, that 
free speech actually has to be 

defended, that it’s something 
that we can’t just take for 
granted,” she said.

Southern also discussed the 

role social media plays with 
regard to free speech, noting 
the countless times she has 
been banned from Twitter for 
her comments about gender and 
sexuality. She recently created 
the hashtag #TheTriggering 
to deliberately post offensive 
comments 
to 
Twitter 
in 

the 
name 
of 
free 
speech, 

accordingto Reason magazine.

“Our 
generation 
has 
a 

complete and total disregard 
for speech rights, and it is 
destroying 
our 
freedoms,” 

Southern said. “Our education 
systems have simply no room 
for diversity of opinion … 
Having ideas is not dangerous, 
being offensive is not harmful, 
and it should never be declared 
illegal, ever.”

LSA 
sophomore 
John 

Pillinger said he attended the 
event to support the importance 
of having free speech.

Pillinger said he encountered 

issues with free speech before 

on campus when he advertised 
a 
lecture 
featuring 
Milo 

Yiannopoulos, a controversial 
British 
journalist, 
at 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
to 

his residence hall. Pillinger 
said other students in his 
hall scrutinized and reacted 
negatively to his support of 
Yiannopoulos.

“We’re here at a liberal 

arts university and our whole 
experience 
is 
about 
being 

exposed to new ideas and not 
having to shut up,” Pillinger 
said.

LSA senior Alfred Cerrone, 

a member of Young Americans 
for Liberty, said he attended 
the 
event 
due 
to 
having 

witnessed aggressions against 
free speech on campus.

“Free speech is the most 

important right that we’re 
guaranteed in this country,” 
Cerrone 
said. 
“It’s 
very 

hypocritical when people label 
things as hateful and they don’t 
get you a chance to explain 
their opinion, especially when 
their 
opinion 
differs 
from 

theirs.”

RateMyProfessor.com.

“Despite what you may think 

of ratemyprofessor.com, every 
time I ask my class if they use it, 
all the hands go up,” Evrard said.

The course evaluation tool 

does not currently use faculty-
specific data, but starting in fall 
2016, instructor-focused data 
is set to be released. The goal, 
Evrard said, is to offer in-house 
data to students who want to 
know more about the classes 
they are signing up for.

“ART 2.0 is a reboot,” Evrard 

said. “It’s a reboot that comes in 
under the direction of the Digital 
Innovation 
Greenhouse 
and 

partly is motivated by the desire 
to go beyond the 20th-century 
experience.”

SACUA 
Chair 
Silke-Maria 

Weineck said she was concerned 
with the tool providing extensive 
course 
evaluation 
material, 

noting earlier faculty concerns.

“We’ve just spent about a year 

hashing out data and creating 
committees to see how to do 
this,” Weineck said.

Kinesiology 
Prof. 
Stefan 

Szymanski said he is worried 
about faculty information being 
made available to other fellow 
faculty members because he fears 
that not every faculty member 
at the University has their 
colleagues’ best interests at heart.

“Among people of goodwill, 

there are never problems really,” 
Szymanski said. “But sadly, we 
are not 100 percent goodwill.”

SACUA 
proposed 
several 

modifications for ART 2.0 to 
Evrard, including making data 
only available to faculty for the 
courses they teach. SACUA also 
suggested that only questions 
recommended by the body for the 
course evaluations be included 
on the tool.

Along with evaluations, the 

committee also discussed the 
new sexual misconduct policy 
for students, announced last 

week and slated to be publically 
released on April 6. Weineck said 
though the new policy featured 
an 
appeals 
committee 
for 

students who want to appeal the 
charge against them, this same 
benefit has not been provided to 
faculty.

Over the past year, SACUA 

has expressed multiple concerns 
about the process by which 
faculty 
are 
investigated 
for 

sexual 
misconduct 
issues, 

releasing a report last year 
that charged the University’s 
procedures lacked due process. 
In the fall, the University said it 
would make several changes to 
the policy for faculty in response 
to the concerns.

“Faculty should be able to 

appeal the report and not just the 
sanctions,” Weineck said.

The addition of an appeals 

committee for faculty violations 
is set to be discussed more 
in-depth at the upcoming Faculty 
Senate meeting — a gathering 
of 
the 
entirety 
of 
faculty 

governance — April 18.

LSA 
sophomore 
Mariam 

Hjaige said she attended the 
show to gain insight on a new 
culture and learn more about 
what 
diversity 
means 
on 

campus.

“There are a lot of culture 

shows that happen on campus, 
and I try to go to as many as I 
can,” she said. “We live on such 
a diverse campus that I feel like 
it would be wrong if I didn’t go 
to these events because I have 
this opportunity to learn about 
these different cultures.”

MSA president Ili Anuar, an 

LSA junior, said she hoped the 
event inspired other students 
to learn more about Malaysian 

heritage and history. 

“We’ve been thinking about 

opening up more — we’ve never 
promoted our organization in 
Festifall or anything, so we 
feel like it’s really important 
to put ourselves out there and 
make it easier for Malaysians 
to find us,” she said. “I think 
the Malaysian Culture Night 
is really important because 
it helps us bond, and it helps 
promote our culture to the 
community.”

Currier 

pointed to an example of the 
positive impact students have 
made on monitoring in countries 
such as Honduras to inspire 
student activism on campus and 
around the country.

In 2008, Currier said, Russell 

Athletic had a factory in Honduras, 
but chose to source elsewhere 
after native workers formed a 
union. She alleged that workers 
found 
themselves 
blacklisted, 

uncompensated and unemployable 
as a result of the move.

USAS mobilized a delegation 

of students in response to the 
changes to help workers protest, 
with the aim of having campus 
groups pressure their universities 
to hold Russell accountable while 
workers organized in Honduras. 
Ultimately, Currier said students 
led to contracts being cut at 110 
universities 
over 
a 
two-year 

period, costing the brand over $50 
million.

“The workers won because 

our campaign was so effective,” 
Currier said. “Student pressure 
is so important, they not only 
reopened the factory and allowed 
workers to have their union, 
but they signed a binding union 
agreement to allow seven other 
factories in Honduras to form 
unions.”

During 
the 
event, 
Supalai 

shared 
her 
own 
personal 

experience with worker abuse 
and unsafe working conditions. 
At the Thai factory Eagle Speed, 
she served as the president of the 
labor union that formed when the 
factory exploited its employees. 
She charged that workers were 
subject to dangerous conditions 
and poor hours from 8 a.m. to 
midnight after Nike threatened to 
pull its business from Eagle Speed 
if they failed to meet a stricter 
deadline at a lesser cost.

As 
well, 
she 
said 
when 

employees were unable to fulfill 
these expectations, Nike failed 
to pay the factory and, in turn, 
workers did not receive wages for 
more than two months. Any sign 
of protest was met with threats of 
termination.

Supalai noted that in her case, 

several Thai organizations and 
the government all failed to 
intervene on their behalf, and it 
wasn’t until an external inspector 
got involved that they began to 
see results. Ultimately, 23 strikers 
who were detained were released 
and the factory apologized to 
the employees, providing them 
with a choice to resign with 
compensation or to continue 
working with Eagle Speed.

Supalai emphasized the need 

for 
independent 
monitoring 

organizations, saying she was 
concerned about Nike’s current 
policy that allows the company 
to monitor its own operations.

“I would like to call for you 

to put effort in this campaign to 
call for the possibility of WRC 
to be able to monitor Nike,” 
Supalai said. “There’s a need 
for a middle organization like 
WRC to monitor Nike because 
Nike doesn’t care about working 
conditions. 
In 
my 
opinion, 

they’re 
forming 
their 
own 

organization to do this job just 
because they want to hide behind 
this organization.”

Currier 
pointed 
to 
action 

taken at other universities, such 
as the University of Washington 
and 
Cornell 
University, 
that 

have begun to demand various 
factories 
allow 
independent 

inspections of work conditions.

“The goal is that more students 

know about this problem with 
Nike and take action to force 
the University to force Nike to 
be accountable to independent 
monitors,” Currier said. “And if 
Nike doesn’t reverse this policy, 
they shouldn’t be able to make 
Michigan apparel in the fall.”

profession you enter into,” she 
said. “It’s a global effort to be able 
to take whatever skill you have 
and be a part of the movement. It 
doesn’t have to be rallying in the 
streets.”

Her remarks largely centered 

on her experiences with the 
prominent national cases she’d 
been involved in — the deaths of 
Martin, Rice and Brown.

In 
February 
2012, 
video 

footage 
showed 
George 

Zimmerman shooting 17-year-old 
African-American high school 
student, Trayvon Martin, while 
he was walking, unarmed, in his 
neighborhood in Florida. Martin 
died as a result of the wound. At 
the time, Zimmerman claimed 
that he shot Trayvon out of self-
defense, despite being instructed 
by a 911 operator he called about 
Martin to not engage.

Rand said she learned about 

the case before it garnered 
national attention and informed 
her students at the University 
of Miami, which ultimately led 
to the start of the now national 
movement, 
“I 
am 
Trayvon 

Martin.”

“My students went home after 

class that night, and the next 
morning my students sent me 
a video they had shot of them 
saying, ‘I am Trayvon Martin,’ 
and teaching the public of what 
happened to Trayvon Martin 
through the lens of themselves,” 
Rand said. “I got goosebumps. I 
realized the lesson my students 
learned was they understood that 
the most powerful thing you can 
do in any movement is to make 
them see themselves as part of the 
greater whole.”

Rand said the video soon went 

viral, and eventually the local “I 
am Trayvon Martin” movement 
became a national movement and 
then an international one.

“I invited them to meet with 

the prosecutors and we created 
posters,” Rand said. “Each of my 
students addressed the press, 
which was the launch of what 
became the national movement. 
It was amazing because within a 
week, President Obama said ‘I am 
Trayvon Martin.’ ”

Almost 
two 
months 
after 

the shooting, Zimmerman was 
charged with the second-degree 
murder 
of 
Trayvon 
Martin. 

Rand 
counseled 
the 
Martin 

family during criminal court 
proceedings, which resulted in a 
not guilty verdict for Zimmerman.

Rand said the news of the not 

guilty verdict was a devastation.

“That night, I kept waiting 

for the next announcement,” she 
said. “I was so exhausted that 
I couldn’t turn the TV off. I fell 
asleep with the news on and all 
I heard all night long was, ‘not 
guilty, not guilty, not guilty.’ I 
remember thinking I did not 
want to get out of my bed. I did 
not want that to be the reality of 
my nation.”

However, she said she was 

inspired to continue her work 
after receiving a phone call from 
Martin’s mother, who reminded 
her of her duty to serve as a 
civic leader to fight for equality. 
Though 
Zimmerman 
wasn’t 

sentenced, Rand said she thought 
the case will have a lasting impact 
on the nation.

“Even 
though 
there 
was 

not a guilty verdict, we gained 
the momentum of the people,” 
Rand said. “It opened national 
discussions on race relations, gun 
control and stand your ground 
laws. It pulled the United Nations 
in to look at our criminal system.”

BBUS member Lauren Ward, 

a Business freshman, said she 
thought Rand is a positive role 
model with a valuable perspective 
to offer students at the University.

“BBUS collaborated with the 

Office of Greek Life this week 
because the speaker of this 
week, Jasmine Rand,” Ward 
said. “She is a good example of 
someone to look at, as a woman 
in business and in a role of 
such power, who can influence 
students into thinking that they 
can take on such high profile 
cases and influence headlines.”

LSA senior Caira Cronin said 

Rand’s speech was beneficial 
to the audience and spread a 
positive message that the Greek 
community should reflect on 
during diversity and inclusion 
week.

“I 
think 
it’s 
extremely 

important to bring this to our 
campus because we have had 
negative media about Greek life 
and privilege,” Cronin said. “It’s 
important to bring speakers 
to campus that are exposing 
issues that impact everyone.”

As an attorney, professor 

and activist, Rand said she 
continues to take on large 
numbers of cases to fight for 
the protection of the rights of 
young African-American men, 
saying she was positive her 
efforts would ultimately make 
a difference.

“I am in a revolutionary state 

of mind — politically correct is 
for politicians,” Rand said. “I 
bit my tongue with Trayvon. 
I bit my tongue with Michael 
Brown. Change will come.”

I 

am not a fan of socially awkward 
situations. I turn away from people 
breaking 
up 
in 
public 
to 
avoid 

any 
semblance 
of 

confrontation. 
Telling 

a student government 
candidate I don’t want to 
vote for them on the Diag 
makes my skin crawl. 
Waving 
at 
somebody 

that I had class with 
freshman year only to 
have them not remember 
me 
is 
my 
real-life 

manifestation of hell.

One of the first things 

I learned when I arrived 
at the University of Michigan was that 
headphones block out most of these socially 
awkward situations. Headphones, as a social 
signaling device, tell passing individuals that 
I don’t want to talk to them (and couldn’t hear 
them if they tried to ignore this sign). So far, 
the efficacy of this method is pretty solid; 
it is rare for somebody to come up to me in 
public while I’m blaring Justin Bieber’s new 
single through my massive SOL Republic 
headphones. Headphone use in public, it 
seems, is one of the most impactful habits I 
have developed in my time at the University.

Back in high school, when I didn’t have the 

freedom to use my phone or other devices 
in school, I used to talk to pretty much 
anybody I walked past. I prided myself on 
knowing almost all of my peers by name, 
though my school’s relatively miniscule 
population helped. This trend seemed to be 
indicative of the social situation put forth by 
the school environment: Nobody had phones 
or headphones, so our social interaction was 
more public and interconnected.

As a result of my social fluidity, my distaste 

for socially awkward situations seemed to 
mellow. Like how lifting weights makes a 
person stronger, engaging with people made 
me less socially apprehensive. Over time, I 
developed a social strength that made me 
feel confident, happy and, most importantly, 
engaged with the world around me. This 
derivation of the social learning theory 
allowed me to grow with my everyday social 
interactions.

Though the social dynamics of a huge 

public institution like the University — and, 
consequently, a bustling Midwestern city 
like Ann Arbor — are notably different than 
those of my rural high school, translating 
my high school sociability doesn’t seem 
impossible to me.

Over the past few months, I have made 

a concerted effort to not wear headphones 
while walking to class all the time. Though 
I don’t talk to every person I pass, I feel that 
my social anxiety has lessened with each 
passing awkward-esque interaction. Talking 
to solicitors while waiting for a crosswalk to 
open doesn’t make me want to sprint in the 

opposite direction. I can make eye contact 
with a fellow human being without wanting 
to curl up in a ball and hide me forever. In 
essence, I am regaining the strength I once 
had in high school.

There are still days when I wear 

headphones in public. Sometimes I just need 
to get hyped up for an exam (that I know, 
deep down, I’m doomed to fail). Other times, 
it is nice to just have a soundtrack for a 
beautiful Michigan spring afternoon. Finally, 
there are just some days when I don’t want to 
talk to anybody while walking to my 8 a.m. 
discussion section. There is nothing wrong 
with these desires and my intent is not to 
demonize headphones, cell phones or any 
individual that displays social myopia.

However, 
these 
instances 
cannot 

overtake our lives. With the advent of new 
technologies like the Internet, smartphones 
and other devices, some have envisioned 
future societies that simply do not interact 
with one another in public. The 2013 movie 
“Her” featured a man falling in love with the 
computer that lived in his wireless earbud. 
“WALL-E,” the futuristic animated movie, 
showed the world as a mass of screen-
connected amorphous blobs that didn’t look 
at one another, let alone talk to one another. 
These are worse-case scenarios facilitated by 
new technologies.

With the mass introduction of “Her”-esque 

Bragi Dash earbuds that rest wirelessly in our 
ear canals (with similar moves by companies like 
Apple), it is easy to get cynical. However, these 
new technologies do nothing to force people into 
sound bubbles. Nothing about new headphones, 
or even our existing corded earbuds, force us into 
avoiding social interaction.

It is human nature to avoid things that 

make us uncomfortable. New technologies 
do facilitate our ability to focus on things that 
make us feel comfortable. But, as any college 
professor can tell you, comfortable isn’t 
always the best state of being, nor one that will 
be infinitely achievable.

We will not be able to ignore breakups in 

public when we are involved, so maybe we 
should learn how to deal with them when 
we’re not involved. It’s inevitable that we will 
have to greet somebody that maybe doesn’t 
remember our names, so maybe we should 
practice the awkward task sooner rather than 
later. By practicing with the trials of everyday 
public social interaction, we can better 
prepare ourselves for the instances in which 
we care to interact, as even these voluntary 
situations can be awkward.

It is human nature for awkward situations 

to arise. But maybe instead of running away 
from these situations or enclosing ourselves in 
our headphones, we should just be awkward 
sometimes. We just might learn how to be less 
awkward in the future.

— The New York Times Editorial Board, on the Flint water crisis.

“

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

Congress, which has refused to invest 

sufficiently in the nation’s public 
works and has been antagonistic to 
environmental protection, must also 

learn from the crisis.

W

hen I look back on my past 
three years of college, 
I have a lot of mixed 

feelings. I grew up in Ann Arbor 
and was inevitably a Birkenstock-
wearing tomboy who wasn’t too 
excited about life in college because 
this was already my home. The Big 
House was just “the stadium,” and I 
hated the drunken college students 
who would yell at us when we would 
drive by like they owned the town, 
when it was actually mine.

I bought my first pair of heels 

about two weeks into college because 
I was told that I should have a pair 
of wedges for sorority recruitment. 
I looked like a chicken walking 
uncomfortably in thick tan heels 
from house to house and had no 
desire to pretend I was anything but 
an Ann Arbor girl who really just 
wanted to find a new place within my 
home. I went to mixers, date parties 
and late nights and had a blast. I had 
a really fun time doing fun things, 
mindless things.

I had a really fun time until I 

realized I had no idea who I had 
become or what I wanted. I was in 
a place, unaware of how I’d gotten 
there, and at a loss as to how to move 
forward. I thought I was the only 
one in this school who was scared 
shitless about the future. However, 
I soon realized that I was actually 
in the majority of students on this 
campus who have no idea what they 
really want and are just finding their 
way one step at a time.

I relied on people more than I 

wanted to, but soon learned that it 
was OK and normal to do so. I hated 
the fact that I wasn’t perfect and 
couldn’t control everything. No one 
told me that college isn’t all just one 
big party, late-night study session, 
exam or paper; it’s just four years of 
your life. I had this idea that I needed 
to be a certain person, make regular 
appearances at Skeeps or Rick’s and 
prioritize my wardrobe, and it took 
me three years to finally ignore those 
and just do what I wanted. It took me 

three years to prioritize myself.

I tried to talk myself out of my 

major for two years. People told me 
that English was just a lot of reading 
and talking. Well, it is. It’s a lot of 
reading and even more writing. But 
it’s also a lot of work. I’ve gotten 
to write about the perspective of 
flowers, the female perspective of 
dominant male figures in Greek 
mythology, the relationship between 
magical realism and surrealism and 
the character development in Charles 
Dickens novels. I really couldn’t be 
happier. I’ll graduate with a double 
major in English and political science 
on April 30.

This school is huge. I’ve had my 

fair share of challenges navigating 
it even though I grew up here. I’ve 
had to sacrifice friendships, make 
hard decisions and push through 
some really challenging times. But 
the thing that no one tells you is 
that so does everyone. I’ve realized 
that more people on this campus 
fight battles every day than anyone 
ever tells you. Yes, we can all go to 
Skeeps and Rick’s and pretend like 
we’re fine even if we aren’t. We can 
hug and complement each other’s 
lipstick color or necklace, vineyard 
vines shirt or Bean boots. Or we can 
start having real conversations about 
the hard things. I’ve done both, and 
I’ll probably continue to do both. 
I’ve just realized that I care a lot 
more about the hard stuff, because 
it’s usually the most important and 
eventually can lead to some of the 

best stuff. I’ve had more tear-filled 
conversations, 
stomach-churning 

anxiety and tense walks than some 
people on this campus, but I’m fine 
with that.

If I could go back in time, I’d 

have a lot to tell myself. To my 
freshman self, relax. It’s OK to 
care. To my sophomore self, it’s OK 
to have hard times. You can’t fix 
everyone else’s problems, but you 
can take care of yourself, in fact 
you should. Junior me, take a deep 
breath. You’re human. And now, I 
hope those of you who have some 
time left at this school will take 
the time to grow as an individual. 
Learn what you like, what you 
value, what you want, what you 
have, and enjoy it. Be kind to 
yourself and trust that you’re not 
the only one who has felt what 
you feel. Voice your opinions and 
concerns, your insecurities, your 
fears, your values, and learn. 
Learn a lot. Be respectful and 
appreciative. College has been 
a humbling experience in many 
ways, hardly easy, never boring, 
always 
weird 
— 
and 
getting 

weirder. I’ve made a family and a 
new home within my home of Ann 
Arbor. I’ve made best friends, a 
lot of mistakes and memories that 
will last me forever.

Ann Arbor will always be my 

home. I will probably always honk 
at drunk students on Saturday 
mornings, get frustrated when 
they walk in front of my car for five 
minutes without looking up from 
their cellphones and shake my head 
when I see sorority girls chanting 
out of windows. But I get it now. I’ve 
found a new appreciation for my 
home and feel so lucky to have been 
able to spend four years with some 
of the most amazing professors, 
GSIs, peers and administrators 
in the country. In April, I’ll be 
graduating college. I’m terrified, 
but at least I can admit it.

Be awkward

S

hining vividly against the 
darkening night sky and 
bathed 

in 
the 
colors 

of 
the 
Belgian 

flag, 
the 
Eiffel 

Tower stood tall 
Tuesday night as 
a remarkable symbol of European 
brotherhood — resiliency in the face 
of terror and shared democratic 
values. Yet, the support for Belgium 
after this week’s horrific terrorist 
attacks in the very heart of Western 
Europe did not stop there. Scrolling 
through various social media feeds 
and websites, I was overwhelmed 
by the statements and beautiful 
drawings of “Je Suis Bruxelles” by 
people of all nationalities, echoing 
the cries of “Je Suis Charlie” that 
became viral after the attacks in 
Paris this past November.

If one thing is for sure, our world 

certainly knows how to come 
together in times of tragedy, and 
I will proudly retweet any image 
supporting the survivors of the 
bombings in Brussels or change 
my Facebook profile picture to 
match the colors of the French 
flag. However, when six gunmen, 
members 
of 
Al-Qaeda’s 
North 

African branch, opened fire at 
an Ivory Coast beach resort on 
March 14 and left 16 dead bloodied 
bodies on the beach, where were 
our proclamations of “Je Suis Côte 
d’Ivoire?”

Though Brussels certainly saw 

the most violent acts of terrorism 
since the attacks in Paris, there 
have still been dozens of terrorist 
attacks, most widely unreported, 
since Nov. 13. In just the past month, 
bombings in Ankara and Istanbul 
have killed more than 40 people and 
left another 162 injured. Many of the 
injured were foreign tourists and 
civilians — the same type of victims 
in the various terrorist attacks on 
African countries in the past year.

In relation to countries such as 

the Ivory Coast and Turkey, media 
coverage can portray the United 
States as existing in an entirely 
different world. Yet, when Paris, the 
very bastion of liberty and equality, 
was attacked, it terrified us so much 
because it showed how easily such a 
tragedy could have happened here in 
our own country. We are reminded 
of Boston on April 15, 2013; we are 

reminded of New York on Sept. 11, 
2001. We see pieces of ourselves 
in the frightened faces of Belgians 
fleeing through darkened subway 
tunnels and hear our own voices 
in the cries of a little French child 
crying outside the bombed soccer 
stadium. The world is a rapidly 
changing place, full of horrible 
people and events that we can only 
hope will never be repeated again, 
and we are scared. Thus, whenever 
one of our fellow democratic nations 
is attacked by forces that seem so 
different from us, we speak out to 
everyone that will listen, often in 
the form of social media, to assure 
both ourselves and our country that 
freedom, democracy and love will 
ultimately overcome all.

However, this method of thinking 

also contributes to the dangerous 
divide that still exists between 
wealthy Western countries and the 
rest of the world, or, in the example 
of what happened in the Ivory 
Coast, Muslim and non-Muslim 
countries. We must work to expand 
the media coverage of the tragedies 
that occur across all continents, 
as they are committed by the 
same kinds of terrorist groups 
that the United States is working 
toward exterminating. Rather than 
presenting all acts of terrorism, 
all horrible tragedies, on equal 
footing, the media sensationalizes 
any terrorist attack committed 
against a Western nation by a 
Muslim group because it fits into 
the narrative it wants to use to gain 
viewers and garner an extreme 
emotional response.

The 
same 
week 
Paris 
was 

attacked, stories about Boko Haram 
militants marching into the village 
of 
Baga, 
Nigeria, 
slaughtering 

more than 2,000 civilians and 
seizing control of the nation-

state 
resurfaced 
because 
they 

hadn’t gotten the same amount of 
attention previously. Here in the 
United States, Africa is portrayed as 
a land where these types of killings 
are common, yet that aspect alone 
should amass even more scrutiny 
from the Western world. In terms 
of mass murder, how can one life 
be deemed more important than 
another?

In order to strengthen our 

understanding of groups such as 
Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram and ISIS, 
we must realize that the Western-
dominated media only present a 
miniscule number of the atrocities 
they commit. Yet, the human heart 
has no limit on the amount of love 
it can express. We don’t have to 
choose which tragedies to mourn, 
we can show solidarity with people 
of all countries. Because when there 
is a terrorist group slaughtering 
innocent 
civilians, 
choosing 

to 
uphold 
our 
stereotypical 

distinctions 
between 
Western 

countries and the rest of the world is 
harmful to both our duties as human 
beings and our national security.

We must not only show support 

for countries far away, but to our 
fellow citizens inside U.S. borders as 
well. The manner in which Western 
media 
covers 
terrorism 
only 

augments ignorance. Today, only 27 
percent of Americans have a positive 
view of Muslim Americans, which 
is absolutely terrifying — seeing as 
Muslim Americans have absolutely 
nothing to do with the attacks 
committed by radical groups such as 
ISIS. Ignorance such as this leads to 
hatred and violence, which, judging 
by the state of the world right now, 
we don’t need any more of.

I wholeheartedly support “Je Suis 

Bruxelles” and “Je Suis Charlie,” 
but I also call for the inclusion of 
support for terrorism-torn countries 
that are cut off from the rest of the 
world due to lack of resources and 
corrupt governments. By educating 
ourselves on the horrible acts being 
committed 
beyond 
our 
bubble 

of Western capitalism, we can 
better aid and raise awareness for 
nations that are under risk of being 
completely taken over by dangerous 
radical groups.

Zayn’s solo start puts 
the lust in lackluster

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Allow me to introduce you to 

the new and improved Justin 
Timberlake.

A year after 

escaping One 
Direction, 
Zayn Malik — 
the most tal-
ented member 
of the British 
boy band, for-
mer 
12-year-

old 
girls’ 

obsession and 
Gigi 
Hadid’s 

best accessory — just put out his 
first solo album.

Sick of the tight pop param-

eters placed on One Direction, 
Zayn quit the band real quick 
in pursuit of creative freedom, 
and that’s exactly what Mind of 
Mine is. It’s Zayn being Zayn. 
What does that mean? It means 
the virginal boy band image is 
tarnished with 18 songs packed 
with references to sex, alcohol 
and sex. It means basic pop bal-
lads are ripped apart and shred-
ded with R&B flare. It means 
One Direction homogeneity is 
replaced with a diverse set of 
club bangers, seductive R&B 
soothers and stripped down bal-
lads. 

Let’s start with the club 

bangers. These are the Justin 
Bieber “What Do You Mean?” 

frat party hits: “Tio,” “Pil-
lowtalk” and “Like I Would” are 
rated R One Direction hits with 
sexy lyrics and techno beats. 
They won’t matter in five years, 
but for now, look forward to 
hearing them at the bars.

Where things get interest-

ing are with the seductive R&B 
soothers: “Wrong,” “Truth” and 
“Rear View” are pretty solid 
but “Befour” is the essence of 
Zayn. Slow, steady beats are lay-
ered with subtle instrumentals 
to let ears catch every marvel-
ous note Zayn hits, because at 
2:15 he belts that falsetto like no 
other contemporary artist can. 
His voice just keeps soaring and 
seducing and working. Yes, the 
lyrics may be basic, but with a 
voice like that, dull diction can 
be overlooked.

But just when you thought you 

were listening to a former boy-
bander, the intermission hits and 
it hits hard. “Flower,” lasting for 
just a minute and 44 seconds, 
is a minute and 44 seconds of 
artistic genius. As legend has it, 

Zayn completely improvised this 
Pakistani ghazal interlude. Sung 
in Urdu, “Flower” is probably 
the most notable track on Mind 
of Mine. It effectively turns just 
another R&B/pop album into 
something more. Nodding to 
his Pakistani Muslim heritage, 
this folky “let me practice some 
yoga poses” interlude is not only 
meaningful to Zayn, but lovely 
for the rest of us to listen to. 

However, between “Befour” 

and this stand-out intermission, 
it’s hard to really appreciate the 
rest of the album. Zayn attempts 
to pull at our heartstrings with 
stripped down ballads like “It’s 
You,” “Fool For You” and “Blue,” 
but from the lack of powerful 
instrumentals to the absence of 
his entrancing vocals, they all 
fall short of anything but aver-
age. 

Though at first listen Mind of 

Mine positions Zayn as the next 
Justin Timberlake, there’s no 
doubt that something is lurk-
ing behind his music that would 
say he’s something — someone 
— more. Once you get past some 
of the essential club hits he had 
to produce to stay relevant, 
“Truth” and “Flower” prove that 
Zayn has more to offer than just 
a few club hits and R&B jams. 
Whatever Zayn does next will be 
interesting, but for now respect 
the existence of “Flower” and 
add those R&B tracks to your sex 
playlist. 

FILM REVIEW
‘Dawn of’ a letdown

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

Daily Arts Writer

There’s 
a 
new 
mentality 

toward superheroes in Gotham 
City. Residents no longer wel-
come them into 
the 
city, 
but 

banish them to 
its outskirts — 
they’ve become 
completely fed 
up with these 
cape-wearing 
creatures, and 
by 
the 
end 

of 
“Batman 

v 
Superman: 

Dawn of Jus-
tice,” we are, 
too. 

Basically, there’s a lot of ten-

sion 
between 
Batman 
(Ben 

Affleck, “Argo”) and Superman 
(Henry Cavill, “Man of Steel”), 
and the public hates both of them, 
thanks to Lex Luthor’s (Jesse 
Eisenberg, 
“American 
Ultra”) 

manipulative 
tactics. 
Luthor 

wants both of them dead, so their 
feud allows him to get what he 
wants with minimal effort on his 
part (although he does go to great 
lengths to create a backup plan). 
On the sidelines is Lois Lane 
(Amy Adams, “Man of Steel”), 
who desperately tries to repair 
Superman’s broken image. Sadly, 
no one vouches for Batman’s 
greatness, making him look like a 
ruthless killer lacking any morals 
whatsoever. Even more depress-
ing is the romance between Lois 
and Clark; its destructive power 
can only be matched by kryp-
tonite.

Producing one coherent plot 

proves to be a difficult task for 
screenwriters 
Chris 
Terrio 

(“Argo”) and David S. Goyer (“The 
Dark Knight”). Even if you’re not 
a DC Comics fanatic, you’ll most 
likely predict 90 percent of the 
film’s events at least 10 minutes 
before they happen because of 
the 
excessive 
foreshadowing. 

And while we’re given far too 
many hints about what’s going to 
happen next, we don’t get enough 
backstory. Then there’s the issue 
of new characters suddenly being 
introduced, only to be killed off a 
few scenes later.

Nothing is inherently wrong 

with big-budget superhero mov-
ies produced by production com-
panies like Warner Bros., and 
many are remarkable. But when 
the companies churn out a movie 
with the sole purpose of creating 
hype for the sequel, the movie at 
hand inevitably suffers a tragic 
fate. “Batman v Superman: Dawn 
of Justice” suffers from this 
unfortunate mistake; annoyingly 
obvious promotional inserts fur-
ther deteriorate the already loose 
narrative storyline.

Performance-wise, the por-

trayal of Batman wins, hands 
down. Affleck delivers his lines 
with just enough emotion to 
nicely humanize Bruce Wayne’s 
character without seeming melo-
dramatic. But the feats of a hero 
are only impressive if he defeats a 
formidable adversary. Luckily for 
Affleck, Eisenberg perfectly por-
trays the infamous Lex Luthor. 
The ever-present but only slightly 
detectable quiver in Eisenberg’s 
voice emphasizes Luthor’s inse-
curities, which fuel his mali-
cious desires. His freakishly high 
intelligence alone, demonstrated 
by his well-written, almost pro-
phetic lines, is enough to make 
both opponents and audience 
members feel like hiding. But this 
is Jesse Eisenberg we’re talking 
about — he already brings a fan-
tastically versatile awkwardness 
to every character he portrays, 
which can make us see him as 
anything from insanely adorable 
to totally evil. He also provides us 
with the only moments of comic 
relief that are actually humorous.

As for their female counter-

parts, Adams’s talent is taken for 
granted, as she is quickly reduced 
from a keen, independent woman 
to a damsel in distress. On the 
other hand, Gal Gadot (“Furious 
7”), who plays Wonder Woman, 
is only allowed to demonstrate 
her badass combat skills for a few 
scenes, most of which are spoiled 
in the trailer anyway.

It’s pretty obvious from the 

opening sequence how this film 
cost nearly $250 million — the cin-
ematography is astounding. The 
shots of young Bruce Wayne fall-
ing down a hole, running through 
what seems to be a graveyard and 

experiencing the death of his par-
ents are extremely aesthetically 
pleasing. There’s a beautiful color 
contrast between the vibrant blue 
sky above Bruce as he falls and 
the darkness surrounding him as 
he runs through the graveyard. 
Another remarkable scene is the 
car chase that happens after Bat-
man/Bruce Wayne realizes the 
true identity of the White Por-
tuguese. Somehow his armored 
car, which looks like a Batmobile 
designed in the year 2020, can 
withstand explosives, machine 
gun bullets and everything else 
Lex Luthor’s henchmen throw at 
it. Cinematographer Larry Fong’s 
special effects are a perfect visu-
al spectacle here: they’re quite 
unbelievable, but not entirely 
unrealistic. 
The 
captivating 

powers of this scene are further 
enhanced by the constantly shift-
ing camera angles from which the 
viewers witness the event.

Unfortunately, the rest of the 

film is riddled with cheesiness. 
This isn’t your barely tolerable 
level of corniness either — it’s 
an exasperated sigh, a facepalm-
inducing level of awfulness. Slow 
motion is used far too often, 
turning what should be glori-
ous moments into comedic ones. 
Another unfortunate trope is the 
superhero stare — the close-up 
shots that emphasize his gaze, 
then, ideally, quickly cut to what 
he was looking at. In the film, 
these shots are held far too long, 
making us feel incredibly uncom-
fortable as we watch.

Essentially, “Batman v Super-

man: Dawn of Justice” suffers 
from an identity crisis. It falters 
trying to assert its belonging in 
the superhero genre by over-
emphasizing numerous clichés. 
Furthermore, 
the 
amped-up 

romantic subplot between Lois 
and Clark attempts to inject 
romantic drama into a superhero 
adaptation, but it only results 
in dryness. Luckily, Eisenberg 
and Affleck’s performances are 
superb enough to provide us with 
a sense of stability. Despite the 
chaos that the script generates, 
they understand that the essence 
of this story is the same as every 
other superhero flick: the battle 
between good and evil.

TV REVIEW
‘Heartbeat’ doesn’t 
have any sign of life

By MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

“Heartbeat” is the melting pot 

of the medical daytime drama. 
It’s like the network dropped 
Dr. 
Mahoney 

(Eliza 
Coupe, 

“Quantico”) 
from the last 
season 
of 

“Scrubs” onto 
the set of “Red 
Band 
Soci-

ety” with the 
cast of “Grey’s 
Anatomy.” 
But 
instead 

of 
the 
super 

cool 
mash-up 

it sounds like, “Heartbeat” falls 
short of expectations, becoming 
a Viagra infomercial that never 
ends.

Actress Melissa George (“The 

Good Wife”) leads this soap as Dr. 
Alex Panttiere, a brilliant and out-
spoken heart transplant surgeon 
whose role is loosely inspired by 
the work of Dr. Kathy Magliato, 
one of the few female cardio-
thoracic surgeons in the world. 
However, “loosely” is an under-
statement. Even though the show 
reports to be completely based off 
of Dr. Magliato’s personal expe-
riences, the delivery is artificial. 
Where Dr. Magliato is a profes-
sional and leader in her career, 
Dr. Alex displays overly reckless 
actions and insulting behavior 
towards both her colleagues and 
patients. She blatantly disregards 
a midair medical crisis to finish 

preparing a speech and knocks 
impatiently on the glass window 
during an important legal meet-
ing. Although Dr. Gregory House 
(Hugh Laurie, “Tomorrowland”) 
also displayed these uncomfort-
able qualities, at least House took 
the time to learn the names of 
his colleagues and interns. Alex 
knows them by nicknames like 
“spray tan” and “glasses.”

The dynamic of “Heartbeat” is 

uncomfortable, at best. Although 
her family is broken and her job 
runs her life, the writers managed 
to jam in a love triangle between 
Panttiere, Australian McDreamy 
doppelganger (Don Hany, “Off-
spring”) and her internal sur-
geon boyfriend (Dave Annable, 
“Brothers & Sisters”). The only 
real romantic relationship in her 
life is with her ex-husband and 
famous rocker, Max Elliot (Josh-
ua Leonard, “If I Stay”) who is, 
unfortunately for her, gay. But 
he’s a good father to their chil-
dren, who show up about one 
time per episode to remind us 
of their existence. At work, the 
nurses throw racist comments 
at one another and doctors tease 
with sex jokes that are more 
uncomfortable than funny. The 
only slightly funny joke is when 
the interns seem to pop out of 
thin air, crowding the M.D.’s with 
notepads a few inches in front of 
their faces. Otherwise, this is not 
a hospital where you would want 
to be a patient.

However, 
jokes 
aside, 
the 

human aspect of “Heartbeat” is 
compelling, pulling at our heart-

strings with the intense situa-
tions Dr. Alex’s patients seem to 
find themselves in on daily basis. 
In the second episode, a pair of 
conjoined twins face the emo-
tionally taxing decision of perma-
nent separation when one sister is 
diagnosed with cancer and can-
not 
undergo 
chemotherapy 

without harming her twin. After 
a 24-hour operation that show-
cases Alex’s command over both 
the operating room and her male 
colleagues, the sisters wake up to 
fully see each other for the first 
time as the staff huddles anx-
iously in the cramped room. It’s a 
touching moment that showcases 
the best of medicine and the pay-
off that comes with the high-risk, 
high-reward lifestyle of the hos-
pital’s staff. Then it’s back to the 
drama for Dr. Alex, who stares 
into Aussie McDreamy’s eyes as 
her boyfriend looks on jealously 
during an operation. I’m not a 
doctor, but even I know that she 
should probably focus on the 
open chest in front of her over 
those gorgeous eyes.

“Heartbeat” seems to be NBC’s 

delayed response to ABC’s “Grey’s 
Anatomy.” They try and try to 
showcase the role of women in a 
man’s profession, but ultimately 
end up showcasing an uncaring, 
troublemaker doctor who cares 
more about getting blood on her 
outfit than helping a dying patient. 
Unfortunately, “Grey’s Anatomy” 
might just be better than this glo-
rified soap opera, which, unlike 
its namesake, doesn’t seem to 
have a pulse.

A 

few months ago, in my 
other life as the film beat 
editor for The Michigan 

Daily, I was looking over a Daily 
Arts application. After giving the 
application a once-over and more 
thoroughly 
reading the 
writing sam-
ples, I put an 
enthusiastic 
YES in the 
voting Google 
Doc. Almost 
instanta-
neously, I got 
a text from a 
fellow editor, 
reading “did 
you see what 
[they] said about your lit column 
tho.” I went back to the applica-
tion and, sure enough, I saw the 
phrase: “the literary columns 
are often pretentious and seem 
uninviting to those who are not 
extremely well versed in litera-
ture.”

I’d like to take this opportu-

nity to say that this person is 
now on my beat and is a great 
writer and contributor to the 
Daily. When I bring this incident 
up, I’m not trying to call anyone 
out — but this comment made 
me consider the way I write, in 
terms of readability.

Readability, the ease with 

which a reader can understand 
a given text, hasn’t always been 
at the forefront of my mind in 
my writing. Before college, when 
beginning to consider myself a 
“writer,” I would meticulously 
look through the thesaurus, try-
ing to improve my vocabulary 
and find big words to annoyingly 
throw into casual conversation. 
Even last year, I had a list of 

pretentious words next to my 
bed that I would put into my 
film reviews (at which my editor 
would raise his eyebrows).

But after reading that fairly 

innocuous comment in the Arts 
application, I began to consider 
language as a barrier. In Langs-
ton Hughes’s anthology of Afri-
can short stories, “An African 
Treasury,” he explicitly says 
he chose “those pieces which I 
enjoyed most and which I hope 
others will find entertaining, 
moving, possibly instructive, but 
above all readable. For me, cre-
ative writing’s first function is 
readability.”

When I first read this passage 

in the introduction to Hughes’s 
anthology, I was in total agree-
ment. It seems reasonable that 
authors in general would want 
as large a potential audience 
as possible, but especially for 
Hughes, who witnessed incred-
ible inequality throughout his 
life. After seeing the effects of 
segregation, Hughes wanted 
to break down the barriers 
between people, including those 
in literature. Still, with the enor-
mous disparities in wealth and 
education in this country, these 
obstacles to learning and reading 
exist even today.

But when looking at both past 

and present literary celebri-
ties, there’s no question that 
not all authors share Hughes’s 
approach. Some authors want to 
make you work hard to under-
stand their work, and since the 
start of literature there have 
been people like this. They’re 
often the same authors who want 
to exclude minorities and women 
from literature, using both their 
status and their words to keep 

others from the literary world. 
And yet there’s a sort of pride in 
getting through an unwelcoming 
text, one that the author clearly 
wants to make difficult for you.

By engaging with texts spe-

cifically designed for an elite 
reader, are we constructing the 
very economies that create this 
exclusivity? In reading authors 
like Jonathan Franzen and Lau-
rence Stern, are we playing right 
into their literary gatekeeping? 
Should we never read again? 
Probably not. As both readers 
and writers, it’s important to be 
conscious of who the audience 
is meant to be — and what struc-
tures we’re reinforcing with that 
work. But even if that work is 
emphasizing a point that we dis-
agree with, it’s still substantive 
to look at critically.

When we were discussing 

balancing these concepts in one 
of my classes, a peer aptly stated, 
“Some of the most important 
work in the world makes you 
feel like an inadequate slug.” I’ll 
admit, literature has made me 
feel slug-like on many occasions: 
when people hate my work, 
when someone uses a word I 
don’t know and even when I 
struggle through some of the 
reading in my harder literature 
classes that combines difficult 
vocabulary with convoluted 
concepts. In both reading and 
writing, there’s a necessity to be 
cognizant of what words can do. 
While it can feel easier to hide 
behind big words, the benefits 
of literature come from its big 
ideas.

ALBUM REVIEW
Thugga saunters 
along on ‘Slime 3’

Young Thug stays 
consistent but loses 

his novelty

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

With the rapid musical output 

of Young Thug comes the inevi-
table fall of his novelty. And it’s 
about time, for 
it’s seemed like 
an eternity of 
responses 
to 

Thug 
being 

almost 
unani-

mously 
self-

righteous 
and 

intensely 
vis-

ceral, negative 
or 
positive. 

Modern Atlanta 
rap as a general 
movement calls for these imme-
diate reactions more than any-
where, thanks to its consistently 
weird and conventional-bashing 
artists. Still, Thugger remains an 
anomaly with his melodic high-
pitched squeaks and screams. 
Now removed from his remarkably 
publicized 2015, it finally feels pos-
sible to approach Thug with a clear 
head, with novelty aside and music 
at the forefront. Slime Season 3 is a 
solid entryway to do just that. It’s 
Young Thug’s least cluttered, most 
streamlined 
and 
approachable 

tape so far, and it solidifies him as 
a clear staple of the rap scene, your 
personal feelings aside.

All of the elements of a clas-

sic Young Thug release are here. 
There’s the undeniable banger, 
“With Them,” which is the more 
labored and paced cousin of “F 
Cancer.” “Worth It” is a lavish 
love song, and perhaps his most 
heart-on-the-sleeve dedication to 
fiancé Jerrika Karlae yet. The tape 
is a tasting board of sorts, with the 
most obvious signatures of Thug 
stretched out and applied to an 
entire release. Absent, though, are 
the far left field experiments that 
appear on his less linear works.

This newfound focus acts as a 

double-edged sword. The major-
ity of criticism weighted against 
Thug’s earlier releases revolved 
around a lack of project cohesion. 
The two previous tapes in the 
Slime Season trilogy sprawled for 
over an hour each, and alternated 
between greatness and filler, like a 
gold mine that needed to be hacked 
away at. With his last release, I’m 
Up (billed as a “retail mixtape”), 
we saw Thug taking heed of that 
criticism, offering just nine songs 
and cutting his normal release 
output in half. The result was an 
improved project, but an under-
whelming collection of tracks. 
There were no clear stand-outs, 
and the replay value was minimal. 
Slime Season 3 sees Thug applying 
that same reductive hand to a more 
successful result. There are no 
serious lulls, which can mostly be 
attributed to the hack-job that was 
done here — the tape clocks in at 
just 28 minutes. But there are also, 
unsurprisingly, far less gems than 

the earlier Slime Season tapes.

That’s not to say Slime Season 

3 doesn’t have highlights. “Dig-
its,” the best here, is a nihilistic 
shrug that still manages to achieve 
anthem status. “Why not risk life 
when it’s gon’ keep going? / When 
you die somebody else was born,” 
Thug asserts, demonstrating deep-
er lyricism than his non-sequiturs 
(“I’mma pull out screaming hokey 
pokey okey”) lead on. Opener 
banger “With Them” is an exercise 
in word acrobatics, weaving double 
and triple entendres together with 
deceptive ease. But, like I’m Up, 
the best moments here don’t reach 
the level that Thug’s 2015 stand-
outs did. Nothing here is as oddly 
cathartic as “Calling Your Name,” 
as arresting as “Just Might Be” or 
as irresistible as “Best Friend.”

In many ways this is the com-

mercial release that debut album 
Barter 6 was expected to be (but 
wasn’t): less experimental, more 
straightforward and easier for 
the masses to consume. But that’s 
dangerous territory for the Atlanta 
rapper, who thrives on the unpre-
dictable. Where Barter 6 succeed-
ed in eschewing typical notions of 
who, or what, “Young Thug” could 
be, Slime Season 3 leans on the safer 
side. Thus we get the first release 
by the artist that could have actu-
ally been anticipated. For now, this 
doesn’t take away from the artist’s 
work — Slime Season 3 is a solid 
tape front to back. But consistency 
has a tendency to dull, and we can 
only hope that where he goes next, 
no one knows.

“

You’re in fucking outer 
space.”

These are the words 

that “Girls”’s 
Shoshanna 
hears on 
last week’s 
episode right 
before she 
ditches her 
boyfriend 
and walks 
home alone 
through the 
Tokyo streets 
at night. As 
the camera stays motionless 
and Shoshanna’s isolated back 
becomes smaller and smaller, 
one of the most devastatingly 
beautiful cover songs I’ve ever 
heard plays and the credits 

begin to roll.

19-year-old Norwegian 

singer Aurora’s version of 
David Bowie’s “Life on Mars” 
soundtracks an out of place and 
uncertain Shoshanna, and it’s 
artistic perfection. Sparsely 
arranged — just a keyboard and 
a young voice — and stunningly 
delicate, “Life on Mars” was on 
constant repeat for me in the 
days following its airing. I’ve 
never heard anything like it.

The idea that someone could 

actually record a superior ver-
sion of a David Bowie classic 
is something I’ve struggled 
to come to terms with in the 
past week, but Aurora does 
it. It’s crushing to me how 
restrained she stays, how she 
uses nothing but her voice to 
keep you engaged. She drags 
out every phrase of Bowie’s 
surreal poetry, moaning to 
stick words together, making 
her voice high-jump to reach 
the first notes of the choruses, 
pronouncing “fighting in the 
dancehall” like her mouth isn’t 
quite under control. It’s impos-
sible not to be enthralled.

In this particular scene, with 

the added subtext of David 
Bowie’s mortality, “Life on 
Mars” places Shoshanna as this 
tiny, tiny dot in an unknowably 
large universe, walking through 
what might as well be a dream 
for all its frustrating, confusing 
twists. She’s looking for life; 
she’s looking for a spark, trying 
to find herself in a world that 
too often feels cold and airless. 
I don’t know if I’ll ever be able 
to get that episode’s closing 
sequence out of my head.

But if you regularly watch 

Lena Dunham’s “Girls,” the fact 
that the show uses music in the 
most incredible ways is not new 
news. My introduction to the 
show was Lee Moses, this old 
soul guy with a voice like the 
devil and a thrilling, obscure 
set of recordings. A friend 
played his song “Bad Girl,” and 
its white-hot sound blew me 
away so much I needed to know 
where it came from.

“ ‘Girls,’ ” she said. “That’s 

where I get all my music from.”

I spent the next weeks play-

ing Lee Moses for every single 
person I hung out with, implor-
ing them to understand just 
how shockingly, historically, 
mind-blowing “Bad Girl” was. A 
year later, I’ve burned through 
four seasons of “Girls” and now 
get really excited every Sunday 
night, because each episode 
always ends up inspiring me. 
And “Bad Girl” remains one 
of the greatest songs I’ve ever 
heard.

And these amazing songs 

are all over “Girls.” One epi-
sode ends with this unbeliev-
ably fucked-up bedroom scene 
that I can’t describe because 
my mom reads this column, 
but as the credits start they’re 
soundtracked by Belle & Sebas-
tian’s “I Don’t Love Anyone,” 
which taken together is one of 
the most audacious things I’ve 
ever seen on TV. In another, 
Ray argues with a DJ for 
switching his Smashing Pump-
kins to LMFAO, hilariously 
yammering on about a “breach 
of contract.” New Order’s “Age 
of Consent” plays at a party, and 
that made me totally reevalu-
ate “Age of Consent,” because 
I always thought of it as this 

secretly incredible song that 
could only be passed on by one 
person playing it for another. 
Marnie breaks my heart for 
singing this awful, embarrass-
ing a capella version of Kanye 
West’s “Stronger” in front of a 
room full of strangers. Adam 
punches a car stereo to turn off 
Maroon 5 and ends up inad-
vertently quoting The Rolling 
Stones.

So I’ve been going back over 

all these great musical moments 
in the show and trying to figure 
out what makes them so great. 
And okay, like 90 percent of it is 
just Lena Dunham (or whoever 
makes the musical choices) hav-
ing incredible taste. But at the 
same time, “Girls” is the perfect 
show for maximizing the poten-
tial of music to complement 
characters and scenes.

I see this ability best all the 

way back in the first season, 
when Robyn’s “Dancing On 
My Own” closes out an early 
episode. Hannah is moping 
and turns on it, proceeding to 
dance out her feelings. Marnie 
walks in, they share a laugh 
about Hannah’s ex being gay 
and Marnie starts to dances 
along as the camera pans out. 
And sure, these characters are 
not good people, and it’s impos-
sible to truly love them like you 
would a lot of TV protagonists. 
But there’s a strange beauty 
in how music affects our emo-
tions, how it can turn some 
shitty feelings into an unfor-
gettable moment with a friend, 
and observing that on a weekly 
basis is a treat.

“Girls” is, at its core, a cel-

ebration of being alone (or, if 
you want to be more charitable, 
call it independence). None of 
its characters are good people, 
and every relationship over 
the course of its four-plus sea-
sons has ended up trashed. It’s 
a little exaggerated, and it’s 
often a certain brand of flawed, 
straight whiteness that can be 
difficult to identify with, but 
it’s not crazy different from the 
real world, at least compared 
to most TV shows. People who 
think they’re in love sometimes 
push each other apart, we 
occasionally act like assholes to 
our friends and we go through 
lengthy stretches where we 
don’t know who the fuck we 
are.

And that’s when music is 

there for us. When we want 
confidence, support, reassur-
ance and fun, we can always 
turn on a song. Music is there to 
make us dance with hot strang-
ers or cry in our rooms by our-
selves or scream along to with 
our friends at 2 a.m. Songs are 
there to start conversations and 
arguments, to melt away stress 
or disappointment. Music exists 
to mend severed connections, 
and when they’re unmendable, 
it’s there to make it OK. And 
whoever the genius is behind 
soundtrack of “Girls,” whether 
it’s Lena Dunham or some 
unknown hero, she gets it. We 
can be all the way off in outer 
space, away from our friends 
or away from ourselves, but as 
long as we have music, we’re 
never totally gone.

Theisen can’t always get 

what he wants, but if he tries 

sometimes, you’ll e-mail him 

at ajtheis@umich.edu.

Nieves, Selman sign pro deals

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Editor

Just two days after the 

Michigan hockey team’s season 
ended after it was bounced from 
the NCAA Tournament, two 
Wolverines signed professional 
contracts to play in the National 
Hockey League.

These 
contracts 
were 

expected. Early Monday, it was 
reported that senior forward Boo 
Nieves signed a contract with the 
New York Rangers. Later in the 
day, fellow senior forward Justin 
Selman followed suit, signing 
with the St. Louis Blues.

“It’s just special for us,” Selman 

said. “It’s a close group of three 
guys, and we’re kind of living the 
dream right now.”

The two alternate captains 

finish their Michigan careers 
as two of just three seniors in 
a class that once also included 
players such as Jacob Trouba 
and Andrew Copp, who left the 
Wolverines early for the NHL. 
The duo played on the same line 
with junior forward Alex Kile for 
a majority of the season.

The Rangers originally drafted 

Nieves with their second-round 
pick (59th overall) in 2012.

A Baldwinsville, N.Y., native, 

Nieves will immediately report 
to the Rangers’ top affiliate, 
the American Hockey League’s 
Hartford Wolf Pack, where he 
will be on an amateur tryout 
contract before his two-year deal 
kicks in next season. Nieves will 
finish out his academic career at 
Michigan this summer.

“It only took only a few hours 

(of 
negotiation 
on 
Sunday), 

pretty hassle-free,” Nieves said. 
“It shows how much they believe 
in me.

“It hasn’t really sunk in yet. So 

far I’ve only signed a few papers. 
I’m definitely really excited, but 
I don’t think it’s going to sink in 
until I’m out there in Hartford.”

Nieves totaled 110 points (28 

goals, 82 assists) in his Michigan 
career, with his best season 
coming this year, when he hit a 
double-digit goal tally (10) for 
the first time while donning the 
maize and blue.

Known as one of the faster 

players on the team, Nieves’ 
speed and big build (6-foot-3, 200 
pounds) should bode well for his 
chances of NHL success.

“Michigan’s done a lot for me,” 

Nieves said. “On the ice, I’ve 
matured physically. In particular, 
I’ve gotten a lot better at faceoffs 
and D-zone coverage. Off the 
ice, it’s more just growing up as 
a person and learning to use my 
time. It’s easy to (get) distracted 
with school and everything else 
going on, but it’s really taught me 

to manage my time. I’m really 
excited to take the next step.”

An Upper Saddle River, N.J., 

native, Selman will begin his 
pro career with the Blues’ top 
affiliate, 
the 

AHL’s Chicago 
Wolves. 
Like 

Nieves, Selman 
will also be on 
an 
amateur 

tryout contract 
before his two-
year entry-level 
contract takes 
effect 
next 

season.

“Luckily 

there is another Michigan guy, 
Scooter Vaughan,” Selman said. 
“So hopefully, he’ll take me under 
his wing.”

Selman was invited to and 

attended a development camp 
with the Blues this past summer, 
and the St. Louis club has kept 
an eye on him throughout the 

season.

“It was a 

great learning 
experience, 
and I thought 
I had a good 
chance,” 
Selman 
said. 

“The meetings 
with 
the 

coaches 
and 

staff 
went 

really well.”

He was undrafted when he 

arrived at Michigan, but carved 
out a niche for himself with his 
strong puck handling ability and 

developed as one the Wolverines’ 
better two-way players.

He finishes his career at 

Michigan with 66 points (29 goals, 
37 assists), and also had his best 
scoring output this past season 
with 13 goals and 17 assists.

“Just playing with the best 

players in the country and in 
the world — like Jacob Trouba a 
couple of years ago,” Selman said. 
“Day in and day out, you develop 
without even realizing it.”

Selman will also finish out 

his academic career at Michigan 
this summer.

“This is all really icing on the 

cake,” Selman said. “Ultimately, 
a Michigan education is really 
important to me and my family.”

Daily Sports Writer Justin 

Meyer contributed reporting.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Senior forwards Boo Nieves and Justin Selman have signed professional contracts with the New York Rangers and St. Louis Blues, respectively.

“It’s just special 
for us ... we’re 

kind of living the 
dream right now.”

Loss shows 

Michigan’s 

uneven play
J

unior right-hander Megan 
Betsa jogged out into 
the circle to replace Sara 

Driesenga. Northwestern had 
come out strong in the fifth 
inning Friday 
against the 
fifth-year 
senior right-
hander, and 
Sabrina 
Rabin’s RBI single had just cut 
the Wolverines’ lead to 7-3. 
Betsa needed to record only one 
more out to stop the bleeding.

But she couldn’t get it. She hit 

the first Northwestern batter 
and allowed two runs to score 
with wild pitches and three 
walks — the last of which came 
with the bases loaded.

The Wolverines ended up 

losing, 13-12, to Northwestern 
after blowing an early lead 
and failing to complete a late 
comeback attempt. The loss 
displayed Michigan’s biggest 
problem: inconsistency.

“I want my team to not be 

afraid of whatever the hell 
they’re afraid of,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins after the 
loss Friday. “Right now, they’re 
caught up in their status, and 
their status is they are last in the 
Big Ten right now. So hopefully 
you’ll see a fighting, attacking 
team on all ends — pitchers, 
hitters and fielders.”

Though the Wolverines have 

started out the season with a 
23-3 record, there have been 
bumps along the way: an 8-0 
run-rule loss to No. 1 Florida, a 
6-5 loss to No. 10 Washington 
and close calls against No. 16 
UCLA and Illinois State.

Against the Gators, both the 

pitching and the offense lacked, 
while defensive miscues cost 
Michigan against the Huskies.

And if the Wolverines hope 

to reach the Women’s College 
World Series again, they have to 
avoid performances like Friday’s.

Their troubles start with the 

pitching staff, which consists 
of junior right-hander Megan 
Betsa, fifth-year senior right-
hander Sara Driesenga and 
sophomore right-hander Tera 
Blanco.

It isn’t as if Betsa, Driesenga 

and Blanco aren’t talented or 
experienced enough — it’s more 
that they haven’t pitched like 
they’re capable of.

Hutchins has said before that 

she wants her pitchers to have 
more confidence in their defense 
and offense and that they don’t 
need to be perfect.

It certainly seemed, though, 

that they were trying too hard 
to be perfect in the loss Friday 
afternoon. The three pitchers 
threw a combined eight walks 
and also hit two batters, trying 
too hard to paint the corners 
when they should’ve thrown 
more strikes.

Considering all the self-

induced damage, it appears that 
the staff needs to remember 
that they are backed by a 
competent defense and one 
of the best — if not the best 
— offensive lineups in the 
country. But even that potent 
batting order initially failed 
to respond to Northwestern’s 
offensive outburst until the 
final frame.

The offense, which had been 

listless in the fifth and sixth 
innings even as the deficit grew, 
awoke in the bottom of the 
seventh and scored five runs — 
but it was too little, too late.

“I told them, ‘You fought like 

hell in one inning,’ ” Hutchins 
said. “But that’s not acceptable, 
because there are seven innings 
in the game.”

On Saturday and Sunday, 

the Wolverines fought like hell 
for the entirety of the game, 
bludgeoning the Wildcats 
on their way to two run-rule 
victories. With a long road back 
to Oklahoma City, Michigan 
will need to heed its coach’s 
advice every game if it hopes 
to be in the same position later 
this year.

Zach Werenski could sign an NHL contract as soon as Tuesday.
Werenski in talks 
with Blue Jackets

By JASON RUBINSTEIN 

Daily Sports Writer

With 
the 
talent 
the 

Michigan hockey team brings 
in each year, early NHL 
defections are inevitable. And 
this year is no different.

As 
early 
as 
Tuesday, 

sophomore defenseman Zach 
Werenski is expected to sign 
with the Columbus Blue Jackets. 
As of Monday night, Werenski 
has been in contract talks with 
the Blue Jackets, according to 
sources close to the team.

Werenski, 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Defenseman of the Year, was 
drafted eighth overall in the 
2015 NHL Draft. The 18-year-
old had a breakout sophomore 
season. He tallied 11 goals and 
24 assists during the season, 
and his 35 points ranked fourth 
on the team. He also anchored 
the Wolverines’ nation-leading 
power-play unit.

Werenski 
came 
back 
to 

Michigan for his sophomore 
season after a strong freshman 
year, which he said was a 
difficult decision.

“I wanted to come back here 

to learn as a player, just grow 
my game in all three zones,” 
Werenski told the Daily earlier 
this year. “The main thing is 
learning and becoming a better 
player. I think I did a good job 
of that in the first half (of the 
season). I think that really 
showed at World Juniors — how 
good of a job Michigan has done 
developing their players.”

He added that he most wanted 

to improve his physical play.

“I came in with that as one of 

my goals — to play harder, play 
more physical,” Werenski said.

Werenski, a Grosse Pointe, 

Mich., native, also captained 
Team USA to a bronze medal 
at 
the 
2015 
World 
Junior 

Championships.

Where Werenski will play this 

season is still uncertain — he may 
report to Columbus, or he could 
play for the American Hockey 
League’s Lake Erie Monsters.

Wolverines continue 
homestand Tuesday

Fresh off four-game 

sweep of Illinois-
Chicago, ‘M’ hosts 
Central Michigan

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

After 17 consecutive road 

games, the Michigan baseball 
team 
swept 
the 
University 

of 
Illinois-

Chicago in its 
home-opening 
series.

Now, 
the 

20th-ranked 
Wolverines 
(16-5) will take 
on 
Central 

Michigan (1-2 
Mid-American, 
5-19 
overall) 

Tuesday 
afternoon 
at 

Ray 
Fisher 

Stadium. 
Michigan 
defeated 
the 

Chippewas in the two games 
the teams played against each 
other last year, 5-3 and 6-5, 
respectively.

On paper, Central Michigan 

does not appear to be a formidable 
challenge for the Wolverines. 
The Chippewas have won only 
one road game this season, have 
a team batting average of .237 
and an earned-run average of 
6.94. Contrastingly, Michigan is 
hitting .303 and has a team ERA 
of 2.39.

But Central Michigan does 

have two clear playmakers in its 
batting lineup. Shortstop Zach 
McKinstry is currently hitting 
.351, with 34 hits and nine RBI 
while left fielder Daniel Jipping 
is batting .282, with three home 
runs and 15 RBI.

“We’re just going to keep 

focusing one pitch at a time, one 
inning at a time,” said junior 
first baseman and right-handed 

pitcher Carmen Benedetti. “I 
have full faith in the guys that 
we’re going to play well, play 
hard and the results will take 
care of themselves.”

While 
Michigan’s 
offense 

scored more than six runs just 
three 
times 

prior to the 
series against 
Illinois-
Chicago, 
the 

Wolverines 
accomplished 
the feat twice 
against 
the 

Flames, 
scoring 
10 

runs in two of 
their games.

And Central Michigan will 

face 
Benedetti 
and 
senior 

catcher Harrison Wenson at the 
worst possible time, as both are 
hot at the plate.

Wenson 
was 
particularly 

impressive against the Flames. 
He recorded eight hits in 15 
at-bats and drove in nine runs. 
Wenson’s biggest moment came 
in Friday’s contest, when he 
blasted a two-run home run to 
put Michigan ahead 4-2 en route 
to a 10-2 victory. Wenson is now 
hitting .417 on the season.

Benedetti 
shined 
for 
the 

Wolverines as well. He went 
8-for-13 against Illinois-Chicago 
and scored the game-winning 
run off a single by senior 
centerfielder Cody Bruder in 
the bottom of the ninth inning 
in Michigan’s 5-4 win Sunday. 
Benedetti’s 
batting 
average 

increased from .298 to .357 over 
the weekend.

“Just sliding into home plate 

(on Bruder’s single) was a pretty 
fun feeling,” Benedetti said. “I 
had full intentions of scoring. 
(Bruder) hit the ball really hard 
up the middle, and I knew there 
was going to be a play at the 
plate. So I just had to run hard 
and do my best to score.”

Sophomore designated hitter 

Drew Lugbauer didn’t hold back 

in his praise for his teammates.

“Harrison 
Wenson 
and 

Carmen Benedetti have quality 
at-bats all of the time,” Lugbauer 
said on Sunday.

As if all of that weren’t 

enough, 
Benedetti 
pitched 

2.2 
shutout 

innings 
of 

relief Sunday 
and struck out 
four batters.

Against the 

Flames, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
starting 
pitching 
anchored 
them 
once 

again. 

Sophomore left-hander Oliver 
Jaskie, junior left-hander Brett 
Adcock and sophomore right-
hander Ryan Nutof each pitched 
at least six innings, gave up 
fewer than three runs and 
earned a victory.

However, since Michigan will 

be playing on only one day’s rest, 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
said to expect a starter outside 
of the main rotation.

“You can’t start a guy on 

that short (a period) of rest,” 
Bakich said. “So we’ll have a new 
starter.”

But 
he 
didn’t 
offer 
any 

specifics as to whom that might 
be.

“(The starter) will either be 

a lefty or a righty,” Bakich said 
with a grin. “I’ll have to talk to 
(pitching coach Sean) Kenny 
about it.”

While a new starter will 

present an unknown for the 
Wolverines, 
the 
fact 
that 

Michigan’s bats have been hot 
and teams are hitting .303 off 
of the Chippewas might just 
propel the Wolverines to victory 
anyway.

Michigan wins thriller

Wolverines take 
the lead with 7.8 
seconds left, then 
hold off Temple

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

Twelve lead changes — all in 

the fourth quarter — did little 
justice in capturing the excitement 
witnessed at Crisler Center on 
Monday night.

It was pure joy for the Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team 
(21-

13), 
which 

advanced to the WNIT semifinals 
for the second straight year after 
a down-to-the-wire battle with 
Temple.

The Wolverines won, 77-76, and 

will advance to play Florida Gulf 
Coast on the road Thursday night.

Temple (23-12) led by 15 in 

the first quarter, but Michigan’s 
furious third-quarter rally tied 
the game at 60 heading into the 
final stretch.

On 
the 
Wolverines’ 
final 

offensive possession, they needed 
four 
consecutive 
offensive 

rebounds before freshman center 
Hallie Thome scored the go-ahead 
layup with 7.8 seconds to go.

Chance after chance, each shot 

bounced off the rim, but Thome 
— treading dangerously with four 
personal fouls — banked in the 
much-needed last attempt.

“We knew we needed a basket 

and kept fighting after the ball 
and giving ourselves second and 
third and fourth opportunities,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “It was a great finish by 
(Thome), but then we had to get 
two stops to seal it, and that was 
even more impressive.”

Temple nearly stole back the 

lead on the ensuing play. Guard 
Feyonda Fitzgerald drove to the 
basket for a layup but was met in 

the paint by Michigan’s Danielle 
Williams. The ball rolled around 
the rim three times before 
falling out, but it was of little 
importance, as Williams had 
already drawn a charge.

“Honestly, it was a ‘I happened 

to be in the right place, right time’ 
kind of thing,” Williams said. “I 
was really excited, but there was 
five seconds left on the clock, so 
I was like, ‘We still need to win, 
we still need to 
win.’ ”

A 
turnover 

on the inbounds 
play gave the 
Owls one last 
chance, but that 
shot 
bounced 

off the rim, and 
the Wolverines 
could 
finally 

breathe.

A series of 

clutch performances culminated 
in the dramatic ending. There 
was a third-quarter buzzer beater 
from sophomore guard Katelynn 
Flaherty, relentless drives from 
senior guard Madison Ristovski 

and lights-out shooting from 
junior guard Siera Thompson.

And those were just a few 

of the contributions that led to 
Thome’s final shot and Williams’ 
drawn charge.

“I’m just happy that (Thome) 

stuck with it,” Flaherty said of the 
last play. “It’s been a big battle all 
year for her, to stay with plays and 
keep rebounding. She was tough 
and won the whole game for us.”

As Flaherty 

mentioned, 
Thome’s 
big 

moment stands 
out 
during 

a 
season 
in 

which stronger 
opponents 
have 
knocked 

the 
freshman 

around. She is 
6-foot-5, 
but 

Temple had a 

match for her with 6-foot-3 center 
Ugo Nwaigwe.

Nonetheless, Thome had two 

of the four offensive rebounds on 
the last play, a testament to her 
continuous growth.

Flaherty ended the night with 

a team-high 23 points, with 18 of 
those coming in the second half.

Temple built a 17-2 lead as 

the Wolverines committed six 
turnovers in the first quarter, but 
Flaherty, Ristovski and Thompson 
were all scoreless at that point.

Once they got going and started 

to hit shots, it was a whole new 
ballgame.

The 
Wolverines’ 
second-

quarter outing was far better 
than their first, but their 10-point 
deficit at halftime meant they still 
had a ways to go.

They held Temple scoreless for 

the first five minutes of the second 
quarter, though, and Michigan 
went on a 9-0 run to cut a 15-point 
deficit down to five.

All nine points came from 

Ristovski, who scored 13 of the 
Wolverines’ 23 in the second 
quarter, helping cut the Owls’ lead 
to five.

That 
set 
the 
stage 
for 

pandemonium at Crisler, and 
the impossible comeback sent 
Michigan onward and upward to 
the WNIT semifinals.

Wolverines make plays 
down the stretch in win

Williams’ charge 
sets up Michigan’s 
game-winning shot 

in final seconds

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

Madison Ristovski had the 

ball in her hands on the inbounds 
pass with 4.6 seconds left and her 
Wolverines up by one. Temple 
players scurried right and left in 
her line of vision, doing their best 
to deny Michigan the ball. The 
Owls succeeded in their effort 
to get the ball back, as Ristovski 
threw the ball out of bounds.

Though the Wolverines lost 

possession, they stifled Temple 
from 
scoring 
on 
the 
next 

possession when the last-second 
attempt rimmed out. That was 
the case for most of the game — 
Michigan was closer to losing 
than in any other matchup of the 
WNIT, but it made plays when it 
needed to.

“I think throughout the whole 

year, I’ve always made the right 
pass, and I messed up,” Ristovski 
said. “I threw it out of bounds, 
(sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty) got pushed, whatever 
happened. With five seconds left, 
with that timeout, (Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico) really 
said, ‘You saw that opportunity 
to win the game, all you have to 
do is get a stop.’ ”

Even before the final result 

was set in stone, it was evident 
from the first minute of play 
that Temple was different from 
other opponents the Michigan 
women’s basketball team had 
encountered in the WNIT. The 
Owls had to guard Michigan’s 
6-foot-5 freshman center Hallie 
Thome, but initially, instead of 
guarding Thome with one of her 
tallest players, Temple coach 
Tonya Cardoza elected to use 
5-foot-9 guard Tanaya Atkinson.

Despite 
the 
height 

disadvantage, the plan worked 
in the first quarter, as the Owls 
were able to intercept passes 
while the Wolverines focused 
on getting the ball into the post. 
Thome managed just two points 
in the first quarter and Michigan 
coughed up six turnovers, all 
occurring within the first five 
minutes of the contest.

With 
the 
unorthodox 

approach to defense, Temple 
held the Wolverines to just nine 
points in the first quarter to 
take a 23-9 lead. The Owls didn’t 
score their next basket until five 
minutes were left in the second 
quarter, while Michigan started 
the quarter on a 9-0 run. Temple 
recovered 
to 
take 
a 

10-point 
lead 

into halftime, 
capped off by 
a 3-pointer in 
the 
waning 

seconds 
of 

the 
scrappy 

first half that 
included 
five 

jump-ball 
calls.

“We knew, Coach Arico told 

us, that they were a really good 
first-quarter team,” said junior 
guard Danielle Williams. “We 
needed to play harder, honestly. 
A lot of it was just effort at the 
beginning, and we had to leave 
it all out there. It could’ve been 
our last game, and it almost 
was. (We needed to) just leave 
it all out there, play really hard, 
play smart and see what they’re 
giving you to play as a team.”

In the first half, the Wolverines 

went 13-for-37 from the floor to 
shoot 35 percent. Though the 
Owls held Thome and Flaherty to 
a combined 10 points in the first 20 
minutes of action, the Wolverines 
stayed close with the help of 
Ristovski, who led Michigan with 
13 points. With her leading the 
way, the Wolverines committed 
only one turnover in the second 
quarter to give them momentum 
heading into the third.

The Owls stalled Flaherty 

in the first half, but had no 
success containing her in the 
third quarter. Flaherty found an 
offensive spark, knocking down 
two 3-pointers before the final 
minute of the quarter.

Then 
the 
fireworks 
really 

started. 
Senior 
guard 
Siera 

Thompson 
followed 
Flaherty 

with a 3-pointer of her own, only 
to be followed by another basket 
by Flaherty at the buzzer to tie 
the game at 60 with the crowd on 
its feet to start the fourth quarter.

“We executed well down the 

stretch and kind of relaxed more 
and took our time,” Flaherty said. 
“In the beginning, we were kind 

of 
throwing 

up some shots 
and not being 
patient.”

With 

Flaherty 
driving to the 
basket within 
the last minute 
of the game, 
the 
Owls 

blocked 
her 

attempt, but the Wolverines kept 
possession after the rejection 
went out of bounds with 33 
seconds left. On the ensuing 
possession, 
Temple 
halted 

Michigan 
three 
times 
with 

hard-nosed defense, but Thome 
hauled down a rebound and put 
in a layup to give the Wolverines 
a lead.

Then the Wolverines closed out 

the game for good. Michigan was 
put to the test Monday night, but 
intangibles made the difference in 
the toughest matchup it has faced 
in the WNIT. The Wolverines 
fought through poor shooting and 
an aggressive defensive effort by 
their opponent, but wouldn’t be 
denied when a play needed to be 
made.

“We needed a total team effort 

to be successful,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico, “and 
everyone that came in really 
contributed to that and bought 
into that mentality.”

“It could’ve 
been our last 
game, and it 
almost was.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Albrecht to play next 
year as grad transfer

By SIMON KAUFMAN and 

LEV FACHER 

Daily Sports Editor and Daily 

Sports Writer

Spike 
Albrecht 
has 
been 

granted his release to transfer 
and will play out his final season 
of eligibility elsewhere. ESPN 
first reported the news Tuesday 
night, and Albrecht confirmed it 
with the Daily shortly thereafter 
over the phone.

Albrecht 
announced 

in 
December 
that 
he 
was 

prematurely ending his season 
due to a longer-than-expected 
rehabilitation process following 
a pair of hip surgeries he 
underwent over the summer. 

Soon after the announcement, 
however, Michigan coach John 
Beilein raised the possibility of 
a fifth year for the fan favorite, 
and Albrecht later indicated that 
his status for the 2016-17 season 
would be determined as much by 
his health as by the Wolverines’ 
scholarship situation.

While Albrecht apparently 

expects to be healthy enough to 
play next November, Michigan’s 
roster outlook seems to have been 
less forgiving. The Wolverines 
are already one scholarship over 
their limit for next year, with one 
open spot carrying over from the 
current season, two graduating 
seniors 
and 
an 
incoming 

recruiting class of four members.
