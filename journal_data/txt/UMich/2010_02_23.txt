Bank of America
contract won't change
after new policy went
into effect yesterday
By TORREY ARMSTRONG
Daily StaffReporter
The Credit CARD Act, a piece
of federal legislation reforming
credit card laws and limiting
some of the credit card indus-
try's most profitable and punitive
practices, took effect yesterday
after being signed into law in
May.
The law bans companies from
issuing credit cards to anyone
under 21 unless they have an
adult co-signer or can demon-
strate the ability to repay the
debt through a financial back-
ground check.
While some have praised the
legislation as protecting college
students from being targeted by
the credit card industry, others
have decried the restrictions it
places on students' and teenag-
ers' abilities to apply for credit
cards.
President Barack Obama said
in a statement released yesterday

that the law will make the pro-
cess of applying for a credit card
more transparent.
"These new rules don't absolve
consumers of their obligation to
pay their bills, but they finally
level the playing field so that
every family and small busi-
ness using a credit card has the
information they need to make
responsible financial decisions,"
Obama said in the statement.
Though the legislation could
have far reaching implications
for the way credit card compa-
nies advertise to students, Jerry
Sigler, senior vice president and
chief financial officer of the
University's Alumni Associa-
tion, said the new laws will not
significantly affect the Alumni
Association's contract with Bank
of America.
The Daily reported in Febru-
ary 2009 that, under the con-
tract, the Alumni Association
provides Bank of America with
student and alumni information
in exchange for revenue based on
the number of accounts opened
with that information.
According to Sigler, the pro-
gram mostly targets alumni,
which is why it won't be signifi-
cantly affected by the legislation.

Charlie White,
Meryl Davis bested
by Canadian pair in
Vancouver last night
Staffand Wire Reports
University students Meryl
Davis and Charlie White danced
their way to second place last
night in Vancouver, earning sil-
ver medals for the United States
Olympic team.

Davis and White's silver was
the 25th medal for the U.S. team,
matching its record set in 2006
for medals won at a non-domestic
Olympics and giving the United
States back-to-back ice dance
medals for the firsttime ever.
With the medal, the Americans
are now all butcguaranteed to sur-
pass that 25 medal-win notch, as
the U.S. women's hockey team can
do no worse than a silver medal
after advancing to the finals.
In an interview last night,
Davis told The Associated Press
she was thrilled with winningthe

silver medal.
"There is so much to be proud
of right now," Davis said.
Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir
of Canada, who finished with a
score of 221.57, bested-White and
Davis's score of 215.74. The Cana-
dian pair won the Olympic gold
medal in ice dance last night, an
ice dance first not only for Can-
ada, but also for any team from
North America.
The North American first and
second place pushed the Russians,
who have long held a spot atop the
ice dance podium, down to the

bronze medal. For only the third
time since ice dance became an
Olympic sport in 1976, a Russian
or Soviet couple did not win the
dance gold.
Reigning world champions
Oksana' Domnina and Maxim
Shabalin of Russia finished third.
Americans Tanith Belbin and Ben
Agosto, who were the silver med-
alists at the 2006 Olympics, came
in fourth.

ried couple stealing away for a

NCAA INVESTIGATION
'U' alum says he filed suit
to hold regents accountable

A PERSONAL STORY

Robert Davis alleges
regents violated
Open Meetings Act
By KYLE SWANSON
DailyNewsEditor
When University alum Robert
Davis slapped the University's
Board of Regents with a lawsuit
late last week, he said he simply
wanted to stress the importance
of holding the University's leaders

accountable.
Davis's lawsuit stems from a
special, informal meeting of the
Board of Regents held on Feb. 3
behind closed doors in University
President Mary Sue Coleman's
private conference room. A source
familiar with the situation told
The Michigan Daily at the time
that the focus of the meeting was
the NCAA's investigation into alle-
gations that the Michigan Football
team violated NCAA regulations
regarding the amount of time stu-
dent-athletes can spend in practice

and off-season workouts.
Davis's 34-page summons and
complaint filed in Washtenaw
County Circuit Court alleges the
University violated the Michigan
Open Meetings Act by holding the
meeting behind closed doors and
for refusing to release minutes
from the meeting, among other
claims.
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily yesterday, Davis said he
simply wanted the University's
governing board to comply with

Exploring education

For English Lecturer Aric
Knuth, the time and space stu-
dents and teachers have together
should be "something other than
a humanized version of reading a
book."
Instead, Knuth said he believes
classroom time shouldbe spent as
almost a back and forth between
students and instructors, allow-
ing students to relate better to
the text.
"I think a lot of times people
want a model of education that
isn't necessarily top-down,"
Knuth said.
Knuth brings this philoso-
phy with him when he travels to
Maine every spring as director of
the New England Literature Pro-
gram. The program takes 40 stu-
dents to a camp in the wilderness
to read texts on a dock or a rock in
the woods. There, students work
together and put themselves in

the context of the texts they're
reading, according to Knuth.
Knuth said some of the most
valuable things about the pro-
gram are the opportunities
afforded to students like getting
to hike and live in the cold with
limited heating and electricity.
But, he said one of his favorite
things about the program is liv-
ing without cell phones, comput-
ers, e-mails and Facebook for six
and a half weeks.
Knuth said that during his 13
years of involvement with the
program he has seen a variety
of responses to being away from
technology for this period of
time.
"It's amazing to be without
your computer for two months,
your brain does funny things,"
said Knuth. "I believe in experi-
mentation. And different things
have happened over time because

people have changed and because
people have changed the way that,
they use those technologies. Peo-
ple freak out now, those things
are such important parts of our
lives now."
He added that NELP aims tov
take students out of their comfort
zones because "that is where dis-
covery occurs."
Knuth's ties to the University
go beyond his current teaching
post and his long career with
NELP. He attended the Univer-
sity and majored in English.
After graduation he partici-
pated in Teach for America and
worked at a financial firm in New
York, before deciding to return
to the University for a graduate
degree in English and the oppor-°
tunity to teach undergraduates.
"I have a passion for teaching,"
he said. ANNA SCHULTE /Daily

Suspect pleads guilty of plotting
terrorist attack on NYC subways

Haitian orphans
detained in route
to United States

The Afghan man
told a judge he is
willing to be a
suicide bomber
NEW YORK (AP) - A former
airport shuttle driver accused of
buying beauty supplies to make
bombs for an attack on New York
City subways pleaded guilty yes-
terday, admitting he agreed to con-
duct an al-Qaida-led "martyrdom
operation" because of U.S. involve-
ment in his native Afghanistan.
Najibullah Zazi told a judge the
terror network recruited him to
be a suicide bomber in New York,
where he went to high school and

once worked a coffee cart just
blocks from the World Trade Cen-
ter site.
"I would sacrifice myself to
bring attention to what the U.S.
military was doing to civilians in
Afghanistan," Zazi said in court.
The Associated Press learned
earlier this month that the jailed
Zazi had recently volunteered
information about the bomb plot
in the first step toward a plea deal.
His cooperation suggests prosecu-
tors hope to expand the case and
bring charges against other sus-
pects in one of the most serious
terrorism threats in the U.S. since
Sept. 11,2001.
The officials spoke on condition
of anonymity because the terror
investigation is ongoing.

Zazi, 25, pleaded guilty to con-
spiring to use weapons of mass
destruction, conspiring to commit
murder in a foreign country and
providing material support for a
terrorist organization. He faces a
life prison sentence without parole
at a sentencing in June.
The bombings "could have
been devastating," Attorney Gen-
eral Eric Holder said in Washing-
ton. "This attempted attack on
our homeland was real, it was in
motion, and it would have been
deadly."
Zazi said in court he traveled
to Pakistan in 2008 to join the
Taliban and fight against the U.S.
military but was recruited by the
terrorist network in Peshewar
and went into a training camp in
Warziristan, a region of Pakistan
where al-Qaida is known to oper-
ate.

Zazi said he received weapons
training at the camp and learned
aboit explosives. He also said in
court that he had been in contact
with al-Qaida operatives while in
Pakistan, but he did not identify
them.
"During the training, al-Qaida
leaders asked us to return to the
United States and conduct mar-
tyrdom operation," he said. "We
agreed to this plan."
The Pakistan Embassy in Wash-
ington declined to comment on
Zazi's case.
Zazi admitted using notes taken
at the training camp to build
homemade explosives with beauty
supplies purchased in the Denver
suburbs and cooked up in a Colo-
rado hotel room. He then drove the
materials to New York just before
the eighth anniversary of the Sept.
11 terror attacks.


Missionaires were
trying to bring the
children to U.S.
families
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
- Six U.S.-bound orphans seized
by Haitian police despite having
their papers in order remained in
a government-run nursery more
than two days later, the orphanage
director said last night.
"The youngest has developed
diarrhea and is very dehydrated,"
said Jan Bonnema of Prinsburg,
Minnesota, founder and director
with her husband, Bud, of the Chil-
dren of The Promise orphanage,
where the children originated.
The seizure of the orphans and
their escorts' brief detention Satur-
day came amid fears foreigners are
exploiting post-earthquake chaos
to illegally take children form the
country. The ongoing case of 10
U.S. Baptist missionaries who tried
to remove children without proper
papers has fueled such fears.
Bonnema, whose orphanage is
located in the northern city of Cap-
Haitien, said the six children had
been bound for the United States
via Miami, where their adoptive
parents were waiting for them.
Police detained the children and
the four women escorting them,
including the orphanage's Irish field
director and one adoptive mother
from Minnesota, Sarah Thacker of
Ferbus Falls, as they were about to
depart this earthquake-shattered
country from Port-au-Prince airport
on Saturday, according to Bonnema.
"They were just inside the ter-
minal. They hadn't gone through
immigration," she said in a phone
interview from Minnesota, because
they were waiting for U.S. Embassy
staff to come with adoption papers
signedby Haiti's prime minister.
"A large group of Haitians
attacked them," Bonnema added.
"They were swearing at them and
saying, 'These are Haitian babies.
You cannot take them. You are
child trafficking."'
U.S. and Haitian officials had

earlier confirmed the detention
but without providing details.
The children, ages 1 to 5, and
women were all detained by police,
and the women were released sev-
eral hours later from a nearby police
station after U.S. diplomats 'inter-
vened.
But the children remained in a
government nursery in a tent camp
on Monday night, Bonnema said.
"Our staff were not allowed to
stay with the children," she said.
"They're very traumatized."
She said U.S. and Haitian offi-
cials were expected to meet Tues-
day to resolve the situation.
'Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobu-
char has intervened on behalf of
the women. She told The Associ-
ated Press that the orphanage is
legitimate and said the adopting
families in Minnesota have been
working with her office.
"The main thing now is to make
sure the kids are reunited with the
women and get to the families that
have been waiting for them," she
said.
The incident occurred after 10
Baptists were arrested trying to
take 33 Haitian children across the
border to the Dominican Republic
without the proper paperwork.
The missionaries said the chil-
dren were orphaned in the devas-
tating Jan. 12 earthquake, but the
AP established that they all had
parents who willingly gave their
children up in hopes they would
get an education and a better life.
A judge released eight of the
missionaries last week, but leader
Laura Silsby, 40, and her assistant,
Charisa Coulter, 24, remain jailed
as the investigating judge inter-
views officials at the orphanages
the two visited before the quake.
Bonnema said all orphans in
Children of The Promise "have
been in our care since they were
infants."
She said most are "true orphans
or they've been abandoned."
UNICEF says Haiti had some
380,000 orphans prior tothe quake
- nearly 4 percentofits population
- and an estimated half were not
true orphans. Child trafficking is a
major problem.

* Mich. civil rights
champion dies at
47, officials say
State officials say Michigan
Department of Civil Rights Direc-
tor Kelvin W. Scott has died of
cancer.
State Civil Rights Commission
Chairman Matthew Wesaw says
the 47-year-old Scott died Sat-
urday. Gov. Jennifer Granholm
appointed Scott to the rights com-
mission in 2004. He was named
the civil rights agency's director
last year.
Granholm called Scott "a great
* champion" of the civil rights cause
in a statement issued Sunday.
Scott had previously served as
an assistant U.S. attorneyin Mich-
igan's Eastern District.
He earned his law degree from
Georgetown University Law Cen-
ter and his bachelor's degree from
Michigan State University.
The state Department of Civil
Rights says Scott is survived by
his wife Ursula Henry and his par-
ents.
ANCHORAGE, Alaska
Body found of man
missing in ruin of
avalanche
Searchers have recovered the
body of a ConocoPhillips Alaska
employee missing and presumed
dead since a Feb. 13 avalanche on
the Kenai Peninsula that killed the
head of the company.
The body of 40-year-old Alan
Gage was found Monday near
Grandview.
Gage and 57-year-old Jim
Bowles, the president of Cono-
coPhillips Alaska, were killed
when the avalanche hit their
snowmobile party. Bowles' body
was recovered that day.
Gage was part of the Cono-
coPhillips capital projects team.
Rain, low clouds and other
foul weather, plus hazardous ava-
lanche conditions, kept searchers .
out of the area until Saturday.
Alaska State Troopers say up to
58 people since then have combed
an avalanche debris area a little
larger than a football field using
trained search dogs, probes and
other devices.

Obama praises
Senate for pushing
jobs bill forward
PresidentBarack Obamais prais-

helped push a bipartisan jobs bill
past a Republican filibuster.
After the bill passed a legisla-

Americans want to see Washington
put aside its partisanship and put
the country back to work. Obama

administration's efforts to repair
the economy. He says creating jobs
remains the White House's top pri-
ority.
The measure moved forward

with the backing of five Republi-

RAMADI, Iraq
3 killed in
bombing in Iraq's
Anbar province
Iraqi police say a car bomb tar-
geting a police building has killed
three people in the capital of Iraq's
western Anbar province.
The bombing comes as Iraq is
preparing for March 7 parliamen-
tary elections. Insurgents have
been repeatedly targeting govern-
ment institutions in Anbar and
the rest of Iraq in an attempt to
destabilize the country ahead of
the vote.
Police officials say a suicide
bomber exploded the car outside
the Internal Affairs office in the
provincial capital, Ramadi.
The officials spoke on condition
of anonymity because they were
not authorized to speak to the
media.
Anbar province was considered
the hotbed of the insurgency until
many fighters turned against the
insurgents in what is considered
one of the key turning points of
the war.

guez says the government must
V accelerate plans to reduce energy

New agree-ment puts
Lufthansa back in air

After less than 24
hours, the German
airline suspended
its strike
FRANKFURT (AP) - Luf-
thansa and its pilots are set to
return to the cockpit after the
German airline and a key union
agreed to halt a four-day strike
that disrupted travelers and was
poised to go on through Friday.
The four-day walkout ended
less than 24 hours after it began
after two hours in a Frankfurt
labor court that saw both sides
agree to suspend the strike and
hold talks, they said Monday
night.
Lufthansa confirmed the deci-
sion and said the walkout would
end at midnight (2300 GMT, 6
p.m. EST).
"The parties agreed in front
of the court that the strike is to
be suspended through the 8th of
March," Lufthansa spokesman
Andreas Bartels told AP, adding
the 4,000 pilots will return to
work Tuesday though it would
take some time for normal opera-
tions to resume.
"They're going to go back to
work tomorrow," he said.
Some 10,000 Lufthansa and
Germanwings passengers were
upended by the strike, which
began at 12:01 a.m. (2301 GMT,
6:01 p.m. EST) Monday and
ended at midnight.
Cockpit union spokesman
Joerge Handwerg said the strike
was suspended until March 9,
pending the resumption of talks
between both sides. Pilots for
Lufthansa Cargo and the low-
budget subsidiary, German-
wings, were also taking part in
the strike.
"We are happy with the agree-
ment because Lufthansa now has
to resume negotiations without
preconditions," Handwerg said.
Lufthansa pilots announced
the walkout last week over their
concerns that cheaper crews
from Lufthansa's smaller airlines
in other countries couldeventu-
ally replace them.
The Lufthansa strike disrupt-
ed plans for 10,000 passengers
worldwide, but that was just the
first of what was set to come this
week.

romantic evening. Their gentle,
slow start showcased their skat-
ing skills, their edges so quiet and
smooth they appeared to float
above the ice.
But make no mistake, there was
plenty of strength behind that
softness.
They had as much power and
speed as the hockey players Moir
admires so much, but it was per-
formed with balletic grace. Their
combination spin seemed to go on
forever, with many different posi-
tions and edge changes.
While Virtue and Moir were
all softness and grace, Davis and
White's "Phantom of the Opera"
was big and bold, as powerful as

any Broadway production. They
skated perfectly to their music,
flying across the ice in the fast
part and using deep edges to con-
vey romance and lyricism in the
slow parts.
Their lifts were akin to stunt
tricks, done at breakneck speed
yet with perfect control. In one,
White flipped Davis over his
shoulder so she faced the oppo-

day strike of their own starting
Tuesday that is forcing the can-
cellation of hundreds of flights at
Paris' Charles de Gaulle and Orly
airports. France's DGAC avia-
tion authority ordered airlines toa
cancel 50 percent of the flights at
Orly and 25 percent of the flights
at Charles de Gaulle.
French carrier Air France said
it would maintain all of its long-
haul flights during the strike,
with the protest movement
affecting only its routes within
France and Europe.
British Airways PLC, mean-
while, faced a renewed threat
of cabin crew strikes, after the
Unite union announced that
most of its members had voted in
favor of a walkout.
And Eurostar - the main train
alternative to planes between
Paris, Brussels and London -
experienced yet another embar-
rassing train failure.
A Eurostar Paris-to London
train inexplicably broke down in
southern England late Sunday,
plunging more than 700 passen-
gers into darkness and forcing
them to climb down ladders onto
the track to a replacement train.
They arrived in London about
2:30 a.m. (0230 GMT Monday,
9:30 p.m. EST Sunday), more
than four hours late.
Last week, Eurostar was
sharply criticized by inde-
pendent investigators for its
response when several trains
broke down before Christmas in
the Channel Tunnel, disrupting
travel plans for tens of thousands
of people.
All told, Monday was not a
good day for travelers.
Albert Carles and his wife
arrived at Frankfurt airport after
a 14-hour flight from'Vietnam to
find that their connecting flight
to Marseille was canceled and
trains to Paris were overbooked.
"There is no information, we
are left on our own," he told Ger-
man news agency DAPD. "We
have not eaten or drunk any-
thing."
While Lufthansa canceled
about 800 of its estimated 1,800
daily flights - including long-
haul flights to U.S. destina-
tions like New York and Denver
- Bartels said the airline will
move toward resuming its nor-
mal operations, but cautioned it
would not be immediate.

to normal operations. It takes a
lot of tioe."

his right leg and crossed it behind
him as she opened her arms, that
platform-like leg of his the only
thing keeping her from plunging
to the ice.
Their only flaw was a deduc-
tion, likely for an extended lift.
But it wouldn't have made a differ-
ence in the final results.
In a press release issued by the
University's Athletic Department
following the pair's performance,
Davis said she was proud of the
work she and White had done.
"We put in a really good perfor-
mance for us, we're really proud of
ourselves," Davis said following
their last skate. "So where we end
up is kind of out of our hands, but
we feel good."
White expressed his feelings
in an NBC news segment aired

before.the couple completed their
last skate.
"If there's one thing that can top
a Michigan football game it would
be an Olympic medal," White
told NBC, agcording a statement
released by the University's Ath-
letic Department.
In an interview with The Mich-
igan Daily earlier this month,
Davis expressed her excitement

The airline estimated the
strike would cost it around
euro25 million ($34 million) per
day.
The airline may face more
obstacles in coming weeks. Late
Monday, Germany's UFO cabin
crew union said in a statement
that it was considering walkouts
of its own "in the coming weeks."
In London, Unite - Britain's
biggest labor union - said after
the vote that it was not announc-
ing any strike date and its mem-
bers will meet Thursday to
discuss the ballot result before
deciding on a strike date.
A previous strike threat by
BA cabin crew - planned for the
Christmas and New Year's holi-
days - was canceled only after
the airline obtained an emergen-
cy court injunction blocking it.
Fears about job security were
the underlying theme for all the
airline work actions.
The French air traffic con-
trollers are upset about plans to
integrate European air traffic
operations, leaving them to face
new work rules, the loss of their
civil servant benefits or even
job cuts. British Airways cabin
crews don't want the company
to slash the number of employees
working on flights.
The Lufthansa pilots are seek-
ing increased work security and
want German labor conditions
to apply to Lufthansa pilots
hired abroad, in an effort to pre-
vent their jobs from migrating
to neighboring countries with
cheaper conditions. Lufthansa
has denied it was planning to
relocate the jobs.
Tony Concil of the Interna-
tional Air Transit Association in
Geneva noted that the global air-
line industry is still losing money
and still needs to cut operating
costs.
"The industry lost $11 billion
in 2009 and will probably lose
$5.6 billion in 2010," he told AP.
"The emphasis at airlines is sav-
ing cash, managing capacity as
effectively as possible, and cut-
ting costs."
Lufthansa reached out to
travelers online, posting a strike
schedule on its Web site and
offering flight updates on Twit-
ter.
But some travelers were still
caught unaware.
"We arrived in Frankfurt
from Taiwan. We have been on
the road for 24 hours," a Swiss
woman told AP Television News.
for the trip to Vancouver.
"This is an incredible oppor-
tunity, but you don't want to do
any more or less than we've been
doing, even though the audience
is that much bigger," Davis told
the Daily at the time. "I'm just
excited about the chance to show
the world what we've been putting
our hard work and sweat into our
whole lives."
Fellow Americans and Univer-
sity students Emily Samuelson
and Evan Bates took 11th place in
the ice dance competition.
The pair earned an 88.94 in
the free skate - besting their
personal record by eight points
- skating to Andrea Bocelli
and Sarah Brightman. Samu-
elson and Bates - who earned
an overall score of 174.30 - are
known for their footwork tal-

ents and strong lines, but were
not expected to make the 2010
Olympics. However, with their
placement, the duo is considered
to be a strong challenger for the
U.S. in the 2014 Olympic games
in Sochi.

Incident comes after
residence hall's
recent rash of
false fire alarms
By ANNIE GORDON THOMAS
and DARRYN FITZGERALD
Daily StaffReporters
While West Quad residents have
had to deal with the annoyance of
a spat of false fire alarms recently,
the residence hall was evacuated
for a reason last night. But that rea-
son was not a fire, officials say.
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown told
The Michigan Daily late last night
the evacuation of West Quad was
due to a sprinkler head being set off
-not a fire.
While the exact cause of the
sprinkler discharge was not known
as of 2 a.m. last night, Brown said
it was likely due to a sports-related
activity in the hallway where the
sprinkler head was broken. Brown
stressed the incident was not the
result of any system malfunction.
Residentswere allowed to return
to their rooms last night, but those
living in the affected hallway were
not being let back into their rooms.
. Brown said officials on the scene
were making accommodations for
students who would not be able to
return to their rooms for the night.
"Housing and DPS will be
working to determine if any of the
residents might need alternative
housing tonight," she said.

saying Arens has demonstrated
a desire to work on his drug and
alcohol problems which may have
been related to the offense and to
his past convictions of home inva-
sion, retail fraud and a juvenile
conviction of assault with inten-
tion to commit criminal sexual
conduct.
"I'm hoping and am optimis-
tic that he will get control of his
drinking and his drug problems,"
Mullins said. .
Following the statements, the
presiding judge Melinda Morris
sentenced Arens to a minimum
of 19 months to a maximum of
10 years in a Washtenaw County
Department of Corrections facil-
ity.
Mullins then spoke with Arens
for a few minutes before Arens
made the decision to set a trial
date to lessen his sentence.
After the sentencing, Judge
Morris also established that res-
titution for the building must be
set within 90 days. Morris said
if an agreement isn't reached on
the restitution amount within
90 days, a hearing will be sched-
uled.

Brown said it was too early to
tell how much water damage there
would be in the affected hall or
to the hall below it, but said more
would be known once the area had
been cleaned up and the damage
could be more fully assessed.
LSA sophomore Jason Zweig
said he was in his room reading
when he heard the fire alarmgo off.
"My RA came out and he said it
wasgoingtobealittlelonger,because
this one he said is real," Zweig said.
Because of a recent slew of false
alarms at West Quad, Zweig said he
thought this was just another false
alarm, and added he didn't smell
smoke in the dorm.
"I honestly thought it was a drill
because that's the way it's been
the past few times," Zweig said. "I
think somebody's been pulling the
fire alarm - but I'm not sure."
Since Feb. 1, West Quad has
experienced three false fire alarms.
LSA freshman Brad Kowalk
said he was starting to get annoyed
by the number of false alarms in
recent weeks. He added that last
week West Quad resident advisors
told students they were looking
into possible leads behind whoever
had been pulling the alarms.
Kowalk expressed concern that
his fellow West Quad residents
have stopped taking the recent
onslaught of alarms seriously.
"The more times people pull
the fire alarms, the less people
come out because they keep crying
wolf," he said.

Swanson contributed to this report
During Aren's preliminary
exam in December, the pros-
ecutor in the case, Karen Field
reduced the charge against Arens
from arson of personal property
to arson of real property exceed-
ing $20,000, arguing thatbecause
the building was abandoned at
the time of the fire it did not con-
stitute personal property.
Field also said Arens - who
authorities believe was homeless
at the time of the fire - frequent-
ly slept in the building and also
knew others who slept there but
ignored the potential hazard to
others when he set the fire.
At the same appearance in
December, Mullins requested
Arens' bond at the time be low-
ered from $100,000, noting that
his mother would be willing to
post a lower bond and take him to
her home.
Field objected based on Arens'
past criminal history and Judge
J. Simpson denied Mullins's
request, saying Arens could be
"detrimental to the safety of the
community."
Arens' co-defendant, Ian
Mackenzie, will be pleading not
guilty during his trial slated to be
held on May 10 before Judge Mor-
ris. Arens' trial date is scheduled
for June 21 at 8:30 a.m.

Revamping research
'U' must incorporate student innovation at NCRC
A s one of Michigan's three major research universi-
ties, the University of Michigan is known for its excel-
lence in research. And the new 30-building North
Campus Research Complex is the newest addition to the Uni-
versity's research efforts. As the University administration has
acknowledged, test tubes and pipettes alone can't offer an institu-
tion international recognition. Last week, administration officials
unveiled their vision for future research at the NCRC, which will
focus on combining a variety of fields like medicine, engineering
and pharmaceuticals to promote growth and innovation. Univer-
sity researchers should work together, but they should also take
advantage of the original ideas that students can provide.

was funded by the federal
government in the fiscal
year of 2009.

Get rea about the economy

Purchased from Pfizer for $108 million
last June, the more than 2 million-square-
foot NCRC will house administrative staff
and a diverse community of researchers.
According to a mass e-mail from Execu-
tive Vice President for Medical Affairs
and Health System CEO Dr. Ora Pescovitz,
the NCRC will be the testing ground of a
new research model that will emphasize
interdisciplinary research. The heart of
the new approach will be two technology
"anchors." One will focus on biointerfaces
and the other on medical imaging. These
anchors will be joined at the NCRC by
other, smaller interdisciplinary research
teams as well as currently separate groups
of health service researchers seeking to
make health care delivery more efficient
and accessible.
As recognized by the University, interdis-
ciplinary studies are the future of research.
Medical innovation, for instance, increas-
ingly requires a diverse team of medical
professionals and engineers to create tech-
nologies specifically designed to address
patients' needs. Such cross-discipline
coordination uses developments in nano-
technology and tissue engineering to com-
plement the work done by pharmacists and
the treatments being explored by clinicians.
This supportive research atmosphere rec-
ognizes that the best way to combat modern
challenges is to combine knowledge from a
variety of backgrounds.

The research explored under this model
will have important implications for the
poor economic condition of the state. A
recent study by the Anderson Economic
Group showed that the University Research
Corridor - a collaboration of Wayne State
University, Michigan State University and
the University of Michigan - contributed
to over $14 billion in economic benefit in
Michigan last year alone. Better methods
and more space will result in more fund-
ing that has an even greater impact on the
community and more importantly, the
state. Under the University's new research
model, this funding will be put to good use.
Yet as important as research is, the Uni-
versity shouldn't fail to take advantage
of the educational opportunities that the
NCRC affords. Student involvement in
research, from undergraduates to doctoral
candidates, is an integral component of an
educational experience at the University.
And students bring a fresh perspective and
innovative suggestions to research proj-
ects. This mutually beneficial relationship
gives the University an edge in research,
and University researchers should tap into
students' knowledge and ideas.
- The University's vision for research at
the NCRC is encouraging - cooperation
between researchers will lead to exciting
new developments. But to take advantage
of all its resources, University researchers
must use students' innovative spirit.

As a Daily columnist, .I've had
to get used to public criticism
of my opinions. When I write
about gay rights, for
instance, I expect
at least three angry
emails likening gay
marriage to polyg-
amy. And I'll admit
that I'm not always
a true expert on the
subjects on which I
write. But when it
comes to the econ- MATTHEW
omy, conservatives GREEN
have proven that
you don't need to
be an economist
to weigh in on the discussion. And,
though what I have to say will surely
rouse criticism from some readers, it's
time to get real about the economy.
The public debt currently stands at
just over $12.4 trillion, according to
the Bureau of Public Debt. That num-
ber takes into account the accumula-
tion of the national budget's yearly
deficits. Though people often correct-
ly cite surpluses under President Bill
Clinton, the overall public debt still
stood somewhere between $4 and 6
trillion under his administration, as a
sum of previous deficits. The debt he
left to his successor, President George
W. Bush, was $5.727 trillion.
Rather than slimming to a more
"conservative," budget, the day Presi-
dent George W. Bush left the White
House, he handed President Barack
Obama a debt of nearly $11 trillion.
Half of that was inherited, so I'll
ignore that. Of the other half, a small
fraction surely resulted from the
reduced tax revenue and increased
governmental precautions during
the recession. That may have been
unavoidable.
But Bush was adamant that slash-

ing taxes for the rich would create
trickle-down stimulus of the private
sector. So he .cut taxes, forcing the
government to deal with far less tax
revenue, effectively making it poorer.
Additionally, we entered into two
wars, which took a further toll on the
public pocketbook. Now Obama and
Congress must deal with all of the
above, which will cost a lot of money.
In addition, they have to focus on mas-
sive unemployment.
A basic measure proposed by
Democrats and widely supported by
economists is the stimulus package.
Congress passed one early last year at
a price of $787 billion. As a result, 2.4
million American jobs were saved or
created in 2009, accordingto the Con-
gressional Budget Office.
Yet conservatives say that spending
$787 billion was irresponsible when
the debt was already so large. But they
continue to support tax cuts, even
when the government is broke.
It may be confusing to understand
how spending can be a good thing
when the country has limited funds.
So think of it this way: the country is
like a college freshman in desperate
need of a student loan. In order to suc-
ceed in an increasingly competitive
global economy, that student needs
an education, but cannot pay for it by
himself. If he can't get a loan, he'll
have to quit school and work unsatis-
fying menial jobs for the restof his life.
But if he does get one, once he receives
his degree and gets a good paying job,
he'll be able to pay off his debt.
A stimulus package works just the
same way. Once it gets citizens back
on their feet, they pay the country
back by contributing to the GDP and
tax revenue. Though it adds to the
current public debt, it is unlike other
spending because it paves the way for
future government revenue.

And that brings me to my last point,
which may be the most controversial,
though it's probably the least complex.
Americans need to start paying more
taxes. There. I said it. Policymak-
ers and real economists will have to
decide whether these taxes are sales,
income, value-added or something
else. But the bottom line is that tax-
payers have been on a holiday that this
country can no longer afford. Pay-
ing higher taxes doesn't mean that
the country is, God, forbid, becoming
socialist. It just means that our coun-
try is hurting economically and it's
our civic duty to help out.
To balance debt,
Americans need to
paymore taxes.
So, to recap, we need more stimulus
and more taxes to get us out of the eco-
nomic mess we're in - which, it turns
out, was not Obama's fault. Yeah, I'm
trying to simplify things. And indeed,
I am unquestionably to the left - to a
fault, some will say. But ina sea of talk-
ing points and complex analyses, not to
mention populist conventions and con-
servative talk radio, the above points
are necessary to outline, even if I only
scratch the surface in this column.
But instead of barraging me with
attacks that I'm a just a dimwitted
liberal, if you're critical of what I've
said, I urge you to write a viewpoint
and submit it to the opinion page.
Bring it on.

Mledical Amnesty Actsaves out or injured person) does not become a health
tragedy. This bill is a matter of life and death
lives by reducing legal risk because, if not passed, it may not be reconsid-
ered until someone actually dies.

TO THE DAILY:
In his recent letter to the editor, Stephen
DeMare bases his opinion of the Medical Amnes-
ty Act on an ideal world that doesn't account
for the realities that exist on college campuses
throughout the United States and particularly
at the University (Medical Amnesty Act makes
irresponsibility acceptable, 02/17/2010). People at
this University consume alcohol in a safe man-
ner every night. Sometimes people do consume
too much, which is a risk we must prevent from
increasing. As a member of the Greek system, I
know that's one of the benefits of the sober moni-
tor system. It recognizes that people consume
alcohol at parties and tries toput the best meth-
ods in place to minimize alcohol-related risks.
As an EMT, I have seen first-hand why the
Medical Amnesty Act makes sense. Numerous
people I know have called me to tell me that
a friend passed out from drinking too much
and want to know if this friend needs to go to
a hospital. Sometimes my answer is that I've
consumed alcohol myself, so I can't legally give
that advice. This is incredibly difficult because
many of these intoxicated friends then have
two choices: do nothing and risk injury to the
passed out third-party friend or call for an
ambulance and risk an MIP.
This may sound like an easy choice, except
for the fact that intoxicated persons do not
think logically. That's why under state law
an intoxicated person cannot legally consent
or object to many things. Now consider if I'm
sober and go to see this passed out third-party.
If I say this person needs to go to a hospital, is
my intoxicated friend going to call an ambu-
lance or a taxi? When someone's pulse is 50 and
dropping the answer is obvious - but not to an
intoxicated person.
Consider a third option, though. Some peo-
ple may choose to illegally drive intoxicated to
bring their passed out friend to the hospital,
the worst of these three choices. The Medical
Amnesty Act providesprotection to minors
who bring a friend to the hospital to ensure
that someone who has a health risk (a passed

Last weekend, Democratic U.S.
Rep. John Dingell announced
his intention to run for a
28th term in the
U.S. House of
Representatives.
As the longest
serving House
member, Dingell
assumed office of
Michigan's 15th
Congressional
district, which
now includes Ann H
Arbor, in 1955.
That's the same KOSLOWSKI
year my parents
were born. Din-
gell replaced his
father, John Dingell Sr., who took
office in 1933, two years after my
grandma was born.
The 77-year Dingell family reign
in southeast Michigan politics dem-
onstrates something terribly wrong
in the way we elect our Congres-
sional leaders. Elected officials in
the legislative branch are allowed to
turn their stints in office into lifelong
careers. Political tenures that span
decades are one of the unhealthiest
influences in American politics. The
corruption, malaise and unfairness
they cause must be stopped through
the implementation of Congressional
term limits.
A February Gallup poll measured
Congressional job approval at 18
percent, a near record low. It's been
more than five years since Congress's
approval rating topped 50 percent.
Clearly, most Americans are fed up
with the body of government meant
to represent them. Rather than work-
ing together for the good of their con-
stituents, it's obvious to me that many
of our representatives are more con-
cerned about being reelected - but
who would blame them? With only
two-year terms, the U.S. House offers
very little job security unless repre-

sentatives are constantly planning
for the next election.
The House was structured to give
regular Americans the loudest voice
possible in Washington. It was sup-
posed to be a place where the "little
guy" could win office and ensure that
his or her district was properly rep-
resented. Well, if you wish the "little
guy" had less of a disadvantage in
winning a House seat, you should be
in favor of term limits.
It's no secret that incumbents have
obvious financial advantages in elec-
tions. Representatives enjoy salaries
of at least $174,000 a year. Each rep-
resentative has access to a federally
funded mail budget, often utilized
to send their constituents friendly
reminders of the politician's accom-
plishments in Washington. For many
representatives, it can top six figures
a year. Even in the sleepiest of dis-
tricts, it takes a huge chunk of change
to even consider a bid for Congres-
sional office. With their ex officio
benefits, many incumbents have an
advantage over their challengers.
If we capped representative tenure
at 10 years or fewer, we would ensure
a constant stream of new ideas into
Washington. Fresh voices would
help Congress's decisions more
closely reflect the will of the people.
The potential for corruption would
decrease because representatives
would have less time - and hopefully
less of a reason - to dabble in special
interest groups. Congresspersons
would have less incentive to make
careers from their elections and
instead have increased motivation to
make their mark on Washington in
the time they have.
Right now, the Congressional sys-
tem rewards career politicians. Only
those with several terms of expe-
rience can become party leaders,
Speaker of the House or leaders of
committees. I'll admit, I think some
experience is a good thing. I wouldn't

want the Speaker, who is third in
line to the Presidency, to be a first
term representative. But, I think the
amount of experience gained drops
off significantly after only a few
years. Does Dingell's 32 years of addi-
tional experience really make him a
better or more effective representa-
tive than House Speaker Nancy Pelo-
si (D-Calif.)? I don't think so.
Dingells' longevity
in Congress needs
to come to an end. 0

Term limits would diversify House
leaders, so newcomers would have
more of a chance to assume impor-
tant roles. Rather than the same old
guard holding the positions of power
year after year, newly elected repre-
sentatives would have more influ-
ence. Today, some small states with
fewer representatives rely on long-
serving officials to amplify their voic-
es in Congress. The establishment
of term limits wouldn't hurt these
states because many leadership posi-
tions would have to be filled by more
recently elected representatives.
Speaking to University Demo-
crats last Saturday, Dingell chastised
Wall Street for engaging in "greedy
behavior that sent our nation into
an economic tailspin." In the wan-
ing months of his latest term, Dingell
should take a serious look at his own
greed. Instead of seeking reelection,
Dingell should focus on enacting
Congressional term limits. After 55
years, isn't it time someone else had
a shot?

ly two thirds of the way through.
This single lull is an example of how
the film is a victim of its own effec-
tive pacing, because - up until this
point - we have been trained to
expect scenes from the past to last
only so long before we're thrust back
into the murky present. Yet this last
flashback takes 30 minutes because
it bridges the gap between past and
present. It makes sense, and perhaps
it's not meant to be anticipated, but it's
almost as unsettling as it is potent.
The film defies quick classification
because of the director's ambition.
This is not to say that films must fit
into a formulaic mold to be assessed
value within a certain genre. But
the narrative awkwardly bounces
between that of a story-told-out-of-
order like "Memento" to a complex
love-triangle to a confession about
the relationships between fathers and
sons to a near satire of actors and the
film industry itself to the story of how
a blind man went blind. If there were
less, it would all mean more.
It's as if Pedro Almoddvar - with
the creation of this film - wants
his name synonymous with its
own genre, a genre that, due to his
unquestionable talent and ambition,
he wants packed full of every dra-
matic tension known to man.

On the audio track there is a
robotic voice, emotionless, with
odd, synthetic turns of phrase
that make statements like "My
mother has died" into mechani-
cal articula-
tions rather
than emotive
accounts. In
the clip, the a
voice makes d
pointed state-
ments that, if
read, should
evoke human WHITNEY v
emotion, POW
but in audio
something is
lost in tran'slation: "Tyranny is
nothing new," the voice chimes,
"It's going to jump all over your
head and cock-a-doodle-doo."
The odd, Sylvia-Plath-like
rhymes are reminiscent of her
poem "Daddy." The voice, how-
ever, intones at the wrong vow-
els, extending the "ew" in "new"
into a strange sloping sound,
high to low, sounding closer to a
steam whistle than a voice.
The work is titled "Repugnant
Josephsons Chocolate" by Cecil
Touchon, published on Text-
sound.org, an online audio pub-
lication. Without the auditory
element of the work, one would
lose the disturbing mechanical
quality of lines like "Looking at a
picture of a dead 6-year-old" and
"children who blow themselves
up." The sound performance
adds crucial elements to this
piece that are not necessarily
palpable in reading the words
themselves without the element
of performance inherent in it.
The audio recording is a
somewhat overlooked medium in
which to work and perform art.
Many of these recorded pieces
are presented to the public in
audio installations in galleries
and museums, which, while
being a great venue for this kind
of art, has a limited audience
based on museum space and
location. The audio works, how-
ever, have recently found more
accessible outlets in online audio
publications, such as Textsound.
org, an online journal established
by at-some-point-Ann-Arbor-
based people including Anya
Cobbler, Adam Fagin, Anna
Vitale'ind Laura Wetherington.
Of the group, Anya and Laura are
both poets who graduated from

the University's MFA program.
I have had the privilege of
working with Textsound, help-
ing to turn the cogs in a local
sound-based art journal among
the ranks of other online jour-
nals that have found something
important in the value of per-
formed works of art in digital
media. Textsound has produced
eight issues of sound works and
published pieces by Pulitzer
Prize finalist Alice Notley as
well as University Professor and
sound poet Thylias Moss.
The process of gathering the
pieces for publication is a curato-
rial process, as mentioned on the
"About Us" for Issue 5, where
the online listening spaces in
Textsound function similarly
to a museum space in how they
preserves these works while pro-
viding user accessibility to them.
Here the definition of "exhibition
space" is stretched to incorporate
virtual spaces, where accessibil-
ity to the works of art is of pri-
mary importance. This all brings
into question what an "exhibit
space" is and how it functions
as more and more works of art
become digitized and available
for viewing or listening online.
In blurring the line between
online exhibit spaces and physi-
cal exhibit spaces, publications
like Textsound also blur and
meld the link between poetry
and sound and performance art.
The primary point of interest
is not necessarily the words or
sounds each by themselves, but
the way, when put together, both
complement one another.
For example, Professor Thy-
lias Moss's piece, "EnterRupted-
Sums" in Issue 2 is presented in
two versions. The first is a spo-
ken version with heavy reverb
and a droning, zombie-like
cadence as the artist performs
the lines aloud: "Let one offend
/This one defend." The second
version, however, begins with
an energetic percussive beat and
catchy synthesizer notes. When
the voice enters the recording,
there is a more singsong perfor-
mance of the lines and a jazzy
refrain of "A line forms" sung
behind them.
The words themselves have
not changed between the two
recordings, but the experience
arid effect of the words change
with the manner in which they

are performed - the spoken
version is almost chant-like,
imbuing a sense of foreboding
and isolation into the lines. The
music-accompanied version,
however, instills the piece with
a kind of rhythmic, pulsing
undertone, making the words
seem lighthearted in how the
music tones predominantly tie
the piece together. The idea
of performance affecting how
we experience words brings to
mind theater and how the way
words are intoned and presented
can change how we experience
certain lines themselves - the
sentence "Where were you" can
become a question with a rise
in tone to the end of the phrase;
accusatory with emphasis on
"were" and no tonal change.
Many of these performance
Collapsing

pieces play with sound and how
it affects the way we perceive
and understand language itself
And similarly, audio journals
like Textsound affect the way
we perceive exhibition space
and how art should or could be
presented to the public. Publica-
tions such as these use technol-
ogy to play with and deconstruct
the lines we see drawn between
"separate" genres and spaces
- virtual space versus physical
space as well as written word
versus performance art. Digital
spaces in particular allow us
to re-think definitions of what
something is and how this defini-
tion can be stretched to better fit
the accessibility of the Internet
and the collaborative nature of
digital sound. As we investigate
the meaning digital mediums can
imbue works of art and works
of poetry, we can see how jour-
nals like Textsound are moving
forward, utilizing contemporary
mediums as jumping points for
reinvestigating traditionally ana-
log forms of expression.

'16 and Pregnant' returns
with even worse parenting

A drunken delight

By CHRISTINA ANGER
DailyArts Writer
"If you don't shut up, I'll just leave
and you'll never see me again." Most
likely, this sentence conjures up fond
memories of those
jaded teenage years
when contemptu-
ous threats to par- 16 and
ents who just didn't
understand were Pregnant
another part of Tuesdays
daily life. But this is
MTV, so there must
be some additional MTV
element of drama
for any otherwise relatable experi-
ence. And this time, the quote came
out of the mouth of a teen mom.
Back for its second season, because
apparently the first didn't scare
. enough teens into celibacy, "16 and
Pregnant' sums up nine months
of confusion, ill-preparedness and
demands for paternity tests in each
hour-long episode. The show's first
season centered around strong teen-
aged girls who decided to birth their
babies as the whole world watched
them grow, both physically and as
more mature mothers.
Admittedly, season one was ... cute.
Sure, teenaged pregnancy is hard -
but those babies! And if some girl on
MTV can do it, and probably get a nice
lump of cash, so can any whats-her-
name in Anywhere, USA.
This time around, it's no longer
sufficient just to be pregnant, but one
must also exhibit the qualities of a
horrible mother.
Jenelle is the show's bait for its sec-
ond season. She seemed OK at first,
a bit heavy on the attitude, but that's
ascribable to hormones. That is until
Jace comes along, stuck in daycare
while Jenelle returns to high school.
He's watched by his grandma when

That's gonna be one sassy baby.
Jenelle needs to "get out."
Sympathy and concern for Jenelle's
baby are what make this season's pre-
miere worth watching. More often
than not, Jace is referred to as "it,"
and well into his first few months, his
mother still seems to be toying with
the idea of actually raisinghim.
When babies are
better off
with grandma.
If this entire season follows the low
motherly bar set by Jenelle, MTV's
show is going to make a few state-
ments distinct from its first season.
Instead of displaying the hardships
of the teen mom, season two seems
to focus on how much it would suck
to be the baby - providing a differ-
ent point of view to deter teen moms
from thinking they can handle the
pressure.
And Jenelle is a prime example
of how much a teen mom loses, like,
you know, partying with friends, "me

time" and going to the beach. Jenelle
prides herself on how she takes care
of herself, while everyone else is only
noticing how she doesn't take care of
her baby. When her mom reminds her
to fill a few bottles, she whines, "Are
you serious?"
While the season premiere is a
bit difficult to watch, and even more
annoying to listen to courtesy of Jen-
elle's constant whining (to be noted,
more than her baby), it provides a
more realistic look into how teen
pregnancy isn't just learning to work
life around a baby. It isn't just being
able to tell mom before the bump
comes or making the baby daddy put
a ring on -it. It's living at home with
mom and dad and it means no more
being a kid.
Moms from last season pulled up
their britches, stuck out their bellies
and took the role of mom head-on.
Jenelle threatens to run away and
leave her baby with grandma. But
honestly, if the camera portrays her
mothering accurately, that may not
be the worst thing. Hopefully teens
will get the message, or their tacky
threats might not mean much. And
what's a teen without a contemptu-
ous mouth?

hearing Joan-

goes nicely
with a flapper dress, a feather
in the hair and lounging on a
velvet couch with a bottle of
scotch.
It has been four years since
Newsom's last album, 2006's
Ys, and Have One assures lis-
teners that it was worth the
wait. Comprised of more than
two hours of gorgeous vocals,
chilling harp riffs and play-
ful piano parts - all played by
the California native - the sul-
try and sweet songstress takes
us to a twisted time of cabaret
with bluesy vocals, jazz and
liquor.
Have One On Me opens with
"Easy," a beautiful and bluesy
six-minute song that sets the
album's tone with jazz flute,
horns, haunting harps and ori-
ental staccato vocals.
The standout on the record is
the Dusty Springfield-inspired
"Good Intentions Paving Com-
pany. Newsom takes the lis-
tener on a dragged-out night
drive with a frustratedlover as
she croons: "And the tilt of this
strange nation / And the will to
remain for the duration / Wav-
ing the flag, feeling it drag."
The song ends with a minute's
worth of eloquently beautiful,
locomotive harmonies and a
horn solo, truly emphasizing
the old-time cabaret sound.
For all the jazzy accompa-
niment, the strength of the
album lies with Newsom's
vocals. Although Newsom is an

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com
Legislation that took effect yesterday
t will place restrictions on credit cards

From Page 1
"If you look at the way we're
compensated, the number of
accounts that are opened, the
royalties that are generated, the
legislation doesn't really affect
the program," he said.
The Alumni Association has
partnered with Bank of America
since 1991, according to Sigler.
Currently, the two entities have a
10-year, $25 million contract that
began in 2004, according to the
contract between the partners.
According to Sigler, there are
approximately 75,000 accounts
open under the contract, 400 of
which belong to students.
Betty Riess, senior vice presi-
dent in corporate communi-
cations of Bank of America,
said student accounts generate
roughly two percent of the rev-
enue derived from the program
and that Bank of America and
the Alumni Association have not
marketed on campus in roughly
two years.
"We've been in compliance

with the laws for a while," she
said. "Our program has always
been targeted at non-students,
and this just focuses that a little
more."
The law, which was wide-
ly supported in Congress but
opposed by many banks, will also
make it mandatory for compa-
nies to notify account holders of
rising interest rates and spending
limits at least 45 days in advance.
It will also allow cardholders
to pay offtheir highest debts first,
which could be especially helpful
to college students, according to
Christine Lindstrom, director of
the Education Project on Debt
conducted by the United States
Public Interest Research Groups.
Lindstrom said the legislation
could be "huge and very signifi-
cant" for decreasing debt.
"By giving the cardholder
some ability to proactively fix
the problems that they had, to
get out from underneath the pen-
alty interest rate, you can lower
the debt that that person would
otherwise face," Lindstrum said

in an interview with the Daily in
September.
Though he said the Alumni
Association's relationship with
the bank doesn't stand to suffer
from the new laws, Sigler said
he thinks the legislation should
have focused more on educating
young consumers than sheltering
them.
"Having a credit card is as
much a part of the education-
al experience, the maturation
process of going to college and
being independent as anything
else," he said. "To put that bar-
rier in place does more of a dis-
service to younger people than
help them."
Credit card companies have
also warned that the laws will
drive up prices and limit credit
card availability when the coun-
try's economy needs spending.
School of Education junior
Elizabeth Miller said she's happy
about the new rules because
the age requirement could help
younger credit card applicants
avoid debt in the first place.

"I think it's good, because
when you're just starting in col-
lege and you're on your own,
you're likely to spend too much
money and get way too far into
debt," she said. "But maybe 21 is
a little late."
But School of Education junior
Stacey Weizeorick said that she
thinks not all students need to
have their financial behavior
regulated by the government or
supervised by their parents.
"I think it'll be helpful to
some, but like a lot of other age
requirements, I don't think it
should necessarily be a law for
everybody," she said.
LSA sophomore Laura King,
said she thinks think the age
requirement is unfairly inconsis-
tent with other federal laws.
"You can vote, you can go to
war, you can decide if you want
to get married, everything except
drinking," King said. "At 18,
you're technically an adult with
a lot of legal responsibilities, and
managing your money should be
one of them."

tions.
"With that kind of change, as
many relationships as we can start
early - in other words, before they
even take office - the better," she
said.
Wilbanks also discussed the
state's budget for next year, focus-
ing on diminishing state funds and
the revamped Michigan Promise
Scholarship. Michigan Gov. Jen-
nifer Granholm recently proposed
bringing the Michigan Promise
Scholarship back as a tax credit for
students who commit to staying
in Michigan for a year following
graduation instead of a merit-based
scholarship.
In addition, Wilbanks talked
about proposed legislation that
if passed, would allow students
to carry concealed weapons on
campus. The proposed bill would
a override University policy that
bans weapons on campus, but it
would not supercede state law ban-
ning concealed weapons in resi-
dence halls, classrooms and arenas.
"We were able to slow down the
bill that would have eliminated the
regents ability to make decisions
about the safety of the campus
with respect to carrying concealed
weapons," Wilbanks said. "The
bill is still pending in the (state),
House and could be taken up at
any moment by the committee that
originally was looking at an entire
package of bills related to liberaliz-
ing gun laws."
PESCOVITZ DISCUSSES
FUTURE OF UMHS, NCRC
Executive Vice President for
Medical Affairs Ora Pescovitz also
spoke at yesterday's Senate Assem-
bly meeting and discussed the
future of the University of Michi-
gan Health System.
Pescovitz emphasized UMHS's
sizeable impact on campus, noting
that it comprises about one half of

Tuesday, February 23, 2010 - 7
the University in terms of money,
space and staff.
Pescovitz said when she was
transitioning to the University
about nine months ago, UMHS's
finances were not as secure as they
are now. She said foresight and
planning by UMHS management
before she arrived reduced expens-
es for the system.
"Our finances have stabilized,"
Pescovitz said.
Pescovitz said UMHS is grow-
ing in the number of people it will
be able to serve. In addition to
the opening of the North Campus
Research Complex - which UMHS
owns - UMHS is increasing the
number of hospital beds
Aside from the North Campus
Research Complex, which Pesco-
vitz discussed in detail, UMHS is
growing in terms of number of peo-
ple they will be able to serve. With
the new C.S. Motts Children's and
Von Voightlander Women's Hospi-
tal the number of licensed beds will
increase.
Pescovitz also outlined her main
goals for the future of UMHS.
"When we look at the future of
the health system we say that we
are creating the future of heath
care through discovery," she said.
In addition to this goal, Pesco-
vitz said she would like for the Uni-
versity to become a leader in health
care, health reform, biomedical
innovation and medical and nurs-
ing education.
According to Pescovitz, UMHS is
"knee deep" in a strategic planning
process which was put into effect
last September to help advance
these goals.
Pescovitz also discussed the
NCRC, saying she was very excited
about the potential of the complex
to "really do unprecedented things
to solve humankind's problems with
respect to solutions to problems that
have neverbeensolved before."
She added that she hopes when
the NCRC is fully functional, it will
play a very large role in changing
the economy locally, statewide and
regionally.

Davis has filed similar lawsuits before

From Page 1
all applicable laws and hold itself
to the same high standards it holds
its students to.
"It's very important for public
bodies to be open and to adhere
to the same legal regulations that
they hold student-athletes to, like
the NCAA regulations," Davis said.
Davis said he tried to attend
the private, hastily-called regents
meeting, but was not permitted to
do so.
"I had gone to the meeting on
Feb. 3 and had been denied entry
and had requested meeting min-
utes and was denied that," Davis
said. "There comes a point where
the law must be upheld."
Davis said he hopes his lawsuit
will encourage administrators to
publicly release the minutes from
the Feb. 3 meeting, to hold discus-
sions on the NCAA investigation in
an open meeting and ensure that a

similar event doesn't happen again
in the future.
However, University officials
have maintained no minutes exist
for the meeting, a claim that Davis
said he does not believe.
"Every elementary law student
or elementary student knows that
any meeting of a public body must
have (minutes)," he said.
In an interview last night,
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham said it would be pre-
mature for her to comment on the
lawsuit, since the University has
yet to be officially served.
However, last week Cunning-
ham told the Daily she believed the
University had acted appropriately
when it held the private regents
meeting at the beginning of Febru-
ary.
One of Davis's attorneys, Aina
Watkins said this isn't the first
time Davis has brought a suit like
this, noting that he has filed sever-

al suits regarding the Open Meet-
ings Act in the past.
"He just believes that pub-
lic bodies need to keep the pub-
lit informed about the decisions
that they make regarding public
employees or students, or things
of that sort," she said. "That's his
motivation, from me knowing
him."
It remains unclear what will
happen with the case, but Watkins
told the Daily yesterday the Uni-
versity may want to settle the case
because of the attention it has been
receiving.
"It's a big case and I think
because of the national attention,
the fact that this investigation has
been going on since the summer,
they may want to settle," Watkins
said. "ButI have no idea because I
haven't spoken to anyone."
Davis said he will continue to
pursue the issue, but admitted the
University's legal resources may

put a strain on his ability to persist
in the case.
"We're going to treat this as a
full-fledged case and in the com-
ing days we'll see how committed
I am," Davis said.
The NCAA's investigation into
the Michigan football program
was launched on Oct. 23, when
NCAA Vice President for Enforce-
ment David Price sent a letter of
inquiry to Coleman.
In the letter Price said he
planned to complete the investiga-
tion by Dec. 31, 2009, but said the
date was not a formal deadline.
The allegations against the
Michigan football team were first
brought fourth in an August 2009
report published in the Detroit
Free Press. At the time, the Univer-
sitylaunched an internalinvestiga-
tion into the situation. University
officials have not released any new
information regarding the internal
investigation.

Blue will look to
Morris to stop
leading scorer
Demetri McCamey
By CHRIS MESZAROS
Daily Sports Editor
Coming off a particularly dis-
heartening contest against Penn
State on Saturday, dropping their
record to 13-13 overall, the Wol-
verines enter a
tough final four Iljlnojs at
games, starting Mihia
tonight with a
contest against Matchup:
a surging Illi- Michigan
nois team that is 13-13; lli-
lookingto securen
an at-large bid in When: Tonight
the NCAA Tour- 7 p.m.
nament. Where:
One key Crisler Arena
matchup will be TV/Radio:
between fresh- ESPN
man Darius Mor-
ris's defense and Illinois's leading
scorer, guard Demetri McCamey,
who leads the Fighting Illini (9-5
Big Ten, 17-10 overall) with 15.2
points per game.
"Because he is 6-3, he sees over
people," Michigan coach John
Beilein said of McCamey during
yesterday's Big Ten teleconfer-
ence. "I remember the first time
I saw him play as a freshman, he
just could see over everybody and
pass. His shooting and shooting
off the dribble was just develop-
ing. But now he could pass, he
could shoot and he has the mid-
range."
Although McCamey provides
the freshman with another chal-
lenge, Morris held Penn State's
Talor Battle in check when given
the opportunity last Saturday.
In the final seven minutes, when
Morris finally came off the bench
to provide defensive relief, Battle
and the Nittany Lions were held-

scoreless until 14 seconds left in
the game.
Before Morris entered the
contest, Penn State tore apart
the Wolverines' defense, scor-
ing 34 points in the paint, many
of which came in the second half
off of dribble penetration from
Battle and assists to wide-open
forwards in the paint. Without
Morris on the floor, Michigan
didn't have the speed to match
both Battle and Penn State guard
Tim Frazier. The two combined
to extend the Nittany Lions' lead
to nine with 7:53 to play in the
contest.
"Sometimes one of the guards
would get in there and we were
forced to help," Morris said. "And
that caused the other help man
that was guarding Battle or Babb,
because they're such great three-
point shooters, a little slow on
the rotation down there on the
block and they were getting easy
layups."
Although McCamey doesn't
possess Battle's speed, he will
once again posea threat from the
perimeter, which Michigan has
struggled to stop. And though
McCamey scored just six points
in Illinois's 75-65 loss to No. 4
Purdue last Saturday, the guard
tallied 16 assists, tying him for
fourth all time in Big Ten history
for a single game.
"He's not as quick as Battle -
few are," Beilein said. "But he's
got a big body, so he's able to
get leverage on people not just
using speed, but his body, and he
can see over the top of screens
because of his great vision and
court awareness."
None of those attributes bode
well for Michigan. And with
7-foot-1 center Mike Tisdale -
who tore up Michigan last season
with 24 points at Assembly Hall
- and 6-foot-9 forward Mike
Davis, tomorrow's matchup could
be even uglier for the Wolverines.
But Morris's performance
could be paramount. All season,

In Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth's first season at the helm of the
Wolverines in 2007-08, the Michi-
gan women's basketball team made
an unexpected run to qualify for
the Women's National Invitation
Tournament.
Two years later, with a grander
goal - an
NCAA Tourna- A
ment bid - and ALEX
even lesser HERMANN
expectations On Women's
- the team Basketball
was picked to
finish last in
the Big Ten preseason by both the
media and coaches - this season's
Wolverines hoped to make an even
bigger splash.
But following Sunday's 73-61
loss to Wisconsin, that dream may
have been shattered.
The loss dropped Michigan to
6-10 in the conference and 14-12
overall. The Wolverines have
fallen to eighth place ina confer-
ence that sent five teams to The
Big Dance a year ago. And with
two games left before the Big Ten
Tournament, the team has no
chance of even finishing .500 in
conference play.
"We don't necessarily sit down
and say ... 'We wantto win 20
games or we want to finish first
place in the conference,"' Michi-
gan coach Kevin Borseth said at
Big Ten Media Day prior to the
season. "I just think there are
goals inside you every year that
tell you, you want to get into the
NCAA Tournament. I think that's
what every program wants to do."
But barring an unlikely run in
the conference tournament, that
hope won't be realized.
Still, Michigan has plenty to
play for. Though the Wolverines

may not accomplish their ultimate
goal, they are in a good position
to qualify for the WNIT, which
would serve as more than just a
consolation prize for ateam with
six freshmen.
A WNIT berth would also
reward seniors Krista Phillips and
Kalyn McPherson with a few more
games in their college careers.
Of course, the Wolverines still
have some work to do, and looking
too far ahead won't do any good as
the regular season comes to a close.
The 2007 WNIT team finished
9-9 in the conference, 16-12 overall
and added a win in the Big Ten
Tournament.
A year ago, Indiana and Wiscon-
sin went to the WNIT out of the
Big Ten. The Hoosiers had finished
11-7 in the conference, while the
Badgers finished with a meager
6-12 record, but made it to the
semifinals of the Big Ten Tourna-
ment.
Michigan, already in good
position record-wise, has several
advantages over the WNIT teams
from three years ago.
The national perception of the
Big Ten has improved since three
teams advanced to the Sweet 16 of
the NCAA Tournament a year ago.
This year's Michigan team also put
together an impressive nonconfer-
ence slate, including a win atthen-
No.8 Xavier.
For the Wolverines, a strong
enough finish to make those post-
season aspirations a reality would
include winning at Minnesota and
beating Purdue in the regular sea-
son finale.
And should theteam still hold its
preseason dreams of playing in The
Big Dance, three or four wins in
the Big Ten Tournament wouldn't
hurt much, either.

Freshman Darius Morris, pictured here, was able to shut down Penn State's star
guard Talor Battle in the Wolverines' loss this past weekend to the Nittany Lions.

the Wolverines' shooting has
been streaky at best and coma-
tose at worst. But with Mor-
ris's speed at the top of the 1-3-1
zone or guarding the point guard
in man defense, Michigan can
potentially slow down the versa-
tility of the Fighting Illini.
Wit the Wolverines looking
to refocus after Saturday's dis-
appointing loss, it will become

harder and harder to avoid sim-
ply looking toward next season.
"I don't think there's any issue
with refocusing," Beilein said.
"The opponent I do not believe
is ourselves as much as it is Illi-
nois. We've got to regroup and
get better. That's what our main
focus is, getting better. Whether
it pays off this year or next year,
it's going to pay off."

a bye to the quarterfinals - but it
wasn't on the same level as the Unit-

too. United States goalie Ryan Mill-

for Michigan State, made 42 saves,
while Ohio State hockey alum Ryan

Sunday's game may not be as

it the best hockey game he's ever
