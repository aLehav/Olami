In campus-wide 
e-mail, Schlissel 

outlines preventative 
measures at UM-Flint

By TANYA MADAHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

In an e-mail to the University 

community Monday, University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

commended 
the 
efforts 
of 

UM-Flint Chancellor Sue Borrego 
to 
combat 
lead-contaminated 

drinking water on the Flint 
campus amid the ongoing water 
crisis in the city.

“Their 
considerable 
efforts 

began more than a year ago, and 
because of their actions, drinking 
water on the campus is safe,” 
Schlissel wrote. “This is a long-
term crisis for one of our state’s 
most important cities and its 
people. The strong ties (Borrego) 
has built with the community 
will be needed more than ever.”

In a November 2015 statement 

to The Michigan Daily, Borrego 
said 
the 
Flint 
campus 
has 

implemented multiple initiatives 
in an effort to provide safe water 
on its campus.

According 
to 
Borrogo, 

although the campus itself was 
not required to start filtering and 
boiling their water at that time, 
all drinking water fountains, 
break 
room 
sinks, 
kitchen 

sinks and food prep areas were 
installed with filtration devices. 
Faucet mounted filters were fitted 
for students living on campus in 
residences halls, as well as those 
living off campus.

In a November 2015 e-mail 

to 
The 
Michigan 
Daily, 

Marjory 
Wisniewski, 
senior 

advisor for media relations and 
communications for the Flint 
campus, wrote that Borrego 
drove the measures to improve 
water quality.

“Borrego took the stance that 

our campus must go beyond the 
federal guidelines to ensure we 
protect students, faculty and staff 
from any and all lead exposure 
and to provide peace of mind 
by installing filters throughout 
campus,” Wisniewski wrote.

Borrego noted in her statement 

that while the water emergency is 
not expected to subside anytime 
soon, resources from all three 
campuses are being provided 
to the Flint student, faculty, 
and staff community, and Flint 

Researchers 

attribute decrease 
to apathy, increase 

in vehicle costs

By AMANDA DELETKA

For the Daily

Though it may come as 

surprise to commuters who 
driving 
bumper-to-bumper 

traffic on State Street some 
mornings, the number of people 
receiving their driver’s license in 
the United States is decreasing 
each year, according to research 
conducted by the University of 
Michigan Transport Research 
Institute.

The 
study, 
which 
was 

published earlier this month, 
shows that the number of 19 
year-olds becoming licensed to 
drive has decreased 18 percent 
from 1983 to 2014

Michael Sivak and Brandon 

Schoettle, who are UMTRI 
research scientists, attributed 
the 
decrease 
to 
increasing 

costs associated with driving 
and a stronger environmental 
conscious, but ultimately boils 
down to an apathetic generation.

Michigan State University 

junior Paige McKeon said she 
waited until she was 19 before 
becoming licensed to drive.

“I was lazy and it was not 

necessary.” McKeon said. “I 

Attendees share 
anecdotes about 

grappling with anti-
Muslim prejudice 

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

The words “Move to your 

homeland” appeared on the 
screen at the front of the 

Pendleton Room Monday night.

The phrase, serving as one 

example of a negative comment 
aimed at the Muslim community 
on campus, was part of the 
School of Literature, Science 
and the Arts sponsored event 
Sharing 
Stories, 
Building 

Allyhood: 
Student 
Voices 

Against Islamophobia, which 
drew hundreds of students and 
faculty to the Union Monday 
night.

The event’s emcee, American 

Culture Prof. Evelyn Alsultany, 
who is also the director of Arab 
and Muslim American Studies, 
said she wanted to demonstrate 
how Islamophobia affects the 
University 
community 
and 

prompt thinking about how to 
create a campus environment 
that is inclusive of all people.

“Islamophobia has been a 

problem in our country for 
a very long time,” Alsutany 
said. “Recently there has been 
an increase in Islamophobia, 

(meaning) hate crimes against 
Muslims 
and 
people 
who 

are perceived to be Muslims, 
discourses 
by 
presidential 

candidates and other people 
that 
perceive 
Muslims 
as 

un-American or anti-American 
and not part of this country and, 
in general, a way of thinking 
about Muslims — a logic that 
justifies their exclusion.”

During the event, students 

spoke in front of dozens of 

‘Michigan App’ will 
now send emergency 
messages through 
push notifications 

By SEAN DEW

For the Daily

The University is set to unveil 

another way to stay connected 
to its emergency alert system 
sometime this semester.

Beginning Dec. 4, Michigan’s 

Department 
of 
Information 

and Technology Services began 
testing a way for students to 
receive emergency alerts via 
push notifications from the 
University’s 
official 
mobile 

application, the Michigan App.

The 
notifications 
would 

supplement 
the 
University’s 

already established system for 
distributing emergency alerts, 
which includes text messages, 
voicemail, 
e-mail, 
digital 

signage, the University website 
and Twitter.

The update would also allow 

non-Michigan 
community 

members, such as parents or 
University 
contractors, 
to 

stay informed of potentially 
threatening 
situations 
as 

well, as long as they have 
downloaded 
the 
application 

and enabled push notifications.

During the testing process, 

ITS researchers sent surveys 
to more than 4,000 University 

students, 
staff 
and 
faculty 

seeking 
feedback 
about 

the 
effectiveness 
of 
push 

notifications on the application.

In 
an 
interview, 
Diane 

Brown, 
spokeswoman 
for 

the University’s Division of 
Public Safety and Security, 
said the surveys showed push 
notifications 
were 
reaching 

University 
community 

members quickly.

“With initial testing, it was 

discovered that at many times 
the push notifications would 
reach recipients faster than 
texts,” she said.

In 
a 
statement, 
Scott 

Taylor, 
executive 
director 

of ITS Solution Design and 
Delivery and interim executive 
director of ITS Application and 
Information Services, said he 
believes the surveys will help 
further improve the system. 

“We 
are 
continuing 
to 

refine our systems to send 
texts, 
e-mails 
and 
voice 

alerts out faster than ever,” 
he said. “The Michigan App 
push alert mechanism needs 
some adjustments to increase 
reliability for emergency alerts.”

Brown 
said 
one 
of 
the 

main 
obstacles 
facing 
the 

ITS department to create the 
feature was accounting for 
the 
formatting 
differences 

between Android and Apple 
operating systems.

there was a difference in

Topics ranging from the 

bicentennial 
anniversary 
of 

the University, the Flint water 
crisis and diversity initiative 
were on University President 
Mark Schlissel’s mind when he 
came to speak at the University 
Senate Assembly Monday.

Starting with the upcoming 

bicentennial in 2017, Schlissel 

said the University is one of 
few universities who have the 
opportunity to celebrate 200 
years.

“We’re really a pillar of 

society 
and 
that’s 
pretty 

exciting 
to 
think 
about,” 

Schlissel said. “A team has been 
planning a year or more’s worth 
of activities to commemorate 
our 200th, and probably more 
importantly to look together to 
what the University is going to 
be in the years ahead.”

Schlissel 
said 
he 
has 

appointed 
faculty 
members 

to 
separate 
committees 
to 

organize 
three 
colloquiums 

celebrating 
the 
University’s 

bicentennial throughout the 
year. The colloquiums will each 

focus on a different aspect of 
the University’s future and 
involvement in the greater 
community.

Taking on a topic that 

has garnered statewide and 
national 
media 
attention 

and outrage, Schlissel also 
spoke about the Flint water 
crisis, 
highlighting 
efforts 

the University’s Flint campus 
has been making to provide 
support for their community. 
He said in addition to installing 
its own water filter in 2015, 
the Flint campus has been 
testing its water since fall 
2014 and uses an independent 
water-testing 
laboratory 
to 

ensure water safety. Schlissel

Christopher Hill 
explores political 
strategies in Syria 
and North Korea

By CALEB CHADWELL

Daily Staff Reporter

Christopher Hill, former 

assistant secretary of state and 
U.S. ambassador, discussed 
current 
topics 
in 
foreign 

policy, such as ongoing peace 
settlements for conflicts in 
Syria and North Korea, at the 
Ford School of Public Policy 
Monday evening.

Hill 
was 
nominated 

as 
an 
ambassador 
by 

three 
presidents, 
most 

recently serving as the U.S. 
ambassador 
to 
Iraq 
from 

2009 to 2010. He also helped 

bring an end to the Bosnian 
War 
through 
the 
Dayton 

Accords peace agreement in 
1995, an agreement which he 
said could be applicabble to 
current global conflict.

While Hill noted it was 

not a complete success in 
helping bring about political 
change, he said he’s proud of 
the Accords in helping to end 
a violent and horrific conflict.

“There 
were 
200,000 

people killed in the Balkans, 
there were rape camps and all 
kinds of hideous things that 
had to be stopped,” Hill said.

Speaking to to ongoing 

situations with Syria, North 
Korea, China and Iran today, 
he said there were parallel 
that could be drawn.

Hill said after negotiating 

an 
end 
to 
the 
Bosnian 

conflict, he learned that a 
key to reaching agreements 

is a willingness to work and 
negotiate with all different 
parties involved. He added 
that though it’s not always 
fun, to reach peace conflicting 
parties 
must 
communicate 

with each other.

Touching 
on 
his 

experiences serving as the 
U.S. ambassador to South 
Korea and assistant secretary 
of state, Hill said though 
North Korea was one of the 
most difficult countries he 
dealt with as a diplomat, he 
thought the United States 
still needed to attempt to 
make agreements with the 
country.

“These are people only 

a mother can love; I have 
never had such an unpleasant 
experience as I did with 
North Korea,” Hill said.

He added that while over 

half of the people in the 

Republican 
Party 
today 

refuse to negotiate with 
North Korea, he commends 
former President George 
W. Bush for opening up 
diplomatic relations with 
them during his tenure.

Nuclear weapons, Hill 

said, is the biggest challenge 
for U.S. diplomacy today. 

“Look 
at 
Hiroshima, 

could we handle another 
Hiroshima in this world? 
I don’t think so,” Hill 
said. “I think the issue is 
how to stop these nuclear 
wannabes.”

China could play a role in 

putting pressure on North 
Korea and their nuclear 
program, 
Hill 
noted. 

However, he stressed that 
the United States needs 

to be more transparent with 
China for them to consider 
potentially imposing heavier 
sanctions 
against 
North 

Korea.

Speaking to the current 

civil war in Syria involving 
President Bashar al-Assad, 
the rebels and ISIS, Hill 
cautioned 
the 
audience 

against 
harshly 
criticizing 

people 
working 
to 
obtain 

peace in the country.

“I think Syria is a hideous 

situation, 
probably 
even 

worse than Bosnia was,” Hill 
said. “It’s easy to be critical of 
the people working on it, but 
you’ve got to understand the 
degree of difficulty that they 
have to contend with.”

Hill stressed the need for 

the political parties of the 
United States to pull together 
and propose a bipartisan plan 
to reach peace in Syria.

When asked his opinion 

on the recently implemented 
nuclear deal with Iran, Hill 
said while the deal does limit 
Iran’s nuclear capability, it 
also unfreezes Iranian assets 
that they could use to support 
terrorist organizations such 
as Hezbollah.

In closing, Hill talked about 

how enjoyable and fulfilling it 
was to serve as a diplomat, and 
encouraged students not to be 
afraid of pursuing a career 
with the State Department. 

“There’s 
no 
country 
in 

the world that’s more fun 
to defend than the United 
States,” Hill said. “American 
diplomacy 
should 
be 

something that we do, and do 
very well.”

Public 
Policy 
senior 

Madeline Hartlieb said she 
attended the talk because she 
is interested in foreign policy 

and pursuing diplomacy in 
the future.

“Just to hear how outspoken 

(Hill) was, especially given 
how morbid the foreign policy 
scene can seem — I would 
definitely say that it was 
inspiring,” Hartlieb said.

Public Policy junior Swathi 

Shanmugasundaram 
said 

she 
enjoyed 
hearing 
Hill 

speak because of his career 
experience 
and 
her 
own 

interest in foreign policy.

“It’s easy to get down on 

yourself 
and 
your 
career 

path, 
especially 
as 
an 

undergraduate student and 
seeing everyone pass you,” 
Shanmugasundaram 
said. 

“But to hear Ambassador Hill 
talk about how his career 
started and how it’s flourished 
is 
awesome, 
because 
you 

think ‘Wow, maybe I can do 
that too.’”

Mike’s dream to work for Ellen

KRISTINA PERKINS/Daily

Haloti Ngata, defensive tackle for the Detroit Lions, participates in a dialogue 

about student athletes at the Trotter Multicultural Center on Monday. The 

discussion followed a screening of the PBS documentary In Football We Trust and 

focused on the pressures athletes face as they juggle sports, school, and family.

TACKLE AT TROT TE R

LSA sophomore Michael 
Funkhouser recently 
created a video resume of 
his achievements, posted 
on Facebook, in hopes 
of getting a summer 
internship on “The Ellen 
DeGeneres Show.” 

Could you describe your 
video and why you made 
it?

I made a video to try and 
be an intern for Ellen. I’ve 
taken some videos in the 
last couple of years, and 
there were some videos 
from news stations. I 
thought it would be really 
cool to go back through 
those and relive all of that. 
So I was like, “Oh, I could 
make a really cool video 

compiling all of those 
together.” I just wanted to 
have fun with it and try 
and get her attention.

Why Ellen? What do 
you hope to get out of an 
internship with her?

I actually get asked the 
“Why Ellen?” question a 
lot. My answer is always 
that I could have tried to 
get an internship with 
anyone. The issue would 
have been whether I was 
working here in Ann 
Arbor, back in Jackson 
where I’m from, or 
New York or L.A., I’d 
eventually be sitting at a 
desk wherever I was, and 
I’d say, “I want to go help 
people.” And there was 

a chance that whatever 
boss I’d have, I’d have to 
explain why. If I work 
for Ellen, I don’t have to 
explain why. She just says, 
or hopefully she says, 
“How can I help you do 
that?” which would be 
really cool.

Why did you decide to 
go about this over social 
media?

Social media is what I 
know. It’s honestly one 
of the only ways to do it. 
I don’t know how else 
I would have done it. I 
applied online, on her 
website.

Rodents and mold 
found during 
Detroit schools 
inspection

The City of Detroit conducted 

inspections of 11 public schools as 
a part of distrinct-wide review this 
week. The inspections revealed 
multiple code violations including 
reports of mold, damaged roofs, 
rodents and broken glass. 

The district review is part of a 

response to recent mass sick-out 
protests by local teachers in protest 
of the building conditions within 
the school districts. The sick-outs 
have resulted in school closings 
and have left students without 
school-provided meals. 

The Detroit Public Schools’ 

buildings have been deteriorating 
over time as the district has been 
unable to pay for repairs. The 
district’s debt currently stands at 
an estimated $515 million. 

City inspectors found a total 

of 152 violations with each school 
averaging at 14 violations. With 
these discoveries, each school has 
approximately a month to make 
repairs. 

Mayor Mike Duggan called for 

the inspections on Jan. 13 after 
seeing first hand the conditions of 
four different schools.

Former Detroit FBI 
chief to help in Flint 
water investigation

Andrew Arena, former director 

of the Detroit FBI office, has been 
appointed by Michigan Attorney 
General Bill Schuette as part of 
the team investigating the lead 
contamination of Flint’s drinking 
water.

The water supply in Flint was 

contaminated with lead beginning 
in April 2014, following a switch 
from the Detroit city water supply 
to Flint River water. Since the 
change, residents have reported 
negative health effects including 
hair loss and rotting teeth.

The investigation will examine 

various public officials for 
offences related to misfeasance or 
malfeasance. 

In addition to Arena — who 

now heads the Detroit Crime 
Commission — Ellis Stafford, 
his deputy at the Detroit Crime 
Commission, will also be assisting 
with the investigation. Stafford is a 
Flint native and former Michigan 
state police inspector. 

The investigatory team plans to 

look into every aspect of the case 
to find any instances of unlawful 
conduct. 

‘U’ partners with 
Department of 
Defense for brain 
injury research

The University of Michigan 

Center for Integrative Research in 
Critical Care has paired up with 
the U.S. Department of Defense for 
new research into how the brain 
is impacted by severe trauamtic 
brain injuries, or TBIs. 

The pair will work to host 

the Massey Foundation TBI 
Grand Challenge. The event will 
encourage researchers to partner 
for groundbreaking research and 
submit project proposals.

A TBI is considered to be a 

form of brain injury resulting 
from a bump, blow or jolt to the 
head, which causes a disruption to 
normal brain function.

The challenge will reward 

funding to teams who develop 
diagnostic, device, therapeutic or 
health information technologies 
that deal with the initial “golden 
hour,” the first hour following a 
TBI, and the 24 to 48 of critical 
treatment hours after a severe TBI.

Awarded projects will be 

funded from a pool of up to 
$500,000 across a 12-month time 
period. Projects will be reviewed 
by the Massey Grand Challenge 
Steering Committte. 

TBI results in 52,000 death per 

year, making it the fourth leading 
cause of death in the United States. 
In 2010, approximately 2.5 million 
people suffered from a TBI.

“This is a tragedy that 

should not have happened,” 
Borrego said. “We know it is 
going to take time to address 
the infrastructure issues, to 
set up care for the children 
who ingested lead, and to 
determine how to prevent this 
from ever happening again. 
The University will continue 
to work in partnership to 
identify needs and contribute 
our 
faculty 
expertise 
and 

our service in support of our 
community.”

Earlier this week, Schlissel 

also announced $100,000 in 
seed funding would be allocated 
for research projects designed 
to address the Flint water crisis.

“At U-M, a crisis in the host 

city of one of campuses is a crisis 
that affects us all,” Schlissel said 
in a statement. “We will do all we 

can to ensure health and safety 
for our campus community and 
the people of Flint. We are all 
one family.”

Student organizations at the 

University have also worked 
to aid residents of Flint and 
other surrounding areas. The 
Black Student Union launched 
a GoFundMe page to collect 
money for fresh fruits and 
vegetables. 
Additionally, 
the 

Prevention Research and the 
Michigan 
Youth 
Violence 

Prevention Center has partnered 
for Fill-a-Truck for Flint’, an 
initiative to raise donations and 
collect bottled water for Flint 
residents.

The University’s Center for 

Engaged Academic Learning 
will also host the Tri-Campus 
Student Summit on February 
6. 
The 
event 
will 
feature 

workshops and consultations 
for undergraduates, as well 
as speakers who will discuss 
how students can get involved 
with providing aid for the Flint 
community.

also 
highlighted 
UM-Flint’s 

initiatives in a campus-wide 
e-mail Monday afternoon.

“We’re quite confident of the 

safety on campus,” Schlissel 
said at the meeting. “We’ve been 
doing ongoing outreach to Flint 
students. Most of them don’t live 
in University-owned facilities, 
some live at home and some in 
the surrounding communities. 
We want to make sure that 
in their own personal living 
circumstances that they know 
what’s going on, they have filters 
on their sources of water, they 
have access to testing and they’re 
kept up to date and informed.”

Schlissel said the campus has 

been working in partnership 
with the community by offering 
large-scale filter distribution 
events, free lead screening and 
other efforts.

“The 
University 
in 
Flint 

has been a vibrant part of the 
community for 60 years,” Schlissel 
said. “They are a longstanding 
partner with the community, and 
I admire the strength I’ve seen in 
that city’s residents.”

Finally, Schlissel also provided 

the Assembly with an update on 
the University’s progress toward 
a campus strategic plan for 
diversity. The University started 

a campus-wide initiative this 
year to address diversity issues 
on campus and improve campus 
climate, with the plan serving as 
a main focus. Currently, units 
around campus are creating 
individual plans, to be compiled 
into an overall plan this fall.

“I met with the leads of this 

planning process in all the 
different units last week,” he 
said. “They’re doing great work, 
there are good ideas bubbling up 
to the surface.”

Schlissel said he hopes by 

creating multiple committees to 
work on the issue, faculty and 
students will both be dedicated 
to the strategic plan.

“We’re looking to get good 

ideas from as many creative 
people from as many creative 
parts of the campus as possible,” 
Schlissel said. “The second part 
of this is to get buy-in. We’re 
much more likely to get true 
buy-in in ongoing involvement 
from colleagues involved in the 
developmental plan themselves 
and critiquing plans as they 
emerge.”

The Senate Assembly also 

voted on a new Nominating 
Committee 
for 
upcoming 

SACUA elections. SACUA will 
be losing an unprecedented 
six members in the coming 
academic year.

“The 
Nominating 

Committee’s task will be to both 

look at the nominations we have 
and look at staff nominations,” 
said 
Comparative 
Literature 

Prof. 
Silke-Maria 
Weineck, 

chair of SACUA. “It will also be 
to solicit nominations.”

Weineck said she hopes the 

nominating 
committee 
will 

diversify SACUA, noting that 
all the body’s female members, 
including herself, are leaving the 
committee.

The Senate Assembly also 

voted unanimously to endorse 
a 
statement 
of 
support 
to 

the 
Muslim 
community 
on 

campus. SACUA, the Assembly’s 
executive arm, endorsed the 
statement at its last meeting.

“At the last Senate Assembly 

meeting, 
we 
started 
this 

discussion 
of 
passing 
a 

statement in support of the 
Muslim community at U of M,” 
Weineck said. “SACUA passed 
such a resolution of support at 
our last meeting. But since we 
started the discussion at the 
assembly, we wanted to finish 
this discussion to see if the 
assembly itself might also want 
to endorse the statement.”

The statement says that the 

University’s 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
supports 
Muslim 

members of the community. It 
also condemns discrimination 
on 
campus, 
regardless 
of 

religious, national or ethnic 
affiliation.

didn’t feel like putting the 
effort in when my parents 
would 
drive 
me 
around,” 

McKeon said. “I also didn’t 
have money to buy a car so it 
just wasn’t logical to get my 
license.”

McKeon 
is 
not 
alone 

according 
to 
Sivak’s 
and 

Schoettle’s research; thirty-
seven 
percent 
of 
people 

surveyed claimed they did not 
get a license because they were 
simply too busy. Sivak and 
Schoettle also reported that 32 
percent of people who chose 
not to get a driver’s license 
were discouraged by costs of 
owning a car. 

In an interview, Schoettle 

said 
the 
study 
showed 

socioeconomic 
status 

influenced the results of the 
study.

“We 
did 
look 
at 

socioeconomic 
issues 
like 

education and employment,” 
Schoettle said. “We found that 
those without a license tended 
have less education and higher 
unemployment.”

While 
the 
researchers 

also attributed the decline to 
increasing 
costs 
associated 

with 
driving, 
Sivak 
and 

Schoettle said they did not 
believe increases in gas prices 
were a factor.

Adjusted 
according 
to 

inflation, gas cost 70 cents more 
per gallon at the end of 2013 
than in January 1983 according 
the Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics. The Bureau reports 

the biggest discrepancy in 
prices during the past 31 years 
was in May 2011 when gas 
prices were at an all-time high 
at $4.07 per gallon.

Along 
with 
fluctuating 

gas 
prices 
and 
automobile 

costs, 
environmental 
issues 

were tested as a factor in the 
reduction. 

Sivak 
and 
Schoettle’s 

research 
indicated 
those 

sentiments 
have 
moderate 

effects on fewer people getting 
their licenses — 8.6 percent 
of people surveyed reported 
wanting 
to 
protect 
the 

environment influenced their 
decision.

Despite 
the 
nationwide 

decrease, 
Suhail 
Bilbeisi, 

owner of the Ann Arbor Driving 
School, said he has not noticed 
a decrease in enrollment since 
opening his business in 2001. 
Rather, he said enrollment has 
risen despite class enrollment 
fees increasing by $25.

“We’ve been getting more 

students as the business has 
progressed,” Bilbeisi said.

Schoettle said he was unable 

to pinpoint the exact reasoning 
why Bilbeisi’s business has not 
noticed the trend, but said there 
could be a difference between 
local and national data.

“It is hard to say why a 

driving school might not be 
noticing this trend,” he said. 
“It could be that locally, the 
trend is a little different, or 
possibly that older people 
getting licenses are offsetting 
the reductions in younger 
drivers. It would be interesting 
to see if the age breakdown has 
changed for driving schools.”

attendees, 
sharing 
personal 

anecdotes exemplifying their 
experiences with Islamophobia 
on 
campus. 
Many 
audience 

members became emotional, and 
were moved to tears by many of 
the stories.

“By sharing one’s story, I 

think we can understand the 
different ways that it actually 
impacts 
students 
on 
this 

campus,” 
Alsultany 
said. 
“I 

hope that people (leave with) a 
new sense of understanding of 
how Islamophobia impacts our 
community and also leave with 
some ideas about how to be an 
ally, not only to Muslim students, 
but for any student on campus.”

LSA junior Tina Alkhersan, 

who 
served 
on 
the 
LSA 

committee that organized the 
event, said the event aimed to 
target non-Muslims and people 
who did not identify similarly to 
Muslims, so that students could 
express their beliefs in a positive 
and constructive manner.

“Ever since I was a freshman 

here, I felt really attached to 
the University of Michigan, and 
certain Islamophobic incidences 
would 
happen 
— 
American 

Sniper, Chapel Hill — and there 
was never a sense of a safe 
community,” 
Alkhersan 
said. 

“There was always a sense of 
fear and alarm,” referencing 
an incident in 2015 involving 
the University’s showing of the 
controversial 
film 
American 

Sniper and a shooting in which 
three Muslim students were 
killed.

Alkhersan said she wanted the 

event to be a forum for opening 
up and asking questions, as well 

as making acquaintances and 
forming friendships.

“I would feel accomplished 

if just one person walked out 
with their perception changed,” 
Alkhersan said.

Alkhersan, 
along 
with 

others 
on 
the 
organizing 

committee, shared a story from 
an anonymous student who did 
not want to present to attendees 
during the event. She said there 
was a fear among some students 
of being ridiculed for their 
vulnerability, so some committee 
members agreed to help them 
share 
their 
stories 
without 

releasing their identities.

Another student, who wished 

to remain unnamed, shared her 
story as well, discussing her 
experience as a minority Muslim 
student in high school. She 
recounted how her classmates 
shared Islamophobic opinions 
during class.

“‘They’re 
all 
terrorists 

anyway,” she said one of her 
classmates said to her. “They’re 
all evil,’”

Rackham graduate student 

Banen 
Al-Sheemary, 
who 

discussed 
how 
Islamophobia 

impacts safety on campus, said 
she decided to share her story at 
the event because she believes it 
is important for the student body 
to realize how big of an issue 
Islamophobia is.

“(The administration) needs 

to understand these narratives, 
they need to listen to these 
narratives,” Al-Sheemary said. 
“It’s so imperative and it really 
does affect our success here and 
our safety and our well-being.”

Al-Sheemary 
added 
there 

have been specific incidences 
where 
she 
has 
felt 
unsafe 

and discriminated against on 
campus.

“We are students who pay 

tuition, we are students who 
contribute to the community just 
like any other student,” she said 
during her story. “So what sets us 
apart from the rest of the student 
body that we have to walk in fear 
even in the afternoon?”

Al-Sheemary 
noted 
that 

there are many options that the 
University can put into place 
in order to ensure the concerns 
from the Muslim student body 
are acknowledged.

“The 
administration 
just 

has to take the time to actually 
listen and connect how social 
hierarchy, class, gender, sexual 
identity and racism shape the 
student experience and how 
difficult it is to navigate our 
world,” Al-Sheemary said.

At the end of the event, 

organizers 
asked 
attendees 

how institutions, groups and 
individuals on campus can show 
solidarity with students who 
experience Islamophobia.

LSA Dean Andrew Martin, 

who attended the event, said 
forums like this were important 
for the campus climate because 
one of the University’s challenges 
is creating a community that 
includes multiple identities. He 
said these types of conversations 
are crucial in creating the 
accepting 
community 
that 

people want to have on campus.

“It was an incredibly powerful 

event,” Martin said. “We have 
a lot of brave students who are 
willing to share their stories 
to help build community and 
help understand things that 
are happening on our campus 
that many members of our 
community don’t know much 
about.”

Another student, who also 

wished to remain anonymous, 

spoke 
during 
the 
open-mic 

portion of the event that followed 
the shared stories, retelling 
her story of growing up as a 
Palestinian Muslim-American.

“I honestly only felt safe 

when I was with my high school 
English teacher, who told me 
that everything would be OK 
once I entered the University 
of Michigan,” the student said. 
“However, nothing changed. I 
escaped to Michigan with the 
idea that I would be in a much 
safer environment.”

Adrienne Dessel, co-associate 

director of the Program on 
Intergroup Relations, also held 
a presentation toward the end of 
the event on being a constructive 
ally and encouraging positive 
communication among different 
ethnic and racial groups.

“The Program on Intergroup 

Relations is very interested in 
promoting ally work among 
students 
and 
promoting 

any event that will reduce 
discrimination 
and 
bias 
on 

campus,” Dessel said.

Dessel 
said 
she 
believes 

Islamophobia is an issue that is 
affecting some of the students 
on campus as a result of national 
racism 
and 
Islamophobia, 

negative 
media 
portrayals 

and lack of contact caused by 
segregation 
among 
different 

cultural groups that lead to 
harmful stereotypes.

“(We 
hope) 
for 
students’ 

stories to be shared and told 
and to provide students with 
some guidance and some skills,” 
Dessel said.

Martin said he believes the 

University needs to articulate 
inclusion as a core value by taking 
initiative and following up on the 
issues identified during the event 
to ensure that the University 

is 
fostering 
an 
inclusive 

environment for all students.

“It’s 
really 
important, 

particularly given the discourse 
that’s happening in our broader 
politics 
today, 
to 
focus 
on 

Islamophobia and how it affects 
our Muslim students,” Martin 
said. “I’m really proud of the 
work that the students put into 
organizing this event. I found 
that the stories that the students 
brought to the front required a 
great deal of courage, and I think 
were painful to hear, but I think 
will be constructive in community 
building going forward.”

Angela Dillard, associate dean 

for undergraduate education, 
was also in attendance and said 
she hopes those who attended 
the event will be more sensitive 
to Islamophobia on campus.

“Certainly (Islamophobia) is 

one of the big issues that we’ve 
been looking at and worried 
about,” Dillard said. “I definitely 
thought it was appropriate for 
this group to take on, especially 
right now, given what’s been 
going on nationally, what’s been 
going on internationally.”

Dillard said it was crucial to 

lead initiatives on inclusivity with 
students telling their own stories, 
even though they are sometimes 
shocking and upsetting.

“One of the things that has been 

a little surprising to me is finding 
out what might be the depth of 
underreporting 
of 
incidents, 

of bias, of microaggressions,” 
Dillard said. “There seems to 
be a little confusion about how 
one goes about reporting, which 
leads to ideas of what can we do 
to make it clearer, what can we 
do to make it safer and what can 
we do to make sure that people 
have a sense that something is 
being done to follow up.”

experience for receiving alerts 
which needs to be smoothed 
out,” she said. 

She added that because the 

notifications can only be 100 
characters each, DPSS’s focus 
for the upcoming months will 
be on how to create precise and 

informative alerts to ensure 
each fits the formatting for 
all messaging systems at their 
disposal. 

Surrounding 
universities 

such 
as 
Michigan 
State, 

Western Michigan and Central 
Michigan all use e-mails and 
texts to inform students of 
any dangers on campus, but 
have not developed anything 
beyond that, according to their 

websites. 

Brown 
said 
focusing 
on 

improving safety within the 
Ann Arbor community was the 
project’s main focus.

“We have people on staff 

who are aware of what they are 
doing at other schools, but that 
is not our main focus,” she said. 
“We worry about getting the 
message out as soon as we can, 
as fast as we can.”

T

he Flint water crisis dramati-
cally calls attention to the 
inherent dangers of Gov. Rick 

Snyder’s 
emer-

gency managers. 
But if you listen 
to Snyder, you 
might not realize 
that EMs even played a role in this 
crisis.

In his State of the State address, 

Snyder only mentioned emergen-
cy managers once. He said, “This 
crisis began in the spring of 2013 
when the Flint City Council voted 
7-1 to buy water from the Kare-
gnondi Water Authority. Former 
Flint Mayor Walling supported the 
move and the emergency manager 
approved the plan.”

This statement could mislead you 

in two ways. First, regarding the 
facts about emergency management 
that he strategically omitted, Snyder 
failed to mention that “[a]fter initial-
ly supporting the plan, the Flint City 
Council, reacting to public outrage 
over water quality, voted (in early 
2015) to return to the Detroit sys-
tem … EM Jerry Ambrose, the fourth 
person to hold that job in Flint, over-
ruled the vote of those elected offi-
cials, forcing residents to continue 
using river water.”

From Snyder’s statement, you 

might interpret the EM’s role as 
mostly advisory. But from the record 
assembled by journalists, such as the 
American Civil Liberties Union’s 
Curt Guyette (quoted above), the 
picture looks quite different. We see 
that EM Ambrose prevented local, 
elected officials from executing the 
will of their constituency. This is not 
the act of an adviser. It’s the act of an 
authoritarian.

Second, though the immediate 

crisis probably began when Sny-
der claims, his timeline limits our 
understanding of the problems in 
Flint to the relatively recent past. 
Likewise, from Snyder’s statements, 
the issues involved in the Flint 
water crisis appear highly specific 
and isolated, not systemic or struc-
tural. He is focused on solving the 
“lead problem” in Flint. For many 
of us, this is far too simple-minded. 

To us, the lead contamination is an 
especially painful and visible symp-
tom of the many diseases raging 
through the body of America today 
— e.g. white supremacy, global capi-
talism, economic terrorism, etc.

The anti-democratic history of 

Snyder’s emergency management 
policy helps us understand its cata-
strophic application in the case of 
Flint. In November 2012, Michi-
gan voters rejected Michigan’s first 
emergency manager law, Public Act 
4 of 2011, via referendum. Less than 
two months later, Snyder signed 
Public Act 436 of 2012, which was 
mostly similar to Public Act 4, 
except it included an appropria-
tion that made it immune to refer-
endum. At the time, Snyder hailed 
the replacement EM law, saying, 
“This legislation demonstrates that 
we clearly heard, recognized and 
respected the will of the voters … It 
builds in local control and options 
while also ensuring the tools to 
protect communities and school 
districts’ residents, students and 
taxpayers.”

As Snyder understands it, “the 

will of the voters,” as expressed in 
the referendum, is for laws immune 
to referendum, unlike the one 
they’d just rejected (via referen-
dum). Clearly, the voters want less 
direct say in the laws that govern 
them. In Snyder’s mind, there’s 
no question that the voters desire 
emergency management, since they 
cannot possibly be trusted to elect 
competent 
representatives. 
The 

people need a strong man, a patri-
arch, to “manage” them, temper-
ing their desires for basic resources 
such as fresh water with more seri-
ous concerns such as balancing the 
budget. We are too weak and meek 
to make the hard choice of auster-
ity, so we desire someone to impose 
it upon us. In these troubled times, 
democracy must be suspended.

Only such absurd, fascistic phi-

losophy could possibly explain 
the decision to impose emergency 
management and austerity in spite 
of the voters’ rejection of it. It’s 
blatantly disrespectful to our basic 
desire for autonomy and ignorant 

to the structural sources of Flint’s 
financial collapse.

One safety of municipal democ-

racy lies in the fact that elected 
representatives live in the commu-
nities they serve. They often direct-
ly experience the problems they 
seek to solve — like when they turn 
on the tap, they see brown water 
running. They are interpersonally 
tied to their constituency. On the 
other hand, emergency managers 
have none of these characteristics, 
and so, much like police officers 
employed outside their home com-
munities, they don’t have any direct, 
personal stake in the well-being of 
the communities they serve.

After the switch from Lake 

Huron water to Flint River water, 
the people of Flint knew immedi-
ately that something was wrong: 
The water didn’t look right (it had 
a brown tinge), it didn’t smell right 
(kind of like rotten eggs) and it 
didn’t taste right (metallic). But 
such plebian methods of detecting 
problems, like using the cognitive 
faculties of sight, smell and taste, 
are, by our government’s stan-
dards, unreliable and cannot con-
stitute true knowledge. (Though 
brown 
water 
isn’t 
necessarily 

toxic, it’s a pretty good indicator 
of the need for further research; 
What’s more, it wouldn’t be toler-
ated in affluent white communi-
ties.) Thus, in turn, their voices 
were ignored and their collective 
will suppressed.

People 
calling 
for 
Snyder’s 

arrest and/or resignation specifi-
cally because of Flint’s lead con-
tamination should prepare for 
the criminal investigations not to 
return a smoking gun. The state 
bureaucracy will likely filter out 
any responsibility before it reaches 
the governor’s office, and then the 
people will not have their justice. 
Instead, we should recall Snyder 
because he has impeded democ-
racy and threatens to continue to 
impede democracy with his policy 
of emergency management.

iMessages, Apple’s propri-
etary 
messaging 
format, 

not standard SMS text mes-
sages. If an iPhone user were to send a message 
to an Android phone (like my Google Nexus 6P), 
the Android response would show up in a green 
bubble on the iPhone, indicating the messages 
are SMS. Unlike SMS, iMessages can be natively 
sent over Wi-Fi, traced as “read” or “unread,” and 
do not possess character limits. Technologically 
speaking, iMessages are superior to SMS.

Chances are you already knew all of that. 

Apparently, iPhones are popular. A walk through 
the Diag or a glance around an Angell Hall audi-
torium only confirms this fact. From my three 
years of experience at Michigan, it is very clear 
that we as a university do indeed bleed blue.

As a Michigan student, I realize the off-put-

ting nature of anything green. However, I never 
realized the extent to which many people out-
right hate receiving green bubbles. Beyond the 
common “Why don’t you just get an iPhone?” I 
get from my friends a few times a month, I have 
seen a number of top yaks pop up on Yik Yak diss-
ing those of us who choose the green bubbles. 
However, I figured occurrences such as these 
were the exception, not the norm. That is, until I 
read a recent piece by Paul Ford.

All you need to know about Ford’s piece can 

be found by doing a quick search on Twitter for 
“green bubble.” It turns out those top yaks were 
more of the norm than the exception after all.

As an Android user on a largely iPhone-based 

campus, I understand the technological com-
plaints about green bubbles. They’re slower, you 
can’t send them from your MacBook and they 
absolutely destroy any type of group text. You 
have a right to hate the underlying and dated 
technology that is the green bubble. You do not, 
however, have the right to hate the green bub-
ble in and of itself because, in some parts of the 
world, blue is synonymous with green.

In passing discussions, international students 

have told me of the messaging service What-
sApp. It operates in a similar fashion to iMessage 
and is technologically superior to SMS in pretty 

much every way. However, unlike iMessage, 
WhatsApp is cross-platform, meaning iPhones, 
Android phones and even Windows phones (yes, 
those do exist) can all reap its benefits. This is one 
of the many reasons WhatsApp is one of the most 
popular messaging services in the world.

To any of the hundreds of millions of 

WhatsApp users, green and blue bubbles are 
equal; they are not WhatsApp messages, so 
they are inferior. Like my iPhone-owning 
roommates hate my Android phone, What-
sApp users hate iMessage.

All of this hate can manifest into something 

real. While many people are merely joking, some 
of those tweets you might have found in your 
search reflect real people making real life choices 
to avoid those of the green bubble. Dates are can-
celed, friendships are strained, people clash.

A recent article from The Verge detailed how 

one of the publication’s writers suffering from 
depression purchased an iPhone in order to gain 
access into his friend groups’ iMessage chats, 
which he was previously excluded from as an 
Android user. To know such a minor feature 
could have such a profound effect on a person’s 
life really struck me. What if I’m missing out on 
my friends’ conversations because I’m green?

What is the solution to this problem? In the-

ory, iMessage on Android would fix your group 
chats in an instant. But this is unlikely to happen, 
as iMessage is a defining feature of iPhones, and 
the societal pressure to adhere to the blue bubble 
is a powerful economic force. It is, after all, the 
only reason I’ve ever legitimately contemplated 
getting an iPhone.

A second solution would be for the entire 

world to use WhatsApp or any similar service 
like we all once used SMS. Given that many 
friend groups have a tough time finding a restau-
rant in Ann Arbor on which they can all agree, 
deciding on one messaging platform is an ideal 
but unlikely solution, at least in the near future.

A final solution would be for us all to just 

live in harmony — blue, green, WhatsApp and 
more. In the short run, we miss out on some of 
the benefits of living in a unified, all-iMessage 
or all-WhatsApp world. But in the long run, we 
allow important societal and individual charac-
teristics, such as a person’s moral fiber, devotion 
to friendship or general personality dictate our 
relationships, not a silly colored bubble.

After all, I am green. Your grandmother 

with a flip phone is green. Your friend who 
goes to Michigan State is green. It would be a 
shame to let something as trivial as the color 
of our bubbles on your phone dictate our rela-
tionships with people like you.

Green and blue bubbles

In our world, I believe progress often happens 

slowly. I believe the path to significant, ideologi-
cal change is rooted in dedication, conversation 
and activism; in listening to those with perspec-
tives and stories that differ from your own; and in 
programs like the one I was able to participate in 
this year on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

I spent last Monday in Detroit taking part in 

a daylong, thought-provoking program honoring 
King and his work, examining the modern-day 
civil rights struggle and working on a handful of 
service projects in the southwest neighborhood 
of the city. Our cohort consisted of teens and 
young adults from various youth groups, high 
schools, universities and communities — each 
individual hailing from a unique background and 
bringing a unique voice to the table.

The majority of my time was spent talking 

to someone who, over the course of the day, I 
would come to know as one of the most passion-
ate and driven people I have ever had the plea-
sure of meeting. She was a senior in high school, 
a Detroiter and a self-proclaimed lover of history 
and advocate for social justice. We made signs 
for the Martin Luther King Jr. march downtown 
(posters with messages ranging from “#Black-
LivesMatter” to “Water 4 All”) and dove deeply 
into conversation about race, privilege and 
power. We talked about the issues that persist in 
our country in and around the modern-day civil 
rights movement openly and honestly — topics 
that are incredibly important, yet all too often 
deemed as “taboo” or left unacknowledged by 
our society. She gave me new ideas, new vocabu-
lary and a new perspective — and I like to believe 
I offered her the same.

When the day had come to an end, my mind 

was racing. It was easy to recognize that our con-
versation was far from complete. In fact, it had 
really only just begun.

This realization — that our discussion about 

systemic social issues was not nearly finished 
and that the ideas we were sharing were hardly 
fleshed out in full — made me view this program 
as more than just a gift of fate. I began to see it 
as more than just an educational opportunity or a 

way of bringing diverse individuals and commu-
nities together. I started to think of the program, 
and of Martin Luther King Jr. Day in general, as 
an invitation: an invitation to begin and continue 
to participate in a conversation that has been 
going on for centuries, that analyzes every diffi-
cult and uncomfortable aspect of our society and 
that we should be having all the time.

I believe that where there is dialogue, there 

is power; where there are people coming 
together with open minds and open hearts, 
there is room for opportunity and societal and 
ideological change. The conversations that mil-
lions of Americans have on Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day each year (in Detroit, in Ann Arbor and 
all over the country) should not cease to exist 
when the march ends, when Martin Luther 
King Jr. Symposium keynote lecturer Naomi 
Tutu leaves the stage, when the group dispers-
es or even when a new day begins. The ideas 
and concepts we all think about so critically 
and carefully in honor of King should continue 
to be considered the following morning; they 
should be thought about daily and manifested 
into conversation regularly.

If you have not already received it, I want to 

extend the invitation I was presented with in 
Detroit last Monday to all of you now. I want to 
challenge our community — here on campus, in 
Ann Arbor and beyond — to continue these con-
versations past the scope of Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day, to continue to seek out spaces where open 
and respectful discussions about the most press-
ing issues in our country are being had and to ask 
others to do the same. I want to encourage us all 
to speak out against injustice in any and all forms 
and to never shy away from the conversations 
our communities and our nation need the most. 
Doing so is not an end-all solution to the large-
scale social injustices that persist in our country 
by any means; rather, it is a step along the way, 
one that is absolutely imperative in order for us to 
create a brighter future filled with light and love 
as King once so famously dreamed.

ELLIOTT 
RAINS

I

t wasn’t until the second day 
of Math 115 my first semes-
ter here that I realized I was 

in way over my 
head. After hav-
ing rushed into 
class, my back-
pack 
unzipped 

in 
a 
manner 

that screamed “frantic freshman” 
and my graphing calculator buried 
under a pile of notebooks and fold-
ers, I sat down next to a group of 
students, all discussing their future 
academic plans. Wide-eyed, I lis-
tened to each individual recount 
their aspirations to major in STEM 
fields and how this class was just 
their “easy” step before ultimately 
conquering the heights of Calculus 
II and III. In contrast, I only need-
ed one quantitative reasoning cred-
it, and since I liked calculus in high 
school, I figured this class would 
be the reasonable answer … right? 
As the future engineers continued 
to prattle on about topics I did not 
understand, I quickly realized I had 
never doubted my academic prow-
ess more.

I’ve experienced these feelings 

of doubt not only in academics, but 
also in athletics. My first day of col-
legiate cross-country camp, after 
getting back from what was sup-
posed to be a relatively comfort-
able seven-mile run (that left the 
freshmen gasping for air), I pan-
icked. Thoughts raced through my 
head such as “these people are all 
so much more talented than me,” “I 
don’t deserve to be here” and ulti-
mately “am I just going to make a 
big fool out of myself?” As the days 
passed, these negative thoughts 
continued to stir in the back of my 
mind, slowly but surely eating away 
at my self-confidence.

Unfortunately for myself and 

many others, this sinking feeling of 

self-doubt and total unworthiness is 
all too common — especially at a uni-
versity such as this one where thou-
sands of bright students are brought 
together to learn. Just recently, I 
realized this feeling has a name. In 
1978, psychologists Pauline Clance 
and Suzanne Imes coined the term 
“imposter syndrome” to describe 
the tendency of highly successful, 
highly intelligent people to believe 
their accomplishments are the result 
of luck, and that they are essentially 

total frauds. This description has a 
flair for the dramatic, but just think 
of the numerous times you have 
downplayed your past successes or 
doubted your abilities (despite pal-
pable results) based on the thought 
that the people around you are so 
much more qualified or intelligent.

This phenomenon occurs not only 

in calculus class or in a varsity sport 
— but in the real world as well, from 
job interviews to acting in films to 
publishing critically acclaimed nov-
els. Maya Angelou, of all people, said, 
“I have written 11 books, but each 
time I think, ‘Uh oh, they’re going 
to find out now. I’ve run a game on 
everybody, and they’re going to find 
me out.’ ”

I’m no Maya Angelou, but I can’t 

even count the number of times I’ve 
passed on submitting works of writ-
ing or applying for positions because 
I think I’m simply not good enough. 
Yet, by counting myself out from 
the get-go, I’m not being humble, 
I’m just being a coward and have no 
chance of ever achieving my dreams. 
Maybe it’s not inadequacy that we 
fear, but what lies beyond the vast 
expanses of our greatest potential.

I’m in no way telling you to be 

an obnoxious narcissist or to start 
believing you’re qualified to run this 
country, but just give yourself some 
credit. You made it here, you’re fig-
uring things out and you’re still the 
same kick-butt person you were 
when you received your admis-
sion letter and laughed and danced 
around your kitchen — giddy at the 
idea of the numerous opportunities 
and dreams finally in your grasp.

Yes, I am on a team surrounded 

by some of the most talented girls 
in the nation, which can be intimi-
dating, but it can also be incred-
ibly motivating. I still doubt myself 
sometimes, but as the days wear on, 
I realize that I (along with all of my 
teammates) am here for a reason. It’s 
a definite adjustment, but that’s just 
the nature of life.

As for calculus? It was tough, but 

I made it through — just the same 
as everyone else. I soon realized 
that the future engineers who had 
so intimidated me at the beginning 
of the term were extremely help-
ful whenever I needed a problem 
explained or help with team home-
work. I struggled, but so did many 
people. My early feelings of inad-
equacy did not make me an “impos-
ter” or “unqualified,” but simply 
human.

Chairlift won’t take 
risks on new ‘Moth’

By REGAN DETWILER

Daily Arts Writer

I think what Chairlift really 

wants from a review is for their 
’08 iPod nano commercial hit, 
“Bruises,” 
to 

not 
be 
men-

tioned. 
My 

apologies, 
guys. 
Every-

thing from the 
sheer nostalgia 
it elicits to its 
endearingly 
synth 
rhythm 

to its lyrics make mentioning it 
irresistible (I grabbed some fro-
zen strawberries so I could ice 
your bruising knees). It was that 
adorable indie hit before adorable 
indie hits were cool.

Moth is the New York duo’s 

most bright and upbeat release 
thus 
far. 
Singer 
Caroline 

Polachek’s vocals are similar to 
those of Marina Diamandis of 
Marina and the Diamonds, but 
the lyrics on this latest album 
don’t quite have that death-can-
dy depth of avant-pop artists like 
Marina. In fact, it’s difficult to 
place Chairlift in any genre right 
now. They’re avant-pop and/
or synth-pop, but Moth doesn’t 
quite place them into the either 
of those (fairly specific) catego-
ries. Those genres elicit artists 
like Marina, Lana, even Phanto-
gram or Grimes, if you want to 
go there. But Chairlift isn’t really 
anything like any of those.

They’re still stuck in the la-la 

land limbo of alt-pop artists like 
La Roux who only had one U.S. 
hit and never really got both 
feet off the ground. The album 
is good but not great. It’s good 
but not good. You can listen to 
Moth for something that will 
suffice. For example, two of 
the catchiest, most danceable 
tracks, “Ch-Ching” and “Moth 
to the Flame,” offer little con-
ceptual complexity beyond the 
content of their titles. Neither 
change your worldview, nei-
ther will change the way you 
perceive contemporary culture 
but they will allow you to main-
tain your reputation as someone 
who “likes good music.”

There is at least one track 

that gets me feeling, and it’s 
“Crying in Public.” While most 
of the songs on Moth have vague 
lyrics that come off as distant 
and impersonal — especially 
when paired with Chairlift’s 
characteristic 
technologized, 

synthey aesthetic — they get 

slow and deep on this track. 
The lyrics speak to tender and 
conflicting emotions of crying 
about and loving someone at the 
same time — crying because you 
love them. Polachek’s vocals 
also shine, coming out sinewy 
and clear.

But that’s only one song. 

While Moth has a few shining 
moments, the fact of the mat-
ter is Chairlift hasn’t put any-
thing out that tops their first 
album, Does You Inspire You, 
featuring “Bruises.” And their 
latest release is no exception. 
Their sound in ’08 was original, 
fresh and ahead of its time. Lyr-
ics spoke to social issues and 
gave considerable attention to 
critiquing 
the 
consumerism 

emerging in our country at the 
time, which has run rampant 
by now. On that first album 
they gave 4:45 to a song about 
how much garbage we produce. 
Track names included (you 
guessed it) “Garbage” and “Le 
Flying Saucer Hat.” Um, yes 
please. When I see “Ch-Ching” 
on the track list of this latest 
release I just don’t get quite as 
excited. Chairlift contributed 
something new with Does You 
Inspire You, and they haven’t 
done so since.

Moth is nice. It’s pretty good. 

But Chairlift, give us some-
thing cool, something great, 
something weird. We know it’s 
in you, and it’s waiting to be 
released. Maybe next year?

ALBUM REVIEW
Powerful ‘Coliseum’

By REGAN DETWILER

Daily Arts Writer

You know those weird bands 

you find only by way of indie 
movie soundtrack? Well, The 
Besnard Lakes 
are 
one 
of 

those. 
Mark 

Ruffalo found 
them in what 
he 
called 
a 

“little 
cache 

in 
Montreal” 

of DIY musi-
cians, many of 
which — like 
The 
Besnard 

Lakes — have 
their 
own 

recording studios and equip-
ment. He wanted them for his 
2010 film “Sympathy for Deli-
cious,” which won the Special 
Jury Prize and was nominated 
for the Grand Jury Prize at Sun-
dance in 2010.

Something between Beach 

House, Arcade Fire and Band of 

Horses, they sound like an alt-
rockified amalgamation of ’60s 
rock and contemporary ambient 
electronic. Married couple Jace 
Lasek and Olga Gureas form 
the group’s core, and they’ve 
just released their fifth album, 
A Coliseum Complex Museum. 
None of their releases goes over 
45 minutes long and few go over 
8 tracks — their songs are meant 
to be listened to as part of a 
whole. Sometimes it takes sev-
eral minutes (or several songs) 
to come across any lyrics at all.

Well, it sometimes takes several 

minutes to come across any spoken 
lyrics. The music itself, though, 
is very organically expressive, 
almost lyrical in its sonic quality 
alone. The music does not need the 
crude approximation of words as 
a crutch for delivering meaning — 
the meaning transcends. Perhaps 
this is what the core duo means 
when they say that being in nature 
inspires them, for their sensibility 
might even be described as tran-
scendentalist. 

A Coliseum Complex Museum 

is not by any means a departure 
from earlier work. It seems to 
follow the same trajectory, but 
it’s more conducive to casual 
listening on a track-by-track 
basis than on a full-album scale. 
The album’s only single, “The 
Plain Moon,” could even be 
described as catchy, something 
one couldn’t have said quite as 
easily for previous releases.

This is not to say A Coli-

seum Complex Museum repre-
sents the group selling out by 
any means. They maintain the 
same gritty, kinda dirty, alt-
rock, technofolk sound they’ve 
always had — but this album 
feels like it has a little more 
momentum behind it than pre-
vious releases. The Besnard 
Lakes are a hidden gem, unas-
suming in a sea of alternative 
music that these days can feel 
a little too overwrought, a little 
too heady. A Coliseum Complex 
Museum is like a tension-releas-
ing exhale.

LITERATURE COLUMN

Contemporary lit’s 

changing form

“

“The only way to make 
sense out of change is to 
plunge into it, move with 

it and join the dance.” The late 
philosopher Alan Watts was not 
referring 
to the tech-
nological 
revolution of 
literary cul-
ture in the 
last twenty 
years, but 
these words 
are an 
unequivo-
cal push for 
writers unwilling to adapt to the 
changes in their industry.

We can freely admit that 

writing isn’t what is used to be. 
From entry points into the busi-
ness, to ideas of promotion, to 
the literal form of novels, tech-
nology guarantees that nothing 
remains constant. Rather than 
yearning for an age I barely 
knew, though, I’m choosing to 
embrace the way social media 
and the Internet in general has 
changed our lives.

Instead of relying on an 

agent to promote their works 
(though agents are still hugely 
important to novelists), many 
authors are joining social media 
and connecting with their audi-
ences directly and interactively. 
Respected authors such as Mar-
garet Atwood, Gary Shteyngart 
and Joyce Carol Oates have 
joined the 974 million exist-
ing Twitter accounts to share 
a part of themselves with their 
fans and readers. (Seriously, fol-
low Joyce Carol Oates on Twit-
ter. One of her latest tweets: 
“Tried to combine #National 
Hug Day with #Squirrel Appre-
ciation Day with unfortunate 
results.” Genius.)

But not all writers have 

joined the bandwagon of social 
media. Most noticeably, Jona-
than Franzen, author of “The 
Corrections,” “Freedom” and 
most recently “Purity,” has 
denounced Twitter as “unspeak-
ably irritating. Twitter stands 
for everything I oppose.” In 
2013, Franzen specifically called 
out commercial women’s fiction 
writer Jennifer Weiner for her 
self-promotion via social media. 
Weiner retorted with an article 
in The New Republic arguing 
that Twitter isn’t primarily a 

means of self-promotion; it’s a 
way to access the world’s “best 
cocktail party.”

This literary tussle between 

Franzen and Weiner represents 
the undeniable shift in contem-
porary literary culture. Some, 
like Franzen, see social media as 
the worst extension of ourselves, 
a manipulative way to create a 
false, misleadingly improved 
online person. Others like Wein-
er view it as a fun way to connect 
with and entertain readers and 
other authors.

In other corners of the Inter-

net, less established writers 
have a chance. Sure, there’s 
some weird Poot Lovato fan 
fiction and the sorts of obses-
sive chat rooms that create 
phenomena like “50 Shades of 
Grey,” but there’s also some 
exceptional writing being done. 
Websites like Wordpress and 
Tumblr allow users to display 
their work on a free platform 
and gather an online follow-
ing. With a large enough online 
readership, there is almost a 
guaranteed audience for an 
actual novel.

The expansion in the rela-

tionship between readers and 
authors is another major devel-
opment caused by the Internet. 
We’ve created an incredibly 
large global locale, one in which 
we can reach out to someone 
across the world and get a 
response as quickly as that of 
someone across the room. For 
authors, this means they can 
be in direct contact with their 
readership during all phases 
of writing. When Aziz Ansari 
wrote his brilliant exploration 
of different romantic landscapes 
in the recent novel “Modern 
Romance,” he reached out to the 
Reddit community and asked 
them to share their experiences. 
Ansari and his co-author, New 
York University professor Eric 

Klinenberg, used comments 
from Reddit users to explain the 
social phenomena in the book.

We can be so close now to the 

producers of our literature that 
we can literally take part in its 
creation. But social media is also 
changing the form that litera-
ture can take. The definition of 
what “writing” is has changed 
since media platforms have 
allowed everyone to become a 
writer in some sense of the word. 
Writing takes place on all forms 
of social media, but there’s a 
shift in storytelling form as well. 
Narratives like “Hey Harry Hey 
Matilda,” an epistolary novel 
between a brother and sister, are 
being told over Instagram, with 
photos accompanying the serial-
ized text.

While “Hey Harry Hey 

Matilda” is a thoughtful exper-
iment in social media and its 
relationship to the narrative 
form, the presence of social 
media has spawned some more 
spontaneous stories. The viral 
Twitter drama of Zola, which 
she describes as “long but…full 
of suspense” was one of the 
better instances of pop culture 
in 2015.

Zola is a Hooters waitress 

who is invited by a customer 
for a weekend of dancing in 
Florida, but the excursion 
quickly devolves into a narrative 
explosion of strippers, violence 
and spectacle. After reading 
the whole story, Ava DuVernay, 
director of “Selma” and “Middle 
of Nowhere” wrote on Twitter, 
“In India reading #Zola. Drama, 
humor, action, suspense, charac-
ter development. She can write. 
There’s so much untapped talent 
in the hood.”

In the past few years, the 

Internet has forced literature 
into somewhat of a crossroads. 
We’re constantly redefining 
what it means to be a writer 
and how to reconcile our pre-
conceived notions of literature 
with the burgeoning technol-
ogy at our fingertips. We have 
a choice to make — stubbornly 
linger in the past or bask in the 
developing democratization of 
storytelling.

TV REVIEW
Showtime’s ‘Billions’ 
is full of testosterone

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

Showtime’s new series “Bil-

lions” doesn’t quite match the 
spectacular parade of excess in 
“The Wolf of 
Wall Street.” 
But 
it 
also 

isn’t the har-
rowing 
look 

at the 2008 
economic col-
lapse and cor-
ruption of big 
banks 
cyni-

cally dissect-
ed by “The Big 
Short.” It’s the story of power-
ful U.S. District Attorney Chuck 
Rhoades (Paul Giamatti, “Love 
& Mercy”) and his mission to 
take down hedge fund giant 
Bobby “Axe” Axelrod (Damian 
Lewis, “Homeland”). The show-
down between corruption and 
justice isn’t as simple as we’d 
like to believe it is, and “Bil-
lions” goes to great lengths to 
demonstrate this theme.

If you are an advocate of jus-

tice and hate the “one percent,” 
then the show expects you to 
root for Chuck in his relentless 
pursuit of Axe and his financial 
empire. However, in the show’s 
opening Chuck is introduced 
bound and powerless (consen-
sually, we assume), under a 
mysterious figure dressed in 
dominatrix attire. The unset-
tling details of this short, yet 
repellant scene don’t bear men-
tioning. But its role in charac-
terizing Chuck, the supposed 
hero of this series, is significant 
and 
necessitates 
discussion. 

Why show the formidable pin-
nacle of justice, U.S. attorney, 
husband and father of two get-
ting sexually dominated within 
the first 30 seconds of the pre-
miere? Pure shock value?

What’s more, this introduc-

tion is followed by Rhoades’s 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Kate 
(Condola 
Rashad, 
“Master 

of None”) lecturing an office 
newcomer about having to “be 
beyond reproach.” These words 
linger as, for the first time in the 
episode, Rhoades is revealed 
to be none other than the New 
York U.S. District Attorney. The 
stark 
contradiction 
between 

the two images of Rhoades is 
the first of many ploys to subtly 
build tension throughout the 
episode that instead result in 
lukewarm uneasiness. No one 
wants to see a middle-aged man 
(particularly one with clout) 
getting kinky.

The most contrived part of 

the plot is the role Axe’s wife 
Lara (Malin Akerman, “Watch-
men”) plays. The girl from 
a poor New York Irish fam-
ily turned billionaire’s wife 
– poised, yet retaining a tough 
edge –– is like a shoe that fits 
half a size too big on Akerman, 
adding little depth to her char-
acter. When a former partner’s 
wife embarrasses Axe in front 
of his employees, Lara’s thinly 
veiled threat lacks the punch it 
tries to deliver. She only serves 
as an accessory to Axe’s char-
acter –– another strand in the 
unravelling rope of his relatable 
image.

There’s no such thing as a 

relatable billionaire. Axe’s rep-
utation as a “man of the people” 
(he eats pizza at his old neigh-
borhood joint … then decides to 
invest in it) is a weakly devised 
obstacle put up for Chuck to 
knock down in his fight against 
Axelrod. Despite this, Lewis’s 
performance as the acute, ego-
istic alpha male is convincing. 
Between his and Giamatti’s 
subtle glares and weighted one-
liners, the antagonism between 
the two is palpable.

Also complicating Axe’s his-

tory is his role as the only sur-
viving partner of his hedge fund 
after 9/11. The tragic circum-
stances of his ascent to power 
leave us uncertain whether 
to feel sorry for him or resent 
him. As the episode unfolds, it 
becomes clearer that the man 
is power hungry and manipula-

tive, purchasing an ostentatious 
mansion and “good-naturedly” 
pitting his kids against one 
another in a trivia match at the 
dinner table.

Aesthetically, the show has 

some redeeming qualities. A 
quick cut away to the sweaty 
fingerprints left on a leather 
chair by an old colleague Dan 
Margolis 
(Daniel 
Cosgrove, 

“Days of Our Lives”) confirms 
Axe’s suspicions that he’s an 
FBI informant. The sleek cin-
ematography highlights Axe’s 
smooth demeanor and makes 
Rhoades appear even more 
overwrought than his agitated 
nature suggests he is. And while 
Axe maintains his austerity at 
all times, we see Rhoades soft-
en in the presence of his wife, 
Wendy (Maggie Siff, “Sons of 
Anarchy”). 

Wendy Rhoades can’t go with-

out mentioning. Her position as 
an HR executive for Axe Capital 
(Axelrod’s company) puts her 
in the convenient predicament 
of working for the target of her 
husband’s crusade against profi-
teering. She’s a powerhouse in 
her own right, but when Chuck’s 
attack on Axe escalates she’s 
forced to choose: her job or her 
husband (the timeworn source 
of marital conflict)? With all the 
testosterone coursing through 
the series, it’s refreshing to have 
a wife who isn’t just a narrative 
embellishment. But between her 
and Lara, there isn’t much going 
on for women in this series. 
Especially not for Chuck’s moth-
er, who’s relegated to the kitch-
en by Chuck’s calculating, upper 
crust attorney of a father.

This brings us back to Chuck, 

who’s clearly sitting on top of 
some deep-seated issues. His 
character, combined with Axe’s 
guile and America’s interest 
with the financial sector, will 
hopefully make for some inter-
esting episodes as the series 
moves forward.

‘The X-Files’ return 
short of high hopes

By CHLOE GILKE

Daily Arts Writer

Fourteen years after its series 

finale, “The X-Files” is back on 
FOX, and it’s … well, I wish I could 
say it’s great. 
Between 
the 

deafening hype 
and the murky 
track record of 
series 
creator 

Chris Carter’s 
late-period cre-
ative 
choices, 

I adjusted my 
expectations 
for the revival 
series 
to 
be 

accordingly 
low. Even if the rebooted “The 
X-Files” were just a welcome 
reunion between me and my two 
all-time favorite characters, with 
nothing else redeemable, I told 
myself I’d be satisfied.

I wish seeing Scully and Mul-

der was enough. “The X-Files” has 
some addictive alien substance in 
its DNA that makes it irresistible 
to fans and the perfect receptacle 
for cult worship, which makes 
it impossible to write about the 
show without bringing myself 
and my experience with it into the 
fold. While I love “The X-Files” to 
death, I’ve always kept a Scully-
esque skeptic’s attitude and a criti-

cal eye toward the flaws that have 
been there since episode one. The 
show is wildly uneven, with some 
of the cases and episodes deserv-
ing a spot in the Great TV Canon, 
and others so forgettable they 
burn themselves into your brain 
(I’m looking at you, “First Person 
Shooter”).

“My Struggle” doesn’t fall into 

either of these two categories. It 
contains all of “The X-Files” ’s 
most dangerous trappings, yet also 
maintains vestiges of what made 
the show so great two decades 
ago. The episode’s intro sequence, 
featuring resident supernatural 
enthusiast Fox Mulder (David 
Duchovny, “Californication”) nar-
rating the events of the previous 
nine seasons, is creative shorthand 
meant to catch new viewers up to 
speed. While stock photo images 
and newspaper clippings flash by, 
Mulder clues the audience in on 
his fascination with aliens, but 
also hints at the psychological 
ennui that will be revealed later 
in the episode. As pictures of UFO 
crashes and monstrous aliens flip 
across the screen, Mulder sounds 
bored and disengaged. He sounds 
a far cry from the passionate zealot 
that fans remember from the pre-
vious series: “We must ask our-
selves … Are they really a hoax?” 
He doesn’t sound convinced. Just 
like that, the viewer’s curiosity is 

piqued, and Duchovny has sent us 
on a mission to figure out what’s 
wrong with Mulder.

Sure enough, Mulder has grown 

depressed and worse for the wear 
since the X-Files division closed. 
Without his passions or his case 
partner to guide him, Mulder’s 
belief is waning. Duchovny is 
game for this graying and cyni-
cal character bent, but he keeps 
a spark of the bright old Mulder 
in his performance. This spark 
intensifies whenever he shares 
the screen with his former part-
ner, Dana Scully (Gillian Ander-
son, “The Fall”). In the years since 
we’ve last seen her, Scully also 
appears to have grown colder and 
more cynical (though this might 
be the aftermath of Anderson’s 
brilliantly detached “Hannibal” 
performance). Thankfully, the two 
jump right back into their gently 
combative relationship, and Mul-
der sets a million ’shipper hearts 
aflame when he cracks a sly smile 
and tells Scully “Don’t pretend I’m 
going alone.”

But even great performers can’t 

save bad writing. The miniseries’ 
new case is frustratingly scattered 
across the episode’s 43-minute 
runtime. 
Political 
conspiracist 

talk show host Tad O’Malley (Joel 
McHale, “Community”) inspires 
Mulder and Scully to investigate 
Sveta (Annet Mahendru, “The 
Americans”) ’s claims that she 
was abducted by aliens, has alien 
DNA and had aliens hole-punch 
circles in her abdomen. Despite 
Mahendru’s best efforts, Sveta is 
a ridiculous character, made even 
more so by the fact that Mulder is 
convinced she is the “key to every-
thing” and just a few minutes of 
her testimony is enough to make 
him question his entire worldview. 
The introductions feel rushed, and 
the episode doesn’t spend enough 
time dissecting Mulder’s weak-
ened beliefs or desperation to jus-
tify this sudden switch.

The episode also suffers from 

some horrific dialogue writ-
ing and direction — bad even by 
the standards of a show that has 
never been known for its subtle 
character work. In one scene that 
takes place on Mulder’s porch, 
Scully and her former partner 
utter every “X-Files” poster epi-
thet within the span of two min-
utes: “You want to believe! You 
so badly want to believe!” “I do 
believe!” “The truth is out there, 
Scully, and Tad O’Malley is gonna 
broadcast it!” As Mulder and 
Scully trade fan-service quotes, 
they grip the other’s shoulders 
and shout with their faces inch-
es from one another. Of course, 
Sveta is standing right at the door 
watching them, and interrupts to 
ask if everything is OK. I laughed 
out loud. It’s not OK.

I really want to believe that 

“The X-Files” will get back on 
track and deliver five great epi-
sodes after this middling pre-
miere. I want to believe that the 
reboot isn’t back solely for nos-
talgia’s sake, for money or for 
network ratings. I want Mulder 
to make sense again, for the Ciga-
rette Smoking Man to scare me 
shitless and for the story to jus-
tify the fact that “The X-Files” 
was pulled back out of the cabinet 
drawer and resurrected from the 
dead. “My Struggle” doesn’t quite 
live up to the heights set by previ-
ous seasons or merit the reboot on 
its own terms, but it’s worth hold-
ing out hope that the show will 
justify its own existence. After all, 
we’ve still got five episodes — and 
the truth is out there.

‘Angie Tribeca’ is 
almost too crazy

Rashida Jones 

helms a send-up of 

crime shows

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Considering the abundance 

of crime-based shows on Amer-
ican television, it seems almost 
implausible 
that networks 
keep creating 
more. In fact, 
most of these 
programs, 
such as “CSI” 
and “Law & 
Order,” are so 
common 
and 

similar 
that 

their 
closed 

narrative sto-
rylines, suspenseful plots and 
tough as nails protagonists have 
become 
predictable 
tropes. 

With TBS’s newest comedy 
“Angie Tribeca,” these shows 
receive the ultimate satirical 
treatment, though its conflict-
ing cleverness and stupidity 
come with some repercussions. 

Created by Steve Carell (“The 

Big Short”) and his wife Nancy 
Carell (“Bridesmaids”), “Angie 
Tribeca” is an ordinary buddy 
cop show disguised as a surreal, 
absurdist parody more in the 
vein of “The Naked Gun” and 
“Police Squad!” than “Brook-
lyn Nine-Nine.” It matches 
the traits of any other crime 
show, from the cookie-cutter 
characters to the over-the-top 
cases. The only difference is 
“Angie Tribeca” is incredibly 
self-aware of its own exagger-
ated nature and offers several 
obvious references to crime cli-
chés, such as its title sequence: 
a dizzyingly, fast-paced mon-
tage backed by the sound of a 
screaming man.

But while “Angie Tribeca” 

can be overwhelmingly droll at 

times, it contains a plethora of 
brilliant attributes, especially 
with Rashida Jones as its win-
ning lead. Following up her 
role as Ann Perkins on NBC’s 
critically acclaimed “Parks & 
Recreation,” Jones plays the 
title character, a no-nonsense 
female 
cop 
archetype 
who 

retains both an unwavering 
conviction to seek justice and a 
wacky personality. Think Oliv-
ia Benson from “Law & Order: 
SVU,” but younger and sillier. 
Her partner is Jay Geils (Hayes 
MacArthur, “She’s Out of My 
League”), a handsome male cop 
archetype who is also just as 
strange and committed to fight-
ing crime as Tribeca is. The two 
bring down bad guys together 
and form a friendly, ambiguous 
relationship, which is typical of 
most crime shows. Regardless 
of how easily they draw from 
other leading roles in crime 
shows, Jones and MacArthur 
have actual great comedic and 
romantic chemistry.

Like its two leads, most of 

the characters in “Angie Tribe-
ca” poke fun at crime show 
stereotypes 
but 
have 
their 

own distinctively odd quirks. 
Jere Burns (“Justified”) is the 
hard-around-the-edges LAPD 
lieutenant Chet Atkins; Alfred 
Molina (“Love Is Strange”) 
plays the LAPD’s forensics 
pathologist Dr. Edelweiss, who 
starts out each episode physi-
cally disabled and then seems 
perfectly fine in the end; Deon 
Cole (“Black-ish”) is DJ Tanner, 
a fierce cop with a German shep-

herd sidekick. Along with the 
cast is an exhaustingly talented 
list of cameos that includes Lisa 
Kudrow 
(“Friends”), 
James 

Franco (“Palo Alto”), Adam 
Scott (“Parks & Rec”), Sarah 
Chalke (“Scrubs”) and ventrilo-
quist Jeff Dunham (“Dinner for 
Schmucks”).

“Angie Tribeca” ’s reliance 

on satirizing conventions of 
crime shows is both its big-
gest strength and weakness. 
Many of the show’s gags are 
hysterical 
and 
gut-busting, 

though they can easily become 
tiresome after watching them 
over and over again. A perfect 
example is a recurring visual 
gag of the Ford logo in the pilot 
episode, which appears in every 
scene with a Ford car and even 
some scenes that don’t. The 
overtly obvious product place-
ment seems funny, but it’s like 
repeating the same joke every 
10 minutes — it may sound 
hilarious at first, but when 
told too many times, it’s essen-
tially beating a dead horse. Of 
course, that’s not to say that 
there aren’t moments of fan-
tastic wit, the strongest being 
its spoof of classic crime show 
conventions, such as dramatic 
flashbacks, over-the-top action 
sequences and insanely wild 
cases. One delves into the mys-
terious death of a wedding cake 
baker and another investigates 
a missing painting of a thumb.

Instead of using the conven-

tional week-by-week episode 
format, TBS showed the entire 
first season of “Angie Tribeca” 
in a back-to-back marathon. 
Though it made for an inter-
esting marketing move, the 
show is much easier to watch 
in smaller doses. At its worst, 
“Angie Tribeca” is an aggravat-
ing half-hour comedy that’s too 
repetitive for its own good. But 
at its best, “Angie Tribeca” is an 
intelligent, amusing satire that 
boasts a view on how the crime 
genre can be both captivating 
and utterly outrageous.

‘M’ goes 3-2 in California

No. 12 Michigan 
plays three top-10 
teams, knocks off 

No. 8 San Jose State

By BILLY STAMPFL

Daily Sports Writer

Tough competition and hard-

fought matches highlighted an 
overall successful weekend for 
the Michigan women’s water 
polo team, which won three of 
its five games in Santa Barbara 
to open the 2016 season. Three 
of those matches pitted the 
12th-ranked Wolverines against 
teams in the top eight nationally.

“I feel like we got tested,” said 

coach Marcelo Leonardi. “We 
used it as a measurement to see 
where we’re at as a team, and 
overall I think we performed 
pretty well.”

Though the weekend began 

on a somewhat sour note with 
an 11-10 loss to No. 7 Hawaii — a 
game in which Rainbow Wahine 
sophomore 
Nikki-Marie 
Bell 

scored the game-winning goal 
with just three seconds left — 
Michigan rebounded in its next 
match, defeating No. 19 Cal State 
Northridge by a score of 12-4. 

The Wolverines carried their 

momentum forward, winning 
two 
more 
games 
Saturday 

afternoon and Sunday morning 
— which included a rout of No. 
24 Cal Baptist and a stellar 
offensive performance against 
No. 8 San Jose State in which 
Michigan won, 18-9. But the 
Wolverines’ run was cut short, 
as they fell to No. 2 UCLA, 
11-7, in the final game of the 
weekend. 

Despite 
the 
loss 
to 
the 

powerhouse 
Bruins, 
Leonardi 

praised his team, especially senior 
Ali Thomason, as they prepared to 
head back to Ann Arbor.

“I have to give props — 

(Thomason) had a fantastic 
weekend,” Leonardi said. “She’s 
not just a scorer. She’s doing it on 
both sides of the pool.”

Though 
Leonardi 
always 

appreciates 
the 
efforts 
of 

Thomason and the rest of an 
experienced 
core, he also 
acknowledged 
the 
contributions 
his 
younger 

players made. 
The 
second-

year coach is 
introducing 
his 
first 

recruiting 
class this season.

“Our freshmen all played 

quality minutes almost every 
single game,” Leonardi said. “I 
expect the front string that I’ve 

recruited to come in and make 
an immediate impact, which 
they did.”

In Friday’s opening contest, 

four Wolverines made their 
collegiate 
debut, 
including 

freshman Kim Johnson, who 
started all five games to begin 

her Michigan 
career.

“In my very 

first 
game, 

there 
were 

some jitters,” 
Johnson said. 
“But 
overall 

I don’t really 
get butterflies 
— I just get 
excited. 
I 

mostly get pumped up by the 
close games and the excitement 
of it all.”

If 
any 
anxiety 
existed, 

Johnson seemed to eradicate 

it fairly quickly, scoring three 
goals each in three of her first 
four games and finishing with 
a total of 12 goals in the five 
matches combined.

Johnson’s 
comfort 
and 

immediate impact are perhaps 
a product of having her older 
sister, Danielle, a junior, on the 
team as well. The two last played 
together in high school, and have 
always had great chemistry.

“It’s so much fun having 

her here,” Kim Johnson said. 
“Danielle is my best friend, and 
we have a great dynamic in the 
water. I’m so happy we ended up 
at Michigan together.”

Leonardi should be happy, 

too, as the Wolverines are off to 
a fast start in 2016. Chemistry, 
not just between the Johnson 
sisters but throughout the team 
as a whole, certainly has had 
something to do with it.

WRESTLING
Bruno, Pantaleo 
stand out in wins

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

Much has been made in recent 

weeks about the No. 8 Michigan 
wrestling 
team’s 
“Murderer’s 

Row,” as sixth-year senior Max 
Huntley called it. 

The 
term 
refers 
to 
the 

Wolverines’ 
184-pound, 
197-

pound 
and 
heavyweight 

wrestlers — junior Domenic 
Abounader, Huntley and junior 
Adam Coon, respectively. All 
three are undefeated in dual 
play and were as strong as ever 
in Michigan’s 22-12 victory over 
No. 19 Central Michigan on 
Friday and its 33-6 win against 
No. 21 Indiana on Sunday.

While 
their 
contributions 

have been crucial to Michigan’s 
success, they are not the only 
ones propelling the Wolverines 
to victory.

Some of the lighter-weight 

wrestlers 
have 
shined 
for 

Michigan as of late. Senior Rossi 
Bruno (6-2 in dual-meet play) at 
133 pounds and sophomore Alec 
Pantaleo (7-1) at 149 pounds 
have stood out, especially over 
the weekend.

“Our guys did a great job of 

scoring points,” said Michigan 
coach Joe McFarland. “(The fans) 
come for a lot of action and guys 
scoring points, and we did a great 
job of that today.”

Bruno, who entered Friday’s 

match ranked No. 17 in the 
country, began the weekend 
with a 4-2 overtime win over 
the Chippewas’ Corey Keener. 
Bruno scored an escape point 
late in the third period to force 
overtime 
and 
was 
quickly 

awarded 
a 
bout-winning 

takedown in the extra period.

He continued his winning 

ways Sunday with a 15-2 major-
decision 
victory 
over 
the 

Hoosiers’ 
Alonzo 
Shepherd. 

Bruno broke open his match 
in the second period with a 
takedown and a near fall to 
go ahead 8-0. The triumph 
proved momentum-shifting as it 
followed a close loss by redshirt 
junior Conor Youtsey, 5-4, at the 
hands of Indiana’s Elijah Oliver 
at 125-pounds.

“I thought I wrestled hard, 

but there’s always places to 
improve on,” Bruno said. “So I 
don’t think I had two perfect 
matches, but definitely two 
steps in the right direction.”

Pantaleo, meanwhile, showed 

why he entered the weekend 
ranked sixth at 149 pounds. He 
came out Friday with a 10-4 win 
over Central Michigan’s Colin 
Heffernan to put the Wolverines 
in front, 9-3. Pantaleo buoyed 
himself with a near fall and two 
takedowns in the second period.

Sunday proved to be almost no 

different for Pantaleo. He used 
a three-point third period to 
top Indiana’s Luke Blanton, 7-2. 
Pantaleo’s victory gave Michigan 
a 10-3 lead at the time.

“When I step on the mat, I 

want to dominate everyone I 
wrestle,” Pantaleo said.

With a matchup at No. 1 Penn 

State looming on Jan. 31, the 
Wolverines will be looking for 
any matchup advantage they can 
find, especially those outside 
of their “Murderer’s Row.” But 
Bruno said he feels Michigan can 
draw off its experience from its 
21-11 win at then-No. 6 Ohio State 
on Jan. 9 and be up for the Nittany 
Lions’ challenge.

“We’re just going to keep doing 

the things we’ve been doing,” 
Bruno said. “The big thing is not 
letting the hype of Penn State 
get to us. If we can model the 
execution we had (against Ohio 
State), we should be good.”

‘M’ uses home-court advantage

By ORION SANG

Daily Sports Writer

The tension in the air was 

palpable as all eyes fixed upon 
center court.

With a win from senior Ronit 

Yurovsky, the No. 14 Michigan 
women’s tennis team would 
win its match against No. 24 
Kentucky and guarantee a berth 
in the ITA Indoor Championship.

As 
the 
match 
reached 
a 

tiebreaker in the second set, 
Yurovsky’s teammates gathered 
on the courts around her and 
began 
to 
cheer 
louder 
and 

louder. The crowd at the Varsity 
Tennis Center made its presence 
heard as well, with shouts of 
encouragement.

When Yurovsky ripped off five 

straight points to win her match 
and give the Wolverines the dual-
meet victory, the noise reached a 
crescendo.

The crowd erupted, and her 

teammates rushed onto to the 
court.

For Michigan, this is as much a 

part of the game as what actually 
occurs on the court.

“When I’m the last one on the 

court, it doesn’t feel like I’m alone 
because (my teammates are) all 
standing there,” Yurovsky said. 
“It’s huge having them cheering 
me on, and it makes the opponent 
even more nervous.”

Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 

Bernstein 
recognizes 
the 

importance of staying together 
as a team, and 
encourages 
her players to 
make an effort 
to cheer each 
other on, even 
while isolated 
in tight singles 
matches.

“I 
don’t 

want them to 
be 
on 
their 

own 
court,” 

Bernstein said. “I think it’s really 
important that as people play 
next to them that they show 
support. That’s the beauty of 
college tennis: It’s a team thing. 

Even if you’re struggling or doing 
well, you can still help the person 
next to you.”

Freshman 
Kate 
Fahey 
is 

appreciative 
of 
the 
support 

and also knows lending it is 
something she can work on.

“I’ve struggled with that a 

little in the beginning of the 
season because I’m not used to 
it,” Fahey said. “You’re not used 
to cheering on other people, but 

it really helps 
the 
team. 

When I get in 
a rut and I’m 
not winning a 
lot of points, 
cheering 
on 

my teammates 
helps me and 
takes my mind 
off my match.”

And though 

tennis is not 

as much of a spectator sport as 
football or basketball, Michigan 
has 
a 
distinct 
home-court 

advantage whenever it plays at 
the Varsity Tennis Center.

The Wolverines consistently 

draw fans at their competitions, 
and a certain group of fans attend 
almost every match.

“I’m not used to playing in 

front of that many people,” 
Fahey said. “The fans have 
been awesome. You see the 
same people here every time 
and familiar faces when you 
look up, and it’s just such a good 
feeling when you win a point 
because it’s not just you cheering 
for yourself, but also your 
teammates and fans.”

With three of its next four 

competitions at home, Michigan 
hopes to start its season strong in 
front of its fans.

“We’ve 
been 
pretty 

successful at home,” Bernstein 
said. “I think we get great 
crowds, and they definitely 
helped us through today. We’ve 
got another big match coming 
up next Sunday, so hopefully 
we get another big crowd again. 
The girls like playing at home 
in front of the home crowd, and 
today was no different.”

MEN’S GYMNASTICS
Mistakes ruin 
home opener

Wolverines struggle 
in several events vs. 

No. 1 Oklahoma

By ETHAN WOLFE 

Daily Sports Writer

Going into Saturday’s meet 

against No. 1 Oklahoma, the 
Michigan 
men’s 
gymnastics 

team knew it would be up 
against elite competition. And 
the 
10th-ranked 
Wolverines 

(0-4 Big Ten, 1-5 overall) didn’t 
help themselves either, as they 
seemed to be their own enemies.

In a meet where the Sooners 

(2-0 Big 12, 5-0) were able to 
pull away quickly, Michigan’s 
16.550-point defeat was the 
result of a number of critical 
mistakes.

A bevy of the Wolverines’ 

mistakes came on the pommel 
horse — the only event in 
which Oklahoma does not lead 
the nation. It was crucial for 
Michigan to capitalize, but 
three Wolverines fell off and 
had to restart their routines. It 
was Michigan’s lowest-scoring 
event on the day and the only 
one in which they failed to 
amass 70 points.

Freshman 
Anthony 

McCallum, who shined for the 
Wolverines in his first collegiate 
meet last week, struggled for the 
entire meet. He had the lowest 
score for two events, including 
the pommel horse, in which 
he didn’t complete his routine, 
scoring a 10.000.

Michigan’s woes continued 

on 
the 
parallel 
bars. 

Despite 
showing 
significant 

improvement from the Windy 
City Invitational the previous 
week, scoring 15 more points, 
the Wolverines were unable to 
stick a number of dismounts.

Michigan coach Kurt Golder 

was not pleased with the team’s 
performance, but he saw a lot of 
potential.

“If we can eliminate the 

big mistakes and get our hit 
percentage from 70-75 percent 
up to 80-85 percent, that’s 
approaching 
championship 

form,” Golder said. “We have 
to increase our difficulty, too. 
The routines that these guys are 
doing may not look easy, but by 
our championship standards, 
some of them are easy.

“We expect to get better, and 

if you see the same, you’re not 
pleased with that.”

Sophomore Dmitri Belanovski 

had the best performance on 
the night for the Wolverines, but 
even he could not avoid mistakes 
against Oklahoma. Though the 
meet was out of reach by the final 
event, the high bar, Belanovski 
held a slight lead to be the all-
around champion. But Belanovski 
lost his grip in the middle of his 
routine, finishing with a 13.800 
and an 86.950 overall, good for 
third place all-around.

“I was a little nervous on 

high bar,” Belanovski said. “I 
think high bar is my best event, 
so I get a little nervous for it. 
That release is new for me, so 
I’ve got to keep being more 
confident in it.”

For a team that consists mostly 

of freshmen, confidence is a 
necessity. Golder believes that 
will develop over time, and that 
the main concern is being too 
careful. His advice was simple.

“Just attack it,” Golder said. 

“I think they might be a little 
consumed with making sure 
everything is perfect and they’re 
swinging a little bit cautiously, 
and they don’t practice that way. 
If you fall, then you fall. But 
you’ve got to compete the way 
you practice.”

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

suffered another hit in the 
loss column, both Belanovski 
and 
Golder 
shared 
the 

same 
sentiment: 
a 
15-point 

improvement against the No. 
1 team in the country isn’t 
something to worry about.

Wolverines prep 
for loud road test 
at Pegula Arena

Michigan working 
on defense, getting 
healthier heading 
into State College

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

Before the Big Ten’s “Super 

Saturday” in New York City, the 
No. 6 Michigan hockey team 
will travel to 
State 
College 

to take on No. 
15 Penn State in a big matchup of 
two teams vying for the Big Ten 
regular-season title.

But at the Pegula Ice Arena, 

a hockey rink known for its 
raucous crowd, the Wolverines 
will have their hands full.

The arena, capable of fitting 

5,782 fans, was built three 
years ago, aligning with the 
Nittany 
Lions’ 
inaugural 

season in Division I. The rink’s 
construction was made possible 
by Terry and Kim Pegula, who 
also own the Buffalo Bills of 
the National Football League 
and the Buffalo Sabres of the 
National Hockey League.

Led by The Roar Zone, which 

is Penn State’s hockey student 
section, the loud fans give the 
Nittany Lions an advantage at 
every home game, especially 
this season. Penn State is 11-3-
1 on home ice in its 2015-16 
campaign so far.

“It’s 
a 
loud 
rink,” 
said 

senior forward Justin Selman. 
“Definitely a rink we want to 
keep quiet. We need to get a 
good start and keep them down. 
They’re pretty loud when they 
score goals there, just like 
the student section at Yost, so 
they’re going to look to use that 
to their advantage.”

FIRST 
LINE 
SUCCESS: 

Since the first line of junior 
forwards Tyler Motte and JT 
Compher and freshman forward 
Kyle Connor was formed after 
Thanksgiving break, the trio 
has been on a tear. The line 
has combined for 64 points in 
10 games, and both Connor 
and Motte are tied for second 
nationally in goals with 18.

One reason Michigan coach 

Red Berenson thinks the line 
has played so well has been 
due to Connor switching from 
his spot on the right wing on 
the second line to his natural 
position of left wing.

Connor has been the perfect 

fit on a line in which everyone 
brings something different to 
the table.

But no one has been able to 

pinpoint one reason why the line 
has played so well.

“I don’t know if there’s one 

thing,” Motte said. “We all bring 
something different to the line. I 
think that’s really what it is. We 
don’t overthink things. We just 
go out and play hockey.

“It’s 
worked 
well 
with 

Connor’s 
skill, 
his 
ability 

to 
make 
plays 
and 
finish 

opportunities. JT’s grinding 
ability, he’s a good two-way 
center man, helps a lot in 
the D-zone and on faceoffs. 
 

(Compher’s) ability to make 
plays is unbelievable, and I 
just try to give those guys the 
puck, and try to put away my 
opportunities when I get them.”

SHORING 
UP 
THE 

DEFENSE: With the offense 
playing as well as it has been, 
the Wolverines have been able to 
skate by with a set of blueliners 
that ranks No. 44 in the nation 
defensively.

But blame can be spread out 

across all players.

For offensive players especially, 

the 
Wolverines 
have 
been 

working on clearing rebounds.

“We gotta get rid of second-

chance opportunities,” Motte 
said. “We need to really bear 
down, box guys out in front of 
the net. When our goalies are 
making tough saves and that 
rebound’s laying there, we gotta 
be able to clear it out, get it into 
the corner.”

Another 
area 
Berenson 

noticed the Wolverines could 
improve 
after 
their 
series 

against Ohio State was the 
penalty kill.

Michigan killed off only one 

of four power plays against the 
Buckeyes.

“I thought our penalty killing 

(was) not as good as it needed to 
be,” Berenson said. “I thought 
our goals against — there was 
one or two that we could’ve got 
back. There were too many goals 
against on the weekend.”

INJURY UPDATES: During 

Michigan’s 
exhibition 
game 

against 
the 
United 
States 

National 
Team 
Development 

Program on Thursday, Berenson 
sat sophomore defenseman Zach 
Werenski with a bruising injury 
and freshman forward Cooper 
Marody, who was sick.

Marody is still out with 

sickness, but Werenski practiced 
Monday and will be in the lineup 
this weekend.

In addition, Connor slammed 

hard into the boards during the 
exhibition and didn’t play for 
the remainder of the game.

However, Connor will practice 

Tuesday and will be ready to play 
against the Nittany Lions.

Senior 
defenseman 
Kevin 

Lohan was also practicing with 
the team Monday, and Berenson 
said that he has a good chance 
to play this weekend. If Lohan 
does return, he will help a 
defense that will be missing 
sophomore defenseman Cutler 
Martin, who is suspended for 
the 
weekend 
following 
his 

involvement in the brawl after 
Michigan’s second game against 
Ohio State. Sophomore forward 
Dexter Dancs is suspended for 
just Thursday’s game for his 
part in the brawl.

NOTEBOOK

Walton, Wolverines adjust to 
opposing looks on perimeter

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

As wins go, the Michigan men’s 

basketball 
team’s 
Wednesday 

squeaker over Minnesota was an 
underwhelming one. The Golden 
Gophers entered Crisler Center at 
0-6 in the Big Ten, having already 
suffered 
three 
conference 

losses by double-digit margins. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
Wolverines 

failed to put Minnesota away 
until the game’s final minutes and 
struggled to shoot the basketball 
all night, finishing just shy of 37 
percent from the field.

After that game, and again 

after Michigan’s 81-68 win at 
Nebraska on Saturday, Michigan 
coach John Beilein and the 
centerpieces of the Wolverines’ 
backcourt-centric offense offered 
the 
same 

explanation for 
their periodic 
struggles.

In 
both 

games, 
Michigan’s 
options on ball 
screens — one 
of its offensive 
staples — were 
limited in ways 
they hadn’t been at any point 
this season. In an attack heavily 
reliant on the 3-pointer, any 
impediment to the Wolverines’ 
perimeter ball screens presents a 
major roadblock. 

“I knew they were going to 

be challenging for us because 
of 
their 
overall 
quickness,” 

Beilein said after the win against 
Minnesota. “They defended (the 
ball screen) differently than 
anybody has defended it all year 
long. I’m not going to put it out 
there, but we’ve got to have a 
different strategy or be better at 
what we do.”

Ever 
cryptic, 
Beilein 
did 

little more to walk the average 

basketball mind through the 
mechanics of what Nebraska 
and Minnesota did on the 
defensive end. Some aspects of 
the defensive efforts, however, 
were 
apparent. 
The 
Golden 

Gophers employed an atypically 
nimble set of low-post defenders 
on ball-screen switches, stifling 
the room Michigan’s shooters 
typically 
enjoy. 
Nebraska, 

meanwhile, made sure not to 
leave the post-screen trailer 
with any space at all.

“Going in, we knew that they 

guarded the ball screen a certain 
way — they didn’t really allow us 
to throw it back to what we call the 
‘bulldog’ guy for the open jumper,” 
said junior guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. of the Cornhuskers. 

While Nebraska’s consistent 

perimeter pressure closed doors 

for open jump 
shots 
from 

range, 
the 

Wolverines 
took 
advantage 
once 
they 

found 
room 

on the other 
side 
of 
the 

wall. Walton, 
passing 

through height on the perimeter, 
made 
sure 
the 
ball-screen 

pressure translated to more room 
on the inside, particularly for 
junior forward Mark Donnal on 
the pick-and-roll. 

“Mark 
was 
setting 
great 

screens all night and rolling as 
fast as possible,” Walton said. 
“He made my job a lot easier. At 
that point, all I had to do was give 
him the ball and let him do what 
he does.”

Walton’s 
six 
total 
assists 

helped Donnal to a 14-point 
effort, his third double-digit 
scoring performance in seven Big 
Ten games. Since his 26-point 
outburst against Illinois on Jan. 2, 

Donnal is averaging 12 points and 
has been markedly more involved 
in the Wolverines’ offense.

“As Derrick said, we knew they 

were going to play a certain way 
on ball screens,” Donnal said, 
“so there were some open passes 
that he was able to make (that) I 
converted on once I could.”

The 
Wolverines 
certainly 

did better capitalizing in the 
interior against Nebraska, but 
the added perimeter pressure 
prevented redshirt sophomore 
guard Duncan Robinson from 
getting the type of looks he 
has grown accustomed to from 
3-point range.

Robinson shot just 3-for-10 

from beyond the arc during the 

Minnesota game, but Beilein saw 
a silver lining in his long-range 
struggles. Tailed nonstop around 
the perimeter, Robinson’s off-
ball movement has taken a major 
leap, as has his ability to finish at 
the rim.

“What he’s realizing now is 

that people are going to play 
him a certain way, and his 
movement without the ball is 
going to be really important,” 
Beilein said Saturday after 
watching 
him 
make 
three 

2-point shots. “He’s learning 
— all the video, all the synergy 
— that people are going to sit on 
him different ways, and he’s got 
to do more than stand and wait 
for people to get him open.”

Derrick Walton Jr. has adapted to opponents’ focus on Michigan’s ball screens.

were going to play

Freshman center Hallie Thome has developed as one of Michigan’s best offensive threats, but she is still working on improving her defense in the low post.

Thome’s defense still developing

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

Hallie Thome is 6-foot-5, but 

she still has room to grow.

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball 
team’s 
freshman 

center isn’t having her way with 
opponents like she did throughout 
the non-conference schedule.

The “pass her the ball, she 

can’t miss” trend hasn’t slowed 
down, but Thome’s unlucky 
tendency to get into foul trouble 
in important games is haunting 
the Wolverines.

Sunday’s 93-81 defeat against 

Nebraska 
was 
Michigan’s 

worst loss so far in the Big Ten. 
After giving up 21 points to the 
Cornhuskers in the first five 
minutes, the Wolverines stormed 
back to nearly tie the game early 
in the third quarter. A few minutes 
later, the Cornhuskers had again 
widened the lead to 10, and Thome 
collected her fourth personal foul. 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
took her off the court.

Before the end of the quarter, 

Nebraska would extend that lead 
to 17.

Thome 
finished 
with 
an 

impressive 
24 
points, 
two 

blocks and six rebounds, but 
she also fouled out of the game, 
leaving Nebraska’s strong post 
presence unmatched for most of 
the final quarter.

The Cornhuskers, much like 

No. 5 Maryland did on Jan. 14, 
put Thome in difficult matchups. 
Thome accumulated four fouls 
going up against the Terrapins’ 
center Brionna Jones and wasn’t 
able to have as much of an impact 
as Michigan would’ve liked, 
scoring 15 points, but grabbing 
just five boards.

Thome has been clutch at times 

with her offensive consistency, 
but the Wolverines’ (3-5 Big Ten, 
11-8 overall) problems arise when 
she starts to rack up fouls.

“Hallie’s 
a 
heck 
of 
a 

freshman,” Barnes Arico said. 
“And hopefully over the course 
of Hallie’s career, she’s going 
to continue to improve and 
continue to be a better defender 

and rebounder.”

Thome 
has 
averaged 
15.1 

points 
and 
six 
rebounds 

through 
the 
opening 
eight 

games of the Big Ten season. 
She 
scores 
profusely, 
ranks 

second nationally in field-goal 
percentage at 64.8 percent and 
wins almost every opening tip.

Since the season opener, the 

Wolverines have been able to rely 
on her. Against then-No. 20 UCLA, 
she put up a career-high 24 points 
and seven rebounds. She then had 
her second career double-double 
against No. 7 Ohio State with 21 
points and 12 rebounds.

She has developed a strong 

touch around the rim, and she 
continues to impress with her 
spinning peel-back moves around 
the basket. Thome has been the 
tallest one on the court in every 
game this season, but adapting 
to the gritty toughness that some 
of her opponents possess has 
proven to be difficult.

“We need to be tougher on 

the glass,” said senior guard 
Madison Ristovski. “We gave up 

a lot of offensive rebounds.”

Added junior guard Siera 

Thompson: “I think we just 
need to get tougher all the way 
around. Not giving them second-
chance points.”

That word “tougher” comes 

up a lot when talking about 
rebounds, and at the center of it 
all is Thome.

Michigan’s competition seems 

to have picked up on the formula 
to taking down the Wolverines’ 
towering 6-foot-5 center.

Let Thome touch the ball in 

the post, and she will probably 
score on you. Isolate her in the 
post when she is on defense, and 
there’s a decent chance you will 
go to the charity stripe.

Largely due to Thome’s ability 

to dominate at the ‘5’ spot, 
Michigan ran out of the gates 
this season with a record-tying 
seven straight wins. Since then, 
the Wolverines have gone 4-8.

They will need Thome to 

regain 
the 
dominance 
she 

exhibited so many times if they 
want to win down the stretch.
