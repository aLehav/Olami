Administrators:
Coleman will leave
an impressive legacy
of achievements
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily StaffReporter
With great power comes great
responsibility - a mantra Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man knows all too well.
As Coleman pre-
pares to step down July
2014, the responsibil-
ity for finding a new
president will fall on
the eight members of
the University's Board Filling I
of Regents and seven
faculty members, who
form the Presidential Search
Advisory Committee. The com-
mittee, assisted by Alison Ran-
ney, a search consultant from
Russell Reynolds Associates,

has just concluded a series of six
public forums to answer several
key questions: What qualities are
desired in the next University
president? What opportunities
and challenges lie in store for the
University?
Coleman has left an indelible
mark during her nearly 12 years
at the University - its longest
serving president since Harlan
Hatcher retired in 1967 after 16
years at the helm. In Coleman's
time as president, she has been
called upon to serve
in a number of roles,
including fundraiser-
in-chief, diplomat
for the University on
an increasing global
stage, facilitator of
emming change, advocate for
the University at all
levels of government
and symbolic leader of all three
University of Michigan cam-
puses. Her successor will need to
assume all those roles and more

Supercomputer
is at center of
growing institute
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
There's a computer on North
Campus that's about 10,000
times more powerful than a

MacBook.
University researchers can
use it to simulate infectious dis-
ease outbreaks and investigate
problems in nuclear reactors. It
takes an hour to assess data that
would require a month for a typ-
ical computer.
This supercomputer could
have implications beyond its
location in an engineering
research center - it's the nucle-

us of the recently established
Michigan Institute for Compu-
tational Discovery and Engi-
neering.
MICDE intends to bring
together fields that use com-
putational simulation in their
research, said Eric Michielssen,
chemical engineering professor
and MICDE director. The insti-
tute is affiliated with 40 faculty
from the College of Engineering

and School of Information, both
sponsors of MICDE.
Michielssen said a multidis-
ciplinary atmosphere is ideal for
innovation, which will be aug-
mented by MICDE's seminars
and courses.
"A number of ideas are actu-
ally generated by people just
interacting in an unorganized
fashion," he said. "Ideas never

Students create

HOT DOG!

Online database
to foster cross-
disciplinary
collaboration
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
For all but the most pedantic
readers, academic journals have
plenty of turn-offs. The language
is technical. The concepts are
intangible. The topics are niche.
But a group of University doc-
toral fellows wants to change
that.
Fellows from the University's
Graham Sustainability Institute
have launched an online jour-
nal - the Michigan Journal of
Sustainability - designed to
improve the accessibility of con-
tent and foster cross-disciplin-
ary collaboration. With online
access and no subscription fees,

the publication's creators hope
academic sustainability research
will be easier to conduct and
understand.
Theperiodical is aimed at a
wide variety of readers, includ-
ing academics, policymakers,
students and concerned citizens
- the people most likely to use
the science that researchers are
uncovering.
"In other words, the MJS
puts sustainability science in the
hands of those who can use it,"
the journal's website states.
Nicholas Rajkovich, the jour-
nal's editor-in-chief and a Gra-
ham Doctoral fellow, said the
publication's format places spe-
cial emphasis on collecting work
from a wide array of academic
disciplines.
"Sustainability issues, by
nature, are interdisciplinary,"
Rajkovich said. "They require
input from a lot of different fields
to derive solutions. If you're writ-

In a quest to reduce waste in
a way that appeals to business
and consumer interests, Univer-
sity alumni Rich Grousset and
Raphael Meyer created Bizee-
box, a reusable takeout container
that can be sold to restaurants
and reused up to 350 times.
Grousset and Meyer say Ann

per year. Bizeebox could meet
the takeout demand with less

Officers seek off-campus justice

George Washington Univer-
sity has begun talks with other
Washington officials about
expanding police presence
beyond its campus, The GW
Hatchet reported Monday.
In doing so, they are follow-
ing in the steps of the University
of Maryland, Kent State Univer-

all of which have recently grant-

campus police, namely for the
purpose of

city police department.
David Martin, a criminal jus-
tice researcher at Wayne State,
told the Hatchet that city police
departments can often use the
help of university police forc-

es, and the trend of expanding
jurisdictions may continue.
"Policing is certainly headed
in this direction, as communi-
cations and technology have
improved greatly," he said.

Claims foul play
with economy and
power grid
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -
President Nicolas Maduro said
Tuesday that Venezuela will not
have cordial relations with the
United States as long as U.S. dip-
lomats continue what he alleges
are attempts to destabilize his
country.
He said "new points of con-
tact" can be established, but only
if Washington ends such activity.
Maduro's tough talk came
a day after he announced the
expulsion of the top U.S. dip-
lomat in Venezuela, Charge
d'Affaires Kelly Keiderling, and
two other embassy officials,
alleging they conspired with
"the extreme right" to sabotage
the economy and power grid.
The United States again on
Tuesday rejected the allegations
that it is tryingto destabilize this

South American nation.
State Department spokes-
woman Jen Psaki said Ven-
ezuela's government delivered
a diplomatic note to the U.S.
Embassy in Caracas on Monday
night that said it had declared
the U.S. charge d'affaires, the
political officer and the con-
sular officer personas non
grata. She said the three were
given 48 hours to leave Ven-
ezuela.
Psaki said the U.S. might take
reciprocal action in accordance
with the Vienna Convention on
diplomatic relations and on con-
sular relations but was still con-
sidering what action to take.
She said the allegations were
related to the U.S. Embassy
workers' travel to Bolivar state,
which is home to troubled state-
owned foundries and Venezu-
ela's main hydroelectric plant.
"They were there conduct-
ing normal diplomatic engage-
ment,. as we've said in the past
and should come as no surprise,"


Psaki said.
"We, of course, maintain reg-
ular contacts across the Venezu-
elan political spectrum. And we
maintain a broad perspective on
Venezuela and travel frequently,
of course. That's what diplomats
do. So there was nothing out of
the ordinary about that. And that
was part of their accusations,"
she said.
Expelled with Keiderling,
the top embassy official in the
absence of an ambassador, were
consular officer David Moo and
Elizabeth Hoffman, who works
in the embassy's political sec-
tion.
Speaking Tuesday from the
government palace, Maduro said
that "while the government of
the United States does notunder-
stand that it has to respect our
country's sovereignty there will
be simply be no cordial relations
nor cordial communication."
"The day that the government
of President (Barack) Obama
rectifies the situation we will
establish new points of contact


Exceptional
resources required
for upkeep of Rikers
NEW YORK (AP) - New York
is indeed an expensive place, but
experts say that alone doesn't
explain a recent report that
found the city's annual cost per
inmate was $167,731 last year -
nearly as much as it costs to pay
for four years of tuition at an Ivy
League university.
They say a big part of it is due
to New York's most notorious
lockup, Rikers Island, and the
costs that go along with staffing,
maintaining and securing a facil-
ity that is literally an island unto
itself
"Other cities don't have Rik-
ers Island," said Martin F. Horn,
who in 2009 resigned as the
city's correction commissioner,
notingthat hundreds of millions
of dollars are spent a year to run
the 400-acre island in the East
River next to the runways of

LaGuardia Airport that has 10
jail facilities, thousands of staff
and its ownpower plant and bak-
ery.
The city'stIndependent Budget
Office annual figure of $167,731-
which equates to about $460 per
day for the 12,287 average daily
New York City inmates last year
- was based on about $2 billion
in total operating expenses for
the Department of Correction,
which included salaries and
benefits for staff, judgments and
claims as well as debt service for
jail construction and repairs.
But there are particularly
expensive costs associated with
Rikers.
The departmentsays it spends
$30.3 million annually alone
on transportation costs, run-
ning three bus services that
usher inmates to and from court
throughout the five boroughs,
staff from a central parking lot
to Rikers jails and visitors to and
around the island. There were
261,158 inmates delivered to
court last year.


Awaytobringdownthe costs,
Horn has long said, would be to
replace Rikers Island with more
robust jails next door to court-
houses. But his .attempts to do
that failed in part because of
political opposition from resi-
dential areas near courthouses
in Brooklyn, Manhattan and
elsewhere.
"My point is: Have you seen a
whole lot of outcry on this? Why
doesn't anything happen?" Horn
said of the $167,731 annual figure.
"Because nobody cares."
"That's the reason we have
RikersIsland,"he said."We want
these guys put awayout of public
view."
New York's annual costs
dwarf the annual per-inmate
costs in other big cities. Los
Angeles spent $128.94 a day, or 4
$47,063 a year, for17,400 inmates
in fiscal year 2011-12, its sheriff's
office said. Chicago spent $145 a
day, or $52,925 a year, for 13,200
inmates in 2010.
Those costs included debt-ser-
vice and fringe benefits.

On Monday, state TV showed

BP executives defend spill response

Testified in trial they
avoided making the
crisis even worse
NEW ORLEANS (AP) -
A BP executive who led the
company's efforts to halt
its massive 2010 oil spill in
the Gulf of Mexico testified
Tuesday that his decisions
were guided by the principle
that they shouldn't do anything
that could make the crisis even
worse. .
James Dupree, BP's first
witness for the second phase
of a trial over the deadly
disaster, said his teams worked
simultaneously on several
strategies for killing the well
that blew out in April 2010.
Dupree said the company
scrapped plans to employ
a capping strategy in mid-
May because the equipment

wasn't ready. He also said he
was concerned that it could
jeopardize other efforts to seal
the well.
"We were very intent not to
make the situation worse," said
Dupree, who was promoted
to BP's regional president for
the Gulf of Mexico after the
spill was stopped. Dupree
is scheduled to resume his
testimony Wednesday.
BP's trial adversaries have
argued that the company could
have stopped the spill much
earlier than July 15 if it had
used the capping strategy.
Earlier Tuesday, an
employee of the company that
owned the doomed Deepwater
Horizon drilling rig testified
that he was surprised when BP
scrapped the capping strategy
his teamhad devised and never
heard an explanation for the
decision.
"We were so close. We had

come a long way," said Robert
Turlak, Transocean's manager
of subsea engineering and well
control systems.
During the first few weeks
after the spill, engineers
focused on two methods
for stopping the flow of oil:
Capping the well was one
option. The other, called "top
kill," involved pumping drilling
mud and other material into
the Deepwater Horizon rig's
blowout preventer.
BP ultimately used a capping
stack to stop the spill July 15
after several other methods
failed.
Turlak's team was working
on a strategy that was called
"BOP-on-BOP" because it
lowered a second blowout
preventer on top of the rig's
failed one. He called it the
"obvious solution" and said it
was ready for installation in
early June.

Feds defend plan
to drop gray wolf
protection
Federal officials offered a
staunch defense Monday of their
proposal to drop legal protec-
tions for the gray wolf in most of
the country, as opponents rallied
in the nation's capital before the
first in a series of public hearings
on the plan.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice called for removing the wolf
from the endangered species list
for the lower 48 states in June,
except for a subspecies called the
' Mexican wolf in the Southwest,
which is struggling to survive.
Ranching and hunting groups
have praised the proposal, while
environmentalists have said it is
premature.
COUNCIL
From Page 1A
Ward included incumbent Coun-
cilman Stephen Kunselman (D)
and Sam DeVarti, a challenger
from the newly formed Mixed-
Use Party. The two discussed
issues such as city cleaning,
regional bus systems, infrastruc-
ture maintenance and accessi-
bility in the downtown area.
Kunselman - a University
employee - recently pulled peti-
tions to run for mayor in 2014.
DiVarti, 23, said it was impor-
tant to for the city to consider
residents' impact on the envi-
ronment, citing his party's
enthusiasm about zoning plans.
The Mixed-Use Party states that
these zoning changes will allow
people to live in developed areas
near businesses to decrease air
pollution from vehicles and slow
construction on wilderness and
farm land.
"I propose some zoning
changes which I think are on
the cutting edge of urban plan-
ning; our ideas for a walking
downtown while still protecting
residences from high buildings I
think are spot on," DiVarti said.
Kunselaran placed more
emphasis on ethical governing,
highlighting his previous work
in public safety and infrastruc-
ture. To get active in the com-
munity, he said students should
know who the council members
are, participate in neighborhood
meetings and stay involved in
environmental issues.
"For students coming in and
(who are) only going to be here
for four years or five years,
(these issues) might not seem so
important to them, but they have
to remember that, at some point,
it may be them asking someone
else to take care of their neigh-
borhood," Kunselman said.
The 5th Ward candidates were
incumbent Mike Anglin (D) and
write-in candidate Thomas Par-
tridge.
Among his most prominent
stances, Anglin emphasized the
need for programs for children,

parks and recreation advance-
ment, and getting kids in school
by age 4. He said there needs to
be a "city center" like a park on
the undeveloped Library Lot.
Partridge, a University alum,
urged students to change their
driver's license addresses to
their Ann Arbor addresses if
they want to vote in the upcom-
ing election. One of his primary
concerns was to make life easier
for University students.
"We need affordable hous-
ing for students on campus, off
campus (and) affordable tuition
as well."

In an e-mail interview, Regent
Katherine White (D), vice chair
of the Board of Regents and act-
ing spokeswoman during the
search process, referred to a
list posted by the search com-
mittee detailing their expecta-
tions for potential candidates.
These include the ability to
serve as a national advocate and
spokesperson for the University,
increase racial and socioeco-
nomic diversity, address future
challenges, and be a model of
humility, integrity and passion
for student support.
The University has been the
beneficiary of three large dona-

The next president will have the
same opportunity and challenge
of engaging with University
alumni and potential donors.

rior interpersonal skills" that
are necessary for a University
president to be an effective fund-
raiser. Her passion for fundrais-
ing allows her to garner these
historic donations: renovations
and plans are already underway.
"She is very supportive of the
overall program of fundraising,"
May said. "She contributes to it,
and another way of being sup-
portive of it is that she works and
builds relationships with the most
generous donors in constituency
to the rest of the University."
Mayadded that he hopes-to
have a "seamless transition"
between the two presidents, as
Coleman's 12 years of relation-
ship-building will impact the
work of her successor.
"That's part of the seamless
transition down a long line," May
said. "You think of yourself as a
representative of the University as
opposed to central to everything."
The increasing importance of
fundraising is in part a result of
reduced state appropriation to
the University, May said. In the
midst of declining state appro-
priation, Gov. Rick Snyder pro-
posed a 2-percent increase for

higher-education funding for
this year's fiscal budget, add-
ing $30.7 million to Michigan's
$1.4-billion higher-education
budget. This jump follows a
3-percent increase from the year
before, improving from a 15-per-
cent drop for the 2012 fiscal year.
During her tenure, Coleman
has served as a cheerleader for
the institution, testifying in
Lansing for higher state appro-
priation and writing an open let-
ter to President Barack Obama
about the importance of higher-
education support. Coleman and
Obama certainly can agree on
one thing: affordability remains
one of the largest concerns fac-
ing higher education.
Cynthia Wilbanks, vice presi-
dent for government relations,
said she and Coleman have "a
strong partnership," and that
Coleman's work reflects that of
previous University presidents.
"The University of Michigan
has had a history of presidents
who have been willing to speak
up andspeak out about the impor-
tance ofhigher education issues of
the day,"Wilbanks said. "The Uni-
versity of Michigan is looked to as
a leader in providing really strong
advocacy for policies and funding
that supportcour mission."
To effectively work with the
state and federal government,
the University president needs
to create relationships with all
parts of the political spectrum,
ranging from members of Con-
gress to local elected officials,
Wilbanks said.
While Wilbanks said she
hopes state appropriations con-
tinue to increase and the fed-
eral government will refocus on
higher-education issues, afford-
ability stands at the forefront of
concerns for many at the Univer-
sity. The next president will face
budget constraints, and Univer-
sity Provost Martha Pollack said
she hopes this new leader starts
where Coleman leaves off.
In order to limit tuition
increases in the face of declin-
ing state support, the formula-
tion of the University's annual
budget and cost containment has
become a critical focus of the
University's administration and
of individual schools and col-
leges. Pollack said the next presi-
dent will need to immediately
face the persistent budget issues
and continue working on cost
containment.
"Clearly, we need someone
who is really in tune with the
challenges of not just any uni-
versity, but of a university in the
niche we occupy, which is a flag-
ship public research university,"
Pollack said. "I think we have
a good team in place to keep on
pushing, and I'm very optimistic
that the new president will have
support for where she needs to
handle these challenges."
In developing the Univer-
sity's budget, Pollack said she
and Coleman work together fre-
quently - spearheading a col-

laborative, process between the
individual schools and colleges'
offices, other executive officers
and the regents.
Coleman's tenure was dogged
first by a deep recession in Mich-
igan and later a national reces-
sion - contributing to 71-percent
increase in tuition since she
assumed the presidency in 2002.
Tuition rose only 1.1 percent for
this fiscal year, compared to an
increase of 2.8 percent for in-
state students and 3.5 percent for
out-of-state students lastcyear.
Affordability is a significant
challenge for many University
students, who are the heart of the
institution, said E. Royster Harper,
vice president ofstudent affairs.
Harper said one of Coleman's
most important contributions
to improving the quality of the
student experience on campus
was the Residence Life Initia-
tive - a more-than-$1-billion
commitment over the last
decade to renovate residence
halls and other facilities. Harp-
er said students should continue
to have a close partnership with
the president, just as they have
with Coleman.
"I think that's both the heart
of what Michigan is; I think it's
something that President Cole-
man had when she came and
certainly embodies," Harper
said. "I think any new presi-
dent will need to understand the
power of the voice of students at
Michigan ... I think it's part of
our strength."
Students also benefit from an
undergraduate teaching staff
ranked 12th by U.S. News and
World Report. According to Ter-
rence McDonald, director of the
Bentley Historical Library and
former LSA dean, Coleman has
been effective at helping individ-
ual schools and colleges retain
quality staff members. While
each school's dean works more
often with the provost, McDon-
ald said they benefit from know-
ing a "sensible" and "powerful"
leader guides and progresses the
University.
Coleman's commitment to
many facets of campus reflects
the strength of the University's
previous presidents, McDonald
said. Since McDonald joined
faculty during Harold Shapiro's
presidency, he said he's seen
a common thread of qualities
throughout the past and present
presidents: They're "focused,"
"determined" and "relentless in
their pursuit of goals."
By the expectations of those
conducting the search, those
qualities in a candidate are man-
datory.
From talking to donors, work-
ing with faculty, socializing with
students or creating a budget, the
next University president will
have a lot on his or her plate when
theybegin in 2014. There are some
big shoes to fill, but one thing's for
certain: The next president will
serve as the face of the University
foryearsto come.

The institute is offering a
new graduate certificate in
computational discovery and
engineering. Through MICDE,
Michielssen said, students can
enjoy the same intellectual vari-
ety as their professors, because
graduate students from all sci-
ence, technology, engineering
and math fields will take courses
together.
"My students take courses
with students who are much
like them: other electrical engi-
neers," he said. "But put these
same students in the room with
a physics or math or biology
student and automatically new
ideas just emerge."
. Thomas Finholt, Information
School professor and dean of
academic affairs, said high-pow-
ered computers were essential
to uncovering new insights in
the field of information. Search
engines use computer simula-
tion to modify and update their
product.
"You can't release the proto-
type search engine into the wild
and hope people use it," Finholt
said. "You need to simulate the
behavior ... and make modifica-
tions in the simulated world and
that will say what you want to
release."
Even the humanities and

social sciences can benefit from
computational research, he said.
High-powered computers can
scan the entire body of Shake-
spearean works for similar pas-
sages, giving historians a better
idea whether or not the plays
had different authors.
Such endeavors may be pos-
sible as MICDE expands to LSA.
Michielssen said the institute
aims to add 40 professors from
LSA and an additional 40 from
the College of Engineering and
the Information School. The
math, biology, chemistry, phys-
ics and earth sciences depart-
ments currently are highly
involved in computational
research.
Computational simulation
allows exploration of impossible
experiments. A meteorologist
can model what occurs inside a
tornado through this technolo-
gy, while such analysis is impos-
sible in real life.
High-powered computers
also lessen the cost of typi-
cally expensive experiments.
Aerospace Engineering Prof.
Iain Boyd said aer'odynamic
researchers would have had
to build models of rockets and
put them in a wind tunnel 30
years ago - a feat now made
possible by computer model-
ing.
"There's a small subset of
physical phenomena going on
you can look at in an experi-
ment," Boyd said. "You can cal-
culate everything and it will
be faster and it will be cheaper.
It's changing and it's changing
strongly toward more computa-
tions."


SUSTAINABILITY
From Page 1A
ing or reading just for your own
discipline, you might not have
the kind of linkages between
fields to look at impacts of (your)
projects."
A new volume of the journal
will be published annually with
topics relating to three themes:
sustainable freshwater systems,
livable communities and climate
change.
The journal's first annual
issue includes an article on
hydraulic fracturing, for exam-
ple, which involves the study
of freshwater systems, urban
planning, health sciences and
energy.
"There's a great push towards
interdisciplinary research
in journals, and sustainabil-
ity's needs are especially acute,"
Rajkovich said.
The Graham Fellows noticed
this unfilled need while they
were discussing possible
outlets in which they could
publish their research. They
discovered there weren't many
journals that appealed to the
diverse nature of topics in sus-
tainability. So, with the sup-

port of the Graham Institute,
the fellows decided to develop
their own.
"Ifanenvironmentalnonprof-
it organization or municipality is
grappling with a sustainability
challenge, we want them to turn
to the Michigan Journal of Sus-
tainability for valuable insights
and information," co-editor
Dana Kornberg said in a state-
ment.
This year's issue includes
articles that touch on topics as
diverse as sustainability and
social justice, Detroit, climate
change, green cities and human-
wildlife interactions.
Beyond the compatibility
of the journal's focus topics
with the study of sustainabil-
ity, Graham Institute Direc-
tor Don Scavia lauded the new
journal as a significant step in
furthering the institute's core
goals.
"The journal they created not
only fills a notable gap in aca-
demic publishing but also helps
to fulfill a primary mission ofthe
Graham Institute - translating
knowledge to influence deci-
sions that protect the environ-
ment and enhance quality of life
for present and future genera-
tions," he said.

"A better future is possible
where we aren't just creating
unnecessary waste," Meyer said.
"So we planto start with reusable
takeout containers and prove
that people are willing to reuse,
prove that people are willing to
put in a little extra effort."
The idea is pretty simple: cus-
tomers will be able to request
Bizeebox from participating res-
taurants and later return the reg-
istered box to the restaurant for
cleaning and recirculation.
GroussetandMeyer,whograd-
uated with dual degrees from the
School of Natural Resources and
the Environment and the School
of Business, initially piloted the
idea on campus in order to gauge
feedback and learn what needed
to be improved before applying
the idea to downtown Ann Arbor.
In graduate school, they cre-
ated the Go Blue Box, the prede-
cessor of Bizeebox. The container
was beta tested at the former Uni-
versity Club Restaurant in the
Michigan Union.
Although Go Blue Box and
Bizeebox are separate entities,
they both promote environmen-
tally friendly dining options. As
one of the first four grantees of
the Planet Blue Student Innova-
tion Fund, the team was given
$8,000 to launch the Go Blue Box
in the University Club last year.
"You get those moments
where people say, 'Oh, this makes
a lot of sense. Why aren't people
doing this everywhere?'" Grous-

set said. "There's a large segment
of people who go to restaurants
and care about the environment
and sustainability."
LSA senior Emily Jaffe, presi-
dent of Michigan Student Ath-
letes for Sustainability, said the
idea has great potential to grow
into something much bigger.
"When I was using the Go Blue
Box, it was so nice to be able to
walk out and return it the next
time I was around, and with
Bizeebox, there will be more
places to return them in Ann
Arbor, so I don't think it will be a
hassle," Jaffe said.
During the nine months that
the Union restaurant used the
Go Blue Box, Grousset and Meyer
estimated five thousand less dis-
posable boxes were used.
Upon leaving the University,
the team's focus on Go Blue Box
graduated into the development
of Bizeebox, which could be used
off campus. A few Ann Arbor res-
taurants have already expressed
interest. Next, the duo must raise
enough money to begin a manu-
facturing run, which the found-
ers hope to finance through an
Indiegogo campaign.
While Bizeebox is on its way to
being launched, a student orga-
nization, the Reusable Takeout
Container Program, has taken
initiative to continue the Go Blue
Box's legacy and promote dining
sustainability amongstudents.
Rackham student Rohit Nara-
yan, president of the organiza-
tion, said he and other group
members are pushing the Uni-
versity to bring back the Go Blue
Box to support waste reduction

in other venues on campus.
"A lot of classes in engineering
now support sustainability, so
there is a general push towards
making the campus more green
and now we just need the right
opportunities," Narayan said.
For now, Bizeebox will be for
only off-campus restaurants, but
Meyer and Grousset are looking
ahead to what their nascent com-

pany can work on next.
"In nature there is no such
thing as waste. Everything gets
reused, recycled and put back
into service some way," Meyer
said. "It's up to our generation to
make the future what we all want
to see."
Grousset said he and Meyer
have taken an optimistic
approach to rewind the dam-

age done on the environment
by the overuse of one-time con-
tainers.
"You look at all of the problems
in the world and can get pretty
depressed," Grousset said. "Our
sense of humor gave us playful
interaction, and we want to proj-
ect that in our business. We're
solving problems, but we're hav-
ing fun doing it."

Sufficient funds yet lack of safety
The Athletic Department should ensure that their programs are safe
At a forum on minors' on-campus safety on Sept. 24, the direc-
tor of the University's athletic camps admitted to "significant
gaps" in the University's ability to oversee the safety of. more
than 9,000 minors in attendance. For instance, Athletic Camp adminis-
trator Katie Miranto highlighted flaws in the University's background
checks, acknowledging that the system didn't account for crimes commit-
ted outside of Michigan - meaning out-of-state applicants, who make up
approximately 33 percent of all camp staff, might not be fully scrutinized
before beginning to work with children. While the Athletic Department's
acknowledgement of program flaws is a refreshing admission and steps
have already been taken to amend the process, it points to a serious lack of
prioritization within the Athletic Department.

The Athletic Department
has program in place to
protect children
TO THE DAILY:
The University of Michigan Athletic Depart-
ment wanted to correct the record regarding
incorrect information in The Michigan Daily.
The Athletics Department has spent the past
40-plus years providing a safe, fun environment
for tens of thousands of kids through the summer
camp program - an exceptional track record for
which we're extremely proud.
The Athletic Department, in partnership with
the University, University of Michigan Police
Department and others, protects minors at the
camps through background checks,training pro-
grams and numerous other ways. Many of the
counselors we select are teachers and coaches
elsewhere, and they are hand-picked by Univer-
sity of Michigan coaches who own and operate
the camps. Finances have never been a factor in
our decision-making about safe practices nor will

they ever be.
We recently identified a gap in the system,
were transparent about that at a public forum,
have made corrections and are moving forward
with anenhanced service thatincludes a national
directorysearch.
That said, background checks of all kinds
- whether handled personally, by coaches or
through database reviews - are important, but
they are just one way to keep kids safe. A multi-
layered effort is needed, and that's what we have
in place.
We've invested heavily in other areas to
enhance the safety of our programs, includ-
ing the hiring of a full-time administrator who
focuses daily on the summer camps, stepped up
safety and security training for the camp direc-
tor and counselors, establishment of a tracking
and location system for campers and coaches,
development of facility emergency plans that are
widely shared and annual audits of the camps to
assure compliance with our policies.

DAN GREEN I
Being black in Ann Arbor

AnnArbor - a college town with leafysubur-
ban campus, beautiful skies, an old tradition and
a dollop of grace - for all intents and purposes, is
a haven of safety. People come here from around
the world to study and to cheer on the ol' maize
and blue. Being from Detroit, I had (and still
have) the same aspirations as any student. But
being a senior at the University and being from
Detroit, I have encountered an unsettling reality,
one that may be surprising to those students who
routinely ask me, "How dangerous was your high
school?" and "When was the last time you were
shot at?"
I feel less safe in Ann Arbor than I do in
Detroit.
It's not that I feel more physically threatened.
There are some students who are.even so nice as
to walk on the opposite side of the street when
they see me walking their way. I feel a more per-
nicious, more dangerous threat than that. I con-
stantly feel that my identity as well as my city are
inneed of protection.
This year I'm finishing up my Organizational
Studies major. Out of 100 students, I'm the only
black man in the program. How can this be? We
are the flagship public university in the state of
Michigan. We are 40 minutes away from Detroit,
a city with a black population of at least 80 per-
cent. But what is our black enrollment here at
Michigan?Only about4 percent.Worse yet,black
enrollment has fallen 30percent since 2006.
Then we have the "I was a Quicken intern and
I love the Wings!" Detroiters. I'm sure you've
seen a lot of Detroit on the commute from West
Bloomfield, straight to Hockeytown and back
to your safe haven. Often times these are the

folks who went to Detroit Partnership Day that
one time freshman year and feel as if they have
actually accomplished something. I love DP Day,
but people should realize that it's a genesis of
something bigger. Your one day of service really
doesn'tamounttomuchifyouarenotgoingtotry
to create bigger change from that day of service.
And what do you have left?
You have a campus that claims to be diverse,
viewing the picture through a white lens, but
falling pretty short of that mark.
Some may argue, "Nothing is in Detroit; what
good can you really say about it?" I have seen
this in so many comment sections on blogs and
news sites. My family lives in Detroit. I person-
ally take offense to this remark because it pretty
much implies my family's existence is worthless.
It hurts me every time someone makes a blan-
ket statement about Detroit because I view it'
as a personal attack on who I am and what has
shaped me.
It's embarrassing that the University doesn't
have a bigger presence in the city of Detroit. It
could help a lot in debunking the myths and
challenge the. stereotypes many people have of
Detroit and Detroiters. The new Connector to
Detroit is cool, I guess, but I have a suspicion it
will be used most frequently for Red Wings game
trips, which breeds the pseudo-Detroiter men-
tality I mentioned earlier. I never even thought
of being a Detroiter as an identity until I came to
college. Now, it is an identity I hold with pride to
show the University that you really don't know
Detroit like you think you do.
Dan Green is an LSA senior.

ast week, a friend sent me
a study that concluded col-
lege is bad for women's
self-esteem.
According to
this 2012 study,
female students
graduated from
Boston College
with lower lev-
els of self-esteem
than they had ZOE
exhibited asS
freshmen. Mean- STAHL
while, the male
students of Bos-
ton College became more confident
during their college careers despite
having lower average GPAs than
their female counterparts.
As a private, Jesuit research uni-
versity on the East Coast, Boston Col-
lege may seem worlds apart from our
big, public, midwestern university.
But, it's not hard to imagine how the
same might go on here. In my classes,
I've noticed that my female peers
and I seem less certain of what we
say -undermining our musings with
"maybe," "sorta" and "kinda." The
scientific research seems to suggest
the same. According to the Center
for Collegiate Mental Health annual
report, female students were more
likely to experience depression, gen-
eralized anxiety, social anxiety and
eating concerns, making it hard to
imagine how female students could
feel confident about themselves.
Discussing the study with my
friends, we admitted that, sadly, we
weren't all too surprised. What con-
cerned us even more though was the
conversation following the report's
release. The social commentary was
predictable - merely platitudes.
Female students felt less confident,
a writer suggested, because of the
pressure to be perfect.

"Rush" is an inspiring film:

musical development in the sec-

lutely nothing HAIM has ever
attempted. Built off a slow burn-
ing drum-and-guitar combo,
the song shakes to life with an
unexpected eruption of light
dubstep mimicking fat synthe-
sizers. Danielle's vocals are sped
up and slowed down throughout,
the latter effect making "Honey,
I'm not your honey pie" sound
surprisingly frightening. "My
Song 5," which might as well
be Gwen Stefani's classic "Hol-

through a blender and filtered
through thick smoke, is about as
risk-taking as possible for HAIM,
And it pays off.
For the three sisters from Los
Angeles, who months ago prob-
ably couldn't even fathom their
impending success, the days are
certainly not gone - they're just
getting started. And as the chants
of "keep running" fade out at the
end of the album's closing track,

for those looking for newer
games to play with friends and
lacking access to the wonders
of "Mario Party 9" or "Super
Smash Bros. Brawl" on Wii, the
Xbox Live Arcade is pleasantly
full of independently developed
surprises. While they may lack
the polish of AAA titles, well-
designed games with functional
and interesting mechanics like
"Build 'n Bump" and "Hidden
in Plain Sight" make excellent
investments for the curious
gamer.
"Build 'n Bump" consists of
exactly two stages: building
and bumping. Up to four play-
ers on the same console select
one of four characters and a
team color by which to be iden-
tified. One player then builds
the level on which the players
will fight to the death. With
experience, carefully created
maps can play out in novel and
exciting ways.
What's better
than 'Smash
Bros.'? Indie
'Smash Bros.'
During the bumping phase,
players on opposite teams
attempt to jump onto each oth-
er's heads. Doing so nets you
a point, falling to your death
causes you to lose a point and

getting a fixed amount of points
wins you the game. That's it.
Yet this incredibly simplistic
concept translates into hours
upon hours of fun. The virtu-
ally limitless map possibilities
mean that no game will ever be
the same.
That being said, the game
lacks the support to save any of
the levels created, so devoted
"Build 'n Bump"-ers will have
to rebuild their favorite levels
from memory. Definitely worth
the $1 price tag, the first of these
two overlooked multiplayer
games makes a great addition to
any living room's repertoire.
For those with a penchant
for the mysterious, "Hidden in
Plain Sight" offers a variety of
stealth- and deception-orient-
ed games. Five modes - Death
Race, Ninja Party, Knights vs.
Ninjas, Assassin and Catch a
Thief - all offer a different take
on the matter. In each mode,
players select a team and begin
playing. Typically, players are
unaware of which of the 30 or
so characters on screen they
control, and a large part of the
game is determining who is and

is not a real person.
In Death Race, each player
has one bullet to use on another
character while they all com-
pete with two dozen computer-
controlled opponents for the
finish line. Overzealous play-
ers will find themselves get-
ting taken out right before the
finish line, and more cautious
ones will never make it in the
first place; gameplay is a careful
balance of boldness and precau-
tion.
In the Assassin mode, players
either embody a sniper guard-
ing a dinner party or an assassin
intruding on said dinner party.
Assassins attempt to kill as
many guests before being spot-
ted, snipers try to kill as many
assassins before guests die. Just
like "Build 'n Bump," "Hid-
den in Plain Sight" 's simple
mechanics translate into hour
upon hour of strategic, tense
and exorbitantly fun gameplay.
While not necessarily up to
today's aesthetic standards,
both of these games are a blast
to play with friends. Just don't
let anyone get any ideas about
having a dinner party.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

At Onion Creek,
a tear-worthy
performance

Junior linebacker Brennen Beyer's status at the SAM could hinge on the return of redshirt junior linebacker Jake Ryan from an ACL tear.
Beyer's surge and Ryan's return
presents w1 1 Cul decision

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily SportsEditor
Before Brennen Beyer was the
strong-side linebacker for the
Michigan football team, he was
its weak-side end. Before he was
a weak-side end, he was a wide
receiver at Plymouth (Mich.) High
School.
Before that, during his junior
year there, he played tight end. As
a sophomore, he played offensive
tackle. Through it all, on the other
side of the ball, he played defen-
sive end.
Then and now, Beyer is a Swiss
Army Knife of a player. At Michi-
gan, he played for two years at end
before redshirt junior linebacker
Jake Ryan tore his anterior cruci-
ate ligament this spring. The team
needed Beyer at linebacker, so
Beyer played linebacker. Now, the
list of position groups he hasn't
played for is shorter than the one
he has.
"I'm not unused to switching
positions," Beyer said after prac-
tice Tuesday. He added with a
laugh: "Could never throw."
But aside from that, there are
few positions left for Beyer to
try. That may be a blessing for
Michigan in the upcoming weeks,

because along with being one of
the defense's most versatile play-
ers, Beyer has also been one of its
most productive.
Playing in a front seven that
has struggled to rush the passer,
Beyer has been a constant pres-
ence in the backfield. Though he
splits time with fifth-year senior
CamGordon, Beyer leads the team
in tackles for loss with four. He is
tied (with Gordon) for the team
lead in sacks with two. He is one
off the team lead in quarterback
hurries and is one of just two play-
ers on the roster with a forced
fumble.
When Michigan needed a stop
in the final seconds to escape an
Akron upset, defensive coordina-
tor Greg Mattison called Cable
Zero Train - an all-out blitz.
Someone needed to get to the
quarterback. Beyer broke through.
The next week, Mattison said
that Beyer executed the play per-
fectly.
"He just does what he's coached
to do every time," Mattison said.
This Monday, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke said that "Brennen
Beyer probably is as important
piece to our football team as any-
body because he can do so many
Ai ----n - --crc n-- - "

Yet Beyer's emergence at the
SAM position presents the Wol-
verines with a surprisingly dif-
ficult decision. Hoke has said for
months that he expects Ryan
to return some time in October.
Ryan, Michigan's most explosive
and reliable defender last season,
will likely resume his role as the
starter.
Hoke said that he plans to get
Ryan more involved in this week
of practice. He has done individu-
al work without contact for weeks,
but "he does some team stuff more
and more every day," Hoke said.
So where does that leave Beyer?
Even after switching positions
this season, Beyer has played
on the line at times. Two weeks
ago, Mattison said he hadn't yet
thought about switching him
back to the line. (Both coordina-
tors were not available to speak to
the media this week due to ateam
meeting.)
"I don't know," Mattison said.
"We haven't even looked at that
yet. No. Brennen Beyer has done
a great job at the SAM linebacker
position; and he would always do
it, just like Jake did, put his hand
in the dirt in pass rush situations.
We'll put the best pass rushers out

comes."
Beyer, for his part, said he'd go
wherever the coaching staff asks
him to go. His experience gives
the staff plenty of options. As
does his size. At 6-foot-3 and 250
pounds, Beyer fits the size profile
of a number of positions. I
But a move back to the line
might be the most likely option.
He could back up Ryan atthe SAM
while Ryan regains his condition-
ing. But that would leave out Gor-
don, a team captain and himself
a productive defender. He could
shift within the linebacking corps,
but he'd still see little action, even
if his skills prove compatible.
The line, too, is jammed with
a deep rotation of players, but the
pass rush has disappointed this
year. Beyer, more than anyone,
has been successful getting to the
quarterback. That could be entic-
ing for Mattison.
And it could mean yet another
position change for Beyer. At this
point, though, Beyer has no issues
switching.
"Honestly, I didn't even know it
was a position change," said red-
shirt sophomore cornerback Blake
Countess. "I'm joking, but he just
seems like a natural at the posi-

Michigan follows
second-place finish

By MATTHEW KIPNIS
For TheDaily
The Michigan woman's golf
team was hoping it could build
on its upward trend at the Chal-'
lenge at onion Creek on Monday
and Tuesday in Austin, Texas.
The Wolverines returned to
the two-day, 54-hole invita-
tional for the first time since
2011 - when they placed sec-
ond, improving on their 15th
and seventh-place finish the
previous two years. This time,
though, they reversed course,
and they finished ninth out of
11 teams.
The tournament did not
start as planned, and midway
through the first round, Michi-
gan found itself tied for last
place with Texas-San Antonio.
The Wolverines were able to
pick up their play and to finish
the round
with - a com-

some physical errors affect us
through the 36-hole day and
dug a pretty deep hole. When
you are playing 36 holes in one
day, you are going to hit some
bad shots, everyone does. The
best teams are the ones who
aren't letting it get them down
mentally. They are not overre-
acting to bad shots. As a team,
we did a little better the second
day of the tournament, but we
did not play to the best of our
abilities."
Michigan sent five players
to Texas this week, including
seniors Yugene Lee and Alyssa
Shimel, junior Lauren Grogan,
sophomore Catherine Peteres
and freshman Grace Choi.
Senior Chelsea Pezzola partici-
pated in the tournament as an
individual.
Although Lee, Shimel and
Pezzola had played the course
before, it was Grogan who led
the way for the Wolverines. The
junior tied for 19th, finishing
the tournament plus-14. After
the first two rounds, Grogan
stood at plus-12 but managed to
score a two-over par 72 in the
third round.

Tech, the leader.
After the second round, later
that day, Michigan had gained
no ground on Texas Tech,
and in fact, fell back two more
strokes from the leader. The
Wolverines managed to main-
tain their ninth-place position,
posting a 309 in the second
round.
"We dug ourselves way too
big a hole after that first day,"
said Michigan coach Jan Dowl-
ing. "It was a pretty poor outing
and wasn't our best perfor-
mance by any means."
On the second day, Michi-
gan played its best golf of the
tournament, posting a 299 and
breaking 300 for the first time
in the tournament. But it was
not enough, as they had fallen
too far behind the rest of the
leaderboard in the first two
rounds, finishing the tourna-
ment where they had ended the
first round - ninth place.
"I was pretty disappoint-
ed in our showing this past

over par for
the tournament. Lee started the
third round poorly with three
bogeys in the first four holes but
finished the round with 11 pars
in the 14 remaining holes.
"(Lee) had a great comeback
in the third round Tuesday
morning," Dowling said. "She
showed a lot of gut and learned
a lot from her first 36 holes. She
didn't let one bad shot affect
her in the third round. Often
when you start to get over par
you try to force things, however
(Lee) did a great job staying in
the present and focusing on the
shot in front of her."
The Wolverines will have
two weeks to prepare for their
next tournament at the Diane
Thomason Invitational in Iowa
City.
"We don't have to reinvent
the wheel, but we have to get
back to work and focus on stay-
ing in the present, not allow-
ing physical errors to affect
our play as much as it did this
week," Dowling said.

Lexi Erwin: How unique
became unstoppable

By RYAN KRASNOO
Daily Sports Writer
Lexi Erwin is quirky.
A senior and co-captain on the
Michigan volleyball team, she
spends most of her nights before
bed absorbed in thoughts about
what her life will be like in 10
years. Her imagination spirals into
fantasies about playing profes-
sionally in Europe or South Amer-
ica, or touring the United States as
an urban planner. Her biggest fear
is divorce, despite the fact that her
parents are still together and her
insistence that she's far removed
from marriage herself. She has her
heart set on traveling to Greece
because the main character in
"The Sisterhood of the Traveling
Pants" goes to Greece, and Erwin
hopes to go everywhere the movie
character went.
Erwin is a spaz. She says so her-
self. She's deathly afraid of public
speaking, and any attempt at sav-
ing face is belied by her flushed
cheeks. "It's not like the 'cute'
blush," she says. "It's like the 'I'm
a tomato.'"
Her favorite quote is "The peo-
ple who love to eat are always the
best people," by Julia Child, Amer-
ican chef and TV personality. In
fact, Erwin considers a hidden
talent of hers eating whatever her
parents put on her plate wjen she
was younger. She giggles, embar-
rassed. "I guess it's not really a tal-
ent," she says. "I'm not very cool."
Erwin is gritty. The summer
before her sophomore year of high
school, she was on a jet ski for the
first time. One of her friends sug-
gested they drive fast and Erwin
agreed. Shortly after picking up
speed, her legs flew out and she
fell off the back, hitting her head
on the corner of the jet ski and
breaking 11 bones in her face. She
received 150 stitches above her
eyebrow. Somehow, she wasn't
concussed, and, miraculously,
after colliding with the jet ski, she
impacted the water so hard that
the bones went back into place
and prevented her from requiring
plastic surgery.
Had Erwin's head been turned
a little more, doctors said, the jet
ski would have hit her spine and
she likely would not have sur-
vived. She tells this story candidly
and with a hint of excitement.
"I think it's a really cool thing,"
she says. When asked if she's
a badass, she doesn't hesitate.
"Yeah," she deadpans. "Just a lit-
tle."
Individually, Erwin's attributes
are as bizarre as they sound. They
are a hodgepodge of seemingly
random and unrelated traits, but
collectively, they shape the back-
ground of a bona fide star who's
been doing things her own way
since she first picked up a volley-
ball.
And her transformation from
an inconsistent, unproductive
sophomore back-row player to one
of the nation's most lethal offen-
sive weapons is one of the most

Senior outside hitter Lexi Erwin went from inconsistent back-row player to one of the nation's most lethal offensive weapons,

remarkable Michigan coach Mark
Rosen has ever seen. With one
final season in Ann Arbor, Erwin,
idiosyncrasies and all, aims to for-
ever etchher name into the annals
of Michiganvolleyball.
Spring, Texas is a town of
roughly 50,000 people located
30 minutes due north of down-
town Houston. The Erwins have
called Spring home for the past
16 years after Lexi's father, Blane,
uprooted his family from Boston.
Biane, who had been working gru-
eling hours for IBM, was raised
to be a family man and decided
to take a pay cut in order to spend
more time with his wife and three
daughters. A job opened in Texas,
and he jumped at the opportunity.
Lexi found volleyball at a young
age and quickly climbed the Texas
ranks. She made the second team
for her club when she was 12, and
as her dedication to the game
increased, she became a highly
touted high-school prospect.
Erwin - whose parents are both
6-foot-t- sprouted four inches
from 5-foot-9 to 6-foot-t between
her freshman and sophomore
years of high school.
When she was 15, Erwin
watched Stanford play for the first
time and had her heart set on play-
ing for the Cardinal. Her coach
told her she mightbe good enough
to play there and that she could
be recruited. A lightbulb went off,
and her desire to play at the colle-
giate level intensified.
Erwin ponders not having
played volleyball, where she might
have ended up without it.
"I'd probably be in a hick [col-
lege] town in Texas with my
entire high school," Erwin says,
laughing, attempting to cover her
mouth as her"tomato face" sets in.
"That sounds so bad. I needed vol-
leyball to get out of there.",

Michigan was not originally
on Erwin's college list because
she didn't want to attend a school
where it snowed. Then one day, she
received a personalized recruiting
letter from the Wolverines' staff
- a section of a puzzle that said,
"You're the missing piece" with
her name on it.
"I thought it was so cool, and no

expected. She enrolled in a "Reli-
gion, Politics and Power" class
her freshman year, and, coming
from a conservative and Christian
atmosphere back home in Texas,
she was shellshocked by the class
discussions.
"It was the first time I'd ever
heard of people really believing
in evolution or people believing in.

and often clashed with coaches
and other authority figures.
That spring, eager for a change,
Erwin approached Rosen and told
him she wanted to be one of the
best outside hitters in the country.
"We felt that Lexi had a really
high top end but was underdevel-
oped and overlooked," Rosen said.
"I don't think I've ever had a play-
er that has transformed herself as
much as she has."
The lights are bright at Cliff
Keen Arena, and Erwin is strug-
gling. No. 10 Michigan is hosting
Maryland in the Michigan Invi-
tational, and Erwin is out of sync.
The timing on her jumps is off,
her kill attempts ineffective. One
of her shots is blocked easily and
drops on Michigan's side for a Ter-
rapins point.
Erwin huddles with her team-
mates and is not upset. In fact,.
she's smiling,' almost laughing.
She shakes her head, brushing
off another missed opportunity.
Teammate and junior setter Lexi
Dannemiller gives Erwin a slight
nod, indicating she will be look-
ingto send the nextball in Erwin's
direction. Dannemiller does, and
Erwin fires an attempt cross-
court that knifes through two
Maryland players for a Michigan
point.
Erwin, a 2012 honorable men-
tion All-American and 2013 pre-
season All-Big Ten selection, is
immensely talented. Her poor
play that evening is uncharacter-
istic but fixable, something she
has been striving toward for near-
ly two years.
Erwin has been seei g Michi-
gan's sports psychologist, Greg
Harden, every other week since
her sophomore year. Harden sug-
gested Erwin write down all of the
characteristics of the person she
aspired tobe when she ultimately
left Michigan -'a great volleyball
player, but a better teammate,
friend, and person.
While her off-the-court goals
are in a constant state of improve-
ment, Harden has also helped
Erwin shake her frustration on
the court. Gone are the days of her
brash and rigid volleyball person-
ality. She plays with a rare loose-
ness and thrives in - and needs,
really - a relaxing, fun vibe.
Erwin and her teammates often
joke in the gym that playing vol-
leyball is akin to the childhood
game of keeping a balloon off the
floor.
"We're basically a bunch of
20-year-olds acting like we're 5
again," Erwin says.
When Erwin finally allowed
her play on the courtto mirror her
character off it, things clicked. She
drove that mentality to the tune of
a school-record 614 kills last sea-
son while pacing Michigan to its
first-ever Final Four appearance.

When the Wolverines entered
the KFC Yum! Center in Lou-
isville, Ky., last December, days
ahead of their Final Four match-
up with Texas, ESPN reporters
swarmed the players. There were
interviews and photo shoots -
publicity rarely granted to non-
revenue student athletes. The
venue, home to Louisville basket-
ball, seats 22,000 people, nearly 11
times the size of Cliff Keen Arena.
All of a sudden, Erwin was
thrust into the spotlight. One
thousand people showed up to
watch her practice. The attention
consumed her, and anxiety reared
its ugly head. Her same free
approach that had led Michigan
to that point, that had remained a
constant when seemingly nothing
else did that season, evaporated
into a stoic, robotic-like effort
which left Erwin uncomfortable
and out of rhythm.
The effects carried over from
practice to the beginning of the
Wolverines' match with the Long-
horns, as Texas took the first set
25-12. Erwin retreated to the
bench, with her familiar goofy
smile reappearing, seemingly
unfazed by the beating Texas had
just delivered in the biggest match
in Michigan volleyball history.
"We were laughing," Erwin
recalled. "We just got whooped,
so badly, Someone made the com-
ment that we made every single
mistake you can make in a vol-
leyball game so we might as well
grow a pair and just play."
Erwin thought of her conver-
sations with Harden and relaxed.
She settled in and nearly sparked
an upset over the eventual nation-
al champion Longhorns. Despite
falling to Texas 3-2 and ending
their magical run, the Wolver-
ines rebounded, led by Erwin's 26
kills on a school-record 87 attack
attempts. She responded, smile
and all, and in an oddly poetic way,
Erwin's performance reflected
her ascent from Rosen's doghouse
to All-Tournament accolades.
"She's one of my all-time suc-
cess stories in terms of someone
I'm really proud of," Rosen says.
Nine months have passed since
Michigan's appearance in the
Final Four, since the first time
Erwin has - by her own admis-
sion - really felt like a talented
volleyball player. She's learned to
handle pressure better than she
ever thought she could. The atten-
tion that comes with being great
no longer corners her. She used to
"black out" and not know what to
do. Now, she's the one teammates
turn to, and laugh with, in pivotal
moments.
After a recent practice, Erwin's
thoughts stray off again like they
do before bed. She rambles on,
seemingly to no one in particu-
lar, about the Kardashians and
one of their latest exploits. She
pauses,then chuckles, awkwardly.
In a way, her off-beat remark is a
sign she's enjoying herself. But in
a truer sense, it's simply Erwin
being Erwin, whoever she is.

JAMES COLLER/aily
Erwin grew up in Spring, Texas, and the move to Ann Arbor was an adjustment.

like that," Erwin said. "I had to
visit."
In January of her junior year
of high school, Erwin visited Ann
Arbor and fell in love. She initially
had her heart set on Long Beach
State, but Rosen had given Erwin
tickets to a Michigan hockey game
and she was sold. Erwin was not
No. 1 on Michigan's target list,
though, and it wasn't until anoth-
er recruit fell through that Erwin
was able to commit.
The transition from the south
to progressive Ann Arbor was
more drastic than Erwin had

ing their opinions," Erwin says.
"I remember calling my mom and
saying, 'They said this in class, I
can't believe it.'"
The leap from high school
to college athletics wasn't easy
either. Erwin started just two
matches during her freshman
season, and as a sophomore she
was in and out of the front row.
The coaches were concerned she
wasn't physically capable or con-
sistent enough to play at the net
in front of the Big Ten elite. She
struggled, additionally, through
a self-described rebellious phase

MRn CROSS COnNwRY
Runner Smoragiewicz can bike and swim too

By REBECCA DZOMBAK
For The Daily
For most people, making the
Michigan men's cross country
team would be enough to sate
their athletic desire. But for
sophomore runner and interna-
tionally ranked triathlete Tony
Smoragiewicz, running is only a
third of what's on his plate.
Smoragiewicz started com-
peting at an early age; he was
in the pool by the tender age of
8 and entering triathlons by 12.
His interest in swimming was
sparked by his father, who swam
in college for Maine.
Training through his teen-
age years landed Smoragiewicz
in Beijing in 2011, racing against
fellow up-and-coming triathletes
in the International Triathlon
Union Junior World Triathlon
Championships, where he took
the bronze. He followed that per-
formance, placing 34th in 2012,
and this September, by placing
42nd. The ITU Junior-level race

is a sprint-distance triathlon,
which comprises a 750-meter
swim, a 20-kilometer bike ride,
and a 5,000-meter run.
Smoragiewicz believes the
drop in his performance in tri-
athlons is due to a combination of
the increased demands of college
life - both running and academ-
ics - and the fact that the compe-
tition has gotten tougher.
"Last year was a hard transi-
tion, going into school - start-
ing at college, being away from
home, being in a new training
atmosphere," Smoragiewicz said.
"This year, I feel like my training
is going really well. I know I had
a really good fitness level and that
I was prepared for the race, it just
didn't go very well. So that was
frustrating, but it was good moti-
vation for cross country this fall."
Balancing running, cross-
training in two other sports and
academics is no easy task, but
Smoragiewicz thinks that he has
a better feel for how to handle
everything this year. It helps

that Michigan coach Alex Gibby
and the rest of his teammates are
supportive of his triathlon goals.
The other colleges recruiting
him wouldn't have allowed him
to compete in triathlons, which
was the main reason he chose
Michigan.
"Any time you're competing
at the highest level, in any dis-
cipline, that's to be respected,"
Gibby told MGoBlue.com on
Sept. 30. "He's had a hard go of it
because he really has his feet in
two different worlds. He's trying
to compete at a world-class level
in the triathlon in the summers
and develop as a national-class
distance runner through the
other nine months of the year. It's
a tough balancing act, but I think
it's one he's handled with consid-
erable maturity."
Smoragiewicz's training
focuses primarily on running
during the school year, which
makes sense, as he's an excellent
runner. His best race last year
was at the Big Ten meet, where

he placed 16th. He continues tc
swim and bike; his teammates
even venture into the water every
once in a while to work out witl
him.
Although triathlons have
grown to be highly competitive
and draw deep international
fields, the NCAA does not recog-
nize the triathlon as an official
sport. Instead, Smoragiewic2
occasionally trains with the Tri-
athlon Club on campus. He's OK
with this arrangement, since
running cross country and racing
triathlons - both at high levels of
competition - at the same time
would be exceedingly difficult.
Smoragiewicz's aspirations
don't end there.
"I'll probably do (an Ironman)
once I'm older," Smoragiewicz
said. "But for now I'm going tc
focus on transitioning to 'the
Olympic distance, since I'm mov-
ing out of the junior level. Later
though, an Ironman would be
fun. Grueling, but fun ... mainly
grueling."

Can University students
work hard and play hard?
with Business senior Christine Vanek and
LSA senior Cameron Fletcher

We've all heard the Wiz Kahlifa
song, "Work Hard Play Hard." Wiz's
recommendation to achieve both:
"Make sure you do whatever is that
you gotta do, that's your job" (as well
as make it rain with bigger bills). But
in all seriousness, with a surplus of
academic requirements and orga-
nizations on campus, can students
maintain a balance between work-
S,,jiard and playing hard? Business
senior Christine Vanek and LSA
senior Cameron Fletcher met in The
Michigan Daily newsroom to answer
this question based on their own
experiences.
Cameron Fletcher: I think the
answer is definitely yes, mostly
because the University attracts
really motivated people. The Uni-
versity has so many opportunities
for people to do stuff. People are
"Otivated to do what they love,
and that could be academics or
that could be outside of academ-
ics. I feel like people will have
their work and then they have
their passion, and they're moti-
vated to finish their work so they
can do their passion. Or if their
passion is work, they can just do
work.
Christine Vanek: I think it's
cool that people come in with
a lot of different interests and
then, eventually, as you're moving
through your years at U of M, I've
found work and play really start to
overlap in more interesting ways.
CF: For sure. I'm in a percussion
group on campus called Groove,
and I'm in two music classes right
now. I've just seen both of those
overlap perfectly. What I use in
Groove is what I'm learning in
class, and I also use what I learn in
class in Groove. It's pretty cool that
:y overlap.
CV: I've found that, too. I've
started doing a lot of research, and
right now I'm doing (research) with
1,000 Pitches, and it's just really
cool to see how my own personal
interest in innovation can also be
something that counts as work.

that are fish-related are really fun
for me, and they're definitely inter-
esting. But it's taken me a while to
get to those classes. The classes I've
taken for the past three years, not
all of them have been the classes
that I want to be inbutIjusthave to
be in themto get to the ones I would
enjoy. Now, since I'm in those class-
es, they're a lot easier just because
I enjoy them more. And because
they're easier, it's not as hard to sit
down and take the time to do that
work when I know I have other fun
things I could be doing.
CF: You're doing business. Are
those classes hard? I know a lot of
people think Business classes are
hard.
CV: Some of the classes are hard,
some of the classes are easier. A
lot of them, for me, have quantita-
tive stuff and you just have to get
through the exercises. But then
there are others where it's talk-
ing about the strategy of Microsoft
search and what they should do
going forward to be more success-
ful and, perhaps, try and take on
Google. Havingthe chance to think
about a real business challenge and
break it apart and invent a possible
strategy for a company - when I
get to sit down and do that with my
peers, that's working hard but it's
also kind of playing. It's a lot of fun.
CF: That's cool. I don't get to do
a lot of fish stuff with other people,
since I feel like it's not a group
activity.
CV: You could take a trip and go
fishing with some people!
CF: I would definitely love to
do that, and it would be work-
ing and playing at the same time.
That's kind of what I'm looking
for in post-grad: research and field
stuff. I just love being outdoors,
and working with fish hands-on is
one of my favorite things to do. If I
could get that as a post-grad job or
fellowship, then that would be the
ultimate playing and working at the
same time.

CF: Right. What are you pitch-
ing?
CV: I'm not pitching, I'm just
studying (the pitches). It's kind of a
bit top-secret.
CF: I know whenever I sit down
to do work, I always have a goal in
my mind, like I have a show next
week so I should probably get my
paper done this week so I'm not all
crazy. I think, for me, it just comes
down to motivation. I think every-
one at this school has something
they're motivated to do, and that's
what makes it easy to work hard.
CV: For me, motivation is some-
thing that kind of makes it difficult
to work hard and play hard, because
there's just 24 hours in a day, right?
CF: Yeah, that's true.

make time forthings that are impor-
tant. There are some days where I
have to rush to finish something so
I can run to a Comedy Club meeting.
CF: Yeah, that's another thing:
deciding what to put your effort
into. I've seen that over the course
(of my college career), I've kind of
taken some effort from my academ-
ics and put that into other things,
such as Groove or Camp Kesem,
which is another organization I'm
in. ButI just think that's interesting
that over the course of college, you
figure out what you like to do and
you realize that some of the classes
that you have to take aren't that
important in the long run.
CV: Do you find that the time
and the energy you put into your
clubs energizes you more for the
rest of your week and the rest of the
stuff you have to get done?

I do. I love going to those meet-
ings and seeing the people that I
always see, and that just makes me
feel better, honestly, for the rest
of the week. I think that helps me
get through the tough parts of the
week. As a senior, I've definitely
put more time into my clubs and my
extracurriculars than my classes. I
don't know if that's the right thing
to do, but that's what I've found
makes me happier, which I think is
more important than doing well on
a stupid exam.
CV: So you're studying environ-
mental science, right?
CF: Yeah.
CV: Do you find that that's
become something that's not just
a work interest but something that
stems into your personal life?
CF: Yeah. My concentration is
fish and aquatics, and I've always
loved fishing and fish. Those classes

sse 921 ann arbor affairs: distance and decisions by jencalfas

Dave Brandon's fireworks: How 'The Dave Brandon Show'
changed the Athletic Department
"Dave Brandon is very much the 21st century Don Canham
- who was running the show when Mr. Brandon was an ath-
lete. I was there during DC's era too and find many similarities
between them. The scale and methods of college sports have
changed, but the dramatic flair is very much the same."
- USER: '82Grad

"So what exactly is the point? He has done many good things,
yes. Have there been hiccups, sure. But by your own story the
good has far outweighed any negative. Stop trying to make a
controversy when there isnt one."
- USER: Bradley Paskievitch

He had my yearbook for a solid
hour. As I watched him scribble
endlessly with black Sharpie
across the back page, I struggled
to find words to put down in his.
It wasn't that I couldn't think of
anything to say, but the probability
of writing down what I considered
to be the elephant in the room -
a.k.a. the lounge our grad night
took place in - outweighed any-
thing else.
After eventually giving up and
writinga short, sweet note and
moving on to signing other year-
books, Zach stood up, handed my
book to my friend who had been
waiting, and walked over to me.
"Don't read what I wrote in
your book. I want to talk to you
about it on the bus first."
Uh, alright. Throughout the fol-
lowing hours ofsigning yearbooks,
eating sandwiches and getting
temporary tattoos, Zach's words
loomed above my head. Grad night
was fun, but I really just wanted
to hear what he had to say once it
was over.
Five o'clock hit: time to head
back. Zach and I walked hand
in hand to the bus and took the
back seat behind all of our friends
who deliriously snacked on candy
and eventually passed out from
exhaustion.
"I know it's kind of early, but I
wanted to figure this out as soon as
possible... "

Yep, here it is. The elephant was
about to be addressed.
"I don't know what you're
thinking about this, but I want to
stay together through college. I
love you, and breaking up with you
would absolutely break my heart"
Relief.
While we only dated for a few
months before making decision to
stay together, it felt right. I often
consider Zach my best friend
rather than my boyfriend, and I
believe that's the best mindset to
have in a relationship. (Note: The
only two other relationships I've
had were in fifth grade and with
my good friend, Huntington, who
is gay. So maybe my insight is a
little lacking.)
The summer of 2012 went by
quickly. August came around and
we both began perusing different
paths in college: he at Washington
University in St. Louis, me at the
University of Michigan.
Although I missed him con-
stantly, I found our long-distance
relationship to really come in
handy when it came to attending
the almost-obligatory frat parties
during freshman Welcome Week.
(We're in college now, guys!)
With every frat boys' terrifyingly
disgusting pursuit, I easily and
nonchalantly responded: "I have
a boyfriend.' While the responses
were usually mixed, it did serve as
a great method to ward off testos-
terone-filled creepers.
Ao

As we both became more
immersed in our lives at our
respective schools, the time
between visits became shorter and
our ability to navigate social scenes
and activities became easier. Yes,
we still text constantly and Skype
every so often, but the indepen-
dence offered to each of us allows
us to pursue what we're passionate
about.
Some of my friends who are in a
relationship are perpetually glued
to their significant others, making
it impossible for them to interact
with anyone else. Sure, I often
imagine how great it would be if
Zach were here. But I realize how
much I've been able to progress
by navigating Michigan without
my family, anyone else from my
high school, and, yes, without my
boyfriend.
As Daily columnist Emily Pit-
tinos wrote recently, long-distance
relationships might not be worth
it. If you're the kind of person who
can't navigate life without being
led by the hand of your boyfriend
or girlfriend, I'd refrain from
engaging in a life like mine.
The distance remains between
us, but the end goal looms in
both of our minds. With the reas-
surance of what's to come after
school, I can truly explore Ann
Arbor, which I consider a world of
my own.

ILLUSTRATION BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND

Feast Your Eyes: An ode to Ari and Paul
"Ari is my mentor and I look up to him practically more than
anyone in the industry. An excellent article indeed and well
written."
- USER: Josh Kimbell

About one hundred years ago, my
great-grandfather landed in Amer-
ica from Lebanon - then part of
greater Syria. Fifty years before that - in
1860 - Lebanon had been torn apart by sec-
tarian conflict between Maronite Catholics
and Druze.
He was neither. For generations, his fam-
ily had been Greek Orthodox Christian,
stuck in the middle between a wealthy and
influential Maronite majority and a Druze
and Muslim minority backed by the Otto-
man government.
It's hard to know exactly what his village
was like when he left. Today, Khiam Mar-
jayoun - the same village journalist Antho-
ny Shadid's parents came from - is one of
the few Orthodox Christian outposts left in
Southern Lebanon, a stony town on a rolling
green Lebanese hill.
His father was blind and his mother was
handicapped - though his father made a
meager living by being the village herbal-
ist. (I once referred to the job as a "witch-
doctor," which earned the justified wrath of
my grandmother.) As the Ottoman Empire
waned, my great-grandfather left Lebanon,
alone, at about 16-years-old - hoping to
avoid the Ottoman draft and find work in
America.
The country that adopted him sent him to
war in 1917 - where he fought in the fields of
France for a nation that was barely his, for a
people he hardly knew. His first view of Old
Europe was probably in a dirty trench with
wet socks, where he inhaled mustard gas
and resolved to only donate to the Salvation
Army - since they gave soldiers free coffee

while the Red Cross charged for it.
When he returned from the war, he found
the successful chain of grocery stores he
had built in Flint, Michigan had disap-
peared - as had the money - with a rela-
tive who had been charged with keeping the
business while he was away. So, like millions
of men from his generation, he became an
autoworker. For decades, he worked in the
manufacturing complex that would become
the famed "Buick City," perhaps now more
remembered for being progressively demol-
ished from 2002 to 2006 than for the mil-
lions of cars that rolled off its assembly lines
over the half century it existed.
Though the manufacturing job went well,
the mustard gas from the fields of France
continued to haunt him every winter -
when he would contract pneumonia - but
he had to go to work or not get paid. In the
summers, he saw men in the steel casting
plant, collapsing from heat stroke, being
physically dragged away by managers and
replaced with new workers to keep the line
rolling.
He again found himself at the edge of his-
tory when he participated in the formative
1937 Sit-Down Strike, protesting those hor-
rendous conditions. My grandmother said,
"He wasn't anything special. He was just
one of the workers." But I still think that's
something. The strike led to the recognition
of the United Automobile Workers by Gen-
eral Motors and later Chrysler and Ford.
After that, his life seemed mostly
uneventful. He raised my grandmother and
her siblings, helped build a church for Arab
Orthodox Christians in Flint and died while

drawing a GM pension.
I never knew him. Sorry for the letdown.
He died in the 1970s, well before I was born.
But his life does serve as an inspiration for
my own - and perhaps the legend is greater
than the man himself.
I'm the child of two teachers, both born
and raised in Midwestern America. Three
generations hence, my family is still Greek
Orthodox, though I don't identify with
being an Arab-American like any of the gen-
erations that preceded me. I'm more than
happy with the food, but I don't feel the
need to debate or dwell on absolutist politi-
cal positions in Middle East policy or smoke
a water-pipe - sorry, now called a "hookah."
As I'm trying to find my way in this world,
I find myself drawn to my own family's his-
tory for inspiration. I don't need to leave my
country with nothing to my name to start
over in a foreign land - thank God for that.
But I do think America offered something
different to my grandfather than it does for
me.
While studying abroad in Russia last year,
my professor said he was one of those people
who thrived on discomfort - the kind you
get from being a stranger in a foreign land. I
would like to think I'm one of those people
too. My great-grandfather must have been.
Instead of traveling abroad and returning
home, he made a new home, where every
day was a challenge to build a life and family
while trying to respect his cultural inheri-
tance but assimilate to his new country.
Something my great-grandfather did out
of necessity, I hope to do by choice. He left
his country to find new opportunities in

another country; I hope to leave mine to rep-
resent it abroad. My goal is to be a Foreign
Service Officer - a diplomat representing
the United States. For my great-grandfather,
life in the United States meant economic
security, freedom and safety from the .-
tarian clashes of the old world. For me, the
modern American life makes it difficult to
build something enduring while racing from
job-to-job and city-to-city searching for that
elusive promise of economic security.
The two pictures that I've seen of my
great-grandfather are of an austere, well-
mustachioed young man about my age and
another from the late 1950s, as a wrinkly,
smiling and proudly toothless old man
bouncing my father on his lap. At the very
least, it's comforting to know that the life
of an immigrant-soldier-autoworker can
lead to happiness - which, when I'm feeling
cynical, I think is restricted to those getting
the $75,000 "starting street" salary in their
first year out of the Business School.
I've never been to Lebanon. The coun-
try of my ancestors (for full disclosure, half
of them) is still wracked by violence and
plagued by a weak government. A century
after my great-grandfather left Lebanon,
the Maronites and Muslims have flipped
demographics, but it's still a very divided
country with an unfortunate penchant for
never-ending retaliatory rocket attacks.
Eventually, maybe, I'll get there. For Niv-w,
it seems about as distant as America must
have seemed to my great-grandfather.

Cadavers Get Personal
by Jackson Howard

statement on the street: Thoughts on the government shutdown?
~ VI___ ' on the record

ust as they do today, University
medical students in the mid-19th
century studied human cadavers
in the early stages of their medical train-
ing. Unlike today, though, the cadavers
those students studied were not donated
legally. Rather, they were acquired in a
decidedly illegal, morally questionable,
no-questions-asked manner reminiscent
of a horror movie.
In the 1860s, before amendments to the
Michigan Anatomy Act of 1875 allowed
easier access to cadavers for educational
rposes, the University procured cadav-
ers in every imaginable way, such as buy-
ing them with cash from random brokers
- with no knowledge of where they came
from - or even stealing them from anon-
ymous graves, according to Horace W.
Davenport's history of Michigan's medi-
cal school. According to Davenport, three
professional body snatchers were arrested
in Toledo, Ohio in 1878 after authorities
found they had a contract to ship about 130
bodies to - you guessed it - Ann Arbor,
Michigan.
a.day, the University's Anatomical
Donation Program - note the use of the
word "donation" - is legitimate, and is
certainly no longer robbing graves. Aided
by the state's Revised Uniform Anatomical
Gift Law and similar legislation in the past
60 years, the University's program accepts
over 300:gifts per year and has more than
7,000 future donors already registered.
In 1909, the original Michigan Anatomy
Act was revised, effectively providing the
University with nearly 100 legally obtained
bodies per year. Almost 100 years later,
RUAGL, (which stemmed from changes
to Michigan state legislature in 1958, 1969
and 1978), was enacted in 2009. RUAGL's
adoption in Michigan created near unifor-
mity across states in anatomical donation
law, in addition to simplifying the dona-
tion process and protecting donor intent.
Anatomical donations are essential for
medical students' education, as they are
oftentimes referred to as students' "first
patient." Anatomy courses rely on such
donations to provide their students with
first-hand knowledge of the basic struc-
ture of the human body, knowledge that
sees as the foundation for years of medi-
cal training ahead.
The donation process
The process of donating one's self to
we dicine is not as easy as dropping off a
body at the Medical School steps. There
are legal and procedural requirements

taken by both the donor and the University
to ensure the safety and legitimacy of the
body being donated.
The University keeps a strict proto-
col when dealing with anatomical gifts.
Once the donation has been permitted by
RUAGL - requirements including notifi-
cation to the donor's family, registration
with the University and proper delivery of
the body by a funeral home, among other
things - the donation is then inspected. In
order to be used in the classroom, the body
has to be in the proper state, meaning no
emaciation or obesity, no extensive burns
or mutilation and no history of contagious
diseases.
In addition to physically clearing the

between the rigid process of studying
a cadaver in a medical context and the
innate emotion associated with the death
of a fellow human. How, then, do you
reconcile both the scientific and moral
aspects of a notion such as anatomical
donation - a concept that is truly without
societal parallel?
One way the program is trying to bridge
this gap between the scientific and the
personal is a new initiative beginning
this year that allows donors to voluntarily
prerecord videotaped messages to accom-
pany their body. These video messages,
in which the donor is able to talk about
whatever he or she chooses, are played for
the students - again, voluntarily - before

"The University procured
cadavers in every imaginable
way, such as buying them with
cash from random brokers -
with no knowledge of where they
came from - or even stealing
them from anonymous graves.."

said Dean Mueller, the University's Ana-
tomical Donor Program coordinator. "Are
they doing it for personal reasons? Are
they doing it because they like our football
team? You never know. It can be so many
different dimensions, and it was interest-
ing to think, 'Why would you donate?'"
No matter the reasons behind the
donation, Mueller, the students and the
program's overall sentiment towards
its donors is one of humility and great
thankfulness.
"You immediately feel an obligation to
accept the donation and use their body
for the best possible way that we can use
them, and to learn everything that we can
learn from them," Mueller said.
These feelings, along with others of
gratitude, admiration and honor, were
expressed repeatedly throughout the
Medical School's annual Donor Memo-
rial Service, held Sept. 18 in Rackham
Auditorium.
The service itself is certainly unlike any
other type of memorial. The entire pro-
gram - from musical performers to ushers
- is staffed completely by current medical
and dental students, all dressed in white
lab coats, as a demonstration of respect
and thankfulness to the donor's families
in attendance. Several students gave short
personal remarks detailing their own per-
sonal experience with the donors and the
incredible learning experience that they
gained from the opportunity.
These students also expressed thanks
for the donor's gift. Students touched on
their inability to repay a donor's selfless-
ness and echoed Mueller's statement of
honoring their donor's legacy in the only
way they can: by becoming the best physi-
cians, dentists, nurses, physical therapists
and health professionals possible.
On the front of the program for the
memorial service, there is an inscription of
a Latin phrase that is also seen on a plaque
in the Anatomical Donations Program:
Hic Locus Est Ubi Mors Gaudet Succur-
rere Vitae. "This is the place where death
rejoices in coming to the aid of life."
It is this balance, of the dead helping the
living then the living paying respect back
to the dead, that makes anatomical dona-
tion one of the more fascinating and com-
plex processes in society.
"It's not even really about the students,"
Mueller said. "It's about humanity and
those student's impact. You can say that
(the donors) are giving (their bodies) to
the students - which, in a sense, they are
- but they're really just passing on some-
thing positive to the world."

"I think it's a symptom "It's silly that the Democrats "I don't want to give an

body, the University enforces privacy and
respect for the dead to the upmost extent,
as the bodies are never on display in the
open and are used solely for medical pur-
poses.
Getting to know the bodies
Though the program can be summed
up neatly in terms of its strict legality,
respectful procedure and clear necessity,
the human aspect of the process cannot be
ignored. These cadavers were, at one point,
the bodies of living, breathing people who
led real lives and, for whatever reason,
chose to donate their bodies to science.
Understandably, things become a little
murky when attempting to draw a line

they begin their dissection. Though it may
sound uncomfortable to watch the person
you are about to cut open talk about their
life via a video message, two studies from
2011 show that medical students actually
desire a more personal relationship with
their donors.
Published in the journal "Anatomi-
cal Sciences Education," the studies led
by University alum Michael Bohl, found
74 percent of students and 81 percent of
donors surveyed said they would partici-
pate in the video-message program, while
the vast majority of students answered
that they wanted a deeper personal con-
nection with their donor.

ithin the University
lies a giant - quiet
and unnoticed by
many students as
they run between
classes, dorms and
dining halls.
The University of Michigan Health System
consists of 29 departments, about 3,000 fac-
ulty and staff members and about 1,800 medi-
cal, graduate and postdoctoral students. Some
departments, such as Internal Medicine - with
over 700 faculty - are larger than every other
school and college at the University. Accounting
for nearly half of the University's operating bud-
get, it's approximately 200 times larger than the
entire Athletic Department financially.
But amid the changing national healthcare
climate, UMHS must now take new and innova-
tive approaches to maintain the financial secu-
rity of a $2.6-billion enterprise.
MAKING CENTS OF CHANGE
"In a way, the present and the future are sort
of using the same words."
Doug Strong, chief executive of the University
of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers, faces
the challenge of turningvisions of the future into
reality while managing all patient-care opera-
tions conductedby the University.
"In terms of patient care, our assignment
goal and our daily work is to improve quality
and efficiency at the same time," Strong said.
"We're under significant, but appropriate
financial pressure - external pressure - to
really do both things."
In addition to these external pressures, UMHS
was financially strained in recent years through
the construction of the C.S. Mott Children's Hos-
pital and Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital,

which opened in December of2011at aproject cost
of $754 million.In the 2012 fiscalyear, UMHS saw
a 0.5 percent loss on its operating expenses after
drawing in $2.1 billion in revenues, according to
the University's financialreport.
However, the construction of the new facili-
ties is a necessary partof growing the health sys-
tem to accommodate the typical 4-to-5-percent
growth in patient volume per year.
"We built that building to last 40 or 50 years
so we expect to take it on at a loss and build it
up over time," Strong said. "We're very much on
track for that, it's filling up on schedule."
"We're investing ourselves for the future -
short-term pain, long-term game."
In addition to construction, he said the
hospital's health record system update -
contracted to the Wisconsin-based Epic
Systems Corporation - contributed to the
financial concerns.
The new system was implemented over sev-
eral months, and intended for use by the Uni-
versity's approximately 1.9-million clinic visits
per year.
"It caused us to slow down because it was
complicated and people had to learn it," Strong
said. "As a result we were suffering more finan-
cially than we hadhbeen previously ... as we speak
we are resurfacing from that."
Despite its not-for-profit status, UMHS must
still generate revenue to fund such expansions.
While the hospital can raise prices on some ser-
vices to compensate for losses, many prices are
dictated by Medicare or other nationalinsurance
programs and, therefore, cannot be negotiated
by the University.
In order to reduce costs, UMHS is working to
reduce waste, error, and duplication - estimated
to account for as much as 30 percent of health-
care costs nationwide, Strong said.
"If you cut that in half... it means we probably

need less physical structures," he said. "We'll
probably be investing less in big newhospitals...
and more in ambulatory facilities because it may
be less necessary."
Technological innovations are also expected
to decrease costs by allowing inpatient cases to
be treated on an outpatient basis, he added.
While maintaining the day-to-day operations
of the University's hospitals and health centers,
Strong must also keep a watchfuleye on the state
of healthcare reform on a national level. Beyond
the scope of the Affordable Care Act - or Obam-
acare - Strong said the nature of healthcare in
the country is changing at a fundamental level.
"The national issue is that healthcare costs
have been increasing much faster than the rate
of inflation for a long period of time - that's the
cost curve that people want tobend,"Strongsaid.
Americans have made choices as a culture
that mean higher healthcare spending, he said.
"But the chorus around us is saying that it's too
much, and that is felt in the state of Michigan."
Despite the implementation of the ACA, the
future of healthcare reform appears uncertain.
House Republicans have voted to defund the
legislations upwards of 40 times, and it was the
main point of contention between the two par-
ties that resulted in the government shutdown.
Regardless of the implementation of Obam-
acare, Strong said change is necessary on a
national level.
"The national incentive is to use too much.
And I think experts say there's huge variations
actually in care patterns," he said. "Employers
need healthcare quality and efficiency to be
improved as much as Medicare and the gov-
ernment does."
One emerging trend among U.S. healthcare
providers is the concept ofpopulation manage-
ment, which gives ahealth system or group the
responsibility to care entirely for the health of

a large population, regardless of the services
provided. Under the new healthcare laws,
these have come to be known as accountable
care organizations.
This may represent the future of health-
care at the University as the hospital expands
its geographic reach within Michigan. Cur-
rently, UMHS operates 40 outpatient facili-
ties and 120 clinics and, in the future, these
sites may play a larger role in maintaining
public health.
"I think you'll see organizations like ours
extend, maybe through partnerships, deeper
into communities to promote health," Strong
said. "Fortunately, in our marketplace, there's a
greatdemand for our services."
Regardless of the financial and organizational
hurdles, Strong remains confident the Univer-
sity will continue to provide some of the nation's
most advanced healthcare.
"We do our jobs very well and we're able to
take care of patients that have very complex con-
ditions that can't be taken care of elsewhere,"
Strong said. "We have the best and the brightest
in terms of physicians ... and others who are on
our staff. It just really attracts patients by virtue
of the fact that we do things well."
THE BIRTH OF A HOSPITAL
When the first class of medical students
arrived at the University in 1850, they could
expect to pay $5 per year for two years of edu-
cation that consisted of lectures. Students were
not required to obtained an undergraduate
degree - they only needed a basic understand-
ing of Latin and Greek.
Over the next century and a half,'the Univer-
sity developed one of the first formal medical-
trainingprograms,introduced clinicalclerkships
into the educationalprocess and opened the first

university-owned hospital in the nation.
Former University President James Duder-
Astadt said the medical school and health system
were one of the most important developments in
thehistoryofthe University.
"It's very important - it's also very large,"
Duderstadt said.
After World War II, increased federal fund-
ing and the formation of the National Institute of
Health prompted major expansion of the Univer-
sity's research efforts, as well as medical educa-
tion. Today, approximately 65 percent of federal
funding coming into the University is marked for
biomedical research, Duderstadt said.
"Medical education has always been a very
important part of the University," he said.
"Although started as an educational activ-
ity it rapidly evolved into the premier source of
healthcare in the state of Michigan and one of
the best in the United States."
As it became established as a nationally
renowned health center in the mid-20th century,
UMHS began to generate its own resources and
operate, to a larger extent, under its own lead-
ership. Duderstadt compared this independent
operation to University Housing or the football
team, both of which generate enough revenue to
cover their own expenses.
"As it became more prominent in treat-
ing advanced diseases - diseases that you
couldn't treat anywhere else - it became
larger and larger," Duderstadt said. "Struc-
turally it was reconfigured to become an aux-
iliary activity."
With the onset of health-maintenance orga-
nizations, such as Humana, in the 1980s and
1990s, many large research universities across
the nation began to "spin off" their hospitals
to cut costs and protect the finances of their
respective colleges. Currently, there are sev-
eral models of university-hospital relation-

ships nationwide, suchas Harvard University,
which operates independently of Massachu-
setts General Hospital.
Over the last 15 to 20 years, some have sug-
gested a similar spin-off of UMHS from the
University. While this idea was put before the
University's Board of Regents, Duderstadt said
it was not in the best interest of the University.
"We explored that very carefully but in the
end the regents of the University decided that
there were many good reasons to retain own-
ership of the hospitals and continue to manage
them," Duderstadt said.
James Woolliscroft, dean of the Medical
School, said he agreed with the decision to
keep the health system under the ownership of
the University.
"For our medical students, learning in a
context where the highest quality clinical
care is provided is arguably the most power-
ful learning modality we have," Woolliscroft
said. "Lectures and books pale in comparison
to being immersed in a place where you live,
breath, see this incredibly high-quality care
being rendered."
Woolliscroft's alma mater, the University of
Minnesota, merged its hospital with Fairview
Riverside Medical Center in 1997 when the rise
of managed care threatened to increase the cost
of healthcare across the nation.While University
of Minnesota still maintains a top 10 ranking in
primary care, its research rank has dropped to
38th in the U.S. News and World Report medical
school rankings.
"They disassembled the whole enterprise,"
Woolliscroft said. "I think that was just a terrible
decision and they'll never recover from it."
Giving medical students direct access to a
high-quality medical center greatly benefits
their education, but Woolliscroft said the future
of medical education may see more students in

community clinics, rather than large hospitals.
"That's really critical that students have the
ability to interact with patients, to learn from
patients and that remains is true today as ever,"
Woolliscroft said. "The-context, the physical
site has changed as more and more care moves
ambulatory, more and more education moves to
ambulatory clinics."
"Medicine, for now, has more promise than
ever in my career so the challenge is figuring
out how to capitalize on this for the good of
society and the good of our individual patients,"
he said. "But the place won't look like it does
now in 20 years."
THE PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITY
Even amid the uncertain future of healthcare
in the United States, Duderstadt is busy looking
at the role UMHS will play on a national and
global level in the coming decades.
"We're very much a public university," Duder-
stadt said. "We were founded that way. It's still
part of our character and will remain there. The
question is, who is that public?"
In the coming years, UMHS will likely play
an increasing role in national and international
healthcare and medical research. The University
- originally founded under an act of Congress 20
years before there officially was a state of Michi-
gan - has "national as well as state responsibili-
ties," Duderstadt said.
However, in an interview with Time maga-
zine, Duderstadt said the University's classifica-
tion as a "state" university could be questionable,
given that state support has fallen below 10 per-
cent in recent years.
"It's always important to remember that the
University of Michigan is a public university,"
Duderstadt said. "You hear a lot of times that ...
we're privatizing the University, but my sense is


-14,
that's the wrong word to use."
"We have to take very seriously what our
public responsibilities are and those respon-
sibilities are changing," Duderstadt said. "All
of these great public universities are becom
ing more national in character, continuist
serve their state, but broadening out very sig-
nificantly and providing services to broader
constituencies."
In addition to national populations, Wool-
liscroft said the University stands to benefit
from new international relationships. While the
United States has been the worldwide leader in
medical researchsince the late 19th century, that
status may not be held for long.
"There's absolutely nothing to say that will
be the case in 20 or 30 years," Woolliscroft said.
"How do we position ourselves that the Universi-
ty of Michigan Medical School is a globally lead-
ing medical school in 2030?"
Woolliscroft predicted that, in the near future,
medical schools will fall into one of two catego-
ries: "global centers" or "niche players."
While the niche players will become profi-
cient in certain specialties, the global medical
systems will serve as epicenters of research and
collaboration for a large region.
"I think there will be 10 or 15 global medical
schools, that's one of the reasons we are con-
sciously setting up collaborations with superb
medical schools in China, Brazil, Ghana, India,"
Woolliscroft said. "I really think collaborajgn
like that on the global level is the future and
that's how you ensure that the school remains
relevant in 20 or 30 years."
These international partnerships, while
still in development, seek to broaden the reach
of UMHS to a scope never before seen at the
University - perhaps at any university. Orf )-
Woolliscroft put it: "The sun will never set on
the Block M."
