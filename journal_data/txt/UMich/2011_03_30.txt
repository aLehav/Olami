Construction plans
still need Board of
Regents approval
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
East Quad Residence Hall,
long-time home to the Residen-
tial College, will be temporar-
ily shutting its doors next year
while it undergoes a large-scale
construction project.
The renovations are expected
to start following the winter
2012 semester, with the resi-
dencehall reopening in time for
the fall 2013 semester, accord-
ing to LSA Associate Dean Phil
Deloria.
"It's going to be totally gutted
and taken apart, and it's going to
be beautiful when it's rebuilt,".
Deloria said.
During the construction, the
RC and the Michigan Communi-
ty Scholars Program, which will
be stationed in East Quad for the
second consecutive year, will be
moved to a different residence
hall. The exact location of the
move has yet to be determined,

Deloria said.
University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan wrote in an
e-mail interview that the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents must
approve the construction plans
before it begins.
"We have talked about the
timing of the project, depend-
ing on the scope of the work,
but decisions about such major
projects have to be reviewed
and recommended through the
executive leadership of the Uni-
versity and ultimately approved
by the regents," Logan wrote.
The tentative plans have
not been officially announced,
but some students have been
informed of the future renova-
tions.
"For several months, Univer-
sity Housing has been engaged
in preliminary studies about
upgrading East Quad, includ-
ing discussions with students
and faculty there," Logan wrote.
"It's a heritage building in need
of infrastructure improvements,
and we hope that there will be a
plan for East Quad."

struction is expected to take one

Students displeased
MCSP will not
return to Couzens
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
Participants of the Michigan
Community Scholars Program,
a University living and learning

community centered on com-
munity service, will continue to
live and learn in East Quad Resi-
dence Hall instead of returning
to the program's original home
in Couzens Residence Hall next
year.
MCSP was relocated to East
Quad this year. The program
was initially supposed to move
back to Couzens in the fall after
renovations to the buildings are

finished. But Phil Deloria, LSA
associate dean for undergradu-
ate education, said the decision
to keep MCSP in East Quad for
the long-term was made on Fri-
day after administrators from
the LSA Dean's Office deliber-
ated with University Housing
officials and MCSP leaders.
MCSP students were notified
that the program would remain
in East Quad via e-mail by MCSP

Director David Schoem on Sun-
day. Deloria said he and Schoem
agreed to keep the MCSP in East
Quad.
However, for the 2012-2013
school year, MCSP and the Resi-
dential College will be relocated
to another residence hall due
to future construction on East
Quad. The East Quad renova-
tions are scheduled to begin

'U' Center for Ethics to
close due to budget cuts

'IF YOU CAN DODGE A WRENCH...'

Elimination of
center will reduce
classes, programs
on topic
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
University students who
applied for fellowship programs
and research grants sponsored

by the University's Center for
Ethics in Public Life this year
were expecting to be granted or
denied their request.
Instead, they received an
e-mail that said due to recent
state government budget cuts,
the University has decided to
close the center entirely.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said due to budget
constraints determined by state
funding, certain University pro-
grams including the Center for

Ethics in Public Life were elimi-
nated. He said the center is not
closing because it failed to pro-
mote its message, but because it
had already met its goals.
"The evaluation was that
its mission of ethics in public
life was now sort of embedded
in the community," Fitzgerald
said. "And the provost's office
believed that would be sus-
tained without having a specific
center focused on that."

Learning and loving Latin

Where are you from and when
did you come to Michigan?
I am from Naples, Italy. I came to
Michigan in 2006 and started teach-
ing in 2007. I came to the United
States for the first time, just for a visit,
in 1993. I had a scholarship from the
Italian government to pursue an Ital-
ian doctorate. I visited Princeton, and
I loved Princeton so much thatI decid-
ed to apply to earn an American Ph.D.
in classics.
What classes do you teach at the
University?
I am teaching Classical Studies 121,
called "Africa, Race and Ethnicity in
the Ancient Mediterranean." I teach
how to talk about each other in a world
that is increasingly diverse as well as
the academic writing style. I am also

teaching Latin 232, which is on Virgil's
Aeneid. It is taught in Latin.
What is your teaching style like?
If I was observed teaching from
someone else's perspective I would
think I am very traditional, but maybe
not. When you tell someone how to
write you're basically telling people
how to think, so it's a little uncomfort-
able. But it's a very important skill. In
my class we are going to talk about
uncomfortable topics because you are
going to be evaluated about how you
think about these controversial topics.
What do you like most and least
about teaching?
Let me just start by saying I love
teaching. My favorite thing is the
exposure to young people and see-
ing how the world is changing with

them. When Ican see an idea spark in
somebody's head it is one of my great-
est pleasures. Seeing their ideas grow
as they discuss what they are thinking
with one another, I love that. When I
see knowledge happening I take great
pleasure. It's the reason I Ao what I do.
My least favorite partpis the sched-
ule. It kills me. Everything,sto hap-
pen at a specific time. I malge a very
strict plan at the beginning of the
semester, but I change it to give more
time to appreciate what the students
are learning. Grading is another least
favorite thing because it displeases
students that I am reducing their
learning to these little numbers. You
can't reduce anybody to a number.
Everybody is so complex and so rich.

Obama: Standardized tests
cause kids to lose interest

0

President says
school evaluations
shouldn't be based
only on test scores
WASHINGTON (AP) - Pres-
ident Barack Obama said Mon-
day that students should take
fewer standardized tests and
school performance should be
measured in other ways than
just exam results. Too much
testing makes education boring
for kids, he said.
"Too often what we have
been doing is using these tests
to punish students or to, in
some cases, punish schools,"
the president told students and
parents at a town hall hosted by
the Univision Spanish-language
television network at Bell Mul-
ticultural High School in Wash-
ington, D.C.

Obama, who is pushing a
rewrite of the nation's educa-
tion law that would ease some
of its rigid measurement tools,
said policymakers should find
a test that "everybody agrees
makes sense" and administer it
in less pressure-packed atmo-
spheres, potentially every few
years instead of annually.
At the same time, Obama
said, schools should be judged
on criteria other than student
test performance, including
attendance rate.
"One thing I never want to
see happen is schools that are
just teaching the test because
then you're not learning about
the world, you're not learning
about different cultures, you're
not learning about science,
you're not learning about math,"
the president said. "All you're
learning about is how to fill out
a little bubble on an exam and
little tricks that you need to do

in order to take a test and that's
not going to make education
interesting."
"And young people do well in
stuff that they're interested in,"
Obama said. "They're not going
to do as well if it's boring."
The president endorsed the
occasional administering of
standardized tests to determine
a "baseline" of student ability.
He said his daughters Sasha,
9, and Malia, 12, recently took
a standardized test that didn't
require advance preparation.
Instead, he said, it was just
used as a tool to diagnose their
strengths and weaknesses. The
girls attend the private Sidwell
Friends School in Washington.
Obama, who has been push-
ing his education agenda all
month, has expressed concern
that too many schools will be
unable to meet annual profi-
ciency standards under the No
Child Left Behind law this year.

Ultraconservative Muslim
sect more assertive in Egypt

Salafis served as
counterweight
to Mubarak's
opposition
CAIRO (AP) - Members of an
ultraconservative Muslim sect
clashed with villagers south
of Cairo over demands that a
liquor store and coffee shops be
closed, officials said yesterday,
a sign of the increasing asser-
tiveness of the fundamentalist
Salafi movement.
nOne villager was killed and
eight others were injured in the
armed clashes, which erupted
late Monday in the village of
Kasr el-Bassil in Fayoum prov-
ince, a security official said.

The fighting broke out after
Salafi followers ordered the
owner to close the liquor store
and coffee shops as they try
to forcibly impose their strict
interpretation of Islam by ban-
ning the drinking of alcohol.
Salafis were tolerated as a
religious group under ex-Pres-
ident Hosni Mubarak to coun-
terweight Mubarak's top foe,
the Muslim Brotherhood group
but has gained power as it rises
to play a more political role as
followers now ponder nominate
a presidential candidate, fol-
lowing the 18-day uprising that
led to the ouster of the former
regime. That has alarmed many
of the secular and liberal forces
in Egypt because of the group's
extremist discourse and imposi-
tion of Islamic sharia law.

Dozens of Salafis also staged
a protest yesterday in Cairo,
accusing the church of abduct-
ing Camilla Shehata, a Coptic
priest's wife who some believe
converted to Islam and is being
held against her will. Salafis also
have accused the police of col-
laborating with the church by
handing Shehata over to Church
authorities to reconvert them.
The woman's whereabouts are
currently unknown.
Such protests were held
almost weekly by the Salaf-
is over the summer as they
accused the Coptic Church of
conspiring to "Christianize"
Egypt, but they largely stopped
after a suicide bombing on New
Year's Day outside a Coptic
church in the port city of Alex-
andria killed 21 people.

300,000 Israeli
settlers currently
live in West Bank
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel is
considering annexing major West
Bank settlement blocs if the Pal-
estinians unilaterally seek world
recognition of a state, an Israeli
official said yesterday - moves
that would deal a grave blow to
prospects for negotiating a peace
deal between the two sides.
Israel has refrained from tak-
ing such a diplomatically explo-
sive step for four decades. The
fact that it is considering doing
so reflects how seriously it is
concerned by the Palestinian
campaign to win internation-
al recognition of a state in the
absence of peacemaking.
The Palestinians launched that
campaign after peace talks foun-
dered over Israeli construction in
West Bank settlements. Yester-
day, the Israeli Interior Ministry
said it would decide next month
whether to give final approval
to build 1,500 apartments in two
Jewish enclaves in east Jerusa-
lem. Israel captured both east

Jerusalem and the West Bank
from Jordan in 1967.
Israel annexed east Jerusa-
lem, home to shrines sacred to
Judaism, Islam and Christianity,
immediately after seizing it. But
it carefully avoided annexing the
West Bank, where 300,000 set-
tlers now live among 2.5 million
Palestinians.
Although it is widely assumed
that under any peace deal, Israel
would hold -nto major settle-
ments it has built in the past 44
years, any decision to formally
annex West Bank territory would
be a precedent-setting move that
could increase Israel's already
considerable international isola-
tion. The Palestinians claim all of
the West Bank and east Jerusa-
lem, in addition to the Gaza Strip,
for a future state.
The government official who
disclosed the possible annexation
said he did not know how seri-
ously authorities were considering
the option. He said that "adopting
unilateral measures is not a one-
way street" and added that other
options were also being consid-
ered.
These could include limiting
water supplies beyond agreed-
.

upon amounts and restricting
Palestinian use of Israeli ports for
business purposes, he said. Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netan-
yahu was aware of the moves
being discussed, he added, speak-
ing on condition of anonymity
because no final decisions have
been made.
Netanyahu's office had no com-
ment. Nimr Hamad, an aide to
Palestinian president Mahmoud
Abbas, said "these threats are not
new.... But we are continuing (our
campaign) and are convinced our
position is right."
In a related development, the
Israeli Transportation Min-
istry is working on a plan to
build an island off the coast of
Gaza, where an Palestinian-run
airport and seaport would be
located. Ministry spokesman
Ilan Leizerovich said this would
allow Israel to cut all ties with
Hamas-ruled Gaza.
At present most goods and peo-
ple enter and exit Gaza through
Israeli land crossings.
Leizerovich said the island
would be built about three miles
(4.5 kilometers) off the Gaza
coast and would be connected by
a bridge.

Opponents to
abortion endorse
more restrictive bill
Backers of an Ohio bill that

legal challenges.
Linda Theis (TYS') is a past
president of the state Right to Life
chapter speaking in favor of the

Theis said at a news conference

fetal viability.
A fetus is usually considered

Virginia Tech fined
$55K for response
to 2007 shooting
Virginia Tech will have to pay
the maximum $55,000 fine for
violating federal law by waiting
too long to notify students dur-
ing the 2007 shooting rampage,
the U.S. Department of Education
* announced yesterday.
Department officials said in a
letter to the school that the sanc-
tion should have been greater for
the school's slow response to the
deadliest mass shooting in mod-
ern U.S. history. The $55,000
fine was the most the department
could levy for Tech's two viola-
tions of the federal Clery Act,
which requires timely reporting
of crimes on campus.
"While Virginia Tech's viola-
tions warrant a fine far in excess
of what is currently permissible
under the statute, the Depart-

ment's fine authority is limited,"
wrote Mary Gust, director of a
department panel that dictated
what punishment the school
would receive for the violation.

ETHICS
From Page 1A
The center was founded on
July 1, 2008 in response to per-
ceived ethical lapses in public life
nationwide. Three years before it
became an official establishment,
it was a presidential initiative by
University President Mary Sue
Coleman.
At the time, Coleman cited vio-
lations of public ethics, such as
the mistreatment of prisoners in
Iraq, sexual abuse by priests and
government corruption, as impe-
tus for the creation of the center.
Coleman asked a University task
force to work toward a solution
that would promote ethics in aca-
demia and encourage a public dis-
course on ethics.
Once the center was founded, it
created a forum for applied ethics
by linking the specific schools and
areas of study at the University
that focus on ethics, according
to John Chamberlin, the center's
director and a professor in the
Ford School of Public Policy.
Though ethics-based programs
existed on campus before the cre-
ation of the center, the study of
ethics had not been directly con-
nected to the notion of applied
ethics, Chamberlin said. In addi-
tion to sponsoring courses on the
topic, the center also served indi-
vidual students, student groups
and administrative bodies inter-
ested in sponsoring events or
projects related to ethics through
program grants.
According to Chamberlin,
many other universities and aca-
demic institutions were motivat-
ed to establish centers as a result
of current events.
"They probably were spurred
by the headlines," he said, citing
centers that were founded after
historical crises such as Water-
gate and debates about World
War It.
Chamberlin said many eth-
ics centers focus on specific top-
ics like business, environmental
or military ethics or cater solely
e to graduate students and faculty
members. The University's center
was one of a few that extended its
0 reach to undergraduate students

and encompassed many disci-
plines, he said.
LSA Associate Dean Derek
Collins, a member of the center's
executive board, said he believes
the center has accomplished
much since its inception. Collins
added that he thinks the Univer-
sity's budget constraints have no
bearing on the success of the cen-
ter and that the center's closure
does not reflect its effectiveness
as a program.
"Chamberlin's leadership has
been exemplary," Collins said.
"We've done greatthings over the
last five years, and no one should
regret all the great work that
we've all done."
Though the center is closing,
Chamberlin said he doesn't think
the services it offers will disap-
pear. But without the center as
a guide, students will have to do
more personal work to discover
the resources and connections
to pursue projects and programs
concerning applied ethics, he
said.
Fitzgerald said many of the
programs that were started bythe
Center for Ethics in Public Life,
like the University's Ethics Bowl
Team - which debates topics per-
taining to ethics and participated
in a debate last week with the vice
president of the People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals -
will continue.
However, some programs will
not be sustained without the
center. Research and fellowship
programs that gave funding to
professors, undergraduate stu-
dents and pre- and post-disser-
tation graduate students will no
longer be available.
Nancy Baum, an analytic con-
sultant at the University's Cen-
ter for Healthcare Research and
Transformation, received a fel-
lowship grant from the center for
her work in public health and eth-
ics when she was as a Ph.D. candi-
date. Baum said it was important
for her to have the funding and
the opportunity to engage in a
series of meetings with other
fellows doing dissertation work
related to applied ethics.
"We had an opportunity to
share our work with each other,"
she said. "And we were able

to enrich our own work while
understanding other people's
work in applied ethics."
Baum added that while some
philosophy classes include the
discussion of theoretical ethics,
courses about its application are
absent in higher education.
"I think the Center for Ethics in
Public Life filled a very important
hole that's missing for an awful
lot of people around the Univer-
sity in various departments who
are interested in applied ethics,"
she said. "And I think that's going
to be quite a loss."
Additionally, funding avail-
able to professors who wanted
to supplement their curriculum
with speakers or events related to
ethics will no longer be available.
Henry Greenspan, a lecturer
in clinical psychology, said the
center helped him secure funding
to get important lecturers in his
classes, which included a Resi-
dential College class titled "Spe-
cial Topics: Pills, Politics and the
Public Good."
"These are not just folks drop-
ping in," he said. "They are
speakers who make an enormous
difference in the course."
Greenspan also said he was
upset to hear about the loss of the
center.
"It's sad, above all, for the stu-
dents who will have to work a
little harder to find the relevant
courses and create programs on
their own," he said.
But Collins said he believes the
center's closing is an invitation for
all University members to seek
new ways to promote the discus-
sion of ethics.
"Not every interdisciplinary
conversation is funneled through
a center," Collins said. "I think
maybe this is a call to arms to find
a new way to continue that inter-
disciplinary conversation."
Despite Chamberlin's unhappi-
ness with the center's closing, he
said he still wants to help facili-
tate discussion about applied eth-
ics on campus.
"tm disappointed," he said.
"But this year and last year we've
done a lot. The question is, does it
have momentum, and howcan we
diffuse this throughout the Uni-
versity so it can continue?"

Rein i administrator pay
Public universities must keep spending realistic
t's no secret that Michigan has been facing serious economic
hardships lately and the University is no exception. With all the
changes that have been implemented to stabilize a struggling
state economy, Michigan has made many budget cuts, and higher edu-
cation is unfortunately one of them. But spending on administrator
positions at universities throughout the state has somehow escaped
the budget cuts. And with more and more students being priced out
of education because of less state funding and rising tuition rates, it
doesn't seem appropriate that the salaries of professors and adminis-
trative employees continue to climb so drastically. While it's impor-
tant to attract the best people with competitive salaries and account
for increased enrollment, it's also a priority to keep spending realistic.
Public universities need to cut back on their employee compensation
increases to help alleviate tuition costs for students.

Doing Birthright right

According to a March 27 Detroit Free Press
article, in the last five years spending on uni-
versity administrators has gone up almost 30
percent, and faculty compensation has risen
22 percent among the state's 15 public uni-
versities. The University has had a 27 percent
increase in spending, which includes new
hires as well as salary increases. Grand Val-
ley State University has increased spending
on administrators by 48 percent and Michigan
State University has increased its administra-
tive spending 41 percent. Amid claims of cut-
ting expenses and more frugal measures from
Michigan's public universities, this is a glaring
incongruity. Tuition continues to rise every
year, and when families are facing salary cut-
backs and losing jobs, it's going to be very dif-
ficult for themto digest the salary increases of
university employees.
University President Mary Sue Coleman
states in the Free Press article that the Uni-
versity needs the best employees to stay
competitive, yet administrative salaries are
increasing much more than faculty salaries
throughout the state. The backbone of any
university is the faculty. They're the people
who are directly responsible for a student's

education, and yet they're receiving less com-
pensation increases than administrators.
There is a clear lack of balance between what
it takes to recruit talented administrators
versus talented faculty.
With more budget cuts to come, the Univer-
sity has to be prepared for decreased funding
from the state. Even small cuts in financial
aid would be devastating to many students.
Compensation and tuition increases cannot
continue at the same pace without students
facing serious roadblocks to their education.
Reduced funding is the reality the University
is facing, and the compensation spending must
be reined in before the costs outmatch student
capacities to pay.
Obviously higher enrollments at universi-
ties require more administrators and faculty
members, but to keep education affordable
and accessible, the administration and teach-
ers at Michigan universities must share the
current economic burden with their students.
The future is going to be tough for Michigan
and the nation as a whole, and there needs to
be more awareness of this on the University's
part to avoid pricing Michigan's students out
of education.

ong Island, what the
fuck?" Had the video
emerged on the Inter-
net at the time,
that scene from
"Pursuit of Jap-
piness" - a video
produced by Uni-
versity students
that went viral
on the Internet
this semester
- would have ERIK
popped into TORENBERG
my mind at a
moment when I
couldn'timagine anything else at Yad
Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum.
The reminder of self-aware hedo-
nism would have elicited a chuckle
when I was experiencing an inability
to empathize with my grandfather's
experiences. Not a chuckle symbol-
izing genuine laughter, but cynicism
as I compared the opportunities of
my grandfather's generation to mine.
Had I left the exhibit and boarded
that Birthright bus two years later,
I would have questioned: Are "Jap-
piness" and Jewishness mutually
exclusive? How much do I want to be
associated with either? Is it even fair
to make that dichotomy?
To realize something so raw and
humbling - that I'll never be able
to put myself in my grandfather's
shoes - and then to be on a bus
(unsuccessfully) living the lifestyle
that was portrayed in the video was
unsettling. That video brought my
Birthright trip back to life perhaps
because it wasn't really a parody.
That lifestyle seems so incongruent
with what I believe to be the Jewish
values I grew up with. I didn't share
my discomfort during the Birthright
circle discussions because it seemed
like the trip leaders wanted to hear
affirmations, not uncertainty. In the
future, I would tell others thatI loved
my Birthright experience, just not in
the way I was supposed to.
After Birthright finished, I stayed

in the country and visited family. I
told my cousin stories from college,
answering questions about nightlife
but qualifying that there is more to
college than what he's seen from
movies. He told me about his army
experience, recounting stories of
unimaginable training missions and
friends who lost limbs. Family mem-
bers offered (blunt) sentiments as
to what I should know about Israel.
With my cousin leading the way, I
experienced a less edited version of
the country my father grew up in.
They say a conversation with two
Israelis will lead to seven politi-
cal parties. Although I didn't know
much about the country's conflicts at
the time I was in Israel, I sure acted
as if I did, reiterating pocket argu-
ments I've heard from Israeli adults
all my life. In time, I would learn
about the White Papers, the rise of
the Palestine Liberation Organiza-
tion and the settlements. In doing so,
I realized that some young Israelis
- people undergoing rigorous army
training - knew little history or only
knew it from one side. Personally, the
more I learned aboutthe conflictthat
defines the everyday for some of my
family, the less I knew.When pressed
for a concrete opinion, I often said
some variation of "I don'tknow, man.
It's complex."
But I didn't experience ideologi-
cal diversity on Birthright. I partied
five nights and told others that I felt
"more Jewish." I didn't really feel
a genuine sense of belonging until
I explored Israel on my own terms.
But perhaps I'm expecting too much
from a free 10-day trip. Although I
believe the trip panders to spring
break getaway whims, I understand
that the organization's motives - to
connect American Jews with Israel
- are prudent. I'm grateful that it
exists. I just don't think the trip has
to be branded as a vacation in Cancun
with some spirituality.
When I go back to Israel, I'd like to
engage with people who have experi-

enced firsthand what we learn in our
history textbooks, as well as those
who have different perspectives on
those historical events. The end goal
of a trip like Birthright should be for
American Jews to have a multifacet-
ed understanding of the significance
of and complexityinherent in having
a Jewish nation. Participants should
have abetterunderstandingofIsraeli
culture and lifestyle and how certain
historical events have defined it.
They should also have an amazing
time in avariety of different settings.
Birthright gives ataste of all of these,
but it seems to focus on the latter.
My trip to
Israel could have I
meant more.

My cousin and I came up with a
generalized hypothesis to explain
some of the dissonance we noticed
between Americans and Israelis of
our generation: Israeli kids grew up
with the justified narrative that their
country was always under attack.
They serve their country out of duty,
as a measure of self-defense. Many
have responded to that narrative.
American kids grew up with the
narrative that life is short, post-col-
lege work life is boring and oppor-
tunities for experimenting at college
are limitless as well as numbered.
They've seen the movies;they've
seen their older brother's photos.
Their parents reminisce about care-
free college life, and they want to be
able to do the same. They, too, have
responded to their own narratives.

NICHOLAS ZETTEL I
Care about apathy

In New York, as many of you know, there
is a certain political party that has one mes-
sage, and that message is encapsulated in the
party's name. The name of this party is "the
rent is too damn high" party. Its issue, as could
be perceived, is that the rent in New York is in
fact too damn high. The reason I bring this up
is I believe the Michigan Student Assembly
needs a new party to compete with Mforward.
This party will be called "The ticket prices are
too damn high" party.
I'm going to be honest right now. The real-
ity of the situation is that tickets to college
football games are not supposed to be cheap.
According to a March 24 Daily article, non-
students pay almost twice what we pay, we're
paying somethinglike 30 bucks a ticket, which
is really not that bad in the grand scheme of
things. Having said all that, I have some issues
with the University's Athletic Department
raising prices. The first is selfish, and the sec-
ond is more universal.
First things first - I'm broke. I'm a college
student. I'm not exactly depositing money in
a bank account every week, and the amount
of money that is lying around for extras like
watching Michigan play football (one of the
joys of a college experience) isn't exactly huge.
Our friends to the north in East Lansing pay
$10 per ticket. Other students in the Big Ten
are paying between five and 15 bucks. I'm not
goingto mention the fact that THE Ohio State
University's ticket prices are higher because it
both weakens my argument and involves men-

tioning Ohio State University...
I love football. I love the beauty of a pull-
ing guard, the wonder of a play action fake
that works just right, and the roar of the crowd
when sophomore quarterback Denard Robin-
son makes a linebacker look foolish. I also love
paying for the heat in my house and for tuition.
Overall, I'm going to restate the fact that I
believe prices are too damn high.
The second issue I have with the rise in
ticket prices comes from University Athletic
Department spokesman Dave Ablauf's inter-
view with The Michigan Daily. In an e-mail
interview, Ablauf wrote that even if some
people don't renew their tickets "the student
section as a whole will probably sell out" and
bragged that there is a "robust waiting list if
some decline to renew their season tickets."
I don't know about you, but I find these
comments very offensive. He is saying that
the Athletic Department doesn't care if you
can't stomach the thought of paying $240
for tickets, because someone else will, and
if it's not you watching the first night game
in Michigan Stadium history in the fall, it
doesn't matter because there will still be
more than 100,000 fans in the Big House. The
Athletic Department doesn't care if you're in
the seat because you love the game, just that
you're willing to pay more to sit there, and
that is the reason the season ticket prices are
too damn high.

Michigan Daily columnist Jeremy Levy makes it
clear in a recent column (Don't compare 2011 to 1960
02/24/2011) that our generation should not attempt to
recreate the activism of 1960's because our problems
today are so drastically different. For this reason, Levy
believes that criticism of student apathy is unwarranted
and irrelevant. The problem is, there are still detrimen-
tal problems within every facet of our society. So where
does this apathy come from? How is it measured? The
choice by the majority of our generation not to vote is
hardly a qualifying factor indicative of our generation's
political apathy. Let us not forget that 2008 yielded the
highest youth voter turnout since 1972. Around two
years ago, it appeared as though our "generation" (give
or take a few years) was more motivated than ever. And
all for something as simple as "change," the harmonic
buzzword loaded with utopian undertones. Our voters
turn their backs on any political responsibility as soon
as they leave the voting booth. The fact that the 2010
midterm elections yielded a significantly lower num-
ber of voters under age 30 than the presidential election
underscores our youth's lazy assertion of political influ-
ence. It's disheartening to see so many youth get up in
arms for "change," while many only cared enough to try
and change the face of the man behind the curtain.
Activism is not solely a means of political expres-
sion or a symbol of bandwagon politics. Activism is a
crucial tool ingrained in our political system and is as
American as our right not to vote. The Boston Tea Party,
John Brown's rebellion, the March on Washington and
the Million Man March are just a few examples of red,
white and blue-blooded activism varying in extremity.
Though it may seem unjust to compare today's political
happenings with the American Revolution and the Civil
Rights Movement, America is not perfect, and we are in
dire need of improvement. What would any movement
matter if neither the standard of living nor quality of life
were improved and maintained afterward? We cannot
just give blacks the same rights as whites and expect our
issues of racism to diminish just as we cannot expect our
deficit and war issues to go away because we voted in a
Democrat two and a half years ago.
Furthermore, Levy claims that our political climate is
more stable than that of the 60s and thus does not neces-

sitate extreme activism. This is the mentality that breeds
apathy and inhibits understanding. Nobody should sit
idly by until some egregious event calls for immediate
action. Levy feels that the activism is glorified and over
simplified, and we should therefore not hold ourselves
to those standards. Though I agree our generation's lack
of concern and greater lack of action is undeserving of
the critical comparison it draws, I don't think anybody
ever thought it would be easyto make even the slightest
amount of change, and nobody today should expect any
different. The youth of the decade long gone shouldn't
be our only role models though. We see young people out
and about in Egypt and Wisconsin alike because they
feel they are being wronged. If we shouldn't compare
our student activism to that of the 60s, let's compare
our generational counterparts across the globe. People
who bemoan the 60s don't understand that those activ-
ists paved the way for LGBT, HIV/AIDS, feminist and
NAACP activists of the 80s and 90s, just to name a few.
Student apathy is not bemoaned because it doesn't live
up to the 60s; it is lamented because it doesn't live up to
its potential.
Levy also maintains that rallies like those seen in
Wisconsin "take place when most people involved have
something to lose." Aside from stating the obvious,
Levy is discrediting those unaffected, yet sympathetic
to the cause. Let's not forget or downplay the role the
white-middle class youth played in the activism of the
60s. People saw injustice all around them, and that moti-
vated them to protest, lobby, march and educate others
through art, music, literature and community. Many of
this day and age's disaffected youth are satisfied with
linking an article with some pictures to their status. Oth-
ers do take the time to stage protests, lobby and arrange
educational events, and then send out mass invites to
everybody within reach. Still, you'd be hard pressed to
wander into a University auditorium that has reached
full capacity. Although plenty are motivated, most are
apathetic, and that's the problem. So check your invites,
and don't just click 'attending.' Attend. Learn where you
stand and what surrounds you. Sometimes it even means
a free meal.

sive through-
out his canon of work. Starting
tomorrow, the University's School
of Music, Theatre & Dance will
return to Miller's universal
themes with the premiere of "The
Crucible."
Written as an allegory to the
1950s McCarthy era, "The Cru-
cible" focuses on a community
enveloped by mass hysteria and
fear during the Salem Witch Tri-
* als of 1692. But the upcoming pro-
duction, while paying homage to
McCarthyism's original influence,
veers in a different direction from
traditional stereotypes.
"We're going away from witch-
craft and communism. It's about
the manipulation of power," assis-
tant director and MT&D junior
Doron Bloomfield said.
According to Bloomfield, the
timelessness of the play is appli-
cable to today's world, not only in a
broad scope, but also in the small-
er, intimate interactions that often
go overlooked due to its signifi-
cant stature in American dramatic
history. Scenes like the break-up
between Proctor and Abigail prove
relatable to a college audience.
In keaping with this viewthe
cast andltrewhave contemporized
this "Crucible" to present what
director and MT&D assistant
professor Jerry Schwiebert refers
to as "classic now," a distillation
of the play to its essential parts.
As opposed to a literal adherence
to the text, the show's look and
feel are set in three distinct time
zones: Puritan New England, the
McCarthy era and the present day.
"The set is here and now, but
it's not Ann Arbor, 2011," said
MT&D senior Adam McCarthy,
the show's scenic and lighting
designer. "It's relevant, but there's
no specific context."
McCarthy and MT&D senior
Marguerite Woodward,theshow's
costume designer, have worked to

tarian function for the actors. To
achieve this, clothing and lighting
were essential in creating an open
space for the actors to tell their
story, as opposed to placing them
in a true-to-life 1692 court case.
"The set itself is pretty bare,"
McCarthy said. "But each prop
adds meaning and theme. It was
importantto let the set be a canvas
for adding props, light and actors."
When Miller directed his own
version of the play, he too believed
in a simplistic structure. In his
autobiography, "Timebends,"
Miller states the influence on his
own writing of the Greek struc-
tural concept, wherein the past
and present intertwine - theater

As a student at the University
from 1935 to 1939, Miller stud-
ied journalism while honing his
writing abilities. In 1936, he won
the first of two Hopwood Awards
for drama. Studying under the
laste professor Kenneth Rowe, a
renowned University playwriting
instructor, Miller developed his
belief in the underlying dramatic
structure inherentin alldrama,
from antiquityto the modern era.
Yet it was only when he left Ann
Arbor and encountered injustice
firsthand that Miller formed the
basis of his Tony Award-winning
play.
Miller and other notable mem-
bers of the New York-based
Group Theater were called to
testify before the House Un-
American Activities Committee.
Miller refused to "cooperate"
and was sentenced to jail for con-
tempt. He then traveled to Salem,
Mass. to research the seventeenth-
century Witch Trials for what
would become a scathing attack on
McCarthy's own witch hunt of sus-
pected communist sympathizers.
Today, University students con-
tinue to study and perform this
material written over 50 years
ago. More than history or politics,

what motivates the cast and crew
is a chance to discover new ele-
ments behind the text.
"When you start to strip away
the layers of politics and religion,
you find that as much as someone
may appearto be driven by an idea,
they're actually driven by very
human factors," Adam McCarthy
said of the play's development in
rehearsal. "At the end of the day,
everyone is in fact a sympathetic
character."
Nowhere could be more appro-
priate than Ann Arbor for a stag-
ing of what Miller referred to as
his "most theatrical piece." As
an active alumnus, Miller cared
deeply for the institution thatgave
him his start, and lent his name to
only one theater during his life-
time: The Arthur Miller Theatre
in the Walgreen Drama Center on
North Campus, where this pro-
duction will take place.
Specifically, Miller took an
active interest in the students of
the University, even after gaining
fame and recognition. In decid-
ing which play to choose for the
spring season, Schwiebert empha-
sized a desire to incorporate as
many students into the production
as possible. With a cast of 20, "The
Crucible" has provided ample
opportunities for student actors.
"This play offers the most parts,
especially female parts, out of any
of his other plays," Schwiebert
said.
Audiences can expect the story
they know, but shouldn't expect
an overarching socio-political
pretext. The production con-
cerns itself with the fundamental
nature of Miller's play: the little
moments and struggles that com-
prise a life. With political context
stripped away, the final product
should remind us of the power a
great Miller drama can bring to
the theater.
"I hope people come away say-
ing, 'Oh my god, Miller knows how
to write a play,' " Woodward said.

It wasn't always this way.
Britney's anonymity has always
followed her, but it was a dis-

slight Southern twang, blonde

"mama." Britney was vacuous
and comfortably sexual, famil-

One shaved head and two
kids later, Britney's rounding 30
and single, and not much other
than perception has changed.
2006's Blackout more or less
shrugged off her public melt-
downs, matching her slithering
come-ons to Timbaland protege
Danja's cerebral future funk
and Bloodshy & Avant's taut pop
on "Toxic." On "Gimme More,"
"It's Britney, bitch" felt absurd,
with or without the comma,
because stepping back, you had
to wonder if you ever knew who
she was to begin with.
It would be an exaggeration
to call Blackout a pop master-
piece, irony be damned, but the
album more or less deserves it.
The production and cohesion
of it was and still is stunning.

harmonious and evocative. Such
a disposition leaves the album in
a gray area of enjoyment - some-

it's awkward, but often it's just
flat and uninteresting.
All Eternals Deck begins with
tempting promise. The first
track, "Damn These Vampires,"
is undeniably uplifting, and is
emphasized by piano chords that
become progressively more bold
and resolute. However, even in

"I think we're under recog-
nized for the scope, the scale,
the impact and the value of what
we do in research," Lampe said.
"My role will be to help U of M
get the recognition it deserves
for the excellence of the research
it does do regionally, nationally
and internationally."
Lampe first came to the Uni-
versity to serve as the vice presi-
dent for communications in 2007.
His responsibilities included
overseeing the University News
Service, Office of Public Affairs,
Freedom of information Office,
MCSP
From Page 1A
sometime after the winter 2012
semester and end before the
beginning of the fall 2013 semes-
ter, accordingto Deloria.
He added that the two pro-
grams are set to continue operat-
ing side-by-side during the hiatus
from East Quad.
Marjorie Horton, LSA assistant
dean for undergraduate education,

University publications, speech-
writing for University executives
and the design and content of the
University's gateway website.
Lampe said his new position is
something he's had "in the back
of (his) mind" and will allow him
to devote more of his expertise to
communicating the University's
research.
"I've coordinated a lot of
communications and activities
surrounding the University's
stated goal to help catalyze the
transformation of the econo-
my," Lampe said. "It's relatively
recently that in conversations,
in particular with Steve For-
rest, that it'd be worth devoting
more resources to that particular
and Deloria met with the MCSP
students yesterday to address their
concerns about the future of the
program. At the meeting, Deloria
offered the students his apologies
for such late notice on the hous-
ing changes. Students expressed
disappointment that they'll be liv-
ing in East Quad again since they
were looking forward to residing
in Couzens next year.
LSA sophomore Andy Clark
said he had two main worries.
He said he's concerned the stu-

aspect of our mission."
University President Mary
Sue Coleman wrote in a Univer-
sity press release last week that
Lampe has excelled in his cur-
rent position and will succeed in
his new job.
"David has been a delightful
colleague and has led the Uni-
versity through many challeng-
ing issues while buildinga strong
foundation for continuing inno-
vation in communications and
marketing at Michigan," Cole-
man wrote. "I wish him well in
this new endeavor and know that
recognition for the importance
and impact of U-M's research
enterprise will be strengthened
under his guidance."
dents weren't involved in the deci-
sion and MCSP's identity will be
affected. Clark said he appreciates
the optimism from the adminis-
tration, but the current situation is
less than ideal.
Engineering sophomore Tony
Lucchesi, a future MCSP student
leader, also attended the meeting
held by Deloria and Horton. Luc-
chesi said the situation at East
Quad could be improved with the
addition of more lounges and bet-
ter access to wireless Internet, but

University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said Forrest created
the new position Lampe will
assume because the University's
research enterprise becomes
larger each year. University
research spending topped $1 bil-
lion for the second consecutive
year in 2010.
"(Forrest) saw a role for a
much more closer working rela-
tionship with someone to com-
municate that on a variety of
different levels and work closely
with him to get that message
out," Fitzgerald said.
With masters degrees in jour-
nalism and mechanical engi-
neering, Fitzgerald said the new
position fits all of Lampe's inter-
said he still has some concerns
about how the renovations will
impact the program.
"The worst-case scenario
would be that MCSP, you know,
kind of loses its identity, and it
loses interestbecause the facilities
we are in aren't conducive to the
program," Lucchesi said.
Deloria said he would share
student suggestions with Univer-
sity Housing and those in charge
of construction. He said MCSP
students should take advantage

ests.
"The more (Lampe and For-
rest) talked about it, the more
David realized that this was real-
ly his passion ..." Fitzgerald said.
"(Research) is an area that's very
close to his heart. He believes
in research and technology, and
it's an area that he knows a lot
about."
Lampe earned his masters
degree in mechanical engineer-
ing in 1976 from the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology and
his masters degree in journalism
in 1981 from Stanford University.
Prior to coming to the University
of Michigan, Lampe served as
executive director of marketing
and communications at the Har-
of this opportunity to shape East
Quad's forthcoming updates and
the future of the program.
"We know that we're asking
a lot of you guys," Deloria said.
"And so we want to do everything
we possibly can to ameliorate and
mitigate the situation."
Additionally, LSA will move the
Lloyd Hall Scholars Program to
Couzens while Alice Lloyd Resi-
dence Hall is being renovated next
year.
Deloria said LHSP, MCSP and

vard University Business School,
a position he assumed in 2002.
Fitzgerald said there is cur-
rently no time frame to find
a permanent replacement for
Lampe in the Office of the Vice
President of Communications.
"President Coleman asked
Kallie Michels to step into that
role temporarily," Fitzgerald
said. "As far as I know, there
hasn't been the conversation to
move that forward yet beyond
that point."
Before she became associate
vice president for communica-
tions in 2008, Michels had been
the director of public relations
for the University of Michigan
Health System since 2000.
the RC were supposed to be placed
together in East Quad, but after
meeting with architects and his
colleagues in University Housing,
officials realized this would make
the living situation too crowded.
He added that he thinks MCSP
and the RC are a strong fit given
their community-oriented goals,
which is what pushed the decision
to keep them under the same roof.
,"We think the possibilities and
payoffs here are great," Deloria
said.

Softball Preview 2011
Unsung heroes will contribute to No. 3 Michigan's success

By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
When the No. 3 Michigan
softball team is mentioned,
there are typically two seniors
who come to mind: shutout
pitcher Jordan Taylor and slug-
ger Dorian Shaw.
The two captains have led the
Wolverines over their past four
years, both at the plate and on
the dirt.
But these two seniors are
not alone in leading this year's
squad. There are several unsung
heroes who have stepped up in
2011.
They range in position, age
and responsibility, but these
players all have one thing in
common - they have saved the
day more than once this season.
In May last season, the
Wolverines were matched
up against Tennessee for the
NCAA Super Regional game.
Shaw was up to bat and hit
a wicked line drive foul, right
into the Michigan dugout, mak-
ing contact with then-sopho-
more center fielder Bree Evans's
right arm.
Evans should be called the
"comeback kid."
The junior centerfielder has
had her fair share of obstacles
during her tenure at Michigan.
After being sidelined for the
winter by a collision at home
plate during an exhibition game
in Oct. 2009 against Michigan

State, Evans shocked everyone
by not only getting back to the
field by spring, but also by earn-
ing All-Big Ten, Conference first,
team honors.
She missed only one game her
entire sophomore stint - the
Tennessee game.

Big Ten Preview: Who's a
legitimate threat to 'M'?

Senior pitcherJordan Taylor may be one of the best pitchers in the country.
Blue poised for a deep playoff run

By MATT RUDNITSKY
Daily Sports Writer
The No. 4 Michigan softball
team is off to a scorching start,
including recent triumphs over
No. 6 Arizona State and No. 7 Ari-
zona. .
And as the cold-weather, Big
Ten teams are finally returning
home for spring and the start of
conference play, Michigan (2-0
Big Ten, 31-2 overall) is the only
team with more than 19 wins.
The Wolverines have won the
Big Ten title in 13 of the past 19
years - including the past three -
and having lost only eight confer-
ence games inthe pastthree years,
are heavy favorites once again.
Here's the softball beat's Big
Ten preview, giving you the low-
down for each conference team.
THE CREAM OF THE CROP
No. 4 Michigan Wolverines
The Wolverines are the only
ranked team in the Big Ten and
started off the conference season
with a sweep of Northwestern last
weekend.
Led by two preseason, first-
team All-Americans in senior
pitcher Jordan Taylor and senior
first baseman Dorian Shaw, Mich-
igan is not only a threat to win the
conference, but a national title,
too.

sport that has seen just nine other
champions (and none east of Texas
A&M), that's quite an accomplish-
ment. And this team won't be sat-
isfied with anything less.
"Our expectations don't change
based on what year it is," Shaw
said before the season."We always
want to win the Big Ten Champi-
onship and go to the World Series.
"We want to play in the Nation-
al Championship game, and while
it will obviously take a little bit of
luck here and there, we have the
talent to get there."
THE LEGITIMATE THREATS
Illinois Fightinglllini
The Illini struggled early but
started off their Big Ten season by
sweepingaMichigan State.
Illinois is coming off of an
appearance in the NCAA tourna-
ment and was ranked No. 24 in the
preseason.
Player to watch: Junior first
baseman Meredith Hackett
Hackett (418 batting average,
16 home runs, 56 RBI) was a First
Team All-American lastyear.
Opponents have attempted to
pitch around herthis year (17 BB, 2
HBP), but that still hasn't stopped
her from smacking five home runs
and tallying 22 RBI.
If the rest of the Illini's lineup
can turn things around and give
her some protection, Illinois will

Penn State Nittany Lions
Boasting two pitchers with
sub-two ERAs, the Nittany Lions
are goingto be in just about every
game this year.
They've recorded impressive
wins over No. 9 Oklahoma and
Fresno State (which beat Michi-
gan), but a team that averages just
over two runs per game is going to
find it hard to stringtogether alot
of wins.
Players to watch: Junior pitcher
Lisa Akamine and redshirt senior
pitcher Jackie Hill
As long Akamine (6-5, 1.22
ERA) and Hill (9-6, 1.87 ERA) are
on the mound, Penn State will be
tough to score on.
Northwestern Wildcats
The Wildcats held leads in both
games against Michigan in their
season-opening series but were
edged 2-1 and 7-4.
Just hanging with Michigan
shows how dangerous Northwest-
ern can be tothe rest ofthe league.
Players to watch: Sophomore
shortstop Emily Allard, junior
first baseman Adrienne Monka
and sophomore pitcher Megan
Lamberth
The Wildcats have a solid
offense led by Allard (.500 avg, 23
SB) and Monka (.463 batting aver-
age, .667 on-base percentage, 7
home runs, 25 RBI).
Their pitchingstaff (2.98 team-
ERA) is highlighted by Lamberth
(7-0, 2.58 ERA).

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan softball team is
a perennial powerhouse - reload-
ing constantly with no such thing
as a rebuilding year. After all, the
program hasn't had a losing sea-
son in its 33-year existence.
This year is no different. The
tools are there for a postseason
run, but before that can happen,
Michigan must overcome a treach-
erous Big Ten schedule filled with
teams foaming at the mouth to get
a shot at the Wolverines.
"Just being Michigan, there is
always a target on your back no
matter where you go," senior hurl-
er Jordan Taylor said. "There's
definitely a target during Big
Tens."
Even with a very talented ros-
ter, a lot will need to go right
for Michigan (2-0 Big Ten, 31-2
overall) to win its fourth straight
conference crown. Here's a break-
down of Michigan's star hitters
and pitchers, both of which are
needed to be outstanding in order
to contend for a national title.
THE BATS: Michigan knows
how to manufacture runs. And
though Big Ten pitchers may not
allow the Wolverines to score at
will like they did against non-con-
ference foes, Michigan has the hit-
ting to keep up every game.
It starts with senior first base-
man Dorian Shaw. Shaw reaches

base roughly 60 percent of the
time, touching them all frequent-
ly. She also leads the team with 11
home runs and is in hot pursuit
of the all-time Michigan record,
a total held by Samantha Findlay.
She has enjoyed a tremendous
career as a Wolverine, winning
a Big Ten title in each of her sea-
sons. There have also been plenti-
ful individual accolades for Shaw
- she has been a member of all-
conference teams and was an All-
American last year.
With such a bigbat in the heart
of the Michigan order, the option
of issuing Shaw a free pass cer-
tainly weighs on the mind of
opposing coaches. But after seeing
who stands in the on-deck circle,
this thought is usually erased.
Junior utility player Amanda
Chidester slugs at a rate not far
from Shaw and is also a home-run
threat. Hitting in the cleanup spot,
Chidester has provided a spark for
the Wolverines at the most oppor-
tune times. Last weekend in Evan-
ston, her grand slam triggered a
comeback win over Northwest-
ern. This clutch hitting is exactly
the type of hitting that could lead
Michigan to some late-game hero-
ics and a magical season.
THE ARMS: The Michigan
pitching staff is anchored by Tay-
lor who is, arguably, the best in
the country. But the other half of
the starting pitchingtandem plays
just as crucial a role in the Wolver-

Ines' success.
When the season ends, Tay-
lor will be passing the ace title to
sophomore Stephanie Speierman
who, like her predecessor, has
been brilliant so far this season.
And it bodes well for Michigan
that Speierman has been there
to share the load. Keeping Tay-
lor in early-season form come the
postseason has been a priority for
coach Carol Hutchins.
"We want Taylor as fresh as she
can be when it's May," Hutchins
said. "(Speierman) continues to
get better."
But in last weekend's sweep of
the Wildcats, Speierman didn't
make an appearance. Rather, Tay-
lor shouldered the weight, setting
a perfect example for Speierman
who is expected to be called upon
frequently during Big Ten games.
"I chatted with Speierman
(Tuesday)," Hutchins said. "I said,
'That's not going to be the norm.
It's not goingto be Taylor pitching
every Big Ten game."'
Both hurlers seem extremely
confident, averaging slightly more
than one run surrendered per
game. Hits have been tough to
come by against the pair, but that
doesn't mean they feel triumphant
yet.
"We haven't quite dominated
like this before, so everybody's
gunning for us but we're always
ready for it," Taylor said. "We
don't take any opponent for grant-
ed."

The Wolverines have only one be tough to beat.

random student Interview bysarahsquire

elcome to the Ran-
dom Student Inter-
view, where the line
between journalistic integ-
rity and personal boundar-
ies becomes blurred. Who is
DeAndree Watson?
Uh, the new MSA president.
Who is Brendan Campbell?
The new vice president.
Can you name three things
MSA does?
No.
What is your take on JELL-O
shots?
I like them.
Are you going to get down on
Friday? Are you looking for-
ward to the weekend, week-
end? Friday, Friday?
Yes.
Do you like Backstreet Boys?
Yes. But *NSYNC's better.
Really? Why?
I don't know. They were just bet-
ter when I was akid.
Were they hotter?
Yes.
Did your mom buy you CDs for
them?
Yes, I went to the concert.
You went to the *NSYNC con-
cert?
Yes, in sixth grade.
Did you rip off your shirt?
Throw it around?
No.
Did anything exciting happen?
I was on the upstairs. I couldn't

jump on the stage. I made a sign
for Justin Timberlake though.
What did it say?
I don't know, like "I love you JT."
Something along that.
What is Twitter?
Social networking?
Do you tweet?
No.
Would you ever tweet?
Yeah.
Do you know why people
tweet?
No.
Why would you tweet then?
If I had anything important to
say.
You think it's for people with
important things to say?
It should be, but it's not.
Why should it be?
Cause if you have ideas you should
get them out there, but -
Shouldn't you hold them to
yourself as intellectual prop-
erty? You don't want someone
else to steal your idea. Imagine
if you tweeted about this like
great new idea, you know-
But not like revolutionary ideas
just like what you think, like
political -
Political - so all political
thoughts should be said?
No, not necessarily in that forum.
Well what types of political
shows do you watch or listen
to?
I watch News Nightly and Ste-

phen Colbert. John Stewart I
watch every night.
Would you call yourself a
Republican?
No.
Do you read The Michigan
Daily?
Yes.
Do you read The New York
Times?
Yes. I read it on my iPhone. Both
of them.
What's your favorite game on
your iPhone?
a just play Solitaire a lot. I have
Angry Birds, but I'm not that
great at it so...
Don't you think you should
practice? There is a big Angry
Birds tournament coming up.
Really?
No.
oh.
If there were, would you try
and practice?
No, I'm not good enough for it.
You could practice. You can
stop going to class for a week.
I don't have any class anyway.
You don't have any class?
Two classes.
How many credit hours is that?
Five.
Isn't that still a lot, isn't that
five hours of class?
Yeah.
So, I mean you could skip those
five hours of class and play
Angry Birds instead.

I could play in class.
So why don't you start doing
that?
Uh, I don't want to.
Can I come to your class and
coach you?
Sure.
Faygo or Big K?
I don't know what either or those
are. Oh the drink?
Yes.
I only know what Faygo is. I've
never heard of Big K.
It's the K-Mart brand soda.
Oh.
It's the really cheap ones the
RA buys you when you're in the
dorms.
Oh my RA sucked. We never got
anything.
Can you describe yourself
without using the letter S?
Caring. I thought you just meant
one word.
Well multiple words is fine.
I don't know. Um, thoughtful,
caring.
Do you want to make a com-
plete sentence?
No, not without the letter.
What is the best place on cam-
pus to bump uglies?
To bump uglies?
You know bump, grind, get
naked and do the horizontal
mambo?
Um, Skeeps?
Jillian is an Engineering senior
