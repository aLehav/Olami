Michael Cox, Ann Arbor’s 
new chief of police, was officially 
sworn in on Tuesday afternoon. 
The ceremony took place. in 
the 
City 
Council 
chambers 
and the audience consisted of 
several citizens, police officials, 
government officials and Cox’s 
close family and friends.
At the start of the ceremony, 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 
welcomed the crowd and shared 
opening remarks. He began his 
speech by addressing the goals 
of the Ann Arbor municipal 
department in general.
“It is at this time in this political 
environment, and this social 
and cultural environment, that 
policing receives an incredible 
amount of scrutiny,” Taylor said. 
“That scrutiny is appropriate … 
 
because of the intimacy and force 
of this service (and) because of 
the need of the service … We in 

the municipal organization are 
delighted to tell people more 
about what we’re doing and why 
we’re doing it, because we have 
a department that is professional 
and disciplined and staffed by 
people who come to work every 
day to do their best to provide 
law enforcement safety services 
without bias or favor.”
After 
explaining 
the 
overarching goals of the Ann 
Arbor 
municipal 
department, 
Taylor expressed his enthusiasm 
for Cox’s new role.
“I am particularly delighted 
that we have Chief Cox coming 
and joining us,” Taylor said. “I 
know and am confident that 
policing in Ann Arbor is in good 
hands when Chief Cox comes on 
board.”
Taylor then invited Assistant 
City Administrator John Fournier 
to the podium. Fournier mirrored 
many of Taylor’s sentiments and 
spoke highly of Cox’s work ethic 
and character.

Ben Gerstein, Central Student 
Government 
president 
and 
Public Policy junior, addressed 
the Assembly Tuesday in his 
Fall 2019 State of Students 
Address. Gerstein highlighted 
his administration’s focus on 
increasing 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological Services support 
throughout campus, as well as 

expanding wellness resources 
for students on North Campus.
In 
the 
address, 
Gerstein 
described how he and CSG Vice 
President Isabelle Blanchard, 
LSA senior, have created two 
new executive positions thus 
far. The new roles include 
Director of Outreach, which will 
serve as a facilitator between 
CSG 
and 
student 
groups, 
as well as the Government 
Relations Coordinator. The role 
of the Government Relations 

Coordinator 
is 
intended 
to 
ensure student voices are heard 
on the local, state and federal 
level. 
The 
Assembly 
approved 
LSA junior Evelyn Winter as 
the Director of Outreach in 
today’s meeting but has yet to 
fill the position for Government 
Relations 
Coordinator. 
According to Gerstein, this 
position is crucial, as it bridges 
the policy gap between students 
at the University and state and 

national government.
In 
their 
administration, 
Gerstein 
and 
Blanchard 
have chosen to focus on nine 
issue areas: accessibility and 
affordability, academic affairs, 
sustainability, diversity, equity, 
inclusion, sexual misconduct 
prevention 
and 
awareness, 
survivor empowerment, student 
health and wellness, student 
support/resources and internal 
CSG improvements.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The 
Institute 
for 
the 
Humanities 
hosted 
“The 
Power of Pronouns” as part 
of their High Stakes Culture 
series 
Tuesday 
evening. 
Panelists spoke about the 
linguistics behind gendered 
pronouns 
and 
what 
language may be used in 
the future. However, some 
students in attendance took 
issue with the framing of 
the discussion and felt the 

academic 
language 
used 
shrouded more important 
human 
elements 
of 
the 
subject, 
with 
the 
event 
failing 
to 
disclose 
why 
pronouns were so important 
in the first place. 
According 
to 
Kristin 
Hass, faculty coordinator 
of 
the 
Humanities 
Collaboratory, 
the 
event 
was intended to discuss 
linguistic 
and 
historical 
research of pronouns. 
“We 
were 
asked 
by 
undergraduates 
for 

a 
conversation 
about 
pronouns that turned on 
research of faculty who are 
interested in the linguistic 
and the historical nature 
of 
pronouns 
that, 
kind 
of, bring us to where we 
are in this moment on the 
question of pronouns, and 
how they get used, and why 
they are high stakes to all of 
us,” Hass said. 
Panelists 
American 
culture 
professor 
Scott 
Larson, 
who 
identifies 
as a trans person, and 

linguistics professor Robin 
Queen, who identifies as 
a cis person — or someone 
who identifies with the 
gender they were assigned 
at birth — and a lesbian, 
talked about the history 
of pronouns in the United 
States, 
the 
evolution 
of 
language, the linguistics 
behind 
gender 
neutral 
pronouns and how future 
generations might approach 
pronouns. 

As of Tuesday, all of Michigan’s 
House Democrats have supported 
calls for an impeachment inquiry 
for President Donald Trump.
Michigan U.S. Reps. Haley 
Stevens, Elissa Slotkin and Debbie 
Dingell 
joined 
the 
growing 
contingent of House Democrats 
calling 
for 
the 
President’s 
impeachment Tuesday.
In a statement, Stevens, who 
was the last of the seven to 
announce her support, said an 
investigation into the president is 
important for national security.
“I urge both the Judiciary 
Committee 
and 
Intelligence 
Committee to act quickly to 
independently investigate these 
matters as part of ongoing 
efforts to investigate numerous 
unethical and potentially illegal 
acts by the president and his 
administration,” the statement 
read. “I do not make this request 
lightly but rather out of a sober 
obligation to stand up for the rule 
of law and our national security.”
Dingell 
announced 
her 
stance Monday evening, citing 
similar reasons and adding 
a moral responsibility to the 
decision in a statement released 
Tuesday.

Over 70 students and faculty 
attended a Tuesday afternoon 
lecture 
by 
Swarthmore 
economics professor Amanda 
Bayer on the implementation of 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
in 
the 
field 
of 
economics. 
The event was hosted by the 
Department 
of 
Economics 
and 
co-sponsored 
by 
LSA’s 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
department.
Bayer 
has 
served 
on 
the 
American 
Economic 
Association’s 
Committee 
on 
the Status of Minority Groups 
in the Economics Profession. 
She published multiple studies 
on diversity and inclusion and 
serves as a visiting senior adviser 
at the Federal Reserve Board. 
Bayer 
discussed 
several 
studies on regression analysis 

which portrayed the inequality 
of gender and race in the 
field of economics. She found 
women are more likely than 
men to be denied tenure; all 
else equal, economics has the 
largest gender gaps amongst all 
math-intensive fields; and when 
women co-author with men they 
frequently get less credit than 
men for the same work. 
“I find the evidence pretty 
convincing that the playing field 
is not level,” Bayer said. “I find 
the evidence pretty convincing 
that any woman or minority 
economist in the room has 
faced heavy headwinds, and has 
really been superlative to get 
where they are today. It’s all the 
little things that matter. There 
isn’t just one fix to diversity 
and inclusion, but there are 
many different functions in 
the profession that need to be 
attended to.”

Bayer discussed the origins 
of bias and explained how many 
implicit 
assumptions 
dictate 
behavior. She described the 
ideas of Daniel Kahneman, 2002 
Nobel Memorial Prize laureate 
in 
economic 
sciences, 
who 
delineated “system one” biases, 
those 
which 
are 
cognitive 
and 
based 
on 
unconscious 
associations, 
versus 
“system 
two,” which includes conscious 
reasoning. System one biases, 
according to Bayer, are the main 
perpetrators of stereotypes.
“We 
think 
we’re 
being 
explicit, intentional and rational, 
but there’s always this influence, 
or threat,” Bayer explained. 
“These dynamics happen in all 
the professions, so there’s plenty 
of evidence of discrimination or 
bias amongst STEM scientists 
and others, but collectively as 
a field we seem to have a more 
severe problem.”
Bayer 
proposed 
three 
general 
approaches 
to 
improve 
diversity 
and 
inclusion: 
increased 
awareness 
and 
understanding, questioning 
assumptions 
and 
internalized 
biases 
and 
department-wide 
efforts 
of 
countering 
bias 
and 
exclusion. She described a 
study she co-authored in 
which emails encouraging 
students 
to 
enroll 
in 
economics courses across 
nine 
colleges 
and 
2,710 
students 
showcased 
the 
diversity 
of 
research 
increased the likelihood of 
completing an economics 
course by three percentage 
points.
“Once 
students 
understand what economics 
is, once they fill information 
gaps or correct stereotypes 
about the field, did they like 
the field? The answer seems 
to be ‘yes,’” Bayer said.
Bayer 
emphasized 
the 
importance for economists 
and students to use the AEA 
as a resource, following 

a robust initiative to uphold 
diversity and inclusion efforts. 
These initiatives were created 
directly 
after 
AEA’s 
2019 
survey results measuring the 
professional climate in the field 
of economics. The AEA released 
a statement on the issue which 
included in-progress resources 
and initiatives.
“Although a full analysis of 
the survey results remains to 
be done, it is evident from the 
findings released today that 
many members of the profession 
have suffered harassment and 
discrimination 
during 
their 
careers, including both overt 
acts of abuse and more subtle 
forms 
of 
marginalization,” 
the statement said. “This is 
unacceptable.” 
Business predoctoral research 
fellow, Jaclyn Schess, described 
the importance of the survey for 
her academic career, as she was 
gauging the environment for 
women in particular.
“I’m 
still 
thinking 
about 
getting a Ph.D. in economics, so 
this was really important to me 
to get a sense of what the current 
state of thought is on diversity 
and inclusion in the economics 
field, particularly because that 
applies to me,” Schess said. “I’ve 
definitely experienced a lot of 
hostility in my undergraduate 
degree, and I think I really 
wanted to get a sense of whether 
or not the field was moving in a 
good direction, as I’m making 
the decision of whether or not to 
apply to Ph.D.s.”
Rackham student Max Gross 
is currently pursuing a Ph.D. 
in economics, and expressed 
the need for more lectures and 
events to confront issues of 
diversity and inclusion. 
“The econ profession — and 
our department is no different 
— has big problems around 
diversity and inclusion,” Gross 
said. “I was happy to see the 
department 
invite 
Professor 
Bayer to confront some of those 
issues, and I hope that this is not 
the end of that confrontation.”

Day celebrates bisexuality, seeks to dispel myths 

September 24, 1999

Wearing 
a 
T-shirt 
emblazoned with “Bi Pride” 
in large red letters Ann 
Arbor resident Susan Hope, 
along with lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender 
community 
members, 
gathered last night at the 
Aut Bar for the inaugural 
Celebrate Bisexuality Day.
Celebrate 
Bisexuality 
Day, 
recognized 
worldwide, was initiated to 
acknowledge and celebrate 
bisexuality 
and 
bisexual 
history in society.
About 
45 
people, 

including 
students, 
supporters and Ann Arbor 
residents, with an equal 
gender ratio participated 
in the friendly atmosphere 
inside the bar and at outside 
tables.
“We’re here to socialize, 
have 
fun 
and 
drink 
together,” 
said 
Holly 
Ferrise, 
coordinator 
of 
education and training for 
the Office of Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual and Transgender 
Affairs.
The celebratory day is 
“the brainchild of three 
activists who wanted to 
challenge 
the 
pervasive 

and wrongheaded notion 
that any one of us can be 
defined by the gender of 
our 
partner,” 
according 
to information on BiNet 
USA, the largest Aerican 
Bisexual 
organization. 
BiNet USA works to develop 
visibility for the bisexual 
community.
Hope 
said 
she 
was 
pleased with turnout for 
the event and stressed the 
importance of visibility.
Many 
bisexuals 
define 
their 
sexuality 
on 
an 
individual basis, Hope said, 
but a general definition 
is 
“to 
be 
attracted 

emotionally, 
sexually, 
or 
romantically to members of 
all genders.
Many people believe that 
bisexuals 
are 
confused 
about their sexuality and 
the education - including 
pamphlets 
at 
the 
bar’s 
entrance - help to dispel 
this myth, Hope said. 
“It’s like a big bisexual 
potluck.” 
Hope 
said, 
gesturing 
to 
the 
people 
of 
varying 
ages 
and 
representing both genders 
mingling at tables. 
“Does biphobia make you 
blue?” Hope asked while 
wearing a necklace of four 

rainbow colored rings, that 
she said represented queer 
pride. Hope and others put 
blue paint on their faces 
to 
symbolize 
the 
fight 
bisexula phobia for people 
afraid to talk about their 
bisexuality.
Second-year 
graduate 
student 
Binyamin 
Biber 
said the celebration also 
gave significance to the 
“BT” in LGBT. The letters 
representing 
bisexuals 
and transgenders are often 
overlooked, he said.
Co-owner of the Common 
Language Bookstore Lyn 
Kelly sold books and pins 

related to bisexual topics 
last night.
“It’s really important to 
be supportive of people who 
stand up for themselves,” 
Kelly 
said. 
“People 
shouldn’t have to feel bad 
about themselves.”
Kelly laid her hand, with 
her arm dabbed with blue 
paint, onto book-covered 
table. She said that she 
didn’t expect her books 
to sell and that she was 
there predominantly as a 
supporter. ‘This much stuff 
has been written by and for 
(bisexuals). It’s an indicator 
of things changing.”

“For those of us who have 
worked with Chief Cox in, 
so far, nearly two months 
on the job, it is evident 
that we have welcomed a 
person of integrity, great 
vision 
and 
tremendous 
leadership abilities to our 
team,” Fournier said. “He 
is a forward-thinking and 
creative 
problem 
solver, 
and has dived head-first 
into the job, with all of the 
joys and complications the 
position may bring.”
After 
Fournier 
and 
Taylor 
spoke, 
Cox 
was 
welcomed to the front of 
the room and officially 
presented with his badge. 
Cox then took his oath of 
office, led by City Clerk 
Jackie Beaudry.
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
ceremony, 
Chief 
Cox 
addressed the crowd to 

share some of his personal 
goals moving forward.
“I 
believe 
the 
(Ann 
Arbor) Police Department 
is already very good, but 
going forward, we’re going 
to start to do things a little 
differently,” 
Cox 
said. 
“You will be able to see 
men and women out there, 
hopefully, talking amongst 
you … (and) being part of the 
community in a different 
capacity 
than 
just, 
you 
know, 
arresting 
people. 
Arresting people is part of 
the job; however, being a 
part of the community is a 
bigger part of the job.” 
He concluded his speech 
by encouraging Ann Arbor 
citizens to reach out to the 
police department to keep 
an open dialogue.
“Hopefully, you’ll talk 
to us and tell us what you 
expect, 
what 
you 
want 
from us, what you need, 
what you don’t want from 
us, so we can adjust our 

practices, 
tactics 
and 
policies to reflect what the 
community here desires,” 
Cox said. 
Many 
of 
the 
people 
attending 
the 
ceremony 
expressed their support for 
Cox’s intention to bridge 
any existing gaps between 
the Ann Arbor police force 
and the city’s community. 
Lieutenant 
Renee 
Bush 
volunteered 
her 
own 
encouragement on behalf 
of the department.
“We are very excited to 
have Chief Michael Cox 
here,” Bush said. “He came 
from Boston, and he brings 
a lot of experience, and 
knowledge, and skills and 
abilities to the city of Ann 
Arbor. We are especially 
excited about moving the 
department forward with 
some new things for our 
community, and to become 
closer with our community 
partners.”

Stabenow 
announced her support for 
impeachment in July. In a 
statement, Peters echoed 
concerns 
for 
national 
security, 
while 
still 
maintaining his stance.
“Given 
the 
deeply 
troubling 
allegations 
before 
us, 
the 
administration must turn 
over 
the 
whistleblower 
complaint to Congress so 
we can evaluate the facts,” 

the 
statement 
reads. 
“As a former Lieutenant 
Commander in the U.S. 
Navy Reserve and now 
serving on Senate Armed 
Services 
Committee, 
I 
know 
there’s 
nothing 
more 
important 
than 
protecting 
our 
national 
security. I support the 
House taking actions that 
they deem necessary to get 
the facts and meet their 
constitutional 
oversight 
responsibility.”
The increasing calls for 
impeachment comes after 
Trump has acknowledged 
withholding 
aid 
to 
Ukraine, with allegations 
surfacing it was a move 
to 
investigate 
former 
Vice President Joe Biden. 
House 
Speaker 
Nancy 
Pelosi 
announced 
on 
Tuesday that the House of 
Representatives will begin 
formal 
impeachment 
proceedings.
Camille 
Mancuso, 
communications chair of 
the University’s chapter 
of College Democrats and 
Public Policy junior, said 
the student organization 

supports 
of 
the 
seven 
House 
Democrats 
who 
have come out in favor of 
impeachment. 
“We stand with Nancy 
Pelosi and our Michigan 
Delegation 
— 
including 
Elissa 
Slokin, 
Debie 
Dingell, Andy Levin, Haley 
Stevens, 
Rashida 
Tlaib 
and Dan Kildee — calling 
for 
an 
impeachment 
inquiry,” Mancuso wrote 
in an email to The Daily. 
“The president must be 
held 
accountable 
for 
his actions. The job of 
Congress is to hold the 
president 
accountable 
for his unlawful actions 
and 
vote 
in 
the 
best 
interest of the American 
people. 
Congress 
needs 
to 
move 
forward 
with 
an 
investigation 
into 
these crimes and protect 
the laws that we are all 
expected to follow.”
The Daily reached out to 
the University’s chapter 
of 
College 
Republicans, 
but the organization did 
not respond in time for 
publication.

IMPEACH

“Part of what makes 
it hard is that pronouns 
aren’t like other nouns,” 
Queen 
said. 
“Pronouns 
are of a particular class of 
word that’s what’s called 
‘closed.’ You can’t 
just add to it. We 
can add all day 
long to nouns and 
verbs, we can have 
new 
verbs 
and 
new nouns and we 
do it all the time. 
But that’s because 
those 
types 
of 
words 
are 
open, 
they’re in an open 
class. 
But 
what 
we’re seeing is that 
you 
can 
change 
(pronouns). 
And 
that’s 
happening 
right now.”
After 
the 
panelists 
spoke, 
Associate 
Dean 
Angela 
Dillard 
invited 
audience 
members, 
consisting of around 40 
students, 
faculty 
and 
staff, to ask questions or 
raise comments. That’s 
when LSA junior Jordan 
Furr, who identifies as 
a trans person, stood in 
front of the room and 
voiced his concerns. 
“The title is ‘The Power 
of 
the 
Pronoun,’ 
and 
I 
think 
it’s 
ridiculous 
that we got into so much 
stress about grammatical 
issues, when the power 
of the pronoun should be 
about how powerful it 
is, how much pronouns 
used matter when you 
use 
them 
for 
people, 
and 
how 
misgendering 
someone can be very, very 
harmful,” Furr said.

His comment earned a 
few snaps and claps from 
the audience. After the 
event, Queen responded 
to 
Furr’s 
comment, 
saying 
her 
intent 
was 
not to ignore the human 
consequences of pronoun 
usage.
“I’m sort of a nerdy, 
language geek, and I think 

it’s really fascinating to 
see how this works within 
the grammatical system,” 
Queen 
said. 
“Perhaps 
it 
was 
misguided 
on 
my part not to be more 
specific about the ways in 
which that has political 
consequences for all kinds 
of people … I apologize 
for 
that, 
because 
that 
was not at all my intent, 
and it is also not what 
I believe personally or 
academically.”
“Furr said he believes 
trans 
issues, 
such 
as 
pronoun 
usage, 
should 
be represented by trans-
identifying 
individuals 
who 
are 
personally 
affected. 
While 
one 
speaker at the event did 

identify as trans, no one 
on the panel used “they/
them” pronouns. 
“I also would just like 
to say I think that if 
you’re going to have a sort 
of debate on they/them 
pronouns, it’s ridiculous 
to not have someone who 
uses they/them pronouns 
to speak about why they 
use them and how 
they 
feel 
about 
that,” Furr said. 
“You 
tokenize 
Scott as a trans 
person 
to 
give 
the 
rest 
of 
you 
credibility. But at 
the end of the day, 
only trans people 
should be talking 
about 
this. 
And 
yes, 
whatever, 
linguistics, 
academia, 
but 
overall 
I 
think 
that the University 
of 
Michigan 

that claims to be 
liberal could do a 
lot better.”
However, 
both 
Furr 
and 
LSA 
senior 
Katrina 
Stalcup, who identifies as 
cisgender, believe Queen 
was 
symptomatic 
of 
a 
system that privileges cis 
identity and perspective.
“It’s not about just one 
individual person doing 
something 
transphobic, 
it’s 
about 
cis 
people 
getting away with doing 
that,” 
Stalcup 
said. 
“Everything she did isn’t 
uniquely something that 
only 
she 
does. 
That’s 
quantified 
by 
all 
the 
questions 
that 
came 
afterwards where a cis 
man 
reiterated 
what 
Jordan said, and just 
completely 
invalidated 
the thing that he had 
said.”

PRONOUN

Chludzinski 
explained 
they decided to sue the city 
as a preventative measure, 
to protect their consulting 
firm from the threat of 
legal action on the part of 
the city. 
“Every American should 
be free to choose which 
political beliefs they will 
promote,” 
Chludzinski 
said. “So, instead of waiting 
to be punished, we decided 
to take a stand for freedom 
for ourselves and others — 
even those whose political 
views we oppose.” 
In 
response 
to 
the 
lawsuit, 
the 
city 
ruled 
that 
ThinkRight 
be 
categorized as a special 
interest consulting group, 
exempting 
it 
from 
the 
public 
accommodations 
law. As a result, the court 
dismissed the case. 
Chludzinski 
expressed 
appreciation for the city’s 
decision, citing it allowed 
him 
and 
his 
business 
partner the freedom to 
tailor their firm in the way 
they saw fit.
“Grant 
and 
I 
are 
selective about the causes 
and 
messages 
we 
will 
promote 
through 
our 
services,” 
Chludzinski 
said. “That means that we 
are now free to promote 
our 
conservative 
beliefs 
without the government 
forcing us to also promote 
political 
beliefs 
we 
oppose.”

In the lawsuit, it was 
established 
ThinkRight 
“cannot accept a project 
that 
requires 
it 
to 
promote messages, causes 
or 
political 
platforms 
that violate its faith or 
contradict its conservative 
political beliefs.” 
City Attorney Stephen 
Postema represented the 
city of Ann Arbor on the 
case. In an interview with 
The Daily, he explained 
ThinkRight’s 
case 
was 
unnecessary, as the city had 
never argued they would 
be 
forced 
to 
represent 
individuals holding views 
in opposition to them. 
“The city never believed 
that the ordinance would 
apply to the plaintiffs or 
that they were in violation 
of the ordinance,” Postema 
said. “There was not any 
city 
enforcement 
action 
against them or even any 
threatened 
enforcement 
against 
them. 
In 
fact, 
the city had never heard 
about 
the 
plaintiffs’ 
claims until the city was 
served with a lawsuit … 
In the end, there was no 
actual 
legal 
controversy 
to burden the court with. 
So, the plaintiffs correctly 
dismissed their case.”
Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 
Christopher Taylor echoed 
Postema’s 
assertion, 
explaining 
city 
officials 
were caught off guard by 
the lawsuit being filed in 
the first place. Taylor said 
neither he nor Postema had 
received any contact from 
ThinkRight 
Strategies 

before 
the 
consulting 
group took legal action.
“There 
was 
no 
interaction prior to the 
lawsuit,” 
Taylor 
said. 
“There was absolutely no 
enforcement action against 
them. There was, as far as 
I know, no knowledge of 
their existence prior to the 
lawsuit. No cease and desist 
letter, no communication 
threatening one thing or 
another.”
According to the website 
of the Alliance Defending 
Freedom, 
a 
Christian 
conservative group which 
funded ThinkRight’s case, 
the lawsuit was filed in 
response to Ann Arbor’s 
city ordinance. However, 
after the lawsuit was filed, 
there was little, if any, legal 
pushback by the city based 
on the non-discrimination 
ordinance, Taylor said. 
“There was never any 
threat 
of 
enforcement 
against the group,” he told 
The Daily.
Taylor also referenced 
the 57-page lawsuit itself, 
which includes extensive 
background 
on 
the 
origins of both Strobl and 
Chludzinski’s conservative 
beliefs, as well as on their 
creation 
of 
ThinkRight 
itself.
“If 
you 
read 
the 
complaint, 
it 
sounds 
a 
lot more like somebody’s 
‘About Us’ page on the 
website than a complaint 
actually seeking remedy 
against 
actual 
harm,” 
Taylor said.

EXEMPTION
From Page 1A

“I also would just like 
to say I think that if 
you’re going to have a 
sort of debate on they/
them pronouns, it’s 
ridiculous to not have 
someone who uses they/
them pronouns to speak 
about why they use 
them and how they feel 
about that.”

“Those are main issue areas 
that we thought we could 
effectively categorize certain 
issues on campus into, and 
they’re pretty straight forward 
but also holistic in the issues 
that they cover,” Gerstein said. 
“But also, the work that we’re 
going to be doing is not just 
limited to those areas. So, as 
matters arise and students voice 
specific concerns, just because 
they might not fall in one of our 
categories, that doesn’t mean 
we’re not going to address them.”
One of the projects the 
administration 
has 
worked 
to implement with regard to 
affordability is the installation 
of microwaves across campus 
in non-residential areas such 
as the Michigan League, the 
new Michigan Union and the 
Shapiro Undergraduate Library. 
According 
to 
Gerstein, 
in 
collaboration with University 
Unions and University Library, 
CSG has been working to 
implement these microwaves 
as soon as possible and develop 
a map of where the microwaves 
will be installed. 
“The microwaves are not yet 
up and running, but we know 
that it’s a small, minute change 
and by no means does that 
address food insecurity, which 
is a much larger, epidemic-like 
issue on campus,” Gerstein said. 
“But we receive email inquiries 
from students asking about 
microwaves a bunch … so the 

addition of those in commonly 
used spaces like the League 
and the new Union will help 
accommodate a lot of students.” 
In his address, Gerstein also 
discussed the lack of CAPS 
resources on campus. According 
to Gerstein, in just the first 
month of this school year, CAPS 
has already seen 20 percent of 
the total number of students it 
saw in the entirety of last year. 
As a result, CSG is looking at 
different ways it can increase 
funding so the University can 
hire more CAPS counselors 
across campus.
“There 
is 
a 
continuous 
increase in demand for students 
seeking counseling and mental 
health 
resources,” 
Gerstein 
said. “With the new union, 
with increased space for CAPS 
and with more of a demand for 
the services, I think we can at 
least do our part to add more 
counselors and take away less of 
the burden.”
The lack of wellness resources 
are 
especially 
prevalent 
on 
North Campus, where students 
have to commute in order to visit 
the University Health Center or 
the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center. 
His administration therefore 
hopes 
to 
create 
locations 
on North for these wellness 
resources. They also would like 
to ensure students on North are 
directly playing a role in terms 
of how these decisions are made. 
“North 
Campus 
is 
very 
resource-deficient in terms of 
the University in that students 
on North Campus who can’t 
find access into the embedded 

counselor model, or need other 
wellness resources like SAPAC 
or UHS, are forced to go to 
central campus,” Gerstein said. 
“When buses are crowded, when 
buses are running limited routes 
on weekends and when it’s bad 
weather, there are large barriers 
created for those students to 
have access to those resources.”
During 
the 
community 
concerns 
portion 
of 
the 
meeting, the Coalition to Defend 
Affirmative Action, Integration, 
and Immigrant Rights and Fight 
for Equality By Any Means 
Necessary (BAMN) addressed 
the Assembly. Michigan alum 
and BAMN organizer Kate 
Stenvig asked CSG to consider 
making 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan a sanctuary campus 
for 
immigrants, 
especially 
those who may be at risk of 
deportation.
“Something that CSG has 
taken a position on before is to 
make U-M a sanctuary campus 
for immigrants,” Stenvig said. 
“We think that right now, that is 
really the number one thing that 
the University can do to make 
clear that the University defends 
its immigrants and can take a 
stand against racism on this 
campus and improve campus 
climate.”
Considering 
the 
policies 
the University already has in 
place for immigrants, Selena 
Bazzi, LSA junior and CSG vice 
speaker, questioned Stenvig on 
the purpose of taking the next 
step in making the University a 
sanctuary.
“You said the University has 
some regulations that are set so 
that undocumented students are 
protected,” Bazzi said. “So, what 
would be the point of making the 
entire campus itself a sanctuary 
campus if the students are 
already protected?”
Stenvig 
responded 
by 
describing how the University 
plays an integral role in Ann 
Arbor, and if it becomes a 
sanctuary, 
then 
ideally 
the 
community 
will 
follow 
its 
footsteps 
with 
immigrant-
friendly policies.
“In terms of ICE, they have 
come to businesses around the 
area,” Stenvig said. “I think if 
the University itself, since it’s so 
much a part of what this whole 
community is, if they’re saying 
‘we’re a sanctuary campus,’ it 
really protects the community, 
and this community is so much 
more than just the students, so it 
would make a big example for so 
many other places.”
The Assembly also voted to 
approve the CSG budget for fall 
2019. Gerstein has one week to 
sign the budget, which would 
officially put it into effect.

A new perspective on back to school shopping
W

hat starts out as 
a 
typical 
back-to-
school ad becomes 
increasingly more and more 
disturbing as students in the 
background 
of 
each 
scene 
begin running away from some 
ominous threat. Each child who 
makes an appearance holds 
some sort of mundane object — 
a skateboard, colored pencils, 
socks — that is then utilized in a 
manner of self-defense. 
The dark shadow creeping on 
the heels of these kids is also one 
that is making its way across the 
country — polarizing politicians 
and constituents alike. This 
public service announcement 
recently published by the Sandy 
Hook Promise, a nonprofit aimed 
at 
preventing 
gun 
violence, 
prompts us to remember that we 
cannot neglect the issue of gun 
violence. The video conveys that 
shootings have become almost 
commonplace, to the extent 
where we should be aware 
and afraid they could happen 
anytime and anywhere. Though 
this may seem extreme, we have 
to accustom ourselves to the 
idea that it can become a reality 
for all of us. The message here is 
also a necessary call to action, 
because there really is no valid 
excuse as to why there has been 
no progress made on containing 
this threat. If we really want to 
see change occur, it is an effort 
that needs to be made on every 
level — from local to federal — 
and so far, we are failing to do 
so.
Gun violence has become an 
issue that is only growing more 
prominent, 
especially 
with 
the two attacks that happened 
within 24 hours of each other in 
August. Yet, the United States 
government has failed to make 
progress toward alleviating the 
problem, which is completely 
unacceptable. So far, one of the 
few politicians who has been 
vocal and transparent in their 

intentions to handle the issue 
is presidential candidate Beto 
O’Rourke. At the last Democratic 
debate, he shared his plans to 
take away AR-15s and AK-47s, 
which drew controversy. His 
plan has been seen as extreme, 
since he outright stated his 
intentions to limit the Second 
Amendment. At the same time, 
members of his own party 
are concerned that his words 
will hinder the progress of 
the gun control bill that has 
been proposed by Democrats. 
Congress has yet to pass the bill 
for background checks, which 
is currently still waiting on 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch 
McConnell for action. So far, 
there have been no Republican 
supporters of the bill, because 
they refuse to take action until 
they are sure President Donald 
Trump will support it.
This is not how Congress 
should work. The Republican 
excuse is just a cop out: If they 
actually cared about taking 
action, 
Trump’s 
potential 
response would not matter. 
Background checks are far less 
“extreme” in the sense that 
they do not completely prevent 
people from exercising their 
right to bear arms. Even if 
Trump threatens to veto the 
bill, Congress can always vote to 
override it — it is just a matter of 
whether or not they really care 
enough about it. At this point, 
gun 
violence 
has 
extended 
beyond the debate of exercising 
rights and become an issue of 
public health. Considering it 
has crossed into the domain of 
public health and safety, there 
is even less reason to not take 
action. The government has 
police powers — the ability to act 
in the interest of preserving the 
health and safety of the people — 
and it should exercise them. 
Being a politician is not about 
achieving what is easy, it is about 
achieving the greater good for 

your constituents — and the 
constituents want gun control. 
In a recently conducted Marist 
poll, 55 percent of adults 
agreed gun control was more 
important than their Second 
Amendment rights. Politicians 
are blatantly ignoring what 
the people actually want, but 
at what cost? Is campaign 
funding and support from the 
NRA really worth endangering 
the lives of so many Americans? 
When did politics become 
about staying in power for the 
sake of a career rather than 
helping the people? 
At the same time, Democrats 
should stand up and take a 
stronger stance. This is not an 
issue that can be compromised 
on. I know bipartisanship is 
necessary to get things done, 
but talks between the two 
parties 
will 
only 
continue 
to go in circles. If a bill on 
background checks — which 
is already such a simple form 
of gun regulation — cannot 
even get passed, what hope 
do we really have of achieving 
anything? If the government is 
at an impasse on the issue and 
there is no federal progress, 
then we need to seek out change 
through another method. Why 
give all of these politicians 
the privilege to affect change 
when they have done nothing 
with their power to help others? 
With 23 Republican Senate 
seats up for reelection in 2020, 
we can now be vocal in effecting 
change. If politicians seem like 
they are losing sight of what 
is important, we can easily 
remind them of what matters. 
The statistics show that a large 
percentage of us care strongly 
about regulation, we just need 
to make our voices heard. There 
is a saying that all politics is 
local. It all starts with us voters.

Trump’s trade war against China: the right thing to do

EVAN STERN | COLUMN

CHERYN HONG | COLUMN

All political opinions deserve a voice
A

s 
a 
first-generation 
immigrant, 
my 
family was never my 
source of political 
information. When 
my 
parents 
were 
finally allowed to 
vote, 
they 
simply 
taught 
me 
one 
thing: Always vote 
Democratic. I never 
questioned 
their 
advice, as I believe 
most teenagers do 
when 
they 
start 
learning 
about 
politics.
I 
blindly 
followed 
my 
parents’ beliefs up until high 
school. I lived in one of the 
wealthiest cities in Michigan 
and attended a prestigious 
private 
institution. 
My 
environment 
drastically 
changed, and I was surrounded 
by people from contrasting 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds, 
and — most strikingly — 
conservative political stances. 
At 
first 
glance, 
people 
may assume I struggled in 
a community of peers who 
come 
from 
conservative 
backgrounds and perspectives 
strikingly 
different 
from 
mine. 
However, 
to 
my 
surprise, I strongly gravitated 
towards people who thought 
differently than me. While 
I didn’t seek out people on 
the right side of the political 
spectrum, the students I got 
along with and enjoyed the 
company of happened to have 
views that strongly opposed 
my own. 
My first two weeks as a 
freshman at the University 
have been an overflow of 
information, 
from 
figuring 
out where to find lecture 
halls to how one can “Stay 
in the Blue.” But perhaps the 
biggest change I’ve noticed 
from my high school is how 
the University of Michigan 
community is fairly liberal, 
based on my experience of 
hallway talk and classroom 
discourse. 
In my first-year seminar, the 
Anthropology of Resentment, 
my professor assigned a New 
York Times column for us 
to observe how colleges are 
being criticized for being too 
liberal. Author Molly Worthen 
questioned how and if colleges 

are truly intellectually diverse. 
She refered to conservative 
watchdog groups who warned 
students of socialist 
professors 
and 
their 
prohibition 
of 
conservative 
expression. 
While 
these 
were 
hyperbolic 
claims, 
she strove to seek the 
source of the claims. 
Worthen 
proceeded to study 
whether professors 
successfully 
create intellectually diverse 
communities. My assignment 
led me to propose my own 
questions: Is the University 
creating an open environment 
for 
not 
only 
conservative 
views, but for all beliefs of 
the incoming freshmen and 
the entire student body? This 
poses another question: How 
does the University condemn 
hate and encourage an open 
space for all opinions at the 
same time? 

Having been surrounded 
by peers with beliefs that 
contradict my own throughout 
my 
secondary 
educational 
experience, I understand the 
value of being challenged, 
whether the topic is politics 
or any other issue. By the time 
of my high school graduation, 
I realized my closest friends 
came from the opposite side 
of the political spectrum. 
My personal growth in high 
school was thanks in part to 
my peers. However, while 
I got the most out of my 
high 
school 
experience, 
I 
understand that a high school 
community can be much more 
welcoming 
than 
a 
larger 
university. I wonder if certain 
conservative 
students 
who 
have different views from the 
majority liberal community 

feel at risk for being rejected 
or alienated. 
While 
it 
is 
refreshing 
and comforting to know 
that there are many people 
who share my beliefs, it is 
disheartening to know the 
atmosphere could also be 
hindering 
other 
students 
from speaking up. With the 
current 
political 
climate, 
it is more important than 
ever 
for 
individuals 
to 
understand 
perspectives 
other than their own. Like 
other students, I came to the 
University to be challenged. 
If we continue to create an 
atmosphere that reflects the 
same perspective and ideals, 
there 
is 
no 
opportunity 
for 
personal 
growth. 
A 
homogenous mindset stunts 
progression, and it would be 
a shame to waste a campus 
that is composed of minds 
that think differently and has 
students who are passionate 
about what they stand for. 
Even though I am an 
advocate for open spaces and 
allowing people to converse 
freely, it is imperative to 
note the need to prevent hate 
speech on campus. With the 
2020 presidential election 
coming up, it is easy for 
students to allow the tension, 
both inside and outside of 
political parties, to dissolve 
respect 
and 
courtesy 
for 
one another. Students have 
a key responsibility to know 
the 
difference 
between 
an intellectual debate and 
unnecessary 
conflict. 
The 
complexity of creating an 
open community shouldn’t 
deter us from attempting 
to balance an intellectually 
diverse conversation without 
malicious input. 
Rarely in our educational 
careers are we given a space 
where we can openly discuss 
contradicting 
opinions 
in 
a 
respectful 
manner, 
especially given the political 
climate. That said, I think 
everyone at the University 
should strive toward creating 
an 
environment 
where 
all opinions are welcome, 
especially the students.

tweeting 
“... 
trade wars are good, 
and 
easy 
to 
win” 
about a year and a half ago 
in reference to our nation’s 
growing 
trade 
tensions 
with China at that point, 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
was right about one thing. 
This trade war is clearly not 
as easy to “win” as he first 
claimed in March 2018, but, 
it is without a doubt the right 
course of action to take for all 
Americans. 
While 
Trump’s 
actions, 
which 
include 
imposing 
tariffs on billions of dollars 
worth of goods manufactured 
in China, may appear to many 
as provocative and dangerous, 
they 
are 
actually 
greatly 
warranted, as is evident from 
the bipartisan support his 
measures have received. For 
decades, China has engaged 
in significantly unfair trade 
practices against the United 
States, with our government 
doing little about it. 
As 
the 
current 
administration has correctly 
stated, China, the world’s 
largest 
exporter, 
has 
routinely 
been 
found 
to 
illegally and aggressively sell 
its products, manipulate its 
currency and steal America’s 
intellectual property, which 
are all part of a calculated 
effort to unethically elevate 
its economy above that of 
the U.S. As a result, everyday 
Americans playing by the 
rules have found themselves 
confined 
and 
limited 
by 
China’s 
previously-
unchallenged actions. 
In a 2018 White House fact sheet, 
it was reported that China has 
endangered millions of American 
jobs 
through 
a 
number 
of unfair tactics, including 
forced technology transfer, 
“outright cyber theft” and 
the imposition of tariffs on 
American 
goods 
that, 
on 
average, are triple (although 
sometimes 10 times greater) 
what the United States has 
imposed on Chinese goods. 
Furthermore, China has been 
found to regularly promote 
the dumping of its goods, 
conditions of over-capacity 
and the usage of industrial 

subsidies 
that 
“make 
it 
impossible for many United 
States firms to compete on a 
level playing field,” according 
to the fact sheet. Moreover, 
China accounts for 87 percent 
of 
the 
counterfeit 
goods 
that are confiscated upon 
reaching our borders. Finally, 
a number of plans the nation 
has developed — including the 
Made in China 2025 initiative 
— pose a direct economic 
threat to our nation and other 
law-abiding countries. 
Consider, as is detailed 
in a recent CNBC article, 
ordinary 
citizens 
trying 

to make a living as China 
moves to exploit them. With 
several different companies 
mentioned, 
it 
becomes 
strikingly clear that, despite 
the harm stemming from 
tariffs, Trump is answering 
a long call from many to 
attempt to put China in 
its place. “(I)t’s not a free 
market,” 
Neil 
Muyskens, 
CEO 
of 
the 
suffering 
Unicomp company, a small 
business that manufactures 
keyboards in Kentucky, said, 
“We are at a significant cost 
disadvantage 
and 
always 
have been.”
Many in this nation who 
are 
concerned 
about 
the 
impact of this trade war 
point 
to 
the 
decline 
of 
the stock market and the 
hardships felt by American 
consumers and businesses as 
evidence that our president 
is 
inadvertently 
harming 
this nation and throwing 
the 
worldwide 
economic 
landscape off balance. But 
while there are risks and 

rewards with any decision, 
the 
truth 
is 
confronting 
Beijing benefits the United 
States. 
Already, since the White 
House first began tackling 
China’s 
unfair 
trade 
advantage, 
we 
have 
seen 
progress. While the road to a 
deal has been bumpy at times, 
with work still necessary, 
Trump 
and 
Chinese 
President Xi Jinping have 
held negotiations in order to 
arrive at a solution that both 
sides can agree to. Most of 
all, by taking a stand against 
Beijing’s harmful practices, 
China is less likely to engage 
in these types of aggressive 
habits in the future as long 
as we keep applying this 
level of pressure on their 
government. 
Undoubtedly, Trump has 
encountered 
roadblocks. 
It is clear that such a great 
economic power like China, 
especially 
considering 
its behavior in the past, 
presents a unique challenge 
for the president and the 
U.S. And while many have 
been pessimistic about these 
efforts, 
our 
government 
doesn’t 
have 
much 
of 
an 
alternative 
choice. 
Ultimately, 
the 
United 
States can either continue 
to persevere as one of the 
world’s leading powers and 
triumph over these unethical 
conditions, or we can blink 
and allow China to further 
wreak havoc on our economy. 
As one considers the state 
of the current situation, it is 
fully clear that we have no 
choice but to continue this 
lengthy confrontation and 
eventually earn the respect 
we deserve from, not only 
China, but also from all other 
nations that trade unfairly 
with the United States. In the 
end, we will thank President 
Trump for ending years of 
direct, blatant assault on 
our economy and elevating 
the needs of hard-working 
Americans above all else.

Nell Zink’s “Doxology” offers a sweeping, multi-
generational story of an American family from the 
1980s to our current moment. It’s a deeply modern 
epic that whips through cultural touchstones like 
the ’90s punk scene, 9/11, late-’00s conservation 
movements and the 2016 election. “Doxology” is an 
ambitious novel, and though not every swing quite 
works, its lofty goals ultimately serve it well. 
We start with Pam, Daniel and Joe, three 
musicians living on the Lower East Side of 
Manhattan who are shocked by both a surprise 
hit single for Joe and an unplanned pregnancy 
for Pam and Daniel. Their scrappy beginnings are 
underpinned by a sense of genuine camaraderie, 
and the characters’ histories are laid out with 
sprawling, extensive detail. We follow them 
through the ’90s as they raise baby Flora and work 
on the music, through A&R meetings and concerts, 
all the way through to the events of Sept. 11, 2001. 

From there, the novel shifts focus to Flora, and 
we watch her as she grows up, goes to school, and 
gets involved in political campaigns, including, 
eventually, Jill Stein’s Green Party bid for the 2016 
nomination.
Zink is a sharp writer, the sort whose offhand 
observations sting with their acuity. Like when 
Flora’s post-grad entry level job starts dampening 
her spirit, Zink writes: “She faked the rote 
excitability of a charismatic zombie. She hid in 
the ladies’ room and cried.” She sweeps through 
days, weeks and years with unrelenting speed and 
dexterity, but it’s these moments of keen observation 
that cut through the grandeur and expanse of the 
novel’s concept. 
Trump looms large in “Doxology,” but less as an 
endpoint in a larger American narrative and more as 
a silent fixture, a structural keystone in the politics 
of an intimate family story. The modern political 
climate, Zink seems to argue, is deeply connected 
to the personal ties and erosions in contemporary 
America, but the personal will always take 
the foreground over the political in a person’s 
conceptions of their own lives. “The personal is not 

political,” she writes. “It can become political when 
abstracted and generalized, stripped of identifying 
markers. The political subject is a depersonalized 
subject: This could be you.” 
On its surface, there’s nothing depersonalized 
about “Doxology.” It’s as specific and clearly 
drawn a story as you can imagine. Approaching it 
as purely a work of political commentary would do 
a disservice to the intricate narrative structures 
within which Zink works. At the same time, 
though, there’s no ignoring the ways the family 
dynamics pay tribute and give service to a larger 
political narrative, as a send-up of our modern 
media diets and political strategies. The personal 
isn’t political, Zink argues, but the political might 
just be personal. It’ll be interesting to see how 
“Doxology” ages, how its specificity and distinctly 
contemporary cultural references take narrative 
form after their relevance wanes. But that’s a 
conversation for another day. With “Doxology,” 
Zink achieves a criticism that goes beyond satire to 
arrive at something suspiciously resembling hope. 
For the moment, at least, the novel feels much more 
than merely relevant. It’s essential.

‘Doxology’ is expansive, essential and very, very good

BOOK REVIEW

Oftentimes, when people think of house 
shows, DIY shows or any other sort of 
“show” with some other word leading it, they 
think of a damp, cold room accompanied by 
people awkwardly standing around as the 
sound of feedback screeches from a guitar 
amp off in the distance. These shows blend 
together, featuring band after band that 
usually encompasses a similar set of sonic 
characteristics and songwriting subjects, 
with members either strictly playing the 
drums, bass or guitar.
But why is that? The term ‘house show’ 
should simply imply some sort of show inside 
of a house, right? Why is the term associated 
with such a consistent, specific experience? 
Why does the term conjure up mental images 
of christmas lights strung up around moldy 
basements with people awkwardly bobbing 
their head to loud music that all sort of 
blends together for three hours?
This past Friday, I was invited by two 
close friends to attend a show they were 
putting on … inside of their house. One might 
even call it a house show. However, the show 
didn’t require me to walk down to a dimly 
lit basement or to stand around as my back 
slowly started to yell at the rest of my body for 
having such poor posture. When I arrived, I 
was greeted by a collection of smiling faces, 
quietly chatting in the living room, sitting 
in different chairs, couches and even on the 
carpeted floor. The space was exactly as the 
Facebook event had described — cozy.
The two artists each played sets of their 
own music. One played a collection of found 
sounds in order to create an immersive 

soundscape that turned what I thought was 
15 minutes into nearly 40. It wasn’t until 
she approached the piano that I started to 
come to. The next performer played some of 
his songs for the first time ever, prefancing 
his performance with a short blurb about 
how he had never shared some of these 
songs with more than one or two people at 
a time before diving into a song featuring 
a droning synthesizer, piano, cello, and of 
course, singing. These songs were much 
different from what you might typically 
hear from a coffee house singer/songwriter; 
I was mesmerized by the long and atypical 
structures found in these performances, 
wondering when I had last been so captivated 
at a house show.
So why do we think of bands playing 
different variations of rock music in a smelly 
basement as what a house show is? I don’t think 
there’s anything wrong with those types of 
shows; in fact, I’ve had great experiences at 
many of them, as most of my friends and even 
acquaintances probably know. However, I 
really think it’s important to expand the 
ideas of what a house or basement show can 
be, especially for people booking shows. But 
just as there is a difference between a house 
and a home, I believe there’s a difference 
between a house show and a show inside of 
a house. A sui generis performance like the 
one I experienced on Friday are events that 
could only achieve the intimacy and wonder 
that they do because of the setting and 
environment it creates.
House shows, to me, are more than 
anything 
else 
an 
intimate 
experience. 
Sharing music with your peers is something 
that’s really special, and I think that no 
matter what your music sounds like, it 
deserves to be heard. That’s what these 
house shows are for.

On turning a house into a
home ... or rather, a show

M83 rose to widespread prominence with the 
release of his sixth studio album Hurry Up, We’re 
Dreaming, which spawned the successful single 
“Midnight City,” a song that arguably represents 
the peak of the synthwave genre. Unfortunately, 
it’s been downhill ever since for Anthony 
Gonzalez, the man behind the M83 moniker. 
After the lukewarm reception received by his last 
studio album Junk, the decision to follow it up with 
DSVII, a collection of instrumentals, is probably 
not a smart commercial decision. However, if he 
intends to rehabilitate his image among critics and 
fans, it makes a lot of sense; an instrumental album 
is relatively pressure-free. 
DSVII is not the electropop M83 is known for — 
it is an instrumental progressive electronic album 
that, at times, borders on ambient. It sounds like 
the soundtrack to a video game from your youth 
that you rediscover years later. You start to play 
it out of a sense of nostalgic obligation, only to 
realize that it really hasn’t aged all that well. Let 
there be no mistake: DSVII is far from unpleasant, 
just hollow. The ambient wistfulness it intends to 
evoke falls flat. 
The tracks range from pleasant, yet largely 
uneventful, to interminable. There are a few songs 
worth mentioning — the project reaches its zenith 
with “Feelings,” a dynamic and creative piece that 
avoids many of the self-indulgent pitfalls the tracks 
surrounding it succumb to. “A Word Of Wisdom,” 
while a decent enough composition, sounds out 
of place on the project. It sounds less like a retro 
soundscape and more like the closing credit music 
to an educational children’s show that is about to 
be cancelled. “Jeux d’enfants” is a pretty piano 
piece, notable in its restraint and taste compared to 
many of the sprawling yet inconsequential tracks 

that surround it. “Oh Yes You’re There, Everyday” 
is the weakest piece on the album, spending far 
too long on an idea with far too little substance. 
“Temple of Sorrow” is an excellent closer, and one 
of the stronger efforts M83 has made since Hurry 
Up, We’re Dreaming. Despite some good selections, 
the vast majority of the songs on DSVII commit the 
cardinal sin of art: being utterly forgettable. 
Nostalgia is difficult to get right — for most, it 
becomes a crutch, a cheap trick through which 
one can evoke emotions without actually saying 
anything. By its nature, it is a dependent tool: 
Without the preformed emotional connections to 
whatever is being used as the object of nostalgia 
(in this case, cheap 80s synths), the expression 
becomes meaningless. While it can be a useful 
artistic ornament, triggering a sense of recognition 
by appealing to some aspect of collective memory, 
it cannot adequately substitute for creativity or 
interest. Unfortunately, M83 has for the better part 
of their career leaned on the nostalgia evoked by 
cheesy synths as a crutch (especially on their most 
recent project Junk). DSVII is no different.
If you want decent ’80s-tinged background 
music, or if you have a specific taste for video game 
soundtracks, then listen to DSVII. If not, you won’t 
lose much by skipping this one.

M83’s latest relies on a few
too many crutches to soar

“Britney Runs a Marathon” has almost all it 
needs to be a success. Sure, stories like this have 
been told before and stories like this will be told 
again. But the cast, led by Jillian Bell (“22 Jump 
Street”) as Britney, breathes life into the cookie-
cutter characters, melodramatic dialogue and 
stale, situational comedy set in New York. There’s 
certainly laughs to be had as Britney decides to 
change her life by running the New York Marathon. 
“Britney Runs a Marathon” works best when Bell 
and the cast embrace genre tropes like self-love and 
the value of friendship and just have fun with it. 
The problem with “Britney Runs a Marathon” isn’t 
its familiarity — the problem is its ambition.
The film attempts to tackle issues like body 
image, mental health, substance abuse and social 
media culture all at the same time. It does so in a 
serious way, without levity or satire. There is such 
an influx of topics, though, that any sort of depth 
is impossible; each is more like a plot device than 
meaningful content. Even Britney’s body image 
struggle, the driving force of the story, is half-

baked. Britney’s entire character arc depends on 
her desire to change her BMI. They had to get it 
right, yet the movie falls flat on its face. 
The story begins with a doctor telling Britney 
she should lose weight. Britney rejects this, saying 
that all body types are beautiful. This a valid point, 
but Britney discards it in the very next scene, when 
she has an unprompted breakdown and suddenly 
begins running. 
The editing tries to salvage things, supplying 
reasons for the epiphany. The film cuts to an 
unhappy Britney, drowning in snacks and alcohol. 
It appears Britney is both fighting being overweight 
and substance abuse issues simultaneously by 
going on a run. The plot backs this viewpoint up. 
As Britney sheds the pounds, her alcoholism simply 
disappears. No need for counseling or rehab. It’s 
just that easy.
Problematic implications aside, editing cannot 
be the only source of character motivation. Too 
much is left up to the viewer. It’s impossible to 
connect the dots as to why exactly Britney starts 
training for the marathon. 
Britney’s victories feel hollow because the 
stakes are unclear. Is she doing this to look 
better, feel better, or something else? Near the 
end, a character tells Britney “it was never about 

your body.” She seems to agree, but that idea was 
neither built up to or returned to over the course 
of the story. The film began with the doctor telling 
Britney to change her BMI, and she apparently 
listened: It’s clearly been about her body, from the 
start. Also, throughout the second act, Britney 
is almost entirely focused on a romance subplot, 
which clouds things even more. 
Britney’s characterization fractures further in 
the third act. To give the narrative some tension, 
Britney acts like a monster to friends, family, and 
strangers. The worst of it is her body shaming 
another woman at a dinner party, hurling lowbrow 
insults that wouldn’t be out of place in a middle 
school cafeteria. This almost destroys the film, 
alienating Britney for the most important stretch 
of the story and throwing any notion of nuanced 
social commentary out the window. When Britney 

suddenly turns back to normal, the change in 
personality is incorporated into her arc in a way 
that’s empty and detrimental to what the movie is 
trying to accomplish. 
In the end, Britney learns to be a healthier, more 
independent person, but not one who isn’t too 
‘cold’ to make friends. None of this is supported 
by the lopsided character development and lack 
of motivation. It all feels phony. The cluttered 
epiphany is never tied together, and is mostly 
ignored in the denouement in favor of the romance 
subplot. 
It’s a shame, because even as the plot unravels, 
there are some genuinely funny scenes and moments 
where the performances ring with authenticity. But 
it’s not enough to save the script. “Britney Runs a 
Marathon” could be enjoyed in passing, but most 
likely will not be remembered.

‘Britney Runs a Marathon’

State Theatre, GQT Quality 16, Ann Arbor 20+ IMAX

Amazon Studios

“The Masked Singer,” a reality show from South Korea 
(the country that seems to have perfected the form in 
recent years), is back on Wednesday for its second season. 
The premise is simple: Groups of celebrities perform 
anonymously in elaborate costumes while the judges 

and viewers try to guess their identity. Each week, two 
“face off” in a competition, and the loser is eliminated and 
de-anonymized, providing most of the show’s memorable 
moments. Beyond that, I really knew nothing else before 
watching the season two sneak peek, which recapped 
the first season and introduced new contestants, and 
I realized that I don’t really know how to judge reality 
TV at all. So, here are a couple questions I simply want 
answers to by the end of this season.
My first question is: Who is blackmailing Nick 

Cannon? To be honest, for the C-list celebrities, notable 
and formerly beloved Steelers wide receivers and Terry 
Bradshaws who make up most of the contestants, 
the entire deal seems like a good amount of fun. This 
includes Ken Jeong, who plays a supercharged clueless 
version of what I imagine my own dad would be like as 
a judge. But Nick Cannon looks like he’s struggling out 
there. It’s not that he’s not enthusiastic or charming like 
on “America’s Got Talent” or similar shows, but there’s 
a look of desperation and existential questioning that’s 
distracting.
My next question, a rather short one that I think 
I already have the answer to is: Is Robin Thicke, one 
of the regular judges, really a human being? I’m 99 
percent sure the answer is no, and this “sneak peek” 
hasn’t changed my mind one bit. While Nick Cannon’s 
dead eyes are a cry for help, Robin Thicke’s even 
deader eyes, flatter monotone, and general lack of any 

sort of genuinely appearing emotion are because he is 
an automaton. In any case, I’m looking forward to more 
evidence.
Perhaps the most important question is: Where the hell 
have I been? Apparently, this show was a really big deal? 
Noted anti-vaxxer Jenny McCarthy mentions that she 
has been told that broken family units have been brought 
together because of this show? Apparently, it was one of 
the highest rated shows on TV during the first season? As 
someone who considers himself mildly culturally aware, 
is such a perception complete nonsense? Is this entire 
thing just a fever dream? Is Nicole Scherzinger actually 
complimenting LaToya Jackson dressed up as an alien on 
her stage presence while Ken Jeong ponders whether she 
is Kate Moss or Paula Abdul? Or am I watching some sort

TV NOTEBOOK

The University of Michigan’s historic Symphony Band’s first 
performance of the year is set to take place on Sept. 27 in Hill 
Auditorium. The theme of the evening is “Almost Baroque.”
Jordan Smith is a first year special in flute performance, having 
previously completed a Masters degree at the University. After a 
ninth month hiatus from Symphony Band, Smith is thrilled to be 
stepping back on the Hill Auditorium stage. 
“My favorite part of being in Symphony Band is being immersed 
in music making at the highest level,” Smith said. “My colleagues 
are truly inspirations to me. Every instrumentalist in this ensemble 
is a professional.”
The band makeup ranges from grad students and specialists, 
like Smith, to a few talented underclassmen. Jason Frazier, a 
sophomore pursuing a Bachelor of Music degree in saxophone 
performance, is one of these underclassmen. This is his first term 
in Symphony Band, and he is thrilled at the opportunity to be a part 
of such a historic ensemble.
“I think our history sets us apart from other instrumental 
groups, and part of our history is being pioneers in the American 
band movement,” Frazier said. “Dr. Revelli, the original director 
of the symphony band, was very adamant about each instrument 
having its own professor dedicated to that instrument. That 
insistence made U-M the first university in the United States to 
have a professor that only taught saxophone and to offer a degree 
program in saxophone performance.”
As a young saxophone player, Frazier recognizes those who 
came before him who pushed for his instrument to be included in 
the band. 
“I think the most challenging thing for me so far has been 
having to fill in the really big shoes that this ensemble has. This 
is such a historic ensemble, and it was key in the establishment of 
the saxophone as a legitimate concert instrument,” Frazier said. “It 
really is an honor to be part of that history.”
Professor Michael Haithcock directors the University Symphony 

Band. As one of the top bands on campus, the group works hard to 
maintain a level of excellence. 
“The Symphony Band differs from most ensembles on campus 
because of trust. Professor Haithcock trusts us and expects us to 
be ready for each rehearsal coming in with questions or ‘hitting 
the save button’ on things we rehearsed one day and not having to 
repeat those same things,” Smith said. “This ensemble has a very 
long legacy of being one of the greatest ensembles at the collegiate 
level.”
“(Professor Haithcock) picked Igor Stravinsky’s Concerto for 
Piano as the ‘anchor piece’ for the concert, and then he built the 
theme around that. Since the Stravinsky is heavily influenced by 
J.S. Bach and Baroque forms, he thought to have the rest of the 
program be influenced by Baroque music to some extent,” Frazier 
said. The evening will consist of a wide variety of classical music, 
featuring pieces such as Ralph Vaughan Williams’s “Toccata 
Marziale,” Anne Clyne’s “Masquerad,” and David Maslanka’s 
“Traveler.” 
The concert will also feature a pre-concert talk at 7:15 p.m. in 
the lower lobby of Hill Auditorium with Dr. Liz Ames, the piano 
soloist for the Stravinsky Concerto, Professor Haithcock and 
Michael Daugherty, the composer of the last piece on the concert. 
The talk-back and concert are both free, ensuring no one has to go 
“baroque” to see it. With a dedicated group of students, a fantastic 
line-up and a legacy of excellence to back them up, every Symphony 
Band concert is history in the making.

Field hockey team forms its identity

What do you want this team’s 
identity to be?
Every coach from high school 
on up to professional leagues 
is faced with some form of this 
question at the beginning of every 
season. This year, Michigan field 
hockey coach Marcia Pankratz 
kept her answer very simple.
“Hard-working,” 
Pankratz 
explained. 
“Warriors. 
Hard-
working. Wolverines. Together. 
Playing together on and off the 
field. 
When 
Pankratz 
inevitably 
faces her team at the end of 
grueling practices, during half 
time of tight games and after 
emotional fourth quarters, both 
excruciating and exhilarating, 
those are the words that will form 
the cornerstones of her speeches. 
While certainly difficult to do, 
making that determination was 
only the first step to establishing 
the culture necessary to support 
a winning team. Words are 
meaningless 
if 
they 
aren’t 
accurate 
and 
messages 
ring 
equally hollow if they aren’t 
tested.
Building 
a 
culture 
takes 
adversity. It takes challenges and 
tests.

If the Wolverines were seeking 
a challenge, they had to look no 
further than the first five games 
of the season. Four of those 
matches came against ranked 
opponents, three of which were 
in the top ten: No. 10 Wake Forest, 
No. 3 Connecticut and No. 1 North 
Carolina. With No. 21 Stanford 
rounding out the quartet of top-
tier opponents, the Wolverines’ 
opening schedule was anything 
but easy.
But 
then 
again, it wasn’t 
supposed to be.
 
“It’s 
by 
design that we 
play 
a 
tough 
pre-conference 
schedule to play 
against the best,” 
Pankratz 
said. 
“To improve and 
see 
where 
we 
are.”
Warriors are built through 
battle. And battle is exactly what 
Michigan did.
After falling 4-0 to UNC in the 
season opener, the Wolverines 
bounced back with a decisive 3-0 
win against Wake Forest en route 
to a 3-2 record through the first 
five games, with two wins against 
top 25 opponents.
The Connecticut game, above 

the rest, stands out as a step 
forward. 
Michigan 
had 
not 
beaten the Huskies since 2005, 
but after jumping out to an early 
lead and staying strong enough 
to withstand a fourth quarter 
push, the Wolverines ended that 
14-year drought. 
“We’ve had a steady increase 
over the games,” said junior 
midfielder Kayla Reed. “We had 
a good win last week over UConn 
which 
was 
a 
good confidence 
booster for the 
girls.”
In anticipation 
of 
what 
Reed 
describes 
as 
a 
competitive 
Big 
Ten, 
Pankratz 
hopes 
that 
battle 
testing 
her 
team 
will 
pay 
dividends 
later. 
Running 
her team through the gauntlet 
was an intentional ploy to lay the 
foundation she sought.
A team cut from the cloth of 
those that grind out every game 
they play. A hard-working group 
that gives everything it has for 60 
minutes and never says die.
“And I think we are that,” 
Pankratz said. “So I’m proud of 
them.”

Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz intentionally scheduled difficult early season opponents, hoping to test her team.

Guided by Stratigakis goal, Michigan beats Ohio State in Columbus, 2-1

Sometimes, you just need to 
take a break. For the Michigan 
women’s soccer team, halftime 
provided just what was needed 
on Sunday, and the Wolverines 
came 
out 
of 
their 
break 
energized and aggressive. 
Despite being tied at one 
with Ohio State (3-5-1 overall, 
1-1-0 Big Ten) at the end of the 
first half, Michigan (7-2-0, 2-0-
0) was being outshot 14-7 and 
had allowed the Buckeyes to 
dominate possession.
The Wolverines looked like 
a different team after halftime, 
and junior midfielder Sarah 
Stratigakis’ slow-rolling shot 
four minutes into the half gave 
Michigan the 2-1 advantage 
it protected for the rest of the 
game. 
Early on, the Wolverines 
ceded 
possession 
to 
Ohio 
State, as they spent much of 
the match’s first 10 minutes 
hemmed in their own third of 
the field.
“I just think Ohio State came 
out with great energy and came 
at us really quick with some 
good pressure,” said Michigan 
coach Jennifer Klein. “It just 
took us a little bit of time to 
settle into the game and get into 
our game plan. I thought once 
we 
were 
able 
to possess the 
ball … it opened 
up some better 
opportunities 
for us.”
Both 
teams 
came 
out 
physical and the 
rivalry matchup 
only contributed 
to the intensity. 
There 
was 
no 
shortage of contact—19 fouls 
were committed between the 
two teams. The physical play 
continued 
throughout 
and 
contributed to both Wolverine 
goals, one coming on a penalty 
shot and the other off of a free 
kick. 
“I 
think 
(physicality) 
definitely goes into the rivalry 

and the tradition of the two 
teams competing,” Klein said. 
“And both teams coming off a 
win on Thursday, and getting 
an opportunity to get two 
wins on the week, kind of sets 
itself up for the teams to throw 
everything at each other.”
About halfway 
through 
the 
first half, a lack 
of 
possession 
cost 
Michigan. 
A strong Ohio 
State shot from 
just outside the 
penalty 
box 
was blocked by 
junior defender 
Alia 
Martin, 
who 
collapsed 
in pain as a result. As she tried 
to grab the ball out of the air, 
junior 
goalkeeper 
Hillary 
Beall collided with sophomore 
defender 
Janiece 
Joyner, 
allowing the ball to roll to open 
Buckeye Marissa Birzon. Birzon 
fired the ball into the back of 
the net as Beall scrambled to 
recover from being tangled up 
on the ground.
Ohio 
State’s 
one-goal 
advantage 
was 
short-lived, 
though, and junior midfielder 
Nicki 
Hernandez 
converted 
a penalty kick less than 30 
seconds later, tying the match 
at one in the 25th minute. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
quick 
answer 
to tie the game 
and 
strong 
performance 
in 
the 
final 
10 minutes of 
the 
first 
half 
provided 
some 
positivity 
heading 
into 
halftime. After 
the break, they wasted no 
time getting back to what was 
working.
“I felt we had a great 
response in the second half,” 
Klein said. “To get another goal 
early, it really helped us settle 
into the game a bit more.”
Stratigakis drew a foul when 
she was pulled down from 

behind bringing the ball into the 
Buckeye penalty box in the 49th 
minute. The ensuing free kick 
was taken by senior midfielder 
Brook Cilley and deflected in 
front of the goal by an Ohio 
State defender. A redirection 
by sophomore defender Sydney 
Shepherd 
sent 
the 
ball 
back 
to the feet of 
Stratigakis, 
who 
promptly 
secured a lead 
for Michigan.
For the rest 
of 
the 
match, 
the Wolverines’ 
defense 
was 
stout, preventing 
the 
Buckeyes 
from effectively centering the 
ball and stopping developing 
attacks with physical play. Ohio 
State’s lone dangerous scoring 
opportunity came with six-
and-a-half minutes left to play, 
when a Buckeye striker’s spin 
move on the left wing freed 
them to cross the ball into the 
box. Ohio State’s Kayla Fischer 
received the ball at point-
blank range directly in front 
of Michigan’s goal and made a 

last-gasp effort. She fell to the 
turf as she stretched for the 
ball and delivered a hard shot to 
a part of the goal left exposed 
by 
Beall. 
Luckily 
for 
the 
Wolverines, Hernandez’s shin 
was perfectly placed to prevent 

a late, game-tying score.
Michigan’s 
steady 
improvement over the course 
of the match was critical in 
securing the team’s second road 
win over a Big Ten opponent 
this week. 

“It’s a big rivalry game 
and when aggression meets 
aggression, 
talent 
shows,” 
Stratigakis said. “I feel like 
our team really showed that 
and that’s why it became a 2-1 
result.”

Wolverines sputter to ninth place 
finish at Inverness Intercollegiate

The Inverness Intercollegiate 
offered the Michigan men’s golf 
team a chance to start anew. 
With a strong performance, 
the Wolverines could put their 
second-to-last place finish at 
last week’s Windon Memorial 
Classic firmly in the rearview 
mirror, 
cementing 
their 
struggles as nothing more than 
a blip. 
After placing ninth out of 
15 teams in the two-day event 
this week, though, it’s clear 
that Michigan still has a ways 
to go before becoming a serious 
competitor. 
“Ultimately, ninth place is 
not where we intend to finish,” 
said Michigan coach Steve 
Barlow. “Although there were 
some positives that we can 
take from moving forward, we 
still had mistakes that ended 
up leading to big penalties and 
resulted in us not finishing 
where we wanted to overall.”
The 
Wolverines 
finished 
31-over-par, for a three-round 
team total of 883. Leading 
the way for Michigan was 
senior Brent Ito, whose 216 
54-hole total landed him in 
a tie for 11th place out of 90. 
The performance marked Ito’s 
second straight top-12 finish to 
begin the season. 
“Overall, I’m pretty satisfied, 
but definitely hungry to get 
better,” Ito said. 
He attributes his early season 
success to the three-month-
long rest period provided by 
the broken ankle he suffered 
last spring. After the rest, Ito 
came back rejuvenated and has 
been on a “pretty good stretch” 
ever since. 
“(Ito’s) pulled our end and 
has played really well,” Barlow 
said. “He had a good finish last 
week and followed that up this 
week with another good one. 

He’s been the leader of this 
team thus far, really put us on 
his back and carried us.”
But Ito’s personal success 
has 
yet 
to 
translate 
to 
accomplishments 
for 
the 
Wolverines as a collective unit. 
Although golf is often viewed 
as an individual sport, team 
golf challenges that notion. 
All 
players 
are relied on 
to 
pull 
their 
weight equally, 
as 
the 
four 
highest scores 
are 
pooled 
together in the 
end. 
Barlow 
recognizes that 
in this aspect 
— having a 
core group of strong players — 
Michigan isn’t quite there yet, 
although he feels it is getting 
close. 
“Some of the things we 
talked about last week that 
we needed to get better at, 
we did get better at,” Barlow 
said. “One thing was stopping 
the 
bleeding 
quicker. 
Last 
week it took entirely too long. 
You’re always gonna run into 
stretches, especially in team 
golf, where you struggle, but 
the best teams bounce back 

quickly. I thought we were 
better at that this week. The 
guys took that to heart and 
were cognizant of that leading 
up to this week.”
At 
the 
Inverness 
Intercollegiate, 
there 
were 
flashes of potential. Junior 
Henry Spring shot a 69 (-2) 
in his final round, which tied 
his career best. 
Sophomore Ben 
Dunne tied his 
career low with 
a 72 (+1) and 
finished 
in 
a 
tie for 35th. On 
his last round, 
junior 
Charlie 
Pilon shot a 72, 
finishing tied at 
46th. 
Promising 
results like these have Barlow 
believing that sustained success 
is right around the corner. 
“I think we’re close,” Barlow 
said. “Big numbers are fixable. 
The entire week, I said to my 
assistants that we’re close to 
breaking out. There’s a lot of 
talent on this team, all the way 
down the lineup… We’ll be a 
better team in the Spring than 
the Fall, and that’s because 
we’re going to continue to get 
better. I think per the breakout, 
it’s only a matter of time.”

When 
people 
spewed 
prognostications this offseason 
about 
Michigan’s 
new-look 
offense they generally centered 
around 
one 
foundational 
assumption: The offensive line 
was going to be a strength.
Four of five starters returned 
from a year ago. The fifth 
starting spot was a choice of 
luxury — between an athletic 
young talent in Jalen Mayfield 
and an experienced commodity 
in Andrew Stueber — rather than 
desperation. Michigan coach Ed 
Warriner was set to return for a 
second season. For the first time 
in years, the trenches would be 
of no concern.
At 
least 
that’s 
how 
the 
thinking went.
Amid the litany of issues 
plaguing the Michigan offense 
this 
year, 
the 
inexplicable 
struggles up front have not been 
lost on players and coaches.
“The offensive line, we talked 
about that being an experienced 
group,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh on Monday. “They’ve 
got to play good, they’ve got to 
hustle, protect the quarterback, 
they’ve got to play physical in 
both areas, pass protection and 
the run game. It’s our job to get 
them to do that.”
The return of senior left 
tackle Jon Runyan from injury, 
fresh off a first-team All-Big Ten 
campaign, promised to bring 
stability back to the unit. If the 
35-14 loss in Madison is any 
indication, it will take more than 
full health to restore order.
According to one unofficial 
count, senior quarterback Shea 
Patterson was hit 19 times 
in Saturday’s blowout loss at 
Wisconsin. After dealing with 
an oblique injury the first two 
weeks, Patterson left Saturday’s 
contest with a shoulder ailment, 

only to return in the fourth 
quarter. All the while, the 
Wolverines’ two quarterbacks 
completed just 17 of 42 pass 
attempts.
“That’s 
another 
area, 
we 
have got to do a better job of 
protecting the QB,” Harbaugh 
said. “Shea’s a tough guy, but you 
have to give him time to throw 
and make reads.”
Meanwhile, 
the 
rushing 
attack was stifled from the get-
go, ostensibly quitting on itself 
before too long. In total, the 
team rushed for just 40 yards 
on 19 carries, the fewest rushing 
yards in a game since a 2013 loss 
to Nebraska.
“I thought me coming back in 
this rotation on the offensive line 
would help see our struggles the 
first two games,” Runyan said, 
“and it was really disheartening 
that I felt like I wasn’t really able 
to to do anything extra out there 
to help us do any better.”
Through three weeks, the 
rebranded 
Michigan 
offense 
has toiled in all-too-familiar 
confusion. Intended to be an 
offense predicated on options, 
it has instead been defined by 
indecision and incoherence. The 
unit has averaged just 5.1 yards 
per play and has accumulated 
nine turnovers. Even against 
two teams with drastic talent 
gaps, the offense has struggled 
to move the ball downfield with 
any balance or regularity.
Some 
of 
these 
offensive 
struggles 
fall 
on 
scheme. 
Others on play-calling. But no 
small share has been delegated 
to an offensive line that has 
categorically 
under-achieved 
thus far.
“We’ve got backs that need 
holes. We expect our offensive 
line to move people, and that 
didn’t happen this past game,” 
Harbaugh said. “We weren’t as 
physical as our opponent on the 
offensive line or the defensive 

line.”
Added 
Runyan: 
“We 
got 
punched in the mouth, early and 
often, and we were never really 
able to recover from that. I take 
credit in being part of that and 
not being able to help this offense 
move in the way that I wanted.”
None of this is to say the group 
cannot find its footing. Just over 
a year ago, fans agonized over 
problems up front perceived to 
be irreversible. Led by an overall 
simplification from Warriner, 
the group steadily improved 
throughout the year. By the end, 
it was a bona fide strength.
That 
trajectory, 
though, 
makes the shaky start even more 
confounding. 
“Coming 
into 
the 
season, 
we thought we weren’t going 
to be back in this boat, kinda 
struggling,” Runyan said. “I 
don’t think we’re struggling too 
bad, how we were last year, with 
all the experience we got coming 
back. But, you know, you can’t 
credit Wisconsin enough. 
“... Like I said, we’re just trying 
to focus on us now. That game is 
behind us.”

Monday afternoon, a predictably 
stoic Jim Harbaugh stood in front 
of reporters, lamenting Michigan’s 
physicality and hustle in Saturday’s 
35-14 loss to Wisconsin.
A few minutes later, across the 
room, fifth-year senior left tackle 
Jon Runyan echoed his coach’s 
sentiment.
“Looking back on the film, not 
trying to call out anyone, but I feel 
like there were some plays where 
the effort could’ve been better,” 
Runyan said. “I think along with 
effort comes execution.”
With the root cause of Saturday’s 
debacle 
pinpointed, 
Harbaugh 
didn’t shy away from outlining his 
plan for this week’s practices.
“Emphasis 
on 
physicality, 
emphasis 
on 
toughness 
and 
emphasis on hustle,” Harbaugh 
said. “We’ll make that part of the 
practice plan more and also playing 
the players that are dedicated and 
playing physically at all times. Get 
those players in the ballgame.”
On the surface, it’s a striking 
indictment of his players. But 

Harbaugh wouldn’t call it that, 
instead looking introspectively 
and promising improvement from 
himself and the coaching staff.
That process, he said, would 
start with this week’s practices.
So when senior linebacker 
Josh Uche spoke with the media 
Tuesday evening, it took less than 
a minute for the topic of practice to 
come up.
“Oh, it was amped up,” Uche 
said. “We were ready to go, ready 
to hit somebody. Had some 9-on-7. 
Got real physical today.”
As for who brought that energy?
“Everybody,” Uche said. “Let 
some steam off, hit each other, 
man. Got real physical. Had a great 
practice today. … All our practices 
are physical, but today we made 
it an emphasis to come out and 
make this one of our really good 
practices.”
Of course, Uche knows that 
Saturday’s scar won’t be erased by 
practices. That part will have to 
wait until gamedays — specifically 
those against Penn State, Notre 
Dame, Michigan State and Ohio 
State.
But the road to getting there 

starts now, with an improved 
focus on the practice fields. So 
while talk throughout the bye 
week surrounded fixing the “little 
things,” it now centers on the 
macro — physicality, toughness, 
hustle.
According to fifth-year senior 
defensive end Michael Danna, 
that process of re-focusing started 
with 
the 
Wolverines’ 
senior 
leaders. Their weekly players’ 
meeting hasn’t happened yet, but 
the seniors have made their voices 
heard in the immediate aftermath 
of Saturday’s loss.
“We were all devastated,” 
Danna said. “We didn’t want to 
go out like that. We didn’t want to 
put that on national TV. We didn’t 
want that on our record or on our 
label or whatever. Cause that’s not 
our identity and that’s not how 
we play football. So you know, 
it’s all about bouncing back when 
adversity hits.”
Among Michigan’s senior class, 
Danna is in a unique position, 
having transferred from Central 
Michigan as a graduate transfer 
last offseason. It gives him less 
experience in the Wolverines’ 
defense, sure, but it also gives 
him a wider perspective through 
which to view the unit’s identity.
“We’re a physical, hard-nosed 
defense,” Danna said. “There’s 
no doubt in my mind about that. I 
spent all camp being here, seeing 
it. There’s no doubt in my mind 
we’re a hard-nosed defense.”
Saturday afternoon, Michigan 
didn’t show it. Any Wolverine you 
ask will tell you as much. Now, 
the goal is to make sure it doesn’t 
happen again.
“Some things just didn’t go 
our way just because it didn’t, but 
some things were fundamental 
errors,” 
Danna 
said 
of 
the 
Wisconsin game. “But like I said, 
that’s what practice is for. We’re 
gonna correct some things and

Wolverines looking to replace 
three key blueliners this season

Things look very different on 
the blueline for Michigan this 
year.
Last season, the Wolverines 
were led defensively by Quinn 
Hughes, Joseph Cecconi and 
Nicholas Boka. Hughes was 
drafted No. 7 overall by the 
Vancouver Canucks in June 
2018 and spent the vast majority 
of last season playing on the 
top 
defensive 
pairing 
with 
Cecconi, who joined the Dallas 
Stars after the season ended. 
Boka, while not the headliner 
that Hughes and Cecconi were, 
held down the right side of the 
second pairing and headed 
for the AHL’s Iowa Wild after 
graduating.
With three of its staple 
defensemen 
off 
to 
play 
professional hockey, Michigan 
now has to figure out how to fill 
their roles.
“We’re going to lose a little bit 
of everything,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson on Tuesday. 
“Some offense I think for sure 
with Quinn and Cecconi. Nick 
didn’t add a lot of offense, but 
he did log some minutes on the 
power play. I think that’s an area 
that we have to make sure we 
find someone to come in.”
Senior 
defenseman 
and 
alternate captain Luke Martin 
put things a bit more simply.
“We’re just losing a lot of 
minutes.”
Martin and classmate Griffin 
Luce should fill some of the 
void left by Hughes, Boka and 
Cecconi, but two players can’t 
fill the hole left by three. And the 
Wolverines’ other returners are 
sophomores Nick Blankenburg, 
Jack Summers and Jake Gingell, 
all of whom needed to take 
serious steps in the offseason to 
be ready for their bigger roles.
Gingell, in particular, had 
work to do to be prepared for a 
bigger role this year. He dressed 
for only one game last season 
and didn’t see any time on the ice 
in that matchup. Last December, 
Pearson said the biggest area 
Gingell needed to improve upon 

was his skating, and Pearson 
likes what he’s seen thus far.
“He’s made leaps and strides 
from where he was last year 
at this point,” Pearson said. 
“He’s fit, his footwork’s gotten 
better, he’s leaner. To me, the 
biggest thing was the skating 
and his ability to move and his 
quickness. He’s gotten so much 
better there. … He just looks so 
much more confident and good 
for him. You can tell he’s worked 
hard.”
Blankenburg and Summers 
filled larger roles than Gingell 
did last year, but going from 
freshmen 
with 
minimal 
expectations 
to 
sophomores 
who are expected to carry some 
of the load is a big step.
“That’s really up to them to 
decide, you know, how good do 
they want to be?” Martin said. 
“I think those are three guys 
that bring it every day and are 
really 
passionate 
about 
the 
culture here and bettering this 
program. And they’re in a great 
position here to really see some 
big opportunities.”
To bolster its thin defensive 
core after three key departures, 
Michigan added three new 
defensemen — two freshmen 
and a graduate transfer — this 
offseason.
Freshman 
Cam 
York 
headlines 
the 
incoming 
blueliners, as would be expected 
for the No. 14 overall pick. But 
Pearson is nearly just as excited 
about freshman Keaton Pehrson 
and graduate transfer Shane 
Switzer, both of whom should 

fill some of that stay-at-home 
blueliner role that Boka left 
behind.
Despite his enthusiasm about 
the new defensive additions, 
Pearson made it clear that 
he doesn’t want to put undue 
pressure 
on 
the 
freshmen, 
especially early in the year. His 
expectation is for the returners 
to shoulder the load, and the 
newcomers are expected to fill 
in the gaps.
“They’re not coming in to 
replace (the returners),” Pearson 
said. “It’s our returning guys 
who have to take bigger roles, 
like Summers and Blankenburg. 
Gingell, he’s going to get an 
opportunity. Those guys have to 
take bigger roles now this year. 
The freshmen have to be a good 
supporting cast, they don’t have 
to lead.”
Two 
weeks 
and 
change 
into practice, both Pearson 
and Martin are pleased with 
the growth they’ve seen from 
the returning players and the 
contributions the newcomers 
are making.
But the loss of two seniors 
and a first-round pick isn’t an 
easy one to absorb, especially 
for a team with limited depth 
defensively. 
On 
any 
given 
night, Pearson will dress six 
or seven defensemen — and 
the Wolverines have just eight 
defensive options on the roster. 
That leaves little room to breathe 
if there’s an injury and means 
that Michigan will be relying on 
all of its defensemen to step up 
and fill their designated roles.

M

y hands trembled as I carried my lap-
top in my sweaty palms, nervousness 
filling my brain. I walked with no 
urgency, trying to drag the process out as long as 
possible. I hoped for any sort of divine interven-
tion that would delay the event that was about to 
unfold: I had to present my writer’s notebook in 
front of my entire class. 
As I made my way to the podium, I placed the 
laptop down with a sense of trepidation, unsure of 
what would come next. I had presented in front of 
many classrooms before, but there was something 
different about this one — instead of the typical 
presentation, covering a topic from the class, I was 
presenting my fiction writing. 
This work was all my own, a journey into the 
depths of my creativity. Would my classmates like 
the style of my work, or would they find it bor-
ing? Would they understand the story, or would 
they pan its lack of plot development? I was trying 
something new but also very risky: showing what 
I thought passed for good fiction, which might 
have been completely opposite from what every-
one else thought.
Before we get to that story, let me backtrack for 
a minute. One day, in my 11th grade English class, 
I had a severe 
case of writer’s block 
while trying to write 
my writer’s notebook 
for the week. Every 
week, we had to write 
a one-to-two-page story 
about any topic we 
wanted and present it 
in front of the class, 
either sitting at 
your desk or at the 
class podium (you 
got more brownie 
points if you gave it 
at the podium). These 
pieces were a significant 
portion of my grade and 
much care had to go into 
crafting them. They had 
to be interesting; full 
of pithy literary 
description; and, 

more importantly, authentic. Try as I may have, 
I could not pull out an interesting life story from 
the depths of my brain that I wanted to share with 
the class. 
For my first entry, I tried to make watching a 
baseball game seem like an otherworldly experi-
ence, filled with an overload of visual description. 
On a trip the summer before my junior year of high 
school, I watched the Blue Jays game from the top 
of the CN Tower, the tallest building in Toronto. 
Watching from that far intrigued me. It was 
unlike any baseball game I had seen: The fans 
looked like mere dots in blue seats; the players on 
the field were barely discernible from the color 
of the grass. From that far up, I was unable to see 
the ball as a cue to what was happening in the 
game. Being the baseball buff that I am, my entry 
became about how the lack of visual clarity forced 
me to imagine what was happening in the game, 
and how I had to reach deep into my baseball 
knowledge to make sense of it at all. 
I stepped up to the plate and began to read my 
writing. While I thought this piece was quite cre-
ative, apparently my class and the teacher didn’t 
feel the same way, and I decided I needed to 
change tack. But to what, exactly? I wasn’t chock-
full of remarkable stories, and trying to make my 
boring life events seem interesting didn’t work. I 
went to my teacher for advice, and that’s when the 
spark hit me — I would pivot to writing fiction.
Given my history of writing creative stories, I 
should have realized it earlier, but I was too afraid 
to share my mystery stories with the class. Being 
the insecure eleventh grader that I was, I no lon-
ger had the burning desire of my seventh-grade 
self to share my fiction in front of such opinion-
ated teenagers. What if they found my ideas to 
be rip-offs, or too much like history class, or just 
plain boring? How could I keep them enthralled, 
without losing that all-important descriptive fac-
tor? I should write a story based off of Sherlock 
Holmes, with a continuing plot arc that would 
keep listeners coming back.
I would try to keep them in suspense with a 
murder mystery, with a few twists of my own. I 
wanted to set the stories in the modern-day, but 
the main character would travel back in time — 
incorporating my love of technology — and be 

forced to solve the mystery in order to return to 
the present. 
After adding in my love of history, I now had 
a story set in present-day England, with a brief 
flashback to the Victorian era, an enthralling peri-
od for me. The contrast between the technological 
advancements of the Industrial Revolution and 
the grittiness of 1890s London made for a perfect 
conflict and the presence of a modern-day charac-
ter trying to make sense of the past would make it 
more palpable for my contemporary audience. 
I thought I had a most pleasant idea, but I was 
still filled with doubt as to whether they would 
accept it. Standing at the podium, I was about to 
test that proposition. 
Though I was always uncomfortable speak-
ing in front of the class, I was more nervous than 
usual this time. I kept tripping over my words, the 
uncertainty still lingering over my voice. 
I started off the story in an old English coun-
try estate, with a man unsure as to his place in the 
modern world. He felt lonely and out of his time, 
looking for a way out of his boring life as a London 
banker. He wished he could be a detective, given 
his sharp mental skills, helping people solve their 
most pressing mysteries. Though he had plenty 
of money, he couldn’t find satisfaction, and was 
trying to fulfill it by buying a manor in the coun-
tryside, a respite from his busy city life. While on 
the house tour, he found a secret bookshelf in the 
study, and all of a sudden, he became absorbed 
into a roaring wind, and then a whole new world: 
1890s London. Thrown into this new environ-
ment, the main character decides to adopt the 
role of his favorite fictional character, Sherlock 
Holmes. To see whether this grand idea would 
work, you would have to wait for the next entry, 
and thus my series was born.
After I finally delivered the last word, I looked 
up to see what my audience thought, and to my 
complete surprise the spoken feedback was a 
lot more positive than I thought it would be. My 
teacher liked this a lot more, and I realized I did 
too. The formula was so plainly obvious I missed 
it: Write about something you are interested in, 
and that authenticity will shine through.

Reopening an old chapter in

T

here’s a 500-page book about my 
grandfather’s life sitting on my 
shelf.
“Book” might be an understatement. He 
titled it “memoir novel,” but “textbook” 
might be more accurate, due to its size. 
I’ve had my copy for over a decade and so 
far, it’s only been used for pressing leaves 
and four-leaf clovers. 
Grandpa passed away in May 2018. We 
weren’t very close — either the cause or 
effect of neglecting his memoir — which 
is why I didn’t know what to say while 
standing next to his bed in the hospital. 
I felt like I should come up with a long 
monologue about our relationship, but the 
words weren’t there.
Finally, I said, “I’m sorry I never read 
your book. I promise I will one day.” We 
sat in silence with my hand resting on his 
stomach. After a few minutes, his left eye 
fluttered open. 
I’d forgotten Grandpa had blue eyes. 
As I stared, I imagined him conversing 
with the thousands of people he met dur-
ing his life; he was suddenly the blue-eyed 

boy supporting his family in the South by 
selling boiled peanuts on the street, the 
high school prom king and football quar-
terback, the husband trying to navigate his 
two marriages. 
I’d never been this close to his face 
before. His eyelid was now only half-open, 
just enough to peek at who was touching 
him. It fell closed a few seconds later, and 
I wondered if my image even registered in 
his mind. 
When 
Grandpa’s 
memoir, 
“Boiled 
Peanuts and Buckeyes,” was published 
in 2006, he paid for our entire family to 
visit his hometown and attend his book-
launch event. I have a photo of him stand-
ing up and giving a speech, though I don’t 
remember what he said. Strangers walked 
up to his table afterward to have their cop-
ies signed. It was odd watching Grandpa 
interact with people who barely knew him 
but held his entire life in their hands.
He gave each of his grandchildren their 
own signed copy, as if to say, “Here’s my 
life, read it as you wish.”
After Grandpa’s death, I re-read the 

note: 
When you get older or maybe even now, 
you may enjoy reading about your mother’s 
family. The book also will come in handy if 
you need to prepare a family tree for one of 
your classes. I wish you a long and happy 
life.
Love, Grandpa Holland
It was strange to see his full name, Lee 
Eudon Holland, printed on the cover of the 
book but Love, Grandpa Holland signed 
inside. The title “Grandpa” seemed to give 
me a special license, a backstage pass to 
the information with an insider’s perspec-
tive. 
The truth was, the most I’d read of his 
book was the citation of my name in the 
index. I was mentioned once at the very 
end, a single name in a long list of grand-
children. His entire life as Grandpa Hol-
land was a mere epilogue to his story.
Grandpa loved stories. He dreamt that 
one day I would write a memoir of my 
own, knowing that I’ve been a writer 
since I was young. On multiple occasions, 
he suggested putting me in contact with 
local authors he knew, though I never fol-
lowed up on his offers. Later, he mailed me 
his copy of “Your Life as Story,” a how-to 
guide for memoir writers. I didn’t read it 
and realized I forgot to thank him. 
When I was a junior in high school, 
Grandpa emailed me after we hadn’t seen 
each other in a while. 
Since I don’t see you very often, I would 
like for you to share some of the things that 
happen in your life that have a lot of mean-
ing to you, he wrote. Just a few lines once a 
week or so ... 
He suggested he would send some 
excerpts from his memoir in return.
I emailed him a response of equal 
length about my own life and my thoughts 
about becoming a writer. He never replied, 
which I assumed was either because he 
was too busy or changed his mind. Even 
when I saw him in person for holidays, we 
never spoke of the email.
After he died, I searched for his name in 
my inbox and discovered he had actually 
sent me a dozen emails that were lost in 
my spam folder. They were spread out over 
a few years; congratulating me on a college 
scholarship, wishing me luck before I went 

skydiving, detailing how he met my grand-
ma. He never knew if I read them.
I felt more guilty than I had in my 
entire life. Shame pressed on my chest and 
weighed as much as the book itself — three 
and a half pounds, actually, according to 
my bathroom scale.
If I read his messages earlier, I would’ve 
known that Grandpa talked about his 
favorite song, “In the Pines,” a lot. Every-
one at the funeral seemed to know it. In the 
pines, in the pines / Where the sun don’t ever 
shine ... 
My dad spent the last few days trying to 
find the original version to play over the 
speakers at the visitation, but like most 
traditional folk songs, “In the Pines” has 
been shaped and remade as it was passed 
down through the generations. There’s no 
official author, lyrics or tune; its story is 
never finished, but rather echoed. 
I learned the song on the ukulele and 
played it with my family after the visita-
tion as a tribute, a way for me to connect 
with him in a way I couldn’t when he was 
alive.
Grandpa didn’t open his eyes again after 
he looked up at me in the hospital. I was 
the last person he saw. I was there for his 
last breath, too: a gulping, life-culminating 
gasp, like nothing I’d seen before. I didn’t 
understand why I deserved to be there at 
the end of his life, when I was only men-
tioned in his memoir once. 
But I don’t live in his memoir; I live as a 
folk song. I am a folk song, and I carry on 
his legacy of storytelling by writing about 
my life — just as he wrote about his. 
I thought of him when deciding on my 
senior thesis project for my creative writ-
ing degree: a collection of memoir pieces, 
using “Boiled Peanuts and Buckeyes” as 
a textbook. By the end of the year, I will 
have read the entire book cover to cover, 
picking out four-leaf clovers along the way.
Though our connection happened later 
than expected, I feel closer to Grandpa 
now than I did while he was alive. And 
I’m hoping that, in reading his stories, my 
journey as a writer can echo his own.
I wish you a long and happy life.
Love, Grandpa Holland

t is said that Frida Khalo despised gringolandia, 
otherwise known as the United States. She was 
deeply discomforted by what she called the 
frivolous gringo culture, and passed most of her time in 
the country feeling isolated and unfulfilled. 
In 1932, during the time she spent in Detroit while 
her husband, Diego Rivera, painted his famous “Detroit 
Industry Murals,” she created her “Self Portrait Along 
the Border Line Between Mexico and the United States.”
The composition shows her at the fringes of two 
opposing cultures, one grey and grounded on machinery 
and constant innovation, and the other organic and 
held by tradition and the elements. It is in this contrast 
between nature and industry that she expressed her 
discomfort with the forged and poised gringo culture 
and favored what seemed natural to her, Mexican 
tradition.
On one side of the canvas, the Mexico side, Kahlo 
painted two storming clouds. In one she depicted the 
moon and, in the other, the sun. They touched in the 
middle and created a storm, a natural phenomenon that 
brings both life and destruction. On the American side, 
she drew no clouds, only a thick fog of emissions that 
radiated from a Ford factory. In this fog, she painted the 
American flag.
This idea of exalting a country and its principles at 
the expense of nature and personal joy was running 
through my head as I entered the Rivera Court at the 
Detroit Institute of Arts. I had been living in the United 
States for over five years, and thought I had had enough 
exposure to gringo culture to know that I agreed with 
Kahlo.
All I could think about as I sat on a bench in the corner 
of the Rivera Court was my experience as a Mexican in 
the United States. I recalled the jarring culture shock 
that came when I was introduced to a society that 
seemed to only be preoccupied by hard work, on-paper 
accomplishments and material possessions.
I went through junior high and high school filling out 
one application after another, constantly trying to prove 
to my classmates and teachers that I belonged and I was 
not to be discarded; that I could adjust my way of being 
to fit their rigid norms of acceptability.

I polished my image and self-expression in accordance 
to the American code. I practiced, got rid of my accent, 
dressed in American brands and followed typical 
American teen rituals. I joined the dance team, dated 
a football player and mostly spent all of my time trying 
to do the “right” things to boost my college applications 
— trying to be a productive and obedient member of the 
American society because I felt it was the only way to 
achieve “success.”
Those years made me feel like Kahlo in her self-
portrait. I was stuck in the middle of two cultures, not 
really belonging to either, but striving to assimilate into 
one and forget the other. I thought a definitive decision 
had to be made. I was either going to become American, 
which meant hiding my “Mexicaness,” or I was going 
to be Mexican, which meant always being labeled as 
different or incompatible.
It was this perceived rigidity of culture that led me 
to sacrifice my Mexican mannerisms and traditions, so 
I made a choice. It was a decision I saw as absolute and 
necessary at the time. Like Kahlo, I felt like it had to be 
either-or because they were so different, a clear line 
separated them.
But when I came to the University of Michigan, 
traveled to Detroit and inspected the little seed of my 
culture that was planted there by Diego Rivera in 1933, 
I realized that I did not completely agree with Kahlo’s 
depiction of gringo culture. A lot of my ambivalence and 
feelings of alienation remained, but Rivera managed to 
make me feel included in his Mexican depiction of an 
American narrative.
The Detroit Industry Murals were breathtaking. I 
spent almost all of my time at the museum sitting on that 
corner bench, looking at every face and detail in each of 
the 27 frescoes painted by Rivera. 
The North Wall, which contains three of the most 
famous panels, shows the connections between nature 
and technology. The story these three panels tell is 
grounded in a common link, the only thing that is capable 
of both tradition and innovation: the human mind.
The panel closest to the ceiling shows human hands 
holding and extracting prime natural resources from the 
earth. The middle panel shows these natural resources 

being transformed by heat and funneled into the furnace 
of the bottom panel, which depicts a Ford factory.
The Ford factory panel, at bottom panel of the North 
Wall, depicts an echelon of contradictions. At the 
very top is the burning furnace. It appears small in 
the background, but it is connected to the rest of the 
depictions in the panel by snakelike conveyor belts that 
weave from side to side, separating various situations. 
On the left side, the conveyor belt encases an 
assembly line of glowing, green men who are seemingly 
affected by the toxic chemicals they are forced to work 
in. Automotive parts move in and out of their line 
through suspended crates, but workers are unaffected. 
Surrounded by heavy and dangerous looking machinery 
and toxic chemicals, all they seem to worry about is their 
work.
There is a clock in the background, near the top right 
corner. It depicts the passage of time, but nobody seems 
to be looking at it, as if their time was not their own.
Near the bottom is another assembly line, but this 
one depicts workers that were drawn by Rivera without 
sparing any details. They are focused and go on without 
talking. They pull and push auto parts together, oblivious 
to any danger and without risking a single, independent 
thought. 
At the very bottom, Rivera painted a series of grey 
panels showing small figures in line. He drew lines 
of people that form as they enter the factory, lines of 
furnaces emitting clouds of pollution into the air, lines 
of cars in parking lots and lines of men operating heavy 
machinery.
This panel depicts the American industry and the 
success driven Americans who work endlessly to make 
it happen. In the back, like a tiny red dot, is the finished 
product. The process seems to be more important 
here than the car itself. Through this, and through his 
multiracial depictions of the workers, Rivera emphasizes 
gringo culture values as attempting to be diverse and 
inclusive.
Rivera seemed to be a firm believer of the American 
Dream — of the Mexican American dream.
The vertical flow that bridges the top panel to the 
bottom one alludes to a linear narrative that connects

nature and industry. The North Wall of 
Rivera Court looked to me like a hopeful 
depiction for humanity, one that connects 
nature to innovation and sees technology as 
a possible equalizer and an extension of the 
human brain, and therefore nature.
During the hours I spent looking at each 
stroke and inspecting each figure, I saw 
themes of nature, diversity and growth 
contrasted by images of technology and 
innovation. I saw human beings using 
their intellect to create good and evil. I 
saw snakelike machines that wove through 
assembly lines of bleary-eyed men working 
mindlessly next to small frescoes of cells 
and doctors working on vaccinations. 
I saw everyone working together and 
creating technology for the advancement of 
mankind.
Each panel told a different story, and 
together they created a more holistic view 
of Rivera’s ideas of American industry and 
society.
Unlike Kahlo in her “Self Portrait Along 
the Border Line Between Mexico and the 
United States,” Rivera seemed to have a 

more open-ended perspective of what he 
observed in Detroit, the pinnacle American 
industry at the time.
He did not think the cultures lived 
separated by a definitive line, nor that a 
choice needed to be made between them. 
Rather, he used his Mexican eyes to see an 
American thing, as he saw the innovation 
and technology as natural and ground 
breaking.
This made me reconsider my own 
opinions about my time in the United 
States. The strokes and lines of the “Detroit 
Industry Murals” also told a story I felt 
deeply connected to. They told a story 
of opportunity and transformation, one 
of a hopeful future and of a harmonious 
relationship between tradition, identity and 
respect. 
After all, I found a way to make gringo 
culture my own. I found a way to keep my 
Mexican identity and lifelong traditions, 
while also respecting my new environment 
and expecting respect back. I am constantly 
redrawing and repainting my furnace and 
the conveyor belts that connect my life, 
personality and culture to American society. 
I didn’t know it at the time, but I started 

forging my gringo experience my first day in 
the United States. 
I made friends with people who were 
like me, who were bilingual and who were 
also trying to strike a balance between two 
identities. People who did not always feel 
respected or valued by gringo culture, but, 
like me, were finding ways to demand it. 
I started rebelling against the idea of 
having to chose a culture and inserted pieces 
of my childhood, Mexican traditions into 
American ones. I started connecting with 
my parents more and realized that there is 
no right or wrong way to “be Mexican.” I 
realized that I just had to be myself, and that 
whoever I became would just be Mexican.
This constant innovation allowed me to 
keep the aspects of gringo culture that I 
liked, and discard most of those that did not 
make me feel like myself. Most importantly, 
it allowed me to expand and redraw myself.

continuously open myself up to new 
experiences and people. While working on 
my “success” as defined by the American 
code (read high paying job in a competitive 
field), I also realized I have the agency 
to accept and discard each part of gringo 

culture that I do and don’t like.
The American norms of acceptability are 
the same, but it is me who has changed. I 
am no longer trying to prove that I belong, 
because I don’t want to be an obedient 
member of American society. I moved here 
to expand and redraw myself, and one of 
the privileges that came with moving to the 
United States is the added perspective that it 
gave me. I can see its traditions from a third-
person point of view and decide which ones 
I want to incorporate into my version of 
gringo culture.
Whenever I meet someone new, I tell 
them that my being here at all is a miracle. 
I never imagined myself as a student of any 
university in the United States, much less 
one like U-M. I never thought I would have 
platforms to express my individuality, much 
less think of myself as an individual with as 
much agency as I currently possess.
I think this is why I was so drawn to the 
“Detroit Industry Murals.” Rivera crafted a 
hybrid culture in his frescoes. He used his 
Mexican perspective to paint an American 
institution, and he didn’t solely focus on its 
drawbacks.


I 

have a favorite font.
It’s not like my favorite movie 
or my favorite food, where I’d 
need some time to think or debate 
between two or three options. It is 
my one, singular favorite font. When 
I watch it appear across the screen, I 
see the work that was put in designing 
and redesigning its curves and edges. 
I see the work I put in, as a designer, 
when I use it. In my years of working 
with it, I’ve learned so many funny 
facts and anecdotes about 
this font that I’ll never 
forget. 
I know it’s free on Mac but 
not on Windows, because 
it loads on my computer, 
but it comes up missing on 
my dad’s. When I helped 
my father design his book, 
we 
stumbled 
across 
this 
challenge. 
I 
know 
the 
spacing between the letters 
is 
uniform 
because 
it’s 
different from many other 
fonts. I know it was invented 
in Switzerland in the 50s, 
but 
my 
favorite 
version 
is a redesign from 1983. I 
know it’s part of the neo-
grotesque style because I 
heard someone say that once, 
though I’m not sure what that 
means. I remember watching 
a 
documentary 
about 
it, 
which was just OK, but 
I’m happy for the director, 
because it got shown at the 
Museum of Modern Art in 
New York City. I know it’s 
the font they use in the New 
York subway system because 
I found a book about it. 
For a font, the extent of 
scholarship on Helvetica is 
astounding. 
Helvetica 
Neue 
— 
Helvetica Neue Bold to be 
exact — makes me feel calm. 
Newsrooms 
and 
design 
projects can be stressful, but 
ultimately Helvetica Neue 
is as dependable as a song I 
know all the words to. Years 
ago, when I first saw it, I fell in love 
with how clean it looked on the page, 
and that was before design was a big 
part of my life. 
Helvetica opened my world to 
modern editorial design. I remember 
when I first saw it in the red and 
white Supreme logo and a couple of 
European magazines. I remember 
how cleansing it felt when my paper 
in high school switched to Helvetica 
Neue from Futura, a slightly older, 
more emotive font. Suddenly, all 

the unnecessary, deco-thickness of 
Futura was streamlined by the perfect 
ratios in Helvetica. It became my 
platonic ideal for what a San Serif font 
should be. 
I judged every other font I came 
across against Helvetica. Recently, 
I’ve even experimented with the light 
version of the font because I like its 
lanky structure. It looks like a baby 
deer standing on two long, skinny 
legs. Helvetica is convenient for me, 

as a designer. It goes well with other 
fonts because it’s so uncomplicated 
and rational, and people like it for the 
same reason. 
I had discovered what everyone 
already knew about Helvetica — it’s 
good. No one hates Helvetica. It’s 
not controversial. It’s a strong font. 
Because there’s really nothing to 
dislike, there are no wacky aspects like 
the faux-handwriting on famously-
memed Comic Sans. It’s a perfect font 
for the minimalist design trend going 

on right now, and because of that, it’s 
basic. 
So, I guess I’m a basic font girl … if 
there is such a thing. I picked one of the 
most mainstream fonts in the world to 
be my font of choice forever. I love the 
same font that North Face, Energizer, 
Post-it and Drake love. It’s similar to 
liking pizza more than all other foods, 
or watching The Notebook every day 
because you really think it’s the best 
movie out there. 

Other designers would understand 
that it’s popular and understand that 
the angles and the thicknesses are 
meticulous. They get that it’s famous 
and can even respect that it looks 
good, but they would be shocked — 
floored — to know that I picked such 
a basic font to be my favorite. 
Every 
day, 
beautiful 
fonts 
are 
designed and put up for sale through 
links in Instagram bios and on 
the Adobe social media platform, 
Behance. A French design house 

that I follow on social media just put 
up a new one called Cako with two 
different versions of R and K that each 
have unique beveling. The different 
versions of each letter are either 
concave or convex, leaving which to 
use up to the designer’s discretion. 
This choice comes along with thick 
serifs and differing line weights on 
different parts of letters. The overall 
effect is gorgeous; it’s a clean but busy 
font that is staunchly modern but not 
lacking in character.
Fonts, especially on social 
media, are an exploding cottage 
industry. An indie font found 
on Instagram with a lot of 
quirks that costs 80 euros to 
download … that’s a cool favorite 
of many millennials. Anyone 
with the Adobe suite and the 
talent can produce a font in 
today’s world. Like many other 
creative endeavors, it’s been 
democratized so anyone with 
an idea can sell work without a 
label. 
People 
put 
in 
serious, 
innovative work designing and 
creating fonts. In fact, I think we 
might be in a font renaissance. 
Fonts skew the meaning of 
letters before they’re even words 
— a single letter can look stoic or 
heartbroken depending on the 
typeface. The process of mapping 
out every angle and every curve 
in each letter of the alphabet, 
punctuation mark and number 
is 
painstaking. 
With 
people 
putting 
themselves 
through 
design hell to make new fonts, I 
feel silly being so obsessed with 
a font that’s over 60 years old. 
Helvetica Neue was designed 
to make me love it. The height 
and width of letters throughout 
the typeface is uniform, and 
each letter has a little pillow 
of space around it. It’s cute 
in its technicality and in its 
uniformity. The way the tail of 
the “g” almost touches the little 
bubble part and the way the dots 
on “i” and “j” hover perfectly 
in line with the rest of the letter are 
soothing to me. It is designed to have 
no message of its own — to be a blank 
canvas for designers to put meaning 
into with placement and sizing and 
to give meaning by organizing it into 
words and phrases. When I look at 
Helvetica Neue, I see years of work 
— my work. I see my editors and 
colleagues, work I’m proud of and 
work that I’m not.
My whole design career is there, in 
this font.
