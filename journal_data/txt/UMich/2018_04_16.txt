Through internal means, 
fraternities and sororities at 
the University of Michigan 
have 
been 
attempting 
to 
address issues of diversity, 
equity and inclusion, but face 
an obstacle in obtaining buy-in 
from across all four Greek life 
councils. 
More than 6,000 students 
are involved in Greek life at 
the University of Michigan 
according to the Office of 
Greek 
Life. 
Representing 
approximately 20 percent of 
the undergraduate population, 
the community often struggles 
with 
negative 
perceptions, 

perpetuated by a national 
narrative and a turbulent past 
year for the University’s Greek 
life community.
Apart from the lack of 
demographic diversity among 
traditionally white fraternities 
and sororities, disparities also 
emerge in areas like parties.
Students have noted police 
tend to shut down festivities 
hosted by traditionally Black 
fraternities more than those 
hosted by white fraternities. 
Many Black students have 
experienced overt racism at 
fraternity parties in recent 
years. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Moe 
Charara transferred to the 
University of Michigan this 
semester. He never seriously 
considered studying abroad at 
his previous college. However, 
with some research and help 
from the Center for Global and 
Intercultural Study, Charara 
will be studying in Greece this 
coming summer.
“At my old university, we had 
a few study abroad programs, 
but (they) weren’t too serious 
or anything,” Charara said. “I 
went to the CGIS office to see 
what they had to offer and see if 
I could use the opportunities U 
of M had.”
Charara said CGIS helped 
find scholarships and programs 
that would suit him and for 
which he could earn credit.
“There are so many ways 
to cover the costs for these 
programs,” Charara said. “U of 
M does give a lot of scholarships. 
(CGIS advisers) are really cool 
and they’ve helped me a great 
deal.”
According 
Scholarship 
Program 
Assistant 
Director 
Doug 
Fletcher, 
the 
LSA 
Scholarship Office works closely 
with CGIS to make students 
aware of the available resources 
the University provides.
“Scholarships are all need-
based,” 
Fletcher 
said. 
“We 
recognize that financial aid 
provides 
great 
support 
for 

students to go abroad. For many 
students, there’s still a gap 
between what financial aid can 
provide and what they need to 
go.”
For the 2016-2017 school year, 
Fletcher said the Scholarship 
Program provided a total of 
$1.7 million in scholarships, 
with an average of $4,200 given 
per student. Out of the 708 
applicants, 407 were awarded 
scholarships.

“Students 
have 
to 
have 
financial need, that’s the first 
thing,” Fletcher said. “Out of 
the 708, some of them don’t 
have need or didn’t file a FAFSA. 
Some of those students were 
packaged fully, given all the 
funding 
they 
needed 
from 
financial aid or departmental 
resources. We awarded every 
student that wasn’t packaged 
fully already.”
Despite being ineligible for 

financial aid, LSA junior Kallie 
Bernas was unable to afford 
a program through the LSA 
Opportunity Hub to research 
abroad in Berlin this summer.
“I didn’t have the money to 
support myself without being 
paid for the research I would 
have been doing,” Bernas said. 

In 2016, the state of Michigan 
was 
ranked 
sixth 
in 
the 
United States for its number of 
homeless students. Jennifer Erb-
Downward, a senior research 
associate 
with 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Poverty 
Solutions 
initiative, 
analyzed 
data 
surrounding 
schoolchildren 
who are considered homeless. 
Underfederal 
education 
law 
homelessness is defined as all 
children and youth who “lack 
a fixed, regular, and adequate 
nighttime residence.”
“Michigan 
had 
the 
sixth 
largest 
number 
of 
homeless 
students in the United States,” 
Erb-Downward said. “That’s over 
36,000 students in the 2015-2016 
school year. That’s a very large 
number of children who are going 
to school while experiencing the 
instability of not knowing where 
they’re going to sleep at night, not 
knowing whether or not they’re 
going to be able to stay in school 
or have to transfer.”

In interview with The Daily, VP for Student Life says Greek rush changes not punitive

On 
Friday 
afternoon, 
The 
Michigan Daily sat down with 
Vice President for Student Life 
E. Royster Harper for the final 

interview 
of 
the 
term. 
The 
conversation included discussions 
on recent administrative approval 
to change the names of C.C. 
Little 
Science 
Building 
and 
Winchell House, Greek life winter 
recruitment, and the recent CSG 
elections.
TMD: Seeing as the recent 
approval to change the names of 

C.C. Little and the Winchell House 
in West Quad took place after many 
protests from various students and 
student organizations on campus, 
it can be said the names of various 
buildings, plaques, etc. at the 
University impact student life on 
campus. In an interview about 
the renaming recommendations, 
President Schlissel said “We don’t 

want the names of things to be 
changing as fashions change.” Do 
you suspect this will be a common 
occurrence or is the bar too high 
after Little and Winchell to change 
building names?

The University of Michigan 
is not on track to reach its 2025 
emissions goals, according to 
Environment and Sustainability 
graduate student Tyler Fitch’s 
research.
In 
2011, 
the 
University 
promised 
to 
reduce 
its 
greenhouse gas emissions 25 
percent below 2006 emissions 
levels. 
By 
combining 
data 
from the Office of Campus 
Sustainability 
and 
a 
report 
by the University President’s 
Greenhouse 
Gas 
Reduction 
Committee, 
Fitch 
tracked 
the University’s progress and 
found they will not fulfill this 
commitment if they continue on 
their current trajectory.
Fitch was inspired to conduct 
research 
on 
the 
emissions 
gap 
after 
returning 
from 
the 
November 
U.N. 
climate 
conference in Bronn, Germany. 
During his time in Germany, he 
decided to act on the calls for 
community action.

Time is almost out to save 
“Michigan time,” the tradition 
of starting classes ten minutes 
after the scheduled hour at the 

University of Michigan. However, 
state Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann 
Arbor, among other concerned 
alumni and students, are fighting 
to preserve this custom.
Students 
and 
alumni 
have 
spoken 
out 
against 
the University’s decision in 
February to end Michigan time. 
U-M students started a Facebook 
event — “Boycott the End of 
Michigan Time” — with more 
than 1,200 people interested 
in and 300 going to a boycott 
of the first day of spring term 
classes May 1. Representatives 
of 
the 
University’s 
Central 
Student Government also raised 
questions about the decision to 
Dean of Students Laura Blake 
Jones at a meeting shortly after 
the announcement was made.
Rabhi, a University alum, 
has taken the issue of Michigan 
time to the Michigan House 
of 
Representatives. 
Rabhi 
proposed an amendment to the 
state higher education budget 
during a Thursday meeting 
for the House Appropriations 
Subcommittee 
on 
Higher 
Education. 
Though 
Rabhi’s 
amendment was not adopted, 
he maintains his commitment 
to helping students at his alma 
mater.
“I am committed to doing 
all I can to help students at our 
universities have the support 
and tools they need to be 
successful,” Rabhi said in a 
statement to MLive. “Michigan 
time has been a treasured 
tradition at the University for 
more than 80 years, providing 
students 
and 
faculty 
the 
flexibility they need to navigate 
campus and arrive at class with 
enough time. This tradition 
is one of many that gives the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
its 
unique character, and I would 
be sad to see it abandoned.”
Michigan time is currently 
scheduled to end May 1, after 
which classes will start at the 
hour and instead end 10 minutes 
early. University officials cited 
a need for consistency among 
campuses and schools as a 
reason for the change.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald explained in February 
the University’s decision was 
motivated by requests for a more 
uniform schedule to facilitate 
collaboration 
among 
schools 
on campus that currently use 
Michigan time and those that do 
not, such as the School of Nursing.
“I’d say one of the hallmarks 
of our campus is cross-University 
collaboration,” Fitzgerald said. 
“From school and colleges and 
departments 
and 
different 
units who are constantly cross-
pollinating all of our efforts, and 
this really facilitates that … We’re 
just eliminating one of those 
stumbling blocks.”
Instead 
of 
starting 
early, 
classes after May 1 will now end 
10 minutes before the scheduled 
hour to allow students to continue 
scheduling classes back-to-back 
with adequate travel time.
LSA sophomore Lexi Michaels 
predicts 
ending 
Michigan 
time will cause confusion for 
professors instead of making 
scheduling easier.
“I really like Michigan time. 
I think it makes so much sense, 
especially when you have back-to-
back classes,” Michaels said. “It 
gets your day rolling. I think that 
(this new system) is just a cause 
for disaster. I think that professors 
are way more aware of starting 10 
minutes late because they haven’t 
started yet, but if they have to end 
10 minutes early, they’re not going 
to know to stop.”
Despite the protests of current 
students and alumni like Rabhi, 
University 
Provost 
Martin 
Philbert claims to have received 
positive 
feedback 
about 
the 
change.
“Especially 
through 
Vice 
President Royster’s office, we 
have worked with many student 
organizations,” Philbert said. “In 
my experience, there’s been an 
enormous sigh of relief that we’re 
all going to be operating on the 
same expectations of starting and 
finishing.”

ON THE DAILY: MICHIGAN TIME ALMOST UP


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Michigan in Color
Monday, April 16, 2018 — 3A

Aishu 
Chandrakanthan 
is 

a junior at the University of 
Michigan studying business and 
psychology with a minor in digital 
studies. On campus, she is involved 
with United Asian American 
Organizations, Indian American 
Student Association, Yoni Ki Baat 
and the Michigan Fashion Media 
Summit. She can be contacted at 
caishu@umich.edu. 

THE MICHIGAN DAILY: Tell 

me a little about you and your 
family.

CHANDRAKANTHAN: I’ve 

always struggled to understand 
how to express who I am. I’m Sri 
Lankan, but I’m Tamil — which 
is not the ethnic majority in Sri 
Lanka. I’m a Canadian citizen 
and most of my family lives in 
Canada, but I’ve lived in America 
for most of my life. Because of 
this, I’ve struggled with not really 
fitting in anywhere.

I don’t feel truly like a Sri 

Lankan 
Tamil-Canadian 

sometimes because I didn’t have 
the same experience as those 
who are Sri Lankan Tamil in 
Canada. I didn’t grow up going to 
Tamil school or weddings every 
weekend, in between classical 
singing classes with Sri Lankan 
friends whose parents went to the 
same high school as mine.

And even though I grew up 

exposed to Indian-Tamil culture, 
because of my “Amma’s” love for 
India and since my family owns 
an Indian grocery store; I never 
fit in with Indian Tamils because 
I don’t have the Indian-Tamil 
dialect, so it made it hard to 
communicate my thoughts.

When I’m in the United 

States, I don’t always feel like I 
fit in because I’m not particularly 
familiar with American pop 
culture and politics. I didn’t 
listen to English music until I was 
12-years-old and I rarely watched 
Hollywood films.

Despite this confusion and 

struggle to find my identity, I like 
that there is some mystery around 
who I am.

My family came to Canada as 

refugees because of the civil war 
in Sri Lanka. My “Appa” left when 
he was 17 for Germany, but he 
later came to Canada as a refugee 
in order to find a better life for 
himself and the rest of his family. 
My Amma had also escaped Sri 
Lanka when she was 16-years-old 
to live in India.

My Appa passed away ten 

years ago, so my Amma has been 
wary of taking my brother and me 
back to Sri Lanka alone because 

she doesn’t consider it safe. While 
my Appa was able to escape most 
of the horrors of the war, my 
Amma actually got caught in the 
crossfire.

Back then, in Sri Lanka, a 

Tamil liberation group called the 
Tamil Tigers started a separatist 
movement 
to 
create 
Tamil 

Eelam, a country just for the 
Tamil ethnic group. They often 
used violent tactics to get their 
messages across. During one of 
her visits back to Sri Lanka during 
her school break, Amma and my 
“Ammama” had gotten badly 
injured from a bomb blast. That 
night left most of my Ammama’s 
arm severely injured, wounds 
on my Amma’s leg and severe 
PTSD that has left them both 
traumatized for the rest of their 
lives.

The Tamil Tigers also sent 

a suicide bomber to India to 
assassinate then Prime Minister 
Rajiv Gandhi. After that, many 
restrictions were imposed on Sri 
Lankan Tamil refugees in India. 
My Amma was affected by that 
— she couldn’t get the education 
she wanted because the Indian 
government only allowed Sri 
Lankan Tamils to study certain 
subjects.

I feel like my Amma always 

associated being Sri Lankan with 
being unable to achieve her life’s 
goals. She really embraces Indian 
culture and considers it her 
home, while my Appa was very 
Sri Lankan. I always wondered 
why she was so against her 
own country, but then I learned 
to understand why it was so 
different for her. Sri Lanka was 
so shaped by war that, for her, 
the experiences of getting hurt 
and having limited freedom made 
it easier for her to just distance 
herself from her country. She 
always talks about how beautiful 
Sri Lanka was and how the war 
ruined everything.

TMD: Has having a Sri Lankan 

Tamil identity distanced you 
from the larger South Asian 
community on campus?

CHANDRAKANTHAN: 
I 

think I’m lucky. Because my 
family has owned an Indian 
grocery store for twelve years, 
growing up, I was able to 
immerse myself in the Indian 
culture and community. I grew 
up watching movies in different 
Indian languages such as Telugu 
and Malayalam, so I used this as 
a way to connect with my peers 
in the Indian American Student 
Association (IASA) community. 
However, I still never felt like I 
fit in.

Even when it comes to Tamil 

people in IASA, I still feel that we 
have very different backgrounds. 

Their parents didn’t grow up in 
Sri Lanka, experience a war and 
aren’t refugees. A lot of people 
don’t know what happened in Sri 
Lanka, so they don’t understand 
the struggles that my parents 
experienced while coming to this 
country.

In the past year, I’ve realized 

that a lot of my South Asian 
friends have parents who could 
get the education and careers 
they wanted. My Amma wasn’t 
able to do that. Her Sri Lankan 
identity 
prevented 
her 
from 

studying what she wanted.

A lot of South Asian people 

don’t realize that Sri Lankan 
Tamils 
had 
to 
go 
through 

different obstacles to achieve the 
same level of success as other 
South Asians. My family members 
had to go through extreme and 
nontraditional methods to end 
up in this country, away from the 
war raging at home.

 TMD: What weight does your 

identity as a Sri Lankan Tamil and 
Asian/Pacific Islander American 
(A/PIA) hold for you? 

CHANDRAKANTHAN: 
I 

don’t feel that I am able to fully 
identify as an A/PIA, because 
the term seems to suggest very 
specific experiences — ones that 
tend to exclude South Asians. A 
lot of the A/PIA spaces on campus 
are more representative of East 
Asians and it’s often hard to find 
other Brown people, nonetheless 
Sri Lankan Tamils.

However, the A/PIA community 

on campus has also been one of the 
most accepting communities I’ve 
been a part of. Even though there 
aren’t many Sri Lankan Tamils, I 
feel that I have been able to bond 
with others in the community who 
similarly may have felt like they 
had difficulty finding communities 
throughout their lives. I’m excited 
for the next year, because I look 
forward to being more involved in 
organizations such as Uncover: A/
PIA and UAAO where I can hear 
other people’s stories and share my 
own.

TMD: Has your conception of 

your identity as an A/PIA shifted 
over the course of your life?

CHANDRAKANTHAN: 
In 

high school, I was surrounded by 
a very different group of people. 
Though there was a huge South 
Asian community in Novi, I wasn’t 
super involved in it. I had South 
Asian friends, but my closest friend 
group consisted of my Taiwanese, 
Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese 
and Korean friends. However, 
I still felt out of place because I 
felt like they all had their own 
communities. 

Combating the Monolith: IV

When 
Drew 
Metcalf, 
an 

LSA 
junior 
studying 
screen 

arts and culture, submitted his 
project proposal to optiMize’s 
Social 
Innovation 
Challenge, 

he had no idea he would end up 
forming a creative expression 
showcase that would impact 
more than 150 students. With 
a strong passion for creativity 
and art, Metcalf has a natural 
drive for building community, 
cultural 
understanding 
and 

confidence — all through the 
power of expression. With his 
new organization, Creatives of 
Color, Metcalf is using art to 
revolutionize how students of 
color come together.

The purpose of Creatives of 

Color is to foster connections 
among 
artists 
of 
color 
by 

providing 
opportunities 
for 

collaboration, expression and 
networking. 
Its 
platform 
is 

centered 
around 
providing 

support and resources to give 
students 
the 
freedom 
and 

means to pursue their creative 
initiatives.

Metcalf got his start from 

optiMize, a social innovation 
organization 
dedicated 
to 

inspiring students to initiate 
self-driven products to work 
toward a more sustainable world. 
Through 
optiMize, 
Metcalf 

received 
mentor 
support, 

visioning workshops and an 
expansive network to help him 

make his mission a tangible 
reality. To formally introduce 
his organization, Metcalf held a 
creative showcase April 11.

The showcase featured an 

expansive range of art, such as 
photography, animation, singing, 
dance and poetry. It featured 
projects from 25 participants 
of varying cultures, ages and 
majors, adding to the diverse 
makeup of projects presented.

In 
preparation 
for 
the 

showcase, 
Metcalf 
said 
he 

and his team randomly paired 
students together as he wanted 
to explore the creative capacity 
that could come from strangers. 
Metcalf and his team provided 
guidance 
and 
assistance 
to 

student 
teams. 
He 
hoped 

students would feel encouraged 
and confident enough to pursue 
creative means not traditionally 
explored.

“We wanted to showcase all 

kinds of art. When people think 
of creative work, they jump to 
music, poetry and dance. But, we 
also have committees for other 
written art, like journalism and 
creative writing,” he said. 

Though the showcase received 

an immensely positive response, 
it did not occur without setbacks 
and moments of discouragement. 
As the term went on, more and 
more groups dropped out due 
to academic demands and other 
time restraints.

However, 
Metcalf 
stayed 

optimistic, 
commenting 
even 

if two people showed up to the 
showcase, as long as everyone 

had fun, the work would not go 
to waste.

“There were a couple of times 

that I wanted to throw in the 
towel … But my team kept me 
grounded,” he said.

Drew’s project was received so 

well that it solidified additional 
funding, which will allow the 
organization to continue active 
development over the summer. 
His summer project will consist 
of building the social network 
of professional and aspiring 
creatives, striving to bridge the 
gap between access to resources 
and mentors.

With 
this 
amount 
of 

momentum, it is clear that 
Creatives of Color has a bright 
and 
eventful 
future 
ahead. 

Future plans include creative 
workshops, 
collaborations, 

exhibitions and youth outreach. 
As the organization is still in 
its infancy, the possibilities are 
wide open, and Metcalf is ready 
to take them head-on.

“The cool thing about (this 

project) 
is 
that 
there’s 
so 

much room for creativity and 
innovation. There are so many 
things we can we can do with 
this organization, and the ideas 
keep coming. I’m interested to 
see what comes of it,” he said 
while smiling.

Art as a creative revolution

Every morning, I find myself 

walking to class listening to my 
favorite songs, watching squirrels 
as they finesse food from passersby 
and moving around white people 
walking in my direction on the 
sidewalks. Before I noticed this 
disturbing pattern of mine, I 
always thought that stepping 
out of the way for oncoming 
pedestrians was just the polite 
thing to do. However, I recently 
noticed that the oncoming traffic, 
specifically when the person was 
white, would never return the 
common courtesy of stepping 
to the side when I walked by. I 
began to ask myself questions and 
wonder if I was carrying out the 
same subconscious behavior with 
people of other races. So, I decided 
to experiment a bit. Whenever a 
person of color walked by, I made 
space — while carefully watching 
if they would do the same. I tried 
doing this with people of color in 
large groups, small groups and 
by themselves. Each occurrence 
led to the same outcome: mutual 
respect for sidewalk space. This 
data then led me to the belief that 
this was a natural behavior of only 
white people, notably among white 
women.

After coming to such conclusion, 

I decided to try something even 
riskier: not move at all when 
white people passed by. I thought 
perhaps the confidence of a large, 
stocky Black woman standing her 
ground would make a difference 
and would be a call for change. 

But hell, was I wrong. Instead of 
change, I got shoulder bumped and 
glared at, commonly followed by 
snarky remarks such as, “Watch 
where you’re going,” “Wow that 
was rude” or “I can’t believe she 
just did that.” Of them all, it was 
the repetitive comment of “I 
can’t believe she just did THAT.” 
Confused on what “that” was 
referring to. 

As I continued my investigation 

of this behavior, I became aware 
of some not-so-surprising history 
of racial tensions and practices 
of white supremacy. I was in 
Associate 
Professor 
Stephen 

Berrey’s American South course 
when he started the lecture by 
talking about the more blatant and 
explicit forms of Jim Crow and 
racial superiority. He then clicked 
on a slide informing the class about 
more subtle practices in Southern 
states. He went on to state that 
“the expectation that Black people 
would step off the sidewalk for 
approaching white people was a 
common custom across the South 
that had extended back into the 
days of slavery (in which enslaved 
people were expected to step off). 
The incident (that exemplifies this 
was) in Danville, Va., in 1883 during 
an election year in which many 
white people were alarmed over 
growing Black political power and 
fears that Black people considered 
themselves the social equal of 
white people — as evidenced by the 
refusal to perform expected roles.” 
And many decades later, during 
the Jim Crow era, Black people 
continued to step off the sidewalk 
when a white person were to walk 
in their direction. Otherwise as 

noted previously, if a Black person 
failed to do so, they were acting 
as defiant, uppity and downright 
disrespectful. Now it all makes 
sense. 
This 
demonstration 
of 

subservience during such a simple 
thing like walking on the sidewalk 
was not and is not my fault. Instead, 
it is deep-rooted racism and white 
supremacy among white people 
that led me to feel inferior, just as 
my ancestors felt during the Jim 
Crow era, and much earlier.

But wait — there’s more.
I didn’t just notice this flat-out 

disrespect and sense of superiority 
on the University of Michigan’s 
campus.

I’ve experienced it in the halls 

of high schools, where younger 
white students would do the same 
thing. I’ve experienced it walking 
downtown Detroit, a place where 
many white people dramatically 
state that they are afraid to go, yet 
there they are, subtly enforcing 
white supremacy. I’ve experienced 
it in grocery stores, malls and just 
about anywhere you could think of.

But now, I don’t move. I don’t 

budge. I don’t care. I don’t care 
whose shoulder I bump into, 
whose avocado matcha smoothie 
I spill or whose day I ruin. Why? 
Because every day that this 
continues to happen to other 
students, especially Black students, 
the more embedded and unnoticed 
it becomes, and the further it goes. 
So now when you see me walking 
and I don’t move, do not think it is 
because I am just another stuck up 
Black girl with an attitude, know 
it’s because I’m sick and tired and a 
change is bound to come. One step 
at a time.

Fighting white supremacy

Today, I had the honor of 

receiving 
the 
Wendy 
Owen 

Scholarship from The Michigan 
Daily. This particular scholarship 
is given to freshmen, sophomores 
and juniors at The Daily who 
have constructively contributed 
to the paper. It was created in 
memorial of Wendy Owen, a 
Daily staff member from 1949 to 
1951. As one of the few freshmen 
at the Scholarship Celebration, as 
well as one of the only students of 
color, it was really empowering 
to receive a Daily scholarship.

The whole celebration was 

extremely moving — listening to 
various Michigan Daily alumni 
and donors speak upon their 
experiences, 
memories 
and 

lessons learned at the newspaper. 
It was also really inspiring to 
see all of my peers who also 
received scholarships and to hear 
about all of the amazing things 
they’ve done at The Daily and the 

ways they’ve managed to keep 
journalism in their lives despite 
their various other academic 
endeavors.

The whole time I was at the 

celebration, though, the one 
thing that kept occurring to me 
was how little representation 
of people of color there was. 
Throughout 
my 
semester 
at 

The Daily, I was quickly able 
to observe how little racial 
diversity 
there 
was 
outside 

Michigan in Color. Though it 
was disheartening at first, I was 
able to forget about it because 
of the strong and supportive 
community I adopted through 
Michigan in Color.

But when I was at the 

Scholarship Celebration, I was 
able to see not only is the current 
makeup of The Daily largely 
white, but also was the makeup 
of previous Daily staffs — it was 
even more so than it is today. 
Almost all of the donors and 
alumni who came to speak were 
white, which made me realize 

even though The Daily has made 
positive steps in becoming a 
more diverse work environment 
as well as newspaper, it still 
has a long way to go. In The 
Michigan Daily, I often feel as if 
MiC is thought as a solution to 
the newspaper’s lack of diversity, 
but it’s more of just a bandage to 
cover up a bigger problem.

In an ideal world, The Daily 

shouldn’t need a “people of 
color” 
section. 
The 
Daily 

would be diverse enough that 
people of color could feel heard 
without having to look to only 
one section. I know that making 
The Daily I want to see will take 
baby steps, but I’m just hoping 
that someday The Daily is able to 
have the Scholarship Celebration 
and have just as many successful 
people of color alumni as there 
are white people who come back 
to talk about their experiences 
at The Daily and how they were 
able to take those experiences 
into the world.

Dear Me

LUCAS DEAN | COLUMN

JULIA COHN | COLUMN

C

oming 
to 
college, 
everyone 
echoed 
a 
similar 
mantra: 
“Cherish every moment, you 
only have one freshman year.” 
In the weeks before I finally left 
for Ann Arbor, I was wrought 
with anxiety and apprehension 
by the thought of going to 
college and leaving everything 
I knew behind. After unpacking 
my dorm room and hugging my 
parents goodbye, I knew, very 
rationally, that I was turning a 
new page in my life. Adulting, 
growing up, maturing, however 
you want to frame it. I was 
heading down a new path in my 
life.
With two weeks of the 
school year remaining, I get 
a little choked up every time 
I think about leaving the 
University of Michigan, a place 
that has truly become my new 
home. Looking back at my 
first few weeks to my last, the 
contrast is humorous. I want to 
pay homage to the parts of my 
freshman year at the University 
that made it so special.
My first few weeks of class, I 
had to use the Google Maps app 
to get from building to building. 
Being 
both 
directionally 
challenged and in a whole new 
environment is quite possibly 
the worst combination. Sadly, 
Maps wasn’t able to lead me 
to shortcuts, no matter how 
advanced the newest update 
may appear.
First 
semester, 
I 
had 
to walk from South Quad 
Resident Hall to the School 
of Public Health three times 
a week. For those of you who 
are geographically savvy, this 

is typically a 15-minute walk, 
but for the first three weeks 
of classes, it took me almost 
exactly 20 minutes to get to 
class. Maps was like my baby 
blanket, and I was too scared 
to go in any other direction 
other than where Siri directed 
me. Eventually, when heading 
to class with a friend one 
day, she looked at me wildly 
when I told her I had never 
cut through the Diag. Like, 
literally, I had never walked 
through the Diag to get to 
class. Finally being able to 
understand the intersecting 
paths around the emblematic 
‘M’ on the Diag was a life-

changing experience.
One fundamental part of the 
University’s character is the 
people that you meet here. I 
know, not everyone is great; it’s 
not a perfect place. But coming 
to this school, I never could 
have fathomed what it was like 
to be surrounded by so many 
smart, passionate and engaging 
students. There’s a competitive 
spirit to the University that 
challenges each student to 
become the best they can be. 
And believe me, there were, 

are and will be so many times 
when I will sigh in frustration 
believing that I am the dumbest 
person on campus. But having 
the opportunity to learn in 
an 
academically 
rigorous 
environment surrounded by 
peers who foster ambition and 
achievement is an unparalleled 
experience. No matter how 
hard the classes may seem, 
your 
classmates, 
professors 
and the campus environment 
are teaching students to grow 
and achieve more than they 
have believed.
Another fundamental part 
is the school spirit and our 
glorious game days. To be 
completely transparent, I am 
not a football person, but I love 
U-M game days with all of my 
heart. There is something so 
incredible 
about 
thousands 
of students, dressed in maize 
and blue, singing “Hail to the 
Victors” and willing a win 
out of our team. Win or lose, 
there is always unprecedented 
pride toward our team and our 
school. The student body feels 
as one unit, united by the spirit 
of the University of Michigan.
To the future Wolverines: 
Don’t take your freshman year 
for granted. Of course, it will 
be hard, and the University 
won’t feel like home with the 
snap of your fingers. But hold 
tight to the little moments, 
cut through the Diag and 
sing “Hail to the Victors” like 
it’s the last game day of your 
senior year.

G

raduating 
high 
school, I thought 
college would be a 
simple continuation of what I 
had been doing, but, you know, 
different. That wasn’t right 
at all; well, for the most part, 
anyways. My first semester was 
through the Summer Bridge 
Scholars Program and in a way 
it was like high school. We had 
predetermined classes at set 
times and we all got to know 
each other pretty well. Classes 
started at 8:30 every morning 
and there were two lunch 
periods. We were all done by 
4:30 p.m. and after classes 
we would meet up to play 
basketball, bet on video games 
or maybe watch a movie. Kind 
of like high school but, you 
know, different.
As I conclude my second year 
at the University of Michigan, I 
would like to reflect back on my 
time here, what has led me up to 
this point and what I wish I had 
done differently (thanks for the 
idea, Writing 350). If I could write 
a letter to my high school self, 
reminiscing on how I screwed 
up or the times I didn’t know 
any better, it would probably 
start with something along the 
lines of “Dear Me, you have no 
clue what you’re getting into,” or 
maybe more like “Dear Dumbass, 
please try harder,” or possibly 
even “Dear Idiot, if you don’t put 
110 percent effort into the coming 
months you are absolutely going 
to regret it.” After that first 
summer, I was overconfident, 
unprepared and just straight-up 
not ready for college.
Flash 
forward 
to 
fall 
semester freshman year and 
I actually had to pick my own 
classes (which I had never done 
before) and basically decide 
what I wanted to do with the 
rest of my life. Or so I thought. 
Ambitious as ever, I signed 
up for the earliest class times 
and, as a hopeful Engineering 
transfer, thought it would be a 
splendid idea to take all the core 
classes at once (Engineering 

100, Chemistry and Calculus). 
To top it off, I also took the 
LSA language requirement as 
I was still an LSA student and 
had not yet been accepted into 
the College of Engineering. I 
scheduled my classes back-to-
back-to-back-to-back, figuring 
I would just get them all out 
of the way, do homework for a 
little bit afterward and hang 
out for the rest of the day. 
Spoiler alert: that is not how 
college works.

I 
wish 
someone 
would 
have given me a reality check 
about what college was really 
like. Being a first-generation 
student, I wasn’t able to consult 
my parents in regard to how I 
was supposed to go about the 
whole college thing. I didn’t 
have many friends in college 
either, and I was afraid to ask 
those who were. In high school, 
I never thought very highly 
of those who dropped out of 
college, but I wish I had taken 
the time to ask why they did. 
After that fall semester I was 
seriously considering taking 
some time off myself. After that, 
I was a little more sympathetic 
to those who did decide to take 
a break from school. College 
sucked, man.
I have now been able to 
settle into college and I feel 
much more confident in my 
ability to manage the work 
involved, but if it hadn’t been 
for the high expectations of 
my family and friends, I might 
be flipping burgers for a living 
right now. I thought I was 

alone in my situation, but I later 
found out that this was not the 
case. In fact, according to the 
First Generation Foundation, 
“Nationally, 
89 
percent 
of 
low-income 
first-generation 
students leave college within 
six years without a degree” 
and, “More than a quarter leave 
after their first year.” Feeling 
unable to finish college has 
become a pretty significant 
problem facing first-generation 
students and, for me personally, 
it was due to the lack of 
preparation for college. I guess 
it would seem I managed to 
dodge a pretty large bullet.
If I could write a letter to 
myself, knowing what I know 
now, it would probably look 
something like this:
Dear idiot, dumbass me,
First and foremost, you are 
done with high school. It’s over. 
Please don’t go out partying 
if you have homework to do. 
Yes, even if it’s the weekend 
and all your friends are going. 
Stop procrastinating and do 
not prioritize a social life 
over school because you are 
really going to kill my GPA, 
dude. 
Second, 
please 
take 
a 
more 
manageable 
course 
load, especially in your first 
semester, because you will 
have me considering dropping 
out, for goodness sake. And 
last, but definitely not least, 
sit down and take some time 
to think about your future. 
Plan out what classes you 
need to take and how you are 
going to go about taking them. 
Talk to an advisor if you need 
to (just do it, man) — they are 
way smarter than you. Oh, and 
that calendar/schedule thing 
that you thought you were too 
good for? Well use it, idiot: it’s 
so much more helpful than you 
know.
Sincerely,
You, on a come up.

An homage to freshman year

ALI SAFAWI | COLUMN

An open letter to CSG
D

ear 
Central 
Student 
Government leaders,
As you take your new 
seats as representatives of our 
campus community, I would first 
like to congratulate you on your 
election and to wish you the best. 
I hope that you are able to meet 
the numerous challenges, both 
old and new, with practicality 
and grace. I am sure the new CSG 
administration 
and 
assembly 
will make positive change. With 
that being said, allow me to offer 
my suggestions as to how CSG 
can address the growing mental 
health crisis on our campus.
All of you ran with parties 
whose platforms and campaigns 
dedicated significant time to 
mental 
health. 
For 
instance, 
MVision, 
whose 
candidates 
won the presidency and vice 
presidency, as well as a plurality 
of assembly seats, ran a campaign 
focused 
on 
recognizing 
the 
concerns of students with mental 
health conditions as well as 
other “invisible identities.” Both 
MVision and the runner-up party 
MomentUM also endorsed a goal 
of reducing the student to mental 
health professional ratio from 
1,200 -to-1 to 1,000-to-1. I am 
assured that you all believe that it 
is a serious issue. Yet, realizing an 
issue’s seriousness is only the first 
step in taking concrete actions.
There are three interrelated 
issues I would like to see CSG take 
on: One, access to mental health 
care; two, substance abuse; and 
three, sources of chronic stress.
While hiring more mental 
health providers and opening a 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological 
Services center on North Campus 
are both worthy goals, more needs 
to be done to ensure equitable 
access to care on our campus. 
First, 
the 
current 
mental 
health system, focused on CAPS 
and the University Health Service, 
requires students to travel to 
receive care. This may not seem 
like a significant issue for routine 
care, such as biweekly counseling 
sessions, but forcing students to 
travel to seek care at the Union 
or UHS could cause issues in 
situations of trauma and crisis. 
Let’s take a hypothetical but all 
too probable situation of a student 
in a dorm — say, Couzens —who 
is in the middle of an emotional 
crisis. Yes, residence advisers 
are given basic training in crisis 
management, but that may not be 
enough. Now imagine having the 
student in crisis, who could really 
benefit from a face-to-face session 
with a psychologist or social 
worker, walk to CAPS. Add to that 

the potential for bad weather or 
the fact that emotional crises do 
not solely occur during the open 
hours of CAPS and you end up 
with a detrimental situation for 
the student already in a bad place.
I would ask CSG to work with 
the Residence Halls Association, 
University Housing and CAPS to 
assign mental health professionals 
to each dorm to make it easier 
for students on campus to access 
care. While many students live off 
campus, the University has more 
power to implement initiatives in 
the dorms. We already have the 
staff for this change, we just need 
to put them in new offices. I realize 
that the logistics of such a policy are 
more complex than I have laid out, 
but I believe such a change, which 
would decentralize the mental 
health system on campus, is both 
achievable and worth the effort.
Second, CSG can play an 
important role in addressing 
substance 
abuse 
on 
campus, 
especially related to prescription 
drugs. I have noticed almost all 
of the substance abuse education 
we get as University students is on 
alcohol. While attention to alcohol 
abuse is merited — 20 percent of 
college students suffer from it — 
there are other forms of substance 
abuse on campus that pose a 
danger to students.

Since the release of Netflix 
documentary “Take Your Pills,” 
there has been a new focus on the 
nonprescription use of central 
nervous 
system 
stimulants 
such as Adderall and Ritalin by 
college students. A survey by 
The Michigan Daily found 24 
percent of University students 
use Adderall, whereas only 8.95 
percent have a prescription for it. 
Ignoring for now the academic 
consequences of nonprescription 
Adderall use, there is a real mental 
health danger to students. For 
instance, there are documented 
cases of Adderall abuse driving 
students to suicide.
Another prescription drug, 
Xanax, also causes me concern. 
According to the most recent 
data from the Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention, Xanax 
is the fourth leading cause of 
drug overdose deaths in the 
U.S. Per an investigation by the 
CUIndependent, students at the 
University of Colorado Boulder, 
a 
similarly 
prestigious 
state 
university, use Xanax often in 
combination with alcohol to deal 
with anxiety and panic attacks, 
even without a prescription. While 
I am not aware of any studies on 
the prevalence of nonprescription 
Xanax use on campus, I suspect it 
would be comparable to Adderall.
While prescription drugs like 
oxycodone carry a stigma and sense 
of danger owing to the opioid crisis, 
I feel the same cannot be said about 
Adderall and Xanax. I encourage 
CSG to work with the University on 
a public health education campaign 
about the dangers of using these 
drugs 
without 
a 
clinician’s 
supervision and about campus 
resources for those looking to break 
their addiction.
Third, the University must 
enter a culture shift to reduce the 
dog-eat-dog academic environment 
that breeds so much stress in 
students. Academic stress is one 
reason why students turn to 
Adderall and Xanax. I remember 
nearly pulling my hair out with 
worry over my first organic 
chemistry exam. This should not be 
happening. While a culture shift 
will take longer than one CSG 
term, it is critical that we begin 
a dialogue on how our academic 
environment is directly affecting 
mental health in negative ways.
Another stressor that needs 
attention is the recurrent racist 
incidents on campus. It is not 
enough to declare racism or other 
prejudice has no place on this 
campus. Last year, students of color 
found strong allies in former CSG 
President Anushka Sarkar and 
Vice President Nadine Jawad. I 
hope current CSG President Daniel 
Greene and Vice President Izzy 
Baer will continue in that mold.
Let’s prevent mental health 
problems from developing in the 
first place.
Granted, 
there 
are 
many 
serious issues on our campus, 
however, mental health is one 
that touches the lives of all 
students one way or another. I will 
continue to advocate for better 
mental health services on campus 
and look forward to having allies 
in CSG.
Warmest regards,
Ali Safawi

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Monday, April 16, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

For lovers of Japanese anime, 

the most common debate is 
subbed versus dubbed, referring 
to using subtitles or English-
speaking voice actors to voice 
over 
the 
original 
Japanese 

dialogue. 
Proponents 
of 

“subbed” argue this preserves 
the 
intended 
language 
and 

delivery of the actors, as well as 
prevents the distracting nature 
of 
most 
“dubbed” 
versions. 

Wes Anderson, writer-director 
of the new stop-motion film 
“Isle of Dogs,” falls into the 
category of pro-subbed, telling 
Entertainment Weekly, “I don’t 
like to watch Japanese movies 
that are dubbed into English. I 
like the performances of actors 
in Japanese. It’s interesting to 
me, and it’s a very beautiful, 
complex language.” Ironically, 
no part of Anderson’s statement 
applies to his approach to “Isle 
of Dogs,” which follows a young 
boy in futuristic Japan trying to 
find his exiled dog.

Let’s break down Anderson’s 

explanation for how he sets 
up the dialogue in “Isle of 
Dogs.” The film begins with 
a disclaimer: The Japanese-
speaking actors speak only in 
Japanese and the dogs on Trash 
Island only in barks, translated 
into English. It’s a funny joke 
that devolves into something 
more sinister. A handful of 
scenes use subtitles, but for the 
most part Anderson places the 
Japanese-speaking 
characters 

in the background and a white 
interpreter — either Interpreter 
Nelson 
or 
foreign-exchange 

student Tracy Walker, portrayed 
respectively 
by 
Frances 

McDormand (“Three Billboards 
Outside Ebbing, Missouri”) and 
Greta Gerwig (“Frances Ha”) 
— in the foreground speaking 
in English. Anderson claims 
he dislikes dubbed Japanese 
movies, yet that is essentially 

what he has done with “Isle 
of Dogs,” albeit in a more 
cinematic, purposeful fashion. 
Most dubbed Japanese animes 
feel unpleasant, since adding 
voices to a scene constructed to 
time with the Japanese language 
comes across as an afterthought. 
However, Anderson goes to 
great lengths in a number of 
scenes to hand-draw footage 
of the Japanese characters and 
animate the English-speaking 
interpreters to accomplish his 
‘brilliant’ setup. His silencing 
of 
non-white 
characters 
is 

pre-planned, 
intentional 
and 

problematic.

For such a political movie, 

with 
obvious 
side-jabs 
at 

immigration 
policies, 
“Isle 

of Dogs” should not silence 
the 
non-white 
characters, 

particularly Asians who have 
the 
most 
underwhelming 

voice as a collective ethnic 
group 
in 
American 
politics 

and on-screen. According to a 
report from the Media, Diversity 
and Social Change Initiative 
at the University of Southern 
California, Asian directors lead 
just 3.4 percent of major studio 
films. The same study found 
Asians land only 5.1 percent 
of speaking or named parts in 
film, TV or on digital platforms, 
with no Asians in 50 percent 
of all projects and around one 
percent featuring an Asian lead. 
Furthermore, Asians are often 
painted as the model minority 
who keep their heads down and 
do as they are told.

Anderson 
perpetuates 
the 

model minority myth, along 
with other stereotypes about 
Japanese 
culture 
like 
sumo 

wrestling and sushi, in his 
new film. The native Japanese 
characters 
are 
completely 

silenced and fit the passive, 
submissive role America wants 
Asians to occupy. In fact, despite 
Atari Kobayashi, a 12-year-old 
Japanese boy and adopted son 
of the Mayor of the fictitious city 
Megasaki, marketed as the main 
character, Anderson surrounds 

him 
with 
non-Japanese-

speaking 
dogs, 
essentially 

making Atari mute. Instead, a 
white foreign-exchange student 
leads the revolution and pro-
dog rebellion, motivating the 
passive 
Japanese 
students 

to 
help 
her 
cause 
against 

the passive Japanese adults. 
Anderson wants “Isle of Dogs” 
to serve as a sign of appreciation 
towards Japanese culture, but he 
champions their passivity as a 
reason to sideline and silence the 
Japanese characters.

In addition to silencing Asian 

roles, 
Anderson 
also 
treats 

the culture as a backdrop. His 
comment 
to 
Entertainment 

Weekly about the beauty of the 
Japanese language illuminates 
the problem with his portrayal 
of Japan in “Isle of Dogs” — it’s 
fetishy. Western cinema and 
crowds have always had an 
unflattering 
over-fascination 

with all things (stereotypically) 
Asian — be it the movie “Karate 
Kid,” Asian women or anime 
in general. This approach to 
Asian 
culture 
is 
magnified 

prominently in “Isle of Dogs” 
through Anderson’s aesthetic. 
All of Anderson’s films have a 
distinct and stunning mise-en-
scene. However, in “Isle of Dogs,” 
his greatest gift turns into an 
exploitation of an entire culture 
simply to satisfy his artistic eye. 
Evidently, Anderson chose to set 
his film in Japan out of a love 
for how it looks, not its essence. 
The 
people, 
their 
cultural 

traditions and historic tragedies 
merge 
with 
the 
landscape, 

becoming props and puppets in 
Anderson’s quest for aesthetic 
pleasure. Although he touches 
on different parts of Japanese 
culture, Anderson’s exploration 
is so shallow that the film could 
easily have taken place instead in 
some rural town in Canada and 
barely skipped a beat. So, why set 
it in Japan? Anderson goes on to 
say with Entertainment Weekly, 
“The movie is a fantasy … a 
reimagining of Japan through 
my experience.” There we go, it’s 

a “fantasy,” a fetishized version 
of Japan for aesthetic purposes.

All writers appropriate stories. 

A white man making a film 
about Japan is less than ideal, 
but that’s why “Isle of Dogs” 
should more aptly be called 
cultural fetishization. This is 
my term for artists who want to 
appreciate another culture, but 
end up tone-deaf and treating 
their subject matter as exotic 
or secondary to the story for 
aesthetic as well as educational 
reasons. This mindset shows 
in an interview that Bryan 
Cranston, who voices the dog 
Chief in “Isle of Dogs,” had with 
The 
Independent. 
Cranston 

argued, in support of Anderson 
and against the idea that the film 
is cultural appropriation, “Art 
should in some cases be very 
relatable … ‘I know this guy, I 
like him, I know where he lives, 
I’m very familiar,’ and then there 
are other art forms that should 
introduce you to something 
you are not familiar with … and 
‘Isle of Dogs’ has that sense of 
the culture, the language, the 
drumming. It is an introduction 
to something you’re not familiar 
with and it adds to the fabric of 
the storytelling.” 

In other words, “Isle of 

Dogs” is a white man’s attempt 
to explain Japanese people to 
a white audience. This film 
waves the flag of diversity as a 
cover-up for the fact that it is 
meant to educate the dominant 
(white) culture, not pay homage 
to Japan. If the purpose of a 
film is to ogle at the ‘other,’ the 
unfamiliar, then at least put 
us, the supposed ‘other,’ in the 
spotlight — giving jobs and a 
voice to the people being put on 
display. The insult is only greater 
when we are simultaneously 
treated like animals at the zoo 
and ignored. In the case of “Isle 
of Dogs,” the appropriation is 
not the biggest problem, but 
rather the fetishization of a 
whole culture for the purpose of 
aesthetics, while this culture is 
not even the center of attention.

‘Isle of Dogs,’ cultural fetishization 
and the Asian American experience

Matt & Kim

Royal Oak Music 

Theater

April 18

$30

I saw Matt and Kim for the 

first time when I was 15 years 
old. My parents dropped me and 
two friends at the show in Detroit 
— untrusting of my older friend 
who offered to take me — before 
heading to Greektown Casino. 
Prior to that day, I had never been 
to a standing room 
show, having only 
tagged 
along 
to 

concerts with my 
family to see Zac 
Brown 
Band 
or 

Kenny 
Chesney 

perform at arenas. 
Over the years, I’ve 
seen Matt and Kim 
play progressively 
larger stages in front of bigger and 
bigger crowds, each time going 
toe-to-toe with their growing fan 
base’s enthusiasm. Despite the 
changes that the passing years 
have brought for the duo, they’ve 
managed to hold onto a unique 
sense of bliss and belonging that 
spills into their crowds and floods 
the bodies of everyone dancing 
and singing along. Almost six years 
after that fateful day in Detroit, I 
still owe its magnetic atmosphere 
for most of my love for live music to 
this very day.

In an interview with The 

Daily, keyboardist / vocalist Matt 
Johnson (who composes one half 
of the duo alongside drummer/
vocalist Kim Schifino) discusses 
the signature energy of a Matt and 
Kim show, his relationship with 
Kim and their forthcoming album 
Almost Everyday, which is set to 
release on May 4.

Discussing 
his 
experiences 

and priorities as the musician on 
the stage, Johnson highlights the 
importance of crowd interaction 
at their shows, which produces 
incredibly spirited results.

“A huge thing for us for years, 

as we grew and got bigger — 
the rooms got bigger, festivals, 
whatever — it was how to keep it 
all about everybody in the room, 
not just the two people on stage,” 
Johnson said. “Like, when we 
first started out we were playing 
in little warehouses in Brooklyn 
where we’d be on the floor with 
everyone else, and it was just this 
party/vibe energy: we’re all doing 
this together.”

While I’ve never seen them play 

on the floor of a warehouse, I can 
attest to “this party/vibe energy” 
of their shows. The attendees 
never stop moving, crowd surfers 
bask in an unnamed glory atop the 
hands in the crowd, while people 
jump and sing to every song. 
Johnson’s voice is welcoming in 
tone, inviting the fans to sing along 
with a budding happiness growing 
up and outward with every passing 
minute.

Supplementing the accessibility 

of their indie pop, Matt and 
Kim know how to take their 
performance to the next level 
through crowd interaction. They 
blast confetti, toss balloons and 
literally dance on top of the crowd 
(while encouraging their fans to do 
the same).

“It’s like breaking that wall 

in the front. Just trying to get 
everyone to dance and jump 
around, that energy is what makes 
the show,” Johnson said.

Beyond 
their 
crowd 

interactions, 
Johnson 
also 

reflected on the importance of his 
relationship with Schifino. Both 

share a confident, breezy charisma 
that is intensified by their dynamic, 
playful jokes and back-and-forth 
banter — for example, Schifino 
joked about Johnson’s enjoyment 
of “pegging” at Mo Pop in 2017.

“I assume people connect to 

seeing two people who really do 
love each other on stage — that 
could go for any sort of friendship 
to any escalation … I’ve seen bands 
that have a tough time getting 
along, and I think sometimes that 

energy comes on 
the stage,” Johnson 
explained.

Johnson 
also 

elaborated on their 
carefree attitude in 
performance 
that 

adds to this energy: 
“We make so many 
mistakes, 
we’re 

imperfect, we’re no 

sort of virtuoso instrumentalists, 
but there’s an energy we try to 
create that we get wrapped up in, 
and I think that the audience gets 
wrapped up in it, too.”

We then discussed Matt and 

Kim’s upcoming release Almost 
Everyday, where the duo makes 
a 
noticeable 
jump 
towards 

electro-pop without abandoning 
the signature simplicity of their 
melodies. Yet, Johnson noted that 
the state of the world around them 
had a much larger influence in 
the writing of their new album in 
comparison to their past work.

“It came from somewhat of 

a different place than all of the 
albums that preceded it. Mostly 
because it was about getting 
some stuff off our chest and some 
feelings we were having on a year 
that was tough. Because Kim was 
recovering from surgery, and just 
out in the political climate it was 
so difficult and bad things were 
happening,” Johnson said. “You 
know, a lot more of our albums, 
lyrically, came from a different 
perspective, a more everyday 
perspective. This ended up a lot 
more personal, these sort of realer 
things we were going through.”

This idea threads through the 

album, 
rationalizing 
internally 

what is happening externally. 
First single “Forever” explores the 
difficulties of living in a “world 
of shit,” while “All In My Head” 
features only a few cries of the title 
over waves of crashing cymbals 
and interjected horns, almost like 
a reflection on the chaotically 
fluctuating nature of living in 
today’s world. The duo asks “How 
do you wake from a nightmare?” 
on final track “Where Do We Go 
From Here?” while perforating 
this uncertainty with quips of 
positivity in the song’s last minute.

The unifying force of Matt 

and Kim’s music is the pursuit 
of happiness, and this is far from 
abandoned on Almost Everyday; 
speaking to their decision on the 
title, Johnson explained: “It just 
seemed like we were just dealing 
with more tough shit, more 
tough news and all of that ‘almost 
everyday.’ They’re just like us, 
working through the difficulties 
of everyday life that might seem 
a little more oppressive and 
omnipresent in 2018, but they 
certainly haven’t let that negativity 
warp the cheeriness of their music.

On Apr. 19, Matt and Kim will 

be performing at Royal Oak Music 
Theater, undoubtedly ready to 
ignite one hell of a fire under the 
feet of the crowd and hopefully 
with a few new tricks up their 
sleeve from Almost Everyday. 
Tickets for the event can be 
purchased here.

Making 
art 
— 
with 
all 

its 
intentions, 
elements 
of 

unpredictability and rewards 
— should be meaningful from 
start to finish. Or, at least, so is 
the case for Ohio native Allison 
Hylant. Hylant, who graduated 
from the University with a BFA 
in Fine Art in 2012, decided to 
dedicate her professional self 
to creating textile products 
that are eco-friendly, hand-
crafted and entirely inimitable.

“I come from a long line 

(of artists, and) ... although 
none 
have 
pursued 
art 

professionally, being creative 
was something that was always 
encouraged 
in 
my 
family,” 

Hylant wrote in an email 
interview with The Daily. “My 
father has a minor in ceramics 
and my grandmother was a 
painter. I started taking art 
classes at age three. I always 
thought I would probably study 
Art History in college, but I had 
some amazing teachers and 
advisors in high school (that) 
really encouraged me (to) apply 
to studio art programs.”

Dale & Blue, her Detroit-

based 
business 
and 
design 

studio, 
launched 
in 
2016. 

Currently, Dale & Blue offers 
a 
selection 
of 
indigo-dyed 

pillows and home goods; all of 
which, of course, are handmade 

in small batches. Though a few 
years out of art school, Hylant 
still finds joy in her process.

“The first time I learned 

about shibori dyeing, I was a 
freshman in college. Almost 
10 years ago,” she wrote. “I 
can’t even tell you how many 
hundreds of yards of fabric 

I have dyed in that time, but 
there is a magic to it every time. 
No matter how many times you 
prepare fabric, fold it, bind it, 
wrap it, block it into place, you 
never really know what the 
piece will look like until you 
pull it from the dye bath.”

Hylant was living in Boston 

working 
as 
the 
in-house 

seamstress 
for 
Marimekko 

after pursuing an additional 
degree, a post-baccalaureate 
year at the School of the 
Museum of Fine Arts, when she 
founded the LLC.

“(Marimekko) proved to be 

the perfect training ground 
to launch a business,” Hylant 
wrote. “After several years 
of working, I realized I had 
gone as far as I could with 
the company. I wanted a new 
challenge, to be working with 
my own designs, making my 
own decisions. I kept working 
at Marimekko, while I was 
figuring out the particulars of 
the company.”

One such particular was 

the company’s name — Hylant 
wanted something personal, 
but something versatile enough 
to work as the company grew 
and 
changed. 
Eventually 

settling on Dale & Blue, Hylant 
opted 
for 
family 
names. 

Ironically enough, she didn’t 
know she would be working 
with Indigo when settling on 
the name.

“Dale & Blue were the names 

of my two grandfathers,” she 
wrote. “Neither are still alive 
today, so I thought it was a great 
tribute to them. I was very 
close with my Grandpa Dale; 
he lost his battle with cancer 
when I was a senior in high 
school. And (my) Grandpa Blue 
passed away a year before I was 
born. His real name is Robert, 
but he was such a big Michigan 

Alum Allison Hylant on

CARLY SNIDER

COURTESY OF ALLISON HYLANT

LOCAL SPOTLIGHT

fan everyone called him Blue. 
(I guess I was destined to be 
a Wolverine.) The company 
name actually has nothing 
to do with the color blue, the 
signature color of the brand … 
But the name has proved to be 
extremely serendipitous.”

Behind the name is a strong 

philosophy. Having worked in 
a more traditional, high-end 
environment as well as having 
spent time interning with a 
fair trade company, Hylant is 
committed to bringing those 
two worlds, though often at 
odds, together. Simply put: 
people over things.

“We love things; it’s why we 

make them, and buy them,” 
she wrote. “But that should 
never come at the expense of 
the people who make them 
or the environment … At the 
forefront of my practice is 
the belief that where the raw 
materials are sourced from is 
just as important as the life the 
products have once they leave 
the studio.”

To do this, Hylant chooses 

U.S.-based 
manufacturers 

whenever possible — both to 
promote national employment 

and to reduce Dale & Blue’s 
carbon footprint. She wants her 
customers to be proud to own 
her products, because of their 
beauty and their backstory. 
Knowing that the standards 
she sets for herself are high and 
often cumbersome, Hylant sees 
the benefit to society as more 
important than her potential 
personal gain.

This 
kind 
of 
personal 

dedication to her artistic and 
economic output is inspiring 
and entirely at home in Detroit’s 
growing entrepreneurial spirit. 
Hylant is part of Ponyride 
studios, a nonprofit with a large 
studio space on Vermont Street. 
Ponyride, like Dale & Blue, is 
invested in promoting positive 
social output and growth.

“In Detroit you have this 

great sense of all things being 
possible, people here aren’t 
afraid to try new things (or 
re-invent old ones) and some 
of them are really working!” 
Hylant wrote. “It is an exciting 
time in Detroit … Ponyride has 
provided me with a network of 
other like-minded businesses 
and resources to help navigate 
what can be a very stressful 

process.”

Despite the trials of getting 

a business off the ground — 
especially one that holds so 
tightly to its goals of changing 
an often problematic industry 
— Hylant is hopeful and excited 
for the future of Dale & Blue. 
She hopes to launch print-
screened fabrics by the yard, 
and to collaborate with another 
artist to create fine art prints 
and original paintings. Behind 
all the social goals, there is 
still the art. The two elements 
play off each other, challenging 
Hylant to create in a way that is 
sustainable and allowing eco-
friendly practices to be integral 
to her work.

“I would love to see Dale & 

Blue expand to be a cohesive 
lifestyle brand,” she wrote. 
“But really at the end of the day, 
it is less about what we make 
and more about how we make 
these products and the impact 
we have on the people who 
make them … As a company 
and a businesswoman I am still 
finding my footing, it’s a long 
process, but I am really excited 
for all the things that could be 
next.”

On 
the 
afternoon 
of 

Saturday, Apr. 21, a diverse 
variety 
of 
student 
models 

will take to the sidewalks of 
downtown Ann Arbor as part 
of a Guerrilla Fashion Show 
hosted by fashion publication 
ROGUE and Ann Arbor-based 
organization Radfun.

“(The goal of the show is) 

to celebrate and center bodies 
of color, big bodies, queer 
bodies, trans bodies — bodies 
that are not often given a place 
within fashion — and advocate 
for the issues that come with 
those 
communities,” 
wrote 

Kai Mason, LSA junior and 
founder 
of 
ROGUE. 
“My 

favorite description of the 
fashion show as yet has been 
‘at once a protest, a party and a 
celebration.’”

According to LSA senior and 

Radfun co-organizer Darian 
Razdar, 
onlookers 
should 

expect to see plenty of flashy 
costumes, along with models 
in self-styled outfits. Some 
garments will be designed 
specifically for the show. They 
should also expect the chants 
and noise levels characteristic 
of social demonstrations.

“I’m really excited because 

this Guerrilla Fashion Show is 
going to be a way of blending 
art and activism, and allowing 
people who aren’t centered 
in our pop culture. We’re 
centering them in this fashion 
show,” Razdar said. “We’re 
focused on giving marginalized 
people space, and the idea of a 
guerrilla fashion show is to 

command space in a way that 
isn’t sanctioned by institutions 
or by politics.”

In 
Mason’s 
eyes, 
the 

Guerrilla Fashion Show will 
bring a new dimension to both 
fashion and activism in Ann 
Arbor.

“It’s something I’ve never 

seen done before at Michigan,” 
she wrote, “and I’m so excited 
to have a chance to question 
the status quo, the unspoken 
pressures of conformity and 
complacency that are imposed 
on us in both this institution 
and beyond, through fashion.”

Just months after Michigan fired Tommy 

Amaker and hired some coach from West Virginia 

in April of 2007, the men’s basketball team opened 

offseason workouts. It was a directionless program, 

desperate for national relevance and one — just one 

— NCAA Tournament berth.

It was day one of the John Beilein era. And, little 

did anyone know, day one of perhaps the greatest 

sustained period of success in Michigan basketball 

history.

At the beginning of the workout, then-assistant 

coach John Mahoney barged into the weight room, 

hooting and hollering.

“We’re trying to win a motherf-ing national 

championship,” he yelped. “And that’s why we’re 

here.”

Guard Jevohn Shepherd gave his teammate 

Anthony Wright a glance. Wright still recalls what 

Shepherd said next.

“Man, this guy has to calm down.”

***

John Beilein was plenty calm.

He looked down, then at the clock, then back 

up. He took five steps to his right and shook Jay 

Wright’s hand with a smile, walking off the court 

40 minutes short of immortality once again.

For the second time in six seasons, he and his 

team had fallen one game shy of fulfilling that brash 

weight room proclamation 10 years ago. Maybe it’ll 

happen one day. Maybe not.

But there’s a pit that still lingers in fans’ stomachs, 

a laundry list of “what-ifs” that will live forever. It’s 

an emotion bred from a program-wide attitude 

change, cultivated through day-to-day, incremental 

improvement. There’s one guy responsible for that. 

That same coach from West Virginia has now 

qualified for the NCAA Tournament seven times 

in the last eight seasons, made the Elite Eight three 

times and the championship game twice. His 

resume vaults him alongside the premier coaches 

in college basketball; he directs a program that is 

now a model of consistency.

It’s not a change that happened overnight or 

without its fair share of trial and error.

But to fully understand the Beilein-led 

transformation, take a dive into a desperate 

timeout, a huddle at the Big Ten Tournament in 

2009. 

A glimpse into a fledgling program learning 

what it really takes to win.

***

He had to call timeout to get something out in 

the open. After all, a potential NCAA Tournament 

bid for the first time in 10 years — and the entire 

trajectory of the program — hung in the balance.

It was the second round of the Big Ten 

Tournament, and Beilein’s squad trailed Illinois by 

20 late in the second half. Beilein and his team had 

all but conceded hope of a comeback.

If this team — sitting at .500 in conference play 

— came short of the NCAA Tournament, murmurs 

asking for his job would only amplify. It would’ve 

been 11 years and counting without a tournament 

bid, three under Beilein. In a candid moment, he 

warned his team of what a blowout loss might 

mean. For the team. For the school. For him.

“Beilein called timeout just to say, ‘Look the 

committee is watching this game,’” Wright, a 

Michigan forward from 2006-10, recalled. “‘If we 

get blown out this could hurt us.’ He literally said 

that during the timeout. He said, ‘We’ve got to get 

this as close as possible.’ It wasn’t ‘win the game,’ 

just ‘keep it close.’”

The timeout was a blunt reality, a mark of 

tempered expectations. That coveted leap to 

prominence doesn’t come without putting one foot 

in front of the other, taking one small step after 

another.

Michigan trimmed its deficit, losing by a 

respectable 10 points. It would later be selected as 

a 10-seed in the NCAA Tournament, where it fell 

to the Blake Griffin-led Oklahoma Sooners in the 

second round. Still, there’s no way to see the 2008-

2009 season as anything other than an unmitigated 

success.

In the first season free of scholarship limitations 

due to the Ed Martin payment scandal, the 

Wolverines made the NCAA Tournament for the 

first time in 11 seasons.

Every tidal wave begins with a ripple. That 

rag-tag group in 2009 laid the foundation for what 

came next.

***

“Culture shift” is a phrase that gets thrown 

around in sports, when change wants to be 

sugarcoated with a smile. It can often be 

meaningless and exaggerated in its tone. There are 

countless examples of failed attempts at culture 

shifts in sports because culture, as it turns out, is 

hard to shift.

This isn’t one of those stories.

As with everything John Beilein does, this 

change took time, and it was a process. But the 

results have been on display for nine years now. 

The national runner-up Wolverines are a shining 

beacon of a college basketball program, and it’s easy 

to forget it hasn’t always been that way.

“When he first started recruiting me in 2007, 

the program … was obviously not in a good place,” 

said center Jordan Morgan, a member of the 

Wolverines from 2011-14. “At that point in my life, 

Michigan going to Final Fours and winning Big Ten 

Championships, it was a little bit hard to fathom at 

the time just because of where Michigan was at.”

At the start of Beilein’s tenure, “where Michigan 

was at” could only be classified as oblivion. It hadn’t 

made the NCAA Tournament since 1998, and at a 

school in the heart of the Lloyd Carr era in football, 

the basketball team toiled with mediocrity more 

than disaster.

Well removed from the Fab Five era, with the 

1989 national title a faint memory, Michigan had 

yet to turn a page on the court.

Final Fours? This team just wanted to make the 

damn tournament.

It was stuck with the only thing worse than 

failure: Irrelevance.

Hiring John Beilein, a little-known Jesuit coach 

with a measured attitude and a sunny disposition, 

did little to change that reputation overnight.

Internally, though, the overhaul began 

immediately.

“I’m not sure I really knew what ‘rebuild 

that program’ meant,” Morgan said. “But 

from the minute that I met him, he used to 

talk to me about rebuilding. Rebuilding 

a program. Building something special. 

Being a part of rebuilding that. And that 

was what made me want to go to Michigan 

in the first place.”

Before practices even began, Beilein 

and his staff instituted a number of 

tests — tests of skill and of athleticism — 

that each player needed to accomplish 

before he could even step on the 

practice court.

They ranged from conditioning 

requirements, like running a mile in 

5:30 or less, to skill-based measures, 

like making 50 threes in five 

minutes.

Couldn’t do it? No practice. No 

games. No exceptions.

Those tests still exist today, 

though they’ve evolved with 

more focus on skill than the mile 

run, for example. The best of 

the best can now peak at 70 or 

even 80 threes in that same 

timeframe.

“If you could do those 

tests, it didn’t necessarily 

mean you were gonna be a 

better basketball player. It 

was testing your mental 

toughness, I think,” 

said 
guard 
Zack 

Novak, a Michigan 

forward from 2008-

12. “He was coming in, 

saying, ‘I’m going to get 

you as tired as you can be, 

and you’re not allowed to 

practice until you show 

me that you can get 

through that and win 

these drills.’ ”

And 
once 
you 

made it into practice, 

each drill had a 

winner and a loser, 

with 
punishment 

doled out to the 

latter.

“You 
have 
to 

learn how to win,” 

Novak said. “That’s 

a real thing. Just 

the way that we 

competed in practice, 

every drill. … He just 

had us learning how 

to win, how to execute 

when the pressure was on.”

But learning how to win doesn’t automatically 

translate into winning.

The players struggled to grasp the complexity of 

an offense that has since come to be accepted as one 

of the most efficient in the country.

At the time, its genius was also its biggest flaw.

“There are so many plays, and there are always 

plays within the plays,” Wright said. “And there are 

always counters of the plays within the play that 

can change just by someone doing an action.”

Confused?

You wouldn’t be alone. Bewildered players asked 

questions that often took 30 minutes for Beilein to 

explain before his team could execute it all.

I’d give anything

I

’m the baby of the family — by 
a large margin. 

Janet 

is 40. Vinnie 
is 37. TJ is 34. 
Mike is 33. 
James is 29. 
And growing 
up, I wanted 
to be just like 
them. 

When I was 

eight years 
old, I asked 
my dad to buy 
me a soccer jersey — not Ronald-
inho’s, not Thierry Henry’s, not 
Wayne Rooney’s. No, I wanted a 
Rockville Centre Nitro jersey. That 
was James’ travel team. And when 
my dad asked me what number I 
wanted on the back, I told him 23. 
That was James’ number. 

Two years later, when I made 

my own travel team, it came time 
to pick my own number. I wasn’t 
allowed to choose anything below 
25, so I chose 31. Janet wore 13. I 
wanted to play like her. 

And two years after that, I start-

ed playing basketball. 

Mike decided I needed to learn 

how to shoot a proper jumpshot. 
So he took me out in the backyard 
one day and forced me to copy his 
jumper over and over and over 
again. 

Our hoop hung above our 

garage. I hit that garage more than 
I hit the rim. I went inside whin-
ing about how it was too hard, and 
then I copied his jumper every day 
after — or at least tried to. I was 
better at rebounding than shoot-
ing, to put it lightly. 

Even that skill, inadvertently, 

was the product of my siblings’ 
creation. 

About a year after trying to emu-

late that jumper, my mom woke 
me up for school. I showered, put 
on my St. Agnes uniform and went 
downstairs, only to see that the 
clock was 20 minutes ahead of my 
normal routine. 

My mom walked into the living 

room and told me to grab a bas-
ketball, put on my coat and come 

outside. I met my mom on the pave-
ment, and she told me to shoot. 

As soon as the ball left my fin-

gers, my mom was crouched down, 
backing me further and further 
away from the rim. I asked her 
what she was doing, and she told 
me she was sick of seeing me get 
outrebounded in rec league even 
though I was taller than all of my 
siblings. 

Then she took the ball, and told 

me we weren’t going to school until 
I boxed her out like TJ used to. 

As for Vin, well, baseball was his 

sport. I have no shame in admitting 
I might have set a record for Little 
League strikeouts. But one day he 
walked in the door and asked me 
how I was. I told him I was good, 
end of sentence. Then came the 
sarcasm that I’ve gotten used to 
— “I’m doing good too, thanks for 
asking.”

I was nine. I haven’t failed to ask 

someone how they’re doing since. 

I tell you all of this so that you 

can understand why my plan was 
never to end up in Ann Arbor. 

As I grew older, the admiration 

for my siblings materialized in 
different ways. As a junior in high 

school, it just so happened to mani-
fest itself in my college application 
process. 

Vinnie and TJ had gone to Cor-

nell, so I wanted to go there too. I 
told my guidance counselor I was 
applying there early decision. That 
wasn’t good enough for him, so he 
rattled off a list of colleges I should 
also plan on applying to. 

Eventually, he told me to con-

sider Michigan. 

I was incredulous. Michigan 

was a “sports school,” I told him. 
Then he showed me the average 
SAT score of admitted students, 
and I realized how wrong I was. 

I think Mr. Moss would laugh at 

me now. I never got into Cornell. I 
came to Michigan, and joined The 
Daily a month into my freshman 
year. I’ve been writing about a 
“sports school” ever since. 

***
Before I decided to come here, 

my dad and I ended up visiting Ann 
Arbor in the middle of my senior 
year. 

After our campus tour, he pulled 

the rental car out of what was a for-
eign parking structure and turned 
right on to what was a foreign 

street.

Coincidentially, as he stopped 

at the first intersection, I told 
him that maybe I could write 
for the business section of the 
school newspaper. It was a passing 
thought. 

Now I know there is no editorial 

business section at the Daily. Now 
I know that was the intersection of 
Maynard and East William. Now 
I know that if he drove straight, 
I would have seen 420 Maynard 
about seven months prior. 

But he turned left, and we 

watched the Michigan basketball 
team play in the Big Ten Tourna-
ment at Cantina. I never imagined 
covering that same tournament 
three years later or going to a bar to 
write about that same team a year 
after that, and I realize now why 
an 18-year-old with braces and his 
dad were getting funny looks. 

When I got home, I was still 

apprehensive about going to col-
lege so far away from New York. 
My siblings told me to go, to enjoy 
a big-university experience that 
they had never had. I put off the 
decision as long as possible, then 
told my dad on the drive back from 

visiting SUNY Binghamton that I 
was going to Michigan. 

***
I arrived in Ann Arbor with 

a new plan: I was going to join 
a fraternity, enjoy the college 
experience and apply to the Ross 
School of Business. 

By the end of September, I 

had a C in Econ 101, and I hadn’t 
received a bid to a fraternity. 

Desperate for a way to fill my 

time, I stumbled upon the contact 
information for the sports editors 
at The Daily.

I typed up an email that I now 

know was too formal. I attached a 
resume. I explained that I’d never 
written for a newspaper, but I’d 
really appreciate an interview.

I got a response from Greg at 

2 a.m., which now makes perfect 
sense to me.

“Just come to a meeting this 

Sunday, there’s no application,” 
it read.

I went to that meeting, found 

Greg, was ushered into a confer-
ence room full of strangers, and 
the icebreaker began. The third 
person to speak enlightened us 
about how he/she had received 
a hickey the size of a tennis ball 
that weekend. One guy was wear-
ing a suit and tie (Hey, Jake).

I questioned what I was get-

ting myself into, until I didn’t. As 
the icebreaker moved on, I real-
ized I was surrounded by some 
characters. They were weird, but 
in the best way. I knew this was 
a community I wanted to be a 
part of.

I didn’t know then that the 

same community would teach 
me chairmonkey, land me inside 
the National Cowboy & Western 
Heritage Museum in Oklahoma 
City, thrust me into Wild Tymes 
in St. Paul, make me fall in love 
with Lincoln, introduce me to 
Kansas City barbecue, send me to 
Tampa to cover a bowl game, or 
allow me to find some some of my 
best friends. 

But here we are.
***
I called my parents this 

November. 

I started crying like a baby. 
I had two papers and a pre-

sentation due the next day, one of 
which was already late. 

I hadn’t had time to work on 

them, because I’d been working 
at The Daily all week.

I told them I wanted this to be 

over. 

My mom said everything 

would be ok. My dad said it would 
be over soon. 

When I was a freshman, I 

told them I wanted to chase this 
newspaper thing as far as it could 
go. They both gave me their sup-
port. They’ve done so countless 
times since. And I couldn’t have 
done any of this without them. 

But there I was on some 

November night, letting stress 
consume me enough that I 
uttered six words I never imag-
ined saying in my life.

I want this to be over. 
The notion seems blasphemous 

to me now.

Because it is over. 
And I’d give anything for 

Janet, or Vinnie, or TJ, or Mike 
or James to have gone here, so 
I would have never questioned 
coming here myself.

And I’d give anything for 

Mr. Moss to have told me about 
Michigan’s student newspaper in 
his office that day, so I could have 
emailed the sports editors earlier. 

And I’d give anything for my 

dad to have driven straight, so I 
could have seen this building an 
extra time. 

And I’d give anything to know 

I wasn’t getting into a fraternity 
the first day I stepped on campus, 
so I could have walked into this 
newsroom sooner. 

And I’d give anything to take 

back that phone call, if it meant I 
had just one more day.

COURTESY OF THE SANTO FAMILY

Kevin Santo always wanted to be like his older siblings growing up.

KEVIN
SANTO

One of the girls

I 

thought I would always be one 
of the guys.

Grow-

ing up, that’s 
what every-
one said 
about me. My 
guy friends 
who wanted 
me to know 
that I was just 
like them, 
and my girl 
friends who 
wanted me to know that I wasn’t.

Everyone knew me as the girl 

who loved sports. So naturally, 
that’s how I began to see myself. 
But as much as that was true, I 
couldn’t shake the feeling that 
there was something wrong with 
me.

Paired with the joy of playing 

soccer at Catalpa Park with my 
dad, playing basketball with the 
guys after church and playing 
catch with my brother in the front 
yard was the anxiety of arranged 
playdates with girls my age, icy 
glares down the school hallway 
and awkward mistakes about my 
gender.

While it would have been easier 

to write about the first three, that’s 
not what this story is about. In all 
honesty, if I were a boy, it likely 
would have been. But as a girl in 
a boy’s world, it’s more important 
for me to elaborate on the latter 
three. They are the ones that stick 
with me to this day, and not in a 
good way.

***
I used to have so much trouble 

with girls that it would have made 
more sense if I were a boy.

When I say that all of my friends 

were guys up until high school, 
I’m not exaggerating. I wasn’t pur-
posely avoiding girls. I just didn’t 
have anything to say around them. 
All the girls I knew only wanted to 
talk about shopping, clothes and 
makeup. They weren’t shallow. We 
just had different interests.

The more I hung out with them, 

the more I felt invisible. I couldn’t 
add to the conversation, because 
I didn’t know how. So I kept to 
myself, and the group kept going. 
In those moments of uncomfort-
able silence, I began to wonder if 

I was supposed to be interested in 
those things, too.

I still remember when, at the 

age of 10, my mom told me that 
one of the other parents had said 
it would be good for me to spend 
more time with girls instead of 
boys. But she didn’t explain why, 
and at the time, I didn’t under-
stand either.

In middle school, I was the 

only girl who wore pants instead 
of a skirt for our school uniform, 
and who kept my hair in braids 
or a ponytail instead of wearing it 
down. I didn’t think much of those 
choices back then. I just wanted 
to play outside with the guys at 
recess.

I didn’t just play sports with 

them, though. I could keep up 
with them in conversations about 
sports, too. I spent most of my free 
time as a child watching soccer, 
basketball, football and baseball. 
I started with the professional 
teams from my hometown of 
Detroit, and then learned about 
the national scene by reading a lot 
of stories on ESPN and viewing 
many hours of SportsCenter.

My standing as a genuine fan 

allowed me to gain the respect of 
the guys, along with acceptance 
into their group. So instead of 
walking from class to class with 
my best girl friend, I strolled down 
the hallway with my guys.

The move wasn’t received very 

well. I still remember how my 
body tensed up as I saw those 
girls staring at me disapprovingly. 
One of my guy friends told me not 
to worry because they were just 
jealous. I didn’t understand that 
either.

Now, I think I do. Gender roles 

are so quickly ingrained in us 
that we try to enforce them in 
ourselves and each other before 
we hit puberty. I think those girls 
thought they were trying to help 
me.

So did the older gentleman who 

saw my guy friends and I having 
a snowball fight in the parking lot 
one winter day.

I was still a child at the time, 

and I was wearing a hat that cov-
ered my hair. He saw two of my 
friends double-teaming me and 
happened to yell toward my broth-

er that he should come rescue the 
other little boy.

I froze. My brother looked at 

me. I’ve never seen him look so 
defeated. As he told the man that 
I was his little sister, I ran inside 
and cried.

***
When I joined The Daily fresh-

man year, I thought it would be 
easy to be the girl among guys.

I went to every weekly section 

meeting during my first semester, 
but I didn’t pick up any stories. 
During my second semester, I 
stopped coming to meetings alto-
gether. It took until March, when 
I received an email from the Man-
aging Sports Editors at the time, 
for me to come back and write my 
first story.

I always tell people that I start-

ed my Daily career late because of 
a tough academic course load and 
a leadership position in another 
student organization, but I’ve left 
out a key detail until now.

I had been around guys my 

whole life, but I soon discovered 
that my experience couldn’t com-
pare to joining a 40-person staff 

with maybe four girls in the room.

As I moved up the ladder, 

becoming a beat writer and an edi-
tor, I kept noticing the disparity 
and its subsequent effects. In four 
years, there has been only one time 
that two girls have worked togeth-
er on one of our six beats. And I’ve 
seen many four-man beats. There 
has also been only one time that 
two girls became two of our six 
senior editors simultaneously. And 
I’ve seen more than one shutout. 

The more I noticed it, the more 

I felt like the odd one out. There 
was only one other girl for me to 
look up to, and I needed her to help 
me see how far my career could 
progress. I followed in her foot-
steps on the softball, men’s bas-
ketball and football beats, and for 
two months, we were even senior 
editors together.

Kelly took me under her wing 

and finally gave me a sense of 
belonging. Because of her, I real-
ized how important it is to have a 
mentor who helps you grow into 
who you are meant to be.

So when I became the Co-

Managing Sports Editor, I wanted 

to help move the culture in the 
right direction and do that for the 
girls who came after me. And I’ll 
be honest, I didn’t always succeed. 
But in the four years I have been 
here, the future has never looked 
so bright.

Next year, there will be eight 

women consistently contribut-
ing to what we affectionately call 
the best college sports section in 
the country. Three of them will 
be senior editors together. That 
might not seem like much just by 
the numbers — even though one-
fifth beats one-tenth any day of 
the week — but when you know 
them like I do, it’s easier to under-
stand.

Laney, you have a heart of gold. 

Paige, you are a fierce soul. Anna, 
you have the brightest disposition. 
Aria, you are full of ambition. 
Sarah, you have more potential 
than you know. Maya, you have 
turned into a pro. Jodi, you are 
improving every day. Bailey, you 
are well on your way.

I’ve loved being your leader 

as much as I’ve loved leading the 
whole section. Keep moving in 
the right direction.

***
The Daily has done so much 

more for me than I could have 
ever imagined, and I could have 
written this whole column about 
the incredible experiences I’ve 
had from a sports perspective. 
But I don’t know the next time 
a woman will be writing these 
biweekly columns, so this is the 
story I knew I needed to tell. 

The greatest gift The Daily has 

given me is the understanding 
that there was nothing wrong 
with me after all. This community 
of girls has shown me that.

There is more work to be done, 

but my work here is done.

I thought I would always be 

one of the guys. But now, I’m 
finally one of the girls.

Ashame would like to thank 

everyone who read her stories 

throughout her Daily career.

sports believe in the power of

‘M’ overcomes the elements to win 17th straight

It took a postponement, four 

hour, 18 minute rain delay and eight 
innings of battling freezing rain but 
the Michigan baseball team (21-
11 overall, 8-0 Big Ten) has finally 
extended its win streak to 17.

The outcome of Sunday night’s 6-3 

win over Maryland (16-19, 3-5) came 
down to the eighth inning — the final 
inning before the Terrapins had to 
catch their flight home. Slugger Kevin 
Biondic came to the plate down four, 
representing the tying run with one 
out and the bases loaded.

He fought off an inside pitch 

to place a bloop into the outfield, 
where it looked destined to cut the 
Wolverines’ lead to two. Junior 
second baseman Ako Thomas came 
sprinting into the outfield, took a 
look over his left shoulder and laid 
out onto the block M in center field. 
When he stood up, the ball was in his 

glove and the win all but secured. As 
he fired the ball back to the infield, 
Thomas’ hat flew off his head like 
Willie Mays making ‘the catch.’

“That should be on Sports Center 

tonight,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “I don’t know if there are 
nine better plays in sports today 
than that one.

“It saved the game because that 

was two runs that would have 
scored and flip the momentum. 
Instead the momentum stayed 
with us. … That was a huge play in a 
huge spot and only Ako Thomas can 
make that play.”

Earlier in the game, Michigan 

took its first lead with four runs in 
the second after going down 1-0 in 
the top of the frame.

“Six quality at-bats in a row 

including three free passes,” Bakich 
said. “So drawing the three walks 
was a big part of it.”

Junior center fielder Jonathan 

Engelmann provided the fireworks, 

knocking home two with an 
opposite-field double after a bases-
loaded walk and RBI groundout to 
put the Wolverines in the lead.

“I didn’t think they were going to 

pitch to him with a base open and 
runners on second and third and 
one out,” Bakich said. “I thought 
they would pitch around him and go 
after (junior third baseman Blake) 
Nelson, but Engelmann did a good 
job, taking advantage of a 3-1 fastball 
to hit and drilled it down the line 
and got those two runs in.”

From 
there, 
freshman 
left-

hander Ben Dragani took over. He 
gave up two runs — more than his 
previous four starts combined — on 
two home runs but fought off the 
rain to make it through six innings.

He got into a jam in the fourth, 

with runners on second and third 
with one out before freezing Zach 
Jancarski with a fastball on the 
inside corner to get the strikeout. 
Dragani got the next batter to lazily 

fly out to right to get out of the inning 
unscathed.

“He seems very calm and 

collected out there,” Bakich said. 
“That, combined with his good 
stuff — he’s got a good fastball, good 
breaking ball, good changeup and 
the ability to command all of his 
pitches — creates an opportunity to 
escape a jam and that’s what he did.”

Added Dragani: “I was just trying 

to stay focused, and make the next 
pitch and make it as best I could, 
whether it was inside fastball or 
slider, just try to put it where coach 
calls for it.”

Freshman first baseman Jesse 

Franklin gave Dragani some room 
to breathe. He roped an RBI double 
off the right-field line in the fifth 
before blasting a solo home run two 
innings later.

Despite its eighth inning scare, 

that would be all Michigan needed 
to win its 17th in a row — the longest 
streak it has seen in three decades.

Despite wind, storms 
Michigan finishes third

The Michigan men’s track and 

field team’s runners struggled to 
make an impact. With lightning 
and high winds slowing down 
the track events at the Longhorn 
Invitational in Austin, TX., the 
Wolverines needed a boost. And 
with two personal bests and a 
broken school record, Michigan 
threw hammers like Thor and 
closed out the two-day event in 
third place overall.

Though the weather delayed 

the hammer throw by four hours, 
seniors 
Grant 

Cartwright 
and 
Joe 
Ellis 

proved 
their 

performances 
were 
worth 

the 
wait. 

After 
fouling 

three 
of 
his 

five 
attempts, 

Cartwright 
threw 
a 

personal-best 
65.47 meters — good for fourth 
place. Lightning struck twice 
for Ellis — after breaking the 
school record in hammer throw 
at the same invitational last year, 
he threw an outstanding 71.00 
meters, breaking his own record 
and winning first place.

Cartwright 
continued 
to 

score points on throws with a 
shot put of 18.19 meters, placing 
fifth. Junior Andrew Liskowitz 
scored the most points on shot 
put, throwing 19.13 meters and 
earning a third place finish.

As hammer throw and shot put 

carried the team with a stellar 
performance, Michigan coach 
Jerry Clayton remained collected 
when reflecting on his throwers.

“(Ellis) is coming into form,” 

Clayton said. “He’s ahead of 
where he was this time last year, 
and that’s what we want and 
expect. He threw a personal 

best, (Cartwright) had a personal 
best in the hammer. Very good 
opening throws for (Cartwright) 
and (Liskowitz) at the shot put. 
At this point, the big thing is to 
make sure we get (qualifying) 
marks.”

The strong performance on 

field 
events 
continued 
with 

senior Kevin Haughn jumping 
5.00 meters in the pole vault, 
landing fourth overall. At triple 
jump, senior Kevin Stephens Jr. 
hopped, skipped and jumped to 
third place overall with 14.96 
meters.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, wind 
speeds 
gusting 

up to 21 miles 
per hour proved 
detrimental 
to 

their track events. 
Despite a strong 
effort from Noah 
Caudy, 
placing 

seventh 
and 

ninth at the 400-
meter 
hurdles 

and 
100-meter 

hurdles, respectively, they failed 
to score any points on foot.

Michigan’s distance runners 

were uncharacteristically absent, 
but to Clayton, this was the plan 
coming in.

“We didn’t take any distance 

runners,” Clayton said, “because 
they’ll be going this weekend 
to a very prestigious meet, the 
(Cardinal Classic).”

Although 
the 
Wolverines 

struggled in the track events, the 
team was overall satisfied with 
its performance.

“We went into the meet with 

a partial team, because (the 
Longhorn Invitational) is really 
good for the field events and 
sprints and hurdles,” Clayton 
said. “We divided the team up. 
Texas is not the place for 800-
meter events and up. Taking a 
partial squad, I thought we did 
quite well.”

Michigan sweeps doubleheader

Sometimes, a sweep is nice 

and easy.

Other times, the wins on the 

record conceal the less-than-
glamorous means it took to get 
there.

The latter was the case for 

the No. 17 Michigan softball 
team (10-1 Big Ten, 35-7 overall) 
on Friday when it swept a 
doubleheader against Rutgers 
(2-7, 17-21) with scores of 11-1 
and 9-2. Despite the lopsided 
numbers on the scoreboard, 
both games at times seemed as 
if they could slip away from the 
Wolverines.

It was evident from the start 

of the first game that freshman 
left-hander Meghan Beaubien 
didn’t have her best stuff. She 
allowed a double and a single 
in the first inning to put the 
Scarlet Knights on the board. 
Michigan was in an unfamiliar 
position: playing from behind.

“It’s kind of like getting in a 

fight,” said senior right-hander 
Tera Blanco. “You get punched 
first, well, what are you gonna 
do? You’re obviously gonna 
punch back. (So) that was kind 
of our mentality.”

The 
Wolverines 
didn’t 

take long to punch back, as 
sophomore 
third 
baseman 

Madison Uden hit a grand slam 
in the bottom of the frame to 
put Michigan up, 4-1.

From there, it was mostly 

smooth 
sailing. 
Beaubien 

settled in and the Wolverines 
kept tacking on runs. A two-
RBI double from senior first 
baseman Aidan Falk in the third 
and RBI singles from freshman 
shortstop 
Natalia 
Rodriguez 

and junior center fielder Natalie 
Peters extended the lead to 8-1 
when Blanco stepped up to the 
plate.

The 
first 
three 
pitches 

missed, but Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins gave Blanco — 
who had already walked three 
times — the green light to 
swing. She did, and launched 
the ball out of the stadium for a 
three-run home run to end the 
game with the score 11-1.

“I told her before she got 

to bat, ‘Hey, if they put one in 
there, just hit it to the moon,’ 
” Falk said. “She hit it past the 
moon.”

The beginning of the second 

game was reminiscent of the 
first. Blanco didn’t have her 
best stuff. She got out of the 
inning with no damage done, 
but consistently fell behind in 
counts. The Wolverines got an 
early 3-0 advantage on a two-
run home run by Falk and a RBI 
single from Canfield, but the 
lead felt uncomfortable.

In the fourth, a double and a 

single cut Michigan’s lead to 3-1, 
and, while Blanco scored on a 
single from Uden in the bottom 
of the frame, she found herself 
in more trouble in the fifth.

A double, a walk and a 

single once again shaved the 
Wolverines’ margin to two. 
Then Blanco allowed another 
single to put runners on first 
and second with two outs and 
Rutgers’ best hitter, Rebecca 
Hall, coming to the plate. 
Hutchins opted to intentionally 
walk Hall instead of having her 
face the struggling Blanco.

“(We) were debating whether 

we were gonna walk her and 
then put in Meghan, whether 
we would change pitchers,” 
Hutchins said. “ … She’s their 
best player. She’s hitting .400, 

her stats are huge.

“ … We left her in because 

Tera has to be able to pitch 
herself 
out 
of 
jams, 
and 

sometimes we’ve taken her out, 
but tonight her offense was on 
and we’ve gotta be able to trust 
that her offense can make up 
anything that happens.”

Hutchins was right. After 

running a full count, Blanco 
came back to strike out the final 
batter swinging and minimize 
the damage. And in the bottom 
of the inning, her two-run 
single erased any memory of her 
struggles.

Michigan would add two 

more runs in the frame on a 
bases-loaded walk and a wild 
pitch and another in the sixth 
on a solo home run off the bat of 
Falk, and by then the score was 
9-2 and what was once a tense, 
dramatic contest was suddenly 
anything but.

“You can see the intensity 

go up and down in the lineup,” 
Hutchins said. “We get ahead 
in the game, we were 3-0, I 
thought we kinda coasted for a 
couple innings. … Then we — the 
game’s getting tight, and then I 
thought our intensity tightened 
itself up.”

Maybe, for a team used to 

near-effortless wins, a little 
adversity was just what the 
doctor ordered.

Senior first baseman Tera Blanco hit a game-winning homer on Friday. 

Strong pitching ignites 
‘M’ vs. Scarlet Knights

Coming 
into 
Friday’s 

doubleheader, the Michigan 
softball team had allowed only 
one run in seven home games 
this season.

But there were points in 

both games on Friday against 
Rutgers where it appeared 
as 
though 
the 
Wolverines 

were at risk of surrendering 
multiple runs in an inning — 
a rare occurrence for a team 
that had previously outscored 
opponents 
at 
home, 
46-1. 

Clutch pitching performances, 
though, 
prevented 
multiple 

runs from crossing the plate.

In the opening frame of 

the doubleheader’s front end, 
freshman left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien found herself in a 
jam. A walk, wild pitch and 
double gave Rutgers a 1-0 lead. 
Then a single put runners on 
the corners with only one out.

Despite giving up the early 

run, Beaubien remained even-
keeled — setting down the next 
two batters on a popout and 
groundout to junior second-
baseman Faith Canfield.

“They were on Meghan, that 

was the thing,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “But 
you can’t panic. … Honestly, 
it’s better if they score early, so 
that your team can get going.”

After stranding two runners 

in the first inning, Beaubien did 
not allow a hitter to reach base.

In the fifth inning of the 

doubleheader’s 
nightcap, 

senior 
right-hander 
Tera 

Blanco allowed two runners 
to reach base with one out and 
gave up an RBI single, cutting 
the Wolverines’ lead to 4-2. 
Michigan opted to intentionally 
walk infielder Rebecca Hall 
— who boasts a .391 batting 
average –– to load the bases.

The Wolverines and their 

lead looked vulnerable.

After getting ahead, 1-and-

2, Blanco ran the count full 
against 
freshman 
infielder 

Myah Moy. 

“Hutch just said, ‘Do what 

you’ve been doing’, ” said 
Blanco, “and (catcher Katie 
Alexander) 
was 
just 
like, 

‘Do you,’ and that’s just me 
attacking the zone and trusting 
my stuff and trusting my 
defense.”

Blanco wound up and fired 

the pitch past a swinging batter 
for the third out of the inning.

In both games, the Michigan 

offense — seemingly energized 
by 
the 
performances 
of 

Beaubien 
and 
Blanco 
— 

responded by putting up four 
runs in the bottom half of the 
inning.

“Sometimes kids don’t seem 

to have as intense of at-bats 
when 
they’re 
not 
behind,” 

Hutchins said, “but I thought 
we responded well.”

The runs came courtesy of 

a grand slam by junior third 
baseman Madison Uden in the 
first game, and a combination 
of a bases-loaded walk, a two-
RBI single by Blanco and a wild 
pitch that scored a run in the 
second game.

Both 
instances 
gave 
the 

Wolverines comfortable leads 
and sparked the offense for 
the remainder of the contest. 
The confidence exuded by the 
pitching staff spilled over to 
the offense in both games of the 
doubleheader.

Michigan wound up taking 

both contests by scores of 11-2 
and 9-2.

“We just knew that we could 

come back with the bats,” said 
senior utility player Aidan Falk, 
“and that really didn’t scare us 
at all and we did, so that was all 
we needed.”

SOFTBALL
Rain showers can’t cool off red-hot Wolverines

Typically, baseball drama comes 

in the form of a walk-off hit, a major 
comeback or a strikeout late in a 
game. But this weekend, Michigan 
experienced 
something 
new: 

scheduling drama.

The Friday game, the first 

of a three-game series against 
Maryland (3-5 Big Ten, 16-19 
overall), saw no issues for the 
Wolverines in any way, as they 
beat down on the Terrapins in a 
10-4 win. With Saturday, though, 
new issues arose for the surging 
Wolverines (8-0, 21-11).

Even though the temperature 

was hovering around 70 degrees 
Thursday, Saturday’s combination 
of 
near-freezing 
temperatures 

and rain created unwelcoming 
playing conditions. The game was 
postponed until Sunday, setting up 
a doubleheader.

“We can’t control it so there’s 

no sense getting frustrated about 

it,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “The weather, especially in 
Michigan, is just one of those things 
that you know that you’re gonna 
battle the elements here.”

Similar problems arose again 

on Sunday, though, and instead 
of playing the doubleheader, the 
Wolverines experienced a weather 
delay for over four hours before 
finally getting in only one weather-
shortened game. Maryland had to 
catch a flight home at 10:00 p.m. so 
the game, which ultimately began at 
5:18, was played with the stipulation 
that no new inning could begin after 
7:45 p.m.

Despite 
the 
massive 
delay, 

Michigan came out firing, as it put 
up four runs and batted through 
the lineup twice in just the first 
three innings. Ultimately a 6-3 
victory in eight innings brought the 
Wolverines’ win streak to 17. 

“Fortunately for us, we train 

outside in much worse, so when we 
have adverse conditions like today 
we can thrive in them,” Bakich said. 

“Our guys just didn’t seem phased. 
They didn’t seem phased by the 
delays, they didn’t seem phased by 
the conditions. If anything, they 
think it’s an advantage.”

Freshman 
left-hander 
Ben 

Dragani tossed six innings of 
two-run baseball, continuing his 
dominant stretch as a starter. 
Dragani, who is from Wisconsin, 
echoed his coach’s sentiments, 
adding that he is used to playing in 
poor conditions. 

“In Wisconsin, high school 

baseball isn’t (played in) the best 
weather,” Dragani said. “It’s raining, 
it’s cold, below freezing a lot. We had 
games a lot where it was snowing, 
so having those experiences really 
helped that factor like, you’ve done 
it before, it’s nothing new.”

Freshman first baseman Jesse 

Franklin also continued his recent 
success, as he went 3-for-4 with two 
doubles and a home run on Sunday 
after going 2-for-3 with a home run 
Friday.

Like Dragani, Franklin — who 

is from the state of Washington — 
played through unusual baseball 
weather during his high school 
career and was well prepared to 
play in games with conditions 
similar to Sunday.

“Today was just kinda of about 

making sure I stayed mentally 
ready to play,” Franklin said. “I’m 
kind of used to that from Seattle and 
high school ball, like all the time it’s 
raining and you don’t know if you’re 
gonna play all day.”

Bakich made sure to emphasize 

the weather did not have any impact 
on the team’s performance. Rather, 
it was waiting to play and being 
in the dark as to when the game 
would start that impacted the team. 
Michigan, though, was ready for the 
challenge and handled the situation 
well.

“We got ready, and then at game 

time at four o’clock it wasn’t ready 
and so we had to wait another hour 
and 15 minutes,” Bakich said. “So all 
of that is what the adversity was and 
I thought our guys responded well.”

Michigan coach Erik Bakich emphasized that inclement weather didn’t affect his team’s performance at all in Michigan’s win against Maryland on Sunday.
