Internal report
released Friday
outlines UMHS
shortcomings
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
University administrators
have expressed concern after the
results of an internal investiga-
tion into former medical resident
Stephen Jenson's possession of
child pornography were released
to the public Friday.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman called the Univer-
sity of Michigan Health System's
six-month delay in reporting
the University's Department of
Public Safety that Jenson was
in possession of child pornog-
raphy a "serious failure on the
part of the institution." In a let-
ter to the campus community
on Friday, Coleman wrote that
University officials acknowledge
that the situation was handled
improperly and that University
officials hope the incident will
serve as a catalyst for strength-
ening campus security protocol
in the future. The report high-
lights information not previously
known to the public, including a
reportthatUMHS securityasked
DPS to use forensic resources to

examine a flash drive containing
the pornography, but DPS did not
return the voicemail.
Last May, a UMHS medi-
cal resident found a flash drive
containing images of child por-
nography plugged into a hospi-
tal computer in the residents'
lounge. The report notes she
opened files on the drive to
determine who owned it and
found Jenson's name. She left
work without reporting the inci-
dent and found that the flash
drive was removed the next day.
She then notified her supervi-
sor, the attending physician, who
notified the chair of the Medical
School Department Compliance
Officers.
On Dec. 2, Coleman was noti-
fied of the issue and asked the
University's Office of University
Audits to conduct an internal
review on Dec. 3. Regent Kath-
erine White (D-Ann Arbor),
chair of the University's Board
of Regents Finance, Audit and
Investment Committee was also
notified.
In the letter released Friday,
Coleman commended the medi-
cal resident who reported the
flash drive to hospital security,
notingthat she reported the inci-
dent "not once, but twice," a fact
that was previously not known.
"I want to apologize to her for
not properly investigating the

University plans
to build parking
structure in new
location
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
The city of Ann Arbor and
the University announced
on Friday that construction
of the Fuller Road intermo-
dal transportation station will
not continue as designed due

JL !.l

to complications with federal
funding.
The University intends to
still continue to build a park-
ing structure, just no longer
on Fuller Road where the ini-
tial station was planned to be
built. The parking facilities
will likely be built somewhere
on medical campus, as officials
begin to newly conceptualize
the project.
Jim Kosteva, the University's
director of community rela-
tions, said the complications
with federal funds stemmed
from issues with a funding

match requirement. To qualify
for the match, an environmen-
tal analysis needs to be com-
pleted and the Federal Railroad
Association must sanction the
plan, Kosteva said.
"(The environmental analy-
sis) is an 18-month process at
a minimum," Kosteva said.
"Then you can start the clock
applying for the funds for the
station construction platforms
and other improvements. So
we, at the University, are sit-
ting here and we look at this as
almost an indefinite period of
time."

Since more than 500 posi-
tions were added at the new-
ly-constructed hospitals, in
addition to
additional room
for patients 51'1 &0
and visitors,
Kosteva said
the demand is i
too large to wait
for the federal
funds to be assigned.
"As much as we have alter-
native forms of transportation,
some people still need to rely

By RAYZA GOLDSMITH

Though the official hear-
ing before the administrative

of graduate student research
assistants' unionization efforts
ended last Monday, a number of
groups are filing documents in
preparation for an extension of
the hearing process beginning
on Feb. 20,
On Thursday, Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette
and the Students Against GSRA

with the administrative law

today to the decision to allow
outside parties to produce evi-

of motion, according to GEO's

There is no guarantee that
the requested witnesses will
be allowed to testify, because
the decision will be made at

Fart joke misinterpreted

Harold Wayne Hadley Jr., a stu-
dent at Jones County Junior College in
Mississippi, was arrested on Tuesday
after allegedly writing a note on toilet
paper that included the word "bomb,"
according to The Huffington Post Col-
lege.
After the note was found, 11 emer-
gency agencies were dispatched to the
campus.
The Huffington Post reported that
the Hadley family said the note only
referred to their son's "joy of flatulat-
ing in the library" and was not meant
to be a threat to the school.
The full extent of what Hadley actu-
ally wrote has yet to be revealed, but
he was arrested and held on $20,000
bail. The Huffington Post also reported
that Hadley could face up to 10 years in

Lacrosse is the most recent the Titan defense early to score
varsity sport to be added to the the first goal of the game and the

first goal in Michigan varsity his-
tory. Minutes later, he would rep-
licate the feat, giving Michigan
(0-1) an early 2-0 lead.
Detroit (1-2) responded quickly,
in what would become the theme
for the back-and-forth first half.
Neither team was able to establish
a lead, and the score was tied on
three separate occasions. While
the Titans maintained a slight
advantage in shots on goal and
faceoffs won, an impressive five-
save performance in the first half
by sophomore Dylan Westerhold
kept the score tied at 5-5.
"Dylan started the season as

our third goalie," said Michi-
gan coach John Paul. "He came
in today because of an injury to
(freshman) Emil Weiss and played
a really, really good first half."
Detroit's aggressive style of
play began to wear down the
Wolverines by the second half.
After a few more back-and-forth
exchanges, the Titans scored four
straight goals beginning late in the
third quarter. Costly turnovers by
Michigan and quick counterat-
tacks by Detroit turned momen-
tum against the Wolverines, who
were outscored 8-4 in the second
half.

"Mentally, I think we kind
of fell apart towards the end of
the game," said fifth-year senior
attackman Trevor Yealy. "I
wouldn't say that they were run-
ning all over us, but I think (that)
mentally, they were a little more
focused for the latter part of the
game, and we've got to work on
staying focused for the entirety of
the game."
This being its first Division-I
year, Michigan cannot afford to
make mental mistakes.
At a much higher level of play,
the Wolverines will not be able to
outmatch their opponents with

pure talent, so they must play
intelligently to remain competi-
tive.
Sunday's first half against
Detroit provided a glimpse of the
direction the team will move in.
This season, the ultimate goal
for the team is to make sure this
visionbecomes a reality.
"We've got to make sure that we
keep going forward and we don't
take any steps back," Yealy said.
With their introduction to
varsity lacrosse now out of the
way, the Wolverines will face off
against Penn State in State College
next Saturday.

lawsuit against
0 Pope withdrawn
Lawyers for a man who was
sexually abused decades ago by a
priest at a Wisconsin school for
the deaf have withdrawn their
lawsuit naming Pope Benedict
XVI and other top Vatican offi-
cials as defendants.
Attorney Jeff Anderson filed
the lawsuit in 2010. He claimed
former Cardinal Joseph Ratzing-
er and his deputies knew about
allegations of sexual abuse at the
school and protected the priest
from punishment.
Anderson's firm withdrew the
case Friday in Milwaukee. He
explains the action by saying the
main thing he was seeking was
information and accountability,
and he's already received 30,000
pages of revealing documents

" An Egyptian woman who

It was not immediately clear
whether the woman, identified
as 41 year-old Nermeen Gomaa
Khalil, was targeted or killed in
a random crime. Police said she
was shot by unidentified gun-
men passing in another car, but
no one has been arrested.
Khalil was shot in broad day-
light while driving her SUV on
one of Cairo's busiest streets in
the neighborhood of Mohandi-
seen, according to a security
official who spoke on condition

of anonymity because he was not

Rescuers cheered and pumped
their fists in the air late Saturday

SIlE INTEL GROUP/AP
Al-Qaida's leader Ayman al-Zawahri in a still image from a web postng by al-Qaida's media arm, as-Sahab, yesterday.
A-Qaida backs Syrian
,-revolt and bombingsQ:

Violence increases
potential for
civil war, future
uncertain
BEIRUT (AP) - Al-Qaida's
leader has called for the ouster
of Syria's "pernicious, cancer-
ous regime," raising fears that
Islamic extremists will try to
exploit an uprising against Pres-
ident Bashar Assad that began
with peaceful calls for demo-
cratic change but is morphing
into a bloody, armed insurgency.
The regime has long blamed
terrorists for the 11-month-old
revolt, and al-Qaida's endorse-
ment creates new difficulties
for the U.S., its Western allies
and Arab states trying to figure
out a way to help force Assad
from power. Yesterday, the
22-nation Arab League called
for the U.N. Security Council
to create a joint peacekeeping
force for Syria, but Damascus
rejected it immediately.
In an eight-minute video
message released late Satur-
day, al-Qaida chief Ayman al-
Zawahri called on Muslims to
support Syrian rebels.
"Wounded Syria is still

bleeding day after day, and the
butcher (Bashar Assad) isn't
deterred and doesn't stop,"
said al-Zawahri, who took
over al-Qaida after Osama bin
Laden was killed by U.S. spe-
cial forces last May.
The United Nations esti-
mates more than 5,400 people
have been killed in Syria since
the uprising began in March.
But that figure is from Janu-
ary, when the U.N. stopped
counting because the chaos in
the country has made it all but
impossible to check the figures.
While many of the anti-
government protests sweeping
the country remain peaceful,
the uprising as a whole has
become more violent in recent
months as frustrated demon-
strators and army defectors
take up arms to protect them-
selves from the steady military
assault. An increasing num-
ber of army defectors known
as the Free Syrian Army have
launched attacks, killing sol-
diers and security forces.
Syria now has become one
of the deadliest conflicts of the
Arab Spring, and many fear
the country of 22 million at
the heart of the Arab world is
on the verge of a civil war that

could engulf the region.
In a grave escalation of the
violence, a string of suicide
attacks have killed dozens of
people since late December.
The latest, twin bombings
in the major northern city of
Aleppo, killed at least 28 peo-
ple on Friday, the government
said. Some 70 people were
killed in earlier attacks in the
capital, Damascus, on Dec. 23
and Jan. 6. All the blasts struck
security targets.
Nobody has taken respon-
sibility for the attacks, but
the regime said they have the
hallmarks of al-Qaida and
immediately blamed the global
terror group.
Saturday's statement by
al-Zawahri appears to bol-
ster Assad's accusations, but
the Syrian opposition and the
Free Syrian Army reject the
government's claims entirely.
They accuse forces loyal to the
regime of setting off the blasts
to smear the opposition, ter-
rify people into submission
and exploit fears of chaos and
sectarian warfare.
For many Syrians, the
uncertainty over the future is
cause for alarm in a country
that has watched neighboring

tional Resources Network.
Focus: HOPE is a non-profit
organization based in Detroit
that was created in 1968 to over-
come racism, poverty and injus-
tice in southeast Michigan. The
problems and data Focus: HOPE
presented to the a2DataDive par-
ticipants concerned its HOPE
Village Initiative, a program
dedicated to creating a stable and
safe neighborhood for families in
Detroit and a section of Highland
Park.
Patrick Cooper, a represen-
tative of Focus: HOPE, said the
a2DataDive gave the organiza-
tion a clearer picture of the people
it helps by creating a map that
organizes participants not only by
where theylive, but also by income
level and level of involvement.
"Data scientists here have been
able to look at (our data) and been
abletodevelop anin-depthpicture
of who's in the HOPE Village ver-
sus the rest of the city of Detroit,
and what kind of programs need
to be developed to respond to their
needs," Cooper said.
Cooper added that apart from
the demographic map, one group
studied traffic and safety around
Focus: HOPE's location, which
will help make it easier for people
to travel to the program locations.
"Maybe some people are inhib-
ited from getting involved simply
because it's difficult to walk across
the expressway," Cooper said.
"We'll be able to use the informa-
tion that came out of this event to
help negotiate for improvement
for pedestrian traffic."
The other beneficiary of the
a2DataDive was African Health
OER Network, which is part of
OER Africa, an initiative estab-
lished by the South African Insti-
tute for Distance Education.
According to a handout at the

tion communities."
Participants who worked with
the African Health OER Network
focused on two aspects of the
organization- the people who are
involved in the network and the
content generated by the network.

Kathleen Omollo, project man-
ager for the African Health OER
Network, said the information
analyzed during the a2DataDive
will help the organization see who
is active within the Health OER
Network.
"What I think will be most
valuable is seeing the people who
haven't been connected as much
and try to get them more involved
in events and reach out to them
more often," Omollo said.
The second group that worked
with the African OER Health
Network analyzed educational
YouTube videos that the network
generates. Omollo said the analy-
sis of the comments on the videos
was particularly interesting.
"Just that graphic they had
showing the frequency of words
'thank' and 'thank you' and 'grate-
ful' and 'very' being among the
highest is amazing," Omollo said.
... I can already think of so many
people who will be excited to see
that particular graphic."
Apart from collaborating
to help Focus: HOPE and the
African Health OER Network,
participants took part in three
information coding workshops
and hear from keynote speaker
David Burke, aprofessor of human
genetics at the University Medical
School.
Inaninterviewafterhisspeech,
Burke said he felt the a2DataDive
is centered around showing par-
ticipants how they can best utilize
what they learn.
"(The DataDive) is important
and useful, and you can feel that
when you talk to these people,"
Burke said. "They feel like they've
spent their time on something that
really has value and that is a good
part of what you have to do at a
university."
The a2DataDive was inspired
by the original DataDive created
by Data without Borders. Nikki
Roda, a first year masters student
in the School of Informatics and
one of the coordinators of a2Data-
Dive, attended the original event
in New York last October.
Roda said she, along with the
other coordinators of the event,
is already planning next year's
a2DataDive, and hopes this year's
success will allow the event to
expand.
"There's enough excitement
that maybe we can transition (the
a2DataDive) in such a way that it
will be easier for us to find non-
profits and it will be easier for us
to find participants," Roda said.

Plans to halt
omney's Maine
momentum

PORTLAND, Maine (AP)
- A day after Mitt Romney
regained some momentum in
the Republican presidential
contest, his rival Rick Santo-
rum went on the attack, calling
the front-runner "desperate"
while promising to compete
aggressively to win the state
where Romney grew up.
Santorum said yesterday he
could do "exceptionally well"
in Michigan, where Romney's
father served as governor. The
Midwestern state and Arizona
host Republican presidential
nominating contests on Feb.
28.
"We're going to spend a
lot of time in Michigan and
Arizona, and those are up
next. And that's where we've
really been focusing on,"
Santorum told ABC's "This
Week." He suggested that a
strong showing in those con-
tests would make the presi-
dential contest "a two-man
race," dismissing current
rivals Newt Gingrich and
Ron Paul.
Santorum shrugged off his
third-place finish Saturday
in caucuses in Maine, where
he didn't actively compete,
as well as his second-place
finish in a straw poll of con-

servative activists.
Romney has been paint-
ing Santorum as a long-time
Washington insider who pur-
sued home-state projects. San-
torum on Sunday described
Romney's recent criticism as
"desperate."
"You reach a point where
desperate people do desperate
things," said Santorum, who
represented Pennsylvania dur-
ing his 16 years in Congress,
first in the House and then in
the Senate.
Maine GOP officials
declared Romney the winner
of Saturday's caucuses. The
results ended a three-state los-
ing streak to Santorum, who
swept contests in Colorado,
Minnesota and Missouri on
Tuesday.
With the next primaries

more than two weeks away, the
break seems unusually long in
the rapid-fire race that's fea-
tured six contests in the last
14 days. Romney and his rivals
now have 17 days to raise cash
and bolster their organiza-
tions for what's shaping up
to be a slog to the Republican
nomination and the right to
face President Barack Obama
in November.
As Santorum eyes Michi-
gan, Romney turns his atten-
tion to extending his huge cash
advantage over his rivals.
The Massachusetts gover-
nor left Maine before the cau-
cus results were announced to
attend a West Coast fundraiser
Saturday night. He issued a
written statement to mark his
victory in the low-turnout con-
test.

Planned atta cks
Divestment threatens women's health care
Last week, amid public outcry, the breast cancer foundation,
Susan G. Komen for the Cure reversed its decision to cut fund-
ing for Planned Parenthood. The foundation's initial decision
to pull funding elicited much opposition and reignited the political
debate over abortion. While it's good that Komen ultimately reversed
its decision, this was only one in a series of attacks on Planned Parent-
hood. Conservative groups need to stop making Planned Parenthood
the face of abortion and attacking its programs, many of which pro-
vide essential health-related services to women.

Do not reply

WhenI think back to my
first e-mail address, it's
with a sense of nostal-
gia that's usu-
ally reserved for
childhood pets
- which my par-
ents didn't love
me enough to
invest in.
It was an AOL
account, from ANDREW
the pioneer- WEINER
ing days of the
Internet. This
was when e-mail
addresses were paid for monthly
and the words "speed" and "Inter-
net" didn't belong in the same
sentence. What e-mails would an
elementary schooler have received?
Still, the blue spectrum of AOL is as
burnt into my memory as the excite-
ment I felt when I saw I had a new
message.
Unfortunately now when I look
at my inbox, which consists of three
accounts routed to my phone, I do so
begrudgingly. I delete, ignore and
respond - and almost always in that
order. Sifting through usually takes
longer than reading and responding
to the important items.
It has to be asked: Is e-mail still
working? And it's not just whiny
students like me asking this ques-
tion.
In 2010, Symantec - the compa-
ny behind Norton Antivirus - esti-
mated that 92 percent of e-mail is
spam. While this number is shock-
ing, most of this is caught in increas-
ingly advanced spam filters and
doesn't significantly curb efficiency.
Atos - an information technolo-
gy firm with nearly 80,000 employ-
ees - audited its staff's e-mail
accounts in December. They found
only 10 percent contained impor-
tant information. In response, the
company's CEO announced Atos
would phase out e-mail over the
coming 18 months.
Instead, it'll replace e-mail with
phone conversations, face-to-face
interactions and a business network
tool - a sort of company Facebook,
something many firms already have.
It's a telling sign when one of the
world's largest IT companies finds
it prudent to leave e-mail in the

dumpster of forgotten communica-
tion tools with fax machines and
telegrams.
Other companies, however, are
rethinking e-mail systems for rea-
sons beyond efficiency. On Dec. 23,
Volkswagen decided it would begin
to turn on and shut off company
BlackBerry e-mail services half an
hour before and after work hours,
respectively. This wasn't just a case
of a corporation gaining a sense of
compassion. The move was a result
of serious negotiation with labor
unions.
Instant communication like
e-mail has induced the mood that
instant responses are expected at all
hours of the day. That's not a prob-
lem when returning a text from a
friend, but it carries costly implica-
tions for businesses.
Imagine if someone dislikes his
or her job. They don't get the satis-
faction many get from their work
or maybe the management's inepti-
tude isn't as endearing as Steve
Carell's on "The Office." For those
who look forward to non-business
hours and weekends, smartphones
and e-mail provide a constant and
probably unwanted tie to the office.
Job satisfaction is at a discourag-
ing low in America. According to a
2010 Conference Board study, only
45 percent of Americans are satis-
fied with their jobs. Though data
on happiness is always inexact and
contested, the downward trend is
alarming. When the study was con-
ducted in 1987, job satisfaction was
at 61.1 percent. With less distinction
between work and downtime, it will
continue to decrease.
Most companies are not Volk-
swagen. They continue to bar-
rage employees with after-hours
e-mails. Not surprisingly, this has
already spelled trouble for many.
The "e-mail as overtime" debate is
popping up in courtrooms across
America. In 2009, real estate giant
CB Richard Ellis and mobile com-
munications company T-Mobile
both faced lawsuits from employees
about after-hours communications.
The federal Fair Labor Standards
Act regulates overtime pay. The act
itself is lawyer-y and complex. Two
things, however, are easy to under-
stand.

First, employers have legal obli-
gation to know when their employ-
ees are working and pay them for
the time. Second, FLSA is in some
ways outdated - especially its over-
time policy.
Some companies have attempted
to work around the system. In 2008,
ABC News attracted legal trouble
when employees refused to sign a
waiver stating they wouldn't be paid
for using company-issued BlackBer-
rys after hours. Employees can't
waive FLSA rights. If they could, all
employers could bully workers into
doing so - defeating the purpose of
employee protection.
I delete, ignore
and respond
- in that order.
The precedent to decide if e-mails
are even overtime is a debate in
itself. In the 1940s, courts ruled
that awarding overtime to employ-
ees performing work at home would
be decided on a basis of de mini-
mis. Judges have to decide the very
minimum amount of work needed
to qualify as compensational. Inter-
pretation of de minimis has varied
from judge to judge. Can the action
be quantified and aggregated? Is ita
matter of effort or time?
Even as it appears e-mail is going
by the wayside, the problem needs to
be addressed before more lawsuits
complicate the matter. The Depart-
ment of Labor needs to have more
explicit and modern definitions
of overtime law. Workers should
know their rights and realize in
most cases they aren't obligated to
keep working when they get home.
Employers need to understand the
risk of costly public lawsuits, work
with employees instead of against
them and explore alternative means
of communication - even if they
entail old-fashioned methods like
actually speaking. In person.

Komen announced its plans to cut fund-
ing for Planned Parenthood on Jan. 31, cit-
ing a policy that forbids donations to groups
under investigation. The decision elicited
public opposition and was criticized for
being politically motivated. In the aftermath
of the announcement, Planned Parenthood
received an outpouring of support via social
media outlets and it raised more than $3
million. Caving to public pressure, Komen
reversed its decision on Feb. 3 and apologized
to Planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood is unfairly targeted
by anti-abortion groups. Only 3 percent of its
health services are abortion-related. Beyond
that, Planned Parenthood provides cancer
screenings, testing for sexually transmit-
ted diseases and family planning guidance.
These are all services that empower women
and advance women's health. Anti-abortion
groups regularly manipulate the facts to
make Planned Parenthood the scapegoat of
the abortion battle.
Komen prides itself on being a voice for
women's health. It's disappointing that an

organization that shares goals with Planned
Parenthood would resort to cutting funds for
political reasons. There's too much baseless
political rhetoric surrounding Planned Parent-
hood. Organizations need to check the facts
before making such drastic decisions.
Family planning, sexual protection and
STD screening are instrumental in health
education and awareness. Planned Parent-
hood provides a secure and comfortable envi-
ronment for women to use these services, and
it's especially useful for low-income women,
who couldn't otherwise afford care.
Health care for young women should con-
tinue to be easily accessible, and Planned
Parenthood ensures that it is. Abortion oppo-
nents need to stop attacking Planned Par-
enthood for procedures it rarely performs.
Planned Parenthood isn't an abortion orga-
nization - it's an organization that seeks to
empower and educate women about their
health. Conservative anti-abortion groups
need to understand that the variety of servic-
es offered by Planned Parenthood are instru-
mental in women's health care.

The war for oil theory

CliCk to change the world

A recent discussion in one of my Middle
Eastern studies classes on the topic of natu-
ral resources and U.S. foreign policy quickly
spiraled into a melee of rhetoric - one which
showed me how deeply misinformed many
Americans remain about the nature of the U.S-
led coalition intervention in Iraq. Most of my
classmates were adamant that the U.S. unjustly
invaded a sovereign Iraq in reckless pursuit of
the world's most sought-after natural resource.
The biggest flaw of the popular war for oil
theory is that it stands upon a speculative
foundation: the U.S. is a leading consumer of
the world's oil, Iraq is a major producer of oil
and Bush and Cheney were former oil entre-
preneurs. If one digs deep into research, one
may also discover a certain Halliburton sub-
sidiary named Kellogg, Brown and Root that
had contracts with the U.S. military early in
the war. These contracts were for military
logistics - shipping of supplies, construction
of base camps, mail delivery, trash collection
and doing laundry. KBR was granted no con-
tracts for Iraqi oil, and in fact was fired by the
U.S. Department of Defense for overcharging
for its services in 2006.
So what is this foggy concept? Did the U.S.
invade to plunder black gold with brute mili-
tary force? No U.S. or North Atlantic Treaty
Organization theft of Iraqi oil has ever been
reported by an official American private or
governmental source, or for that matter by
any Iraqi source.
Did the U.S. invade in order to open Iraq's
oil market? The U.S. already regularly pur-
chased oil from Iraq prior to the invasion,
though the amount was heavily dampened by
trade sanctions. If the U.S. needed more oil,
removing trade sanctions while requesting
that the United Nations lower financial sanc-
tions on Iraq would have done the job, as the
country was producing well below capacity
due to tight finances. Through the first year
of the invasion in 2003, the U.S. imported
notably less oil from Iraq than it had in the
previous three years - less than 500,000
barrels per day. At the time Iraq was only our
sixth-largest foreign supplier. In 2008 Iraq
was our seventh largest supplier.
Or maybe the U.S. invaded in order to lib-
erate the Iraqis, thus winning special favor in
future oil deals. In December 2009, the Iraqi
Ministry of Oil headed one of the largest oil
auctions in the history of the industry. Some
of the most lucrative contracts were awarded
to companies from China, Russia and France
- the three nations that most vehemently
opposed the 2003 coalition invasion.
The most fundamental law of economics

smashes the oil war hypothesis. Nine days
before the kickoff of the invasion, the average
U.S. retail price of gas was $1.72 a gallon. As
we all know, the price has only continued to
climb since then. Supply and demand proves
the U.S. has clearly not benefited from any
sort of secretive oil deals or increased import
since the invasion.
What the U.S. seems to have forgotten is
the official justification for the intervention:
Saddam Hussein's purported "weapons of
mass destruction." When it was discovered
that no such operational weapons existed, all
derision turned to the Bush administration.
Had Bush intentionally misled the world in
a belligerent quest for oil paid for in blood
rather than in dollars?
Two irrefutable facts contradict this.
First, no hard evidence has been uncovered
that suggests the Bush administration inten-
tionally misled anyone. Considering the
sheer number of diplomats in Washington
and among our NATO allies, this is astonish-
ing. Second, ina series of interviews with FBI
agent and Lebanese American George Piro,
Hussein admitted he did not have WMDs in
2003, but had planned to resume his weapons
program within a year. Out of perpetual fear
of renewed aggression from Iran, he admit-
ted to leading U.N. weapons inspectors on
repeated wild goose chases to convince the
international community he had WMDs,
hopefully scaring off Iranian belligerence.
The Bush administration did not have to
deceive the rest of the world - Hussein did
it himself.
The effect of Middle Eastern political sta-
bility on the global oil market was relevant to
U.S. interest. The Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s
and Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait caused
slight spikes in global oil prices, and the
effect on gas prices of a hypothetical major
multinational war of attrition in the region
could potentially bring many of the world's
modernized economies to a halt. The ulti-
mate motivation for invasion was in fact a
genuine - if not myopic - fear of Hussein's
weapons capabilities based on faulty intelli-
gence and fueled in part by a post-9/11 state
of semi-paranoia.
At such an outstanding academic insti-
tution like the University, we should really
strive after the facts, not the trendy politi-
cally weighted anecdotes. Sadly, almost nine
years since the invasion, the war for oil myth
still stands as the most popularly accepted
conspiracy theory in American history.

hile dressed in pajamas
at my breakfast table
last week, I joined more
than 407,000
other Americans
in telling Presi-
dent Barack A
Obama that we
disapprove of his
recent appoint-
ments to the U.S.
Food and Drug
Administration. KRISTEN
With a simple
tap on my smart- KILUK
phone, I was
able to connect
with a body of people who shared
my position.
Voicing my opinion through an
Internet petition was convenient,
but I have to wonder how effective
this process is. A simple click of the
mouse seems way too easy to have
a powerful impact on federal policy
and decision-making. Can it really
make a difference?
However menial my act of Inter-
net participation may seem, it's true
that the face of the World Wide Web
is changing. The Internet is becom-
ing a far more pivotal place - a
breeding ground for massive social
and political collaboration.
Take the Internet-mediated evo-
lution of the Occupy Wall Street
movement for example. It was first
organized on Twitter, and mobilized
many participants to protest through
events, petitions and articles posted
on Facebook. The movement even
has a central website, www.occu-
pytogether.org, where you can find
contact information for regional
Occupy groups and resources to
start up your own Occupy group.
The petition I signed last week,
though first posted at signon.org
in September, has suddenly gained
momentum this month. It's a call to
stop the appointment of government
officials who have ties to the very
industries which they are respon-

sible for regulating. The key request
of the petition is to remove Michael
Taylor, the FDA deputy commission-
er for foods appointed by Obama in
January 2010.
A quick look at Taylor's employee
profile on the FDA website shows
that he has worked in various gov-
ernment positions throughout the
FDA and Department of Agricul-
ture, in addition to some university
research positions. He is well-edu-
cated and experienced with issues
of food safety and policy. But scroll
down to the very end of the profile -
yes, it is listed as the very last detail
on the page - and you see that he
served as the vice president for pub-
lic policy at Monsanto Company. He
held the position from 1998-2001.
If you are not already aware,
Monsanto Company is the same
organization which championed
the use of pesticides such as DDT
and Agent Orange during and after
the Second World War. Given that
these two substances were later
banned by the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency due to their severe
health effects, I can't bring myself
to entrust the laws regarding the
health and safety of the American
population to a former employee
of such a profit-motivated, socially
irresponsible organization.
Though it may be inevitable that
sometimes the best experts in a field
happen to have worked in indus-
try, Michael Taylor's close associa-
tions with Monsanto and past public
stances on agricultural issues seem
to be diametrically opposed to the
purpose of the FDA. Frederick Ravid,
the creator of the petition criticizing
Michael Taylor, emphasizes it in the
body of the petition's text.
"Taylor was in charge of policy
for Monsanto's now-discredited GM
bovine growth hormone (rBGH),
which is opposed by many medical
and hospital organizations," Ravid
wrote. "It was Michael Taylor who
pursued a policy that milk from

rBGH-treated cows should not be
labeled with disclosures."
Taylor's current position in the
FDA makes him responsible for
overseeing U.S. food labeling, cre-
ating a strategy for food safety and
planning new food safety legislation.
Prior to his appointment, his posi-
tion did not exist.

Americans

should embrace
online petitions.

wasposted,issponsored by MoveOn.

lion members across America, we
have the strength - together - to
stand up to Washington and its cor-
porate lobbyists in order to achieve
real progressive change for real
people," the website states. "We are
democracy in action."
The philosophy of this website
and the example of the Michael Tay-
lor petition may be tools the Ameri-
can people should learn to embrace.
Though it is still questionable
whether such Internet tools can be
successfully used for the people to
gain adequate leverage againstlarge,
well-funded corporate interests, one
thing is for sure- they help keep an
eye on government officials through
the dissemination of information
and public collaboration.
The more tools we can use to let
them know we're watching, the

and we need to give them
a place to park at a reason-
able proximity of their place of
work," Kosteva said. "The phone
is literally ringing off the hook
with concern."
One issue the University
faces is the possibility of losing
employees who choose to move
to another hospital with easier
parking arrangements, Kosteva
added.
"These are individuals that
now have to come to work 45
minutes or an hour and a half
or so early because they have
to park and take a shuttle ride
to their place of work," Kosteva
said. "This is another 45 minutes
or an hour of time added up that
they cannot spend with their
families."
He added: "We are still com-
mitted to the vision, we still see
the value to us and to our sus-
tainable transportation objec-
tives. But, we also have some
dramatic and immediate needs
with parking for the medical
center."
City Council member Chris
Taylor (D-Ward 3) said that
though the Fuller Road station
plans have changed, the initia-
tive will still continue.
"It has slowed and it has
become slightly complicated, but
it will move forward, move for-
ward as soon as possible," Taylor
said.
Taylor said that the city has
shifted its focus to a commuter

judge will refuse our wit-
nesses," Raiman said. "We think
they'll likely make it to the stand."
GEO's response, once filed, will
likely address the issue of wheth-
er or not SAGU and the attor-
ney general's witnesses should
be allowed to testify based on
the standards set up by Stern
before the hearing. According to
Rodrigues, witnesses must bring
new facts to the table, not just
new opinions, and GEO plans to
challenge the idea that the new
witnesses will actually present
new, accurate information.
"If the administrative law
judge admits their testimony, it's
because she thinks it's impor-
tant, so I'll leave the fairness of it
up to her," Rodrigues said.
Witnesses being called by
Schuette include Engineer-
ing Dean David Munson; LSA
Dean Terrence McDonald; Kate
Barald, chair of the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs, and Stephen Forrest, the

rail station.
"There is no way to tell right
now how long it will take (for
federal funding to come in),"
Taylor said. "We have $2.8 mil-
lion right now from the (Fed-
eral Railroad Administration)
to conduct an environmental
assessment and the creation
of the drawing which will be a
multi-modal station."
Taylor explained that when
the project is redesigned, the
number of parking spaces will
be reduced.
"The design will be very dif-
ferent because now the design
has included over a thousand
parking spaces, most for the
University," Taylor said. "The
new design will not include that
level of parking."
Taylor added that he esti-
mated that the cost for the sta-
tion would be about $40 million,
with the city paying 20 percent.
"We will reach out to city
partners who will benefit from
the construction of the station,"
Taylor said. "These include
the University, the Michigan
Department of Transportation
and the AATA."
Taylor continued: "It is a hub
of transportation and the Fuller
Road station is an ideal area to
satisfy that need. It would be
a tremendous benefit to Ann
Arbor."
The station was part of a $2.8
million project that would've
included collaboration from the
University, Ann Arbor Trans-
portation Authority, Michigan
Department of Transportation,
AMTRAK and the Federal Rail-

road Administration. The initia-
tive was first proposed in 2008
when the University recognized
there would be a need for addi-
tional parking with the contin-
ued expansion and opening of
the new C.S. Mott Children's
and Von Voigtlander Women's
Hospital, according to Jim
Kosteva, the University's direc-
tor of community relations.
Originally, the University col-
laborated with the city of Ann
Arbor to design a facility that
would involve an additional
parking structure on Wall Street
near the University's Kellogg
Eye Center. However, after some
resistance from the neighboring
Riverside Park Place condomini-
um complex during public meet-
ings, the University decided to
reconsider the location.
The group in charge of the task
formed an intermodal project
that would incorporate parking
for UMHS and serve as a depot
for commuter rail, Kosteva said.
The group chose Fuller Road as
the new project location.
The multi-transport station
would have had a covered first
floor with a bus stop, close to
900 parking spaces and a plat-
form for trains, Kosteva said.
"There are 20,000 people
that work within a quarter-mile
radius," Kosteva said. "There
probably isn't a location along
any other major rail line that
will have a concentration of that
many employees. This way you
can serve hundreds or thou-
sands of people who might oth-
erwise drive their individual
cars into the Medical Center."

Create University-wide guidlines and protocols for reporting security incidents
The Office of the General Counsel, Health System Risk Management, Hospitals and Health Centers Security,
Housing Security, the Department of Public Safety and more will work together to establish clear guidelines.
Ensure individuals understand their legal duty to report
A memo, set to be issued by Feb. 20, to deans, deparment heads and directors will be meant to remind
University community members ofttheir obligation to report any unlawful activity to the proper authorities.
Improve communication between DPS, Hospital security and Housing Security
Hospital and Housing security should be aware of any crimes that occur in their jurisdictions and should clearly
identify themselves as security and not police. DPS and Hospital security also must formalize 911 procedures.
Consider new practices
Compare practices at the University with those at other institutions, potentially create a DPS liason to UMHS
and develop teams that can respond to any type of scenario.


University's vice president for
research, among others.
"That's a surprise to me,"
Raiman said of the attorney gen-
eral's witness list. "A pleasant
surprise, though."
Raiman added that he believes
the testimony of those like Barald
and Forrest will ultimately sup-
port Schuette and SAGU's case.
"They're called by the attor-
ney general, so the attorney gen-
eral definitely thinks that they
have something to say, which
strengthens our case," Raiman
said.
He added that he believes the
positions of some administrators
will definitely add credibility to
the case against unionization.
"I feel that the deans of the
colleges will have a lot of rel-
evant information to say about
the role of GSRAs in the Uni-
versity," Raiman said. "I think
that Dr. Forrest knows about the
research operation at this Uni-
versity, maybe better than any-
one, so I believe his testimony
will be very valuable in proving
that GSRAs are employees and
not students."

Rodrigues said she does not
think the fact that some of the
University's top administra-
tors are being called to testify
by Schuette, who is opposed to
unionization, should influence
the outcome of the hearing or
the decision of the Michigan
Employment Relations' Com-
mission. MERC has the final say
in whether or not GSRAs will
be granted the right to vote to
unionize, she added.
"Everyone, ultimately, is enti-
tled to their view on this issue,"
Rodrigues said. "But ultimate-
ly it's not administrators who
should be able to make this deci-
sion; it's the rights of the people
who are doing the work - the
GSRAs."
The witnesses, if granted the
right to testify, will be called
before the administrative judge
between Feb. 20 and Feb. 24.
While the testimony will not
function like the rest of the
hearing - there will be no cross
examinations, for example - the
judge will ask questions and the
parties will be allowed to submit
evidence.

allegations in May," Coleman
wrote. "It took an act of courage
to come forward again, and it is
because of her that the case is
now moving forward in the legal
system."
The report cites the Health
System Legal Office as a major
contributor to the delay, noting
that it "should be available for
legal advice but should not take
ownership of an investigation."
According to the report, the legal
office was aware of the case as
early as May 25, just days after it
was reported to Hospital Secu-
rity, though it wasn't reported to
police until December.
In her letter, Coleman also
criticized the lead attorney on the
case for "acting improperly when
the incident was reported to her."
"A University attorney must
not assume the lead role in inves-
tigating a potential crime of this
nature," Coleman wrote.
The attorney told the resident
her claims were "unfounded,"
according to the report. The
report also suggests that the
attorney delayed other UMHS
departments, like hospital secu-
rity, in their investigation efforts
because of inappropriate control
of the case.
"We conclude that the asser-
tion of improper control of the
investigation by the attorney and
reliance on her conclusions by
others were the root cause for
the delay and improper handling
of the initial report," the report
states.
Echoing Coleman's statement,
the audit criticizes the Health
System Legal Office for relying
on the single opinion of the lead
attorney, and further notes that
the office of Clinical Affairs or
the Health System Risk Man-
agement Office should have
been notified in order to protect
patients or employees involved,
"even in the absence of a criminal
investigation."
Coleman also wrote that
though the Jenson case has been
challenging, it will allow officials
to strengthen future procedures.
"I believe this experience,
painful as it has been, will enable
all of us to properly address the
seriousness of these issues with
any and all future renorts and

investigations," Coleman wrote.
"As a community, we must and
will be constantly vigilant."
According to the report, the
University will review its current
procedures regarding "police
and security reporting lines and
organizational structures" and
ensure they are up to par with
other universities.
DPS and hospital security
leaders will provide an "action
plan" regarding the recommen-
dations within 90 days, and a
benchmarking report will be
completed in six months.
The report also notes that
starting in June, University
Audits will conduct quarterly
follow-up reviews of the incident
"until all noted risks are appro-
priately mitigated."
In an e-mail to the UMHS
community on Friday, Ora Pesco-
vitz, the University's executive
vice president for medical affairs,
wrote that the health system is
cooperating with a review by
the Joint Commission, a national
healthcare accrediting organiza-
tion, of UMHS' reporting system
and infrastructure.
"We are working diligently,
along with campus leadership,
to correct the shortcomings
brought to light by this serious
lapse," Pescovitz wrote. "It is
important to remember that it
is both our individual and col-
lective responsibility to make
certain that the University of
Michigan Health System pro-
motes an environment of safety."
Pescovitz wrote that it is
important that UMHS determine
exactly what went wrong in this
instance in order to improve inci-
dent reportinglines inthe future.
"As an institution, we failed
to make sure that this resident's
concerns were investigated in a
thorough and timely manner,"
Pescovitz wrote. "We are com-
mitted to turning this failure into
a lesson, and turning that les-
son into actions that ensure that
when someone does the right
thing and reports a suspicion, we
have asafeguarded system and
appropriately trained personnel
in place to make sure the matter
is handled in a judicious and cor-
rect manner."
Pescovitz concluded here-mail
by ensuring UMHS faculty and
emolovees that administrators

are dedicated to improvement.
"Sometimes we fall short.
Sometimes we make mistakes,"
Pescovitz wrote. "Our commit-
ment to doing better has never
been stronger."
DeAndree Watson, president
of Central Student Government,
said increased transparency
between students and DPS is
necessary for the general safety
of students, adding that this
incident was not indicative of a
healthy correspondence.
"Transparency is essential in
that relationship," Watson said.
"I think (this incident) shows a
lack of transparency."
Watson added that this issue
could be representative of other
missteps of DPS, including shar-
ing important information with
students and the campus com-
munity.
"I think it definitely provides
room for concern about what
other things exist that we aren't
aware of," he said. "There have
been issues in the past about this
same type of situation where DPS
isn't as quick as students want
them to be in terms of releasing
information."
Watson added that the issue
won't hurt the deep-rooted con-
nection between students and
DPS.
"I think DPS has established
a positive relationship on cam-
pus," Watson said. "I don't think
this one incident is going to have
a serious or significant negative
impact on the student body."
Jenson is currently out of jail
on a personal recognizance bond
of $10,000, according to court
documents. Conditions of his
bond demand that he surrender
his passport, cease contact with
children, and not use the Inter-
net "for any reason."
The bond also requires that he
wear a GPS tether and not leave
the state unless travel is approved
by the court. According to court
documents, Jenson was granted
permission to travel to Utah on
Dec. 28and return on Jan. 16.
Jenson's preliminary exam,
a hearing in which prosecutors
must provide evidence that sug-
gests probable cause that Jenson
possessed child pornography, is
Feb. 16 at the 14A District Court
at Washtenaw Avenue and Hog-
back Road.

Jeffrey Zaslow killed in car
accident in northern Mich.

Best-selling author
co-wrote 'The Last
Lecture'
DETROIT (AP) - Best-selling
author Jeffrey Zaslow was killed
Friday when he lost control of his
car on a snowy road after promot-
ing his latest book in northern
Michigan. He was 53.
Zaslow, co-author of the
million-selling book "The Last
Lecture," was also a former col-
umnist for The Wall Street Jour-
nal and former advice columnist
for the Chicago Sun-Times.
Zaslow, who had an affinity for
stories of heroism and resilience,
worked on memoirs of U.S. Rep.
Gabrielle Giffords and airline
pilot Capt. Chesley "Sully" Sul-
lenberger.
"Jeff was a beautiful writer,
wonderful collaborator, lov-
ing husband, father and friend,"
Sullenberger, who was praised
for his skill after safely ditching
a plane in the Hudson River in
2009, said in a written statement
Friday. "Our whole family loved
him dearly and he will be sorely
missed."
Zaslow was killed in an acci-
dent Friday morning in Warner
Township, about 160 miles north-
west of Lansing, according to the
Antrim County sheriff's office.
Zaslow's car slid into the path of
a semitrailer. He was killed on
impact.
The sheriff's department did

not release the name of the vic-
tim, but literary agent and friend
Gary Morris confirmed Zaslow's
death. Morris said he was told of
Zaslow's death Friday evening
by the author's wife.
Zaslow was in northern Mich-
igan speaking about "The Magic

Room: A Story About the Love
We Wish for Our Daughters."
The book, based on a Michigan
bridal shop, was published in
December.
"His great talent was to find
stories that had heart that peo-
ple could relate to," Morris said.

LSAT
From Page 1A
tests administered for this year
is also on a steady decline, with
numbers for fall 2011 portraying
a 9.9-percent decrease from the
previous year.
Wendy Margolis, LSAT direc-
tor of communications, said fig-
ures reflect an ongoing national
trend of decreased law school
applications in the wake of dif-
ficult economic times across the
nation.
"With law school applications
there's a bit of a lag time, by the
time people take the LSAT and
by the time they apply," Margo-
lis said. "Right now they would
take the LSAT for the fall of 2012
- the information about the debt
and the job placement issues are
finally catching up."
Margolis said the growing
price of undergraduate tuition
nationwide has likely also played
a role in the decrease in LSATs
administered.
"I just think undergraduate
school is expensive as well, and
people are getting a lot of debt
from undergraduate school,"
Margolis said. "The thought of
piling on more debt when the job
picture isn't so rosy causes peo-
ple to hesitate more than they
might have otherwise."
Sarah Zearfoss, the Law
School's senior assistant dean
for admissions, financial aid and
career planning, wrote in an
e-mail that in light of a decrease
in LSATs administered, nation-
al application pools have also
decreased significantly.
"As I recall from the last time
I saw a volume report, the over-
all applicant pool has declined
nationally by almost 15% this

year- maybe even more," Zear-
foss wrote. "Last year's pool also
constricted."
While Zearfoss agreed that
the economy has played a sub-
stantial role in decreasing law
school applicants, she noted that
the interest in the University's
law school has remained high in
comparison to peer institutions.
"Yes, we at Michigan have
seen an (economic) effect, as one
would expect - I don't know of
any of our peers that haven't -
although our decline is, happily,
smaller than the overall national
average," Zearfoss wrote. "Our
application deadline is not for
another couple of weeks, but I
would estimate that our pool
will be about 5% smaller this
year than last."
Despite the likely decline,
Zearfoss remained optimistic
about the University's applicant
pool for this year.
"As a general proposition, of
course, admissions offices love
to see an abundant applicant
pool, but given that Michigan
typically has a very healthy vol-
ume of applicants, a decrease
in this size does not represent a
serious concern for us," Zearfoss
wrote. "We will have more than
5,000 applications this year, I
think."
Zearfoss explained that the
decrease in applicants cor-
responds with a "pretty pre-
dictable ebb and flow" in law
school interest over the past
two decades, in accordance with
economic downturns.
"The mid-90s saw a simi-
lar decrease, following the big
economic downturn of 1991-
92," Zearfoss wrote. "The most
recent recession and contrac-
tion in our national economy has
understandably made people

cautious about investing in a law
school degree. I would expect
that within another year or two,
we will start seeing a reversal in
the cycle, and application num-
bers will start climbing again."
Theresa Munaco, LSA Senior
and president of the Kappa
Alpha Pi Pre-Law Fraternity,
said the decrease in people tak-
ing the LSAT likely corresponds
to an upswing of students that
have decided to take a few years
after graduation before mak-
ing the decision to apply to law
school.
"I would say that about half
of the seniors (in Kappa Alpha
Pi) have already taken an LSAT
and a really fair number of them
are taking the LSAT right now
and going straight through,"
Munaco said. "But then there's
the other half that is kind of tak-
ing time trying to get a real work
experience before going."
Munaco said many students
delay law school to pursue oppor-
tunities for personal growth and
development in programs like
Teach for America, AmeriCorps
or the military. She added that
since LSAT scores are only valid
for up to five years, those who are
unsure about the decision to go to
law school will often hold off on
taking the exam.
The competitive nature of law
school admissions amid a sur-
plus of lawyers in the job market
is also discouraging for prospec-
tive law school applicants, she
said.
"I don't think there needs to
be as many law schools as there
are currently and I think part of
the issue is that recently, they
started pumping out law schools
to pump out lawyers and all of a
sudden the demand for lawyers
shriveled up," Munaco said.

Chris Dickinson chosen as
interim hospital director

Associate chief
medical officer to
begin new post on
April 5
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Following the recent retire-
ment announcement by Patri-
cia Warner, executive director
of the C.S. Mott Children's and
Von Voigtlander Women's Hos-
pital, the University of Michigan
Health System announced on
Thursday that officials have hired
an interim executive director,
effective April 5.
Chris Dickinson, who cur-
rently serves as an associate chief
medical officer, will be taking
over the position, and said he is
eager to continue working on the
challenges of accommodating the
expansion of the hospitals while
continuing to improve care.
"It's a big challenge - we've
got the new building to make sure
that it's working well, our volumes
are up, we're seeing more patients
thanwe ever anticipated," he said.
"With that comes some challeng-
es, but we're meeting those, and

it'll be interesting to see how that
growth happens."
When the hospital opened on
Dec 4, Dickinson served as the
faculty lead for the project, coor-
dinating the move from the old
buildings. He said his role as an
administrator assisting in the
opening of the hospitals last year
influenced his decision to accept
the position.
"For the kid who always used
to like to play with his Legos and
build things, this was fun," he
said.
Dickinson said his relation-
ships with physicians at the Uni-
versity hospital and across the
state helped bolster his qualifica-
tions for the job.
"I think I have an intimate
understanding of how the hos-
pital works. I spend a lot of time
in hospital operations," he said.
"I've worked in clinics all over
the state, so I have relationships
and the knowledge of what other
pediatricians are doing in the
state as well."
Warner, who is set to retire
April 4, also pointed to Dickin-
son's rapport with colleagues as a
sign of a successful leader
"Dr. Dickson represents the
physician members of our fac-
ulty very well," Warner said. "He

understands clinical practice, he
understands how to bring various
groups together around a chal-
lenge or an issue or an opportu-
nity, and he's a strong facilitator."
Warner, who appointed Dick-
inson to be the associate chief
medical officer for the hospitals
after she created the position in
2010, added that her experiences
working with him have been posi-
tive.
"I know Dr. Dickinson well in
many capacities, and have every
good reason to be confident this is
a very wise interim appointment,"
she said.
Though the national search for
a permanent executive director
for the hospital is still ongoing,
Dickinson said he will likely seek
to permanently obtain the posi-
tion in the future.
"A lot of people have asked
me (to become director) and the
answer is 'I think so,"' he said.
"That was one of the advantages
of having the interim tag. It'll
be a good trial run for me to see
whether this is something I want
to do long-term or not."
The UMHS has no deadline or
target date to hire a candidate,
UMHS spokeswoman Margarita
Wagerson wrote in an e-mail
interview.

without which Greece would
default on its mountain of debt
next month and likely leave
the eurozone - a scenario that
would further roil global mar-
kets.
Lawmakers voted 199-74 in
favor of the cutbacks, despite
strong dissent among the two
main coalition members. A total
37 lawmakers from the majority
Socialists and conservative New
Democracy party either voted
against the party line, abstained
or voted present.
Yesterday's clashes erupted
after more than 100,000 protest-
ers marched to the parliament
to rally against the drastic cuts,
which will ax one in five civil
service jobs and slash the mini-
mum wage by more than a fifth.
At least 45 businesses were
damaged by fire, including sev-
eral historic buildings, movie
theaters, banks and a cafeteria,
in the worst riot damage in Ath-
ens in years. Fifty police offi-
cers were injured and at least
55 protesters were hospitalized.
Forty-five suspected rioters
were arrested and a further 40
detained.
As the vote got under way
early today, Prime Minister
Lucas Papademos urged calm,
pointing to the country's dire
financial straits.
"Vandalism and destruction
have no place in a democracy and
will not be tolerated," Papadem-
os told Parliament. "I call on the
public to show calm. At these
crucial times, we do not have the
luxury of this type of protest. I
think everyone is aware of how
serious the situation is."
Since May 2010, Greece
has survived on a $145 billion
(eurolo billion) bailout from
its European partners and the
International Monetary Fund.
When that proved insufficient,
the new rescue package was
approved. The deal, which has
not yet been finalized, will be
combined with a massive bond
swap deal to write off half the
country's privately held debt.
But for both deals to materi-
alize, Greece had to persuade
its deeply skeptical creditors
that it has the will to implement
spending cuts and public sector
reforms that will end years of fis-
cal profligacy and tame gaping
budget deficits.
As protests raged yesterday,
demonstrators set bonfires in
front of parliament and dozens
of riot police formed lines to
keep them from making a run
on the building. Security forces
fired dozens of tear gas volleys at
rioters, who attacked them with
firebombs and chunks of marble
broken off the fronts of luxury
hotels, banks and department
stores.

No analysis can render
the 'best' TV show

T his is my third column
for The Michigan Daily,
which is particularly
important because "third"
things tend to be the best - the
third season
of "Buffy
the Vampire
Slayer," the
third sea-
son finale of
"Mad Men,"
the third
time the KAYLA
Charmed UPADHYAYA
Ones had
to vanquish
Cole. And for this special third
column, I'm going to tell you
all about the very best show on
television.
Spoiler Alert: There is no best
show on television. Well, maybe
there is and I'm just stuck in my
ways, but I've never felt com-
fortable declaring a single show
* as the best. Even when I break
it down into painstakingly spe-
cific categories, I can't reach a
conclusion - is "Breaking Bad"
really the Best Show That Uses
Crystal Meth As a Plot Device,
or is "Justified?"
I don't even like top-10 lists.
First of all, they operate under
the assumption that the person
or people creating them have
sampled everything there is to
sample. Otherwise, the judge-
ment wouldn't be fair, right?
I believe there are only three
people on this planet who watch
more TV than I: my dear friend
and aspiring television writer
LaToya Ferguson, my arch-neme-
sis and aspiring television writer
Nate Levy, and AV Club's Todd
VanDerWerff. I, however, do not
believe that the four of us - even
when factoring in our collectively
astronomical consumption of
television - could come up with a
* satisfactory top-10 list.
I suppose I should have
distinguished between the
terms "best" and "favorite"
upfront. Except that there isn't
a difference. When it comes
to television, there really isn't
a distinction between what
is "best" and what is the the
"favorite" of the person or
group labeling it as such. No
matter what that pretentious

Valentine's Day

deliver depth
By AKSHAY SETH
DailyArts Writer
Those idiotic romantic mov-
ies that make you want to burn
a pack of Hallmark greeting
cards are back
- a surefire
sign that Val-
entine's Day The Vow
fever is offi-
cially here. And At Quality 16
with it comes and Rave
the annual Screen Gems
rant about why
those godfor-
saken movies are so painfully
bad. Unsurprisingly, it has a lot
to do with formulaic, beaten-
down plotlines and a noticeably
lackluster brand of uninspired
acting.
You would think "The Vow"
- featuring a slightly interest-
ing plotline and directed by a
man who managed to squeeze a
decent performance out of Drew
Barrymore (Michael Sucsy,
"Grey Gardens") - wouldn't be
that bad. Sadly, that's not the
case. The star-studded drama

brings only one question to
mind: How in the world does
watching a load of crap steam
for 104 minutes make two peo-
ple in a relationship feel closer
together?
Sucsy doesn't waste any of
those minutes shoving us into the
meat ofthe story.As Paige (Rachel
McAdams, "The Notebook")
and her husband Leo (Chan-
ning Tatum, "G.I. Joe: The Rise
of Cobra") leave a movie theater
on a snowy winter night, they're
struck by an impulse to unbuckle
their seatbelts and kiss in the mid-
dle of the street. A few seconds
later, they're struck again - this
time by a large cargo truck that
sends Paige flying out of the wind-
shield with severe head trauma.
When Paige regains con-
sciousness in the hospital, it
turns out the last five years of
her life have been wiped from
her memory. She no longer
remembers Leo or ever getting
married to him. It's a sad story,
based on true events, that has
a lot of potential as a script.
Unfortunately, that potential is
never fully realized by the film-
makers. Instead of a heartbreak-
ing tale anchored by love and
reconciliation, we get nonsense
about Paige suddenly changing
political views and being wooed

by an old flame.
There's nothing special about
the two lead performances, but
they never manage to slip into
the territory of horrible, either.
McAdams and Tatum play their
parts plainly, almost seeming
relieved by the time the credits
roll. And to a certain degree, the
reason this film fails has noth-
ing to do with bad performances
or belabored script gimmicks.
It has to do with a director who
never manages to maintain an
even tone as the film progresses.
One minute, we're supposed to
be tearing up about how Paige
doesn't even recall where she met
her husband. A few seconds later,
we're being bombarded by stupid
jokes meant to lighten the mood.
There's no discernible consis-
tency in the directing, leaving
the audience unable to see a clear
point or message in the film.
And in all honesty, there
probablyisn't a point being made
here. At the end of the day, this
is nothing more than an attempt
at making money off of people
going to the movies for Valen-
tine's Day. And as long as those
people keep going, that hor-
rible cycle of mid-February crap
will continue to turn in years to
come, powered forward by fake
tears and phony love.

ALBUM REVIEW

DailyArts Writer
From the very first sound of
the album - a gutsy guitar chord
packed with an extra dose of
angsty twang

latest, Go Fly Go Fly aKite
A Kite, is going

four previous
major albums, most of which
follow a strict feel-good pop-
rock protocol. They were mere
hints at his folk roots, until he
created the latest (and not so
greatest) before Go Fly A Kite:
2009's Changing Horses, a foray
into country-soaked rock. Go

- Kweller has returned to rock,
but not without toting a hell of a

Kweller's finally back, this time
with his own label, The Noise

rock sounds a little muddled, but
the album proves that Kweller
and his music are insanely like-
able, so fans shouldn't be too dis-
appointed.
Back to that first guitar chord.
"Mean To Me" is tense, upbeat
and irritated right off the bat. A
harmony-driven melody makes
the song instantly listenable and
sets the stage for a lot more angst.
"Out The Door" is the first
track to deliver some of the
leftover twang from Chang-

soundtrack to arodeo, as Kweller
emphasizes his drawl, singing

FILM R VISW
'Pina' mesmerizes

Dance-based film
tribute captures
beauty in 3-D
By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer
Passion. Inspiration. Pain.
Longing. Such was the story
of Pina Bausch. And she told it
only one way -
through dance.
Other than the "
personal inter- Pina
views with
members of At the
Bausch's the- Michigan
ater company Sundance Selects
Tanztheater
Wuppertal,
there's nothing in "Pins" to sug-
gest that it's a documentary.
Instead, the film is a breathtaking
collage of Bausch's most famous
works, translated onto the screen
with love and admiration by her
dancers.
How else would you tell the
story of someone who told their
own story through dance? How
else do you portray the life of
someone who lived through their
art? The only way, the right way,
is to let their art do the talking.
And if a picture is worth a thou-
sand words, a dance is worth
more. That's how German direc-
tor Wim Wenders ("Palermo
Shooting") approached B'ausch's
life in "Pina."
A young woman flexes her
muscles, saying "I am strong."
There's pain in her eyes, and
she wants to prove her strength.
Then she relaxes. The man hid-
den behind her, who was actually
the one flexing his muscles, steps
out. The woman brings her hands
in front, embraces herself and
breaks into dance. She is strong
through her dance.
A few minutes later, another
womanperforms onsome strand-
ed rocks in a stream. She's sur-
rounded by the beauty of hills,

of trees, of nature. Out of the
river emerges a hippopotamus.
She dances for him atnd then to
him. She embraces the big, scary
animal. And through dance, she
overcomes fear and learns to love
the beast.
These inspirational perfor-
mances are the stories that make
up "Pina." They are the film
and its plot. However, they also
almost didn't make it to the sil-
ver screen. Bausch and Wenders
started collaborating on "Pina"
in 2009, only a few months
before Bausch's sudden death.
Wenders stopped production,
but resumed the project after
dancers of Tanztheater Wup-
pertal convinced him to make
the film.
The choice to shoot "Pina"
in 3-D was a strange one. At
first, it seems like there's noth-
ing in this film that needs to be
given an extra dimension. Until,
of course, one sees the dances.
These performances were origi-
nally designed for the sanctum of
Bausch's theater, and seeingthem
in 3-D is the only way to do their
potency justice. Here, Wenders
must be applauded for making
such a risky decision that pays off
beautifully on screen.
Wenders doesn't focus much
on the interviews, but the few he
manages to capture indicate that

the pieces the dancers are per-
forming are the ones that most
accurately tell Bausch's story.
After performing on the cross-
section of two busy roads, a danc-
er recalls Bausch watching her
from the sidelines: "It was like
Pina was living every moment
with her dancers, sometimes like
a child, full of all the feelings we
were having."
After dancing with the hip-
popotamus, another says "I even
identified her with this big, sweet
monster. All of her pieces were
about love and pain and beauty
and sorrow."
Wenders captures the most
important aspects of Bausch's
life - her dancers and the dances
she choreographed - with integ-
rity. By focusing solely on perfor-
mance, he ensures that Bausch's
passion and love for dance flow
through the movie undisturbed.
The soundtrack, strategically
implemented, adds even more
depth to the already dramatic
performances.
While caught up at times in
its own love affair with Bausch,
"Pina," with its beautiful chore-
ography and eye-catching cin-
ematography, is a mesmerizing
ode to the power of dance. It lives
and breathes by Bausch's motto:
"dance, dance, otherwise we are
all lost."

Michigan State: 3 ] Y1 j. J7 P Michigan State: 2

Lynch avoids benching, Wolverines salvage
. stars as overtime hero split with OT thriller

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
DETROIT - The man who
almostgot benched in overtime
shook off missing the goal he
should have scored, collected
the puck that never should have
reached him, and shot it into
the Spartan goal for the game
winner. Michigan 3, Michigan
State 2.
Kevin Lynch might have
played just five seconds of good
hockey on Saturday, but he did
it in the final five seconds, and
that's what matters.
But the junior forward
almost didn't get the chance.
"I can tell you, there were
times in the third period I
thought about not putting
him out in the overtime," said
Michigan coach Red Beren-
son. "That line got caught in
W their own zone and they got in
trouble. And I thought, I don't
know if I can trust them in the
overtime.
"I know that Kevin's had
a good record against Michi-

gan State. I know he's had a
good record at Joe Louis. They
got one shift in overtime, and
bingo. So you never know."
Here's how Lynch's roller-
coaster weekend went:
On Friday, he scored a goal
in Michigan's losing effort in
East Lansing, his first since the
finals of the Great Lakes Invi-
tational in December. Against
Michigan State. Before that,
Lynch hadn't scored since Dec.
9. Against Michigan State.
Notice a pattern? Four of
Lynch's six goals this season
have come against the Spar-
tans. The other two also came
against in-state teams: Western
Michigan and Northern Michi-
gan.
Call it the Kevin Lynch State
Stimulus Package.
"I've been fortunate to get
points when I play (Michigan
State)," said Lynch, a native of
Grosse Pointe, Mich. "It's just
that rivalry thatgets me going."
On Saturday, Lynch slashed
his finger open in warm-ups
while trying to clear snow off

his skates. The night got pro-
gressively worse from there.
Turnovers, poor defense and
an inability to get the puck out
of Michigan's zone plagued
Lynch's line in regulation.
The line, completed by soph-
omore forward Derek DeBlois
and the other Lynch - Travis,
a freshman forward --typically
creates few goal-scoringchanc-
es but plays a scrappy defensive
style. Saturday's game was
uncharacteristically sloppy,
and Berenson nearly sidelined
them for the overtime period.
Only Kevin Lynch's track
record stopped him.
Lynch's history in clutch
situations belies his role on
the team. He was expected to
be a scorer when he arrived at
Michigan, but has struggled to
consistently findthe back of the
net. Berenson said he has kept
his spot in the lineup because
he is a hard worker who,
because of his defensive effort,
remains a plus player.
"He knows it hasn't been the

DETROIT - There had to be
a sense of deja vu for the No. 4
Michigan hockey team.
Overtime against Michigan
State in Joe Louis Arena? Check.
Goal by a relatively quiet player -
in this case, junior forward Kevin
Lynch - to clinch the game?
Double check.
The Wolverines' 3-2 win over
the Spartans on Saturday was a
mirror image of the Great Lakes
Invitational back in December.
Luckily for the squad, it didn't
replicate too much from past
games against the Spartans -
notably, an abysmal penalty kill
that led Michigan (12-8-4 CCHA,
18-10-4 overall) to drop a 3-2
decision in East Lansing on Fri-
day night.
"I'd say the best thing about
our game was that we didn't
have to kill six penalties," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"The game was well-officiated,
the players played within them-
selves."

Michigan struck first on Sat-
urday, when junior forward A.J.
Treais scored his fifth goal in as
many games. His initial shot on
Spartan netminder Will Yanakeff
rebounded off of the goalie's
pads, but Treais collected the
puck and fired a backhand to find
the back of the net.
After Michigan State (11-10-3,
16-12-4) found the equalizer early
in the second frame, the Wolver-
ines' penalty-kill unit found itself
in trouble again.
When freshman forward Zach
Hyman took a hooking penalty,
the Spartans capitalized on their
man advantage in less than a min-
ute. Working the puck around the
crease, Brett Perlini fired a wris-
ter on fifth-year senior goalten-
der Shawn Hunwick's glove side
and into the goal.
Not the kind of thing Berenson
wanted to see.
"In the games we've lost this
season, penalties have been the
cause of that," said junior for-
ward Kevin Lynch. "(Berenson)
said, 'Limit the penalties tonight,
we'll win the game.'"

Michigan listened. Treais
went on to knot the game with a
wrister from the top of the circle,
and both teams went 30 minutes
without sending a player to the
sin bin.
But with six minutes left in the
final stanza, sophomore forward
Luke Moffatt went to the box for
hooking, giving the Spartans a
critical power play.
Just minutes before, Michigan
struggled to clear the puck from
its zone.
On this penalty, though, the
penalty-kill unit played much
more aggressively - senior for-
ward Luke Glendening cleared
the puck on rebound shots off
of Hunwick and junior forward
Kevin Lynch fought hard around
the point.
Hunwick is at the heart of every
penalty kill, and though he held
his own on Saturday, he was on the
receiving end of some very lucky
breaks. Shots hit the pipes or just
bounced the right way in his favor.
Berenson still sang Hunwick's
praises after the game.

weeks since I LLINOIS 61
any of those MICHIGAN 70
things were
the case, but Sunday's matchup
with Illinois switched things
around for the Wolverines.
The sophomore pair emerged

from their prolonged struggles
in the first half to give Michigan
(9-4 Big Ten, 19-7 overall) a 70-61
victory and a winning streak - its
first since early January.
When redshirt sophomore
center Jordan Morgan fled for
the bench after picking up two
early fouls, Smotrycz stepped in
and saw a rare stretch of extend-
ed minutes. Smotrycz made the
most of those first-half minutes,
putting up 12 points on 3-for-4
shooting and converting each of
his four free throw attempts.
"It was good to see some shots

go down finally," Smotrycz said.
"Guys had confidence in me."
With 7-foot-1 Fighting Illini
center Meyers Leonard also on
the bench due to first-half foul
trouble, Smotrycz saw little resis-
tance, caught fire and buried two
3-pointers to help Michigan to a
37-31 halftime lead.
"He's a big guy inside, takes
up a lot of space," Smotrycz said
of Leonard. "We had trouble
reboundingwith him in the game,
so it definitely helped - him get-
ting in foul trouble. At the same
time, I thought we did a fairly

good job when he was on the floor
of limiting his touches."
Hardaway also experienced a
180-degree turnabout from his
recent performances. His ten
first-half points matched his out-
put from the last two games com-
bined. Though he was quiet in
the second half, he wasn't forcing
shots like he had been in recent
weeks. He finished with a team-
high 15 points and was one of four
Wolverines to score in double dig-
its.
"I didn't show emotion, but I
was very happy inside," Hard-

away said about making his first
3-pointer since a Feb. 1 victory
against Indiana. "Just seeing
that one go in, I made sure on the
second one I tried to do the same
thing as I did when I shot the first
one and not rush anything."
Added Illinois coach Bruce
Weber: "When your two worst
3-point shooters go 4-for-4 -
Hardaway and Smotrycz - in the
first half, it's a killer. They have so
many other weapons, they spread
you out, but good teams make
plays."
After Leonard scored four

points out of the gate to give the
Illini an early lead, the Wolver-
ines held the sophomore in check.
They pushed him out of the post
and hounded him with double
teams to force Illinois out on the
perimeter. Leonard was held to a
single point in the last 38 minutes
of play on 0-for-3 shooting.
The Illini (5-7, 16-9) led in the
early minutes and took a brief
20-19 lead midway through the
first half, but a 13-3 run put Mich-
igan in the driver's seat, a position
it would not relinquish the rest

Humble beginnings

PONTIAC, Mich. -
February 12, 2012 was a Sunday. The
sky was a beautiful light blue, and
in the morning, the sun hid behind
clouds that appeared white and spindly
or gray and heavy, depending on how you
looked at them. The roads around Ann
Arbor had a frozen-
white hue - winter -
had finally erased
all memories of an
unseasonably pleasant-
season.
It was the kind of
day you'd like to enjoy
indoors. Yet, my car TIM
hurried along M-14
in the mid-morning, ROHAN
surrounded by snow
banks, with three
companions in tow. We were prepar-
ing ourselves to observe and chronicle a
mystery - our own mythical journey, like
striking out for the Fountain of Youth or
El Dorado - in the first-ever Michigan
varsity lacrosse match.
I had never seen lacrosse played in my
life, but I took comfort that my uneasiness
and curiosity must've been shared by the
handful of brave souls who first watched
Michigan play the new and strange sport
of football in 1879.
I asked the others - two sportswrit-
ers and photographer - for help with
the rules. Theo, a tall and confident New
Yorker, had only watched lacrosse a few
times on TV and had caught not more
than five minutes' worth. Evan, a quiet
and thoughtful gentleman from North
Carolina, covered Michigan's exhibi-
tion match the week prior, and still, he
couldn't help. Our photographer, Adam,
a kind freshman from Seattle, said he
watched his younger'brother play for
years; Adam couldn't explain the rules
either.
I dropped the subject and worried
aloud, asking if they knew if the game
would be played outside. The thought
frightened the passengers, who were just
as in the dark as I was.
Matt Trevor, who's in charge of the
lacrosse team's media relations, poked
fun when I asked him where the field was
located.
"Outdoors," he texted me. "We have
special snowshoes."
The sinking feeling in the pit of my
stomach went away when he said he was
joking.
I, for one, didn't know what to expect.
Off the highway, we passed a boarded-
up elementary school and the ruins of
an industrial factory that surely once
boomed with electricity. Then, like an
oasis in the desert, the trio of connected
field houses comprising the Ultimate Soc-
cer Arenas came into view.
A sign out front flashed: "UDM/UM,
Sold Out."
Inside, on two of the fields, boys no
older than 14 played lacrosse, while par-
ents watched or gossiped with others. The
Michigan lacrosse team warmed up oppo-
site the Detroit Titans, the home team
and villain in this origin tale.
Except for a few Detroit flags, the
building was as unassuming as its bland
exterior. The crowd was a smattering
of parents, families, friends and a few
lacrosse enthusiasts. I counted less than
10 maize shirts, and not many Michigan
students - a group of four said they made
the hour-long trip to Pontiac to see their
friends play.
The announced attendance was 1,800,
but that count didn't include a father who
didn't have a ticket and convinced a secu-
rity guard to let him in with the press to
watch his son play for Michigan.
Two-by-two, the Michigan lacrosse
team filed onto the field. They wore the
famed winged helmets and their jerseys
were maize with white trim and blue let-
tering.

They wore plain white Adidas socks,
plenty of padding and cleats.
Their left sleeves read: "ECAC," rep-
resenting the Eastern College Athletic
Conference, which boasts the University
of Denver as its reigning champion, and
which the newly birthed Michigan varsity
team will join as a full-fledged member
in 2013.
They had used a conference room, its
chairs still set up, as a makeshift locker
room, with their duffel bags set against
the walls.
Then they walked past the cooler sell-
ing $3.25 beers. There was no band to
greet these Wolverines, no cheerleaders
or student section.
Opposite a Michigan team that won
three-straight club national titles from
2008-10 stood Detroit, who finished 6-10
last season and was a pre-season pick to
win its conference.
But the Titans had already lost to No.
19 Delaware and Ohio State by a combined
score of 30-12.
Lined up for the national anthem, the
Michigan Men didn't look like the ste-
reotype. Far from physically imposing or
impressive, this was a mostly longhaired
and scruffy bunch.
Michigan's coach, John Paul, who had

labored as coach of the club team for 14
brilliant seasons, started four seniors:
Brian Greiner, Austin Swaney, Robert
Healy and Trevor Yealy, who I was told
was the best player on the team. It seemed
a fitting reward for being among the trail-
blazers.
A chaotic opening faceoff gave way to
a melodic, calm game of keep away - six
Michigan players passed the ball around
the perimeter. At first, the coaches con-
stantly yelled instructions and the play-
ers' communication could be heard over
the hushed conversation of the crowd.
It was clear - even to the most unedu-
cated - that Detroit played at a break-
neck pace. They tried to force the issue
with pressure on defense and sprint for
easy chances on offense. Michigan, mean-
while, was content holding onto the ball
for as long as it could. All day, the two
would clash.
Like all stories, this day had its heroes.
Doug Bryant - a 6-foot-1, broad-shoul-
dered sophomore midfielder from Princ-
eton, N.J. - scored Michigan's first-ever
goal five minutes into the first quarter.
The Wolverines erupted.
I had missed it while looking down and
taking notes, so I asked the man standing
next to me if he could describe it, and he
said: "I actually didn't even notice. I don't
know much about lacrosse."
Bryant had my undivided attention a
few minutes later, when he whipped a
shoulder-high shot and beat the goalie
from about 20 yards out.
Before the first quarter ended, Detroit
had tied the game thanks to two impres-
sive feats by Titan attacker Joel Mat-
thews. He swerved his way through
Michigan's defense for an easy look, then
matched Bryant with his own long-dis-
tance laser.
Yealy, whose jersey hung off looser
than most players, made two plays to keep
pace. The first was acrobatic - catching
a pass and shooting mid-air - while the
other used a smooth fake at close range
for a rare, easy goal. 4-2, Michigan.
That was the most elated the Wolver-
ines would feel on this day.
At halftime, Theo commented how easy
it was to lose track of who had the ball if
you weren't paying close attention.
Three kids ran out onto the field and
took turns taking shots on net. About
three-dozen fans had begun sitting down,
Indian style, near midfield to get a better
view.
Humble beginnings.
Detroit's tempo made for beautiful
highlight-reel goals, including three
unanswered and two in the span of five
seconds, soon after Yealy's brief outburst.
The buzz on Michigan's sidelines died.
The Titans added five more in a dominant
third quarter, and outscored the Wol-
verines, 3-2, in the fourth. Incessantly
- much like how it must sound for oppo-
nents at Michigan Stadium - Detroit's
fight song blared from two party-like
speakers after each goal.
After a mid-fourth-quarter goal, one
coach kicked a cone. One player paced
on the sideline, holding his arms over
his head. One player shouted, "Don't quit
Blue. Let's go!"
No one said a word.
The final score was 13-9, and Paul
wouldn't give in to the many readily avail-
able excuses. Fatigue may have been a fac-
tor; he had started a formerly third-string,
walk-on goalie - 5-foot-7 sophomore
Dylan Westerfield - due to piling injuries;
and he had suspended "key players" as
part of Paul's "culture building."
He did admit that Detroit's experience
was a distinct advantage over Michigan's
eight-and-a-half-months-old program.
"It's a huge factor - every single day,
every week, there's a big learning curve
for us," Paul said.
It didn't help that Michigan, who
Paul said had to be a possession-team,

was playing "as hard a team to possess
against in Division-I lacrosse" because of
Detroit's pressing style.
Paul called the third quarter "rough,"
and Yealy said the team's mental mistakes
- usually turnovers that led to fast breaks
- started to multiply.
"Mentally, we fell apart," Yealy said.
"(Detroit) came out at half still calm, and
they weren't freaking out that it was a
close game."
Paul had told them after the game,
gathered in the "Meeting Room," that
their mistakes were fixable: "We can play
better. We can play smarter."
They had to start somewhere.
Bryant said it was a "huge, huge honor,"
to score Michigan's first-ever goal.
"It was fun to play in," Yealy said. "I
will never forget this game - even though
it wasn't the outcome we wanted."
When the match was over, the only two
Division-I lacrosse teams in the state of
Michigan lined up to shake hands.
"Good luck this season, boys," said the
Detroit players, as if they knew best the
new and strange journey Michigan had
just embarked on.

For the Daily Detroit squad.

PONTIAC, Mich. - The Michigan
lacrosse team initiated another vol-
ume to the encyclopedia of Wolver-
ines' athletics with their inaugural
match against Detroit Mercy on Sun-
day. The Wolverines played in front of
a packed house in the first collegiate
varsity lacrosse match between two
in-state teams in Michigan history.
Michigan showed both its inex-
perience and its promise with a 13-9
loss, as the team was unable to answer
when Detroit pulled away with a flur-
ry of unanswered goals in the third
quarter.
Ultimately, it was inexperience
that plagued the newly minted squad.
Michigan committed a few cost-
ly turnovers that sparked Detroit's
third-quarter run, failing to slow the
game down or recover from their mis-
takes.
"Our defense let down a little bit
in the third quarter, but it wasn't just

"We are here
to become a
great lacrosse
program."
The Wolverine team, which was a
club team just a year ago, showed a
lack of mental toughness displayed by
more veteran teams.
"There is always this question in
your head: 'Are you ready for this?'
" Paul said. "Getting out there and
weathering the storm a bit defensively
and then putting that first goal in, that
goes a long way right there in giving
the guys confidence."
But Paul's team showed its grit in

the final minutes of the game. With
under four seconds to go, Detroit was
called for a penalty and the Wolver-
ines got possession just inside mid-
field. Instead of waiting for the final
horn, Michigan coaches continued to
yell instructions and the players con-
tinued to attack the defense.
"We have the attitude of no excus-
es," said sophomore midfielder Doug
Bryant, who scored the first two goals
in program history.
"We take things on a day-by-day
ha-.s ia:d look to get better every sin-
gle time we play."
Maintaining a positive attitude will
be essential for the Wolverines as they
try to build a program. The Wolver-
ines' performance showed that they
are a work in progress, but the team
showed it has some talent in its ranks.
"We are not always going to be
the most talented team in Division-I
lacrosse," Paul said. "We know that,
so we have to be the smartest team.
That's what we talked about after the
game. We can play better if we play
smarter."
Building a program can take years,
but Paul seems invested in making the
rookie program into a seasoned com-
petitor.
"We are not here just to be here,"
Paul said. "We are here to become a
great lacrosse program."

Bektas topples No. 2 Gullickson,
Michigan faces stiff competition

By ADAM FISHER
Daily Sports Writer
As the old adage goes: "To be the
best, you have to beat the best."
But it never said anything about
beating the best consistently. And
though Michigan fields one of the
elite collegiate women's tennis teams,
it too faltered in the face of three top-
15 opponents in three days.
The No.10 Michigan team began its
run in the 2012 National ITA Women's
Team Indoor Championships with a
4-0 shutout win on Friday over No.
15 Clemson at The Boars Head Sports
Club in Charlottesville, Va.
After easily clinching the doubles
point, the Wolverines won three
consecutive matches, behind the
racquets of freshman Emina Bektas,
junior Mimi Nguyen, and freshman
Sarah Lee, who played at the No. 1,
No. 3, and No. 4 singles spots, respec-
tively. The three players who had not
yet finished their singles matches had
their matches abandoned after Michi-
gan earned the decisive fourth point.
"Clemson's a team that's very
solid," said Michigan coach Ronni
Bernstein. "That was a really good
win for us."
The following day, though, No.
3 Duke turned the story around on
Michigan. The No. 1 doubles team

of Bektas and sophomore Brooke
Bolender won its opening match, but
it wasn't enough. The top-seeded Blue
Devils prevailed in every other facet
of play, winning the remaining two
doubles matches as well as the first
three singles matches.
Just like on the previous day, three
Wolverines were stranded on the
court - but this time, after being
handed a 4-0 shutout loss.
"Against Duke, we fell a bit flat,"
Bernstein said. "We definitely did not
play our best."
The loss spoiled Michigan's aspira-
tions to go further in the main draw of
the tournament, but the Wolverines
were matched against No. 6 Georgia
in consolation play on Sunday. Once
again, the duo of Bektas and Bolender
won its opening doubles match, 8-2,
but the Bulldogs won the other two
doubles matches to take the point.
Then, Lee, who has not dropped a
singles match this season, defeated
her singles opponent in straight sets,
6-1, 6-1.
Deadlocked at one, the Wolverines
pulled ahead when Bektas defeated
the nation's No. 2 collegiate player,
Chelsey Gullickson, in straight sets,
6-2, 7-5. With the victory, Bektas
maintained her perfect singles record.
"She lost to (Gullickson) in the fall,
so that shows improvement," Bern-

stein said. "It's a big win for Emina.
She's getting more and more con-
fidence in herself. She sees herself
coming through, and today it went to
a tiebreaker in the second set and she
was able to pull it out. We look for-
ward to her doing that even more."
But once again, it wasn't enough.
Georgia rallied to win the four
remaining singles matches to emerge
with a 5-2 victory, ending Michigan's
ITA indoor journey.
"Obviously, you're not happy with a
loss (against Georgia), but I think we
did a good job today setting ourselves
in position to win the match," Bern-
stein said. "We just came up a little bit
short."
"I think (our performance was)
positive - it's an extremely tough
weekend," she added. "We're play-
ing Duke and Georgia. Duke's a top
five team. I think Georgia could be as
well."
Next Wednesday, the Wolverines
will head to East Lansing to take on
Michigan State.
"We're gonna take a couple days
off," Bernstein said. "I think that's
what we need right now. We've had
a tough stretch here. This weekend's
pretty physical with three matches,
so it'll be a good week and a half that
we can just come back home and get
ready for Michigan State."

Red-hot Treais
trouble for MSU

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
The Michigan hockey team has posted a 19-4 record at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit during the last five seasons.
M m akes th e Joe Yost East'

DETROIT -
The lights go off, the
crowd gets loud, and a
man with a Zorro mask
skates around the ice as spot-
lights twirl for player introduc-
tions.
During
the game,
checks deliv-
ered on the
boards rattle
the glass
just a little
more than
usual, and EVERETT
the piped-in COOK
music is just
a little louder.
When junior forward Kevin
Lynch flipped in the game-win-
ning goal less than two minutcs
into overtime, the crowd noise
rose to decibel levels that are
impossible to achieve in the
Wolverines' regular home.
Yost Ice Arena might be one
of the best places to watch a
college hockey game in the
country, but it's not Joe Louis
Arena. The Joe is an entirely
different animal. I realized this
at some point before I walked
up what felt like 10,000 stairs
to get to the press box - with
two Coney dogs from Lafayette
Coney Island in my belly, none-
theless - and at some point
after I got lost trying to find
the door back to the stairwell,
which was marked with some
very helpful signs that said "Do
Not Enter."
There is something about that
arena that feeds the psyche of
the Wolverines. It could be that
SPLIT
From Page 1B
"Hunwick was bigger than
life," Berenson said. "Let's face
it, he wasn't very big, but he
played like he was big."
Killing the penalty at the
end of the game keyed a huge
momentum swing. But it seemed
even bigger because of how thel
unit had performed the night
before. Before the Spartans' sec-
ond goal on Friday, the Wolver-l
ines had killed 26 consecutive
penalties. By the end of Friday'sl
game, they had surrendered two
power-play goals.1
After a scoreless first frameI
in that contest, Michigan took a
two-goal lead thanks to Treais
and Lynch, but Michigan State]
kept creating scoring opportu-
nities. It eventually paid off fort
them. A slapshot from the top of

the arena feels like it was built
exclusively for people under
6-feet-tall, so fifth-year senior
goaltender Shawn Hunwick
feels right at home.
It could be that Michigan
coach Red Berenson likes coach-
ing in an arena that was built the
year after he retired from his
17-season NHL career, remind-
ing him of the glory days.
Or maybe it's that the Wolver-
ines look up to the rafters and
see NHL championship banner
after championship banner as
they skate on the same ice that
some of the best hockey players
in the world have skated on for
the last 32 years.
Whatever the reason, Michi-
gan doesn't mess around in
Detroit. Over the last five sea-
sons, Michigan is 19-4 at the
Joe. 19-4 against high-level
competition. That's not good -
that's legendary.
On Saturday, the game very
easily could have gone Michi-
gan State's way. Both teams
had great looks they couldn't
finish in the last 10 minutes of
the third period, where a lucky
bounce one way or the other
could've decided the outcome.
In overtime, Michigan won
because a Spartan whiffed
at blocking the puck, leaving
Lynch with a wide-open look
to end it. Two months earlier,
sophomore defenseman Kevin
Clare ended the Great Lakes
Invitational from almost the
exact same spot on the opposite
side of the ice.
Luck of the Joe, I guess.
Or maybe it's more than that.
the circle midway through the
second period cut the Wolver-
ines' lead in half.
Then came the slew of penal-
ties, starting at the beginning of
the third period.
It only took Michigan State's
Torey Krug one minute to capi-
talize on a boarding penalty and
fire a slapshot past Hunwick.
Another one followed three
minutes later. It was difficult for
Berenson to hold in his frustra-
tion at the end of the game.
"Our team was not good,"
Berenson said bluntly. "You
can't take penalties. You can't
keep taking penalties."
But Berenson's stern talk with
the team about playing short-
handed paid off - he was all
smiles after winning at the Joe.
"I think we were good,"
Berenson said. "I liked our ...
spirit (and) work ethic, and I
thought we were generating
something." F

The building fits Michigan's
style of play - an old-school
brand of hockey that favors
defense and opportunistic scor-
ing over flashy offensive for-
wards and 5-4 wins.
Michigan won't have a
20-goal scorer this season.
There's not one flashy name.
When the Joe's speakers play
Avicii, it feels like that scene
in Back to Future when Marty
McFly rips a guitar solo at prom
in the 1950s - the music doesn't
match the surroundings.
Michigan probably won't
have an All-American skater
this season. The Joe is one of
three professional hockey are-
nas in the country that doesn't
have a corporate-sponsored
name, instead using the name of
the boxing legend.
Michigan's best player is a
5-foot-6 former walk-on who
was told he wouldn't play at the
beginning of his career, only to
be well on his way to becom-
ing one of the best goalies in
Michigan history. The Joe has
ridiculous press box seating
that makes me feel like Gulliver
among the Lilliputians.
Maybe that's why Michigan
is so successful at the Joe, the
throwback program in the
throwback building. 19-4 in the
last five years doesn't happen by
accident.
It wasn't hard to imagine the
game on Saturday being played
in 1980 - that's the beauty of the
Joe. Even if I didn't fit.

DETROIT - Ever since
Michigan coach Red Beren-
son decided to throw fresh-
man Alex Guptill, junior
Chris Brown and senior
David Wohlberg on a line
together during the team's
trip to Alaska in December,
their prolific scoring has
powered the offense.
Michigan traveled 4,000
miles to find the formula for
its best line, but it took a far
shorter trip to find its sniper.
That top line should have
no qualms sharing the work-
load during the stretch run.
With just four regular-sea-
son games remaining, junior
forward A.J. Treais has
answered the call, providing
depth as a sharpshooter.
"We had one line going
before, and now A.J.'s line is
going, and that really helps
our team," Berenson said.
Treais is flanked on the
left by one of the team's ris-
ing stars in freshman Phil Di
Giuseppe and is joined on the
right by Michigan's leader,
captain Luke Glendening.
Instead of getting lost in the
shuffle, Treais has stood out
by, well, playing like himself.
"A.J. - he's really start-
ing to be A.J.," Berenson
said. "And that's huge for our
team. He's scoring key goals."
The two he scored against
Michigan State at Joe Louis
Arena on Saturday night
helped propel the Wolverines
to a 3-2 overtime victory.
And Treais's areaof opera-
tion has expanded in the
past five games, a span dur-
ing which he has notched
six goals. His tallies are no
longer just the blue-collar
type, where he fools goal-
tenders from the crease. He's
still earning those goals,
but Treais has also become
quite the sniper for Michi-
gan, to the point that oppos-
ing coaches break a sweat at
the sight of him between the
circles.
"He played too well,"
Michigan State coach Tom
Anastos said of Treais.
"Obviously, he scored some

nice goals for them, and we
didn't do a good enough job
of containing him."
His first tally against the
Spartans in Detroit was
exactlythe type that Treais is
used to scoring. After hisshot
from the slot was deflected
by Spartan netminder Will
Yanakeff, Treais's eyes wid-
ened to the size of pucks. The
rebound was a backhand flip
away from resting comfort-
ably in the net, and Treais
had no problem sticking it
through. It wasn't a high-
light-reel goal, but worked.
In the second period,
Glendening started an odd-
man rush, with Treais just
strides behind. The captain
fired off a no-look pass that
Treais seemed to be expect-
ing - justanother example of
the chemistry the second line
has developed. Treais made
his way into the slot and fired
off a quick snapshot that beat
Yanakeff wide.
In Michigan's 3-2 loss
to the Spartans on Friday,
the Wolverines had a simi-
lar opportunity, with Di
Giuseppe replacing Glenden-
ing as Treais' running mate.
Treais waited back while
Di Giuseppe weighed his
options. The shooting win-
dow did close, butthe passing
lane, as Treais said, was open
for Di Giuseppe to cross to
Treais, leading to aone-timer
snipe that found twine.
Treais, a Bloomfield Hills,
Mich. native, wears his heart
on his sleeve when playing
against the in-state rivals,
some of whom he grew up
facing in youth hockey. His
mannerisms after the game
said it all. After Friday's loss,
Treais didn't look up from
the ground, visibly upset
that his team let a two-goal
advantage slip away.
"The game's never out of
reach, especially in a rivalry
game against State," Treais
mumbled after the loss.
After the win on the Red
Wings' home ice, he was all
smiles. But Treais acknowl-
edged how easily the win -
and the three "huge" league
points that came with it -
could have eluded Michigan.

of the way. The Wolverine lead
straddled double digits during
the second half and Weber's team
wasn't able to threaten that lead.
Though guard Brandon Paul
tried to keep the Illini alive in the
final minutes, Michigan made its
free throws down the stretch to
shut the door.
Along with Smotrycz, junior
Matt Vogrich gave Michigan a
boost off the bench. After burying
three 3-pointers on Wednesday
against Nebraska, he drained two
more in the second half on Sun-
day.
The first came with just under
ten minutes left to add to the Wol-
verines a nine-point lead, and
the second came from the corner
to give Michigan a command-
ing 56-44 advantage. The Illinois

native finished with eight points.
"It's just a confidence thing,"
Vogrich said. "Making that first
one at Nebraska was huge, and
I just feel good shooting the ball
right now ... The rim just seems to
grow."
Added Beilein: "We get that
type of bench production, we can
keep winning at a pretty high
pace. We needed that.".
Sunday's victory gave Michi-
gan its 14th home victory in
as many tries. In the Big Ten,
only No. 11 Michigan State also
remains unbeaten at home. But
the next game should prove to
be the most difficult one yet. The
Wolverines host the third-ranked
team in the country on Saturday.
"We got a tough one on Satur-
day with Ohio State coming here,
and we're going to enjoy this
win," Hardaway said. "But in the
meantime, we all are thinking
about what happened when we
lost there."

4B - February 13, 2012

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Playing
Let's play agame of what if,
sticking strictly to hypo-
thetical scenarios. Let's say
it's Dec. 31, 2011 and the Michigan
basketball team has an imaginary
schedule with
just 12 games
on it.
What if
Tim Hard-
away Jr. sud-
denly couldn't
shoot? Just ,
for the sake
of it, let's say DANIEL
he shoots just WASSERMAN
23.1 percent
from 3-point
land in that 12-game stretch, and
not much better, 33.2 percent,
from the field.
What if Evan Smotrycz had
Stephen M. Ross-like money, but
even that wasn't enough to buy a
3-pointer? We can pretend he'll
shoot 30 3-pointers and only
make six of them, amounting to
an abominable 20 percent. And
what if; on top of all that, the
mythical 12 games included 11
teams from the nation's tough-
est conference, seven games on
the road - including contests
in Columbus, East Lansing and
Bloomington - and six games
against ranked foes.
What ifI told you that's what
the Wolverines and their fresh-
man point guard with no Big Ten
experience were up against in the
first 39 days of 2012?
If you told me that Michigan
would go 4-8 in that stretch, I'd
say the team might've been lucky
to win that many. When I tell you
that the Wolverines inexplicably
went 7-5, luck doesn't even cross
my mind. Michigan found itself
sitting just one game out of first
place in the Big Ten heading into
Sunday's matchup with Illinois.
And that's with the team's best
scorer, Hardaway Jr. shoot-
ing - and subsequently missing
- at exponential rates, and its
X-factor, Smotrycz turning into a
disappearing act.

ried the Wolverines through the
most grueling stretch of confer-
ence play - because the story of
this year's squad won't be written
in January or February. For the
last three years, Michigan's mea-
suring stick was just making the
NCAA Tournament, which came
via wins in the heart of winter.
This year's benchmark is differ-
ent. This team will be remem-
bered for what it does in March.
So what does a mid-February
game against the middling Fight-
ing Illini have to do with March?
"I don't know that I'm a sci-
entist at it, but we really try to
understand the season," Michi-
gan coach John Beilein quipped.
"(We) try to figure out what is the
best way for your team to be good
in February, because usually if
they're good in February, they're
going to be good in March."
Enter Smotrycz and Hardaway
Jr. Illinois opened up an early 8-7
lead at the 14:25 mark. But sec-
onds later, Hardaway Jr. convert-
ed on the ever-important first
3-point attempt of his afternoon.
And in the next three minutes,
Smotrycz netted five straight
points, including a 3-pointer that
also came on his first attempt.
It's amazing how high confidence
one's can soar when the first shot
goes down.

Suddenly, the two sophomores
- roommates, nonetheless -
couldn't miss. The two combined
to shoot 7-of-10 from the field in
the first half and hit each of their
four 3-pointers. Smotrycz had 12
first-half points, the most of any
player on the court, while Hard-
away Jr. added 10. Their 22 com-
bined points in the half exceeded
the 17 points the two had totaled,
together, in the previous two
games. And for the first time since
Dec. 29 - when Smotrycz had a
double-double and Hardaway tal-
lied 26 points - the sophomore
tandem led Michigan to a win.
Hardaway joked that his slump
this year was a case of finally hit-
ting the freshman wall that he
never encountered last year. With
Burke possibly hitting a fresh-
man wall of his own - granted,
the wall may only be knee-high
- Michigan needs Hardaway and
Smotrycz more than ever.
There's never a good time to
slump, but there is a good time
to break out of one. Sitting a
half game out of first place with
March right around the corner,
Hardaway and Smotrycz have
seemingly broken out at just the
right time.

center found himself constantly
harassed by double teams when
he got the ball in the post - and
that was if he managed to get
the ball in the post at all, since
the Wolverines worked hard to
front Leonard and prevent pass-
es from entering the paint.
Michigan also changed its
look several times, switching
from man-to-man to a 2-1-2 and
a 2-3 zone for a few possessions
in the second half and throw-
ing off the Illini's timing in the
process. The combination of
Morgan's and Smotrycz's indi-
vidual efforts and the constant
help kept Leonard from ever
getting comfortable, despite his
12 rebounds.
"Defense against somebody
like that goes beyond just posts
battling," Morgan said. "It's the
whole team. We need a lot of
help, we need a lot of pressure
on the ball, and we need every-
body to be locked in on what
we're trying to do as a team."
The Wolverines are used to
having to deal with a quality
frontcourt when playing Illi-
nois. For the past four seasons,
Michigan struggled to handle
the Fighting Illini trio of 6-foot-
9 Bill Cole, 6-foot-9 Mike Davis
and 7-foot-1 Mike Tisdale.
But this year's edition of Illi-
nois wasn't as imposing. Leon-
ard still has holes in his game
and doesn't have the same sur-
rounding talent as his predeces-
sors did. Fellow forward Tyler
Griffey did have a career-best
18 points, but he did most of his
damage from the perimeter.
Still, slowing down a pres-
ence like Leonard is a positive
sign for the Wolverines, who
know that opponents will con-
tinue to try to attack the paint
because of how thin Michigan
is at center.
"We had a lot of attention on
him," Beilein said. "To be hon-
est with you, we were very con-
cerned about him."
