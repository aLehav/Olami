The 
Washtenaw 
Housing 
Alliance and Shelter Association 
of Washtenaw County hosted 
the 
second-ever 
Voices 
of 
Homelessness 
event 
Friday 
evening in Ypsilanti, inviting 
community 
members 
to 
share their experiences with 
homelessness through art and 
storytelling.
A 
Washtenaw 
Housing 
Alliance 2018 report found 256 
people in the county live in 
shelters or transitional housing, 
while 28 people are completely 
unsheltered. 
The 
speak-out, 
which marked the beginning 
of National Homelessness and 
Hunger Awareness Week, was 
intended to spread awareness 
about homelessness and connect 
displaced people to resources.
Representatives from several 
housing 
and 
public 
health 
organizations, including Ozone 
House and Michigan Movement, 
attended 
Friday 
evening, 
distributing information about 
their efforts to support the 
local homeless population to a 
crowd of around 60. According 
to Eastern Michigan University 
student Olivia Harris, who works 
for the Shelter Association, the 
audience was composed of locals 
interested in the event as well as 
people currently experiencing 
homelessness.
“A lot of the agency members, 
we tried to put them out of the 
shelters, so there’s a homeless 

population here as well to get 
directed to resources, and there’s 
just a bunch of people from the 
community,” Harris said.
Following 
about 
half 
an 
hour 
of 
unstructured 
time 
during which attendees were 
encouraged to browse the art 
collection, 
Amanda 
Carlisle, 
executive 
director 
of 
the 
Washtenaw Housing Alliance, 
kicked 
off 
the 
evening 
by 
commending the work of the 
organizations contributing to 
Voices of Homelessness.

After Carlisle’s introduction, 
12 speakers, who were only 
identified by their first names, 
told their own stories about 
homelessness, explaining their 
backgrounds and sharing lessons 
and knowledge drawn from their 
experiences. Many of the stories 
included 
themes 
of 
mental 
illness and self-discovery. Other 
common 
sentiments 
among 
the speakers were frustration 
with the systemic issues that 
contribute to homelessness and 
a desire to combat the stigma 

surrounding homelessness.
The first speaker, Robin, 
explained how she moved to 
Michigan as a 12 year old after 
losing her family’s farm in 
Alabama. Though Robin’s aunt 
in Michigan promised them 
housing, they were forced to live 
in an unheated, bed bug-ridden 
van in the aunt’s backyard. 

Members of the University of 
Michigan chapter of J Street, an 
American advocacy group that 
promotes the efforts of “pro-
Israel, pro-peace Americans,” have 
published a petition to incorporate 
Palestinian 
perspectives 
into 
Birthright trips with University of 
Michigan Hillel.
Hillel is a global Jewish campus 
organization. As part of its mission 
to advocate for Jewish students, it 
runs Birthright trips during which 
young Jews can travel to Israel on a 
sponsored trip and learn about the 
state’s history and culture.
Jewish students made headlines 
this summer by walking off of 
birthright tour buses due to 
agendas and framing on the trip 
they saw as one-sided. 
LSA junior Meghann Norden-
Bright, the co-president of the 
University’s chapter of J Street, 
along with other leaders of the 
organization, gathered signatures 
after they heard feedback from 
Jewish 
community 
members.

University hosts second annual

HANNAH SIEGEL/Daily
Students from the University of Texas and the University of North Carolina speak about their experiences volunteering with Syrian refugees in Greece at the second 
annual Students Organize for Syria nation conference Friday.

Over the course of the second

national 
Students 
Organize for Syria conference, 
from Friday through Sunday 

at the University of Michigan, 
students and faculty from all over 
the country had the opportunity 
to listen to speakers, engage in 
discussions surrounding Syria 
and grapple with the primary 
question of the event: “Where do 
we go from here?”
In the course of the eight-
year-long civil war — which most 

watchdog organizations estimate 
has 
claimed 
about 
500,000 
lives — Syrian students have 
struggled with news of chemical 
attacks by the Assad regime, 
political inaction by the U.S. and 
other international actors and 
the resulting refugee crisis. 
With 
the 
last 
national 
conference hosted in Chicago, 

SOS National President Amal 
Rass, a senior at Wayne State 
University, was excited to have 
the 2018 conference at the 
University of Michigan.
“I’m just so happy to have this 
at U of M, for the conference to 
be hosted here,” Rass said. “I 
think it’s the perfect place to 

Last Tuesday, Michigan voters 
approved the passage of Proposal 
1, which will soon legalize the 
recreational use of marijuana in 
the state. Michigan became the 
first Midwestern state and the 
10th in the country to legalize 
cannabis, as the proposal won by a 
margin of 56 to 44 percent.
The proposal allows for adults 
aged 21 and older to purchase, 
possess and use marijuana; eat 
marijuana-infused edibles; and 
grow up to 12 marijuana plants 
in their homes for personal 
consumption. There will be a 
10-ounce limit for marijuana 
kept at residencies and any 

amount over 2.5 ounces must 
be kept in a locked container. 
While marijuana will most likely 
not be immediately available in 
commerical markets until early 
2020, a state licensing system will 
be created for local governments 
to monitor marijuana businesses, 
including growers, processors, 
transporters and retailers. State-
licensed retailers will be able to 
sell marijuana and other products.
The proposal will not go into 
effect until the vote count is 
certified by the state Board of 
Canvassers, which is projected 
to occur in the first weeks of 
December.

On Nov 3, owners Keith 
Orr 
and 
Martin 
Contreras 
announced Common Language 
Bookstore, one of about 10 
LGBTQ-oriented 
bookstores 
remaining in the U.S. and 
Canada, will close at the end 
of the year. Orr and Contreras 
have been together for 32 years 
and have owned the Kerrytown 
bookstore 
since 
2003. 
Community members lamented 
the loss of a gathering space.
Since its establishment in 
1991, Common Language has 
been a vital part of Ann Arbor’s 
LGBTQ community. When Kate 
Burkhardt and Lynden Kelly, 
Common Language’s former 
owners, decided to retire, Orr 
and Contreras were compelled 
to keep the bookstore alive.
“It’s an important part of gay 
culture,” Orr said. “Bookstores 
are where people a lot of times 
have their first time in a safe 
space to figure out who they 
are.”

have it, the students seem to 
be very passionate about these 
things and want to learn about. 
I’m happy we get to have it 
here.”
The 
weekend’s 
event 
consisted of a series of talks 
and 
discussions 
from 
13 
speakers, 
many 
of 
whom 
represented 
various 
Syrian 
activist organizations. Activist 
Shiyam 
Galyon, 
former 
director of the Books Not 
Bombs campaign that captured 
campus 
attention 
in 
2016, 
delievered 
the 
conference 
keynote Saturday morning— 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
speakers 
included representatives from 
the Syrian American Medican 
Society, 
Syrian 
Community 
Network, 
Syrian 
American 
Council 
and 
the 
Karam 
Foundation. 
Public 
Policy 
senior Zoha Qureshi, president 
of 
the 
University’s 
SOS 

chapter, said every speaker 
had an important message to 
share with the conference, 
but cited Loubna Mrie, a 
Syrian photojournalist, had an 
especially strong effect.
“Honestly, the lineup of 
speakers 
was 
incredible,” 

Qureshi said. “I’d say Loubna 
(Mrie) who spoke yesterday, 
she was a photographer on the 
front lines, her experiences 
were so raw and so personal 
and it just really struck a chord 
within me and I think she’s 
just phenomenal, but every 
other speaker had something 

really important to contribute. 
They’re just so phenomenal 
and I’m really glad they took 
the time this weekend to come 
and share their experiences 
and share their ideas on how 
we can make an impact.”
The 
event 
included 
10 
speaker sessions with topics 
ranging from policy, advocacy 
and lobbying to journalism 
in war zones, all of which 
addressed the future of the 
Syrian 
conflict. 
Many 
of 
the discussions began with 
presentations 
from 
each 
speaker before moving into a 
Q&A discussion with audience 
members. Qureshi said the 
Q&A 
allowed 
attendees 
to 
not only listen but actively 
participate with the speakers.
“I think it’s really important 
to 
have 
that 
engagement 
because if it’s just a bunch of 
lectures in a long span of time 
you kind of zone out and you 
lose track of what’s going on,” 
Qureshi said. “Just having that 
continuous conversation that’s 
really what makes things 
stick in people’s minds.”
Many 
attendees 
revealed they felt personal 
connections 
with 
the 
event speakers. LSA senior 
Ahmad Alabed, a member 
of the University’s SOS 
chapter, said the firsthand 
experiences of the activists 
allowed him to learn new 
information and see the 
Syrian conflict from a new 
point of view.
“I’m Syrian so I do have 
that firsthand experience 
from my family, but my 
family doesn’t live there,” 
Alabed said. “I hear from 
the people who live in the 
States, and I have my own 
opinion on what’s going on, 
but it’s very difficult to get 
an actual activist’s opinion 
who’s been there who’s 
been through things that 
these speakers have been 
through, and I think that’s 
really 
important. 
Just 
from the two speakers I’ve 
attended, it’s completely 
new information I’ve never 
had access to.”

Rackham 
student 
Hani 
Habra said he gained a new 
perspective from listening to 
the speakers, which provided 
him with a different way of 
learning 
about 
the 
Syrian 
situation.
“I do a lot of reading on the 
conflict, but actually meeting 
the people and hearing their 
perspective, it kind of gives 
a kind of different dimension 
to actually reading what they 
have to say. It feels a lot more 
real,” Habra said.
According to Rass, being 
surrounded by others who 
care about the conflict in Syria 
allows her to stay motivated 
and keep pushing to make an 
impact.
“This 
conference 
is 
important 
to 
me 
for 
two 
reasons,” Rass said. “One is 
that it helps me stay energized, 
passionate and also learning 
on how to keep organizing and 
moving forward and how we 
can keep doing work in these 
universities. The second part is 
being around people who share 
this passion is so important. 
Being around other Syrian 
Americans that care about this, 
even being around people who 
aren’t Syrian who are super 
passionate about this cause is 
an enriching experience that is 
super important to have.”
Through 
addressing 
solutions to the Syrian conflict, 
many 
speakers 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
raising 
awareness 
for 
the 
Syrian 
cause. 
Qureshi 
maintainted 
people nationwide and around 
the world should learn about 
and advocate for solutions to 
the Syrian conflict to encourage 
tangible change.
“It’s important to know that 
you don’t have to be Syrian to 
care about these issues, you 
just have to be human and 
have a heart,” Qureshi said. 
“Honestly, there’s just so many 
ways to make an impact that 
can be as little or big as you 
want it to be, I just want people 
to leave feeling empowered. 
Like Amal said, this has been 
going on for seven years, there’s 
still a lot to be done.”

It’s very difficult 
to get an actual 
activist’s opinion 
who’s been there


You’re American but you’re 

too Black.

You’re Black but you’re too 

African.

You’re African but you’re too 

dark.

I’m sick of being told what I 

am and what I am not.

You say I’m too much of that 

but not enough of this.

Just because my looks don’t 

fit your stereotyped definition 

of what I should be.

Who are you to tell me who I 

should be.

Whoever gave you the right to 

put me in a box anyway.

You sort, prioritize, and fixate 

on the different parts of me.

You think you can strip me 

down until I’m no longer whole.

You fail to realize those 

disparate 
pieces 
of 
me 
fit 

together to make me me.

They’ve 
so 
specifically 

shaped my worldview.

With every experience one 

piece stands out from the rest

But you don’t see that.

You can only see the most 

salient piece of me.

And that’s the piece you 

decide to label me as.

Your lens is so narrow you 

think 
my 
being 
one 
thing 

automatically 
makes 
me 

something else.

You 
fail 
to 
see 
the 

intersections that make me 

more than just one thing.

No one is just one thing.

I am a scholar, visionary, and 

advocate.

A writer and student.

I am a fashionista and lover of 

the finer things in life.

A wonderer and loyal friend.

I am adventurous, curious, 

and a little unpredictable.

Intelligent and still manage 

to make a fool of myself.

I am brave yet still afraid.

Because I know you watch my 

every steps in dismay.

Just waiting for me to slip 

up and prove to you that I am 

nothing more than a mistake.

That you can erase several 

bullets at a time.

So everyday while you put on 

your vest to protect yourself

From my just living life, trying 

to do me, ever so freighting to 

you self

I put on a smile, wear school 

apparel, avoid dark hoodies, and 

keep my hands where you can 

see them

In hopes that your loaded gun 

doesn’t see my dark skin as a 

threat.

To the Black men I love and 

have never met, I see you.

I saw this tweet today.

“a young Black man was 

LYNCHED. yes, in America. yes, 

in 2018. yes, for real. no, it wasn’t 

covered by the media. no, it’s not 

trending on Twitter. no, it wasn’t 

an accident. SAY HIS NAME: 

DANYE JONES. SAY HIS NAME: 

DANYE JONES. SAY HIS NAME: 

DANYE JONES.”

I’m struggling to put into words 

or writing what I think about this. 

The words, along with the image 

that I didn’t see of Danye’s body, 

float around in my mind. I am 

unable to grasp any of them. Danye 

Jones, the son of a prominent 

Black activist in Ferguson, Mo., 

was found hanging from a tree 

in his mother’s backyard. I am 

both surprised and not surprised 

that something as horrible as this 

has happened. Just the other day 

two Black people were shot in 

a grocery store, just because they 

were Black. The killer said to a 

white man who stood up to him 

that he didn’t have to worry about 

getting killed because “whites 

don’t kill whites.” What?

So now I have one more thing 

to think about when I’m in a 

public space and white people are 

present.

Am I just a person, or am I a 

target that day?

Now, I have a lynching to add 

into my internal list of reasons to 

feel uneasy in public. I thought … I 

don’t know what I thought.

I just never thought I’d read 

about someone being lynched 

today. That’s a piece of news that 

I never thought would be current 

in my lifetime. However, a small 

part of me feared something like 

this could happen after the 2016 

presidential election, but a bigger 

part of me thought things could 

never get this bad.

At the people who voted for 

Donald Trump: Yes, I’m still mad 

at you. Why? Because you gave 

someone power who didn’t need 

it. His power and support of white 

supremacists has brought these 

people into the light in a way 

where they don’t feel exposed, 

they just feel accepted and 

empowered. Instead of allowing 

them to be the ones with fear, you 

have brought new fears to me. 

On some days it feels silly to even 

worry about how my race may 

affect my safety; yet on others, it’s 

a prominent thought.

Do you, Trump Voter, ever 

have to experience any days like 

this? My guess is no. What are the 

reasons people gave to explain 

why you guys voted that way? 

You were poor??? That was your 

reason for letting this happen? 

Self-interest? Oh wait, no — 

maybe you weren’t poor. Maybe 

you were in business, and despite 

literally any single negative fact 

about Trump, you thought voting 

for him was a good decision. 

You rejoiced at the end of the 

night during the 2016 election 

when your man, your white 

supremacist, your sexist, your 

rapist in chief, Donald J. Trump, 

won the 2016 election.

But what exactly did you think 

it would lead to?

Did you think it would lead to 

a lynching?

I did.

“Oh but that’s ridiculous, there’s 

checks and balances for this kind 

of thing. You don’t need to worry. 

He won’t get out of hand.” Is 

that really true? What about the 

people who feel empowered by 

him? Who’s keeping any of those 

people in check? Does it matter 

to you, Trump Voter, what I’m 

going through? What any person 

in the United States who is not a 

Brad or Chad is going through? 

Does it matter to you, 53 percent 

of white women who voted for 

Trump, the news I read today 

about Danye Jones’ lynching? 

Your identity as women will 

come with oppression, but your 

whiteness brings a relative sense 

of security that I don’t have. What 

do you think about when you 

hear that information? A part of 

me sinks every time I hear about 

another Black person being killed 

in the news. There are times when 

I have to take a break from the 

news because I can’t keep seeing 

over and over that no matter how 

many times we insist that it does, 

my life does not matter.

But how do you react? Do you 

care?

Do you revel in this information, 

appearing to care online yet 

silently smiling to yourself when 

you read the headlines? Do you 

outwardly proclaim your hate for 

anyone who isn’t white? Are you 

happy? Was it worth this? Was 

protecting … essentially nothing, 

honestly, more important than 

Danye Jones’ life? To you it was. 

And you are to blame. Did you 

hang anyone? No.

But you did.

Almost a week ago, in an 

assignment for my screenwriting 

class, each student had to post 

two ideas and two comments on 

the class Canvas page for a short 

script that we hoped to write. My 

class is overwhelmingly white 

and male and so, just to shake the 

table a bit, I made one of my ideas 

the almost autobiographical tale 

of a burnt-out grad and her gay 

part-Black best friend. It would, I 

hoped, in an ambitious 10 pages, 

cover the questions of success, 

failure and identity, but frankly, 

aside from the extensiveness 

of the plot, I had doubts about 

posting the idea at all. Mostly, I 

was afraid, especially as the sole 

Black person in my class (I’m one 

of at most four Black people in 

ALL of my classes this semester), 

to be the person who makes it 

all about race. Yet everything is 

about race — a fact of which I 

would soon be reminded as I 

completed the task.

As I scrolled through everyone 

else’s idea posts, looking for a 

place to leave my remarks, I came 

across one of my classmates’ 

submissions and stopped scrolling 

instinctively, guffawing. When 

a 
Black 
frontierswoman 
is 

terrorized 
by 
ex-Confederate 

soldiers in the Wild West, began 

the student, whom we can call 

Justin for now, she must choose 

between fleeing or fighting alone. 

Objectively, I didn’t have an issue 

with the script, except for the 

fact that Justin is a white male. 

Subjectively, I wondered aloud, 

again, why people wrote from 

perspectives they didn’t know. 

Now, this isn’t to say that writing 

from any identity outside of your 

own is off-limits — it isn’t. But 

when I realized Justin would 

most likely be using the n-word in 

his script, for “authenticity,” I felt 

the writing of oppression should 

be left to those who experience 

that type of oppression.

Explaining 
this 
thought 

requires the question: Can white 

people make a race-based film? 

The answer is yes, but only if 

we’re not necessitating it to be 

a nuanced or sophisticated one. 

Consider the films “Detroit” by 

Kathryn Bigelow and “Django 

Unchained” 
by 
Quentin 

Tarantino — both are innovative 

and 
interesting 
works 
but 

neither really say something 

new of racial strife, only serving 

to remind the people that they 

are central players in historical 

oppression, in graphic form. For 

a racial group that, despite their 

intentions, can only ever be on 

the “winning” end of racism, 

writing about race and racists 

initiates the regeneration of one-

dimensionally racist characters 

— old white men with old white 

minds, unabashed Neo-Nazis 

and unafraid wizards of the Ku 

Klux Klan — a dangerous pattern 

that obscures the shape-shifting 

manifestations of racism in the 

current day.

For 
white 
people, 
racial 

oppression is an easy plot device 

that instantly makes a movie 

“deeper.” For Black people, racial 

oppression is an everyday reality 

that we don’t have to go see 

on screen. Unless it’s like “Get 

Out,” a movie written for Black 

people by Black people to show 

the intricacy of racism with an 

unmatched sensitivity, there’s 

nothing new that can be said in 

a movie about the twisted past 

and present of racism as long as 

it’s not working to write racists 

with nuance, who, if we’re 

being completely candid with 

ourselves, are most likely people 

a lot like Justin.

I’m not gonna lie, I love 

Bollywood’s masala movies as 

much as the next person. But it 

wasn’t until I watched a non-

commercial film that I realized 

how much my perception of the 

industry is shaped by those in 

power. I was just in India for a 

couple weeks and while I was there 

I watched a movie that I had never 

heard of before: AndhaDhun didn’t 

feature any stars that I would 

consider “big”, yet the entire cast 

is very experienced and critically-

acclaimed. The movie itself is one 

of the best I’ve seen come out of 

Bollywood in ages.

I watch Hindi movies to stay 

connected to my roots. But it 

wasn’t until I saw Andhadhun 

that I realized I have a singular 

idea of what Bollywood and “my 

roots” look like. I decide which 

Hindi films I want to watch based 

on who is in the movie, rather 

than what the movie is about. The 

big players in the industry - the 

Khans, the Kapoors, and anyone 

that Karan Johar casts in a film 

- influence which movies I deem 

worth seeing.

This may not be problematic 

in itself - naturally, you’re going 

to watch the movies that feature 

celebrities you like. However, it’s 

important to examine exactly why 

you like those particular actors 

over others. My favorite actors are 

the ones in the movies I grew up 

watching: Hrithik Roshan, Kajol, 

Kareena Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, 

Aamir Khan, Priyanka Chopra, 

and Preity Zinta … they’re the big 

stars of the 90s and early 2000s 

and the movies they starred in are 

the ones I watch when I’m sick, 

when I’m bored, and when I’m 

just feeling nostalgic. But, I didn’t 

decide who my favorite actors of 

the current generation are based 

on their acting ability - I love 

Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, 

Siddharth Malhotra, and Aditya 

Roy Kapoor because they were in 

commercial movies and they were 

interviewed on Koffee with Karan. 

They’re 
not 
terrible 
actors… 

in fact, I would argue Ranveer 

Singh is an excellent actor! Yet, 

Rajkumar Rao, Kangana Ranaut, 

Radhika Apte, and Ayushmann 

Khurrana (the main actor in 

AndhaDhun) most definitely have 

incredible acting skills. Yet, when I 

think of my favorites celebrities, or 

even Bollywood as a whole, their 

names don’t come to mind.

Because of this, I have most 

likely deprived myself of so many 

great films. I’m so focused on 

getting myself to the movie theater 

to see the commercial films with 

the big name actors that I never 

even realized that I’m missing out 

on some really great content. The 

fault isn’t entirely mine though - 

the bigger stars have more money, 

more industry connections, and 

more name recognition (thank 

you nepotism) so their movies 

get advertised here in the United 

States more than movies with not 

so famous actors. Yet, the movie 

theaters make their decisions 

based on what the audience wants. 

So, if I make a more dedicated 

effort to actually go to the theater 

and watch the movies that don’t 

feature a Kapoor or a Khan, 

then maybe the theaters will 

start promoting them more and 

they’ll be more popular. Watching 

AndhaDhun has made me decide 

to prioritize the quality of films 

over who is in them. And I hope 

Bollywood’s audience will also 

move in this direction as well. I see 

this happening a little bit already, 

as movies like AndhaDhun did 

better at the box office than 

Namaste England, which featured 

two stars born into prominent 

Bollywood families. It may not be 

an immediate shift, but I hope this 

means more high-quality films - 

featuring actors who worked their 

way into the industry instead of 

being born into it - are advertised 

more and actually premiered in 

theaters in the United States, so I 

can go watch them!

a lynching in
2018


C

ollege students love their 
themed parties — so when 
Halloweekend 
comes 
around, many pull out all the stops 
to dress in a multitude of dazzling 
costumes that will inevitably end 
up contributing to a never-ending 
stream of Halloween posts on 
Instagram. Some popular costumes 
I spotted this year were boxers, 
devils and, of course, all kinds 
of feline ceatures. While these 
costumes certainly were not very 
original, I thought they were fun, 
and the people wearing them 
looked great.
In contrast, a costume that I did 
not like was one I saw many people 
wearing – a prisoner costume. Not 
only is dressing up as a prisoner for 
Halloween in poor taste, it’s also 
incredibly offensive. An orange 
jumpsuit isn’t some quirky, sexy 
outfit that people should parade 
around in for fun, and wearing it 
while toting matching handcuffs 
discounts 
how 
terrifying 
and 
degrading it is for many who actually 
do get arrested and sentenced to 
prison. Prisoners are real people, 
many of whom have been unfairly 
sentenced by a deeply flawed justice 
system, and to wear the attire that 
represents their sentence for the 
sake of having a fun costume is 
offensive. Conversely, dressing up 
as prisoners and portraying them as 
pitiable people is also problematic, 
because that reduces all prisoners 
to helpless populations rather than 
individuals.
We can see how flawed the 
United States justice system is when 
we examine famous statistics and 
cases: The U.S. has about 5 percent of 
the world’s population but about 25 
percent of the world’s incarcerated 
population. Young white men like 
Brock Turner are imprisoned for 
only three months after sexually 
assaulting an unconscious woman, 
whereas young Black boys like 
Trayvon Martin are shot (the 
shooter 
George 
Zimmerman 
found not guilty of second-degree 
murder and manslaughter). Alice 
Marie Johnson, a Black 63-year-old 
woman, was only granted clemency 
from a life sentence for a non-
violent, first time drug offense after 

Kim Kardashian used her celebrity 
status to appeal to the president. 
This isn’t to say all police officers 
are racist and violent and everyone 
who is a part of the justice system is 
corrupt. Of course there are plenty 
of good people in the justice system 
— but the flaws that plague it are 
also plentiful and obvious.
So when people dress up as 
prisoners 
for 
Halloween 
and 
pretend to get arrested for the sake 
of some likes on Instagram, they 
are making a mockery of actual 

prisoners and how the justice 
system has failed so many people, 
even if they don’t mean to do so. It’s 
not “just a costume” because of the 
history of injustice that permeates 
even to a fake prisoner’s jumpsuit, 
and it doesn’t matter that the people 
wearing such a costume don’t mean 
to offend, because intent doesn’t 
change effect.
A reason why people may believe 
prisoner costumes are appropriate 
may be due to the romanticization 
of prison life in recent years. TV 
shows such as “Orange is the 
New Black” and documentaries 
such as “Making a Murderer” are 
incredibly popular, as are crime 
shows. Jeremy Meeks, otherwise 
known as “Hot Felon” or “Prison 
Bae,” went viral because of his good 
looks (and is somehow now dating 
the heiress of TopShop). People 
are intrigued by prison life and 
the justice system because of how 
mysterious and almost glamorous 
the whole process seems. Is the 
accused truly guilty? How can the 
lawyers convince others of their 
client’s innocence? People live out 
their Nancy Drew and Sherlock 
Holmes fantasies while they watch 

murder mystery types of shows 
and try to figure out the truth, and 
shows like “Orange is the New 
Black” offer them a glimpse into a 
life they have always been warned 
against 
living. 
Whether 
these 
shows mean to romanticize prison 
life and the processes that occur in 
the justice system, impressionable 
viewers are free to perceive them 
however they want to.
The 
popularity 
of 
prison-
related media complicates the 
question of whether dressing up 
as a prisoner is acceptable when 
we examine generic costumes 
versus specific costumes. While 
dressing up as a generic prisoner 
is offensive, is dressing up as 
Piper from “Orange is the New 
Black” just as insensitive? This 
is a bit of a gray area, because 
dressing up as a specific character 
means representing only that one 
character rather than an entire 
group of people, and those who 
choose to put in the effort to dress 
up as a specific character usually 
tend to have a general respect 
for that character that shows 
in their costume. In this case, 
the portrayal of the character 
matters more than the character 
itself: For example, dressing up 
as a hyper-sexualized version of 
Piper would be offensive, because 
doing so would essentially turn 
the costume into a caricature of 
the character and implies Piper’s 
life as a prisoner is glamorous. 
Once again, the person shouldn’t 
reenact any gory or sensitive 
scenes for any reason, such as for 
the sake of a “cool” photo.
In the end, it all boils down to 
using good judgement. Halloween 
should be enjoyable, and perhaps 
taking care to not wear offensive 
costumes takes away from that, but 
wearing offensive costumes has 
deeper, more hurtful implications. 
It’s not difficult to make sure a 
costume isn’t offensive, and the 
payoff is well worth the effort. So 
please, don’t dress up as a prisoner 
for Halloween.

T 

hose 
who 
share 
my 
concerns about the growing 
dominance of technology 
corporations know the major source 
of their influence comes from data. 
The usual suspects — Google, Amazon 
and Facebook — would not be able to 
reap such massive profits from their 
services without the vast quantities 
of data their users provide. The 
unfortunate reality is tech companies 
will not stop at the command of the 
digital world; they want control of 
where we live, too.
My latest fears stem from an 
urban renewal project in Toronto’s 
Quayside neighborhood managed 
by Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary 
of Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent 
company, that purports to engage in 
“urban innovation.” Just as the Google 
search engine has fine-tuned the way 
we research online, Sidewalk Labs 
now aims to transform a decrepit, 
flood-prone area in Toronto’s eastern 
waterfront into a “smart city” that 
will integrate data into the everyday 
lives of its residents. Some of the early 
proposals included self-driving cars, 
sensors that measure air quality and 
solutions pertaining to sustainable 
building and energy use. Sidewalk 
will also enlist the help of third-
party developers and consultants to 
help with various tangible aspects of 
the project. The initial illustrations 
completed 
by 
Michael 
Green 
Architecture are, I will admit, very 
appealing, though perhaps a little 
imaginative.
Beyond 
the 
high-rise 
timber 
buildings and floating movie theaters, 
however, lies a threat to the residents 
of Toronto: mass surveillance and 
retention of information. On the one 
hand, Sidewalk claims it is working 
closely with privacy experts and 
the local community to make sure 
people’s personal information is 
protected. One of the supposed 
guiding principles of the project 
is “Privacy by Design,” a concept 
developed in the 1990s by Ann 
Cavoukian, the information and 
privacy commissioner in Ontario, 
that 
prioritizes 
company-driven 
protection of personal information.
Sidewalk 
invited 
Cavoukian 
to work with the team last year as 
a consultant, but in October she 
resigned to “send a strong statement” 
about the prevalent data privacy issues 

in the project. The reason for her 
departure centers around access of 
third parties to stores of “identifiable” 
information collected as a part of 
Sidewalk’s services. Obviously it 
would be impossible to obtain 
everyone’s consent for, say, CCTV 
footage of pedestrians recorded 
in order to measure foot-traffic 
patterns, but in order to counteract 
this type of situation Sidewalk says 
it will use a slew of de-identification 
techniques. However, while Sidewalk 
has committed to de-identification 
practices, it admitted it could not force 
third parties to do the same. When 
Cavoukian heard this in a meeting, 
she packed up and left, saying, “I’m 
sorry. I can’t support this. I have to 
resign because you committed to 
embedding privacy by design into 
every aspect of your operation.”
It is a pretty bad sign for your data-
driven urban innovation venture 
when one of the foremost data 
privacy experts in North America 
makes such a vote of no-confidence. 
The former CEO of Blackberry Jim 
Balsillie put his opinion in less neutral 
language by calling the project “a 
colonizing experiment in surveillance 
capitalism.” Indeed, the privacy-
conscious minds in the tech industry 
all seem to be thinking along similar 
lines.
It all raises the question: Why would 
Alphabet want to do this? Why make 
an upwards of $50 million investment 
in this seemingly random Canadian 
neighborhood? The biggest reason is 
data: Its availability offers immense 
value to these types of companies. 
The data to be mined in Toronto 
represents trillions of dollars of 
intangible assets that easily outweigh 
any current or expected investment. 
Hardly any actual opposition stands 
in their way, and Sidewalk is taking 
all the ground they can get in terms 
of self-governing the entire project. 
During the public announcement, 
former Google Executive Chairman 
Eric Schmidt touted the long-standing 
goal for “someone to give us a city 
and put us in charge.” Unlike elected 
officials or government appointees, 
there would be very little oversight 
or 
accountability 
coming 
from 
regulators, let alone people living in 
Quayside.
One way Sidewalk is confusing 
their critics into submission is the 

hijacking of data typology. Data 
typology simply refers to the kind of 
data Sidewalk is trying to collect, and 
different types are subject to their own 
level of regulatory scrutiny. In a recent 
draft proposal, Sidewalk actually 
creates a new type called “Urban 
Data” for regulators to puzzle over. 
The ambiguity of this term is further 
complicated by the fact that it includes 
data ranging from CCTV camera 
footage to thermostat usage. Though 
“data laundering,” whereby criminals 
disguise the proceeds from illegal 
activities by “mixing” it with money 
from cleaner sources, is already used 
in cybersecurity to describe the sale 
of illegally mined data, the analogy 
works well for the massive amounts 
of data to be collected in Toronto, 
too. Sidewalk is placing more benign 
data types alongside more valuable, 
sensitive personal information and 
placing them all under the umbrella 
of Urban Data with its own unique set 
of rules. As long as Sidewalk has the 
ability to set its own guidelines, it will 
employ a healthy amount of obscurity 
as a tool against regulation.
Another major issue with the 
Toronto 
project 
is 
the 
role 
of 
intellectual 
property. Though residents may 
benefit from the amenities and quality 
of life on offer, businesses that work 
with Sidewalk may lose the ability 
to license their IP externally. In July, 
a “plan development agreement” 
between Waterfront Toronto and 
Sidewalk outlined how Waterfront 
Toronto could benefit from a stake 
in the project’s IP. Conversely, a 
design-procurement 
document 
obtained by a Canadian news outlet 
in August showed Sidewalk asking 
potential consultants to cede their 
IP rights, or at least to give them 
exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide 
license to the rights. Sidewalk’s 
manipulation of other entities 
— whether they be government 
agencies, private companies or 
the citizens of Toronto — shows 
their unrestrained influence in the 
project.
Whatever the outcome of the 
Sidewalk 
Toronto 
project, 
its 
legal framework will serve as the 
benchmark for future data-driven 
urban innovation projects. Let it be a

L

ast week’s mass shooting 
in 
Southern 
California 
reminds us that we rarely go 
more than a few months without a 
gun tragedy in America. Though 
purely criminal gun violence is 
far too commonplace to receive 
extensive 
coverage, 
schools, 
places of worship, concerts and 
pretty much anywhere else that 
should be devoid of bloodshed are 
periodically assaulted by firearm-
wielding 
domestic 
terrorists 
or 
psychologically 
unhinged 
chauvinists. In response to this 
crisis, we often hear reignited 
calls for incrementally stricter gun 
regulations.
But, this time, we should instead 
start with a thorough reevaluation 
of the Second Amendment. As 
its mere existence contributes 
greatly to the current epidemic 
of gun violence, and as it fails to 
contribute to the greater security of 
the American public, it is time to do 
away with it completely.
Against the backdrop of today’s 
gun problem, it’s hard to remember 
50 
years 
ago 
America’s 
gun 
violence reached a fever pitch. In a 
killing spree that spanned less than 
five years, assassins had brought 
to the grave the president of the 
United States, John F. Kennedy; his 
brother and presidential hopeful 
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy; and civil 
rights hero Martin Luther King 
Jr. What kind of nation, ailed by 
slaughter of this degree, could 
honestly pride itself in effective 
governance?
In response, President Lyndon 
B. Johnson attempted to tighten 
restrictions on firearm purchases, 
issuing a call for a national gun 
registry and a license requirement 
for all would-be gun owners.
These suggestions marked the 
first major gun control legislation 
opposed by the National Rifle 
Association, whose evolution from 
genteel promoter of marksmanship 
to ideological lobbying machine 
was sparked, in part, by the 
domestic turbulence of the 1960s 
and the credibility this lent to 
more 
aggressive 
gun 
control 
efforts. Though these provisions 
were successfully stripped from 
what would later become the Gun 
Control Act of 1968, the act was 
nevertheless deemed by former 
NRA President David Keene as 
the “most restrictive piece of 
Second 
Amendment 
legislation 
ever 
passed,” 
foreshadowing 
the emergence of a full-throated 
and well-endowed gun rights 
movement.
But for how vehemently the 
amendment 
is 
attacked 
and 
defended 
in 
current 
political 
discourse, its purpose remains 
widely misunderstood. Politicians’ 
campaign 
ads 
and 
lukewarm 
commentary 
would 
have 
you 
believe the Second Amendment 
exists to serve the needs of 
camouflaged sportsmen and over-
prepared homeowners, when in 
reality it was written solely to 

protect the concept of the militia. 
Up until modern times, this 
traditional reading of the Second 
Amendment was reflected in a 
deep American distrust of the 
standing army, a necessary evil 
the Constitution entrusted to the 
federal government instead of the 
states or people.
By 
preserving 
well-armed 
militias, 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
Constitution hoped to preempt 
the tyrannical impulses of an 
overarching federal government 
and any outsize standing army 
it 
may 
raise. 
Until 
recently, 
however, this insurance policy 
was not interpreted to protect the 
individual’s right to bear arms. As 
Richard Primus, a professor at the 
University of Michigan Law School, 
puts it, “The idea that the (Second) 
Amendment is about an individual 
right to own firearms, rather 
than the allocation of defense 
responsibilities between the states 
and 
the 
federal 
government, 
is a modern re-reading of the 
amendment.”
Perhaps there was once a time 
where the provision of militias 
protected the American public 
from tyranny. The emergence of 
a full-time, professional military 
fighting force over the course 
of 
this 
country’s 
existence, 
however, discounts the continued 
justification for any traditional 
reading of the Second Amendment.
For sake of argument, however, 
let’s assume the NRA is right to 
instead characterize the Second 
Amendment as an “individual 
freedom.” The revulsion with 
which gun rights activists treat 
one of the most prominent gun 
control 
proposals, 
the 
assault 
weapon ban, henceforth becomes 
all too understandable. In this 
reading, the individual’s right to 
revolt enshrined in the Second 
Amendment does not only protect 
the duck hunter’s double-barrel 
shotgun or the concerned father’s 
handgun, but it must also protect 
the mass shooter’s AR-15 assault 
rifle (with all of its military 
features) and the like. For just as the 
vastly powerful AR-15 parallels the 
battlefield service rifles wielded by 
the troops of our very own, outsize 
federal army today, the archaic 
muskets protected in the early 
years of the Second Amendment 
guarded their owners from the 
federal armories of comparable 
firepower.
To those concerned, mere rifles 
could not sufficiently serve as tools 
of revolt against a modern U.S. 
military comprising tanks, drones 
and 
nuclear 
bombs. 
Consider 
that 
overwhelming 
control 
and subjugation hinges not on 
annihilation, but on occupation of 
the populace. Insurgents fielding 
little more than assault rifles 
against our own military have 
indeed driven this point home over 
the past 50 years.
Even so, the underlying rationale 
of a right to revolt is flawed. If the 

Second Amendment were the 
only provision preventing our 
functioning 
democracy 
from 
plunging into a state of tyrannical 
frenzy, 
wouldn’t 
the 
healthy 
democracies of Europe, with their 
acute lack of similar liberties, have 
descended into authoritarian rule 
by now? It is not unreasonable to 
conclude 
American 
democracy 
has instead been preserved by 
institutions such as separation of 
powers, checks and balances, free 
and fair elections and civilian rule—
institutions that, unlike a right to 
bear arms, define democratic rule.
Additionally, there are costs 
associated 
with 
the 
Second 
Amendment, and an informed 
public has the right to consider 
them. 
No 
right 
exists 
in 
a 
vacuum, and those enshrined in 
constitutional amendments are no 
different. Indeed, as a plethora of 
research has shown, any benefit 
derived from a right to unfettered 
civilian armament fails to outweigh 
the costly damage this armament 
inflicts on American society. From 
our country’s insatiable saturation 
with 
guns, 
to 
the 
uniquely 
American ease with which these 
devices find their way into the 
hands of dangerous, untrained and 
suicidal individuals, it is no wonder 
we live in a steady state of firearm-
fueled chaos. Children in a first-
world country should not have to 
train for gunmen to interrupt their 
elementary school math class.
This violent American reality, 
unparalleled in other developed 
nations, 
necessitates 
sensible 
restrictions 
to 
be 
placed 
on 
which Americans, under what 
circumstances, can obtain lethal 
weapons. While repealing the 
Second 
Amendment 
would 
not preclude state and local 
governments from upholding the 
legality of guns for home defense 
and hunting, it would invalidate 
the NRA’s stated raison d’être 
and thereby allow these sensible 
restrictions to be seriously debated, 
considered and passed by our 
legislative bodies.
The 
prominent 
political 
assassinations of 1968 parallel 
our own gun crisis today, as the 
relatively limited scope of those 
tragedies did nothing to limit the 
horror and subsequent outrage 
they 
delivered. 
The 
powerful 
influences that stymied effective 
change then are also at work now, 
and ensure the continued survival 
of a gun crisis in America. As was 
the case in 1968, the role of the 
government is to restore public 
safety in the most effective way 
possible without putting individual 
liberties at risk. Doing away with 
the Second Amendment is the 
ideal and obvious solution to this 
dilemma. What is there left to 
consider?

I was recently asked who I 
consider to be my favorite writer. 
It’s always a difficult question 
for me to answer — everyone I 
look up to for their writing, I 
look up to for a different reason, 
and there are quite a lot of those 
people. A Bob Dylan quote about 
his influences always jumps into 
my mind: “Open your eyes and 
your ears and you’re influenced.” 
There is something to learn from 
everyone.
But today I’m going to talk 
about an answer I pretty much 
never 
give 
in 
conversation: 
Taylor Swift.
I know what you might be 
thinking — “Ugh, not this again.” 
I stumble into a conversation 
about Taylor Swift, or onto a 
news headline about her, on at 
least a weekly basis. We’re all 
obsessed with her, in a national 
sense, whether we love her 
or love to hate her. Even I, a 
fan of Swift’s, can admit that 
it can get a little 
tiresome. 
Today 
my goal is just to 
tackle Swift from a 
literary perspective, 
because 
to 
me 
she 
is 
the 
best 
representation 
of 
something that I’ve 
seen 
from 
other 
artists as well.
When I said I 
never give Taylor 
Swift as an answer, 
it 
was 
for 
two 
reasons. The first 
I’ve already hinted 
at: It’s Taylor Swift. 
There are a lot of 
things about her I 
don’t like. I think 
that 
people 
are 
right 
to 
criticize 
her 
tendency 
to 
slip 
in 
and 
out 
of 
convenient 
identities 
(“the 
victim” being a big 
one), and a few too 
many of her songs 
for my liking milk 
the concept of being 
“not like other girls.” 
I wanted to know 
that she supported 
Democrats 
much 
earlier than 2018 
(although I’m very 
glad 
to 
have 
it 
confirmed 
now). 
Only 
last 
month, 
Akanksha 
Sahay 
wrote a great piece 
interrogating 
the 
complicated, 
at 
times 
problematic 
nature 
of 
Swift’s 
relationships 
with 
feminism 
and 
privilege and her 
recent 
political 
evolution.
The 
second 
reason 
is 
more 
what I’d like to go 
into 
here: 
When 
people ask which 
writers I admire, 
they usually mean 
a specific type of 
writing. I generally 
take 
it 
to 
mean 
novels 
and 
short 
stories, 
because 
fiction is what I 
write 
personally, 

but I’m sure people would also 
be receptive if I named a poet, 
an essayist or a playwright. 
A songwriter is a little less 

expected, which in a way makes 
sense — you don’t sit down and 
read songs.
I got into Taylor Swift in 
middle school, not long before 
I started attending an arts 
school where the literary part 
of myself would be set on fire by 
writers like Joyce Carol Oates 
and Flannery O’Connor (both 
of whom, I’ve found out since, 
have their own huge sets of 
problems, but that’s for another 
time). In those days, I wrote 
constantly: on the bus, in class, 
after school. All of my class notes 

from middle school generally 
follow a pattern — half a page 
or so of real note-taking, then 
two or three pages of exciting 
fiction during which you can bet 
I wasn’t paying attention at all. 
The front pocket of my backpack 
was always crammed with the 
loose pages of some story, strung 
together across whatever was 
around: printer paper, loose leaf, 
napkins, pamphlets.
While occasionally I’d muster 
up a crush on someone just to 
have something to talk about, I 
was not particularly interested 
in romance at the time. So when 
I danced around my room to 
the songs from Taylor Swift 
and Fearless, shouting along to 
the lyrics about some boy I was 
falling in love with, no particular 
person had taken shape in my 
mind. I loved Swift’s images — 
“the moon like a spotlight on 
the lake,” “Friday night beneath 
the stars / In a field behind your 
yard” — but didn’t live in them 
myself, and didn’t really want to 
yet.
I loved Taylor Swift more 

than 
anything 
because 
she 
made writing fun. The pieces 
from that initial phase that I 
remember most clearly all have 
to do with that passion: an image 
from her first album’s liner notes 
of Swift poring over a notebook, 
deep in concentration, a video 
of her exclaiming about how 
she’s getting a really good idea. 
Another video of her high school 
classmates being interviewed, 
talking about how Swift was 
constantly writing — they’d even 
seen her write on paper towels 
and napkins when she didn’t 
have paper.
There were always writers I 
loved, but Taylor Swift struck 
something new for me. In middle 
school, like everyone, I felt 
awkward, cumbersome, insecure 
and off-and-on lonely. It thrilled 
me to learn about somebody who 
was so passionate about writing 
that, when she was my same age, 
she’d decided to make a career 
out of it — and she’d done it 
successfully. Swift was working 
regularly as a songwriter long 
before she put out her first 
album, and a few albums later, 
she was still excited to be doing 
it. Her first album’s first song, 
“Tim McGraw,” mentions “a 
letter that you never read,” and 
one of her very first hits, “Our 
Song,” ends on the image of 
writing: “I grabbed a pen and an 
old napkin / And I wrote down 
our song.” And while it’s true 
that she sometimes wielded this 
self-reference in ways I didn’t 
like (“All those other girls, well 
they’re beautiful / But would 
they write a song for you?”), I 
was still drawn to this attention 
to writing because it made me 
feel encouraged in my own life.
As a kid who had often stayed 
in from recess during elementary 
just to write short stories by 
myself, I was enamored. I’m 
still enamored. Swift didn’t 
just have passion; she had the 
direction and determination to 
see that passion through, and 
she still does. She writes in her 
music videos, and in YouTube 
videos about her songwriting 
process. One Google search of 
“Taylor Swift writing” yields a 
ton of images of her scrawling in 
notebooks, mulling over a guitar.
I think one of the reasons 
we love Swift (those of us who 
do) is always going to be her 
image. When Taylor Swift falls 
in love, it’s in a beautiful dress, 
in the rain. When Taylor Swift 
writes, she looks good doing 
it, and then later that writing 
comes out on an award-winning 
album. Through all of her 
storytelling — her love stories, 
her angry tirades, her diary-
esque reminiscing on childhood 
memories 
and 
family 
and 
friends — she paints a picture 
of a world, a dream, in which 
her own emotions and thoughts 
and ideas become manifest. 
This is the very core of the act of 
writing, and it’s what makes it so 
easy to fall in love with Swift’s 
work. She can take the emotions 
that make her vulnerable and, 
using talent and hard work and 
her craft, turn that vulnerability 
into 
something 
admirable 
and untouchable. To me that 
has always been the ultimate 
superpower.

Taylor Swift and the 
image of writing

DAILY LITERATURE COLUMN

LAURA 
DZUBAY

‘Outlaw King’ is slow-moving, not worth the time

“Outlaw King” is a historical 
war drama about Robert Bruce 
(Chris Pine, “Wonder Woman”), 
a fearless pariah who leads a 

rebellion with his countrymen 
to reclaim his homeland from 
the formidable English army 
in the 14th century. While the 
movie boasts a strong attention 
to period detail and notable 
battle sequences, “Outlaw King” 
collapses onto a weak narrative 
skeleton 
and 
proves 
mostly 
unwatchable in its later acts. 
Some 
of 
the 
film’s 
few 
highlights are its costumes and 
set design. The first quarter, 
which largely takes place during 
indoor feasts, never fails to 
appear genuinely synchronistic. 
The appropriately plain kilts, 
candlelit interiors of war tents 
and gleaming armor of soldiers 
breathed life into an otherwise 
bland visual palette and dismal 
conversation scenes.
The inarguable high point 
of “Outlaw King,” however, is 
its first shot. The nine-minute 

take initially reveals the politics 
of the war in the confines of a 
dark tent, then travels to the 
brighter war camp outside. From 
there, the shot showcases a 
brilliantly choreographed sword 
duel that likely took weeks to 
rehearse, as well as an impressive 
catapult launch that ends in 
a fiery explosion. At first, this 
opening sequence truly seems 
to herald strong camerawork 
and action scenes from director 
David Mackenzie (“Hell or High 
Water”).
And yet, for all the effort that 
Mackenzie puts into his later 
battle sequences, they fall short 
of being original. One sequence 
involving a riverbank by a dense 
forest was so reminiscent of Peter 
Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” 
that it felt tacky. Another set 
piece involving a fiery nighttime 
assault on Bruce’s camp brilliantly 
combined practical and digital 
effects to immerse a viewer in the 
heat of the battle, but gradually 
descended into incoherence as 
Mackenzie’s camerawork lost its 
focus.
Aside from the film’s action 
and costumes, it is a thoughtlessly 
constructed mess in terms of 
narrative, editing and pacing. 
Almost every character feels 
underdeveloped 
and 
poorly 
written, to the point that entire 

passages of dialogue play out 
nonsensically. While there are a 
few standout performances from 
Pine and Stephen Dillane (“Game 
of Thrones”), even their lines 

feel wooden and hollow. Pine 
specifically does an admirable 
job as a scruffy rebel king, and his 
Scottish accent is spot-on. Though 
the strength of his performance 
cannot overcome a painfully weak 
script, there are several moments 
in the film in which viewers are 
left wondering why characters

FILM REVIEW

make the decisions they do, 
forced to supplant their memory 
with only guesses as to the logic 
of events. Whether involving a 
rushed romantic subplot between 
Bruce 
and 
Queen 
Margaret 
(newcomer Rebecca Robin) or 
a deceitful murder toward the 
film’s start, Mackenzie does not 
seem to care whether viewers 
even receive such explanations.
Another 
reason 
that 
the 
narrative of “Outlaw King” may 
confound the audience is through 
its editing. While the film lasts just 
over two hours, the original cut 
was clearly much longer. There 
are obvious gaps in the story, 

entire missing scenes that later 
contribute to a payoff that simply 
doesn’t land. In particular, when 
a fighter dies on the battlefield, 
the frames decelerate to slow-
motion. The heroes cry the name 
of their fallen companion, but the 
audience often has no idea who 
just died. The emotional impact of 
these moments is nearly negligible 
because the source of attachment 
to these soldiers — a backstory 
— ended up on the cutting room 
floor. 
Although, 
inserting 
these 
scenes back into the film would 
not be a neat solution either. In 
the third and penultimate act, 

“Outlaw King” takes a turn, to 
put it mildly, toward being boring. 
The film is paced in a way that 
bookends the narrative tension, 
and towards the middle, viewers 
may not so much wonder what 
happens next as they will why 
they are still watching. A subplot 
involving Bruce’s wife and a dull 
recruiting phase for the rebellion 
cut between each other for what 
seems like an eternity. 
For diehard war movie fans, 
this film might just offer a solid 
half hour of enjoyment. For 
everyone else, myself included, 
“Outlaw King” is below passable 
and not worth seeing.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

Muse might be a British band, 
but they reached the height of 
their popularity in the States 
when George Bush’s presidency 
turned 
toward 
absolute 
contention. Without feeling too 
abstract or derivative, Absolution 
and Black Holes and Revelations 

played like soundtracks to “1984”; 
they spoke to our emotions, 
not just our politics. You might 
have even hated Muse, felt their 
political slant was a bit too “holier 
than thou,” but there was no 
denying their talent, the magnetic 
bass of Christ Wolstenholme and 
Matt Bellamy’s impressive vocal 
range.
This is why 2015’s Drones was 
a disappointment: On a surface 
level, it was a classic Muse album, 
concept based and musically 
exceptional. 
But 
the 
lyrics 
and concept itself were trite, 
difficult to follow and downright 
patronizing. Drones is comparable 
to your uncle frothing conspiracy 
theories during Thanksgiving 
dinner; it lacked tact and tried too 
hard to push a message about war 
and drones. In essence, it forgot 
how to have fun.
Muse’s 
latest 
release 
Simulation 
Theory 
settles 
somewhere 
in 
the 
middle. 
Although by no means their best 
release, it handles its concept 
well and brings Muse’s lyricism 
back to earth. Inspired by the 
“simulation hypothesis,” it talks 
about sci-fi like a dystopian novel 
would: thematically cautious and 
immersive, elegantly riding off 
the ’80s synth and pop culture 
trend without sacrificing Muse’s 
sound.
The initial track “Algorithm” 
begins with a pounding synth 
that transforms and builds; it 
gets grittier and rougher until 

it culminates in a softer, almost 
symphonic pulsation with the 
introduction of a piano and 
violin. Bellamy’s iconic falsetto 
carries the rising and falling of 
the beat following the minute-
and-a-half mark. It plays like a 
fresher intro theme to “Tron,” 
with its ominous but melodic beat 
that oscillates between chugging 
and fluttering forward. Although 
the lyrics (“Churn like a cog / 
We are caged in simulations / 
Algorithms evolve”) are far from 
a little hard to take seriously, 
it still plays well into this sort 
of “Brave New World” Muse 
attempts to illustrate throughout 
Simulation Theory.
Conversely, the third track off 
the album, “Pressure,” veers less 
into abstracts. The imagery is a lot 
easier to grasp as Bellamy croons 
“I’m feeling the pressure / I can’t 
break out / No one can hear me 
scream and shout.” The phrase 
“pressure building” is whispered 
sporadically 
throughout 
the 
song, further pushing the image 
of someone breaking down with 
building tension. Classic Muse 
guitar riffs streak the song and 
pull it forward as a subdued synth 
slinks in the background. Heavy-
handed and perhaps a slightly 
more esoteric presentation of 
our current political state, the 
song doesn’t make it too obvious, 
playing off more anthemic and 
catchy.
“Propaganda” 
serves 
as 
the album’s most overtly ’80s 
sounding 
song. 
Its 
opening 
rumbles with scratchy robotic 
vocals that repeat the word 
“propaganda” 
erratically, 
an 
obvious reference to Prince’s 
1999. There are vague whispers 
of “Kiss”’s guitar licks and beats 
that marry well with Bellamy’s 
notably 
high-pitched 
vocals. 
But where Prince succeeds in 
telling his listeners “Fuck it, let’s 
party” at the sight of the end of 
the world, Muse fails as they 
persuade us to save it, folding in 
vague references to oil slicks and 
lying politicians.
The rest of the album follows 
the same formula of synth, a 
vague ’80s reference and political 
commentary. This isn’t to say the 
elements do not bond well with 

each other; every ingredient 
works in tandem to deliver 
Muse’s unwavering commentary 
and caution. Musically, the album 
is refreshing, deftly stitching in 

influences that generally exist 
strictly in genres. Despite the 
heavy incorporation of synth, 
the instrumentation is lavish and 
full, with bass and drums making 
useful appearances as well. As 
a concept album, “Simulation 
Theory” is polished, cohesive and 
steered clear of monotony.
The problem with “Simulation 
Theory” comes in the sense that it 
is too polished, too clean and too 
obsessed with the bigger picture. 
It paints a political picture 
broadly and in binaries of good 
and evil rather than exploring the 
more human component to our 
current political climate. Muse 
does not bring any new ideas to 
the table despite their extensive 
efforts to present themselves as 
profound. Politics is a lot fuzzier 
and expansive than brainwashing 
and good versus evil. A political 
concept 
album 
only 
really 
succeeds when it can be made 
personal and tell a story — not 
merely scream out abstractions 
and emotive lyricism.

‘Simulation Theory’ is an 
unconvincing dystopia

Rude Mechanicals wows 
in ‘Let the Right One In’

Blind dates are always an 
interesting experience. Like most 
things, they can go one of two 
ways: well, or not so well. You run 
the risk of commiting to a long 
interaction with a person you do 
not get along with at all, or you 
get the awesome experience of 
meeting a person that you mesh 
really well with that you never 
would have known otherwise. 
Last Sunday, I had a blind date 
with the Rude Mechanicals’s 
production of “Let the Right One 
In.”
It started off pretty well; The 
show started on time and the 
set was beautiful. However, the 
conversation I was about to have 
was dramatically different than I 
was expecting. I was expecting 
a performance about letting 
the right people into your life, 
or something along those lines. 
However, when the production 
opened with a gruesome murder, 
I was surprised, to say the least.
One might expect someone 
writing a review of this play to 
have done a little more research 
before actually seeing said play. 
While most of the time I agree, 
the initial, raw reactions are also 
interesting and noteworthy. 
The story follows a young 
boy, Oskar, and his recently 
established 
friendship 
with 
the new girl in town, Eli. Amid 
merciless bullying and a less 
than great life at home, Oskar’s 
relationship with his new friend 
blossoms. However, Oskar starts 
to realize a connection between 
the sudden murders in the town 
with the appearance of Eli.
After such an intense opening 
scene, I was hooked. Director 
James Harbaugh seemed to do 

everything in his power to grab 
the audience and keep them 
intrigued from the get-go in this 
almost three-hour performance. 
The opening details seemed 
perfect; 
the 
beautiful 
set, 
complete with seemingly realistic 
snow and trees, created an eerie 
environment that portrayed the 
dark woods of a Norwegian town 
quite well. Seeing the snow fly up 
in gusts as characters ran from 
stage left to stage right reminded 
me of winter here in Mich.
The production used a fitting 
soundtrack of industrial-based 
synth music, adding tension to 
climaxes and atmosphere to 
other scenes. However, there 
were times when it felt like the 
production seemed to rely a 
bit too much on the music for 
each of those things. One of the 
biggest action sequences towards 
the end felt slightly reliant on 
the sudden burst of sound to 
startle the audience, when the 
screams and movement on stage 
were just as alarming. These 
effects definitely added to the 
experience, but they crept a bit 
too much into the fore every once 
in a while.
Relationships 
between 
characters 
proved 
to 
be 
a 
central 
element 
throughout 
the play, whether it be Oskar’s 
relationship with Eli, his bully 
or his separated parents. The 
production 
does 
this 
quite 
well 
through 
juxtaposition. 
Slight changes in SMTD Junior 
Bryan 
Chan’s 
portrayal 
of 
Oskar highlighted the other 
characters’ 
current 
struggles 
with relationships. Even Oskar’s 
lonesome 
walks 
across 
the 
stage through the fake snow 
displayed elements of character 
development. 
SMTD 
Sophomore 
Emma 
Steiner’s 
portrayal 
of 
Eli, 

however, 
was 
absolutely 
haunting. 
Every 
action 
she 
performed gave more and more 
depth to her character. From 
every breath she took to every 
scream she belted, it felt as if it 
was coming from a 200 year-old 
vampire. And not the vampires 
that 
“Twilight” 
glamorized: 
Her portrayal was monstrous, 
sickening and terrifying at times, 
yet I felt sympathy for her. I 
wasn’t disgusted, and I wasn’t 
sure why. That level of depth 
from the character, even after 
killing and dining on blood, had 
me concerned for the characters’ 
safety and well-being at times.
The production was dark, 
both physically and conceptually. 
However, while there were small, 
more subtle instances of comic 
relief inserted (and I mean, very 
subtle), the audience seemed to 
crack up at these small moments, 
almost ruining the mood and 
continuity of the performance 
for me. This isn’t necessarily a 
critique of the performance itself, 
just an observation on going to a 
live event. You’re in the space 
with other people, and that adds 
to the aspect of live performance, 
whether you like it to or not. The 
date itself was great, it’s just 
that the atmosphere was a bit 
distracting.
I regret not seeing more 
student theater productions here 
on campus. As someone who has 
only briefly participated on stage, 
I really respect the work these 
students put into their craft, 
and after working on multiple 
projects with actors both in 
and outside of the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance, I know 
how talented they are. After a 
successful first date, to say that 
I’m excited for more dates with 
the Rude Mechanicals would be 
an understatement.

Another Roadtrip

The Daily took another 
long, arduous roadtrip 
this weekend — this 
time to Piscataway. 
There are good reasons.

Another Daily road trip
T

he Daily’s sports sec-
tion 
takes 
road trips.
It’s oddly 
part of our 
identity.
And 
they’re not 
normal road 
trips, where 
you stop 
at a hotel 
and take it 
easy. We’re talking through-
the-night-for-10-hours-back-
from-New-York road trips. The 
type of road trips where you 
get done writing after a game 
and immediately get in a car, 
because there’s class or a paper 
to make the next day.
We wouldn’t do it if we 
didn’t have to, but the budget is 
tight, and we apparently don’t 
have any alumni at Boeing who 
want to donate a plane.
So we drive. And when we 
get to games, the adult sports 
writers shake their heads and 
laugh at our efforts.
That’s especially the case for 
a trip like last weekend’s, when 
the football beat drove to Pis-
cataway to cover No. 4 Michi-
gan’s game against Rutgers.
About 20 hours on the road 
for a game that was all-but-
predetermined.
But The Daily’s sports sec-
tion prides itself on covering 
things in person. So, Mark Cal-
cagno, Max Marcovitch, Ethan 
Wolfe and I — along with the 
two photographers: Alec Cohen 
and Ruchita Iyer — crammed 
in a rental Dodge Caravan and 
took off around 10 a.m. Friday 
morning. An experienced crew, 
the trip to Rye, N.Y., — where 
we were staying the night with 
another Daily writer’s parents 
— went off without a hitch.
We stopped once for gas at 
a small station in rural Penn-
sylvania, where the attendant 
pumped our gas for us and 
told us to “just use the ladies’ 

room,” while we were waiting 
in line for the restroom. The 
local newspaper, The Prog-
ress, had stories 
about selfie sta-
tions and leaf 
pickup opera-
tions on the 
front page.
That was 
pretty much it 
until Rye, but 
the daytime 
drives aren’t the 
interesting ones 
anyway.
We had a 
hot dinner and a good night’s 
sleep, woke up, watched the 
Wolverines beat up the Scarlet 
Knights for a few hours, then 

wrote our stories and got back 
on the road, just over 24 hours 
after we had gotten off it.
Mark started 
and took the 
first tank of gas, 
filling back up 
at another rural 
Pennsylvania 
station around 
3:30 a.m. Sun-
day. From there, 
I took over.
By this point, 
I’ve developed 
a reputation 
for driving the 
graveyard shift on road trips. 
The next morning I regret 
it very much, but during the 
drive and with the help of too 

much caffeine, I honestly don’t 
mind it. There’s something 
peaceful about it, and if any-
body’s going to 
fall asleep and 
crash into a 
ditch, it might 
as well be the 
Managing 
Sports Editor.
More than the 
actual driving, 
though, I think 
the affinity for 
these road trips 
stem from what 
you learn about 
the people in the car with you, 
and the memories that result 
from that.
If we didn’t take these road 

trips, I wouldn’t have memo-
ries of Mark’s lead foot, Max’s 
inability to steer smoothly 
through a turn 
or Ethan’s crip-
pling carsick-
ness. More 
formatively, I 
wouldn’t have 
the countless 
inside jokes to 
fondly look back 
fondly on.
It seems 
weird that these 
things come 
to mind for 
me before the events that we 
actually covered. I’ve covered 
Jordan Poole’s buzzer beater 
and a Final Four and football 

games at Notre Dame Stadium, 
Spartan Stadium and now, 
Highpoint.com Stadium.
Come to think of it, it’s 
weird trying to describe any 
of these personal memories 
shared between a few people. 
Perhaps this column was much 
better in theory than it was 
in practice, but in the dead of 
night, with nobody else on the 
road and me clinging to my 
sanity and the steering wheel 
at the same time, I pondered 
why we do these drives in the 
first place.
Then I looked in the rear-
view mirror, at Mark leaning 
on top of Max, both trying 
to get a few hours of sleep. I 
looked at Ethan, valiantly stay-
ing awake with me and singing 
along to the words. I saw Alec 
and Ruchita in the backseat, 
falling in and out of sleep 
but along for the ride. I hope 
they’ll remember these dumb 
trips affectionately like I do.
Anyways, it’s better than 
any exaggerated conclusions 
I could have tried to draw 
from the football game, which 
ultimately went as planned 
and told us nothing we didn’t 
already know.
We got back to Ann Arbor 
after the sun had already risen. 
I dropped off Mark then Max 
then Ethan. As I pulled up to 
Alec and Ruchita’s apartment 
building, Ethan texted me that 
he forgot his aux cord in the 
car. It’s a good thing he did, 
because I didn’t know how to 
end this column at that time.
But after Alec and Ruchita 
got out of the car and I was by 
myself again, “Comfortably 
Numb” by Pink Floyd came on 
shuffle.
I can’t explain, you would 
not understand, sings Roger 
Waters.

ALEC COHEN/Daily
The Michigan Daily’s football beat drove 10 hours to Piscataway for Michigan’s game against Rutgers on Saturday, their longest road trip of the season.

Michigan beats Rutgers, 42-7

PISCATAWAY — For a 
fleeting moment, HighPoint.
com stadium broke out into 
riotous cheers.
With 39 seconds left in 
the first quarter, Rutgers 
running back Isaih Pacheco 
found a gaping hole through 
the teeth of the No. 4 
Michigan 
football 
team’s 
No.1-ranked defense — an 
accomplishment of its own. 
Then he kept running, past 
a 
flat-footed 
secondary 
and into the endzone for 
an 80-yard touchdown and 
the longest rush since the 
Scarlet Knights joined the 
Big Ten in 2014.
“The immediate response 
is we’ve been through a lot 
worse,” said junior defensive 
end 
Rashan 
Gary. 
“One 
touchdown is not gonna hurt 
us. We’ve got to get back to 
playing football.
“And that’s what we did.”
The 
moment 
— 
an 
explosion 
of 
excitement 
from 
fans 
who 
rarely 
experience it — faded. It 
was 
never 
Rutgers’ 
(0-7 
Big Ten, 1-9 overall) night, 
nor 
was 
it 
supposed 
to 
be. The Wolverines (7-0, 
9-1) eventually settled in 
and cruised to a 42-7 win, 
spearheaded 
by 
junior 
quarterback Shea Patterson, 
who 
finished 
18-for-27 
for 260 yards and three 
touchdowns.
“That was a really tough 
night to throw the ball.” said 
coach Jim Harbaugh about 
the playing conditions. “… 
He made some throws that 
were just unbelievable. Put 
it in the right spot, with the 
wind blowing and swirling.”
Before Pacheco’s score, 
senior running back Karan 
Higdon found paydirt first 
on a drive featuring five 
different ball carriers to give 
Michigan the early lead.
On the drive following 
the 
80-yard 
touchdown, 
Higdon scored again from 
one yard out. Both of the 
Wolverines’ 
touchdowns 

could 
have 
materialized 
into longer scores, but wind 
and dropped passes kept its 
longest play to 16 yards.
That 
was 
until 
the 
5:07 mark in the second 
quarter. 
Secondary 
miscommunication allowed 
sophomore 
wide 
receiver 
Nico 
Collins 
to 
streak 
unchecked 
and 
open 
for 
an easy 36-yard toss from 
Patterson to bring a 21-7 lead 
into halftime.
“It was like, the (defensive 
back) passed me off and it 
was one-on-one with the 
safeties in the middle of the 
field, so I thought ‘I’ve got 
a chance to make this play,’ 
” Collins said. “And once he 
passed me off I’m like, ‘It’s 
just me back here, the safety 
is nowhere near here,’ and I 
got the ball.”
Rutgers, meanwhile, met 
expectations of mediocrity 
in the first 30 minutes: no 
sacks 
or 
tackles-for-loss, 
cornerback 
confusion, 
a 
shanked punt, zero first-
half passing yards despite 
two 
completions 
and 
so 
on. 
But 
the 
infrequent 
chunk yardage plays and 
sluggishness from Michigan 
were 
enough 
to 
warrant 
praise from Collins.
“They came out and they 
were ready to play,” Collins 
said. “They had nothing to 
lose so they came out there 
with a little chip on their 
shoulder and try to beat us. 
… They came out with their 
A-game.”
Then 
the 
second 
half 
happened. Both teams and 
fanbases probably wish it 
hadn’t.
Already 
without 
safety Josh Metellus and 
cornerback Lavert Hill to 
respective soft tissue and 
head injuries according to 
Harbaugh, 
the 
Michigan 
defense saw linemen Kwity 
Paye and Josh Uche leave the 
field in pain.
And in terms of on-field 
excitement, it was few and 
far between.
Sparked by a reaching, 
21-yard catch by tight end 

Zach Gentry on third down, 
Michigan 
kept 
its 
first 
drive of the half alive. It 
culminated with Patterson, 
given all day to throw, toying 
with the Rutgers defense 
on a broken play to find 
Oliver Martin for a 16-yard 
touchdown.
“The pocket awareness, 
finding where the quiet spot 
is — he looked as good as he’s 
ever looked tonight in the 
pocket,” Harbaugh said of 
Patterson. “Not panicking, 
moving suddenly, getting to 
the quiet spot.”
The Scarlet Knights ran 
a trick reverse pass later in 
the quarter which landed 
into the arms of backup 
quarterback 
Giovanni 
Rescigno for 17 yards.
Then 
Rutgers 
fumbled 
the ball away the next play. 
Then it punted the following 
series. Then it punted again.
Between 
these 
series, 
the Wolverines found the 
endzone off a 10-yard, back 
shoulder fade to Collins and 
a 61-yard run up the middle 
by Chris Evans.
“It 
was 
a 
one-on-one 
matchup,” Collins said of his 
second 
touchdown. 
“Shea 
just trusted me to make 
a play and that’s what we 
did. We like the matchup, 
and we’re gonna take that 
chance.”
A runaway win was hardly 
out of the question, even if 
the result and gameplay was 
uninspiring. 
The 
defense 
allowed 
just 
59 
passing 
yards, but 193 rushing yards. 
The 
offense 
dropped 
42 
points on the road, but was 
hardly reminiscent of the 
78-0 victory from 2016.
Lessons from the game 
can 
be 
interpreted 
any 
which way, but one thing 
still stands — Michigan just 
had to get through this game 
as it awaits its next big test 
at the end of the season in 
Ohio State.
“I feel like we need to stop 
coming out slow, but we still 
got the win,” Collins said.
It’s the perfect explanation 
of Saturday’s game.

Teammates make Gary proud in homecoming

PISCATAWAY — With a 
loosened brace draped over his 
right shoulder, Rashan Gary 
peered at the stat sheet on the 
podium in front of him. 
“Pssst,” Gary muttered to no 
one in particular. “It’s great to 
be a Michigan Wolverine.”
The junior defensive end, 
in fact, repeated that phrase 
four times throughout his 
postgame press conference. 
On Saturday, it must have been 
“great” indeed.
The Michigan football team 
bludgeoned Rutgers for the 
fourth time in as many years 
under coach Jim Harbaugh, 
this time winning, 42-7. It was 
a celebratory homecoming for 
numerous New Jersey natives 
on the Wolverines’ roster, 
including Gary — an alumnus 
of Paramus Catholic High 
School. 
But just a month ago, Gary’s 
return 
to 
his 
home 
state 
was in question. He missed 
three October games with an 
AC joint injury in his right 
shoulder, and rumors swirled 
that he might end his collegiate 
career before the season’s end.
After all, the former No. 1 
overall recruit’s talent had 
never been in question. Gary 
could have been a high pick in 
the 2019 NFL Draft without 
playing 
another 
snap 
for 
Michigan — in the same vein 
as Ohio State defensive end 
Joey Bosa.
But 
tucked 
inside 
the 
underbelly of Highpoint.com 
Stadium on Saturday, it became 
clear why Gary did not take 
that route.
Gary’s reaction to the stat 
sheet in front of him was 
not 
some 
self-aggrandizing 
remark. Four tackles and one 
quarterback hit against the 
Scarlet Knights, though a solid 
performance, is not going to 
make his name jump on NFL 
Draft boards.

So why was Gary so elated?
“I 
just 
like 
seeing 
my 
brothers, man, just seeing what 
my brothers are able to do,” 
Gary said. “It’s ridiculous. I’m 
just happy to 
see my brothers 
eat. That just 
shows us as a 
team — looking 
at the stat sheet 
— 
that 
we’re 
improving 
individually 
and as a team.”
The 
most 
noteworthy 
of those stats 
was Karan Higdon’s 44 yards, 
which put the senior running 
back 
over 
the 
1000-yard 
mark just nine games into his 
season.
When that was brought to 
Gary’s attention, he pumped 
his fist repeatedly. It was a 
benchmark Higdon had been 
hankering to eclipse, and Gary 

certainly knew it.
Minutes 
later, 
junior 
quarterback Shea Patterson 
uttered a statement he has not 
been coy to share.
“I 
don’t 
think I’ve ever 
been a part of 
a 
team 
that’s 
been this close,” 
Patterson said.
Yeah, 
that 
is as cliché as 
it gets — the 
types of things 
Michigan 
coaches 
would 
want Patterson 
to say publicly.
But it feels genuine because 
Gary is exhibit A.
Insurance 
policies 
are 
an inevitability these days, 
but Gary is literally risking 
millions 
of 
dollars 
by 
continuing to play for the 
Wolverines. He has ground 
to gain in mock drafts, sure, 

but all it takes is one play for 
things to go really south.
But Gary said he never 
considered leaving.
“I’m out there with my 
brothers,” 
Gary 
said. 
“I’m 
having 
fun 
flying 
around. 
Being around these guys, they 
give me energy.
“Tell me how (my shoulder) 
looks.”
Gary then moved his arms 
around rapidly, from side to 
side and up and down, like 
he was practicing some faux-
karate moves.
The shoulder looked fine — 
both then and during the game 
he chose to play in.
“That’s a testament to his 
character,” 
Patterson 
said. 
“He could have easily sat the 
rest of the season out and kept 
his goals and dreams for a few 
months, but it’s all about the 
team.
“That’s just what makes 
Rashan, Rashan.”

Higdon finally gets his coveted 1,000 yards

PISCATAWAY 
— 
Karan 
Higdon knew how close he was 
to the 1,000-yard mark for the 
season.
After all, just this summer 
he sat at Big Ten Media Days 
and said he would have entered 
the NFL Draft had he crossed 
the 1,000-yard threshold in 
2017-18. So the senior running 
back had to have known that 
his two-yard carry late in 
the second quarter against 
Rutgers on Saturday got him 
over the milestone. 
Yet, for the most part, 
Higdon kept it to himself.
When 
asked 
about 
the 
milestone after the Michigan 
football team dominated the 
Scarlet Knights, 42-7, junior 
defensive end Rashan Gary 
said he hadn’t heard Higdon 
mention it this season.
“I feel like Karan, he had a 
goal in his head,” Gary said. 
“He said it last year. There’s 
no reason to keep talking 
about it. You know, the season 
went on, he kept getting better 
and 
better 
— 
progressing, 
progressing. You know, he 
attacked his goal, and we knew 
it was coming by the way he 
worked and by the way he 
leads the team. So, you know, 
I’m happy for him.”
Gary’s statement is a team-
wide response. Well, almost all 
of it.
The 
team-
wide 
part: 
Anybody 
can 
see 
the 
improvements 
Higdon 
has 
made 
this 
season. 
Until 
Saturday, he had 
seven-straight 
100-yard games. 
His 
teammates 
clearly respect him, or they 
wouldn’t have named him one 
of four captains before the 
season.
The 
other 
part 
— 
that 
Higdon kept his yearning for 
the milestone a secret — isn’t 
entirely true. At the very least, 

he mentioned his quest for 
1,000 yards to redshirt junior 
tight end Zach Gentry, one of 
his close friends on the team 
and one of the players who 
would be blocking for Higdon 
on Saturday.
“He 
was 
talking 
about 
it 
before 
today’s game,” 
Gentry 
said. 
“He was like, 
‘We’ve 
gotta 
get 
me 
over 
that 
1,000-
yards 
mark.’ 
And that was 
a big, kind of, 
incentive for the offensive line 
to go out there and make sure 
we’re getting all of our blocks, 
because we do care about 
Karan and he has earned that. 
So we wanted to get him over 
that hump.
“Oh yeah, he said that today, 

and I said, ‘We’ve got you. I’ll 
be blocking for you.’ ”
For as inspiring as Higdon is 
to his teammates, the run that 
broke his season total into four 
figures was far from the most 
inspired Higdon 
has 
produced 
this year.
He 
took 
a 
simple 
handoff 
on 
3rd-and-5 
and didn’t come 
close to the first 
down. In fact, the 
run was a part 
of an uninspired 
performance 
for 
Higdon, 
in 
comparison to what he has 
done the rest of the season.
Higdon finished with just 42 
yards on 15 carries, though he 
did punch in two touchdowns.
Still, 
what 
Higdon 
did 
against Rutgers was enough to 
push him past 1,000 yards.

“It’s 
unbelievable,” 
said 
junior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson. “It’s really cool, 
especially, you know, going — 
we went with him in the spring 
and summer and saw all the 
hard work he 
put in. And, 
you know, he’s 
such a pivotal 
leader on this 
team. So just 
to 
see 
him 
accomplish 
that 
goal, 
it’s 
amazing, 
because 
we 
all know how 
hard 
he’s 
worked to get it.”
Perhaps that work in the 
offseason was a product of 
what 
Higdon 
mentioned 
in July. If Gentry is to be 
believed, Higdon has been 
thinking about his 1,000 yards 
since then.

On the other side, 

familiar misery
P

ISCATAWAY — Amid 
the bitter chill and doz-
ens of 
devoted (or 
delusional) 
fans, the 
clock slowly 
winds 
Saturday’s 
game to a 
close. The 
scoreboard 
reads: 
“Michigan, 
42. Rutgers, 7”. 
As the Scarlet Knights 
scamper for a first down, the 
PA announcer chimes in with 
a hearty “That’s a Rutgers… 
FIRST DOWN!” Two plays 
later, Wolverines sophomore 
cornerback Ambry Thomas 
intercepts a pass from Scarlet 
Knights quarterback Artur Sit-
kowski. 
“We can still win!” yells a 
member of the Rutgers band. 
The last two remaining brave 
souls in the front row don-
ning scarlet hold up three fin-
gers. They boast ironic smiles 
as a Michigan third down 
approaches with under a min-
ute left in the game. 
Devotion, delusion, what’s 
really the difference? Fandom 
requires plenty of both. 
The game comes to a merci-
ful close, Rutgers notching its 
33rd conference loss since join-
ing the Big Ten in 2014. Play-
ers share pleasantries. Some 
search for their families. 
Then the two programs walk 
down the tunnel at the same 
time, diverting into polar oppo-
site paths.
On one side of the locker 
room is a 
program blos-
soming into a 
national jug-
gernaut. With 
the win, the 
Wolverines 
marched one 
week closer to 
a potential Big 
Ten title and 
College Foot-
ball Playoff 
appearance.
“It’s great to be a Michigan 
Wolverine right now,” said 
junior defensive end Rashan 
Gary “That’s all I got to say.”
On the other, a team slowly 
crawling toward season’s end. 
The Rutgers team meeting 
room is littered with motiva-
tional quotes and checklists, 
as if offering a plea rather than 
encouragement.
One — posted in between the 
meeting rooms, covering a full 
wall — lists special teams goals 
that have been met or failed to 
have been met in each game. 
Another includes a four-step 
“plan to win.”
Rutgers coach Chris Ash 
starts his press conference by 
thanking reporters for coming, 
and you truly believe him.
“Coming into the game 
(Michigan was) playing as good 
as anybody in the country,” 
Ash said. “Playing a team like 
that, you’ve got to play almost 
perfect football. We made some 
mistakes in all three phases of 
the game to let that score get 
the way it did.”
He laments many of those 
mistakes. His team threw for 

just 59 yards — 19 of which 
came via a running back. His 
defense stopped just four of 
Michigan’s 12 third down 
attempts. In the end, what was 
a 7-7 game after the first quar-
ter spiraled into the 42-7 blow-
out everyone expected.
He also lists achievements. 
He was proud to have been able 
to run for 193 yards against 
a stout Wolverines front. He 
thinks his team held up well in 
the trenches.
There was a moment late in 
the first quarter, when Scarlet 
Knights running back Isaih 
Pacheco scampered 80 yards to 
tie the game at seven, and cast 
just a shadow of doubt on this 
forgone conclusion.
The crowd was giddy. The 
players jumped around. Positiv-
ity — a foreign feeling to many 
— spread around the stadium.
“I felt like we’ve been there 
before,” Pacheco said, on the 
feeling around the team after 
the score. “This is a play we 
could do to any team. We’ve 
just gotta all play together.”
Sitkowski felt a heightened 
belief, too. Maybe, just maybe, 
this one-win football team 
could pull off the unthinkable.
“We believed as soon as we 
stepped foot on that field, man. 
We believed. We all believed. 
We’ve believed since we saw 
Michigan on our schedule,” 
Sitkowski said. “No matter 
what was going to happen we 
all believed in each other. It 
never crossed our mind. When 
Isaih hit that run, I tell ya, we 
were all excited. It shows that 
we can do it, man. We can do 
anything we put our minds to 
in life.”
The Wolver-
ines rattled off 
35 unanswered 
the rest of the 
game — and Rut-
gers returned to 
its interminable 
stasis of misery. 
Michigan junior

Shea Patterson 
largely did as he 
pleased, completing 18-of-27 
passes for 260 yards and three 
touchdowns in three tidy quar-
ters of work. Sitkowski finished 
a beleaguered 8-of-19 for 40 
yards and an interception. This 
is nothing new for Rutgers. 
This was just Saturday.
After being asked a generic 
question about his team’s per-
formance, Sitkowski responds 
with a 15-second answer that 
includes the phrase “we played 
hard” five times.
In fairness, what is there left 
to say? His team hasn’t won a 
conference game in over a full 
calendar year. Since joining the 
conference in 2014, Rutgers has 
routinely served as the doormat 
of the Big Ten. Saturday eve-
ning was just the next in line of 
beatdowns and humiliations.

Ruiz emerges from the scrum 
of players after the game and 
walks up to Rutgers offensive 
lineman Micah Clark.
Clark lets out a sigh and a 
smile. He needs not say more.

‘M’ topples Mount St. Mary’s, 88-40

On the first possession of 
the game, freshman guard 
Amy Dilk lobbed a pass from 
the 
right 
wing 
to 
senior 
forward Hallie Thome in the 
paint.
Thome failed to convert, but 
it didn’t matter. Sophomore 
forward Hailey Brown was 
there to grab the rebound and 
get her team on the board.
That opening play was a 
preview of how most of the 
game would turn out. The 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team (1-0) used its physical 
advantage to defeat Mount 
St. Mary’s (1-1), 88-40, Friday 
night at Crisler Center.
Offensively, the Wolverines 
pushed the tempo from the 
start. This sense of urgency 
didn’t 
result 
in 
success 
immediately, though, as the 
team missed quite a few early 
shots.
For instance, Brown had a 
couple unsuccessful attempts 
during the first few minutes. 
However, she kept attacking 
and the persistence paid off as 
she finished with 14 points.
“At the beginning of the 
game, I mean, my shot, it 
wasn’t falling,” Brown said. 
“So, if you’re a shooter and 
your shots aren’t falling, the 
next option is to drive.”
Five minutes into the first 
quarter, Dilk dished another 
effortless lob to Thome. And 
this time around, she scored. 
Thome dominated all night 
with her post play and led the 
team with 25 points and 10 
rebounds.
“She knows the game so 
well. It’s fun to definitely 
play with someone who has 
that much of a basketball 
IQ,” Thome said of Dilk’s 
passing. “So, I know every 
time the guards give me the 
ball, they’re putting me in the 
best position to score. So, the 
credit is all to them.”
Despite 
its 
offensive 
success, Michigan’s defense 
took time to settle in. This 
resulted in wide-open shots 
for the Mountaineers, who 

capitalized to stay in the 
game. The Wolverines led 
12-11 heading into the first 
media timeout.
Freshman 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon and junior forward 
Kayla Robbins hopped on the 
court after the break. The 
duo gave Michigan the spark 
it needed to start putting the 
game away. The Wolverines 
soon went on a 7-0 run 
extending into the second 
quarter, 
and 
resulted 
in 
Michigan taking a 43-29 edge 
into the locker room.
Mount St. Mary’s defense 
had no answer for the rest 
of 
the 
game. 
At 
6-feet, 
junior Alexis Wooden was 
the 
Mountaineers’ 
tallest 
starter, thus they often had to 
double-team the Wolverines 
to compensate for the height 
disadvantage.
Michigan 
responded 
frequently 
with 
effective 
passing to find whoever was 
was left unguarded. The team’s 
solid 
ball 
movement 
also 
helped it excel in transition. 
In addition to Thome and 
Brown, Hillmon and senior 
guard Nicole Munger reached 
double digits in scoring with 

10 and 12 points, respectively.
The 
height 
mismatch 
significantly 
helped 
the 
Wolverines with rebounding 
as well. Michigan finished the 
game with 46 total rebounds, 
while 
Mount 
St. 
Mary’s 
grabbed 26.
As the lead grew bigger, 
the 
Wolverines 
expanded 
their rotation. Junior guard 
Akienreh Johnson was the 
only Michigan player who 
didn’t get playing time, as she’s 
recovering from an injury.
Even the newcomers found 
time on the court, as freshmen 
made 
fair 
contributions. 
Midway through the third 
frame, Hillmon fought for 
a loose ball near half court, 
pleasing both the crowd and 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico.
“How ‘bout the spark she 
brought, huh?” Barnes Arico 
proclaimed. “She just brought 
a level of intensity and just 
dialed it up for us.”
Favored headed into the 
match, the Wolverines were 
expected to win and did just 
that. However, there is still 
an entire season to go for the 
Wolverines.

Michigan falls to Notre Dame, 6-2, in rematch for series split

A 
hockey 
game 
lasts 
60 
minutes.
Three periods of 20, two 
breaks in between.
Sixty minutes is what Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson expected 
from the No. 14 Michigan hockey 
team 
in 
Saturday’s 
matchup 
against No. 6 Notre Dame.
Forty, or two periods, is what 
he got, more or less.
The Wolverines fell to the 
Fighting Irish, 6-2, despite what 
Pearson thought was a good start 
to the game.
“I thought we were really 
ready to play tonight,” Pearson 
said. “I thought great start, one 
of the best starts maybe we had 
this year, we were all over them, 
created 
some 
great 
scoring 
opportunities, didn’t give them 
much.”
There are often question marks 
for a team after a successful bout 
— especially with the Michigan 
hockey team.
Throughout the season, every 
time the Wolverines have started 
to be successful, they have fallen 
under the trap of losing focus and 
taking things for granted.
When 
Michigan 
beat 
St. 
Lawrence on Oct. 26 - 27 for 
its first weekend sweep of the 
season, the team went on to lose, 
5-2, to Lake Superior State the 
following weekend. Sophomore 
Michael Pastujov noted they 
weren’t ready going into that 
matchup.
So the big question for the 
Wolverines was about whether 
Michigan was hungry enough 
to play a full 60 minutes in its 
rematch over Notre Dame, like 
Pearson thought they had during 
Friday’s 2-1 win.
The short answer is no.
To begin the game, however, 
the Wolverines didn’t skip a beat 
from its game the day before, 
going aggressively to the net 
and playing as equally physical. 
Lockwood opened the period 
with a shot on net after initiating 

a well-crafted attack to set the 
tone. The shot didn’t go in, but it 
was a warning for Notre Dame to 
be ready.
And 
soon 
after, 
senior 
defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi 
drew 
a 
penalty. 
Michigan 
saw 
success 
on 
the 
power 
play 
Friday, 
converting 
its 
first 
two, 
and 
tonight was no 
different.
In 
the 
dwindling 
stretches 
of 
the power play, 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Quinn 
Hughes 
shot 
a 
pass 
towards traffic. Junior forward 
Will Lockwood, who was in the 
midst of battling for position, 
tipped the puck and created the 
early 1-0 lead.
And the great start Pearson 

saw from the team was nearly 
capped off by a second goal.
Cecconi had wrapped around 
the 
net 
and 
found 
Hughes 
lingering around the crease. 
Hughes then passed the puck 
across ice to Norris, who was 
waiting 
at 
the 
other side of the 
net and tapped 
the puck in.
The 
goal, 
however, 
was 
called back due to 
offsides.
“It’s the right 
call,” 
Pearson 
said. “But if that 
goes in, it’s 2-0, 
and we had them 
on their heels, and that just gives 
you a little more momentum.”
The overturned call marked 
the turning point of not just 
Michigan’s momentum, but its 
efforts as well.
Michigan, who had been so 

stout defensively, began to loosen 
up. Notre Dame found its first 
high-danger 
attempt 
stopped 
by junior goaltender Hayden 
Lavigne, who extended his leg to 
stop the rebound from turning 
into an easy open-net goal.
Then, 
the 
goaltending 
heroics 
ended 
shortly after that.
The 
Fighting 
Irish scored, and 
did it quickly.
“Basically 
a 
couple 
bad 
decisions, 
a 
couple easy goals 
at the end of the 
first 
period,” 
Pearson said. “We go from that 
lead, almost two nothing, it was 
offside, tough break for us, good 
break for them.
“But again, we gave up two 
goals within two minutes to end 
the first, and then we gave up 

three goals in four minutes to 
start the second period. And that 
was the game.”
To put it simply, the Wolverines 
were demoralized after Notre 
Dame’s two goals.
In hopes of turning the tides 
back to how they 
originally were, 
Pearson switched 
goaltenders, 
bringing 
in 
freshman 
goaltender 
Strauss Mann.
Mann 
had 
held Notre Dame 
to 
only 
one 
goal in Friday’s 
matchup, 
and 
in order to weather the storm, 
Pearson hoped he’d replicate his 
performance.
However, a few more bad 
bounces, and the Wolverines 
were only further behind.
“You have to continue to 

stay in the game,” Pearson said. 
“What happens usually when a 
team scores is it give them a lift. 
And that’s what really (ignited) 
Notre Dame.
“Even the third goal, I think 
the third goal was sort of a real 
backbreaker, just an innocent 
shot behind net and they through 
it out front and it goes in. It got 
away from us, in a hurry.”
The best way to get back into 
a game, mentally and literally, 
is to score. And toward the end 
of the second, an opportunity 
presented itself — a five-on-three 
situation. As Cecconi put it, score 
there, and the game changes.
But Michigan couldn’t.
And despite ending the second 
period on a further disheartening 
play, a goal off of a deflection, the 
Wolverines came into the third 
period in full spirit.
“I think we all knew that 
the second period was pretty 
embarrassing,” 
Cecconi 
said. 
“And that’s not Michigan hockey, 
that’s not how we want to play. 
And some of the guys talked in 
the locker room pretty much just 
decided that everyone was going 
to play their game and compete.”
The third period brought a 
familiar look, an aggressive and 
gritty team that was ready to play 
and aiming to win.
Despite 
only 
mustering 
one goal, a shot between the 
goaltender’s leg from freshman 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg, 
the Wolverines outshot Notre 
Dame 15-4 in the final period and 
played a style they thought better 
reflected their quality of hockey.
“We talked about a standard 
of play,” Pearson said. “There’s a 
certain standard of play that we 
need to have each and every night 
here at Michigan and I think they 
just got back to that.
“I think once you chase a 
game and you get behind, you 
have a tendency to get away, try 
to do some things maybe too 
individualistic instead of trying 
to stay within the team concept. 
We just wanted to get back to that 
and just work our defense.”

Freshman guard Amy Dilk played in her first game as a Wolverine on Friday.

Wolverines beat Holy Cross, 56-37

For 20 minutes, Michigan’s 
offense 
was 
dead 
and 
its 
defense was porous. For 20 
minutes, Holy Cross posed 
questions 
the 
Wolverines 
couldn’t answer.
Then 
the 
second 
half 
happened.
It 
wasn’t 
always 
easy 
— 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball team (2-0 overall) 
often struggled against the 
Crusaders 
(1-1) 
and 
their 
Princeton 
offense 
and 
matchup-zone defense — but 
the Wolverines pulled away in 
the second half for a 56-37 win.
Both teams traded missed 
shots back and forth to start — 
neither scored until freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
made a free throw with 17:08 
remaining in the first. Then, 
they swapped baskets, with an 
inside jumper from Brazdeikis 
giving Michigan an early 9-5 
advantage.
But the Wolverines didn’t 
score for almost four more 
minutes. To make matters 
worse, defensive lapses led to 
three open treys for Holy Cross 
to put the Crusaders up 18-9 at 
the under-12 timeout.
A few minutes later, redshirt 
junior wing Charles Matthews 
hit a 3-pointer off a turnover 
to narrow Holy Cross’ lead to 
four, but for the rest of the half 
— over 10 minutes — Michigan’s 
only points came off free 
throws from Matthews, Livers 
and sophomore guard Jordan 
Poole. Going into halftime, the 
Crusaders led 24-18.
“(Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beliein) was just telling us 
to be calm, this is what we 
expected,” 
Brazdeikis 
said. 
“We prepared for this team 
very well. We knew they were 
gonna be in a matchup zone. 
And we knew they were gonna 
play a slow-paced game. But 
he was just saying, attack the 
seams, make our shots and 
make good plays.”
And after the half, the 
Wolverines started to make 
those plays. Brazdeikis led the 
charge with two layups, a trey, 

four free throws and a mid-
range jumper in the first five 
minutes. When junior center 
Jon Teske received a pass from 
junior guard Zavier Simpson, 
beat his lone defender to the 
basket and threw down a dunk, 
it felt like the momentum had 
shifted.
“We really changed what we 
were doing offensively,” Beilein 
said. “We were probably trying 
to do too much, trying to create 
leverage, and we just really 
simplified our attack in the 
second half. And just tried to, 
just go off penetration.”
In the second half it was 
Holy Cross that couldn’t buy 
a bucket. The Crusaders went 
seven minutes without scoring 
and struggled to even get a 
shot off due to Michigan’s 
stifling defense. Holy Cross 
scored just 13 points in the half 
and committed nine turnovers.
“(We got) some open shots 
and some easy baskets, and 
they 
were 
missing 
some 
things that maybe normally 
they make in the first half,” 

said Holy Cross coach Bill 
Carmody. “And then the second 
half they just, they turned 
up the heat. … We had some 
empty possessions on offense 
and then we just weren’t able 
to handle anything with the 
pressure.”
It was still ugly at times for 
the Wolverines. But Matthews 
and Brazdeikis took a more 
aggressive approach than they 
had at the beginning and it 
paid off, as they finished with 
20 and 19 points, respectively. 
And even when its shooting 
was 
off, 
Michigan’s 
uncharacteristically 
good 
performance on free throws 
kept the lead comfortable. 
Brazdeikis, 
especially, 
took 
advantage, going 8-for-8 from 
the charity stripe.
For the final 20 minutes, 
Michigan’s defense stole the 
show while the offense did just 
enough to hold up its end of the 
deal.
And for the final 20 minutes, 
it was the Crusaders who 
couldn’t find any answers.
