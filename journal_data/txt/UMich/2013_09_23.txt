At Big House, innovations abound

MHacks moves to
Michigan Stadium
for largest student
hackathon in U.S.
ByAMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily StaffReporter
It wasn't game day, but the Big
House was bustling.
The MHacks hackathon, a

competitive weekend of non-stop
programming, is a collaboration
of Michigan Hackers and MPow-
ered, an entrepreneurship group,
where "hackers" from universi-
ties worldwide filled the stadium
- a location chosen after the
2012 hackathon outgrew Palmer
Commons. At MHacks, students
collaborated to churn out innova-
tions between Friday night and
Sunday morning.
The rules are simple: The
hackers are be given exactly 36

hours to create an application
programming interface - which
specifies how some software
components should interact with
each other - and present it at
an expo for the chance to win a
series of prizes.
With nearly three times the
number of participants as the
2012 hackathon, the 2013 event
surpassed world records for
hackathon attendance, as 1,700
tickets for the event sold out in
less than 24 hours. The previous

record was set early September at
PennApps, the annual hackathon
hosted at the University of Penn-
sylvania that boasted a record
1,000 attendees.
Though much of the partici-
pants' time was spent developing
apps, they were provided with
ample food and drink, and were
even able to watch the Univer-
sity's football game against the
University of Connecticut on the
stadium screens.
As it neared closer to 11 p.m.

Saturday, a class of student par-
ticipants turned to sleep and
social media after failing to effec-
tively debug failed applications.
Others, however, inched closer to
finishing and implementing last-
minute functionalities - Bing-
hamton University senior David
Lui included.
"You are competing against
the others here, butI don't think
of it that way until the end," Lui
said. "Right now it's more of a
social collaborative event."

Lui created an application
that would determine a user's
inherent biases through a per-
sonalized series of questions.
He said being able to participate
in a hackathon hosted in the Big
House was a perk.
At the expo following the
hackathon, application develop-
ers had the opportunity to com-
pete for a total of $23,000 in cash
prizes.

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
For the Daily
Even after University alum
Zachary Petroni explains in
native Kiswahili that he is a

the small Kenyan town of Gede

them, Petroni is like any other

Petroni said withstanding
this reaction has been his big-

"tropical heat" and "de-indus-

the Ford School of Public Policy,
is the inaugural winner of the fel-
lowship, which grants $25,000 to
a graduating senior each year to
pursue an independent learnings
or exploration project anywhere
in the world. He wrote in an
e-mail interview that his overall
objective is "interrogating the
linkages between how conser-
vation spaces are constructed
and governed ... and the conse-
quences of this decision-making
on the socio-economic, cultural
and political well-being of people
living in close proximity to such
efforts."

Rolling out the green carpet
to spark urban-space debate

ANN ARBOR
City council
reconsiders
crosswalk
regulations
Council members
concerned about
ambiguous law
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily Staff Reporter
In light of the death of a stu-
dent early August at a Plymouth
Road crosswalk, Ann Arbor's
current crosswalk ordinance has
raised questions among the pub-
lic and City Council as many leg-
islators are working to revise or
repeal the ordinance.
When the current law was
passed in 2012, it was considered
an improvement over the previ-
ous ordinance, which required
drivers to stop for pedestrians
"approaching" the crosswalk.
Some considered the wording too
ambiguous to follow or enforce.
Today, Ann Arbor has an
ordinance that is distinct from
the Michigan Uniform Traffic
Code. A memorandum to coun-
cilmembers from Nick Hutchin-
son, manager of the city's Project
Management Unit, illustrated
the differences in the word-
ing of the two laws. The MUTC

From a rolled-out strip of

Public Health student Arielle
Fleisher invited a passerby
into her makeshift "park."

On Friday, Fleisher and
Rackham student Jenny Coo-

part of PARK(ing) Day 2013,
an annual program that cre-
ates temporary green spaces

The duo received permis-

the South State Street Cor-

11 a.m. Local businesses even
contributed to the parklet's

creation: Downtown Home
and Garden donated furniture
and potted plants, the Pro-

bench and the Lunch Room
provided lunch for the group.
Other expenses were cov-

NCAA basketball ban lifted

Ten years ago this week
(Sept.25,2003):
The NCAA's postsea-
son ban on Michigan's bas-
ketball program was lifted.
The ban, along with four
years of probation and the loss
of one scholarship per year,
was put into place after the
NCAA learned four players
accepted more than $600,000
from Ed Martin during the
1990s. The organization also
demanded those four play-
ers be dissociated from
the University for 10 years.
Thomas Yeager, former chair
of the NCAA Committee on
Infractions, said the infrac-
tion was "one of the three or

four most egregious violations
of the NCAA bylaws in the his-
tory of the association." How-
ever, the NCAA Infractions
Appeals Committee decided the
postseason ban was excessive.
Thirty years ago this week
(Sept.23,1983):
Ann Arbor Public Schools
teachers ended a 16-day
strike and returned to class-
rooms, reluctantly accepting
a 2.5-percent wage increase.
Ann Arbor teachers' sala-
ries ranked 75th among the
500 Michigan school dis-
tricts, though most felt the
2.5-percent pay raise was
"grossly inadequate," accord-

ing to Dean Bodley, former
vice president of the Ann
Arbor Education Association.
Sixty years ago this week
(Sept.26,1953):
The University's Board of
Regents approved a $2.7-mil-
lion expenditure to provide
additional student housing
over two years. The approval
allowed the University to file
preliminary applications with
a federal agency for loans to
cover the cost of construction.
The other $1 million went
toward the construction of 100
married-student housing units.

Obama calls for gun reform in
wake of Navy Yard shooting

UMPD chief promoted
to security and safetyjob

President says fight
for gun laws 'ought
to obsess us'
WASHINGTON (AP) -
President Barack Obama on
Sunday memorialized the victims
of the Washington Navy Yard
shooting by urging Americans
not to give up on a transformation
in gun laws that he argued are to
blame for an epidemic of violence.
"There is nothing inevitable
about it - it comes about because
of decisions we make or fail to
make," Obama said.
Reprising his role of the nation's
consoler in chief after yet another
mass shooting, Obama issued a call
to action on gun control measures
that failed to pass earlier this year
and show no new momentum in
the wake of last week's rampage at
a military installation just blocks
from the Capitol.
"Our tears are not enough,"
Obama told thousands gathered

killed in last Monday's shooting,
speaking from the parade
grounds at the Marine Barracks,
a site personally selected by
Thomas Jefferson because of
its close marching distance to

service came on the first day
of fall, which shone brightly in
Washington, with sun sparkling
off the instruments being played
by the Navy Band and the gold
dress uniform buttons worn by so
many in the crowd.
The invitation-only crowd
included around 4,000 mourners,
with the victims' tearful, black-
clad family members directly in
front of the speakers' stage. The
president and first lady Michelle
Obama met privately with the
families before the service, White
House officials said.

Piersante will take
role as DPSS C00
and director of
security services
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
ManagingNews Editor
In another step in the con-
tinuing reorganization of the
University's security agencies,
University Police Chief Joe
Piersante has been named chief
operations officer of the Divi-
sion of Public Safety and Secu-
rity and director of University
Security Services.
Piersante will continue in
his position until a new chief
has been selected. The Spel-
man and Johnson Group, a
search firm that specializes
in higher education, has been
hired to assist in the search for
a replacement.
When Piersante first took
the top post, the University's
Police force was known as the
Department of Public Safety.
He first served as interim exec-
utive director of public safety
in February 2011, when former
director Ken Magee went on
sick leave.
Later that year, he again
assumed the role of executive
director on an interim basis
after former chief Greg O'Dell
returned to his previous job as
director of public safety and
chief of police at Eastern Michi-
gan University. O'Dell commit-
ted suicide just a month later.
For most of the last two
years, Piersante has prevailed
over a law enforcement orga-
nization that has been partly
blamed for serious communi-
cation issues, and as a result,
the agency has gone through
immense change, including the
formation of the Division of
Public Safety and Security to

unite Housing Security, Hos-
pital Security, and Police under
one umbrella organization.
As DPSS COO and USS
director, Piersante will over-
see several different major
security initiatives, including
infrastructure management,
museums security, coordina-
tion of safety and security
efforts for major events, con-
tract security and adminis-
tration of the University's 911
Communications Center.
In a statement released Fri-
day, DPSS executive director
Eddie Washington, Jr. praised
Piersante's work both as chief
and as interim director of DPSS.
"I'm very appreciative of the
many years of successful service
that Joe has made to the uni-
versity and to the police depart-
ment," Washington said. "When
the new division was formed
last fall, Joe willingly took on
the additional role to lead the
transition. I'm grateful that his
leadership will continue to ben-
efit our community through our
campus security efforts."
Washington said DPSS
has now chosen to appoint a
new chief because Piersante's
expertise is needed at a strate-
gic level.
"As the new Division has
continued to evolve, we rec-
ognized a greater need at the
Division level for Joe's exper-
tise," Washington said. "To
meet the strategic plans and
goals of the Division and the
Police Department, we needed
to expand Joe's role."
The job posting notes that a
successful candidate for UMPD
chief must have a bachelor's
degree, leadership experience
in law enforcement and, among
other things, an understanding
of student life. The posting does
not detail exactly how much
experience a qualified candi-
date should have.
Spelman and Johnson Group

will be compensated one-
third of the first year salary of
the new UMPD chief, which
could range from $150,000 to
$160,000, according to officials.
Andy Burchfield, the Uni-
versity's director of emergency
management, will serve as
chair of the search commit-
tee. In addition, the following
people will serve on the com-
mittee:
" AAPD Deputy Chief Greg
Bazick
" DPSS executive assistant
Lori Blough
" Jeffery Frumkin, associate
vice provost in academic affairs
" Sabrina Garrett-Owens,

tions in U-M Human Resources

Ann Arbor city
council considers
divestment
The Ann Arbor City Council is
considering a proposal to sell off
fossil fuel-linked investments in
its $429 million municipal pen-
sion plan.
The University of Michigan
campus community already
aims to make a 90 percent cut in
greenhouse gas emissions in the
city of 115,000 by 2050.
The city's Energy Commission
is urging the council to pass a
resolution directing the pension
board to sell holdings in the top
200 publicly traded fossil fuel
companies. The Ann Arbor News
says pension fund chief Nancy
Walker warns the move could
hurt the city financially.
The proposal has failed before

Organizers say the annual

provided more than 2 million
meals to hungry children in
southeastern Michigan.
The effort was coordinated by
Gleaners Community Food Bank
of Southeastern Michigan and
the Charter One Foundation.
They say the 2013 Hunger Free
Summer campaign raised more
money and distributed more
meals than the previous cam-
paigns.
According to officials with the
campaign, nearly 320,000 chil-
dren in southeastern Michigan
rely on free or reduced-fee meals
during the school year. When
the National School Lunch and

Pope Francis denounced what

"Where there is no work, there
is no dignity," he said.
Francis left aside his prepared
remarks and spoke off the cuff to
thousands of people in Sardinia's
capital, telling them he knew well
what it was like to suffer from
financial crisis. He recalled that
his Italian parents, who immi-
grated to Argentina before he
was born, spoke about it often at
home.
"My young father went to
Argentina full of illusions of mak-
ing it in America," a somber Fran-
cis told the crowd at the start of a
daylongvisit to the island. "And he
suffered the terrible crisis of the
1930s. They lost everything. There

previous grenade blast or gun-
fire volley.
Kenyan police said on Twit-
ter that security forces had
launched a "MAJOR" assault to
end the bloody siege.
"This will end tonight. Our
forces will prevail. Kenyans are
standing firm against aggres-
sion, and we will win," Kenya's
National Disaster Operation
Centre said on Twitter.
The Kenya Defense Forces
later said it had rescued "most"
hostages and had taken control
of most of the mall, though it did
not provide details.
Many of the rescued hos-
tages - mostly adults - were
suffering from dehydration, Col.
Cyrus Oguna, a military spokes-
man, told The Associated Press.
He refused to say how many
hostages were rescued or how
many were still being held. He
said some of the attackers had
"most probably" been killed in
the operation.
The assault came about 30
hours after 10 to 15 al-Shabab
extremists stormed the mall Sat-
urday from two sides, throwing

grenades and firing on civilians.
Loud exchanges of gunfire
rang out from inside the four-
story mall throughout Sunday.

in at least two rocket-propelled
grenades. Al-Shabab militants
reacted angrily to the helicop-
ters on Twitter and warned that
the Kenyan military action was
endangering hostages.
Kenyan authorities said they
would do their utmost to save
hostages' lives, but no officials
could say precisely how many
people were being held captive.
Kenya's Red Cross said ina state-
ment, citing police, that 49 peo-
ple had been reported missing.
Officials did not make an explicit
link but that number could give
an indication of the number of
people held captive.
Kenya's Red Cross said the
death toll rose to 68 after nine
bodies were recovered Sun-
day. More than 175 people were
injured, including many chil-
dren, Kenyan officials said.
Somalia's al-Qaida-linked
rebel group, al-Shabab, claimed
responsibility for the attack that
specifically targeted non-Mus-
lims, saying it was in retribution
for Kenyan forces' 2011 push into
neighboring Somalia.
U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry condemned what he called
"an enormous offense against
everybody's sense of right and
wrong," and called the attackers
"ruthless and completely reck-
less terrorists."
Kerry, who was in New York,
for meetings at the United
Nations, spoke Sunday with
Somalia's foreign minister and
U.N. ambassador.
State Department spokes-
woman Marie Harf said U.S. law
enforcement, military and civil-
ian personnel in Nairobi were
providing advice and assistance
to the Kenyan authorities. She

said five Americans were among
the scores of people injured in
the attack, but the U.S. had no
reports of any American deaths.
Earlier in the day, al-Shabab
said on its new Twitter feed -
after its previous one was shut
down Saturday - that Kenyan
officials were asking the hos-
tage-takers to negotiate and
offering incentives.
"We'll not negotiate with the
Kenyan govt as long as its forces
are invading our country, so reap
the bitter fruits of your harvest,"
al-Shabab said in a tweet.
Kenyan President Uhuru
Kenyatta, who lost a nephew
and the nephew's fiancee in the
attack, reiterated his govern-
ment's determination to contin-
ue fighting al-Shabab.
"We went as a nation into
Somalia to help stabilize the
country and most importantly
to fight terror that had been
unleashed on Kenya and the
world," said Kenyatta. "We shall
not relent on the war on terror."
Although this violent attack
had succeeded, the Kenyan lead-
er said, the country's security
forces had "neutralized" many
others.
FormerKenyanPrimeMinister
Raila Odinga told reporters that
"quite a number" of people were
being held hostage in two areas
of the sprawling complex, which
includes stores for such retail
giants as Nike, Adidas and Bose.
Many hostages were believed to
be in agrocery and general depart-
mentstore called Nakumatt.
Kenyan security officials
soughtto reassure the families of
hostages but implied that some of
those being held could be killed.
"The priority is to save as
many lives as possible," said Inte-
rior Cabinet Secretary Joseph
Lenku, adding that more than
1,000 people escaped the attack
inside the mall on Saturday.

1,500 students, 300
companies to take
over North Campus
By PAULA FRIEDRICH
Daily StaffReporter
After months of fielding more
than 100 e-mails per day, the
four directors of the Society of
Women Engineers and Tau Beta
Pi Career Fair are stepping back
to let recruiters and students
connect.
The annual SWE/TBP career
fair runs Monday through Tues-
day. The event typically attracts
about 1,500 students and 300
companies each year, but direc-
tors said even more were look-
ing for space.
"We basically take over
every single building on North
Campus," said Engineering
senior Emily Carroll, a mem-
ber of the University's chap-
ter of the Society of Women
Engineers and one of the fair's
directors.
That makes the SWE/TBP
fair the second-largest student-
run career fair in the country
for 2013, right behind Purdue's
Industrial Roundtable Career
Fair, which is also held for engi-
neers and attracted roughly 300
companies last year. It's also one
of the biggest fairs on campus -
the Career Center's biggest fair
is the Fall Expo, which brings in
about 140 companies.
"When you think about the
size of the events they're doing
and being able to do all the
logistics that are involved while
you are also a full-time student
is pretty amazing," said Sally
Schuenemann, the Career Cen-
ter's career events manager. ;
Schuenemann said loca-
tions often have to be reserved
almost two years in advance of
an event, making logistics the
most challenging partof putting
together a career fair.
Engineering senior Natalie

Eyke, one of the fair's directors
and a member of the Tau Beta
Pi, the University's engineering
honors society, said there are
a lot of things to stay on top of,
from making sure the caterer
is University-approved to orga-
nizing times for recruiters to
unload their gear.
But she said an adviser from
the Engineering Career Center
helps the student organizers
jump that hurdle.
"They are aware of resources
that we aren't necessarily aware
of," said Eyke.
Eyke said the fact that the
directors are students gives
them a beneficial perspective
that the University officials
might not have.
"We're more in touch with
other students," she said. "We
notonly know what we wanthbut
we can reach out to our friends
and say 'What are you looking
for?' more easilythan maybethe
University could."
That perspective resulted
in spreading out similar com-
panies across the space, so
students aren't professing
their desire to work for one
company only to do the same
within earshot of the another
recruiter.
That student perspective also
plays heavily in the prepara-
tion for the University's other
student-run fair, MPowered's
Startup Career Fair. MPow-
ered is a student-run group that
encourages student entrepre-
neurship.
"We spend a lot of time with
our team thinking 'How can we
make this a really great experi-
ence for the students?' " said
Engineering junior Natasja
Nielsen, a co-director of MPow-
ered's start-up fair.
Engineering senior Michael
Boyd, one of the SWE/TBP
career fair's directors, said a
strong reputation both within
and outside the University
makes it possible for students to
run a career fair.

Suicide bombers kill 78 people
in attack on church in Pakistan

Pair of bombers
linked with
Pakistani Taliban
PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP)
- A pair of suicide bombers
blew themselves up amid hun-
dreds of worshippers at a his-
toric church in northwestern
Pakistan on Sunday, killing 78
people in the deadliest-ever
attack against the country's
Christian minority.
A wing of the Pakistani Tali-
ban claimed responsibility for
the bombing, raising new ques-
tions about the government's
push to strike a peace deal with
the militants to end a decade-
'long insurgency that has killed
thousands of people.
The Jundullah arm of the
Taliban said they would contin-
ue to target non-Muslims until
the United States stopped drone
attacks in Pakistan's remote trib-
al region. The latest drone strike
came Sunday, when missiles hit a
pair of compounds in the North
Waziristan tribal area, killingsix
suspected militants.
The attack on the All Saints
Church, which wounded 141
people, occurred as worshippers
were leaving after services to get
a free meal of rice offered on the

front lawn, said a top govern-
ment administrator, Sahibzada
Anees.
"There were blasts and
there was hell for all of us,"
said Nazir John, who was at
the church in the city's Kohati
Gate district along with at least
400 other worshippers. "When
I got my senses back, I found
nothing but smoke, dust, blood
and screaming people. I saw
severed body parts and blood
all around."
Survivors wailed and hugged
one another in the wake of the
blasts. The white walls of the
church, which first opened in
the late 1800s, were pockmarked
with holes caused by ball bear-
ings contained in the bombs to
cause maximum damage. Blood
stained the floor and the walls.
Plates filled with rice were scat-
tered across the ground.
The attack was carried out by
two suicide bombers who deto-
nated their explosives almost
simultaneously, said police offi-
cer Shafqat Malik.
The 78 dead included 34
women and seven children, said
Interior Minister Chaudhry
Nisar Ali Khan. Another 37 chil-
dren were among the 141 wound-
ed, he said.
The number of casualties
from the blasts was so high that

the hospital ran short of caskets
for the dead and beds for the
wounded, said Mian Iftikhar
Hussain, a former information
minister of surrounding Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa province who was
on the scene.
"This is the deadliest attack
against Christians in our coun-
try," said Irfan Jamil, the bish-
op of the eastern city of Lahore.
Pope Francis led several
thousand people in a prayer for
the victims while on a visit to
Sardinia. Those who carried
out the attack, he said, "took the
wrong choice, one of hatred and
war."
One of the wounded, John
Tariq, who lost his father in
the attack, demanded of those
behind the bombing: "What
have we done wrong to these
people? Why are we being
killed?"
Ahmad Marwat, who iden-
tified himself as the spokes-
man for the Jundullah wing of
the Pakistani Taliban, claimed
responsibility for the attack.
"All non-Muslims in Paki-
stan are our target, and they
will remain our target as long
as America fails to stop drone
strikes in our country," Marwat
told The Associated Press by
telephone from an undisclosed
location.

Natural disaster
damages over 2,000
square miles
LONGMONT, Colo. (AP)
- State highway crews and
National Guard troops worked
furiously Sunday to repair
highways to Colorado moun-
tain towns cut off by unprec-
edented flooding.
Other teams were assessing
how much damage needed to
be repaired on Colorado's east-
ern plains before trucks begin
hauling in the fall harvest.
"They're reallyhumming,"said
Jerre Stead, the corporate execu-
tive chosen by Gov. John Hick-
enlooper to oversee the state's
recovery from the catastrophic
floods, which killed seven and
wreaked havoc across 17 counties
and 2,000 square miles.
Stead and Don Hunt, execu-
tive director of the Colorado
Department of Transportation,
said they were optimistic they
can meet a Dec. 1 target to com-
plete temporary fixes to at least
some roads, if more bad weath-
er doesn't interfere.
Quick repairs are critical
because winter weather will
make highway work more dif-
ficult and force the closure of
the high-elevation Trail Ridge
Road through Rocky Moun-
tain National Park, one of only
two routes still open into Estes
Park, a small town at the park's
east entrance.
Also looming are the harvests
from Colorado's $8.5 billion-a-
year agriculture industry, which
relies on trucks to get cattle and
crops to markets.
Officials said it's too early
to know how much time and
money it will take to make per-
manent repairs, but they say it
will cost more than $100 million.
Some 200 miles of state
highways and 50 bridges were
destroyed.
On Sunday, Stead and Hunt

drove up flood-battered U.S. 36
northwest of Denver until they
reached a point where floodwa-
ters had obliterated the roadway.
Then they got out and hiked.
Holding his hands about
shoulder-width apart, Stead
said, "You're on paths this nar-
row where the roads used to be."
Residents who chose not
to evacuate aboard National
Guard helicopters gave them
a lift at one point, Hunt said.
Those isolated residents can
drive along unscathed sections
of highway but cart reach
either Estes Park on the north
or Lyons on the south.
Hunt said residents of Pine-
wood Springs had built make-
shift trails along highway
washouts and planned to escort
some children along those paths
to waiting vehicles on Monday.
He didn't know how many
children were makingthe trek or
how far they would have to walk.
Stead said the devastation
was worse than he expected,
but Hunt was more optimistic.
"It's maybe not as bad as I
thought," he said. "The damage
is severe, but it's highly concen-
trated" in a few areas, mostly
where roads share a narrow
canyon with a river.
Hunt said the biggest diffi-
culties will be getting construc-
tion materials into damaged
areas and protecting workers
and travelers from falling rocks
loosened by days of heavy rain.
Colorado will award sev-
eral contracts for emergency
repairs to construction compa-
nies on Monday. State employ-
ees and National Guard soldiers
are already on the job and mak-
ing quick progress, Stead said.
The federal government will
reimburse the state up to $100
million for road repairs, CDOT
spokeswoman Amy Ford said,
but Colorado officials are push-
ing to raise that to $500 million,
which she said was the cap for
mid-Atlantic states rebuilding
after Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

Another change, no input
Consulting students on policy changes shouldn't be an afterthought
A fter a rocky introduction to new football seating policies, Michi-
gan's student fans have another change coming. On Tuesday,
Hunter Lochmann, the University Athletic Department's chief
marketing officer, announced a major change to the men's basketball
season ticket policy in which students now have to claim tickets to indi-
vidual games. This change is effective immediately, yet it comes months
after students purchased season ticket packages. Nearly 4,500 students
purchased ticket packages, but 3,000 seats are available to students each
game. While this policy does makes sense, and may be the best option
given the situation, it comes at an odd time since students already pur-
chased tickets.

I

Lochmann argues that the main problem
at basketball games is student attendance,
saying that an average of 46.1 percent of
student tickets were used per game in 2012-
2013. In comments to The Michigan Daily
Tuesday, Lochmann said, "We don't want
to play a guessing game of who's coming."
While student turnout is obviously impor-
tant, the problem lies in the fact that poten-
tially 1,500 students will not have seats at
basketball games for tickets they thought
were guaranteed as part of their ticket pack-
age. The Athletic Department should admit
fault here; they oversold tickets and there-
fore it's not possible for every student who
bought a ticket to attend every game. If stu-
dent morale was the real issue, then they,
should have considered a policy change after
this season ended.
Most importantly, students should have
been more involved in the decision-making
process. The president and vice president of

the Central Student Government, Michael
Proppe and Bobby Dishell respectively, were
informed prior to the decision's announce-
ment, and the president of Maize Rage, Sasha
Shaffer, met with Lochmann and two other
department officials during the decision-
making process. Though Shaffer and CSG
leaders do represent the student body, there
were other outlets available for the Athletic
Department to gauge reaction better through
forums or surveys.
The change to basketball season tickets is
not inherently problematic. A similar ticket
scheme has been implemented at schools
like Indiana University, and given the short
amount of time before the season begins, it
may be the most effective. What is a problem,
however, is that it's part of a trend by the
Athletic Department to make policy changes
that affect a substantial percentage of the
student body without consulting more than
a handful of students.

Get unplugged

What's the first thing you do in the morn-
ing and the last thing you do before going
to bed? For most people, it's checking their
phone - e-mail, messages and other noti-
fications - to either get caught up right
before falling asleep or to see what they
missed overnight.
Whether you're waiting in line at the gro-
cery store, ridingthe bus, studying at the Shap-
iro Undergraduate Library or sittingin lecture,
take a look around you. A good number of peo-
ple are on their phone - updating a Facebook
status, tweeting, posting on Instagram.
I had no idea how much time we spend
on our phones until I was overseas over the
summer and didn't have a cell phone. I felt
like I had so much free time with a phone
not constantly buzzing every few minutes.
Sometimes on public transportation, I'd
look around and everyone around me would
have headphones on and be on their phone
or tablet in their own world. Never before
did I feel more alone in a room full of people.
But if I had my phone, I would've been doing
the same thing and would have been just as
guilty of not interacting with those around
me. As we grow closer to those farther away
from us, we are growing increasingly dis-
connected from those physically close to us.
Is it possible to be over-connected? Espe-
cially with the ever-increasing forms of
social media, there's a need to establish and
maintain a social presence. Let's be honest,
everyone loves a notification - it makes us
feel important. Heard. It lets us know that
someone cares about what we have to say
or what we are doing - something that we

innately crave as human beings.
Humans are social creatures, and, in a
globalized world, this is how we stay con-
nected. But when was the last time you
talked to the person sitting next to you in
a large lecture hall? We're so connected
with what we already know that we never
really have to step out of our comfort zone
and meet new people. In the era of Internet
and smartphones, we are truly hooked to
our gadgets.
Of course, one can argue that social media
and technology bring light to issues that you
might not know about otherwise, but what
do most people do with that information?
We either tweet about it, post a status or
share that article. That's where it ends for
most people. But what if we actually did
something about it?
Everything should be enjoyed in mod-
eration, and that includes smartphones and
social media. A few weeks ago I deleted a lot
of apps from my phone, and honestly, life
was perfectly fine. I had more time to spend
with my family, my friends and really do
something memorable with my time.
So spend a little less time on your phone
scrolling through your newsfeed for the
hundredth time. Talk to the people around
you, do something outdoors or spend your
Saturday afternoon volunteering. Or maybe
actually work on one of those DIY projects
you're always re-pinning. Take some time
away from a screen. You'll be surprised with
how much there is around you.

president of Dartmouth University and former University provost, at his inauguration.

and one 10 years older than
I am. Having all been born
between 1980
and 1995, by
definition we're
all millennials.
Yet undeniably,
we were raised
in very different
times. My broth-
ers grew up
watching movies SARA
from a VCR, lis- MOROSI
tening to music
from a Walkman
and using a landline, dial-up Inter-
net and AOL instant messenger. But
during my childhood, those were
replaced with DVDs, an iPod, cell
phones, Wi-Fi, texting, MySpace
and Facebook.
Advancements in technology
have created a void in digital com-
munication between the early and
late millennials - a distinction
that's unquestionably present but
ignored by commentators. Mybroth-
ers - Millennials 1.0 - have one
foot in both worlds, and are a bridge
between the millennial generation
and its precursor, Generation X.
The media routinely criticizes
millennials on our performance in
the workforce and our purchasing
behavior, not to mention our self-
centered nature and resistance to
authority. This is unjustified for two
reasons. First, there are two popula-
tionsofourgenerationand commen-
tators are slamming us for things we
haven't yet had a chance to respond
to. And second, they're criticizing
our generation's response to prob-
lems that their generation created.
A popular critique of millennials is
that they're noncommittal, particu-
larly in the workforce. According to
Forbes, millennials change jobs at an

average rate of once every 4.4 years.
Whilethis maybe true of the early
segment of the generation, the criti-
cism is misplaced givennthe economic
upheaval of the past few years. No
one knows how the latter half of the
generation is going to respond to the
job market, so to criticize the millen-
nials that are now graduating from
college is blatantly unfair.
Another critique is that in spite
of their engagement with consumer
culture, millennials are reluctant
to make conventional purchases -
namelyhousesand cars. Butthathes-
itance is understandable given the
economic experience of the last few
years. In fact, the reluctance on the
part of manyto buy a house, in retro-
spect, was extremely fortunate given
that many people who purchased
homes recently are now seriously
underwater in

to work out.
These sweeping generalizations
that originated from the early part
of the generation are being projected
onto a cohort that deserves distinc-
tion. While time may show that pre-
viously established notions hold true,
giving the latter portion of the gen-
eration time to forge its own identity
is the only way to know.
The same trend can be seen across
generations. Take the Baby Boomer
generation. The experiences of those
in the latter half of the generation
- greatly influenced by the hippie
culture - differ greatly fromthe con-
servative atmosphere of the 1950s
and early 60s.
The attempt to pigeonhole a gen-

had the chance of winning first,
second and third place for the
grand prize, the 19 other prizes
were more specific, including
ones for application that best
used Facebook in its design, the
best health-care application, and
the "best hack that helps people
recover from the unexpected."

GreenCan, a trashcan that
sorts recyclables and non-recy-
clables based on the sound the
item makes when entering the
receptacle, won first place, for a
prize of $6,000 and two vacation
packages.
"There was a lot more free
stuff; like, I got 15 t-shirts at Pen-
nApps," Lui said.
MHacks, as is the tradition
in student hackathons, was free
for all students to attend and
was funded by sponsors includ-
ing Facebook and Twitter, along
with startups and venture capi-

talists.
While last year's MHacks was
held in February, organizers felt
that greater demand for a hack-
athon existed in the fall. Busi-
ness junior Anuj Abrol, director
of fundraising for MHacks, said
conducting it earlier in the school
year coordinated better with stu-
dents' academic schedules and
allowed "more talent" to be dis-
covered.
Three employees from elec-
tronic-money startup Venmo,
one of the event's many spon-
sors, burnt the midnight oil along

with the hackers to mentor and
answer questions.
While certain sponsors sup-
ported MHacks in monetary
capacity, smaller companies such
as Venmo served to encourage a
culture of software development
among students and recruit for
internships and jobs.
"(The hackathon) is a great
way to give back to the com-
munity," Peter Zakin, a product
engineer atVenmo, said. "We just
graduated, too, and we want peo-
ple to know that Venmo's a great
place to work."

WALLENBERG
From Page 1A
The fellowship was estab-
lished in 2012 on the centennial
of University alum Raoul Wal-
lenberg's birth. Wallenberg has
been recognized for his role in
World War II, where he helped
coordinate the rescue of tens of
thousands of Jews in Budapest.
"Having had some time to
reflect and learn more about who
and what Raoul Wallenberg was
- a man who reveled in experi-
encing and understanding the

'other,' and demonstrated that
the capacity for great good lies
within compassion, tenacity,
and a willingness to engage in
outside-of-the-box though and
action - I have come to see the
award as a challenge to live my
life in the service of others, and
an opportunity to pursue experi-
ences that will aid in this effort,
whether now or in the future,"
Petroni said.
Whether he is searching for
illicit logging and hunting activi-
ties in the Arabuko-Sokoke For-
est, interacting with members of
local communities to learn more
about their histories or listen-

ing to local activists tell stories
in public forums, Petroni keeps
busy, often working from 6 a.m.
to 11 p.m.
Recently, the University's
Board of Regents discussed
sending more students to Africa
in various programs. However,
Rackham assistant dean John
Godfrey said the fellowship has
no intentions to focus on the spe-
cifically on Africa.
Godfrey said the fellowship is
unique in that it offers students
unprecedented freedom in using
the large grant.
"This isn't necessarily a
research experience," Godfrey

said. "The intention here is to
inspire and motivate students
to think creatively about where
they would really like to go with
this extraordinary opportu-
nity."
He said the University is inter-
ested in expanding the fellow-
ship to more than one student in
the future, pending additional
funds.
Early October, information
about applying for the fellowship
will be distributed to individual
colleges throughout the Univer-
sity, and the next winner will be
announced at the Honors Convo-
cation in mid-March.


URBAN
From Page 1A

for cars, but for people?"'
Urban Planning prof. Scott
Campbell said the temporary
transformation helped start
CROSSWALK
From Page 1A
wording requires drivers to stop
or slow for any pedestrian on a
crosswalk, while Ann Arbor's
ordinance requires yielding to
any pedestrian at the edge of a
crosswalk or on a curb.
However, both citizens and
elected officials have taken issue
with the poor wording of the cur-
rent ordinance and its variance
from the state standard. The cur-
rent ordinance even contradicts
many instructions on street signs
throughout the city.
Councilmember Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) said oftentimes when
a city has a varying ordinance
from the state-standard code,
it's just "asking for trouble." She
added that the current wording
gives too much power to pedes-
trians and often requires abrupt
stops by drivers trying to comply
with the code.
Councilmember Sumi Kai-
lasapathy (D-Ward 1) echoed

discussion about how to best
optimize limited urban space.
He characterized development
of the temporary parklet as a
"peaceful, quietly subversive
and visual activity without
being in-your-face aggressive."
"If some motorists pass-
ing by, searching for a parking
space, get frustrated that an

otherwise good parking space
has somehow been taken out
of circulation for a seemingly
frivolous, 'non-essential use,'
then hopefully that triggers
a discussion about what is an
essential use of urban space,"
Campbell said.
Cooper said the park attract-
ed at least 30 people by lunch-

time, and others continued to
trickle in throughout the day for
a total turnout of at least 70.
Joseph Cohoon, an employee
nearby Amer's Deli, said he was
happy to see State Street turn
green.
"I think it's cool that they're
relcaiming and bringing nature
back into the town."

After struggling to
afford autopsies,
officials collaborate
FALFURRIAS, Texas (AP)
- By the time the woman per-
ished, she had probably slogged
25 miles through dry ranch lands
in her quest to enter the United
States. She was found just feet
from a highway where she might
have been picked up and taken
to Houston with other migrants
making the same journey.
Not long ago, her body would
have been taken to a funeral home
for a cursory attempt at identifica-
tion, then buried in this town an
hour north of the Mexico border
under a sign reading "unknown
female."
Her death, probably from
hyperthermia, is part of a mount-
ing body count that has over-
whelmed sparsely populated
Brooks County, providing further
evidence that immigrants are
shifting their migration routes
away from the well-worn paths
into Arizona and instead cross-
ing into deep southern Texas.
The changing patterns have put
an extra burden on local govern-
ments with limited experience
in such matters and even fewer
financial resources.
"There are some counties that
have the economic wherewithal to
take on these issues, and there are
other counties that just don't have
any money, so that puts them into
a real bad bind," said Raquel Rubio
Goldsmith, coordinator of the
Binational Migration Institute at
the University of Arizona, which
researches immigration issues.
But Brooks County is trying
to step up to the challenge. Now,
all newly recovered bodies and
skeletal remains of suspected
immigrants will travel 90 miles
to nearby Webb County for autop-
sies, DNA sampling and more
intense efforts at identification.
It's a monumental step for
Brooks County, population just
over 7,100, where on arecent morn-
ing the chief deputy mopped the
floors of the sheriff'soffice himself.
He will also be making the weekly
trips to deliver corpses tothe medi-
cal examiner in Laredo.
The county handled 129 bod-
ies last year, which Judge Raul

Ramirez, the county's top admin-
istrator, says blew a hole in the
budget. And even though he and
most other local officials see
illegal immigration as a federal
problem, federal money has not
followed.
Last year, Brooks County
trailed only Pima County, Ariz.,
in the number of immigrant bod-
ies recovered and they already
have 76 this year. Nearly a million
people live in Pima County, and
the 171 bodies found in 2012 were
consistent with annual totals dat-
ing back to 2004, according to a
report by the migration institute.
Brooks County, on the other
hand, averaged 50 to 60 dead
before last year, but Border Patrol
apprehensions in the area have
soared.
The number of immigrants
detained in South Texas' Rio
Grande Valley border sector out-
paced the historic leader, the Tuc-
son sector, by more than 30,000.
Those numbers are an imperfect
measure of the overall flow of
migrants, but most of the growth
has involved Central American
immigrants, who often take the
more direct route to the U.S.
through Texas.
Immigrants typically die in
BrooksCountytryingtocircumvent
a Border Patrol checkpoint. They're
usually dropped off with guides
south of the checkpoint and forced
to hike for two or three days to a
pickup spot north of the checkpoint.
In the past, unidentified immi-
grants were crammed into the
local cemetery without DNA sam-
ples being taken. The cemetery
didnotevenhave accurate records
for the dead. In May, Lori Baker, a
Baylor University anthropologist,
led a team to Falfurrias to exhume
unidentified immigrants' graves.
Baker identified 54 marked
graves but found 63 burials. In
some cases, the team opened a
body bag expecting to find one
person and found four other bags
of remains. Some of the remains
carried tags indicating they came
from a neighboring county.
She plans to return for more
exhumations next year, and she's
encouraged by the county's prog-
ress, noting that the short-staffed
sheriff's office is going to start
taking DNA samples from family
members who come looking for
missingloved ones.


Lumm's remarks, saying the
loosely worded city ordinance
sends the wrong message to
pedestrians, especially children.
"Telling kids, 'You guys rule
on the road,' is really treachery,"
Kailasapathy said.
Both Lumm and Kailasa-
pathy added that limited police
resources and insufficient clar-
ity in the ordinance have made
enforcement difficult.
Some roads, including Plym-
outh, are equipped with pedes-
trian-activated warning lights at
crosswalks to remind drivers to
stop for pedestrians. However,
Lumm said these lights are an
unfamiliar street signal for manyl
drivers and have caused numer-
ous minor incidents as drivers
make sudden stops on a busy road.
Lumm and Kailasapathy both
noted that having a unique cross-
walk law is particularly difficult
in a city like Ann Arbor where the
population has a high turnover
rate.
Rather than citing the word-
ing of the law as the overarching

issue, Eli Cooper, Ann Arbor's
transportation program manag-
er, said the problem lies with the
responsibility of motorists and
pedestrians to be more conscious
of each other.
Cooper said campus pedes-
trians are often "plugged in
and tuned out" - distracted by
phones and other devices - but
doubts many pedestrians actu-
ally step out directly in front
of oncoming traffic since over
the past decade crash numbers
haven't increased significantly.
He'd be surprised if changing
the wording of the law will be as
helpful as increasing education
and awareness.
"The crux of the issue is not
the words on the page, it's the
behavior in the street," Cooper
said. "I'm going to respectfully
agree to disagree that merely
reverting to some earlier formu-
lation in an ordinance is going to
automatically make everything
better."
Kathy Griswold, a former Ann
Arbor school board member,

spoke last week at the City Coun-
cil meeting in favor of eliminat-
ing Ann Arbor's ordinance and
simply complying with MUTC
code. Griswold said in an inter-
view that the current law is not
based on engineering analysis
but simply prioritizing pedestri-
ans' rights.
"Unfortunately, I think that in
Ann Arbor we're an intellectual
community and that this is just
a symptom of how Ann Arbor
frequently operates," Griswold
said. "We try to intellectualize a
problem that really is a concrete
physical problem."
Councilmember Kailasapa-
thy said she is a firm supporter
of dropping the Ann Arbor ordi-
nance in favor of the MUTC code
and Lumm said she, along with
many others on the council, is
likely leaning that way as well.
Council members will meet with
city administrators on Sept. 27 to
discuss options. Lumm said the
earliest date to expect a vote on
the issue would be about a month
from now.

Mining heiress reaches court settlement

Deal on copper
magnate's estate
reached during
jury selection
NEW YORK (AP) - A ten-
tative deal has been reached
in a New York court fight over
the will of a reclusive Montana
copper mining heiress that
would give more than $30 mil-
lion of her $300 million estate
to her distant relatives, a per-
son familiar with the case said
Saturday.
The breakthrough in the
fight over Huguette Clark's
estate comes after jury selection
started in a trial pitting nearly
two dozen of her half-siblings'
descendants against a god-
daughter, a hospital where she
spent her last 20 years, a nurse,
doctors, a lawyer and others.
An April 2005 will cut out her
distant relatives. Another will,
six weeks earlier, left them most
of her money.
The tentative settlement will
give the relatives about $34.5
million after taxes under the
deal, while her nurse would
have to turn over $5 million and
a doll collection valued at about
$1.6 million, the person told The

Associated Press. Her lawyer
would get nothing.
The person spoke to the AP
on condition of anonymity to
discuss the settlement because
it hasn't yet been made public.
News of the tentative settlement
was first reported by The New
York Times and NBCNews.com.
Several of the many lawyers
involved with the case declined
to comment or didn't immedi-
ately return calls.
Clark owned lavish prop-
erties from New York's Fifth
Avenue to the California coast
but opted to spend her final two
decades ensconced in a Manhat-
tan hospital. The childless Clark
died in 2011, at age 104.
Her father, U.S. Sen. William
A. Clark, was one of the rich-
est Americans of the late 19th
and early 20th centuries. He
served as a senator from Mon-
tana, where he initially made his
fortune from copper mines. His
business empire later grew to
include building a Western rail
line and establishing a Nevada
railroad town called Las Vegas.
The surrounding Clark County
is named for him.
Jury selection started Thurs-
day in the trial over the validity
of the April 2005 will.
"The persons and institution
named herein as beneficiaries of

my estate are the true objects of
my bounty," that will said, not-
ing that she'd had only "minimal
contacts" with her relatives over
the years.
Under terms of the deal,
Clark's chief nurse, Hadassah
Peri, would get nothing and
would have to return $5 million
and the doll collection. Clark's
lawyer Wallace Bock also would
get nothing.
Clark's mansion in California,
Bellosguardo, would become a
foundation, and the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington
would get $10 million.
Clark was briefly married
in her 20s. Her assistant has
said she didn't leave her apart-
ment for decades before she was
taken, emaciated and beset by
advanced skin cancer, to Beth
Israel Medical Center in 1991.
Doctors said she was medi-
cally ready to leave months
later. But she chose to stay, at a
cost of about $400,000 a year.
And during her years there, she
rewarded the hospital, and her
caregivers, with significant gifts
on top of their fees.
Gifts to Peri included multi-
ple Manhattan apartments and
a $1.2 million Stradivarius vio-
lin, and the nurse stood to get
$30 million in the disputed will.
Clark's primary doctor received

cash Christmas presents total-
ing $500,000, among other gifts,
plus a $100,000, bequest that
he was preparing to relinquish
before testifying at the trial,
according to court documents.
The hospital got hundreds
of thousands of dollars in
cash, a $3.5 million painting
by French pre-Impressionist
Edouard Manet and a $1 mil-
lion bequest.
Clark's accountant and her
lawyer also received sizable
cash gifts, and they stood to reap
substantial fees as executors of
her estate under the challenged
will.
Clark's relatives had said hos-
pital executives, medical pro-
fessionals and Clark's lawyer
and accountant took advantage
of their access to the heiress to
manipulate their way into her
millions of dollars.
The beneficiaries have said
Clark was simply a generous
woman who wanted to help
those who helped her.
The case drew in institutions
and officials from Santa Bar-
bara Mayor Helene Schneider,
who pressed for Bellosguardo to
become a museum, to New York
state Attorney General Eric
Schneiderman, whose office
was involved in the court fight
to protect charities' interests.

Van Gogh painting
shows human side

In new golden age of
stand-up, Esposito shines

Recent discovery in
the art world
raises questions
By MAX RADWIN
Daily Fine Arts Editor
On Sept. 16, the Van Gogh
Museum in Amsterdam unveiled
a painting recently confirmed
to be an authentic Vincent van
Gogh.
The piece - a landscape titled
Sunset at Montmajour;-(1888) -
had been purchased in 1908 by
Christian Nicolai Mustad, a Nor-
wegian collector who, after being
told that it was not an original,
kept the work in his attic for sev-
eral years.
After Mustad died in 1970, the
piece fell into the hands of an
anonymous collector, where it
was rejected from museums on
numerous occasions. Monday,
to the delight of this anonymous
owner, it was confirmed as a real
and authentic van Gogh painting.
Of course, art historical
research required time to con-
firm such things.
But that much time? Why did
it take so long for the art world
to confirm this work's authentic-
ity?
Sure, there are (very specific)
references to the painting in van

Gogh's letters to his brother,
Theo. Sure, the painting had
"180" written on it - its number
in Theo van Gogh's collection.
And sure, a truly expert art his-
torian should have been able to
distinguish between the phony
and the genuine with relative
ease. But such evidence doesn't
suffice for the art world when
the work in question doesn't live
up to its perceptions of the artist
allegedly responsible.
That is, not until scientists
matched the paints in Mont-
majour - a cobalt blue specifi-
cally, which van Gogh started
using after 1887 - with the paint
from his 1881 palette. Now all
the other evidence makes sense.
Then again, all evidence makes
sense when it's examined retro-
actively.
The art world seemingly
stalled in its acceptance of
Montmajour's authenticity,
quite possibly because, as many
art critics have concluded, it just
isn't that good.
Montmajour was painted in
1888, the same year that van
Gogh painted Bedroom in Arles,
The Night Caf6 and Sunflowers.
It was also the year he sent some
of his best self-portraits to Paul
Gauguin. This painting simply
doesn't hold a severed ear to
those works.
Van Gogh's production in

1888 was perhaps more sporadic
in quality than one would have
previously suspected. Jonathan
Jones of the Guardian put it best
in his harsh, albeit fair, analysis
of Montmajour: "... The clogged
colours and clumsy composition
show his originality struggling
to overcome influence, tradition
and nerves ... Are they really,
really sure it's not a fake? The
science is unquestionable, I sup-
pose."
It's interesting to think that
van Gogh, even when master-
ing his own masters - Delac-
roix, Daumier, Hiroshige (here,
apparently, Millet) - he still
struggled to tame his influ-
ences and produce something
born out of Western art tradi-
tions, yet equally combative to
those styles. Considering that
van Gogh completed over 900
paintings, it was bound to hap-
pen with a few of his projects.
But still, this work makes one of
the most human painters that
much more human, and that
much more mortal.
Even if Sunset at Montma-
jour is a dud, which is still very
much up for debate, art lov-
ers and collectors alike can be
happy knowing that the piece
still expands the oeuvre of one
of history's greatest and most
fascinating painters, and will
sell like one too.

I was living in the epicenter of
live comedy and loving every
second of it.
New York and Chicago still
have their comedy strongholds,
but L.A. became the real place to
be for up-and-coming and estab-
lished comics alike when Johnny
Carson moved the "The Tonight
Show" from New York out West in
the mid-1970s. It was the golden
era of standup, and the iconic
late-night talk show had become
a crucial career stepping stone for
comics. While some acts remained
in New York, most comedians
followed Carson, establishing a
tight-knit comedy community that
included Jay Leno, David Letter-
man, Robin Williams and, later,
Jerry Seinfeld.
Take a look at those guys and
you'll notice something that unites
them: They're guys. Despite all the
changes going on in the comedy
world, it's still aboy's club. But
that's starting to change, albeit
slowly. Leno and Letterman are
still kicking, but the old guard is
on its way out, and theyknowit.

"Dude, you owe me 20 bucks."
Dark 'Prisoners'
demands attention

Enrapturing film
explores human
mortality
By JAMIE BIRCOLL
Daily Arts Writer
A deer traverses the snow-cov-
ered woods and pauses momen-
tarily,unaware it's caught between
the crosshairs of
a teenage son +
and his father.
The father Prisoners
recites the
Lord's Prayer, a At Quality16
practice he has and Rave
undoubtedly Alcn
done a hundred
times, urges his
son to pull the trigger, and blood
soaks the white ground - inno-
cence, the first casualty of war.
This opening sequence of
Denis Villeneuve's "Prisoners"
oozes with the dread of war,
albeit a different kind of war, one
about to befall two families cel-
ebrating Thanksgiving together.
The two young daughters of the
families disappear post dinner
without a trace. Their respec-
tive parents - Hugh Jackman
("Les Miserables") and Maria
Bello ("Abduction"), and Ter-
rence Howard ("Iron Man") and
Viola Davis ("The Help") - begin
a frantic search across their small
Pennsylvania town.

The cops, led by Jake Gyllen-
haal's ("End of Watch") Detective
Loki, find a suspect: Alex Jones
(Paul Dano, "Ruby Sparks"), the
driver of a creepy RV that was
parked on the curb of the fami-
lies' street and subsequently
disappeared. Loki informs the
families, however, that Alex has
the IQ of a10-year-old and simply
could not have carried out this
crime - this evidence doesn't sat-
isfy Jackman's Keller Dover.
Dover issues his own brand
of justice, opting to kidnap
Jones and beat the truth out of
him. He recruits the other fam-
ily patriarch, Terrence Howard's
Franklin Birch, at first opposed
but eventually convinced all the
same.
The rest of the film explores
the limits of human morality, the
ability to weather the storm that
seems to only get worse as the
days pass. Where Keller turns to
violence and torture, Birch's wife
Nancy instead begs for answers
from the suspected kidnapper -
Davis's only real purpose in the
film is this five-minute display
of desperation, but what an emo-
tionally gripping five minutes it
is.
The film features a cast with
exceptional talent; unfortunate-
ly, it chooses to focus essentially
all of its effort on its two leads,
Gyllenhaal and Jackman. None-
theless, the two actors carry the
entire film and all of itsemotional

undertakings. Gyllenhaal brings
nuance and grit to a role that in
lesser hands would be a throw-
away. But it's Jackman, shedding
the adamantium claws, that is
the true star here, masterfully
depicting a typical American
man (he loves Bruce Springsteen
and The Star-Spangled Banner)
pushed to the edge, desperate for
answers, blinded by his rage.
Villeneuve, who directed the
Oscar-nominated foreign film
"Incendies," demonstrates a tal-
ent for creating truly suspenseful
scenes. His issue rests in his (or
perhaps the script's) decision to
have the film wear its heart (and
metaphors) on its sleeve, resulting
in roughly 30 minutes of too much
film out ofits listed 153.
The film's title refers notonlyto
the kidnapped girls, but also to all
of these men and women who are,
in one way or another, confined by
their society. When does the law,
religion, even our families become
a prison, and how far are we will-
ing to go to break out?
The closing minutes of the
film features the song "Codex"
by Radiohead, with Thom Yorke
crooning"Sleightofhand,jump off
the end;" it's a fitting, beautifully
tragic summation of all that's been
lost. "Prisoners" is a dreary, dis-
turbing film and not for the faint
of heart; it demands your atten-
tion and patience, but if you stick
with it, your faith will be much
rewarded.

"A toast to our beauty."
For a good time, just

lett Johansson ("The Avengers")
and Julianne Moore ("The Kids
Are All Right") is exactly thatkind
of movie - packed with an extra
punch of immense confidence and
talent, making it the consummate
cinematic experience.
This is the story of Jon Mar-
tello, a modern-day Don Juan,
known for his ability to effort-
lessly pick up gorgeous women
every weekend and his extreme
devotion to his "body, pad, ride,
family, church, boys, girls ... and
porn." Yet, Jon, who lives the life
every man wants, isn't satisfied.
Not content with the hottest girls
in town, Jon finds solace in online
pornography, "losing himself" in
all its wonder.
Often comparing it to real life
sex, Jon views porn as a way of
life, something as usual as going
to the gym or hanging out with
his friends. Things take a turn
for the worse when his girl-
friend, played by Johansson, lit-
erally catches him in the act and
leaves him. What follows is the

When we look back at the
week of Sept. 15, 2013, we will
forever think of it as The Week of
Britney.
Following the leak of "Work
Bitch," the lead single off of her
upcoming eighth studio album,
last Sunday, Britney's team
rushed a worldwide premiere
just hours later of the HQ version.
Love it or hate it, the song, which
some see as a combination of sub-
ject matter from the acclaimed
Blackout and the EDM-style
music fromFemmeFatale, is defi-
nitely different from anything
we've ever heard from Britney
But is it too different? That's up
for debate.
Five days after its release,
"Work Bitch" still doesn't feel
like an obvious choice for a lead
single - let alone a single at all
- with its lack of a real chorus
or pop melody. That being said,
its snappy lyrics, hot beat and
middle eight make it more than
memorable. It's a party-starting
record perfect for the clubs but
not necessarily perfect for Top-
40 radio, which is arguably the
most important quality for a Brit-
ney song. "Work Bitch" is a solid
track and will probably end up
being another big hit for Britney.
Maybe not another "I Wanna
Go," but a hit nonetheless.
On Sept. 17, Britney kept the
momentum rolling with a highly
publicized appearance on "Good
Morning America" where she

She's definitely working, bitch.
announced both the release date
of her eighth album and her two-
year residency at Planet Holly-
wood in Las Vegas.
After flying into the desert out-
side of Las Vegas on a helicopter,
Brit popped on her diva shades
and talked to a "GMA" corre-
spondent about her upcoming
album. It's scheduled release date
is Dec. 3 and her favorite track
that she's recorded so far for it is
the ballad "Perfume."
Britney's upcoming Las Vegas
residency, called "Britney Spears:
Piece Of Me," has been rumored
for quite some time now but the
details have been inconsistent
at best. She'll spend two years
at Planet Hollywood playing 50
shows a year, performing her
classics and some new material.
Following the likes of Celine Dion
and Barbara Streisand, Britney's
decision to take up residency in
Vegas is somewhat groundbreak-
ing - never before has an artist

as currently popular as Britney
committed to a stint like this.
Unusual in that Britney, like most
pop stars, tends to tour following
the release of her albums; "Brit-
ney Spears: Piece Of Me" will
presumably keep her from doing
so.
Obviously fans have 100
chances to make it out to Vegas
if they want to see her live, but
it's unfortunate that Britney's
team didn't block out a chunk of
time for her to tour the rest of the
country. Regardless, if it follows
in the footsteps of her previous
tours, "Piece Of Me" is sure to
provide fans with the ultimate
Britney experience. After all, Las
Vegas was the crazy Brit of '05
and '06's stomping grounds and
every true fan has to experience
the City of Sin, don't they?

FILM REVIEW
'S alinger' sputtersI

Documentary
gets too close with
meandering pace
By MAYANK MATHUR
Daily Arts Writer
History isfilled with people and
events that have forced society to
look at itself in a mirror and ques-
tion the reflec-
tion that stares C+
back, thereby
setting the Salinger
precedent for Atthe
a cultural and
social awaken- Michigan
ing. Things sim- Weinstein
ply change, and
the bigger the
event, the longer its repercussions
will echo in our memory. It's truly
a testament to "The Catcher in the
Rye" and its author, J.D. Salinger
in that both book and author con-
tinue to be a topic for major discus-
sion even today, 62 years after its
release.
Writer-director Shane Salerno's
("Savages") latest offering, "Salin-
ger" is a documentary that stirs
the pot and provides yet another
platform for the discussion of the
celebrated book and its contro-
versial creator. Clocking in at a
running time of 120 minutes, the
documentary can be divided into
three parts.
The first focuses on Salinger's
early adulthood, the second on the
events leading up to the release
of "The Catcher in the Rye" and

third on the aftermath of the
book's release. The structure is
such that it allows the viewer to
track Salinger's personal and pro-
fessional journey, giving the audi-
ence insight into what shaped him
into the person he became during
and after the release of "Catcher."
However, the effectiveness of this
simple technique is wasted due to
poor editing and a shoddy screen-
play.
The beginning of the film is
particularly drawn out, and while
one can appreciate the need for the
filmmakers to build asolid founda-
tion for the rest of the film - and
more importantly, Salinger's char-
acter - the poor pacing removes
any sense of appreciation whatso-
ever. Certain events are needlessly
emphasized and often repeated.
For example, the fact that writ-
ing for The New Yorker was an
important thing for Salinger is
mentioned endlessly. The film cuts
from scene to scene without really
going anywhere, and the audience
is left with too many perspectives
of Salinger's childhood and early
career. The interview excerpts act
as unwelcome speed breakers, and
while they might be important,
there are too many.
Things do get better as the
content finally moves on and pace
picks up, and viewers will come
out with a balanced idea of what
Salinger was like. The crucial
aspect of a documentary about a
controversial cultural icon is that
it should leave viewers with a per-
fectly realistic interpretation of
the person being discussed. This

documentary depicts Salinger as
a flawed genius, without unfairly
tipping the scales in favor of his
flaws or genius. It doesn't shy away
from pointing out that like every-
one else, Salinger had his oddities
and personal problems and the
glare the media and public fascina-
tion can have on "celebrities."
The final act is the most explo-
sive of the three. However, not
enough time is left for the coupe
de grace, and if it wasn't for the
overdrawn first section and
clumsy transition into the third,
this documentary could have
been more complete. The inter-
views are a continuing problem
throughout, simply because by
the end of it, youbegin to feel like
you know a little too much about
J.D. Salinger. It becomes all the
more disconcerting when you
think about the effort that this
man undertook in creating a wall
between himself and the world.
It's a confusing feeling
because, while the documen-
tary spends so much time treat-
ing Salinger like the Loch Ness
Monster, it treats the most per-
sonal details of his life as pub-
lic property. The film closes on
a particularly poor note with
extreme close up paparazzi
shots of a 90-year-old Salinger
walking towards his car. It leaves
the viewer wondering that had
Salinger seen this documentary
himself, would he have consid-
ered it a fitting representation of
his life? Or would he have con-
sidered it another unnecessary
intrusion into his life?

EAST HARTFORD, Conn. -
For a long 23 minutes and 17 sec-
onds of game time, the Michigan
sideline had fallen surprisingly
tense for the second week in a
row. By the end of the first half,
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
crossed his arms and looked agi-
tated. Devin Gardner lifted his
helmet atop his head, his chin-
strap obscuring a grimace as
he trotted to the sideline after
another turnover. Michigan
would trail at the half to winless
Connecticut, which had lost ear-
lier this season to FCS Towson.
The Wolverines had come
within yards of being upset by
lowly Akron the week before,
and players and coaches said
they had practiced with extra

intensity this week. But by the
third quarter, Michigan athletic
director Dave Brandon puffed
his cheeks on the sideline and
looked upward, his face show-
ing concern. UConn took the lead
into the fourth quarter.
For 23 minutes and 17 seconds,
the Huskies outplayed Michi-
gan and held the lead, which at
one point extended to 14 points.
Late heroics by junior linebacker
Desmond Morgan, who made a
one-handed interception in the
fourth quarter, allowed Michi-
gan to tie. A field goal by fifth-
year senior Brendan Gibbons
with 4:36 remaining won the
game, 24-21. But for the second
week in a row, Michigan just
barely escaped from ateam at the
bottom of the FBS food chain.
"We'd rather not let it come to
that," said Gardner, the redshirt

junior quarterback. "But if that
what it takes on this day, we're
happy with the win."
The close win over Akron was
a reality check. But Saturday's
performance may have been
closer to reality. UConn exposed
major holes in this team as it
heads into a bye week and Big
Ten play: an offensive line that
has hemorrhaged rushers and
can't control the line of scrim-
mage; a quarterback that leads
the nation in turnovers by a sig-
nificant margin; and a defense
that can be beaten over the top.
"We all are trying to figure out
where we're at as a team," Hoke
said.
Michigan's offense looked lost
against the Huskies, and UConn
wasn't just winless entering the
game. The Huskies lost by double

game's final minute.
Then linebacker Desmond

Morgan can't quite cradle a
Connecticut pass into triple
coverage Saturday night. The
15th-ranked Wolverines don't
get a short field to work with,
allowingthem to tie the game
and eventually win it with a
field goal, 24-21.
Suddenly, 4-0 is 2-2, with
losses to 37- and 18-point
underdogs.
Two improbable defensive
highlights - a fourth-down,
all-out blitz that ended with
junior linebacker Brennen
Beyer hitting Akron quarter-
back Kyle Pohl and Morgan's
Charles Woodson-esque inter-

ception - were needed to keep
Michigan from the ranks of
mediocrity. The perfect record
is still intact. Coach Brady
Hoke has repeatedly said that
goal No. 1each week is, obvi-
ously, to win, and as long as his
team does that, not all is lost.
But style points do matter,
especially for a team that is
struggling to find its confi-
dence agonst opponents that
it should be handling easily. If
the Wolverines had delivered
the blowout that nearly every-
body expected against Akron,
they would have had no reason

Maybe we Icarus'd, got too close
to the lights, where we got blind-
ed by the spectacle of the Notre

Half of Michigan's games this

expectations of this season to be
tapered, at least for now and at
least until this team improves on
what it's needed to improve on
since Week 1.
Last week against Akron
could have been an aberration,
an escape against a bad team.
Those games happen to even the
best programs.
Saturday, though was not an
aberration.
Saturday was a bad game
against a bad team, the second
game ina row where the Wolver-
ines had to claw back against a
team they should have beaten by
three touchdowns.
Saturday was a week after
fifth-year senior offensive tackle
Taylor Lewan said, "It was truly
embarrassing for Michigan
that we came out like that. We
will not come out here like this
again."
And yet, they did. The Huskies

escape against a team that lost to
an FCS opponent earlier in the
season.
Before the season, Michi-
gan had three main problems
to address: the inexperienced
offensive line, the decision mak-
ing of redshirt junior quarter-
back Devin Gardner and the play
of the secondary against deep
balls.
And after Saturday, what's
changed?

anything resembling a push in

the first half while Gardner was
sacked three times. A shakeup
on the interior line was needed
after Notre Dame, and with a bye
week coming, it will almost cer-
tainly happen now.
And most of all, Gardner
looked like the same old Gardner
- too athletic for his own good
with a mind-numbing disregard
for keeping care of the ball.
Smart reads were finished by
carelessness. On a fourth-down
play late in the game, Gardner
muscled his way for a first down
but left the ball open. He recov-
ered his own fumble, but it was
behind the first-down marker.
He finished the game with
two interceptions, his fourth and

fifth in the last two games. Gard-
ner leads the country in turn-
overs by a wide margin, despite
the fact that Michigan has been
favored to win by more than two
touchdowns in three of the four
games it's played this season.
This isn't Ohio State, Nebraska
or Penn State - these are teams
that were supposed to help Gard-
ner get his footing in his first full
year as the starting quarterback.
"There's a lot of learning
going on, to be honest with you,"
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
said. "There's alot we put on
his shoulders. I think he keeps
learning every time he goes out."
Instead, Michigan goes limp-
ing into the bye week, unde-

feated in principle but with more
problems than ever before.
After the game, Hoke said
that he wouldn't have expected
Michigan to be 4-0 with as many
turnovers as they've had. He
didn't use Gardner's name, but
the message was pretty clear
anyway.
"The first interception was
tipped, and any time that hap-
pens I have a hard time putting
that right on the guy who threw
the football," Hoke said. "We
just have to keep working and
be conscious of how we are han-
dling situations at times. Throw-
ing the ball out of bounds is
pretty good, the offense gets the
ball back or gets to punt. We've

just got to keep running home
that message."
Substitute the word "we" out
with the word "Gardner." Make
more sense? It's not Michigan
that has to be conscious of how
they are handling the ball - it's
Gardner.
Expectations might have been
too high, but they aren't now.
They are resting comfortably on
the runway, underneath Gard-
ner's giveaways and Lewan's
empty promises, 30,000 feet
below where we were blinded by
the lights.

MVP
By SIMON KAUFMAN
DailySports Writer
With the Michigan volley-
ball team trailing Ohio, 10-9, in
the third set Saturday, senior
middle blocker Jennifer Cross
leaped, cocked back her arm
and sent the ball to the ground
to spring the Wolverines to an
11-2 run. They went on to win
the set and match.
Michigan held on to win in
five sets, giving it the tourna-
ment title from this weekend's
Michigan Invitational that also
featured games against Mar-
shall and Maryland. But it was
No. 24 Ohio that gave No. 10
Michigan its biggest scare, even
after Cross ensured it was noth-
ing more than that.
She dominated all week-
end, tallying 41 total kills, 18 of
which came against the Bob-
cats. Cross also put up a .457
hitting percentage in the tour-
nament's final contest - stats
earned her weekend's most
valuable player award.
"She had a big-time week-
end," said Michigan coach
Mark Rosen. "She was phenom-
enal and you expect that from
your seniors - a senior who has
been here for four years, who
has played at a high level like
Jennifer has."
Cross played defense, too.
She had seven blocks Saturday,
giving her 18 total blocks on
the weekend. In the first set,
the senior kept the serve on the
Wolverines' side with a block
assist before securing the set
win with a kill that found the
open court.
Cross said there was an
emphasis on blocking in prac-
tice last week, and that Rosen
stressed paying attention to the
little things, such as position-

awar
ing, which paid off in the match.
Michigan (10-1) dropped
the second set, but Cross came
out fierce in the third. She had
five kills, dominating the net
area and making blocks at key
moments. Cross also had a solo
block to give the Wolverines an
8-7 lead and a block assist to
close out the game.
In the fourth set, Cross came
up big again with a kill to put
Michigan within one, trail-
ing 20-19, and then had a huge
block to tie the game at 22. But
Ohio (10-2) won the next three
points to steal the set, sending
the match to a fifth set.
In the final set, Ohio's
defense caught on and blocked
Cross on the outside on her first
two kill attempts, but Cross
adjusted, softening her touch
on her next chance to drop the
ball into open space over two
Bobcats at the net who were
anticipating a kill.
"You always have to make
changes as a hitter to make
sure the defense doesn't get a
good read on you," Cross said.
"So that's just something I
always try to do to throw off
the defender, make them come
up and then hit deep - kind of a
cat -and-mouse game."
The ploy worked and kept
Ohio off balance, allowing
Cross to get another kill to put
the Wolverines up 12-9 before
Cross clinched the match win
five points later with a power-
ful kill.
"She was ridiculous this
weekend," Rosen said. "Her
offense was absolutely ridicu-
lous, but so was her blocking.
She really had one of the best
weekends I've ever seen her
have, and I'm excited about the
rest of the season with her play-
ing like that."

JAMES cOLLER/Daily
Senior middle blocker Jennifer Cross totaled 41 kills over the weekend.

fifth set.
"That's why we play five sets,
not one," Rosen said of the game's
back-and-forth nature. "That's
just good volleyball. We're going
to get alot of that."
Freshman middle blocker
Abby Cole, an early season stand-
out, recorded three kills in the
fifth set to make up for a slow
start to the game.
"That's a kid who has been
in college volleyball for three
or four weeks," Rosen said. "I
thought she did a really good job

tonight."
Having blown two late set
opportunities to end the match
early, Michigan started the fifth
set ferociously, led by the efforts
of Cole and Goode, whose quick-
thinking flip over the net and
into open space gave the Wol-
verines a 6-5 lead that they never
relinquished. Eventually, kills
from senior setter Dannemi-
ller and Cross sealed the victory
and sent the enthusiastic Cliff
Keen Arena crowd of 1,027 home
happy.

Senior forward Nkem Ezurike scored the 35th goal of her Michigan career with a strike in the 22nd minute Sunday against Iowa. Ezurike is now four short of the Michigan all-time scoring record.
Ezurike leads 'M' to first Big Ten win

By FREDDY KASTEN
For The Daily
In what was a defensive, back-
and-forth battle, the Michigan
women's soccer team opened
up Big Ten play with a stout 2-1
win over
previously MICHIGAN 2
undefeated IOWA 1
Iowa.
Senior forward Nkem Ezurike
opened up the scoring for the
Wolverines on their first shot of
the game in the 22nd minute.
After creating her own space,
Ezurike was able to strike home
her sixth goal of the season into
the right corner of the net. The
goal - Ezurike's 35th of her career
- leaves her just four short of
becoming Michigan's all-time

scoring leader.
While noteworthy, Ezurike
isn't letting it get to her head.
"I don't think about it that
much at all," Ezurike said. "If I get
goals, I get goals. We just kind of
play, and no one really mentions
it to me."
The story of the game was the
Wolverines' aggressive and active
defense, often stacking up play-
ers in the box and containing the
Hawkeye offense to the outside.
One of the keys for Michigan
coming in was to contain Iowa's
leading goal scorer, midfielder
Chloe Lacosse.
"We basically tried to keep one
player putting pressure on her,
and then another player on each
side of that player to pick her up
if she were to get beaten because

she's so good on the dribble," said
Michigan coach Greg Ryan.
In the 56th minute, senior
midfielder Meghan Toohey used
her speed to make a nice play to
get the ball into the box to senior
forward Shelby Chambers-Garcia
who hit the post. Ezurike followed
up the play and looked poised to
put the Wolverines ahead but was
pushed down from behind by an
Iowa defender and unable to get
a shot off.
Michigan (1-0 Big Ten,7-lover-
all) let itself get a little down after
that no-call, and it proved costly.
Just two minutes later, Iowa (0-1,
6-1) evened up the score with a
weak goal from Bri Toelle in the
58th minute. It was the second
goal of her freshman campaign on
a cross that freshman goalkeeper

Taylor Bucklin misplayed from
the left side of the box.
However, the Wolverines
didn't let themselves get down
again after that rare defensive
mishap.
A mere two minutes after the
Hawkeye goal, senior midfielder
Kayla Mannino scored her first
goal of the season on a beauti-
ful chip from the left side of the
goal off a creative header from
Ezurike.
"At that point we were tied, so
the whole team's mentality was to
score," Mannino said. "Nkem had
a great flick on it, and I just hap-
pened to be there and finished it."
Before Mannino's goal, Ryan
switched from playing a 4-2-3-1
formation to a more offensive 3-5-
2. This alteration instantly proved

to be an effective one as Mannino
scored in the 70th minute. The
team then switched again to a
more defensive formation, a5-3-2,
which kept Iowa in check for the
rest of the game.
For the final 20 minutes the
Hawkeyes fought back hard, but
Michigan's back line once again
showed its experience, forcing
Iowa to settle for unsuccessful
corner kicks.
Bucklin bounced back nicely
after her mistake that almost cost
the Wolverines their win, record-
ing one of her two saves soon after
in the 59th minute.
Michigan's next contest is at
home against Wisconsin on Fri-
day as the team looks to improve
on its already impressive start to
Big Ten play.

Rain, rain, go away. There's a

Over the weekend, the Michi-

its fall season by returning to the
Mercedes-Benz Amateur Cham-

the first time in seven years. The
tournament - which was sched-

- was soon reduced to a 36-hole
event after heavy rains canceled

for five starting golfers from each
program. In Dowling's first event,
she selected two experienced
seniors in Yugene Lee and Alyssa
Shimel, as well as junior Lauren
Grogan, sophomore Catherine
Peters and freshman Grace Choi.
The tournament marked Choi's
collegiate debut.
"It was a pretty special event
for the whole team because it
was my first event and our assis-
tant coach's first event with the
group," Dowling said. "But we
implemented a lot of tactics as
far as the practice round goes,

implemented the changes the best
I could have imagined."

came from Gardner. On Michi-
gan's first drive of the second
half, he fumbled on a quarter-
back sneak. UConn's Ty-Meer
Brown scooped it and scored to
put the Huskies ahead 21-7. He
also threw two interceptions.
Gardner has now had a turnover
returned for a touchdown in
three straight games.
Gardner finished 11-of-23 for
97 yards and zero touchdowns
passing. He also rushed for 64
yards on the ground (he lost 24
yards on sacks) with one touch-
down.

going on," Hoke said, referring
to Gardner. "And there's a lot

selves sitting in nth placeafter
the first 18 holes on Friday, right
in the middle of the pack with 296
strokes, 12 over par, but still 17
strokes behind first-place South
Carolina. The scoring for the
championship counts the four
best golfers from each team.
The second day was canceled
because thunderstorms hit the
Knoxville area earlier that morn-
ing, and the grass was too wet for
action.
"I think the team could've used
the experience and the competi-
tion but, you know, you can't con-

Earlier in the second quarter,
UConn took a 14-7 lead after a
punt hit freshman wide receiver
Da'Mario Jones deep in Michi-
gan's own territory. UConn
needed just two plays to convert
the touchdown.
Michigan's defense and the
play of fifth-year senior running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint kept
the Wolverines in the game.
With about 10 minutes remain-
ing in the game and Michigan
trailing by a touchdown, Mor-
gan made his leaping one-hand-
ed interception and returned it
to UConn's 12-yard line.

3-over-par 571, respectively. The
next best team, Tulane, finished
10 strokes behind the leaders with
an 11-over-par 579.
Michigan shot 21 over par for a
total of 593 strokes to finish tied
for ninth with Mississippi State.
Grogan led the Wolverines in
scoring with a low of a 4-over-par
147, a score including five birdies.
Next was Peters at six over par,

Toussaint scored on the next
play to tie the game. Toussaint
had his best game of the sea-
son, rushing for 120 yards in 24
attempts with two touchdowns,
both while Michigan trailed in
the second half.
But Michigan's offense again
failed to establish the line of
scrimmage. Hoke said the line
improved late but still didn't
generate enough push. Most
inside runs were doomed before
Toussaint hit the hole.
And again, Michigan's offense
had to rely on Gardner's legs.
Michigan turned to the quarter-

For Michigan - a team that
finished in 10th-place in the Big
Ten Tournament last year - a top
10 finish in the Mercedes-Benz
Championship can be seen as a
promisingsuccess.
"Obviously, the aspirations are
higher than that," Dowling said.
"But I have to say that there are
quite a few very strong teams, his-
torically strong SEC teams, in the
field that we beat. I learned a lot
from watching this team compete
for two days, and I can't tell you
how excited I am for the future of
this program."
Michigan opted for a Gardner
run once more on fourth-and-2,
instead of a field goal.
Michigan trailed by seven
points, and had the ball on UCo-
nn's 23-yard line.
The Huskies made the stop.
It was another embarrassing
moment for Michigan in a night
full of them. And without the
momentum-changing intercep-
tion from Morgan, it could've
been fatal.
"We're Michigan, though,"
said junior defensive end Frank
Clark. "We don't settle for less.
We don't play to anyone else's
level. And for the last two weeks
we have. But we're going to step
it up."

BYE WEEK
From Page 1B
to doubt themselves when they
played their first road game of
the season against the Huskies.
Even the narrow escape the
week before, though, wasn't
enough to keep Michigan from
looking like a shell of the team
that beat Notre Dame on Sept.
7 under the lights.
"Every opponent, we expect
to play a tough game. We're
Michigan, though," said junior
defensive end Frank Clark.
"We don't settle for less. We
don't play to anyone's level.
And for the last two weeks, we
have."
The schedule doesn't get dis-

cernibly harder for a few weeks
now, which might actually be
a bad thing if the Wolverines
continue playing down to their
opponents.
Two of the next three
games, Minnesota on Oct. 5
and Indiana on Oct. 19, are
against teams that were picked
to finish in the bottom half of
the Big Ten standings before
the season.
The other game before the
schedule becomes increasingly
difficult, Penn State on Oct.
12, will give the Wolverines a
chance to show they can win
an important conference road
game - last season, they beat
only Purdue and Minnesota
away from home.
First up, though, is the bye

week, and it couldn't possibly
come at a better time.
Unlike last week, there will
be no surprise Sunday full-pads
practice to try and get the lat-
est debacle out of the heads of
the players.
Also unlike last week, the
chance for redemption won't
come for two weeks. Redshirt
junior quarterback Devin
Gardner said midway through
the week of preparations for
Connecticut that when you
play poorly, the following Sat-
urday takes forever to arrive.
Gardner topped his abysmal
Akron performance, which
he called possibly his worst
game ever at any level, with
three more turnovers against
the Huskies. It's safe to say the

next two weeks will crawl for
him.
And it's certainly best
that they do. The reason why
Michigan so desperately needs
this early season bye week isn't
to recover physically and get
healthy, though that is a happy
side effect.
The bye is most crucial now
because this team has a bruised
psyche. Two weeks from now,
fewer teams will be among the
unbeaten, but Michigan will
still be one. Perhaps a week
without a game is exactly what
the Wolverines need to begin
playing like it.

season and the course of games."
After the first few minutes of
back-and-forth overtime play, the
Wolverines finally struck again,
92 minutes after their opening
goal. McAtee received the ball
along the line after being set up
by senior forward Malcolm Mill-
er. McAtee evaded his defender
and found open space to launch
the shot that gave Michigan the
victory. Minutes after giving up
a crushing goal, the Wolverines
dramatically captured a road win.
"A lot of teams, if they conced-
ed so late, probably would have
folded," Daley said. "But our guys
refused to let that happen to them
tonight."

FOOTBALL
Morgan, defense bail
out stagnant offense

Fifth-year senior running back Fitzgerald Toussaint had his best game of the year against Connecticut. He rushed for 120 yards on 24 carries with two touchdowns.
the end, Fitz carries offense

EAST HARTFORD, Conn. -
There's one thing that Michigan
defensive coordinator Greg Mat-
tison never wants to leave for a
road trip without. At times, it
seemed like the
Michigan foot- NOTEBOOK
ball team left
it in Ann Arbor, but luckily for
them, junior linebacker Desmond
Morgan remembered to bring it to
Connecticut.
"(Mattison) tells us every
time we go on the road you've
got to pack your defense, you've
got to pack your championship
effort," Morgan said. "He always
preaches to us we always have to
step up and hold opponents to as
little yards as we can and keep the
points off the boards."
Morgan remembering to bring
that effort can certainly be called
the turning point in the game for
Michigan. His fourth-quarter,
one-armed interception that he
returned for 29 yards compen-
sated for the Wolverines' stagnant
offense and led them to a 24-21
win over the Huskies.
Morgan said all he had to do
was read the quarterback's eyes
and he knew where the ball was
going to be. As soon as he caught
it, his high school running back
days kicked in and he set up an
easy touchdown for the Wolver-
ines.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
acknowledged that, even though
the defense didn't truly pick up
until the end of the game, it still
played "awfully hard" during the
lackluster first half.
Though Morgan's interception
was the highlight of the Wolver-
ines' performance, Hoke also
made sure to mention the pass
rush - an area of concern that
Mattison took upon himself to fix
in the week of practice leading up
to UConn.
According to junior defensive

end Frank Clark, the Wolverines
live for those fourth-quarter big
defensive plays. Clark, who bold-
ly predicted double digit sacks
for himself this season, finally
notched his first two on Saturday.
"When you get the game and
you're able to have the game put
on the defense's back that's what
we come here for," Clark said.
"We come here for those situa-
tions like this."
SPECIAL TEAM'S SPECIAL-
TIES: Between Morgan's big
moment and the absence of any
huge offensive plays, it would be
easy to overlook one of the most
consistent aspects of Michigan's
game all night: its special teams
performance.
The Wolverines reverted back
to senior wide receiver Drew
Dileo handling punt returns,
partly due to his veteran status,
and partly due to the breezy con-
ditions on the field.
"I think tonight, the (UConn
punter) in the two previous games
sprayed the ball around a little
bit," Hoke said. "To have a guy
who has that experience is always
good."
Michigan also saw more pro-
duction from junior kicker Matt
Wile. Wile struggled in the pre-
vious week, with either too many
kicks out of bounds or ones he just
shanked. On Saturday, though,
Wile averaged 42.4 yards on five
punts, prompting praise from
Hoke.
RESTING GARDNER: Hoke said
that Michiganhadno seriousinju-
ries, but that redshirt junior quar-
terback Devin Gardner would use
the upcoming bye week to recover
from a few big hits he took. In the
preseason, Gardner said it was
going to be a goal of his to run out
of bounds more frequently to try
and avoid unnecessary hits.
"I'm sure he's banged up," Hoke
said. "He took some licks and
sometimes he puts himself in that
position because he's competitive
and tries to get that extra yard."

EAST HARTFORD, Conn. -
The breakout performance of the
man once sidelined by a broken
leg came in a game where every-
thing on offense seemed to be
broken except the way he carried
the ball.
For the second week in a row,
redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner had his worst
game as a college quarterback,
and for the second week in a
row, the Michigan football team
needed fifth-year senior running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint more
than ever.
Against Akron last week,
more than SO rushing yards were
called back due to penalties. The
game ended on an incomplete
pass in the end zone that was
about 6 inches away from being
caught.
On Saturday, the game ended

with a victory formation. This
time, there was nothing to bring
Toussaint back. He scampered
for 120 yards and two touch-
downs, leading the Wolverines
to a 24-21 win over Connecticut
in his best game of the season.
It was the first time a Michigan
running back had 100 yards in
a game since he had 120 against
Ohio State in 2011.
Toussaint hasn't necessarily
struggled this season, but until
Saturday, he hadn't exactly car-
ried the offense, either.
Part ofthat was due to a young,
inexperienced offensive line. It's
hard to run through holes that
aren't there. And those problems
didn't go away on Saturday - the
line continued to struggle, espe-
cially at the point of attack in the
interior.
Still, Toussaint made it work,
particularly toward the end of
the game. With Michigan down
two touchdowns, he got a pitch

on UConn's 40-yard line from
Gardner, who was pummeled as
he released the ball. It was an
option pitch, the same one that
Gardner fumbled last week.
Gashing through the line of
scrimmage, Toussaint cut toward
the Husky sideline and ran later-
ally for seven yards before juk-
ing his way to the end zone for a
35-yard touchdown run. That got
Michigan back in the game.
"Before the play started, I
know it would have to be a quick
pitch just like last week," Gard-
ner said. "This week I responded
early and pitched it and the result
was a touchdown. It was a great
run from Fitz."
Then, in the fourth quarter,
junior linebacker Desmond Mor-
gan made the play of the game on
a one-handed interception.
His long return set up Tous-
saint, who took a handoff on the
next play and slashed diagonally
toward the end zone to tie the

game.
The offensive play-calling
had to get conservative after
another onslaught of turnovers
from Gardner, which meant that
Toussaint had a bigger role than
in past weeks. Through the first
three weeks of the season, he
was averaging 3.4 yards a carry
and hadn't crossed the 200-yard
threshold yet.
Now, he's leading the team
in rushing for the first time this
season. Gardner is undoubtedly
the team leader on offense, but if
his awful turnover pace contin-
ues, Toussaint is going to have to
be the one to pick up the slack.
The Wolverines go into the
bye week with more questions
than answers on offense. Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke said his
offense had a "major league
problem" with turnovers.
And yet, in a broken offense,
the guy who recovered from a
broken leg might be the key.
