Chinese 
students 
in 
the 
U.S. have faced a unique set of 
challenges amid the pandemic, 
several of which exceed those of 
their domestic peers: from dealing 
with hate speech that wrongfully 
places 
blame 
on 
Chinese 
immigrants for the pandemic, to 
the threat of deportation in light 
of disruptions to their in-person 
research and academic pursuits. 
For Chinese graduate students in 
STEM fields, they face additional 
concerns 
from 
the 
federal 
government.
On May 29, President Donald 
Trump 
issued 
a 
presidential 
proclamation that restricts certain 
Chinese students and researchers 
at 
the 
postgraduate 
and 
postdoctoral levels from entry to 
the U.S. on student visas, effective 
as of June 1. The proclamation 
specifies a few exceptions, such 
as 
undergraduate 
students, 
permanent residents and spouses 
of U.S. citizens and permanent 

residents.
According to the proclamation, 
these restrictions are a response 
to China’s “wide-ranging and 
heavily resourced campaign to 
acquire sensitive United States 
technologies 
and 
intellectual 
properties” 
for 
use 
by 
the 
People’s Liberation Army. The 
proclamation claims that this 
campaign constitutes a threat 
to both the U.S. economy and 
national security.
Although 
affected 
students 
and 
institutions 
— 
including 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
according to the International 
Center — await clarifications 
from the Department of State 
and Homeland Security on what 
may constitute an association 
with the PLA, some students say 
they already saw these targeted 
restrictions coming.

Chinese grad students 
face federal restrictions

Design by Hibah Chughtai

When Education graduate student 
Alyssa 
Brandon 
and 
Katherine 
Taylor, manager of communications 
and special projects at the School of 
Education, noticed the University of 
Michigan was not observing June 19 
as a holiday, they decided to send an 
open letter to University President 
Mark Schlisel asking the University 
to allow faculty members and staff 
to officially recognize Juneteenth as 
a national holiday in the workplace. 
Since its release on June 16, the open 
letter has received over 500 signatures 
and continues to gain support from 
staff, students, alumni and other 
University community members. 
“We thought this was such a timely, 
urgent request,” Brandon said. “Given 
the daily reminders of brutality and 
loss faced in the Black community 
(and) the pain that is (being) 
experiencing. This is an opportunity 
for the University to really step up 
and to offer tangible evidence of 
its commitment to — not just only 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion — but 
to its Black community members.”
The letter asks the University to 
“give all regular staff members the 
option to take paid time off (without 
having to use vacation or sick time)” 
on June 19. It also includes a long 
term request, asking the University 
to develop plans for continuing to 
acknowledge 
Juneteenth 
in 
the 
future. 
University Public Affairs did not 
respond in time for publication. 
Juneteenth, celebrated on June 19, 
is the day all slaves in Texas were freed 
in 1865, which signified the freeing 
of all slaves across the United States. 
Juneteenth is known among the Black 
community as the Black independence 
day. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has 
signed 
proclamations 
recognizing 
Juneteenth since 2019 and the holiday 
has been officially celebrated in the 
state of Michigan for 16 years. 

Quicken Loans is giving their 
employees 
a 
paid 
holiday 
and 
other companies are recognizing 
Juneteenth in different ways. Many 
events are occurring in Ann Arbor 
on Friday to celebrate Juneteenth as 
well. The holiday has gained more 
recognition 
through 
the 
recent 
protests that have supported the Black 
Lives Matter movement and stood up 
against police brutality.
According to Brandon, the School 
of Education is giving their staff early 
release to recognize the holiday, but 
she believes it is important for the 
whole University to be involved in 
celebrating Juneteenth.
“You have to think of the University 
(as not) just a research institution, but 
it’s an institution that is a member 
of a larger community that not only 
serves the Black community, but is 
served by the Black community,” 
Brandon said. “It’s also the systems of 
white supremacy and anti-Blackness 
and violence (that) impacts us just as 
they do (at) other organizations (and) 
other communities. The University 
is not immune to those patterns. It’s 
very much entrenched and impacted 
in them … This timing really presents 
a very crucial opportunity for the 
University to step up. It will be such an 
awesome opportunity to show the care 
and commitment that (the University 
has) for the Black community and the 
University community at large.”
David 
Humphrey, 
School 
of 
Education diversity and inclusion 
officer, signed the open letter, saying it 
was important for him as a Black man 
to celebrate Juneteenth. He said the 
University should be able to recognize 
the holiday for the Black community.
“I thought this was an excellent 
thing 
to 
consider,” 
Humphrey 
said. “As a Black man, this is my 
Independence Day. An opportunity 
for an institution that I love and is 
committed to thinking deeply about

Metro-Detroiters 
march against police 
brutality 

Last weekend, The Michigan 
Daily reporters went to 11 differ-
ent protests, driving 269 miles and 
speaking to almost 100 people in 
10 cities about why they came out. 
Some said it was their first time 
protesting. Many more said they 
were used to protests in big cities, 
but they never expected protests 
of this magnitude — or even pro-
tests in general — in their subur-
ban hometowns. When asked if not 
before, why now, almost everyone 
had the same answer: People are 
tired, and they want change. 
This article is the fourth install-
ment of a four-part series on police 
brutality protests across Metro 
Detroit over the weekend of June 6 
and 7. Read part one here, part two 
here, and part three here. 
Elizabeth Taylor lives in Red-
ford and has a membership with 
the Livonia Recreation Center. 
When she and her family use the 
rec center, she said multiple peo-
ple will harass them and come up 
to them asking for their IDs. Tay-
lor said she was taught not to drive 
in Livonia and not to come to Livo-
nia unless she has to.
One among thousands protest-
ing police brutality in a city that 
has been often hostile to her and 
family, Taylor said she couldn’t 
help but get emotional.
“When I first got here, I was 
moved to tears and I tried to hold 
them back,” Taylor said. “But 
just to see all of these people, the 
white people, here with us, I do 
not know anything about this. I’m 
not used to white people being on 
my side. So this is amazing to me. 
This is an experience I will never 
forget in my life.”
Over the weekend, tens of 
thousands wore masks to march 
in suburbs throughout Metro 
Detroit against police brutality, 
joining millions across the coun-
try and around the world in wave 
after wave of protests sparked by 

the killing of George Floyd.
Throughout the latter half 
of the 1900s, the growth of the 
suburbs often came at Detroit’s 
expense, as capital and white 
residents moved out of the city in 
droves while Black residents were 
prevented from following. To this 
day, Detroit is unique among other 
metropolitan hubs across the 
country in that much of the wealth 
is concentrated in its outlying sub-
urbs rather than in the city itself. 
The majority of those arrest-
ed in the first several days of 
Detroit’s protests lived in the sub-
urbs. Through the week, protests 
began spreading to Detroit’s sub-
urbs, many of which are predomi-
nantly white.
Southfield resident Monique 
Montgomery said her 12-year-old 
daughter has been upset and trau-
matized from hearing about police 
brutality in the news, as she is now 
“at the age where she gets it.” She 
said she brought her daughter to 
the Birmingham protest because 
she wanted her daughter to see 
Black and non-Black protesters 
denouncing racism together.
“I wanted her to see that not 
everybody feels that way,” Mont-
gomery said. “It’s nice to see the 
diversity, it’s nice to see that we 
have allies. I think it’s not just 
Black people that are sick of it, all 
people are sick of it. They realize 
they can’t stay silent if they want 
change. Their children are grow-
ing up in this world too.”
The Daily contacted the Livo-
nia Police Department, but they 
did not reply in time for publica-
tion.
Below are some of the protest-
ers from Sunday on their experi-
ences with racism and what this 
current moment means to them. 
2PM - Birmingham - 91.5 per-
cent white and 2.8 percent Black 
- $118k median household income
Thousands filled the streets of 
downtown Birmingham, shutting 
down a portion of Woodward Ave-
nue, walking past pretty boulevards 
and flooding nearby neighborhoods 
with chants of “Black Lives Mat-
ter.”

Academia strikes for 
Black Lives Matter 
movement

In an effort to combat systemic 
racism in the fields of academia, 
professionals in the academic and 
science, technology, engineering 
and math (STEM) communities 
across the country participated 
in 
a 
#ShutDownSTEM, 
#ShutDownAcademia 
and 
#Strike4BlackLives day on June 10.
Over 5,800 members of the 
STEM and academic community 
pledged to participate in the strike. 
The shutdown also received support 
from multiple organizations such 
as Nature and the American 
Association for the Advancement of 
Science, among others. 
Brian Nord, one of the organizers 
of the strike, is a physicist at Fermi 
National Accelerator Laboratory 
in Illinois. He wrote in a statement 
explaining how this movement 
was more than acknowledging 
marginalized groups in STEM. 
Instead, this strike is to call 
attention to the racial inequities 
Black scientists and educators face 
in the workplace and beyond.
“This is not about identifying 
with a minority or marginalized 
group or diversity and inclusion,” 
Nord wrote. “This moment is about 
Black people and the conditions 
under which we live and work. 
It is about how white supremacy 
pervades my professional spaces as 

well as my life outside of them.”
Tim McKay, professor of physics 
and astronomy and associate dean 
for undergraduate education in 
LSA, participated in the shutdown 
in hopes of initiating meaningful 
change in the STEM community. 
He said scientists must pay equal 
attention to both their innovations 
as well as the implications their 
work has on supporting racism. 
“We need to acknowledge that 
a field which is not equitable and 
inclusive cannot be excellent,” 
McKay said. “Most scientists work 
hard to become deep experts in the 
subject matter they study. We must 
also work hard to understand the 
role of science in creating race and 
supporting racism, to find out when 
and how what we do is still causing 
harm, and take action to change.” 
The day opened opportunities 
for white and non-Black people of 
color to educate themselves, take 
responsibility in creating anti-racist 
actions moving forward and develop 
safe and healing spacies for those 
affected. To McKay, that starts 
with acknowledging the inequities 
and prioritizing the dismantling of 
racism in STEM.
“Racial inequities have been 
well-documented in many areas of 
science and engineering, including 
education, hiring and employment, 
research and publication,” McKay 
said. “For too long, those of us 
working in STEM fields have 
been willing to accept external 
explanations for these inequities.

Tens of thousands 
protest in suburbs


After 
temporarily 
closing 

all 
locations 
for 
almost 
two 

months in light of the COVID-19 
pandemic, Espresso Royale Coffee 
has announced all business will 
permanently 
cease, 
including 

branch operations, catering and 
online sales. 

“Some 
would 
say 
that 
a 

company that goes out of business 
has failed; we don’t think so,” their 
website said. “Since 1987, Espresso 
Royale has served excellent coffee 
to millions of customers, has 
provided good work for thousands 
of people, and has purchased 
millions of dollars of goods and 
services from businesses around 
the country. We think that’s a 
success.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Lucianna 

Rosania said she was surprised the 
company was closing, especially 
since the coffee shop has been 
around for most of her childhood. 

“I was totally shocked when I 

found out it was closing,” Rosania 
said. “It hit a lot as an Ann Arbor 
native because I’ve been going 
there since I was 6 years old, and 
my dad is a professor at U of M so 
I have very fond memories of those 
locations.”

Besides being integral in the 

Ann Arbor community, Espresso 
Royale has also been a long-time 
campus staple. It was even voted 
Best Coffee Shop in Ann Arbor in 
2014. 

Engineering sophomore Zach 

Eichenberger 
noted 
Espresso 

Royale had a special ambiance that 
made it better than other coffee 
shops. 

“I always loved going to Espresso 

Royale,” Eichenberger said. “The 
atmosphere was really chill. It 
stood out from all the Starbucks 
and other (places) because it had 
more of a cozy atmosphere. It was 
more personal.”

Conveniently having multiple 

locations 
on 
campus, 
the 

University of Michigan community 
could often be found holding meet 
ups and doing homework while 
sipping a cup of coffee. For LSA 
sophomore Dominic Coletti, the 
Espresso Royale on South State 
Street 
and 
South 
University 

Avenue was a frequent place to 
visit both for quality coffee and a 
place to study. 

“I would always go there before 

all of my exams and just grab a 
small, hazelnut coffee because 
their hazelnut was the best out of 
anybody that I could find,” Coletti 
said. “I also lived in East Quad, so 
that was a pretty popular place to 
go and study for people that just 
needed to get out of the building 
but didn’t want to go too far, 
especially on cold, winter days.”

After the COVID-19 pandemic 

struck, classes moved online and 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s Stay 
Home, Stay Safe order took into 
effect, many local businesses set 
up GoFundMe pages to stay afloat. 
Many businesses told The Daily 
they question the future of the 
local economy and the possibility 
of 
reopening. 
Unfortunately 

as the pandemic dragged on, 
Espresso Royale noted “it became 
impossible for our company to 
remain viable.”

Eichenberger said he thinks the 

absence of the campus community 
played a large part in Espresso 
Royale’s closing and noted the 
misfortune of the loss of the coffee 
shop. 

“Their main source is probably 

college students, professors, and 
with 
everything 
going 
online 

they’re not going to have those 
people,” Eichenberger said. “I 
think the University (community) 
is losing something really special 
by losing Espresso Royale.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

Engaging, Managing, and Bond-

ing through Race is a research 
program at the University of 
Michigan involved with helping 
Black parents and children con-
front racial stress through dia-
logue. 

Alum 
Emma 
Schmidt, 
a 

program 
coordinator 
with 

EMBRace, said the goal of the 
program is to reduce parent and 
adolescent racial stress, as well as 
promote bonding for the families 
in the program.

“A lot of the work we do centers 

around racial socialization, which 
is basically talking to children 
about what their race means and 
what the social consequences 
surrounding race are,” Schmidt 
said. 

The 
EMBRace 
program 

received 
Institutional 
Review 

Board approval in winter 2020 and 
was set to launch its intervention 
program in Detroit this summer. 
But with the COVID-19 pandemic, 
EMBRace leaders postponed the 
program due to restrictions on 
working directly with Detroit 
residents.

With the delay and limited 

ability to do in-person work, 
research assistants such as Public 
Health senior Nia Watkins have 
been doing transcriptions and 
observational coding of videos 
from the EMBRace program in 
Philadelphia, as well as weekly lab 
meetings.

“The program has been done 

in other cities, most recently in 
Philadelphia,” Watkins said. “I 
know that there’s been a lot of 
positive responses there; we’re 
looking at a lot of that data.”

Watkins said her involvement 

in EMBRace gave her the ability 
to understand perspectives on 
current racial tensions from those 
outside her age group. 

“As a member of EMBRace, I’m 

thinking like how are young kids 
experiencing this, what are they 
thinking when they see this and 
how are their parents talking to 
them,” Watkins said. “I think I 
have a broader array of thought 
looking at these topics, because 
I just realized that there are 
younger kids who also have to deal 
with this and it’s not just me and 
people my own age.”

The program — which was 

founded by Dr. Riana Anderson, 
University 
researcher 
and 

assistant 
professor 
of 
health 

behavior and health education 
— is an eight session family 
program that brings Black parents 
and their children together for 

conversations about race, cultural 
pride, discrimination and stress 
management.

Schmidt said the plan for 

the program is to have families 
with children between the ages 
of 10 and 14 meet for an hour 
and a half each week to engage 
in 
conversations 
surrounding 

race. These conversations can be 
facilitated through a variety of 
techniques such as role playing, 
debating and art projects.

Schmidt 
got 
involved 
with 

EMBRace after taking PUBHLTH 
308: Black American Health: A 
Focus on Children, Families, and 
Communities with Dr. Anderson 
as an undergrad.

“(The class) was mostly based 

on racial disparities in Detroit, 
and 
structural 
barriers 
and 

structural racism,” Schmidt said. 
“It was eye-opening for me (that) 
as a white person, I could be able 
to use my privilege and power and 
education and my middle class 
status to be able to try and help 
people and try to reduce these 
barriers that so many people don’t 
even recognize.”

With the international protests 

against police brutality sparked 
by the killing of George Floyd and 
prominence of the Black Lives 
Matter movement in recent weeks, 
Schmidt said she felt EMBRace’s 
research has been emphasized.

Local college staple closes locations around the

University helps families 

handle racial stress 
through dialogue


now are nothing new. From many past 
demonstrations — including the 2014 
Ferguson protests in Missouri that ush-
ered in the Black Lives Matter move-
ment to the 1992 Los Angeles riots to 
the 1965 Watts riots — we are reminded 
that the stringent acts of racial profil-
ing, oppression and violence enacted by 
police officers on the Black community 
is a centuries-old problem. As discussed 
in a recent editorial, modern policing 
agencies in the U.S. originated from slave 
patrols and night watches, which were 
primarily constituted of white men using 
vigilante tactics to further control and 
oppress Black individuals. These groups 
worked for wealthy white slave owners 
to punish, capture and return enslaved 
people who escaped or were believed 
to have violated plantation rules. These 
first police forces were overwhelmingly 
focused on responding to, and punishing, 
what they considered disorderly, non-
white behavior rather than actual crime. 

As American slavery gratingly matured 

into a depraved regime that denied Black 
people humanity while still criminalizing 
their actions, they were considered capa-
ble of engaging in crime but “incapable of 
performing civil acts.” Similarly, while the 
13th Amendment is credited with end-
ing the concept of slavery we are taught 
in grade school, it stopped short of end-
ing slavery for those convicted of crimes. 
The laws that once governed slaves were 
replaced with Black Codes governing free 
Black individuals, soon making the new 
criminal justice system of America central 
to strategic racial control. 

These methods of oppression inten-

sified whenever Black people asserted 
their autonomy or achieved any degree 
of success. For example, during Recon-
struction, white policymakers and 
other white people in positions of power 
invented offenses used to target Black 
individuals. These included breaking 
strict curfews only for Black people, loi-
tering, vagrancy, not carrying proof of 
employment from a former slave owner, 
etc. Those caught for such actions were 
quickly apprehended and American 
slavery persisted in the form of convict 
leasing, where Southern states could 
lease their prisoners to large plantations, 
mines and railways — all for profit. 

Later, in the second half of the 20th 

century, a new political fear would emerge 
during protests over harsh inequalities 
and civil rights. Black and brown people 
are still disproportionately targeted by 
these policies that were not as explicitly 
racialized as the Black Codes, although 
their implementation has been charac-
teristically similar. Former President 
Richard Nixon’s “war on drugs,” “broken 
windows” policing, mandatory minimum 
sentences, three-strike laws, children 
tried as adults, etc., were all implemented. 
The rhetoric of “law and order” and sub-
sequent focus on suppressing the Civil 
Rights Movement was adopted as a cen-
terpiece for Nixon’s platform, which white 
authorities heavily utilized to criminalize 
Black individuals fighting for equal rights. 
As “cracking down on crime” became a 
codified tune, no distinction was drawn 

between civil rights activists, traditional 
petty crimes and rebellions. Within the 
past weeks, we’ve seen President Donald 
Trump invoke the same racist rhetoric as 
he declared himself the “president of law 
and order” and also quoted a racist 1960s 
Miami police chief by tweeting, “when 
the looting starts, the shooting starts.”

Unfortunately, many prominent poli-

ticians, including Joe Biden, former vice 
president and presumptive Democratic 
presidential nominee have not voiced 
their support for what Black communities 
across the country are calling for and are 
instead “opposed to cutting police fund-
ing and believed more spending was nec-
essary to help improve law enforcement 
and community policing.” Many activists 
advocating against reforms at this time 
are calling for politicians to “read the 
room” and to listen to the people. Howev-
er, many fear that instead of taking politi-
cal risks to implement the much needed 
systematic changes in this country, politi-
cians are more worried about alienating 
moderate white voters. 

For example, in response to an uproar 

of protests against systemic racism and 
police brutality in May 2015, former 
President Barack Obama and a selected 
team crafted “The Final Report of the 
President’s Task Force on 21st Century 
Policing.” This report consisted of vari-
ous reform approaches, many similar to 
those of the #8cantwait campaign cir-
culating recently. These reforms have 
made no permanent or effective progress 
and local activist groups are continu-
ing to reject broader pushes for more 
reform-based training. Johnetta Elzie, a 
civil rights activist and organizer, stated, 
“People in power — politicians and poli-
cymakers — are still talking about reform. 
We’re beyond that. We’re over that. If they 
wanted reform, they would have done it 
six years ago when we actually had the 
chance to. But that’s not what happened.” 

Instead, it is time to reimagine the inef-

fective and systemically racist notions of 
policing agencies and their superficial pro-
cedural reforms by defunding the police 
and investing in specific, community-
focused safety and prevention programs. 
Productive steps forward could include the 
installation of multiple community depart-
ments and facilities that interactively work 
with community residents, to an equitable 
degree. This is suggested in the #8toaboli-
tion initiative, which was initially made by 
activist group Critical Resistance and was 
then reproduced by an ad team that created 
a website providing a variety of shareable 
graphics for social media. 

In Minneapolis specifically, a report 

was published in 2018 that outlined all 
the reforms the police department has 
embraced, including body cameras and 
various training sessions that cover 
mindfulness, implicit bias and crisis inter-
vention. The Minneapolis Police Depart-
ment also forfeited money to training 
programs and better equipment, but 
there was little to no decline in Black 
fatalities caused by law enforcement.

C

onversations 
of 
defund-

ing and dismantling police 
departments have popped up 

all over the country, and many are con-
cerned about what exactly this means. 

Past attempts at reform, even in 

Minneapolis, have been evidently inef-
fective and do not satisfy community 
demands. Instead of trying to change 
things from within the system — what 
reform sought to do — it is more essen-
tial to defund and dismantle the polic-
ing system that has disproportionately 
targeted and harassed Black communi-
ties for centuries. By divesting and fun-
neling financial resources away from 
policing agencies, we can instead build 
and invest in municipal programs that 
work to fix the underlying challenges 
in communities — such as poverty, poor 
education, inadequate housing, food 
insecurity, drug rehabilitation, mental 
health problems, etc. 

There is reasonable confusion over 

the true difference between police 
reform and defunding the police, creat-
ing subsequent hesitance over the latter. 
When evaluating your own confusion, 
it’s essential to listen to the voices that 
have been most impacted by the con-
tinuous overabundance of policing and 
surveillance. Black Lives Matter co-

founder Alicia Garza stated, “When we 
talk about defunding the police, what 
we’re saying is invest in the resources 
that our communities need. So much 
of policing right now is generated and 
directed towards quality-of-life issues, 
homelessness, drug addiction, domes-
tic violence. … But what we do need 
is increased funding for housing, we 
need increased funding for education, 
we need increased funding for quality 
of life of communities who are over-
policed and over-surveilled.” 

When trying to disrupt a system that 

has been maintained through different 
mediums since slavery, we must have a 
mutual understanding of what we are 
hoping to disrupt and of what our ulti-
mate end goal should look like. Many 
activists have advocated for reforming 
the police departments; others, for a 
defunding model that would strive to 
divest large funds from national police 
departments and equitably invest 
that money into community services. 
However, we have seen, with a prime 
example being the Minneapolis Police 
Department, that reforms are not suc-
cessful. TIME reports that “the same 
reforms were recommended time and 
again over the past two decades in the 
MPD to increase accountability, curb 

use-of-force violations and build up 
community trust — with seemingly 
little implementation.” A recent move-
ment called #8cantwait advocates for 
banning unnecessary measures of vio-
lence, for requiring police officers to 
exhaust all alternatives before shooting 
and intervening and comprehensive 
reporting, among other things. Orga-
nizers claim this initiative could reduce 
police use of force by 72 percent. How-
ever, many activists are already criticiz-
ing this plan, calling it “copaganda” and 
saying it will improve policing’s war on 
the Black community, as it does not call 
for the removal of funds from police 
departments and does not address the 
entire issue of systemic racism and bru-
tality within the institution. 

Decreasing police budgets is the 

first step in addressing the dispropor-
tionate amount of funding that police 
departments receive from the federal 
government. Calls for defunding do 
not mean the removal of efforts for 
public safety, but rather a demand to 
stop spending millions of dollars on 
military-style equipment for poorly 
trained police officers. 

The protests against police brutality 

and the greater system that Americans 
are witnessing and participating in right

Divest to invest — the reality of dismantling the police
O

n Sunday, June 7, nine members of the Minneapolis City Council 
acknowledged that the current system of policing is not working and that 
they intend to “defund and dismantle” the city police department. Council 

President Lisa Bender stated, “(We need) to listen, especially to our Black leaders, 
to our communities of color, for whom policing is not working and to really let the 
solutions lie in our community.” While still in the process of planning exactly what 
these new, transformative and community-based initiatives may look like, the goal 
is to implement a model of public safety that actually keeps each community safe.

“

When do you think the protests 
will stop?” My mother asked me 
this when we were both sitting in 

the kitchen a few days ago. “Didn’t they 
arrest the cop who killed that guy? I don’t 
understand why there are all these violent 
protests still. And how does it benefit any-
one to vandalize a building?” 

My mother is the daughter of two 

Cuban immigrants. My father is the 
proud son of two Cubans who also came 
to the United States decades ago. Many 
older members of my family, including 
my grandparents, have likewise voiced 
concerns about the legitimacy of the pro-
tests erupting around the country in the 
aftermath of George Floyd’s death. One of 
my late relatives was imprisoned in Cuba 
for more than 20 years for his activities as 
a political activist. I have been wondering 
lately what he would have to say about my 
family’s response, given Cuba’s own his-
tory of protest. Likewise, political activ-
ism before and during the 90s in Cuba 
bears notable distinctions from the con-
temporary protests in the United States, 
but there are also important parallels. 

When the Soviet Union dissolved in 

1991, Cuba lost its main trading partner as 
well as the source of much of its interna-
tional political support. An economic cri-
sis soon unfolded within Cuba, resulting 
in strict rationing, rolling blackouts (for up 
to 20 hours) and severe medicine short-
ages. In 1994, nearly a thousand Cubans 
gathered at Havana’s Malecon (a sea wall 
along the country’s capital known for its 
tourist appeal) to voice their frustrations. 
Protesters broke windows and destroyed 
property as others recorded the events 
unfolding, desperate for their voices to 
be heard. The uprising was effectively 
quelled on the same day it started because 
police shot, beat or threatened protesters 
who would not leave the streets. Nobody 
really writes much about this uprising. 
But many Cubans solemnly remember it, 
even if they no longer live on the island. 
Cuban-American communities should 
bear those parallels in mind when consid-
ering their role and respective privilege 
in the broader context of police violence 
against people of color. 

Despite the destructionist tactics 

used by protestors, the Maleconazo riot 
is a point of pride for many Cubans who 
now reside in the U.S. If my own commu-
nity’s continued willingness to speak out 
against past injustice at the hands of Fidel 
Castro’s military and police force is any 
indication, many Cubans who now reside 
in the United States would not be so quick 
to condemn the Maleconazo riot more 
than 25 years ago. I struggle to imagine 
any of my grandparents criticizing those 
protestors who vandalized buildings 
in a display of their frustration against 
their country’s deteriorating economic 
conditions. No Cuban-American I know 

speaks out against those who stole boats 
that same year to flee to the United States. 
In some ways, the lack of understand-
ing that many Cubans in my community 
have exhibited towards those protesting 
police brutality and the United States’ 
long legacy of systemic racism is surpris-
ing. In many ways, however, this reaction 
is predictable.

Despite the history of anti-Latino sen-

timent in the United States, Latin Ameri-
can communities have not always been 
compassionate or responsible partners 
in the fight against racism. Even though 
people of Hispanic descent have been 
racially profiled by police or are increas-
ingly the target of hate crimes, racism has 
been deeply internalized in many immi-
grant communities. As Karla McKanders, 
a clinical professor of law at Vanderbilt 
Law School, writes, instead of seeing 
themselves as natural allies in the fight for 
social and economic justice, many white 
and white-passing Cuban-Americans 
see themselves in competition with Black 
Americans. Furthermore, George Marti-
nez, a professor of law at Southern Meth-
odist University, writes that some Latinos 
“often sought to ‘pass’ as white … because 
they thought that becoming white 
insured greater economic, political and 
social security … [which] meant gaining 
access to a whole set of public and private 
privileges, and was a way to avoid being 
the object of others’ domination.” Like 
many privileged Cuban-Americans, I per-
sonally have been guilty of implicit bias and 
racism — both intentional and not — and am 
still learning how I can most effectively dis-
mantle the subtle, yet powerful hatred that 
often exists in my own community. 

Whether these comments are intend-

ed to belittle Black activists or not, many 
of the critiques I have heard of the ongo-
ing protests are nonetheless reflections 
of that same subtle hatred. Deflecting to 
concerns about property damage belit-
tles the real and immeasurable pain that 
police brutality has inflicted upon Black 
communities. Responding to the interna-
tional outcry over the irreplaceable loss 
of lives with reports of damaged vehicles 
or stores suggests that perhaps, in fact, 
you might not think Black lives matter as 
much mass-produced, replaceable objects 
from Target. (As an aside, it is never a 
good sign when a multi-million dollar 
corporation’s response to looting is more 
charitable than your own). Dismissing 
these protests as “violent” and thus irre-
deemable avoids an important discussion 
about why protests are taking place at all 
and does not consider the larger history of 
protests across the world.

E

very morning I wake up and 
pray, Pray that my Black life 
might matter today.

Flashing lights came on behind 

our car and my lunch immedi-
ately went straight to my throat. 
My mother, who is a University 
of Michigan trained corporate 
attorney, told my sisters and I to 
quiet down as she nervously rolled 
down the window to face a white 
officer in the wealthy northern 
suburbs of Detroit. As she tried 
to explain that my father usu-
ally drove the car, he cut her off, 
“What are you doing in this neigh-
borhood?” “Officer, I live around 
the corner,” my mother explained. 
A bead of sweat appeared above 
her forehead despite the fact 
that she was telling the truth. 
The tense exchange continued, 
“Ma’am, have you been drinking?” 
If I wasn’t about to cry, I probably 
would have laughed at the ridicu-
lousness of the question. In my 20 
years on this Earth, I have only 
seen my mom drink three times 
and, certainly, none of them were 
at 4 p.m. on a Monday afternoon. 
After a few more tense minutes of 
the exchange, the officer let my 
mom go without ever explaining 
what she did wrong. As we pulled 
away, I began to cry.

Every morning I wake up and 

pray, Pray that I won’t fear for my 
safety today.

When tragedies like George 

Floyd’s death occur, the tradi-
tional response from white lib-
erals has been to go directly to 
social media, posting to remind 
everyone how woke they are 
while advocating for changes to 
the systemic disenfranchisement 
of Black people. Hashtags trend, 
protests are organized, conflict 
ensues and escalates and the con-
versation 
ultimately 
becomes 

more about the violence in these 
protests than the inequities fac-
ing the Black community, fueling 
the left’s rage. This, in turn, allows 
Fox News and other conservative 
media talking heads — who claim 
not to be explicitly racist but sim-
ply support a policeman’s right to 
kill unarmed Black people — to 
change the narrative and muddy 
the waters. Suddenly, the voices 
are so muddled that most people 
tune out, Trump or someone else 
in the Republican Party creates a 
diversion, then eventually every-
one moves on. Nothing changes.

Every morning I wake up and 

pray, Pray that I will see my bed at 
the end of the day.

With my brothers and sisters, 

I watch these movements with 
hope, believing that this time 
might be different; This time 
police might be held account-
able and real change might send 
shockwaves through the system. 
Together, we cringe when the 
president sends a tweet. Together, 
we raise our voices in solidarity 
as opposition to whoever stands 
against our movement, but we 
know that speaking up risks our 
lives. Knowing this, we speak 
louder because each word might 
be our last. Each word might force 
us to leave this world too early, like 
our brothers Trayvon and Freddie 
and our sisters Aiyana and Bre-
onna.

Every morning I wake up and 

pray, Pray that my ancestors’ 
dreams are fulfilled today.

My ancestors back in the moth-

erland were ripped from their 
peaceful villages and forcefully 
taken to a new country that they 
were forced to build on their 
backs. For 200 years, they tilled 
soil and farmed land with the 
faint hope that one day we might 
achieve freedom, that one day, we 
might get a share of our owners’ 
wealth. Despite all we gave, these 
owners bound us with chains, beat 
us with whips and instilled fear 
into our hearts. 400 years later, 
we are still put in chains by Paul 
Ryan nearly decimating Medicaid, 
by John Roberts allowing states to 
gut our voting rights, by Trump 
emboldening the “very fine peo-
ple on both sides.” Don’t even get 
me started on our fallen brother 
Clarence Thomas discrediting the 
affirmative action that got him 
into Yale Law School. Not only are 
we put down by politicians who 
don’t believe we belong here, but 
we are kept down by the police 
who have internalized their own 
privilege and hate us even though 
they do not know us.

Every morning I wake up and 

pray, Pray that, upon Officer 
Chauvin, guilt will weigh.

I believe that police have a criti-

cal function in the workings of 
any civil society, but some officers 
have replaced their mandate of 
“protect and serve” with “harass 
and demonize.” I believe that most 
policemen and women wear their 
badge with honor, but no Ameri-
can who believes in the freedom 
that this country purports to offer 
should be alright with a border 
patrolman who shoots a Mexican 
teenager across the border. We 

should not ignore a man whose 
hands are up but still gets shot. 
We absolutely should not be 
okay with a police officer who 
kneels on a Black man’s throat 
for allegedly counterfeiting a 
$20 bill. See, if you accept these 
atrocities, you don’t just support 
the police, you are a racist plain 
and simple and, if you do not 
actively oppose it, you implicitly 
support it.

Every morning, I wake up and 

pray, Pray that I can secure the 
blessings of Liberty today.

My grandfather is and will 

always be my hero. He embod-
ies the kind of heroism that we 
all should strive for because it’s 
not written in history books, but 
it entails waking up every single 
day and trying to make your cor-
ner of the world marginally better. 
He worked his whole life, being 
one of the first Black swimmers 
in Detroit, serving in the military 
during World War II and work-
ing as a public servant back in the 
city for more than 40 years. After 
he retired, he worked every day 
to teach all 16 of his grandchil-
dren what it meant to be a Black 
person in the United States, and 
what it could mean. He taught me 
that being Black means standing 
up for your community, but it can 
also mean growing prize-winning 
hydrangeas. It means lifting up 
our neighbors, but it can also mean 
beating people at Bid Whist. In his 
96 years on this Earth, he spent 
every day securing more bless-
ings of liberty for me, my sisters, 
my mother and my city. To honor 
his legacy, it is my responsibility to 
not only further secure the rights 
that he fought for but also to fight 
to spread these rights to more of 
my downtrodden brothers and sis-
ters. The most important of these 
rights is the right to live without 
the deadly consequences of police 
brutality. However, it does not just 
fall on me, it falls on all of us to bat-
tle every day to make our corners 
of the world, and thus the world 
itself, better. So, go out and peace-
fully protest today, but tomorrow, 
the next day, the next week and 
the next month, try to improve 
someone else’s life because large 
barriers cannot be broken by one 
protest.

Every morning I wake up and 

pray, Pray that my Black life will 
matter today.

Protests or no protests, I wake up Black

Confronting a legacy 
of racism in country

Black squares. Thoughts and prayers. 

“Love,” heart emojis and hashtags. That 
about sums up the country music communi-
ty’s response to the recent uprisings for racial 
justice that were sparked by the murders 
of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud 
Arbery and so many others. Instead of using 
their platforms to advocate for change and 
denounce white supremacy, many country 
artists have been reprehensibly quiet. 

As a longtime fan of the genre, I’d be lying 

if I said I was surprised by the silence. Art-
ists’ flowery calls for “peace” and “unity” 
might as well be plucked from the lyrics of 
hit songs like Tim McGraw’s “Humble and 
Kind” or Luke Bryan’s “Most People Are 
Good.” Fear of backlash for taking a stance 
is so prevalent in country music, the pre-
sumed resulting downfall for doing so has its 
own verb: getting “Dixie Chicked.” But don’t 
get me wrong. This isn’t the time to lament 
artists’ avoidance of anything “political” or 
make excuses for a culture that skirts around 
the “controversial.” It’s time to get specific. 
We need to talk about country music’s rela-
tionship with white supremacy.

Before there was “country music” and 

“R&B,” there was “hillbilly” or “old time” 
music and “race records.” “Hillbilly music” 
was strictly sung by white people, while 
“race records” were exclusively recorded 
by Black people. But the music itself? It was 
all the same kind of sound. Predominantly 
poor Southerners, white and Black, had been 
swapping songs, techniques and styles for 
years. Much before the recording industry, 
which got its start in the 1920s, could offi-
cially start to segregate the music by using 
different labels. Hank Williams, for example, 
learned to play guitar from the Black street 
performer Rufus “Tee-Tot” Payne. Lesley 
Riddle, a Black musician, accompanied A.P. 
Carter of the Carter Family on song-collect-
ing trips throughout Appalachia. 

Of course, appropriation is important to 

this story too. Few people know of “Tee-Tot” 
Payne or Lesley Riddle, but Hank Williams 
and the Carter Family are country music 
legends. How many other influential Black 
musicians have been forgotten, only to have 
their contributions live on, and be credited 
to, white performers? The history of the 
banjo provides another example. Today, 
the banjo is a decidedly country instru-
ment associated with whiteness. But, it has 
African origins. The banjo was a plantation 
instrument solely played by enslaved people 
decades before blackface entertainers popu-
larized it in minstrel shows in the 1830s. 

The institutions dedicated to telling coun-

try music’s story have played a part in pre-
serving the myth of its essential whiteness. 
Three out of the 139 members of the Coun-
try Music Hall of Fame are Black. The label 
executives who guide country music’s future 
have contributed as well. When Charley 
Pride was first releasing records in 1967, his 
label didn’t send promotional pictures of him 
to radio. Darius Rucker’s country career was 
only made possible by his previous success 
as the Hootie and the Blowfish frontman. 
The narratives surrounding the careers of 
newcomers Kane Brown and Jimmie Allen 
are examples of this too. As successful Black 
country artists, they have been tokenized — 
simultaneously used to represent industry 
“inclusion” and made to feel like they don’t 
belong, like Black music and Black people 
aren’t key to country music’s very existence. 
This is acutely insulting when so many 
hit songs on country radio today are heav-
ily influenced by hip hop and R&B. Thomas 
Rhett’s rise to fame was bolstered by synths, 
sound effects and dance beats. Sam Hunt lit-
erally raps on almost all of his songs. Their 
acceptance as “country” has been met with 
criticism, but Rhett and Hunt, both white, 
have been accepted nonetheless. The same 
can’t be said for Lil Nas X. “Old Town Road” 
was excluded from Billboard’s Hot Country 
chart for “not being country enough” — a 
move that echoes the decision to separate 
genres by race from nearly 100 years ago. 

This history has cultivated a culture that 

is not only unwelcoming of non-whiteness, 
but distinctly anti-Black. A few weeks ago, 
I came across a post that some of country’s 
more outspoken artists were sharing on their 
Instagram stories. Rachel Berry, a Black 
country music lover, shared the nervousness 
she’s experienced while attending concerts. 
Before buying tickets, she looks up “the 
name of the town/city and then ‘racism,’” 
when she wants to stand up for a song, she 
worries “‘what if someone yells a racial slur 
at me?’” and when she walks through a festi-
val full of confederate flags, Berry writes that 
she feels “uneasy.” Her story went viral and 
for good reason. Everything she wrote seems 
obvious upon reading it. But having gone to 
quite a few country music concerts myself, I 
have to confront the less obvious fact that my 
whiteness has shielded me from those kinds 
of worries. When I’ve seen confederate flags 
waving in the parking lot of a concert venue 
or printed on a fan’s t-shirt, I have had the 
privilege of merely looking away. How many 
Black country fans haven’t seen their favor-
ite artists in concert for their own safety?

Film and the history 
of racism in America

In the summer of 2016, my cousin and I saw 

“Southside with You,” a biographical indie film 
depicting Barack and Michelle Obama’s first 
date in 1989, filled with intelligent conversa-
tions between the future POTUS and FLO-
TUS about everything from bigotry to desserts. 
After Michelle and Barack watch a screening 
of Spike Lee’s 1989 film “Do the Right Thing,” 
the two run into a white colleague from their 
law firm, who expresses confusion about the 
film’s end: Mookie (the film’s main character, 
played by Lee) throws a garbage can through 
the storefront window and incites violence 
from bystanders. Barack tells his colleague that 
Mookie did it to save the white storeowner — a 
common justification used by people who didn’t 
understand the film — but after he and Michelle 
are alone, he makes the truth clear: “Mookie 
threw that trash can because he was fucking 
angry.”

These words have been echoing through my 

mind as I watch the Black Lives Matter move-
ment unfold over the death of George Floyd. 
Between the peaceful protests and strong social 
media coverage, some people have focused on 
moments of violence and looting peppered 
throughout the movement, finding riots to be 
just as coarse and confusing as white audienc-
es did in 1989. White critics and viewers who 
watched “Do the Right Thing” in 1989 clung 
to their explanation because they struggled to 
comprehend the place of violence in the conflict 
— if Mookie threw the trash can with the good 
intentions of saving Sal, they think, then the vio-
lence is justified. The belief that violence dele-
gitimizes the movement only demonstrates that 
these people don’t understand the conflict. And 
the fact that I was surprised by Barack’s com-
ment while watching this movie in 2016 means 
that I don’t really understand it either.

These past few weeks have seen a whirlwind 

of protests as the Black Lives Matter movement 
gains steam across the country. There are many 
ways to get involved, whether it’s marching in 
protests, donating to bail funds or buying from 
Black-owned businesses. It’s also crucial for 
non-Black allies to take this time and educate 
themselves. There are many ways to do this: 
reading books or articles, listening to podcasts, 
watching speeches from community leaders, 
etc. Simple education on the Civil Rights move-
ment is half the battle; the other half is forcing 
yourself to realign your view of the world to 
match those who have been oppressed for cen-
turies. I turned to watching films, inspired by 
lists I’d seen circulating around social media. 
Film has long been an effective method of tell-
ing stories that aren’t always told and sharing 
voices that aren’t always heard, capable of fill-
ing in some blanks left by the American educa-
tion system. Fictional or not, these stories are 
powerful, able to humanize people that are 
consistently dehumanized by the system and 
the media.

In January, I reviewed “Clemency” for the 

Daily, heralding it as a tragic but important 
depiction of the crippling prison system and 
death row. What I didn’t mention is that it took 
days after I’d watched it to process the full force 
of the story. It was a glimpse into a system so 
broken and destructive — murder that is sanc-
tified because the state said it was okay, based 
on a crime that the man likely didn’t do. By 
becoming embedded in the story, you’re forced 
to acknowledge the sheer inhumanity of the 
system. Understanding the consequences of 
institutionalized racism and realities of police 
brutality is not simple — there are many layers 
to the conflict, extending from the macro to the 
micro.

Fourteen-year-old Jalaiah Harmon cho-

reographed the famous “Renegade” dance 
in September 2019. She posted it on the 
social video app Funimate and by October 
the bouncy set of moves had been recreated 
on TikTok. It was quickly popularized by 
influencer Charli D’Amelio and by early 
2020 the dance had reached unprecedent-
ed stardom. The choreography floated 
into seemingly every corner of the internet 
and many offline dance parties. But as the 
trend raked in millions upon millions of 
followers, Harmon found herself looking 
on with confusion — she hadn’t been given 
credit for any of it. 

Harmon’s story was eventually well-

documented: The New York Times offered 
a thoughtful deep-dive, and the young 
dancer landed a performance on “The Ellen 
Show” as well as at the NBA All-Star game. 
She eventually met D’Amelio, who seemed 
enthusiastic to have found the dance’s orig-
inal owner. But the “Renegade” story is one 
of many anecdotes often used to describe 
the unfair realities of what NYT called 
“The Viral Dance-iarchy.” Odd nomencla-
ture aside, the phenomenon is real — it’s 
the process by which white mainstream 
TikTok creators co-opt the work of less 
well-known Black choreographers on apps 
like Funimate or Dubsmash. 

While important, many writers who aim 

to bring attention to this issue tell the story 
from a solely technological angle. Tik-
Tok doesn’t include a system for crediting 
choreographers which, while problematic, 
does not tell the whole story. Occasionally 
a more thorough commentary will discuss 
the “Renegade” issue in the historical con-
text of white people co-opting hip-hop 
music and dance, but the reality goes deep-
er than one genre.

At a recent symposium with The Muse-

um at the Fashion Institute of Technology, 
activist and former ballet dancer Theresa 
Ruth Howard gave a presentation about 
Black history in American ballet, telling 
a story remarkably similar to Harmon’s 
“Renegade.” Specifically, Howard talked 
about George Balanchine, who founded the 
School of American Ballet in 1934 and the 
New York City Ballet in 1948. Backed by the 
success of these institutions, Balanchine 
became the most influential dancemaker 
of the 20th century. He choreographed 465 
ballets in his lifetime and with them forged 
a completely new aesthetic with which 
America now approaches the art form. 

Howard quoted historian Brenda Dixon 

Gottschild in saying that Balanchine’s 

technique is marked by “angular arms, 
turned-in legs, bent knees, pelvic and chest 
articulation and displacement, leg kicks, 
heightened speed (and) densely layered 
phrases.” Today, it’s these characteristics 
that are revered as genius innovation but, 
as Gottschild noted, “these same elements 
are basic syllables of Africanist dance lan-
guages.” 

Howard’s talk elaborated on this last 

point: She pointed to the similarities 
between Balanchine’s emphasis of plié and 
the bent-knees of jazz and Balanchine’s 
focus on creating the rhythm of the step 
before the actual movement, a process 
similar to tap dancing. Howard also noted 
Balanchine’s famous intention to create an 
integrated black-white ballet company as 
early as the 1940s, but clarified this overly 
moralistic history with racist quotes that 
suggest his intentions lay more in want-
ing to acquire access to Black musicality 
than actually wanting different skin colors 
onstage.

The presentation also included several 

clips of Arthur Mitchell, who became the 
first Black dancer at NYCB in 1955 and 
later founded Dance Theatre of Harlem. 
Howard’s 1997 clip shows Mitchell telling 
his audience “many people did not realize… 
(Balanchine) told us ‘if you want beautiful 
hands go take Spanish dancing,’ he said ‘if 
you want to use the back take Dunham.’ He 
always used all the different techniques at 
that particular time.” In the clip, Mitchell 
perks up from his seat to demonstrate each 
of his examples, his eyes brightening at the 
prospect of such collaboration. He tells his 
audience about a love of Fred Astaire and 
Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, bouncing out of 
his chair to reenact photos of Balanchine, 
affectionately nicknamed Mr. B: “You 
never never see him (just standing), he’s 
always like this! or that! Utilizing the form 
of jazz, what we call jazz today.”

Thus, Balanchine’s ballet is a diverse 

meld of people and places, and according 
to Mitchell he wanted his dancers to know 
the source of each. As Howard puts it, it’s 
the product of “organic cultural intersec-
tionality influence and cross-pollination 
that is life.” If this is true, why are we not 
teaching our dance students such history? 
Why are we not writing it in our programs? 
Why are we not making sure that every 
generation after Balanchine also under-
stands where this technique comes from 
and how to value the communities that 
supported it?

Matching strides, we inch forward and 

we stagger back. We readjust and begin 
again. We are followers of the person in 
front of us and leaders of those behind. 
The uninterrupted balance of bodies bus-
tling close to each other reminds me of 
poetry, the kind written for moments like 
these. There is rhythm behind the pain in 
our steps. There are rhymes in the chants 
we shout. I see the symbolism in the fists 
raised: a sign of solidarity and support; a 
salute to express the united resistance. 

It’s an enduring salutation. The united 

resistance around me thumps like a beat-
ing heart. Underneath us it pulses. The 
heartbeat has revived from a movement 
long ago. In 1935, poet and renowned fig-
ure of the Harlem Renaissance Langston 
Hughes wrote the poem “Let America Be 
America Again.” He focuses on the Amer-
ican dream and the near impossibility of 
many to attain it and protests the Ameri-
can slogan of freedom that excludes him 
and many others: “There’s never been 
equality for me / Nor freedom in this 
‘homeland of the free.’” He identifies with 
all the oppressed peoples that built Amer-
ica and ignites the urge for them all to rise 
up: a united resistance. The repetition in 
his cries for his land and people signifies 
that this fight is far from over; that this 
heart is still beating. 

I stand in the heart of a thousand-

person crowd on one of the busiest inter-
states in Michigan. It’s June 6, 2020, and 
we’re marching for the Black Lives Mat-
ter movement. I’m close behind a young 
Black woman with a megaphone. In it, 
she shouts “When your feet hurt, remem-
ber why you’re walking! When your arms 
hurt from holding your sign, think of how 
many of us have died holding our hands 

up!” 

Maya Angelou wrote the poem “Still I 

Rise” in 1978. The defiant message of the 
poem takes me back to the protest, to the 
speaker in front of me. In the poem, Ange-
lou refuses to succumb to the oppressor’s 
hate: “You may write me down in history 
/ With your bitter, twisted lies, / You may 
trod me in the very dirt, / But still, like 
dust, I’ll rise.” Angelou uses anaphora, 
the repetition of the phrase “you may” in 
the beginning of several verses. It reit-
erates the never-ending attempts of the 
oppressor to keep her down, and serves 
to amplify the inevitability of her defeat 
over this adversity. Both Angelou and the 
protest speaker remind me who we are 
fighting for. 

The arrangement of the individuals is 

like the syntax of a poem; we are each 
unique bodies but the organization of 
us all brings us together. As we march 
entangled together the enjambment of 
our rows signifies that the fight is never-
ending. There is no time for rest. We have 
to keep moving. 

The police at this protest watch from 

their cars. They are parked to block the 
road from the other side of the highway. 
Whenever I spot their vehicles I hear 
Harryette Mullen’s “We Are Not Respon-
sible.” Written in 2002, Mullen narrates 
the dehumanization of the language of 
authority officials in this poem. The lan-
guage she uses is balanced with nearly 
every line having the same amount of syl-
lables. It juxtaposes the threat beneath 
the lines, and emphasizes the final vio-
lent line that fails to fall in order: “Please 
remain calm, or we can’t be held respon-
sible / for what happens to you.” She pro-
tests the misuse of power and degrading 
standards of these officials.

Resentment: the 
politiciation of emotion to 
liberate the colonied

GABRIJELA SKOKO

MiC Managing Edtior

The revolutionary nature of Glen Sean 

Coulthard’s book, “Red Skin, White Masks: 
Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recogni-
tion,” serves as a salute to radical scholar 
Frantz Fanon’s postcolonial work through 
its exposure of Canada’s systematic mar-
ginalisation of the Native population. In like 
manner, the piece introduces an uncomfort-
able notion of the indoctrinated white val-
ues, instilled to naturalise the corruption of 
Indigenous culture and self-value which per-
sist today in relation to the Aboriginals who 
suffer from psycho-affective attachments 
to colonialism and an internalised justifi-
cation of their own subjugation. Coulthard 
proposes that this subconscious surrender-
ing of the Aboriginal people creates a stable 
environment for the Canadians’ perpetual, 
yet subtle, reproduction of colonialism today. 
However, at some point, the colonised 
becomes “aware” of the coloniser, birthing 
resentment within the colonised, and forcing 
progress toward proper recognition and reco 
nciliation from the coloniser. 

Coulthard expresses modern society’s 

colonial persistence as straddled between 
the coloniser’s denial of the oppressive 
structure and the indoctrinated submis-
sion of the colonised. He does this by prob-
ing the non-Native’s refusal to decolonise 
through the implementation of “transitional 
justice” in a non-transitional structure and 
an ignorance regarding resentment’s politi-
cal value. However, he goes on to challenge 
this “unchangeable” system, making use of 
Fanon’s embracement of resentment as an 
essential instrument in the resurgence of self 
and cultural affirmation. 

Attempts to reconcile injustices against 

Canada’s Indigenous people have taken form 
of reparative commissions and elaborate 
promises to rectify the unbalanced system, 
yet the implementation of these reparations 
have failed as result of the non-Natives Con-
tradictory denial of colonial history, and a 
palpable refusal to practice their own pro-
posed processes. 

Meant to guide the Canadian State 

through a somewhat seamless process of 
reconciliation, the Royal Commission of 
Aboriginal Peoples details a productive prac-
tice of “transitional justice”: an approach 
to justice which must take place after the 
injustice has ceased and there is a clear dis-
tinction between the time of injustice and 
the time following. In Canada, society has 
perpetuated a “non-transitional” loop that 
maintains the settler-colonial relationship 
and erases any distinction between that 
of the past, present and future. Coulthard 
explains that regardless, Canada wields the 

Pride Month meets the 
Black Liberation movement

June 2020 marks the 50th anniversary of 

the LGBTQ+ Pride traditions, which annu-
ally celebrate freedom of sexual identity and 
commemorate the Stonewall Riots of 1969. 
Now more than ever, June is the intersection 
point for Pride Month and the Black Lib-
eration movement. There have been many 
unofficial intersections between historical 
Black Liberation movements and LGBTQ+ 
progress and vice versa, however the ampli-
fication of the LGBTQ+ Black community is 
reaching a possibly unprecedented level of 
recognition and support worldwide. Since 
the end of May, protesters from all 50 states 
and at least 40 other countries in six conti-
nents have taken to the streets to demand an 
end to systemic racism and police brutality.

Tony McDade, a Black transgender man, 

was shot and killed by a police officer in Tal-
lahasee, Fla., on May 27. As a being whose 
identity is dually-oppressed, McDade is 
among the many Black transgender people 
who have been a victim to anti-LGBTQ+ 
and anti-Black violence. Less than two 
weeks after his death, two Black transgen-
der women, Riah Milton and Dominique 
“Rem’Mie” Fells, were killed on the same 
day. In 2020 alone, there have been at least 15 
violent deaths of transgender or gender non-
conforming people in the United States — the 
majority of which were women of color, par-
ticularly Black transgender women. 

The names George Floyd, Breonna Tay-

lor and Ahmaud Arbery have been plastered 
across hundreds of headlines and memori-
alized by anti-racist allies over the past few 
weeks. As always, the energy put towards 
supporting the Black transgender commu-
nity pales in comparison. Black transgender 
people are disproportionately discriminated 
against in housing, employment, healthcare 
and policing systems. Nonetheless, main-

stream media and political leaders are com-
plicit in this discrimination and perpetuate 
the racist, sexist and transphobic harras-
ment they face on a daily basis.

The Trump administration announced 

it will eradicate protections for transgen-
der patients from sex discrimination two 
weeks into Pride month. The announcement 
occured on the fourth anniversary of the 
Pulse nightclub shooting and during the cur-
rent COVID-19 pandemic, when the Black 
LGBTQ+ community is being exposed at 
large. Healthcare is a fundamental right all 
humans should have access to, yet 1 out of 5 
transgender or non-conforming people have 
reported being denied healthcare on the 
basis of their gender. The ruling is not only 
a direct attack against trans rights but is also 
one which disproportionately affects Black 
transgender people. Over 20 percent of Black 
transgender people reported to be HIV-posi-
tive compared to 2.64 percent of transgender 
people of all races. Black transgender people 
are also affected by HIV in far greater num-
bers compared to the general Black popu-
lation and the general U.S. population, 2.4 
percent and 0.60 percent, respectively. 

Removing protections against discrimina-

tion in healthcare worsens the health crisis 
of Black transgender people. Their access 
to medication would become more limited 
if denied treatment by medical profession-
als, and they would have to resort to using 
illegal or non-prescription drugs, which can 
put their physical and mental well-being at 
a higher risk, while forcing them to practice 
criminalized survival. 

We must fight for Black LGBTQ+ lives 

and LGBTQ+ lives must fight for Black lives. 
In order to dismantle systemic racism in all 
degrees of civic life, we must not pick which 
battles are worth fighting for. All Black lives 
matter: It can not be exclusive...

proposal of this transitional system to disas-
sociate past colonialism with their modern-
day cultural hierarchy: “Where there is no 
period marking a clear or formal transition 
from an authoritarian past to a democratic 
present— state-sanctioned approaches must 
ideologically manufacture such a transition 
by allocating the abuses of settler colonisa-
tion to the dustbins of history.”

Canada relies on the internalised system 

and manipulative policy enforcement which 
they exhaust to restrict the rights of Indig-
enous people. The enforcement of extin-
guishment, the Modified Rights Approach, 
the non-assertion approach and the Jobs 
and Growth Bill Act all served as mediums 
of institutionalised outlets for Indigenous 
subjugation. 

Coulthard explains that decorative lan-

guage such as “restorative justice” creates 
an environment in which reconciliation 
becomes fixated on the “legacy of past abuse, 
not the abusive colonial structure itself.” 
When colonial corruption is categorized 
as historical, it liberates the coloniser from 
responsibility in today’s disparate relation-
ship, assuming blame to the colonised who 
must have an inability to move on. This 
way, the coloniser can maintain their sys-
tematic superiority by disguising the cur-
rent settler-colonial structure as an invalid, 
negative emotion harboured by the Natives 
toward the non-Natives which prevents the 
advancement of their mutual relationship. 

In embracing the standpoint of transition-

al justice, the coloniser assumes the Natives’ 
resentment to be irrational and it is framed 
as the primal perpetuator of the social and 
political instability at hand. This common 
misunderstanding of resentment confuses 
the emotion for the subjectively less produc-
tive french term: ressentiment. Ressenti-
ment is “portrayed as a reactive, backward, 
and passive orientation to the world;” under 
this definition, the once subjugated has been 
liberated in a literal sense but fosters this 
subjugation in a conscious refusal to move on 
from the past, ultimately subjugating them-
selves. 

The difference is resentment’s politicised 

nature, making it a powerful foundation for 
reconciliation. Resentment is formed against 
a recognized “enemy of injustice;” recogniz-
ing this “colonial enemy” frees the colonized 
from their internalized subjugation and 
compels them to revalidate their individual 
and cultural worth. Coulthard defines this 
Fanon-inspired process as, “a purging, if you 
will, of the so-called ‘inferiority complex’ of 
the colonized subject … In such a context, the 
formation of a colonial ‘enemy’ … signifies a 
collapse of this internalized psychic...

A brief history of Black Muslims in 
America

NOOR MOUGHNI

MiC Staff Writer

The American stigma around 

Islam often recognizes Muslim 
Americans as a recent addition 
to the nation, failing to recognize 
Black Muslims arrived with the 
first slave ship to reach Virginia’s 
coast in 1619. 

The first large influx of Muslim 

Americans were Black Muslims 
captured from Africa and enslaved 
upon arrival to America. An esti-
mated 30 percent of the African 
slaves brought to the U.S. from 
West and Central African coun-
tries were Muslim. The conditions 
of slavery were not only physically 
inhumane, these people were tar-
geted for their faith and forcefully 
oppressed into different belief sys-
tems. Many enslaved people were 
forced to convert to Christianity 
in an attempt to “civilize” them. In 
an effort to reject the assimilation 
of American culture forced upon 
them, enslaved Muslims turned to 
creative outlets such as music to 
preserve their religion and culture. 

Defending DACA

Deferred 
Action 
for 
Child-

hood Arrivals is an Obama-era 
implemented policy which grants 
temporary protection to undocu-
mented children who have been 
brought to and raised in the United 
States. For many, this is the only 
country they know. 700,000 DACA 
recipients feel as if America is their 
home. DACA recipients are allowed 
to obtain a renewable two-year 
period of protection against depor-
tation which gives children across 
the United States the opportunity 
to go to work, attend school and 
live a somewhat normal life. All 
DACA recipients have been here 
for at least thirteen years — per 
USCIS requirement for the DACA 
application — so to many recipi-
ents, this executive protection is a 
form of acceptance from a country 
they consider home.

Across the United States, there 

are over 200,000 DACA recipients

working as essential workers pro-
tecting the health of Americans, 
among other jobs, and contribut-
ing to the well-being of the younger 
generation as educators. Currently, 
estimated 29,000 health care work-
ers are DACA recipients. Through-
out the COVID-19 pandemic, they 
have been on the frontline putting 
their own lives at risk for their 
communities. Some DACA recipi-
ents are also teachers who uplift 
young students by setting them up 
for success. They are an intricate 
part of our society that contribute 
to many aspects of our social struc-
ture and community development. 

The DACA program has not 

only positively impacted their sur-
rounding communities, but it has 
also demonstrated that it can ame-
liorate mental health outcomes for 
DACA-eligible individuals. It has 
even alleviated poverty in immi-
grant households, according to a 
study executed by Catalina Amue-
do-Dorantes. It is an extraordinary 
executive policy that inherently 

stands for inclusivity, empathy and 
acceptance.

Unfortunately, 
the 
current 

Trump administration is against 
the implementation of the DACA 
program. The current renewal 
process for DACA recipients is 
still available; however, no new 
applications are being accepted. 
The Supreme Court’s conservative 
majority has sided with the Trump 
administration to abolish the pro-
gram, while the liberal justices 
acknowledge the urgency of main-
taining such an essential program. 
This is a plight for humanity and 
survival that is affecting millions 
nationwide. 

The Supreme Court has until 

the end of June this year to release 
their decision regarding the pres-
ervation of the DACA program. 
As the court decision looms over 
the whole country, it is salient that 
allies continue protesting, spread-
ing awareness and, most impor-
tantly, plan to vote to fight for the 
DACA recipients in our country.

Following the legal abolition of 

slavery in 1865, many Black Ameri-
cans experienced sentiments of 
displacement and lack of identity 
and culture, seeing as their enslav-
ers had also stripped them of their 
heritages. Historian Sally How-
ell explains how the 1920s were 
essential to the reshaping of the 
Black American identity. Howell 
claims, “ [Black Americans] began 
to embrace Islam in the 1920s and 
30s partially in response to the rad-
ical dislocations and racism they 
experienced prior to and during 
the Great Migration (the movement 
of disenfranchised southerners to 
industrial regions in the North).” 
This American embracement of 
Islam initiated a movement that 
would advocate for Islam as one of 
the lost elements of African heri-
tage. 

The link between Pan-African-

ism and Islam is first shown in 
Marcus Garvey’s Negro World. In 
conjunction with the popularity of 
this newspaper, other Black-Ameri-

can Muslim organizations began to 
form. Arguably, the most notable of 
these organizations is The Nation 
of Islam. The NOI was founded 
in Detroit in 1930 by Wallace fard 
Muhammad, and helped lay the 
groundwork for Islam’s influential 
role in the Black Power movement 
and the Civil Rights movement of 
the 1950s and 1960s.

The NOI, along with other Black 

Nationalist Muslim movements at 
the time, centralized the belief that 
Christianity was a “white man’s 
religion.” In this sense, Islam was 
acknowledged as a liberating ide-
ology that could separate Black 
America from their Christian sla-
veowners. The NOI is currently led 
by Louis Farrakhan, but does not 
have nearly as much influence in 
Black American communities as it 
once did.

The encouragement of Black 

racial 
superiority 
was 
later 

denounced by some former lead-
ers of the NOI, such as Malcolm X, 
but the impact of these movements 
were monumental in the spread of 
Islam throughout Black communi-
ties in the 50s and 60s.

Following the spread of Islam in 

Black communities, more and more 
Black Muslims began overtak-
ing key roles in American politics 
and society. The two first Muslim 
Americans sworn into Congress 
also happened to be Black Ameri-
can Muslims—Keith Ellison and 
Andre Carson. Muhammad Ali 
was a Black Muslim American who 
is regarded as one of the greatest 
boxers of all time. Ibtihaj Muham-
mad is a professional fencer who 
was the first Muslim woman to 
win an Olympic medal competing 
for the United States. As a result 
of Muhammad’s numerous acco-
lades and awards in her field, she 
was honored by Mattel with a Bar-
bie doll in her likeness —the first 
Barbie doll to wear a hijab. Hali-
ma Aden is an American Fashion 
model who has also had many firsts 
as a Black visibly-Muslim woman 
in the fashion industry. Aden was 
the first Muslim woman to appear 
on a cover of Sports Illustrated 
magazine wearing a burkini and 
among many other accomplish-
ments, Aden was recently named 
this year’s Daily Front Row “Break-

through Model.” 

The far-reaching spread of Islam 

in Black communities is also heav-
ily reflected in hip-hop and rap 
music. Prominent artists such as 
Rakim, Busta Rhymes and Mos Def 
reference Islam throughout many 
of their songs. The teachings of the 
Five Percent Nation are also shown 
throughout these two genres. One 
of the most recent examples being 
Jay Electronica’s “A Written Testi-
mony.” This album, similar to work 
from other Black Muslim musi-
cians, is evidence of the early influ-
ence Islamic groups such as the 
NOI had on Black Americans.

As for the current demographics 

of Muslim Americans, Sulayman 
Nyang, Howard University African 
studies professor, claimed in 2005 
that of the five million Muslims in 
America, Black Americans make 
up the largest percentage of that 
group — about 25 percent.

late the entire complex history of 
Black Muslim Americans...

Eastern transfer halted by admissions

For 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball 
team, 
Wednesday 

delivered yet another hiccup in 
an already bumpy offseason.

Just a month after his surprise 

commitment to the Wolverines, 
Purdue transfer guard Nojel 
Eastern announced that he will 
no longer be heading to Ann 
Arbor.

“I was not admitted to the 

University because of many 
credits that weren’t transferable 
because of my major,” Eastern 
said in a statement released 
via 
Twitter 
on 
Wednesday. 

“That is the only reason why 
I was not accepted. I say this 
to say that I will be reopening 
my 
recruitment 
process 
as 

a transfer. I want (to) thank 
Michigan and the entire staff 
and organization for trying to 
do everything in (their) power 

to get into the University of 
Michigan.”

The 
program 
never 

acknowledged 
his 
initial 

transfer 
announcement, 
and 

Eastern clarified that it fell 
through 
due 
to 
academic 

reasons. At Purdue, he was 
working toward a major in 
selling and sales management.

Michigan will no longer be 

welcoming one of the Big Ten’s 
best perimeter defenders to its 
roster. He originally intended 
to join coach Juwan Howard 
for his final remaining year of 
eligibility, but whether or not 
he’d be immediately eligible 
was unclear. He did not enter 
the transfer portal as a graduate 
transfer, meaning he would’ve 
had to sit out the 2020-21 season 
unless the NCAA granted him a 
waiver.

The Evanston, Ill. native was 

the 84th-ranked recruit coming 
out of high school in 2017 and 
while Eastern’s defense is held 

in high regard, his offensive 
game has never reached such 
heights. He averaged just 4.9 
points and 4.0 rebounds as a 
junior last season, which was a 

step back from his 7.5 points and 
5.5 rebounds as a sophomore.

After 
the 
graduation 
of 

Zavier Simpson, the Wolverines 
could’ve turned to Eastern to 
help fill the void at point guard 
this coming year if he was ruled 
eligible. Though his shooting 

woes have prevented him from 
taking the next step as a college 
player, Eastern was effective 
as a ball handler in screen sets 
during his time at Purdue. 
The Boilermakers didn’t run 
a 
screen-heavy 
offense 
like 

Michigan, but it would’ve been 
interesting to see how Eastern’s 
limited effectiveness translated 
to a new system.

The 
Wolverines 
will 
still 

welcome 
two 
additional 

backcourt 
transfers 
in 

Columbia’s Mike Smith and 
Wake Forest’s Chaundee Brown. 
The latter is still going through 
the admissions process, and 
a decision has not yet been 
reached on his eligibility status 
for next season.

With Eastern no longer in 

the fold, the Wolverines have 
one 
remaining 
scholarship 

available for 2020-21. Howard 
can now pursue a high school 
reclassification candidate, turn 
back to the transfer portal or 
pocket the extra scholarship 
for now in order to spend it on a 
2021 recruit.

‘M’ turns around recruiting in Spring

On 
March 
13, 
when 
the 

NCAA 
announced 
a 
freeze 

on recruiting visits amid the 
COVID-19 pandemic, Michigan 
held just two commitments for 
its 2021 class. By contrast, Ohio 
State — holders of the year’s top-
ranked class — already held nine, 
including a trio of five stars.

And stripped of the ability to 

host recruits for their Spring 
Game or travel for in-home visits, 
the Wolverines’ late start to 
2021 proceedings had suddenly 
turned from intriguing to dire.

Three months later, Michigan’s 

situation 
is 
vastly 
different. 

Buoyed 
by 
15 
commitments 

since late March, its 2021 class 
now ranks sixth in the nation 
— a mark, should it hold, that 
would be the second best of the 
Harbaugh era.

To get there, the Wolverines 

needed to adapt their recruiting 
tenets of honesty and persistence 
to a fully-digitized world. In the 
absence of in-person recruiting, 
schools around the country have 
upped their creativity, giving 
recruits a virtual look at life on 

campus. Notably, Michigan State 
created a series of online visits 
dubbed The Festival.

But while other schools have 

revolutionized their recruiting 
process, Michigan has stuck to 
the basics. According to recruits, 
players can see the campus on a 
YouTube video that the program 
sends 
out, 
while 
academic 

advisors are available to video 
chat. If players want, they’re 
linked up with assistant coaches 
to show them around the team’s 
facilities.

“You’re finding all creative 

ways 
(to 
recruit),” 
offensive 

coordinator Josh Gattis said 
in a teleconference on May 14. 
“Whether 
it’s 
virtual 
visits, 

whether it’s virtual meetings, 
FaceTimes, you’ve got to be as 
creative as possible to be able 
to showcase your university and 
program in these times when 
they currently can’t come visit.”

None of that, though, is why 

Michigan’s class turned from 
barren to loaded in the span of 
three socially-distanced months.

“(The 
virtual 
visits) 
all 

accomplished the same thing,” 
three-star 
offensive 
lineman 

Tristan Bounds told The Daily 

this week. “I think Michigan just 
has so much to show and it’s so 
impressive, that’s what separates 
it. It isn’t like they did something 
different really per se, it’s just 
like it’s Michigan. So that’s 
what’s different.”

But 
to 
showcase 
that, 

Michigan had to take advantage 
of the benefits offered by the 
pandemic. In place of spring 
practices and recruiting visits, 
the Wolverines’ coaching staff 
was left with one critical benefit 
over a typical spring: time.

On the recruiting trail, that 

meant the ability to talk to 
recruits 
everyday, 
something 

they wouldn’t have been able to 
do without the pandemic.

“They were constantly talking 

to me, constantly showing me 
things they had, the benefits 
of 
going 
there,” 
four-star 

linebacker Jaydon Hood told 
The Daily. “Just the things they 
had, the tangibles they had to 
get me to the next level and that 
could make me a better football 
player, man, academic student, 
everything.”

In the end, that level of 

communication — along with 
everything 
else 
Michigan 

provides — is what allowed the 
Wolverines to build their 2021 
class.

For Bounds, that ‘everything 

else’ meant seeing four Michigan 
offensive lineman drafted last 
month. For Hood, it meant 
the coaching staff’s ability to 
mold him after Devin Bush and 
Cam McGrone. “Those are two 
players I watch and try to mimic 
my game off anyways,” Hood 
said. “So just compared to them 
speaks of how highly they think 
of me and the level of play that I 
want to play and what they see 
me playing.”

Three months ago, neither 

player was close to committing 
to the Wolverines. Both planned 
to use the spring to see all their 
top 
schools. 
A 
commitment 

without a visit would have been 
unthinkable.

Instead, that’s the reality for 

the vast majority of Michigan’s 
2021 class.

But it’s a reality that was only 

made possible by the commitment 
that the Wolverines were able to 
show their top targets during the 
recruiting dead period.

Without that?
“My 
decision 
would’ve 

been different,” Hood said. “It 
definitely would’ve been.”

Jackson fronts dynamic special teams

When considering Giles Jackson’s 

game-breaking speed, a few plays 
come to mind.

Sure, there’s the reverse handoff 

he took 22 yards for a touchdown 
against Ohio State. Or the 40-yard 
reception off a wheel route against 
Alabama in the Citrus Bowl. But 
when examining Jackson’s full body 
of work as a freshman last fall, one 
image stands out most.

On a sunny November afternoon 

in College Park, against Maryland, 
Jackson only needed one juke to take 
the opening kickoff to the house. As 
he trotted across the goal line for 
a 97-yard touchdown, 11 Terrapins 
helplessly lagged behind him.

Jackson’s tone-setting touchdown 

against Maryland paved the way for 
a 38-7 win while simultaneously 
showcasing his value in the grand 
scheme of things. Beyond his 
increased offensive responsibilities 
as the season progressed, the 5-foot-
9 speedster averaged nearly 26 yards 
across 24 returns as Michigan’s 
primary option last season en route 
to an All-Big Ten honorable mention 
selection.

“Giles is a real ascending player,” 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said 
after the Citrus Bowl. “... He’s a true 
freshman, so I didn’t know exactly 
what you’re going to have in a true 
freshman, but he has really produced 
and had a heck of a year.”

What, exactly, did Michigan have 

in Jackson? Last fall, he became just 
the second player in program history 
to score a touchdown by rushing, 
receiving and kick returning in the 
same season. And he did it at 17 years 
old.

Heading into his sophomore 

season, Jackson is set to spearhead 
arguably the deepest group of special 
teams returners the Wolverines 
have carried in the Harbaugh 
era. And as special of a freshman 
season as Jackson might’ve had, the 
Wolverines’ running backs coach 
and 
special 
teams 
coordinator 

Jay Harbaugh still sees untapped 
potential in Jackson’s return game.

“(Jackson) is crazy fast, super 

talented,” Jay said in a teleconference 
Friday. “He even left some yards out 
there last year that I think this year 
he’s gonna be able to take advantage 
of as he continues to improve the 
way he understands our system, 
seeing the blocking scheme develop. 
Expecting a huge year from him.”

Behind 
Jackson, 
Harbaugh 

identified presumed VIPER Mike 
Barrett, receivers Ronnie Bell and 
Mike Sainristil, running back Blake 
Corum 
and 
cornerback 
Andre 

Seldon as others who could see 
action as kick returners. Barrett, in 
particular, has proven himself as a 
blocker in the role of off-returner, 
while safety Daxton Hill and 
running back Chris Evans have also 
seen time as returners.

“(Jackson) has a great group of 

guys who are going to be able to 
compete with him, make him better 
and be back there with him,” Jay 

said. “… We feel great about the 
quality of guys back there, which is 
really necessary because as soon as 
a returner becomes a big-play threat, 
that’s when you see that guy doesn’t 
get the ball that much anymore, so it’s 
important to have someone else back 
there that is a legit big-play threat.”

As for returning punts, Michigan 

will be forced to adjust to life without 
Donovan Peoples-Jones, who left for 
the NFL during the winter following 
his junior campaign. In his three 
seasons returning punts, he racked 
up 743 yards across 89 attempts and 
scored a pair of touchdowns.

With Peoples-Jones now gone, 

the Wolverines could hand the keys 
to Bell, who returned eight punts last 
season. Michigan could also turn to 
Jackson or Barrett, while Harbaugh 
also touted the “electric” potential 
of incoming freshman receivers 
Roman Wilson and AJ Henning.

“I’m 
confident 
(Wilson 
and 

Henning) will at least be able to 
compete and push those guys,” 
Jay said. “If they can get to the 
point where they can catch it with 
confidence at some point during the 
year, they could be legit dudes as 
well.”

Regardless of which direction the 

Wolverines go, there’s no shortage 
of viable options within the group. 
And in the event multiple candidates 
prove themselves, it wouldn’t be 
surprising to see a plateau system.

But for now, it seems pretty like 

one option stands above the rest.

“We love Giles back there,” Jay 

said. “I think everybody does.”

Michigan opens up for 
some athletes to return

Michigan will join the schools 

that have allowed some athletes 
back on campus for voluntary 
workouts this week, the school 
announced in a press release 
Monday.

Football, men’s basketball and 

women’s basketball athletes will be 
allowed on campus for voluntary 
strength 
and 
conditioning 

workouts, 
returning 
in 
four 

phases. That includes a 14-day 
pre-report risk assessment, a six-
day resocialization period back to 
campus and daily risk assessments.

All athletes will be tested 

for COVID-19 and antibodies. 
There will also be team physicals, 
concussion testing, sleep surveys, 
fitness testing, mobility screening, 
body 
composition, 
nutrition 

evaluations and regular medical 
testing.

Athletes in other fall sports 

will return to campus after the 
successful 
reintroduction 
of 

football, men’s basketball and 
women’s 
basketball, 
per 
the 

release.

“We are pleased to start the 

process of welcoming student-
athletes back to our campus 
through a medical and public 
health-informed 
protocol 
and 

plan,” athletic director Warde 
Manuel said in the release. “We 
continue to take the utmost care 
to ensure that all student-athletes 
and staff return to a safe and 
healthy environment.

“Our protocols and plans have 

been developed by medical experts 
from across U-M’s campus, who 
have collaborated with officials at 
the local, state and national levels. 
I appreciate the contributions and 
comprehensive efforts across so 
many groups and in coordination 
with the Big Ten conference and 
peers across the NCAA.”

Athletes 
and 
coaches 
will 

be screened daily before being 
allowed 
into 
facilities, 
where 

high-risk areas will be sanitized 
daily. Those who test positive for 
COVID-19 will enter a quarantine.

“I am so grateful we are able to 

make our way back to Ann Arbor 
after all these months,” men’s 
basketball coach Juwan Howard 
said in a release. “It has been a very 
unusual time to say the least. What 
has been so impressive is to watch, 
read and have zoom calls to better 
understand all the efforts and new 
procedures being made — so many 
talented and caring doctors and 
administrators — to ensure we 
are safe. Make no mistake about 
it, the COVID-19 pandemic is so 
much bigger than basketball and 
we do not take that lightly. We 
have challenges ahead, but we 
know taking this first step is key to 
returning to a normal routine.”

Though the University has not 

yet announced plans to reopen 
for students in the fall, allowing 
some athletes back could be a 
natural first step towards that 
end. University President Mark 
Schlissel has said that if students 
are not on campus, there will be no 
sports.

Now, with some athletes back, 

everyone else will wait.

Rockies draft Blomgren

In the fourth round of the 

2020 MLB Draft Thursday, the 
Colorado Rockies selected junior 
shortstop Jack Blomgren with the 
140th overall pick.

The Rockies acquired a two-

way shortstop with a knack for 
getting on-base and dynamic 
infielding capabilities. Blomgren 
started almost as soon as his 
freshman campaign began and 
though he struggled offensively 
his freshman season, Blomgren’s 
career .276 batting average, .399 
on-base percentage, and .956 
fielding percentage signal the sort 
of consistency that professional 
teams seek in prospective captains 
of their infields.

Blomgren did not attract draft 

attention out of high school, but 
his characteristic work-ethic and 
competitive fire drove him to 
make the developments necessary 
to hear his name called in this 
year’s shortened draft.

“My mindset going into every 

at-bat is putting the team first 
and competing for my teammates 
behind me that are cheering 
me on,” Blomgren told The 

Daily during the 2020 season. 
“Everything I’ve put in, prepared 
for, is for the guys behind me, and 
that’s what’s so important for this 
whole team and for me especially.”

The 
fact 
that 
Blomgren 

speaks of setting up for the guys 
behind him makes sense given 
his tendency to hit singles, but 
his growing ability to drive in 
runs himself is perhaps his most 
interesting development during 
his time in Ann Arbor.

While Blomgren notched only 

13 extra-base hits in 2019, he drove 
in 47 runs, which put him only 17 
runs batted in behind the team’s 
leader Jimmy Kerr. Kerr accrued 
31 extra-base hits, but the lack of 
distance between the two players’ 
RBI 
numbers 
suggests 
that 

Blomgren can provide teams with 
clutch hits, a valuable commodity 
for MLB teams.

With Blomgren’s timely hitting 

and 
stellar 
defense 
harking 

back to age-old pillars of a good 
baseball player, combined with his 
propensity to get on base meshing 
with the modern style of the game, 
the Rockies used their fifth round 
pick to select a shortstop built for 
success.

Jordan Nwogu picked 88th by Cubs

The Chicago Cubs used the 

88th overall pick to draft junior 
outfielder Jordan Nwogu Thursday 
night. 

If Nwogu chooses to sign, which 

he plans to, the Cubs’ gain might 
just be bigger than the Wolverines’ 
loss. He capitalized on the 15-game 
sliver of 2020, posting a cumulative 
.353 batting average, .389 on-base 
percentage 
and 
.456 
slugging 

against exclusively NCAA-Regional 
level competition, despite the lack 
of top-of-the-order protection in 
the season’s opening weekends. 

Michigan’s offense ran through 

Nwogu in 2020, and the pressure to 
be ‘the man’ is evident in his metrics. 
His on-base to batting average 
differential is slim, and three steals 
in seven attempts yields an ugly 
percentage. 
His 
aggressiveness 

at the plate and on the basepaths 
showed 
Michigan 
coach 
Erik 

Bakich’s reliance on Nwogu to 
reach base and score. And with the 
rest of the lineup’s struggles to drive 
in or advance Nwogu, Bakich’s 
decision to put all of the chips on an 
extremely capable player in Nwogu 
was understandable. 

As other bats began to heat up 

and the Wolverines started non-
conference play against weaker 
competition, it’s safe to assume 
that Nwogu would have become 
more conservative and efficient 
on the basepaths, similar to his 
improvement 
in 
baserunning 

from last season. In addition to 
experiencing upward trends in 
on-base and slugging percentages, 
he put up a .992 OPS last season 
when he was surrounded by Jordan 
Brewer and Jimmy Kerr.

On defense this season, Nwogu 

was thrust into a starting outfielder 
role due to the departure of Jordon 
Brewer and the injury to Jesse 
Franklin. He handled only 24 

chances in 2019, a small sample size 
to predict future performance, but 
practiced diligently in the offseason 
after being a designated hitter for 
most of 2019. 

“He took a million fly balls out 

there in left field,” Bakich said of his 
offseason.

In 2020, as a result from 

offseason practice, Nwogu handled 
28 errorless chances and led the 
team in outfield assists.

The Wolverines won’t get the 

chance to see just how good Nwogu 
can become in the outfield. That 
privilege belongs to the Cubs, who 
know his offensive floor is high 
and who can help him reach his 
defensive ceiling.

Oakland Athletics select Jeff Criswell with 58th pick of MLB draft

In the second round of the 2020 

MLB Draft Thursday, the Oakland 
Athletics used the 58th pick to select 
junior right-hander Jeff Criswell.

In Criswell, the Athletics gain 

a pitcher who is a proven reliever 
and starter at the collegiate level. 
Criswell established himself as a 
reliever in his freshman season, 
posting a 2.23 earned-run average 
while striking out 32 batters in 32.1 
innings of work, before transitioning 
to the starting rotation prior to the 
2019 season. 

The six-foot-four right-hander 

from Portage, Michigan accrued 
a 7-1 record as a starter, improving 
with each outing, en route to an All-
Big Ten First Team selection. In the 
midst of the Wolverines’ postseason 
run last season, Bakich retained 
the confidence to stick Criswell 
back in the bullpen, and Criswell 

showed no letdown after a year 
away from being a reliever, proving 
his versatility.

It is likely, though, that Criswell’s 

development over his three years 
in Ann Arbor leads to the Athletics 
viewing him as a starting pitching 
prospect.

“He was very valuable for us last 

year,” Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
said in a press conference before 
the 2020 season. “He has gone from 
being maybe more of a thrower as 
a freshman, to a true pitcher with 
three-plus pitches, to a guy who’s 
regarded as one of the best amongst 
his peers. We’re glad to have him, 
and we’re sure glad he’s pitching for 
us on Fridays.”

Criswell’s stature provides him 

with the prototypical size that MLB 
organizations look for in potential 
workhorse-type 
arms, 
and 
his 

ability to hold his mid-90’s fastball 
velocity into the later innings 
suggests his strength matches his 

size.

The 
right-hander 
throws 
a 

steadily improving changeup and 
slider along with his plus fastball, 
but his greatest asset, perhaps, lies 
in his head rather than his arm. 
Despite 
his 
extensive 
physical 

development, 
Criswell 
is 
most 

proud of the significant progress he 
has made in his mental game while 
playing for Michigan by staying cool 
in high-pressure situations.

“Just being able to recognize 

where you’re at in the game and 
having that self-awareness is really 
important,” Criswell told The Daily 
after the season. “And it’s a very big 
help for me.”

Regardless 
of 
whether 
the 

Athletics decide to develop Criswell 
as a starter or a reliever, they will 
certainly be counting on him to use 
the same composure that allowed 
him to post a 2.88 career ERA with 
the Wolverines in order to pitch out 
of jams against professional hitters.
