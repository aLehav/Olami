Proceeds from 
benefit festival to 
help fund Detroit 

summer youth camp

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily News Edtior

Campus saw them hit the dab 

with University of Michigan 
football head coach Jim Harbaugh 

on National Signing Day, and 
now they’re coming back to the 
University to give an even bigger 
show. 

Migos, an Atlanta based hip-

hop trio, will perform at Hill 
Auditorium April 13 for Music 
Matters’ annual charity concert, 
according to a statement from 
Music Matters. The group is best 
known for their chart-topping 
hits “Versace” and “Hannah 
Montana” and their viral single 
“Look at My Dab.”

Comprised of rappers Quavo, 

Takeoff and Offset, Migos are 
self-proclaimed 
University 
of 

Michigan football fans, having 
released videos on their Twitter 
account proclaiming their support 
for the Wolverines. Quavo and 
Takeoff were also at the University 
in February for the “Signing of the 
Stars” event, during which the 
two dabbed with Harbaugh and 
former Detroit Tigers manager 
Jim Leyland.

The concert will serve as a part 

of Springfest, a daylong festival 
featuring 
food, 
performance 

and activities for the community 
during the day.

In a statement, Music Matters 

President 
Jibran 
Ahmed, 
a 

Business 
senior, 
said 
Migos’ 

popular acclaim made them the 
perfect fit for this year’s charity 
concert. 

“With Migos becoming an 

international rap icon, we felt

Resolution brought 

to assembly 

Tuesday amends 

election code

By JENNIFER MEER 

Daily Staff Reporter

A new resolution proposed 

at Tuesday’s Central Student 
Government 
meeting 
could 

make write-in candidates during 
elections a thing of the past.

Partially in response to a 

trend in recent years of writing 
in Jim Harbaugh as a candidate 
for various CSG positions, the 
litigation would amend the CSG 
election code so that write-in 
candidates can be screened for 
their prospective positions before 
receiving votes. It would also 
emphasize that disqualified or 
ineligible candidates cannot be 
elected.

Rackham 
student 
Jared 

Ferguson, chair of the CSG rules 
committee and co-author of the 
resolution, said the litigation was 

crafted in response to the recent 
election results. During this year’s 
election, Harbaugh received 215 
votes, and a slate of other write-in 
candidates — like U.S. Sen. Bernie 
Sanders (D-Vt.) and Darth Vader

The code currently says any 

write-in candidates who receive 
votes from at least three separate 
and eligible students and are 
enrolled in the University and 
reside in the college in which 
they are voting will be considered 
viable to fill a vacant position.

Junior D-man 
forgoes senior 

season, inks three-

year pro deal

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
defensive 

corps just got even thinner.

With 
sophomore 
defenseman 

Zach Werenski already out 
the door to the Columbus Blue 
Jackets organization, junior 
defenseman Michael Downing 
is also leaving, forgoing his 
senior 
season. 
Downing 

has agreed with the Florida 
Panthers on a three-year entry 
level contract, he confirmed 
to The Daily on Tuesday 
afternoon.

“I thought it was the best 

decision for me and my hockey 
career,” 
Downing 
said. 
“I 

talked to Red this morning and 
he said he thinks I’m ready to 
go. And I guess we’ll have to see 
what happens.

“Red told me this morning 

that I’m leaving as a man.”

The 
team 
has 
not 
yet 

announced whether Downing 
will be assigned directly to the 
Panthers or to the club’s AHL 
affiliate Portland Pirates.

Downing has been a top 

defenseman 
for 
Michigan 

since his freshman year. In his 
first year, he played with Mac 
Bennett and they formed the 
team’s top pairing.

In his sophomore season, 

he grew a reputation for laying 
down punishing hits and he 
became the team’s spark plug.

“It helps in a lot of facets,” 

said 
junior 
forward 
JT 

Compher 
about 
Downing’s 

hits last season. “You have to 
know when he’s on the ice as a 
forward on the other team. He 
makes them more and more 
hesitant coming through the 
ice. When he throws a big hit, 
it gets the bench going, and 
we rally behind it. They’re 
questionable calls at times, but 
we’re not going to tell him not 
to be physical, because that is 
the way he helps our team.”

University scientists 
find link between 
mental health and 

gender

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Recent 
University 
of 

Michigan 
research 
suggests 

men are more vulnerable to 
long-term 
depression 
than 

women, 
citing 
a 
decreased 

willingness in men to talk about 
mental health issues.

Using data collected by the 

Institute of Social Research 
on 
nearly 
4,000 
nationally 

representative 
participants 

from 1986 to 2011, Dr. Shervin 
Assari, 
psychiatric 
research 

investigator and lead author 
of the recent study, found 
differences 
between 
long-

term stress and subsequent 
depression 
in 
males 
and 

females. This research, Assari 
said, could have implications 
regarding 
the 
way 
mental 

health is stigmatized between 
the two genders.

Assari said his interest in 

studying how groups differ 
in 
vulnerability 
and 
their 

resilience to stress led him to 
pursue the research. He said he 
believes exposure to stress helps 
build resilience to it, but this 
build-up occurs differently in 
people of different backgrounds, 
genders and social groups.

“Historically, most of the 

research looked at or has tried 
to explain group differences 
in health through differential 
exposures, 
meaning 
that 
if 

women are more depressed, it’s 
because they get more stress,” 
Assari said. “If you get a lot of 
exposure, you build resilience. 
It’s not women who might be 
more susceptible to the effect 
of stress on depression; it might 
be men who have high levels of 
stress and be most vulnerable to 
the effect of it.”

Daphne Watkins, associate 

professor of Social Work, said 
oftentimes gendered differences

University 
to test out 
emergency 
alert system

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
Division 
of 

Public Security and Safety 
announced 
Tuesday 

afternoon that it will run a 
test of its emergency alert 
system Thursday at noon. 
The test will be broadcast 
to the Michigan App, U-M 
Gateway 
and 
Division 

of 
Public 
Safety 
and 

Security websites, interior 
building 
digital 
signs, 

Twitter and web feeds. In 
announcement, DPSS said 
they have been working on 
the emergency alert feature 
on the Michigan mobile 
phone app, and hope to gain 
more feedback about the 
app’s effectiveness through 
Thursday’s test.

“It will be an additional 

method 
for 
the 
campus 

community to receive alerts, 
as well as a method for 
individuals 
not 
affiliated 

with the University, such 
as contractors working on 
campus and parents,” the 
University’s statement read.

In 
a 
February 
e-mail 

interview 
with 
The 

Michigan 
Daily, 
DPSS 

spokeswoman Diane Brown 
stressed the importance of 
the emergency alert system 
to notify students of threats 
and emergency reductions 
in staff.

“We strongly encourage 

all students, faculty and 
staff to register to receive 
the text and voice messages 
in 
order 
to 
quickly 
be 

informed of an imminent 
threat,” she wrote.

Couch has been the city 

manager of Bulloch County, 
Georgia for the past 12 years. 
The county has a population of 
more than 69,000 residents and 
is home to Georgia Southern 
University. Under his leadership, 
the county has expanded their 
local airport, improved public 
transportation and increased 
recycling and energy efficiency 
efforts, according to the city’s 
website. Couch holds a master’s 
degree in public administration 
from Georgia State University 
and an undergraduate degree 
from 
Eastern 
Michigan 

University.

Couch, 
along 
with 
other 

candidates, could not be reached 
for immediate comment.

Fetherston is the assistant 

city 
manager 
of 
Asheville, 

North 
Carolina 
and 
former 

deputy city manager of Boulder, 
Colorado. The city of Asheville, 
where 
Fetherston 
currently 

works, prioritizes continuous 
improvement through integrity 

and diversity. According to the 
press release, Fetherston holds 
a law degree from Western 
New England University School 
of Law and an undergraduate 
degree from Trinity College in 
Hartford, Connecticut.

Lazarus has been the public 

works director as well as the 
interim assistant city manager of 
Austin, Texas, as well as director 
of 
engineering 
for 
Newark, 

New Jersey. Currently, Lazarus 
supervises 730 full-time and 
part-time/seasonal 
employees 

as the public works director 
of Austin, Texas, overseeing a 
department that has an annual 
operating budget of $80 million. 
Lazarus holds a master’s degree 
from Johns Hopkins University 
in Baltimore, Maryland and an 
undergraduate degree from the 
U.S. Military Academy in West 
Point, New York.

Sigman 
is 
the 
city 

administrator 
of 
Hamilton 

County, 
Ohio 
and 
former 

budgeting director in Cincinnati 
and the District of Columbia. 
During 
his 
time 
as 
city 

administrator 
of 
Hamilton 

County, he prepared balanced 

budgets in economic troubles 
that resulted in the loss of 
one-third 
of 
the 
county’s 

workforce. He holds a master’s 
degree in public administration 
from Indiana University and 
undergraduate degree also from 
Indiana University.

The final four candidates were 

identified by a headhunting firm 
contracted by the city. A series 
of hiring interviews will now be 
carried out by city staff through 
mid-April, and the City Council 
will publicly interview them 
on April 16 using procedures 
agreed upon by the council’s 
administration committee.

The search process began in 

October 2015 when the council 
voted to raise the position’s 
salary from $160,000 per year 
to $175,000 after a professional 
search 
firm 
concluded 
the 

average 
annual 
salary 
for 

administrators of similarly sized 
cities is $167,000.

During his exit in 2015, Powers 

told the council he wishes for his 
successor to continue to uphold 
the values of the city.

“An administrator needs to 

view the city as more than just 
police and fire,” Powers said. “It 
is a community that has values 
that are very important to a 
council and the administrator 
is expected to believe in an 
organization that is consistent 
with those values.”

change, when a write-in candidate 
wins a position but is deemed 
ineligible, everyone else running 
would be shifted up a spot.

“The second thing we do, 

which I’m now going to call the 
Jim Harbaugh rule, since it’s what 
happened, when the candidate 
is disqualified the seat is not left 
vacant,” Ferguson said. “Instead, it 
would shift everyone else up.”

He explained that in the past this 

procedure was done regarding the 
executive ticket; when the leaders 
were disqualified, the runners up 
would take the position.

“In Rackham, Jim Harbaugh 

placed seventh — he gets a seat, 
but 
he 
doesn’t 
because 
he’s 

disqualified, which would make 
that person who’s in eighth place 
become seventh and so on and so 
forth down the line,” Ferguson 
said.

Resolutions
Also at Tuesday’s meeting, 

the body passed three pieces 
of legislation including one to 
financially support the University’s 
first Mental Health Day, one 
removing party affiliation from 
candidates for the University of 
Michigan 
Police 
Department 

Oversight Committee and another 
to mandate identity training for all 
CSG members. CSG also heard a 
presentation about the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Bicentennial. 

Additionally, three new resolutions 
regarding the CSG election code 
and its operating procedures were 
brought to the floor.

After some debate, the assembly 

passed 
legislation 
stipulating 

that candidates for the UMPD 
Oversight Commission are not to 
run with political parties. Students 
hold two spots on the commission, 
one elected each CSG election. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Jacob 

Pearlman, one of the co-authors 
of the resolution, responded to 
opposition by saying that though 
political parties provide a necessary 
platform for the representatives to 
show their own qualifications and 
alignments, the UMPD position is 
not political in nature.

“This is not a political position,” 

he said. “There is really nothing 
that you would advocate for to 

obtain this position besides being a 
competent, well-versed individual 
with the community. The person 
that 
is 
running 
for 
UMPD 

Oversight board member should 
be removed from discussion about 
funding, doing this with Maize 
Rage, or whatever the platforms 
are. They have nothing to do with 
any of that.”

One of the two other resolutions 

to 
pass 
unanimously 
was 
a 

resolution approving the financial 
sponsoring by CSG for the first 
Mental Health Day. CSG will now 
partner with student organizations 
and the LSA Student Government, 
among others, to host the event on 
Oct. 10.

LSA 
sophomore 
Nicholas 

Meier, LSA-SG representative and 
co-author of the resolution, said 
his goal in partnering with CSG is 
to raise awareness about mental 
health resources on campus.

“CAPS is great, but there are a 

bunch of other things on campus 
that not enough students know 
about,” he said “Through this, we 
hope to advocate for their resources 
that they have here.”

The event will consist of tables 

set up both in the Diag and on 
North Campus to promote those 
resources.

Guest Speaker
The meeting’s guest speaker 

Bailey 
Oland, 
administrative 

assistant senior of the University’s 
Bicentennial Office, gave a brief 
presentation 
regarding 
the 

importance of student awareness 
and involvement in Bicentennial 
festivities.

The 
Bicentennial 
Office 

coordinates 
and 
encourages 

Bicentennial-related events across 
campus, particularly by student 
organizations.

Oland 
said 
student 
voice 

should factor into the decisions 
surrounding the event because 
they are the most important part of 
the University’s 200-year history.

“Without students we don’t 

have a University. It’s a plain and 
simple fact,” Oland said. “You are 
our biggest constituent for the 
Bicentennial. We talk a lot about 
the future impact of the University. 
If we don’t know what students 
want and what students are 
interested in... then future students 
may not be interested and we can’t 
move forward.”

Zach 
Werenski: 

“Someone who can hit like that 
definitely brings energy to the 
bench. You can see guys on the 
other team don’t want to go his 
way.”

Downing’s 
junior 
season 

was no different. On top of 
his 
continued 
massive 
hits, 

he became a focal point of the 
offense. He led the second power 
play unit, and he had an uncanny 

ability to get his shots through 
traffic and toward the net, which 
often led to goals.

The junior finished the season 

with three goals and 17 assists 
and was one of two defensemen 
to reach 20 points.

Now, Downing is eager to get 

his professional career started.

prove myself to my coaches 
and teammate,” Downing said. 
“There’s a lot to prove and do go 
in there and do what I do and gain 
the respect of my teammates.”

affect the availability of mental 
health information for men.

“I find that the majority of 

research on stress and health 
has 
focused 
primarily 
on 

women,” Watkins said. “I think 
it does negate the importance 
of understanding the ways 
in which stress differentially 
affects men’s health, especially 
vulnerable groups of men and 
boys.”

Assari’s study found over 

time women adapt to stress 
in ways men do not. He said 
women are better able to 
manage their stress, while he 
also noted that men experience 
depression 
at 
higher 
rates 

due to a number of factors 
inclduing 
inability 
to 
deal 

with stress, while women are 
exposed to higher levels of 
stress at a younger age than 
men, levels of depression in 
men are delayed. Yet women 
are more prepared than men 
to manage their stress and 
depressive symptoms, and are 
more likely to seek help.

“The literature says yes, 

women get more stress,” Assari 
said. “But, from the other side, 
we know that women get used 
to stress in the way that they 
can mobilize the psycho-social 
resources. They can better 
communicate or talk about 
their emotions. They don’t 
stigmatize using health care 
… As men, we think that’s not 
appropriate, that reduces our 
power or control over life. We 
don’t talk about our emotions 
and our difficulties.”

Watkins 
said 
long-term 

stress can lead to a range 
of health outcomes, such as 
more severe problems with 
mental health, susceptibility 
to diseases and risk of chronic 
conditions.

“Stress can be detrimental 

to 
everyone’s 
health 
and 

well-being,” 
Watkins 
said. 

“Its effects on health are 
evident, directly through more 
physiological 
pathways, 
but 

also indirectly through health 
behaviors and practices.”

In particular, Assari said 

hegemonic masculinity — a 
traditional belief among men 
that identifies being a man as 
needing to show power and 
dominance can lead to showing 
higher vulnerability to higher 
effects of stress because they 
do not seek professional help. 

Expressing 
a 
similar 

sentiment, Watkins said men 
usually abide by the general 
social 
codes 
set 
for 
their 

gender so as to avoid the 
stress associated with doing 
otherwise.

“Because men tend to adhere 

to 
those 
more 
traditional 

definitions of manhood they 
won’t go and seek physical 
health care or mental health 
care because, despite all these 
risks, they’re saying, ‘I’m the 
man, and because I’m a man, 
I can handle that,’ ” Watkins 
said.

Jill Becker, professor of 

Psychology 
and 
Psychiatry, 

who studies sex differences 
in motivation and drug abuse 
primarily using rat models, 
said the study was a needed 
contribution 
to 
the 
field. 

Becker said when subjecting 
the rats to restraint stressors 
repeatedly for a long period of 
time, female rats show better 
capabilities for learning, while 
male rats do worse following 
repeated 
restraint 
stress. 

Becker said this concept could 
be applicable to human males 
as well. 

“The ability to use these 

large data sets to begin to 
answer questions about where 
are there sex and gender 
differences in how stress is 
affecting us makes this a very 
important article,” Becker said.

For Assari, this research 

ultimately suggests men are 
less likely to take care of their 
emotional problems, an issue 
that could have adverse effects 
on mental and physical health 
in their future.

“We need to work with 

this 
gender 
identity, 
help 

them to seek care, reduce 
stigma associated with mental 
health care organizations and 
(increase) 
communication 

about emotion among men,” 
Assari said.

UHS tests 
artificial heart 
technology

The University of Michigan 

Health System is testing the 
Transmedics Organ Care System 
(OCS), a high-tech heart box that 
circulates blood from the donor 
to the heart, according to the 
University Health System. The 
OCS Heart system will nourish 
the heart with oxygen and 
nutrients and keep it at normal 
body temperature. The current 
method of storing the heart on 
ice keeps it viable for only four 
hours . This new technology aims 
to keep the heart beating while in 
transit.

“With this method of 

transplantation, hearts are kept 
beating, allowing for organs to 
be transplanted longer distances 
so that more opportunities 
may arise for our patients 
to receive the organs they 
desperately need,” said Francis 
Pagani, cardiac surgeon at the 
University of Michigan Frankel 
Cardiovascular Center, the 
study’s lead investigator

According to UHS, there 

are about 4,000 people in the 
United States in need o f a heart 
transplant. This new technology 
will allow many more donor 
hearts to be transplanted because 
hearts can travel longer distances, 
allowing for more potential 
recipients. Also, surgeons will be 
able to examine the heart because 
it is kept functional during 
transportation. 

Flint lags in 
water plan to fix 
infrastructure

The Fast Start program, a 

30-day initiative to replace 
infrastructure at 30 homes by the 
March 31, is far from completion, 
according to MLive. So far, 
less than 10 homes have been 
completed. 

In early March, engineer teams 

identified the 30 priority homes. 
Part of the project includes the 
removal of pipes made of lead and 
galvanized steel. Flint officials 
have attributed the delayed 
progress to rain, snowstorms and 
paperwork issues. 

Weaver’s spokeswoman Kristin 

Moore said they will continue 
infrastructure replacement even 
after the date passes. There are 
potentially 5,000 homes in Flint 
in need of new infrastructure. 
Currently the program is funded 
by the $2 million the state gave to 
reimburse Flint’s expenditures in 
2015 when the city had to switch 
back to the Detroit water system. 
Weaver said she is looking for 
more funding to continue the 
project. 

Detroit Public 
School official 
charged for bribery

The principal of a Detroit 

Public School that was set to 
receive more than $500,000 
worth of donations from TV 
talk show host Ellen DeGeneres 
has been charged with bribery 
in an unrelated criminal case, 
according to the Detroit Free 
Press. 

Federal court records show 

that Ronald Alexander, the 
principal at Charles L. Spain 
Elementary Middle School, 
allegedly appropriated $23,000 
in kickbacks from Norman Shy, in 
exchange for using Shy’s company 
Allstate Sales as a school supply 
vendor. Allstate Sales sells 
school supplies and items such as 
auditorium chairs. 

This is part of a larger saga 

involving $1 million worth 
of kickbacks and at least 12 
Detroit Public Schools that 
contracted Allstate Sales in 
exchange for money. Charles L. 
Elementary Middle School gained 
prominence when DeGeneres 
announced, in a show segment 
that aired in February, that the 
school would receive more than 
$500,000 worth of donations, 
construction materials and 
technology.

T

here is something I’ve been meaning 
to tell you for a while now, and I’m 
not sure how you’ll take it, so I’m just 

gonna come right out and 
say it. I know we’ve been 
practically inseparable all 
these years, so I hope you 
can understand that now 
just feels like the right time 
to finally call it quits once 
and for all.

Your loyalty is admirable. 

No, really. Your presence has 
outlasted even my closest 
friendships (though, to be 
fair, I think you may have 
had something to do with 
that).

I still remember when I met you in sixth 

grade. At the time, I thought you were just 
a passing acquaintance (after all, how many 
12-year-olds can say they have a friend like you?), 
but your company was so persistent, I couldn’t 
help but accept that we would be together for a 
long time. Now, I couldn’t imagine having grown 
up without you.

You’ve accompanied me through all the major 

milestones. Remember when I switched schools 
after freshman year and you followed me to my 
new one? We spent that first day together as I ate 
lunch alone, and you told me I would never make 
friends there. That was true for a while, because 
whenever people reached out, you assured me 
that they were just being nice and didn’t really 
want to hang out with me. I appreciated your 
pragmatism at that critical point in my life — I 
would have mistakenly believed that my friends 
genuinely liked me if it weren’t for you.

Senior year, I was so excited when we got 

into the same college, and even more so when I 
found out we would be rooming together. Our 
interests were so similar, we joined all of the 
same organizations, though you were a little less 
outgoing than I was. After every club meeting, no 
matter how well it went or how many friends I 
made, you would warn me that no one there was 
really interested in what I had to say, and I would 
believe you. I’m glad I stuck with it despite your 

advice, because most of the time, being involved 
gave me a nice little break from your company.

Oh, and when I got a boyfriend here, you were 

so jealous! I know it’s just because you missed 
spending time with me, but rest assured that 
every minute I spent without him, I spent with 
you. Sometimes I couldn’t even enjoy my time 
with him because I was thinking about you too 
often — that’s just how intertwined our lives are, 
I suppose. Funny how that works.

Now that he and I are no longer together, you 

and I have been closer than ever. You attend every 
party with me as my wingman, convincing me to 
drink excessively and hook up with strangers. 
In the morning, you follow me home as I walk 
from their place to mine. You shroud the sunrise 
and make the air piercing cold. You tell me that 
this week, the temperature won’t get above 50 
degrees. In a way, you make it less lonely to be 
alone.

And you know, it’s not often I can say a friend 

of mine really hits it off with my mom, but you’ve 
been there for her, too, just like you were for her 
mom. You’ve even started to work your charm 
on my brother. My dad still isn’t fond of you, and 
admittedly I’m kind of glad. I don’t think you 
guys would have gotten along very well anyway.

I guess what I’m trying to say is although 

you’ve been with me through thick and thin, 
it’s just not working anymore. To be completely 
honest, you’re kind of an asshole, and I think 
I would be just fine without you. I’ve come to 
realize that my friends really do care about me, 
and being actively involved here at the University 
makes me feel more fulfilled than you ever have. 
You only weighed me down, and I often think 
of what I could have accomplished if I weren’t 
spending so much time with you. I know you’ll 
be tempted to reach out, but I would really 
appreciate it if you didn’t contact me. Like, ever. 
I’ll probably be too busy to hang out anyway. 
After all, I have to make up for all those years I 
wasted with you somehow.

Love,
Lauren

W

hat are we meant to do on 
this campus? Why do we 
come to the University of 

Michigan? 
Why 

is this part of our 
lives — our late 
teens and early 
20s — glorified 
in 
movies 
and 

TV shows like 
“The 
Breakfast 

Club,” 
“Animal 

House” and “Blue 
Mountain State” 
and 
considered 

the “best time of 
our lives”?

When I imagine my future self 

assessing the time I have spent and will 
continue to spend in Ann Arbor, I will 
use, as a barometer of success, the level 
to which I experimented, tried new 
things, branched out. Because never 
again in our lives will we be at such a 
place, a place whose very foundation 
rests on the principle of education. 
Well, what does that look like? What 
does an education look like?

I suppose the opposite of using 

our time here to experiment might 
be to settle into a situation that feels 
comfortable, and then to ride that out 
for our entire tenures at Michigan. 
But I would argue that settling into 
such a comfortable situation does not 
promote or even aid our learning; 
instead, a comfortable environment 
inhibits it.

We do not learn in situations that 

are entirely familiar to us; we do not 
learn by surrounding ourselves with 
the same people and inhabiting the 
same spaces every day of the week. 
In these situations, we are not testing 
ourselves. We are not examining who 
we are, what we prefer, our tendencies, 
inclinations, fears, etc. Instead, we 
have settled, we have decided all of 
these things already, or, more likely, 
we have deemed them unworthy of 
further investigation.

Perhaps one reason why our various 

cultural media has deemed college as 
the best time of our lives is precisely 
that: Never again in our lives will a 
situation promote more readily this 
kind of free-flowing experimentation. 
From here, we will be expected to 

begin our career “paths,” and, in just 
a few years, perhaps, to settle down 
with a family, have kids and cease 
experimenting all together. And while 
I myself anticipate something like this 
in my own life — of course, allowing 
for nuance, personalization, etc. — 
what a tragedy it would be to have to 
settle down in this way before fully 
examining who I am, before having 
tried all that has been available to me 
in the years I have been alive.

I do not mean to deride comfort 

entirely — of course, there are 
moments for all of us when we 
want nothing more than to relax, to 
surround ourselves with our best 
friends in our most familiar spaces 
and turn off our minds. I support and 
see the value in this wholeheartedly. 
I just do not think this should be the 
predominant atmosphere that we try 
to carve out for ourselves.

Comfort is relative — in order 

for something to be comfortable, 
there also have to be moments of 
discomfort, 
of 
experimentation. 

Otherwise, 
what 
we 
deem 

comfortable 
eventually 
becomes 

overly familiar and normalized. In 
Charlotte Brontë’s famous novel, 
after returning to her stagnating 
routine at home when she had just 
spontaneously spent a day outside 
on a long walk, Jane Eyre describes, 
“an existence whose very privileges 
of security and ease I was becoming 
incapable of appreciating.” In order 
to appreciate moments of comfort 
and ease, we need to experiment, to 
challenge ourselves, to fully feel and 
acknowledge moments of discomfort.

Life on a college campus allows for 

exploration and experimentation in 
all of their forms: intellectual, social 
— as we are surrounded by tens of 
thousands of bright, engaging minds 
— or, finally, aesthetic, since we live 
in one of the most renowned-for-its-
beauty states in this country?

Throughout my time here, I have 

had plenty of conversations with 
friends where at least one of us is 
expressing visceral contempt for 
some aspect of this university. One of 
us might say, “I hate social life here.” 
Fortunately, though, this statement is 
relatively meaningless because there 

are so many different social lives 
here, all subject to our investigation.

This, I think, is the biggest lesson 

to be learned from studying at such a 
behemoth university as this one: We 
are meant to constantly dig deeper, 
to continue investigating, to find out 
who we are. We are not meant to 
know who we are just yet — I believe 
that is impossible this early on in 
life, since most of us have lived with 
our families for most of our lives. 
Without different experiences and 
experiments, we will never attain a 
full picture of ourselves. Why is it, do 
you think, that playwrights, novelists 
and screenwriters put some of the 
most iconic characters in literature 
through such immense challenges 
(think “Macbeth,” “Madame Bovary” 
or “Invisible Man”)? It is through 
fighting and learning from these 
challenging experiences that these 
characters learn about themselves?

I have learned more about myself 

through scrupulously investigating 
my complex, topsy-turvy relationship 
with this school during the last year 
and a half than in my entire life before 
I got to Ann Arbor. The best moments 
during this time have been those 
when I challenged myself: going into 
a room where I know nobody and 
striking up a conversation or taking 
a class about something I have never 
studied. Through my professors and 
my peers, I began to understand my 
mind and to expand it. I do all of this 
because I believe this is how I will 
measure and assess my time here. 
And, furthermore, I do this knowing 
very well that I have a comfortable 
place to return to, one where I will 
be able to anticipate everything, 
where there will be no disruptions 
to my routine.

Let us explore all that this place, 

this time in our lives, has to offer. 
Let us ask questions of ourselves 
— even ones that feel challenging 
— and attempt to answer them 
through all that this place contains 
and all the layered multitudes that 
we, ourselves, contain.

An incitement to experiment

LAUREN 

SCHANDEVEL

Dear Depression

Since the 1973 decision of Roe v. 

Wade — the controversial Supreme 
Court case over abortion rights — 
women have had the right to choose 
what happens to their bodies in 
regard to unwanted pregnancies. 
However, legalizing abortion was 
not the only significant milestone 
this case promoted. This ruling 
revolutionized the health care 
system for women, paving the 
way for more accepting and less 
stigmatized 
views 
of 
women’s 

health and placing a continued 
emphasis on autonomy in such 
choices.

Prior 
to 
this 
case, 
women 

who wanted to get an abortion 
often 
pursued 
very 
expensive 

and 
dangerous 
procedures 
by 

backstreet providers who were 
often not medically trained. One 
study estimates between 200,000 
and 1.2 million illegal abortions 
were completed per year from the 
1950s to 1960s. The same study 
cites abortions as the official cause 
of death for one-fifth of maternity-
related deaths in 1930. Though 
the legal status of abortions has 
changed since the 1930s, even 
now, decades after Roe v. Wade, 
advocates have to fight to keep the 
right of women’s safety a priority 
for lawmakers.

The Supreme Court has begun 

preparations to make a ruling on 
the legality of a Texas law passed 
in 
2013 
that 
places 
stringent 

regulations on abortion clinics. 
The ruling is expected to take place 
sometime in June. The Court’s 
decision could alter the ways in 
which abortion is viewed and 
carried out in not only Texas, but 
also in other states that choose to 
adopt this law. The law requires 
physicians 
to 
have 
admitting 

privileges, or the capability of 
placing and treating a patient in a 
hospital. The law would require 
such a hospital to be within 30 
miles of the clinic. The law would 

increase 
requirements 
for 
the 

buildings housing the clinics, such 
as expanding the width of hallways 
and adding showers and lockers in 
certain areas. Adhering to these 
requirements could end up costing 
millions of dollars. Such measures 
would assess clinics on similar 
standards to the ways in which 
surgical centers are assessed. These 
requirements would be enforced 
even if the clinic does not offer 
surgical abortions, instead inducing 
abortions by medication, making 
the requirements unnecessary and 
excessive.

Supporters of these regulations 

claim they will prevent unnecessary 
health risks to women who seek an 
abortion. However, continuation 
of this law could have detrimental 
effects 
for 
women 
seeking 

abortions in the coming years. 
Many advocates for this law are 
pro-life supporters who are simply 
aiming to severely limit the right a 
woman has to choose to terminate a 
pregnancy. Coercive action, which 
is often used to place increased 
pressure on women to not go 
through with an abortion, is already 
mandated by laws not only in Texas, 
but across the country. Women 
are consistently discouraged from 
making the personal choice to go 
through with an abortion. Fourteen 
states require women to attend 
two separate appointments, which 
often use unnecessary ultrasounds 
and other scare tactics to place 
doubt in the choice to terminate the 
pregnancy, before being authorized 
to receive an abortion. These 
appointments are often aimed to 
place doubt in the choice to end a 
pregnancy. 

Reports 
have 
indicated 
that 

sections of the Texas law that are 
already in place have decreased the 
number of clinics legally authorized 
to offer abortions from 41 to 19. If 
the law is upheld after the Supreme 
Court decision, the number of 

clinics open could drop to only 10 
statewide to service a population 
of 27,469,114. Such a dramatic 
decrease 
in 
the 
opportunities 

women have to get an abortion will 
likely have negative effects.

Those who are not willing or able 

to travel the increased distance to a 
state-approved abortion clinic may 
find more dangerous, black-market 
alternatives to end a pregnancy. 
Some in Southern Texas would 
potentially have to make a 150-mile 
journey to make it to the nearest 
abortion clinic. Without a ride to 
get to such a faraway place, enough 
money to stay or return to the area 
for two visits, and no insurance 
to cover the cost of the actual 
procedure, attaining the ability 
to exercise the right to have an 
abortion would be impossible.

In these areas where abortions 

are 
especially 
difficult 
to 

accomplish legally, many have 
taken to a medication prescribed 
for ulcers in order to induce a 
miscarriage. The drug, if taken 
properly, is still only 80-to-85-
percent effective and if too much 
is taken, can be fatal. This drug, 
called misoprostol, is actually one 
of the safer nonclinical methods 
used by those who desperately 
seek an abortion if traveling to a 
clinic is out of reach.

It is not unheard of for women 

to go to extreme measures in order 
to give themselves an abortion 
when their access is extremely 
limited. Even in the days after the 
legalization of abortion, women 
feel forced to resort to unsafe 
measures in order to act upon 
their rights to autonomy. If the 
government will not allow women 
to receive an abortion legally and 
in a safe facility in a reasonable 
way, they will find a way to give 
themselves abortions.

Roe v. Wade didn’t solve it all

CAITLIN HEENAN | OP-ED

Throughout my time in college, I’ve learned 

that living independently is mainly an exercise in 
taking mental inventories. Each day, I find myself 
cataloging lists of how many pages of reading I 
have to do by tomorrow, how much money I 
spent the night before and how many hours of 
studying I can get in before my exam if I start 
being productive right that second. List-making 
became a subconscious part of my daily life, but 
as my time as a student comes to a close, I feel my 
lists starting to change. Instead of assignments 
and personal finances, I’ve turned inward, 
and considered how many relationships I have 
ruined while I was drunk, and if what surrounds 
me now is really all I have to show for four years.

In response to these disquieting inventories, 

and driven by the accumulative shame I’ve felt 
when my roommates filled me in on a previous 
night’s belligerent behavior, I started going to 
local Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. The 
only previous exposure I’d had to AA was from 
reading David Foster Wallace’s “Infinite Jest,” 
which coincidentally I read during a five-month 
stretch when I lived at home, at the request of 
my parents, in response to a litany of underage 
drinking tickets. During those five months, I 
attended treatment and was “sober” in the sense 
that I didn’t drink while in my hometown, but 
drank to excess whenever I came to Ann Arbor 
to visit my now-ex-girlfriend.

After attending a few meetings, I was 

surprised at how exactly spot-on Wallace was 
when he wrote about AA. All the clichés are 
there: free coffee in little Styrofoam cups, chain 
smokers and old blue-collar guys who have been 
sober for 10-plus years but still keep coming to 
meetings. Wallace calls these gentlemen “the 
crocodiles” on account of their weathered and 
scaly faces from years of hitting the bottle and 
subsequent years of smoking cigarettes outside of 
AA meetings. The first time I went to a meeting, 
I was met with pithy nuggets of wisdom that 
scared me when I realized how closely they hit 
home — “It’s the ants that make us drink, not the 
elephants.”

I haven’t experienced any great tragedy 

like some of my more experienced AA fellows, 
and I don’t have any felonies that mandate my 
attendance to meetings, but I go nonetheless. 
Most of the time, I feel like I don’t belong, and I 
know it’s because I have a stockpile of excuses 
and rationalizations for not accepting my 
drinking as alcoholism.

In the spirit of making lists, here are some 

of the most popular: I work a shit job on top of 
a brutal class schedule, it’s my senior year and 
I should be having fun, and other people drink 
way more than me and are fine. I can’t escape this 
feeling that sobriety is somehow wrong for me. 

The classic AA big-book response to this sort of 
backsliding is that a lifetime without drinking is 
such an overwhelming thought that it will defeat 
even the most dedicated seeker of sobriety. This 
fear is what inspired the central tenet of AA, that 
sobriety is maintained one day at a time. But even 
this outlook, which in many ways is the be-all 
and end-all of AA, doesn’t make the thought of 
sobriety any less terrifying.

Each day I add to my list of sober days feels 

more like a brick than an accomplishment, 
and I feel these bricks stacking up precariously 
higher with each passing day. I’m tempted to 
just take a drink and throw it all away, because 
it makes rational sense that the collapse of 30 
bricks would be much less damaging than the 
collapse of 90 or 365. This pseudo-rationality is 
how I’ve gone about my entire college career. I’ve 
tried to justify my destructive relationship with 
alcohol by saying to myself that I’m just a normal 
college binge drinker, that every party needs a 
drunk wild card, or more severely, that I have 
an emptiness inside me that prevents me from 
feeling happiness without alcohol.

At one of my first meetings, a true crocodile 

approached me at the night’s end and asked me 
when my “Sober Birthday” was — an AA term 
for the date of your last drink. He could tell I 
was new to AA because most, if not all, newly 
sober people at an AA meeting have a familiar 
expression of quiet, doe-eyed apprehension and 
shame. Embarrassed, I told him that it was only 
a few days ago. To my surprise, he smiled and 
explained that it was great, as an old AA veteran, 
to be able to pay forward the help that he received 
back when he was only three days sober. He gave 
me his phone number and told me to call him 
“before the drink, not after.” After the first week 
of attending meetings, I had a new inventory of 
names and faces that shared a common hope 
with me — names and faces that were willing to 
share their wisdom and experiences in a meeting 
or over the phone with a near stranger.

They say in AA that in order to be successful 

and attain sobriety, you have to concede to 
your innermost self that you’ve lost control. I’m 
struggling to take this vital first step; I think 
the current driving force behind my sobriety is 
an abject fear of feeling like a hypocrite, rather 
than a genuine desire to adopt a new way of living 
and shed an old way of dying. Sobriety won’t 
miraculously bring me happiness, and I know I 
may have to try and fail before being successful, 
but I’ll keep attending meetings, and I’ll wait. I’ll 
wait until my stack of bricks assembles into a real 
foundation or collapses on itself.

Unconventional rom-
com ‘Doris’ a success

By ANA LUCENA

Daily Arts Writer

An elderly woman pursu-

ing her hot, younger coworker 
could sound like a straightfor-
ward, 
uncre-

ative 
story, 

but “Hello, My 
Name Is Doris” 
creates an arc 
as much about 
an 
endearing 

woman explor-
ing society as 
it is about her 
lust.

The film is 

about 
Doris 

Miller, a shy 
packrat in her 
late 60s who works at a hipster 
fashion company in New York 
City, played wonderfully by 
Sally 
Field 
(“The 
Amazing 

Spider-Man 2”). She hasn’t had 
much of a chance to live freely 
as she has been dutifully living 
with her mother, a hoarder who 
passes away at the beginning 
of the film. After attending 
a lecture by a motivational 
speaker, Doris is inspired to 
make a change. Right from the 
get-go we see Doris’s internal 
conflict. Her world is turned 
upside down with the timely 
arrival 
of 
new 
handsome 

coworker John Fremont (Max 
Greenfield, “Veronica Mars”). 
After being sensually squished 
together in a cramped elevator 
at work, Doris becomes smitten 
with John.

At first I was concerned she 

would wreak havoc on John’s 
life as she becomes obsessed 
with her love for him, like in the 
2003 French film “He Loves Me 
… He Loves Me Not” that also 
has a plot sparked by a chance 
encounter. Thankfully, Doris’s 
integrity as her own person is 
consistent throughout, keeping 
her from seeming silly as she 
chases a man decades younger 
than her. The way she falls 
in love at first doesn’t feel 
so cliché after knowing her 
restrained past, keeping the 
focus on Doris growing. With 
her tough best friend Roz (Tyne 
Daly, 
“Judging 
Amy”) 
and 

Roz’s granddaughter (Isabella 
Acres, “Sofia the First”) by her 
side, Doris successfully enters 
a friend group of millennial 
coworkers 
who 
appreciate 

her interesting fashion sense. 
These 
millennials 
provide 

much needed insight into the 
younger 
generation 
as 
she 

navigates spending time with 
John. The plot takes dramatic 
turns, 
keeping 
Doris 
from 

feeling wacky. It also grounds 
her in the real struggles of 
reaching old age, making her 
story go beyond the surface 
humor to incorporate striking 
perspectives on aging as well.

Sally Field is completely 

lovable as Doris, one of the 
best elements of the film in 
spite of her eccentricities and 
far-fetched goals. Not even 
her 
addiction 
to 
romance 

novels can make the way she 

tackles her affection for John 
predictable, nor the outcomes 
of her attempts to pursue him. 
Her frequently amazed face 
conveys a delightful optimism 
you would expect to have been 
extinguished by her age. Seeing 
an older woman so resolved to 
enjoying life and loving more 
reminds me of another talented 
actress, Ruth Gordon as Maude 
in “Harold and Maude.” I’m 
happy that Field is able to land 
another stellar role in her long 
career as she nears 70, knowing 
that actresses tend to struggle 
to find leading roles as they age.

Though Field is very funny, 

the humor of the film fell flat at 
times. As Doris makes friends 
with 
young 
adults, 
there 

were jokes about the growing 
reliance on technology and 
the increased visibility of the 
LGBTQ 
community. 
While 

never 
mean-spirited, 
they 

did a poor job of showing the 
difficulty of Doris’s dream to 
get with her young coworker by 
illustrating how wide the age 
gap is between them.

The 
most 
exciting 
thing 

about 
“Hello, 
My 
Name 

Is Doris” is Field’s return 
as a leading lady. The film 
revolving 
around 
Doris 
to 

incorporate its commentary on 
millennials and New York City, 
is successful overall, though 
not overwhelmingly so. But 
with the lead being as comic yet 
realistic as Doris, rooting for 
her is entertaining from start to 
finish.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
SMTD performs 
adapted ‘Invalid’

By KELLY MARTINEK

Daily Arts Writer

The School of Music, Theatre 

& Dance’s Department of Theatre 
& Drama will close their 2015-
2016 
season 

in the coming 
weekends with 
a production of 
“The Imaginary 
Invalid,” direct-
ed 
by 
Daniel 

Cantor, associ-
ate professor of 
Theatre, Acting 
and Directing.

“The Imagi-

nary Invalid” is 
a farce written 
by 17th century 
French 
play-

wright Molière, 
one 
of 
the 

“iconic playwrights of the West-
ern canon,” according to Cantor. 
The play tells the story of Argan, 
a severe, albeit fiscally cheap, 
hypochondriac who devises a 
plan to receive free healthcare 
by marrying his daughter off to 
a doctor.

SMTD will be performing a 

1999 translation and adaptation 
of the piece by James Magruder 
for the Yale Repertory Theater. 
Since 
Magruder’s 
adaptation 

includes musical interludes that 
reference New Haven, Connecti-
cut and other specific references 
to the Yale Repertory Theatre, 

Cantor and his team got permis-
sion to change those references 
to pertain to their production on 
campus.

Cantor has 30 years of profes-

sional theatre experience under 
his belt, both acting and direct-
ing. He has chosen to set this pro-
duction in the period of the Belle 
Époque, between 1890 and 1900, 
instead of the 17th century, in 
which it was originally written.

“Based on my interpretation of 

the themes in the play, it encour-
aged me to set it in this period,” 
Cantor said. “This period has a 
particular kind of aesthetic, so the 
set, costumes, the music are all 
influenced by that period and that 
aesthetic.”

To create the aesthetic, Can-

tor has the help of an artistic team 
made up of both undergraduate 
students and faculty. According to 
a press release, the show’s lighting 
designer is School of Music, The-
atre & Dance junior Abbey Koji-
ma and the costume designer is 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior Lindsay Balaka. Both are 
BFA design & production majors 
in the Department of Theatre & 
Drama. Vincent Mountain, associ-
ate Professor of Theatre & Drama 
Vincent Mountain is the play’s 
scenic designer. The sound design 
is by School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance and Business senior Billy 
Cedar with music direction by 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior Alex Bonoff.

After the performance on Fri-

day, there will be a “Curtain Call,” 
a post-performance discussion 
about the play with Cantor and 
members of the cast and produc-
tion team, which will be free and 
open to all.

On stage, the cast is made up of 

18 actors, including an ensemble 
of seven who will sing, dance and 
play instruments during the musi-
cal interludes throughout the play. 

“It’s a heightened style. It’s 

somewhat broad; it’s pretty fast,” 
Cantor said. “It requires a cer-
tain degree of actors really hav-
ing chops, like having technical, 
mechanical chops to be able to 
perform almost with a kind of 
athleticism, and it’s very physi-
cal, too, so you need physically 
skilled performers. So it requires 
a high degree of skill, but like with 
any comedy, there’s the style of it, 
and then inside the style of it you 
still have to be a character who is 
trying to get something and who 
wants something and who really 
feels things.”

The play includes elements of 

true satire and social commentary, 
but most of all, Molière is known 
for his comedy. 

“He’s one of the greatest comic 

writers who ever, ever lived,” Can-
tor said. “So if you do his plays 
well, and hopefully we’ll do them 
well, it is just an absolutely great 
time … I think seeing a really high-
energy, vital, hilarious, smart, fun 
play makes you feel good.”

Evolving Cardiknox

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

“Just another girl from a 

small town with big dreams / 
Just another wild heart who’s 
looking to break free / And the 
locks on the doors only make me 
want more of the crown / In the 
black of the night, there’s a hum 
you can feel in the ground.”

The 
opening 
lyrics 
of 

Cardiknox’s 
breakthrough 

full-length album Portrait set 
the stage for the inventive and 
experimental tracks that follow. 
Breaking free of traditional pop 
guidelines, the New York-based 
electronic pop duo set a new 
precedence of mixing ’80s beats 
with modern pop elements. 
Raised in the suburbs of Seattle 
and 
introduced 
through 
a 

mutual friend, Lonnie Angle’s 
classical piano training and 
Thomas Dutton’s punk roots 
combined to release the synth-
infused Portrait on March 11, 
2016.

Starting off soft and steady, 

“Earthquake” tests out new 
instruments 
and 
electronics 

to find Cardiknox’s voice. As 
Angle’s vocals soar over the 

background 
beats, 
multiple 

layers and echoes make the duo 
sound like a full band. “Doors” 
leads with a cappella and a steady 
drumbeat, slowing things down 
for a vocal showcase. With 
untraditional and catchy hooks, 
the methodical and repetitive 
chorus puts the listener in a 
trancelike state as Angle sings, 
“I cannot be defined by the 
present or the past.”

Channeling The 1975, “Into 

the Night” mutes its intro and 
speaks of regrets and moving 
on. As Angle croons, “Baby, I 
remember everything you forgot 
to say to me / Left me feeling 
blue / I’m thinking that maybe I 
was looking for something that 
could save me / But it wasn’t 
you,” the juxtaposition between 
simple verses and a heavy, ’80s 
inspired chorus is the perfect 
example of the kind of music 
Cardiknox makes.

“Bloodlust” takes on the role 

of an experimental rock song 
with dense electric guitars 
and constant drumsticks. It’s 
seductive 
and 
captivating, 

using quick-witted lyrics like, 
“I see you in my sleep / A vision 
in the heat / I want to see what 

you’ve got,” to draw the listener 
in.

Closing 
with 
piano-based 

“Shadowboxing” gives Angle 
a chance to showcase her 
classical training while still 
adding 
electronic 
elements 

to supplement Dutton’s style. 
The swelling vocals feel like 
an appropriate culmination to 
the edgy and innovative album, 
bringing the listener down 
from the preceding fast-paced 
tracks and providing a chance 
to reflect on the experience. 
The sweet and clear vocals 
talk about fighting off demons 
as Angle sings, “I’m fighting 
someone / But no one’s there 
/ I’m throwing punches into 
the air / I’m shadowboxing.” It 
simultaneously feels nostalgic 
and hopeful and leaves the 
album on a bittersweet note, 
ready for Cardiknox’s next 
project.

“Earthquake’s” closing lyrics 

about sum up Cardiknox’s next 
move when Angle proclaims, 
“And when my feet land on the 
dirt / You’ll feel the ground 
shake / I’m gonna make my 
mark / I’m coming like an 
earthquake.”

UK sex-fueled meta- 
horror comedy ‘Nina’

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

Your exes will haunt you forever 

— literally. In the debut film from 
directing duo brothers Chris and 
Ben 
Blaine, 

“Nina Forever,” 
the 
afterlife 

meets this life 
in the bedroom. 
Emotionally 
haunted by the 
untimely death 
of his girlfriend 
Nina (Fiona O’ 
Shaughnessy 
“Outcast”), Rob 
(Cian 
Berry 

“Help Point”) finds love again 
with his coworker Holly (Abigail 
Hardingham “Sasquatch”). Then 
the emotional haunting becomes 
literal haunting, as Nina returns 
every time the couple tries to have 
sex.

For a horror/romantic drama 

with a whacked-out plot, “Nina 
Forever” is shot beautifully and 
cleverly. Shots of the three leads 
in bed show the messiness of their 
relationship. Holly and Rob are 
always, in some way, obscured by 
Nina. As the two bicker about what 
to do with the corpse in the room, 
the 
classic 
over-the-shoulder 

shot is played with, shooting the 

dialogue over Nina’s shoulders.

The film begins dangerously 

close to Manic Pixie Dream Girl 
territory. 
Holly 
thinks 
Rob’s 

suicidal 
depression 
is 
totally 

hot. The pair first interact in the 
storeroom of the grocery shop 
over a shared pair of headphones. 
Rob is dark and brooding. Holly 
is desperate to show him how 
dangerous and free she can be. 
At first, the looming question in 
“Nina Forever” is “when is Zooey 
Deschanel going to show up?”

But then things get weird and 

it’s great. After the initial horror 
of ghosts not only being real, but 
also watching you have sex sinks 
in, the three fall into a weird, semi-
polyamorous relationship. Oddly 
enough, Nina’s bloodied corpse 
lying on the bed next to them 
doesn’t seem to be a mood-killer.

But what haunts them more 

than Nina’s physical presence is 
the implications it carries. What 
happens when someone you love 
dies? What happens when you try 
to love again?

Through 
attempts 
at 

answering these questions, “Nina 
Forever” 
transcends 
campy 

horror and becomes something 
philosophically charged. While 
it asks more questions than it 
answers, when the film does come 
to terms with the harsh truths of 

love, it soars.

The pair must grapple with 

how to both honor Nina and move 
on from her. Holly gets Nina’s 
name tattooed on her lower back 
(weird) and the pair try having 
sex on Nina’s grave (even weirder). 
There is no real resolution for 
this problem, and that is why 
“Nina Forever” is so wonderful. It 
doesn’t have all the answers and it 
doesn’t pretend to.

While most of the questions 

“Nina 
Forever” 
leaves 

unanswered 
are 
large 
and 

profound, some simple plot points 
are left untouched. There’s quick 
mention of a weird flirtation 
between Rob and Nina’s mom 
and a glazing over of the large 
age gap between Holly, who 
seems to be a college freshman, 
and Rob, who already has a PhD. 
Yes, these aren’t the questions 
“Nina Forever” wants to spend its 
time answering, but why further 
complicate an already twisted 
plot?

The elevator pitch of “Nina 

Forever” 
could 
easily 
sound 

like another sex-fueled horror-
comedy of the post-“Scream” era. 
But because it chooses to wrestle 
with the hard questions that 
underlie any film in this genre, 
it becomes something beautiful, 
heartbreaking and wholly its own.

s far back as I can

wanted 
to 
be 
a

I read a few comics, but mostly 
I 
played 

superhero

watched 
cartoons 
(my 
favorites 
were 
“Batman:

and the 1994 “Spider-Man”). 
With my boundless imagination 
extrapolated 
into 
reality, 
I 

believed it was possible to 
receive 
superpowers. 
When 

I was seven or eight I was at a 
playground and saw what was 
probably a small mosquito bite 
on my wrist, but managed to 
convince myself that it was, in 
fact, a bite from a radioactive 
spider. It would only be a matter 
of minutes, I thought, until I 
collapsed from exhaustion as 
the new spider DNA worked 
itself into my own, and I would 
be reborn as the wall-crawler 
himself. 
I 
was 
incredibly 

disappointed when this did not 
happen.

Under Armour dri-fit T-shirts 
(Superman and The Punisher, if 
you were curious), and when I 
wear them I feel just a little bit 
stronger and more powerful. 
But that’s about as close as I can 
get to realizing my superhero 
dreams. Anything more must 
be lived vicariously through 
the 
never-ending 
string 
of 

superhero 
movies 
that 
get 

pumped out each year. 

I’m hooked on this genre, 

along with a huge proportion 
of American filmgoers. I saw a 
Rolling Stone article the other 
day titled “How Superhero 
Movies Became Too Big to Fail,” 
and, though I did not read the 
article given this publication’s 
track 
record 
of 
embodying 

the worst parts of pop culture 
journalism, the headline is not 
wrong. This genre is so safe 
because the sizeable population 
of people like me will continue 
to throw gobs of money at it, 
regardless of the quality of the 
product.

“Batman 
v 
Superman” 

represents the pinnacle (or 
perhaps the nadir, depending 
on 
one’s 
perspective) 
of 

the superhero event movie 
phenomenon. This movie was 
universally panned and still 
made $166 million at the box 
office in one weekend. Hell, I 
read some 10 negative reviews 
and had three different friends 
and my brother tell me to save 
my money, and I still went. I am 
a slave to this genre.

And it is of course that 

very devotion to the idea of 
superhero 
films 
that 
will 

continue to generate mishaps 
like “Batman v Superman.” 
If there’s a profit to be made, 
then studios will simply throw 
together 
a 
half-thought-out 

story, give it a gimmicky little 
title and proceed to rip my heart 
out with its shoddy content.

But for as much as I disliked 

“Batman v Superman,” one 
scene in particular stood out 
to me: the day “the world is 
introduced to the Superman,” 
the fight between Superman 
and General Zod that took 
place during “Man of Steel.” 
This 
first 
action 
sequence 

finds Bruce Wayne, clad in 
his pleated pants, vest and 
tie, 
frantically 
traversing 

downtown Metropolis as the 
city collapses around him in an 
attempt to save his friends at 
Wayne Enterprises. With the 
events of Brussels still fresh in 
my mind, I could not help but 
view the scene as a parable of 
urban terrorism.

I’ve read a lot of criticism 

of this franchise because it 
attempts to ask the question: 
what would happen in a world 
where the Superman existed? 
These critics say a comic book 
movie is escapism and shouldn’t 
attempt to portray our world. 
While I find this assessment 
fair, it deprives us of a very 
captivating potential cinematic 
experience. 
This 
opening 

sequence 
very 
effectively 

captures the complete horror 
of the spectators of a cosmic 
death match, who peer up from 
the streets and catch two small 
figures wreaking havoc on our 
world. This scene, at least, is a 
superhero movie for a post-9/11 
world, a world embroiled in 
seemingly never-ending terror.

While the rest of “Batman 

v Superman” falls decidedly 
flat, this one scene possesses 
incredible power. Cartoonish 
fun and zany characters in 
“Ant-Man” and “Guardians of 
the Galaxy” can be enjoyable, 
and in fact I liked them very 
much, but they do not resonate 
on a more visceral level in the 

same way that this opening 
sequence did.

The only other superhero 

film that accomplished this 
same visceral experience that 
I’ve seen is “Captain America: 
The 
Winter 
Soldier.” 
This 

was less a superhero film, 
more 
an 
espionage 
thriller 

that happened to star Captain 
America, and it offered an 
overt metaphor for surveillance 
in the age of terror. Replace 
SHIELD with the NSA and 
replace hovering warships with 
surveillance 
programs 
and 

the result is, essentially, the 
modern world. This compelling 
take on the balance between 
liberty and security is and 
will continue to be relevant 
for years — the recent Apple v. 
FBI showdown was yet another 
example of the issue.

Like 
the 
Western 
genre 

before them, superhero movies 
have become so pervasive that 
to simply see another good 
guy-bad guy showdown with 
explosions, or (god forbid) 
another origin story, wastes the 
very rich superhero framework 
that raises thought-provoking 
questions 
relevant 
to 
our 

world. Superheroes are not 
simple characters; often their 
motivations are ill founded, 
their actions are suspect and 
the 
consequences 
of 
those 

actions can be quite profound. 
To relegate them to the basic 
good guy framework flounders 
the potential to tell a modern 
cinematic allegory.

I believe this is the direction 

to which superhero movies are 
starting to turn. The superhero 
movie as a closed-off comic 
book film (and the pulp and 
tone that the medium offers) 
was perfected by “Spiderman 
2” and “Sin City,” and has since 
been run into the ground. This 
next series of superhero films 
will fall more in line with 
“Captain America 2” and the 
first “Iron Man” in that they 
can be fun but also tackle and 
reflect our real world.

I 
know 
some 
will 
find 

this disappointing: as I said 
above 
many 
believe 
that 

superhero 
films 
are 
peak 

escapist 
entertainment. 
But 

entertainment 
should 
not 

mean 
unchallenging 
and 

unintelligent, nor should it 
mean naïve and ignorant. The 
best superhero film will have 
something to say and will 
execute its message strongly, 
while offering a compelling 
cinematic experience.

This is the most important 

lesson of “Batman v Superman,” 
a film that had something to say 
but couldn’t execute its message 
or provide the entertaining 
experience. It takes a strong 
creative mind to balance these 
many aspects — not a director 
with an eye for visual flair — 
and studios would be wise not 
push out these minds in favor of 
a quick buck.

Because though I enjoyed the 

eight-minute short film tucked 
into “Batman v Superman,” my 
blind devotion to the genre has 
its limits.

‘Vogue’ a pop flop

By SHIMA SADAGHIYANI

Daily Arts Writer

You would expect that an 

album titled More Issues Than 
Vogue would vaguely resem-
ble 
Britney 

Spears in the 
early 
2000s: 

fun, 
spon-

taneous 
and 

fucking wild. 
Instead, 
K. 

Michelle’s lat-
est 
12-track 

album vague-
ly 
resembles 

the terrain of Kansas: flat, 
repetitive and prone to causing 
drowsiness.

K. 
Michelle 
begins 
her 

album with a trap; “Mindful” 
is upbeat, fast-paced, entertain-
ing and completely different 
from the other sluggish songs 
on More Issues Than Vogue. 
The contrast between “Mind-
ful” and the rest of the album is 
discerning at best and brings an 
unfinished, unconnected qual-
ity to the album as a whole. 

Nonetheless, it’s not that 

the songs themselves are bad. 
On the contrary, K. Michelle’s 
voice brings a very Adele-esque 
quality to classic R&B beats, 
creating soothing, girl-positive, 
power ballads. For example, 
“Ain’t You” has an organic, hazy 
rhythm layered well under-
neath lyrics like “Oh, I got 
my own shit, don’t want your 
money / Nope, I drop a hundred 
bands like it’s easy money.” K. 
Michelle’s honey-sweet voice 
makes you think she’s blowing a 
kiss when she’s really swinging 

a punch, which, when paired 
with the minimalist beat, pro-
duces the perfect amount of 
likeable “fuck you.” The same 
persona is seen in “Night-
stand.” K. Michelle proudly 
croons “just being honest I 
promise that jewelry you gave 
me / I never even wear it and 
I like Drake better than you.” 
Throughout More Issues Than 
Vogue, K. Michelle is unapolo-
getically both a powerful singer 
and a powerful woman, creating 
compositions that are simulta-
neously sensual and centered 
around female empowerment. 

However, there is no differen-

tiation between different songs’ 
tempos, styles and rhythms. 
More Issues Than Vogue, when 
listened through start to finish, 
seems to be one behemoth song 
instead of a conglomeration of 
varying songs paired together in 
complementary ways. A major-
ity of the album is structured the 
same way: a steady beat in the 
background supplementing K. 
Michelle’s soaring vocals. And 
while the individual songs are 
beautifully crafted, they are all 
beautifully crafted in the exact 
same way, resulting in a monoto-
nous album that has no zing or 
any level of excitement. 

For example, from “Ain’t You” 

to “If It Ain’t Love” or from 
“Nightstand” to “Time,” are 
stretches of time in the album 
where the songs are so similar 
they all blend together to the 
point where you don’t know 
where one song ends and the 
other song begins. Accompany 
this unclear and uncertain dis-
cernment between songs with 

a painfully slow tempo, and 
you get music to fall asleep to 
(or music you wish you were 
asleep to avoid listening to). 
K. Michelle, take a page out of 
Missy Elliott’s book and get ur 
freak on.

The only two songs from 

More Issues Than Vogue that 
stray from the dreary norm are 
“Rich” and “Make The Bed.” 
With the help of both Trina and 
Yo Gotti, K. Michelle upped her 
game in “Rich” and produced 
an attention-grabbing song that 
stood out from its sea of sur-
rounding tedium. Although “I 
got rich people problems / only 
way to solve ‘em / keep on get-
tin’ rich” is a bit unoriginal, it 
at least provides some variation 
that stops the album from truly 
becoming the epitome of lack-
luster. With the help of Jason 
Derulo, K. Michelle finally 
increases the speed of the dying 
tempo in “Make The Bed” as 
she asks the age-old question 
of “why do we, why do we, why 
do we / make the bed?” By the 
end of the song, she still hasn’t 
found the answer, but at least 
we, as listeners, are revived and 
energized enough to make it to 
the end of the album.

Overall, K. Michelle is an 

amazing singer with a monu-
mental voice, but she doesn’t 
push her potential or her tal-
ents. Instead, she stays well 
within her comfort zone. While 
that ensures she doesn’t make 
any truly horrible songs, it also 
results in products like More 
Issues Than Vogue — an album 
uninspiring and unremarkable 
in its uniformity.

Berenson in no rush to decide future

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan hockey team’s 

season ended in Cincinnati 
on Saturday with a 5-2 loss to 
North Dakota in the regional 
final of the NCAA Tournament. 

At his first media availability 

since that loss, Michigan coach 
Red Berenson predicted which 
rising seniors he could see 
having breakout seasons in 
2016. And he discussed how the 
power play unit would adjust 
next year after losing its point 
man — sophomore defenseman 
Zach Werenski — to the NHL.

The focus on what lies ahead 

for the Wolverines made some 
wonder whether Berenson was 
leaning toward returning for 
another year with the program. 

He quickly dispelled that 

notion, though.

“(Talking about next year), 

that’s what I do,” Berenson said. 
“This week is a week of losing 
players and trying to fit together 
our group for next year. We’re 
talking about spring term and 
that’s what I have to do. I have 
to help plan what’s going on.

“Then, 
at 
some 
point, 

I’ll have meetings with my 
administration and we’ll talk 
about whether I’m going to be 
here or not. But we definitely 
have a plan (for next year). 
We’re not going to just walk 
away and take the keys with us.”

As for the timeframe for his 

decision, Berenson expects he 
will reach a consensus with 
Michigan 
Athletic 
Director 

Warde Manuel well before the 
end of June.

Berenson 
plans 
to 
meet 

with Manuel within the next 
few days to have an in-depth 
conversation about his future, 
before taking some time to 
make a final decision.

“I want to let the smoke clear 

a little bit from this season,” 

Berenson said. “I don’t want 
to make an emotional decision 
because 
I’m 
pissed 
off 
at 

somebody or something. I want 
to 
make 
a 

decision that’s 
good for the 
program.”

Berenson 

did 
admit 

that attrition 
could 
sway 

his 
decision, 

though.

He 
has 

already 
lost 

Werenski and 
junior 
defenseman 
Michael 

Downing to the Columbus Blue 
Jackets and Florida Panthers, 
respectively. And it’s unclear 
what freshman forward Kyle 
Connor will decide regarding 

his professional future with the 
Winnipeg Jets — who drafted 
him 17th overall in the NHL 
draft last summer.

But 
none 

among 
that 

group 
could 

swing 
the 

pendulum 
of 

Berenson’s 
decision 
to 

return 
to 

Michigan. 
Two 
players 

who 
could 

sway 
Berenson, 

though, are junior forwards 
Tyler Motte and JT Compher.

Compher 
captained 
the 

Wolverines this year, but could 
potentially leave Ann Arbor to 
join the Colorado Avalanche 

organization. Motte — who was 
second on the team in goals with 
32 — faces a similar decision 
with the Chicago Blackhawks.

But if the duo decides to 

return for their senior seasons, 
it could foreshadow Berenson’s 
future at Yost Ice Arena.

“I’m not going to lose a lot of 

sleep over it at this point, but 
I would feel better about our 
team moving forward (with 
JT and Tyler),” Berenson said. 
“They’re the leaders of this team 
and they would be the leaders of 
next year’s team. … Let’s face it, 
they’re the guys that are going 
to drive the bus.”

But 
those 
are 
individual 

decisions Motte and Compher 
must make for themselves.

As for Berenson, all we can do 

is wait.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Michigan hockey coach Red Berenson will take his time before deciding whether to return as coach next season.

to lose sleep 
over it at this 

point.”

Blue Jackets sign 
D-man Werenski

By JUSTIN MEYER & 
JASON RUBINSTEIN 

Daily Sports Writers

With the talent the Michigan 

hockey team brings in each 
year, early NHL defections are 
inevitable. And this year is no 
different.

Tuesday morning, sophomore 

defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski 

agreed to a three-year entry 
level contract with the NHL’s 
Columbus 
Blue 
Jackets 
and 

signed 
an 
amateur 
tryout 

contract with the American 
Hockey 
League’s 
Lake 
Erie 

Monsters — the Blue Jacket’s 
minor league affiliate — for the 
remainder of the season. The 
Daily first reported Werenski 
had been in contract talks with 
the Blue Jackets organization on 
Monday night.

Werenski, 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Defenseman of the Year, was 
drafted eighth overall in the 
2015 NHL Draft. In a breakout 
sophomore season, he tallied 
11 goals and 24 assists during 
the season, and his 35 points 
ranked fourth on the team. He 
also anchored the Wolverines’ 
nation-leading 
power-play 

unit. Werenski came back to 
Michigan for his sophomore 
season after a strong freshman 
year, which he said was a 
difficult decision.

“I wanted to come back here 

to learn as a player, just grow 
my game in all three zones,” 
Werenski told the Daily earlier 
this year. “The main thing is 
learning and becoming a better 
player. I think I did a good job 
of that in the first half (of the 
season). I think that really 
showed at World Juniors — how 
good of a job Michigan has done 
developing their players.” 

Werenski played his best at the 

end of the season, drawing praise 
from Wolverines head coach Red 
Berenson.

“I think he played the best 

hockey of his two-year career 
at Michigan in these last couple 
months and showed Columbus 
that he was a real serious 
prospect. If they could sign him, 
they were going to sign him, and 
they did,” Berenson said. “He 
started to play like he could play. 
He loved the puck more, he got 
his shots through, he was more 
involved in the whole game 
physically, defensively. He broke 
up big plays. He really played like 
he was trying to take it to a new 
level.

“He needed to be reminded 

sometimes that he’s got the green 
light to go.”

Added Weresnki: “I kind of 

realized it after (this season’s) 
World Juniors. I don’t know 
why it didn’t register in college 
hockey for me earlier on.

“The coaches have so much 

faith in me. I just had to go out 
there and believe it.”

The 18-year-old reported to 

Lake Erie on Tuesday, and is set to 
face off against senior Michigan 
forward Justin Selman — who 
signed with the Chicago Wolves 
— on Friday. Werenski said he 
has not had any discussion about 
the timing of his move to the Blue 
Jacket’s roster, but that it would 
depend on his play.

“There’s a lot of unknowns 

and things I’ve never been 
exposed to in the pro lifestyle,” 
Werenski said. “But I think going 
to Michigan, and going to college 
anywhere, really prepares you 
for the challenges ahead.

“Michigan 
does 
a 
really 

good job of making you a better 
person.”

Aggressive offense key 
in Michigan’s 9-7 win

Slater leads 
Wolverines’ 

offensive charge in 

home debut

By ETHAN WOLFE 

Daily Sports Writer

In the bottom of the first inning 

of the Michigan baseball team’s 
Tuesday game against Central 
Michigan, Jake Bivens smacked 
a line drive to left center field. As 
the junior third baseman turned 
the corner around first base, his 
run turned into a slow jog on his 
way to a stand-up double.

Bivens’ leadoff hit set the stage 

for the rest of the game, which 
saw the 20th-ranked Wolverines’ 
lineup have little trouble getting 
on base, powering Michigan to a 
9-7 win over the Chippewas.

Bivens’ 
hit 
helped 
the 

Wolverines (17-5) take the early 
1-0 lead, as he scored after two 
consecutive groundouts pushed 
him home.

Junior right fielder Johnny 

Slater, who made his first home 
start of the season, made a 
powerful impression when he 
crushed the ball for a two-run 
double off the left center field 
wall in the second inning.

“It felt good,” said Slater. “My 

swing is starting to feel better 
and it’s getting better every day.”

Added Michigan coach Erik 

Bakich: “He’s been working hard. 
He had some tough luck earlier in 
the season, but nobody has lost 
any confidence in his ability. It 
was good to see him drive a ball 
to the fence, get a couple RBIs 
and get on the bases. He can 
change the game with his speed.”

The offense continued to pour 

on runs in the second inning. 
Slater stole third base standing 
up and Bivens grounded into a 
fielder’s choice to drive him in. 
Bivens followed suit, stealing 
second 
base 
and 
eventually 

crossing home from a single by 

fifth-year senior left fielder Matt 
Ramsay.

Overall, six Wolverine batters 

recorded RBIs on Tuesday. But 
more notably, they stole a season-
high six bases.

“We saw that our opponent 

had given up a lot of stolen bases, 
so we thought that would be 
something to push and take some 
chances,” Bakich said. “We talk 
a lot about getting extra bases 
and getting into scoring position. 
Our guys did a good job of getting 
those opportunities.”

After encountering trouble 

from 
Central 
Michigan 
(1-2 

Mid-American, 5-20 overall) in 
the seventh inning that resulted 
in a tied score of 6-6, Michigan 
responded immediately.

Ramsay walked and junior 

first baseman Carmen Benedetti 
singled to start the frame. They 
executed a double steal with no 

throw from the catcher. With both 
runners in scoring position, junior 
catcher Harrison Wenson hit a 
sacrifice fly and scored Ramsay to 
recapture Michigan’s lead.

The play after, the Wolverines 

again showcased their speed, as 
Benedetti scored on a wild pitch 
to extend their lead, 8-6.

“We 
have 
a 
team 
that 

understands that you’re going to 
have to a take a punch and you’re 
going to have to get back up,” 
Bakich said. “Multiple times now, 
we’ve had to find a way (to win). 
It’s a sign of a team that’s tough 
and resilient.”

Unlike most of the team’s 

previous games, it was not 
Michigan’s pitching that carried 
the team. Rather, the Wolverines 
swung consistently and had 
their best day of the season so 
far on the basepaths. And it paid 
dividends.

Wolverines top Chippewas

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball team 

shuffled its lineup on Tuesday 
and let junior Johnny Slater hit 
eighth 
in 

the rotation, 
and 
the 

move 
turned out to be beneficial for the 
Wolverines. 

Slater, in his first appearance 

at Ray Fisher stadium this season, 
knocked in two runs with a double 
to left-center field in the bottom of 
the second inning. 

“It felt good,” Slater said. “I’ve 

been working on my swing, and 
it’s starting to feel better. We don’t 
worry too much on who we’re 
playing, we just focus on us.”

Slater’s 
double 
allowed 

sophomore 
designated 
hitter 

Drew 
Lugbauer 
and 
senior 

centerfielder Cody Bruder to make 
it home safely. Then, the junior 
right fielder scored as well, and the 
inning finished out with a run by 
Jake Bivens, leaving the score 5-0. 

And 
the 
Wolverines 
never 

looked back, riding Slater’s strong 
home debut to defeat Central 
Michigan on Tuesday, 9-7.

Junior pitcher Keith Lehmann 

contributed to Michigan’s hot 
start after throwing a quick first 
two innings. It was the first time 
he’s started at home, but that didn’t 
phase him.

“Regardless of the role, I don’t 

look at it as starting is bigger 
than coming out of the bullpen,” 
Lehmann said. “It’s the same 
thing and you prepare the same 
way. ” 

The 
only 
hiccup 
in 
his 

performance was a wild pitch that 
hit Chippewa second baseman 
Jason Sullivan in the cheek. 
Sullivan quickly went down and 
it took a couple minutes before 
he was able to stand up and walk 
off he field. Sullivan’s classmate 
Jarrod Watkins pinch ran for 
Sullivan to first. 

“That was not what I wanted to 

do,” Lehmann said. “I don’t know 
what happened. It looked like 
(Sullivan) didn’t see it. I clearly 

wasn’t trying to do that, so I went 
up and apologized. But that’s 
baseball, it happens.” 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich, 

following 
the 
hit, 
took 
out 

Lehmann — the first of six pitching 
substitutions. 

According to Lehmann, that’s 

the beauty of the Wolverine 
pitching staff. Every athlete is 
able to come out of the bullpen 
and be effective on the mound. 
It helps that Michigan is strong 
offensively, too. 

“It’s fantastic,” Lehmann said. 

“The team itself, offensively, 
this year is a very good offensive 
team. No matter who you are 
as a pitcher, if you have a good 
hitting team, it makes your job a 
lot easier.” 

In the top of the third inning, 

Central Michigan scored its first 
runs 
when 
sophomore 
Zach 

McKinstry doubled to left field and 
batted in two runs. 

Michigan (16-5) has played the 

Chippewas (5-20) every year since 
1991, compiling an overall record 
of 39-28 and the Wolverines have 
won the last six consecutive 
games. Despite a bind in the 
seventh inning, this contest was no 
different.

Michigan was tied 6-6 with 

Central Michigan in the bottom 
of the seventh. But after two 
stolen bases, a run on a wild pitch 
and a single RBI, the Wolverines 
scored three runs to assure the 
Chippewas’ defeat. 

Junior first baseman Carmen 

Benedetti and fifth-year senior left 
fielder Matt Ramsay stole second 
and third, respectively. Following 
the play, junior catcher Harrison 
Wenson flew out to right field, 
allowing Ramsay to make a run. 
Benedetti soon scored on a wild 
pitch to make it 8-6. 

Wenson, who is the cleanup 

hitter, went 0-3 at bat, but still 
managed to keep his batting 
average at .400. The slump comes 
after an impressive weekend, 
but according to Bakich, “That’s 
baseball.”

“We have a team that knows 

how to find a way and respond,” 
Bakich said. “We know you’re 
going to get knocked down and 
you’re going to have to get back up, 
which is what we’ve done.”

O’Korn ready for action after sitting out 2015

Now eligible, 

Houston transfer 

hopes to make 
on-field impact

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

John O’Korn hasn’t played 

in a football game since Nov. 
28, 2014, but his year away may 
have been the most important 
one of his career.

The 
redshirt 
junior 

quarterback arrived at Michigan 
last fall after a tumultuous 
career 
at 
Houston 
that 

ultimately led to his transfer. 
O’Korn won the starting job as 

a freshman and threw for 3,117 
yards and 28 touchdowns, but 
he lost his spot to converted 
receiver Greg Ward Jr. after just 
five games the next year.

“It was just a (comfort) 

thing,” O’Korn said. “I kind of 
felt out of place there at times. 
Part of that’s my fault, and 
part of that is just the nature of 
playing in a spread offense as a 
pro-style quarterback. I think 
that’s the number-one thing, 
just (comfort) — I think this 
system fits me a lot better and 
allows me to be the best player 
I can be.”

Of course, O’Korn wasn’t 

able to get back on the field 
right away. Per NCAA transfer 
eligibility rules, he had to sit out 
the 2015 season. But now, with 

the Wolverines in the heat of 
spring camp, O’Korn is finally 
a factor again as he competes 
with redshirt sophomore Wilton 
Speight and redshirt junior 
Shane Morris for the starting 
job.

He didn’t just sit idly on the 

sidelines for a year, though. 
Working as a member of the 
scout team all season, O’Korn 
was an extremely active practice 
player, and he was present in 
just as many meetings and drills 
as a starter would have been. 
After six months of inactivity 
since he lost the job at Houston, 
O’Korn’s role in the fall was a 
welcome return to normalcy.

“Any time you spend time 

away 
from 
the 
game, 
you 

appreciate it more,” O’Korn 
said. “I started to miss the little 
things that I didn’t really realize 
I would miss — chalk talk, 
drawing up plays, watching film 
hours on end in a dark room by 
yourself.”

It wasn’t long before O’Korn 

started to feel settled in at 
Michigan. And even though he 
found himself surrounded by 
a decorated coaching staff — 
including a quarterback guru 
of a head coach in Harbaugh 
— O’Korn’s biggest resource 
ended up being his roommate: 
2015 starting quarterback Jake 
Rudock.

In many ways, Rudock and 

O’Korn have parallel stories. 
Rudock was also a starter at 
his former school, Iowa, before 
unceremoniously losing his job 
and departing as a transfer. 
Rudock, too, began his career 
with the Wolverines embroiled 
in 
a 
preseason 
quarterback 

competition, 
which 
he 

ultimately won before going on 
to throw for 3,017 yards — the 
second-highest 
single-season 

total in Michigan history. 

The two quarterbacks even 

went to the same high school, 
St. Thomas Aquinas in Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla.

In his time as the starter, 

Rudock gained a reputation as 
a quiet leader who rarely made 
crucial mistakes. As O’Korn 
tried 
to 

acclimate 
to 

his new team, 
he 
quickly 

realized 
that 

his roommate 
was setting the 
perfect model 
to follow.

“With Jake, 

he’s not really 
the type that’s 
gonna 
say 
a 

whole lot,” O’Korn said. “But just 
watching him, how he operates, 
how he prepares for games, how 
seriously he takes everything — 
the minute details, everything 

is so important — just watching 
him was really good. I could 
sit here and talk all day about 
things I learned from watching 

Jake.”

A 
few 

months 
later, 

Rudock — who 
flew 
under 

the radar for 
much of his 
collegiate 
career 
— 
is 

preparing for 
a 
potential 

career in the 
NFL. 
And 

O’Korn, no longer relegated 
to 
the 
sidelines, 
might 
be 

on his way to becoming his 
roommate’s successor. A pro-
style 
quarterback 
with 
the 

ability to use his feet to get out 
of trouble, he brings a unique 
skill set that will certainly have 
him in the mix.

To win the job, though, he’ll 

have to beat out two other 
quarterbacks who have already 
played meaningful snaps for the 
Wolverines. 
O’Korn, 
Speight 

and Morris are very different 
players, 
and 
Harbaugh 
has 

said the player who separates 
himself from the others will 
have done so by limiting his big 
mistakes.

O’Korn has had a year of 

preparation to figure out how to 
do that. And if he continues to 
follow the Rudock model, he’ll 
be taking the field on Sept. 3 
for the first time in nearly two 
years.

John O’Korn sat out last season after transferring from Houston and is now in a three-way quarterback competition.

“This system 

allows me to be 
the best player I 

can be. ”

Speight determined to stay 
in starting QB conversation

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Throughout last summer — 

and, really, well into last fall — 
Wilton Speight felt overlooked. 
Then a redshirt freshman for the 
Michigan football team, he was a 
solid third on the depth chart at 
quarterback.

There was Jake Rudock, a 

graduate transfer brought in from 
Iowa to be an immediate solution. 
And there was Shane Morris, 
a former four-star recruit who 
had been touted as the starter-
in-waiting for his whole career. 
Morris seized the job coming out 
of spring camp, and Rudock took 
hold of it during fall camp. That 
left little attention for Speight.

He would talk to his parents 

about feeling left out. They told 
him not to worry about it, so he 
didn’t. He came into the season 
knowing what he was capable of.

Slowly, he began to edge his 

way into the conversation. Morris 
planned on redshirting if he 
wasn’t starting, so Speight took 
the “mop-up duty” at the end of 
blowout wins. He used that to 
gain the trust of the coaching 
staff.

But on Halloween, Speight was 

no longer an afterthought — he 
couldn’t be. With Rudock injured, 
he came in and led a game-
winning touchdown drive to help 
the Wolverines to a 29-26 victory 
at Minnesota. He then returned to 
his No. 2 spot on the depth chart 
and waited for his opportunity, 
newly confident and no longer 
overlooked.

“It 
would 
give 
anybody 

confidence, to be able to go into a 
game like that and make an impact 
and eventually win the game,” 
Speight said. “To carry that with 
you, not that you’re living in the 
past, but you know you can do it 
going forward.”

Now it’s a new season, with 

Rudock 
gone 
and 
Houston 

transfer John O’Korn into the 
mix. But Speight denies that 
he’s back to square one in the 
competition this time around.

“With all respect, I was going 

to approach it with the mindset 
of, ‘I’ve got to build off of the 
spot I left off in the Minnesota 
game or the bowl practices,’ ” 
Speight said. “I wasn’t going to go 
down to wherever (the coaches) 
expected us to, because I just 
wanted to stay up there and keep 
working.”

Speight may not be overlooked 

anymore, 
but 
he 
is 
still 

unheralded. He acknowledges 
Morris has the strongest arm, 
O’Korn the quickest feet. But 
he knew after he finished the 
season last year and went through 
bowl practices that he’d be in the 
mix. The team treated the bowl 
practices as an audition for spring 
camp, reiterating that at every 
turn.

For the first two weeks of spring 

practice, all the quarterbacks took 
equal reps. Then, they began to 
separate themselves.

Speight said that throughout 

spring camp, the coaches tracked 
how each quarterback did moving 
the ball down the field in drills.

“Just looking at the stats, 

I guess that’s where I kind of 
distance myself,” he said.

Saturday at Ford Field in 

Detroit, Speight was the first 
quarterback to take snaps with 
the first team at open practice. 
Tuesday, he said that has been the 
case in other recent practices, too.

“Coach follows a pattern, and 

unless you mess it up, it pretty 
much stays the same,” Speight 
said. “The practice before that, 
I did what I needed to do, and 
before that, and before that. I 
pretty much knew that was going 
to happen.”

But he also knows what being 

first — especially by the slimmest 
of margins — means. He has, after 
all, been on the other end.

“It means there’s people at my 

feet and they’re wanting to take 
the spot I’m in,” Speight said. “If I 
don’t keep doing what I have to do 
and keep working my ass off, then 
they’re going to fill me in.

“Because you’re replaceable 

at anything you do in life. That’s 
all it really means — I’m getting 
the job done, but someone else is 
trying to do it better.”

THE MICHIGAN DAILY MARCH 30, 2016


I 

have this theory that most people have had an 
eccentric English teacher. The theory developed 
once after I was telling a friend about my own 

unconventional English teacher from high school, and 
she admitted she had had one, too. Because I’m the 
only person from my class at the University of Michi-
gan, I feel pretty comfortable writing about Ruth. 
More specifically, I have no problem revealing that she 
was most likely the most bizarre teacher I’ve ever had. 
But that was a lot of her appeal to me.

During the summer between 10th and 11th grade, I 

received an envelope with a few sheets of paper, each 
detailing a specific assignment. One was to come up 
with a list of vocabulary words I didn’t know in each of 
the assigned summer readings, define them and write 
sentences with them. Another was to write a different 
style of essay on each book. The last was to take a list 
of commonly misused words and use them correctly. 
That was the beginning of Ruth.

The first day of class, I encountered an old woman 

wearing a denim dress, with her hair in a chignon. 
This pattern — denim dress, often with seasonal 
embroidery, but not always, and chignon — would 
continue for every single day of the school year. But 
this sweet-looking woman immediately had everyone 
in the class draw an oval in highlighter and outline it 
in red pen onto a notecard. Those would become our 
“yellow egg” cards, and we had to correct any mis-
takes we made with our commonly misused words on 
them all year. Other Ruth highlights include playing 
loon calls in class when we read Thoreau, passing an 
eyelash curler around the class to demonstrate what it 
was and memorizing the AP scores of all her previous 
students.

This is all said endearingly, because I honestly 

believe Ruth is the reason I’m an English major and 
copy editor now. I know the differences between your 
and you’re; they’re, there and their; who and whom 
and, at least mostly, lay, lie and lie. I don’t want to brag, 
but I never had to use my “yellow egg” card. The beau-
ty of the ridiculous English teacher (or any teacher, 
really) is that you remember them and, peripherally, 
some of what they taught you. I remember the loon 
calls, and I remember Thoreau. I remember Ruth’s 

love of Robert Redford and the shirt scene in the 1974 
“Great Gatsby” and I remember the green light. Every 
time I write an essay, I remember the time she imme-
diately handed an essay back to one of my peers when 
he turned it in because it wasn’t in Times New Roman, 
so I always use Times New Roman even when it’s not 
required.

When I first told someone about Ruth, he laughed at 

me and told me she sounded crazy. But when I started 
asking around, I learned that I’m not alone. Almost all 
of my housemates and fellow copy editors have sto-
ries about their own Ruths, including an interesting 
tale about a crow named Walter. That we all remem-
ber these peculiar moments and teachers, years after 
we had them, says a lot to me. Even the teachers you 
might complain about and think are unreasonable now 
are teaching you something, and you’ll probably end 
up telling your kids about them when they complain 
about their teachers. At the very least, you have a will-
ing listener in me. I’m always looking for more Ruth 
stories.

I

t’s Spring Break of my freshman year of college 
and my dad and I slip into the Ford Fusion in our 
apartment building’s parking lot. I had no intention 

of ever driving again after my accident, but my parents 
insisted.

Our building sits on a major road that cuts through the 

heart of our town. The turn out of the parking lot scares 
me, so I sit in the passenger seat and watch my dad drive 
us to a nearby residential area — a quiet neighborhood 
with tree-lined streets and cozy houses that sit close 
together. Calm down, I tell myself. It won’t happen again.

•••

When my doctor asked me what it felt like, I told her it 

was kind of like being naked — a thick blanket of security 
I didn’t even know was there had suddenly been ripped 
from my shoulders, leaving me in a hyper-cautious and 
vulnerable state. I fought back tears as I tried to explain, 
but she told me this was good, so I continued:

Each time I crossed the street, entered a moving vehi-

cle or heard balloons pop or glass bottles hit the ground, 
I felt all at once entirely exposed and defenseless. I 
would cringe, close my eyes, clench my fists and wait for 
the feeling to pass.

Not long after this feeling took hold, I began doubting 

my own common sense. I convinced myself that if I didn’t 
look both ways, three times each, before letting my feet 
leave the sidewalk, I would surely miss an oncoming car. 
If I didn’t close my eyes from the passenger seat as my 
friend made a left turn, my mind convinced my body it 
would happen all over again. 

The left window would shatter as the car turned over, 

and there I would be: hanging from my seatbelt, my tears 
dripping sideways onto the shirt of my friend who had 
been driving. My ears were stinging from the blast of the 
air bag and my torso was achingg from the pull of the 
seat-belt. People rushed into the intersection, tapped on 
the windshield and called 911, but I was screaming and 
no one on the outside could hear me. 

•••

I constantly remind myself that I’m among the lucki-

est people on Earth.

“The car did exactly what it was supposed to do; it took 

the impact,” the police officer told my parents, who were 
staring at the vehicle, tipped over on its side and com-
pressed like a thin sheet of paper.

The emergency room doctor assured me after several 

X-rays that my pain was simply bruising that would fade 
in time. Some gross black and blue marks, and sporadic 
stiff aches that made it difficult to crane my neck or fall 
asleep, and that was it: I really am one of the luckiest 
people on Earth.

But in some sense, both the sheriff and the ER doc-

tor, who each gracefully dealt with my family’s collective 
hysteria, were wrong. There was an impact that none of 
the latest safety features could absorb. There were bruis-
es that wouldn’t fade for months — maybe even years.

•••

It’s been almost two years since the accident, and I 

still find myself clenching my fists as I cross the street 
and letting out small gasps from the passenger’s seat in 
the middle of busy intersections. The most painful part 
is not the moment itself, but the memory: When crossing 
the street to meet friends for coffee or in the car on the 
way home from a movie, the feeling comes back to me 
unexpectedly.

The memory hurts, but I’ve noticed it’s gradually 

faded. With help, I’ve realized the most important part 
of the healing process is to let myself be upset — to let 
myself remember the accident without crying over the 
fact that I’ll never be able to fully forget about it. In time, 
I tell myself, it won’t hurt as much.

Far away from the hills and hot weather 

of Silicon Valley, where Google has made 
headlines with their driverless car testing, the 
University of Michigan is helping bring the 
national spotlight on the national race to build 
driverless cars to the state.

On the University’s North Campus there’s 

a 32-acre urban environment with freeways, 
dirt roads, road signs and highway tunnels — 
known as “Mcity.” The field grabbed national 
and international attention when it opened 
in July 2015, becoming the world’s first site 
designed for the purpose of testing driverless 
cars.

But why here?
The University did not build Mcity alone. 

Mcity was designed and developed by the 
University’s Mobility Transformation Center, 
a research partnership between industry and 
government to improve transportation safety 
and sustainability. The Michigan Department 
of Transportation partnered with MTC 
to create and help fund Mcity, and the site 
is currently led by corporate partners like 
Ford, Toyota, State Farm Mutual Automobile 
Insurance and General Motors.

In 
partnership 
with 
prominent 
auto 

industries in Southeast Michigan and the 
city, state and federal governments, Mcity 

represents the ways local leaders are working 
to usher in a new era of transportation in the 
same area that Henry Ford redefined mobility 
over a century ago.

How the University leads driverless car 

development

Alongside 
Mcity’s 
various 
highways, 

intersections and dirt roads sit graffiti covered 
road signs, steep hills and building facades 
that can be brought just inches away from 
the road — all details meant to create life-like 
scenarios to challenge autonomous vehicles.

Ford became the first motor company to test 

an autonomous vehicle in Mcity in November 
2015, and they used the site again to challenge 
their technology in snowy conditions in 
January 2016.

Jim McBride, Ford technical leader for 

autonomous vehicles, said Mcity was an ideal 
site because of its simulated imperfection, 
creating odd scenarios driverless cars might 
experience in the real world.

“Mcity allows us the ability to create that 

situation and find a safe environment and test 
it repeatedly,” McBride said.

Creating all kinds of life-like challenges 

for driverless cars is exactly what Mcity was 

designed for, according to Huei Peng, director 
of MTC.

MTC and Mcity were created in an effort 

to expand development of automation and 
connected vehicles both at the University 
and in the state. Gradual steps in advancing 
non-driver controlled technology, as well as 
in connecting cars to each other and their 
environment like an Internet, are ways in 
which engineers are moving toward fully 
autonomous vehicles.

“Mcity is a test track designed to have 

future connected automated vehicle concepts 
in mind,” Peng said. 

Cars on the market today already have 

partially driverless vehicle features. Cruise 
control, automatic braking and assisted 
parking systems are features in a vehicle that 
occur without direct driver input, referred to 
as “automated.”

SAE International — originally founded 

as the Society of Automotive Engineers — 
characterizes the degree of automation in 
on-road vehicles in six levels, zero being 
completely driver-controlled and five being 
completely system-controlled. A driverless 
car is a vehicle with a system that controls all 
dynamic driving tasks under all roadway and 
environmental conditions.

Many cars on the road are at a level one 

standard for automation, and include features 
such as cruise control and automated braking. 
In the next few years, however, Peng said 
there will be an emergence of level two and 
level three features — like highway cruise, 
traffic jam assist and automated valet parking 
— in production vehicles.

Engineers of driverless cars are also 

developing wireless connection channels, 
called dedicated short-range communications, 
to allow cars to communicate with each other 
on the road. Peng explained that when personal 
computers are connected to each other, every 
PC becomes more useful; similarly, cars can 
reduce risk and improve efficiency if they 
connect to other vehicles.

“If we continue to broadcast the vehicle’s 

motion to other cars, it will make traffic safer, 
potentially more efficient, and (lead to) less 
energy consumption,” Peng said.

Even before Mcity garnered international 

attention, the University had been a pioneer in 
mobility transformation research.

Noting research on tire dynamics, engines 

and vehicle safety developed at the University, 
Peng 
said 
vehicle 
design 
and 
vehicle 

manufacturing have been pillars of strength 
at the College of Engineering for years.

“We have been the top, if not one of the top, 

automotive engineering research education 
providers among other universities in the 
world,” he said. “We will continue to do that; 
there is no reason we give up that tradition of 
strength.”

Michigan as a hotbed for mobility 

transformation

Since 
being 
elected 
to 
Congress 
in 

2014, Sen. Gary Peters (D–Michigan) has 
joined the Senate Commerce, Science and 
Transportation Committee and has actively 
promoted legislation to allow for more funding 
to implement for vehicle-to-infrastructure 
technology. According to Peters, these efforts 
are to ensure the state of Michigan’s influence 
in the future of mobility.

“This technology is incredibly important 

for our safety and it represents the future of 
the auto industry,” Peters said. “We have to 
make every effort to make sure it continues to 
be centered in Michigan.”

Alongside Peters’ efforts at the federal 

level, MDOT and state legislature have been 
proactive in allowing for driverless car testing 
on the roads. In December 2013, Gov. Rick 
Snyder (R) signed into law a bill approving 
the testing of driverless cars on Michigan 
roads, joining only a handful of other states in 
approving such legislation.

Matt Smith, program manager at MDOT, 

said because of the auto industry’s location 
within the state, the Michigan state legislature 
has allowed for automated vehicle research on 
state roads long before driverless cars existed.

“The state of Michigan has allowed 

experimental technology on roadways for 
many, many years,” Smith said.

Even within Ann Arbor, local government 

has 
pushed 
for 
testing 
experimental 

automated technology. In 2013, Ann Arbor 
City Council approved a $622,884 federal 
grant to install telecommunications fiber, 
sensors and electronic equipment in public 
intersections to allow for vehicle-to-vehicle 
and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication 
in driverless cars.

Peters said the reason legislators are 

interested in pursuing autonomous technology 
in the state is to keep jobs related to the auto 
industry within Michigan.

Kevin Kerrigan, senior vice president 

of the Michigan Economic Development 
Corporation, noted that the automotive 
industry continues to be the largest industry 
in Michigan, attracting many businesses 
and growing local jobs. Currently, one out of 
every 24 jobs in the state comes from the auto 
industry, according to the Mackinac Center for 
Public Policy. Jobs within the auto industry 
increased by 67 percent after the recession 
ended, compared to 10.6 percent gain in all 
jobs.

“A big percentage of jobs in Michigan 

are directly related to the auto industry,” 
Peters said. “If we were to lose some of 
the technological advantage of advanced 
computer systems related to cars, I would be 
concerned we would start losing automotive 
jobs to a different region of the country.”

McBride said Ford’s interest in pursuing 

driverless car development was in part to 
ensure the company stays relevant when the 

technology advances. Kodak and Nokia, he 
said, are examples of companies that could not 
adapt to the changes in the telecommunication 
and digital world, which led to their 
breakdowns.

“It’s very relevant right now that we 

maintain ownership of the software and 
ownership of the technology if we want to 
be viable in the future of transportation 
industry,” McBride said. “Every company 
wants to be relevant in the long term, and 
that’s not different for Ford.”

Michigan has recently taken a step 

further in leading the charge for automated 
and connected vehicles by announcing the 
American Center for Mobility in January 
— a joint partnership between government, 
business and University leaders to help build 
another driverless car testing site — this time, 
at 335 acres. The new site will be placed in 
Willow Run, where B-24 bombers were made 
for troops in a Henry Ford factory during 
World War II.

John Maddox, assistant director of MTC 

and recently named president and CEO of 
ACM, said the new testing site was designed 
due to the success and demand of Mcity. While 
Mcity is primarily designed to test early stage 
research, once vehicles “graduate” from the 
smaller testing site, they can use the larger 
testing site for product development.

Maddox said Michigan’s location as the 

birthplace and home to the auto industry is 
one of a kind in the world, and puts the state in 
the center of driverless car development.

“There is a significant concentration of 

expertise and activity happening in Southeast 
Michigan,” Maddox said. “In fact, I would 
say it’s unique in the world, not just in the 
United States, for having such a concentration 
in a local area of so many companies and 
individuals and universities working on this 
automotive technology.”

The future of autonomous vehicles and 

robotics

When asked whether the emergence of 

connected, autonomous vehicles will lead to 
a transportation revolution similar to when 
Henry Ford helped bring cars to the mass 
market in 1908, Maddox said no — it would be 
bigger.

He equated the growth of connected, 

driverless cars to how the Internet helped 
connect people in new ways, and brought 
about new job opportunities. In the same 
way, he said, autonomous vehicles have the 
potential to transform mobility to allow for a 
whole new economic sector.

“We will see an Internet for transportation 

and an Internet for cars,” he said. “Just like the 
Internet brought tremendous new business 
opportunities, new business models, the 
same thing will happen with the Internet for 
transportation.

With driverless cars, mobility will also 

come to groups unable to drive vehicles like 
the elderly and disabled, Smith said.

“We do believe that automated vehicle 

technology is certainly going make the roads 
a lot safer,” he said. “It’s going to increase 
mobility, allow more traffic flow and probably 
allow mobility access to people who can’t 
drive.”

Peng also highlighted the safety benefits 

of driverless car technology, noting how 
right now motor vehicles currently kill about 
33,000 people in the United States and 1.2 
million people in the world per year. He said by 
connecting cars together and allowing them to 
“speak” to each other and to the infrastructure 
around them, we can dramatically reduce 
risky behavior like emergency braking, illegal 
turns, wrong way driving and running red 
lights can be dramatically reduced.

“All those behaviors, in theory, if we 

continue to broadcast the vehicle’s motion 
to other cars, it will make traffic safer, 
potentially more efficient, and (lead to) less 
energy consumption,” Peng said.

However, machine autonomy does not have 

to stop at vehicles.

Aerospace Engineering prof. Ella Atkins, 

who chairs the graduate program for Robotics 
at the University, said students have a lot 
of interest and excitement for autonomous 
machines. 
particularly 
in 
autonomous 

machines.

Atkins said even aside from high-profile 

autonomous technology like driverless cars, 
small, low-powered sensors and computers 
will allow for a flurry of autonomous 
technology.

“There are a lot of opportunities for robots 

that never get tired, and are very patient with 
people not only in driving their cars for them, 
but also in helping them with everyday tasks,” 
Atkins said.

Peng, too, noted the way autonomous 

technology beyond self-driving has the 
potential to reduce ever-increasing human 
errors like drunk driving and texting on the 
road. Though he cautioned driverless cars are 
still far from the mass market, the technology 
is advancing rapidly and exponentially.

“We humans are distracted more and more 

every day,” Peng said. “Robots are improving 
every day. Guess who will win the race?”

“Set fire to your old self. It’s not need-

ed here. It’s too busy shopping, gossip-
ing about others, and watching days go 
by and asking why you haven’t gotten 
as far as you’d like. This old self will die 
and be forgotten by all but family, and 
replaced by someone who makes a dif-
ference.

Your new self is not like that. Your 

new self is the Great Chicago Fire—over-
whelming, overpowering, and destroy-
ing everything that isn’t necessary.”

-Julien Smith, The Flinch

I tried to be good at Instagram. 
Really.
Over Spring Break, I met a group of 

girls who were all good at Instagram. 
Like, tens of thousands of followers 
good. When we hung out, we would 
stop every now and then to take pic-
tures, which were swiftly edited and 
posted at the best times for optimal 
likes. One of them told me that her life 
is awesome, and her Instagram would 
be too if she just took quality pictures 
of her terrific life.

This is a good perspective, I thought. 

Crafting some sort of Instagram pres-
ence in which I take excellent photos 
of me adventuring or wearing cute 
outfits for some reason stood out to 
me as a necessary action. As I began 
to realize, it’s important to craft one’s 
image and present to the world what 
you want your aesthetic to be. It’s good 
to show that you’re confident, pleased 
with your appearance and proud of 
your life.

I took this to heart, dreaming of a 

polished exterior that others might 
aspire to. New Rachel! Confident 
Rachel! The majority of my presence 
is some sort of cobbled-together, self-
deprecating spaz whose shirt might 
have guacamole stains. Maybe Insta-
gram Rachel could be cool, sleek—con-
toured, with frizz-free hair.

So I tried to ‘gram. The problem is, 

you have to take pictures to have an 
Instagram. Then you have to come up 
with some sort of caption that indi-
cates that you didn’t try that hard at 

any of it, even though you’re about to 
spend the next 90 minutes frantically 
refreshing your notifications for likes 
and the other part of your day strategi-
cally liking other people’s pictures on 
your feed in hopes that they’ll like your 
stuff back.

When I returned from Spring Break, 

my friend and I talked about our vaca-
tions over a $3 bottle of wine. Unlike 
my Instagram revelation, she was 
frustrated that her friends spent the 
majority of break trying to position 
themselves perfectly for ideal photos 
to post. More than that, they would 
stare at their phones at dinner and at 
the beach, checking Snapchat stories 
and ensuring they were getting enough 
likes.

They cared more about how their 

life appeared than their actual life.

I brushed off my friend’s comments, 

and decided she sounded like Mother 
Skeptical about my frequent Snap-
chat usage. Millennial communication 
is innovative! Selfies are important! 
Online identity is crucial! We are posi-
tioning ourselves to the world, seeking 
to explain ourselves to others and to 
ourselves! I took this nuanced, subver-
sive perspective to heart.

The weeks wore on after my ‘gram 

revelation. I posted pictures. Noth-
ing seemed fun or cool enough. I took 
shots in the Ann Arbor streets, but who 
the hell wants to see Ann Arbor? We 
all know what it looks like. And who 
wants to see me and my friends drunk 
at Rick’s? It’s really only entertaining 
to us. And who cares about the Eggs 
Benedict that I ate? I do like my life. 
But I don’t know how to portray it on 
this fundamentally shallow website. 
How am I supposed to Instagram a 
funny moment with my friends? Or a 
book that’s fascinating? Do I demand 
my friends take pictures of me when 
I look good, because someone who is 
good at Instagram told me selfies are 
not “Instagram-worthy”?

I’ve noticed most captions of pho-

tos are self-referencing to Instagram 
itself, explaining with a smirk how 
they asked someone to take the pic-
ture or the photo credit or why they’re 
posting it. All of the humor is the same 
tongue-in-cheek shit that I saw on 
Tumblr in 2011 that I guess people in 
Greek life have just recently adopted.

Unless I travel or suddenly develop 

a visually artistic side, my ‘gram can 
really only be contrived pictures of 
me and my friends. It’s a little bit too 

much effort. There must be some rea-
son everyone I know loves this social 
medium, but I can’t quite figure it out.

Today, I’m not destined for good 

selfies. My self is in flux, constantly 
being created and remade, though that 
won’t be shown through Instagram 
anytime soon. Maybe it will change 
tomorrow. That’s the beauty of social 
media and the Internet — I can always 
delete everything from the past and 
start anew.

Finally, you did it. You got into the University of Michigan, and this is cause 

for celebration. After two and a half years of being envious of every game day 
picture your friends posted on their Instagrams, now is your time to shine. Com-
munity college was rough — the lack of a real campus, the constant checking to 
see if the credits would transfer — and going through the application process 
again was a real drag.

Now it’s over, and I’m here to tell you about my first-hand account as a junior 

transfer student.

First of all, my orientation experience wasn’t great. I had to be in Ann Arbor 

at the Michigan Union at 8 a.m. sharp. Now, that’s not a big deal, except for 
the fact that there is literally nowhere to park in Ann Arbor. Plus, the stupid 
parking meters were just way too advanced for me. Whatever happened to just 
using coins? I ended up walking in about 10 minutes late because of the lack of 
parking. It would have been nice of the University to give the newbies a warning 
about the parking (or lack thereof ) situation.

Next, all of the transfer students were put into a room with two student tour 

guides. First, they gave us a run-down of the day ahead, then taught us the fight 
song (which I still don’t have a handle on), and finally the students who had 
to take language placement exams (like me) went off into another room, while 
everyone else toured the campus. My fellow transfer acquaintances and I, who 
were also taking language placement exams, were told we’d be toured around 
the campus later on. Spoiler alert: The tour never happened.

Once the exams were finished, we met back up with the other students. Again, 

we were put into a room, but this time we had a group of students who acted out 
what it was like to be a transfer student at the University. They were fairly good 
and probably the best part of the day, aside from the free lunch. Later on, when it 
was finally time to schedule classes, I went to go and meet with my advisor and 
was quickly informed she was ill. Now what? I waited about half an hour until 
the leaders decided whom I’d be reassigned to.

Once reassigned (side note: my advisor is amazing), we attempted to sign up 

for some classes. Long story short, the system crashed and because we tried to 
wait it out, I missed my opportunity to walk around campus. To sum it up, ori-
entation ended up being no help at all. In fact, it made me more stressed because 
I didn’t know my way around campus, I had to figure out how to do scheduling 
on my own and there was really no time allotted to meet the other transfer kids.

Rant over.
After the winter holidays came to a close, it was finally time for me to move 

out of my family home for the first time, and into my new college home. I had 
a feeling of excitement and shellshock. Suddenly, I was hit with a whole new 
set of responsibilities. First of all, trying to navigate my way across the campus 
to get my bearings (because I didn’t get a tour) was one of the most confusing 
parts. Why in the world are Haven Hall, Mason Hall, Angell Hall and Tisch Hall 
all in the same building? What’s an MLB? Why do people keep calling the library 
UGLi? Since when is Yost an ice arena, and not a breakfast place? These were 
a few of the many questions that would circulate in my mind on a day-to-day 
basis.

Walking into a 200-person lecture hall for the first time was intimidating. The 

teacher had to speak with a microphone. I’ve never experienced any classroom 
environment so intense. It’s clear to me that there are two types of students—
those who are incredibly attentive and those who sleep through the whole lec-
ture. I’d like to say that I’m the first type of student, but I’d be lying. Don’t get 
me wrong, I try my best to give my full attention to the professor, but I can’t deny 
the fact that on more than one occasion, I’ve slipped in and out of sleep.

Luckily, all of my professors and classes this semester are fantastic. Having 

said that, I wish someone had warned me about the amount of reading that’s 
required for each class. Stupidly, I signed up for English and history classes only. 
I keep telling my parents, not only will I be paying back loans for years, but I’ll 
also be catching up on all of my readings.

I’ve talked enough about readings, classes and the confusion/frustration 

of it all. The last thing I want to touch on is the topic of making friends — an 
intimidating topic. First of all, making the move into a house where three out of 
the four girls were in the same sorority was a little scary. I was pretty nervous 
and felt like a total outsider. These girls had known each other for a long time. 
They’ve lived together for at least one full semester, so how will they act toward 
a new girl? Not only am I a “new girl” but I’m also someone who is not into 

Greek life. Are they going to be OK with that? Are they the type who are way 
too invested in the sorority? Do they disapprove of non-sorority girls? These 
questions were weighing heavily on my mind before I met my new housemates. 
I mean, we’re juniors, will they even try to befriend me, or am I just going to be 
someone they live with? Lucky for me, the girls I live with are awesome. They 
were so welcoming and were always offering to include me in their plans. What 
a relief it was to realize I’d be living with such cool people.

As for making friends outside of the house, it’s been a little tricky, and I blame 

part of it on the gross, cold winter weather. Who really wants to be outside and 
social when it’s 15 degrees outside and snowing? I do have to take some of the 
blame and admit that I could be trying harder to put myself out there, but I also 
have to say it’s harder than I thought. I’ve snagged some phone numbers here 
and there, and I’ve even hung out with some people outside of class. Slowly, I’m 
making progress.

Coming to the University is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Although 

it comes with challenging academics and lots of work, the payoff is worth it. 
Being on a real college campus is so exciting, especially for someone coming 
from a small community college. It’s been a little difficult and I hope the next 
group of transfer students have the opportunity to attend a better orientation. 
Other than the unfortunate orientation process that I experienced, Michigan 
has been awesome. I love that it’s located in the heart of Ann Arbor, I love every-
one’s enthusiasm for their school, the buildings are beautiful and I couldn’t pic-
ture myself anywhere else. Working my ass off to get here — still working my ass 
off to stay here — was a challenge like none other.

Being a junior transfer student, at first, felt a little weird. Now, I’m happy to 

say that being here and being a fellow Wolverine feels just like home.

Tucked neatly away above the Pastry Peddler on Packard Ave. is a rather modest-
looking store called PJ’s Records — tucked maybe so neatly that you could walk 
past the speckled shingles of peeling paint and weathered sign every day for a year 
without ever really acknowledging its existence. Hidden inside, however, is a tower-
ing collection of records of all genres and ages, DVDs, CDs, cassettes and a group of 
remarkably vibrant sixty-somethings.
