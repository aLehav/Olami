When 
Ali 
Darwish, 
sophomore at University of 
Michigan-Dearborn, 
found 
himself in the Henry Ford 
Medical 
Center 
emergency 
room in November of his 
freshman 
year, 
he 
was 
frustrated by the inadequate 
care he received compared to 
the University hospitals he 
went to as an Ann Arbor native.
Because U-M Dearborn does 

not have its own on-campus 
health clinic comparable to 
U-M Ann Arbor’s University 
Health Service, the HFMC 
across the street from campus 
was Darwish’s only immediate 
option.
“They didn’t even figure 
out what was wrong, and it 
ended up stretching until 6 
a.m. because no one saw me 
for 
hours,” 
Darwish 
said. 
“They wheeled me around in 
wheelchairs and left me in 
hallways for extended periods 

of time, and at the end, I still 
had the pain and I just left 
with it. I had to come back to 
my U-M health doctor in Ann 
Arbor.” 
For most students at the 
University’s Flint and Dearborn 
campuses, however, finding 
health care is not as easy as a 
trip home to Ann Arbor. While 
the University offers free UHS 
care to all students at the Ann 
Arbor campus, U-M Flint and 
U-M Dearborn do not have 
on-campus health care clinics. 

Instead, they refer students to 
health centers in respective 
communities, 
including 
the 
HFMC and the Genesee Health 
System in Flint. 
The U-M Flint and U-M 
Dearborn student bodies differ 
greatly from U-M Ann Arbor 
in terms of socioeconomic 
status. More than 40 percent 
of undergraduates at U-M Flint 
and U-M Dearborn are Pell 
Grant eligible, compared to 
under 20 percent at U-M Ann 
Arbor.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Christopher Hart, former 
chairman of the National 
Transportation Safety Board, 
spoke to 70 University of 
Michigan 
students 
and 
community members at the 
Ford School of Public Policy 
Monday afternoon about the 
innovation 
of 
autonomous 
vehicles. 
Hart is the chairman of the 
Washington Metrorail Safety 
Commission and the founder 
of Hart Solutions LLC. He has 
also worked for the National 

Aeronautics 
and 
Space 
Administration, the Federal 
Aviation 
Administration 
and was nominated by both 
President Barack Obama and 
President George W. Bush to 
the National Transportation 
Safety Board. 
Robert 
Hampshire, 
associate 
professor 
in 
the 
Public 
Policy 
School, 
introduced Hart before his 
lecture and spoke of Hart’s 
vast experience. 
“I had the pleasure of 
serving on a panel with him 
last year at Princeton reunions 
... and I figured that the Ford 

School 
community 
could 
really benefit from hearing 
his sage advice and his years 
of experience and his career,” 
Hampshire said. 
Hart began his presentation 
by discussing the common 
misconception 
of 
the 
complexity between aviation 
automation and automation on 
the ground. 
“In 
aviation, 
automation 
has shown amazing safety 
benefits, 
productivity, 
operating efficiency, getting 
more 
airplanes 
through 
the airspace and reducing 
pollution all at the same time,” 

Hart said. “And I think that 
the car automation scenario 
has even more opportunities 
for improvement, especially in 
safety.” 
Hart said many of the 
problems with autonomous 
vehicles stem from a lack 
of graceful exits in case of 
emergency or unanticipated 
circumstances. 
“When 
automation 
isn’t 
perfect, you need to have some 
graceful exits,” Hart said.

Only one out of every two 
students who enter the Residential 
College graduate with a degree 
from the program, according to RC 
Director Catherine Badgley.
Students The Daily spoke to 
who left the RC, which provides 
LSA students with a four-year 
interdisciplinary 
liberal 
arts 
program in the form of a living-
learning community, cited stringent 
degree requirements and financial 
stress as reasons for dropping. 
Badgley said about half of the 
students who enter the RC program 
drop within two years. 
“Over the last 20 years, there 
has been a very consistent rate of 
about half the entering class leaving 
the Residential College, but for a 
variety of reasons, and at different 
stages,” Badgley said. “Most of those 
departures occur after the first year, 
or in graduating seniors.”
RC requirements include first- 
and second-year residency within 
East Quad, a first-year writing 
seminar, completion of RC Semi-
Immersion 
Foreign 
Language 
Sequences and an arts practicum in 
the form of an RC creative arts class. 
Students who are non-RC majors 
also have to take four additional 
RC classes.

Flint, Dearborn campuses push 
for University health services

1U members at all three campuses highlight socioeconomic differences, 
put pressure on administration for equitable distribution of resources

Michael Fisher, legal division 
director of the Environmental 
Protection 
Agency 
Office 
of 
Criminal Enforcement, Forensics 
and Training, spoke to a crowd 
of about 20 Law students about 
building a successful law career on 
Monday morning. 
The Environmental Law and 
Policy Program (ELPP), a program 
affiliated with the University 
of Michigan’s Law School that 
prepares students for careers in 
environmental law, hosted the 
talk. 
Fisher’s talk touched on current 
issues 
surrounding 
Michigan 
water 
quality, 
among 
other 
environmental concerns. Since 
2014, the city of Flint has been 
striving to remove lead from its 
drinking water, a public health 
crisis that has caused 12 deaths 
from 
Legionnaires’ 
disease. 
In December of last year, the 
EPA provided $100 million to 
the ongoing Flint water crisis. 
Additionally, the EPA is working 
to 
implement 
more 
stringent 
regulations of lead in drinking 
water. According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 
they have not found a safe level of 
lead exposure.

NASA asks 
Union board 
to rename 
south lounge

Maitland 
Bowen, 
the 
chair 
of 
the 
Native 
American 
Student 
Association presented to the 
Michigan Union Board of 
Representatives on Monday 
evening 
about 
how 
the 
University of Michigan can 
help the Native American 
community 
feel 
more 
included and respected on 
campus. About 50 students 
and 
community 
members 
attended the event.
Bowen proposed that the 
Union’s 
first-floor 
south 
lounge be renamed to honor 
Native 
American 
students 
and community members. 
On behalf of NASA and 
their 
supporters, 
Bowen 
said that if the lounge were 
to be renamed, it would 
be one effort made by the 
University 
to 
recognize 
past offensive practices of 
the 
student 
organization, 
the Order of Angell, toward 
the 
Native 
American 
community. In 1902, then-
University 
President 
James Angell founded the 

student organization, which 
many 
consider 
a 
secret 
society, 
under 
the 
name 
“Michigamua,” the Ojibwe 
word for water.
Michigamua 
met 
on 
the seventh floor in the 
tower of the Union. Their 
meeting 
space 
resembled 
a 
wigwam 
and 
displayed 
Native American statues and 
artifacts. The organization 
further 
appropriated 

Native 
American 
culture 
by 
incorporating 
Native 
practices into their meeting 
rituals.
In 2000, the Students of 
Color Coalition led a 37-day 
demonstration at the Union, 
protesting 
Michigamua’s 
appropriation 
of 
Native 
American culture in their 
organization’s 
practices. 
After the sit-in, the University 
banned 
Michigamua 
from 
using the tower as a meeting 
space. 
Seven 
years 
later, 
Michigamua was reinstated 
under the name Order of 
Angell, a tribute to their 
founder. 
Currently, the Order of 
Angell is again affiliated with 
the University.

DAILY WRITER
who has this position


David Uhlmann, director of the 
ELPP and Law professor, said this 
discussion was part of a career 
series by the Law School to aid 
students in discovering their future 
career paths.
“We sponsor the careers in 
Environmental Law Speaker Series 
to expose students to the range of 
different career opportunities in 
environmental, natural resources 
and energy law,” Uhlmann said.

During his talk, Fisher described 
his career path from summer 
internships as a law student to legal 
counsel for the EPA. Fisher said 
when he graduated law school, he 
faced a ping-pong game of legal 
career decisions, with opportunities 
popping up and being rescinded. 
Tom Mulholland, a Law School 
student who hopes to work in 
environmental law, said he found 
Fisher’s advice on career flexibility 
helpful.
“My main takeaway was to be 
flexible with the career, especially 
at first, because there are a lot of 
different people working on a lot 

of different environmental issues,” 
Mulholland said. “It’s okay to have 
a flexible mindset because then you 
can choose what issues to work on 
when you encounter those issues 
rather than having your mind 
made up beforehand.”
Fisher, who stressed his views 
do not represent those held by the 
EPA, commented on the future of 
climate change policy.
“There’s a lot of work to be done 
on climate change in government,” 
Fisher said. “A lot of it is going on 
in state governments all over the 
country. There are some really 
aggressive, forward-thinking state 

programs that will all be models 
for a potential federal legal regime 
once that finally comes in place.”
Some 
state 
programs 
are 
working 
in 
other 
areas 
of 
environmental 
protection, 
especially regarding safe drinking 
water. Fisher’s talk comes soon 
after the discovery of elevated 
levels of perfluoroalkyl substances 
(PFAS) in Kalamazoo County in 
2018 and the Flint water crisis in 
2014.

RYAN LITTLE/Daily
Members of the Native American Student Association give a presentation proposing the renaming of the Union’s southern lounge in honor of Native Americans at the Union Monday 
afternoon. 

LAW
From Page 1


According 
to 
the 
organization’s 
website, 
the 
Order of Angell is made up 
of “leaders from the many 
diverse corners of campus” 
and 
seeks 
to 
“promote 
interconnectedness 
at 
Michigan, develop leadership 
and engage in short and long-
term leadership projects.” 
At 
the 
meeting, 
NASA 
asked the University to take 
appropriate action by renaming 
the lounge and designating it 
as a space for NASA to gather 
and exclusively reserve for 
community 
events. 
Bowen 
said she believes the new 
Union 
renovation 
presents 
an 
important 
opportunity 
for the University to begin to 
repair the harm done over the 
years to the Native American 
community by the Order of 
Angell. 
“What we are asking is for 
the same level of permanence 
and priority that has been 
placed on James Angell and the 

Order over the years,” Bowen 
said.
In addition to Angell Hall 
named after Angell, a plaque 
outside the Union’s entrance 
commemorates 
the 
former 
University president. However, 
there is no place on campus 
dedicated 
solely 
to 
Native 
American students. 
Bowen discussed initiatives 
of 
other 
universities 
to 
acknowledge 
their 
Native 
American student population. 
Colleges including Michigan 
State University, University of 
California Berkeley, University 
of Minnesota and others all 
have spaces dedicated to the 
Native American community. 
“Clearly, it is not irregular 
to have a physical space for 
native and indigenous students 
on campus, especially at a 
university as large and as 
endowed 
as 
Michigan 
is,” 
Bowen said. 
Bowen 
also 
spoke 
about 
how Native Americans were 
instrumental in founding the 
University. In the 1817 Treaty 
of Fort Meigs, also called 
the Treaty of Fort Rapids, 

Native American tribes ceded 
their land to the University 
of 
Michigan. 
According 
to 
Bowen, this treaty was the 
beginning of University and 
Native American relations. 
By 
renaming 
the 
south 
lounge, 
Bowen 
said 
she 
believes the University could 
take an important, relatively 
simple 
and 
cost-free 
first 
step 
in 
recognizing 
and 
appreciating the role Native 
Americans played in allowing 
the University to exist. 
“We are more than just 
our histories but we have to 
actually 
make 
changes 
so 
that these histories are not 
forgotten,” Bowen said. “This is 
in no way an easy presentation 
to give. Nobody, no student 
and no student organization 
should ever feel like they have 
to justify their place on this 
campus or in the Union.” 
In the following Q&A portion 
of the event, Bowen addressed 
the logistics of the proposal. 
Since 
the 
Union 
closed 
for 
renovation, 
NASA 
has 
struggled to secure a regular 
meeting space. According to 

Bowen, multicultural rooms 
meant 
for 
many 
student 
organizations 
to 
use 
are 
often full and dominated by 
larger groups that meet more 
frequently. With the exception 
of November, which is Native 
American 
Heritage 
Month, 
NASA only books a meeting 
space a couple of times a month 
and doesn’t withhold study 
spaces from students. 
One 
question 
from 
the 
audience was geared towards 
the Board. In anticipation of 
the Union’s opening day in 
January, the Board invited 
NASA to be present at the 
ceremony. Later, the Board 
offered NASA the opportunity 
to present on what the Union 
could do to make NASA feel 
more included and represented. 
Amy White, director of the 
Union, 
said 
they 
invited 
NASA based on the need to 
recognize the history of racial 
discrimination associated with 
the Union. 
“Knowing the history of 
Michigamua in this space, and 
the harm that has been done 
over the years … that was what 

was behind the invitation — to 
acknowledge that a great deal 
of harm had been done to the 
community,” White said. 
Audience 
member 
Alan 
Haber also spoke up at the 
event. Haber, who enrolled 
in the University in 1954, is 
an activist and was the first 
president of Students for a 
Democratic Society which first 
met in Ann Arbor in 1960. 
Haber 
said 
the 
act 
of 
renaming 
would 
be 
representative of a restorative 
deed.
“Land 
that 
belonged 
to 
other people was taken as 
our own, us being settlers,” 
Haber said, referencing early 
colonization in America. “It 
seems 
important 
not 
only 
restoratively, but symbolically 
in the future to have some 
piece of land ceded back to the 
Native American community.”
Haber 
reiterated 
Bowen, 
stressing the need for a place 
on 
campus 
where 
Native 
Americans can celebrate their 
culture and be recognized by 
the University. 
White 
closed 
the 
event, 

thanking Bowen and NASA for 
the presentation and working 
with the Union to establish 
better relations. 
The Daily spoke with Bowen 
following 
the 
presentation. 
Overall, Bowen said she was 
pleased with how engaged 
and invested the Board was in 
creating a better environment 
where every student can feel 
represented. 
Bowen 
also 
thanked 
the 
students 
and 
community 
members 
that 
came to support her and NASA. 
“I’m glad that we had so 
much 
community 
support,” 
Bowen said. “This is an issue 
that is incredibly important to 
so many people and I’m glad 
that (the Board) seemed to hear 
it and take it very seriously. I’m 
looking forward to working 
with them to get this done.”
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
presentation, the Board did 
not give a final verdict and did 
not address when they would 
release a decision.

The 
One 
University 
Campaign 
(1U) 
launched 
in 2018 by a coalition of 
faculty and students to equip 
the 
U-M 
Flint 
and 
U-M 
Dearborn 
campuses 
with 
more resources. Achieving 
on-campus medical services 
in 
U-M 
Flint 
and 
U-M 
Dearborn 
is 
one 
of 
the 
campaign’s 
seven 
goals, 
which also include equalizing 
the Michigan Legislature’s 
per-student 
allocations 
and extending the Go Blue 
Guarantee to U-M Dearborn 
and U-M Flint campuses. 
Members of 1U from all 
three 
campuses 
continue 
to 
put 
pressure 
on 
the 
University’s 
administration 
to address these issues. At 
the Dec. 5, 2019 Regents 
meeting, 1U organizers and 
students 
involved 
in 
the 
Climate 
Action 
Movement 
addressed 
the 
Board 
of 
Regents 
about 
perceived 
inadequacies in funding and 
healthcare coverage, among 
other 
issues. 
The 
groups 
ultimately 
blockaded 
the 
entrances to the University 
Golf Course in protest against 
the University’s actions until 
they were moved by police.
Tyrice Denson, a recent 
U-M Flint graduate and 1U 
organizer, said socioeconomic 
disparities 
between 
the 
campuses 
put 
U-M 
Flint 
students in a tough position 
when most of them work jobs 
to cover tuition costs and 
often have to choose between 
going to class or going to the 
doctor.
“That can really burden 
students, even if, like, they 
have a really bad cold and 
probably shouldn’t be going to 
class,” Denson said. “Students 
have to decide whether they 
want to take a hit on their 
grade, force themselves to 
go to class sick or go to the 
doctor, get that doctor’s note 

and now have to deal with the 
medical bill.”
With 
median 
family 
incomes around half that of 
U-M Ann Arbor students, 
Darwish 
said 
the 
lack 
of 
University-sponsored 
healthcare on the U-M Flint 
and U-M Dearborn campuses 
is hard on many students. 
“In Dearborn, everybody is 
trying to support themselves 
and 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
healthcare issues, money just 
gets in the way,” Darwish said. 
“In Ann Arbor, not 
only do students 
have easy access 
to 
on-campus 
healthcare, but the 
population is a lot 
more 
wealthy 
so 
it’s a lot easier for 
them to get access 
and probably not 
work 
a 
job 
and 
focus more on their 
education.”
Denson 
connected 
the 
demand for more 
equitable 
health 
resources 
to 
the 
campaign’s broader 
mission. 
“One University 
as a whole is about providing 
more equitable resources for 
all University of Michigan 
students,” 
Denson 
said. 
“We are one of the most 
prestigious universities in the 
world, and there are certain 
things we should just provide 
for our students. If students in 
Ann Arbor are provided these 
resources, then students in 
Dearborn and Flint should be 
as well.”
On Jan. 31, U-M Dearborn’s 
student 
government 
unanimously 
passed 
a 
resolution supporting the 1U 
campaign and its platform, 
including 
a 
demand 
for 
student 
medical 
services. 
Amanda Saleh, vice president 
of U-M Dearborn Student 
Government, wrote to The 
Daily that students at U-M 
Dearborn do not have access 

to 
an 
exclusive 
medical 
professional 
or 
a 
nurse 
practitioner, 
which 
limits 
access to mental health and 
sexual health services like 
those available to students at 
the Ann Arbor campus. 
Saleh also wrote in an email 
that the resolution is a step 
in the right direction given 
U-M Dearborn’s “history of 
being shy when it comes to 
demands.” 
“We 
hope 
that 
this 
resolution 
urges 
the 

conversation 
within 
administration 
to 
look 
further into the need of health 
services for our students,” 
Saleh wrote. “With health 
care services on our campus, 
students will not only have 
access 
to 
much-needed 
resources, but they will be 
able to do so independently 
of their parents’ insurance, 
which is crucial for folks who 
would not be able to receive 
help otherwise.”
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim Broekhuizen responded 
to The Daily’s request for 
comment on 1U’s medical 
services 
with 
information 
from the University website. 
The 
University’s 
website 
says the student fees charged 
to each student on the Ann 
Arbor campus support UHS.
“It’s 
not 
clear 
that 

students at UM-Flint and 
UM-Dearborn 
experience 
the same level of need on 
their campuses to support 
these efforts through added 
fees 
they 
would 
incur,” 
Broekhuizen wrote.
Broekhuizen 
also 
highlighted 
differences 
between the campus’s student 
bodies. 
She 
noted 
that 
Ann Arbor is a residential 
educational community with 
nearly 100 percent of its 
freshmen living in campus 

housing, while U-M Flint 
and 
U-M 
Dearborn 
are 
mostly commuter campuses. 
Broekhuizen also wrote that 
given the high percentage of 
commuter students compared 
to the Ann Arbor campus, 
“most 
regional 
campus 
students already have well-
established relationships with 
local health care providers 
and receive their care in that 
manner.”
In 
a 
November 
2019 
interview with The Daily, 
University President Mark 
Schlissel said the U-M Flint 
and U-M Dearborn campuses 
receive 
less 
money 
from 
the state and their students 
compared 
to 
the 
Ann 
Arbor campus, leading to 
fewer available campus-wide 
resources.
“I don’t think Flint and 

Dearborn have less funding 
because their students come 
from 
lower 
socioeconomic 
communities,” 
Schlissel 
said. “I think they have less 
funding because they get 
less money from the state, 
they collect less tuition from 
their students, they don’t 
have nearly the philanthropy 
Ann Arbor has and instead 
of being 200 years old, with 
hundreds of years to develop 
the support that and the 
infrastructure the University 
has, they’re 50 years 
old.”
Students 
on 
all 
three 
campuses, 
however, 
voiced 
concern 
about 
the lack of health 
resources 
on 
the 
U-M Flint and U-M 
Dearborn campuses. 
Darwish said many of 
his friends are out-of-
state or international 
students, 
which 
means they cannot 
always 
rely 
on 
healthcare providers 
in the immediate area 
to receive care. 
“Just because it’s 
a 
smaller 
school 
with a higher percent of 
people from the area, you 
can’t 
just 
generalize 
and 
exclude that other population 
of people that don’t have 
access,” 
Darwish 
said. 
“I 
couldn’t imagine being an 
international 
student 
and 
having an easy time finding 
health care here.”
LSA senior Tyler Ziel, a 
transfer student from U- M 
Dearborn, 
researched 
the 
health disparities between 
the campuses last summer. 
According to Ziel, both U-M 
Dearborn 
and 
U-M 
Flint 
used to have formal referral 
partnerships 
with 
local 
healthcare 
providers, 
but 
they were discontinued due 
to low usage. As a student on 
both the U-M Ann Arbor and 
U-M 
Dearborn 
campuses, 
Ziel reflected on the impact 

healthcare can have on the 
student body.
“Since 
we 
are 
a 
state 
university, 
our 
job 
is 
to 
provide 
for 
the 
local 
community and for students’ 
educations,” Ziel said. “But 
the students need to be able 
to survive and be healthy 
in order to actually get that 
education … There’s a moral 
duty aspect to provide for 
your fellow students because 
we’re all Wolverines.” 
Sara Alqaragholy, recent 
graduate of U-M Dearborn 
and organizer of 1U, said 
U-M 
Dearborn 
Student 
Government Representatives 
met with Amy Finley, dean 
of students at U-M Dearborn, 
last fall to present data on the 
need for medical services.
“I’m very hopeful that if 
(the) administration thinks 
in 
numbers 
and 
we’re 
providing the data around our 
demographics and funding, 
and we display a need (of 
medical services), then they 
should be listening to us,” 
Alqaragholy said. “If so many 
students are in need of them, 
it just makes sense.”
When 
asked 
about 
the 
low usage of past healthcare 
partnerships, 
Ziel 
and 
Denson 
pointed 
to 
poor 
advertising at both U-M Flint 
and U-M Dearborn. Denison 
said most students were not 
aware of the partnerships and 
the administration should not 
rely on low usage rates in the 
past when evaluating how to 
best provide health services 
for the future. 
“Regardless of what the 
numbers show how often 
something is used, it is clear 
to anyone that there’s a need 
here 
for 
Flint 
students,” 
Denison said. “The University 
really does have an obligation 
for services better than they 
currently are.”

LSA senior Sage Renstrom-
Richards is a computer science 
major who left the RC because 
she 
couldn’t 
fit 
the 
extra 
requirements into her schedule. 
She said it was difficult to 
handle the RC requirements 
since she had to fulfill LSA 
distribution requirements and 
the requirements for her major. 
“I wanted to have the freedom 
just to choose other classes that 
I was interested in,” Renstrom-
Richards said. “Even if people 
have the room in their schedules 
to fit it in, just having a longer 
list of requirements makes the 
flexibility a lot more constrained.” 
The RC offers five intensive 
programs: 
Spanish, 
French, 
German, Russian and Japanese. 
However, students may choose a 
different language through LSA 
as long as it is not already offered 
by the RC. 
On top of meeting the LSA 
language 
requirement, 
RC 
students 
must 
complete 
an 
advanced readings course in 
that language. All RC intensive 
languages meet twice a day four 

days per week to provide students 
with an immersive experience, 
including mandatory language 
lunch tables to help students build 
their communication skills. 
According to Badgley, students 
may choose to leave the program 
early primarily due to the cost 
of housing and the intensive 
language program requirements. 
“The folks leaving after the first 
year are often leaving because the 
residency requirement requires 
an expensive commitment to 
both the housing and the meal 
plan,” 
Badgley 
said. 
“That’s 
difficult for people depending 
on 
their 
family 
budgets. 
Some students do not wish to 
complete the intensive language 
requirement, although LSA also 
has a language requirement, but 
it’s not as intensive as it is here in 
the Residential College.”
Badgley also said graduating 
seniors often forget about or 
decide not to complete the four 
course requirements for non-RC 
majors. 
Badgley 
noted 
many 
RC 
classes satisfy the distribution 
requirements for LSA. For that 
reason, she said she doesn’t 
consider it a heavy burden. 
However, Badgley said finishing 

all of the RC requirements can be 
difficult for students who try to 
complete more than one major.
According 
to 
statistics 
provided to The Daily by Charlie 
Murphy, director of RC Academic 
Services, 47 percent of students 
of the 2018 RC graduating class 
completed more than one major. 
“One trend that we have 
seen is that more and more 
students are either doing double 
majors or are doing majors plus 
a minor,” Badgley said. “That 
means they have many more 
course requirements in their 
concentration, and that may be 
putting 
pressure 
on 
the 
four 
course 
requirement for the Residential 
College if those courses are not 
in some way contributing to their 
concentrations.”
Badgley 
also 
noted 
other 
professional 
schools 
at 
the 
University of Michigan have 
increased their undergraduate 
program 
offerings. 
Many 
of 
these programs, such as the 
Ford School of Public Policy, 
students are accepted during as 
sophomores and begin taking 
classes as juniors, and this could 
be another reason students drop 
the program.
LSA senior Brandon Bond 

plans to graduate with an RC 
degree. He said some people have 
beliefs about the RC that could 
make it a less attractive option for 
incoming students. 
“We have the reputation for 
being the ‘weird’ kids,” Bond 
said. “That goes a lot into the 
recruitment 
(and) 
retention. 
People don’t want to be associated 
with being the ‘other crowd’ or 
the ‘other community.’”
LSA senior Kate Puca also 
plans on graduating with an RC 
degree and said she has heard 
of this stigma. She said the 
stereotype is often brought up 
when she introduces herself.
“There is definitely that stigma 
that RC people are weird, and 
I think that discourages a lot of 
people from continuing with it,” 
Puca said. “Ross has a stigma, 
Engineering has a stigma to it. 
Depending on what your path 
is, people are going to label and 
stereotype you in a certain way.”
Bond and Puca both disagree 
with this stereotype. Bond said 
he is extremely grateful for the 
RC program and he loves the 
community the program has 
built. 
“From my perspective, it’s just 
people who want to be as true 

to themselves, and as honest 
and open about themselves as 
possible,” Bond said. “The RC 
does an amazing job at creating 
a 
community 
where 
people 
do genuinely feel comfortable 
expressing that.”
Bond also said East Quad is a 
prime location for many students. 
According to Bond, many people 
choose to participate in the RC 
program because students know 
they are guaranteed Central 
Campus housing for their first 
two years. 
Puca said proximity to campus 
was one of the reasons she 
initially joined the RC program. 
However, she stayed because 
she found the intensive language 
program helpful towards her 
Spanish minor and enjoyed the 
community. 
“That’s why I originally did it 
too, to be honest … I know a lot of 
people (who did it for housing),” 
Puca said, “It’s just that East Quad 
is so close to campus, and they 
were afraid of being put on North 
Campus that they opted into RC 
and then dropped it.”
Badgley said RC staff is working 
to fight the attrition rate by 
making some of the requirements 
more flexible.

“We are aware of students 
needing support within the 
language program, and we’ve 
increased the number of peer 
tutors 
who 
help 
students 
during 
these 
intensive 
languages,” Badgley said. “As 
far as the live-in requirement 
for the second year, there is 
a petition waiver, so it’s not 
an absolute. When a petition 
is submitted to waive that 
second-year 
requirement, 
the deciding body takes a 
close look at the student’s 
financial needs and other 
considerations. We’re trying 
to make it flexible.”
Even though many students 
do 
not 
complete 
the 
RC 
program, Badgley said the RC 
program is still thriving.
“The students who declare 
an interest in the Residential 
College 
and 
who 
actually 
arrive here have increased in 
the last two years, and they 
show every sign, this year, 
of increasing even further,” 
Badgley said.

A need for local action on employment discrimination
W

ith 
the 
Equality 
Act (H.R.5) stalled 
in 
Congress 
and 
a combined lack of political 
will, local action on LGBTQ+ 
employment 
discrimination 
is 
imperative. Currently, 44 percent 
of 
the 
LGBTQ+ 
population 
lives in states without LGBTQ+ 
protection 
policies 
despite 
exclusionary workplaces holding 
economies back. The Judiciary 
has shifted to the ideological right 
under President Donald Trump, 
resulting in the elimination of a 
route for employment protections. 
In lieu of federal action on the issue 
of employment discrimination, 
state 
and 
local 
governments 
must act to safeguard LGBTQ+ 
individuals and promote economic 
development. 
The federal government and 
26 states do not have employment 
protections 
for 
LGBTQ+ 
individuals, resulting in second-
class status for LGBTQ+ citizens. 
One in four LGBTQ+-identifying 
persons reported experiencing 
workplace 
discrimination 
in 
2016 and too often they stand 
unprotected and vulnerable. The 
community feels vulnerable due 
to the frequent targeting from 
majority groups and a lack of 
protection under the law. With 
nearly one-third of transgender 
individuals living in poverty, 
40 percent of homeless youth 
identifying as LGBTQ+ and one 
in five members of the community 
falling victim to hate crimes, the 
national government is failing. 
Local protections for LGBTQ+ 
individuals are the best route 
toward safety and equality in the 
absence of federal action. With 
protections in place, everyone 
benefits from a healthy and 
productive workforce.
The 
push 
for 
LGBTQ+ 
employment 
protections 
in 
Michigan for state employees 
was progressed by Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer 
after 
signing 
an 
executive order, but it did not 
extend 
to 
all 
employees 
in 
Michigan. With a Republican 
majority 
in 
the 
Michigan 
Legislature, Whitmer is limited 
in her ability to enact policies. 
Therefore, 
local 
governments 
must step up or a massive recall 
must take place in the coming 
elections to supplement the lack of 
unilateral power Whitmer holds. 

In either scenario, the conversation 
for 
protections 
of 
LGBTQ+ 
individuals 
in 
the 
workplace 
must take place in neighborhoods 
and over the dinner table to be 
reflected across the state. 
Currently, 
20 
Michigan 
cities 
have 
added 
LGBTQ+-
identifying individuals to the 
list of protected groups in cases 
of employment discrimination. 
This group of Michigan cities 
sits alongside the less than 300 
other cities and counties with 
ordinances protecting LGBTQ+ 
individuals 
from 
workplace 
discrimination. 
This 
coalition 
is largely concentrated in states 
with existing protections but 
provides safe environments for 
LGBTQ+ 
individuals. 
Despite 
the progress made, many of the 
cities 
with 
local 
protections 
have religious exclusions and 
allow 
for 
discrimination 
by 
religious organizations. Religious 
exemptions create hierarchical 
structures 
where 
LGBTQ+ 
individuals feel vulnerable and 
ostracized by spaces traditionally 
deemed safe and welcoming. 
Critics often cite moral and 
religious 
arguments 
against 
inclusion in the workplace for 
LGBTQ+ individuals but ignore 
the 
economic 
benefits. 
The 
exclusion of LGBTQ+ people in 
the workplace causes harm to 
economies; The addition of legal 
rights for LGBTQ+ individuals is 
associated with higher levels of 
economic development. On top 
of economic benefits, visibility 
and familiarity with the LGBTQ+ 
community in the workplace leads 
to acceptance, supporting work 
communities. 
As the Equality Act remains 
untouched by Senate Majority 
Leader Mitch McConnell, the 
protections 
that 
LGBTQ+-
identifying 
individuals 
rely 
on in the workplace must be 
implemented from the bottom-
up. This bottom-up strategy relies 
on voters to focus on down-ballot 
races and pay attention to the 
candidates that have committed 
to 
protecting 
and 
uplifting 
at-risk groups like the LGBTQ+ 
community. It is imperative for 
voters to exercise empathy and 
protect their neighbors from 
discrimination in the workplace 
to ensure equal opportunity under 
the law. 

In addition to all the races 
voters must pay attention to, the 
focus also must shift to the courts 
and how the Senate and White 
House dictate the makeup of the 
Judiciary across the country. 
Many ignore the power that 
the Executive has in appointing 
judges and justices from Appellate 
to Supreme Courts. Trump has 
now nominated and received 
confirmation by the Senate on 
over 187 lifetime judges resulting 
in one in every five circuit judges 
being Trump-nominated. In line 
with the need for employment 
protections, 
the 
conservative 
majority Supreme Court of the 
United States is in the process 
of deciding on a trio of cases 
pertaining 
to 
employment 
protections 
for 
LGBTQ+ 
individuals at the federal level. 
The lineup of lifetime appointed 
conservative-leaning judges and 
justices across the country is a 
cause for concern for employment 
activists due to the closing of the 
avenue so often used for minority 
groups. Voters must recognize 
that up and down the ballot, they 
have responsibilities to vote for 
values and vote for their LGBTQ+ 
neighbors, friends and families 
while the war on the community 
wages on. It is important to be 
educated on the severity and 
responsibility of every office on 
the ballot but to also vote for your 
principles rather than focusing 
on candidates at face value. Many 
voters are trapped in the mindset 
that candidates matter more than 
their politics, but those threatened 
by a lack of action aren’t afforded 
this privilege. LGBTQ+ individuals 
feel the effects of political inaction 
everyday inside and outside the 
workplace as their day-to-day lives 
are threatened.
Local 
ordinances 
and 
protections are just the starting 
point for LGBTQ+ individuals, 
rather than the destination. With 
integrated workplaces and stronger 
coalitions at the local and state level, 
pressure in the form of advocacy 
will implore the federal government 
to act. While Congress remains in 
gridlock, LGBTQ+ lives and careers 
must be protected at local levels 
to ensure equal opportunity and 
economic prosperity.

Using education to combat hate
A

s we grapple with a 
divided 
nation 
and 
increasing 
instances 
of hate and tribalism, we need 
to increase our commitment 
to education about the past to 
create a more compassionate 
future. On Jan. 27, the world 
marked International Holocaust 
Remembrance Day. This year 
was especially poignant as it 
was the 75th anniversary of the 
liberation of the Auschwitz-
Birkenau concentration camp 
and the end of one of the 
darkest 
periods 
in 
modern 
history. In honor of this day 
and as a reaction to recent acts 
of anti-Semitism, the House 
of Representatives passed a 
bipartisan bill called the “Never 
Again Education Act” to help 
encourage 
schools 
to 
teach 
Holocaust education. This bill 
grants $10 million to the U.S. 
Holocaust Memorial Museum 
over a five year period. The 
museum must provide educators 
with resources and materials 
in the hopes of counteracting 
the rising tide of anti-Semitic 
violence around the world by 
teaching students. This bill is an 
important first step that should 
serve as a launching point 
for larger efforts to integrate 
teachings about the Holocaust 
and other genocides, such as 
the Armenian genocide, the 
genocide in Darfur and the 
current situation with Rohingya 
Muslims in Myanmar. 
The decision about whether 
to teach about these events is 
largely up to individual teachers 
or school districts. Only 11 states, 
Michigan included, have any 
requirement that information 
about the Holocaust be taught 
in schools, and only 15 states 
require some education on the 
Armenian genocide.
Failing to effectively teach 
youth about these issues can 
lead to a shocking lack of 
knowledge about these events. 
In the case of the Holocaust, 
recent research has proven 
this to be frighteningly the 

case. A study from 2019 found 
that 41 percent of millennials 
believe around four million 
Jews were murdered in the 
Holocaust, 
drastically 
less 
than the six million actually 
killed. Additionally, 66 percent 
of millennials cannot explain 
what 
Auschwitz 
was 
nor 
what it did. This is extremely 
concerning because, without an 
accurate understanding of what 
happened in the past, people 
cannot work to avoid the same 
mistakes in the future. How 
can we say “never again” with 
confidence if many people do 
not know what happened in the 
first place? As the years since the 
Holocaust and other genocides 
pass, it can be easy to get 
complacent. We begin to forget 
the true horror of these events, 
and we slip back into certain “us 
versus them” mentalities that lie 
at the root of these tragedies. 

Over the past few years, we 
have seen a rapid increase in 
hate crimes, whether it is anti-
Semitic attacks, anti-LGBTQ+ 
community attacks or increases 
in white nationalism. For many 
University of Michigan students, 
these issues are personal. We are 
an extremely diverse community 
with students of different races, 
religions, 
backgrounds 
and 
sexual orientations. 
It 
is 
undeniable 
that 
education is not a foolproof 
solution to these problems. 
The visceral hate and anger 
that 
fuels 
attacks 
such 
as 
these cannot be solved simply 
through education. However, 
education 
about 
genocides 

and other tragic events where 
hate led to conflict help us to 
understand the fragility of 
society and the importance of 
constantly cultivating a culture 
of inclusiveness and respect. 
Through learning, we can see 
the danger of fear, prejudice 
and hate and we can recognize 
how 
everyday 
people 
can 
choose to stand up to forces of 
hate and bigotry.
I was fortunate to grow up in 
a community and attend a school 
where 
education 
about 
the 
Holocaust and other atrocities 
was extremely comprehensive. 
My school tried to integrate this 
education into multiple facets 
of our educational experience. 
Not only did we learn the facts 
in history class, but we read 
first-hand accounts, such as the 
book “Night,” in English class 
and had discussions about hate 
and discrimination in various 
settings. This teaching style 
was so effective because it 
allowed us to see these events 
not simply as a piece of history 
but as something that needed 
to be constantly addressed and 
understood. This is especially 
important for young people 
for whom the events of past 
tragedies feel far removed from 
many of their lives. 
As students, we have an 
obligation to continue to try to 
foster a culture of tolerance on 
campus and beyond. Whether it 
is by accepting the differences 
of others or voicing support for 
legislation similar to the Never 
Again Education Act, we all have 
a duty to do our part to create 
a compassionate community. 
We should also commit to 
increasing our understanding 
of these events. Whether it is 
reading about past genocides or 
raising awareness about current 
atrocities, we all have a part to 
play in becoming more educated 
and contributing to a more 
inclusive environment.

Boyan Slat’s work needs media coverage

T

he conversation around the 
climate crisis in the United 
States lacks substance and 
instead focuses on sensationalized 
activism. 
Social 
activists 
are 
receiving 
more 
coverage 
and 
popularity than the engineers and 
innovators designing real solutions 
to the existential problems we face. 
While Greta Thunberg was named 
Time Magazine’s Person of the Year 
in 2019 for her social activism, Boyan 
Slat is receiving little recognition 
for single-handedly taking on the 
responsibility of cleaning up 90 
percent of the plastic pollution in 
the Pacific Ocean. Slat designed 
the world’s first maritime plastic 
cleanup system, The Ocean Cleanup, 
yet Thunberg and her celebrity 
activism take center stage in the 
realms of media and politics. Real 
innovators should be championed 
and celebrated. Boyan Slat is solving 
one of the most complex problems of 
our generation despite few knowing 
about him.
Plastics 
and 
derivative 
microplastics have accumulated in 
dangerous quantities throughout 
the ocean, having an adverse impact 
on the health of complex marine 
ecosystems, 
and 
consequently, 
humans. Most of this plastic 
pollution is concentrated in the Great 
Pacific Garbage Patch, a massive 
area now twice the size of Texas. 
Undoubtedly the consequence of 
human negligence, the monstrous 
rate of world pollution is only getting 
worse. Higher-income countries 
have successful waste management 
systems and therefore contribute less 
to the pollution in the oceans. Ninety 
percent of ocean plastic pollution 
comes from just 10 rivers, eight of 
which run through Asia, bordering 
poorer villages that lack the proper 
waste management infrastructure. 
Many countries are at a stage 
in development where people 
are wealthy enough to consume 
plastic goods or goods wrapped 
in plastic, but there isn’t sufficient 
waste infrastructure to deal with 
the situation effectively. People 
dump their waste into the local 
rivers because it’s the easiest 
method of disposal. With high 
densities of people around major 
rivers, trash accumulates and 

flows 
through 
these 
arteries 
into the ocean, where the plastic 
ultimately remains. Importantly, 
it isn’t that people don’t care about 
the environment or are somehow 
less civilized. The reality is 
there is a large number of people 
consuming plastic goods while 
there is no infrastructure for 
effective disposal.
Little has been done to address 
plastic waste in the Pacific 
Ocean or the efficacy of waste 
management until recently; few 
know of its existence. Boyan 
Slat is taking the issue head-on 
and plans to permanently end 
plastic pollution in the oceans. 
Slat’s approach is two-sided. 
While Slat is working to clean 
up the existing plastic pollution 
in the ocean, he is also working 
to address the issue at the source 
with 
“interceptor” 
systems 
that catch plastic at the river 
source. Currently, with working 
prototype systems, Slat plans 
on expanding his fleet of ocean 
cleanup systems to 60 in order 
to reach his goal of reducing the 
amount of plastic in the Great 
Pacific Garbage Patch in half by 
2025. Slat’s company, the Ocean 
Cleanup Project, is saving the 
ocean, and can’t even gain an 
audience. 
In 
such 
a 
dysfunctional 
political climate — where little 
environmental legislation has 
any chance of enactment — 
such technological innovations 
should be championed and 
celebrated, but they aren’t. 
Climate change is a political 
issue and it attracts a lot of 
media and political attention. 
But this attention is focused 
around 
superficial 
ideas 
and moral activism instead 
of coverage of the practical 
solutions 
to 
the 
very 
real 
problems we face. Slat’s lack of 
fame isn’t a fluke; It’s a symptom 
of sensationalized news and 
token climate activists getting 
more coverage than those on 
the ground fixing the problems 
of our generation. 
This is not to say that 
celebrity climate activists such 
as Leonardo DiCaprio or Greta 

Thunberg don’t play a critical 
role in enacting change. In fact, 
Thunberg addressed heads of 
state at the United Nations and 
inspired four million people to 
participate in the largest climate 
demonstration in history. She 
captured the frustration and 
anger of the millions of young 
people who carry the burden 
of 
inheriting 
dysfunctional 
governments in the face of the 
global climate crisis. That being 
said, Thunberg’s activism has 
made little substantive change 
in international climate policy 
as many governments still don’t 
care enough, especially the U.S.
Rather than being seen as 
a climate activist pushing for 
rapid reform, Thunberg has 
become adopted as a political 
lightning rod. The political left 
uses her as an anti-Trump totem 
while the political right uses her 
to support their “crazy socialist” 
narrative. The result of all this 
sensationalized 
coverage 
is 
that token activists get more 
coverage than those on the front 
lines treating the symptoms of 
the climate crisis. Slat, and many 
like him, need media coverage 
to promote investment. This is 
precisely where social activism 
and innovative problem-solving 
overlap. To promote innovative 
solutions, we need to start 
championing the designers and 
the engineers just as much, if 
not more than the lead social 
activists. 
The climate crisis needs real 
solutions. Activism has a key 
role to play in saving the climate 
and protecting human well-
being, but it won’t get anything 
done 
unless 
it’s 
targeted 
towards 
concrete 
solutions. 
Instead of carrying a sign that 
claims the world is burning — 
even though it is — carry a sign 
that points to a solution. “Invest 
in Boyan Slat” is tangible and 
can be echoed by the media 
or addressed by politicians. It 
would also look great on a picket 
sign.

Anyone 
who’s 
ever 
improvised a piece of music, 
character bit or comedy skit 
knows it’s mind-over-matter 
magic when it works. This 
seems to be what gets acclaimed 
director Jim Jarmusch onstage 
with producer pal Carter Logan 
in the formation of SQURL, an 
enthusiastic-if-intermittent 
two-man act. The two visited 
the 
Michigan 
Theater 
last 
Tuesday to perform a score 
featuring drums, electric guitar 
and a range of synth and reverb 
devices over ’20s short films by 
the surrealist Man Ray.
Jarmusch 
was 
the 
main 
draw for most folks. His movies 
have captivated U.S. audiences 
with their seemingly foreign 
glimpses into American life. 
His 
suave 
appearance 
and 
triangular prism-shaped hair 
indicate a young, metropolitan 
sensibility, hiding any trace of 
his rural Ohio upbringing.
Considering his films and 
music, though, it makes sense 
that 
such 
an 
upbringing 
would 
be 
used 
as 
fodder. 
“Stranger Than Paradise” is 
a 
minimalistically-compact 
demonstration of our inability 
to ever connect to one another. 
A 20-something New Yorker, 
his friend and an initially 
unwelcome 
younger 
cousin 
spend days idly running errands, 
watching 
TV 
and 
sharing 
thoughts. The cousins warm 
to each other in subtle ways as 
they commit to breaking from 
their daily malaise, but end up 
even further apart by film’s end. 

This lack of understanding 
could also be what draws 
Jarmusch 
to 
Man 
Ray’s 
surrealist films, which feel 
like automatic manifestations 
of 
his 
subconscious 
mind. 
Newspapers rustling in the 
wind, 
an 
indistinguishable 
man tucking a woman into 
bed, a closeup of some fibrous 
material splitting down the 
middle. All these interrupted by 
intermittent slides of stream of 
consciousness thought: “if the 
flowers were in glass,” “a throw 
of the dice will never abolish 
chance.” Sitting through them 
puts you in a trance, unable to 
grab onto any one detail over 
another until the screen reads 
“You are not dreaming” and you 
snap out of it.
At the end of the live show, 
Jarmusch explained that these 
shorts were never scored and 
typically supplemented by jazz 
tunes of their time. Though both 
art forms were experimenting 
with improv and chance, he and 
Logan saw much more potential 
for the films in the powerful 
combination 
of 
analog 
and 
digital music tech. 
Really, though, they saw an 
opportunity to have the same 
fun Man Ray did in making 
his films. With nothing too 
literal on the screen, it seems 
hard to make mistakes. Logan 
explained their process after 
the show: one initial watch-
through 
to 
internalize 
a 
reaction, and several more with 
instruments to establish maps 
of where to change keys and so 
on. 
For the three minutes of 
eclectic moving shots of clocks, 
nails, and paint splatter that is 
“Le Retour a la Raison” (The 

Return 
to 
Reason), 
Logan 
pounded his bass drum while 
adjusting some static-inducing 
knob. Jarmusch sent long notes 
off his electric guitar into the 
ether.
The 
slower-burning 
“Les 
Mystères du Château de Dé” 
professed to be about two 
Parisians’ visit to a castle in 
the countryside. This “castle” 
was really just a Le Corbusier-
esque Modern home Man Ray 
dubiously labels “prestigious.” 
The plot is just a group of 
characters playing in the pool 
and with various toys they find 
throughout. They often roll dice 
to decide whether or not to do 
something. The effect really 
strips the meaning of much 
of what bourgeois living was 
about. 
As this film, the last of the 
show and the longest at 27 
minutes, 
played, 
Jarmusch 
often turned to face the screen 
on 
his 
guitar. 
Completely 
absorbed in visuals and sound, 
he lunged back from the screen, 
openly reacting. “Music is a real 
release for me,” he said at the 
end of the show.
The 
meaning-stripping 
done Tuesday night is a theme 
in Jarmusch’s body of work. 
For the next three Tuesdays, 
the Michigan Theater will be 
featuring some of his most 
acclaimed films: “Down By 
Law” on the 11, “Gimme Danger” 
on the 18, and “Only Lovers 
Left Alive” on the 25. Though 
often deadpan and desolate, 
these films acknowledge the 
difficulty of representing the 
multitudes contained within 
their characters, and leave an 
impression on audiences well 
after their reels have run.

This review contains spoilers.
You may find that shows 
as long-running as “Brooklyn 
Nine-Nine” tend to be formulaic, 
often forcing their protagonists 
to go through radical changes or 
obstacles that ultimately force 
personal growth onto them. 
“Brooklyn Nine-Nine” is no 

different, but the season seven 
premiere offers a refreshing 
twist 
compared 
to 
the 
development of the protagonists 
during the previous seasons.
In the season six finale 
of 
“Brooklyn 
Nine-Nine,” 
Captain Raymond Holt (Andre 
Braugher, “Bojack Horseman”) 
finds himself demoted from 
the rank of officer to beat cop. 
Initially, you might find this 
shift in power to be less drastic 
compared to the incarcerations 

of Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg, 
“Palm Springs”) and Rosa Diaz 
(Stephanie 
Beatriz, 
“Bob’s 
Burgers”) during the season 
four finale. Yet the removal of 
a father-like figure from his 
position of power presents a 
window of opportunity: Have 
the 
other 
protagonists 
of 
“Brooklyn Nine-Nine” changed 
and matured enough to handle 
the vacuum of power that has 
remained constant over the 
previous six seasons?

You’ll find that in the 
first episode of season seven, 
“Manhunter,” 
Jake 
Peralta 
becomes 
a 
full-fledged, 
competent 
detective 
capable 
of leading a manhunt — a vast 
improvement compared to his 
lazy season one counterpart 
who is constantly berated by his 
superiors. In stark contrast, Holt 
finds himself in a depressive rut 
due to his demoted rank. 
During the manhunt of an 
assassin, 
Holt 
attempts 
to 
commandeer his former protégé 
Jake’s 
investigation, 
finding 
himself unable to swallow his 
own pride and follow the orders 
of his former subordinate. Holt’s 
subordination leaves him to 
follow his intuition, which runs 
contrary to Jake’s conclusion 
that leads to the arrest of the 
accomplice 
of 
the 
murder. 
Holt’s 
intuition 
ultimately 
leads to the arrest of the true 
assassin alongside the assassin’s 
accomplice. Through the arrest, 
Holt and Jake both learn that 
trusting their respective talents, 
skills and intuitions is far more 
important than the arbitrary 
label given to their relationship 
within the hierarchical police 
force. 
You 
hope 
that 
the 
upheaval of Holt’s relationship 
to his subordinates might lead to 
a positive reflection and change 
in his own character.
Yet those hopes are dashed 
in the second episode of season 
seven, “Captain Kim.” Captain 
Kim (Nicole Bilderback, “Staged 
Killer”), has been brought in 
to replace the former Captain 
Holt for the duration of his 
year-long 
demotion. 
The 

childish antics of Jake and 
Holt, who are convinced that 
the benevolent Captain Kim 
has ulterior motives, make you 
question whether Holt or Jake 
have learned anything from the 
previous episode. Ultimately, 
Captain 
Kim 
requests 
an 
immediate 
transfer 
away 
from the 99th Precinct. The 
captain’s 
responsibility 
then 
falls on the next highest ranking 
commander — Lieutenant Terry 
Jeffords (Terry Crews, “John 
Henry”). 

Terry Jeffords’ arc during 
the 
events 
of 
“Manhunter” 
and “Captain Kim” provide 
a perfect complement to the 
front seat antics of Jake and 
Holt. In “Manhunter,” Terry’s 
insecurities 
about 
receiving 
increased responsibility in the 

light of Holt’s demotion is played 
to comedic effect — he assumes 
that everyone is talking about 
his inadequacies behind his 
back. Terry ultimately accepts 
at the end of “Manhunter” that 
his best efforts matter as much 
as his leadership, regardless 
of whether his efforts are 
imperfect.
Yet in “Captain Kim,” Terry’s 
run-in with a former convict 
who he convicted reveals that he 
still has much to learn even as a 
leader — namely that of trust and 
empathy. Terry’s weaknesses 
as a leader are laid bare in the 
form of social embarrassment as 
Terry fails to hide his suspicion 
that the former convict might 
poison Terry. Though Terry’s 
embarrassment is portrayed in 
a humorous light, you wonder 
about the writers’ intentions 
for the relationship between the 
ex-convict and Terry. Are the 
writers attempting to underscore 
society’s unwavering disdain 
toward formerly incarcerated 
individuals 
attempting 
to 
integrate 
within 
society 
through humor? You remain 
unsure because Terry’s negative 
reactions and embarrassment 
toward the convict are second-
fiddle to the outlandish antics of 
Jake and Holt. 
With 
the 
departure 
of 
“The Good Place”, “Brooklyn 
Nine-Nine” sadly remains the 
only Michael Schur written 
comedy currently on the air. 
However, 
the 
season 
seven 
premiere provides the promise 
of continued positive character 
development for your beloved 
characters at the 99th precinct.

‘Nine-Nine’ wraps up with 
genuine character growth

Everyone knows a horse girl. 
They stash their homework in 
colorful horse folders, gallop 
their way through recess and 
talk about equestrian practice 
at every opportunity. It’s such a 
stereotype that Urban Dictionary 
has twenty six definitions of the 
term. However harmless this 
teasing may seem, though, “Horse 
Girl,” the new film from Jeff 
Baena (“The Little Hours”) and 
Allison Brie (“Glow”), shows that 
one never knows what might lurk 
behind those tacky horse T-shirts. 
“Horse 
Girl” 
begins 
by 
exploring the quirky life of 
Sarah, the titular Horse Girl, 
played by Brie. She works at a 
craft store, where the fantastic 
Molly 
Shannon 
(“Superstar”) 
plays her boss. Then Sarah goes 
to Zumba class, hangs around a 
stable (where she neither works 
nor takes lessons) a little too 
often and spends her nights alone 
watching Purgatory, a cheesy 
television 
show 
somewhere 
between 
“Criminal 
Minds” 
and 
“Supernatural.” 
On 
her 
birthday, Sarah is pressured by 
her roommate, played by Debby 
Ryan (“Insatiable”), to go on a 
date. The expected Horse Girl 
hijinks ensue as Sarah gets drunk, 
gallops on the dance floor and 
gets a nosebleed, yet somehow 
still woos the boy.
However banal all of this may 
seem, the fact that Sarah’s favorite 
show is called “Purgatory” is an 
early hint for what is to come. 
Sarah, like many people in 
America today, lives on a razor 

thin line between innocuous 
tedium and deranged chaos. Soon, 
this balance begins to fall apart. 
Sarah hears voices at night 
when nobody is home. She wakes 
up in strange places with no 
recollection of how she got there. 
She becomes certain that people 
from her dreams are trying to 
tell her something in real life. 

Reasons for this are hinted at, 
but to say any more would be a 
spoiler. As Sarah loses control, 
the narrative follows suit, with 
comedic tropes falling away to 
insane, 
terrifying 
surreality. 
“Horse Girl” has a remarkable 
shift from light comedy to head-
spinning 
psychological 
thrills 
that most films wouldn’t be able 
to pull off. 
It’s a risky move, but it succeeds 
because of Brie’s performance. 
She is entirely convincing in 
every scene and, no matter how 
unhinged Sarah becomes, Brie’s 
acting keeps the viewer invested. 
What at the beginning seemed 

quirky and awkward about Sarah 
becomes tragic and alarming, and 
one increasingly feels guilty for 
laughing.
By the end, viewers will likely 
have no idea what in “Horse Girl” 
was real and what was in Sarah’s 
incredibly fractured head. Yet the 
film’s chaos has an ever-present 
subtext of meaning, pointing 
towards how mentally-struggling 
people 
in 
modern 
America 
are isolated, joked about and 
misunderstood, left on their own 
to sort through the debilitating 
consequences of their conditions. 
“Horse Girl” is more than just 
another movie making fun of a 
current meme. It’s a hilarious, 
bizarre, 
heart-wrenching 
film 
that shows how everyday life 
can 
quickly 
fall 
apart 
and 
leave nothing but unanswered 
questions. 
The movie leaves so much 
up for interpretation that most 
people will probably find it a waste 
of time. Yet for those looking for 
something insanely innovative 
that also has something to say 
about America, there’s nothing 
better than “Horse Girl.”

‘Horse Girl’ gallops nimbly 
from hilarity to horror

Folk music is rooted in stories, 
a tradition that’s been passed 
down 
over 
many 
generations 
but constantly evolves as it takes 
the shape of modern society 
and culture. Folk artists pride 
themselves in maintaining this 
evolving folk tradition, writing 
music that tells the story of their 
lives and remains authentic to 
the narrative-centered roots of 
folk. The Lone Bellow follow this 
tradition in their new album Half 
Moon Light, dedicating the project 
to the small, often unnoticed 
details of the story of their lives, 
and extracting wisdom from these 
moments.
The 
fifteen-song 
album 
is 
cathartic in nature, a space for the 
trio to soothe their brokenness 
and the brokenness they see in the 
world. “Let it break you / Let it 
help you lay down what you held 
onto,” the group pleads in “Count 
on Me.” The somber undertones in 
many of the songs point to themes 
of death and loss. “I Can Still Feel 
You Dancing,” is a eulogy for lost 
relatives and the piano interludes 

throughout the album — “Intro,” 
“Interlude,” and “Outro” — are 
recordings from the funeral for lead 
singer Zach Williams’ grandfather.
Despite the album’s heaviness, 
the trio’s musical performance is 
life-giving. Anyone who’s listened 
to a Lone Bellow album or has seen 
them perform live knows that their 
harmonies are unmatched; The 
passion the trio possesses allows 

their stories to come alive. The 
band offers moments of life in songs 
like “Good Times,” urging their 
audience to embrace the lives they 
have while they’re still around. As 
they chant “Let no good time slip 
away,” the trio creates a sense of 
community that mimics a summer 
night, singing songs around a 
campfire with the people you love.

I got to witness the magic of 
The Lone Bellow at their recent 
performance at Ann Arbor Folk 
Festival when the group performed 
a short set comprised of their older 
songs as well some songs off the 
new album. After listening to the 
new project, I was surprised to 
find that the tracks on the album 
sounded nearly identical to their 
live performance. With its stripped 
back vocals and guitars, Half Moon 
Light allows the musical talents of 
the group to shine through in their 
simplicity.
Half Moon Light, in its soulful, 
folksy nature, is a celebration of 
life itself. Clearly The Lone Bellow 
have weathered highs and lows 
since their last album release, and 
the way they approached Half 
Moon Light as a space to let go 
of all the pain they’ve hung onto 
is a testament to the way music 
can heal. Like their prior albums, 
Half Moon Light preserves folk 
tradition through its story-telling 
and capacity to reach people at a 
personal level. The Lone Bellow 
embraced the opportunity to open 
up about their own lives, and now 
they’re taking us with them as they 
try to cope with and understand 
the moments in life we all struggle 
with.

Light’ threads life, death

Breaking news: school shooting. 
Too often, these words flash 
across the screens of homes 
all 
over 
America. 
Listening 
to the atrocities recounted on 
TV, it all seems too horrific to 
be true. Surreal clips of crying 
family members and mourning 
communities unveil before our 
eyes, and disbelief permeates 
every inch of our being. It’s hard 
to ignore the unwelcome feeling 
of morbid curiosity that our 
imagination sets into motion. 
What must it be like to attend a 
regular day at school, only to have 
it end in such tragedy and horror? 
What were the victims’ last 
thoughts? What was the shooter 
thinking?
Sahar Mustafah’s upcoming 
novel 
“The 
Beauty 
of 
Your 
Face” gives us a glimpse into the 
terrifying realities of a school 
shooting, and the circumstances 
that bring about this all-too-
common 
incident. 
The 
story 
follows a Palestinian-American 
woman, Afaf Rahman, as she 
navigates faith, family struggles 
and 
the 
unshakeable 
racial 
prejudices in American society 
leading up to and following 9/11. 
Afaf’s narrative is told through 
two alternating timelines. The 
bulk of the novel focuses on her 
life growing up in the suburbs 
of Chicago, while a present-day 
encounter with a school shooter 
frames the story. “The Beauty 
of Your Face” details Afaf’s 
journey from a scarring youth to 
a meaningful adulthood, in which 
she works as the principal of an 
all-girls Muslim school in Chicago: 
the Nurideen School for Girls. 
With profound insights and 
glittering 
words, 
Mustafah 
explores the realities of growing 
up in a community that rejected 
Afaf’s 
Palestinian 
immigrant 
family. Chicago in the 1970s and 
‘80s was a world where women 

were “kicked and shoved (...) at 
the supermarket” and called “rag-
head” at the gas station for wearing 
headscarves. As a young girl, Afaf 
is forced to be hyperaware of her 
Palestinian roots as she faces 
everything from microaggressions 
and ignorance to outright and 
intentional racism. She suffers 
heartbreak and hardship when 
her deeply unhappy sister, Nada, 
disappears without a trace and her 
parents succumb to the emotional 
burden of sadness that descends 
upon the family. Afaf’s difficult 
childhood makes her story all the 
more inspiring as she finds her 
way out of the spiral of misery 
that her parents surrendered to 

through perseverance and her 
discovery of Islam.
After 9/11, Afaf faces a new set 
of hardships as the underlying 
current of xenophobia in America 
crystallizes into a misguided fear 
of terrorists. This fear and hate 
is inevitably directed at Afaf and 
her family solely because they 
are Muslim. The headscarf Afaf 
donned with pride in her late 
teenage years becomes a symbol 
of terrorism in the eyes of ignorant 
American 
nationalists. 
In 
a 
heartbreaking exchange between 
Afaf and her daughter Azmia 
about recent terrorist attacks, 
Azmia asks her mother, “How 

can they do that? Aren’t they 
Muslim too?” to which Afaf has 
no good answer except “They’re 
not true muslimeen, habibti.” It 
is impossible not to share Afaf’s 
disbelief and frustration at the 
undeserved abuse she endures just 
because overseas terrorist groups 
use her cherished religion in the 
name of evil. 
The 
story 
is 
told 
mostly 
from 
Afaf’s 
perspective, 
but 
her 
narrative 
is 
periodically 
interrupted by chapters told from 
the point of view of the shooter. 
The shooter’s mind is a world of 
twisted fantasy, fueled by online 
chat rooms where anyone who 
isn’t white or born in America 
poses a threat to his existence. 
His perspective is both haunting 
and disturbing, as his initially 
cold and hateful voice gives way 
to a deep sense of loneliness. 
Though at times hard to read, 
this unconventional perspective 
highlights the depth of the divide 
between the xenophobic shooter 
and the students of Nurideen 
School for Girls. Mustafah seems 
to suggest that so much of the 
violence and hate in this country 
stems from this fundamental lack 
of understanding between people. 
“The Beauty of Your Face” 
is a complex generational novel 
that is all too relevant in today’s 
divided America. The underlying 
plea of the characters, “We are 
a religion of peace, not terror. 
We are Americans too,” echoes 
urgently through the pages of 
the novel. Afaf tries to bridge the 
gap between her and the shooter, 
urging him, “Tell me about your 
pain,” but it’s too late for him to 
see past their differences. Afaf and 
the shooter’s lives and experiences 
have led them to this point, and 
her small act of recognition can 
no longer put an end to the events 
that are unfolding. Nevertheless, 
the message rings loud and 
clear. Maybe violence could be 
avoided if people took the time to 
understand other people’s pain 
and find commonalities in their 
shared human experience.

‘The Beauty of Your Face’

Storako pitching as ace
T

op of the seventh, last 
chance for Georgia State. 
Sophomore right-hander 
Alex Storako 
trotted out 
and took 
her place 
inside the 
circle. With 
13 strikeouts 
under her 
belt, she was 
just two away 
from tying 
her single-
game record 
of 15 set last season against Michi-
gan State.
Skylar Mosel stepped up to 
the plate for Georgia State. Four 
pitches later, she was heading 
back to the bench after swinging 
for the third strike — 14 strike-
outs.
Sofia Tunon took her turn 
against Storako. And once again, 
Storako got another Panther to 
swing and miss for a third strike 
— 15.
Two outs. Gracie Kittrell was 
Georgia State’s last chance. Seven 
pitches in and Storako and Kittrell 
were locked in a full count. Stora-
ko sent the ball over the plate. Kit-
trell swung, but like those ahead 
of her, she found nothing but air 
— 16, a new career-best.
That was how Storako started 
her season. With emphasis. 
“I just had all my pitches,” 
Storako said.

She stamped Michigan soft-
ball’s season opener, a 6-1 win 
over Georgia State, with a per-
formance that made a statement 
about her year to come. She went 
on to contribute in three of the 
other four wins, helping the 
Wolverines improve to 5-0 on the 
season.
There was no debate over 
whether Storako was going to be 
a starter after coming off a suc-
cessful freshman campaign that 
ended in a 14-6 record and a 2.02 
ERA. She and junior left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien were locks in 
the pitching rotation entering the 
season.
But Storako’s performance in 
the Wolverines opening weekend 
at the USF-Rawlings Invitational 
warrants a new question: Does 
Michigan have a clear No. 1?
The short answer: no.
When asked, Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins praised both 
pitchers, not naming one ace, but 
rather treating the two as a pair.
Beaubien was the first pitcher 
in last year’s rotation. After all, 
Storako was only a freshman and 
Beaubien was coming off a cam-
paign that saw her win Big Ten 
Freshman and Pitcher of the Year.
And over the weekend’s games, 
Beaubien in no way played poorly. 
She finished with an ERA of 1.75 
and a 1.13 WHIP. 
But Storako excelled. This was 
her weekend, and Storako showed 
just how good she can be.

“Well, I thought our team had a 
great weekend and Alex certainly 
was a big part of that,” Hutchins 
said. “Last year, at this time, she 
couldn’t get through entire games, 
and now she’s doing a heavy load 
for us. I’m very pleased with that.”
Storako pitched in four of five 
games over the three-day slate, 
only sitting against South Florida. 
This included her record-setting 
start against Georgia State, a 
relief performance against Illi-
nois State, a zero earned-run 
outing against Fresno State and 
a complete game against the 
Wolverines’ best opponent of the 
weekend — No. 7 Florida — where 
she held the Gators to just two 
runs on six hits.
“I think it speaks for itself,” 
Hutchins said. “Now she’s carry-
ing the bulk of the load and she’s 
someone that we count on to be 
consistent and to be competitive.”
Storako came out of the week-
end boasting a 1.00 ERA and 
1.10 WHIP, while averaging 1.81 
strikeouts per inning and 12.67 
per game.
“I felt really good,” Storako 
said. “I was able to throw one 
pitch at a time.”
It’s a small sample size — just 
three starts and four games — but 
the numbers don’t tell a lie. Stora-
ko dominated.
Her pitching took over each 
game, paralyzing opposing 
offenses. Out of the 23 players she 
let on base over four games, 20 
were stranded.
Storako came out this weekend 
and pitched like an ace. Like a 
true number one Hutchins trust-
ed with the first game, last game 
and hardest game of the weekend. 
At the same invitational last 
season, Hutchins noted Storako 
surpassed then-sophomore Sarah 
Schaefer as the No. 2 pitcher in 
the rotation.
This year, Storako made her 
case again — this time for a share 
of No. 1.

Notebook: Faceoffs, line chemistry, 
penalties important for Wolverines

The past two weekends — more 
than any others — exemplified the 
importance of winning faceoffs 
for the Michigan hockey team. 
The Wolverines won a couple key 
faceoffs, at home against No. 13 
Ohio State and Wisconsin, that 
helped fuel wins.
In Friday’s game against the 
Buckeyes, a crucial faceoff victory 
came late in the second period. 
The score was tied at one a piece 
and sophomore forward Jimmy 
Lambert got ready to take a draw 
at the right circle of the offensive 
zone. 
Lambert won it and quickly 
sent it behind him to freshman 
defenseman 
Cam 
York. 
York 
hustled toward the left circle 
and found a window between 
defenders to rifle the puck into the 
net. That goal came at a turning 
point for the eventual 3-2 victory.
Then Saturday against the 
Badgers, senior forward Nick 
Pastujov won another important 
draw early in the first period of 
a then-scoreless game. Pastujov 
won the faceoff at the right 
circle of the defensive zone and 
soon connected with freshman 
forward Eric Ciccolini who sent it 
to freshman defenseman Keaton 
Pehrson near center ice. Pehrson 
did the rest, putting Michigan on 
the board in a 5-3 win that secured 
the weekend sweep.
These plays show just how 
much of an advantage winning a 
faceoff can be. It puts the opposing 
players on their feet, as they have 
to quickly get set in a defensive 
position and figure out what 
they’re going to do. A split second 
hesitation from the opposing 
defense in making that transition 
is all it takes to spur an offensive 
burst. And that was the case the 
past two weekends.
There’s plenty of room for the 
Wolverines to improve on faceoffs, 
as they’ve won 49.8 percent to 
date. That said, the results from 

the 
weekend 
could 
provide 
Michigan enough of an incentive 
to bear down on the draws.
When it comes to the drop of the 
puck, Pastujov is the Wolverines’ 
most talented player. He has taken 
close to 22-percent of his team’s 
faceoffs and is winning nearly 57 
percent of the time.
Slaker, Lambert, Granowicz 
line finding success
With 
freshman 
forward 
Johnny Beecher out during last 
Friday’s game due to a one-game 
suspension, the lines were changed 
up a bit. For the first time, the 
combination of senior forward 
Jake Slaker, freshman forward 
Nick Granowicz and Lambert 
found its way onto the ice.
“I thought that we were good 
on the forecheck,” Lambert said of 
the line. “We were just going to the 
net. A lot of the times, the goals are 
scored just within 10 feet of the net 
and that’s where we scored pretty 
much all of them, so we clicked 
well, but we were skating and we 
were moving it and communicating 
and that was big out there tonight. ”
And it worked for Michigan. 
The line helped churn three goals 
in the 8-4 win.
“I’ve been playing with Jimmy 
on and off for the last two years, so 
we have good chemistry,” Slaker 
said. “It was our first night with 
(Granowicz) and we had really 
good practices this week. We kind 
of went in with a game plan and it 
ended up working out.”

Despite Beecher’s return to the 
ice on Saturday, the Wolverines 
stuck to what worked — letting 
Slaker, Lambert and Granowicz 
continue to stick together. And once 
again, the results were positive. In 
the 5-3 victory, the line was on ice 
for two of Michigan’s goals.
Lambert left the game in the 
third period due to an undisclosed 
injury after sliding into the boards. 
If he can make a timely recovery, 
though, he and his new linemates 
could help the Wolverines continue 
their offensive strides that they’ve 
searched so long to find.
Penalties dwindling away
While 
hosting 
Wisconsin, 
Michigan 
significantly 
limited 
its penalties. Heading into the 
weekend, the Wolverines were 
averaging 8.96 penalty minutes 
a night. That figure wasn’t too 
much of an issue due to the group’s 
skillful penalty kill unit.
But in the two games against 
the Badgers combined, Michigan 
served just six total penalty 
minutes. 
“Honestly, I think it’s just the 
point in the season,” senior forward 
Jacob Hayhurst said of the drop. 
“It’s late. Everyone knows what the 
refs are gonna call and what they’re 
not gonna call. I think there’s 
gonna be a little more leeway each 
night, just because it’s getting that 
much closer to playoff hockey.”
However, if such improvement is 
here to stay, it could pay dividends 
down the road.

NATALIE STEPHENS/Daily
Senior forward Nick Pastujov won key faceoffs in Michigan’s weekend sweep.

Fresh faces

Five minutes into the first 
quarter, freshman midfielder Jake 
Bonomi glided across the left side 
of the field, tucking his crosse to 
his side as he face-dodged past a 
flurry of defenders. With his hands 
free, Bonomi then smoothly placed 
his shot right past the left shoulder 
of Cleveland State goalkeeper 
Gareth Haigh to net the Michigan 
men’s lacrosse team’s first goal of 
the 2020 season and his first goal 
as a Wolverine.
Alongside 
Bonomi, 
who 
recorded one other goal and 
one assist on Saturday, fellow 
freshmen attackman Josh Zawada 
and defenseman Dylan Gardner, 
who both found the back of the net 
twice, had impressive debuts as 
the Wolverines (1-0) defeated the 
Vikings (0-1), 16-9, in their season 
opener. 
With senior midfielder Avery 
Myers out due to injury, three 
freshmen found themselves in 
the Wolverines’ starting offensive 
rotation: Bonomi, Zawada and 
midfielder Jacob Jackson. 
And they all proved why they 
deserve to be starters, seamlessly 
integrating themselves into a 
fierce unit of goal-scorers that 
includes junior attackman Kevin 
Mack and sophomore attackman 
Bryce Clay.
“Playing alongside Kevin and 
Bryce, I have to work off them,” 
Zawada said. “Every time they 
dodge, I’m there. I gotta just 
know my place and what to do. 
Everything will fall into place 
after that.”
“We have some firepower with 
our offensive unit, but it’s more 
about leadership,” Michigan coach 
Kevin Conry said. “It’s just the 
quiet confidence in this group 
that they know that they have 
the ability to go on some of these 
runs.”
Bonomi 
and 
Zawada’s 
goals were paired with a set of 
opportunistic goals from junior 
midfielders Alex Buckanavage, 
after a man-up possession, and 
Steven Schnieder, following a 
lengthy ground ball scrum. By the 
end of the first quarter, Michigan 

extended its lead to 4-1.
“It 
was 
more 
about 
just 
understanding and knowing that 
they could do it,” Conry said. “It’s 
great to see them actually perform. 
They’ve had such good preseasons 
that we weren’t very surprised.”
Three minutes into the second 
quarter, 
Vikings’ 
attackman 
Tristan Hanna found teammate 
Ryan Haigh streaking through 
the Wolverines’ defensive unit. 
Haigh then fired a shot past senior 
goalkeeper Matt Trowbridge to 
cut Michigan’s lead to two goals.
But just two minutes later, Clay 
bulled his way through a Vikings’ 
defenseman and fired a shot past 
Haigh to re-extend Michigan’s 
lead to three.
The Wolverines didn’t look 
back from there. Highlighted by 
a ferocious time-and-room goal 
scored by fifth-year senior Rocco 
Sutherland and an open-net goal 
from near midfield by Gardner, 
Michigan piled on four more 
goals throughout the quarter. At 
halftime, the Wolverines stood tall 
with a commanding 9-3 lead.
In last season’s contest against 
Cleveland State, Michigan found 

itself in a similar situation, up 
7-0 halfway through the second 
quarter. The Wolverines let the 
Vikings back into the game and 
barely escaped with a victory, 10-8. 
This season, although Michigan 
was able to hold onto a healthy-
sized lead throughout the second 
half, Cleveland State never folded 
and scored twice as many goals in 
the second half as it did in the first. 
Led by Hanna, who scored two 
of his three goals in the second 
half, the Vikings capitalized on a 
young Wolverines’ defensive unit’s 
miscues on transition defense and 
positioning several times.
“You have to look and give 
Cleveland State a lot of credit,” 
Conry said. “Tristan Hanna is 
slippery. He’s got incredible hands 
and moves really well off the ball. 
A lot of it is the speed he was 
working at. … You look at those 
guys who are all freshmen getting 
back in the hole. A lot of times you 
get back in the hole, you rest. (And) 
you can’t rest. So that’s really the 
message that we have to continue 
to hammer into them.”
Despite 
occasional 
lapses, 
Michigan’s 
defense 
stood 
its 

ground for the most part and took 
advantage of numerous missed 
opportunities ceded by the Vikings. 
In addition to his two goals, 
Gardner scooped up seven ground 
balls and caused one turnover. 
Sophomore defensive midfielder 
Andrew Russell and sophomore 
defenseman Drake Schaffner each 
picked up three ground balls to 
award the Wolverines’ offense 
the possessions they needed to 
maintain their lead. 
In spite of Cleveland State’s 
offensive efforts, its defense was 
unable to contain Michigan’s 
offensive weapons throughout the 
second half.
Forty-five seconds into the third 
quarter, Jackson netted his first 
goal as a Wolverine. Following 
an 
unreleasable 
unnecessary 
roughness penalty by the Vikings, 
Buckanavage and Mack scored 
goals within a minute of one 
another to extend Michigan’s lead 
to eight, 12-4.
Whenever Cleveland State was 
able to score, the Wolverines had 
an answer.
And on Saturday, that was all 
they needed.

Freshmen lead Michigan past Cleveland State in dominating, 16-9, win

Saturday, the Michigan men’s 
lacrosse lineup was missing 
some familiar faces. Seniors 
Avery Myers — a starter in the 
midfield last season — and Finn 
Goonan were out with injuries. 
So, Michigan coach Kevin Conry 
turned to his youngest players.
They 
did 
more than heed 
his call. 
Freshman 
midfielder Jake 
Bonomi 
broke 
the seal for the 
Wolverines with 
his first career 
goal. 
Scoring 
within the first 
five minutes of 
play, Bonomi set 
the tone for the offensive core, 
and finished the game with two 
goals and one assist in a 16-9 win 
over Cleveland State. 
“He’s a missile,” Conry said. 
“He’s like the Energizer Bunny 
coming out of the box. We knew 
that we could surprise some 

people. The key with Jake is to 
continue to develop and keep 
playing as hard as he does.” 
Bonomi is not the only weapon 
in Michigan’s offensive unit. 
Sophomore 
attackman 
Bryce 
Clay led the team with three 
goals 
and 
junior 
attackman 
Kevin Mack put up two goals. 
With Myers — who was second 
in goals last year — set to return 
any week, the 
offensive 
unit 
will be a balance 
of upperclassmen 
who can lead the 
team and young 
players with a lot 
of potential. 
“We 
have 
some firepower 
with 
our 
offensive 
unit, 
but 
it’s 
more 
about the leadership,” Conry 
said. 
Freshman 
attackman 
Josh 
Zawada had an impressive start 
to his career as well, leading 
the team with three assists and 
putting up two goals, matching 
fellow 
freshman 
defensemen 
Dylan Gardner in scoring. 
“It felt awesome,” Zawada 
said. “It’s a dream come true 
wearing the Michigan uniform 
and wings on our helmets.”
“ … I get a lot of support from 
the upperclassmen. Every time I 
don’t know the plays and I don’t 
know where to go on the field 
they guide me through it and 
then the next rep I know what to 
do.”
The 
Wolverines 
hope 
leadership and team chemistry 
will lead them to a strong season. 
The team struggled last year to a 
4-9 record overall and went 1-4 in 
the Big Ten. 
And considering how injury-
prone the team was last season, 
being able to rely on younger 
players that have the ability 
to step up and perform will be 
important for Michigan. Veteran 
Wolverines have now seen they 
can trust the freshmen to hold 
their ground at a high level. 
“It’s huge,” Clay said. “We 
know they can play, and that’s 
why they’re on the field.”

‘M’ blows out Gophers on road, 77-52

Two weeks ago, against then-
No. 23 Northwestern, Michigan 
learned a hard lesson: In the Big 
Ten, if you don’t start well, you 
don’t win.
In their three games since 
then, 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
taken that lesson to the max — 
establishing dominant leads in 
the first quarter of every game. 
Monday’s matchup in Minnesota 
was no different as Michigan 
(16-7 overall, 7-5 Big Ten) leapt 
out to a nine point lead over the 
Golden Gophers (15-9, 5-8) and 
never 
looked 
back, 
winning 
77-52.
With freshman guard Maddie 
Nolan starting her second game 
in a row due to a hand injury to 
sophomore guard Danielle Rauch, 
Minnesota swiftly targeted her 
with its own freshman guard, 
Jasmine Powell. Making her fifth 
start of the season, Powell caught 
fire early, dicing up Nolan on the 
way to the rim.
Powell proved to be a daunting 
task for any defender, however, 
hitting a trio of first half 
3-pointers and slicing through 
traffic for quick layups. Her 17 
first-half points proved a thorn in 
Michigan’s side, teasing the idea 
of a comeback should it make a 
mistake.
The Gophers, though, couldn’t 

get anyone else going. Only two 
other 
players 
scored 
points, 
leaving them limping into the 
half deeply frustrated.
“(Powell) had a great first half 
and she had 17 points, and we 
were a little upset about that, 
but considering we held their 
team to 26, we were really happy 
about that,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “I thought 
our post did a tremendous job 
on their post play, just a great job 
defensively.”
The Wolverines’ four most 
experienced 
players 
quickly 
found themselves in foul trouble, 
all getting to three apiece midway 
through the third quarter. On 
a roster with just nine healthy 
players, foul trouble threatened 
to bring down the game plan like 
a house of cards.
Michigan’s 
house, 
though, 
stood strong no matter what 
the Gophers threw at it. Foul 
trouble aside, every single player 
that dressed put together a 
performance that left Minnesota 
in the dust.
Starting 
with 
assists, 
the 
Wolverines achieved a season-
high 25, with Dilk dishing out 
eight and sophomore forward 
Naz Hillmon and Nolan each 
contributing five. All that while 
tackling a focus area of cutting 
down on turnovers — having just 
seven.
“That’s 
outstanding, 
that’s 

obviously a season high for us 
for sure, and I thought we did a 
tremendous job of taking care 
of the ball,” Barnes Arico said. 
“That’s something we’ve been 
trying to get better at through the 
course of the year, and I thought 
it all started obviously with our 
point guard Dilk. She led the 
charge, she was tremendous 
tonight, she did a great job for us.”
Dilk and Hillmon, exhibiting 
their tag team at its most 
dangerous, 
also 
contributed 
22 and 21 points, respectively, 
despite being given discounted 
minutes in the blowout victory.
“When you have a teammate 
like Hillmon who draws so much 
attention to her, and she’s able 
to score out of that or pass out 
of that,” Dilk said. “I don’t know 
how many assists she had, but 
she’s been averaging a lot because 
she can pass. And we have guards 
like us that can cut off that, so 
that’s what we did tonight, and 
we found it to be very successful.”
A 
blowout 
that 
happened 
because 
Michigan 
was 
able 
to close the game out. Unlike 
the previous three games, the 
Wolverines wrapped an iron-
clad grip on the victory, shutting 
down any chance for Minnesota 
to find a way back in the game.
Michigan’s role players set 
the perfect harmony for its stars’ 
melody. It started well and it 
finished even better.

Brooks’s perimeter ‘D’ a highlight

A few weeks back, as Juwan 
Howard fielded questions from 
the media following a loss at 
Iowa, he wanted to make one 
thing clear — Eli Brooks was not 
in a slump.
“He’s been working extremely 
hard throughout the season,” 
Howard said. “At times, I know 
he’s been getting a lot of media 
attention and a lot of negative 
press. Unfortunately, at times 
some of it has been disrespectful 
I would say and it’s been unfair.”
The junior guard had been 
a consistent scorer for the 
Wolverines through the first 
two months of the season, but 
scored just 15 points on 7-of-23 
shooting over three games to 
begin January. 
But 
whatever 
plagued 
Brooks against Michigan State, 
Purdue and Minnesota from 
an offensive perspective was 
turned on its head against the 
Hawkeyes, as Brooks exploded 
for a career-high 25 points and 
shot 5-for-11 from deep.
But, as much as Howard 
commended 
Brooks 
for 
his 
offensive production that night, 
he made even more of a point of 
lauding Brooks’ defense.
“The beauty of it, which 
doesn’t show up on the box 
score, is Eli’s been one of our 
best defenders,” Howard said. 
“Usually if you have a guy who 
doesn’t make shots, they forget 
about playing defense on the 
other end because they get so 
frustrated because the shots not 
going in.
“Eli’s been the competitor 
that we’ve asked him to be. He’s 
shown he’s dependable. So, I’m 
very happy with Eli. He’s one of 
our leaders.”
Howard’s endorsement that 
night in Iowa City has rung 
true in the 22 days since, but 
was no more evident than when 
Michigan faced the Spartans on 
Saturday at Crisler Center.
In 
the 
teams’ 
previous 

meeting 
in 
early 
January, 
Michigan State’s All-American 
point guard Cassius Winston 
dominated the Wolverines with 
32 points and nine assists en 
route to an 18-point thrashing of 
Michigan. 
Saturday, 
though, 
things 
were different for both Winston 
and the Spartans. Brooks was 
a major reason why. Michigan 
coach Juwan Howard switched 
the 
defensive 
assignments 
ahead of Saturday’s rematch, 
handing the task of guarding 
Winston to Brooks — arguably 
the Wolverines’ best perimeter 
defender — instead of senior 
guard Zavier Simpson.
“Honestly, I think (Zavier) 
did a great job of handling it 
because that’s the little matchup 
battle,” Livers said. “But Cassius 
guards Eli, so it was like, ‘Eli, 
why don’t you turn around and 
guard Cassius?’ Make it simple. 
And Eli, man, he’s a pest. He’s a 
really good defender.”
In addition to 11 points and 
nine boards of his own, Brooks 
held Winston to just 20 points on 
18 shots. In stymying Michigan 
State’s maestro, the Wolverines 
disrupted the Spartans’ offense 
as a whole — holding them to an 
offensive rating of 94.4, down 
from 114.5 in their previous 
matchup, per KenPom. 
“I know in the last game 
Cassius was very comfortable,” 
Howard said. “I went back 
and watched film of our last 

game. I just wanted to give 
him a different look. I knew 
Eli 
— 
defensively, 
he’s 
a 
very disciplined player, very 
technical. He’s not gonna make 
many mistakes.
“I thought he did a really good 
job staying front of Cassius, 
making every catch tough for 
him, as well as challenging 
every shot without fouling.”
Like 
Howard, 
Brooks’ 
teammates weren’t surprised by 
his play against Winston, noting 
how he prides himself on the 
little things defensively.
“A lot of people overlook Eli,” 
Livers said. “I honestly hate 
when he guards me in practice. 
You can’t come off any ball 
screens, you can’t drive. He 
doesn’t give up any angles. He 
told me his dad taught him that 
at a young age, so that’s why he’s 
so excellent at it now.”
While Brooks is undoubtedly 
a capable scorer, his offensive 
numbers have ebbed and flowed 
at times this season. What 
hasn’t fluctuated is his effort 
defensively. 
With 
Livers, 
Michigan’s 
leading 
scorer, 
back 
from 
injury, Simpson scoring double-
digits in seven of his last nine 
games and the emergence of 
sophomore forward Brandon 
Johns Jr., Brooks doesn’t need 
to be a go-to guy offensively. 
But on defense, performances 
like 
Saturday’s 
are 
always 
welcomed.

Omaha stakes

 It was closer to a live 
batting practice session than a 
scrimmage, let alone a playoff 
game. 
Omaha, 
Neb. 
was 
hundreds of miles and many 
months in the rearview mirror. 
But watching junior right-
hander Blake Beers and the large 
portion of the No. 8 Michigan 
baseball team that participated, 
it was easy to wonder whether 
this event had more importance 
than what met the eye.
Perhaps 
it 
did. 
Former 
starters Tommy Henry and Karl 
Kauffman teamed up for 254.2 
innings last year. Gone too are 
heart-of-the-order 
mainstays 
Jordan 
Brewer 
and 
Jimmy 
Kerr and their combined 123 
RBI. Junior center fielder Jesse 
Franklin and his 51 walks will 
not be available for at least two 
weeks as he continues recovering 
from a skiing-related injury. 
Short-term or long-term, these 
are roles that need filling, and 
Sunday’s intrasquad scrimmage 
gave many Wolverines a chance 
to make a case for themselves. 
A few took notable advantage of 
the opportunity.
Beers, the first pitcher of 
the afternoon, stared in at each 
hitter 
with 
indiscriminate 
intensity. He often brushed 
the rubber off with his foot, 
although there was no dirt to 
get rid of on synthetic ramp that 
served as a mound. The gesture 
drove home just how seriously 
he took the experience.
“There’s plenty of stuff there,” 
Michigan coach Eric Bakich 
said. “For him, it’s just doing 
it against another jersey, and 
he certainly has the look of a 
much more confident kid and the 
ability to do that this year.”
On Sunday, Beers did it 
against batters wearing his own 
jersey. He occasionally struggled 
with control — issuing back-to-
back walks at one point — but 
allowed few hard-hit balls over 
several innings of work. 
“He’s certainly a guy we could 

look at as a potential starter, 
a potential long reliever, a 
potential high-leverage reliever, 
a potential closer,” Bakich said. 
Beers’ long, downhill stride 
and traditional arm slot — 
along with a relative lack of 
pinpoint accuracy — do not 
make him a likely candidate to 
be a situational, one-out reliever. 
Without a niche role, Beers 
will be one of a dozen pitchers 
looking for innings in Michigan’s 
deep bullpen. His focus and 
drive, then, should hardly come 
as a surprise. 
Next up was sophomore left-
hander Jack White. His fastballs 
exploded in the catcher’s mitt, 
speeding up bats against his 

secondary pitches. 
“(Pitching 
coach 
Chris) 
Fetter’s been working with me a 
lot on my curveball,” White said. 
“Just being able to throw that for 
strikes. He’s been a huge help 
developing that pitch.”
White also found swing-and-
miss success with his offspeed 
pitches. When junior outfielder 
Jordan Nwogu drew a walk — 
one of the few to reach base 
against White — he promptly 
stole second and third base. 
Working out of the stretch, 
White ended the inning by 
making senior Dominic Clementi 
flail at a breaking ball in the dirt. 
The tennis-match quiet was 
interrupted; 
the 
Wolverines 
behind 
the 
backstop 
were 
momentarily beside themselves 
in disbelief of the filthiness 
they’d just witnessed. 
“What he did today — he’s got 
a good fastball, we’ve even seen 
it in the low 90s, with a good 
breaking ball,” Bakich said. “All 

the makings are there of a guy 
that has a chance to get some 
outs for us in relief.” 
At and behind the plate, 
freshman 
Jimmy 
Obertop 
exhibited a variety of skills 
with the game-mode deadpan 
of Beers. His swing keeps the 
barrel in the strike zone for a 
long time, in part due to quick 
hands getting the handle out in 
front. Offensively, he provides 
a viable alternative to junior 
catcher Joe Donovan.
“Jimmy can hit,” Bakich said. 
“He hits the ball as hard as 
Nwogu and Franklin. His exit 
velos and what he’s capable of — 
he’s a serious power threat.”
In 
two 
at-bats, 
Obertop 
demonstrated his potential to 
become a three true outcomes 
hitter — a batter who ends a 
significant portion of his plate 
appearances with either a walk, 
a strikeout or a homer; the kind 
of offensive threat that analytics 
has proven to be very productive. 
While he went down on strikes 
against White, his second trip to 
the plate saw him line a pitch 
up the middle, a no-doubt extra 
base hit if not for the cramped 
dimensions of the field house. He 
demonstrated savviness, if not 
speed, on the basepaths: After 
staying put during two straight 
balls in the dirt, he successfully 
stole a base by running on 
delivery. By luring the defense 
into complacency after resisting 
the temptation of taking a chance 
on one of two potential passed 
balls, Obertop maximized his 
chance of success. 
His bat will force him into 
lineups, 
but 
his 
defensive 
versatility makes the decision to 
start him easier.
“Good catcher, can play first 
base, could play the outfield if we 
needed him to, or DH,” Bakich 
said. “I expect he’ll be in there, 
somewhere.”
That last line is one that 
Beers, 
White 
and 
Obertop 
would all like to have applied 
to their names. Thanks to their 
scrimmage performances, that 
dream may have inched a little 
closer to reality.

In intrasquad scrimmage, Michigan shows talent to fill holes created by draft departures from last year’s CWS roster

JACK WHITTEN
Daily Sports Writer

Beach balls.
That’s how former Michigan 
outfielder 
Jordan 
Brewer 
excitedly described the pitches 
coming toward him when he 
launched a grand slam over the 
left field wall as the Wolverines 
trounced 
Manhattan College, 
23-2, last March. His description 
speaks to a mentality that drove 
Brewer 
toward 
consistent 
dominance at the plate last 
season as Michigan utilized its 
offensive power to make a World 
Series run.
But Brewer won’t be back in 
Ann Arbor this year.
As the 2020 season begins 
with higher expectations than 
ever before, the team has lost 
many key hitters, particularly on 
the front end of last year’s lineup. 
Brewer, in the three-hole last 
year, went on to be drafted by the 
Houston Astros in the third round 
of last June’s MLB draft. Jimmy 
Kerr, whose eight postseason 
home runs were crucial in the 
Wolverines’ run to Omaha, was 
selected by the Detroit Tigers 
in the 33rd round. And junior 
outfielder Jesse Franklin, who 
batted second and posted a .477 
slugging percentage with 13 
home runs and 55 RBI, will miss 
at least the first two weeks of the 
season due to a collarbone injury 
sustained while skiing. 

But Michigan’s lineup isn’t 
without options. Their leadoff 
hitter, junior outfielder Jordan 
Nwogu, appears prepared to stay 
in that position in the lineup. 
“I like the tone it sets, having 
that strapping dude walking 
up to the plate to lead off the 
game with a double or a homer,” 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich said. 
“He’s done well in that role and 
he poses a totally dynamic speed-
power threat, so I like him up 
there in the top of the order.”
Nwogu, who was named to 
the Preseason All-America first 
team by the National Collegiate 
Baseball 
Writers 
Association, 
doesn’t seem too worried about 
the team’s ability to adapt.
“I don’t see my role changing 
this year,” Nwogu said. “We have 
a lot of great guys that came in, 
as well as guys who have been 
here and stepped up — like 
Danny Zimmermann and Jimmy 
Obertop — who are power guys, 
so I don’t think we’re really going 
to feel too much of a loss from last 
year.”
Nwogu’s mention of Obertop, 
a freshman catcher expected 
to start at designated hitter in 
Michigan’s College World Series 
rematch against Vanderbilt on 
Friday, underscores how much 
attention he has drawn during 
the preseason for his hitting 
ability. 
“Jimmy can hit, and he hits the 
ball just as hard as Nwogu and 

Franklin,” Bakich said “He’s got 
big juice in his bat and can put in 
a double or extra base hit at any 
time, so he really put the charge 
into the ball which is really 
impressive for a young kid.”
Bakich seemed confident in 
the team’s offensive dynamism, 
but noted how hard it is to predict 
how the offense will settle.
“We had so many different 
guys perform so well at various 
times throughout the year, but 
remember offense is (different) 
than pitching,” Bakich said. 
Hitting indeed requires a 
different approach than pitching. 
A team can do a lot right at the 
plate and still not have much to 
show for it.
Michigan has long crafted its 
at-bats to allow scoring quickly, 
early and often, as well as crafting 
a versatile lineup that can sustain 
a range of pitchers. This strategy 
doesn’t seem destined to change 
in spite of its personnel losses. 
In 
yesterday’s 
intrasquad 
scrimmage, the coaching staff’s 
emphasis on inflicting quick 
damage was clear. 
Despite the losses, Bakich 
isn’t worried about how his team 
will craft its offensive identity. 
Last year, there were plenty of 
questions coming in, too, and he 
saw how that ended up.
“There were a lot of lumps that 
we took,” Bakich said. “But in 
doing so, we got better because of 
it and we got back up every time.”
