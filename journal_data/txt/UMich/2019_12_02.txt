ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Ohio State crushes Michigan, 
56-27, handing Jim Harbaugh 
his fifth-straight loss in the 
rivalry.

 » Page 1B

Hundreds of people lined the 
blocks outside local marijuana 
dispensaries early Sunday morning 
as Ann Arbor businesses Exclusive 
Brands, 
Arbors 
Wellness 
and 
Greenstone 
Provisions 
opened 
sales of marijuana to recreational 
users for the first time. The stores 
are three of six retail shops in the 
state of Michigan licensed to sell 
recreational marijuana.
Michigan passed Proposal 18-1 
last November, allowing adults 
over the age of 21 to possess up 
to 2.5 ounces of marijuana. The 
proposition also stipulated that 
recreational sales of marijuana 
be subject to a 10-percent excise 
tax in addition to Michigan’s six-
percent sales tax. Applications to 
sell recreational marijuana opened 
Nov. 1.
The 
Michigan 
Marijuana 
Regulatory 
Agency 
announced 
Wednesday that licensed retailers 
may transfer up to 50 percent of 

their medical inventory from the 
past month to their recreational 
inventory. Currently, six stores have 
received recreational licenses, four 
of which are located in Ann Arbor, 
one in Evart, and one in Morenci, 
though not all of them have opened 
sale to recreational users yet.
Al Moroz, manager of Arbors 
Wellness, said he wasn’t surprised 
by the number of people waiting 
to make recreational purchases, as 
consumers have been making their 
demand known. 
“We’ve had phones literally 
calling about recreational sales of 
marijuana since the first of the year 
— ever since basically Michigan 
voted 
to 
allow 
recreational 
possession of cannabis, people 
have been expecting us to sell it,” 
Moroz said. “We’re very happy that 
we’re able to sell it today. We’ve 
been seeing a lot of interest all 
week, basically since they made the 
announcement about transferring 
inventory, so we’re not really 
surprised by the crowds, but it’s still 
a great thing to see.”

On Jim Harbaugh’s fifth try, 
on Michigan’s eighth since it last 
won this matchup and on a day 
that, for a moment, seemed to 
have all the ingredients, it wasn’t 
enough. Not nearly enough. And 
after another year of coming up 
short against Ohio State, it seems 
like it might never be.
When Austin Mack delivered 
the last dagger to Michigan’s 

hopes, running to the corner 
of the end zone after a 16-yard 
touchdown and celebrating with 
his teammates as the Buckeyes’ 
lead grew to 22 late in the fourth 
quarter, Harbaugh looked on 
with one hand on his hip. He 
slumped his shoulders, then 
started to walk up the sideline. 
After the ensuing kickoff, 
Patterson had nothing left to 
do but trot back out onto the 
field. He took a first-down sack 
and was still on the ground as 

four Buckeye defensive linemen 
celebrated behind him. What 
remained of the maize portion 
of a crowd of 112,071 headed 
towards the exits. Those in 
scarlet congregated in the lower 
level, knowing their school’s 
grip on the conscience of the 
Michigan 
football 
program 
would last another year.
No. 1 Ohio State beat No. 13 
Michigan, 56-27, on Saturday in 
a game that felt inevitable even 
after the Wolverines injected 

belief into it. The Buckeyes 
went for 577 total yards and 264 
on the ground as, a year after 
giving up 62 points in Columbus, 
Michigan’s defense had just as 
many answers as it did in 2018.
“We gotta be so much better,” 
said sophomore defensive end 
Aidan 
Hutchinson. 
“There’s 
nothing we haven’t seen before, it 
was all as expected. We just gotta 
execute better and just all do our 
jobs. And we didn’t.”

Washtenaw County approves $100k 
in funding for Title X services

Board of Commissioners authorize funds given to Planned Parenthood 

DESIGN BY LIZZY RUEPPEL

The Washtenaw County Board 
of Commissioners unanimously 
approved $100,000 in funding for 
Planned Parenthood of Michigan 
Title X Services to the community 
on 
Nov. 
20. 
These 
services 
include breast cancer screenings, 
contraception education, sexually 
transmitted infection and HIV 
testing and other wellness exams. 
Title X funds do not pay for 
abortion services. 
According to the press release, 
Planned Parenthood of Michigan 
serves roughly 10,000 patients in 
Washtenaw County alone, and was 
recently stripped of its funding 
when the Trump administration 

updated Title X regulations in 
March. Title X intends to provide 
health care services to low-
income and uninsured individuals 
at little to no costs.
District 
8 
Commissioner 
Jason Morgan said he strongly 
supported allocating the money to 
Planned Parenthood.
“We thought it was extremely 
important to ensure that these 
other services continue to be 
provided,” Morgan said. “I think 
everybody understood the topic 
that we were looking at. I had a 
conversation with some folks at 
Planned Parenthood who outlined 
the challenges for me.”
After that conversation with 
Planned 
Parenthood, 
Morgan 
brought in Lori Carpentier, the 
president of Planned Parenthood 

Michigan, to talk about funding 
with the Board of Commissioners 
at a meeting. The board realized 
that it needed to start providing 
these services to the county 
through the Washtenaw County 
Health Department, but it would 
take six months for the county to 
be ready to provide them.
“We decided we needed to 
help Planned Parenthood to help 
bridge that gap so we didn’t have 
any of these services cut off in the 
meantime,” Morgan said.
District 9 Commissioner Katie 
Scott said she was proud that 
these funds would continue giving 
women access to Title X services 
during this transition period to 
the Health Department.
“No women, regardless of 
economic conditions, should be 

denied services like STD testing 
and cancer screenings,” Scott 
said.
Without these funds, Morgan 
said he feared the negative impact 
in the community would be 
widespread.
“There are 10,000 (people) 
who would either not have 
access to these services or not 
be able to afford them, and we 
would have an increase in STD 
rates, and a potential increase 
in 
unplanned 
pregnancy,” 
Morgan said.
Scott noted there have been 
some concerns in the community 
about the funds being used to 
support abortion services.

Daily Staff Reporter 

State 
Reps. 
Yousef 
Rabhi, 
D-Ann 
Arbor, 
and 
Robert 
Wittenberg, 
D-Huntington 
Woods, introduced legislation to 
prevent landlords in Michigan 
from denying tenants housing 
based on their source of income 
last month.
The Housing Choice Voucher 
Program is a federal program that 
supplements housing costs for 
low-income families, the elderly 
and people with disabilities. In 
the state of Michigan, landlords 
are able to deny tenants housing 
based on their source of income, 
including 
housing 
choice 
vouchers and veterans’ benefits. 
Rabhi said the source of rental 
payments should not matter if 
payments are able to be made. 
“If you are able to pay for the 
rent, who cares where the money 
comes from?” Rabhi said. 
By 
adding 
housing 
discrimination to the list of 
what the Michigan Civil Rights 
Commission 
can 
investigate, 
Rabhi hopes the bills will address 
the 
economic 
discrimination 
housing choice voucher users 
face.

“The landlords want to be 
able to push people out because 
there’s a certain stigma that 
comes with Section 8, there’s a 
certain stigma when it comes 
with being low-income,” Rabhi 
said. “And that’s the stigma 
that is as much created by the 
landlord, as it is a social stigma 
that exists out there that we need 
to break down.”
The 
city 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 
already has protections against 
economic 
discrimination 
in 
place, as illustrated in the 
Rights and Duties of Tenants 
pamphlet landlords are required 
to provide. The portion written 
by the city specifies “No lessor 
may refuse to rent to you or 
to discriminate in your rental 
agreement or privileges because” 
... “(7) You get your income from 
welfare payments or any other 
legal source.” 
Laura 
Rall, 
Social 
Work 
student 
and 
president 
of 
Affordable Michigan, said though 
Ann Arbor already has these 
protections, Rabhi’s bill will 
benefit low-income and veteran 
U-M students and staff on the 
Flint and Dearborn campuses.

Against an Ohio State team that 
left Ann Arbor 12-0, the College 
Football Playoff likely in front of it, the 
Wolverines (9-3 overall, 6-2 Big Ten) 
had to play a near-perfect game to keep 
up. All it took to put the game out of 
reach was a few mistakes.
Senior safety Josh Metellus let 
Buckeye receiver Chris Olave get a step 
on him late in the first quarter. Seconds 
later, Olave was streaking down the 
right sideline for a 57-yard touchdown, 
turning a 7-6 game into a 14-6 game. 
A few drives later, with Michigan 
trying to cut into an eight-point deficit, 
Patterson dropped a snap in the red 
zone. It was the second of three first-
half drives that got to the red zone. 
Michigan got a combined nine points 
from them. 
“We knew we were gonna have to 
put up points and we needed to score 
a couple touchdowns in the red area,” 
Patterson said. “... You can’t fumble the 
ball down there.”
Following 
the 
fumble, 
the 
Wolverines’ defense seemed to have 
secured a monumental stop, but senior 
VIPER Khaleke Hudson jumped 
offsides on a punt. On the very next 
play, Ohio State quarterback Justin 

Fields sailed a 47-yard post route 
to Garrett Wilson, and on the play 
after that, running back J.K. Dobbins 
walked into the end zone for his third 
of four touchdowns on the day. At that 
point, with just over three minutes 
left in the first half, the Buckeyes led, 
28-13. Michigan wouldn’t get within 
one score again.
Despite Patterson’s 300 yards on the 
day, and despite an offense that kept 
pace for as long as it could, that was all 
it took for the floodgates to open. 
Dobbins 
opened 
the 
second 
half with a 41-yard run, then got 21 
more when the Wolverines left him 
uncovered in the flat. On the sideline, 
Don Brown screamed and clapped his 
hands. It all built to a six-yard K.J. Hill 
touchdown to extend the Buckeyes’ 
lead to 35-16, and all but ending the 
competitive portion of the afternoon.
As much as winning this game 
was an expectation few thought the 
Wolverines could meet, the sting will 
linger, just as it always does. Harbaugh 
is now 0-5 against the Buckeyes. Don 
Brown’s defense has given up 1,144 
yards against them in the last two years. 
Fields said afterwards that Ohio State 
takes this game more seriously, and 
true or not, Michigan can’t look to 
any on-field result to refute him.

Students from conservation biology visit the Detroit Zoo as part of a class field trip to learn about conservation practices Saturday morning. 

Arbors Wellness opened its 
doors at 9 a.m. but prioritized 
medical patients before making 
its first recreational sales. The 
first sales were made to Lansing 
resident Ryan Basore and Flint 
native John Sinclair, longtime 
marijuana activists who have 
both faced arrests for marijuana 
related charges. Sinclair’s 1969 
arrest for marijuana possession 
and subsequent 10 year sentence 
spurred protests, including a 1971 
concert held at the University of 
Michigan at which John Lennon 
and Yoko Ono performed, entitled 
the John Sinclair Freedom Rally.
“The first few sales were to 
very historic people that have 
been fighting prohibition for 
quite some time,” Moroz said. 
“I was really happy to be able 
to provide them legal sales of 
cannabis for something they had 
been working towards for years 
at this point.”
Jacque Kyllonen, a Washtenaw 
County resident who arrived 
at 9 a.m. and had been waiting 
for two hours outside Arbors 
Wellness, said she felt the first 
day of legal recreational sales was 
an important historical moment. 
“I’m here joining a part of 
history,” Kyllonen said. “I don’t 
have a medical card, and I use 
this as medicine, so it’s kind of 
cool. I have fibromyalgia, and 
I have chronic migraines, so it 
definitely helps.”
Those who braved the cold 
were welcomed with free coffee 
and 
donuts 
outside 
Arbors 
Wellness. Melissa Mueller, a sales 
manager for the cannabis brand 
Mary’s Medicinals, which is 
sold at Arbors Wellness, walked 
down the line passing out donuts 
to show the brand’s support for 
Arbors Wellness. 
“Arbors 
Wellness 
has 
supported us for a long time, so 
we’re just here passing out donuts 
for the people who are waiting in 
line this morning,” Mueller said. 
Outside 
Greenstone 
Provisions, spirits were similarly 
high. Sean Ryan, a senior at 
Eastern Michigan University, had 
been in line for about 90 minutes 
and said he was excited to be 

able to easily buy recreational 
products he enjoys.
“We love easy access to 
edibles, it’s fantastic,” Ryan said. 
“It’s dope.”
Moroz sees both safety and 
economic benefits to legalizing 
recreational usage. 
“To be able to have an avenue 
that is both regulated and safe 
and controlled and provides 
revenue to the state is really 
a great place to have as far as 
cannabis,” Moroz said. “It should 
be a great thing moving forward 
for our company as well as the 
whole state of Michigan.”
LSA senior Eric TerBush 
was a part of Green Wolverine, 
a cannabis business student 
organization, when the group 
worked with Matthew Abel, one 
of the authors of Proposal 1, while 
the proposal was being drafted. 
TerBush also currently works 
at Benzinga, a financial news 
company in Detroit, where he 
manages their cannabis media. 
TerBush thinks the market for 
marijuana will not see many 
immediate changes.
“I think the most prominent 
changes we’re going to see are 
exacerbated supply shortages. 
Generally there’s been a lot of 
issues with supply shortages 
in the past year,” TerBush 
said. “LARA (Licensing and 
Regulatory Affair) has really 
dragged their toes as they slowly 
grant licenses and slowly grant 
renewal paperwork to people 
… and (the limited number of 
suppliers) has really not met up 
with demand.”
TerBush said he imagines most 
students who are buying from 
the black market will continue 
to do so out of convenience until 
cannabis 
companies 
invest 
more in cannabis production as 
they see increased profits. He 
imagines a future decrease in 
prices and increase in supply has 
the potential to decrease black 
market incentives.
“I think it sets up the initial 
stage for a black market to 
decrease in size,” TerBush said. 
“The prices are going to suck for 
a while, store openings are going 
to suck for a while, shortages are 
probably going to happen for a 
while. It’s a slow, gradual process 
that we’re working towards, but 
in the moment it’s a bit rocky.”

Behind the leaderless revolution

Dear Hasan,

Arabic food... but make it vegan

White-washed

ELIZABETH HO
MiC Columnist

I don’t like the term “white-
washed” as it is applied to people 
of color. Sure, we can say that 
Hollywood 
is 
white-washed 
— PoC stories and characters 
are frequently replaced with 
white ones — but to say that PoC 
themselves are white-washed is 
degrading.
Many times I’ve heard remarks 
such as, “She’s in a sorority, so 
she’s basically white” and “He’s 
not one of us because he grew up 
in an all-white neighborhood.”
Once, I was called white-
washed by a classmate after 
she found out that I listened to 
punk rock (AKA “angry white 
boy music”). She was suggesting 
that only white people could 
enjoy that kind of music, which 
is a backward way of thinking. 
Another time, I was called a 
“banana”— yellow on the outside, 
white on the inside — for liking 
Starbucks. 
Although I was eventually 
able to make light of these 
experiences, I’m aware that 
others may take great offense 
to being called white-washed. 
And on a more serious note, 
we shouldn’t think of people as 
having less of a claim to a certain 
identity just because they don’t 
conform to our stereotypes. 
A problem that is particularly 
relevant to the Asian-American 
community is thinking that 

someone isn’t “Asian enough,” 
or, in extreme cases, a culture 
traitor, if they don’t speak their 
immigrant 
parents’ 
native 
language. I worry that we are 
pressuring 
people 
to 
other 
themselves rather than establish 
a genuine connection to their 
heritage for the sake of being 
accepted by their fellow PoC.
This business of calling people 
white-washed seems to stem at 
least in part from resentment. 
I recognize that some PoC are 
more easily accepted by white 
America than others. Further, I 
admit that I would be frustrated 
if another Asian-American was 
treated better than I was because 
she appeared more aligned with 
white ideals. The situation would 
be unfair, but I would be wrong 
for being frustrated with her as 
an individual, especially if I didn’t 
know much else about her. I 
would be wrong to invalidate her 
experience. How she acts could 
be a result of her upbringing, 
over which she had little control 
(as little control as I did over my 
own upbringing), and I’m not 
even considering the possibility 
of cross-cultural adoption. 
Instead of judging people 
for who we think they are, 
maybe we need to address the 
structures and practices that 
favor white normativity in the 
first place. Maybe we also need to 
address our internalized racism, 
including our biases about what 
belongs to whom. 

In 2014, the streets of Hong 
Kong erupted with the nascent 
Umbrella Revolution. Led by 
activist Joshua Wong and his 
student organization Scholarism, 
the protests consisted of the 
79-day peaceful occupation of 
Central, an important financial 
and tourist district. The name of 
the movement is derived from the 
use of umbrellas as an adaptive 
measure for protestors to protect 
themselves from tear gas deployed 
by the police. The Umbrella 
Revolution 
demonstrated 
the 
lengths 
that 
the 
government 
would go to in order to suppress its 
people. The Umbrella Revolution 
protested Hong Kong’s lack of 
true universal suffrage: a new bill 
stated that the chief executive was 
to be elected from a collection 
of candidates approved by the 
Chinese Communist Party.
In June 2015, the electoral 
reform bill was rejected by the 
legislative council.
Four years later, the Hong Kong 
government presented another 
controversial bill: a new law that 
would allow Hong Kongers to be 
extradited to mainland China. The 
frightening implications that the 
extradition bill could quash future 
pro-democracy movements were 
all too real with the arrest of key 
pro-democracy activists earlier 
in the year. The people of Hong 
Kong joined together in protest, 

including 
a 
record-breaking 
turnout of 2 million protestors 
(the region’s total population is 7 
million).

 

There is a key difference 
from the 2014 protests: these 
new protests are leaderless and, 
rather than a united movement, 
seem to be the result of several 
movements linked together by 
the same ideology. The protests 
vary in nature from peaceful and 

authorized to civil disobedience 
to vandalism and violence against 
the police.
In 
a 
piece 
for 
Quartz, 
Wong writes, “Instead of rallying 
behind one leader or leading 
body, Hong Kong citizens are 
all working together. In real 
time, we’re coordinating using 
online forums, word of mouth 
and organic, collective action, 
without the impetus of traditional 
movement leaders.”
Much 
of 
the 
collaboration 
is 
through 
Chinese-language 
websites, 
but 
non-Chinese 
speakers can still view and 
participate 
in 
the 
movement 
through bilingual websites like 
the subreddit r/HongKong on the 
American social network Reddit. 
Boasting a membership of over 
230,000 users, the subreddit is 
frequently updated with photo 
and video evidence of incidents 
of police brutality. As in the 
2014 Umbrella Revolution, this 
year’s protests have been marked 
with numerous cases of police 
reacting with increasing force. As 
a criticism of the police’s response 
to the protests, numerous groups 
have called for a “sixth demand”: 
the disbandment of Hong Kong’s 
police force. However, there are 
concerns 
that 
the 
protestors 
may have more to fear from the 
mainland government.
Carol Anne Goodwin Jones of 
the Hong Kong Free Press reports, 
“The violence in Hong Kong in 
recent weeks has led to fears 
that Beijing is gearing up for a 

crackdown against the protesters. 
Direct intervention by Chinese 
forces is permitted under the 
Basic Law, Hong Kong’s ‘mini-
constitution’, 
if 
Hong 
Kong 
declares a state of emergency 
– which it hasn’t yet done. The 
garrison 
of 
China’s 
People’s 
Liberation Army stationed in 
central Hong Kong was recently 
reinforced and the People’s Armed 
Police has been seen massing and 
drilling just over the border in 
Shenzhen. This lends credence to 
what the protestors see as a ‘last 
stand’ to save the city they call 
home.” 
Already 
in 
their 
18th 
consecutive 
week, 
the 
2019 
protests show no sign of stopping. 
On Oct. 6, 2019, Chief Executive 
Carrie Lam employed emergency 
legislation to enact a ban on face 
masks. The masks have thus 
far allowed many protestors to 
remain 
anonymous. 
Opposing 
this law as one that may cause 
the police to also target the ill and 
those with respiratory problems, 
the protestors continue to wear 
masks to their march. Many now 
sport signs or alternatives to the 
usual face mask that reference the 
ban. 
The future of the protests 
remains uncertain, but Wong 
believes 
that 
no 
matter 
the 
circumstances, 
the 
protestors 
won’t stand down until their 
demands are met. Wong states, 
“Hong 
Kongers 
will 
never 
surrender, 
because 
we 
have 
nowhere else to turn.”

I’ve been meaning to reach out to you for a 
while now. I even contemplated writing you a very 
thoughtful instagram DM about how much I enjoy 
and appreciate your work and everything that you do 
to represent the Indian-American community. But 
the thought of sliding into your DM’s weirded me out 
a little. So instead, I’m going to let you know in the 
most normal and least awkward way possible: a very 
public Michigan Daily article. Plus I’ve missed a few 
meetings and haven’t written in a while, so this works 
on multiple fronts.
Funny enough, I was introduced to you by my Dad. 
For context, my Dad is a lot like Najme, in the sense 
that he’s a Dad, he’s Indian and still works with the 
intensity and passion that he had when he immigrated 
to America. He might be one of the hardest working 
people I know. Actually, on second thought, that 
might be my mom, considering that she had to raise 
me. But we digress. My Dad usually comes home from 
work and enters our house on what seems to be a 
very serious conference call, or he is just upset about 
something. Therefore, I was quite surprised and a little 
concerned when my Dad came home laughing on a fall 
day during my junior year of high school. He then told 
me to stop working on my math homework because 
he heard a really funny story on the Moth radio hour 
where the comedian was speaking Hindi and that I 
had to hear it. Now, for anyone who has parents who 
are engineers or maybe just Asian can appreciate the 
rarity of this moment. On most days, the opposite 
would happen and my dad would start teaching me 
how to do my math homework because of his lack of 
faith in my public school education.
He led me to our home office, found the story on the 
Moth’s website and soon enough, your voice started 
playing from our home computer as you told your 
prom story. On my first listen I remember thoroughly 
enjoying the story, but I remained skeptical. On one 
hand, there weren’t a lot Indian-Americans in show 
business. So as much as I enjoyed your story, I wasn’t 
sure if I’d hear anymore of your material in the future. 
On the other hand, I was very convinced that our prom 
experiences would be entirely different and your story 
was just an outlier. And even though I didn’t have 
a “trusty huffy,” when I found myself driving back 
home in my mom’s Chevy Malibu at 2 a.m. in drenched 
clothes after playing hours of BeanBoozled in my 
friend’s basement, the only thing I thought about was 
your story (you can imagine how my prom night went). 
Since my junior year, you’ve also delivered with 
your time on The Daily Show, your Netflix special 
Homecoming King and now with Patriot Act. 
Listening to your work eventually opened my eyes to 
something unique. It was the first time I had heard a 

person talking about their cultural identity in such a 
confident and relatable way. And even though I felt like 
I had a pretty good understanding of my culture, I still 
had a really hard time trying to express it and talking 
about it with other people, especially when I started 
high school. 
People don’t give you enough credit for how well 
you talk about your identity and the Indian American 
community. Being a second-generation immigrant 
is a very personal thing and can turn out to be an 
incredibly strange to talk about. Especially when 
you’re growing up and trying to figure it out for 
yourself. For example, in elementary school, one of the 
most common questions I’d get asked is why I didn’t 
eat beef. I’d also occasionally get made fun of whenever 
my mom would pack me Indian food for lunch while 
all of the cooler kids ate their Lunchables and wore 
clothes from the Gap. But in hindsight, you’ve got to 
give kids that age the benefit of the doubt. No matter 
how sensitive the topic, if an elementary schooler sees 
something they haven’t seen before, they’re going to 
ask you multiple inappropriate questions and throw 
tantrums for fun. They’re just curious kids who don’t 
know any better.
My dad’s job took my family to Bangalore, India for 
three years, which meant that I would attend middle 
school in India and move back to Ann Arbor halfway 
through the eighth grade. Questions of my cultural 
identity never really came up, because for once, I was 
part of a majority. I went to an international school 
where most of my issues came just from the experience 
that is middle school. Plus, I got really familiar with 
my culture and where my family was from. I got to 
experience a lot of the same things my parents did 
growing up. It was the first time I got to celebrate 
holidays with more family members than just my 
parents. When it was time for me to move back, I was 
a little nervous and sad because of the relationships I’d 
lose. But for the most part I knew moving back to Ann 
Arbor would be like a homecoming and that I could 
just pick up my life from where I had left it. However, 
I had not thought about how much living in another 
country for three years could change you.
I found this out in the most brutal and 
uncomfortable way possible. My very first class on 
arrival was Ms. Jender’s American History class. We 
were learning about the Trail of Tears and she asked 
the class for a volunteer to read a passage. Obviously, 
no one immediately volunteered and so Ms. Jender 
decided to wait until one of us did. I made the mistake 
of breaking the deadlock and read a passage that 
described some pretty horrifying things in a very thick 
Indian accent that I had picked up (Like, I’m talking 
multiple c’s guys). But by the time I was done reading, 

I looked up and the whole class held in their laughter. 
They all finally broke, when a guy from the back of the 
class said “Hey Apu! Thank you, come again!”. And at 
first I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. 
But in hindsight, that guy was just a dick, there really 
isn’t a doubt in my mind about that. 
In fact middle schoolers are probably the most 
terrifying people you could interact with. This isn’t 
solely from experience with dealing with other middle 
schoolers, it’s also from thinking about the stuff I 
was capable of doing myself. They’re at this weird age 
where we’d expect them to be at least a little mature, 
but anyone who does expect this is almost immediately 
disappointed.
Ironically, my first week in Ann Arbor was probably 
the week I felt most away from home. It was like 
everyone forgot that I had lived the majority of my life 
in Ann Arbor. Every teacher introduced themselves 
to me deliberately speaking in slow motion and over-
enunciating every word assuming I didn’t know 
English. A kid also told me they felt bad for me because 
they had seen Slumdog Millionaire. The funny thing 
is that when I had just moved to India and told people 
I was from America, everyone would look at me 
surprised that I wasn’t overweight because they had 
seen the movie Super-Size Me. When I then tried to 
explain to them that Ann Arbor was actually a nice 
place and that it was near Detroit, they would then 
respond in horrified expressions because the movie 8 
Mile was somehow popular amongst middle schoolers 
in India. So the stereotypes really go both ways on this 
one.
When I talked to my parents about this, my dad 
didn’t really react and told me to just wait it out and 
that things would come around. My mom, on the other 
hand, reacted in a completely opposite way. We started 
listening to NPR a lot more in the car and she would 
often make me repeat sentences or short phrases 
in Terry Gross’s accent. Using this accent, she also 
refused to talk to me in Hindi around the house (this 
rule excluded my dad or relatives on the phone). She 
also bought me a lot of clothes from American Eagle 
because she thought that would help. And for my first 
two years of high school, it really became a situation 
where I’d leave my cultural identity behind at home 
and when I went to school I just tried to do normal 
high school activities and do anything I could to fit in.
But something strange happened sometime 
between my senior year of high school and now. All of 
a sudden I’m really having my moment as a person of 
color. Going to college in Ann Arbor while also being 
from here has been a somewhat interesting experience. 
Because besides being deprived of fun, spontaneous 
college memories because your parents want you 

to live at home, I’ve been able to have very different 
relationships with this city as I age. And I don’t know 
if it just took 2-3 Indian restaurants or more hot yoga 
places to open up, but suddenly the cultural identity 
that I have worked to keep low-key has suddenly 
become very interesting to all of my friends. My 
friends come over to me and ask me questions about 
my culture (that aren’t offensive), like I’ve been leaving 
them out of the world’s best kept secret. Earlier this 
week in one of my classes, my friend asked me where’s 
the best place to get Samosas in a manner that someone 
would buy drugs at a public library. 
Other questions/remarks include “Hey I love the 
food at Cardamom, you must be so lucky eating Indian 
food at home” (I am lucky to eat Indian food at home 
because my mom makes it. And according to her if 
your favorite Indian dish is “Chicken Tikka Masala” 
or “Butter Chicken” from Cardamom, then you really 
aren’t eating Indian food. I’ll let you figure the rest out). 
“Where’s the best place to get Chai tea” (If you call it 
“Chai tea”, then you don’t deserve to know). “Is hot 
yoga, like, authentic?” (I don’t actually have an opinion 
on this one, so I guess the verdict is still out on this.) 
Now that I’m writing all of this down, I’ve realized 
that I’ve really become a real life version of a Yelp page 
for all things Indian. And honestly, I don’t mind it that 
much. I love the fact that I can share my culture with 
different people. Just make sure to give my reviews 5 
stars, don’t be shocked if I don’t know something and 
don’t be awkward about it. I’m not an encyclopaedia 
and nor should I or any other person of color be 
obligated to talk about their culture if they don’t want 
to. But I did start to sort of act like one. Maybe just a 
little.

A little over a year ago, I 
made the decision to switch 
to a vegan diet. This change 
has improved my mental and 
physical health, but it also 
had the people around me 
questioning my decision. My 
friends and family would 
ask me why I did it and how 
long I was doing it for, but my 
least favorite question of all is 
“what do you even eat?” These 
questions revealed to me that 
many of the people in my life 
thought that without animals, 

I could not sustain myself. My 
family members even saw this 
lifestyle change as a threat to 
my culture. They believed that 
a vegan diet meant I could no 
longer enjoy my mom’s Arabic 
cooking and that it would take 
away from my “Arab-ness.” 
All of these negative views 
of veganism are rooted in an 
innocent lack of knowledge, so 
in an attempt to combat that 
ignorance I will share some of 
my favorite Arabic vegan dishes 
that both sustain me and keep 
me in touch with my roots! 

This dish, though typically 
stuffed with meat and rice, can 
also be made by stuffing the 
grape leaves with vegetables 
and rice. I prefer to eat this 
cold, however some eat it 
warm as well.
The list of vegan Arabic 
dishes does not end here. 
There are so many vegan 
options in this cuisine, and 
even more options in other 
cuisines as well. Vegan food 
exists everywhere, you just 
have to look for it.

This classic dish is simply made of 
chickpeas, tahini, and garlic, making it 
vegan. It tastes amazing on its own, and 
even better with pita bread. 

This is another classic dish with the central 
ingredient also being chickpeas. It is a great 
meat substitute and when paired with tahini 
sauce, its flavor is unmatched.

The 2019 protests hinge on a 

common set of five demands:

1. Full withdrawal of the 

extradition bill.

2. A commission of inquiry into 

alleged police brutality.

3. Retracting the classification of 

protesters as “rioters.”

4. Amnesty for arrested 

protesters.

5. Dual universal suffrage, 

meaning for both the Legislative 

Council and the Chief Executive.

We cannot continue to fail our suvivors

“

Now that we are speaking, 
let us never shut up about 
this kind of thing. I speak 
up to make certain that this is 
not the kind of misconduct that 
deserves a second chance. I 
speak up to contribute to the end 
of the conspiracy of silence.”
This is from the very end of 
actress Lupita Nyong’o’s op-ed on 
her one-on-one encounters with 
producer Harvey Weinstein in 
The New York Times published 
back in 2017. I reread it now 
and then to better understand 
her story, as it likely shaped her 
as a woman and actress. Maybe 
it’s because I feel that I owe her 
and all the women at least that 
much. No matter how many 
times I try to read it I find myself 
wondering: Where did we fail 
her? How do we continue to fail 
every single female warrior who 
has come forward with their 
truth? I struggle to read through 
all the #MeToo stories because 
I already know the sequence of 
events that follows extremely 
vulnerable, 
courageous 
acts 
like Nyong’o’s: The story gains 
plenty of traction, elicits a strong 
response (typically more so from 
women) but then is forgotten 
over time. Where is the justice in 
this? It is unimaginably difficult 
to offer the world your personal 
story and to speak up about a 
deeply personal experience. 
More specifically, the female 
voices stepping forward from 
the film industry to share their 
harrowing 
experiences 
with 
Weinstein 
deserve 
justice. 
There’s 
a 
power 
difference 
between these actresses and 
Weinstein here that cannot go 
unnoticed. It’s an unfortunate 
thematic 
element 
of 
most 
sexual assault narratives. So 
let’s call it exactly like it is: 
Harvey Weinstein is a white, 
heterosexual established male 
in 
a 
challenging 
industry 
who preys on young, early-
professional women. It brings to 
light the disadvantaged position 
women — and women of color 
in particular — are placed in 
from the moment they choose 

to enter a career in Hollywood.
Every story I read, I am 
taken aback by the confidence 
Weinstein 
presumably 
held: 
the very same confidence that 
drove his ability to mentally 
manipulate budding stars and 
to toy with their passions and 
life paths. Based on the social 
identities he holds, it is not a 
coincidence that he also holds 
dominance 
in 
the 
industry 
and therefore he is cushioned 
by his success. The power 
dynamics are important here 
because what he did is worse 
than 
simply 
disrespecting 
women; he disrespected their 
hard work. It’s the same reason 
why Weinstein is able to plead 

not guilty despite the damning 
evidence and the same reason 
why he’s comfortable making 
a public appearance though he 
is soon to be on trial and faces 
rape allegations. 
Just the other week, at 
Rutgers University, a minor 
was arrested for sneaking into 
the Livingston dormitory on 
campus and sexually assaulting 
a college student. What scares 
me is that, as I read this, I 
didn’t feel phased by the story. 
It wasn’t until I read a follow-
up on the case a few days later 
that I reflected and began to 
feel disturbed by the young 
age of the assailant and the 
fact that this took place in 
what’s supposed to be a safe, 
on-campus location with card 
swipes and security. Stories 
like this are happening all the 

time, all over the world, and 
while there is media coverage 
of higher-profile situations, 
it doesn’t seem there are any 
steps taken to prevent this 
from happening again and 
again. This is the crux of the 
situation. When, and how do 
we start making strides to fix 
it?
I particularly struggle to 
read 
the 
Weinstein-related 
sexual 
harassment 
stories 
because 
I 
always 
wonder 
how Weinstein changed the 
feelings of his victims toward 
their hard-earned work. I 
learn about the strong women 
behind the words and I want 
to help them in the only way 
that I can: I want their stories 
to be heard and I want it to be 
their narrative. Sharing stories 
is an incredible and powerful 
practice and I am proud that 
there are mediums and safe 
spaces for these stories to 
be shared, increasingly so 
in contrast to the rest of the 
world. Yet, there needs to be 
a purpose to sharing these 
stories. There needs to be some 
reciprocation from the social 
justice end. 
We cannot afford to let 
Weinstein 
slip 
through 
the cracks. We cannot let 
Weinstein 
re-enter 
the 
public 
sphere. 
We 
cannot 
continuously fail the victims 
of sexual assault. We cannot 
continue to only listen to these 
voices and then not confront 
reality. The justice system is 
absolutely failing our victims, 
but so are we. We must actively 
support and advocate for the 
victims, as victims shouldn’t 
be the only advocates. So until 
Weinstein goes to trial on Jan. 
6, 2020, don’t just sit back and 
watch what happens. Educate 
yourself on the allegations, 
read the victim cases and 
actively support the survivors 
who bravely share a piece of 
themselves with us.

Billionaire tears
I

n early November, Michael 
Bloomberg, billionaire and 
former mayor of New York 
City, entered the 2020 Democratic 
primary for president of the United 
States. Bloomberg entered the race 
to add to the moderate lane because 
apparently one billionaire and 
another mayor of New York City just 
weren’t enough. 
Bloomberg’s entry into the race 
could be motivated by concerns 
about the rise of Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren, D-Mass., and her wealth 
tax, which would tax two cents 
on every dollar of one’s assets 
beyond $50 million. This policy 
would 
disproportionately 
affect 
billionaires, because billionaires 
own a disproportionate amount of 
wealth in the U.S. In fact, the top 
three richest men in America — 
Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren 
Buffett — own more wealth than 
the entire bottom 50 percent of 
the U.S. population, which is about 
160 million people. It is important 
to note that gender and racial 
disparities in wealth inequality are 
particularly prevalent in the U.S. Yet, 
Bloomberg isn’t alone in attacking 
Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 
stances against billionaires. In fact, 
Bloomberg’s 
fellow 
billionaires 
Leon Cooperman, Gates, Mark 
Zuckerberg, Ken Lagone and Jamie 
Dimon have also criticized Warren 
and Sanders for their commentary 
on billionaires. 
Coopeman came out in support 
of Bloomberg’s candidacy, saying: 
“He understands how the world 
works. He’s not a hater.” 
Later in the month, Cooperman 
responded to an ad by Warren’s 
campaign 
that 
addressed 
billionaires, 
saying: 
“She’s 
disgraceful. She doesn’t know who 
the f*** she’s tweeting. I gave away 
more in the year than she has in her 
whole f***ing lifetime.” 
The billionaire feels threatened. 
Poor billionaires. Well, except for 
the fact that neither Warren nor 
Sanders’ tax policies for billionaires 
would substantially reduce their 
amount of money. 
In response to the growing 
whining by billionaires, Warren 
released 
her 
billionaire 
tax 
calculator. It has ready calculations 
of how much billionaires like 
Bloomberg and Republican donor 
Charles Koch would pay under her 

wealth tax. Bloomberg’s estimated 
net worth is about $54 billion; 
he would pay about $3 billion in 
taxes, leaving him with a meager 
$51 billion. Gates, who recently 
complained about Warren taxing 
him $100 billion, would be taxed 
about $6 billion, leaving him with a 
paltry $101 billion. 
Some argue that we should 
be 
thankful 
for 
philanthropic 
billionaires like Bill Gates. Gates, 
famous for being a co-founder of 
Microsoft, also co-founded the Bill 
and Melinda Gates Foundation. It 
wasn’t for purely altruistic motives, 
though. 
Anand 
Giridharadas, 
author of “Winners Take All: The 
Elite Charade of Changing the 
World,” has said, “Gates was the 
first one who really started and 
shifted his image really drastically 
from sort of … well, Darth Vader (by 
engaging in philanthropy).” 

To 
be 
fair, 
the 
Gates 
Foundation has done a lot of good 
in the public health realm — such 
as supporting efforts to eradicate 
malaria, improving access to 
vaccines and expanding access 
to contraception worldwide. Still, 
Bill and Melinda Gates donated 
only $4.78 billion in 2017, which 
is about a billion and a half less 
than what they would pay under 
Warren’s wealth tax. It is also 
important to note a billionaire’s 
philanthropic 
donations 
are 
not guaranteed; they could stop 
flowing or significantly decrease 
at any moment. Philanthropy is 
not a substitute for taxation. A 
plan like Warren’s or Sanders’ 
would guarantee they pay their 
fair share to society. 
Warren’s wealth tax could be 
used to fund universal childcare, 
student loan debt cancellation, 
universal free college and more. 
Her six-cent tax on every dollar 
in net worth over $1 billion will 

be used to pay for Medicare 
For All, which would guarantee 
health care to every single 
American as a basic human 
right. 
What’s 
really 
frustrating 
about this entire conversation 
is that we are only listening to 
these people because they have 
a lot of money. Billionaire Tom 
Steyer has bought his place on to 
the Democratic debate stage — 
by spending $10 million dollars 
just to gain $1 from the required 
130,000 donors — and continues 
to survive in the race because 
he can spend millions on TV 
ads. Being the CEO of a popular 
coffee company or being a hedge 
fund manager does not make 
you qualified to be president of 
the U.S. any more than being a 
reality TV host and fraudulent 
real estate businessman does. 
Why aren’t we seeing the 
same amount of — or more — 
coverage of people whom these 
policies would help? Where 
are the interviews of people 
working three jobs to support 
their families or those who are 
being crushed with medical 
debt? Why do we care more 
about the opinions of a few rich 
people than the millions who 
are not insured at all or the 45 
million people who would have 
their student loan debt canceled 
under Warren’s policy?
Well, 
Americans 
are 
particularly inclined to love rags-
to-riches stories and find rich 
people aspirational. Millionaires 
and billionaires are ostensibly 
the American dream come true. 
And yet, economic inequality 
hurts everyone, even the rich.
Bloomberg’s entry into the 
primary — and the collective 
tears 
of 
billionaires 
— 
is 
emblematic of how people who 
are empowered by the status quo 
will always work to maintain that 
status quo. Power is hard to let 
go. They’ll dig their heels in and 
clench their firsts, but we can 
change the systems that allow the 
rich to get richer while the rest of 
us get poorer. The billionaires are 
scared. And that’s how we know 
we’ve got ‘em.

How rehab facilities fail their patients
I

n her new podcast series 
“Last Day”, author and 
activist Stephanie Wittels 
Wachs introduces listeners to 
her younger brother, Harris 
Wittels. She begins by detailing 
Wittels’s 
almost 
meteoric 
rise to success as a comedy 
writer, beginning with his 
first major writing job at age 
22 for “The Sarah Silverman 
Program.” From there, Wittels 
was hired as a staff writer for 
NBC’s “Parks and Recreation,” 
where he eventually became 
executive producer. In this 
time period, he coined the 
term 
“humblebrag,” 
which 
eventually 
entered 
the 
dictionary and was the basis 
for a book he later published. 
As “Parks and Recreation” 
approached its series finale, 
Wittels was set to move to 
New York City to co-star in 
and write for Aziz Ansari’s 
acclaimed 
series 
“Master 
of None.” But less than a 
week before the “Parks and 
Recreation” 
final 
episode 
aired, Wittels died of a heroin 
overdose at the age of 30.
What many in his life did not 
know was that throughout his 
various successes, Wittels had 
been struggling with substance 
abuse of opioids stemming 
from a previous back injury. 
He had entered and completed 
a 
rehabilitation 
program, 
which 
was 
successful 
for 
some time before he suffered 
a 
relapse. 
Soon, 
Wittels 
turned to injecting heroin for 
a cheaper, stronger high. By 
the time of his death, Wittels 
had completed three stints 
in 
different 
rehabilitation 
facilities. 
The three-time failure of 
rehabilitation 
facilities 
to 
provide lasting recovery for 
Wittels is not an isolated 
case. In fact, between 40 
to 60 percent of those with 
substance abuse problems who 
enter treatment experience 
relapse. The reason for these 
failures is not because of an 
inability on the part of the 
patient to get clean, but an 
institutional failure on the 
part of the facility to provide 
therapeutic 
processes 
that 
actually work. In the United 
States 
today, 
rehabilitation 
for drug and alcohol abuse 
disorders is a multi-billion 
dollar industry, yet it is also 
an 
industry 
that 
fails 
in 
providing lasting recovery for 
those seeking help. In order 
to remedy this issue, society 
must look into why these 
facilities have been able to get 
away with their failures and 
hold them accountable for the 
lack of standards that lead to 
an ineffective system.
For individuals dealing with 
substance 
abuse 
disorders, 
rehabilitation centers are the 
first step on a difficult path to 
recovery. However, there is no 
nationally accepted definition 
of standards for rehabilitation 
facilities. 
This 
lack 
of 
definition means that there 
are no federally regulated 

standards that facilities have 
to meet to be considered 
a 
legally 
sanctioned 
rehabilitation 
center. 
The field of treatment for 
addiction is overwhelmingly 
underregulated and under-
supervised. In many states, 
the process of becoming an 
addiction counselor does not 
even require that one gets 
a high school degree or has 
any specialized training. As a 
result, rehabilitation centers 
continue using old treatment 
programs that do not have 
scientific 
evidence 
that 
supports their effectiveness. 
To 
understand 
the 
programs 
that 
abound 
in 
most rehabilitation facilities, 
it is important to be familiar 
with the “12-step program.” 
This program has been the 
gold standard in addiction 
treatment 
for 
decades. 
In fact, the exact 12-step 
program 
used 
today 
in 
Alcoholics Anonymous was 
first developed more than 
80 years ago, in a time when 
neuroscience was a fledgling 
field of study. Additionally, 
the program was developed to 
largely serve alcohol abusers 
participating 
in 
Alcoholics 
Anonymous, not those with 
addictions to drugs. Ruben 
Baler, a health scientist for 
the 
National 
Institute 
on 
Drug Abuse, emphasizes the 
popularity of these 12-step 
programs but states there is 
no scientific evidence they 
actually work. Baler further 
explains the only evidence 
used 
by 
rehabilitation 
facilities to prove the efficacy 
of such treatment programs is 
purely anecdotal.
The 
widespread 
use 
of 
the 
often 
ineffective 
12-step program is just one 
manifestation of failures in 
addiction treatment. A 2012 
study from the National Center 
on Addiction and Substance 
Abuse at Columbia University 
found that a low number 
of patients with alcohol or 
drug abuse disorders who 
seek 
treatment 
receive 
any care that even closely 
approximates 
evidence-
based care. Instead, many 
rehabilitation facilities pour 
their budgets into treatments 
like equine therapy. While 
such 
facilities 
boast 
the 
benefits of equine therapy as 
stress-relieving 
and 
mood-
boosting, there is no empirical 
data to support claims that 
they help in substance abuse 
recovery. 
In the face of antiquated 
treatment processes, it is no 
wonder why many patients 
at 
rehabilitation 
facilities 
relapse shortly after finishing 
treatment. 
However, 
many 
substance 
abuse 
treatment 
centers boast inflated success 
rates. In fact, many assert 
success 
rates 
of 
over 
80 
percent for their patients. 
Yet, when they are pushed to 
provide evidence to support 
these claims, they are unable 

to do so. In more realistic 
terms, 
the 
generally 
prevailing success rate for 
treatment programs is about 
30 percent. Even after the 
realization that 70 percent 
of patients receive no benefit 
from their time spent in 
rehabilitation 
centers, 
a 
figure many experts still 
believe is too low, the reality 
of rehabilitation treatment 
gets more abysmal. A 2015 
study found that patients who 
solely received psychological 
support in their treatment 
program are twice as likely 
to die from overdoses than 
those who receive opioid 
replacement 
medications 
such as methadone. Despite 
this, 
three-quarters 
of 
substance abuse patients are 
treated without the use of 
replacement medications. 
As the opioid epidemic 
continues 
to 
reach 
crisis 
proportions, the market for 
those in need of treatment 
is as large as ever. When 
done properly, rehabilitation 
centers have the power to 
change lives for the better. 
But a lack of accountability 
and scientific evidence for 
treatment efficacy combined 
with a desire to maximize 
profits create an industry 
that fails its patients. Those 
with 
substance 
disorders 
are led to believe that these 
facilities prioritize patient 
recovery. Yet the fact remains 
that there is more money in 
recurrent patient relapses for 
rehabilitation facilities than 
there is in long-term patient 
recovery. 
Perhaps 
this 
is 
the reason why treatment 
centers continue to utilize 
programs with no scientific 
evidence of their efficacy and 
simply perpetuate a cycle of 
patient recovery and relapse. 
It is a cycle that led to the 
death of Wittels, the famous 
musician Prince and millions 
of 
anonymous 
Americans 
seeking 
treatment. 
If 
rehabilitation centers want 
to become more capable of 
providing lasting recovery, 
they must abandon the 12-step 
program as a one-size-fits-
all 
model. 
Additionally, 
they must increase access 
to 
medication-assisted 
treatment with drugs like 
methadone as an acceptable 
treatment 
model, 
allowing 
patients to ease themselves 
into a longer lasting recovery. 
Finally, the American public 
must hold the rehabilitation 
industry 
accountable 
for 
its unethical practices and 
corruption. In its current 
form, rehabilitation processes 
provide inadequate care to 
give their patients lasting 
recovery. 
By 
implementing 
these changes to the system, 
those 
suffering 
from 
substance abuse disorders can 
access the recovery that is all 
too elusive to them today.

Big industry is broken. We all know that, and anyone that doesn’t 
is either a brainwashed minion for “the man” or not on social media, 
because exposing big industry is all anyone ever does these days. 
Although this trend is justified, it has begun to grow repetitive in the 
echo chamber that is social media. The four-episode Netflix series 
“Broken” takes on the exact same role as these anti-industry social 
media accounts, but more in the form of an educational packet rather 
than a documentary film. Upon first watch, there isn’t anything 
particularly revolutionary about it — it’s a classic documentary you 
might watch in high school when there’s a substitute teacher in class, 
or if you need something to 
fall asleep to.
The topics are interesting 
and relevant enough, but 
the show doesn’t try to 
make itself stand out as an 
investigative documentary. 
Instead, it rides the coattails 
of 
these 
relevant 
topics 
to relay information that 
could likely be found on 
the 
internet 
with 
some 
light digging. The first season focuses on counterfeit cosmetics, 
big vape, poorly constructed dressers and single-use plastics. 
The documentary never dives into deeper, darker parts of these 
industries, shying away from exposing them at their gritty core and 
the parts that consumers never could have imagined.
The documentary genre is one that’s difficult for filmmakers to 
navigate. Its intent is to inform, but it still has to tackle the same task 
of keeping the audience engaged and presenting their information 
in a stylistic way. “Broken” seems to avoid taking advantage of 
what new style and film technology has to offer and instead takes 
a traditional route, using dark filters and blue shading to indicate 
when something is supposed to be scary. My initial hopes for 
this documentary were reasonably high — after watching nature 
documentaries like “Blue Planet” and “Our Planet,” and touching 
into investigative documentaries, the genre that once was associated 
with boredom had slowly started to redeem itself. “Broken” is a 
reminder that the documentaries that stand out are just that — silver 
linings in a genre that remains mainly stagnant, struggling to find 
a balance between information and entertainment.
Like most informative materials these days, “Broken” also 
falls into the trap of being too preachy. While well-intentioned, 
it seems impossible to avoid feeling like you’re being lectured by 
some member of woke culture at every turn, and this intensified as 
I watched the counterfeit cosmetics episode of the documentary. 
After being presented with all this information about counterfeit 
cosmetics, how and by whom they’re produced, the episode 
concludes by repeatedly emphasizing that “the hands are in the 
consumer” and nobody else to fix this problem. This led me to 
wonder whether we really need a documentary like this right now. 
Exposure to the world’s larger-than-life and incredibly nuanced 
issues makes it easy for one to spiral into a fit of existential dread, 
and it doesn’t feel like another one of these woke culture preach 
sessions is really going to inspire the average consumer to change 
their habits more than they probably have already tried to for other 
pressing issues, such as climate change. It’s worth a try, perhaps, 
but again, “Broken” didn’t do enough to suddenly be “the one” that 
revolutionizes consumer behavior. There’s already so much shame 
against the consumer, can’t we hold producers just as responsible? 
It’s a chicken or the egg question, and this documentary fails to 
answer it to any level of satisfaction.

A ‘Broken’ industry

TV REVIEW

SOPHIA YOON
Daily Arts Writer

Prior to this week, I had no idea who Omar Souleyman was. 
I found his name scrolling through Metacritic and thought it 
sounded like one out of my high school yearbooks or my mom’s 
soap operas (I’m Arab). I didn’t assume many Arab musicians 
were very popular in the West, much less Arabic music. But 
that’s specifically the case for Souleyman. Starting as a Syrian 
wedding performer in 1994, he has since amassed well over 
500 albums over the course of his career. These records are a 
mix of live and studio recordings that gained traction across 
Northeastern Syria, and his stylings draw from a popular 
village folk music of the Levant called dabke, with a slight 
EDM-techno bend. He became a global force following his 2007 
release Highway to Hissake (Folk and Pop Sounds of Syria) under 
American record label Sublime Frequencies. His reach has only 
expanded from there as he made waves at the 2011 Glastonbury 
Music Festival and collaborated with western artists from 
Bjork to Gorillaz. He has now returned to the scene with the 
release of Shlon.
To preface, I will not carry this review on as Pitchfork so 
pretentiously did with their review of 2017’s To Syria, With 

Love, and credit his success as the result of any westernization 
of his work. Nor will I so much as suggest that “his ignorance 
of dabke is a prerequisite for his success,” as DJ Rupture did in 
his 2016 novel “Uproot.” Just 
as American and European 
artists found their fascination 
in 
the 
Japanese 
invention 
of synth-pop, the same goes 
for 
Arabs 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. Rather, I will consider 
Souleyman’s work as I would 
any other work of dabke.
Just as much as it is a genre 
of music, dabke is a form 
of dance. The two work to 
reinforce one another, almost 
inextricable in their pairing; 
there is no point to dabke music if you can’t dance to it. This 
idea radiates throughout Shlon. Clocking in with six songs in 
35 minutes, the album shouldn’t feel as long as it does. The 
effect is a result of placing the music and instruments at the 
very center of a song. The album embodies the standard maqam 
Bayati form with elaborate, layered introductions that can last 
over a minute long. The oud, mijwiz, tablah, daff and arghul 
all cascade melodiously over the ambient 
synths that linger beneath, receding ever 
so seamlessly in succession between one 
another. This is alongside the contributions 
of other Syrian contemporaries, namely 
Hassan Alo on keyboard and Azad Salih on 
saz.
Shlon takes these ritual elements of dabke 
up a notch by way of unbridled delight and 
ecstasy. Its title translates literally to “what 
color,” or more colloquially as “how,” as the 
overarching theme of the album is love and 
how it works. Souleyman takes dabke and 
warps it into his own brand, every song 
loud, energetic and punchy. It never feels 
contrived or aggressive, and Souleyman 
leaves 
ample 
room 
for 
more 
sparse 
moments. Most notably there is “Mawwal,” 
with its subtle, all-encompassing synth 
glowing throughout the entire track. Oud 
and mijwiz alternate with one flowing 
into the other to sustain the song’s energy 
throughout Souleyman’s singing until a daf 
solo that ends the song on a comforting note. 
Alternatively, its successor “Abou Zilif” 
radiates pure jubilance and enthusiasm, a 
pounding tablah and sharp arghul notes 
animating every moment. 
Souleyman 
croons 
short, 
flowery 
proclamations of love throughout every 

track over subtle handclaps that beg us to clap and groove 
along. These lyrics comprise a love poem written by Moussa Al 
Mardood in one sitting during a recording session. Souleyman’s 
gruff, full recitation of the 
poem pairs well with the 
complex mesh of synth and 
the 
fast-paced 
dabke 
and 
baladi on each track. This 
only makes sense with dabke’s 
true niche at weddings and 
other 
celebrations 
of 
love. 
Unfortunately, these lyrics do 
not translate well into English: 
“There are no eyebrows like 
hers / They are drawn like 
swords” can only really keep 
its true glamour in Arabic. 
Omar Souleyman strikes gold in combining the atmosphere 
and energy of an Arab wedding with the radiance of synthpop. 
By playing at the strengths of both genres, he balances them 
over one another to give each a chance to shine. Every moment 
of Shlon sparkles in awe and anticipation with a celebration and 
party in mind. This extends to rank Souleyman not only as a 
dynamic wedding singer, but a deft producer who can wield two 
worlds of music at once.

Disney had dipped its toes in the theme of girl-power 
before, with classics featuring strong leading ladies like 
“Mulan,” “Tangled” and “The Princess and the Frog,” but it 
wasn’t until the premiere of “Frozen” that the phenomenon of 
female empowerment in animated cinema was truly born. The 
release of “Frozen” sparked the demand for pale-blue, Elsa-
esque dresses and auburn, Anna-style braids and a record of 
“Let It Go” on a never-ending loop. A revolutionary tale, any 
“Frozen” sequel was destined to fall short of the original. 
Despite its memorable, Broadway-quality voiced characters 
and inventive plotline, “Frozen 2” still feels repetitive and 
doesn’t quite live up to its 
iconic predecessor. 
Picking 
up 
where 
“Frozen” left off, “Frozen 
2” begins in the kingdom 
of Arendelle, where Elsa’s 
(Idina 
Menzel, 
“Rent”) 
powers have been embraced 
by the people, Anna (Kristen 
Bell, “Veronica Mars”) and 
Kristoff (Jonathan Groff, 
“Mindhunter”) are happily 
coupled 
and 
sidekicks 
Olaf (Josh Gad, “Pixels”) 
and Sven the reindeer are 
perfectly content. At first, 
it seems that happily ever 
after has finally arrived. 
But 
when 
Elsa 
starts 
hearing mysterious voices 
calling to her in the night, 
it soon becomes clear that 
something isn’t right, and 
Arendelle is in jeopardy. 
To save the Kingdom from 
impending 
doom, 
Anna, 
Elsa, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven 
must journey to the enchanted forest, unveiling new truths 
about their pasts and setting the course for their futures with 
every step. 
Central to the success of “Frozen” were Anna and Elsa’s 
contrasting personalities and familial tension. Anna was the 

fun-loving, optimistic and wide-eyed little sister who just 
wanted love and adoration from her elder sister, whereas Elsa 
was the troubled, more-seasoned one perpetually trapped in a 
hero’s journey archetype. While the clash between the sisters 
was acceptable in “Frozen,” their constant bickering about 
protecting one another from danger and overall misalignment 
is tiring in “Frozen 2.” Each sister is always trying to protect 
the other, justifying irrationality with love. Though at first 
touching, the back and forth “I love you more” narrative 
quickly wears down and ultimately weakens the pacing of the 
film.
Aside from the characters, what “Frozen” was known and 
loved for was its unforgettable music. Much like the other 
elements of the film, “Frozen 2” dropped the ball on the 
music, failing to distinguish any one song as a hit. Despite 

Menzel and Bell’s outstanding vocals, the majority of numbers 
throughout the film are, to our disappointment, relatively 
unmemorable. Only time will tell whether any of the songs 
will stick, but it doesn’t look like any tunes will be deposing 
“Let It Go” from its musical throne.
In truth, there wasn’t anything 
wrong 
with 
“Frozen 
2.” 
But 
it 
didn’t wow, and that’s a standard 
all Disney sequels are (with good 
reason) expected to meet. More than 
anything, “Frozen 2” proves that 
it takes more than a new plotline 
and a fresh set of songs to craft an 
innovative sequel. While ages 10 and 
under will likely still appreciate the 
charm of Disney’s new release, older 
audiences will grimace at the lack of 
character evolution and catchy lyrics 
that it offers.

Don’t let them in, don’t let them see:
‘Frozen 2’ is nothing like its mother

If anyone’s lyrical progression throughout the decade 
warrants a chronological volume, it’s Mark Kozelek’s. “Nights 
of Passed Over II” collects the words from the singer-
songwriter’s prolific musical career over the past 10 years. 
The book picks up where his first previous collection left off. 
The cutoff point between the two anthologies 
may at first seem arbitrary, though Kozelek’s 
decision to begin in 2010 makes “Nights” 
an excellent documentation of arguably the 
most controversial lyrical progression of the 
decade. Love it or hate it, the collection is the 
best showcase of the artist’s singular lyrical 
journey.
Kozelek got his start in the late ’80s as 
the lead singer and songwriter in Red House 
Painters. The group was as close to a boy 
band as a band could get and still be beloved 
by future Elliott Smith fans. Kozelek left 
Red House Painters and started releasing 
songs under the name Sun Kil Moon in 2002. 
If any of those original Red House Painters 
fans were still on board by 2010, it’s hard to 
imagine they’re still here a decade later.
This 
anthology 
shows 
Kozelek’s 
contentious lyrical shift from traditional 
poetry laden with metaphor to increasingly 
literal accounts of his daily life. After a 
brief prologue, the book begins with Sun 
Kil Moon’s Admiral Fell Promises. The 
traditional poetic style of the lyrics sticks out 
when compared with the following works, 
but the contrast makes provides a nice pivot 
point. Jumpstarting the change is 2012’s 
Among The Leaves. Lyrics from “Sunshine In 
Chicago” and “I Know It’s Pathetic But That Was The Best 
Night Of My Life” show Kozelek writing episodic accounts of 
experiences during tour. 
It’s hard to say anything about 2014’s Benji — Kozelek’s 
next album — that hasn’t already been said, including the 
lament that there’s nothing left to say. The album showcases 
the power of direct nonfictional storytelling in addressing 
loss. Prompted by his aunt losing her father and daughter in 
two unrelated freak explosions of aerosol cans, the album is 
Kozelek’s tribute to his original home in lower-class Ohio. 
Without instrumentals, not one lyric’s gut punch is lost: “Was 
it even you who mistakenly put flammables in the trash? / Was 

it your kids just being kids? / If so oh the guilt that they will 
carry around forever.” The brilliance of Benji is in its ability to 
focus on diary-like accounts of life when affected by tragedy. 
Even as the lyrics forgo analysis for direct accounts, the 
choice in which stories will be told says everything. Alongside 

each other, the stories lament that humans’ fragile, expiring 
bodies are categorically underqualified to hold the lives that 
permeate through them. 
The lyrics in Universal Themes, when pushed onto paper, 
seem to stray further away from poetry and toward prose. 
But without the heavy subject matter of the preceding Benji, 
the stories feel inconsequential at times. Kozelek allegedly 
spent much of the album writing bored on a film set, and the 
resulting lyrics are about as fun to read as Mark is having 

writing them. “This is My First Day and I’m Indian and I Work 
at a Gas Station” is a highlight. The lyrics read much like the 
title: a long, drawn out account of random life moments. The 
song and all its sporadic lyrics really shouldn’t work, but it’s 
hard not to love something so unflinchingly unique.
2017’s Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood 
should also, not by any means, work. Perhaps it only does due 
to its varied subjects: the 2016 election, the mysterious death 
of Canadian Elisa Lam and gun control (to name a few). By 
this point, the poetry of Admiral has all but disappeared and 
has made room for long, winding prose. Kozelek reads full 
letters from fans or promoters, which are less surprising in 
book form. In theory, 
the last thing the world 
needed was another take 
on 2016 politics. And 
yet, 
Kozelek 
himself 
is 
the 
reason 
these 
long 
diatribes 
stay 
interesting. The appeal 
of 
his 
work 
beyond 
2017 is similar to the 
appeal of blogging. This 
is 
especially 
true 
in 
book form, without the 
varying instrumentation 
with each record. Song 
topics drift further and 
further into Kozelek’s 
daily 
life. 
The 
long, 
dairy-like entries will be 
too much for some. For 
those who have already 
put in the time to get to 
know Kozelek through 
his 
earlier 
releases, 
the records can feel like catching up with a new friend. 
Increasingly, Kozelek’s avoidance of poetry and metaphor 
works to his favor: their presentation with daily subject 
matter would enter melodramatic territory.
One issue of the book’s form that does hurt the experience 

is the lack of true cohesion. The book makes sense as a 
memoir which doubles as an account of artistic progression. 
However, there’s a certain amount of whiplash from putting 
the disparate albums together. Without walling off each 
album, there’s too much proximity between a lyrics like “she 
wanted love like anyone else … she had dreams like anyone 
else” and a song called “Suck My Cock War On Drugs.”
The latter song came from one of Kozelek’s rants, which 
vary from defending transgender rights to critiquing music 
bloggers. The over-aggression of some of 
these songs is established by Kozelek’s 
grounding of the majority of them in 
sympathy with the experiences of his friends 
and family. These often come alongside 
the rants, like linking his disdain for San 
Francisco techies with gentrification and 
aggression towards homeless people.
In “Shut Up and Play the Hits,” James 
Murphy highlights the surrealism of popular 
artists like David Bowie: “In my mind he 
was from outer space, like, he’s not a person. 
Like this isn’t a person that would wake up 
and whose foot would hurt because they 
kicked a couch the night before … The best 
you could do is just act like them … But you 
couldn’t be that.” It’s often jarring to find 
art that solely expresses themes contained 
in everyday life. Perhaps because popular 
artists don’t lead “normal” lives, or perhaps 
because people aren’t interested in the ones 
that do. 
But daily life outside of tragedy also 
should have its place in the artistic canon. 
By removing the artistic musical style, the 
bare lyrics depict daily life in a tone that 
reflects what it actually feels like for most 
people. Many people will find these lyrics 
self-indulgent. And perhaps they are. But 
it also allows Kozelek to touch on important subjects that 
wouldn’t otherwise be addressed. Life isn’t lived in the 
grand, memorable outliers expressed in most art. For the 
most part, it’s lived in the moments in between them. “Nights 
of Passed Over II” is a progression of an artist learning to 
express those moments.

South Africa (as I covered in a previous profile of House 
producer Black Coffee) has cemented its place as one of the 
world’s most innovative producers and exporters of dance music. 
By now, the particular brand of deep house championed by the 
aforementioned Black Coffee as well as producers such as Da 
Capo are mainstays at clubs pretty much everywhere. One of 
the newest and most exciting waves of music coming from the 
country, in particular the coastal metropolis of Durban, is a 
genre called gqom. 
Gqom, roughly pronounced “qwom” (although it involves a 
click sound present in the Zulu language), is one of those forms 
of brilliant dance music that harkens and 
celebrates an apocalypse or impending 
doom, a far cry from the sunny House of 
an Ibiza dancefloor. A typical gqom track 
builds around only a few elements, typically 
a single synth pattern or mangled sample 
as well as a powerful, decidedly atypical 
4/4 drum pattern. The latter in particular 
creates a lack of stability that gives rise to 
a rather hypnotic and disorienting feeling, 
one unlike any other I’ve ever heard or 
experienced. While UK Garage is notable 
for its rhythmic “pushes,” even it has a very 
solid and noticeable rhythmic core. Gqom, 
on the other hand, features a similar type 
of “broken” beat but with a more intricate 
system of polyrhythms floating in and out 
and interacting with each other all at once. 
The sounds of gqom were discovered 
and developed by teenagers in these 
Durban townships (apparently often using cracked copies of 
FruityLoops production software) and spread in a labyrinthine 
network of music hosting sites, Facebook and WhatsApp groups. 
In some instances, tracks spread without the help of the internet 

by just being played by groups of people out and about or even in 
taxis. With regards to the latter, DJ Lag, one of the genre’s most 
successful practitioners, mentions that “If a track is being played 
in a taxi, you should know that your track is a hit,” since “taxis 
are a symbol of dancing mood, especially taxis that work in the 
heart of Durban. And taxis actually are the heart of Durban 
especially in promoting gqom music.” One of the most intriguing 
and appealing aspects of the genre is the fact it is, for all intents 
and purposes, completely organic and DIY, a rarity in a world of 
industry plants and mega-studios. 
Durban itself is the third largest city in South Africa after 
Johannesburg and Cape Town, and the largest city in the 
province of KwaZulu-Natal. Like many large South African 
cities, the horrors of apartheid still remain under the surface, 
and many of the “townships” surrounding the city remain, on 
average, much poorer and less developed. 
However, they remain a source of much 
of the new music being produced in the 
countries and provide an invaluable 
audience and party scene for dance music 
producers. Many producers note that the 
inherent darkness of their music reflects 
the uneasy tension between the desire to 
celebrate and the poverty, violence and 
lack of opportunity that are widespread in 
the areas they grow up in.
Gqom’s spread outside of South Africa, 
on the other hand, was facilitated in 
largely by a Rome-based DJ named Nan 
Kolè, who helped start a label called Gqom 
Oh! that released a compilation of gqom 
music created in the Durban townships 
for audiences outside of South Africa that 
doesn’t involve navigating the genre’s 
complex, fast-changing online ecosystem. 
Its success has even spawned the birth of new fusions of 
disparate sounds elsewhere in the continent, and points to 
an exciting future in which more unconventional sounds are 
played in clubs around the world.

FOR JIM HARBAUGH, THE QUESTIONS ARE THE INSULTS

Monday, December 2, 2019 | michigandaily.com

As the seconds continued to churn 

off the second-half clock Saturday, a sea 

of red began to funnel down the rows of 

Michigan Stadium. Chants of O-H-I-O 

from the traveling fan base rained down, 

and the locals filed for the exits.

The scoreboard was lopsided, and it 

would only grow moreso. The visiting 

sideline stayed composed because 

they’ve got more business to attend to in 

the coming weeks, and because nearly 

every one of them had been in this 

spot before, trouncing their supposed 

archrival. 

It was a scene that could’ve been 

ripped straight from last year’s script, 

nearly verbatim.

After a 33-yard touchdown extended 

the Buckeyes’ lead to 56-27, where it 

would stay when the clock hit zero, 

sophomore defensive end Aidan 

Hutchinson walked off the field, arms to 

his side, fists balled in rage, screaming 

to everyone and no one in particular. He 

looked up at the sky and screamed there, 

too.

“I didn’t see this coming,” Hutchinson 

would say later, choking back those 

emotions after Michigan’s 15th loss to 

the Buckeyes in 16 years.

“No one’s happy,” added senior tight 

end Sean McKeon. “(It’s) definitely really 

frustrating, especially for the seniors. It’s 

just kind of the same thing every year. 

Gotta execute better, and yeah it gets old, 

but just gotta play better against them.”

It’s easy to sit here and quibble 

about the particulars — about how 

three mistakes in the second quarter 

potentially accounted for an 18-point 

swing; about how senior quarterback 

Shea Patterson completed just four of 

24 second-half passes; about how the 

defense relented 577 yards and 56 points 

a year after allowed 567 yards and 62 

points; about a fourth-and-1 play call, 

and about nearly 100 before it; about how 

a team that fleetingly looked like it could 

compete was instead run off the field 

and shoved into another offseason of 

unanswerable questions.

But those would be mere quibbles, 

drowned out by the cacophony of reality, 

which is as follows: 

This fanbase and this program 

measures itself against one program. 

That program is one of the three best 

programs in the country. Michigan is 

not.

Ohio State recruits at a higher level. 

It executes at a higher level. And for 

now, it is the singular force keeping 

the Wolverines from contending for 

titles most fans expect. That “level” is 

a nearly-impossible one to reach, and 

the Wolverines have found themselves 

hitting a really-good-but-not-great 

plateau in their attempts to climb there. 

Twisting the dynamic of the “rivalry” 

into any other framework would be 

willful self-delusion.

Asked if that chasm instills a mental 

hurdle in Michigan’s players — some of 

whom have experienced just two wins 

over Ohio State in their lives — fifth-year 

senior Jordan Glasgow rebuffed.

“I can’t really speak for the other 

players, only myself in that aspect, but 

personally I don’t feel like that’s the 

case,” Glasgow said. “There’s a streak. 

It’s a bunch of individual games and 

they’ve been able to continue it on for 

the last 7-8 years. We just weren’t able 

to execute. As you said, execution plays 

a big role, the biggest role in every game. 

We just weren’t able to do that today.”

Today, or 15 of the last 16 tries.

Ultimately, trekking that steep 

mountain falls on Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh — who now drops to 0-5 in 

his tenure against the team he’s paid a 

hefty sum to beat. It would be wrong 

to insinuate he’s been complacent in 

those attempts. After being gashed for 

369 rushing yards in 2015, Harbaugh 

turned around and hired Don Brown, 

who held the Buckeyes at bay in 2016. 

After watching Ohio State’s offense 

gash Michigan with quick tempo and 

alarming ease, he went out and entrusted 

an offensive overhaul to Josh Gattis, who 

hoped to mirror those traits. There will 

surely be changes in the offing, attempts 

to remedy yet another deep wound. 

Every week-to-week tweak, every 

wholesale change, every bit of evolution 

comes with one goal in mind.

When that goal never comes to 

fruition, vexation builds.

“It’s very, very frustrating,” Patterson 

said. “What we do all year leading to 

this game is for them. We know it’s an 

emotional game.”

Then he glanced to his left, peering 

at sophomore running back Hassan 

Haskins: “Luckily Hassan’s got a few 

more shots at them.”

After the game, a reporter asked if the 

disparity between the programs was the 

result of “a talent gap, a preparation gap, 

a coaching gap” or another factor.

Harbaugh glanced straight ahead and 

shot back.

“I’ll answer your questions, not your 

insults.”

At this point, they’re one and the 

same.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

W

hen it all ended, 
when the blowout 
was codified and 
the Michigan football team 
was taking a 
never-ending 
walk up the 
tunnel, Ohio 
State ran to 
the nearest 
end zone. 
They linked 
arms and 
swayed, the 
band giving 
the music, a 
sea of fans 
clad in red — the only ones still 
left in Michigan Stadium — 
supplying the vocals to “Carmen 
Ohio.”
It all felt like a repeat, because 
it was. A repeat of last year, when 
“Harbaugh sucks” chants rattled 
around the Horseshoe after a 
62-39 Ohio State blowout win. 
A repeat of the year before that, 
when the Wolverines let Dwayne 
Haskins take control after 
coming into the game as a backup 
and walk out with a 31-20 win. A 
repeat of the last eight years, over 
which Ohio State has outscored 
Michigan a combined 331-216 
without dropping a single edition 
of this now-annual ruination. A 
repeat of the last 16 years, over 
which the Buckeyes have won 15 
of these, the only loss coming in 
a transition year between scarlet 
and gray dynasties.
This is what this rivalry is. 
This is what Ohio State is, and 
this is what Michigan is. A 56-27 
drubbing. Jim Harbaugh sitting 
at one podium saying, “They 
played better today.” Ryan Day 
sitting at the other saying, “In 
games like this, it comes down 
to players. Our big-time players 
played well.” The Wolverines 
slowly walking off the field. 
The Buckeyes linking arms and 
singing their alma mater.
If you think it’s any different, 
you haven’t been paying 
attention.
This isn’t a Jim Harbaugh 

problem, a Shea Patterson 
problem or a Don Brown 
problem. Harbaugh brought 
Michigan to 10 wins in three 
of his first four years and still 
has a chance to do it for a 
fourth time — more than on 
par with what the Wolverines 
did regularly before a six-year 
Rich Rodriguez/Brady Hoke 
odyssey sunk the program to new 
depths. Patterson set a record 
on Saturday for the most passing 
yards a Michigan quarterback 
has ever had over three games. 
Brown’s defense has been top-
10 in SP+ every year since he’s 
come to Ann Arbor, and even 
after Saturday, it’s on pace to do 
so again.
Since 1969, the start of the 
Bo Schembechler era, Michigan 
has averaged 9.44 wins per year. 
Harbaugh has 47 in five years 
— 9.4 per year. You want him to 
restore this program to what it 
was under Bo? Check. Harbaugh 
has the Wolverines right where 
they’ve always been.
It’s not Michigan that’s 
changed. It’s Ohio State.
In that same 50-year span, 
the Buckeyes have averaged 9.78 
wins per year. Since Jim Tressel 
took over the program in 2001, 
that number has rocketed up 
to an even 11. Since Harbaugh 
took over Michigan in 2015, that 
number is at 11.8. It’s a whole 
different stratosphere than 
Michigan, and it’s been borne out 
on the field.
“It’s just kind of the same 
thing every year,” senior tight 
end Sean McKeon said. “Gotta 
execute better, and yeah it gets 
old, but just gotta play better 
against them.”
But the gap goes beyond 
execution and just playing 
better. In the Harbaugh era, the 
Buckeyes have out-recruited 
Michigan in all but one year, per 
247Sports’ composite rankings. 
They’ve landed four top-five 
classes (including 2020). The 
Wolverines have landed one, 
in 2017, and failed to get the 

production they could have out of 
it. Want to find the difference on 
the field Saturday? Look there.
On defense, the Buckeyes 
landed five-stars Chase Young 
and Jeffrey Okudah, two future 
top-10 picks in the NFL Draft. 
Young didn’t fill the statsheet on 
Saturday, but set an Ohio State 
record with 16.5 sacks this year 
and will likely be a Heisman 
Trophy finalist. Okudah held 
Nico Collins, Michigan’s best 
receiver, to two catches for 42 
yards. On offense, the Buckeyes 
also landed J.K. Dobbins, who 
ran for 211 yards, and three 
starters on an offensive line that 
paved the Wolverines all day 
long.
Michigan got two five-stars 
in that class: Donovan Peoples-
Jones, who caught three balls 
for 69 yards and accounted for a 
number of second-half drops on 
Saturday, and Aubrey Solomon, 

who transferred to Tennessee 
before the season. Of its 19 four-
stars in 2017, just three — Collins, 
cornerback Ambry Thomas and 
center Cesar Ruiz — started 
and made a tangible impact on 
Saturday. Eight are no longer 
with the program.
The 2016 season and that 
next recruiting class was 
the Wolverines’ chance to 
narrow the gap, to capitalize 
on two years of building hype 
around Harbaugh and position 
themselves as real contenders to 
the Buckeyes. Instead, they were 
inches from beating Ohio State, 
failed to get everything they 
could from the next recruiting 
class, and now, this is just reality.
Ohio State is one of the best 
three or four programs in the 
country every year. Michigan 
is one of the best 14 or 15 every 
year. Harbaugh is a very good 
football coach who got the 

Wolverines back to this level. But 
there’s only so many Jim Tressels 
and Urban Meyers.
Before them, both programs 
could count themselves in that 
tier of programs good enough to 
get nine or 10 wins annually and 
compete for a title every so often. 
Then the Buckeyes took a leap. 
The Wolverines couldn’t make 
the same jump.
Saturday is just what generally 
happens when a top-four team 
plays a top-15 team. So is nearly 
every iteration of this game in 
the 21st century.
“We knew we had the athletes 
and the players to get the job 
done,” former Ohio State receiver 
Parris Campbell told The Daily a 
month ago.
He was talking about the 2018 
game, when the Buckeyes gashed 
Brown’s corners with crossing 
routes for 396 passing yards. He 
might as well have been talking 

about most of the 15 games prior, 
or predicting the future.
This isn’t a gap that gets 
bridged in one year. It’s one that 
takes a recruiting cycle, and 
maybe more than one, to mend. 
And to get that kind of recruiting 
cycle, the kind it takes to beat 
Ohio State, Harbaugh needs to 
… beat Ohio State. Thus is borne 
the never-ending cycle Michigan 
finds itself facing. Get lucky once, 
or find itself unable to meet an 
impossible expectation.
“We didn’t really put them in 
a position to be of pressure on 
them,” Harbaugh said. “And they 
played really well. They made 
those plays, they made those 
drives, they got those stops.”
If he wants to fix that, it’ll take 
far more than a few adjustments 
on a whiteboard.

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily
The Michigan football team lost its eighth-straight game against Ohio State on Saturday, a marker of the level of both programs over the last 15 years.

Offense goes quiet in second half

Shea 
Patterson 
took 
the 
snap at Ohio State’s 16 early 
in the second quarter, hoping 
to convert third down and 
potentially 
bring 
Michigan 
within two points.
But he dropped the ball, and 
a Buckeye fell on it. You’ve seen 
that before.
What happened next should 
be familiar, too.
After staying with Ohio State 
in the first quarter, trading 
blow for blow, the offense 
went quiet. Mistakes piled up. 
The Wolverines scored just 
11 points in the second half. 
Jim Harbaugh spent nearly 
two minutes after the game 
diagnosing the problems: red 
zone issues, lack of momentum, 
not making plays.
But the phrase everyone who 
spoke to the media used more 
than any other was we didn’t 
execute. That about summed it 
up.
When the dust cleared on a 
56-27 loss, Michigan’s eighth-
straight to the Buckeyes, it 
was clear: the Wolverines may 
have had a new look offense 
complete with a flashy hashtag 
and some gaudy stats against 
mid-tier teams, but it wasn’t 
good enough to keep up with 
Ohio State. Again.
“It was in just the second 
half, a few errors,” Patterson 
said. “ … You just gotta play the 
same way for four quarters, not 
just two or three.”
At the end of the second half, 
Patterson found junior receiver 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
in 
the end zone for a would-be 
touchdown — would be, if 
Peoples-Jones hadn’t dropped 
it. Michigan was forced to kick 
a field goal.
Peoples-Jones had two more 
drops in the third quarter. 
Sophomore 
receiver 
Ronnie 
Bell had one, too, when a catch 
would’ve 
converted 
third-
and-16. Even when Patterson 
tried to put the team on his 
back, the receivers didn’t hold 
up their end of the deal.
“Just 
made 
too 
many 
mistakes. Too many drops,” 

said senior tight end Sean 
McKeon. “ … Just gotta be 
confident in catching the ball. 
Gotta make the tough plays, the 
one-one-one matchups.”
Other times, the Buckeyes 
simply 
made 
plays. 
The 
Wolverines’ receivers are big, 
strong, athletic.
But they hadn’t faced a 
secondary like Ohio State’s, 
either. And when it came to 
50-50 balls, for the first time all 
season, Michigan 
was on the wrong 
side of the coin.
And that’s not 
even to speak for 
the 
run 
game. 
The 
Wolverines 
rushed for just 
91 
yards 
and 
struggled 
to 
get 
anything 
going 
on 
that 
side of the ball 
the entire game. No play was 
more emblematic of that than 
an 
attempted 
fourth-and-1 
conversion 
in 
the 
fourth 
quarter, 
when 
Michigan 
attempted to run a wildcat play 
and opened a gaping hole for 
Hassan Haskins — but Haskins 
didn’t see it and got stuffed.
With the run game struggling 
to get off the ground and the 
Wolverines down big in the 
second half, the Buckeyes could 
focus their game plan on trying 
to stop Michigan’s receivers. 
They did just that.
“Just gotta find a way to get 

on top and play with a lead if 
they allow you to on offense,” 
McKeon said. “… Can’t afford 
to throw the ball every play. It 
closes off half our offense.”
Meanwhile, on the other 
end of the field, Ohio State 
put star running back J.K. 
Dobbins in a position to run 
wild. Quarterback Justin Fields 
picked his spots and took his 
shots and converted every time.
The Buckeyes were a more 
talented team, 
yes 
— 
with 
three 
legit 
Heisman 
candidates and 
a glut of five-
star 
talent. 
They didn’t get 
ranked No. 1 
in the College 
Football 
Playoff poll for 
nothing.
But on Saturday, they were 
also the better team. The team 
that made fewer mistakes.
“They definitely made deep 
shots when we didn’t, took 
more deep shots, coverage on 
those, it was kinda deflating 
to our defense,” McKeon said. 
“They converted on all of their 
red zone drives, converted 
touchdowns. We didn’t.”
Ohio State executed, plain 
and simple — and in doing so, 
showed 
Michigan 
what 
its 
offense wants to be, but has 
never quite actually been.
You’ve seen that before.

ARIA GERSON
Daily Sports Editor

ALEC COHEN/Daily
Shea Patterson said Michigan struggled to keep the same level all game.

Just made too 
many mistakes. 
Too many 
drops.

Once again, ‘M’ defense falls flat

Jim Harbaugh brought his 
hands to hips, an empty stare 
glued to his face.
If he had looked forward, he 
would’ve seen Ohio State running 
back J.K. Dobbins leaping into the 
end zone, sparking pandemonium 
from the sea of red behind him.
Instead, 
Harbaugh 
looked 
down, training his eyes toward his 
playbook, seemingly in search of 
answers.
For the eighth-straight year 
— and fifth in Harbaugh’s five 
seasons — there were none. Just 
a 56-27 defeat, further cementing 
the balance of power in a rivalry 
that leaves Michigan searching for 
its soul every November.
It’s a program that, as long as 
Harbaugh has been here, has hung 
its identity on its defense. Every 
year, its defense is lauded as one 
of the nation’s best. Every year, 
its defense is the reason it thinks 
it can beat Ohio State. Every year, 
the stats back those assertions up 
through 11 weeks.
And then this game comes, 
obliterating those misconceptions 
and exposing the talent gap that 
the 
Wolverines 
spend 
three 
months dismissing.
“They’re a very talented team, 
obviously, (have been) throughout 
the entire year,” said fifth-year 
senior linebacker Jordan Glasgow. 
“But we’re just as talented, I feel 
like.”
Minutes 
earlier, 
sophomore 
defensive end Aidan Hutchinson 

sat in the same seat, rejecting the 
notion that defensive coordinator 
Don Brown’s scheme was at fault.
“It’s not scheme, we just gotta 
execute,” Hutchinson said. “That’s 
it.”
The answer most likely lies 
between scheme and talent. Per 
247’s composite rankings, Ohio 
State’s roster has 13 former five-
star recruits to Michigan’s four. 
For four-stars, the gap is 47 to 36. 
None of that is insurmountable, 
but it creates an uphill battle.
A year ago, that talent gap was 
evident when Dwayne Haskins 
shredded Michigan for 396 yards 
and six touchdowns. In that game, 
though, Brown stood at the center 
of criticism for his inability to 
scheme against the Buckeyes’ 
crossing routes. This year, there 
was no single weakness that stood 
out so glaringly.
Dobbins piled on 211 rushing 
yards, quarterback Justin Fields 
passed for 301 and four scores 
and, once again, Ohio State 
did whatever it wanted to the 
Wolverines.
By the time the Buckeyes 
congregated in the south end 
zone, dancing on the maize ‘M’ 
while Michigan trudged down 
the tunnel, they had scored more 
points than they did against 
Florida 
Atlantic, 
Cincinnati, 
Indiana, 
Nebraska, 
Michigan 
State and Northwestern.
“We gotta dig down next year, 
see what we got,” Hutchinson said. 
“You’re not gonna win ballgames 
when you’re letting up 50 to 60 
points. It’s not gonna happen. So, 

we gotta be better.”
It’s an eerily similar sentiment 
to 
the 
one 
the 
Wolverines 
preached a year ago, with an 
identical silence enveloping Ohio 
Stadium’s auxiliary media room.
“We’ll come back motivated and 
make darn sure it doesn’t happen 
again,” Harbaugh said then.
To make sure he stayed true 
to his word, Harbaugh went 
out and hired a young, forward-
thinking offensive coordinator, 
relinquishing the keys to his 
offense for the first time in his 
coaching career. But on the 
defensive side, his only changes 
came when his hand was forced 
by these Buckeyes poaching two 
of his most respected assistant 
coaches.
So a year later, when a near-
carbon copy of that game unfolded 
in Ann Arbor, there were more 
questions than answers.
“I’m 
not 
going 
into 
the 
criticizing, 
and 
blaming 
and 
things like that,” Harbaugh said.
He doesn’t need to — the stat 
sheet does it for him. Ohio State’s 
composite offensive line over 
these past two versions of The 
Game: 118 points, 1,144 yards.
Minutes later, as Hutchinson 
stared at that stat sheet, all he 
could do was pause and shake his 
head in disbelief.
“It’s 
hard 
to 
look 
at,” 
Hutchinson said. “We’re just a 
better defense than this, we’re a 
better team than this.”
For the second year in a row, 
they’ll have to wait 12 months to 
prove it.

Wolverines topple No. 8 Gonzaga, 82-64, win Battle 4 Atlantis title

Nobody thought much of this 
Michigan team.
Nobody thought they would 
finish beyond the middle of the 
pack in their conference.
Nobody thought they would 
go to the Bahamas and come 
back with a trophy.
Three days and three quality 
wins later, the Wolverines are 
proving that they have a lot 
more potential than anyone was 
giving them credit for. They 
defeated No. 8 Gonzaga, 82-64, 
on Friday in the championship of 
the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament 

in the Bahamas, their second 
win over a top-10 team in as 
many days, as their defense 
stifled the Bulldogs’ imposing 
transition offense. 
“We’re here to win,” said 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard. 
“They believe in it, they trust in 
it, and it worked. At the end of 
the day, I’m just so proud of this 
group, and how they competed 
throughout the weekend.”
The Wolverines started the 
game playing from behind, as 
Gonzaga’s size and speed up 
front helped the Bulldogs out to 
a quick start, but Michigan seem 
to find its composure around 
the 13-minute mark, going on a 

10-0 run and eventually taking 
the lead as their shots started to 
fall and their defense started to 
have more success. 
From there, the game was 
closely 
matched, 
but 
the 
Wolverines were much more 
confident than they had initially, 
contesting more rebounds and 
playing more aggressively in 
their frontcourt. It was most 
notable in senior center Jon 
Teske, who was visibly fired 
up as his shots kept finding the 
net late in the first half, and 
especially after he tipped in a 
rebound of a missed three-point 
attempt from junior guard Eli 
Brooks to put Michigan up by 

eleven going into the halftime 
break. 
“As a senior now, I gotta be 
a leader,” Teske, who finished 
with 19 points, said. “I came in 
and I knew my role. Everyone 
knows their role at a certain 
point, and now there’s been a 
chance as I’ve gotten older, as 
a junior and senior, where I just 
gotta lead the younger guys, and 
just try and help the team win, 
and we’re having fun doing it.”
Sophomore 
guard 
David 
DeJulius also looked good for 
Michigan on Friday, moving 
nicely inside the paint and 
passing 
well. 
He 
has 
seen 
more minutes recently, playing 
66 minutes over the three 
tournament 
games 
in 
the 
Bahamas, and has flourished in 
the sixth-man role, leading the 

bench all season.
The Wolverines started slow 
again coming out of the break, 
not scoring until three and a 
half minutes into the second 
half, giving the Zags a chance 
to go on a 10-0 run of their 
own. Michigan did eventually 
warm back up, though, and 
seized control of the game 
around the 14-minute mark, 
taking a 12-point lead on back-
to-back threes from freshman 
guard Franz Wagner and junior 
forward 
Isaiah 
Livers 
and 
then expanding it to a 19-point 
margin around the 11-minute 
mark. From there, the game and 
the championship were never in 
question.
Michigan 
is 
as 
of 
yet 
unranked, 
something 
that 
is 
likely 
to 
change 
after 

tournament 
wins 
over 
the 
Bulldogs as well as Iowa State 
on Wednesday and No. 6 North 
Carolina 
on 
Thursday. 
The 
Wolverines head into a tough 
midweek away game against 
potential No. 1 Louisville on 
Tuesday, another chance to 
prove themselves against high-
level competition, but the top 
priority for now is staying in the 
rhythm they’ve found these last 
few games.
“We just keep grinding,” 
Livers said. “We don’t really 
pay attention to all the media 
stuff. We want to play Michigan 
basketball, and that’s all – that’s 
all – we’re going to be focused 
on. We’re not focused on any 
rankings, or any of that outside 
mess that people want to talk 
about. We play for each other.”
