Both a vigil and anti-Trump 

rally were held Wednesday night 
in 
protest 
of 
President-elect 

Donald 
Trump’s 
unexpected 

win in the Diag, drawing a 
crowd of nearly 1,000 University 
of Michigan students, faculty 
and staff, as well as community 
members.

The 
vigil 
featured 
both 

student speakers and University 
of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel. Speakers called for 
perseverance during the next four 
years of Trump’s term, discussing 
both the fear felt by minority 
students on campus and the 
importance of action.

LSA senior Nicole Khamis 

opened the vigil by recounting 
conversations with her parents, 
who are Palestinian refugees, the 
morning after Election Day.

“We came here for a better life 

and last night, I woke up at 2:30 
to the election results,” she said. 
“I thought it was a dream. And 
I called my parents, they could 
see that my eyes are red because 
I had been tearing up. … And (my 
mother) looked at me and said, 
‘This is not the end.’ ”

Throughout 
his 
campaign, 

Trump has criticized President 
Barack Obama and Democratic 
presidential 
nominee 
Hillary 

Clinton’s policy of allowing more 
Syrian refugees to enter the 
country. Trump’s immigration 
plan details an end to letting a 
number of groups into the United 
States, and in February Trump 
claimed he would look at Syrian 
children and tell them they could 
not enter the country.

“Are we going to stand up 

in the face of racism, in the 
face of sexism, in the face of 
xenophobia?” Khamis asked the 
cheering crowd. “My parents have 
escaped a war to have a better life 
for me and my two siblings. And 
we did not come to this country 
for this.”

In 
his 
remarks, 
Schlissel 

congratulated 
University 

students for waiting in lines and 
voting, stating that student voices 
were 90-10 in favor of a candidate 
other than Trump. Earlier today, 
he penned an email to students 
urging them to be inclusive and 
work toward intellectual honesty 
in their conversations.

“Ninety 
percent 
of 
you 

rejected the kind of hate and the 
fractiousness and the longing for 
some kind of idealized version of 
a non-existent yesterday that was 
expressed during the campaign,” 
Schlissel said during the event. 
“So I urge you, continue your 
advocacy and your voices are 
already being heard. They are 
loud and clear — this is the way 
America changes. It’s the way it 
always changes. It’s the way it will 
change for the better.”

According 
to 
USA 
Today 

exit polls, 56 percent of voters 
nationwide ages 18 to 24 voted 
for Clinton. There are no age-
based exit polls specifically for 
Ann Arbor, but Michigan Daily 
surveys of students in the leadup 
to the election indicated a strong 
campus preference for Clinton at 
about 70 percent.

At the rally, similar sentiments 

were expressed. Business junior 
Myles Hawkins said he felt shock 
after finding out the results of the 
election, and that he came to the 
rally to gain a sense of comfort 
about the situation.

“(As an) African American, it’s 

hard to fathom Donald Trump 
being 
my 
president 
because 

he (has) no respect for my 
background, and it’s shocking 
to have gone from the first Black 
president, which was celebrated 
in my family … to a person who 
doesn’t seem to care about (them) 
or my culture,” he said.

The 
rally 
emphasized 

solidarity and began with a chant: 
“The people united will never be 
divided,” that progressively grew 
into a unified roar.

Speakers at both the vigil 

and the rally also emphasized 
the need to take action moving 
forward. In remarks at the vigil, 
CSG President David Schafer, an

November 2016 Election
VOTER TURNOUT

Ann Arbor

Washtenaw County

President-elect 
Donald 

Trump’s victory over Democratic 
presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton 
has 
baffled 
many 

Americans expecting a Clinton 
victory in light of earlier polling 
— but some experts say voter 
demographics 
could 
explain 

Trump’s upset win.

Adding 
to 
the 
questions 

for some, it was confirmed 
Wednesday that despite losing 
the Electoral College and the 
presidency, Clinton won the 
popular vote by a small margin 
of about 0.2 percent.

Michael Traugott, a research 

professor at the University of 
Michigan’s Center for Political 
Studies, said will be much 
explanation in the coming days 
as to why the polling data was so 
wrong in their predictions.

“We 
know 
what 
the 

explanations are likely to be 
on why the polling was wrong 
… they didn’t estimate turnout 
too well,” Traugott said. “They 
might have had a problem in 
detecting support for Trump 
— some would call them shy 
Trump voters. This will require 
a very careful review of the polls, 
but clearly they misestimated.”

The exit polls released thus 

far show a sharp divide in race, 

See POLLS, Page 3A

In an extremely close race 

nationwide, for a period of 
time Election Day all eyes were 
on Michigan, but the state 
ultimately wasn’t the one to 
hand President-elect Donald 
Trump his victory. However, 
many of the trends seen in the 
state around turnout and voter 
enthusiasm are similar to those 
in the other close states that did 
hand Trump his win.

After the Associated Press 

called 
the 
race, 
declaring 

Republican 
presidential 

nominee Donald Trump the 
president-elect at 2:30 a.m., 

Michigan was still counting 
votes from several counties. It 
continues to be in a deadlock, 
with Trump leading by just 
11,837 votes, which would be a 
0.3 percent margin of victory.

If Trump wins the state, he 

will be the first Republican to 
do so since 1988. The race in 
Michigan became tighter in 
recent days as the candidates 
and their surrogates visited the 
state, but in the months leading 
up to the election Clinton 
maintained a lead over Trump 
in the state, and her campaign 
considered the state to be an 
almost guaranteed win.

However, especially toward

The Ann Arbor community 

reflected 
on 
President-elect 

Donald Trump’s upset win at 
an event “Anxious Election,” 
held Wednesday evening after 
the election was called early 
that morning.

“I, 
like 
most 
people 
on 

campus, woke up this morning 
absolutely shocked at the news,” 
attendee and Rackham student 
Sean Kramer said. “This is a 
scenario that before last night 
I’d never really imagined was 
possible.” 

The 
Natural 
Science 

Auditorium was filled nearly 
to 
capacity 
for 
the 
event, 

with many audience members 

coming from a candlelight vigil 
held in the Diag Wednesday 
evening. The forum, sponsored 
by the History Department, 
was planned several weeks 
prior to the election.

The event began with each 

panelist sharing their thoughts 
on the results and how to make 
sense of what had unfolded in 
the last 24 hours.

Associate 
History 
Prof. 

Matthew Countryman noted 
what 
he 
deemed 
a 
stark 

difference 
between 
this 

election and the outcome and 
process in 2012.

“Trump 
didn’t 
do 
better 

than Romney,” he said, adding 
that he wasn’t sure how this 
outcome 
came 
to 
be. 
He 

concluded saying that, “Clinton 
could not deliver the Obama 

Coalition.”

The forum also addressed 

the many unique factors that 
have 
shaped 
this 
election, 

from shifts in the electorate 
to support of a candidate that 
History Prof. Geoff Eley said 
could be deemed a fascist, 
to the unprecedented role of 
social media.

LSA senior Leah Duncan, 

one of the panelists, said she 
thought 
social 
media 
sites 

fueled much of the contention 
throughout 
the 
campaigns, 

adding 
that 
the 
arguments 

on these sites do not tell the 
full story and can undermine 
the political complexities of 
platforms.

“With the advent of social 

media, this has introduced I 
believe a new combat zone for 

the election,” she said. “Social 
media has really evolved from 
an afterthought to a strategic 
means of free ad space.”

During 
the 
election, 

Trump’s use of Twitter to 
target political enemies and 
connect to supporters became 
infamous. In the last few days 
before the election, The New 
York Times reported that his 
staff had taken away his direct 
control of his Twitter account

Members of the audience 

were 
given 
time 
to 
ask 

questions 
and 
share 
their 

thoughts and reflections, with 
many thoughts and questions 
touching 
on 
anxieties 
and 

worries for the coming months 
and years under a Trump 
presidency.

Audience 
members 
also 

asked about the role of racism in 
this election and if it ultimately 
decided 
the 
results. 
While 

many of the panelists said they 
thought it was decided by a 
multitude of factors, they also 
said they were particularly 
concerned 
that 
60 
million 

voters 
were 
not 
offended 

by 
Trump. 
Throughout 
his 

campaign, Trump has proposed 
to ban all Muslim immigration, 
made 
offensive 
comments 

about Mexican immigrants and 
bragged about innappropriately 
touching women.

Engineering junior Mehul 

Kulkarni said he was feeling 
scared after the results of the 
election came in.

“Well my family, we don’t 

look like everyone else,” he 
said.

Several 
panelists 
said 

many of them, as faculty and 
professors at the University, 
have been struggling with how 
to talk to their students about 
the effect of a Trump win.

Anna Berg, the assistant 

director 
of 
Undergraduate 

Studies, 
said 
professors 

cannot avoid talking about 
the 
consequences 
of 
how 

Americans voted.

“(It’s) important that we do 

away with the false sense of 
neutrality,” she said. “That we 
make it clear to our students 
and to everyone else and to 
ourselves, too, that certain 
kinds of things cannot be said.”

COLIN BERESFORD

For the Daily

Wednesday morning, University 

of Michigan students woke up 

to find the Rock — a University 

landmark located at the intersection 

of Hill Street and Washtenaw 

Avenue frequently painted by 

students — depicting violent slogans. 
 

The rock, which had featured an 

Election Day message from Hillary 

Clinton supporters who drew the 

Clinton campaign logo, was painted 

over to read “fuck America” and “kill 

em all.” Also painted on the rock 

were the Democratic Party donkey 

and Republican Party elephant 

logos.

 The rock was later panted over 

by students with positive messages. 

As of Wednesday evening, it was 

unknown who is responsible for the 

messages, but many students said 

they believed they were a reaction 

to Tuesday’s election results. Both 

Democratic presidential nominee 

Hillary Clinton and President-elect 

Donald Trump are two of the most 

unpopular candidates in history, and 

Trump has faced heavy criticism for 

rhetoric about Muslims, immigrants, 

women and other minority groups.

“I feel like if this is such a pivotal 

moment for our country we should 

be coming together as a community 

rather than tearing each other down 

like this,” LSA sophomore Makenzi 

Cochran said.

Later Wednesday afternoon, 

The Office of Public Affairs tweeted 

out pictures of students painting 

over the rock with messages of 

support.

Campus outcry following the 

announcement of the election 

results began early Wednesday 

morning, when, at around 3 a.m. 

students gathered on the Diag for 

a vigil.

“I’m not even holding back tears 

anymore it’s more I’m just numb,” 

Kinesiology senior Lauren McCree 

said. “It just really exposes our 

University and that the people who 

go here think that this is OK.”

In response to Trump’s victory, 

student groups have scheduled vigils 

on the Diag to protest and come 

together throughout the week.

Earlier Wednesday, University 

President Mark Schlissel sent an 

email to the student body about 

the election results, calling for 

inclusivity. He also listed various 

University services dedicated to 

mental health and wellness.

“Our responsibility is to remain 

committed to education, discovery 

and intellectual honesty – and to 

diversity, equity and inclusion,” 

Schlissel wrote. “We are at our best 

when we come together to engage 

respectfully across our ideological 

differences; to support ALL who 

feel marginalized, threatened 

or unwelcome; and to pursue 

knowledge and understanding, as 

we always have, as the students, 

faculty and staff of the University of 

Michigan.”

BRIEF: THE ROCK IS GRAFFITIED WITH “FUCK AMERICA” AND “KILL EM ALL” AFTER ELECTION

GRANT HARDY/Daily

The Rock, still smelling of fresh paint, had the phrase “FUCK AMERICA” written on it Wednesday, one day after 
Election Day.

After Donald Trump’s unexpected 
win, campus is somber and reflective

On the first day after the 2016 

election, in which President-elect 
Donald Trump won an upset 
victory, campus was strangely 
quiet — no voices calling out on 
the Diag encouraging students 
to vote, no one campaigning 
on behalf of their candidates. 
Messages of encouragement and 
inclusivity were chalked on the 
Diag, but besides that, campus 
largely seemed silent and somber.

LSA senior Lauren Gallagher, 

president of the University’s 
chapter of Students for Hillary, 
said she noticed a darker mood on 
the Democratic-leaning campus 
today after Trump’s victory, but 
noted she also saw students and 
administrators reach out with 

comforting words to one another.

“Today, the climate on campus 

was somber; students were not 
only thinking about themselves, 
but also their family, friends and 
fellow students who may be in 
marginalized groups,” Gallagher 
said. “But within this climate, I 
saw students coming together 
supporting one another and 
the University administration 
stepping up and saying ‘we are 
here for you.’ ”

Washtenaw 
County 
voted 

overwhelmingly for Clinton by a 
margin of 71.1 percent to Trump’s 
26.5 percent yesterday though 
Trump leads statewide by 1,1837 
votes and claimed the presidency 
by at least 279 electoral votes.

But, students still made their 

support 
for 
Clinton 
known 

Wednesday, taking to the Diag in 

attempts to spread more hopeful 
messages. Music, Theatre & 
Dance 
sophomore 
Alexandra 

Deamant, who voted for Clinton, 
sat holding a “Love Trumps Hate” 
flier Wednesday afternoon.

“(I felt) shock and anger and 

frustration and all of the bad 
emotions,” Deamant said. “I am 
outwardly reflecting love and 
hope, even though I am so lost 
and confused right now.”

Later that day a vigil was held 

on campus in response to the 
election of Trump as president.

However, not all students 

were 
unhappy 
with 
the 

election outcome. LSA junior 
Enrique 
Zalamea, 
president 

of the University’s chapter of 
College Republicans, said he felt 
disappointed and saddened by the 
responses to Trump’s victory. He 
emphasized his wish for humility 
and unity, saying he witnessed 
signs at the “Uniting Michigan” 
student vigil on the Diag that he 
believed were contrary to the 
event’s message and goal.

“As a first-generation American 

who truly loves this country and 
what it stands for, I am incredibly 
saddened to see the response 
of this campus to such a great 
victory for the American people,” 
Zalamea said. “Some students 
at the vigil tonight were talking 
about how ashamed they are 
being an American; one student 
had an American flag with the 
words ‘Abolish America’ written 
on it … now is the time for unity, 
for humility and for prayer.”

Engineering sophomore Jack 

Kuchta, who voted for Trump, 
also said he was alarmed by the 
campus environment today and 
felt that some peers who knew he 
was voting for Trump treated him 
with more hostility.

“When talking with some 

of my friends, they seemed 
mad at me, which is extremely

More than 200 people, many 

sitting on the floor to fit into the 
space, assembled Wednesday at the 
Ford School of Public Policy to listen 
to a panel of five professors and 
politicians analyze the results of 
the election and give projections on 
how future policy will be affected 
by President-elect Donald Trump.

The 
panel 
also 
answered 

audience questions on the social 
implications of Trump’s rhetoric 
and reasons for the election’s 
outcome.

Ron 
Weiser, 
former 
U.S. 

Ambassador and newly elected 
member of the University of 
Michigan’s 
Board 
of 
Regents, 

began his speech by saying he was 
just as shocked by Trump’s victory 
as everyone else. As a Republican 
on campus, he said he felt he was 
viewed in a different light by 
students.

“Yes, I’m a Republican, and 

yes, quite often on campus I feel 
unwelcome,” Weiser said. “I was 
surprised with the outcome, as most 
of the people in this room were.”

According to a Michigan Daily 

poll, 19 percent of students identify 
as Republican.

Speaking to the months to 

come, Weiser said he thinks there 
are positive outcomes of a Trump 
presidency. He added that he has 
seen a lot of political campaigns, 
and candidates say things that they 
don’t usually follow through on.

Following his remarks, multiple 

students 
directed 
questions 

toward Weiser regarding Trump’s 
controversial rhetoric throughout 
his campaign. Weiser said he had 
been accused of “Trumpism” in 
the past, adding that he finds those 
views despicable. Clarifying his 
views, Weiser said he supports 
Trump’s economic policies but does 
not agree with all of his rhetoric.

“We all make choices, and I’m 

an economic conservative and I 
think that some of the things that 
I believe in are fundamental, and 

I don’t believe that they’re being 
promoted in order to take advantage 
of the disadvantaged,” Weiser said. 
“I spent most of my life trying to 
help the disadvantaged, not take 
advantage of them.”

Former U.S. Rep. John Dingell, 

a panelist, said he was optimistic 
that the country will come together 
and work for the greater good of 
the people. He said the United 
States is still the greatest nation 
in the world and systems like the 
peaceful transfer of power between 
the president and his successor are 
what make it so prosperous.

“I am hopeful that we will find 

that those will not be thrown out 
the window, although Trump has 
said that he will do away with most 
of those things,” Dingell said.

The rest of the panel was not as 

optimistic, with all three female 
panelists noting citizen frustration 
as a driving force of Trump’s 
campaign and election win.

Political Science Prof. Mara 

Ostfeld, who was part of a research 
team that analyzed exit polls 

Tuesday, discussed three trends of 
the election: female voters, white 
male voters and Latino/African-
American voters. She said 40 
percent of white voters, according 
to the polls, felt that minorities 
are more privileged than white 
Americans, marked by a trend of 
white men shifting away from the 
Democratic Party.

Ostfeld said she believed that the 

race angle of these results is notable 
in analyzing the social identities and 
types of meaning that the parties 
are conjuring.

“It is important to contextualize 

in the Trump campaign that when it 
started immigration policy was the 
only policy on his website,” she said.

Ostfeld noted Florida, which 

went to Trump, was also a surprise 
in the polls, as analysts thought 
Democrats had a strong hold over 
the state due to its Latino voters. She 
added that, though Cubans moved 
away from the Republican Party in 
previous elections, this year was a 
dramatic shift back.

Public 
Policy 
Prof. 
Betsey 

Stevenson, shifting from discussing 
poll results to policies, noted 
stagnant wages as the motivation 
behind citizens looking for a 
difference in voting for Trump. 
However, she said she was not 
prepared to speak on Trump’s 
platform, as she was expecting a 
Clinton win and thought his policy 
plans were weak.

“I can tell you it’s not for lack 

of studying that I don’t know the 
Trump policy platform very well,” 
she said.

Stevenson added that because 

Obama focused on mostly partisan 
Democratic policy, there is a lot that 
can be undone by Trump. However, 
she said she thinks Trump is a big 
talker and likes to tell stories to the 
American people, but questioned 
whether he would follow through.

Building 
on 
Stevenson’s 

comments, Public Policy Prof. 
Marina 
Whitman 
discussed 

international 
trade 
policy 
and 

said there is a lot of asymmetry in 
a president’s power with respect 
to trade issues. As a result, she 

said Trump could tear up trade 
agreements with little concession 
from 
the 
other 
branches 
of 

government. 
He 
has 
openly 

criticized NAFTA throughout his 
campaign. 
However, 
Whitman 

noted that she did not believe 
he could totally alter all trade 
agreements.

“Will he tear up NAFTA? I don’t 

think that omelets can be converted 
back into eggs,” Whitman said. 

Rackham 
student 
Harry 

Wolberg, an attendee, said he was 
disappointed by the results of the 
election and thought that the results 
did not follow a logical process.

“I liked that it was a diverse 

panel,” he said. “I want to hear 
people talk more about policies 
that are going to be involved in the 
next administration. So there were 
a lot of questions devoted to that 
and it’s hard to tell what’s going to 
happen in the future, but I want to 
see how both sides respond to using 
evidence-based research for foreign 
policy.”

gender and educational status 
— among other deviations — for 
voters in the 2016 presidential 
election.

While there is still much 

analysis to be completed in the 
coming days, so far it appears that 
middle-class, white America was 
the tipping point demographic in 
winning Trump the election.

Exit polls illustrate that women 

overwhelmingly 
supported 

Clinton overall, as did voters under 
the age of 45. Other than gender 
and age, race proved to be a strong 
indicator 
of 
which 
candidate 

demographic 
groups 
would 

support. As predicted by pollsters 
in previous samplings, 58 percent 
of white voters overall supported 
Trump while 74 percent of non-
white voters voted for Clinton.

Delving 
deeper 
into 
each 

demographic, race consistently 
emerged as a point of divide. Each 
age bracket of white voters had 
a majority that voted for Trump, 
while all age brackets of minority 
groups overwhelmingly supported 
Clinton. 
Additionally, 
white 

woman voted for Trump in much 
higher numbers than women of 
color.

For Josh Pasek, a professor 

of communication studies, one 
possible explanation of the failure 
of the polls stems from which 
voters were included.

“I’m 
guessing 
that 
what 

happened here is that a lot of the 
models that worked in the past … 
ended up undercutting the actual 
enthusiasm among Trump voters,” 
Pasek said. “That is largely because 
Trump voters aren’t traditional, 
regular, habitual voters. They were 
energized this time. And a lot of 

that is because the voter models 
under-predicted 
whether 
they 

turned out or not.”

Other than failure of the voter 

models, Traugott said there is also 
national pattern of rising rural 
support for Trump that likely 
wasn’t captured.

“The analysis of the exit polls 

show not only about who people 
voted for but why the selected the 
candidates that they did,” Traugott 
said. “It’s clear that Trump was the 
anti-establishment candidate. He 
campaigned against Washington. 
In hindsight, that turned out to be 
a powerful message.”

Educational 
attainment 
also 

proved to be a key indicator among 
voters in this election. Across 
almost every demographic, the 
majority of college graduates or 
postgraduates voted for Clinton, 
except for white college graduates 
who supported Trump by 4 percent 
over Clinton.

Turnout data is still being 

collected, but the data thus far 
suggests that 2016 voter turnout 
was up 4.7 percent around the 
country from the 2012 election, a 
trend that included Ann Arbor and 
the surrounding counties.

However, Pasek said despite 

the rise in voter turnout, it wasn’t 
enough for the Clinton campaign.

“If you look at the areas that 

have reported their full turnout 
numbers, it’s clear that the highest 
turnout was not in the city of 
Ann Arbor itself, it was in the 
surrounding areas,” Pasek said. 
“That is very telling. The kinds of 
turnout rates we were seeing were 
not the kinds of rates the Clinton 
campaign was hoping for if they 
wanted to have a clean win in the 
state.”

On 
campus, 
the 
average 

millennial voter both did and 
didn’t match up to national exit poll 
averages according to Michigan 

Daily survey data.

Similar 
to 
what 
the 
exit 

polls show, student voters at 
the University overwhelmingly 
supported 
Clinton 
— 
in 
the 

most recent poll, 76 percent of 
respondents said they planned 
on voting for her. University 
respondents differed from the 
national norm, however, in that 
more whites and males on campus 
showed 
support 
for 
Clinton 

rather than Trump, though it is 
worth noting that exit polls have 
suggested individuals nationwide 
concealed their vote for Trump in 
pre-election surveys.

In terms of partisanship, the 

election was broadly similar to past 
ones — young people, as well as 
minorities and women, continued 
to support Democrats while older 
generations and more white males 
continued to vote Republican.

Traugott said mobilizing every 

voter base was key in this election.

“Young people have a tendency 

to 
support 
the 
Democratic 

candidate over the Republican 
candidate, and it looks like the 
margin of victory is going to be 
very small,” Traugott said. “This is 
an example of how every little bit 
helps.”

Pasek said while this election 

continued to show an ideological 
divide based on age, the past few 
cycles are suggesting that electoral 
divisions are shifting more toward 
geographical differences.

“When 
you’re 
older, 
you 

accumulate more wealth, so the 
tendency is for people to become 
more conservative because they 
don’t want to see their wealth 
redistributed,” Pasek said. “But 
I think we are moving away 
from that, we are seeing larger 
demographic differences that are 
less about age and more about 
other things.”

POLLS

the end of the campaign, Trump 
challenged 
those 
assumptions, 

claiming in his final campaign rally 
in Grand Rapids Monday that he 
would win the state, propelling his 
victory in the election as a whole.

“If we win Michigan, we will 

win this historic election and then 
we truly will be able to do all of the 
things we want to do,” he said at the 
time.

While the state did not ultimately 

secure Trump’s victory, the rapid 
changes in the state over the last few 
days before the election mirrored 
those in the states that did, such as 
Wisconsin.

Communications Studies Prof. 

Josh Pasek, an expert in public 
opinion and polling, said the race 
both in Michigan and across the 
country came down to a matter 
of turnout. The counties Clinton 
won, he said, had a lower turnout in 
groups that tend to favor her — such 
as minorities and young people — 
than she needed to win.

“The big notes have been that 

more white voters — in particular 
blue collar and rural — have voted 
in this election than in the past,” 
he said. “We did see that if Hillary 
Clinton wanted to win Michigan, 
she needed to turnout slightly 
better numbers than she did in the 
cities of Ann Arbor and Detroit than 

she did,” she said. “She didn’t do 
that, and it stops there.”

In Washtenaw County, which 

houses the University of Michigan, 
voter turnout was 65.6 percent. 
However, in the four precincts that 
feature many student voters, with 
polling locations in the Michigan 
Union and Michigan League, voter 

turnout ranged from 42.8 percent to 
49.71 percent.

Overall, 
voter 
turnout 
was 

noticeably higher in the more 
rural areas outside of Ann Arbor, 
according to a Washtenaw County 
map. Most voters in precincts in 
and near Ann Arbor voted for 
Clinton, while the areas farther 
from campus in the county cast 
more votes for Trump.

While the majority of students 

supported 
Clinton 
throughout 

the election season, according 
Michigan Daily election surveys, 
students 
didn’t 
appear 
very 

enthused about either Clinton 
or Trump while waiting in long 

polling lines at some locations 
on campus. Compared to 2012, 
when the youth, Black and Latino 
voters enthusiastically re-elected 
President Obama, this year seemed 
different.

Pasek said it is possible that if all 

students at the University had voted 
in the election, Clinton could have 
secured enough votes to win the 
state.

“There probably were enough 

non-voting 
students 
at 
the 

University of Michigan to be darn 
close in making up the difference 
between Trump and Clinton,” he 
said. “I think there is a case to be 
made that if you had gotten perfect 
University of Michigan turnout, 
Michigan would have had a much 
better chance of going Democrat.”

Democrats 
attempted 
to 

encourage the student vote on 
campus through Get Out the Vote 
efforts by campus organizations 
such as the University’s chapters 
of College Democrats and Students 
for Hillary, and campus visits 
from surrogates such as Sen. Tim 
Kaine (D-VA), Democratic vice 
presidential nominee, Sen. Bernie 
Sanders 
(I–Vt.) 
and 
President 

Barack Obama, who drew a crowd 
of 9,000 the day before the election.

However, Pasek said these efforts 

were not enough to overcome the 
traditionally low turnout numbers 
among young people.

“An 
enthusiasm 
difference 

makes a big difference,” he said. 

“The more people are hearing 
from surrogates they want to hear 
from, the more they want to turn 
out, and that is clearly the case for 
students, but we did see that Hillary 
Clinton still needed better turnout 
numbers.”

In 
her 
concession 
speech, 

Clinton appealed to young people, 
asking them to not give up hope 
because of her loss.

“To all of us, and to the young 

people in particular, I hope you 
will hear this. I have, as Tim said, 
I have spent my entire life fighting 
for what I believe in,” she said. 
“I’ve had successes and setbacks 
and sometimes painful ones. Many 
of you are at the beginning of your 
professional, public, and political 
careers — you will have successes 
and setbacks too. This loss hurts, 
but please never stop believing that 
fighting for what’s right is worth it.”

Pasek 
noted, 
however, 
that 

Clinton’s loss may deter voters 
from participating in the electoral 
process future.

“I think losing does diminish 

future 
participation,” 
he 
said. 

“When people first vote in an 
election and they win and feel like 
they made a difference, that is much 
more empowering than being on the 
losing side. It probably will for most 
college students mean that they will 
vote less often in the future.”

Beyond student concentration, 

turnout among other demographics 
in counties statewide also had a 

large impact on the state’s overall 
vote, similar to other late-emerging 
battlegrounds.

Wayne County, which houses 

Detroit, had an even lower voter 
turnout rate than Washtenaw at 
58.8 percent. In the city of Detroit 
turnout reflected that of Ann Arbor 
at 48.5 percent.

In 
contrast, 
Trump 
saw 

unexpectedly 
high 
turnout 

numbers nationwide, including in 
many Michigan communities, from 
his core demographic: working 
class white men.

LSA junior Nick Kolenda, the 

president of a Students for Sanders 
group active on campus during 
the Democratic primary, wrote 
in an email interview that he felt 
the Democrat Party’s shift toward 

the center on trade affected the 
outcome.

“Trump will likely have won 

due to high rural and white-
working class support which has 
become reactionary over the past 

decades,” he wrote. “Clinton and 
the center Democratic party’s 
neoliberalism/trade policy caused 
Clinton to underperform in the 
upper Midwest. The white working 
class, having been frightened off of 
socialism and unions, believed that 
a strongman could make their lives 
better.”

Throughout 
her 
time 

campaigning, Clinton and her 
surrogates made appeals to white 
working class voters through visits 
and speeches with union workers, 
but it was Trump’s message of 
change that swung their vote. 
According to the CNN exit poll in 
Michigan, 39 percent of voters said 
a candidate’s ability to bring change 
is the most important quality, with 
the number rising to 83 percent 
among Trump supporters.

Pasek said the white working 

class vote has been shifting to 
the right for several years now as 
globalization impacts that group 
more than any other.

“We’ve seen increasingly over 

the last few cycles additional 
challenges for the Democrats in 
holding union members,” he said. 
“Blue collar industries in general 
are areas that are getting hit 
more with globalization. On some 
level, the election ends up being 
a referendum on globalization in 
general and whether we should 
be having trade deals or be more 
isolationist.”

LSA senior, asked all individuals 
in the crowd to hold others 
accountable for discriminatory 
actions. 
He 
said 
minority 

students have had to be the 
ones responsible for calling out 
hate speech in the past, citing 
an incident last semester when 
Muslim students were the ones 
to wash off anti-Islamophobic 
chalk drawings on the Diag.

“To 
all 
that 
have 
been 

targeted or marginalized: You 
have a place on this campus,” 
he said. “The University of 
Michigan is yours just as much 
as anybody else’s. Don’t stop 
challenging each other. So I 
am challenging everyone here 
tonight who professes to be 
an ally — whenever you hear a 
microaggression, whenever you 
hear an act of discrimination and 
bigotry or injustice perpetrated 
by one of your friends or anyone 
of your acquaintances, step up 
and challenge them. Because 
if you don’t, you are part of the 
problem.”

LSA senior Tina Al-khersan 

told the crowd at the vigil 
several stories about her younger 
brother being asked if he had 
bombs underneath his coat in 
a response to Trump’s anti-
Muslim rhetoric, which has 
included 
statements 
about 

deporting Muslims due to their 
possibly being terrorists. 

Speaking before Al-khersan, 

University alum Harleen Kaur 
said she felt afraid for her life 
the day after Trump’s win.

“I simply ask for you to not 

be comfortable as we have after 
violence and tragedy countless 
times before,” Kaur said. “Do 

not let yourself be destroyed by 
fear but do not let yourself be 
wooed into calm. There’s work 
to be done.”

Multiple speakers at both the 

vigil and rally told the crowd 
they had the right to feel sadness 
about 
the 
election 
result, 

calling it a confirmation that 
the country does not support 
minorities.

At the vigil, Khamis said 

her family has not traveled to 
the United States only to be 
deported.

“We need to organize, we 

need to mobilize,” she said. 
“Remember this is not a new 
fight for my family, this is not a 
new fight for women, this is not 
a new fight for Latina/Latino, 
this is not a new fight for the 
LGBT+ community. This has 
been happening forever. But 
now we know that it has been 
institutionalized to the point it 
is in the White House.”

Earlier in the night at the 

rally, Public Policy graduate 
student 
Sundar 
Sharma 

expressed similar sentiments.

“(We must) grieve and rebuild 

… especially because of the 
forces trying to stop us,” Sharma 
said. “Trump and Trumpism 
isn’t going to be around forever.”

LSA 
senior 
Adedolapo 

Adeniji, whose parents are both 
immigrants to the United States, 
told the vigil crowd she was not 
going to stop fighting — and 
asked fellow students to do the 
same.

“I don’t care what the election 

said today,” she said. “I don’t 
care what it says in the next four 
years.

alarming seeing as they had 
all been perfectly fine with 
me 
supporting 
him 
before 

and during the election while 
Hillary Clinton was still in the 
race,” Kuchta said.

University 
administrators, 

including 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
and 
LSA 
Dean 

Andrew Martin, sent out emails 
Wednesday calling for unity, 
diversity 
and 
inclusiveness 

within 
the 
University 

community in the wake of the 
results.

“Our responsibility is to 

remain committed to education, 
discovery 
and 
intellectual 

honesty — and to diversity, 
equity and inclusion,” Schlissel 
wrote. “We are at our best 
when we come together to 
engage 
respectfully 
across 

our 
ideological 
differences; 

to 
support 
ALL 
who 
feel 

marginalized, 
threatened 
or 

unwelcome; 
and 
to 
pursue 

knowledge and understanding, 
as we always have, as the 
students, faculty and staff of the 
University of Michigan.”

LSA junior James Margard, 

a Clinton supporter, said he was 
disappointed with the outcome 
but wanted to see how and 
whether Trump will work to 
unify not only the country, but 
also the Republican Party.

“I’m disappointed in the 

result, but I will be interested to 
see how Trump works with the 
rest of the Republican Party, and 
to see how each party changes 
over the course of the next 
two years, especially fractures 
within the Republican Party,” 
Margard said.

FROM THE DAILY

It’s time to engage

Y

esterday, many students woke up and didn’t know what to do. Over the 
past eight years, most millennials have lived and breathed an Obama 
administration, an administration that captured many of their goals 

and inspired tremendous hope for the future. And for many students who 
grew up under this administration, this upset of an election feels apocalyptic, 
as if our world has been turned upside down. Many of us have dedicated our 
summers, our part-time jobs and our extracurricular pursuits to fighting for 
social justice issues that President-elect Donald Trump does not support. 
To people of color, to Muslims, to immigrants, to those whose livelihoods, 
families and physical bodies are threatened by Trump’s calls to action: We 
recognize your pain. It is legitimate. What this election has shown us is that 
the people of this country have a lot of work to do to bridge the gaps between 
one another. But those individuals who are most extremely marginalized by 
our president-elect should not have to do all the work themselves. Allies must 
stand in solidarity and work just as hard, if not twice as hard, for the rights of 
all who would like to call this country home.

About 90 percent of students 

at the University of Michigan 
voted for a candidate other 
than Trump, and many are 
struggling to cope with how 
to live in a world where our 
government doesn’t represent 
their 
fundamental 
values. 

Many students feel torn in half 
between the way they identify as 
liberals on campus and the way 
their parents, friends at home 
and community they grew up in 
identify. One way to deal with 
this kind of situation is to avoid 
talking about politics, because 
it’s too divisive. But that’s 
exactly the mentality that got us 
into this mess of a presidential 
election. The more constructive 
thing to do is to engage in 
conversation with family and 
with peers whose views stand in 
opposition to one’s own.

The fact that nearly half of 

our country’s voters supported 
Trump serves as evidence that 
we must also recognize and give 
that population of students — 
whether they voted for Trump 
out of support for his stances or 
in mere opposition to Clinton 
— space to vocalize their ideas. 
We must listen to them and 
understand where they are 
coming from. Their concerns, 
though expressed in political 

stances many of us do not believe 
in, have merit. We must create 
a space on campus for these 
concerns to be vocalized and 
discussed in a productive way. 
By shutting these beliefs down 
as uninformed, uneducated or 
illegitimate, we are only slowing 
down progress we can make as 
a country united. The country 
must have the introspection 
and the humility to face these 
ideals about which many of us 
so fundamentally disagree.

In turn, those who voted for 

Trump must recognize that 
the way the Trump campaign 
went about vocalizing these 
concerns was, and still is, 
tremendously 
harmful. 
We 

ask these voters to please 
realize how nativism, racism, 
protectionism, 
sexism, 
etc., 

pose 
a 
threat 
to 
people’s 

livelihoods here on U.S. soil. 
Liberals 
and 
conservatives 

must 
work 
to 
extend 

themselves 
beyond 
their 

views into the perspective of 
someone else’s. Only when 
both sides feel they can speak 
openly about their deepest 
concerns can we engage in 
productive conversation.

That 
being 
said, 
we 

recognize that these kinds 
of 
conversations 
can 
be 

extremely emotionally taxing, 
if not impossible for those 
who are most threatened by a 
Trump presidency. We all need 
to keep fighting for equality, 
but 
marginalized 
groups 

absolutely should not have to 
do it alone. This is why people 
in privileged groups, people 
who are able to separate — 
at least to some degree — 
these political issues from 
personal 
struggles, 
people 

whose families or physical 
bodies are not as directly 
threatened 
by 
Trump’s 

presidency, 
need 
to 
stand 

up for those on the farthest 
margins 
of 
this 
country. 

We must be able to engage 
with one another on these 
issues that are so important 
to every single person in 
this country, no matter their 
background, sexual identity, 
gender identity, religion, race, 
ethnicity, socioeconomic or 
citizenship status. We need 
to 
work 
toward 
equality 

selflessly. We need to work 
toward equality together.

The 
University 
has 
many 

resources for those struggling to 
cope, including Counseling and 
Psychological Services and the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center.

“How did this happen?”

I found myself repeating 

this question over and over in 
the course of election night, 
sometimes 
with 
a 
spacey, 

stoic expression on my face 
and sometimes through tears. 
The answers from my equally 
devastated friends were always 
somewhere along the lines of 
blaming voter turnout or third-
party voting.

But while the Nate Silvers of 

the world may be able to explain 
how this outcome happened, 
they cannot explain why. So let 
me take a stab at it.

Some background: I’m a strong 

Democrat — like, a bleeding-
heart liberal to my core — which 
is a rarity where I come from. 
My community is exactly the 
kind of working-class, industrial 
city that would (and did) vote 
overwhelmingly 
for 
Donald 

Trump. Going from there to 
a university that is primarily 
middle class and higher has 
been a bizarre journey. Throw 
a tendency to lean politically 
left into the mix, and you have 
a recipe for a phenomenon I like 
to refer to as liberal elitism.

You know these liberals. 

You may just be one. They read 
The New Yorker religiously, 
share articles from The Atlantic 
on Facebook and are the first 

to 
initiate 
educated 
policy 

conversations over espresso. They 
insist they aren’t the problem — 
those bigots in the lower classes 
are. They don’t say it openly, 
but these classist tendencies are 
implied often enough to infer. 
By walling themselves off from 
the realities of the world around 
them, they create a perfect bubble 
of like-mindedness. Everything is 
great, and everybody composts.

This lifestyle, naturally, does 

not entice white working-class 
people to vote Democratic — or 
any 
non-white, 
non-wealthy 

person, for that matter. If 
anything, it alienates them from 
the party, which in recent years 
has been made to seem like 
an exclusive club for college-
educated elites who watch “Last 
Week Tonight with John Oliver” 
and recap “Saturday Night Live” 
over brunch.

Meanwhile, Republicans have 

captured the white working-
class vote on social issues like 
abortion and religious freedom 
for decades, but have done very 

little to alleviate their very real 
economic struggles.

So why do white working-

class people continue to vote 
red? Because Republicans don’t 
make them feel like worthless 
outsiders; Democrats — at least 
to some extent — do.

For the record, this isn’t an 

attack on my party. I’m proud 
of our resilience in the face of 
this mess, and I know we will 
continue to press on. As a party 
of progress, we are always 
looking for ways to improve 
ourselves before we improve 
the world. I admire that most 
in us (and I’m an unabashed fan 
of espresso, The New Yorker, 
The 
Atlantic, 
John 
Oliver, 

“SNL,” brunch and composting 
as well).

This is more of a call to 

action. 
If 
we’re 
going 
to

The end of liberal smugness

An open letter to Sec. Hillary Clinton

TARA WARD | OP-ED

Dear Secretary Clinton,

Like so many, I spent last 

night in shock. Shock combined 
with episodes of anger, fear and 
the kind of bitter disappointment 
that is lodged in the stomach 
rather 
than 
the 
head. 
You 

see, yesterday afternoon was 
pretty great. I taught a lively 
class on feminist art to a group 
of 
intelligent, 
engaged 
and 

caring young women and one 
straight, white “bro” who is truly 
interested in learning about 
women’s issues. Then I brought 
my 1-year-old son with me as I 
cast my ballot for you and spent 
some 
time 
imagining 
what 

would happen to that huge glass 
ceiling at the Javits Center.

Earlier in the day someone 

had commented that I was 
smiling uncontrollably. And I 
was, because I believed that in 
a few hours I would get to enjoy 
your victory as my own, our own. 
Instead, in the darkness, I found 
myself uttering: “Why?” “How?” 
“Who?” “Really?”

Now that the sun has come 

up again, my son has smiled at 
me and called me “mama” and 
I’ve been reminded by messages 
from friends that I am not alone, 
I feel the need to say thank you. 
Secretary Clinton, you are a 
historically exceptional person. 
We must acknowledge, of course, 
your decades of accomplishments 
and the real effect they have had 
on people’s lives. However, today 
I think we need to acknowledge 
that you have patiently, doggedly 
and 
indefatigably 
overcome 

every obstacle that was placed 
in the way of a woman becoming 

president. And there were some 
absurd ones (what to wear, how 
not to be more successful than 
your husband). How did you not 
give up? Why didn’t you erupt 
into fits of cursing and tears, at 
least not in public?

The only possible answer to 

these questions is that you were 
doing it for us, that expansive 
sisterhood of people who believe 
that 
gender 
should 
not 
be 

disqualifying. Please know that 
we are grateful. You checked 
every 
box, 
did 
the 
nearly 

impossible and made us believe. 
Thank you.

I 
should 
have 
known 
it 

wouldn’t 
be 
enough. 
After 

all, I lecture on the ways 
contemporary patriarchy has 
convinced women (and every 
other underrepresented group) 
that it is their fault if they don’t 
succeed. I watch as remarkable 
undergraduates realize that they 
have been taught that they must 
be perfect in order to deserve 
love, respect and opportunity. 
And I see how many of them 
fill with righteous anger and 
how some find communities of 
support and acceptance. Yet, if I 
am honest with myself, I haven’t 
truly learned that lesson. I hear 
that loop of self-doubt and self-
blame in my head: “You’re not 
good enough, not smart enough. 
You need to work harder, be 
more prepared, be nicer. It’s 
your fault.”

But that’s not true. It’s not 

true for me, it’s not true for my 
students and I know that more 
deeply today than I did yesterday 
because, quite simply, it cannot 
be true of you. The disparity 
in qualifications and sustained 
commitment between you and 
your opponent is so obvious that 

to claim a link between those 
things and the outcome of this 
election is patently ridiculous. 
Except, they are related because 
this country expects women to 
accomplish incredible things just 
to be considered viable options 
while men (straight, white, cis-, 
rich, non-disabled men) are seen 
as naturally qualified.

There 
are 
other 
reasons 

Trump won last night and they 
deserve 
careful, 
clear-eyed 

study. Today, my eyes are blurred 
with tears so I will just say: I’m 
done. I’m done trying to live 
up to an ever-widening double 
standard. I’m done pretending 
that there is some point where 
good ideas and work magically 
overcome bias. I’m done politely 
ignoring male privilege and 
silently denying parts of myself. 
I’m done pretending these are 
individual problems and done 
trying to find solutions by 
myself. I’m done because you 
have done more of that than I 
could possibly imagine.

Mrs. Clinton, you’ve done 

enough. I mean that sincerely. 
While 
I 
look 
forward 
to 

your 
future 
insights 
and 

accomplishments, you deserve a 
rest. There are others of us who 
can and will carry the load for a 
while. And that’s in part because 
you have made it lighter. You 
have done the impossible so that 
I can refuse to jump through 
those extra hoops. I will say no 
so others won’t even be asked.

Sincerely,
Tara Ward

Wolverines could return to 
NCAA Tournament in 2016
I

n each of the last three 
seasons, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team 

made the Women’s National 
Invitational Tournament. All 
three times, the Wolverines 
advanced 
to the 
semifinals 
of that 
tournament. 
But this year, 
Michigan’s 
goal has 
little to do 
with the 
WNIT.

Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico and her 
team both stated throughout 
the preseason that this season 
would be a success only if the 
Wolverines finish in the top four 
of the Big Ten and qualify for a 
bid in the NCAA Tournament.

As it was, Michigan came 

very close to making the NCAA 
Tournament last year. A 64-63 
loss at Eastern Michigan, a 65-63 
home defeat against Purdue, an 
overtime road loss to Indiana 
and narrow home losses against 
then-No. 8 Maryland and then-
No. 7 Ohio State likely played a 
significant role in the Wolverines 
being relegated to the WNIT.

It also didn’t help that 

Michigan lost to Iowa in the 
first round of the 2016 Big Ten 
Tournament. The Wolverines 
also dropped their first 
conference tournament game in 
2015.

But with the amount of 

offensive talent Michigan 
returns for 2016-17, something 
that was not the case in 
previous years, it’s not 
unreasonable to think that 
enough of those close losses 
from last season will turn into 
wins to propel the Wolverines 
to their goals.

“I think last year, we may 

have stumbled in one or two 
(games) down the stretch,” 
Barnes Arico said. “I think 
that may have come from our 
inexperience. But this year, I 
think our experience and our 
growth in a lot of areas is going 
to shine through.”

Undoubtedly, Michigan’s 

biggest returning star is junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty. She 
once again led the Wolverines 
with 17 points in their 93-41 
victory over Wayne State on 
Thursday night. Her most 
impressive feat so far this season, 
though, may have been the fact 
that she bested Duncan Robinson 
of the men’s basketball team in a 
3-point contest. 

Her improved shooting could 

be the difference in a high-
scoring game, which is likely 
against Ohio State.

“(Flaherty) has worked 

extremely hard on her game,” 
Barnes Arico said. “She was a 
great scorer for us last year, but 
she really put in a lot of time over 
the summer and in the offseason 
to take the steps to become an 
even better player.”

But two other veterans also 

stood out Thursday.

Junior forward Jillian 

Dunston rebounded 12 times 
against the Warriors — four on 
offense and eight on defense — 
while sophomore guard Nicole 
Munger tallied 11 points and 
three consecutive 3-pointers 
despite playing just six minutes 
during the first half.

“(Dunston and Munger) are 

both spark plugs for us,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Their effort is at 
another level.”

Another key piece returning 

for the Wolverines is sophomore 
center Hallie Thome. She 
averaged 14.4 points and 5.4 
rebounds in 2015-16, which 

earned her a place on the Big 
Ten All-Freshman team. Thome 
scored 12 points and tallied five 
rebounds against Wayne State.

Though opposing Big Ten 

defenses will now have tape 
to game plan for her, Thome’s 
experience and increased 
strength will be valuable for 
Michigan. Also, the increased 
depth will help Thome stay out of 
foul trouble, something that was 
an issue last year.

“I’ve worked a lot on strength 

and conditioning,” Thome 
said. “Being able to combat the 
strength of the Big Ten and what 
everyone has, as a freshman I 
knew that I had to get used to. As 
a sophomore, being able to come 
in and surprise the Big Ten, even 
though it might not look like I 
gained a lot of muscle, it’s there 
and able to combat what they’ll 
throw at me.”

With the high expectations 

placed on Michigan this year, it is 
important to keep them in check. 

No. 5 Maryland made a strong 

case that it is the best team in 
the Big Ten, as the Terrapins 
came up with staggering wins 
over Bluefield State, 146-17, 
and Mary Baldwin, 153-27, in 
exhibition play. 

No. 7 Ohio State will also 

prove to be a major obstacle for 
the Wolverines, as Buckeye guard 
Kelsey Mitchell was named to 
the preseason All-American 
first team. No. 23 Indiana 
and Michigan State — which 
narrowly missed inclusion in the 
AP Top 25 — will be formidable 
opponents as well. 

But considering the experience 

the Wolverines have this year, the 
depth Michigan now has, and its 
success in the WNIT the last two 
seasons, the Wolverines have a 
great opportunity to attain their 
first NCAA berth since 2012-13, 
Barnes Arico’s first season.

As Barnes Arico enters fifth season at 
Michigan, Wolverines built to score

‘Every program needs a Danielle Williams’

After a Wayne State basket early 

in the first quarter of the Michigan 
women’s basketball team’s Nov. 3 
exhibition, guard Siera Thompson 
rushed the ball up the court before 
the Warriors could get set and 
found guard Danielle Williams 
running toward the basket for an 
easy layup.

It would be fair to say that 

Thompson and Williams — the 
two-year captains and lone seniors 
on a young, energetic Michigan 
team — are no strangers to such a 
routine play. But while Thompson 
was just taking care of business as 
an established star in the program, 
Williams was already having an 
above average performance.

Ever since Williams arrived 

at Michigan in 2013 to join the 
women’s basketball team, her 
opportunities to display her skills 
have been few and far between.

Williams has averaged just 

1.4 points and 11.4 minutes per 
game in her 84 collegiate games, 
numbers that aren’t going to 
catch anyone’s eye. It seems 
remarkable that someone who 
plays just a quarter of the game 
winds up as a team captain for 
not one, but two seasons. 

Yet despite Williams’ stat line, 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
had nothing but gratitude for what 
she has done for the team, mincing 
no words when talking about the 
point guard at the team’s media 
day in early October.

“Every 
program 
needs 
a 

Danielle Williams,” Barnes Arico 
said with a smile. “If my child could 
ever be like Danielle Williams, I 
would’ve hit a home run.”

With a Michigan roster that 

features the likes of Thompson 
and All-American guard Katelynn 
Flaherty, it requires a special 
character to receive the kind of 
praise that Williams got from her 
coach. But Williams’ leadership 

and character have been in the 
making since she first picked up a 
basketball, and have finally been 
realized in her final season at 
Michigan.

These 
traits 
would 
not 

have come about without the 
competition that has surrounded 
Williams all her life. That’s no 
surprise given she has two older 
siblings who played sports in 
college and an equally athletic 
twin 
sister, 
Dominique, 
who 

currently 
plays 
basketball 
at 

UCLA. Regardless of the age 
gaps, Danielle would always shoot 
around or play one-on-one against 
her siblings to showcase her 
athleticism and work on her craft.

“There was a lot of rivalry,” 

Williams said. “We’re a pretty 
competitive family. Even when 
(Dominique and I) would play 
with my older brother and sister, it 
was pretty competitive.”

Up 
until 
college, 
Danielle 

and her Dominique were nearly 
inseparable on the court. Whether 
it was their in-house rivalry or 
collective 
dominance 
during 

high school and AAU basketball 
games — where they sometimes 
competed against older age groups 
and men’s teams — they constantly 
worked to make each other better. 
And that’s why it was such a shock 
when they decided to go separate 
routes for college. 

“It was difficult to realize we 

won’t be on the same team ever 
again,” Danielle said. “We’ll be 
playing against each other.”

Despite taking different paths, 

they still share something in 
common: the number 20.

They both sport 20 to honor 

current 
Indiana 
Fever 
guard 

Briann January.

The 
Williams 
sisters 
have 

adored January ever since they 
were growing up in Phoenix, Ariz., 
loving basketball and watching 
January play at nearby Arizona 
State. January also helped coach 
the AAU teams that the sisters 

played for — where they got to 
develop a relationship with the 
WNBA player, with whom they 
still speak occasionally.

Danielle particularly admired 

January’s 
style 
of 
play 
and 

swagger on the court, something 
that she tried to incorporate into 
her own game as she became a 
budding star in high school.

Being apart from her sister 

was tough, but moving across the 
country to Michigan proved not to 
be as difficult.

Williams committed to the 

Wolverines 
at 
the 
beginning 

of the summer after her junior 
year of high school. She had 
fielded offers from a number of 
Division I schools, but she fell 
in love with Michigan’s campus 
and the players she met during 
an 
unofficial 
visit, 
and 
was 

uninterested in East Coast schools 

she visited afterward.

“This 
place 
is 
awesome,” 

Williams said. “It seemed like I 
could be successful with whatever 
I did here and that was the goal 
for me. I really believed in Coach 
Arico’s vision.

“I visited in June, and (Barnes 

Arico and her staff) had just gotten 
the job in April. They just offered 
to take me around campus in their 
free time. It was springtime, too. 
They could’ve been doing their 
own thing.”

Williams’ transition to Ann 

Arbor from Phoenix encountered 
the difficulties one would expect 
for an out-of-state freshman: cold 
weather, figuring out bus routes 
and 
balancing 
practices 
and 

academics.

Her 
transition 
was 
made 

smoother, however, with the help 
of some of the older players on the 

team — namely 2015 graduates 
Cyesha Goree, Shannon Smith, 
and Nicole Elmblad, who were 
juniors when Williams was a 
freshman. The way those three 
mentored her on and off the court 
was something that Williams 
wanted to emulate when it came 
time for her to lead the team.

Two years later, when those 

three left, Williams was named 
Michigan’s captain and earned the 
chance to follow them.

While her junior campaign 

was statistically her best season 
on the court for the Wolverines, 
her impact lay in the newfound 
role she served. Williams and 
Thompson became conduits for 
the Michigan players and coaching 
staff, acting in motivational roles 
for the team and as a channel of 
communication between the rest 
of the team and the coaches.

“She’s a kid that understands 

her role, but she wants to give a 
significant amount to our team 
and she wants to contribute,” 
Barnes Arico said.

Added 
Williams: 
“If 
(my 

teammates are) doing well and 
being successful, then I’m being 
successful, too. That makes me 
really happy to see people’s growth. 
It’s hard to see it in yourself, so 
when other people recognize it, it 
helps when you’re struggling.”

Now in her senior season, 

she has a full year of experience 
as captain under her belt and 
continues her role as the vocal 
middleman 
for 
players 
and 

coaches.

This 
sentiment 
is 
felt 

throughout the team, which views 
Williams not only as a friend, but 
as someone to look up to.

“We call her the mom of the 

team,” 
said 
freshman 
guard 

Akienreh Johnson. “Mom … she 
does stuff that maybe the kids 
don’t like but she does it because 
she knows that it will help us. 
Danielle is the person to make 
sure we’re in line. She’s not 

our babysitter, but she gives us 
reminders and helps us out. I don’t 
think she knows how much that 
really helps.”

Williams has thrived in her 

role as captain, but she has also 
shown flashes of the talent on 
the hardwood that brought her 
to Michigan in the first place. 
Her 
most 
defining 
moment 

came during last season’s WNIT 
quarterfinals 
against 
Temple, 

where Williams drew a charging 
foul with just 4.6 seconds left in 
regulation to seal a 77-76 victory. 
Williams described that moment 
as “awesome,” but she says she’s 
never been one for the spotlight.

“I could play the whole game 

and have a great game, and if we 
lose it doesn’t matter,” Williams 
said. “My mindset is ‘Why would 
I want to go somewhere else and 
play a more prominent role when 
I have the ability to get better and 
push myself here?’ ”

As Williams approaches her 

final season, it’s fair to say that she’s 
been put through the wringer with 
Michigan basketball. She went from 
starting 20 times in her sophomore 
season to just seven her junior year. 
Only once has she gotten either 
double-digit points or rebounds. 
She’s 
endured 
three 
straight 

seasons of WNIT eliminations. 
And high expectations loom for 
the NCAA Tournament in her final 
go-around.

But her legacy transcends what 

has happened on the court, despite 
the fact that she’s content to be a 
role player for the greatness she 
expects from Michigan women’s 
basketball.

Michigan has the offensive 

and defensive weapons to make 
a tourney run, but Barnes Arico 
knows that it simply wouldn’t be 
a possibility without Williams on 
the roster.

“There’s not a day that goes by,” 

Barnes Arico said, “that I’m not 
thankful that Danielle Williams is 
in the program.”

Senior guard Danielle Williams has not had abundant playing time at Michigan.

B1G Breakdown: Terps on top

Once again, Michigan will see 

red on its road to the top of the 
Big Ten — the top two teams the 
Wolverines will be attempting 
to box out will be Maryland and 
Ohio State. But if the season 
plays out in their favor, they 
won’t experience deja vu and 
once again be passed over for an 
NCAA Tournament bid. 

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team hasn’t been 
selected to compete in the NCAA 
Tournament since the 2012-13 
season — coinciding with the 
first year coach Kim Barnes 
Arico headed the program. 

In the past three years, the 

Wolverines have been outplayed, 
barely, in outlier games and 
have instead been sent to the 
Women’s National Invitational 
Tournament, where they have 
not been able to advance past the 
semifinals. 

This year, though, could be 

different. A rising “superstar” 
freshman class, according to 
Barnes Arico, mixed with key 
players 
like 
junior 
forward 

Katelynn 
Flaherty 
and 

sophomore guard Hallie Thome, 
could possess the ingredients 
needed to break into the NCAA 
Tournament. 

The Daily breaks down who 

Michigan’s 
top 
conference 

competition will be on the 
path to its first potential NCAA 
appearance in five years. 

No. 6 Maryland:
Ranked fifth in the Associated 

Press poll, the Terrapins are the 
strongest team in the conference 
and are entering their third season 
in the Big Ten. Though Michigan 
dominated Wayne State in its 
final preseason exhibition match, 
93-41, Maryland upped the ante 
by demolishing Mary Baldwin, 
153-27. The triple digits came from 
a strong freshman class, including 
Jenna Staiti, who contributed 
25 points and eight rebounds. 
Returning player Shatori Walker-

Kimbrough will be hard to defend, 
too, as the senior guard set the Big 
Ten record in 3-point field-goal 
percentage and was the Big Ten 
Tournament Most Outstanding 
Player last year. 

The Terrapins were picked 

to win the Big Ten title by both 
league coaches and the media 
panels for the second year in a 
row, which makes it an uphill 
battle for the Wolverines to pick 
off their new competition. 

No. 7 Ohio State: 
The next biggest threat to the 

Wolverines is the Buckeyes, who 
have junior Kelsey Mitchell, the 
Big Ten’s Preseason Player of the 
Year. Ohio State was chosen to 
finish second in the conference, 
and the effort will no doubt be 
led by Mitchell. Other players to 
focus on will be senior Ameryst 
Alston, who has finished with 
first team All-Big Ten honors 
in each year of her collegiate 
career. The Buckeyes went 26-8 
last year with a 16-1 home record 
— something to look out for 
considering it is the only time the 
Wolverines and Buckeyes will 
meet in Columbus this year. 

Michigan State: 
The Spartans received the 

22nd spot in the USA TODAY 
Coaches Poll, but slid out of 
the AP Poll rankings. Under 
the nine-year tutelage of Suzy 
Merchant, the Spartans have 
finished in the top three in the 
Big Ten in seven of the last eight 
seasons. Their only hiccup was 
their 2014-15 year, in which the 
Spartans had multiple players 
suffer injuries and finished 16-15. 

Indiana:
The Hoosiers were picked 

to finish third in the Big Ten, 
but find themselves left out of 
all preseason rankings, despite 
finishing last season with a 14-0 
home record. With the recent 
hire of a new assistant coach, 
Glenn Box, Indiana is looking 
to jumpstart its defense and 
perimeter play. 

Purdue:
The Boilermakers have a 

senior duo who are each aiming 
for the 1,000-point club, Ashley 
Morrissette and Bridget Perry. 
The pair were the only two in 
their recruiting class and are 
both in position to achieve a 
feat that just 30 players have 
accomplished in 42 years of 
program history. Purdue is 
also returning five of its top-
six scorers, including three 
starters. 

Iowa :
Hawkeyes coach Lisa Bluder 

is entering her 17th year at the 
helm of the program. She has 
been named Big Ten Coach of 
the Year three times and has led 
her team to nine consecutive 
postseason 
appearances. 
The 

Hawkeyes will be looking to 
repeat the success of their 2014-
15 season and head to the Sweet 
Sixteen. The charge will be led 
by senior Ally Disterhoft, who 
was named a Preseason All-Big 
Ten selection. 

Michigan loaded with scorers

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team didn’t lose much 
star power with the departure 
of last season’s seniors. And 
with a top-20 recruiting class to 
fill the void the seniors left, the 
Wolverines are primed for their 
first NCAA Tournament run since 
the 2012-13 season.

Michigan finished 21-14 last 

season and is coming off its 
second consecutive year of being 
eliminated 
from 
the 
WNIT 

semifinals after suffering a 71-62 
defeat to Florida Gulf Coast.

While 
the 
team 
is 
still 

young, the coaching staff, led 
by Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico, is in its third straight year 
together and is built around a big 
three of Katelynn Flaherty, Siera 
Thompson and Hallie Thome.

Guards:
If last year is any indication, the 

Wolverines will want to make use 
of their depth at the guard position 
by keeping three on the court as 
often as possible.

As the only Wolverine to gain 

national attention, junior Katelynn 
Flaherty spearheads the team 
from the point. With an average 
of 22.1 points per game and a 40 
percent average from behind the 
arc last season, Michigan will rely 
on her as its main offensive threat.

Senior Siera Thompson started 

all 35 games last year, and unless 
something 
drastic 
happens, 

Barnes Arico is expected to keep 
her on the court for at least half of 
each game. Thompson is known 
for her consistency, putting up an 
average of 9.4 points per game. 
But her real contribution to the 
frontcourt is her playmaking 
ability — Thompson averages more 
assists than any other Wolverine.

Senior Danielle Williams will 

be fighting for a starting position 
once again this year. While she 
didn’t average many minutes — 
just 12.7 last season — she brings 
experience to the group of guards. 
Williams is also one of Michigan’s 
best rebounders, which could 
prove to be essential to this year’s 
team.

The first guard off the bench 

will likely be native Michigander 
and freshman Kysre Gondrezick. 
Gondrezick was Ms. Basketball 
her senior year, averaging 40.5 
points per game and posting a high 
school women’s basketball record 
of 72 points in a playoff game. If 
she can continue sinking shots at 
the collegiate level, she could be 
a real difference-maker once she 
grows acclimated to the faster 
pace of the game. 

Sophomores Nicole Munger 

and Boogie Brozoski will provide 
a shooting threat off the bench for 
the Wolverines. Munger received 
sparse playing time in her first 
season, but still maintained a .368 
3-point percentage, while Brozoski 
mustered a .426 percentage from 
beyond the arc. 

Forwards:
With 
such 
a 
guard-heavy 

lineup, Michigan will have to rely 
on the durability of its forwards to 
maintain a solid rebounding and 
low-post presence.

The Wolverines lost two solid 

rebounders with the graduations 
of Kelsey Mitchell and Madison 
Ristovski, but they should be 
more than capable of making up 
for it with a more experienced 
frontcourt.

Junior Jillian Dunston leads the 

forwards, coming off a sophomore 
campaign in which she averaged 
4.4 points and a team-high 5.6 
boards per game. Dunston should 
see an expanded role this year, as 
the Wolverines will rely on her 
more often on the defensive end.

Besides 
Dunston, 
the 
rest 

of the forwards haven’t seen 
much playing time. Sophomore 
Sam Trammel and junior Maria 
Backman have both played on 
the court at the collegiate level, 
but neither of them have received 
regular playing time. Freshmen 
KeAsja Peace and Kayla Robbins 
stand at 6-foot-3 and 6-foot-1, 
respectively, but may not be able to 
see much playing time.

Center:
Six-foot-five sophomore Hallie 

Thome is Michigan’s only true 
center. 
The 
frontcourt 
talent 

finished last season scoring in 
the double digits for 25 out of the 
35 games. Thome is an important 
returning starter who became just 
the second freshman in program 
history to record 500 points and 
and set a school single-season 
record in field-goal percentage 
(63.1). The All-Big Ten honorable 
mention is the tallest athlete on 
the team — for now.

Redshirt junior Abby Cole is 

also 6-foot-5 and will be joining 
the Wolverines after her volleyball 
season ends in December. Her 
transition to basketball is highly 
anticipated, as her physical stature 
will literally push Michigan to 
new heights. Though Cole hasn’t 
touched a basketball since high 
school — four years ago — Barnes 
Arico is confident that she will 
complement Thome at center.

We are good, bad, and ugly:

Embracing free artisitic spirit and consumerism at ComplexCon

COMPLEXCON
From Page 1B

ComplexCon. Part of speech: 

noun. Language of origin: the 
youth’s English. Definition: uh, 
well ...

Definition? That’s a great ques-

tion.

From Nov. 5 to Nov. 6 at the Long 

Beach Convention and Entertain-
ment Center in California, Complex 
magazine hosted ComplexCon, its 
inaugural … convention? Festival? 
Hypebeast cooperative? What are 
we to label this weekend of cloth-
ing releases, food, art, music and 
guest speakers? Its website calls it 
the first ever cultural World’s Fair.

After experiencing ComplexCon 

for myself, I think I’m ready to give 
you an answer.

Before I go any further, here’s 

what you should know about the 
events that ensued over those two 
days: Picture a warehouse-like 
convention center full of pop-up 
shops selling the most in-demand 
streetwear brands out there (think 
Adidas, A Bathing Ape and every-
thing in between). Add a myriad of 
food trucks, art exhibitions, guest 
speakers and musicians to the mix 
and you’ve got yourself a Complex-
Con sandwich.

Now, let’s get analytical.
ComplexCon represents con-

sumerism. Nearly every featured 
clothing brand designed a capsule 
collection to be sold exclusively 
at the event, making pre-existing 
Hypebeast 
undertones 
wildly 

potent. Every shop opened simul-
taneously at 10 a.m. both days. By 
9:55, young boys and grown men 
alike could be seen darting from 
vendor to vendor, hoping to secure 
a pair of Nike Special Field Air 
Force Ones while still finding time 
to cop the latest tee from Vlone. 
And what for? Why, all in the name 
of money, of course.

“Even if you wear a piece and 

then resell it, you’ll still make dou-
ble what you spent,” explained a 
wiry tween from his place in the 
Nike line. “Me and my friend came 
to do that, and we’ll make $1,500 
to $10,000 easily. It’s really that 
simple.”

Though it was fascinating to 

watch people fawn over overpriced 
Gildan shirts emblazoned with par-
ticular symbols, I couldn’t help but 
wonder whether ComplexCon was 
promoting fashion or pure busi-
ness. One of the weekend’s most 
popular affairs was a series of ongo-
ing raffles that offered winners the 
opportunity to buy a pair of shoes. 
You read that correctly. Hundreds 
of entrants paid for the chance to 
be able to buy $180 sneakers. As one 
attendee noted, “It’s consumerism 
disguised as culture. It’s trying to 
sell you this idea of what’s cool and 
what’s happening, but really, it’s 
just capitalism.”

That weekend, consumerism 

existed not only as a means of com-
merce, but as a means of worship. 
Celebrities unveiled clothing col-
laborations left and right, from 
Pharrell at G-Star to Metro Boo-
min at Puma. At one point, I found 
myself inside a mass of adolescents 

crowded outside Urban Outfitters. 
We were waiting the arrival of our 
dear leader, none other than Lil 
Yachty, who happened to be run-
ning more than 40 minutes late to 
his own meet-and-greet.

When the red-haired sensation 

did arrive to the hub of his sweaty 
young fan base, their reactions 
felt practically spiritual. Dozens 
of young boys rushed from spot to 
spot, testing out the view from their 
tiptoes, all in the hopes of getting a 
glance at their trendy patron saint.

The weekend’s female pres-

ence was minimal. Technically 
speaking, every part of Complex-
Con could be considered gender-
neutral, but it’s the man we tend to 
think of when custom sports cars 
are placed on display to advertise a 
clothing brand (I’m looking at you, 
Bape, and your purple-camo Lam-
borghini).

The 
only 
overtly 
feminine 

aspect of the event was an activa-
tion curated by women’s lifestyle 
site MissBish in conjunction with 
Colourpop, 
an 
up-and-coming 

makeup brand taking Instagram 
and YouTube by storm. Hair styl-
ing, makeup application and free 
samples were all offered within the 
marble-lined space. I could think 
of no better way to escape from a 
testosterone-heavy weekend than 
sipping on a free coffee from Alfred 
Coffee (provided by online retailer 
Five Four) while a sweet young 
woman twisted my hair into the 
most impeccable French braids 
ever to have graced my scalp.

In spite of the lack of estrogen 

involved, the convention center felt 
like a remarkably inclusive space. 
No race seemed to overpower the 
others; Black, white, Latino and 
Asian co-existed in a harmonious 
rhythm accompanied by hip hop. 
Walking from vendor to vendor, 
activation to activation, I heard 
as wide a variety of languages as 
one would on a typical New York 
City street. Sure, the Hypebeast 
phenomenon is rooted in com-
mercial value, but that value is one 
understood across a color wheel 
of nationalities, cultures, back-
grounds and ethnicities.

ComplexCon may have ben-

efited many corporations, but it 
also fostered a free-flowing artistic 
spirit unlike any I have ever seen. 
Thought-provoking 
installations 

by mixed media artist Patrick Mar-
tinez, a Culver City-based gallery 
called Think Space and a multi-
tude of other art-world favorites 
provided a much-needed breath 
of fresh air to an otherwise stuffy, 
and alarmingly fluorescent, space. 
My personal favorite was an exhi-
bition featuring a giant interactive 
ball that, when touched, displayed 
a variety of designs by Takashi 
Murakami, the mastermind behind 
ComplexCon’s graphics and much 
of Kanye West’s album art. It was 
largely thanks to his efforts that 
the weekend felt artistic to the core.

The food trucks outside the 

venue were, actually, the icing on 
the cake. Churros, tacos and coffee 
of every variety I could imagine (if 
we’ve ever met, you know that’s a 
lot) were available for the buying. 

Coolhaus’s ice cream truck got me 
through both days, for better or 
worse.

Oh, right! There was also music, 

and a wide variety, at that. The 
weekend kicked off with Insta-
gram star and DJ Chantel Jeffries, 
progressing to performances by a 
diverse variety of artists as the day 
went on. Though I was not granted 
night access, the word on the street 
Sunday morning was that Kid 
Cudi’s show the night before had 
changed lives. Sunday’s lineup held 
the same level of versatility, featur-
ing artists such as DJ Virgil Abloh, 
Lil Yachty, Travis Scott and the 
ubiquitous face of both hip hop and 
marijuana, none other than Snoop 
Dogg.

“It was amazing to perform 

here,” Jeffries exclaimed after her 
set. “It’s a great venue and a great 
event. I’m super happy to be here.”

Let’s ride this wave of positiv-

ity a little while longer, shall we? 
If ComplexCon’s backbone was 
made of money, its soul was built 
upon the wisdom of its Complex 
Conversations 
panelists. 
Twit-

ter sensation and self-proclaimed 
“Based God” Lil B proved, among 
a series of enthusiastic head-nods, 
that activism can take many forms 
in “The Future of Activism, Mobi-
lization and Making a Difference.” 
Throughout “The Music Genera-
tion Gap Debate,” contemporary 
rapper Vince Staples defended 
today’s youth in a heated debate 
with Raekwon, Scarface, French 
Montana, DJ Mustard and Pete 
Rock, moderated by none other 
than radio personality Angie Mar-
tinez.

Most astounding to me were Ice 

Cube and Tony Hawk successfully 
showing that there is no one viable 
life path in a panel entitled “Achiev-
ing Longevity in the Game.” The 
two spoke like old friends, capi-
talizing on their different experi-
ences to produce a guidebook of 
life advice from the World’s Coolest 
Dads. Caps intended.

“You have to make up your mind 

on your vision of success,” Ice Cube 
concluded toward the panel’s end. 
“Some people think it’s money, 
some people think it’s fame. I’d 
rather have somebody come up 
to me and say ‘I like what you did 
there, I like that.’ That’s what I get 
off on.” Nodding in agreement, 
Hawk added his two cents: “If 
you’ve really got that heart and that 
passion, you’re going to rise up.”

So how, exactly, would I define 

ComplexCon?

Part of speech and language of 

origin aside, it is a movement. It 
stands for a generation’s addiction 
to consumerism, our yearning for 
fame. It presents an opportunity 
to make something of this modern 
disposition. It signifies a tolerant 
new form of masculinity. It is cre-
ativity. It is appreciation. It rep-
resents the youth’s desire to learn 
from those they look up to.

Our generation defines Com-

plexCon. We are good, we are bad 
and we are ugly, and we are willing 
to own every bit of it.

Put that in your book, Merriam-

Webster.

COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

I

f I were to write this and 
keep it saved on my lap-
top for only me to see, it 

would remain an isolated cre-
ation. 

By offering it 

to someone else, 
I have just sur-
rendered a bit of 
control. Now they 
read my words. 
They think. They 
analyze. 
They 

conclude.

The 
tricky 

part about writ-
ing 
is 
whether 

you’re 
engaging 

in it under a rigid academic 
standard or simply as cre-
ative expression — the minute 
it moves from an individual’s 
thoughts to another’s eyes, 
there is an element of the writ-
ing’s solitude that cannot be 
restored. However, that’s the 
way it should be or perhaps 
has to be, in order for a piece 
of writing to grow to be com-
plex, engaging and curious. 
The more isolated the writing 
experience, the less connection 
between new thoughts outside 
of your own. These various 
perspectives 
could 
possibly 

prevent a piece towards devel-
oping more meaning and depth 
as a result of others’ ideas.

Writing is entirely a social 

practice, even though in many 
contexts, it isn’t seen as one. 
An essay typically goes from a 
Word doc to a professor’s com-
puter. No one else is involved 
in the creation or reflection 
of a piece and because of that, 
something valuable is lost. This 
limited transaction prevents a 
writer’s growth and deprives 
them of the benefits of sharing 
and collaborating, which are 
both essential to the writing 
process.

For many years, I was never 

open to people reading any-
thing 
I 
produced. 
Writing 

relies on personal experiences, 
which I had always consid-

ered best left in 
the realms of my 
own 
imagination. 

It reveals vulner-
ability that I never 
wanted others to 
access 
and 
the 

idea of keeping my 
writing 
between 

me (and only me) 
was always more 
appealing 
than 

sharing it.

It’s not always 

ideal to include others in such 
exposure. Some of the best 
advice offered to me about my 
writing, especially during col-
lege, is to willingly accept the 
value of the exchange. Writ-
ing that is complex and engag-
ing has to be shared and open 
to critique, forcing a writer’s 
reevaluation or maybe just 
sparking a new thought. That 
isn’t to say that all feedback 
must be applied to a work 
just because someone thinks 
changes are necessary. Often, 
it just illuminates something 
that the writer wouldn’t have 
otherwise seen unless someone 
else read it and shared their 
reactions.

What you’re reading now is 

tailored for an audience. I’m 
not following a prompt or spe-
cific style. For many writers, 
their content is altered when 
their audience is reimagined. 
With that, I consider ways to 
engage a reader with my work 
and force them to think or pon-
der their own ideas towards my 
writing. I also consider what 
I can do as a writer to appeal 
to readers and how I can find 
ways to coherently express 
thoughts I have about a topic 
on the page in front of me.

Workshop is an effective 

way for a writer to grow as 
well. Not because the feed-
back from peers or friends is 
always something writers want 
to hear, but instead because it 
forces them down two differ-
ent paths. The first: they hear 
the thoughts of others and are 
able to alter their piece in a way 
that satisfies those concerns, 
which presumably also satis-
fies the writer. The second is 
allowing criticism or varying 
perspectives to reinforce the 
writer’s initial choices. It isn’t 
that you have to be told you’re 
wrong; it could just be another 
way to convince yourself that 
your choices as a writer are 
intentional and will ultimately 
be successful.

Writers often want to receive 

assurance that their piece of 
writing, whatever it is, is com-
municating meaning. But with 
that motivation from others, 
we don’t necessarily want their 
opinion. I seek approval, but 
critique, especially in the early 
writing stages, seems detri-
mental to my incentive to keep 
going. It’s incredibly hard to 
verbalize some of the thought 
processes behind writing dur-
ing its stages of development, 
which often discourages my 
thoughts toward sharing my 
writing.

Regardless of the existing 

insecurities, writing acts as 
a tool to persuade, teach and 
inspire. The best way to do 
that is to be open to engage-
ment apart from just your own 
thoughts put to the page. We 
are relational, social beings—
don’t let your writing experi-
ence be left out of that.

RCA RECORDS

Everyone watch his NPR Tiny Desk concert. You’re welcome.

The year was 2008, and rap-

pers like Flo Rida, Plies and T.I. 
were at peak relevancy. One in 
particular, however, was on top of 
the world. Born Faheem Rashad 
Najm, “T-Pain,” a Tallahassee, Fl. 
product, exploded onto the main-
stream scene with Epiphany in 
2007. Both singles from the proj-
ect, “Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snap-
pin’)” and “Bartender,” became 
megahits and launched the Auto-
Tune-dependent 
rapper/singer 

onto a new level of fame. “Buy 
U A Drank,” especially, remains 
iconic and one of the enduring 
anthems of the mid-to-late 2000s. 
His brand had elevated himself to 
a somewhat untouchable level. He 
was, elegantly — and more effec-
tively than anybody else — spitting 
game.

Weddings, on the other hand, 

traditionally spit, uh, tradition. 
They all essentially follow the 
same basic formula in both order 
and detail, leading to occasion-
ally redundant ceremonies. For 
example, “Canon in D” and “The 
Bridal Chorus” are two proces-
sional 
mainstays; 
time-tested, 

respectable compositions that act 
not only as orchestral background 
but social standard as well. Clas-
sic? Sure, but for an increasingly 
(generally speaking) experimen-
tal wedding crowd, there needs to 

be a valid alternative. R&B (past 
and present) has a natural place in 
any type of love affair, and even if 
it hasn’t become a common trend 
yet, promising young artists keep 
churning out risqué, wedding-
ready songs. What better way, 
then, to infuse some new-school 
suave into an arguably outdated 
institution and jumpstart the trend 
than with some T-Pain?

His sound was almost made 

for this type of setting. His third 
album, Three Ringz (2008), had 
certifiable 
hits 
(“Chopped 
N 

Skrewed,” “Freeze,” and “It Ain’t 
Me” were destined for national 
airwaves as soon as they were 
released), but nothing was as pure-
ly masterful and versatile as “Can’t 
Believe It.” Nothing can come close 
to its ultra-romantic tone, which 
epitomizes lovey-dovey T-Pain. 
And nothing is better fit to marry 
those in love.

T-Pain himself exhibits infinite 

charm in making sure everyone 
understands he’s ready to commit. 
No matter where he is, whether 
it’s a “log cabin, somewhere in 
Aspen,” or a “mansion, somewhere 
in Wisconsin,” he’ll do whatever it 
takes to make his significant other 
happy. His love transcends any set-
ting, as should the love of newly-
weds. A matrimony soundtracked 
by such an exquisite slow jam is 
certainly an auspicious beginning 
to a healthy, daring relationship.

There could, however, be some 

understandable resentment to this 
movement. Old souls might not 
be comfortable with the extent of 
sensuality in the ballad. That being 
said, such raunchiness seems to fit 
the maturity level of this new gen-
eration. The song is slow. It’s sen-
sual. The pace is tailor-made for a 
walk down the aisle in which the 
bride (or groom, or parents, or all 
of the above) can absorb the love 
in the air. Coordinate each step 
with the snap of the beat and watch 
the audience feel the vibe as well. 
(Chop the mix before Lil Wayne’s 
inaudible verse to save the grand-
parents from hearing in-depth 
sexual play-by-play).

This innovation can potentially 

lay the foundation for later espous-
al lovesounds. Dvsn, an up-and-
coming Drake cosign, hasn’t quite 
enjoyed the mainstream success 
that allowed “Can’t Believe It” to 
gain such notoriety, but its sound 
on debut album Sept. 5th, namely 
in “Hallucinations,” follows a for-
mula similar to T-Pain’s. Along 
with Majid Jordan and, to a lesser 
extent, Bryson Tiller, a new wave 
of slow jams can surely find them-
selves riding “Can’t Believe It” 
hypothetical wake in the arena of 
new-age wedding processionals. 
It could, and should, be the norm 
sometime soon. This might not 
be a welcome change for all, but 
it’s an experiment worth trying, 
and T-Pain can rightfully claim 
responsibility for all of it.

Thursday, November 10, 2016 — 3B

 In 2009, Kid Cudi released 
Man on the Moon: The End of 
Day, a now-iconic debut album 
that redefined vulnerability’s 
place in rap and, consequently, 
resonated with a cultish fan 
base. The attention caught up 
to the Cleveland rapper, how-
ever. In 2013, he opened up 
about his perpetual troubles 
with addiction and depression, 
culminating in a visit to rehab 
this October for depression and 
suicidal urges.
 This news was, and remains, 
tough to bear for such a devoted 
fan base. One of these fans was 
OG Maco (he of “U Guessed It” 
fame), who this week released 
For Scott, a tribute mixtape in 
honor of Cudi’s recent return to 
the public eye.
 “At Night” is the standout 

track, for better 
or worse. The 
casual listener 
can hear what 
OG Maco tried 
to do, as he 
twirls over 
production that’s 
equally (and simultaneously) 
unapologetic and Cudi-
esque. While bland, this 
could have sufficed, if not for 
underwhelming bars: “Halfway 
late, dancin’ with the devil have 
one hell of a day / And the great 
escape must be another n***a 
fate.”
 What was probably intended 
as heavy-handed thematic 
implication — Cudi’s certainly 
had many an interaction with 
devilish temptation — comes 
off as flat, or even apathetic. We 

get that Cudi, 
or OG Maco 
for that matter, 
hasn’t been 
able to escape 
his demons 
(and instead 
watches others 

achieve what he so yearns to 
do) but it doesn’t quite hit us.
 What results is a product that 
requires compartmentalizing. 
Acting as a morale boost in light 
of Cudi’s worst stretch of per-
sonal adversity yet, it’s appro-
priately tortured. As a message 
of comfort for a friend, it’s suf-
ficient. As a singular piece of 
music, it’s inappropriately bad. 
Kid Cudi deserves more, even if 
it’s meant to be the thought that 
counts.

“At Night”

OG Maco

Betts DeHart is a 20-year-old 

Atlanta native and co-founder 
of streetwear label Lucid FC, 
which he started alongside 
his twin brother, Chet. I sat 
down with him at Complex 
Magazine’s 
first 
annual 

ComplexCon, where Lucid FC 
was a vendor, to discuss how 
the twins got their start, what 
they’ve done since and where 
they see themselves going.

Will 
you 
tell 
me 
the 

condensed version of how 
Lucid FC came about? I know 
there’s a lot to that story.

So, back in 2010, my twin, 

Chet, and I were about to start 
high school. We were at a point 
in our lives where we needed to 
decide what we wanted to do, I 
guess, but it was kind of early. 
We knew we really wanted to 
do footwear. When we started 
our brand, it was just Lucid 
Footwear. And it just made 
sense a couple months later 
to add clothing. That’s where 
the “C” in our name comes 
from. Lucid FC, footwear and 
clothing.

You were able to do all of 

this as high schoolers?

We didn’t really go to a 

normal high school. It was 
most similar to homeschool, 
but it wasn’t at our house, and 
it wasn’t our parents teaching 
us. Chet and I did a work-
study program there, so the 
curriculum we did for school 
was around our business. It 
was a self-curated curriculum.

Will you take me up to 

where Lucid FC is now? How 
have you guys progressed 
since high school?

Well, we’re still kind of young 

to have a brand. So we keep 
growing as the brand grows. 

I’ve never done this process 
before, so I’m not as familiar 
as others in the business, but I 
just feel like every day is a new 
growth point for sure. Some 
seasons, we see more growth 
than others, but the growth 
is still pretty steady overall. 
But say you release a new item 
and a celebrity wears it — the 
growth is more impactful for 
that part of time. But it’s a 
steady growth, which is good 
because that’s what I like.

I know Rihanna is in that 

mix of celebrities. What was 
that like?

When Rihanna wears your 

hat, and it’s on ESPN because 
she’s at an NBA game, and 
you see her courtside, and you 
see a whole bunch of pictures, 
and you see your online shop 
notifications going insane, the 
impact is huge. Different items 
vary, but celebrities bring in 
huge, huge progress. When you 
compare the numbers, you can 
see that they play a very big 
role.

Do you know how she got a 

hold of the hat?

She bought it!
She just found Lucid FC’s 

site?

She bought it from VFiles, 

actually.

How did you guys get 

involved with VFiles in the 
first place?

They’re the first store to 

carry our clothes. Chet and 
I were customers. We’d used 
their website, and soon they 
opened up a store in New York 
in 2012. We were kind of like, 
“Hey, we have a brand, too.” 
And they liked it.

What’s your specific role 

in the brand?

A wise man once said that 

the only two things you need 
for a business are marketing 
and creation, or something 
like that. Although this sounds 
very black and white, Chet is all 
creative and I’m all marketing. 
I handle business matters as 
well, but I mainly specialize in 
marketing. We have the perfect 
balance going.

You 
two 
grew 
up 
in 

Atlanta, correct?

We did. Born and raised. 

When 
college 
would 
have 

started, we moved to New 
York. We lived there for two 
years and then Chet moved to 
London for a year, which is still 
going on, to go study at Central 
Saint Martins.

How 
has 
Atlanta 

influenced what you guys 
have done with Lucid FC? I 
know you’re not directly on 
the design side, but I’m sure 
you have some insight.

The Atlanta aesthetic is like 

nothing else. It’s truly unique. 
It’s very heavily influenced 
by music and food. We’ve 
definitely been influenced by 
the music, not the food.

Before we wrap up, do you 

have any specific goals for 
the brand that you’d like to 
mention?

Yeah, 
win 
the 
CFDA 

(Council of Fashion Designers 
of America) next year.

(Laughs) 
I’d 
expect 

nothing less.

20-year-old fashion designer Betts DeHart joined ComplexCon this weekend with label Lucid FC.

WARNER BROS.

David fire Byrne-in on the dancefloor.

The second he walked onto 

that stage, I fell in love. David 
Byrne circa three decades ago has 
the kind of hair — a dark brown, 
straight yet messy beast — that 
makes girls swoon.

It’s just him and his grey suit 

on stage for the first few intimate 
frames of “Stop Making Sense,” 
Jonathan Demme’s (“The Silence 
of the Lambs”) lauded, barrier-
breaking 
concert 
film, 
which 

enjoyed a screening at the Michigan 
Theater last week. Byrne’s band, 
new wave darlings the Talking 
Heads, performed three nights 
at Hollywood’s Pantages Theater 

in December 1983, and Demme 
caught it all. The smiles, the sweat, 
the exposed ladders and technical 
accoutrement turned digital, bright 
red backdrops — it’s all filmed 
with smooth pans and downright 
stunning close-up shots.

The grooviest aspect, though, 

is the fact that the Talking Heads’ 
best songs — “Psycho Killer,”

Falling in love with ‘Stop Making 
Sense’ once more in this lifetime

Iconic Talking Heads documentary comes back to Michigan Theater

“This Must Be The Place (Naive 
Melody),” “Once in a Lifetime,” etc. 
— play nonstop during it all.

Byrne’s eyes are freaky-wide 

as the camera stays tight in the 
opening scene. He’s 
cringing, “I can’t 
seem to face up to the 
facts / I’m tense and 
nervous and I can’t 
relax,” and neither 
can the anxious 
cinematography. 
We get long shots 
of Byrne’s stark 
white 
sneakers, 

his 
pristine 

cheekbones: 
our 
avant-garde 

Moses is dry and new, singing 
with sonorous chutzpah as he 
guides us on this journey of 
impending sweat and colorful 
cacophony.

Bit by bit, other members of 

the band join him on stage. Tina 
Weymouth, one of the original 
badass band chicks, smokes on 
the bass. She’s donning a baggy 
grey jumpsuit and swinging 
blonde locks as Jerry Harrison 
hops 
alongside 
on 
rhythm 

guitar, and Chris Frantz looks 
like an extra from “Caddyshack” 
in a green polo as he begins to 
bang those essential tom toms. 
By the end, he’ll be soaked in sweat, 
too. These are the Talking Heads.

Frantz and Byrne met while 

studying at the Rhode Island 
School of Design in the early ’70s, 

and formed the band officially 
in ’75. The Heads’ music sounds 
exactly the way you’d think art 
school would sound: off-the-wall 
and 
kitschy, 
with 
inspiration 

pulled 
from 
a 

variety of muses. 
There are tinges 
of 
world 
music, 

punk rock, gospel 
and funk; this sexy 
hodge-podge shows 
in 
the 
concert’s 

staging, 
which 

gets exponentially 
more eye-catching 
as the film rolls 

on. An intense, scarlett backdrop 
accompanies “Swamp.” Everything 
goes dim for “This Must Be The 
Place (Naive Melody),” and you can 
feel the happiness simmering in 
Byrne’s eyes as he smiles, singing, 
fiddling with a lamp: “I got plenty 
of time / You got light in your eyes / 
And you’re standing here beside me 
/ I love the passing of time.” There’s 
also a picture of human buttocks in 
the background.

Part of being human is learning 

to accept the fact that we get 
bored, even at concerts. But “Stop 
Making Sense” never gets boring. 
Even when things start to teeter 
on typical, unorthodoxy prevails. 
Byrne starts seizing on stage in 
between lines of the chorus on 
“Once in a Lifetime,” his body 
gyrating from head-to-toe like an 
impassioned preacher. He pops 

out in a giant gray suit with bigger 
shoulder pads that reduce his head 
to the size of a toe on “Girlfriend 
is Better.” He leaves the stage 
entirely so Frantz and Weymouth 
can perform a song as the Tom 
Tom Club, the married duo’s side 
project, which spawned the smash 
“Genius of Love.”

During this jam, Weymouth 

hunches over, bouncing back and 
forth between each of her bent 
legs as Frantz scratchily yells 
out “JAMES BROWN? JAMES 
BROWN” behind his drumset. All 
of this is nothing short of funk-
driven madness, yes, but it feels 
right — artistic — and it makes the 
film’s 88 minutes unapologetically 
thrilling.

Yet, I fear I’m not making 

sense. It’s difficult to capture the 
fundamental allure of Demme’s 
work in words. I didn’t just watch 
the concert: I was at the concert, 
in 1983, and Byrne was singing 
“Heaven” to me. I could see the 
scratches on his acoustic guitar, 
hear 
every 
imperfection 
and 

perfection. “Heaven / Heaven is 
a place / A place where nothing / 
Nothing ever happens.” It doesn’t 
make sense; I’m not making sense. 
But, with every fiber of life in my 
human limbs, I wanted to jump to 
my feet and applaud after “Heaven” 
was over.

Because I fell in love with David 

Byrne, this odd little talking head. 
And music, too. All over again.

Sense”

You know the story — but 

not like this. From Thursday 
to Sunday, the School of Music, 
Theatre and Dance will present 
Charles Gounod’s opera, “Roméo 
et Juliette,” at the 
Power Center for 
the 
Performing 

Arts. Shakespeare’s 
classic tragedy is 
brought to life by 
the students (in the 
School of Music) 
both onstage and 
in the pit.

Director 
Paul 

Curran, who has 
directed operas at 
the Metropolitan Opera in New 
York City and Royal Opera House 
in London (to name a few places), 
was brought in to direct “Roméo 
et Juliette.” He chose to set this 
particular production of Romeo 
and Juliet in the late 1950s.

“He has this concept that the 

’50s were a transition from a very 
conservative time into a very 
liberal time, which goes along with 
the story of Romeo and Juliet: the 
power of peace and love against 
hatred,” said Mulder, a second 
year Masters student in Vocal 
Performance who plays Juliette. 
“He really wanted to bring out that 
aspect of how the time and the 
community affects the lovers.”

Mulder, who was a Young Artist 

at the Ash Lawn Opera Company 
in Virginia this past summer, 
said the entire experience at the 
University is one of the most 
professional settings she could 
ever imagine.

“Martin Katz, who’s conduct-

ing the opera, is one of the world’s 
most famous collaborative pia-
nists,” Mulder said. “The cos-
tume department, the production 
department, the stage manage-
ment team — everything is so well-
oiled and well running, and the 
orchestra just sounds pristine.”

Darius Gillard, a second year 

Doctor 
of 
Musi-

cal Arts student in 
Vocal Performance, 
plays the part of 
Romeo.

“I’ve had a hand-

ful of professional 
roles, and honestly, 
the production here 
is on an extremely 
high scale,” Gillard 
said.

The production 

is filled with suspense, excitement 
and fight scenes: a special fight 
choreographer was brought in to 
coach the cast members on how 
to correctly perform combat on 
stage.

“It was a fantastic experience,” 

Gillard said on receiving combat 
coaching. “The knives are made 
out of steel, so any wrong choreog-
raphy could lead to someone get-
ting painfully jabbed. Thankfully, 
we had a fight choreographer to 
help us put that together, which 
was amazing.”

“Since we’re using knives, it all 

has to be really precise,” Mulder 
added. “The fight scene is really 
intense.”

The cast rehearses for six 

hours a day — both a huge time 
commitment 
and 
physical 

undertaking.

“We began rehearsing the first 

week of school — we had our first 
rehearsal the first day of classes. 
The whole process took about nine 

weeks,” Mulder said.

Approximately 
three 
hours 

long, there are two intermissions 
throughout the duration of the 
performance. “Bring a snack!” 
Mulder advised.

The 
opera 
is 
performed 

in French, and there will be 
supertitles above the stage.

“I encourage everyone to come 

and see it even if you have no 
experience with foreign language 
because we have supertitles that 
are in English — you will know 
what is happening all the time,” 
Mulder said.

“This performance is a very 

real, honest reflection of life,” 
Gillard said. “It’s a reflection of 
people at their most human — at 
their best and their worst — and 
it also tells a story of how to work 
past differences. It teaches a lesson 
about how prejudice can destroy 
you.”

Mulder said she believes people 

should come see the opera because 
of the story’s power.

“We forget so often how much 

damage hate can do, and we forget 
the importance of acceptance and 
tolerance in our communities. 
In the world we live in today, it’s 
really important to always think 
about that, and think about how 
choosing love instead of hate is 
the better choice. I really do think 
that the story — now more than 
ever — is important for people 
to understand why they need to 
accept those who are different 
from them,” she said.

When asked if there were any 

other modifications made to this 
version of Romeo and Juliet, 
Gillard said: “There is something 
that’s different — but I don’t want 
to give it away! You will absolutely 
know it when you see it.”

FILM REVIEW


EN HOUSE

In “GLITCHED,” the protagonist Gus realizes he’s being controlled by the player.

There’s a certain magic about 

the band that meets in college. 
R.E.M., The Pixies, Queen, Pink 
Floyd — all undeniable legends 
of the music industry that met in 
their dorms, art rooms and archi-
tecture studios. 

En House Studios seems to have 

captured more than a bit of that 
magic. Just this past July, Nikko, 
Zack and Justin — dorm room-
mates who bonded over their 
mutual interest in game develop-
ment after moving into their own 
place — designed a Kickstarter 
for a role-playing game. Against 
a $7,500 goal, the page grossed 
almost $70,000, over nine times 
as much as they asked for. I talked 
over email with the guys to ask 
them about how their Kickstarter, 
the game and their plans for the 
future. They answered as a group, 
representing themselves as a stu-
dio. 

What was the creative pro-

cess for making the Kickstarter 
for “GLITCHED,” and what was 
it like watching it get funded? 
Was it fun or was it a source of 
anxiety? 

Putting together the Kick-

starter took longer than you would 
expect. There was the demo for 
“GLITCHED,” and making sure 
that was working correctly took a 
lot of time. Making sure our Kick-
starter was brief yet included a lot 
of info, and making sure it looked 
good, was definitely a trial and 
error process. Being able to get our 
ideas across clearly and briefly was 
important and took a good amount 
of time.

After we released the Kick-

starter, I think we all coped a little 
differently. For me personally, I 
was an anxious mess for a while 
until I started seeing the success 
we were having — then I was even 
more of an anxious mess knowing 
we were going to have to make the 
full game.

Zack was pretty chill about it. 

The best way to describe it for him 
was that it was a labor of love and 
was happy to see people looking 
at it. The money was nice, but he 
liked the responses to the demo a 
lot more.

Justin just stopped sleeping 

pretty much.

What were some of the rea-

sons you decided to go all in on 
“GLITCHED” instead of pursu-
ing a more standard career?

We’ve gone all in at least for the 

development of “GLITCHED,” 
but we’ll see what happens after. I 

know we’ve discussed more games 
and continuing En House Studios 
after “GLITCHED,” but we’ll talk 
about that some other day.

I think we all believed that we 

could make “GLITCHED” some-
thing special and that we could 
afford to take the risk and see if we 
could make it.

One of the major themes of 

“GLITCHED” (at least in the 
demo) is the idea of agency — the 
protagonist, Gus, begins to feel 
vaguely aware that something 
is controlling him, and forms a 
fourth-wall-breaking relationship 
with the player. Where did this 
idea come from? Were these explo-
rations of power and control stem-
ming from real life anxieties you 
guys had? 

The origin of the idea came from 

a computer program in high school 
actually. For a computer science 
101 class, I coded a small program 
that had a small pixel character 
responding to the person pressing 
things on the keyboard. I took this 
idea of a character responding to 
person sitting at the keyboard and 
expanded it out during my later 
high school years.

When I met Zack and Justin, we 

took this idea and really put more 
thought into it. I think in your early 
college years, everyone feels a cer-
tain way — that there are powers 
and things in control of you seem 
thrusted into the adult world. Per-
haps these feelings helped shape 
“GLITCHED.”

We are all into existentialism 

and existential writers. A lot of 
influences from these sources have 
found their way into “GLITCHED” 
for sure.

You guys are among a very 

small group of indie developers 
working on RPGs. Why do you 
think it is that indies are hesitant 
to make role-playing games? Do 
you see that changing with bet-
ter availability of development 
tools like Unity, RPG Maker and 
Game Maker?

RPG games tend to be lengthy 

and stale. JRPGS and turn-based 
RPGs tend to be very formulaic 
and stale. Of course there are great 
ones, but the genre at this point 
is much slower. I think access to 
these tools is great, but thinking 
outside the box and not following 
the tropes as other games tend to 
do can lead a developer to have a 
fresh idea even in a genre that has 
gotten some flak for repetitiveness.

Can you tell me about some 

of the game’s major influences? 
Was the success of Toby Fox’s 
“Undertale” 
something 
that 

inspired you?

The success of “Undertale” 

definitely was one of the things 
that made us reopen the project. 
We actually failed a Kickstarter 
back around the time “Undertale” 
was on Kickstarter. It took a lot 
to get us re-motivated but playing 
games like “Undertale,” “Lisa” and 
some of the more classic RPGs like 
the “Mother” series and “Paper 
Mario” really got us feeling like we 
could do it.

Justin has always been a “King-

dom Hearts” and “Final Fantasy” 
fan. Square Enix as a company 
should inspire any hopeful RPG 
developers.

Tell me about your working 

process. Do you work in an office 
together? Or remotely? Do you 
see En House making games far 
into the future, or are y’all try-
ing to get jobs elsewhere in the 
industry? 

We actually use my apartment as 

a meeting place. We meet a couple 
times a week but we work separate-
ly pretty much seven days a week 
on “GLITCHED.” We have found 
a good flow in how we share work 
and get things done, which I think 
is important for all start up studios 
to do. Being aware of your budget is 
important to. Not spending on an 
office saves us more for develop-
ment spending. Small things add 
up — especially for a tiny start up. 
Like I said before, we are interested 
in keeping things going but we’ll 
see how we feel after developing 
“GLITCHED.”

What’s the best and worst case 

scenario for how “GLITCHED” 
does in the long run? Is there 
anything you’re worried about?

I think the worst case scenario is 

we stretch ourselves to thin and the 
finished product isn’t as polished 
as we would like it. There is a clear 
vision for us of what “GLITCHED” 
is and are trying our best to match 
what goes on in game with our 
vision. In the best case, we have 
the game of our dreams work-
ing exactly as we want it and are 
able to release something we are 
really proud of. I think fitting the 
things we want to into this game 
is a problem. Knowing what makes 
the cut into the game is definitely 
something I’m constantly worried 
about.

What are some of the things 

you love about making indepen-
dent games?

I think the freedom of creation 

is the biggest thing. “GLITCHED” 
will always be directly from us. As 
gamers, we always thought, “Man, 
I don’t like this feature” or “imag-
ine if this was done this way.” Hav-
ing the freedom to take risks and 
being able to try out things on our 
own time is really nice.

GLITCHED: How three students 
used Kickstarter to fund a dream

Undergrads at DePaul raised almost $70,000 for their role-playing game

 The most interesting quality 
of Green Day’s newest music 
video, “Still Breathing,” comes 
in the form of Billie Joe Arm-
strong’s fluffy pompadour blow-
ing in the wind. 
 Not a band known to shy away 
from punk rock angst, Green 
Day wholeheartedly delivers in 
making sure “Still Breathing” 
fully packs an emotional punch 
but fails to bring anything else 
to the table. While the song 
itself is originally appealing in 
its vulnerability, it begins to 
loose its charm as the minutes 
tick by. Through lyrics stock-
piled with repetitive clichés 
and laden with a heaviness that 
drags the entire song down, 
“Still Breathing” strives at an 
emotional connection but falls 

flat. 
 This flatness 
is reflected in 
the music video. 
Uniform and 
predictable, 
with scenes that 
detail exactly what the corre-
sponding lyrics are describing 
interjected with several random 
forest scenes that only serve to 
add a layer of confusion over a 
monotonous series of images 
like glossy paint over cracking 
wood. The most frustrating 
thing is that the music video 
itself is beautifully shot. Open-
ing on a picturesque sunrise 
overlooking a set of mountains 
in the distance, “Still Breathing” 
establishes its vivid imagery and 
then continues to build intricate 

stories through 
layers of muted 
tones and pro-
longed shots 
of Armstrong 
looking dra-
matically over 

one shoulder (eyeliner as strong 
as ever). 
 However, while the ways 
scenes are shot add a much-
needed level of depth to the 
music video, the actual scenes 
themselves are mundane 
enough to slip across the screen 
with an unremarkable finality. 
After viewing “Still Breath-
ing,” one is left feeling strangely 
empty, irrevocably trying to 
search for a complexity that just 
isn’t there.

Green Day

4B — Thursday, November 10, 2016
the b-side
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Monarchy is fascinating. Its 

storied history boasts wars, 
incest, opulence and scandal. 
Without 
royalty, 
much 
(if 

not all) of the 
world, which we 
presently 
know, 

would not exist. 
Therefore, it is 
a 
topic 
which 

has 
interested 

scholars, 
filmmakers 
and writers for 
centuries. 
More 

often than not, 
however, 
the 

stories of royalty told are less 
modern, and more historical. 

Though it is not necessarily 

modern, Netflix’s latest period 
drama “The Crown” examines a 
more recent history of the life of 
the English royal family. In this 
series, the relatively secret past 
of England’s Queen Elizabeth is 
unearthed. Beginning in 1947 
at a pivotal point in her life — 
the wedding to Phillip, Duke of 
Edinburgh — it takes viewers on 
a biographical journey through 
the Queen’s past. This high-
budget foray into historical 
drama is a new leap for Netflix, 
but it is, by most accounts, a 
complete success.

Queen Elizabeth, portrayed 

by the dynamic and talented 
Claire Foy (“Wolf Hall”), is 
undeniably 
an 
interesting 

figure to create a biographical 
drama around. She has ruled 
for over 50 years, through 

both trying and prosperous 
times. Her legend will be told 
in history books for years to 
come. Despite her prominence, 
however, there is the question 
of what makes her story so 
compelling. What about the life 
of Queen Elizabeth is worth 

devoting a 10-part 
series 
and 
over 

$100 million to?

As 
the 
pilot 

episode 
takes 

shape, it becomes 
clear 
that 
it’s 

not 
the 
life 
of 

Queen 
Elizabeth 

which makes her 
so 
compelling, 

but 
rather 
the 

persona. 
The 

monarchy, historically, is an 
institution that does not often 
give power to women. Yet 
simply because of her noble 
birth, Elizabeth was the face 
of not only England, but all 
of the countries and regions 
ruled by the Crown. 1947 was 
a time when most women 
were expected to be wives 
and daughters. Very few were 
asked to be leaders. That’s what 
makes Elizabeth so special, and 
what makes “The Crown” a 
worthwhile show. It celebrates 
a strong, powerful woman for 
her achievements and tells her 
story.

On 
the 
note 
of 
power, 

however, it is clear that though 
power 
is 
what 
Elizabeth 

deserves, it is not what she 
always receives. One of the 
most interesting points of the 
pilot episode is during her 
wedding, when she recites her 

vows. To Phillip (Matt Smith, 
“Doctor Who”), she promises 
“to love and cherish and obey.” 
The struggle of sharing power 
is a vital theme throughout 
the show, specifically in the 
marriage 
of 
Elizabeth 
and 

Phillip. How does a Queen obey 
her husband when an entire 
country and its commonwealth 
kingdoms are supposed to obey 
her?

Therein 
the 
first 
major 

question of the series is posed. 
Even though Queen Elizabeth 
is powerful, is she strong? 
Will she stand up for herself or 
comply to societal norms of the 
time, and bow to the will of her 
husband? This is a dichotomy 
which would only face the 
royal family, and it’s thrilling to 
experience it with them.

“The Crown” is a show about 

the transition of a naïve young 
woman into a refined Queen. 
It examines what it means to 
be born into a role where one 
is always being watched and, 
more importantly, a role where 
every action, every reaction and 
every decision must (or should) 
reflect the values of the Crown. 
What 
makes 
“The 
Crown” 

so powerful is the ability to 
experience these characters — 
actual, prominent leaders — as 
they live in these roles. History 
can tell us what happened, but it 
cannot show us how it affected 
them on a humanistic level. An 
inside look into the humanity 
of England’s most composed 
and dignified family is a treat 
for viewers, and well worth the 
watch.
