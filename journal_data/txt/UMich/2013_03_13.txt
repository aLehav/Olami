List names School
of Social Work
as best in nation
By IAN DILLINGHAM
DailyStaffReporter
The University's various
graduate programs have once
again received high marks in
the 2014 U.S. News & World
Report Best Graduate Schools
Rankings, a widely-read pub-

lication.
The University's Medical, Law
and Education Schools all moved
up one spot in overall rankings
from last year and improved in
several specialty areas. The Engi-
neering and Business Schools
both moved down a rank, but
stayed in the top 15 in their
respective categories.
The Ross School of Busi-
ness graduate programs moved
down from 13th to 14th, shar-
ing the position with the
University of California, Los

Angeles. Harvard University
and Stanford University tied
for first place in the business
school category.
The University ranked first in
higher-education administra-
tion and second in secondary-
teacher education. The School
of Social Work was also ranked
number one in the nation, tying
for first with Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis.
The School of Information
achieved strong rankings with
the information systems and

archives and preservation pro-
grams rating number one in
their divisions.
Within engineering special-
ties, the University ranked sec-
ond in both nuclear engineering
and industrial manufacturing
and systems engineering.
University spokesman Rick

is pleased with the rankings,

should rely on other factors as

* 'U' to launch
fourth capital
* campaign

Follows successful
2004 to 2008
fundraising effort
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily News Editor
As state support for the Uni-
versity continues to decline as
an overall portion of the Uni-
versity's budget, campus lead-
ers are gearing up for the next
major fundraising push.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily last month,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said the to-be-named
fundraising campaign would
launch in November of this
year with no definite end date
decided yet. The University has
not yet released a target goal or
some of the exact projects that
they hope to finance through
the multi-billion dollar effort.
However, the general theme
of the campaign will shift
significantly from the brick-
and-mortar focus of previous
fundraisingdrives.
"This particular campaign
will be focused more than the

last campaign was on people
and programs and less focused
on buildings, though there will
be some buildings, I'm sure,
because some of our donors are
interested in helping us solve
some of our problems with
buildings and facilities. It will
be a combination," Coleman
said. "From our standpoint, we
really do want this financial
aid piece to be dominant in the
campaign."
The University has had three
capital campaigns since 1981.
The capital campaign of the
last decade, the Michigan Dif-
ference, ran from 2004 to 2008
and raised $3.2 billion for the
University. Funds were used in
large part to renovate or add to
the University's physical foot-
print through the construction
of 22 new campus buildings,
including the Ross School of
Business, the Ford School of
Public Policy's Weill Hall, C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital and
Von Voigtlander Women's Hos-
pital.

The wheels on the Blue
Buses went round and round
Monday - straight into trou-
ble.
Three University buses
were involved in accidents
Monday, a figure that Keith
Johnson, associate director
of transportation operations,
said is very unusual. Two
of the accidents reportedly
resulted in victim injuries.
While Johnson didn't have
specific statistics, he said
even one incident a week
would be considered too fre-
quent.
Johnson added that per
University protocol, all three
accidents are still under inves-
tigation separately.

HAZING GONE WRONG
Florida A&M alums charged

FHOW TO BE GAY

Twelve former Florida A&M
students were charged with nec-
onod-degree manslaughter in the
murder of Robert Champion, The
Famuan reported March 6.
Ten of the Florida A&M alum-
ni were previously charged with
third-degree felony hazing for
the drum major's 2011ldeath, until
fhe Ninth Circuit State Attorney's
Office decided to increase the
charges earlier in the week.
W. Craig Lawson, an attorney
for one of the defendants, said the
increased charges might be the
result of two other defendants'
guilty pleas and the bargains they
struck with the State Attorney's
Office. The two defendants have
been charged but have not yet

been arrested.
"We were tryingto work some-
thing out on the hazing charge,"
Lawson said. "Now that my cli-
ent charges went from facing five
years to 15 years, I'm not happy
with the situation, but it's within
the state attorney's office to do
that."
University of Colorado takes
measuresato avoid campus 4/20
celebration
Despite Colorado's 2012 deci-
sion to legalize marijuana, the
University of Colorado, Boulder,
is taking measures to prevent
on-campus celebrations of the
counterculture holiday on April

20, the CU Independent reported
Monday.
Last year, potent fertilizer waa
spread on the campus's Norlin
Quad to prevent students from
celebrating the so-called pot
holiday, but this year the area will
instead be off limits. Students
will not be allowed access to the
Quad, and police officers will be
present to ensure "unauthorized
non-affiliates" are not on campus.
The University of Colorado
Student Government said in a
statement they agree with the
administration that 4/20 should
not be celebrated on campus
because it's disruptive and causes
safety concerns, but disagreed
with the tactics used last year.

CAMPAIGN
From Page 1A
nearly 2,000 new scholarships.
Although donations have
peaked during campaign times,
there has been a general rise
in annual contributions during
years following the campaigns
compared to pre-campaign levels.
The record for a single year was in
2008 - the last year of the Michi-
gan Difference campaign - with
$342 million raised.
Coleman said the normal cycle
for fundraising campaigns is usu-
ally five to six years.
"If you look over time at uni-
versities, what you'll find is a
rhythm," Coleman said. "It's not
that you're not raising money.
You're always raising money.
We're on the right rhythm."
One of the main organiza-
tions involved with planning and
coordinating events and pushes
for the campaign will be the Uni-
versity's Office of Development,
which oversees the creation and
sustaining of relationships with
donors and alumni. The upcom-
ing effort will be spearheaded
by Jerry May, University vice
president for development. May
also led the successful Michigan
Difference campaign of the last
decade.
May said last week that the
office of Development has been
working closely with faculty from
across the University to target
priority areas for advancing edu-
cational opportunities.
"The deans of the University
have worked for the last two years
on a strategic planning process
for where they want the Univer-
sity to go over the next five to 10
years," May said. "What are the
academic innovations? What are
the academic priorities that will
make us a stronger, better and
particularly a more relevant edu-
cational institution?"
He added that 38 different sec-
tors of the University are involved
in the planning process - each
with their own priorities and
goals for the upcoming campaign.
However, each of these units is
working with the Office of Devel-
opment to find the most effective
waysofmaximizingcontributions
from donors while maintaining
long-term relationships.
Judy Malcolm, the Office of
Development's senior director of
executive communications, added
that matching donors' interests
with complementary areas within
the University would continue to
be apriorityduringthe campaign.
"The endowment always
increases in campaigns - raising
money for the endowment is an
important part of all campaigns,"
Malcolm said. "When you put
money in the endowment, you
are guaranteeing the future long-
term health of the University."
In the last campaign, donors
contributed $923 million toward
the endowment out of $3.2 billion
raised overall. Malcolm said the
endowment contributions were
earmarked primarily for profes-
sorships and scholarships. It is
unclear whether the endowment
contribution as a portion of over-
all funds raised will increase in
the campaign launching this year
giventhe increased focus onthese

categories.
5 The University is also planning
a kick-off event for the campaign
to motivate donors and students,
but Malcolm said plans have not
yet been finalized.
"We need to fashion this in a
way donors can get excited about
the difference they can make in
people's lives so a lot of this will
be storytelling about what stu-
dents have done and what the
impact of having various schol-
arships has been," Coleman said.
"We need to describe for people
what the need is. They don't nec-
essarily understand our unmet
need, particularly for out-of-
state students, we can't be need-
blind."
In an interview last week, Uni-
versity Provost Philip Hanlon
said endowment funds are almost
entirely "designated" and not eas-
ily used to cover general expenses
for the University. Most proceeds
from endowment contributions
are narrowly limited to the use
designated by the original con-
tributor.
Hanlon echoed Coleman by
saying the University would split
its funds among scholarships,
programs and buildings like the
previous campaign, but it would
refocus on the former for the
upcoming fundraising cycle.

ist was to ensure that diverse
personalities were brought to
perform on campus.
"Last year everyone really
seemed to like J. Cole," Zup-
more said. "(We felt that)
this year students would
want to see something dif-
ferent."
Though the commit-
tee initially hoped to send
out a survey to the student
body as a way to gauge stu-
dent preferences, Zupmore
said time constraints made
this difficult. However, she
believed that the diversity
of representatives on the
decision-making commit-
tee ensured that they would
adequately reflect student

interest.
The University's chapter of
Hillel will be a major spon-
sor of the MUSIC Matters
concert. Dalia Adler, chair of
Hillel, wrote in an email that
collaboration with MUSIC
Matters was in line with the
group's goal to increase their
involvement with the arts on
campus.
Adler emphasized that
bringing together University
students for the collabora-
tive event would be "both an
honor and at the crux of Hil-
lel's values."
"MUSIC Matters united
Michigan in such a unique
and inspiring way," Adler
wrote.
Tickets for the event go
on sale at 11 a.m. Friday at
the Michigan Union Ticket
Office. Prices start at $20.

Pierpont Barnes & Noble
renovated after new lease

Aesthetic
renovations to be
completed by end of
winter semester
ByAMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily StaffReporter
What is now broken walls
and chipped tiles will soon be a
newly renovated North Campus
bookstore.
By the end of the semester,
the Barnes & Noble store housed
in Pierpont Commons will have
undergone aesthetic renova-
tions, including new tiling and
carpets. The layout of the store
will also be altered with text-
book materials moved to the
back wall of the store and school
supplies will move to the front.
The bookstore started pub-
licizing the changes to its on-
campus location through its
Facebook page last Monday.

Pictures of renovations includ-
ed outstripped wallpaper and
shelves and the addition of new
flooring and an information
desk.
When Barnes & Noble's leas-
ing contract expired this year at
Pierpont Commons, a renewed
five-year lease included nego-
tiations to renew the look of the
bookstore. Michael Swanigan,
director of Pierpont Commons,
said the renewed contract came
to fruition when Barnes & Noble
and University Unions exam-
ined their relationship and real-
ized it was mutually beneficial
to renew the lease.
Swanigan believes the cur-
rent construction has not dimin-
ished the store's supply, and
students will not be affected by
the renovations. He added that
the store operations will con-
tinue uninterrupted during the
renovations.
Last March, Michigan Book
& Supply announced they would
close down their location on

the intersection of South State
Street and North University
Avenue. Its owner, Nebraska
Book Company, cited reasons
that included its inability to
compete with on-campus book-
store Barnes & Noble. The store
was one of the only area stores
that sells art supplies.
"With the closing of Michi-
gan Book & Supply, we knew
there was a request for more
art supplies," Swanigan said.
"(Barnes & Noble) has certainly
been working with the School
of Art & Design to bringin more
of the supplies that they need-
ed."
Despite the changes that will
take place, Swanigan said that
the renovations will be orga-
nizational and won't affect the
bookstore's display or storage
space.
"This renovation is only to
relocate some things and change
the layout," Swanigan said. "We
hope it will better serve the
community."


RANKED
From Page 1A
sity they want to attend.
"(U.S. News) is perhaps
the most widely recognized
ranking of U.S. universities,"
Fitzgerald said. "We know
that there are lots of people
who pay attention to the rank-
ings, but I would just under-
score that it's one piece of
information. It takes much
more than just looking at the
rankings to decide what's the
best place for you."
The University's Medical
School retained its position in
eighth place for primary care
and moved up two spots - from
10th to eighth - in research
medicine. University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill ranked
first in primary care, while
Harvard University topped the
list for research medicine.
Medical School Dean
James Woolliscroft said he
rarely pays much attention to
the rankings, instead prefer-
ring to focus on how students
of the Medical School perform
after graduation.
"In general, the U.S. News
rankings are rankings that
I don't pay much attention

to with one exception ... the
assessment score by residency
directors of our medical stu-
dent graduates," Woolliscroft
said. "I look at ... how we've
done, how our students are
viewed by the program direc-
tors they will be going to in the
next step of their training."
Woolliscroft said alumni of
the Medical School tend to fare
very well in their various posi-
tions.
"As residency positions
have become ever more com-
petitive, we pay a great deal of
attention to how our students
are doing nationally," Wool-
liscroft said. "I'm very pleased
that we continued to be in a
tie for second place as to how
our students who graduate are
viewed by program directors."
Woolliscroft also encour-
aged students to look beyond
rankings when choosing the
best medical school, citing a
school's environment, faculty
and current students as other
important factors.
"Obviously they've already
looked at things like academic
stature," Woolliscroft said. "It
really comes down to how they
see themselves really meeting
their aspirations at that par-
ticular school."


PALS
From Page 1A
idea of what a "day in the life of
a Wolverine" is like. Organizers
employ University students as
tour guides and role models for
younger students in hopes that
the kids leave inspired and see-
ing a pursuit in a higher educa-
tion as an achievable goal.
Tuesday's activities included
a chemistry demonstration, a
visit to the Planetarium, a meet-
and-greet session with student
athletes, lunch at South Quad,
a museum tour and a variety
show.
Education senior Amanda
Webster, started working with
K-grams during her freshman
year and is now the executive
director.
"I had always wanted to be
a teacher," Webster said. She
taught dance in high school and
signed up to be a pen pal early
her freshman year.
The pen pal program matches
more than 1,000 University stu-
dents with students from nine
elementary schools in South-
eastern Michigan to exchange

letters on a monthly basis.
Webster continued her
involvement with K-grams
through the BookMARK pro-
gram during her sophomore
year because it allowed her to
stay active with the program
even though she was not liv-
ing in University housing. Most
K-grams programs require par-
ticipants to live in the residence
halls.
BookMARK arranges for
University students to visit an
elementary school once a week,
either for one-on-one or group
mentoring and reading activi-
ties.
Education senior Natalie Voss
worked as a student leader for
K-day. She said her favorite part
about the program is seeing the
kids, who wouldn't have much
interest in writing otherwise,
put so much effort into letters
for their pen pals.
"They really put time into
making (the letters) their best
work," Voss said.
Jasmine, a Willow Run stu-
dent, said her encounter with
a member of the track team on
K-day got her thinking about
running track if she ends up at

the University. Another student,
Zeke, said his favorite part about
the tour was the planetarium.
LSA sophomore Katherine
Wolf has been Zeke's pen pal
since she joined K-grams in Sep-
tember. They met at Tuesday's
K-day and said it was fun to
bond over South Quad's grilled
cheese sandwiches.
"All my pen pals want to be
doctors," Zeke said.
In fact, Wolf wants to be a
pediatrician. "This is a good
experience in communicating
with someone younger than
me," she said.
LSA senior Sydney Behrmann
said she has always enjoyed
working with kids and finds
being a pen pal a fun break
from regular campus life. She
got involved during her fresh-
man year, and although she was
unable to be a pen pal last year
while living off-campus, she's
happy that being a residential
adviser this year has allowed
her to resume her work with
K-grams.
"Getting the letters is so
much fun," she said. "It's great
to see someone really look up to
you."


BUSES
From Page 1A
"Each accident is evalu-
ated on an individual basis
to assess what the situa-
tion and the severity was,"
he said. "We also examine
whether or not it was a pre-
ventable or a non-prevent-
able situation and respond
accordingly."
Johnson explained that
an action review commit-
tee, consisting of a for-
mally appointed supervisor
and a representative from
Risk Management Services,
exists in order to debrief
with the drivers after
they've been involved in an
accident. He said the penal-
ties faced, if any, depend on
the severity of the situation
and if any damage or injuries
occurred.
One of Monday's acci-
dents, which was reported
to police and logged as a "hit
and run," is being reconsid-
ered after an investigation
gave University authorities
reason to believe that this
was not the case.
"After what we've investi-
gated so far, we have reason
to believe it was not a hit and
run, but a miscommunication
between the two drivers,"
Johnson said. "Because of the
location of the accident, the
(bus) driver couldn't stop and
was going to a more appropri-
ate location."
Johnson also said he
couldn't think of a good rea-
son why a University bus driv-
er would commit a hit and run
as opposed to dealing with the
incident.
Although University bus-
driving positions are posted
publicly, applicants undergo
a thorough hiring process to
ensure they know the rules of
the road. Johnson said drivers
are formally trained and edu-
cated as commercial drivers
before they're hired to drive
the big Blue Buses.
University Police spokes-
woman Diane Brown said
the incidents were unrelat-
ed. While witnesses allege
that one accident resulted
in a woman having a seizure

and being taken away by
ambulance, Brown could not
comment on victim medical
status.
LSA sophomore Catherine
Culkin, who was hit by a
blue bus Monday while rid-
ing her bike on Hill Street,
said in an e-mail interview
that the bus hit her as it was
turning onto Greene Street
from Hill Street. Culkin
said the police found the bus
driver at fault.
"It looked like the driver
was stopping; much to my dis-
may, I guess he just didn't see
me," Culkin said.
Though she initially told
police she was uninjured as
a result of the incident, her
body was very sore when
she woke up the next morn-
ing. Culkin has contacted
Risk Management Services
to request reimbursement
for damage sustained by her
bike.
LSA junior James Kehoe
has been a University bus
driver since May 2011.
"I've always liked driving
so this is basically the perfect
job for me," Kehoe said. "It
pays well and it's getting me
through school, even if it is a
little crazy sometimes."
Two months into his
career as a Blue Bus driver,
he got into an accident driv-
ing a bus, which he said "hap-
pens to everyone at some
point."
"I was pulling out of a
(bus) stop and hit another
car," Kehoe said. "I followed
all of the procedures and
because the damages weren't
over $1,000 I didn't get a
ticket."
Kehoe added that his
meeting with the Action
Review Committee was
helpful, as the committee
members were encouraging
but explained that it was a
"preventable, accident." The
committee also explained
how to avoid accidents in the
future.
While Kehoe didn't know
the specifics of any of the
events from this week, he
said, in his experience, winter
weather often contributes to
an increase in the number and
severity of accidents.

Essential expansion
Michigan Republicans should follow Gov. Snyder's lead and expand Medicaid
n March 11 the Michigan Health and Hospital Association
released their annual report, which paints a grim picture
of the current financial state of many Michigan health-care
facilities. According to the report, hospitals in Michigan spent an
excess of $1.8 billion on health care for patients who were unable to
pay for these services in 2011. Of these expenses, $868 million were
incurred as a result of unreimbursed Medicare and Medicaid ser-
vices. To address these massive fiscal shortfalls, the report calls on
Michigan politicians to expand Medicaid coverage and implement
a health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care and Patient
Protection Act. From both a financial and social standpoint, Michi-
gan needs to adopt these expansion policies in order to be a national
leader in accessible and high quality health care.

To our brave men and women
fighting overseas to protect
our freedoms, we salute you.
All of you are
true American
heroes, and
our democracy
would not be
possible without
your sacrifices.
And we do
salute them. It ANDREW
seems as if at
every sporting ECKHOUS
event, political
rally and every
other chance we get, we pay trib-
ute to our countrymen in uniform
around the globe. It's nothing more
than a gesture from the protected to
the protectors, an outpouring of grat-
itude for all for our inalienable rights,
like $9.75 ballpark beers and the
endless onslaught of Adam Sandler
comedies. All in all, it's just another
harmless affirmation that we are on
the side of right, regardless of what is
actually happening abroad.
But are we to assume that each
and every soldier is a hero? Must I
believe that onlythe noblest Ameri-
cans enlist in the military and tote
machine guns through the deserts
of far-off countries? Absolutely not.
I don't believe that all soldiers
are heroes. When a person enlists
in acombat position, it doesn't auto-
matically bequeath upon them the
title of "hero." Rather, it puts the
onus on that man or woman to be an
exemplary human being, especially
to make up for the fact that their job
may be to kill. Though a soldier's
job can involve killing and maim-
ing, the idealistic American public
prefers the image of them building
houses and handing out candy bars
- in other words, Norman Rock-
well's Afghanistan.
If I sound a bit disenchanted,
that's because Iam. Questioning the

government or anyone employed by
it seemed unnecessary when I was
younger. We're the United States;
we're the best, right? Unfortunately,
as my knowledge of American his-
tory grew, so did my doubt. I learned
about mass killings of Native Ameri-
cans, American-backed dictators in
South America and the murder of
civilians in Vietnam. These affronts
to humanity, coupled with the inter-
national condemnation of America's
Iraq War policies, created an atmo-
sphere where my preconceptions
violently collided with reality.
Then, last year, I watched an ex-
Marine's account of the atrocities he
committed during his time in Iraq.
From shooting an innocent man "in
front of his friend and his father" and
watching his family drag him away,
to soldiers being promised extra time
off by their superiors if they were the
first to stab a man to death, the video
shocked and disillusioned me. If even
our soldiers - supposedly heroic citi-
zens - were capable of acts such as
these,whatdidthat say abouttherest
of our citizenry?
Starting on that day I began to
cringe whenever I heard a politician
whoop the crowd into a quiet frenzy
with his tribute to "our heroes over-
seas." The former rote cheering and
muscle memory clapping came a
little slower now, and blindly label-
ing all American soldiers "heroic"
started to seem irresponsible to me.
But for those who think this
makes me a turncoat or a traitor,
you are wrong. I hold my country
to a higher standard - as we all
should - and I'm a strong believer
in what America can stand for. It
seems patriotism and American
exceptionalism have become paro-
dies of themselves. But they remain
a part of our country's ethos and we
have a duty to be the best we can be.
What does that mean for our for-
eign policy? Nothing, except that

when our politicians send Ameri-
can boys into a foreign country,
whether for legitimate reasons or
not, we cannot allow leniency for
gross transgressions.
When a soldier kills
a man in front of his
friend and father, it
is not heroic.
When a soldier kills 16 Afghanis
in a drunken rampage, he is not a
hero. And when a soldier kills an
innocent man in front of his friend
and his father, he is not a hero, even
if he later apologizes for it.
Heroic soldiers exist, and I like to
think that they make up the majority
of our armed forces. There are men
who die protecting innocent people,
both Americans and not. There are
men who improve the lives of people
around the world. And there are
men that believe so deeply in the val-
ues and ideals immortalized in our
Constitution that they are willingto
die for them.
I'm thankful that Ilive in a coun-
try where I can voice these opinions
publicly without fear of persecu-
tion, and I know much of that comes
from the sacrifices of our soldiers.
But we must hold them to the same
standards as every other Ameri-
can. We can respect and salute our
soldiers and military, but we must
be cognizant of their actions at all
times. When someone has a gun and
unfettered protection, their actions
resound even more loudly - for bet-
ter or for worse.

Nationwide, the standard of health-care
coverage is changing. Despite a federal com-
mitment to more extensive coverage under
the ACA, individual hospitals currently
assume responsibility for the care of millions
of Americans through charitable services.
While Michigan's hospitals remain dedicated
to providing assistance regardless of income,
trade associations like the MHA continue to
assert that the underfunding of these servic-
es detracts from their main goal: to provide
quality care to improve the standards of living
of not just individuals, but also communities.
Currently, 1.2 million Michigan residents
are uninsured. As proposed, the Medic-
aid expansion would provide health care to
an estimated 450,000 additional Michigan
adults. Much of the aid provided to uninsured
patients is through emergency room services
and other non-proactive health care solu-
tions that are more expensive and less effec-
tive than periodic care. Estimates from both
the Republican-led House and Senate Fiscal
Agencies project that the state will save $1
billion over a decade as the federal govern-
ment's assistance covers these costs in addi-
tion to the $2 billion annual federal funds for
the expansion.
Some Republican lawmakers and opponents

of the ACA are concerned about the long-term
costs associated with the program, arguing
that Michigan will eventually be financially
responsible for a percentage of the proposed
expansion. After three years, 10 percent of
expansion costs are to be covered by the state,
while the other 90 percent will continue to
be federally funded. From both an economic
and social perspective, however, the costs of
not implementing a Medicaid expansion far
outweigh the costs of those future payments.
As health care is Michigan's leading employer
in the private sector, the deterioration of this
critical component of the job market could
have devastating effects for a state economy
already in a slow recovery.
Expanding Medicaid coverage in Michigan
under the-ACA will have significant financial
and social benefits for Michigan hospitals,
residents and communities as well. Ultimately,
however, improvements in community health
can't be achieved solely through retroactive
treatment. A responsible policy toward health
care will place equal emphasis on both sides
of health care: the proactive measures and the
reactive measures. State politicians must step
up to help Michigan strengthen its position as
a national leader in the health care industry
and expand Medicaid coverage.

Devices or vices?

Across campus, we walk around with our
cell phones in our hands and headphones on
our ears. In our cafes and dining halls, we like
to pretend that we're not alone when dining
solo so we keep our cell phones and comput-
ers on the table, ignoring the restaurant filled
with people.
Ironically, the rise of social media has made
self-induced alienation even easier, and we
often don't realize how ridiculous it makes us
look. We don't hear our friends calling to us
because our ear buds clog our ear canals. We
don't notice a trashcan in our path because our
eyes are hyper-focused on our text message. We
talk to the air because our cell phones have put
voices in our heads. Not only are we becoming
more antisocial, we're also becoming ignorant
and desensitized to the beauty beyond our LED
screens. The prizes, tools and social lubricants
of Generation 2.0 provide us with many advan-
tages that I, for one, am happy to enjoy in mod-
eration. Life moves pretty fast. If you don't look
up from your text and take off your headphones
every once in a while, you could wander past
heavenly Aphrodite and into cross-town traffic.
Students sleepwalking around campus is just
one example of social media and mobile tech-
nology blocking out the rest of our worlds. We
see similar examples everywhere. People text
while driving, pooping and hooking up. Peo-
ple social network during real conversations,
parties and adventures. They're all distract-
ing from the main task at hand. Multitasking
is an illusion. We merely divide our attention
between our different tasks. For the grow-
ing ADHD community, that attention span is
already stressed. But really, this message is for
all of us: We can only naturally do one thing at
once, yet we go against our nature and stress
our minds beyond their capabilities. I'm all for
pressing the limits and bounds of one's brain to
expand its power, but when we repeatedly fail,
as we have with multitasking, we must reassess.
In the stream-anywhere media world of
today, we've become accustomed to a constant
source of external stimulation. We've already
observed how we love to go everywhere per-
petually plugged in. However, even when we go
nowhere - when we first wake up in the morn-
ing, for example - we can satisfy our appetite
for stimulation just by grabbing our cell phones
or computers. We can work, socialize and play,
all from the comfort of our beds. So why leave?
If a life can be lived without actual human con-

tact, why not live that life? It would certainly be
more comfortable and convenient.
I think we choose not to because we strive
for human contact. We desire real relation-
ships based on face-to-face interactions.
Every other social medium (texting, Face-
book messaging, tweeting, etc.) is just an
insufficient substitution trying to imitate real
human interactions and failing to capture
their virtue. Real conversations and real rela-
tionships can be stressful, uncomfortable and
problematic, but they're getting even harder
because Generation 2.0 has learned to social-
ize largely through social media and has con-
sequently become socially inept.
Are we just lazy? Do we fear real relation-
ships? Are we reflecting on our behavior and
aiming to improve ourselves, or are we satis-
fied with what we're doing because society
considers it normal? So what then? You're
afraid of getting a little weird? Shame on you.
To concede, there are plenty of reasons to
alienate one's self from the world. It can be
an ugly, disgusting place. I mean look at it -
it's filled with rape, murder and disease. So if
we're thinking about reasons to drop out of
society, there are plenty that you could find
convincing. But I don't think many of us are
really thinking about what we're doing. We're
creatures of habit. But if you decide to think
about it, you'll probably realize that escaping
the world's ugliness and evil through elec-
tronics does not prove very successful. I've
found-it tends to be the opposite, because the
media loves to focus on the evil and ugly.
Lastly, understand that your world, your
life, in all that is excellent and mundane, is
beautiful. Pay more attention to the natu-
ral beauty, even the everyday beauty we see
walking to class like the hot dog stand, the
Chemistry Building, the squirrel, the cof-
fee cup. Yes, it is the little things. Wake up!
Tune into them. Please turn off your cellu-
lar devices and drop back into the non-cyber
world. If we're always listening to our music,
we're missing the opportunity to truly listen
and interact. Assess your habits. Are your
devices becoming your vices? Are you doing
what you're doing deliberately? Or are you
just a lemming nearing the edge of the cliff?
Listen - is that the sound of oncoming traffic
headed your way? Wake up. Look out.

Since his death on March 5, many
have called Venezuela's president,
Hugo Chavez, agreat and revolution-
ary leader, a hero and a champion of
the poor. His supporters have raised
him to the status of a god it seems,
with a ridiculously over-the-top
funeral and plans to embalmhisbody
and place it in a museum. The after-
math of Chavez's death has caused
Venezuela to gain quite a bit of atten-
tion as people look back at what his
impact as president was on the oil-
rich South American country.
As someone who was born in
Caracas, Venezuela's capital, I've
witnessed the great effect that
Chavez has had on my country. I
moved from Venezuela to the Unit-
ed States at a very young age. But,
since most of our family was still in
Caracas, my mother would take my
sister and me to visit as often as pos-
sible. We were always there for our
birthdays, our relatives' birthdays,
holidays, etc. It was the closest to
growing up in Venezuela as we could
get. But then the visits stopped. It
was six years before we went back
to Venezuela and, at the time, being
only about 12 years old, I didn't
really understand why. I asked my
parents why we weren't going any-
more, and they said it had to do with
the political situation but that they
couldn't explain it to me because I
was too young. I didn't really ques-
tion it, and I was just excited that we
were going back after so many years.
My earliest memories from those
visits were of Caracas's beautiful
scenery. I remember how I used to
dream of going to the tops of the
immense mountains surrounding
the city so that I could catch a cloud.
When I went back after those six
years, I was shocked. Many of the
hills and mountainsides that I had
remembered as being so beautiful
were covered in irregularly shaped
colored boxes. I asked my mom what
they were, and she explained to me
that those weren't boxes, but houses
for the poor. After that visit, a few
more years passed before we went
back. Again, my parents mentioned
the political situation and the inse-
curity, warning my sister and me to

use only our Venezuelan passports
and to speak only in Spanish.
By then, I had a slightly better
understanding of Chavez and what
was going on in the country, but the
reality of the situation hadn't hit me
yet. On our way to my grandpar-
ents' house, I again saw the boxes
on the sides of mountains, but they
seemed to have grown exponen-
tially this time. I mentioned to my
mom that there hadn't been that
many the last time we were there,
and she shook her head sadly, say-
ing, "Gracias a Chavez" - 'Thanks
to Chavez.' A few days later, on our
way back from a mall, we got stuck
in the horror that is Caracas traffic.
The really terrifying thing, though,
wasn't the cars blatantly disregard-
ing lanes and the seeming millions
of reckless drivers; it was the row of
soldiers standing along the side of
the highway, guns pointed straight
at my window.
More years passed between that
visit and my last one, which was two
summers ago for my cousin's wed-
ding. During that time, I was able to
come to a much better understand-
ing of the situation in Venezuela.
Chavez had completely taken over
Venezuela and turned it into a pov-
erty-ridden, semi-military, semi-
personalistic dictatorship, disguised
as a democracy.
How did he do this? By appealing
to the poor, of course. By relying on
the ignorance of the population to
secure loyal followers while actu-
ally worsening Venezuela's situation.
Poverty had spread to every corner
of Caracas, and that was nothing
compared to what was happening
elsewhere in the country: power
outages, food and supply shortages,
kidnappings, killings and robber-
ies. Friends of the family were being
attacked and kidnapped, tied up and
left in their cars while men robbed
their houses, or left for dead on the
side of the road. While Chavez was
preaching how much better Ven-
ezuela had become and his support-
ers blindly accepted every word he
spoke, the reality of the situation
was terrifying. No wonder my par-
ents were so reluctant to visit. The

increasing hatred toward the United
States combined with the already
present dangers in Caracas - it's a
wonder we've been able to visit at all.
After Chavez's death was
announced, my grandparents told
us how people were celebrating in
the streets. The atmosphere in my
house was more somber, as my mom
repeatedly told me that someone's
death should never be the cause for
celebration. Still, Chavez's death
seems to have done more harm to
the anti-Chavistas than good as his
supporters portray him as a savior
and pledge their loyalty to Nicolas
Maduro, his successor. It's truly
incredible how ignorant his follow-
ers can be, not only of how Chavez
worsened Venezuela's situation, but
also of how the government is bla-
tantly throwing the constitution out
the window and taking on a much
more openly oppressive role. While
Chavez was in power, independent
media virtually disappeared. Glo-
bovision was the only remaining
channel that was openly critical of
the government. Now, Globovision
has been bought by a government-
friendly company - so much for
freedom of speech. If that wasn't
enough, the Supreme Tribunal of
Justice declared that Maduroawas to
have the official title of 'president,'
allowing him to run in the presi-
dential elections to be held in April,
which is unconstitutional.
Chavez's followers preach that
he was a great and just leader, and
will blindly support Maduro sim-
ply because Chavez told them to.
The government is slowly but surely
removing its democratic disguise,
while the people refuse to realize
what is happening around them.
There is a small hope that Henrique
Capriles, the candidate representing
the opposition, will beat Maduro in
the elections, but many of us know
how unlikely that situation would be.
Still, this hope - the hope that Ven-
ezuela will finally be able to shake off
the years of Chavismo, hate and vio-
lence - is allwe have left.

Lackluster 'Beast'
needs more spice

Travel Channel's
newest addition
isn't satisfying
By KELLY ETZ
Daily Arts Writer
You've prohably assumed,
while microwaving that third
grilled cheese at 4 a.m., that
there has to be
something bet- C-
ter in the world
of late-night Feed the
eatin'. Beast
Travel Chan-
nel to the res- Wednesdays
cue. "Feed the at 9 p.m.
Beast," a new
six-part series, Travel
chronicles food
"enthusiast"
Mikey Roe's city-hopping quest to
find the holy grail of early morn-
ingeateries.
The premiere, which features
San Francisco's gastronomic
footprint, finds Roe chatting
with the culinary minds behind
a top-secret burrito in Fisher-
man's Wharf. The supersized,
super-stuffed Mexican classic
looks deliciously unhealthy, but
the whole "insider" aspect of the
off-menu order is lost the second
it's revealed, turning a previously
underground option back into a
plain 'ole burrito just in time for
midnight. The rest of the episode
has Roe filling up on deep-fried
peanut butter and jelly, fresh gin-
ger crab and hanging with drag
queens over Portuguese sausage.
Getting up close and personal
withchefs, restaurantowners and
local food columnists, Roe looks
like he's having a blast. But watch-
ing Roe chow his way through a
smorgasbord of stomach-splitting
comfort food? Not so much.
It would've been more fun if
Travel had extended the series,

He takes home seconds in his beard.
with Roe diving into a more
diverse range of cities, instead of
hitting the big-time basics like
NYC, Seattle and Chicago. Why
not get a little grittier and let
viewers in on the best-kept (and
most appetizing) secrets of Provi-
dence, RI., Chattanooga, Tenn. or
hell, even Ann Arbor? Roe getting
down and greasy with the locals is
one of the best parts of the show,
but it would be more exciting if
these were actually hidden-gem-
type places, instead of leaving
half the audience moaning "been
there, ate that."
The travel aspect is practi-
cally nonexistent, making "Feed
the Beast" more like what Food
Network airs when it's not air-
ing "Chopped," a show about
food you'll never make from a
city you've probably already seen.
Unless the next time you mosey
over to San Fran you'll be consult-
ing the list you hastily scrawled
during Roe's endless chomping,
the series is pretty much useless
except as a way for the Travel

Channel to work in more food-
ie-friendly programming sans
Anthony Bourdain.
The 9 p.m. timeslot seems like
a mistake, especially for a series
that claims to know thebest "late-
night" eats. It would fit better,
and will probably end up, in the
dead zone of 3 a.m. television, as
a substitute for all those OxiClean
infomercials. At least in the early
hours of the morning it's easier
to justify watching a show about
late-night eating, instead of actu-
ally having to haul ass off the
futon to hit the Taco Bell drive-
thru.
Even so, this isn't the worst
thing you'll ever see. An ade-
quate alternative if you've
already noshed your way
through every episode of "Top
Chef" ever made, "Feed the
Beast" won't cure the hangover-
induced hunger pains, but it
might distract you from throw-
ing up for a while. What else can
Travel expect after scraping the
bottom of the bland barrel?

When it comes to gadgets, I'm
an early adopter. The thrill of
experiencing a new technology
before it becomes widespread
makes me feel like a pioneer of
sorts, someone riding the wave
of the future. It's fun when you
can give firsthand impressions
to friends contemplating a pur-
chase, and the added attention
gives me an excuse to start dis-
cussing tech with people. But
most people would sagely advise
you to play it safe, to just wait
when it comes to the ever-pro-
gressing, planned-obsolescence-
embracing tech industry. It's not
bad advice either, as early adop-
tion isn't without its problems (or
premiums). But with a little bit of
strategy, and perhaps an adjust-
ment of expectations, there's a
way to satiate the desire for the
"newest thing" while still allow-
ing you to upgrade in the future.
Be prepared to research. For
someone hopelessly addicted to
technology like myself, I want
to ensure that I can upgrade.
Nothing is more frustrating than
purchasing a new device to, only
weeks later, watch the Internet
blow up with news of the next
generation. Sure, you had a lit-
tle slice of the future for a few
months, but now the future has
moved on, leaving you to watch
its advancements in envy. I try to
avoid this scenario, and research
is the answer. More on that later.

they are ready
for the chal-

A good portion of this work
falls on University graduate
James Ingagiola, who stepped
up to play the role of Brick.
Ingagiola is no stranger to the
Ann Arbor theater commu-
nity, having written, directed
and starred in countless shows,
including A2CT's production'
of Shakespeare's "Much Ado

of the Pollits, a dysfunctional,
but very wealthy, Southern fam-
ily. With the aging patriarch, Big
Daddy, dying of cancer, the fam-
ily must deal with its own greed,
lies and inner turmoil or risk
tearing the family apart.
Like most shows, the cast
begins each practice with a
series of warm-ups that include
a mix of vocal exercises as well
as a few simple yoga stretches.
Sometimes, though, Walsh likes
to introduce some elements of
fun into an otherwise very dra-
matic rehearsal.
One such exercise had the
cast performing the entirety of
the show in under an hour using
only their characters' subtext
and staging for the dialogue. The
task allowed the actors to get
crazy, while also letting them
explore their characters' ulte-
rior, and often unsaid, motives.
While the upcoming open-
ing night adds pressure for
the ensemble, they must also
deal with the stress from their
careers outside of the play.
Walsh works for the Office of

University Development and
Anna Heinl, who plays Maggie,
works as an attorney in South-
field, Mich.
"I work and live 45 minutes
away so it's a long commute,
but it's worth it for this amaz-
ing experience with these great
people," Heinl said.
Despite busy schedules, the
actors wouldn't dream of giv-
ing up theater. The passion they
have for the work keeps them
coming back time and again.
"I think what's important is
that you believe in the transfor-
mative power of the arts," Walsh
explained. "You believe in the
questions being asked and you
fight to be on that stage."
Ingagiola, who takes a more
personal view of the arts, added,
"It's the communion of work-
ing with other actors and com-
municating ideas to an audience
which I really enjoy."
When the audience walks
out, Walsh and the cast hope
they leave discussing the story
told and the themes within that
story.
"When a play is asking the
right questions and does the
right job, people don't walk

the inclusion of voting via tex-

If you can honestly tell me S
that you think Lee DeWyze
deserved to win over Crystal
Bowersox in season nine, then I
question your integrity. By any-
body's standards that result was,
quite frankly, ridiculous and
embarrassing for you.
Now, if these guys were all
going on to become successful
recording artists, I would back
off. But David Cook, Kris Allen
and DeWyze were all dropped
from their initial record labels
because they were either ini-
tially successful and then faded
(Cook) or never sold enough

the voting per household or let-
ting the judges have some sort
of say), but I have a good feel-
ing about the girls' chances this
season. There's one girl in par-
ticular that not only could I see
winning this year, but also that
I could see go on to become a
commercial success. And that's
Angie Miller.
She has a voice to be reckoned
with, the looks of a pop star and
the songwriting chops that more
than legitimize her other tal-
ents. And she knows it. She can
win ... I think.
"Idol," I know you're slow-

ever think that, maybe, that's
because of the homogeneity of
your recent winners? You need
a female winner. Badly. Having
a female winner will prove that
your competition hasn't lost its
ability to surprise and that it
isn't just one note.
This season of "Idol" has been
a pleasure to watch so far -
you've reinvented yourself with
captivating new judges, a new
format and a renewed sense of
self. Gone are the days of J.Lo's
coddling, Steven Tyler's aloof-

Poor defense
on minds of
Wolverines

Recently, Michigan
has allowed
opponents to put up
crooked numbers
By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Editor
A trend has been developing
for the Michigan men's basketball
team's defense, and it's not a very
encouraging one.
During the first four months of
the season, the sixth-ranked Wol-
verines (12-6 Big
Ten, 25-6 over- NOTEBOOK
all) were great at
containing individual scoring out-
bursts. In that time period, they
allowed just two opposing play-
ers to break the 20-point barrier
* against them - West Virginia's
Terry Henderson and Minnesota's
Austin Hollins.
But over the course of the past
two weeks, a span stretching four
games, Michigan has allowed an
opposing player to score at least
25 points in three of those games
- and the Wolverines are 1-2 in
those contests.
"Our whole defense has been
a concern," said Michigan coach
John Beilein. "Whether it's offen-
sive rebounds, ball-screen defense

- there's a lot that goes into it.
At one time it was rotations, at
another time it was the big men, at
a different time it was the guards.
Bringing it all together is diffi-
cult."
The discouraging signs on
defense began when Michigan
was upset by Penn State on Feb.
27. Nittany Lions guard Jermaine
Marshall scored 16 of his 25 points
in the final 10 minutes of the game,
helping erase a 15-point deficit en
route to a 84-78 Penn State victory.
That one-man show by Mar-
shall was upped one week later by
Purdue's Terone Johnson. Though
Michigan narrowly defeated the
Boilermakers, 80-75, Johnson
torched the Wolverines for 32
points. The Purdue guard aver-
ages less than 14 points a game,
but he scored bucket after bucket
on his way to dropping 19 second-
half points.
And then against Indiana on
Sunday, Michigan was unable to
limit a one-man show again, as
Cody Zeller dropped 25 points.
The Hoosier big man was too
much for the Wolverines to handle
down the stretch, scoring 16 sec-
ond-half points - six in the final
40 seconds - to help Indiana pull
out a 72-71 come-from-behind vic-
tory.
"There was some lapses in deci-
sion-making and at times in our

minutes a game.
"Our coaches have been push-
ing me all year to just be solid for
us defensively, and what I have
strived to do is just defend and
rebound for this team and do
every little thing that this team
needs from me," Morgan said.
AN ASSISTANT AT LAST:
Beilein has accomplished many
things during his 35-year coach-
ing career, but there's one thing
that has always set him apart
from his coaching colleagues: He's
never been an assistant coach,
anywhere.
But after this summer, that will
be no more. On Tuesday, Beilein
was selected as an assistant coach
for the 2013 USA Basketball Men's
World University Games team,
joining South Carolina coach
Frank Martin as an assistant.
Davidson coach Bob McKillop
will lead the coachingstaff.
"It will be different for me to
hold a clipboard for somebody,
there's no question about itc- I feel
very funny about that - but I'll
hold it for Bob McKillop anytime,"
Beilein said.
An annual event, the 2013
World University Games will be
held July 7-16, in Kazan, Russia.
Beilein has had several oppor-
tunities in the past totake part in
Team USA Basketball, but has had
to turn them down every time. He
had previously been offered dur-
ing situations when he took a new
job and his first obligation was
to the university that he had just
joined. With Michigan holding
steady near the top of the college
basketball world, Beilein thought
this was as good of a time as any to
take the opportunity.
"I love the World University
Games," he said. "You get to work
with college players that are really
there for the right reasons. I get to
work with Bob McKillop, who is a
great friend of mine, and serve the
country most importantly."

execution," said redshirt junior
forward Jordan Morgan.
Whatever the cause is, Beilein
knows that improvement will only
come with ateam effort.
"I don't think it's as much as one
person as it is moving as a unit,"
he said. "It just takes one man to
break down."
TEAM EARNS WE-WARDS:
On Monday, sophomore guard
Trey Burke was named Big Ten
Player of the Year by the coaches
and media, but he wasn't the only
Wolverine to pick up a honor for
his performance during the 2013
conference season.

Junior swingman Tim Hard-
away Jr., freshman forward Glenn
Robinson III and Morgan were all
honored by the Big Ten on Mon-
day, as well.
"It's such a terrific honor for all
of these guys," Beilein said. "It's
incredible to have that type of rep-
resentation."
Hardaway joined Burke as an
All-Big Ten first-team selection
by the coaches, and was placed on
the All-Big Ten second team by the
media. A two-time Big Ten Player
of the Week recipient this season,
Hardaway is averaging a career
high in points (14.8), rebounds

(4.7), assists (2.2) and field-goal
percentage (45.0).
Robinson was honored with a
Big Ten All-Freshman team selec-
tion, marking the third consecu-
tive year a Wolverine has made the
team. After starting all 31 games
for the Wolverines, the freshman

Streaky 'M' prepares for tourney

Which team will
show up at the
NCAA Tournament?
By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Editor
Just days after being bounced
from the Big Ten Tournament,
the Michigan women's basket-
ball team now has its sights set on
loftier goals - an NCAA champi-
onship.
The Wolverines (10-6 Big Ten,
21-10 overall) will likely receive
their sixth tournament berth in
program history Monday under
the leadership of first-year coach
Kim Barnes Arico. At St. John's
University, Barnes Arico led the
Red Storm to four tournament
appearances, including a trip to
the Sweet 16 in 2012.
"I'm excited for the opportu-
nity to play in the NCAA Tour-
nament," Barnes Arico said.
"Obviously it's going to be a
stressful week. We feel like we're
in agood position, and we feel like
our total of body of work has been
really good. We feel like we're one
of the top teams in the country."
Last season, former Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth helped the
Wolverines achieve their only
tournament berth during his five-
year tenure in Ann Arbor. The
Wolverines, however, couldn't
extend their season past the first

round and ended the year with a
loss to Oklahoma.
But that was last year.
Michigan now boasts one of
the best teams in the Big Ten,
carried by a core of five seniors
and a rookie coach. The Wol-
verines have been streaky down
the stretch this season, but it's
their senior class that insists on
making some noise in the NCAA
Tournament.
The question isn't whether
Michigan has the talent to make
a deep run in the dance, but rath-
er if it will show up. This season
has been chock full of impressive
wins, including victories over
Michigan State and eventual con-
ference tournament champion
Purdue on the road.
When the Wolverines are fir-
ing on all cylinders, they have the
potential to beat almost anyone.
Michigan proved its competitive
fight this season with near victo-
ries over two top-10 teams, Duke
and Penn State.
"We could catch somebody off
guard, and we got a lot of differ-
ent weapons, and when we were
playing well, I think we could
beat a lot of good people," Barnes
Arico said.
Yet the Wolverines have also
proven their ability to struggle
against poor teams. Consecutive
losses to Iowa and Minnesota
midway through conference play
marked the beginning of an ugly
streak, marring an otherwise
impressive record. After starting


the season with the best record in
program history, the Wolverines
capped Big Ten play by losing to
Ohio State on the road - a team
that might not even make the
NCAA Tournament.
If Michigan has any chance at
postseason success, it must start
with its perimeter shooting and
rebounding. Senior guard Kate
Thompson leads the team in scor-
ing with 14.5 points per game but
has been rhythmless from the
3-point line recently. The All-Big
Ten second-team player is one
of the most dynamic shooters in
the country, but her inconsisten-
cy has plagued the Wolverines'
offense late in the season.
Barnes Arico's presence has
reemphasized the importance of
rebounding.
Last season's -3.9 rebound-
ing margin has transformed
into a plus-3.0 margin. Accord-


ingly, Michigan is 15-3 when
out-rebounding its opponent this
season.
Next Monday, known as
"Selection Monday," the NCAA's
selection committee will release
the bracket. The Wolverines must
wait to scout its opponent until
then, but this week will provide
a much-needed opportunity for
Michigan to nurse any lingering
injuries and prepare strategies for
the tournament.
"We're just going to keep
working until Selection Monday
comes around," Ryan said. "We
hope we're in a good seed, and we
feel like we are with our resume.
That's all we have to go on right
now.
"We're going to keep getting
better day by day like we have all
year and hope that when Selec-
tion Monday comes we're in the

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico (top) and senior guard Jenny Ryan will lead
Michigan in postseason play. The Wolverines have been hot and cold this season.

Recent spate of
breakaways is an
anomaly, coach says
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily SportsEditor
On Friday night, while some
students tried to make the most of
the end of spring break by drink-
ing excessively, senior Kevin
Lynch had a blackout of his own
during the Michigan hockey
team's game against Northern
Michigan in the first round of the
CCHA playoffs.
Midway through the first peri-
od, the forward poked the puck
away from a Northern Michi-
gan player in the neutral zone

and went on a breakaway. As he
approached the Wildcat goal, he
faked netminder Jared Coreau
left before burying the puck in the
bottom-right corner.
It's all a blur for Lynch, though.
"I usually black out when I get
on breakaways," Lynch said. "I
had no idea what was going on. I
thought if I made a quick move,
(the goalie would) bite it. I think
he bit too hard (and) I kind of got
lucky there."
Lynch's score was the go-ahead
goal for Michigan that night, and
it was thanks to his ability to capi-
talize on the breakaway opportu-
nity.
Odd-man rushes, especial-
ly breakaways, haven't always

season. Last weekend, though,

breakaway chances two to three
times a week, Berenson says
there's nothing they can really
do to create odd-man rushes in
games - they're situations that
arise on their own, a matter of
luck more than anything else.
"In these games, a bounce of
the puck or a quick good play and
you could get an (odd-man rush),"
Berenson said. "The (players)
don't know what's going to hap-
pen in the game. We're just going
to have to play our game and see
what happens."
Berenson cited Western Michi-
gan's goals-against average (sec-
ond in the CCHA) as the chief

reason why he's not putting too
much attention on odd-man rush-
es for this upcoming series. Since
goals will be precious this week-
end anyway, Berenson doesn't
want to risk sloppy play on the
small chance that the breakaway
will pay off - especially since the
Wolverines gave up eight goals the
last time they played in Kalama-
zoo in January.
"We sure can't go in there
sacrificing defense on the road,"
Berenson said. "So we've got to
play smart and be on the right
side of the puck. Then we've g6t to
make our chances count and play
ugly hockeyif we have to."

Becoming a "Good Girl"
by Carlina Duan

0 the science of it all: a clean slate by jenniferxu

In all likelihood, you're
acquainted with someone who's
a germaphobe. They shudder vis-
ibly when you offer them a swig
of your soda, pump and dump
out the contents of the Purell
dispenser in the corner and give
death stares at the barista wip-
ing the countertop with a part-
sodden rag.
Though some are quick to point
out these symptoms as borderline
Obsessive

Disorder,
evolution-
arily, we do
have justi-
fied cause for x
being para-
noid about
infectious
diseases.
According
to a survey
conducted
by the glob-
al hygiene
company
SCA, only 71
percent of
adults said
they washed
their hands
on a regular
basis, and 58
percent said
they had seen
other people
leave a pub-
lic bathroom
without washing their hands.
Yet on some level, our over-
stated concern for personal
hygiene is in our minds. There's
a new theory floating around the
social psychology cosmos called
embodiment, which basically
means that our cognitive pro-
cesses are grounded in sensory
experiences and bodily states.

Simplified, we tend to think with
our bodies.
Embodiment can be detected
looking at the metaphors we
engage with -on a day-to-day
basis - many of them have some-
thing to do with the body. We
measure our relationships with
other people by body lengths: A
bad relationship is described as a
"distant" one; a good relationship
is deemed "close." We see our

E3

other people allows us to meta-
phorically wipe the slate clean.
Studies have discovered that
cleaning one's hands with soap
or an antiseptic wipe can dimin-
ish feelings of guilt from moral
transgressions, whereas engag-
ing in unethical behaviors could
increase the appeal of purchas-
ing cleaning products. In one
experiment, participants were
instructed to tella lie to an imagi-
nary colleague,
and were then
asked in a sur-
vey how much
they were will-
ing to pay for
mouthwash
and hand sani-
tizer. Those
who engaged
in the lie were
willing to pay
more for the
cleaning prod-
ucts than those
who did not.
The embodi-
ment hypoth-
esis for the
significance
of physical
cleansing can
justify a lot of
weird logic in
our daily lives.
Why we jump
into the shower
to wash off past
memories after
a crappy day; why we call virgins
"clean" and sluts "dirty"; why
baptism involves "cleansing"
away our sins. Cleanliness is next
to godliness, after all.
So the next time you reach for
that disinfectant, ask yourself:
Are you really worried about your
personal hygiene, or are you just
cleansing your moral agenda?

"Fingas!" Mrs. Liu demands again.
Sheepishly, I slide my hands on top of the
keyboard.
Mrs. Liu raps me on the knuckles once. Not
a hard rap, but a strict flick of her palm that
means only one thing: Bad Girl. Her hands
are slender, the hands of a knowing woman
who clips her nails each Sunday and sweeps
the shavings into a tin trashcan. My hands are
eight years old. They are chubby and unwise.
In my 10 years of playing the piano, Mrs.
Liu never called me a "Good Girl."
Instead, my Good Girl status was reduced
each Sunday afternoon, when I sat in front of
a piano and plunked fingers that weren't built
for grace notes or arpeggios. In the car, after
nursing my weary knuckles, I'd whine to my
mom: "Can't you just get me a white teacher?
I don't like Mrs. Liu. I'd actually practice if I
understood what she was saying."
But the truth was I had no trouble deci-
phering Mrs. Liu's criticism. In fact, I under-
stood her disapproval quite clearly. Each
knuckle-whack carried a slap of condemna-
tion: Bad Girl. I disliked piano lessons, but it
wasn't because Mrs. Liu wasn't white. It was
because she was, like my mother, Chinese,
and her furrowed eyebrows meant I was fail-
ing to be a Good Chinese Daughter.
When I ask my Facebook friends what they
think of the term "Good Girl," my childhood
friend David answers within 40 seconds.
"do you consider yourself a good girl oO,"
he writes, tacking on a wild-eyed emoticon to
his sentence for sarcasm.
I can tell he doesn't expect a real answer.
In fact, his emoticon implies that he already
knows the real answer. I do consider myself
a Good Girl. Or at least, I consider myself a
Good Daughter. Are the two interchangeable?
I'm notsure. Good Girls make to-do lists, then
check off each completed task. We don't earn
knuckle-raps from our teachers. We practice
the piano, and excel. Our parents beam. Good
Girls are successful.
I call my mom on the phone over the week-
end. When she picks up, she's grumpy, frying
shrimp with one hand, dangling the phone
with the other.
"Mom," I start cautiously, "I need your
thoughts on something."
"Huh?" she squawks.
"What does it mean to be good?"
Silence.
"I mean, how does a girl become 'good?'"
I prod. "Did your mom teach you how to be
good? Or did you just know how?"
My mom remains quiet. I'm curious. I
never hear anybody use the term "Good
Woman," yet I know clearly my mother is
"Good" in the sense of fulfilling duties, in the
sense of giving us love. Does she know this
herself? Atwhat poiiiFdowomen le'ave thei-

good girlhood behind ... or can they ever? Is
my mom, at age 52, still a Good Girl?
The flip of shrimp skin hisses dirtily on the
pan.
"You want to be good?" My mom scoffs,
"You cook."
At home, my mom plants an oven mitt into
my hands slowly, as if the fabric will crumble
at my touch. She grimaces.
"It's about time you do this," she growls.
I don't blame her urgency. I'll be moving
into an apartment with my best friend next
year, and our plan so far is to thrive on pre-
made salads and peanut butter. I'm no good
in the kitchen. The first time I cracked open
an egg, the yolk slid from its shell onto the
floor like a yellow sun hatched across the
dirt. When it comes to food, nobody in my
family is a waster. The trashcan is a holy
place, reserved only for the scraped clean
and utterly broken: melon rinds gnawed,
white jars of pickled tofu licked until the
glass scratches tongues. I've been taught
that a part of being good is being resource-
ful: finding a recipe for every piece of the
fruit, including the seeds.
"Help me make the red bean bread," my
mom commands.
I crack the white walls of an egg. Its yel-
low center flops to the floor. Shit. Bad Girl, I
reprimand myself.
I fear my mom will lash out at my yolky
mishap. To be a Good Girl and a Good Chi-
nese Daughter requires constant discipline, a
reminder to the self that any waste you create
- even by accident - will be deemed a failure.
"When I was your age, I was cooking din-
ner every night for the family," my mom huffs,
strutting around the floors in palaid apron.
"Of course, it was differentback then. Your
grandma ani igraiitdW vere i'orking all the

time. They had no time to cook for the rest of
us. It was a matter of helping the rest of the
family survive," she says simply, stirring a
bowl of sweet redbean paste.
"You?" She jabs her chopstick in my direc-
tion. "What do you know how to make?
Nothing. What do you know how to clean?
Nothing. But what do you play with when you
are small? Dolls. Ai-yah! Dolls! Yellow-haired
yang wa-wa."
She spits, "How will that help you survive?
You know what I play with when I am small?
Candy wrappers, if I am lucky. We only get
candy once ayear, on Chinese New Year's."

a Good American Girl to my peers? The two
definitions carry completely different con-
notations. At school, I feel Good when others
pound me on the back after telling a hearty
joke. Praise is easy to come by. At home, while
I cook with my mother, she reminds me that
I still haven't fulfilled my promise to learn
how to make dumplings. I'm left, again, with
failure.
As a dauighter of Chinese immigrants, I feel
obligated to do right by my mother, who, at
times, seems too small. When we're in public,
my mother gives off the aura of a very good
and very helpless girl, swallowed inside a vast
space of stars, stripes and strange country.
In movie theaters, she'd grab my hand and
hold it throughout the entire film. Clueless
to the English dialogue, I'd whisper Chinese
translations into her ear, clarifying what-
ever action was going on. Girlish, my mother
threw back her head and cawed in gorgeous
laughter when I brought home wildflowers
from school one day. If anything, sometimes
I feel as if the roles are reversed - that I
become a sort of mom and she the vulnerable
daughter whom I want to protect, to teach.
On Facebook, my Women's Studies major
friend Claire writes, "A 'good girl' doesn't
actually exist. It's a contrived, patriarchal
image that makes it easier for women to be
subjected to external & social criticism."
Six people 'liked' her comment. I was
tempted. There are times when I wish, like
my friends, that labels like Good Girl and Bad
Girl didn't exist. But the labels that we slip
into are more present in 2013 than they have
ever been. In the age of profile construction
on mediums such as Twitter and Facebook,
it seems that we're asking questions like,
"WHO AM I?" in more explicit terms than
we ever have before. The world today is just
as overwhelming as the world was in my
mother's decade. Human connection is still
immense and scary. Only now, technology
demands that we define ourselves. By being
a Good Girl, I'm being placed within a com-
munity of other Good Girls, with similar
interests, similar tastes. Is identity valida-
tion really such a bad thing?
The truth is, I'm comfortable being a Good
Girl. While the rules are complicated and, at
times, restrictive, I know them - and what's
more, I belong to them. I'd be uncomfortable
reconstructing myself as anything else.
My mom and I knead dough for the red
bean bread. She pounds flour into pockets of-
dough. In the kitchen, we stand side-by-side.
Our Good Girl fingers flutter with dust.
Neither of us were born Good Girls. We
were taught how to bake bread by the moth-
ers before us, standing in a kitchen with
morning light hissing through the window
- neither blessing, nor curse.

Chinese heritage that sneak up on us and
cloud me with guilt. Living in-between two
cultures is always a matter of prioritization.
But, I'm never sure what to prioritize - being

Mary Jo Desprez, Alcohol and Other Drug
Policy and Prevention Program Administra-
tor, leads the University's effort to educate
students about the potential dangers of drug
and alcohol abuse. Desprez said that stu-
dents could face major legal consequences
when dealing with prescription stimulants.
u' "It is illegal to share a prescription drug
with someone else," Desprez said. "The pen-
alties could include jail, although that's the
extreme case."
Students found with non-prescribed med-
ication in their possession may face different
consequences based on whether the police
feel the student shows intent to distribute,
Desprez said. Therefore, a student found
with 100 Adderall pills will face very differ-
ent treatment than a student found with one
or two.
One concern for the University is the
trend among students to use stimulants in
conjunction with alcohol or other drugs,
a potentially life-threatening combina-
tion. Desprez's office has worked to create
resources to educate about the dangers.
However, due to the prevalence of alcohol
abuse on campus compared to prescription
-drug abuse, the AODPP primarily incorpo-
rates drug abuse information within its alco-
hol abuse educational programs.

"One of the things we try to do is be
good stewards of resources and match our
outreach to the level of damage and use,"
Desprez said.
Even with the sustained efforts by uni-
versities across the nation, an increasing
number of students are opting to use - in
some cases, promoting the use of - pre-
scription stimulants.
Debate erupted last November when
the University of Miami student newspa-
per, The Miami Hurricane, published an
opinion article by student Robert Pursell
avidly promoting the use of stimulants by
students without prescription.
"The worst thing that anyone has ever
done on Adderall is clean a dorm room and
look up far too many song lyrics," Prusell
wrote. "It's hard to abuse a drug whose
main side effects are productivity and
finding linear algebra interesting."
The article ended with Prusell's call to
action: "Medicate Miami. You've earned
it."
Prusell's article drew criticism and sup-
port from across the nation. And here at the
University, students are equally divided on

the issue. While many support the use of
stimulants, some are taking an active role
in speaking out against their misuse.
LSA senior Anjali Bisht and LSA junior
Clancey D'Isa first studied prescription
drug abuse in a Women's Studies course
last semester. As part of the course, they
conducted an independent research study
to examine the nature of stimulant abuse
among University undergrads.
About 370 University students completed
the survey. The students were asked a num-
ber of questions regarding their experiences
with stimulant medications, as well as basic
information about their lifestyle and stand-
ing at the University.
"(Prescription drug abuse) is prevalent
across ... ethnicities, race, sex and class,"
Bisht said. "We want this (study) to raise
awareness to the campus wide community
that something needs to happen."
Their women's studies profesor, Carol
Boyd, was primarily interested in the price
of illegal stimulants on campus. Through
their survey, D'Isa and Bisht found that stu-
dents pay an average of $5 per pill during
most of the semester, a cost that can rise dur-
ing exam times.
The study found that for many students,
the primary motivation for abusing stimu-

lants is better grades. However the research
found almost no evidence confirming an
increase in academic performance with the
illegal use of these drugs.
D'Isa and Bisht emphasized that these
drugs have confirmed positive impacts for
individuals with ADHD and other similar
conditions, but that there have been almost
no studies on students who take the drug as
a "study aid."
"There's a lot of people who would like to
tell you how helpful it is," D'Isa said. "(How-
ever) you could probably give people sugar
pills and see them respond the same way."
D'Isa said that these drugs will present a
challenge for University officials to regulate,
given how they differ from other controlled
substances.
"It's easier to get stimulant pills than alco-
hol if you're underage," D'Isa said. "The fact
that people are getting it from their family
and friends means they are connected in a
very intimate, personal way - not like going
to a dealer."
Bisht and D'Isa concluded their study
with the hope that the University "can lessen
the impact that misuse of prescription stim-
ulant medications has had on our campus,"
as well as increase education about "the non-
medical use of prescription stimulants."

how students on campus misuse stimulats

J ts not so much peer pressure as
peer acceptance."
"Because it's so accepted
among a lot of people," Kinesiology fresh-
man Andrew said. "You don't see any harm
in doing it."
Within the increasingly competitive
college environment, where students are
being pushed to achieve socially, academi-
cally and professionally, academic "per-
formance enhancers" are being widely
abused. Across the nation, students turn
to these stimulants in an attempt to gain
a mental edge.
Prescribed in various forms like Adder-
all and Ritalin to treat conditions like
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,
amphetamines and methylphenidates are
the most common 'study aids' abused on
campuses.
For about $5 per pill - $10 during finals
week - students buy these drugs from
dorm mates, study partners and even fam-
ily members.
Like many of his fellow students,
Andrew said he often struggles to keep up
when he has multiple projects and exams
to worry about each week. When these
projects start to stack up, Andrew takes
Adderall to help him get through a long
day in the UGLi.
Despite serious legal consequences for
taking Adderall - or any similar medica-
tion - without a prescription, Andrew
feels the risk is worth it.
"I find so far that it's extremely ben-

eficial," Andrew said. "Some people feel
like there's a negative connotation around
Adderall just because its not an open, legal
drug ... If I could only do one drug the rest
of my collegiate career, it would most like-
ly be Adderall because I feel that the aca-
demic upside to it is so significant that it
can only help."
Since coming to the University he has
taken the drug five or six times while
studying.
"It's pretty common during finals sea-
son," Andrew said. "It doesn't necessarily
improve your work, it just makes you focus
more. It doesn't make you smarter, you can
just get your work done faster."
When he feels the need to "really get
work done," he buys Adderall from a friend
who is prescribed the drug for ADHD. It
has a positive effect on his work, making
him act "normally" but with high produc-
tivity levels.
"It's impossible to detect," he said. "If
I'm sitting next to you in the library and
we're both doing work, but I'm doing my
work a little bit faster and a little less dis-
tracted, nobody will be able to notice."
Andrew said he didn't feel pressured
into taking Adderall, but the prevalence of
the drug on campus dissuaded his worries.
"It's not like people are pressuring you
to do it, you just don't see any downside to
doing it," he said.

"I think it is a dangerous problem."
Robert Ernst, medical director at Uni-
versity Health Services said UHS pre-
scribes stimulant medications to help
students with ADHD and Attention Deficit
Disorder. For these students, stimulants
are extremely beneficial, because they
increase alertness, focus and energy.
However, given the well-known poten-
tial for abuse - especially on college cam-
puses - UHS does not diagnose students
with ADHD or ADD. Instead, they rely on
the diagnoses and treatment plans devel-
oped by outside physicians. Students can
only obtain a prescription from UHS with
a confirmed diagnosis from their own phy-
sician and a history of successful treat-
ment with stimulants.
While some physicians with more expe-
rience feel comfortable diagnosing ADHD
with only a patient history, others rely on
surveys or questionnaires developed to
help physicians diagnose the disease.
"Increasingly, (physicians) are believ-
ing that students can give the right
answers on a survey to make it sound like
ADHD," Ernst said. "It was because of sit-
uations like that we decided we didn't feel
comfortable making that diagnosis based
upon this survey."
For students diagnosed outside the Uni-
versity, Ernst said UHS still takes precau-
tionswhendistributingthesemedications.
"This is as controversial as it gets on col-
lege campuses, and many colleges' health
services have a 'just say no' approach to

this," Ernst said. "We don't look
our role to make the diagnosis and
treatment, but welcome the oppc
to establish continuity relationshi
students who have an established
sis and are already stable on a regil
Even for students who demon
legitimate need for medication, ar
prescription is required to obtai
pills.
Stimulants are classified as S
II drugs in the U.S. under the Co
Substances Act. The U.S. Drug E
ment Administration heavily r
these drugs based on their poten
abuse.
"Any time you have a Schedule
trolled substance,
you are going. to
have a lot of (legal
precautions),"
Gwedolyn Chivers,
director of the UHS
Pharmacy, said.
In recent years,
some physicians
have started diag-
nosing students
with ADHD and
Attention Defi-
cit Disorder once
they get to college,
despite the fact
that these disorders
should manifest by
the age of seven in
most patients. This _
inconsistency "con-
founds" many col-
lege health service
clinicians, Ernst
said.
"We feel uncom-
fortable malt-
ing the diagnosis,
because it's just not
the general notion
that people pres-
ent as adults, although that's incrc
becoming the situation - adding
concern that these are being used t
the drugs or used for competitive
tage instead of for an established
sis," Ernst said.
Students taking Adderall withou
scription - or who take the medic
performance enhancer, instead o
ment for a condition - risk a range
to serious side effects, includingc
ing sleep, affecting appetite -tw
common side affects - and heart
tion.
"I've seen students come in an
ent with cardiac arrhythmia and d
after a couple of follow up questio
they had borrowed a couple Adder
lets from a friend," Ernst said.
Controversy arose in Februar

at it as Richard Fee, a student at Greensboro Col- si
initiate lege in North Carolina, died after becoming of
artunity addicted to Adderall and other medica- r
ps with tions, which were repeatedly prescribed m
diagno- despite protests from Fee's parents that he e
ment." did not have ADHD. According to The New
strate a York Times, Fee's addiction may have con- m
monthly tributed to his suicide, though "few people s
n more who misuse stimulants devolve into psy- h
chotic or suicidal addicts." t
chedule Some students feel it's safe to take sa
ntrolled another person's prescription, since their (t
Enforce- friend with the prescription does not expe-
egulates rience any side affects. Ernst said every fu
atial for patient responds differently, so students ca
are putting themselves at great risk by tak-
II con- ing these drugs. d
"If I'm sitting next to you
in the library and we're
both doing work, but I'm
doing my work a little bit
faster and a little less
distracted, nobody will
be able to notice."

The UHS physicians are aware that
id pres- many students prescribed these medica- e
lisclose, tions do not take them on a consistent c
ins, that basis, creating the potential for a surplus. m
rall tab- When students come in asking for the re
maximum quantity of pills, Ernst said he p
y when and other physicians will often become tI

uspicious and enter into a "negotiation"
ver the medication to "come up with a
ealistic quantity," where they try to deter-
ine how many pills a student really needs
ach month.
"We know that students don't take these
edicines all the time when they're pre-
cribed, and when someone is reliable for a
igh quantity, we start (to) wonder if this is
o create a surplus for distribution," Ernst
aid. "Afterthree to five visits, we can start
o) feel pretty comfortable negotiating."
Ernst is seriously concerned about the
uture for prescription drugs on college
ampuses.
"I do believe the misuse of prescription
rugs will continue to become an increas-
ing prevalent prob-
lem - and I think
college campuses
will be 'ground
zero' for that type of
behavior."
Students misus-
ing prescription
stimulants not*only
face physical side
effects, but also
expose themselves
to major legal con-
sequences if caught.
When asked about
these consequences,
Andrew was uncon-
cerned. He could
not remember a sin-
gle case of someone
being arrested or
even questioned for
prescription- drug
abuse.
"I guess it's a
'strength in num-
bers' type situation
... I'm not the only
erson using it, there's so many other peo-
le. One person is not going to get singled
ut," he said.
Diane Brown, University Police spokes-
erson, said campus police very rarely
rrest and prosecute individuals for pre-
cription drug abuse.
In 2011, there were only 102 drug arrests
n campus - compared to 314 alcohol
elated arrests or citations - according to
he University's most recent annual safe-
y report. It's not known what amount of
hose arrests relate to Adderall.
There is currently one drug recognition
xpert in the University Police. In most
ases, however, the University Police's
nain responsibility is to assure students
eceive proper medical attention when
rescription drugs present a danger to
heir health, Brown said.
