With another record number 

of applications submitted for 
the fall 2018 freshman class, 
the University of Michigan-
Ann Arbor campus enrollment 
has seen increased economic 
diversity and higher numbers 
of underrepresented students, 
according to a report published 
by University Public Affairs.

The 
University 
received 

an 8 percent increase in 
applications 
for 
the 
fall 

2018 
freshman 
class. 

More 
specifically, 
64,917 

applications were received, 
14,818 were offered admission, 
and 6,695 enrolled, making a 

slightly smaller freshman class 
than last year. For in-state 
applicants, 40.5 percent of 
those who applied were offered 
admission. 
For 
out-of-state 

and 
international 
students, 

18.8 
percent 
were 
offered 

admission. 
Seventy-two 

percent of in-state freshmen 
accepted the admission offer 
and 31.8 percent of out-of-
state or international students 
accepted the offer.

Erica Sanders, director of 

undergraduate 
admissions, 

discussed the rising levels of 
interest and applications each 
year, explaining the process 
used by admissions officers to 
accept incoming freshmen.

“We’re continually amazed 

More than 100 students, 

faculty and staff attended 
the event “There’s Always 
Someone Who Doesn’t Want 
You to Vote” Tuesday at 
Tisch Hall at the University 
of 
Michigan. 
The 
event 

discussed historical targeting 
of 
minority 
groups 
and 

infringement of voting rights 
throughout the voting process 
ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm 
elections. 

The 
panel 
began 
with 

remarks from Heather Ann 
Thompson, 
a 
professor 

in 
the 
Department 
of 

Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies, who discussed the 
impact of mass incarceration 
on voting today. She drew 
from historical policy trends 
post-Civil War and during 
the civil rights movement 
of mass imprisonment that 
directly 
targeted 
Black 

males. 
To 
illustrate 
her 

point, she referenced a study 
which revealed Black men in 
apartheid South Africa had 
lower rates of incarceration 
than they do today in the 
United States. She explained 
voting is not an act which 
solely 
affects 
individual 

rights, but also the 40,000 
citizens in Michigan who are 
incarcerated.

“Right 
away 
we 
are 

discounting a huge swath of 
our population that cannot 

access the ballot,” Thompson 
said. “Of the people from 
these communities who can 
access the ballot, there is 
such community devastation 
from mass incarceration that 
there is a disincentive to vote. 
People are very disinclined 
to imagine that the voting 
system is for them.”

Thompson also mentioned 

prison 
gerrymandering, 

where 
incarcerated 
people 

are 
moved 
to 
prisons 
in 

certain counties to obtain 
more power. In Michigan, 
the 
prison 
population 

disproportionately 
comes 

from Detroit and four state 
Senate districts only meet the 
federal minimum population 
requirements 
by 
claiming 

prisoners as constituents. 

“Those who benefit most 

from funding prisons instead 
of schools, roads, we can 

go on and on, those people 
have more voting power than 
anyone 
else, 
simply 
put,” 

Thompson said. “That means 
that those who are most in 
need of weighing in with what 
we do with our state’s budget, 
those of us who are hoping 
for more public education 
funding, those of us who are 
worried about the potholes, 
who 
are 
worried 
about 

With days until the election, 

resurfacing the documentary 
“Michigan Divided” from earlier 
this year seems appropriate. The 
film focuses on the differences 
and 
similarities 
between 

Michigan residents from across 
the state and the political 
spectrum.

The film’s producer, Bridge 

reporter Ron French, discussed 
the logistics of the film and 
editorial decisions made behind 
the scenes at the Ford School 
of Public Policy Tuesday night 
as part of Bridge Magazine’s 
“Michigan Truth Tour.” He 
defended his team’s call to 
included segments where a 
President 
Trump 
supporter 

from 
Harbor 
Springs 
cited 

unsubstantiated claims Trump 
made as a candidate.

“Actually, I felt that was a very 

important part of the film to 
have in there — to show the sort 
of bad information that some 
people have and on which they 
make their decisions,” French 
said. “We made a conscious

First-generation student panelists

The panel, hosted by the Office of

defining what it means to be a

how this identity applies to many 
students regardless of race, gender

“Because it is an invisible identity 

... it can be hard to know who’s first

over 3,500 first-gen students on this

about these students and hearing 

about their narratives is going to be 
really critical as we move forward in 
doing the work that we do.”

Though first-generation students 

account for a sizable portion of the 
total students on campus, they are 
still a distinct minority and often 
struggle to find resources to help 
them acclimate to the demands

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | OCTOBER 31, 2018


At 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, a professor in the 
Department of Astronomy is 
taking the phrase “reach for the 
stars” to a whole new level.

In 
a 
new 
discovery, 

Astronomy Prof. Sally Oey and 
her team observed runaway 
stars using Gaia, a new satellite 
launched 
by 
the 
European 

Space Agency.

“What we were originally 

trying to do was look for 
runaway stars and those are 
massive stars,” Oey said. “So 
they’re moving really fast and … 

this satellite is able to see very 
tiny motions of stars in the sky 
with extreme accuracy.”

LSA junior Johnny Dorigo 

Jones has been working with 
Oey monitoring runaway stars 
for a year. He said his primary 
role was to synthesize the 
data and construct pictorial 
representations of the findings.

“My main role with this 

paper was working with all the 
data from Gaia and creating the 
image showing all of the arrows 
that you might have seen in one 
of the press releases,” Dorigo 
Jones said.

Oey said the new satellite is 

able to detect the motions of 

stars in a smaller companion 
galaxy of the Milky Way around 
150,000 light years away. The 
new technology, she explained, 
will shed a new light on the 
studies of the Milky Way and 
other galaxies.

“I think this new telescope, 

in particular, is something that 
has really revolutionized our 
view of our own galaxy and in 
nearby galaxies because we can 
really see the stars as objects 
that are in motion now,” Oey 
said.

During her research, Oey 

said her team noticed how one 
section of a satellite galaxy was 
moving in the same direction 

and wanted to consult 
outside help to investigate 
the astronomical finding.

“We were like ‘Woah, 

what is that?’” Oey said. 
“When all of those stars in 
one section of the galaxy 
are moving together in 
one direction, so that’s 
when we got in touch 
with this professor at the 
University 
of 
Arizona, 

Gurtina Besla.”

Besla is an associate 

professor 
in 
the 

Department of Astronomy 
and Steward Observatory 
at 
the 
University 
of 

Arizona, 
focusing 
on 

theoretical 
astrophysics 

and 
galaxy 
formation. 

In 
conjunction 
with 

Oey, Besla modeled the 
interaction between the 
two satellite galaxies. 

“She’s 
modeled 
the 

interaction of these two 
galaxies 
and 
she 
had 

predicted back in 2012 
that the two Magellanic 
clouds 
galaxies 
should 

have collided with each 
other,” Oey said.

Oey said if these two galaxies 

had a direct collision, then the 
smaller Magellanic cloud stars 
would be gravitationally drawn 
to the large Magellanic cloud — 
this is what the research team 
observed.

“So these observations are 

actually confirming her theory, 
her prediction, that these two 
galaxies have had a direct 
collision,” Oey said. “We were 
originally interested in looking 
for the runaway stars but this 
was just something that we 
happened to see and it was a 
very very cool result.”

LSA freshman Max Resnick 

said though he doesn’t know 
much about astronomy, he finds 
the research fascinating and 
ground-breaking.

“Though it might not directly 

affect us that two galaxies 
collided hundreds of millions of 
lightyears away, it’s still really 
cool to think about something 
that grand and happening in 
our universe,” Resnick said.

Jones said he was excited 

by the confirmation of some of 
Professor Besla’s predictions by 
kinematic evidence from the 
Gaia telescope.

“It’s 
always 
cool 
when 

the simulations and actual 
observations 
can 
line 
up,” 

Dorigo Jones said. “It’s really 
cool that we were able to use this 
data from the new very accurate 
telescope Gaia to confirm some 
of these predictions.” 

According to Resnick, new 

discoveries can be beneficial to 
many, not just astronomers.

“I would say there are some 

things in any science which 
can be applied to other sciences 
that might be more directly 
impactful to our lives,” Resnick 
said.

APPLE HILL STRING QUARTET

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: STUDENTS DISCUSS MENTALITY BEHIND REVEALING HALLOWEEN 
COSTUMES

October 28, 2011
By Alexandra Mundalen

This weekend, hoards of 

students will roam the streets 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 
dressed 
as 

celebrities, witches, animals 
and pop-culture references, 
while 
wearing 
costumes 

comprised 
of 
tight 
and 

revealing clothing.

Emily 
Richard, 
shift 

manager at American Apparel 
on East Liberty Street, said 
the store fills with shoppers 
searching 
for 
the 
perfect 

costume in the week leading 
up to Halloween — the store’s 
busiest time of the year. Though 

American Apparel doesn’t offer 
packaged costumes, she said it 
sells enough metallic spandex 
and lacy leotards to meet the 
demand of students trying 
to complete their collegiate 
Halloween ensemble.

Richard said she thinks 

female 
students 
often 
opt 

for more revealing costumes 
because of media influence.

“I think it’s kind of easy to go 

the slutty route because that’s 
how Halloween is marketed 
towards girls,” she said.

LSA freshman Abby Lyng 

and 
Engineering 
freshman 

Jillian Jackson said having 
the perfect costume is a one-

way ticket to the best parties, 
as students often compete for 
recognition for the time and 
money spent on their costumes.

Lyng 
said 
she 
dislikes 

dressing 
up 
in 
revealing 

costumes in the cold weather, 
but said that for her and many 
of her peers, practicality and 
sensibility are forfeited on 
Halloween weekend.

LSA 
sophomore 
Paige 

Lester, a member of F-Word 
— a feminist activist group 
on campus — said at the 
organization’s 
meeting 
last 

night that she thinks females

on 
campus 
should 
be 

entitled 
to 
wear 
whatever 

they please on the holiday. to 
im “I think that girls should 
be able to wear whatever they 
want on Halloween,” Lester 
said. 
Catherine 
Berlucchi, 

attendingmanager of Allure 
Boutique 
on 
East 
Liberty 

Street, said the items that 
transform a run-of-the-mill 
cat costume into a sex kitten 
are still in high demand. The 
store sells garter belts and 
fishnet tights to the demand 
of students specifically before 
Halloween. LSA sophomore 
Gia Tame, another member 
of F-Word, said women often 
dress to impress their male 
peers, but questions if the 

same is true for men. “Girls are 
usually dressing for the guys 
because that’s what

think that they have to do,”
mone said. “But are they 

dressing for the girls?”

LSA senior Matt Mortellaro 

said he thinks students often 
dress up on Halloween with the 
intention of impressing others 
than for their own enjoyment. 
“I reject the idea that we 
dress strictly for ourselves,” 
Mortellaro said. “I’m not sure 
that’s possible.” Though there 
might be a mentality among 
female 
students 
that 
men 

prefer scantily dressed women 
on 
Halloween, 
some 
male 

students believed the contrary. 
LSA freshmen Scott Marlatt 
and Benjamin Schmutzer said 
they would rather approach a 
girl dressed in a creative and 
unique costume at a party, 
rather than a girl dressed 
provocatively. “I think that it’s 
wrong,” Marlatt said. “A lot 
of girls are pressured into it 
because it’s what every other 
girl does ... the nurse costume, 
the sailor - all those things are 
overplayed.”

University before he dove into 
a pool and broke his neck — 
paralyzing him from the chest 
down. He said being exposed 
to adaptive sports gave him 
the opportunity to continue to 
participate in sports that were 
a major part of his previous life.

Oklanlami 
concluded 
his 

proposal by saying an adaptive 
sports program would help 
the 
University 
attract 
a 

diverse 
student 
body 
that 

values inclusivity and would 
demonstrate 
that 
adaptive 

sports are for everyone.

“There are so many other 

sports 
that 
we 
can 
allow 

everyone 
to 
have 
access,” 

Okanlami 
said. 
“Eventually 

it would not be a team full of 
people with disabilities, it could 
be having a specific event in the 
Big Ten championships that is 
a Paralympic event that allows 
the points to be for everyone.”

Rackham 
student 
Austin 

Glass, CSG speaker of the 
assembly, said he believes an 
adaptive sports program would 
be a beneficial addition to the 
University.

“I am hoping to work on this 

addition,” Glass said. “It might 
not be soon, but it’s certainly 
going to set a pipeline.”

Following 
Okanlami’s 

presentation, attorney Douglas 
Lewis, director of Student Legal 
Services, and Gayle Rosen, an 
attorney with Student Legal 
Services, answered questions 
regarding the possible creation 
of a new tenants’ union in Ann 

Arbor.

The 
previous 
Ann 
Arbor 

Tenants’ Union existed for 35 
years before shutting down in 
2004 due to funding loss. Rents 
have risen steadily in Ann Arbor 
in last decade — the median rate 
for rent in Ann Arbor increased 
14 percent from 2010 to 2015 
reaching $1,075 per month.

“The tenants’ union helped 

a lot of things happen in 
government 
in 
this 
town 

that wouldn’t have happened 
without it,” Lewis said. “I think 
their last shot was trying to get 
rent control in Ann Arbor.”

Both Lewis and Rosen said 

they would want to support the 
creation of a new tenants’ union.

“I think if it’s something most 

people want to consider,” Rosen 
said. “It probably makes sense to 
get a group of people together of 

someone who used to be on the 
tenants’ union and talk about 
what the structure should be.”

CSG has previously received 

backlash regarding affordability 
guidelines and the search for 
housing, and believes that the 
creation of a tenants’ union 
could be a step in the right 
direction.

At a panel on affordability last 

week, State Rep. Yousef Rabhi 
said the onus would largerly 
rested on students to organize. 

“The Tenants Union was 

valuable partially because of 
its independence,” Rabhi said. 
“I don’t think politicians or 
University officials can recreate 
something like the Tenants 
Union. People in this room need 
to take it upon themselves to 
help start something up like that 
again.”

of 
college. 
According 
to 
the 

2016 Campus ClimateSurvey on 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, 
first-generation students comprise 
approximately 8 percent of the 
student body and are, on the whole, 
less satisfied with the campus 
climate than their continuing-
generation counterparts.

Panelist 
Jiten 
Parbhoo, 
an 

LSA senior, said coming to the 
University as a first-generation 
student 
was 
a 
bewildering 

experience at first because he did 
not know the basics of how college 
functioned.

“I didn’t know what credits 

were,” Parbhoo said. “I didn’t know 
how many credits you need to take, 
or what’s a four-credit class, or 
what’s a lab and why it’s different 
from a class ... They don’t know 
anything, really. That was the 
biggest part. Also, you don’t really 
know what you don’t know. That’s 
the hardest part.”

A lot of the discussion focused 

on the role mentorship can play in 
forming support networks for first-
generation students and helping 
them understand these basic facts. 
Resources such as First-Generation 
College Students @ Michigan, an 
organization created in 2007 by 
undergraduates, provides events 
and 
workshops 
for 
students 

navigating the University for the 
first time. Panelist Taryn Hayes, 
an LSA junior, said her experience 
with mentorship in the Women 
in 
Science 
and 
Engineering 

residential community gave her the 
confidence to pursue a field that she 
previously shied away from.

“WISE was amazing,” Hayes 

said. “It really supports women in 
STEM, because women are often 
underrepresented in STEM fields. 
I truly believe that if I wasn’t in 
WISE, I wouldn’t be pre-med still 
today. It’s a really intimidating field 
and I received nothing but support 
from my peers and my advisers.”

Siddiqi, who moderated the 

discussion, was a first-generation 
at the University as well and 
noted how 32 different mentoring 
programs on campus give students 

a sense of direction that their 
parents are often not in the position 
to offer.

“I 
was 
in 
the 
Transfer 

Connections mentoring program, 
and it shaped me as a person and 
shaped what I do because my 
mentor in the program told me 
about higher education as a field 
of work,” Siddiqi said. “I didn’t 
know that that could be a thing, 
my parents still don’t know what 
I do in my life, but I have a decent, 
stable job. It’s just opening up those 
avenues and opportunities that you 
didn’t think were initially possible 
because your parents might not 
have had the same experience.”

Panelist Nourel-Hoda Eidy, a 

Public Health junior, said having 
to explain her interests and field 
of study to disapproving parents 
is a unique challenge many first-
generation students face. Eidy, who 
said that she has “very immigrant 
parents,” explained how her family 
is supportive of her studies but still 
remain distant from her life at the 
University.

“My parents still don’t ask 

about school,” Eidy said. “I think 

that for a lot of us it builds a lot of 
autonomy in knowing that I can’t 
complain to my dad about school or 
complain to my mom about school. 
My dad works insane amount of 
hours and is insanely exhausted 
when he comes home. My parents, 
their purpose was, ‘We’re going to 
immigrate, we’re going to provide 
you with the resources, but you’re 
going to figure it out.’”

Hayes 
said 
while 
first-

generation students may struggle 
to keep up with their continuing-
generation peers, they are often 
high-achieving students with a 
strong work ethic and desire to 
succeed.

“I would say don’t doubt us,” 

Hayes said. “I mean, even though 
we might need a little more 
guidance and a little bit more 
patience, we can still accomplish 
really good things. I’m sitting next 
to an amazing group of students 
who have accomplished amazing, 
great things, and I know that we’re 
all really excited for our futures 
and when it comes to that, we are 
equal to students who are not first 
generation.”

this project not to argue with 
anyone. So if someone was 
saying that they believe the 
earth was flat, we just said, ‘Uh 
huh,’ and moved on, which with 
some of those things, it was hard 
at times, but that was what we 
decided to go.”

The film is built on a series of 

reports Bridge published in 
January 2017 that examined 
divides 
that 
exist 
between 

Michigan residents on political, 
economic and social issues. 
Bridge started the project the 
day after the 2016 election, 
following 11 families for a 
year, and reporting on their 

experiences, opinions and hopes 
for the state and the country. 
Six of those people were then 
featured in the documentary.

French said as far as he knew, 

none of the film’s participants 
had changed their point of 
view, adding that a person’s 
source of information was a 
major contributor to the gaps 
that exist between those with 
different 
political 
beliefs. 

French described an instance in 
which a liberal couple from Ann 
Arbor who read The New York 
Times and listened to Michigan 
Radio switched news feeds with 
a conservative man from Troy 
who got most of his news from 
Republican talk radio shows and 
the president’s Twitter feed.

“Frankly I think that’s the 

biggest source of the divide 
that we have,” French said. “... 
They swapped for one week. 
Actually, the conservative, six 
hours into the one-week project, 
he emailed me and said, ‘I’m 
out. I can’t read The New York 
Times anymore. This is too 
crazy stuff.’ I really do think 
that’s something that’s new for 
this generation and I don’t know 
what the solution is gonna be.”

The participants’ reactions to 

the election were also a major 
source of difference. French 
said Dave and Sherri Frohriep, 
a 
couple 
from 
the 
Upper 

Peninsula, stocked up on ammo 
day before the election because 
they 
were 
worried 
former 

Secretary 
of 
State 
Hillary 

Clinton would win, while a 

liberal woman from East Lansing 
named Lisa King stocked up on 
contraceptives in case Trump 
won.

The 
majority 
of 
the 

documentary 
participants, 

regardless of political affiliation, 
listed family as one of their 
top concerns. Public Policy 
graduate students Emma Dolce 
and Aloka Narayanan attended 
the event, and said they were 
not particularly surprised that 
people featured in the film had 
similar values.

“I don’t think it’s necessarily 

an 
issue 
of 
shared 
values 

because people value similar 
things in their lives,” she said. 
“It’s an issue of what policy 
decisions do we want to employ 
enact to those values.”

Narayanan, who is originally 

from California, was interested 
in hearing about the differences 
between Michigan residents. 
She said her initial perception 
was that Michigan was less 
divided than California, but she 
began to think otherwise after 
seeing the film.

“I think that there’s always 

common ground, and that’s 
something that I actually found 
after coming to Michigan,” 
Narayanan said. “I’m liberal, 
and I didn’t have any Republican 
friends 
in 
California 
since 

high school, but coming here 
I realized that I have some 
friends who are moderate and 
have different political opinions 
than I do and I think that there’s 
totally a way to be friends with 
somebody or share values like 
family and have fun together 
and things like that — that’s a 
way to find an in to bridge a gap.”

Dolce, who is from Ann 

Arbor, said living in a liberal city 
can sometimes feel like a bubble.

“I’m pretty heavily invested 

in Michigan politics and local 
politics, and I’ve kind of seen 
divides like this develop for 
a while and I kind of came to 
remind myself of those because 
I think it’s easy to live in the 
bubble of campus and the bubble 
of Ann Arbor,” Dolce said. “It’s 
important to recognize that 
other people have different 
views and different thoughts 
than me and I was curious about 
what those thoughts and ideas 
were.”

Dolce noted the film failed 

to include a participant from 
Detroit, which she said was an 
important perspective to take 
into consideration. Narayanan 
said she wished the film would 
have included more discussion 
of racial divides and equity 
problems, saying that they were 
key factors in the political issues 
that tend to divide people most.

“I wish that there was a little 

bit more of a discussion about 
the racial lines and equity lines 
that divide us because I think 
that that might be able to get 
at the core of ways to have 
conversations that will take us 
to a more positive place to bridge 
the gap,” she said. “We’re talking 
about where we’re different and 
where we have shared values but 
not necessarily the differences 
in our values that come from 
the fact that we have racial 
backgrounds.”

reductions in food stamps, any 
of us who care about any of 
those issues: We will not have 
the voting support of other 
people who care about those 
issues because oftentimes they 
don’t vote, they can’t vote or 
their vote is undermined from 
prison gerrymandering.”

Vincent 
L. 
Hutchings, 
a 

professor in the Department 
of Political Science, spoke next 
and presented his research 
on 
race 
and 
partisanship 

in the South. He began by 
describing the subtleties of 
voter suppression by primarily 
targeting Black people, who 
disproportionately vote in the 
Democratic party.

“We have a very heavily 

racialized 
partisan 
system 

throughout the country, but 
especially 
in 
the 
South,” 

Hutchings 
said. 
“You 
can 

visually 
look 
at 
somebody 

and make a high probability 

estimate as to what party they 
belong to. That is relevant 
because 
if, 
hypothetically 

speaking, 
Republicans 
were 

motivated to prevent Democrats 
from voting, the best way to do 
so is prevent people of color 
from 
voting 
because 
they 

are 
very 
disproportionately 

Democrats.”

The 
third 
speaker, 
Law 

School 
lecturer 
Michael 
J. 

Steinberg, presented his view 
of voter disenfranchisement 
and infringement from the 
viewpoint of his position as 
legal director at the American 
Civil 
Liberties 
Union 
of 

Michigan. 

Steinberg 
referenced 
the 

restriction 
of 
early 
voting, 

restrictions 
with 
absentee 

voting and lack of an option 
to vote a straight-party ticket 
in 
Michigan 
as 
methods 

that 
decrease 
student 
and 

minority voter representation. 
He advocated for initiatives 
like Proposal 3 on the November 
ballot, 
which 
will 
reverse 

many of these procedures and 

make voting more accessible. 
Steinberg added while there is 
criticism of the straight-party 
ticket method of voting, he said 
it will increase voter turnout 
and allow the working class 
more opportunities to vote.

“In a perfect world, people 

would have all the time in the 
world to go through a ballot and 
not worry about the length of 
the line,” Steinberg said. “This 
proposal doesn’t mean that 
people don’t have the option to 
go back, but the precise reason 
that straight party ticket voting 
was eliminated was to suppress 
the vote in Black communities, 
so I think people should have 
the option.”

He also added the importance 

of Proposal 3 in Michigan in 
terms of numbers, claiming 
Michigan would have 400,000 
more voters if Proposal 3 were 
to pass.

Steinberg 
also 

advocated for Proposal 1, which 
would 
legalize 
marijuana, 

which 
could 
prevent 
mass 

incarceration, and Proposal 2, 

which creates a nonpartisan 
commission 
to 
combat 

gerrymandering.

Nursing 
freshman 
Taylor 

Haake 
said 
she 
went 
to 

the 
event 
to 
learn 
more 

about 
contemporary 
voting 

issues, especially in regards 
to 
communities 
that 
she 

personally doesn’t belong to.

“This event stuck out to 

me because I feel like it’s so 
prevalent, especially with the 
election coming up soon, and 
I wanted to be more informed 
about issues I should vote for 
and why they’re important,” 
Haake said. “I’ve always known 
that my vote is important to 
me and that I should be able 
to use it, but I guess I didn’t 
necessarily make connections 
to things in politics that I didn’t 
really understand. I wanted 
to get a better understanding 
of what’s happening in our 
country. A lot of the times 
students can get very involved 
in their own little bubbles, so I 
wanted to break that.”

I wish that there 

was a little bit more 
of a discussion about 
the racial lines and 

equity lines that 
divide us because 
I think that that

and humbled by the level of 
interest 
in 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan, 
here 
in 
the 

state, across the country and 
internationally,” Sanders said 
in the release. “As has been the 
case for many, many years, we 
received applications from far 
greater numbers of qualified 
students than our campus is 
able to accommodate … We rely 
on our holistic review process 
to select students who not 
only have the academic record 
to succeed at U-M, but also a 
strong interest in our university 
and 
connection 
without 

institutional mission and goals.”

With 
University 
financial 

aid, about 26 percent of in-state 
undergraduates are paying no 

tuition this semester, which 
includes around 1,700 students 
who are included in the Go 
Blue Guarantee. This guarantee 
allows in-state students whose 
families earn less than $65,000 
in annual income and who hold 
assets under $50,000 to attend 
the University free of tuition.

In the first year since the 

implementation 
of 
the 
Go 

Blue 
Guarantee, 
admissions 

applications 
from 
some 
of 

Michigan’s 
lowest-income 

household students increased 
by 24 percent. From this, there 
was a 6 percent increase in the 
fall freshman class of students 
whose household incomes are 
$65,000 or less.

“Through 
the 
Go 
Blue 

Guarantee and commitment to 
financial aid, we are sending 
a message to the people of our 
state and beyond that we seek 

to welcome students from all 
communities and backgrounds 
who have the talent and desire 
to be a Michigan Wolverine,” 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel said in the release.

In addition to the Go Blue 

Guarantee, 
the 
number 
of 

undergraduates receiving Pell 
grants has increased to 17.9 
percent from 16.5 percent in 
2014.

According to the Office of 

Enrollment 
Management, 
in 

the fall 2018 freshman class 
45 percent of in-state students 
and 68 percent of out-of-state 
students have family incomes 
of over $180,000. 19 percent of 
in-state students and 15 percent 
of out-of-state students have 
family incomes that are less 
than $65,000. These numbers 
are based on students who 
applied for financial aid, and 

students who did not apply 
for financial aid are included 
in the percentages of those 
whose family income is above 
$180,000.

In terms of underrepresented 

minorities and first-generation 
students, improvements were 
also seen in fall 2018 admissions 
data. Of new freshmen, 14.8 
percent are underrepresented 
minorities, which equals 949 
of 6,403 freshmen who are U.S. 
citizens or permanent residents. 
This percentage is an increase 
from 13.9 percent in 2017 and 10 
percent in 2014.

In 2017, the number of total 

underrepresented 
minorities 

in 
the 
fall 
2017 
freshman 

class increased marginally from 
the 
previous 
year. 
Black 

enrollment 
decreased 

marginally, 
Native 
students 

doubled, Hispanic enrollment 

increased by nearly 1 percent 
and Asian students decreased 
by 2.5 percent.

The report came out during 

the University’s First Gen Week. 
According to a 2016 campus 
climate survey, first-generation 
students make up 8 percent of 
the 
student 
University 

community.

Students who are the first in 

their family to attend a four-
year 
college 
or 
university, 

comprise 14 percent of this fall’s 
freshman class, which is also an 
increase from the 11.3 percent 
total in 2014.

In addition, enrollment of 

transfer students increased this 
year by 14.6 percent. This fall 
159 more students transferred to 
the Ann Arbor campus than in 
2017, and this year there are 16.6 
percent more transfer students 
who 
are 
underrepresented 

minorities than five years ago.

According to Kedra Ishop, 

vice provost for enrollment 
management, improving campus 
and 
enrollment 
diversity 
is 

something the University takes 
into account each admissions 
cycle and strives to continue to 
improve.

The Diversity, Equity and 

Inclusion Plan, the University’s 
program to increase diversity 
in all realms of University 
activity, is now in its third year 
and, according to Ishop, the 
University still has a way to go.

“We’re making progress in 

some areas and face challenges 
in others,” Ishop said in the 
release. “We have to continue 
to find legal solutions to provide 
the opportunity of a Michigan 
education to a diverse set of 
students. We’re not there yet.”

t’s no secret that our 
current political climate 
is becoming exceedingly 
polarized. 
Not 
only 
are 
Democrats shifting left and 
Republicans 
shifting 
right, 
but liberals and conservatives 
alike are witnessing a “rising 
tide 
of 
mutual 
antipathy.” 
While both of these trends 
are undoubtedly contributing 
factors to the hostility of 
today’s 
political 
climate, 
it is really the latter that 
prevents us from escaping this 
seemingly endless stagnation.
Political discourse should 
ultimately be about discussing 
different points of view with 
the intention of walking away 
with a more nuanced or perhaps 
entirely new perspective. But 
nowadays, politics has become 
an almost taboo topic, and 
discourse has been reduced to 
a series of echo chambers and 
unproductive arguments.
With such divisive issues 
dominating 
today’s 
current 
events, it’s easy to fall victim 
to this trap. We all enjoy 
hearing our opinions validated 
by those who agree with us and 
antagonizing those who don’t, 
but it’s time we start thinking 
about what our actions and 
words actually accomplish.
For example, within the 
past month, my Facebook feed 
has been riddled with text 
posts from friends all offering 
their two cents on Justice Brett 
Kavanaugh’s confirmation. My 
immediate reaction when I see 
these posts is almost always to 
cringe. While there is nothing 
inherently wrong with wanting 
to share an opinion with a 
wide audience, these strongly 
worded social media posts are 
simply unproductive — they 
garner support from those who 
already side with the point and 
reinforce the negative opinions 
of those on the opposite side 
of the aisle. Unfortunately, 
this 
type 
of 
discourse 
is 
all too common, and these 
so-called “slacktivists” who 
use social media as a platform 
to express their viewpoints 
have a misguided perception 
that they are making some 
semblance of an impact in the 
world when in reality all they 
are doing is feeding an already 
raging fire.

In civil discourse, rhetoric 
is almost as important as the 
content 
of 
the 
arguments 
themselves. As a liberal, it 
is hard to watch people with 
whom I agree preach their 
opinions 
to 
conservatives 
with such aggressive tactics. 
Regardless of whether their 
points are valid, when liberals 
make personal accusations of 
racism or sexism or attempt 
to nullify their opponent’s 
credibility 
by 
imposing 
politically-charged identities 
like “straight white male,” the 
actual argument, regardless of 
its merits, almost surely goes 
disregarded.
This type of discourse is 
hard to avoid. It’s satisfying to 
outsmart or embarrass others, 
especially when we live in a 
political climate that fosters 
hostility 
toward 
the 
other 
side. But when we discuss 
important 
and 
contentious 
issues like illegal immigration 
or 
Kavanaugh’s 
nomination 
with the primary intention 
of frustrating our opponents, 
when 
we 
treat 
political 
discourse like a tactical game 
rather than a constructive 
discussion, we do so at the 
expense 
of 
the 
important 
issues that deserve healthy 
examination and debate.
During 
the 
2016 
presidential 
race, 
then-
candidate 
Hillary 
Clinton 
made headlines for publicly 
referring to half of then-
candidate 
Donald 
Trump’s 
supporters 
as 
a 
“basket 
of 
deplorables.” 
Many 
viewed this statement as a 
political gift to Trump, as 
the news in the following 
days and, to some degree, 
for the remainder of the 
campaign, 
was 
dominated 
by 
that 
singular 
sound 
bite. 
Meanwhile, 
Clinton’s 
actual 
campaign 
policies 
and initiatives took a back 
seat, and her chances of 
earning any uncertain Trump 
supporters’ votes dwindled to 
practically zero. 
Though the political impact 
of Clinton’s blunder was far 
greater than anything most 
of us could ever individually 
cause, our collective hostility 
toward our political opponents 
is 
equally 
as 
dangerous. 

Clinton made an error in her 
campaign 
that 
the 
greater 
liberal community seems to 
make on a daily basis. She 
extrapolated her perceptions 
of a group of people based 
on their political leanings or 
beliefs.
Today, the term “Trump 
supporter” 
is 
practically 
taboo among liberals. Like 
Clinton, many of us, even if 
only 
subconsciously, 
make 
immediate assumptions about 
this community. But more than 
60 million Americans voted 
for President Trump in 2016, 
and if the left really wants 
to change that number, they 
might want to stop equating 
these 60 million politically 
active Americans with the 
morally depraved.
We tend to forget the 
uncontrollable 
factors 
in 
our 
lives 
that 
inf luence 
our political leanings. I am 
a 
female 
Asian-American 
who grew up in northern 
New Jersey only 45 minutes 
outside of New York City. 
I 
am 
also 
a 
registered 
Democrat who would call 
herself a relatively educated 
voter. That being said, I have 
no idea how I would vote 
had I been born a white male 
in rural America. Factors 
like our gender, education, 
race and place of residence 
are 
not 
only 
powerful 
inf luences, but they are also 
largely beyond our control 
and often taken for granted. 
The American experience is 
amazingly diverse, and we 
should keep this in mind 
when we engage in political 
discourse.
It 
is 
incredibly 
easy 
to 
disregard 
our 
political 
opponents as evil or innately 
wrong, because discrediting 
those with whom we disagree 
is the easiest way to validate 
our own opinions. But if 
we are truly interested in 
making a political impact and 
interested in educating and 
changing those minds which 
are open to change, then we 
must engage in a political 
discourse that fosters that 
mentality.

HANNAH HARSHE | COLUMN

When you can’t do everything
I 
 

grew 
up 
with 
full 
confidence 
that 
I 
am 
capable 
of 
achieving 
anything I put my 
mind to. I have my 
parents to thank for 
that mindset. As a 
little girl, when I came 
stumbling out of my 
bedroom in my footie 
pajamas 
and 
curly 
bedhead, 
whining, 
“I can’t sleep,” my 
dad would invariably 
answer, “Whether you 
think you can or you 
can’t, you’re right.” (A Henry 
Ford quote, by the way.)
In high school, this mindset 
drove my scheduling. If I’m 
capable 
of 
anything 
I 
put 
my mind to, why not take 
notoriously 
difficult 
courses 
like accelerated chemistry and 
Advanced Placement calculus? 
Never mind whether or not I had 
any interest in those subjects. I 
didn’t pretend for a minute that 
I thought I would actually enjoy 
either of those courses. I just 
wanted to challenge myself as 
much as possible.
I’m 
not 
here 
to 
brag 
about my high school course 
load. I would suspect that 
almost every student at the 
University of Michigan has had 
a similar experience, whether 
it was in high school or in a 
different setting. We attend 
this university because we’re 
motivated students who are 
willing to put in the hours to 
get things done. I don’t regret 
taking 
challenging 
courses 
in high school. It’s because of 
them that I learned to work 
hard, even when it’s not fun. 
However, I wish I had been told 
from a younger age that, though 
I can do anything I put my mind 
to, I can’t do everything I put 
my mind to.
Upon 
arriving 
at 
the 
University, I learned the world 
is full of problems and classes 
that are even more challenging 

than AP calculus. Additionally, 
I learned that I’m just not as 
smart as I thought I was. This 
discovery 
many 
of 
the 
University 
students 
I 
know 
had 
— 
to 
push 
myself even harder 
and learn what I’m 
truly 
capable 
of. 
Of course, I didn’t 
have a doubt that 
I was capable of 
everything I put my 
mind to.
I’m 
not 
alone 
in 
this 
instinctive, 
almost 
overwhelming desire to push 
myself too hard. As the Harvard 
Business Review explains, we 
tend to overwork ourselves due 
to a variety of “inner drivers,” 
such as, “ambition, machismo, 

greed, anxiety, guilt, enjoyment, 
pride, the pull of short-term 
rewards, a desire to prove we’re 
important, or an overdeveloped 
sense of duty.” Additionally, 
work (including school work) 
is often less stressful than our 
home lives. Oftentimes, we feel 
lost and out of control in our 
social lives, and working hard 
in school is a chance to prove 
ourselves.
Of 
course, 
it 
doesn’t 
always work like that. Spoiler 
alert: Every single day at this 
university, it becomes clearer 
and clearer that I am not, in 
fact, capable of everything I put 
my mind to.
It’s not that my parents were 
lying to me when they told me 

I can do anything. It’s just that 
I interpreted that “anything” 
to mean everything. I’m sure 
that if I focused on just school, 
or just one job, or just one 
organization, I could be great at 
any of them. But, we live in an 
academic culture that glorifies 
busy schedules and long hours. 
We live in an academic culture 
that glorifies doing everything. 
When you try to be good at 
everything, you won’t be good 
at anything.
I’ve 
experienced 
this 
firsthand, and it’s backed by 
research. The Wall Street 
Journal explains that only 
1 to 3 percent of people can 
sleep five or six hours a night 
without it affecting their work 
performance. Additionally, of 
every 100 people who believe 
that 
they’re 
part 
of 
this 
group, only five actually are. 
The average college student 
gets less than seven hours of 
sleep, so if a student is getting 
a below average amount of 
sleep, it’s highly likely it is 
affecting 
their 
academic 
performance.
Additionally, high levels of 
stress can ultimately lead to 
anxiety, which can drastically 
decrease a student’s academic 
performance. 
According 
to 
Time magazine, “In spring 2017, 
nearly 40% of college students 
said they had felt so depressed 
in the prior year that it was 
difficult for them to function, 
and 61% of students said they 
had ‘felt overwhelming anxiety’ 
in the same time period.”
As students at the University 
of Michigan, we really are 
capable of achieving anything 
we put our minds to. But, when 
we try to turn that “anything” 
into 
an 
“everything,” 
eventually it will turn into 
nothing.

American political discourse needs to change

Liberalism is dead, long live liberalism

HANK MINOR | COLUMN

W

hen the Democrats 
yielded the House to a 
resurgent Republican 
party in 2010, the prevailing 
mood among Democratic party 
members was still one of placid, 
optimistic curiosity: “How will 
Obama and the Senate continue 
steering the ship of state?” Since 
then, their fall from power 
has only accelerated, and the 
GOP delivered a coup de grâce 
to 
the 
movement 
President 
Obama started in 2008 with the 
confirmation of Justice Brett 
Kavanaugh. For the past two 
years, Democrats have managed 
a nearly powerless organization 
— what happens next week, then, 
if they win back the House?
It 
seems 
unfortunately 
possible 
that 
#resisting 
will dominate their agenda, 
preventing 
the 
construction 
of a vision of consensus for 
2020. The Democratic House 
could spend two years trying 
to 
incapacitate 
President 
Trump’s agenda with hearings, 
investigations, 
spending 
cuts 
and general obstructionism, or 
it could methodically lay out 
an alternative for their future 
candidates — I don’t think they 
have the bandwidth for both.
Fortuitously, 
Trump’s 
election 
has 
prevented 
any 
revival of the awful phrase 
“America 
is 
already 
great.” 
Democratic candidates in 2020 
will have to present a case — 
new or not — that the right-wing 
project is inferior to their own. 
It’s easy to be the perpetual 
rebel, never forced to take power 
even when it’s handed to you — 
so easy that savvy politicians 
might opt to avoid doing so 
altogether. 
Dragging 
Trump 
officials 
through 
essentially 
trivial 
House 
investigations, 
motions for impeachment and 
byzantine 
procedural 
rebuke 
isn’t pointless, but it leaves 
open the possibility that the 
prosecution of grievances from 
2016 will overwhelm any attempt 
at progress.
The constant drama of the 
past two years has prevented 
the country from — as many 

voters in both parties hoped 
— “just ignoring politics.” The 
failing New York Times and once 
nearly-defunct Washington Post 
have drastically expanded their 
readership. TV news has slowed 
its march toward obscurity, 
and it seems that social media 
companies are constantly trying 
to capture a piece of the political 
news market. The electorate has, 
happily or not, resigned itself to 
a 24-hour circus. Now people 
are watching, and the left should 
feel compelled to say something 
interesting.
It’s 
possible 
relevant 
politicians will recognize the 
utility of having half a branch 
of government as a weapon 
and will use it in a way that 
supplements the larger project 

of taking back the hundreds of 
seats they’ve lost. This would 
be a strategy borrowed from the 
GOP. The nonsense controversy 
of Benghazi wasted millions of 
dollars and countless hours of 
time — and it helped make Hillary 
Clinton the second-least-popular 
candidate for president ever. 
The scorched-earth war against 
Obamacare was a failure on the 
surface — Obamacare still exists, 
sort of — but it appeared to make 
Clinton wary of championing 
any specific planned legislation. 
She relegated policy detail to her 
website and focused on broadly 
popular 
generalities 
in 
her 
speeches.
The advantage this type 
of strategy has brought to the 
GOP, though, is only maintained 
through sheer force of will. 
Without 
voter 
suppression 
efforts, 
gerrymandering, 
the 

inherent advantage of equal 
representation for states and 
a 
fundraising 
advantage, 
they’d already be losing most 
elections. The left will have 
to 
pair 
ruthlessness 
(which 
they clumsily debuted at the 
Kavanaugh hearings) with a 
genuine 
message 
— 
nobody 
wants a second chance to vote 
for Clinton. Victories in 2018 and 
2020 will rely on the willingness 
of left politicians, like Obama in 
2008, to say something voters 
actually want to hear.
The 
concerted 
effort 
to 
increase 
turnout 
this 
cycle 
is a good sign. It seems the 
Democratic party organization 
might be fully committed to 
inspiring 
non-voters 
rather 
than converting voters whose 
connection to reality has been 
obliterated by Fox News. The 
question is finally, “Why aren’t 
people who like us voting for 
us?” instead of, “Why are people 
who hate us voting for someone 
else?”
It’s likely that less than a 
week from now, Democrats 
will regain legislative power, 
and the power of subpoenas 
and public hearings for the 
first 
time 
in 
four 
years. 
They’ve pursued a watered-
down version of the Tea Party 
strategy following Clinton’s 
loss in 2016: obstruct what 
you 
can, 
and 
fearmonger 
about what you can’t. Taking 
back the House will compel 
them 
to 
pursue 
different 
goals (building a platform 
for their 2020 races, offering 
alternative 
legislation), 
and 
will be the first time since 
2010 that they’ve been asked 
to present a unique vision for 
the country. They might offer 
people a second chance at 
Hillary Clinton — moderation, 
neoliberalism 
and 
social 
progressivism — or they might 
offer something else: policies 
that directly counter Trump’s 
language of “making America 
great again.”

— President Trump in an Axios interview when asked about

my mind to


“Dancing On My Own.” In 
the latter, Robyn watches an 
ex-lover from the corner, begs 
him to see her and ultimately 
dances with sorrow alone. It’s 
a 
crystalline 
encapsulation 

of 
bittersweet. 
When 
she 

wonders, “I’m right over here 
/ Why can’t you see me?” she’s 
asking a question, but it sounds 
like a demand; with that 
demand is the implicit belief 
that a better world might exist 
— that she might deserve the 
right to escape her loneliness. 
As she twirls around on the 
dance floor and looks up at the 
ceiling, she knows what she 
needs and thinks maybe she 
can get it. On “Honey,” Robyn 
learns that the fact of necessity 
has nothing to do with its 

fulfillment.

That’s 
a 
profoundly 
sad 

realization, and it’s easy to 
underestimate the minimal, 
early-morning-hours-in-the-
club production of these songs. 
Robyn says she’s no longer 
an optimist, not like she once 
was. “Things don’t always go 
well, that’s just how it is,” she 
told Pitchfork. What replaces 
optimism is an acceptance 
of love as a viscous fluid, 
something that slips through 
the fingers and falls onto the 
floor with ease, glittering up at 
you from the ground. You can 
still enjoy it, but it’s fleeting.

Robyn is the pop star of 

ambivalence, and the sadness 
comes 
with 
its 
counter. 

“Missing U,” a song about 
loss, sounds like a triumph 
with its carnival synthesizers. 
“Because It’s in the Music” 
is a track to happy-cry to. 
The counter melody makes it 
sound as if it’s moving in two 
different directions, mirroring 
the back and forth of the lyrics 
when she sings, “It’s a tired old 
record / I still play it anyway / 
Because it’s in the music.” On 
“Ever Again,” she describes 
the push and pull of a new 
relationship while declaring 
that she’s never going to be 
broken-hearted again. It closes 
out with the most joyous 
production of the entire album.

And it’s a triumph, too, when 

you consider her newfound 
realization in context. After 
eight years of battling pain 
and loss at the fault of love, 
she doesn’t say that she’ll 
never love again — she says 
she’ll never “hurt” again. She’s 
still taking licks of the sugary 
stuff while she can. She’s just 
dropped 
the 
expectations 

she once had. Gone are the 
questions of “why” that dogged 
her on the Body Talk series and 
her eponymous album. This 
time around, Robyn knows.

Also gone is most of what 

could 
pass 
as 
mainstream 

pop. Opener “Missing U” and 
the title track are as close as 
she gets to pure pop, and even 
these 
sound 
anachronistic 

— not necessarily of the past 
or the future, but of some 
ethereal medium which draws 
from both. There’s ’80s house 
music, ’90s R&B and the 
futuristic synths of “Send to 
Robin 
Immediately.” 
What 

brings it all together is the 
obsession with entrancement. 
To achieve it, Robyn avoids 
simple 
choruses 
and 
the 

predictable drops of EDM. The 
beats wander unexpectedly. 
You have to wait and see 
where they take you, and the 
moments of transcendence are 
almost always a surprise. In 
“Send to Robin Immediately,” 
a discernable beat pattern 
doesn’t emerge until more than 
halfway through the song. The 
tropical “Beach2k20” is in 
no hurry, strolling along for 
six minutes, with pauses for 
swim breaks. Honey rewards 
patience.

Perhaps, 
though, 
the 

greatest achievement of this 
album is that it exists at all, 
and still sounds so essentially 
Robyn. No one else could 
have made this album, and 
despite her reboot, despite the 
trauma, despite the eight-year 
hiatus, with her newfound 
realizations, new software and 
an added calm, the absolute 
joy is that Robyn is — after 
everything — still dancing on 
her own.

When Robyn describes the 

eight-year hiatus she took from 
her solo career, she says that 
she spent the time “rebooting.”

“I 
really 
feel 
like 
I 

rearranged my insides in a 
way,” she told The New York 
Times. Her hard drive was 
wiped clean to make way for an 
entirely new program. Honey 
is our introduction to the new 
software. What we meet is an 
album about resolve, about 
sticking your tongue out to 
taste the sweetness and closing 
your eyes with satisfaction 
because you know not to 

ask for too much more. The 
momentary bliss is enough. 

On the astonishing title 

track (the existence of which 
had been rumored for years), 
Robyn opens in an ascending 

voice, “Baby you’re not gonna 
get what you need / But baby 
I have what you want / come 
get your honey.” A version of 
the song was previewed on 
an episode of HBO’s “Girls” 

in 2017, but was far from 
complete. Robyn reportedly 
spent four years trying to finish 
it, and it became, she says, 
her white whale. The result 
sounds accordingly deserved. 
“Honey” glimmers like liquid 
metal on the dance floor; 
it pulses and churns with a 
wistful determination, the sort 
of contradiction that Robyn is 
so skillful at capturing. Pop 
tastemaker Jack Antonoff, in 
praising her song “Dancing On 
My Own,” describes Robyn’s 
ability to capture apparently 
disparate feelings succinctly, 
like they’re sides of the same 
coin — “this idea… where 
the sadness is sewed into the 
glory,” he wrote.

“Honey” is the sequel to 

The momentary bliss of ‘Honey’

“The Chilling Adventures of 

Sabrina” presents the titular 
teenage witch (Kiernan Shipka, 
“Mad Men”) with what we’re 
told is an impossible choice: 
Should the half-mortal, half-
witch accept her birthright, 
pledge herself to Satan, attend 
a magical school and join the 
Church of Night? Or should 
she keep on living a quiet life 
in Greendale, with friends she 
loves at Baxter High School and 
her doting boyfriend? It’s the 
tension in every adaptation of 
the Archie Comics series: The 
allure of magic perpetually in 
conflict with the adolescent 
desire to fit in.

Watching 
“Chilling 

Adventures,” 
though, 
it’s 

hard to shake the feeling that 
the foul world of the coven is 
really much fairer than our 
own. It’s deliciously morbid, 
enlivened by off-kilter dialogue 
delivered with sinister bravado 
— what language might sound 
like in a minor key. Sabrina’s 
quarrelsome 
aunts 
and 

guardians, Hilda (Lucy Davis, 
“Better Things”) and Zelda 
(Miranda Otto, “24: Legacy”) 
are the best reminder that 
the Church of Night is as fun 
as it is frightening. “Where’s 
Aunt Hilda?” Sabrina’s cousin 
Ambrose 
(Chance 
Perdomo, 

“Killed by My Debt”) wonders 
in the second episode. “She 
annoyed me, so I killed her and 
buried her in the yard,” Zelda 

replies matter-of-factly. A short 
while later, Hilda claws herself 
out of her grave and heads back 
to the kitchen in a huff, saying: 
“You’ve got to stop killing me!”

Resplendent 
with 
classic 

horror influences, the show 
shares some visual DNA with 
fellow gritty Archie Comic 
reboot 
“Riverdale.” 
But 

“Chilling Adventures” is on an 
extra dose of macabre; in the 
third episode, a vampish clique 
of witches helps Sabrina carry 

out a revenge plot that would 
make even Dark Betty blush.

It’s inevitable that the two 

worlds tugging at this heroine 
aren’t quite evenly matched. 
Once we’re given a taste of 
witchhood in all its glory, the 
teenage trials Baxter High 
throws at Sabrina are all a bit 
too pedestrian. Her relationship 
with the dopey Harvey (Ross 
Lynch, “Austin & Ally”) is so 
vanilla, we’re left practically 
begging her to choose Nicholas 
Scratch (Gavin Leatherwood, 
“Grown-ish”), the handsome 
young warlock competing for 
her attention. Sabrina’s mortal 
friends are sweet, but not much 
else. And Sabrina’s principal 
adding “The Bluest Eye” to 

a banned books list, though 
arguably a satanic act in itself, 
doesn’t hold a torch to the 
problems she has involving the 
actual Satan. In the effort to 
keep Sabrina down-to-earth, 
“Chilling Adventures” forgets 
that it’s far more interesting 
when those adventures are 
beneath the Earth.

Shipka’s Sabrina feels akin 

to her comic book predecessor, 
plucky and earnest, as if a 
big smile and can-do attitude 
might just keep the Dark Lord 
at bay. But it’s her mortal 
teenagerness, her disdain for 
authority 
and 
tendency 
to 

question everything, that adds 
some psychological depth to the 
show. The coven is presented 
as a path to empowerment, a 
way for Sabrina to become a 
great, unstoppable witch. But 
really, Sabrina points out, isn’t 
it all just in the service of the 
man down below? What’s so 
empowering about the choice 
between freedom and power?

Being branded a witch, once 

a punishment inflicted by the 
patriarchy, has recently been 
reclaimed as a feminist badge 
of honor — a way for women 
to signal their strength and 
defiance. It’s not so simple in 
the Church of Night, a rigid 
institution filled with the same 
kinds of jockish bullies that lurk 
the halls of Baxter High. “When 
will the world learn?” laments 
Sabrina’s 
possessed 
teacher 

Miss Wardwell (the fabulous 
Michelle 
Gomez, 
“Doctor 

Who”). “Women should be in 
charge of everything.”

“Saturday Night Live”’s 27th 

season premiere was scheduled 
to air just 18 days after the 9/11 
attacks. Reese Witherspoon was 
going to host and Alicia Keys was 
scheduled to perform as musical 
guest; it would be Seth Meyers 
and Amy Poehler’s first show as 
new cast members.

The question loomed over 

the heads of “SNL”’s staff: 
Will the show go on? Creator 
and executive producer Lorne 
Michaels answered that the 
show must go on. At 11:30 p.m. 
EST on Sept. 29, 2001, “Saturday 
Night Live” aired the first 
episode of its 27th season. The 
cold open featured former Mayor 
Rudy Giuliani alongside Lorne 
Michaels. Behind them stood a 
group of New York City’s finest 
— firefighters and police officers 
with uniforms still covered in 
the dust and ashes from Ground 
Zero. Mayor Giuliani spoke about 
the importance of preserving 
New York institutions like “SNL” 
and Michaels asked the question 
we were all thinking, “Can we 
be funny?” Giuliani responded 
with perfect timing, “Why start 
now?”

In a time where calamity 

befalls calamity, I look back on 
this moment in comedy history 
for guidance. In the wake of 
tragedy, can we be funny?

Stephen Colbert said, “You 

can’t laugh and be afraid at the 
same time.” If Colbert believes 
laughter is the best medicine for 
fear, then I believe as well. If fear 
can be cured by laughter, I think 
we should all take a big huff 
of laughing gas every damned 
morning. If fear can be cured by 
laughter, John Mulaney is my 
doctor and he just prescribed 
America with 1000 mg of side-
splitting snickers. If fear can be 
cured by laughter, then the only 
option in fearful times like these 
is to laugh — laugh with friends, 
laugh with family, laugh with 
your roommate, laugh with your 
cousins, aunts, uncles, brothers, 
sisters, laugh with the people 
you hold dear.

In the wake of tragedy, can we 

be funny?

On Saturday night, hours after 

I discovered that 11 of my people 
were murdered in Pittsburgh 
during Shabbat services, I was 
to go on stage and make people 
laugh. My improv group was to 
perform, as we do every month, 
in Angell Hall, in front of an 
audience of our peers. But, now, 
how were we supposed to go on? 

How could we go on stage with 
the purpose of comedy during 
such tragedy? As students lined 
up outside Auditorium A, we 
asked ourselves the question if 

we could be funny. Could we 
really be funny for an audience 
that was just crying? Could we 
really be funny, as natives and 
strangers to Pittsburgh alike, 
for ourselves? In a well-timed 
response, we looked at one 
another and asked, “Why start 
now?”

All of the funds we collected 

from that show will be given 
to the families of the victims 
of the Tree of Life synagogue 

massacre. 
The 
laughter 
we 

created will fund part of a Shiva, 
a funeral, or the rebuilding of a 
temple destroyed by senseless 
hatred.

In the wake of tragedy, can we 

be funny?

If we stop living, laughing and 

loving, fear has won. The show 

must go on. And after we can 
wipe away the tears and look 
towards a better future, we are 
ready to live again; we are ready 
to laugh again.

After a national tragedy, we 

are in a period of mourning as 
a country. Acts of terror remind 
us how much hate there is in 
the world and it is beyond scary. 
Eleven people were murdered 
for being Jewish, and the Anti-
Defamation 
League 
reported 

that it was the deadliest attack 
on Jews in this country. In 
this terrifying time, it helps 
just a little to find the good in 
the world. To remember those 
who helped: the neighbors, the 
community and the brave service 
men and women. Because now 
more than ever, we need good, 
we need love, we need laughter.

In parting, dear reader, I 

offer you several anecdotes that 
never cease to put a smile on 
my face. A few funny lines that 
have circulated around many 
a Shabbat dinner table and 
Passover Seder. Some classic 
Jewish jokes that my uncle 
brings back time and again from 
his box of borscht belt comedy. 
Because we could all use a 
smile right now. Jews believe 
in the sanctity of numbers, and 
three is a good number — three 
patriarchs, three daily prayers 
and 
the 
Kabbalistic 
belief 

that there are three pillars in 
the mystical diagram of the 
Tree of Life. Therefore, I have 
listed three Jewish jokes for 
your laughing pleasure. Also, I 
couldn’t choose just one.

How do you know Jesus was 

Jewish? Four reasons: One, he 
was 30, unmarried and still 
living with his mother. Two, he 
went into his father’s business. 
Three, he thought his mother 
was a virgin. Four, his mother 
thought he was God.

Two elderly women are at 

a 
Catskill 
Mountain 
resort. 

And one of them says, “Boy, 
the food at this place is really 
terrible.” The other one says, 
“Yeah, I know — and such small 
portions.”

Three bubbies are sitting 

on a park bench. The first one 
lets out a heartfelt “Oy!” A few 
minutes later, the second bubbie 
sighs deeply and says “Oy vey!” 
A few minutes after that, the 
third bubbie brushes away a tear 
and moans, “Oy veyizmir!” To 
which the first bubbie replies: “I 
thought we agreed we weren’t 
going to talk about our children!”

Can we be funny?

It is a cool Saturday in late 

Oct. and as most of Ann Arbor 
sleeps, Kerrytown’s Detroit Filling 
Station wakes up with the intent 
of changing the world. As I arrive 
at the activist brunch event, I 
have little idea of what to expect. 
All I know before arrival is that 
the event is a partnership of sorts 
between the owners of Detroit 
Filling Station and the Restaurant 
Opportunities Center of Michigan, 
who are currently advocating 
for the Michigan One Fair Wage 
Campaign. The One Fair Wage 
Campaign is a national campaign 
advocating for better working 
conditions and higher wages for 
restaurant workers around the 
United States. The server-for-an-
hour event held at the Ann Arbor 
restaurant on Oct. 27 was just one 
stop on a tour of public appearances 
across Mich. this past weekend 
featuring actress and activist Jane 
Fonda, Restaurant Opportunities 
Centers United co-founder Saru 
Jayaraman and Black Lives Matter 
co-founder Patrisse Cullors. Also 
at the event was congresswoman 
Debbie 
Dingell, 
former 
state 

legislator Rashida Talib (who is 
running unopposed in Nov. and 
will become one of the first two 
Muslim-American women elected 
to the U.S. Congress) and state 
representative Yousef Rabhi.

Restaurant 
Opportunities 

Center 
co-president, 
Saru 

Jayaraman, educated me further on 
the cause and the current reasoning 
behind their stop in Mich. when she 
gave some opening remarks as the 
event began.

“The Michigan state legislature 

passed the law for a $12 minimum 
wage for tipped employees in the 
state of Michigan, and now they 
are trying to take it off the ballot,” 
Jayaraman said passionately as 
patrons nodded in agreement. Her 
rousing speech had a common 
thread: urging everyone to call 
their senators and condemn the 
removal of One Fair Wage (OFW) 
off the ballot.

The public appearance of these 

celebrities to advocate for OFW 
was well placed at Detroit Filling 
Station — a restaurant that ensures 
the respectful treatment of their 
employees. They make sure to 
provide fair wages, with everyone 
— from dishwashers to servers to 
cooks — making between $14 and 
$19 an hour. Additionally, all who 
work at least 30 hours per week are 
eligible for Michigan’s top-of-the-
line health & dental plan, ensuring 
that employees can cover all of the 
necessary costs of living.

As the event carried on with 

gusto and charisma, I walked 
around and talked to some of the 
customers and local community 
members about what they thought 
of the event, as well as what brought 
them there.

“It is super exciting to be a part 

of something in this community 

dedicated to a fair wage,” said Ann 
Arbor resident Lynn Dils, who was 
enjoying her coffee and waiting 
for the event to begin. “We have 
waitresses in the family, so it’s great 
to be a part of something locally 
that supports them too.”

Many other patrons who I had 

the chance to speak with shared 
her sentiments exactly. There was 
something stirring in the air as 
the diner bubbled with passionate 
discourse between one another.

“I am so excited to be here with 

national celebrities who are lending 
support to a local issue… and it’s 
also my favorite restaurant,” said 
patron Marian Gonsior when asked 
about how it felt to be at an event 
like this in Ann Arbor.

The event was an amalgamation 

between so many different people 
from the Ann Arbor community, 
all sharing a common love for social 
activism and vegan food. It pushed 
people to want to leave the doors 
of Detroit Street and go out and 
spread the word about One Fair 
Wage. Activist and actress Jane 
Fonda, the biggest name on the 
bill, had a lot to say on the topic of 
paying it forward and marching on 
past the doors of Detroit Street, in 
order to really make a difference.

“My former husband (Tom 

Hayden) came from Royal Oak, 
went to the University of Michigan 
and was the editor of The Michigan 
Daily, and he taught me to really 
love this state,” she began when 
she took the microphone to speak 
in front of anxiously awaiting

customers.

“This is a midterm election and 

it is the most important election 
that I’ve ever lived through. If we 
don’t at least take back the House, 
we’re in even more trouble, and 
it’s very important that everyone 
understands to vote down the 
ticket,” she said.

“Call your representatives after 

the election and tell them you will 
not stand for them repealing One 
Fair Wage, or for taking it off the 
ballot,” she finished strongly, before 
introducing co-founder of Black 
Lives Matter, Patrisse Cullors, who 
agreed with and elaborated on her 
sentiments.

“Black Lives Matter has really 

been on the front lines of changing 
the debate and the conversation 
about racial justice in this country 
and also around the world. And 
I think that this particular bill 
really challenges the idea of who is 
deserving and what they deserve. 
We live in a country that has built 
our foundation on who is inferior 
and who is superior,” Cullors said.

“So in our efforts to challenge 

the state and local governments to 
make sure that this bill isn’t gutted 
— it’s going to take everybody in 
this room. It’s going to take all of 
our work, all of our love and all of 
our commitment,” Cullors said. “I 
hope that after today you go home. 
You talk to your family members, 
you talk to your co-workers, you go 
on your social media and you make 
sure that you say that this One 
Fair Wage bill cannot be gutted in 
Michigan.”

With her conclusion, the crowd 

roared in agreement, picking up 
their forks again to finish piles of 
thick vegan pancakes, layered with 
strawberries, whipped rice cream 
and Mich. maple syrup.

I overheard Congresswoman 

Dingell 
expressing 
her 

commitment to being involved and 
present at the local activist events 
over last weekend — including an 
event for domestic violence and 
a breast cancer awareness event. 
Right away, she asked the manager 
of Detroit Street for an apron, so 
that she was ready to serve.

“I can’t just stand here and not 

remind you that we’re 10 days 
away from an election,” she began, 
which elicited a laugh from the 
audience. Many of the speeches 
by the guest servers surrounded 
voter mobilization. In recognizing 
that, for the Democratic Party 
especially, this election is extremely 
important, they emphasized the 
issues of unfair working conditions 
and low wages to bring to light 
the necessity of voting in the 
coming election. They expressed 
repeatedly that the only way One 
Fair Wage will see light on a Mich. 
ballot in the future, and maybe one 
day become a reality, is if everyone 
in the room and beyond goes out 
and votes.

In addition to the myriad of 

celebrities present, Paul Saginaw, 
co-owner of Zingerman’s Deli, 
took the floor to agree with all of 
the previous sentiments and offer 
opinions of his own. Zingerman’s 
is another restaurant that, like 
Detroit Street, treats its employees 
well and stands in support with 
One Fair Wage.

“It is very easy to not be political,” 

he began. This, to me, spoke 
directly to the eligible University 
students who did not vote in the 
2016 
presidential 
election. 
Of 

eligible 
voters, 
approximately 

44.7 percent voted in the election 
according to the National Study of 
Voting, Learning and Engagement 
2016 campus report.

On 
the 
topic 
of 
voter 

mobilization, I was able to talk 
directly with Rashida Talib. She 
is a passionate speaker, an astute 
woman and a fierce individual. She 
expressed how excited she was to 
have a hands-on job serving people 
in the restaurant that morning.

“So many of us march together 

and won’t vote together,” she said 
when asked why voter mobilization 
is so important in young people.

“You are needed,” Talib said. 

“You and your peers have a really 
important role right now in coming 
out and selecting leadership with 
compassion.”

The air was filled with chatter 

and the mouth-watering scent 
of breakfast food as the morning 
progressed. I overheard young 
girls who couldn’t be out of middle 
school declaring they’d be an 
activist at some point in their lives, 
people at neighboring tables sharing 
moments between one another 
and co-owners Phillis Engelbert 
and Joel Panozzo connecting with 
everyone around them, ensuring 
the event was running smoothly.

I had the privilege of stealing 

Phillis Engelbert away from her 
busy life as a restaurant owner 
and activist for a moment to say a 
few words about the restaurant’s 
mission and the event itself.

When 
I 
asked 
Engelbert 

what she and Panozzo thought 
the 
intersection 
between 
the 

restaurant industry and activism is, 
she had a lot to say.

“For us, they go hand in hand. 

My business partner Joel Panozzo 
and I both have histories of social 
activism. So it makes sense that 
we apply a community organizing 
model 
to 
our 
restaurants,” 

Engelbert 
said.“We 
see 
our 

restaurants as resources, to be 
used for building community and 
making social change. We try to set 
an example for other businesses by 
offering our employees a fair wage, 
health and dental benefits, earned 
time off, retirement benefits and a 
fitness bonus.”

Engelbert and Panozzo have a 

commitment to the food they serve, 
but an even bigger commitment to 

the community they foster through 
their restaurants.

“People eat at our restaurants 

monthly, weekly and sometimes 
even daily. We are told time and 
again that we are their favorite 
restaurants. I believe that, yes, our 
food is good, but that is only one 
thing that keeps people coming 
back,” Engelbert said. “The other 
thing is that people feel welcome 
and a sense of belonging here. I 
have been told by some, that they 
were first attracted to Detroit Street 
Filling Station by the rainbow flag, 
hung near our entrance. Others 
have mentioned being comforted 
by our Black Lives Matter signs.”

Clearly, the team at Detroit Street 

is motivated on so many levels of 
social activism and in so many 
different topics, but when asked 
specifically about One Fair Wage 
and how Engelbert incorporates it 
into her businesses, she was very 
passionate and excited.

“We try to stay ahead of the 

curve. 
When 
activists 
were 

pushing for earned sick time, we 
brought them into our restaurants 
and helped them collect petition 
signatures. And we began offering 
it to our employees,” Englebert said. 
“For us, One Fair Wage is do-able, 
and it’s the right thing to do.”

After attending such a riveting 

event, I was curious when I could 
come back on my own accord to 
taste more of this activism and 
vegan food fusion. I inquired what I 
could expect in the near future, so I 
could mark my calendar, tell all my 
friends and make the trek over to 
Detroit Street for some gluten-free 
Tater Tots and social advocacy.

“You can expect bold new 

directions in vegan cooking, a 
continued lineup of great music, 
expanded 
opportunities 
for 

activism — buses to the women’s 
march in DC anyone? — possibly a 
mural, a vegan Thanksgiving Feast 
on Nov. 20 and a New Orleans-
themed New Year’s Eve Dinner 
Party,” Englebert said. “Everyone 
needs a good party, right? As Emma 
Goldman said: ‘If I can’t dance, 
I don’t want to be part of your 
revolution.’”

That sentiment certainly rang 

true at the event on Saturday. 
Though a lot is at stake in the 
coming elections for many people 
and the issues at hand are severe 
and life-changing for large groups, 
everyone was able to be light-
hearted, silly at times and overall 
just excited to try and make a 
change. Their positive attitudes 
and spirited words mingled with 
the great food, warm environment 
and strong sense of community 
etched in the walls of Detroit Street. 
It may seem unconventional for you 
to enjoy a side of social activism 
with 
your 
Saturday 
morning 

brunch, but I urge you to head over 
to Kerrytown and try it — at Detroit 
Street. It just makes sense.

It’s the ‘Great Pumpkin’

Halloween at 19 and Halloween 

at nine are two very different 
experiences: Costumes tend to be 
a little more revealing and, while 
some of us still go door-to-door, 
we’re looking for a party instead 
of candy from a neighbor. Some of 
us might take on the adult role of 
passing out the candy or even skip 
celebrating altogether to study or 
work. Yet despite these seemingly 
glaring differences, “It’s the Great 
Pumpkin Charlie Brown” serves 
as a reminder of the wholesome 
Halloween fun that accompanies 
the holiday, whether or not you’re in 
the third or 13th grade. 

“The 
Peanuts” 
Halloween 

special, in which Linus spends 
a night in a pumpkin patch and 
Charlie Brown finally gets invited 
to a party, is surprisingly similar to 
the way Halloween plays out here 
at the University. Most obviously, 
the characters are all just a bunch 
of kids who think they know what 
they’re doing but, in actuality, 
have no idea what’s happening. 
Whenever an adult voice of reason 
tries to interfere with their fun — 
looking at you Schlissel — all we 
hear is a muffled garbling that really 
makes no sense. 

But it goes even further than 

that. Take Charlie Brown for 
example: 
His 
consistent 
hope 

that someday, somehow, he is 
finally going to kick that football 
is the same kind of naïve dream 

that all of us carry into game day 
(only to watch Michigan fumble 
somewhere critical or miss a field 
goal). Charlie Brown’s unexpected 
invitation to a Halloween party, and 
his subsequent joy, is the same kind 
of feeling we all got when Michigan 
actually 
beat 
Michigan 
State. 

Unfortunately for Charlie Brown, 
the similarities don’t stop there; his 
night of trick-or-treating is brought 
down by the fact that instead of 
getting all the candy he could ever 
dream of, he gets rocks. Similarly, 
my expectations for going out on 
any night far exceed what actually 
happens and more often than not, 
I end up dead asleep by midnight 
regretting my decision to even go 
out at all. 

Lucy, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 

encompasses the person bent on 
having a good time and who is 
baffled when anyone seems to 
think there’s anything to do other 
than party on Halloweekend. Her 
criticism of Linus waiting for the 
Great Pumpkin carries the same 
kind of disappointed tone I might 
hear from friends as I say no to the 
frats or when I leave at 11:45 p.m. 
to go hop in bed. She might even 
call me a blockhead on my way 
out. Snoopy is that one person that 
gets so into their costume and their 
character — I have to wonder why 
they aren’t in SMTD; his World War 
II flying ace costume is elaborate 
and detailed, down to his dog house 
as the plane. There are people in 
this world, and on this campus, 
who go to the same extremes. I just 
can’t help but think about the time 
it would take to come up with a 

quality costume and execute it well. 
I can barely do that with homework. 

I will also proudly admit that I 

am Linus and that I have, in fact, 
carried a security blanket around, 
which I will shamelessly take 
to class and lecture. Linus also 
happens to be that person who 
insists on doing something other 
than partying and talks excessively 
about these different plans. In our 
21st century case, I would liken it to 
posting it on Instagram. He writes 
a letter to the Great Pumpkin; I’ll 
post a picture of myself studying 
at Espresso Royale on a Saturday 
night. 
Interestingly 
enough, 

whether someone is waiting for the 
Great Pumpkin or studying for a 
good midterm grade, both rely on a 
healthy level of sincerity that Linus 
and I both don’t have. 

Charlie Brown and Linus always 

also have their little chats on a brick 
wall — in “Great Pumpkin” the two 
recap Halloween night, discussing 
the highs and the lows of trick-or-
treating and the disappointment 
of 
the 
Great 
Pumpkin. 
This 

whole segment of the cartoon is 
reminiscent of the morning after 
brunches we all go to with our 
friends while ignoring whatever 
responsibilities we may or may not 
need to address in the near future. 

This Halloween, make sure you 

watch, or re-watch, “It’s the Great 
Pumpkin Charlie Brown.” Whether 
you do it while pregaming a house 
party or baking a pumpkin pie with 
your mom, just remember to never 
jump into a pile of leaves with a wet 
sucker and always get your signed 
documents notarized.

The University of Michigan just 
scored an “F” on racial equity in 
a public university study. And 
since we are in the spirit of writ-
ing guides, I thought it would 
only be right to create a guide 
where a Black student attempts 
to educate their peers on how to 
be a little more civil and cultur-
ally competent.
I write this to the incoming col-
lege student, and anyone who 
might’ve gotten too much expo-
sure to Fox News. I write this to 
all of the racist, sexist, bigots in 
the classroom and around cam-
pus. I write this to the parents 
who failed miserably to educate 
their pasty-ass kids in their lily-
white neighborhoods. I write 
this to the professors who’ve 
essentially told me that they’re 
sorry, but I need to sit down, 
shut up, and deal with it. I write 
this as solace — in solidarity to 
those who have had to put up 
with too much for too long from 
their oppressors.

How to not be racist: a starter guide for UM 

Basics/101- (Shit You Should Know, But Your Parents Probably Failed to Learn and Teach You)

Common Myths that derail actual conversations on racism

MYTH 1: The Irish were 

slaves, too. You don’t see me 
complaining. 

The Irish were never slaves. 
“While it is true that anti-

Irish sentiment was present in 
the United States until well into 
the 20th century, but that is a 
separate issue from 17th century 
indentured servitude,” Leslie 
Harris, a professor of African-
American history at Northwestern 
University, said. “The descendants 
of indentured servants, Irish or 
otherwise, did not face a legacy 
of racism similar to the one faced 
by people of African descent.” 
Harris also notes “an indenture 
implies two people have entered 
into a contract with each other 
but slavery is not a contract . . . It 
is often about being a prisoner of 
war or being bought or sold bodily 
as part of a trade. That is a critical 
distinction.”

MYTH 2: Asians are able 

to pull themselves up by their 
bootstraps — why can’t you all?

Asians are not, and have 

not, been subjected to the same 
complex and purposeful systems 
that were built to oppress Blacks. 

Let me emphasize: Asians 

definitely were (and are) 
discriminated against. There 
were lynch mobs, housing 
discrimination, internment camps 
and immigration quotas to oppress 
Asian people. But the system that 
oppressed Blacks has been here 
longer, was enforced more brutally 
and has remained to this day. 

Let us not forget: Asians were 

not subjected to as heavily as 
a community to slavery, black 
codes, segregation, redlining, 
ghettos, police brutality and prison 
systems. And let’s remember that 
stereotypes cast Asians as smart 
and workaholics, while Blacks are 
portrayed as lazy, dangerous and 
dumb. These stereotypes can cost 
jobs, opportunities and even lives.

The struggles that Asians and 

Blacks went, and continue to go 
through, are completely different. 
Asians came over mostly as willing 

economic migrants or as refugees 
fleeing war. Blacks were forcefully 
taken from their homelands to 
work as slaves.

3. MYTH: I am not 

responsible for my ancestors’ 
ills. 

Yes, yes you are. Whether 

your ancestors owned slaves 
and exploited their labor to 
gain familial wealth, or you are 
simply white, you are benefitting 
from a system created to help 
you succeed. Most recently, the 
history of immigration law, civil 
rights law, and this country at 
large has one people’s history at 
large. Name one law that helped 
Black people that wasn’t undoing 
some shit white people did. 

You benefit from their ills every 

day. 

As Jeanne Curran, a emeritus 

faculty member at California 
State University-Dominguez 
Hill campus wrote, “When past 
actions, such as colonialism and/
or slavery, exploited some and 

privileged others, the exploitations 
and privileges became part 
of our system of law through 
the unstated assumptions of 
privilege. The law was created 
by the privileged, and so 
reflects their perspective to the 
exclusion of the perspective of 
those colonized, enslaved, or 
exploited. To the extent that 
we continue to take advantage 
of the unstated assumptions of 
privilege on which our current 
system is based, we continue to 
bear responsibility for the effects 
those unstated assumptions have 
on people harmed by them.” She 
goes on to say, “Institutional 
racism is racism that arises 
from the rules and normative 
structure of social interaction 
in personal relationships and in 
institutions, rather than from any 
discriminatory or racist intent of 
an individual perpetrator. In other 
words, some acts of discrimination 
and racism occur because 
someone, operating on racist 
or discriminatory assumptions 

and beliefs, intends to exclude or 
harm a specific group or person. 
But other acts of discrimination 
and racism occur simply because 
‘that’s the way we do things,’ or 
because ‘we’re just following the 
rules.’”

MYTH 5: Get over it. Slavery 

was so long ago. 

Lol. See figure 5 in the online 

version.

For more on why you shouldn’t 

blame Black people for what you 
did to them. 

 
MYTH 5: Africans were 

complicit, and sold other Blacks 
into slavery. 

Africans and Europeans 

had different definitions and 
understandings of what a slave 
was, so don’t even start with 
“Africans were complicit in the 
slave trade” when there is little 
evidence to support that they did 
understand the totality of what 
they were doing.

“Why is it so easy for white 

people to fix their barely-there 
lips or curl their fingers to tell 
people of color to leave the 
country if they don’t like it?

I wanna ask them why 

they don’t leave? Most, if not 
all, white people know their 
lineage. So why not go back to 
where they came from? After 
all, their ancestors chose to 
come here. Mine were stolen 
from Africa.” — WOC Allies

White people have been 

saying “Go back to your 
country” for ages, even though 
they all should be the first to 

leave. You stole this country 
from Native Americans. You 
committed genocide to keep 
it. You profited off Black and 
people of color’s labor for 
centuries to build this nation. 
You even created immigration 
loopholes to benefit from 
cheap labor. See: the Bracero 
Program. And now you want 
us to leave, so you can reap 
all the benefits? Further, 
many racists assert that if 
you acknowledge how racism 
affects you, a community 
or any social or political 
interaction, you are playing 

the victim. 

I’m here to tell you — that’s 

categorically false. 

If someone stabs you, do you 

just say, “Oh, it’ll heal itself”? 
Acknowledging institutional 
racism exists isn’t antithetical 
to social progress. 
Acknowledging wrongdoing 
is the healthiest way to move 
on and repair damage that has 
been done to communities for 
centuries. 

Someone is not a victim 

for acknowledging what has 
happened to them. 

Racism is not over. It is built 

into the fabric of American 
society — into how suburbs, cities, 
education systems, income levels 
and every single tier of existence 
are created. This system, which 
has been fashioned in America over 
centuries, is far too complex to be 
broken down in this starter guide. 
But to be fair, let’s look at just a few 
recent statistics on discrimination.

Blacks and whites in Educational 

Attainment:

As you can see from the data in 

figure 1, Blacks and Hispanics are 
enrolling more in college than ever 
— but why are they conferring less 
bachelor’s degrees? 

Spoiler alert: It’s not because 

they’re lazy. Maybe it’s due to the 
institutional barriers they’ve been 
facing since they were children. 

The idea of education being the 

great equalizer is a tall tale at best. 
The “American dream” is largely 
dead. And even though exceptions 
exist, social mobility has remained 
stagnant and even decreased over 

the past 30 years. 

In Harvard’s “Civil Rights 

Project,” “Lee and Orfield identify 
family background as the most 
influential factor in student 
achievement. A correlation exists 
between the academic success of 
parents with the academic success 
of their children. Only 11% of 
children from the bottom fifth earn 
a college degree while 80% of the 
top fifth earn one.” 

Maybe institutional and 

generational wealth has something 
to do with all of this, because

“But I’m not racist! I don’t see 

race! I’m colorblind.”

In any conversation about race 

in modern America, resorting to 
“colorblindedness” is a defense 
mechanism in order to avoid 
talking about race because you 
“don’t see it.” 

“But then what do you do at a 

stop light?” — Trevor Noah

Put bluntly in the words 

of writer Hayley Burroughs, 
colorblindedness does the 
following: 

“It denies cultural heritage and 

negative racial experiences.

It fails to acknowledge the 

racial construction of whiteness 
and supports systems of privilege 
and oppression.

It discourages people from 

acknowledging the racism they 
face.

It views racism at the 

individual level without looking at 
the larger societal, institutional, 
and structural mechanisms in 
which racism operates.

It assumes we live in a country 

where race no longer matters, 
even though is still a major issue.

It invalidates people’s 

identities.

It narrows white people’s 

understanding of the world, 
disconnecting them.”

We all see color, or, more 

importantly, are capable of 
understanding that someone’s 
race affects how they move 
throughout the world. We know 
that obtaining money/resources 
does not alleviate racial struggle. 
As a result, colorblindedness 
ideology encourages and fosters 
racism, as it fails to recognize the 
economic, political and social 
differences within race. 

Racism is alive and well in 

America. And it’s not going away 
anytime soon. 

Racism is not just being a part of 

the Ku Klux Klan. Racism is also an 
attitude, in which you would prefer 
not to get involved with issues of 
race, or understand how race works 
and operates to keep minorities 
around you disenfranchised. Racism 

is putting your own comfort over 
the lives of the marginalized and 
oppressed. 

In America, you have two options 

when it comes to racism: 

1. Ignore all of this, and continue 

perpetuating the problems. 

OR
2. See exactly how this is, fight 

against it and stand up to it. 

Sitting and repeating “I’m not 

racist” does absolutely nothing to 
change racism. And pretending that 
you do not see it definitely does not 

change anything. 

I am tired of sitting in a class full of 

white racist students who have done 
nothing to educate themselves on 
how race works and operates in this 
country. 

Their “opinions” work to maintain 

the status quo and actively endanger 
my livelihood.

I wrote this so that you can be 

better, and so that this country doesn’t 
have to fall for the same reasons Rome 
did: the failure to incorporate people 
of different backgrounds into society. 

Blacks and whites in 

Unemployment: 

 
“In 1954, the earliest 

year for which the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics has consistent 
unemployment data by race, 
the white rate averaged 5% and 

the black rate averaged 9.9%. 
Last month, the jobless rate 
among whites was 6.6%; among 
blacks, 12.6%. Over that time, the 
unemployment rate for blacks has 
averaged about 2.2 times that for 
whites.” - PEW Research Center

Is it clear yet? 
Disparities between whites and 

Blacks exist. Racism is alive and 
well. 

“Victim Mentality”/ “Victimhood”/ “If you don’t like it here, then leave!”
Colorblindness

Racism Is Over

people of color haven’t had 

access to the “old boys network,” 
or nepotistic practices — those 
white people have had to keep 
their wealth insulated for years. 

Blacks and whites in Household 

Income: 

The data in figure 2 show 

that there is around a $30,000 
income disparity between the 
median Black household income 
and the median white household 
income. 
Spoiler alert: it’s not 

that the Blacks are lazy!

 “In 2016, the most recent 

year for which all of these data 
are available, the median black 
worker earned 75 percent of what 
the median white worker earned 
in an hour; the median black 
household earned 61 percent of 
the income the median white 
household earned in a year; and 
the value of net worth for the 
median black family was just 
10 percent of the value for the 
median white family. Related 
to these relative proportionate 
differences is also a wide range 

of absolute differences. While 
median hourly wages vary 
by a few dollars ($14.92 for 
black workers, $19.79 for white 
workers), the difference in median 
household income is tens of 
thousands of dollars ($39,490 
for black households, $65,041 
for white households), and the 
difference in median family net 
worth is hundreds of thousands of 
dollars ($17,600 for black families, 
$171,000 for white families).” -

Facing McSorley, Michigan looks for redemption

After allowing season highs of 
506 yards and 42 points to Penn 
State in last season’s blowout, the 
Michigan football team’s defense 
can seemingly rest easier. This 
Saturday, it doesn’t have to line 
up across some of the threats 
that keep defensive coordinator 
Don Brown up at night.
There is no whiteout crowd 
in Happy Valley, no DaeSean 
Hamilton 
or 
Mike 
Gesicki 
running the sidelines and, most 
notably, no Saquon Barkley to 
gash the Wolverines’ defense.
But 
some 
teams 
have 
indescribable 
characteristics 
that 
can 
cause 
fits. 
The 
14th-ranked Nittany Lions are 
one of them.
“They don’t have Saquon, 
but they’re still Penn State,” 
said 
redshirt 
sophomore 
defensive tackle Carlo Kemp. 
“They’re still super successful, 
super dangerous and they’re a 
couple plays away from being 
undefeated.”
And in Penn State quarterback 
Trace McSorley, No. 5 Michigan 
will still face off against an 
offensive weapon it had no 
answers for last year.
McSorley threw for 282 yards 
and a touchdown in last year’s 
game, but carried the ball 11 
times for 76 yards and three 
touchdowns. Sure, Barkley and 
the headaches he presented are 
now in the NFL. But running 
back 
Miles 
Sanders 
and 
McSorley are still executing run-
pass-options as well as anyone in 
the country.
With a chance at redemption, 
the 
defense’s 
success 
is 
contingent on stopping McSorley.
“Terrific 
player,” 
said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“Consistently plays really well. 
Always is a threat in the passing 
game, defending the passing. 
He’s running the ball a lot more 
this year, really effectively. He’s 
quite a quarterback. Their win-
it factor shows up over and over. 

Big challenge for our team this 
week.”
With junior linebacker Devin 
Bush Jr. likely spying McSorley 
and a weaker run game (read: 
not the best in the country), the 
Wolverines could see a more 
balanced, but still explosive 
offense.
“They got some key guys that 
they like to go to,” said junior 
safety Josh Metellus. “Like No. 
1, KJ (Hamler), he’s a fast guy, 
he creates space well himself 
and he has acceleration to take a 
five-yard play to an 80-yard play. 
And then on the outside they’ve 
got No. 84 (Juwan Johnson), 
we know he’s a good deep ball 
threat and a possession guy too. 
If they need a third-and-nine, 
they’ll go to him on a curl route 
or something.”
And like any powerhouse 
offense, it all runs through it’s 
quarterback.
“He keeps plays moving with 
his feet, extending plays really 
well,” Metellus continued, “and 
that’s one of those things that 

— as a defensive back in man 
coverage — you don’t want the 
play to extend because now you 
cover your man for six seconds 
instead of three or four. That’s 
what makes their passing attack 
hard to defend.”
Michigan 
has 
played 
quarterbacks that are also light 
on their feet this season. Notre 
Dame’s 
Brandon 
Wimbush, 
Nebraska’s 
Adrian 
Martinez 
and 
Michigan 
State’s 
Brian 
Lewerke all fit that bill, with only 
Wimbush finding any semblance 
of success. McSorley will be 
the most decisive and quick 
quarterback it will see all year.
The Wolverines’ defense is 
boiled down to manning an 
assignment on a given play. It’s 
simple enough in practice, but 
failure in execution could be the 
difference between a stop and a 
touchdown.
“Just making sure you read 
your keys properly,” Kemp said. 
“Make sure you do your job, don’t 
try to do too much. If you have 
the quarterback, make sure you 

have the quarterback, because if 
you don’t, then you’ll look at him 
going that way.”
Kemp, whose face briefly 
shifted from a smile to a 
concerned 
look, 
pointed 
behind his back. He, and the 
whole Michigan defense, saw 
themselves 
chasing 
Barkley 
and McSorley often against the 
Nittany Lions a year ago.
Brown was adamant that last 
year’s defensive performance 
keeps him restless. Metellus 
knows he’s telling the truth, 
because he feels the same. Their 
frustration extends from a loss, 
and exposing a highly-touted 
defense.
Beyond that, feeling helpless 
is something Michigan’s defense 
has rarely confronted.
“I’m sure everyone on the 
defense felt they could’ve done 
something to improve the output 
of the game,” Metellus said.
With a second chance to tackle 
McSorley, the defense doesn’t 
need much more motivation than 
that.

Mann to continue receiving opportunities

Two is better than one.
Last 
season, 
then-
sophomores Jack LaFontaine 
and Hayden Lavigne split time 
at goaltender for the first half 
of the season until Lavigne 
wrestled away control of the 
starting job.
Though Lavigne retains a 
hold on the position through the 
first five games of the season, 
the emergence of freshman 
goaltender Strauss Mann has 
provided the Michigan hockey 
team (3-2) with a viable second 
option. Even after Lavigne 
recorded a shutout on Friday 
against St. Lawrence, Mann 
received the nod the following 
evening. And for Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson, having two 
good netminders is better than 
one.
“(Lavigne)’s 
a 
good 
goaltender,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“It’s nice to have one really 
good goaltender, but it’s even 
better to have two really good 
goaltenders. So, I just wanted to 
make sure Strauss got in.”
In Pearson’s time as an 
assistant for the Wolverines, the 
team would traditionally ride 
one goaltender, including Scott 
Sharples, Steve Shields and 
Marty Turco. Last season was 
a bit of an anomaly for Pearson 
who was getting a feel for his 
two sophomore goaltenders in 
his debut season 
as head coach for 
Michigan. Now 
in 
his 
second 
season 
at 
the 
helm, 
Pearson 
has a freshman 
in Mann who 
has 
shown 
the 
ability 
to 
provide quality 
play 
in 
the 
crease.
Mann allowed only one goal 
on 19 shots in Saturday’s 3-1 
victory after showing some 
signs of struggle in a 5-4 loss 
at 
Western 
Michigan 
last 
weekend.
“I wanted to get Strauss 
in and just to get him a home 
game,” Pearson said. “We sort 

of threw him into the deep end 
right off the bat at Western 
Michigan, it’s a tough place to 
play and I just wanted to get 
him a home game ... And I want 
some competition.”
As 
for 
Mann, 
the 
competitiveness 
between 
himself 
and 
Lavigne 
only 
drives him to be 
better.
“As a goalie, 
there’s only one 
guy 
that 
can 
be in the net at 
a time,” Mann 
said. “So that’s 
something 
I’ve 
really 
had 
to 
deal 
with 
my 
whole career so that’s nothing 
new. Everyone is just trying 
to play their best when they’re 
in the net and that’s just been 
my approach. When I get my 
chance just do what I can do 
and hopefully things will work 
out in the long run.
“I think the best goalies 

are really competitive, and I’d 
like to think I’m competitive 
as well. We both know we’re 
friends off the ice, so anything 
that happens on the ice is just 
hockey and just competing and 
at the end of the day just looking 
to make each other better. 
So, no one ever 
takes offense to 
anyone wanting 
to 
stop 
pucks 
or 
getting 
competitive 
on 
the ice, it’s just 
the nature of the 
game.”
Lavigne 
will 
likely 
continue 
to 
receive 
the 
majority of the 
time between the pipes. But 
with Big Ten play beginning 
next 
Friday 
against 
Notre 
Dame, Pearson knows that he 
may have to ride the hot hand if 
one goaltender stakes a claim to 
that level of success.
Thus 
far, 
both 
Lavigne 
and Mann have put up nearly 

identical 
numbers 
in 
three 
and two regular season starts, 
respectively. Lavigne has a 
3.04 
goals 
against 
average 
with a .864 save percentage, 
while Mann has a 3.07 goals 
against average and a .860 save 
percentage.
Though he’s 
currently 
the 
clear 
backup 
now, 
Mann 
embraces 
the 
opportunity 
to 
continue 
to improve on 
and off the ice 
and earn more 
playing time.
“(Lavigne 
and I) have a 
really good relationship and 
definitely 
push 
each 
other 
on and off the ice. We have a 
good line of communication 
and 
definitely 
talk 
about 
goaltending a lot and how we 
can make each other better 
and push each other. It’s been a 
good relationship so far.”

Karan Higdon takes 
on leadership role

After the Michigan football 
team’s last game, a 21-7 win 
over Michigan State, there 
was a lot to talk about.
So when Karan Higdon 
sat in the visitors’ press 
conference room at Spartan 
Stadium, 
he 
was 
asked 
about pregame antics and 
motivation and doubters. The 
senior running back had an 
answer ready.
“Every 
week, 
it 
seems 
that people, with the playoff 
rankings or whatever it may 
be, find a reason to critique 
us 
about 
why 
we 
don’t 
deserve to be a top-ranked 
team,” Higdon said. “Last 
week it was we don’t show 
up in big games. This week, 
it’s Michigan State’s got the 
No. 
1-ranked 
defense. Blah, 
blah, blah. We 
showed up and 
we did our job. 
That’s all that 
matters, 
and 
that’s what it 
is.”
Higdon was 
positioned 
in that press 
conference 
between 
sophomore 
wide 
receiver 
Donovan Peoples-Jones and 
junior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson. He answered a 
majority of the questions 
during 
the 
presser, 
and 
he 
gave 
calm, 
confident 
responses.
When the three players 
stood up afterward, Peoples-
Jones and Patterson smiled at 
Higdon, giving him high-fives 
and handshakes before they 
exited stage right. The game, 
and Higdon’s words, seemed 
to have pumped them all up.
Higdon was named captain 
before the season, and he 
exudes the confidence of one, 
both in front of 
the media and 
elsewhere.
When 
the 
Wolverines beat 
the 
Spartans, 
and Wisconsin 
before 
that, 
they sealed the 
games on the 
ground, feeding 
Higdon 
over 
and over and 
bludgeoning 
the opposing defense into 
submission. 
He 
is 
the 
workhorse of the offense.
On 
Monday, 
facing 
the 
media for the first time since 
East Lansing, Higdon said he 
feels he has always run with 
an aggressive, downhill style. 
What he has been trying to 
develop this season, is his 
leadership skills.
“Being 
more 
vocal,” 
Higdon said. “Holding guys 
to a higher standard, making 
sure we’re all on the same 
page and that I’m not just 
playing and leading through 
my play, but being vocal and 
making sure that guys are on 
top of their stuff, keeping that 
focus, keeping that higher 

energy.”
The ability to be a vocal 
leader and a strong performer 
go hand-in-hand, though.
If Higdon wasn’t leading 
the team with 831 yards 
and six touchdowns on the 
ground, if he hadn’t taken 
nearly the entire workload 
after junior running back 
Chris Evans went down with 
an injury, or if he hadn’t put in 
work off the field to become 
Michigan’s bell cow, his voice 
wouldn’t have a place on the 
team in the first place.
But he has done all those 
things, and his voice does hold 
water with the Wolverines.
“(Higdon) has been getting 
a bulk of the carries these last 
eight weeks, and you can tell 
he knows he’s a leader,” said 
junior safety Josh Metellus. 
“He knows guys look up to 
him, and he’s 
taken that with 
a high head and 
like, 
‘Alright, 
if people want 
me to be the 
leader, I can 
be the leader.’ 
You know, he’s 
speaking 
up. 
Whatever 
he 
doesn’t 
like, 
he says it. Or, 
you know, if he 
wants to talk to the team, give 
us some encouragement, he 
does. Everybody really listens 
to him.”
Added redshirt junior left 
tackle Jon Runyan: “Karan’s 
a guy that’s not afraid to call 
anybody out. When guys are 
slacking, missing a block or 
not catching the ball, having 
him, knowing that he has your 
back even when he says that 
stuff, it’s very nice. Karan’s a 
great dude. Everybody loves 
him, rallies around him, and 
it’s great having him out there 
with us.”
To Runyan, the way Higdon 
has earned respect is the 
same thing he 
expects 
from 
those 
around 
him. He calls 
people 
out, 
because 
he 
wants them to 
work as hard 
as he does.
From 
Higdon’s 
perspective, 
that likely has 
more 
to 
do 
with the constant push to get 
Michigan to its highest level 
of performance.
For his teammates, though, 
Higdon’s respect for them 
means something, too.
“For Karan, it’s coming 
in, doing your job, working 
hard 
every 
day,” 
Runyan 
said. “Don’t get too boastful 
about yourself, and you’ll 
eventually earn his respect. 
I think I’ve definitely done 
that. Everyone on the offense 
has done their part to earn 
that, and that’s something 
really special when a type of 
player like Karan’s caliber, 
you earn his respect.”
The 
feeling 
is 
almost 
definitely mutual.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | OCTOBER 31, 2018

Why should we care about the 
University’s forgotten Detroit roots?

ILLUSTRATION BY CHRISTINE JEGARL


A 

few days ago, I saw 
a 
man 
rollerblading 

while pushing a stroller 

with a golden retriever trailing 
behind on a leash. The spectacle 
looked like an American Ninja 
Warrior audition. As I watched 
the feat from across the street, I 
considered the skill of this man 
completing his Saturday morning 
to-do list while balancing on 
eight wheels.

In that moment, I came to two 

conclusions. First, his dedication 
to exercise seemingly convinced 
him that rollerblading while 
responsible for the livelihood 
of a baby and a dog was a good 
idea. And secondly, my own 
coordination will likely never 
surmount to the athleticism 
required to complete such an 
act. Not that I am disappointed, I 
can certainly think of a lot better 
things to do with my weekend 
than fall face first on a pothole-
ridden road.

I 
have 
never 
categorized 

myself as naturally athletic. You 

know, one of those people who 
can effortlessly recall their days 
as a three-sport athlete and win 
Spikeball the first time they play. 
The one sport I played in high 
school was swimming, which I 
had grown up participating in. 
And like anything, once you spend 
10 years practicing something, 
it is reasonable to expect your 
ability to hover around at least 
average.

The only biological evidence 

I have of my athletic ability was 
when a nurse told me that my low 
blood pressure suggested I spent 
a lot of time holding my breath. I 
guess swimming with your face 
in the water for a decade does 
something to your body beyond 
pruney fingertips. 

So I don’t have the blood of a 

track star. But I did not need a 
doctor to tell me that. The sheer 
number of times I have stubbed 
my toe while walking around 
the house or didn’t catch the 
beach ball during icebreakers is 
probably enough empirical proof.

My lack of natural athletic 

ability was confirmed in seventh-
grade gym class — arguably, an 
experience specifically designed 
to test the resilience of fragile 
13-year-old 
self-esteem. 
I 

dreaded having to don the cotton 
uniform and break a sweat to the 
Black Eyed Peas and Lady Gaga 
dance party anthems found on 
any middle schooler’s iPod Nano 
in 2012. The crown jewel of my 
gym teacher’s curriculum was 
the track and field unit. We were 
required to complete every event 
for a grade. I wish I was joking. 
We did everything from shotput 
to relays to high jump. The only 
event not on the agenda was pole 
vault. It apparently was a liability 
to catapult grossly untrained kids 
into the sky with the momentum 
of a pole. 

The capstone of the unit was 

the 
100-meter 
hurdles. 
The 

big kahuna of middle school 
physical education. A true test 
of athleticism to see who could 
master the technique of leaping 

over a barrier 
after 
just 
a 

15-minute 
demonstration. 
Have at it kids.

I 
panicked. 

My 
body 
did 

not like to leave 
the 
ground. 

The only time 
I 
caught 
air 

was diving into 
the pool. The 
prickly 
track 

did not qualify 
as a soft-landing 
surface. I braced 
myself and ran 
towards 
the 

first hurdle with 
no clue of how 
I was going to 
clear it. I lunged 
and 
somehow 

found myself on 
the other side 
unscathed. 
I 

was surprised, but this confidence 
quickly evaporated when I looked 
up and was reminded of the other 
hurdles ahead. Mind you, the 
entire gym class is watching from 
the sidelines with my gym teacher 
holding a stopwatch ready to 
record my time. What happened 
next is one of those middle school 
moments locked in my mind 
with the same clarity as Rebecca 
Black’s “Friday” lyrics. I knocked 
down the next nine hurdles. Let’s 
just say, I did not try out for the 
track and field team.

After the hurdle 
incident, 

my relationship with athletics 
was reserved for the pool and 
morning practice weight room 
sessions where I would bring 
flashcards 
to 
“study” 
before 

school. That remained the extent 
of my relationship with exercise 
upon graduating high school.

However, when you go to 

college you realize just how many 
things you do not know how to do 
in life. For me, the top of the list 
was working out. I tried running, 
but my water raised joints could 
not handle the smashing on the 
pavement. Most runs I would find 
myself regretting not turning 
around earlier and end up with 
resorting to a run-walk that made 
me look like a limping kangaroo. 
I sometimes tried to power walk 
and listen to a podcast, which 
worked out well for a while until I 
got annoyed with the headphone 
cord and didn’t want to invest in 
Bluetooth. I even briefly tried to 
establish a gym workout routine, 
but soon realized I had no clue 
how to organize a workout. I 
tried downloading apps, googling 
exercises, setting a timer, but it 
was all too complicated and I 
never pushed myself enough for 
my heart rate to go up.

It is still a mystery to me how 

all those people at the gym with 
their “in the zone” face and 
flawless 
transitions 
between 

exercises know what they are 
doing. Do they count in their 

head? How do they decide which 
exercise to do next? Have they 
just been doing the same workout 
since 10th grade? These are all 
questions I would like answers to. 
 

I soon realized that I was going 

to need a little more hand holding 
if I wanted to release endorphins. 
This is how I found myself at a 
step aerobics class. Yep, a class 
of 55-year-old women taught me 
how to work out. I understand 
how 
ridiculous 
this 
sounds 

coming from a 19-year-old girl. 
We are supposed to be young 
and agile and do yoga four days a 
week in athleisure attire. 

At first, I truly was a fish out of 

water. The thing about gyms is no 
one ever tells you the protocol. It 
was trial and error until I learned 
the latest you could arrive to 
still snag a spot in the prime real 
estate of the back row and which 
weights I could sustain for the 
entire five minutes of the remixed 
version of Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5.” 

The class was certainly not 

sexy like Soul Cycle. And I was 
definitely not part of the inner 
circle of regulars who would share 
recipes and save spots for each 
other. But there was something 
about awful America’s Top 40 
music playlists. The instructors 
on their air traffic controller style 
headsets yelling during mountain 
climbers to “pretend there is 
a wine glass in front of you.” 
And the mutual judgement that 
would incur when the occasional 
male dropped into the class and 
put three risers under his step 
without realizing the class is an 
hour of nonstop cardio. I was 
there for the bad music and sweat. 
It was incredibly motivating. No 
wonder this echelon of suburban 
moms and grandmothers were so 
fit, they figured out something no 
one ever teaches you in gym class 
— athleticism isn’t always about 
proving yourself. It is enough to 
show up wearing an old T-shirt 
and mimic an instructor jump 
around a step for an hour.

“ I 

am here today not because I 
want to be. I am terrified. I 
am here because I believe it is 

my civic duty to tell you what happened to 
me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in 
high school.” - Dr. Christine Blasey Ford

On a Thursday afternoon late in 

September, these words were spoken but 
not heard. They fell on the deaf ears of 
blind men sitting just feet away, the Kings 
of the Hill — Capitol Hill. Reverberations 
of these words were felt through television 
sets in living rooms, and through car 
radios, and through newspaper headlines 
and through conversations between 
couples behind you in coffee shops. While 
these words were not heard, they were 
felt. Half of the committee room felt them, 
half of America felt them and I felt them. 
For two full days of “hearings,” a week of 
an investigation and finally a vote, things 
carried on pretty much like this.

Time is truly, as they say, of the essence 

when it comes to these kinds of things, 
like when healing time sometimes 
exceeds that of the statute of limitations. 
And while time may seem to be working 
in your favor, it might actually be working 
against you. How much time did it take 
us to get here? Depending on who you 
ask, you’ll get different answers. Many 
point back to a letter, which Ford sent 
recounting her alleged sexual assault 
by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Others 
point back to his nomination itself as the 
impetus. Others still look over 30 years 
back, to the summer of 1982. Some look 
a little closer, to about this time in 1991 
when another woman, attorney Anita 
Hill, fought the same fight only to lose. 
Have the rules changed since then?

Personally, I’d say it took about two 

years.

“Have you heard anything about this 

whole Kavanaugh thing?” he asked. 

I hadn’t. But, two weeks into school I 

was still actively trying to fit in with my 
boyfriend’s new “law school” friends.

“She’s not like other undergrads.” I’d 

imagine them thinking after I wooed 
them with my eloquence discussing 
current events. Of course, such a facade 
could not be maintained for long.

I nodded, adding, “It’s a real shit show,” 

every bit as eloquent as one might expect. 
Thinking I’d entered this Buffalo Wild 
Wings to pretend to watch the Lions 
game, I fell, ill-prepared, into a political 
arena I’d been hoping to avoid.

So it began: “Do you think she made it 

up?” No.

“When do you think she might step 

forward?” Why should she?

“Why’d Feinstein keep it under wraps 

so long?” Who?

“Could it really be any different from 

Anita Hill?” There’s been so much 
progress since then, hasn’t there?

“Can I get out? I have to pee.”
The last one was from me. My thighs 

stuck to the seat as I slid out from the booth. 
My now red and slightly sticky thighs 
carried me to the bathroom. Pants up, I 
sat down on the toilet, arms outstretched, 
hands pressed into either side of the stall. 
My breathing slowed, and only then did 
I realize that I’d been breathing quickly. 
I had heard of Kavanaugh. I knew he’d 
been nominated to the Supreme Court. 
And, living in Washington, D.C. over 
the summer had indirectly taught me 
a lot about his opinions on everything 
from presidential indictment to the 
maintenance of precedent. But I hadn’t 
yet heard the 50 yes votes and 48 no 
votes. I hadn’t yet seen him sneer and spit 
through his testimony. I hadn’t yet read 
the Washington Post article outing Ford 
as the accuser, or the Wall Street Journal 
op-ed where he too claimed the status of 
“victim,” and I certainly hadn’t yet heard 
of a letter being passed hand-to-hand that 
would change the course of Kavanaugh’s 
nomination.

At this point in time, I had only heard 

thoughts on an attempted rape from 
the mouths of first-year law students in 
between slurps of Canadian beer and 
bites of mozzarella sticks. They liked 
beer.Sliding back into the booth, they 
were once again talking about the game. 

The Lions actually won. In retrospect it 
feels like a sick sort of foreshadowing.

For that entire week, I was besieged by 

the Kavanaugh hearings. Being a fairly 
politically-active person, and associating 
with similarly politically-active friends, 
it was the only topic of discussion. Like 
a dance we’d begin slowly, circling each 
other from across the room to start with 
small talk. The music begins, with a soft 
introduction: “How’d your meeting go 
this afternoon?”

“Did you end up getting that summer 

job?” then, like a sharp note to switch the 
tone we clasp hands:

“So, what do you think about all this 

Kavanaugh stuff, huh?” A tango. For the 
most part, I let them lead. Some push the 
tempo, “Timing was way too fishy, she’s 
gotta be lying.”

Kicking up my heels, in, out, step back 

and one, two, three…

Others slow things down. “Really, I just 

never watch the news anymore,” an open 
embrace.

But eventually, we get there, their hot 

take I didn’t ask for, or a tempered position 
that I could’ve gone without. Since tango 
is 
highly 
improvisational, 
personal 

and impulsive, it is not strange that it 
has managed to quickly evolve from its 
traditional form into dozens of styles that 
are today practiced all around the world. 

So too, is it not strange that the simple 
topic of the Kavanaugh hearings has 
evoked dozens of different conversations, 
following me, one leg wrapped around, 
gancho-style in a closed embrace. Friday 
ended and I was granted the temporary 
reprieve of an empty dance card.

During that break, I, and the country 

waited. And it is in this in-between, this 
schism of time, that I put pen to paper. 
Like Ford had told the Washington 
Post before going public, “Why suffer 
through the annihilation if it’s not going 
to matter?”

For me, the Kavanaugh hearings had 

crumbled a wall. The reverberations of 
Ford’s testimony were felt in a part of my 
brain that had gone untouched for nearly 
two years — dormant and undisturbed. 
I had built a wall in the back of my mind 
and forgotten what I’d placed behind it. 
Then in sleepy September a voice came 
knocking, cracking and crumbling the 
wall I’d maintained for so so long.

During her five minutes, Sen. Amy 

Klobuchar, 
D-Minn., 
asked 
Judge 

Kavanaugh whether or not he had ever 
blacked out from drinking.

Quite famously now, he retorted “Have 

you?”

I had.
While I heard a lot of questions over 

the two days of hearings, many listed 
above, the one that rose above the rest, 
that resounded the loudest and hung 
in my mind was; “What would have 
happened if I had reported?” and “If 
not then, will I have to later?” Fickle 
time reared its ugly head once more. I 
didn’t speak up when it happened to me. 
I didn’t know how. I wasn’t ready, and I 
didn’t want to. I needed time to process 
what had happened. To sober up and 
straighten my clothes. I needed healing 
time, both physically and mentally. Later, 
I needed therapy, 55 minutes at a time 
but sometimes we went a little over. I just 
needed time. But, as written, and pinned 
on the black dresses among the protestors 
in the Senate building, “Time’s up.”

Looking 
back, 
the 
evidence 
is 

undeniable. Not that Kavanagh was guilty 
of anything or even guilty of attempted 
anything, but instead that truth is placed 
at a lesser premium than politics and 
privilege. When it comes to reporting 
rape and attempted rape, the burden falls 
wholly on the shoulders of an already 
broken woman. We don’t give time credit 
for how ruthless and unforgiving it can be. 
Time will not wait for you to be ready. I will 
never be ready to report. I don’t know if 
anyone is ever actually ready. Sometimes, 
something just forces you to — a desire for 
justice, the hope to prevent a perpetuation 
of pain, or in Ford’s case, the recognition 
of something bigger than the self. For me, 
this piece was not written, it was born: the 
bastard child of two unwanted affairs.

éline was a fashion house run 
by women for women. Celine — 
with the accent above the “e” 
conspicuously deleted — is a 
fashion house run by Hedi Sli-
mane for Hedi Slimane.
On Sept. 2, every post on the 
official Céline Instagram was 

deleted and replaced with a new branding cam-
paign by Slimane that introduced a logo that 
purged the ubiquitous accented “é.” A series 
of three posts that debuted the new, accent-
less Celine. In the caption, an explanation was 
given.
“THE ACCENT ON THE ‘E’ HAS BEEN REMOVED 
TO ENABLE A SIMPLIFIED AND MORE BAL-
ANCED PROPORTION, EVOKING THE CELINE 
COLLECTIONS OF THE 1960’S WHERE THE 
ACCENT WASN’T USED OFTEN,” the photo 
caption read. “#CELINEBYHEDISLIMANE.”
These posts were Slimane’s debut as the new 
creative director of Celine, where he succeeded 
the beloved, previous creative director Phoe-
be Philo, who held the position for 10 years. 
This rebranding, along with Slimane’s reputa-
tion based on his work at Dior and as creative 
director of Saint Laurent — also a name change 
he is responsible for — had the fashion world 
waiting skeptically for the Celine SS19 show on 
Sept. 28.
And it was bad. The show was full of designs 
directly derivative of his work at Saint Laurent. 
He showed that the one aesthetic he can exe-
cute is short skirts and dark colors that never 
quite have the edge of punk (think McQueen) 
and lack the polish of being truly mod (think 
Burberry). Everything that could have possibly 
been wrong with the design was wrong. The 
colors were too dark. The textures were try-
ing too hard to be interesting, and the music 
wasn’t trying hard enough. Silhouettes — bor-
ing. Makeup — lacking expression. Audience 
— stacked with invited celebrities. And, only 
nine models of color walked in the entire show.
But making boring, overtly-sexualized clothes 
isn’t necessarily a crime.
“Why am I so mad?” I ask myself when I see the 
YSL 2.0 dresses and the accent-less logo.
The problem is this so-called “BALANCE” 
Slimane is after, which he mentioned in the 
rebranding Instagram posts.
Under Philo, Céline was a home for quirky, 
artistic fashion that women could feel comfort-
able in — wearable sculpture that was actually 
made for everyday wear. Céline women had to 
worry about keeping their SS12 sunglasses, 
modeled by Joan Didion (pictured), scratch 
free. They did not have to worry about itchy 
sequins scratching their skin.
The unapologetic imbalance of Philo’s Céline 
in favor of empowered women, comfort and art 
counterbalanced the rest of the fashion indus-
try that objectifies women and makes uncom-
fortable clothes without artistic integrity. Now 
that Slimane’s Celine follows suit, the industry 
is lacking balance.

“The problem is this 
so-called “BALANCE” 
Slimane is after, that 
he mentioned in the 
re-branding Instagram 
posts. 
Under 
Philo, 

Céline was completely 
off kilter.”

T

hrough my childhood, I attended Père Gabriel Richard Elementary School in 
Grosse Pointe, and was taught the accomplishments of the school’s namesake. 
There are at least four schools in and around Detroit named after Richard, a per-

son who was committed to the promotion of education in Michigan.

Richard was a humanitarian who spent much of his life promoting education on the 

frontier. He built schools for both white and Native American children — despite the area’s 
generally problematic history with Native Americans — helped the city of Detroit avoid a 
food crisis and potential ruin after the fire of 1805 and assisted cholera victims until he died 
in 1832.

But perhaps Richard’s most lasting legacy was the establishment of an overly-ambitious 

joint venture on the American frontier in 1817 which would ultimately become the Univer-
sity of Michigan. For its first 20 years, the University was only an idea, with no student ever 
enrolled at the university level. The school we know today wasn’t established in practice 
until 1837 when it moved from Detroit to the then-small settlement 
of Ann Arbor.

It was during the Detroit fire in 1805 that Richard also penned the 

official motto of Detroit: “Speramus meliora; resurget cineribus,” or 
“We hope for better things; it will rise from the ashes.” In many ways, 
this is also a metaphor for the University, which nearly faded into 
irrelevance leading up to 1837.

While I didn’t know Richard’s legacy completely as a young stu-

dent, I could nonetheless appreciate his dedication to education. From 
a young age, his lesson was ingrained in me — helping teach me the 
importance of education.

This appreciation spread out of the confines of my elementary 

school building as well. Living minutes away from Detroit, I would 
often see Richard’s many memorials in the city. Whether it be driv-
ing past Pere Gabriel Richard Park on Jefferson Avenue or visiting 
his tomb and state historical marker at Ste. Anne de Detroit Catholic 
Church, I knew Richard helped build Detroit.

Yet, years later when I arrived at the University, the figure who was 

so ever-present in my hometown’s lore drew barely a mention in Ann 
Arbor — a town he was arguably even more instrumental in building.

Walking down State Street in 2017, it was impossible to miss the 

banners commemorating the University of Michigan’s Bicentennial. 
Our school’s 200th birthday instilled a sense of commonality for stu-
dents, faculty and alumni alike, one in which we could take pride in 
our heritage. At least that’s what I was supposed to think.

When the banners were pulled down and the festivities faded, 

our school origins were once again difficult to find. Sure, we knew it 
was old and prestigious — but while many students (myself included) 
saw this history as distinctive, we failed to recognize the ones who 
founded the Catholepistemiad, or University of Michigania, in the 
first place.

I am only aware of our university’s founders’ legacies because I 

went to an elementary school named after one of them. When the 
University moved to Ann Arbor, new leaders emerged and, from their 
perspective, they started from scratch. Yet, since the 1930s, the Uni-
versity has proclaimed 1817 as its original founding date, prompting 
debate over whether or not the University may claim an extra 20 years 
of history. 

In recent years, the University strengthened its efforts to connect 

to its original home in Detroit, perhaps an attempt to fully recog-
nize to its roots. Whether or not this commitment will be successful 
remains to be determined. Regardless, I now go to a school founded 
by — yet not named after — Richard. Why is this?

Why should we care about the 
University’s forgotten Detroit roots?

A 

few days ago, I saw 
a 
man 
rollerblading 

while pushing a stroller 

with a golden retriever trailing 
behind on a leash. The spectacle 
looked like an American Ninja 
Warrior audition. As I watched 
the feat from across the street, I 
considered the skill of this man 
completing his Saturday morning 
to-do list while balancing on 
eight wheels.

In that moment, I came to two 

conclusions. First, his dedication 
to exercise seemingly convinced 
him that rollerblading while 
responsible for the livelihood 
of a baby and a dog was a good 
idea. And secondly, my own 
coordination will likely never 
surmount to the athleticism 
required to complete such an 
act. Not that I am disappointed, I 
can certainly think of a lot better 
things to do with my weekend 
than fall face first on a pothole-
ridden road.

I 
have 
never 
categorized 

myself as naturally athletic. You 

know, one of those people who 
can effortlessly recall their days 
as a three-sport athlete and win 
Spikeball the first time they play. 
The one sport I played in high 
school was swimming, which I 
had grown up participating in. 
And like anything, once you spend 
10 years practicing something, 
it is reasonable to expect your 
ability to hover around at least 
average.

The only biological evidence 

I have of my athletic ability was 
when a nurse told me that my low 
blood pressure suggested I spent 
a lot of time holding my breath. I 
guess swimming with your face 
in the water for a decade does 
something to your body beyond 
pruney fingertips. 

So I don’t have the blood of a 

track star. But I did not need a 
doctor to tell me that. The sheer 
number of times I have stubbed 
my toe while walking around 
the house or didn’t catch the 
beach ball during icebreakers is 
probably enough empirical proof.

My lack of natural athletic 

ability was confirmed in seventh-
grade gym class — arguably, an 
experience specifically designed 
to test the resilience of fragile 
13-year-old 
self-esteem. 
I 

dreaded having to don the cotton 
uniform and break a sweat to the 
Black Eyed Peas and Lady Gaga 
dance party anthems found on 
any middle schooler’s iPod Nano 
in 2012. The crown jewel of my 
gym teacher’s curriculum was 
the track and field unit. We were 
required to complete every event 
for a grade. I wish I was joking. 
We did everything from shotput 
to relays to high jump. The only 
event not on the agenda was pole 
vault. It apparently was a liability 
to catapult grossly untrained kids 
into the sky with the momentum 
of a pole. 

The capstone of the unit was 

the 
100-meter 
hurdles. 
The 

big kahuna of middle school 
physical education. A true test 
of athleticism to see who could 
master the technique of leaping 

over a barrier 
after 
just 
a 

15-minute 
demonstration. 
Have at it kids.

I 
panicked. 

My 
body 
did 

not like to leave 
the 
ground. 

The only time 
I 
caught 
air 

was diving into 
the pool. The 
prickly 
track 

did not qualify 
as a soft-landing 
surface. I braced 
myself and ran 
towards 
the 

first hurdle with 
no clue of how 
I was going to 
clear it. I lunged 
and 
somehow 

found myself on 
the other side 
unscathed. 
I 

was surprised, but this confidence 
quickly evaporated when I looked 
up and was reminded of the other 
hurdles ahead. Mind you, the 
entire gym class is watching from 
the sidelines with my gym teacher 
holding a stopwatch ready to 
record my time. What happened 
next is one of those middle school 
moments locked in my mind 
with the same clarity as Rebecca 
Black’s “Friday” lyrics. I knocked 
down the next nine hurdles. Let’s 
just say, I did not try out for the 
track and field team.

After the hurdle 
incident, 

my relationship with athletics 
was reserved for the pool and 
morning practice weight room 
sessions where I would bring 
flashcards 
to 
“study” 
before 

school. That remained the extent 
of my relationship with exercise 
upon graduating high school.

However, when you go to 

college you realize just how many 
things you do not know how to do 
in life. For me, the top of the list 
was working out. I tried running, 
but my water raised joints could 
not handle the smashing on the 
pavement. Most runs I would find 
myself regretting not turning 
around earlier and end up with 
resorting to a run-walk that made 
me look like a limping kangaroo. 
I sometimes tried to power walk 
and listen to a podcast, which 
worked out well for a while until I 
got annoyed with the headphone 
cord and didn’t want to invest in 
Bluetooth. I even briefly tried to 
establish a gym workout routine, 
but soon realized I had no clue 
how to organize a workout. I 
tried downloading apps, googling 
exercises, setting a timer, but it 
was all too complicated and I 
never pushed myself enough for 
my heart rate to go up.

It is still a mystery to me how 

all those people at the gym with 
their “in the zone” face and 
flawless 
transitions 
between 

exercises know what they are 
doing. Do they count in their 

head? How do they decide which 
exercise to do next? Have they 
just been doing the same workout 
since 10th grade? These are all 
questions I would like answers to. 
 

I soon realized that I was going 

to need a little more hand holding 
if I wanted to release endorphins. 
This is how I found myself at a 
step aerobics class. Yep, a class 
of 55-year-old women taught me 
how to work out. I understand 
how 
ridiculous 
this 
sounds 

coming from a 19-year-old girl. 
We are supposed to be young 
and agile and do yoga four days a 
week in athleisure attire. 

At first, I truly was a fish out of 

water. The thing about gyms is no 
one ever tells you the protocol. It 
was trial and error until I learned 
the latest you could arrive to 
still snag a spot in the prime real 
estate of the back row and which 
weights I could sustain for the 
entire five minutes of the remixed 
version of Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5.” 

The class was certainly not 

sexy like Soul Cycle. And I was 
definitely not part of the inner 
circle of regulars who would share 
recipes and save spots for each 
other. But there was something 
about awful America’s Top 40 
music playlists. The instructors 
on their air traffic controller style 
headsets yelling during mountain 
climbers to “pretend there is 
a wine glass in front of you.” 
And the mutual judgement that 
would incur when the occasional 
male dropped into the class and 
put three risers under his step 
without realizing the class is an 
hour of nonstop cardio. I was 
there for the bad music and sweat. 
It was incredibly motivating. No 
wonder this echelon of suburban 
moms and grandmothers were so 
fit, they figured out something no 
one ever teaches you in gym class 
— athleticism isn’t always about 
proving yourself. It is enough to 
show up wearing an old T-shirt 
and mimic an instructor jump 
around a step for an hour.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | OCTOBER 31, 2018


“ I 

am here today not because I 
want to be. I am terrified. I 
am here because I believe it is 

my civic duty to tell you what happened to 
me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in 
high school.” - Dr. Christine Blasey Ford

On a Thursday afternoon late in 

September, these words were spoken 
but not heard. They fell on the deaf ears 
of blind men sitting just feet away, the 
Kings of the Hill. Reverberations of these 
words were felt through television sets 
in living rooms, and through car radios, 
and through newspaper headlines and 
through conversations between couples 
behind you in coffee shops. While these 
words were not heard, they were felt. 
Half of the committee room felt them, 
half of America felt them and I felt them. 
For two full days of “hearings,” a week of 
an investigation and finally a vote, things 
carried on pretty much like this.

Time is truly, as they say, of the essence 

when it comes to these kinds of things, 
like when healing time sometimes 
exceeds that of the statute of limitations. 
And while time may seem to be working 
in your favor, it might actually be working 
against you. How much time did it take 
us to get here? Depending on who you 
ask, you’ll get different answers. Many 
point back to a letter, which Ford sent 
recounting her alleged sexual assault 
by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Others 
point back to his nomination itself as the 
impetus. Others still look over 30 years 
back, to the summer of 1982. Some look 
a little closer, to about this time in 1991 
when another woman, attorney Anita 
Hill, fought the same fight only to lose. 
Have the rules changed since then?

Personally, I’d say it took about two 

years.

“Have you heard anything about this 

whole Kavanaugh thing?” he asked. 

I hadn’t. But, two weeks into school I 

was still actively trying to fit in with my 
boyfriend’s new “law school” friends.

“She’s not like other undergrads.” I’d 

imagine them thinking after I wooed 
them with my eloquence discussing 
current events. Of course, such a facade 
could not be maintained for long.

I nodded, adding, “It’s a real shit show,” 

every bit as eloquent as one might expect. 
Thinking I’d entered this Buffalo Wild 
Wings to pretend to watch the Lions 
game, I fell, ill-prepared, into a political 
arena I’d been hoping to avoid.

So it began: “Do you think she made it 

up?” No.

“When do you think she might step 

forward?” Why should she?

“Why’d Feinstein keep it under wraps 

so long?” Who?

“Could it really be any different from 

Anita Hill?” There’s been so much 
progress since then, hasn’t there?

“Can I get out? I have to pee.”
The last one was from me. My thighs 

stuck to the seat as I slid out from the booth. 
My now red and slightly sticky thighs 
carried me to the bathroom. Pants up, I 
sat down on the toilet, arms outstretched, 
hands pressed into either side of the stall. 
My breathing slowed, and only then did 
I realize that I’d been breathing quickly. 
I had heard of Kavanaugh. I knew he’d 
been nominated to the Supreme Court. 
And, living in Washington, D.C. over 
the summer had indirectly taught me 
a lot about his opinions on everything 
from presidential indictment to the 
maintenance of precedent. But I hadn’t 
yet heard the 50 yes votes and 48 no 
votes. I hadn’t yet seen him sneer and spit 
through his testimony. I hadn’t yet read 
the Washington Post article outing Ford 
as the accuser, or the Wall Street Journal 
op-ed where he too claimed the status of 
“victim,” and I certainly hadn’t yet heard 
of a letter being passed hand-to-hand that 
would change the course of Kavanaugh’s 
nomination.

At this point in time, I had only heard 

thoughts on an attempted rape from 
the mouths of first-year law students in 
between slurps of Canadian beer and 
bites of mozzarella sticks. They liked 
beer.Sliding back into the booth, they 
were once again talking about the game. 

The Lions actually won. In retrospect it 
feels like a sick sort of foreshadowing.

For that entire week, I was besieged by 

the Kavanaugh hearings. Being a fairly 
politically-active person, and associating 
with similarly politically-active friends, 
it was the only topic of discussion. Like 
a dance we’d begin slowly, circling each 
other from across the room to start with 
small talk. The music begins, with a soft 
introduction: “How’d your meeting go 
this afternoon?”

“Did you end up getting that summer 

job?” then, like a sharp note to switch the 
tone we clasp hands:

“So, what do you think about all this 

Kavanaugh stuff, huh?” A tango. For the 
most part, I let them lead. Some push the 
tempo, “Timing was way too fishy, she’s 
gotta be lying.”

Kicking up my heels, in, out, step back 

and one, two, three…

Others slow things down. “Really, I just 

never watch the news anymore,” an open 
embrace.

But eventually, we get there, their hot 

take I didn’t ask for, or a tempered position 
that I could’ve gone without. Since tango 
is 
highly 
improvisational, 
personal 

and impulsive, it is not strange that it 
has managed to quickly evolve from its 
traditional form into dozens of styles that 
are today practiced all around the world. 

So too, is it not strange that the simple 
topic of the Kavanaugh hearings has 
evoked dozens of different conversations, 
following me, one leg wrapped around, 
gancho-style in a closed embrace. Friday 
ended and I was granted the temporary 
reprieve of an empty dance card.

During that break, I, and the country 

waited. And it is in this in-between, this 
schism of time, that I put pen to paper. 
Like Ford had told the Washington 
Post before going public, “Why suffer 
through the annihilation if it’s not going 
to matter?”

For me, the Kavanaugh hearings had 

crumbled a wall. The reverberations of 
Ford’s testimony were felt in a part of my 
brain that had gone untouched for nearly 
two years — dormant and undisturbed. 
I had built a wall in the back of my mind 
and forgotten what I’d placed behind it. 
Then in sleepy September a voice came 
knocking, cracking and crumbling the 
wall I’d maintained for so so long.

During her five minutes, Sen. Amy 

Klobuchar, 
D-Minn., 
asked 
Judge 

Kavanaugh whether or not he had ever 
blacked out from drinking.

Quite famously now, he retorted “Have 

you?”

I had.
While I heard a lot of questions over 

the two days of hearings, many listed 
above, the one that rose above the rest, 
that resounded the loudest and hung 
in my mind was; “What would have 
happened if I had reported?” and “If 
not then, will I have to later?” Fickle 
time reared its ugly head once more. I 
didn’t speak up when it happened to me. 
I didn’t know how. I wasn’t ready, and I 
didn’t want to. I needed time to process 
what had happened. To sober up and 
straighten my clothes. I needed healing 
time, both physically and mentally. Later, 
I needed therapy, 55 minutes at a time 
but sometimes we went a little over. I just 
needed time. But, as written, and pinned 
on the black dresses among the protestors 
in the Senate building, “Time’s up.”

Looking 
back, 
the 
evidence 
is 

undeniable. Not that Kavanagh was guilty 
of anything or even guilty of attempted 
anything, but instead that truth is placed 
at a lesser premium than politics and 
privilege. When it comes to reporting 
rape and attempted rape, the burden falls 
wholly on the shoulders of an already 
broken woman. We don’t give time credit 
for how ruthless and unforgiving it can be. 
Time will not wait for you to be ready. I will 
never be ready to report. I don’t know if 
anyone is ever actually ready. Sometimes, 
something just forces you to — a desire for 
justice, the hope to prevent a perpetuation 
of pain, or in Ford’s case, the recognition 
of something bigger than the self. For me, 
this piece was not written, it was born: the 
bastard child of two unwanted affairs.

With

traveling 

all 
the 
way 
from 

Connecticut, the loss of 
power couldn’t stop us at 
Sigma Phi from hosting 
our house show. My feet 
were wet and it was real 
cold, but sitting together 
in the candlelight made it 
that much more special.
