Vice president for 
research plans to 
continue support 

for innovation

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter 

After serving as interim in 

the role for almost two years, 
Jack Hu, the University’s current 
vice 
president 
for 
research, 

was approved for a three-year 
appointment, effective Jan. 1, 
2016 through Dec. 31, 2018, in 
December.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily on Jan. 12, Hu 
outlined several goals for his role, 
including supporting creating 
opportunities 
for 
students, 

supporting 
faculty 
research 

and innovation and fostering 
interdisciplinary initiatives.

The 
search 
process 
for 

Hu’s position was consulted 
by University President Mark 
Schlissel 
with 
the 
aim 
of 

identifying and evaluating senior 
officers who would be qualified 
for the position, according to 
University Regent Kathy White 
(D–Ann 
Arbor). 
During 
the 

process, Schlissel consulted with 
the Board of Regents and asked 
for their input, leading to their 
December vote on appointing 
Schlissel’s recommendation, Hu.

In the University Board of 

Regents’ action item from its 
meeting in December, Schlissel 
summarized 
several 
reasons 

why Hu was a viable candidate, 
citing his leadership skills and 
experience in particular.

“Professor 
Hu’s 
proven 

leadership skills, breadth and 
depth of experience, vision and 
demonstrated 
commitment 

to the University of Michigan 
make him ideally suited for the 
responsibilities of vice president 
for research,” Schlissel said.

Hu was originally appointed as 

interim vice president following 
former vice president Stephen 
Forrest’s announcement to step 
down from the position and

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R –Tex.) discusses his desire to restore the Constitution to its original form and defend it if elected president during a rally at Johnson County 
Fairgrounds outside Iowa City, Iowa, on Sunday.

Senator wins 

Republican Iowa 

caucus by roughly 3 

percent

By EMMA KINERY

Daily News Editor

IOWA CITY — A day before he 

won the nation’s first caucus by 
about three percent, Sen. Ted Cruz 

(R–Tex.) made sure Iowan voters 
knew he was the most conservative 
presidential candidate at his rally 
in Iowa City Sunday.

On Sunday, Sen. Cruz’s final 

appeals aimed to cement the 
votes of the farthest right-wing 
constituents — and the final polls 
showed his effort drew them in, 
as well as others.

During his remarks, Sen. Cruz 

urged attendees to each persuade 
nine other friends to caucus for 
him, and for those who were too 

young to vote: persuade 10.

“I’m 
not 
suggesting 
voter 

fraud,” he said. “If every one of 
you brings nine other people to 
the caucus tomorrow night, you 
will have voted 10 times.”

According to the Associated 

Press’s poll, Sen. Cruz won the 
caucuses with 27.7 percent. In 
second and third place were 
Donald 
Trump 
and 
Marco 

Rubio, at 24.4 and 23 percent 
respectively as of Monday night.

At Sunday’s rally, the focus 

rested 
largely 
on 
speakers 

who 
could 
speak 
to 
Cruz’s 

conservative credentials, with 
almost sixty minutes devoted to a 
range of individuals emphasizing 
Cruz’s devotion to conservative 
values and the strength of his 
conservative convictions. The 
candidate spoke for about fifteen 
minutes afterward to close out 
the rally.

Representative aims 
to exempt feminine 
hygiene products 
from state revenue

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Michigan is joining several 

other states in the nation 
in working to abolish the 
so-called 
“tampon 
tax” 

through a new House bill 
that seeks to exempt several 
feminine hygiene products, 
including tampons and pads, 
from taxation among other 
products.

Rep. Sarah Roberts (D–

St. Clair Shores) introduced 
House Bill 5234 on Jan. 21 after 
hearing about an activist in 
New York who was advocating 
for removal of the tax.

“I thought this absolutely 

makes sense that we should 
not be taxing women for 
being women,” Roberts said 
in an interview. “The state 
has a number of things that 
are seen as necessary items, 
like food and prescriptions, 
and I think feminine hygiene 
products are necessary items. 
It is something we cannot not 
have.”

The bill has garnered 28 

co-sponsors, three of which 
are Republicans. Nine of the 
21 total women in the state 
House have supported the bill.

“Women menstruate, we’ve 

been doing it for a very long 
time, and we should be talking 
about it,” Roberts said. “We 

should make it accessible and 
affordable and safe.”

The push to remove the 

tax started with California 
state Rep. Cristina Garcia 
(D–Calif.), who got the idea 
to make feminine hygiene 
products tax free after hearing 
from 
local 
constituents 

who said the tampon tax 
accumulates to a large portion 
of their income.

Garcia 
said 
women 
are 

being taxed for being women 
and that until recently, men 
were afraid to approach the 
subject.

“We’ve 
been 
taught 
to 

hide this,” Garcia said when 
announcing the bill. “The 
reality is, these institutions of 
power are male-dominated.”

According to Garcia, the 

average 
California 
woman 

spends $7 a year on taxes for 
purchasing tampons and other 
feminine hygiene products. 
 

The state generates $20 million 
annually from these taxes 
alone, Garcia said in a press 
release. Nationwide, tampons 
are taxed more than candy and 
soda, according to a study from 
the Tax Foundation. Roberts 
said the average American 
woman will use upwards of 
17,000 tampons and sanitary 
napkins during her lifetime, 
not including those used by 
her daughters.

LSA 
sophomore 
Ashley 

Wilson, social media director 
of Students for Choice, said 
she thought this new initiative 
can positively affect women of 
lower income status.

Over a dozen 

artists play Hill 

Auditorium as part 
of annual festival

By ARIANA ASSAF

Daily Arts Writer

Last weekend, over a dozen 

musical acts graced the stage 
at Hill Auditorium as part of 
the 39th annual Ann Arbor 
Folk Festival. Not knowing 
much about folk music, I went 
in expecting songs praising 
the good ol’ US of A backed 
by banjos and harmonicas. 
But like many other genres of 
today, folk music is not defined 
by such specific parameters.

Friday night at the festival 

exposed me to a grandiose 
landscape 
of 
styles: 
from 

soft vocalists to rock ‘n’ roll 
guitar players and everything 
in 
between. 
A 
voice 
that 

particularly 
caught 
my 

attention was that of Dallas 
Green, City and Colour’s lead 
singer. Green began his music 
career as guitarist/lead singer 
of Helicon Blue in the early 
2000s, co-founded hardcore 
band Alexisonfire after that, 
and released his first album 
as City and Colour in 2005. 
Since then, the project has 
earned 
him 
international 

attention, and he’s performed 
everywhere from his home city 
of Toronto to South America 
(along with pop-star-turned-
country-singer Pink on their 
duo, You+Me).

Yet for all that big-time 

success, 
City 
and 
Colour’s 

performance felt as intimate 
as old friends sharing secrets 
and memories in the comfort 

of a living room. Green’s casual 
flannel and baseball cap lent 
an air of relaxation to the regal 
Hill Auditorium that perfectly 
matched the calmness of his 
voice, allowing him to establish 
instant familiarity with the 
audience regardless of whether 
or not they were already fans of 
his music.

The 
band 
kept 
the 

performance balanced with a 
good mix of recent work and old 
favorites, highlighting songs 
like “If I Should Go Before You,” 
a beautiful example of Green’s 
vocal and emotional range. 
A 
well-received 
throwback 

came in the form of “Grand 
Optimist” 
from 
the 
album 

Little Hell, as eerie “ooooh” ’s 
made walls vibrate and souls 
tingle — the kind of effect only 
a live performance can achieve. 
They ended the set with the

LSA forum draws 
few students, some 
faculty to League 

ballroom 

By EMILY MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

The College of Literature, 

Science and the Arts hosted the 
first of two workshops Monday 
to receive feedback and ideas 
from students regarding ways 
to facilitate a more inclusive and 
diverse climate on campus.

The workshop is part of LSA’s 

Plan-A-Thon, an initiative to help 
generate ideas before submitting 
a college-wide plan to enhance 
diversity at the school. The 
plan, which will be submitted 
on March 15 and implemented 
next fall, is part of University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

strategic plan on diversity, equity 
and inclusion.

While this event aimed to 

engage students in the planning 
process 
according 
to 
event 

organizers, about half of the 
audience Monday was made up 
of faculty members. The room 
was setup to accommodate a 
large crowd, but only a few of the 
tables in the League ballroom 
were 
filled, 
with 
about 
15 

students and 15 faculty members 
in attendance.

During 
the 
workshop, 

administrators 
presented 
the 

current draft of the plan to gauge 
reactions to initiatives presented 
and brainstorm ways to improve.

Broderick Johnson 
recounts formation of 
Obama’s community 
outreach initiatives

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

University 
alum 
Broderick 

Johnson, White House cabinet 
secretary 
and 
chair 
of 
the 

administration’s 
My 
Brother’s 

Keeper task force, delivered a 
lecture about his experiences 
in the White House at the Ford 
School of Public Policy Monday 
afternoon. 

Johnson — who received his 

law degree from the University — 
joined President Barack Obama’s 
administration in 2013.

During his address, Johnson 

spoke of his experiences working 
closely with Obama and his 
leadership in My Brother’s Keeper, 

a program created by Obama that 
aims to address the persistent 
opportunity gaps faced by young 
men of color.

Johnson himself grew up in 

lower-class areas of Baltimore, 
he told the crowd. He said the 
foundation 
for 
the 
program 

was prompted by the death of 
Travyvon Martin, a Black teen, in 
2012.

“The president spoke about 

anger and angst after the death of 
Trayvon Martin,” Johnson said. 
“He and I talked about what we 
could do to use the power of the 
presidency to go big on this and do 
something significant.”

Six 
guidelines 
drive 
the 

program: preparing young boys 
for school, ensuring they have 
the ability to read by grade three, 
making sure boys graduate from 
high school in preparation for 
college, ensuring they complete 
postsecondary 
education, 

entering the workforce and, most 
importantly, giving the population 

targeted second chances.

“Boys and young men of 

color are more likely to live in 
concentrated 
poverty, 
attend 

poorly funded schools,” Johnson 
said. “They too often receive harsh 
punishments and are least likely 
to be given a second chance … 
we can’t have millions of young 
people missing from this society.”

Johnson also spoke about the 

extension of My Brother’s Keeper 
into the private sector. Through 
the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance, 
the program also corresponds 
with the NBA. Their program, the 
“In Real Life Campaign,” aims to 
connect every child who wants a 
mentor with a player and to share 
some of the backgrounds of NBA 
players.

Johnson said more than 200 

communities have pledged to be 
My Brother’s Keeper communities 
to combat current statistics on 
educational 
achievement 
for 

young men of color. Last year, 
Johnson said, 4,000 three- and 

four-year-olds were suspended 
from preschool. He also noted 
that young Black men, who 
comprise 6 percent of the 

population, account for more than 
half of all homicides in the nation.

“(My 
Brother’s 
Keeper) 
is 

about disrupting the status quo, 
where everyone has a fair shot and 
everyone is in the game,” Johnson 
said. “While social transformation 
is complex and measured over 
decades, I can personally see that 
we are getting closer and closer 
every day, but we still have a lot of 
work to do.”

Beyond his talk on My Brother’s 

Keeper, Johnson also discussed 
his work as cabinet secretary and 
relationship with Obama. Despite 
nearing the end of his term, 
Johnson said the administration 
has plans to continue its work.

He 
touched 
on 
several 

memorable moments he shared 
with 
the 
Obamas: 
crossing 

the bridge in Selma, and many 
briefings in the Oval Office.

“Working in the White House 

is the hardest job I have ever 
had,” Johnson said. “As cabinet 
secretary, we have surreal and 
unexpected 
challenges 
with 

a Congress that has a lot of 
challenges within itself. It’s been 
my distinct honor to get to know 
the president as a friend. He is 
quite an amazing human being. It’s 
hard but incredibly rewarding.”

TABLES AND TENTS 

Fundraisers for Flint, Honduras

CLAIRE ABDO/Daily

Art & Design freshman Nate Rieger browses albums at 
Encore Records on East Liberty Street on Monday. 

OFF THE RECORD

The Michigan Daily is 

introducing a new rotating 
item, Tents and Tables, that 
seeks to highlight campus 
activities on the Diag and near 
the posting wall in Angell Hall. 

Student organizations 

tabled at Angell Hall and the 
basement of the Union to 
raise funds for the Flint water 
crisis and Students Helping 
Honduras.

The National Council 

of Negro Women at the 
University collected water 
bottles, wipes and money 
for relief in Flint, where 
contaminated water pipes 
have corroded, allowing lead 
into the city’s water supply.

To provide an alternative 

for the contaminated water 
in the city, the NCNW will 
donate its collections to Live 

United’s Flint Water Fund. 
LSA juniors Micah Griggs 
and Asia Paige said NCNW 
wanted to contribute because 
of connections to the majority 
Black population in Flint.

“We just think that 

since Flint is a heavily Black 
population and since they are 
being affected by this crisis 
and we’re a Black collegiate 
organization, we just thought 
it was in our duty to fundraise 
and help our neighboring 
city,” Griggs said.

As for the entire 

organization, Paige said the 
NCNW also raises funds to 
sponsor future events hosted 
by the organization, such as 
the HIV/AIDS Monologue 
last December, by conducting 
bubble tea and Panera 
fundraisers. She said NCNW 
hopes to add a capstone event 

to their fundraising efforts.

“We’re trying to hold an 

event that showcases Black 
culture and Black talent,” Page 
said. “It’s called ‘Black En 
Vogue.’”

Students Helping 

Honduras, a student 
organization at the University 
that sends members to build 
schools in Honduras to end 
gang violence and poverty 
through youth empowerment 
and education also manned 
tables at Angell Hall Monday 
to raise funds.

The group sold packets of 

Puppy Chow to complement 
their other, larger fundraising 
efforts in April and February.

LSA freshman Veronica 

Orellana said the Angell Hall 
area can be a hit or a miss 
when it comes to collecting 
funds.

Broderick Johnson, White House cabinet secretary, discusses his experiences as the chair of the My Brother’s Keeper 
Task Force as a part of the Policy Talks series in the Ford School of Public Policy on Monday. 

dean 
for 
undergraduate 

education, said the goal of the 
strategic plan was to find realistic 
ways to implement the goals of 
students regarding the climate 
on campus.

“We did want to come up 

with a way to help students 
build their own capacity to think 
about how you move from a good 
idea to something that might 
become a part of a strategic 
plan at something like a major 
university,” Dillard said.

Dillard said she thought the 

talk went well, but she was 
disappointed by the low turnout.

“I 
think 
students 
aren’t 

connecting to this process and it’s 
really tough to figure out how to 
get them to connect,” Dillard said.

Amanda Alexander, assistant 

professor in the Afroamerican 
and African Studies Department, 
discussed a variety of initiatives 
in the current draft of the plan, 
such as the Ban the Box initiative, 
which would remove questions 
about an individual’s criminal 
record from applications for 
admission 
the 
University. 

Another initiative in the draft 
plan calls for disarming campus 
police officers.

Alexander 
said 
her 
goal 

in pushing to include these 
initiatives is to help embrace 
potential 
students 
at 
the 

University and foster a greater 
sense of community.

“Whether it’s mental health, 

whether it’s being undocumented, 
whether it’s having a criminal 
record, there are all of these 
points of stigma and silence and 
shame that students don’t have 
here,” she said.

Matthew 
Countryman, 

associate professor of history 
and American culture, presented 
on the ways affirmative action 
and University policies impacted 
minority enrollment.

Affirmative action has been 

banned 
at 
Michigan 
public 

colleges since the passage of 
a statewide ballot proposal in 
2006. In that year, Black students 
comprised 7.2 percent of the 
overall campus population. In 
2015, Black students make up 
4.82 percent.

Countryman discussed how 

last year there was an increase 
in underrepresented minorities 
in the incoming class, which he 
says could be due to less early 
applicants being accepted than in 
years past. Countryman said this 
change implies the University 
could make adjustments to the 
admissions process that might 
lead to more diversity.

“It’s shocking to me that a 

slight tweak in the process could 
produce this shift when we were 
told for 10 years that there was 
nothing the University could do,” 
Countryman said.

Faculty 
members 
also 

discussed 
how 
the 
language 

of plan itself may contribute to 
an insufficient conversation on 
issues of inclusion. Ruby Tapia, 
associate professor of women’s 
studies and English, said diversity 
may no longer be the optimal 
word for campaigns such as this 
due to it being overused, which 
she termed “diversity fatigue.”

“People feel like we don’t need 

to talk about these issues because 
we’ve 
already 
talked 
about 

them,” Tapia said.

Tapia 
recommended 
the 

word 
justice, 
which 
several 

participants 
said 
elicits 
a 

better sense of action. She also 
commended the inclusion of the 
word equity in the plan’s name.

White House cabinet secretary 
stresses inspiring Black youth


return to teaching in 2013. Prior 
to his appointment as interim vice 
president, Hu served as associate 
dean for academic affairs in the 
College of Engineering, and was 
also associate dean for research 
and graduate education.

Because 
then-current 

University President Mary Sue 
Coleman was retiring in the 
summer of 2014, Hu said she did 
not want to choose someone to 
serve in the position long-term.

Instead, 
Hu 
was 
given 
a 

two-year 
interim 
appointment 

from Coleman, who knew him 
through their work experience 
together 
on 
the 
Advanced 

Manufacturing 
Partnership, 
a 

selection of leaders assembled 
by President Barack Obama to 
develop 
recommendations 
on 

strengthening U.S. manufacturing.

During Hu’s tenure as interim 

vice president, two significant 
University 
initiatives 
were 

launched, including the M-City test 
environment at the University’s 
Mobility Transformation Center 
as well as a campus-wide initiative 
in data science.

Hu 
said 
moving 
forward, 

one key initiative he wants to 
facilitate at the University is 
creating more opportunities for 
undergraduate research. Because 
of the Undergraduate Research 
Opportunity Program, which is 
run by LSA, he said in the past 
the vice president’s office did not 
provide as much direct support for 
student research.

“Whether that is support or 

making the faculty more visible 
to the students, I want to enhance 
that,” Hu said. “I don’t have a 
concrete plan, but I had some ideas 
(being formulated) last year — that 
is to support student teams. I think 
we will have something hopefully 
in the fall that I can announce.”

Hu said he believes there could 

be research opportunities available 
for every student, though he noted 
the question remains as to how 
many students the University can 
support. However, he emphasized 
that he believed students from 
all disciplines should be able to 
participate in research.

“For the University, the goal 

is to continue to strengthen our 
reputation,” Hu said. “How do we 
make the University of Michigan 
a recognized research university? 
We are, but the question is whether 
we are at the top. We have to have 
certain strategies in continuing to 
promote our reputation.”

University 
Regent 
Andrew 

Richner (R–Grosse Pointe Park) 
said it is important for the vice 
president to have a strong academic 
background, be a well-respected 
academic leader and have vision 
and intellectual curiosity.

“(Hu) 
is 
widely 
respected 

among the campus community,” 
Richner said. “He is an outstanding 
academic leader … he brings 
real discipline and intellectual 
curiosity to his position.”

Along 
with 
new 
research 

opportunities, Hu said he also 
hopes to continue projects he 
began as an interim, including 
supporting 
research 
across 

all three University campuses 
and 
developing 
large-scale 

interdisciplinary 
research 

initiatives 
by 
facilitating 
the 

research that faculty members 
want to do.

Along with research initiatives 

on campus, Hu noted that much 
of his job encompasses obtaining 
funding for research.

Currently, 
the 
University 

receives 
one 
of 
the 
highest 

amounts of federal funding for 

research in the country, with an 
estimated $1.3 billion in research 
expenditures.

“I travel to D.C. and go to 

companies...to 
diversify 
the 

sources of funding for research,” 
Hu said. “The government funding 
has been on a decline for some time 
after the great recession. During 
that time, we had the American 
Reinvestment 
and 
Recovery 

Project, ARRA, so a lot of money 
was put into NIH, for example. 
But steadily we’re on a decline, 
so we have to find other sources 
of money to support our research 
effort.”

Beyond the government, the 

University also receives funding 
from a number of other sources, 
including industry, individuals and 
public and private foundations.

In an e-mail interview, White 

wrote that she saw increasing 
research activity and funding, 
identifying 
new 
research 

opportunities and promoting the 
commercialization of University 
discoveries, as key parts of the 
vice president for research’s role. 
Because the University is among 
the largest research institutions in 
the world, and competition is high 
for research funding, White said 
she looks forward to continued 
success in the competition for that 
funding under Hu.

Richner said he thought the has 

already had success, in terms of of 
federal grant funding and research 
funding, during Hu’s tenure as 
interim vice president.

“(Hu) 
recognizes 
that 
it’s 

really important to emphasize 
to policy makers and to other 
funding sources the importance 
of showing the progress that we’ve 
made in University research — 
what progress has been made in 
terms of research successes and 
what is being accomplished for 
the funding that we do receive,” 
Richner said.

Beyond funding, Hu noted 

that his position also requires 
him to extend his work through 
all three University campuses 
because his office supports the 
research process and manages 
their 
government 
compliance 

programs at all three. As well, 
his office works with the Office 
of Technology Transfer, an office 
that manages the University’s 
intellectual properties for all three 
campuses.

Overall, Hu said he wants to use 

several strategies to ensure the 
University maintains its reputation 
as an excellent research facility.

“(The 
University 
should) 

promote our faculty, nominate 
them for the most important 
prizes in the field, promote our 
research (and) try to demonstrate 
how we’re impacting society, 
impacting 
policy 
through 

research,” he said.

White wrote that she hopes that 

Hu finds new opportunities for the 
University to focus its research 
strengths on problems and issues 
of great importance to society.

“Finding innovative ways to 

utilize the depth and breadth of 
the University to solve societal 
problems is something I hope we 
continue to do,” she wrote.

Rackham student Marc Paff, 

a 
nuclear 
engineering 
Ph.D. 

candidate, said during his time 
at the University, the research 
programs have been beneficial, 
allowing him to further his own 
projects and network. Paff is 
currently working on devices 
often installed for border crossing 
that screen incoming vehicles and 
trucks, as well as airport baggage, 
for smuggled nuclear radiological 
material so nuclear weapons and 
bombs can be prevented from 
entering the United States.

“To me, the research that I do I 

think is really interesting from an 
intellectual standpoint,” Paff said. 
“I also see that it has real world 
application … it makes me feel like 
my research is relevant.”

Paff said he decided to attend 

graduate 
school 
at 
Michigan 

due to its highly ranked nuclear 
engineering program and its overall 
reputation as a well renowned 
research 
university. 
However, 

he also noted that he would like 
to see research at the University 
become more interdisciplinary 
and collaborative.

“Sometimes I feel like research 

at 
the 
University 
feels 
very 

particular,” Paff said. “You don’t 
collaborate with a lot of people 
outside of your immediate peers 
within your research program or 
department.”

Paff cited MCubed, a project 

that aims to bring together grad 
students 
and 
professors 
from 

departments across campus, as an 
example of good collaboration, and 
said he would like to see more like 
it.

Toni Antonucci, associate vice 

president 
for 
research, 
social 

sciences and humanities, said he 
agreed 
more 
interdisciplinary 

research would be good, but 
also noted that he thought Hu 
had been successful in working 
toward to creating opportunities 
for collaboration over the past few 
years.

“He’s 
committed 
to 
high-

quality research and to providing 
the support that our faculty needs 
to do the best research that they 
can do,” Antonucci said. “He is 
interested in disciplines and areas 
of expertise other than his own … 
When I compare what we do with 
many other universities, those 
I’ve visited or that I have former 
students at, it’s really impressive. 
We are committed to high quality 
work, we try to support our faculty 
in a lot of different ways.”

However, despite the positive 

things that University research 
has to offer, Antonucci said there 
are still many challenges that the 
University has to face.

Echoing Hu, she said it’s 

sometimes been difficult to receive 
funding from the government.

“We as a nation are not instilling 

in our citizens and in our young 
people an appreciation for what 
science can and has contributed,” 
Antonucci said. “What I think 
is a challenge that we’re facing 
right now is how to encourage 
interdisciplinary work within our 
current budget structure … We are 
facing challenges that need to be 
addressed in a different way (than 
they have been addressed in the 
past).”

Those challenges, she added, 

include genetic research, climate 
change and how to increase 
educational levels, particularly 
in light of the recently revealed 
educational issues in Detroit. In 
recent months, Detroit school 
teachers have protested poor 
school conditions, resulting in 
closings of over two-thirds of the 
city’s schools.

She noted that many of these 

issues have been considered by 
Hu, and that the importance of 
supporting collaboration is well 
ingrained at the University.

Ultimately, 
Richner 
said 

beyond his experience and ideas 
about research, he thought Hu’s 
knack for dealing with people in 
a friendly and positive way, were 
also what made him an ideal vice 
president for research.

“He’s just a pleasure to work 

with,” Richner said. “He really has 
just such a positive attitude and 
it’s contagious. I think that’s an 
important leadership skill. I think 
everyone that works with him 
enjoys working with him.”

period

concern and brings it into the 
realm of luxury products is 
ridiculous,” Wilson said. “It is 
really degrading, being forced 
to buy certain products because 
it’s all you can afford when it’s 
such a personal choice on what 
to use and what you want to put 
into your body.”

Currently, only five states 

do not tax feminine hygiene 

products: 
Minnesota, 

Pennsylvania, Maryland, New 
Jersey 
and 
Massachusetts. 

Canada abolished their tax on 
feminine hygiene products in 
the entire country.

Roberts said she is hoping 

that Michigan can be one of the 
leading states in this movement.

“There 
is 
no 
other 

comparable good or product 
that has to be purchased by 
men, and this is something that 
only affects women, and I just 
don’t think they should be taxed 
for being women,” Roberts said. 
“I think that helps to level the 

playing field.”

Wilson 
said 
she 
sees 

the removal of the tampon 
tax as not only a financial 
assistance but making women 
feel comfortable with their 
bodies.

“If we start to take away 

the 
stigma 
around 
periods 

and really start to have open 
discussions about why these 
things are necessary, it can 
really help gender equality 
and get women’s health out 
of 
political 
discussion 
and 

into 
professional 
medical 

discussion,” Wilson said.

trended solidly to the right 
wing of the party, with Mike 
Huckabee and Rick Santorum 
winning 
in 
the 
past 
two 

elections. Neither succeeded in 
their push for the GOP’s overall 
nomination, 
with 
Huckabee 

ending 
his 
campaign 
eight 

months before the 2008 election 
and Santorum suspending his 
campaign seven months before 
the 2012 election.

Before Cruz took the stage, 

Sen. Cruz’s wife Heidi Cruz, 
father 
Rafael 
Cruz, 
U.S. 

Rep. 
Steve 
King 
(R–Iowa), 

“Duck 
Dynasty” 
star 
Phil 

Robertson 
and 
conservative 

TV personality Glenn Beck all 
praised his dedication to the 
Constitution and Christianity.

Heidi Cruz urged attendees 

to 
consider 
his 
consistent 

conservative 
ideology 
when 

voting.

“I want you to leave today 

knowing why I fell in love with 
Ted Cruz, and I want you to 
leave today having fallen in love 
with Ted too,” Cruz said.

During 
his 
remarks, 

Robertson said he attended 
the rally because he fervently 
believes 
religious 
freedoms 

are at stake in the election. 
The famed duck hunter faced 
scrutiny in December 2013 
after GQ published an article 
where he spoke against the 
LGBTQ community based on 
his religious principles, which 
left him briefly banned from the 
show. Though many found his 
comments offensive, Robertson 
emerged as a hero for others 

who supported his beliefs.

“Do you understand why I 

vote Godly?” Robertson asked 
the crowd. “The reason I came 
is because the political situation 
in our culture is collapsing 
around us. In this situation 
you say: Who has the power to 
change it? You do. You have the 
power … I have found out about 
Ted Cruz; he loves God, and he 
loves James Madison.”

Robertson said many of the 

issues affecting the United States 
stem from the lack of spiritual 
members within the government.

“God raises these empires 

up; it is God who brings 
them down,” Robertson said. 
“What we have in America is a 
spiritual problem. You get the 
spiritual problem of America 
fixed, and the guys who make 
the political decisions, they’ll 
at least be Godly, and God will 
be on their side.”

He also used his persona to 

poke fun at Trump, soliciting 
audience members to help him 
blow duck calls for him.

“Trump didn’t show up for 

the debate with our man Cruz 
last night,” Robertson said. 
“So let’s try one more time to 
get Trump. Let’s call Donald 
Duck to come meet with Cruz.” 
Glenn Beck, who has never 
endorsed a political candidate 
before Sen. Cruz, also offered 
remarks praising him. 

“There’s a lot of really good 

people who are running, there’s 
one of which I don’t think is 
very good,” Beck said, referring 
to Trump. “I don’t mean that as 
a joke; I really think that. He 
concerns me gravely. I look at 
what he says, and if you look at 
the transcripts he says the same 

thing: ‘I will make America 
great again.’ No man can provide 
that. It is we the people.”

Beck said he believes the past 

two decades of presidencies 
have not positively represented 
the strong legacy of honored 
presidents 
such 
as 
George 

Washington, 
but 
believes 

Sen. Cruz’s dedication to the 
Constitution makes him the 
strongest candidate.

“It’s been a rough 20 years 

in this country,” Beck said. “It 
has been a time when we have 
seen some nice highs in the 
economy, but we haven’t seen 
highs in our integrity in this 
country, and in our integrity 
around the world.”

Following the trend set by 

the earlier speakers, in his 
remarks Sunday Sen. Cruz 
highlighted a list all of the 
changes he would make on his 
first day in office.

“The first thing I intend to do 

(as president) is rescind every 
single illegal and unconstitutional 
action 
taken 
by 
President 

Obama,” Sen. Cruz said.

Additionally, Sen. Cruz said 

he will launch an investigation 
into Planned Parenthood, end 
the persecution of religious 
liberty, dismantle the Iran 
nuclear deal and begin the 
process of moving the American 
embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

Sen. Cruz, Heidi Cruz told 

the crowd, stands apart from 
the rest of his opponents in 
terms of both his ideas and his 
morals and values. 

“This is the real deal,” 

she said. “Ted is a consistent 
conservative, not a campaign 
conservative. I knew that from 
the moment I met him.”

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

M

onday, Jan. 25, students crowded the 
seats in the Pendleton Room to listen 
to students share their experiences 

with Islamophobia. The 
event was organized by 
a committee of Muslim 
students as well as the LSA-
sponsored event “Sharing 
Stories, Building Allyhood: 
Student 
Voices 
Against 

Islamophobia.” This event 
seemed to finally be a step 
in the right direction — 
with great attendance in 
terms of demographics and 
size — because a safe space 
was created that allowed 
students affected by Islamophobia to share 
their stories without fear. One student was even 
able to lay claim to the story she had submitted 
anonymously to the group, thanking people 
for creating a space where she felt welcomed. 
After the first part of the event, in which 
students shared their stories, people broke up 
into groups to discuss what it means to act as 
an ally for Muslim students. This would have 
been more effective if there was more time for 
discussion and if there was more room capacity.

Regardless, this is the kind of action that the 

University should be taking in order to enhance 
Muslim student voices. I interviewed Prof. 
Evelyn Alsultany, director of Arab and Muslim 
American Studies, afterward, and she pointed 
out the effect of LSA organizing such an event, 
as opposed to a student group organizing 
one. She started by speaking to me about the 
University administration’s plan:

“I think that it’s yet to be seen in terms 

of ‘they have this plan for diversity, equity 
and inclusion, we’ll do our part by doing a 
report and then it’s really in their hands,’ 
” Alsultany said. “I think a good sign right 
now is that this event was actually organized 
by the LSA undergraduate division, which 
says something. In the past it’s usually that 
students organize something or a mosque 
organizes something and it doesn’t draw a 
crowd like this, and I think having the support 
for LSA for this event was meaningful.”

The event demonstrated positive aspects 

that I hope will be carried through in future 
programs. With the help of LSA, the event 
was advertised better than any solely student-

organized event, and done in collaboration 
with a group of students so that it did not feel 
isolated from the Muslim community. When 
the University organizes events with similar 
goals, such as the diversity summit events, they 
should try to use similar methods to welcome 
students of different backgrounds to bridge 
the gap and foster trust in the University.

I also talked to Nadia Aggour, a graduate 

student in the School of Social Work who is 
training with CAPS, about the effectiveness 
of the event. Aggour attended the event and 
offered a lending ear in case the event itself was 
triggering to students, which was comforting 
and mindful of the organizers. I asked Aggour 
what she thought about the effectiveness of 
the event and she, like Alsutany, said some of 
the departments are better at being attentive 
to the history of the institution’s awareness of 
the effect of sociopolitical events on students, 
but that other initiatives are just meant 
to appease students. She also commented 
on the effect of discrimination on student 
mental health: “I definitely think any form of 
discrimination or fear for safety affects mental 
health of students. Your body is put into a 
completely different response when it feels you 
are in danger.”

Recognizing Islamophobia on campus as an 

issue that genuinely affects students’ mental 
health is important. Mental health is often 
viewed as a separate issue that the University 
needs to tackle, but the intersectionalities 
between the minority and discrimination 
issues and mental health and assault were 
often not realized. Students at our university 
should not have to fight for their voices to be 
heard. This event also demonstrated the need 
for more diverse professors and faculty to be 
hired at the University, because their role in 
supporting students can be used for initiatives 
to improve campus climate.

The final portion of the event, where 

students worked together to talk about how 
to act as an ally, served as a reminder to all 
students and faculty that the problem does 
not stem from students that are affected 
by discrimination, but instead stems from 
people who act as aggressors and those who 
remain silent.

Inner conflict, the right way

T

his past summer, I found 
myself sitting across the 
table from the rock band 

Highly 
Suspect, 

educating 
the 

group 
on 
the 

features of Apple’s 
newly 
launched 

music 
streaming 

service. This was the cooler part 
of my job as an intern for the 
New York-based record label 300 
Entertainment. This internship also 
required me to sift through all the 
nuances of this new Apple Music 
platform. When the largest company 
in the world enters the music 
streaming space, 300 and the rest of 
the music industry watches. From 
labels to bloggers, this summer 
raised an important question from 
everyone: What is the future of 
music streaming?

Music streaming is at a critical 

point — though it only makes 
up about a quarter of all music 
consumption 
today, 
it 
seems 

inevitable 
that 
streaming 
will 

become the dominant medium for 
listening. Music companies are 
engaged in a battle for market share, 
known as “streaming wars.” The 
winners of these so-called streaming 
wars will collect data generated 
from hundreds of millions of active 
streamers. Really, the streaming 
wars are part of a much larger battle 
for data.

The 
music 
industry 
has 

collectively been trying to answer 
the question of how to use data 
effectively. With declining album 
sales and slowed overall growth, 
record labels and their artists 
desperately need to find ways to cut 
inefficiency. Labels have partnered 
with tech firms, and music analytics 
companies such as Next Big Sound 
have emerged — all with the hopes 

of understanding data’s relationship 
with the music business. And while 
the future role of data in music is still 
mostly unclear, streaming services 
are in a position unlike anyone else 
to tackle this problem.

Which brings us to Spotify.
Already a leader in the crowded 

music streaming space, Spotify just 
announced acquisitions of startups 
Soundwave and Cord Project, each 
indicative of where streaming is 
headed. 
Soundwave 
will 
likely 

improve social features for finding, 
sharing and talking about music. 
When I hear a song that inspires me, 
discussing it with others is a natural 
first instinct. Better messaging 
systems 
on 
these 
streaming 

platforms seems obvious for that 
reason, but isn’t happening outside 
of Spotify.

Apple Music’s attempt at a social 

network — which they call Connect 
— is actually not very social at all. 
Only artists have profiles, not users. 
This seems backwards. Artists have 
enough social networks to regularly 
update with Twitter, Facebook, 
Instagram 
and 
Snapchat. 
Does 

another one make sense?

The second Spotify acquisition, 

Cord Project, could be even more 
important for its potential in the 
evolution 
of 
data 
capabilities. 

Not 
only 
would 
discovery 

and 
curation 
improve 
with 
a 

greater understanding of music 
consumption patterns, but Spotify 
could repurpose that information 
for record labels as well. The labels 
are interested in using that data 
for things such as optimized tour 
schedules, 
targeted 
marketing 

campaigns and more efficient album 
releases.

As Spotify grows, it will collect 

more data and its product will 
get better. In a sense, quantity is 

quality. The focus on Spotify has 
been to reinvest now and worry 
about profits later. As long as they 
continue to grow, profitability won’t 
be an issue. This is another reason 
why Spotify is an outlier in the 
streaming landscape. Pandora is a 
public company, Deezer attempted 
to launch an IPO and SoundCloud 
is working on a new subscription-
based model. Spotify’s competitors 
are trying to cash in now, but the 
real money will come later.

The list of competitors is deeper 

than you may think. YouTube, 
Rhapsody, Tidal and even Amazon 
Prime offer streaming products. 
Yet out of all of them, nobody 
else is integrating social features 
like Spotify is. And nobody else is 
working to analyze the data that such 
social features will help to generate 
either. Spotify has an opportunity to 
break away from the competition as 
it continues to acquire key startups 
and grow its active user base.

I 
could 
be 
wrong, 
though. 

Between 
Apple, 
YouTube 
and 

Amazon, there are plenty of other 
big-name players now. Ultimately, 
all the investment into streaming 
is a good sign for a struggling 
industry. Music is going through a 
transitional phase because album 
sales have been cannibalized by 
streaming. As streaming services 
fight 
among 
themselves, 
they 

will be forced to solve problems 
that will benefit the industry as a 
whole. Whether you use Spotify 
or not, we should all be rooting for 
them. Creating better products and 
smarter ways to utilize data will 
connect more fans to artists and 
allow the music business to grow. A 
win for Spotify is a win for music.

Barack Obama seems intent 
on placing gun violence at 
the forefront of our national 
conversation. The National 
Rifle 
Association 
seems 

equally intent on arguing 
the opposite of whatever he 
says. Neither side, though, 
has comprehensive, repro-
ducible data supporting 
their 
arguments. 
While 

both rely on anecdotes and 
natural 
experiments 
— 

both of which can be quite 
convincing — the CDC remains mute on how 
to achieve one of the primary roles of govern-
ment: protecting its citizens. 

In 1996, former U.S. Rep. Jay Dickey (R–

Ark.) successfully lobbied on behalf of the NRA 
for putting language in the budget preventing 
the CDC from advocating for, or promoting, 
gun control. This, by former Rep. Dickey’s own 
admission, unintentionally stymied all CDC 
research on gun violence prevention and has 
led to two decades of silence from our primary 
public health research center.

As of fiscal year 2015, the CDC received $0 

from Congress for gun violence prevention 
research. President Obama, in response to 
the Sandy Hook shooting in December 2012, 
called for an end to the moratorium on feder-
ally funded scientific research exploring the 
causes of gun violence. The 2015 bill, which 
allocates $10 million per year until 2021 for 
CDC research on gun violence prevention, 
remains buried in subcommittee.

This is not to say that no private funding 

for gun violence prevention research exists. 
Several universities — including Harvard and 
Johns Hopkins — have centers or parts of cen-
ters devoted to firearm research funded by pri-
vate sources. Private funding and the resulting 
research, however, can — rightly or wrongly 
— be accused of bias more convincingly than 
public funding.

Private funding’s presence, then, cannot 

make up for the perception that the govern-
ment isn’t trying to fund the CDC, which 
makes gun violence research a pariah to the 
scientific community. It also inhibits this 
research and effectively blocks a consensus on 
how to best prevent the avoidable accidents, 

injuries and deaths attributed to gun violence. 
Contrast this with the CDC’s estimated annual 
$47.2 billion in medical expenses and produc-
tivity loss due to gun violence and the need for 
federally funded research becomes irresistibly 
reasonable.

It is so reasonable, in fact, that Mark Rosen-

berg, former director of the CDC’s National 
Center for Injury Prevention and Control — 
who claimed to be fired for his commitment 
to gun violence prevention research — and 
Dickey have come together to advocate for 
increased federal funding for gun violence 
prevention research. Through a joint appear-
ance on NPR and an op-ed in the Washing-
ton Post, Dickey and Rosenberg accept that 
though they have vehemently disagreed with 
each other in the past, they now both accept 
that substantial changes are imperative to 
improving our knowledge base and protecting 
our citizens.

Not only is public health funding necessary 

to fill a hole in our public health infrastruc-
ture, it is also an opportunity to inspire and 
train the next generation of eager students 
of public health. The University of Michigan, 
for example, is poised to open degrees in Pub-
lic Health to undergraduates — following a 
national trend. What better way to engage a 
new generation of students than to address 
one of the leading causes of avoidable injuries 
and deaths?

Gun violence is often associated with mass 

shootings, tragic events that occur with a 
depressingly normal frequency. But it is also at 
play during criminal acts, homicides, suicides 
and accidents. These avoidable tragedies mani-
fest themselves differently throughout various 
regions and within the impressively diverse 
communities that define our national iden-
tity. Without federal funding, then, we can-
not effectively develop, promote and prescribe 
tailored interventions that best decrease the 
needless deaths of tens of thousands of Ameri-
cans each year.

Our federal government, to best protect its 

citizens and provide them with the opportuni-
ty to thrive absent the horror of gun violence, 
must lift its embargo on CDC funding for gun 
violence prevention research. Not doing so 
would not only be a shirking of responsibility, 
but a passive acceptance of a disgraceful norm.

I

owa — I didn’t travel six hours 
to Iowa via Ford Fusion Hybrid 
looking for laughs (though I did 

have high hopes 
Sam and Allison, 
the other Daily 
staffers I was 
with, would be 
able 
to 
crack 

a couple jokes 
over the course 
of the trip).

We 
were 

there to cover 
the 
impending 

presidential 
caucus, after all 
— a serious matter, no doubt. Feb. 
1, Iowa voters will have the first 
turn in voting for who will be the 
presidential nominee for each party. 
And with the races neck and neck 
on both sides, there isn’t too much 
for any candidate to laugh about. 
It’s a serious race to rally as many 
voters as possible to get out and 
vote, since whoever wins in Iowa 
has the momentum for the coming 
primaries and caucuses.

However, when reflecting on the 

events I attended this past weekend, it 
became evident to me how important 
comedy is when campaigning. All 
three candidates I saw — former 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 
Sen. Bernie Sanders and Donald 
Trump — all invoked humor in some 
form, be it through quips or prepared 
lines, during their events.

As someone who enjoys comedy in 

most mediums and because I think 
I’m funny myself (character flaw, 
sorry), I place an added importance 
on the candidates’ abilities to be 
humorous. To me, humor is a sign of 
intelligence, especially in the form 
of off-the-cuff lines. If candidates 
use it right, it is an excellent way 
to connect with voters, especially 
with people they have little in 
common with. Because as much as 
I want to hear about policy from 
the candidates (How will you keep 
us safe from ISIS?!?), I also want to 
know they’re human and, even in 
serious times, I don’t want them to 
always take themselves so seriously.

Clinton started her event strong 

on humor. Because there was a 
technical error that didn’t allow a 

short montage to play, immediately 
after she walked in, she told the 
crowd of 200, “We had a video we 
were going to show you, but we had 
a technical difficulty, so you’ll just 
have to settle for me.”

Though she loses points for 

laughing at her own joke, to me that 
quip represents an endearing sense 
of self-loathing. I’d like to believe 
she hadn’t had that line pre-planned.

The jokes didn’t end there, 

though. Luckily for Clinton, this 
past weekend played right into her 
hands. Given that the town hall I 
attended was in Clinton, Iowa, I 
think everyone saw this joke coming 
from a mile away:

“I’m pretty excited about being 

here in Clinton County. You didn’t 
have to name it, I would have come 
anyway.”

Unbelievably corny? Yes, but it 

was absolutely necessary that she 
told it.

Though the rest of her speech 

didn’t contain really any more jokes 
worth noting, Clinton shined in the 
Q&A portion of the event.

When someone in the audience 

brought up how Fox News has been 
hammering her about her age, she 
responded with a smile, “They say 
nearly anything about me, I gotta 
tell you.”

She then continued with a funny 

story about how her mom watched 
Fox News, and when Clinton would 
ask why she kept watching, her 
mom replied, “Well I gotta know 
what they’re saying so I’m ready.” 
Laughter, including Clinton’s, filled 
the room.

And while discussing the role her 

husband, Bill Clinton, would play in 
her administration, she said, “The 
other day I said, ‘Well I’ll test him 
out, see how he does. You can start 
talking at the kitchen table, and if it’s 
good, we’ll go from there.’ ”

There were plenty of other solid 

lines, even better than that one, but 
ultimately what I gained was that 
through those lines, I was given 
a sliver a hope that, underneath 
the years of being a politician and 
being paid by Wall Street to give 
speeches, there remains a real, 
down-to-earth person.

Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, 

displayed more sarcastic humor, and 
he used it to give validation to his 
campaign and his supporters.

“In the last couple of weeks of 

campaigns, a lot of things are said, 
a lot of comments are made and 
you’ll be shocked to know that not 
all of them are true. I know that I 
shock you when I say that,” Sanders 
said dryly. “And one of the myths 
that is being perpetrated by the 
Clinton campaign is ‘Well you 
know, Bernie Sanders is a nice guy, 
he combs his hair beautifully … GQ 
kind of guy. But despite all of those 
fantastic attributes, he just can’t 
win. He can’t defeat the Republican 
candidates in November.’ ”

This isn’t just classic old Jewish 

man humor (trust me, I know 
from experience), but it was an 
effective 
way 
to 
immediately 

engage the audience before he dove 
into discussing his platform. And 
though he didn’t use much humor 
throughout the rest of his stump, his 
emphatic hand gestures drew plenty 
of smiles.

As for Trump, well, I kind of had 

to imagine the whole thing as one 
big comedy act for my own sanity. 
Though he did have a couple good 
lines about Ted Cruz, one being: 
“Look, you know who’s going to 
approve the (Keystone Pipeline) deal 
fast? Ted Cruz. He’s from Canada!”

Other than that, I’m not sure 

I’ve ever been so scared for the 
future of this country (still debating 
whether the tipping point was 
when a Trump supporter told Sam 
and me, “(Trump) knows so much, 
he just hasn’t told us yet” or when 
Trump had everyone look at the 
media standing in back and called us 
“sleazebags”), but I digress.

Of course, when voting for who 

you want to be the next president of 
the United States, it matters to vote 
based on what values you have and 
policies you agree with (duh). But 
we can’t forget we’re voting for a 
person, a complex entity of emotion 
and past experiences.

So the way I see it, seeing who 

can get the most laughs makes a 
difference.

Missteps and missed 

flu shots

I 

didn’t get a flu shot this year 
for the first time in my life. 
(Really taking adulthood by 

storm, evidently.) So, of course, 
this was the first year ever I 
caught the 
flu. Over the 
course of a 
week spent 
in bed, I fin-
ished binge-
watching 
the entirety 
of “Game of 
Thrones,” 
HBO’s hall-
mark fantasy 
political/
sexual drama.

I now bring up “Thrones” 

in every conversation I can. I 
read episode recaps and dive 
dangerously deep into online 
fan theories. I’m obsessed, 
obsessed with a show that is 
notorious for its wishy-washy 
treatment of women. Laden in 
turn with complex and pow-
erful female characters and 
laughably gratuitous female 
nudity, “Thrones” isn’t win-
ning feminist awards anytime 
soon. I still love it, but like 
many things in this world, I 
feel obligated to continuously 
address its latent sexism.

At the end of my week of 

influenza, my friends and I 
went to see “Sisters,” Tina Fey 
and Amy Poehler’s newest film 
about adult sisters returning 
home for one last rager in their 
parents’ house. I felt a similar 
discomfort to when I watched 
“Thrones,” but for a different 
reason. The film is resolutely 
feminist, passing the Bechdel 
test with aplomb and inserting 
sly jokes about male privilege. 
But it also features a plot line 
about a Korean character who 
fits just about every Asian 
stereotype there is. Hae-Won 
(Greta Lee, “St. Vincent”) 
and her friends work at a nail 
salon. She is casually promis-
cuous, a plaything for white 
men and she speaks heavily 
accented English, a fact from 
which an extended joke is 
drawn. It was one of the most 
demeaning portrayals of East 
Asian women I’d seen in a long 
time. Just as I was constantly 
making both excuses for and 
criticisms of “Thrones,” I felt 
I needed to do the same for 
“Sisters,” a movie starring two 
feminists and written by one. A 
work can’t be feminist if it cre-
ates isolating and tokenizing 
images of people of color — by 
definition, that’s just not what 
feminism is.

Take another Fey creation: 

the Netflix comedy “Unbreak-
able Kimmy Schmidt.” The 

show, which was released to 
universal acclaim last March, 
follows Kimmy (Ellie Kemper, 
“The Office”), a survivor of 
abuse and terror, as she moves 
to New York and starts a new 
life. Kimmy is a uniquely femi-
nist character: naïve but buoy-
ant, hard-working and honest. 
And despite the laugh-out-loud 
humor of the show, Fey does 
not represent Kimmy’s situa-
tion lightly, earnestly express-
ing her PTSD and struggles 
acclimating to society.

But there is a catch. In the 

sixth episode, we are intro-
duced to Dong (Ki Hong Lee, 
“The Maze Runner”), a Viet-
namese delivery boy who is 
ultimately Kimmy’s love inter-
est. While an intensely lovable 
character, Dong is painted 
with many of the same limiting 
stereotypes as Hae-Won; for 
me, it’s the one sour note of the 
series.

“Tina!” I groaned to myself. 

The woman who wrote hon-
estly and poignantly about 
her youthful insecurities in 
her memoir “Bossypants,” 
the woman who gave us Liz 
Lemon, who said in “30 Rock” 
that being a woman is the 
worst “because of society!” It 
hurt me to see a woman who I 
consider a personal and profes-
sional icon missing the mark by 
so much.

These representations har-

ken back to first- and second-
wave feminism, when the 
voices of women of color were 
ignored or even squashed in 
favor of the white constituen-
cy’s goals. That shit shouldn’t 
cut it anymore. All too often 
modern feminists are forget-
ting that feminism as a system 
is inclusionary. Amy Schumer 
did it in her stand up with cal-
lous jokes about Latinos. While 
she has since apologized, 
her original biases speak to a 
greater issue — feminism is not 
feminism when it continuously 
limits divergent identities 
and experiences. And frankly, 
works of art that ignore inclu-
sivity just aren’t as good.

I don’t follow sports; recent-

ly I was looking through my 
old Facebook statuses, and one 

from the 10th grade proudly 
attested that I was boycotting 
the Super Bowl. So while I 
can’t tell you which teams are 
playing in the Super Bowl this 
year, I can tell you that Cold-
play is performing the halftime 
show, featuring the Queen her-
self, Beyoncé. Last week, the 
two released the video for their 
recent collaboration, “Hymn 
for the Weekend.”

The song fucking rocks, 

groovy yet soaring in all the 
right places. On the other 
hand, the video, which features 
Chris Martin and Yoncé don-
ning traditional Hindi garb 
and dancing in front of groups 
of Indian children celebrat-
ing Holi, the Hindu festival of 
color, is a travesty and a mis-
step. It’s cultural appropriation 
in the most basic of terms, sim-
plifying complex cultures and 
people into pretty background 
props, expressing abject pover-
ty with no context or recourse. 
It’s bad. And it comes from 
Beyoncé, a publicly proud femi-
nist who has spoken out about 
recognizing women of color in 
the feminist community.

How does this still happen? 

How can women who speak 
with such depth and resonance 
about navigating a patriarchal 
world be so tone-deaf about 
other cultures? Their femi-
nism, and their art, is so much 
better without these stereo-
types and appropriations. I 
want these women I love to be 
better, because with every lim-
iting comment or joke, they not 
only hurt the community they 
are addressing — they hurt 
feminism as a whole. Feminism 
loses credibility in the minds 
of those prone to knocking 
it down and weakening the 
system by isolating female 
voices that should be included. 
I won’t stop loving Tina and 
Amy and Bey, but criticizing 
their feminism is another step 
to making feminism better. 
Just like “Game of Thrones” 
would be so much better with 
a few less naked women and a 
few more naked men. 

Gadbois encourages you all to 

vaccinate your children with femi-

nist theory. To innoculate yourself,

Lawrence wants to 
make pop cool again

By MIMI ZAK

Daily Arts Writer

Pop music gets a pretty bad 

rep, but the genre still serves its 
original intention: it’s an amal-
gamation of various kinds of 
sounds that acts as the mono-
culture from which our national 
(and international) music com-
munity ebbs and flows. Pop 
music was once used to mark the 
best original music of the time. 
The Beatles, Michael Jackson, 
Madonna, Cyndi Lauper and The 
Beach Boys were once defined 
by the now doubtful musical dis-
tinction. Where did the change 
occur? What dragged pop music 
from something that was both 
organic and relatable to some-
thing highly manufactured and 
irrelevant to anything outside the 
allegorical club?

The descent of pop music could 

be traced back, as so many things 
can, to the rise of technologies 
and the Internet. Music stream-
ing sites created an inundation of 
artists, with most searching for 
fame at any cost. Artistic value 
and organic material fell behind 
the stronger industry algorithms 
for cookie-cutter pop music. 
Lyrical depth and sonic origi-
nality became harder to find. At 
the end of the 20th century and 
at the turn of the 21st, things of 
the musical sort were excessively 
dubious. The music of those 15 
years matched the economic and 
political stagnation of the times. 
Nothing dared to be too original. 
No one wanted to cross genres. 
The times were too hard for that.

But, in looking at the Top 40 of 

the past six years, the fight for dif-
ference appears to have returned. 
That strangeness that once pos-
sessed our former kings and 
queens of pop, like Michael Jack-
son and Madonna, have started 
to re-enter the airwaves. Most 
recently, Drake’s “Hotline Bling” 
was a Billboard hit with emo-
tional depth and sonic variety. 
Omi’s “Cheerleader” had a horn 
section playing from the speakers 
of the backyard frat party down 
the street. “i” by Kendrick Lamar 
reintroduced the Isley Brothers 
to the Top 40 listeners who were 
formerly unaware of their pop 
music importance. Genres and 
specific stylings have started to 
blur. And among these new mix-
tures of soul with jazz or pop 
or rap, the constant has started 
to edge further away from the 
unfeeling party hits of yester-
days. However slowly, and how-
ever gradually, a new era of bands 
like Lawrence, an edgy pop duo, 
are fighting for the resurgence of 
good pop music.

“We love the idea of pop 

music,” said Clyde Lawrence, one 
of the two Lawrence siblings at 
the forefront of the band. “The 
accessibility of it, the ‘hookiness’ 
of it, the catchiness of it all, the 
ability to hear something once 
and totally be into it; those are 
all a lot of things that I love. I just 
don’t happen to currently like a 
lot of the pop music. I would love 
to call our music ‘pop music.’ In 
fact, I think that our music sounds 
like what I wish pop music would 
sound like.”

Gracie Lawrence, the female 

powerhouse of the band, just 
graduated from high school. She’s 
putting off her recent acceptance 
to Brown University to go on tour 
with the rest of the band. Clyde 
Lawrence just graduated from 
Brown University with most of the 
other band members. Having used 
college as a place to collect musi-
cians and create music with them, 
Clyde never molded his time for 
the sole purpose of academics.

“For me, college was ... well, I 

looked at it as a musical oppor-
tunity in a lot of ways,” Clyde 
said. “I don’t mean to belittle the 
educational opportunities that 
I received at school. Brown’s a 
really great academic school, but 
I went to school with the pure 
intention of trying to put together 
a band.”

So Clyde and Gracie Lawrence 

and their band of college musi-
cians played gigs in and around 
the Brown University communi-
ty. At dance halls, public parties 
and small gigs up and down the 
East Coast, the band used their 
soul-based pop sound and long 
list of cover songs to attract a 

groovy college crowd.

“I had always heard that col-

lege is a great place to kind of get 
a start and get a bunch of a shows 
under your belt,” Clyde said. “If 
you talked to anyone who knew 
me at Brown, they would tell you 
that that was definitely my big-
gest priority over homework. So 
for me, it wasn’t either college or 
music; it was ‘how do we make 
this music experience count?’ ”

The band’s upcoming album 

release has been a long time 
coming for many of the band’s 
followers. After Clyde’s solo EP 
release in 2013, Homesick, the 
band has been taking its time in 
creating an album they believe 
will best match the sound they 
hope to emulate. Under the 
direction of Soulive member 
Eric Krasno, the famed producer 
has helped Lawrence with con-
necting their upcoming album 
release to artists with a similar 
mission and sound.

Krasno’s network and his con-

nection to the Brooklyn blues, 
soul and funk world, aided the 
Lawrence clan in collecting musi-
cal bedfellows of similar sound 
and transcending taste.

“We were joking that we 

should really hit up Cory Henry, 
the organist from Snarky Puppy 
and get him on our album,” Gra-
cie said. “And we made that joke 
in front of Kras and he respond-
ed with, ‘Should I call in Henry, 
do you guys want Cory Henry?’ 
Same with the drummer from 
Lettuce, Adam Deitch, Krasno set 
us up with him to collaborate on 
our album.”

What about Lawrence, though, 

is so unique? What places them 
above or among the soul/pop 
sounds of today? All these ques-
tions are answerable: Lawrence 
automatically finds originality 
in the placement and following 
of their music. The band is cat-
egorized by fans as a modern act 
whose sound and message are 
linked. Lawrence is like Leon 
Bridges, Vulfpeck, Lake Street 
Dive, Donnie Trumpet & the 
Social Experiment, White Denim 
and many others because of the 
visceral, emotional, almost tan-
gible reaction that naturally 
flows from the soulful character 
of their sound. Forget the con-
veyor belts of music production 
where people create the music 
they think will sell. Lawrence 
has placed themselves among a 
selection of modern artists whose 
music is eternal because they mix 
catchiness with genuine feeling. 
They are bound together, across 
a variety of genres, as those who 
want their audience to connect as 
much as they want them to dance 
and awkwardly sway.

“The whole concept behind the 

album is that we want it all to feel 
as though it can coexist with the 
old and the new,” Clyde said. “You 

should be able to put on one of our 
songs at a party right after play-
ing a Stevie Wonder song and it 
should be able to continue what-
ever vibe or feeling the audience 
was just feeling. Then that song 
could be followed by a Beyoncé or 
Bruno Mars track.”

With Paul Simon’s Graceland 

and Carole King’s Tapestry or 
anything by Stevie Wonder in 
mind, the band Lawrence placed 
an intense amount of focus on 
creating a cohesive album with 
an overarching emotional arch.

“We are less jammy and less 

improvisionational than other 
bands in the soul and funk world 
because we are so focused on 
creating the song,” Gracie said. 
“We’re too focused on the emo-
tion and structure of the song, 
and then the album as a whole, to 
allow for too much jam band-like 
action.”

The art of the cohesive, all-

feeling album isn’t lost with 
bands like Lawrence. Time and 
specific detail was placed on the 
ebb and flow of each song in the 
context of the larger album. Emu-
lating the vision of artists they 
adore and appreciate, Lawrence 
has created an album that tells 
a story, or includes some sort of 
journey, instead of just a collec-
tion of separate pop singles.

“The 
vibes 
of 
each 
and 

every song are distinct,” Gracie 
recounted. “And I don’t know if 
people still listen to full albums, 
but hopefully they will because 
that’s how we wrote our album. 
We placed intense detail on the 
emotional journey of the album. 
We want it to be exciting for the 
album to tell its own story, and for 
every song to share its own kind 
of sound.”

Lawrence, with the help of 

Eric Krasno, are working against 
the torrential wave of cookie-cut-
ter pop music that tends to over-
take the music industry. Because 
it’s a band like Lawrence with 
whom the masses can connect. 
It is bands like Lawrence who 
could and should be well-known, 
but they’re not. And many can’t 
understand why. I don’t neces-
sarily understand why they aren’t 
more popular. There is a magnetic 
and powerful kind of sound that 
emanates from anything mix-
ing the genres of soul and pop. 
Lawrence is one of those bands 
that deliver something magnetic, 
who feel like a well-kept secret. 
They’re holding something that 
more should know about, but 
they have to look a little harder to 
find. They’re just waiting for the 
rest of the world to catch up.

Lawrence’s new album will be 

arriving sometime in the coming 
month. This coming Monday, Feb-
ruary 8, Lawrence is performing at 
the Crofoot in Pontiac, Michigan. 
Tickets are $10, and doors open at 
7 P.M.

MUSIC INTERVIEW

rousing, 
pleading 
“Lover 

Come Back” that gave the 
audience just what they were in 
the mood for: something to sing 
along to, something to make 
them smile in spite of sadness 
and something that allowed 
them to find commonalities 
between Green’s story and their 
own.

The variety of styles presented 

at the festival were embodied 
best by two acts in particular 
that have lasted throughout 
the growth and development of 
the folk genre, growing with it 
and constantly contributing to 
it. Music veterans Yo La Tengo 
and Richard Thompson, with 
musical releases dating back 
to 1996 and 1974 respectively, 
were brilliantly distinct and 
representative of tried and true 
music. Singer Georgia Hubley 

of Yo La Tengo has an almost 
meditative quality to her voice 
that makes it simultaneously 
relaxing and attention-grabbing. 
With four other instrumentalists 
complementing 
her 
sound, 

the full effect of the band’s 
simplistic style was a joy to 
experience visually and audibly.

Thompson was like the cool 

fun uncle of the night, telling 
jokes 
between 
songs 
and 

getting everyone to participate 
by teaching them some lyrics. 
Rolling Stone has called him one 
of the best guitarists of all time, 

and if you’re inclined to compare 
his fame with that of the younger 
generation, it’s interesting to 
note that his most recent album, 
Still, reached number six on UK 
charts.

Earlier in the evening, the 

rocking Ben Daniels Band — 
who just released a new EP on 
iTunes — opened the show, 
followed by the angelic voices 
of Andy Baxter and Kyle Jahnke 
of Penny and Sparrow. Nora 
Jane Struthers & The Party 
Line 
contributed 
bluegrass 

vibes, and The Oh Hellos 
brought nine people on stage 
to create the biggest sounds of 
the evening. Originally a sibling 
duo, Maggie and Tyler Heath 
have certainly grown beyond 
bedroom recordings, releasing 
two full albums and an EP 
since 2011. Their appearance at 
the festival is just one stop on 
their current North American 
tour that will include sets at 
the Okeechobee Music & Arts 
Festival and Bonnaroo.

Protomartyr live 
at the Blind Pig

Post-punk 

Detroiters play a 

show of raw emotion

By SELENA AGUILERA

Daily Arts Writer

When I walked into the Blind 

Pig, I found myself surrounded 
by guys with waxed mustaches, 
drowning in PBR. I came to 
the realization that I was in the 
center of “dad culture.” You know 
what I’m talking about. It’s like 
that awkward stage hipsters fall 
into when they feel too young to 
take life seriously, but they dress 
and act like dads. They’ve got the 
flannels and corduroy pants, their 
mustaches are straight from the 
’70s like their favorite folk band, 
and they have a small beer belly. 
Probably every person you’ve 
met who has succumbed to dad 
culture was at this Protomartyr 
show. It was an experience.

The night started off with 

the Deadbeat Beat. They’re a 
soft punk band from — as their 
Facebook page says — “AROUND 
TOWN, MI.” Their sound was 
as vague as that location, but 
the guitarist and front man 
Alex Glendening was shredding 
so hard that one of his strings 
broke 
mid-set. 
Accompanied 

by an insanely talented female 
drummer, they were captivating. 
I wanted to sway back and forth 
and close my eyes to immerse 
myself in this weird punk rock 
that made me think of summer 
and the beach, but the crowd was 
close to lifeless during their whole 
set. It was kind of a bummer.

My soul was revived again 

when the second band, Rebel 
Kind, took the stage. The band 
was composed of three women 
(hooray for all-girl bands!), and 
they totally kicked ass. They sang 
about boys and being broken and 
piecing themselves back together 
again, which sounds kind of sappy 
and lame, but they displayed it 
in such a punk-rock way. Each 
member contributed some vocals, 
but front woman Autumn Wetli 
had a particularly dreamy voice. 
It was soft yet aggressive and 
sounded like it should smell like 
vanilla. They made me feel like I 
should put on a velvet skirt and 
punch someone in the face and 
there’s just something about that 
strange combination that makes 
me feel — as corny as this sounds 
— alive or something.

They announced that it was 

their drummer’s 29th birthday 
and I remembered that the lead 
singer of Protomartyr, Joe Casey, 
is 38 years old. Just try to picture 
his lifestyle for a second – being 
almost 40 surrounded by people a 
decade younger than you who try 
to dress like you, traveling on the 
road probably eating McChickens 
every day.

And just that simple thought 

made me appreciate their set 
so much more because of this 
dynamic. There’s this crowd 
of 
people 
stuck 
between 

adolescence 
and 
adulthood 

trying to have a good time on 
a Friday who probably have a 
passion they can’t afford or are 
too afraid to follow. These bands 
aren’t giving up; they’re trying to 
fulfill their dreams and passions 
by evoking some emotions in at 
least one person. That’s what 
Protomayrtr did.

The band of four took the 

stage and with minimal crowd 
interaction, they put on a very 
enticing show. Joe Casey sounded 
like an angry drunk dad in the best 
way possible; he was enveloped in 
the music. His words came out 
harsh and cut the audience with 
every syllable. I could even see 
the beer spit fly out of his mouth 
— which was kind of gross — but 
with his eyes closed and head 
turned to the ceiling, he gave the 
set raw emotion.

Witnessing this 38-year-old 

man and even some of the older 
people in the crowd get totally 
entranced by music was inspiring. 
There were 30-year-old guys 
throwing down in a mosh pit 
screaming the lyrics of “Boyce 
or Boice” at the top of their lungs 
while making friends out of 
strangers.

The experience was a reminder 

that no matter how old you are, 
live music allows you to regress to 
a simpler time. There’s something 
kind of beautiful about being 
surrounded by sweaty bodies 
in intense heat, accepting gross 
conditions to hear something 
you love. And listening to a man 
who could be your drunk dad just 
makes it a little better. 

CONCERT REVIEW

The best and worst 
dressed: 2016 SAGs

By DAILY STYLE WRITERS

While the Screen Actors Guild 

Awards may not be the most pop-
ular or have a controversial host, 
the trends we saw on the red car-
pet, as well as on the main stage, 
are worthy of some notable men-
tions. Leo DiCaprio won a SAG 
for his work in “The Revenant” 
and basically sealed the deal for 
an Oscar win this year. If you 
didn’t catch the awards, apart 
from Leo’s momentous win, he 
brought a pretty interesting date: 
his vape pen. Don’t believe us? 
Google it. Most celebrities who 
were in attendance brought their 
A-game to the red carpet, while 
others failed in more ways than 
one — here are the best and worst 
dressed.

Rooney Mara: Best Dressed
Mara 
attended 
the 
SAG 

Awards with her sister, Kate, in a 
black Valentino gown. The gown 
features a deep-v neckline and 
open back. Mara donned a black 
cape over the gown, which she 
removed for pictures. The “Carol” 
actress wore her hair in a high, 
slicked back ponytail and boasted 
neutral-toned makeup that accen-

tuated the plunging neckline and 
open back of the dress. She fol-
lowed suit by wearing minimal 
jewelry except for a couple of 
rings. — Carly Colonnese

Nicole Kidman: Worst 

Dressed

To be honest, I totally forgot 

about Nicole Kidman. So first of 
all, due to my lapse of judgment in 
regard to her existence, I thought 
nothing could shock me more than 
seeing her at the SAG Awards, 
but then the hideous, multi-col-
ored ruffled catastrophe she had 
on managed to do the job. Gucci 
dropped the ball on this one. Rem-
iniscent of the cartoonish colored 
scheme of the Powerpuff Girls, 
nothing can make me like this 
dress, or Nicole Kidman for that 
matter. Call me biased if you must, 
but this thing is beyond saving. 
Nicole, not even Scientology can 
help you now. — Mariam Sheikh

Alicia Vikander: Best 

Dressed

It’s official. I just so happen to 

have the biggest girl crush on Ali-
cia Vikander. And why not? She is 
a powerhouse these days in Holly-
wood in both the film and fashion 
departments. Her gowns for each 
award show this season have all 
been equally on point. Donning 
a sequined, floor-length, color-
blocked gown by Louis Vuitton, 
Vikander managed to bring both 
class and trend to the carpet even 
though she showed up solo with-
out her boo Michael Fassbender 
(whom I also love). Power couple 
made in heaven, if I ever saw one. 
— Mariam Sheikh

Julianne Moore: Worst 

Dressed

Julianne Moore has been doing 

these carpets for years. She has 
a routine; she shows up wearing 
the best makeup looks, high-end 
jewelry and she is always wear-
ing some Givenchy. So one would 
expect nothing to go wrong with 
this foolproof equation, right? But 
her get-up did go horribly wrong: 
she stepped out in a Givenchy cre-
ation that had potential, with the 
exception of its vomit-green color. 
Looking like Oscar the Grouch 
from Sesame Street, all Moore 
was missing was her silver gar-
bage can to dump that piece of 
trash in. Too harsh? Just look at 
the outfit. — Mariam Sheikh

Kiernan 
Shipka: 
Best 

Dressed

Truly, Kiernan Shipka can 

do no wrong. Not only does she 
have the poise and confidence of 
someone that knows they have 
Jon Hamm’s unfailing love and 
support, she has the red carpet 
prowess to be on par with Ali-
cia Vikander and Emilia Clarke. 
The 16-year-old shined in a floral 
gown by the always-cool Erdem. 
The strapless eggplant gown with 
gorgeous blue florals and delicate 
bustier, matched with Shipka’s 
perfect blown-out blonde tresses, 
give us hope that the next Emma 
Watson is on her way. — Mara 
MacLean

Christina Hendricks: Worst 

Dressed

Compared to her “Mad Men” 

co-star, Kiernan Shipka, Christina 
Hendricks sadly was the ultimate 
red carpet fail. Wearing a Chris-
tian Siriano design, Hendricks 
appeared swathed in metallic fab-
ric. The gown featured a chunky 
bow and oversized train that 
didn’t add to the actress’s gor-

geous frame. The bow, the shiny 
fabric, the one-shouldered sleeve 
and the massive train all made for 
a completely overwhelming look. 
Hendricks tried for dramatic and 
came out drab. —Mara MacLean

Saoirse Ronan: Best Dressed
Saoirse Ronan’s red carpet 

look paralleled her acting: simple, 
powerful and mesmerizing. In a 
soft pink Michael Kors dress with 
Giuseppe Zanotti heels, Ronan 
showed just how stunning a pared 
back look can be on the red carpet. 
The Irish actress pulled her look 
back to show off her gorgeous 
Forevermark Diamond earrings 
that twinkled to compliment 
her softly sparkling pink sequin 
gown. — Mara MacLean

Brie Larson: Best Dressed
Me, you and your grandma 

have a lot in common as of late, 
and by that I mean Brie Larson 
is our “it” girl. She somehow 
managed to upstage her Golden 
Globes look with a powder blue 
Versace number, replete with 
Swarovski ties. Any client of 
Donnatella’s is a friend of fashion 
indeed. — Caroline Filips

Kate Mara: Worst Dressed
Kate Mara stepped out in a 

beige Valentino gown. Along with 
her sister Rooney, Kate’s gown 
featured a deep v-neck and side 
cutouts. However, Rooney’s black 
gown completely outshined sis-
ter Kate. Weirdly, at some angles, 
Mara’s gown looked incredibly 
elegant; the black bands perfectly 
accentuating the soft dress and the 
actress’s elegant frame. From the 
front, sadly, the dress looked more 
like taupe slivers of grandma’s cur-
tains barely covering Kate’s chest 
— bummer. — Mara Maclean

Kristen Wiig: Best Dressed
I have a soft spot in my heart 

reserved for any starlet that devi-
ates from the requisite awards 
season regalia and opts for a jump-
suit on the red carpet, and Wiig 
secured her spot with a Rouland 
Mouret one-piece. A double take 
revealed the asymmetric back 
detail and fully stole my heart. Ily, 
Kristen, ily. — Caroline Filips

Kate Winslet: Best Dressed
If you’re ever looking for 

“class” on the red carpet, Kate 
Winslet is always there to serve 
it. This year she wore a polished, 
green Giorgio Armani dress. With 
a plunging V and the soft struc-
ture of a mermaid gown, Winslet 
and her curves are looking better 
than ever. — Hannah Sparks

Leonardo DiCaprio & his 

vape pen: Worst Dressed

Seriously disappointed in Leo 

right now. So, he started off fine 
on the red carpet in a Giorgio 
Armani tuxedo. Later on dur-
ing the actual ceremony, a clip of 
DiCaprio using a vape pen flash-
es across the screen. Why, Leo? 
Smoking that vape makes you 
look like a huge douche. Please, 
never again. — Hannah Sparks

Claire Danes: Worst Dressed
I don’t know why, but the Stel-

la McCartney dress that Danes 
chose to wear to the awards 
reminds me of a stewardess’s 
uniform. At first glance I was 
feeling the two-tone vibe. After 
a close examination of the situ-
ation, I decided she looks like a 
stewardess. Danes is such a pretty 
woman, and the dress does noth-
ing for her. Time to leave before 
you miss your flight, Claire. — 
Hannah Sparks

The hardest-working individuals in America

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

Pink shoes. Pink headbands. 

Pink warmup shirts with the 
words 
“Hope, 
Fight, 
Cure” 

printed on the front. Sunday, it 
was clear that the players of the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

team weren’t competing for the 
hardest-working team in America.

Instead, the Wolverines were 

competing 
for 
the 
hardest-

working individuals in America.

Michigan didn’t skip a beat 

in pulling off a 92-76 win over 
Minnesota during its annual Pink 
Game, which serves to promote 
breast cancer awareness as well 
as celebrate the life of former 
North Carolina State coach Kay 
Yow, who passed away from stage 
4 breast cancer in 2009.

The pink game also celebrates 

survivorship 
for 
those 
in 

attendance at Crisler Center 
and 
across 
the 
nation. 
Six 

breast-cancer 
survivors 
were 

invited to dinner with the team 
Friday, introduced the starting 
lineup Sunday and received a 

pink basketball from the player 
they introduced — a tradition 
that began with the arrival of 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico in 2012.

One of those survivors is 

Barnes 
Arico’s 
stepmother 

Donna, a 10-year cancer survivor 
who has made the trip from New 
York to the Pink Game every year.

“This is one of the greatest 

days of the year for our program,” 
Barnes Arico said. “It’s really a 
special (thing) for us to honor 
those women — those strong, 
powerful, 
determined 
women 

that are persevering through 
struggles that are much tougher 
than a basketball game.”

For Barnes Arico, she didn’t 

just want her team to throw 
on some pink-colored apparel 
without it carrying some weight. 
Instead, she wanted the outfits 
to speak on a personal level with 
her players and have a special 
meaning behind it.

So Friday night, the team had 

dinner with a group of survivors 
at the Ron and Eileen Weiser 
Family 
Club 
inside 
Crisler 

Center. The survivors — hand-
selected by Abby Samuels, the 
senior community manager for 
special events at the American 
Cancer 
Society’s 
Southeast 

Michigan office — told stories of 
their battles with breast cancer 
and answered questions from 
the team about how to be more 
proactive with their own health.

“It’s really special to have a 

dinner with the ladies that get 
to teach us so much about life 
that we don’t get to see all the 
time,” said senior guard Madison 
Ristovski. “Everybody here is 
always curious about it.

“At the end of the day, it’s in 

the back of people’s minds that, 
‘What if that happens to me?’ ”

Samuels’ 
network 
at 
the 

American Cancer Society and 
strong 
volunteer 
outreach 

enabled her to find individuals to 
invite to the dinner. The leading 
factor in the decision was an the 
individuals’ involvement with the 
organization in recent months 
— for example, attending the 
Making Strides Against Breast 
Cancer Walk held in October at 

Washtenaw Community College.

The Wolverines, of course, were 

waiting at the end of the walk, 
high-fiving survivors, giving them 
roses and cheering them on as 
they crossed the finish line.

“They’re amazing volunteers,” 

Samuels said. “Them coming 
out to Making 
Strides allows 
them 
to 
see 

the 
impact 

they’re making 
with 
things 

like the Pink 
Game. … One 
of 
the 
great 

things 
about 

Michigan and 
Michigan 
athletics is that 
they teach integrity, and those 
women really have integrity.”

At age 25, just months before 

her wedding, Christy Rodriguez 
was diagnosed with breast cancer. 
The longtime Michigan fan was 
invited to Barnes Arico’s dinner 
Friday night after completing the 
Making Strides walk.

Now in her late 20s, Rodriguez 

has been cancer-free for three 
years.

“I’m 
really 
happy 
that 
I 

got invited to be a part of it,” 
Rodriguez said. “I think it’s super 
awesome that they do something 
like this every year … Being up 
there at the beginning and getting 
the basketball from the player, 
that was really awesome. Probably 
one of the coolest things I’ve 
done. I’ve gotten a lot of different 
opportunities I didn’t expect from 
having breast cancer, and things 
like this are some of the positive 
things that come out of it.”

Rodriguez joined a group of 

survivors on the court during 
halftime 
and 
were 
given 
a 

“survivor sash” by Michigan 
softball coach Carol Hutchins, 
who donned a pink No. 15 jersey 
of her own.

According to Samuels, Barnes 

Arico and Hutchins’ vision to 

emphasize the “game of life” 
within their programs ensures 
their players walk away with 
valuable life lessons aside from 
just what they learn from playing 
on the court or the diamond. 

Now in her fourth year at the 

helm, Barnes Arico sees education 

as 
a 
major 

cornerstone of 
the 
program 

she’s 
leading. 

She wants to 
educate 
her 

players on what 
breast 
cancer 

because, as she 
mentioned, 
“You’re 
never 

too young to 
get it.”

More importantly, she wants 

her team to see the value in having 
a positive attitude, being focused 
and staying determined. Friday, 
it was these three lessons that 
the six survivors spoke of when 
describing their path toward a 
cancer-free life — in addition to 
faith and family.

Barnes Arico wants her team, 

by understanding the adversity 
these women have had to face, 
to understand that life isn’t 
always about basketball, and 
reality doesn’t exist within a 
perfect bubble. 

“We’re 
playing 
college 

basketball at the highest level 
and we’re at the University 
of 
Michigan 
on 
a 
college 

scholarship, that there are people 
out there that are going through 
struggles and different hard times 
in their lives,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Sometimes it’s a great reminder 
when we get to be surrounded 
by people that are overcoming 
such great obstacles and such big 
challenges.

“At the end of the day, a 

basketball game is a basketball 
game, and this is about the 
survival in their lives.”

As for Michigan’s role in the 

fight against breast cancer, it can 

continue to provide an outlet of 
empowerment for survivors in 
the meantime. The Pink Game 
gives 
survivors 
like 
Donna 

Barnes and Christy Rodriguez 
the opportunity to come together 
and share their stories of survival 
while promoting awareness for 
those still fighting the battle.

“I think that basketball is a 

vehicle to teach (our players) 
about perseverance and about 
hard work and being part of our 
team,” Barnes Arico said. “That’s 
part of our mantra, that we are the 
hardest-working team in America.

“But really, if you’re diagnosed 

with breast cancer, you have to be 
the hardest-working individual to 
overcome that.”

Friday’s 
stories 
of 

perseverance 
must 
have 
hit 

the right emotional note with 
the 
Wolverines 
on 
Sunday 

afternoon as they pulled ahead 
of Minnesota down the stretch — 
all in front of a sea of pink.

Little 
things 
made 
the 

difference for Michigan in its 
victory — defense, free throws, 
intangibles.

But then there were the little 

things, such as a pink basketball, 
that made the difference for 
survivors in their own victory.

When Ann Arbor native Mimi 

Schork returned to her seat before 
the game, she waved her newest 
momento around in the air while 
wearing a wide smile. She looked 
as if she had just won an award, 
and those sitting around her 
began to cheer.

In 
most 
ways, 
the 
pink 

basketball was an award. It was 
a reminder of what she had been 
through and how she overcame 
it. She deserved the cheering, as 
did the rest of the survivors who 
received a standing ovation at 
halftime.

They 
hoped, 
fought 
and 

continued to work toward a cure. 
For that, they were recognized as 
the hardest-working individuals 
in America.

Quick Hits with Tyler Motte

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Writer

After the Michigan hockey 

team’s weekend sweep over 
Penn 
State, 
junior 
forward 

Tyler Motte has found himself 
in a spot he never dreamed of 
being: the leading goal scorer in 
the nation.

Through 23 games, Motte has 

netted 22 goals to go along with 
13 assists. His previous career 
high for goals in a season was 
nine, and his productivity has 
blossomed in the 12 games since 
Michigan coach Red Berenson 
put him with junior forward JT 
Compher and freshman forward 
Kyle Connor on one line.

For all those reasons, Motte 

became the focal point for this 
week’s edition of Quick Hits.

The Michigan Daily: You’re 

the leading goal scorer in the 
NCAA. How does that feel?

Tyler Motte: It feels good. 

I’ve never been one to go back 
and look at stats and compare 
myself to even my teammates, 
but having that confidence in 
your back pocket never hurts.

TMD: Did you expect this of 

yourself? You always joke that 
you’re not a skill player and those 
are the ones who usually are at 
the top of the leaderboards.

TM: I don’t think I would’ve 

ever been the top goal scorer 
in the country. Like you said, 
I’ve never really been that type 
of player. I’ve always tried to 
be a 200-foot type guy, and 
that is really my game. But the 
chemistry with my linemates 
has worked out.

TMD: Your line has been 

pretty good. Is there a thing 
between you and JT where 
you guys are making sure Kyle, 
the freshman, doesn’t lead the 
nation in goals?

TM: No. (Laughs.) Not at 

all. We’ve been joking around 
with the guys about this. But 
it’s great to see a guy dominate 
as a freshman similar to (how) 
Dylan Larkin did it last year. 
Each of them dominated in 
different ways, but it’s great to 
see freshmen come to Michigan 
and be able to do that. Just to see 
JT and how he works and puts 

up numbers, he’s proud of that.

TMD: Well, JT had a nice 

toe drag this weekend. Were 
you like, “Wow, JT, how did you 
do that?”

TM: Yeah, he might joke 

around and tell you he is a skill 
guy, too, but it was a phenomenal 
play, something he has in his 
back pocket.

TMD: It’s been coined the 

“CCM 
line.” 

Are you guys 
trying 
to 

earn a future 
sponsorship 
from 
them? 

What’s 
with 

that?

TM: I didn’t 

quite 
know 

what it meant 
at 
first. 
I 

thought it was 
because we all used their sticks, 
but then JT doesn’t, he uses 
Bauer, and then I realized it had 
to do with our names. It’s pretty 
creative, though. It’s pretty 
good. I’ve definitely heard worse 
names for lines.

TMD: The team has been 

giving you crap for the beanie you 
wear. I see it’s changed colors.

TM: Yeah. I got a new one. I 

found one in my closet. Some 
might call it bad press with that 
haircut article there, but it’s 

good, it’s fun.

TMD: You won’t take it off 

until you start slowing down 
with your points, right?

TM: It’s no superstition.
TMD: Nolan is the team 

barber. Should one of our writers 
get a haircut from him?

TM: I don’t know how open 

the barber shop is to walk-ins. 
But he does a good job. If he 

doesn’t 
make 

it in hockey, 
he 
could 

definitely open 
his own barber 
shop.

TMD: 

Describe Max 
Shuart.

TM: I don’t 

know if there 
is 
one 
way 

to 
describe 

Max Shuart other than he’s a 
character. He sits next to me in 
the locker room and sometimes 
is a peanut gallery. He really has 
a good balance of having fun and 
enjoying things while also doing 
it the right way.

TMD: Could he beat Michael 

Downing in a fight?

TM: I’d like to see a best-of-

three or best-of-five series there. 
I could see it going either way.

TMD: You, JT and Kyle are all 

up for the Hobey Baker Award, 

but it can only be one.

TM: Yeah. Unfortunately, that 

is how it goes. I think it could be 
unbelievable to see a freshman 
win back-to-back years.

TMD: When Kevin Porter 

won the Hobey in 2008, his 
linemate Chad Kolarik, who was 
up for the Hobey, wanted to vault 
Porter to win and pushed for it 
despite being a strong candidate 
as well. Have you guys discussed 
this?

TM: I don’t think any of us 

focus on it that much, but to have 
another Hobey Baker winner at 
Michigan would be huge.

TMD: You took a nasty hit 

at the Garden. There are some 
pictures that show you chewing 
your mouthguard rather than 
wearing it. Why do you do that?

TM: Well, I’ve had the same 

mouthguard 
here 
since 
my 

freshman year so it doesn’t 
exactly snuggly fit any more. 
Most guys don’t even wear them 
even more.

TMD: Will you wear one now?
TM: We’ll see if the old one 

still fits. I might.

TMD: You’re growing quite 

the beard here. What’s with 
that?

TM: There is no superstition 

behind the beard. I do tend to trim 
it up a bit. In the winter, I don’t 
like to go clean-shaven. It’s comfy.

Michigan preps 
for top-25 battle

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team ended the first half of the 
Big Ten season with a four-game 
sweep against 
the 
bottom 

half 
of 
the 

conference, 
downing 
unheralded 
Minnesota, 
Nebraska, 
Rutgers 
and 

Penn 
State 

teams.

Now, sitting 

at exactly the 
midway 
point 

in 
conference 

play, 
the 

Wolverines (7-2 Big Ten, 17-5 
overall) face a two-game stretch 
of top-25 talent, hosting No. 22 
Indiana on Tuesday and No. 10 
Michigan State on Saturday.

The Hoosiers (8-1, 18-4), led by 

senior guard Yogi Ferrell, come to 
town atop the Big Ten standings 
following a six-point win over 
Minnesota on Saturday. Ferrell, 
who opted to return for his final 
year at Indiana instead of entering 
the NBA Draft, has been one of 
the conference’s top performers, 
pacing 17.5 points and nearly six 
assists per contest.

The Indiana native has a 

history of torching Michigan. 
In 
five 
games 
against 
the 

Wolverines in his career, Ferrell 
has shot better than 60 percent 
and averaged more than 16 points 
per game — and he’s done it in a 
number of ways. Last year, he 
used a variety of made jumpers to 
tally 14 points against Michigan; 
the season before, he knocked 
down seven 3-pointers to put up 
27 to help take down a then-10th-
ranked Wolverines team.

“His quickness is such that, 

yeah, there’s a lot of things you 
do (to try to stop him),” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“What’s really good is you have 
a really good player playing 

against him that can stay in 
front of him, and that’s our hope, 
that a combination of (junior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. and 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman) can do 
that and that we don’t have 
to give as much help. But he’s 
going get his points; he’s going 
to get to the foul line; he’s going 
to get his assists. Try to not let 
the other guys beat you, that’s 
another thought.”

The 
biggest 
problem 
for 

Michigan is that those other 
guys who surround Ferrell are 
just as dangerous. Indiana has 
two other starters averaging 12 
points or better in sophomore 
forward Troy Williams (13.1) 
and freshman center Thomas 
Bryant (12.4). It will take a team 
effort for Michigan to contend 
against the country’s second-
best shooting team.

“(We need to) try to stay out 

of foul trouble and not make it a 
1-on-1 matchup,” Walton said. 
“Remember that it’s all about 
winning. There’s going to be some 
times tomorrow (Ferrell) makes a 
really good play or I make a really 
good play or either of us go on a 
tear, making three or four plays 
in a row. It’s all about just staying 
with the team goals of the night 
and game plan. … When the game 
is over, the better point guard is 
the one that wins.”

What could be the biggest 

lift for Michigan, though, is the 
potential return of senior guard 
Caris LeVert. Beilein has been 
cryptic about LeVert’s return 
date since he injured his left 
foot against Illinois on Dec. 30, 
causing him to miss the last eight 
games. But Monday, Beilein said 
that his return could be soon.

“Caris did more (Sunday) than 

he’s done at all,” Beilein said. 
“This was the first time he really 
tested himself more than he has. 
So it’s day-to-day, and we’ll wait 
and see when he’s ready to go. 
It’s ultimately going to be his 
decision. It could be soon. It could 
be later.”

Fighting the hidden battles

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

Garrick 
Roemer 
was 

scared. The 17-year-old wasn’t 
comfortable in the back of the 
ambulance. He didn’t want to be 
there, and on the surface, it didn’t 
look like he belonged there either.

His mom, Cathy Radovich, 

overheard him nervously asking 
the paramedics if his emergency 
trip to the hospital was going to 
follow him, if people were going to 
hear about it.

Outside 
that 
ambulance, 

Roemer seemed to be living out a 
reality he had strived for. As a 2012 
graduate of Saline High School and 
lifelong Michigan fan, he grew up 
a hop, skip and a jump away from 
Ann Arbor as he ran to an All-
State title in the 400-meter dash. 
He committed to Michigan’s track 
and field team as a preferred walk-
on, rejecting a partial scholarship 
from Michigan State in order to 
don the maize and blue. There 
are pictures of Roemer dressed in 
Michigan apparel from the age of 
2 onward, and a scholarship offer 
from his rival wasn’t going to sway 
him. He came to Ann Arbor to 
fulfill his dream.

But you can’t always tell what’s 

really going on from the outside 
looking in.

On 
that 
day, 
the 
future 

Michigan track athlete didn’t want 
to go to the hospital, didn’t want 
to talk about his problems — but 
Radovich knew he needed to. The 
spring of his senior year of high 
school was difficult for Roemer, 
so after consulting his therapist, 
Radovich called the paramedics, 
and Roemer reluctantly got in the 
ambulance.

He looked physically healthy, 

and 
he 
wasn’t 
sick 
in 
the 

traditional sense. But he had 
threatened to hurt himself in front 
of people at school, and that was 
enough cause for alarm.

When people suffer from a 

heart attack or a stroke, they don’t 
worry about seeking medical 
attention. 
But 
when 
people 

need an emergency psychiatric 
evaluation, they very rarely seek 
the help they need. Sitting in an 
ambulance with his life in danger, 
Roemer was wondering what 
other people would think.

For most athletes, the biggest 

battle takes place internally. And 
far too often, that struggle goes 
unheard.

A 2014 study conducted by 

Dr. Daniel Eisenberg and Ph.D. 
candidate Sarah Ketchen Lipson 
at the University showed that of a 
random sample of approximately 
7,000 students at nine colleges, 
just 30 percent of those with 
depression or anxiety sought 
mental health services.

For 
student-athletes, 
the 

statistic was even lower. Just 10 
percent of student-athletes with 
depression or anxiety used mental 
health services.

In May 2014, following his 

second year at Michigan, Roemer 
committed suicide. According to 
Radovich, a “perfect storm” of 
events had hit her son, including 
injury and an isolating redshirt 
sophomore year that prevented 
him from traveling with his 
teammates.

“I think stigma really was a part 

of what stopped him from getting 
the help he needed, and that’s 
kinda why I’m here (talking about 
it),” Radovich said. “Whether 
you’re an athlete or not, it hovers 
over you.”

* * *

Almost two years later, on Jan. 

22 of this year, Radovich sat at a 
table describing the thoughts she 
believed her son may have had 
that spring day. The only way the 
stigma would go away was if she 
talked about it.

Sitting next to her was Will 

Heininger, a former Michigan 
football player who left his job 
in Chicago when he realized 
that he wanted to join Athletes 
Connected, 
a 
University 

organization 
dedicated 
to 

supporting 
student-athlete 

mental health and one of the first 
programs of its kind.

On that Friday afternoon, the 

Athletes 
Connected 
Advisory 

Board — a sort of “think tank” 
for current and former student-
athletes, interested community 
members, 
clinicians 
and 

psychiatrists to suggest ways to 
improve mental health on campus 
— met for the second time.

The 
Athletes 
Connected 

initiative 
first 
formed 
when 

Eisenberg, an associate professor 
in the School of Public Health, 
saw a posting for the NCAA 
Innovations in Research and 
Practice Grant. He learned about 
the grant about the same time 
as Trish Meyer, the manager for 
outreach and education at the 
University’s Depression Center, 
and the two reached out to Barb 
Hansen, one of three athletic 
counselors 
employed 
by 
the 

Michigan Athletic Department.

In April 2014, the Athletes 

Connected initiative received a 
$50,000 grant to conduct research 
on student-athlete mental health. 
Athletes Connected was born as a 
partnership between the School of 
Public Health, Depression Center 
and Athletic Department, with 
the major goals being to reduce 
the stigma of mental health 
issues, promote coping skills and 
encourage 
help-seeking. 
The 

group moved quickly, conducting 
student-athlete 
and 
athletic 

trainer focus groups over the 
summer.

Throughout 
the 
2014-15 

school year, Athletes Connected 
presented 
to 
every 
athletic 

team and its coaching staff, and 
provided 
biweekly 
75-minute 

support groups with a clinical 
social worker for student-athletes 
who wanted to listen or share their 
experiences dealing with stress.

Athletes Connected first told 

the coaches about the initiative in 
September 2014, and then checked 
back in to update them with 
results in May 2015.

Next, they opened up the floor 

for questions.

Which coach put his hand in 

the air first? Michigan football 
coach Jim Harbaugh.

“He started asking questions 

and then other coaches got 
involved,” Meyer said. “It was 
really, really encouraging and 
heartening because they care so 
much for their student-athletes 
and they want to know that there’s 
a system in place that going to 
support them in that way.”

* * *

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

coach John Beilein has seen a lot 
over his 40 years of coaching. 
Like Harbaugh, he was an active 
participant during the Athletes 
Connected presentation, and for 
good reason.

“Over 
my 
(career), 
I’ve 

probably had four or five kids with 
depression,” Beilein said. “During 
that time, I was virtually helpless 
as a coach. I would talk to them and 

there wasn’t anything happening. 
They needed clinical help. That’s 
why this is so important.”

He’s a strong believer in the 

power 
that 
mindfulness 
can 

bring to the court and even cites 
a time that Jordan Morgan, a 
former Michigan captain, added 
meditation 
to 
his 
game-day 

routine to alleviate any nerves 
about free-throw shooting.

Morgan, a subpar foul shooter 

who made 56.5 percent of his 
free throws in his career, made 
seven of eight shots in a 2014 
NCAA Tournament game against 
Texas. Beilein credits the standout 
performance to the fact that 
Morgan happened to mediate 
three times that day, focusing on 
seeing himself make foul shots.

It’s not uncommon for seasoned 

coaches to get stuck in their ways. 
Beilein has run the same offense 
his entire career, but he readily 
admits that his viewpoints on 
mental health have changed over 
time, especially as he started to 
grasp what was really at stake 
with his athletes.

“There are so many things going 

on with these kids; mental health 
and their mental development is 
huge for them,” Beilein said. “I’ve 
seen 
it 
over 

these years. I 
wish I knew 
more about it 
when I was a 
younger coach. 
I 
would 
just 

blame it maybe 
on, ‘Oh he’s not 
tough enough,’ 
or, ‘He doesn’t 
have 
the 
ice 

water in his veins to play.’

“That’s all he needed, was 

someone to talk to.”

* * *

Back in his playing days, 

Heininger decided to talk to 
someone, and it changed his life.

According to a video featuring 

Heininger 
on 
the 
Athletes 

Connected website — the same 
video Athletes Connected shows 
every Michigan athlete — he 
started “hating himself and his 
life” and had “all the classic 
symptoms 
of 
depression, 
but 

didn’t know what it was” during 
his sophomore year of college.

As an Ann Arbor native who 

attended Pioneer High School, 
which 
sits 
kitty-corner 
to 

Michigan Stadium, he dreamed of 
playing football at Michigan. He 
had no idea why he was feeling the 
way he was.

Finally, an athletic trainer 

noticed he was in pain and set 
him up with Barb Hansen, the 
Michigan 
athletic 
counselor 

now 
involved 
with 
Athletes 

Connected. 
They 
worked 
on 

coping techniques, highlighted 
by the video, and he opened up 
and stopped hiding his feelings. 
Ultimately, he recovered from 
depression and became a “better 
student, player and person.”

Now, Heininger is 27 and 

teaches new athletes the same 
coping techniques Hansen taught 
him. Athletes Connected is hoping 
its presentations help student-
athletes realize why they feel 
the way they do so they don’t get 
caught in the dark like he once did.

“In a cool way, just knowing 

— like I didn’t even know what 
depression was, right? I had no 
idea what had happened to me,” 
Heininger said. “But I’ve had a 
number of freshmen now, who 
are like, ‘Yeah, I get it. If there’s 
something off with my mood, then 

I can do something about it, just 
like if there’s something off with my 
knee, I can do something with it.’ ”

Heininger often makes that 

analogy, that, as an athlete, if 
there’s something wrong with 
your body, you take care of it 
immediately. He wants every 
athlete to know that issues with 

mental 
health 

can be handled 
in 
the 
same 

fashion.

That’s why, 

after two years 
of working a 
finance 
job 

in 
Chicago, 

Heininger 
decided 
to 

come home to 

Ann Arbor. When he received the 
call asking if he would like to come 
back and work with his former 
counselor as well as Eisenberg and 
Meyer, he experienced a moment 
of “serendipity.”

“It was like, what do I want to 

spend my days doing, like what 
matters to me?” Heininger said. 
“And that was during the time that 
I was realizing how critical mental 
health is and its impact on society.”

Heininger may have left his job, 

but he found his calling.

* * *

When Jaimie Phelan first saw 

e-mails and fliers about the new 
Athletes Connected meetings, she 
was instantly curious. The junior 
cross country and track athlete 
didn’t say anything the first few 
times she went, but not too long 
after hearing others open up, she 
did, too.

She found out that most other 

athletes felt the same pressures 
she did.

“At a young age, a lot of athletes 

are taught to tough things out and 
fight through the pain,” Phelan 
said. “For our everyday life and 
for our own mental health, it’s not 
always the best approach to tough 
things out, and I think a lot of us 
struggle with that, too, to be able 
to take a step back and say, ‘All 
right, I need to take a day off,’ or 
‘All right, I need to rest for a bit for 
my mental health if I’m mentally 
drained.’ It’s like the same as a 
physical injury.”

She felt the same sense of 

belonging when she first saw 
the initial Athletes Connected 
presentations. 
Athletes 

Connected always shows the 
same two videos, one featuring 
Heininger and the techniques 
he used to overcome depression, 
and one featuring Kally Fayhee, 
a former Michigan swimmer who 
overcame an eating disorder.

“That hit a lot of us hard, just 

being able to hear someone else’s 
story and have them share and be 
a part of all of us, too, that gave a 
powerful message,” Phelan said. 
“It helped me open up more, 
and I wanted to go to Athletes 
Connected to help deal with any 
stressors that came on.”

After the presentations, every 

athlete took a survey, and 99 
percent indicated that the videos 
were relevant to either themselves 
or their teammates.

More stunningly, 63 percent 

of student-athletes reported that 
“emotional or mental health issues” 
had affected their performance 
in the past four weeks. That 
means that more than half of 
student-athletes realize they’re 
experiencing emotional distress.

But if more than half of the 

student-athlete 
population 
is 

affected by emotional issues on 
a regular basis, then Athletes 

Connected has a problem. Though 
the organization is still conducting 
research on student-athletes, the 
attendance at its biweekly support 
groups has dipped.

In the first meeting of 2016, only 

one student-athlete showed up.

“We keep trying to find the 

magic spot,” Hansen said. “I 
think it’s a combination of things, 
why the attendance is so low. 
I think part of it is always that 
time crunch. There just isn’t that 
perfect ideal time. … I think there’s 
still, certainly for some people, 
that fear, that stigma of, ‘I don’t 
want to go and tell all my business 
or worry what people might think 
of me.’

“But at the same time, feedback 

is really consistent that they value 
hearing 
from 
other 
students 

in other sports, not just their 
teammates, that it’s an opportunity 
to get together with other people 
who are maybe experiencing some 
of the same challenges.”

Phelan — one of the few 

athletes who has taken advantage 
of the biweekly meetings — 
wholeheartedly 
agrees. 
The 

students care about the program, 
even if they can’t always find time 
for it. This year, they decided 
that Athletes Connected would 
be the beneficiary of the athletes’ 
annual Mock Rock charity event 
on Feb. 23.

“I think everyone that I’ve 

talked to who has been to Athletes 
Connected, when they’ve left, 
they’ve all said that it’s been 
beneficial,” she said. “It’s just the 
fact that they’re trying to get more 
people to go if they want to, and 
they don’t have to be clinically 
diagnosed, just go and sit, listen, 
and you never know how much it 
can help you.”

When you first walk in to 

Barb Hansen’s office, you see a 
few words scrawled in dry-erase 
marker on her board. “Just a cold, 
dark night on Mt. Everest.”

At first glance, the words could 

mean anything. But you soon find 
out the words are applicable to 
nearly anyone who has taken on 
responsibility.

In March 2015, Dr. Alicia Crum 

gave a speech at the Depression 
on 
College 

Campuses 
Conference 
hosted by the 
University, 
Crum 
told 
a 

story about one 
especially late 
night working on her thesis, in 
which a colleague of hers consoled 
her by using that same phrase.

Hansen took note.
“When people climb Mount 

Everest, what do they expect?” 
Hansen said as she recounted 
Crum’s story. “They’re expecting 
it to be cold and miserable and 
harder than hell. … ‘I’ve chosen 
these things. Did I expect it to be 
without stress?’ Really reframing 
stress as, ‘You know, we choose 
these things and we’ll manage and 
we’ll get through.’ ”

The quote has worked for some 

of her student-athletes, allowing 
them to modify their view of stress 
to fit a healthier standpoint. It has 
stayed on the board since.

But it’s also applicable to college 

students 
everywhere. 
Though 

Athletes Connected is focused 
first on helping student-athletes, 
everyone on the team makes it 
clear that they fully intend on 
rolling it out to the general college 
population. As the de facto pioneer 
in studying student-athlete mental 

health on this grand of a scale, 
Athletes Connected wants to 
make sure they get it right first.

“Because it’s a collaboration 

between the Depression Center, 
Public Health and Athletics, we 
are able to use the momentum 
of this — which is specifically 
student-athlete mental health — 
to spill over to the rest of campus, 
high schools around the country,” 
Heininger said. “One of the things 
I’m most proud of in the past year 
is all of the interest from other 
colleges and universities.”

Added Eisenberg: “As a public 

health person, I’ve always been 
interested in having a wide impact 
on a large number of people. 
While I think the student-athlete 
population at Michigan is an 
important population, it’s still only 
900 people, which is tiny compared 
to the whole U of M community.”

In the past year, Michigan club 

sports, ROTC and the marching 
band have reached out to Athletes 
Connected, seeking information 
on how to improve their students’ 
mental health.

“I would hope that there will 

be 
really 
useful 
information 

that generalizes to the college 
population,” Hansen said. “That’s 
my hope, because even if you think 
about the larger college population, 
there’s other schools and groups 
that are also performance-based. I 
think students across campus feel 
that pressure to do really well and 
to compete.”

There 
are 
three 
athletic 

counselors at Michigan. All three 
have packed schedules.

According to Hansen, it’s a rarity 

to have three counselors working 
just for an athletic department. 
But each counselor’s workload 
indicates that it’s a necessity.

After 
Athletes 
Connected 

showed 
the 
student-athletes 

the videos featuring Heininger 
and Fayhee, 40 indicated on 
the 
post-presentation 
survey 

that they would like to make 
an 
appointment 
with 
an 

athletic counselor to address 
“immediate concerns.”

If 40 students realized they 

wanted help after watching a few 
videos, then it’s not hard to imagine 

the 
impact 

programs 
like 
Athletes 

Connected 
could 
have 

on 
campuses 

across 
the 

country.

“A lot of schools have great 

facilities and a lot of schools will 
give athletes a lot of gear, and 
‘Woo-hoo, it’s great,’ ” Heininger 
said. “But what about developing 
them as a person, what about if 
they’re not going to go pro?”

And that’s why Radovich is 

involved in Athletes Connected. 
Last year, all of the donations to 
the Garrick P. Roemer Memorial 
Fund went to the program. But 
more importantly than that, she’s 
talking about what happened to 
Garrick so other people know 
what they’re up against.

The 
stigma 
surrounding 

depression and anxiety may be 
hard to shake — especially for 
athletes — but this community is 
taking its best shot.

“If it just helps one other person 

… I think that even if Athletes 
Connected 
would 
have 
been 

here, he may still not be with us,” 
Radovich said. “But if it would 
have prevented it, I’ve got to do it. 
We have to try. We have to try to 
help other people.”

A recent study found that just 10 percent of student-athletes suffering from depression and anxiety seek help.

Athletes Connected seeks to remove the stigma from mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.

“Whether 

you’re an athlete 
or not, it hovers 

over you.”

“We have to try to 
help other people.”
