Sophomore point
guard expected to be
first-round pick
By EVERETT COOK
DailySportsEditor
It's been anticipated all sea-
son that the sophomore point
guard would leave early for the
NBA at year's end, but on Sun-
day, Burke officially announced

that he was foregoing his last
two years of eligibility in Ann
Arbor and entering the NBA
Draft.
Burke, who won all four
major player of the year awards,
had one of the best seasons
of any Wolverine in the last
decade, averaging close to 19
points and seven assists a game.
He was a big reason for
Michigan's return to national
prominence. Without him,
Michigan doesn't even come

close to advancing to the
national title game for the first
time since 1993.
It was a remarkable rise for
the Columbus, Ohio native -
out of high school, no major
scouting service had Burke
higher than the 15th best point
guard in the class of 2011. He
will leave Michigan with the
single season record for assists
and the Big Ten Player of the
Year award in tow.
Burke almost left early for

the NBA after his freshman sea-
son - one where he led the Wol-
verines to a Big Ten title - but
decided to come back to Michi-
gan to try and win a national
championship. The Wolverines
were just six points away from
that goal in their 82-76 loss to
Louisville.
"There wasn't one time that I
felt he was playing for the NBA
and not for Michigan," said
Michigan coach John Beilein.

Spring football
game draws in
fans and funds

Scrimmage raises
over $60K for Mott
Children's Hospital
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
There may be over four
months until the first official
football game for the 2013 sea-
son, but that didn't stop thou-
sands of fans clad in maize and
blue from braving the cold and,
at some points, snow to watch
the Michigan football team
scrimmage at the Mott Spring
Game.
The event - which kicked
off just after noon on Saturday
- raised over $60,000 for C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital. The
exact figure will be released in
the coming weeks.
Though the game was free
and open to everyone, dona-
tions were accepted at the door
as well as online. Since 2010, the
scrimmage has raised close to
$1 million for Mott. Drawstring
backpacks, game-day approved
stadium bench seat cushion and

passes to a preseason football
practice greeted those who were
generous enough to donate to the
cause.
The "Battle at the Big House"
men's lacrosse game against
Ohio State was also played Sat-
urday to raise money for Mott.
Hannah Ashmore, a develop-
ment officer for the University
of Michigan Health System, said
besides the dreary weather, the
fundraiser ran smoothly.
"It's definitely a successful
partnership," Ashmore said of
the various events planned col-
laborativelybetween UMHS and
the Athletics Department.
PNC Bank was the present-
ing sponsor for this year's event.
PNC President Rick DeVore, an
University alum, said the bank
became a sponsor of the event
four years ago because of PNC's
charity work with children. This
year, PNC donated $26,000, a
$1,000 increase from last year.
"We encourage our clients
and our prospects to donate to
Mott," DeVore said. "It's a great
win-win when you think about
it ... It's great to give back to the

Female students banned from frat events

44 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK
(APRIL 16,1969):
The Fraternity Presidents'
Assembly voted to ban Phi Epsilon
Pi, a co-ed fraternity, from allow-
ing female students to participate
in the group's fall rush events.
Ronald Natale, vice president of
internal fraternity affairs, argued
that female participation is not
officially recognized by Phi Epsi-
lon Pi's national organization or
the Interfraternity Council.

cuts, involvement with military
research and policies regarding
minorities.
Jon Feiger, former president
of the Michigan Student Assem-
bly, spoke to the crowd of protes-
tors about his disagreement with
University's support of military
research.
"They (the University adminis-
tration) want to turn this univer-
sity into a massive think-tank for
the government and especially the
military," Feiger said.
14 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK
(APRIL 16,1999):


tion Studies and the Institute for
Social Research compiled the first
comprehensive poll of student
opinions on affirmative action and
admissions polices at the Univer-
sity.
Fifty-one percent of the student
population stated that they did
not want race to play a role in the
admissions process, while 41 per-
cent approved of its use.
LSA sophomore Justin Schmidt
said he was against using race in
admissions.
"I'm against it ... I just feel that
any time you use race as a factor
for admission it's racism,"Schmidt
said. "You should be let in on your
own merit and quality."

Venezuelans choose between #
Chavez heir, other options

Citizens head to
the polls Sunday to
select next leader
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)
- Voters chose Sunday between
the hand-picked successor who
campaigned to carry on Hugo
Chavez's self-styled socialist
revolution and an emboldened
second-time challenger who
warned that the late president's
regime has Venezuela on the
road to ruin.
Nicolas Maduro, the long-
time foreign minister to Chavez,
pinned his hopes on the immense
loyalty for his boss among mil-
lions of poor beneficiaries of
government largesse and the
powerful state apparatus that
Chavez skillfully consolidated.
Maduro's campaign was
mostly a near-religious hom-
age to the man he called "the
redeemer of the Americas," who

succumbed to cancer March 5.
He blamed Venezuela's myriad
woes on vague plots by alleged
saboteurs that the government
never identified.
Challenger Henrique Capriles'
main campaign weapon was to
simply emphasize "the incompe-
tence of the state," as he put it to
reporters Saturday night.
Maduro, 50, was favored to
win, but his early big lead in
opinion polls was cut in half over
the past two weeks in a country
struggling with the legacy of
Chavez's management of the
world's largest oil reserves. Mil-
lions of Venezuelans were lifted
out of poverty under Chavez, but
many also believe his govern-
ment not only squandered, but
plundered, much of the $1 tril-
lion in oil revenues during his
tenure.
Venezuelans are afflicted by
chronic power outages, crum-
bling infrastructure, unfinished
public works projects, double-

digit inflation, food and medicine
shortages, and rampant crime.
Venezuela has one of the world's
highest homicide and kidnap-
ping rates.
"We can't continue to believe
in messiahs," said Jose Romero,
a 48-year-old industrial engi-
neer who voted for Capriles in
the central city of Valencia. "This
country has learned a lot and
today we know that one person
can't fix everything."
In the Chavista stronghold
of Petare outside Caracas, the
Maduro vote was strong. Maria
Velasquez, 48, who works in
a government soup kitchen
that feeds 200 people, said she
was voting for Chavez's man
"because that is what my coman-
dante ordered."
Reynaldo Ramos, a 60-year-
old construction worker, said he
"voted for Chavez" before cor-
recting himself and saying he
chose Maduro. But he could not
seem to get his beloved leader out

"We must always vote for

we're going to continue on this
path," Ramos said. He said the

ist Party of Venezuela deployed
a well-worn get-out-the-vote

state employees. It also enjoyed

of its near-monopoly on institu-
tional power.
Capriles' camp said Chavista
loyalists in the judiciary put
hem at glaring disadvantage
by slapping the campaign and
broadcast media with fines and
prosecutions that they called
unwarranted.

Group aims to show
students the effects of
fiscal, personal debt
By ALEX SCHWARTZ
For the Daily
DEBTx, a new student orga-
nization on campus, held its first
annual debt conference Friday
in South Hall.
The conference featured
seven speakers each discussing a
different aspect of debt. Discus-
sion sessions and short videos
were also featured in the con-
ference, which lasted about two
and a half hours. The purpose
of the event was to spark dis-
cussion about debt and inspire
action.
DEBTx was created by Uni-
versity alum Kinnard Hocken-
hull and Business senior Ryan
Strauss. The organization's goal
is to help students understand
the role of debt in society and to
explore it through four angles:
political, social, financial and
philosophical. Strauss said he
was pleased with the outcome of
the event.
"Today's event did a great
job of providing a multitude of
perspectives for attendees to
come to new realizations about

the role of debt in their lives
and in society at large," Strauss
said. "This process of rethink-
ing debt and its role in one's
life can be acted upon through
these emerging alternatives
(or through) traditional uses of
money."
Each of the seven speak-
ers came from different back-
grounds and offered their own
perspective on the benefits and
problems with debt in today's
world in 15-minute segments.
Business Assistant Prof. Scott
Rick discussed personal debt
and the mistakes consumers
make when managing multiple
debts.
"We need to understand
what's driving the debt prob-
lem," Rick said. "The problem is
there's a lot of ingredients, so it's
really hard to make it go away."
Public Policy and Economics
Prof. Alan Deardorff discussed
the issue of developing countries
taking on large amounts of debt.
"The institutions, the rich
countries, that want to help the
poorest of developing countries
shouldn't do it by lending the
money, that just creates prob-
lems for them later on," Dear-
dorff said.
From a business perspective,
Scott Edwardson of Edgewood
Management - a portfolio man-

agement firm - warned of the
dangers of inflation and what
the government is doing to pre-
vent it from becoming a problem.
Hodge introduced time bank-
ing, a banking system that keeps
track of service performed in
terms of hours and allows com-
munity members to give to the
community when they can and
take from the community when
they need.
Hockenhull, the co-organizer
of the event, presented on his
bitcoin exchange business, Bit-
Box. Bitcoin is a new, experi-
mental form of currency that is
decentralized and completely
digital.
LSA freshman Jeff Yu, a
member of Debtx, said the orga-
nization hopes to expand and
continue the annual conference
while also adding other events
throughout the year, including a
"Debtx Weekend."
"I think we did plant an idea,
but we could've had more room
for discussion and question and
answer," Yu said. "We're looking
into partnering up with other
organizations."
Public Policy senior Frank
Quinn said made him think dif-
ferently about debt.
"It increased salience on it for
me," said. "I'm definitely more
interested in debt now."

Program launched
to help immigrant

As lawmakers in Washing-
ton work out an overhaul of the
immigration system, a Michi-
gan-based social and economic
services agency has launched a
comprehensive program to help
immigrants open or expand
businesses.
Dearborn-based ACCESS
recently held a graduation cer-

The Detroit area, which is
home to one of the nation's larg-
est Arab populations, also has
Nigerian, Bangladeshi, Bosnian

in their entrepreneurial quest
through classes, individual busi-

Sunday.
The bus was about six miles

9/11 memorial to
begin charging $2
reservation fee
Visitors to the National Sep-

must now pay a $2 service fee to
reserve passes online or by phone.
The fee went into effect last
month, although there is no charge
for admission to the memorial
on the World Trade Center site.
There's also no charge for same-
day passes distributed on a first-
come, first-served basis.
Family members of some 9/11
victims say the fee violates the
memorial's mission.
"They're making money off
the people that died. It's disgust-

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
Prince backs new
reforms allowing
women to drive
Saudi billionaire Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal has indicated
support of allowing women there
to drive.
He says that would help the
kingdom's campaign to cut down
on the number of foreign workers.
Saudi Arabia follows an ultra-
conservative interpretation of
Islam and bans women from driv-
ing.
"The question of allowing
women to drive in Saudi Arabia
will save more than 500,000 jobs
in addition to the social and eco-
nomic benefits," the prince wrote
Sunday on his Twitter account.
Thousands of foreign workers
have been fired from their jobs
and then deported, part of a gov-
ernment campaign against for-
eigners who illegally reside and

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, center, tours the Zojoji Buddhist temple in Tokyo Sunday, April 14, 2013. The
United States and Japan on Sunday offered new talks with North Korea concerning the nation's nuclear programs.
Sec. Kerry in Japan to seek
diplomacy with North Korea

Seoul and Beijing
also stops on State
Department trip
TOKYO (AP) - The United
States and Japan opened the
door Sunday to new nuclear
talks with North Korea if the
saber-rattling country low-
ered tensions and honored past
agreements, even as it rejected
South Korea's latest offer of dia-
logue asa "crafty trick."
U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry told reporters in Tokyo
that North Korea would find
"ready partners" in the United
States if it began abandoning its
nuclear program.
Japan's foreign minister,
Fumio Kishida, also demand-
ed a resolution to a dispute
concerning Japanese citizens
abducted decades ago by North
Korean officials.
The diplomats seemed to
point the way for a possible
revival of the six-nation talks
that have been suspended for
four years.
China long pushed has for
the process to resume without
conditions. But the U.S. and
allies South Korea and Japan
fear rewarding North Korea for
its belligerence and endless rep-
etition of a cycle of tensions and
failed talks that have prolonged
the crisis.
Kerry's message of openness
to diplomacy was clear, however
unlikely the chances appeared
that North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un's government would

meet the American's conditions.
"I'm not going to be so stuck
in the mud that an opportunity
to actually get something done
is flagrantly wasted because of
a kind of predetermined stub-
bornness," he told U.S.-based
journalists.
"You have to keep your mind
open. But fundamentally, the
concept is they're going to have
to show some kind of good
faith here so we're not going to
around and around in the same-
old, same-old," he said.
Tensions have run high
on the Korean Peninsula for
months, with North Korea
testing a nuclear device and its
intercontinental ballistic mis-
sile technology.
The reclusive communist
state hasn't stopped there. It has
issued almost daily threats that
have included possible nucle-
ar strikes against the United
States. Analysts and foreign
officials say that is still beyond
the North Koreans' capability.
While many threats have
been dismissed as bluster, U.S.
and South Korean say they
believe the North in the coming
days may test a mid-range mis-
sile designed to reach as far as
Guam, the U.S. territory in the
Pacific where the Pentagon is
deploying a land-based missile-
defense system.
Japan is the last stop on a
10-day trip overseas for Kerry,
who visited Seoul and Beijing as
well in recent days.
In South Korea, he strongly
warned North Korea not to

launch a missile and he reaf-

Before returning to the
United States, Kerry planned a

So far, Republican lawmakers

Debate renews over Mich. high
school graduation requirements

Lawmakers claim
current system
doesn't allow for
trade careers
LANSING, Mich. (AP) -
Some Michigan lawmakers
are making another attempt
to change the state's high
school graduation require-
ments, which they argue do
not provide flexibility to allow
students to pursue career and
technical education programs.
Then-Gov. Jennifer Gran-
holm signed the Michigan Merit
Curriculum into law in 2006,
making the state's graduation
requirements among the tough-
est in the country. Backers said
they'd create a well-educated,
well-prepared workforce cru-
cial to the state's economic
future. But some lawmakers
say the standards are designed
for students heading to four-
year colleges, leavingthose who
want to pursue careers in con-
struction, welding and agricul-
tural science behind.
"We are not trying to degrade
the education system and cre-
ate a two-tied set of students,"
Republican Rep. Peter Pettalia
of Presque Isle told the House
Education Committee. "We
are trying to engage a group of
students we believe are falling
through the cracks."
Under the bills, students
would still need four years of
math, but would be able to sub-
stitute algebra II with statis-

tics, technical math or another
math relevant to their career
and technical education, said
Republican Rep. Ed McBroom
of Vulcan.
The bills, which are also
backed by some Democrats,
would also remove foreign lan-
guage requirements and allow
students to use extracurricular
activities to replace some phys-
ical education credits. Agri-
cultural science would be an
eligible science course. Similar
bills are pending in the Senate.
The Michigan Association
of Secondary School Principals
opposes the bills because it
says the current requirements
work. Since 2006, the state's
graduation rate has increased
by about 1 percent while the
dropout rate has decreased
by 4 percent, according to the
group.
Efforts have been made to
revise the graduation require-
ments nearly every year since
the law was signed, but the
bills never gained traction in
the Legislature. But McBroom
said changes in these bills are
so small that he thinks they
will make it through the House
this year.
The question remains
whether Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder, who in his State of the
State Address called it "unac-
ceptable" that only 17 percent
of the state's students are "col-
lege ready," would back the
changes.
"These bills do represent a
significant policy change and
so the administration will be

thoroughly reviewing them
and the impacts they could
have in our efforts to prepare
our kids for the workplace of
tomorrow," Snyder spokesman
Kurt Weiss said in an email.
McBroom told the commit-
tee that by the time students
complete the 18 required cred-
its, they usually only have
about 6 credits left for other
classes. That means students
can get boxed out of career and
technical education programs,
which has caused some schools
to stop offering such programs,
he said.
But State Superintendent
Mike Flanagan said the per-
centage of Michigan students
in career and technical educa-
tion programs has remained
flat since the curriculum was
put in place. About 7.6 percent
of Michigan students are in
these programs now, compared
to about 7.5 percent when the
requirements were set.
There is already plenty of
leeway, particularly when
it comes to algebra II, said
Wendy Zdeb-Roper, the exec-
utive director of the Michi-
gan Association of Secondary
School Principals and a former
high school principal. Stu-
dents can spread out the alge-
bra II content over two years.
Algebra II can also be embed-
ded into career and technical
classes.
Students may also follow a
personal curriculum, or an indi-
vidualized curriculum devel-
oped by the superintendent,
parents and student.

Students for city council
Mixed Use Party may fill a void in Ann Arbor politics
Tn January, a group of University students made the unexpected
move of forming a political party to run for Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil. The party, coined the Mixed Use Party, seeks to select candi-,
dates to run in four of the city's five wards. Seeing as so many of Ann
Arbor's residents are students who currently have no peer represen-
tative voice in the city's operations, the Mixed Use Party fills a long-
standing void in city politics. The party's effort to elect a student for
city council is a positive step toward involving students in the city and
spreading awareness about the particular problems students face.

Who are those Millenni-
als, anyway?
It's a question some
pollster in a
swing state is
trying to figure
out right now.
Pundits have
argued about it r
during the past
few election
cycles. Adults of MICHAEL
all occupations
are puzzling SPAETH
over it.
And everyone
seems to have an opinion about it.
New York Times columnist David
Brooks has described the Millen-
nials as "smart, hard-working,
pleasant-but-cautious achievatrons
who thrive in elite universities."
victoria Buhler, a student enrolled
in Brooks' course at Yale Univer-
sity, recently described members of
our generation as "Cynic Kids" who
"have embraced the policy revolu-
tion; they require hypothesis to
be tested, substantiated, and then
results replicated before they com-
mit to any course of action."
Brooks has also described Mil-
lennials as "risk averse," and some
Millennials have taken issue with
this characterization of our genera-
tion. Cameron Joseph, a member of
the Millennial generation, defend-
ed our supposed risk aversion by
noting that "we have much less
room for error than any previous
American generation, due to both
the economy and the constraints
that society (e.g. older generations)
have placed upon us." He wrote
that "we were brought up with zero
tolerance policies for everything
from drugs and alcohol to political
protests in school, faced the most
competitive college admittance
process ever and graduated into the
worst economic situation for young
people in nearly 80 years."
Millenials also been described
as generally progressive, particu-
larly on issues such as gay mar-
riage and climate change. Yet, at
the same time, we are characterized
as being "skeptical and even cyni-

cal" about entitlement programs
because we "don't expect (Social
Security and Medicare) to be there"
for us, former Clinton speechwrit-
er and adviser Eric Liu wrote in
Time Magazine last month. We are
societal rebels, "shar(ing) illegally
downloaded music and movies even
if the labels and studios don't want
(us) to" because we are "growing up
in a social and technological milieu
that is dismissive of large top-down
institutions and in many ways hos-
tile to elite power concentration."
Others say we're "apathetic, dis-
interested, tuned-out and selfish"
- adjectives that Chelsea Clinton
firmly dismissed in a recent op-ed.
Writing about her interactions
with Millennials at the latest meet-
ing of the Clinton Global Initiative
University, Clinton observed that
although Millennials are "obsessed
with money," "mobile maniacs,"
"social media-obsessed" and
"awfully impatient," they are using
those traits as catalysts for selfless
concrete actions that are improving

Since the mid-1970s city council has gone
without representation from University stu-
dents. Many students hold jobs, pay taxes
and vote in the city of Ann Arbor. A student
holding a city council position would greatly
increase the connection the University has
with the city and the rest of its residents.
Though their platform needs work, the
Mixed Use Party has taken the first step in
creating the necessary attention and support
for their initiative.
Unfortunately, city council members have
continuously discouraged students from run-
ningfor avarietyof reasons, includingthe fact
that the majority of students here aren't per-
manent residents. Recently, Ann Arbor city
wards were redistricted so student voters now
make up the minority in each ward. In addi-
tion, fraternities, sororities and co-ops aren't
allowed in R1, R2A or R3 districts, which
cover a large section of the city.
If elected, the Mixed Use Party needs to

address a variety of student concerns and
look beyond the issues surrounding housing
for Greek life and students in co-ops. One key
issue is rezoning districts so that students
are better represented in the city council.
The party should also campaign for more
adequate off-campus housing inspection.
Moreover, candidates chosen by the Mixed
Use Party must strive to enhance the overall
relationship between city council leaders and
the University. By creating a closer relation-
ship, students will play a more vocal role in
citywide matters.
With a large potential voter base and focus
on student issues, the Mixed Use Party has
the potential to better integrate students into
Ann Arbor. Students have the right to repre-
sentation in the city where they reside, and
there's no better place for that representation
than city council. As a major constituency of
Ann Arbor, the students' voices deserve to be
heard - loud and clear.

of poverty with little to no hope of
ever escaping it.
These are the forgotten Millenni-
als - members of our age group who
don't have smart phones, who aren't
debating what classes they should
take or what activities they can
pursue outside of class and aren't
contemplating strategies of social
activism. They are simply trying to
survive each and every day.
At the very least, these Millen-
nials deserve to be included in the
national conversation about our
generation. But we shouldn't stop
there; we should do everything in
our power to help our fellow Mil-
lennials rise above mere survival.

Speak out, or don't

Recently, while in the Central Campus Rec-
reation Building, I heard a student say "Man, we
can't beat them. They're black." I was startled at
the blatant racism of this statement, especially
in this nation, on this campus.
As someone contemplating a history major, I
reflected on the progress of race relations in our
country. I started with colonization. Many peo-
ple voyaged to America in search of religious
tolerance. They wanted to build a "city on a hill"
- a society others would emulate. However, the
first settlers quickly started harming the native
population. Later,the original U.S. Constitution
allowed the practice of slavery while counting
African Americans as three-fifths of a person.
In 1865, President Abraham Lincoln finally
banned slavery with the 13th Amendment. One
hundred years later, segregation was abolished.
Now Americans are slipping under a veil of
ignorance, believing our nation is free, equal
and colorblind. This perspective is wrong.
Immigration issues, crime rates, inner-city
problems and negative stigmas define Ameri-
ca's race problem.
I was astonished to find a stark presence of
racism on campus. Students leaving the tute-
lage of their parents for the first time can for-
mulate and espouse their own views freely.
Many, including myself, have ingrained per-
spectives and views of race that lead to biased
attitudes. Everywhere I go - the CCRB, my
classes, my dorm - I hear nonchalant racist
jokes and comments. I'm a perpetrator myself
sometimes, though I try not to be. Obviously
racist comments are dismissed as jokes, when
in reality these attitudes are anything but. I
believe many of these offhand remarks are
formed by stereotypes and observations of
society, but the habits and tendencies of other
people aren't a basis for racism.
The research I do surrounding the effects
of government agencies on racerelations has
taught me that institutionalized racism leads
to many biases and causes many of America's
societal ills, including segregated communi-
ties and poor urban neighborhoods with high
crime rates. Institutionalized racism can

clearly be seen in the criminal justice system.
A multitude of sentencing policies and puni-
tive laws were enacted after the civil rights
movement. The 1973 Rockefeller Drug Laws
in New York established harsh mandatory
sentences for those caught with illegal drugs.
More than 90 percent of those arrested under
the new laws were black or Latino Ameri-
cans. These laws were the start of a drug war,
with other states and eventually the federal
government following suit. According to The
Sentencing Project, in 2011 America incarcer-
ated more people per 100,000 than any other
country in the world. Additionally, one in
three blacks are likely to be arrested, as com-
pared to one in 17 for whites.
America's criminal justice system is clearly
facing massive challenges. High incarcera-
tion rates and even higher prison populations
are just a few of the many consequences of
our government policy. Furthermore, incar-
ceration keeps inner-city communities in
stagnant despair and reinforces harmful ste-
reotypes. The criminal justice system dispro-
portionately re-incarcerates felons as well.
According to a 2012 New York Times article,
there are approximately five million people in
the United States who have committed a felo-
ny and, as a result, are unable to vote. In this
way, the institutional racism evident in our
nation's criminal justice system exacerbates
America's problem with race.
Everyone - the government and even stu-
dents here at the University - must strive
to change the path of our country and work
toward complete freedom and equality. Stu-
dent organizations like The Detroit Partner-
ship and the Understanding Race Project are
great first steps. All stereotypes and prejudic-
es against race must be transcended by toler-
ance and acceptance. Hopefully, historians
will look back and reflect on this era asa time
when this campus, this country, became a
"city on a hill" - a society that treats all races,
all people, as equal humans.

ast week, Harsha Nahata
wrote a column in The
Michigan Daily address-
ing the silence of our generation
- "Generation
Q" for "quiet,"
according to a
New York Times
columnist. We're
not necessar-
ily ignorant or
apathetic to all
the shit that goes KATIE
on in essentially STEEN
every corner of
the world, but
eventually we reach a point where
"save the world" turns into "shit
happens." So, we become wrapped
up in our own lives. We have our
games and our shows and our Net-
flix and our beds at night that keep
us warmer than the food particles
nestled between the keys of our
Macbooks. We're watching and
we're warm, and life develops a lull-
ing pattern over which there's a hum
like a fan by your bedside - white
noise that you don't even bother to
speak over.
OK, let's all agree that apathy
is overall shitty. But I don't think
silence necessarily equates to indif-
ference. Silence isn't always a failure
to respond, but rather can be a tacti-
cal action. Sometimes it kills us to be
silent, but we do so because it seems
to be the best decision in agiven con-
text. So, when is it OK to be quiet?
Well, I'm not entirely sure, as
there are an impossible number of
combinations of events in which
a person could either speak or not
speak. More often than not, there are
other methods of action, too, beyond
speaking or not speaking. Ugh, life's
so complicated.
Let me begin with a conversation
I had last week. I was talking to my
current mentor in the School of Edu-
cation. She's pretty brilliant from
what I've gathered after a few weeks
ofsittinginher classroom andtalking
with her in the hallways amid the

Despite molestation
acuainpriest
ministered in Texas'

Court battle ensues
over release of
personnel records
LOS ANGELES (AP) - When
the Rev. John Anthony Salazar
arrived in Tulia, Texas, in 1991,
he was warmly welcomed by
the Roman Catholic community
tucked in the Texas Panhandle.
What his new parishioners
didn't know was he'd been hired
out of a treatment program for
pedophile priests - and that
he'd been convicted for child
molestation and banned from
the Archdiocese of Los Angeles
for life.
Over the next11years, Salazar
would be accused of abusingfour
more children and young men in
Texas, including an 18-year-old
parishioner who suffered teeth
marks on his genitals. Today he
awaits trial on one molestation
charge, while his accusers and
former followers seek a way to
move forward.
Many details of Salazar's past
are contained in a confidential
personnel file that was among
120 such files the Archdiocese
of Los Angeles made public this
year after a legal battle with
abuse victims. But those records
tell only part of the story.
On Tuesday, attorneys return
to court to argue over the release
of records for about 80 priests,
including Salazar, who belonged
to Roman Catholic religious
orders that kept their own per-
sonnel files on accused clergy-
men. The hearingwill address in
what form and when those files
will be made public, and involves
orders such as the Jesuits, Sale-
sians, Vincentians and Domini-
cans.
The documents are critical
to understanding the full scope
of the clergy abuse scandal, said
Ray Boucher, who represents
Los Angeles-areavictims.
As part of a separate settle-
ment, the Franciscans were
forced last year to release
confidential records on their
members who'd been accused
of molestation. The papers
revealed a culture of abuse
that affected generations of
students at the seminary dedi-
cated to training future Fran-
ciscans. Among the documents
was a "sexual autobiography"
penned by one priest as part
of a therapy assignment that
spelled out how he groomed
children for molestation from a
boys' choir that he founded.
"These orders really have a
primary role and responsibil-
ity in the transfer of pedophile
priests," Boucher said.
About 25 percent of priests
accused of abuse in Los Ange-
les belonged to religious orders.
Many had been loaned out to
the archdiocese to help with a
perpetual shortage of priests.
In some cases, Boucher said,
the orders may have sent known
pedophiles to work in the arch-
diocese in the same way that the
larger church has been accused
of shuffling around problem
priests.
J. Michael Hennigan, an
archdiocese attorney represent-
ing more than a dozen orders
involved in Tuesday's hearing,
said the orders operate as sepa-
rate entities from the archdio-

cese in financial and disciplinary
matters.
"I don't think even practic-
ing Catholics have a very clear
understanding ofwhere the lines
of authority are drawn," he said.
Salazar belonged to the Pia-
nist Fathers, a tiny order that
focuses on educating poor chil-
dren and administers several
parishes in East Los Angeles.
The order, Boucher said, still has
records on Salazar that could fill
in holes in his archdiocese file,
which begins in 1986 when Sala-
zar first was charged with abuse.
The priest was assigned to work
in the archdiocese two years ear-
lier.
Salazar was accused of
molesting children from East
LA parishes, sometimes during
camping trips and at a Piarist
residential house, according to
notes in his archdiocese file.
After Salazar was arrested, the
Piarists solicited character let-

ters from his fellow priests and
contacted an attorney who had
helped another accused priest
strike a deal to serve part of his
sentence in a residential facil-
ity.
The Piarists did not return
calls and emails to their LA
parish or their headquarters in
Miami.
Salazar pleaded guilty in
1987 to one count of oral copu-
lation and one count of lewd or
lascivious acts with a child for
molesting two altar boys, ages
13 and 14. He served three years
of a six-year prison term before
being sent in 1990 to a residen-
tial program in New Mexico that
treated pedophile priests. He
was also required to register asa
sex offender.
One year later, the Diocese
of Amarillo hired Salazar and
assigned him to a vast, rural par-
ish in the Panhandle while he
was still on parole.
Los Angeles Cardinal Roger
Mahony, who has been criti-
cized for not doing more to
stop abuse when he led the
archdiocese, acted swiftly with
Salazar. He revoked the priest's
right to work within the arch-
diocese in 1986, the same day
he learned of molestation accu-
sations.
However, Mahony was unable
to prevent Salazar's transfer to
Texas because he belonged to
the Piarists and ultimately fell
outside of the cardinal's author-
ity. Mahony did write Bishop
Leroy Matthiesen in Amarillo to
warn him of Salazar's conviction
but couldn't dissuade his col-
league.
"You must thinkI don't screen
applicantswell. I assure you I do,
and that I have rejected a num-
ber of them," Matthiesen wrote
Mahony in a Jan. 28, 1992, letter
contained in Salazar's archdio-
cese file. "The Diocese of Ama-
rillo has 38 parish priests and
38,000 registered Catholics. ... I
am able to keep careful tabs on
all our priests."
Matthiesen died in 2010, but
in an autobiography he defended
his decision to hire molesting
priests from the aftercare pro-
gram, sayingtheyhad "repented,
paid the price, were rehabilitat-
ed, stayed within the boundaries
laid out for them."
"These are the types of priests
I accepted into the diocese," he
wrote. "I have no regrets for
having done so."
While not mentioning Sala-
zar specifically, Matthiesen said
he took in problem priests from
three dioceses, as well as several
other "self-admitted" molesters.
A spokesman for the Amarillo
diocese did not return a phone
message. Salazar also declined
comment.
In Texas, Salazar served as
pastor of the Church of The Holy
Spirit in Tulia, a cattle and cot-
ton farming community of about
5,000 people in Swisher County,
and also oversaw Catholic mis-
sions in the nearby towns of
Kress and Silverton. A religious
figure serves an important role
in such places, said Kirk Wil-
liams, criminal investigator for
the county attorney.
"In these small towns, you
don't have the money for psy-
chiatrists, marriage counselors
and things that a priest and a
preacher could take care of," he

said.
Four parishioners have
accused Salazar of molesting
them in Texas. A civil lawsuit
filed by three victims dates the
earliest abuse to 1991, not long
after Salazar's arrival. The
claims, which were settled con-
fidentially in 2006 and 2007,
allege Salazar molested two
boys in the Tulia church rec-
tory.
The third plaintiff's allega-
tions, made after Salazar had
been removed from active
ministry in 2002, were tried
criminally. In 2005, Salazar
was convicted of sexually
assaulting the 18-year-old man
at a wedding in Dallas County.
Salazar denied the claim, but
the man got a hospital rape
exam and had bite marks and
bruises on his genitals. Salazar
was sentenced to life in prison
and, soon after, was defrocked
by the Vatican.

be absent due to an unexpected
NFL event - said he had a similar
confession to make: he's addicted
to candy.
"Any kind of candy, I love. My
mom had a problem with me eat-
ing candy, so I like sneaking it
now," Robinson said.
Howard said over time, he has
really learned the importance of
giving one's time to others.
"I think one thing that we take
for granted when we're younger
is time and the time that people
give to us," Howard said. "I think
when I was younger Ijust took for
granted the amount of time that
maybe coaches, people of that ilk,
spent with me, and now I value it
much more."
Curzan later asked the three
panelists how they decided on the
form of their large-scale philan-
thropic work.
Howard said his desire to help
children came from his younger
BURKE
From Page 1A
"He probably thought about it
from time to time, when coach
had him going to study hall or up
in the morning running, but at
the same time, his focus in prac-
tice and the games was, 'How can
I help Michigan now?'
"It was the right formula to
help his career in the long run."
Burke is the second point
guard in three years to leave Ann
Arbor early, joining Darius Mor-
ris, who left after the 2010-11
season. Morris fell to the second
round before being drafted by his
current team, the Los Angeles
Lakers.

community."
Current and former patients
from Mott were invited to attend
the game, where they were seat-
ed on the field with parents and
friends.
Andrea Quigg's son, Jett, 8, is

brother and his mother's in-home
daycare.
"Coach Schembechler always
had us go to Mott Children's
Hospital and volunteer, and even
when we were going to the Rose
Bowl, we would spend Christ-
mas day at the children's hospital
before we got onthe plane," How-
ard said.
"I wish I had the money like
Stephen M. Ross, so I really could
give back to the University,"
Howard joked. "There are dif-
ferent ways to give back though,
without writing the check, and
you can connect the dots and
whether it's Denard, whether
it's Dhani, whether it's Charles
Woodson - you can connect the
dots and financially we've helped
to raise a whole lot of money for a
whole lot of causes at the Univer-
sity of Michigan."
Jones, who runs his own char-
ity named The Bowtie Cause,
echoed Howard, noting that his
time at the University taught him
about the need to always give
back.
With a draft class that's
expected to be much weaker this
year than last, it makes sense that
Burke decided to leave. This is
also the case for the other three
Wolverines with an NBA Draft
decision to make - freshmen for-
wards Mitch McGary and Glenn
Robinson III, as well as junior
guard Tim Hardaway Jr. - who
are expected to make their deci-
sions in the next two weeks.
"Trey Burke's decision today is
more of a reason for celebration,"
said assistant coach Bacari Alex-
ander. "Trey's done a tremendous
job of gathering information and
making an educated decision
with the people he trusts, and
quite frankly, coach Beilein is
very transparent in the process,
being treated at Mott for hydro-
cephalus, a condition- in which
an abnormal amount of fluid is
present in the brain. Quigg said
Jett and his family couldn't pass
up the opportunity to be with
friends and support their team.
"We were always Michigan
fans, but when your son is cared
for here, you kind of bleed blue,"
Quigg said.

"Getting involved with Mott
Children's Hospital really set
the groundwork for a lot of stu-
dent athletes that are here at the
University, something that Lloyd
Carr definitely instilled within
us," Jones said. "I think from a
University perspective, under-
standing that it is a greater good,
and it's something that's not
about you, it's something that's
bigger than yourself."
Robinson also discussed the
fulfillment he gets from helping
others, adding that his path from
growing up in a low-income fami-
ly to becoming a star quarterback
for Michigan has taught him to
give back.
"Like breathing, it's something
that you expect to do all the time,"
Robinson said. "I know I grew up
in a family that was unfortunate,
so anytime that I have a chance
to give back to anybody that's not
fortunate, to give back to anybody
I can talk to or be around, I want
to make their day. I want to make
somebody's day everyday."
Jones said A+R represents a
so I think those guys have great
clarity when they decide."
Added Beilein: "If you recruit
well enough, and develop players
well enough, this is inevitable.
We embrace it. We have no other
choice but to embrace it and try
to guide young men through it."
Burke's height is a draft con-
cern - listed at just 6-feet tall,
he's short for an NBA point
guard. But Burke more than
makes up for it with an explosive
first step and terrific quickness.
Burke said that he's expecting
to go in the top 15 of the draft, but
several mock drafts have him in
the top 10, and some even in the
top five.
"He's always been a winner,"
said assistant coach Lavall Jor-

"I think that we are all in this
room because we believe that
it's about Michigan," Jones said.
"I think regardless of whatever
position or whatever place you've
been in this University, it's about
the school. It's about the differ-

He entered Ann Arbor as a

"Trey never wavered on his
dedication to the program,"
Alexander said. "From the time
he walked through the doors to
today's press conference, here's
a young man who was demon-
strated what poise personified is.
It's almost as if he's destined for
greatness on some level."
Breaugh said after the game that
he played because of the cama-
raderie he feels not only with his
former teammates, but with the
University community in general.
"You come back because from
the day we were all here, Michi-
gan football has been a family,"
Breaugh said. "That's what makes
this place special. That's what's
made Michigan, Michigan."

activities put on by University
student organizations. In accor-
dance with the theme of this
year's fair, "K-Zoo," organizers
created habitat-themed zones,
such as jungle, safari, arctic and
underwater.
This year, 60 student orga-
nizations hosted booths at the
event, down from last year's total
of 80 student organizations.
Thirteen elementary schools
from Detroit, Ypsilanti, Willow

Run and Ann Arbor participat-
ed in the pen pal program and
attended the Kids Fair.
Education senior Amanda
Webster, executive director of
K-grams, said the intent of the
Kids Fair is to show the students
the benefits of higher education
in a fun environment.
"A lot of the schools we work
with are lower socio-economic
status, Title 1 schools with free
or reduced lunch," Webster
said. "It's sort of a self-fulfilling
prophecy that these kids don't
have family members who went
to college, they don't see it."

The Michigan Marching Band
hosted a booth where children
could try out a horn, trombone,
trumpet or piccolo. The Uni-
versity's chapter of the Ameri-
can Chemical Society hosted a
booth that showed the children
how to make lava lamps, and the
University's Dance Team taught
them dance routines with pom-
poms.
Webster said she wanted to
show the kids that college is pos-
sible for them. She said the pen
pal program and Kids Fair will
help the kids imagine them-
selves on a college campus.

LSA junior Michelle Franklin
coordinates the K-Grams pen
pal program for West Quad Resi-
dence Hall, where she is a Resi-
dent Advisor.
"I have a passion for learning,"
Franklin said. "It is cool because
I get to write to them every week
and rub off on them."
Ten-year-old Olivia- Lee, a
student at Mitchell Elementary
School in Ann Arbor, said she
loved the Kids Fair because it
was the culmination of her cor-
respondence with her pen pal.
"I get to see my pen pal and
learn lots of cool stuff," Lee said.

New Netflix show
does no good

'Bad Samaritans' is
a weak attempt at
original comedy
By RADHIKA MENON
DailyArts Writer
Netflix is expanding. What
started with cult excitement
in the announcement of an
"Arrested
Development" (C
resurrection
quickly moved Bad
to actual origi- SmaritanS
nal program-
ming - most Netflix
noteworthy of
which is the
political thriller "House of
Cards." The online streaming
service is branching out, now try-
ing its hand at original comedy.
Unfortunately, unlike its prede-
cessors, "Bad Samaritans" is far
from brilliant.
After Jake (Brian Kubach,
"Piranha") and Drew's (Julian-
na Guill, "Crazy Stupid Love")
anniversary-turned-breakup
ends with a park fire, the duo
is sentenced to 2,000 hours of
community service. They meet
a bunch of weirdos during their
time, including a socialite look-
ing for a sugar daddy, a stoner

with no plans of ever leaving this
gig and a tattooed ex-biker with
good intentions. It's an interest-
ing take on the group-based com-
edies that have recently become
the go-to formula in the genre,
but sadly there's no spark here.
A nursing home is the back-
drop of the pilot, forcing Jake
and Drew to explore their broken
relationship in the face of Drew's
grandmother who is a resident
there. The former couple dili-
gently avoids telling her about the
breakup, and instead takes mat-
ters to the other extreme.
The community service angle
allows the location of the series to
be forever undetermined, adding
fresh scenery to every episode.
However, this ever-changing set-
ting makes it impossible to cre-
ate a solid secondary cast beyond
the core group of community
servants. If we're likening it to
"Arrested Development," this
means that there is no Gene Par-
mesan, no Ann Veal and no Steve
Holt. What makes a lot of com-
edies stand out is the strength of
the supporting cast - often they
are the true cult clinchers.
Without this important group,
"Bad Samaritans" must rely sole-
ly on the talents of the core group,
and mainly Drew and Jake. Jake
is the typical underachieving
boyfriend while Drew is the

uptight borderline bitch who
has had enough in the relation-
ship; there's nothing new here.
The characters are bland, and
their close proximity and banter-
ing will undoubtedly bring them
back together by series' end. Bo-
ring.
The main problem with "Bad
Samaritans" is that it's just not
funny. The jokes are flat, the
characters are dull and the act-
ing is extremely forced. The lack
of advertising and low produc-
tion value makes it almost certain
that Netflix wasn't channeling
much money into this project,
and it shows. You don't necessar-
ily need A-list actors like Kevin
Spacey a la "House of Cards,"
but you do need quality writing,
directing and producing - all of
which "Bad Samaritans" lacks.
While the premise is a fresh
take on the sub-genre of group
comedies, "Bad Samaritans"
lacks the comedic element nec-
essary for success. A series like
this with a lot of potential would
be better served with more crisp
writing, and realized and distinct
characters.
Netflix has shown that it has
the ability to create and develop
meaningful and exciting drama
series. If only it would put the
same energy and effort into
everything that they produce.

Baldwin's name originally came
into the late night discussion as a
possible replacement for Carson
Daly, whose 1:35 a.m. "Last Call"
has very quietly made it 12 sea-
sons on the network. However,
this proved only to be specula-
tion when "Last Call with Carson
Daly" was renewed for a 13th sea-
son on April 10.
Similar to 2009, Jay Leno didn't
exactly step down from "The
Tonight Show" as much as he was
forced out. Strange, considering
"The Tonight Showwith JayLeno"
continues to be the most-watched
program in late-night. However,
like most television shows, it's not
about how many people watch -
it's about how many young people
watch.
In that regard, neither Leno or
his broadcast rivals, David Let-
terman and Jimmy Kimmel, are
winning the ratings race. During
the first quarter of 2013, in the key
18-49 demographic, Comedy Cen-
tral emerged as the big winner:
"The Daily Show with Jon Stew-
art" and "The Colbert Report"
were the No. 1 and No. 2 shows,
respectively.While Stewart has the
advantage of airing30minutes ear-
lier - in direct competition with
only "Conan" and "Chelsea Lately"
- Colbert goes head-to-head with
Leno, Letterman and Kimmel.
Though Leno was a strong No. 3
on the list, with only 60,000 view-
ers separating him and Colbert,
NBC has been grooming Fallon as
his replacement for some time now.
Fallon is NBC's investment for the
future, and with "Jimmy Kimmel
Live" now airing an hour earlier,
it's time Fallon makes the move as
well.
At only 62 years old, there's
no telling what Leno's next move
could be. He has a very loyal fan
base andcould easily set up at a dif-
ferent network - rumor has it he's
been fielding offers from many. But
NBC seems ready for a change,
and with the potential lineup of
Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers,
they could end up with the fresh-
est and funniest duo inlate night.

Louis still king of comedy

I don't cry when I
watch TV

Famed comedian
as vulgar as ever on
'Oh My God'
By MAX RADWIN
Daily Fine Arts Editor
Louis C.K.'s fourth HBO com-
edy special, "Oh My God" pre-
miered this Sunday with more
hype than it
could possibly B+
live up to. Nev-
ertheless, the Oh My God
most popular
and successful Special
stand-up come- HBO
dian of the last
decade (does
"C.K." stand for "Comedy King"?
It's starting to look that way)
delivered another solid hour of
ingeniously filthy jokes.
C.K.'s comedy specials seem to
age like a fine wine. This one too
looks promising for a second and
third listen-through when he puts
it up on his website for five dollars
in September. But for now, "Oh My
God" just isn't as "hilarious" in the
sense of the word that C.K. so bril-
liantly tore apart in his third, and
perhaps best, album, and which
forces audiences to hold him to
such an incredibly high standard.
There are countless moments
when C.K. is at his best, though. If
possible, he has actually improved
at being vulgar. It's almost thera-
peutic or refreshing to laugh at
his twistedness - like he's giving
everyone a much-needed break
from riding their moral, politically
correct high horse. Who else can
make a joke out of killing an old
blind dog, the benefits of slavery
and suffocating a kid in a plastic
bag? (Of course, it's funnier when
he tells it). Somehow, he manages
to use this level of vulgarity with-
out second thought and in jokes
that are flat-out brilliant.
In the rare moments that wane,
or during the bits that just aren't
as sidesplitting, that brilliance is
still there. That's what separates
C.K. from any run-of-the-mill
John Caparulo: There is always a
profundity to what he is saying -
that what is being talked about, in
his best joke or worst, has a sense
of importance and relevance.
Like any good joke should, his
topics shine a spotlight on some

don't cry when I watch TV.
When asked what movie
or show makes me cry, I
laugh. "None of them," I say, met
with disbelief.
I've read
studies and
psychology
articles on
whypeople
cry when they
watch TV
shows, hop- KAYLA
ing to reverse UPADHYAYA
engineerthe
explanations
and come up with a succinct
answer for whyI - someone who
has seen more onscreen breakups,
breakdowns, deaths and despair
than the average human - can't
get those tear ducts flowing. Most
give the obvious explanation:
empathy.
I saythat's bullshit. My dry
eyes aren't for lack of emotional
connection. I feel for fictional
characters to what some might
call an unhealthy degree. My
friend Christian overheard me
talking to another friend about
how all I wanted was for Blair
Waldorf to be happy, and the
fervor in my voice convinced him
I was talking about someone I
knew and not the Queen B of the
CW's "Gossip Girl." I got more
mad at a friend for calling Betty
Draper a "cunt" than I did when
a group of my friends forgot my
birthday in seventh grade. The
emotions are there - the physical
response is not.
I don't cry when I watch TV,
but ifI did, here are the thingsthat
would make me cry:
Vampires. Iwish I were kid-
ding, butthe number oftimes I've
overflown with emotion over a
damnvampire show, of all things,
now surpasses the number of
times I've had to explain why
"True Blood" sucks. So, no, Alex-
ander Skarsgard can'tquite crack
my hardened interior, but plenty of
other fanged folkshave done the
trick, like in seasontwo of "The
Vampire Diaries,"when Elena
walks to the top of a hill with her
longtime vampire boyfriend Stefan
and tells him she's only a17-year-
old girl, she has her whole life in
front of her, and she doesn't want
to be a vampire. Or inthe following
season when Caroline explains to
her father- who's ironically gay -
that he can't make her vampirism
go away.
Musical montages. Every.
Damn. Time. Score ascenewith a
power ballad fromthe early2000s,
and you've got me. "Revenge" and
"Pretty Little Liars" consistently
exploitthis weakness.
Bitches breakingdown. My
favorite characters on most shows

aren't quick to cry. So, when they
doit'spowerful. The first time
I saw Olivia Pope shed a tear on
"Scandal," I thought the world was
ending.
Anything and everything
Jason Katims has ever touched.
At Paleyfest this year, when panel
host Michael Ausiello asked
Katims - the manbehind"Friday
Night Lights" and "Parenthood"
-if he and his writers make con-
scious effort to include at least
one tearjerker moment in every
"Parenthood" script, he said no.
The writers, Katims explained, are
always surprised by the scenes that
end up carrying the most emo-
tional weight. "Parenthood"brims
with in-your-face sadness like
Kristina telling the family about
her cancer diagnosis and recording
a farewell to her children. But the
more subtle moments linger with
me long after an episode ends,like
Julia learning Spanish so she can
connect with Victor or Max final-
ly gettingthatngoddamn vending
machine back in his school.
No tears, but
plenty of feels.
I don't cry when I watch TV,
but I came pretty close one time.
Two summers ago, I was living
alone in Jackson, Mich. I spent my
AC-less evenings with my good
friend, Netflix. Iwas in the midst
of my first straight-through view-
ing of "Buffy." My friend LaToya
had warned me that season five
was one of the series's most emo-
tionally tumultuous, butnothing
could have prepared me for "The
Body," an episode full of death,
grieving, silence and intimate
camerawork. All it took was an
1,100-year-old vengeance demon
discovering the absoluteness of
death to break me. A single tear
rolled downmy nose onto my bare
knee. "Kayla's First Tear," my
friend called it.
I don't cry when I watch TV. Or
when I read books or see movies.
I don't cry when I say goodbyes or
I'll-miss-yous. Only in very rare
instances of emotional release do
tears escape the crevasses of my
too-dark eyes. My friends call me
robot, cyborg, Cylon.
But 0 promise you, I feel Just
watch me watch any show helmed
by Joss Whedon and you'll see a
jolt of emotion surgethrough my
center. "Ohmygod," you'll say, just
like all my housemates do. "Are
you going to cry?!"
Don'tgetyourhopes up.
Upadhyaya is definitely

FX

Livin' the life.
truth of society, but it's a truth
that always seems to exist beyond
just his own fat, white-guy point
of view, and which you will inevi-
tably encounter yourself when
standing in an elevator, watching
seals at the zoo or, as C.K. sug-
gests, filming your own asshole
for 20 minutes to put on Face-
book.
While "Shameless," "Chewed
Up" and "Hilarious" are now
untouchable hours of comedy,
"Oh My God" joins "Live at the
Beacon Theater" and "WORD:
Live at Carnegie Hall" as C.K.'s
second-tier specials, though still
worlds above most. Perhaps "Oh
My God" lacks the specificity of

these earlier albums, in which
C.K. would delve into lengthy,
situational tangents that layer
brilliant observation on top of
brilliant observation. Some jokes
feel like they are abandoned
early, or cut short by the man
who usually takes things too far.
Sure, you've got Sigourney Weav-
er breast-feeding, but it's just not
quite the same as the detailed
recounting of a 4-year-old slip-
ping and falling in a pile of her
own shit.
If you've watched only one of
C.K.'s stand-up specials or even
just a single episode of "Louie,"
you'd know that he loves
his kids. His two daughters

undoubtedly come up in each
of his albums and like every-
thing else that comes out of his
mouth, it's funny without fail.
But they are much less pres-
ent in "Oh My God." It's almost
as if there isn't anything more
for C.K. to say about them. The
absurdity of a 9-year-old is just
not different enough from the
absurdity of an 11-year-old to
keep it fresh. And five years
removed from divorce, C.K.'s
relationship status threatens to
bear this same staleness. Just
wait until he remarries, or his
kids hit puberty, get boyfriends
and start smoking weed. That's
going to be one hell of an album.

E FILM REVIEW
Underdog story warms
hearts in'Sapphires

FOCUS
"Drive 2"
'Pines' lacks power

Gosling dominates
in overly ambitious
tale of morality
By AKSHAY SETH
Daily B-Side Editor
For the first two minutes of
Derek Cianfrance's ("Blue Val-
entine") "The Place Beyond
the Pines,"
Luke Glanton B
(Ryan Gos-
ling, "Drive") The Place
remains face-
less. All we getB
is an unidenti- the Pines
fied hero mov- At State
ing forward.
We don't know Focus
who he is, what
he's about to do
or why he's about to do it. For the
first and only time in the film, the
consequences are irrelevant.
We move with Glanton, and
there's a certain thrill in the
motion being meaningless.
As he pulls on a torn Metallica
shirt, exhales a puff of cigarette
smoke and dons his black motor-
cycle helmet, his face finally
becomes visible. He stares at the
Globe of Death, his eyes shifting
between nonchalance and the
calm that comes with routine.
Death is beckoning, but there are
no responsibilities, and again,
the consequences are irrelevant.
The rest of the film is a differ-
ent story. Drawn out, overdra-
matic, yet unquestionably epic,
an obvious theme ties together
the 140-minute affair: penal-
ties. Glanton, upon learning that
he's the father of an illegitimate
son with ex-lover Romina (Eva
Mendes, "Girl in Progress"),
quits his job as a motorcycle
stuntman and resorts to robbing
banks with new-found partner

Robin (Ben Mendelsohn, "Ani-
mal Kingdom").
But with criminality comes
the dampening embrace of the
law. A haphazard bank robbery is
followed by a searing five-minute
chase, and as the film introduces
us to rookie officer Avery Cross
(Bradley Cooper, "Silver Linings
Playbook"), it begins its steady
descent into mediocrity.
As is visible in the excessive
number of close-ups, faces take
on a haunted look and seem gen-
uinely affected by the impacts of
what's unfolding around them,
but Cianfrance squanders any
moral weight he's able to develop
by never really resolving his cli-
max. It's as if someone throws
a lit match at a canister full of
flammable gas only for it to fizzle
out before ever making contact.
In short, nothing really hap-
pens.
To some degree, this can be
expected from Cianfrance, who's
known for leaving audiences in a
state of uncertainty, which isn't
always a bad thing. His previous
film, "Blue Valentine," was a poi-
gnant, sad commentary on life's
cruel way of stifling romance -
specifically~so because it chose
to leave many of the questions it
raised unanswered.
In "Pines," Cianfrance tries
hard to tie together the multiple
themes guiding his sprawling,
multi-generational narrative,
but because it's so damn big,
any attempt to wring meaning
out of the story feels half-assed
and unsatisfying. Of the many
vaguely broached topics of dis-
cussion, perhaps the most vex-
ing is the clumsy approach taken
when addressing the underly-
ing impacts of fatherhood. What
should be the ultimate repre-
sentation of the ripples of our
actions drifting into the future
is just left hanging in the air, like

an unnecessary formality. It's as
if someone actually thought that
having one of the characters say,
"I guess he'll grow up without a
father now" would be enough to
tackle the whole daddy-problems
dynamic.
As the film jumps forward 15
years and reintroduces us to the
sons of our two protagonists,
the reverberations never really
become apparent. Sure, both
the kids are fucked up, but we're
expected to assume the reasons
why, and by making us do so, the
script marginalizes the complex-
ity of what led us there.
Surprisingly, none of the per-
formances ever come close to
veering in the same direction
(unless, of course, you count any
of the female leads, who were
written off, sidelined and for-
gotten halfway through). Coo-
per does his best to channel the
erratic explosiveness that got him
so much praise for "Silver Linings
Playbook," but it's obvious that
this film belongs to Gosling.
His role will be compared to
his work in "Drive," and in many
contexts, the comparison is valid.
The crucial difference that's so
apparent in this movie is the dra-
matic shift in character he's able
to bring to the forefront when he
discovershehassomeonedepend-
ing on him. Gosling measures a
cornered sense of excitement in
his demeanor whenever he's close
to his son - an excitement eerily
mirrored in the moments before
he realizes he won't pull off his
last bank robbery.
Eventually,it'sthissameuncer-
tainty, a diffidence that comes
hand-in-hand with responsibil-
ity, that makes "The Place Beyond
The Pines" a flawed but com-
pelling movie. We're still mov-
ing with it, but toward the end,
there's no thrill in the motion
being meaningless.

and their cousins Cynthia and Kay
(newcomers Miranda Tapsell and
Shari Sebbens).
Victims of racial prejudice in
their hometown, the girls are

of their skin and showcase their
musical talents to the world. Dur-

the girls meet a drunk, Irish talent

one fly toward the rightsidelines,
showing off the arm strength
that wowed scouts before his
arrival in Ann Arbor three years
ago.
Freshman wide receiver
Amara Darboh made the over-
the-shoulder catch for a gain of
29 yards. After the scrimmage,
Gardner brought up the play and
smiled, saying that he liked to
throw the ball deep.
One play, insignificant in the

context of the season, but in
April, a big indicator of how this
team and this offense is going to
run.
Last year, Gardner's role on
this team was a little more mud-
dled. He played in the Spring
Game as a quarterback but
switched to wide receiver in the
summer, only to be thrust into
the starting quarterback role
after then-senior Denard Robin-
son suffered an elbow injury on

Oct. 27.
He did well, but it wasn't his
team. Robinson, the star quarter-
back and the face of the program,
was still in the picture even with
the injury.
Now, there's no more Robin-
son, and nobody else above Gard-
ner on the depth chart - it's his
squad, his offense and his posi-
tion.
Stats aren't kept for the spring
game, but unofficially, Gardner

finished 11fori16 for 145 years and
one touchdown.
"It's his throne now," said
fifth-year senior safety Thomas
Gordon. "That will definitely
make him feel better back there.
I could see it in his play in the
spring, he's a lot more comfort-
able back there and has taken
control of the offense. It's really
exciting."
Behind him isa cast of relative
unknowns. The presumed back-

up, redshirt sophomore Russell
Bellomy, tore his anterior cru-
ciate ligament last month, and
highly touted incoming fresh-
man Shane Morris hasn't arrived
in Ann Arbor yet.
So at the SpringGame, thatleft
redshirt freshman Brian Cleary
and redshirt junior Alex Swieca
as the two Wolverines behind
Gardner. Both have never seen
a minute of game action, and

Clark on defense
and Gallon
on offense
By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
One is a freak, the other a
runt. Junior Frank Clark is a
274-pound behemoth at defen-
sive end. Fifth-year senior
Jeremy Gallon is a 5-foot-8
speedster at receiver.
In stature, the two are
opposites. But with the loss

of Michigan's two playmakers
from 2012 - Denard Robin-
son to graduation and redshirt
junior linebacker Jake Ryan to
injury - each has become the
most exciting player on the
field. And in Saturday's Spring
Game, each was the player to
watch on his side of the ball.
Redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner took Gallon to
his church a few weeks ago. A
young fan approached Gallon.
"A little kid walked up
and was like, 'Hey you play
high school. I'm going to
high school too!' " Gardner

recalled, laughing. "I was like,
'Ooh. Gonna have to get a little
bigger, a little taller or lift or
something, you know?"'
Then Gardner introduced
Gallon to the pastor. The pas-
tor didn't recognize Gallon. He
pegged the receiver at 6-foot-3.
"That just speaks a lot for
the way he plays and how
tough he is and how big he
actually plays."
Gallon is so short that
diminutive senior receiver
Drew Dileo likes to remind the
press that at 5-foot-I0, Dileo
is actually two inches taller

than his teammate. "Don't let
him tell you differently," Dileo
says.
But when Robinson went
out with an injury last year,
Gallon filled the big-play void.
In Michigan's last five games,
with Gardner as quarterback,
Gallon caught 31 passes for 511
yards and three touchdowns.
In the Outback Bowl against
South Carolina, Gallon hauled
in nine passes for 145 yards
and three touchdowns.
Again on Saturday, Gallon
was Gardner's favorite target.

Orange jerseys
ignored, at least on
Saturday
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
The orange was supposed to
have said it all.
After backup quarterback Rus-
sell Bellomy, a redshirt sophomore,
tore his anterior cruciate ligament

in practice on March 29, the Mich-
igan coaching staff wasn't going to
risk any more injuries before the
2013 season actually started.
Protection, then, became the
top priority. At practices and at
Saturday's Spring Game, all the
quarterbacks, from the starter
(redshirt junior Devin Gardner) to
the third stringer (redshirt sopho-
more Alex Swieca), wore orange
jerseys in hopes that the team
could stay healthy.

SportsMonday: The Annual Schefter Awards

h, what a year.
What began with the
Cowboys Classic on Sept.
1ended a week ago, when the
Michigan men's basketball fell,
82-76, to Louisville in the national
championship game in Atlanta.
The days and months in
between offered some of the more
spectacular seasons of Michigan
athletics we've seen in a very, very
long time. It was a fun year to
watch, and it'll
be a fun one to
remember.

er, one of The

esteemed NESBITT
alumni, these
awards honor
the best of Michigan athletics in
the last year. Schefter worked as

1980s and currently serves as

Without further ado, we offer
you the 2013 Schefters.
Best Cinderella Story: Michigan
volleyball team
Despite fielding only one senior
on its roster, despite playing in the
toughest conference in the NCAA
and despite plummeting from the
national rankings after a 4-7 start
to conference play, the Michigan
volleyball team endured.
On Dec. 13, the unranked
Wolverines faced off against No.
3 Texas at the KFC Yum! Center
in Louisville. The journey to that
game, the program's first Final
Four appearance, though, was just
about as unlikely as they come.
Michigan, disgruntled and
disjointed, had slowed to a mid-
season crawl and had quickly
fallen out of contention for the
Big Ten title. But with more than
a handful of ranked opponents
lying ahead on the schedule, the
Wolverines rallied. They had no
other choice.
Michigan won 11 of its final 13
games to reach the Final Four,
defeating No. 4 Nebraska, No.10
Minnesota, No. 14 Ohio State, No.
9 Louisville and No. 2 Stanford
along the way to set up a meeting
with the third-ranked Longhorns.
A quick advantage in the Final
Four evaporated, and Texas won
in five sets to end Michigan's
season and surprise run. But
returning an almost-identical
lineup next year means this team

shouldn't be trying to fit into the
glass slipper at all next year.
Breakout Athlete of the Year:
Connor Jaeger, men's swimming
and diving
"I came to Michigan a nobody."
Connor Jaeger, a junior from
New Jersey, is never content.
Unquestionably successful, yet
unquestionably humble.
An unheralded sophomore a
year ago, Jaeger took the swim-
ming world by storm last sum-
mer. Jaeger qualified for the U.S.
Olympic Team in the 1,500-meter
freestyle and placed sixth in the
event finals at the Olympics in
London.
But that wasn't the mountain-
top for Jaeger, it was just a stop
alongthe way. After a week to rest
at home, it was back to the grind.
Above the double doors in Can-
ham Natatorium, he explained,
there's an inscription that spells
out his motivation.
"It's not every four years," the
banner reads. "It's every day."
Thanks in part to Jaeger's suc-
cess in the pool, the Michigan
men's swimming and diving team
stayed atop the national rankings
for much of the season and, on
March 30, the Wolverines cap-
tured their 12th national title -
their first since 1995.
Jaeger, a junior, captured two
titles over the same weekend
in Indianapolis, becoming the
NCAA champion in the 500-yard
freestyle and 1,650-yard freestyle.
He was a nobody, sure, but that
all changed in a hurry.
Best single-event performance:
Women's track and field distance
medley relay
Some records are meant to be
broken. And some of those are
meant to be broken by the same
people, a week later.
In early March, the Michigan
women's track and field team's
distance medley relay team of
seniors Rebecca Addison and
senior Jillian Smith, fifth-year
senior Amanda Eccleston and
freshman Maya Long set a pro-
gram record in the distance-med-
ley relay, finishing with a time of
9:56.66.
A week later, theybroke it
again, setting the bar at 9:56.46,
behind a strong push in the third
and fourth legs by Smith and
Eccleston.
And this time it was to secure
a national championship, Michi-
gan's first title in the event since
1995. Each member of the dis-

Game of the Year: Men's bas-
ketball - Michigan 87, Kansas 85
(OT)
This one won't soon be forgot-
ten.
The game - four-seed Michi-
gan and one-seed Kansas in the
Sweet Sixteen - encapsulated the
beauty and improbability of the
Big Dance.
Downby 14 with a handful of
minutes left on the clock, Michi-
gan star Trey Burke began to
finally mount a comeback. It was
a prayer, then it was a long shot,
then it was a really, really long
shot.
With five seconds on the clock,
the sophomore guard shifted
behind a screen and pulled up
for a 30-foot jumper to tie. That
shot, Michigan's "one shining
moment," of course, went in.
Burke, ice cold in the first
half, scored all 23 of his points
in the second half and overtime.
Michigan rode the momentum to
an 87-85 victory and the Wolver-
ines' first Elite Eight berth since
the Fab Five ruled the roost two
decades ago.
Team of the Year: Men's swim-
ming and diving
Now, most will give this cate-
gory to the men's basketball team,
but that's an oversight.
The men's swimming and div-
ing team has been a powerhouse
for decades, producing elite ath-
letes year after year. But a nation-
al championship had eluded the
program since 1995, and of the
Wolverines' 11 national champi-
onships, only one had come in the
last 50 years.
So the senior leadership of the
swimming and divingteam sat
down early in the season and set
the expectation, and they set it
high: national championship or
bust. And bust wasn't an option.
The Wolverines dominated
out of the gate and never looked
back. They swam to a three-peat
Big Ten championship, and they
handily captured the program's
12th national championship on
March 30.
Coach of the Year: John Beilein,
men's basketball
John Beilein finally made it.
Michigan's 60-year-old head
coach made stops at Eric Commu-
nity College, Nazareth, Le Moyne,
Canisius, Richmond, West Vir-
ginia and finally Michigan before
he made his Final Four.
And the wait couldn't have
been more worthwhile.
Balancing a team consisting
primarily of a hotshot freshman
class, dubbed the Fresh Five, a
star sophomore, Burke, and a

4

junior, Tim Hardaway Jr., Beilein
rewrote his traditional offense
and playing style to turn Michi-
gan into one of the quickest and
most exciting transition teams in
the nation.
Despite missing out on a Big
Ten title and a national title,
Beilein has established Ann Arbor
as a destination for big-time tal-
ent, and that stream of talent
won't slow anytime soon. The
expectations are higher now, and
that's just fine with Beilein.
Female Athlete of the Year:
Katie Zurales and Joanna Sampson,
women's gymnastics
It's hard to mention one with-
out the other. So I'll give you both.
Last month, senior Katie Zura-
les was named an AAI Award
finalist, following in the footsteps
of former captain Kylee Botter-
man, who won the award last fall.
Zurales and junior Joanna
Sampson have captained the Wol-
verines to one of the best seasons
in recent memory.
Sampson was named Big Ten
Gymnast of the Year and NCAA
Northeast Region Gymnast of the
Year. A Big Ten vault champion
and three-time NCAA vault and
all-around champion, Zurales was
named to the All-Big Ten Cham-
pionships team earlier this month.
Both were named to the All-Big
Ten first;team this season and
have combined for six Big Ten
Gymnast of the Week awards.
The Wolverines, undoubt-
edly the most consistent varsity
program on campus, have cap-
tured 18 Big Ten titles in the last
21 years. They begin the NCAA
Championships on Friday in Los

Angeles.
Male Athlete of the Year: Trey
Burke, men's basketball
The Daily diehards out there
might gripe that Burke won this
category lastyear and that there
should be a greater award to offer
the man who won every individ-
ual award the college basketball
world could think of.
Point taken.
Burke announced Sundaythat
he will forgo his junior and senior
seasons to enter the NBA Draft.
That decision was completely
expected, and even came a year
later than most anticipated.
But Burke stayed. He returned
for a sophomore season, and he
did the most with it, flirting with
records and milestones every step
of the way. Burke and his hero-
ics led Michigan to the national
championship game, and swept
the postseason awards before he
finally made the obvious decision
to leave early for the NBA.
For two years, he flashed great-
ness. He became the best player
in America, and, one day, his No.
3 should be raised to the rafters
at Crisler Center to leave him
amongthe Wolverine greats, the
ones who put Michigan firmly on
the map.
Career Achievement Award:
Denard Robinson, football
For three years, Denard Rob-
inson was the image of Michigan
athletics.
The quarterback took center
stage after gaining an NCAA-
record 502 yards against Notre
Dame as a sophomore. He says
nobody knew who he was before

that day. And then he was an
overnight celebrity, stopped on
sidewalks and in classrooms to
pose for a quick photo.
Robinson, more than any single
player, resurrected the Michigan
football team. Rich Rodriguez got
the boot and when Brady Hoke
ushered in a new era, he had Rob-
inson to ease the transition.
Robinson made 37 starts at
quarterback, ultimately setting
the NCAA record for career rush-
ing yards by a quarterback (4,495
yards), the NCAA single-season
record for rushing yards by a
quarterback (1,702), and became
the first player in NCAA history
to pass for 2,500 yards and rush
for 1,500 yards in a single season.
He broke myriad Big Ten and
Michigan program records, but
his mark remains because of the
team's success with Robinson .
at the helm - no matter at what
position. As a junior, in Hoke's
first season, Robinson led the
Wolverines to a BCS bowlvictory,
a 25-22 win over Virginia Tech in
the Sugar Bowl.
An ulnar-nerve injury sidelined
Robinson for a significant por-
tion of the back half of his senior
season, but he returned asa run-
ning back and wide receiver to
play in the final three games of his
career.
The program is certainly head-
ed in the right direction under
Hoke, but watching Michigan
simply won't be the same without
No.16, his shoelaces, his dread-
locks and hisbrilliant speed.

PLAYMAKERS
From Page 1B
Gallon was targeted more than
any other receiver in the situ-
ational scrimmage, and he caught
three passes for 22 yards, unoffi-
cially.
on the other side of the ball,
Clark spent much of the day lined
up against All-American fifth-
year senior tackle Taylor Lewan.
Clark has spent much of the
spring sparring with Lewan in
practice.

On Saturday, he was asked,
again, who typically wins the
battle.
"I've gotten that question so
many times," Clark said with
a smile before saying that the
matchup has been even.
If Gallon, as Gardner said, plays
sneakily big, then Clark plays
sneaky fast. Clark played safety in
high school but added 50 pounds
during his time at Michigan.
Now 274 pounds, Clark hasn't
lost his speed, according to Dileo.
"When you have a D-end who's
probably as fast as some of your

receivers, that classifies you as a
freak," Dileo said. "Just a mon-
ster."
Last year, Clark showed flashes
of athleticism but struggled with
consistency. He also was sus-
pended for Michigan's first game
before pleading guilty to a felony
count of second-degree home
invasion. He was arrested on June
14 for attempting to steal a laptop
from Stockwell Hall.
This year, Clark said he has
looked to seniors like Gardner to
become a better leader. He has
also tried to add consistency to his

playmaking ability.
"I wanted to be that player
who coach Mattison can rely on,"
Clark said. "With one of our key
players, Jake Ryan going down,
I know he's looking for that next
player to step into that new role
and be that player for him, and
that's what I want to be. I want .
to be that player he can look and
goI know Frank's going to make
a play."'
Lewan neutralized Clark for
much of Saturday. But later in the
practice, Clark moved to the right
side of Michigan's line.

"They didn't shoot as well this
time," Colton said. "I also think
we had a couple of goals that we

Anderson cited saves and field
blocks as two areas in which
Michigan failed to keep pace with
Indiana. The statistics backed
Anderson's assessment, as senior
goalkeeper Alex Adamson man-
aged only five stops on the day,
well short of the 11 recorded by
the Hoosiers' Jessica Gaudreault.
Michigan was forced to
rebound quickly after the loss,

Indiana knocked them out of con-

"After the Indiana game, we
talked about how, forthe moment,
we need to forget about the loss,"

Colton said. "We really tried to
focus on defense."
That defense ended up being
somewhat unnecessary. The Wol-
verines jumped out of the gate
quickly, racking up seven scores
in the first quarter against the
Falcons.
Freshman attacker Kelly Mar-
tin led the charge for Michigan,
recording her first career hat trick
with four goals in the game.
"She used her aggressiveness
on defense," Anderson said. "She
countered very well."
Michigan woke up early Sun-
day for the third-place match but
showed no signs of drowsiness.
Freshman two-meter Barbara
Lanier led the Wolverines with
a hat trick, and freshman two-
meter Bryce Beckwith and junior
attacker Hathaway Moore added

two scores apiece.
As a result of its third-place
finish, Michigan has to settle for
not entering the CWPA Eastern
Championship tournament as a
top seed, making a second-round
rematch with Indiana likely.
"The other two games we
played this weekend were an
afterthought," Anderson said.
"Our focus was purely to beat our
rival."
The Wolverines would love
a second chance against Indi-
ana, and they seem likely to get
it. A first-round victory in the
Eastern Division Championship
tournament would, in most sce-
narios, lead to a rematch with
the Hoosiers. Only the April 26
tournament opener at Canham
Natatorium stands in Michigan's
way.

- was all but certain.
On Sunday, he confirmed that,
announcing he plansto enter the
upcoming NBA Draft.
"It's always been a dream for
me to play in the NBA," Burke
said. "I think it was just the right
time for me.
"Now that it's here, I'm defi-
nitely fortunate and blessed. ... I
just feel like it was the best deci-
sion for me."
The future of three more start-
ers - Tim Hardaway Jr., Glenn
Robinson III and Mitch McGary
- currently hang in the balance.
If all three return, the Wolver-
ines will unquestionably be a pre-
season top-15 team. If all, or even
any, of them go, itcould thrust
next year's team into uncertainty.

seasoned Fab Five squad made

for underdog North Carolina.
Minutes after the game, Rose
told then-Michigan coach Steve
Fisher that, "We'll be back." Web-
ber even told fans at a Crisler
Arena pep rally the next day that
he'd return for his junior year.
But many around him already
knew that the most recognizable

didn't play high-school football
(he did, however, play a year
in the Israeli Football League
before coming to Ann Arbor).
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
said after the game that Cleary
has settled into the backup role
behind Gardner but also didn't
diminish the play of Swieca.
"It was good to give them
snaps with people here, with
people in this stadium and play-
ing in this stadium," Hoke said.
"I think both of them handled
themselves well."
On Saturday, Cleary looked
the part of the backup. He
played fine, not wowing any-
one with his passes but also not
looking completely unprepared.
The redshirt freshman com-
pleted two of his nine passes for
24 yards and one touchdown.
His biggest play of the game
might have come on a run, when
he scrambled away from the
rush for a 21-yard gain.
Swieca also had a couple of
good throws - finishing 4-of-
7 for 36 yards - but at times
looked a little rattled against

history was to be no more.
"You want to leave as a cham-
pion but also you don't want to go
through it again," Webber said a
week later.
Nearly a month after the time-
out, on May 5,1993, Webber's
time as a Wolverines formally
came to end with a decision he
called "necessary."
"There's no concrete reason
why I should stay," he said in his
statement.
A year later, after third-seeded
Michigan was upended by even-
tual-champion Arkansas in the
regional final, Rose and Juwan
Howard left. It would be the final
Sweet 16 for the program until
this year, 19 seasons later.
"Everybody figured the story
of the Fab Five was over," said
former Detroit News sports writ-
er Bryan Burwell in "Fab Five."
Obviously, it wasn't.
A year and a half later, as the
Ed Martin scandal began rearing
its ugly head, Fisher was fired.
At a press conference on Oct. 12,
1997 announcing his departure,
Fisher said he had "tremendous
pride" in his legacy.
"We have taken a basketball
program and built it into one of
the elite programs in the country
the right way," he said, then for
added emphasis, repeated once
more, "the rightway."
It had been four years since the
timeout, four years since Webber
left Ann Arbor, but unbeknownst
to any at the time, it was closer
to the start, not the end, of the
legacy Webber had left on the
the Michigan rush, understand-
able for someone who gets sig-
nificantly less snaps in practice
than Gardner.
It might be one of the only
times in his career that Swieca
sees the field at Michigan Stadi-
um, or it might be a good primer
if he somehow vaults into the
backup role.
But for the defensive players
who don't often see the offen-
sive backups, it was a good
experience just to see someone
like Swieca - whose skill is an
unproven commodity - get a
chance.
"Everyone is involved, every-
one is playing, so you get to see
a lot of guys' skills that maybe
you don't see as much in the
fall," said junior linebacker
Desmond Morgan. "It's cool to
see everyone out there playing
and seeing what everyone really
has."
Still, on Saturday, it was clear
who was the alpha quarterback.
Both Cleary and Swieca were
hit to the ground on a couple of
plays, even though they were
wearing orange jerseys that sig-
nified contact was to be avoided.
Gardner, the other Wolverine
quarterback wearing orange,
wasn't touched.

RUSH
From Page 1B
Turns out no one sent that
message to freshman defensive
end Taco Charlton.
When Swieca took the field for
a few snaps on Saturday, he was
met by Charlton's 6-foot-6, 265-
pound frame barreling toward
him. Charlton, apparently, took
no notice of the orange jersey, as
he sacked the quarterback not
once, but twice.
"Freshmen," said Michigan
coach Brady Hoke, shaking his
head, when asked about Charl-
ton's tackles after the game.
And though he might have
been disappointed about Charl-
ton's overeagerness during what
was supposed to be just a light
scrimmage, Hoke has some opti-
mism about the future of the pass
rush.
"I think we've got some young
kids who have some ability," Hoke
said. "I think with (defensive
coordinator) Greg (Mattison) and
his passion and how he teaches
it, rushing the passer, I think the
work that's being put in ... and the
guys are excited about it."
Mattison said on April 4 that he
wanted the pass rush to become a

trademark of Michigan's defense,
and though there's still a long
way to go until the season starts,
everyone from Hoke to the defen-
sive line seemed pleased with the
progression of the pass rush.
Fifth-year senior defensive
tackle Quinton Washington said
in the past, pass rushes relied
more on blitzes and were more
"team-ran" than anything else.
But the Wolverines are trying to
get away from that mentality.
"This year it's one-on-one,
it's a mental thing," Washington
said. "The four people in front
have to get home every time."
Washington, redshirt junior
tackle Jibreel Black, redshirt
sophomore defensive end Keith
Heitzman and junior defensive
end Frank Clark composed the
starting four of Saturday's defen-
sive line.
Sacks on Swieca aside, the
defensive line held relatively
steady on Saturday, or at least as
much as can be expected for a
scrimmage. The transition of the
Wolverines' offense to rely more
on the air game has given the
defensive line increased oppor-
tunities to practice the pass rush.
So, who does the defensive line
have to thank for this confidence?
The offensive line and fifth-year

senior tackle Taylor Lewan, in
particular. Clark joked that he
looks at Lewan as a player from
Ohio State to motivate himself
during practice.
But if imagining his teammate
as an enemy is what it takes for
the defensive line to improve its
pass rush and serve as an exam-
ple to younger players, like Charl-
ton, Clark will take it.
"If (Lewan) wouldn't have
stayed, I don't know who I would
be battling every day, what type
of competition I'd be going after,"
Clark said. "Who can make me
better as a pass rusher and as a
player?"

Michigan outscores Spartans
by 29 runs in weekend romp

In five innings, a
21-run explosion

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Exactly one month after the
Michigan softball team's last loss,
it looked as though its dominance
would finally come to an end in
East Lansing on Sunday.
Down 7-4 against Michi-
gan State in the seventh inning,
junior catcher Caitlin Blanchard
doubled to center field to spark a
rally that would end in a Michi-
gan sweep and the team's 17th
straight victory.
Senior second baseman Ashley
Lane followed Blanchard with
a home run to put the Wolver-
ines within one run. Freshman

was tied at seven, and it was time
for extra innings.
Michigan (12-0 Big Ten, 35-7
overall) wasted no time in the
extra frame. After junior right
fielder Nicole Sappingfield
reached on a fielder's choice and
freshman shortstop Sierra Rome-
ro was intentionally walked,
Blanchard came through again
with an RBI single to knock in
the would-be winning run. In
the bottom of the eighth inning,
sophomore right-hander Sara
Driesenga set the Spartans down
in order to clinch the victory.
"The important thing about
this team is that, no matter how
many runs we're up or down, we
just keep fighting and we just
keep persevering," Blanchard
said. "Our offense is what really
does that for us, and when we can
score a lot of runsthat really helps
the defense and the pitching."
The game was the second half
of a doubleheader played on Sun-
day, after agame originally sched-
uled for Saturday was postponed
due to weather. The split series

between the interstate rivals
started in Ann Arbor on Friday
night before moving to East Lan-
sing for the final two games.
Michigan State (7-4, 21-17)
came into the weekend in sec-
ond place in the Big Ten, and for
a moment on Friday afternoon, it
looked as though the 12th-ranked
Wolverines might have found
their first competition since
entering Big Ten play. Michigan
gave up a run to the Spartans in
the first inning but failed to score
in its own half of the first - a rar-
ity for a team that has dominated
in early innings this year.
Then after evening the score
at one, Romero stepped up to the
plate with the bases loaded in the
bottom ofthe second and did what
she has done all year - crush the
ball. On a 2-0 pitch, Romero sent
the next pitch over the left-field
wall to put Michigan up 5-1. The
team never looked back, putting
on an offensive clinic en route to
a 21-2 run-rule victory.
Senior third baseman Amy
Knapp kept it going with an RBI
single - her second hit of the

inning. The Wolverine offense
continued into the third inning
in which it scored 13 runs. Soph-
omore Lauren Sweet, junior
Lyndsay Doyle, freshman Kelsey
Susalla and junior Taylor Hassel-
bach all chipped in with long balls
in the inning - the most home
runs Michigan has had this sea-
son in a single frame. The Wolver-
ines added two more runs in the
fourth before the mercy rule was
put into effect.
In the circle, sophomore left-
hander Haylie Wagner regained
composure after struggling in
the first inning. She pitched four
innings while striking out five
Spartans.
"I just wanted us to settle in
and play our game, and we did
obviously," said Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins. "We were defi-
nitely on all cylinders on offense,
and you don't expect that to be
the norm, but it's certainly excit-
ing. ... The one thing I like about
this team, nothing fazes them.
This team just does their part."
On Sunday, during the first
game of the doubleheader,

Michigan's offense started qui-
etly before producing a big fifth
inning. The Wolverines got on
the board first when Sappingfield
scored on an error in the first
inning, but Michigan State got
the run back quickly off starting
pitcher Driesenga.
Pitching dominated through
the middle innings, with each
side only allowing one additional
run until Michigan came to bat
in the fifth. Michigan scored
two runs by stringing together a
series of hits before finally load-
ing the bases for Romero. The
Spartans had already intention-
ally walked Romero three times
in the game, but now had no place
to put her - and she made them
pay. The freshman sent a shot to
left field - her second grand slam
of the series - to put Michigan
up 8-2. The Wolverines tagged on
three more in the sixth inning to
give them the 11-2 victory.
"We have so much depth in
this lineup," Lane said. "Anyone
can do it at any given time. It's
exciting. This team is very spe-
cial."

pitch. The con-
ference-leading and 12th-ranked
Wolverines (12-0, 35-7) threat-
ened in the bottom half of the
frame, putting runners on second
and third with only one out, but
they failedto bring a runner home.
But when freshman phenom
Sierra Romero - who boasts a.416
batting average and 15 home runs
on the season - stepped up to the
plate, the winds showed signs of
change. The two flags in center-
field started fluttering in the brisk
breeze.
From the crack of the bat, the
crowd knew it was gone and that
the shortstop would trot around
all four bases and into a mob of
teammates at home plate. Rome-
ro smashed a bomb to deep left
center, with a little help from the
wind. Michigan State's left fielder
Alyssa McBride had no chance.
She just turned to watch the ball

blowing out
and you have to adjust your game.
The key is that we're swinging
well and seeing the ball. You can't
always control everything else."
The Wolverines scored 13 runs
in the third inning, and they still
weren't done.
Michigan finished the contest
by setting the mark for runs tal-
lied against the Spartans, scoring
20 runs for the first time since
2000. The last of the six home
runs meant the most to Hutchins,
as junior Katie Luetkens rounded
the bases with a fist pump and a
smile after lining a two-run pinch-
hit drive over the fence - just her
second career hit.
"It was a great feeling, a lot of
emotion," Luetkens said. "Lots
of people want that moment, and
I got the opportunity to have it.
That's something I can cherish
forever."

With sweep of Penn State, Blue
tied for first place in the Big Ten

By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Writer
After the final out was recorded
in its weekend series against Penn
State, the Michigan baseball team
waited for Michigan coach Erik
Bakich in left field to address it as
he does after every game. Normal-
ly, Bakich is met by a team quietly
awaiting his
words. This PENN STATE 1

After going five years with-
out a Big Ten series sweep before
sweeping Michigan State last
weekend, Michigan (7-2 Big Ten,
20-14 overall) repeated the feat, as
it handled Penn State in three con-
secutive games, 5-1, 3-2 and 8-1.
With the sweep, the team has won
nine games in a row.
"Even though we hadn't (swept
a series) before, once we got a taste
of it we knew that we could come
out and do it again," said senior
centerfielder Patrick Biondi.
Against the Nittany Lions
(0-9, 7-24), the Wolverine bullpen
played a pivotal role, entering all
three games when the outcome
was in doubt. The relief pitchers
combined to pitch14 innings in the
series while allowing no runs and
six hits. Sophomore right-hander
Matt Ogden led the way, pitching
7.1 innings in his two appearances
and being credited with the win
each time.
"With this hot streak we're on
right now, we're doing our job, and
we trust our coach with pitches,"
Ogden said. "Everyone is trying to
get theirs a little bit and help this
team out."
