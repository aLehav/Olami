ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

VP of Student Life Martino Harmon talks housing investigation, activism
In an exclusive two-part installment, The Daily sits down with campus leader to discuss RHA demands, virtual fraternity and sorority rush 

The Michigan Daily sat down with 

Martino Harmon, vice president of 
student life, to discuss supporting 
MHousing 
and 
MDining, 
RHA 

experiences and the impact of student 
activism. This interview has been edited 
and condensed for clarity. 

Residence 
Halls 
Association 

(RHA)

TMD: In light of the recent 

Daily investigation into University 
Housing and the experience of RHA 
student workers, does Student Life 
plan to make any changes to the 
structure of University Housing? 

MH: I don’t know that I have 

any particular structural changes 
that I can share at this time. But 
at the same time, I was personally 
very concerned at the reports that 
I heard and we’ve been in a number 
of discussions about what we need 
to do moving forward to improve 
the culture, improve the support, 
training, communication — making 
sure that staff understand their roles 
and what they can do — and how to 
best guide and support students. 
We want to make sure that students 
feel safe, that they feel valued, that 
they know that the support is there 
— that’s critically important. The 
recent situation just amplifies the 
importance of that even more.

TMD: How does Student Life 

plan to work with ResStaff to 
rebuild trust and protect Resident 
Advisors in the coming semesters?

MH: I know that Michigan 

Housing staff have been taking 
a careful examination of their 
training to see how they continue 
to work with campus partners. I 

think one of the things that we 
need to do is make sure when we’re 
talking with staff about how they 
support students, that we also make 
sure they know how Student Life 
supports staff. Our goal is to make 
sure that the staff are very aware 
of the cultural conditions, and we 
are doing all we can to enhance and 
improve the culture so everyone feels 
safe and valued.

TMD: Why are ResStaff encouraged 

to 
report 
allegations 
of 
sexual 

misconduct to Hall Directors instead of 
to the Equity, Civil Rights & Title IX 
Office directly like other mandatory 
reporting policies on campus?

MH: Let me clarify, that any 

ResStaff 
member 
can 
report 

anywhere. We don’t prevent a student 
from reporting to ECRT for any type 
of incident. It’s my understanding that 
the role of Housing staff is to support 
students. We want them to know 
that they should definitely report to 
Housing staff and not to think that 
they can’t, but we don’t prevent them 
from working with ECRT directly as 
well. It’s my understanding that both 
options are available.

TMD: Does Student Life have 

any plans to increase support for the 
mental health of Student Life workers, 
particularly Resident Advisors?

MH: We want to make sure 

ResStaff knows that we’re also 
supporting 
them, 
not 
just 
the 

residents they serve. We also have 
to make sure that training for our 
campus partners — whether it’s a 
SAPAC (Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center) or CAPS 
(Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services) — is reflective of the 
needs of ResStaff and our students. 

We are linking this to broader 

efforts to expand and enhance 
how we address mental health on 
campus for all students. We’ve 
focused this year on a more 
holistic, 
institutional 
approach 

to 
addressing 
mental 
health. 

Whether it’s Wolverine Wellness, 
UHS (University Health Services), 
peer support, resource navigators 
or helping faculty to understand 
the signs of mental health distress 
and knowing how to refer students, 
we want to be effective in reaching 
students — particularly those we 
don’t believe are connected through 
support 
programs 
and 
those 

underrepresented or marginalized. 
We’re really looking at a number of 
different ways and want to make sure 
the ResStaff members are part of that.
Student organization engagement

TMD: From your perspective, 

how did the 2022 Maize Days go — 
in terms of fundraising and student 
engagement overall — now that 
students are back in-person?

MH: I don’t have the exact 

numbers, but as I understand it, 
the number of organizations that 
were involved increased. We would 
anticipate that as the campus opens 
up, more students are more engaged 
and more involved. That’s a good sign. 
We also expect that generosity follows 
that trend as well. We’re still waiting 
on the final data, but it’s exciting to 
see us moving back to where we 
were with those initiatives. And 
that success helps our programs 
that support students. Whether it’s 
the Maize & Blue Cupboard or other 
programs, those donations help to 
fill student needs.

TMD: With the Fraterinity and 

Sorority Life rush cycle having 
to pivot to a mostly online format 
— with the exception of bid day — 
and different fraternities rushing 
in a variety of formats, how did 
this year’s rush go from your 
perspective?

MH: Early reports indicate that 

it went well. I think Fraternity and 
Sorority Life utilized the hybrid 
format as best as they could to try to 
keep the community safe. From what 
I’ve learned, the IFC (Interfraternity 
Council) had a pretty good increase 
of prospective new members, the 
Panhellenic Association held steady 
— it increased from 2020 and held 
fairly steady with 2021. 

The MGC (Multicultural Greek 

Council) and NPHC (National Pan-
Hellenic Council) are really in a 
rebuilding, growth and planning 
phase. They tend to be smaller 
organizations 
so 
they’re 
really 

trying to understand how they can 
grow coming out of the pandemic.

University 
of 

Michigan 
community 

members 
gathered 
at 

the 
Michigan 
Union 

Tuesday 
to 
celebrate 

the 50th anniversary of 
multicultural 
lounges 

in University residence 
halls. Current students, 
alumni and legacy groups 
were in attendance for the 
event, which featured the 
commemoration of a time 
capsule scheduled to be 
opened in 25 years. The 
event also featured several 
speakers 
and 
musical 

performances from the 
Women’s Glee Club.

Multicultural spaces in 

residence halls serve to 

commemorate 
activists 

from 
underrepresented 

communities. 
These 

lounges 
were 
created 

following 
increased 

activism from the Black 
Action Movement — a 
coalition of Black student 
organizations 
in 
the 

1970s that fought against 
injustices and advocated 
for Black student rights. 
These spaces were formed 
in hopes of supporting 
students of Color.

The first lounge, the 

Abeng Lounge in East 
Quad, 
was 
established 

in 1971. Since then, the 
program has expanded to 
encompass 16 lounges across 
the 
University’s 
dorms. 

Martha 
Cook, 
Betsey 

Barbour and Henderson 
House do not currently 

have multicultural lounges. 

Speakers at the event 

honored many contributors 
to the original lounges. One 
of the speakers was Lee Gill, 
a former U-M student and 
the current special assistant 
to the president and chief 
diversity officer at Clemson 
University. Gill explained 
that the importance of 
this event was not just to 
remember the history, but 
to keep educating students 
on that history.

“We 
need 
to 
keep 

beating the drum,” Gill said. 
“Let’s continue to build 
an inclusive institution of 
higher education … these 
great 
institutions, 
they 

have stories that we need 
to share with incoming 
students.”

The celebration of 50 

years 
of 
these 
spaces 

comes at a time when 
conversations about safe 
spaces 
on 
campus 
for 

underrepresented 
groups 

have been deepened by a 
recent letter to the Board 
of Regents entitled “White 
Students 
Colonizing 

Trotter.” 

The 
letter 
advised 

administrators 
to 
work 

on preserving safe spaces 
for 
students 
of 
Color, 

specifically 
the 
Trotter 

Multicultural 
Center, 

which was founded in 
1972. While smaller in size 
than Trotter, multicultural 
lounges have also acted as 
safe spaces for students of 
Color.

COVID-19 cases 

trend upward 

again after 

weeks of decline 

at UMich, 
looser mask 
requirements

 Most positive tests linked to 

unmasked social gatherings, free 
at-home antigen tests available

With 
one 
month 

of the Winter 2022 
semester 
remaining, 

COVID-19 cases at the 
University of Michigan 
are trending upward 
again 
after 
weeks 

of 
declining 
cases, 

according to a Friday 
email 
from 
Robert 

Ernst, 
associate 
vice 

president of student life 
and director of campus 
COVID-19 
response, 

and Chief Health Officer 
Preeti Malani.

Ernst and Malani 

wrote that most of 
these cases are likely 
linked 
to 
unmasked 

social 
gatherings 
on 

campus and suggested 
steps U-M community 
members can take to 
address rising COVID-
19 case counts in an 
email to the campus 
community.

According 
to 
the 

University of Michigan’s 
Campus 
Maize 
and 

Blueprint, the University 
saw a rise in weekly 
cases since March 5, 
with the largest rise in 
weekly cases since Jan. 

8 — at least an additional 
72 cases — coming in 
the week ending on 
March 26. This increase 
mirrors the trend of 
COVID-19 
cases 
in 

Washtenaw 
County, 

where 
case 
counts 

increased by 32.9 cases 
per 100k residents from 
the 
week 
beginning 

with March 16 to the 
week beginning with 
March 23. 

“Many 
of 
these 

cases can be linked 
to 
unmasked 
social 

gatherings,” Ernst and 
Malani wrote. 

U-M 
students 

accounted for 26% of 
Washtenaw 
County’s 

cases in the week prior 
to March 30, according 
to 
the 
dashboard. 

The increase in case 
counts 
comes 
after 

the 
University 
lifted 

its mask mandate on 
March 14 for most 
indoor spaces, including 
offices, residence halls 
and at athletic events. 
Masks are still required 
in classrooms, patient 
care 
areas, 
campus 

buses and COVID-19 
testing sites.

 Pilar’s 

Foundation, hosts 
first fundraiser 

in support of 
Washtenaw 

Afghan refugees

 Family-owned tamale shop raises 

money to provide services to 

county immigrants

Pilar’s 
Foundation 

hosted 
a 
fundraiser 

at the Zion Lutheran 
Church 
Sunday 
to 

support the resettlement 
of Afghan refugees in 
Washtenaw 
County. 

Pilar’s 
Foundation, 

the nonprofit arm of 
Pilar’s 
Tamales 
that 

partners 
with 
local 

and 
international 

organizations 
to 

provide vital services 
to 
immigrants 
and 

refugees 
in 
the 

Washtenaw 
County 

area, collaborated with 
Jewish Family Services 
(JFS) on the fundraising 
event. 

The fundraiser was 

Pilar’s Foundation’s first 
“official” 
fundraiser 

since 
acquiring 
tax-

exempt 501(c)3 status. 
Although the new status 
allows them to expand 
their 
fundraising 

efforts, the foundation 
has 
been 
operating 

for over 20 years and 
has been committed 
to “working locally to 
make the world a better 
place,” 
according 
to 

their website. 

Attendees could order 

meals 
that 
included 

either two, six or 12 
tamales, 
accompanied 

by curtido (cabbage slaw 
with 
onions, 
carrots, 

oregano and apple cider 
vinegar), casamiento (a 
mix of black beans and 
white basmati rice) and 
Pilar’s 
tamale 
sauce. 

The restaurant donated 
all the proceeds to the 
foundation’s charitable 
efforts. 

In order to adapt to 

the ongoing COVID-19 
pandemic, 
customers 

were 
able 
to 
place 

orders in advance, and 
they 
were 
available 

for curbside pick-up, if 
preferred or walk in. 

Sylvia 
Nolasco-

Rivers, owner of the 
restaurant and president 
of the foundation, said 
Pilar’s has been giving 
back to the community 
for the past two decades. 

“Every event that we 

have done continues to 
help us to do our work 
better,” Nolasco-Rivers 
said. “The work that 
we’ve been doing for the 
past 20 years has been 
really a labor of love.”

Multiple 100-gallon bins filled with unused, expired medication to be disposed responsibly

The University of Michigan 

College of Pharmacy hosted a 

Safe Medication Disposal event 

on Tuesday, which collected and 

disposed of unused or expired 

medications in an environmentally 

friendly 
way 
to 
protect 
the 

ecosystem. This event was led 

by two student organizations 

within the College of Pharmacy: 

American 
Pharmacists 

Association – Academy of Student 

Pharmacists and Phi Delta Chi, a 

professional pharmacy fraternity 

founded in Ann Arbor.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 

the event was put on pause in 

the 2020-2021 school year. Last 

semester’s event collected 541 

bottles of medication. Drop-off 

sites were located on Ingalls Mall 

and inside the University Hospital 

complex People could either drive 

or walk up to the organizers 

to drop off their medications. 

Volunteers sorted the medications 

into different categories such as 

capsules, tablets and controlled 

substances before sending them 

off to disposal. 

Just two hours into the event, 

several 
100-gallon 
bins 
were 

already filled with medications 

and volunteers from the College 

of Pharmacy worked together to 

efficiently sort and dispose of 

the waste. Pharmacy student 

Brendan Veit was among the 

student volunteers at the Ingalls 

Mall location. He said the goal of 

this event was to educate people 

on the importance of proper 

medical disposal.

“Some 
people 
don’t 

understand how much of an 

impact it has on the ecosystem 

when medications are thrown 

away or flushed down the toilet,” 

Veit said. “Taking medications 

out of landfills and disposing of 

them properly makes it so that 

there’s no real chance of anyone 

misusing the medication.”

The 
University 
follows 
the 

Environmental 
Protection 

Agency’s suggestion of incinerating 

collected medicine by sending 

the collected medications to Drug 

& Laboratory, Inc. Drugs that 

cannot be incinerated are sent to 

chemically-secure landfills.

The 
Food 
and 
Drug 

Administration 
offers 
a 
list 

of medications that are safe 

to flush and provides various 

ways to dispose of other types 

of medication safely at home to 

prevent 
controlled 
substance 

abuse and the contamination 

of local waterways. The Safe 

Medication Disposal event aimed 

to reduce the harmful effects of 

improper disposal of medication. 

Nancy Mason, who retired as 

dean at the College of Pharmacy 

in 2020 and is now an emerita 

clinical professor of pharmacy, 

created the safe disposal project 

with other faculty members in 

2014. She said the best way to 

combat medicine ending up in 

landfills and water supplies.

“These 
kinds 
of 
events 

are the best way to dispose 

of medications because they 

all get incinerated and don’t 

get into landfills and water 

supplies,” Mason said. “Getting 

medications out of the house 

when they are no longer useful 

is 
important 
for 
controlled 

substance 
diversion 
and 

(reducing) poisonings.”

Emily Nguyen is a second year 

PharmD candidate and one of 

the organizers of the event. She 

discussed the importance of safe 

medication disposal to protect 

the environment. 

“Certain 
medication, 
when 

you dispose of it incorrectly, can 

get into the water,” Nguyen said. 

“It is a bit more difficult to clean 

the water, and that is the main 

reason why we want to dispose of 

it in a proper way.”

 Iraqi Student Association invites 

UMich campus community to a night of 

Chai & Chobi

RONI KANE

Daily News Editor

 Over 100 attendees gather at Rackham in celebration of dance, food and culture

Light from the chandeliers 

in the Rackham Assembly Hall 

reflected 
off 
the 
bejeweled 

djellaba 
dresses 
worn 
by 

members of the Iraqi Student 

Association 
(ISA) 
as 
they 

hosted their third annual Chai 

& Chobi: Iraqi Culture Night on 

Wednesday. Over 100 members 

of the campus community came 

together at the event to explore 

Iraqi culture through food, dance 

and education.

After members of ISA greeted 

attendees 
in 
English, 
Farsi, 

Chaldean, Hebrew, Turkish and 

Kurdish — which are some of the 

languages 
spoken 
throughout 

Iraq — Public Health senior 

Marwa Khalil, ISA president, 

highlighted 
the 
importance 

of gathering to celebrate the 

diversity of the country. Khalil 

said 
the 
media 
sometimes 

overshadows the beauty of Iraqi 

culture with political conflict in 

the region.

“Tonight’s goal is to highlight 

the beauty of Iraq that so many 

current narratives do not share,” 

Khalil said. “Iraq is so often seen 

as only a war zone … but it’s so 

much more than that, and that’s 

what we want to showcase.”

Two 
years 
ago, 
ISA 
held 

the first Chai & Chobi night in 

the 
Rackham 
Assembly 
Hall 

with a Small Grant from the 

Barger 
Leadership 
Institute 

(BLI) — a student and faculty-

run organization within LSA 

that awards funding to student 

projects that will benefit the 

campus community. 

LSA 
senior 
Diana 
Ramo, 

ISA treasurer, was in charge of 

fundraising for the event and 

purchasing the costumes, food 

and supplies. According to Ramo, 

BLI is no longer involved with 

the event, so she and other ISA 

members worked to find other 

sources of funding. After having 

attended the in-person event in 

2020, Ramo told The Michigan 

Daily it was fulfilling to bring 

everything full circle and treat 

the campus community to Chai & 

Chobi once again.

“I loved (Chai & Chobi) as an 

attendee and so getting to be 

involved with the planning and 

the dance (performance) and 

everything was a really rewarding 

experience,” Ramo said.

 — pronounced “shay” and 

often transliterated to “chai” in 

English — is the Arabic word for 

tea. In Iraq, chai is often served 

at events and is one of the most 

important 
hot 
beverages 
in 

Iraqi culture. To commemorate 

this 
tradition, 
attendees 
had 

the opportunity to drink Iraqi 

chai while enjoying handmade 

baklava, hummus and other Iraqi 

foods and pastries.

Business 
junior 
Daniella 

Sultani said she came to the event 

with friends to immerse herself 

in the sights, sounds and flavors 

of Iraqi culture.

“We wanted to try the delicious 

chai,” Sultani said. “Trying the 

Iraqi sweets has been super fun 

and … so has seeing all of the 

culture and outfits and music 

come together.”

Sultani and LSA senior Hamsa 

Ezzi are also both members of 

the Arabesque Dance Troupe, 

a 
campus 
organization 
that 

has done collaborative dance 

performances with ISA and other 

cultural organizations in the 

past. Though she was familiar 

with some of the traditional Iraqi 

dances from her experience with 

Arabesque, Ezzi said watching 

ISA members dance at the event 

was an enjoyable way to spend 

the evening.

“This is my first time attending 

a Chai & Chobi,” Ezzi said. “The 

performances have been really 

exciting.”

According to Ramo, “Chobi” is 

the national dance of Iraq and is 

often performed at public events 

in the country. It is performed 

by either a line or a circle of 

dancers who hold hands while 

kicking their legs in unison. At 

Wednesday’s event, ISA members 

performed the Chobi dance to a 

medley of Iraqi music.

During 
the 
performance, 

attendees began clapping to the 

beat of the music, rhythmically 

uniting the crowd with the 

dancers. The ISA performers 

then invited the attendees to 

join hands with them on the 

dance floor and learn the Chobi 

dance.

LSA freshman Noor Alchalabi 

was one of the performers. 

After attending Iraqi culture

ADMINISTRATION

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

U.S. President Joe Biden 

nominated 
Judge 
Ketanji 

Brown Jackson to the U.S. 
Supreme Court on Feb. 25. If 
confirmed, Jackson will be 
the first Black woman to sit on 
the nation’s highest court. The 
Michigan Daily sat down with 
University of Michigan experts 
and students to discuss the 
significance of Jackson’s nom-
ination and last week’s confir-
mation hearings.

Campus reaction to Jack-

son’s nomination

Law 
Students 
Nia 
Vogel 

and 
Dashaya Foreman are the 

managing editor and editor-
in-chief, respectively, of the 
Michigan Law Review and are 
the first pair of Black women 
to lead the law journal in its 
121-year history. They are also 
members of the Michigan Black 
Law Student Association. In an 
interview with the Daily, Fore-
man said she felt encouraged 

to see someone who shares 
her identity nominated to the 
Supreme Court.

“I’m taking a lot of pride in 

this moment,” Foreman said. 
“Now being in law school and 
seeing her be nominated, and 
hopefully (being) confirmed 
very shortly, (she is) very 
inspiring for me. I think it’s 
long overdue, but I definitely 
think it’s a step in the right 
direction for students of Color 
who are interested in being 
legal advocates.”

Jackson’s qualifications for 

the associate Supreme Court 
justice position –– which 
include a degree from Har-
vard Law, a federal courtship 
position and a history of public 
service, as well as her back-
ground having grown up in a 
major city and attended a pub-
lic high school — would make 
her a historic addition to the 
Court. Jackson also served as 
a federal public defender from 
2005-2007. During that time, 
she represented four Guantá-
namo Bay detainees following 
the landmark 2004 Supreme 
Court decision that detainees 
in the military prison could 

challenge their detentions in 
federal court. If confirmed, 
she would be the first former 
public defender to serve on the 
Supreme Court. Jackson would 
also join Justices Samuel A. 
Alito and Elena Kagan as the 
only Supreme Court justices to 
have graduated from a public 
high school.

Vogel reiterated Foreman’s 

excitement at the prospect 
of Jackson’s appointment. As 
someone who is an advocate 
for criminal justice reform, 
Vogel said she is inspired by 
Judge Jackson’s background in 
criminal defense.

“Symbolically, 
(Jackson’s 

nomination) definitely shows 
Black women … that they 
are accepted and can work 
towards their goals, no mat-
ter what the capacity is,” Vogel 
said. “It’s really great seeing 
someone coming from a crimi-
nal defense background on the 
Supreme Court … and 
bringing that per-
spec-
tive 
to 
the 

crimi-
nal jus-

tice cases that the court will 
see.”

Law professor Richard D. 

Friedman 
specializes 
in 

constitutional law and 
the U.S. Supreme Court 
at U-M Law School. 
Friedman has argued 
two 
cases 
before 

the 
Court, 
Bris-

coe 
v. 
Virginia 

(2004) and Ham-
mon v. Indiana 
(2006). Fried-
man 
spoke 

with 
The 

Daily 
about 

Jackson’s 
nomination 
and reflected 
on her four days 
of 
testimony 
in 

front of the Senate. 
Though Jackson’s 
work as a former 
public defender is 
admirable, 
Fried-

man said, it likely would not have 
much of an impact on her deci-

sions as a Supreme Court 

justice. 

“I wouldn’t 
overplay the 

signifi-

cance of 

(Jack-

son’s 

public defense background),” 
Friedman said. “When (judges) 
take on the judicial role, they 
realize that they’re no longer 
advocates — they’re judges. 
Her job on the Court will not 
be to be the defendant’s repre-
sentative on the Court, it’s to be 
a judge … I would guess that 
she’ll be somewhat readier 
than most of the other (jus-
tices) to recognize defen-
dants’ rights … But we’ll see 
over time.”

LSA junior Julia Schetten-
helm, 
communications 

director of the Univer-

sity’s chapter of College 

Democrats, wrote in 

an email to The Daily 

that the organiza-
tion supports Jack-
son’s nomination 
to the Supreme 
Court.

Overall, we’re pretty pleased 

with how the FSL rush went in 
terms of growth.

MHousing and MDining
The Michigan Daily: What led 

the University to decide to demolish 
the Northwood III apartments 
and build new living spaces for 
students?

Martino Harmon: The housing 

experience is a big part of the overall 
student 
experience. 
It’s 
really 

important that we create the best 
environment possible and certainly 
Northwood’s been around for a 
while. Planning (started) before 
the pandemic, and it was really 
time to — with Regent approval 
— introduce a 1,200-bed facility. I 
don’t know that it will be called the 
“Northwood Apartments,” but it’s a 
new facility that will provide more 
opportunities for engagement. So 

that was really the main reason for 
this, and I’m just thrilled that we’re 
able to move forward with that 
project.

TMD: Will the new residence 

buildings be apartment-style living 
or similar to the larger residence 
halls on campus such as South or 
West Quad Residence Halls?

MH: It’ll definitely be different 

than 
the 
current 
Northwood 

Apartments. 
It’ll 
be 
a 
large 

residence hall, but it will be a suite-
style arrangement. So it won’t be 
the standard double (dorm) rooms 
throughout, but it will be a lot of 
suites and a lot of lounges and study 
spaces.

TMD: 
What 
student 

demographics 
— 
such 
as 

undergraduate or graduate students 
— will the new residence hall 
primarily serve?

MH: 
We 
haven’t 
exactly 

spelled that out yet. Our typical 
philosophy — other than maybe 
(Munger Graduate Residences)— is 

that our facilities will be open to 
students that apply (for housing). 
Our priority is to house all new 
(first-year) 
students, 
and 
then 

whatever space we have left can 
go to sophomores, juniors, transfer 
students, maybe graduate students. 
Right now, we haven’t specified 
that this new facility is just for one 
particular group of candidates.

TMD: With the return to an 

in-person MDining experience this 
year for students, how has Student 
Life worked to ensure all residence 
and dining halls are adequately 
staffed, 
particularly 
after 
the 

University experienced campus-
wide staffing shortages?

MH: The dining experience, 

much 
like 
housing, 
is 
an 

engagement experience. It’s not 
just about eating. It’s about the 
opportunity for students to engage, 
to learn, to have a full experience. 
But we have been challenged by 
the labor shortages — just like 
restaurants in Ann Arbor and 

places all over the nation. Our goal 
has been to keep everything open, 
and we’ve accomplished that goal 
— we don’t want to close any dining 
facilities. 

We’ve also been able to make 

adjustments to make sure we have 
enough service: where we knew 
we couldn’t hire enough students, 
we made opportunities available 
for (University) staff who were 
not working in dining and wanted 
some additional work. We’re also 
focused on addressing labor issues. 
We were able to make a slight 
increase in the average wages by 
about $1 across the board, but we 
know that we need to do more to be 
competitive. The labor shortage is 
a real challenge, and that’s why it’s 
important for us to keep looking at 
ways to address that challenge.

TMD: 
 
Student 
activists 

and campus leaders have been 
discussing the possibility of a 
$15 minimum wage for student 
workers this semester. Does Student 

Life have any plans to explore a 
$15 minimum wage for student 
workers?

MH: I can only really speak 

for Student Life workers in areas 
like dining or in mail facilities 
and residence halls. We have been 
looking at how we can make our 
wages more competitive. We’re 
still doing an analysis of that and 
I’m optimistic that we’ll continue 
moving forward. I know the regents 
are also looking at competitive 
wages across campus.

TMD: As the Vice President of 

Student Life, you’re part of the U-M 
administration, but you also oversee 
the different student organizations 
and different voices on campus. 
So in regards to different forms 
of student activism, what do you 
feel like the administration is most 
receptive to?

MH: Student activism is an 

important part of the culture 
of 
change 
at 
the 
University 

of Michigan — it has been for 

years and it always will be. The 
administration respects that and 
we actually embrace that. I think 
it’s important for students who are 
involved in activism to be able to 
get information to understand 
the issue, to understand what you 
want to change, understand what’s 
currently here and then move 
forward with what you want. That 
doesn’t mean that everyone will 
always agree, but that means that 
we need to have a dialogue, to create 
change together. Sometimes you 
can change the institution and make 
progress — even though it may not 
be to the extent that students want 
— over a period of time. We want 
students to understand that they do 
make a difference with everything 
that they do.

Commemorating Women’s History 

Month: 5 impactful Wolverine 

female leaders

From three-time Olympian to the second longest-serving 
congresswoman, The Michigan Daily honors U-M women

RONI KANE, 

CARLIN PENDELL , 

& SEJAL PETIL
Daily News Editor & 
Daily Staff Reporters

“Across the U.S. and at the Uni-

versity of Michigan, March was 
Women’s History Month. In 1980, 
President Jimmy Carter declared 
the week of March 8 “Women’s 
History Week,” but it was not 
until 1987 that the National 
Women’s History Alliance suc-
cessfully petitioned Congress 
to dedicate the entire month 
to commemorating the accom-
plishments of women in the 
United States.

The University admitted the 

first female students in 1870, 
over 50 years after it was found-
ed in 1817, and the first women’s 
residence halls were opened in 
1915. Since then, the Michigan 
League was built as a space to 
support women on campus and 
the Center for the Education of 
Women (CEW+) was founded 
to provide women and under-
served students with financial 
and academic support.

Activism for women’s rights 

at the University has persist-
ed into the present day, with 
community members continu-
ing to call for support for both 
reproductive rights and sexual 
assault survivors, among other 
things.

In celebration of Women’s 

History Month, The Michigan 
Daily is commemorating the 
life and legacy of five influential 

Wolverine women who have 
made, and continue to make, 
an impact on the campus com-
munity.

1. Susan Collins
Provost Susan M. Collins, 

executive vice president for aca-
demic affairs, was appointed 
on July 6, 2020, after serving as 
interim provost since January 
2020 following the firing of for-
mer Provost Martin Philbert. 
Before her tenure at the Univer-
sity, Collins was Public Policy 
Dean, an economics professor 
at Georgetown University and 
an associate economics profes-
sor at Harvard University. 

In an interview with The 

Daily, Collins said bearing wit-
ness to the incredible diversity 
of the University’s 19 schools 
and colleges was one of her 
favorite parts of being provost. 
She said the initiatives she 
worked on to support student 
mental health and wellness are 
some of her proudest accom-
plishments to date.

“That’s an initiative that is a 

joint partnership between the 
provost’s office — so academic 
space — and student life,” Col-
lins said. “We want students to 
thrive, and given the challenges 
that were exacerbated by the 
pandemic and our racial reck-
oning, it’s just really important 
to (support students).”

Collins will step down from 

her role as provost on May 15 
to serve as president and CEO 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Boston. In her new position, she 
will also participate in national 

monetary policymaking as a part 
of the Federal Open Market 
Committee.

In light of her retirement, the 

University’s Board of Regents 
unanimously voted on March 24 
to award Collins with a Regents’ 
Citation of Honor for her dedica-
tion to her role at the University.

Collins said she thinks her 

identity as a woman of Color has 
positively impacted her style of 
leadership, emphasizing that 
too often she finds herself to be 
the only woman of Color in the 
room.

“Too often there’s a sense that 

if you talk about being a Black 
woman, for example, it down-
plays your ability to be seen as 
a strong leader,” Collins said. 
“I think we need to push back 
on that. Women have so much 
to offer, people of Color have so 
much to offer, and we need to 
listen to one another and work 
together in those spaces and rec-
ognize that there’s not only one 
way to lead and to make a differ-
ence.”

At their meeting on March 

24, the regents approved Den-
tistry Dean Laurie K. McCauley 
to replace Collins and serve as the 
University’s next provost and vice 
president for academic affairs. In 
an email to The Daily, McCau-
ley commended Collins for her 
involvement in the campus com-
munity, a quality McCauley said 
she hopes to emulate.

 Zimmerman, Hillman of EnvisionBlue 

elected as next CSG president, VP

 Over 1,900 ballots submitted in University-wide election, ballot 

proposal results released

SAMANTHA RICH

Daily Staff Reporter

LSA juniors Noah Zimmer-

man and Jackie Hillman of the 
EnvisionBlue party will be the 
next CSG president and vice 
president, according to prelimi-
nary election results obtained 
by The Michigan Daily shortly 
after voting closed Thursday 
night. Zimmerman and Hill-
man ran against LSA junior 
Erica Nelson and LSA sopho-
more Ronald Burgaj of the 
Diverse&Dedicated party. On 
March 24, both CSG executive 
tickets participated in a debate 
hosted by CSG Election Team 
and The Daily to share their 
platform and policy ideas. 

Following notification of the 

results, Zimmerman and Hill-
man expressed their gratitude 
and desire to get to work as 
soon as possible. In an inter-
view with The Daily Friday 
morning, Zimmerman said he 
looks forward to representing 
the student body.

“We’re here to impact stu-

dents’ everyday lives,” Zim-
merman said. “We’re here to 
represent the broad range of 
students on campus and we’re 
hoping to be able to be success-
ful in doing that.”

Hillman told The Daily she 

wanted to thank students who 
voted and said she is excited to 
create positive change.

“We’re incredibly grateful 

to everyone who showed up 
to vote,” Hillman said. “We’re 
excited to actually work on the 
projects that we’ve been talking 
about, starting right now.” 

Nelson and Burgaj did not 

respond to The Daily for com-
ment in time for publication. 

The EnvisionBlue platform 

ran on 30 policy action items 
and 15 advocacy initiatives 
centered on themes including 
accessibility and affordability 
for all students, addressing the 
University’s history of sexual 
misconduct 
and 
increasing 

student engagement with CSG 
initiatives and elections. Zim-
merman and Hillman are plan-
ning to reorganize the CSG 
executive branch before tack-
ling their specific initiatives.

“We think that the best 

way for our executive branch 
to operate efficiently and get 
any of the projects, any of the 
advocacy that we want done is 
to make sure that we’re having 
the organization and structure 
within our team to be able to 
adequately do that,” Zimmer-
man said. 

In addition to electing exec-

utives, students voted for rep-
resentatives to CSG for their 
college — 15 for LSA, seven for 
Rackham Graduate School, six 
for the College of Engineer-
ing, three for the Ross School 
of Business, and one for each of 
the remaining undergraduate 
and graduate schools. Students 
also elected 19 LSA assembly 
members and the University of 
Michigan Police Department 
(UMPD) Oversight Committee 
student representative. 

Below are the preliminary 

results for the top-voted repre-
sentatives:

LSA: Emma Sklar

“WAIT, WHY DO you look so familiar?” 

Before I could even ask a question, LSA senior 
Cam Turner was interviewing me instead. 
I have to laugh because I know exactly why 
I look so familiar to him — he was an RA in 
my freshman dorm. It’s not the only thing 
we have in common, either. We’re both from 
the South, him from Georgia and myself 
from Tennessee, and we’re both passionate 
about the one thing that binds all Southerners 
together: Waffle House. 

“This all started with Dr. (Eric) Fretz’s 

Entrepreneurial Creativity class,” Turner 
said in an interview with The Michigan Daily, 
“we needed a project … then that one kind of 
stuck for whatever reason.” He’s referring to 
Michigan Waffle House, the Instagram cam-
paign to “bring the state of Michigan its first 
Waffle House franchise.” Turner is one of five 

founding campaign members: Zach Simp-
son, Leo Samba — whom he called “the other 
(Southerner)” — Harshith Vempati and Nikhil 
Tangella round out the team. Back in the fall 
of 2020, the five were charged with designing 
a movement or campaign that solved an issue 
on campus, and Michigan Waffle House was 
born as a solution for two things: the absence 
of a Waffle House in Michigan and the lack of 
affordable late-night food on campus.

The movement exists largely on Insta-

gram, and it’s only grown since its concep-
tion. In December of 2020, the page had 650 
followers, and at the time of the interview, 
that number had grown to 1,180. When asked 
about that growth, Turner said that “hitting 
1,000 followers is like a milestone … that’s a 
decent following.” The group has expanded 
into selling merchandise (“waffledrip”), pro-
ducing Waffle House parodies of pop music 
(“waffletunes”) and, most recently, hosting 
Waffle Day in campus dining halls. 

Waffle Day, the Waffle House–inspired 

dinner at every dining hall on campus, was 
“a fever dream” for the group. “It was initially 
supposed to be only MoJo,” Turner said, “but 
we were able to hype it up and get every din-
ing hall on campus.” Waffle Day included 
waffles, topping bars and an assortment of 
other breakfast foods all served in the dining 
halls. The event was a huge success. “Turn-
outs were great … we’re spreading aware-
ness that we don’t have a Waffle House … 
and people seemed to enjoy it,” Turner said. 
Instagram posts captured lengthy lines and 
large groups of students partaking in Waffle 
Day, and it was promoted on the University’s 
student Instagram page. Turner cited post-
ers around campus and social media as major 
promotional tools for Waffle Day, adding that 
these allowed students to “engage in some of 
the hype that we’re trying to build.”

When asked what had been more crucial to 

their growth, social media presence or events 
like Waffle Day, Turner said that it was “100% 
social media.” He referenced their popular 

photoshopped pictures of celebrities wearing 
Michigan Waffle House merch, which Turn-
er called “super effective in terms of repost 
value,” and graphics and artwork inserting 
Michigan Waffle House into various U-M 
locations like the Big House. “It’s the language 
of Gen Z,” Turner said about their use of social 
media as the campaign’s primary catalyst. “So 
we knew that that would be our main attack-
ing strategy.” 

The strategy has been successful: Michi-

gan Waffle House has been featured on the 
University’s Barstool page and reposted on 
the University Instagram. The campaign’s 
meteoric growth and endorsements have led 
Turner and crew to consider pitching the idea 
of a Waffle House in Michigan to the corpo-
ration itself and just how much of a role their 
online presence would play in such a proposal. 
“Social media would 100% play,” Turner said. 
Referring to the artwork and parody celebrity 
endorsements on their Instagram, he added, 
“It’s kind of a cool, new form of marketing and 

cool way of using our social media platform … 
and as much fun as we’re having, we’re actu-
ally serious.” Turner said that “our goal this 
year was just to make enough noise, to build 
a bigger following so that … they can’t ignore 
us.” 

And because I am also a student and a self-

admitted nosy person, I couldn’t leave the call 
without asking what score they received on 
this project. “Not to brag here,” Turner said, 
“but I think we were the second highest rated 
project in the group. We did win people’s 
choice award in the class, though, so that was 
pretty cool. I think people really fell in love 
with the freshness, and the newness and the 
creativity behind it.” He was, as he had been 
the entire call, spot on about how the Uni-
versity community has received Michigan 
Waffle House.

“People want to be together,” Turner 

added before we hung up. “And want to have 
a similar thing that binds them together, and 
for us, it would be waffles.”

LIKE FINDING A dollar bill on the 

ground, like the rainbow after a sum-
mer afternoon rainfall, like the perfect 
ointment to a wound that won’t heal; as 
soft as a forehead kiss, as captivating as 
a cloudless night sky, as soothing as a 
spoonful of honey running down your 
throat when that brief rainfall soaked 
your clothes, and you caught a cold… 
Holly Humberstone is all of that.

The pandemic turned days into nights 

and nights into days, in what felt like an 
endless cycle of nothingness. In those 
monotonous months, I took the time to 
dust off the shelves of my room — for 
every book I picked up, I made sure that 
the music playing in the background was 
fitting. I found that Humberstone’s music 
never necessitated me putting down my 
book to skip a song.

Fast forward two years later, there I 

was — second row, close enough to mouth 
“thank you,” but far enough to still be a 

fan among a predominantly young and 
female crowd. On the 12th night of the “if 
i could make it go quiet” tour led by girl 
in red, Humberstone put on a show supe-
rior to that of the average opener. In the 
heat of excitement mixed with excessive 

clothing from a prolonged winter, I was 
ready to sing along to every lyric.

The concert began with “Overkill,” a 

song off of her first EP. In the confines of 
a one-man setup, Humberstone emulated 
the performance style of artists such as 

Tash Sultana or Bon Iver. A pair of light 
blue jeans, a ‘90s tee and a white Stra-
tocaster were enough to make Humber-
stone a magnet to the hundreds of eyes in 
a sold out Majestic Theater. 

The 22-year-old artist stunned the 

crowd with every movement — swaying 
gracefully between two keyboards and 
three mics, blending the rawness of her 
sweet tone with melodies distorted by a 
vocoder in a manner evocative of Imogen 
Heap. With the click of a pad, a backing 
track became the ground from which the 
seeds of her essence bloomed.

Lyrics pickled with a bitterness famil-

iar to adolescent heartbreak, friendship 
fallout and self-found solace, Humber-
stone becomes the intermediary between 
one’s unspoken thoughts and the comfort 
of saying nothing at all. She writes songs 
for someone else, yet you’re left with the 
conviction that they could well have been 
made for you. A perfectly tailored suit, a 
minutely planned day, finally growing 
into the shoes you inherited from your 
older sister.

Humberstone went on to sing an unre-

leased song before explaining that she 
had spent a nauseous, restless night after 
eating a salad from a deli in Toronto. 
Despite the incident, Humberstone’s 
eight songs left the audience wanting 
more. 

To curb that hunger, she stated that 

she would send a secret demo of an unre-
leased song titled “Room Service” to any-
one who messaged her on Instagram. A 
link to a SoundCloud song with under 
2,000 streams seemed not only a sweet 
treat but also a good marketing strategy 
— I am positive at least 50 of those are 
mine, and it has only been a day.

With 
her 
soft-spoken, 
endearing 

voice, Humberstone found the perfect 
balance between linking tunes consecu-
tively and making small confessions 
about her songs. She explained that her 
debut release, “Deep End,” had been an 
attempt to appease her younger sister, 
who was struggling at the time. I myself 
have found comfort in this song in times 
of distress.

loved every minute of it

THIS 
YEAR’S 
ACADEMY 

Awards, from top to bottom and in 
every conceivable facet, were a com-
plete disaster … and it made for some 
invigorating television. Unsurprising-
ly, a bunch of producers desperately 
trying to keep an irrelevant awards 
show relevant led to an amalgamation 
of appeals to different audiences, none 
of which actually want to watch the 
Oscars in the first place.

If the Academy Awards is supposed 

to be a show for film lovers, it prob-
ably wasn’t a good idea to wait until 
20 minutes into the show to actually 
start talking about movies. Instead, 
the telecast began with a performance 
by Beyoncé of her song “Be Alive,” a 
song that does not appear in “King 
Richard” until the end credits and was 
recorded for the sole purpose of get-
ting nominated for this award. Sure, 
having Beyoncé perform during the 
broadcast might entice more viewers 
to watch, but is it really worth cutting 
numerous important categories to 
make room for the performance of a 
song with about seven million listens 
on Spotify? 

By turning the Oscars into the 

Grammys, all the musical numbers 
meant that the producers of the show 
cut major categories like Best Editing 
and Best Visual Effects — both cat-
egories that typically recognize mov-
ies that a broader audience has seen 
— in order to save time. And yet, the 
broadcast went on for over 20 minutes 
longer than last year’s. Thanks to the 
reintroduction of a host to the ceremo-
ny — in this case three: Amy Schumer, 
Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall — the 
broadcast stole time from the count-

less behind-the-scenes crew members 
who won awards and the likes of Best 
International Feature winner Ryu-
suke Hamaguchi, who could only get 
a measly 52 words in before they tried 
to play him off. All so the three hosts 
could tell bad jokes about one of the 
better Best Picture nominees being 
boring and do terrible bits like calling 
famous actress and Best Supporting 
Actress nominee Kirsten Dunst a seat-
filler. If the Academy was going to go 
back to having a host despite three 
years of positive reviews regarding 
the lack of a host, perhaps they should 
have gone with one that actually likes 
and cares about the art of film. But 
maybe that’s asking too much of an 
awards show honoring the art of film.

Another bizarre decision was to 

include two “fan-voted” categories: 
One for the “Oscars Cheer Moment” 
and one for the “Oscars Fan Favorite.” 
Fans voted online for their favorite in 
each, and the results were as moron-
ic as you would expect. The cult of 
Zack Snyder came out in full force to 
claim both prizes for “Flash Enters 
The Speed Force” in “Zack Snyder’s 
Justice League” and “Army of the 
Dead” in both categories, respectively. 
Other films included in the so-short-
it’s-not-even-worth-showing top five 
montages were Marvel movies galore, 
“Dreamgirls,” Camila Cabello’s “Cin-
derella” and the Johnny Depp-led 
“Minamata.” Give the internet an 
inch and it will take a mile. These cat-
egories were treated as nothing but a 
joke by viewers from the start, reek-
ing of desperation from the producers 
of the show to pander to new viewers 
who are not at all interested in being 
catered to.

‘Nasty, Brutish and Short’: Professor Scott 
Hershovitz on why the best philosophers are 

children

Why we tell the story: MUSKET’s production of ‘Once on This Island’

Ben Afeck has a better relationship with snails than Ana de Armas in ‘Deep Water’

This interview was edited for 

length and clarity.

IN HIS NEW book “Nasty, 

Brutish, and Short: Adventures 
in Philosophy With My Kids,” 
Scott Hershovitz, professor of 
law and philosophy at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, shatters the 
notion that philosophy should 
be reserved for the ivory tower. 
Some of the best philosophers, he 
explains, are children. Naive and 
unabashed, children are unafraid 
to question things we as adults 
take for granted. Hershovitz’s 
own precocious sons, Rex and 
Hank, are certainly unafraid to 
question things — especially their 
father’s authority. 

As Rex and Hank pose philo-

sophical questions (Does the 
number six exist? Do I have 
rights? etc.), Hershovitz uses 
these funny anecdotes as means 
to explore weighty matters rang-
ing from racial and gender equal-
ity to the nature of truth. Often 
lighthearted 
(and 
frequently 

hilarious), “Nasty, Brutish and 
Short” pairs the boys’ observa-
tions with compelling arguments 
from contemporary philosophers 
to provide an accessible intellec-
tual survey of many of philoso-
phy’s greatest questions.

On a dreary Thursday morn-

ing, I interviewed Professor Her-
shovitz. Our conversation ranged 
from Taylor Swift’s beef with 
Kanye to Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson’s 
appointment, 
from 

recapturing the wonder of child-
hood to the goals of studying phi-
losophy. Here’s what Hershovitz 
had to share:

The Michigan Daily: The cen-

tral premise of this book is that 
kids are great philosophers. What 
makes kids such great philoso-
phers? How can adults be more 
like kids in this regard?

Scott Hershovitz: I think kids 

are really good philosophers for 
two reasons. First, I think they 
just find the world a really puz-
zling place. They’re dropped 
in, and they don’t understand a 

lot of what’s going on, and they 
have questions about it. Often the 
things they’re questioning are 
things that grown-ups take for 
granted. There’s this line from 
a philosopher who spent a lot of 
time studying kids, Gareth Mat-
thews, who said, “The adult must 
cultivate the naïveté required for 
doing philosophy, but to a child, 
such naïveté is entirely natural.” 
So I think that’s the first reason 
kids make really good philoso-
phers. 

The second reason is they’re 

not worried about seeming silly. 
They’re willing to ask questions 
that a lot of adults wouldn’t ask 
out loud, or signal to other people 
that they were thinking about, 
or maybe even think that they 
should think about themselves. 
So they’re willing to ask ques-
tions like, “Am I just dreaming my 
entire life?” or “What is time?” I 
think we actually get socialized 
out of that pretty fast, somewhere 
around age eight or nine years 
old.

As to the second question: How 

can adults be more like kids in 
this regard? Well, part of what 
I’m hoping to do through this 
book is encourage adults to talk 
to kids. Conversations about phi-
losophy with kids can be really 
cool because they can be collab-
orative. There are not a lot of con-
versations you can have with kids 
where each person is bringing 
something to the table. Usually 
you’re teaching a kid something, 
telling them something that they 
don’t know, but if you talk to kids 
about philosophy, they’ve got 
questions that are going to push 
you past your understanding. And 
I think just taking up the con-
versation with them and seeing 
where things go is a way of recap-
turing some of the wonder they 
have about the world.

TMD: I have another serious 

question queued up, but maybe 
we’ll come back to that and mix 
it up a little. So the next question 
is: Was there a single moment that 
inspired you to write this book? 
It seems like you have so many 
hilarious and moving anecdotes 
stored up from over a decade 

worth of parenting. Why wait 
until now?

SH: Around when my old-

est, Rex, was about a year old, I 
started to talk about him when 
I was teaching. He would say or 
do something at home that would 
raise a philosophy issue that we 
were talking about in class. And 
I just discovered that if we start 
talking about the reading I assign, 
sometimes it’s difficult to get a 
conversation going. But if I come 
into class and I say, “Hey, let me 
tell you about this thing my kid 
did,” everyone finds it relatable 
and fun to talk about. And we can 
talk about Rex for a few minutes, 
and then I can say, “Ah, now how 
does this relate to the reading that 
was assigned for today?”

One evening I was at another 

university presenting a paper, and 
I was having trouble getting peo-
ple there to see what the problem 
was. And I did it with them. I said, 
“Hey, let me tell you a story about 
my little guy, Hank. And here’s 
something he said, which kind of 
illustrates this issue.”

Almost immediately, people 

understood the formerly confus-
ing issue. And then a friend of 
mine, who published a popular 
book in philosophy, Aaron James, 
leaned across the table, and he 
said, “That’s your book right 
there.” That was what really got 
me thinking that, “Oh, this thing 
I do with my students, and now 
sometimes with my colleagues, I 
could just do with a broader audi-
ence.” I really love philosophy, 
and I want more people to get 
engaged with it. I realized these 
stories are a way of helping bring 
people in.

TMD: Your book addresses 

serious ethical questions around 
transgender rights and racism, 
authority and revenge. Each of 
these discussions begins with a 
conversation you had with one of 
your kids. How young is too young 
to learn about evil in the world? 
How can you balance preserving 
their innocence with producing 
moral, compassionate children?

THIS PAST WEEKEND, The Uni-

versity of Michigan’s “Michigan Union 
Shows, Ko-Eds, Too” (MUSKET) pro-
duced “Once on This Island,” a stunning 
one-act musical by Lynn Ahrens and Ste-
phen Flaherty. Performed in the Power 
Center, “Once on This Island” is based 
on a book by Rosa Guy entitled, “My 
Love, My Love, or The Peasant Girl.” In 
it, an orphaned peasant girl, Ti Moune 
(played by the radiant Simone Clotile, a 
Music, Theatre & Dance junior) lives on 
an island in the French Antilles and falls 
in love with a “grande homme” (or “beau-
tiful man”), a wealthy, lighter-skinned 
man named Daniel Beauxhomme played 
by the brilliant Myles Mathews, a Music, 
Theatre & Dance freshman. Though her 
love for Daniel is so strong, Ti Moune 
will never be able to marry him because 
of where she is from. Directed and cho-
reographed by Music, Theatre & Dance 
juniors Chloe Cuff and Brooke Taylor, 
and Music, Theatre & Dance sophomore 
Cristina Benn, MUSKET’s “Once on This 
Island” uses community and love to com-

bat colorism and classism.

While audiences were filing into the 

vast Power Center, the cast was already 
on stage, playing with soccer balls, danc-
ing to drums and socializing with each 
other. This pre-show created an oppor-
tunity for the audience to see a glimpse 
of life in the French Antilles and estab-

lished a powerful sense of community 
that was carried throughout the rest 
of the show. Not only did the pre-show 
immediately bring the audience into the 

story, but the set, designed by Music, 
Theatre & Dance junior Laurence Vance, 
was incredibly intimate, made of vibrant 
vines, flowers and string lights that one 
would see in a backyard. Additionally, 
the creative team chose to set the band on 
stage as well, furthering the strong sense 
of togetherness. The visual of the com-

munity on stage in such an intimate and 
familiar setting made the Power Center 
feel three times smaller and made it prac-
tically impossible not to become com-

pletely immersed in Ti Moune’s story. 

Music, an important part of the cul-

ture on the island, was something that 
bonded the community. It connected the 
peasants to each other as well as to the 
gods. For instance, in Ti Moune’s first 
solo, “Waiting For Life to Begin,” she 
sings “Oh gods, oh gods hear my prayer,” 
asking them to show her her purpose. In 
fact, the very first musical number of the 
show starts with the lyrics, “Asaka, grow 
me a garden, please Agwe don’t flood 
my garden, Erzulie, who will my love be, 
Papa Ge, don’t come around me,” signal-
ing that the people use music as a way 
of communicating with the gods, which 
are at the core of their community. The 
music would not have been so central to 
the story without the thoughtful work 
of the Music Director Dominic Dorset, a 
Music, Theatre & Dance senior.

Similarly, dance is used throughout 

the show to signal community. Taylor’s 
choreography had heavy African influ-
ences, a nod to the characters’ ances-
tors and culture. This was highlighted 
in one of the most beautiful moments of 
the show, in which Ti Moune is asked to 
dance at the ball. She looks down at her 
feet, removes her city shoes and begins 
to dance the way she would at home. 
Eventually, two peasant servants join Ti 
Moune in her dance, immediately famil-
iar with its steps and rhythm, showcasing 

their communal ties and unity surround-
ing dance. This moment was incredibly 
unique to MUSKET’s production.

Not only does dance ground the com-

munity, but so does their connection 
to the earth. Through a gorgeous and 
thoughtful set, costume design and 
direction, the creative team displayed 
the intersection of the earth and spiri-
tuality. Each god had an eye makeup 
design symbolizing what they repre-
sented. For instance, Agwe, god of water, 
played beautifully by Rackham student 
Algernon Robinson, wore blue highlights 
around his eyes, while the other gods 
wore their respective colors. Cuff bril-
liantly chose to have ensemble members 
play birds, trees and frogs, illustrating 
their close connection and appreciation 
for the earth. This was complemented by 
the beautiful lighting design by Music, 
Theatre & Dance junior Abi Farnsworth. 
What was the most striking, however, 
was that at the end of the story, when 
Ti Moune sacrifices her life for Daniel 
because of her love for him, she becomes 
a tree that watches over Daniel and is 
welcomed back into the earth by the 
gods. 

MUSKET’s “Once on This Island” 

teaches audiences that love prevails. In 
the face of hate and discrimination, love 
and community are what allow us to 
thrive.

IF THERE IS such a thing as a libi-

do for cinema, then I will say the 2022 
film “Deep Water” actively makes 
my desire to watch movies plummet. 
Which is ironic, because this so-called 
erotic thriller clearly wants to make 
its audience horny. But even Ana de 
Armas (“No Time to Die”) can’t save 
the movie equivalent of lathering your 
tastebuds with mayonnaise for two 
hours. It has a decently-sized budget 
and was funded by a major studio, but 
there is no real desire or spark on-
screen from the cast or crew. Every-
one involved seems solely interested 
in filler movies to buff up their IMDb 
profile; it’s as generic as it gets. It’s so 
vanilla that it’s difficult to come up 

with interesting words to describe it. 

The film is about couple Vic (Ben 

Affleck, “Gone Girl”) and Melinda 
(de Armas), who are in a precarious 
agreement to keep their marriage 
intact (ironically, the actors could 
not keep their relationship intact long 
enough for this movie to be released, 
since they got together and subse-
quently broke up between the movie 
being made and distributed). In order 
to keep the family together, Melinda 
is allowed to have affairs with whom-
ever she wants. Naturally, this ends 
up bothering Vic, and he becomes the 
object of suspicion when things start 
happening to Melinda’s lovers.

Because of this relationship, the 

audience is treated to a constantly 
sulking Affleck, which is at first 
quite amusing, but eventually, like 
almost everything else in this film, 

becomes deliriously dull. De Armas 
is unhinged, and her character is very 
unlikeable, with her constantly mak-
ing irrational decisions. They have 
a daughter, who one might imag-
ine would be Vic’s primary object of 
affection if he wasn’t so obsessed 
with snails. Yeah, Vic has a garage-
sized collection of live snails — which 
brings me to the parts of the film I 
was most invested in: multiple scenes 
of Ben Affleck carefully caressing 
these pans of snails. Even though they 
were by far the most exciting aspect 
of the movie, the snails were not what 
elicited the rawest emotion in me. 
That award goes to the jump cut from 
the movie’s most intense sex scene to 
a little league soccer game.

The film is supposed to have loads 

of suspense and psychological ten-
sion, but it’s difficult for the suspense 

to work if the most thrilling scene in 
the film involves an SUV and a bicy-
cle in a generic park. And there can’t 
be psychological tension if both lead 
characters can be figured out in the 
first few scenes. After the first half-
hour or so, Vic and Melinda’s behav-
iors can be predicted very easily, 
which makes the remaining 90 min-
utes a snoozefest interspersed with 
the occasional Affleck-approved sulk 
or snail. 

The ending is double-take-induc-

ing; I was genuinely baffled by the 
swift whimper that was the climax 
and resolution. The established char-
acter traits and motivations fly out 
the window. The last few minutes are 
so anticlimactic that I actually cack-
led when the credits started rolling. 
There is pretty much no buildup or 
logical continuity that really explains 

this ending. 

The biggest issue with this movie is 

just how unexciting the viewing expe-
rience was. It wasn’t bad in the sense 
that it was bizarre or abrasive, and it 
certainly wasn’t so offbeat that it was 
funny. It was just bland. There was no 
risk at all. I would much rather have 
watched a poorly-staged, low-budget 
camp-fest than something like this, 
which was technically well-made and 
technically well-acted. It was made 
with all the current technology, and 
you can definitely see the money on 
screen, but there is no flair, no pas-
sion at all. It feels like it was made 
for a paycheck, which is sad because 
it was director Adrian Lyne’s (“Fatal 
Attraction”) return to directing fea-
tures after a two-decade hiatus. 
Honestly, he should’ve just made the 
whole movie about snails.

One out of eight men believes 

that he could score against Serena 
Williams in a tennis match. This, to 
me, is the epitome of delusion. 

Saying that someone is delusional 

often 
conjures 
up 
images 
of 

raging schizophrenics, completely 
absorbed by illusions of grandeur 
and hallucinations of voices from 
nowhere, people who don’t exist 
and events that never happened. 
But in reality, self-delusion is more 
subtle and ordinary. It’s the belief 
that you “totally could’ve gone pro 
if it wasn’t for your knee injury” or 
“definitely could’ve gone to an Ivy 
League if I cared in high school.” 
It’s that little voice telling you that 
you’re on the precipice of being 
great at whatever thing you’re 
mediocre at. It’s the voice telling 
one out of eight men that he could 
outplay Serena Williams.

According to this definition I, 

for one, am highly delusional. This 
diagnosis rests on the fact that I 
wholeheartedly believe that I could 
get a 180, a perfect score, on the 
Law School Admission Test (LSAT) 
with no preparation. To most, this 
may seem insane and completely 
unfounded given that (A) I have 
no intentions of ever going to law 
school, let alone taking the LSAT; 
(B) 0.1% of LSAT takers score a 
180; (C) at the time of writing this, 
I have no familiarity with the 
sections of the LSAT and (D) I have 
embarrassingly limited knowledge 
about the inner workings of the U.S. 
legal system

To these limitations, I offer one 

rebuttal: puzzle games.

I am excellent at puzzle games, 

and I say this objectively. Sudoku 
puzzles were my first love in the 
fifth grade; my teacher used to 
assign them in lieu of extra credit. 
From there my obsession spiraled 
into Words with Friends, The New 
Yorker’s Cryptic Crosswords, The 

New York Times’s Spelling Bee 
and, of course, Wordle and its many 
variants. Everyday, I go through the 
same repertoire of puzzle games: 
Wordle before bed, sudoku while 
I eat breakfast, The New Yorker 
crossword to kill time in class 
and NYT’s mini crossword in the 
evenings. 

The one thing I do know about the 

LSAT is that there’s an analytical 
reasoning section, better known 
as “logic games.” Peers, typically 
those who are not familiar with 
the LSAT, will occasionally make 
remarks like “the LSAT is basically 
all just puzzles.” I’m sure they don’t 
mean that literally. But on some 
level, I must’ve internalized that 
notion. And thus, my delusional 
confidence that I’m destined for a 
perfect LSAT score was born.

I wasn’t serious the first time 

I 
pronounced 
my 
belief. 
My 

roommate was talking about their 
upcoming LSAT test day, and I 
jokingly told them I thought I could 
get a 180. It wasn’t something I had 
thought about before, but when I 
said it, it felt right. Other people 
score 180s for all sorts of reasons — 
studying hard, natural ability, etc. 
Why was a dedication to puzzles 
any less of a justification? And just 
like that, a delusion was born. 

Perhaps many delusions are 

born everyday without us realizing. 
In my experience, University of 
Michigan students are particularly 
susceptible to them. We go to a top 
school but not the top school. A 
lot of us do well in our classes but 
don’t have perfect grades. Many 
Wolverines might not get into their 
first-choice 
graduate 
program 

or land their top internship, but 
they usually manage to come out 
relatively successful. I think this 
phenomenon of excelling without 
ever being number one — making 
the podium but always scoring 
bronze — is a recipe for delusion.

In 
1954, 
psychologist 
Leon 

Festinger 
developed 
social 

comparison 
theory, 

which 
holds 
that 

humans 
have 
an 

innate 
drive 
to 

compare themselves 
with others. Within 
this theory are two 
types of comparison: 
downward 
(comparing yourself 
to someone “worse” 
than you to boost your 
self-confidence) and 
upward 
(comparing 

yourself to someone 
“better” than you to 
motivate yourself). 

Festinger 
had 

clearly 
never 
met 

a 
University 
of 

Michigan student, or 
at least a delusional one, because 
many of us seem to do the opposite. 
When 
the 
typical 
Wolverine 

doesn’t land the internship they 
wanted, they don’t seriously reflect 
on how much effort they put into 
their résumé or if the position 
was even a good fit. Instead, 
they convince themselves that 
they never wanted it in the first 
place, or that the company isn’t 
even that good, or any number of 
justifications designed to protect 
their sense of self. To the delusional 
mind, upward social comparison 
isn’t about motivation, it’s about 
re-calibration. If you’re literally 
incapable of comprehending that 
someone might be better than 
you, then you need to upwardly 
adjust your perception of yourself 
accordingly. 

Our collective status as under-

achieving 
over-achievers, 
as 

students of a “Public Ivy,” means 
that our lives are packed with 
downward and upward social 
comparison. 
But 
constantly 

comparing yourself to others and 
feeling uncertain where you stand 
relative to your peers can shake a 
person’s sense of self. Cognitive 
dissonance theory, another idea of 

Leon Festinger’s, “postulates that 
an underlying psychological tension 
is created when an individual’s 
behavior is inconsistent with his 
or her thoughts and beliefs.” This 
tension motivates people to adjust 
their actions and beliefs to be 
consistent with one another. For 
example, a more psychologically 
grounded student might improve 
their study habits to align with their 
belief that they are a successful 
student.

But it seems that my fellow 

delusional 
Michigan 
students 

and I have chosen to adjust just 
our beliefs. It’s easier — and more 
comfortable — to overinflate your 
self-perception than to genuinely 
work at bettering your abilities. 
Increasing your abilities means 
confronting 
your 
actual 
skill 

level and trying to bridge the 
gap between your constructed 
and actual self. Self-delusion, on 
the other hand, requires no such 
negotiation. 

Moreover, 
positive 
self-

perception can quickly become 
arrogance, as evidenced by forum 
posts deliberating whether or not 
Michigan students are actually 
“stuck 
up” 
and 
“toxic.” 
For 

Michigan students, this arrogance 
often stems from their inability 
to see themselves clearly. Our 
sky-high self confidence comes 
off as delusional, arrogant and 
untethered from reality. 

Like the onset of my LSAT 

belief, it takes only one comment, 
one moment of fantasizing, to 
internalize an absurd belief. Rather 
than concluding that other people 
have different professional goals or 
aptitudes than me, I decided that I 
must be equally as skilled as those 
dedicated to scoring well on this 
rigorous test. 

In acknowledging my delusion, 

I set out to see just how unrealistic 
scoring a cold 180 actually was. 
My LSAT delusion was not well 
received by those familiar with the 
test. 

Law School student Ryan Comrie 

began studying for the LSAT before 
his senior year of college and bought 
multiple test-prep materials. 

Beyond gaining familiarity with 

the test format, he learned that “the 
time component is a huge part of 
(the LSAT).” Each section is just 
35 minutes, so being able to solve 
problems quickly is crucial for 
scoring well. “The first time that I 

did a logic game, I took as long as I 
needed,” he explained. “Then, the 
challenge is figuring out how to do 
them quickly.” 

Comrie was skeptical of my 

puzzle-based 
strategy, 
saying, 

“I guess if you were really good 
at puzzles, like really good, like 
historically good, you could do 
really well (on the LSAT) on the 
first try, in that time constraint.” 
He did say that my natural talent 
would give me a leg up on the 
logical reasoning section … if I were 
to actually study. 

My roommate, who is applying 

to law school next year and has 
taken the LSAT, put it more bluntly 
in a text: “Getting a 180 on the 
LSAT would be like me performing 
a quadruple bypass and nailing 
it because I watched ‘Grey’s 
(Anatomy),’” he said.

My boyfriend let me down 

the most gently. “I know you test 
well,” he said. “But I think that you 
thinking that you can get a perfect 
score on the LSAT without any 
practice is unfair to lawyers who 
spend half a year studying — those

Our Uncanny Reality

Recently, I learned that the 

animatronics in the “It’s a Small 
World” ride at Disneyland never 
turn off.

After all the park visitors go 

home, all of the lights turn off; after 
the music stops and the gates are 
locked, the little dolls don’t stop 
moving around the track. The tiny, 
smiling figurines keep waving and 
dancing and swinging around their 
fake little lassos. In the dark. In 
total silence. 

In one word: scary. In three: 

really fucking scary. 

That sense of unease we feel 

isn’t novel — it’s derived from 
a phenomenon known as the 
uncanny valley, a term used to 
describe that eerie feeling we 
get when we see something not-
quite-human. Japanese roboticist 
Masahiro Mori coined the term in 
1970 after realizing that the more 
a robot resembled a human being, 
the more empathy a person would 
feel toward it. But, once it passed 
a certain threshold — once the 
robot looked practically identical 
to a human without being quite 
indistinguishable — people started 
feeling unnerved. 

It’s that not-quite-rightness that 

makes the animation of “The Polar 
Express” just a little creepy, and 
sends a shiver down your spine 
when you answer the phone to a 
particularly 
life-like 
automated 

voice. 
Think 
of 
the 
movie 

“WALL-E” in contrast — he doesn’t 
attempt to look human and in fact 
looks classically robotic. So, we feel 
none of the same eeriness we feel 
toward the characters in “The Polar 
Express.”

The animatronics in “It’s a Small 

World” don’t look all that realistic. 
Their bodies are fairly small, all of 

their facial features are extremely 
rounded and their movements are 
simple and isolated — an arm going 
up and down to hit a drum, hands 
clapping. 

What’s uncanny about them, 

though, is that they continue to 
perform, even when they don’t have 
an audience. 

I learned about the ride’s eerie 

fact on Instagram — where I 
consume the ultimate mix of 
pictures of people I know, pictures 
of people I wish I knew and loads of 
useless information I’ll never have 
an application for. 

But the uncanny valley isn’t 

restricted to animation and robots. 
As technology creeps more and 
more into our lives — and our lives 
creep more and more into the realm 
of technology — aspects of our 
reality may begin to feel uncanny — 
mainly social media.

Think about the act of posting on 

Instagram: You craft a post aimed 
at no one in particular and send it 
off to a faceless mass of followers to 
judge your digital footprint. 

But, just like the “Small World” 

ride, you have no idea whether your 
online audience is there. Hundreds 
of people might be looking at your 
photo at any given second. Or none 
might be. Either way, it becomes 
part of your profile, the digital 
approximation of “you.” 

Just like the dolls engaged in 

their ceaseless dance in California’s 
Disneyland, still dancing as I’m 
typing this, there is no “off” button 
for our digital personas. Our digital 
selves work around the clock. 

I know plenty of people who 

have taken “social media breaks” to 
temporarily escape the pressure of 
that online image. But even when 
people have checked out and deleted 
the app, their digital approximation 
is still there. Unless they fully delete 
their account, their public image 

remains published, waiting to be 
looked at, judged. Just like the tiny, 
spinning animatronics, our profiles 
are always performing, regardless 
of whether or not anyone’s there. 

Still, this reality doesn’t give 

me the same chills as poorly done 
CGI or hyper-realistic baby 
dolls. If social media 
functions in a 
way much similar 
to the characters 
in the “It’s a Small 
World” ride, why doesn’t it feel as 
unsettling? 

Maybe it’s because we’re able to 

distinguish between social media 
and real life fairly easily. I cannot 
count the number of times I’ve 
read or heard something telling 
me not to trust the things I see on 
social media. It’s a highlight reel. 
It’s touched up. It’s a competition 
to see who has the most friends, 
whose life is the most aesthetically 
pleasing, who looked the best on 
Spring Break.

Or, maybe, social media has 

become so entrenched in our 
perception of reality that it’s 
become 
indistinguishable 
from 

real life. While in the past, we 
could always see the unsettling 
delineation between social media 
and reality, we’ve evolved past the 
awareness of the uncanny valley. 
There’s a calculated casualness to 
our social media presence — photo 
dumps and seemingly random 
posts aimed at making our profiles 
reflect a beautiful life. 

In the throes of the pandemic, 

I used to do YouTube workout 
classes made by an Australian 
influencer named Chloe Ting. 
She had the most defined abs I’ve 
ever seen, but there was always 
some indefinable quality about 
her that felt off. People heard that 
she was a robot or an animation 
or some kind of AI. But, in a video 

titled “Answering Your 
Assumptions 
About 

Me,” she addresses the 

rumor, claiming to be real.

Still, it wouldn’t have been all 

that surprising if she wasn’t. Lil 
Miquela, “19-year-old Robot,” has 
racked up over 3 million followers 
as a CGI influencer. Her account, 
which started in 2016, features 
hyper-realistic photos of her taking 
trips to Los Angeles, getting ice 
cream and reading. She posted 
a picture last month wearing 
sweatpants that say “I (heart) real 
life.”

The funny thing is that, as 

someone who interacts with the 
two influencers only on social 
media, their robotic status does 
not dictate the ways I interact 
with them online. I consume their 
content in the same way I consume 
a real person’s. I see the things on 
their profiles that they — or in the 
case of Lil Miquela, her creators 
— want me to see. I have my own 
perception of who each of them is, 
even though one of them doesn’t 
exist in a human sense. 

Even though one is decidedly 

real and the other not, they occupy 
the same space for me as a viewer. 
As someone who’s never going 
to meet either in real life, their 
online personas are my only point 
of reference. It doesn’t matter to 
me whether they’re out walking 
around in the world or not, because 
their profiles are always up, proof 
of their existence. Does a physical 

footprint 
mean 
much 
when 
our 

digital 
ones 

can cover so much more ground 
for longer, even infinite, periods of 
time?

20 — or even 10 — years ago, 

questions like this would be 
nonsensical. 

Gen Z has been around since 

the very start of social media. The 
first recognizable social media site, 
called Six Degrees, was created 
in 1997. MySpace launched in 
2003. Facebook came out in 2004. 
Twitter followed in 2006. In both 
their design and function, the 
original social media sites served 
an entirely different purpose than 
they do today.

I 
remember 
when 
I 
first 

downloaded Instagram in 2012, 
about two years after the app first 
came out. I was finishing sixth 
grade, and the first thing I posted 
was an oversaturated picture of a 
Pez dispenser shaped like Ferb from 
“Phineas and Ferb.” I think my next 
photo was posted later that same 
day (there weren’t yet any rules 
advising against multiple posts): 

me, standing in my 
kitchen wearing my 
outfit for the last day 
of school. Also heavily 

edited.

Before 

Instagram 

became widely used enough 

to spawn its own conventions 

— ideas of what’s an acceptable 
number 
of 
likes, 
what 
your 

followers-to-following ratio should 
be, how frequently you should 
or shouldn’t be posting — there 
wasn’t much stake in what was on 
your profile. Instagram was more 
of a mindless game and less of a 
projection of one’s entire essence, 
or what they wish their essence 
was.

While this was the origin of our 

never-ending performance, it didn’t 
resemble reality enough to fall 
under the uncanny valley. No one 
could mistake my Pez-dispenser 
post as an approximation of my 
real life. It was an online forum to 
display what you were up to and the 
kinds of things you liked, not who 
you were at your core.

Now it feels like the things we 

post have some sort of bearing on 
who we are in “real life.” Posting is 
no longer a way to tell people what 
you’re doing but to curate a certain 
brand or aesthetic.

Can love overcome language barriers?

KAVYA UPPALAPATI

Statement Columnist

MichiganDaily.com

Can language barriers within 

a 
relationship 
inhibit 
true 

connection? Popular media begs 
to say “no.” The highly acclaimed 
“Love Actually” features characters 
Jamie and Aurélia — a couple where 
the former speaks English and 
the latter Portuguese. “The Little 
Mermaid” tells the storybook tale of 
Prince Eric and Ariel, the mermaid-
turned-human devoid of a voice. 
Such media romanticizes the idea of 
falling for your one true love despite 
being unable to communicate with 
one another.

But can love truly surpass the 

bounds of language?

While many Hollywood movies 

have a wholesome ending at face 
value — with love triumphing 
over all obstacles — this clean-cut 
conclusion is a shallow portrayal 
of romantic relationships. Rather 
than falling for each other because 
of shared conversation and mutual 
interests, oftentimes, the characters 
pursue physical attributes and 
overall aesthetics of the other 
person. When watching such movies 
I often find myself wondering why 
this 
less-chatter-more-chemistry 

mode of love is glorified. I struggle 
to find the romanticism in being 
unable to speak to your significant 
other. 

As someone who grew up not 

speaking the same language as my 
extended family, I almost see the 
beauty in the connection that comes 
distinctly with a communication-
less 
love. 
However, 
I 
also 

acknowledge the sheer struggle 
of it, of attempting to relate to and 
connect with loved ones while 
tripping over mismatched tongues.

The only family I have in the 

United States are my parents and 
brother, the rest being 8,000 miles 

away in India. Physical distance 
is isolating enough, but my sheer 
inability to speak to older family 
members makes it all the worse. 
While they barely speak English, I 
speak broken Telugu — their native 
language. Although I am blessed 
with technology like WhatsApp 
and 
FaceTime 
that 
facilitates 

international calls and texts, these 
resources provide little help when 
I physically cannot articulate my 
thoughts. 

Conversations with my extended 

family — my grandparents and aunts 
and uncles and cousins — hover at a 
surface level: “How are you?” “What 
are you doing?” “How’s school?” 
“What have you done today?” 
Anything beyond this designated, 
elementary dialogue travels into 
unfamiliar territory. If I try to delve 
into more intricate sentences, I 
will end up jumbling English and 
Telugu words together, leaving my 
grandparents confused. Or, if I ask 
them a question, like “what fun 
things did you do today?” I often get 
a “yes” or “no” response (despite my 
question not having a “yes” or “no” 
answer to it). 

So, when I spent time with my 

grandparents and wanted to indulge 
in complex conversation during the 
rare occasions in my life when they 
came to the U.S. or I visited India, 
I need someone else to translate. 
Thus, we struggle to develop a 
truly genuine understanding of one 
another. My grandparents have 
all lived such rich lives, raising 
families of their own, growing up in 
a generation post-colonization and 
participating in social movements. 
They could provide insight into who 
I am and where I come from. Such 
perspective is something I want to 
learn from; something that seems so 
desperately impossible to access. 

But however impossible the 

process of overcoming a language 

barrier may seem, I’ve found that 
it can foster a whole new kind of 
connection I’d never encountered 
before. My grandparents and I have 
an intimate relationship because we 
know that our love for one another 
is unbounded. In some ways, it is a 
closer bond than I have with most 
people in my life solely because we 
are family. Yes, we struggle through 
our broken sentences when talking 
to each other. Often a conversation 
that could have taken five minutes 
will end up taking 10 minutes. 
But, however frustrating these 
moments are — especially when 
the conversation ends in a mutual 
acceptance of misunderstanding 
— the process of giving up is 
representative of our determination 
to maintain our relationship. 

When we sit next to each other 

silently after many failed attempts 
of conversation, there is a sense of 
connection, of mutual hardship. 
But, I can’t help but think about 
what would be the case if we weren’t 
family. If we were simply family 
friends instead, would we feel the 
same way about each other? Would 
we keep trying to talk our way 
through broken speech? I think not. 

My experience communicating 

with my grandparents is unique and 
gratifying in some ways, yet it seems 
wholly unfavorable in others. When 
I see my friends on the phone with 
their grandparents, chatting away 
as if they were any other family 
member or friend, I feel a sting 
of envy. 

There 
is 
some 

resentment within my 
own family as well. My 
older 
brother 
grew 

up speaking Telugu, 
allowing him to fluently 
talk to family members 
with ease. While 
he feels a sense of 
comfort at family 

gatherings, I often feel like an alien. 
Seeing him effortlessly converse 
with family and family friends 
makes me feel a constant sense of 
inferiority. 

People always tell me: “There’s 

so much time to learn!” “If you go 
to India you’ll pick up Telugu in no 
time!” And, yes — this is true that 
my Telugu improves when I am 
constantly surrounded by family. 
But, it is simply too difficult to fully 
learn a language after I have already 
been trying — and failing — for the 
past 18 years. 

And, when I would try to speak 

in Telugu during family functions, I 
would be ridiculed for my American 
accent and choppy sentences. All the 
while, my family and family friends 
would praise my brother for his 
charisma and speaking skills. The 
more I tried to speak Telugu, the 
more I was mocked for it — causing 
me to speak less frequently and lose 
what little Telugu skills I did have. 
Now I inadvertently present myself 
as aloof and disinterested during 
large family gatherings, which is 
something I wish to change.

I 
repeatedly 
asked 

my parents for some 
explanation as to why 
they never taught me 
Telugu like they had 
for 
my 

brother. The answer was always 
the same: My brother had a hard 
time finding friends in preschool 
and early elementary school due to 
his limited English abilities, and my 
parents didn’t want me to struggle 
in the same way. So, they taught 
me English as my first language; 
but, once I started effectively and 
comfortably communicating with 
my parents in English, there was no 
longer a sense of urgency to learn 
Telugu.

I always felt that I would have 

rather struggled socially as a toddler 
than be unable to speak to my own 
family now. But, rather than assume 
the offensive, I know that I must also 
be sympathetic toward my parents. 
As Indian immigrants, it is difficult 
enough for them to navigate the 
extent to which they assimilate into 
their new culture. This difficulty is 
compounded when one has 
to decide how to raise 
their children, teetering 
the 
line 

between one’s home culture and the 
culture they’ve immigrated to. 

As a first generation American, 

I often think about how my own 
children will teeter this line. 
Truthfully, they will have no need 
for me to pass down the language 
skills of Telugu; the only people 
in my family who cannot speak 
English are older members. They 
will never have to struggle through 
painful, choppy conversations with 
their own family. For that I am both 
glad and envious.

So 
no, 
movies 
like 
“Love 

Actually” are wrong in their 
depictions of a communication-less 
love as being fun, fresh and simple. 
This type of love is anything but. 

When spring comes

When spring comes, everything 

will be easier, I tell myself. When the 
sidewalks are again crowded with 
the overhang of returning leaves, 
I won’t dread the walk to class, 
heading north on State Street and 
navigating through the intersection 
that smells permanently, but also 
sort of deliciously, of pizza and 
cigarettes. When I am eating 
breakfast to the chorus of birdsong, 
I won’t be so irritable, my coffee will 
taste better. Maybe, I tell myself, 
maybe I’ll finally stop needing to 
drink coffee. 

I wish I could say that I know by 

now not to fall for this plot every 
year. But after an especially long 
winter, I’m willing to believe almost 
anything. Spring, as a concept, is 
hope itself. 

We’ve all read — or were forced 

to read by a surprisingly passionate 
high school teacher — “How to 
Read Literature Like a Professor” 
by Thomas C. Foster. Didactic, a bit 
patronizing, the book lends insights 
such as these: “For about as long as 
anyone’s been writing anything, 
the seasons have stood for the same 
set of meanings: spring; childhood 
and youth, summer; fulfillment and 
passion, autumn; decline, middle-
age and tiredness, but also harvest, 
winter; old age, resentment and 
death.” Foster continues, “We know 

these patterns because they’ve been 
with us for so long. How long? Very 
long.”

I’ll lay this winter’s problem out 

flat: if left undisturbed, I can and 
will sleep into the deep afternoon. 
Most mornings I find it near 
impossible to wake up — worse yet is 
when I’ve had the requisite amount 
of hours needed (seven, it’s been 
said), but with a determination that I 
can only describe as self-preserving, 
I angrily switch all of the alarms 
off as they ring, each one its own 
annoyingly unique sound: Bulletin. 
Sencha. Marimba.

If I need to get up at, say, 7 a.m., 

I will set the first alarm for 6 a.m. 
I will then set at least 6 more, in 
intervals of 10 minutes, leading up 
to 7 a.m. It by no means ends there: I 
will set about five more past the top 
of that hour to ensure that I get up. 
And it’s usually the very last alarm 
that does it. To put it simply: If I 
need to get up at 7 a.m., I will get up 
at 7:30 a.m., and it will take at least 
20 alarms.

Rollaway alarm clocks, light 

therapy, melatonin tabs taken at 
strategic hours; there are many 
such solutions to the problem(s) I’m 
describing here. Healthline says 
there are various reasons one could 
always be tired: nutrient deficiencies 
(of which it could be iron, riboflavin, 
niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, 
folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, 
vitamin C or magnesium), stress, 

“certain” medical conditions, dietary 
imbalances, too much caffeine, 
inadequate 
hydration, 
obesity, 

“certain” medications. I’m drudging 
through a sea of ambiguous and 
thoroughly 
unhelpful 
medical 

knowledge. So now what?

It’s April, winter’s ugly last leg, 

and I’m still as exhausted as I was 
when this season started. The 
skies overhead are a dull gray, even 
duller, it seems, than gray ordinarily 
is — nothing promising ahead 
except lunch. I loll my head back 
existentially. Everybody I know 
and like is abroad. I can’t stand the 
sympathy theater that professors 
put on during this season: “I know, 
it’s that time of year, but hey — listen 
— I’ll let you out five minutes early. 
How’s that?” Oh, the gratitude I 
force myself to feel as I step out onto 
a marsh that yesterday was a snow-
covered Diag. 

And I don’t particularly care 

to hear about truth-functional

As a Christian, my favorite verse in 

the Bible is Mark 9:24. “Immediately the 
father of the child cried out and said, ‘I 
believe; help my unbelief!’”

This is my unbelief:
My 
name 
is 
Sarah 
Olumayowa 

Olamide Oguntomilade. I come from a 
Christian, Nigerian family where names 
are very important. It is believed that 
when you call someone’s name, you are 
declaring or prophesying something 
about them, because the words we say 
have power. Because of this, my parents 
gave me the biblical name of Sarah:, a 
woman whose womb was blessed by God, 
a name that means princess. I believe 
that my love for children and my desire 
to be a children’s educator was derived 
from this name, while my parents argue 
that my love for the finer things in life 
was brought about by them naming me 
princess. My two middle names are 
in Yoruba, the language spoken in my 
home and amongst millions of people in 
Nigeria and other parts of West Africa. 
Olumayowa and Olamide. Olumayowa 
meaning “God Brings Joy” and Olamide 
meaning “My Wealth Has Arrived.” You 
see, these aren’t just names found in a 
BuzzFeed article or in a book of a hun-
dred cute names for girls. My parents 
truly believed that by naming me this, 

they were telling God the desires of their 
hearts. Every time they call my name, 
it’s a prayer. A prayer for joy and wealth 
to enter their household. I wonder how 
good God’s Yoruba is?. 

My last name comes from a bit of a dif-

ferent place. It was not one chosen but 
rather given, a name that has conquered 
the test of time. You see, before the mis-
sionaries arrived at Cape of Good Hope, 
before the Portuguese arrived in West-
ern Africa, before Great Britain drew the 
lines of Nigeria at the Berlin conference, 
the Yoruba people believed in a series 
of gods. The god of war, Ogun, is one of 
them, hence my last name: Oguntomi-
lade. A last name that has almost been 
changed a good number of times because 
“we no longer subscribe to those beliefs” 
and “we don’t want people to think we 
are violent people who enjoy war or 
revenge.” 

Nonetheless, my name is Sarah Olu-

mayowa Olamide Oguntomilade.

The first prayer that I learned was a 

classic. “Our Father who art in heaven, 
hallowed be thy name.” My little pre-
school mind struggled to understand 
how I had a father in heaven when my 
dad was the one to drop me off at Sunday 
school that day. Regardless, every day 
after that, one could hear me pray, “Our 
Father who art in heaven, hallowed be 
thy name.” 

In 2015, I moved to the beautiful city 

of Maputo, Mozambique. Now on the 

southern shore of Africa, a former Portu-
guese colony, I marveled at the number 
of women I met while working with the 
United States Agency for International 
Development, who mainly spoke their 
native tongue of Xangana. Yet what they 
could say in Portuguese was the Lord’s 
Prayer. Pai Nosso que estais no céu, San-
 I wondered 
how good God’s Xangana was?. 

Two years ago, my mom sent me 

an article via WhatsApp (the home of 
facts true and untrue) titled “Yoruba is 
now an official language in Brazil and 
can be taught in schools!.” The article 
described how there are enough descen-
dants of West African slaves in Brazil 
who retained their maternal tongue of 
Yoruba that it can now be considered 
one of their official languages. “How 
cool is that?” my mother says. While I 
understood her amusement towards the 
idea that she could communicate with 
a significant number of people in Bra-
zil in her mother tongue, I struggled to 
find the “coolness” in this fact. I began 
to wonder what it sounded like when my 
people were on the ships on their way to 
Brazil and Southern America. Did they 
sing: 



Aribiti

Arabata


Oluwa

(God you are the most high. God you 

are the most high. You see near and far, 
God you are the most high.) 

I wonder if God heard their cry. I won-

der if God would have understood it bet-
ter in Portuguese. As I wondered, I began 

to wander in my studies and I found 
myself in a class last semester entitled 
“History of the Spanish and Portuguese 
Speaking World.” I began to contemplate 
how good God’s Nahuatl, Quechua or 
Taino was. I began to contemplate how 
good God’s Yoruba, Twi, Igbo or Creole 
was. Perhaps the god of war would’ve 
been more beneficial to them. Perhaps 
the god of war would’ve avenged them. 
Perhaps the god of war would’ve under-
stood their cries. 

My 
name 
is 
Sarah 
Olumayowa 

Olamide Oguntomilade. 

I rejoiced on the evening of Friday, 

Feb. 26 — I could finally escape the 
clutches of my unfinished assignments 
and email drafts by basking in the light 
of 11 glorious letters: Spring Break.

After 
struggling 
through 
two 

months with a “just get through this 
week” mindset, I was more than ready 
to kick back and relax for a week. Dur-
ing break, I woke up at noon, answered 
some texts and then went back to sleep 
for a few more hours. After finally get-
ting out of bed, I would eat a late lunch 
before watching some Netflix or aim-
lessly going through the same three 
apps on my phone. I saw a few friends 

who were still in town, but I spent the 
majority of the week staring at a small, 
glowing screen while hugging my old 
Hello Kitty plushie in bed.

I had made plans for this highly 

anticipated week: I was supposed to 

dust off my cello and give Dvoák’s 
Cello Concerto in B Minor a quick 
whirl, open the piano at home and 
practice some Jay Chou and dig around 
my closet for some acrylic paints to 
mess around with. But the first day of 
break was for de-stressing, and so was 
the second, the third . . . until break 
had melted away like the snow. 

I wish I could say the week did me a 

lot of good and that it was nice to rest 
so much, but the reality was that for an 
entire week, what I had intended to be 
a well-spent vacation had turned into 
an extended depressive episode. The 
worst part was that after prolonged 
fatigue from months of work, not 
only was I unable to truly relax, but I 
allowed myself to dismiss the ways my 
depression had wreaked havoc, instead 
opting for avoidant efforts of “taking a 
break” under the guise of “practicing 
self-care.” 

I had given myself a week to fix 

my problems — to “solve” my mental 
health issues, restoring it to a condi-
tion just good enough to last me the 
rest of the term. I had somehow duped 
myself into believing that a week would 
be enough to placate my depression 
for the remaining month and a half 
of school, despite the fact that it had 
plagued me for a decade. At the end of 
spring break, when I was supposed to 
check Gmail and Canvas in order to 
make my transition to the latter half 
of the term easier, I instead did what 
I had done for the other eight days of 
spring break — absolutely nothing. 

As a result, the first Monday back 

from break was agonizing. I skipped 
my classes, unable to find the energy 
to get out of bed, and forced myself to 
nap and try to forget about the assign-
ments I still hadn’t completed — or 
even started — yet. When I couldn’t 
fall back asleep, I laid in bed and 
mourned the time I had dedicated to 
rest and recovery, which had instead 
been wasted.

But it’s alright, I would think. I can 

chug through this term. I did it every 
other term, so why not this one too, 
right? 

The rest of my first week back from 

break consisted of me hardly eating 
a meal a day, continuing to skip most 
of my classes and randomly bailing on 
plans with friends in order to stay in 
my room for the rest of the week. As 

the days went by, my self-destructive 
habits made me realize how burnt out 
and depressed I was — how the “rest” 
that I had taken over the previous week 
had not been true rest or self-care. 
By never prioritizing self-care and 
always putting every other responsi-
bility first, I had never gotten around 
to taking care of myself. As I had put 
aside this ‘task’ of self-care further 
and further until spring break, it was 
only until after the break ended that I 
realized self-care can’t and shouldn’t 
be an isolated event. Rather, it must be 
something that I constantly integrate 
into my life every day.

When I had skipped enough classes, 

I decided to start with reaching out to 

professors after checking the printed 
syllabi in my folders. It was like an 
apology tour, except my set list con-
sisted of songs like, “I Apologize for 
My Recent Absences,” “Would It Be 
All Right to Receive an Extension” and 
of course, the number-one hit single 
“Thank You So Much for Your Under-
standing.” Writing the emails took 
time, too — it wasn’t that writing them 

was difficult, but that I had to first set 
aside the feeling that I was no longer 
a good student and that my professors 
were disappointed in me.

I won’t lie: a few of them were. Read-

ing their responses and immediately 
picking up on their disappointed tones 
made me feel like my heart was getting 
steamrolled, but at the same time, I 
knew it meant that I had at least made 
small progress. On the other hand, 
when professors expressed empathy 
and extended kindness to me, I felt 
almost empowered to return to class. 
Knowing that they were at least aware 
(or at best, understanding and com-
passionate) of why I had been a com-
pletely different student than I was 

at the beginning of the term made the 
prospect of going to class easier — I felt 
like I no longer had to hide. Despite 
spring break having ended several 
days before, after emailing my profes-
sors and then going to class, the burn-
ing feeling of shame from missing class 
had eased up a bit. Simply being in the 
classroom helped me feel more like a 
student than I had in weeks, and going 
back to class started to help me with 
the other parts of my life as I started 
to get back into a routine. 

Now, at the end of March, I am still 

catching up on assignments. I am still 
finding the need to go back to play my 
professors a few of my old hit songs, 
and there are still days where I am 
unable to get out of bed. On these 
days, I think of my stomach growling 
over spring break because I couldn’t 
find the energy to grab a bite to eat, 
or the agony of having to send my pro-
fessors another slew of emails about 
my mental health while determining 
where the line between honesty and 
trauma dumping is. While stewing in 
my agony, I hug my faded Hello Kitty 
plushie, let my steamrolled heart ache 
a bit and swallow back the nausea I had 
felt from the shame of walking into a 
classroom I hadn’t seen in a month. 

Now though, while I process the 

nausea, I roll around in bed and let 
myself answer a few texts before forc-
ing myself to at least sit at my desk. I 
sit there, staring vacantly at the wall 
for a good 10 seconds before slowly 
opening my laptop. I open Gmail and 
log into Canvas before starting to 
write a to-do list. Even if I only fin-
ish one assignment or even if all I do 
is sort through my emails, I know it is 
better than staring listlessly in bed for 
hours. Sitting at my desk is enough of 
an accomplishment for me, and even 
though getting out of bed doesn’t mean 
my GPA will go up, it means that I have 
at least taken one more step in actually 
taking care of myself.

My name is

Self-sabotage over spring break

What Trotter means to us

 SARAH OGUNTOMILADE


 YUNSEO CHO


Special thanks to Karla Bell, Suba (His-


The William Trotter Multicultur-

al Center recently celebrated its 50th 
anniversary in February and with each 
passing milestone, there comes an even 
greater need to preserve the history and 
purpose of this building so we do not lose 
sight of the communities Trotter is sup-
posed to serve. To learn more about Trot-
ter’s history and its significance to Black 
students at the University of Michigan, 
I had the opportunity to sit down with 
Business senior Karla Bell, who serves as 
the Suba (Historian) on the Black Student 
Union 2021-2022 Executive Board. 

Trotter was originally called Trotter 

House and was colloquially known as the 
“Black House” amongst Black students. 
Directly resulting from the actions of 
the first (of three) Black Action Move-
ments, Trotter House was built in 1971 as 
a Black Student Cultural Center to meet 
the needs of Black students on campus. 
When talking about the early beginnings 
of Trotter, Bell said, “Black students real-
ly only had Trotter, and it was neither in 
a safe location on campus nor well fund-
ed. Trotter was funded and built at the 
hands of student labor.” 

Trotter House was the host building 

for events for Black students, but they 
had to risk their safety to be able to use 
the space. Bell said, “At the time, Black 
people on campus were susceptible to 
violence and danger because (Trotter 
House) was off-campus in a poorly lit 

area. Yet still, they risked their wellbe-
ing to be there.” In 1972, the original 
Trotter House burned down in a kitchen 
fire so the University bought a build-
ing on Washtenaw Avenue to house the 

student center. By 1981, Trotter House 
would expand its scope to become a mul-
ticultural student center. As the Trotter 
House expanded to include program-
ming for students of all racial minorities 
on campus, Black Student Union execu-
tive board members tried to appeal for 

increased funding from the University to 
expand their efforts in promoting equity 
on campus.

In 2013, undergraduate and graduate 

students began “A New Trotter Initia-

tive,” a plan to have a new multicultural 
center be built at the center of campus. 
After three years of advocating to the 
University of Michigan administration 
for a new building, a $10 million bud-
get was finally approved in 2016 for the 
building of The William Trotter Multi-
cultural Center. By 2019, Trotter had offi-
cially found a new home on South State 
Street and was open for student use. 

Currently, less than 4% of the U-M 

undergraduate population is Black, mak-
ing it easy to feel like an outsider in most 
spaces on campus. Because of this, Trot-
ter is an essential space for Black stu-
dents. It exists as our place to congregate; 
it’s one of the only buildings on campus 
that feels as though it belongs to Black 
students — a home base of sorts where we 
can build fellowship, work together and 
exist in the comfort of our own communi-
ty. This is why Trotter is frequently used 
by organizations like BSU and HEADS 
(Here Earning A Destiny through Hon-
esty, Eagerness, And Determination of 
Self) to hold their meetings. Students of 
Color, and specifically Black students, 
commonly frequent the multicultural 
center, which speaks to its necessity in 
the community. 

For me personally, I find myself in 

Trotter after a day of classes more often 
than not. I always know I’ll run into at 
least a few of my friends every time I step 

into the building. Between homework 
assignments, I’ll usually take a break 
from my work to make conversation with 
them and joke around. If I’m not doing 
homework or hanging out with friends, 
then usually I’m somehow finding my 
way into the activities that might be 
going on in Trotter that day, like a game 
night or a cultural event. There is such an 
intrinsic sense of community in Trotter, 
which makes it unlike any other building 
on campus. 

“If you’re coming into Trotter, learn 

the history of the space and respect the 
effort that it took to have this,” Bell said. 
“(Black) students lost their scholarships 
for this and faced consequences to have 
Trotter as a space.” Everyone who comes 
into Trotter, whether it be for personal 
use or for an organization, should be 
mindful that such a space came direct-
ly from Black activism. There is a rich 
history behind how Trotter has trans-
formed into the multicultural center that 
we know it as today and this history is 
intertwined with the Black Action Move-
ments.

I’m grateful to the Black students who 

fought to have a building like Trotter on 
campus and as we use the space to build 
fellowship amongst underrepresented 
groups on campus, it’s imperative that 
we continue to pass down the history as 
well.

A

s war rages in Ukraine, 
inflation 
skyrockets 
to 

unprecedented 
highs 

and businesses brace for possible 
cyberattacks, 
Republicans 
and 

Democrats alike have their work 
cut out for them. While solutions 
to these issues remain elusive, 
Congress has been able to take 
action on a seemingly less urgent 
topic: daylight saving time. In a rare 
show of bipartisanship, the Senate 
unanimously passed the Sunshine 
Protection Act. If signed into law 
by the House of Representatives 
and President Biden, the bill would 
permanently 
move 
the 
entire 

country (except for Arizona and 
Hawaii) to Daylight Saving Time 
(DST) and do away with the four-
month annual period of Standard 
Time that moves clocks one hour 
earlier from November to March.

The Sunshine Protection Act, 

sponsored by Sen. Marco Rubio, 
R-Fla., has obvious appeal. It would 
end the decades-long custom of 
“springing forward” every March 
and “falling back” every November. 
This practice, which is disruptive 
to sleep schedules and may even be 
bad for our health, forces people to 
groggily adjust their internal clocks 
twice a year. 

The bill, as its name suggests, 

would also “protect” the country’s 
sunshine by delivering another hour 
of daylight every afternoon during 
the fall and winter months. On Dec. 
21, 2021 — the shortest day of the 
last calendar year — the sun set in 
Ann Arbor at 5:05 p.m., before most 
people usually eat dinner. Night fell 
over New York and Chicago even 
earlier, by around 4:30 p.m. Under 
the Sunshine Protection Act, sunset 
would have come a full hour later, 
giving people more daylight in the 
evening for outdoor activities and 
commuting home from work or 
classes. 

But the Sunshine Protection Act 

isn’t all good. The bill has a dark 
side that most people either don’t 
understand or fail to acknowledge. 
Despite its broad support, passing 
this bill into law isn’t in the best 
interest of the American people. 
The Senate has jumped the gun on 
protecting our sunshine without 
weighing the massive drawbacks 
such a move would entail.

What’s the problem with the 

Sunshine Protection Act? First 
and foremost, its supporters only 
tell half of the story. While the sun 
would set an hour later every day 
between November and March 
(when we revert to Standard Time 
under current law), the Sunshine 
Protection Act wouldn’t actually 
protect our sunshine at all. It would 
merely shift our daylight from the 
morning to the evening, effectively 
pushing the sunrise each morning 
an hour later. Later sunrises might 
not seem like a huge problem at first. 
But a closer look at the impacts of one 
hour less of sunlight every morning 
reveals deep problems with this bill 
that should have prevented it from 
passing in the Senate.

Instead of rising on Dec. 21 at 

8:00 a.m. here in Ann Arbor, the 
Sunshine Protection Act would’ve 
pushed sunrise to a startling 9:00 
a.m. For a student or worker here 
who wakes up at a traditional time 
like 7:00 A.M. they’d be greeted 
by two full hours of complete 
darkness before the sun comes up. 
The problem is exacerbated for 
communities located on the western 
edges of their respective time 
zones. In Marquette, in Michigan’s 
Upper Peninsula, sunrise on Dec. 
21 wouldn’t have come until 9:30 
a.m. Some communities in western 
North Dakota, which is located in 
the Central Time Zone, wouldn’t see 
daylight until almost 10:00 a.m.

Rather than protect sunlight, the 

Sunshine Protection Act guarantees 
that people near the western edges of 
their time zones around the country 
wake up every day in darkness. 
This 
isn’t 
just 
irritating 
and 

inconvenient for the people in these 
areas who wake up at a reasonable 
hour. It’s deeply problematic for 
the health and safety of society. 
Perhaps the group that will be most 
disadvantaged by the Sunshine 
Protection Act is students. School 
starts at 8:00 a.m. at the average 
public high school, and many schools 
start even earlier. Proponents of 
the Sunshine Protection Act cite 
the benefits of universal DST for 
students, such as the added daylight 
in the afternoon for after-school 
sports and extracurriculars. But 
these benefits are unclear since most 
activities are already held indoors 
during the winter months outside 
of some southern states like Florida 
where the weather is warm enough 
for them to be held outside. 

Even if a successful case can be 

made for the health benefits of the 
additional afternoon sunlight, these 
benefits are far outweighed by the 
safety hazards students would face 
every morning walking to school 
or waiting at the bus stop in total 
darkness. We need not look far back 
in history to see that this bill would 
put students in harm’s way on a 
daily basis. In the 1970s, America 
tried the same thing proposed 
in the Sunshine Protection Act, 
and the results were disastrous. 
Children heading to school were, on 
numerous occasions, struck by cars 
on dark winter mornings, resulting 
in injuries and deaths. In Florida 
alone, eight children were killed 
in accidents soon after the change 
took effect. Between December 1973 
and February 1974, public support 
for the nationwide experiment 
nearly dropped by half, from 79% 
to 42%, leading Congress to repeal 
the measure and return the clocks 
to normal. Fast forward 50 years, 
there’s no reason to believe anything 
will be different the second time 
around. 

While 
students 
would 
face 

unacceptable 
risks 
under 
this 

proposal, they’re far from the 
sole group affected. A growing 
number of experts are sounding 
the alarm over the health impacts 
of permanent DST for people of all 
ages and backgrounds. The current 
practice of “falling back” and 
“springing forward” is already bad 
for our health, but doctors argue the 
Sunshine Protection Act would make 
matters even worse. Researchers 
say permanent DST could lead 
to “a more sustained negative 
health impact” and greater risks 
of cancer as well as metabolic and 
cardiovascular disorders, according 
to the Wall Street Journal. If one of 
the primary aims of universal DST 
is eliminating the dreaded biannual 
time change, it’s unclear why the 
Senate hasn’t considered permanent 
Standard Time instead. This option 
hasn’t received enough attention and 
deserves serious consideration.

Ultimately, daylight saving time 

may have some benefits, but the 
drawbacks of switching to DST 
permanently 
are 
overwhelming 

and clear. Before the Sunshine 
Protection Act becomes law, it’s 
critical our lawmakers pump the 
brakes on this legislation and weigh 
the real costs of transforming how 
we keep time.

Here’s why we should pump the brakes 

on universal Daylight Saving Time

T

here is a lot of fiction to 
the NBC comedy The 
Good Place. If you are 

unaware of the plot of the show, 
it is essentially a testimony to 
one theory of what happens 
after we pass. The show begins 
with 
the 
main 
character, 

Eleanor Shellstrop, believing 
she has reached “The Good 
Place” (i.e. heaven) by mistake, 
and in a desperate attempt to fit 
in, she asks an ethics professor 
named Chidi Anagonye to teach 
her how to be good. Though 
there are a lot of humorous 
aspects and storybook elements 
to the show, one aspect of it that 
I thought was pretty realistic 
was the emphasis on people’s 
capacity to change. 

Perhaps you feel a television 

show is not a good testament 
to real life, and I completely 
agree. But watching Eleanor 
over time grow to be a morally 
better person still made me 
think about the way our society 
is structured. Is it impossible 
to teach people how to be a 
good person? If we spend years 
learning math, science, history, 
English, etc. in school, then 
why can’t we spend a little more 
time learning about morals? 

Thinking 
about 
this 

concept led me to do some 
self-reflecting. When did I 
learn the difference between 
good and bad or what doing 
the right thing even means? 
I certainly was never given 
a 
PowerPoint 
presentation 

describing different scenarios 
and testing me on what the 
“right thing to do” was, so 
when 
were 
those 
values 

instilled in me? Personally I 
think it has a lot to do with how 
we are raised. In the debate of 
nature versus nurture, studies 
of genetic twins have shown 
that anywhere from a quarter 
to a half of our tendency to be 
giving and caring is inherited; 

that still leaves a lot of the 
responsibility 
on 
nurture. 

Some studies attribute it to 
the parents’ or legal guardian’s 
sense of empathy and injustice, 
while others believe it has to do 
more with modeling and how 
the guardians act and respond 
to certain situations. On the 
other side, there are those who 
don’t believe the responsibility 
lies on the parents at all and 
that some kids are just simply 
bad seeds.

Whichever 
theory 
you 

believe, it is hard to dispute that 
to some extent, what you learn 
as a child definitely plays a part 
in your morality. So doesn’t it 
follow that if your immediate 
environment 
doesn’t 
teach 

you those important things 
there is the potential to learn it 
elsewhere? 

This question of whether 

teaching 
ethics 
would 
be 

effective at achieving any good is 
one that I have grappled with for 
quite some time. This is also the 
exact question a Stanford Panel 
sought to answer. Reading about 
their debates within the panel, 
it became clear that there are 
definite benefits but also valid 
reasons to be cautious about 
teaching ethics to kids. For one, 
many scholars participating in 
the panel “expressed discomfort 
with the idea that they have 
any moral authority over their 
students.” 
The 
professors’ 

perspective is that they are in 
no position to tell their students 
what is morally virtuous and 
what is not as it would imply 
that they are on some higher 
moral ground when in reality, 
many view their students as just 
as virtuous, if not more virtuous, 
than them. Therefore, to have 
that control over their behavior 
is seen as an abuse of power that 
many dislike. Moreover, it is 
definitely difficult to understand 
how one college course has the 
power to magically transform 
students into a more virtuous 
version of themselves in only 
one semester. But, in the end, I 

would argue that making ethics 
a mandatory class could only 
positively benefit students.

From that same panel, many 

of the professors agreed that 
such classes help teach students 
how 
to 
engage 
in 
ethical 

dialogue, assist in widening 
their tolerance and create a 
space where they can talk about 
their 
moral 
disagreements. 

And through such discussions, 
the Stanford professors admit 
that the impact on students 
can 
be 
huge: 
including 

helping 
them 
understand 

more about themselves while 
also improving their critical 
thinking skills and academic 
performances. Again, though 
the chances of one throwing 
their previously held mindset 
out the window after one ethics 
class is unlikely, opening up the 
floor for such conversations has 
the power to broaden peoples’ 
minds. 
Linda 
Flanagan, 
an 

advisory board member for 
the Ethics Institute at Kent 
Place School has said that by 
posing students with ethical 
dilemmas they must reflect 
on, it forces them to answer 
tough questions and as a result 
adapt better ethical decision 
making. In the process, by being 
forced to explore an issue from 
different sides — as Flanagan 
encourages kids to do — it also 
works to help kids understand 
and become more empathetic 
toward others as well. Such 
evidence 
shows 
that 
while 

ethics can be a hard topic to 
address, if done correctly it can 
be very beneficial and effective 
in shaping people’s minds.

If 
you 
are 
still 
feeling 

doubtful, I will end by leaving 
you with a simple question: to 
some extent, people are just the 
products of their environments. 
And so doesn’t it stand to 
reason that if we force people 
out of their comfort zone, away 
from the mindsets they are 
used to, and make them engage 
with new perspectives, a new 
product might emerge?

C

ome to the back room, girls, 
I’ll show you around.”

Right away, his words 

set off a thousand different alarm 
bells in my head. My gut is telling 
me to get out, but he’s holding the 
ice cream we just ordered, and we 
can’t really leave without looking 
crazy, or possibly offending him. He 
keeps talking, asking us questions 
about where we go to school, how 
old we are and what our plans are for 
today. I make eye contact with my 
friend, praying she picks up on my 
panic. Thankfully, she does, and we 
manage to pay and leave without a 
problem. Still, I’m shaken up. 

Every woman on this campus 

can probably think of a situation 
bearing some similarity to that one. 
When a woman — or anyone female 
presenting — is out in public, there’s 
a lot they have to keep in mind: travel 
in groups, carry pepper spray, share 
your location with your friends and 
don’t leave your drink unattended, to 

name a few. The fear is omnipresent, 
a background hum in the music of 
our lives, and even if you check off all 
those boxes, the danger remains. Last 
March, 33-year-old Sarah Everard 
was raped and killed on her walk 
home in London. She was on the 
phone with her boyfriend, wearing 
bright clothing and walking in a well-
lit neighborhood. Not only was she 
familiar with her surroundings, but 
several people knew her whereabouts. 
Seemingly, she did everything right, 
but it wasn’t enough. 

Tragic cases like these make it 

hard not to assume the worst. As a 
woman, letting your guard down 
can have disastrous consequences. 
A recent study by anti-harassment 
organization 
Hollaback! 
and 

Cornell University showed that 
85% of women reported their first 
experience of harassment before 
the age of 17, and a shocking 12% 
reported harassment before the 
age of 11. Seventy-seven percent of 
women reported being followed at 
some point, and — perhaps most 
concerningly — half of U.S. women 
under the age of 40 reported being 
groped or fondled in public. 

These statistics speak volumes 

about the disturbing reality women 
face in places such as public transit, 
parks and college campuses. It’s 
not a choice. From a young age, we 
are forced to be wary of the men 
around us, and when incidents of 
harassment and assault do occur, 
the blame is often pinned on the 
woman herself. Questions like, 
“why didn’t she fight back?” or “why 
didn’t she say no?” get tossed around 
without ever actually addressing 
the problematic double standard at 
play. Women are socialized to fear 
strange men, yet are also expected to 
ignore this fear and be assertive and 
aggressive when targeted. 

By the time a woman has reached 

adolescence, she has most likely 
internalized one important fact: 
You 
should 
never 
intentionally 

make a man angry. Be polite and 
understanding, even when you feel 
unsafe, because you do not know how 
they will react. We avert eye contact 
with those catcalling us so as not to 
encourage them, and we certainly 
don’t holler back. We tell men who 
hit on us that we have a boyfriend, not 
that we’re just not attracted to them. 

When the man in the ice cream 

store began to make me feel 

uncomfortable, 
I 
found 
myself 

scrambling for a way to escape the 
situation without coming off as rude. 
Not a single part of me ever considered 
telling him off or storming out of the 
store, simply because I feared his 
reaction — and rightly so. Aggression 
can have violent consequences. Just 
recently in Detroit, 27-year-old Mary 
Spears was approached by a young 
man hoping to get her number. She 
rejected him several times before 
her fiancé intervened. The encounter 
eventually ended in a shootout that 
left Spears dead and five others 
wounded. 

These incidents are obviously 

rare. It is a minority of men who 
harass and assault women, let alone 
who commit murder. Still, these 
stories send a message to women 
everywhere 
about 
what 
could 

happen if they choose to stand up for 
themselves in the face of harassment. 
A Tumblr page entitled “When 
Women Refuse” is dedicated to 
sharing the stories of those who have 
faced violence after rejecting sexual 
advances. Take just one minute to 
scroll, and you’ll find story after story 
of harassment and assault directed 
at women who simply said no. How 

can women be expected to shrug 
off these advances if these are the 
possible consequences? 

Many want to chalk up women’s 

fear in public to sheer paranoia. Some 
even believe that women should 
take forms of sexual harassment 
like catcalling as a compliment. I 
mean, why be afraid? Most men are 
great, right? Except the ones that 
aren’t. A study from The National 
Coalition Against Domestic Violence 
found that one in three women have 
experienced abuse from an intimate 
partner, and that one in seven women 
have been stalked by an intimate 
partner to the point that they feared 
for their lives. If the people closest 
to these women are capable of that, 
why would wariness of absolute 
strangers be deemed paranoia? 

Maybe the man in the ice cream 

shop was harmless, but even if he 
was, I cannot say that I would react 
differently a second time around. 
Though it’s amusing to entertain 
the idea of telling him off, it is much 
more likely that my fear of the 
consequences would prevail, and 
the same is true for many women 
around the world. We are taught to 
pacify the men who are a threat to 

our safety because standing up for 
ourselves poses a greater risk than 
benefit. Women everywhere are 
forced to reconcile with the idea that 
when alone in public, some men — 
even if only just a fraction — view 
them as something to be objectified, 
and they must navigate the world 
accordingly. 

Our wariness isn’t a personal 

insult to all men, but instead a 
defense mechanism. All of society — 
men in particular — have the power 
to change this. Many do not realize 
that they are inadvertently making 
women feel unsafe, but there are 
things that can be done to prevent 
this: keep your distance, don’t 
flirt if the woman is not showing 
interest and recognize that their 
reserve is most likely not a reflection 
of you, but instead a reflection of 
their desperation to get home safe. 
Perhaps most importantly, teach 
boys and young men that women 
in public spaces are not public 
property, but instead people who 
are just trying to go about their day. 
Constantly living engulfed in a cloud 
of fear is exhausting, but together we 
can begin to ease this burden and 
make women everywhere feel safer.

Perhaps not all men, but certainly all women

E

veryone wants to be “that 
girl.” You know who she 
is, the one who “has her 

life together,” who wakes up early, 
works out in a chic set, drinks 
colorful smoothies, has pretty, 
shiny hair and glowing skin — all 
effortlessly of course. I’m sorry to 
tell you that this is not actually a 
tutorial on how to be her, in fact, 
I’m here to tell you instead that you 
can’t be her. She isn’t real! But you 
are, and you can be just as happy as 
her. 

Social media is full of trends: 

things that rapidly gain popularity 
and lose it just as quickly. It seems 
weekly, sometimes even more 
frequently, there is something 
new that we absolutely must try. 
Alarmingly, lifestyles have become 
part of these trends. The two 
are almost antonyms, making it 
unproductive to turn a lifestyle into 
a trend — or a trend into a lifestyle. 
Trends are fleeting, something that 
comes and goes almost too quickly 
to keep up with. A lifestyle, however, 
is something holistic, a way of living 
that influences everything one 
does, every day. A lifestyle cannot 
be adopted as quickly as or as 
fleetingly as trends are. 

Influencers all over social media 

masquerade as “that girl” for 
millions to see. Instagram is full 
of men and women alike carefully 
posing in their expensive gym 
outfits to show off their fit lifestyle. 
This is problematic as a second 
captured in time, with contorted 
angles, flattering lighting and 
subtle editing, is presented as 
a perpetual state of being. Tik 
Tokkers post 10-second videos of 
the best 10 seconds of their day, 
and YouTubers 10-minute videos 
of the best 10 minutes of their 
week. This is problematic because 

that’s all those videos are: their 
best moments represent their 
entire lifestyle. It sets unrealistic 
standards of not just how to look, 
act or be, but how to live. 

That isn’t real life. In reality, 

people struggle, and that’s okay. 
The lifestyle that is presented is 
not the problem, but the way in 
which people try to achieve it is. It 
is great to have goals of eating well, 
of taking care of your body through 
exercise, of maintaining a good 
schedule and other healthy things. 
However, it is important to realize 
that these types of significant 
changes don’t happen overnight 
and that it is not realistic to 
maintain such a “perfect” lifestyle 
all of the time. 

I might have misled you a bit. 

While I can’t tell you how to be “that 
girl,” I can help you to implement 
the lifestyle characteristics that 
she represents — with science. 
Leading a stable lifestyle is all 
about forming consistent habits. 
In “Atomic Habits” by James 
Clear, he notes that “your habits 
can compound for or against you.” 
He explains that productivity 
compounds, but so does stress. 
Completing one small task a day, 
for multiple days will result in lots 
of things accomplished. However, 
the opposite is also true. Multiple 
stressors can come together to 
create 
high-stress 
situations. 

If these situations persist for 
weeks, months or even years, 
they can create serious health and 
happiness problems. 

Knowledge and relationships 

can compound as well, but so can 
negative thoughts and anger. What 
all of this means is that everything 
you do must be done intentionally. 
Habits are most successful when 
there is some level of commitment 
behind them. Now, your situation 
is not going to change immediately 
because you decide it will — but 
over time it might. Practice the life 

you want, and it can become the 
life you have. 

This 
may 
all 
sound 
very 

exhausting, and honestly a lot of 
work. But, habit forming doesn’t 
have to be a burden. In “The Power 
of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, 
he describes the way habits are 
naturally formed. First, there is a 
cue, a desire for a result. Following 
that cue, a routine develops 
and finally, a result is obtained. 
The result is like a reward, it’s 
what was desired. This in turn 
provides subconscious motivation 
to repeat the routine or habit to 
continue getting the result or 
reward. Studies have found that 
it is the reward part that makes 
us continue the habit. If you are 
struggling to form a habit, you 
can accelerate this process a bit by 
rewarding yourself for completing 
the behavior you are trying to turn 
into a habit. 

For example, if you want to 

start waking up earlier, you might 
reward yourself with your favorite 
coffee or breakfast. This teaches 
your brain that waking up earlier 
results in something yummy. If 
you want to start studying for an 
hour each day, you could reward 
yourself with some television 
time afterward. I like to reward 
myself for cleaning my apartment 
with fresh flowers to put in the 
kitchen. If the result is sufficiently 
rewarding, the habit will form. 
While not perfect, habits are 
consistent and will deliver results. 
This can make change much easier 
and less of a chore. 

Being “that girl” is unattainable 

because it suggests that people live 
incredibly productive, healthy and 
well-balanced lives effortlessly. 
The truth is that none of those 
things are effortless. They require 
commitment, 
dedication 
and 

persistence, but they are achievable 
with good habits. If you start today, 
you can be anything you want.

T

erm limits on members 
of Congress have turned 
into one of the mainstay 

bipartisan policy appeals. Polls 
have shown as much as 80% of the 
country supports them. Politicians 
ranging from former President 
Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, 
R-Texas, to former President Barack 
Obama and progressive Rep. Ro 
Khanna, D-Calif. have backed the 
policy. Proponents of the idea like 
the 
aforementioned 
politicians 

suggest that they could improve 
our democratic system by rooting 
out 
corruption, 
modernizing 

Congress and implementing fresh 
leadership. 
Younger 
candidates 

for the upcoming November 2022 
midterms especially have clung to 
the idea, such as Iowa Democratic 
Senate candidate Abby Finkenauer, 
who has made term limits a main 
component of her campaign, likely 
in a direct attempt to attack veteran 
Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, 
who is currently running for his 
eighth term in the Senate. 

However, 
congressional 
term 

limits are not as great as they may 
seem. Foremost is the fact that they 
are inherently undemocratic, and 
go against much of what American 

democracy stands for. A core ideal 
of democracy is that those who are 
elected are a reflection of the will of 
the people. If a majority of a district 
or state wants someone elected, 
voters can reflect that preference on 
the ballot and elect them. 

Congressional term limits would 

take this all away. A congressperson 
could have done fantastic work for 
a district or state, be immensely 
popular and have a constituent base 
ready to support their re-election, 
only for the government to turn 
around and tell said constituents 
their candidate of choice is no longer 
valid. It makes little sense. While 
proponents of term limits decry a 
lack of new leadership, a cohort of 
extraordinarily old individuals and 
entrenched politicians, they fail to 
mention that there is a perfectly 
functional mechanism to rectify 
these issues, if indeed they fail to 
represent the majority of constituents, 
and that is for them to be voted out. 
Whether in office for three, 10 or 50 
years, every congressperson is held to 
the same standard of re-election: win 
the most votes. 

Additional problems include the 

fact that term limits, when they 
have been tried in state legislatures, 
have been shown to increase 
polarization, decrease familiarity 
between 
congresspeople 
— 

therefore hurting the chance to form 

bipartisan working relationships 
— and that legislative branches 
grow increasingly powerless in 
comparison to the executive brand 
and their underlying bureaucrats.

There is no reason to believe that 

new candidates would be any less 
corrupt, have any better intentions or 
be any better leaders than those who 
have steady, proven support among 
those they represent. This is the 
most popular reasoning invoked by 
proponents of term limits, yet there 
is little if any congruent evidence this 
policy would work as desired. Many 
term-limited members of Congress 
would simply go into occupations 
that cause the same problem most 
proponents are concerned about, 
such as political lobbying and 
advocating for shady special interests. 

It has become popular as of late, 

spurred on in part by prominent 
republicans, to critique experience. 
Somehow 
having 
extensive 

knowledge and familiarity with 
government has become a bad 
thing, and being an ‘outsider’ 
with little if any government or 
political experience has become 
desirable. While in almost every 
professional field experience is 
looked at as a benefit, for politicians 
it has become somehow an inherent 
evil. Moreover, were politicians to 
be limited to shorter terms, they 
would be less effective at crafting 

legislation 
and 
struggle 
more 

to navigate the complexities of 
congressional action.

A harsh reality of those in favor 

of term limits is that their support is 
often rooted in ageist thinking. Some 
feel that those who are, for example, 
75 years old and have been in 
Congress for decades no longer can 
be capable in their positions. While 
it is reasonable, and quite common, 
for individuals to prefer candidates 
based in part on their age, it is unfair 
and inaccurate to automatically 
surmise that those who are high 
in age are not competent or able 
enough to maintain their posture in 
Congress. Even if that were the case, 
there is a perfectly good system to 
remove these officeholders, through 
the democratic feature of voting.

Congressional term limits are 

a solution for a made-up issue and 
insult voters by insinuating that 
the electorate is not competent 
enough to hold its elected leaders 
accountable. Proponents of term 
limits exacerbate some of the exact 
issues they aim to rectify, and many 
of their ideas are often rooted in an 
immoral, ageist philosophy. While 
it is fair to be concerned about 
entrenched corruption and a lack of 
diverse generations in Congress, the 
solution is to elect better candidates, 
not take away the will of the people 
to vote as they please.

N

ecto, a club located on 
Liberty Street in Ann 
Arbor, 
is 
a 
popular 

destination for Queer students at the 
University of Michigan on Friday 
nights. This is partially to do with 
the 18 and up age requirement, and 
mostly to do with their infamous 
Pride Fridays, which have existed 
since 1984. Pride Friday (also known 
as “Gay Night”) sees high amounts 
of traffic — almost as soon as Necto 
opened back up in July 2021, there 
were lines down the sidewalk to get 
in. Clubs are popular on weekend 
nights, but Necto is particularly 
known around campus for Gay 
Night. 

During my freshman year, on Oct. 

3, 2019, my friends and I went to an 
Icona Pop concert at Necto (they 
wrote “I Love It (feat. Charli XCX)”, 
a very popular song from 2012). I 
dyed my hair temporarily pink and 
danced the entire night. A friend 
told me that one performer of the 
duo stared at me when they entered 
the crowd. I still don’t believe her. I 
did not go to Necto again until last 
semester when I went to a Friday 
Gay Night. While there was no 
official concert that I was waiting for 
and it was some random Friday night 
in October, the atmosphere held the 
same excitement and anticipation as 
I entered the club.

Many of my Queer friends still 

love to go on Fridays, even as they 
are over 21 and can go to other bars. 
One of Ann Arbor’s most popular 
gay bars, Aut Bar, closed during 
quarantine in June 2020. Drake 
George, a Statement columnist 
at The Michigan Daily, wrote in 
February about the decrease in 
Queer bars over the last few decades. 
Aut was not a singularity, and Necto 
stands today as one of the only 
18+ Queer-friendly bars within a 
walking distance for University of 
Michigan students. 

I sat down with Business freshman 

Maddie Wilson, a member of the 
executive board in the Out for 
Business organization at the Ross 
School of Business (though it is not 
Business 
School-exclusive). 
She 

estimated that she goes to Necto’s Gay 
Night almost every other Friday since 
joining the club, a popular event to 
bring members together. During our 
interview, she told me, “Personally I 
love Friday Pride Nights, just because 
it’s just a different atmosphere than 

a frat party.” She emphasized the 
community of Necto itself and the 
importance of going with people that 
you like, as well as her comfort going 
alone.

 For Wilson, Necto is not just a 

place to dance and listen to music 
with her friends, but also a place to 
meet people (we both have crazy 
bathroom stories). She said that she 
mainly goes on Fridays, but she tries 
to go on Saturdays with her sorority 
sisters, too. When I asked if she went 
anywhere other than Necto, she 
said, “I think Necto is the main place 
we go out … I don’t think there’s any 
other place, at least to my knowledge, 
that is a going-out club-type of feel, 
that has a Pride Night.”

I 
also 
asked 
Engineering 

junior Erdem Ozdemir about his 
experiences at Necto. He told me 
that he started going to Necto this 
past summer, but he has since 
been going more often, about once 
a month. When I asked about a 
favorite Necto memory, Ozdemir 
told me about an event two weeks 
ago — Kylie Sonique Love’s drag 
performance on Pride Friday. He 
expressed an interest in going to 
Live on their bi-weekly Thursday 
Pride nights after classes are over in 
the summer, but he currently only 
goes to Necto for specific Queer-
friendly events. “It also doesn’t help 
that there aren’t a ton of commercial 
Queer spaces in Ann Arbor, I know 
there was Aut Bar, but that closed 
over the pandemic,” Ozdemir said. 
“For now, it’s mostly Necto.” He told 
me that he only goes to Necto on Gay 
Night — “I’m usually there because 
I want to be around other Queer 
people … the energy there is really 
good, it’s a lot of fun, and there’s a 
sense of understood community 
there … Plus, the music is better.”

Necto stands as one of the only 

University 
student-accessible 

nightclubs (for both age and location) 
within Ann Arbor. It is distinctive in 
its specific openness, though there 
generally is a cost for attendance — 
$10 for anyone 21 and up, and $20 for 
18- to 20-year-olds, but it’s free before 
10 p.m. for anyone with a college ID. 
It may not be the only place to meet 
people or hang out, but it is well-
known for its feeling of community 
and fun atmosphere. Ann Arbor 
needs more Queer establishments, 
like most cities; for now, Necto seems 
to work for a lot of LGBTQ+ students. 
If you are looking for a club to go to 
on a Friday night, consider going to 
Necto for free before 10 p.m. Do NOT 
forget your MCard.

How to be “that girl”

The honorable

The false allure of term limits

DEVON HESANO

Design by Libby Chambers, Opinion Cartoonist

Charles 
Hilu 
was 
contacted 

in 
advance 
of 
this 
Op-Ed’s 

publication. 
He 
voiced 
no 

major concerns about material 
misrepresentations of facts or 
events. The Michigan Daily is 
committed to publishing a variety 
of Op-Eds & Letters to the Editor. 
O

n March 25th, 2022, 
an article titled, “Too 
Many White People in 

Trotter Multicultural Center, 
Graduate Student Claims,” was 
published by The Michigan 
Review’s Charles Hilu. This 
article 
poorly 
attempts 
to 

speculate the thought process 
of the Black graduate student 
at the University of Michigan, 
Byron Brooks. Brooks notably 
wrote a letter to the Board of 
Regents in which he claims 
that the presence of white-
identifying students in Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center 
is 

threatening the building’s utility 
as a safe space for people of color. 
Though this subject may be a 
touchy one to be analyzed and 
debated, Hilu, in his article, goes 
so far as to tastelessly disrespect 
and disregard the concerns 
of Brooks and other students 
of color at the University of 
Michigan. 

At the beginning of the article, 

Hilu very aggressively coins 
Brooks as a “racist.” Though the 
coining of Brooks as a “racist” 
is open to debate, before even 
articulating 
his 
reasoning 

Hilu 
demeans 
the 
valuable 

thoughts of a student who is, 
rightfully, concerned with his 
community’s well-being. In the 
third paragraph of this work, 

Hilu also writes that a “common 
sense of decency” is uncommon 
in 
U-M 
students. 
Hilu 

demonstrated a lack of genuine 
intellectual rigor; instead of 
honestly contending with the 
argument Brooks was making, 
Hilu depended on tired dog 
whistles to whip his audience 
into a frenzy. Hilu has destroyed 
his own credibility by shutting 
down 
Brooks’s 
attempts 
to 

facilitate an honest conversation 
about privilege and security for 
people of color on our campus. 
The point of Brooks’s letter, 
and very explicitly, the core of 
his requests at the end of his 
writing, is ignorantly thrown 
away by Hilu. 

Later in the article, Hilu 

writes — in regards to Brooks’s 
suggestion that the University 
of Michigan Board of Regents 
take action and uphold their 
equity — that “His words are 
vague because he knows the 
only thing that would remedy 
his concerns is some form of 
racial segregation or privilege.” 
First and foremost — though one 
could perhaps infer based upon 
the tone of the letter that Brooks 
would prefer the segregation of 
students — the only thing that 
Brooks explicitly asks of those 
in power at the University is 
that they address this issue 
formally on campus and “set up 
a meeting with student leaders 
of color accross [sic] campus to 
ensure that true equity is being 
upheld.” Secondly, a productive 
article would suggest possible 
solutions as opposed to simply 
bashing a student for speaking 
out. 

Though Brooks’s ideas are 

debatable, 
this 
article 
has 

misused 
and 
misconstrued 

the meaning behind Brooks’s 
original letter and ultimately 
demonstrates to all students 
that if they genuinely express 
themselves to those who have 
the power to make change, they 
will be publicly ridiculed instead 
of worked with. The vicious 
attacks Hilu instill in his article 
only reinforce the feelings of 
discomfort that students may 
feel on campus and the doubt 
that students may have in the 
willingness of policy makers to 
address their needs. Through 
and through, Hilu’s article only 
stains his reputation as a writer 
and the University of Michigan’s 
image as an institution. 

Hilu, 
in 
his 
article, 
also 

teases and disrespects Brooks 
when he infers that Brooks has 
a fear of white people. Racial 
trauma is described as “mental 
and emotional injury caused by 
encounters with racial bias and 
ethnic 
discrimination, 
racism, 

and hate crimes.” This is an issue 
much more abundant in today’s 
younger 
generation 
than 
one 

would think, and it is an adversity 
to be taken seriously, yet Hilu 
makes fun of this concept. Making 
fun of a topic that’s significant 
in the lives of many people of 
color all across the nation is 
simply 
inappropriate. 
Again, 

Brooks’s ideas on the occupancy 
of white individuals in the Trotter 
Multicultural Center should be 
debated, but Hilu disregarding the 
legitimate and real racial trauma 
that many people at the University 
relate to is no better than openly 
spitting on the mental health of 
students.

SportsWednesday: Michigan’s dominant season is 

one more step in a culmination of excellence

In the 46 years before 2021, Mich-

igan women’s gymnastics never 
passed the 198-point mark, though 
it had come close a couple 
times in the years leading 
up to it. 197.950 in the 2020 
Elevate the Stage meet, then 
six days later it put up a 197.9 
against New Hampshire. 

But, since eclipsing the 

198 mark — a mark which 
means, on average, every-
one on the team needs to get 
a 9.9 or better in every event 
— it hasn’t looked back. The Wolver-
ines surpassed it four times in 2021 
and thrice in 2022, including setting 
a new record of 198.525. Over the last 
two years, the program has elevated 
itself to another level.

“We want to walk in there being 

confident, being aggressive and feel-
ing like, I always quote a saying I got 
from Lloyd Carr years ago, ‘Know 
the outcome before you begin,’ ” 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki said 
Saturday. “That’s my definition of 
confidence and we have used that 
a lot and that’s how we want to feel 
about how we’re going to go into Fort 

Worth.”

Michigan won the National 

Championship last season and it’s 

not slowing down, prov-
ing itself to be even better 
at both the individual and 
team level. 

Let’s run through some 

numbers.

Junior 
Sierra 
Brooks 

is averaging a 39.562 all-
around score. The program 
record is 39.526, set by 

Natalie Wojcik in her fresh-

man year — Wojcik is still on the 
team, with a 39.328 all-around score. 
Junior Gabby Wilson has an all-
around score of 39.465, good enough 
for third in program history. Sopho-
more Naomi Morrison’s 39.436 will 
also be a top-10 score.

Settling further into the details. 

Wilson’s vault average of 9.910 is fifth 
in program history. Her bars average 
is sixth in program history. Her floor 
routine average of 9.955 is best in 
program history. Brooks’ floor aver-
age of 9.943 will settle into second 
place behind that and Morrison’s 
will plummet all the way down to 

fourth in the record books once the 
season ends. 

Wojcik, who won the individual 

national championship in beam in 
2019, is averaging a 9.915 — a stan-
dard of excellence that falls only 
behind her own scoring average 
from when she won the title. By the 
time Wojcik’s career is over, she will 
hold three of the top four spots in 
Michigan’s record book for average 
beam score. 

Each of these individual levels of 

excellence compound themselves 
into a team that can compete at the 
highest level. 

The Wolverines are the best floor 

team in program history, outpac-
ing the second highest by nearly 
two 10ths and their beam score is 
the best in program history with a 
49.321. Their vault score, despite an 
uncharacteristically poor perfor-
mance against Nebraska, will be sec-
ond highest in program history and 
their bars performance is also sec-

ond in the country. Both of those are 
second-best only to last year’s team.

Michigan’s season-average score 

of 197.841 is tied for first in the coun-
try with No. 2 Florida and, if the 
season ended today, would make 
this the best team in program his-
tory. Second-best is 2021 and third 
is 2020.

It’s hard to follow up a national 

championship season with one 
that can match that level of success. 
Throughout the season, the Wolver-
ines have proven they can be even 
better than last year.

This weekend, they showed an 

ability to battle through adversity 
to match these numerical advance-
ments. Coming in second during the 
second round, they didn’t coast into 
the regional finals — it was just their 
second time all season not winning a 
meet. They struggled on bars, along 
with a logistical default costing them 
a 10th of a point. The best vault rota-
tion in the country struggled as well 
with a 49.375. 

On 
Saturday, 
Michigan 
fell 

behind UCLA for first place in the 
meet after two events and headed 

toward a knockout battle with Mis-
souri for the final spot in the NCAA 
semifinals. 

By the end of it, though, the 

Wolverines forced a nearly half-
point swing to comfortably win the 
regional. Their vault and bar scores 
— the two weak points of the second 
round — were the class of the region, 
exuding a confidence and surety that 
only those with experience in excel-
lence can display.

“For our team… when there’s 

some type of adversity or something 
that they know they need to step up 
for, I think that’s when they’re at 
their best,” Plocki said.

There’s still plenty of opportuni-

ties for Michigan to falter as it tries 
to go for a repeat national champion-
ship. There’s still plenty of chances 
for a fall or a step out of bounds. But 
the Wolverines have one of the best 
teams in the country, the mental 
toughness to overcome a mistake 
and the experience to take them back 
to the finals.

And maybe, just maybe, give 

Michigan its second title in as many 
years.

ANNA FUDER/Daily 

This season, Michigan women’s gymnastics has eclipsed many statistical milestones of 
last season’s national championship squad.

Five banners hang amongst 

the rafters in the north end of the 
Crisler 
Center, 
forever 

immortalizing Bill Buntin, 
Cazzie Russell, Phil Hub-
bard, Glen Rice and Rudy 
Tomjanovich — players I 
never had the privilege to 
watch, but as a student at 
Michigan, am required to 
know.

The Michigan wom-

en’s basketball team has 
been playing in Crisler for 
almost 50 years, though, 
and not a single jersey hangs to 
honor the women that molded the 
program. 

Five men. No women. 
With Naz Hillmon’s career as a 

Wolverine recently coming to an 
end, Michigan can continue to fol-
low the precedent of slighting the 
women’s program, or make sure 
her jersey ends up where it belongs. 

Hillmon is inarguably the best 

player to lace up for the Michigan 
women’s basketball team, and if 
her jersey never sees the rafters in 
Crisler, the University of Michigan 
athletic department has failed.

“I mean, if there’s anyone — and 

I think there are a few that came 
before her that we were trying 
to work on — I think she belongs 
in the rafters of Crisler for sure,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 

Mikaela Schulz carves her own path 

amidst dominant family legacy

KATELYN TURNER
Daily Sports Writer

Many athletes who come from 

families with accomplished relatives 
feel stuck in the shadows, unsure of 
how to forge their own identity.

But Mikaela Schulz, a junior on 

the Michigan women’s golf team, 
never had that problem.

Her cousin, LPGA golfer Morgan 

Pressel, has been a role model for as 
long as Schulz can remember. Pressel 
definitely set a high bar: she went pro-
fessional straight out of high school, 
appealing to join the LPGA tour in 
2005 as a 17-year-old. Then in 2007, 
an 18-year-old Pressel won the ANA 
Inspiration to become the youngest 
winner of a modern major champi-
onship at the time. 

“I had a lot of interactions with 

touring professionals,” Schulz said. 
“It inspired me to live that lifestyle as 
well and be really good at golf.”

Growing up, Schulz was constant-

ly surrounded by golf, female players 
especially. She was taken behind the 
scenes to see locker room set-ups, sat 
on her cousin’s lap during interviews 
and even got an up close perspective 
into professional training. 

“If you golf with them, you get to 

see the different levels of playing and 
how you don’t have to be perfect to 
be at that level,” Schulz said. “Being 
exposed to that world has led me to 
work hard and have a dream to play 
on the tour as well.”

Pressel is not the only successful 

female golfer in Schulz’s family. 

Her mother, Rachel, is an experi-

enced golfer as well who also compet-
ed as a Wolverine from 1982 to 1983. 
Naturally, Schulz went through her 
childhood with the desire to play golf 
at Michigan, declaring her dream at 
the mere age of nine and a half.

In a typical mother-daughter 

dynamic, it took until high school 
for Schulz to accept that her mom’s 
advice could go beyond inspiration.

“She would give me something to 

do and it would work,” Schulz said. “I 
would be surprised, realizing that she 
knows what she’s talking about.”

Mikaela spent countless hours 

throughout high school and leading 
up to college in order to earn her spot 
on the Michigan golf team. She battled 
burnout and low motivation and even 
considered quitting altogether. But her 
determination and grit carried her to 
the elite level she is playing at today.

In her first few years at Michigan, 

Schulz has been named an Academic 
All-Big Ten (2021), contributed to 
the 14th NCAA regionals and fourth 
NCAA finals (2021) in program history 
and came in first place at the Wolverine 
Invitational this past September.

“Y
ou get people who are like, ‘No 

wonder you’re good at golf; you’ve got 
the genes,’” Schulz said. “It’s challenging 
because it’s the hard work, not the genes.”

To balance her rigorous golf sched-

ule, Schulz has adopted and prioritized 
other passions. She plays the ukulele 
and practices tae kwon do and yoga. 

These hobbies and passions help 

Schulz distinguish her own identity. 

“Golf is a huge part 

of my life, and finding 
time to also have other 
passions while main-
taining my golf prac-
tices is really essential 
to creating my own 
path,” Schulz said. 

The 
Michigan 

winters also help give 
Schulz 
and 
other 

northern golfers the 
break they need but 
would not take in 
other climates. In the 
offseason, with playing 
outside not an option, 

she is forced to work on her swing 
and look at the more technical side 
of her game, which pays off once the 
weather turns warm and the spring 
season starts. 

“Having the winter time to rest and 

not really play gives me that exciting 
spark when we’re able to start up again,” 
Schulz said. “That’s a big advantage.” 

Despite the grueling training regi-

men of playing at an elite level, Schulz 
does not anticipate an end in sight to 
her golfing career. With an extra year 
of eligibility due to Covid-19, she plans 
to take a fifth year at Michigan to fur-
ther develop her game and mindset.

It is because of her coaches in the area 

and at Michigan, her teammates’ encour-
agement and her mother and cousin’s 
inspiration that Schulz has reached such 
heights; it’s because of them that she 
hopes to one day turn professional.

In one way, the overwhelming 

female presence has impacted Schulz’s 
perception of the male dominated 
sport, but at the same time, it has caused 
her to barely acknowledge that aspect.

“It influenced it to the point where 

I didn’t think about it that way,” Schulz 
said. “Growing up, we always had female 
golf on the TV more than men’s golf.”

While male golf is more popular, 

Schulz points out that the games 
are merely different. Men, for the 
most part, hit the ball further, which 
attracts the attention of many spec-
tators. They are also more prone to 
spray the ball, while female golfers 
typically hit the ball straighter. 

Neither the male nor female way 

of playing is better or worse — they 
are merely different.

“If you are just a spectator, you 

may not be able to appreciate the deli-
cacy and precision of female players,” 
Schulz said. “I’ve learned to appreci-
ate the beauty of the game and how it’s 
played by females and males as well.”

Her stellar family lineage may have 

conditioned her to dream big and set 
ambitious goals, but it is Schulz’s own 
passion and perseverance that has led 
her to accomplish what she has thus 
far. And as long as she continues down 
her tenacious path, she will continue 
to flourish for years to come. 

said after the Wolverines beat Vil-
lanova in the Round of 32. “We 

always talk about the 
house that Cazzie built, 
but we sometimes talk 
about the house that Naz-
zie built on the women’s 
side.”

There’s 
a 
million 

excuses as to why the few 
exceptional players that 
came before Naz haven’t 
seen their jerseys retired. 
Throughout the pre-Naz 
era, the women’s program 

at Michigan never experienced a 
great deal of success. It never pro-
duced a Big Ten player of the year, 
never posted an All-American and 
never reached the Sweet Sixteen. 
That’s a lot of nevers.

Hillmon came to a program 

devoid of historical success and 
completely renovated it. She co-
captained the Wolverines to their 
first Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight. 
She helped Michigan to its highest 
ranking in program history at No. 
4 in the AP Poll and she launched 
the Wolverines to their best season 
ever in terms of winning percent-
age.

In addition to her contributions 

to the team, Hillmon has accumu-
lated an absurd list of accolades 
and records. She is the only Wol-
verine, man or woman, to finish 

with over 2000 points and 1000 
rebounds. Hillmon became one 
of four women to score 2000 
points, became the first and only 
All-American in program history, 
became the only Big Ten Player 
of the Year in program history, 
set the program record for most 
rebounds and double-doubles and 
was named to the All-Big Ten first 
team in each of her four years.

If that doesn’t warrant a jersey 

retirement, what does?

As Barnes Arico mentioned, 

there are players that came before 
Hillmon who helped to pave the 
way for her success. Katelynn Fla-
herty, Hallie Thome, Diane Dietz 
and Stacey Thomas all have a case 
to see their numbers retired. All 
of these women were immensely 
talented players and helped propel 
the program to where it is today. 
But this isn’t about them. It’s about 
Naz Hillmon, who over the past 
four years has proved herself to be 
the best player in program history.

As corny as Barnes Arico’s 

comment might be, she’s right. To 
the women’s team, Crisler is the 
house that “Nazzie” built, and the 
University of Michigan athletic 
department needs to acknowledge 
that. Hillmon is the first player to 
wear 00 in program history, and 
she should be the last.

Retire 00.

EVANSTON — In the final game 

of the No. 23 Michigan softball 
team’s series against No. 9 North-
western, the Wolverines desper-
ately needed a win.

After dropping two straight to 

the Wildcats in similarly heart-
breaking fashion — and on the 
heels of a shocking 0-4 start to the 
Big Ten season — there was little 
room left for error. An 0-5 record in 
Big Ten play would be a deep hole 
to climb out of, and a 4-8 record 
against ranked teams could spell 
disaster for their RPI. Michigan 
needed to respond. Quickly.

And it did. Propelled by a five-

run seventh inning, the Wolverines 
(20-11 overall, 1-4 Big Ten) secured 
a crucial 8-3 victory over North-
western (24-5, 5-1). 

Like in the first games of the 

series, the Wolverines struck first, 

notching two runs in the first inning 
on contributions entirely from their 
veteran players. 

Graduate 
outfielder 
Kristina 

Burkhardt opened with a double 
and was brought home on a single to 
left center by graduate utility player 
Melina Livingston. The inning’s 
scoring closed with a deep blast 
from fifth-year third baseman Tay-
lor Bump that made it three-quar-
ters of the way up the wall. 

Following 
Michigan’s 
out-

burst, the game cooled down and 
settled into a rhythmic pitchers’ 
duel between graduate left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien and Northwest-
ern’s ace lefty Danielle Williams. 

Both teams made contact with 

the ball consistently and frequently 
put themselves in scoring positions. 
But a combination of unfortunately 
placed drives, athletic infield plays 
and timely strikeouts prevented any 
runners from reaching home. 

In the bottom of the fourth 

inning, Beaubien looked shaky for 

the first time, hitting consecutive 
batters to put a runner in scoring 
position. But two grounders and 
a pop-up got Michigan out of the 
inning scot-free. 

Still, Beaubien’s luck didn’t last. 

After she allowed runners to take 
first and second on a single and 
a walk, Wildcats’ catcher Jordyn 
Rudd finally broke through with 
a drive up the middle to take a 2-1 
lead.

But unlike the previous two 

games, the Wolverines responded 
— led again by their veterans in a 
strikingly similar fashion. With Liv-
ingston on first, Bump again hit a 
blast most of the way up the outfield 
wall for an RBI double.

For most of the weekend, the 

upperclassmen were average. But 
with their backs against the wall, 
they finally showed up in the last 
game. Of Michigan’s ten total hits, 
Burkhardt, Livingston and Bump 
accounted for six of them.

“I told the upperclassmen to start 

taking ownership of this team,” 
Hutchins said. “And I thought they 
did.” 

Northwestern 
wasn’t 
done, 

though, as infielder Nikki Cuchran 
crushed a ball over the scoreboard 
for a solo home run in the sixth 
inning. Another double late in the 
inning ended Beaubien’s night in 
favor of freshman right-hander 
Lauren Derkowski. She made it out 
of the inning unscathed, and the 
Wolverines moved into the seventh 
inning clinging to a one-run lead. 

But in the seventh, Michigan 

definitively took control. After two 
quick outs, the Wolverines were 
jump started by a double from 
freshman outfielder Ellie Sieler and 
an RBI single from Livingston.

And that was only the start. Two 

batters later, with the bases loaded, 
junior first baseman Lauren Esman 
drilled a ball to deep right that rico-
cheted off of the top of the outfield 
wall, bringing three runners home. 
Another single from junior outfield-

er Audrey LeClair brought Esman 
home, making the score 8-2.

The Wildcats tacked on one 

more run in the seventh inning but 
couldn’t rally, and with that, Michi-
gan finally survived a full game 
against Northwestern. And while 
they prevented a sweep and averted 
disaster, the Wolverines are still 
nowhere near the team they’d like 
to be.

A 1-4 Big Ten record absolutely 

won’t cut it for Michigan. If it wants 
to win another Big Ten title and 
make it to the Women’s College 
World Series, there still isn’t much 
room for error.

The performance in the final 

game was Michigan at its best: 
athletic, dynamic and led by veter-
ans who fight and put the team on 
their backs. When the Wolverines 
perform like they did in Game Two 
, they can beat elite teams. Now the 
question becomes whether or not 
they can do that consistently, and so 
far, they haven’t been able to.

“We’re 1-4 in the Big Ten,” 

Hutchins said. “If we don’t fight, it’s 
not acceptable.”

Michigan wins 
regional title, 

advances to 

National 

Semifinals

TAYLOR DANIELS

F

ollowing a second-place 
finish 
in 
its 
regional 

second round, the No. 3 

Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team had something to prove.

And Saturday night, the Wolverines 

proved why they were the Raleigh 
region’s No. 1 seed.

A dominant final two rotations 

propelled the Wolverines (26-2, 9-0 
Big Ten) to their 14th NCAA Regional 
Championship win — and their 26th 
Nationals appearance — over No. 11 
Missouri (13-5, 3-4 SEC), No. 14 UCLA 
(5-6, 3-4 Pac 12) and No. 22 Iowa 
(18-12, 5-5 Big Ten). With an overall 
score of 197.800, Michigan topped 
Missouri’s — who also qualified for 
Nationals — 197.425, UCLA’s 197.400, 
and Iowa’s 197.075.

“Thursday was definitely a little 

bit of a shakier day for us,” senior 
Natalie Wojcik said. “But coming into 
today, we really wanted to reset and 
focus on confidence and holding our 
heads high, walking into the meet and 
knowing that we deserve to be here.”

Saturday night, Michigan came 

to play.

In the first rotation, each of the 

Wolverines’ 
scores 
were 
9.850, 

leading to a respectable 49.250 after 
the first rotation on the balance beam. 
But trailing UCLA by 0.300 heading 
into the second rotation, on paper, 
it seemed like Michigan might be 
headed for a Thursday night repeat.

The Wolverines made sure that 

wasn’t the case.

Thursday, Michigan was flat, 

lacking their characteristic jumping 
and yelling after each routine. 

Saturday night, they returned to 

their usual selves, complete with fist-
pumps after senior Abby Heiskell’s 
stuck landing, even after a below-
average team score on the event.

“When there’s some type of 

adversity that they need to step up 
for, I think that’s when they’re at their 
best,” Michigan coach Bev Plocki said.

Michigan then headed to 

its first-ranked floor exercise, 
where it was missing two of 
its usual six members of the 
rotation. In preparation for 
Nationals, the Wolverines 
rested 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Gymnast of the Year — 
junior Sierra Brooks — while 
Heiskell sat with a sore heel. So 
they needed either sophomore 

Reyna Guggino or sophomore Jenna 
Mulligan to step up and deliver 
a countable score. Mulligan had 
exhibitioned on floor multiple meets 
during the season, but had never had a 
score counted for the Wolverines. 

Senior Abby Brenner delivered 

a 9.850 for the Wolverines to 
start off that rotation, and her 
performance was met with 
resounding cheers, hugs 
and high fives from 

her teammates.

Then, Mulligan delivered the 

9.825 the Wolverines needed, and 
behind Wojcik’s 9.950 event title-
sharing score, they closed the gap 
to 0.200 behind UCLA heading into 
their first-ranked vault event.

Wojcik started off the rotation with 

a 9.875, followed by Heiskell’s 9.850 
and sophomore Naomi Morrison’s 
9.900. With the momentum building 
for the Wolverines, Brooks notched 
a near-perfect vault with a stuck 
landing, earning a 9.975.

Up next was junior Gabby Wilson, 

Michigan’s star on the floor exercise, 
having earned two perfect 10s on that 
event this season.

Wilson hit off of the vault, twisted 

in the air and landed her vault with 
a picture-perfect stuck landing, 
securing her first career vault 
perfect 10 that tied the Wolverines 
with the Bruins headed into the 
final rotation.

“It was definitely great to have 

that 9.975 from Sierra and the 10 from 
Gabby, but it was a great vault rotation 
from the first five,” Plocki said. “And 
that brought a lot of energy for us to go 
in and close out the meet strong. We 
know we’re a good bar team. We’re 
confident in our ability to be able 

If they have the same 
confidence and execution 
as Saturday, they’re sure to 
have a shot.

to hit the handstands and stick the 
dismounts.”

And Michigan did.
Heiskell led off the final rotation 

with a stuck landing, earning her an 
event title-sharing 9.950. Brenner 
followed it up with a 9.900, matched 
by Brooks two gymnasts later. 
Wojcik hit a 9.925 with a near-perfect 
Yurchenko and stuck landing to earn 
the all-around title with a score of 
39.600.

Freshman Jacey Vore, who was 

pulled from the lineup last-minute 
Thursday night, stepped up to 
the springboard with a chance to 
clinch the Nationals berth for the 
Wolverines. Capping the Wolverines’ 
49.525 overall final rotation, Vore hit 
a 9.850 to send Michigan to Nationals 
with a first-place finish in the regional 
final.

“This just proves that we’re doing 

exactly what we need to do, we’re 
where we’re meant to be,” Wojcik 
said. “And we even know that we have 
even more potential than what we 
showed today, and that we can go into 
Nationals in Texas and hopefully get a 
repeat.”

If they have the same confidence 

and execution as Saturday, they’re 
sure to have a shot.
