Final vote on the issue
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Several hundred students
gathered Tuesday night to
support a Central Student
Government resolution that
would call on the University to
divest from companies alleg-

edly involved in violating Pal-
estinian human rights. CSG
voted to indefinitely postpone
the resolution after the large
number of attendees forced
the body to move the meeting
to the Rogel Ballroom of the
Michigan Union - the largest
meeting space available.
Shortly after the vote to post-
pone a final decision on the res-
olution, the crowd pressed up
against the stanchions dividing
the room and chanted "Divest"
at the CSG members for several

minutes. The assembly moved
to adjourn the still in-progress
meeting and most members
left, but.the crowd continued to
chant and later re-formed on the
steps of the Union, where more
than 100 students listened to
speeches and chanted.
Students Allied for Freedom
and Equality, one of the major
sponsors of the protest, specifi-
cally called for the University to
divest from United Technolo-
gies, General Electric, Heidel-
berg Cement and Caterpillar.

The group alleges that these
companies do business with the
Israeli military and supply some
of its equipment.
Knowing the divestment res-
olution was on the table, Dean
of Students Laura Blake Jones
attended the meeting and noted
the strong sentiments of stu-
dents present.
"I will absolutely be meet-
ing with students," she said in
an interview after the meeting.

THURNAU SERIES
Chemist draws
inspiration from
the very basics

Professor Anne
McNeil reflects on
her work thus far
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily Staff Reporter
To explain why she loves
her field, Chemistry Prof. Anne
McNeil, who is also an assistant
professor of macromolecular sci-
ence and engineering, pulls up a
picture of a kitten calmly sitting
on top of a 4000-degree flame,
protected only by an inch-thick
surface over the torch. The kit-
ten survivesbecause the surface,
RTV 615, has properties that
allow it to absorb high levels of
heat without transferring it.
Many people, after finding out
only the basic facts of why the
kitten is safe, are satisfied enough
by the answer to move on with
their lives. But such an answer
was not enough for McNeil. She
wanted to know the reasoning
behind what exactly gave the
surface such properties, down
to the last atom. This constant
urge to ask "Why?" may be one

of the qualities that factored into
McNeil's selection as one of this
year's recipients of the Arthur F.
Thurnau Professorship, which
recognizes faculty for outstand-
ing contributions to undergradu-
ate education.
McNeil has taught at the Uni-
versity since 2007. She received
her undergraduate degree from
the College of William and Mary
and went on to earn a Ph.D. in
chemistry from Cornell Univer-
sity and a post-doctorate degree
in polymer chemistry from the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology.
As a child, McNeil was a
self-proclaimed "total nerd"
and dabbled in many scientific,
fields. To understand physics,
she would pour water down her
driveway and observe how it
moved through the crevasses in
the gravel. Interested in earth
sciences and sustainability, she
wrote her grocery lists on hand-
made paper made of dryer lint.
She satisfied her fascination with
animals by housing pets such as
hamsters, chameleons and gold-
fish.

forward to migrating from their
nearly century-old buildings to
new facilities better equipped for
modern research.
The E.H. Kraus Natural Sci-

U of Iowa officials debate policy

Though University of Iowa
officials have headed calls to
crack down on sexual miscon-
duct, the Daily Iowan reported a
lack of communication persists
between the university and the
schools where expelled students
end up.
But between 2011 and 2013,
eleven people were suspended
from the university for sexual
misconduct.
Under current policy, the uni-
versity does not communicate
with other schools when a stu-
dent expelled for sexual mis-
conduct transfers to another
institution. The school also does
not receive disciplinary records
from other schools when accept-

ing transfer students.
Though university officials
have cited the Family Education
Rights and Privacy Act as the poli-
cy preventing distribution of disci-
plinary records, Frank LoMonte,
the executive director of the
Student Press Law Center, said
institutions are allowed to share
disciplinary records without a stu-
dent's permission, given that the
violation is a sexual offense.
Police suspect marijuana man-
ufacturing in a University of
New Hampshire dorm room
After a minor fire occurred
in a dorm room on the campus
of the University of New Ilamp-

shire Sunday night, investigators
suspect illicit drug manufactur-
ing could have started the fire in
the room, The New Hampshire
reported.
After extinguishing the fire,
police found marijuana, glass-
ware and other illicit drugs in the
dorm room. A press release sent
out by the UNH Police Depart-
ment stated thatthey are current-
ly unsure about whom the drugs
belong to and therefore have not
issued any charges.
Paul Dean, executive director
of public safety at the university,
issued a press release regarding
the purported drug manufac-
turing early this week.

Ukrainian and
Western leaders
deem Putin a threat
to global security
MOSCOW (AP) - In a gild-
ed Kremlin hall used by czars,
Vladimir Putin redrew Russia's
borders Tuesday by declaring the
Crimean Peninsula part of the
motherland - provoking a surge
of emotion among Russians who
lament the loss of empire and
denunciations from Western
leaders who called Putin a threat
to the world.
In an ominous sign, a Ukraini-
an serviceman and a member of
a local self-defense brigade were
killed by gunfire in Crimea just
hours after Putin's speech, the
first fatalities stemming from the
Russian takeover.
While Putin's action was
hailed by jubilant crowds in Mos-
cow and cities across Russia,
Ukraine's new government called
the Russian president a threat to
the "civilized world and interna-
tional security," and the U.S. and
Europe threatened tougher sanc-
tions against Moscow.
Vice President Joe Biden,
meeting with anxious European
leaders in Poland, denounced
what he called "nothing more

than a land grab."
"The world has seen through
Russia's actions and has rejected
the flawed logic," Biden said.
In an emotional 40-min-
ute speech televised live from
the Kremlin's chandeliered St.
George hall, Putin said the time
has come to correct a historical
injustice and stand up to West-
ern pressure by incorporating
Crimea.
"In people's hearts and minds,
Crimea has always been an inte-
gral part of Russia," he declared.
He dismissed Western criti-
cism of Sunday's Crimean refer-
endum - in which residents of
the strategic Black Sea peninsula
voted overwhelmingly to break
off from Ukraine and join Rus-
sia - as a manifestation of the
West's double standards.
"They tell us that we are vio-
lating the norms of international
law. First of all, it's good that they
at least remember that interna-
tional law exists," Putin said,
pointing at what he called the
U.S. trampling of international
norms in wars in Serbia, Iraq,
Afghanistan and Libya.
"Our Western partners led by
the United States prefer to pro-
ceed not from international law,
but the law of might in their prac-
tical policies," he said.
Often interrupted by raucous
applause, Putin said the rights of

ethnic Russians in Ukraine had
been abused by the new Ukrai-
nian government and insisted
Crimea's vote to join Russia was
legitimate and reflected its right
for self-determination.
Denouncing what he called
Western arrogance, hypocrisy
and pressure, Putin warned that
the West must drop its stubborn
refusal to take Russian con-
cerns into account. He pointed
at NATO's eastward expansion,
the alliance's U.S.-led missile
defense plans and, finally, the
Western moves to pull Ukraine
into its orbit.
"If you push a spring too hard,
at some point it will spring back,"
he said. "You always need to
remember this."
Only hours after Putin boast-
ed that the Russian takeover of
Crimea was conducted without a
single shot, a Ukrainian military
spokesman said a Ukrainian ser-
viceman was killed and another
injured when a military facility
in Crimea was stormed Tuesday
by armed men.
A Crimea police spokeswom-
an, Olga Kondrashova, later was
quoted by Interfax news agency
as saying that a Ukrainian ser-
viceman and a member of a local
self-defense brigade were killed
by gunfire coming from the
same location, and two other
people were wounded.

THURNAU
From Page 1A
In middle school, McNeil
developed a passion for chemis-
try. During her job in a library,
she frequently picked up science-
related books and began to devel-
op a specific interest in chemistry.
As a curious individual, she said
she thought she enjoyed the sub-
ject because it could answer the
fundamental question of why
things were the way they were.
"Just learning that concept
that everything gets its proper-
ties just from the chemistry that's
behind it - how atoms are bonded
together - is just what really kills
me," McNeil said. "Everything
can be explained just by under-
standing how the atoms connect
to each other, what they are, what
their identity is."
After completing her educa-
tion, McNeil began her research
to further understand atoms and
their properties. She specialized
in organic materials and how
their properties change when
arranged in different forma-
tions.
One of her current research
projects focuses on finding ways
to stabilize organic solar cells,
which could be used commer-
cially as efficient solar panels that
do not lose their properties over
time. Another project deals with
sensors that can detect harmful
substances in the environment
such as water pollutants.
Though she is certainly inter-
ested in finding practical purpos-
es for her research, McNeil said
she enjoys simply experimenting
with different configurations of
materials to learn what happens
and why. She said even if she fails
to develop a commercial product
through her findings, the new

understanding of the molecules
she worked will provide enough
satisfaction.
"In principle, if you change
the application, the stuff you've
learned along the way will still
be useful," she said. "So if you
want to target something else,
what we've learned about struc-
ture and how that influences how
these things assemble, the rela-
tionship between the structure
of the molecule and how it will
interact with another molecule,
learning that is independent of
the application."
McNeil's research has earned
numerous awards, such as the
Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foun-
dation Teacher-Scholar Award,
the Alfred P. Sloan Research
Fellowship and the Presidential
Early Career Award in Scientists
and Engineering, for which she
met President Barack Obama.
Though research is impor-
tant to McNeil, she does not let
it distract her from being a help-
ful teacher to her students. LSA
junior Sarah Cunningham, who
took McNeil's course in Organic
Chemistry, said she appreciated
McNeil's constant effort to give
priority to teaching.
"She really takes her time to
get to know her students," Cun-
ningham said. "She's not just one
of those professors who focuses
on their research and teaching is
secondary."
Though the bulk of her teach-
ing is in a lecture setting, McNeil
does her best to retain her stu-
dents' attention and keep them
receptive. She said she "brings
order to chaos" with structured
outlines displayed at the begin-
ning of every lecture. With these
outlines, she strives to make her
lectures as clear as possible while
conveying how the topics covered
correlate with one another.

Another one of McNeil's tech-
niques is to remind students often
of how the material they learn
relates to previously covered top-
ics, as well as real world concepts.
She uses demonstrations and You-
Tube clips to bring the theories
and concepts into action. Her goal
is to help her students see "how it
all fits together."
"I'll try to use real world exam-
ples whenever possible so they
can just enjoy the fact that they're
learning something about the
world around them and not just
some abstract concepts," McNeil
said. "I try to connect it to reality
and their lives as much as pos-
sible."
This organized, thoughtful
teaching style has not gone unno-
ticedbyher colleagues inthe same
department. Chemistry Prof.
Brian Coppola, who was named
Arthur F. Thurnau Professor in
2001, lauded McNeil's enthusiasm
and her genuine desire for her
students to succeed in her class.
"She is friendly and supportive
to students, while pushing them
to achieve the highest standard
of success," Coppola said. "She
doesn't simply teach students
how to take tests, but instead she
teaches people how to think about
chemistry and how to appreciate
why the discipline is so fascinat-
ing."
Students have said McNeil's
love for the topics she teaches and
for helping her students under-
stand the coursework and apply it
to their lives makes her a unique
and memorable instructor.
"You can tell she's always so

ningham said. "I think she's one
of the best professors I've ever
had in this University in terms
of explaining things so well and
organizing things so well"

BUILDING
From Page 1A
be alleviated by the construction
of a new $261 million building
on Central Campus, slated for
completion in 2019. The project
was approved by the University's
Board of Regents in February.
Biology Prof. Robert Denver
said he has experienced multiple
issues due to the Kraus Build-
ing's failing infrastructure.
"I've had my lab flooded a few
times from water leaks on the
floor above me, which destroyed
equipment," he said. "Also, water
accumulating in the ceilings led
to a large mold problem that we
had recently where we had to
essentially decontaminate the
entire building."
Biology Prof. Deborah Gold-
berg said the upgrades necessary
to prepare spaces for new faculty
members have become exces-
sive.
"It's just not a modern sci-
ence building," she said. "Every
time we get a new faculty mem-
ber, we need to update their lab.
And it costs a ridiculous amount
of money just to get it ready for
somebody to do work in."
DIVESTMENT

and continue to have dialogue."
LSA senior Yazan Kherallah,
the divestment chair of SAFE
- whose members wrote the
resolution with Rackham rep-
resentative Rae Scevers - was
upset by the assembly's deflec-
tion of the vote.
"We're angry," Kherallah said.
"Central Student Government
never gets this showing. Over
300 people showed up raising
concerns for how the University
invests in money."
The breakdown of the vote
to postpone the resolution was
21-15 with one abstention.
Some students held signs and
many wore pins and keffiyehs,
checkered black and white cloths
representing Palestinian nation-
alism.
However, some students who
attended opposed the resolution,
though substantially fewer made
a presence.
In the half-hour allotted for
community concerns - CSG's
public forum at meetings -
speakers traded three-minute
speeches advocating for and
against the resolution.
LSA junior Michele Freed,
Hillel chair, spoke against the
resolution, which she said would
heighten pre-existing tensions
on campus.
"I want multiple and diverse
narratives to come together
in peaceful and safe spaces on
campus," Freed said. "Where
all voices have a space and are
respected. This polarizing reso-

Goldberg said frequent issues
requiring extensive renovation
include strengthening floors
without the load-bearing capac-
ity to support equipment, electri-
cal and plumbing systems unable
to support the labs and air sys-
tems inadequately circulating air
containing the harsh chemicals
used in labs.
In addition to infrastructure
problems, the current designs of
Kraus and Ruthven keep labs iso-
lated from each other. The new
building's design will emphasize
an open-lab concept to foster a
sharing of ideas, resources and
methods by situating professors'
labs in "research neighborhoods"
based on overlapping interests.
"We don't have that serendip-
ity that comes because you run
into somebody, and all of a sud-
den you're drawing on the white-
board - there are no places to do
that," Goldberg said. "The cur-
rent buildings were designed in
a different era of science. Science
is now a much more collaborative
process."
Goldberg said the building
would not only have labs in the
new building, but there also
might be visible labs so students
and members of the public can
lution is bringing about just the
opposite."
Advocating for the resolu-
tion, LSA junior Sami Shalabi
spoke about his father's depar-
ture from Palestine following
the Six Day War in 1967 and his
belief that his time in the United
States would last no longer than
two years.
"I have been robbed of picking
pomegranates in the late sum-
mers, and swimming in the Dead
Sea from the real side," he said.
"Where is my reconnection?
Where is my birthright?"
When discussion of the divest-
ment came up on the formal
agenda, Law representative John
Lin motioned for postponement,
adding that the issue of divest-
ment is outside the scope of CSG.
LSA senior Chris Mays, an
LSA representative, echoed Lin's
sentiments.
"This is Central Student
Government. Not the United
Nations," Mays said.
Notingthe perennial nature of
this debate, he added, "We need
to bring this to a peaceful clo-
sure."
While Public Policy junior
Daniel Morales, a Public Policy
representative, acknowledged
that while some representatives
might be uncomfortable voting
on this resolution, he said post-
poning a vote would be disre-
spectful to those representatives
who wanted to speak out on the
issue.
LSA senior Tyler Mesman, an
LSA representative, said it would
be a disservice to the students
who elected the assembly to not
vote on an issue that drew so

looks like.
A large active-learning class-
room would'also help students
become more actively engaged in
their learning experience. Move-
able structures, group tables
instead of auditorium-style seat-
ing and technology that will
allow groups of students to share
their work with their classes
are all proposed measures to
improve the quality of teaching
and learning.
The new building will allow
these measures to be more fully
integrated with the depart-
ments that make up the Museum
of Natural History, such as the
Museums of Zoology and Pale-
ontology.
Amy Harris, director of the
Museum of Natural History,
cited the multipurpose nature of
the new building - as well as the
addition of air-conditioning - as
improvements sure to impact the
experience of museum guests.
"It'll be a fantastic and pretty
unique opportunity for muse-
um-goers not just to learn about
science and natural history, but
also to learn about the process
of research and discovery," she
said.
many to the meeting.
' "The issue was brought to us
so that we can discuss it," Mes-
man said. "We've been given the
power to vote ... we need to vote."
A representative granted
Khallerah time to speak dur-
ing debate and he implored the
assembly to vote on the resolu-
tion.
"I'm very disappointed. We're
not asking you to be the (United
Nations)," Khallerah said.
"Look at the crowd in front
of you," he added as he pointed
toward the hundreds of students
behind him as evidence that the
resolution was appropriate for
CSG.
LSA senior Suha Naj-
jar, another SAFE member, was
allotted time to speak during the
debate and decried a postpone-
ment of the vote.
"Time and time again I have
been silenced," she said. "We are
supposed to be given a platform
in this room and doors are being
shut in our face."
Throughout the meeting, LSA
sophomore Meagan Shokar, CSG
speaker, had to pound her gavel
and call for order following out-
bursts from the crowd.
A few University Police offi-
cers were present throughout
the meeting, which was delayed
by nearly an hour when CSG had
to change venues.
After the event, scores of sup-
porters of the resolution took to
the Union's steps outside to fur-
ther their efforts for divestment.
Throughout the event, students
voiced their opinions through
Twitter, using the hashtag
#UMDivest.


ENGLISH
From Page 1A
talks, and group discussions were
also facilitated among faculty and
students.
Miller, who is also the director
of undergraduate studies in the
English Department, said Tues-
day's event is only the beginning
of a broader objective to repair the
poor racial climate on campus. He
said the goal was to inform his
colleagues of the issues students
face inside the classroom and to
begin formulating solutions.
"It's a scary thing to hear
undergraduates tell you what
you're doing badly or what you
could do better in a class, espe-
cially when the stakes are as high
as they are with the issues that
were discussed today," Miller
said. "We felt like we hada choice
to either do nothing or to try to do
something."
Of the many issues addressed,
the two problems students consis-
tently brought to attention were
bias or underrepresentation of
minorities within the course cur-
riculum and poor facilitation of
classroominteraction by graduate
student instructors or professors.
Anonymous submissions from
students who had taken English
courses cited incidents in which
professors either made insensitive
comments or allowed students to
create unsafe environments.
Additionally, many submis-
sions commented on the cur-
riculum of most English classes,
saying many classes focus entire-
ly or primarily on white authors.
Participants also expressed
concern about the set of classes
required for English majors, say-

ing the classes focus on historical
periods during which minority
authors were non-existent or
lacked influence.
LSA senior Rayonna Andrews,
who identifies as Black, was one of
the English major undergraduates
to attend the discussion. She said
the English classes at the Univer-
sity often make her feel uncom-
fortable or unsafe to participate
in - a feeling that was echoed by
other minority students at Tues-
day's event.
She added that as an Inter-
group Relations facilitator, she
has seen examples of healthy dis-
cussions on difficult topics such
as race, but oftentimes observed
professors or GSIs failing to cre-
ate the proper environment and
safe space for such talks.
"Most people can't handle it,"
Andrews said. "They feel like
you're attacking them or it can
never be like this discussion we
had here. It can never be a dia-
logue type thing, it has to be like
a debate or there has to be some
type of winner or somebody has
to be belittled in the process."
The group discussion por-
tion of Tuesday's event produced
a number of possible solutions
for faculty to use. Most of the
ideas focused on creating a safe
classroom environment to bet-
ter facilitate discussion. Students
suggested that professors be more
candid in their ignorance of cer-
tain cultures and admit possible
discomfort rather than try to nav-
igate an unfamiliar culture.
Students had varying opinions
about how to deal with tokeni-
zation in the classroom. Some
argued instructors should avoid
singling out the few students of
color for "minority perspective"

since it forces an unfair burden
of representing an entire culture
without any backup. Others said
they would welcome a dialogue
with teachers to help educate
them and ease tensions. Another
idea offered was for professors
to include extra readings in their
curricula to provide historical
context so students do not have
to be the spokespeople for their
lineage.
Students also proposed
instituting "trigger-warning
announcements," which would
give students prior warning in
the course guide or syllabus that
some readings may be racially,
sexually or offensive in some
way, and would let students
know what to expect. Several
students commented that they
often felt blindsided by racial
discussions and unprepared for
such taxing dialogue, which left
them feeling unsafe for future
discussions.
Megan Sweeney, associ-
ate professor of English and
Afroamerican and African Stud-
ies, academic program director
for the English Department and
director of DAAS undergradu-
ates, said she has found many of
these solutions to be helpful in
her many classes that deal with
race, and students were able to
feel safe. She said it was impor-
tant for professors to take on the
difficult task of tackling these
issues rather than shy away from
or try to avoid them.
"The point is not to rely on
students to do the work of moni-
toring or guiding these conver-
sations but, at the same time, to
recognize that students have alot
of knowledge and experience to
draw on," she said.

remains the area with the most
tourists due to its concerts and
sporting events.
While the spring and summer
are the most popular, the colder
seasons attracts tourists as well.
Grinnell said winter sports and

fall colors are a huge magnet for
attracting tourists.
"Not everyone has fall colors
like we do here in Michigan,"
Grinnell said.
Grinnell said that Michigan's
latest TV marketing campaign
aims to target women in their late
twenties to early forties who typi-

for their families.
"Our ads are really meant to
evoke an emotion and make peo-

ple say, 'Oh I remember when I
took family vacations to Michi-
gan when I was a kid growing up
and I want my kids to have those
same experiences,' " Grinnell
said, "Or, for people who may not
have been to Michigan before, to
evoke the types of experiences
and memories that Michigan can
create."

Moving toward community health

I late January, my grandmother
was hospitalized due to
broken arm. But after the
doctors saw her
blood pressure
wasn't at the
correct level, it
was discovered
she needed heart a
surgery. Now,
halfway through
March, she is DEREK
finally able to WOLFE
go home after
spending the
past seven weeks
in the hospital and two rehabilitation
facilities. However, she's leaving
not because she's ready, but rather
because her in-patient coverage has
elapsed and the out-of-pocket cost -
$130 a day - is exorbitant.
But, this is no luxury hotel. She is
cared for by underpaid and under-
enthused nurses. Only half the
facility is occupied and the food is
atrocious. Dry chicken is served
daily. No music is playingand asmile
is hard to find. To put it simply, if I
wasn't allowed to bring my dogs
in to visit her, there'd be a severe
deficiency in positive energy.
There are certainly situations
worse than hers, but health care
doesn't have to be this way. Yes,
being sick is painful, but the
experience shouldn't be. For anyone.
The patient. The nurse. The doctor.
The administrator.
The federal government has a goal
of having 7 million health insurance
signups by March 31 as part of the
Affordable Care Act. As of March 1,
that number stands at 4,242,325. I
would be shocked if nearly 3 million
Americans signed up in 30 days.
Therefore, we have to ask ourselves
why this is the case. Perhaps the
lack of "care" in health care is why
signingup for the ACA has been such
a tough sell, especially for young
Americans. While President Barack
Obama's appearance on "Between
Two Ferns" was hilarious, there is
no escaping its desperate intent to
reach the younger generation.
So my first question is "What is
there to look forward to?" What are

we investing in? Why would anyone
want to think proactively about a
bad situation being made worse by
inefficiencies? Not to mention, in the
case of the most serious situations,
most insurance plans don't even
covereverything. It's expensive with
health insurance or not, so the odds
are worth playing.
This is the case even though the
United States spends more than 17
percent of its GDP on health care
and it's only going up. Compare
this to the approximately 11 percent
that other industrial democracies
spend. The 6-percent difference
amounts to $1 trillion. Yet, I find it
hard to believe the extra spending
is justifiable. In fact, according to
an article in the Huffington Post,
Americans do not live longer than
citizens of other countries whose
healthcare expenditures are far less.
That's cause for concern.
What's also cause for concern
is the ignorance of public figures.
In response to U.S. Sen. Bernie
Sanders (I-Vt.) on the March 10
episode of CNN's "Crossfire," former
Republican presidential candidate
Rick Santorum said, "We've had
guaranteed health care in this
country for a long time. Anybody
that shows up, whether you're a
citizen or not, you come to a hospital
and you need care, you get health
care. So don't - don't say that people
don't get health care."
This is nothing to hang your hat
on, Mr. Santorum. There are few
things less efficient than having
people show up at the hospital in
only dire emergencies without
any preventative medicine. Health
care is an everyday process. Not
just during emergencies with
obvious symptoms.
The system is too money-centric.
Maintaining the function of my
body should not be thought of as a
business. We're talking about human
life here, not the board game.
In 2012, my dad had foot surgery.
Afterwards, he requested a list of all
the things they charged for. Turns
out, they charge and keep track
of literally everything, including
6-cent bandages. Sure, using a lot

of bandages add up when doing
thousands of surgeries a year, but
nickel-and-diming patients just
puts a bitter taste in their mouths.
The sight of a $10,000 bill is
overwhelming and no one should
have to fear getting a necessary
surgery because of the cost. That's
just wrong.
What unifies the democracies I
spoke of previously is their universal
healthcare system. It may not be
perfect, but I feel confident in saying
it's better for the country asa whole.
Sure, this might mean longer waits
for specialized care and doctors
would be paid less, but I would bet
that doubling down on preventative
medicine by allowing everyone at
the very least an annual physical
would be highly beneficial.
What it boils down to is that
everyone deserves the health care
that they require and should be able
to receive it from professionals who
are happy doing what they do in a
positive work environment. Any
avenue that would allow this to
happen should be explored because
as it stands, the ACA does not go
far enough.
Now, of course, the second half
of the equation is not completely
relying on the healthcare system to
fix our problems. We need to invest
in our ownhealth. However, Iwill let
first lady Michelle Obama continue
to share that message.
I think it's for a good reason
that this story and argument have
been written time and time again.
Implementing a more universal
healthcare system is the solution
that makes the most sense, whether
that's in the form of a public option
or total overhaul. We have to think
rationally instead of maintaining a
capitalism-or-bust mentality when
it's simply not working. Because as
I've learned from my grandmother
and dad's situations, the status quo is
insufficient and intimidating.
It's time to move toward
community health. We are the
United States of America, after all.

The legislature was praised by Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder for "working together"
in order to pass this bill. Yet concealed
in the bill's political jargon, questionably
earmarked road improvement funds and
$7.2 million for improvements to National
Guard armories, is an absurd reduction in
funding for the National Institute of Health's
Perinatology Research Branch at Detroit's
Hutzel Hospital. This research branch is
the NIH's only institution for improving the
health of mothers and their babies.
The funding reduction will deplete its
previous subsidy from $7 million to less than
$3.5 million. Since the federal government
contributes two dollars for every one dollar
that Michigan spends, this cut will result in
a total loss of about $10.5 million. The branch
has orchestrated groundbreaking research
to improve the health of unborn infants - in
2010 they discovered a gel that drastically
reduces premature births. Therefore, cutting
the funding for this perinatology research
will undoubtedly endanger the health of
Michigan infants, as well as the robustness
of this irreplaceable research branch. This

year, road conditions appear to have taken
greater precedence than our troubling infant
mortality rate.
About seven out of every 1,000 infants born
in Michigan die before their first birthday,
a number higher than the steadily declining
national average of about six. Contrary to
common belief, this isn't an issue particular to
Detroit. Small rural counties also reported rates
higherthanthe state average in 2009-2011. The
lack of awareness and concern demonstrated
by the Michigan legislature is disconcerting.
This is a problem that should and must be at the
forefront of Michigan's political agenda.
Equally disturbing as the grave misallocation
of state funding is the prevalence of secret
agendas in the Michigan legislature. The
legislature, in which Republicans currently
hold a majority, shouldn't have the ability to
surreptitiously push controversial changes
within otherwise bipartisan legislation.
Both parties need to communicate and work
together in order to write proposals that will
help all citizens inthestate - research thataids
the prenatal health of mothers and infants must
be prioritized.

HARLEEN
KAUR

In 1970, the Black Action Movement won
demands to end the racist climate on campus
by taking the necessary actions to increase
Black student enrollment to 10 percent by 1973
and significantly increase Latino@ student
enrollment. For 40 years, our University has
broken this promise. This discovery was the
foundation for our decision to run with the
Defend Affirmative Action Party for Central
Student Government as representatives of the
new student-led civil rights and immigrant
rights movement growing on this campus and
across the nation. We know we are not alone in
our indignation. Many of you truly believe that
as the leaders and best that we claim tobe, it's
our duty to end any form of injustice.
Since last fall, minority students -
spearheaded by Black and Latin@ students
- have been speaking louder and clearer than
ever before about the hostile climate they face
on this campus.
In growing numbers, women students too
are declaring that they are fed up with the extra
burdens they face from sexual harassment and
abuse. Arab and Muslim students are speaking
out loudly and boldly against the racism and
prejudice they face on this campus. We're sick
and tired of being talked to death when we
demand that the administration do something
real to solve problems which have existed and
been talked about for decades.
We're sick and tired of the same methods
the administration has used for more than
40 years to avoid really facing up to these
problems: pious words, endless committees,
token measures falling vastly short of what is
needed, a few crumbs to co-opt a few leaders,
intimidation of students who speak out and, of
course, layers of bureaucracy to perpetuate the
cycle of failure and cover-up.
We're at a crucial time where our decisions
will make history. The movement has spoken:
to win the promise of 1970 we must lead
through actions. In August 1963, in the "I
Have a Dream" speech, Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. declared that there could be no more
"business as usual" in America until real racial
justice was achieved.
Join us this Thursday, March 20 in putting
the University on trial for its broken promises,
and deciding on a plan of action to stop
business as usual on our campus until we win

real justice and make this University what
WE want it to be. At the University Board
of Regents' meeting, we will demand the
University keep its promises to all its students
by doubling minority student enrollment,
creating a UM Dream Scholarship to open
the doors of this University to undocumented
students and ending the policy of cover-up
of rape and sexual assault on this campus.
Then we will be holding a public tribunal and
speak-out on the hostile climate on campus for
minority, immigrant and women students.
The tribunal is the next step in the struggle
to end business as usual and make the promise
of 1970 a reality. All students and organizations
are welcome to come speak the plain truth
about racism, sexism and injustice on this
campus and in American society. No one will
be discouraged from speaking out - everyone's
experience is relevant.
Detroit high school students will be among
the featured speakers, to keep our campus com-
munity anchored in the real world of struggle
around us. The tribunal will be chaired by activ-
ists, including Shanta Driver, BAMN national
chair and attorney, who argued before the U.S.
Supreme Court last Oct. 15 for the overturn of
the Proposition 2 ban on affirmative action and
for the defense of minority political rights.
But we will not limit ourselves to speaking
out. On the basis of the testimony of students,
we will democratically discuss and vote on
the next concrete actions to take in order to
make real the long-broken promises of equal
access, equal conditions, equal opportunity
and equal dignity.
Minority students should no longer have to
accept the degradation of unequal treatment
and racist slurs as a condition of being present
on this campus. Women students should not
have to live in constant fear and accept sexist
abuse as a condition of getting an education
and participation in ordinary campus life. The
Regents' meeting will be Thursday at 3 p.m.
in the Anderson room of the Michigan Union,
followed by the Public Tribunal on Campus
Climate at 7pm in Angell Hall Auditorium C.

paid off. But a couple of weeks ago,
I had an encounter that made me
question mytask-oriented nature.
Toward the beginning of Spring
Break, a professor introduced me
to a new initiative launched by
LSA and its associate dean, Philip
J. Deloria. The Power of 5, she told
me, is a project launched to break
students out of the competitive
environment that we tend to have
at the University. By passing out $5
bills in multiple large lecture halls
and to faculty, LSA hoped to inspire
a wave of giving across the college,
and a whole new giving culture,
too. As she handed me $5, she told
me to treat myself and then give to
someone else in a similar manner.
To be honest, I was pretty
taken aback. Multiple questions
immediately began running
through my head. Wouldn't it be
awkward to just give someone $5?
Who should I give it to? Should

I explain why I'm giving it to
them? Then, my realization of
these questions launched a whole
different series of questions. Why
is it so hard for me to give back
to someone? Is this really that far
outside of my comfort zone? What
kind of a person does that make me?
The day-to-day rigor and non-
stop schedule of an undergrad can
be taxing. It causes time to both
slow down so that a one-hour
lecture can seem dreadfully long,
but also make a semester or year
seem like it went by in the blink of
an eye. Something that I allowed to
slip through the cracks during all of
this is how I interact with others.
Between running from class to
class and hiding out in Hatcher for
hours on end, I stopped looking out
for my fellow Wolverines. Student
orgs became tiring and classes were
a chore. Even my wonderful job as
an RA had turned into checking
off interactions with my residents,
even though they were always
more than willing to engage in
conversation and hang out.
I didn't give away my $5 until
this past Monday. As I sat in my
room, chatting with a good friend,
I saw the envelope sitting on my
desk. I picked it up, flipped open
the envelope to peek at the bill one
more time - as if to make sure that
it didn't magically give itself away
- and then launched into a long
explanation about what I was doing.
As I saw the grin spread across her
face, I realized that it was quite

simple. By taking a few minutes to
spread this message of giving, I had
possibly brightened up her day.
Not even 10 minutes later, I saw
her passing on $5 to another friend
of ours. Already, the message was
spreading. It was contagious.
The Power of 5 was a good
wakeup call for me. I realized that
not everything I do should be on
my to-do list or scheduled into my
Google calendar weeks in advance.
Oftentimes, it's the unplanned
moments - coffee with a friend,
running into an old professor on
the Diag or going to see a movie on
a Tuesday night - that make your
undergrad experience. I'm sure years
downthe road I won'tbereminiscing
about howI finished a 10-page paper
a few days early or how great it felt
to power through a difficult reading.
Rather, I'll remember these special
moments that I share in passing. One
of my favorite childhood characters,
Winnie the Pooh, said, "Sometimes,
the smallest things take up the most
room in your heart." Cheesy or not,
these past few weeks I remembered
to appreciate the smaller things,
because they often slip by before you
can enjoy them.
So, I challenge you, next time

Working forAmeriCorp
TO THE DAILY:
As a recent LSA graduate, I
understand very well the anxieties
and hopes of students looking for
plans after graduation. I know how
overwhelming it is to think about
the options, lookingfor applications
of academia and the skills picked
up along the way in exchange for
a salary, or other indications of
success. The jobs and projects are
the details, but I hope the bigger
picture is not overlooked. The
broader populations and larger
societal influence are the recipients
and benefactors. I hope that while
soon-to-be graduates look ahead to
their careers, they take into account
their desires of impact and how

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

their professions may contribute
positively to the greater good.
I urge students and future pro-
fessionals to consider selection of
careers and endeavors on the basis
of whom they serve. When contem-
plating "whom do we want our life's
work to impact?" we think greater
about the context of professions and
the communities that are influenced
and apply our skills to the better-
ment of society. By doing this, we
become aware of the effect of our
individual contributions and can be
of service to our communities. I am
not suggesting that our work must
be our life, but merely that work and
society are not isolated.
I amwriting to encourage students
tolookmore closely atopportunities

with AmeriCorps post-graduation.
As the 20th anniversary of
AmeriCorps approaches, there is no
better time to dedicate ourselves to
our communities and a mission of
culturally sensitive service.
Opportunities with AmeriCorps
provide great exposure to a com-
munity's true needs and spirit
while serving them effectively,
where members gain professional
experience that compliments their
outstanding University of Michi-
gan education. While serving with
AmeriCorps, members are served
with an invaluable and incompa-
rable foundation for any career.

PAIGE PFLEGER

"Detroit is more than a shell of it's former glory."

I 've written about
Detroit many times, from
many different angles. I've
tried to sell it to you, to give you
a to-do list that you might try to
tackle. I've
highlighted
things I see as
being worth-
while and
hoped that
you'd have
the initiative
to follow up PAIGE
on them. I've PFLEGER
tried to give
you hope for
a future or
shatter your preconceived notions,
but more than anything, I've tried
to make you listen, and I don't
think you have been.
Detroit is more than downtrod-
den, cracking and decaying. It is
more than graffiti-stained con-
crete and windowless buildings
and ruin porn. Its name doesn't
deserve a follow-up modifier sug-
gested by Google like "slums" or
"abandoned." Photos of the rotting
Michigan Central Station have
become emblematic of this ver-
sion of Detroit - it's windowless,
it whistles in the wind like a child
with gaps between his teeth. Its
decrepitness dominates the imag-
es that have become its definition.
Detroit is more than a shell of its
former glory. It is not dead.
I consider myself a Detroiter.
Even though I only spent a few
years of my life living inside the
city itself, it's in my bones, and at
the very least I had inherited the
title. My grandmother was from
the Detroit bourgeois of the '20s,
growingup in a large house in Bos-
ton Edison, and my grandfather
close by in Highland Park. The two
met and moved to the suburbs to
begin their family - their youngest
child became the woman I know to
be my mother. She became a paint-
er at College for Creative Stud-
ies downtown. Her friends had
multi-colored, mohawks and they
frequented dive bars for pitch-
ers of beer and burgers on school
nights. I've heard stories of these
people, of the drugs they did and
the art they created in the shadows
of these skyscrapers. One man, a
painter, woke up from a bad trip
and realized he had painted the

Maybe there's another reason
beside the nudity to stick around,
after all.
When The
Pretty Reckless
aired its debut
single, "Make Going
Me Want to to Hell
Die," in 2010, it
told a caution- The Pretty
ary tale on the Reckless
repercussions of
a good girl gone Razor & Tie
bad. The record
was discussed more for lead singer
Taylor Momsen's thick make-up
and profuse nudity than for its
music, and by the end of its tour, it
was uncertain whether The Pretty
Reckless would survive beyond the
paling of Momsen's teenage rebel-
lion.
Freshly pressed and ready
to impact, Going to Hell paints a
vastly different picture. The Pretty
Reckless diversifies its sound in
its sophomore album, exhibiting
everything from unfurling rage
to grim melancholy, and through
the process, validating Momsen as
someone who is in the industry to
stay. While the album art flaunts
Momsen's nudity, the record is
less about sex than it is about pure
human emotion.
Though only two albums deep
into her career, Momsen has the
face of someone who has been
fronting a band her entire life. Her
sound airs confidence, unfalter-
ing from its intention to scar ste-
reotypes surrounding women in
rock, and her songs seem the result
of years worth of anger boiling up
inside, finally let to be released.
While Momsen's sophomore
record follows the same formula as
her debut, it goes on to artistically
innovate, bringing out the vitality
in Momsen's vocals and the versa-
tility in alternative rock as a whole.
While Momsen can inarguably

Maybe you'd expect these
things, being a rational human

lyricism and gritty storytelling
over unconventional yet engag-
ing production.
Piata is a deeply nostalgic
album filled with tracks that
reflect on Gibbs' past. Countless
criminal offenses are recounted
throughout the album, from
armed robbery to drug dealing,
but rather than feeling fabricat-
ed, each story sounds personal,
and all too true. "I reminisce on
all the crazy shit we did," Gibbs
rhymes on "Deeper," before
retelling the experience of the
woman he loves having another
man's baby. Even when describ-
ing having his heart broken in
great detail, Gibbs maintains
his credibility as a brutally hon-
est gangster. Gibbs' greatest
strength as an emcee is being
relatable, and even his darkest
tales of death and drug dealing
resonate with the listener.
The lyrical content of Pinata
invokes a visceral response.
Gangster rap is not typically
known for emotional honesty,
and Gibbs trades braggadocio
for introspective thought. The
presence of money, crimes,
women and drugs is visible
throughout Pinata, but Gibbs,
unlike many of his peers, does
not glorify or condemn his past
actions. This comes from an
older man's perspective on life,
perhaps, and Gibbs, at 31, has
seen enough of life to be jaded.
At times, he sounds exhausted
in his raps, world-weary from
his life experiences. This is not
to say that Gibbs lacks sufficient
energy when appropriate - his
manic smoker's anthem teams
him up with an excitable Danny
Brown and Gibbs holds his
own against the spastic Detroit
emcee. Gibbs also showcases his
laid-back flow on several intro-
spective tracks, and his hard-
ened voice is one of rap's most
distinctive, which only adds to
his charisma behind the mic.
Where he really shines, how-
ever, is on the venomous "Real,"
the sharply worded diss track
aimed at Gibbs' former boss,
Jeezy. "Real" is a breath of
fresh air - the rare diss track
that pulls no punches and goes
directly at its target. Gibbs
exposes Jeezy's shady business
practices, cowardice and lack of
street credibility, calling him a
fraud and a liar. "Just a whole
lot of rapping, but no mother-
fucking action" is a strong claim
to make, but Gibbs backs up his
vicious rhymes with his own
credibility, making "Real" one
of the hardest battle rap songs

since Nas' legendary "Ether,"
proving that at his best, Gibbs'
sheer talent measures up to the
greats.
Gibbs' realness sets him
apart from his peers. His deci-
sion to shun major labels and
stay independent bolsters his
credibility as his own man, and
Pinata is a celebration of his
authenticity and a takedown of
other rappers' phoniness all in
one. On "Uno," Gibbs criticizes
sellout rappers and those who
seek fame.
Gibbs delivers
a compelling,
touching
narrative.
"Rapper reality shows, y'all
just attention whores / Don't
give a fuck if I set a record or
win awards / I'm just blessed to
be out here living life."
Gibbs is respected enough in
the industry to have guest spots
from gangster rap pioneers Rae-
kwon and Scarface, and he goes
toe-to-toe with both. Other fea-
tures on the album come from
younger acts like Earl Sweat-
shirt and Mac Miller, who have
also made a shift to introspec-
tive, avant-garde raps over the
last several years. Madlib's
expansive production ties the
whole package together. Beats
drift from funk to R&B and back
again, giving Gibbs and com-
pany opportunity to showcase
their lyrical talents.
Pilata is a rare modern rap
record that combines in-your-
face intensity with reflective
honesty over beats that sound
like nothing else being pro-
duced today. With Gibbs' cha-
risma as an emcee, it is easy to
overlook Madlib's contribution
to the album. The production is
steeped in nostalgic crate-dig-
ging with a contemporary flair,
and the diverse soundscape
elevates Gibbs' lyrical output,
pushing him to new levels of
creativity.
Freddie Gibbs and Madlib are
rap industry outsiders known
for their fierce independence,
and their creative freedom to
make the music they want to
pays off on the collaborative
album brimming with compel-
ling stories of sobering violence
and personal triumph.

Bench Bromance: McGary and Dakich's antics

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
INDIANAPOLIS - At one end
of thebench sits an All-American;
on the other, a 19-year old that
needs his uniform to convince
you that he's on the Michigan
men's basketball team.
The injured Mitch McGary
- clad in a suit and tie for
now - sits next to the coaches
while Andrew Dakich is almost
out of earshot from them.
Symbolically, it couldn't be
more fitting. Yet moments after
almost every single meaningful
bucket Michigan scored at the
Big Ten Tournament,' the two
came together - for a high five,
a dance, a handshake - to form
basketball's unlikeliest, and most
endearingbromance.
It's March after all, the month
synonymous with madness. It's
a time when as a nation we fall
in love with unknowns from

- Adam Morrison and Stephen
Curry -- and turn them into
household names.
McGary, an injured
sophomore forward, made
a name for himself on the
recruiting trail before coming to
Michigan, but it wasn't until last
March - when he played in 184
of'the Wolverines' 240 NCAA
Tournament minutes - that he
cemented his superstar status.
The freshman guard Dakich,
on the other hand, will likely
never play a single minute of
meaningful basketball in his
collegiate career. Despite playing
just three minutes this month
- each in the final moments
of lopsided contests - his
sideline celebrations have firmly
established himself as Ann
Arbor's latest cult hero.
In the past week alone, not
one, but two YouTube highlight
videos have been dedicated to his
dance moves.

beganmidwaythroughtheseason
when team chemistry reached
a point when he no longer felt
he had to be an under-the-radar
freshman. The dice roll, he says,
is his favorite, but normally, "I
just do something with my hands
where I wiggle them around and
just see whatI can come up with."
None of the Wolverines saw
the first highlight reel, which
has more than 14,600 hits, until
someone stumbled upon it on
Twitter while the team was on
the bus en route to Indianapolis
last week. Players and coach alike
loved it, but no one more than
McGary. Together, the pair has
begun calling themselves the
'Bench Mob.'
"Once he saw that, he wanted
tobeapartofit,"Dakichsaid. "We
came up with some handshakes,
some skits we can do. ... We don't
try to be like the stereotypical
guys who just clap. We try to mix
it up a little bit."
On almost every Wolverine
jump shot attempted over the
weekend, Dakich andbench mate,
freshman guard Sean Lonergan,
would stand in anticipation of
a make, a bit problematic since
more than 55 percent of the time
they'd immediately sitback down.
But on makes, Dakich would
make his way over to McGary
or even past him, in front of the
coaches, to celebrate with dice
rolls or dance steps.
So far, none of the coaches have
seemed to mind. In fact, Michigan
assistant coach Bacari Alexander
encourages Dakich to get "the
moonwalk in my repertoire."
"I honestly don't even know if

even knows they are doing it half

"Stay tuned."

HOCKEY
In Penn State, an ideal foe

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
In the postseason, a team with
plenty of talent and heart, but
one long prefaced by "conference
bottom-feeder" is aquintessential
Cinderella-story in the making.
Penn State is a second-year
program with a sparkling new
arena competing in a newly
formed conference against
some of the oldest, most storied
programs in college hockey. The
Nittany Lions won just four of 18
games and lost 16 of 20 Big Ten
matchups in the regular season.
Still, eight of those losses
were decided by one goal, often
late in regulation or in overtime.
Penn State has skated with No. 1
Minnesota and No. 5 Wisconsin,
holding both teams to games
decided by a single tally. So with
everything to gain - an outright
birth to the NCAAtournament -
and nothing to lose, Penn State is
not to be overlooked.
But if there is a team in this
league that knows not to be
caught off guard by the last-
seeded team, it's the No. 13
Michigan hockey team.
Though this is the inaugural
year of Big Ten hockey, these
two programs have history, if
only in the recent past. Less than
one month ago, the second-year
program embarrassed Michigan.
The Wolverines carried a 3-2
lead into the third period before
a series of egregious defensive
mistakes secured the Nittany
Lions' sixth win of the season.
And to make matters worse,
the upset was Penn State's
second conference victory of
the season and its second over
Michigan in two weeks.
"That's the thing, we're not
playing a last-place team, we're
playing a team that's literally
.500 with us," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson. "I think
that's motivation and it's
respect, and that's the game that
we're pointing at."
After a sweep over Michigan
State, this was supposed to be
the Wolverines' triumphant ride
into a second-place finish in the

conference, but instead it was
the start of another detrimental
losingstreak. Michiganfollowed
a dominant but not surprising
7-3 thwart of the Nittany Lions
in State College on Friday Feb.
7 with an abysmal 4-0 loss. In
it, freshman goaltender Zach
Nagelvoort lasted fewer than 15
minutes in net and surrendered
a trio of goals.
Though it wasn't only his
performance that decided a
loss to Penn State at home,
Nagelvoort was the goaltender
on record in the 4-3 overtime
contest.
"It would probably be easy

On Saturday, Senior Night at
Yost, Michigan was forced to
dig itself out of a hole it spent
nearly three months digging.
Having fallen out of the top

Minnesota the night before,
the Wolverines needed a win to
keep their postseason dreams
from turning into last season's
nightmare, and they had to do
it against the No. 1 team in the
nation. So with all that pressure
mounted in its home building,

Gardner competes
for starting role

'M' falls short against Maryland

Michigan football team's drills,

The fifth-
year senior is back on the field
after reportedly breaking his left
foot in November, and he said
Tuesday that he hasn't suffered
any setbacks in the recovery
process. He could be participating
in allof the Wolverines' drills,but
explained thathe has sat outsome

"I feel like I'm getting better
and better each day," he said. "By
the season, I feel like I should be
I00 percent."
Sophomore Shane Morris
and freshman Wilton Speight
aren't limited in any way, though,
and they have been nipping at
Gardner's heels to bump him from
the incumbent spot. Redshirt
junior Russell Bellomy, the only
other quarterback on Michigan's
roster with meaningful playing
experience, is still in the process
of rehabbing from a torn ACL
suffered last March.
"It'sacompetitionbetweenme,
Shane and Wilton," Gardner said.
"It's going great. Everybody's
fiercely competing.
"Wilton's got game. He can
play."
Speight chose to forgo the
second semester of his senior year
in high school to enroll early in
Ann Arbor. Though the freshman
explained he struggled to adjust
to the intensity of college ball,
if Gardner is to be believed, the
transition hasn't been too difficult.
"He makes good decisions,"
Gardner said. "He's a good
quarterback. He's a definite
threat for Shane and I."

center when the Wolverines open
their season against Appalachian
State on Aug. 30. Gardner said
he can pick up blitzes faster than
the two underclassmen, and his
extensive in-game experience
has helped him adjust to schemes
implemented by new offensive
coordinator DougNussmeier.
SPRING STATEMENT:
Michigan has several high-profile
recruits enrolling this summer,
but one freshman standout may
already be on campus.
Wide receiver Freddy Canteen,
a product of Eastern Christian
Academy (Md.), has impressed
his peers, including several of the
Wolverines' quarterbacks.
"(Receivers) are coming along
great and doing well," Gardner
said."Ilike Freddy Canteen.... He's
areallygood player."
Though Nussmeier plans to
implement a run-first offense,
he will still need to account for
the absence of former receiver
Jeremy Gallon, who set the
program's single-season record
for yards at his position last year
(1,373). And Canteen provides an
option to replace him.
MARCH ISFORFOOTBALL:
Michigan's recent struggles form
a stark contrast with the men's
basketball team's unprecedented
success.
The NCAA Tournament is
underway, and the Wolverines
have another good chance to
make their second straight Final
Four appearance as the No. 2
seed. Meanwhile, Gardner will
likely lead a team that limped to a
7-6 record last year.
The triumphs on the court can
help on the gridiron, as football
recruits often attend basketball
games during their on-campus
visits. In Gardner's eyes, only one
sport represents the University.

Its first game back on the

tests the Wolverines have seen
all year, the No. 1 Maryland

The home field advantage
and two goals apiece from a

Michigan (4-5), who fell to the
Terrapins 13-5 in the programs'

Maryland took control of

On the
defensive side of the ball,
Michigan's quick slides and
timely double teams kept
Maryland in check for a large
part of the first half, but the

Terrapins offense adapted
coming out of halftime, and was
able to find more quality looks at
the net than they had in the first
half.
"Obviously they have a very
good offense. They're the No. 1
team in the country right now
for a reason," said Michigan
coach John Paul. "We're not
very deep defensively right now,
we have some guys out and some
guys playing who haven't been
playing a lot that are making
some mistakes. It's not their
fault, they just haven't been in
this situation much."
The Wolverines will have to
get used to seeing the Terrapins
and other high-caliber teams on
a regular basis, as the Wolverines
will see Penn State, Maryland
and Johns Hopkins - all teams
currently ranked in the top 20
nationally - every season as
part of the Big Ten conference.

Paul is welcoming the
opportunity to play the nation's
top competition, and knows
playing these teams in his
program's early years is sending
it in the right direction.
"Our first two years, we'd
probably feel like 'at least we
didn't get smoked,' but today,
that was a locker room that was
pretty disappointed in the way
they played," Paul said. "That's
a good step for us. We have guys
in there who feel they match up
against teams like this, we just
have to learn how to play better
lacrosse and that's coming."
Added Paras: "We had alot of
confidence coming into today.
Years past there's been a bit of a
mystique around playing teams
like Cornell and Hopkins, but
this year we know we can hang
with them. This program's

THE VISUAL STATEMENT: SISTER'S FOOD TRUCK
BY VIRGINIA LOZANO

sI drove through a neighborhood in Grand River Detroit, I was immediately
drawn to a food cart sitting in the driveway of the house on1861 Bassett Street.
With bright pink symbols on a large metal cart, it stood out from the repetition
f small houses with perfectly gardened yards. When I returned on a Friday, I got out
of my car and was greeted by the smell of fried food, an infectious laugh and a pink
wig - all three of which belonged to Margarette Squires, better known as Sister. The
Clean Street Food Truck is her small business and contribution to fighting cancer. In
fact, her motto is: "Fry for the Cure." As a cancer survivor, Sister is truly tenacious - a
trait she applies to her business. She works every Friday, moving hastily around her
cart, making each order fresh on the spot and letting it live up to its name by keeping it
extremely clean. The menu is reminiscent of Southern food, featuring Sister's famous
catfish sandwiches, and my personal favorite: her homemade banana pudding. Sister's
ability to create a community is her most impressive trait. She knows every customer
by name. She currently has plans to help her friend Cynthia open a new food cart -
Mother-dear's Gumbo - a few streets away. Even though Basset Street is only a small
part of Detroit, Sister's Clean Street Food Truck embodies the ambition and sense of
community that the city offers.

INSIDEOUT
L TERARY ARTS:
YOUTH-DRIVEN
AND INSPIRED
BY JENNIFER CALFAS

The Detroit Institute of Arts
(DIA), formerly known as the
Detroit Museum of Art, has been
a landmark in the city since its
creation in 1885 by James Scripps,
a newspaper publisher and
philanthropist with a love for great
art.
Scripps donated the first pieces
to the museum - 70 Dutch and
Flemish paintings he had collected
while traveling around Europe
- which were valued at around
$75,000.
Over the years, the DIA evolved
and changed, taking on different
forms as other museums in the
area combined with it. At one
point, a natural history museum
was absorbed into the museum, so
that there were antlers and stuffed
animals in one gallery along with
art.
It wasn't until the 1920s - by
which time the museum's name
had been officially changed to the
Detroit Institute of Art - that the
museum began to thrive, due in
large part to private donations.
The collection continued to grow
with each new director, who made
their own contributions. James
Scripps' son-in-law, Ralph Harmon
Booth, was actively involved in
bringing German scholar and art
connoisseur, William Valentiner,
into the project. Together, the pair
helped the museum acquire what is
now one of the greatest collections
of European art in the country.
The last substantial lifetime gift
the DIA received came in the 1970s
from Eleanor Ford. The museum
used the money to build their
African collection.
This collection - considered
one of the best in the United
States - includes an astounding
65,000 pieces, ranging from classic
paintings to indigenous American
sculptures. Six thousand of these
pieces are currently on display in
the museum - van Rijn, Vincent
van Gogh, Jan van Eyck, Henri
Matisse and Pablo Picasso, to name
a few of the highlights. But the
museum is also one of the most
representative, with pieces from
almost every culture in the world.
"We regard ourselves as what we

now call a universal museum," said
Graham Beal, director, president
and CEO of the DIA. "But you can
also use the term encyclopedic,
which basically means there is no
where in time or geography that
we will not go looking to acquire
art. The only significant area where
we have genuine weakness is the
Oceanic, or the art of the Pacific
Islands. You can see dozens and
dozens of cultures represented
here."
Current difficulties
In recent years, the city ofDetroit
has faced severe financial turmoil,
filing for bankruptcy in July 2013.
The city's financial straits directly
affected the museum when Kevyn
Orr, the emergency manager
appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder
to handle the city's finances,
announced that he would consider
selling the museum's art, if it would
help the city's financial crisis.
The DIA's art can be sold
because the museum is not a
nonprofit organization like many
museums, but rather a city agency,
like a public library. In 1920, when
the independent organization that
was running the museum could no
longer afford to keep up operations,
an agreement was reached wherein
the building and its collections
were turned over to the city of
Detroit.
The foundation that started the
museum, which renamed itself the
Detroit Museum of Art Founders
Society after operations were
turned over to the city in 1920,
stayed on to work as an advocacy
group, raising funds to continue
purchasing art until 1998. After
that year, the city could no longer
maintain the museum on its own,
so operations were subcontracted
back to the Founders Society under
the name the Detroit Institute of
Arts, Incorporated.
The city, therefore, owns the
building and all the art inside, while
the independent, not-for-profit
organization has been responsible
for taking care of day-to-day
operations within the museum.

An uncertain future
As the building and collections
belong to the city of Detroit, it is
within the city's right to sell the art
as they see fit. Several steps have
been taken to avoid this unpopular
outcome. Several foundations in
the city have stepped forward to
pledge roughly $370 million to
the museum to help it maintain
the collection, as well as assist the
pension program.
From this, a plan has been
negotiated, but not finalized, where
the money from the foundations -
in conjunction with $100 million
dollars pledged from Detroit
Institute of Arts, Inc., which is the
organization running the museum
and $350 million promised by
the state - would be used to turn
the museum back into a privately
owned not-for-profit again.
"The deal would be that the city
would relinquish the building and
collections to that independent,
not-for-profit entity," said Jeffrey
Abt, a professor in the department
of Art and Art History at Wayne
State University. "Then it would
continue on into the future as it had
originally been established."
If the plan does go forward
and the museum is turned back
into a nonprofit organization, the
financial position of the museum
could be strengthened in the long
run.However,the museummayface
some financial difficulties in the
short run as it had already agreed
to a plan, before negotiations had
begun about turning the museum
back into a nonprofit, that would
require them to raise $400 million
in 10 years, in addition to the $100
million the nonprofit entity pledged
to raise over the next 20 years.
The museum's future, though, is
still unclear as plans move forward.
Until the uncertainty is cleared up
the museum intends to carry on
operations as normal.
"Right now it's business as
usual," Beal said. "We know what
we want to do, we're very aggressive
and I don't think I'm boasting when
I say we're one of the leading art
museums in this country."

Christopher had an idea. Shifting his
weight from side to side in his desk, the
third grader raised his hand, begging to answer
a question.
Upon being called on, Christopher stood up
in his seat.
"A good writer never stops writing," he pro-
claimed.
University alum Peter Markus looked around
at the students who sat in hisclass to gauge their
reactions to Christopher's statement.
"They also not only never stop looking at the
world, but also listening to it," Markus added as
he launched into the day's lesson plan, which
examined how a writer should describe sound
with metaphors and similes.
This lesson is only one of hundreds Markus
has taught over the course of 20 years. Hav-
ing taught at several schools across Detroit,
Markus has found his niche in the InsideOut
Literary Arts Project. Throughout his career, he
has found that students are not shy about shar-
ing their work, but rather prideful, eliciting an
exciting, almost chaotic atmosphere in his third
grade class.
Founded in 1995, InsideOut has expanded
from one to 27 schools across the Detroit area,
reaching over 5,000 students. Established writ-
ers and poets work with K-12 students over a
period of 25 weeks to explore various aspects of
poetry, writing and thinking.
While Markus just started teaching at Mann
Elementary School - a 30-minute drive from
the University - he maintained the same goal
for each school he encountered.
"We encourage students to create broadly,
create bravely and experiment in how they see
the world," Markus said. "We want them to
learn to express themselves and engage with
each other in a deeper, more complicated way."
A new approach
The MEAP exam measures proficiency in
several areas, including reading, writing and
mathematics, among other categories. Accord-
ing to Mann Elementary School's 2013 report
released Feb. 28, the percent of students at least
proficient in writing increased from 23.6 per-
cent to 25.6 percent from the 2012 to 2013 year
to the 2013 to 2014 year.
While the increase has established a prom-
ising trend, Markus said standardized testing
is not how students should learn how to write.
During his classes, Markus tailors his lesson

plan individually to each student, allowing
them to explore according to their individ-
ual needs.
One of his students, Mark, often jumps from
his seat whenever given the opportunity. With
his builtup energy - typical of an eight-year-old
boy - Mark has difficulty paying attention in
class. To keep Mark engaged, Markus encour-
ages him to perform what he is thinking in front
of the class to release his energy.
"If you can invite the kids to go slightly out-
side of their bubble, they love it," Markus said.
"That's how you can keep kids engaged is to
offer them alternatives to sitting in their chair,
just numbing out, because all they do is take
tests and prepare to take tests."
As the nonprofit approaches its 20th year,
Alise Alousi, InsideOut's associate director, said
there are plans for expansion - not externally,
but internally. In several high schools already,
InsideOut has already launched new after-
school programs and individual mentoring ses-
sions.
While the program expands, its mission
remains an interminable, constant entity.
"That's what the great beauty of our program
is - we're sending writers who have a sense of
their craft into a classroom to really engage stu-
dents and give them an opportunity to explore
that knowledge," Alousi said.
Underappreciated,yetrevolutionary
Detroit is no stranger to national attention.
Reports of the city entering the largest munici-
pal bankruptcy in U.S. history and suffering a
population decline from 1.86 million residents
to 700,000 over the past 60 years continue to
plague Detroit's image.
InsideOut hopes to help those affected by
this ongoingcriticism.
Of all students in the state of Michigan, 83.1
percent are proficient in reading. In Detroit's
public schools, however, only 67.4 percent are.
At Mann Elementary, is only about 63.6 percent.
At Mann Elementary, 289 of the 491 students
are deemed "economically disadvantaged."
Despite not meeting state standards accord-
ing to this test, these young students in Detroit
are already published writers.
One of InsideOut's most unique qualities is
its effort to publish poems by each student at the
end ofevery year.
"It's a huge undertaking we've never stopped
believing in," Markus said. "It's something we

really continue to value; students deserve rec-
ognition for their classroom work."
In spring 2013, students from Mann Ele-
mentary School had their work published in
a collaborative book titled "Here, There and
Everywhere." In the book, every student from
the program ranging from third to fifth grade
explored topics ranging from their desire to
own a pet monster, to their favorite place in the
world.
Each student receives a copy of the book as
a memento of his or her work with InsideOut
from the year. Just as screenwriters often carry
around their manuscripts for films, Markussaid
he hopes students will do the same with their
published pieces.
"Every student deserves to be heard,"
Markus said. "They all have unique voices that
are open, full of ideas and creatively showcased.
It's really an empowering moment when you
hand a student a book thatthey will preserve for
years."
From college to elementary school
LSA junior Leela Denver grew up in Ann
Arbor, but rarely ventured to Detroit. Sure, she
attended a concert in the city every once in a
while, but her visits, as she described, were
"artificial"
As the Spring 2013 semester approached,
Denver was looking into study abroad oppor-
tunities when Semester In Detroit came to
her attention. The program, which aspires to
engage University students with the city's com-
munity and culture, caught her eye. While she
lived 40 miles away from Detroit her whole life,
Denver considered the city as destination ready
for exploration, topping the list of her study
abroad aspirations.
"I chose Semester In Detroit instead," Den-
ver said. "I was going abroad, but to a place with
more meaning; it's my state and my country.
Everyone should have that kind of experience."
Once she was accepted to the program, Den-
ver chose to intern with InsideOut. As an Eng-
lish major, Denver was drawn to the program
for its focus on creative writing and literary
expression. However, what made the program
unique to her was the city it was based in.
"Detroit shaped the whole thing," she said.
"The whole experience was. about learning
about the city I've always been so close to and
not known much about. It gave me a way to
interact with people of the community that

wasn't so artificial."
Denver worked with Markus at Marcus
Garvey Academy, a pre-kindergarten through
eighth grade public school in Detroit. During
her internship, she taught one ofMarkus'classes
a lesson on her own, as well as helped students
around the classroom during Markus' lessons.
"Their imaginations were really outstand-
ing," Denver said. "Getting in the mind of the
kids was something I've never experienced
before."
Denver is one of several University students
who have worked with the InsideOut program
over the past four years.
Additionally, as part ofthe University's Helen
Zell Writers' Program, the Civitas Fellowship
awards a small group of Master in Fine Arts
students funding to work with InsideOut for 10
hours a week for 30 weeks.
Alousi said this program allows MFA stu-
dents to expand their knowledge of teach-
ing beyond a college environment, which she
deemed as much easier to manage than an ele-
mentary school one.
"They have to deal with issues," Alousi said.
"The kids want to be playing, and these students
have to learn how to accommodate their lesson
plans for the needs of the kids."
Alasting impact
Christopher sat 'down in his chair after he
answered Markus' question. Though his energy
was still palpable, so were the wheels churning
in his mind.
A few minutes later, Markus played sounds
for the students to listen to. He then instructed
them to announce what they believed each
sound was - as descriptively as possible.
Christopher sat up in his seat and positioned
a pencil in front of his nose, fixing his eyes on
the eraser that hovered one inch from him. He
gazed into what Markus described as a "dream
pencil" - a mechanism that allows students to
explore the depths of their mind, allowing fan-
tasies to become realities on paper.
"It sounds like a knight running toward a
woman trying to save her from the bad guy,"
Christopher announced moments later during
a flurry of students raising their hands to share
what they heard.
"We're teaching them how to see more than
what others see and feel more than others feel,"
Markus said. "The whole human beingneeds to
be developed and needs to be innovative."

DETROIT FUTURE CITY: A 50-YEAR EXPERIMENT IN URBAN PLANNING

BY AAM RUTHA SI VAKUMAR

How long does it take to revive a city
burdened with nearly $20 billion in
debt, unfunded liabilities, a steadily
declining population and over 70,000 aban-
.,doned structures?
According to Detroit Future City, many of
these problemsowillibe alleviatedby 2065.
By then, Michigan's biggest city will look a
lot different, if everything goes according to
plan. Transportation systems will be improved,
vacant space will be repurposed for public use
and Detroit will become a beacon of environ-
mental friendliness.
Re-organizing the city is a tall task, consid-
ering the Motor City's dwindling population,
but it's a challenge that's not too daunting for
the Detroit Works Project.
The project began in 2010 under former
""Mayor Dave Bing's administration to rethink
the land-use policies that affected Detroit's
future. In the fall of 2011, the Detroit Works
project was divided into two components -
Short-Term Actions and Long-Term Planning
- and independent contractors were hired
to separately develop long-term strategies for
Detroit.
After a three-year-long process detailing the
challengesand possiblesolutionsfacingthe city
of Detroit, the Detroit Works Long-Term Plan-
ning initiative, rebranded as Detroit Future
City, released a 347-page strategic framework
in December 2012 that suggested innovative
policies that would reinvigorate the city.
By focusing on five planning areas - eco-
nomic growth, land use, city systems, neigh-
borhoods and building assets - the outline
pinpoints areas of potential improvement and
suggests short-term and long-term solutions
that ease the city into transformation.
In some aspects, the Future City frame-
work reflects a page out of an Economics 101
textbook. Since it operates on the premise that
there willbe very few resources available from.
the state, the framework considers how to best
allocate its scarce resources among the differ-
'"ent regions of Detroit.
"It should be shocking in some respects,
but it's also understandable once you under-
stand the logic of the report," said Wayne State
University Law Prof. Peter J. Hammer, who
teaches a course on reimagining development,
calling the trade-offs made in the framework
"defensible, logical triage choices."
Though the Detroit Works Project plans to

improve the city community, it struggled to
receive input from the citizens it would affect
most in the earliest stages of development.
While early city planners looked to develop
the framework around long-term land-use
strategies, citizens who attended early civic
engagement meetings were more interested in
how the government could address their short-
term needs - such as improving neighborhood
safety and demolishing abandoned households
- June Thomas, centennial professor of urban
and regional planning at the Taubman College
of Architecture and Urban Planning, said.
As a result, 24 "Process Leaders" were hired
to incorporate civic engagement into the plan-
ning process. The Process Leaders comprised
leaders from organizations that ranged from
local churches to nonprofits and aimed to
equitably reach out to all their constituents for
input. They collectively held over 30,000 one-
on-one conversations, Charles Cross, former
Process Leader, said.
The Process Leaders developed a series of
innovative tactics to reach out to the commu-
nity. Such tactics included creating an Eastern
Market Home Base - where citizens could
attend regular open houses to clarify some of
their inhibitions surrounding Detroit Works'
Long-Term Planning - and setting up Roam-
ing Tables around different areas in the city to
spread awareness.
"Part of the Process Leader concept was
that it shouldn't be a few people talking to
many people, it should be many people talking
to many people," said Cross, who is currently
a landscape and urban designer for the Detroit
Collaborative Design Center. He added that the
goal was to showcommunity members that the
Future City process was "authentic and trans-
parent," while ensuring that the input received
was "meaningful."
"This was to help develop a way to engage
community and one of the ways we looked at
this was not through the lens of 'OK, we have
got to have a community meeting, OK we can
check that box off,' " he said. "We looked at
community engagement or civic engagement
as growing relationships. Through these rela-
tionships we then created dialogue."
Thomas, who attended the early commu-
nity engagement meetings, saw the disconnect
between the citizen's parochial requests for
their neighborhood and the project sponsor's
long-term ambitions as one of the project's

weaknesses, though she added that the project
addressed issues that impacted a large number
of citizens.
"Itwas the economic growth that seemed to
have the most public interest," Thomas noted.
"People would stand in front of the posters
for that particular element (of the Future City
engagement process) because people recog-
nized that a lot of Detroit's problems (are) relat-
ed to its economy."
Through the 347-page strategic framework,
the Process Leaders embedded images of sil-
houettes and thought-bubbles that reflected
the comments of the community pertaining to
the issues addressed.
"I distinctly remember one woman coming
in and she was reading different things on the
wall and she said 'Hey, I said that. That's my
comment,' " Cross recalled. "We have to make
sure that people can see themselves in the doc-
ument."
Despite Future City's extensive civic
engagement efforts, Thomas said she believed
the project prescribed recommendations for
the city at a macro-level, and did not entirely
reflect the exact desires of a citizen for the
development of their neighborhood.
"When queried about this, the lead plan-
ner said that essentially they were doing this
because they were looking at the broader scale
and later, neighborhoods could be planned
within the framework," Thomas recalled.
"Because in some ways, the beauty of the docu-
ment and its polish and its professional quality
is a weakness. It didn't have the time to build
from the ground-up, it built from the top-down
in terms of the expertise being flown in to pre-
scribe."
Although implementation projects for the
Future City framework have just begun, the
Process Leaders who lead the community
engagement for Future City are no longer con-
tractually hiredby the organization.
"The big push for citizen engagement is
likely over," Thomas said. "There's a discon-
nect between the citizen engagement and the
issuance of these priority areas and I wondered
because they've released the staff that were
essentially charged with citizen engagement;
they've been off the job for about a year."
However, Cross said that though he was no
longer on the Future City payroll, the Process
Leader continually meet to consider ways in
which they can provide the Future City with

KATHERINE PEKALA/Daily
community input. He further added that a
formal partnership with Future City was not
required to achieve the goals of the organi-
zation and he would continue to work with
DCDC to further its mission.
"We didn't have our contract renewed to
continue in a leadership type role because what
we think is that there is not only just one way
to be a part of Future City," he said. "You don't
have to go through and geta stamp of approval
from Future City, and we, as the Detroit Col-
laborative Design Center, can be a conduit to
do what we do and still be connected to Future
City."
For Thomas, the Future City strategic
framework seems riddled with urban planning
irregularities. Not only does the framework
cover a longer planning horizon than what
most other planning projects operate under,
but it also lacks a concrete way to enact the
document's proposals.
"That's a little bit unusual because usu-
ally comprehensive plans try to do that and if
they're connected with city government they
try to find that," Thomas, who has written
several books on urban planning and the land-
scape of Detroit, said. "But this is disconnect-
ed, so it's not safe in that way. But then again,
people are beginning to use that, and the city
itself is beginning to fund areas according to
the priorities areas."
In late February, nearly a year and a half
after releasing the strategic framework and
rebranding as Detroit Future City, the imple-
mentation team responsible for executing the
proposals outlines in the framework released
their priorities for 2014-2015 and announced
the 31 projects they would work to support over
the next year.
James Canning, media relations spokes-
person for Detroit Future City, said the orga-
nization was now teaming with partners
throughout the city to coordinate their efforts
in line with the goals of their strategic frame-
work, and help partners "make the most out of
their budget."
"It's kind of really strange, it's a strange time
when thisunofficial documentthatwas funded
by foundations is beginning to reshape invest-
ment decisions but it can't g uarantee them,
fund them, or lead them," Thomas said. "It's
kind of an experiment."

W hen Detroit Mayor
Mike Duggan was a
student at the Uni-
versity in the '80s, he used to
organize a group of friends to go
down to Tiger Stadium for open-
ing day every year. For many of
those students, the annual trip
was their only exposure to the
city. According to Duggan, young
people didn't want to settle down
in Detroit or even road trip there
- they had New York, Chicago or
Los Angeles on their minds.
Now, Duggan looks out his win-
dow everyday at Woodward Ave-
nue from the Mayor's Office. On
the surface, the mayor faces many
of the same problems that made it
a foreign and unappealing place
to many of Duggan's college peers
- deindustrialization, depopu-
lation, high unemployment and
crime.
With the start of Duggan's
time in office comes a new chance
at reversing these longstanding
problems to bring the city back
to the prosperity it experienced
in the 1950s. Duggan is the first
white mayor of Detroit since 1974,
winning 55 percent of the vote in a
city that is over 80 percent Black.
His campaign platform centered
around crime reduction and finan-
cial and economic turnaround.
Two months after that message
landed him in office, Duggan met
with President Barack Obama to
discuss how to make those ideas
a reality.
"The conversation was about
how do we bring jobs to Detroit
and how do we train Detroiters
for jobs," Mayor Duggan said in
an interview with The Michigan
Daily. "It was totally focused on
creating opportunities."
He declined to say more except

that there was no conversation
about "writing a check for the
city of Detroit," something many
are hoping for in light of its bank-
ruptcy.
Though they're keeping quiet
about the details of their con-
versation, the report President
Obama asked Duggan to give him
in 90 days should include a lot
more than repairing streetlights
and working out a viable budget
plan with the state-appointed
Emergency Financial Manager
Kevyn Orr.
And besides the well publi-
cized issues, Duggan admitted
that some of his conversation with
the President included Detroit's
longstanding public transporta-
tion problem. It's an issue that
has taken a backseat to bankrupt-
cy, but which is vital to bringing
Detroit up to par with the likes
of some of the cities his college
friends decided to settle down in,
many of which to feature efficient
transportation within, as well as
back and forth from their city lim-
its - whether it be subway, rail or
otherwise.
"A piece of (the solution) is that
we have to get people to the jobs,"
Duggan said.
To date, Detroit's primary pub-
lic transportation service comes in
the form of two bus systems - the
Detroit Department of Transpor-
tation (DDOT) and the Suburban
Mobility Authority for Regional
Transportation (SMART). Each
morning, DDOT tries to field 220
buses to meet'the needs of the
city's residents. DDOT buses are
old and in poor condition, Dug-
gan said, so on a warm day, 180
make it to their routes. On a cold
day, only 150 do. While the city is
working on maintaining the buses

they have, Duggan said it needs to
purchase 50 new ones as well.
Meanwhile, some practical
improvements to public transpor-
tation have already begun. In Feb-
ruary, Mayor Duggan announced
that the city would be installing
cameras on all DDOT buses to
create a safer riding experience.
But buses are often a compli-
ment to larger, more efficient
modes of public transit. Detroit
has the Detroit People Mover - a
2.9-mile elevated rail encircling
the central business district -
but beyond its limited access and
the struggling bus system, the
city lacks a comprehensive public
transportation option.
According to Joe Grengs, asso-
ciate professor of Urban and
Regional Planning in the Taub-
man College of Architecture and
Urban Planning, more than a third
of Detroit residents don't have
cars. He attributed the city's car-
lessness to high levels of poverty
and comparatively costly automo-
tive maintenance and gas prices.
"The metropolitan region is
built on the assumption that you
drive to places, so it's a tremen-
dous disadvantage," Grengs said.
Public transportation often
becomes the only option for
Detroit residents, albeit an incon-
venient one. The city's low and
diminishing densities - i.e. that
buildings and houses are far apart
from each other - are a major
problem that has arisen from a
shrinking population and tax
base.
"The great majority of build-
ings we're talking about are
single-family homes," Duggan
said. "That's what were going to
be selling and so we're going to
knock down the houses that can't

be saved."
With every transit trip comes
two walking trips: reaching the
boarding area and walking to your
destination after getting off. So,
when a Detroit resident gets off
a bus, they have to walk long dis-
tances to get to their final destina-
tion. Detroit is so low density that
it's becoming hard for residents to
reach that destination at all - to
the point that they choose not to
make use of it in the first place.
"By investing in public transit,
hopefully we can also in turn start
to attract new investments into
the city in a more dense way that
makes the environment a more
sustainable situation over the long
run," Grengs said.
Chris Mourgelas, an architect
for the United States General Ser-
vices Administration, commutes
into the city each morning from
Ferndale. He said that while
Detroit's public transportation
is much different than what he's
used to having grown up in Chi-
cago, the commute to work is
generally fine, though buses are
sometimes late and break down.
"I started riding the bus when
my car transmission failed," he
said. "With that, I decided I'd take
it into the shop and try the bus for
a day and it was fine enough that I
didn't replace that car. We're now
a one-car family. Have been since
2004."
Craig Regester, associate direc-
tor of the University's Semester in
Detroit Program, said he was also
fortunate enough to own a car
during the 20 years that he lived
in the city.
"I did bike a fair amount," he
said. "I rarely used public transit
mostly because it wasn't particu-
larly convenient as far as timing
and where I needed to go, frankly.
And the system itself has been
seriously challenged for a very
long time."
Regester - who spearheaded
the MDetroit Center Connector
that allows University students
to travel to the city - said public
transit is an issue for residents
who have to travel to the suburbs
to reach their jobs.
"While some (Detroiters) have
cars," he said, "many of them
probably do not and it's why
people have to get up two hours
before and leave on a bus two
hours before to get to where their
job starts."
But investing in public transit
to fix these issues is easier said
than done, especially in light of
the city's bankruptcy. What kind
of transit? Light rail? Heavy rail?
Bus? Bus Rapid Trpnsit? Street-

car? These are all options that
Detroit continues to explore.
The M-1 Rail has been one of
the largest projects of the last
five years. It began in 2008 as
a privately funded three-mile
streetcar running along Wood-
ward Avenue to accommodate
Super Bowl XL, and to stimulate
economic growth, but the project
was delayed and then expanded,
with vision of a faster Light Rail
Transit system stretching nine
miles to 8 Mile Road to allow for
easy commuting in and out of
the city. But the project proved
infeasible despite receiving a
$25 million grant from the fed-
eral government in 2009 because
Detroit still did not have the funds
to complete the project. In 2011, a
slower 3.3-mile streetcar system
was proposed in place of the Light
Rail and expects to break ground
this spring.
Despite its past failures, there's
also been talk of re-expanding the
project out to 8 Mile once again.
Critics have been quick to point
out that streetcars are slow, and
are better used for making fre-
quent stops in condensed areas.
To go all the way to 8 Mile, cov-
ering long stretches where almost
nobody would want to get off -
even with increased urban den-
sity - seems impractical.
"The M-1 Rail is a piece of a
plan," Duggan said. "Ultimately,
we need to build a rail line out to
8 Mile and out to Pontiac. But we
also need to support it with fre-
quent buses that run on time and
when you put those pieces togeth-
er, you have a real transit system."
According to Grengs, Detroit
has never had a "real" transit sys-
tem - one that comprises those
multiple modes of transportation,
operates on a regional level and is
controlled under one organization
that helps them interconnect.
"Everywhere else in the coun-
try, there's an authority that ties
all of (these modes of transporta-
tion) together" he said. "We don't.
We don't have that. We never have.
We've tried decade after decade
after decade ... (Cleveland) estab-
lished one in the late '70s and even
that was a little bit late. Here we
are all these decades later and we
can't get this together."
Duggan denied that these
repeated failures in the past could
come from institutional pressures
from competing industries in
the area like the Big Three auto-
makers. Instead, he agreed with
Grengs.
"The issue is that we've had a
lack of coordination between city
and transit for 40 years." he said.

to the doctor's office.
"We see a lot of high blood pressure and dia-
betes," said Julie Weber, a second year Wayne
State Medical School student. "What's really
great about this clinic is that the people who we
see who have those conditions come back every
month and we give them free meds and it's awe-
some because we're actually managing their
conditions."
Oliver was waiting outside because every Sat-
urday morning at 9 a.m., the Cass Community
Social Services building, located in the Cass cor-
ridor in downtown Detroit, becomes Cass Clin-
ic - a free clinic run by Wayne State School of
Medicine students.
"Especially in your first and second year (of
medical school) you don't have any exposure
to the clinic, you don't ever really get to see
patients," Weber, who is one of the six student
coordinators of the clinic, said. "That's why I
love coming here, because it's really juststudents
treating patients and you do your best,"
"(The patients) know they're seeing students,
but it's better than nothing because they don't
really have access to doctors and we have a doc-
tor here, he just doesn't necessarily come out to
see patients," she added.
Two weeksbefore, Oliver came to Cass for the
first time. While he was there for a foot injury
he was informed of his high blood pressure and
became concerned. He came back to the clinic in
order to continue monitoring it.
"I'm kind of in the shelter, so I got dropped
off (in a van) and I just came over so I could
see somebody and to have my blood pressure
checked," Oliver said. "Just last week I turned a

e them as much as possible from
here."
the Clinic was given a very small
pare ithin the church - which still stands
aoss the street from the social services build-
ing. But with the Clinic's increasing popularity,
once the church purchased the social services
building in the late 1990s, the Clinic was given
that space to use every Saturday morning.
"A lot of the people we see, we're their prima-
ry caregiver," Costea said. "We've been able to, I
think, manage a number of people and hopefully
keep them from going to the emergency room for
routine care."
In 1990, shortly before the clinic relocated
across the street, the Wayne State University
School of Medicine formed a partnership with
Cass. Now six Wayne State School of Medicine
students, each of whom serves as a coordinator
ofvarious departments, including finance, dona-
tions and scheduling, run the Clinic. Costea still
serves as the overseeing physician.
Each Saturday, medical and undergradu-
ate student volunteers populate square tables
in the largest room of the social services build-
ing. Working in groups of two to four, the stu-
dent volunteers serve the patients who make up
the extended line outside. They evaluate each
patient for symptoms and take note of their con-
cerns, and then present their cases to Costea,
who sits in the back room where the prescrip-
tion medications are held and determines what
patients need.
"We do all the assess-
ments (in the main room),
we take their blood pres-
sure and listen to their
heart and lungs and then
we go back and do a pre-
sentation for the doc-
tor, which is good for us
because we learn how
to present in real-time
setting and the doctor
is hearing all about the
patient, so he can give an
informed decision about
how to treat the patient,"
Weber said. "A lot of the
time since he's been here
so long he has a sense of
how people should be
treated even if he hasn't
seen them but a lot of
them he recognizes and
he knows how to treat
and he can adjust the regi-
mens as needed."
Kathryn Rice, the clin-
ic's volunteer resources
coordinator, said Cass is
unique in that the stu-

dents have significant interactions with the
patients that they don't often get in other clinic
settings.
"You get to see firsthand what you're doing,"
Rice said. "It's not that you're just giving them
medication and you're walking away; you're
actually getting their history, you'retalking with
them you're getting to know them and it builds
rapport with the community, and it gives you a
sense of what you can do as a doctor."
Insurancenot accepted here
Perhaps the most impressive part of this
clinic is not its long standing history or that
it's student-run, but rather that in an era of ris-
ing healthcare costs, Cass functions at virtu-
ally no cost - all of the students and physicians
are volunteers and most of the medications are
donated.
Neha Meta, a first year Wayne State Univer-
sity School of Medicine student and the finance
coordinator for the clinic, estimated that each
year they receive about $20,000 in grant money,
which she said they mainly use to purchase
medications, like insulin, which they have not
been able to get through donations.
Rice said each Saturday the clinic serves 30 to
40 patients while it's open from 9 a.m. to noon.
According to Consumer Reports, an average
retail clinic - which Consumer Reports deems
as the lowest priced clinic compared to Urgent
Care centers and Emergency Rooms - charges
on average from $55 to $75 per visit, thus, doing
the simple math, that means a clinic like Cass,

were they collecting fees for their services,
would receive at least $85,800 each year.
As aresult, the clinic sometimes can't provide
necessary medications for patients due to the
high cost of a drug and lack of donations, so the
students and Costea have to make recommenda-
tions for the patient to go elsewhere.
"The hardest part is when you can't help
someone," Rice said. "You want to so badly
because you know that you need it but you don't
always have the resources to help them."
