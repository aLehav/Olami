CRIME

After a third-degree sexual 

assault in South Quad Residence 
Hall 
at 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan 
was 
alerted 
last 

Friday, some residents were 
concerned about the two-day 
delay in the crime alert. The 
assault, which took place on 
March 27 and was reported 
to DPSS on April 4, was not 
reported to the entire student 
body via a crime alert until 3:40 
p.m. on April 6.

LSA 
freshman 
Cassandra 

Ritter, a South Quad resident, 
said she was confused as to why 
the crime alert was delayed 
seeing as though it impacted the 
immediate safety of residents.

“I took issue with the fact 

that this incident was reported 
on April 4th, and we didn’t get 
any notification about it until the 
6th, and all of (the previous DPSS 
crime alerts) were reported a 
couple of hours after, and some 
of them even an hour after,” 
Ritter said. “I don’t understand 

why this incident, they didn’t 
let us know until two days after, 
even though this is something 
that directly affects us because it 
happened in our dorms.”

Melissa Overton, University 

deputy chief of police, said 
the delay was due to lack of 
information from the initial 
report and could not be avoided.

“We had to do some further 

investigation 
based 
on 
the 

original information we had,” 
Overton said. “We were trying to 
determine exact location, things 
like that. It just depends on 
what’s originally reported to us.”

According to Overton, this 

was not due to doubt of the 
victim’s account but to ensure 
the accuracy of the crime alert.

“The way we evaluate (a 

case) for a crime alert is we 
determine at the time, with all 
the information that we have, 
whether or not we deem it to be 
a public safety threat,” Overton 
said. 

Crime alert 
delay due to 
detail issues,

Sandra Levitsky talks power of 
optimism at Golden Apple lecture

Sociology professor Sandra Levitsky, recipient of the 2018 Golden Apple Award, gives her ‘last lecture’ on “Sociology and the Political Power of Optimism” at the 
Golden Apple Awards ceremony in Rackham Auditorim Monday.

Award-winning prof. says social change occurs through examination of status quo

In her last lecture, Sandra 

Levitsky, an associate professor 
in the Sociology Department, 
presented “Sociology and the 
Political Power of Optimism.” 
That 
is, 
the 
topic 
outlined 

her “ideal last lecture” — an 
annual event held Monday evening 
for this year’s Golden Apple 
Award Ceremony and recipient, 
Levitsky. 

Levitsky is the 28th recipient of 

the prestigious, student-selected 
faculty award and was chosen out 
of nearly 700 nominees. Each year, 
the Golden Apple Award Ceremony 
offers the honoree an opportunity 
to present their “last lecture” to 
students and other individuals 
who appreciate their work. Along 
with her lecture, attended by over 
a hundred University of Michigan 
community members in Rackham 
Auditorium, Levitsky also decided 
to donate to the American Civil 
Liberties Union.

Before Levitsky took the stage, 

LSA junior Kyle Riebock, Golden 

Apple Award Committee president, 
welcomed the audience and spoke 
to the quality of Levitsky’s role 
as a professor and as a mentor 
for students at the University. 
Riebock also noted her work 
with Sociology Opportunities for 
Undergraduate Leaders, which 
helps 
first-generation 
students 

academically and professionally, 
and her research on various social 
issues.

“Professor Levitsky is truly a 

wonderful example of a professor 
deserving of this award,” Riebock 
said. 
“When 
the 
committee 

surprised her, I was really able to 
hear a lot of heartfelt sentiments 
from her student and peers that 
truly moved me … Her research 
investigating social needs and 
inequality is truly inspiring and 
impactful.”

Riebock also praised the legacy 

Levitsky has created so far and 
expressed his desire to follow in 
her footsteps.

“As a future teacher myself, if 

my legacy inside and outside of the 
classroom can amount to even half 
of the legacy Professor Levitsky

A Black LSA sophomore 

has to think twice before any 
decision they make: once as 
an individual, and again as a 
member of the Black community. 
For this reason, the subject of 
this interview requested his 
name not be used in this article. 
He has to consider the impact of 
his words on how people view 
him as a Black person, he said.

“I have to be mindful that 

I’m a student, but I’m also Black 
here,” he said. “Sometimes the 
intersection of that, it becomes 
a double workload. So, a lot of 
times I feel uncomfortable even 
voicing my opinion on certain 
things because I don’t want to 
be perceived as a radical, or 
against white people.”

This idea of living a double 

life, or as this student put it, 
“thinking with your regular 
eyes and with the mind of a Black 
person as well,” is encapsulated 
in activist W. E. B. Du Bois’s 
term “double consciousness.” 
According to the sophomore, 
this 
double-consciousness 

permeates every aspect of his 
life, even in something as simple 
as a white female student asking 
to call an Uber from his phone 
when he was with his friends at 
a Black fraternity house.

“I had to think consciously 

about it,” he said. “I had to think 
with two minds. I want to help 
her, so I’m going to allow you to 
order the Uber from my phone, 

but I also have to keep in mind 
that if you’re in this house with 
a lot of Black men, you could 
try to flip this into something 
that completely did not happen 
because you’re drunk, and they 
would 
believe 
you 
because 

you’re a drunk white woman 
and we’re Black men.” 

This caution, this obligation 

to constantly think about one’s 
race and these ways of thinking 
are shared by many members 

of the Black community at the 
University of Michigan. Early 
experiences of racism created 
them, 
and 
the 
continued 

racism they experience at the 
University engrain them deeper 
in Black students’ minds.

Large-scale, 
more 

publicized racist incidents have 
plagued 
and 
continue 
to 

plague 
the 
University, 
the 

most 
recent 
one 
being 
a 

student posting a blackface 

Snapchat 
mocking 
the 

#BlackLivesMatter movement. 
50 years after the first Black 
Action 
Movement 
began 

with students taking over the 
Fleming 
Building 
following 

the 
assasination 
of 
Martin 

Luther King, Jr., racism still 
pervades in social interactions, 
in classrooms, at parties, on the 
street and more.

More than a dozen Detroit 

high schoolers descended on 
the University of Michigan’s 
campus Monday afternoon for 
more than an average Campus 
Day tour. Members of PILOT, 
a 
student 
organization 
that 

works with first-generation and 
underrepresented 
students, 

showed the prospective students 
around 
campus 
on 
Monday 

as 
part 
of 
Dreams2Reality, 

an 
event 
offering 
college 

planning 
assistance 
and 

empowerment to high school 
freshmen and sophomores from 
underrepresented 
minority 

backgrounds.

LSA 
freshman 
Ihunanya 

Muruako is PILOT’s financial 
director and a Dreams2Reality 
committee member. She said 
one of the goals of the program 
is helping the students learn 
more about social justice while 
helping them “get accustomed to 
college.”

“We just hope that a lot of 

the conversations that we have 
are more in-depth and get them 
thinking 
about 
themselves,”

On 
Monday 
morning, 
the 

names of 1,000 men, women and 
children who have been killed 
in Syria by President Bashar 
al-Assad’s regime were written 
in chalk across the Diag at the 
University of Michigan. These 
represented only a fraction of 
the more than 400,000 Syrians 
who have been killed during 
the conflict, now in its eighth 
year. While the demonstration 
was motivated by the conflict in 
general, the chemical attack in 
Douma, Syria on Sunday was 
a call to action according to 
LSA freshman Basil Alsubee, 
who 
participated 
in 
the 

demonstration.

“It is a response to the overall 

situation for the past couple 
years, but I think that what 
happened 
on 
Sunday 
really 

triggered this sense of, ‘We 
have to demonstrate,’” Alsubee 
said. “Sometimes we get a little 
complicit, and we start taking it 
for granted that humanitarian 
crises that are happening abroad 
are just going to happen.

Sticking 
with 

the 
theme 
of 
fours 
in 
 

University 
of 
Michigan 

athletics, 
all 
four 
of 
the 

University’s student nominees 
received 
the 
Goldwater 

Scholarship for the first time 
since 
2002. 
The 
Goldwater 

Scholarship is a top award for 
students 
pursuing 
graduate 

careers in STEM, providing 
recipients with up to $7,500 
in scholarship funds for their 
graduate studies.

Henry Dyson, director of the 

Office of National Scholarships 
and Fellowships, said in an email 
interview the University was 
one of three schools where all 
nominees won the award, along 
with Northeastern University 
and the University of Maryland. 
Dyson said the University ranks 
eighth in total students, tied 
with Kansas State, with 74 total 
scholarship recipients since the 
scholarship’s inception.

The process for the Goldwater 

Scholarship requires a University 
nomination, and each school 
is limited to four nominees. 
Dyson said this year ONSF 
received 16 applications for four 
nominations. The nominees had 

an average grade point average 
of 3.9 and significant research 
experience.

“It’s typically one of the 

most competitive nomination 
processes that ONSF runs each 
year,” Dyson wrote. “This was 
one of the strongest applicant 
pools we’ve had in some time.”

The 
University 
also 
had 

multiple seniors and graduate 
students receive the similar 
National Science Foundation’s 
Graduate Research Fellowships 
Program awards. The GRFP 
provides recipients with a three-
year stipend for educational and 
research opportunities. Dyson 
said he sees overlap between the 

students who apply for both 
opportunities.

“Every year when I look 

at the recipients for the 
NSF-GRFP, I recognize the 
many names of students who 
applied for the Goldwater 
Scholarship,” Dyson wrote. 
“Many of these applicants 
were not nominated for 
Goldwater, but did go on 
to receive the NSF-GRFP 
in senior year or as first or 
second-year PhD students. 
So I would not want the 
competitiveness 
of 
the 

Goldwater 
nomination 

process to dissuade students 
from applying.”

Dyson 
credits 
the 

success of the nominees to 
undergraduate 
research 

at the University. He said 
many applicants begin their 
research 
careers 
in 
the 

Undergraduate 
Research 

Opportunity 
Program 
as 

underclassmen. He said some 
students make substantive 
contributions to research 
and have often authored or 
co-authored 
publications. 

Another 
feature 
of 
the 

recipients is their completion of 
summer research opportunities 
at funded programs around the 
country.

“Our Goldwater and NSF-

GRFP recipients speak to the 
incredibly strong culture of 
undergraduate research that we 
have at UM,” Dyson wrote. “This 
is truly one of the strongest 
parts 
of 
our 
undergraduate 

education.”

LSA senior Tali Khain, one 

of the winners of the Goldwater 
Scholarship, has been involved 
in research since her freshman 
year. She currently works with 
Prof. David Gerdes on a solar 
system project in the Physics 
Department studying objects 
beyond Neptune’s orbit in a 
region called the Kuiper belt.

“Last 
summer 
I 
was 
at 

CalTech (California Institute 
of Technology) working with 
professors 
who 
think 
there 

might be another planet in our 
solar system,” Khain said. “It’s 
called the Planet 9 hypothesis 
and they think there might be 
another planet based on these 
Kuiper belt objects. It’s really 
cool that we are able to model 
objects that are so far away and 
use them as indirect evidence for 
an undiscovered planet in our 
solar system.”

Khain said she hopes to use 

the 
Goldwater 
Scholarship 

to go to graduate school for 
physics and continue to work in 
astrophysics.

“(Receiving the scholarship) 

is extremely exciting,” Khain 
said. “I’ve been working towards 
this for a very long time and I am 
honored to have gotten it.”

Entering the University
LSA freshman Brian Hicks 

moved around a lot growing up 
with his father in the military. 
From Virginia to Panama to 
Germany, he has little recollection 
of encounters with racism, if 
there were any at all, early on in 
life. His first experience with it 
was when his family moved to a 
majority-white suburb in Iowa.

“I was in ninth or 10th grade 

and I was riding my bicycle from 
my friend’s house; it was like, eight 
at night,” Hicks said. “That’s why 
my mom is super overprotective, 
because you really have to be 
when you’re Black and you live in 
the area we live in. This car with 
three white dudes pulled up, they 
lowered their window, and they 
screamed the ‘n-word’ at me.”

Other 
students 
expressed 

experiences with teachers or 
friends making microaggressions 
or 
tensions 
with 
neighbors 

toward their families. And still, 
others reported practically no 
experiences with racism, due to 
growing up in predominantly 
Black 
neighborhoods. 
LSA 

sophomore Carlena Toombs grew 
up in Detroit and Southfield.

“I wouldn’t say I experienced 

racism,” Toombs said. “I was 
always around my people. In 
Detroit, I was surrounded by 
Black people most of the time. In 
Southfield, even though it was a 
suburban area, my community 
was predominantly Black.”

LSA junior Kayla McKinney 

also grew up in Southfield and 
said when race was discussed, it 
was more about celebrating her 
Black culture.

“Race wasn’t really talked 

about,” McKinney said. “We 
talked about in a sense of 

celebrating our history and our 
culture, but not in a sense that 
there was any negative thing to 
worry about.”

For these students especially 

and coming from places with 
large Black communities entering 
the University, with only 4.96 
percent of the student body being 
Black, can be a shock. McKinney 
said 
entering 
the 
University 

freshman year, there’s always 
some sort of incident making 
Black students feel isolated.

“What’s funny is that as a Black 

person freshman year, something 
lets you know, ‘oh this campus 
is racist,’” McKinney said. “Me 
in particular, my instance was 
we had this UMich 2019 chat. It 
was filled with a whole bunch of 
people and then one day someone 
just kicked out all the Black 
people.”

LSA freshman Dylan Gilbert 

experienced this shock even 
though she comes from Ann 
Arbor, which is often perceived 
as more liberal and welcoming. 
Gilbert wrote an article detailing 
racism she experienced as soon 
as she entered the University. At 
her first football game, she and 
her friends asked a group of white 
students to pet their dog, only to 
be met with a gesture to Gilbert 
and the response, “If I can pet 
yours.” Gilbert said she did not 
experience this type of racism 
growing up in Ann Arbor.

Having to constantly consider 

race on campus can be exhausting, 
LSA senior Damaris Doss said. 
She expressed the relief that 
comes with being back with her 
own community in Detroit.

“Race is talked about a lot 

here,” Doss said. “And when I’m 
back home, it’s not talked about 
in the same manner that it is 
here. It’s something I don’t have 
to think about all the time. When 
I’m on campus, I’m constantly 

thinking about what other people 
are thinking of me, I’m afraid if I 
don’t do a reading that people are 
going to question if I’m smart. I 
remember just being back home 
in Detroit just sitting on a bus, 
or walking down the street, and 
I feel so relieved after an entire 
semester of being under that 
pressure.”

In 
Classrooms 
and 

Conversation

“Being one of the only Black 

students in the classroom has 
happened to me probably every 
semester,” Doss said.

This was an experience shared 

by all of the Black students 
interviewed. 
LSA 
sophomore 

Pascal Casimier said when this 
happens with him, he feels 
more comfortable when it is 
not addressed. He doesn’t want 
people to ask him to speak 
on behalf of the whole Black 
community.

“I feel like in my experience, 

a lot of the time it’s better to 
not bring up the elephant in the 
room,” Casimier said. “In groups 
I’m a part of when I’m often the 
only Black person there, when 
they acknowledge the fact that 
I’m the only Black person, that’s 
when I feel on the outside of a 
group.”

But, even if their Blackness 

wasn’t explicitly addressed, many 
students felt the effect of their 
race on teachers’ and students’ 
interactions with them. Gilbert 
reported one of her teachers 
continuously 
standing 
behind 

her and touching her hair during 
class. Toombs said a GSI once 
refused to answer her question in 
office hours, though he answered 
every white person whose hand 
was 
raised. 
LSA 
sophomore 

Sydni Warner said she was once 
rejected by students when she 
asked to join their group project.

“We were supposed to do a 

group work, and I asked to join 
a group and they just straight up 
told me no,” Warner said. “Didn’t 
give me a reason, didn’t give me 
any type of explanation.”

Toombs 
attributes 
this 

avoidance of Black students to 
fear.

“What I notice, and a lot of my 

friends notice is people avoid us 
more so than approaching us,” 
Toombs said. “Like do you want 
to pick me to be your partner in 
class. Or if you look uneasy when 
I’m walking past you. I notice 
people tend to be more afraid of 
us, and the only time they really 
have anything to say is when 
they’re under an influence or 
they’re with their friends.”

Other times, though, Hicks 

observed how comfortable people 
are approaching him and talking 
to him about his experiences and 
being Black.

“People have come up to me 

and if they have some story that 
has to do with Black people, they 
feel like it’s cool to come up to me 
and tell me about how it is being 
Black,” Hicks said.

Another assumption people feel 

comfortable making is that Black 
students are at the University as 
athletes. Warner said when she 
lived in South Quad Residence 
Hall last year, she was constantly 
asked if she was an athlete. The 
anonymous LSA sophomore said 
he was at BTB Burrito recently 
when a white woman asked him 
if he played on the football team. 
Toombs observed Black athletes 
are respected by white people in 
a way that does not translate to 
other Black students.

“It’s funny, white people will 

treat Black people like they’re 
nothing unless the Black person 
is on a sports team,” Toombs said. 
“Regular Black man or woman, 
your opinion doesn’t matter, if 
you sit down in class, I won’t sit 

next to you, I don’t want to be 
your partner. Any Black athlete, 
they’re honestly kissing ass.”

In general, these students said 

they are made to feel they don’t 
belong at the University, or they 
didn’t earn their acceptances 
through 
their 
own 
efforts 

or 
intelligence. 
Warner 
said 

people have told her she was 
only accepted to the University 
because of affirmative action — 
something the University does 
not use. Hicks said he still is 
met with surprise when he tells 
people he attends the University.

“When I got into U-M, anytime 

someone found out in my high 
school that I knew was a bigot, 
they would act all surprised,” 
Hicks said. “To this day, people 
are like ‘Oh you go to Michigan?’ 
because I’m a Black man, that’s 
something I’ve had to deal with.”

At Parties
Gilbert 
attended 
fraternity 

parties earlier this year, just 
trying to relax and have fun 
with her friends. But she found 
fraternity members and other 
white male partygoers reacted 
to her presence with hateful, 
racist behaviors. She said males 
would mimic animal noises in 
her direction, pull her hair while 
dancing with her or lock eyes with 
her while shouting the “n-word” 
in songs. In her article, she wrote 
about a student asking to dance 
with her. When she declined, he 
responded, “Fine, I don’t like n---
ers anyway.”

“I feel white men are at this 

weird point of fetishizing me but 
also hating me, and that comes 
out a lot at frat parties,” Gilbert 
said. “Which is why I don’t go to 
white frat parties anymore. It’s 
either 
them 
hypersexualizing 

me or being blatantly aggressive 
toward me, or both.”

Other 
students 
described 

similar behavior, if at times less 

extreme. Warner said she feels 
male students avoid her at parties 
and has noticed white fraternity 
brothers trying to hook her up 
with the only other Black people 
in the room. At other times, 
though, she found herself being 
fetishized with comments like, 
“I’ve never hooked up with a 
Black girl before.”

Fraternities 
already 
have 

a history of being involved 
with high numbers of sexual 
misconduct cases, one of the 
reasons for their shutdown last 
semester, and the fetishizing of 
Black women make this issue 
even more prevalent for them. 
LSA junior Joy Boakye expressed 
the difficulties associated with 
being a Black woman.

“Identifying as a Black woman 

is honestly its own double-edged 
sword, because the experiences 
of Black men are very different, 
and the experiences of non-
Black women are very different,” 
Boakye said. “It’s a thing of being 
fetishized and hypersexualized, 
but also, statistically, receiving 
the least romantic interest of 
all racial groups for women. 
It’s really just a shit show, to be 
honest, being a black woman.”

Though 
Black 
women 
especially 

are targeted at fraternity parties, 
all Black student interviewees 
reported feeling unwelcome. The 
anonymous LSA sophomore said 
during his freshman year, he 
and his friends tried to get into a 
fraternity party but were told to 
wait off to the side. After waiting 
over an hour while others entered 
the party, they left. McKinney 
said she was told by older Black 
students not to attend white 
fraternity parties for this reason.

Muruako said.

Muruako got involved with 

PILOT through the Big House 
Program, which helps selected 
prospective 
students 
from 

underrepresented backgrounds 
navigate 
the 
University’s 

undergraduate 
application 

process.

“We 
hope 
they 
get 

more 
comfortable 
having 

conversations regarding social 
justice so that they’re able to 
bridge the gap within their 
communities because Detroit is a 
very segregated place,” Muruako 
said. “A lot of Arab people live in 
Dearborn, a lot of Latinx people 
are in southwest Detroit and 
Black people are throughout 
the city, so we hope that these 
communities 
come 
together 

rather than just staying in their 
own areas.”

Attendee Jennifer Penaloza 

is a sophomore at Detroit Cristo 
Rey High School. Having never 
visited the University before, 
Penaloza said she enjoyed the 
campus, and the social justice 
aspect 
of 
Dreams2Reality 

appealed to her.

“I just joined it because I was 

interested in the social justice 
part of it,” Penaloza said. “I 

thought it would be cool to go and 
talk about that stuff with other 
people who are interested in it as 
well.”

Keynote 
speaker 
Shawn 

Blanchard, a Detroit native and 
a University alum, talked to the 
group after their campus tour 
about achieving financial success.

“Who 
wants 
to 
be 
a 

millionaire?” 
he 
asked 
the 

students. Everyone, including the 
PILOT volunteers, raised their 
hands. The average millionaire, 
he told them, has seven streams 
of income.

Blanchard said he has six 

streams of income, as an author, 
the style adviser of a suit 
company, a motivational speaker, 
a proprietor of online courses 
for aspiring writers, the owner 
of a publishing company and the 
founder of a fitness movement, 
Run This Town/Networkingout.

“So if I ask you what you want 

to be, sometimes we can raise our 
hand and say one thing, but I’ll 
tell you guys this — that doesn’t 
have to limit you,” Blanchard 
said. “I’ll tell you guys, you guys 
can do anything you want to, and 
not only can you do anything you 
want to, it doesn’t matter where 
you’re from either.”

Blanchard said his mother 

often had drugs in her system 
while she was pregnant with 
him, and of his seven brothers, 

Blanchard 
said, 
three 
have 

passed away and three are 
incarcerated. Even as a student at 
the University, Blanchard said he 
was “very non-traditional.”

“I had to raise my younger 

brother myself,” Blanchard said. 
“I actually brought him up here 
to the University of Michigan, 
once he got out of juvenile, that 
is. I was here at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
working 
three 

jobs, raising a younger brother, 
had a girlfriend living with me, 
majoring in mathematics and 
economics … Just like I have 
multiple streams of income now, 
I had multiple issues that I had to 
work through.”

After graduating in 2005, 

Blanchard moved to New York 
City, earned a master’s degree in 
secondary math education and 
founded a mentorship program 
for young men.He later moved 
back to Detroit and Mayor Mike 
Duggan appointed him director 
of Youth Services in 2014. In the 
role, Blanchard oversaw youth 
initiatives 
and 
worked 
with 

local businesses to created 5,600 
summer jobs for young people 
in the city. Blanchard has since 
received former President Barack 
Obama’s Volunteer Community 
Service Award and been profiled 
by CNN.

“That means no matter what 

you’re going through, wherever 

you’re from, whatever is going 
on at home, at the end of the day 
you can do anything, and as I’m 
standing here right before you 
right now, that’s proof of doing 
it,” Blanchard said. “And as you 
guys are sitting here right in this 
room right now, that’s proof that 
you guys can do it, too.”

Student 
organizations 

have been on the vanguard of 
pipelining high schoolers from 
underrepresented backgrounds 
to the University. While the Go 
Blue Guarantee focuses on class 
disparities 
with 
guaranteed 

tuition 
and 
progrmas 
like 

Wolverine 
Pathways 
target 

specific school districts, PILOT’s 
programming 
intentionally 

recruits students of color, but 
from all over the Midwest. 

LSA 
senior 
Antonio 

Gallegos told The Daily last 
August 
the 
program 
was 

instrumental 
in 
closing 

culturally-specific 
information 

gaps.

“I didn’t even really think 

Michigan 
was 
a 
possibility 

for me,” he said. I’m a first 
generation student so I didn’t 
know anything. The Big House 
really gave me the resources 
necessary to apply and not only 
apply, but once I came here even 
at my orientation people within 
PILOT, the student organization, 
were reaching out to me.”

enzymes to perform chemical 
reactions. 
She 
said 
this 

biocatalysis knowledge could 
offer a more sustainable method 
of performing experiments. Suh 
also worked in a biochemistry 
lab researching and examining 
how microorganisms in the gut 
impact human health.

Suh 
said 
she 
hopes 
the 

scholarship 
will 
allow 
her 

to focus on her research in 
graduate school. She hopes to 
earn her doctorate in organic 
chemistry and go into academia 
and research.

“I feel incredibly honored,” 

Suh said. “It’s an amazing 
opportunity and a prestigious 
title to hold … I feel really 
thankful to my lab members and 
all of those who have supported 
me and the University which 
has provided me with so many 
research opportunities.”

LSA junior Noah McNeal, 

a scholarship recipient, works 
with 
high 
energy 
particle 

physics and filling in the gaps of 
the Standard Model of physics. 
He is studying in the KOTO Lab, 
working specifically in the decay 
of kaon particles.

“The 
problems 
we 
want 

to solve in physics are tough 

questions that we don’t have any 
answers to,” McNeal said. “They 
are fundamental and concern 
why we exist, how we exist and 
how this universe is piece-by-
piece; we can understand the 
fuller picture.”

McNeal began his research as 

a freshman in UROP and hopes 
to continue working with the 
lab and write a thesis. He plans 
to go to graduate school to study 
physics and go into a career as a 
physics researcher.

McNeal said he has spent 

a long time working on this 
application for the Goldwater 
Scholarship and has learned 
more about himself and his 
career path through this process.

“I am elated,” McNeal said. 

“I have been working on it all of 
fall semester so getting to this 
point was something that … has 
been incredibly rewarding. The 
inward thinking I’ve done and 
the introspective thinking about 
my future and my career goals 
has been invigorating and I feel 
that I am on a career path and 
line of work that suits me.”

Engineering 
senior 
Eric 

Winsor, the fourth recipient, 
won the scholarship for his 
work in mathematics. According 
to 
Dyson, 
the 
Mathematics 

Department has had at least one 
Goldwater Scholarship recipient 
every year since 2002.

But the attack on Douma 

was in a way kind of a wake-up 
call, a reminder that we have a 
responsibility, so it definitely 
motivated this protest.”

Rackham 
student 
Nusayba 

Tabbah, one of the organizers of 
the event, agreed with Alsubee 
that 
complicity 
is 
an 
issue, 

especially when a conflict has 
been going on for a long time.

“Even last year, there were 

chemical attacks on civilians, and 
for a while, people acted outraged, 
but eventually nobody cared,” 
Tabbah said. “I kind of felt like it 
was a cycle, and when I saw it on 
the news again yesterday, I felt 
helpless feeling like I couldn’t do 
anything about it.”

In an attempt to combat this 

feeling of helplessness, Tabbah 
said she and a few friends got 
together to bring the conflict 
back to the forefront through the 
action. By putting the names on 
the Diag, she hoped to humanize 
the conflict again and make people 
realize real lives were being lost.

Alsubee hoped by writing the 

names on the ground in the Diag, 

students would recognize as they 
went through their mundane 
tasks, they were stepping on the 
names of people who could no 
longer go through these types of 
mundane activities.

“There was an intended shock 

value that we were going for,” 
Alsubee said. “You’re on your 
way to class, you’re doing such a 
mundane activity and on your way 
there you’re stepping on names of 
people who died.”

LSA sophomore Layla Hak, 

who also participated in the 
demonstration, 
felt 
it 
was 

necessary to demonstrate in a 
public area to inspire people to 
take action.

“People don’t talk about it 

enough, so I think that if it’s in a 
very public arena, it will cause 
people to start talking and maybe 
take action,” Hak said. “It’s so 
easy to just donate and raise your 
voice about it.”

Alsubee said he thought the 

demonstration’s humanization of 
the statistics was important, and 
he felt it made it easier for him to 
relate to the victims, though the 
conflict is something he has been 
thinking about for a long time.

“A big part of why the idea 

specifically intrigued me was 

that it’s a lot more focused on the 
individual lives because we’re 
writing their names, and the idea 
that behind all of those names 
there are people who had lives and 
stories and passions and dreams, 
just like you and me,” Alsubee 
said. “All my life I’ve known about 
what’s happening in Syria, and all 
my life it has affected me a lot, but 
writing down those names, I was 
like ‘wow, a lot of those names 
resemble my name, and my name 
could’ve been down there.’”

However, at the same time, 

Alsubee said he found the students’ 
reception of the demonstration to 
be ironic, given that many people 
seemed to walk past with nothing 
more than a glance. 

“There’s kind of an irony to 

the fact that a lot of people didn’t 
care,” Alsubee said. “They just 
kept walking, or if anything 
they shot a small glance. A lot 
of people did care, they did ask 
what we were doing, and maybe 
they stopped in the center to read 
what those names were, but it’s a 
little ironic to me that people keep 
going through their mundane 
daily lives, while at the same time 
stepping on the names of people 
who weren’t capable of going 
through their daily lives.”

has created for herself, then my 
career will be more successful 
than I could ever imagine,” he 
said.

Levitsky began her lecture 

by 
discussing 
her 
journey 

to becoming a teacher. She 
explained 
how 
she 
initially 

disdained academia, but after 
pursuing a law degree, realized 
she enjoyed being in front 
of students and tackling big 
questions about social issues. 

While Levitsky recognized 

the difficulty of the subject, she 
also noted the power which 
could come from sociology.

“If you peel back all of the 

depression in sociology, our 
social science rests on a core of 
optimism, and I believe there 
is tremendous power in that 
optimism,” Levitsky said. “And 
I’m not talking about emotional 
power or psychological power, 
I’m talking about real political 
power.”

Levitsky 
gave 
two 

examples 
of 
ways 
audience 

members could study social 
change: 
understanding 
what 

drives a social problem and 
understanding the status quo. 
To look at an example of the 
former, 
Levitsky 
cited 
the 

racial inequalities against the 
Black community in regards to 
police drug searches and in the 
criminal justice system over the 
past 50 years.

“The criminalization of the 

African-American 
community 

is one area that has gotten 
worse over time, it hasn’t even 
stayed the same over the past 
half-century, 
it 
has 
gotten 

worse, and it is a particularly 
insidious problem because there 
is a self-reinforcing nature to it,” 
Levitsky said. “We know that 
racial stereotypes play a role 
in the criminalization of the 
Black community but locking 
up the Black community only 
contributes to the stereotype 
that Black people are criminals.”

To understand the influence 

of the status quo when looking 
at 
social 
change, 
Levitsky 

offered 
the 
instance 
of 

the #MeToomovement. While 
she acknowledged the impact of 
the recent activism, Levitsky also 
pointed out this was not the only 
time in U.S. history where sexual 
harassment issues have been 

brought to the national forefront. 
She also noted the common 
themes of powerful predators, 
and how fear of repercussions 
cause many survivors of sexual 
assault to remain silent.

“Through 
sociology, 
we 

know power works in different 
ways, and (in) many cases 
involving 
sexual 
misconduct 

and employment, power is based 
on dependence,” Levitsky said. 
“But there are other more subtle 
dimensions to power that are at 
work here too, and one of these is 
the capacity of power to silence 
people.”

According 
to 
Levitsky, 

sociology shows how silence 
maintain 
the 
status 
quo 

because it can cause persecuted 
individuals to withdraw from 
political and social spheres. 
She also said social change 
can occur when the status quo 
is disrupted, and highlighted 
some 
parallels 
between 

the #NeverAgain movement and 
the 1980’s Act-Up Movement — 
which she sees as one of the most 
concrete victories for activism.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

F

rom the ages of three 
to 17, dance was my 
“thing” — my 

primary 
after-

school activity, my 
source of exercise, 
my creative outlet. 
Though 
I 
never 

intended to dance 
professionally, 
my 

experiences with the 
discipline have had 
an enormous impact 
on me. I committed 
hours upon hours each week 
to ballet, tap, jazz and modern 
styles as a child and teenager.

While 
dance 
gave 
me 

strength, 
flexibility, 
balance, 

an artistic way to express 
myself, 
incredible 
memories 

and a powerful sense of focus, 
it also reinforced a mentality of 
perfectionism that I have since 
found hard to shake. And while 
dance isn’t completely to blame 
for these thought patterns in 
me, they have certainly gone 
hand in hand.

In ballet — which is often 

described as the foundation of 
all dance — you aim essentially 
to achieve perfection: perfect 
posture, perfect body placement 
and perfect lines. Dancers contort 
themselves 
into 
unnatural 

positions to create this illusion by 
turning their hips, legs and feet 
out, dancing “en pointe” (on their 
toes), etc. Though ballet demands 
an ideal nearly impossible to 
achieve, dancer training can act 
as a kind of journey to hover ever 
closer to that perfect, seemingly 
effortless performance.

Growing up, I would use 

my 
dance 
studio’s 
floor-to-

ceiling mirrors to examine the 
technical and physical minutiae 
of my positions and self-adjust 
constantly. 
Teachers 
would 

give 
constructive 
criticisms 

of dancers’ movements every 
few seconds and occasionally 
comment 
on 
our 
bodies. 

We’d rehearse each piece of 
choreography to death leading 
up to end-of-year performances 
and compete with one another 
for coveted lead roles.

Since 
coming 
to 
the 

University of Michigan, I’ve 
continued to pursue perfection, 
which had felt so salient in my 
years as a dancer. And I’ve noticed 
similar 
thought 
patterns 
of 

perfectionism, overachievement 

and competitiveness in many of 
my classmates. It seems natural 

in 
the 
environment 

here. 
Our 
role 
as 

college students at a 
top university asks 
us to constantly work 
toward high grades 
in our classes and 
involve ourselves in 
the 
“best” 
possible 

extracurricular 
activities, 
jobs 
and 

internships.

This 
forward-looking, 

overachieving approach is often 
thought of as an important 
component 
to 
developing 

perseverance, 
discipline 
and 

drive. The University implicitly 
encourages 
perfectionism 

through deeming its students 
the “Leaders and Best.” But 
I’ve found it difficult to sever 
my perfectionistic approach to 
my work from other aspects of 
my life — to put the cycles of 
self-critique that come with 
perfectionism on pause and 
just be.

I stopped dancing when 

I came to the University. I 
explored 
different 
interests, 

focused on academics and found 
my place on campus. Unlike 
in dance, I can’t measure my 
success in college by the height 
of my jumps or the precision of 
my turns — seeing my progress 
laid out in the mirror in front 
of me — but I still began to 
consistently judge my work in 
other ways, striving toward 
earning 
typical 
benchmarks 

of achievement like As and 
internships.

At the same time, in focusing 

on other aspects of my life, I 
wound up spending two years 
lacking 
a 
regular 
exercise 

routine, trying to squeeze in 
time for late-night visits to the 
gym 
and 
feeling 
completely 

disconnected from my body. On 
a whim the summer after my 
sophomore year of college, I 
bought an unlimited summer 
package at a yoga studio a 
few minutes away from my 
Chicago apartment.

And though I didn’t enter 

that studio intending to find 
anything more than a regular 
class schedule for workouts, 
practicing 
yoga 
seriously 

changed my relationship with 
myself. It helped me begin to 
unwind the years of conditioning 
that motivated me to sacrifice 
my well-being in pursuit of 
achievement. Since taking it up, 
I have not only been able to find 
strength, flexibility and most 
other benefits of dance, but I also 
surprised myself by creating a 
small space to shed my inclination 
to yearn for perfection.

The rooms of the studios 

where 
I’ve 
practiced 
are 

mirrorless. 
There’s 
no 

performance at the end of the 
year to look to. Movement 
is appreciated for the sake 
of movement and not for an 
audience. No one competes with 
you, and you don’t even compete 
with 
yourself. 
Process 
and 

presence are valued. Teachers 
correct you only to prevent 
injury or suggest a deeper 
expression of a pose. There’s no 
such thing as a perfect pose. You 
meet each class with what you 
have, and it’s enough.

Through yoga, I’ve sought 

a sense of daily presence and 
acceptance of things as they 
are. And while I get this feeling 
through 
exercise, 
I 
truly 

believe exploring any space 
and taking any regular time 
to cultivate acceptance of our 
present 
selves 
is 
absolutely 

paramount to success in college. 
Various facets of our lives may 
take unexpected twists and 
turns, and perfection doesn’t 
truly exist. In an environment 
where 
overachieving 
is 
the 

norm and where individual 
accomplishment is idealized, 
we must take time to separate 
our worth from our résumé and 
from our work.

The truth behind your sandwich

CARLI COSENZA | COLUMN

I

magine this. It’s lunchtime. 
You’ve just had a busy 
morning of class and now 

have an hour before 
your 
next 
lecture. 

Since you’re feeling 
hungry, you decide to 
walk to the Michigan 
Union 
to 
grab 
a 

bite to eat. Stomach 
grumbling, you head 
downstairs 
to 
the 

basement, which has 
a variety of fast-food 
options. You’re in the 
mood 
for 
chicken, 

which is perfect because there’s 
a Wendy’s right past the bottom 
of the stairs. You walk up to 
the register and place your 
order: a spicy chicken sandwich 
($4.69), 
medium-sized 
fries 

($1.99) and a small soft drink 
($1.69). The total amount that 
you pay for your meal adds up to 
approximately $8.37. Pleased by 
the low price and quick service, 
you walk away excited to eat, 
oblivious to the fact that the 
price you just paid for your meal 
is more than a worker’s daily 
wage at the farm where Wendy’s 
gets its tomatoes.

Two 
weeks 
ago, 
nearly 

100 
farmworkers 
and 
their 

allies held a protest in New 
York City outside the office of 
Trian Partners. Nelson Peltz is 
the chairman of the Wendy’s 
Board of Directors and CEO of 
Trian Partners, Wendy’s largest 
shareholder. 
The 
protesters 

stood outside Peltz’s office for 
five days, during which they 
fasted to call attention to the 
human rights abuses toward 
farmworkers that have been 
occurring for decades in the 
Wendy’s 
supply 
chain 
and 

protested the fact that Wendy’s 
hasn’t signed a binding Fair 
Food Agreement.

Wendy’s is one of the five 

major 
food 
corporations 
in 

the United States, along with 
fast 
food 
forerunners 
like 

McDonald’s and Burger King. 
On its website, the company 
boasts about its workers: “From 
our headquarters to the amazing 
employees in every location, 
we like to think of Wendy’s 
as a big family.” However, the 
reality of how Wendy’s treats 
its employees — specifically 
the farmworkers who produce 
the 
company’s 
supply 
of 

“hand-chopped tomatoes” — is 
astonishingly different. It is time 
that consumers boycott Wendy’s.

Now, 
imagine 
something 

different. You’re 14 years old, 
living in one of the poorest 
regions of southwestern Mexico. 
According 
to 
Mexican 
law, 

you’re too young to be employed. 
But the law doesn’t apply to 
you because the only thing 
that matters is that you are 
meeting quota. Who are you? 
You’re a farmworker in a labor 
camp for a company called 
Bioparques 
de 
Occidente, 

which 
is 
a 
major 
tomato 

grower. It produces as many as 
6 million boxes of tomatoes for 
the U.S. market each year and 
is also a supplier of tomatoes 

for Wendy’s. That’s right, the 
same tomatoes that are found 
on a spicy chicken sandwich.

As a farmworker 

in the labor camp, 
you 
sleep 
head-

to-toe with other 
workers on concrete 
floors. You’re forced 
to protect yourself 
from 
scorpions 

and bedbugs. Each 
morning, 
you 

receive a stack of 
tortillas 
that 
is 

supposed 
to 
last 

you throughout the day, which 
will be spent picking, sorting 
and carrying heavy buckets of 
tomatoes in 90-degree heat. 
You have to work quickly. If 
you don’t fill a minimum of 
60 buckets with tomatoes, 
then you will not receive 
your pay for the day, which is 
100 pesos, or the equivalent 
of approximately eight U.S. 
dollars. 
Conditions 
are 

miserable. You just want to 
be at home playing with your 
siblings. But you cannot stop 
working or attempt escape 
from the labor camp because 
you’re afraid of what your 
bosses will do to you. Last 
week, another field worker 
asked for extra tortillas for her 
children and was threatened 
with a slap from her boss. 
The memory — and fear from 
witnessing the threat — is still 
fresh in your mind.

These are the conditions 

that hundreds of farmworkers 
have been forced to live 
under for decades, as major 
American corporations like 
Wendy’s 
have 
outsourced 

their labor costs to camps 
like Bioparques de Occidente 
in other countries. In 2014, 
a federal investigation was 
launched against Bioparques 
de 
Occidente 
after 
a 

successful escapee reported 
the abusive conditions to 
authorities. 
The 
company 

was found to have violated 
health and labor laws and was 
ordered to pay a $700,000 
fine.

Once information from the 

investigation reached other 
field workers and farmers 
across North America, they 
decided to take action and 
form the Fair Foods Program, 
which is composed of farmers, 
farmworkers and retail food 
companies. 
The 
widely-

acclaimed, uniquely successful 
organization seeks to raise 
awareness about and provide 
humane wages and working 

conditions for farmworkers, 
along with giving them a 
representative voice. The FFP 
has received recognition from 
major organizations and its 
efforts were even recognized 
by the White House in 2013.

Today, 
the 
FFP 
has 

partnered with almost all 
of the major food retailers 
and fast food restaurants, 
including 
Chipotle, 
Burger 

King, Trader Joe’s, Subway 
and 
McDonalds. 
But 
not 

Wendy’s. In fact, in response 
to 
pressure 
to 
join 
the 

FFP, Wendy’s retaliated. It 
abandoned its longtime Florida 
tomato supplier and shifted its 
purchases to Bioparques in 
Mexico in support of a work 
environment 
derived 
from 

fear, violence and corruption. 
Furthermore, 
Wendy’s 

released a modified supplier 
code of conduct that contains 
“no 
effective 
mechanisms 

for 
worker 
participation 

or 
enforcement,” 
despite 

Bioparques’s proven history of 
human rights violations.

In October 2016, Wendy’s 

released 
a 
statement 

regarding 
its 
relationship 

with Bioparques: “We are 
quite happy with the quality 
and taste of the tomatoes we 
are sourcing from Mexico.” 
But what about the quality of 
life for the workers who picked 
the tomatoes with their bare 
hands so that consumers across 
the continent can enjoy a spicy 
chicken sandwich that costs the 
equivalent of a day’s salary?

Personally, I can’t eat a 

sandwich knowing that the 
process to make it consciously 
violates human rights law. I 
cannot eat tomatoes that were 
picked by the hands of an 
underage child in a labor camp 
that doesn’t even provide beds 
for its workers. Furthermore, 
I cannot support a company 
that knowingly perpetuates 
human rights abuses in order 
to have a cost advantage over 
its competitors. And I cannot 
support 
a 
company 
that’s 

board of directors has the 
information and power to end 
the violent conditions forced 
upon its farmworkers but 
refuses to take meaningful 
action to end it even though 
a viable solution (the FFP) is 
right at its fingertips.

The 
five-day 
fast 
in 

Manhattan was only a small 
fraction of the hunger pains 
felt by Wendy’s farmworkers 
at Bioparques de Occidente 
labor camp. But as consumers, 
we can make an impact too. If 
enough informed consumers 
boycott Wendy’s, then maybe 
the Board of Directors will 
be forced to acknowledge the 
inhumanity of their behavior. 
It is time for Wendy’s to 
follow through with its “big 
family” ideals. Until then, I 
boycott Wendy’s, and I think 
that the rest of us should too.

I can’t eat a sandwich 

knowing that the 
process to make it 
consciously violates 
human rights law. 

I can’t measure 
my success in 
college by the 
height of my 
jumps or the 

precision of my 

turns.

KARUNA NANDKUMAR | OP-ED

O

n March 24, University 
of Michigan students 
marched for their lives. 

In January 2017 and 2018, 
thousands of college students 
marched for the protection 
of their rights and diversity. 
Now, imagine if those 4 million 
citizens gathered throughout 
the country in protest had been 
gunned down.

This is essentially what 

occurred six years ago in 
Syria. The violent response to 
a peaceful 2011 uprising against 
President 
Bashar 
al-Assad 

spiraled into a civil war that 
has 
killed 
and 
displaced 

millions. The situation is not 
improving. On March 27, the 
U.N. Emergency Coordinator 
Mark Lowcock reported that 
“the last few months have 
been some of the worst yet 
for 
many 
civilians 
inside 

Syria.” The Syrian conflict 
displays a detrimental failure 
of international cooperation. 
However, the innovative use 
of international law will be 
necessary to achieve peace 
and reconciliation.

The past six years make 

it easy to become a cynic. 
Negotiations 
have 
been 

unsuccessful, 
because 
the 

rebels will not stop fighting 
until the seemingly impossible 
abdication 
of 
the 
Syrian 

government. To complicate the 
situation, major world powers 
have become involved. Russian 
interference has shifted the 
balance of power in favor of 
the government. The Syrian 
opposition, trained by the U.S. 
and Turkey, maintains faith 
that international law lies in 
their favor. The U.N. has, 
in fact, passed resolutions 
that “reiterate the need for 
political 
transition.” 
The 

question is whether we can 
overcome the bureaucracy of 
international law.

Both sides have committed 

war crimes and crimes against 
humanity, including torture, 
use of chemical weapons and 
violence 
against 
civilians. 

Human 
Rights 
Watch 
has 

collected enough evidence to 
ensure the delivery of justice in 
international tribunals. First, 
however, we must create these 
tribunals. In a perfect world, 
the U.S. or another power 
could submit the case to the 
International Criminal Court, 
but Syria is not a member of 
the ICC, and would probably 
not be willing to join anytime 
soon. The only body with the 
power to authorize the use of 
the ICC for a non-member state 
or create an ad hoc tribunal 
is the U.N. Security Council. 
When the UNSC referred the 
case to the ICC in 2014, the 
resolution was vetoed by Russia 
and China.

Though the situation seems 

hopeless, 
International 
Law 

Specialist Nicholas Koumjian 
would disagree. In his recent 
lecture 
at 
the 
University, 

Koumjian 
insisted 
upon 

the 
value 
of 
international 

justice, even if it comes at a 
slow pace and high economic 
cost. 
International 
justice 

has tangible benefits, such as 
satisfaction for the victims 
and 
deterrence 
of 
future 

crimes. Victims of the Bosnian 
genocide confirmed that the 
punishment of even a few guilty 
persons can restore a sense of 
the righteousness of the world.

We 
must 
renew 
the 

search for an international 
solution to the Syrian crisis. 
Every additional hour of war 
indicates 
increased 
human 

rights violations, U.S. dollars 
spent on airstrikes and refugees 
flooding the shores of Europe. 
Universal jurisdiction or the 
prosecution of Russia could 
provide short-term relief.

The principle of universal 

jurisdiction upholds the ideal 

that national courts charge 
individuals 
with 
crimes 

against international law. An 
uninvolved 
state, 
therefore, 

could 
potentially 
convict 

criminals fleeing the Syrian 
conflict. If the United States 
or another power was truly 
determined, it could also charge 
Russia, an ICC member, with 
involvement in international 
crimes. Russia recently lost its 
seat on the U.N. Human Rights 
Council. While these are both 
feasible options, realistically 
immense 
exterior 
pressure 

would be required to convince 
states to take actions that could 
jeopardize relationships with 
Russia and China.

No matter what occurs, 

it is imperative that a peace 
agreement outlines a framework 
for judicial proceedings that 
address perpetrators on both 
sides of the conflict. Bilateral 
tribunals will inevitably result 
in the removal of the Assad 
regime. 
Syrian 
survivors 

insist that peace cannot come 
without justice. The crimes 
of the regime are too broad 
to be ignored. International 
or 
hybrid 
courts 
should 

also 
operate 
close 
to 
the 

community to assist in the 
restorative process.

In the long-term, the UNSC 

should be reformed to prevent 
abuses of veto powers that 
impede the protection of human 
rights. 
The 
international 

legal system is still a work 
in 
progress. 
As 
Koumjian 

concluded, 
international 

justice is not perfect, but it’s 
better than nothing. In the 
case of Syria, it can make 
the difference between the 
continuation of a catastrophic 
conflict and the transition to a 
brighter future.

This weekend I sat in the 
library, rigorously trying to finish 
an essay. Music was playing, my 
feet were tapping and my fingers 
were frantically traveling back and 
forth between my mouth and the 
keyboard. I like to believe that if 
I don’t bite my nails while I write 
essays, I could probably get more 
words on the page. Yet no matter 
how conscious I try to be about 
my anxious habits, I still fall into 
them.
I try to hide my nails from 
everybody. Having large hands as 
it is, I’m extremely self-conscious 
when it comes to my hands and 
fingers. I’ve been a nail biter since 
I was a kid, and although it has 
gotten better over time — like 
attending hypnotherapy sessions 
and meditating to become more 
present and aware of my actions — 
I still abuse my nails at least once a 
day. Like most people with habits, 
I hate admitting this to myself and 
to the public.
Many people have anxious 
habits even when they don’t know 
it: teeth grinding, nail picking, 
pencil chewing. Although our 
minds are listening to lectures or 
reading our textbooks, there is 
our subconscious mind, sending 
us 
messages 
to 
mindlessly 
wander off into a long list of 
events, 
assignments, 
people, 
work, fears and more. When this 
happens, we’re probably worried 
or anxious about them, and when 
that stress builds, we have to 
transfer that energy somewhere. 
Sadly, we mainly transfer this 
energy to ourselves, where verbs 
like “grinding,” “picking” and 
“chewing” are used against our 
own bodies.
Some habits, however, can be 
completely innocent and safe, like 
tapping your foot or twirling your 
hair. But it’s important to highlight 

the more dangerous habits like nail 
baiting, binge cigarette smoking or 
eating and even dermatillomania, 
the act of skin picking. I’ve been 
that girl who has picked the one 
small bump on my face until it 
bleeds, and to be quite honest, I 
have no reason for it. Habits like 
these can cause immense damage 
to our interior and exterior bodies 
without us witnessing each step of 
a progressive destruction.
For me, anxiety is like an itch I 
can’t scratch — it’s there and I can 
feel it, but I struggle to find the 
exact spot and alleviate it. So when 

I see something that irks me, like 
a hangnail or a zit, I want it to go 
away as soon as possible and I go 
at it. I take something microscopic 
and make it a bigger deal than it 
is, just like I do with my anxious 
thoughts.
Despite all the years of intense, 
anxious habits, there is never a 
wrong time to try and cure them. 
I was 19 when I went to my first 
hypnotherapy session (when in 
reality I should have gone when 
I was younger), and it was there 
where I learned the importance 
of diving into my subconscious, 
finding out what it was exactly that 
I was anxious about and learning 
to control stressful thoughts. I, 

along with many, learned that my 
anxious thoughts and habits were 
subconsciously developed as a 
child, and my brain chose to carry 
that stress as I grew older.
It took a few sessions and 
my own meditative practices 
to really become present and to 
acknowledge the danger (and 
disgust) of this habit. When I put 
my fingers to my mouth, I am more 
aware that they are there and that 
what I was doing was actually 
painful. In a way, I bring more 
feeling and presence to this area of 
my body, which is hard considering 
I am so embarrassed by my fingers. 
 
It’s an active, mindful and 
incredibly 
difficult 
challenge 
to 
continuously 
tame 
your 
subconscious, but it’s surely not 
impossible. Even though I attended 
hypnotherapy (which is not the 
only option), I’m still attempting to 
cure my anxious habits. I’ve played 
with rubber bands to entertain 
my fingers or twist my rings as an 
alternative fidgeting activity. I take 
a deep breath and mentally take a 
step back. Meditation has taught 
me to be present in the moment, 
which can take away from those 
spiraling, anxious thoughts and 
put myself back into reality.
Acknowledging your anxious 
habit is the first step to ending 
them. 
Whether 
it’s 
through 
exercise, writing or meditation, 
I have found different methods 
of building self-awareness and 
mindful presence in order to 
maintain a calm head and physical 
space. My fingers are used for 
typing and climbing and guitar 
playing. My fingers can be used 
to craft and create and cook. The 
more we can transfer our anxious 
energies 
into 
positive, 
useful 
activities, the closer we are to 
winning our individual battles 
against anxiety.

On ‘Invasion of Privacy’ 
Cardi B is taking names

Cardi B has written a holy text 
for self-assurance, and its name is 
Invasion of Privacy.
The rapper started gaining 
attention in 2015 as an internet 
celebrity and cast member of “Love 
& Hip Hop: New York.” Since 
then, she has signed with Atlantic 
Records and released two complete 
mixtapes, Gangsta Bitch Music Vol. 
1 and Gangsta Bitch Music Vol. 2, 
in the span of less than a year. She 
was bold; she was brash; she was 
explicit and unapologetic about 
it. Then “Bodak Yellow” came out 
— her debut single — and when it 
captured the nation’s attention, 
it didn’t just show us exactly 
who Cardi B was going to be. It 
showed us who she already was: 
independent, brave and packing 
talent in every single word.
Invasion of Privacy does not 
disappoint. From the curtain-
drawing opener, “Get Up 10,” 
all the way through the final 
epilogue, “I Do,” Cardi B’s debut 
studio album is an explosion of 
bravado, irresistible beats and 
lyrical mastery. There isn’t a single 
track that does not demand the 
attention of the listener. Cardi sings 
about money and sex, she disses 
her enemies and references her 
relationship with Offset of Migos, 
and every step of the way, she has 
something to flaunt. Maybe this is 
part of why she has registered so 
much with the public as an agent 
of empowerment: She’s an expert, 

and listening to her music, you can’t 
help but want to be an expert, too.
The album makes use of its many 
featuring tracks, pairing Cardi with 
well-known artists like Migos, 
Chance The Rapper, Kehlani, 21 
Savage and SZA. In all of these 
cases, the artists’ talents are well 
matched. However, the real appeal 

of the album comes from Cardi 
herself, who fills in every track 
with the same insistent rhythms 
that made singles like “Bodak 
Yellow” and “Bartier Cardi” so 
popular. She repeats herself with 
new intonations, using hypnotic 
beats as her backdrops, making 
each line even more impactful than 
the one before it.
The lyrics are nothing to 
underestimate, 
either. 
Cardi 
slides from one line into the next 
with words so deftly chosen, it’s 
necessary to listen to each song 
more than once in order to fully 
appreciate the lexical complexity. 
“Only time that I’m a lady’s when 
I lay these hoes to rest,” from “I 
Do,” has to be the freshest pun of 
the entire year so far. And then 
there’s the title of the song, which 
sets up expectations that the song 
will have something to do with 
marriage, only to knock them down 
with the chorus: “I do / What I like, 
I do, I do.” From “I got enough 

bras, y’all ain’t gotta support me” 
in “Get Up 10” to Chance The 
Rapper’s line about “(turning) all 
my L’s into lessons” in “Best Life,” 
the wordplay that spans the entire 
album is artful and sharp.
As unafraid as Cardi B is of 
baring her confrontational side, 
she also doesn’t shy away from 
the more personal. In “Best Life,” 
she calls out her haters: “‘Cardi B 
is so problematic’ is the hashtag / 
I can’t believe they wanna see me 
lose that bad.” But “Be Careful” 
is probably her best example of 
vulnerability, a tender track in 
which Cardi warns her lover, “My 
heart is like a package with a fragile 
label on it, be careful with me.” 
With questions like, “Do you know 
what you doin’? / Whose feelings 
that you’re hurtin’ and bruisin’? 
/ You gon’ gain the whole world / 
But is it worth the girl that you’re 
losin’?” and promises that the song 
is “not a threat, it’s a warning,” “Be 
Careful” is where Cardi proves that 
she can draw just as much strength 
from vulnerability as she can from 
anywhere else.
Just like Cardi, Invasion of 
Privacy is impossible to shake out 
of one’s mind. She’s soft on “Be 
Careful,” imperious and explosive 
on “Bickenhead” and unstoppable 
all the way through. The album 
makes full use of her talents and 
her almost unrivaled personality 
and bravery. One could say that 
now that Cardi B is famous, her 
talent isn’t going anywhere, but in 
a sense, that would be wrong: It’s 
going straight up, with no sign of 
stopping.

Co-creators Bill Hader 
& Alec Berg talk ‘Barry’

A good actor feels everything 
and lives in the spotlight. A good 
hitman feels nothing and lives in 
the shadows. It’s impossible to be 
both. Or is it?
This is the question that HBO’s 
“Barry” sets out to answer. The 
30 minute black comedy follows 
a Midwestern hitman named 
Barry (Bill Hader, “Saturday 
Night Live”), who travels to Los 
Angeles to kill a man, stumbles 
into an acting class and decides 
to leave his life of crime behind to 
become an actor. Of course, this 
is easier said than done. Barry 
soon finds himself living a double 
life, killing by day and exploring 
the theatre scene by night. What 
results is a deeply affecting, 
sharply written and genuinely 
funny show that explores what 
it’s like when “the thing you’re 
good at is weirdly destroying 
you.”
The Daily had the opportunity 
to speak with Bill Hader and 
Alec Berg (“Silicon Valley”), the 
show’s co-creators, writers and, 
in Hader’s case, the star.
Hader 
and 
Berg 
began 
brainstorming the show back 
in early 2014 after their mutual 
agent 
suggested 
they 
work 
together. Though Hader and 
Berg didn’t know each other well 
at the time, they ran in the same 
comedy circles and both had 
individual deals with HBO.
“The winds were pushing 
us together,” remarked Berg. 
After a few months of writing 
and one discarded idea, Hader 
and Berg decided to focus on a 
phenomenon that had previously 
tormented Hader: “The idea of 
being very gifted at something 
you derive no pleasure from.”
This is referencing Hader’s 
time as a cast member on 
“Saturday Night Live,” during 
which he suffered from crippling 
performance 
anxiety. 
It’s 
a 
fascinating contradiction, being 
tortured by talent — one that Berg 

and Hader wanted to further 
explore. After isolating the heart 
of the show, Berg explained that, 
“we pretty quickly landed on a 
guy who’s really good at killing 
but hates it, and what he wants to 
do is act.”
It’s certainly a bizarre premise, 
but it works. It works very well.
This is a testament to the 
quality of both the writing and 
acting on “Barry.” (Hopefully) 
neither Berg nor Hader have 
experience as hitmen, so they 
conducted extensive research on 
the profession to accurately fill 
out the show. This is not Berg’s 
first time working on a research-
heavy project — learning the tech 
world of “Silicon Valley” required 
similar preparations.
In both shows, Berg noted 
a similar trend: “You know 
you’re on track for something 
interesting if the craziest stuff 
you imagine is not as interesting 
as the real stuff you find.” 
Interesting 
is 
not 
always 
pleasant. “Barry” required its 
writers to watch torture videos 
and learn what getting shot 
actually looks like. Berg and 
Hader also visited many Los 
Angeles acting classes, which 
can be either a wonderful or 
miserable experience, depending 
on who you ask.
Berg recalls how surprised 
he was when, “we saw a woman 
do an exercise where the acting 
teacher kind of humiliated her 
to the point where she broke 
down crying and, in the end, she 
thanked him for allowing her to 
access that.”
This scene is almost exactly 
replicated in the pilot when 
Barry stumbles into that fateful 
acting 
class 
while 
trailing 
Ryan 
Madison 
(Tyler 
Jacob 
Moore, “Shameless”), the man 
he’s supposed to kill. There, 
he witnesses acting coach and 
self-proclaimed 
genius 
Gene 
Cousineau 
(Henry 
Winkler, 
“Holes”) berate flighty actress 
Sally (Sarah Goldberg, “The Dark 
Knight Rises”) until she breaks 
down into tears.
“To the outside observer it 

looks like abuse but actors we 
talked to were like, ‘Oh, yeah, 
that’s an exercise,’” said Berg.
It 
is 
this 
subversion 
of 
expectations 
which 
makes 
“Barry” so special. The show 
doesn’t shy away from dark 
subject matter; rather, “Barry” 
embraces it. Beyond its hitman 
storylines, 
“Barry” 
offers 
glimpses into the less-glamorous 
side of working as an actor 
in Hollywood. As the season 
continues, the narrative takes 
breaks from Barry’s journey and 
follows other actors in his class. 
The ability to tell heavy, dark 
stories in short beats and still find 
comedy in those hard moments 
is one of the show’s greatest 
strengths. No matter where the 
characters are — an audition, 
a party, a Chechen mobster’s 
garage — there is humor, heart 
and heartbreak. As Hader put it, 
“It’s not like that movie ‘La La 
Land.’”
Though “Barry” is certainly 
not like “La La Land,” the 
production process sounded like 
something of a fantasy.
“It was this thing where you 
really look forward to going into 
work every day. It never felt like 
an obligation,” Hader recalled.
“There’s usually a thing on 
shows where there’s one a-hole, 
you know like, ‘Ugh, we have 
to work around the a-hole,’ and 
on this show — I guess it means 
that we’re the a-holes — no, there 
were no a-holes on the show,” 
Berg added. “Everyone’s there 
to do great work and there’s 
none of that ego nonsense. On a 
lot of shows, the actors are very 
concerned with who has more 
lines or who looks cooler or who 
has a better trailer. Everyone was 
here to make the show better and 
that’s when things really work 
… when everyone’s there for the 
right reasons.”
That everyone’s there for the 
right reasons is evident on screen. 
“Barry” is a weird, wonderful 
triumph, and a killer piece of 
television.
“Barry” currently airs Sundays 
at 10:30 p.m. on HBO.

According 
to 
Williams, 
Exogenesis will feature clothing 
from well-known designers and 
upcoming creatives alike. The 
looks, coupled with production 

design, will offer audience 
members an extra-terrestrial 
experience.
“Our 
theme 
‘Exogenesis’ 

surrounds 
the 
unknown,” 
wrote Williams. “The place 
where creativity and flyness 
come together and go hand 
in hand beautifully. Deriving 
from the Greek term exo- 
meaning ‘outside’ and genesis-
meaning ‘origin,’ these words 
come together to hypothesize 

that life might have originated 
elsewhere in the universe and 
then spread to Earth. With a 
ticket to our charity runway 
show and our models as our 
muses, we are set to launch 
the audience towards fashion 
elsewhere in the universe.”
The runway show begins at 
7:00 p.m., while doors open to 
VIPs at 6:00 p.m. and to the 
general public at 6:30 p.m.. 
Tickets range from $17 (General 
Admission) 
to 
$35

Jack Brandon: To begin, 
how were you all introduced to 
Anderson’s films?
Danny Hensel: I saw a 
trailer for “Moonrise Kingdom” 
before I was interested in film. 
When I finally watched it, it 
was so different than anything 
I had seen. The dialogue and 
character interactions were 
surreal, and I immediately 
became 
interested 
in 
Anderson’s films and film in 
general. When I realized that 
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” 
was about to come out, I got 
into his catalogue and watched 
them all. 
Stephen Satarino: For me, 
“Fantastic Mr. Fox” existed 
when I was child, before I 
knew what a director was, but 
I was super into it. “Moonrise 
Kingdom” really got me when I 
was older.
Max 
Michalsky: 
I 
remember I went with my mom 
and younger brother to the 
theater, and the first movie we 
wanted to see was sold out, but 
we instead went to see “The 
Grand Budapest Hotel,” and I 
was taken aback by it. It was so 
unique in almost every regard. 
I didn’t care that much about 
movies at that time, so watching 
Wes Anderson was so overtly 

different but still accessible. 
It was what prompted me to 
consider movies an art form. 
I found “Grand Budapest” to 
be a moving film. I don’t think 
Wes Anderson gets enough 
credit for that, I think people 
pigeonhole his films into being 

heady or cold. There’s always 
this human thread running 
through them. I think about 
the traditional Wes Anderson 
dialogue, speaking matter-of-
factly and deadpan.
Sydney Cohen: I remember 
being struck, for the first time 
with “Grand Budapest,” at such 
an overtly stylized film where 
every element and miniscule 
detail is perfectly placed, and 
this gorgeous symmetry I had 

never seen before in a feature 
length film, and I was just 
awestruck by it. Anderson has 
such a distinct brand that it’s 
very impressive, and “Grand 
Budapest” imprinted on me 
the ideas of directors having a 
specific style. 
Jack: So what I’m getting is 
that Anderson’s films are very 
stylized and artistic, but not 
necessarily inaccessible. Why 
do you think that is?
Stephen: 
Thematically, 
he deals a lot with finding 
the family or people coming 
together. 
I 
think 
that’s 
necessarily accessible.
Danny: All of his movies 
borrow from concepts and 
tropes that we’re very familiar 
with. For example, “Fantastic 
Mr. Fox” is a heist movie, and 
with George Clooney as the 
voice actor, who has played 
heist 
characters 
before, 
he makes the film easy to 
read. When we combine that 
familiarity with the genre 
and the actor, and put it in 
a context where it’s quote-
unquote artistic, or maybe 
deadpan, we can still buy into 
the emotional weight that the 
film holds because we’re able 
to recognize their settings 
and 
contexts 
from 
other 
viewings. There’s a line in 
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” 
that breaks me every time: “In 
the end, they shot him.” They

don’t show the death, and it’s 
delivered very simply with no 
affectation. It still obliterates 
me 
because 
knowing 
the 
context, the historical setting, 
the characters and connecting 
with them from the world he 
has established and the one the 
audience lives in.
Max: I think there’s a 
relatability, 
too, 
especially 
in the presentation. If you 
look at “Moonrise Kingdom,” 
“The Grand Budapest Hotel,” 
or “The Royal Tenenbaums,” 
they are all presented as if the 
audience is being told a story. 
There are often narrators or 
third parties observing the 
events of his stories. Anderson 
almost builds in company for 
the viewer, and I think that’s 
a really big thing that makes it 
easy to feel. It almost goes back 
to being a kid and being told a 
story by your parents.
Danny: 
Interestingly, 
I 
think theatre and plays factor 
into a lot of his works, like in 
“Rushmore,” where the main 
character Max is a playwright, 
in “The Royal Tenenbaums,” 
where 
Gwyneth 
Paltrow’s 
character is an award winning 
playwright from a young age 
and in “Moonrise Kingdom,” 
when Sam and Suzy meet for 
the first time.
Stephen: The book motif 
is present too. I heard Wes 
Anderson wanted to write 
novels when he was in college, 
and that shows itself. 
Sydney: The essence of 
childhood and playfulness is 
also an attractive thematic 
thread 
present 
in 
all 
his 
movies. There’s a juxtaposition 
between the deadpan delivery 
and the themes at play.
Jack: Going back to the idea 
of style and form, Anderson’s 
work is very much about 
control, in the way that he 
dictates the symmetry and 
curates the color of each film. 
Do you find it restricting in 
any way?
Sydney: It interacts with 
theatre, in how you would 
construct a scene on a stage. 
I feel that way when I watch 
Wes 
Anderson 
movies, 
in 
that each scene is an overt 
performance, like all the set 
pieces are specifically placed 
in a stage.
Danny: He has so many 
fully visualized worlds, and 
I feel controlled by him, but 
he is responsibly showing me 
everything he wants me to see. 
It’s like going to a really high 
quality restaurant and having 
a chef who knows exactly 

what you want to eat out of a 
five course meal and presents 
it to you in exactly the order 
you want to have it. There’s 
other food, sure, but you don’t 
want it in that moment. You 
just want to eat what the chef 
gives you. It’s a little limiting, 
because there is such a tight 
control he places on actors, the 
performance and the camera 
movement, but when it’s so 
delightful to watch it, I don’t 
really mind losing that control.
Jack: When is he at his best, 
then?
Becky: 
“The 
Royal 
Tenenbaums.” I think what 
Danny 
was 
saying 
about 
world-building makes a lot 
of sense, like in “Fantastic 
Mr. Fox,” you have all these 
heist themes, and I think in 
“The Royal Tenenbaums,” all 
the characters have so much 
substance and they’re so well 
developed that you feel for 

every single one. It’s silly and 
quirky, but it still has emotion 
to it. I think in some of his films, 
the aesthetics are distracting, 
like 
“The 
Grand 
Budapest 
Hotel” was a little too much 
Wes Anderson for me. We get 
it, there’s a pink hotel and 
there’s a bellboy, and there’s 
whimsy and nostalgia, and 
all these other things you’ve 
never seen before but you feel 
like you have. But I think “The 
Royal Tenenbaums” does a 
good job of making it more 
than the aesthetics and giving 
the characters more.
Max: Talking about “The 
Royal 
Tenenbaums,” 
I’ve 
been thinking about the scene 
where he tries to kill himself, 
and Elliott Smith is playing, 
and asking where does that fit 
in Anderson’s modus operandi?
Stephen: I think a lot of 
people don’t give him enough 
credit 
for 
doing 
daring 
things with his characters. 
People get distracted by his 
aesthetic, and oftentimes the 
stories themselves are pretty 
compelling. I love that scene 
because as far as color palettes, 
a lot of the film is oranges and 
yellows and greens, and that’s 
just a blue scene, except for the 
red of the blood.
Danny: It reminds me of the 
pirate attack scene in “The Life 
Aquatic.” When I first saw it, 
(it) was super jarring, but the 
more and more I watch it, I 
appreciate it. Right before Bill 
Murray becomes an action star, 
all the crewmates are praying 
to themselves, up against the 
wall, at gunpoint. On first 
viewing, it’s a little strange, 
but the more I watch it, it’s so 
harrowing. It’s this moment of 
emotional realism in a movie 
that is formerly anything but. 
It’s visually a very strong 
blue, but after that scene, the 
color palette becomes a lot 
more natural. I tie those two 
together because Anderson is 
known for having emotionally 
distant characters, but there 
are those really important 
moments of emotional realism 
that I always feel like pays off.
Stephen: There’s also the 
end of “Moonrise Kingdom,” 
when they’re on the top of 
the church, and it’s black and 
white with a blue filter thrown 
over it.
Danny: It’s a really strong 
blue, it’s like experimental 
film blue.
Jack: Back to this idea of 
form, “Isle of Dogs” is stop-
motion, and it’s not Anderson’s 
first venture into the form. 
It’s an interesting medium for 
someone who is as exact and 
precise as he is.
Sydney: For “Fantastic Mr. 
Fox,” I love an adult movie in 
a kid’s format. I think it’s so 

impressive and fascinating and 
consuming when you watch 
these little characters perform 
a heist. I think “Isle of Dogs” 
will do the same, especially 
with the cultural specificity 
of Japan, and I’m interested to 
see how it does it.
Danny: It’s interesting to 
see it as a method of control, 
because he starts using it 
in “The Life Aquatic,” and 
then again (in) “The Grand 
Budapest 
Hotel” 
in 
small 
amounts. Obviously in a movie 
about aquatic life, when the 
animals are hard to control and 
he creates so many of them, it’s 
useful that he uses it to create 
this world. I can’t imagine 
CGI in an Anderson film. Stop 
motion fits the niche of not 
quite real, but if you don’t look 
closely, it will seem real.
Sydney: The tactility of 
the figures matches up with 
Anderson’s aesthetic. 
Becky: I think there’s this 
analogue thing about it, too. 
Anderson loves being back in 
time, the super nostalgic and 
the retro. The first animations 
were stop motion. 
Sydney: 
Animation 
is 
such an interesting medium. 
I saw “Kubo and the Two 
Strings” a couple of years ago. 
It looked like origami, but it 
was animation, and I think 
Anderson 
does 
something 
similar with the physicality of 
his figures. He takes pieces of 
his film and makes them part 
of the animation, which is 
impressive.
Danny: I think for practical 
considerations as well, there’s 
no way that “Fantastic Mr. 
Fox” would have been live 
action, and the same goes for 
“Isle of Dogs.” I could not 
see that existing. I feel that 
any other form of animation 
wouldn’t fit his style.
Jack: But I feel that the 
narratives in those films are 
fables, and these characters 
are very human, and you could 
just as easily take them back 
from the animal world that 
Anderson put them in.
Max: 
That’s 
one 
thing 
I’m interested to see in “Isle 
of Dogs.” We talked about 
Anderson’s interest in the old 
fashioned, but “Isle of Dogs” is 
set in some dystopian future, 
and I’m curious about what he 
does with that. I think that’s 
something we haven’t seen 
from him.
Jack: Similar to that, a lot 
of Wes Anderson’s films deal 
with childhood on the small 
scale, but “Isle of Dogs” looks 
at it from a wider lens, in terms 
of state control and other 
people.
Sydney: I’m excited to see 
him tackle larger things, like 
institutions and government 
bodies, but he’ll likely stay in 
his wheelhouse and talk about 
childhood and relationships. 
Based on the trailer, with 
the boy and his dog, which is 
a very sentimental pairing, 
it will probably be close to 
home. However, the cast list 
is enormous and full of talent. 
Anderson has a big pull on 
people he works with. I’m 
obsessed with the voice talent.
Jack: As a final question, 
what 
are 
Anderson’s 
contributions to film?
Becky: I think he’s a great 
example of textbook auteur 
theory, like you watch the 
opening credits of the film, you 
know it’s a Wes Anderson film. 
He has such a definitive touch 
to his films that harkens back 
to another time of filmmaking 
and directing. If we could see 
inside Wes Anderson’s brain, it 
would be pastel and pretty.
Stephen: I don’t know if 
he’s pioneering a genre or 
anything, but I do think he will 
be one of the most influential 
filmmakers.
Jack: Do you think Anderson 
is innovative?
Max: I do, but not in the 
way we might expect. When 
we 
think 
innovation, 
we 
talk about something new in 
technique, but he has created 
new things with very old 
tropes and aesthetics. With 
everything needing to have 
a reboot nowadays, I think 
that Anderson brings things 
from the past without being 
derivative. He has existed 
entirely outside of that, and 
resists the need for film to be 
sleek or current, and I think 
that choice is innovative. In the 
next 15 or 20 years, it will be 
interesting to see the films of 
the children he has influenced.

All of his movies 
borrow from 
concepts and 
tropes that we’re 
very familiar 
with 

He has such a

Wolverines improve thanks to return of seniors Finn and Morrissey

Expectations are high in a 

program when coaches compare 
players to all-time great athletes 
like Michael Jordan or LeBron 
James. But those expectations 
were justified when applied to 
fifth-year runners Erin Finn 
and Jamie Morrissey.

“Both of them here and at 

the end, Morrissey, the team’s 
happy that (Finn and Morrissey 
are) 
back,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach James Henry. “Because 
they’re our LeBron James of 
the program. They’re our Kobe 
Bryant of our program. They’re 
our Michael Jordan of track and 
field. 

“I mean, they’re some of the 

best of the best. And when the 
best of the best go down, your 
program, you’re not as good. 
So we’re significantly better by 
having those two, those young 
ladies in the program.”

As game-changing runners 

for the Michigan women’s track 

and field team, the long-awaited 
return of Finn and Morrissey 
could only offer improvement 
— and their impact on the team 
showed at the Battle of the Blues. 
The Wolverines finished second 
in a field of three and, more 
notably, with 25 career bests.

After a three-year absence 

in outdoor track, Finn saw her 
first event since 2015 after 
redshirting her junior year and 
sitting out all of senior year 
due to injury. Normally when a 
player returns from injury, rust 
or decline might make its rounds 
in the first few performances. 

But for Finn, she immediately 

saw the success she and her 
team anticipated. The “little one 
with a big heart” — as Henry 
called her — showed just how 
big her heart was. Through hard 
work and perseverance, she ran 
a career-best time of 9:14.31 in 
the 3,000-meter event in her 
return.

With advice from associate 

head coach Mike McGuire to 
pace herself, Finn concentrated 
on her timing. She ran a 

74-second pace for the first 
two laps before finishing the 
final lap on a 71-second pace 
that allowed her a personal best 
— and third-best in Michigan 
history for the 3,000-meter 
outdoor race.

Henry, 
despite 
grouping 

Finn with some of the greatest 
of all time, was just taken 
aback. Caught off guard by her 
dominant showing, he had in 
every way anticipated that rust 
that plagued many who return 
from injury. 

“She approached the race 

showing 
she 
was 
healthy,” 

Henry said. “She wasn’t going 
after a career best because you 
can’t be an injured-reserve and 
hurt and out and expect to just 
come in right away and do your 
best. But she’s paced herself and 
that’s what we want.”

Morrissey, similarly, had total 

control of her race in her return 
to outdoor action.

Doing her part in the team’s 

mid-distance and long-distance 
sweep, Morrissey posted a time 
of 2:05.11 for the 800 meters — 

.02 seconds from her personal-
best. She and Finn led the way 
for the distance runners to make 
their mark in the event, as they 
— along with seniors Claire 
Borchers and Haley Meier — 
claimed first in their respective 
events.

But 
Michigan’s 

accomplishments to the distance 
events didn’t come as a surprise 
to Henry.

“That’s 
the 
part 
of 
our 

program,” Henry said. “That 
goes the same way with all of 
our kids. We build our program 
around 
long 
distance 
and 

middle distance. They are our 
bread and butter. As they go, so 
does the team. And we just do 
our very best in those areas, but 
we build our program around 
distances. So it’s expected and 
they expect to weigh in terms of 
performances.”

What 
also 
didn’t 
come 

as a surprise to him was 
the 
improvement 
showed 

throughout the roster, and not 
just by the Wolverines’ distance 
runners.

25 career bests were posted 

throughout the meet, which was 
the main focus for the team. It 
was never about winning. It was 
about growth.

“That’s what we want,” Henry 

said. “This was our first scoring 
meet before the conference 
meet. It gave us a chance to 
compete 
against 
different 

competition. It gave us a chance 
to get many of the kids involved 
in scoring in the meet. 

“Our goal was not to win the 

championship or this particular 
meet — the Battle of the Blues. 
Our goal was to improve. So 
to have 25 kids come out and 
do such an improvement, we 
might not have won but we were 
successful.”

Meier, in addition to her twin 

Hannah, helped highlight the 
depth Michigan displayed with 
their 
improvements. 
Going 

first and second respectively 
in the 1,500-meter, the Meier 
twins paved the way for a group 
of seven Wolverines to finish 
within the top ten.

Despite 
the 
second-place 

finish, Michigan came out of 
the meet with the best outcome 
it could have expected. As Finn 
and Morrissey improved toward 
their best forms, the rest of the 
team followed suit and provided 
their best efforts in turn. With 
the pace of growth likely to 
continue, the comparison to 
great athletes might not be 
limited to just Morrissey and 
Finn, but to the rest of the team 
as well.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Senior Erin Finn returned to the Michigan outdoor track and field team for the first time in three years and set a personal record in the 3,000-meter race.

Marody, Calderone sign entry-level contracts

Just 
three 
days 
after 
the 

Michigan hockey team lost, 4-3, 
to Notre Dame in the Frozen Four 
semifinals, junior forward Cooper 
Marody and senior forward Tony 
Calderone signed NHL entry-level 
contracts.

After breakout seasons, Marody 

inked a deal for three years with the 
Edmonton Oilers and Calderone for 
an undisclosed duration with the 
Dallas Stars on Sunday.

Marody and Calderone led the 

offensive attack as two-thirds of 
the lethal “DMC” line alongside 
senior 
forward 
Dexter 
Dancs. 

Together, the trio accounted for 53 
of Michigan’s 136 goals, 34 percent 
of all points and a plus-minus rating 
of plus-48.

Originally 
selected 
by 
the 

Philadelphia Flyers in the sixth 
round and 158th overall in the 2015 

NHL Entry Draft, Marody’s rights 
were traded to the Oilers on Mar. 21 
for a 2019 third-round pick.

“I am so grateful that I had the 

opportunity to play for two of the 
best coaches in college hockey, 
Red Berenson and Mel Pearson,” 
Marody 
said 
in 
a 
statement. 

“Combined with their exceptional 
assistant coaches and support staff, 
they have prepared me for the next 
level. The teammates I have had the 
honor of playing alongside the past 
three seasons have made it the best 
time of my life.

“The Children of Yost, the 

Michigan Hockey Band, alumni 
and fans make playing at Yost 
an 
unforgettable 
experience. 

My lifelong dream of playing at 
Michigan and wearing the block ‘M’ 
was even better in reality.”

In his first full season as a 

Wolverine, the Brighton, Mich. 
native led the team in scoring with 
51 points on 16 goals and 35 assists 

to rank third in the country and 
first in the Big Ten. Marody became 
just the third Michigan player to 
lead the conference in scoring and 
was named to the All-Big Ten first 
team. On Friday, he was selected as 
a CCM/AHCA West Second Team 
All-American.

Down 
the 
stretch, 
Marody 

registered four goals and five assists 
in six postseason games. His two 
tallies, including the game-winner, 
led the Wolverines to a 3-2 win 
over Northeastern in the NCAA 
Regionals and the 25th Frozen Four 
berth in program history.

Calderone led the conference 

with 25 goals to go with 19 assists 
for 44 points, all career highs for 
the captain. He scored seven times 
on the power play and posted four 
game-winners during his senior 
campaign.

An All-Big Ten second team 

honoree, the Trenton, Mich. native 
tallied six goals and three assists in 

the playoffs. His four goals in the 
Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals 
against Wisconsin tied for most 
in a game in Michigan history. In 
134 career games as a Wolverine, 
Calderone notched 54 goals and 37 
assists.

Last April, Pearson spoke with 

Calderone about his potential to 
play professionally after college. 
Always a sharpshooter from the slot, 
Pearson encouraged him to improve 
his skating, speed and overall 
conditioning to compete at the next 
level. Calderone put in the time to 
become more well-rounded, and it 
paid dividends Sunday afternoon.

“Extremely happy to announce I 

have signed my first NHL contract 
with the @dallasstars,” Calderone 
said in an Instagram post. “I want to 
thank @umichhockey for the best 4 
years of my life. I also want to thank 
my family and friends who have 
supported me and helped make this 
dream come true.”

Bock finishes fourth in 
all-around at Big Tens 

After Dmitri Belanovski closed 

out his second rings routine of the 
weekend with a stuck dismount, 
he pointed to the cameras.

The senior — competing for 

a Big Ten title on the still rings 
Saturday night during his final 
competition in Ann Arbor — 
knew he’d executed his routine 
well enough to earn a good score. 
He scored 13.800, good for fifth 
place in the final.

“I stuck to what I’ve been 

doing all year,” Belanovski said. 
“I definitely have the lowest 
start value out of these ten guys 
competing, but I stuck with my 
execution, stuck my dismount 
and just did what I did overall all 
year long.”

Placing 
just 
ahead 
of 

Belanovski 
was 
freshman 

Cameron Bock, who earned a 
fourth-place finish with a score 
of 13.825.

“Cameron has really, really 

come around on that event, has 
really developed a lot this year,” 
said Michigan coach Kurt Golder. 
“Strategy for (Belanovski), was, 
you know, he had a little elbow 
issue, we watered it down a little, 
went clean and conservative, and 
it worked out well for him.”

Bock 
started 
his 
strong 

weekend Friday with a fourth-
place finish in the all-around 
with a score of 82.800.

On the floor, Bock hit a clean 

routine with the only deductions 
coming in hops on the landing of 
his tumbling passes. He followed 
up his floor routine with good 
form and rhythm on pommel 
horse, earning a score of 13.750 
— his third-highest tally of the 
season. Four more clean routines 
earned him the highest finish 
of a freshman in the all-around 
competition.

“I just put on on every event,” 

Bock said. “I hit 6-for-6 and 

just came out with a really good 
score.”

In 
Saturday’s 
high 
bar 

competition, Bock executed three 
challenging releases and took 
just a small step on his dismount 
to score 13.725, just 0.25 below 
his qualifying score and good for 
another fourth-place result.

“He has, I think, a really smart 

routine,” Golder said. “One that 
fits his abilities well, and yeah, 
just real clean.”

On the vault, juniors Emyre 

Cole and Anthony McCallum 
placed 
fourth 
and 
fifth, 

respectively. It was McCallum’s 
third vault of the season, and 
the performance should serve 
him 
well 
with 
the 
NCAA 

Championships looming.

“I think particularly today, 

it’ll help him,” Golder said. “You 
know, he came up a little short 
and he was just pulling to make 
it yesterday, and we were very 
happy about that. But I think he’ll 
probably get a big confidence 
boot by his vault today.”

Though 
each 
gymnast 

performed a perfectly fine routine 
in Saturday’s competition, the 
results did not follow how they 
were expected to perform after 
earning second place in the team 
competition on Friday. None 
of the individual competitors 
improved upon their qualifying 
scores, leading to middle-of-the-
pack finishes.

The NCAA Championships 

are just two weeks away, and 
the Wolverines are hoping to 
capitalize on the momentum 
from the team competition and 
perform better than last year’s 
ninth-place finish.

“We haven’t been in the 

top six, we haven’t been in the 
NCAA finals the last two years,” 
Belanovski said. “We proved a 
lot of people wrong with this top 
two finish yesterday. We’re just 
looking to get back in the top six 
and fight for that NCAA trophy.”

Michigan falters in final round, finishes ninth

The 
Michigan 
men’s 
golf 

team placed ninth at the Aggie 
Invitational, in part due to an 
uncharacteristic 
weekend 
of 

Texas weather.

“The weather, really all day 

(Saturday), it was up there for 
one of the two or three worst 
weather days I’ve ever had in 
fourteen years of coaching,” 
said Michigan head coach Chris 
Whitten. “It was so cold and 
rainy and windy.”

Up against seven top-10 teams 

in a field of 14, the Wolverines 
shot 36-over (900), 31 shots 
behind the champion, No. 1 
Oklahoma State.

Leading the way for Michigan 

was senior Kyle Mueller, who 
placed 
fifth 
individually 
at 

3-under par for the weekend. 
However, he and his team 
had an off round to begin the 

tournament.

“It’s a hard golf course to begin 

with, and we brought all the layers 
that we could,” Whitten said. The 
guys were absolutely prepared, 
but they were still absolutely 
freezing. And when you can’t feel 
your hands in golf, 
it gets tough.”

Despite 
the 

unfavorable 
conditions 
and 

suspended 
play 

due to darkness, 
the 
Wolverines 

rebounded, 
posting 
the 

second-highest 
team score in the 
second 
round 

early Sunday morning. The effort 
was led by Mueller as well as 
senior Ian Kim, who shot 1-under 
and even-par, respectively.

“That was just the guys’ 

complete, sheer determination,” 
Whitten said. “(The course) was 
still playing almost as tough in 

the afternoon as it was in the 
morning, and they just got in a 
groove and went to work.

“Kyle (Mueller) is just like 

a rock every single week. He’s 
always going to be in contention, 
which is fantastic for our team. 

And Ian (Kim) 
gave us a really 
good 
second 

round. And the 
guys felt good.”

Through the 

front 
nine 
of 

the final round, 
Michigan 
remained 
in 

contention, 
ahead of three 
top-25 
teams. 

The wheels came off on the back 
nine, though, which caused the 
Wolverines to settle for ninth in 
the tournament.

“I think we made a couple too 

many mistakes on the final nine 
holes of the final round, and I 
wish we would have finished a 

little bit higher,” Whitten said. 
“But the guys fought pretty hard 
the whole time.

“We just couldn’t hit enough 

good shots, and a couple guys 
missed some shorts putts, too. 
We had done well. It’s just that 
good play needs to continue all 
54 holes and until the very end 
of the tournament. You can’t just 
play two good rounds or two-
and-a-half good rounds.”

One underlying story that 

affected Michigan’s lineup this 
past weekend was that junior 
starter Nick Carlson missed the 
first tournament in his career due 
to a shoulder injury. Recognizing 
that it will take time for the 
injury to heal, Whitten continues 
to look forward with the players 
he currently has.

“The second round of the 

tournament was very good, and 
I think we can look at what we 
did there from top to bottom,” 
Whitten said. “And that’s what we 
need every round, every week.”

Kim leads Wolverines 
at Greensboro tourney

Spurred by freshman Ashley 

Kim, the Michigan women’s 
golf team came out strong at 
the Bryan National Collegiate 
in Greensboro, N.C. At the end 
of Friday’s opening round, the 
Wolverines sat in first with a 
team total of 291 — their best 
of the spring season.

But the team wasn’t aware 

that it led the field. The 
tournament had a shotgun 
start with 36 continuous holes 
on Friday. There was never a 
moment to cherish the lead.

Michigan couldn’t keep up 

the record pace. The team 
carded a 309 later on Friday to 
move into 10th. And Saturday, 
the Wolverines 
battled 
harsh 

weather 
and 

shot 
a 
310 

to 
finish 
in 

eighth. 
Wake 

Forest topped 
the 
17-team 

field with an 
888 
three-

day 
total 
— 

22 
strokes 

better 
than 

Michigan.

Due to her solid play early 

on Friday, Kim sat tied for 
fourth with an even-par 72 
heading into the afternoon. 
There, she carded a 74 to drop 
into a tie for ninth. Senior 
Emily White also excelled 
for the Wolverines during the 
first two rounds, reaching 
24th place with a two-day 
total of 149.

Michigan 
coach 
Jan 

Dowling was pleased with 
her team’s stellar play — 
especially 
putting 
— 
that 

helped it lead early on.

“Just phenomenal golf for 

our program and a much-
needed confidence booster for 
our team as well,” Dowling 
said about the opening round. 
“To be totally honest, we 

haven’t played our best golf in 
a couple tournaments. It was 
nice for the team to see what 
we are capable of.

“The team started to see 

some putts fall, which was a 
really nice thing.”

Rough playing conditions 

made Saturday difficult. The 
fairways were drenched from 
pouring rain, and heavy winds 
worsened the situation.

With the tough conditions, 

Kim and White slipped up. 
They both tallied scores of 78 
on Saturday and finished the 
tournament in 12th and 29th, 
respectively. The team as a 
whole, though, did damage 
control and gave up only one 
double bogey on the day.

The 
tournament 
marked 

Kim’s 
third 
consecutive 

time 
leading 

the 
team. 

The 
southern 

California 
native is used 
to 
playing 

in 
pleasant 

conditions. 
Since the start 
of her freshman 
year, 
she’s 

worked 
with 

the 
coaching 

staff 
on 
controlling 
her 

trajectory, and this helped her 
score well over the weekend. 
Dowling closely followed her 
performance.

“What was really fun for 

us to see was her play so well 
in difficult conditions. It was 
kind of a new experience for 
her,” Dowling said. “A top-
12 finish in that field, as a 
freshman on that golf course, 
is really impressive.”

Sophomore Alisa Snyder, 

junior Elodie Van Dievoet 
and 
sophomore 
Hannah 

Ghelfi also competed for the 
Wolverines and finished 40th, 
47th and 63rd, respectively.

“There are certainly a lot 

of positives to take away,” 
Dowling said. “It was a great 
field and a hard golf course.”

WOMEN’S GOLF

Pitching has become backbone

M

uch like the team as a 
whole, the Michigan 

baseball pitch-
ing staff strug-
gled through 
the first 15 
games of the 
season, post-
ing an earned-
run average of 
4.66. 

Since then, 

the Wolverines 
have recovered 
in dramatic fashion, both from a 
team and pitching perspective. That 
ERA has decreased to 2.20 — the 
byproduct of younger pitchers 
stepping up and bettering the 
performances of returning starters 
from last year. 

Coming into the season, senior 

right-handers Alec Rennard and 
Jayce Vancena were expected to 
anchor the rotation. Alongside 

veteran outfielder Myles Lewis and 
shortstop Ako Thomas, Rennard 
and Vancena were the only players 
seated for preseason Media Day. 

Following three outings earlier 

in the season, over which he had 
posted a 3.38 ERA, Rennard was 
shut down while recovering from 
a prior injury. For a struggling 
pitching staff, the loss of their 
supposed ace was an unwelcome 
blow. 

Vancena, on the other hand, has 

struggled mightily thus far and has 
been demoted from a starting role 
to being used intermittently as a 
reliever.

The unexpected turn of events 

provided the perfect opportunity 
for the young guys to step up. And 
they have certainly done so. 

If you need an example, look no 

further than the staff’s weekend 
performance against Big Ten foe, 
Northwestern. 

In game one of Saturday’s 

doubleheader, sophomore left-
hander Tommy Henry posted 
a career-high nine strikeouts in 
six shutout innings of work. His 
dominant performance paved the 
way for junior reliever Troy Miller 
to finish the shutout with four 
strikeouts of his own. 

The second game saw freshman 

Ben Dragani claim his third win of 
the season in similar fashion. The 
understated left-hander, who has 
posted a stellar 1.13 ERA thus far 
this season, allowing only one hit 
in seven innings. Fellow freshman 
Jeff Criswell kept the Wildcats off 
the scoreboard, too before junior 
left-hander Will Tribucher struck 
out two of the final three batters to 
close it out. 

“Ben’s very talented,” said 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich. “He 
was the Gatorade Pitcher of the 
Year in Wisconsin as a high school 
senior. So he came in very skilled 
to begin with. It’s one thing to have 

multiple pitches that you can throw 
for strikes, but what makes him 
very good is the competitiveness 
with which he pitches and the poise 
he has on the mound as well.”

Thanks to the Wolverines’ 

pitching staff, Northwestern 
suffered two shutouts in one 
afternoon. 

The youthful contingent 

of Henry, Dragani, Criswell, 
Tribucher and sophomore right-
hander Karl Kauffman have 
become the backbone of the team. 
More specifically, a streaking team 
which has won its last 15 games and 
currently sits atop the Big Ten.

“It’s all contagious,” Bakich 

said. “Everybody’s feeding off of 
each other. The bullpen guys go 
in and see what the previous guy 
did before him that had success 
and follows that blueprint. The 
confidence among the whole 
pitching staff is obviously extremely 
high right now.”

Allan finds her groove 
in sweep of Penn State

Lou Allan was waiting for the 

changeup.

It was the same pitch from Penn 

State pitcher Madison Shaffer that 
had fooled the freshman earlier in 
Saturday’s game. In fact, it had 
fooled Michigan’s entire lineup. 
But in the seventh inning, with 
senior right-hander Tera Blanco 
on second and the score tied 0-0, 
Allan knew she wouldn’t be fooled 
again.

When the pitch came, she was 

ready.

Joining the Wolverines as the 

No. 8 prospect in the country 
according to FloSoftball, Allan 
was expected to make an impact 
right away. But things never turn 
out quite as expected, and for 
Allan, her fate was particularly 
crushing: a knee injury just before 
the start of the season.

“I was super down the first 

couple — the first week,” Allan 
said. “ … I had this stupid injury, 
and 
(Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins) just came in there every 
day (while) I was doing rehab 
during practice and say, ‘You’ve 
gotta come back stronger.’ ”

Hutchins’ 
words 
of 

encouragement changed Allan’s 
mentality. Instead of viewing her 
injury as a crushing blow, she saw it 
as something that would make her 
stronger. She recovered faster than 
the doctors expected and seized 
the starting designated player job 
shortly before conference play. 
Still, recovery from injury is a 
process, and it took time for Allan 
to hit her stride.

“I was kinda behind on games 

compared to the rest of the team,” 
Allan said. “So for me, it was just 
seeing more pitches and getting 
back into the swing of things.”

Against 
Penn 
State, 
her 

resilience paid off.

On Friday, Allan hit the ball 

over the fence in the top of the 

fifth for her first career home run. 
It extended the Wolverines’ lead 
to 6-0 in an eventual 14-2 win.

“Every week, she gets a little 

better,” Hutchins said. “ … She 
makes adjustments better than 
probably any kid I’ve ever seen. 
She can make an adjustment in 
one pitch.”

Which brings us back to the 

changeup.

Sure, the game was scoreless, 

but 
the 
scoreboard 
can 
be 

deceiving. 
Michigan 
left 
11 

runners on base through the first 
six innings. The Nittany Lions, on 
the other hand, had just five total 
baserunners. At the heart of the 
Wolverines’ woes was that pitch. 
Just when it seemed Michigan 
was about to break through, 
Shaffer would go to her changeup 
again. It would drop off the table 
as the batter swung right over.

“We were swinging at decent 

pitches,” Allan said. “But then she 
would throw her changeup and all 
of a sudden, we were swinging out 
of our shoes.”

Allan stepped up to the plate 

in the seventh knowing that 
she couldn’t let that pitch defeat 
her again. She would come back 
stronger.

She took two balls and waited 

for the pitch she knew was 
coming. She swung. And, when 
the Wolverines needed her most, 
she delivered.

“All I needed to do is hit it to the 

outfield,” Allan said. “Make it hit 
the green.”

It did more than that. The 

ball sailed over the fence for a 
home run to get Michigan on the 
board, 2-0. The Wolverines would 
eventually win the game, 3-0, 
and took Sunday’s contest, 11-1, to 
secure the sweep.

Whether 
faced 
with 
a 

significant injury or a baffling 
changeup, some players would 
have succumbed to frustration. 
But for Allan, it was just another 
challenge to tackle head-on.
