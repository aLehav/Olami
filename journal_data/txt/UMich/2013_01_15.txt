Daily StaffReporter
University Police have released
screenshots and a video from
security cameras in West Quad
Residence Hall of a person they
are trying to identify in connec-
tionwith the Jan.13 rape case.
On Sunday, a student reported
that between 12:45 a.m. and 1:30
a.m. she was raped
after coming back
from a party with
the suspect. Univer-
sity police released
a crime alert to the
campus commu-
nity at around 9 a.m.
Sunday.
The video shows

University Police also updated
their suspect description Monday
evening with further informa-

police are classifying the incident
as first-degree Criminal Sexual
Conduct. She said it was unclear
whether there were witnesses to
the incident.
Brown said police are current-

Bernanke made clear the

the Fed has implemented two

FACULTY ASSEMBLY
rrSACUA talks Rackham
policy changes and tuition

New tuition
fellowships and
registration
unveiled
ByASHWINI NATARAJAN-
Daily StaffReporter
At the Senate Advisory
Committee on University
Affairs' weekly meeting on
Monday, members deliberated
Rackham student policy changes
and the University's tuition
affordability.
Janet Weiss, Rackham dean
and vice provost for academic

affairs, and Michael Benson,
president of Rackham Student
Government, informed SACUA
members of the new changes
that were made to the Rackham
Student Registration Policy.
Updates included increased
financial and University
resources for students, such
as health services and sports
facilities.
The University created,
hundreds of tuition fellowships
tolessen the financial burden on
students. Startinginthe fall 2012
semester, students were given
financial aid with tuition and
GradCare coverage, a University
medical insurance program.
The changes to registration

policy pertain to a graduate
student's enrollment status.
With the new policy, if a student
doesn't register for either the
fall or winter term, he or she is
presumed to have withdrawn
from the University.
Weiss said before the policy,
students did not have to
register to be an active student.
As a result, their status as a
Rackham student was uncertain.
Following the change, the
standing of students is easier to
distinguish, she said.
"Now we actually know how
many Ph.D. students we have,"
Weiss said.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Toyota regains top
spot in vehicle sales
Toyota has once again
dethroned General Motors as the
world's top-selling automaker.
The Japanese company sold
9.7 million cars and trucks
worldwide in 2012, although it's
still counting. GM sold 9.29 mil-
lion.
. Both companies saw higher
sales, but Toyota's growth was
far larger as it rolled out new ver-
sions of popular models like the
Camry. GM executives promised
sales growth this year, especially
in the U.S. Both companies say
publicly that they don't care
about who wins, but concede
that the crown is an important
morale booster for employees.
GM was the top-selling car-
maker for more than seven
decades before losing the title to
Toyota in 2008. But GM retook
. the sales crown in 2011 when
Toyota's factories were slowed
by an earthquake and tsunami in
Japan. The disaster left Toyota
dealers with few cars to sell. The
company has since recovered.
PHOENIX, ARIZ.
Governor opts for
* federal Medicaid
enlargement
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said
Monday she plans to push for an
expansion of the state's Medicaid
program under the federal health
care law, a surprising decision that
could have an impact on other
Republican governors weighing a
similar decision.
Brewer has opposed the fed-
eral health care law known as the
Affordable. Care Act, citing wor-
ries over a potential overreliance
on federal funding.
A provision in the 2010 law
allows for states to increase Med-
icaid coverage, and Brewer told
lawmakers in her annual State
of the State address on Monday
that virtually all of the expan-
sion would be funded by the fed-
eral government. Not taking the
money wouldn't contribute to the
lowering of federal deficits, she
said.
CONCORD, N. H.
$700 million case
against two oil
companies begins
Day one of what is expected
to be a marathon pollution trial
over the gasoline additive MTBE
ended Monday with lawyers for
the state of New Hampshire and
two big oil companies heatedly
accusing each other of mislead-
ing jurors.
The judge denied demands for
a mistrial made by Citgo's law-
yer, Nathan Elmer, but may give
jurors a special instruction when
the trial resumes Tuesday with

more opening statements from
the lawyers .
The state is seeking more than
$700 million from Citgo and
ExxonMobil to cover the cost of
monitoring and treating MTBE-
contaminated wells. Lawyers-for
the state argue that the MTBE
gasoline is a defective product
and that oil companies failed to
warn the state of its potential for
widespread groundwater con-
tamination.
KHARTOUM, SUDAN
Chinese workers
kidnapped in

China's Foreign Ministry says

fur region by unidentified gun-
men.
Monday's statement says the
men are employees of the China
Railway 18th Bureau Group who
were building a road in North
Darfur just outside the regional
capital of El-Fasher.
Sudan's state news agency
SUNA has blamed the abduction
on a Darfur rebel movement, but
it stopped short of naming which
group.

'Invisible scalpel' could
replace radiation treatment

Tool aims to more
efficiently destroy
cancerous tumors
By IANT DILLINGHAM
DailyStaffReporter
University researchers have
demonstrated the effective-
ness of a new technology that
has the potential to dramati-
cally improve surgical proce-
dures. .
Termed an "invisible scal-
pel," the laser-generated
focused ultrasound seeks to
improve the quality of non-
invasive surgical procedures
by turning high-energy lasers
into ultrasound waves. The
waves are then concentrated
onto a single focal point where
they can potentially destroy
cancerous cells or tissue.
Engineering Prof. Jay Guo,
one of the study's authors,
said the innovation is similar
to current cancer treatments
using radiation with a signifi-
cantly higher level of precision
and potential for other appli-
cations.
. "You can use it to kill cells,"
Guo said. "You can (also) use
the ultrasound to change to
permittivity of the cell mem-
branes, so you can deliver
drugs through the cells' mem-
branes and treat the tissues
and cells."
Some types of cancerous

tumors are currently treated
using radiation therapy. Guo
said this method often destroys
the targeted area but can also
cause damage to the surround-
ing tissue.
Compared with radiation,
however, Guo said the LGFU
has the ability to target very
specific areas, like a very small
tumor, and to alleviate the col-
lateral damage to healthy tissue.
"We've shown in our experi-
ment that (the LGFU) can focus
down to the size of a human
hair," Guo said. "In one experi-
ment ... we showed that you can
detach the cells one by one, so it
really localized with great pre-
cision."
The technology behind the
LGFU is currently used in sev-
eral forms of photo-acoustic
imaging, a method which com-
bines optics technology with
ultrasound. These images use
similar technologies to the
LGFU, but are taken at much
lower energies, thus causing
minimal damage to the tissue.
Hyoung Won Baac, a
research fellow at Harvard
who worked as a doctoral stu-
dent in Guo's lab, said the new
technology also demonstrates
a much greater level of accu-
racy than traditional methods.
"There isalready a focused
ultrasound technology nowa-
days routinely used in hospitals
for therapeutic applications
with several-millimeter accu-
racy," Baac said. "But a main

drawback of the classical equip-
ment has been improved greatly
by our work with a focal accu-
racy of smaller than 0.1 milli-
meters."
Starting in 2010, the
researchers at Guo's lab began
using carbon nanotubes to
improve the performance. The
tubes were then embedded in a
polymer material that provides
a better thermal expansion.
Even with these improve-
ments, the device was still only
capable of imaginggiven its low
intensity.
"We need more improve-
ment and verifications for
more practical level of demon-
stration," Baac said. "But if it
works, the ultrasound surgery
may work in a non-invasive,
non-thermal and elaborate
way. This will target tumors
or problematic tissues exactly,
keeping.. healthy nerves and
blood vessels intact."
As the researchers continue
to improve the device, they
hope to collaborate with the
University of Michigan's Medi-
cal School and other depart-
ments to help develop the
technology for use on human
subjects in the future.
"(The LGFU)- .has great
potentials for high-accuracy
therapy," Baac said. "For prac-
tical use, we will collaborate
with biomedical engineers and
doctors to determine next tar-
gets and directions in clinical
purposes."

Students can enroll
in more than 130
themed courses
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
Three years ago, Amy Har-
ris, director of the Museum of
Natural History, was askedby an
Ann Arbor public school teacher
to bring the travelling exhibit,
"Race: Are We So Different?" to
her museum.
Harris brought the exhibit to
the University-,an action that
in part inspired the Winter 2013
LSA Theme Semester, "Under-
standing Race."
The theme semester aims to
engage students in a dicussion
about race, through numerous
events and activities that are
targeted at both the University
community and public school
districts in Washtenaw County.
The University plans to host 90
events, 15 exhibits and is offer-
ing 130 different courses related
to the theme.
Teachers in Washtenaw
County school districts will lead
discussions about race in their
classrooms before and after vis-
iting the exhibit at the museum,
and the University will host a
series of monthly conversations.
Harris said she hoped that
University students would
attend and engage in some of
the student-orientated events,
such as a Martin Luther King
Jr. Day speech by Morris Dees,
chief trial counsel for the South-
ern Poverty Law Center, and a
multimedia presentation, "We
Can End Racism," led by artist
Damali Ayo in April.
Among the 130 courses, LSA
is offering several new courses
specifically created for theme
semester. One such course, The
Aryan Race: Myth, Truth and
Fiction, seeks to examine both
how conceptions of race are
formed and how they influence
our self-perception.
History Prof. Masuzawa, who
teaches the course with Associ-
ate Prof. Gayle Rubin, wrote in
an e-mail interview that the
course grew out of a graduate
seminar the pair taught with
retired History Prof. Thomas
Trautmann in 2005 and a desire
to reach a broader spectrum of
students.
Masuzawa wrote that the.
course aims to foster a conver-
sation on various ways in which
we approach discussing race.
She added that looking to the
past to explore the history of
the Aryan race functions as a
good starting point for the con-
versation.

"We would like students to
find such a moment to pause,
to think, and to converse, at a
little distance from the usual
tugs and disputes (about race),"
Masuzawa wrote. "Instead, (we
would like them to learn) in the
company of books, histories and
unfamiliar facts."
Another course, Community
Collaborations: Race, Social
Justice and Engaged Learning,
taught by Associate Prof. Megan
Sweeney, looks into the relation-
ship between. universities and
outside communities.
"It seemed so important to
recognize that faculty members
have engaged in community-
oriented research related to the
African American community
engagement ... as part of the race
theme semester," Megan Swee-
ney said.
Sweeney said she wants her
students to gain an understand-
ing of the history of community
involvement and develop hands-
on projects that help students
explore their own identity in
relationship to others.
"There is a great deal of
importance in thinking about
race and structural inequalities
as you work with students who
are involved in (communities),"
Sweeney said.
Efforts to foster a conversa-
tion about race are what drew
LSA senior Sara Blanks to coor-
dinate events for the theme
semester.
Growing up biracial, Blanks
said many people don't think
about racism as much as she
does. But she hopes the theme
semester can change that.
"I want people to actually
have conversations about it,"
Blanks said.
Harris, the museum director,
said race has always remained
an important national conver-
sation and is particularly true
in light of the coming inaugu-
ration and 150th anniversary
of the Emancipation Proclama-
tion.
"It is always a good time to
talk about race," Harris said.
"There is a constant stream of
things that happen locally and
nationally that illustrate that it
is important to be thinking and
talking about race."
Harris added that by holding
this semester-long conversa-
tion, the University has made
it a priority to foster a diverse
campus which is welcoming for
everyone.
"This is another opportunity
for the campus to really focus
on this issue and talk about it,"
she said. "Racism is embedded
in our institutions, and in order
to make changes, we need to
understand that."

Program allows students to
become sustainability scholars

11-credit track
focused on
leaders and the
environment
By CHELSEA HOEDL
Daily StaffReporter
The maize and blue faith-
ful have a chance to go green
through a special interdisci-
plinary sustainability program
offered to a group of qualified
University students.
The Undergraduo*e Sus-
tainability Scholars Program
is an 11-credit, interdisciplin-
ary study dealing with sus-
tainability and leadership
development. It was created
and funded by the Graham
Environmental Sustainability
Institute.
Andrew Horning, the direc-
tor of the Graham Environ-
mental Sustainability Institute,
said sophomores can apply to
the program online this month.
Interested students are asked
to submit an essay, resume,
transcript and two recommen-
dation letters by January 25.
Each year, about 30 students
are selected to participate in
the program. Horning said
those selected are representa-
tive of "all corners of the cam-
pus."

"It's a competitive program
open to students throughout
the university in any school
or college, but they have to go
through a rigorous, competi-
tive process to apply," Horning
said.
Engineering junior Diana
Bach, who was selected for the
program last year, said she has
always been interested in sus-
tainability initiatives and was
enticed to apply.
"This was just a really
good way for me to get more
involved on campus and be
able to connect with a lot of
other students who are also
interested in sustainability,"
Bach said.
Selected scholars complete
two seminars, a "Sustainabil-
ity and the Campus" course,
pre-approved elective courses
and a field-based course. The
Graham Institute grants each
scholar up to $3,000 to com-
plete his or her field study.
The field-based course
allows students to look at the
"big picture," according to
LSA senior Marie Tysman,
who completed her field study
requirement in Iceland last
May.
"We looked at the sustain-
ability, how people lived and
the geothermal energy that
they have there," Tysman said.
"There are a lot of geother-

mal plants and hydrothermal
plants that we visited. We also
did a lot of hiking to see the
natural habitat and what they
are doing to try and conserve
it."
While there are pre-
approved field study programs,
scholars may create proposals
to complete their requirement
elsewhere. Students have trav-
eled all over the world, with
some staying within the Unit-
ed States and others going as
far as Brazil, Kenya, Germany
and China.
Tysman - a former writer
for The Michigan Daily - said
the program allowed her to
connect her experiences and
interests with her courses in
sustainability.
"It's a real-life experience
where you're learning about
how the environment interacts
with what you're interested in,
whether that be politics, the
food industry, whatever you're
studying," Tysman said.
Tysman added that the pro-
gram is not only capable of
changing how you make small
decisions, but also decisions
that are life changing.
"It's really shaped how I
view the world," she said. "It's
changed how I view every-
thing, how I want to live my
life after college and even how
I travel and what I purchase."

If October's sleeveless porch drinking wasn't enough of an indi-

was Hurricane Sandy, which racked the Mid-Atlantic in late October.
Despite these events and evidence supporting a significant climate
change, environmental issues have drifted out of mainstream media
and were dismissed in the 2012 election cycle. This issue cannot be
pushed to the backburner. In a country where extreme weather con-

to fulfill his earlier promises by prioritizing policies that combat the
impacts of climate change.

ASAD PASOON I VIEWPOINT
What's next for Afghanistan

Duringthese first carefree
weeks of school, take
some time to explore the
non-academic
surroundings
that make up our
campus. You can
witness a politi-
cal rally or run
into a friend on
the Diag. You
can take a walk, ANDREW
play Frisbee or ECKHOUS
just enjoy nature
in the Arb -
although everyone knows what
really goes on there, hippie. You can
even watch a pun-loving man play
his harmonica and scratch his Dust
Bowl-era washboard outside of the
Shapiro Undergraduate Library.
Those are just some of the many
examples of how the public spaces
around us make our lives a little
more colorful. I may spend an inor-
dinate amount of my time trapped in
the dizzying dichotomy of thinking
and drinking, but what will I remi-
nisce about in the future? Decades
from now, when I'm telling my kids
stories, from my college years, I'm
sure I'll mention the Diag, Arb and
many of the other public spaces that
distinguish our beloved university
rather than the grimy nights I spent
at Rick's American Cafe.
Unfortunately, Ann Arbor's
dejected sibling to the east, Detroit,
doesn't have much in the way of
public spaces. Hart Plaza is a little
run-down, the adjoining RiverWalk
isn't nearly what it could be and
Belle Isle is broken. Campus Marti-
us, however, stands out as a beacon
of what Detroit's future could hold.
4 Locatedin theheartofdowntown
Detroit, Campus Martius park was
renovated and rededicated in 2004
with help from corporate sponsors
and has been essential in the bur-
geoning revitalization of Detroit.
It's a walkable public space that
wouldn't seem out of place in a real
live, functional city - a merit badge
Detroit has yet to earn. Growth has

flourished directly because of Cam-
pus Martius, as workers want to
spend time outside of their offices
now. Restaurants, retail shops, con-;
venience stores and hotels all have
opened their doors over the past
decade or so, giving Detroit cheer-
leaders like me hope that change
and development are possible.
If the Detroit problem is to be
solved, safe and usable public spaces
will play a vital role in solvingit. Dan
Gilbert, chairman of Detroit-based
Quicken Loans and advocate for
the rebirth of the city, can provide
10,000 workers jobs downtown, but
if none of the employees live in the
city, many of Detroit's workers will
remain commuters. The city needs
to be an inviting place if the popu-
lation is to grow. New green spaces,
playgrounds and- even renovated
sidewalkswould all help Detroit cul-
tivate an image of a people and fam-
ily-friendly city, and would speed up
the rebuilding process.
In the 2010 census, there was a
25-percent drop in population, buta
59-percent increase in people under
35 with a college education, illus-
trating that there's a budding class
of young professionals in Detroit.
That growth, however, must be sup-
ported. Attracting more of these
young professionals into the city
can be achieved through creat-
ing the types of public spaces that
are common in city neighborhoods
nationwide. Even something as sim-
ple as a dog park is an excellent way
to encourage interaction among
city residents, but only one exists in
Detroit, and it's in disrepair. How-
ever, a few Detroit residents, see-
ing the need, successfully launched
a campaign that generated more
than $15,000 for apark, and the city
granted the permits.
The Detroit Dog Park is an encour-
aging example of what the future of
Detroit could hold. If public space
expands, the social culture of the city
will expand with it. The same people
that walk their dogs or ride their
bikes during the day will frequent

bars, concert halls and restaurants at
night. Who knows, maybe it wouldn't
be so ridiculous for future Univer-
sity students to drive to Detroit for a
night of drinking and dancing, oth-
erwise known as "supporting Michi-
gan's economy."
Public space can provide positive
opportunities for communities as
well. In December, Ford pledged $10
million to create a community cen-
ter in southwest Detroit's Mexican-
town neighborhood, one of Detroit's
most vibrant communities. This
center will offer adult education,
job training and a food bank. Most
importantly, it will foster communi-
ty growth and give Detroit youth the
chance to succeed that they might
not have had otherwise. Ultimately,
these successful youths might give
back to the city that raised them,
and Detroit could undergo a make-
over from its very own people.
If public space
expands, social
culture will follow.
When people think of New York
City, they think of Central Park.
When people think of Chicago, they
think of Grant and Millennium
Park. When people think of Detroit,
they think of ... wait, what exactly?
If the city and state invest in mak-
ing Detroit a viable city socially -
not just economically - people will
begin to think of Detroit in terms of
its energetic social scene and thriv-
ing economy instead of its empty
and factories. The future of Detroit
is no longer a fantasy, but a goal to
work toward. With support from
University students, we could make
Detroit an exciting extension of our
University experience.

Nofoodfor thought

Last Friday, President Barack Obama and
Afghan President Hamid Karzai met to dis-
cuss troop withdrawal and the possibility of
leaving behind residual forces in Afghani-
stan beyond 2014, but the future of Afghani-
stan remains unsteady: The country is facing
the imminent thread of Taliban's resurgence.
Despite a decade of American intervention,
Mullah Omar, Taliban's spiritual leader, is
still alive and leading from his hideouts in
Pakistan. Both presidents have officially rec-
ognized Taliban's office in Qatar, predicting
their possible return to power.
From a perspective of an Afghan who was
persecuted under Taliban era, this news isn't
very encouraging. This also holds true from
the perspective of an American. Is it fair to
let go the lives of more than 2,000 U.S. ser-
vicemen and women who died in the war?
Moreover, the million-dollar question now is
whether Taliban would bow down to the dem-
ocratic constitution of Afghanistan backed
by the United States or follow their version
of Sharia law. Despite that, frustration on the
part of the American public led to a push for
withdrawal as early as spring 2013, ahead of
the scheduled summer 2013.
But as American troops depart Afghani-
stan, they leave behind a widely corrupt gov-
ernment, which is an exemplary model of
nepotism and cronyism. The current Karzai
administration has benefited the most out of
the U.S. presence. With the taxpayer's money,
most of the Afghan officials have bought vil-
las in Dubai and transferred large amounts of
cash to their bank accounts outside of Afghan-
istan. Karzai and his staff do not have much
at stake whether the United States stays or
leaves. By April 2014, Afghanistan will hold
its presidential election. Karzai's term will
expire, and, as he promised, he will step down.
He and most of his leading cabinet members
will most likely seek refuge in a Western coun-

try even long before the last U.S. service mem-
ber leaves Afghanistan.
The face of post-Karzai leadership is
uncertain. Chances are slim that a Western-
educated Afghan technocrat would be able to
accomplish a majority's vote. The dominant
group composed of the former Northern Alli-
ance will most likely have an upper hand in
the election. Apart from the widespread cor-
ruption they will inherit, the Northern Alli-
ance, a longtime Taliban rival, would further
ignite the ethnic tensions. Northern Alliance
is predominantly Tajik, while Taliban are
largely Pashtuns, provoking the Taliban's
commitment to weaken the Kabul Govern-
ment. Chances are also very small that both
rivals will be able to work together in an
effective fashion ifa coalition government is
to be formed.
With such a background, the only hope
for Afghans is to feel some kind of assurance
from the United States - that is, to have U.S.
presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014. Fortu-
nately, Obama's administration is weighing its
options and is currently in negotiation with
the Afghan government regarding the immu-
nity of U.S. forces so they are not subject to
Afghan laws. It's very likely that the Afghan
government would grant such approval. A
presence of U.S. forces would keep an eye on a
different faction within the country, in hopes
of de-escalating violence. Such a presence
would also force the Taliban to put aside their
dream of taking over Kabul.
However, the U.S. government must put
more pressure on Afghan officials both pre-
and post-2014 to curb corruption within the
government and to publicly prosecute high-
level corrupt officials. Without a transparent
and public-service-oriented institution, the
outlook for Afghanistan will still be bleak.

From purchasing buses that
run on biodiesel tousing
electrically powered main-
tenance vehicles,
the University
has made a con-
certed effort
to reduce the
environmen-
tal impact of
its on-campus
transportation.
If the University ZOE
truly wishes to STAHL
be sustainable,
however, it must
focus on how its 80,000 students,
faculty and staff move around Ann
Arbor. The University should begin
working towards this goal by run-
ning buses to off-campus grocery
stores. This service would not only
reduce the University's steadily
increasing carbon footprint, but
also help alleviate the issue of food
security on campus.
Though we often focus on how
many miles the food has traveled
from the farm's fields to the grocery
store's aisles, the number of miles
driven by food shoppers is just as
important. Studies conducted by
the U.K. Department of Environ-
ment, Food and Rural Affairs found
that 82 percent of food miles - the
distance -food travels from pro-
duction to consumer - were not
generated globally, but from travel
within Great Britain. Of those food
miles, 48 percent came from con-
sumer shopping trips, while the
trucking of food accounted for 31
percent of food miles. Switching
to buses would be a relatively easy
way to minimize the environmen-
tal impact of food shopping, which
is often overlooked despite these
statistics signaling that the issue
should be addressed.

BERNANKE
From Page 1
down.
He has also attempted to
reduce long-term interest
rates through large-scale asset
purchases, such as mortgage-
backed securities. Such activity
has had positive effects on
spending and investment and
has also helped reduce mortgage
interest rates.
Collins asked Bernanke'
to address the critics of his
unconventional monetary
policies, who say that lowering
interestrates takes pressure off of
Congress and that massive asset
purchases can incur serious risk.
Bernanke said the Federal
Reserve has a dual mandate
from Congress: to achieve price
stability - or low inflation -
and maximum employment.
While the policies have
maintained inflation at a low rate,
unemployment rates are still too
high.
"Our effort to try and create
more strength in the economy
and put people to work ...
motivates and justifies what has
been an aggressive monetary
policy," he said.
Though high unemployment
is still an issue, Bernanke
believes things are going in the
right direction and would like
to continue with his approach of
communicating to the public and

large-scale securities purchases.
Bernanke cautioned that
his institution has authority
over monetary policy, but it is
Congress that is responsible for
fiscal policy.
"I think that it's not really up
to the Fed to be playing games
to try to induce Congress to
do what it needs to be doing,"
Bernanke said. "Congress needs
to take care of their job, which is
to address fiscal issues."
While most of the discussion
focused on federal fiscal and
monetary policy, Bernanke did
devote some time to talk about
the economic conditions in the
state of Michigan.
He explained that because
Michigan is so reliant on the
automotive industry, when sales
dropped during the recession,
unemployment in' the region
exceeded the national average.
While the region is taking
positive strides toward
recovery, he cited much room
for improvement. Like other
industrial regions, Michigan is
doing a good job diversifying into
the technology, health care and
education industries, Bernanke
said.
Bernanke said he places high
value in studying economic
history and that mistakes made
during the Great Depression
heavily influenced his approach
during the 2008 fiscal-crisis.
Kathryn Dominguez, a
professor of public policy

and economics who has done
much research on the Great
Depression, said in an interview
after the discussion that she
supported Bernanke's monetary
approach.
"He did exactly whatstudents
of the Great Depression would
have done," Dominguez said.
"The Fed was not aggressive
enough during the depression;
they were contractionary
when they needed to be
expansionary."
Though the discussion
touched on many topics,
Bernanke said his priority was
to see the economy continue
to recover and to see the labor
markets become stronger. For
many of the students in the
audience, Bernanke's discussion
did inspire some confidence in
the future.
LSA sophomore Evan
Carpenter said Bernanke eased
some of his concerns about the
nation's economy.
"I think it was reassuring just
to hear that he was 'cautiously
optimistic' about the future,"
Carpenter said. "I don't think
anyone is optimistic about
the future because there is so
much uncertainty, but to hear
him say if all goes according to
plan, everything will work out is
reassuring."

"The way chips were made
at this time were very much by
hand," Nakamura said. "Part of
the reason that the Indians were
understood to be ideal for this
work is that Indian women were
famous for their rug making and
jewelry production. The thinking
was that this was the same kind of
thing."
Nakamura's research showed
that the Shiprock plant had
the lowest error rate for new
semiconductors among all the
Fairchild plants. While the
Fairchild plant in San Rafael had a
40-percent error rate, the Navajo
women recorded just 5-percent
error.
But Nakamura's research
also revealed the factory's
negative impact on the Shiprock
reservation.
"One of the complaints that
workers at Fairchild had was that

also elucidated; if a student is
discontinued or has voluntarily
withdrawn for aterm, the student
can re-apply to their respective
programs to reenroll.
During the first two years that
this policy was implemented, 16
out of the 23 students who applied
for re-enrollment were accepted
by the faculty of their programs,
Weiss said.
There was some controversy
over the reinstatement-fee policy,
which previously stated that half
of an enrollment fee would be
paid by the program and half
would be paid by the student.
This policy also made the fee
25 percent of the prevailing
candidacy tuition at the term of
re-instatement for each fall and
winter term that the student
was gone from the program.
SACUA members questioned
the rationale for increasing the
fee in proportion to the time the
student was not enrolled.
Weiss said the fee maxed out
at eight semesters and provided
an -incentive for an expedited
return to Rackham and would
benefit students.
"(We wanted) to encourage
students to return as quickly

they didn't have time to do any
rug weaving or even take care of
their own children," Nakamura
said. "Rugs were made out of a
form of cultural expression, but
no one makes a circuit out of a
form of cultural expression."
In 1975, the American Indian
Movement occupied and
destroyed the plant because of
protests over Native American
unionization and the lack of
employment for men in the
community. Even after the plant
closed, however, the legacy of
Native American culture in
digital media remained strong in
the United States, Nakamura said.
"Indians were the original
D.I.Y.-ers," Nakamura said.
"They were an inspiration to
the counter-culture: buckskins,
fringes, moccasins,beads,braids."
The presentation also included
an open discussion between
Nakamura and audience
members. Many in attendance
were members of the University's
Science, Technology and Society
Program.
as possible ... for establishing
relationships with their advisers,
for ease of presumption of
financial support, to minimize
the amount of catch up the
students needed to do in their
research field," Weiss said. "As
long as students keep enrolling,
and as long as the faculty
continues to say that students
are making progress towards the
completion of their degree, we
have no interests in preventing
anyone from earning a degree."
Weiss further emphasized
the yield of this new policy:

Her goal completion rate is

SACUA DISCUSSES
TUITION AFFORDABILITY
SACUA members also
discussed the issue of tuition
affordability at the University.
Members suggested that the
University is unaffordable for
students and the general public,
and that measures have to be
taken to combat the trend.
SACUA Vice Chair Kimberlee
Kearfott said she is concerned
tuition limits the University's
applicant base. Other members
stressed that the University's
priorities in conveying its tuition
aid need to be more clear and
transparent.
Physics Prof. Finn Larsen
specifically.wanted to improve
the quality of information that
the University provides to the
public about its financial aid
policies.
' "If they look on= the actual
financial aid webpage, they are
incredibly obscure, and they're
opaque, they are misleading, and
I think it's on purpose."

a desire to learn and grow.
"We didn't say, 'OK, we only
want the best and the brightest,"'
Phillips said. "I wanted to open it
up to students who said, 'Hey, I
want to become a doctor, and I'm
a B student. But with this on my
resume, it has encou-aged and
pushed me to excel."'
The program is made up of
about 20 high-school students,
mainly freshmen, but also a
few seniors who have a strong
interest in pursuing a pre-med
degree in college.
Finks said another goal of
the program is to help students
understand "the kind of
academic achievement you need
to have, that commitment to
studying, that sacrifice you have
to make," in order to become a
doctor.
The students will be exposed
to a variety of introductions
to the field of . medicine. On
Jan. 9, students came to Ann
Arbor to take part in a series
of simulations similar to those
that Medical School students
participate in. Students have
also attended a panel discussion
led by University doctors and
medical students, took a tour of
University facilities and went
through mock exam rooms.
Finks said future activities
will include a career day and

activities centered on anatomy
and global health.
Although the program
currently has activities
scheduled only through the end
of the year, Finks hopes to work
with students throughout their
remaining years of high school.
He said future years may involve.
undergraduate students from
the University serving as guides
as the high-schoolers approach
college. He also said he hopes to
repeat this program for incoming
freshman.
Students are working in small.
groups on their own capstone
projects which involve research
on a health crisis of their choice
in order to understand how they
can help reduce occurrences
of that condition in their
community.
In addition to the hands-on
experiences, Cass Tech students
have each been' paired with a
Medical School mentor. Finks
said their role is to be accessible
to the students, share their
experiences and answer any
questions they may have.
Medical School student
Brittani Jacksonsaid she thinks
mentoring is one of the most
important parts of this process.
"Even if our conversations
aren't medically related, just
to have a presence, and to see
someone who is where you would
like to go is very important,"
Jackson said.
Jackson is proud the

University is aiding students
from Detroit.
"It says so much that the
University of Michigan is making
this a priority," Jackson said.
"The fact that they are investing
in the future - I'm so excited to
be a part of that."
Cass Tech freshmen Nicole
White and Jordan Gregory are
participating in the Doctors
of Tomorrow program. White
said she aspires to be a cosmetic
surgeon and Gregory, a
veterinary surgeon.
"They give us the knowledge,
and we actually get to do the
things and practice," White said.
"It's a good head start."
"They're not just introducing
us to one type of doctor. They're
introducing us to the entire
(medical) world," Gregory said.
White and Gregory both
said they are learning about the
college atmosphere in general,
not just the field of medicine.
"It's not just playing around
with the tools and learning
procedures," Gregory said.
Phillips said she feels very
lucky that her students have this
opportunity and hopes they will
continue to be empowered by
their experiences.
"The thought of having high-
profile physicians and med
students to take from their day
to spend hours with our students
giving back to the community
speaks volumes to me and to the
students."

Mubarak's new trial could
answer key question

Ex-President'George H.W.
Bush leaves the hospital

Oldest living
former Chief of
State treated for
bronchitis
HOUSTON (AP) - Former
President George H.W. Bush was
released from a Houston hospital
and went home Monday after
spending nearly two months
being treated for a bronchitis-
related cough and other health
issues, a family spokesman said.
Bush, 88, the nation's oldest
living former president, was
admitted to Methodist Hospital
on Nov. 23. His stay included
a week in intensive care last
month.
"I am deeply grateful for the
wonderful doctors and nurses
at Methodist who took such
good care of me," Bush said in a
statement released by spokesman
Jim McGrath. "Let me add just
how touched we were by the
many get-well messages we
received from our friends and
fellow Americans. Your prayers
' and good wishes helped more
than you know, and as I head
home my only concern is that I
will not be able to thank each of

you foryour kind words."
Bush had been in the hospital
for about a month before his
office disclosed in late December
that he was in intensive care
because physicians were having
difficulty controlling a fever
that developed after the cough
improved.
His office said on Dec. 29
that he had been moved back to
a regular hospital room. Since
then, his conditionhad continued
to improve and he has been
undergoing physical therapy to
rebuild his strength.
"Mr. Bush has improved
to the point that he will not
need any special medication
when he goes home, but he will
continue physical therapy," Amy
'Mynderse, the doctor in charge
of Bush's care, said in Monday's
statement.
Bush's office said he was treated
for a bacterial infection, along
with the bronchitis and cough.
Bush. and his wife, Barbara,
live in Houston during the
winter and spend their summers
in Kennebunkport, Maine. On
Jan. 6, they celebrated their 68th
wedding anniversary. They are
the longest-married presidential
couple.
"The problem now is he's no

longer going to be pampered
by all these nurses and health
care providers in the hospital;
now his caregiver is Barbara
Bush," Bush's son, Jeb, the
former governor of Florida, joked
Monday at an education forum in
Nashville, Tenn.
"Now I'm going to have to call
my mother and apologize," he
quickly added.
White House press secretary
Jay Carney posted a message on
Twitter stating: "Great news re
POTUS 41," areferencetoBushas
the nation's 41st president. "From
44 down, we all are relieved he's
out of the hospital and wish him
& his family well."
Bush had served two terms as
Ronald Reagan's vice president
when he was elected in 1988 to
be the nation's 41st president.
Four years later, after a term
highlighted by the success of the
1991Gulf War in Kuwait, he lost to
Democrat Bill Clinton amid voter
concerns about the economy.
Bush has a long record of
service, beginning with his
enlistment in the Navy in World
War II. At one point, he was the
nation's youngest naval aviator.
He was shot down in the Pacific
and rescued by an American
submarine.

Responsibility for
brutal crackdown
maybe assigned
CAIRO (AP) - Hosni
Mubarak's new trial may resolve
key questions unanswered in
his first one: Who ordered the
crackdown that left some 900
protesters dead and who pulled
the trigger?
But the answers could
complicate the new president's
efforts to stabilize Egypt and
deal with its economic woes since
they might bring pressure to go
after still powerful figures in the
security forces.
'Mubarak and former Interior
Minister Habib el-Adly . were
sentenced to life in prison in June
for failing to prevent the killings
during the 18-day revolution in
2011 that toppled the leader's
29-year regime. Standing trial
with them were six police
generals, five who faced the same
charges, while the sixth was
accused of gross negligence. All
six were acquitted.
The ruling raised widespread
public anger over what was seen
as a shoddy prosecution case.
Many believed Mubarak should
have been convicted for directly
ordering the lethal crackdown.
The presiding judge of that first

trial said the prosecution's case
lacked concrete evidence and
failed to prove the protesterswere
killed by the police, indirectly
giving credence to the testimony
of top Mubarak-era officials that
"foreigners" were behind the
slayings between Jan. 25 and Feb.
1, 2011.
Nearly 100 police officers have
been brought to trial ina string of
cases over the nearly two years
since Mubarak's Feb. 11, 2011,
ouster. All were acquitted or
received suspended sentences on
charges of killing and wounding
protesters, a trend that has
angeredthosebehindtheuprising
who say authoritarian rule
cannot truly be ended without
dismantling what is left of the
Mubarak regime, particularly
in the large police force and
pervasive security agencies.
On Sunday, Egypt's main
appeals court overturned the life
sentences against Mubarak and
el-Adly and ordered a new trial
for the two. It also granted the
prosecution's request to overturn
the acquittals of Mubarak, his
two sons and an associate of the
former president, Hussein Salem,
on corruption charges. Salem was
tried in absentia and remains at
large. Six police generals who
were found not guilty also will be
tried again.
No date has been set for the

newtrial and no word on whether
they would be all be tried together
or separately.
Mubarak's supporters cheered
the decision, which came in
response to an appeal by the
former leader's lawyers.
But the outcome of the new
trial could bring a new setback for
the 84-year-old ousted leader.
If convicted again, the life
sentence passed against Mubarak
and el-Adlywouldbeupheld.They
could also have their sentence
reduced or even be acquitted.
This time, the case could
be boosted by new evidence
contained in a confidential report
by afact-findingmissionappointed
by Mubarak's successor, Islamist
President Mohammed Morsi.
Ahmed Ragheb, a prominent
rights lawyers and a member of
the fact-finding mission, said the
report has established the use
of deadly firearms by the police
against the protesters.
That finding, if substantiated
in the proceedings, would bring
responsibility for the crackdown
closer-to Mubarak and el-Adly.
The report has also found
that Mubarak, contrary to what
his defense lawyers have said
all along, was fully aware of the
extent of the uprising and how
security forces dealt with it
though a live television feed into
his palace.

New York poised to be the first
to pass post-Newtown gun bill

Legislature close
to a vote on revised
state gun laws
ALBANY, N.Y. - New York
lawmakers were poised to vote
Monday night to enact tougher
anti-violence legislation in what
would be the nation's first gun
control measure following last
month's Connecticut school
shooting.
"I think when all is said and
done, we are going to pass a
comprehensive gun bill today,"
Sen. Jeffrey Klein told report-
ers. "I'm very excited about it. I
am very confident we are going
to vote on a comprehensive bill
that will be agreed on by the
governor, the Senate and Assem-
bly."
People familiar with closed-
door negotiations told The Asso-
ciated Press a tentative deal was
struck over the weekend fol-
lowing the push made by Gov.
Andrew Cuomo last week in his

State of the State speech. The
people spoke on condition of
anonymity because the proposal
had not been discussed among
rank and file legislators.
The package hits on several
fronts including a much tighter
assault weapon ban and restric-
tions on .ammunition and the
sale and storage of guns, accord-
ing to final provisions obtained
by The Associated Press. The
package would also create a
mandatory police registry of
assault weapons under a more
restrictive definition.
All private 'sales would be
subject to a background check
done through a licensed dealer
and the bill would require the
reporting of mentally ill people
who say they intend to use a gun
illegally, according to the provi-
sions confirmed by five legisla-
tive officials.
The package is part of Gov.
Andrew Cuomo's gun control
bill and priorities of Democrat-
ic and Republican legislators in
the Assembly and Senate. The

officials spoke on the condition
of anonymity because rank-
and-file lawmakers were still
signing off on some provisions.
Under current state law,
assault weapons are defined
by having two features spelled
out in law. The proposal would
reduce that to one feature and
include the popular pistol
grip.
Private sales of assault weap-
ons to someone other than an
immediate family would be
subject to a background check
through a dealer. Also Internet
sales of assault weapons would
be banned, and failing to safely
store a weapon could be subject
to a misdemeanor charge.
' Ammunition magazines
would be restricted to seven
bullets, from the current 10,
and current owners of higher-
capacity magazines would have
a year to sell them outof state.
An owner caught at home with
eight or more bullets in a maga-
zine could face a misdemeanor
charge.

emergency budget
WASHINGTON - House
conservatives opposed to more
deficit spending tried Monday
to chip away at the $50.7 billion
Superstorm Sandy aid package by
requiring offsetting spending cuts
to pay for recovery efforts and by
stripping money for projects they
say are unrelated to the Oct. 29
storm or not urgently needed.
The push by budget hawks for
amendments sets up a fight with
Northeast lawmakers in both par-
ties eager to provide recovery aid
for one of the worst storms ever
to strike the region as the House'
moves toward expected votes
Tuesday on the emergency spend-
ing package.
The base $17 billion bill by the
House Appropriations Commit-

tee is aimed at immediate Sandy
recovery needs, including $5.4
billion for New York and New
Jersey transit systems and $5.4
billion for Federal Emergency
Management Agency's disaster
relief aid fund.
Northeast lawmakerswill have
a chance to add to that bill with
an amendment by Rep. Rodney
Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., for an
additional $33.7 billion, including
$10.9 billion for public transpor-
tation projects.
The Club for Growth, a conser-
vative group, on Monday urged
lawmakers to oppose both Sandy
aid measures.
"Congress shouldn't keep pass-
ing massive 'emergency' relief
bills that aren't paid for, have lit-
tle oversight, and are stuffed with
pork," the club said in a statement.
Sandy aid supporters, none-
theless, voiced confidence Mon-
day they would prevail. The
Senate passed a $60.4 billion

Sany aid package in December
with bipartisan support.
"We have more than enough
votes, I'm confident of that," said
Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., claim-
ing a base of strong support from
Democrats as well as Republicans
from the Northeast and other
states for both the base $17 billion
bill and the amendment for the
additional $33.7 billion.
King said GOP leaders told
him to expect 12 to 15 amend-
ments on the floor. The House
Rules Committee was deciding
which among more than 90 pro-
posed amendments, many from
conservatives seeking to strike
additional aid for past disasters
and some projects not directly
related to Sandy, would advance
to the floor for consideration.
"With that many amendments,
one could sneak through," King
said. "We should be able to
defeat the important amend-
ments, though."

Gunshots fired at Greek party HQ

No injuries at New
Democracy Party
in Athens.
ATHENS, Greece (AP) - A
gunman fired a spray of bullets at
the headquarters of Greece's gov-
erning center-right New Democ-
racy party near central Athens
early Monday, with one hitting
an office occasionally used by the
prime minister, officials said. No
one was hurt.
A government spokesman said
the shooting was part of an effort
to "terrorize" Greek society,
which is struggling through its
worst financial crisis in two gen-
erations amid a drastic fall in liv-
ing standards and a record rise in
unemployment.
Police cordoned off the area
where unknown gunman shot at
least nine automatic rifle rounds
at the building on the capital's
busy Syngrou Avenue, south of
the city center.
No group claimed responsi-
bility for the pre-dawn attack,
which follows a renewed wave of
low-scale politically motivated
violence by small'anarchist and
far-left militants.
The belt-tightening, amid
widespread disgust with an
incompetent and often corrupt

political establishment blamed
for the country's woes, has boost-
ed extremists both to the left and
right of the political spectrum. A
fringe ultra-right group accused
of fostering violent attacks on
dark-skinned immigrants is rep-
resented in Parliament and regu-
larly polls as the country's third
most popular party.
All political parties con-
demned Monday's attack.
"No act of terrorism is going
to scare us," said Makis Voridis,
a spokesman for New Democ-
racy. "Our efforts to restore law
and order ... will continue unob-
structed."
His comments appeared to
be a reference to recent police
evacuations of anarchist squats
in Athens, which triggered
a series of firebomb attacks
on journalists' homes, local
branches of parties in Greece's
governing coalition and cash
machines.
Government spokesman
Simos Kedikoglou said a "sym-
bolic" bullet went through
the window of the office used
occasionally by Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras and was found
inside the room.
"There is a new worrying
increase in efforts to terrorize
our society," Kedikoglou said.
No party officials were in the

building at the time. The offi-
cial prime minister's office is at
another building in central Ath-
ens, where he spends most of his
time.
"Of course there could have
been (victims). There could have
been a cleaner in the prime min-
ister's office or a security guard
at the site," Kedikoglou said.
Police said the attacker was
believed to have had at least
one accomplice, while experts
were examining a car found
abandoned and burned near the
scene. The anti-terrorism squad
is heading the investigation.
New Democracy heads a
three-party coalition govern-
ment formed after elections in
June and is -leading Greece's
painful economic recovery effort
to cut its high public debt and
budget deficit through deeply
resented spending cuts and tax
hikes.
The austerity measures were
demanded by international cred-
itors in exchange for the vital
bailout loans that have shielded
Greece from bankruptcy since
May 2010.
For decades, Greece was
plagued by deadly far-left
political violence that targeted
police, government officials,
businessmen and financial
institutions.

Assad bombs Damascus
suburbs to keep rebels at bay

Civilian casualties
in government air
raid Monday
BEIRUT (AP) - The Syr-
ian government bombed areas
around Damascus on Monday
as part of its push to keep rebel
fighters out of the capital, leav-
ing many children among the
dozens killed, anti-regime activ-
ists said.
An international aid organiza-
tion cited such raids, along with
rape and widespread destruc-
tion, as key factors in the exo-
dus of more than a half-million
Syrians to neighboring coun-
tries since the conflict began in
March 2011.
The International Rescue
Committee said it could be
"months, if not years" before the
refugees can return home and
warned that Syria's ci'il war
could enflame tensions in the
Middle East.
After nearly two years of vio-
lence, it appears unlikely that
the war will end soon. Although
rebels seeking to oust President
Bashar Assad have made gains in
the country's north and east and
outside of Damascus, they have
yet to seriously challenge his
hold on the capital or other parts
of the country.
Earlier this month, Assad dis-
missed calls from the U.S. and
others that. he step down and
vowed to keep fighting until the
country is free of "terrorists" -
his government's shorthand for
rebels.
International diplomacy has
done little to bridge the gap.
In a report released Monday,
the International Rescue Com-
mittee painted a grim picture of
what life has become for Syrians
in war-torn areas.
Syrians face brutal killings,
arbitrary arrests, torture, fre-
quent airstrikes, sexual violence
and diminishing medical servic-
es, the report said.
The 32-page report, based on
interviews with Syrian refugees
in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and

Iraq in November 2012, said-that
many who fled the country cited
rape as a primary reason.
"Many women and girls
relayed accounts of being
attacked in public or in their
homes, primarily by armed
men," the report said. "These
rapes, sometimes by multiple
perpetrators, often occur in
front of family members."
The group did not say if the.
alleged perpetrators were rebels
or government forces.
Anti-regime activists have
reported rapes by government
soldiers or pro-government
thugs, and U.N. war crimes
investigators reported in August
that government forces and
allied militias were responsible
for murders, rapes and indis-
criminate attacks on civilians.
The report warned that vio-
lence could keep Syria's refu-
gees in neighboring countries
for years, taxing the resources of
host governments and enflam-
ing domestic tensions, particu-
larly in Jordan and Lebanon. It
called for greater international
aid in and outside of Syria as
well as open borders to allow
those threatened by violence to
escape.
Violence continued inside
Syria on Monday, as government
fighter jets carried out lethal air-
strikes on rebellious areas near
the capital, Damascus.
One strike hit the suburb of
Moadamiyeh, blasting the walls
off apartment blocks and scatter-
ing rubble in the streets. Activ-
ist videos posted online showed
residents searching for survi-
vors and wrapping dead bodies
in blankets. One video showed
two corpses lying face down,
one covered in gray cement dust.
Another showed the bodies of
six children laid out on a floor.
The videos appeared genuine
and corresponded to other Asso-
ciated Press reporting.
The Britain-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights
said 13 people were killed in the
Moadamiyeh blast, eight chil-
dren and five women. The group,
which relies on contacts in Syria,

also reported deadly airstrikes
in two other suburbs, saying at
least 45 people were killed in
and around the capital Monday,
including 10 rebel fighters.
The Syrian government
offered its own account of the
blast in Moadamiyeh, saying
"terrorists" fired a shell at the
neighborhood, hitting a resi-
dential building and causing an
undefined number of casualties.
The destruction in the vid-
eos, however, appeared consis-
tent with an airstrike, not a shell
attack.
Rebel fighters said the strike
on Moadamiyeh came amid a
government offensive to push
rebel fighters from there and the
adjacent southwest suburb of
Daraya.
Rebels moved into the two
suburbs weeks ago, but have
been bogged down in clashes
with government troops since
then. Both areas put rebel forces
within striking distance of a key
military airport in the Mezzeh
neighborhood.
The Observatory said Monday
that the government had blown
up homes between the airport
and the neighborhoods to estab-
lish a buffer zone.
One fighter in the area
reached Monday said the gov-
ernment appeared set on push-
ing the rebels out.
"The noise from the bom-
bardment is astounding today,"
said the fighter, who gave only
his first name, Iyad, for security
reasons. "The regime is using all
kinds of weaponry."
The U.N. says that more than
60,000 people have been killed
since Syria's crisis began with
anti-regime protests. The con-
flict has since descended into
civil war, with rebel brigades
across the country fighting
Assad's forces.
International diplomacy has
failed to end the conflict.
On Monday, the secretary gen-
eral of NATO said the alliance
had no plans to intervene in Syria,
warning that foreign interven-
tion could have "unpredictable
regional repercussions."

Coroner releases new report on
Natalie Wood's mysterious death

Possibility of
violence before
drowning in 1981
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Some
of the bruises found on Natalie
Wood's body may have occurred
before the actress drowned in the
waters off Southern California
more than 30 years ago, accord-
ing to a newly released coroner's
report on one of Hollywood's
most mysterious deaths.
The case took another twist
Monday when officials released a
10-page addendum to Wood's 1981
autopsy that cites unexplained
bruises and scratches on Wood's
face and arms as significant fac-
tors that led to officials chang-
ing her death certificate last year
from a drowning to "drowning
and other undetermined factors."
Officials were careful about
their conclusions because they
lacked several pieces of evidence
for their review.
Bruises on Wood's arms, a
scratch on her neck and superfi-
cial abrasions to the actress' face
may have occurred before Wood
ended up in the waters off Cata-
lina Island in November 1981,
but coroner's officials wrote they
could not definitely determine
when the injuries occurred.
The findings have not altered
a sheriff's department investiga-
tion into Wood's death, which a
spokesman described as ongoing.
Wood, 43, was on a yacht with
her actor-husband Robert Wag-
ner, co-star Christopher Walken

and the boat captain on Thanks-
giving weekend in 1981 before
somehow ending up in the water.
A dinghy that had been attached
to the boat was found along the
island's shoreline, but investiga-
tors could not locate it to review
it last year.
Investigators initially reported
that there were scratches on its
hull, but Wood's fingernails were
not preserved for analysis.
The initial autopsy report said
it was likely the bruises happened
when Wood drowned. "Most of
the bruises on the body are super-
ficial and probably sustained at
the time of drowning," the initial
autopsy report stated.
Several of the original coro-
ner's investigators who worked on
the case were re-interviewed, and
officials attempted to test some
items taken during the investi-
gation into Wood's death and an
autopsy, but they could not be
located.
"The locationofthe bruises,the
multiplicity of the bruises, lack of
head trauma, or facial bruising
support bruising having occurred
prior to entry in the water," the
amended report states. "Since
there are unanswered questions
and limited additional evidence
available for evaluation, it is
opined by this Medical Examiner
that the manner of death should
be left as undetermined," Chief
Medical Examiner Dr. Laksh-
manan Sathyavagiswaran wrote
in the report completed in June.
Officials also considered that
Wood wasn't wearing a life jack-
et and had no history of suicide

attempts and didn't leave a note
as reasons to amend itsreport and
the death certificate.
The report was released
Monday after sheriff's officials
released asecurityhold.
Sheriff's spokesman Steve
Whitmore said the agency has
known about the findings in the

said Wagner is not considered a
suspect in Wood's death and the
agency hasn't said they have any
suspicions about Walken or the
boat captain, Dennis Davern.
Wood, famed for roles in such
films as "West Side Story" and
"Rebel Without a Cause," was
nominated for 'three Academy
Awards during her lifetime. Her
death stunned the world and has
remained one of Hollywood's
most enduring mysteries. The
original detective on the case,
Wagner and Walken have all said
they considered her death an acci-

Conflicting versions of what

the actress died. Wood, Wagner
and Walken had all been drink-

The newly released report

occupants discovered Wood was

time of death was around mid-

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
In a season full of success and
promise, the youthfulness of the
No. 5 Michigan men's basketball
team has been the storyline all
season.
First, it -was freshman guard
Nik Stauskas' impressive shoot-
ing abilities that helped earn him
a spot in the starting five. Then, it
was the development of freshman
forward Mitch McGary in the
post as he lost weight and learned
to control his body. Next, it was
freshman forward Glenn Robin-
son III who went on a hot streak,
scoring at least 10 points per game
in a stretch between Dec. 20 and
Jan. 9. All of the doubts about a
young team struggling early in
the season had slowly disappeared
over the course of the Wolverines'
16-0 start. But after an ugly 56-53
road loss to No. 11 Ohio State on
Sunday, in which Michigan trailed
by as 'much as 21 points, the inex-
perience in a tough conference
game was noticeable.
"I don't like to make excuses
about our young team, but we
found out the way that game
started (Sunday) about the speed
and the strength of the Big Ten,"
said Michigan coach John Beilein.
"Our young guys - and once
again, we have two juniors play-

ing, a sophomore playing and five
freshmen that are playing a lot
of minutes - are going to really
learn how this game is played in
this league very quickly. It will be
a very hands-on experience for
them."
Stauskas, McGary and Robin-
son Have continued their improve-
ments on bot] sides of the ball
through the first few games of
the conference slate. The recent
emergence of freshman guard
Caris LeVert as one of the team's
best defenders coming off the
bench and freshman guard Spike
Albrecht's career performance
against the Buckeyes have made a
case for the Wolverines as one of
the deepest teams in the Big Ten
with eight players - five freshmen
- consistently contributing.
But Sunday was a struggle for
four of the five rookies. Staus-
kas was held scoreless -lie went
0-for-3 - due to sophomore guard
Trey Burke's inability to penetrate
and kick out and Ohio State guard
AaronCraft doing his best to deny
Burke anything in the lane or
passing options on the perimeter.
The Mississauga, Ontario native
got in foul trouble early, too, which
limited his playing time.
"The foul trouble is going
to limit his touches, and Ohio
(State)'s defense is going to limit
his touches as well," Beilein said.

"You don't know (the limits) until
you see it. They did the same thing
last year to some of our guys, and
they locked the rails and make
you play two on two through the
middle.
"We said that between having
Craft and (Evan) Ravenel, those
are tough guys to be able to beat.
They said, 'Somebody else is going
to beat us besides Nik Stauskas.'"
Robinson scored eight points,
close to his average of 12 per game,
but was held to only one rebound.
Coming in from the wing, Rob-
inson is one of the team's great-
est rebounding assets, averaging
almost six per game, but struggled
against a more physical Buckeye
squad.
Stauskas and Robinson, the two
freshman starters, shot a com-
bined 27 percent on Sunday. The
duo, along with Burke and junior
guard Tim Hardaway Jr., have
combined for 59 of Michigan's
average of 79 points per game but
on Sunday, they tallied just 40
points. In addition to Stauskas
and Robinson, McGary, the Wol-
verines' leading rebounder, was
limited on the boards and LeVert
played just nine minutes and
missed both of his free throws.
So as much as the freshmen
struggled on Sunday, how do you
prepare the youngsters=for a chal-
lenging Big Ten road game?

"It's hard to do that," Beilein
said. "We thought we did as much
as we could by playing Arkansas,
by playing North Carolina State,
Kansas State, Pittsburgh, going
to Bradley, you do everything you
can. There's a process, there's
some things in the process that
you can't speed up, no matter what
you do.
"They have really performed
way above what many freshmen
accomplish at this time. (Ohio
State) was too difficult a task."

the Wolverines with scowls and a
bitter taste in their mouths.
"There's a depressing feeling

sophomore forward Alex Guptil.
"It's hard when you're not win-
ning games. The older guys need

Added Copp:"We need to bear
down on chances. We need to
keep working in practice and not
take anything for granted. Some
games we have it (effort) and
some games we don't. We just
need to find that consistency."
Look for Berenson to make
more changes to the lines in
his attempt to find chemistry
between his young athletes.
Though not quantifiable, the
29-year veteran coach is aware of
the ability of players to function
at a better rate together instead
of alone.
"We've got the same cast of
characters really, but we're try-
ing to put players with players on
the lines that need whatever they
bring to the table," Berenson said.
"It might be a player going on the
line that you're not worried about
the line scoring more, you're
worried about them being scored
on, or you're worried about them
being out-worked."
It's worth noting that even
with the changes, the top line
of Copp, Hyman and senior for-
ward A.J. Treais finished with

a minus-one rating on Saturday
night. The lineup, however, has
spent limited time together, most
of it coming on the power play
that struggled mightily over the
weekend.
"I wouldn't say we have a first
line or a second line," Berenson
said. "Our lines are fairly well
balanced. You look in terms of
experience, in terms of work
ethic, in terms of physicality, in
terms of offensive skill, I'm look-
ing at all those things. But I'm
also looking at two guys that can
carry a line and compliment a
third player."
The goaltending core is also
failing to produce consistently,
as no candidate has managed to
solidify the position. Keep an eye
out inthe upcomingweeks for the
head coach to keep giving Jane-
cyk and Racine chances, wait-
ing for one to. gain the hot hand.
Berenson could also be prompted
to insert freshman goaltender
Jared Rutledge into the starting
sport in the hope that a fresh face
may be all that's needed.
"We're not giving up on any-
one," Berenson said. "We're look-
ing for life from our goalies."
Most of all, look at the faces
of each athlete, as they surely
won't have a smile until they put
together a winning streak. For
now, they won't be starting their
days with the sunny outlook
Berenson's mug encourages.

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico has the Wolverines ranked for the first
time since 2002.

"Fuck yo couch."
A$-ARP Rocky living large
on lavish debut LP

Harlem rapper's
original sound finds
mainstream success
By TOM KLEPACZ
Daily Arts Writer
The first real glimpse the
world received of A$AP Rocky
was entirely characteristic of
his personal-
ity. Through a
shifting, tech-
nicolored lens, A$AP Rocky
Rocky glared
at his audience LOI1&UVe"A$AP
and laconically RCA
mouthed words
to what would
become his first hit single, "Pur-
ple Swag." The video - or song,
for that matter - didn't offer any
definite hints to who Rocky would
be as a person or rapper. He was
good-looking and well-dressed
(and knew it), but he didn't make
that the center of the video. He
mimicked Houston rap as only a
rap nerd could, buthe wasn't geeky
in the slightest. He seemed to view
the world around himlike he knew
he was somehow different from it
all, but he embraced it and drank
from the same 40s as his sur-
rounding Harlem friends. He was

simply cool, and that was all.
"Purple Swag" now has nearly
18-million YouTube views. Rocky
has been featured in countless
magazines, from Complex to
Vogue. He's even featured in the
"FIFA 13" video game ad, along
with none other than the newly
crowned Snoop Lion ('Dogg'
for those who don't keep up
with his Rastafarianism). From
humble codeine-laced begin-
nings, Rocky's propelled himself
to the throne of worldwide cool.
The only thing he had to do was
release a great commercial album..
Long.Live.A$AP seems to
be surprisingly reflective of
Rocky's enigmatic rise to fame.
The album's first track (aptly
titled "Long Live A$AP") begins
with ominous Castlevania-
esque thunder claps and stum-
bling synth, as if Rocky is arising
from the dungeons of Harlem
- a world in which the rapper
thought he'd "Probably die in
prison." The track thumps like
any other rap hit, but has hints of
surrealism and even psychede-
lia: Crawling strings maneuver
their way around the tremen-
dous 808s, and Rocky's chorus
maintains the track's melody
with gentle guitar and his own
falsetto. Yes, he sings it.

After the opening song con-
cludes, the album quickly jumps
to the other end of Rocky's spec-
trum, from the dark and some-
what surreal title track to the
lavish landscape of "Goldie."
Even though the two tracks dif-
fer entirely in both content and
sound ("Goldie" is produced by
the famed "Ni**as in Paris" pro-
ducer Hit-Boy, a seemingly eter-
nal hit-maker), Rocky somehow
makes the contrast work. His
claim that "It feels good waking
up to money in the bank" seems
genuine, like every one of his
mornings is truly a celebratory
occasion.
Rocky miraculously "makes
it work" on several occasions on
his debut LP. Whether it's on the
2 Chainz-carried "F*ckin Prob-
lems" or the Skrillex-produced
(yes, Skrillex-produced) "Wild
For the Night," Rocky makes the
seemingly generic interesting. As
the rapper himself said in a recent
Pitchfork interview, "What other
rapper could collab with Skrillex
and not make it sound corny?"
Cocky, yes, but he's absolutely
right.
Long.Live.A$AP isn't all pop
either - songs like the echo-
ing "LVL" and bouncing "Fash-
ion Killa" are simultaneously

peculiar and entirely listenable.
"LVL" offers the usual underwa-
ter symphony sounds of its pro-
ducer, Clams Casino, a man who
can somehow balance Rocky's
stuttering Bone Thugs-flow
with Gregorian-esque chanting.
"Fashion Killa" is perhaps the
strangest song on the album -
the beat seems to place the rap-
per in a sonic Barbie-Land where
obscure, super-high-end fashion
labels (Isabel Marant, Raf Simons,
Helmut Lang, among others) are
the only substance to life - and
Rocky somehow seems right at
home.
The album has its pitfalls
- "Jodye" and "Angels" are
essentially the same vague diss-
song with slightly different
beats, and they're both placed
confusingly near the album's
conclusion - but in its greater
entirety, Long.Live.A$AP is
a superb debut album. Rocky
manages to juggle both his
druggy Harlem beginnings and
FIFA commercial superstardom
with ease, as if he were destined
for mainstream-TV stardom but
would rather drink 40s with his
friends on a smoke-enveloped
Harlem couch. Who knows,
maybe he'll also juggle a Gram-
my soon.

The Daily's "Best Of"
edition in the B-side
has come and gone, and
with it our official judgment of
this year's musical harvest. In
the future
(even the
near future),
we'll look
back on our
top-10 list as
a snapshot of
our collective
perception ELLIOT
of the music ALPERN
industry at
large, won-
dering why some were ever
favored (and unsung others never
picked). Yet overall, our "Best Of"
edition accomplishes no small
feat: Itaggregates the opinion of
all of our writers (and differences
of opinion are in no short supply
therein).
And as much as I enjoy seeing
our official impression of the past
year at large, I rarely ever take
them seriously. We've written
about the fallacy of the "best" of
anything before (recently, even).
At least to me, there's a pervasive,
fatal flaw in the core function
of picking any "best of" list and
publishing it for the masses, one
that compromises any trust you'd
like to place in such authoritative
opinions.
Reason it out yourself: As a
music writer, you're about to
tell the world your fundamental
opinions on music as a whole.
Composing a list without any bias
(or distortion), people will sud-
denlyknowyour deepest secrets
and weirdest musical compul-
sions. And how much respect
would be lost if a guilty pleasure
like Taylor Swift soared above
Frank Ocean or Beach House.
Speakingofwhich, though
those albums are wholly deserv-
ing of being recognized, a bias
tends to fester as the list gets
put together. Albums deemed
too close to the edge of "popular
appeal" are often downgraded or
passed over altogether, due to the
unreliability of a list (though, no,

Taylor Swift, I still don't think
you're on the list).
In any case, this column is my
short stab in the dark at doing
justice, at talking about the year
in music - at least what's really
worth talking about. Just like any
music writer, I'm limited to the
music I like but I'm willing, at the
very least, to simply share whatI
enjoyed - the good, the bad and
the catchy.
There's been one snub left
from the Daily's list that's been
on my mind a lot. I shouldn't be
shocked - amid ultra-hip acts
like Beach House, Grimes and
Tame Impala, I didn't expect to
find anything beside the band
names that felt sexy to name-
drop in a music discussion.
But Mumford & Sons' Babel,
while not perfect, was nonethe-
less a decently high pick in my
own best of list. Critics tended to
make the same case - that they
sound too similar to Sigh No More
(cue the obligatory joke where
they all get each other banjos
for Christmas). But there's more
than enough worth savinghere,
from a spot-on rendition of Simon
and Garfunkel's "The Boxer"
to the sometimes haunting and
often contemplative "Where Are
You Now," "Holland Road" and
"Below My Feet."
No one will
remember that
list in a year.

And I have very little doubt
that musical elitism led to the
omission of two of indie's best
releases in2012: Passion Pit's
Gossamer and Of Monster and
Men's My Head Is An Animal.
After all, no one wants to seem
like the frat bros who pumped
"Sleepyhead" from every grimy
speaker of their house. But even
aside from the crowd-pleasers
like "Take a Walk" and "Carried
Away" (which, honestly, tend to
please a crowd quite well), Pas-
sion Pit's Michael Angelakos
manages to imbue a surprising
amount of soul into his material.
Set "Constant Conversations" on
repeat for a fewtimes, tune in
and drop out - fade into the pink
mist suggested by the album's
cover.
Of Monsters and Men is
admittedly almost indieenough
to be a trendy pick for the year
- in fact, it was close to clawing
its way into placing for a low spot
on the list. But alas, the Icelandic
folksters' gifted vocals and infec-
tious melodies were beat out by
another indie group - the much
more American/pop-friendly
fun.
Speaking of which, it seems
as though we tend to run into
another problem with pick-
ing the best music: We select
based on what we feel like we
should pick. The success of fun.,
coupled with the group's unique
indie sound, made it seemingly
worth the inclusion - after all,
how could someone skip over
the album that gave us "Some
Nights" and the anthemic "We
Are Young"?
Here's the counterargument:
Why else would we pick it? I
too fell prey to this illusion,
even giving itSa low spot on my
list, before coming to: It's nota
great album. It's an okay album
speckled with a few genuine
gems - so yes, those songs are
perhaps some of the best singles
of the'year. But will I really be
listening to the deep tracks of
Some Nights in a few years? I
doubt it.
Overall, I'm excited for the
coming year and the inevitable
Best of 2013. Because, while the
lists are imperfect, they're not
always wrong. After all, what
was my own best album of the
year? Undeniably Kendrick
Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d. city.
As they say, even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

best of lists. To stop him,

revelers). In the documentary,
"Chasing Ice," photographer
and adventurer James Balog
("ICE: Portraits of the World's
Vanishing Glaciers") sets out to
prove to naysayers that human
influence is the explanation to
climate change, and denial is not
an option.
In 2007, Balog traveled to
more than 30 glaciers in Iceland,
Greenland, Alaska and Montana
and set up time-lapse cameras
to chronicle the chillingly rapid
decay of these glaciers, which
he argues is ultimately the
result of CO2 and other chemi-
cal emissions. Through visu-
ally arresting videography and
