The event, which lasted from

speakers who discussed trans-

and other areas in relation to the
event's theme of "Inform Trans-

"What we really made sure to
look for this year was people that
had a compelling and inspiring
story to tell as, opposed to just
an impressive resume," Rhodes
said.
TED, an acronym for Technol-
ogy, Entertainment and Design,
began 26 years ago in California
as a four-day conference, and
has since ventured globally as an
initiative to promote inspiration
and challenge norms in political,
educational and social realms.
At the conference, speakers
had only 18 minutes and a Pow-
erPoint presentation to develop
and share new ideas with the

audience. Speakers often share
inspirational stories and typi-
cally hail from the backgrounds
of medicine, music and the arts.
During the event, Joe
Trumpey, associate professor in
the School of Art &Design, spoke
about his personal sustainability
efforts. He described his man-

Event educates women on
impact of health care reform

Organizations

discussion on
gender disparities
By ALICIA ADAMCYZK
Daily Staff Reporter
Amid pink posters advo-
cating for reproductive rights
and stacks of papers detailing

the benefits of comprehensive
health care coverage, about 30
women banded together yester-
day at an event meant to educate
women about current health
care disparities in the United
States.
The event, titled "Addressing
the Disparity: The Affordable
Care Act, Women, and Com-
munities of Color," was a col-
laboration between Planned
Parenthood Advocates of Mich-
igan and the University's Stu-

dents for Choice activist group.
Lindsay Maas, a field organizer
for PPAM, said the forum was
intended to provide a comfort-
able place for women to discuss
health care issues and learn
about the health care reforms.
"We want to be able to
reframe the discourse around
the Affordable Care Act and
start to get messaging out in the
communities that this is really
beneficial," Maas said.

Iran, Turkey disagree
on Syrian leadership

Politicians visit Neb. plant
where 'pink slime' is made

Countries grapple
over keeping Assad
staying in power
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Iranian
and Turkish leaders exchanged
sharply opposing views yester-
day as they discussed how to deal
with the crisis in Syria.
Iranian Supreme Leader Aya-
tollah Ali Khamenei said Teh-
ran strongly supports reforms
in Syria under President Bashar
Assad, but visiting Turkish
prime minister said Assad can't
be trusted and must step down.
The unusual public acknowl-
edgment of sharp differences
between the two neighbors came
on the second day of a state visit
to Iran by Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Erdogan arrived in Tehran

from South Korea, where he
attended a nuclear security sum-
mit and had talks with President
Barack Obama.
Iran is Syria's closest ally, and
Tehran has staunchly backed
Assad during Syria's year-long
uprising.
"Iran will defend Syria because
of (its) support of the resistance
front against the Zionist regime
and is strongly opposed to any
interference by foreign forces in
Syria's internal affairs," Khame-
nei told Erdogan. "The Islamic
Republic of Iran is categorically
opposed to any plan initiated by
the U.S. regarding Syria."
Khamenei rejected Turkey's
position that Assad must step
down.
"We support reforms in Syria.
-The reforms that began in Syria
need to continue," state TV quot-
ed Khamenei as saying.

It was not clear how Erdogan
responded to Khamenei, but
hours later he told Iran's state
TV that Assad's regime can't be
trusted.
"If Assad doesn't fear (an elec-
tion), he should give a ballot box
to the people and let parties take
shape. (Assad's) Baath should
not form a party and must be
regarded as a thing of the past,"
Erdogan said. "We can't put the
previous years in front of us."
The U.N. says the year-long
conflict in Syria has left more
than 9,000 people dead.
Turkey is set to host about 60
countries, including the United
States, for a "Friends of the Syr-
ian People" conference in Istan-
bul on Sunday. The participants
will discuss ways to further iso-
late and pressure Assad, as well
as measures to support the Syr-
ian opposition.

Honduran inmates riot, 14
dead after ensuing prison fire

governors and two

SOUTH SIOUX CITY, Neb.
(AP) - Governors of three states
donned coats, hair nets and gog-
gles to tour a main production
plant for "pink slime" Thursday,
hoping to persuade grossed-out
consumers and grocery stores to
accept the processed beef trim-
mings are as safe as the industry
insists.
Three governors and two lieu-
tenant governors spent about a
half-hour touring Beef Products
Inc.'s plant to show their support
for the company and the thou-
sands of jobs it creates in Nebras-
ka, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota
and Texas.
"It's beef, but it's leaner beef,
which is better for you," Iowa
Gov. Terry Branstad said after
watching a presentation of how
the textured beef product is
made and taking a walking tour
of the plant.
Beef Products, the main pro-
ducer of the cheap lean beef
made from fatty bits of meat
left over from other cuts, has
drawn extra scrutiny because of
concerns about the ammonium
hydroxide it treats meat with
to slightly change the acidity of
the beef and kill bacteria. The
company suspended operations
at plants in Texas, Kansas and
Iowa this week, affecting 650
jobs, but it defends its product
as safe.
While the official name is lean
finely textured beef, critics dub
it "pink slime" and say it's an
unappetizing example of indus-
trialized food production. That
term was coined by a federal
microbiologist who was grossed
out by it, but the product meets
federal food safety standards
and has been used for years.

the plant - Branstad, Texas.

Similar incident
occured in another
prison six weeks ago
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras
(AP) - At least14 people died dur-
ing an uprising by armed inmates
at a Honduran prison Thursday,
one of them decapitated and the
others killed by a fire started by
the rioters, authorities said.
The unrest came six weeks
after a fire at another prison in
Honduras killed 361 inmates. A
fire official said the toll from the
latest blaze could rise.
Yair Mesa, police commissioner
of the rough northern city of San
Pedro Sula, said Thursday's riot
had been brought under control.
"The uprising has been put
down without the need to fire
shots," Mesa said by telephone

from inside the prison.
He said most of the victims
apparently died of burns or
asphyxiation, but said the cause
of death could not immediately
be determined because the bodies
were so badly burned. One pris-
oner's head was cut off and tossed
outside the prison during the riot.
Inmates carried the burned
bodies from the site of the blaze
and set them out in the prison
yard.
National fire chief Alfonso
Medina warned that the death
toll could increase, saying one.
part of the prison was still under
control of inmates who might
have grenades and not been
searched by security officers. He
said there could be as many as six
more victims, although he didn't
give details on how that number
was reached.
City fire chief Jose Danilo

Flores said the prisoners them-
selves appeared to have fought
the fire inside the facility. He said
the armed inmates initially kept
firefighters from entering. .
San Pedro Sula is believed to be
one of the most dangerous cities
in a country that'has the highest
homicide rate in the world. A fire
at the San Pedro Sula prison in
2004 killed 107 inmates.
Thursday's uprising came a
month and a half after Honduras'
overcrowded prisons were hit
by the worst prison fire in a cen-
tury - a Feb. 14 conflagration at
the Comayagua farm prison that
killed 361 inmates.
In 2008, the latest year for
which figures are available, Hon-
duras' prison system had nearly
38 percent more prisoners than
it was built to house, according to
the London-based International
Centre for Prison Studies.

Gov. Rick Perry, Kansas Gov.
Sam Brownback, Nebraska Lt.
Gov. Rick Sheehy and South
Dakota Lt. Gov. Matt Michels -
all agree with the industry view
that pink slime has been unfairly
maligned and mislabeled and
issued a joint statement earlier
saying the product is safe.
The officials spent about 20
minutes going over the produc-
tion process in a separate room
at the plant with Craig Letch,
the company's director of qual-
ity assurance, viewing and han-
dling more than a dozen slabs of
raw meat and the processed, fin-
ished product laid out on a round
wooden table.
None of the officials tasted
the product during the tour, but.
Branstad and Perry were among
those munching on burgers

made from t at a news conference
afterward.
"It's lean. It's good. It's nutri-
tious," Branstad said as he pol-
ished off a patty, sans bun.
The politicians defended
the plant and the product, and
accused the media of creating
a controversy over a product
because of the name critics gave
it.
"If you called itfinely textured
lean beef, would we be here?"
asked Sheehy.
The officials donned hard
hats, hair nets and goggles for a
brief walking tour of the facility.
Workers manned conveyor belts
of meat cuts that ran from one
side of the room to the other in
the chilled room; the ammonium
hydroxide treatment process was
not visible.

DETROIT
City Council
debates financial
deal with state
Recently negotiated labor
contracts could be nullified
under terms of a financial stabil-
ity agreement between the city
of Detroit and the state that was
being debated yesterday by the
City Council.
Council members said they
would not vote on the proposed
agreement yesterday evening,
and asked their legal department
to look into the language.
The agreement amounts to a
consent deal that lays out how
Detroit plans to work its way
from a $200 million budget defi-
cit and long-term structural debt.
The proposed agreement calls
for existing concessions to be
approved by two new directors
and a financial advisory board,
and the City Council cannot
approve the existing union agree-
ments if the pact with the state is
signed.

Utah teens' naked
run inspired by
American Pie'
Four Utah teens armed with a
BB gun told deputies they were
inspired by a scene from an
"American Pie" movie when they
went running naked through an
Ogden-area neighborhood.
Authorities said Wednesday
the teens were spotted streak-
ing in the residential community
about 45 minutes north of Salt
Lake City at about 2 a.m. Sunday.
When a deputy responded, a
17-year-old girl ducked behind a
tree, while the three teenage boys
kept running and were found
shortly after.
The teens said they brought the
BB gun because they feared they
would be attacked by deer during
the jog.

The Obama administration is

while authorities review thou-

to indefinitely delay deportation
proceedings for many non-crim-

The dockets in Detroit, New
Orleans, Orlando, and Seattle will
be suspended during the review
cases involving illegal immi-
grants not held in immigration
and Customs Enforcement custo-
dy, the Department of Homeland
Security said Thursday.
ICE previously reviewed 11,682

recommended suspending more

than 1,600 cases in those two
cities. The reviews are part of an
Obama administration pledge to
focus deportation resources on
criminal immigrants and those
who pose a national security or

0 minister resigns
amid Saudi row
Sweden's defense minister
stepped down yesterday, citing
the pressure he has faced from
the country's media over leaked
plans to build a weapons plant in
Saudi Arabia.
Sten Tolgfors denied any
wrongdoing . and insisted the
plans to help Saudi Arabia build
a facility for anti-tank weapons
were consistent with a 2005 mili-
tary agreement between the two
countries.
Tolgfors, defense minister
in the center-right government
since 2007, said he had planned to
resign anyway, though at a later
date.
"The media reports in recent
weeks have facilitated and has-
tened my decision," he told

movements for solidarity around
the world.
LSA senior Abbas Alawieh,
education chair for SAFE, said
the organization decided to par-
ticipate in the hunger strike at
its meeting on Wednesday night.
While only one student was
asked to participate, Alawieh
said about 25 members agreed to
strike.
Members wore orange ribbons
around their arms in solidarity of
the international hunger strike,
and Alawieh said the strike raised
awareness for the more than 300
Palestinian prisoners being held
without charge in Israeli prisons.
"Unfortunately, a lot of these
prisoners have had to resort to

the hunger strikes, and Hana isn't
the first to do a hunger strike,"
Alawieh said. "This is something
that has been employed by pris-
oners of countries for several
years, but her story in specific has
touched our group and groups
across the world."
According to SAFE's website,
the group's mission is to "pro-
mote justice, human rights, liber-
ation, and self-determination for
the Palestinian people." Alawieh
said SAFE represents all individ-
uas who endure the difficulties
Shalabi has faced.
"Our stance here at SAFE is
we oppose indefinite detentions
withoutctrials for anyone, regard-
less of if it was Hana or anyone in
the world," Alawieh said. "This is
something that is fundamentally
wrong."
During the group's hunger
strike, Shalabi ended her 43-day
hunger strike after Israelis
agreed to extradite her to the
Gaza Strip, accordingto the BBC.
LSA senior Mohammed-Ali
Abazeed said at first, he was
excited that Shalabi ended her
strike, but upon hearing the
terms of her release, he wasn't
satisfied since she will be unable
to return to her home in the West
Bank.
"My initial reaction was that it
was great, but as soon as Ilogged
on and read the story, it really
wasn't excitement at all," Aba-
zeed said. "If anything, this is a

online streams of past TEDTalks,
and said she was pleased that her
personal experience with the
organization has helped yield
creative discovery.
"The more creative you are,
the more success you can have. I
think TED fosters that," Tao said.
Architecture and Urban Plan-
ning senior Sabrina Wang, who
has attended two previous TEDx
conferences, including TEDxTai-
pei in Taiwan, said she was also
pleased with the event and its
ability to allow her to apply its
messages to her currentacademic
ventures.
"Combining passion with
research and technology togeth-
er is great," Wangsaid.
LSA sophomore Mike Perles, a
TEDxUofM team member, said it
was his firstcyear at the event.
"(TEDxUofM is) showcasing
how incredible people affiliated
with U of M are, and how inspir-
ing their ideas can be," Perles
said.
Perles said individuals must

demographic.
"Any club that brings African
Americans to Ann Arbor is going
to be targeted," Farinha said.
"It's a formula that they're using
for nuisance abatement action to
intimidate and harass legitimate
businesses."
According to Engineering
senior MJ Gellada, a member
of the Filipino American Stu-
dent Association, FASA and the
Chinese Student Association
encountered difficulties with the
club during a benefit dinner in
November 2008, in which they
made an agreement with club
owners that their groups would
receive half of the cover charges.
Gellada claims that Dream
Nite Club only counted Asians
who participated, and -divid-
ed the cover funds based on
that number, rather than total
attendees. CSA and FASA lead-
ers confronted the club owners,
and an argument ensued during
which the owners began using
derogatory terms for female stu-
dents in attendance.
"What happened in short was
racial stereotyping," Gellada
said. "They didn't handle them-
possible worse situation than it
is now with what they agreed to-
do ... she's basically being trans-
ferred from one prison to another
in many senses of the situation."
LSA sophomore Suha Najjar,
a SAFE member who participat-
ed in the hunger strike, said her
father was held asa political pris-
oner in Israel for a year in 1988,
noting that her uncles have also
been held as prisoners. Though
her father never went on a hun-
ger strike while in prison, Najjar
said she felt a connection to him
through her experience yester-
day.
Najjar was unable to inform
her family, who live in the Pal-
estinian territories, about her
efforts to raise awareness due to
power outages caused by Israeli
bombings at power plants. She
said she intends to continue to
raise awareness about Shalabi's

situation and that of over 300
other Palestinian prisoners held
without charges in Israeli pris-
ons.
"On campus, I'm a very active
member of SAFE and stuff like
this is the number one thing:
raising awareness," Najjar said.

was the promotion of a sense of

said.

Ultimately, Gellada said nei-

from the club.
In a separate incident in June
2011, injuries incurred dur-
ing fights at the club sent three
patrons to the hospital and a
22-year-old man was also shot in

City Attorney Stephen
Postema said Dream Nite-
club admitted to two counts
of "allowing the annoying or
molesting of customers" last
September in relation to the
fights, for which the club was
fined $600 dollars.
Despite the multiple inci-
dents, Farinha said he believes
Dream Niteclub will win their
lawsuit against the city because
the city's current and previous
allegations have no basis.
"They have no evidence
except police officers' state-
ments which are hearsay,"
Farinha said. "I'm not worried,
we're goingto win."
Postema declined to comment
on all legal situations involving
Dream Niteclub because of the
ongoing litigation.
hers of the group to participate,
members of SAFE spoke about
their experiences duringthe day.
Among the participants, LSA
senior and SAFE member Abdal-
lah Ali explained that while
he did grow wary during the 11
hours, raising awareness and
striking with the other members
motivated him to continue.
"Honestly, today, there was
a period of time when I did get
tired, but it wasn't that bad," Ali
said. "There was aslot of stuff on
Twitter about Hana today and
I was like, 'You know what? I
can't not do this.' So I just kept
going... it's nice that we could all
come together."
LSA senior Bilal Baydoun,
one of the SAFE co-chairs, said
Shalabi's situation was benefi-
cial in raising awareness about
the widespread issue of admin-
istrative detention. He added

that it was also personally ben-
eficial in connecting himself to
the larger issue.
"(The experience) is more
humbling," Baydoun said. "You
feel really small about when you
think about what (Shalabi) went
through ... It really puts it all
in perspective, and it helps you
realize the little pain you felt
today is just a drop in the bucket,
more or less."

said.
Monts added that he is con-
fident that the University will
experience an increase in diver-
sity because of its strong com-
mitment to multiculturalism.
"I believe those that come
after us will be celebrating the
50th year of this office's work in
the future," Monts said.
The symposium concluded
with a student panel consist-
ing of members of various cul-
tural campus groups such as the

ciation and the Latino Students

The event featured a docu-
mentary called "A Vital Service,"
which emphasized Planned Par-
enthood's support for minority
and low-income communities.
Following the documentary, a
panel comprised of community
leaders, public health experts
and reproductive rights advo-
cates discussed the inadequate
health care access that many
minority women face.
Trudy Hall, program man-
ager of the University of Michi-
gan Health System's Program
for Multicultural Health, said
health care options for minority
women in Washtenaw County
are limited.
"(For) most racial and ethnic
minorities, we're doing pretty
bad on health statistics," Hall
said. "We just don't have the
resources."
Anika Fassia, a policy ana-
lyst for the Michigan League
for Human Services, said while
minority wonen face the great-
est health care disparities, the
issue transcends race.
- "Our fates are linked," Fassia
said. "Our next generations are
going to be increasingly people of
color ... and that's why you should
care. Itcis your burden."
After the panel, Wafa Dinaro,
the Michigan Consumers for
Healthcare communications
director, emphasized the impor-
tance of several provisions in
the health law. Specifically, she
discussed the policy's insurance
exchange program, protection
from annual or lifetime limits on
care and its mandated increase in
the number of premium dollars
that insurance companies must

to them and discussed how to
increase multicultural connec-
tions across the University.
LSA senior Chatoris Jones,
a member of IMMAD, said he
aims to encourage students to
attend events of different cul-
tures.
"We can't grow (if) we stay
in our own community," Jones
said. "You have to be able to
experience other cultures, and
it's not just a black and white
thing."
Jones also posed questions to
faqulty and students in the audi-
ence to encourage critical think-
ing of the University's diversity
and ways to improve it.
"How do we create that culti-
vating community that is Mich-
igan?" Jones asked. "When we
say the diversity of Michigan,
we're not talking about race,
we're talking about ideas."
put toward health care expenses.
"Starting this year, all insur-
ance companies have to spend 80
percent of your premium dollars
on health care needs," Dinaro
said. "If they don't, at the end
of the year, you will get a rebate
check."
Dinaro added that the Afford-
able Care Act will provide
improved coverage for women
and children.
"Women can no longer be
charged more for just being
women," she said. "Maternity
care must be covered starting
2014."
Dinaro concluded her presen-
tation by encouraging women to
write their legislators about the
importance of the law.
This week, the U.S. Supreme
Court heard three days of argu-
ments regarding the constitu-
tionality of the law, which is in
question largely due to a provi-
sion that requires all Americans
to obtain health insurance.
Maas said though this partic-
ular event was aimed at women,
the ACA benefits. men and
women alike.
"Everyone has a mother,"
Maas said. "A lot of people have
daughters and sisters, and to
deny women certain health care
that men have is an injustice to
all."
Nursing student Kathryn Bri-
eland-Shoultz said she attend-
ed the event to become better
informed about health care
issues.
"I'm in nursing school, and
we're focusing on social justice
issues right now," Brieland-
Shoultz said. "I thought that
Planned Parenthood, especially
the community-based center,
is a great resource and I just
wanted to find out more."

Bigotry based on apperance cannot persist
deas can be a form of violence like any other, and recent events
have shown how easily an idea can turn into actual violence.
Social battles rooted in racial dynamics have been prevalent in
our nation's history since its founding. But at this point in the infor-
mation age, such discrimination is absurd. With the abundance of
resources available to learn understanding and appreciation, not to
mention the expectation of simple moral acceptance, hate crimes
should not exist in 2012. However, the recent killings of Trayvon
Martin, and Shaima Alawadi, which by many accounts were solely as
a result of judgment of appearance accompanied by bigoted ideology,
reflect a horrifying trend toward radical racism. Discrimination on
any basis, whether violent or not, is obscene and unacceptable.

The family has had death threats - the father and
mother, George has had death threats. Anything
related to George is a target."
- Migeul Meza said about the family of his cousin George Zimmerman, who is
suspected of shooting Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.
Emoting politics

The ancient Greeks used the
word paschein as their word
for "emotion." More literally,
paschein trans-
lates to "suffer-
log."
When my
professor stated,
this, sadly, my
first thought
was, "maybe I
have more in
common with ADRIENNE
the Greeks than ROBERTS
I thought." As
of late, I've sub-
consciously allowed myself to be
removed emotionally from what I
hear on television or read in news-
papers.
I know I'm not the only one who
has learned that getting emotional
these days - especially in the world
of politics - can backfire. Many
women, especially young women,
have become hardened to end-
less and degrading statements and
decisions made against them. Even
worse, many women are purposely
ignorant to save themselves the pain
in advance. Ask many of my friends
in college about what's currently
happening in the world of women
and politics -btheyshake their heads
and say something to the effect of,
"Is it even worth it to pay attention?"
From the birth control battle and
insensitive name-calling, to dis-
covering that women pay on aver-
age approximately 30 percent more
than men for health insurance, it
seems like a lost cause. It makes
sense why more young women
aren't publicly speaking out against
these numerous discriminations.
As a woman, when you get up and
passionately take a stand against
inequality in society, you're called

a "slut" or an "ugly feminist," and
consequently, you are either ridi-
culed or made a martyr.
It's a rough world out there for
women. Entering the realm of poli-
tics right now, whether to voice your
opinion or to simply stay informed
aboutcurrent events, is equivalentto
going into battle and realizing that
notonlyyour enemies,butyour com-
rades as well, are taking aim at you.
For example, Rick Santorum
called contraception dangerous and
"not okay," before going on to say
that birth control is "a license to
do things in a sexual realm that is
counter to how things are supposed
to be." When Rick Santorum's
wife, Karen, a neo-natal nurse and
former law student, was inter-
viewed on CNN's Piers Morgan
Tonight this Saturday, and she said,
"Women have nothing to fear when
it comes to contraceptives," claim-
ing that her husband would not
bring his personal religious beliefs
"to play" as president.
As an issue that affects many col-
lege-aged women, it's comforting to
hear that she believes that Santorum
wouldn't bring religion into the poli-
tics of this issue. However, when the
difference between Rick Santorum's
views of contraception and what
Karen Santorum claims he will do
in office is vast, and it makes women
who worried about the issue seem
irrational and just plain wrong. How
could so many women have mis-
interpreted his comments; if what
Karen Santorum says true?
Watching Karen Santorum speak
made me wonder if I had misjudged
nearly everything I had heard and
read up until that point. Claiming
that her husband never made such
comments only further pitted them
against the majority of women. A

complete disregard for his self-righ-
teous and judgmental comments
further trivialized the issue.
Political
involvement is
worth the pain.
While it's beneficial that these
concerns, which are usually avoid-
ed by the media, are being dis-
cussed the way in which they are
talked about makes women seem
less than human. Those in power
are trying to make women obtain
consent from doctors and have a
waiting period before an abortion
and forcibly receive an ultrasound.
They also disregard that women are
paying more for health insurance,
but why? Apparently, it's because
women are just not intelligent
enough to make decisions about
their own personal health.
I understand wanting to hide
under the covers and weather out
this demeaning and seemingly
insane- public movement against
women; it's so much easier to remove
oneselfemotionally fromthe realities
that surround this situation. Unfor-
tunately, it truly is happening. If
young women don't do something to
stop it, the women's social security in
the future may be even further com-
promised, and that prospect alone is
.something worth a little emotion.

In Florida, Trayvon Martin was shot twice
and killed by George Zimmerman, a self-pro-
fessed neighborhood watchdog. When asked
to explain his motive for pulling the trigger,
Zimmerman told police that Martin "looked
like he was up to no good," as evidenced by the
hoodie the teen wore. In California, Shaima
Alawadi was severely beaten, and eventually
died from her wounds. Two notes were found
by her body, the first read "This is my coun-
try, go back to yours terrorist," and the setond
demanded "Go back to your country, you ter,
rorist."'While there are no current suspects,
the tension appears to have been based on
appearance - she wore a head scarf as part of
Islamic tradition.
The insanity of killing a presumably inno-
cent teenager is only amplified by the logic
behind Zimmnerman's suspicion. Following
and subsequently assaulting a teenager based
on nothing but physical appearance is barbar-
ic. A hoodie denotes little more than stylistic
preference or a desire for warmth. Suspicion
based on such petty grounds is thinly dis-
guised racism, which is inexcusable whether

it is explicit or subconscious.
The similarities between Martin's and
Alawadi's killings are clear. Whatever one's
personal views may be, a head scarf alone
says nothing about a person beyond express-
ing religious belief - it is simply a demonstra-
tion of faith, which is protected by the First
Amendment. Religion and political opinion
are often two distinct aspects of any given per-
son's belief system. Faith does not necessarily
align an individual's interests with those of a
faction of religious radicals.
National political uncertainty and eco-
nomic strife in America should not create
frustration toward specific ethnic or religious
groups. The internal social problems we now
face cannot be solved by making strangers into
scapegoats. The first step toward eradicating
discrimination is recognizing it, and the activ-
ism surrounding these killings has reflected
that recognition. It's encouraging that youbth
are utilizing social media to respond to these
issues. It's the upcoming generations' respon-
sibility to be more tolerant than the last, and
bring about an end to bigotry.

Some like it hot

Of course you knw who Trayvon Martin is.
The recent bevy of hate crimes, spearheaded
by the Feb. 26 murder of the African-American
teenager in Florida, is extremely disturbing,
and begs the question of why any of this is hap-
pening - and nota inisolated cases, but simul-
taneously. tRcsptotses to these questions have
been few and far between, but certainly, the
reactions to the events have been interesting.
The Daily Texan, the University of Texas
at Austin's newspaper, released a cartoon-
criticizing "yellow media" in the wake of the
Martin killing. The cartoon depicts a par-
ent sitting on a rocking chair labeled "the
media," reading out loud from a book titled
"Treyvon (sic) Martin and the Case of Yellow
Journalism." The woman is quoting, ,"And
then ... the bigbad white man killed the hand-
some, sweet, innocent colored boy." Though
the paper has since apologized, the cartoon
represents an important point in the wake of
the Facebook status updates, tweets, texts,
remarks and general hubbub.
The distinction between legitimate jour-
nalism and yellow press has been blurred by
the rise of social media. The constant updates
wherever you go, essentially in the form of a
headline, represent a resurgence of yellow
journalism. Except in this case, the media is
the social network itself and the journalists
are the individuals utilizing that network to
communicate.
Every person with a Facebook account
or a Twitter profile is capable of some form
of social journalism. Here the question of
accountability rises: should people be held
responsible for the "news" they publish on
their "news feeds?" Certainly, the vast major-
ity of social media users know little about the
neighborhood relationships Trayvon himself
unwittingly stepped into; the intricacies of
race dynamics in El Cajon, C alif. where an
Iraqi immigrant was Ibutsi;,1ly Icaten Mar. 25;

the psychosis of Sgt. Robert Bales before his
shooting spree in Afghanistan or the child-
adult complex in Africa insinuated by Invis-
ible Children's Kony 2012 video.
So why do people feel obliged, even with
evident lack of information and background
research, to "update" their "statuses" with
such news? Perhaps one implication of the
information age is not only the abundant quan-
tity of information, but also a profound lack of
quality. This is not to say that political activism
is bad. In fact, it's the opposite - it's completely
necessary and appropriate. Social network-
ing is an extremely positive force that creates
momentum for political movements. But the
issue perhaps is people's quick readiness to get
involved before knowing what it is they're get-
ting involved with, and what that involvement
will ask of them.
In the wake of the recent horrifying trag-
edies with causes rooted in discrimination,
word of mouth has been important in spread-
ing the word and protecting rational moral-
ity. However, people on social networks
ought to understand what they are fighting.
for before they raise their arms. Social media
has become a powerful source of yellow
journalism, employing catchy headlines and
quick buzzwords rather than truth or fact. It
is the job of the news to report, and it is the
job of the masses to appreciate and spread
that knowledge, but they must do so in man-
ner that maintains facts and integrity.
Social mediacannot become areliable tool of
political activism if it remains a massive game
of telephone. That activism ought to be genuine
and heartfelt, not peer pressured. Thus, social
media has a great opportunity and a great
responsibility. We, the network, must uphold
journalistic integrity even if the report is only
goingon our 791friends' news feeds.

ast week, sunbathers in
shorts and sandals aban-
doned the library and invad-
ed the Diag.
Celebrating a
heat wave and
high tempera-
tures, students
across campus
shed their win-
ter coats.
Just as anx-K
ious to feel the KRISTEN
sun, magno- KILUK
lias unfurled
their petals,
white cherry blossoms broke free
from budding stems and forsythia
blooms stepped out in a confident
shade of yellow.
Yes, it was beautiful weather - a
delight to the senses after a cold,
bland winter.
This week, however, typical Mich-
igan March was back, with modest
daytime highs and icy overnight
lows. The National Weather Ser-
vice issued freeze warnings across
Michigan early Tuesday morning,
and the Ann Arbor Municipal Air-
port recorded a low temperature of
27 degrees on Tuesday.
While we can retreat to the
warmth of our wool coats, many pre-
mature blossoms have no defense
for the cold - once they're exposed,
their only choie is to blacken and
die. For Michigan fruit farmers -
who depend on those blossoms to
bear their livelihood - the early
spring warm-up was a nightmare.
Though definitive conclusions can-
not be drawn from single weather
events, the 7,000-plus broken high
temperature records across the U.S.
in mid-March, coupled with pro-
jected fluctuations in warm and
cold extremes, suggest that climate
change will make farming, which
is already unpredictable, even more
difficult to manage.
Like other farmers, Jan Upston

of Wasem Fruit Farms in Milan,
Mich. is scratching her head this
season as she watches unseason-
able temperatures fool her plants.
Upston says on her farm everything
is about a month ahead in devel-
opment. "This is way too early,"
Upston said, "We have never had
peach blossoms in March."
As of Tuesday afternoon, Upston
hadn't been out to check her peach-
es due to her busy schedule. She
worries that the farm will lose
much of its fruit crop. "There's
nothing we can do. We can't afford
to bring in helicopters to keep our
plants warm."
Yes, helicopters.
Large farm operations with
enough resources often rent helicop-
ters in times of frost to pull warmer
air from above down to the ground
to keep crops warm. But this method
is cost-prohibitive to many farmers.
Jan also said federal disaster aid
for fruit farmers is hard to come
by. The United States Department
of Agriculture Economic Research
Service reports that commercial
farms - with annual sales over
$250,000 - make up 12.4 percent
of all U.S. farms, but received 62.2
percent of government payments in
2009. The report also states that this
statistic is a "direct result of com-
modity programs targeting certain
types of commodities, which are
often grown on large farms and in
large volumes." With funds chan-
neled primarily to already wealthy
grain producers, it's no wonder that
resources are limited for struggling
fruit farmers.
As evident from the drooping
magnolias around campus, many
ornamental species are also suffer-
ing from the March weather fluctua-
tions. In Holland, Mich., Tulip Time
Festival planners are worried that
they'll have no flowers to celebrate
at their annual festival in early May.
Tulips, like Upston's fruit plants, are

developing a month early, breaking
free from the ground now rather
than their usual third week of April.
In hopes of delaying their develop-
ment, planners are refrigerating
tulips in pots so that they'll have
something to celebrate.
But not
Michigan fruit
farmers.
For Michigan, the early asparagus
crop is also a large concern. Farm-
ers are struggling to harvest what
they can of the already developed
vegetable before spring frosts wipe
them out.
And according to the National
Weather Service, water tempera-
tures in south Lake Michigan are
similar to what is normally seen in
late May and early June.
This isn't the first time Michi-
gan has seen a balmy March - the
record temperature for Detroit in
March clocks in at 82 degrees on
March 28, 1945, according to the
National Weather Service. Weath-
er fluctuates over tine, and this
year could just be an outlier. The
situation this time around, though,
represents a sobering window into
our potential future - one that is
matching climate change projec-
tions and involves increased crop
vulnerability and uncertain season-
al boundaries.
If these trends are indeed a result
of climate change, and we let the
process continue unchecked, Michi-
gan's farming future isn't bound to
be too peachy.

"A "OLE -" But when Beilein begins to diagram his
offense on his basketball-court pin board,
the humble basketball lifer that he truly is
emerges. He's a coach who has feverishly
and ceaselessly studied the strategy of the
game his entire career - "one of the best X
and 0 guys in the business," in the words of
Mike Gansey, his star guard at West Virginia
who led the Mountaineers to the Elite 8 and
Sweet 16 in consecutive years.

breathlessly details what would be overly
complek to most.
You realize Beilein is in complete control
of this offense, and for good reason - it's
all his. Some may have similar principles
in their system, but the minutiae, terminol-
ogy and endless reads Beilein employs are
unique to him. Though the basics come from
some ancestral systems, he has morphed
and twisted his attack into something all his
4 own.
Ever wonder why you don't see other
teams running the Beilein system? It'd be
impossible. The only man who truly knows
its detailed intricacies is Beilein.
"You got these other systems that there's
a blueprint for, and every coach has his own
little wrinkles to it," said Rob Dauster, edi-
T ftor of the basketball blog Ballin' Is A Habit.
"John Beilein basically runs his own thing....
He created his own offense. It's really a lot of
fun to watch."
Beilein really had no choice but to do so.
He had no full-time assistants at LeMoyne
College, the Division II school he was coach-
ing at when he developed his system, so just
about every task for running the program fell
to him. He even drove the team van to road
games. With no assistants to bounce ideas
off, Beilein just devised an offense by him-
self.

non-starter. Taking one out now would space It was the perfect offense for LeMoyne.

"We didn't really havea choice," said Dave
Niland, a guard from 1985-89 and also Tom's
nephew and Beilein's cousin. "It was the only
way we were going to win. We weren't going
to dunk on anybody."
In 1987-88, Beilein really went for it. He
moved 6-foot-4 guard Scott Hicks to the
"four," or power forward position, (20-plus
years before he would do the same thingwith
Zack Novak) and he inserted another guard,
into the lineup. Point guard Russell Barnes
wasn't much of a distributor, but he could
shoot, which was all the system required at
that point.
And a freshman named Len Rauch
emerged at the "five," or center position.
Rauch is now the all-time scoring leader for
LeMoyne, but he was also an expert passer
for a big man. (He recorded 168 assists in his
first season.)
Rauch's ability to dish the ball resulted in
plenty of looks from behind the 3-point line,
which had just been instituted by the NCAA
in 1986.
The Dolphin shooters took to the 3-pointer
well, hitting 44.6 percent of their attempts. If
Beilein had any doubts about his new system,
the 1987-88 season erased them.
"It was match made in heaven, if you will,"
Rauch said. "I wouldn't trade those years for
anything, playing for him."
The principles of the Beilein offense aren't
necessarily unique. The system rests on
plenty of downscreens; backscreens; hard,
precise cutting; lots of motion 3-pointers and
now, ball screens. It requires focus, effort,
teamwork, and most importantly, selfless-
ness.,
Even if every player won't be shooting the
ball on every possession, each will be touch-
ing it. The offense works because the play-
ers themselves and the ball move around so
much. Eventually, a defender will lose posi-
tion - that gives Beilein's players leverage,
meaning they've gained the advantage and
can drive or find a good shot.
But the system can only run efficiently if
its players are willing to sacrifice their points
and make the next pass, which will almost
always result in a better shot or better posi-
tioning. It's why Rauch says that unselfish-
ness is an "underlying fundamental" of the
offense.

"It's gotto be a guy that values the assist as
much as he values the score - a team player,"
Beilein said of the type of player he looks to
recruit. "Not that you can't teach that, but
we like to find guys that really feel the game
more than just their own game."
But every coach would like to have unself-
ish players, and every coach would like to
have a disciplined attack - look at any suc-
cessful team and you'll usually find those
traits.
What sets Beilein's system apart is its
open-endedness. On any given trip down the
court, there are countless possible ways for
the offense to unfold. It all depends on what
the defense does.
Run the offense,-see how the defense plays
it, then react accordingly. No matter how
the defense tries to stop the attack, there's
a way for the offense to respond - in fact, it
depends on responding to a defense based on
the way it tries to counter Beilein's action.
"It's sort of organized confusion, it's read
and react," Beilein said. "If one guy does one
thing, it changes the whole thing. ... Now
everybody's got to see that and go to the next
phase of it. ... Nobody talked about it, (it's
just) 'I saw what you saw, you saw what I saw,
we don't have'to call a new play.'
"The ball talked, and said 'run this
instead.'
It can be dizzying. That's an awful lot for
a college kid to process, and it doesn't help
that he has a defender hounding him as he's
trying to analyze the opposition and react
accordingly.
"You've just got to read every single little
part of the game when you're on the offen-
sive end," said senior guard Stu Douglass.
"It's tough sometimes.... You've justgot tobe '
ready for that (sudden change)."
For example, Jordan Morgan sets an off-
ball screen for Tim Hardaway Jr. in the cor-
ner. The defender prevents Hardaway Jr.
from coming off the screen. Hardaway Jr.
is supposed to read that and know that he
should fake a back cut and then try and cut
back again off Morgan's screen.
That's why Beilein's system also requires
intelligent players. But that's something he's
had at every stop of his peripatetic coaching
career.

BEILEIN
From Page 5
Beilein, young and full of ambi-
tion, took the job at Canisius, Tom
Niland's alma mater, in 1992. He
met a familiar face at his new gig
- Dave Niland was an assistant at
Canisius under the previous staff.
Beilein, without a staff to bring,
retained the assistants already
there.
Familiarity aside, it was a big
career move to Division I. But he
had no doubt that he was taking
his offense with him.
The issue was that the Golden
Griffins didn't have a roster like
LeMoyne, so adjustments were
necessary. But that was a good
thing. Canisius wouldn't be con-
fused with a high-major squad,
but the team was much more ath-
letic than the Dolphins, especially
atthe "five" spot.
Beilein went from Len Rauch
to a Jamaican-born Canadian
center named Michael Meeks. In
doing so, he went from a skilled,
unathletic big man to one with a
lot more bounce in his step. That
allowed Beilein to get Meeks more.
involved with movement, which
in turn allowed the guards to be
more active and saw them do more
backscreening.
It's been the same story at every
stop, Beilein tweaking his offense
to fit the players that he has. It
reveals another hallmark of his
system: flexibility.
"We're not always right, but we
keep changing to find the answer,"
Beilein said. "We're never shtis-
fied. Never."
When Beilein moved on to
Richmond in 1997, he found him-
self with a big man named Eric
Poole. Unlike Rauch and Meeks,
Poole wasn't particularly athletic.
or skilled, but he could rebound.
Once again, Beilein adapted to his
talent.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

When he left for West Virginia
in 2002, there was an incoming
recruit named Kevin Pittsnogle
who had committed to ex-coach
Gale Catlett. An unknown at
that point, he would later take
the country by storm in the 2005
NCAA Tournament. After all, a
6-foot-11 sharpshooter is an odd-
ity - but in Beilein's ever-adapting
offense, Pittsnogle found his per-
fect niche.
For Beilein, it's all about.the
details. So even when he reached
West Virginia and the big-time Big
East, the Mountaineers constant-
ly practiced fundamentals. The
team would spend 30 or so min-
utes every practice just on shoot-
ing, and would devote about 20 to
walking through the offense.
Beilein got to Michigan in 2007,
finallyreachingthe pinnacle of his
career. By then, installing his sys-
tem was old hat. The Wolverines
were excited when they found out
Beilein would be their coach. Pret-
ty much all they knew was that
his offense meant a lot of 3-point-
ers, which was good news for the
team's many shooters.
So imagine Michigan's shock
when, during Beilein's very first
practice, the team began with
passing, layup lines and catch-
ing the ball with two feet. It was
a flashback to youth basketball in
that way.
Some Wolverines struggled
with picking up the offense at
first, such as then-walk-on Dave
Merritt, while. others thrived in
it immediately. That's the pat-
tern everywhere Beilein's been.
Despite its reputation, the offense
isn't overly complex, but every
player is different when it comes
to picking it up.
Most players on the current
Michigan team have adjusted
well, particularly point guard
Trey Burke, who amazed Beilein
with his ability to do so this sea-
son

Elsewhere, Beilein's son Pat-
rick played for him at West Vir-
ginia and was a natural in the
system, havingstudied it when his
father was coaching at Richmond.
Gansey, meanwhile, played well
immediately, but it was such an
involved offense that even in the
2006 Sweet 16 against Texas inhis
last-ever college game, Beilein had
to lay into him at halftime for not
executing properly.
The biggest alteration in the
offense to date has been the preva-
lence of the high ball screen at
Michigan. After three years of
running the system in more typi-
cal fashion in Ann Arbor, Beilein
began employing the ball screen
with Darius Morris in 2010-11
and ramped it up even more with
Burke this year.
Beilein's added it because he
can - Morris and Burke are ath-
letic enough to be able to make
plays off the pick-and-roll. It
removes the need to make mul-
tiple passes around the floor, like
LeMoyne was forced to do. Lever-
age comes much more easily.
It's a credit to Beilein that he can
integrate something so different
to his offense almost seamlessly.
But he's used to fine-tuning, hav-
ing done so at four other schools
already.
"He has done a remarkable job
at every level of getting guys to
play together," said Dave Niland,
now the head coach at Division-III
Penn State-Behrendt. "He really
understands the team game. ... It's
amazing to me how he's been able
to get guys to buy in and share the
ball."
It was a clinic.
Dec. 22, 2005 will forever live
in the minds of that West Virginia
team as the day when its offense
could absolutely not be stopped.
The Mountaineers had charged

their way to the Elite 8 the year
before, but they were unranked
and a 7.5-point underdog going
into the nightcap of the All-Col-
lege Classic against No. 8 Okla-
homa. The Sooners, coached by
Kelvin Sampson and led by Taj
Gray, Kevin Bookout and Terrell
Everett, were essentially playing
at home with the game in Okla-
homa City.
"We had no business winning
thatgame," Patrick Beilein said.
But like it had done so many
times before - like it was built to
do - the offense made up for West
Virginia's athleticism deficiency,
and then some. The Sooners tried
to take away the Mountaineers'
3-point shooting by pressuring
them.
Beilein, Gansey, Pittsnogle
and company responded by back-
cutting Oklahoma to death, and
with ease. It was almost comical
how many times 'a simple back-
screen would result in an uncon-
tested layup for West Virginia.
The Mountaineers were running
circles around the Sooners.
"They were just dumbfounded,"
Gansey said.
West Virginia won, 92-68, and
went 32-for-48 from the field. At
66.7 percent, it stands as the sec-
ond-best shooting performance in
program history.
If this was the offense at its
best, the question becomes, how
do you stop it?
The easy answer is to hope
Beilein's team isn't making its
3-pointers. Critics say that the
offense is too reliant on the out-
side shot, that if the system lives
by the three and dies by the three,
it too often dies.
Players vouch for the system
by pointing out that 3-pointers
allowed them to spring plenty of
upsets, and if they were missing in
a game, they at least weren't turn-
ing the ball over, allowing them to
stay in it even if open shots weren't

falling.
Aside from that, the key to
slowing down the Beilein offense
seems to be disruption. Get the
team out of its rhythm. Don't allow
it to get comfortable. Overwhelm
the traditional Beilein player with
your superior length and athleti-
cism.
"You want to be extremely
physical and you want to try to
crash the glass, limit Michigan's
opportunities to score," Merritt
said. "If I was an opposing coach,
I would also try to take away the
sideline passes."
Gansey always struggled
against Pittsburgh because
guards like Ronald Ramon and
Carl Krauser weren't afraid to get
physical. Theybumped him off his
cutting paths, and even a slight
alteration like that is enough to
confound an offense that rests so
much on precision.
But stopping the offense is
easier said than done because it
is extremely hard to prepare for.
Michigan assistant coach LaVall
Jordan knows that firsthand,
having spent three years trying
to prep for the system while on
Iowa's staff.
"They're really tough to scout
because a lot of their plays are
based on what you do defensively,
not necessarily set plays," said for-
mer Maryland coach Gary Wil-
liams, whose team played against
Beilein in the 2009 ACC/Big Ten
Challenge. "They take good shots
and they're not afraid to make the
extra pass to get a guy the best
shot."
John Beilein's mind is always
working. You get the sense that
there hasn't been a moment in
which he wasn't thinking about
basketball since the day he was
hired as coach at Newfane High
School in western New York in
1975.
with a roster full of players with
bounce, so long as they still have
the necessary skill and smarts.
The cavalry begins to arrive
next season with forward Mitch
McGary and wings Glenn Rob-
inson III and Nick Stauskas. Add
that trio to Hardaway Jr. and Mor-
gan, and as long as Burke stays in
school, Beilein will have the kind
of athletic riches he's wanted for
so long. The ability to recruit such
players is one of the chief reasons
he came to Michigan.
"I can only imagine (how the
offense will perform)," Patrick
said. "I think it will take off. He's
dreamed about having these type
of athletes within the offense. ... I
think he's very excited"
McGary's arrival is especially
intriguingsince Morgan is already
entrenched at center. Can the two
play together? It would go against

the way the offense has operated
before, but if history holds true,
Beilein will find a way to make
it work. Len Rauch has a son
named Jack, a freshman in high
school who Len hopes will have
all the same basketball opportu-
nities he once did. Like Beilein,
Rauch now has the mind of a
coach. He helps out the varsity at
his alma mater, Bishop Ludden,
in Syracuse, and coaches a sum-
mer AAU team.
He watches Michigan games
with Jack, and for Len, it's like
watching himself back at LeM-
oyne. The system has changed, *
but much of it is the same, and
Len knows his old coach's offense
so well that he'll tell Jack what's
about to happen before it does.
Len knows it because'he lived it.
Every former playerreached for
this story watches their old coach
and his new team now, able to rat-
tle off the strengths of each player.
They say "we" or "us" when talk-
ing about Michigan, before cor-
recting themselves.
But you can't blame them. The
faces and the uniforms are differ-
ent, but the offense is so familiar.
"I think (Beilein .is) underap-
preciated to some degree, but the
people that are basketball minds
in the game out there today rec-
ognize his ability," Rauch said.
"(When Beilein was hired at Mich-
igan), I said to one of my friends
and fellow players, 'it's going to be
a matter of time before they're in
contention for the Big Ten.'
"It won't be that long. He just
needed to getrsome of those kids in
that system."
Five seasons in, Beilein has
proven Rauch a prophet. With
more and more talent knocking on
the door, Beilein finally has what
he dreamed of as he navigated
those bitter Syracuse winters
behind the wheel of the LeMoyne
team van.
The offense has been modified
plenty already, with Beilein tun-
ing it at every possible moment. It
is impossible to know what it may
look like in the future, but you can
count on a few new wrinkles -
they're constantly being added.
Beilein's offense hums along at
Michigan now. More tweaks may
be made; more players may thrive;
more championships maybe won.
But the foundation was set 25
years ago by a young coach search-
ing for a way to get ahead in Divi-
sion-I.
They will not know this, but if
the Wolverines ascend any podi-
ums in the future, they will be
standing on the shoulders of Len
Rauch and Scott Hicks, of Dave
Niland and Russell Barnes, of
Michael Meeks and Eric Poole,
of Kevin Pittsnogle and Patrick
Beilein and Mike Gansey.
They will not know this, but
John Beilein will.

Michigan opens Big Ten season

By ISABELLA ACHENBACH
Daily Sports Writer
Here comes the big one. After
seven weeks of being on and off the
road playing a total of 25 games,
the Michigan baseball team will
finally begin the Big Ten season
this weekend at
Minnesota. Michigan at
Record-wise,
the two teams Minnesota

"We know
Minnesota has
really good pitchers," said junior
outfielder Patrick Biondi. "We
know they're going to be close
games, so we just have to compete
a lot better than we did (at Eastern
Michigan)."
Wednesday's game against
Eastern Michigan ended in a dis-
appointing 12-2 loss. Biondi and
freshman infielder Dylan Delaney
were the only players to score
runs, and the Wolverines fin-
ished with only three walks and 11
strikeouts. It was not an encourag-
ing game leading into Big Ten play.
Pitching is perhaps the largest
area that Michigan coach Rich
Maloney is focusing on in practice.
The top-three starting pitchers -
senior right-hander Brandon Sin-
nery, redshirt junior left-hander
Bobby Brosnahan and junior
right-hander Ben Ballantine - did
not play in Wednesday's game so
that they could rest up for the start

Blue heads down to
Indiana for three

Junior pitcher Ben Ballentine and Michigan are prepared for a "dog fight" this weekend to open the Big Ten slate.

of the conference season.
"Three good pitchers that we
got going, Sinnery, Brosnahan,
and Ballantine, are going to have a
dog fight because they've got some
outstanding pitching at Minneso-
ta," Maloney said. "They're going
to have to pitch really well in Big
Ten play for us to be successful,
and that's really the bottom line."
Freshman right-hander James
Bourque, sophomore right-hander
Alex Lakatos, redshirt sophomore
left-hander Logan McAnallen and
redshirt freshman right-hander
Jay Perry split time on the mound
against the Eagles.
"When you're getting guys who
are inexperienced pitching out
there, you don't know what you're
going to get," Maloney said.
Maloney was pleased with
Perry's relief performances in
Wednesday's game and Tuesday's
game against Oakland.

"Two games in a row, he's come
in and done a nice job, therefore
he will get more opportunities,"
Maloney said. "We're waiting for
some other guys to step up."
Biondi is the player to keep
an eye out for right now. He's
the leadoff hitter and has scored
more runs than any other Wol-
verine this season. In the last four
games, he had more hits than any
other Wolverine. He also has the
third-highest batting average,
.323, behind sophomore outfielder
Michael O'Neill and freshman
outfielder Will Drake.
According to Maloney, Drake
has been "consistent" and O'Neill
."needs to get hot again." O'Neill
was named to the Big Ten Play-
ers to Watch list at the start of the
season and was also honored as
the Big Ten Co-Player of the Week
on Feb. 27 and then claimed the
honor outright on March 5.

Minnesota's TJ Oakes is one of
the starting pitchers that could
cause problems for Michigan. His
ERA is the team's lowest at 1.56,
he's pitched a total of 40.1 innings,
and he is 4-1 in his six starts. Of
the Golden Gopher pitchers, he
leads with 27 strikeouts.
Ballantine is statistically the
best starting pitcher for the Wol-
verines this season. He's pitched
38.2 innings and has struck out
29 batters. But his ERA, which is
the second best for the Wolverines
after Brosnahan, is 2.56, a full run
worse than Oakes'.
It's goingto come down to more
than just great pitching from
Michigan to come out on top this
weekend and throughout the rest
of the Big Ten season.
The Wolverines are going to
need to make timely hits, play
their best defense and steal some
bases.

walk-off grand slam to end the
game in six innings. And the bats
don't seem to be cooling off any-
time soon.
"I think we are playing with
confidence, swinging with con-
fidence," said Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins. "Hopefully we'll
carry that with us on to Bloom-
ington."
No. 20 Michigan (3-0 Big Ten,
22-9 overall) takes on the Hoo-
siers (1-2, 16-15), who dropped
two of three games in their
conference-opening series with
Ohio State last weekend.
Indiana boasts a roster full
of offensive talent, but unlike
Michigan, lacks a solid pitching
staff. Both of the Hoosiers' start-
ers have an ERA over 4.00, and
just like Penn State's Lisa Aka-
mine, they have struggledto con-
trol their releases.
Sophomore lefty Meagan
Murphy and freshman righty
Lora Olsen have recorded over
50 strikeouts each, but both also
have high walk totals - a good
sign for the Wolverines, who
have recently thrived with run-
ners on base.
In its last series, Michigan tal-
lied 26 RBIs and drew 20 walks,
two stats that Hutchins was
proud of after a mediocre offen-
sive showing in nonconference
play. As the offense is produc-
ing to its potential, the Wolver-

ine pitching has been consistent
as well. Freshman lefty Haylie
Wagner has been the go-to start-
er for Michigan, pitching33more
innings and recording 29 more
strikeouts than fellow freshman
pitcher Sara Driesenga.
Though Driesenga has seen
limited action in the circle, she's
produced on offense. The Hud-
sonville, Mich. native has been
the designated player - similar
to the designated hitter in base-
ball - in nine games this season
and has put up a .391 average
while batting in six runs. After
the series against Penn State,
Hutchins emphasized the impor-
tance of the bottom of the lineup
producing offense, and Dries-
enga has been a key part of that.
The rest of the bottom of
the lineup - freshman catcher
Lauren Sweet, junior second
baseman Amy Knapp and Sap-
pingfield - has also stepped up.
Sweet earned Big Ten Freshman
of the Week honors this week
after going 5-for-6 and drawing
four walks against the Nittany
Lions last week. Along with the
consistent hitters, such as senior
first baseman Amanda Chidester
and senior center fielder Bree
Evans, the Wolverines boast a
strong lineup heading to Bloom-
ington. But Indiana has offen-
sive threats, too. Sophomore left
fielder Jenna Abraham's .354
batting average and 22 runsleads
the team, while redshirt senior
Cassie Gogreve leads the team
in RBIs with 19 and boasts a .319
average as the clean-up hitter.
Four other Hoosiers boast
.300-plus averages and the
senior leadership on the team
has helped their offense over the
course of the season.
Wagner and Driesenga, who
have quickly gained confidence
and poise inthe circle, have done
a good job against experienced
batters and will again be faced
with a challenginglineup.
But for Hutchins, it's not the
pitching that will be the key to a
sweep of Indiana.
"Our team evolves, and I told
them a few weeks ago that it's
about what we become and we're
becoming," she said. "But we
have a lot of games in front of
us, and we still have to stay one-
game and one-pitch focused."

Brown forgoes senior season at Michigan

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan junior forward Chris
Brown has decided to forgo his
senior year and sign with' the
Phoenix Coyotes' organization,
a release from the hockey club
announced Thursday. The deal is
a three-year, entry-level contract.
Financial terms were not made
available.
"We are disappointed with
Chris' decision to leave Michigan
and not graduate with his class,"
said Michigan coach Red Beren-
son in a statement.
Brown was expected to be one
of the team's leaders if he were to
return. The Flower Mound, Tex.
native posted 29 points in 2011-12,
a career high.
He was a member of the
CCHA's all-rookie team dur-
ing his freshman season, and his
through-the-legs goal against
Miami (Ohio) earned the fan vote
for CCHA Play of the Year.
In an exclusive interview
with the Daily, assistant general
manager of the Phoenix Coyotes
Brad Treliving said that he feels
Brown's playing style more eas-
ily fits in the professional leagues,
rather than college hockey.
For the majority of the season,
which ended. last weekend in an
upset, overtime loss to Cornell

through the Michigan athletic
department.
"This was a very difficult deci-
sion for me to make, but at the
same time I am excited about this
opportunity."
Brown first came to Ann Arbor
in 2007 after being chosen to join
the United States' National Team
Developmental Program.
He was the first-ever Michigan
hockey recruit to hail from down
in Texas.
During the team's end-of-sea-
son media availability session on
Monday, junior defenseman Lee
Moffie spoke critically of any of
his classmates that would con-
sider leaving the program.
Sophomore defenseman Mac
Bennett, echoed that sentiment,
while simultaneously renewing
his vows to Berenson and Michi-
gan.
"I'm coming back for sure,"
Bennett said. "I'm not ready to
leave this place yet. I love it too
much."
Brown remains in Ann Arbor,
where he is finishing up a class.
Treliving was unsure when
Brown will report to Portland,
Maine, where the Coyotes' AHL
affiliate is located,but did say he'd
have a better idea on Friday.
Michigan is scheduled to vote
on next season's captains on
Thursday.

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Junior forward Chris Brown signed a contract with the Phoenix Coyotes.

in the NCAA Midwest Regional,
Brown skated on the top Wolver-
ine line with David Wohlberg,
now a member of the Albany
Devils of the American Hockey
League, and freshman Alex Gup-
till, a Dallas Stars' draftee. The
Coyotes selected Brown with

their second-round pick in the
2009 draft.
"I want to thank the Michigan
coaching staff, my teammates
and all the fans who have made
my three years in Ann Arbor an
experience that I will cherish for-
ever," Brown said in a statement

EVENT PREVIEW TV REVIEW
Sixth Annual FestiFools
to celebrateApril1

'U' students make,
share their puppet
creations with A2
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily Arts Writer
Looking for a particularly
foolish way to spend the first
of April this year, but tired of
the same old
pranks and FestiFools
tricks? The
sixth annual Sunday at
FestiFools will 4 p.m.
offer an artis- Downtown
tic experience Ann Arbor
for April Fool's
Day enthusi- Free
asts.
In 2006, Mark Tucker, the
arts director for the Lloyd Hall
Scholars Program, decided to
take the idea of street theater to
the next level for University stu-

dents.As part of his Art in Pub-
lic Spaces course, Tucker had
his students create giant paper-
mach6 puppets to assist a local
theater production.
Six years later, this foray
into student puppeteering has
become one of the most talked-
about events in Ann Arbor.
Tucker wrote in an e-mail
interview that FestiFools is a
non-profit public art perfor-
mance unrestrained by a tradi-
tional theater, sponsored by the
University, City of Ann Arbor
and civic, corporate and private
donors.
"Ultimately, we're exposing a
broad spectrum of people to this
entertaining brand of public art
as a vehicle for celebrating and
supporting creativity and visual
literacy," Tucker wrote.
While the actual parade will
take place on Sunday, FestiFools
isn't merely a one-act show.
From dusk to midnight tomor-

row, mischief-makers eager to
get an early start on festivities
can attend FoolMoon, a proces-
sion of handmade, illuminated
sculptures throughout the
streets of Ann Arbor.
Besides viewing the sculp-
ture procession, attendees will
have the opportunity to witness
street-sized shadow-puppet
performances, experimental
silent films and other surprises.
In addition, Tucker wrote that
Spontaneous Art, a performance
art collective, will create live
video games for festival-goers.
"They will be dressed in robot
suits and provide challenges
similar to obstacle courses or
light sports," Tucker wrote.
"Players will have to dodge,
jump, duck, aim, throw and step
quickly to make it to the next
level."
Art & Design Prof. Nick Tobi-
er, whose students produce the
puppets for FestiFools, said he

can't wait for the students to
march down Main Street with
their creations.
."You know, as we round the
corner and enter, I'm just look-
ing forward to seeing the looks
(in) their eyes," Tobier said. "It's
great to be part of some event in
which you're both part of Ann
Arbor and part of the Univer-
sity. I think-that happens all too
rarely."
Art & Design freshman Kelly
Sadlon, one of the students
involved in the parade, said she
can't wait to see the reactions
of the children in the audience
when they catch a glimpse of the
puppets.
"Events like this bring atten-
tion not only to Ann Arbor, but
to the art school and art itself,"
Sadlon said. "It's parades like
these that make children and
adults aware of art who may not
typically be exposed to art in
their everyday lives."
